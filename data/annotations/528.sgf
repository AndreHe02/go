C[DS:  This is a
game I played against
yuf on IGS.  He was rated as 9k but also
told me he had a 6k account too.  I have added comments on this game on
postmortem review and have marked them with "DS:".  Please let me know your
comments and suggestions.];B[pd]BL[47];W[dp]C[
 auriga 9k : i do the same with weaker players
too!]WL[49];B[fq]C[Ovidiu: no comments.]BL[31];W[qo]WL[38];AB[jp]
[nq]AW[pq]C[Ovidiu: next move should be K4 and after W
Q3, B O3 black has a
nice shape. If B would move at Q3, W would keep in pressure both black
stones with
K4.];AB[pq]AW[jp]AE[nq]C[Ovidiu: this isn't good for
black.];AE[pq][jp];B[dd]BL[28];W[ip]SQ[pq]C[Ovidiu: next B G4, W D6, B
D2, W P4, B K16]WL[35];AB[gp][dr][jd]AW[dn][op]SQ[lp]C[Ovidiu: with a stone required into the
marked field, W has to be
careful.];AE[op][gp][dr][jd];B[dn]C[Ovidiu: B come from the other
direction so W should get
advantage.]BL[21];W[fp]WL[30];B[gp]C[Ovidiu: the sequence should be: W F5, B
E3, W D3, B G5, W
G6, B H5, W K5, B H6, WG7... Now W has strengthened his stones and a B
invasion isn't so
dangerous for W in the lower-left side (due to black group weakness).]

 auriga 9k : is entering byo-yomi
DS:  I think W should have played F5 instead of G5.
Ovidiu: Yes.]WL[19];B[ep]C[Ovidiu: Well done.]BL[597];W[fo]
C[Ovidiu: next
sequence is also good
for B:  B D3, W E5, B E3. If W strengthen his stones taking care do not be
cut with B D5 you have
the time to play in C10 or D10 and destroy all his influence, while W still
have no defined
teritory in the lower-right corner, having to play around the marked
points.]WL[17];AB[dq][eq]AW[eo]SQ[lp][pq][cj][dj]CR[do];AB[eo]
AE[eq][dq];C[Ovidiu: now you got the corner and W get
influence.]BL[596];W[eq]WL[12];B[dq]BL[590];W[er]C[DS: I
thought for a while
about my next move.  I considered F2, but didn't
think it would work to catch the two W stones, so I played for the corner
instead by playing D2.
Ovidiu: B should play C4 to end in sente after W D2, B C3, W
F2(necessary).]WL[9];B[dr]BL[556];W[fr]WL[2];B[cp]C[
 yuf 9k*: is entering byo-yomi]BL[550];W[gq]C[Ovidiu: not necessary.

AW[gr][iq][ir];AW[gq]AE[gr][hq][hr][iq][ir][fq];B[jd]C[DS: I
also thought
that this sequence would be better for me retaining sente to make
san-ren-sei at
the top.
Ovidiu: B take a huge advantage. Well done.]BL[541];W[en]C[Ovidiu: the W group is very strong so a corner attack (in the
upper-right) at R14
would shaken B influence.]WL[596];AW[qf][pj]AB[nd]SQ[pq][np]
C[Ovidiu: W gain
teritorry and if B invades
in one of the marked points W would create teritory in both board sides by
running B group to the
center.];AE[nd][qf][pj];B[do]BL[539];W[mq]WL[585];B[cg]C[DS: this might have been
slow.  Maybe I should have played R10 or D10 instead.
Ovidiu: Q10 is a good move forcing W to handle the missing stone in
R3.]BL[483];W[ci]C[Ovidiu:
should be at R14. If W want to invade he should do it by playing into the
upper-left side. B
needs to deal with the W E7 move that would destroy a lot of his influence,
so W would have time
to reduce B teritory.]WL[570];B[ck]BL[456];W[em]C[Ovidiu: the W stone is
weak. Don't come at a
weak group from a strong position. W F11 would be just
fine.]WL[563];B[dm]C[Ovidiu: B E9 would
stop W influence and would keep pressure on the lonely
stone.]BL[452];W[dl]WL[559];B[cl]BL[437];W[dk]WL[555];B[dj]
BL[432];W[di]C[Ovidiu: W E10 would threaten B with
a connection and
after B's answer a corner invasion (into upper-left) would be
fine.]WL[542];B[ej]BL[408];W[el]C[
 auriga 9k : if you see any stupid moves i make please tell me after i make
them!

 auriga 9k : thanks.

W.]BL[374];W[cf]WL[518];B[df]C[DS: I worked out that W

sente.]WL[483];AW[cc][qf][pj]AB[ec][nd]AE[bc];AW[bc]AE[qf][pj]

a great point.]BL[229];W[ff]C[Ovidiu: B shouldn't fear this move beacause
isn't a kikashi. If B
tenuki after W E14, B C15 , W B15, B connect at D15.]WL[475]
;B[ce]BL[226];W[be]C[DS: W had the corner but I had enormous
thickness on the top.  I was a bit worried about the aji in W's F14
stone.]WL[473];B[da]BL[219];W[cb]WL[468];B[pj]C[DS: ... but I still
came out with the
last large point at Q10.
Ovidiu: quite a great move.]BL[173];W[nf]C[
 auriga 9k : has entered byo-yomi again
Ovidiu: hard to answer at this invasion. B Q14 and K10 seems to me good
points.]WL[464];B[jf]C[DS: I was concerned about
playing O16 or Q14 with W having a stone at F14.
Ovidiu: a stone at F14 isn't so dangerous due to W weakness. You could cut
his stones in two
easy, and one of his groups would die.]BL[565];W[nc]C[Ovidiu: the move
should be on the other
side in order to keep B Q10 stone separate from the others.]

extend to R8 or connect at
P12. If he connect he will survive with his group but B would have a lot of
influence toward W
lower stones. If W jump, B would cut and will build teritory on the center,
and later he can
invade the lower-right corner.]BL[288];W[pg]WL[527];B[mi]C[Ovidiu: B should continue to keep pressure on W's group by
