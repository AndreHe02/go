;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[nq]C[Enclosing the corner in upper left with C15 or D15 is more urgent than approaching a 4-4 stone.]
;W[kq]C[Upper left is also most urgent for w.

snip:After the game, I got out a joseki book to look this over, and found that it doesn't include a 2 space low pincer.  Should I infer, then, that this is a poor move?

I can only guess to the answer, because it is not obvious to me why this cannot be an acceptable move.   The choices for black followup probably make L3 either too narrow or too wide, so it will become inefficient.

If w blocks at R3, then w would want his stone to be at M3, if he blocks at Q3 then he would want his stone eithe closer so he gains sente or further away so he gains larger potential.]

C[robertm: So the question here is, is L3 too narrow or too wide.  I find it hard to be certain.]
;B[ce];W[jc]C[K17 is a good point];B[mc];W[gc];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]
;W[gq]LB[jq:a]C[snip: 'a' better?

G3 seems good move to take away black's base];B[jq];W[kr]C[Seems the center is more important so I think L2 should be at L5]
;B[go];W[dq]C[D3 seem to create an over concentrated position, perhaps c5 could be considered]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[ln];W[mn]LB[mo:a]C[I was uncomfortable with all the cutting points here, but playing 'a' seemed too submissive.

Yes, w position seems strong enough to double hane.];B[nr];W[ns]
;B[jr];W[ls];B[mm];W[nn];B[lm];W[qc]C[What do you think of this move?

I think the area is good, but the outside seems it could be more valuable than the corner.  You could conside R16 or S16 approaches. Black should block at R16, but since he blocked at Q17 you have  gained]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]C[B should hane at R15. Extention is only necessary if w has a stone st O17]
;W[rf];B[fq];W[fp]C[black is strong so this stone is not that valuable right now.  The left side has the most potential and black must spend a second stone to capture]
;B[gp];W[fr];B[hq];W[eq];B[gr]C[Good, white did not connect the unimportant ko]
;W[ci]TR[go][jo][ko][ln][lm][mm]LB[cj:a][cg:b][cl:c]C[Help with this move would be good.

I couldn't figure out where to put this stone.  I wanted to crowd the upper left corner some, and get a group in front of the marked "wall".    A would have been a little safer, leaving room for an extension to 'b'

'c' might have done more for the lower right corner, but that's pretty thick, so I didn't want to play near it.  Black is thick over there too.

robertm: I lean towards C6 as the place to play , This creates a large corner with good shape. if b want to take C10 then white can have the right side or fight with C12.]
;B[dl]TR[ci]SQ[gc][jc]C[But after this move, I was facing two weak groups (marked).

The top group cannot really be considered weak.

C6 still appeals to me.];W[cl]LB[cm:a]C[I figured I better get settled, so I attached here.  I didn't like the prospect of black getting a secure base around 'a' and undercutting my lower left corner though.]
;B[dk]C[Black went for influence instead.

Yes, b should probably C7 instead];W[ck];B[gl];W[dm]C[D7 look like an important point]
;B[ql];W[ok];B[mk];W[dj];B[cg]C[C13 is a small move , it only gains a few points and does not have much potential]
;W[gi]LB[ek:a]C[This seemed to be good at limiting the effectiveness of black's lower group and also helps the white group at the top.  I figured I could connect to the left by sacrificing a stone at 'a' if necessary.

Yes, I like G11];B[qi];W[pg]C[Q13 seeparates two strong groups.  You might consider M16 which helps the liower group and reduces some b potential]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[kc];W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[jd];W[id];B[kd];W[kf]
;B[ib]C[This move surprised me.

It is good for stealing the base (if b continues with G18 , but white is out into the center so it is not that useful. B F18 contadicts previous moves.]

;W[gg]C[G13 was very good point];B[ej]C[E9 had no purpose, so b trying to capture it and w trying to use it are not good.]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[fi]C[This connection was not important, better to take A15]
;B[mi];W[gj];B[fk];W[mg]C[N13 seems to be in neutral territory, perhaps w can play N15]

LB[oi:a]C[I misread this move.  In hindsight, I would play at 'a'

Yes S11 work, b cannot s12];B[ri];W[qj];B[pj];W[pi];B[oj];W[qh]

;W[qg];B[ol];W[pl];B[pm];W[mp]C[I was afraid again of dying down here.  I counted and found I could sacrifice the 3 stones and still win, so didn't fight it.

Looks like it was ok to save the group, but if you are not sure, then you must play inside.]
