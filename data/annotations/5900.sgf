C[
I'm white in this game. It was a tournament match for Iwamoto.

cooper:
playing against the fuseki black played can be intimidating -- you have to jus
t have confidence that you can reduce later -- pros and strong amatures are ha
ppy to give black the moyo for the corner territory--];B[pd]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]C[I'm still trying to get a solid feel for the opening. Since he'd taken the 
star points, and if I took the 3-4 point at the bottom he'd be able to make a 
kakari immediately, I took the other star point.];B[pj];W[nq]
C[Looking back, perhaps I should have completed the san-rei, but I didn't wan
t ot get behind.

cooper: you played well --  good to be aggressive];B[lq]
(;W[jq]LB[jq:A][lq:B][nq:C]C[I was trying to ensure development of the stone at D4.

--

cooper: ok --

to analyze this sequence -=- think about it this way -

if you had played A first -- and black checks with B -- invading so early with
 C would be questionable --

in this case playing into the corner (3-3)would have been better - see variation]

see the correct black  variation-- and compare to the joseki--]
;W[kr];B[oq]
(;W[jp]C[I ignored the stone at P3, because I couldn't develop there anymore, 
and both walled off territory and forced M4 here. Anything better?

--

cooper:: this is an ok move,  a bit slow if black tenuki

you can think about the fact that black doesn't have a good move in this area because of his weak shape -- see var.]

e match.

cooper: 
its funny you say that -- if anything this is the losing move for black -- 
it helps to secure some 20 points of territory -- but it misses the bigger pic
ture -- its much better to play at A -- creating a huge moyo

giving you the chance to play at A yourself is a losing stratagy]

(;W[dm]C[cooper:  not good -- gives black a nice cutting point for use
 in the future];B[qm]C[I felt the need to shore up my hole at D7, but then Black got
 to finish securing his area along the right side. What else should I have don
e?

--
cooper: a move around D7 (preferable D6) was necessary --

positional judgement::

black has a good amount of points on the right... but you have a big area in t
he lower part of the board and the top left -- counting points the game is abo
ut even, but white has a chance to attack blacks weak stone at M17 -- 

its essential to watch to board for potentially weak groups to harrass  --]

(;W[jm]LB[nd:A]C[this is ok -- but a move at A is absolutely essential--

by attacking the isolated black stone you will reduce blacks potential on the 
right];B[dn];W[en];B[lm];W[kk];B[or]
(;W[mr]LB[nd:A]C[cooper:
IMPORTANT
--
this is only worth 6 points or so -- plus its gote for black to take the stone
s-- that means its an endgame move

a move at A is really big right now -- game winner];B[lg]C[cooper:  
this is a vague move... not good -- doesn't have a clear purpose]

cooper: 
this is an overplay -- i will show you how to punish

in the sequence .. you let play connect under to his stone at A -- the first t
hing to thick about when you want to kill a stone is seperating it from its fr
