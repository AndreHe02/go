AB[pd][dp]C[I've been playing a lot of Go on my iPhone lately with Igowin Pro (since I rarely get the time to play a full game online), which uses the Many Faces of Go engine and constantly adjusts its level to make each game as even as possible. This was one of my closer games -- I played white.

>>> looks like, but still I could not do better than you did. Black started with an advantage and is still ahead.]
;B[jd];W[mg]C[>>> I believe that going for the upper right corner is the best here. The top center black group is hard to attack.]
;B[dg];W[bc]C[>>> dangerous, see variation]
(;B[le];W[kg]C[>>> I cannot see the value of this move. Obviously, white can be cut with N14, O14, O13 or even worse: white can be forced to connect when blacksecures the corner.]
;B[fg];W[hf]C[>>> Even if white manages to separate the two black groups: black won't have trouble to make both live. White must fear being cut on several places now.]
;B[hh];W[bg]C[I don't know if it's an artifact of the software or my style, but a lot of my games start like this, with plenty of one space and knight jumps and almost no contact.

>>> You should play more often against humans, as computer players play really strange sometimes. If you have no time for online games on kgs you may want to play on www.dragongoserver.net which is turn based.]

(;W[fm]C[>>> black has escaped now. So white 33 is dubious. It certainly adds some support to the left side group but is definitely not necessary and gote. See variation]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[mf];W[nf];B[ng];W[nh];B[og];W[mh]C[>>> the result is not good for white. If black secures the corner with e.g. Q17 the three white stones are lost and black gets a huge corner territory. Also the white stones around L13 can be cut easily and will be target of attack.]
;B[gk]C[>>> A human would hardly make such an unimportant move when there are so many opportunities around.]
(;W[gl]C[>>> What is the intention of this move? See variation...]
;B[hm];W[go];B[jk];W[lj];B[ll];W[nj];B[nl]C[>>> just look again to this seuqence: black gained lots in terms of stability and influence, whereas white gains little (the white group is safe now but has  almost no points)]

;W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[lm]C[>>> white must be careful. A Move like N7 can easily be ignored by Black.  White is ahead, so it is very important to count carefully and secure territory.]
