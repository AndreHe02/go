C[Hallo!

I just lost this game badly. But I have a hard time figuring out what I did wrong and where the game changed to my disadvantage. So basically I may ask you to check through this game and look for the heavy mistakes. You don't need to see through the endgame or late middle game since the game went ill-advised from my side right from the beginning and was decided by then. In my opinion this game was lost after fuseki, but I wanna know where exactly and what instead I should have played.

Thx a lot in advance!

René

Hi :) 
Where are you from? France? My father is called René, but we are from Czechia.

There is one saying - noone ever resigned a game after fuseki. You can go out of it badly but there is always a nice chance to win. Problem is when you mess up in a corner and loose bunch of solid points. We will see what happens here :)]

;W[jd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[I don't think its possible to obtain a loosing position from perfect chinese opening... Actually here the opening is about to end.]
;W[qq]C[This move is unreasonable in any event. Your respons makes definately  superior position, hane on s4 is also possible and would be even better, since white has little he can do there.]

;B[nq]C[black lead is not as clear as it would be with r4.]

(;W[ec]
(;B[jm]C[This is wrong. Byt this move you say "I want the area on the right of it". But what about the left? Your influence stretches as far as the f3 stone and now you play like its not yours. Also it has no impact on the white position on the bottom left.]
;W[dj]C[W still needs a move at c14 first. This calls for an invasion.]

(;B[jj]C[The moyo may look large, but its still to open, I like the white's territory around the sides more. Two two-space jumps are no good - its a big weakness.]
;W[pj]C[This is too deep now, calls for a kill. The R9 stone is strong as it is and doesn't need a reinforcement, so q10 is nor forcing and B can attack immediately.

There are many posibilities for invasion and many require deep reading on how to exploit the weaknesss around k7. But the basic weaknes is q13, some combination like m11 pressing and then q13 should be enought.]

(;B[pk]C[Therefor this is wrong - you must see its overconcentrated.]
;W[nj]C[normally this is regarded as a very light shape, but here I would leave q10 as forcing and play even lighter, m10 for instance.]

(;B[ok]C[this looks nice, i just wouldn't like leting white to play r13 now. But I don't like giving up the right side - you have to have your mind on territory, since white has more if you don't count the o6 area, which is not yours yet.]

(;W[nh];B[me]C[good spirit];W[qc]C[You can play it any way you like, but keep sente and strong positon.]
;B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[ob]C[this is wrong. The o17 stone is not usefull for white anyway with n15 on its place, you dont need to capture it. Also with k16 you don't make any points. Moreover you make white play into the right side, helping his weak stones there in effect.]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[qf];W[pe];B[oe]C[Now the p14 cut gives white a much better prospect to make eyes with the o12 group.]
;W[qd];B[lc]C[ohohoh, what are you trying? To make 4 points? Where there is still a group to attack?]

(;W[ki]C[Looks fast, but it throws away too many points.]
(;B[jf]C[good direction, but too far from the group. better to prepare a little(The second variation)]
;W[ji]
(;B[he]C[Bad move - when you are this strong around, you can go for the deepest invasion possible, instead you go for a reduction. But the truth is that with e17 there isn't much space to do anything, which is why m17 is so bad.]

;W[mj];B[lj];W[li];B[kj]C[the black group is dead, white was just nice. I will end the comment here.
The main reason why you lost is quite obvious - you focused everything on building a single territory around o6 and therefor lost on the rest of the board. Another thing was the play on the top - making a very strong position where it couldn't be used. Thirdly were too soft on white, not making any invasion]
