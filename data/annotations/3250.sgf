AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Hi,man,
I am going to review the game for black side .
It seems white player is quit strong , 4d , not bad.
It must be a quite touch game for the black if I see
the rank difference between black and white:)]PL[W];W[dc];B[ce]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[cl];B[cm]LB[hq:A][cj:B][fn:C]C[we are told that movement such as B6 is 
always considered as a conservative action.

anyway as black gains the benefits from that 3 handicaps , indeed it is not a very worse stone:)

generally , we choose A or B or C];W[dl];B[ch]C[for the reason mention for B6 , 5,7 now become
a group of thick stones , so Black8 is relatively not bad];W[dr]
;B[cq];W[iq];B[fn];W[fl]
(;B[ed]C[Question: E16 was wrong, should be played at G17?
Yap , your feeling is good . But I don't prefer to say E16 is 'wrong' , there is no such judgement in the begining of the match :)]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[gc]C[from here , I think black has too much concern about safety. 

I would show you a better way (maybe)]
(;B[fc];W[fb];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[eh];W[hl]C[If I was white , I will throw a stone into the ocean in the right , 25 is too slow , it is not the way to win handicaps game . 

anyway , it is not black's business:)];B[nq];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[nd]MA[na][nb][nc]C[totally disagree on 28 and 30 , the door XXX
is open because W23 is very thick . so the territory 
of black corner is totally unstable .];W[qj];B[gp];W[gq];B[kq]
;W[fp];B[cr];W[qn];B[ql]LB[rp:A]C[Question:  I didn't know an other move in this situation than R8

If I was you , I choose A , to defend before start attacking . because 29,31 are in a nice condition ( not dangerous , black 38 is a bit too brave :)]

;B[fh];W[fi];B[ji];W[jk];B[bc]C[Question: too risky for the middle group because white can start an attack at any time against the whole group?

you black dragon in the middle is not in a risky at all
actually white is a bit dangerous in both side:)
remember that your dragon is always safe if all of your other dragons are safe :)]
