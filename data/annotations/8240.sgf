C[Hi Alex.

You requested that I review this game for both sides. I will make comments in this section and move your comments into [square brackets\] so that they are not confused with mine. I will try to go over the game in as much detail as I can, and if there is something you feel is inadequately explained, please feel free to email me for some more explanation.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce]
(;W[qf]TR[jc]C[This move can also be played at k17. I see that you can make a good formation on the right side with K4 if black doesn't pincer (and black should not pincer in this case), but I think the wedge is a better option for white.]
;B[nd]
(;W[rd]LB[lc:A]TR[pj]C[if you were concerned about black making a big moyo on the upper side, you should not have approached at r14 to begin with. playing m17 is not good, for reasons i will state in the variation.

In this situation, this move (r16) is playable. Q10 instead of r16 is also very interesting for white because it makes the Kobayashi formation, and white can try to make a moyo as big as black's. there is already a lot published on the internet about the kobayashi formation, so i suggest you look it up there instead of having me regurgitate pages upon pages of information.

[Is it good to play this pincer now ? I'm thinking of white M17 as a way to get into the upper edge before black strengthens but I was to afraid of N15 (variation A)\]]
;B[qc];W[pi]C[This move is not very good. If white wants to paly this point, white should just play it immediately. the slide (R16) does NOT take away the aji in the R14-Q11 extension. Instead, it only removes white's possibility of invading the corner. Remember that invading the corner is always bigger than sliding into the corner. Sliding into the corner should be used when you want to make a base for yourself.]
;B[jc];W[jq]C[Good question.
C10 (or D10) is a big point on the verge of two competing moyos. If white plays it, white will enlarge his moyo. if black plays it, black will enlarge his moyo. This is why I think D10 is better than K3. Also, D10 is better than C10 because C10 is low. the C4 stone is already low, and playing C10 makes the left side too low.

[Is C10 (or around) better for white to stop black building a strong moyo with the next move ?\]]
;B[dj];W[jj]TR[je][ep][op]C[This move is not as big as it looks. It is not very big if black gets it either. White should consider making an enclosure at E4 or P4 (very big), or maybe a reducing move at k15


[I was very happy with this move to approach the black's moyo, make my own and prevent future ladder problems. Is it exagerate ?\]]

playing the kosumi is okay too.]
