C[I played as white in this game.

Comments: Andre Bergholz (3K), marked with AB.];B[pd];W[dc]
;B[pq];W[cp];B[qi]LB[qj:a]C[AB: Normally at R10.];W[po];B[qo]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[nc]C[Should have extended to R9?

AB: Yes, absolutely. That was the only move. In a professional game, O17 would be the losing move.]
;B[nd]LB[ql:a]C[AB: Should attack right away wiht R8.];W[md]
;B[ne];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb]LB[ql:a]
C[AB: Small. Excellent opportunity to play R8.];W[me]LB[qk:a]
C[AB: Still R9. Even something like C15 seems more interesting. But R9 is essential.]
;B[ep]LB[ql:a]C[AB: Unbelievable :-). Let me elaborate on the virtues of R8/9. If White plays R9, then his group is 99% alive with one move. And that in an area, where Black has already invested many stones. No more worries. That means the big Black investment has lost a significant part of its value. On the other hand, if Black gets the opportunity to attack at R8, White will be in severe trouble and Black can make use of his stones as he can cut and attack at will and virtually doesn't need to worry about his stones, because of all the nearby support. Difference like day and night. On top of that, the kakari is more urgent in the upper left. It splits White in the middle and the lower side is not so inteesting, because of the low position of O3.]

(;W[eq]C[I thought about pincering. But from other games I played I found it's not good for me to pincer in situations where there is a stone like O3 to help black.

AB: I would suggest the joseki D6. See variation. The left side is more interesting than the bottom.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[I do not like this result. The extension is well-balanced along the bottom.

AB: The result is not bad. An invasion at M3 is still possible.]
;W[de]LB[qk:a]C[AB: Big, but not nearly as important as R9.]
;B[ql]C[AB: Now we can say the game is good for Black.]
(;W[pk]C[Is there was to settle the Q6 group? I was looking for an exchange. It doesn't seem like Q9 was good. Would R9 help me settle the group? In this situation I don't mind settling small and giving black thickness. I think theoretically jumping out is best.

AB: Let me first reemphasize that you are in trouble now :-). There may be a little aji around R9, but it's best to jump out now. If you look on the board you see that the three White stones are surrounded on almost all sides by Black. The only direction where there is a little room to breathe is towards N6. See variation. Q9 is very bad, on the other hand. If I was Black I would be desperately looking to start a fight here. Q9 is the perfect opportunity for Black to cut and fight.]
;B[pl];W[ol]C[The start of an ugly fight.

AB: Well, let me reemphasize that Black loves to fight here. It's like you are alone at night in the Bronx and you encounter 15 tall shady people. Do you
a) pick a fight?
b) run?
Sometimes, common sense helps in go, too :-).];B[ok];W[oj]C[AB: Not a good idea to create a new weak group. And it hurts your original group at Q6 on top of that.]
;B[nk]TR[oj]C[AB: The addition of the two marked stones was good for who? For Black, of course. Hence your position got worse.]
;W[pi];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj]C[AB: Soft. R12 was easily possible. Maybe Q12, but there are risks.]
;W[mm]C[AB: Good. Finally we get back to our original goal.]
;B[nj];W[ph];B[qg];W[ni];B[mi];W[pg];B[qf];W[mj];B[mk]LB[nh:a]
C[AB: Could atari first. But it's not sure that that is better.]

;W[jj];B[jk];W[ij];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg];W[lh];B[lg];W[kg];B[kf]
;W[jg];B[le];W[ld];B[kd]C[I'm being stubborn and I probably should've resigned or play L17 if I continue. There is a lot of open space left on the board and I thought I could kill something. I kill a lot in my games.

AB: The game is clearly won for Black. There are two causes: First, the importance of R8/9. Second, the creation of the new weak group around Q10. You see now that Q10 is dead and your original group around Q6 is still in hardly any better situation than before. When you are in your opponent's sphere of influence you run, make shape, and are flexible. To get at least something, a compromise. The attitude "I kill a lot in my games" doesn't help. Here, Black had no isks whatsoever. You fight when you think a fight gives you an advantage. Here, a fight is only in the interest of Black.]
;W[lp];B[kc]LB[lq:a]C[AB: Black should probably answer. All his stones are connected then.]
;W[kb];B[lc];W[jb];B[lb];W[la];B[mc];W[lr]C[AB: The top was big, but Black is taking a risk. Now The situation at the bottom has changed. White's group is more or less out of trouble.]
;B[jm];W[or];B[nr]C[AB: P3 seems better.];W[oq];B[op];W[pp]
;B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[rq]C[AB: Bad. Black needed to sacrifice by playing atari at R2, then S2 and alive. See variation.]
;W[qr];B[os];W[rr]C[AB: Now it is Black who needs to look for eyes. That was unnecessary.]
;B[rp];W[sq];B[kq];W[lq];B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[ln];B[nm];W[nn]
;B[no];W[on];B[mp];W[jn]LB[nl:a]C[AB: O8 is really big.];B[im]
;W[in];B[ho];W[ik];B[om]C[AB: Big. Now Black's O9 group is out of trouble. That means that Q10 is dead for sure now. Furthermore, the White M5 group is cut off and can be attacked.]
;W[hm]C[AB: Good.];B[kr];W[dj];B[cg]C[AB: Good again. Black just needs to live here.]
;W[ce];B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[bl];B[eg]LB[ci:a]C[AB: Seems a little loose. Is there not a possibility to attack severely now? I would have played C11.]
;W[dh];B[dg]
(;W[fe]LB[bi:a]C[AB: I think with B11 instead you can create trouble. Which is obviously in your interest as you are behind.]
;B[ci]C[AB: Good.];W[bh];B[ch];W[di]TR[bh]C[AB: It may be better to save the stone at the bottom. Black will have more difficulties to make eyes.]
;B[bf];W[be];B[ae];W[gg]LB[hc:a]C[AB: Not so good. With H17 you make an attempt to save the situation at the top.]
;B[hc]C[AB: Very good. Actually, is Black really alive on the left?]
;W[fn]C[Would F7 or E7 be better?

AB: Not much difference. The territory can be reduced by Black anyways.]
;B[gh]C[AB: See variation.];W[hg]C[We both ran into 15 sec. byo-yomi here. The initial time was 20 minutes. It seemed too short for both of us.

AB: Ah, yes, that is short. I guess this game qualifies as typical "internet-style".]
;B[eh];W[fj];B[gj]LB[fi:a]C[AB: This seems like an overplay. White can F11, then cut G11.]
;W[is]C[AB: Oops. Typo?];B[ks]C[I regretted it right after I played it.

AB: You should :-).];W[hr];B[fr];W[go];B[hn]LB[hq:a]C[AB: Black should just play H3.]
;W[gp];B[kl];W[ls];B[io];W[kp];B[iq];W[jl];B[il];W[hl];B[jl]
;W[jr];B[jq]LB[ir:a]C[AB: J2 seems better.];W[jo]LB[hq:a]C[AB: Would H3 not be better?]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[ip];W[gq]
(;B[gr]
(;W[ir]C[That is the byo-yomi effect and the losing move.

AB: Ah. this is the losing move :-). You were lucky to be given the opportunity to turn the game around. But this is not go, this is lottery.]

AB: You should learn when to pick a fight. Start a fight in your sphere of influence. Otherwise don't. It's not all attack. It's a balance between attack and defense. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me (begholz@gmail.com). Good luck!]
