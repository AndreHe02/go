C[
I am Tenshi.  During this game, I was white.   Then, most of my questions will focus on attacking because that is my super weakness right now.   During this game, my questions may be too picky, but I really hope you can give me some advice about the questions and the whole game.   Thank you.
Reviewer: hellow! I am a go-lover with 3 stone handycup to the professional go player. now, I want to do my best for this game.]

Reviewer:In this situation I will lay K17  (*) position, however I could't evaluate the best position.]

R:14 is one of a set of movements, but in this situation, A is a vital point in relation to O3.
3 stones (8,10 and12) are living, even in any attack.];B[jq]

How can I handle this situation? I think G5 is ok.... but after serveral moves, black Jumped K5 in the 19th move. I was confused how can I enhance my group G3 by attacking black group F5 and I would not hurt my O3????
R: In this situation, first you must think that G5 and  O3, both stones, are in difficut situations,  so you should think one stone must discard. so, i will lay k5(*) position, If black's answer were L4 or M4(X) direction, 16 is the best move. However, if H4 or J4 (+) direction were selected,  A would be the best move.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[ho];B[jo]C[
I think F6 is a weak point, but black Jumped K5 instead of protecting F6.  Is there any way to use that weak point??? or I just need to play J6 and wait for black's response to K6 or F6??   or do you any good sequence for this situation??
R:Now, white stones became three, to discard is something  difficult. As you mentioned, J6 (a sample move shown in branch)
Such moves are much  better (especially J6).]

The fighting is lost for sure now????
R:In stead of 26, you should choose J7,
then you could capture black stones..];B[gl]C[

44 is bad move. If the defeat is clear, then don't move, otherwise you lost ko-move.]

Black are strong in surrounding area. Therefore,J17, J16, K16 or L16 (*) positions are better.]

I think the black move is not good locally, but because black was leading a lot, taking the profits for black maybe a good strategy??]
;W[lc]C[
1. Because I wanted to prevent black to get the upper side profits, I decide to cut, but the result seemed not too good for me.  2. Or without thinking about black's leading, the proper for white is play O16 instead of M17?
3. or do you have any suggestion?];B[ld];W[nc];B[nd];W[mb];B[me]

Instead 80 white must connectd at N17 (*).];B[mc];W[gm];B[hm]

This move was played by the time pressure.   I was thinking about how to attack group p3 to enhance my group p8+p6.  Then, try to figure out how to attack P11.         So, do you have any suggestion to enhance my group p8+p6 before attacking p11??]

IF white N14 instead of 98, the result is shown in next branch.]

(;W[oh]
(;B[ni]TR[mc]C[
If white adopt N14 instead 100, the result is shown in next branch.
As N17 (*) point is ko, in this situattion, white seemed to have no chance.]

(;W[nh];B[mf]C[
I was thinking when to play N14 for attacking group p15, but at this time, black played N14, and I lost this chance.......
Do you have any suggestion when will be a good time for me(white) to play N14 before black took this N14? or there is no chance  for me to play N14  during this game?]
;W[mi];B[nk]C[
From the 103th move to 153th move, do you have the better way to attack black group (o9+o11) group?
And can you also show me which moves are not good not only in the black sides, but  also white side?
Eventually, I was lost by time, but I think I couldn't kill the black group.^_^
I know my questions are too harsh, but I really need your help.
