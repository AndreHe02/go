C[Thanks for reviewing my game!
R端diger: You are welcome! My first comment will be at move 7.]

(;B[dr]C[Your move is not outright wrong, but the "old school" is to make a extension to the right side first, lets say to J3 or J4.

Normal play continues up to move 13.];W[jp];B[cq];W[nq];B[qn]
;W[nn]
(;B[ch]TR[dm][dp]C[I think this is the first move to criticise.

The space for the black stone is too narrow. To form a solid base it will need C9, C15 is not good to form a base, as it is too near to D16.

Old school is to play in the biggest move, which in this phase of the game is where the biggest space is. Any of the variations I show is better in my mind.

If black wants to attack the white stones marked with a triangle a move at C9 would be better.]
;W[cj]C[The black stone is now in immediate trouble, having to look for life, which gives white the initiative for the next few moves.]
;B[ce]C[This move is not a good extension, as it is to near to the white stone.]
;W[gc]C[But white misses the change to press on the black stone.]
;B[pj]LB[pk:A][qk:B][pl:C]C[From the perspective of your lower stones this move is too far. A, B or C are more solid. Also you stones in the left side are not yet settled.]
;W[pl];B[qg]LB[pr:A]C[Imagine a white move at Q2? You now have 2 unsettled groups, my feelings for black are uncomfortable...]
;W[pn]C[White misses his chances...]
(;B[po]C[Two GO proverbs:

1 - when attached then extend
2 - dont bang your head

a better move in regard to 1 is R5, see the variation];W[on]
;B[jd]TR[ce][ch]SQ[qn][po][pp]C[The move is not bad, but ... your stones "Triangle" *and* "Square" are not yet settled...]

LB[pb:A][ic:1][mf:B][of:C]TR[nc][ne][lf]SQ[lc][jd][jf]C[The question is: Who is hunting whom?

Square: has no base nor eyes yet. it could make a small base with "1"
Triangle, yould make a base and eyes at A, but has a cutting point around B
Circle: is only loosely connected, not really strong either...having a weak point at C]
;B[jh];W[of]C[White spots the black weak point...];B[pf];W[og]
;B[ph]C[Good - black has got some territory and lost a stone]
;W[oh]LB[lc:B][jd:B][ce:A][jf:B][ch:A][jh:B][qn:C][po:C][pp:C]
C[White is eager to keep this stone, black should use the braething brake to settle one of his unsettled groups A, B or C...]
;B[oi]C[Not really necessary...];W[pb]C[Now whites center group has 2 certain eyes and can fight strongly...]
;B[qc];W[mb];B[lb]
(;W[ni]C[Whites move is an error, imagine white J18.];B[nj]
;W[mi]C[Hm, I hear myself repeating, black should now settle one of his groups...]

(;B[ei]C[hm, this is not really an enforcing move...see my variations]
;W[cc];B[pr]C[Good, this groups feels better now];W[nr];B[de]
C[this one too, also the center group now looks better

but white has got some territory on the top and bottom];W[ek]
C[White prepares some center territory];B[ge]C[blacks area is open at E14 and H11]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[bd];B[be]C[Whites territory gain is bigger];W[cp]
;B[qb];W[pc]
(;B[iq]C[is a clamp @ P18 a possibility here?

R端diger: Hm, the question even does not come up to my mind,,,See the variation, but it will not bring any serious danger to whites group, J3 is certainly better in the sense of territory]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[fo]C[now black should do something against the starting white center moyo]
;B[gp]C[Well this move helps white more than disturbing him...]
;W[go];B[ho];W[hp];B[ip];W[fp];B[gq];W[dq]C[But white plays small moves too...]
;B[cr];W[hn];B[io];W[jo];B[in];W[hm]TR[hi]C[white did not take his chance...black should now defend at H11]
;B[im];W[ln];B[ql];W[ok];B[oj];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm]LB[rl:B][rn:A]

;B[mk]CR[jh][ij][im][lm]C[I feel like I should have tried to take  more territory in this area.

R端diger: Well I dont see much space here, but H11, would have been a territory of 24 points.]

;W[hg];B[hf];W[ji];B[bp]C[Good, white missed this move when fiddling around in the center]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]LB[ob:C][hc:D][ed:B][bi:A][np:E]C[whites move is unnecessary...but the game is nearly finished. 

I see black moves with regard to territory at A-E];B[bi];W[od]

;W[tt]C[I thought I played relatively well; although there were a few points at which I felt like I was following too much.  any overall comments are appreciated.  Thanks again!

R端diger: From the strategic point, the early move on the left side was your main burden. White did not take to much of gain from this error.

The hanging connection at A12 brought you some trouble and the loss of many points. The fight for 3 or 4 points in the center brought to you the loss of more points in the top.

I hope my comments help you. Have a nice day.];B[tt]TW[aa][ba]
