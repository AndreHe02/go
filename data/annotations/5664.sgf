C[Hello,

I will do my best to help you in this, have fun!


departure play in kgs, Me katmandu (white 1k*). Be about playing sanrensei correctly but equal lost for 5.5 points.

Please help in the errors.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[fq]C[This is not a real sanrensei game, if black wants to play sanrensei he should play Q10 now]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qn];B[pj]C[A rather far away pincer...]
;W[qq]C[This is fine];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
(;B[rn]C[This is a strange move, it leaves too much aji, better to just connect]
;W[nq];B[np]C[This is a bad move, it takes away all the aji, better to wait with something like this]

(;W[mq]C[Katmandu: correct?

Ball: Off course, not responding here would give black way too much! See variation]
;B[mp];W[nc]C[Katmandu: tenuki is correct?

Yes, black can not do much on the bottom, playing the top is big]
;B[qf]
(;W[pb]C[Possible, but it is easier to play against a big moyo by building yourself, see variation]
;B[lq]
(;W[lr]C[good, you can not let black descend here];B[oq];W[or]
;B[kr]
(;W[kq]C[Better to just cover, leaves some more opportunities]
;B[lp];W[mr];B[jr]
(;W[kc]C[This is not so big now, as you can always play R17 anyways, playing in the top left or in the right cornet would be bigger]
;B[qc];W[df]C[Good]
(;B[ne]C[Strange move, black can play more forcefully]
(;W[jj]C[Interesting move, but I would prefer a little deeper, as black can not attack you easily, see variation. But the idea is very nice, invading is not easy and not good, so good idea!]
;B[lj];W[jl];B[ll];W[jh];B[lh]C[If played as in the variation, black would have about 10-15 points less, but still white looks to having an easy game here as black has no stones at all at the left]
;W[ec]C[Kat: correct or best d10 or other move?

No this is fine, it makes it hard for B to go in];B[ch]
(;W[bg]C[This is not so good, as B can make a base easily, see variation]
;B[ck]
(;W[cr]C[Too soft, need to attack black]
(;B[eq]C[Not good at all from black! He has to take care of his group!]
;W[bh]C[Good, but lucky that you get it at all];B[bi]C[Strange move from black, he can not do much here]
;W[dj]C[Kat: good atack or not?


This is a good move, it will be hard for black to make eyes, see variations for black]

(;B[cj];W[di];B[ci];W[el];B[bm]
(;W[cm];B[bn];W[bo];B[cl];W[an];B[al]C[now w has a cutting point at C5, so hard to attack... maybe best here to let B live, see variation]

(;W[bk];B[dm];W[dn];B[ek]
(;W[dk]C[This is too much, see variation];B[dl];W[fl];B[dh]
;W[fj];B[eh];W[fi]C[Now black moves out into you territory, so you have to kill, which is never easy]
;B[em];W[fo];B[fm];W[gl];B[ef]
(;W[ee]C[Kat: bad move?

Yes, as B can take the B14 stones, which you can not lose here]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[cg];W[bl];B[gg];W[ff]C[good!];B[fh]
;W[hf]C[also good, making points while attacking];B[hg];W[if]
;B[gm];W[jn];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[il];B[hm];W[hj];B[ho]C[Ok, so the attack is over as black connected, lets see how the score is:

Black right: About 70-75 pts
Black bottom: 10-15
Black total: 80-90 points

White bottom left: 15-20 pts
White top: 50 points
W centre + komi: 10 points
Bottom right: 10 points
Total w: about 75-85 points

and white to move, so the game has become close, now w needs to get a good endgame]

;W[ip];B[jo];W[jp];B[ko]
(;W[hr]C[Kat: ok or best h3?

This only costs 1 points, so you can play H3, but better just tenuki]
;B[hq];W[go]C[Why play here? Black can not cut you anyways, this costs a move, better play R18...]

This is probably bigger than playing O13, but hard to say...]
