C[Hi, Thank you for reviewing my game. The opening was fairly balanced, but I got lost in the middle game and made a mess before finally resigning. I'm not particularly strong at any stage of the game, so any and all comments will be appreciated. Thanks!

-----

Interesting game... thanks. I don't think there were any themes for mistakes in this game for W, rather it just seemed like there were several points where a move was ineffective or led to a poor result. I've tried to highlight moves where both players could have made a better decision.]

(;B[pf];W[nd];B[qd];W[qc];B[qe];W[rc];B[qi];W[dc];B[jc]C[Good thought, but I'd prob go a little closer to the upper right group.

WIth K17, W gets to build upper right group while putting pressure on new B stone.]

(;W[gc];B[mc];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob];B[mb];W[md]C[At first I thought this was slow but now I like it =/]
;B[je];W[mg]C[I was trying to keep some pressure on the upper black group while also preparing to approach on the bottom

------------------

Not sure this move is so effective. Upper B/W group seems pretty strong to me. Approaching bottom sounds better.]
;B[cj];W[fq]C[i wasn't sure the best place to start on the bottom, but this seemed as good as any

---

Yep];B[eq]C[Weak response even with C10. I'd go w/ something normal like D6 or something fun like H3.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[nq]C[i was planning to play k4 if black q6. if black played in the middle, like k3, then I would try to get some thickness on the right side and try to surround the lower middle area. that's how things played out, but i'm not sure it was a good decision.

-----

Yea this is "ok" - actually in a lot of handicap games, W will play this in an effort to play 'fast'. So if a high dan plays it in their handicap games, it should be fine.

I think this leads to complications though so in an even game I'll usually take the safer route w/ something like k4.]

C[the next few moves from here played out as I expected. i had hoped that would make me strong enough to start poking around again at some of black's weaker groups elsewhere on the board, but it didn't work.

---

Yea it's a decent sequence.];B[er];W[ep];B[dq];W[do];B[co];W[di]
C[i had no idea where to go now. There aren't really any big territorial points now and i'm a little behind, so I was trying to prevent black from growing.

---

Yea, looks like W is slightly behind, and there are no spots that jump out, since pretty much every group is stable. Only B's R13 group could be considered weakish.

I think a lot of moves could be fine here, including the one you played. I'd also consider something like R9 or P8.]

(;B[dc]C[Normal is to approach a non 4-4 (or 3-3) stone first, but probably a minor point. The reasoning is that 4-4/3-3 points are 'stable', and the next move is not urgent. However 3-5 points are more urgent because it is worth a lot to complete the enclosure.]
