C[Hello, I am Bernd, HonFu in the ladder and on KGS.

In your game you profited from the strange decisions of your opponent, but you missed several opportunities to attack. Igo means "surrounding game". You should try to surround and kill weak stones, when there is an opportunity!

In this review I will show you where and how.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[qo];W[jd];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]
;W[eg];B[id]C[This is a strange move. Absolutely unnatural. Why is it so important to start such a desperate maneuver already now?]

(;W[ic]C[Mistake!

You have a wall, and a wall is made to crush your opponent's weak stones at, not for making a few points on the 3rd line.

Do not make points with walls, use them to attack!]
(;B[hd];W[je];B[hf]
(;W[hc]C[Consequent, but wrong.];B[gd];W[gc];B[jq]C[Since he asks you so nicely, you should hunt his weak group now.]

(;W[qj];B[qf]
(;W[pf]C[Mistake!];B[pe]
(;W[qd]C[Not good.];B[qe];W[od];B[pg]C[He is building up thickness. You get no attack, instead R10 becomes a weak group. The points at the top are not that much.]
;W[qm];B[me];W[md];B[ne];W[nd]
(;B[pj]C[This is strange. You got a weak group. Normally he should not touch it (making you stronger) but looking for a move that endangers the life of the group. Although there is a touching sequence that might work for him (see first variation).]
;W[pk];B[qi];W[qk];B[pi];W[nk];B[ok]C[This is bad from his side. He helps you, and you use it well.]
;W[ol];B[oj];W[nm];B[jj]C[This move makes no sense. He can not hope to attack your group, which shape is already too strong. He is not building up a moyo with his tengen stone. It has no connection to his weak group at the top, and also not to the upper right or lower side. It just hangs in midair doing nothing but to be potentially weak. You probably saw, how this helped you in your game.]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[hh];W[ii];B[hi];W[ij]C[I like your idea. Black is still under attack, and the tengen stone is already worthless]
;B[hj]C[Now the question is, what you want to accomplish? 

Do you want to kill the one stone which is already "bubblegum at a wall", or do you want to go on attacking the large group in the upper left and press it to your wall?

I think, the answer is clear.]
(;W[jk]
(;B[kj];W[hk];B[gk]
(;W[kk];B[lj];W[nj];B[ni];W[mi];B[mj];W[nh];B[oi]C[This only works, because he believes you that his stones are so valuable.]
;W[mk];B[mh];W[li];B[lh];W[ki];B[kh];W[ji]C[He's just cementing your security while achieving nothing. Thank you, black!]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[df];W[ef];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[fb];B[ee]
(;W[ej];B[ek]
(;W[fj];B[gj]C[The moves you play here are bad style. You take your own liberties and surround yourself.]
;W[fk];B[fl]TR[ej][fj][fk]C[Do you see how your three stones are on the inside of his? Do not surround yourself, surround him!]
;W[el];B[dk];W[gl];B[fm];W[dj];B[hl];W[dl];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm]
;W[em];B[en];W[ck]C[This was somewhat easy for him. You lived, but you are also surrounded, and instead of being in trouble with his weak group, he was able to escape and build up his moyo.]

(;B[gm];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr];W[hq]
(;B[hr]C[Nice of him to give you life.];W[ir];B[gr];W[iq];B[gq]
;W[gp];B[fq];W[ep];B[fp];W[do];B[cp];W[eo];B[dn];W[co];B[er]
;W[bm];B[fo];W[cn];B[fn];W[jp];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp]C[Good. Just give him what he wants, it won't be enough. You have robbed him a great deal of points.]
;B[mq];W[in];B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[ip];B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[nn]
;B[oo];W[il]C[This game is won now, so my comment ends.

Both of you were missing opportunities to attack (surround) the other, and by that wasting a lot of potential. Probably you now see, how important surrounding is. If you want to know more about it, here are some good reads for you:

Still, the move in the game is not good.]))
(;W[qe]C[This is the move!

With the move in the game you try to build territory with your wall at K16. But that is the wrong strategy, because it will always be not enough and overconcentrated. You should hunt the opponent towards your strength, as told before. This move does that and ...]
;B[pf];W[nd];B[qh];W[oi]C[... again you have the situation that you build up the top side and the center while compressing him to a small, worthless group.]

(;W[hh];B[ig];W[ji];B[kg];W[lh]C[You will hunt him across the board and build up influence in the center as well as territory at the top. He gets nothing. Best result he will have, if you do it right, is just the minimal eyespace.]

Whatever he will do, he will only have a tiny life, while you build up influence. 

Remember this: Push the opponent towards your strength and surround him!]
