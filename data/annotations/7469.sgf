C[Trilark [5k\]: hi gg
kappa [6k\]: hello; enjoy

GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, though White here is likely to make plays way over my head :)
I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf.];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[fd];W[df];B[ch]
(;W[hd]TR[eg]C[Trilark [5k\]: Well here black played something unexpected, I didn't knew any joseki beginning like this, looking at kogo's joseki dictionary I found two following. That might have been better

GP: Because C12 is low, this is a common trick overplay in handicap games, when the F16 approach is at F17. Black's hoping to get a passive White who can then be sealed into the corner, and as a result, White's correct response is almost always to split. My choice would be E13 as the most logical split instead of pincering.]
;B[cc];W[dc]C[GP: The correct side.];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb]
;B[da];W[ea];B[bb];W[ec]C[GP: F17 has slightly less aji globally because of the situation on the top. This actually made an important difference later on.]
;B[be];W[bf]C[Trilark [5k\]: I konow the shape is ugly but I wanted to give him  only a small corner

GP: Not at all, the shape is excellent, he's made a very small push in gote, and fully isolated (for the time being) the C12 stone - this is an excellent result for White.]
;B[bd];W[cj]TR[pd][dp]C[GP: This is a bit close - your thickness can speak for itself. I would be tempted to play in one of the remaining two corners as they are huge.]
;B[bg];W[af];B[ae];W[cg]C[GP: This is the first really bad move. Black has nothing he can do that hurts if you don't play this move, and he's ended up with another very small sequence in gote. You are better off playing elsewhere - again, those two remaining corners are very big moves.]
;B[ag];W[cf];B[bi];W[dh];B[ci];W[di]C[GP: This is really good. Sealing in here is definitely the right approach, White is building up an invincible lead.]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[cm]C[Trilark [5k\]: well here I thought that for a few points I won a big influence

GP: Yes, the game is effectively over now, it should not be possible for Black to win from here.]
;B[ah];W[bm]TR[pd][dp]C[Trilark [5k\]: now this looks really slow to me

GP: D4 or Q16 still much bigger. This is slow, but it's still not terrible.]
;B[dp];W[fq]C[GP: Good! Push Black into your thickness.];B[dn]
;W[co]TR[fo][jp][cq][iq][dr]C[GP: No need to peep. You can play D2 or C3 to remove eyespace here and keep Black on the run. Or, just ignore and jump along the bottom edge to J3 or K4. The thickness will do its work automatically as long as you keep Black weak. F5 is also a sensible option.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[bo]
(;W[bn]TR[eo]C[GP: E5 is an amost forced shape move here. Black will be in terrible trouble if that separation is maintained. White should not allow Black a tactical chance to push out into the middle.]
;B[eo];W[cn];B[fp]C[GP: A nice recovery by Black. That block at B6 was very costly.]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[gq];B[ao]TR[pd][qd][np][nq]C[GP: Another nonsense move by Black! Take the last corner or approach the bottom right. Locally, B3 is playable if you want to remove eyespace, so moves around H5 are sensible to make it hard for Black to run - as a result, an approach to the bottom right would be intended to work with a following H5. If Black plays elsewhere, wB3 permanently destabilises the Black group, at which point you can use the thickness for profit (see following variation).]

(;W[en]C[GP: This cut here is very small. The loss from Black pushing and gaining on the outside is much greater than the capture of that single ston. With your thickness, letting Black save that stone is not costly for White. If you really want to play locally make your framework intimidating that Black has to invade unreasonably. A play at G7 would make more local sense.]
;B[fn];W[em];B[fm];W[pd]C[GP: Good!];B[nd];W[pf];B[jd];W[hf]
;B[hc];W[ld]C[Trilark [5k\]: well this move might be too optimistic isn't it?

GP: The move is ok. H17 is a relatively big move to respond to, but without E17 having been at F17 it is hard to make a convincing local response. As a result, this offers a reasonable return I think.]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[kd];W[mc];B[lb];W[md]C[GP: Good! This is a very nice result for White.]
;B[mb];W[ic]C[GP: You were possibly fortunate here. I think O17 must be played immediately (see variation on the next move)]

(;B[jc];W[id];B[ib];W[hb];B[kb]C[GP: Very lucky that Black did not play O17 here!]
;W[nc]C[GP: Still, this is the key point, and an excellent move. Another good result for White. White is strongly ahead at this point.]
;B[pa];W[qn]C[GP: Good tenuki, the monkey jump was too early.]
;B[pl];W[on]C[GP: Good.];B[oo];W[nn];B[mp];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq]
C[GP: This is a bit small, but White's position here is now excellent.]
;B[rr]
(;W[pj]TR[pi][ok][lo]C[GP: White's group is not yet alive. This move is going to threaten your own group and give Black a chance to fight back. Either lean on top influentially (perhaps P9) or attack from a distance with a move such as Q11 that doesn't leave Black the opportunity to pincer back. Alternatively, push on the lower side first to settle the group further before attacking (see variation).]
;B[nl];W[ln];B[ph];W[nj];B[nh];W[lj];B[qj]C[Trilark [5k\]: always this cheaty connection by under :-(

GP: True, but you had a few loose 4th line stones, which aren't territory anyway - expecting Black to get nothing here is optimistic. In this position, the kill really isn't vital, it is better to find a way of exploiting his moves to give you some profit in return.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[qi];B[oj];W[pi];B[oi]
(;W[og]C[GP: If you play R12 the result is quite acceptable for White. The monkey jump at the top right is now very painful for White, as Black can really separate strongly, and eyespace becomes key. Attacking here is unreasonable as White can keep the lead more safely and simply, and the cost could be great if this goes wrong. This move probably cost you in the region of 30 points.]
;B[qh]C[GP: Ouch, Black gets to press before defending - P13 is badly misplaced now.]

(;W[rj]C[GP: Extend so the squeeze isn't possible.];B[ri];W[qj]
;B[oh];W[ql];B[rg];W[re];B[ng];W[kq]C[GP: Very big, but the top right is now critical. bR17 looks painful to say the least. Black's group is also not settled fully - tenuki here is a) dangerous, and b) not exploiting the weaknesses black has.]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[ej];W[ek];B[el]
(;W[dm]C[GP: Play F9. Even if Black captures White can ignore, and F9 in itself is worth more than the 6 points that exchanged hands (see variation).]
;B[fk];W[dk];B[fi]C[GP: Black has now virtually destroyed the influence White had created. It is not at all clear who is now winning. Black has 20 points on the left, and probably another 12 in the bottom right. Even with only 8 points elsewhere that's 40 points or so, that White doesn't seem to have.]
;W[dj]C[Trilark [5k\]: well here all my influence was useless I would like to see how I could have used better

GP: Essentially, you valued the stones around this area too highly. The cut at E6 and the capture at D7 ended up netting you 2 points, but at the cost of virtually the entire wall of influence.]
;B[jg];W[ll]C[GP: Good.];B[of]
(;W[pg]C[GP: Unless you are trying to kill the whole group, simply trade (see variation) - you don't need to save a stone just because it's in atari.]
;B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[nf];B[mf];W[oc];B[me];W[le]C[GP: None of this pushing makes sense unless you have a kill lined up. You gain nothing, black gains nothing. There is far more to be gained settling this group once and for all, then looking for big points such as C2, or strongly double sente points such as R4.]

;B[jb];W[fg]
(;B[nb];W[pb];B[ob];W[pc];B[qb];W[qc]C[GP: S17 for eyeshape.]
;B[rb];W[rc]C[Trilark [5k\]: I know here I'm lucky because my opponent missed the kill]

(;B[sb];W[rf];B[lh];W[qg];B[hg];W[gf];B[gg];W[ff];B[fh];W[gl]
;B[fl];W[nk];B[ok];W[ml];B[jk];W[jj];B[ij]
(;W[ik]C[GP: Now Black can use the influence to handle your attacks. By continually building the central walls he tempts you to come in too deep, then cuts your head off :)

White could peep locally at J8 as an alternative to diving in in this way (see variation).]
;B[il];W[hk];B[jl];W[gm];B[hn];W[ji];B[ii];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq]
;B[gp];W[cr]C[GP: Very big :)

I think B3 is probably bigger though, as it either follows bB4 wC3, or bC3 wB4, both of which seem preferable to this line.]
;B[br];W[bq];B[cq];W[ar];B[dr];W[bs];B[dq];W[er];B[bp];W[ds]
;B[io];W[jo];B[jn];W[kn];B[jm];W[lr]C[GP: L2 may be better as it is does not finish in gote. Also, R4 is the better side to start as this is strongly sente for each side.]

kappa [6k\]: thanks
kappa [6k\]: bye
Trilark [5k\]: so for me this +4,5 are really bad and the defeat was so near because my oponent missed to kill one of my groups. Could you help me to improve?

GP: Actually, I'm afraid that you really lost the game anyway. However, your yose was really very good indeed, and you pulled it back to win quite stylishly :)

*** Important points to take from the game ***

* You played fantastically well early on the left hand side. Black's direction of play was really quite poor, but you developed a really strong thick position very skilfully.
* When you are playing a thickness orientated game, it won't become points by itself. Obviously you learn that making territory directly isn't the way to do it, but you can't just hope it will happen anyway. You need to make it happen by forcing your opponent's hand - making it look like you have decided to claim the whole top side of the board (such as a big move in the top right corner earlier on, as in one of the variations) would make sure the opponent had to charge headlong into that side (and, indirectly, your big thick wall) - that's when you make the thickness count.
* Once the big fight started on the right, your drive seemed to be to steal eyes and kill the black group, without much regards to the position on the board. Instead of killing Black, you ended up making two groups into two really quite weak groups instead of one strong connected group with a decent territorial profit - something possible when Black attempted to connect underneath. Counting is very important, and making sure your groups are settled and strong _before_ trying to kill is equally so - that way your strategy can suit the game.
* Your yose was really good :)

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]

(;W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[of];W[pe]TR[ql][kq]C[GP: White's just got as many points on the right as Black has on the whole of the left. Black has no points at the top, which means it's what's left of the left middle and bottom that will dictate the game. It is very hard to see how Black can catch up, even with his overplaying ways!

The triangled plays are both remaining huge plays. If White can take both of these, the game is over.]

(;W[np];B[pn];W[ho];B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[bq];B[fm];W[gk]C[GP: Now White can severely attack the whole black group, all the while profiting on the top...]
;B[hm];W[ik];B[jm];W[pd]C[GP: Now White tempts black to invade - with the thickness it is very hard for Black to get a good result at the top, compared to the points White may be given. This is the way to use thickness - get strong, then create a loose position that invites an invasion. It is profiting from the weakness of that invasion that will turn the thickness into points.]

[fd][gd][dj][dk][ek][dl][el][dm][em][dn][en]C[GP: Something like this is a terrible result for Black, White's wall now attacks half the board, and Black has maybe 20 points to show for it if the corner goes well. To add to the example, all of Black's points on the left equate to the triangled area, and that's not taking into account the vast amount of thickness that can be used to attack any Black stones in the middle for the rest of the game. At this point, it really is game over.]
