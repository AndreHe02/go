C[Kyo: Hello !

I am Kyoshinai, 11k on KGS.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dq]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[em];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[fn]C[Kyo: Black got a pretty good result here]
;W[ip];B[jp]C[Kyo: Too close to White's stone. When attacking a group, do it from a distance.]
;W[jo];B[kp];W[iq];B[ko];W[in];B[jn];W[io];B[kn];W[dj];B[gc]
C[Kyo: Not the point. The left Black group is in trouble if White attacks now.

A possible move could be around G8 or even H8, both strengthrning the wall and threatening to enclose White. Later on, a kakari around C14 could be appropriate to make good use of the wall]
;W[eb];B[fc]C[Kyo: This exchange does nothing but strength White. Better jump out straight away at K6]
;W[ec];B[jd];W[cl];B[dl];W[cm];B[dk];W[bm];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[bl];B[cj];W[ch];B[ei]C[Kyo: Better cap the stone with E10.]
;W[di];B[ej];W[eo];B[dh];W[ci]
(;B[dg]C[Kyo: The double hane works here, because of B10];W[fo]
;B[cg]C[Kyo: Black did well in not answering the two small moves from moves]
;W[cf];B[bh];W[bf];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[cc];B[fe];W[go]C[Kyo: Small again. If White wants to invade Black's moyo, he can do it anyways from J6. So answering G5 does not suppress the threat]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[im]C[Kyo: Black too a huge profit from White's mistakes.

Let's have a look at the game now : 
White has some territory in both the upper- and lower-left corners, but he is completly sealed in. White has a huge influence towards the center.

At that point, the game is almost over for White];W[hm];B[gl]
C[Kyo: Cut with H6. Black is letting White break through the seak - and enter his moyo - without even giving him a tough time]
;W[jm];B[il];W[kl];B[jl]C[Kyo: Try avoiding this kind of move, that are sente, but do nothing but strengthen White. Here the two stones obviously cannot be cut.]
;W[km];B[hl];W[jk];B[ij]C[Kyo: When you can cut, do it. Black's huge moyo is being reduced to nothing because of these submissive moves.

Moreover, you should not try making territory with a wall. The point is : attack White from the other side, making territory on the right by the way. The wall will prevent White from having an easy life anyways.]
;W[ik];B[kj]C[Kyo: There's a go proverb that says : "Cut where you can cut, and peep where you can't". Though it is not always good to listen blindly to proverbs, they should be kept in mind. Here Black can achieve much more with a cut than a peep.]
;W[kk];B[jj];W[hk];B[gk];W[hj];B[bb]C[Kyo: Not the point];W[bc]
;B[hi];W[ln];B[ii];W[lo];B[ed]C[Kyo: Not the point : Black has nothing to fear from here]
;W[cb];B[mj];W[mm];B[nl];W[nm];B[ol];W[om];B[pm];W[pn];B[ql]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[rn];B[lp];W[mp];B[mq];W[jq];B[lq];W[np];B[nq]
;W[op];B[oq];W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[gi]C[Kyo: Why not G10 ?];W[rl]
;B[rk];W[rp];B[rq];W[qq];B[pq];W[sq];B[qr];W[rr];B[qq];W[so]
;B[rs];W[ss];B[sr];W[sp]C[Kyo: Black has white live easily. However, he built a strong wall facing the upper side of the board.]
;B[bi]C[Kyo: Unnecessary];W[mk];B[nj];W[lj];B[li]C[I think I should have done  something crucially different here...?

Kyo: When White plays M10, M11 (your move) is the only move. You have nothing to fear here, White cannot cut.]
;W[lh];B[lk]C[Kyo: Good];W[ll];B[ml]C[Kyo: If you had played G10 instead of G11, bN8 would have been sente.]
;W[lj];B[rm]C[Kyo: The ko you are fighting for is worthless. The point is : stay connected. Black can play N11 for instance, that will prevent White from doing anything nasty here]
;W[mi];B[lk];W[ki];B[lj];W[mh];B[gj];W[lm];B[oh]C[Kyo: Good]
;W[nf];B[ne]C[Kyo: Do not attach stones you are attacking. Better O16, or even better Q14.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[pf];B[qf]C[Kyo: When trying to kill a group, all you have to do is not to let it make eyes. Therefore contact play has the *opposite* effect : with ataris, etc. the group can get an eye shape. Here the best would have been - in my humble opinion - around R12. A move at N14 can also be considered.]
;W[sm];B[pg]C[Kyo: Same here];W[me];B[ld]C[Kyo: Blocking at N16 is best]

Kyo: It is. But White has nothing to hope from that, and Black's best answer is to pass.]

;B[hh];W[je];B[fg];W[gh];B[fh]C[Kyo: All these moves should have remained unanswered : when White invades, he can have two goals :
- either to kill, which is obviously impossible
- or to live, which cannot reasonably be achieved either];W[tt]

[mk][nk][el][fl][fm][nr][or][pr][rr][ns][os][ps][qs][ss]C[Kyo: From that game, I think there are a few things you should focus on :
- first of all, do _not_ attach stones you are attacking. Play from a distance, so that you want strengthen them.
- do not try to use your walls to build territory. On the contrary, you should drive your opponents towards your wall, which means attacking from the other side.
- when you feel like you can cut, do not hesitate : do it ! Especially when it is in an area where you are strong
- as for coping with attacks, your main problem is that you are too submissive : if your opponent plays aggresively, don't simply step back. Try to find weaknesses in the shape of the attacking stones, and either cut them or chase them.
- finally, your main problem in the endgame is that you play too many unnecessary moves. In the yose (endgame), the goal is clear : make as many points as possible, while keeping the sente (initiative). Therefore, if you have time, have a look at all the possible moves. Try to see which ones are sente (ie moves that your oppenents has to respond to), and how much points they are worth. That will be difficult in the beginning, but if you keep at it, you will have less difficulties in that part of the game.


If you have any further question, please feel free to ask.]

(;B[ef]C[Kyo: Usually, when you can capture either with a net or a ladder, chose the net, because it captures in one move, when you will have - sooner or later - to add another move to capture completly the stone with a ladder.

However, here capturing D13 with a net allows white to connect his groups very easily.

SO the shicho is better here];W[df];B[de];W[ce];B[eg];W[bf]
