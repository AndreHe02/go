AB[pd][dp]C[[doitsu\]:
@ the reviewer:

Hi,

i use to play regularly on KGS. I think of myself at someone who has a "good" (beginner-good) understanding of strategy. I kinda favorise conceptual over brute force sollutions (everywhere in my life), so as you might guess, my reading skill is not that good. I try to overcome this  weakness with tsumego. The reason i tell this is - if you can give me some conceptual advice, do so. I play 7k already for quite some time - i want to improve and leave this awfullness behind me ^^ (not to serious here with awfulness).

White is obviously much stromger than me - but his play seems often very strange to me - i would appreciate explananations of whites plans, if you understand them - cause i do not.

Tom:
Black played better than White in the opening, and by move 90 White was in a nearly hopeless position.

In the middle game, Black had some critical misunderstandings about life & death, and lost a big group in the center, which made the game close again.

Probably out of frustration, black resigned.  In fact if the game had finished, Black still would have won by 3.5!

Big points:
1) Believe in your own strength, don't be intimidated
2) Learn to estimate better who is winning: you resigned a game that you won
3) work on middle game more, especially:
3.1) Keeping your groups connected
3.2) Keeping opponent's groups split
3.3) Reading Life & Death

Don't ask a player only 2 stones better than you if you should resign!  You should have more faith in your ability and not be afraid of stronger players.

White is not "obviously much stronger" and I will try to point out moves I thought were white mistakes, as well as black ones.]
;W[pp]C[doitsu [7k\]: hi gg
daba [5k\]: hi];B[dd];W[cg]C[[doitsu\]: I don't understand the idea of this move.


Tom:
Not common.  Most likely white is trying to confuse black early, since it's a handicap game.]
(;B[cj]C[[doitsu\]: I thought this move as an extension of D4


Tom: I prefer G17 or C15, but this seems ok.  Any other ideas I give in the opening are just ideas, don't assume I know what the best move is!]
;W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[[doitsu\]: I sometimes like the following sequence - now i think i should have played it here. Tell me if my sequence is crap please.

Tom:
Either is ok I think.  I put some notes on the other sequence]
;W[bc];B[bb]
(;W[ce]
(;B[ec]C[Tom:
Feels too close to your other stones.];W[gc]C[[doitsu\]: This was a surprise for me.

Tom:
Not for me.  E17 was a bit too close to your stones I think.]
;B[ic];W[db]C[[doitsu\]: Again a surprise.

Tom:
You need to always be looking for this kind of aji (potential).  You thought E17 protected your corner, but actually it was a bit worse.  Even so, I think it's too early for black to try something like this, I would jump out to G15 first. Did you think about blocking at C18?]
(;B[fc];W[gd]C[Tom:
Now you can block at C18.  I feel like this is important, because you're keeping both white groups deprived of a base.]
(;B[ef];W[fe]C[I don't think white gains anything from this move]
;B[ee];W[cb]
(;B[ba]C[Tom:
Instead, maybe start at G18];W[ab];B[eb];W[ca];B[gb]C[[doitsu\]: Now i thought: despite of the surprise - this worked as i expected: G17 is weak. ?? wrong?

Tom:
My intution is that this is OK, but not as good as you could have had: black lost the corner and in exchange gains a weak group to attack, but it may be hard to attack them profitably.  You could have played in a way where white had two weak groups.

However, the overall situation is still fine for black, because of the handicap.]
;W[gg];B[eh];W[dg]C[Tom:
This is a bad peep for W I think.  what does W gain?];B[eg]
(;W[bi]C[Tom:
To me this feels a bit small, hard to say.  White has some loose stones that must be cared for.]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[dj]C[Black made more from this exchange than white did.  Black's wall works perfectly with D4, and White only made a few points]
;W[cm]C[[doitsu\]: Again: Suprise for me - any explananations?


Tom:
Overplay.  I think this makes another weak group for white.  I think White's idea is to hopefully split around D11 later, but it's a hard plan to make work.]
;B[co]C[[doitsu\]: Idea: Hunt him horizontally, make some profit in the south.]
;W[em];B[gi]C[Good move: keeps both white groups weak.  White has problems now.]
;W[id];B[jd]C[Or just K17 maybe for black.]
(;W[hc]C[empty triangle, bad for W]
(;B[hb]C[I don't think you need to connect under]
(;W[hd]C[I don't understand this at all!! seems so bad!]
(;B[jc];W[if];B[kg];W[ih];B[ij];W[mc]C[Tom:
I understand white probably feels behind, but this is another play that's hard to make work, so close to black's strength.  Also, This is the third time white tries the distant approach (instead of the more normal O17).  It didn't really work the first two times, so maybe it's time for something different.

As white, I'd try something around F4 or maybe K4.];B[oc];W[me]
;B[of];W[nf];B[kf]C[[doitsu\]: I think this is a huge mistake from me.

Tom:
No, keeping the groups split is the right idea.  Those middle white stones haven't proved they can live yet.]

(;B[og]C[Another idea is around L11, see variation];W[qf]
(;B[qh];W[rd];B[rc];W[od];B[pc];W[mh]
(;B[le]C[Tom:
Hmm, I think your three Black stones are the weakest thing now.]
(;W[ld];B[je];W[lh];B[oh];W[kh]C[white played well to get out of a sticky situation, but there's still the left to deal with, and Black has made big profit on the right.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pq]C[Tom:
I don't like this for W, there's no time to take territory I think]
;B[jq];W[gq]C[White is still paying for giving Black the wall at D10 and black's strong play at G11.]
;B[go];W[dr];B[cr];W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp];B[fo];W[dn]
;B[do];W[bn]C[[doitsu\]: Its unbelievable how fast this guy forms living shapes. If this was starcraft i bet my a** this guy would play zerg. I seldom see people with his style.. although i know i am weaker than him, i really wanna know why this worked so good.

Tom:
Neither of these are living shapes!  You see his "[5k\]" tag and assume he can do magic.  One of these groups should definitely die.]
;B[hr]C[Good.  The white stones have only one eye now.  Not so living, after all.]

(;B[oo];W[op];B[np];W[po];B[pn];W[on]C[[doitsu\]: I should have seen this coming.

(;B[jm]C[Tom:
Right idea, but now I'm afraid for your stones on the right side, they don't have two eyes quite yet.
You should strive to understand what makes groups weak.  Ask yourself: If my opponent gains more strength in this area, can I still live?  Or will I need to respond?]
(;W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[io];W[jo];B[jp];W[ho];B[hn];W[hp];B[bo]
C[[doitsu\]: I was so proud here - i messed up in the end.  The real question from my side is: Why was white so successfull? Very much of what i "think" i know about go is violated - he tends to play next to my thickness almost immediately. When people about 7k on KGS do this - i usually smile - cause those are games i usually win. Here - the opposite. The g3 group is the first one of his to die. And my outside shape looks like... my flat. anyway.


Thx for your comments.


========FIN========

(because the rest is too emberassing)


Tom:
You should be proud, you played well!  You ask "why was white so successfull", but white has dead groups everywhere and no territory!  Every time white played next to your thickness it was an overplay, and for the most part you handled it well.  When I look at this board I see a huge win for black.  "When people about 7k on KGS do this - i usually smile - cause those are games i usually win. Here - the opposite."  This is the key to your difficulty I think.  Because it's a handicap game you assume white has amazing abilities.  Try to forget who you're playing, ranks, everything.  Just look at the board.  What do you see?

I know you wrote "FIN" here, but I have to go on.  I want to see where things went wrong :-)]
