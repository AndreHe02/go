;B[pp]C[Hi takemurafu,];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf];B[cc]
LB[db:A]C[This is much too early. In later stages, you can envision to invade this corner. As a result, you will reduce white territory, but your upper side, including the f17 stone, will be hurt in the process. For the moment you don't know which is more important, thus you have to wait, and decide later. Instead of invading, you might want to play at A, taking a little bit of territory anf reinforcing your f17 stone.]
;W[dc]C[Now, the normal sequence would be as in the variation]

(;B[cd]LB[ce:A]C[White should answer at A here];W[qe]LB[de:A]
C[This is a very bad move, there was no way to do tenuki here. You can cut at A, and hurt white very much as in the variation]

(;B[nd];W[qc]LB[qb:A]C[Your normal answer would be at A here.]
;B[qd]LB[pd:A]C[Now white should cut.]
(;W[rd];B[pd];W[lc];B[db]LB[de:A]C[No, A was the move here.]
;W[np];B[qm];W[ic];B[jq]LB[rc:A]C[As white made tenuki on the upper right corner, cuting at A is big as it leaves white's 2 stones without a base, very seriously hurt. It also gives you some territory and definitely strengthen your corner group.]
;W[ci];B[gq];W[eq];B[de];W[rc];B[pe]LB[rc:A][pe:B]C[Do you see how this exchange of A for B is good for white?]
;W[qf];B[nh];W[pf];B[of];W[en];B[df];W[pi]LB[ck:A]TR[cf][ci]
C[Now the focus is on the lower leftt area, not permitting white to make a big territory here can be achieved rather easily I think as the marked two white stones ar not very strong. Consider invading at A for instance, attacking those 2 stones.]
;B[qj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[sj]LB[rj:A][np:B]C[If you want to make a move here, rather connect at A so that white does not get forcing moves on the outside. But this area is smaller than the bottom left area, and smaller than attacking stone B also]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[cg];B[ce]LB[ed:A]C[If you want to connect, you have A, but this was probably not pressing.]
;W[fh]C[Now it's much harder to invade the lower left corner]
;B[gf]C[This is not useful, what purpose has this move?];W[nb]
;B[ob];W[nc];B[oc]C[Similarly, what were the purpose of these 2 moves? You don't make territory, while white does.]
;W[md];B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[oq]LB[pq:A][qq:B]C[White got the two big points: consolidating the lower left, and defending its O4 stone/ or using it to invade the corner. As a matter of fact, this move is rather bad, white should have retained the possibility to attack at A or invade at B.]
;B[pq];W[nn];B[op];W[oo];B[nq];W[mq];B[nr];W[lp];B[mr];W[lr]
;B[po];W[pn];B[qn];W[jo];B[ho];W[hm];B[fo]LB[fr:A]C[Maybe consider A as a "forcing" move first.]
;W[hi];B[eo];W[do];B[cq]LB[do:B][eo:A]C[Exchanging A for B was bad with respect to this invasion. fwiw I don't think you should live here.]
;W[bp];B[dq]CR[cf][ci]LB[ep:A]TR[cq]SQ[eo][fo][ho][gq][jq]C[Connecting at A was probably enough for white. You have to get both your "square" rgoup and your "triangle" group alive, and this seems impossible. Invading when the opponent is string and you have a weak group nearby is always a bad idea. On the contrary, you want to invade when it can weaken some enemy stones, as could have been the case earlier by attacking the two "circle" stones.]

;W[go];B[em];W[hn];B[dn];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[kq]LB[ck:B]
[fl:A]C[Here you should proceed and enter white's territory at A or B etc instead of killing white's group in the whole following sequence.]
