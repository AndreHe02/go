C[Matteo> Hi, This is the last match I've played on IGS. I've lost but I  don't know where I made my errors.
Could you comment my game and my style of play ?

Thanks !

Ankh:
Certainly: I'd be happy to. As already shown, my comments will  be indicated with my name, and I shall try to be clear while keeping  variation density to a minimum, but things may get messy. I hope you find my  commentary helpful.

You seem to play well throughout most of the game, with maybe a few  strategical flaws, but some major errors/ misreads toward the end seem to  turn the game against you. You demonstrate a strong knowledge of the basics  for the rank that you have set, and for the most part just need to get a  better feel for the game. From what I understand, this game is about  balance, and understanding the relationship between the merits strength,  influence, power, flexibility, stability, and immediate territory. On the  whole, you play a bit too agressively, paying more often than not less  attention to your own safety, security, and stability than you should. You  play a few attacking moves that are overplay, leaving you worse off than if  you had played more securely and permissively of your opponents life. When  you expect a play to do more than it can, the net result is usually that the  move accomplishes very little. KNowing when it is safe to fight, and to what  degree this is possible, is critical.]

;B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[pj];B[jd]TR[cn][of][pf]C[Matteo> Now I think black is better placed on goban

Ankh: Maybe, but I'm not sure. While you do have advantages,  its important  to take into account strengths and weaknesses of each sides position. So  far, the game has been not too confrontational, and as the fuseki has played  out, you seemed to have focused on the upper side almost exclusively. while  you do still  have two wide open spaces to invade/reduce the bottom and the  right. Hewever, there are some things to beware of. Your marked stones are  at the moment a little weak, The upper two because they can be cut in  conjunction with invasion, and the other because it is alone. and can be put  under attack. In building the top, which seems currently to be your main  prize, You'll have to be careful to:
1, Avoid spending too many moves there. You've already spent 7 on this  general area.
2. At some point extract profit/strengthen invasion in the upper right could  be strong, because of the stength of cutting/threatening your two marked  stones, possibly the corner as well. Something like P 13 seems appropriate,  as it would uxtend your frame while stengthening the blackstones and  threatening to cut into white's side, seems appropriate. K14 is a strong  place here for similar reasons, but N16 or therabouts is probably more  locally urgent, since it will stabilize your side, make firm territory, make  possible extremely strong control of the side with G17 (ish), and because by  strengthening your base, it lends strength to the previously mentioned high  moves at P13, K14. Of course, timing is critical as there are many other big  points elsewhere, but this should be born in mind as you form your strategy.]
;W[dj];B[en];W[cg];B[ck];W[cj]LB[cp:A][cq:B]C[Matteo> I still have the choice to play at A or B, so I think I'm best  placed.

Ankh: Yes, but you are the least secure of the two groups. Etheir D9 or  invasion at A or B are stabilizing moves that should be made with some  haste, espocially if one of them is pevented. Thus, white moves like A, or  even D9 are good as possible sente plays for white. you do well in playing  aginst the white group, but if you are going to tenuki, you must remember to  come back and tend to your own group later on. Stability is important, and  seems to be your biggest weakness so far on the board.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[eh];B[cf]C[Ankh: Nice: you are building a big moyo along the top, pretty much with  initiative, but keep strengthening/solidifying plays on your agenda; you  don't want to build the walls too much at the foundation's expense.]
;W[fj]C[Ankh: This jump also turns toward your awkward side group. Play to  strengthen it is important to keep influence and territory in white's part  of the goban.]
;B[fh]C[Ankh: Play at the bottom is more urgent, and this seems a little too  agressive against the white group, which can live when it wants. You leave a  strong cutting point at F13, and thus have just introduced another weakness.  F/G13 would be better locally because of this.]
;W[cl]C[Ankh: White attacks  where you are  insecure.]
(;B[bk]C[Ankh: You have to play lightly here because you are one move behind saving  everything. Your move can't split if the splitting stones die.]

(;W[dk]TR[bk][ck]C[Ankh: The resulting sequence is bad for white. If B8 were played instead,  you would have a much tougher time keeping your stones. Your best option  might turn out to be simply letting the marked stones die and running with  the other two. Hopefully, this helps show why your group was unstable. See  variations.]

Ankh: Good. You emerged with good result and can try to undermine white's  security.]
;W[lc]C[Matteo>
I've thought that this is a wasted stone. I was sure to kill white because
he doesn't have a lot of space, but....

Ankh: White has a lot of potential because no strengthening moves were  played. White can cut, jump, run, or form a base, but yes, it will be a  tough fight.]

C[Matteo> I've tryed to give back the gift..

Ankh: But bear in mind that White probably wasn't counting on getting all  the empty space, while you seemed to have been putting a lot into your moyo.  This allows a pincer which just builds in sente for white.]

C[Ankh: A bad exchange that is one of the bigger mistakes of the game. The  Black stones can come under attack and the territory that they aim at can be  reduced greatly (a,b). White gets far more in return: Center territory  bordered by  the marked stones that is much harder to take.]
