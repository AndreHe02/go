C[Hi, as requested, I'll do the review for white.
My comments start with B:

B: I'm only 7 kyu, so I'm still learning myself, but hopefully I can point a few things out and get you in the right direction.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[pj]C[B: traditional Chinese opening for black. The response I see often is R14.]
;B[qj];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[om];B[pn]C[B: this gives black almost certain territory, so I'd prefer to go for more influence with Q11, or Q12.]
(;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe]
;W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[qo];W[oo];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[fo]C[B: never seen this move. Don't know if it works. What if black plays E4? See variation.]
(;B[iq]
(;W[jq]C[B: it's better to keep a little distance when attacking. See variations.]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[ip];W[kp]LB[on:B][oq:A]C[B: because A and B are still open, L4 doesn't secure any territory.]
;B[in];W[io]
(;B[ho]C[B: what if black plays H5? Might get quite messy for white, see variation.]
;W[jo];B[hn];W[jn];B[il];W[im];B[hm];W[jm];B[ik]
(;W[gk]C[B: this is a good point if you want to prevent eyespace for black, but in this situation black will live, so it's better to defend your own space. For example F7 - exactly where black plays his next move.]
;B[fm];W[en];B[fn]
(;W[em]C[B: still not too late to defend from a distance, see variation.]
;B[fl];W[el]LB[fk:A]C[B: you now have an open gate at A. Impossible to defend.]
;B[fk];W[gj]C[B: can you save this stone? If not, leave it and defend the other side, for example D10.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[dj]
(;W[do]C[B: there is enough room to live in the corner, and you do not need the stone at F5, so you can play C9 for example.]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[ci];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[cf];W[df];B[ce];W[de]
C[B: again, you build up a wall for influence while giving black territory. This is a good strategy, IF you can later on collect your investment with more territory.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[cd];W[cg];B[dh];W[cc];B[bg];W[eh]C[B: good. You also prepare to link up to your G10 group.]
;B[ic]C[B: now, this is a tough one. Black will probably live, or run towards J9.]
(;W[id]C[B: a direct hit is mostly not the best response. Better to play from a distance.]
(;B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd];B[kb];W[kc];B[lb];W[lc];B[jb];W[jc]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[ed];B[db]C[B: this is not a bad outcome; black kept himself low at the top and you have another wall. NOW is the time to collect.
I'm pretty sure you can cut at H8. See variation for the next move.]
(;W[cb];B[go]
(;W[eo]C[B: is it a problem if black captures F5? He is already alive, and connected with the left side group.]
;B[ii];W[hi]C[B: cut at H8?];B[hj];W[gi];B[gl];W[ei];B[ej]LB[ci:A]
[hm:B]C[B: black doesnt have to respond. Both groups A and B are alive on their own.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[fc];B[fb];W[fd];B[nn];W[on];B[ln]
(;W[mn]C[B: this is a good move if the O6 stone is connected to the right side, but now it are 2 loose stones between your walls. There is not enough room to make eyes. 
So it's better to just cap them and prevent them from running towards the J8-J9 group. See variation.]
;B[mm];W[mo];B[ko];W[lo];B[lm]
(;W[kn]C[B: same situation; keep black separated. L8.];B[kl]
;W[nm];B[mk]C[B: black is creating territory here.]
(;W[ml]C[B: if you cannot cut, try another move. For example, defend the territory you have (if there is no other black group to attack).]
;B[ll];W[nl];B[mj];W[nj]C[B: see next comment.];B[mh];W[nh]
LB[if:B][ph:A]C[B: this (A) is not the side you want to defend. It is still open. Area B can be bigger.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[ng];W[og];B[ni];W[oh];B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[nk]

;W[ke];B[mf];W[le];B[kh]C[B: no need for black to respond.]
;W[jg]C[B: if a move doesn't work, leave it as it is. You can later use it as a ko threat.]
;B[kg];W[hk];B[hl];W[ij];B[jj];W[hj];B[ji]C[B: no need for black to respond.]
;W[fi]C[B: good.];B[jk];W[qh]C[B: good.];B[ri];W[rh];B[pg];W[ph]
;B[rf];W[sg];B[sf];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd]C[B: this shouldn't live, if black responds correctly.]

[hr][sr][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[B: conclusion: you played a good game on influence, giving some direct territory to black, but getting a nice wall here and there. But, you had a hard time turning the investment into actual points.

When playing for influence, you know your opponent will invade sooner or later. He will live, but if he lives small, you get enough points on the outside or center.

Attacking too direct (attaching to stones) gives the opponent a chance to put you under pressure and to walk into your area, destroying possible points there.

I hope I showed you some pointers in the right direction. Keep it up, play, and have fun.]
