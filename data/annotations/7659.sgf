C[Hi, I've put some questions inside up to move 46, but I have feeling that even after that point, besides my mistakes, the result was still not decided, thanks for any comments for white side,
regards
Marcin Balaban (oslito)


Hey Marcin,
I'm Max, a 6kyu from GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.

I'll prefix all my comments in the main game line with "Max-" and try to address all the questions you added.

I'll also give a summary of the review at the end of the game.]

(;W[cm]C[Max-
This is a very passive answer to the kakari at E3. It should only be used if white wants to solidify his C3 stone quickly.

In this situation there is no reason to play this safe variation. D6, D5 or maybe a pincer give better results for white.

See variations.];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[dp];B[dq]LB[qe:B][pn:A]
[fo:C][br:D]C[Max-
You only consider to play at A or B.

These are both moves that make some sense point-wise, but the far more important matter at the moment is blacks weak D3 group.

There is a saying "Playing near live groups is small". What this means is that you should always consider playing near  weak groups first (yours or your enemys).

I think pushing your opponent down with something like C and building the left side could make sense here.

D makes takes points but makes life too easy for black.]
(;W[pn]C[Would be better to play R16 instead?

Max-
See commentary for move 11 for what moves would be better.

In a local context R6 is usually a better kakari than Q6.

You would only want to approach high if you aim at building a moyo on that side.]
;B[nq]LB[pk:A][qp:B]
(;W[pk]C[I don't know if this extension on 4th line is correct?

Max-
This is not joseki, see variation.

Black should now play R6.]
(;B[pe]LB[od:A][qe:B][qg:C]
(;W[od]C[Max-
Usually when black approaches high, white decides if he wants the corner (variation B) or if he wants to pincer.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[qg]LB[fc:A][kc:B][qi:C]C[Max-
Again, playing near weak groups is big! Look at the board, which groups are weak at the moment?

A is out of focus.

B strengthens white's weak P16 group in preparation for attacking R16 strongly.

C attacks R16 directly, maybe a bit premature considering how weak P16 still is, but interesting because it also strengthens white's Q9 group.]
;W[fc]C[To much agressive?];B[ec];W[fd];B[cd];W[jc]C[Am I right if I think that now white is in better situation?

Max-
Well, point-wise it is about equal. White seems to have better thickness.

I think the most interesting issue now, is how the right side will play out.]
;B[iq]LB[ch:A][qi:B]
(;W[ch]C[Max-
Wrong direction, the right side is urgent!

See variation.];B[qj]C[Max-
Black gets there first : (]
(;W[qo]C[Max-
You should try and strengthen the Q9 group without giving away the corner.

See variation.];B[qp];W[qk];B[mn];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[jn];W[rj]
;B[qi];W[rm]C[3 times gote :-/  but what would be correct play?

Max-
Yes, this was horrible. White shouldn't have gotten sealed in.

The way you solidified the group (by exchanging strength for territory & influence) is only for emergency situations.

A better solution would have been to run away or strengthen it against the R10 group, see variation at move 27.]
;B[ri];W[nf];B[je]LB[ld:B][ke:A][jg:C]
(;W[ke]C[bad direction?

Max-
You're touching a weak stone, this can't be good.

When you played O14, you were inviting black to reduce your top moyo. Now he has, and you got a stone you can attack.

By touching it though, you are going to make it stronger, thus eliminating your chance of gaining something by attacking it.

See variations.];B[jf];W[jd];B[he];W[hg]C[to much agressive?

Max-
It's the shape point, looks pretty severe.

Black should run at K12.];B[gf];W[ee];B[eg]LB[df:A][fg:B][ei:C]
C[Max-
Black's keima at E13 looks like an overplay.

You could consider just cutting at B.

Or take profit by playing C, the cut is still left for later.]
(;W[df]C[Max-
Wrong direction. White isn't gaining anything with this stone.

L14 would have been the spot to fix white's shape.

L10 is left quite weak, I think white has to fix first.

G5 is slow and induces black to fix his shape at G3. Maybe jumping in directly is better.

Max-
The main thing to work on is deciding which groups are weak and how you can use this to your advantage.

In the opening and mid-game, try to gauge the relative strength or each group on the board and *then* decide where to play. Usually playing near weak groups is bigger than playing near live ones (moves 11 & 25).

Also, try not to touch weak stones (move 45).

When you have the weak group though, you should try strengthening it by touching strong stones (move 27).

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this review and will take one or two ideas from it. If you have any questions don't hesitate to write back!

All the best,
