AB[dd][pp]C[Hi, 

I will make a few comments about the points you have asked for help with here, but you will find them throughout the game.

You can put more pressure on your opponent in the in late opening/midgame by following some suggestions around move 22/23, pressing black against the edge. You should also look for sente moves and play them. In the endgame, you gain a lot of points this way.

I have labled some overplays in the game -  31 and 85 stand out. In a handicapped game it will be necessary to overplay a little.

There didn't appear to be many easy opportunities for you to invade â€“ move 51 was one possibility (not strictly an invasion) there were more opportunities for black to invade in my opinion. I think that reducing would have been a better and safer tactic here.

The two points could easily have been made up in the endgame. Look for the sente moves. Also look for economical moves, e.g 113.

The fuseki was good. I made notes at move 5, 10 and 15.

I hope this was helpful.]PL[W];W[pd];B[dq];W[do];B[fp];W[cf]
LB[dl:A][dq:1]SQ[do]C[The marked stone is obviously weak. I think that, having played so close to 1, I would have followed up with a second stone for support around A. 

Black can afford to ignore C14 and still profit from D16. If black plays around A, your stone may become a weak group or a wasted move.

Alternatively black,may have tried a distant pincer play.]

(;B[gq]LB[kq:A]C[This is an example of black playing passively. The right side is very strong  and left side stronger than white's.

(;W[fn]LB[lc:1][dg:A][pg:3][pr:2]C[This move does not contain black, but makes your moyo on the left very large. However, the right hand side is possibly underdeveloped and black can easily reduce the left.

1 is slow, but quite big and ensures the life of the group
2 is also quite big in my opinion
3 I would play 3]
