C[Arroc: I'll be reviewing for white. 

Overall, you seem to want to protect every group. You also seem very scared of your opponent getting territory. Keep in mind that it's okay to let your own small and weak groups die. Also, often playing non-aggressively can help to avoid painful losses.]

[ep:B][jq:E]C[Here, you have several choices.

A - Extend along the side to answer blacks attempt at territory.
B - Approach the corner.
C - Try to reduce, but one higher.
D - Build your own territory in a peaceful way.
E - Make a group on black's side.]
(;W[qo]C[am I attacking strong stones?

Arroc: Yes. Better to answer by extending down the other side or approaching the bottom left corner.

If you really want to reduce, better to do so one higher. You don't have room to live on the third line.]
