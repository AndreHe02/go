Here is your game - unfortunately I cannot get the Commentary to work  with my version of MGT for Windows (version0.4) so I am going to have
to put my comments in here.

The main areas of development I see for you are to combine attacking play  with developing territory and to notice vulnerable connections and build
more solid walls.

q8 - I'd play either at R11 or Q7 so as to ensure territory

D18 - Bad move - to share the corner connect at D17 - E18 becomes  vulnerable

C15 - Play at D15 to be solid

E19 - To protect against this kind of invasion play moves to make solid
walls

R4 - Much better move here than D18

K10 - Good move attacking but also territorial

P4 - Watch for these vulnerable edge positions like S6 - players will often
watch for them

P7 - You had the same problem in this corner - as in other one - most
diagonal connections are vulnerable - you do get to make a wall in the
end but do it earlier - the wall you make then radiates influence up
the board

H3 - needs a response - G4 or J4 - you would then start to build a wall
here - also G4 then becomes less of a threat

G6 - This is too attacking - allows H6 - play H6 yourself - 3 stone walls  are much stronger - then hane

G10 - Notice how white builds a wall and then extends from it

F8 - excellant move - you both attack and build territory

J13 - again good move

L12 - better to strengthen K10 so white cant get around it - keep
white heavy here

C8 - the main tactical tasks here are to attack white so he doesnt
get eyes - to stop the centre group connecting - and to consolidate
territory in top right - E10 would be good here - it stops the eye  and you just keep white heavy

E19 - A better option is O19 which will kill the white group

Q19 - White saves his group !!

P13 - forgetting these vulnerable stones is the kind of mistake a lot of us  make !! and vow to never
make again !

C4 - a better place to invade - but still an overplay - is C3 - the 3/3
point is nerely alwys the most attacking place to invade.


In general terms I'd recommend that you focussed on good shape - Life
and Death by Ishi Press is quite good on this as is the second book
of Go.];W[tt]C[
