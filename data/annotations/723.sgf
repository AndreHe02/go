AB[dd][dj][jd]LB[fi:a];W[jj];B[gk];W[kf];B[hd];W[jl];B[kh]C[RickMott: Black should not invade here.  The sensible thing
to do is to build on the moyo at left with C7, B7 or a point
around the center.];W[jh];B[jg];W[ji]C[RickMott: as White here, I would cut right away.  If Black just
connects, the single white stone will be in trouble.  If Black
tries atari at 9 next, what does Black do when white extends?
White threatens to capture the K7 stone in a net or put K5/L6
in double atari.  So white should play L7.];B[jf]C[RickMott: Black must connect at L7.  If you do, White is separated
and you are out.  Great for black, terrible for white.  Your move
helps the outside, but it's overconcentrated with the corner stones.]
;W[kg];B[ke]C[RickMott: But at least you get this move in sente.]
;W[lh];B[lf]C[RickMott: But you shouldn't follow up here.  It's a small move.
Consider G6, for example; it ties your upper and lower groups
together and makes 3/4 of the board your moyo.];W[lg];B[ld]
C[RickMott: again, small local move.  Think bigger.];W[ie];B[if]
C[RickMott: Why here?  Where is the white stone going to go?  I would
either connect at K9, removing the threat to two stones, or surround
on a larger scale at H7.  Or maybe still ignore it and play G6.  How
will white either make eyes or kill you?  J9 is almost surrounded.]
;W[ic];B[jc]C[RickMott: Buy Janice Kim's book on cutting and connecting.  You
need to focus on keeping your groups connected.  There's no reason
not to connect at J10; you separate White and link your groups with
one move.  Are you afraid White will live in the corner somehow?
So what?  At best you kill White; at worst you should come out
with sente and a huge outside wall.];W[id];B[ib]C[RickMott: H9 would be better.  You're leaving too many cut points.]
;W[hb];B[jb];W[hc];B[gc]C[RickMott: extend at G10 instead.  You just need to stay strong and
White will have a hard time.];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[gf]C[RickMott: cutting and connecting again.  If white wants to, he can
live almost immediately by atari at F11.  Consider connecting at F11
or hanging connection at F12.];W[fe];B[hf];W[he];B[ee];W[fc]
;B[gb]C[RickMott: This move doesn't help; you can't escape.  Having invested
all those outside stones, play F8 to keep your moyo intact.]
;W[fb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ch]C[RickMott: This is a critical time.  I think this move doesn't do
enough for you because it's not decisive; can't make up your mind
whether to take the side or the corner, so you play in the middle.
Better would be C3 or C4, or even F8 and let White choose.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[bc]C[RickMott: C3 to take corner securely, or (still) F8.]
;W[bb];B[bd];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[cl]C[RickMott: ignore the corner, you can't kill; play C5 and take some
profit on the outside.];W[bl];B[dl];W[bm];B[cm]C[RickMott: Bad shape, very small move.  What were you trying to do?
If you're trying to kill White, this doesn't reduce his eyes.  You
could try A4, or B5 which also helps enclose the left.];W[ci]
;B[di]C[RickMott: Once White gets 55, I think you're better off to play B6
and try for some territory.  It's now very hard to kill.];W[bh]
;B[bg]C[RickMott: Double hane leaves too many cut points.  Extend at C7,
then you can either close F8 or make (small) territory with B7.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[dh]C[RickMott: Letting white break into your potential moyo here is
unfortunate.  Black is behind now.];B[kk]C[RickMott: I can't find a move here that keeps Black in the game.
Best chance is maybe G6, try to make 10 pts or so from your wall
at lower left.  But I think you're still behind.];W[kj];B[jk]
;W[ik];B[il];W[kl];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[hl];B[gl];W[im];B[gm]
C[RickMott: G6 still makes the most territory for you, but you had
to give up too much to get it.];W[gh]C[RickMott: and when White takes the critical point, there's basically
no hope.  If you can focus more on keeping your groups strong and
connected, and less on trying complicated hanes, you'll be two
stones stronger.  Good luck!  (end of review)];B[cf];W[df];B[de]
