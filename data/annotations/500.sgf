C[I made countless mistakes in joseki and so forth--would you mind providing
feedback on what I am doing wrong?  It may be too frustrating for you to look
at :)

Didier : I make countless mistakes in my games too :-)
It was for me a difficult game to comment, due to many struggles involving numerous weak groups of stones. Particularly, a fight was initiated at the early stage of the game. In this fight, there were many many tactical possibilities leading to totally different outcomes,  which I am unable to read out :-(
General comment : Both Black and White played a lot of contact play. This have lead to hand-to-hand fighting. For sure, it sometimes lead to capture some stones... But contact plays are very often defensive moves, as it leads for both to add stones, so reinforcement of both. Contact plays are often used to stabilize yourself. I think you could remember the proverb 'Atari is never a good move'. If during a fight you have the possibility of putting a stone in atari, do not follow your instinct. Think about the overall situation. Think about extending a single stone instead of using this stone to atari an opponent's one. But remember also that any proverb has a lot of exceptions...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[Black plays a san-ren-sei. This kind of fuseki is influence and big moyo building oriented. In this kind of fuseki, the Black goal is often to build a large moyo and wait for a White invasion. Then Black attacks White and in the process makes territory. Well, that is what is said by dan level players...]
;W[ej]LB[cj:a]C[Not so often seen. The weak point is at a, a Black move here can destroy White potential territory on the side. But there is no emergency in playing this move...]
;B[cj]LB[jd:a][jp:b][fc:c][fq:d][cn:e][cf:f]TR[ej]C[Deep invasion, too early in the game I think. Do not forget that you will be at a disavantage when you invade this way : White has already 3 stones on the side. I think there is no need to invade so deeply right now : you will put yourself on the spot. It seems better to play at a (or b) first. If White replies by playing C10, play b (or a). Your stones will work on a grander scale.
If you play i.e a and White plays at b, later on, if you want to invade the White formation on the left, you have moves like e or f. Due to the high position of the marked stone, it will be difficult for White to deprive them of a base, as you will have sliding moves under the marked stone to stabilize yourself.
Or if you do not want to play a or b, you can play kakari at c, or d.]
;W[ci]LB[di:a][ck:b]C[Contact play. White gives Black a chance to stabilize quickly.
