in the game you do it well, at least!];B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb];W[gc]
;B[hb];W[ge];B[if];W[gg]C[standard  pattern, no? :)];B[ff]L[je]C[not good ... making white here strong means  making himself weaker around 'a'.]
;W[gf];B[nd];W[qf];B[qh]L[re]C[i prefer 'a'...];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re]
L[pc]C[conclusion after all might  be that b should play at 'a' now.]

(;W[rc]C[lars: now, I would prefer  this on S18, b plays T16, w S17, b R15, w O18.]

(;W[bj]L[lp]C[looks a little strange...  maybe you can think of 'a' now? it helps your moyo at least... hard to say  anyway where to play now...]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[dm];W[dk];B[cn];W[do];B[fm];W[fo];B[en]C[makes lower group very weak...]
;W[eo];B[ek]
(;W[el]C[i think B is better.];B[dl];W[fk]L[ej][bl][el]M[el]C[seems taking the stone with 'a' is more wise... and take  'b' in sente... only the marked stone is then played for nothing...]
;B[ej];W[fl];B[em];W[bl];B[cj];W[bk];B[gl];W[fj]L[gk]C[i think 'a' is better now..]
;B[bm]L[fi]C[must be 'a'! if b had played there w would really have  looked lost! (b has to play 71 later)]

[ei];B[di];W[gi];B[eh];W[hj];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[ai]C[lars: I am not happy with this  situation. A8 lives, but I missed it in the actual game. The bottom left  group is getting too weak.
i can understand that feeling, compare the situation to the one before you  started b10 action!... the result is not perfect.]
;W[gm]L[al]C[it's better to live first....];B[gn];W[hm];B[fn];W[go]L[gp][hn][gq]C['a' is funny now :) makes 'b' and 'c' miai... but  b will take 'b' and still the group on the left is not alive...]
;B[hn]
(;W[gq]L[gp]C[lars: Possibly F3 better.  now it's evident... the move before should have been 'a'!
let's look at B variation :) seems you wont get more of it...];B[gr];W[fq]
;B[fr];W[hp];B[im]
(;W[iq]L[hl]C[spoils a possibility! white got in a tough situation, maybe you  should first live, then the variation B and 'a' is miai....]

(;W[ir]M[eq][er]C[lars: This is  unfortunately not sente against b corner group. because of the marked  exchange!]
;B[al]C[lars: dead :-(];W[jp]L[bi]C[maybe  heavy! because of 'a' (killing all the liberties) the game seems lost now...]
;B[kn];W[kp];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[qk];B[nn];W[pn]C[lars: I think I am too far behind now,  but continued to play for a while anyway.]
