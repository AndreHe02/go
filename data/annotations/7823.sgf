C[Hi thanks for reviewing my game. I played as white in this game.  There was a section in the game where I feel it would have been reasonable to kill a lagre black group but was not sure on wheter this was feasible so in the end I did not try. I also suspect that a times I get a little careless in a few places.


Scott,

JFR:  Hi Scott, I'm John [5k\] and I'll be reviewing your game.  Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.]

(;W[md]C[JFR:  I believe this leaves openings at the top that you will end up having to patch up later with an extra move.  The two space is too wide and lets b make points and take sente in this area]
;B[ch];W[qh]C[I felt c12 could be ignored and attacking r14 to be more beinficial.

JFR:  I would look at some approach moves at the bottom.  The pincer here is not very effective since the two space corner closure is somewhat thin.]
;B[ph]C[JFR:  This seems to be an overplay by b]
(;W[qi]C[Utlimately I lost these two white stones.

JFR:  This move seems too slow.  If you are going to play this direction try Q11.  Helps build a base and puts more pressure on b.  Also look ar var for Q13 w.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[pe];W[rd];B[qe];W[pc];B[qk]C[JFR:  If that w S11 stone was placed at Q11 you could make atari and perhaps repincer.or escape in a better way]
(;W[pi]C[I was looking for a way to run centre];B[oh];W[qn]
;B[ri]C[JFR: very strange move for b, not connected !!!];W[rj]
C[This was played in the hope that later it may be possible to conenct this group or ortherwise use it for ko threats, other than that I decided it was useless and abandoned it after this move.

JFR: hum, it is rather early in the game to place a stone in hope of a ko threat.  There are bigger and more important moves around]
;B[rk]
(;W[qq]C[Given black appeared to be building a moyo i knew i had to do something though perhaps i was too eary with this? I also considered jumping out with p6 but the above black group was strong and black could easily sterngthen the corner after p6 so i decided against it.

JFR:  3-3 is very tricky and has to be used at just the right time (if at all).  It is a good sequence to know and understand, but at the 10 - 15k level I find it is played too often in situations where it strengthens the other color a large amount (and leaves you completely confined an with little territory.

I don't see black building a moyo.  I see side territory.  r6 doesn't have a base, and black can make many points while you make life.]

(;W[ed]C[I wanted a play around here at some point as I felt it was pretty big I chose this in order to secure the corner.

JFR:
This kind of corner enclosure is awkward at best.  It has absolutely no affect on black and looks too concentrated.  If you play something like the C16 D14 combo it is best to either pincer C12, or play a larger extension around F17 to j19 since these would do much better against an actual invasion.]
