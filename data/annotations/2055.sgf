C[Frank: Better at R3.
R4 or R5 are now too good  for black.];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]C[Frank: Good, punishes white for his aggressive move 12. Black can attack now at either side.]
;W[dn];B[hp]C[Frank: This attack is too close to the white stone.  J4 or K3 put pressure on white 14, without making white so strong as in the game.]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[io];B[dr]C[Frank: continue the attack with J6 is more important. H6 is now a very good (shape) point for white]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[fn]C[Frank: J6 is still better.];B[gn];W[fm]
C[move 24: I felt a disadvantage in position because of white's expanded left side

Frank: Whites left side is getting big, true, but you've got a big moyo on the upper side and an attack on the white stones under.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[im]C[Frank: Here you could be more agressive by playing double hane with K7. Try it out for yourself. Your stones left under can make two eyes for themselves if necessary. Now you're letting white out too easy.]
;W[mq];B[lp]C[Frank: This leaves too many cutting points in your position. Better N4.]

Frank: Here it's not so difficult to foresee what's coming. You have to look after your corner first.]

;B[pi];W[pk];B[qi];W[oi]
(;B[oh]C[Frank: Better leave this atari unplayed.  R12 is good enough (see variation), it leaves more possibilities for black. O10 is also possible, more agressive, more risky.]
;W[ni];B[pg];W[nh];B[og];W[kl]C[white
gained a strong middle, altough I didn't feel too bad about because of my
 strong upperright corner

Frank: Your upper right corner can still be invaded, but you've got a strong right side. White on the other hand cannot complain either. His stones on the right side - which were under attack - are now safe and as a bonus  he catches N5 and N6]

Frank: Not if you read the situation. You could play S3 yourself. See variation.]

(;B[pm];W[rq]C[S3 look too good to me, R2 or Q2 would be better for white I think.

Frank: he could have started with Q2, but then still S3];B[ql]
;W[nj];B[qk];W[ok];B[pr];W[qr];B[qs];W[nr]C[Frank: Should be at S1. White can't expect to catch the black group, which is connected.]

Frank: S1 would have been better indeed. White is much too greedy here.]

but I tried
now my earlier lost battles became very usefull because of the ko-threats

Frank: In situations like this, it's better to play on and wait for a good opportunity to start the ko.  You can only lose a few stones, he can lose the whole corner. You've got good ko-threats, that's true, but it's a three-step ko, and later on in the game, you might have even better ko-threats.]

I still didn't think the upper right was totally safe, I considered the white
stones as dead

Frank: Yes, you're completely back in the game now.];B[ce]C[Frank: I would prefer something like J16 to try to consolidate the upper side. If you're concerned about whites left side, it's now time for something like G9 or G14. B2  is also big, but not absolutely sente.]

C[to my opinion, he could have attacked F9 very easy
now threatening to cut with sente worth 5 points, I believed that continuing the invasion at the right side was worth more

Frank: Yes, this is very small.];B[dk];W[kf];B[ld]C[here he resigned
Because I didn't think I had a big advantage in points, this surprised me
I guess the reason he resigned was that things didn't go as he had planned

I played the game out for myself and did get about 5 points more than he had.
but I think he did stand a change in this position

It's a bit strange that there are still so many big moves in this stage of the game.
afterwards, C5 looked to me as a good invading spot. a pitty that I didn't get a chance to play it

Generally I have the following questions :

-1 : how could I avoided white having such a big right side?
-2 : after my first lost battle(s) white had a big advantage, where did he go wrong?
-3 : is my estimate of when played out, I would have won with about 5 points realistic?

Frank:
1° If you didn't want white to make such a left (right  for you) side, you should have played there earlier.  But you mustn't forget you had a big upperside, so it was not abnormal that whites side was also big.

2° His invasions in the right upperhand corner and upperside were complete failures. There he threw away the advantage he had.

3°Let's make a rough estimation:
Black right side: 50 points (assuming the white stones in the upper corner are dead. Upper side: 33 points Under side 11
A total of 93 points
White: Left upper corner: 3, left side: 15 points
middle: 34 points: right under corner 5 points
A total of 57 points + komi

So you're leading big. I don't know where your estimation comes from. White could try to attack the black cutting stones in the middle around F11, but he has to take care not to be captured himself

In general I should say that you have to focus a little more on the big points and not get distracted by the local fights.]
