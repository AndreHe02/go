C[Hello and thanks for taking the time to review this.

This is a recent game I played as black and lost by resignation... a stronger friend had a look at it and said I was doing well up until some 'strange moves' and that I generally lost it at some point... I can't find where I made the mistake however. From my point of view I was doing okay and suddenly an important group at the upper right was dead. Where did I go wrong?

[Agi\] Hello, I'm Agilis of KGS, roughly 10k or so, and I'll be your reviewer for this game. I will be labeling my comments with this tag to help distinguish my comments from others.]

(;B[oe]TR[kc][lc][kd][ld]C[Is this a logical response? I was trying to focus everything on building a big moyo in the center. But looking at it now I think that maybe it's a bit slow.

[Agi\] I'm of the opinion that this is somewhat slow. It also does not particularly protect muct against a later invasion around the marked points should white build up some sort of position nearby. See variations for potential other responses.]
;W[rd]
(;B[fe]TR[fc]C[[Agi\] I can't help but believe that this move is too high and vague. An attempt at invading at the marked point, or nearby, seems possible. White would likely either live, or manage to slip away somehow. See Variations for possible other moves.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pj];B[pg]TR[pj]C[[Agi\] Pressing now, with the marked stone in existence, doesn't seem very effective. Even pushing would just help white secure the entire right side.]
;W[qg];B[oi]TR[fc][mc][oe][pg][jj][dl]C[[Agi\] With this move, are attempting to defend the center. However, this defensive mindset may prove to be your downfall. If white constantly can press your framework back, white is not only solidifying your framework, but developing the bottom as well.]

(;B[hb]C[[Agi\] Here you have stated your intentions to kill, or at least chase the white group. Another thing to consider is letting it live small.]
;W[ee];B[fd];W[dd];B[ed];W[de]
(;B[db]C[[Agi\] This seems to be a case of trying far too hard to kill. It should be enough to just separate the white stones, white staying very strong and alive all around. With white so weak, you want to give as few forcing moves as possible to seal the deal.]

;W[be];B[ci];W[gb];B[bb];W[kd]SQ[gc][gd][ge]C[[Agi\] Notice, black has in one sense, effectively driven white INTO the heart of his framework. Even worse, with the square marked wall, black is the one under attack on what was once friendly territory.]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[lc];W[jc];B[jb];W[jh];B[fi];W[me];B[jf]C[[Agi\] At this point white is very close to life or escaping.]

[Agi\] Final comments.

There are 2 things for black to remember.

1) It is usually risky to think of, and wield large frameworks as if they were territory. Defending one tends to start a vicious cycle of being squeezed down to nothing constantly while the other side builds up profit. The earlier you think about creating a large framework that territory, the earlier you become vulnerable to such squeezing.

2) Killing is very difficult. Sometimes, it just may be that you are forced to kill an invading group in an all-or-nothing fight, but oftentimes it is much simpler, and much much more profitable to either 1) let the invaders live, but small. or 2) chase the invader for profit, don't drive them into your formations like daggers.]

(;B[ra]LB[qa:1][sa:2]C[[Agi\] This would create 2 eyes for you unconditionally.]
;W[pb]C[[Agi\] All white can do here is get 1 point in sente.]
;B[pc];W[ga];B[oa];W[ia];B[ka];W[pd];B[pb];W[sc];B[sb]
(;W[sd]C[[Agi\] A rather humiliating life, but life nevertheless.]
)
(;W[lj]C[[Agi\] However, it may be too early to celebrate. The center is in grave danger. and there's very little room to run.]
)))
(;B[pe]C[[Agi\] this would actually work.]
(;W[oc]C[[Agi\] if white attemps to cut.];B[nb]LB[qb:B][nf:A]
C[[Agi\] these become miai to escape])
(;W[nf];B[oc]TR[kg][lh][nh][oi]SQ[kj][kk]C[[Agi\] And this fares slightly better for white. However, in this position, White has the chance to run down the board, and swallow the black stones in the center.]
)))
(;B[oc]C[[Agi\] it would be easier to just be secure.]))
(;B[fi]))
(;B[cc]C[[Agi\] For example, remaining very firm here, white needs to decide which group to try to save, at the expense of the other group]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[dg];W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[eg]C[[Agi\] If white hypothetically followed this line, saving one group. black profits all along the top. Walking along the 6th line can't be bad. In addition..]
;B[dh];W[gj];B[el]C[[Agi\] while white attempts to find safety somehow. Black gets a few free moves into white's framework.]
))
(;B[hd]C[[Agi\] It doesn't look like easy life for white in this tiny space. And even if it lives...]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[db];B[cb];W[dd];B[cc];W[ed];B[df]C[[Agi\] let's say you play really slack and let it live.]
;W[fb];B[da];W[eb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[hc];B[id];W[ea];B[jk]
C[[Agi\] now it has become that much more difficult for any other invaders to live in your framework.]
))
(;B[do]C[[Agi\] The bottom left corner is unfinished, and taking this area would do alot for both pressing white back, and expanding your own framework. Remember the principle, Corners first, then sides, finally center.]
)
(;B[pg]C[[Agi\] Pressing white down somewhat might work to extend your framework somewhat. However, it might be premature, as the lower left corner is more urgent.]
))
(;B[qh]TR[ic][cd][dj]C[[Agi\] A pincer might work well in this situation. With the black stones on the other side of the board, running isn't as easy for white, and black can profit from the exchange.]
;W[of];B[nd]C[[Agi\] Following one possible joseki, black cal profit while attacking.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[pj];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj];W[pk];B[ql]C[[Agi\] And white isn't settled yet.]
