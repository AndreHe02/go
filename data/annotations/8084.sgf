C[So, thanks for the review. I thought my opening was pretty decent, I thought I was playing well but at some point it all went downhill but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Did I spread myself too thin, read poorly, not cover myself, or a combination of things...?

Hi. I am Radu, I am playing mostly on LG and OGS where I place myself around 8-10 kyu.  So please consider my comments appropriate for such level. I will propose alternatives and things to think about. I hope you'll enjoy.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic]C[Tried a standard opening.

R: yeah, chinese fuseki. This stresses large moyos, specially on left and right side, with B expecting for W to invade in upper side, and using this invasion to build frames on lateral sides.]
(;W[qf];B[qh]C[R: good move. B puts pressure on W with this pincer]
;W[qd];B[qc]C[R: again , good move. Limits W in corner.];W[qe]
CR[rc]
(;B[ql]TR[qn]SQ[qh]CR[rc]C[Thought I could concede a bit of corner to make a base this side.

R: Well, I see this move like a undecided move. It tries to do much, but accomplish almost nothing. If it aims on approaching the bottom corner, it is a little to far to really count (W has triangle as answer). If it aims defending the pincer (square stone) it is too far, W has a very srtong move between them at R10. So it doesn't work well. Now, W got a powerful but yet lacking base group. B should put it on the run, esp considering W missed an important move: circle. See variation]
;W[qn];B[pj]SQ[ql]CR[rc]C[R: and now you see why square stone didn't helped a lot: B is overconcentrated and W has the chance to make room for his group in top]
(;W[og]C[R: this is a little to hasty for W. See variation]
;B[cn]TR[dj]CR[qh][pj][ql]C[R: thinking back to original opening, B aims for moyos on left side. If W insists on denying them, it ends up in a situation like on right side (if played corectly, B would already have a strong enclosed corner and a powerful group circles putting W on the run). So better for W to try to reduce instead of challenge this situation. 
As point on the board, B first aim should be D10, the central point in the opening. It makes the double wing formation and put extraordinarous pressure on W. The C6 kakari is good, if backed up by a very ambitious B play, in which B tries to push W even further. Now W has a pincer too good not to play and spoil B framework]
(;W[co]C[W misses it... too bad]
(;B[bo]C[R: wrong, the only answer is D6. See variation];W[bp]
;B[bm];W[dn];B[dm];W[en]TR[ci]C[And W again misses the vital point]
;B[dj]C[good, finally B makes the big step];W[cf]
(;B[ec]SQ[cd][ic]TR[gc]C[I would have choose the other side to defend: see variation. Because anyway circle stone doesn't completely link the square stones as W can invade at triangle. Again B will need another stone to protect this. And a double kakari is not something to be afraid of having this double wing formation and even more a pincer at C12. Moreover, C12 is both defeding the territory on the side and attacks the W kakary.]
;W[de]C[i guess I allowed him/her to easily split me there
R: If W had played 12, yes. Because W didn't, B has a second chance.]
;B[dd]TR[fd][ch][ee]C[C16 is in no danger, don't need to overconcentrate the power. Any triangle point can be considered]
;W[fe];B[ch]TR[gc]CR[ec]C[Good. Black seems to cope with big points after a while. Very good move, but while ago. Now G17 is too big to be missed. And this problem started basically with E17, circle stone: it wasn't linking really the B stones]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[eg]C[W misses the opportunity to take G17!];B[jp]
TR[nc][kc][gc][rc]CR[fq][nq]SQ[hq][lq]C[Looking now maybe I am spread too thin(?)
R: perhaps, but not sure. The big problem I see for B is that there are too many unsettled afairs on the board. W can go for any trianle points seriously damaging B frames. Because W can afford playing tenuki after B invasion, B K4 is not attacking (forcing) W in no sense. If B goes for any circle point, W answers with corresponding square move, as the corners are pretty powerful. So W can take the initiative]
;W[lq];B[gp]C[Good, keep 4th line to keep the center open.]
;W[fp];B[fq]C[Good, make hane];W[eq]
(;B[fr]C[Too small. I would go for variation.];W[er];B[fo];W[ep]
;B[gn]CR[ho][hq]C[This connection is larger, but presents the risk of W peeping at circles]
;W[fn];B[kq]SQ[lq][pp]LB[qj:1][gc:2][pc:3]C[I feel this move a little too close to W. It is virtually forcing W defends and link the square stones, making indestructible shape. B shouldn't provoke this, by no means. It is exactly what B did in the area 1 and didn't in the area 2 and 3]
;W[lp];B[jn];W[ln];B[mj]CR[qh][pj][ql]TR[om]C[Again, B feels the pitty of the 3 circle stones. The extension is too wide. Maybe a first approach at triangle followed by such extension would do the job.]
;W[jh]C[Should I have made myself more secure on the bottom first?]
;B[jk]TR[rc][nc][gd][lr][je]C[This is a kind of move which accomplishes too little. It doesn't attack. nor defends territory. B should have defended the weaknesses in the shapes or attack W.]
;W[fl];B[fj];W[dl];B[cl];W[em];B[cm]LB[qc:A][ic:B][hq:C][qe:D]
[df:E]C[Up to here I felt I had decent influence and some nice territory.
R: I would say W isn't so behind as territory. W has 12 points in lower left, 30 points in lower right. B has 12 points on left side, 12 points in upper left and 10 points on right side and 15 on bottom: 42 - 49. Most important, W puts pressure on B weaknesses (upper side is poor) while B is boxed by strong groups. B needs to settle the unfinished affairs soon or will see ruins around.
The problem with B is that the weakest groups A, B, C are facing stronger groups, while W weakest groups D and E are not under big pressure yet.]
;W[ao]C[B can ignore, small move];B[am];W[bn];B[dk];W[el];B[mc]
SQ[ic]TR[gd][kd]C[Another undecided move. It is good in the sens that offers to squar stone a miai after W attack: triangle moves.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[id]C[Good W sequence. It denies the miai as I said earlier.]
;B[gc]C[And B needs adding another stone to already concentrated group.]
;W[gd];B[me]CR[rc]C[The attack is too soon. First rob the W base, now W is forced to make a base.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[rc]C[And W does do the base.];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb]
TR[ob]C[Very poor connection. P18 is correct.And neither that required]
;W[an]LB[bj:1][cb:2][nb:3][rj:4][hq:5][br:6][pq:7][re:8][iq:9]
[hg:10]TR[hq][ho]SQ[fc][hc][kc]C[Very small. B can take a breath and count: 11 p at 1, 24p at 2, 10p at 3, 10p at 4, 15p at 9; W has 16p at 6, 30p at 7 and 7p at 8. B leads with 70 to 53. The peeps at the triangle points seems to be most dangerous, followe dby invasions at squares. 10 is big undecided area, who gets first to play G12 has a big advantage.]
;B[rm];W[qm];B[rl];W[pl];B[pk];W[nl]C[I guess I should have invaded his corner much sooner(?)
R: B has the monkey, so a corner invasion is still possible. Moves 79 and 81 were to small, B could play tenuki any of them and take G12]
(;B[ol];W[pm];B[nk]SQ[ol]C[A move with no big impact. Even if B looses marked stone, nothing happens. Other big points are waiting.]
;W[om];B[oh];W[mg];B[mh]SQ[hd][gh]C[Still too small compared with G12 or H15 for instance. This sequence was good in opening is B was first stealing the W base.]
;W[lh];B[li]SQ[jk]TR[ni][nh][ph][rh][rj]CR[mi]C[Wrong connection. Center stone can connect to any other group, while W has good attacking moves at triangles. B should have connected firmly.]
;W[kg];B[nh]C[Good.];W[ng];B[lk]TR[qq][sp][gh][hd][lr]C[B is continuing securing small amounts of territories while missing the bigger moves:]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[gq]CR[hl]C[Bitten by lack of security
R: one of them. But still W was in rush. W should have waited a little to put some stones in top (around circle) and after that B would hae been in great danger to be killed. Now B survives.]
(;B[gr]C[But not like this... B should have played like in variation.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[hr];B[iq];W[gs];B[ir];W[fs];B[kr];W[lr]
(;B[js]C[Oh, no/ B has already an eye there, even if W plays first. Connect toward center!]
;W[ko]CR[in][im][hm][il]C[W should have tried a larger cut.  One of the circle points maybe]
;B[jo];W[km];B[jm];W[ml]C[Again B can take initiative.];B[mk]
C[Nope, not yet.];W[ll];B[kl];W[kn];B[hl];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk]
;B[ik]C[Not as big as G12, not to mention that now even G13 available aiming of killing W group]
;W[hj];B[lf]C[This is a peep alright, but it accomplishes too little. It is more like loosing a ko threat]
;W[lg];B[kd]C[Yes, good move.];W[ke];B[le];W[kf]
(;B[lc]C[Hmm, I don't think it is required.];W[ij];B[jj];W[ii]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[gh]C[Now G13 is no longer available because W last 2 stones added]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[eh];B[fi]TR[ei]C[Why not triangle?];W[ei];B[ej]
;W[di];B[ci];W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[hi]TR[be][bh][rg][hd]C[Small move, right low corner is big. Othe big moves: triangles]

[sl][in][ho][io][ip][jq][jr]C[As far as I can see, there are no obvious mistakes. W and B lost some chances to score, but after a while the points were covered. 
The most important note I have on B plays is about undecided moves, avoid them. Moves like 11, 25, 27 or like 33, 51 and so. Choose your direction and goal and try accomplish. Of course great moves are the ones doing both attacking and defending, multi purpose moves. But these are by no means the ones in the middle. The multi purpose moves are like  hmmm, maybe 29 in some extent. One of most important such move would have been B playing S17 almost any time during the game.

Other notes on B play I would say:
- don't leave matters unsettled. As long as opponent group can be left without a base, do it right away. As lomg as your groups have serious weakness, protect them, if possible by attacking surrounding opponent stones
- when a lost is imminent, don't do it bigger, just try limit it
- try to see when solid connections are better than loose ones
- learn the benefit of monkey move: most of the time is correct
- learn simple openings not like sequence of moves but as learning it goals and try apply them stubbornly. Chinese fuseki is complicated one, but learning double wing formation from it would be a great benefit

Please consider my words as simple comments. I am open to any observation you would have and I will gladly try answer any of your questions]
