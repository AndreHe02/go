C[Game commentary by Pekka Karjalainen
(currently 15k* on IGS and 9k in Finland)

Requested by Raphael Quillaud (KIO).];B[pd];W[dp]C[This way white avoids an opening where black takes the opposite corners.]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[Both sides have made a common opening pattern by taking two star points on the same side.

When you place a stone on the star point you are not securing the corner.  In fact it takes two more moves to completely take control of the territory there, which means you should look towards the outside instead.  Good follow-up moves are long extension
s down the side and approach plays backed up by the star point stone.

In an opening like this that means the emphasis should be on the outside and the center.  Let's see how that works out...]
;B[ci]C[In the more usual lines of play black makes a san-rensei by playing at Q10 or approaches at F17 instead.  Here he ignores his first two moves, but this move is not really bad either, since it stops white from making a large framework of his own.

When splitting the opponents position, the middle is often the best choice. however.  Here it would mean C10 for black instead of C11.]

(;W[qn]C[Now things turn interesting.  Please go back and study the variations first.

Generally one shouldn't always respond to the opponent's moves, but early in the opening that does keep the game a lot simpler.
  Later black gets a strong position on the left because white chose this way of playing and the game becomes very complicated  for me to analyse.

Considering the stone at D4 approach at O3 would make more sense.  If black has the chance to take K3 or K4 now (could even be next move), the stone at D4 is left with nowhere to go, except the corner.  Its original purpose was to look toward the outside,
 so this is not good for white.];B[cn];W[fp]C[Sensible choice.  Please note the discussion of black H3 later  and consider F3 as another possibility.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[This is a basic joseki and neither side should have cause for complaint locally.

I like black's move at D8 very much.  Not only does it prevent white invasion, it also makes a very strong, thick shape.  The stone at D16 is affected very much by this.]

(;W[pj]C[Interesting.  I have given a short analysis of the whole board situation in the previous variations.  Considering that, this move will be very effective if black responds to it.

But does he have to?  I said that R6 would make the opening very complicated...]
;B[qh]C[This is not a bad response locally, but in this situation the lone black stone at Q4 should be given a lot of consideration.  Also, black has the moves at H3 and F17 mentioned earlier.]
;W[pf]C[The double approach move at O3 would be even stronger now. This move pales in comparison, but black makes a mistake which gives white a good result anyway.]

(;B[oh]C[Please go back and see the variation.  I cannot understand what black is thinking here, since one the the fundamental rules of good go is keeping your stones connected.  R14 should not be pondered over, black should not hesitate - it should be on the bo
ard in an instant!];W[nf]C[Black could still connect at R14.  Perhaps black P12 could be excused in light of this.]
;B[nd]C[Instead, this is what happens.  It is perhaps a natural answer to white O14, but black forgets about connecting his stones.  All the trouble he runs into is a result of this simple mistake.]
;W[on]C[While this move removes the possibility of the double approach, it makes a good shape for the coming fight on the right side.  Black still could connect and try to live in the corner after white O4 - perhaps a better result for him than in the game itse
lf.];B[np]C[A natural answer.  But white goes into action...]
;W[qe]C[This is most probably the best move in this position.  Black cannot connect anymore and his two stones will come under attack.  Such oversights should be punished and white is doing exactly that.

Also, white can slide to S17 next to establish a base for his group.]
;B[nj]C[Here comes black, jumping boldly with a knight's move.  Now is the time to stop and think about the next move.  This kind of a fight can easily decide the outcome of an entire game.]

(;W[nk]C[Please go back and see the variation for some analysis of the situation.  This move is not very good, since black can turn the tables with the correct response.]

(;B[mh]C[Black has a better way to play than this.  Please check the variation.]
;W[oi]C[This does not seem too bad, but considering what both players did miss just a few moves ago, it is hard for me to evaluate.]
;B[cf]C[The earlier discussion of the approach on the other side should make it clear that this way of playing is less than optimal for black.]
;W[gd]C[I have not seen this longer extension before.  I think it is not so good, because black gains more potential forcing moves, threatening to cut the connection.]
;B[fe]C[Like this.  But the problem with this move is that it is on the wrong side.  I would have expected to see black E17 or F17 instead.]
;W[fd];B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ed]C[White's play is correct.  He makes a territory on the fourth line - the line of victory - while black's gains do not seem that big.]
;B[bd]C[This is big, but white can ignore it, since it does not have any strong follow-up move.  The fight on the right side is still going on, so this can be considered a mistake from black.]
;W[ph]C[And white sensibly turns to play there first.];B[pg]
;W[pi];B[og];W[qg];B[of]C[This is not bad for white, as mentioned earlier in the variation where it cropped up.

Considering that black no longer has F17 to play next, his wall is not as effective as it would have been earlier.]
;W[jq]C[This is good, completing the joseki shape and protecting against black H3.]
;B[jc]C[A response of similar value.  This does redeem black's wall a bit after all, but now the lower right corner seems all too lonely again.]

(;W[mq]C[It is of course the right thing to attack black since he is weak, but this is not the best way.  Please go back to see the variations.]
;B[nq];W[mr];B[nr]
(;W[ig]C[Please see the variation before this move.  This move is not in the wrong direction, but there is something that could be done first.]
;B[jp];W[ip]C[This invites a cross-cut, which turns out to favor black.]
;B[iq]C[Here he comes.  Maybe he should not have done that - white can get a good result.]

(;W[io]C[This follows the proverb that says to extend from a cross-cut.  However, please go back and see the variation.  The direction turned out to be just a little bit wrong and black managed to gain more than he should have.]
;B[kq]C[After this black move, the outcome is forced.];W[jr]
;B[kp];W[hq];B[ir];W[is];B[kr];W[hr]C[Cross-cuts can seem bewildering to a beginner, but they need not be. If you still feel that they are difficult, you should study them and try out all the different variations patiently.   After a while, you can read the  variations with greater and greater ease while playing.  That helps in becoming stronger, too.]
;B[mp]C[Black is being very thorough in capturing the white stones.  This stops white from forcing with N5, but that is not a big loss for white - perhaps black was being too careful considering several moves that could be made elsewhere.]
;W[qd];B[qc]C[Some more points for white in sente.];W[rp];B[qq]
C[And some more, again in sente.  Good moves to make, these two.]
;W[jb]C[This move is really odd.  Black misses a good chance to punish it.]

(;B[kc]C[Wrong way, black!  Please see the variation for the right black move.]
;W[ic];B[kb];W[hb]C[White managed to get a good result.  Black missed a good chance here ang the game looks quite even again.]
;B[fg]C[Perhaps black is a little ahead.  I get about sixty points for both now with maybe five more for black. That is just counting already secured territory though, whatever should become of the center is just too hard for me to guess yet.]
;W[ni]C[This move isn't bad by any means.  Using the potential of the white stone at O14 is the best thing to do right now.  E7 or thereabout would also be big for both sides.]
;B[nh];W[mj]C[This does not look so big at to me.  Black should be happy to take L13 now.

Note however that if black had omitted the slow move number 59 at N4, the forcing move at N5 would now be quite big.
 That black move does have some merits too.];B[ke]C[All too shy from black.  He is strong all around, so why not L13?]
;W[kg]C[Very good - this is what black overlooked with his last move.]
;B[mf];W[pe];B[od];W[oe]C[The last two moves by white are certainly sente, but they are very small in value.  They are something that should be left as ko-threats instead.]
;B[ne]
(;W[gh]C[This doesn't look so good.];B[fh]C[Black has a simple and effective response.]
;W[gi];B[fi]C[Trying to take territory in the center doesn't usually work in a situation like this.  Black does miss one or two crucial moves, which lets white get more than is to be expected.]
;W[lh]
(;B[rf]C[Please go back and see the variation for what black should have done in the center.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[sf];B[re];W[rd];B[se];W[sd];B[sg];W[qf];B[rc]
;W[sf]C[It was close, but white managed to keep his own.];B[sc]
C[Black managed to take the corner territory in sente.  All those moves inside white's territory were answered, so he did not really take a loss.]

(;W[sh]C[This may not be necessary.  Of course, during a game it is wiser to err on the side of caution, unless behind, but after the game these kinds of defensive moves should be analysed.  It helps to find places where you are too cautious.

Please go back to study the variation.

However, I am not urging you to be careless.  If you are not sure about your stones' safety and can take the time to defend, just do so!]
;B[si];W[ri];B[sg];W[qi];B[ln]C[Again, black makes a shy move.  He could jump to L7 or L8 instead.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[ll];B[nm];W[om];B[ml]C[That is too small.  White has made a nice framework in the center, and if he can turn it into territory, the game will be a sure win for him.]
;W[lk];B[nl];W[fk]C[Excellent.];B[ek];W[fm];B[fj];W[gk];B[gj]
;W[hj]C[Correct moves for white.  Black really missed an opportunity here and white managed to take territory in the center.]
;B[ol];W[pl];B[ok];W[pk];B[mk];W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[ee]
;B[ef];W[ge];B[gf];W[jd];B[kd];W[je];B[mi]C[Finally black took it.  Did you notice you could have taken this spot and threaten to capture black with a snap-back?

A snap-back is a situation where the opponent may capture your stone (or stones), but after doing so his stones remain in atari and can be captured during the next move.  In this situation black should have defended at M13 immediately after white N11.  Pl
ease verify this if you did not notice it.];W[lj];B[li];W[ki]

;B[fl];W[gl];B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[ks];B[ls];W[lr]C[This is the only mistake white makes in the endgame, and even here there is really no loss.

I am no expert at endgame theory however, which is a more advanced subject...]
;B[lq];W[js];B[ms];W[do];B[dn];W[en];B[gm];W[po];B[oo];W[no]
;B[op];W[nn];B[mn];W[gg];B[ff];W[hf];B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[ie]
;B[mo];W[jo];B[ko];W[cp];B[bo];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[sq];W[sp]
;B[sr];W[oj]C[Well, perhaps this should have been at A16, which is bigger than this.  Not a big deal with the lead white has in points.]
;B[mm];W[nk];B[eo];W[fn];B[fo];W[gn];B[go];W[hn];B[ep];W[eq]
C[Here black probably resigned.  White has a lead of about 25 points so black cannot do anything anymore.

Overall, I liked white's playing and there were only a few outright mistakes I could spot.  The opening was not really wrong, but it was a bit strange and too complicated.  I would recommend trying to keep things simple in the opening.

Often beginning players feel that they must immediately play between the opponents stones whenever things look like he could make a bigger framework somewhere.  As they gain more experience they find that such a stone is a marvelous target for an attack a
nd learn of the risks of playing such moves.

To get an idea consider the black stone at C11.  It was move number five and the first variations dealt with harassing it a bit.  You did not do it and now it sits in the center of a huge territory.

Compare this with the prospects black had in the variation I said was better for white.  The difference is striking.  Also, consider the white upper left corner and contrast it with the other early variation where black plays at F17.

Now black's stones can only run away.  Chasing them will not only be fun, but extremely profitable as well.

In analysing this situation I found that without white R10 black had plenty of opportunities to attack white severely.  Good defense before offense is often very wise in go.]

(;W[jq]C[This completes the joseki for white.  If white lets black play at H3 before this, his stones will have trouble developing further from the corner.
 It would have been hard to find a good reply to black H3 without a move like this, since black could have
  slid under white's corner position or escaped into the center.

But, this move would let black to put his strong position to use with the following sequence.]
;B[fc]C[The approach here follows the basic principle of go regarding strong positions; drive the opponent towards your thickness (i.e. a strong position).  The strength of the black's left side really comes to its own as white must be wary of coming under seve
re attack.];W[ec];B[fd];W[cf]C[Perhaps white will want to secure himself quickly.  These moves indeed do that...]
;B[jd]C[... but black gets the ideal move at K16.  White is falling behind quite badly.

To prevent it, white could play at F17 or C14 first, or even extend to K17 - though then black will have no trouble playing at F17 anyway.    The reinforcement leaves black with H3 instead.  Such are the troubles caused by move 6 at R6.  To be fair, it must also be considered that the move at R6 helps white to eventually claim the right side as territory.

However, white has other options for move 11.  Please see the other variation.]
)
(;W[nq]C[It seems like white cannot reinforce both the top and the bottom at the same time (as noted in the other variation).  Seems like he is in trouble, but there is a way out.  Taking the initiative with the double approach helps forestall black's attackin m
oves.

This is the move I would prefer in this position.];B[oo]C[Black had better get out while it is possible.  If white were to enclose him in the corner, it would be more than adequate comparison for black's attack on the upper left corner (given in the other variation).]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[Blocking at this side seems better.  Just reverse the resulting shape and consider black's position to see why Q3 does not seem attractive.]
;W[pq];B[mo];W[lp]C[This is a joseki.  Now, that does mean it is white's only choice, but it is a plausible way of playing - at least to me.]
;B[qj]C[Now white has lessened the impact of H3 and has sente to reinforce the top left corner.  Black looks like he is making a big framework, but with the potential of the stone at R6 to help white should have no great trouble of keeping it in control.    At least I would feel confident, maybe you would prefer a different way of playing considering your own strengths and preferences.]
