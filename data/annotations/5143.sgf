(;W[mc]LB[nc:A][po:B]C[>>White O17 makes more sense because black r14 is a small knight approach.

Popular plays that I've seen are either  

-white O17, then black will make mini chinese at R9 or corner enclosure around R6  

Or
- White approaches at Q5 to prevent moyo and black will double approach at the top at O17 or  pincer white around Q8

See variation];B[qk];W[eq];B[gq]CR[iq]LB[ep:A][jq:B]C[Now I am thinking G3 and Q3 are both low and may not be suitable.

>> so I guess you played black. 

I think G3 puts more pressure on white, although wider pincer like J3 also makes sense if you want to make moyo with the right side. 

If I were white, I'd prefer high approach at E4 or loose invasion at K3 because white will have more flexibility.]

(;W[co]LB[fo:A]C[This  I think is incorrect.  Not joseki.

>> you're probably right it's difficult to save E3 group.

I think white's attitude is not good here. when White played a knight move like D5 it's inviting a cut, white shouldn't try to save the stones on both sides. 
Let black have one side and white takes the other.  

White at disadvantage after this fight.];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[cn]

you should make the fight spread to the top so white top area will disappear, i think black is much better.]

(;B[bs]C[This would live, and makes the game less volatile.  Would you have played here, or tried to kill white?

>> this is ok, it's pretty much sente, if white doesn't answer black can capture E1 group easily and white is not alive down in the bottom.

Black's strategy here should be confining white to the bottom side. never let white come out at K3 like what happened in the game.  Living on a 2nd line this early in the game is already very bad for white]
