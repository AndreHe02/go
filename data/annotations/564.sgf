 Brahms 3k : is entering byo-yomi
reid: this invasion feels like it might be a bit too early.  up to
this point, both sides have played very reasonable moves, but
i think white would like to play something on the right side now.
black would feel pretty good if he can get a low approach on the
right side before white can defend there.]WL[21];B[cj]BL[600]

 sbc 3k*: is entering byo-yomi
reid: this is a bit slow, i think.  the usual guideline is to make
territory first in the corners, next on the sides, and last in the center.
if h14 is sente, then black can think about playing it now, but since
white has already played h16, h14 has little affect on white.
I think a move around a (r9) is more urgent.]BL[568];W[bk]C[reid: this is very big, and well timed.  after black has played h14, he
is practically forced to answer b9.]WL[590];B[bj]BL[555];W[cb]
C[reid: still not the biggest area, I think.  white is already alive
here, so this is not particularly urgent.]WL[581];B[eo]BL[550]
;W[ep]WL[577];B[gn]BL[550];W[pf]WL[548];B[nc]BL[542];W[ij]WL[521]

;B[nh]BL[486];W[pc]C[reid: hmmm, white is trying to save two week groups.  this looks
like a good chance for black.]WL[420];B[pd]LB[pb:A]C[reid: if black wants to try to kill white on a large scale, he should
play underneath at a (q18) instead.  q16 is an attempt to divide and
conquer, but in this case, white is already divided (the l11 group) so
I think black should play patiently: fortifying his positions, and let the
splitting attack develop at its own pace.]BL[484];W[qd]C[reid: white takes advantage of black q16 and plays lightly (sabaki).]
WL[418];B[od]BL[461];W[rc]WL[408];B[qb]BL[460];W[rb]WL[405]
;B[qe]BL[442];W[rd]WL[403];B[lj]C[reid: now that white has settled the s16 group, he'll have a much easier time
saving these stones.   black seems to be behind on territory, so he must go
all-out to kill them.  not a good position for black now.]BL[340]
;W[qg]C[reid: whoa!  this move is not at all urgent.  white should only be thinking
about dealing with his center stones.]WL[397];B[kg]C[reid: this is probably where white should have played instead of r13.  the
game shifts back to black's favor.]BL[324];W[in]WL[387];B[ip]
LB[io:A][im:B]C[reid: this seems to be a leaning attack, but in this case, white might
ignore the potential loss on the lower side and try to save his center
stones.  I think black should play at a (j5) or b (j7) instead.]
BL[318];W[gm]C[reid: the position becomes difficult, but that is what white wants.  if he can
create enough confusion, he'll have a good chance to save his center stones.]
WL[373];B[ho]BL[314];W[gj]WL[296];B[fm]LB[co:A][cm:B][il:C]
C[reid: this move blocks any chance of white connecting through black's thin
position, but perhaps black can accomplish the same thing by playing a (c5)
and b (c7).  white will probably answer both giving black time to attack with
a move like c (j8)]BL[310];W[fl]WL[283];B[em]C[reid: if white lives in the center (and that's starting to look pretty likely)  all the black stones around f7 and e7 will just be dame points.]
BL[281];W[gg]WL[267];B[hg]BL[275];W[hh]WL[262];B[gi]C[reid:  black h13 and g11 help white build an eye.]

BL[562];W[dh]C[reid: white is ahead - but now he's giving black a chance to
create complications.  black might push down at a (e17) grabbing
a big corner and setting up a future attack on the h16 group.]

left, but he lost more that that in the corner and top side.]
WL[411];B[nn]C[reid: this is very slow.  it only gains a couple of points around n5.
black might want to think about things like the 3-3 invasion at r3
and the descent to s11.  if black is going to take gote, the biggest
is probably h3.]BL[486];W[hq]C[reid: big, but still gote. p2 or o2 looks bigger.]

and get two eyes instead.  (if black answers at b (l16), white plays
c (l14).  if black tries anything else, white d (j15) is sente.)]
