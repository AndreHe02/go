C[Hi Zac, My name is Guillaume. I'm glad to be your reviewer for this game. As per your request, I'll review for white.
Before I start, I noticed you didn't ask questions. Note that it would be better for future reviews requested at GTL to ask specific questions along the game. It does help the reviewer to focus on elements of interest for you. It request a little bit of time but you're the one benefiting from it afterwards.
That being said, let's start.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj]
;W[di];B[jd];W[jq]C[I would personnally prefer to either enclose or approach a corner. Here, you don't apply much pressure to black who keeps the initiative even if you played in the wider area which is a good rule of thumb.]
;B[cd];W[cf]LB[cc:A][dd:B]C[This seems a strange response to the black stone. Facing this kind of shoulder hit (which I've just learnt from Sensei's Library could be called an armpit hit (http://senseis.xmp.net/?ArmpitHit), you should extend either at A or B.]

(;W[nc]LB[ch:A]C[This is maybe your first big mistake in the game. You cannot tenuji in this situation.
your group at A is weak, you have to defend it and you need as well to threaten this invader at C7.]
;B[oc];W[kc]LB[oc:B][nd:A]C[I still would emphasize the weakness of your group at C12 overall but locally speaking, you need to play the iron pillar at A. By shape, that's the only response to the kick at B. What you built with this extension is not a solid base because the stone at O17 is weakened by the contact play.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[nb];W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[kd];W[qn]TR[nc][ld][md]
[nd]C[This is exactly the same mistake as the one you made at O17. You're moving away from the main area of operation : your marked group is weak : you cannot let it down. If black plays around N15, he will chase it all over the board and even if he doesn't kill it, he would make territory in the process while White would only run for survival.]
;B[qo];W[pn]C[Good iron pillar... I believe it's the only move in this situation.]

(;W[pl];B[qk];W[op];B[oq];W[oo]LB[pl:A][op:B]C[Those 2 contact plays are really helping a lot Black to make territory. It seems better just to jump away. There is a proverb that says "one-point jump are never bad).]

(;W[po];B[qp];W[or]LB[nq:A][mr:C][nr:B]C[This is unrealistic : in the sequence to C, White ends up with 3 liberties vs. two groupes with more than 4 liberties.]
;B[nq];W[nr];B[mr];W[sq]C[This is unrealistic to kill this black group, once black cuts, it still has more liberties than the 4 white stones.]

;B[fn]
(;W[lp]LB[md:B][ch:A][pn:C]C[Another unappropriate tenuki. Black is making a threat at F6 which  needs to be answered. Still, I understand the feeling that the white gorup at S6 is in danger. In fact, at this stage, White is juggling with 3 weak groups (at A, B and to some extend C which still doesn't have 2 eyes) while all of black's are stable, safe and sound. As a result, Black can attack not necessarily to kill but to threaten to and make territory in the process.]

[es][fs][gs][hs]C[This loss at the end is not so big: you lose 2 stones and 4 points of territory for a total of 6 points. That being said, the game looks indeed look hard : you still have the weak group at R6 to take care of at this stage (may not live).
Maybe you could have a last try at invading the upper right corner but the space is very small for it : it's most likely too late already.

So, to sum it up :
1. Based on this game, the most important thing for you to work on to become stronger is to defend your weak groups and avoid tenuki if your groups don't have a base or safe access to the center (if a base is not anymore possible). It may seem passive but actually it prevent the opponent to obtain a lot of free moves in the process of attacking your stones.
2. Remember the meeting point strategy : if there are 2 weak groups on the board, play at the meeting point of the 2 weak groups (example : C9 at move 30), if there is 1 weak group and 1 moyo, play at their intersection (to defend the weak group and limit the moyo), if there are 2 moyos, play at their intersection (example: D5 at move 72 where the first player to take the point will take the advantage over the other). Those are good rules of thumb to choose where to play in the mid-game.
3. Study shape : some moves should be almost automatic : iron pillar when kicked on the 3rd line, 1-point jump to get out in the open, 1 point jump from a surrounded 3 points wall (key point), extend from a diagonal contact play on the 3rd and 4th line. I really shouldn't say automatic (as it''s never good to play on auto-pilot), but let's say that you need good reasons to disregard such moves). 
Another comment : both you and your opponent did play 2-points jump extensions on the 3rd line in the purpose of making base but those extension were not working anymore because there were opponent stones in contact or diagonal position to either of the 2 stones. In such case, it's better to avoid going that close even if it means making a smaller extension. 

Hope this helps. Please feel free to let me know if you have questions.]
