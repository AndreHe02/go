C[Hi, Barry, I will analyze this game. Hope it will be helpful.]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd];W[nc];B[qf];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq];B[oc]C[This move (rightly) gets no response - should I close the corner at P4 instead?

Jay: This is a bit slow, since W played tenuki here, meant at developing a fast game. P4 is a good idea or K4 feels right.]
;W[op]
(;B[mq]C[Is this a bad choice of joseki? Should I R6 instead, and play the left side after the joseki ends?

Jay: This is ok in my book. R6 is not right. It looks to concentrated on the right.]

;W[qo];B[mr];W[no];B[mp];W[ce]C[What is the best direction here?

Jay: Up to this point, W is a little better, due to better effeciency. The LL corner is the only open area. But C5 a too low. D5 is better.]
(;B[co];W[dl];B[fo];W[gq];B[dj];W[fl];B[cg]C[Should I jump again from F5 instead?

Jay: This is fine, but B is in for a tough fight, since this only helps W's top form a large territory through attacking B's weaks groups. The problem started with C5 F5 combo joseki, that helps W.]

C[This seems very bad in retrospect - I presume I should play something like E13?

Jay: Yes, this is away from the main battle ground, E13 is a must.]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[go];B[fn];W[eg];B[dh]C[Jay: B's game is developing badly here.]

;W[an];B[am];W[qi]C[What is the best response to this move? Is it possible to pincer at R9?

Jay: R9 is not good move. W would swallow the stone and form a large territory. The game move is actually not bad.]
;B[oi];W[oj]
(;B[pj]C[Jay: This is too aggressive. The fighting is not good for B.]
;W[pi];B[pk];W[pf];B[nj]C[Is R13 better?

Jay: This has no choice but fight after Q10. But the result is not good for B.]

(;W[rg]C[Jay: This is not the right move, B was lucky here.]
;B[oe];W[rd];B[of];W[re];B[rc];W[ph];B[rj];W[ri]C[Jay: Now W's gain is minimal. B has caught up a bit in the game, since B protected the UR corner with minimal loses, while boke up the potential W's territory on the right.]

;B[nm]C[Jay: B should save s9 stones, to make Q11 group weak.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ln];B[gc]C[Is this the right area to play in? I considered L15 to neutralise the aji of white putting the o17 stone in motion but it seemed like white's top left could get quite big then.

Jay: This is a biggest point on the board. Both sides played some small moves in N6 area. Finally, B took this big point.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[jd];B[ib];W[ie];B[hc]C[After this I was in byo-yomi and stopped recording.  Shortly after this white moves out with O17 and succeeds in splitting the top side.  Nothing dies but he wins by 16.5.

Jay: B is still behind up to now. There must be some technical mistakes by B for W to save O17 stone. Maybe B realize being behind, and played very aggressive. The game is quite tough for B.]
;W[fm];B[en];W[gn]C[Jay: The center's has lots of points for W, hard for B. The game went badly at the beginning, although B caught up a bit, but not enough to win.]
