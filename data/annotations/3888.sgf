alaric: Hello, I'm alaric and I'll be doing your review today.  I'm 15k KGS.  All my comments will be proceeded by "alaric:".  I don't presume you know the japanese terms for various things, so I add anglicized versions whenever I first use a term.  If you already know these definitions then ignore my parenthetical commentary.  If you want to know more about a certain word or topic I would suggest Sensei's Library (http://sensei.xmp.net).  One last caveat, all comments through the eyes of a 15k, feel free to ignore what I say when I'm wrong.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[qf];B[nd]LB[nc:A]C[alaric: I I'd rather just go with the knights move at A (O17).  At this point in the game I'd rather settle my stones so that I could quickly begin an assault on the weak white positions that innevitably come out of a handicap game, the one-point extension leaves your west flank in the air.]
;W[rd];B[pj]LB[qc:A][dj:B]SQ[nd][pd]C[alaric: I don't agree with this.  White is offering you half the NE corner, I think it's better to just take it with A (R17).  Your move leaves the marked group open to assault.  Furthermore I don't think it works well as an attack.  If you are trying to split the white stones then a play on the 3rd line (R10) would probably have been better (or maybe a tight pincer on the lone white stone at R8).  If white approaches you can make the 1-point jump to P10, or if white tries to cap at P10 you can make a strong diagnal move at Q9.  If you are going to tenuki (Play away from the current tactical battle) I would prefer to play at B (D10).]
;W[qc]C[alaric: White takes the corner, settles his NE group, and retains sente (initiative, or the ability to play where you wish), basically all he could ask for.]
;B[pc];W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[pi];W[pl];B[pg]LB[ol:A]C[alaric:  I  presume your intentions here are to build a strong wall with alot of influence.  This move isn't sente because both white groups are fairly well settled.  This allows white to continue it's stretch towards some influence with the gap in the SE.  Maybe A (P8)?]
;W[ol];B[nk]C[alaric: Look at the moves up until now from whites point of view.  He has managed to secure a decent chunk of terrority, leave no weak groups, and retain sente.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[cf];B[fd]C[alaric: I don't like this move.  This begs for white K17.  If black takes either of the maia  (points of equal value such that if black plays one white can still play the other) white can extend in sente, since the extension threatens to slide under your 4th line stones and destroy the northern territory (For example WK17, BH17, WN17).]
;W[bd];B[dj]C[alaric: If it was worth doing once.....

I think taking the big point (K16, K4), securing the corner and your group (C17), or attacking the weak stone (C8 Pincher) are all better than this.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[bp];B[jq]C[alaric: I think this could be played on the 4th line.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[bk]C[alaric: Not as large as K17.];B[cp]C[alaric: smallish, but a fairly good sequence that builds a black wall facing the long black extension down the southern side of the board.]
;W[bq];B[co];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm];B[cj]C[alaric: I'm not sure what the purpose of this move is.  Both white groups in the west are secure, so splitting them doesn't help.  If the plan is to strengthen D10, it would be better to also help build influence (since you have built your entire game around it so far).  K16 is large at this point.  There is also K5 to help build moyo and increase influence, and R5 to take the corner.]
;W[bj]C[alaric: White would do better to tenuki here I believe.]
;B[dg]C[alaric: Probably a little overambitious, two stones are really needed to seal that area off.  Also it would probalby be better to try this in the south (for example at D8) because there is a better framework already in place.]

[rm][sm][an][bn][rn][sn][ao][so][ap][aq][ar]C[this was THE GAME LOOSING MOVE i guess.
if i had played it on C11 instead of making a solid connection at D11, it would have been sente.
next i would have been able to play at K17 as did White the next move.
i really guess that with K17 in place i didnt have had to face any complications at all as i should have been easily able to to convert most of the triangled areas to territory amking at least around 110 points vs around under 50 points for White on the crossed areas. besides my influence would have been controlling the whole lower center.
but....

alaric: I don't think any single play caused you to lose the game.  C11 isn't sente, white can ignore and if you push to B11 he can play B12.  You had a couple of oppurtunities to play K16, but even after the invasion you still had a solid chance at victory.]

[sm][an][bn][rn][sn][ao][so][ap][aq][ar]C[this is what happened :(
my position in the lower right corner Q16 and so turned from ok to not so good and i lost grip on the lower side. actually loosing around 30 points]
;B[jd]LB[lc:A]C[alaric: I don't care for this. I'd rather take A (M17) to secure your NE group while weakening whites base.  You have two nice strong walls on either side, so white is forced to choose either living small on the side, and in the process giving you a third wall toward some really impressive moyo, or fleeing towards a very hostile center where you will gain profit from the attack even if he finds a way to live.]
;W[kd];B[kc]LB[je:A]C[alaric: I don't like the crosscut here.  White gets first shot at determing which side he wants to come out on.  You've got a dangerous gap between the two black groups on the right, neither one of which is totally secure yet, that you need to be mindful of.  Instead maybe extend to A (K15)?  Aiming to turn that left wall into profit.]
;W[lc];B[ic]LB[kb:A]C[alaric: Probably better to extend, the atari here just strengthens whites position.]
;W[jb];B[ke];W[ld];B[ie]SQ[pc][nd][pd]C[alaric: Nice shape by white, one eye fairly secure and still has sente, the marked stones now also need to connect.]
;W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]LB[le:A]C[alaric: White can live easily now, best now is to extend at A (M15) trying to connect to your NE group while continueing to wall off the center territory.]
;B[gb];W[le]C[alaric: Now white threatens both the NE group and the center, you'll lose one or the other.]

LB[dl:A]C[alaric: Overplay, the simple move A (D8) is better.]
;B[dl];W[dk]LB[cl:A]C[alaric: White throws good stones after bad, A (C8) is better.]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[fl];W[rp];B[qd]C[alaric: Go proverb: "If you have lost all 4 corners, resign".  As with all proverbs, the validity in any given case can be questioned, but I think it's quite valid in this case.  You started with a 4 stone handicap and continually favored influence over territory. So white now controls 4 corners, one solid side, and one not-so-solid side.  That's alot of territory to overcome.]
;W[rc];B[qe];W[re];B[qi];W[qg];B[qh];W[pq];B[oq];W[qq];B[ha]
LB[lh:A][kk:C][nl:B]C[alaric: Did you read this as a killing move?  If so that is fine, but if not then this can only be either 1) A thank you move, you force white to live and he thanks you for it, or 2) An endgame move played to early.  There are still big moves on the board, any of M12, O8, or L9 would be good right now.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[nm];B[pn]LB[kl:A]C[alaric; To greedy, white is already out, best now to try to protect your center moyo with something around L8.]
;W[po]C[alaric: White trying to get to fancy I think, better to simply play Q7 and connect.]

;B[ig];W[jg];B[jf];W[li];B[hg]C[luckily enough i was able
to stop his incurvings with Black136. but...

alaric: I think you did quite well.  Alot of built up aji, but other than that you have secured alot of center territory, although your NE group is cut off now.]
;W[oc]C[next Whit started to attack my corner group
by threatening a cut and reducing my mobility for the whole lower right  side]
;B[od];W[nc];B[pb]C[i decided NOT to play the safe move on P12,
but sought some more points. but that meant a desperate fight for live

alaric: Play the urgent play before the big play.  Note that even after P12 the eye at P13 and/or O14 are false eyes, you still need to make a second eye on the side.]
;W[oh]C[of course i got struck right in the heart as expected

alaric: Risking the 60 or so points your black group is worth versus the handful of points you could spoil with Q18 isn't worth it.  My score estimator shows you up by 48 if your group lives.  This against someone you are taking a handicap against, better to take the safe play here.]
;B[ni]C[alaric: Do not go on a tilt and throw good stones after bad.  If you have a stragey you believe will work that is fine, but don't fight to the death simply to do it.]

;W[rj];B[mf];W[ph];B[oi];W[sf];B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[kb]C[at this point i realized that due to the crowded situation if at all i could only live in seki as whit did not have safe eys at all, too

alaric: good vision to see the possibilities, and well done in making it happen, it could well have turned the game around.]
;B[of];W[pg];B[nb];W[ob];B[oa];W[nf];B[sh]C[my two dead stones now perfectly lay in position for the dual purpose of Black168]
;W[qm];B[sg];W[qb];B[of];W[rf];B[nf]C[this way i could connect easily amking my plans at least theoretically possible]

;B[cb]C[starting here...];W[bb]C[...];B[cd]C[...];W[bc]C[...ending up in got in that state of the game...]
;B[db]C[this was acually a lame sequence for me.
i think i should have extended Black28 to the top(D3) or try an atari at F5

alaric: Probably not the best move at this point, I like the almost sente P2, which threatens the monkey jump to S1, and the the same time helps solidify the SE a bit. Also the reverse sente D2 (which again is almost sente, instead of the gote C2).]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fr];W[ee];B[de];W[eg];B[ff];W[gh];B[fi]
;W[lq]C[this was unluckily unexpected but decently strong as it made me worry about the Whitecutting stones entangled all around

alaric:  There are two main ways for white to live in this position, to connect out to the right, or to win a capture race with your SE shape.  So attempt to attack the invasion stone while defending your group.]
;B[lo]SQ[mm][nm]C[i decided to try something strange as i wanted to inhibit any possible linkup

alaric: maybe threaten to linkup undernearth with N2, then a move like this, both of which give shape to your SE group so it could live even if the white stone connects to the marked stones.]
;W[kp]C[...naturally followed];B[jo]SQ[lo][jq]C[alaric: I don't like this formation (the triangle of marked stones), because if white plays in it's center then you'll get cut in one direction.   In this case you are basically pre-cut by playing after the fact.  Either F5 or G5 blocks any attempt for white to reach the SW formation, better to form a solid connection.  I would go with either N4 or H3 here.  Either one settles one side fairly well, so presume he will go the other direction.]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[kq];B[hq]C[i guess this on J2 would have been better

alaric: Maybe better to extend and K2 and force white to fight harder for the capture.  He will definately get one eye out of it, so you need to make sure you cut him off and don't let him get a second.]
;W[ir];B[ko];W[mp];B[mo];W[np];B[no]C[alaric: This must be at P4 instead, now W P4 secures the group and captures alot of territory.  The white group will likely live during the capture race that would follow, but it would live small, unlike here.  The game is very close at this point, with a limited number of endgame points remaining.]
;W[op];B[mq]C[that was obsolete i should have blocked elsewhere or crawled into enemy territory

;B[is];W[ls];B[ds];W[es];B[fs];W[js];B[na];W[la];B[fg]SQ[ce]
[ci]C[alaric: don't protect weak points unless you have read out the moves and there is a legitimate threat.  This is -1 point in gote during a close game, while there remain sente points on the board.]
;W[do];B[fo];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[be];W[ce];B[bf];W[bg];B[bi]
;W[af];B[aj];W[al];B[bh];W[ae];B[ci];W[ai];B[ah]C[alaric: well done.]
;W[ca]SQ[ak][cs]C[alaric: 1 point in gote while there are still sente moves on the board]
;B[da];W[ba];B[gg]C[alaric: -1 point in gote];W[cs];B[hk]C[alaric: -1 point in gote while ignoring a sente play from your opponent.  If white had thought there was something here would he not have played another move before now?]
;W[md]C[alaric: dame (0 point play), the same as a pass];B[ha]
;W[hs];B[ga];W[gs];B[gr];W[is];B[ka];W[kc];B[la]C[by now the seki was obvious for everyone]
;W[ak];B[bm]C[alaric: you ignore sente to play a few stones inside white space that are answered (0 sum).]

C[that was it.

thank you for your time!

alaric:  In all a pretty good game, at times you show skills beyond your rank.  If you had done a few things differently you would have won the game.  Here are some things to consider.

You mentioned that you usually play territory games so was trying to play an influence game.  That is good, even if it isn't your style of game it will be others, so better that you know it's strengths and weaknesses.  In this game though you favored influence to a fault.  When given oppurtunity to take profit in the corner or sides, go ahead and take it.  In general you cannot give up all 4 corners and still win with center territory alone.  The center looks big, but it is easily reduced, and it takes a large amount of influence to actually turn into real territory.

In the endgame sente means points, try to control it and play every sente move on the board, it's what makes the difference in a close game.]
