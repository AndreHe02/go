C[tom111 [5k\]: hi gg
qwsa [4k\]: hi

This is a game I don't really understand how I lost. I think I have a strong influence in the middle game, but fail to convert.  It seems to me move 89 was a turning point.  I also want to know more about anwsering w 28.

I asked a lot of questions as comments to the game, thank you for your time!

C[c6 is better direction here. with f3 you will be overconcentrated on bottom.
But f17 is a better approach and would have made your response to p15 much easier.]

and you would not invade 3-3 before that exchange.
