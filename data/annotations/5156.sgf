C[dmg: Hello, I am playing black here, I've lost by 2.5 points without komi but I feel like I should have lost by more. Thank you in advance for any comments.

$ hi, i'm sylvainc on kgs (and igs) all my comments will be precedeed by '$'.

if you want any more comment (even in french) you can contact me by mail or sylvainc on kgs]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[nq]TR[pn][qn][po][qo]SQ[mp]C[dmg: I was happy he forces me to make a shimari here

$ usually, an approch on 3-4 stone is on the other side (triangle) , or with larger space (square) when white doesn't want corner but bottom border. Afetr shimari, black will be able ton pincer severly the white stone so  i dislike this white move.]

(;B[qo];W[no];B[dd]C[$ black takes position on 3 corners. White botom is largely open, so black can be happy with this beginnig]

(;B[qk]LB[jo:A][qo:B]C[$ R9 is big of course, but the B group is settled, and A group unsettled. So the urgency is to stabilize A group.

(;B[bb];W[cm]TR[dp][gq]C[$ called 'the fool extension by some players'. Black can invade, and I think he must now.]

(;B[qf]TR[nc]C[$ if extend, then extend on the larger side : 7 spaces between O17 and F17, only 6 between Q16 and R9. also extend to the side of the weak D16 group better than on the side of thick R5.
after R14 , white has plenty of space to play on the top border. After O17, the space is not so large on both borders.]
