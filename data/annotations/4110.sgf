C[We played this game at IGS, we both set our ranks to 26k to get a rated game played. I think we're both ~28k, but i'd like to ask you what you think our rank is from watching this game?
I (black) have written some comments and questions in the sgf file but i'd be happy to hear any other comments and suggestions that you can come up with.
Thank you for taking the time to go through this game.

Hi, 
My name is Israel Rodríguez Nava, 10k from México.
To begin, i'll suggest you not to worry about your rank, it doesn't really matter now. It's only a number that helps you to play even games, the really important thing you shall care is to enjoy and learn from all the games you play.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[nd]SQ[pd][pc][qd]C[This is way too far from the corner; it's an invitation for Black to enter and get territory.
Usual openings are done at the marked points.];B[hc]SQ[pc][qe]
C[It was better to take White's invitation and invade the corner. I'd played at the marked point and start a more agressive play.]
;W[he]TR[cn][dj]SQ[fq]C[This is a bad move: one White stone against two of Black that could easily live in the corner with a lot of territory.
I would go for F3 because it not only attacks Black's corner but also works with White's Q4.
Other possibilities are the triangle marks.]
(;B[je]SQ[jd]C[Here a fight for the left upper corner starts.
- - -
A fight for the left upper corner played in the middle of the board, in the *fuseki*? (fuseki: the opening of the game).
Black is quite safe here, the White stone at H15 menaces nothing.
instead of playing K15 Black could easily and safely *tennuki* (play elsewhere), specially having so good chances to attack White's weak stones.
Supposing that answering to White is a good option, Black should have played at the square mark to keep her stones connected.

White is most likely dead in that situation... HOWEVER: Go is not a capturing game.
Chess is about killing (or capturing).
Go is about territory.
That makes a huge difference.];W[gc];B[hd];W[gd]

SQ[ad][ac][ab][bb][ba][aa]MA[cc]LB[fg:A][gg:B]C[At this point is there any way for me to anymore capture the white stones and/or save the 4 black stones at F14?
- - -
Yes, but first remember: Go is not a capturing game. You only capture when it works to your entire territorial strategy.

Let's analyze the situation:
White's group is virtually dead simply because of lack of eyes: the triangle marks are all false eyes, he has not a single eye.
Black group in the corner is quite live, in the circle marks you have one eye and the square marks are more than needed to get the other eye required to live.
But now, White has the option to live by killing the four separated stones with 'L' shape.
What to do? First you can't let White capture your stones because that way he lives.
So, let's see all the variations that could happen here (in a normal game you should do this mentally)
You played E13 so that's discarded, the other to options:
a) F13
b) G13]

;B[gg];W[gh];B[dc]C[Capturing this stones is useless, only gave you a couple of points, it's more important to save the Black stones in the middle, and it's unlikely that White allows you to connect them capturing E19.]

Good decision, White is getting MOST of the territory, at this point it would be normal to resign, Black has got only small confined territories.]
;W[pi]LB[qf:A][ql:B]C[This is not the best for White to defend his territory.
It's better to play either at A or B or the surrounding points.
B is better because that way you force Black to go to tthe corner and try to live there, you are pushing her against White strong wall.]

Black could easily now try to invade the Upper corner.];B[qd]
;W[pe];B[pc]C[Were these moves good to secure a small eyespace at the corner, or should i have played something else?
Black should better tried to connect with the big group of the side.]
;W[oc];B[pb];W[pd];B[qe];W[qf];B[qg]C[This move im uncertain of, would you have played it elsewhere?
- - -
Exactly, remember the word *tennuki*.
That's what i'd have done now, Black has got territory in the side and it's almost live in the corner it's now better to bet higher and go for the rest of the board.
Later, at the final stages of the game, who gets the corner will be defined, until then it's better to start developing other frameworks.]

- - -

L6 is quite safe. So K9.

With one stone you can atari K9, White will connect immediatly but then you have the L10 stone. 
However Black can be cut easily at K11, so better to keep the L9 point to be played later if you can conect.]

- - -
No, it's fine.
Generally you only protect weak points when the opponent is likely to play there, that means that playing there will pay more to your opponent than any other point in the board.]
;W[so];B[sn];W[sp]TR[bk]MA[ck][cl][dl]C[Do you remember the sequence here of the other variation?
It won't work now because you can't atari the marked white group, so it's better to sacrifice the stone with the triangle for the sake of territory (as you played).
See variation, it's possible to save the stone but  will cost you territory.]

(;W[tt]LB[ia:A][ja:B]C[Since white passes i decide that i perhaps don't need to protect all the weak points. Is the critical point in my upper middle eye at K-19? I think i would have needed to play a stone at S-17 also? But would i have needed to play T-15 and T-13 aswell? Any other weaknesess in my defence that i fail to see?
- - -
Your upper group has two vital points: A and B, if White plays J19, Black plays K19 and viceversa.

Now, regarding weaknesses, the game is over because there is nothing left to White to do, nor to Black. While your Black group in the right side has many weak points and bad shape, White can't do nothing because Black stones are in the third line, there's not enough space to live for White. also, because it's a huge area, Black can connect easily and live.
See variations.

Well, that's all. I hope my comments help you a bit, and don't forget to keep playing.]
