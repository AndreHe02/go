C[Hallo!

Thank you for reviewing my game. This game was one of the bothering ones, because I didn't see a clear mistake where I lost the game. I have some guesses, but I wanna ask you to review the game and to show me the moves where I gave away too much. I should mention that my prefered style is more territorial and solid, so usually I avoid big moyo games or fancy moves if possible, but I'm not reluctant to play that way if it's necessary.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jq];B[cn]LB[jd:A][fc:B]C[While Black 7 cannot be called a badmove, playing it at A or B instead would be preferable since he would be approaching White's stones from a 'friendly side' - Black 1 would help to strengthen it.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[io];B[fc]C[Good direction of play.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[fe];W[ed];B[ge]LB[fb:A]C[rs220675: I think that this Fuseki is alright for black. White has certainly some big moyo, but since my style is more territorial and solid that often happens. What do you think?

I think that this is fine. While sometimes Black plays at A, in this case, Black 29 is better since  the fight that would result from White cutting there would be too profitable for White.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[fb];B[id]LB[gb:A]C[Joseki is at A, since if White plays at H18 (as he did), it would set up a ko rather than guaranteeing White profit.]
;W[hb];B[ib]TR[df]C[rs220675: I did choose the marked stone since I figured if I'd play the marked stone at the marked point white would just get his opportunity on the upper side by playing J17, so it wouldn't be matter much..

I agree. D14 is also big, but not so much since 27 and 29 have already limited White's potential on the side.
J18, on the other hand, prevents White from a large sente follow-up and helps Black to make a moyo of his own.]
;W[ia];B[jb]LB[gb:A]C[All of White's forcing moves are quite painful to have to respond to. That is one of the reasons 33 is played at A instead.]
;W[eg]
(;B[mq]LB[lq:A][pj:B]C[Locally A is better - it attack the weakness of White's loose shape more fiercely.
Still, I feel that playing around Q10 (B) is larger.];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[ql];B[ip];W[nc]
(;B[pc]C[rs220675: Wrong joseki?];W[kc]
(;B[gi]LB[ke:A]C[It is more important to prevent White from settling the shape at the top. Perhaps A would be a good place to start an attack.

Also, Black 47 helps White make more territory on the side than Black can expect to earn from the influence.]
;W[ei];B[fh]LB[ke:A]C[Again, 49 is a helping move - it ensures connection, but removes any aji for Black to exploit. Attacking around A is more important.]
;W[ej];B[eh]C[Aji-keshi.];W[dh];B[jo];W[ho]C[rs220675: Here I still liked my position with black.]
;B[jn]TR[pm]C[rs220675: This marked move is my only guess where I made an early mistake. Maybe this move was better at the marked point to build a moyo myself. Because as you will see white used that move at K6 to reduce my moyo with P6.]
;W[on]C[rs220675: Would be Q7 an option?
Q7 would be my first choice. Perhaps it's not the best move, bt it you can separate White into two weak groups in your moyo, then you will surely benefit.]

(;B[pn];W[pm]C[Here you must cut. By keeping White's group less settled, you can attack more severely.]

(;B[oo];W[nn];B[mo]LB[no:A]C[If you decide to play here, A is better - if White plays here, you can cut.]
;W[no];B[np];W[mn];B[ln]TR[kc][nc]C[This move is unnecessary - attacking the marked stones is much more important now.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[lm];B[kn];W[qn];B[po];W[rn]TR[kc][nc]C[rs220675: Here I consider black in disadvantage since White has big territory and a nice second moyo around P10. Next move I played S5 which seems a bit too passive. Should I have attacked the marked white stones instead to keep a chance?

Yes, attacking those stones is most important. White's Q7 stones are settled, so S5 is only an endgame move now.]
;B[ro];W[ne]C[This move is huge. Now, Black cannot attack White severely and Black's corner has some aji White can exploit.]

(;B[md];W[nd];B[og];W[ob];B[pb];W[le];B[mg];W[je]C[rs220675: Just watch from now on if you can find a real blooper which could have saved the game. IMO I made the crucial mistakes earlier.]
;B[ie]LB[gk:A]C[This move does little. Instead, Black might like to play A to reduce White's territory there.]

For a recap, you played quite well throughout the game. You made a few mistakes, but who doesn't? 
While there is nothing wrong with a territory-style play, you just need to make sure that a move is not made solely for territory (of course, there are exceptsion to this); that it also helps to attack your opponent.
I hope this review helped!])
