AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, my specific reason for submitting this game for review is to request help with the early part of the game.  I thought that I was making reasonable moves, but by move 29 it looks like White has claimed a large part of the board, and I didn't know how to react to that.  I don't see any obvious invasion points (other than the corner, which I did invade - although not aggresively enough) and I don't know how I should have proceeded from this point, or reacted earlier on to prevent white from claiming so much of the board -- while at the same time preventing him from invading me severely.

There are plenty of mistakes that I made after move 29 that led to my territory getting cut down, but I am specifically interested in the early game.

Thanks!];W[dd]C[moshes [20k\]: Hi, good luck and enjoy the game.]

;B[co]C[hello!
my name is gius
up to here you developed very well

if you like a more territorial result you can play K3 and R10]

(;W[cn];B[bo];W[bn]
(;B[an]C[OK this leads to loss of sente so I probably shouldn't have done it, should have just played elsewhere.

true, A6 is a yose move ending gote
white A5 instead is sente, then A5 is privilege of white and black A6 is reverse sente

in fuseki play fuseki moves, as k10 or C17];W[am];B[ao];W[mc]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[og]LB[nb:D][nc:C][bn:B][cn:A]C[very bad moves by white]

(;B[om]C[Maybe at this point I could have been more ambitious, but I'm not sure where...

C17 is still good, or you take your last corner];W[fl];B[gp]
;W[en]TR[le][kf][jg][ih][ii][hj][gk][fl]C[you draw a line connecting the more external stones of white moyo and a move in the center of this line is perfect]

[fn][eo][dp][cq][br][as]C[This move I feel is over cautious.  Would K7 have been a better spot?

when you have this kind of doubts, divide the goban in two parts

as you see you have more then half goban, then at this moment the game is ok for you

if you play a move in the white half part is even better];W[jj]

(;B[qq]C[very good];W[lh];B[ni]C[Clearly I was trying to expand my potential territory but I think I should have been more ambitious.

I see
but remember that you can be invaded in both sides

then or there is an exchange of invasions or you have to protect your territories]

(;W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[nf]TR[ng][nh]C[This I think is wrong, I should have gone to N11, not made yet another weak stone.


O14 is a very good move, reducing the liberties of white group]

yes M4 was a bad mistake, it happens :-(

but the value of this game is probably to learn how to draw lines for reductions

have nice games!

Just one or two fewer stupid moves and I would have won... but still I am bothered by how much territory white made.  Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.]
