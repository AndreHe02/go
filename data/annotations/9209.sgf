Az: You generally played a better endgame than black, but the loss of the upper right from his connection under (and the destruction of a couple points you had in the center there when he pushed through) was just too much. 

Overall you played pretty well, it's refreshing to get a sane game. I'd say that you need to be more careful about doing things that help your opponent split between your groups, and you need a healthier respect for weak stones. Your opponent didn't do much to punish your weak stones, but you let him split between your groups twice, first in the LL corner, then in the UL corner. Both times it damaged one or both of your groups a lot, and both times the group that was coming out was almost fully alive (which really changes the balance of power). Your endgame was better than his, but it could be a lot better: you made at least 20 points worth of yose mistakes, and those are just the ones that I can see.

Hope this helps, feel free to send the sgf back to me if you have further questions that I didn't address.]

(;W[ir]TR[ho]C[Only [1d\]: I suspect this is better.  I somehow missed that black h2 was pretty severe.

Az: B h2 is really painful, which is why getting into a situation where you can only come out with H5 means you made a mistake. See earlier joseki choice commet.]
