C[Dear reviewer,

Thanks a lot for taking to time to have a look at my game! I played White in this even match without handicap. I will leave some comments and questions at some moves. Of course I am also very much interested in tips for other moves as well as general evaluation and recommendations.]
;B[pd];W[po];B[dq];W[ce];B[co];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[jp]LB[jc:A]
C[This move is not bad. If you just want to compare this and the marked point at A, your move is better, it's the classic extension off the open face of an enclosure. Point A is not yet urgent, you can use it as a natural follow-up to a white move at D17. If white gets greedy and plays around A directly, you can play D17 yourself, take some territory while looking for sente to finish at S16 (this is the active way to play, S16 directly is too passive).

With that said, the best and most active plan is to approach the corner directly. At the 3k level, it's a good time to learn at least some simple plays for 5x3 and 5x4 points. Even if you don't plan on playing them yourself, never hurts to have a simple plan for when you face it.

Should I better simply play A here?

I'm still not good at dealing with 5-4 openings. Maybe the result after move 8 was too good for White already? Anyway I thought that the right side was exactly what White wanted to get. Hence I took 'my' big point on the lower side.]
;W[dj];B[jc]C[Again, I would prefer the more active move and approach directly. This move is not bad though, it's more a matter of style.]
;W[dc];B[pq]LB[gc:A]C[You're correct.

Here I thought about playing at A just to prevent White from playing an extension. But I decided that playing an approach move in the lower right and prevent White from getting another corner enclosure was more important. The territory gain on the upper side is pretty small.]
;W[qp];B[op];W[qq];B[oo];W[pm]C[White has a verry good shape and K4 looks slightly out of place now. But sente is important, so difficult to say.

Again this most probably is what White wanted. But I still have sente so it's not too bad, is it?]
;B[ck]C[I would play G17 here, but this point is also big.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[dh];B[ek]LB[fk:A]C[Because of your shape at the bottom, point A is better, the outline would be very hard to invade.

This one felt slow. Should Black at least jump to A?];W[hc]
C[Now White got the extension...];B[je];W[he]C[Notice the difference in this position if E9 had been on F9 instead.]
;B[jk]C[...but Black got a nice moyo as well.];W[of];B[qe]LB[fi:C]
[oh:A][ok:B]C[Your analysis is correct, this was a move for the endgame. All three moves you suggested are good, they all follow the idea of playing on the border of 2 moyos. Because of the K9 stone, you have room to be aggressive. A move at point A looking for sente is an active idea.

This move was pretty bad, wasn't it? Lead to gote and gave White the time to play an invasion in the lower left. The problem was that I didn't find the best place to play my next move. Now I think that A, B, C might be interesting. What do you think?]
;W[rf];B[re];W[hq];B[jq]C[Yes, your thinking is correct. It is almost never right to go for the kill directly unless you are sure of it. In this case, the iron pillar shape taking away the base is good, you can make territory both on the right and left and while attacking the stone, can look for set yourself up to reduce white's right side as well.

My idea was not to kill White but to make it hard for him to live and get some profit in form of points in the lower part of the board as well as thickness in the center to be able to reduce his moyos in the upper left and on the right.

Is this the right way to think?];W[fq];B[er]C[Removing the base and picking up a few points, completely fine.

I didn't want White to get eyes on the edge but run into the center to get thickness myself.]
;W[gr];B[gp]C[You're right, this move is a bit strange. You can play on the other side at J2 with the same idea as the previous move, as well as follow the original strategy and play at K6. It is much too slow for white to play at G4 himself.

Anyway here I just wanted to prevent White from getting a ponnuki. Though this move doesn't really fit to my strategy.]
;W[hp];B[fp];W[ho];B[jn];W[ep];B[fn];W[gn];B[fo];W[gk]C[White is happy with the result, black is too concentrated following this exchange.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[im];B[gl];W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[mm];W[kk]
;B[kj]C[The wrong direction! K9 is not so important and you need to look to reduce the right side. I would prefer to play at N9 here.]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mk];B[lj];W[lk]C[When attacking, it is better to give your opponent a little bit of space unless you are going in for the kill.

The result was not as good as I expected. :( My stones at L10 are still pretty weak.]
;B[oi]LB[fi:A]C[This move is technically the right idea, but you needed to have pushed the white group in the other direction originally. Now that the white stones are connected to the right, reducing that side has become difficult and you should've shifted your attention to the top. I agree with you that point A seems good from here.

I do not like this move at all. It's not what I had in mind when I started to attack the White stones. If I had the chance to play again from here I would directly go for A instead.]

;W[pl];B[ni];W[mh];B[nh];W[ng];B[mg]LB[bk:B][eq:D][mf:A][qr:C]
C[All correct analysis on your part except I would not start with A. It is aji-keshi and it is better to save it as a ko threat.

At latest here I should have given up the attack. I could have played A to force White to connect and defend my upper side territory at the same time. Afterwards it might be time to start the endgame with something like B, C or D.]

;W[jf];B[hg];W[hh];B[kf]C[Still need to respond to the threat at M7, you have one extra move in the ko fight and M6 is dangerous...although then the ko fight becomes a must-win for black.]
;W[lo];B[gh];W[kp]LB[nn:A]C[You're right, the cut is a big issue. M6 was a big ko threat and white got away with 2 follow-up moves. The trade favors white I think.

Is there a way to defend against the White cut? I was quite short in terms of time so I did not find good moves in the game. I think that the cut at A really is a problem, isn't it?]

;B[ks];W[nq];B[mp]C[Here I made the next big mistake and the game was over.]

;W[jl];B[kd];W[kl];B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[nf];B[ph];W[qh];B[il]
;W[hn];B[qi];W[qg];B[ir]C[Just to sum up -

You noted yourself that your intent at the bottom was not to kill, but to make some territory on both sides by attacking the invading group. This is the right way to think, but then your moves after don't seem to go with this strategy. In the end, you attached, chased the group into the center and ended up losing the trade (your own attacking stones!). Remember it is better to attack from a distance. Don't leave any cutting points in your attack, and by the time your opponent makes 2 eyes or runs into the center, you'll have a strong wall and / or solid territory.
