C[Dear Reviewer,

Thanks for your time! I'm 5k (kgs), playing black here. I feel that opening part was much superior on black side, but than we started one battle that spread across whole board forcing me to resign.

This is my first time submiting to GTL, so based on FAQ I've do a lot of commenting of my own move - if you feel them irrelevant, please just ignore them, preparing game for review is also something to learn for me :)  I would really appreciate showing me also where was my major misjudgement of general direction of playing.

Thanks,
Lukasz.

Hi Lukasz, I'll preface my comments with an "e:"];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jq];B[lq]LB[cn:A][mq:B][nq:C]C[Is this right time for this move, or should I seek bigger move first?

e: I 'd be inclined to play at A instead.  It prevents white from getting a double-wing formation in the lower left.  Also, a white move at B or even C wouldn't be too threatening to black's stable lower right position.]
;W[nc]LB[nc:C][kd:A][pf:B][cn:D]C[I wasn't sure what should be direction for black now, even if this was obvious for W to play here. Playing R14 is promising right side, but I have a lot of loosing experience after staing only on one side...  So I choose to tenuki.

e: both a pincer at A or thereabouts to distrupt the top, or the admittedly one-sided response of B, are entirely reasonable.  playing at B would pressure white to support her stone at C, and will generally give you the sente to play at D afterwards.]
;B[cn]C[e: it's a very good spot for black.];W[fp];B[ck]LB[dj:B]
[co:C][bp:A]C[e: it may have been preferable to threaten the corner first with A, or to leap out further along the left side with B. Your move has a risk of becoming overconcentrated after a white kick at C.]
;W[jo]LB[kd:B][pf:A]C[Should I answear immediately m5? I feel it was too small at this moment

e: Yes, m5 is a too placid and obedient a move. Better to tenuki at A or B]
;B[kd];W[qc];B[pc]C[e: the proper side.];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[fc]C[e: it's a very nice point, and the game becomes promising for black.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ch]LB[ic:C][hd:A][id:B][ci:D][bp:E]SQ[db]
[fc]C[e: a mistake in direction. Playing at A defends a weakness and makes a large territory on the top. 

Think about white's potential moves before placing your stone. if white played at B or C, your two marked stones would be under attack and your territory up top would be very limited.

If white played at D, your stones on the left could simply extend to E in comfort.

Defending the top is urgent!];W[cb];B[qh]LB[hd:A]C[e: A good point, but A is still urgent]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[of]LB[re:A][qh:B]C[e: white leaves a weakness at A. This weakness is the reason why B is an effective attacking move in this kind of position.]
;B[pk]LB[hd:A][re:D][oh:B][qk:C]C[I would prefere it lower (S9), but this was following the low-high idea...  Was it correct?

e: Playing it higher is correct. C has a submissive posture. however, because black can exploit the weakness at D, it would be even better to play at B - making the maximum territory while attacking white's group.

Playing tenuki at A would still be excellent.];W[ic]LB[re:A]
[cq:B]C[Now is a turning point (IMHO).

This ends for me the fuseki stage.My opinion is that white is behind. And this is my first serious question - is this opening really better for black, or maybe I have some fundamental misanderstunding of opening? I know that black is in some area quite open for invasion or attack, but I still like the potential.

My opinion is that till now, white was too submissive in following black. Or is it just my impression?

e: white has major flaws at A and B.  That puts her at a disadvantage in the game to follow.  Black's position had only one weak point, which white just attacked.

If black handles this attack well, black should still be ahead!]

(;B[fe]LB[cc:D][fc:B][ic:E][kd:A][re:C]C[I didn't see a good way to connect with UR stones, so jumping out seems as best idea

e: I believe that this move values the wrong stones. The stones around A are important: they have potential territory and threaten white's group the the right (because of the weakness at C).

The stones at B aren't making territory and have no attack on white's stones at D. Their only merit is that they put pressure on E.  I think black should be willing to sacrifice the B stones to get a good result with the A group. See my variations.]
;W[ie];B[hd]LB[jc:A]C[This in fact starts black problems. My idea was here just to force white to connect to make her stones heavy. Next move that I was planing, was to jump more to center by something around F13. But seems white chose wisely not to connect...

e: thismove isn't terrible - it makes good shape on the left. But the right side is more important, and this removes black's option of playing at A.]
;W[jc]LB[kc:A]C[Now, when I'm reviewing this game, I'm still not sure If black on right is enough strong to cut and fight (as I actually did, but probably too weak), or or shoud he seek to strengthen P17 group first?\
e: White should have just connected. this move invites black to play at A, which stabilizes the group up top and leaves white still having to worry about the cut.]
;B[id]LB[kc:A]C[e: cutting here immediately is very bold and complicated. Simply defending at A would be fine.]
;W[jd];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[md]C[e: a good move];B[ne];W[lc]

(;B[mf]LB[me:A][nf:B]C[e: feels a little slack. Before doing a diagonal, think about a straight extension at A or B. You want your stones to impact the enemy position as much as possible.]
;W[kf]C[e: a key move for keeping black's position separated.]
;B[kg]C[e: it's aggressive! I like it!];W[jg];B[if];W[lg]
(;B[mg]LB[le:A]C[e: an exchange was possible here by playing at A]
;W[kh];B[mh]LB[mi:A]C[e: this move feels a little sluggish. consider A instead.]
;W[oh]C[This was quite painful for B. I was considering P11, but my readig skills failed me to see the probably outcome, so I've played more cravenly.

Also one question here - shoud B or W, play P15? For B it was gote so, it didn't looks like good idea, however, for w it seems perfect to kill eye, as it should be sente... This move was something that I was still considering for next few moves :)

e: P11 looks good! and P15 is gote for black - so bad. And it's dangerous for white, since black could consider sacrificing 5 stones for sente.]

(;B[mj];W[ni];B[mi];W[ok]
(;B[nk]LB[pj:A]C[e: a dangerous-looking move. I think black should defend the right side at A]
;W[oj];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[ml];B[kj];W[pj];B[qk];W[qj];B[rj]
LB[lm:A]C[e: it's a big move territory-wise, but if you played at A instead, you could capture or squeeze two stones and give your harrassed group some safety.]
;W[ri];B[rk];W[rh];B[rg]C[It was rather vulgar mistake for b.]
;W[rf]LB[qi:A]C[e: white responds incorrectly, giving black the potential to reverse the game later. White should play at A.]
;B[jl]LB[lm:A]C[e: not a bad direction, but a little soft. black should strike a hard blow at A.]
;W[mn]C[e: now capturing these stones will be very tricky];B[lo]
C[e: ...but this is a good start!];W[ln]LB[km:A]C[e: it's too slow. white should play at A.]
;B[kn]C[e: good!];W[ko];B[mo]C[Should it be M4?

e: your move is perfect.];W[nn]
(;B[no]LB[km:A]C[e: this move leaves white a narrow passage into your territory while leaving open an escape route at A.

black should play at A first!];W[on]LB[km:A]C[e: this is very greedy. White needs to escape at A before reducing black's position.]
;B[km]TR[on]C[e: Good!! white is sealed in, but it's a little tougher for black now that white has the marked stone.]

(;W[pn]LB[qn:A]C[e: looks wrong to me...what if white went A instead?]
;B[rm]C[e: this move looks good to me];W[qm]C[e: a tricky move..]

(;B[pm]LB[ql:A]C[e: this answer is incorrect. black should have played at A.]

(;B[rp]LB[sj:A]C[e: here, black sacrifices the stones above. but what would actually happen if black took at A instead?]

e: it's a good try];W[kq]LB[mr:A]TR[lo][mo][no][lq][mq]C[e:this clever move means that white can kill the marked stones at any point by playing A]
;B[ho]C[e: this lets the marked stones die, but it's bigger to kill the corner, so it might be the correct move!]
;W[in];B[gn];W[hm]LB[en:A]C[e: white missed a chance to play at A instead and sieze the initiative]
;B[en];W[hk]C[e: black's center is in trouble yet again :(]
;B[ii];W[or];B[pr];W[mr];B[os];W[lr];B[cq]LB[bp:A][cq:B]C[Is it correct move to kill corner?

e: no. it's safer to play at A.

A and B are both key points for thw white position, so your move was also good. But since your stone at B can be separated from your surrounding stones, it's a riskier manuever.]
;W[dh]C[e: it's a leaning attack, aimed at your weak center group.]
;B[di];W[he];B[hf]C[The next moves are the lesson for me for not reading if "ladder breaker", really breaks anything :)

e: it's a shame!];W[ge]
(;B[gf];W[gd];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[kc]LB[kb:A]C[e: this move shouldn't do anything - white should simply play at A]

;W[el];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl]LB[hp:A]C[I think F8 for B was last chance to do something out of this mess.

e: because white can cut off the marked stone by plating at A, white isn't in real danger. I black played there instead, the situation would be different.]
;W[il];B[ik];W[gm];B[fl];W[fm];B[fk];W[em];B[im];W[hn];B[go]
;W[iq];B[io];W[jn]C[e: good game!

Black got off to a good start, but left an opening on the top,

When white attacked, black rescued the less important stones, creating two weak groups instead of a single strong one.

The prolonged attack on the weakened group gave white ample opportunity to reverse black's opening advantage.

I'd recommend working on your direction of play - identifying which positions are safe and which need your attention. If an opponent's stone wouldn't trouble you, you shouldn't play in that place!

Thank you for sharing your game, and I hope this review was helpful!

Best,
