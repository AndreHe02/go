gnilkop [7k\]: hi

Hello, reviewer
I resigned around the middle game so the game is quite short. I feeled that I made many mistake in the joseki and made following fights difficult.

# [please mark which side needs review
# next time. From later comments it's
# white.

CR[ij][jj][hk][ik][gl][hl][fm][gm][en][fn][eo]LB[do:B][cp:A]
[ep:C]TR[pc]C[G: Tricky joseki. Only playable if the marked ladder is working for black. (It definitely is, with or without the triangled stone).


(B) is ok, (C) also possible (opportunity to attack either side with next move). Your alternative (A) is subbmissive.]
;W[do]LB[dp:A][ep:B]C[
G: White move is ok, usually black would answer at (A) if the ladder is good.

You also might want to experiment with white (B) which is more popular.]

(;B[dn];W[eo];B[cp]LB[en:C][cq:A][eq:B]C[Not sure what is the right way to answer this?

##########
G: (C) seems to be an overplay. (B) is super solid, but gives away the corner. Your choice (A) is ok.]
;W[cq];B[dp];W[ep];B[cm];W[dl];B[fr]LB[eq:A][er:B]C[# G: hard to tell. (A) is cleary inferior considering the endgame, but (B) would leave an aji to play F3 or F4 (for ko) in sente.  If I know my opponent is good fighter i would choose (A) definitely. :)]
;W[eq];B[en]LB[fn:A][go:B]C[
### G:
(A). I think (A) is too good for black.]
(;W[fn];B[em]LB[fk:B][el:A][fm:C][go:D]C[# G: black has very ugly shape. White is happy. Now (D) would be a simple and calm move. Cut is protected, there is no way to attack white for a long time, and two black pray would have been targeted.]

(;W[fm]C[# G: Ok, but white force black to attack his own group while the cut is still open. 

Chaseing your oppenent towards your weak groups is seldom good....]
;B[el]CR[fo]LB[dj:A]C[The result seem much better for black so I must have done something wrong

#########

G: I dont think its much better. F7 was a bit strange but white is still in the game pretty much.  You can consider (A) to calmly protect your 2 stones. Unfortunately (as result of F7) black can play a forcing move at bottom before escaping with the left group.]
;W[jq]C[Better to play on fouth line?

###
G: This move says: "Heck, I must have messed up something. Eh, leave it alone. Lets chaaarge!" 

Dont do this. If you think you messed up something, fix it, and THEN charge! :)

However third line is ok if you want to charge. But keep in mind that, black certainly will play a forcing move against the cut.]
;B[go]LB[hm:E][hn:D][fo:C][gp:B][hp:A]C[# G: This is a forcing move. Connect. Keep it simple. Ugly shape but its safe, and white must pay the price of playing F7.

If you are a hardcore fighter choose something like D or E. (I wouldnt :-)

Your questions:
(A) is aji keshi. Gives you very little (K3 is not in danger) but forces Black to connect. (B) would be horrible. (see var.)]

(;W[hp]LB[gp:A]C[May be cut at A is better?

###
G: Of course not.];B[gp];W[fo];B[ip];W[ek]LB[dj:A]TR[fm][fn]
[do][eo][fo][ep][cq][dq][eq]C[G: white marked group is somewhat weak. Don't press your opponent against your weak groups. You can try (A) to secure the left side and check what is happening. If black ignores you, unleash the attack, if (s)he answers you got sente.]
;B[dk]LB[dj:A][ej:B]C[# G: (A) is only move.]
(;W[dj];B[fk];W[ck];B[fl];W[hm]LB[dj:A]C[# G: Lets stop here a minute. We can see you've forced to play at (A) anyway, and black is got out. Check out move 30.]
;B[iq];W[op]CR[jc][qe][qj]LB[fj:A][hp:1][jq:2]C[# G: I think white should continou the attack against black at (A). White stones (1) and (2) are wasted, but there is no reason to rush.  If white kills that black group, the game is pretty over. There is a good chance of that black answer. 

I suppose this move is motivated by a fear of some black moyo. Well, there is no need to crack open what is not even exists yet.

Please consider that lower side is not so big.  There are plenty of room to extend and claim territory. Black need at least two moves to  build a fearful moyo at the bottom. (black P4 and extending at the right for example). White wont let that.]
;B[mq];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro]
(;W[no]LB[mp:A]C[G: (A) is possible. If you give up K3, lets collect some profit from it. Black will be pressed down.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[qn];B[qm]
(;W[pm];B[pn]LB[on:A][po:B]C[# G: A is interesting. If black accept you can close the corner, what is a good result.]
;W[po];B[rn];W[qo]LB[on:A]C[I think it better to take the stone at A and make ponnuki

G: Sure. Black is living anyway. Taking sente (or close in black) is good.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[qk]LB[pe:D][fj:C][km:B][ln:A]C[G: If you seek profit its on the top. 

(D) seems to be urgent as P8 is threatening. Choose (A) if you think you can do something with triangle (cut), if you cant, dont do this, because it might be ignored. With (B) we are in safe mode, seeking a connection. 

White still may try (C). Its reasonable to suppose that white group (1) can connect or live in the corner (with ko).]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[fj];B[hk];W[jo]C[G: do we need this? We might simply choose (A) and continue the attack on black later.]
;B[jp];W[hj]C[# G: Don't touch weak groups. That is said.
If white want to build a killer huge moyo hoping that K5 is enough for avoid troubles at the bottom, white sould play at the top. With F10 on at the sixth line top moyo would be fair enough. 

However, I would be quiet concerned about that connection...]
;B[ik];W[kn];B[im];W[in];B[jm];W[jn];B[hn]LB[gn:A]C[G: well, white is in trouble now. Get sente and try to live in the corner.]
;W[hl]LB[gn:A]C[G: Just play at (A) and get sente. Black is connected, there is no way to attack black while we are dying.... :-) Fix that problem first.]
;B[il];W[gm];B[gj];W[gi];B[gk];W[er];B[fi];W[ej];B[gh];W[br]
LB[gi:A]C[G: White should fight back. We will solve that corner somehow. :) By capturing (A) game is over anyway, and its easy. A 20k would do that. Killing your corner is mucho harder. (I cant see a clean way :)

Let black to show his (her) skill. :-)];B[hi];W[eg];B[ol];W[ho]
C[G: thats small. your corner is alive. What use to connect? Black might finish this game by playing at the top.]
;B[gn];W[hq];B[hr];W[io];B[kq];W[nl];B[nk];W[ml];B[pe]LB[kc:A]
C[I resign at this point


G: Yep. Black has clear advantage. (A) is huge for both, but black has right side. With some strong fighting skill in hand white might hope in black's error, but its ok to forfeit. 

You felt your fuseki was wrong, but this is not the case. Untill F7 I cannot see anything clearly wrong. And even after F7, I would gladly accept white side to continue.

You should try to be more patient. Sometimes calmly protect your group is more then enough. Making a stabile group might be a lethal attack in disguise. 

I hope my comments are helpful!
