;B[gc];W[cg];B[cd];W[gg];B[ec]MA[ge]C[Move 5: would have E5 been better?

yes, of course, considering W move, which occupies strategically the center.

However, I think B G5 would have been more efficient, because then, a W move in the center does not have the same efficiency]
;W[ee];B[gf]C[somewhat close (see var.)]
(;W[ff];B[ge];W[hf];B[he];W[ig]C[this is better than J4, which is gote]
;B[cb]MA[be][bf]C[no, you are playing inside your territorry. It is unlikely that W can invade and live.

B5 is better, and solid.
B4 is more greedy, but still playable, I think];W[dd];B[ed]
MA[dc]C[D7 defends better, I think];W[ce];B[dc];W[de];B[bd]

(;B[hd]C[you missed an aggressive line of play, with the weakness at F3
(see var)];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bc];W[eg];B[fd];C[Move 32: did I have any chance of trying something on white's side  considering the shape of the territoy surrounded by him?

No, there is absolutely no chance to make 2 eyes without W consent ...]

(;B[ih];W[hg];B[fg];W[ef];B[gh]C[poor white ...

Okay, this is when W lets you take the group.
It can play H2 or H6 instead of E5, but the situation would be very bad forW hite anyway, because you can cut him by playing E5.

I'll let you explore this]))
