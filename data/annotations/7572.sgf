C[Dear Reviewer:

There's a "click-o" at move 32;  I hit the mouse button while moving the cursor out of the way.  There may be many other moves which make no sense, but they were intentional.  I found some obvious (in retrospect) blunders, but there were probably many more.

I am most interested in fixing direction-of-play problems and fuseki mistakes in my game.

Thanks in advance for your time and effort!

     Rick Mott



Dear Rick:

My name is Adrien, I am around 1k on kgs, I'll try to do my best. 

I hope my comments can be usefull =)

From what I saw, I'd say black took a small lead in the fuseki, and then triggered a ko and lived inside -your- territory. You could greatly improve by trying to find ideas before playing a move. This sgf didn't include how much time you spent at each move, but I'm quite sure you could spend more time reading. For instance, ask yourself how much time you took to play n4, or the vital point of b17. (maybe I'm wrong, but from your endgame moves like s17, it was the impression I got. Furthremore, it never hurt anyone to read more =D)

please contact me if you have any questions !];B[pd]C[RickMott [5k\]: Hi, nice to meet you. :)]

(;W[cf]C[RM: Completely unsure what's the biggest move at this point.  This almost certainly wasn't it...

comment:
  hmm, to help you see what my reasoning here is, I added a very common opening pattern at the beginning of the file : the kobayashi opening. Here it is a very similar situation, the shimari at r5 is huge for black]
;B[jq]C[RM: But this seems small also.
comment : yeah, it's the wrong direction. In general, everyone wants to play in the direction of the komokus (like you did at c14, which was ok with regard to d17, at least)]

(;W[qe]C[comment:
I haven't found this on any joseki site, so all my comment about it will be based on my reading or my intuitions =D
There are two possibilities here :
 -black plays r14 and you're forced to play like you did :
   this means this variation is really weaker than the joseki (q18) because you'll be forced on 2nd line
- black plays r14 but there is a way for white to stay on the 3rd line or to start a good fight, maybe by cutting.]
;B[qf]C[comment:
if you answer this on the second line, you really lose something, so after r14, I would feel like playing r13 or q14 or r18 (like in the famous punition where black player r15 instead of q15). The problem is that those black stones are quite strong, so there might be nothing extraordinary about those moves, but they're just about fighting spirit. I don't wanna go on the floor (2nd line) =)]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[hc]C[RM: Maybe a line further at J17?  Better ideas?  I wanted to limit the effectiveness of the wall.
comment:
better here than at j17, you'd be too close from the wall if you got to j17. But the problem is that black has a huge moyo on the bottom. if he were to play q5 or r5, you'd be in trouble. (oh, and he did)]

Ah, this is good for white, black will have to run and it will ease white's entry in b's moyo + white will probably make a lot of territory]
;B[di];W[dh];B[dj];W[dq]C[RM: Too soon to worry about this?  E12 better?
comment:
e12 is huge... the question is : can he ignore your e12 and play in the corner (c3) ? I don't think it would be good for him ; his group would be quite weak. So no, I woulnd't play d3 yet.]

(;W[mp]C[RM: Direction of play again.  Not sure how to deal with black moyo...

comment:
ouch, this looks bad. it's not a question of direction of play, I think. first of all, I don't see the action on the left as finished. black d8 would make two hane at the head of two stones (a bad shape for white and somewhat connect his stones. (He won't do that now, of course, n4 is much bigger to attack. The move in itself doesn't look very efficient. It looks like it will give black more territory instead of reducing him.]

it's a good shape, not intended to capture. I don't think there are many other good moves for black here.]

;B[fh];W[eh];B[jf];W[cm]C[RM: Maybe wrong direction.  Should have chased top group with something like L13.   Couldn't read out to kill, though.
comment:
ok, I actually like c7 (but you should read for yourself if it was really necessary, (I can't help you with life and death, it would be usefull to you)) as for the center group : even though it might not die, you -should- be able to get into black's territory by attacking it. I don't think it can find life in your moyo.]

Even in the other order, I don't get the idea of this =), you 'll end up with less liberties for your group and black won't lose anything. (he's alive in top left corner, right ?

Pay attention to moves like these, it's really those one that drag us all down.]

What about this ? 
The fight after this is very muddy, I can't read it correctly, nor would it help you that I did =D. 

Just a few hint : you can try to kill the whole by playing around k12 to cut everything, that could work if black get out eyeless. You must also be carefull about you e10 stones because they can be cut. On the other hand, if b cuts, you capture h10 and you get some pressure move against f12 3 stones.]

you can also come in and reduce black right away, the game is still even at this point, the problem is that you only have the upper right corner as certain territory, and black only has to play things like r8 or n3 to get a lot. not reducing him right away will make the game harder on white]
