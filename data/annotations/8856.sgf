C[Hi, many thanks for reviewing my game! I've put a few questions in the file, but I'd appreciate if you point out any mistakes I've undoubtedly made.

Hi Marek,
Greetings. I am comsaint (nickname of course), a 2d on KGS (probably dropped since I haven't played for a long time). It is my pleasure to review your game.

I will try my best just to point out some obvious mistakes and variations, without looking too deep into any complicated combinations. My focus is primarily on the "direction" of play, which is very important for improving yourself.

Overall, I think a common problem of both you and your opponent is not knowing where the most "urgent" place was, and so had missed quite a number of "game point" during the game. I hope my comments will help you recognize this and play better in future. Let us begin!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[pj];W[de];B[ce]TR[ee]C[C: Since B played Q10, I have a temption of playing E15 at this point. But of course C17 and a lot of other variations are perfectly playable.]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fc];W[dj];B[jd]TR[fq][qn]SQ[jp]MA[nc][kc]
C[C: My opinion: K16 is not good (not urgent). For B I would consider hanging at F3 or R6, or near K3 instead.

A way to think about this is: If it was W's turn, where will he play? He may (without a doubt) play  near K4, the biggest point in the game. The upper side is small because:
1. Since B had played F17, there is no good way for W to play there. If W hangs at O17, B can play M17 (attack+ extend), then the Q10 stone will be in perfect position; if W plays near L17 instead, B can extend from the upper-right corner. B's F17 stone will be effective in putting pressure on W and in future atttack.
2. Just as the gameflow goes, after W enter 3-3, B's Q10 stone became very ineffective.

Conclusion: generally, if a point is not important for your opponent, then it is not important for you either, and vice versa.

Question: is there any difference if B's F17 was at E16 instead?]

;W[qb];B[nc]C[C: you can see B's Q10 is not good.];W[jf]TR[jp]
C[I really want to reduce B's top now. I considered a shoulder hit too, but black is strong on both sides, so I played a cap. Is this OK?

C: This move is OK, for B I cannot think of a good response, so I may leave it and play elsewhere. You can also consider playing at K4, wait for B's move before considering reducing his mojo or otherwise. B will only have the upper side, and may find it difficult to catch up.]
(;B[le]C[C: Very bad move. Never encircle territory towards strong stones.]
;W[he]
(;B[fe]LB[hc:A][ff:B]C[I considered A and B now. B is nice, because my left side would become very big, but I didn't like the cutting potential it gives B. But A is purely destructive, and I will have to look for life later. What do you think?

C: I would play B since it is simpler. See variations...]
(;W[hc]TR[ie]C[C: what will you do if B now probes at J15?]

TR[ih]C[C: Jumping out at J12 is safer.];B[kb];W[qn]C[C: After B played L18, jumping out at J12 becomes more urgent.]

;W[ep];B[fr];W[go];B[em]C[What's the best way to profit from attacking this stone?

;B[ek];W[dl];B[el];W[ej]TR[ih]C[C: another chance to jump at J12. Seems none of you realised how urgent that move was.]
;B[eo]C[C: A weird cut. Nothing B can attack even after he cut.]
(;W[gm]TR[gl]C[C: You may also consider G8.];B[gk];W[io];B[kq]
C[C: B played another strange place. J12 is "attack+defence" point now.]
;W[gi];B[ik];W[ko];B[nq];W[pq];B[no]
(;W[lp]C[C: you may keep the variation here since you may play the N14 - M2 combination later (or now).]
(;B[lq];W[mp];B[np]C[C: now B made a weakness at N2 for himself.]
;W[hl];B[gj]
(;W[fj];B[gl];W[hk]C[C: wrong! If the game was lost, it must be due to this move.

This was NOT the time and place for W to fight due to following reasons:

1. W already had a weak group near the battlefield.
2. After B bloack at H10, W's H8-H9 stones only had 2 liberties left, making any attack difficult.

Note however, without the extend at H11, it is now very hard for W to handle. It was only B's horrible mistakes (one after one) which saved W.]
;B[hj];W[il]C[C: if W cannot cut at J11, there was no point to pushed at H9.]
(;B[hi];W[gh];B[hh];W[hg];B[jh]C[C: Actually, W is almost dead by now. I cannot believe the result after that.]

(;B[nf]C[C: Mistake #3.];W[li];B[jl]C[C: B may keep attacking at M9 if he wanted. However, the chance is slim now.]
;W[ni];B[oh]TR[hk][hl][il][gm][go][fo][hq][io][ko][lp][mp]C[C: Another mistake. There is nothing there. If B wants to win he must attack the marked group now, try to kill it and/or see if by any chances returen to kill the upper group.]
;W[nh]
(;B[ql]C[C: OK, no hope for B now. The game will be over if W plays K7, which fixes his weakness.]
;W[pm]C[C: A bit dangerous. You really wanted to play N3.
K7 was good enough.];B[rg]C[This is not sente, right?

C: yes, you are correct.];W[pl];B[qk];W[jm];B[kh];W[oi];B[ph]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[nk]C[C: There is nothing worth commenting beyond this point.

In my opinion, W had been incredibly lucky in this game! Always making dangerous-looking situation somewhere but managed to get over it finally. But of course not all opponents would make that many mistakes as B did. So, remember to keep an eye on where the urgent place is!
