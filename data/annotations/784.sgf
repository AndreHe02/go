AB[dd][pp][dp][pd][jj][dj][pj][jp][jd]PL[W];W[qf]C[Vin: Black should try and place white under pressure while
trying to create territory for himself at the same time. Look at
variation 2.]
(;B[cn];W[pn];B[df];W[nj]C[Vin: White has now loosly surrounded a black
stone. Black should move into the centre and try and keep white split
up.];B[fj]C[Vin: As a general rule of thumb, go for the corners first
and then the sides of the board, with the centre coming last.

White 5 was trying to surround the black stone to its
right.];W[nd];B[fp];W[fc];B[nq];W[jf];B[jn]C[13

Up this point I thought I have the board ballanced and kept up my 9
stone
advantage, though white was begining to form a coalition to dominate
second
quadron by diagonaly coming in first and third quadron as well.

Q: Was my mirroring strategy appropiate for this start or is it clearly
a
disadvantegeous choice?

A: The mirroring strategy is a bad choice. White is working to a
different agenda to black. So far white has had everything his own way.
Black has yet to make a move that threatens or restricts him in any
way.];W[db]TR[jd]LB[cc:a]C[14

First move to diviate from mirror strategy.

Q:What move would have been better?

A: Either playing at "a" to restrict whites movement into the corner
while helping to secure some territory for black. Alternatively
defending the triangle stone by moving towards the centre.]
;B[ec]C[Vin: Bad move. This only makes white connect which he wants to
do anyway, and it does nothing at all to improve blacks
position.];W[eb];B[gc];W[fd];B[gb];W[fb]C[20

Q:What move would have been better?

A: Black 20 again does nothing useful.]
(;B[dc]C[21

White triagulated this corner. Knowing that my opponent is a much
stronger
player my strategy was to fill in as much space as possible but not
trying
to carve out a space that I likely couln not do, only allowing him to
build
up his forces. I the light of these:

What move would have been better?];W[qc]TR[pd]C[Vin: White has pretty much
taken over this corner. I'm not sure if the triangled stone is worth
saving.]
(;B[oe];W[og]TR[pj]C[Vin: This is not good for black. Not only is 22
coming under attack but also the triangled stone.];B[nf];W[le]
C[26

this steps apperantly is missing. I do not know the reason. This is my
2nd
SGF file to analize and my previous file also had at least one missing
stone
, the 40th one. Any suggestion what might be the problem?

(Second thought, it may have had been taken off at the stage where my
print
out is. Yes it must have been. I am not at my PC writing / studying this
game :-(

I presume that I simply continued with building the straight
line.];B[mg]C[27

This steps must have been the turning point of my luck. Such a master
move.
Did I ever had a chance to get out with my stones 22,24,26
alive?];W[li]LB[qn:a][ol:b][ge:c][lc:d]TR[pj]C[28

I thought it will rescue me but it did not.

What move would have been better?

Vin: I think it is already too late. Probably better to pay elsewhere
such as a, b, c or d.

White is also building up a strong attack on the triangled stone, and
the black group top centre is also vulnerable.];B[kh];W[lh]
;B[lg];W[kg];B[nh];W[oh];B[ni];W[oi]C[36

I still saw a light to keep my group alive

What move would have been better?

Vin: See my earlier comment.];B[lj];W[mj];B[mi];W[ki];B[jh]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[ng];B[mh]C[Vin: black 38 and 44 are just wasted moves.
This group is dead so leave them alone.];W[mf];B[me];W[lf]C[Vin: Black
has wasted several moves here.];B[md];W[nc];B[ne]LB[mc:a]C[Vin: a would
have been better.];W[ld]C[52

I should have go where he placed #53?

Vin: Maybe, see the variation.]
(;B[mc];W[lc]C[Vin: the problem here is that you are fighting in a very
small space against a much stronger opponent. While you struggle to keep
your stones alive you are damaging other parts of the board.]
;B[mb]C[55

I should have placed a stone there. When?

Vin: White didn't really give you much chance to play
there.];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]C[Vin: see the variation for an alternative
play for black 58.];B[od]LB[nb:a][pb:b]C[Vin: Black "a" here would have
been more interesting. If white captures 56 then black plays at 56
capturing three stones, and threatening to play b or at white 7 which
would make 2 eyes.

However white would play at a and blacks still dies.];W[nb]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[ib]C[Vin: I spent a while looking round this
position and I couldn't find a way for black to kill white 61, 63 and
65.];B[ic];W[jb];B[hd];W[hb];B[ga];W[hc];B[gd];W[id];B[ie];W[je]
;B[ic];W[qd];B[pf];W[id];B[pb];W[ke];B[oa];W[qb];B[na];W[cq]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp]C[90

What move would have been
better?];B[bo];W[br];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[bq]C[96

White is stopped here, am I correct? (Unless I overlook a stone like 96)

Vin: Yes white is stopped after 96. In fact white is dead unless black
gets careless.];B[dr];W[cr];B[es];W[cc];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd]LB[fe:a]
[be:b][af:c]C[Vin: Black looks as if he
will get a reasonable territory on the left side at this point.]
;W[ff];B[gf]LB[eg:a]C[Vin: you are trying to save the group 72 etc.
This will push white into an area which you would like to make your
territory.

I think I would have given them up and played at "a" and the left hand
side should then be safe.];W[fg];B[fe];W[ee];B[ge];W[ef]LB[ed:a]
C[110

This one looks a mistake. Later I placed the stone at step 124 but if
white
would have done it now, I would have been in a worse situation. Am I
correct?

Vin: I think you should have protected the left side.];B[gg]
;W[dg]C[Vin:
White is attacking strongly again.];B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh]
;B[bf]C[Vin;
Black can't make 2 eyes. Even if he could White's attack is a success as
he has greatly reduced blacks area here.];W[ci]C[118   Looked good at
the
time but from restrospect, it was a weak move.

What move would have been better?

Vin: I thought it was a reasonable move.];B[eh];W[eg];B[dh]
;W[ch]C[122

Waste

What move would have been better?

Vin: Again I though it was ok. It rescues the 110 group.];B[fh]
C[123

Black new what I did not yet see, that black is marked for death.

What move would have been better?];W[de]C[124

Just wasted a freedom

What move would have been better?

Vin: See the variation.]
(;B[ed]C[125

First time for me to see the threat

What move would have been better? Did I have any reasonable chance to
save
my stones in the first quadrant's corner?

Vin: I don't think so
now.];W[ae];B[ad];W[ac];B[cj];W[bj];B[bk];W[ji];B[ih];W[ii]
C[Vin: You
have let white into your area again, just to save 2 stones.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ij];W[hh];B[gh]LB[gi:a][kk:b][jk:c]C[Vin: black "a" would have been
better. White can't play at 138. But he would then play either b or
c.];W[gi];B[hg];W[fi];B[hi];W[gj]C[144

this stones ; 144,142,140 was a waste.   144 alone should have been
enough,
right?

Vin: Yes];B[hh];W[ej];B[fk];W[ek];B[ei]C[149

Never saw it coming. Not even now at replay . :-(

Vin: Just below 146 would have been
better.];W[fl];B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm]C[155

Despite the strong build up of white, I must have felt an upper hand or
at
least a ballanced game position.

How is my estimation as to where this game is at this point?

====================

I supose there is so much posibilities to one game that analizing it so
far
has more for me to learn than I can digest effeciently. Therefore I stop
this analysis here.

Please correct me if my thoughts followed here are at fault:

I see two kind of strategies to learn the Art of GO

1: Play a lot, as many games as I can

2: Play but between games analize every (or as many as possible to
digest
ie: x+1  where x represent present level)

I'd like to take the best of each school of thought.
The question is then, how often and how deep to analize games between
games?

ie: play 100 fast games and analyze the one that happened to be long due
to
deeper thinking?

Or just play a few games and analize the ones that is not clear why I
lost?

Please advise.

Sincerely

Vin:
I think you should try and play lots of games, but not too quick. Think
carefully about where you play and why. If you play very quick you will
make many silly mistakes so why spend a long time analysing them.

I like to play through my games to try and identify where the game was
lost or won.

I have recently bought a few Go bools and try to read a little every
day. It has helped me considerably.

White was too strong for you even with a 9 stone handicap. Try and play
against people closer to your own strength, preferably just a little
stronger than you.

In this game you let white control everything. I know it is difficult
when the oppenent is much stronger than you. But by not attacking white
at the very beginning allowed him to make a strong base from which to
attack from.   White always had the initiative. Black just followed meekly trying to
defend. Games are not won that way.

This is my first attempt at reviewing a game and I found it very
difficult, but I hope it will help you in some way.

End of analysis.
