C[wild - Dear reviewer, thank you for taking time out to review this game. I played black. In this game, I established what I think is a huge lead in the opening game. The lead was somewhat whittled down to just 2.5 points in the end. I felt that my middle and end game techniques are weak. I hope you could help provide some pointers on how I could improve on those areas along with highlighting some glaring mistakes in my game.]

 wild 2k*: hi enjoy the game];B[jd];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc]
;W[ci];B[pj];W[jq]LB[ql:A]C[G: A is more usual.];B[jj]LB[qn:B]
C[G: B likewise.];W[qn];B[jo]C[G: This is a bit strange. It is a nice reducing move but at the moment there are bigger plays. This will reduce and secure white while gaining little to black.]
;W[hp]LB[jp:A]C[G: With c & r3 open a response to either side feels bad. I would consider tenuki here. Locally the shape move is A.]
;B[on]C[G: Another dubious kikashi.];W[oq];B[cq]TR[dh][mo]C[wild : I hesitated a bit on this move. On hindsight, I should have continued expanding my moyo by playing around D12 or N5. What do you think?

G: N5 does not do much as you secure very little and white has ample ways of entering that area. D12 would be better. I like C3 as it makes H4 feel badly placed.]
;W[dq]C[G: Wrong direction of play.];B[cp];W[do];B[dr]C[G: Should continue pushing on the left.]
;W[er];B[cr];W[fq]C[G: Too submissive. White should C5. There is no way to exploit the E3 weakness here.]
;B[cn];W[lp]C[G: Too small. O17 seems to be the point.];B[ln]
C[G: K5 is a kikashi. You may let it go.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[pf];W[ld];B[kf]LB[kc:A]C[wild : Any better way to attack this? I encounter this very often.

G: A is the usual move. When attacking you should always look at taking away the base, then look at taking away the way of retreat.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kc];B[ib];W[mf];B[ph]C[G: The side is still open so this does not defend it. It alse has little effect on the center. White can hardly invade here now with his center group unsettled. D12 seems interesting.]
;W[lf];B[nb]LB[kg:A]C[G: Better at A.];W[mb];B[ob];W[je]LB[kg:A]
C[G: I would prefer just A.];B[ke];W[kd];B[id];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg]
;B[if];W[mh]SQ[jo][hp][ln][lp][on][oq]C[wild : I can't say I'm happy with the last 15 moves or so. Has black suffered unnecessarily?

G: At this point in the game sente is very important. White has broken up the mojo as was to be expected (that is a part of mojo strategy afterall!) The question is - has black managed to convert large parts of his mojo to territory. I'd say 45 pts. So in those terms the game is still wide open.

I would however like to as you this. Lets say those 3 black stones and 3 white stones. Who do you feel gains more here? I would say white. And this means black has been outplayed.]
;B[ql]TR[rj]C[wild : I was too worried about a white extension to S10. Is white's S10 justified?

G: Yes it is. This is another reason why O12 was suspect. If it was played at let's say R12 you would not feel like defending here right?]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[qj]C[G: Another gain for white. You defend while white expands.]
;W[pm]LB[lj:A][cl:B]C[G: This would be better at A. B is also big But A feels more uregent.]
;B[ck]C[wild : I thought for quite a while on this move. I estimated that black still commanded a comfortable lead at this point and therefore chose a more conservative approach. Was I too conservative? Is there a better alternative?

G: Let's count then.
Black upper-left 20pts.
Black right 30 pts.
Black lower-left 12pts.
Black weak stones in the center at least -5pts.
All in all around 55-60 pts.
White right 5pts.
White top 5pts.
White bottom 40pts.
With komi 55 pts.
Considering the fact that white now has sente I could not say black is ahead.

C9 was a good choice.];W[pl]C[G: Very small. White should be looking at a more direct attack.]
;B[bc]C[wild : The same line of thinking went into this move as well. Your comments, please.

G: Again a good move. O8 does threaten the center stones but those were weak before. This attacks white group here so It's a more positive approach. This does tip the game in blacks favour.]

(;W[cd]LB[be:A][cm:B][bl:C]C[G: Locally the shape move is A. A more positive way of dealing with the attack would be to attach at B or simply play C.]
;B[de];W[eg];B[ip]LB[df:A][ig:B][jl:C]C[G: Black can still cut through at A. I'd rather see this move at B. As white I would counter-attack at C and try to throw the game into confusion. Black should keep it simple.]
;W[iq];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[hq];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn]LB[dn:A]C[G: Since white A is sente this is an overplay.]
;W[en]LB[hn:A]C[G: Should have cut.];B[em]C[G: Leaving to many cutting points behind.]
;W[hn];B[io];W[dm];B[hm];W[fm]LB[cm:A]C[G: A is sente.];B[gm]
;W[el];B[cm];W[mn];B[lo];W[mo];B[kp];W[kq];B[mm];W[nm];B[nl]
;W[ml];B[lm];W[om];B[mk];W[df];B[lb]LB[bj:A][fk:B]C[wild : This group of white stones were still not secured but my attack on its eye space had failed miserably. Any better way to attack?

G: No need to attack. I would start the endgame with A then start expanding at B.]
;W[ma];B[kb]C[G: A mistake.];W[jb];B[le];W[me];B[ja];W[ka];B[mc]
;W[md];B[ia];W[lc];B[ad];W[bf];B[bj];W[bi];B[ai]C[G: Small and gote.]

;W[hg];B[he];W[ig];B[ie];W[gh];B[gd]C[wild : From this point onwards, it was largely the endgame. I was surprised the game ended so close because I still reckon balck has a comfortable lead. Was my estimation wrong? Or I made some serious endgame mistakes?]
;W[fi]C[G: Let's count then.
Black cc 80pts, white cc 70pts + komi. So the game is quite close.]
;B[gk];W[qe]C[G: These and the following moves secure blacks teritory and eliminate any aji here. Lateron white loses several ko fights for lack of threats.]

;B[bk];W[ds];B[cs];W[co];B[bo];W[bn]C[wild : This got me in a fix. There were threatening kos on both side but somehow white missed the ko on the bottom. If white had spotted it, white would have won, whether he eventually won the ko or not.]
;B[bm];W[bp];B[an];W[bq];B[br];W[ar];B[es]C[G: If white wasnt planing on fighting the ko then A2 should have been at E1.]

;W[lq];B[dl];W[ds];B[aq];W[cl];B[nn];W[no];B[dl];W[oh]C[G: White lost a bit. The game is quite close now with white loosing a bit now and again. I would not say your endgame was weak but rather you estimate of lead was off.

Hope this helps...

(;W[bs];B[as]LB[ed:A][mp:B]C[wild : This would have be disastrous. Even if black wins the ko, it would have to sacrifice a bit elsewhere.

G: White only threat is A. Black B might just be large enough for this ko.]
