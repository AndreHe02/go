C[Dear reviewer thank you for looking at my game and reviewing it. I am black in the game.

In the beginning I ended up with two long sticks of stones but I don't know exactly what I did wrong so that I end up with those funny shapes.

My opponent made a tactical error in the beginning but in the end won the game. I also made a couple small tactical error.

Can you review the shapes and how I made them and point out any inefficient or bad shape. Also can you review the direction of play. These are two things I want to grow in.

Also point out any moves that are slow or two solid.

And any tactical errors that I miss or did not get right

Thank you

Joel Vose

fa: for 13k, i think this is a good game. 
i still have some variation i want to show but i think it will be too much for you right now.
generally, my advice to you:
- learn how to use 1 space jump, 2 space jump, keima jump, large keima jump. this can help you gain territory faster.
- learn sente and gote. very useful to gain more points in the end game. you could win if you take all sente available.
- think about what you want and what your opponent probably want. this will improve your direction of play.
for now that's all from me. if you have further question you can email me. regards.]
