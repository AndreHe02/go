C[
Dear reviewer,

I played black in this game, and lost by 5.5 points, as the game was quite tight. I thought I was ahead at one point, but then I lost due to some tactical reading errors, and lapses of judgement concerning which moves were big and which were not, but I am not certain. I might've done better in many areas, and thus I would be quite interested in what you have to say.

Dear reviewee,];B[qd];W[dp]C[bconwil [10k\]: hi];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[od];W[qj];B[qn]C[Ecyrd: Perhaps a bit cautious. One line higher at R7?

adum: i might prefer R12, as there seems to be more potential to make territory on the top. but this move seems fine, and R7 does too]
;W[qg];B[kc];W[or]C[Ecyrd: Interesting attack... I felt that this was very weak, but I couldn't exactly see what would be a good way to punish.

adum: this is a standard if not well-known at low ranks method of approaching the corner.]
;B[pr];W[oq];B[pq];W[mp]C[this is fine for black because the corner is solid and white's shape is bad. the two stones touching against black's three is poor. you should attack this immediately]

(;B[cj];W[jq]C[now white has secured these stones];B[cn];W[dn]

(;B[dm]C[this move provokes white to extend towards the center, which is what he wants to do to increase his moyo along the bottom.]
;W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[fp]C[Ecyrd: I already had a base for my stones thanks to the C10 stone, so I felt that this might be good to break the shape.

adum: F4 is indeed a weak point. seems like a reasonable invasion to me]
;W[ep];B[ip]C[normally in situations like these, you touch the opponent's stones with your invading stones to build strength -- attach when you're weak.]
;W[fq]C[white's inviting you to run out];B[jp]
(;W[iq];B[kq]C[Ecyrd: I ended up doing this instead of H3 because of the weakness of F4 stone. However, I am not at all certain this was a good idea.

adum: this is a good move, better than H3. this way, you may be able to exploit the weakness of the stones to your right. H3 just lets him play L3 and be safe]
;W[kr];B[hq]
(;W[kp]C[starting with this move, white makes a series of poor tactical decisions. black should end this local situation needing to run out, not with a base, even in ko.]
;B[lq]
(;W[lp]C[this works, but is slightly complicated];B[lr]
(;W[ir]C[this mistake is fatal];B[hr];W[hs]C[white tries to sneak a ko where there isn't one]

(;B[gs]C[oops, give white a free ko. without this, white would have to resign]
;W[js];B[is];W[cm];B[jr]C[Ecyrd: Connecting my stones and cutting white apart? I chose to take the ko - I don't think that the loss of the two stones would matter that much. However, in retrospect, I should've probably immediately extended at C13 after this to gain a base.

adum: well, the bottom is bigger than your two stones, though those two stones are bigger than they look.]
;W[bm];B[pk]C[Ecyrd: C13 would've been much more urgent.

adum: yes. that stone needs a base more than you need to attack the white stones at the bottom]
;W[lm];B[pj];W[qk];B[ql];W[pi]
(;B[qi]C[this is poor. white just takes it in a ladder.];W[ri]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[nk];W[oh];B[ni];W[jn]
(;B[in]C[don't touch weakness is a good proverb. here that's what you're doing, and you help white become strong]
;W[im];B[hn];W[hm]C[white has wrapped around you, pushing your two stones towards your already strong stones, which makes them useless]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[fm];W[fo];B[gn];W[em];B[hl]C[good];W[il];B[hk]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[ij]
(;B[fl]
(;W[ch]
(;B[fc]C[Ecyrd: Hm. Perhaps an invasion at D14 would've been better, but I thought I could save the C10 stone, and defend my territory on the top and lower right areas, so I would be leading.

adum: yeah, black is ahead still. F17 is fine to approach the top, but i still think the middle is more urgent. H11 is probably reverse sente. J11 if you're feeling adventurous]
;W[fe]C[this is bad by white. there are no points on this side because your strong stones are already there]
;B[db];W[cc];B[hd];W[gk]
(;B[gj]C[this pushes white out];W[fk];B[fj];W[ek];B[el];W[dk]
;B[dl]C[this sequence just helps white];W[ck];B[bk]C[Ecyrd: Perhaps D11.

this whole area is small now. worry about your H10 stones];W[cl]

(;B[eg]C[bconwil [10k\]: hmmm.. what a mess

Ecyrd: I was trying to put pressure on the C12 stone, which would allow me to connect the cut-off group at H10.

adum: C12 can run up or down. it's not afraid of E13. it's black that needs to worry]
;W[ej]C[bad move. helps black];B[ei];W[di];B[hg]C[good];W[eh]

(;B[hf];W[ii];B[hi];W[li];B[lk]C[unfortunately, it's hard to attack this group now because white got strong already]

(;B[ol]C[why? thse stones are safe];W[ml];B[mk]C[this is small now because white is already safe]

(;B[pm]C[is this really necessary? i don't think so];W[on];B[md]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[ic];W[jf];B[ge]C[Ecyrd: Mistake... Better to just play G16.

adum: minor difference, i think];W[gd];B[he];W[fd];B[ff]C[Ecyrd: Another mistake. G17 much, much bigger.

adum: yeah, this is huge, probably 25 points, much bigger than margin of victory]
;W[gc];B[dg];W[cg];B[ig];W[jg];B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[ec]C[Ecyrd: White top left corner is now huge.  I don't know, but it feels like this exchange cost me the game.
