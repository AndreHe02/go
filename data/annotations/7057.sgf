C[thirdeye [3k\]: hi

JS: I am Juergen Suntinger 3d and come from Vianna, Austria. I hope you can learn something from my comments on this game. If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me on KGS, Juergonaut.]

;W[id];B[cf];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd]C[JS: Everything developed normaly so far]

(;W[gc]TR[id]C[I think this should have been at F18

JS: cutting directly is only used, when there is no white stone extending whites wall. White can get overconcentrated quite easily this way.]
;B[de]C[This move by my opponent felt slow

JS: True, there are bigger points to get on the right side of the board]
;W[nc];B[hc];W[fb];B[hd]TR[id]C[JS: This is actually the reason why the cut earlier was not soo good. But if Black should play this way immediately is also questionable.  If there is no tactical reason why the marked white stone is taking a liberty of the black stones then it has lost its meaning. Look at the variation]

(;W[kc];B[hf];W[fg];B[ie];W[ic]C[I wanted to prevent him making an eye by capturing j16

JS: Yes, this keeps the black group some kind of attackable and also stabilises your white group on the right a little bit]
;B[hb]
(;W[qf];B[oe];W[qc]C[R17 hurt my stones to the left so maybe extending around q12 is better?

JS: White is not so strong, so he should first stabilise his group like in the last variation with the urgent shape point, and then decide how to deal with the right corner]
;B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[pf]C[JS: This move by black is bad. It just strengthens White and keeps bad shape. Look at the variations]
;W[qg];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[lc];B[jd];W[ib]C[JS: Black should take sente now and play elswhere because white already lives unconditionally]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kd];W[ob];B[pb];W[la]C[After reviewing the game I don't think this was necessary

JS: Yes it was already alive. So you lost one move here which is quite big]
;B[ia];W[ja];B[oa];W[na];B[mb];W[lb];B[qb]C[JS: Small move by black, there is so much open space left on the board]

(;W[jo]C[I also thought about O4

JS: Yes, it is bigger to stabilise the Hoshi stone with O4 instead of  extending like this.]
;B[qq]LB[jo:B][hq:A]C[JS: This is just what black wanted, because after the A,B exchange white's center will be a little bit overconcentrated]

;B[ql];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[lj]C[JS: Now white's moyo has no good followup anymore, but is only making about 30 points of territory. When considering the stones played by white this is some kind of overconcentrated.]

(;W[cl]LB[ci:A][ej:B]C[JS: This is the shape point for white, because it leaves bad aji for black. A white placement at A or attachment at B can give black a lot to think about. If you let black get this, he will be ahead I think
