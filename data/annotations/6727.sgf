C[laker [1d\]: hi
Epiphyte [1d\]: hi];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[iq]LB[ip:B][hq:A]C[reid: This is an unusual pincer.  A is usual, and B is also common.  Black can safely tenuki here and see how things develop.  He will seek to make J3 into a bad move later.]
;B[cd];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jc];B[pq];W[po]
;B[qo]LB[mq:A]C[reid: By attaching underneath, black allows white the chance to make J3 into a good move.  I think black A (trying to make J3 bad) would be a better answer.]
;W[pp]C[reid: The avalanche looks like a good choice for white here]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[qq];W[or]LB[pn:A]C[reid: But this is a severe mistake for white.  Joseki is for white to extend at A.]
;B[cq]LB[pn:A]C[reid: However, black fails to punish white.  Black should hane at A.  White has no good answer.

Black C3 is worse than just failing to punish white's mistake.  It actually helps white to build a nice moyo on the bottom.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[reid: Locally, this is joseki, but look at how well the white stones are working together. Globally, black is falling behind.]
;W[dn]LB[cm:B][em:A][pn:C]C[reid: If white wants to continue here, the correct move is A.  Of course, that might not be sente in this situation, but the exchange of white D6 for black C7 is good for black.  White should simply extend to C directly, without playing D6 (or A).]
;B[cm];W[pn]C[reid: White takes the critical point, and now the result is very good for white.  Black has three (and a half) corners, but they are small.  All the white stones are working together well.  Black F3 seems to be a wasted stone.  White doesn't have any bad stones on the board.

Looking at territory, black has about 12 points in the lower left and 6 to 8 in the lower right.  The upper left is joseki and four stones each, so the points should be the same.  Black's upper right stone is worth 13 points (twice komi - actually a bit less since K17 and Q6 reduce its value slightly).  So if the white moyo is worth 12 + 7 + 13 - komi = 25 1/2 points, the game is even.  I think it's worth more than that, so black is behind.]
;B[qn]C[reid: hmmm, black helps white to build the moyo even bigger.]
;W[qm]LB[pm:A]C[reid: White is greedy - simpler would be extending to A.  Black is pushing white along on the fourth line.

On an otherwise empty board, it is hard to say which is better: black on the third line or white on the fourth line.  But on this board, with J3 and the D5 stones already in place, it is better for white.  And since black is pushing from behind, it is even clearer that exchanging black R6 for white A is good for white.]
;B[pr]LB[pm:A]C[reid: Black is behind, so he needs to do something a lot more aggresive than this.  This is a very slow move.

Cutting at A would be more interesting.  Black is trying to take advantage of the overplay at R7 and the cut at P4.

At a minimum, black should at least exchange S7 for R8 (in sente).  He could then tenuki to try some kind of invasion of the white moyo.]
;W[rm];B[rn]C[reid: Ouch.  Having to make this move in gote is painfull to say the least.]
;W[jl]LB[qf:A][el:C][ol:B]C[reid: White A would also be a good way to continue - perhaps more natural and aggresive.  It helps alleviate the problem of the cut at Q7, and it doesn't put all white's eggs in one basket.

K8 feels to me like it's asking for too much.  White is trying to take about 50 points (in gote).  If black invades successfully, white could be in trouble.  But white is ahead, so he still has the advantage.

Protecting the cut directly with B would be a bit slow, but still better than K8, I think.  It makes A and C miai.]
;B[pm];W[np];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[qj];B[pj];W[qi];B[ll];W[pi]
;B[nc]LB[ln:A]C[reid: Black misses the important point here:

The Q16 stone still has miai (O17 and R14), so it doesn't need help right away.

In contrast, the Q9 stones are floating around loose in a sea of white stones.  They need help *right now*!

The proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move" - this is a perfect example.  Black should be thinking about how to stabilize the Q9 stones while reducing the white moyo.  Perhaps a probe at A (M6) to see how white responds, for example.]
;W[nj]LB[rd:C][kn:A][ln:B]C[reid: I think this attack is from the wrong side.  White wants to realize his profit from the moyo on the bottom, so he should be thinking about A or B to attack instead of O10.  Since black already has Q16/O17 in place, O10 doesn't have much future potential.

White C would also be a good point - gouge out black's corner while stabilizing the R11 stones.]
;B[lj];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[ml];W[nk];B[ln];W[nn];B[lm];W[om]
C[reid: Black gives up a lot here.  The Q9 stones are worth more than 10 points, and now the S11 stones are impregnable.  Adding insult to injury: the M8 stones still don't have any real eye shape - they are floating.]
;B[lp];W[jo];B[kq];W[ko];B[lo]C[reid: The M8 stones are taking away white territory, but to win, you have to make territory, not just take it away.]
;W[mq]LB[rd:A][lh:B]C[reid: eh?  what is N3 for?  These white stones are so strong, they don't need any more help.  And N3 doesn't attack the black stones - they aren't even surrounded yet.  White A is much larger.  Attacking with B is also better.]
;B[lh];W[el];B[dj]LB[qe:A]C[reid: Black only takes a few more points with this response.  Since C7 and C14 are both low and very strong, the left side is small.  White E8 shouldn't really be sente.  The upper right corner is bigger (black A, for instance)

The remainder of this game is really just settling the yose.  The game was decided when black played at C3, and there have been no major upsets since then.

This was a pretty easy game for white, I think.  Black needs to become aware of the use and value of outward facing power.  Simply taking territory is not sufficient to win a game.  Particularly early in the game, power (influence) can be much more important.

Perhaps black should try to play more power-oriented games.  Make the decision to go for power early in the game and see where it leads.  You will probably lose a few games to start with, but your play should become more balanced as a result.

Good luck, play strong - reid
