C[Igc98 Generated Sgf File];B[pd]C[Hello,    thanks for reviewing my game!    I played black and won (because my opponent´s mistakes were even bigger than mine).        I think my main weakness is close combat, especially in the middle game.     oc: We will see :-) By the way, i will begin all my comments with oc:. This way you are able to distinguish them from your own easily. But please, don´t take my comments too seriously, i am not a strong player. And feel free to ask me, if something left unclear or if i made a mistake (yes, thats possible).
    Bye, magruber];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[dj];B[dh]C[oc: this is a little bit to slow. Imagin that you both will jump into the center, than white will gain more than black. As white has occupied the left side, why not take the right side for black (with R6 or more relaxed Q10)?]
;W[fj]
(;B[fq]C[is there a better point to reduce white´s influence?
oc: yes there are (see variation). But first: the influence is a product of your last move. So the fact, that you are worrying this influence only one move after should be an indication, that there must be something wrong with that move.]

(;W[dr]C[oc: the wrong direction. Black was playing to reduce whites moyo and this move only helps black in this goal. And the corner is not definitly closed at all.]
;B[jq]C[oc: good];W[hq];B[hr]C[oc: i would prefer to play at H4. Note, that your intention was to hold the white influence in check, not to make black territory here.]
;W[gq];B[gr];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[iq];W[dq];B[io]C[oc: good]
;W[fr]
(;B[nq]C[oc: in my eyes the wrong direction for the kakari. Your stones on the bottom are thick, there is no easy way to attack them. Thats why there is no need to play from this side and the gain in territory is rather small.]
;W[pq]C[oc: By the way, at which level you are playing? As i was asked to review the game an me are about 5k on IGS i think you are about 10k, arent you? This move is simpel bad as it is much too territory-oriented]
;B[qn]C[oc: best move in this situation];W[qo];B[pn];W[ro];B[qj]
;W[jc]C[oc: good];B[hc];W[mc]
(;B[id]C[oc: this gives white a move at P18 to stabilize his group easily.]
;W[jd]C[oc: not good, because it strengthens black, not making two eyes for the own group]
;B[je];W[ke];B[ie];W[kf];B[fh];W[ne];B[pf]C[oc: now there is no big fight on the board and time to count.  white has about 35 points on the left, 10 points lower right corner and 8 points on top = 53.5 points
black has about 35 points in upper left, 8 points on bottom and about 15 points on the right = 58 points
On real, secure territory black has a slide lead and what is more, the opportunity to rise his territory because of his influence.
Now the biggest point would be C12 for white or C10 for black]

(;B[qm]C[oc: must be at T7 to divide. there is nothing to worry about as the ladder works for you]
;W[sm];B[rl]C[now I started to play more weak moves, but not because the game was getting uninteresting.    My reading ability is to weak.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[sk]C[no good result
oc: but a fair one if you take into account that T8 is a kind of monkey jump from the corner. But if you take into account that you got the chance to cut off this monkey jump, than it is a bad result :-)]

white has 40 points on lower left, 11 points lower right, 2 points upper right and 5 points on top = 59.5 points

You have a sure lead in the game.];W[kp];B[kq];W[on];B[oo];W[om]

;W[op];B[np];W[ei];B[ma]C[I´m looking forward to your comments !
oc: You got the far better position from the fuseki due to some mistakes in direction from white. In the middlegame you made good use from your thickness leading to a sure lead by more than 20 points. But after that you made a lot of endgame mistakes and let white catch up. At the end of the game it was quite close. Until the cut off in the center i could not say that you would win.
One hint (as i can only follow one hint at time, i will give only one hint at time):
if you are ahead as in the game by about 20 or more points, don´t search for a fight but try to consolidate all your positions making the game easy. Try the simpelst move first, and if it works, don´t look for a move that gains you one more point (but leaving a weakness in your shape).
I wish you and hamster a lot of interesting games in the future.
