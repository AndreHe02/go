C[The basic idea behind a pincer is to control where your opponents stones go by gaining a local numerical advantage.  Pincers also break up moyos and can also be extensions of your own moyo, or strengthen stones.  

My recommendations:
At this point in your Go career you need better and more accurate reading as well as a review in fundamentals.  There are a lot of reading issues but the may problem of this game was that both players played from the wrong directions, and did not play defensively when a defensive move was needed.  I saw a LOT of overplays.

I include a lot of variations of my own reading just for you to look through with brief comments.  This is a fighting game so its rather hard to come up with a golden variation I think is 100% good for either side.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do];W[cm]C[This is fine, its a low move so this stone is defensive, and you need to play defensive because d16 (high attacking stone).]
;B[bo]LB[en:A][cq:B]C[I think this is extremely aggressive, too much so.  Pros play at A or B normally.]
;W[fp];B[en]
(;W[dk]TR[dd]C[This is a bad move, you're not taking into account blacks d 16 stone, and you're playing an attacking move without getting a chance to play the closing defensive move.]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[eq]
(;W[er];B[dp];W[iq];B[dr];W[fr];B[cq];W[jq];B[ci]C[So this joseki isn't very good for you because of this move.]

(;W[cg]C[This is indeed overplay.  You are counterattacking but again c13 has no support and e6 is quite strong.]
;B[ei];W[fk]
(;B[df]C[This is aggressive but not as much as it could be.]

;W[bi];B[dl];W[ek];B[cl];W[fh]C[Well first off you have bad aji as you saw later in the game with this shape.]

(;B[fl]
(;W[gk]C[AP: In hindsight i should have played this move at E12 i think, is that right, or is moving into the center with G9 correct afterall?]

(;W[fc]C[Cant really attack black with a big hole in your shape so]

(;B[fe];W[hd];B[eh]C[Yeah this sucks];W[eg];B[dg];W[ch];B[fg]

(;W[cc]C[you have a problem with leaving weak groups behind when invading, and this is a problem i see with a lot of kgs two kyus.  You're going to be split and if you dont get sente h 16 will be attacked.  I know you want to attack the black group but it will be more effective if the groups surrounding him are stronger]

(;B[gb]C[this is aji keshi especially considering the ko in the corner.]
;W[gc];B[hb];W[fa];B[jb];W[ia];B[pc]C[That was all aji keshi on blacks part but thankfully he pulled himself together and go this move.  You mentioned you thought he let your group live too easily, but thats not really a concern here.  Your group lived with 8 points whereas his outsides moves with q17 are by far worth more than 8 points.  He doesn't care if you live, he has more points.]
;W[fj]C[This is gigantic, otherwise black cuts off your center group, plus now j14 is bad aji for black.]
