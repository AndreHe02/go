C[Although I won this game, and probably would still have done so without W's blunder at the end, I felt that I started to lose control at around move 120.  I would like to know what I could have done to avoid this.  I think that perhaps the strategy I was employing was wrong but I am not sure at which point it started going wrong.]
;B[qd];W[ec];B[dp];W[pq];B[po];W[np];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or]
;B[qk];W[cd];B[ci];W[cn]C[reid: this white move shows that white doesn't want to let black
have anything.  This is the beginning of white's trouble.  Black
handles this premature invasion well, and gets an early lead.

I think white should be more patient, and play in one of the areas
are still somewhat open: either the top right, or kakari D4 from
the other side at f3.];B[cl];W[en];B[fp];W[cg]C[reid: white wants to attack the black stones, but realistically,
white needs to evaluate which group is stronger: black's c8, c11,
or white's c6, e6.  It's pretty clear that the black group is
stronger, so white's direction is questionable here.

A splitting attack, one group between two weak groups, is a great
strategic position.  But here white has a weak group between two  strong groups - not so good.]
;B[co]C[reid: nice timing.];W[bn];B[el];W[bl]C[reid: Just by playing on the second line like this, white
is losing ground.  Running out with g6 is more natural.];B[bk]
;W[cm];B[ck];W[fm];B[gk];W[hm];B[hp];W[fl]C[reid: pushing into the knights move like this is aji-keshi.
White doesn't need to play here, so he should just leave it.]
;B[fk];W[ek];B[ej]C[reid: Black says "Thank you." :-)];W[jq]
;B[dm]C[reid:  This move is also unnecessary.  Better to leave it.]
;W[dn]C[reid: Now white says "Thank you" :-)];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[bp];B[bo];W[ao];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[cp]
;W[cs];B[al];W[il]C[reid:  These last two moves are very significant.  Black is trying
to attack the weak white group.  Black wants to extract the maximum
value from the attack.

In most attacks, the attacker has at least two possible directions.
In this case, black can either steal an eye (a8) or surround on the
outside (j8, k8, or k7).  Blacks job is to play the most valuable
move.

In this game, the black group at c9 will have no trouble getting life
even without taking a stone at b8.  On the other hand, black might be
a bit concerned about the weakness at j4, etc.  Black has also invested
some effort in building up the right side.

To me, a surrounding move around k7 would be a nice way to deal with
all of the strategic elements of the current position.

There is a semi-proverb that says "run before living".  Here black is
forcing white to run out into his moyo, essentially forcing white into
following the advice of the proverb.];B[ko];W[lp]C[reid: this exchange is a bit aji-keshi.  It might seem that white
is now over-concentrated here, but then almost anything white plays
in this area will make him over-concentrated, so I think black should
wait on this move.  Now the cut at j4 much more significant.

Jumping to k7 would still be pretty good, I think.];B[kl];W[ip]
;B[io];W[ho];B[ir];W[jr];B[go];W[hn];B[ds];W[bs];B[er];W[lo]
;B[jm];W[ln];B[im]C[reid:  A misread by both sides, perhaps?  l8 breaks the cranes-nest
tesuji, so black doesn' need to help white strengthen with this exchange.
So white m6 isn't sente.];W[hk];B[gl];W[hl];B[kj];W[hi];B[hg]
C[reid:  Here is another significant strategic turning point.  If we divide
the board on a diagonal from a19 to t1 and count the territory in the lower
left half, it looks like white is maybe 10 points ahead.  But in the upper
right half, black is hugely ahead.  Black should be thinking about how to
wrap up his win with a steady progression,  he doesn't need to run any risks.

Black can simply continue to expand his moyo in a nice safe way with a move
like k12.  The white group is still not quite safe, and white isn't going to
be able to build up his territory any more.  Black can coast.

By the way, now we can see the damage caused by white f8 and e9.  This black
group is perfectly positioned to prevent white from making a large territory
in the upper left.];W[gh];B[dg];W[df];B[eg];W[ch];B[gg];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[ij]C[reid: Eh?  White can eat this stone with k10, giving him his second eye.]
;W[hj];B[jj];W[hh];B[bm];W[an];B[fc];W[fh];B[fg];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[ei];B[di];W[fi];B[gj]C[reid: Again, surrounding and forcing white to make his second eye
might be more valuable for black.  Especially since white hasn't
answered f17!];W[bi];B[dk];W[gm];B[em];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[ed]
;W[dc];B[lg];W[ig];B[ii];W[ih];B[jf]C[reid: I think this is too close to white's strength.  Of course white
will respond by pushing between this stone and the g13 group.  Black
would do better to respect the strength and pull back to j15 or l15
instead.  Or black d15, w c15, b e14 atari would be pretty thick for
black too.  Then see what white does.];W[if];B[gd];W[ef];B[he]
;W[ie];B[id];W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[hd];W[kc];B[jb];W[kd];B[ib]
;W[od]C[reid: Suddenly, in just a few moves, white has stabilized his burdensome
group and he's in a good position to reduce black's moyo.  The blame for
this can be found in black k14, I think.

In a larger sense, this is an example of amari-gatachi.  Amari-gatachi
translates loosely as "exhausted shape".  It's what can happen when
attacking a group that doesn't die.  Once the attack is over, the attackee
has a living group, and the attacker has a bunch of thin positions that
can't stand up to the now thick opponent positions.  It's more or less
the strategic counter-part of aji-keshi.

One must be very careful when attacking.  It's much easier to live than it
is to kill.  The attack feels great as long as you can push the other guy
around, but if it runs out of steam, you may not have enough power left
to finish the game.];B[le];W[kf];B[ke];W[je];B[pf];W[on];B[pn]
C[reid: q7 looks a bit better than q6.  Get out ahead if you can.]

;W[de]C[This is a fatal mistake allowing B to play 'a', which saves the B stones and kills
the large W group.  Without this mistake I judge B to be about 2 points ahead.

reid: So white should play g15 instead of d15.  then b d15, w c15 and probably
b t4 is the biggest reverse-sente (which means black probably gets t3 too).
White a7 is sente as is l12.  Black probably answers white d5 too, then white
p4 is biggest?  n19 and e19 cancel and a11 and f1 cancel (sort of).  I'm not
sure who's going to get k19 first, but it looks to me like it's going to be
a 1/2 pointer.  Perhaps the ko at b8 would decide the game.

In this game, black got an early lead, but then got into trouble through too
vigorous attacking.  Black shows that he understands the importance of attack
and defense, strength and weakness in the middle game.  Now he needs to refine
his sense of when to attack so as to gain the greatest benefit.]
