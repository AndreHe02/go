white won (W+31.5)   review requested by Florreke


Rolf -   Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review your game.  Keep in mind that I am far from a Dan level player, so take the advice for what it is worth :-)

If you have any questions on the comments I made I would be glad to answer them or give you additional comments on any new issues that you may have.    Overall I thought you played a good game.  White did a good job of playing under you in the areas in which you were trying to secure territory on the sides and still prevented you from controlling the center.  However, you gave up sente a little too often for moves that were not urgent.

Please forgive the many typos, as I was short of proofreading time and I'm a lousy typist.

better than E17.

[bw\]
E17 wasn't a bad move and G17 would not  have  been especially helpful in view of how the game developed.

However, I probably would have played my third move in the top right corner at either o17 or p16.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md]C[[bw\]
Your next move here is at j17.  This is probably a too conservative and allows white to settle his group easily. (see var)]

(;B[ic]C[J17 to give the white N16 group less =
room to develop.
[bw\]
Good thinking.  However, it allows white an easy extension to settle his group. see var]
;W[kc];B[qf]C[[bw\]
I originally thought that that r14 was too close of an extension for this scenario and thought  Q14 or r13 would have been better.   Maybe even q10.  However, the pattern that black played was joseki, so I am not sure my suggestions are valid. ........

In looking forward several moves, your moves were nice and solid; however, they all set up strong moves for your opponent.  Try to use moves that threaten your opponents plans at the same time.]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[qh];B[cn]C[[bw\]
I don't think I like this move; however, I'm not sure of better alternatives at this point.   This move allows white to settle both his groups easily.]
;W[fq];B[ck]C[C9 is solid, but maybe D1=
0 had been bigger.

[bw\]

yes but it would have left you open to an invasion];W[ch];B[lq]
;W[kq];B[lp]C[M4 good ? R3 better ?

I think m4 is good.  While r3 would protect your corner, it would also allow white to make great shape by taking m4 and your move at m3 would hav every little value. (see var)]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[pr]C[[bw\] Your next move is s3.  I think your best move at this point would have been to move at o4 or o3 to preven white from linking up on the bottom.  White will live in the corner, but don't let him link up.  It also would have had the advantage of building some influence on the right side.]

;B[pl];W[rm]C[[bw\]
It seems like you were a little soft on this side and white walked away with a lot of territory.  I have included a couple of possible variations for you consideration.  You have a lot of influence with your wall and you have to keep that in find when thinking on how to respond to attacks in that area.

[bw\]
Hmm.... I  don't think this move advanced your position enough.  It just allowed white to strengthen his position and leave him with  a great move at b10.]
;W[dh];B[hf]C[Good idea getting out into the center.  However, ou may want to consider trying to utilize the influence you built up in the lower right.  Perhaps a move at k7 or k10.]
;W[kf];B[kd];W[ld];B[jc];W[lc];B[je]C[[bw\]I think this move was a little too defensive and it allows white to build some influence in sente, which is never good.]
;W[ke];B[jd];W[ff];B[kn]C[[bw\] l9 ara would have been better because it utilizes the influence better.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[kj];B[mk];W[li];B[mj];W[kh]C[Your next move was at m8.  I think l9 would have been better.  It makes a few points difference and those things add up.]

(;B[ll];W[kk]
(;B[gp]C[G4 was meant to separate the K4 stones from the F3 stones, but maybe J4 h=
ad been a better a idea to accomplish that.
[bw\]
I don't think j4 would ended in a better result in unless white made a mistake.  I have included several variations on cuts for you to think about.

However, as a general rule you should not try to cut  groups of stones that could each live individually as a group, which I think is the case here.

The best scenario for this type of cut would have been  if you had steered white to the right at the corner by taking q3 instead of r4.  This would have allowed white a few more points on the right but would have set up an attack on the 2 white stones at k4 and l3 since they could not have linked up with white bottom right group.]
;W[gq];B[dr];W[cr];B[eq];W[ep];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq];B[fp]
C[[bw\]This cut  was a wasted move.  Your stones at e3 can easily be captured to connect the white groups, so your move is really not a threat.]

No need to connect here.  If white takes the two stones you can immediately take the one back.  I think it would be better to keep sente.  Perhaps a move at p14]

C[F15 ??  Had to be B16. Or F16.

[bw\]
Yes I think you are right.  Either of those moves would have been better.  However, b16 is much bigger.  b16 is probably worth at least a 10 pt difference.]
;W[ee]
(;B[gf]C[G14 ? Better F16.
[bw\]
Yes, right again.  :-)];W[bc]C[[bw\]I think you should have responded at b18.  It is worth more to stop white from rounding the corner than it is to protect your stone at f15.]

e2 does not gain you much.  You are still 2 stones behind in liberties.]

(;B[jr]C[[bw\]
Good try, but there just isn't enough of an opening there for black to attack.   
One is ofter better off by trying to maximize endgame sente moves instead of desperation attacks.]

te, making me lose another 10 points or so. The game is certainly over now.=
 I think I had to go for the center, instead of attacking the white groups,=
 making them stronger.
[bw\]Yes, I think your analysis is generally correct.

This last set of moves allowed white to take sente and sealed the game.

White did a good job of playing under you in the areas in which you were trying to secure territory on the sides and prevented you from controlling the center.  However, I belieive that the game was much closer than the final score indicated.]
