Arister: Hi. I am black in this game. Not exactly a "fair" game as you will see (I am dramatically underranked), but it's the first game in a while I can't find the mistakes I've made. Thanks in advance for your insight.

Hello,
I think you played well.  However I think you played some correct moves a little later than was safe.  Against a better player this could be taken advantage of to possibly change the outcome of the game.  I'll point some out.]

See variation.];W[bq];B[eq];W[cr];B[cm];W[bm]C[White shouldn't be wasting time with this move since the group is already safe.  Instead white should be going after some bigger territories preventing black from making use of that springboard to extend from (the black wall on the bottom).]

Arister: That move forced him to crawl on the second line later on. Was there a better move?
***

I think a better move would be exposing the weakness in the bottom right.  In this part of the board, however, I think this might be a move for later in the game.  If white crawls on the second line he gets one point for each stone while black gets a solid wall (much more valuable as you can see how useful the wall on the bottom left was).]

;W[dj]C[This is a very important part of the game.
The white group in the center might live.  You can kill it so you should do so since it is large and it essentially secures the middle bottom half of the go board.
To kill it I suggest the variations]

Arister: Here. ;)
Still, was L7 bigger?

In answer to your question about crawling on the secon dline.  I think white shouldn't have done so since the group was alive.  Perhaps using the white stone at D16 would have been best.  (Extending from it).
However at this point in the game I'd say black has too much power and too much territory for suggest a useful attack for white.]

Arister: I believe this move made the group quite safe  --white has two unsettled groups nearby, after all--but I can't read very far.

I think the black group is still qutie unsafe.  See variation.]

Arister: That was unforeseen, but it turned out to be alright anyway. Should I have played differently?
***

That is a hard question to answer.  I think most of the moves were forced  moves so probably just ensuring the white group was dead earlier would have been the best thing to do.  (There was a comment on this previously at 70).]
