C[i would like some general pointers regarding approaching invading and mid game strategies

(in mail) i recently started learning about joseki and was tryin to apply them... however i dont exactly remember too many or any of the variations.
i realize that my mid game is weak as i dont know where to attack and the sequence after the initial invasion

[JB\] Hi. I hope I can be of help.
First of all, at your level you do not need to know too many joseki, neither many variations. Also, if you plan to improve, try to play stronger players with proper handicap. In this case the possible joseki are much less... You should try a favorite opening also and learn some joseki for that situation.
Just by playing blind joseki will not help you, but I understand you may feel more comfortable on known paths.
During the opening I will show you just a few common joseki that you may want to learn.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]LB[de:a]C[[JB\] This is a well known fuseki called "ni-ren-sei" (I like it and I play it quite often). Now black usually would play at A (see Var.2)]

(;B[cq]LB[cl:a][fn:b][hq:c]C[3-3invasion

[JB\] It is too early to invade at san-san: this invasion leads to a small black corner completely sealed by white.
You should invade at san-san to take some points later in the game, when white influence to the center or the sides is not important or, in general, when you see that white influence will be of no use (because white is strong in the A-B-C area yet or because you are).]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq]C[i believe its a standar joseki up to this point... not certain as i only learned them this weekend

[JB\] Yes, but now B has to play A (see var.2)]
(;B[gr]C[[JB\] Black G2 is wrong: white gets a lot of influence and you just get 1 point per stone... too small in this stage of the game.]

(;W[pf]LB[qf:a][nc:b][nd:c]C[[JB\] White should have played H3 to prevent black there.
Though the more common approach to hoshi (star point) is keima (A or B) this one (or C) is quite common too. Other approaches are rarely used and depend on the circumstances.
See Var.2 for a common joseki after A.]
(;B[of]LB[nd:a][pj:b]C[[JB\] Ishida says: "In the local context, answering at A gives black a favourable result. A position in which this answer is not appropriate is almost inconceivable". In some cases (and probably this is one) B can be an alternative; see variation 2 for a joseki after A.
Of course you do not need to know this. But a contact play on the outside (towards the center) is probably not good. A contact move will make your opponent stronger and you will not get too much on the top side (it is wide open).
See variation 3 for a joseki with contact when the corner is in komoku.]
;W[pn];B[on]C[[JB\] Same as before.];W[ce];B[fc]LB[jd:a]MA[dc]
[ce]C[im not sure this approach is correct

[JB\] I am not sure too. When white has the marked stones he wants to play near A, so a move to prevent this is good. But I think it is too close; maybe near A would be good and make a good balance with the stones at Q16 and P14.]
;W[dl]LB[dk:a]C[[JB\] A, one point above, looks better. You usually play at 3 points from a 2-stone wall, but in this case white has more stones there and A has good balance with the white stones at C15 and D17.]
;B[bp];W[bo]
(;B[ap]LB[bq:a][bn:b]C[i realize this was a bad move

[JB\] Yes, usually you would play A locally. But you have better choices in the board: white did not respond to P14 and P6, and your stone at F17 needs some support (something like F15 would help F17 while keeping white low on the side, see var.2)
Anyway, since white tenukis (it looks like he likes to), you have a very big yose move at B to play later.]
;W[hc]
(;B[bq]C[[JB\] No need for this, see Var.2];W[gd];B[fd]C[[JB\] After leaving F17 alone now you try to save it... when a stone has no escape it is better to use its aji to get something in other place. Your opponent is not so strong either, so you save it finally.]
;W[fe];B[gc];W[hd];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cc]
(;W[ed]LB[ee:a]C[[JB\] This is a mistake. Most moves which leave an empty triangle are.
Notice that A works better (Var.2): the weakness there helps black a lot.]
;B[ea]C[[JB\] This does not help to live, but as I said your opponent helps you.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ac];B[ab]
(;W[lc]LB[ba:a]C[[JB\] He could have made things quite difficult for you by playing at A... see var.2.]
;B[fb]LB[ba:a]C[[JB\] I understand you but again it would have been better to play A directly.]
;W[cd]LB[ee:a]C[[JB\] White had to play here because of the weakness he left at A.]
;B[ba];W[nq]C[[JB\] I do not like this one. White is making Q6 weaker and there is not a lot of territory on the low side due to G2.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[op];W[jq]C[[JB\] Anyway, white got more influence...]
;B[hq];W[hp]
(;B[iq]LB[ep:a][gp:b]C[[JB\] It may be better to try to exploit the weakness at A and B (Var.2)]
;W[ip];B[ir]C[[JB\] Not needed (tooooo small)];W[cn];B[ao];W[an]
;B[jr];W[no];B[oo];W[mm];B[nn];W[mn];B[kr];W[lp]C[[JB\] At this point it would be good to evaluate how you are. See Var.2.]

(;B[jp]C[again im not sure if this cut is good or bad

[JB\] A cut should never be bad, except when you are cutting apart too live groups (in which case you loose time).
If you checked the variation, you may see that this is too small for what you need.]

(;W[kq]C[[JB\] For white, var.2 is better.];B[jo];W[in];B[io]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[fo];B[jn];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[hl];W[hk];B[do]
;W[gl]C[[JB\] White should have played E5, I think (but I did not check)]
;B[ep];W[go];B[co];W[bn];B[fp];W[lf]C[i think there might have been bigger moves than capture

[JB\] Sure. Capture is 6 pts. Q13 is worth more than that, and there are much bigger moves like Q7. You also need to do something with the left white moyo before it is too late... though you reduced it, your K5 stones are lost.]
;B[gp];W[pm];B[en];W[ph];B[fn];W[gn];B[gm]C[i realize i shouldnt have played there... maybe F7 or F8 or another area on the board

[JB\] With such a big moyo like white had, it should have been better to invade than to reduce. Anyway, you suceeded a lot because of some white mistakes.
Now it is time to move to other place, because you cannot reduce much more and white is taking the right side, which should have not been his.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[oe]C[[JB\] White likes to leave things unfinished, but tenuki is an art. Your opponent uses to tenuki whenever, even when it is not good...]
;B[nf];W[ne];B[pe];W[nh];B[mf];W[qf];B[mg]LB[me:a][md:b]C[[JB\] Most empty triangles are not good... if you are close to playing one, consider carefully other alternatives like A or B.
Anyway I am aware that you need to do something at the center (my estimate is more than 20 points difference)]
