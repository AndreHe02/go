(;W[ce]C[(maybe this move is too defensive)

--

"Too defensive" is probably not precisely correct, but Duumvir's concern is likely warranted.  This move by white makes a play around K16 important for both sides, and thus invites black to play there now.

In other words, K16 (or K17) is now a good extension for White.  But it is black's turn, and K16 is also a good move for black.  So by playing C15, White has given Black a chance to play a move that has two purposes.

White might have tried to approach black's upper right corner first at O17 - see variation.]
;B[jd]C[--
Good move by GreenTK - probably the most important move on the board at this time.]
;W[dj]C[--

Perhaps this move, like White's last move, is too slow in development.

I think I would prefer White to play around K4, or G3, which might compel black to play around D10.

But then Black D10 would be in between White at the top and bottom or the left side, and White could probably get a double-purpose attack on black's stones there.

If Black did not enter the left side, then White would at least be developing quickly and staking out influence comparable to Black's.

Regardless, if Black next plays at K4 he will have an imposing position, and perhaps a psychological advantage :)]

(;B[jj]C[--
This move by Black does work with Black's upper right formation, and probably cannot be called bad.  But I would prefer Black at K4 now.

I wonder if Black feels like he is locking up the upper right with this move?

White still has the invasion of R17 to look forward to, and perhaps because of K10 the urgency of White getting there before Black is much higher now.

See variations.];W[jp]C[--

A good choice by White.  This seems to balance the development on the board a bit.   If Black had played K4 on the last move, then white would have a hard time regaining the balance of the game.

So perhaps C15 and K10 balance each other somewhat.  If you remove these stones, the board is roughly equal.  If they were removed, where would black want to play?  Where would white want to play?  Both C15 and K10 are important, so I can't call them bad...]
;B[po]C[--

Solid, but maybe too slow now.  Black would almost enjoy white trying to invade at Q5, since Black could use the fight to strengthen his right side position.

It seems that both players are trying to avoid fighting.  White probably needs to fight however, as black is staking out a bigger portion of the board.

I think for this move, I might prefer Black to play around G17, or perhaps try to reduce white around G4. Q5 is solid though, and black maintains a balance, with his stone at K10 equal to his "lead."]
;W[qf]C[too aggressive?,

--

White needs to find a way to reduce Black, so I don't think trying to play inside is too aggressive.  Perhaps White could pick a better invasion spot, but I am not sure what that would be.

White should be able to at least get some life on this side (reducing black), so I think this is ok.]

(;B[ph]C[Black would probably be better off protecting the corner.  He is already solid on the lower right side, and White's best hope for survival here would be in the corner.

I would prefer black to play at O17, or around R16, or even perhaps Q14, since Black has good support at K16 and Q10.  See variation.]

(;W[rd]C[Probably not a bad way to start trying to get life, but I think White might be better off going straight for R17 now.]
;B[pf]C[Again, I would prefer Black at R17.  If White tries to run for middle, Black will profit in the fight I think.  White can not make a relatively large life in the corner with R17.]

(;W[qg]C[I think this is bad by White. Black could possibly ignore this, and now has a second chance to play R17.

Also, White might try to be more aggressive, such as Q13 - see variation.]
;B[pg];W[qc]C[Good move, if perhaps a bit late.];B[pc]
(;W[hc]C[too far apart?

--
White is strong here, so I think this is not bad.  H17 is an important point.  But I think that Q18 is a forcing move for White and is sente for white, and so should be played first in the top right.  See variation.

Black now has many chances for later gain in the upper right corner.  If White play's Q18 first, then White settles the upper right, gets the big point at H17, and need not worry about the life of the upper right.]
;B[fe]C[should i try to split this stone from the  others? i think this is a good move, but it  seems a bit far away from the others...

--

Black is perhaps stretching too far, and so the F15 stone will be a good target for attack.  Black would be better off to take the M4 point, or try to invade the lower left.]

(;W[hd]C[
I think this is not a high priority move.  H15 would be stronger attack.  White N3 is also good.  Or White C3!

White can undercut black at the top, so I don't think that F15 is a big threat to white.]
;B[dg];W[ch]C[--

There is no need to attach to D13 to attack it.  White at C11 would serve the same purpose as C12, but would be stronger for White.]
;B[gh]C[These moves are not urgent to either Black or White.  Black is reducing a small area in the middle, while White has a hige corner moyo at the bottom left.  White should thank Black and play at C3 or C4 now.]
;W[em]C[too far out?

--

Since Black can invade C3 anytime still, I agree that White is playing too far out.  One of the basic principles of the early game is - Corners first, then sides, then middle.

White does NOT own the lower left corner at this time.];B[jn]
C[This balances well with Black on the right. But still, if you count the lower left as territory, then White is ahead in the game due to Black's plays in the middle.  Try to "connect the dots" and guess who owns more territory right now.    Black would be better at C3 or M4.]
;W[ho]C[Again, White is being too greedy and expecting to take the lower left.  White should play C3, D3, or F3 now.]
;B[lp]C[Finally - good for Black.

Now Black looks much better in this game.];W[ie]C[not good, but what else to play?

--

As you can guess from my previous comments, I think White still needs to protect the bottom left.

At the top, White would be better off sneaking under black around K18 or L17.  Now might also be a good time for White Q18.]

(;B[je]C[Black follows White's lead - but should dive into C3.

When black takes C3 and lives, then who is in the lead?  See variation.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[kc]C[It is probably too late for this move - but the idea is good.  White should have invaded here sooner.  At this time, White would probably do better with a more consdervative invasion at K18.

White also still needs to leverage a play at Q18.];B[jc];W[nc]

(;B[mb]C[Hmm.  I think Black should use this opportunity to get a double attack going, since White has left R18 open for Black.  See variation.]
;W[nb]C[I don't think this move helps the fight for White.]
;B[pb];W[pe]C[Dangerous for White.]
(;B[oe]C[Black is conservative.  I think atari at R15 is good attack for black.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[ja];B[ia];W[ka];B[hb];W[fb]C[White is correct to protect the upper left this way.  But If White had seen that he would eventually need to do this sooner, then he would not have invaded at L17.]
;B[qe]C[Weak.  There is no reason to take this stone yet.

Much better to play R16, or R12.];W[re];B[ii];W[kd]C[I think this is throwing good stones after bad.  This group probably never had a chance to live.]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[na]C[Black better at N16 now.  This move gives White a chance to live.]
;W[oa];B[pa]
(;W[ob]C[White could play N19 now and live.];B[le]C[M16 or N19 live for White now.]
;W[ld];B[cn]C[Black better to invade at C3.

Black will get small live in corner, but ruin White's territory.  The strong wall that White would get from the fight will be useless and redundant to White's stones at E7 and H5.

This is why White should have played in the corner earlier instead of E7 and H5.]
;W[cp]C[Good response];B[bj]C[I think if White stays connected, Black's invaders should die.]
;W[cm]C[This starts the last fight of the game, which White loses, and then resigns (I assume). The tactics in this fight are interesting.

Even if White were to survive the fight, with perhaps Black making only a small life in this corner, then who would be winning?  I think Black has the game won, because his bottom right corner is very large and strong.  White might be able to make a big corner at the top left, if he can capture some black stones at F15 or D13, but that may be wishful thinking.

Although White was lucky to make life with the N17 group, doing so cost White a lot in the top right corner.  Making life there will be difficult.  This is perhaps because White did not connect his top middle group to either the left or the right.  The fight there thus weakened him on both the top right and top left.

Another reason why White lost at the top was because of the moves from J15 to J12.  These moves strengthened Black - which is a bad way to prepare for an invasion.  White seems to have made the mistake of J15 to J12 because he wanted to attack Black F15.  This is bad judgement, because Black F15 is worth much less than the top side.

So I think it was White's fight at the top that lost the game, not really the fight at the bottom left.  If White had been just a bit more conservative and played L17 at K18, then the game might have been more even, depending which player got to the bottom left first.

Overall however, the game seemed evenly matched for most of the game.  Both players got many important points on the board in the early game.  Good play! :)]
