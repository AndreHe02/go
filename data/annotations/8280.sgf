C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game.];B[dd];W[pd];B[dq]
;W[qp];B[cn]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[in hind sight, would D6 have been better at all?

Professionals usually play a kakari at A or B,
but this move and D6 are also good.];W[cf]TR[pd][cn]C[I think a kakari from the other side would be better because it works more together with the  marked white stone. The proverb advices to play away from strength and the marked black stone on the third line is strong.]
;B[gd]LB[fc:A][fd:B][di:C]TR[cn]C[A and B are more usual extensions, but this is probably also playable. Black could also think about a pincer around C, this would at the same time be an extension from the marked stone.]
;W[cj]LB[ci:A][cl:B]TR[cn][dq]C[It압 probably a little dangerous to play this three space extension with the strength of the marked stones. I think a two space extension at A would be better because it압 safer and it also leaves room for another two space extension to B.]
;B[ch]C[Good. This makes things difficult for white.];W[ef]
;B[eh]LB[di:A][bh:B]C[The move at A is probably better because now white has an option to connect his stones at B. See variation.]
(;W[dl];B[gg]
(;W[gf]LB[bh:A][fg:B]C[White should have connected at A now. If white wants to move out, it압 better to start at B. See variation.]
;B[hf];W[ge]LB[bh:A]TR[gf]C[i felt as thought the correct move would have been B16, or some sort of atempt to run outside. thoughts?

This move doesn앖 seem to work so well, but I don앖 see a continuation of the marked move that does. It압 a difficult situation. I think that linking up the two weak groups at A is still the best white can do]
;B[he];W[ee]C[White압 moves are too passive. This makes it easy for black to shut white in.]
;B[ed]C[Black is building territory and strength while white is only busy saving his stones.]
;W[cg]C[White should link up. This move will destroy that possibility.]
;B[dg]LB[dh:A][ci:B][bh:C]C[This move should be at A or B. Now white can still link up at C.]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[fe];B[gc]TR[fd][fe][fc]C[The exchange of the two white stones for the two black ones has only made black stronger.]
;W[fg]
(;B[gh]LB[fh:A][fi:B]C[Should be at A. If white now pushes at A and black defends at B then black has more cutting points.]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[eg];B[be]LB[ci:A]C[This move takes a big corner, but it is more important to prevent the connection of the white groups at A.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[bf];B[bd];W[ei]C[could B12 not have saved the entire group?

Yes, but this move also saves the group.];B[dh]
(;W[di]LB[bh:A]TR[ch][dh][eh][dg]C[If white played at A the marked stones would be captured. See variation.]
;B[de]TR[di]C[Black punishes the mistake of the marked move very well.]
;W[df];B[bh];W[bi];B[af]C[Good.];W[ag];B[ah];W[ae];B[bg];W[ai]
;B[af];W[dp]TR[fi][gh][gg][hf][he]C[was this something i should have responded to?

No, you played the correct move. The ko is worth about 60 points plus some more because the marked stones get stronger if black wins.]
;B[ff];W[cp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[fo];B[hp]LB[cq:A][do:B]C[Black should first play at A, threatening to cut at B.]
;W[cq];B[dr]LB[op:A]TR[dq]C[Black can play somewhere else, perhaps a kakari at A. If white wants to capture the marked stone, it will be in gote.]
;W[cr]
(;B[gp]C[Again, this move is not so important. See variation.]
;W[jq]C[Good. It압 difficult for black to find a good response.]
(;B[iq]LB[jo:A]C[This is just what white wants. Black spends many stones for only a few points while white gets stronger on the outside. Perhaps black could try A. See variation.]
;W[jp];B[qf];W[qi]LB[nc:A]C[Because of the black thickness in the upper left I think it압 better for white to play more safely at A instead of this pincer.]
(;B[rd]LB[of:A]C[Black should separate white압 stones with A. Then black can try to attack them and use his thickness. See variation for an example.]
;W[pf]
(;B[qe]LB[qg:A][qf:B][rd:C][qe:D]C[A works better to separate white압 stones. Also, if B and D were already in place black would not think of playing C, but if D would be at A then C would become a more natural move.]
;W[pe];B[nc]LB[qc:A][ph:B]TR[qf][qe][rd]C[This seems to be the wrong direction. It is usually a good idea to drive your opponent towards your thickness. This move seems to drive white away from black압 thickness and also invites white to make the make the markes stones weaker.

Black should play A to make the marked stones strong and if the marked stones are strong then black threatens to cut at B. So white will probably defend against it and then black has a chance to invade the white potential in the lower right.]
;W[jd]LB[md:A]TR[gc][gd][he][hf][pd][pe][pf]C[The proverb says: "Play away from thickness".
I assume the intention is to attack the black stone, but the marked black stones are much stronger then the marked white ones and it's black's move. So it's more likely that this move becomes a target for a black attack.

A would be a better move for white. It limits the amount of territory that black can make at the top side and it strengthens the marked stones at the same time.]
;B[ld]C[Good.];W[jf]LB[pg:A]C[White gives black a target to attack. White should ignore black압 move and play A or something like it.]
;B[qn]LB[mf:A]TR[jd][jf]SQ[pd][pe][pf]C[This is not the time to play tenuki. Black should play at A. That keeps the pressure on the the triangled stones, the squared stones begin to look weak and the black group in the middle is in no danger.]
;W[nq];B[qk];W[qg];B[rg];W[ph];B[ok]LB[mf:A]C[the point A is still very important.]
;W[lf]C[Good. This move makes the two white groups work together and it threatens the two black stones.]
(;B[oo]LB[ke:A]C[I think black should play at A to prevent a serious attack on the two stones. See variation.]
;W[oq];B[lo];W[lp];B[mo];W[fl]LB[ke:A]C[This was a chance for white to defend against A.]
;B[ni]LB[ke:A]C[Should be at A.];W[le]C[Good. Now the situation becomes difficult for black.]
(;B[md]C[It압 probably better to connect to the stones on the left. See variations.]
;W[rh]LB[kd:A]C[This move makes nice eye shape, but it would be better for white to play A and prevent a connection of the black stones.]
(;B[sg]TR[rg]C[It압 better not to defend the marked stone. Black should make the group alive by taking the corner and threatening to connect. If white prevents the connection then black gets sente to save his other stones. See variation.]
;W[sh];B[se];W[pb]C[Good double attacking move.]
(;B[rb]LB[jc:B][qc:A]C[Black should peep in sente at A to make his group stronger and then save his other stones with B. See variation.]
;W[kd]TR[nc][md][ld]C[Good. Makes nice shape and kills the marked stones I think.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[kb];W[jb]
(;B[nb];W[lb];B[lc];W[mb];B[ma];W[la];B[ka];W[qd]LB[ne:A]C[This move should be at A. Now black may have a chance to sacrifice the corner and save his group. See variation.]
(;B[pc];W[qc];B[oc];W[qb];B[rc];W[na];B[oa];W[ma]C[This move is useless. Black had one eye at the top and he still has one eye at the top.]
(;B[od]LB[ne:A]C[This move should be at A. That would make miai of escaping and making a second eye.]

;W[hn];B[qo];W[rp];B[pp];W[pq];B[ro];W[mq]LB[hn:A]C[i completely forgot all about this move a while ago.

Yes, black should have played there after white played the marked stone.]
;B[kp];W[lq];B[jo]LB[ko:A]C[The point A is better. Black has to play there anyway sometime and if A is in place this move is very small.]

Locally it압 the best move. The move at A is also large. I think A may be a little bigger, but I앐 not sure.]

Yes, you played well. You cannot expect to capture white, but maybe white will have to spend a few moves capturing your stones.]
;W[ao]LB[al:A]C[The easiest way for white would be to capture the black stone at A, but this is also possible.]
