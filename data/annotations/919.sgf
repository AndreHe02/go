(;B[ci]LB[ef:a][cc:b][fc:c][fd:d][ch:e]C[This move is in completely the wrong direction.  There are a number of options available as shown in the variations from 'a' to 'd'. This move just strengthens the solitary stone W6 without really help B much.  B ends up confined to a small live on the side while W stretches his position on both sides.  If B is going to play in this direction 'e' would be better and there are rare situations (not here) where is is appropriate.  However, B should stick with one of the joseki moves 'b', 'c' or 'd'.]
;W[cj];B[bi]LB[bd:a]C[Diving down to the edge so early in the game are rarely good.  That is one thing that makes B7 such a bad move.  This shape should be reserved for emergency situations where you must live small or die. 'a' is probably the best shape move here, but then the B7-W8 exchange is bad for B]
;W[cn]LB[be:a]C[W should not worry to much about these two stone just yet.  They can easily run out into the center. Much better to confine B with 'a']
;B[cp]LB[bp:a][gq:b][fc:c]C[Very bad shape. If B is going to play towards the corner 'a' is better, but it leave him open along the lower edge so it is not really that good.  Simply playing at 'b' is the best shape locally.  However, since W ignored the top B should consider playing there himself. I would play 'c'.]
;W[en];B[ep]LB[fp:a][gq:b]C[Very heavy. 'a' is the correct shape is B palns on trying to attack the W group, 'b' is he does not plan to attack.  Make note of this comment - implicit in it is the assumption that B must be thinking ahead about the way he hopes the game will go.  Even this early he make a different move depending on whether he is planning an attack or not.]
;W[ce];B[be]LB[df:a]C[Probably better at 'a'.];W[bd];B[bf]LB[df:a]
C[Letting W get 'a' is too good so B cannot afford to connect.  This, in turn, means that B15 was too early..]
;W[df];B[dg];W[di]LB[ef:a]C[W must play 'a'.  Letting B get the atari there is too good for B.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[eh];W[dh];B[ch];W[fd];B[jp];W[gq]LB[pj:a][jc:b]
[pm:c][op:d]C[This is a terrible invasion.  There are vast areas of the board just waiting to be claimed and W starts a petty little fight over a few points on the edge. EAch of 'a' thru 'd' would be better choices for W.  The best W can expect from this is a small territory on the edge in gote, thus depriving B of maybe 20 pts.  But 'a' is worth a lot more than this.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[go];W[fo];B[fp]C[Excellent combination by B.  This shows how inappropriate W's invasion was.]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[ip];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[gr];B[fn]LB[ir:a]C[B hrows it all away with this move.  He must save his 3 stones in order to preserve his territory.  If he plays at 'a' W cannot block so the 3 W stones are captured and with it B secures over 20 pts of solid territory.  Not only that, W is left with floating stones.]
;W[ir];B[eo];W[em];B[jq]LB[oq:a][nc:b][qf:c]C[Another heavy move.  What can this possiblity achieve?  The W stones are as good as alive so this move cannot be an attempt to capture.  Being up to close to a strong W group it cannot be expected to surroujnd any territory.  All it succeeds in doing is filling in b's own liberties.  B should play one of 'a', 'b' or 'c'.  'a' would prevent a W approach move but is slow.  'b' or 'c'', allowing the W approach below are faster paced.]
;W[jo]LB[op:a][pj:b][jc:c]C[This move is just heavy as B45.  It serves no purpose as the W stones are already alive. 'a', 'b' and 'c' are all moves W should be considering.]
;B[mq]LB[oq:a]C[Too far away from B1.  W can invade later.  The 2 B stones to the left are useless and should not be saved.  Better to hold back to 'a' if B is going to play here, but an approach at the top right is probably better.]
;W[hn]LB[gm:a]C[Same comments as before.  Just adding unnecessary stones to a settled postion.  However, this isn't quite as bad as the other moves as this does prevent a B atari at the same point and it also implies a followup move at 'a' to convine B]
;B[qj]LB[qf:a]C[At last!  However, B is behind in this game so this move is a bit slow.  Playing at 'a' is probably overstretching, but is also probably necessary to try to redress the balance.]
;W[pq]C[Totally inappropriate.  Probably even worse that B28.  W seems to have a reluctance to let B take any territory.  This is the wrong approach - he should be trying to make large scale territories in the open parts of the board instead of scrapping over these little edge territories.]
;B[pp];W[oq];B[op];W[nq];B[np];W[mr]C[Wonderful for B.  W invaded far too early and gave B tremendous thickness in exchange for a few points.  This would have been an excellent sequence for W later in the game but at this stage B can make too much out of the thick wall he creates.]

(;B[lq]C[Better at 'a'.  See the variation.];W[lr];B[kr];W[qq]
LB[mp:a]C[W's gain in the corner (as compared to the last variation) is much better than B's gain on the outside. Connecting to the 2 stones B27 & B45 is no big deal and B still as a cutting point at 'a' to worry about.]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[sr];B[nm]LB[oj:a][nj:b]C[Badshape for two reasons.  It bears no relationship to the stone B49 and W can easily come between them.  Also, it is far to close to the B wall.  The proverb says "stand 5, extend 6" or, in general, extend one more than the sizxe of the wall.  Here B should extend to 'a', or maybe even 'b'.]
;W[hl]C[Too small.  The top is the large area.];B[qf]C[Nice extension.]
;W[nd]LB[mc:a]C[The high move here is usually reserve for when W want to later attack the approach move.  Here he is better to paly at 'a']
;B[jc]C[Excellent invasion. B is catching up fast, but he does have 2 weak groups on the board so he cannot afford another one.  He needs to be very careful here.]
;W[pl]LB[pk:a]C[Too deep, as B's response shows.  Should be at 'a']
;B[ok];W[qe];B[rf]LB[pf:a]C[Wrong direction again.  Joseki is at 'a' and there is no reason not to play that.]
;W[re]LB[nb:a]C[The problem with this move is that W is open at the top.  you should never try to make territory where you are open on both sides.  If B now plays at 'a' W will end up with very little.]
;B[pf];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi]LB[lc:a]C[These 2 W stones are very heavy.  W would do better to attack the lone B stone with 'a']
;B[qi];W[of];B[ph]C[Too small];W[oh];B[pg];W[og];B[mc]LB[nb:a]
C['a' is much better shape. This move just helps W seal off his corner.]
;W[nc];B[mb];W[nb];B[gc]LB[fb:a]C[Ditto.  'a' is better.];W[fc]
;B[gb];W[fb];B[md]LB[le:a][he:b]C[Heavy. locally 'a' is better, but palying on the left at 'b' is more useful as it reaches out toward the B stones on the left.]
;W[on]C[This stone cannot live.];B[nn];W[ol];B[nl];W[gd];B[hd]
;W[bq];B[cq]LB[bp:a]C[This is a mistake.  If B blocks at 'a' the W stone cannot connect to the right.]
;W[bp];B[br];W[ar];B[bs];W[ds]LB[bo:a]C[Clearly a mistake.  W must play at 'a' and force B to live in gote.]
;B[bo];W[co];B[ap];W[bn];B[aq];W[ko];B[kp];W[qn]C[Still cannot live.]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[ql];W[me];B[le];W[mf];B[lf];W[id];B[hc];W[if]
;B[he];W[ie]LB[ih:a]C[W is trying too hard. These stone may become a liabiltiy which allows B to win. Best to abandon W122 as kikashi and jump away to 'a'.  After all, for B to cut off  W122 is gote.]
;B[kd];W[lg]C[The first order of business should be to look after the 3 W stones just played.  This move force B to block them to the right and W gains little in return. They are already blocked to the left so this move severaly jeopardizes the stones.]
;B[kg];W[hf]LB[ih:a]C[Must be at 'a' to try to connect to W66.  B's next move is an excellent move which takes good advantage of this mistake.]
;B[hh];W[fg];B[eg];W[ih];B[hg]LB[ii:a][lh:b]C[This is a mistake, creating damezumari for B. Better you be to play at 'a'.  B has the atari at 'b' in reserve if he needs it.]
;W[ig];B[gf]C[This move is too timid as it lets W off too easily.  However, it is consistent with B135.]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[mg];B[li];W[ki];B[lj]C[These last three moves by B were of little value. They strength the W group to the left but gain very little for B because of the strong W stones to the right.]
;W[kf]LB[hi:a]C['a' is better.  This move is only needed if the W stones get into trouble. 'a', on the other hand has territory potential in the middle.]
;B[ke];W[jf];B[kj];W[kl]LB[bj:a][ff:b]C[This is not as big as it looks.  W gains maybe 4 pts and prevent B from taking 4pts.  But it is gote for both players so it is very small. 'a' is much bigger, being worth at least 8pts because it also has some offensive potential against the B group above -- B has to give up some thing if W later plays 'b'.]
;B[jj];W[ii]LB[hi:a]C[Again, 'a' looks better.  This point is dame.]
;B[ji];W[jh];B[ij];W[hi];B[gh];W[gi];B[ei];W[ej];B[hj];W[gj]
;B[gm]LB[fa:a][na:b][se:c][ad:d][bk:e]C[Not very big. B should tgake his 4 sente plays at 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' (it is very hard for W to ignore any of them) and then jump in at 'e'  This would probably seal the win.]
;W[hm]
(;B[mk]C[Black has nothing to worry about here. See the variation.]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[no];B[oo];W[lo]C[W has gain almost nothing from this exchange.]
;B[pn];W[om];B[pk]C[Unnecessary. W has no threat.];W[bj]LB[ga:a]
[fa:b]C[About time.  This has been the big play for a long time. However, being playing it, W should play at 'a' in sente.  'a' (or 'b' for B) is only 2pts but it is absolute sente for both players and so is a free move.]
;B[ai];W[aj];B[ge];W[ad]C[B should have played this before B175.  If W ignores it then 175 is unnecessary.]
;B[ae]LB[fa:a][na:b][se:c]C[1pt in reverse sente - almost the small move on the board. B still should be aiming at 'a', 'b', 'c']
;W[an];B[er];W[es];B[fr];W[fs];B[fq];W[hs];B[dr]C[Another 1 pt in gote.  The three first line hanes are worth at least 2pts each in sente.]

C[W won this game by 5.5 pts.  B lost 4pts absolutely by playing B195 and B197 instead of hane in each case.  He also lost another 2pts absolutely (and possible 4pts is W retreats as he shouLD) by not playing at 176 in sente.   Both players played many small 1 and 2 pt moves when these big sente plays were on the board. This was the difference in the game.]
)
(;C[Assume that B does not play here.  The following is the best W can do and it can be seen that it does not work.]

LB[lr:a]C[Black gets to seal W in and also takes the corner.  Much better than in the game.  The sacrifice at 'a' is a standard technique.]
))
(;B[ef];W[fd]LB[di:a][bd:b][cc:c][bi:d]C[This is not really very good with the wide pincer at W6 but is a standard move if the white pincer is one point closer at 'a', in which case B then continues with Bb, Wc, Bd.  With this wider pincer about the best that B can do it to continue as shown.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ch]C[This is not really a very good shape for B as the B7-W8 exchange is much better for W than for B.  All-in-all, the B play at 7 is not good with the wide pincer.  I only showed it to say how it works with the narrower pincer.]
