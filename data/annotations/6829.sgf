C[Well here's my game, normally I don't play this aggresive but I was feeling lucky. Reviews on the fighting would be greatly appreciated, and thank you so much for your time and willingness to help others :\]

Hello, I think overall you played well, but had a little trouble in finding strong attacking moves in the middlegame. I hope my comments help you.]

;B[fq];W[dj];B[cg];W[ci];B[mc]LB[lc:A]C[I realize that playing ogeima, for both corners isn't normally a good idea, but considering the fuseki I though I'd take a stab at it.

Ideas on the situation would be appreciated.

There's nothing bad about this move. A would be better, to put more pressure on the white stone. The corner is not well protected here anyways, so you should play A without hesitation.]

(;B[qj]C[This is not bad but R6 seems better.];W[jq];B[eb]C[Thought this move would be acceptable, I'm a bit paranoid of my corners, if you could show some other possible moves.

This is exactly why I didn't like the tsuke of E17.];W[qf];B[qe]

R6 is also possible, perhaps a bit better, but also certainly more complicated.]
;W[qo]
(;B[nh]LB[mf:A]C[I don't understand the meaning behind this move. It seems like you're trying to confine White's stones, but it's too loose of a move. I think A would be better.]

;W[qi];B[ol];W[rj];B[rk];W[rh];B[ll]TR[pj][qj]LB[ml:A]C[As you get stronger, you feel that your stones have to do more - be farther apart. However, by playing like this, you give White enough aji to exploit that moves like this are not worth it.
Plus, the marked stones are in a bad position.
A tighter move like A would be much better (capturing White's cutting stones is very important, but more aji than required isn't good).]

[mj][mk][jm]LB[kf:A]C[Is this the best extension? I wasn't sure but it didn't look to bad so I played it.

Sure, this move gives you territory, but it has no offensive reason behind it. It's not unreasonable to assume that even if White plays a reducation move ariund here, Black will get the marked territory, so this move only secure maybe 10 points in gote.
Instead, turning at A to try to seperate white's two groups might be better.

As Takemiya Masaki said, "The player with the most territory doesn't win. The player with the most territory at the end of the game wins."]

I haven't read through every position, but I think I remember lecture where someone said this was a ko wthout a stone at B2. I included a variation, which I believe proves this is so.]

;B[gg];W[df];B[bg]C[And that's the game, fairly short, thank you for taking the time to review it is much appreciated.

It's no problem. I have fun reviewing games. 
For a overview of the game, you seem fairly strong in the opening, but seem to have trouble in the middlegame. To improve, just remember that even a defensive move must have offensive qualities to be good. Pure gote moves are never good.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.])

White played her marked stone on an uninteresting side (since  Black's marked stone is also low - neither side can expect much territory here), while Black built an impressive moyo.
(Black, of course, can also slide in at S4 and drawback with R9 after White R3 - it's just a matter of preference.)]
