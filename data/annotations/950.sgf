AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][dj][pj][jp][jd][jj]C[My questions:

Where are the slow moves, that made me loosing this game?

Where could I do better?

Reviewed by nonny 11k* (Andy Denton)

Greetings.  A high-handicap game can be fascinating.  What Black
must understand is that it will be White's job to create
confusion.  White will frequently make nonstandard plays, even
over-plays, seeking to make Black make an over-play or to
over-defend.  White seeks local battles, counting on a superior
ability in local play.  Instead, Black should play steadily.
Frequently the "standard" response is the correct one.

A secondary, but related point is that Black's play should not
contradict the fact that he starts with all 9 of his stones in a
high position.  Black has built in influence, therefore, and
should use this to remain aggressive.  Black should avoid going
for immediate territory, diving for the corners and sides, as
this is inconsistent with his starting position.];W[nq];B[oq]
;W[np];B[pn];W[lp];B[jq]LB[dn:a][jn:b]C[Iron pillar,
but in the end I got nothing.  Would it have been better to play
at 'a' or 'b'?

"a" is not appropriate, but I do like the potential of "b".
There is nothing inherently wrong with the iron pillar, except
that it doesn't secure the territory to the left.  By extending
only one space from his own two-stone position, White feels that
he can play on the other side of your iron pillar.];W[gp];B[dn]
LB[jn:A][dn:B]C[This move is inconsistent with your
previous move.  Now would be a good time to play A, threatening
white in both directions and keeping white separated.  If white
moves from the right position, then B or elsewhere.  If white at
B or similar position, the corner will be fine.  In either case,
the move here at B is mistimed by at least one move.];W[dq]
LB[cq:A][eq:B]C[hmm.  I don't know how to handle this attack...

Exactly what White is counting on--confusion.

To my eye, either A or B.  B if you are in a fighting spirit and
willing to let White live in the corner, meanwhile applying
pressure to the lone White stone on the outside.  A is more
relaxed.  See possible continuation from A.]
(;B[cp]LB[ep:a][eq:b]C[is 'a' better?  Forces White to go back
at 'b', but White might also decide to hane at C4 and take some
of the left side.

I do not like either this or "a".  Both are far too timid.  Note
how White tenukis from here.];W[pl]LB[nn:a][pr:b][oo:1][jn:c]
[qn:d]C[a common
attack at 9-stone-games.  What's best?  Separate at 'a', or
protect at 'b' (as I did) or any else?

At 11k, I am not strong enough to say what is absolutely best
here (or anywhere, for that matter :)).  I can say, however, that
"b" doesn't really protect anything, and it is not efficient.
"a" has potential, but if we played that, I'd want to make a
two-meaning move to protect against the peep at "1" first.  See
variation for what I mean.

I still like "c"--almost inducing White to force Black to defend
the corner.

It is likely that "d" may be the quietest, best response here.]

(;B[pr]C[As I said, I don't see that this does much, other than threaten
to cut the base out from under the white group to the left.]
;W[pg]C[a classic White confusion move again.  Do you defend the
corner or?];B[nd]C[A reasonable response here.];W[ll]LB[nl:a]
[ln:b]C[Looks like too far in the center.  Is
there anything to make use of this?  'a' or 'b' might be useful
to get a strong wall outside.

No, though I'd never have thought of it, I think this is an
excellent move by White.  White is going about capturing your
iron pillar in big style.  Your next several moves ensure that by
strengthening White here.]
(;B[no]C[Since Black is more or
less settled in the corner area, I do not like this play.  I
think the proper direction is from the other side, the iron
pillar.  See variation from previous move for possible
continuation.];W[mo];B[nn];W[io]LB[jp:a][jq:b][lr:c]C[now my stones
at 'a'/'b' seem to be captured

Yes, for all practical purposes, captured, and in a big way.
Actually, you might be able to save them--starting at "c".]
;B[jm]C[The only place that White is relatively strong
is here.  You should not play where White has influence.  Attack
White's weakest area instead.];W[jo];B[km];W[lm];B[hn];W[hp]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[mn];W[ln]
(;B[nl]LB[nk:a][ok:b]C[better at 'a'?

Neither, needs to be at "b".  You cannot afford to let White
easily capture this stone.  In a very real sense, this is the
difference in the game.];W[ok];B[nk];W[oj];B[ni]C[inevitable to here, but White has no worries here now.]
;W[pi];B[lj]C[I'm not sure where else to play as White has nothing weak, but
I don't like this move.  A central moyo is not assured yet.]
;W[cf];B[ch]C[Wrong side.  Black's potential is much greater
from the other side.];W[fc]
(;B[fd]C[attach the stronger
stone to make the weeker stone weeker (Is this correct here?)

Black's reasoning is correct, but this may not be the best time
to make the contact move.  I'd prefer another joseki.  See
variation from previous move.];W[gd];B[fe]C[Are there better
alternatives?  After the game 'aga' told me that I could have
played stronger in the corners - I think, this is one of the
moves he mentioned.

Given the position, this is not a bad move.];W[cc];B[cd]LB[ec:A]
C[No, For shape reasons alone, must be at "A".];W[dc];B[hc]
LB[df:A][fh:B]C[This does nothing.  Threatening to cut one stone, and an
unimportant (at least, unimportant at this time) one at that.  A
or B are better.];W[ed]LB[gd:A]C[See how White does not
regard the threatened stone at A as crucial?  Pushing through
here makes Black's bad shape even worse.];B[ee];W[ec];B[df]
LB[de:A][bd:B]C[Black should connect solidly at A to avoid B]
;W[bd]LB[cg:A]C[Very painful for Black.  A is
probably the best response.];B[gc]C[One stone in gote at this
point is way too small.];W[bh];B[cg];W[bg];B[bi];W[be];B[cj]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[op];B[oo];W[or];B[pq];W[qd];B[pc]LB[qc:a]C[here again I think I could have played stronger,
but I don't know how.  (Maybe 'a')

Definitely "a".];W[qe];B[pf]C[No, Black needs a noncontact move to]
;W[qf];B[of];W[nh];B[lg]LB[oh:A]C[I aimed at protecting my moyo.

good thinking, but White's play should be considered an
overplay.  Play A.];W[gn]LB[go:A]C[Another overplay
by White.  Black should resist with A];B[gl]C[again I tried to
protect it

Yes, but again too timid.];W[hm];B[hl];W[fm]
(;B[fl]LB[el:A]C[Jump ahead to A instead.  Avoid "pushing the cart from behind"
Compare variation.];W[em];B[el];W[dm];B[cm]C[now it's time to
look after my group at the lower left.];W[bq];B[bp];W[cq];B[cl]
;W[il]
(;B[ik]LB[im:A]C[Again, Black lets White
profit from overplay.  Black should cut at A.  See continuation
from previous move.];W[jl];B[he]LB[gd:a]C[I was not sure, if
the stone at 'a' could do harm, if I would not have catched him
in a geta.

No, there was no ladder for White.];W[ib];B[ic]LB[gb:a][nh:b]
C[again I decided to protect the moyo, but what would white
answer, if I had played at 'a'?

White would try to live on the upper side, counting on fighting
skills.  Or, White might be aiming for mischief with "b".];W[jb]
;B[jc]LB[lc:A]C[Bad shape for Black.  Black needs to
forestall White's march into his territory.  A is better.];W[kb]

Yes, especially as these two stones are captured anyway.];W[li]

white might get into my mojo.

sente-move, when I played there, but I could not answer, nor did

Dame yes, but without it, White will eventually need to lose a
point by connecting at "A"];B[ml];W[tt]TR[jp][jq]C[Before passing I counted the teritories, I lost at 3 Points.  I
asked myself, if I could try to live with those marked stones.
But I decided that this would have no chance and would be
impolite.

I agree that such a move at that point would be impolite, and I
applaud you for not doing so.  However, be aware, many opponents
will attempt it anyway.

In summary, I feel your instincts are headed in the correct
direction.  Avoid making small moves when much larger ones are
available.  End of comments.];B[tt];AE[gd][jp][jq][jm][km][hn]
