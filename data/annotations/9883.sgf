AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello!

I'm Joonas, EGF 1 kyu and will be doing the review for black side. If you have additional questions, you can send them to joonas.pihlajamaa@iki.fi. Let's begin!]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[fc];B[hc];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]
(;B[ce]LB[cb:A]C[This hane (turn at end of stones) is not possible with F17 on the board. It is good to learn how white can take advantage of this (move at A), as it often happens until around 3-4k level. See variation.]

(;W[be];B[cf];W[bf]C[White did not know C18 so black gets nice result. But black must play C13 now.]

(;B[bg]C[This is bad even without F17, now it is really bad.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[ee]C[Comparing the result to the variation move 16, black has much aji here and white has stones at C12, there is a big difference.]
;W[kc];B[ie];W[ib];B[hb];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[ea]LB[pb:A]
[dh:B][cn:C][qn:E][jq:D]C[This is quite small move at this point, black could just ignore and play for example A-E which are all large]
;B[fa];W[da];B[fb];W[dh]C[Here is another good point to play elsewhere, what will happen at the worst locally? White gets D13 stone in gote which is like 1-2 points. Black groups looks easily alive.]
;B[eg];W[qc];B[pc]C[Good direction! separate the invading stones. White should've played somewhere on bottom of the board, not here.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]
(;B[qd];W[rd]C[Unless you continue locally, no need to waste a potential ko threat.]
;B[jb]C[Good plan to attack the stones!];W[nb]
(;B[nd];W[oa]C[Now that white is connected, black cannot build strength while attacking. Also the black shape looks quite bad, I would like to play N16 or Q13 or something just to keep the stones from becoming a burden.

(or a higher level player would just abandon them as they are only 10pts or so).]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[kb];B[jc];W[kd];B[me]C[The last moves are very small compared to the bottom of the board. Black should just give K18 stone and play a huge move elsewhere.]
;W[le];B[pj]C[Good! You were the first to tenuki.];W[qh]
(;B[rf]C[While separating stones is good, you should consider if the move is possible. Otherwise you are just feeding your opponent. See a variation for alternate plans.]
;W[qe]
(;B[pe];W[pf]
(;B[of]C[Seems like black must do this, and cannot save his R14 stones. If that is the case, why play S14 at all?]
;W[pg];B[og]C[After committing to Q16 stones, this is a wise move to make a better shape. O14 also possible.]
;W[oh];B[lf]C[I like this move as well.];W[kf]
(;B[ld]C[Never atari if it is not needed. You lose the peep at K15 you might need later, and a liberty as well.]
;W[ke];B[mg]LB[ld:1][le:2][mg:3]C[See the variation from move 63 regarding 1-2-3 rule -- you should play this (or M13) without the M16 atari.]
;W[nf]LB[ne:B][oe:A][ng:C]C[Time to stop for a second and think what should be played. Atari at A is bad unless you connect P13 stones. Which of the moves A-C looks best?

A looks quite good, if white stone cannot escape. And it can't.

B leaves white a squeeze which takes away an eye. Not good.

C is simple and if you get sealed in, you can live with B later.

A is probably the best, followed by C.]
(;B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[ng]C[After this squeeze, black has no eyes and must escape, giving white great forcing moves. If you can find the squeeze before it happens and avoid it, you can easily become 1 stone stronger!]
;B[mf];W[oe];B[lh];W[mj];B[ig];W[kg]
(;B[lg]TR[mh]C[M13 does not do anything, you should just get out.]
;W[kh];B[li];W[ki];B[lj];W[eh];B[gg];W[fg]C[Obviously black should play at E14 due to double atari.]
;B[ff];W[df]
(;B[ef];W[de]
(;B[fd]C[Another empty move, you can quite quickly read that if white plays here, you can just connect. Every move you avoid is maybe 5-10 points at this stage of the game!]
;W[jd]
(;B[id];W[cn]C[White gets the big move here. Black probably stayed too long at the top, defending a few points. After white is connected with O18 stones, you should just make a mental note that not much points can be gained by either side on top, and move elsewhere.]
;B[fq];W[qn]
(;B[np];W[kq];B[qo];W[on];B[lo];W[hq];B[mk]C[Good!];W[nj]
(;B[nk];W[oj];B[ok];W[pk];B[pl];W[qk]C[This is a nice sequence by black, and almost cuts the white stones. See the variation with peep for possibility to improve even more.]
;B[kj]C[Well noticed!];W[ql];B[pm];W[pn];B[qm];W[rm]
(;B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[ro]
(;B[ll];W[qp];B[qq];W[po];B[op];W[rq];B[qr]C[Black bleeds quite a lot of points here, maybe 15 point loss in a few moves. It would be better to give white the Q7 four stones and take the corner. Don't hang on to heavy stones unless the cut something important!]
;W[en]C[The situation looks rather dim for black at this point, as white got both sides and black got little on the top. Now would be a time to invade something, but black still has several weak groups.]

(;B[jn]C[I think this is quite good move as well, it almost connects bottom and center groups and puts pressure on white.]
;W[ek]
(;B[fh];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[co]C[Nice!];W[bn];B[bo];W[ip]C[Here would be a good place to consider: can I kill white? Looks like white has N2 to make eyespace and H6 to escape, so killing is hard.

In that case, take points and make white run.]
(;B[go];W[mn];B[mo];W[do];B[eo]C[Again, instead of atari, black should probably just play E4]
;W[dn]
(;B[fp];W[mq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[or]
(;B[nq];W[hk]
(;B[hj];W[nr];B[jq]C[Interesting move!];W[jr];B[jp];W[kp]
(;B[ko];W[pq]C[Ouch!];B[lr];W[lq]C[White makes a huge mistake here]

(;B[is];W[kr];B[js];W[ks];B[hs];W[gj];B[hi];W[fn];B[ji]C[Too small, black should play A6 or at leasst G7]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[ao];B[bp];W[ap];B[aq];W[an];B[bq];W[gn];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[fr];W[iq];B[jo];W[mr];B[no];W[nn];B[ln];W[im];B[jm]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[ho];B[in];W[hn];B[il];W[hm];B[hl];W[gl];B[jl]
;W[ja]
(;B[ia];W[ic];B[ha];W[jf]C[Alright! In the end, white wins by a huge margin, mainly due to three reasons:

1) Black had to defend the awkward shape of P16 resulting in white getting top right side in sente

2) A few slow moves to defend the (already quite alive) F16 group gave white the time to play on bottom

3) Black got separeted into 3 unconnected weak groups on the bottom, which let white turn both sides into territory and live on the bottom.

There was a 5-stone strength difference between players so it was not surprising black had hard time in the fights. But if you can spot the situations where heavy clumps of stones like P16 and P8 are formed, and do something else instead, I think you'd be at least 1-2 stones stronger already.

Furthermore, there were a few empty moves that had either little or no point value, doing some go problems (tsumego) to improve your instincts, or just playing a lost and thinking ahead will help you avoid those, and let you improve another stone or two at least.

Hope you got some ideas from the review!
