AB[pd][dp]C[Reviewed by Niall 1k at the request of B.
Niall's comments preceded by "NM"];W[pp]C[I seem to struggle with fuseki. I often feel that when I lose, I lose in the first 50 moves. But I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[de]C[NM: This is OK, but you could also think of a pincer (around D12) or just E16 - given that you have the two neighbouring corners covered.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[cd];B[cc];W[ci];B[hc]C[I could not remember joseki and played too far away. I'm not sure how serious this error is, though.

NM: classically, you only need to reinforce when W has played C13, so that the cut could work. But this is still quite a good move.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[NM: Good! But of course you have to accept you lose the corner.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[gd];B[gc]C[NM: this makes it too easy for W. Better H16 - you can always play F18 later.]
;W[fd];B[ec];W[fq]C[NM: W leaves his G16 group as forcing stones. You could attack, e.g. at E14 or F14.]
;B[cn];W[he];B[le]C[NM: I like this reply.];W[qb]C[Should I have responded at S18 in order to prevent W from making an eye in the corner?
NM: You certainly can, but while the B group is still weak there can be nasty attacks using the agi of S16]
;B[qn];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[sb];B[qk]C[I could have played O3, but I also wanted to reach out to my eyeless group at R16.

NM: This is better than O3. I think I would have gone one further to R10, however.]
;W[qi];B[pi]C[NM: THings will get complicated here. I think I would have played Q12 or P11, but this is playable.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[ph]
(;B[ri]C[NM: No! You have to pull this stone out at P11 and go for the kill, See variation.]
;W[qh];B[og];W[rh];B[sj];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[mg]C[So I changed strategies and connected my two weak groups.
NM: The M17 group is not weak! But this is playable. B has about 20 TL; 10 on R; 12 at BL. W has 8 at TR; 12 at TL; and say about 10 net at B. B is still ahead.]
;W[kd]
(;B[ld]C[NM: I would reply L17 here, see variation.];W[kc]
(;B[ke]C[NM: Why not K15? It seems to me difficult for W to live.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[je];B[jf];W[if];B[jg];W[ro]C[NM: Note that B L18 joins the groups]
;B[rn]C[NM: Almost never the best answer. Better R5, N7, O3...]
;W[dr];B[cq]C[NM: OK, but you could also think of H3.];W[cl]
;B[cr];W[eq];B[kq];W[nq];B[hq];W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[ip]C[NM: I would cut at F4 and damn the torpedoes ... but it could get complex!]
;W[io];B[jp];W[fo];B[mr];W[nr];B[mq]C[NM: No, you really need to get out, and while you still have K5 you shouldn't have too many concerns about the B group. D7 or E6 would be better.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[tt]C[JChiu [6k\]: oops];B[qo]C[(White accidentally passed, but I didn't see his "oops" at first and he didn't ask to undo. I thought at first maybe he needed to quit the game.)

NM: Be that as it may, this is big but not the biggest point on the board. I would play one of: F14, F6, O8, K10, K5, D11 ... My choice would be F14, which is a double threat. (afterwards the cut at C14 works)]
;W[qp];B[cm];W[bl];B[np];W[op];B[no]C[NM: Big, but F7 or F14 are bigger.]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[ol]C[seberle [8k\]: I was wondering!

(I did not see his earlier comment until now, when White misclicked a pass.)]
;B[pm];W[bc];B[bb];W[kb];B[lb];W[ha];B[hb];W[ia];B[jb]C[NM: Wrong. You must play G19 then F17.]
;W[ja];B[ga];W[fb];B[fc];W[gb];B[eb];W[ig]C[I'm not sure why W did not play F18, but I'm glad he didn't, because I was uncertain whether my upper left stones could be killed.

NM: I take it you mean F19. It is gote for W, and then you can take B17 - you are in no danger.]
;B[fa]C[This is not worth a move now. K12 is far bigger.];W[jh]
;B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[ji];B[ib];W[ka];B[la];W[jd];B[nb];W[ob]
;B[na];W[ra];B[ef]C[Here it seems I should have played something more severe to reduce the large territory W eventually took in this area, but where and how?

NM: Yes, you should have, though remember P16 is big. How about H12, or somewhere like G9 - difficult to cut it off from all its friends? But really you shouldn't have got into this situation.

Territory: B TL 8, TR 10, BL 8, B 12, R 10 - total 48, with limited further prospects. W R 21, TL 4, B 4, BR 15, T 4: total 48, but much better prospects for taking territory round E11 and N9. W is in the lead, unless you can do some powerful reducing or attack one of his groups (e.g. at O9?).]

;W[ep];B[dn];W[fg];B[fk];W[fj];B[hk];W[gj];B[hl]C[NM: Perfectly respectable reducing moves, but making no B territory, and W now has 33 points on L.]
;W[od]C[NM: Very big, but B should not reply. How about B H6?]

;B[jk]C[It often seems that I spend too much time reducing my opponent's territory and not enough building my own. But I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.

NM: sometimes you have to, but try to prevent your opponent from making a moyo. For example, by not playing F19.
