C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS, I'm EGF 4k and around 2-3d KGS level.

I'll start my comments with W.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]

(;B[nd]LB[jc:B][pd:A]C[W: As a principle, you should not attach to weak stones. Black is breaking this principle by attaching to White's weak stone. White's stone is called weak, because black already has two stones in this area to begin with, A being the stone in the corner, and B being the pincer. Touching only helps the stone being touched.]

(;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[lh]C[WildHayate: Fuseki's over. Were there any major mistakes during these first 26 moves? Not proper direction etc?

W: Usually fuseki means that all the four corners have been approached/defended and side extensions have been made. Bottom left is still unsettled. White has a better sense of the opening, developing in several areas, while most of Black's moves have only been focused on the right side of the board.]

WildHayate: I was going for a shoulder hit it ended in me doing hane. Does this work or is it a mistake from me?

;B[jf];W[kd]LB[mg:A]C[W: This on the other hand only helps Black. L14 is important so you don't get cut into two pieces at A, but this is a thank you move for Black, he's happy to be forced to play a move he'd play anyway.]

bokep [7k\]: i mistakeed


WildHayate: What is the best solution I could get here?

W: At this moment it is important to recognize key stones. The stones marked A and B do not matter in this game. Even if White saved them, they do not have any effect in the game since they do not cut anything. C is the important stone. It separates the Black groups from each other.]

WildHayate: Because of w mistake in the upper right I won the game. Any advices what should I improve in my games?

W: This was a fun fighting game, I enjoyed reviewing it. You played some unnecessary moves to capture dead stones, and you missed a couple of tesujis saving and capturing stones. You've probably heard this a couple of times already, but I recommend you to pick up a tesuji book or two and challenge yourself by not looking at the answer first. :-)]

(;W[bo];B[bl];W[co];B[am];W[mb]LB[ja:A]C[W: Black can not omit answering to this move, because it threatens a monkey jump at A, which is worth around 8 points.]

(;B[jk]LB[bg:A]C[W: The move at A is no longer sente, as Black can get two eyes even if White captures. Black should hurry and protect his weak stones in the center. Also, Black can not kill White's corner even if White does not play A.]

(;W[bg];B[ai];W[bl]C[W: This is the strongest attack against the Black stones. Black only has one eye, so White can aim at creating points on the bottom left side, and influence in the center while Black is fighting to get his another eye in the center..]

(;W[cb]LB[hc:A]C[W: This is an important move that mustn't be missed. White's top left corner is absolutely safe. This position occurs a lot in games. The invasion at A also works for White now, thanks to the descend to C18.]

(;B[lb];W[mb];B[lc];W[mc];B[mg];W[lg];B[lf]C[W: This way is better for Black. His top group is no longer in any danger, and White can not capture the cutting stone. Black gets points at the top and influence in the center, while White struggles to find another eye in the center.]
