C[B: Hi Decimoking, your fighting skills are good but there is a general mistake in your playing style: You are seeking life when you should move out. Seeking life for an enclosed groop is a desperate measure. An enclosed groop will not really take part in the whole board fight anymore. You are making moves which dont give influence and hardly give points, but your oponent gets more influence with every move. I'll point at three examples of this in your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[DecimoKing [2k?\]: higg
golearner1 [2k\]: hi];B[qp]C[Been trying out this fuseki for a while now]
;W[ed]C[This move surprised me];B[nq]C[Saw this exact sequence in another game so i decided to try it]
;W[kc];B[pj]TR[pd]C[Decided to play this to build my right and help my q16 stone]
;W[nc];B[cd]C[Felt like i could ignore white's approach

B: So far I am happy with your opening. You got a  good position.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[de]
(;B[bc]LB[bf:A][cf:B]C[B: This is a big mistake in direction. You do not want to get closed up in the corner. Correct is A or B. Not long ago B was the only answer but nowadays it seems A is gaining popularity as B depends on a ladder.
Example 1 of main mistake.];W[bf];B[db];W[eb];B[dc];W[ec]C[and i get shut in]
;B[ck]C[thought i needed to stop white's influence...maybe on the 4th line?
B: One can already see that your position will become a bit awkward if you have to extend upwards. But I dont really see a better point.
Maybe C8 is sligthly better as your position will not get so cramped.]
;W[cm]C[B: This is the only logical continuation for white as extending upwards has a big disadvantage for you.]
;B[ch]C[B: Now you are helping white to repair the cutting point at C14. And you get a cramped position. Not good. If your other black stone would be at C8 it would be better.]
;W[cg]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: hmmmm
JamieNoGo [-\]: C8 D12 would have been better for black
JamieNoGo [-\]: C9 is misplaced];B[eh]C[didn't want to be too overconcentrated]
;W[bh]C[Sieja [6k\]: Black probably wanted to get in a 2 space extension, but you're right.]
;B[ci];W[hq]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: ouch White
JamieNoGo [-\]: San San would be painful about now
B: Thats right, bad move by white.];B[qf]C[felt this was the biggest move
B: Looks good to me.];W[lq]C[Sieja [6k\]: Maybe he wants a 3-3 invasion, get influence, and then chase c11 ?]
;B[no];W[lo]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: cant chase C11
Sieja [6k\]: It has only an eye though.
Sieja [6k\]: As is];B[cq]C[take corner from white
B: good];W[dq]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: hmmm bad timing - now at least white has M5]
;B[cp]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: insta cash];W[cr]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: ohh....
JamieNoGo [-\]: D5 >>]
(;B[co]C[should have escaped to the outside
B: Yes D5 would be much better
example 2 of main mistake];W[do];B[cn]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: passive black]
;W[dm]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: B2 in gote seems necessary after this]
;B[dn];W[en];B[bm]C[B: This is turning bad. You are putting your C12-C9 stones under pressure all by yourself.]
;W[bl];B[br];W[bn];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[el]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: all Black did was damage himself =/
JamieNoGo [-\]: he shoulda D5'd and connected his 2 black groups
JamieNoGo [-\]: reducing white];B[ej];W[fg]
(;B[bk]C[B: This is a wasted move, no? You dont want to get two exes for your group, you want to get out!  And it isnt even giving you an eye!
example 3 of main mistake.];W[gi]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: G12 cut
JamieNoGo [-\]: this is totaly greedy by white];B[fk];W[nf]
C[Sieja [6k\]: G12 cut? g12 f12 f11 h11 ?
Sieja [6k\]: or ladder
JamieNoGo [-\]: forces black out and gives him shape
JamieNoGo [-\]: + free ladder rbeaker];B[mg]C[white's moyo was bigger than mine so reduce]
;W[oh]C[B: Thats to greedy from white. You punished him.];B[ng]
;W[og];B[of];W[ne];B[ni]C[i think black came off beter here
B: good];W[hk];B[cl];W[am];B[bi]C[trying to find life
B: If you need to find live in a position like this it is really painful. White gets valuable moves outside, and you do many moves which will give you only two points of territory at the end. Horrible result. Professionals sometimes say: If you are forced to live like this its better to die.
Plus: I dont think your groop is alive even now.]
(;W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[oe];B[pf];W[jh];B[ki];W[rp]C[this surprised me
B: its a standard move. White either gets the corner or the side.]
;B[rq]C[B: wrong side. The corner is small compared to your right side. Your right side should go in flames now.]

(;W[qq]C[B: ouch. strange move by white.];B[ro]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: interesting choice by white]
;W[pp];B[qo];W[rr];B[sp]C[B: now the whole exchange is good for you.]
;W[op];B[np];W[or];B[qr];W[nr];B[pq];W[oq]C[B: white is playing silly here.]

;B[fm];W[em];B[fl]TB[rp][qq][cr]C[trying to reduce white's territory]
;W[ok];B[ol]C[B: good fight starts here.];W[pk];B[nk]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: woah
JamieNoGo [-\]: black fights back :)];W[nl]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: first sign of kiai lol]
;B[mk];W[ll];B[oj];W[om];B[pl];W[pm];B[ql];W[qm];B[rl]C[B: well done]
;W[nn]C[this got confusing];B[mn];W[mo];B[on];W[ln];B[nn]C[Sieja [6k\]: lol
JamieNoGo [-\]: someone can't do 1 - 2 - 3 :)];W[hn];B[fr];W[fq]
C[JamieNoGo [-\]: no one cares about the top right :(];B[es]
;W[eq];B[pc];W[ob];B[dj]C[B: ok, game over now. If you need one more move to defend this groop you lost.]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[jk];B[kf];W[jg];B[mf];W[le];B[ea];W[fa];B[da]
;W[fb];B[hl];W[il]C[Sieja [6k\]: Close game, seems like a white win?]
;B[gr]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: this is not a close game =/];W[hr]C[dont even realize i've already lost]
;B[pb];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[me]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: depening on end game 10 point for white
JamieNoGo [-\]: ish
JamieNoGo [-\]: but that black group should not have lived]
;B[lj]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: it was 1 move away being dead for 30 moves]

JamieNoGo [-\]: oh god];W[mj]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: that was unbfortunate
complete endgame mistake]
(;B[qk]C[think i made a mistake on what was worth more];W[lh]
C[JamieNoGo [-\]: what?
Sieja [6k\]: lol];B[mi];W[li];B[ah];W[bg];B[nd];W[md]C[Sieja [6k\]: Well I was wrong. Not a close game after all]
;B[mh]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: even if the stones hadnt died];W[ag]
C[JamieNoGo [-\]: it was a 15 20 lead by white];B[ai]C[Sieja [6k\]: I like how this game shows an example of black having four corners and still losing]
;W[ao]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: he got most the end game
JamieNoGo [-\]: this is not a good example >>];B[ap]C[Sieja [6k\]: How? Black got four corners and lost.
Sieja [6k\]: Proving that proverb lol];W[ak];B[eg];W[ef];B[aj]
;W[al]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: 3 of the corners are hugely reduced]
;B[pq];W[ad];B[qq];W[dl]C[JamieNoGo [-\]: the proverb says you should resign if the apponent has 4 corners - to say that at such point he can simply play in the middle and live unconditionaly
JamieNoGo [-\]: where would your points be?];B[dk];W[lj];B[nj]
;W[gs]C[Sieja [6k\]: The point would be that black played so much in the corner, that the center is completely surrounded]
