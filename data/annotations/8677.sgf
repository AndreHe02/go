TKsansei: Hi!];W[dc]C[jerhum:

Hello,

I played black in this game.

Could you please review this game from the black prespective?

Although I have won this game, I felt all the time uncomfortable from the fuseki until the yose. I guess the reason for it is that I was psychologically behind.

Could you give me advises about the direction of play and how not to panic in front of stronger players (and eventually how not to let my groups be cut).

All remarks and advises are most welcome.

Thank you very much for your review.

Jerome


neil:

Hi,

I'm Neil, I play on various servers as neilh23, I'll try and answer your questions as best I can. I'm around 5k KGS. Any alternative lines of play I suggest are only suggestions - a stronger player would no doubt do things differently!

I enjoyed reviewing the game, handicap games are always difficult - black always feels timid about making complicated moves, and white will often overplay to compensate for the handicap; unless black punishes the overplays, he will ultimately fall behind.

Some general points:
* Avoid playing passive moves unless you have to. "The best form of defence is attack" - when you want to defend a group, play in a way that threatens your opponent with the side-effect of defending; it's very important to keep the initiative!
* Don't be too afraid of invasion while there's still open areas to be grabbed - a premature invasion will strengthen your stones, and make life difficult in the long-run for your opponent.
* Always be on the look-out to split your opponent's groups, and for ways your own groups could be split.]
;B[pp];W[dk]C[neil: this feels a bit awkward from white - it doesn't really threaten anything, nor do much with the D17 stone. Black should look to play towards splitting D17 and D9.]
(;B[jc]LB[ce:E][cf:C][cg:F][de:D][df:A][dg:B]C[jerhum: OK? What else?

neil: I think this is probably too timid, I'd aim at splitting white directly, A, B or C, D, E or F all look playable. If you want a move peaceful game, you can look at playing around F16 (see variation).]
;W[qj];B[qg]C[neil: Good.];W[qm]
(;B[jq]C[jerhum: shall I keep the pressure on R7 group instead with R4 or S4?

neil: I prefer this, it works well with D4 and Q4. R4 and S4 don't really threaten much (they would if R7 were at R6, for example). R5 might put a bit of pressure, but leaves the bottom open, so I wouldn't recommend it.

Right now, black's position is infinitely preferable to white's.]
(;W[ro]C[neil: Underplay from white]
(;B[rp]C[jerhum: was R3 better?

neil: Not sure, I think this is OK, since white damages his position with R3, black could have made life far more difficult for him! OTOH, black is ahead, and R3 helps cement his position.]
;W[qq]C[neil: White is being greedy];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or]
(;B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rq];B[sq];W[sr];B[sp]C[jerhum: should I have tenukied, here? I have built a nice wall with no real influence :-(

neil: You split white's groups in sente, so I say this move is good :-) As for no real influence, black P7 after would make this very powerful towards the center, and having a low stone T4 makes for all sorts of aji for an invasion later on.]
;W[rs]
(;B[ce]C[jerhum:OK? G17 or C6/ C7 or F4 better?

neil: As much as I like Black P7 (see variation), this direction is big, and splitting white is important. I'd maybe play this one at C14, since white can play C16 after this (see variation).

Attacking from the other directions is too easy on white, allowing his to link up D17 and D9]
(;W[gc];B[ch];W[dn];B[cp];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc]
(;B[be]C[neil: D15 is big for white, don't let him take it! (see variation)]
;W[de];B[df];W[ee]
(;B[bk]C[jerhum:B10 instead? or G3 and N17 are actually bigger?

neil: This is better than B10, I think.

G3 and N17 would be fairly passive moves. If you're playing towards protecting those invasion points, K15 and F4 are more active, however your B15 group is starting to look urgent (

Right now you should be scared of white boxing in your B15 group, so this is the right general idea. I like E14 here, it stops white playing there, and divides white's groups, but this seems good.]
;W[bj]C[neil: Overplay from white]
(;B[bi];W[bl];B[cj];W[ck];B[aj];W[bn]
(;B[mc]LB[fp:D][je:A][kf:B][om:C]C[neil: slow and passive. A (or even B), C or D all big points]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[jerhum: right direction, isn't it?

neil: yes! Although, imagine if black had K15 instead of N17 here ...]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[jerhum: mistake, I suppose. Should have played R14, shoudn't I?

neil: I had to look the joseki up here (not one I know), but it does actually work, R14 would have been fine though, and less complicated.]

;B[ne];W[me]C[jerhum: I don't like this at all but how to avoid being cut?

neil: I think you played the best path given the circumstances. I don't think you could've avoided this after the tenuki :-(]
;B[mb];W[na];B[oa];W[qb]
(;B[ri]C[neil: This is a thank-you move to white! All you do is remove some of his bad aji. P13 looks good to protect black]
;W[rj]
(;B[le]C[neil: wrong direction - White is threatening to squeeze the P16 group, so he's quite happy with this.]

(;B[rh]C[neil: Don't need to play this! Small, endgame move - black's Q14 group is in no danger]
;W[oj]C[neil: Big point for white,];B[kk];W[ih]
(;B[hb]C[neil: Another thank-you move, see comment to move 68. This area is actually pretty small - I don't think white can kill black's K17 group.]
;W[hf]C[jerhum: G18 was too small. I would like to connect the N10 group to the lower side/left corner group by putting pressure on either the D6 or the R7  group. How? Q5? F5? P6? E5? F6? I am kind of lost actually :-(

neil: In terms of putting pressure on white, white's centre still has potential cutting points at G15 and H13 (although H13 needs a ladder-breaker to work). Black's biggest area, however is to the right.]
(;B[gb]C[neil: slow, and strengthens white - this removes potential for cutting. See variation for one possible strategy]

LB[ac:E][fi:A][fp:B][iq:D][ql:F][rn:C]C[jerhum: I am lost again. Could you give a priority list of best/big/important moves here?

neil: Not an easy situation for black! A and B would be big moves for white, so they're big moves for black. Also be aware that your P4 group could be cut off right now by white playing at J3, and although I don't think you could live, white would use that reduce black at the bottom right.

As it is, black is very behind, so something desperate is in order - white's weaknesses are all in the top left, if you keep pushing at them, you could gain something ... Trying to connect to the centre group seems a good idea, although you need to be aware of the potential of white cutting off the P4 group.]

(;B[qn]C[neil: Black is already connected];W[ma];B[la];W[lb]
;B[ob]C[TKsansei has resigned the game.

jerhum: Can I kill the corner?

neil: white plays next, so if he plays T18, for example, he's unconditionally alive. Otherwise, I think black may be able to get ko, it's complicated though - try playing out a few variations yourself (W tenuki, B T18, W S18 is a good start).


Thank you very much for your review.
