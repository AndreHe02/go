C[In this game I play white, I will mark my comments #

I would ask that you
-Comment on my  biggest mistakes
-Comment on my  best move of the game  (so often we make good moves and don't realize why)

I will comment in any questions I have

Thank you in advance


--- Hi, I will marked my review with "--". Please see my summary at the end of the game.]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[oc];W[od];B[nd];W[pc]C[--- In normal joseki, white should play P15. 

This move is joseki if you start with 4-4 stone, instead of 3-4 stone.]
;B[oe];W[pd];B[nc];W[qf];B[of]LB[ic:A]C[--- This move is usually played around K17 for black.

Since black does not play there, you might consider playing J17 as the counter attack.

You in-game move is also OK.];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[gp]
;B[hq]
(;W[fr]C[--- This move is probably not good.

Black on both sides are not in danger even with this split.

The better move should be pushing black with H4 first. See variation.]
;B[jq];W[co]
(;B[bo]C[--- Black can play D4. See variation.];W[dp];B[bp]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[en]
(;W[do]C[--- This move is a bit submissive. You should put pressure at black stone. See variation.]
;B[fo];W[fp];B[bm];W[ck]C[--- THis is a bit loose. C8 is better.]
;B[bl];W[cl];B[fl]TR[en][fo]C[--- This black move is in the wrong direction. He moves close to white's wall. Later on, white may have a chance to play H6, etc. to attack this black group.

Black H6 or J6 would be better.];W[gc];B[ph]LB[pg:C][fj:A][qn:B]
TR[fl][en][fo]C[# I was not sure how to respond to this move, is s12 better?   What is correct?

-- Since your upper-left group is not in danger. You have an option not to respond to black.

Looking at the big picture. I would say playing around A creates some potential for white in the middle. It also aims to attack marked black group at the same time.

If you want to invade black's area, B looks to be a good point to start.

Trying to cut black at C should be done later if white is strong enough to have a support for the fight.]
;W[pg];B[oh]C[--- Black should play P13 instead of this move.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[qh];B[qi];W[pi];B[rh];W[qg];B[oi];W[pj];B[qj]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[oj];W[pk];B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[ro]

(;W[ok]C[--- Playing at O8 or O7 gets white out faster.];B[nk]
;W[nl];B[mk]LB[nf:A][nh:B]TR[pi][pj][ok][pk][qk][nl][ql][qm]
[qn]C[#Seems like an awful result?  Thoughts?

--- Playing at P9 was a mistake since it allows black O9 and N9, which fixed the weakness of cutting points at A and B.

You can see variation of white at O8.

To gain better positions, white should not try to push and cut at Q13 immediately but to play somewhere else instead.]
;W[ml];B[om]
(;W[ol]C[--- No need to connect yet. White should play P6 instead. You should always looking for a way to fight back forcing move.]
;B[oo];W[lk];B[mi];W[nh]C[--- This cut seems to be premature. You should have stronger white surrounding first.]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[li];W[lh];B[ki]LB[lh:A][ml:B]C[--- Now white groups are weak on both top and bottom.]
;W[rn];B[sn];W[sm];B[sl];W[qo];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[pq]TR[ml]
C[--- This cut is good. It separates black groups.

At least, it creates opportunity for the big white group to settle easier.]
;B[qr];W[pr]C[--- Unfortunately, white is captured. 

Playing at P3 instead and white has a good fight.];B[oq];W[rg]
;B[ri];W[or]TR[pq][pr]C[--- If you know that this white group will not survive, do not add any more moves to it.

white should start playing somewhere like N5 to settle the big group.]
;B[nq];W[mp]C[--- Too far. N5 is better.];B[mn];W[ln];B[mo]
;W[lo];B[lm];W[mm];B[km];W[no];B[nn];W[np];B[op];W[on];B[pn]
;W[nm];B[on];W[nr];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[ll]C[--- Now white loses one bottom group and could lose another one if black play at K5 later.

This was due to over-extend yourself in black's strong area.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[jj]LB[ik:A][jk:1][il:B]C[--- This is an odd move for black.

Normally, after white K9 attached the black stone, black should look to either hane (A) or extend (B).

If black wants to play from the L11 group, J11 looks better to me.]
;W[ik];B[hj]C[--- This black move seems a bit weak. It should be at G10 or H11 for better shapes.]
;W[il];B[im];W[hm];B[in];W[kl];B[jm];W[hn];B[ho];W[go];B[hl]
C[--- Another premature cutting. It would be very difficult to kill white.

Black should keep your group safe first at F10.];W[io];B[jo]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[gk];B[gn];W[hp];B[gm];W[ho];B[kp];W[fk]C[--- Good sequence for white. Huge loss for black.]
;B[fd]C[--- This black move forces white to make territory.]
;W[fc];B[ed];W[ec];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[gd];W[hd];B[he]
;W[id]TR[ed][fd][gd][ce][de][he]C[--- Now white has huge territory while clinging black group looks weak.]

C[--- Good cut.];B[mg];W[mf];B[lg];W[lf];B[kg];W[ne];B[ke];W[md]

[ir:D][cs:C]C[--- Now the end game has started. I would say that there are qite a few big points for both sides from A to D.

A) is the biggest one since white has weakness there.];W[fj]
C[--- Jumping in with white E11 is bigger.];B[fi];W[ij];B[kj]
;W[ii];B[hh];W[ih];B[ej]C[--- This black E10 is bigger than white J12.]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[dk]LB[pe:A][cj:B][ir:D][cs:C]C[--- Unnecessary move.

A to D would be bigger.];B[cj];W[gi];B[hi];W[gh];B[hg];W[ei]

;B[pb]C[#I didn't realize I had left this weakness, I'm guessing closing this would have been a win.

--- The game would be very close if you kill the O18 group. I agree that white would favor by a bit though.]
;W[qb];B[le];W[pe];B[me];W[pf];B[kf];W[pa];B[oa];W[ob]C[--- No need to fight this ko since it worth only about 5 points of territory.

You can play at R19 instead.];B[oe];W[of];B[pb];W[jh];B[kh]
;W[ob];B[er]C[--- This move is a much bigger move than winning the ko.]
;W[na];B[kd];W[ma]LB[ir:A]C[--- Small move. A is bigger.];B[ip]
;W[hr]C[--- J1 is bigger.];B[ir];W[gq];B[iq];W[hs];B[fs];W[ac]

;B[es];W[pm];B[af];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[--- In this game, you struggled quite a bit since move 46 onward. Losing two lower-right groups caused you to fall behind quite a bit.

Later on, you catched up with big territory on both top corners. Then, black played some good endgames to win.

It would be difficult to single out one move as the "biggest" mistake. Every game both players would make a lot of mistakes along the way. Probably, the move (#94) around lower left that you lose two groups and create one weak group is your biggest mistake.

Go is the game that who makes the least mistakes would likely win. So, it is also difficult to name the best move. Probably your biggest move is the cut at move #172 that allows you to capture the top area of the board.

Do not always follow your opponent moves. You should always look for sente for a bigger points elsewhere on the board.

You should study some basic endgame principles. Some of them are in the book "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go". 
- Look for double sente and sente endgame moves.
- Playing along the edge is usually bigger than in the center in endgame.

Most of all, play a lot of games and have fun!])
