C[Dear reviewer, any thougths about the game are welcome. Thank you in advance :-). I'll just have a few questions later.

J: Hello, I'm Juuso, your reviewer. I'll preface all of my comments with J:.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[de];W[ci]C[J: This is a very unusual pincer. It's not very severe, so black can ignore it if he wants to.]
;B[dp];W[pp]
(;B[qn]C[J: I think making a corner enclosure at P17 is bigger.]
;W[od];B[ld];W[qe];B[pd];W[pe];B[oe]C[J: This is the start of a difficult joseki.]
;W[oc]C[I don't know this move. It's not in joseki dictionary I use and don't know how to handle it. Q18?

J: I do not know this joseki very well, but...]
(;B[re]C[J: This move does not seem too bad. A complicated fight is unavoidable.]
;W[rd];B[rc]C[Can't white first extend to T16? Or would black respond with Q18?

J: Yes, black would most likely respond with Q18.];W[qc];B[sd]
;W[pc];B[rd];W[qg];B[rf]
(;W[qk]C[J: I don't think this is a good move. The top right is still the focus of the game.]

(;B[ne];W[pg];B[rb];W[lb]
(;B[kc]C[Is L18 better here?

J: L18 does seem better, yes.];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[ib]C[Is extending or jump to H17 instead of this better?

J: This is a bad move. The cut at J17 is not good for black. H17 instead would be better, yes.]
;W[ic];B[ec]
(;W[ce]C[J: A weird move. I don't really understand it.];B[hb]
;W[dd]
(;B[hd]C[I didn't like this move as it still leaves a lot of aji. But I couldn't find anything better.

J: This seems like the best move to capture.];W[qb];B[np]C[J: Seems like the right side.]
;W[rg];B[sf];W[oo];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[no]
(;B[rp]C[J: Extending at N4 is usual.];W[ro];B[rq]C[J: White could try N4 here, maybe.]

(;W[qo]
(;B[mq]C[Which shape is better here?

J: Extending at N4 would be better shape.];W[lo];B[cf];W[ee]
;B[df];W[ed]
(;B[cl]C[J: C16 is a crucial move for the shape of the black group.]

(;W[dl]C[J: Interesting move, but it does not seem very effective here.]
;B[ck];W[fq]C[J: The top left is still the focus of the game. Playing in the bottom left now seems strange.]
;B[dm];W[dj];B[dh]C[J: I would still prefer to take C16 first.]
;W[dr]C[J: Another weird tenuki.];B[fg]C[J: Suddenly it's white's group on the left that looks weak.]
;W[eo];B[cq]C[Now the game enters messy phase.

J: I think it's been pretty messy for a while now already. :)]
;W[fj]
(;B[hj]C[J: Black cannot attack like this, because it's too easy for white to connect to the bottom left.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[kq]C[J: A big move, but I'm not sure about the safety of the white group on the left. Black can probably chase the left side white group in a way that gets him access to the bottom side.]
;B[gn];W[gl];B[in]C[J: Like this, for example.];W[il];B[hq]
C[J: White does not look too happy.];W[fn];B[fm];W[hp];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[ip];W[hr]C[J: Connecting under like this is painful.]

(;B[iq]C[J: Black should just eat, though. This still gives white the F4 atari and whatnot.]
;W[ir];B[kn]C[J: Now white's L3 move looks misplaced. It has only gained a few points.]
;W[kl];B[mo]C[J: I don't get this move. It doesn't help black at all.]
;W[mn];B[lp]
(;W[cr]C[J: Why?]
(;B[ln]C[J: I don't like this, really.]
(;W[ko];B[kp];W[mp];B[jo];W[mo];B[lq];W[nk]C[J: In the end white managed to connect thanks to black's slack play.]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[kk];W[jk];B[ml];W[kj];B[mk];W[mj];B[lm];W[nj]
C[J: Now that white is strong in the center, black's group on the left is starting to look weak.]
;B[ek];W[el];B[cd]C[J: Black finally got this, it's huge.];W[cc]
;B[be]
(;W[fc]
(;B[eb]C[J: I guess black is trying to kill white. It does not look possible.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[fb];B[bc];W[bb];B[ab]
(;W[ca];B[db];W[ge];B[gd];W[fd];B[ff];W[fe];B[hf]C[J: White should have definitely not died here. Now the game is obviously over.]

;W[pm];B[pn]C[J: You four played a really difficult, fighting game! These tend to be decided by sheer reading power, so if you want to get better at games like this, you should do a lot of tsumego. :)

The fuseki of this game felt like it was more of a prelude for all the fighting. It felt like both sides wanted to just rush into the midgame as soon as possible. Fighting is fun, sure, but I think the fuseki is also very pleasurable. You could try playing more peaceful games as an experiment. :>]

(;B[lm]C[J: This separation here looks like more fun. White's right side is going to suffer.]

(;B[ho]C[J: Better shape and still sente.];W[ir]))
(;B[em]C[J: Separating white with this is crucial. Now black still has some attacking potential.]
))
(;W[be]C[J: I would just take this as white because black neglected to play C16. It also threatens to connect to C11, so it's a good move.]

(;B[cd]C[J: Black must take this.];W[cc];B[be];W[bd]C[J: Black's eyeshape is much better and white is not settled yet in the corner, either.]
