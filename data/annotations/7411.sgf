AB[dp][pd]C[Hi,

This is Kyle Blocher, 5-dan from USA.  Comments on the game are within the review.  I would say that next time you submit a game that you do more self-review and ask more questions about your own plays, as that will indicate what you have trouble with.

More accurate counting in the middle game will help you make better decisions.  Also, pay attention to exchanges and additional aji.]
;W[cd]C[Hello.
I am 1d IGS and this is the game I played with IGS 3 dan(I am black of course). I was convinced I was doing rather good, but somehow in the end I totally misread one sequence and got smashed. I wanted this game to be reviewed, because it involves a running battle  and I'm not good when it comes to those.If possible, I'd like to get some tips how to fight in such situations, and how to improve my Go, what I'm lacking.]
;B[ed];W[hd];B[ef]TR[hd]C[Playable in this situation, as the variations are simple and it is natural to split the marked stone since the top right is Black's.

However, the lower right is a star point, so allowing White to play C14/C12 is a little bit annoying.  You may also consider D14 or D13 since the ladder is good.]
;W[cf]
(;B[kd]C[[kb\]: Playable, but joseki is to jump out one more space.  You are free to exchange it because allowing Black to play at C12 after E12 is very bad for White.]
;W[hf];B[eh];W[ch];B[hh]C[Here is my first doubt - this move. There is a cut which my opp used, but I thought I'd try to make a wall chasing white a bit. Was it a little too optimistic?

[kb\]: This move is good.  You have many forcing moves against the left side to take care of your cutting points.]
;W[kf]C[[kb\]: This shape is pretty loose, though it seems cutting directly does not work, although I am a weak player :)]

(;B[jd]LB[jc:A][md:B]C[Maybe this move is at fault and I should leave it for later?

[kb\]: Slow and heavy.  Locally, A or B are better];W[ie]C[Heavy as well.  I don't like this move]
;B[me]C[[kb\]: Not the proper shape.  It's probably better to play on the left side now - difficult for White to invade at the top.  However, K16 implies you want to spend another move defending this area.]
;W[fe]C[Too early];B[ee];W[fg];B[eg];W[gi];B[di]C[[kb\]: Soft, perhaps necessary though.

This is K16's fault.];W[ci]
(;B[dj]C[[kb\]: Jump];W[fj]C[Isnt this move a bit soft on black, shouldnt it be on C9?

[kb\]: C9 is better, yes.];B[cj]C[[kb\]: Thick, super large, and secures Black's dragon.  Best move.]
;W[fq];B[dn]C[[kb\]: Honte.];W[jp]C[[kb\]: Slow - White should take the open corner]
;B[pq]C[Also, what would be the best move in this empty corner?

[kb\]: Your play is excellent.];W[po];B[mq]TR[jp]C[[kb\]: Now this stone is misplaced.  Q3 is where White should have played instead of K4.]
