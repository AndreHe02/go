C[hello reviewer!

please review for both sides though i can mostly only tell what i thought(white).

black wins with 1.5.];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[jj]C[black(my opponent) played tengen to make the game difficult
i thought its good to attack the corner first];W[pf]C[i thought it is best to attack on the fourth line to start to neutralize the tengen]
;B[nd];W[pj];B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[pq];B[jq];W[mo]
C[klin: W N5 usually no good.];B[lp]
(;W[lj]C[see variation

klin: W M10 too early.  It is a one-side territory.];B[cf];W[fd]
;B[dj]
(;W[ek]C[see variation

klin: W E9 no good.  Again, center is not big with the existance of B K10.  However, if playing at E8, B C8, W C3, it is acceptable.]
;B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[cq]C[klin: Now, comparing with W E8, B C8, W is worse off.]
;B[cp]C[klin: B should play at D3.];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq]
;W[fr];B[gq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn]C[klin: W got sente, can satisfy.]
;W[hj]SQ[ek][el]C[dont look very useful now

klin: H10 OK.];B[jh];W[hh]C[i am running without getting profit or useful strenght(what could i do better?)

klin: B center could make a huge territory if W does not do something.]
;B[if];W[eh];B[ch];W[ld];B[nf];W[oh];B[jc]C[klin: B can attack center first.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[mc];W[lc]C[klin: W M17 can play at N18 and make alive in the corner.]
;B[mb];W[jb];B[ic];W[md];B[pc]C[klin: B Q17 can M18 first.]
;W[lf];B[lg]C[klin: B M14 at N13 better.  W is in danger.];W[mg]
;B[mf];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[kf];W[jg];B[le];W[gc];B[ib]C[klin: B gained a lot of territory, but W strengthens in the center.]

(;W[jn]C[see variation

klin: This is an in-between move.  L6 is better.];B[ig];W[ih]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[jf];W[jh];B[li];W[mj];B[bd]
(;W[ef]C[see variation

klin: W E14 meaningless.  L10 cut is big.];B[cc];W[re];B[kn]
;W[ko]C[klin: L5 picked a fight that W cannot win.  If W had L10 cut, W could fight.  Now it is dangerous.]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[km];W[jo];B[jm];W[hn];B[im];W[go];B[ll]C[klin: This kind of move seems to be sente, but accomplish nothing but help the opponent.]
;W[mm];B[kj];W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[kr];W[iq];B[jr];W[hr]C[klin: H2 bad move. (see later comments)]
;B[gr];W[gs];B[hp];W[ip];B[ml];W[nl];B[nk];W[ok];B[hm];W[gm]
;B[gl]C[klin: If now B plays at H3 then J6,  W's liberty is so tight that it cannot do anything but being cut.]
;W[ep];B[in];W[gp]C[something went wrong for black

klin: W is lucky.];B[nj];W[ni];B[mk];W[oj];B[ec];W[dc];B[db]
;W[cd];B[bb];W[ed];B[fb]C[klin: B F18 slow.  It is time for E10.]
;W[rc]C[for white : s17 e 10 or somewhere else?

klin: Q2 is the largest place.  (If the center can be alive.) E10 is a safer move.]
;B[ej]
(;W[fj]C[see variation];B[fk];W[fl]C[klin: E9, E8 not big.  Saving them may get the big dragon killed.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[fm];W[em];B[gn];W[fn];B[gm];W[eo]C[something went wrong for white( i couldnt give up the three stones though upper white group in danger and probably without eyes)]
;B[gf];W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[dg];W[eg];B[ei];W[fi]C[i think black helped me to live earlier

klin: B E11 definitely a helping move.  However, W may not be easy to die.  W H14, F15 sente, D14 can make another eye.  So B has to D15 first, then J10.  It is complicated than you may think.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[ho];W[hq];B[ij];W[ii];B[hg];W[gh];B[pr]C[please give some comments on the endgame too

klin: Q2 huge move.  W play at Q2 is a sente.];W[qr];B[or];W[qs]
C[klin: W R2 dangerous.  S3 is the move.];B[op];W[oo];B[po]
;W[qo]C[klin: B should O7 then M7, or P8 then Q6.  Hard fight for W.]
