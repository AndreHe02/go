C[Two big errors I know of. Help me find more. Thanks!

I was white. Played on DGS, so no time restraint issues.];B[qd]
;W[dd]C[I wanted the chance to do a crossgame. With the editor I fight well enough and focused on denying big moyos.]

(;W[oc]C[My general conviction is tenuki during fuseki


This will only lead you to a slow defeat let us play a basic joseki and show you why this does not work for white.
at q15.

This being said the only option for white is to pincer the r5 stone.]

(;B[mq]C[This was bad for black he gives you a chance to make up for your lose I would take it.]

(;W[op]C[Keep them split. Ready to fight.

When you have a weak group you should worry about your own life not attacking.]

(;B[ip]C[This was okay, but he could do better.]
(;W[ql]C[So I attacked this one.

This is crazy it will end in a defeat making two weak groups.]
;B[rq]C[This move still works.]

He is just playing to win, because he can see right thru your plan.]

good choice.];B[qh]LB[qg:A][qj:B]C[I think this is odd between solid extension (A) and direct reduction (B).

This is a passive play and you should punihs him like this.]

(;W[cn]C[I'm satisfied with double wing. B will have no large moyos.
This is alright but leads to a hard fight.]

You are fighting with weak groups. Make them strong then attack.]

Well good game,You need to work on your habit of making weak groups. you may beat someone at a lower level, but dans will not fall for something so easily.]
