C[dN21death [2d\]: hi gl

Hi, I'm dN21death[2d\] on kgs and I would like this game reviewed for both sides since cksmao also wants to know about ti xD. I think I made a lot of stupid mistakes espicially considering the whole board. B took advantage of most of the mistakes but the bad outcome at the top left still kept me in the game. I lost on time but I think I was leading by a bit.

Thanks for the review.];B[qd];W[dd]C[cksmao [1d\]: hi];B[qq]
C[Donal: Black 3 seems strange because both black stones are on the third line on the right, making a position that is too low.]
;W[dq];B[do];W[cm];B[bo];W[fp]
(;B[ck]LB[bm:A][en:B][dl:C][hq:D]C[It's not clear what Black is trying to do here. There is a possibility that Black could later connect at A, but that is too low so Black needs to avoid doing that. And if he doesn't connect, he has two unconnected groups without eyes. The easiest play here is at B, making C and D miai. See the diagram for another way.

In any case, it's vital for Black to avoid letting his two stones get hemmed in.]
;W[dl]LB[en:A]C[White 10 is OK, but A is simpler.];B[cq]C[Attaching at black 11 doesn't make enough space for eyes, and so is probably not a good idea. This is just strengthening White.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[dp];W[eq];B[dk];W[ek];B[fo];W[go];B[en]
LB[fn:A]C[Black 19 is fine, but 21 should have been at A. Black will get locked in.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[fm];B[bm]C[Normally, if Black has to play a move like this to survive, we can expect him to lose the game.]
;W[em];B[cn];W[mq]C[I think i ended up well on the left but I'm not sure about this move.
What I did after as well I wasn't sure about.

Donal: It seems pretty good to me. It doesn't leave Black with a good extension in that direction, and it doesn't leave him an invasion either.]
;B[jo]LB[jq:A]C[If Black can get White to answer at A, this is a reasonable kikashi. But White can fight back.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[op];B[ro];W[jm]LB[jq:A]C[Capping play seemed most appropiate.

Donal: This works surprisingly well. My first reaction would have been to just answer at A since the white stones on the right are weak. But..]
;B[mo];W[om]C[The exchange of 35 for 36 seems to be good for White. So in retrospect, Black 29 was probably an overplay.]

(;B[lq]C[Black is going to get hemmed in again. This isn't good, and he needs to break this habit.]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[no];B[ln];W[mn];B[lo];W[mm];B[hp]
(;W[gp]LB[hr:A]C[Connecting at 46 is slack. This doesn't make good use of all the stones that White has played. Instead, he should play A. (see diagram.)]
;B[hq];W[lm]C[This was bad I think I tried to scare him into making life in gote somehow. =/

Donal: It's a nice thick move and tempting to play, but he can ignore it.]
;B[od]C[Black 49 is really big. If White had played there he would have had an easy game.]
;W[gr]C[No hurry to play 50 and 52. These can be used as ko threats]
;B[hr];W[mr];B[lr];W[mc];B[ob]LB[dj:A][cj:B][ne:C]C[Black 55 is too low. Next White can play at A, forcing Black B. Then he can play C, making a big center framework.]
;W[jc]C[Probably something higher would of been much better.]
;B[pi];W[qi]C[This seemed really stupid of me =/.

Donal: You need to find some way to build the center.];B[qh]

;W[rm];B[qp]C[Black 71 could be omitted. There are much bigger moves.]
;W[cf];B[qm];W[ql];B[fc]LB[eb:A][dc:B][ic:C]C[Black 75 is going to be attacked heavily. Black A is better. If white B, then black C for example.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[ff];B[hc]LB[id:A]C[Black 79 should be at A. Black is letting himself get locked in too easily. Several times he played moves that let White wall him in: at Black 21, 37, 41, 55 and 79.]
;W[ie];B[gf]C[This turned out really well for me.];W[ge];B[fe]
LB[ef:A][he:B][hf:C]C[White 84 should be at A. Then if Black plays B, then white C. This is a standard technique. Of course, the actual game was not bad.]

;W[lf];B[lj];W[ki];B[mf];W[mj]C[White 118 is good.];B[ni]LB[me:A]
C[But since Black played at 119, White should play next at A. This makes a big difference.]
;W[mk];B[le];W[kf];B[md];W[sg]LB[lc:A][sh:B]C[White 124 should just be at A. 124 isn't as good as it looks because Black can throw in at B. (Explained in more detail later)]
;B[rf];W[nb]C[Mistake xD.];B[nc];W[eb];B[lc];W[kb];B[lb];W[sf]

(;B[se]C[White 32 is no good. (See diagram.)

Donal: White played a good game, basically. White 48 was too slow, and gave Black a chance to recover. White 58 was in the wrong direction, as White should have been trying to build the center.

Throughout the game, Black was playing too low. Several times he got locked in unnecessarily. Black needs to give higher priority to maintaining a path to the center.

Still, attaching at 1 makes White strong, so you have to decide whether it's worth it.]
;W[cg];B[dl];W[nq];B[pn];W[nc];B[pc];W[kc]C[White can still sacrifice his stone though, and get a decent game.]
