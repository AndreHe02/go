;B[dd]C[Hello, dear reviewer

in this game I played as white and lost the game by blundering towards the end of the endgame, however without that blunder the game would have been awfully close and in any case decided by endgame, even after black's blunders in the game seemed more significant than mine. That surprised me, as my opponent played a lot of crazy moves that I should have been able to punish and profit, nevertheless the result turned out well for black. I would like to ask what way to punish black would have been more effective and also maybe about the most severe mistakes in the endgame.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game. I'm very much looking forward to your advice.


> Hi, Daniel Zrno here.
I've ran through the game quickly at first, and am now going to go slower and comment.
My first impression is that you had a very aggressive opponent, but also that you try to 'punish' him a bit too much.
I have a habit of playing a very relaxed style, being aggressive only when I have to (and this kind of opponent is one of the cases where you have to), so I hope my review will be of some use to you :)]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dp]C[Maybe I should start playing diagonal 4-4 to avoid a cross-game, just because I'm a lot less familiar with it. On the other hand it favours me in theory due to komi (yes, I know that's completely irrelevant) and maybe gives me a chance to try something new.

DZ: I think of it this way - if I play diagonal, I've removed a choice from my opponent. That's good.
Of course, that's "tournament" mindset. When trying to learn, don't worry and just try everything out ;)]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]C[
DZ: Since you ask at the end of the combination, you don't have to play C3 here.
Personally, I find it a bit submissive, and the resulting formation cramped, for this early in the game.
That said, pros do play it so I can't say it's bad. It gives you stability.

I just point some alternatives, but it really depends on the context and what kind of game you like...]

(;W[cq];B[ck]C[not sure what other options there may have been.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[I really don't get why people play this... although I messed up the followup of that really badly.


DZ: I agree, I also think it is not such a good move by itself. It is generally used when black wants to attack the white stone, but in this case it is not really possible as there is only white presence further up the side.

Still, you should not worry about your opponent making a bad move. Just go with it and use it later (in this case, the corner will still be open to invasion unless black wastes an extra move!)]
;W[pn];B[np];W[qj]C[maybe high is better?


DZ: I think this is fine, you get the high-low balance (if all is high it's easier to invade later).]
;B[nd]C[one more move I don't get. It's not a mistake (in any case at this level) but wouldn't a simple low approach be better?


DZ: I agree with you :)];W[pf]
(;B[qc]C[this is an overplay, but I'm not sure how to punish it. I decide that letting black live in the corner and taking the top side while severely attacking the o16 stone is a good plan. Not sure if there's better.


DZ: It is strange in any case. O16 doesn't help this as much as O17 would have, and if he really wanted the corner then simply taking it immediately might have been better.
Maybe there is some sense, but I really don't see something like this often, nor do I see why he would approach high and then invade in a position like this.

Your decision is good I think, just no need to stress "attacking O16 severely" yet. It is only one stone and there are other urgent points on the board (M3, or approach D16).]
;W[pc];B[pb]
(;W[ob];B[qb];W[nc]C[not sure about this move, it seems to put the most pressure on o16 though, so I thought it was better than a solid connection.

DZ: Even though it looks a bit weird, it's ok I guess. Maybe I don't like that it potentially gives him P16 as sente later.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[sd]C[black is alive.];W[jd]LB[qq:G]
[lq:D][nf:E][cf:C][le:F][jd:A][fc:B]C[this is the move I choose to play to pressure o16 and at the same time take a really big point, since that area is developable for both. Is an approach on the top left corner better though? How about something like m3? Something more severe against o16, maybe building the right side instead? I put in some letters to illustrate my candidate moves. Which of these are good, which are really bad with wrong ideas behind them? Out of all those I still prefer my move. I chose this point in the game to do this because I thought it was a turning point and chance to gain a significant lead.


DZ:
The result of the corner was that you enclosed B completely taking both sides AND got sente. That is a huge victory for you in my eyes (I think on pro level B could pack his bags now ;))

As for the moves, personally...

A: looks ok in the sense of using the wall, but maybe a bit too close to your influence. You can be bolder.

B: I would rather go with B than A.
If he backs off (wiser), you can then play A and have a nice top side.
If he decides to pincer you, you can welcome a fight because of your strong wall on the other side.

C: I don't like it, looks cramped and kind of pushes him into undermining your strength on the other side (either by backing off or attacking your C in some way).

D: I feel this is urgent, but the top may be more urgent :)

E and F are way too close to your influence. Much too small (imagine him responding a bit left of "A" to your E/F)

G: no need, you can always play this move. If he protects it in any way, he just used 4 stones to take ~18 points and you can be happy. It is too early for either of you to worry about this.]
;B[md]C[mistake by black, in my opinion. Allowing me to severely attack by making his light one stone into a heavy running group should allow me to profit a lot.

DZ: agreed];W[mc]C[maybe not severe enaugh. This move aims at profiting more than attacking, in that it tries to build territory on the top. At no point in the game did I consider the possibility of killing the group under attack.


DZ: It's perfectly good in my eyes. You're making profit while he is making his group heavier. Plus, you're about to climb to the 4th line, and he really shouldn't be pushing that.]
;B[mf]C[black uses the space I gave him to run, however I still think this is bad, since I can profit both on the top and the right by attacking. Black should try to reduce me on a big scale and consider sacrificing the two stones if that makes overconcentrated.

DZ: I agree with you again. This is not the time for him to activate these stones.]
;W[kf]C[not sure if this move is good. It's aim is to push black downwards rather than towards the left, since I can get threatening moves there which help me build the right side.

DZ: I can't call it bad, but it does look a bit strange to me.
I think the direction is ok, because pushing from below would leave him the possibility of exploting the aji around L16-K17 a bit too much (I can't read out everything that can happen there, but it does look like it could help him either take the top side nicely, or secure this group with relative ease)

This move helps with that aji, and will force him to force you to secure the right side, which is ok.

That said, if R10 was high (Q10), I would actually consider pushing from the bottom :)]
;B[mh]C[DZ: I would consider something like this here...]
(;W[oh]C[building the right side and still attacking];B[pl]
C[black sees my plan and decided to start reducing my potential right now. I think this move is not bad by black and don't really know how to react. Possible ideas are:
-keep attacking the first black group, which I dismissed as N10 is too thin and L12 doesn't seem like it will be a usefull stone in the future, o11 with the intent of separating the two weak black groups and attacking both seemed extremely risky, since it would put my Q6 group in danger.

I was deciding between R8 which is submissive and to some extent gives up the prospect of a severe attack on black and moves like o6 strengthening my Q6 group while thretening to attack black. I didn't play o6 because I thought black would play something like K3 and I didn't see a good way to attack the black stone, it seems light and the first weak black group seems to have enaugh space to run.

I played R8, which is probably a mistake, as I was thinking in the game too, but couldn't see a better alternative.


DZ: Yeah, this is relatively hard to deal with (or more - risky - cause one of you could lose heavily.. which is good for him in this case to turn the game violent, as any calm play would make you win on points).

I am also worried about Q6 and think R8 too submissive.
Considering that your other group (Q14) is perfectly safe, I am tempted with the following ideas...]

(;W[ql];B[pi]C[don't know if this move is good. I was expecting black to play something like k3 or h3 anyway. This move claims that my shape is very bad, however after the extremely slow move of R8 I'm not too worried. My aim is to split and resume the attack or kill the Q8 stone on a large scale and make territory there (which is a bad plan since I'm trying to make territory that's very easily reduced).


DZ:
I think it's more of a "let's complicate things and hope for the best" kind of move.
I would keep calm (esp. after R8) and keep him split. If he wishes to create two heavy groups, that's fine.]

(;W[pj];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni]C[DZ: I don't like that you're letting him connect so easily, while poking at your territory and even allowing for the possibility that he splits your groups sometime later.

Q8 is light, and now he basically has only one weak group to worry about, where it could've easily been two (or at least two stones wasted)]
;W[nn]C[probably bad timing, attacking the weak black group should be prioritized. Maybe M10 or N9 are viable options? This move only tries to kill off Q8 which is a rather sad result, at the same time still encouraging black to play an extension on the bottom, maybe even weakening my bottom left corner.

DZ: I would even let things as they are now, and go back to F17 or M3.
When something is weak, it is a source of worry for your opponent. You are in no rush to settle the situation. Instead, use it when it's a severe timing.
If you play elsewhere, and he decides to add yet another (no-points) move to secure his group, you can be happy.]
;B[qi]C[no idea what black is trying to do. Make eyes maybe? I would love him to do that.

DZ: I think he just wants to have R8 group weak, but this feels way too slow. It is worth some points, but I think not as much as e.g. F17.

Point of R8 being weak is that you can't safely snatch the corner from him.]
;W[lq]C[now I'm worried about black playing on the bottom. Not sure if this is the correct move to start. I was trying to get territory on the bottom AND some of the corner at the same time, which would really punish black's choice of joseki in that corner. However something went horribly wrong here.


DZ: don't try to take everything ;)
This is fine.];B[mq]C[didn't expect this move. Was thinking black would play P2 or O2 to defend his corner for good. This does seem better, however I don't know how it affects the 3-3 invasion.
 It seems to strengthen the corner while giving me potential to really enlarge my corner. I wasn't sure how to respond so I played the standard move.


DZ: Yeah, I would do the same. This still doesn't clear the corner aji for him, and it does make your side much more solid.]
;W[lp];B[bq]C[strange timing I assumed this move was aiming at invading my bottom potential while thretening to attack my corner group. However if I could find a move to solidify that area, the exchange would be bad for black. Not sure which move is the correct way to fix.

DZ: Might as well go for his corner now.
I think there's a lot of dangerous aji there.]
(;W[ip]C[I play closer to the right because it seems that side is more in need of being strengthened, even though it's overconcentrated in principle. I play high to get more influence in the centre, as I still aim at attacking black, while looking forward to solidifying 4th line territory after black manages to escape my attack.


DZ: It's not bad, but it does feel a bit timid.
I would rather go with the D8-D6 combination.];B[hq]C[black will not let me have territory anywhere this game. I have no idea how to react to this. the move itself seems really wrong though. I decide to take the outside and decide if I can kill black later, as it's impossible for me to read the life and death of it from here. Letting black run out didn't seem good to me.


DZ: This is clearly an overplay, and one that should be punished.
In my amateur opinion, if you let him run now, you might as well resign. I normally play calmly, but this situation calls for blood :)

Seems like B has forgotten he still has a weak group in the center...]
;W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr]C[I wonder how much of this black planed. Is this alive for black? Is there an important thing one can know like "invading a large 3-4th line keima in that way guarantees life"?  How valuable is my wall if I play softly?

DZ: To answer in reverse...
Your wall normally would be valuable, esp. with his weak group on the board. However, if you let him wipe all your territories like this, I'm afraid you'd put yourself in the position that you actually have to kill that group, and that is not a nice place to be in.

Invading a 3-4 line ogeima might generally be alive, yes (or able to run away), but I think in this case W is too strong around it and can afford to play some crazy moves. Not to mention, that bottom right corner is still not looking too healthy.

Is this alive for black? I would say no.]
(;W[er]C[I play double hane, since I felt that the other variation was not good enaugh. However I think both me and my opponent misread black's standard response, which is good for black.

DZ: Yeah, this gives him too much!];B[eq];W[fp]
(;B[gr]C[I think this is a mistake for black.

DZ: Agreed.];W[dr];B[jr]C[is this alive? these "loose" life and death problems are so hard...]

(;W[iq];B[ir]
(;W[hs]C[bad move by me. Black can't make two eyes by playing there. I should prioritize breaking the connecion to black's corner.

DZ: Yes he can, by playing exactly there. Am I missing something?
But you're right in the sense that if he connects this stone becomes useless.

There's not much you can do here except break connection to the corner in a way that allows you maximum aji when you attack it. This B group has to live in gote anyway, and then you attack the corner (and possibly kill it, I'm not strong enough to read out all variations there).]
;B[lr]C[and here is another position that I couln't figure out. I think black's move punishes my mistake correctly. However there should be a lot of trouble in his corner now. Something went terribly wrong there for me.

DZ: The corner is a mess to read out for me, but I think as is - it lives (but you can steal quite some points).]
;W[mr]C["cut the side you don't want". Black can't atari me and I thought this was good to get more aji in the corner.]

(;B[kr];W[qq]C[Is this the right move? The best result I can hope for is make a living group in the corner while depriving black of two eyes there. Is that possible?

DZ: Either this or P3, but this is how I'd start too.
I don't think you can deprive him of two eyes though, not anymore.]
;B[pq]C[I was slightly surprised by this move, simply because it isn't "maximum greed mode". Black feels the danger. The standard move S5 seems like it's not asking for enaugh here, but I couldn't figure out a better way.


DZ: This is pretty much the only good response I think.
For what to do next besides S5...]
(;W[ro]
(;B[qp]C[I've actually never seen this move, I think. Probably because it doesn't work and I completely let my opponent get away with it.

DZ: No, it's actually pretty standard (along with S4 if B really needs eyes)]
;W[rp];B[rq]
(;W[qr]C[I thought this should work for white, just because it would be the standard response in that position if it worked for black.

DZ: this is a mistake.
You can leave the position as is and trigger something else later - see alternative.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[or];W[nq]C[It looks like black got away with it. I try to do something with my left over aji from the failure of dealing with black's invasion. Maybe I missed something good here, but I don't see anything that works. Best possible result seems kindo' sealing black in.

DZ: Yep...];B[mp]
(;W[oq]C[DZ: This is a gift for him...];B[nr];W[mo]
(;B[op]C[black didn't have to respond... it's such a desaster for white, makes that kick joseki look like a miracle...

DZ: Sadly, yes.]
(;W[nj]C[I go back to attacking, hoping to get some thickness against the black left side later and build territory in the centre... always a good way to lose.


DZ: This is again way too tight.
If you want to attack (and possibly kill), cast a wider net (see alternatives)]
;B[mi]C[not sure what black is doing. Maybe setting up some kind of net on P12... even so, I don't really care about that stone or him getting one eye while I seal him in.

DZ: I don't get this either...]
(;W[mj]C[looked like the best shape to me. Not sure how much trying to come one the K or L lines and blocking black's path would give me. I chose to guide him along and take less risks.


DZ: Too close!!];B[qg]C[Think I have to connect...];W[qf];B[gc]
C[black decides that he's fine and I don't get territory on the top... that seems like an overplay to me, but I don't think I punished correctly.

DZ: He risks too much, considering that he is in the lead.
However, if he gets away with it, he won.]
(;W[ki]C[this seemed like the most severe move to attack. Maybe I should play a bit further away from black? Looking at this now it seems black is in really huge trouble. He didn't panick for a single move though.

DZ: Agreed, wider net.
Still, I think he can live.];B[li]C[really ugly looking move. Not sure if that's any good, in any case it's confident.]

(;W[lj]C[probably this is a mistake, justifying his move. L12 seems better and my move is too submissive, just worried about 4-6 points of territory where I didn't want any 10 moves ago.


DZ: yeah..];B[kh]LB[ji:D][jh:C][ih:E][lg:A][kg:B][ig:F]C[black runs. I believe black has half an eye right now. This is another crucial moment in the game, I think. I played the peep because black has to connect and it gives him bad shape, while the peeping stone slightly strengthens my stones in the area, however it gives black the chance to atari first. Maybe I should have played a different move here, there are a lot of options and they're all complicated.

DZ: indeed, it's hard to seal him in and kill too.
The most severe option is C...]
(;W[lg]
(;B[mg]C[I was utterly taken aback by this move. It still doesn't give black more than half an eye. This is my chance to cut and try to kill him, but I back away and force him to keep running. Reading out if I can kill it seemed too futile a futile task to even try. Now I think cutting is correct. I'm too obsessed with getting that centre which is still easy to reduce.

DZ: If you cut, be careful! Cutting looks very ugly and gives you plenty of bad aji... (see variations for B after cut)]

(;W[ji];B[lh]
(;W[jh]C[here I was still not sure if black can actually escape though...

DZ: Again too close...];B[kg]
(;W[lf]C[maybe I should consider giving black that stone? It comes down to reading the eye shape inside...
I'm too obsessed with making him run and profiting, when your opponent makes you kill, you gotta kill.

DZ: Yes, letting him out now looks contrary to previous moves...]
;B[jg];W[ld]C[another move that reaks of fear. Securing my 8 points on top and ensuring that I don't have to think about life there anymore.

DZ: I think it's ok. More than 8 points and removes plenty of bad aji.
Also, it's pretty much sente.];B[jf];W[dl]C[here I decide that black has succeeded in running away and it's time to take my sad centre territory.

DZ: good :)];B[cl]C[this might be too submissive by black.]

DZ: YES!
This is way too small...];B[hk]C[now we have this on our hands. Not sure if it's too deep or not, also not sure what the best way to attack is. In any case playing a move towards my walls would be too submissive and justifying his move.

(;B[rc]C[DZ: Actually, I think B just killed himself.
We'll get to that in the endgame.

See alternative for how this corner usually plays out (there's not much room for experimentation I think).]
;W[gd]C[and I decide to take this move and expand my top territory while reducing black's potential from the other side. The cut at J12 is a big pain in the butt though... In any case my calculation told me it's impossible to keep attacking black in any meaningfull way, let alone kill.

DZ: probably you're right, though giving him a stone like this looks painful.]
;B[ff];W[fc];B[fd];W[ed]C[this move is bad. It's gote since I have to connect. Not sure whats better. Some combination of not loosing the top and reducing black's corner is called for.

(;B[fe]
(;W[ec];B[ee];W[dc];B[cd];W[ii]C[I decide that I HAVE to connect those stones... underestimated how much sente moves black gets in the corner, but even so I feel like this connection is mandatory.

Thank you for reviewing this game. I hope you find my comments helpfull as to what I want to know about this game. Of course I'm also happy about any advice concerning points I completely missed too. If I had not blundered in this way, I might have won by about 3 points. Considering that I was attacking the whole game that seems like areally sad result. Please tell me where I went wrong. The tactical lines on the bottom are also still a big questionmark to me.

DZ:
No worries, it was an interesting game to review :)
Were it not for the byo-yomi mistake in the end, you would've won.
And a 3-4 point win is still a win, and I would say there is nothing sad about it ;)

Attacking is fun, but doesn't necessarily mean victory (e.g. look at Lee Chang Ho in his youger days - he would let the opponents take what they want but still win a vast majority of the time... or Shukaku Takagawa, with his style known as "lukewarm water" , who had no problem playing submissively if he thought it will keep him ahead - his strength was recognizing exactly when he was in the lead and then just focusing on keeping it without risk).

Ironically to my advice (and playstyle) though, Lee Chang Ho was later defeated more and more by ultra-aggressive opponents who just caused fights all over the board.

I think your opponent was one of those aggressive players who just doesn't seem to want you to have anything. It is daunting and hard to deal with such styles, but ultimately - they are just as risky for the one who plays so as for his opponent.
It just makes for a high-stakes game (something useful to create if you're playing against a stronger opponent - chaos benefits the weaker one more).

In such situations, try to remain calm and keep opponents groups separated. Due to such a style, the game will likely come to a point where something must die (possibly to both players), and then the most important skill (apart from reading L&D) is calculating how much is what worth.

Even in this game, you had a clear chance to kill his bottom invasion and the game would be over there and then.
That invasion survived but opened the weakness at his R3 corner, and I think you could've wrestled the corner from him after that.

His invading groups also gave you sente for big points several times (something invading groups tend to do), but you didn't use it as much as you should've (e.g. to approach D16 before it got reinforced).

Even without that, and ignoring the top-right corner which could've died due to opponent's mistake, you still lost a lot of points in some places (most notably top left corner and center), and STILL had a winning position.
That would imply your opening and mid-game style was definitely better, and the game only became close in the endgame due to many small accumulated mistakes.


I would say your biggest mistake was trying to punish those groups immediately and then losing sente for no gain.
If you keep them in their "half-alive" state longer, you can always wait until there are several of them on the board and they can be attacked profitably.
If you can't see a way to attack them profitably, don't attack them. Take points instead and wait for your chance - it will come.
Each of those groups is a debt that the opponent will have to pay eventually (and each of those groups gives him no points!)

Cheers!
