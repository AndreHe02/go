;B[ho];W[fm];B[hn];W[gm];B[nq]LB[cg:A][hm:B][il:C]C[** I would prefer the playing on the left side as it seems larger
in scale than the bottom. b) or c) are also big points.];W[np]
C[** An attractive move since it makes black rather overconcentrated,
but white mustn't end in gote here.];B[mp];W[oq];B[no];W[op]
;B[mq];W[qm]LB[qp:A]C[** This is not honte. Although the white formation looks
quite solid, black lives very easily after a).];B[cg]C[** Black got to play both on the left and at the bottom.]
;W[cj]LB[ci:A][cr:B][ds:C]C[** I can't see any compelling reason not to go all the
way with a). There is a little bad aji in the corner though,
particularly if white is planning to answer b) by c).];B[qj]
LB[jd:A]C[** a) is also big];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pc];B[qc]
;W[qb]LB[qd:A]C[** After a), white gets settled too easily here. (See variation.)]

(;B[qd];W[ob];B[id]LB[ec:A][rb:B]C[** This just invites a corner invasion. Probably black
has to play a), and then fight back when white invades.
b) would also be natural, aiming to keep white from
being completely settled.];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc]CR[id]C[** J16 is in the wrong place now.]
;W[mo]LB[nn:A]C[** Unreasonable. Black will be quite ok if he just comes
out at a).];B[pn]C[** Too fancy.];W[lo];B[qn]C[** Tough!];W[kq]
;B[kr];W[kp];B[jr];W[nn];B[oo]C[** This seems a bit hairy, black must be sure that he
knows what he's doing. The simple way would be to
play q7. (See variation.)]
(;W[on];B[po];W[pm];B[rn];W[rm]LB[mr:A]C[** a) might just have saved white.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[or];W[pq];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[mm]C[** Now black shouldn't lose this game.]
;B[oj];W[kc];B[jc]C[** Fine. Black doesn't have to try very hard now.]
;W[kb];B[kd];W[lb];B[jb];W[ld]C[** Small.];B[ej]LB[di:A][ei:B]
[dk:C]C[** Could also play a), b), or c).];W[di];B[fh]LB[ei:A]
[gj:B][el:C]C[** The problem is how to deal with the white push
and cut. It seems rather generous just to give up
E10. So I would prefer a), b) or c) here.];W[eg]C[** No good.]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[dg]C[** This just strengthened black.];W[ei]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[gk];W[ek];B[hm]LB[le:A][kf:B]C[** Or a) followed by c). Black can be quite happy with
this development.];W[pi];B[qi];W[pg];B[qg];W[qh];B[rh];W[ph]
;B[rf];W[pj];B[bf]LB[aj:A][be:B][bd:C][bg:D][ab:E][da:F]C[** There are various forcing moves against the corner, so
probably it is better to hold back on this. One could start
with a), for example. Alternatively, after b) to e), f) will also
be sente.];W[be];B[aj];W[bj]LB[ak:A]C[** Sould have been a).]

[jo:C]CR[kq][kp]C[** Because of a), black is a lot weaker here than he
looks. The idea should be to try to take advantage
of white's weakness at b). In actual fact, if black plays
c), he either rescues L7 or captures the two marked
stones.];B[jn];W[hl];B[hh];W[in];B[jo]C[** This is no good.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[jp];B[hp];W[sn];B[qs]LB[ro:A];W[kg];B[kf]C[** This is rather careless, look at the size of black's
territory here. In the game it becomes 7 (!) points.];W[ke]
;B[jd];W[jf];B[lf]LB[if:A][le:B]C[** This should be a) to defend the territory, or b) to
get compensation.];W[le];B[je];W[if];B[mf];W[ih];B[hi];W[hg]

here he would have had a winning game in spite of

the bottom first.];B[lr]LB[nr:A][or:B]C[** (Black could also play a), but then white gets b) in sente.)]

Q5.];B[rn];W[rm]LB[qp:A]C[** Now a) doesn't work so well.];B[on]

(;B[oc]C[** Instead ...];W[pb];B[od];W[ob];B[nd]LB[mc:A]C[** ... black goes for the outside. a) would just give black
more thickness, so ...];W[qd]C[** ... white takes the corner.]
;B[qe];W[rc];B[dc]LB[rd:A][nb:B][mc:C]C[** I think tenuki is probably ok here, although a
reinforcing move would not be bad either. If
we compare to the variation where white plays
san-san after M17,  black here has either better
thickness or sente.]))
