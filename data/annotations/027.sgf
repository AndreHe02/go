KM[0.500000];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[pj]L[po]C[Rob-This is clearly a mistake on w's part. When b has two 3-4 opening points, w must approach one of them.. Seems q5 (a) would be superior here..]
;B[qo];W[jq];B[qh];W[cf]M[pj]C[Rob- Since w behind, seems he leaves the marked stone too weak.]
;B[jd]C[ max 5k*: d15 or k17 would have been better than r12 right now


Rob- I'm not sure I agree, but d15 would have been more certainly sente.. I like k16, It threatens some major moyo building..]
;W[eq]C[ max 5k*: k16 a must
 max 5k*: moyo reduction necessary
 max 5k*: c9 maybe

Rob- Again, w trying to catch up..];B[ck]C[Rob- This seems like a strong move.]
;W[cm];B[ch];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh]C[Rob- This seems to help b..];B[og];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[jn];B[ql]L[nh]C[Rob- I feel that o12 (a) might be better for b. But this move puts pressure on w, and will end up building some territory for b..]
;W[nh];B[mg]C[Rob- A good move for b.];W[hc]L[mq][nq]M[nh][oh][ph]
[qi][pj]C[Rob- An abysmally slow move by w. If no move to reinforce the marked stones,then n3 (a) or o3(b) are clearly superior.]
;B[nl];W[jf]C[Rob- Another horrible move for w. Now w has 2 weak groups.]
;B[ie]C[Rob- keep w split, a good move..];W[jh];B[mh];W[nj]L[mi]C[Rob- This should almost certainly be n11 (a).]
;B[mi];W[bj]C[Rob- Clearly an overplay by w. The right side group is very weak..]
;B[cj]C[Rob- Now w realizes that b9 (a) leads b right into his moyo..Oops, too late.]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[bl];B[bk];W[ak];B[ci];W[aj]C[Rob- b is now very thick, and w's upper left corner is very thin..]
;B[bf];W[be];B[ce]C[Rob- wow, a really nice move by b..];W[de];B[cd];W[bg]
;B[df];W[cg];B[dg];W[af];B[ah];W[bd]L[ag][cc][dd]C[Rob- Here, w is in desperate straights. If b does b13(a)  atari, then c17 (b), it seems that at best w's stones live small in the corner,  and b pushes through at d16 (c), and w does not have a game left..]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[ei]L[dh]C[Rob- Realize that d12 (a) is not a cut point. It's a net. w has some chance in the game now, though b is well ahead.]
;W[cc];B[ee];W[dd];B[fe]L[lk][jj]C[Rob- I feel this move could have been more aggressive. W has 2 very weak groups, and a move to attack and further split those groups is sure to yield profit. I'd suggest m9 (a), though the cap at k10 (b) seems very strong, given your huge thickness.]
;W[jj];B[dm];W[dn];B[lq]C[Rob- A huge move. I feel like it could be more aggressive, but this move puts b even further ahead..]
;W[lp]C[Rob- A poor move by w..It helps b to turn the bottom right into territory. The only thing this sequence does is to give w a little bit of thickness to work with.]
;B[mp];W[kp];B[hk];W[kd]C[Rob- w clearly in bad shape. This move simply attempts to complicate the game.]
;B[md]L[kc][ke]C[Rob- This move seems a bit passive. l17 (a) or l15 (b) seem the right thing here..]
;W[je];B[id]C[Rob- Very good.];W[ld]L[lf]C[Rob- m16 is awful shape. w must clearly m14 (a). An obvious move to everyone but w..]
;B[lf]C[Rob- The obvious key point. Good move.];W[le];B[lk]L[kf]C[Rob- m9 is a key point in keeping w separate. l14 (a) is a scary point for w if b goes there..]
;W[qk]C[Rob- w scrabbles for eye-space..];B[rk];W[pl];B[qm];W[ol]C[Rob- w seems fond of this lousy shape, like at m16 :(]
;B[jb]L[nm][kf]C[Rob- k18 seems a little off the right track. o7 (a) or l14 (b) seem stronger moves for b..]
;W[me];B[nd];W[ng];B[lj];W[nm];B[jl]C[Rob- Again, a key point.];W[il]L[nf]C[Rob- An overplay by w. o14 (a) is a must here for w..];B[jk];W[ik]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[ij];W[ji];B[kg]C[Rob- I think l11 first was better. The threatened cut was something I think w had to respond to.]
;W[jg];B[kh]L[im][nf]C[Rob- This one is no good. b should either start pushing w around at j7 (a) or cut him at o14 (b).]
;W[li];B[mj];W[lh];B[nk];W[mm]C[Rob- The o14 cut grows enormous.];B[ml]
;W[lm];B[ll];W[kl]
(;B[im]L[om][hj]C[Rob- Good move..As the kibbers pointed out, p10 and then q11 made o14 atari, allowing you to connect, and incidentally, cutting w and putting him in an impossible situation, with the p7 (a) cut, and the connection at h10 (b) being miai to kill one or the other w group.]
;W[hl];B[jm];W[km];B[kk];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[ho]L[gn]M[gm][gl][hl][il]
[ik]C[Rob- This move probably should have been g6 (a). This threatens the marked w stones quite a bit..]
;W[gn];B[ip];W[jo];B[io];W[hr];B[hq];W[gq];B[iq];W[gr];B[go];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[em];B[dl];W[en];C[Rob- Frankly Rich, you just whupped my butt for most of this game. Your opening was strong and you fought well for most of the game. The only reason I had a chance was because I left out an important move.. (o14). I'd say f15 and k18 were the only real mistakes of comission you made. I can clearly see that my tutelage has helped quite a bit. :) :) :)]
