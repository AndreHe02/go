C[This is only my second week of playing go but i think i've improved from when i first started. I was not thinking straight near the begining in the upper left corner. I think the score woudl have been closer, had I taken this corner.]
PL[B];B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[dj];W[eh]C[corners, sides, centre - in that order. E12 doesnt acomplish any of those. it just sits there useles. K16, q10, p4 are points to consider.]

C[Should I have gone near K8 or L8 to force him towards my stones at f6 and e4?

you should hve first taken as much territory at the bottom as possible - then fight in the center. M3 would be a move I would consider]
