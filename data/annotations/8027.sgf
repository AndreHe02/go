;B[rn];W[jp]LB[lp:A][mo:B]C[This extension is way too far. Where should I have gone? Maybe O3 or O4?

The rule of thumb is number of stones plus 1.  There are two stones with an unbreakable connection, so 3 spaces.]

This is my first game against a 7k on KGS in which I actually managed to get a mojo like the one above.]
;W[cl];B[eq];W[or]C[The move looked small to me, but I was under the impression I needed to give stability to the corner.]

;B[ol];W[hn]C[The reason for these moves are pschologically:

a) I was playing a player way stronger than me and was happy how I was holding out
b)I really did not want to lose the group. At the same time my abillity to read more than two moves ahead was severly shrinkd by the tension and speed of the game.

So I made timid moves

If I hadn't lost the group at the left side it would have been close. One or two mistakes less and I might even have won. Against 7k that's a nice thing for me.

Actually that group on the left you lost was about 15 - 20 points, you still lost by around 20 - 25 points.  I don't know what rank you are, but I am not much better (if any) than a 7k on KGS, so did you get the guy you played to review this also?]
