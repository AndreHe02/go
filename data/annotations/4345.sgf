AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi i'm creeed, playing black.
Eventhough i felt ahead most of the game, i still lost by 9.5 pts.
i reviewed the game myself, and found some reasons for my loss. But i'm still a beginner and i'm sure i didn't notice a lot of other mistakes.
Some comments will help you to figure out what i was thinking (most of the time no one understands), but don't be afraid to comment any move :-) .

I don't know what i'm doing especially in the beginning of the game. I just play like i saw, or read. If you can also indicate the weaknesses (that i didn't take advantage of) in my opponents' game that'd be great.

You can (and should) review in your own way though, you know more than i do.
Thank for your time and patience Mr reviewer.];W[dd];B[jp];W[fq]

(;W[hr]LB[fo:B][hp:C][dq:A]C[At this point, you would have probably been able to take advantage of whiteby a move at A, or, if you wanted to give up the corner for a wall towards the center (influence), a move at B or C might be good.

It would just depend on what strategy you wanted to use at this point in the game. Start game or "fuseki" is played mostly on instinct.]

(;B[jr];W[iq];B[jq];W[dr];B[cq]LB[ho:A]C[i thought about trying to play G5 or something like that to shut down white's group.  But then white would have played C3-4 and i'd be without a base.

Your move here was fine. G15 seems to be a bit too close to the group you're trying to shut in. Maybe a move at A if you wanted to give up the corner for influence towards the center? (Not really advised, going for center territory is risky) A wouldn't shut white in all the way, but it would reduce the ways in which he can expand towards the center.]
;W[dq]LB[dn:B][cp:A]C[Black's next move doesn't really seem necessary to me. You are obviously worried about what would happen if white cut at A, but it is quite easy to defend because of the B stone. This leaves you a free move.]

(;B[co]C[probably not the best move of the game. Any idea?]

;W[fc];B[cj]LB[cg:C][ej:D][cl:A][dl:B]C[is it a good extension or too far?

Seems fine to me. If white tried to invade at either A or B, you can extend your stone to C. White shouldn't really invade, though. There are bigger moves available. 

Although, if white decides to extend his corner stone to C, you should probably defend that extension, maybe at B, or a jump to D.]
;W[cg];B[dj]LB[cc:B][ej:A]C[This move seems a little slow to me. If you want to do something, maybe a jump to A would have been better.

Also, something to keep in mind is a 3-3 invasion. (B) With white's formation as it is, an invasion over-concentrates his stones, and they no longer work effectively together in the way that white would want them to, as well as stealing the nice little corner of territory white is building for himself.]

;W[kd];B[ge];W[he];B[gd];W[jf]LB[ne:A][ri:B][nl:C][qo:D]C[Your P12 move here was ok, but usually when expanding like that, you move  on the side that your opponent already has a wall on. (Example: A) 

This tends to counter-act the influence of your opponent's wall, and gain you more territory, as your opponent isn't as well set up for jumping into your potential territory.

A couple of other moves that might threaten the R10 group would probably be B or C, or even D. Remember, the R10 group has enough space to live already.]

;W[od]LB[pc:B][oe:A]C[Your next move, at A, is quite small. It really only gains you roughly six points. My suggestion instead, if you wanted to defend this area, would be to play around B.]

If black does actually get one eye, perhaps through a white mistake, white can always connect underneath at B, destroying the second eye.

Just something to be careful of.]

;W[bs]C[White's position is actually quite weak. There are several ways to play this through and live by connecting with your B9 group, depending on what white chooses to do. 

Your connection also makes white's B1 group very easy to kill.]

As you saw before, the ko isn't necessary, but if you were forced to play it, you might try something like an atari at A, perhaps? White does have quite a few major ko threats, so a method to save the group involving ko isn't really advisable.

Remember:- A ko threat doesn't have to be a sensible move, just something that you can be sure that your opponent will reply to.]

Something to think about is that, although sente is always big, it's particularly big in endgame. Look carefully at your move, and read through it, and decide whether or not it keeps sente. If you want a move in sente, M18 is fine for that, I think.]
