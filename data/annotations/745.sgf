C[The game (played by E-mail over a period of nearly four months)
contains a lively discussion between the players during the game.

They asked me to review it so once in a while I add my comments
starting with [JS\].

Jan van der Steen];B[pd]C[Black - Joe Carl - jcarl@neo.lrun.com
White - Tim Hunt - T.J.Hunt@damtp.cam.ac.uk];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[pk];W[nc]TR[pk]LB[qk:A][jp:B][po:C][ok:D][mp:E]C[JC: This move itself is probably premature.
The black 4-4 stone  can be invaded at the 3-3.
It can be attacked on the right side, but  now it will be come settled.
Too early to tell if it is settled in whites  favor.

[JS\]
There is a subtle difference between the high and low Chinese fuseki
(the low Chinese fuseki has the marked stone at A).
In that case it's quite normal to develop the top with o17 because the
moyo which black will build with B has various weak points (like C and D).
In case of the high Chinese fuseki the weakness at D doesn't exist so
in that case taking the fuseki point at B (or first forcing with E for C)
is a little more urgent than o17.]
(;B[qf]LB[pf:A][jp:B]C[[JS\]
It doesn't seem in the spirit of the other high black stones to play this
low move. The usual (and best move) here is either A or play tenuki
and take the first class fuseki point at B (see diagrams).]
;W[pb];B[lc]LB[jp:A][fq:B][po:C][md:D]TR[pq][pk]C[TH: This is probably a good move.
(I expect that we will be able to delete the word probably once
the game has developed a bit.)

TH: Well it seemed to work.

[JS\]
Black is thinking too local here: the best move is still to take A at the bottom.
I don't think black should be too eager to have a stone at the top since
white is low there so the top doesn't seem to be very valuable.
A black stone at A however makes the other marked black stones
look very happy. Besides, black A has a nice follow-up at B, C, and D,
making the opening almost play itself.]
(;W[qc]LB[ne:A]C[[JS\]
White is obeying black's orders here.
Considering the importance of the center in this game
white could consider to play A instead (see diagram).]
(;B[oc]C[TH: I now see no reason not to play the standard joseki from this  point on.

[JS\]
Black can avoid complications by playing A immediately, see diagram.]

(;W[od]C[[JS\]
White has no reasons not to be satisfied with the normal variation,
see diagram.];B[nd];W[oe];B[pc];W[ob];B[qd];W[md]LB[nb:A][mc:B]
C[TH: I think that this is either a tesuji or an overplay.

[JS\]
This move allows black to cut white to pieces with A,
normal for white is B in this position.];B[nb];W[ne];B[mb]C[TH: i think that black should play atari at N17 at some point.
It  forces white into very bad shape without doing black too much  harm.

[JS\]
If black gives atari with N17 white would gain since it would give
her the option to start a ko with N18 (later) for connection once
the outside stones got into distress.]
(;W[rd]C[[JS\]
Better to play as in the diagram.];B[pf]C[JC: I couldn't think of a good response, so I settled for this.

TH: I think this is an ordinary move. Anything else is bad shape
and leaves bad aji. I still have to go back and live in the corner.

[JS\]
Agree with Tim. In Go simple is often the best.];W[rb];B[ic]
TR[pf][qf][nb][mb][lc][oc][pc][pd][qd]C[JC: Seems I should worry about the top and get settled but I'm at
a loss on how to play properly here. :(

I know joseki, but not much else it seems :)

TH: You definitely need to play a move somewhere here to settle
your group - you have certainly found the right direction.
There are  some other possibilities.

[JS\]
The thinking here is: while black's marked groups are strong
white's cutting stones in the center have no purpose but to
be weak, so your move is fine.]
(;W[nh]C[JC: This is an interesting move.

TH: Well I have to do something for this group before you launch an
all-out attack that lets you win the game. Which direction to extend
was an interesting question.

JC: I need another on the side but it gets crowded no matter what I
do, q9 is one space too far away

[JS\]
White wants to prevent the flow in the diagram...]
(;B[ph]LB[pi:A]C[TH: Do you really need another move here? I think that when you
play here you have made my previous move into a forcing move.

This move is a defensive move. Did you consider the proverb
"force  before defending" before playing this move?

[JS\]
Locally, better shape seems A (better balance and the marked stone
will be stronger which is useful in future fights in the lower-right).
But did you consider immediate action as in the diagram?]
(;W[jp]LB[kd:A][de:B]TR[pk][pq]C[JC: I think you should have played top left

TH: Playing this way stops black building on a large scale.
It also reaches out a helping hand to the floating white group.
I think that this move is mostly about the balance of influence,
not the balance  of territory.

[JS\]
This is still a very good point to occupy (for both).
Once white has a stone here the marked black stones look less happy.
And Tim is right that this stone also provides a little help to the
weak group in the center.
But before occupying this important point white should try to force
with A to strengthen the white group in the center a little bit, see variation.

Anyway, Joe is also right that in the top-left white usually would
play B quickly since Black B is an annoying move for white,
see another variation.]
(;B[de]C[TH: This is undoubtedly a good point, but I am not sure that it is
clearly bigger than my last move.

LY: Black should attack immediately at N14.

[JS\]
Who is LY? :)
Let's examine N14 in a variation...];W[ci]LB[dh:a][di:b]TR[de]
C[JC:  I'll admit I don't know anything related to this move.
If you had played at "a" instead then you would be inviting the
Magic sword of Muramasa, a very hair-raising variation!

TH: Yes, exactly. I decided that discretion was the better part of
valour here. I can't afford anything attackable on the board with my
existing weak group in place so I don't want my pincer stone to end
up too close to any thickness you might build here.

[JS\]
The white move is very loose with respect to the marked black
stone, locally I therefore prefer white A or B.];B[fd]C[[JS\]
Natural move: connecting the stones while attacking white.]
;W[cd]TR[ci]LB[fb:A]C[TH: This is not a real move. It's just feeble.

[JS\]
Agree, this move hurts the marked white stone (see the continuation
in the diagram for details).
I would play A instead.]
(;B[eb]LB[ce:A]TR[cd][dc]C[TH: This is essentially just an endgame move. A very big
endgame move, but still an endgame move.

[JS\]
Black prevents the white slide to A but Go theory says that
black A instead is perfect for various reasons:
1. it splits white
2. the marked white stones are in bad shape
The variation shows some continuations...
Besides, black's last move plays from strength (the top)
instead of forcing the opponent to play towards this strength.]
;W[ce]C[[JS\]
White virtually connecting his stones.];B[df]LB[cf:A][dg:B]
C[[JS\]
Not much need for black to play more moves here.
Maybe later you can aim A or B instead.];W[cf]LB[dg:A][ch:B]
C[TH: This appears to be the only move. There is just one little
problem with it I fear.

TH: Read Lessons in the Fundamentals on the subject of pushing
fights like this.

[JS\]
Not sure what Tim is refering to here, maybe pushing from behind?
Anyway, white has no choice but to connect his stones and black
has no choice but to finish the shape with A for B.
This is called "soba" in Japanese which is hard to translate but means
something in the line of: "moving the stones in the way they were
intended, natural play".]
(;B[le]C[TH: I've been waiting for that to happen.

LY: N14 is a better way to start the attack.

[JS\]
This move enables the sequence in the diagram
so I wonder if this is the way to attack white.
But also see my remarks in the previous diagram.]
(;W[dg]TR[df][de]C[TH: I don't think that you should let me hane at the head of
2 stones. You could have played here in sente and then launched
your attack which would have been backed up by even more thickness
and so be better.

JC: I didn't think you'd follow along with that plan.
So I took my  profit and can rebuild the moyo in time.
However since my moyo is  gone as well, then I consider
reducing moves. It seems that you capturing the blacked
marked stones is not as big as my capture

TH: I don't consider these stones captured,

[JS\]
White's last move is not a big deal. We should realize that
black's marked stones were kikashi stones (white answered
both these stones so in a sense black got these two stones
for free). So black is not too attached to them.]
(;B[mf]C[TH: This comment got lost. I'm putting it back.

JC: I think this is much bigger then the head of two stones.

I think you should have responded in top right.
I don't see how you  are going to get away, and I'm terribly thick there now

TH: Ah, but what if I don't intend to run away? Before that white
group was a complete liability. It had at most 1/2 an eye and was
sitting in the middle of your sphere of influence. I had to be very
careful not to let you get too much influence or it would just die.

Now it is a a dead white group sitting in the middle of some black
territory. You now have to be careful not to let me make too much
thickness or it might suddenly spring back to life. It's your turn
to worry.

Also if we try and count how much territory your last 2 moves have
made it is probably just under 20 points. Is this efficient use of
2 moves at this stage? Well, all I can say is that I am happy.

LY: Giving up the white stones is probably too big for white to allow.

[JS\]
I agree with LY, this is a nearly clean capture of white's stones, good for black.]
;W[fg]TR[nh][ne][oe][od][md][nc]LB[mp:A][po:B][dn:C]C[TH: This strikes me as the focal point of 2 moyos.

JC: Since you capped me at d13, I don't have a moyo.
 exchange

[JS\]
Nice move, although there are many right now: A (for B)
and next C for example is very big. The move in the game
makes black feel slightly uncomfortable about the aji
of the marked stones (see later).];B[jj]TR[fg]LB[ld:A][og:B]
[nf:C][lp:D][fq:E][cn:F]C[JC: You don't dare attack lower right, it could become huge now,
and if you do, I will do as much damage to your left position as you
do to my right.  I'll possibly do more damage then you can do.

Looking at the board I see:

White: 10 points top right,  15 points top left, 20 points bottom left
Black: 15 top, 20 capture, 40 right side and threatening even more yet.

TH: I'm happy.

JC: Interesting you claim you are happy too.
I'd love to hear what a dan level player would say about our game :)

TH: Yes, you're right, I certainly have my work cut out for me.
There is no point in me trying to stick to the fundamentals if you
are going to win by employing some low trick like making lots of
secure territory :-)

LY: It is not too late for white to pull his 'dead' stones out.

TH: I can't remember which of the marked moves Yajie recommended.
I had a look at them whilst we were playing but I
wasn't sure that they worked.

[JS\]
First of all, I don't like this move. The marked white stone reduces the
value of this stone beforehand. Besides, if this move is intended to
reduce the aji of the captured white stones in the center then it's
better to play a clear move like A (or one point below C).
This would remove nearly all worries for black.
In this position I like black D which is big. If black prefers to invade then
E or F are both feasible. But since black is doing well territorial playing
simple with D is my preference.

About the aji of either A, B or C for white in this position see the next
three diagrams.]
(;W[ig]C[TH: There were a lot of good points available.];B[kh]
;W[np]LB[mp:A][nq:B][mq:C][lp:D][po:E][pp:F]C[JC: Very interesting Move!  I've never seen this before.

TH: Well the last "big point" seems to be in this area of the board.
It is hard to say which of the  points A, b or C is correct.

If white doesn't play round here then black plays D which
probably forces white to invade, black attacks and gets thick and
white's moyo becomes worthless.

I did not like the feel of the 3rd line move, you can just build up
your territory with leaning moves.

JC: It feels right, yet wrong.

TH: I have no idea.

JC: All your stones are on the 4th line and not doing anything but
reducing my moyo potential.  It seems all your influence making
moves end up not yielding influence ...

Yes, your move at K10 really irritates me. It gives suprising
amounts of influence and makes it very hard for me to secure my moyo.

JC: ... or territory.

I get.

JC: And yet it does interfere with my right side potential.

Indeed.

JC: I guess this is an erasing move?

LY: Black should hold back to N4.

[JS\]
I agree with LY.
Let me discuss A through C...
[A\] Leaves no invasion point and has a nice follow-up at E.
[B\] Has follow-up at F but leaves an invasion point when black
defends with E.
[C\] Doesn't have such a nice follow-up as A, too low.];B[qo]
LB[po:A]C[JC: I'll just take profit for now. A rich man does not look for fights

TH: The proper move here is surely on the 4th line.

LY: Yes, no reason not to make 4th line territory in the corner.

[JS\]
Agree, should be at A.];W[pl]TR[qo]LB[dn:A][fp:B]C[TH: The aim of this move is to make you wish that you had
played 'triangle' on the 4th line (whilst reducing your territory).

TH: I now think that this was a bad move.
It just helps black solidify  the centre.

[JS\]
It's too early to start actions here while the left side and the bottom
are still waiting for enforcement. I would play A or B here.]

(;B[ol]C[JC: We'll have to see how this goes.
This is the part of the game I am weak!

I can play opening and end game, but am lost in the middle game.

[JS\]
Please see the diagram for some comments on this position.]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[pm]C[TH: How about that for sticking to the fundamentals.
Just  connect; don't get cut.];B[ok]LB[rl:A]C[JC: I'll protect my cut, and see what I can't do about attacking
you next or someplace else.
The center seems ruined for either of us.
Time to invade at C3 I think (if I get out of this with sente)

TH: Yes, very good move. This sort of move is so easy to overlook,
but it just works and leaves absolutely no bad aji.
The Japanes  word is 'honte' which is normally translated
as 'the proper move'.

[JS\]
Big move useful for the center fighting, and also sets up the connection at A
(endgame).];W[nn]LB[qm:A]C[TH: It is very difficult to find a good move to connect
out with  round here. I think that connecting out is important
though. For a start if I do not play here you could play here
forcing me to connect  really submissively.
Alternatively you could separate and attack my 3 stones.

[JS\]
This is the move which white should have played immediately
(locally) aiming at a deep invasion with A or one lower (tsuke) next.]
;B[cq]LB[cn:A][fq:B]TR[jj]C[TH: I have been unable to find a convincing defensive move
in this part of the board so my plan recently has been to play
round the edges of this moyo and wait for you to invade.

I am not convinced that this is your best invasion point.

LY: Better to invade on the side at A.

[JS\]
LY is right again (I think LY is a strong player).
The theory to choose between A or B: choose the wider side.
Your invasion with san-san might make it harder to control
the lower-left part of the board although the marked black stone
will prevent that white becomes too large here.];W[cp]LB[nr:A]
C[TH: I am fairly confident that this is the 'wider side'.

[JS\]
Agree, besides the bottom is open at A so this move is ok.]

(;B[bp]C[JC: I expect to end with sente and do more damage

TH: I still don't understand this move, or your comment.
I cannot think what joseki you are thinking of.];W[dq]C[JC: Wow! You want sente bad!

TH: Not necessarily. But since you didn't play here I thought
I would. It keeps you pressed down low, and gives me options
on the corner territory.

[JS\]
Agree with Tim, white's bottom becomes very big now and black is
terribly low.];B[bo];W[bq]C[TH: This move leaves bad aji. I hope I can get away with it.

JC: Indeed it does. Now I can play on the side and a decide best
how to activate C3 if I ever do.  C3 is going to be problematic
for you!
Additionally you will have problems on lower side once I get settled

TH: Yes, but at the moment my main concern is to give you
problems for this weak black group you are constructing
in my sphere of influence. (or that is how I want to look at it.)

LY: black is in trouble.];B[ck]C[TH: This looks like an overplay for black.

LY: better at C8 or C7.];W[cm]C[TH: I hope that this isn't an overplay.]
;B[bm]C[JC: I wouldn't call black's group on the side a weak one.

[JS\]
It's very weak :)];W[bl]C[TH: I hope to demonstrate that it is weak. That seems to be my
best hope of winning.]
(;B[cn]C[JC: gonna get interesting! I'm winging everything at this point

TH: What do you mean winging?
Is it a typo for winning, or is it some bit of american idiom
I am unfamiliar with.

JC: Winging it is an idiom, I think it comes from aviation.
Where they don't use instruments and just going with gut instinct.
Comes from "with a wing and a prayer."

Thus winging it is taking your best guess or making it up as you go.]
;W[cl]TR[ck][cm]C[TH: I don't think you should let me play here.
The triangles exchange seems to be a straight loss for you.
Your group now has no more than 1 eye and with any luck
I can make territory both above and below as it runs out.
Well, we'll have to see.

JC: I didn't think of this move!];B[en]C[JC: If  I compare the territories I think Black leads even if the
bottom and top right turn into territory for you

Rough estimate is:

    Black 80
    White 60

How far off am I?

TH: Well, that looks like the right ball park to me,
but I would say at least +-10 error on both estimates
which is my justification for not resigning yet.
There are also some very large endgame moves to be had,
Anyway, we are still in the middle game here.
The other point to make is that up until your invasion at move 53
we had both been playing in black's sphere of influence.
Now at last we are playing in white's sphere of influence and so
perhaps I can make some headway for a change.

[JS\]
In positions like this, in the middle of a fight, it's useless
to count territory since the position is too "hot".];W[fl]LB[fp:A]
C[... in the corner will hopefully limit you movement round here
so I can get away with an all-out move.

LY: Better to make territory at the bottom by playing at A.]
;B[gn];W[hl]C[TH: I can't work out whether to peep at F5 or not.
It might end up just helping you so I didn't.];B[fp]C[JC: I better do this while I have the chance]
;W[cr];B[hp];W[eo]C[TH: Is this just horribly vulgar?

Note that with respect to the white stones I am playing at the
centre of symetrical shape!];B[do]C[... wondered by good players play moves that obviously
don't work. It's because they are trying to make something else sente.

TH: I don't think that it is the only move. The solid connection is better.]
;W[ep];B[in];W[fn]C[TH: I can't quite tell if this works
(as in captures your group cleanly) but I am going to play
it anyway. As far as I can see you  get cut into 2 weak groups
and I don't fall apart too drastically, so we shall have to see.]
;B[fm]C[JC: I didn't see this move!

TH: I felt sure that my move 71 was sente, which is why I was
suprised when you tenukied after white 73];W[fo];B[em]TR[fp]
[gn][in][hp]C[JC: Going to get interesting!

JC: I don't think of the marked stones as weak,
I think of them as light.
I'm willing to give some of them up, and they seem resilient to me

TH: I agree.];W[gm]C[TH: There is a small risk that I fall apart,
but even so this must be the only move.
It's your turn to worry for a bit (evil snigger).];B[el]C[JC: Looks like I have to give something up!]
;W[dk]TR[ck]LB[ek:A][dj:B]C[... is not such a bad move to have been forced to make.
LY: Better (less bad aji I think) to connect underneath with B9.

[JS\]
Agree with LY, now black A could aim B next.];B[ek]C[JC: Looks like the only move again]

(;W[dj]LB[gj:A]C[LY: White can just play at A and kill black.

[JS\]
Agree, also with the variations.];B[gj]C[JC: I hope I escape with this move.]
;W[hn]C[TH: Time to eliminate my own worries.

JC: A very good move indeed!];B[fk]C[... count out exactly how much each move is worth.
But also we are  only just into the endgame and so it
is not all about territory. Thickness still has lots of value,
and weaknesses still are costly.];W[ml]TR[oo][in][hp][fp][gn]
C[TH: This is the move I chose.
I don't think that it is the biggest in  terms of pure territory,
but it seems to do a lot. It provides some  protection against your
irritating peep; it heads towards cutting off the triangled
stones; it pokes its way into your territory in the centre.

I'm far too mean to tell you where I think the other 3 big points are!
Of course before I made this move I had to count the position.

White: total 65
  Left side: 22
  Top right: 8
  Bottom: 35 ish.

Black: total 75
  Top edge: 15
  Middle into right edge: 45
  Bottom right: 15

I seem to have caught up a bit.
With sente I have everything to fight for.
The real question is how much white territory there is along the bottom.]
;B[gl]C[JC: I'll take this forcing move first which secures my safety
as well as threatening to destroy your bottom.

TH: This is certainly a move I must respond to, but it is not a pure
forcing move for you. You are loosing options for your 4 stones in
the middle of the bottom. This is obvously a good move for you to
play, the only question is "is now the right time?".

Well the above was my initial reaction to your move.
In fact, since I  have 2 valid ways of answering it perhaps
you are probing my intentions before deciding how to reduce my lower side.]
;W[go]C[TH: The aim of this move is to guarantee myself a certain
minimum amount of territory.];B[jl]TR[in][hp]C[JC: I believe this elminates any posibility of you trying to cut me
off and really brings out the aji in the marked stones];W[ik]
C[TH: Very vulgar, but I seem to get away with it just.];B[ij]
;W[hk];B[hj]C[JC: I need to uncomplicate this game if I'm going to pull it off.
I'll take the safe solid simple move.];W[jk];B[kk]C[JC: Should get interesting.]
;W[kl];B[ll]C[JC: Not the side I thought you were going to cut on

TH: The cut on the other side just does not work. Wite extends to M9.]
;W[km];B[lk]C[JC: Looks like I'll end with sente.
I should look for those big points you were talking about.

i.]
(;W[or]TR[lm]C[TH: I have some worries about what you can do to break into my
territory in the middle, but I can't see anything really
devistating for you, so I think that sealing off the lower edge is bigger.

LY: It is better to play at the marked point
(then it is still not too late to try and rescue white's 'dead' group.]
;B[lm]C[JC: P2 was a mistake. You had to cover your hole at M7!!

JC: I'll live in the corner, perhaps a bit smaller then before,
but this is devestating.

TH: So was a black move at O2. I had to make a choice.
I may well have got it wrong.

TH: But I think that the result in the game worked out O.K. for me.
I stand by my move at P2.];W[kn]C[TH: I hope this holds together.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[lp]C[JC: The only move ! :)

TH: I thought so, but is it good enough?];B[mp];W[lq]C[TH: I am beginning to think that you were right and that I
defended in the wrong place.

JC: I was so hoping you would play n3

TH: You can't go round expecting your opponent to play bad
moves. (Past evidence not withstanding!).]
(;B[no];W[op]TR[kl][km][kn]MA[ik]C[TH: I hope I can play here and not fall apart.
The bad aji of the three triangled stones continues to plague me.

I now think that my move marked square was terrible (unless we
change the game to 6-in-a-row!) Look how strong you have
become as a result. Even if I get away from the lower edge with
enough territory to fight on you can have a field day at the top.

sequence out to the end and be 100% certain I was going to come

peep I might have been able to go to work near the top and you

I broadly agree with you assesment that you are 5 points behind,
only I think that it might be closer than that.

JC: True but I have 15 point sente move after this.

I hope not, I don't see where. And if you did that 15 point
followup value would get added to the original value of the
move so it would be nearer 20 points gote, except if the
followup is 15 points sente this move would actually be sente
because I have to respond.];W[sg]C[TH: This is either 8 points sente, or more than that gote,
so bigger than your last move.];B[rg]C[JC: Go ahead and complete this sequence until
I need to defend properly.];W[sf];B[sh];W[re];B[rf];W[se]C[TH: Is this what you meant?]
;B[rh]C[TH: Bad move. At some point in the last sequence you should
have taken time out to play P6 in sente.
At first I thought P6 was 10 points sente for you.
Now I think that it might actually be 7 points double sente.
Excepty that rgg claims that double sente does not mean that.

... ove.
Both these moves are worth just under 10 points so they
should be treated as miai. You should not let me get both.]
;W[nm]C[JC: I wasn't counting these as captured anyway.
Thus these are 10 point gote.
If I didn't play S12 then you would take even more in sente.
I toyed around with other protection spots other then s12,
but they got messy, and I didn't want to you help you more
than I already have.

TH: But your move at P6 to cut them off was sente because it
threatened to cut at Q5 next.
Therefore this move is 10 points reverse sente for me.];B[cb]
C[TH: This is certainly a big move for you.
Especially since D18 is fairly sente for me, threatening to descend
to H18 and start a ko for 8 of your black stones.

unclear followups so I can't count them.

;B[hq];W[gr];B[lr];W[mr];B[oq];W[nq]C[Black resigns.

TH: I think that the most dramatic thing that I learnt
from this game is the difference between the result you
get playing in your opponents sphere of influence and your
own sphere of influence.

I think that the main white mistakes or questionable moves where:

1) the sequence in the top right corner in the opening.
   This result was unfavorable for white. Perhaps to the tune of 5 points.

2) Sacrificing the white group floating in the top right corner.
   This was a bold plan, and white got quite a lot a compensation
   in reducing white's moyo. Perhaps this loss was also about 5 points.

3) The move at C16 was a mistake, but went unpunished.
    White should have got shut into the corner.

4) The move at Q8 mostly helped black to solidify the centre territory,
   but at the same time it eliminated black's territory on the lower right side.

5) White missed a reasonable chance to kill the black group comming
   out from the lower left side.

6) The white move at J9 succeeded in taking a lot of territory
   at the bottom, but made white strong in the centre and nearly
   cost a lot of territory there.

I think that the main black mistakes or questionable moves where:

1) Not punishing C16.

2) Allowing a hane at the head of two stones at D13.

3) Invading at C3, not C6.

4) Not playing a standard 3-3 invasion line but trying something
   'clever' instead which just produced a weak group.

5) Failing to treat white's move at E5 as a forcing move and getting
   into trouble.

6) Ending up loosing the semei in the top left. The cutting move
   at G13 was a good move, but somewhere in the followup something went wrong.

7) In the big endgame moves after black lost the semeai I think that
   black lost about 10 points.])
