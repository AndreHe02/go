C[I played black in this game and lost by resignation after failing a rather deep invasion.  How can I awoid needing to try this invasion?

Thank you for reviewing my game.

Bink: Try to play more for influence and less for territory. If you have a rather territorially oriented style and your oponent plays for influence and moyo, it is rather clear, that at some point you will have to invade deeply. This is not necessarily a bad strategy, but you will need to be rather skillful at Sabaki for that. After looking at the game it seems to me, that you also have to try a more attacking, influence oriented style to become a well balanced Go player. Sometimes you are not using weaknesses of your oponent.

The following theme is connected with that: Try to play more flexible. I think strong Go players think very often about the effectiveness of a stone when playing it, and they dont necessarily have already a fixed plan for that stone.  They will develop that stone flexible, depending on the circumstances. Your moves are quite often single purpose territory moves.]

(;B[jq]C[B: K4 is better. You should not go for territory but rather for influence in a moyo game.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[B: Good!];W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[oh];W[nh]
(;B[id]C[B: This is the right direction. But here I would play low (J17) as you are playing in whites sphere of influence. This is more stable. If white plays G17 you should play J15. This would also weaken the white stones around O17.]
;W[gc]C[Your move J16 makes G17 sente. The most solid move would now be J17. But this would just show, that your move J16 was bad. (The two stones on J17 and J16 are inferior to the two stones on J17 and J15)]
;B[hc]C[B: The whole exchange is not good for you. as white answers G16 there will b nearly no Aji left in the white position. But white has still the very nice invasion point K17. That is the reason J17 looks better to me. With Black J17 there would be possibilities for black in the white corner and blacks position would be solid.
(By the way: At this moment white should not invade at K17 as his string of stones starting with O17 is to weak. But if those stones become stronger you have left this invasion point behind)]
;W[gd]C[E: I feel that this can't be a bad position for me.  Also closing the corner with r5 seems natural as there seems to be no good attack against the black string of stones.

B: You are right, your position is not bad (except for your attackable stones around J16), but R5 is a bad move now.

There are two reasons R5 is bad.

The specific reason:
In this game the upper right  region is a hot region.  There is a weak white group and a weak black group. whoever plays first will strengthen his group and weaken oponents group and get an advantage.

The general reason:
when you play the chinese opening you welcome an invasion of white at R5!  This game is a game of two moyos. If you play a territorial move like R5 your oponent will make his moyo bigger and you will have to invade oponents moyo. Your main question was "How can I avoid to need to invade" the key to the answer to this question is in this position and in your move R5. You dont really want to invade (especially if you dont have central influence). Your oponent doesnt want to invade. So force him to invade by not playing R5. You will get an attack, you will get some territory and get enough influence, so that you will be in a better position to invade.
If you play a move like F4 the oponent will not get a big moyo but you will.

But now lets get back to the more specific reason in this game: you have to attack the string of white stones.
I agree, I also do not find a really convincing attack. Nonetheless those stones do not easily live on their own, and they have a far way to go to their alleys, one must attack them!

I would attack at K13. (Other possible moves include moves like K11.)  K13 invites white to push along on line O giving you forth-line territory in return.
Also a move around K13 will probably give you some central influence as soon as white starts to struggle for life.

It might well be that a stronger player then me would find a better point to start the attack. But anyway it is going to be your game and you will have to find your own attacking move. But my main point is: Attack from this side! Your goal in attacking is not so much to kill the white group, but to get profit and influence while white answers your attacking moves. An invasion will be easier then (if it turns out to be necessary).]

(;B[qo];W[pb];B[qc];W[if]C[B: Now white has the advantage. His stones will all become strong, and white has all the influence, it will be hard for black to invade.]
;B[ke];W[kg];B[he]C[B: Not good. You are helping white to get even more influence. Leave things open! It might be that your invasion stones later want to use a sente move like G14 later which white will answer at H15.]
;W[gg];B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[E: Should this have been at k5?
B: No, at F5! F5 is the key point to develop both moyos. F5 builds your own moyo and hinders white to build his moyo.]
;W[go]
(;B[hp]C[E: Is this to passive, considering that the corner is open?
B: yes it is to passive.  And it is to much a territorial move considering all the influence white has. Let me again answer your starting question: If you make a lot of territorial moves and your oponent makes all the moyo oriented moves, there will be no help for it: You will have to invade deeply and you have to have good skills at Sabaki. This is a feasable strategy. You need to be good at Sabaki for that.
If you want to avoid that, then you have to make less territorial moves and have to play more influence moves like K5. 

But: Apart from your bad result at the top I dont think your position is not so much worse then whites. You have the lead in secure territory, but white has overwhelming influence.]
;W[in];B[cj]C[Now I had to do something with either white's center or side.  So I shoot for the side.

B: The move is good! You should be able to live.];W[ci];B[ck]
C[B: bad! You are making yourself heavy! If all your invading stones form one group, it is easy for the oponent to attack that group. Play lightly! Form several groups and dont commit yourselve which group you want to keep. Stated otherwise play flexible!

In fact now look at your position overall: For every single stone you placed on the board its purpose is already fixed. Most of them have the purpose to build territory on the side.
If you see the game of a very strong player you will see the main difference: A lot of stones dont have such a clear purpose yet. The stones are placed so that they have as much power as possible. It is not so clear yet how this power is going to be used later. The strong players play flexible. You will have trouble to predict were exactly all the future territory will be. 
So: Try to play more flexible overall.

In this particular position the light move is D11. It is impossible to predict what is going to happen later. Maybe later you play C16 (depending on the continuation from the cross cut)]
;W[bi]C[B: That is the right white attacking move. Black is in a difficult (or maybe evern hopeless) position now.]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[el];W[dm];B[dl];W[fk]C[I think white attacks from the wrong direction here. There are weaknesses in the white position below to exploit.]
;B[fl];W[gk]
(;B[fn]C[B: This move helps white do defend his cuts. Try to cut directly with F5. You might be able to attack the white stone J6 at the end. Maybe one should prepare F5 by first playing G8 (see variation). Your stone F6 helps you far less then whites stone F5 is going to help white.]
