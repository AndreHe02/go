AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer!

Thank you for taking time to help me. I hope to be able to help the go society myself one day (real soon!) :)

I'm Thobe, ranked 22k after this game(21k before). It was played on KGS against a 18k, I'm playing black with 3 stones handicap. I will be adding questions, but please point out other things as well!

Also, this is the first time I turn in a game for review, so please if I did something wrong, please, don't hesitate to mention it!

Thank you!

------------------------------------

Hi there!

I am SadSido, a 12k player from Saint-Petersburg, Russia, and I will be reviewing this game. I've added answers to your questions and provided some variations to clarify things. Enjoy!

p.s. and sorry for my english in case you'll find any mistakes =)]
;W[dd]C[Thobe [21k\]: hi
Thobe [21k\]: have fun! :)];B[cn];W[fq]C[jojoow [18k\]: have fun too]
(;B[eo]C[[SadSido\]

The E5 move is bad. It does almost nothing - it neither attacks white, nor protects the corner, nor gives you any territory. We should not waste moves, especially in the beginning - please see variations.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[cp];B[co];W[bo]
(;B[bn]C[[SadSido\]

Also, blocking white with B6 is not necessary. You have bigger moves to consider: see the variations...]
;W[ao]
(;B[bp]C[This move is my first mistake. if I would have played contined to surround W instead of trying to cut, how could I have invaded and killed his/her stones?

[SadSido\]

I think, you are too concerned about killing White here =) White have invaded under you stones, so you feel like you were robbed... But actually, your moves from 5 to 14 are a fair trade. White has taken territory under your stones, but in return you have built a thick Black wall above White stones. Now you must think of how to make profit of you wall, not how to kill White!]
;W[bq];B[cs];W[bs];B[ar]C[Here I tried to somewhat stop W from creating early and easy eyes, good or bad?

[SadSido\]

Bad rather than good. It does not kill White (see variation), and it forces White to answer. This move could be a great ko-threat in case of the ko-fight...]
(;W[go]
(;B[lq]C[[SadSido\]

At this point I don't understand the idea of playing A2 now. You were planning to kill White weren't you? So, White group stands ready to be killed and you suddenly switch to M3. 

Please see the variation.];W[nq];B[np];W[pq];B[op];W[qq];B[oq]
;W[or];B[pr]C[still feel like I'm playing "correctly" so far..

[SadSido\]

Cutting enemy groups is always a good idea =)];W[qr];B[nr];W[os]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[rq]C[probably a bad move, right?

[SadSido\]

Oh. This should be at S5, sealing White in the corner. I think you were still obsessed with the idea of killing White, while it easier to surround White and force him to live with no territory.]
;W[rr];B[sp]C[[SadSido\]

Again! This should be at S5];W[ro];B[rn];W[so];B[qo];W[sq]C[And here his group is safe, sound and alive. Any way I could have prevented that?

[SadSido\]

You can be satisfied with the current result. You could be even more satisfied if you had sealed White group 2 or 3 turns before - now you have a cutting point at R6 to worry about.

I'll repeat once again - corner invasions are a trade, not a robbery. If White is invading your corner, stay calm and seal in inside. You'll get your wall and you'll turn it into territory later.]
;B[ql];W[cj]
(;B[dl]C[[SadSido\]

Not OK. Another example of a wasted move. Serves no goal: does not attack White, does not give territory, does nothing. See the variations for the possible moves...]

jojoow [18k\]: hehe


[SadSido\]

This move is wasted by White. Black can abandon a pair of stones and make a bigger move (see variations)]
(;B[cm];W[am]C[[SadSido\]

White wastes another move. Hoping that Black will miss the atari and won't answer?]
;B[an]C[[SadSido\]

After Black A6, White ruined his bottom-right corner group. Now, Black does not need to make any moves - White is dead as it stands. No so great...]
;W[bi]
(;B[pi]C[[SadSido\]

Good! Black is the first to understand, that there are bigger moves than cutting pairs of stones from each other =)

Black has many stones on the right side already. Why not invest some stones to the upper side to keep balance? See variations...]
;W[qf]
(;B[pg]C[still trying to play to make strong shapes/connections, mainly thinking about liberties and making my stones live instead of focusing on taking territory.

[SadSido\]

When White is invading your moyos like this, you should go for territory (the territory is the thing that wins you the game, isn't it?) White is weak and it is a perfect target for attacking. It is another kind of a trade: White gets a group running away from your moyo, you get a territory while attacking White.

b.t.w, as we can see later, you were definitely not thinking about liberties =)]
;W[nc]C[[SadSido\]

At this moment, your corner Q16 stone is under pressure from two sides. You can again consider a dual purpose move (see variation) - linking to the corner and splitting White into weak groups.]
(;B[md];W[qc];B[qd];W[rc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]C[Now, a bit risky, but is it a terrible move or not? at least W didn't try to cut it but felt threatned instead..?

[SadSido\]

White cannot cut at P17 - Black will answer with R18 and both White groups will have a hard time. See variation...]
(;W[pa];B[oc]C[[SadSido\]

You can still put some pressure with P19 and then connect at P17]
;W[rd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[rf]C[probably not the best move.. But from here on and out I feel like I lost... sente?

[SadSido\]

Once again, you make an attempt to cut, but you should just seal White inside. You should think twice before you cut at the second line - it is almost always useless. Q14 is a correct move here.]
;W[rg];B[qg];W[pf];B[of];W[sf];B[pe];W[rf];B[rh];W[sh]C[[SadSido\]

Wasted move by White. No territory, no profit. Does not worth playing for now.]
;B[si]C[[SadSido\]

Oh. Double hane does not work here - too many cutting points. See variation...]
(;W[sg];B[ri]
(;W[rb]C[jojoow [18k\]: thx
Thobe [21k\]: np, but no more from now on :)

[SadSido\]

Both White moves are a waste of time. S18 is not required to live]
(;B[kc]C[[SadSido\]

Not OK. You already have three walls, traded for White's corners. Now you need to make some profit out of them - so think of a "bigger" (no, "BIGGER") moves =) See variation...]
;W[og]
(;B[ng]C[[SadSido\]

White made a cut, so you must reinforce the groups, that have been cut. Killing the cutting stone is ok, if you have a 100% confidence in your success - it means that you have read all possible White answers and White cannot escape.

Here you attack White while being weak yourself. Take your time and protect the threat at O14. Don't worry - White won't get far away with his P13 stone =)]
;W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh]C[[SadSido\]

There is a good explanation here. Imagine, that you are chasing White in a ladder, but the ladder does not work. Will you continue chasing? No, because chasing in a ladder leaves behind a lot of cutting points, so White will cut you at the moment, the ladder will be broken.

What we see here is basically the same thing - you are chasing White in a ladder that does not work. So, you are leaving cutting points behind and White will ruin your position.]
;W[nf]
(;B[ne]C[Got kind of rushed into this position and realized how bad my shape hade become. But still feels like I could avoid the Q16 group from becoming a dumpling, am I right? Or should I've already have considerd them lost?

[SadSido\]

See the variation. Now you are the one, who is being chased, so you should reinforce your stones. You are still trying to attack, but it is critical to defend.]
;W[oe]
(;B[od]C[[SadSido\]

Again, you can still play O16 (see variation). White won't be able to cut it at this moment]
;W[of];B[mf];W[nd]
(;B[nb]C[[SadSido\]

At this point I'd prefer to sacrifice the fat group and try to fix my wall on the upper side. Please see variation...]
;W[mc]
(;B[lb]C[[SadSido\]

That won't work. If you are still planning to save a fat group (actually a bad idea), play N18 instead. See variation...]
;W[mb];B[ma]C[Here I should probably have connected at N15 am I right?]
;W[me];B[ld];W[oa];B[oi];W[ph]
(;B[qh]C[[SadSido\]

The two stones, you save, are worthless. Consider moves in the variation.

As a rule of thumb, whenever White tries to kill a small group of your stones, consider sacrificing it in the first place. Sacrifice those stones, that does not cut anything, that does not give you profit and that are not necessary for your large groups to live.]
;W[lf];B[mg]C[[SadSido\]

Another worthless save. These stones do nothing at this moment, so just abandon them. Better protect at N11.]
;W[mi];B[le];W[ne];B[lc];W[lh];B[li];W[lg];B[mj];W[mh]
(;B[nj]C[[SadSido\]

When you have two cutting points and you have to choose one to protect, choose the point which will make both groups stonger. Now you choose between M10 and O10. Protecting O10 leaves 5-stone group and a lonely stone. Protecting M10 leaves two 3-stone groups. So, I would choose M10 (see variation)...]
;W[lj];B[ki];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml];B[ll];W[kq]C[Here i realized I should probably have played in the J, K, L area erlier..

[SadSido\]

Exactly. It is important to make moves, that are profitable both for you and your opponent. If you play this move first, you 1) take your profit and 2) leave your opponent without it. Twice as cool!

Now, White has left you without your profit...]
(;B[mq]C[[SadSido\]

Bad. You are about to divide a bottom side with White and you waste a move, killing a lonely White stone. You should instead prevent White from taking territory on the bottom side. See variation...]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[lo];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[lr]
(;B[mr]C[[SadSido\]

No. Once again, your group is weak. Protect a cutting point first (variation)...]

;W[jn];B[mn];W[jm];B[mm];W[jk]
(;B[nl]C[[SadSido\]

Better to kill at L10, I think.];W[jj];B[kj];W[iq]
(;B[ks]C[[SadSido\]

As long as you have 3 liberties against 2, better resist at J2. Once again, it is possible to sacrifice these stones and play a bigger move, say, on the upper side.]
;W[ir];B[ls];W[ic]C[[SadSido\]

A painfull move for Black. Now Black will struggle for life on the upper side, while White willl take his territory.]
;B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[jc]
(;B[ka]C[[SadSido\]

This move lets White seal you on the side. See variation for an idea of more agressive resistance...]
(;W[na]C[[SadSido\]

White wastes a move. As long as he cannot kill Black now, better to seal him off (see variation)...]
;B[la];W[ha];B[ia]
(;W[je]C[[SadSido\]

White leaves a cutting point behind. I'd prefer to protect with H15 (variation)...]
;B[jd];W[id];B[kd];W[ke];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[ie]
(;B[gd]C[[SadSido\]

Black should secure his pair of stones with a cut (now, they really worth saving), then invade into White moyo (see variation)]
;W[fb];B[fc];W[gb];B[eb]C[Well, abviously i've lost my grip on focusing on trying to keep my shapes thick and strong. Instead I'm trying to kill this white g18 group, but something goes wrong... How could I've managed to either succeed with it, or at least not loose so much while trying?

[SadSido\]

Once again, the key to success is not to attack while you are weak yourself. Taking profit on move 182 (variation), then trying to reduce White territory is ok.]

;B[dg];W[cg];B[cf];W[bf]

I'm looking forward to see what you have to say about the game!

[SadSido\]

It was an interesting game to study, both players making mistakes here and there. Working at such games is a real way to improve your Go skills, because these games show your weak points, thus showing you where to pay attention. Let's sum up these weak points:

- desire to kill invading stones. No need to kill invaders directly, especially in the beginning of the game. Instead, try to seal them in the corners, small and weak, and build a strong group instead. Such groups will help you to get territory later in the game;

- attacking while being weak yourself. When you chase your opponent, ask yourself "isn't it that ladder, that does not work?" If so, go back and reinforce your stones before you continue chasing;

- making moves, that serve no purpose. Avoid moves that have no value, instead try to find moves that serve many goals at a time;

- making small moves. These moves tries to kill some lonely stones, or to save the stones that can be easily sacrificed. Before making a move, that targets a small group, think whether there is a bigger move on the board.

Work at these points (and other points as well), and, I hope, your game will improve soon! Enjoy the game!

In my opinion, if the player realizes his error before you answer his move, it is perfectly ok to let him undo. There won't be much fun in the game, if you win it because of your opponent's misclick.

On the other hand, if your opponent does not let you undo, you can't blame him. Just be careful and turn on "make move on double-click only" in your go program =)]
