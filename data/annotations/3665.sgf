C[hi! thanks a lot for taking a look at my game.  this was a close match that I felt pretty good about at the outset, but got slowly hemmed in.  I have a lot of trouble dealing with enemy moyos, and while I tried to stay close and engage all his groups, he ended up with a very large framework in the upper left that I simply couldn't match.
I would really appreciate some advice, especailly regarding erasing territory and maintaining sente durring the middle game.  his constant attack kept me from really expanding as I would have liked.
thanks again!
~clayton];B[pd];W[pq];B[dp]C[I like the diagonal opening, as it makes for a livlier game with less building and more conflict. however, it didn't help much here, as by the middle game the lines were pretty much drawn... oh well.

Well, with large moyos there is often plenty of conflict as well. With a diagonal opening it is particularly important to make sure your groups work together, and you didnt succeed in that.]
;W[dd];B[qo];W[mq]C[A bit conservative.]
(;B[ql]C[A bit conservative.];W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[Cautious again. You could have squeezed closer, thus preventing white from jumping out, which is what he should have done.]

(;W[qc]C[I wasn't sure on this move which way to send him. i felt it would build more strength and potential territory to build the wall facing my right side position, but this allows him to build influence near his other corner....

You did the right thing: build the wall facing your strong side. Sure he is going to get something out of it, but that is part of the game. As long as you end up with more points, or, in the short term, with a better position.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]C[necessary?  the loss of sente was frustrating.

Necessary. You now have a nice bit of teritory on the right side, and he needs to make another move. You retain sente.]
;W[nc]C[Now, you could have opted to expand your moyo. Without an extra stone on the right, that white stone can get annoying.

Alternatively, build from your bottom left corner. You seem too eager to avoid large frameworks, even if they are your own.]

(;B[fc];W[cf];B[ic]SQ[nc]C[Now, that top group is stuck between whites corner and the strong white stone on O17]
;W[cn];B[gq]C[im pretty happy so far.  influence in each quadrent, no weak groups.  however, I get a bit greedy here and lose some influence...]
;W[cp]C[how to respond to this move?

I think you made the right choice.];B[cq];W[dj]C[I KNOW this is too big.  that jump is cuttable.  my execution is lacking, however...

Whites thinking is correct: sure it is cuttable, it is not real territory, but it is risky to invade, and he will make a profit there.]
;B[dl];W[cl]SQ[dm]
(;B[ck]C[This is probably your mistake. Invading was necessary, but you could have opted to build a wall, keeping white low.]
;W[dk];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm]C[berzerker!];W[dm]C[berzerker!];B[dn]
C[berzerker!];W[el];B[bn]C[I wasn't sure about this result.  the cut lived, but to what purpose? he has an even stronger position with moyo potential at the cost of only a few points.]
;W[kh]C[??  not sure how to deal with this.

Not a bad move by white; he knows he has good centre influence on the left, and this strikes the middle between that and his lone stone on the right.]

(;B[og]C[make sure that little guy doesn't get away, I guess...probably too small, though.

Not good shape. Q14 would really remove the threat of R14, and N15 would be a better attack.]
;W[qp];B[jq]C[You make a lot of these two point jumps, and while they are safe, remember they are quite small in terms of points. Q5 is potentially bigger.]
;W[po];B[ro]C[perhapse I should not have ignored that.  inflence in the center continues to wane, and these stones get killed later.  is the aji all that bad or was I right to grab the big point?

It was not that big, and this is not good shape. R6 is better.]
;W[db]
(;B[lc]C[mm tasty side territory

It is more important as a move that puts pressure on L12. This territory is weak on the left, because of D18. And now that you have P13, there is all the more reason to attack the centre white stone.]
;W[hh]C[confused me at first, but in hindsight this looks bad for me.  potential for territory on either side and with all the settle stones I gave him on the left, his center seems too strong to touch...]
;B[em];W[dl];B[fm]C[this feels a little better, but I'm unsure how to continue.  the moyo is still there, plus he has three corners pretty securely.  with those two stones in the center, is there anything I can do to turn this around?

In any case, do a count: in terms of territory, you are ahead at this point. The left bottom corner is getting big, and there is still potential on the right.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[ec];B[fd];W[nb]
(;B[mb];W[hl]C[looking worse by the second...from here on out he pretty much keeps sente and pounds on me...]
;B[in];W[ef];B[gf];W[kr];B[jr];W[kq];B[lf];W[kk]
(;B[md]C[i was happy about this exchange, though maybe not rightfully so.  I figured I could pull quite a few points out of that middle section if I stayed connected. perhaps, though, it wasn't big enough?]
;W[rp]C[trouble, though I don't see it coming.

Here you see why S5 was bad shape.];B[nl];W[fg]
(;B[gg]C[i think this is unncessary wall building, and just gives him strength.  but where should I attack?]
;W[gh];B[jg];W[pn]C[very bad.  at the best, bad shape, though I do much worse.  how can I get out of this unscathed?

I think this is good move by white. The best answer is probably R7]

(;B[so]C[hmm, maybe this will work... ;P I was afraid of the s6 invasion, and thought this would make sure he couldn't connect underneath.]
;W[jh];B[ig];W[jp];B[ip];W[js];B[is]
(;W[ks]C[these seemed like endagame moves, but is ther any way I could avoid playing them through? if ignored they would get worse, right?

This is the endgame, and white chose the right time to play them. Note that he missed an opportunity.]
;B[ir];W[mh]C[noooo! I REALLY wanted n11.];B[ni];W[fl];B[gm]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[gl];B[en]C[grr stuck in gote!  meanwhile he secures his lead.

Still the fallout of that dubious manoeuvre early on.];W[kn]
C[GOT to invade.];B[mn];W[no]
(;B[nn]C[kinda weak... I felt like I could have done more, but how?

At this point, you can still win a lot of points by playing a clever and precise endgame. O6 does not do anything, white does not really have to react to it.]
;W[rm]C[uh oh.];B[qm];W[qn];B[rl];W[sm];B[sl]C[damage control was the best I could come up with.  was there anything better?

No.];W[sp];B[pm]C[smaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllll

And gote.];W[nh];B[oh];W[am];B[co];W[ga];B[ha];W[fa];B[hc]C[those darn sente point grabbing sequences... I must have lost twenty points that way.

And you could have won as many by playing them yourself.];W[mo]

I hope my commentary will be of use. It was a nice experience for me too, it s a good way to learn, for both of us.

(;B[gk]C[This erases a bit of his potential territory, builds your own, and it threatens the two white stones in the middle. The top can take care of itself, although it is not very secure. But you have to take some risks.

In general, try to get a more fluid perspective on territory. It is not something you stake out at the beginning and then defend for dear life the rest of the game. Think more in terms of potential, of giving away a bit and getting more in return, of actually inviting (unprofitable) invasions, in order to build up outside strength, etcetera. For instance, at this point in the game, notice the two white stones are surrounded on three sides by your own. That means you can get profit by attacking them, even if you lose a bit at the top.]
