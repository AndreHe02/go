C[Human strength is 9 Kyu.  Computer playing at level 5

phi: hi. My strength is 10 Kyu (european countin) I hope I still can give you some comments.
I made some variations (normally you will find them atached to the previous move.]
;B[ee]LB[gd:A][gc:B][fd:C]C[phi: Tengen is a good start on a 9x9 board. I personally prefer one of A, B or C.]

;AB[hd]C[phi: something was wrong with the file: here: black plays two moves after each other.
by the way: black H6 is a bad move: It generates an "empty triangle" at G5.]
;W[hc];B[ie]LB[ef:A][if:B]C[Should have attacked at g7? Or g8?

phi: At G7. J5 has not much  potential: It is one point in gote. Worse: It leaves another empty triangel at J6. I you are sure, that you can ignore White H7, play at A (E4) in sente or B (J4) in gote.
On the other hand: White has no chance to connect under H5-H6.
See variation, how white could live.]
(;W[fb]
(;B[eb]LB[gc:A]C[phi: this (E8) is not stable. Better play at A (G7). See Variations how to kill white.]

(;B[gc]C[phi: I think it is stronger to push from the left (C8) see variation.]

phi: My words. See variation on Move 32. Protecting B6 you probably kill white. I don't see how white could live.]

The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 25 territory + 4 captures + 0 komi = 29
   Black = 8 territory + 1 captures = 9
White wins by 20.])
