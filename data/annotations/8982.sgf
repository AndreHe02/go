C[Hi
sorry if this review is not very good, it is the first one I am doing. I am about 11k on KGS.]

[qg][qh][pe][pf][pg][ph][of][og][oh][ng][nh][mh]C[Just a note that the first move (I know it is your opponent's) should be in the top right corner, it is a tradition.]
;W[dc];B[dq];W[pd];B[dn];W[qn]C[This move is correct for this black opening?

This move is good, it creates pressure on the black stone while creating territory on the right side. The slight problem with this move can be seen on move 8.]
;B[mq];W[qi]C[Here black has a safe territory of a side and two corners which he easily protects. White's stones are spaced out and not very safe. Move 6 could have been like this or maybe it could have been somewhere on top making white some more territory, I don't know which is better. You would have to ask a stronger player.]

;W[rp]C[Great move. It is a common mistake (I often do it  :-)  to keep extending. Making eyespace is a priority.]
;B[qb];W[jc]CR[jd]C[where this move should be done? here?

I would have probably played on the forth line (K16)  because it makes more territory than K17 on the third line.]
;B[oc];W[ne]CR[nd]C[I think O15 should have been one space higher (O16). Black would have less space to extend.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[md];W[le];B[de];W[fc]CR[dg]C[D13 would have probably been better here to gain something on the side.]

(;W[pl]CR[fi]MA[fj][ek][dj][cj]C[this move strengthens black pieces (move 75 in q9 breaking the connection possibility white)

This move does not do much for white. Black still manages to connect. F11 would have been good. Black would escape but white builds a solid wall. The way you played black makes a lot of territory by killing the G9 G10 group. See variation]

G14 is good.];B[kb];W[ic];B[ki]CR[gh]C[I think G12 would have decreased black territory more than defence around L11, by saveing the G9 G10 group.]

;B[fh];W[np];B[nq];W[oq];B[mp];W[no];B[cc];W[cb]CR[dd]C[D16 would have been better. Black could not extend upwords because of the cut and white has a more stable position.]

(;W[il]C[Here white should save K10 L10 group by playing L9. If white would have played like this, the whole white group would be saved. See variation]
;B[kk];W[gl];B[fn];W[gn];B[fo]C[I think white's resignation is a bit early. Black can kill the white group around G7 easily, but could also make a mistake and let it live. Because nobody's play is perfect, I would try extending and attempting to kill J6 or F7 black group before resigning.]
