AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Generally, black's moves reflect solid ideas. Black's troubles come largely from difficulty deciding when to fight stubbornly, and when to protect.  When responding to deep invasions, think less about trying to kill and more about how to make profit while attacking. Often, when an opponent invades too deeply, you can play a calm move that strengthens your position and gains points, while leaving your opponent with weaknesses he has to fix. In other words, often the best "punishment" for an overplay is indirect.]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[dg]
(;B[hd]C[W3 is unusual. Black should attach immediately to c17, securing a base and taking the corner. See variation. 

After black at h16, there are two stones on the 4th line. This shape isn't always "bad" (there is a common, though older, variation of the Chinese opening in which white plays two 4th-line stones), but it leaves the stones "floating" without a base. (See variation for Chinese opening example, for reference).]

(;W[gc]LB[hc:B][gd:A]C[This is indeed an annoying move. As mentioned, the high position of black's stones are a problem. I would still call this an overplay by white, but it is probably a good move in a handicap game to create complications.

Black has two obvious moves to consider: A and B.  Connecting with A seems passive, but isn't terrible. Black should get sente, and his stones around G16 will reduce white's influence on the left. But blocking at B is the move with "fighting spirit." I wont' lie, it will probably get complicated and I can't attempt to read out the variations, but I've included some possibilities.]

(;B[gd];W[fc]LB[hc:A]C[Here, I think black should block at A immediately.]
;B[fd]LB[ib:B][hc:C][ic:A]C[As white, I'd come out at A, B, or C, which would keep black's stones floating. I can't argue too much with the game move though.]
;W[ec]
(;B[hc]C[Good idea (though, as I mentioned, I'd push at D16 first).]
;W[dd]C[W has to fix.];B[pj]LB[mc:B][nc:A][fg:C]C[I can't argue with this move. I also thought about A, B, and C. (C is probably not great right now, on second thought, as it doesn't really pressure white).]
;W[kd]C[After L16, black has a few things to consider. First, how weak is the H16 group? (I think this group's potential weakness was the reason for the game move). Second, where is black's potential territory? Ideally, you want to profit from attacking white, though you don't want to die in the process :).  

I suppose black should also ask "can I kill white?" But in situations like this, the answer is almost always "probably not." Unless there is no other chance to win the game, you generally shouldn't build strategies that require you to kill (at least not in situations as open as this).

Black's largest potential is on the top and right.  The H16 group should be strong enough so that black can play from the other side and build territory, and then strengthen H16 as necessary. Some ideas in variations.]

(;B[je]C[I wont' say this move is "bad," but contact moves (and diagonal moves like this) tend to strengthen your opponent. Here, black risks white building strength facing black's potential territory, reducing black's potential.]
;W[ke]
(;B[jg]LB[jf:B][kf:A]C[Black may be trying to move fast, but A and B are stronger moves. This moves leaves a weakness--it is a small weakness, but enough for white to get a move almost for free.

As I mentioned earlier, black's potential territory is on the right side, but after this move, black can't change directions and must keep up the attack (which is why I don't suggest moves on the right side).]
;W[kf];B[jf]LB[hg:A]C[A is an idea to consider instead of K14, though I'm not sure it is better.]
;W[pf];B[nd]C[Good response i think.];W[oc]LB[nc:C][pc:A][od:B]
C[Here's another peep that you said was annoying, and I agree. But this one is easier to handle than the last. There are 3 options--I like A the best, because it secures a base and some points in the corner, and white is left uncomfortable. See variations.]

(;B[cl]LB[lg:A]TR[cd][dd][dg]C[I understand wanting to pincer so white doesn't get comfortable on the left with a lot of points, but the marked stones make this pincer difficult. Since black has some support around K13, maybe a high pincer is a little better.

Also, black has to watch the H16 group. If white can build strength attacking the C8 stone, the H16 group could come under attack, although black can connect at A.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[hq]C[This is a fairly common move in handicap games.]

(;B[jq]LB[co:B][go:A]C[I like the idea of this response, and it is probably better than G3 (a common mistake). But here, I like A and maybe B. I think this also shows why C8 perhaps wasn't a very good choice.]

It is just an example of when two stones on the 4th line can be okay--the idea is to reduce black's potential on the right side. One of the reasons this isn't as popular today is because white's high stones can create problems later, and they don't secure any real points.]

Compare this to the most common 3-4 point joseki (see next diagram). Black can extend 4 spaces (because the stones at E17 are stronger), white's corner is smaller, and white's position is lower on the left. The joseki is considered about even. This is much better for black.

 There are other possible variations, but black should get a nice extension like this on the top, or set up an attack on the D13 stone.]
