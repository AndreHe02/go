C[Dear Jonathan,

You made some very good strategic decisions during the game: deciding to give up the three stones on the right, and choosing to "give in" to the invasion at the top. The main errors were not jumping out with the weak group on the right, and then the ko in the lower right. After the ko started, the game was probably unwinnable for you.

Hope the comments will be of help.

All the best,
Thorstein]

;B[np]LB[qq:A]C[** Fine move. Since the bottom is not interesting (black's J3 is low and solid)
black should go for the right side and/or thickness. a) could also have been a
good point for black here.];W[qo];B[pp]LB[qp:A][qn:B]C[** Good. Black also has a) or b) here, but the played move looks best.]

white does have the weakness at a). However, black should try

(;B[gd];W[ie]LB[gf:A]C[** Black could also come out at a), although it will almost certainly lead

white capture a stone in this way is normally too generous. But in
the present overall position, black's final result seems ok.]
