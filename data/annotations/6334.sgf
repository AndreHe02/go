AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Blue: Hi Reviewer, thanks for the review. This game against a player 5 ranks above me went really badly because, currently and in all games, I fail to adequately defend my territory/make it into really mine. Whether this is due to the setting up where I don't sketch out my territory properly, or whether I can't defend against attacks.

Also I had a lot of endgame problems, where places I thought were secure turned out not to be. I'd like you to see whether this was bad defending or just that the positions were weak is for you to find out.

Although I've asked for specific topics here and through the game, feel free to comment on anything you see.

Thanks,
Alexander.];W[qf];B[nc]LB[nd:a]C[Reviewer:  I would rather see O16 then O17.  When I look a the board I see 5 black stones and 1 white stone.  White has approached at R14 and is affecting 3 stones.  Q16, K10, and Q4, QK10 the least and Q16 the most.  Q4 use to have a connection to Q16 and now it doesn't.  K10's connection to Q16 is weakened.  Q16 used to have a connection to Q4 and now it doesn't and the connection to K10 is weakened.  Q16 has the added benefit of being able to live on the side or in the corner.

So how do we decide what to do?  Clearly we need to help Q16 it is the weakest stone on the board.  An observation I have made in games is that no matter what  the strength of the players-- the one with the least number of connected groups on the board wins.  Rarely do I see anything other than that.   Re-enforcing that concept is that fact that the player with the least number of connected groups has been the most efficient at living.

Let's look at what white is doing.  R14 is cutting Q16 off from Q4 and weakening the connection to K10.

O16 strengthens the connection to K10 better than O17.

More on this concept as I review.];W[qn]C[Reviewer:  R6 weakens the connection of Q4 to K10 and makes a weak connection to R14.  This connection is weakened by K10.]

(;B[nq]LB[np:a][qj:b]C[Reviewer:  I would rather see O4 as this re-enforces Q4 connection to K10 better thatn O3

If Black plays at R10, then white has two groups on the board, while Black still has 1 connected group.  See variation]
;W[oj]C[Blue: I've seen this a lot in handicaps but Q10 is usual. Is P10 valid or can I take advantage of it?

Reviewer: This move is consistent.  Yes Q10 is usual, but this is a weaker version with the same idea.

P10 interfers with K10's influence on the R6 and R14 stones.  If Black was at O16 and O4, White would be in severe trouble playing a move like this.  There seem to be no stones interfering with Whites connection, so yes white can play this way.]
;B[pl]C[Reviewer: Good move -- Seperate White into groups];W[ql]
C[Reviewer -- Attach to stones makes them stronger as well as your own, if you don't care if they get stronger then attach, otherwise don't touch.   White should have gone P6 to intimidate Black and give the illusion that black is being seperated.]

(;B[pn]C[Reviewer this allows white to connect his groups]
(;W[pm];B[om];W[qm];B[pk]C[Blue: Here I'm fighting, but I'm not entirely sure what for. To separate P10, possibly, but also to keep an inroad to the side to reduce his territory. Neither succeeded and in hindsight neither was a particularly good goal. What should I have been doing?

Reviewer this is an asking move. -- Push him into the corner or outside your choice.  the outside is more valuable right now]

Reviewer Final note:  It takes 6 stones to live in the corner, 8 stones to live on the side, and 10 to live in the middle.  Keep white out of the corners -- it takes him more moves to live.  Cut white into more than one group -- it takes even more stones to live.  In a handicap game you are connected so only one group needs to live and then connect the rest while keeping white cut apart.  The game will naturally turn into a win.

Good luck.])

;W[oj]C[Reviewer: Black is now disconnected.   Black must have a goal.  Seperate white's stones so he has to live in two places.  This could be that we connect our stones out or we have to live behind his lines.  I perfer connecting out.]
