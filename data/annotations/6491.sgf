C[L.S. i played this game on KGS against Yohsan as black. We play often and we're quite equal in strength. I'm 9k, he's 10k. I lose as often as i win from him. Where are my keypoints for improving?

Furthermore, the game is not really interesting, it's mainly pushing, squeezing and closing up. Still i'm curious what could make a difference, for example in taking big points on the board or reducing my opponents territory more.

Thank you for taking the time to review,

pim, the Netherlands
