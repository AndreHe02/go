C[gyusanya [22k\]: hi

Hello, I am Eric. And I will be reviewing your game.

I think the biggest thing you should work on is not getting too greedy when surrounding your moyo. it is better to play 1 or 2 spaces back in security than to get broken into and captured.]
;B[qp]C[Jeromin [21k?\]: Hi gyusanya
Jeromin [23k\]: I am jeromin, playing white. I was reasonably satisfied with the control of the game up to the point where black broke through low right first and middle left immediately afterward. I still could have won, Had I not been careless in the end gam with my left corner.
Jeromin [23k\]: Any comments greatly appreciated];W[cd];B[pc]
;W[cp];B[dj]C[Jeromin [23k\]: First corners, then sides, so I decided not to worry

if you care to know, though it is higher level than probably you need to worry about right now, but blacks move here is too high since your corner stones are on the 3rd line. he should have played at c10.]
;W[fq];B[dn]C[and again his extension is too high and too far, you could have played d8 here effectively, however it would be messy and maybe too messy for you to do effectivly at your level right now.]
;W[fc];B[dg];W[jd];B[lc];W[jp];B[lp];W[qi]C[Jeromin [23k\]: seemed good time for jumping in]
;B[qg];W[ql];B[qm];W[rm];B[qn];W[oh];B[pg];W[mh];B[pl];W[qk]
;B[rn]
(;W[sl]C[this move seems small and gives your opponent sente, you are already connected to the outside. maybe O14 instead. Though you would have to be carfull in how you respond if black cut at q12.]
;B[nf];W[kg];B[le];W[jf]C[see, all you got was connect, where black makes territory]

;W[bq]
(;B[lo];W[kn];B[ko];W[jo]
(;B[eo]C[again, black could have played better here as well, see variation]
;W[fo]C[Jeromin [23k\]: so far I was happy with development of W stones although B has two big corners I don't know how to invade...]
;B[em]C[you should have started trying to reduce black here.]

(;W[fm]C[this seems uneccessary and weak.]
(;B[cf];W[be];B[ce];W[ee]C[This is weak, see variation for how black could have exploited, you should have reinforced maybe at c17 or possibly b16]

(;B[sf];W[qf]C[Jeromin [23k\]: this was an experiment, I knew it wasn't goo but figured I could afford losisng a few points...]

(;W[ph]C[this is not very neccessary.];B[lg]
(;W[kh];B[lh];W[li];B[kd];W[je];B[mg]C[You should have played o12 here, see variation for why. It leads to a small reduction. well, never mind, I don't think there is much of an invasion for black, but O13 is weak shape, and the resulting black attempt that could have come from it is messy and you could have slipped up in a unneccessary weak shape.]

(;W[al];B[ak];W[an];B[bj]
(;W[ag]C[Jeromin [23k\]: up to here i was happy with sente in the end game, but this corner was too vulnerable

Here, you cannot push in because black still could take the corner by playing c17 and then c18. b18 for you would secure your corner]
;B[bh];W[ah]C[this really gives black more stones];B[ai];W[af]
;B[dh]C[Black finally stopped the reduction I talked about]
;W[bd]C[b15 was already to weak to save though b18 woul dhave saved your c16 group]

(;W[ca];B[bc]C[Jeromin [23k\]: any way out of this?];W[ac];B[ad]
;W[ae];B[ad]C[Jeromin [21k?\]: well done
Jeromin [23k\]: thanks

I think your biggest problem, is that when you are protecting your own moyo's, you play move that are too weak because you are trying to make it bigger by one or two points. make sure your walls are secure even at the cost of 1 or two points, because the 1 or two points you might get are not worth having something captured or broken into. You should try to learn to recognize stronger shapes and keep an eye on the number of liberties of your groups. I would recommend going onto www.goproblems.com and doing some of the lower level tenuki problems.]
