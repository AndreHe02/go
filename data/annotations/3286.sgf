AB[pd][dp]C[I made two very bad mistakes in this game, at moves 80 and 178, as commented. However, this is not my main concern - I think my weakness is in a poor sense of direction, particularly in the late stages of the fuseki.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[hq]C[Very good move. Threatens Whites base while expanding Blacks own position.]
;W[pr]LB[qk:C][no:A][qq:B]C[The usual reinforment is White A. Since B and C are some kInd of miai, Black could also invade as in the variation.]

(;B[qq]C[This is a good move too.];W[no];B[pk];W[qf];B[qh]C[Good. Black builds a solid formation on the right side.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[qj]C[Overplay.];B[pi]C[White gets two weak groups and Black none. Even if the white groups will live, Black  gets thickness and territory by attacking them.]

(;B[rh]LB[ph:A]C[This is a bad mistake. As a result both sides get weak groups. The most natural move is A, which is correct. (See var.)]

;B[kh]C[Very good. This ponnuki radiates all over the board and repairs the defects in Blacks shape. Black has the upper hand.]
;W[nk]LB[md:B][qr:A]C[This is a very strong move. It makes White A an uncomfortable move for Black. But Blacks ponnuki is still better. Even so I would like to see White play at B instead, which is sente against the upper right.]

MM: Somewhat small but not a very bad mistake. For making territory in the left F10 is better than F8. Cutting off E8 with white D9 doesn't work (see later var).]
