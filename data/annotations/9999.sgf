C[Hello SpiderJ,

I'm Grimaldi ~10k, I'll review your game (for black)];B[jd]
;W[dj];B[dd];W[jj]LB[kh:A][hk:B][kk:C]TR[dj]C[Usual approaches to the 3–3 are at A, B or C. If you’ve not yet used it, have a look at josekipedia.com.

B does not feel "good" because of the stone marked with a triangle. A seems natural but might be a bit slow on 13x13. C will usually result in a living corner and white will develop a wall (see variation)]

(;B[ji]C[SpiderJ said: I think that the moment I started this fight i started to lose.

Not necessarily. You made an error in move 11. If you did see the ladder, this would have been ok (see there)]
N[I think that the moment I started this fight i started to lose]
;W[ki];B[kh];W[jh];B[ii];W[kj]TR[jh]C[You can capture the marked stone, see variation.]

[dh][fi][fj][fk]C[SpiderJ: Maybe this stone here didn't hekp me so much later. Should I have put it near G4?

White does not need to respond to your  move and plays elsewhere. That means you loose the initiative. This is called a "gote" move.

In addition this stone is too near to your strength, that means the wall. 

You have exchanged a center facing wall, for approximately 15 points in the corner (see triangles). While this territory is safe for white, you'll need to turn your center influence into profit. So you need to put pressure on white. 

You can achieve this by playing at the positions marked with Xs.]
;W[kd]LB[kc:A]C[What is your objective here? 
Separate the white stones and create a weak group, so that white struggles to make it live. This is not so easy, because there are only two spaces between the played stone and the strong white group.

The other possible objective is to get a (large) share of the top right corner, by playing at A]

(;B[lb];W[hc];B[ib]LB[dc:A][ch:B][fj:C]C[Well, normally your moves 39-49 would be wasted: If white does not make errors, you'll loose those stones, because you can't make them live.

A-C are good alternatives or see alternatives before.];W[hb]

;B[hk]TR[ga]MA[db][ec][fd]C[SpiderJ Said: This fight was pointless to me, resulting in isolated stones

Were you trying to contain white or did you want to kill the white group? Killing would not work, because white would have made one eye and then win the capturing race in the top right (see variation on move 54, the marked stone being white's critical move). For containing, see variations on 36.

Your battle in the top left corner was ineffective because your stones did not work together and left weakness after weakness. You played at the crossed positions and lost each one. Instead you could have built a base following move 50 (see there)]

;W[ef];B[cf];W[ce];B[gf];W[hg];B[hf]C[SpiderJ: I think I was fine there

Well yes, your center group lives. But at what cost? Left hand side is approximately 3x13=39 and bottom right is ~16 -> 55. You got ~10.]
;W[fa]
(;B[hh]C[This move gives up the initiative, i.e. it is a gote move. Instead play sente moves, moves which keep the initiative.]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[gm]C[SpiderJ: I wonder if there could have been some way to get to the bottom (Is that named escape in this case?)

Well, sometimes you want to separate two groups. This is done by playing at the marked stone, see variation on 87

An "escape" is necessary, if your group can't live alone and you want to connect to another group to make them live together. But as your center group lives, you don't need to do that.]
;B[he];W[cg];B[ie];W[md];B[ge]C[SpiderJ: At his moment I realized I could claim that group

Ehm, no.]

[gj][hj]C[How to improve your play:

- check out "sente" and "gote" on sense is.xmp.net. Especially in the opening practice playing sente moves. 
- during play take your time and count. So that you know, when to take it easy and when to fight fiercely.
- it always helps to practice life and death problems.

Have fun, Grimaldi]V[-47.5])
