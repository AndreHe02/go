C[Dear reviewer,
I was white in this game and I had no control over it. I thought my opponent was overplaying a lot, but I failed to punish him and he got away with everything. In the end I had to resign.
I went over this game and I could not find what exactly I was doing wrong. So that's why I am asking for a review. Thanks.



Hi Twold,

in a short sumary you lost the game in the lower right corner with the bad moves s5 s3 and especially t4. Your opponent was able to gain 2 moves here and that is why he pulled ahead.

Remarkably I wonder why you think you did not punish the overplays.
A overplay of you opponent can turn out nice for you, even if you canot capture something.
This ist the most important general point you need to understand to improove.]

You are right in assuming that you could have punished b harder for his overplays. But in general you made usefull moves and overplays cannot win over usefull moves. White has a lot of potential near A to make up for the secure points b has.]

(;W[ro]C[I dont like this move even if it threatens to kill black.
Whenever you play a move like this, make sure it does kill. If you only get a ko here, it is better to play tenuki to begin with. If you are not sure if it kills, play tenuki too.

However this is not the loosing move.];B[pj]C[As always, he takes the biggest point and ignores all my moves. But here S5 doesn't kill, so I should have played here first.

Even if you can kill now, you have gained about 30 points in two moves (s5 and s2 for killing make 21 points +9 points lost by black). Each move was worth 15 points. This is big but black can probably still tenuki, finding other moves near that value.]

Please, help me find an answer, so that I can improve.

There is no need to change your style. Just take big points bevore small endgame and play shape points instead of meaningless conections.
Apart from that the key to getting shodan is practicing live and death.

have fun with the review and with playing go!
I hope I was able to help a little. Feel free to ask questions about the review.]
