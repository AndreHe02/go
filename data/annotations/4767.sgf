C[*X*: Hi, Ismael.  If what you say in your comments is correct and you lost because of underplay and lack of direction of play, I should be able to help you.  I think direction of play is the strong side of my game, whereas I find it much harder to review games with wild fighting.  I will prefix my comments with *X*, for "Xopods," my KGS/IGS username.

The above paragraph was written before I reviewed the game.  Now I'm writing afterwards, and I'd just like to say that you have one critical weakness in your game.  You like to play a thick game, but you don't use your thickness correctly.  Most players try to kill more often than they should, but that doesn't mean you should never try to kill.  There is a certain commitment involved in making thickness - if your opponent invades two lines in front of a ten stone wall, you need to put your money where your mouth is and KILL HIM.  If he plays that unreasonably and you're content just to take third line territory in front of your wall, then all the moves you spent to build it are rendered completely meaningless.  

When you build that wall, you are issuing a decree about the area in front of it.  "Play here and die."  A reasonable opponent will obey that rule and so the wall's value is implicit.  If an unreasonable opponent insists on ignoring your "NO TRESPASSING" signs, you need to have the courage to get out the shotgun and enforce your own rules. If he's too dumb to respect the implicit value of your thickness, then by all means, make it explicit.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[kc]C[*X*: Very good so far.  I like the mini-Chinese formation a lot.]
;W[ec];B[fd]C[*X*: Say "thank you" to White for this exchange.  This clearly helps Black.]
;W[od]LB[ec:A][fc:B]C[I found this w move too greedy but the stones is very light in the following sequence...

*X*: I'd agree that it's too early for this invasion.  Especially after exchanging A for B, White can't hope to get a counterattack on your stones on the upper side, and you will take territory on the right, which is the essential purpose of Chinese-type formations: territory on the top if White reduces, territory on the right if she invades.]
;B[pc]TR[od]C[*X*: I agree with this move, but I like White's tenuki.  Now the marked stone looks more like kikashi than a premature invasion.  Still, I think Black is better.]
;W[id]LB[ke:A]C[*X*: I think A is the only move here.  If you provoke a running fight, you will swallow up the marked stone in a natural way.  See variation.]

(;B[ic];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[gc];B[ge];W[fb];B[fe];W[ib]
;B[jc]C[*X*: This is, of course, a good result for Black too.]
;W[jb]C[*X*: Endgame move.];B[pk]C[*X*: Very good.  I'm glad you didn't waste a move blocking at L18.  Of course, now you're looking to play P17 if White doesn't.  As well as taking territory, it would pretty much connect up with L17 and form a wall all the way from R16 to F15.]
;W[kb];B[lc]C[*X*: Wow.  White really wants to help you win this game.  Say "thank you" again.]
;W[me]TR[id]C[*X*: So, now we see White's plan.  Give you enormous thickness, then try to live in front of it.  The key for you now is not to try to attack too severely, since that will give White chances to dodge or make an exchange.  The presence of all your thickness nearby is severe enough.  Just attack on a large scale and make the whole right side of the board your territory.  Watch out for the aji of the marked stone, though.]

(;B[je]LB[lf:A]C[*X*: Too slow.  You can remove the aji from the stone while attacking, for instance at A.]

;W[nb];B[mc];W[ma];B[of];W[pf];B[ne]C[*X*: Cutting off one stone is small, since your group above is already thick.  You should just be treating P14 like the kikashi it was and leaving it alone for now.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[og];B[nd]C[*X*: See, you ended up making P14 heavy by adding O15, so now you let White move into the centre in sente.]
;W[mg];B[oe];W[pe];B[qg]C[*X*: Bad move.  The other peep at P11 is likely to be more severe later on if you leave this unplayed, since it would cut with atari.]
;W[pg];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]C[*X*: Why not just invade the corner?  White won't be able to make a moyo on either side, due to the low stone at Q3 and your thickness above.]
;W[dn];B[ip];W[iq]C[I am quite happy to play this joseki here because of my Q9 extension

*X*: I'm not sure this is good.  This joseki makes aims at a centre-oriented game... unfortunately, your move at O15 sort of killed that possibility.  You should always try to find ways to make your previous bad moves look good, rather than making them look worse.  Now O15 is looking like the game losing move.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[op];W[pm]
C[Here I hesitated. on the direction to attack.

*X*: I hate White's play this game... the whole "give the opponent massive thickness, then invade right in front of it" strategy is just hoping that he doesn't know how to attack.]

(;B[nm]LB[nl:B][ol:A]C[Actually I had no idea what the goal of my attack is: just make him suffer. This is my problem currently, I attack weak group without seeing the possible benefit and I make mistake in the choice of direction...

*X*: With this move, you're attacking from your thickness, rather than TOWARDS it.  You're forcing him through the gap at A, which is not what you want.  You should play at B and crush him against your wall.  He will die almost certainly.

This is really a crucial point - you can't just assume that a cap is the correct way to attack every time.   You have to think about where your thickness is and how to push the opponent into it, rather than away from it.]
;W[ol];B[nj]C[*X*: This is good style, at least.  White should still suffer, but it's much harder to kill now.]
;W[nl]
(;B[lm]C[*X*: Wrong direction, again!  Push White TOWARDS your wall.]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[ml]
(;B[qn]C[*X*: What is this?  You're worried about 15 points of territory at this crucial stage?  Or you want to live in the corner or what?  Don't forget that you're supposed to be attacking!]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[nn]
(;B[qm]C[*X*: I think that White is sufficiently surrounded that your first priority should be denying eyes.  If not, you should be atttempting to deny escape routes.  Taking third line territory is not enough at this point.]

C[Here also I am unsure of the direction of the attack.

(;B[ie]TR[id][if]C[*X*: No, no, no.  You can't win at Go by answering every supposed "forcing move" your opponent makes.  Why prevent the two marked stones from connecting when you can easily swallow them both?]

Your best bet is to attach at J11 and hope that the ensuing mini-fight results in the loss of the eye at F8.  Then you might be able to kill.  Only if White makes a blunder, of course, but why draw his attention to his weakness before at least giving him a chance to screw up?]

[ro][er][ds][es]C[*X*: This game was close only because you made it that way.  White gave you many chances to turn it into a massacre, but you were too scared of making a mistake and answered submissively again and again.  That's a sure way of losing by a small margin.

It's rare, when I write a review, that I find myself saying "KILL, KILL, KILL" instead of advising a more subtle approach... but in this game, there were clearly a lot of White stones that could and should have died without compensation.  Give in to the dark side once in a while... nurture your killer instinct.  Yes, it's poor style to try to win every game by killing a large group... but when your enemy puts his neck on the chopping block and hands you an axe, it's equally poor style to pass up the opportunity.

Aside from that lack of murderousness, your biggest problem is that you play a thick game, but don't understand thickness.  What makes thickness valuable is that it is STRONG.  If a wall or a group is truly thick, that means it doesn't need reinforcement.  EVER.  And that means that any move by you that comes from the direction of that thickness is redundant and bad.  You should always come from the other direction in order to push your opponent against it.  If you do need to reinforce it, then it wasn't thick to begin with - it was heavy.  Moves like that cap at O7 and connecting to the peep at J15 are examples of how you make thickness and then waste moves by playing near it.

Put another way, the virtue of thickness is that you've invested moves early on so that you don't have to later.  You can chase the opponent in that direction because you've ALREADY cut off that escape route.  Playing another move to block off that direction renders the original decision to make thickness completely meaningless.]
