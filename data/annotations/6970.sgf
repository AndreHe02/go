;B[qd]C[Hello!

My name is Ádám Bencsik (Tommyclaw on KGS).My rank is 14k, and i played this game against a 13k player, with 0.5 points komi.

tsjanl: Hi, my name is Jan-Willem Swane (nick: tsjanl). My rank is 7k NL. 

I concentrate my review on general concepts, not on a lot of variations. There is always a difficult step when you are at your strength from fighting locally to viewing the whole board situation. I hope my comments will offer you a help in developing into that direction.

The review ends at move 103. Enjoy.];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd]
(;B[oc]TR[ed]C[tsjanl: This is a bit slow to my taste. 

I would like to play at the marked spot (see variation).];W[qj]

(;B[qh]C[tsjanl: I do like an approach from the bottom better, because the top is more secure. You play towards your strenght (see variation).]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[tsjanl: With this move, you are giving a perfect formation (a three point jump from a two stone wall).]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[jq]C[tsjanl: Because white already had the perfect placed stone on R10, he has the possibility to play on this nice point.]
;B[cq]TR[ed]C[Is it okay to do a 3-3 invasion now?Because...

tsjanl: No, I don't like this invastion. It gives white the possibility to build a wall that works perfect wiht the stone on k4. I would still prefer a play on the marked spot.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm]
(;B[bm]TR[dr]C[In general it's considered bad to create territory on the second line, because the opponent gets too much in return (a strong wall). Usual is the variation that starts at the marked spot.]
;W[cl]C[...this way white has a wall on both sides.

tsjanl: Black has helped whtie to form a huge amount of influence, that works good with the other stones on the bottom.]

(;B[oi]TR[ed]C[tsjanl: With the move you play, you are pushing from your strong group on a strong group of white. In general that is not really urgent. The big move is still at the marked spot.]
;W[jc]C[tsjanl:This really hurts black. Compare the influence of the move you played (and white didn't have to answer) with the move white plays.]
;B[ed]C[tsjanl: This move has lost a lot of influence now that white has a stone at k17.]
;W[cf];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[bb];B[hc]C[tsjanl: Black rather would like to extend to j17, but k17 prefends that. Besides h17 induces a move that white already would like to play...]

[sb][pc][qc][rc][sc][an][ao][ap][bp][rp][sp][aq][bq][qq][rq]
[sq][or][pr][qr][rr][sr][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[tsjanl: It's advisable to pause a few times during the game and evaluate the whole board situation. Now that the opening is finished, this is a good moment. Good things to look at are territory, influence and weak groups.

Black has more territory than white (compare the squares and triangles.

On the other hand, white has a lot more influence than black, especially in the lower half of the board. If white can get a stone on b8, he will get a lot stronger on the left half. My evaluation is that white's strength at this moment easily compensates for his lagging behind in territory.

The groups I marked with a circle are weak. The black group in the upper left is especially weak, because white has a stone on the second line (b18), that can rip the black group of a base. The two white groups are weak because there are black groups nearby.

What are black's possibilties now? I think the best thing to do in the long run is trying to prevent white forming a big moyo in the lower half. Good spots for that ar A and B.

But before that there are two things urgent. Firstly, he has to make his weak group more secure. And secondly he has to create more strength in the center, so that A and B will have more chance on success.

I would start with a move at C. This move has three purposes (the more purposes a move has, the better it is in general): making his group stronger, attacking white's weak group and getting more influence in the center.

Another good point to look out for is D. It's is threathening the other white weak group, while getting more influence on the outside. I'll come to that later.

A possible continuation is in the variation.]
(;B[nd]C[tsjanl: I like this less than a play on J15. You are driving white's weak group in the direction of your weak group and that is dangerous.]

(;W[md]
(;B[de]C[tsjanl: this is a move that strengthens white more than it strengthens you. These kinds of moves are called 'thank you moves, because you are inviting white to play at a spot where he would like to play anyhow.]
;W[lq]
(;B[ql]C[tsjanl: You should only play this move if you have a reasonable cerainty you can kill white. Otherwise you are strengthening white. And by that, you are weakening your corner.


Locally I would like a move at q9. See variation.];W[pk];B[rn]
;W[rm];B[qm]C[tsjanl: This doesn't work, as you have noticed. You are inviting white to get into your corner.]
;W[ro]C[Tsjanl: ouch.];B[rp];W[sn]
(;B[pl]C[tsjanl: You better leave the two stones now and defend your corner.]
;W[ol];B[qk];W[pj];B[rj];W[ri]C[tsjanl: You are strengthening white.]

(;W[rj];B[nl];W[om];B[mk];W[he];B[mj];W[nm]C[tsjanl: You are lucky: white should start harrassing your group at the top.]
;B[ml];W[or]C[tsjanl: But now you pay for strengthening the white group at the right.]
;B[nr];W[oq];B[op];W[pp];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[rq]C[tsjanl: Thsi doesn't work. You better leave the three stones on the board as ko threaths.]
;W[qr];B[os]C[Is there a way to save all the stones in the corner?]
;W[rr];B[qs]C[tsjanl: idem.];W[sq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[ks];B[mq]
;W[lp]C[tsjanl: Do you see how first strengthening white group at the right forces you to defend your corner, which helped white to turn his moyo into territory? White has gained a lot since we evaluated the position.]

(;B[ce]C[tsjanl: This doesn't work. The important part of the board is the lower half.]
;W[be];B[df];W[cg];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[hf];W[jf];B[gf]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[jl]C[tsjanl: I think this move wins the game.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[gk]C[I wanted to reduce white's moyo, but i was not sure how to do it.

tsjanl: You waited too long. In general, you played too much for territory and had not enough eye for forming strength aimed at the center. When you manage to play a more balanced game, your play will become much stronger.

Here I do end my comments. I hope they are helpfull for you.]
