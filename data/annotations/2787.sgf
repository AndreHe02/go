C[Hello, sorry for the delay :)) 

Well I am Rogerio (rogluz) and will be your reviewer for the evening. Sorry but I do not speak any french :)) 

What I will do is give some opinions on your game, since I am only 6k most of them will be of some help to you, but do not take them as dogmas. 

OK? So Let´s Go! 

Any time you see a "R>" it will be me :) 

Have fun

&Hi,

&My name is Stephane I'm french and live in Tahiti :-D
&Thanks you for taking some of your time to comment my game.

-16
-20
-70 to 84
-140

Thanks again

Stephane

&PS : don't take care about the '&' I put before all my sentences. I use it to reconize my sentences after the game was commented]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[nq];W[ci];B[ce];W[df]C[&This one : it is good ?
& I was trying 2 things :
& 1. press black along the edge to build outside strenght
& 2. Kill it if black make a mistake

& It this a good idear or not ?


R> The ideas are good, but since it is too early in the game, trying to kill might not be best awnser. 

And it you wanted the outside maybe D14 was not the best play. You should consider: D15, E15... other good moves here are C16 that gets you the corner (the help of the stone at C11 is enormous in putting pressure on these black stones then)]
;B[cc];W[de];B[cd];W[dd]C[& I thought a lot about this one.
& I feel that's it is bad because to slow, but can't think of a better move, so I played it

R> Well it was what you wanted wasn´t it? To confine black and get a huge outer influence? Because it is just what you got :) This is not bad, but the sente is black now... and he is not yet 100% alive...]
;B[db];W[eb];B[da];W[ea]LB[fc:a]C[& This one was bad -> F17 is enough
& Are u agree ?


R> Yes but in any way you lose the sente..];B[cb];W[fc]C[& at last ;-)]
;B[qj];W[nc]C[& about this one
& is it the good direction ?

&One should not use thickness to build territory, but in this case, I think it a good idear : begin to build la large moyo, so black will invade, so I will be able to chass him

&It is good ?

R> Yes building the big moyo on the top is good now... making the stones at  the top left come into play nicely. You could have played O16 too]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[nf]
(;W[oc]C[& too slow ;-(
&see variation

R> Variation seems good, but N14 has become a gigantic point for both players... when there is a point like that sometimes it is better to get it and then think what to do next... they call it a "moyo turning point" and whoever gets it has the advantage on that part of the board.]

;W[dg];B[ch];W[eh];B[cg];W[cf];B[bf]C[R> D11 has becomed a very big point now... whoever gets it can make claim of the left side... so D11 is a huge point, and now after you killed the invading stone it is what you need to win the game.]
;W[be]C[&Stupid, I kown, there was very little chance black miss it :-(
&So I should had keep it for a Ko thread

R> Yes... D11 is best];B[bg]
(;W[fq]C[& This one : what do u think about ?

& I sacrifice sente to secure the corner
& Look soft no ?


&I thought about L3 but I was afraid of black pincer (see variation)

R> L3 is a bit far... K3 would be a very good extension. D11 still is VERY big.]
;B[jq]C[& Good for black]
(;W[lq]C[& up to 81

&I suspect this one to be very bad :especially when u see what happen next !

& My frist idear was to separate black and take the edge and black stone N°71

R> Well your stone at M3 only serves to make the territory for black at the right side become a lot bigger... you managed to save the game but this was a awfull play by white. as soon as black can get the D11 stone he can invade at 3x3 at the bottom left (yes he can still gain something there) and take away your side... if he can take away your left side and make a big right side he can think on coming back to the game :)]

C[R> Both players made lots of mistakes, but white won because he played better on the early stages... killiing the invasion early is a BIG advantage. White must learn to play ahead... wasting moves that can be made later, thus missing big points expecially the "moyo turning points" is a very easy way to let a opponent come back into the game. 

Greed and over extensions when winning by more than 20 points after fuseki is a VERY BIG DEFECT. And white must study how to take the most advantage settling the stones peacefully and losing the least possible. Winning by 0.5 is as good as winning by 100. 

Well any future questions will be happily awnsered. 

Hope you enjoyed the review.
