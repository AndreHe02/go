KM[0.5];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[jd]C[w K16 is somewhat unusual.  w cannot compete by building  his own moyo  here]
;B[pj];W[jj]C[w K10 also unusual.  sides have priority over the center.   K10 does  nothing for w's moyo.]
;B[dj]C[the game already looks hard for w.  he has no  choice but to invade the  b moyo]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[hq]C[b H3 a little too close to W.  H3 will get  used by W to gain strength  here.  I would play D6  instead.]
;W[hp];B[ip]C[B J4 is wrong.  H3 is the stone that needs help here,  not K4. J3 is  correct for b.]
;W[do];B[co];W[dn];B[cn];W[ep];B[dq];W[go];B[ho]C[b H5 atari  gains nothing.  W can ignore.  B D7 looks much more  interesting here.]

;W[jn]C[w K6 is wrong.  the w F3 group doesn't need help, the O3  group does.   the way to punish is to  surround him.  I think b M6 would kill w.  see the variation.]

(;B[qg]C[b R13 is small  and unimportant.  the w O3 group is still very weak.  I  would attack it at M9.]
;W[lk]C[w wastes no time playing M9 himself.];B[cg]C[standard approach is C14.  but the urgent matter is the b K4 group.   It is surrounded and  does not have 2 eyes yet.  Another reason why b M9 would have been a good  move.  b must  try to make life now.  probably starting at G2.]
;W[pl];B[ql]C[b R8 will  definitly end in gote for b as he must connect at Q7 and R9.   better to play  P9 here to connect solidly and let w play gote to save Q8 later.]

(;W[pk];B[ok]C[b R9 looks better here];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[nk]C[the cut at P10 could  be serious for b later.]
;W[pm];B[rj]C[B P11 fixes the cut and the problems  along the edge, so is better than  S10.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[jm];B[mk];W[ll];B[lj]C[b M10 looks dubious here.  it ends  in gote and does't help b or hurt  w.  the b K4 group is  still in big trouble.]
