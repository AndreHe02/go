C[Ok Olaf, I will try to do my best to review this.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[cn];W[fp];B[dk]LB[dj:a]C[Since white 6 is high and doesn't secure a base, black is not that weak and generally 7 should be at A.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc]
(;B[pc]LB[jd:a][qd:b]C[I think 11 is the worng direction since black doesn't have any stone around K16 (A).  Black should split white at B.

The disadvantage of splitting is that D16(3) is not used to it's full potential then (see variation)]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og]LB[jc:a]C[As I said before here black ends in gote an white can invade directly around k17(A) then switch to the left side]
;W[ic]C[So he did];B[gc];W[lc];B[pb];W[qb];B[qn]LB[ce:a]C[I think that the left side is more important, A seems like a good spot.  It protects the corner and helps the 2 black stones (perfect extension from 5-7 with 5 spaces)]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[ql];W[np];B[ce]C[Good, but the bottom seems bigger. After what happened when you approached at 21, I feel like you should invade now before it becomes too big]
;W[pf];B[of];W[ne];B[oe];W[di];B[cj];W[cf];B[df];W[cg];B[ci]
;W[dg];B[bp]LB[ef:a]C[This move is not urgent, you should keep putting the pressure on white at A for example.  A is the kind of splitting move that keeps the pressure on white and indirectly aims at attacking the top group (16-18)]
;W[ie]C[Now white is safe everywhere];B[ge];W[ec]LB[ef:a]C[white too greedy here, black A is still the right answer]
;B[dc];W[gb];B[fb];W[hb];B[fc];W[ef];B[de];W[fh];B[nh]C[53 is the kind of move you should avoid, it doesn't increase much territory and can't aim at attacking the top either.  Invading the bottom is still urgent]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[fq];B[ho];W[jo];B[gn];W[dm];B[cm]LB[dn:a]C[Too timid, you should split at A.  The rule is : " if white is greedy and overplays, put the pressure"]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[en];B[fl]C[Good move, seal white in and  link up]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dj];B[ck];W[bo];B[co];W[bq];B[cp];W[cq];B[dn]
;W[fn];B[em];W[gr];B[hr];W[ip];B[gq];W[fr];B[hg]LB[gm:a]C[good move to split the 2 white groups but none of them is really weak. Protecting a cut at A is urgent, your connection is very thin there]

[lp:d][nm:e]C[This cut is not important to protect, you might consider pushing along with A to develop the center, white B, black C white D black E]

C[Not a bad game from your part but you should

 1) COnsider the urgent points 1st
 2) Play the big points to consolidate your territories instead of invading your ennemy territory
 3) Reevaluate the board every 10 moves or so ( or less if you feel courageous to see where the big points are)
 4) Don't be too afraid of stronger opponents, still put the pressure on them.  Even if you loose because you made a miscalculation, you will learnmore than playing too passively

Congratulations - GriGri])
