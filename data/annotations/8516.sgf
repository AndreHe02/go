C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS. I will start my comments with W.

Let's have a look. : )];B[pd]
(;W[cp];B[pp];W[dd]C[W: According to a professional (possibly Takeyama, can't remember), this position is bad for White.]
;B[ep]C[I play a high approach most of the time. I don't really understand the difference between the low and high approach. What I know is that a high approach usually gives influence and a low approach is more territory oriented.

W: To punish white for his mistake, black plays here.

Low- and high approaches depend on if you want influence/fight (high) or if you want to take territory (low) or if you are in danger and need a base (low)]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]TR[ep][pp][fq]C[W: At this moment the Black stones at the bottom work well together. Compare with variation.]
(;W[dn]
(;B[jp]C[For the same reason to play E4 I played K4 to obtain some influence. Would it be better to play a low extension since I have a high position in the lower right corner already?

W: I am very used to playing this move, high moves in the opening are usually "better", because if you worry too much about territory and low moves, you might find yourself at a disadvantage when the middle game fighting takes place.

However, according to Guo Juan 5-dan professional, the marked stone protects the three stones in the lower left corner, but bottom right corner is now too open.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]TR[pp]C[W: This move is usually played when White has a stone in the opposing corner, and Black has to be afraid of another approach move.]
;W[jd]
(;B[ci]LB[cf:A]C[It is hard for me to decide whether to play a splitting move or to directly kakari the corner. What aspects should I consider to make my decision.

W: I like this splitting play. Had you played A instead, White would surely get what White wants.

The timing is perfect, White wants to play around D10 to create a double-wing.]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fc]
(;B[np];W[qk]C[W: Push against STRENGTH.

Black top right is WEAK.

Black bottom right is STRONG.]
(;B[qm]C[W: Also, I dislike moves such as this, because Black has played 3 moves in bottom right corner, and White can still make a living group there in sente.]
;W[qh]
(;B[pb]LB[ld:A][md:B][og:D][ol:C]C[I saw this move in many tutorial videos. Actually most of my opponents play nobi at Q17 instead of jumping to Q18. What is the difference?

W: It is about efficiency of your stones. This is the proper move here.

I wanted to make the corner safe, so I can build influence at around A later to prepare for an attacking move at C. I also considered to keima at D instead of making the corner safe. What is your opinion about where Black should play move 25?

W: Because Black pushed White towards the weak corner, it feels like a good plan to defend at Q18.

Instead of attacking from R7, I would've attacked from R11 instead.

Black ended up defending, when he was the one attacking. Did everything go as planned?]
(;W[qq]C[W: This is a White mistake. Invading when you have a weak group nearby is an overplay.

By strenghtening Black's position here, White's right side group becomes a lot weaker.]
;B[pq]C[W: Absolutely the correct direction to block from. This way Black makes as much territory as possible.]
(;W[pr];B[or]
(;W[qr]
(;B[qp]C[W: Instead of letting White live with this move, could you have been able to kill White?]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[sq]
(;B[so];W[rs]
(;B[rj]LB[ld:B][ol:A]C[I wanted to play around B and then come to A. But I couldn't find a way to play like this. So I just attacked with S10 to find out what white wants.]
;W[qj];B[ri];W[qi];B[rh];W[ol];B[ld]C[M16 follows the same idea as before to build up strength which should support the later fight on the right side.

W: Black only got a couple of points on the right side, even though he removed the white eye space. These moves are probably played too early.]
;W[ne]TR[qh]C[W: This move was not possible before, but now that White has been made "stronger" on the right side, White feels he can connect his stones.

White's objective is to connect these stones.

Black's objective is to not let these stones connect.]
(;B[jc];W[ic];B[kc];W[hd];B[lf];W[me];B[le];W[ng]C[W: White is very happy to connect his stones. Now it's Black who's under attack instead of White.]

;W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[mm];B[hm]C[W: Black drove White into Black territory. This is something that should not happen, unless you're 100% you're going to kill the white group. Otherwise all you do is lose territory.]
