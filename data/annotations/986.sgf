C[TH: This is my last round game from this year's London Open.   Black makes a blunder in the joseki in the top left corner (black 11). A fact which I knew, and also I had seen one of Christian's earlier games in the tournament being discussed by Matthew Macfaddyen (6 dan) so I felt that I should be able to get a good result.
Up to black 23 I think that things are going well for me, but then something goes wrong.
I guess that part of the problem is that it is the last round of the tournament and so I am tired and not thinking straight. For example it has only just occured to me that white's stones 12, 16 and 18 have now served their purpose and should be given up. Anyway, all comments gratefully received.

;W[cd];B[fd]LB[eb:b]C[11 may be a playable move but the usual one (Joseki move) is at "b".]
;W[ec]C[A variaton for Black is to play "b" for influence. This is playable for black]

(;B[eb]C[If black is going to play 13, 11 was clearly nor good. What about the cut]
;W[dd];B[db];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bc];W[bd];B[ac]C[This sequence was good for White.]
;W[ad]C[22 is too early. Even sente moves must be kept in reserve for a future use but it is a very small mistake.]
;B[ba]LB[cj:b][ef:c]C[A pincer at "b" seems good too. What about "c" which looks like one vital point in this shape]
;W[ge];B[ef];W[ci];B[cl];W[ei];B[dh];W[di];B[gf]LB[fg:b]C[May be better at "b", forcing "a" then play tobi in the center]
;W[fe];B[hg];W[gh];B[ff];W[dl]LB[he:b]C[This move is wrong as it let black have the move at "b", which is almost sente. I would play at "b" which keeps black weak.]
;B[dm];W[em]C[The cut at 39 for Black is not good but, with this move he could take sente and play on the upper side.]
;B[el];W[dk];B[cm];W[fm];B[he];W[gd];B[hh];W[pj]LB[jd:b]C[Wrong. You should play at "b"]
;B[fk]C[It is not a good idea to try to save the black stone.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[fl];B[hk];W[fj]LB[gl:a]C[better to connect at "a"]
;B[gl];W[ek];B[gk]LB[ic:b]C[This connexion is too solid. I would play at "b"]
;W[gi]LB[fp:b]C[May be getting out with "b" is better];B[hi]
;W[ij];B[jk];W[dn]LB[jc:b][fp:c]C[60 and 62 are not very big moves. I would like to play at "b" or "c"]
;B[cn];W[do];B[dp];W[fo];B[hd];W[hc];B[ic];W[bg];B[bf];W[dg]
C[Good tesuji.];B[df];W[ch];B[eg];W[af]C[With this moves White connected his 2 groups. Then it is clear that 60 and 62 were not in a big area.]
;B[qf];W[qh]LB[nc:a]C[Better to play at a which reduces the power of the back stones in the center.]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[mc];W[pf];B[qe]LB[qd:b]C[this black 81 is an overplay. Blocking at "b" is the proper answer for White. 81 could be played at the san-san.]

(;W[pe];B[qg];W[pg];B[qd];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb]LB[rb:a]C[this 88 could be played as a double hane at "a". Remember the double hane can help you to take sente in such cases.]
;B[rb];W[oc]LB[kc:b][nq:c]C[this 90 is gote. What about playing directly at "b" or "c"]
;B[rh];W[qi]LB[kc:b]C[92 is too small. this time "b" seems tome the better]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qk];W[qj];B[qm]LB[md:b]C[Very bad. Should be played at "b"]
;W[qo];B[ol];W[md]LB[kc:b]C[Why do you help black to connect his stones. White still had the invasion at "b"]
;B[lc];W[jq]LB[ml:b]C[I would attack the weak black stones at "b" in order to build some territory in the bottom right side.]
;B[nq]LB[ml:b]C[With one very weak group on the right side, black is going to have problems invading like this.
Black also should play at "b"];W[np];B[oq];W[pq]C[Good];B[mp]
;W[op]LB[no:b][mq:c]C[If White extends at "b", it helps White to play a double attack. White wants to take two stones with a cut at "c" but this threat is too small.]
;B[hq]C[Black is optimistic];W[mo]LB[ml:b]C[this move seems to help black. I would like to attack directly at "b" the black weak stones.]
;B[lp]
(;W[jo]LB[lr:b]C[Before playing 12, what about playing in sente at "b"]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[kn];W[fq]LB[ip:a]C[This seems to be an overplay. May be playing at "a" is good enough]
;B[ip];W[co];B[bo];W[bp]LB[ep:b]C[playing directly at "b" is better]
;B[bq];W[ep];B[jp]C[When Black captures this stone, White is sad.]
;W[ml]LB[mk:b]C[May be playing at "b" is better];B[nk];W[mk]
;B[nj];W[mj]LB[li:b]C[better to chase quickly with a keima at "b"]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[mi];W[li];B[mh];W[if]LB[lh:a]C[pushing at "a" was good enough.]
;B[lh];W[hr]LB[hf:b]C[No. You should cut at "b" which is clearly sente]
;B[ir];W[gr];B[iq]LB[ld:b][hf:c]C[this move is small . Black can play at "b" to be prepared to the cut at "c"]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[bn];B[ap];W[ck];B[bm];W[bl];B[an];W[hf]C[Good]
;B[id];W[kf];B[gg];W[ib];B[jb];W[pr]LB[hb:b]C[White should go on on the top with "b"]

;B[nl];W[lm]LB[ki:a]C[66 is may be too lukewarm. What about playing "a"]
;B[ki];W[si];B[rg];W[rn];B[jg]LB[jf:b]C[Better to connect the two stones at "b"]
;W[ke];B[ld];W[od];B[jf];W[je];B[jc]LB[hb:b]C[Better to take one stone at "b"]
;W[ie];B[sk];W[nb];B[mb];W[ob];B[hb];W[ng]C[Record ends here.   White later resigns due to a blunder, but was probably loosing anyway. However there is still a lots of endgame to be played, which I felt justified playing on.
J.H :  True, but it seems that black is ahead by 5 or 10 points (according he must give back the komi)]
