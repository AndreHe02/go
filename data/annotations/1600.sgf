AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Looking at the ranks, I don't think I'm that much
stronger than the black player in this game, so I hope that you can reply
to point out some of my own mistakes in my comments!];W[cf]
;B[cj]C[With a
stone around K16, I would definitely pincer here, but without that stone I
might prefer to answer at F16.  Still this is a fine
move.];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[db]
;B[gc];W[fb];B[hd]C[This move is probably a mistake (should be
at C17).  You need to make a wall to use your C10
stone.];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bg];B[cc]C[does not work]
;W[bd];B[gb]C[this move is bad :(

Yes, but even without this move, is the exchange here good for you?  I
don't think so.  Your stone at C10 is not working well.  White has taken a
LOT of territory and black has not gotten much outside strength at all.
Playing Q10 instead of G18 would make it a little better, but you still
need to play G15 to finish the ladder, so it's really not good for black
here.];W[pn];B[ge];W[np]C[This double approach is very severe against
black's corner.  You're already starting to fall behind.  The thickness in
the top is now pretty good, but you had to play two extra moves to get it
while white got to play two moves in the bottom right
corner.];B[oo];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[no];W[mp];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp]
;W[op];B[po];W[fq];B[fo]C[I like this idea;
let white take the bottom and get strong over the rest of the board.  Later
D13 might press white down and make a big center for you.  In the short run
M6 is a very big move and so is Q10.];W[ip];B[er]C[This is small.  M6 or Q10 are bigger.]
;W[fr]C[White answers anyway.
If I were white I would probably have ignored it to play R14.  But then
white is probably a stronger player than I am....]
(;B[qi]C[maybe too low ?

Yes, definitely too low.  Look at F5, and the thickness in the top left,
and the bottom right ... you need to think on a big scale.]
;W[oi]C[which
direction should i choose to answer this capping move ?

If you answer at Q13, white has an easy R17 invasion.  Q9 is probably good,
because it also helps prevernt white from doing anything with the Q6 stone.
P12 and even N11 are also worth considering...]
(;B[pg]C[The wrong side.  White's corner invasion is too easy
now.];W[qc]C[yes, white could play Q17, but R17 is easy and good enough for
white.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]C[with Q13 on the board, perhaps you can play R14
instead to contain white and get sente?];W[re];B[rf]C[Does the double hane
use the Q13 stone?  Maybe R14 and then S13 makes that stone work
better?];W[pb];B[ob];W[oc];B[qb];W[pe];B[od]C[yes, white could atari once more at P15 before
connecting.  That looks like a better plan for white.  The thickness in the
top left is more neutralized that way.  Black should not have played the
double hane.]
(;W[qf];B[oe]C[This is an excellent point for black to take, using the Q13
stone and the thickness in the top left.  White should have played
here.];W[rb];B[qg];W[qa];B[nc]C[Black ends in gote but gets both sides
while white has a smallish corner.  Black got better than he deserved here.
If white had poked his head out at P15, black would be in trouble in this
game.];W[mo]C[This looks slow, why didn't white play M6?];B[mn]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml];W[lj]C[A nice move to pull out the P11 stone and try to make
shape in black's big moyo.];B[ll]C[A nice solid answer, separating white's
group.];W[lh]
(;B[jm]C[to slow is nt it ?
I dont know where to play here.

Neither do I.  You want to attack white on a large scale to make use of
your thickness.  Does this move have a threat?  Not really, since you can't
play at M5.  Look for ways to attack white's shape and take profit at the
same time.  P9 leaves a bad hole in your shape.  M14 is like a kind of
capping move.

The problem with your move is that the groups there are already strong.  So
you need to either play a move that attacks white more directly or a move
that defends your weaknesses on the left side.  E10 might be
interesting.];W[cn]C[my hope was to build a wall in this fight.

But it's too late for that.  White's group floating in the center can live,
so what can you do with your wall?  The real problem here is that you made
thickness but then didn't have much of a target for attack.  White's center
group of three stones is too resilient.  Still you have to try to attack it
somehow...];B[cp];W[cl]
(;B[ck]C[a bad move :(

Yes, enclosing is better.  You usually can't attack with a contact move;
the move just helps your opponent make
shape.];W[el];B[fk];W[gm];B[gl];W[fl];B[ek]C[another one

I'm not sure.  This might be necessary since white is so solid above...
white playing here could be bad.  Still probably G9 is better.

Is the K7 stone useful in this fight?  If not, it's in the wrong place for
sure.];W[hl];B[gk];W[eo];B[ep]C[Who is under attack now?  It looks like your corner group is
getting as weak as white's group above it.  Your stones at C10 are getting
half-surrounded too.  A move at E13 might make you start worrying about
those stones.  This game looks over.];W[fp];B[en];W[fn];B[go]
C[This move
doesn't work, it looks like you're just giving white a gift (is your
corner really going to live!?)];W[do];B[dl];W[dm];B[hm];W[dk]
;B[dj];W[hn];B[im];W[ho];B[bn];W[bm];B[co];W[dn];B[ko]C[White has gained a
lot on the left side, so you can take the small stones here (in gote,
too!)];W[kp];B[lp]C[ah, but you try to take more than just the two stones.  That looks
too greedy.];W[lo];B[jp];W[kq];B[io];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[jo]
;W[kr]C[A nice
reduction of white's territory in sente (I thought it looked greedy, but
you had read it out better than I did).  Though perhaps the H8 stone will
cause problems later.  Your stones here have only four liberties... but
probably can connect to  M8 or capture H8, so they're probably OK.]
;B[ki]C[Attacking white here is your only chance in this
game.];W[li];B[lf]C[This is a good way to start the
attack.];W[ok];B[pj];W[oj];B[om]C[Can you afford the time for this solid
defensive move?  Hm, probably, because it also gains you some points on the
right side.];W[kj];B[ji];W[kl];B[km]C[Now all of those stones may be in trouble.  They don't have a lot
of liberties...];W[jj];B[ik];W[jl];B[il]C[White gets some free moves while
you save your stones, but it doesn't give white an eye, so that's
fine.];W[ii];B[ij]C[playing this side lets white capture your two stones,
which looks like it should end the game.  My count says white has about 70
points, and black about the same... so the four-stone difference of
strength can show itself in the endgame.];W[ih];B[jg];W[jh]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[nh];W[oh];B[ng];W[og];B[of];W[mk];B[ni];W[pk]
;B[qk];W[fi];B[gi];W[gh]C[Yes, I like your idea at H11 better, but reading
out this kind of situation is not my strong point...]
(;B[fh];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[ej]C[Now black's big group
has only one eye in the center!?]
(;B[dh]C[black saves four stones on the side but...];W[hp]C[now the whole
center group only lives in ko!];B[dl];W[ql];B[pl]C[This kind of ko threat
looks good for black.  Black gains points on this exchange, I think.]
;W[dk];B[in];W[kn];B[dl];W[rk]C[....but it does generate a lot of
follow-up ko threats here.];B[qj];W[dk];B[jk];W[kk];B[dl];W[ol]
;B[pm];W[dk];B[gn];W[gp];B[dl];W[nm];B[dk]C[White gets unconditional life out of this ko threat,
plus a big gain on the right side, so the game is over
now.];W[on];B[qm];W[qn];B[rm];W[nn];B[rn];W[nl];B[sr];W[qr]
;B[bl]C[This is the wrong direction, since your corner group is
still weak.  Connect at B5 instead.  Even the hane at F19 is bigger for
you.];W[bo];B[bp];W[an]C[This exchange (which black started with B8) is a
big gain for white.];B[eq]C[Is this the right shape?  It lets white come
in.  Is D2 or D3 better?];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr];W[hf]C[Black lost points with B8, and took gote!  Just play E3 or B5
right away, defend the weak corner group.  WIth B13 on the board there
aren't many points in the left side
anyway.];B[ie];W[rg];B[rh];W[sf];B[pf];W[if];B[jf];W[ap];B[bq]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[cb];B[cm]C[This is a very small move.];W[ga]
;B[ha];W[fa];B[hb];W[ph];B[qe]C[This is small too, since you have to win the next stag
e of ko to get any real
profit.];W[ro];B[qo];W[so];B[sn];W[rl];B[sp];W[qh]C[connecting here (R12)
would have been better than R15.  Now you are going to have to play in your
own territory to take white's stones off.];B[rj];W[sh];B[ri]
