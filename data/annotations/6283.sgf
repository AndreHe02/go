C[I'm around the 1k-2k strength on KGS, but I'm a very 
negative (Cho Chikun style) player preferring calm games 
and avoiding large-scale fights. I'm working on changing 
my style now and being defeated by a CyberORO 9k is a 
good lesson for me... :-)

Hello, your game was impressive for a person unused to 
fighting games; good for anyone.  Your only big problem is 
not reading in enough detail to see what type of aji will 
occur.  I hope my comments helped.

Also, your knowledge of go terms is impressive (thanks for 
semedori  ^_^).];B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[od];B[pf];W[qd];B[pi]
(;W[fc]C[A move I thought about too, but perhaps this is better? 
(See variation.)];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed]
;W[gb];B[ge];W[cc]C[This is an ok move, but you have to ask yourself, "Is this 
really sente?; "Does he have a move that will create bad 
aji for me?"  That move is H16.];B[hd];W[gc];B[cd];W[he];B[ie]
;W[hf];B[jd];W[gg]C[Maybe G13 would be better at J13? This is the first move 
where I hesitated for a bit.

Between the two, I believe J13 would be better, as it is 
more urgent for black.  However, it seems there might be 
something with L15, black can choose between letting 
white's corner expand out or letting white seal black's J15 
group be sealed in fairly well.];B[eg];W[ic];B[id];W[jg];B[le]
;W[lc]MA[nf]C[I guess some signs of my heavily territorial attitude still 
appear at points like this. But I also wanted to keep an 
option of attacking m15 later and so settling my outside 
group in sente. It didn't quite work out. Maybe I should 
just jump out with my white gorup around h11 to make it 
more secure, then attacking one of the two black groups 
would be miai?

A good thought; it would work pretty well.  Another move 
to consider is O14 (X).  Like your idea, this creates a miai; 
black either runs with M13 (recommended) or extends to 
Q8.];B[md];W[mc];B[nd];W[nc];B[oe];W[pd];B[fi];W[gi]C[Now I'm getting into trouble, I didn't expect b to settle his 
right group so easily in sente. I'm strenghtening black but 
my idea is that I need strength badly and b is still open on 
the side.

I agree, your idea was good, but ouch :( .  Here, I think
H11 is preferable over the tsuke because he can simply 
extend and your group is still in more trouble because it 
can't expand as easily to the center-right and his attack 
would be more severe.];B[fj]
(;W[cm]C[Should I better secure my central group? I chose the 
distant approach to prevent a pincer.

I would recommend securing your central group a little 
more, perhaps with J10 or H9.];B[em];W[cj];B[ch];W[bp];B[cq]

(;W[bi]C[I felt compelled to play this because of b6 aji. But there 
should've been a better way of establishing my group.

I agree; another move is necessary to guarantee the life 
of all your stones (without a big fight).  However, see the 
variation for a possible better move.];B[ij];W[fh];B[eh];W[gj]
;B[fg];W[gh];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl]C[Hmm... living here while not giving black more center 
influence is hard.  See variation for a possible sequence.]

;W[jh];B[ii];W[gf];B[ig];W[if];B[bh];W[hk];B[hl];W[il]C[I've misread and thought that defending either group is 
miai now. Not really.];B[kk];W[im];B[gn];W[mj];B[jl];W[ni]C[Seems too slow.  Perhaps N8, as black probably would 
need to run a little to guarantee life.  Then, maybe Q9 
afterwards.];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm];W[nk];B[pk];W[nm];B[mo];W[ql]

turned out as mostly aji keshi, right?

(;W[bn];B[el];W[dk];B[rc];W[hq]C[Desperate. Still, while there is thickness everywhere the 
area _is_ big - maybe there is some clever invasion point? 
My aim here is to have two two-space extensions as miai, 
though the extension to the l3 direction is unhappy 
because of second-line peeps; and anyway the eyespace 
it gives on its own is too small.];B[fq];W[kq];B[lo];W[gr]C[Heavy - maybe f2 would bring more hope?]
