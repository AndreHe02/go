;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[pp];W[qn];B[ro];W[dp];B[np]LB[mp:A]C[Donal: Both players are playing fine moves through White 10. Personally, I
would have played a pincer instead of black 5, but it is hard to say that 5 was a bad move.

However with 11, Black is clearly overconcentrated. Since he has such a solid formation in the corner, he should play at A, or on the left side of the board.]
;W[pj];B[qh];W[oh];B[qe];W[mn];B[de]C[The purpose of black 15 was presumably to attack White and gain a profit, but if anything it is White who seems to have profited. Black needed to find a stronger play instead of 15. (see diagram)]

(;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[Again, I would have chosen a pincer here instead of the attachment of white 18. A pincer works well with the white stone on the star point at the lower left. Black 23 erases the power of the star point.

This is largely a matter of style, but especially in this game the pincer works well with the White stones in the center. (see diagram)]

(;W[mp]C[a severe move.
maybe i should have play m4 instead of d15 ?

Donal: Of course black 11 would have been better if it was one space to the left. But at this point it is too slow to play at A (see diagram).

Also White 24 is somewhat of an overplay (see diagram).]

;W[kn];B[lo];W[ll]C[White ends in gote either way, but he now has cuts that he wouldn't have if he had played correctly.]

(;B[pa]C[maybe i should have waited to play the ko ?

Donal: Playing here now is big, but you can kill White unconditionally (see diagram).
I can't read the rest of your game record, so my comments end here.]

On the other hand, playing at B is dangerous, because you can expect a white pincer attack. I prefer a move like black 1 here, which limits White's territory without getting into trouble. Going all the way to black 5 seems natural when Black is so strong in the lower right corner. Invading at 6 and then coming out with 8 shows a good feeling for the flow of the stones. After forcing at 10 White can now play 12, but with 13 Black will get a good result.

But why play 6 first? Why not just play 8, threatening to play 6? Well, if White plays 8 first, Black might defend on the right with 12, and if White then plays 6, Black won't play 7, he will play at C. So 6 was necessary to test Black's response.]

C[Rather than take the upper left corner, White will do better by giving it up and taking the lower right and center.

See how White's stones all work perfectly together. And see how the exchange of White A for Black B now is a brilliant victory for White.

Note that White 5 is best here. Black C doesn't work because the ladder is in White's favor. (see diagram)]
