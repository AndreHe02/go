;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp]C[H: This suggests that B wants Kobayashi or Chinese as his opening.  As W I'm happy to play either way, so I'd take the last corner.]
;W[ep]TR[pd][dn]C[H: I personally don't like this way of playing for W, as I feel it's very aggressive.  As B, I'd take a lot of time to figure out what to do next, this is a very delicate moment in the game.  I'd consider the marked moves.]

(;B[eq];W[fq];B[dq]

(;W[iq]C[H: This is too narrow.  Remember, extend 3 spaces from 2 stones.  Small mistakes like this will end up costing you a lot over the course of the game.]
;B[pc]LB[pe:C][qe:B][qj:A][qn:D]C[H: B used sente well.  The left side is low, so not very interesting for either player.  Perhaps I'd prefer a hoshi stone to this komoku, but either way it works well.  In this fuseki, I already feel that B is faster.

This is a moment where W had to decide the widest area to play.  I feel it's definitely the right side, so I'd play at A, B, C, or D.]

(;W[nq]SQ[fq][iq]C[H: I see these 3 low stones, and think that the bottom is a failure for W.  It's difficult to be happy for this result, with 1 stone 4 spaces away from a VERY thick (indeed, overconcentrated) group, and the entire position feeling low.]

(;B[pq]C[H: This is overly defensive by B.];W[qn]
(;B[qo];W[pn];B[lq];W[mp]C[H: This was a good move.  B will have a hard time saving this stone.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[ip];W[jq];B[jp]TR[hq]C[H: The marked point is always playable for B.]

(;W[pf]C[H: A big area of the board, but I'd prefer playing to attack the B group and try to make some profit, still.]
;B[mc];W[mf]C[H: Here, B should see a big moyo starting to emerge, and should immediately invade.]

(;B[fc]LB[cf:A]C[H: This seems unimaginative.  At least B should play from the wider side, at A.  Overall this feels like it misses the important area of the game at this moment--the center.]
;W[cf];B[db]
(;W[cc];B[ic]LB[hp:A]SQ[db][fc][mc][pc]C[H: This B  shape is much too low.  B cannot be happy with this result.

Pay attention as W to the next area of importance: the bottom.  W should play at A and try to use an attack against B in order to make a stronger moyo.]

(;W[cj]C[H: I'm not sure I like this move.  As W, I'd attack B's lower group to make a bigger moyo.]
;B[qe]LB[qh:B][qi:A]C[H: B sees an urgent area, but A or B are still probably better.]
;W[qf];B[re];W[rf];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[ql]C[I felt at this point that I was clearly ahead in fuseki with a large mojo and a weak black group in the bottom. Would that assessment be accurate?

H: At this point, all of W's territories feel a bit cramped and inefficient.  If B secures the bottom group, this feels like a won game, to me.  I really don't like B's low top territory, or the cramped corner in the lower-right.  I feel like B has a better potential overall, as long as B can live on bottom and control the center to a degree.]

(;B[oj]TR[mf][mg][mh][mi][mj][lk][ll][lm][ln][lo]C[H: this feels a bit desperate.  I'd prefer to solidify the h4 group at h3, and create a weak W group to attack (or else take sente)

Notice the border of this moyo.  You should play on this border to avoid complications.]

H: Hard to tell what's best here.  If you can live while cutting the B invasion, then this is a success for you.  If you cannot, then it's a failure.  It's as simple as that.]

Black: 65

Is that more or less accurate?

H: This is my approximate guess as to score.
Black: 67
White: 55

I think that you might be counting some territories as bigger, or counting on unresolved areas to be profitable for you.  For example, I can't count the lower-left either way, because it's sente.  I am making the assumption that you'll capture at j12 next, for this count.]

H: Game over indeed.  This was an interesting game.  A lot of your mistakes are related to missing the important points when you needed to find the proper direction of play.  You should pay particular attention to your early and early-mid game, so you can avoid entering the fighting stage of play with an inferior position.]
