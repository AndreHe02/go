AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Llywelyn: Thank you for reviewing my game!

This game was accidentally a five stone handicap game (serves me right for not checking these things when I accept), but we decided to play it through anyways.

I won by the grace of my opponent thinking he could make something seki and moving inside of my territory when I didn't have to respond.  This lead to me winning by 0.5 moku.

Any help or advice is appreciated, particularly since this is the first time I've ever given five handicap stones.

Thanks for the opportunity.  I have made most of my comments at the beginning because I think this is generally the hardest part of the game in some ways and better play in the beginning will give you alot more to work with.  You also seem to have some good ideas about the endgame.  If you have any questions feel free to email me at  naustin@indiana.edu

;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[lq];W[nd]C[Llywelyn: I'm not really sure how to properly punish when my opponent leaves out the ikken tobi (on what is already a poor choice of responses).  It seemed better to preempt it for his broad tenuki than to do a three space extension along the bottom.  This gave me good outer influence, but ceded the entire corner to Black.

NA-To be honest with you joseki aren't my strongest suit.  From everything I've read it's best not to worry about them too much as a beginner and when you do to basically do what you did here.  Look at the situation and try to make a decision on gneral go sense.  Cutting off the corner is a good thing.  It leads to the sort of opportunities that you missed later on near the end.  Try to learn from experience what to do when a joseki is not followed and when you study joseki try to understand WHY the moves are what they are.  If you have that you will have a much clearer idea of why a deviation is bad and what to do about it.
    Also a very important point.  You must adapt your joseki to the different situations you find yourself in.  You play the exact same moves in three different corners and each time it is a worse situation to do it in.  This is a very important point to understand this game.  Look at the positions that develop in each of the corners and I think you will understand.
    Generally when white is giving handicaps one of the most important points is to avoid overconcentration.  For that reason it might be better to approach other corners and start more positions.]
;B[od];W[ne];B[nc];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[ic];W[df]C[NA-On the flip side of not getting overconcentrated one should also not purposely leave greivous weakness.  There is a big difference between playing light (making few but effective flexible moves) and leaving a position before it is done.  The cut at N16 (notice that the center handicap stone breaks a ladder on a cutting stone) and the gap at P14 seem excessive given the thickness of the position you are building.  A move like L14 or L15 might have been better.  These moves would serve both to protect  the cutting point at N16 (you would be able to capture a cutting stone in a ladder) and serve to expand your position.  It would probably be ok to head somewhere else then.
      This position also looks alittle like you are undecided about what you are doing.  You could be building a position on the right side in sente by attacking the lower right corner.
      On the other hand as I said before it is good strategy to close someone in the corner as you did.
      A big part of the opening is about just trying to establish positions that you can work from.  This feels heavy handed to me but it's definitely not a disaster either.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[ck]C[NA-This is exactly the reason why this does not seem like a good choice of moves in this corner for you.  The general rule for extensions is that the optimal distance to extend is the height of the wall plus one.  So in this case after you invest the second stone at C14 the optimal extension for you is C or D 10 but now black has played in a manner that both creates a large extension from their corner but also cramps you in.  This is optimal play for black.  In choosing your second move in this corner an extension probably would have been better this is best if you can play it in sente as an attack on blacks lower corner.  Just be careful you don't play so wide you leave yourself open to a pincer on the approach stone that threatens both it and the stones on row 14.  Playing low might have been the better bet to begin with though.]
;W[fd]C[NA-This does not seem a strong move to me on seeing it again.  Particularly in this case because this last stone is already between black ones, it is easily cut from the two white ones and you really aren't giving yourself options in terms of life.  You should probably be trying to escape or make due with the overconcentrated shape you will have to accept on the left side.  Black can easily make life by attacking the weaknesses in your two groups.]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[gd];B[gc];W[qj]C[NA-This is a good move in terms of the right side.  Extension is a good width and you threaten to attack the black lower corner.  However the upper left corner still seems quite precarious to me.  A black stone around F13 looks like it would be quite threatening.  You also have two weak groups.  The upper right and the four stones along the N and O lines at the top.  Generally it's not good to have two weak groups because the opponent can attack one to get at the other and this situation is ripe for that.]
;B[qm];W[qq]C[Llywelyn: It seemed like a good time for this with black's wings and it already being so deep that I didn't believe the thickness would matter much.  Would it have been better to wait and perhaps approach D4?


NA-Yes I think it is too early for this.  First for the reasons I was just mentioning.  Secondly I think black would be happy especially as your invasion in it's usual form is gote and he can keep you small.  The thickness black would receive seems like it could be very powerfull.  I think you probably have the right idea with wanting to attack the D4 stone.  You would probably want to keep low attacking on the third line if you did though so you could be sure to make life on the edge or in the corner.  Don't take that as gospel though.]

;B[ro];W[sq];B[so];W[mr];B[lr];W[mq];B[mp];W[qo]C[Llywelyn: I'm not clear on what I was thinking here.  Maybe hoping my opponent took a sleeping aid and that it would kick in at any moment...

NA-The idea is good.  Blacks wall has weaknesses and you are strong so attacking is good.  Perhaps O4 atari, M4 atari, L4 would have given an interesting attack.  This could work well after an approach move to D4 as black would have to choose whether to give you a good attack against the M3 stones or the corner.]
;B[po];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp]C[NA-This move is why you get into trouble down here.  It is not a good move because you do not have room and it makes you heavy.  An extension to L4 threatening a cut for example would have been sente and given you much more lattitude to manuever. After that this move might have been ideal.]
;B[hq];W[dn]C[NA-The jump to F6 would have been better as it would have threatened more.  It would threaten to escape toward the top group, to come down to the left side and maybe even to cut or make life in the center.  However this move can easily be cut by black at E5.]
;B[cn];W[fn]C[Llywelyn: I realized I was deep in B's framework without any clear support.  I needed to either find the space to make life or to run and try and connect with my northern group.]

C[NA-This sequence (the last 25 moves) had the feeling of inevitability about it.  You were lucky this whole group wasn't taken along with the entire quarter of the board.]
;B[bh];W[bf];B[hh];W[hg];B[jf];W[if]C[NA-This and your next move feel quite passive.  It's easy to see you are trying to make life but in general this is too small a space.  Playing a move like J12 is apt to do more for you as you will be threatening alot more.  You can probably capture a stone which will translate either into connecting with your right or bottom group or making an eye or both.]

;B[oa];W[ob];B[ma];W[la]C[NA-Atari at P17 would have reduced the corner considerably and probably killed it!  These are the sorts of opportunities that arise from closing a group in, which you did well.  Enjoy the fruit of your own labour!]
