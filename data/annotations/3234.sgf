C[jewel: Hello Matt


mvk: Thank you for commenting my game.  I played as white.  My post-game comments will be like this one - preceded by mvk:.  My comments during the game (minimal) are like the ones below.  I'm submitting this game for review not because I think it was particularly well played, but rather because my opponent's strategy was a bit different and I was curious about how I handled it.  I did win the game (barely) in spite of making a pretty large mistake in the lower left, but I have the feeling that like most games at my level, with a few different moves I could have won by a much larger margin.  Thanks for your help.

Solrain [16k\]: hi
Solrain [16k\]: good luck
mvk20 [16k\]: Hello!
mvk20 [16k\]: You too...];B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[qd]C[mvk: I'm not sure if there's some clearly better way to deal with two star-points.  I do have some books on the opening that I need to study, but if you have any comments that you can share, they would be welcomed

jewel: Taking the other two corners is fine];B[jd]LB[jd:A]C[jewel: I would be inclined to push A towards a corner

With both these variations the black stones are constrained while white is able to extend from one corner and close another]

(;W[oc]C[mvk: I wasn't too sure about this move, but I thought that it was never really a bad idea to enclose a corner at this point in the game.

jewel: Enclosing the corner is good, but try to achieve two aims with one move, ie find a move that is both good defense and attack at the same time.]
;B[gd];W[de]C[mvk: Again, unsure about this response.  Would a different one have been better?

jewel: enclosing the corner is good, you secure a lot of territory and can make more down the side]
;B[mc]
(;W[qj]C[mvk: I'm kind of not sure why he gave me the opportunity to do this, but I was glad he did.

jewel:you could also play something like the variations];B[pg]

(;W[qg]C[mvk: At this point I realized he would try to get some influence on the 4th line and build a wall.  I figured this was probably my best response...

jewel: not bad, but maybe an approach first is worthwhile];B[pf]
;W[qf];B[ph];W[qh]C[mvk: Should I have continued playing on the 3rd line and let him do this?

jewel: yes, you are gaining territory and building an solid shape, he will still have to turn his wall into territory.

Remember the golden rules about making territory, first play in the corners, then the sides and lastly in the center]
;B[pe]
(;W[cn]C[mvk: I thought I could defend my gap at R15, so I played here.  I was hoping to be able to take the left side.

jewel: to leave the weakness at R15 is a big failure for white]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pd]C[jewel: once your weakness has been exposed, try to mitigate the damage]

(;W[pc];B[rd];W[qc]C[mvk: Was I handling this correctly?];B[rf]
;W[rg];B[se];W[rc]C[jewel: now you have two weak groups with very little territory!]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[od];W[dj]C[mvk: Again, I thought I'd be able to defend myself in the upper right, and wanted to take this big point.

jewel: correct, but black has a lot of sente moves against your top group]

(;B[dg]
(;W[cg];B[dh];W[ch];B[df];W[cf];B[di];W[ci]C[mvk: Same as before, should I have let him do this?

jewel: same answer, you get secure territory .. however this time his moyo is starting to look strong]
;B[ee]
(;W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[eq]C[jewel: The joseki move is to atari before protecting the cut]

(;W[hq];B[fr];W[gq]C[mvk: Did I do the right thing here?];B[fo]
C[jewel: you allowed him to keep the initiative.

He not only made his corner secure, but he managed to stick his head out towards the centre too]
;W[go];B[cp];W[gm]C[mvk: I thought this was very important.  I could see he was trying to surround the middle, and knew that I needed to get in there somehow.

jewel: again E10 is crucial];B[fj];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[kp];W[kq]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[pm]
(;W[hk];B[hj];W[ik];B[ij];W[pj];B[oj];W[mn]C[mvk: I suppose I probably should have made a move like this sooner, but I was pretty happy about it when I made it.]

(;W[lm]C[mvk: I thought this was the right side to atari from because I wanted to be sure not to let those stones in the middle get any eyespace.]

(;W[jo]C[mvk: The comments below were just because of a little bit of net-lag

mvk20 [16k\]: I'm trying to move but it won't register...
mvk20 [16k\]: Sorry about that...];B[ko]C[Solrain [16k\]: no problem]
;W[kl];B[ks]
(;W[ls]C[mvk: Was this a bad move? I realize it opened me up for a Black move at O2, but figured I'd be able to take at K1 to save myself.  Bad idea?

jewel: very bad idea, this gives black a ko for life]

;B[dl]C[mvk: This was a big mistake; obviously I should have answered this move differently.  (Maybe B7?)  I did not see that I was running out of liberties here.  I make this kind of mistake about every other game.  I am improving with it, though...

jewel: these kind of mistakes can easily cost you a hard-fought game, but they become less with experience]
