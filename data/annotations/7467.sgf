AYANE: Hi!
journey: gg

Journey: Hi! Thanks for reviewing my game! I lost by a lot, so I would be thankful if you could explain black's mistakes :-)

JS: I hope I can give you some tipps to improve your game :-)]

(;B[qk]LB[qk:A][jp:B];W[jp]C[JS: Now white already is favourable becuase he has no weak groups, secure territory and central influence]

(;B[np];W[no];B[mp]LB[no:A][mp:B]C[JS: the A-B exchange strengthened the white group a little bit so white is not afraid anymore to fight with it and so he invaded the top right side]
;W[qh];B[ok];W[re]C[JS: strange move]
(;B[qe];W[rf];B[rd];W[oh]
(;B[ri];W[rh];B[qi];W[mi]LB[no:A][mp:B]C[JS: Black lost sente but somehow i dont see any way to kill the white group. So just now you should feel the increase in strength just because of the A-B exchange made some moves ago.]

;B[lc]LB[ld:A]C[J: I didn't calculate correctly, so the following sequence left me at a disadvantage...

JS: I actually think that white made a big mistake. pushing from behind on the second line could not have been what white was thinking of when he played hane at A]
;W[lb];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[kd]LB[jd:B][kd:A]C[JS: This was a bad move. Black probably got greedy wanting to kill the white group. However it is very important to really understand what it means that you only have to win by half a point. Every point more actually is just more risk. If you understand this your play will calm down when you count you are ahead, and if you really see no way in winning when playing just ordinary moves then you can start thinking doing something crazy :-)]
;W[le];B[jb];W[jc];B[ib];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pd];W[me]C[JS: This maybe was not so good timing by white]

(;B[od];W[ic]C[JS: last comment: Black lost some cutting stones and with it the game :-/. 

You probably spend much time in fuseki thinking about direction and global things, this is good, however i think you can get much better in just studiing basic shapes and reading local situations!]
;B[hc];W[je];B[pb];W[fc];B[hd];W[jd];B[df]C[J. I played the high approach, because I'm trying to build the left side and also trying to help my weak top stones]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[ce];B[dg];W[fe];B[dk];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[cp]
;W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[gg]C[J: My plan was to sacrifice my top stones for building the moyo, but in the end I couldn't gain enough points compared to white's top side. Is it better to run away with my weak stones?]
;W[hf];B[fn];W[fi];B[gf];W[ge];B[hh];W[hi]C[J: My attack on these stones wasn't fruitful, do you see a way to better use the attack?]

)
(;B[jd]C[JS: because it is probably better for black to save his important stones, however the result still favours white]
))
(;B[jd]LB[jd:B][kd:A];W[jc];B[kd];W[le];B[ic];W[jb];B[hd]C[JS: White is already alive and black has gote :-/ so this is not really satisfactory for black]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[rb];W[fc];B[ci];W[ce]C[J: Maybe this is what I should expect?]
)
(;B[jc]LB[le:A]TR[ld]C[JS: Just extending is the simplest and strongest response, black still threatens to capture the marked stone with a ladder or even in a net. If white is going to push several times on the second line to make a living, the better for you! You actually have to thank your opponent for everytime he pushes you from behind :-), just think abaout the small territory he gets when you make good thickness in the center instead.]
;W[le];B[jb];W[pb];B[qb]TR[kb][lb][ob][pb][mc][nc]C[JS: Someone once called this shape flying saucer :-) it is dead even if white plays first]
))
(;B[ln]LB[pm:A][ln:B]SQ[io][hp][jp][iq]C[J: I think the secuence in the game was a bit slow. Maybe this one is better?

JS: The problem with this move is that you cannot kill white on the right side and white has a ponnuki on the outside makeing the black stones doing nothing. Black is just trying to make somehow good shape, but doesn't increase his territory]
))
(;B[mk]LB[mh:A][mn:B]C[JS: I would just jump out making miai of A and B. The important thing is that if white lives on the right side with one of his groups he is taking the eye-space of the other :-)]
))
(;B[rd]C[JS: Probably black shuld just go down here, white has no continuation locally anyway]
))
(;B[nq]C[JS: If you still want to attack the white group in the future, you should protect your weaknesses in a way which gives your opponent no more sente moves and somehow fully finishes off your weaknesses]
))
(;B[jp]LB[qk:A][jp:B]C[J. Should have played this one first :-)

JS: This move is a must :-)];W[hr]
(;B[nq];W[pq];B[no];W[qm]C[JS: Now the black stones are overconcentrated on the bottom]
)
(;B[oq]TR[ip][jp][jq]C[JS: The way to think about the marked stones is very important. You gave your opponent a secure group and you got influence. You shouldn't use it for getting secure territory directly, but infite your opponent to fight, which however should not be good for him because its the black stones who are superior.]
)))
(;B[jq]LB[cn:A][jq:B]C[J. I didn't play this one, because I think I cant get a good position on the bottom and white can get a better position on the left. Is that right?

JS: I think both ways of playing are possible, however, I would prever protecting the cut at k3 because it doesn't allow white to settle so easy]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[hr];B[cn];W[cm];B[co];W[dm];B[oq]C[JS: I think this result is equal]
