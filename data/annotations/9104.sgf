I'm still a beginner. But I thought this was the best strategic game
I have played yet. I think the endgame was rather poor, like I threw away some points, but I would like comments especially about the soundness of the middle game strategy.

Thank you.

-----------------------------------------------
Hi Broten
My name is Uwe and i'll review your game.
You've played an interesting game and played a lot of good moves. As you mentioned you've lost some points in the endgame, but more important you can gain more in the middle game. Especially in the early state.

After reviewing your game i have a few sugguestions for your improvement.

- don't play small local moves. Search for the biggest.
- don't follow your opponent to much.

I try to show you the difference in this review and hope you find it helpful.
My comments are marked with [u\]];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp]
(;B[co]C[[u\] With a white stone on R4, i would  rather play on D5 then C5. [see variation\]]

(;W[dn]C[[u\] very strange move. But you answered well and white lost alot here.

See variations for better white moves.];B[do]C[[u\]very good!]

(;W[cn]C[[u\] And another strange move from white.
That move makes no sense. White needs to play another move to get anything and black can choose first to take the corner or the side.]

(;B[ep];W[eo]
(;B[en]C[[u\] this cut is ok, but you let white out to easy.]
;W[bo];B[fo];W[cp]C[[u\] Now white has only one strong group instead of two weak.]
;B[dp];W[cq]
(;B[eq]TR[qp]C[[u\]you try to gain influence here but with the marked white stone you can't use this influence.]
;W[gr]C[[u\]clearly an overplay]
(;B[bp]C[[u\]I see what you try to do, but this move is way to small. Thats an endgame move 

Your group is stable and G2 isn't important (because you have no territory there) so tenuki.

This is the right time to stop this local fight and think global again.]

(;W[bq]C[[u\] this move is a mistake];B[bn];W[ap];B[bm]
(;W[cl]C[[u\]as you can see, white try to rescue 2 stones, but both are not important.]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[dm]TR[op][jd]C[[u\] You get what you wanted -- 4 Points
A move on the marks is worth >25 Points

As you can see here (and later on), you answere to much to your opponents moves and fight to locally. 

Just play the big moves, especially in this early state and you will get stronger]
;W[ci];B[cg]C[[u\] very good move. Now you build territory and attack the white stone.
Thats the right way to attack!];W[bh]TR[bm][cm][dm]C[[u\] Bad move again. White need to go into the open because of the marked stones]

(;B[bk]C[[u\] An attempt to kill, but white can still get into the open.
Don't try to kill to much. Just let him live very small.

See variation.]
(;W[bl]C[[u\] white is trying to much to live here, instead he can attack you.]
;B[al];W[ck];B[el];W[bj];B[ak];W[aj];B[am]
(;W[ek]
(;B[dj]C[[u\]  another attempt to kill.

But now white can live anyway and your upper side gets weaker with every white move in this area.

Your strategy is clear, but you focus to much on local fights. 


This is the move where you need to change your way of thinking.
See the variations for a few ideas how to play.];W[cj];B[bg]
;W[fl]
(;B[em]C[[u\] Don't rescue every stone! This stone isn't important at all. Let white take it and play the big moves]
;W[ei];B[fk]C[[u\]  same as bevore, don't fight here.
You weaken your upper group and help white];W[fj];B[gk];W[di]
;B[gm]TR[er][jd][op][kq]C[[u\]  way to small. Just 2 Points!
Attack or play the big moves.];W[fc]C[[u\] good attack];B[dc]
C[[u\] good answere];W[ic]
(;B[qf]C[[u\] wrong direction. play the other side to put pressure on white]
;W[mc]
(;B[pc]TR[mc]C[[u\] to submissive. Here you try to get points. 
Attack the lower side or attack the marked stone];W[iq];B[nq]
C[[u\] to late :-)]
(;W[oq]C[[u\] to close! never attach when you attack. white should have played on the other side.

Stabilise his own group and attack yours]
(;B[kq]C[[u\] to loose. When your opponent attack like that just fight back]
;W[np];B[mp]
(;W[nr];B[mq];W[er]C[[u\] necessary! Otherwise you could cut and one group would die.]

(;B[hp]C[[u\] A good example of the moves i mentioned. Its very small and local.

Your group is stable and you can't attack white here.];W[jp]
C[[u\] luckily for you, white just played a weak attack];B[op]
;W[pp];B[no]C[[u\] good to get into the open];W[or]
(;B[io]C[[u\] and again to small and wrong direction. You gain 4 points and press the strong white group against your weak.]
;W[qk]C[[u\] white played the big point]
(;B[po]C[[u\] don't let white out so easy];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn]
;B[pm];W[ql]C[[u\] These last moves helped white to secure the territory and you get another wall facing your first wall with a white group between = no territory]
;B[qi]C[[u\] very good!];W[nl]C[[u\] overplay! That white move can't connect]

(;B[jm]C[[u\] another 2 points. Its better to cut here and let white fight]
;W[ko];B[kd]C[[u\] good move to get a wall];W[kc]
(;B[fe]C[broten [9k\]: want to add 5 minboth sides?

[u\] you need to play again to get your wall];W[gj]
(;B[gl]C[[u\] just extend];W[jd]C[goasis [8k?\]: ok];B[hj]C[goasis [8k?\]: gm
broten [9k\]: ok I did for you];W[ge];B[ff];W[ee]C[[u\] overplay!]

(;B[de]C[[u\] don't give in so easily. Fight back!];W[ef];B[eg]
;W[ed]
(;B[fg]C[[u\] you try to protect your 2 stones, but white can cut anyway.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[dg]
(;B[hg]C[[u\] possible, but why not use whites weakness];W[gf]
;B[gg];W[hi];B[ii]C[[u\] wrong direction. you weak stones are above]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[ih];B[ji];W[hh];B[jh]C[[u\] and your stones are dead]

(;W[kk]C[[u\] ah ok white don't want them :-)];B[jk];W[jl];B[jj]
;W[km];B[il];W[jn];B[im];W[ig];B[if]
(;W[gd]C[[u\] And white don't want to win this game];B[hf];W[jg]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[ke]
(;W[je]C[[u\] a good example of how to help your opponent. You have to thank white :-)]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[me]C[[u\] good move];W[ne]
(;B[nf]C[[u\] attach from the other side is better];W[md];B[mf]
;W[oe]
(;B[of];W[pe]
(;B[pf]C[[u\] don't give away your territory];W[qe];B[qd];W[re]
;B[rd]C[[u\] and now starts the endgame];W[sd];B[sc];W[od];B[nb]
;W[mb];B[nc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nd];B[rf];W[pb];B[qb];W[rc];B[se]
;W[pi];B[ph];W[oi]
(;B[li]TR[rj][eb][qm]C[[u\] This move is a mistake. You gain nothing.

To get better at the endgame, you have to learn the concept of sente

The marked points are sente and big too. Play them first!


I stop my comments here. The rest of the game is not imporant for the review.



Conclusion:
Everytime you want to play a move close to your own group, just think:

First: do i need this move to live?
Second: do i get a lot of territory?

If you answere both with no, then just look around and search for a big move.
Quite the best would be a move that gives you territory and attack your oppontent like move 45 on E12]
