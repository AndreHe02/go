C[Hi, I'm MegaKlant on igs!
I will try to comment on your game as well as I can. The difference between 25k and 15k might not always be that big.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn]C[W D6 could be considered here as well.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[pj]C[Another choice here would be J3 for B. That would secure the group and make it harder for white to attack. But Q10 is a big move if you know what you are doing.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ip]C[The usual move here would be Q14 to follow the joseki for the UR corner.  You might get into trouble when omitting this move. About J4, it seems a bit high. Look at the variation here to see what happens with the standard joseki.]

(;W[go]C[Ok, so W want to attack the black group.];B[gp]C[The B response is a safety move and will help W build a wall.]
;W[fo]C[And W is securing the stones are building a wall.]
(;B[di]C[Well, B is trying to prevent it. W could consider D9 or D13 here as possible moves.
I think B J6 could have been possible. See variation.];W[jc]
C[W notice that his group not yet has a base, but this move is to low I guess. K16 would be better. With D13 or D9 W would have had sente but now B got it.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[cd]C[I don't like this move. B16 is the joseki.]
;W[cc];B[bc]C[If you do this hane move you should be awere of its consequences.
For example W B16.];W[cb];B[ce]C[But white plays it quietly.]
;W[ef];B[cl];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[lq];W[lo]C[This move helps B to secure, but B gets no influence to the center.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[jo];W[pn];B[qn];W[po];B[qo];W[pm];B[qq]C[I belive this is a mistake. W can't be that successful invading now. What I'm trying to say is that W can't get any territory but maybe survive.]
;W[op];B[or];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[pf];W[ho]C[I don't see the point with this move. W won't get any extra strength nor any territory nor securing any unsafe group. Invading the B group will be very hard.]
;B[hp]C[I guess B don't have to respond. B K7,E8,F11,O14,O10 seems as simple resonable moves. I think I would have played O14.]
;W[jn];B[el]C[Good move but losing sente. Securing the position and getting into the center is however important for B here. B O14 would be an alternative. It might also have W to respond and B will be able to play E8 as the next move.]
;W[nf]C[W realy wants the center with a big moyo.];B[hl];W[jl]
;B[oj];W[oh];B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[nj];B[nk]C[W P9 here could be trouble for B.]
;W[mj];B[ok];W[ij]C[W whats the big moyo. But it should not be any trouble for black to get in there.]
;B[gh];W[gj];B[fj];W[eh];B[ei];W[dh];B[ch];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh]
;B[hj];W[bl]C[Strange move by W. Going for a small move and giving up the fight for his moyo.]
;B[bk];W[bm];B[gk];W[gg]C[When invading now, B should get to heavy. The stones should be spread out making it hard for W to control.]
;B[hg];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[jf];W[ih];B[hh];W[je];B[ik]C[Well consider other alternatives here to prevent K14 to be surrounded.]
;W[kf];B[jj];W[jg];B[if];W[ie];B[ke];W[kd];B[kg];W[le];B[jh]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[lh];B[kj];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[og];W[nh];B[li]
;W[ng];B[kl];W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[io];B[jp]C[Don't respond to that move. Find another bigger move elsewhere.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ds]C[I would respond with E2. Now W can force the E2 move by playing C1.]
;W[bb]C[W don't get much for that move. N6 would maybe give him more. Other move might "destroy" points for B.]
;B[ac]C[And again...];W[nr];B[en];W[eo];B[dn];W[do];B[jm];W[os]
;B[pr]C[What if B Q1 instead? Could of course be dangerous if there are upcoming ko-fights, but should otherwise save you a few points depending on how has sente when it is played.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[ls];B[ks];W[mq];B[kn];W[lp];B[in];W[qm];B[rm]
;W[rl];B[sm];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[si];W[sl];B[ro]C[Well, B is giving away another ko-threat.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[jr];B[lq];W[sn];B[kq];W[rn];B[so];W[cs];B[fr]
C[And B have this trouble again.];W[dm];B[cm];W[ck];B[dl];W[fn]
;B[em];W[bo]C[W B10 instead?];B[cj];W[bj];B[dk];W[ak];B[bi]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ck];B[ah];W[aj];B[fm]C[B O6 instead?];W[lk];B[nn]

;W[dg]C[W E15 instead?];B[ed];W[ab];B[be];W[ec];B[dc];W[db]
;B[fc];W[dd];B[ee];W[fb];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge]C[Oops...W lost alot of his potential territory and stones there. That E15 move was a real "killer".
I think both players played well. It is hard to tell how well, but about my strength with a few mistakes here and there. Maybe both players are to concerned about securing territoy with big walls. And also, it is not neccessary to respond to all of the moves from the opponent, especially not if they are bad.]
