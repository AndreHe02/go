C[Meccano [7k\]: Hello
bravani [7k\]: hi, have fun

Bravani's comments will be marked with [b\].

[b\] Hello everyone. I played this game on kgs (ranked game, 30 mins each player). Some considerations:

About my kind of playing:
I often try a particular fuseki (quite uncommon, i think) in order to create a mojo on a side. This works if my opponent plays timidly, but i think i still don't know how to deal with invasions when i try this strategy. I tend to act "jealous" of my mojos.
I can't judge territory very well. When the game was almost settled, i was in doubt about who was ahead (i won by 14,5 points). They often says "to judge territory, cancel out similar areas of opposite colors, etc"... But i still need to learn how do to this efficiently.
I'm stuck around 7kyu on KGS since more than a year. No big surprise: i have not a lot of time to study or play a lot of games.


About the game:
I added some variations (to illustrate sequences i was expecting)
I look at this game as a plain, quite relaxed one. I played my usual opening, and my opponent did not try to destroy my strategy from the beginning. I won a couple fights and killed two small groups of stones. Probebly this is the reason i won the game. I don't think i made really horrid moves in the following games, but i'd like to spot out the major flaws i made.

If someone is wanting to comment this game, i wish to express my sincere gratitude.

PS: Please forgive my not so good english.

[SM\] - Hello, I will be doing the review of your game. All my comments will be marked by [SM\].]
;B[pd]C[Meccano [7k\]: Have a nice game
Meccano [7k\]: Thank you];W[dp]C[bravani [7k\]: thank you too]
;B[po];W[dd];B[qj]C[[b\] This is my fuseki. I usually play B5 at R10 or R11.]
;W[pq];B[np]
(;W[qp];B[qo];W[nq]C[[sm\] as a general rule, it's not a good idea to play away from a contact play like this. responding also helps you seal in his bottom group, and gives some thickness facing his star point stone. (see variation)]
(;B[oj];W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[[b\] I was pretty satisfied with my mojo at this point.

[SM\] Your area on the right looks overconcentrated to me. I probably would have pincered white's stone. (see variation)]
;W[kd];B[fq];W[mp]
(;B[no];W[ip];B[cq]C[[sm\] In my opinion, this invasion is a mistake. You have to run out to keep your chances reducing his bottom. I would go so far as to say white is winning at this point.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp];W[fo];B[mq]
;W[oq]
(;B[df]C[[SM\] if you are going to cut below, you should do something with the stone. (see variation). A play along the bottom seems to be the only move.]
;W[lp];B[cj];W[cm]
(;B[ce]C[[sm\] this move only helped to make white stronger here. I'd play a double approach here.]
;W[cd];B[hc]MA[ch]C[[b\] After playing B37, i was afraid of white X or something similar.

[SM\] White X may have been painful, but your instinct to break up the top seems to be correct. If white were to get the whole top, you'd be behind.]
;W[fc];B[kc];W[jc];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[lc];B[kb]C[[b\] "when crosscutted, never atari". My opponent did it twice, but somehow i was not very happy.

[sm\] This looks like a very good result, considering that you played in an area white was strong in.]
;W[jb];B[ld];W[ke]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[le];W[kf];B[me];W[mc];B[ne]C[I ended up in gote here.]
;W[if];B[he];W[ie];B[fe];W[hd]
(;B[ei];W[de];B[ef];W[ee];B[gf];W[hf];B[mh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[lb]TR[md][mc][lc][nc]C[[b\] White is obliged to protect his X stones, so i can attack the corner.]
(;B[rd]C[[b\] I was in doubt about whic move is better, Black 77 or P19?

[sm\] This move works just fine. White has no way to live.]
;W[rc];B[re];W[sc];B[ra]C[[b\] White should be dead, i think.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[ln]C[[b\] I wanted to play this move since a while...]
;W[ji];B[jg];W[jf];B[kg];W[lf];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[jh];B[kj];W[jj];B[kk];W[jk];B[jn];W[km];B[lm];W[kn];B[kl]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[ko]C[[b\] Another dilemma: L5 or J7? Or maybe i should have tried to reduce white central territory from the left?

[sm\] this move is better because it can potentially give you access to the bottom territory. The center is extremely small at this point, and not worth worrying about.]
;W[im];B[lo];W[jo];B[kp];W[lq];B[kq];W[lr]C[[sm\]I would prefer to slide in at J2 over the game move (see variation)]
(;B[iq];W[hq];B[jp];W[io];B[ir];W[hr];B[fk];W[bf];B[cf];W[ch]
(;B[bg];W[be];B[cg];W[eh];B[fh];W[di];B[dj];W[fi];B[ej];W[ge]
;B[ff];W[gi];B[bl];W[bm];B[aq]C[[b\] I think defending is mandatory for my corner to live.]
;W[bh];B[ag];W[ah]C[[b\] I was worried. I was thinking to be a bit ahead.]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[bi];W[fd];B[ai]TR[be][bf]C[[b\] Almost seki (saved by damezumari of the X stones). I was lucky... I noticed the damezumari before, but i did not understand it could become the decisive variable.]
;W[cl]
(;B[bk]C[[b\] I was in doubt about playing this move (Black 51)  (see variation)]
;W[ek]
(;B[fj];W[fl]C[[sm\] if you want to play on the outside, do it directly.]
(;B[el];W[dk];B[gl];W[fm];B[hk]C[[sm\] a solid connection seems better here. It doesn't allow white to be able to force you to  reply.]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[ik];B[hj];W[hi];B[ro];W[rp];B[hp];W[fr];B[hn]
;W[in];B[gm];W[gn];B[hm];W[ho];B[kr]C[[b\] From now on, the game is pretty much settled.]

[b\] and Thank you for giving attention to my humble game :)

Black wins by 14,5 points.

[sm\] one thing that I can say needs work is your feeling for balance on the board. In the opening, you played too many moves in one area, letting white get a better overall development. White lost the game subsequent fighting, but I felt white had the advantage early on.]

(;B[iq]C[[b\] is a similar move better?
[sm\] the game move seems better to me. White can severely limit your moyo if you ignore this move. (see variation)]

(;W[oq];B[mp]C[[sm\] this looks far more promising than the game.]

(;W[mp];B[oq];W[nr];B[op];W[or];B[lq]C[[sm\] even if white cuts, I can't see how he can come out ahead here.]
)))
(;W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn]C[[b\]  This is the variation i usually expect (if no early invasion occurs).]
;W[nq]MA[oj][nj][pg][ph]C[[b\] moves at X are the ones i usually consider next...

[sm\] I think in this situation an extension along the top or an approach on the upper left corner would be better than the marked moves. Playing on the marked areas this early seems to leave black overconcentrated.]
