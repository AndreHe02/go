C[lenam [10k\]: hello
Pauzle [11k\]: hey, have fun :)

The review was requested by black. Comments by "Hinstock",  BGA 3 kyu. Feel free to email me with any questions about the review. This was an interesting game and thank you for letting me review it.

The most notable point is that both players, as they approach SDK level, need to get a better understanding of light and heavy stones.  A heavy group is one with little eye shape but too large to give up; it then becomes a target for attack.  A light group may offer the opportunity for exchange e.g. part may be cut off in gote, while the remainder becomes stronger.  You will find a deeper discussion on senseis.net

Black overlooked the power of the tiger's mouth formation.  See moves 65-70.  A basic strong shape that 10kyu needs to know.

The game finished with a complicated fight where it was difficult to read out the choices, but I have tried to indicate some tesuji that would have helped.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[This is the popular "Chinese" formation, which invites white to come in at Q5 (R5 is a mistake), so that black can attack while building territory on either side.

Normally white should be patient, develop his own formations and not rush in.]
;W[qo]C[Too deep - there's not room on the side if black blocks, so it's better to play on the fourth line for better escape to the centre]
(;B[np]C[This is too soft.  See variation for black]
(;W[pp]C[White at R3 or even S3 would settle the stones, see variations. Now black takes the vital 3-3 point and white has a clumsy shape.]
;B[qq];W[qf]TR[jd][nc][dj]C[White abandons the two stones in the bottom right for the moment, as it's hard to know what to do with them.

Note that when moving to a new area in the fuseki, it is better to choose the most open areas of the board e.g. at points marked. The move at 10 is not so valuable as there is less space there to develop - it shows the classic 'red-eye syndrome', jealousy of opponent's territory, just like move 6.]
;B[qh]C[Good.  This is both an extension and a pincer.  Such double-purpose moves tend to be more valuable than single purpose moves.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[qg]C[I'm not sure what is right next for black, but note that R15 is a key shape point for black.  You could consider blocking there, then although white can run out, he has an eyeless group]
(;B[pg];W[qd]
(;B[qc]C[Could consider wedging at R15, which connects your stones and creates cutting points in white's shape.  This 17 leaves your formation a bit too stretched as the result shows.]
;W[qe]C[A play at P17 protects both cuts.  Better shape, see variation.]
(;B[pe];W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nd];W[mc]TR[nc]C[The marked stone is not valuable, clinging to a strong black wall.  White should not waste time trying to defend it, since 26 creates a heavy group, which black can now attack, say at K16.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[lq]C[White creates a weak group on the bottom, while there is also a weak group on the right.  One of them should die.  If you must play in this area, a less greedy move such as the shoulder hit at K4 is better.  Still, it aims at the P3 cut so black defends.]
;B[nr];W[mq];B[op];W[oo]C[While it gives a nice warm feeling to play a forcing move, you need to consider two things
1) does it take away my options of playing differently later? i.e. is it aji keshi?  In this case, you lose the opportunity to play the peep and attack the group from the other side.
2) do I have to play it now? In this case, I don't imagine white will play at R4, which means you can bide your time before deciding whether to play at R4 or the peep.

The timing of little forcing moves like this can at times be a very advanced subject, (well beyond my pay grade) but at  10kyu it's time to start thinking about it.  If you haven't already done so, study the concept of aji keshi.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[no]C[Good, absolutely essential to push out, weakening white on both sides.

The situation now is that any efforts by white to save one of the bottom right groups will lead to the other one dying on a larger scale.  Both players seem to realise this and move on, waiting to see how the rest of the game evolves.  I think the right side is too big to ignore, but it's hard to say what is best.]
;W[gc];B[ci]C[Good.  Room for a 3-space extension either side.  White chooses the wrong approach, see variations.]
(;W[cg];B[cl]C[Now the top left corner is still open at the 3-3 point, and the lower left has a weakness, see variation if white plays elsewhere

White's formation at the top left is called the butterfly formation and is the wrong way to extend from the 4-4 point.  Better to have one long extension and one close play on the 3-4 or 3-5 point.]
(;W[ck];B[dk]C[with a 2-space third line extension, black can always play underneath to connect the two stones, whereas this move does not ensure your connection.  However, if your intention was to build strength in order to attack the bottom left, that too seems to be a good plan.]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[dl];W[dj];B[cr];W[di]C[should be at E10 to have more effect on black.  This is overconcentrated and purely defensive.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[gp]C[At this point white has three weak groups.  The strategy here is build strength by harassing each of them, not worrying about small areas of territory.   Sooner or later profit will inevitably come, either by one of the groups being swallowed up on a large scale, or sometimes the fight spills over into the opponents moyo which gets destroyed.

But you must make sure you don't get overextended, allowing a counterattack, which is what happened in the game.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[dn];B[fm]C[It looks like both sides read out the ladder.  Well done!]
;W[fn];B[el];W[go]
(;B[in]C[Hmm,  you should be aware that your left side group may be getting weaker and this stone doesn't make good shape with those below. H6 is a better eye-stealing point.  And now white gets the ideal G7.  See variations.]
;W[gm]SQ[go][fn]C[This is the tiger's mouth formation, bulging out towards the centre.  Black should not permit white to get this point.]
;B[hn]SQ[gl]C[A play at G8 would be more effective as you don't want to let white play atari which helps him move out into the centre..  If you were on a mission to kill white (who nearly has eyes on the side) this is not a good idea; it's so easy to get carried away like that.  Be satisfied to build some strength in the middle - which will help greatly when attention turns to white's two other weak groups and make sure your D8 group does not get weakened.]
;W[gn]
(;B[eo]C[Now black gets hemmed in and it's pretty hopeless for the group. This should have been at G8 bulging out into the centre and restricting white. 

See variation.

 Best to protect your self before going on the attack.  If the opponent is forced to make a one-point gote move to live, then you can almost always be happy.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[fo];W[do];B[em];W[hk];B[bn];W[bo];B[bp]
C[White can now capture B6 and win the semeai is beyond doubt. After white's next move, black cleverly gains a ko.]
;W[bq];B[ao];W[co];B[dq];W[bm];B[ak]C[OOPS. Not threatening the two stones.  White can capture at A6, so black dhould have started the ko rigt away.]
;W[bj];B[am];W[an];B[md]C[Black did well to create a ko from a dire situation, but this isn't really much of a ko threat as the white stones were already weak.  

Try S17, or two moves in a row to solidly kill Q5 AND extend the moyo.

It does however get into a very messy multi-stage ko];W[ap]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[jd];B[je];W[ie];B[jf];W[if];B[cc]C[Good switch, invading after allowing the white's outside to be built up, so that white becomes overconcentrated on the outside.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[ed];W[fc];B[bd];W[ce]
(;B[ea]C[White could have blocked at  B15, but now black can push there in sente.  White cannot ignore it see variation.]
;W[be];B[bb];W[hh]C[white was overcautious here and should have used the threat of rescuing the 4 bottom right stones, so.......]
;B[jk]TR[ji][jl][jm][ho]SQ[in][hn]C[right idea but a little too thin.  The two marked stones have a weak gap both above and below, so K8 would be better.  It's impossible to defend all three triangled weaknesses so don't try - choose the one that matters.]
;W[ho];B[hp]C[defends a few points at the bottom, whereas the right is more important.  J5 preferred.]
;W[io];B[jo];W[jn]C[Now it starts to fall apart];B[jm]SQ[jo]
[in][hn]C[This is asking too much.  You can't defend both sets of marked stones.  Atari from the other side will strengthen you main assets.]
;W[kn];B[im];W[jp];B[lo];W[ko];B[lm];W[om];B[qm];W[rl]C[Neat.]
;B[ql];W[rm];B[ok]C[Fine.  Now white can make one eye on the side but not two.  Kill this and you are back in the game.]
;W[nl];B[mk]TR[jf][je][pf][pg][qh][nd][md][kd][pe][pd]SQ[lj]
[lk][mj]C[Too close, which gives white the opportunity to make forcing moves and threaten you in return.  As happened.

Given your strength in the marked stones above, white has nowhee to run to so there is no need to worry about letting white push in a bit further, so long as he cannot make an eye.  Just retreat a little to one of the squared points and your group is strong and white's opportunity for eyes has not improved.]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[kl];W[km];B[ln];W[mj];B[oj]
;W[lj];B[kk];W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[mi]C[Atari isn't the only option.  Quite often it is bad because you lose the choice of which side to atari.  It's worth looking more critically before rushing into an automatic atari.

This position is difficult to read, but I offer the variations to illustrate the power of the extension to L12.]

(;B[kg]C[See variation.  Black can set up a sqeeze.  Situations like this are quite common and worth a little study.]
;W[lh];B[ij]C[Black has 4 liberties only at this point.  The way to see it is to count the number of moves to capture, excluding any which are replied to, and to take advantage of the false eye with a throw-in.]
(;W[lg];B[lf]LB[nk:A][nl:A][ml:A][ll:A]C[When white defends, black has to kill the AA group before his group to the left of it dies.  Eye stealing is key to the play.]
;W[ng]LB[ml:B][ll:A];B[ol];W[nn];B[nm]C[good];W[mm];B[mn]C[At this point, whote's 5 stones are doomed.  But white had a huge profit after winning the semeai on the left, so does not need to save the whole group, just part of it.
