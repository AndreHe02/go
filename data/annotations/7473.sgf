C[This was a three hour game I played in an online tournament against an opponent 5 stones stronger than me, who unfortunately did not give me a review after the game. In the end I felt that I had done pretty well for my standards. Having put a lot of thought into every move I'm now hoping for some useful comments on them. Thank you very much!]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[eq]C[crazyd - This is fine locally, but E4 would be more consistent with your first two moves.]
;W[do];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr]C[This was not joseki, I didn't know them but have looked them up after the game. Still I feel like I got a fair result here...]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[hp]C[crazyd - Your first two moves said you want to play an influence-oriented fast game.  Your next four moves said "No, now I want slow, solid territory."  Your last move is back to influence.  Your moves don't work together, so they lose a lot of value.  H3 would be a local territorial move and E5 might be better if you want to get back to your opening style.  Q18 - finishing the unfinished corner is also big (threatens an invasion around M17 later).]
;W[qn];B[qp]C[Is this too small? I thought about R5 instead, but R4 just felt more solid.
Or should I have pincered and strengthen the right side, abandonning the corner? That for some reason did not feel right.

crazyd - This is too slow.  Reacting with R5 is also bad as it strengthens an attackable stone.  It is only good if you already had a pincer around Q/R10.  A pincer now would be better than your move, or a move around N/O3 looks better to me than your move.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[on];B[ci]C[C 14 instead? I thought it might be easier to settle from here.

crazyd - This looks fine to me.  If you play C14 white might pincer your stone around here.]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df]C[Bad shape, I know - any better move?

crazyd - This is okay and sets up a later invasion around C7.]
;W[fd];B[cm]C[Playing a stronger opponent this was probably too fighting orientated. What about N3 instead?

crazyd - As I said, this is a fine move when the time comes.  Right now I think your N3 idea is good, or a move like Q18.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[fo];B[gm]C[crazyd - Good sequence for black.]
;W[ho];B[bk]C[crazyd - White offered you a chance to fix your shape with G4.]
;W[bl];B[bj];W[cl];B[bn]C[crazyd - No point to this move.  It is bad shape and doesn't even threaten to connect black or to cut white.  B7, G4 and G9 are locally better moves.]
;W[bo];B[gp]C[crazyd - Yes!];W[go];B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[cn];B[dn]
C[crazyd - Good fighting spirit.];W[an];B[co];W[bm];B[cn];W[en]
;B[dm];W[dp];B[io];W[fj];B[im];W[in];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj]C[Should I have cut at F11 instead?

crazyd - Since the ladder is broken by K16 it doesn't seem like it.  Later E10 might prove to be the better cut, so saving the choice is better.]
;W[ei];B[jn];W[bg];B[bf];W[ch];B[dh];W[hn];B[jo];W[jm];B[jl]
C[crazyd - This ladder is good for black so J8 seems better.]
;W[km];B[jj];W[hm];B[hl]C[I guess here I should have played J7 and kept W separated, but my hope was to establish eyespace around G9 with this move. Turned out that wouldn't work either...]
;W[kl];B[kk]C[crazyd - Ignoring J8 twice is too much.  If black connects then the L7 stones are cut off and could come under attack later.]
;W[lp];B[lo]C[crazyd - As you can see, if  you had played J8 then M6 would be a good move now.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[fp];B[gq]C[This did not work, but I couldn't find anything that would have worked. Have I left my stones too weak earlier already?

crazyd - I see nothing wrong for black if you played F3.  This empty triangle is very bad (shortage of liberties).]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[jp];W[er];B[lk];W[il];B[mp]C[Was this too small?

crazyd - I don't think so.];W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[gk];W[ne];B[bd]
C[crazyd - Playing away from the fight in the center for some endgame points is a bad idea.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[nb]C[I probably should have connected at R15, but that felt so slow.]

;W[cb];B[bb];W[cd];B[bc];W[ah];B[cg]C[Any better defense here?

crazyd - Both sides have made what look like poor choices to me, but I am trying to make comments to reinforce your understanding of basic principles.  You can email me and let me know if I succeeded.]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[fn];B[fm];W[ch];B[dr]C[crazyd - for example - local ko threats are good and outside ko threats (where you don't give up points) are better than inside threats.  D11 or A14 would be better than D2.]

;B[gd]C[crazyd - Can you see the value of  black F13 instead of here?  It obviates the white wedge at J15.]

;W[lh];B[li];W[mi];B[ih];W[ig];B[ii];W[mj];B[lj]C[Should I have tried to connect P9 and P11 rather than making the second eye?

crazyd - This late in the game I think it would be too risky.]

[ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Finally a general endgame question: I felt like I kept gote all the time - where could I have taken sente? Any better endgame strategy? I'm always pretty bad in the endgame...

Thank you very much!

crazyd - Knowing the value of the endgame sequences [counting\] and whether something is sente or gote or gote-no-sente (gote with a sente follow-up) or reverse sente or sente over ice with a twist of lime [judgement\] are the two parts to deciding the sequence of endgame moves.  The first step is learning to take the biggest value move on your turn.  When you get to dan level you are supposed to start thinking about which move order is optimal.]
