;B[pd]C[
ISK: Hi I will try to review the game from both point of views, black and white, focusing on black.   This way you get to see the general mistakes white made.]
;W[pp]C[Typhoon [17k\]: ty u2];B[dc];W[dq];B[cf];W[do];B[jd]
;W[cj]C[ISK: Direction Error, should be R14 more potentional of development in that direction, not much potential here.  Also playing R14, it would force black into early fight (white genearlly being stronger) this would be to his advantage.]

(;B[pj]LB[qn:A]C[ISK: A bit easy there, you can go all the way to R6 (A).  Only thing you have to be care of is the pincer, and know how to handle that.  Another alternative is O3 (B).  Different style can work b/c of the D3/D5 moyo enclosere, could be painful if misshandled thou.  Please look at alternatives to see how to handle R6 (A) follow ups.]
;W[bg];B[jf]C[fuseki ok until here? suggestions?

ISK: Ignoring B13 = VERY VERY GOOD.  but K14 is too small :(.  At this time O3 is the biggest move on the board.  Cut whites stone off from it's allies.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[ISK: Rule for hane is as follows:

1) If you are strong extend.
2) If you are weak hane, and fight.

Rule for extending.

1) Extend to 3rd line if extanding from 4th line. Extend to 4th if extending from 3rd.

Determing if you are strong:
Simply count the number of stones in the area in question.

In this case you have 2, white has 1.  So you out gun him.  Simple extanding and taking solid profit would be a good option.]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[db];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[ac];B[qn]C[good?

ISK: Right idea, but from O3 side.];W[nq];B[jo]LB[lq:A][dr:B]
[nd:C][fq:D][cp:E][iq:F]C[wasn't sure about k5

ISK: Your thinking is right. To me following moves are possible at this point:

1) M3 (A)
2) D2 Probe (B)
3) O15 Corner enclosure (C)
4) F3 Kakari (D)
5) C4 Probe (E)
6) J3 (Safest) (F)

So as you see there are alot of chooices.  "F" beign the safest because no matter what white does you get to make 2 point extention eithr way.  It's not the best move.  I gave moves int he order I think that they fit the best.

1) It's important again to split white and cause a fight, use your upper moyo to put pressure on white.

2) It's good to find out what white values the outside? Or corner?

3) This is a tricky tactic.  The point is not the corner profit, but the tick that white will invade, and you will attack white to gain profit.  Not by killing but by making you moyo bigger.

4) This move can be very troublesome, as it requires very deep reading, b/c white will PINCER it.  So lots of fighting with this.

5) This move, is a simple probe to see if white values the corner or not, 9/10 white will play D4.  Which gives you a follow up at C7 again.  Also this time makes J3 (F) a really good point, b/c u are taking away the power of his wall.  So why did I rank "E" at #5?  B/c the timing for #5 is very tricky :(,  even I muck up on it >,<]
;W[jq]
(;B[mo]C[ISK: Wrong direction.  You have no potentila there.   b/c white play Q6, and runins all you moyo, and you get stuck with 2 weak stones in middle.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[nc]C[ISK: Here you can try O18 hane to see how white reacts. Look at the verations please.]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[go]C[ISK: BAD tenuki.  You need R14 as you found out later.  It's very big move.  As it makes you solid and makes you moyo very hard to invade.]
;W[gq]C[where to play now?

ISK: Fix your own weakness before attacking your opponent, R14!!!!]
;B[lq];W[qe]C[ISK: Kaboom :( white noticed it ;__;];B[pe];W[qf]

(;W[nh]C[ISK: Oversite on white's part, he should play R12 and rune ur side. Look at the veration.]
;B[rh];W[rf];B[ri];W[ni];B[oj];W[jh]C[and now?

ISK: Black is in tough position, you are all cut up ;(.

My recommendation is to make White's four stones object of attack. by starting with E10.]
;B[lh]C[ISK: Too direct.];W[li];B[ki];W[kh];B[lg];W[lj];B[jj]
;W[ro];B[qo]C[ISK: This is an  early xmas present fro white, if you are going to do ne thing, might as well block with S6.]
;W[qp];B[rn];W[dg]C[ISK: See now you end in gote, and white gets to take a key point.]

(;B[ef]C[ISK: No need to answer that.  Your stones are in no real danger.  Should play some to hur white, he ignored your K10 move, PUNISH HIM.]
;W[df];B[de];W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg];W[fn];B[gn];W[gm]
(;B[fm]C[ISK: Not a good cut, you can't get ne thing there, but playing G12 gives you more options.]
;W[gl];B[gh];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi]C[a way to win the fight?

ISK: Don't make white's life easy?  Really you are just answering white's move, take the initiavte. G10 cap looks interseting, but not right, I would suggest the nose tesuji at G9.]

(;B[ko];W[lp];B[lo];W[mq]LB[rp:A][dn:B][cm:C][cp:D][cl:E]C[ISK: At this point I see following moves for black.

1) S4 End-Game (A)
2) D6 Light Reduction (B)
3) C7 Deep Reduction (C)
4) C4 Peep? (Don't know if it will work) (D)
5) C8 Deep Invation/Attempt to attack White's group above (E)

** Look at the example for "E".]
(;B[en]C[ISK: The game is decided when white lived in center.  There is not much black can do from this point.  I will make some general comments on how to reduce to minimize the damage but not possible to win this now.]

Typhoon [17k\]: gg thx
kaktus [19k\]: bye

ISK: Over all your gave is not bad, keep at it :D.  

Few things to kep in mind.

1) Don't attack directly, attack indirectly to gain something.
2) Don't make small moyo moves in openning play big.
3) Make splitting attacks, it helps you gain power.  And you are able to kill one group or another.
4) Look at the whole world, don't just look at one local area.
5) Keep in mind your weaknesses, and your opponents weaknesses.  Always fix your own weakness before attacking opponents.
6) Making a solid shape over attacking is better then attacking and leavinga  weakness behind.  The weakness becomes a lone from bank, which piles up with interset.  So when you have to pay it, it costs you 10x.
7) I feel you were trying new stuff in this game? right?  Keep at it, you will see the furits of your labour soon :D.]

(;W[oo]LB[qq:A][jq:B]C[ISK: Since the other joseki works in blacks favor, white will most likely do this, as it works well with D5/D3 corner enclosure.

So you have two choice here, 1) S3 (A), or K3 (B).  R3 will get you into trouble as white will seal you into the corner, K3 is a bit more flexiable.  You are ablet o cause white lots of chaos >=D.  Chaos good right? :p]
