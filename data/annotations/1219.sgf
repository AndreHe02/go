Hello,

I want to know how to improve my game and what I did wrong.
I played white and my rating in IGS is 12k.
Thank you.

;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc]C[Perhaps p16?

RR:  No, white played correct.
RR:  After looking at this again, and getting beat in the exact same position, the R14 stone does force white to play P16.  Black did not take advantage of this overplay.]
;B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[cf];W[df]
TR[nb]C[I tried to build a wall. This is ok?

RR:  Nothing wrong with trying to build a wall here.  However, there are bigger points on the board.

The top of the board is not worth very much, because of the open black stone.  Maybe a pincer at C12 is good here too?  Hard to tell.]
;B[dg];W[ce]C[Change of plans, I take big corner.

RR:  And black takes a big side in exchange.];B[cg];W[ef];B[hc]
;W[fc];B[kc];W[mb]C[Maybe this was mistake? But now black cannot connect.

RR:  No, this was not a mistake.  It is good to keep black seperated here.  Also, I *think* that white can kill the corner if black ignores this move, although I just tried to play it out, and I don't see the sequence.]
;B[qb];W[ld]TR[ge][gb]C[To small? Maybe m15 better? or even l16?

RR:  small is a good word.  In this situation, you want to think big.  White has a strong wall in the upper left corner.  The way to use a wall is to push your opponent into your wall, not to expand from it.

Thinking along those lines, I would attack the 2 black stones (which is white's intention I think) from the left hand side.   Either high at G15, or low at G18.]
;B[kd];W[le];B[he]C[Black has a good strong shape now.];W[qn]
TR[nq][np]C[RR:  I would have attacked this stone from the other direction.  Probably at either O3 or O4.  This would force black to extend towards the white wall.

I also notice that white has no stones in the lower left quadrant of the board.  Its getting late in the game, and white needs to play some moves around here.]
;B[np];W[on]C[Building a moyo.];B[pm]TR[qm]C[Nice to learn new invasions.

RR:  Invasions are usually associated with territory.  This is Moyo.  Black is testing white, to see what he would do.  Instead of connecting, white could extend to R7, and create 3rd line territory, at the expense of giving black a huge moyo towards the middle.  I think that connecting is the right move here.]
;W[pn];B[pk];W[pi]TR[nm]C[RR:  With this move, it seems that white want to use its wall and make some territory in the upper side of the board.  This is a very small piece of territory (although it looks big because its in the center.)
I see maybe 30 points in the area.

To attack the two black stones, push them towards the white wall, with a move around O7.  This will give white some strength to mess around in  the bottom of the board.]
;B[nl]C[RR:  Black makes a nice shape here.  very hard to attack.]
;W[rp]TR[mn]C[RR:  Its good to get a base, but in this situation, I think its even more important to get into the center.  N6 seems like a vital point for both sides.]
;B[qq];W[rl]C[Taking black´s base.

RR:  Good.];B[rk];W[ql];B[qk];W[pl]TR[mn]C[Is this overplay? I should have played o10 or n6 perhaps.

RR:  I think that at this point, black is in trouble.  When your opponent is in trouble, there are two things you can do:
1.  Play close to him (touching stones) and get him out of trouble.
2.  Play a bit farther away (1-3 spaces) and let him figure out how to get out of trouble.

I prefer #2 above.  By not forcing all of your opponents moves, they have to figure out how to live.  By playing your stone at Q8, black will sacrafice one stone, to get a black connection from the side to the middle.  An exchange that favors black.  White caputures one stone, and hardly any territory, and only 1 eye.    Instead of your move at Q8, think larger, and play something like N6.  Black can't capture the 2 stones (R8 and S8) and blacks stones are still under attack.]
;B[ok];W[ol]C[Now black escaped.];B[nj];W[nh]C[My wall became very small territory.

RR:  When played perfectly, walls should have ZERO territory.  Use walls to push your opponent against,  not to make territory.

This is a VERY important concept in go.  Try it out in your next game.  No only is it successful, but alot of fun too!]
;B[mh];W[ni]TR[mk]C[Perhaps n11 would have been better?

RR:  I see nothing wrong with whites move here.  N11 would get a large fight.

Peeping at N9 is also a good move now.  It makes black heavy, and puts a white stone in the middle of where black is trying to go.]
;B[mi];W[mg]C[I should have cut from n10?

RR:  N10 would be a good cut, after a peep at N9.];B[mk]C[RR:  black plays the vital spot]
;W[dn]C[RR:  This is a good place for white to play.];B[ck]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[eq];W[cl];B[dk];W[bq];B[cr];W[bl];B[bk]
;W[jq]C[RR:  Whites play seems good so far.  Black should have extended somewhere around where white just played.]
;B[hq];W[mq]TR[eg][kg][be]C[Here game seems even.

RR:  Ok.  lets quantify

WHITE:  Upper left still open, maybe 10 points.  upper right, slightly open  23 points.  Lower right, probably 2 eyes, 7 points, lower side, 6 points, and lower left, 9 points = 55 points

BLACK:  Upper group, still open from right side, might die, 2 points.  Upper right, 6 points, lower right, might die, 2 points.  lower left, 10 points, left side, 14 points.  right/middle group, 1 eye, 3 points + influence = 35

So, in points, white is ahead.  in influence, black is ahead.  If white can attack black and fortify his position at the same time, white will win.

key points on the board right now.
E-13:  Keeps black groups from connecting, while white gets a finger into the black controlled middle.

L-13:  Same reason as before

B15:  solidifies white corner, while threating to break into blacks side.]
;B[nq];W[mp]C[RR:  This is good stratagy.  Keep black small in the corner, and try to get influence into the center.]
;B[no];W[mn]C[This was bad move. Instead something like s3?

RR:  yeah, bad move.  It serves almost no purpose.

S3 would be a good move, as would K5.];B[mo];W[lo]TR[kp]C[RR:  This move leaves too many cutting points.  Instead, try something like L4]
;B[nn];W[nm]C[Because of this mistake

RR:  No way to stop black from connecting.  Instead, worry about life and death of the two groups that are being cut.]
;B[mm];W[om];B[ln]C[Now I have two weak groups.

RR:  I disagree.  You have 1 group with 2 eyes, and 1 weak group.

By black attacking the weak white group, he will get a nice wall in the center, and turn that into black territory.  This will be bad for white.]
;W[ko];B[rq];W[qp]TR[ro]C[RR:  The shape with 2 white stones and the 3 black stones is bad shape.  Try to avoid it.  I would have played at S5 directly.  I think that is alive.]
;B[sp];W[ro];B[sl];W[sm];B[sk];W[rn]TR[po]C[Perhaps black could have killed me by playing t6?

RR:  White has an eye with Q5 now also.  This was a needed move.]
;B[lg];W[lf];B[kg];W[eg]C[RR:  Good move for white.  But, if white can keep the upper 4 stones from connecting, that would be god too.]
;B[eh];W[jm]C[RR:  Another good move for white.];B[kn];W[jn]
;B[lp]C[I should have played m3.

RR:  Probably true.  But to sacrafice 2 stones to live is not bad either.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[io];W[jo];B[ip];W[ir]C[Black makes profit by chasin me.

RR:  yeah...  I hate it when that happens.

Lets add up the scores again.

W 48
B  40 + influence.  This counts zero for the above 4 stones again, but if it connects, it could make some territory.]
;B[hr];W[hs];B[gs];W[is];B[fr];W[iq]C[Making eyes. perhaps something better? Run to the center or towards by left side group?
Aims at g5.

RR:  Already have 1 eye on the bottom.  I think that jumping to the center is a good idea.

g5 seems like a vital point.];B[gp];W[hm];B[dl];W[dm];B[am]

RR:  Still the nasty peep at C17.  But now the corner is big]

C[Making eyespace and perhaps connect.];B[gn];W[em]C[RR:  empty triangle shape should be avoided.  To connect, play at F7 instead.]

2.  Make sure to solidify your walls for endgame!
