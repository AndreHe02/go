Hi, i'm marc from germany, currently studying Baduk in korea. My rank is 2d KGS, 5d CyberOro. I will try to answer all your questions and point at mistakes. At the last move, i will write a summary about the game and the majormistakes.]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[do]C[this is biggest because of d16, right ?

M: usually approaching a 3-4 stone is bigger then approaching a 4-4 stone, and you can also do it from "your side"... so yes, correct move]
;W[dm];B[fo];W[fq];B[cq];W[cr]
(;B[cp]C[unusual move in this joseki, it is only used, when you are trying to settle your group very quickly, but on an empty board this isn't necessary, and you can follow the normal joseki (see variation)]
;W[cj]TR[ci]C[looks a little bit strange, but i like white's idea of preventing a pincerattack ( i would have played it at C11, looks little bit lighter and like a better distance]
;B[br]C[unnecessary and too small, there is no need to settle your group directly, it is not under attack (and can also not be attacked by a single move)]
;W[hp];B[oc];W[pj]
(;B[np]C[right point to come in ?

M: no. High approaches to the 4-4 are usually only good, when you are trying to build up a moyo on the side. here it is exactly the opposite, actually you are facing white stones behind you. White can easily grab a huge amount of territory and your stones look very useless
Low approach or 3-3 are both playable here (see variation)]

(;W[lp]C[normal joseki is much better...(see varation)  This move makes no sense]

(;B[nn]C[Don't like this move either. Basically you are making white last move good by letting him make territory whil chasing you.]
;W[pn];B[lo]C[this might have been a mistake as i cant play k3/4 later now

M: true, but now Q6 is already there for white, so the Q3 attackment isn't that effective anymore for black. So black is already in trouble and it is difficult to get out of it. I think the move is okay, because no matter where you play, you will either remove the Aji at Q8 or at K3.]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[jp]
(;B[cf]TR[ch]C[preparing to attack c10 group

maybe linking top with k16 is bigger ?

M: right direction, and not a bad move at all, but not working well if your intention was to prepare an attack on C10.  If you want to attack C10 group, then usually you have to play C12. If you play C12 now your stones look to close to each other and overconcentrated. So here it would be better to play C12 right away.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[gc];B[ec];W[kn];B[mk];W[ol];B[bm]C[it is not really possible to attack the white group. Since you played C14 instead of C12, there is enough space. Also L7 is most likely to be sente fo white. Also C6 is kinda painful for you, so you attacking move does not work at all]
;W[cn];B[bn]C[i misread, thinking my d5 stones could fight and live against whites weak c6 group]
;W[co];B[bo];W[dp]
(;B[dn]C[This move is only good if you really want to kill all. This is unrealistic here so no need to be greedy.]
;W[cm];B[em];W[el]
(;B[dl]C[M: does not work];W[cl];B[ck];W[dk];B[bk]C[noticed too late the squeeze doesnt work : )]
;W[fm]C[white is now clearly ahead, while black has still a weak group in the bottom right. Blacks only hope is a very good attack on the two white stones on the top, but also this got more difficult, since white has very strong shape now around E8]
;B[km]C[mistake in direction of play ?

M:
no, it is okay. You have to take care of this group, because otherwise by chasing it, while will make his moyo even bigger]
;W[jm];B[kl];W[jl];B[qq]C[time to take the last open corner now ?

M:
yes, it is good timing, even though i would have prefered an attack on the topstones, since it is unlikely for you to end in sente here, and even after grabbing the corner, black would be behind, if white defends his topstones]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qp];B[rr];W[rp];B[oq];W[op];B[nq];W[mo];B[mp]
;W[qg]C[i really wanted to get here first, but it looked like everything before was pretty much forced... : (

was planing on playing q12, is that good/better than r12 ?

M: True, very big move, but the corner was bigger to my mind. Also K17 is still weak and now, since Blacks group isn't weak anymore, it is a little bit risky for white to leave it like that.
I would have prefered R12, since you then would have the option to continue at S10]
;B[ph]C[mistake

M: just too early. Main goal now is a severe attack on the K17 stones, but you don't know exactly how that will evolve and which forcing move in the Q12 area is best.]
;W[qh]C[lucky... : )

M: i think this is okay for white];B[pg];W[pi];B[nh]C[this shape is still very weak, since the (white) hane at Q14 will be very painful for black]
;W[kk]C[good forcing move];B[ll]
(;W[lk]C[but bad continuation, white already got his forcing move in sente, and should now take care of his K17 stones, getting gote here is unnecessary]
;B[ml];W[jk]C[black isnt happy now, was planing on attacking k17 strongly with little white influence around

M: as i wrote, getting gote here was unnecessary for white, but if he does not connect here, M9 would be completly wasted.]
;B[ib]C[good attacking move, black has to attack severaly here, otherwise he loses]

(;W[jb]C[wrong response];B[gb];W[fb];B[hc];W[hd];B[gd];W[ge]
;B[fc]C[the sequence here is actually a good way for white to settle his shape quickly...]

(;W[fe]C[but that move completly curshes the whole idea. White has to play more lightly here]
;B[id];W[ie]C[??? white has 2 options: Tenuki and treat those stones lightly, or connect and continue playing locally. But this move is a desaster]

(;B[jd]C[not bad, but there is something better];W[ef];B[he]
;W[hf];B[je]
(;W[jf]C[same again... Connecting is much better, but here whites position collapses]
;B[if];W[ig];B[kf];W[ie];B[jg];W[pf];B[qf]C[before making such cuts, you should read out, what will happen.]
;W[qe]
(;B[pe]
(;W[rf];B[of];W[qf];B[pd];W[jh];B[if];W[kg]C[White should just connect the double atari and be happy about the points he gained in the center (3rd time, he makes such mistake)]
;B[hg]C[good punishment];W[jf];B[gf];W[hh]
(;B[eg]C[capturing the stones isn't bad, but i would prefer to push more and try to capture them bigger]
;W[gh];B[ei];W[fj];B[kr]C[good endgame];W[jr]
(;B[lq];W[kq];B[kp];W[jq];B[dr]C[i noticed thought white could do something with b3, but i guess i was mistaken

M: there is only some endgame aji, but nothing serious. Still this move is big in terms of engame, even though D10 or S16 would be bigger]
;W[er];B[cs];W[di];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[bh];B[bg]C[seems to be the biggest point, no ?

(;W[sd]C[wrong endgame];B[sc];W[lr];B[mr];W[ks];B[pm]C[was going to try to capture q4 group, thinking i was behind... should have counted first i guess...
M: true, Black is already clearly ahead, and this attemapt is hopeless (and loses points)]

C[sillyness here, i thought i was creating aji...

M: nothing here, except lost points];W[lp];B[jo];W[kp];B[en]
;W[fn];B[es];W[fs];B[gs]TR[em][dn][en][do]C[lol...

M: marked white stones are in atari and no way to get out. Again you lose points by hopeless moves. 

There is not much reading required here, and such moves do not really improve your strength or style of Go, might offend the opponents and actually lose points.]

M:
In the opening, you made some bad decissions (move 17 was clearly bad, as explained there, move 25 could have been better, even though the direction was already correct) After the messup in the lower left with loosing all those stones, you were behind by a lot. In such difficult positions, it is worth to take the time, trying to read it out (this was kind of a slow game, afaik), since messing this up, can easily decide the game. Luckily for you, your opponent wasted sente in the center, when he played move 72, and your decission, to attack the top group was perfect. Even though white missplayed a lot in this fight, and also you made some mistakes here, the overall idea was correct and well executed. This gave you back the lead. Afterwards it was just endgame to play.
About the engame, i think i already said everything important at move 171. Just skip those obviously not working moves and it will improve your style a lot. (and actually i think, you lose more games by points lost in such a stupid way than you win by blackout-25k-mistakes of your opponent) Also I think, the game would be more enjoyable for all sides then ;)]
