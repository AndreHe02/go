C[Joey - Hi, I'm submitting my game for review
for the first time, so any suggestion is appreciated.  Thanks.

You show some good insight into some of your misplays. To summarize you tried to save some heavy or dead groups as you recognized. You also missed a big play in the UL and misread a ladder. These combined to take the game from you. w missed some chances too, but he seemed to suffer less.]

;B[ng]LB[oc:A][pf:B][qf:C][mc:D]C[Joey - That doesn't feel like a good move; i later felt that i should've covered the UR corner

I agree. A-C come to mind as better moves. D or something else on the top might even be considered. The problem with your move is that it doesn't really support either the UR or the top. It sort of seems to be trying to keep w from escaping to the center, but distance from your other stones is too great for that.]

LB[qn:A][nq:B][fq:C][ch:D]C[Joey - This doesn't seem like a good move, but I'm not sure what to do at the moment

I agree again. This move would only be good if it could really separate w's stones, but that doesn't happen. You should anticipate w's next move.

If you don't know what to play here, maybe it is a sign to play elsewhere like an approach move against either of w's other corners (A-C). D also deserves some consideration as an extension.]
;W[od];B[md];W[pc];B[qd]MA[nd]C[Being forced to make this move is the negative fallout of the move at X.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qi]
(;B[qg]MA[pi]C[Joey - Should i have put the stone at x instead?

I don't think so. See alternate.];W[pi];B[ri];W[rj];B[rh];W[qj]
;B[qn];W[pk];B[oj]MA[qn]C[Joey - I'm not sure if it's worth that step to save the 1 stone

I agree. Comparing this stone to the one at X, X is far more likely to be saved and to do some damage to w.]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[ql]MA[qn]C[X is now weaker because it is the shadow of w's wall of stones.]
;B[nq];W[oo];B[qq]MA[pq][qp]C[Joey - Is this the correct move? or one of the x's ?

I like this move. The alternates might be OK too. I am not sure.]

LB[fq:A]C[This move is questionable. You have to ask whether or not you are going to be able to escape here or if price will be too great. I like A better.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[nm]C[Joey - I tried to escape, but...];B[nk]
C[This is a good move to play sometime. I don't know if this is the best time.]
;W[nl];B[jp];W[np]LB[gq:A][fq:B]MA[jp]C[A or something like it seems better. b had a choice between X and an approach at A or B. w should probably try to take the other possibility. Both choices have their merits but you shouldn't expect to get both.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[gq]C[Well w gets his move anyway I guess.]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[gr]LB[ch:A]C[I don't like this move much. It ends up to be gote and sort of small. I like A or some kind of invasion in the LL corner.]

;B[iq];W[cm]LB[cg:A]C[This is a conservative move. I don't think the cutting point is that dangerous. I like A better.]
;B[ch]C[Good!];W[ee];B[de]MA[df]LB[eh:A]C[Joey - That doesn't seem like the correct response...should've been at x ?

I am not sure. The game move seems OK to me. A might be a consideration, aiming at w's moyo and possibly capturing w's stone on a large scale.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[dd];B[ef]C[Joey - That's not very good move

Yes, just connect and then exploit whatever cutting points are left.]

;B[hd];W[ge];B[gd]LB[in:A]C[Maybe b could afford to leave this weakness now and play something like A to come out into w's moyo.]
;W[lf];B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[jf];B[in]LB[lf:A]C[OK, w should probably have played here instead of at A.]
;W[lk];B[lj]LB[in:A]C[Again, you have to ask whether or not you should try to save these weak stones or play from the stronger A stone.]

There is no ladder breaker!  See alternate. Easy to be fooled unless you read it out. This is a big point value mistake for this late in the game. b might even have been able to save the triangle stones or at least extend toward the left.]
