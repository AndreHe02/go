Hi, I m a 10k KGS / 14k IGS player. I played this game against a 9k KGS.
I loose big time :-)
After the fuseki, I had the feeling I was leading the game but I totaly lost control in the middle game.

P : Hi! My name's Peter. these days, I'm waffling between 4-5k on kgs.
This is a very interesting game. You took a very definite whole-board strategy very early on, trying to build a massive central moyo. the majority of the game was characterized by the invasion of that moyo and the solidification of white territory on the sides. In this review, I'll be looking mostly at that strategy, and considering the particular battles and tactics in terms of that big moyo.

First off though, I used to often play for the big moyo, but I stopped because of how, when people played that strategy against me, I considered it a gift. With one big moyo, the opponent only needs one succesful invasion, one good capture, to destroy all your plans. and you only need to make one mistake or to leave one insecure place to have your whole strategy ruined.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[ce]C[My goal is C15-D17 but I often get contered with W D17.
In the other hand, if I begin with D17, I get W C15 more often and usualy I prefer B C15 - W D17 than the over way arround.

P : I never really play the 5-3 opening, but it looks interesting, force your opponent low in the corner and build influence around them.]
;W[dc];B[fd]C[P : This is a very complicated joseki to choose, with lots of different choices for both sides. Because of there being so many different outcomes, white chose to play the other corner first, to see how you'd respond. 

Personally, I prefer e16 to f16, making a straightforward leaning joseki where black would have a beautiful wall, leaving the corner open, with few complications.]
;W[dq]C[W ignore F16 and play the last corner, is it normal ?]
;B[co]C[Anyway, I chose to aproach the last corner and not attack the upper left one...
I liked the C5 - C15 - F16 position.

p: This would look really good if f16 was at e16, with the nice wall, but now it  means w must play in such a way in the upper left that black's thickness doesn't face the bottom left.]
;W[fc];B[gc]C[G17 is probably not the best response in this situation. E16 better ?
Probably BE16, WE17 and BG16 ? Help with my original idea of C5 C15 F16 ?

P : You're right, e16 would have worked better with your original plan., but this move works well with q16]
;W[ed];B[fe]C[I checked after, joseky is F18. The problem is that as not good with my original idea...]
;W[ee]
(;B[ef]C[P : pushing in this way is bad. it leaves behind a lot of bad cuts, which are what get you in trouble later and cost you the game. The term 'thickness' means having a position with few or no weak points. unfortunately, the wall you get from this sequence is not thick  under that definition.

I prefer having c15 run along the left side. W's last move at e15 is quite bad in my opinion, being too high with a black stone underneath. d15 would have been better, so b ought to take advantage of this! See variation.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg]C[P : w play very submissively...]
;B[bh];W[de]C[I have the feeling I let realy to much of the corner to W...

P : ya, it's a huge corner, but your wall has a lot of potential. this move by w is unnecessary, so you could take the opportunity to fix your cuts with h16 -- then w would have a very hard time.

 remember! the cuts at g16 and f14 are possible because the ladders don't work!]

(;B[eo]C[Try to box the think a little...

P : . I prefer playing e4 here. Check out the variation for the two main ways that could go, both of which are quite good for black.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[dp]C[P : This move is quite pointless, and it in fact makes black stronger, but w likes it so much that they play it in the other other corner too.]
;B[do];W[bq];B[oq]C[Aproach the last corner];W[qr]C[W response doesnt seem right to me, too flat but I have the feeling I didnt exploit it realy well...]
;B[oo]C[P : this is where your strategy runs into trouble. trying to close off the whole centre like this is not feasible. better to extend l4 or m4.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[ql];B[ol]C[P : Again, better to extend from your wall on line p. w gets way way too much in this sequence along the right side, and all you get in compensation is a very thin position.]
;W[qi];B[oi];W[qf];B[of];W[qd];B[kd]C[Was pretty happy with the overall position.
Was I wrong ?

P : the one big moyo strategy looks really pretty -- i used to think that this would look like a sure-win for black, but now I think black's going to have a hard time. black has gambled everything on this one big area and now will be on the defensive for the rest of the game. W has sente for almost the entire rest of the game, which means that with every single move white is gaining and you are losing. I don't think there's a moyo big enough to allow a player to lose ground every move for a hundred moves and still win the game. don't put all your eggs in one basket -- keep your options open, try and find ways to pressure white.

also, wr16 really requires a response to avoid losing the corner.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[od]
(;B[nd]C[P : this is too passive. don't let white get exactly what they hoped for. consider the variation.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]C[P : be careful with the n17 cut.]
;W[di];B[fi]C[It probably went wrong there. I still have dificulty attacking. I had the feeling this attack was doomed but W succeded anyway.

P : I prefer connecting here, but this seems ok too.];W[dm]
;B[bm]C[stealing the base...

P : It is often wise to seal in from the outside before stealing their base or robbing their eyes, especially because you're lower than them at both c5 and b12, so you could steal the base anytime, even if they tried to defend it. f7 was the move here.]
;W[dh];B[cj];W[dj];B[ck];W[bi];B[ci]C[P : good solid play by black.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[dl]
(;B[ah]C[P : this move is very small. white connecting underneath is worth at most ten points, is gote, and is not urgent, while attacking the white stones on d line is huge, sente, and urgent. I like f9 or g9 instead. see variation.]
;W[hm]
(;B[ho]C[P : this is not a good move. it's not doing anything on the bottom, it's not threatening the w group.  see variation.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[kq];B[ir]C[P : this  move is pretty weak. you were worried about the connection underneath, but again, better to play on the outside than on the inside. forcing w to connect in gote underneath would be good for black, so best to cap at l5 if you really want to respond to wl3, but best of all is to attack the white group above.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[ko];B[lp];W[kp];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm]C[P : this exchange is much better for w than for b. b gets a wall facing a wall, while w gets to play more stones in b's moyo and gets closer to connecting their two weak groups.

You are trying to do too much. you want to hold on to every inch of your big moyo, so you respond to every white incursion as forcefully as possible, but it's impossible to hold onto all of it, and it ends in disaster. rather than these past three moves, consider splitting w at f7, or sealing w in from above, closing off your moyo on the top. also consider a counter attack on the right side, as described earlier. the game is still winnable for black at this point.]

;W[ej];B[fm]C[Not the best way to attack.
Maybe E7 ?

P : I like f7. i belive f7 is the vital point.];W[fn];B[en]
;W[em];B[gm];W[fl];B[ek];W[gn];B[hn];W[gl];B[fo]C[P : It's very bad to take gote here when you have so many cutting points on the outside. your group on the left can fend for itself. best to play h11 now.]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[ii];B[jk];W[jj];B[ih]C[P : Whoah snapback! try and learn to spot this tesuji. it comes up all the time.]

;W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[hf]C[P : looking good here. w's invasion was unreasonable, and you did not allow them anything. but be mindful of cutting points!]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[li];B[lh];W[lk];B[ll];W[kk];B[jl];W[nk];B[nl]
C[P : this move lets w connect. why not block? you could have blocked in sente at q9, threatening to cause trouble on the right.]
;W[oj]C[I think I should have played around H17 to kill W...]
;B[ok];W[nj];B[pj];W[pi];B[ni];W[pk];B[qj];W[rj];B[mi];W[qk]
;B[pm];W[oh];B[ng]C[P : this move is very small and unimportant, as was the white move before it. you played q7 threatening to cut into w's area -- why not do it?]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[pg];B[og]C[P : There's a concept in go called 'ambient temperature'. you can look it up in sensei's library for more detail, but basically the temperature of the board is the size of the largest move remaning to be played. this move by black is worth five points, so it's a move that's much cooler/smaller than the ambient temperature, so you played it too soon.]

[sh][si][sj][sk][sl][sq][sr][ss]C[P : A very interesting game indeed. Some things to think about from this game are general strategic points, like building up multiple areas of influence and remaning flexible / avoiding commiting to an area or course of action too early ; gain initiative through attack ; consider the size of moves and the ambient temperature of the board ; always always think about cut points, and ask yourself what happens if your opponent cuts.
