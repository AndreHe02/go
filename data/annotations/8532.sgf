C[Hi!

Though I am 2k, I lost this game, so would be happy about lots of advice and inspiration. Especially after the fuseki I felt left behind already..
You can comment for black as well though!

Thanks!
Niko (bubblebear)

MR: You will find my comments always starting with "MR".

MR: To make some general remarks: 
I think that it would be helpful for you to try to think about sente and gote in the choice of basic joseki in the opening *before* playing the joseki. I know that this is quite hard, so just try every now and then. In the game, you allowed your opponent to play quite a number of moves in the bottom/right area of the board, before you entered, and it appeared that you did not really like this situation. Choosing sente variation elsewhere may offer the opportunity for earlier action in such areas.
Another important point is to play lightly in enemy's sphere of influence - as well as in situations when you are behind and want to cause some trouble. 
Yet another point is to think about the strength of own and enemy groups *before* deciding about an attack.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep];W[eq]C[Which Joseki would you recommend?

MR: I personally do not like the joseki you chose because it is "just what black wants". However, this is a matter of taste.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]
(;W[dn]C[MR: As far as I know. the usual moves are C6 or D5. They have the advantage that C8 is not such a good move for black (see later moves in the game).]
;B[jp];W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[ci]C[MR: In my opinion, white should tenuki and play on the right side. 
If D6 were at C6, the variation white C13, black C8, white E17 would be another good option.]

C[where to play better now..?
MR: White needs to play on the right side.];W[qk];B[qm];W[qh]
;B[pb]C[I felt that black gets too much at the bottom.

and can you tell me how to deal with the top right group after q18? some possibilities and when to play them.

MR: 
With respect to the bottom, you simply allowed black to play several moves more than you in this area. You had a chance to play here earlier instead of C9, for example. But still, the black bottom is not yet territory! You could, e.g., invade at M3.

With respect to the black group in the top right: This group is simply alive as it is. So doing nothing is fine for both sides at the moment. Later, P18 is the usual endgame move if white want to secure territory at the top. If black tenukis, R18 is the correct follow up.]

(;W[pr]C[MR: Usually, white plays R4.];B[or];W[qr];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[sq];B[so];W[rs];B[rj]C[good attack by black]
(;W[qj]C[MR: In my opinion, white should play more lightly here.]
;B[ri]
(;W[qi]C[MR: Still, white should play more lightly ...];B[rh]
(;W[ol]C[any better move from your point of view?

MR: Yes, you should make up your might on where to make territory. 
It is not such a wise idea to run into the area where black is very strong already! It is also a good idea to choose moves where you have a good follow up.]
;B[ld]C[good move again I felt
MR: The usual move in this area is M17. M16 is just asking white to make territory with M17.]
(;W[ne];B[jc];W[ic];B[kc]
(;W[hd]C[MR: The usual shape and eye destroying move is J18.]
;B[lf];W[me];B[le];W[ng];B[lh]C[good for black., he is even closing in my right groups now

MR: What did you expect? Did you want to kill the M16 group? To me, this looks like an expectable result.]
(;W[lj]C[MR: I am not really sure that your right side group(s) are strong enough for a good attack. I would prefer to connect safely with O11 first.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[mi]C[MR: Good!]
(;W[oi]C[MR: This move does *not* connect your two groups! Should be at P12.]
;B[mj];W[ml];B[lk]C[MR: The development to M9 shows that M10 was an overplay!

The game is already difficult for white. 
White needs to develop some idea on where to cause some trouble ...

I would play something lightly, so that I could see what to do with it depending on the black reaction. Some ideas would be M4 or H2, but these are already emergency methods, as white will lose when just playing ordinary moves.]
;W[ll]C[MR: The following sequence is too heavy, from my perspective.]

(;W[ek]C[MR: This would be the "usual" move. Even if white cannot connect F11, black cannot convert the center to territory because white can jump in around G14.]
