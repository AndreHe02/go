C[Hi reviewer, I played black and I think at the end I lost by a about 10 point and I did not have enough time to continue.

[EV\] Hello this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  This was a solid game with a good opening and few mistakes.   I did not see any glaring faults in the play by either side, but I hope you will find some of my comments useful anyway.]

;W[fc];B[dc];W[jd];B[mc]C[Is this ok? any suggestion

[EV\] An aggressive approach at M17 is most common, threatening a serious invasion at H16 or H17.  However, I think this move is also good.]
;W[fe]C[[EV\] W could consider omitting this reinforcement, given the mild B approach move.]
;B[eq]C[not sure about this approach. How about d3 or c3 to take corner?

[EV\] All three moves are good, but of course lead to very different games.]
;W[cq];B[hq];W[ck];B[kq];W[qh]
(;B[qe]C[[EV\] This is the first move I do not like, though I would not call it a serious error.  It seems you are defending a fairly strong corner instead of the weaker side.  I would prefer to reinforce the weak group while blocking W from making a base with a move at R10.  See variations.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[rj]C[[EV\] The proverb says to extend after a crosscut, not atari, and in this case it is correct.  See variations and next comment.]
;W[qi];B[ql]C[I think this move is bad. The idea is to live in sente. I think I need to play top-right corner.

[EV\] This move is good, but omit the preceding exchange, which is aji-keshi.  W will then be much more constrained, forced to play in a way which defends against both S10 and R11.  W will not even be able to capture the Q10 cutting stone if B decides to run.  By fixing the shape with an unnecessary atari, B removes much of W defensive burden.]
;W[oj];B[rp];W[qq];B[df];W[ch];B[eg]C[not sure about this move.  Should I invade in top white group?

[EV\] This move is fine.  It is much better to prepare an invasion properly, even if your opponent defends first, than to invade without sufficient strength to back it up.  W is strong enough above that there is no severe invasion, and if W gets a move here, the center starts looking big.]
;W[kc];B[me];W[mg]
(;B[cl]C[[EV\] Good invasion -- nice timing and nice placement.  I would first consider the move one space lower, but it does not work out so well (see variation).]
;W[dk]
(;B[dl]C[[EV\] However this continuation seems a little too direct, as the W hane in response is painful.  I would spend some time looking for a lighter response.  Some possibilities are shown.]
;W[el]
(;B[em];W[dm];B[dn]C[[EV\] Atari at F8 before it is too late, to make the most of this sacrifice.]
;W[cm];B[cn];W[bl];B[eo];W[bn];B[co];W[bo]C[[EV\] This result is good for W -- the B invasion was not a success.]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[cp]C[[EV\] Moderately large, but not worth losing sente.  Continuing at M3 is much more important.]
;W[bp];B[dq];W[rq];B[bq];W[kr];B[jr];W[fm]C[[EV\] I think this move is too small.  W is already immensely thick here, and making center territory will be difficult with the B stone at E13 sticking out.]
;B[lq]C[[EV\] Good, back on track here, after a few pauses:)]
;W[nr];B[mp];W[nq];B[jq];W[mo];B[lp]LB[eb:D][lb:C][bg:E][ro:A]
[cr:B]C[how about this move? should I ignore?

[EV\] You should take the sente atari at Q8 first, since it helps limit the potential W center territory, and the Q10 stone no longer has much aji to preserve.  Other large yose moves are marked.  I think all of these moves are larger than N5 or M4.]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[ro];W[ri];B[cg];W[oo];B[rm]
C[is this necessary?

[EV\] Yes, it looks like W is now threatening to kill.  The hanging connection at T9 would live with a little more territory.]
;W[bh];B[hh]C[How to approach the centre now?

[EV\] The center is not so big.  I would first consider a move at the bottom, safely expanding B territory a little while reducing W center a little.  W does not have a single move which can enclose a large center territory, since B has reducing moves from many directions.]

;B[gf];W[ff];B[ih];W[hi]C[[EV\] W got 15 center points by capturing a few stones and can get more later by exploiting the weakness at K12.  B could have reduced the W center this much by safely picking away at the outside.]
