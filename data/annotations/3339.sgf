AB[pd][dp]C[Hi.  Thanks for reviewing this game where I took white and lost.  While playing this game, I really couldn't tell that I was losing, and even after looking back at it, it's hard for me to see where I went wrong.  Any insights you come up with will be greatly appreciated.

F Hallo, I've tried to give you some hints where the game went wrong for you. If you had no idea you were losing during the game, than maybe you should build in some moments during the game to try to evaluate the situation. Depending on what you count/estimate, you can decide what to do:  consolidate a winning game, try some bold actions when you're behind, or resign when you're way behind. I think if you do so, you could progress, because otherwise you play a solid game . So don't take my comments too hard, even if they seem to be so :-)]
;W[qo];B[pp]C[I am not familiar with any joseki that start like this.  Black seemed to come out better, getting lots of territory on the bottom.  How could I have played this corner better?]
;W[qp];B[pq]
(;W[qq]C[F: This is not good. Black gets too much influence and your corner is too small. See variation]
;B[po];W[pn]C[overplay?

;B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[ro];B[qk];W[np]LB[oo:a]C[F: This would be good if there was a stone at a. But here black could even play hane on his nextt move]

(;B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[ip];W[ok];B[dd]
(;W[fc]C[F: You could try to exploit the weaknes of black stones on the right first. See variations. But this is also all right.]
;B[pk]C[F: Better not play this exchange and play at Q11 right away.]
;W[oj];B[qi];W[cf];B[ee];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[bc];W[bb];B[be]
;W[nd]C[F: First exchange A17 for B 16];B[lc]
(;W[ic]C[F: Wrong direction. You're strong on the left upper side. You should attackthe black stone from the other side.. See a possiblity in the variation]
;B[nc]
(;W[qf]MA[nd]C[This looks wrong to me, but I played it because I was worried black was getting too much territory.  What follows are probably lots of mistakes, but I seemed to come out okay, getting a large top side.  Am I right in feeling this way?


F: Your marked stone now is kind of wasted. You could try to make use ot it (see variation), but that's alsno not very satisfactory. If you're afraind black is getting too much territory, you could play in the corner right away.]

(;B[qg]C[F: Very bad. Black should just defend his corner. His stones on the right are not in danger.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[qc]C[F: Good !];B[qd];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[of]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[rc];W[oe];B[pe];W[nf];B[og];W[ge]C[big enough?

F: This sure is a success for white, althoug there remains some aji in the black stones on the upper side.  (as you found out later)]
;B[fd]C[F: Not good];W[gd];B[ab]C[F: White can just connect]

(;W[ec];B[cb];W[db];B[ba]C[F: Now black is very strong and any attack on the corner is kind of futile.]
;W[ef];B[bf];W[ff];B[cg];W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[jo];W[fp];B[fq]

(;W[ep]C[F: No ! You should confine black to his corner and make influcence. Now black gets his corner, while you get not much in return]
;B[eq];W[do];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[dk]LB[cj:a]C[F: Better at a (C11) . Now black can just connect to his upper left corner.]
;B[dl];W[el];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[ci]
(;W[gp]LB[ng:a][jn:b]C[Maybe this is where things start to go wrong for me.  This move seems irrelevant now.  I guess I thought I'd threaten to reduce black's lower side, but I didn't have that kind of time.  If I had just played d7 or d12 it would have been easy to get enough of the center to win.  What do you think?

F: This is for sure a big move, but this is maybe the time you should have a look at the whole board and try to figure out who is winning.

Black has about 67 points:
Upper left  16 points
Upper right 27 points
Lower left 10 points
Lower middle 14 points

You have about 48 points
 Upper side 40 points (depending on what happens in the center) 
Lower right corner: 8 points

Conclusion; If you play for the center, you should make there more than 20 points to win. There are only two big holes in the center: a  (O13) and b (K6) If you play one ot these, than you slhould be able to make more than 20 points in the centre.  So yes, I think you should have played for the center, but not by playing at d7 or d12 but at O13. See variation]

(;W[dg];B[ej];W[gi];B[md]C[I figured if he tried to make life with these stones, I would probably benefit by killing or confining them.  Was this a bad idea?  Should I have been able to kill them?

F: I think you should be able too kill them. If not you can resign. But it won't be easy, because you have to watch out for your own stones around P 17.]

(;W[me]C[F: This is giving black good shape];B[le];W[lf];B[ke]
;W[kf];B[je]
(;W[jf]C[F: Now you should try something on the upper side, your own stones are more or less safe.]

(;W[ja];B[na];W[oa];B[lb];W[gq]C[I need a big move.....Where's the big move??  Here?

F: This is a big move of course, but after black lives in your moyo, you're too far behind. (end of comments)]

;B[jp]C[I often struggle with the question of whether it's time to try to take territory in the middle.  It's usually so hard to get much return and those moves on the side get so big at this stage.  But here I figured I needed as much center as I could get.  But where to play to do that?

Heck, I guess I've lost by now already so it's probably not even relevant in this game.]
