AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Arminius [21k?\]: hello
rpglover64 [25k?\]: hello

R: Hi. I am playing mostly on turn-based sites: dragongoserver and littlegolem where I am ranked around 10k. 
I will prefix my comments with R. Mostly I will follow the B moves, but also if I will spot some W clever (or dummy moves) I will note too.
Hope you'll enjoy.];W[ed];B[cd]LB[jc:B][cg:A]C[Was this approach smart? or should I have focued on solidifying the sides?

R: In handicap game, the general advice for B is to play solid and careful. W has to force, to make "strange" moves, provoking the opp.
This approach is good, it aimes the side. But also is complex. More easy way would be c13.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cg]C[C14?

R: Well, as I said, W wants to make the situation as much as possible complicated. Usual joseki is the variant. The way it was played, B stones are weak without gaining important influence.]
;W[hd];B[jc]C[R: Middle move is good when establishing influence. Attacking an already strong group it doesn't look suitable.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[jd]C[R: W allows B recover. I would jump in, n17 for instance, instead.]
;B[kd]C[R: again risky. Why not l17?];W[dg];B[dh];W[cf];B[bf]
;W[df];B[bh];W[fh];B[dk]C[R: good.];W[bd];B[be];W[ei];B[di]
;W[ek]
(;B[dj]C[R: not a threat. Already have a high situation, go on.]
;W[ej]C[R: not needed. e8 much more important];B[eh];W[eg];B[jq]
C[R: good. imagine having e8 development already in place. still e8 is missed.]
;W[kf];B[me]LB[lc:B][mc:C][je:A]C[Was this move necessary at all?  Also, would N16 have been better?

R: the problem is coming from l16 move. It leaves aji in an already scarce group. l14 doesn't really threat, but prepares an invasion.
It depends in the plans. k15 would act well cutting the W and creating a solid base arround, m17 would ensure much of the side and influencing the corner. You have to establish your aims and follow them.
Imagine now Wq13.];W[jk];B[pk]LB[qm:A][mp:B]C[R: the gap is to large between the corners. The up corner looks solid, but the bottom one not.]
;W[nj];B[ph]C[R: too far. q11, or maybe r12, but risky. How about o8? It establish a deal of influences: W gets safer moyo, and B extends its interest in center.]
;W[nl]C[R: W takes it ;). Yes, nice.];B[om];W[nm];B[on]C[R: W doesn't give up. Now look at e8 and continuation, and consider having o8. It would limit and make B safe.]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[mn];B[ko]LB[el:B][jo:C][mp:A]C[R: Again, the gap is too large. N4 would get the side. If you want to influence center, e8 is the answer. K5 also is an opportunity, making possible either n4 or e7]
;W[no];B[oo];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]C[R: W takes the advantage of the large gap.]
;B[jp];W[lo];B[kn]CR[jo]C[R: the k5 cut point is far too big. Sometimes, you should let them (weak stones) alone, and somehow during the game they will help you, either as aji threat, or bringing them to life.]
;W[kq];B[kr]
(;W[mq]C[R: oh no, should be m2!];B[lr];W[ln]C[R: really doesn't need. W should cut at k5.]
;B[im]C[R: yes, it defends a little cutting point, but is a larger move. Risky.]
;W[km]C[R: k6? should work for white.];B[in];W[jm];B[il];W[ik]
;B[jl];W[kl];B[fp]LB[el:A][em:B]C[I don't know about this move...  It was instinctive, but it seems wrong in retrospect.
R: well, it is not wrong as itself, but because there are other alternative much more interesting. F4 isn't really required, already the B wall at j line is enough. The corner isn't much solidified with it, and there is really no help for left side. Instead, e8 is a must.]
;W[em];B[dm]C[R: Don't attack in contact. Is a GO rule. c7 is an alternative.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[el];B[en]C[R: c8 is an ugly aji.];W[fn];B[cn]
C[R: yes, have to defend. I would preffer d6, closes almost all the aji posibilities (better even than c6) and blocks e5 threat.]
;W[eo]C[R: which comes immediately.];B[dn];W[fo];B[ep];W[gp]
;B[gq];W[hp]
(;B[io]C[R: why that?];W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[R: oh, no. The weak stone is g3, not the group k3.]
;W[hq]
(;B[hr]C[Is the group to the right in trouble yet?  Should I have done something here?

R: yes, B is in trouble. 2 moves wrongly placed lead to this situation. In fact, this is the third! (see variation). But still it isn't catastrophic.
In such situations, think in life and dead terms. The 2 groups are splitted. But are they alive? Yes, that's good news. Both are living. So, W managed to cut them, but that's all. The loss in teritory is large enough, but still playing with handicap the most important goal is to keep the groups alive.]

(;W[go]C[R: W miss first shoot. B now can and avoid W loving complications.]
;B[mh]LB[ic:B][oi:A][oq:C]C[This move, too, feels wrong.
R: no, it is ok. In fact, looks bigger than connect down side. Other big moves are shown.
Before this move, having sente, it could be appropriate time to sit and count. B: 36p on left + 20p in right down + 30p in up area = 86p. W: 20p up + 50p in center (most) = 70p. B is leading, so you should just strength your positions.]
;W[ic]C[R: W spots one ;)];B[kc]LB[lc:A][je:B]C[Ws there a better way instead of directly connecting?
R: already answered... But giving the fact that W is attacking, l17 is well positioned.]
;W[lh];B[lg]LB[mg:A][mi:B]C[R: again, risky. B doesn't need fights, but to live securely.]
;W[kg];B[lf];W[nh]
(;B[mg]C[R: no need.];W[oh]C[R: good.];B[og];W[ng];B[nf]C[R: again W forced lots of aji left behind.]
;W[pi];B[pf]LB[pg:A][qh:B]C[R: almost forced. Like c6 move, a better move (more solid) would be connecting (A or B).]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[qj];B[pj];W[oi];B[qk]CR[rl]C[R: you could consider s8: it gives more teritory, but you end in sente.]
;W[rj];B[qg]CR[rf]C[R: same (s14)];W[rg];B[rf];W[rh];B[rk];W[sk]
;B[sl];W[sj];B[rm]C[Could I have done something against the white group on the right?
R: see previous comments...];W[sf]
(;B[re]C[R: oh, no!];W[se]
(;B[rd]C[R: com'n. Stop it. Why do you let W go through your teritory?
Yes, sometimes a invasion on the last line isn't stopped right away. Imagine you wouldn't have q14, and W would have a stone on p14. In such cases, you let 2 stones to be placed in invasion, but almost never more than 2 stones. Threatening to capture 2 stones forces W to defend and let B close the door.]
;W[sd];B[rc];W[sc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ra]C[R: B made 8 points gift to W... But I think B still leading.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[jb];B[kb];W[oq];B[pq];W[hb];B[mi];W[gr]C[I just realized that I misread that in the game...]
;B[ir]C[R: should work that way too. My previous variantes looked differently.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[R: look for safer moves. This is to close.];W[er];B[dr]
;W[es];B[ds];W[hs];B[is]C[R: no, this way W could bring you down!
The group could live either with k1, or n2. Try it.]
(;W[gs]C[R: big mistake, W misses the chance to kill.]
(;B[ls]C[R: well, another chance for W!]
(;W[mr]C[R: wrong! W should at least try to kill!];B[js]C[Was this move necessary?
R: more than that!];W[pr];B[qr];W[mj];B[li]LB[bc:A][li:B][gl:E]
[do:C][op:F][or:D]C[Was there a better way to reduce White's territory?
R: no, it's ok. Again, let's count. B: 36p in left + 24p in right down +  30p in right up = 90p. W: 20p in left up + 40 (at most)p in center = 60p. Lot ahead! Where are the most interesting points? Look the marks. How many points brings each? Almost the same. Which to play? The most pushes ones, which force W to answer. F is one of them, A also. C doesn't look, but it brings 10 points.]

R: oh, no! C5 is a mistake.];W[cp];B[dq];W[cq];B[bp];W[cr]LB[bq:A]
C[R: W could hit harder: b3.];B[bq];W[br];B[ar];W[bs]C[R: not needed. W also shoul go for hot points, is still back.]
;B[bo]C[R: again, unnecessary];W[cs]C[R: not needed...]
(;B[gn]LB[bc:A][op:B]C[R: 4 points. An alternative is the variant.]

;W[dd];B[bc]C[R: good.];W[cb]
(;B[ad]C[R: go further. No need to stop here.];W[eb]C[R: What is that? W won't defend like this. B18 is the move.]
;B[bb]C[R: good];W[ba];B[lk]C[Should I hve gone D18?
R: yes!!! ;)];W[mk];B[ok];W[mm];B[ms];W[ns];B[ps];W[or];B[nn]

;B[tt]LB[ab:A][jn:B]C[Yeah, I shouldn't have passed; should dame points be played out?
R: just count. W has arround 70 points (including prisoners), B arround 60 points. Either start k15 attack, or resign...
About passing, yes, there arew still open teritories. In fact, 2 more moves.
About neutral points. The rules said that yes, the neutral points have to be played by both players, alternatively. I personally don't do that, but I can accept when opponent wants to. Because I consider is a waste of time, both for me and opponent. Of course, you could discover that covering all the neutral points an alive group could die, but such situations are read before, usualy.]

rpglover64 [23k?\]: thank you for the game
R: Well, I think your rank is under the power play you shown. There are few mistakes (close the door of last line invasions, more care about leaving ajis behind, use ladder to capture: s3 instead r4) which can be easily corrected. Also, some choices weren't the optimum way. Keep playing and try to eliminate your little mistake and soon you'll advance!

Good luck, Radu])
