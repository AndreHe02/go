C[Hello, I would like to thank whoever reviews this game in advance. ^_^

I'm white in this game. My opponent loses on time, but the kgs prediction has me in the lead by 4.5 moku.

Chew: Howdy.  I preface all of my notes with "Chew:", so you can search the game for that to see my notes.  Overall, you play very well.  You play a good opening, and your moves are much more efficient than your opponent's.  You did catch your biggest mistake in your own review, which shows good ability to inspect and learn from mistakes.  As the game progresses, watch your groups and those of your opponent, and keep in mind which are stable.  If your group is weak, support it.  If your opponent's group is weak, see if attacking it might benefit you (either from killing or letting you build walls or surround territory).  Early on, your opponent had a stable group on the left side, for example.  If he had realized that it was fine, he could have stopped playing there and focused on more important areas of the map.  Watching weak groups versus strong groups kind of shows which areas of the board are urgent.]

;W[qj];B[qh];W[qm];B[pf]TR[fc][oh][oi]C[Chew: I know this isn't your move, but know that this is a bit small.  This protects against an invasion at R14, but your stones below are not strong enough to allow you to invade yet.  Playing away is what I would do in B's shoes, but if I were to play locally I'd play something that threatens your white stones below.  For example, B could consider the triangled points, of which I prefer F17.]
;W[fc];B[cj];W[ch];B[dn];W[cn]C[Chew: This move is okay.  It helps B stabilize, but makes him over-condensed.  Expect the following followup.]
;B[cm];W[co]
(;B[bn]C[Chew: B seems indecisive about what he wants.]
(;W[bm]C[Chew: of the available cuts and wedge, this is the least interesting to me.  Basically, if B lives low, that is fine because he gives up a lot.  I would consider C8 or D7 to force B low and claim a ton of influence.]
;B[bl];W[dm];B[cl];W[en];B[dl];W[em];B[bo];W[bp]C[Chew: This ended fantastically for you.  W seems to be doing great here.  B has two corners that are still loose and open to invasion and a clunky group on the left.  Notice that, since you built the thickness in the bottom left, your stones really want to extend along the bottom, to J3 or so, at next opportunity.]
;B[bi];W[bh]TR[nc][iq][jq]C[Chew: While this is solid and reasonable, keep in mind that the black group has two eyes and is safe.  While you could be undercut here, I would consider playing elsewhere (see triangles for options).  Again, this move is fine, but since black stabilized, keep in mind that this area is less urgent.]
;B[ej];W[eh];B[gj];W[nc]C[Chew: This is perfect.  As I said a few moves ago, the black stones are safe but they are playing as though they are running for their lives.  Playing away in a large, available area is a great way to make a territory grab to show your opponent how slow his move was.  I would have prioritized the bottom since you have so much thickness, but this is certainly second best and definitely reasonable.]
;B[pb];W[kc];B[iq];W[gq]C[Chew: Since B got to J3 first, you were forced mroe dense than you would like.  This move is forced after J3, though.]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[gs]C[Chew: Again, G1 was not threatening that much.  It is an endgame move.  It threatens a small reduction, but I would probably take the opportunity to take something larger, like one of the followups.]

(;W[fs];B[hs];W[fr];B[hq];W[go]C[Chew: Again, this is okay but a bit slow.  Your stones are safe.  B's move threatens to seal them in, but you would benefit more from expanding the top or plaing to aid your weaker right-side group.]
;B[fh]C[Do either of the hanes work in this situation?

F11 seems to just create a weak group...
F13 has a cross-cut that seems adventagous for white

Chew:  Black's shape is too strong for F11 on your part to threaten much.  See the followup]

(;W[eg]C[Chew: as you guessed, this move is safe but too passive.  F13 is the better, more aggressive option.  You have the stones nearby to support, so you can play that way safely.]
;B[ei];W[gh]C[Chew: This is too thin.  This allows black to cut straight between this and your stones to the left.  F13 or G13 would have kept your stones connected, but this risks the followup.]

(;B[gi]C[Chew: Luckily, B backs off rather than cut, so you are able to connect.]
;W[fg];B[fi]C[Black should have responded at H12... This just makes bad shape]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[ih]C[Chew: These last few moves have been very good.  You are building a huge framework on top and B is building a wall where it is not terribly useful.  You were correct to let him push you as far in this direction as he wanted, it only helps you.]

;W[rm];B[po];W[pn];B[oo]C[The first sequence that I'm curious about is here. I wasn't exactly sure where to play, so I opted to reduce the bottom black group.

What is the biggest area of the board at this point?
Should I try to reduce blacks corner, the bottom or the middle?]
;W[kq]C[Chew: Fantastic!  L3 or L4 is highly unlikely to kill anything, but B is thin enough that your invasion is likely to live and reduce his potential]
;B[kr];W[lq];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr]
(;W[nr]C[This move shouldn't have worked. In hindsight, black should have played P4.]

(;B[or];W[np];B[oq];W[no];B[nn]
(;W[lo]C[I was thinking that I could just make an eye for this group and this group would be fine, but considering the sequence following this, it probably would have been better to:
1. hane at N6
2. Knight jump to K5
3. One space/ diagonal jump J5];B[mn]
(;W[nl]CR[qj][qm][rm][pn][sn][qo][ro]TR[lo][no][np][kq][lq]
[mq]C[I thought the group at M5 was safe, but my opponent was able to use it against me.

Chew: You pointed this out, which means that afterwards, you recognize your mistake.  Basically, you had the triangle group and the circle group.  The circle group has an eye at S6 and another one in the area of S8, so you know that group is very much stable.  The poor triangles, on the other hand, have maybe one eye and have enemy stones working to surround them.  Unless you plan to sacrifice a group, help the one that is not stable.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[io];W[kn];B[ll];W[in];B[hn];W[ho];B[jo]C[Would L7 have been a better choice in this case?

Possibly K4...]

;W[il];B[hl]
(;W[jj]C[Chew: Good idea, but a bit ambitious.  K9 looks safer.  Because this knight's move is too thin, B can successfully cut, as he seems to.]
;B[jk]
(;W[ik]
(;B[im]
(;W[kk]
(;B[kl]C[Can White L7 save this group?

Chew: To put it simply, no.  White has one eye at M4, but black has successfully cut it off on all sides.  W would have to kill something to survive, and B's nearby groups are too strong to kill in time.]

(;W[jm];B[jl];W[lk];B[ml];W[mk];B[on];W[hk];B[gk];W[gl];B[ij]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[ki]C[Chew: at this point, we see that L6 is quite dead.  The fact that you lost such a large group and are still able to compete in this game shows how very far ahead you were prior to this fight.  Had you played a little more safely and saved that group, you would have been tremendously far ahead.  As it stands, time to fight to overcome this setback!  

There are two things I am getting at here.
1) Your opening was much better than that of your opponent.  B spent a lot of moves on the group on the left, which (aside from this unlikely kill) only netted him a dozen points or so, max.  You took a huge area in the top left, a good bottom left corner, and had a stable group on the right.
2) The only major mistake you made to this point was in abandoning your bottom middle group.  Every couple of moves, check on all your groups and those of your opponents.  Figure out which are safe and which need help.  If one of yours is weak and you don't want to sacrifice it, play to support that group.  If your groups are fine, see if you can profit from pestering any of your opponent's groups.  In this game, you had three safe groups and one weak group, but you pushed your opponent to attack the weak one.  Next game, try to keep your group safety in mind, and you may be able to prioritize where to play a bit easier.]

;B[oh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[sg]C[Chew: This move is a bit small.  M13, for example, helps wall off your potential territory.]

(;B[pj]C[Black should have played T14

Chew: Yes.  Not only would it protect him, it would threaten to kill, so you would have to respond.]

;W[ri];B[cc]C[Should I have gotten away with the sequence following this in the corner?
If not, how should black have replied to prevent the sequence?

Chew: If you mean the top left, you were correct when you guessed earlier: B had to defend at move 143, as in the variation.]

Marlwolfe [14k\]: That was a close game. Thank you for the match. ^_^]
;B[op];W[gn]C[Chew: Overall, you ended up ahead here.  You played a much better opening, but you gave up things in fights that you did not need to.  You lost the K3 group and you let B capture stones because you gave him a ko for life in the top left. The fights were tough and hard to read.  The biggest thing of the whole game was your mistake at 92.  If you kept your groups safe, you would be so far ahead that the lead would be insurmountable.  Overall, you played very well, just keep an eye out for which groups are weak, and you will do well!]
