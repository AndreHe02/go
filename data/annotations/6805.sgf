C[Dear reviewer,
First of all, thanks for reviwing my game. In this game i played black and it seems to me that i went from bad to worse since the beginning. Something went wrong in the fight and i can't get where the problem is. Please tell me where my mistake is.

Thomas

[kb\]: Hi Thomas,
My name is Kyle Blocher, 4-dan from the United States.  I'm happy to review your game.]
;B[qe];W[dp];B[po]C[[kb\]: A note about fusekis like this.  Amateurs have the freedom to play whatever fusekis they want, but if you want to improve, you need to play moves that you understand.  I hope that you've done a little bit of research about this fuseki before you played it.]
;W[de];B[cc]C[[kb\]: Black plays this move when you want to emphasize the right side.  Is that what you want?

Enclosures are all okay too.  I would play P16 in a game like this ;)]
;W[ed];B[eb]
(;W[fc];B[be];W[cf]C[I think Black should be happy with this result - you got the corner and sente.]
;B[nd]C[I saw this move in several pro games so i guess it's right

[kb\]: This kind of game is very hard to understand, even for stronger players.  This move's direction seems okay though.]
;W[qm]C[It's not the first time for me seeing this move but i can't find any dictionnary of joseki that treat about it. Can you tell me how to handle it ?

[kb\]: Just protecting the corner looks okay.]
(;B[qo]C[[kb\]: This move feels wrong - usually this aims for a very strong attack or to just protect territory.  There are so few stones on the right side, so Black can't really attack very strongly.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[[kb\]: Good];W[rn];B[ro];W[oq]
(;B[pk]C[[kb\]: This move's direction is wrong.  Playing this move aims to seal in White or to lean off it to attack another group.

Actually, the P3 stone is stronger than this White group, so you should lean off of it.]

(;W[om]C[[kb\]: Good move by White, althought just connecting at R9 and letting Black get what he wants is also okay.]
;B[no];W[mp]
(;B[qk]C[[kb\]: Too small right now];W[mm]C[[kb\]: Now Black is in trouble.]
;B[mo]C[[kb\]: Pushing like this is certainly bad, it lets White get fourth line territory for free...  but Black has little choice.]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[kp];B[nl];W[ol];B[ok];W[nm];B[ko];W[jp];B[kl]
C[was this move too much ?

[kb\]: Yes.

So far White has gotten about 15+ points on the lower side, while Black got about 10 points on the top right side.  It was Black's corner to begin with :(]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[km];B[jm];W[lk];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[nj]
(;B[nk]C[[kb\]: Why bother connecting this stone?  You can't kill this group.  Enclose it and let him live small.]
;W[mh]C[[kb\]: Now White is out again.  Black missed his chance.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[rj];B[rk];W[pi]C[i didn't see this move, so i guess i had to protect sooner

[kb\]: This is because of O9.];B[pj];W[qi];B[oi];W[ph];B[oh]

;B[ql];W[pn];B[rm];W[lh];B[kh];W[mf]C[[kb\]: White should take the ko.]
;B[me];W[rl];B[mj];W[ni]
(;B[li];W[oe];B[mk];W[od]C[now i think the trade is better for white

[kb\]: Yes, because it looks like the variation from move 85, but White captured some of Black's central stones.]
;B[qc]C[[kb\]: Heavy move.  What does it threaten?];W[rd];B[qd]
;W[pc];B[qb];W[le]C[[kb\]: White found a good cutting point.]
;B[ke];W[ld];B[kd]
(;W[mc];B[lc];W[md];B[mb];W[nc];B[nb]C[a big mistake

[kb\]: Only if you don't follow up.];W[ne];B[pb]C[[kb\]: You saved the Black stones but at what cost.]

(;B[fm]C[[kb\]: The center points are not so large, it's better to save your stones.]
