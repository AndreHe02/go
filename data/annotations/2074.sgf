C[Ankh:
Here, I play as Black, and end up winning by only 0.5., though the meaning
of the result is muddled by a few tactical errors on either side. My concer=
n centers mostly on my strategic/global approach to the game., and the matt=
er of invasion and attack, which I have some difficulty with, though I seem=
 to need imprevement in all areas.];B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp]

:: I think it is a good idea here to play high to 'protect' the right side.
Another good idea would be to play low (see variation to this node) to put =
some pressure on the two wide stones and make territory towards the right b=
y chasing the white group. I think the black stones to the left are a bit t=
oo far apart for this to work nicely, though.

[Thomas: Very good idea! Another good idea would have been to protect the invasion-point a with b or playing c.\]]

Bad. I  think that I have seen this work, but the nearby white stones creat=
e a problem and this gets messy. How should I have differently treated this=
?
D12?

:: I don't see what reason would be behind D12.
This sequence doese work. Playing B8 you want to gain influence towards the=
 outside. If you played D8 you would like to gain territory.
If you chose a line you must stick to that, of course. In actual play you l=
eave it. I.e. you switch from gaining influence to gaining territory...]

:: Here you switch to territory - risking to get the lone black stone cut w=
hich would make two weak groups.];W[al]LB[cm:a]C[

:: Perhaps instead of taking, white could have played D8 to capture the lon=
e black stone. The black group above is still subject to chase afterwards.

[thomas I would prefer white c7 instead of d8, but don´t ask me why :)\]]
;B[dl]C[Ankh: Are E5, D12 better? Which one, if so?


:: Neither. Instead of E5, I'd suggest E6. Instead of D12, I'd suggest F10.=
 Why? Those diagonal moves like E5 and D12 give the opponent room to attack=
 by cutting or threatening to.

[po:b][pb:c][lc:d][ek:e][ep:f]C[[thomas: a very bad move, much too small at this stage. anyway the game is very difficult for black after the catastrophe in the bottom left corner. big moves now would be one of a-d.

;W[ep];B[gq]TR[aj][bj][cj][ck][dl][dm]C[Is something bigger?


:: Well, perhaps not bigger, but more urgent? ;-)
The stones to the left is quite weak and needs reinforcement. This is what =
you should think of before making 'big' moves.

Besides, since The white group around here is absolutely alive, G3 does not=
 attack. It's an endgame-move, rather.
[thomas: remind the proverb: stay away from thickness!\]];W[ek]
LB[ef:a]C[[thomas white is leading and this is enouth for winning, but this peep seems a little small to me, because the two stones are not important. May be an indirect attack with a or so would be better\]]

[thomas: this move is also very small. after a white move at or near a the game would be as good as over\]]

:: Here you will have to decide what group you would like to rescue. The on=

[thomas: dont try to rescue this two stones. its easy to imagine: white captures, black must add another move at a or b, and white can play c, which is unbearable for black\]]

 fail to see a life pattern for this group until MUCH later. Both B and W
tenuki away.

but I find it difficult to be compromising in attack. What follows seems
to be bad for me.

C[Ankh: This
move and W's next two seem to help me enormously. Is there some other reaso=

why they are played?


:: The two white stones cannot really escape. Most likely white wanted to g=
ain something still...

[thomas: first, before black playes a, white should play b-d\]]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[op]C[


:: ... now white gained some outside influence. But the group is very weak,=
 of course.];B[nq]TR[pn]LB[no:a][nn:b]C[


:: 'Play away from thickness'. Playing too close to stones you'd like to ca=
pture gives the opponent the chance to capture and rescue his own stones. B=
etter play a bit away.

Also, the cut at Q6 would be interesting to play. White will then have to e=
xpand to the left while black takes the right edge.


[thomas: blacks only chance to win is to kill the white group. So this normally very bad move isnt so bad. I would prefer a or b, but of course white cannot really be killed.\]]

;B[pm];W[pn];B[ll]LB[nm:a]C[Ankh: I don't know what to do here except to atte=
mpt to surround.


:: Well, I don't know what you want to do by surrounding? Seems a bit diffi=
cult to kill the group. And M8 is a move with the sole purpose of killing i=
t since it does not do anything else, it appears to me.
So what I would like to point out here is that you should make moves that h=
ave several meanings not just one. Most of the times this will be attacking=
 (threatening to kill) and making territory.

[thmoas: blacks only chance to win is to kill the white group, which seemes impossible anyway. But this move allowes white to make a second eye too easy. The peep at a seemes mandatory\]]

;W[qk]C[


:: Black's game now actually collapses.];B[rj]C[


:: Now you crawl away with those stones.];W[qj]C[

:: Instead of crawling with you white should have jumped in front of your s=
tones. Like R12. It connects towards the bottom group or gets out into the =
center while attacking the top corner in the meantime.];B[ri]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[nj]TR[pk]C[


::  The next moves do not really gain anything for both players. Better pla=
y somewhere else and don't stick too much to stones played.

Here, e.g., if white wanted to capture Q9 she would still have to invest at=
 least one stone. In the meantime you could, again, play somewhere else.
[thomas: yes, this is a very small move, the q9-stone isnt important, just 2 points, not more. black has to invade the upper left moyo\]]
;W[oj]LB[pb:a][lc:b][nr:c]C[[thomas: too small. why rescue two points while there are much bigger moves on the board? a or b or an invasion in the upper left, or even c is much bigger as you can easily see\]]
;B[nk];W[ok];B[nr]LB[pb:a][hc:b]C[Gote, but where else to play. To not seems danger=
ous if I want to build out into the center.



:: Where else to play? The top edge of the board looks huge for white. You =
could still bentrate from the right side. Pay attention to white's strength=
 on the left.

[thomas: surely a big move, but its just an endgame move and a little slow. a for example is bigger, but an invasion into the upper left seems the only way for black to win this game, around b\]]

;W[mm]C[[thomas: also tooo small\]];B[ho]C[

:: Considering the top side of the board this move seems not to be in the d=
irection of play. It does not secure the stones to the left above and does =
not make territory

[thomas: this is also a very small endgame move. black is strong in this area so he dont need to add another stone\].
[thomas: here my comments end; if white wont let the black stones at the left side, which are really dead, he cannot loose this game\]]

 better, but somehow I've neglected the top all this while, and the shape
