;B[pd]C[Lambrechts: I play white. Both Hopefull and me are 16K* on IGS. I added some  comments to say how I understand the game and on some errors that I figured out  after the game]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[nc];B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc]
C[lambrechts: I think that Black-11 at S17 is too timid.

Perhaps b doesn't want to start a fight right now. One reason for this might be that, with the corner enclosure in the upper left, b wants sente to extend down the left side.]
;W[oc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dj]C[B loves this result. The corner enclosure at the top radiates power down the entire left side.]
;W[iq]C[ Lambrechts : I played (18) at J3  to stabilize my group and make some  territory but maybe R10 to avoid the extension of the black gtoup is better ?

Hard to say. I would favor a move more like r12 if worried about the b group extending. The big problem at this point, however is b's power on the left. J3 is a prudent move to compensate with strength on the bottom.]
;B[qn];W[pl]C[A good choice to break up b's power on the right.]
;B[on];W[np];B[qp];W[qq];B[po];W[op];B[qi];W[nl];B[mn];W[rp]
C[ Lambrechts I guess that 30 at S4 is a bit small. I wanted to take the corner  and remove the basis of the black group to release pressure on my stones O8-Q8.

Not a bad play. W's stones o8-q8 are fairly weak and must look to escape unless stablized.]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[ql];W[qm];B[rm]C[Interesting choice of atari. Obviously giving up the ko to make a more-solid base.]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk]C[lambrechts: I think that my move (40) in S9 was overplay because Black may cut  in Q9. Black Q10 was maybe more correct ?

A dangerous move, yes. B need not follow with t6 as was done because the ko still exists. If w q10, b can connect underneath and the nature of the game changes dramatically.]
;B[sn];W[pj];B[pi];W[ni]C[lambrechts: I guess that (44) is overplay again because  Black can play P10;  therefore  White P10 seems now better to me ?

Hmm. I do not think b p10 would be fruitful here because w cuts at p11, trapping b inside w's little group. W's o11 is a fair move.]
;B[ic]C[This move hurts w and uses the power of the corner enclosure along the top now.]
;W[dg]C[W needs to start this invasion now, but is attacking into very solid surroundings.]
;B[cg]C[B's response, however, betrays that the strength of the position is not appreciated.

I would have attached at the shoulder of d13 with c12, inviting w c13. Then a capping move or a move to f12 pressures w's stone while expanding b territory on the side.]
;W[df];B[cf]C[Following w here is a mistake, allowing w's influence towards the center to grow.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[dd];B[dc];W[de];B[di]C[Lambrechts : my move 54 was kikachi : Black had to play C15, no ?

Or be prepared to follow the peep at c15 with b16, allowing w to the side and using the opportunity to pressure w with a move like g14.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[cc];W[bf];B[bc];W[ae];B[bg];W[gc];B[gb]
C[Another b mistake. f16 would pressure this invading stone while simultaneously pressuring the w wall on the d line.]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[hb];B[hc]C[Having given up this stone, b needs to fight back with a move like f15.]
;W[gd];B[ac]C[ Lambrechts: if Black does not play A17 maybe the group is only alive by ko ?

Hmm. No, I think b can live well enough without a17, but a17 certainly ensures life. But b should be worrying about attacking now, not just surviving.]
;W[lc];B[ke]C[This stone seems to just float out here...no real connection to either b's stones on top or right; also no apparent purpose.

b's power is on the left. The w stones in the upper left threaten that power but are not yet settled. A move more like h14 or g12 makes better use of b's strength.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[hd];W[ge];B[he];W[hf];B[ie];W[je];B[if]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[ii];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg]C[B is aimlessly running now....]
;W[le];B[mg];W[og];B[of];W[ng];B[nf];W[pg]C[W n14 would be natural here]
;B[qg];W[li];B[ji];W[kk]C[Lambrechts: with this move I wanted also to begin to attack the black group at  Q16.

Worthwhile, but I think you would be better off continuting attacking the b group above. While you are unlikely to capture it wholly, the struggle should leave you with a live group in the upper left and a stronger attack on the b group at q6 later.]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[en]C[Lambrechts I dont know the purpose of Black 103 at E6. I guess that black J10  is better to press the white groups D15-G15 which is not yet alived.

This move is good for b, but mis-timed. It expands the territory on the left largely. However, it should come earlier in the game or in conjunction with an attack on w's upper left group.]
;W[ij];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki];W[mh];B[lg];W[kj];B[jh];W[lp]C[Lambrechts: M4 was the only reasonable move that I could think about to attack  the black group. I guess that White T8 is too early now.

Also w t8 isn't necessary as it only completes one eye for that group. Better would be to take the ko at r4, depriving b of the eye at s6 and demanding t8. But m4 is a good move.]
;B[me]C[Lambrechts: I think that Black 113 at N15 is very small and moreover Black  needed to reply to White 112 at M4 because the right low black group is weak.

I agree, but the cut at n14 is very troublesome for b. While he might be able to make a second eye at the top, it would be  a struggle.]
;W[sl]C[This move is unecessary to capture b's group. A move like L6 would be better.]
;B[sm];W[sk]C[Lambrechts I played 116 at T9 because I feel that this white group would be  safer before the attack.

T9 is also an unecessary move. b cannot get an eye or connect by capturing t8.]
;B[qp];W[rq]C[One possibility is to take L6 and fight the ko. If b wins, he lives in the corner for relativley few points while a w follow-up of g6 secures large w territory on the bottom.]

;B[fl]C[Once again, b is running without much aim....];W[em]
;B[el];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[ck]C[Lambrechts : here I guess that Black 147 should have better play F10 or  something like that instead of C9  to save the big group and then try to live in  the lower right corner with the other group.

I concur.];W[ek];B[fj]C[If b is going to do this, the extension should b at g10.]

;W[ll];B[lj];W[lk]C[Lambrechts: White 62 is a  mistake:  I should connect in N11 and  nothing can  happen.]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[oi];B[ok];W[oj];B[mi];W[nk];B[nh];W[oh]
;B[fi];W[gh];B[gi];W[hj];B[cp];W[bq]C[Lambrechts: White advance is huge now. Therefore there ane no need for more  comments now. Thank you for reviewing :-)

b's only hope of living with this sprawling group across the middle is in making a capture. Best prospect of that is by advancing into w's group in the upper left. Still. Small hope.]
;B[eo];W[ep];B[fo]C[A too-obvious move aimed at the cut at g6. b needs the connection at d5 to survive that....]

;W[lb];B[ib];W[re];B[rf];W[qf];B[gj];W[sf]C[Lambrechts: huge white mistake but the game is already over.

No mistake if w is prepared to fight the ko at r5 for b's life.]

C[Lambrechts: I just figure out that  the group was not yet alived !

That was your mistake. :)];B[so];W[qo])
