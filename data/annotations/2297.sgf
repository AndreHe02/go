C[Thanks in advance for the review !

No "catastrophe" in this game (I played white and lose), so any help will be welcomed !

Hello Serge,

I will try my best to give some advice. I am sorry but I am not very good at the endgame, which was eventually important in this game also. But there were some issues in the fuseki and middle game which might interest you.

The main points in this game were:

1) Black got a good start, but white developed quickly in the later fuseki, and the game began to look good for white.
2) White got a very good attack on the black stones on the left side, but missed his chance to make territory, which turned the game for black.
3) White lived luckily in the top right, which made the game even again.
4) Black played a better endgame, which decided the game in his favor.

SQ[jp]C[
This move goes directly into blacks framework. There is nothing wrong about this, although more peaceful moves at 'A' or 'B' are possible in my opinion. 'C' seems to have been played in professional games.

When playing this kind of move, you must not expect too much, because you are operating in black's sphere of influence. The marked stone is of considerable assistance to black.]
;B[oo]LB[pl:A]C[
A pincer at 'A' would have been more dynamic, and co-operate with the black stone at the side. Attaching here could make black over-concentrated. However..]

(;W[pp]C[
Hane at 'A' is more common, see variation. This move is not bad either.]
;B[op];W[qq];B[oq];W[pr]LB[pn:A]C[This lets black build a wall that is too good? Also the marked stones need more liberties, so I recommend coming out at A instead.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[ql]SQ[pd][jp]C[White got the corner and sente, but I think this situation is better for black. Now the marked stones are smiling.]
;W[ol];B[pj];W[jd]SQ[ol][pm]C[Coming out with the marked stones is not very grand, because the black stones on both sides are not in danger.
This white move is definitely a big point.];B[or];W[qr];B[nj]
C[Black is trying to make you save the stones. Dont do that.]
;W[gq]LB[fq:A]C[
This is good, a black move at A would be very big.];B[cn]LB[cj:A]
[dj:B]C[A splitting move at A or B would seem better for black.]
;W[dj]C[This is good, white is developing fast. Now the game begins to look even again.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[en];W[go]LB[en:A]C[White got to play exactly the point he needs. Black is not able to attack the white corner effectively anymore. Black A was not too good.]
;B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[hm]LB[ho:A]C[This leaves a cut at A, which could be trouble later]
;B[io]C[Perhaps black should strengthen the left-side stones and leave the cut as aji. White is happy to connect here.]
;W[ho];B[jm]C[Now the black stones are getting weaker and weaker, while white has nothing to worry about. Time to attack.]
;W[jl]C[This is good. Separating the black stones while not helping the weak stones to get stronger.]
;B[kl];W[jk];B[gl];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[jn]C[This is kikashi, but..]
;B[kn]C[White shouldnt answer this directly because he loses sente.]

(;W[in]LB[hj:A]C[Answering at A seems better. See variation.]
;B[mk];W[jo];B[ko];W[ip];B[jq]C[
Blacks territory is not too big, and never was. Both could have played tenuki at any time.]
;W[cl]C[
This move is much bigger than any of the previous moves from around #51. White is glad to have gotten sente.

White gets some territory at the side, and attacks the black stones at the same time.]
;B[bq];W[br];B[cp];W[dq];B[ar];W[bs];B[do];W[bm];B[gj];W[dm]
;B[dn];W[bn];B[bo]C[This is wrong. There are no eyes in the corner anyway.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[fo];B[fn];W[hk];B[gk]C[
Black played sloppily and white got a very good attack on the black stones. White should now make territory at the left side while attacking.]
;W[eh]LB[gh:A]C[
This is good. White is beginning to make a large territory, while black still has no eyes. A more aggressive move would be at A.]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[fh];W[fg];B[gh];W[kh]LB[ih:A]C[
A seems more vital.];B[gg];W[ff];B[dk];W[ck];B[ej];W[ek]C[
This is a terrible mistake. White absolutely should play at A. Are you trying to kill the black stones OR are you trying to win the game? The territory at the side would not be small, even though black could live.]
;B[di];W[dl];B[ei];W[dh];B[ci];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[bf]C[
Now black got to ruin whites left side, and is leading the game. Letting black to the side was a big mistake.]

LB[kb:B][qc:A][og:C]C[This is big. Black is leading a little. The big points are: invading at A, defending the top side at B and reducing the right side.]
;W[og];B[jb];W[jc]LB[ic:A]C[A is better?];B[ib];W[kb]LB[qc:A]
C[This does not work. White should have invaded the corner at A instead.]
;B[lb];W[lc];B[ka];W[kc];B[mb];W[md];B[nd];W[me];B[ne]LB[rd:A]

Now the corner invasion is more difficult, perhaps at A.];W[nf]

This is a good cut. White needs to be careful.];W[mg];B[lf]

This does not work. See variation.];B[lg];W[lh]LB[mh:A]C[Black should play at A now.]

(;B[jg];W[jh];B[ig];W[hg]LB[he:A]C[You are trying too hard. The black stones cannot be caught. Just defend at A.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[ie];B[ih];W[nh]C[
White is lucky to have played here.];B[pf]C[
Now invading the corner is almost impossible. This is good for black.]

C[
Playing A would kill white. White got lucky here.];B[rd];W[sb]
C[
This was a lucky result. Santa Claus is coming to town. Now the game seems even again. The endgame is beginning.]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[
Black played this to get some aji. This does not look very promising, but white needs to be careful.]

;B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[bc];B[gb];W[fa];B[le]LB[ir:A][os:B]C[White should ignore this and play at A or B, for example. That is much bigger.]
;W[ld];B[hr];W[gr];B[iq];W[hq];B[ir];W[rk];B[qk]LB[rj:A]C[Just play A, so black does not get to the corner so easily.]

White lives in gote, this is painful.];B[qj];W[qi];B[mi];W[mh]

From this point on, there is not much to say about the endgame. Black is leading, and if the players are of equal strength it should stay that way.]
