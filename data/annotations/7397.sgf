C[Hi.
Thanks for your time spent reviewing this game.

I was playing black in this game and have lost by 11.5 points.

Aside from obvious mistakes, i'm really interested in ideas on how i could've expanded my territory and influence more efficiently, as i feel that forms i'm using are quite heavy and slow while still leaving possibilities of invasion.

REVIEWER: Pete, 4k AGA/KGS

General feedback for Black: read out some of the capturing races. Also try to find worse-case secnarios with immediate atari moves by the opponent and see if you are still alive and how many points it costs. You will then find that you can tenuki. 

General feedback for White: Avoid playing on second line unless you are forced to or the game is very close to the end. You also played a bunch of moves which were meant to pretect a perfectly safe group - those moves lost senta.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd]LB[ec:A][ed:B][pd:D][cf:C]C[REVIEWER: the thing to always keep in mind about the 3-4 point is that it has its week and its strong side. In the upper left corner the top side (around A and B) is the weak side for White. Black is likely to aproach on this side (typical josekis start with Black at A or B). Black is not like to begin aproach to the corner at C - that is White's strong side. 

When Black approaches at A or B, the situation works out well for him because of the stone at D. See the variation. So to avoid this, White could play the first move in the corner at D17 instead.]

(;B[qj];W[bc]LB[ec:A][fc:B][ed:C]C[REVIEWER: Very strange move on White's part. If White wants to secure the corner, the optimal way to do it is to play at A (regardless of all other stones on the board). White at B or C are also possibilities but they are not as strong enclosures as the one at A.]
;B[pf]LB[co:A][do:B]C[REVIEWER: Not a bad move locally but I think Black might be better off preventing White from enclosing the lower right corner. Black can start a joseki at A or B.]
;W[cr]LB[co:A]C[REVIEWER: Same comment as for White 6. Move at A would be a lot better.]
;B[jp]LB[jd:A][cj:C][ck:B][qo:D]SQ[qj]C[REVIEWER: Good move. Moves at A or B or C would also be good. 
If Black gets to play at D any time soon, he should be very happy. He will get double-wing formation with the marked stones and the corner enclosure.]
;W[jq]LB[jd:A][cj:C][ck:B]C[REVIEWER: A bit too early for such close-combat fight. Both players should first try to get corner enclosures and extensions first (that's the Go theory at least). Moves at A or B or C are better for White (especially B and C - works well with both of White's corners).]

(;B[po]LB[jp:A]C[REVIEWER: Not responding to White's attack might not be good idea. Black could sacrafice the stone at A but this early in a game such decision would basically indicate that playing at A in the first place was not a good idea. In general one should always first consider responding to attachments like this. See variation.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qq]LB[pp:A]SQ[jp]C[REVIEWER: Black's response at A is good. It says: I want the influence, you can take the corner. The question is now: will Black be able to utilize the marked stone to get some of that influence and convert it to territory. If Black doesn't eventually respond to White's attachment and allows White to play there first, the influence of the wall will be reduced a by a lot.]

(;B[qn]LB[qo:B][qr:A]C[REVIEWER: This move by Black is way to timid. See variations. 
Moves at A and B hit on the head of two white stones (which is a Go proverb, actually).]
;W[pr]
(;B[nq]C[sklx: up until this point i was trying to produce influence on lower right part of the board, though i feel like i've spent too many stones on doing so.

REVIEWER: I would not say Black spent too many moves yet. But because of this move, Black allowed White to keep pushing Black around a bit .. this is what caused Black to be over-concentrated here.]
;W[or]LB[nq:A]C[REVIEWER: White utilizes Black's loose move at A.]

(;B[oq]LB[mp:A][np:B]SQ[jp]C[REVIEWER: Empty triangle. Blacks' move would be much better at A. See variaton. Bamboo at B is also better but it does not connect with the marked stone as well.]
;W[nr];B[kq]C[REVIEWER: good timing on this move.];W[kp]C[REVIEWER: White wants to start a fight it seems. The only problem is that Black is much stronger in this area and has the next move...]
;B[lq]LB[ko:A]C[REVIEWER: Good response.];W[jr]
(;B[ko]C[REVIEWER: Might be a bit over-protective. See variation.]

(;W[kr]LB[ip:A]C[REVIEWER: White would be better off playing at A. See variation.]

(;B[jc]LB[ck:A]C[REVIEWER: Definitely good idea to leave the lower right corner and go to one of the remaining big moves on the board. The thing to consider is: Which of the two remaining sides is a bigger move. What if White plays on left side at A like in the variation...

To some extend which side Black decides to go on is a question of personal style and what Black knows about White's style and how the game is going so far. The move up to says "I'll take my stuff, you take your stuff" ... more peaceful. the move the left side says "I'll take my stuff later, but I want to prevent you from taking your stuff first" ... more of a fight invite :)]

(;W[lp]C[REVIEWER: Ladder doesn't work for White obviously so White must be trying to connect very badly...]
;B[mp];W[lr];B[lo]C[REVIEWER: White stones are already connected. No need to make another move there.]
;W[mr]LB[mr:A]C[REVIEWER: This move is worth at most 1 point (and that's only if Black gets to play at A first). Playing on the center of the left side is probably worth 20 or 30 points.]

(;B[qc]C[REVIEWER: This move is too slow and over-protective of territory. The left side is still more important. See variation.]
;W[cj]C[REVIEWER: White sees the left side as the clear oportunity for territory.]
;B[kk]LB[ej:C][jj:A][hp:B]TR[jc][jp]C[sklx: not sure if this move was a reasonable one. is L10 or N10 better?

REVIEWER: Frankly, I would have either played even furhter (at A for example) or assumed another strategy: not giving White the opportunity to take sante and instead pushing into White's territory with a move at B. Another possibility is to try to push White down onto third line with a move like C. As the exchange of moves develops, Black might find that the encosure of the center happens naturally.

The move in the real game (at the circle-marked stone) seems too close to the lower portion of the board and too far from the slightly weaker upper portion. That's why I think move at A would be more balanced. It would also nicely align with the two triangle-marked stones.]

(;W[gm]C[REVIEWER: Odd move. Does not reduce Black's territory or influence and does not build much of those for White either.]

(;B[il]C[REVIEWER: OK but ... see variations on this move and the next one.]

(;W[gg]LB[cl:A]SQ[cj][gm]C[REVIEWER: White is trying to build its own big moyo but the 3 White stones hardly can secure it. Black can easily invade / reduce the whole thing.  If I were black I would probably invade at A.]
;B[kf]LB[mc:C][je:B][jf:A]C[REVIEWER: Similar comment. Black does not need to draw back as much. Move at A would be better and secure more of the moyo. Move at B is also possible. The thing to keep in mind is that White can still try some funny stuff by invading at around C (it will be hard to survive but White could try to form a Ko or just complicate things.]
;W[jh];B[kh]C[REVIEWER: Good response. White cannot hane...]

(;W[jj];B[kj];W[ji]LB[ki:A]C[REVIEWER: This is one of the mistakes I'm sure you are already aware of. Better to respond to this peep at A.]
;B[jg];W[ki];B[li];W[jk];B[jl];W[kl]
(;B[ll]C[REVIEWER: this definitely added fuel to the fire. See variation.]
;W[lh]C[sklx: starting from here i have a problems keeping groups alive and, more importantly, keeping opponent from building solid walls while threatening my groups and reducing my influence]

(;B[lg]LB[kg:A]C[REVIEWER: Yeah, this move would be better at A. See variation.]
;W[lj];B[km];W[lk];B[mh];W[kl];B[kk];W[kj]LB[kj:A][nj:B]C[REVIEWER: Not needed. Black cannot play at A to cut white off. White should play a move that cuts more of Blacks territory (like at B)]
;B[kl];W[nj]C[REVIEWER: Moves that follow until the next comment are natural progression of one side trying to go deeper and the othe side trying to prevent that from happening.]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[mi];W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[oi]C[REVIEWER: Yeah, good move.]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[oj];B[pi];W[om];B[pl];W[pm]
(;B[pk]LB[qm:A]C[REVIEWER: trying to save those 2 stones is a mistake as it gives White oportunity to push in at A as you have seen. Best thing is to protect the side (see the variations) and if Black can get sante, start reducing/invading the big White areas.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[qm]
(;B[nn]C[REVIEWER: No need to try to form a second eye yet. The Black group is very strong and can first push through into White's left side. See variation.]
;W[rl];B[nm];W[ol];B[qi]LB[si:B][nm:A]C[REVIEWER: Exactly .. Black forced himself to connect and allowed White to make monkey jump into B.]
;W[rn]LB[si:A]C[REVIEWER: Monkey jump at A is more valuable and keeps sente.]
;B[ro]LB[fc:C][fd:B][cl:D][co:E][hp:A]C[REVIEWER: Instead of playing here, Black should either reduce White's area by playing at A or perhaps expand his own framework by playing at B or C (or invade at D or E .. for might be best to build support starting with A before such invasion).]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[mq];B[he]LB[fc:A][gc:B][fd:C]C[REVIEWER: This move by Black is OK but normally one tries to sercure side-territory first. Moves at A, B, and C are better because they are worth 20 points or more (if Black doesn't go there and secure another 10 points, White will).]

(;B[mo]C[REVIEWER: Over-protective. The Black group is safe. See variations.]
;W[fd]C[REVIEWER: big move by White.];B[gc]C[REVIEWER: yes, good move - Black needs to reduce White's side territory and try to expand his own.]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[fe]LB[cg:A]C[REVIEWER: territory lines up top have been secured but now Black has less of a chance to invade the area around A. The door of opportunity is slowly closing.]
;B[gf];W[ge]SQ[gc][gd]C[REVIEWER: might be worth for Black to sacrafice the two markes stones in exchange for being able to poke into White area more... see variation.]

(;B[hg]SQ[fc][fd][fe][ff][fg][fh]C[REVIEWER: this move is OK but allows White to solidify his marked wall which secures the territory on the left-upper side. Black hasn't gained anything except for security of some of the stones that are in contact with that wall.]
;W[ff];B[hf];W[gh];B[hh];W[hi]C[sklx: the opponent continues on building a nice thick walls. and i absolutely don't know what to do with it.]

(;B[ii]C[REVIEWER: Black cannot cut the bamboo joint. White responds, stays safe and gains sente. Bad for Black. See variation.]
;W[ij];B[ih];W[fj]C[sklx: starting from here i try to expand as much as possible into opponent's territory

REVIEWER: good idea. White has terrible shape with 4 sente cutting points. It is good to utlize those weak points as Black did.]
;B[ej];W[fi];B[el];W[dk];B[fm];W[dl]
(;B[gn]SQ[dk][dl][dm][dn][do][dp][dq]C[REVIEWER: Going after those 3 stones now will gain maybe 6 points, right? If Black allows White to solidify the marked wall, behind it sits about 20 points or more. If Black can continue reducing White territory in sente, he should do that first.]
;W[em]LB[hn:B][fp:C][hp:A]C[REVIEWER: White wisely decides to forget about this 3 stones for now... they might come handy later. If White can get a move at A, that threatens to resque the 3 stones. So Black might respond at B. Then White can play at C and secure 4-th line territory at the bottom - big.]

(;B[hn];W[dm]
(;B[im]C[REVIEWER: This move is not necessary. White stones could not have escaped. You need to read those sequences out.]
;W[cg]LB[gq:A]C[REVIEWER: This White area is already secure. Better move for White would be at A to secure some territory at the bottom. Black move at A is also big.]
;B[fb]LB[gq:A]C[REVIEWER: too early for this move. Black also lost sente here. Move at A would be better.]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[bn]LB[eo:A][gp:C][gq:B]C[REVIEWER: Very strange move. Never play on second line unless you are in end-game or you are forced to do so. White would be better off playing at A or B or even C.]
;B[ea];W[da];B[fa];W[dc];B[fo]LB[eo:C][fp:A][gq:B]C[REVIEWER: Black could go deeper. Very safe to go at A, B or C.]
;W[gq]C[REVIEWER: Good move by White - secures lower territory at least a little bit.]

(;B[hp]LB[do:A][hp:B]C[REVIEWER: This is a gote move. Beter to try to jump in at A and force White to defend its territory first. Move at B only secured 2 points or so. See variation.]
