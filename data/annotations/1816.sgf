C[First of all I want to thank you for your review!
This is a game played on nngs between ronin as black and me, elric, as white in march 2002.
elric 5K vs. ronin 5K
We couldn´t play it to the end because black forfeits on time after getting 5 min. extra.
My main question is: "where didn´t I play from the right direction and which moves are too local orientated"

Forfun (ff) - Thanks for making this game available for analysis.  It was quite interesting.  The thing that struck me the most about W's play is that you had quite a lot of plans and pushed throughout the game to carry them out.  This was sometimes good and sometimes less good.  Especially it seems that when your plans to not come out as you intend you automatically assume that the result is unsatisfactory.  It is very important to be able to judge the board calmly.  Who is doing better?  Who has more territory? Who has better potential?  Based on this you should fit your plans to the situation.   Of course there were individual moves for each side that I thought could have been better.  I have tried to point some of them out and hope that this advice is useful.  However, I really think that W can gain the most right now from working on a more objective assessment of the board.  W made some very nice choices at several points.  However, in the end you got into trouble by underestimating your overall success up to that point.  This came close to throwing the game away - which can be the most disappointing way to lose, right? :-)]
;B[pq];W[qd];B[cp];W[cd]C[My Idea of the opening was to invite B to the upper site, making shape at the upper corners, getting profit at the right site and invade black at the lower left corner.

ff - This seems like a lot to expect from this position.  Having an expectation for every corner assumes that your opponent has none.  In an even game if you achieve your aims in two corners, you should expect that your opponent will determine the overall result in the others.  In addition, the way you achieve your aims in one corner may force you to change your expectation in the others.

If you have too many expectations, you may not be able to judge the position in an objective way.  This can lead to overplaying the position - which happened to some extent in this game.]
;B[od];W[mc];B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[re];B[of]C[ff - This is an unusual choice for Black.  Most common is O15, looking to press down on the upper side white stone with M16.]
;W[pg];B[ed];W[ec]C[ff - I think that a pincer at H16 or J16 would be more reasonable here.  W should want to play against B's position on the right which has no eye shape yet.  Attaching at E17 gives B the upper hand on the top.]
;B[dc]C[ff - This is a very aggressive choice which seems unnecessary here.  The usual F17 looks better.]
;W[dd];B[fc];W[eb];B[fb];W[ee];B[fd];W[db];B[kc]C[ff - With the wall that B has built on the left, this should probably be at M16 or else a high pincer at L16.]
;W[ld]C[ff - This looks perfect here and puts B's stones on the right on the spot.]
;B[me]C[ff - B realizes that there is a problem.  However, B should push at least once at L16 before moving out from the right.  W is very happy to push B down along the top.]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[ie];B[ic];W[jf]C[ff - W has done a good job pushing B to the left.  B is now over-concentrated and has no compensation for the big corner that W made by capturing the sacrifice stone at D17.  This W move at K14 is very tight.  It would probably be better at L13 which would coordinate better with a later W move around O12, surrounding the upper right B stones.  Note that a B play at H15 would have no meaning in the current position so W can play more loosely here.  In any case W is off to a good start.]
;B[qo]C[ff - A natural and big play.  It assumes that the B upper right can take care of itself.  In a sense it takes some of the pressure off the upper right from a distance because it makes it difficult for W to make territory on the right while attacking B.]
;W[og]C[ff - After B R5 this is not an interesting approach for W.  By pushing directly, W helps B defend.  W should probably leave this area for now and see how the rest of the game develops before deciding how best to attack.  W's attention should be directed to the bottom side and bottom left corner now - E4 is the usual move here.

Note that it is not so easy to attack these B stones because B can play N16, W M17, B O17 in order to make eyes at any time.  Therefore W needs a way to cut B off in the center as part of some other action in order to seriously threaten B.  Or W needs to arrange things so that cutting off the center (followed by B making life) is valuable in itself.]
;B[mg]C[ff - This should be at O13 which is perfect shape and would justify B's earlier play at N15.]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[qk]C[ff - This move is small and uninteresting.  W should recognize that after B R5 the right side is not particularly valuable for either side.]
;B[jp]C[ff - Compare K4 to R9.  Just by eye the difference is very large.]
;W[eq]C[ff - Playing a low approach to a komoku stone like C4 in a situation where a stone is already in place around K4 is too aggressive.  This should be at E4.]

(;B[eo]C[ff - This move has to be at D3 to make W heavy.  In this game since W is stronger on the left than B is, there is no reasonable follow up for B.  In effect, B gives W a free move to settle the bottom stone.]
;W[dp]C[ff - W sets out to settle the bottom quickly.  This is a very good idea in this position.]
;B[do];W[cq];B[ep];W[dq];B[fq];W[fr]
(;B[bp]C[ff - B has two stones in question:C4 and F3.  This looks like the wrong choice.  There is no good follow up on the left.  The key question right now is how much B can make on the lower side, having played the excellent point at K4 earlier.]
;W[gq]C[ff - Now B gets nothing on the lower side.  K4 has become worthless.]
;B[dj]C[Here I wasn´t sure if my next move (F4) was best. But I thougt :"If my cornergroup comes out, I will not
have too many problems to live and there would be more possibilities to shorten the black gain on both sides."

ff - This is exactly the right way to think about it in my opinion.  Capturing the stone makes W thick across the board and seems to put W firmly ahead in the game.]
;W[fp];B[cg]C[Now I had to deside if I have to invade at the left side or the lower right corner.
Because I was timid about a black move at G6, I decided to invade at the left side, hoping that I can us the weakness in the black wall at C5.

I think that this was a very reasonable idea in the game.  B has given up a lot on the bottom to create the left side framework.  If W can prevent this from becoming too large, B will have little chance left.  W takes an aggressive approach but it is based on the weaknesses in the opponent's position.]
;W[dk]
(;B[cj]C[ff - This is a very submissive reply that gives W a free hand in the invasion.  See the variations.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[dm];B[em]C[ff - This and what follows just helps W.]
;W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[en];W[fk];B[gl];W[ej];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk]
C[ff - Simply doesn't work.];W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[al];W[ci]
(;B[ef]C[Right now, after black E14 was braking the ladder, I couldn't read out a good move that captures the two black stones at C+D10 and make the area between the corner and white group at the side  around there become white territory.
After all I thought playing (w) E12, (b) F15 and (w) H12 would have been better for me.
But I captured "small" (look next)

ff - Capturing right away looks much better.  The invasion has been a huge success.  If B saves his side in gote, W is fine and easily in the lead.  The variation is not as good (see notes there).]
;W[di];B[fe];W[de]C[W15 was stupid, no gain, no reason! Here I think is the base of  the center-influence for Black.
I think I should have played around G12 or G10.];B[fg];W[dl]
;B[bn];W[oq]C[After loosing not only territory but also all the posibilities for later play around there  I was a little angry about me. So I desided to in vade the lower rigt corner with the checking move,
to see what is blacks aim around there.

ff - P3 is a good move.  However, W is misjudging the situation.  W's invasion of the left has been a great success - remember that B traded the left for the bottom to start with.  W is easily ahead.]
;B[mq];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[pp];W[nq];B[lp];W[hn]C[ff - Why let B capture the stone at F7, connecting the two stones?  The W stone at F7 can easily escape.  W "forces" B to cut W into several weak groups in the next few moves.  At this point W should be thinking of how to quietly move to the end of the game.]
;B[gn];W[hm];B[gm]
(;W[jr]C[At that moment I wasn´ sure if (w) H5 would have been better.

ff - This is W's worst play of the game.  It does not threaten to connect to the stones on the right and does not support the two stones in the center.  If W had lost the game, undoubtedly this stone would have been the reason.  H5 is much better.  It connects the W stones and isolates the 3 B stones.  They can run out into the center but that would finally create the right timing for W to try a splitting attack against the stones in the top right. (see variation)]
;B[ho]C[*ronin*: addtime pls
---> addtime 5];W[go];B[io];W[jm];B[km]
(;W[nn]C[ff - The timing is wrong for this.  W should absolutely play hane at L8 before protecting here. Note that right now if B cuts at O5, W plays N5 and then N4 is sente (there is some value in K2 after all! :-)]
;B[kl];W[ik];B[hk];W[il];B[ij]C[now it becomes clear what I have thought before about the bad move at (w) D15 and the loss of posibilities
around there. Its like a bumerang kicking my mind :-(

ff - Again the situation now is the result of the plays since D15 - particularly K2 instead of H5.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[hj];B[ii];W[gk];B[hi];W[gj];B[kj]C[I´m in trouble with my upper group.]
;W[jh];B[ji]
(;W[gf]C[After I realized that (w)G14 wasnt a true threat I thought I better hade played at (w) H13.]
;B[hf];W[lg];B[kh];W[lh];B[ni]
(;W[kg]C[Here I was thinking about (w) M11 (b) L11 (w) O10. but my fear was that black would become too strong
against the right side or the invasionstones in the lower right corner, so I tried to live, where I am.]
;B[ki];W[hg];B[he];W[if]C[*ronin*: could you add time?
*ronin*: :)];B[ke]
(;W[le]C[*ronin*: need some time
Ronin was in trouble of time, he only had about 1 minute for the next 7 moves.

Here I thougt about (w)G12 to conect both white groups and get the second eye at B11 with (w)B12.

ff - G12 has a weakness that W must be prepared to handle (see variation).  It may be possible but is actually more violent than M15!]
;B[ih]C[{Game 3: Elric vs ronin : Black forfeits on time.}
*ronin*: yes it was

After black forfeits on time, we analysed that after (w) P18 (b)O17 (w)O18 (b)M18(w)N18 (b)Q18
white will not be able to make the second eye and to conect to the left group is also impossible  so that the only way for white is to play (w)N12 (b) O12 cut at (w)O13 and to fight against the black group in the corner aiming to kill them. I think it would have been sure that white would have succeed, is it true?

I also was waiting for sente hoping to get a move at (w)R6 or at (w)L6.

What do you think that I have to change in my mind to get better?
Am I tooanxious?
Or should I take more care about weak groups (am I too confident in getting alive)?

What would be your suggestion for me to get better?

Thank you very much, sincerly yours

ff -];W[mh]C[ff - W should definitely play this push since it has a big impact on the lower right besides threatening the upper left.]
;B[nh];W[ng]C[ff - The upper right is definetly in trouble.  In addition, W threatens to capture the two B cutting stones with a play at N10.]
