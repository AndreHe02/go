(;B[fc]C[hmph: I'm not sure if i was right to tenuki the bottom left corner.

Yes, you should answer the move localy. s. Var.];W[fp]C[White gets too much power now...]
;B[gq]TR[fq][ip]C[...and the marked three stones look a bit awkward.]
;W[er]C[hmph: I'm not sure if this move is needed either. Seemed slow to me.

Yes, way too slow. It's pure endgame.];B[cf];W[ee];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[dc];W[di];B[ci]LB[pj:A]C[hmph: On hindsight, it seems a little too early to me, but i was afraid white moyo would get too deep. Also i'm not sure if its the right spot to invade.

You chossed to take a corner (which was ok), so you have to face the white moyo. If you fear this moyo, you cannot take the corner.

It would be bigger to play somewhere on the right side, maybe 'A'. W has all his stones on the left 5 rows. B would be much better developed, if you played there.

W cannot really close the moyo and make territory out of it with one move. Note: You should never fight where your opponent is strong. But exactly that is what you are doing with this actual move.]

;W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[hc]C[W should push once more on the left, then turn to h17. After that w has a real moyo (nearly territory) on the left, and you have a quite weak group.]
;B[hb];W[ic];B[fj]C[Very good. This move is enourmous. It keeps w low and makes your group strong. B is far ahead now. W has <40 points on the left, and a weak group. B has only strong groups, and controls the whole board.]
;W[ek];B[ie]LB[ib:A]C[Too direct or aji-keshi. Still a move on the right side seems to be best. There is no way to really attack this group as long as w has 'A'.]
;W[hd];B[gf];W[ib];B[gb];W[je];B[mc]C[Much too aggressive. 43 moves later you wonder why you have so many weak groups to look after. Here is the reason: You try to kill something which is not killable.]

C[hmph: After white's niext move i thought i should have p layed near  A instead. But i thought the marked group needed defending, too.plz enlighten me.

You are right, this is a real problem now. The reasons for the problems lie in the last 50 moves, as I have tried to show you. The marked group needs definitly support, too.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[md];B[me];W[nd];B[nc]C[Another group to defend...]
;W[ne]LB[od:A]C[hmph: Would A have been a better move?

For w? No, I think this move is just fine. 'A' is aji-keshi.]

;W[mp];B[pq];W[rj]C[hmph: this move was painful to me.

Yes. Now, please have a look at move #44 and compare the postions. Nearly hundred moves back you dominated the whole right side, and w had a weak group on the upper left. Not a group that could be killed directly. But it was weak and a reason for concerns.

Now w's group is definitly alive, and you have a bit, but not very much territory on the right. The reason is that you tried to kill a group which could not be killed. When your opponent has a weak group you have to be very patient and watch it closely from the distance. Then, here and there, you can make a move that threatens this group. You have to choose these moves carefully, so that they help you to build something you really want. Just a clash, when it is very unclear what you gain, does not help.]
;B[ri]LB[rl:A]C[Aji-keshi and much too direct. You have to play more from a distance, maybe 'A'. if you wisely give up something, you can therefore have something else for sure, here the lower right side/corner. This holds also for the following moves.]

MA[rn][rl][sk][rj][sj][si]C[hmph: I gave up many points here. I'm unsure of the way of blocking a jump into my territory. how should i have played here?

Your actual move is the right shape. You should have played such a move much earlier.]
;W[kp];B[rm];W[sm];B[fm];W[em];B[en]LB[jq:A][nr:B]C[Gote and small. 'A' should be sente, and 'B' is big.]
;W[dm];B[fn];W[gp];B[hp];W[gr];B[hr]LB[hq:A][fr:B]C[Better 'A' so that 'B' isn't atari.]
;W[fr];B[kr];W[lr];B[kq];W[lq];B[jp];W[hq]C[hmph: were the 2 stones(captured ones) big or small?

Gote, but big, considering the follow-up at j2.];B[iq];W[gq]

(;W[nr]LB[ps:A][qs:B][os:C][rr:D]C[hmph: I thought the white A black B white C black D sequence was the right way, or am i missing something here?
This is my last question. I've been told that my endgame is rather weak, please notify me of any mistakes that i make. Thanks.

The w move is correct. W can play the sequence from 'A' to 'D' still in sente. Please refer also to the variations.]

[rs][ss]C[This was a very interesting game to comment on, as it shows a main weakness of your game quite prototypical:

You attack to hard and with no focus. It seems that you don't know what you want to achive with an attack (except maybe from killing), but you fight it anyway. In contrast you should try to develop your game on a large scale. Not so much local fighting, but occupying big points. Develop frameworks, moyos.

In the end you won this game, but the main reason for this lies in your strong opening. You were definitly ahead after move #44. W did not handle the fight very well, so that you could build some territory on the right. Nevertheless: Fighting too hard and without vision seems to be your weakest point. In your future games you should lean back from time to time (maybe when you want to start an attac) and have a look at the whole board. Ask yourself first, if there is a big move appart from that attack. If not, holding a group of your opponent weak is fine. But develop a plan what you want to achieve with this attack. Ask yourself: Where do I want to build up influence or make definite territory?]
