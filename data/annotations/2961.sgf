C[Thanks for allowing me to comment this game for you.

Hope it helps.];B[qd]C[--------- Your midgame isn't strong enough compared to your fuseki, and you are playing way too passive, that's why you lost.
 Midgame is about reading. So I suggest you play more aggressively, and force yourself to read a lot.]
;W[dd]C[-------------Fuseki is about carrying out your own plans, and destroying the opponent's plans.]

(;B[pq];W[do]C[---- Double kimoku is a slow but firm, and more territory-preferred fuseki.

" I'll take the bottom side! " Claims black. 

After B[q5\] or [r5\], bottom side will be very big for black.

---- However, white plays at d5, which says: " Take what you want, i'll let you pay otherwhere else." ( although as the player of white, you didn't really intend to do so :P )

White's stones are on the 4th line, which is good for forming moyo or engage in fightings.]

(;B[oc]C[
 czark 4k*: good afternoon
 haniwa 4k*: Hi - goood evening i'm in the uk
-------------------------------

---------Good move. if B[r5\], then b's fuseki looks flat and flavourless.

----------According to Ishida's book, this enclosure worths at least 20 pts. (plus influence)]

(;W[qi]C[--------W[r11\] is wrong. There are several reasons.

1, If you allow the opponent to have two enclosurs like in this game, you will probably lose. So said in old fuseki theories.

2, New fuseki theories don't approve ( yet don't oppose ) the words above, however, corners are always bigger than sides.

3, As you've known already, after b[q5\], white will have problems playing at  bottom side.

Better play [q6\] here, it's probably the only choice for white.
See in variation.]N[**];B[qo]LB[qf:f][qk:e][jo:g][jp:b][dq:a]
[hq:c][jq:d]C[7 makes the bottom a big area for black to play in but I couldn't find a good play there that I thought went well with 4. 
---------- I can't find a good way, either. :-\
White A, black B is clearly good for black

---------- yepp.
 but w[a\], b[d\], w[c\], b[e\], w[f\], b[g\] --  Even better for black.

- can white play at B to build influence when black enters around A?
---------- Yes, you can.
 But 'a' and 'b' are just miai, it's no better than w[a\], b[d\].

----------How come white has so many problems here?
 It's because of w[r11\]

----------b[r7\] gains another 20 pt corner, but what about w[r11\]? After b[e\], w[f\], w has only 4 pts on the right side.]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[mc]LB[qk:c]C[I still couldn't find a decent way of playing around the bottom, so I ignored it and played 10 here. when black 11 induces white 12, it feels like an ok way to begin to reduce the bottom. If black extends up to C however, I would start to worry.]

(;B[qg];W[ql];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er];W[ck]C[14-18 feels like an ok way to play. Black expands his moyo, but mine is big as well, albeit quite loose.

---------- W[c9\] is a joseki move, but i'll suggest you play c10, it prevents b's kakari at c14

---------- Now B is already ahead a little, because of w[6\].]

(;B[cc]LB[cf:d]C[Not very surprising I suppose, but I wonder if black could have held back a little longer as white's moyo is still fairly loose. Alternatively how about coming in at D instead?

-------- yes, b[d\] is better];W[cd];B[bc]C[I'm not used to this move - i thought that the variation we played was good for white in comparison with the usual.

-------- yes, but w can get even better results here, see in variation. 
 b[b17\] is a very bad move. after this b is no longer ahead.]
N[**]
(;W[bd]C[--------Too loose];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc]

(;B[fp]C[----------b must play g18, otherwise w[g18\] is big sente.]

(;W[fn]LB[ej:e][fj:g][ek:f]C[This is at the boundry of the 2 moyos but white's feels quite loose. Can white play at E or F say instead?

--------- you are right, too loose.
 but 'g' is better than 'e' and 'f'
 AND play g18 before all these.
 It's a double sente.
 It's urgent.];B[fg]C[here b invaded in. Better make an score estimate before your next move.

Black:
 TR corner: 15
 Bottom side: 30 (there's m3 and q2 invation, so it's not firm territory, but once b gets the chance to extend at q7, B's territory will grow up to 40 and above)
 TL corner: 6 (supposing that w has played g18 (and it's now w's turn, isnt it? ))
 51 totally (or more)

White:
 Right side: 4 (yes, no more)
 Top side: 12
 Left side: 30
 Komi: 6.5
 52.5 totally (more or less)

------ B has lost its advantage.]
(;W[dg];B[ek];W[di]C[black's 31 and 33 felt quite natural and good ways of limiting my moyo but I still have a good opportunity to attack them I feel

----- Yes, but black's two stones are very light, they have finished their task, which means b can sacrifice them when needed.
----- Go Seigen says: " if one move makes the opponent to respond, then this move(stone) becomes 'light' ".]
;B[gn]LB[fm:g]C[I didn't really want to answer this at G because I thought that black's moyo would be too solid if black got any more moves in.

--------- yes, yes, also because u didnt realise b[e6\] would thrash you so badly  -.-"

 B[g6\] is a good move, you shouldnt play tenuki.]
(;W[pr]C[I think that this is too deep in retrospect. If black allows white to form the tripod group in the corner but takes the outside I think that is very big.

------- right again. please see in variations.]
(;B[or];W[oq];B[qr]C[So this helps white i think

--------- yesh];W[pp];B[qq];W[nr];B[ps];W[kq]C[Being forced outside has helped white I think, but I've no real experience of playing lightly so this was just a guess really

----------w[l3\] would be aji-keshi in most situations
 I'd prefer w[l4\] here, not sure if it's better...];B[nq];W[mq]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[ln]C[u dont need to jump out here. just settle at j2 would be ok.]
;B[jq]C[now you have to take care about yuor n4 group...];W[rn]
C[The 2 white stones were feeling a bit endangered, so I played this to stabilize them

---------- yes, this needs stablizing, and n4 group also needs stablizing, and w has weakness at e6, and w didnt realise the g18 sente...

 You will be buzy...];B[lr];W[nn];B[mo];W[lo];B[mr];W[mn];B[pn]
;W[oo];B[ns];W[on]C[This doesn't seem to be very light play, but the stones are on the outside, and not far from connection to another group.

------ actually u've already connected if you have played w[q7\]]
;B[pm]
(;W[qp]C[what's w[r4\] for?
 it's just pure aji-keshi.];B[ro];W[nk]C[--------Too loose]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[kp]C[I now read the game as follows:

I count the two moyos as about even ~30 points each. Thus to win I'm going to have to genterate some terratory toward the centre and reduce the upper right further.

--------Yes, you are right.

--------b[l4\] tenuki is obviously too small, btw, how dare b play tenuki here? -- see in variation.]

(;W[ol];B[rp];W[rd]LB[oe:h]C[This also looks to deep now. How about a move at H to reduce the corner and strengthen the white centre?

--------  w[s16\] is ok, b could hardly fight back here, see in variation --
--------- w[h\] is to decrease b's shimari with two wings (spreads at both sides), if there are only one wing, this move isnt good.]

(;B[re];W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[rb]C[--------to connect at q17 is safer.]

(;B[sd];W[pc]C[Once again black seems to have helped me out. The corner is gone and I now have potential for some real terratory along the top.
Assuming the 2 moyos are still about the same, black maybe slightly bigger, the komi is roughly the same as the top left and so white looks quite good here.

---------- W has gain much profit at top right. Now b has only about 50 mo, while w has about 60 mo.]
;B[en]
(;W[eo];B[fo]C[This is big - the way i handle it is bad, but I how should i play - at I looks like it gives up a lot of ground to black.

--------yes there's a way, but at earlier. see in variation.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[gm];B[cl]
(;W[bk]C[-------------w[88\] is very bad
 Can I call this "shape-addicted"?]N[**];B[cn]C[Disaster

---------- D00M];W[br];B[bs];W[bo];B[bn];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[bm]
C[Up to 97 I should have left out, but I was try to see if there was any weakness to the 81,85,87 stones.
I count the bottom as 55+ points for black, versus 18 on the left for white - a lot of ground to make up.
I manage to start a decent fight in the centre, but I'm always struggling from here
czark 4k*: a beautiful day in Oregon for a change :)
