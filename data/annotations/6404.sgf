C[Felix37 [11k\]: hi





Hi reviewer, thanks very much for taking the time...



I was playing white in this game on KGS, and I've added my comments in brackets so you can know where I'm coming from a bit better.  I want to improve of course, so would appreciate any feedback you have, especially about strategy and using sente to best effect.  Looking forward to listening to what you have to say.



Thanks,

Felix

After looking at the game, my general comments would be to beware of small moves, and look for large ones.  Don't automatically play next to where you opponent just played.  Especially keep an eye on the edges of the board where boundaries are yet undetermined, there are often plays there that are big relative to a local tightening of boundaries.

Also, practice counting territory.  You fell behind very early on (assuming you didn't kill the F15 group).  It is useful to know this, so you can estimate how passively/aggressively you should play.  I suspect you were expecting to get more from the center than you did.  Learn to mistrust center territory.  It almost always ends up smaller than you hope for.]

Just some general thoughts.  You have a nice wall, and a nice moyo around C7.  However, you have almost no territroy, and you still have to worry some about keeping the marked groups alive. B has two large areas of solid territory, and a group in the upper left that should have no problems, given that he has your weak two stones to attack.

So:
1. Use your moyo - extend it and/or solidify it into solid territory.
2. Use your wall - its basic purpose is to drive a weak B group into it. Which means you need to create a weak B group.  Your options there are to split off the F3,H4 stones, or make your moyo so scary he has to invade.
3. Secure you weak stones.

Given the above, I would tend to consider moves like the lettered points.
(Though I don't think I could make D would actually work, I would consider it in the search for ways to create a weak B group.)]

This is not a wall you should be happy about.  What does it do for you?

Look at the discussion at move 40.  What has changed?  You've traded your moyo for a very small amount of real territory, and solidified B around H4.
In other words, you are now significantly worse off than you were 20 moves ago.]

You force a weak group into thickness for advantage in fighting.  This is a snake off of a strong group.  You are just driving it through your best shot at territory.]

O16 works to reduce in that area.  As far as being ahead, um...only if the entire center becomes your territory. (Assuming you are counting the F15 group as alive.)]

(I was surprised to see he wins by 20.5 points, as most of the stuff I tried worked quite well, so I think my strategy for influence-play needs to be heavily modified... Thanks again, reviewer)

The game is won with territory.  The idea of influence is to delay taking territory now (in the early game) for advantage in fighting (or threat of fighting) that must eventually be converted into territory later.  You built a beautiful wall, facing a potentially large moyo.  But in exchange you gave B a lot of solid territory.  You then helped B wipe out the moyo, so that the wall had nothing to do.  Use a wall for fighting weak groups.  Look for ways to make weak groups, and make sure you use attacks against a weak group to your advantage...to eventually increase your territory.  Don't let a weak group (like at F15) just sit there unmolested.]
