AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[[jorge\] Hello, I have added comments and variations on some moves, here I am giving a general game overview:
- White, with 6 handi, should be more oriented to big moves. He is attacking nice spots but in several cases he is playing small points in surrounded live groups (e.g. H1, A17). You may need to read more to avoid simple mistakes (e.g. L2, J17). And don't help your opponent split your groups as with J5.
- Black has some mistakes because of his category, that´s ok, but when having sente he should try to avoid: (1) playing at random places (e.g. O13), (2) killing dead stones if not needed to (e.g. G9) and (3) playing inside his territory unless strictly necessary (e.g. F11), specially in yose. Sente is too valuable to just discard it.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[jq]C[[jorge\] Passive but ok with so much handicap.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ch]C[[jorge\] Consider C15 here as standard.];W[bd];B[cc]
;W[ec];B[ee]C[[jorge\] I'd prefer E16, if white defends black can then close white's way out with D14 or cut his base with B17.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[fc];B[eg]C[[jorge\] good, limit space and avoid escape]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[bh]
(;B[bi]C[[jorge\] B13 better, see var.1];W[bg];B[cg];W[df];B[ef]
;W[ge];B[ng]C[[jorge\] too far, on this side I would play O16. If not sure, O15 at least.]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[kf];B[mf];W[me]C[[jorge\] I feel this move too passive for white with handy, O14 may be dangerous but it looks more active.]
;B[lf];W[le];B[kg];W[jo]C[[jorge\] Good change of focus, white needs to play over all the board. I don't know if the point is the best, probably yes because of the big center, and he can still attack the corner stones.]
;B[mp];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq];B[mr];W[lo];B[lp]C[[jorge\] I would leave this play for later and take a big point, black cannot cut here, and after white plays L4 the two stones M4-N4 are short of liberties so the hole at N3 opens..]
;W[kp];B[gq]C[[jorge\] white leaves too many holes on the lower side, if he wanted to take out white's base he should connect at M2.]
;W[hp]C[[jorge\] I think this move (and next) helps black to get thicker and does not get too much for white, I would play N3 right now, to make a hole into black position and to make the L4 group safe as soon as possible.]
;B[hq];W[hn];B[fo]C[[jorge\] I dont like this one  too much but I am not sure what to play. Maybe protect and expand the right corner with N5, or the left with D3.]
;W[km]C[[jorge\] again, I would play N3. Does not look big, but black M4-N4 are weak.]
;B[ig];W[jf];B[jg];W[mq];B[nq];W[mo]C[[jorge\] Ok to play on the right side. I considered some sequences starting with O4, it looks good, but I cannot bet which is best.]
;B[np];W[qn]C[[jorge\] good timing];B[ql];W[on];B[no];W[nn]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[lm]C[[jorge\] why not K6?]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[in];W[io]C[[jorge\] Wrong move, white should play J7 to avoid being cut by black. White may want to get influence on both sides and keep sente, but the price is too high. Losing move?]
;B[im];W[il];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[fn]C[[jorge\] The cut at G5 is huge.]
;B[go]C[[jorge\] Perfect. White was split in three weak groups.]
;W[dm];B[bl];W[eo];B[ep];W[do];B[co];W[cn]
(;B[gn]C[[jorge\] Not needed. If white connects here, black still has H5. Locally it´s better to protect the cut at C4. See variation.]
;W[em];B[fl];W[bo];B[cp];W[bm];B[fm];W[en];B[el]C[[jorge\] white is alive, so I would play elsewhere, e.g. cut at O7.]

(;W[kr]C[[jorge\] ...white also makes a mistake, he should play J1 (see variation)]
;B[ho];W[hr];B[gs]C[[jorge\] no effect move, white can tenuki]
;W[is];B[gr];W[hs]C[[jorge\]since white is alive (K3-K1), playing here is too small and gote, white needs a bigger move, e.g G13 or near N10, B2, etc.]

(;B[ce]C[[jorge\] I do not understand this move. I did not analyze fuly - it's a life and death problem - but it looks like A14 was the vital point (see variation).]
(;W[be]C[[jorge\] this is a mistake, now black can kill white. White have played D15 (see variations)]
(;B[aa]C[[jorge\] another mistake, black can kill. See variation.]
