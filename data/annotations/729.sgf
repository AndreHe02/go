;B[cc];W[dp];B[qq];W[pd];B[pj];W[jp];B[pn]C[NOT OPTIMAL
Create a somewhat slack shape on the right side (the 3 Black stones are not optimately placed).

Shoud be exchanging Black R14 for White O17 then Black N4 create an optimal Black structure.]
;W[nc]C[NOT OPTIMAL

Better at R12 or D10 or D14.];B[jd]C[WRONG DIRECTION

Too close to a White strong group.
The upper side is not important because Black and White stones on the upper side are on the third line.
Shoud be approach at R14 or C6.];W[de];B[dd]C[STRANGE

The usual move is keima at E16];W[ee];B[ed];W[fe];B[gd]C[LEAVES WEAKNESSES

This move leaves Black with weaknesses better to play keima at G17.]
;W[dj];B[hg]C[SLACK SHAPE

Leaves Black with weaknesses];W[fd]C[NOT NECESSARY

To exploit the weakness of Black shape White should simply play at H14.]
;B[fc];W[ge];B[hd];W[if];B[ij]C[OK

Looks like a good move.];W[ce]C[OK];B[cd]C[STUPID

Not necessary, lose initiative, makes bad shape with C17.
Black has lost one move.

Black should approach at C6 or F3 or invade san-san at C3.]
;W[cq]C[NOT OPTIMAL

Too much concerned with the corner points
Probably better at D6.];B[eh];W[ch]C[NOT NECESSARY

Helps White
Black lose the aji of invading the side latter.];B[fk]C[NOT NECESSARY

Helps White.
Black lose the aji of invading the side latter.

Question: (Vivek)
27 and 29 were called aji keshi.
Does this mean I should wait for later before making an even deeper invasion (like maybe D12 or C12,etc).
In that case what would the pre-requirements for such an invasion be? A strong center?
Answer:
Yes, you should keep the opportunity to invade deeply at C12,D12,B13, C8 or C10 for latter.
Before invading, be strong in the center would be better, but if you were short of points, invading anyway would be ok.]
;W[dl];B[lp];W[np]C[JEALOUS

This Black area is very small, White should better play G4 or jump at K6.]
;B[nn]C[NOT GOOD

Better to jump at M6.];W[mo]C[DIFFICULT FOR BLACK

Now there is nothing very good for Black.];B[lo];W[mn];B[ln]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[nl]C[STRANGE

Makes miai of M8 and Q8 but the common move here is tobi (jump) at N9 or nobi (extension) at N8.]
;B[pl]C[BETTER AT M8

Question: (Vivek)
You have called move 41 a mistake.But what do I do about white's threatened Q8?How would M8 help?Can you give me some possible sequences after M8.
Answer:
Very good question. I said better at M8, but...
M8 is the shape move for Black.
b M8, w Q8, b O10...
Usually, this way of playing for Black is good. In deed, it would be very good if Black was sure to play first G4.
But, in this game, because the Black corner (R3,Q6) is weak,
probably  White can live with Sente and play G4 first.
So, this is not so good for Black. Your move (b Q8) could even be the right one. Perhaps both  Q8 and M8 are playable.]
;W[mj]C[SLACK SHAPE   Should be hane at M8.];B[mh]C[MISS THE VITAL POINT

Should be M8.];W[nh]C[MISS THE VITAL POINT

Should be M8.];B[mg]C[MISS THE VITAL POINT

There is nothing to build for Black in this direction.
Should be the vital point (M8) then after White answer Black should play  G4. This take the initiative on the lower side.]
;W[ni];B[kk]C[NOT THE VITAL POINT

Playing M8 instead threatens to cut.];W[ll];B[kl];W[ph];B[kf]
C[STUPID

Not necessary, lose initiative, do not make points.
It is the second time in the game that Black loses a move.
The first time was Black C16.

Black should better invade at G4.];W[ie];B[id];W[qi]C[NOT NECESSARY]
;B[qj];W[ri]C[TOO EARLY

Not necessary.
Looks like yose (endgame) point.];B[gp]C[OK

Good move];W[gq]C[GOOD];B[hq]C[BETTER AT F3

Question: (Vivek)
Why did you say 59 was better at F3?
Answer:
The idea is that if you play F3, you claim for more territory.
In the game, even if White simply draw back at F3, you are not satisfied.
If you block outside at F3 the sequence could be:
wG3 bF3 wF4 bE4 wF5 bE3 wE5 bH3 wG2 bH2 wG5 bH4 wE7.];W[fq]
C[PERHAPS BETTER TO CUT

Cutting at H4 first would create some aji.
We imagine, wH4 bJ3 wF3 bG5.
  But simply drawing back at E3 as in the game is OK for White.]
;B[iq]C[ABSURD

The only move in this shape is connecting];W[go]C[GOOD

Punishes Black for not connecting];B[fo]C[ABUSIVE

Does not work in this game position.];W[fp];B[fn]C[AJI KESHI

Not necessary, helps White by removing other Black possibilities such as E7 or D7.
There is nothing very good here for Black for the moment, so Black should play elsewhere and come back latter.
He could first play a forcing move at P13 then invade at R16.
After this he could choose between the risky move of D7 or the conservative at E7.]
;W[hp];B[jq];W[dn]C[SOLID

Locally this has been a catastroph for Black.
Black has nearly completely lost the game.];B[lc]C[LOSING MOVE

Black is not ahead in this game so he has to fight by invading at R16.

Question: (Vivek)
How does B continue after the suggested R16? Can he live there?
Can you tell me some possible sequences?
Answer:  Here are two possible sequences.
1°) White block outside and Black live in the corner:
bR16, wR15, bQ17, wP16, bS17, wS15, bP18, wO18, bR18.
2°) White Block the corner and Black connect with the outside:
bR16, wR17, bR15, wS17, bQ15, wP16, bP14.

Sequence 1 looks better for White than sequence 2.
There is a lot of possible variations.];W[mb];B[ng];W[og]C[AJI KESHI

Just helps White to solidify his territory.

Black has lost the game by more than 20 points.];B[mp]C[NOT GOOD

There is nothing for Black to do here];W[no];B[nq];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[sl]C[TOO EARLY

Bigger at M18.];B[rj]C[DOESN'T STOP THE MONKEY JUMP

The good move here to stop the monkey jump is T7 (not S8).]

Robertm comments were: Opening strange but consistent and kept stones light-which means Black could give up and still gain something;
learn monkey jump-On right side Black should play S8,White T9 then Black T10 could save 5 points on lower side and 7 on upper.
I should have continued attack White running group
and built right side-easy win then-All this according to robertm.

DENIS HANOTIN (Reviewer) COMMENT:
Yes, you should learn how to stop the monkey jump, there are several ways depending on the position.This is a difficult problem.
Robertm should learn too, because the move he propose S8 doesn't work in this position because Black answer it at T7.
According to me, you lose 8 points on the upper side and only 2 on the right. But in any case, it's very big.
I don't think you could win the game by attacking the White group.

Robertm seem to be a much stronger opponent than you, he played a good game.

You made two stupid moves (C16 and M14) any of this moves is a stone lost. It loses initiative for nothing.

You tend to play a lot of aji keshi moves. This unnecessary  moves don't lose initiative but they are very bad indeed. They help your opponent by making him stronger and lose you opportunities for the rest of the game. you should concentrate on banishing this kind of move. When a move is not necessary it should not be played.]
