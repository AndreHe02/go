C[Hello Burke,

I'm Hans and I reviewed this game. I have included many variations and I hope that they don't overwhelm you. If they do, skip most of them and just concentrate on the points of the following summary:

My main comments: 
- the cut at G4 was much better than the invasion at G3 (move 13), in principle and in practice.
- the life and death in the upper left corner was quite complicated, and after white played D8 he was totally alive. Before that there was a ko
- the lower right corner was standing around in undecided status for a long time. In the very end white could've attacked the 7-space-eyeshape with G1 to get a thousand-year-ko (which could result in a seki), but white attacked at H2 instead. That gave you the chance to defend and be unconditionally alive with G1 yourself. When you missed that, he played G1 and this time it really killed.
- the big white group was not alive until white finally got around to playing J7. That was a catastophe waiting to happen.

My main recommendation with regard to the life-&-death in this game is to start reading the book "Life and Death" by James Davies. Sometimes it can be dry reading, but it is very helpful, even if you only know the first chapters.

When you posed a question, I put 'B:' in front of it, and 'H:' in front of my answer to distinguish. 

I certainly tried to do my best, but please bear in mind that I am only a 6 kyu these days and also that I am no 9x9 specialist. However, regarding the life&death I hope to offer some help. Have fun with the review and in case you reach 5-dan before me, please tell me where I went wrong...

Greetings,

Hans];B[ee];W[ff];B[fe];W[ge]
(;B[cg]C[Probably not really bad, but why tenuki?];W[ef];B[df]

(;W[fd]C[maybe too aggressive];B[ed];W[fc];B[ec]C[So far, it all looks natural to me.]
;W[cc]C[This seems a little risky, especially as white still has the cuttting points on G4 and G6.]

(;B[gg]C[B: maybe it was a mistake to try to live here in the first place?
#

H: With this move, it looks not so likely that black can live. The stone could become a sacrifice stone, though. 
But it is okay to try something now - either kill the upper left or live here in the lower right - as you would lose if white got the upper left and the complete right side. 
-->__However__, there is a Go-proverb which says "Don't peep where you can cut". As all the proverbs, it doesn't always apply, but I think it does here, see variation. (In practice I don't at all think the game was over for you now or anything like that against an opponent of about equal strength. Only a pity that you forced your opponent to connect, which he probably wanted to do anyway [a so called thank-you move\].)]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dh];B[fh];W[dg]C[Feels annoying with your lower right not safe yet and the cutting points C4 and D5 to worry about. White is back in the game]

(;B[hg]C[B: I wasn't sure what to do here, this was just a guess

H: I think this was a good try to keep sente];W[hf];B[ce]C[Great, you cover both cutting points! Now, if the lower right lives (it shouldn't), and the upper left doesn't, you win. But as the lower right is not alive yet, you had better played H1 to make it alive.]

(;W[cd]C[Surprising, to say the least.]
(;B[dc]C[This looks a little unusual, shapewise. But shape were not important, if it got the job done. Here, however, this move leaves white the freedom to expand his eyespace later at D8, which he did. In other words: it didn't restrict white, it was only _hoping_ to restrict him _later_ with C8 or maybe a behind-the-lines-tesuji at B8.]

(;W[be]C[Turns out to be possible, but, it looks better to expand the other way at D8.]
;B[bf]
(;W[ae]C[In a way this was a wasted move, black doesn't have to react to that, a white move at A4 is not a threat.]

(;B[af];W[bc];B[ad]C[B: this didn't turn out to be the way to kill the w group on the left but I wonder if there wasn't a way I could have

H: I think an important concept in life and death is to try _first_ to narrow the opponent's eyespace and kill (by putting a stone inside the opponent's remaining eyespace) only at the last moment. This here move doesn't do that and is too early (though, of course, white has to react by connecting and black gets another chance). From what I see, black can get a ko to kill, but in the final analysis he cannot win the ko at this point in the game.]
;W[bd]
(;B[ac]C[B: i was just guessing on how to kill this group

H: This speculates on that your opponent takes the two stones and that you then get the chance to narrow the eyespace by playing C8. But even then, he can live with ko, and also if the opponent sees the trap, he can use his turn to widen his eyespace with D8 and the opportunity is lost. You could've played C8 now and then there ist still a (theoretical) kill with a ko.]

(;W[db]C[the correct reaction, now white should live even without a ko]

(;B[ba]C[B: another guess

;B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[ia];B[ga]
(;W[hh]C[B: is there a way i could have lived here?

H: Yes! G1 would be the move for that. It was also, by the way, the best move for white to attack this 7-space eyeshape. The result then would've been a so-called thousand-year-ko or seki.]

(;B[gi]C[This move is on the vital point and makes you instantly alive - one eye at F1 and the other in the other five points (just be careful not to let white have H1 AND J2, because then it is a seki again as both players have one eye and neither player can approach.

As stated before: G1 would also have been a stronger attack, if white had played here, resulting in a seki or in a ko, but in this case in a seki as black doesn't have any ko-threats, see the lines below (this shape is also in Davies' "Life and Death", though with two outside liberties, problem 5 on page123, chapter "Seki in the corner")]

Before, either player could start the ko, but at a disadvantage (the opponent takes first and one has to make an approach move, too; it is called a "thousand-year-ko" because it is often left unplayed quasi forever and in the end white makes the seki. You can look it and this kind of stuff up in "Life and Death" by James Davies)]

(;B[gh]C[if black approaches like this white can];W[ii]C[kill with this (the famous "bent four in the corner", which are not a seki, but are dead, the reasoning being as follows: in theory white could, at the very end of the game remove all remaining ko-threats are and then play J2 to give atari. Then, after being captured at F1, he could play right back in at H1, threatening J1 which kills. So, to keep white from playing on J1, black would have to play on J1 himself which starts a ko, but when white takes on J2 black is in atari and has no ko-threats.)]

(;B[tt]C[black can either do nothing here, in which case]
(;W[ii]C[white will eventually make a seki here (note: this is not reducible to the bent four in the corner due to the empty point of G2; either black or white will fill J2 at the very end of the game as a dame point  or white can play G2 as a dame point in the end [but black should of course abstain from playing G2, which would again make the bent four in the corner\])]

(;B[ii]C[or black can start a thousand-year ko, which in this case would be hopeless as he has not a single ko-threat (white, however has two ko-threats left: D6, threatening D5, and B3, threatening to capture at C4 for another ko [and black still doesn't have ko-threats...\]]
)))
