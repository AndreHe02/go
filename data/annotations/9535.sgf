C[STARHILL [6k\]: hi
Ethelor [6k\]: Hi, gg

Hagios: Hello!  This was a tough game for white.  Most of my focus in this review is in the early game, where you had the most trouble.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[pd];W[cp]C[S.

Hello,

I lose this game by 50 ponts

I am white

Thanks for the review in advance];B[eq]LB[dn:A][do:B]C[H: A or B lead to simpler games.]

(;W[gq]C[H: Before you pincer, ask: "what does this pincer accomplish?"]
;B[cr];W[dq];B[dr];W[ep];B[cq];W[dp];B[fr];W[fq];B[er]C[S.

I thought this joseki went quite well for me

Black is on the first line and that's not good at all

The only problem is that there is no extension for my wall and there is a cut at F4

H: The cut isn't a big problem.  I definitely prefer white at this point.]

(;W[pf]C[S.

I try to fix with this ladder breaker];B[nc];W[dj]C[S.

Then get the extension];B[dl]LB[ek:A][fk:B]C[S.

I didnt want to kill this stone outright becuase he probably is able to live

I just want to push him toward my wall

The two main moves I had in mine were A and B

I am not sure when I should use each one

In the end I chose B

H: In this position, black can't expect much.  It's also very difficult to surround a stone in such a position, so it's better not to attack directly.]

(;W[fk];B[fm];W[gl];B[fo];W[fp];B[hn]LB[dj:A][dp:B]C[S.

In the end black jumps out when I meant to surround him

H: You have two weak groups now]
(;W[el]LB[cp:A]C[H: This cut was ill-timed.  It weakens the A group.]
;B[em];W[dm];B[fl];W[ek];B[dn];W[cm];B[cn];W[cl];B[hp]C[S.

I realized too late that my stones were about to die]
(;W[eo]LB[en:A]C[H: This is a mistake, helping black to fix the weakness at A.]

I didn't realize that this doesn't make an eye];B[ar];W[gr]
;B[ir];W[hq];B[aq];W[fn];B[gm];W[bm]C[S.

I play this last move to make sure im not undercut, I thought there was a Ko but there was no ko. After black connects I decide to abandon ship

At this point I probably should have resigned but I didnt want to give up so easily]
;B[an]C[H: Winning is very difficult at this point.];W[fc];B[cf]

Push toward thickness?];W[db];B[cc];W[ic]C[S.

This is pretty hopeless, I have no use for this wall

H: Yes, the game was over when A was lost.];W[no];B[pk];W[pj]
