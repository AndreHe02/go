;B[pq]C[ yerbamate says: Hi

DRS: "yerbamate" aka "DRS", is the player with the  black stones, and is the requester of this review.

DRS: This game went badly, despite early good  fortune in the UL, and I don't really know what I did  wrong.  I've added a couple of questions and  comments in the game, but I'd love to hear about  anything you see that looks like it could be improved  upon, or even your personal preferences.

Hello!

The review ends at move 101 as the rest of the game  is uninteresting. Be sure to check my remarks at that  point. The main feature of this game are white probe  moves on black shimari's - after this black lost the will  to fight and did not attack as strongly as the situation  warranted.

Hope you find this review interesting!

As always - Let me know if you have any questions or  problems.

(;B[cf]C[I'd rather see this as a shimari or the variation...]

(;W[ch]C[See var...];B[cc]C[Good!];W[cd]C[DRS: This was a mistake on White's part?  Or is it?  I  know you're supposed to block on the wider side, but  what's really the wider side in this case?

The left side is wider.];B[dc];W[ec]C[DRS: Overplay?

In short, yes. However, it is an interesting move. If  white plays the usual joseki he ends in gote. White  wanted to end in sente to get the first play on the right  side.]
;B[bc]LB[bc:15][eb:a]C[Could have also been at a. The result is slightly worse  but black would get sente.]
;W[bd];B[ed];W[fc];B[de];W[bf]LB[bf:20]TR[jc]C[The marked stone makes a lot of difference in this  sequence...

This move is somewhat novel - but it only works if  there are white stones in the surroundings.]
;B[be];W[fd];B[ee];W[bg];B[ad]C[DRS: White got two good forcing moves out of this  small loss.  I can't help but feel maybe it wasn't as big  a benefit to Black as I'd originally believed.

Locally this is terrible for white. There are however  three redeeming features in this position:
1. White already has an extension on top
2. White has a developed position on the right
3. White can take sente

Please compare this result to the variation I proposed  on move 10. After the variation ends white has a  choice of whether to take the corner or to enclose black  in the corner. In the game black got the corner and the  access to the center. Black got the upper hand in this  exchange.]
;W[qj]LB[qj:26][cj:A]C[White took sente but there is a weakness white must  bear in mind at A. Black can at any time play there and  separate white. In addition white large knight  extension in lower-left can be invaded so white  position on the left is weak.]

(;B[qf]C[Perhaps a shimari in the other corner is in order. Also  see variation...]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[pr]C[DRS: White invaded with basically this same  sequence twice in this game.  Did I mishandle it  somehow?  Given that White did it again, it must have  seemed to go well to White the first time.

This is a standard probe...]
(;B[or]C[I would say this is a mistake. Since black is aiming at  making territory on the lower side - letting white create  aji in the corner is good enough. See var...]
;W[oq]
(;B[qr]C[There are variations black should think about before  playing 33. See var...]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[nr];B[ps]C[DRS: White gets so many forcing moves...]

(;W[np]C[A lighter approach is called for. See var.];B[mq];W[nq]

(;B[mr]C[See var...];W[ns]LB[ns:42][po:a]C[Connecting with a is more usual...]

(;B[ms]C[This is a really bad move. 43 achieves next to nothing  while it makes the 3  black stones heavy and a perfect target for white to  lean on to secure his group. It is a move that really  stands out - a mistake not in accord with your strength.   I really cannot criticize it enough so if you learn  anything from this review it should be to never play  moves like this...
See var..]
(;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp]LB[kp:47][kq:a]C[Still there is a weakness at a...]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qn]C[Considering black position was quite strong on the  bottom side, white did good here.]
;B[lc]C[DRS: Too far?

This is a bit thin, and white doesn't have much to fear  from the attack at his top-side group.]
;W[pb]C[DRS: Here it is again.

It shows good timing. White want's to test your  response to see whether he should reduce or invade  the extension..]

(;B[ob]C[See var...];W[oc];B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[nb]C[DRS: And again, White gets two forcing moves that  seem quite useful.

Yes - this is the main disadvantage of the shimari.]

See var...

You do not need to answer submissively with friendly  forces around.]

(;B[eh]C[See var...];W[ge]C[Again white is taking care of his defects...]
;B[ej]LB[ej:77][cj:a]C[This needed to be at a.
1. When behind use the chance to make the game  confusing (higher number of weak groups and a  complex position).
2. When your strong group is next to a weak group you  must attack the weak group and drive here against  your strong group.

In short - even without the 75 on the board a move  around a would be a strong move. With 75 there it is  the only move]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[el];W[dk];B[ek];W[gf]C[This puts the lead firmly into white hands.]
;B[eg];W[pf]LB[pf:86][mc:a]C[The last two moves show white was aware of the  dangers of black a. Black may still try and play there  but both white groups are quite secure now and the  game is already won.]
;B[qg];W[mn];B[jg]LB[jg:89]TR[lc]C[Considering black strength and the marked stone this  reduction is too shallow.]
;W[je];B[mg]C[This forces white to eat the black stone which he is  happy to do...]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[ri]
(;B[hh]C[See var...];W[le];B[hl];W[im];B[il];W[oh]
(;B[mj]C[DRS: I now think this was a mistake, but I really don't  know what to do instead.

See var.
After the sequence in the center white plays slow and  safe moves and although black gains some points in  the endgame the result is decided.

Your biggest mistakes (43, 59, 67 etc... ) are the result  of thinking  of secure territory only. Try to look at the board as a  collection of groups of stones. Some are strong - some  are weak. Attack his weak groups, defend your weak  groups. Don't extend from your strong groups but use  them as cornerstones of your mojo. Play some games  without counting the territory you have and think in  group terms only. Do not decide where your territory is  in advance and do not be inflexible about it. Do not  answer your opponents moves just because it is an  atari or he is entering your territory.

Hope you enjoyed the review!

Since white is over 20pts ahead - he responds to your  every move. Black should think about resigning here.]
