OT[5x30 byo-yomi]
RU[Japanese]

C[OD: Hello dear reviewer, this game I played as Black against white, I played the chinese opening and white got an huge moyo I failed to reduce properly, and later he also laid waste to one of my corners through peeping its shape.

I hope you can give me some insights on how to handle some of the situations that appear in this game :-)

Ps: This was a free ASR League game, with 25 minutes and 5x30 byo-yomi each, because of that it was a league game my Opponent and me already discussed it together, but I would also like to hear a third outsider opinion on the game and my mistakes.

MR: Please find my comments always starting with MR.

MR: The main two points in this game are:
a) You act too defensive ... you see where others can harm you, but you do not pay much attention to balance of power and where your opponent has weak groups.
b) You do not continue to settle your weak groups, but just leave them alone and let them be captures while switching to other goals / areas of the board.
Both points can be worked on by holding on every now and then and looking at the board from a broader perspective.]

(;B[db];W[dk]C[OD: I already was intimidating by this, and I wasn't really comfortable with omitting D18 and getting into his left side, do you have any thoughts on this? Was D18 too slow and I should have come out of my comfort zone and played C10 or C6 instead? I added an variation here were I play black C10 instead of the slide into the corner with one question added to it.

MR: Black cannot get everything ;-) I guess it is a matter of taste.]

(;W[pm]C[MR: White has no base due to black S7.];B[ok]C[OD: Would R12 be an option instead of P9?

MR: White is weak and black is strong, so R12 is not an option!]
;W[nn]C[OD: Here I felt unsure about what to do next, I saw that he could peep at Q10, but I felt like I needed to play F3, to take this move away from him

MR: F3 is fine.];B[fq];W[pj]C[OD: Instead of connecting, would R10 be an option in this constellation?

MR: Why? White is weak himself and now installs another weak group. You need not fear as long as you keep the balance of power in your favour.]

(;B[pk];W[ph]C[OD: I felt very behind now, with Q9 as a burden and my corner in danger. I didn't like the thought of jumping out with M9, because of his wall at the top.]

(;B[pb]C[OD: I felt like this would be a good move, maybe later to connect with M17 group, but I always fear the Q15 and Q17 peeps, do you have any comments on this situation? (He later played the peeps and I lost my corner, though could save my stones

MR: Too defensive. You need to separate the white groups.];W[ni]
C[MR: Now the balance of power is shifting in white's favor.]

(;B[mo]C[OD: I don't know what I wanted to achieve with this move, I felt like I need to strengthen, because of all those holes at my bottom, but maybe not the best move..

MR: Off topic. You need to separate the white groups!];W[mn]

(;B[cn]C[MR: Again off topic, you should care about the balance of power on the right!]

MR: No, it is not because of connecting at Q9 but because of leaving alone your stones after that. I indicated this already at several places.]

(;B[cg]C[OD: Do you have some suggestions how to reduce such huge moyos? Would a play at M5 or M6 been better? Before trying to invade/reduce?

MR: You have to count. Is it enough if you reduce be playing N9 and living with the right side group?
If not, you have no choice but to invade and to hope to survive ...]

(;B[jr]C[OD: Was this too submissive and I should have cut with G4? I felt like a cut would end up with white living at the bottom and destroying more territory from me than he already did with H3, and me just gaining useless influence, but maybe I am wrong?

MR: Yes, it is too submissive.];W[bc];B[mk]C[MR: You seem to be unclear yourself on which groups you want to save and which groups you want to allow to be captured. It is not a good idea to change plans about this every now and then!]

What do you think about the status of the left side black group? 
If you think that it is dead, do you feel that you can get enough territory elsewhere?
If the answer is no, why don't you do something for that group?]
