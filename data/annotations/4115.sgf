Defending the corner  - and threatening to invsde the left side is more urgent than the connection here]
;W[fp];B[kp]TR[dj][cp][dp][ep][fp][hp]C[what do you think of my move 15?  It meant that he sealed me in in that corner but my moyo on the right later on was conpensation, I thought

You should be more worried about white's moyo here.
His triangled stones work well together.
Black'rs moyo is thin by comparison and black's corner  group is still not fully secure.]

You have made the triangles stones into a target 

Better to play further up with B  if you must play round here - - see variation

however the point on the join of the two moyos at A looks better from a whole board perspective.]
;W[gc];B[ie];W[ce]C[is this a good invasion point for this set up
?]
(;B[cj]LB[cf:A][jj:B]TR[gc][ce]C[Its a possible one - but a desparate measure.  and none of the variations look too good. you should have got in here before the traingled stones were played  - with A

at this stage the side contact play looks better

And I still think that gently reducing white's moyo and expanding your own with B is better]

Please comment if you see any problems in the latter half of the game, thanks!

You would probably benefit by being a little less aggressive.

Try to go for the big areas on the board whilst keeping your own groups safe]
