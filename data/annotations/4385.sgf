C[RickMott [11k\]: Hi, pleased to meet you. :)
fauli [12k\]: hiho
fauli [12k\]: thx
fauli [12k\]: have fun

Dear Reviewer:  I won, but mostly by getting a few extra points in the endgame.  There were several complicated tradeoffs during the game, and I would like some help deciding whether they were reasonable or not.   I am not terribly good at using influence and playing a moyo game; i'm usually more fighting/territorial, but found myself forced into a moyo strategy here.  Thanks in advance for your advice!

thanks for the chance to review this game. It's an interesting game which you deserved to win on the whole. You were doing very well in building a moyo, but then a few loose moves in the middlegame let black reduce it a lot.]

(;B[qg]LB[qh:A]C[probably the wrong direction - this should be attacking from below, or enclosing the bottom corner. If playing from this direction, it may as well be at a]

;B[jc];W[dj]C[RickMott: I was happy at this point.  I thought Black should have played on the left first and kept me from getting san-ren-sei.

it's always hard to be definitive about the opening unless someone does something stupid, but here both your moves 10 and 12 are really cracking spots to play and black 7 and 9 are a little underwhelming]

(;B[hd]TR[fe][gf][hg][ih]C[RickMott: I thought this was a small move, but was uncertain how to make best use of sente.  Black has settled a lot of territory with 3 corners, so I felt I had to aim for a big moyo and still prevent Black from getting one in the upper right.

well black needs to add a move to defend the weakness at h17 and it's the largest area on the board at the moment, but i agree that this is not the way to do it. The marked spots represent the boundary between your moyo and black's and moves here are very large. Any move increasing your moyo, decreases black's, and vice versa. The difference between the two variations here should be obvious]

(;W[hf]C[very good move, for the reasons discussed before];B[jn]
C[RickMott: I didn't know what was the correct direction of play after this

funny move, somewhere near g/h10 looks more key - this is encouraging you to play near h8 to make your moyo bigger]

(;W[ij]C[RickMott:  One good overplay deserves another, I guess...  Trying to build a moyo in the upper left, put some pressure on black's stone, and prepare to reduce the upper right all at the same time.  Too ambitious?

if it comes down to a game of 'mine is bigger than yours' your moyo easily beats black's top right, so i wouldn't worry much about reduction yet. i think that you can be greedier in the centre however. this move begs black to play g7 or something, jumping into your moyo]

(;W[ed];B[fe]LB[kf:B][hm:A]C[this sequence is gote for black (as you rightly say, you don't need to defend the cuts) and solidifies the top. Thanks a lot!

the big areas are A and B  I would probably have played A, but after looking at for a while, maybe around B is better. Letting black play G6 hurts a lot though. it convinces me that J10 would have been better at H7]
;W[je]C[RickMott: I decided I could leave the cutting points C14, D13 in order to press down at the top.  Was that correct?]
;B[gn]C[this is pretty painful]
(;W[me]C[RickMott: I chose mutual reduction; would attacking Black's stones directly have been better?

letting blacks middle stones get away without any real attack seems a little slack, plus i think your moyo is bigger, so you have more to lose]

(;B[lq]TR[ko][kp]C[this move forces you to play around the marked spots, where you wouldlike to play anyway, so it seems likely to weaken the centre stones]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[lo];W[mp];B[ko];W[mq]C[not a great sequence for black, white takes some territory on the bottom, and the middle group doesn't exactly make any eye shape]
;B[lk]
(;W[in]TR[gn]C[RickMott: trying to separate Black by contacting his strong stones, but maybe something like M11 would be better?  Other suggestions?  Is it valid to try to keep some kind of attack going on the center stones?

cutting like this is probably not the way to attack the centre stones. The point of cuttting would be to capture the marked stone. The problem is that it will allow black leverage to sacrifice some stones and penetrate your moyo. 'don't play contact on stones you want to attack' is a basic rule which applies here. 

directly attacking the middle stones is hard to do, the best way to play is probably to surround more territory and build a bit more pressure on the middle stones]
;B[im];W[hm];B[io]C[this is a mistake for black i think - focussing more on the bottom than the more important middle left]
;W[hn];B[il];W[hl];B[ho]

yup. This reveals another weakness of the cutting move you played - it leads to a complicated fight in which it is easy to make mistakes]

there are situations in which black descending at k18 is dangerous to you but you defend appropriately when needed]

Thanks in advance for the review.  You get bonus points if you can tell me what the 2d's German commentary said... :)

d2 is dubious - i.e unnecessary and cost a point
k1 as well, and q13 so that was 3 free points you got at the end

the score is slightly wrong, i think - there's a point at d13 you need to fill eventually, plus you need to capture at S9 eventually.
But then there's 3 points that didn't get counted at p4, so you actually won by 8.5+3-2=9.5. On the whole you played much the better game of the two, but in the middle game you were a little soft territorially (e.g. around the middle left) which allowed black to get back in the game]
