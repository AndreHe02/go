C[Hello,  I am sending an attached game for review.  I used this
service
a couple of years ago and I found it very helpful then and have
stumbled
upon it again.  I have just started playing again and have come
against
a wall in my playing.   This game is indicative of many of my weaker points and hope
that some
critique can help.  Thank you in advance for your input.
My screen name is MrFreedom, in this game I was black and lost.

I am generally comfortable with my beginning and early game.
I'm
sure much more study will help; but my biggest challenge is reading
the
entire board and finding the strong points during middle game
especially.

I am weak with life and death most of the time and struggle often
in
fights. In this game I got lucky at taking a large group on
the right side of the board after an atari I placed on 2 stones
in the
middle of the side.  Then I got the group when I had 2 stones
in atari.

Luck!  I am struggling greatly it seems at moves 81 on...  then
91-117.

This is a confusing area for me and I know there were much better
places
to go but I get flustered.  Could you help me in this middle
game area?

Also, did I approach the upper corner too late? or am I just
too
inexperienced to try those now and succeed? (move 161)...  I
think there
is room to kill territory and live here but  Maybe this is too
late at
this point of the game?

Thank you again for your help.

In the opening. The first thing you have to do is to find the

2. sides
3. center

X rather than play B9.];W[qm]LB[pl:X][ql:X]C[W10 is too slow. May be at mark X.]

Better enclose the lower left corner.]

(;B[gh]C[this move does not help anything. see variation.

I'll end my comment here. You have a lot of chances to win the
game. This is not about techniques but about planning.
Remember, in the openning stage, you have to play the big moves
which are the moves on the 3rd and 4th line by following order:
1. Corners
2. Sides
3. Center

In the middle game. You have to make an attacking plan. Make
use of your opponent weakness to make profit. Push your opponent
toward your thickness. Don't play from your thickness.

I hope my comments would help. :-)
