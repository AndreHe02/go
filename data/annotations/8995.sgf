C[Overall, you played like a 17k, and white played like a 24k.

You did make several moves early in the game that either defended a single stone or attacked a single stone.  If the goal is simply to gain a point by killing a stone, this is unwise.  In the early game, each play must be worth 10 points or more (twice komi) or you're falling behind.  Even at the begining of the endgame, there are often many 4 point moves left.

Other than that, your game is pretty good.  You have a few rough edges that will improve as you play several games with stronger opponents.

Keep up the good work!  You're doing great!];B[pd];W[cd];B[pq]

Thus black needs to make both of the triangle points as eyes, (which white can easily prevent) or black must capture one of white's groups to escape, which doesn't look possible.]
