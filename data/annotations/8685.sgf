C[Kikunoji: Hi I played this game at IGS server, I won the game 
but I know that I did a lot of mistake, and I want some advice 
to improve my GO
Thank you for reviewing my game.

S: 

Hi, I'm your reviewer for this game. As always, as I am 6kyu on KGS, take my advices for what they worth. I will try to answer your questions and to give you some advices all along. I use some Japanese Go terms, if you don't know them you can go to http://senseis.xmp.net/?JapaneseGoTerms.

Let's Go !];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[ci]C[-----
S:

Here Black played the Chinese Fuseki : see http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseFuseki
B usually waits for W to invade and attack him, building territory / influence in the meantime.]
;W[dn]LB[gd:B][de:A][pj:D][fq:C]C[-----
S:

For what I know,  A is prefered to invade. Other possible moves : around B and C to limit black moyo and work well with your two hoshi corner stones. My personnal taste is to play D to get a san ren sei that somehow balance the Chinese fuseki.

I can see some possible drawbacks with your move at D6 :

- As it is a high approach move, it is harder to invade and live in the corner.
- Black can cut you from your Q4 stone, chasing you and building in the process.

This said, I can not say it is a bad move, let's see how it goes ...]
;B[fo]C[-----
S:

Black choose to attack and cut you from Q4. That was to be expected ^^]
(;W[co]LB[ck:A][fn:B][cp:C]C[-----
S:

A bit dangerous. Try to build a better base like A, more open to the center (see variation). Here Black can gain a lot by attacking around C8 (see var.). And if Black reinforce his corner (as in the game) he gets a big corner while you have to reinforce yourself ...

Playing A get you a base and see how Black goes on. 
Another idea is to go to the center with a move like B.
If you want to go to the corner you have C.

I suggest to get a base at A and keep the sansan invasion at C3 for later ...]
(;B[cp];W[ck]LB[co:A][cp:B]C[-----
S:

Yes, good. But I think you should have played it first, before the A-B exchange.]
;B[ei]
(;W[eo]C[kikunoji: here I think that i should play in another place but i want to attack his groupe and it was a bad exchange for me

-----
S:

Yes, this is a bad move :

- You should not attack from a weak group.
- A contact move is usually a defense move, not an attack one. Play from a distance to attack.
- If you want to cut a keima, the other side (E4) is usually better.
- This move gains you nothing, it forces black to get a strong group, with a lot of territory. Black says "Thank you !"
- Your shape is not a good one, see ? After Black play E4, He gains a forcing move at D5.

If your idea is to attack, you first have to strengthen your group.

See variations for some ideas.];B[ep];W[fn]
(;B[do]C[-----

Not the right time, I think. G5 is better for Black.];W[en]

G5 first for Black. This move can wait.];W[cm];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo]
;W[go];B[fp]C[kikunoji: here should not I protect the cut at g6??

-----
S:

Well, Black is solid, and you have some weaknesses, it seems wise to protect. This way you get strong and can see what Black will do.]

Maybe not the best way to protect the cut ^^];B[gn];W[gm];B[hn]

(;W[il]C[kikunoji: my groupe here was alredy alive and should not I play tenuki??

------
S:

Before this move, you are at a key point in the game. You have two stabilized groups, some territory, potential and sente. At such key points, you need to think about your strategy. Then you have to try to play the best move to serve this strategy. 

Your move is a contact move. Contact moves are usually for defense, as both player will usually strengthen themselves. As you can see in the game. If your idea was to attack Black you should not play like that. 

As there is some big points to get, you should get them first, and come back to attack black and get something in exchange.

See variations for some ideas.];B[ik];W[hk];B[hj];W[hl];B[jk]
TR[ij]SQ[il]C[------
S:

Here you can see that the only thing you have achieved with your squarred move (J8) is to reinforce black. You get no points, your group was already alive and strong. The only worst thing possible is you losing sente ^^

Black still had a weakness at J10 but overall, it is not a good result for White !]
;W[fd]LB[id:A]TR[ci][ei][fj][hj][gk][ik][jk]C[------
S:

Probably too close / too deep into Black zone of influence for a reduction. Black can pincer around A and you face Black influence (triangle stones)]
;B[de];W[ff]C[-----
S:

Hum, probably better to get a base first.If Black deny you a base, you are in trouble.]
;B[eg]C[-----
S:

Black gets a lot of territory while you lck a base ...];W[ej]
C[-----
S:

Why ? You only stregthen Black ... And he can even play tennuki ...

Try to avoid playing moves like this. At the least you can keep them as Ko threats.]
(;B[fi];W[id]C[-----
S:

Yes but probably too high for a base ...];B[kd];W[md]C[-----
S:

It is good fighting spirit. The problem you have in this situation, is that your J16 group is weak, facing Black influence. Black is doing a splitting attack. If Black does not make mistakes, you will not be able to get J16 alive and gain points to the east. It is a way to reduce your potential.]
;B[ke]C[-----
S:

In such situation the one space jump (tobi) is better (L14). L15 is slow / heavy. Black's mistake ^^]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[jg]C[kikunoji: here my idea was to kill his ivasion but instead of that i kill my self, how should i do for the invasion m16 here??

-----
S:

Not really an invasion. More a reduction / spliting attack. It is hard to kill Black as you are weak, and Black can use his influence. But he has made mistakes (nobi instead of tobi) so you can get more than expected. 

In any case, remember a great advice : Attacking is NOT killing. Killing is usually hard, and if you are not sure about the killing, your best tactics is to attack from the right direction to get points / influence while Black thrive to survive ^^

Of course if in the meanwhile you can kill, do it ^^

In your situation, you have a weak group. Attacking from a weak group is usually not effective as you have to reinforce yourself.

That's why a basic rule of thumb is :

- First, strengthen your weak groups
- Second, attack opponent's weak groups to gain territory/influence (attack not kill ^^)

That basically what you are doing here. But has black has split you he can attack N16 after your reinforcement.

The more you push, the more you weaken N16.];B[kg]
(;W[jh]C[-----
S:

Better to reinforce N16 while attacking Black heavy stick shape ...]
(;B[kh]C[-----
S:

You are lucky Black wants to follow you ...]
(;W[ji]LB[ij:A]C[------
S: 

this one is not that bad as it threaten the cut as A. But it is usually better to cut than to threaten to cut, unless you read the cut does not work ^^]
;B[ki]
(;W[kj]C[-----
S:

You like complex fights ^^
Better to play a move on the right side. If black connects, you will have another move to get territory ...]

Good !];B[pj]LB[qc:A][qp:D][rp:C][qq:B]C[------
S:

Too small. A seems to be the biggest point left, but I'm not good at counting points ^^
An invasion at B, C, D seems possible too because of the aji in this zone, but more difficult to handle.]
;W[nm];B[mn]C[------

Way too small ! Say 'thank you' to black ^^];W[nn]

[kd][ke][kf][kg][kh][mi][oj][pj]C[-----
S:

too small !!! 
Do not answer your opponent's move blindly !

Look at the goban, you should see that your 3 stones in the upper left corner are weak facing black wall, an invasion at A or anywhere in this part of the goban is the first thing to handle ! You should have played there when you get sente many moves ago ! If black invades you will probably lose ...

Even if the upper right corner were settled, there is really BIGGER move to play like the circled ones ...

Your P8 move is really the last one to play ^^];B[nj];W[li]
LB[qc:A]C[------
S:

Again, too small. I will not say it for now on, but preventing an invasion in the upper right corner is the FIRST thing to do. Then you can consider yose moves, beginning by double sente one's, sente one's, biggest gote one's, etc.]
