C[oxgo [4k?\]: hello
adaptor [4k\]: hi,];B[pp]C[Dear reviewer thanks for taking time to review my game. I am playing white.

Zordon:
Hi oxgo!
Thank you for the interesting game. The review was a lot of fun. The game was full of difficult decisions and I had to think about some positions for a long time. I hope you can enjoy the review. Please let me know if you have any further questions!

abstract:
In the opening black made some mistakes and white got a good result. 
Later black built a framework on the left side and white tried to reduce it by any means. doing that white became attackable. 
However black did not start any attack but got under attack himself. While trying to kill blacks right group white somehow lost the view for the whole board and got seperated. 
Now the weak groups white built to reduce blacks framework became a problem. White had several chances to win the game anyhow but in the end black could capture some stones and win the game.

I think white played strong go in the beginning and lost because the late middle game was very confusing. If white had not been that afraid of blacks framework and had kept his groups together the game would have been easy for him.]

;W[pf];B[qb]C[Zordon: Black could not play any Joseki so he tried to set up a base.]

;B[od]C[At this point, I was wondering to play S19 to make the Q17 group running but I wanted to do it later and first I tried to reduce black framework on the left.

Zordon: 
You can either try to attack the group now and make some profit like reducing blacks left side, or you try to get some stones in the center first and then kill the group. It is not easy to kill the group however and you have to be careful if you attack hard.

Also Don't forget that you did not answer G5 yet. normally one would play G3 as an answer.  Because of that your next move might be an overplay.]
(;W[bn];B[an];W[em]LB[en:A][fp:B]C[Zordon:

(;B[bl];W[dj];B[ci];W[hm]C[I was quite satisfied with this result

Zordon: Black played very submissive so the result looks okay. The group is pretty heavy though and the black group is really solid.

Instead F13 is a good way to reduce the left side and G3 is the move of choice in my opinion.]
;B[lg];W[li];B[ra]C[It seems as if I had M11 for free. But now that the Q17 group is alive I have no more forcing move...

So was the decision to postpone the S19 play a good one or not ?

Zordon: 
I would have attacked it directly. The outside influence would have made it easier to reduce the left side. Anyhow you did not only get M11, you also got sente though it was blacks turn.]

[sf][qg][rg][sg][aq][ar][br][cr][dr][as][bs][cs][ds][es]C[I think that this is a turning point for the game.

I have read that e15 cannot be taken but I think I missed the fact that it gives black to many forcing moves.

But I must confess that I was quite out of good ideas. Perhaps I should have played around O3.

What I would like to know here is what would be your strategy ? Do you think that the game is from now on only a teritory contest or is there some group to attack ? What could white aim at ?

Zordon: 
First off e15 is a mistake (see later).
If you need to decide your strategy its helpful to count territory and estimate influence. I am not very good at counting but I would say:
Black left: 17  white top left: 13
Black top right: 2 white top :5
Black bottom right: 21 white bottom left: 10
  white top right: 9
black: 40  white 37 + 6.5

White has a heavy group in the center and little prospects at the bottom whereas black could make some additional points at the bottom. After the fight around e15 white should do something about the bottom. Its the only interesting area right now. I would simply play G3. it looks a little slow but it also helps the group in the center. And I think that group is likely to come under attack some time.]

Zordon: Indeed. That is why it shouldn't be there in the first place. The game looks rather difficult for white now.]

Think about whats really important. the left group is already alive. You need to save the group in the bottom right, the top group and the group on the left. It sounds like much to do but it can be done. Trying to kill blacks right group however is a little much right now.]
