AB[dd][dp][pd]C[So I've been trying to teach myself go for a couple of months now. It's been hard, since no-one in my area plays at all. I've tried KGS, but very few people of my level frequent.

This is a recent game between me and my computer tutor, gnugo, level 0.

CJT - Hi, I'll mark my comments CJT throughout.

First off - good for you starting Go, I was in a pretty similar situation too, where I've taught a couple of friends to play, buut they didn't care as much as me ;-P and yes it's sometimes hard to find sensible opponents online.  However, if you keep trying online, and get a stable rating, the chances are you'll begin to learn really quickly (I should take my advice really - I haven't played online for too long!).  Playing against a computer is a good start but I found it very annoying because even on easy settings the computer knows too much joseki etc - which is not worth wasting time on early on...  Also SL is a fantastic resource - highly recommend you keep looking there for ideas.

Right - on with the review...

Overall comments at the end...];W[op];B[pn];W[fc];B[hc]C[In contrast to my previous games, I'm trying to fend off white's attacks with some more aggressive joseki's I've found, mostly from sensei's Library

CJT - Yes this is the right idea.  With a handicap you can often afford to be a bit more aggressive (or at least you should try...)]
;W[fe];B[df];W[fg];B[dh]C[CJT - Good for B to here...];W[cj]
C[I never know how to fend off this kind of incursion. Playing at C11 seems far too limiting, and B11 never seems to work in my favor.

CJT - Yes this is a deliberate attempt to start a fight.]
(;B[gq]LB[cl:a][cm:b]C[CJT - You had the right idea here - but much better is A or B, which both secores some territory in the corner, and puts pressure on the lone W stone.

Especially in the opening, if you see a move that has two purposes like this, it's usually a good one!]
;W[cm]C[CJT - Now W was able to stabilise a bit on the left...]
;B[mp]LB[mq:a]C[CJT - Good - having played 10, you at least make some use of it...

Even better is A though I think since that really threatens the entire corner, along with Q6...]
;W[no];B[jp]C[CJT - Now N4 looks much better at N3 - if only because it strengthens a later follow-up at P3...]
;W[qp];B[ql]LB[pj:a][pn:b]C[CJT - I prefer something like A here - it would leave B weaker, but as it is you have two stones that are two close together (heavy).  They're not really making any territory, or attacking, and you can't afford to sacrifice them.  If you can worry less about protecting B and remember to play the whole board you'll find you get more efficient in the opening (but not an easy thing to do :-P)]
;W[pf]
(;B[qh]C[In retrospect, I think I would have played O17

CJT - I don't like O17 actually - see variation...

This looks like absolutely the right move to me...

Attacks the W stone, protects the weak lower pair - dual purpose...]
;W[og]
(;B[mn]C[It's about here i realize I have far too little influence, and attempt to block off white on the bottom of the board.

CJT - This I think was your mistake.  The top-right corner needs some protection - and the H17 stone could use some help too (as you soon find out...)]
;W[jc];B[he];W[if]LB[lc:a]C[After move 22, should I have just let white have that stone?

CJT - 22 is much better at A - you put pressure on W, and have the option to save or abandon the other stone later...

Again notice the double meaning to this move - help the corner and attack the W stone...]
;B[eb]LB[lc:a][jd:b][fb:c]C[CJT - A is still good here... W can't let you follow up with B for example...

24 is ok if you really need to connect to the 2 stones underneath (with C) but here you can apply some pressure and improve your position.

Note that at this point I think you have a >20 point lead (based on my rubbish score estimating skills!)]
;W[mc];B[qf];W[fb]C[CJT -  I think you mis-read this move - it's not an attack on the top-left corner, but rather on the two other stones, to prevent you connecting to your corner.]
(;B[ec]LB[ch:a][rn:b][ne:c][pc:d]C[CJT - Which makes this a bit of a wasted move...

There's nothing good I can see to save the two stones without lots of complications, but there are much bigger moves on the board - A, B, C, D to name but a few...

Here you have to be careful not to just react to your opponent - the sequence (if you ignore 27) should be easy enough to read out.]
;W[rn]C[again, for some reason I hate playing diagonals. It just doesn't feel aggressive enough, and gives white a nice little wall.]
;B[ej];W[bp];B[cq];W[gd];B[je]C[Here, I tried to play tricky and limit whites influence on that side. I think I did fairly well, to tell you the truth.]
;W[ie];B[kf]C[CJT - Hmm.  I don't particularly like those last two moves... What I did here was to look at the final position, where the stones 34 and 36 form part of a large clump in the center, which gains you maybe 2 points at a stretch (more like 0) - and the two to the left are dead.

I prefer leaving the two to their fate after W33 - and taking a big move elsewhere.  Then you can make it W who wasted a move instead...]
;W[bh]
(;B[bf]C[Could I have played at B13 instead? I felt this move lost me a lot of points.

CJT - I think you have to play B14 here - see variation for B13]
;W[ig];B[mg]C[CJT - this move seems quite aimless.  The two W stones are not attacked strongly since O15 I think lets W connect...

I much prefer O15 here - this links up your stones better, and also isolates the two W stones.]
(;W[oi];B[pj]C[Here I debated for a while between Q10 and R10, but felt I needed more influence.

CJT - this is the correct move.  R10 gives W too much space.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[bq];B[dr]C[I had never played this fall back on the second line before, and never seen it, but for some reason it felt right.

I'd seen it work well on the first line, and wondered if it held the same life-giving power on the second  line

CJT - First, this is not a very urgent move.  Imagine if you don't play - W puts a stone at C2, then you play D2, W B2 - nothing has changed from here except W has handed you the initiative for a point or two - something you should be encouraging :-P

I would have played another move 015/O10? to put pressure on the weak W group.

If you need to play in this corner, then B2 is safe in this situation.]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[qb];B[rd]C[CJT - This is almost identical to the question you asked earlier.  Again I think S18 is safe, but I might have been tempted to play safe (but at S17, not S16) because of the lurking Q14 stone...]
;W[nk];B[ne]C[Here, feeling threatened by whites enclosure, I attempt to connect with a knights jump (possibly a bad move, but it seemed to work.)

CJT - as I think I've suggested, this move is too late - it should be you forcing W to escape with O9...  Then you could have prevented N11 next move...]
;W[mi];B[kh]C[CJT - I agree with this move - it keeps up some pressure after N11 - and eats into a bit of the center territory.]
;W[kj]
(;B[pe]C[Through practice, I've found that this shape I created with Q15, Q16, and O15 is really strong with no immediate white stones. Is there a name for this?

CJT - this looks like a good move - protecting against the cut.  However, in this case I don't think it was necessary - see variation.]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[pm];B[em];W[kl];B[hn]LB[jm:a]C[My shapes always seem to contain this weak double-diag at H6 and K4.

CJT - I'm never too sure about moves like this - I think I probably play too conservatively too.  However, in this scenario a move like A looks perfectly playable.]
;W[hk];B[dl];W[cl];B[gl];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[cb];W[nr];B[mr]
;W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[kr];W[oh];B[pi]C[CJT - I think this is a wasted move.  At this point you are marginally ahead - so it is moves like this that give your opponent sente in the endgame that cost you I think.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[ol];B[kn];W[rb];B[gi];W[gh];B[gj]C[I REALLY like this shape.]

;B[ee];W[bd]C[Crap.

Forgetting about those two stones was a horrible mistake. After a little reading, I decide to simply do damage control.]

[bj][bk]C[I thought I was doing relatively well, but the 14.5 point loss says otherwise.

One of the problems from learning from a computer better than you is that there is no such thing as a learning game. gnuGo is doing its best to crush me each and every time, and I've got it dialed back as far as it can go.

I'm hoping that whoever reviews this can give me some basic tips. I'm hoping that I can get to 15k soon. Then there'll be some more humans on KGS I can actually play with.

Thanks very much for listening to the ramblings of a newbie.

CJT - Right, going through this review I was trying to find out the main things you did wrong, and all along there were some minor points where you could have done better, but still somehow ended up ahead.

That all changed when you entered the end-game (actually started around move 67 rather surprisingly!).  You gave your opponent far too many free moves, which (being a computer makes this particularly easy) your opponent was able to claw a few points back with each.

I confess that end-game counting is very tedious for the most part, and you're unlikely to beat a computer (even on easiest settings) at it any time soon - so what you need to do is keep control, and be making at least half of the end-game sente plays.

This will mean occasionally ignoring an opponents move, when you decide it is not a threat.  You made responses to many moves that didn't require it - where you could have looked around the board looking for the best option, rather than reacting.  Working backwards I spotted 169, 167, 155, 153, 149 as just the first few.

Even if you're not always right, if you take a step back, think "where on the entire board is the best place to play", doing your best to ignore your opponents last move - and have a reason - at least you'll know why you did it, and why you were right/wrong afterwards.  This applies to the whole game, not just the end.  Unfortunately, as you'll find, it's very difficult to stop yourself just reacting to an opponenets stone!

Hope you found the review helpful - hope you get up to 15k soon!]
