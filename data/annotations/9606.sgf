C[Hello Noel,

My name is Martin. I am currently playing at the 3k level on KGS, under the pseudo Tictoc. I am glad to review your game and I hope it will be useful. Please note that French is my mother tongue, so I might make a few English mistakes here and there.

I will be focusing on the two aspects of the game you have mentioned in your presentation:
1. Early strategic situation (fuseki). The question being whether you had the advantage before the middle game.
2. White's comeback. How could you make a better job at limiting it.

If I see something else that I consider important, I will point it out.

Please note that I do not like writing lots of alternate play sequences: I feel that at some point, they just clutter up the review and cover up the essential comments.

I've stopped at move 119, because at this point, the whole game hinged on yose calculation and I do not feel quite ready to give pointers on such a topic!

A nice game overall. I think you did deserve to win.

Best,
Martin];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce];W[jc];B[hc];W[mc];B[cj]
LB[qg:C][fp:A][fq:B]C[Not a big mistake, but not the best move either. Now you have four stones in the upper left, nothing on the lower side. Balance is important in fuseki. So is discerning the biggest side to play on. Here, the left sde is not so big, because there are stones on the third line on both ends.

In short, this play is not big enough, and it's overconcentrated.

If you ask: since you are already strong in the upper left, having white play on the left side before you is not much of a problem.

Personnaly, I would have tried to put a stone on the lower side. It is the biggest side at this point. "A" feels quite efficient, but "B" and "C" also good.]
;W[qc]C[A mistake by white: He's helping you build influence early, and in the direction of his group on the upper side. In short, he is giving you a stick to beat him with, all this for ten points.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qf];W[rf]
;B[qg];W[jq]TR[cm][dm]C[Now, the inefficiency of C10 shows itself, because now a good response to K3 would be C7 or D7 (triangles). But now, these options are too tightly connected to C10. It would be too slow to play them.]
;B[ie];W[ib];B[hb];W[kb];B[la]TR[jj][kj][jk][kk]SQ[jo]C[This is your second mistake.

It's too early in the game for this. And you will not kill him this way. If you want too keep this white group under pressure, find options that will permit you to take profit while doing so. M19 does not give you anything. It just forces white to try and get out, and this could become a problem with your rather unwieldy position on the upper right.

I'd consider playing in the centre (triangles): it would affect both the small white group in the upper side, and the large, but vague white framework on the lower side. Of course, it also works well with your upper left moyo.

You could also dive much deeper, pushing down on white's stones (square).

Whatever you choose, your influence toward the centre would be nice.]
;W[ma];B[mb];W[lb];B[na];W[ka];B[ma];W[ld];B[kf]TR[jo][fp][eq]
C[Not very useful. Now that the upper side is moslty settled, the lower part of the board is very important. Since you are not even present down there, you have to use sente to act fast and light (triangles).]
;W[ke]C[This is white giving you a second chance to act down there...]
;B[jf]C[Of course, it's allright to close white in, but is it counterbalancing the fact that he will now complecte is lower side position?]
;W[fq]TR[la][kf][cj]C[Despite my critics concerning the triangled move, I think you are right in assessing that your position is a bit better at that point. You're about even in points, but your influence toward the centre is stronger, and you have sente.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po]
(;B[pn]LB[rn:A][jo:B]C[This starts an old joseki that is not as interesting as it seems. Better to solidify the corner in sente with "A", then press the lower side down with something like "B".]
;W[qo];B[ro]
(;W[rn]TR[pn]C[Big mistake by white: he should have cut from the other side. Because of this, you're getting out of your Q6 error with a profit.]
;B[rm];W[rp];B[sn];W[rq]TR[ql]C[To me, this is excellent for you: he has the corner, but you get a ponnuki, and sente.

His pincer stone has become useless, and he will compound his mistake by trying to save it!]
;B[pl]LB[ql:B][nn:A]C[A mistake. You must know the phrases: "never connect with a weak stone", and "attack from a a distance".

You do not want to play a move that will kill instantly, that is impossible. You want to find a move that will make an advantageous position even better. Do not hurry in killing the weak: he might get stronger, if you try to push him around...

"A" seems like a better option: it gives you influence toward the centre, it disturbs the lower side, and it builds options for the right side, including attacking B later.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[qj];B[pi]LB[ql:A]C[White also has a problem in determining the most important work to do on the board. In trying to save A, he has given you another wall toward the centre. This is worth much more.]
;W[rh];B[ri]TR[pj]C[If, at the moment of playing this, you thought you had a real chance at killing white, then it's a good move. If you were certain that you were going to get out of this exchange with sente, then it is still a good move. But if you were not certain of either, then it's reckless, because you are weakening your outside wall in the process. This wall is more important than the small white development under it.

If white gets out with sente, he will enlarge his lower side moyo.

In short, if I had to play in that area, I think I would go for Q10. Simple, boring maybe, but having such a solid wall gives lots of options.]
;W[rj];B[qh];W[rg];B[oo]TR[pj]C[This would work much better if you had a stone at Q10, instead of S11. Now, it is diffficult to say what will happen if white decides to cut, because your right side wall has holes in it. things might go well, or not.]
;W[np];B[no];W[mp];B[op]C[Sente, but aji keshi: it gives away aji. And your black stones loose one liberty, so you're forced to continue pushing. If not... (variation starting on move 68)

Keep those moves as ko threats];W[oq]
(;B[mo];W[lp];B[ko];W[oe];B[pe];W[mf];B[lh]LB[jj:B][pj:A]C[I'm not sure about this one. The problem is that your right side wall has important weaknesses. Basically, on the upper right, the right side and the lower right, you've given white the possibility to build rock solid positions. The good thing is that their influence is minumal, but the bad thing is that in forcing them to solidify, you've build weak defences.

Here, Q10 is full of possibilities for white (A). This makes the right side cadran doubtful to build territories. So M12 is not so strong. Maybe something more polyvalent, toward the centre (B)?]

(;W[gj];B[gl];W[fk];B[dl]LB[cm:A]C[It is obvious that White can go through, so D8 is purposeless. C7 could have been better, because it still put pressure on the white stones, while taking territory on the side.]

(;W[fl];B[en]LB[cn:A]C[This only destroys. Try to make territory while you threaten white (A).]
;W[gm]C[White is safe.];B[hl];W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[ep];W[eq]
;B[fh]C[Good sequence: first a peep, then defense. You had to take sente to defend in the upper left.

At this point, I also think that you have a better game, but white has weaknesses to exploit.]
;W[fp];B[ij]LB[nh:C][pj:A][lo:B]C[Defending the upper left is more important, because your centre is very weak (A-C).]
;W[hi];B[hg];W[ei];B[dh];W[fi]C[A mistake by white.];B[eh];W[pj]
LB[ri:A][ko:B][lo:C]C[This might be the main point of my review: white was able to stage a comeback because you left many important weaknesses behind. At this point, would you not change your stone at S11 (A) for a stone at Q10? Or your stone at L5 (B) for a stone at M5 (C)?

White is not stronger than you in fighting, he just has more weaknesses to use.]
;B[oj];W[oi]C[Please note that I am reviewing as I read the the game. So, now, I have to say "I told you so" :)]
;B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[qi];B[ph]
(;W[lo]C[A mistake by white. He has to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the centre (variation on move 105)]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[km];W[mn];B[lm];W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[jn]
;B[jm];W[in]LB[ri:B][ko:A]C[A and B are the answer you're looking for to explain this mess. As you can see with variation on move 105, things could have been worse.

It's often said that one of the important differences between strong players and not-so-strong one is patiently playing the necessary simple moves, knowing that every overstretched debt will be repaid with interests later.

I will not comment on the rest, as you've started a yose that was not very aggressive. In the end, it was all about who would do a bit better than the other in the very last moves.

So I think the opening was even, because if you had more potential, you also had more weaknesses. White's attack was not nasty enough, so you got away with it.]

(;B[rn];W[om];B[jo]C[Please note that the situation in the corner is better for black than in the old joseki variation that start on move 47. This is because the points are about the same, but the corner is not completely sealed in and white is not in control.]
