;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[fc];W[df];B[jd];W[nq]C[RickMott: White is making low moves here.  It would be better to add a stone to A1 corner, or perhaps approach T19.  3rd line is good for territory, but that doesn't fit with high moves in a19 corner...]
;B[cn]C[RickMott: Black is playing far from your stone, so not very threatening.]
;W[cp]C[RickMott: This is too safe.  I would pincer from the other side, to aim to build territory in top left while attacking.]
;B[cj];W[ch]C[RickMott: Once you have made the very strong corner, and Black extends three spaces, I would split him with C9.  He could make good shape now by playing at D10 or D6, or he could tenuki for a big point on the right side.]
;B[ce];W[cc]C[RickMott: Don't worry about the corner here.  Connect your stones at D15.  You will become very strong and some black stones on the left will die eventually.]
;B[cf]C[RickMott: This was a mistake.  Black should have cut at D15.]
;W[dg]C[RickMott: And you should still connect.  So now he cuts on the next move.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[bh]C[RickMott: This is the wrong side.  You were lucky; if Black cuts at E16, you would have problems.]
;W[bg]C[RickMott: good response.  How you should be able to catch the 3 stones.]
;B[cg];W[bi];B[dh];W[ah];B[ci];W[eg]C[RickMott: Don't give Black the ko.  Just connect.  You have 4 liberties to his 3, and should win.  Black's scary-looking ataris on the outside don't go anywhere.]
;B[bh]C[RickMott: and now there's no ko threat you can make that's big enough.  But you should at least take a big point for free, not keep fighting locally.]
KO[];W[bf];B[ch]C[RickMott: ko was a big win for Black, going from one dead and one weak group to a strong group possibly killing white stones.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[bd];B[ae];W[eh]C[RickMott: connecting at E16 is much better.  This cut point will cause you problems.]
;B[ed]C[RickMott: and Black takes it immediately.  Now instead of one strong group, you have two weak ones.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fe]C[RickMott: protect the enclosed group first.  Black might kill your corner.  I would play E18 here.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[bb]C[RickMott: strong move.  White's corner should die...]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[jc]C[RickMott: What are you trying to do with this cut?  Black should simply atari at L17 and drive you to the edge of the board.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb]C[RickMott: Black gave you a break.  Running along the 2nd line is not good. You should capture the cutting stone at K16 with the ladder at K15.  Then your center group is at least strong, even if you're still behind.  The biggest problem I see in your game so far is that you're too eager to cut your opponent without worrying enough about keeping your own groups connected.  Defend first, then attack from strength.]
;W[mc];B[je]C[RickMott: and now he's cut your groups apart again.]
;W[pf]C[RickMott: Again, this stone doesn't help any of your problem groups.  What will you do if Black cuts at G15 next?]
;B[nb]C[RickMott: But fortunately he doesn't.  This is an overly cautious move.]
;W[nc];B[ob];W[rd]C[RickMott: You still have the G15 weakness, and this stone can be cut.  As Black, I would play R15 almost without thought.  One of the three white groups would be certain to die.]
;B[od]C[RickMott: Black lets you off the hook again here.  Better start worrying about saving the eyeless 17th line group.]
;W[me]C[RickMott: Good thinking.  If you protect that G15 cut next, this will work.]
;B[jg];W[oc];B[pc];W[gf]C[RickMott: Good move, prevents immediate catastrophe.]
;B[ih];W[pn];B[gh];W[fi];B[gg];W[ek]C[RickMott: This move doesn't attack Black's center group.  You need to take away his potential eye space and surround him, while making eyes for your own weak group.  Threatening to cut at J14 is probably better.]
;B[hf]C[RickMott: whereas this steals an eye from you and makes shape for Black.  Big difference.]
;W[ff]C[RickMott: should be at F18 to ensure an eye.  Black could make this one false too with F13.]
;B[he];W[ge];B[fg];W[ef];B[dl]C[RickMott: Black could capture instead with E11 atari, you connect, F10 atari, you run, G10 atari, you run, and Black nets at J10.
[GTL: Rick added later on:
I found an error in the capture sequence I proposed for black against the big white upper center group.  You can escape the immediate net by playing atari against the stone at E11.  However, if black then connects at H10 you must take E11, which is a false eye.  Black can then enclose you with a move around F7 or so.  Your group will still not be able to live, and black's center group can't really be attacked.
\]];W[dk]C[RickMott: this move doesn't fix the problem.  Black can still capture starting with E11.  You should connect out at F10.]
;B[cl]C[RickMott: but he misses it.];W[el]C[RickMott: but you still don't connect!]
;B[dn];W[ck];B[bk];W[il]C[RickMott: What is your goal here?  This move doesn't seem to aim at anything in particular.  It's too far from the endangered center group to help, and it doesn't support any of your other single stones.]
;B[of]C[RickMott: your 17th line group may get into trouble now.]
;W[mg];B[pg];W[og]C[RickMott: Crosscut gives your opponent the choice of direction.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[mi];B[oh];W[rg]C[RickMott: Black has so many choices here.  He can cut at N12 and the 17th line group will probably die.  He can push through the weakness at R15 and kill something.  And the E11 sequence still works.]
;B[mk]C[RickMott: but this move doesn't do any of it.];W[kj]
C[RickMott: thinking to attack Black's center group?];B[lh]
;W[mh];B[jj];W[lj]C[RickMott: Can't afford to let Black get out at K9.  How about K11?]
;B[jk];W[mj]C[RickMott: wasted move.  Doesn't attack, not needed for defense.]
;B[gl];W[fm];B[hl];W[gn];B[fo];W[eo]C[RickMott: You really, really need to see that the E14 and E9 groups can be cut apart.  This maybe the last of your many last chances to connect them.]
;B[en];W[fn];B[ep];W[go];B[do];W[eq];B[ej]C[RickMott: This isn't right for Black.  You get a last chance to at least try to escape with F10.]
;W[fj]C[RickMott: so you take it, but I don't think it works.]
;B[ei];W[fh]
(;B[fk]
(;W[gj]C[RickMott: from here on it's hopeless, I'm afraid.  Black is too far ahead.  As I said, your biggest strategic problem is failing to keep your groups connected first.  Fix that, and you'll  be several stones stronger very soon.  Good luck!  (end of comments for the game)]
;B[fl];W[em];B[hj];W[oo];B[fq];W[fr]C[RickMott: One last comment.  If black lets you enclose him in the lower right, you should play 3-3 and try to kill him there.]
