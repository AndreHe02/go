AB[dd][pp]C[MR: Please find comments for GTL always starting wit "MR".

MR: The game is characterized by local fighting by both sides ... with both sides seemingly afraid of really catching groups or going through the fight altogether in general. This happens in the lower left (white allows black to catch stones instead of catching stones himself), in the upper left (black only cuts of small part of the group), in not catching the middle left white group (white can poke his head out while black indicates being afraid of surrounding) etc. So my recommendation would be to think first before entering fights and then to read every now and then whether it is possible to follow through instead of begging away because of being afraid ....]

(;B[gm]C[MR: Looks like overplay. Installing a weak black group on the lower side gives white the opportunity to build strenth on the outside.]
;W[jo];B[kq];W[lq];B[jq];W[lp];B[hr];W[hm];B[gl];W[el]C[MR: White decides to make himself a weak group while keeping the black stondes G7-G8 separate. 
This might not be good in general, but in this game black already showed that white can gain in making it a fighting game ...]

(;W[cj];B[dh];W[ch];B[dg];W[bf];B[fj];W[cc]C[MR: Both sides somehow stabilized themselves - black does not have a weak group in the middle anymore while established a group on the left side. However, this is not a logical continuation to W E8.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[de]C[MR: Black built a wall ... but in gote ... so white can play around K16 to make the wall more or less worthless.]

(;B[ck]C[MR: Why take only a few stones when you can (at least try to) catch the whole group? C9 does not run away anyway, as it is totally unimportant for white as soon as he has connected to the outside.]
