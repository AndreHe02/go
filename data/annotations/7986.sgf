AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Psi: Hello, i am PsiGoLogic.

At move 236 I added a summary,
you may look at first.

Feel free to contact me on my KGS account when you have questions.]
;W[dd];B[mc]LB[pj:a][jp:b]C[Psi:  
The advantage of a hoshi stone (= 4-4 corner stone), is his flexibility. 
Because the hoshi stone can be used to build a moyo (=territorial framework), to gain influence (=good for fighting) or to make territory, depending on the whole board situation. 

The extension of Black 2 is a territorial move, but after Black 2 White can still invade your corner by playing R17 or attack your corner effectively with R16 (see next variations).

Black 2 is locally not bad, but at this stage of the game i would prefer A or B, because A and B 
1. work as extensions of "two" corners stones, 
2. build a moyo together with the corner stones,
3. and keep the flexibility of the hoshi stone.]
(;W[pe]C[Psi: White 3 at Q15 is a mistake because:

1. White should attack the other hoshi stones,
since those are less fortified and want to extend next,

2. White could later choose an attack that appropriate depending on the whole board situation,

3. Q15 attacks at the top right corner at the wrong place, and helps Black to fortify the corner (see variations).]
(;B[qe]C[Psi: I would prefer R16 in this situation (see variation).]
;W[pf]
(;B[qf]TR[qd][od][pc]C[Psi: I would prefer R16 (see variation), because:

1. R14 is pushing from behind (usually bad),
2. R14 leaves some weakness around Q16 which White may use to make shape.]
(;W[nd]C[Psi: White 7 should be at P16 (see variation).]
(;B[od]C[Psi: Black P16 gives White the opportunity to seperate N17 from the other stones .

A basic principle of Go is to keep your stones connected (see variation).]
;W[nc];B[ne];W[md];B[me]
(;W[oe]TR[pf][pe]C[Psi: White makes an empty triangle - a bad shape - .

White should push on instead with M16 (see variation).]
(;B[pg]C[Psi: Squeezing is not bad, but black could first play M16 (see variation).]
;W[ld];B[le];W[of]C[Psi: White makes an ugly shape and helps black to become stronger.]
;B[og];W[nf]C[Psi: White can not escape.]
(;B[mf]TR[le][me]C[Psi: Here Black makes an empty triangle without necessity (see variations).]
;W[cn]C[Psi: I would prefer L18, since White O17 group is not settled yet.

But White also plays C6 to distract Black from the ladder and finaly play a ladder braker.]
(;B[bo]LB[fq:a][ng:b]C[Psi: B5 is possible (but regarded as greedy).

Standard response to the small knight's move (=keima) corner approach (here C6) would be A.

A tenuki (play elsewhere) would also be possible,
so here Black could play B before White plays a ladder breaker (see variation).]
;W[fo]C[Psi: White F5 is ladder breaker.];B[fp]C[Psi: Now the ladder works again.]
;W[ng]C[Psi: A mistake since the ladder works.]
(;B[oc]TR[od][pd]C[Psi: Black should play the ladder (see variation).
instead of creating an empty triangle.];W[lc]C[Psi: White O13 group should escape with N13 instead.]
;B[nb]TR[me][mf][ne][le]C[Psi: Black 28 is a mistake.

Even if the ladder would not work, Black should strengthen N15 group instead of createing more weakness.]
;W[mb]C[Psi: White could save O13 group instead.];B[pj]C[Psi: Now black looses the last chance to play the ladder.
Also N15 is more urgent than making a moyo.];W[mh]C[Psi: O13 group escapes from the ladder but is still not safe.

Also N13 would have been better than O13, since it would put more pressure on N15 and does not allow Black forcing moves like O12 or N13.]
;B[nj]TR[ke]C[Psi: It is urgent to save M15 group by playing L15 because:

1. Black M15 group seperates / isolates White O14 group which is still in danger,

2. Black M15 group might will prevent a white moyo.];W[lh];B[kf]
;W[kh];B[go]TR[if]C[Psi: A jump to J14 is more urgent.];W[fn]
C[Psi: White should ignore G5 and play on top or left side, because:
1. F5 does neither seperate black stones nor make territory,
2. F6 makes the white stones only heavy,
so Black can later attack those stones and make territory.]
;B[gn]C[Psi: J14 still urgent.
Also G6 is pushing from behind (usually bad).]
(;W[jq]C[Psi: 
White 39 is a mistake because:
1. White chooses a wrong point for the invasion (see variation),
2. the invasion is also a too early,
since an invasion makes the defending stones stronger, and will therefore lead to losses on other parts of the board.

White should attack M15 instead because:
1. by attacking M15 White could make a moyo that is equal to blacks moyo,
2. White would strengthen his stones what makes an invasion or reduction of Blacks moyo more easy.]
(;B[hq]TR[mq]C[Psi: H3 is the wrong direction.
To attack K3 Black has to prevent White from making a base.
But H3 leaves a good two space extension for White (see variation).]
(;W[nq]C[Psi: The three-space extension of O3 is a bit thin, because of the black stones that surround the O3 group.
In regard of the surrounding a two-space extension to N3 would have been more secure for white (see variation).]
(;B[lq]C[Psi: I would prefer O4 (see variations) because
White next can attack the corner from two sides by playing R6.

A splitting move like M3 would better when the right corner would be more secure.]
;W[lr]LB[qn:a][qq:b]C[Psi: It would be better for White to attack the corner, by playing at A or invading at B instead of crawling along the bottom.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[np];W[oq];B[op];W[pq]
(;B[qq]TR[qp]C[Psi: I would prefer R4 (see variation), because R3 leaves a cutting point at R4.]
;W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[ko]TR[mp][qp]C[Psi: M5 seems safer (the cutting point less dangerous).]
;W[kq]C[Psi: L3 connects but is not big.];B[kp]C[Psi: L4 does not threat White and does not secure much points.
It looks more like banging with a head against a wall. 

Black has lot of options to play elsewhere.];W[qn]C[Psi: Such a deep invasion is difficult, since Black has influence around R6.

White should try such invasions only after the big points on top and left side are taken, since such hopeless invasions can also be used as Ko-threats.]
;B[qo];W[qk];B[rn];W[qi];B[qj];W[qg];B[qh];W[rg];B[ri]TR[qd]
C[Psi: Black should protect the cut at R14 by playing at R17.]
(;W[ph]TR[qd]C[Psi: White R16 is bigger (see variation).];B[pi]
TR[qd]C[Psi: Black should prevent White R16 instead.];W[oh]
TR[qd]C[Psi: White should play R16 instead.];B[oi]TR[pi][pj]
[qc]C[Psi: Black makes an unnecessary empty triangle, instead of protecting the top right corner.

Now White R17 can kill the whole top right corner, since R13 stones are no more weak.]
(;W[rh]TR[qc]C[Psi: White 71 is bad. 
Black can ignore such a small move (see variation).];B[rf]TR[qf]
[qe]C[Psi: Black makes another empty triangle instead of protecting the cut.

White R17 does now no more work, but White can next still play R16 .]
;W[pn]TR[qd]C[Psi: White should save the following moves for Ko-fights and cut R16.]
;B[om];W[on];B[ql];W[nn];B[mm];W[mp];B[lp];W[mo]
(;B[no]TR[op][np]C[Psi: Another empty triangle.];W[mn]C[Psi: Compare variation!

- P6 has 7 liberties (one more) after the forcing move of O5. 

- N7 has 3 liberties (one liberty less).];B[lm];W[nm];B[nl]
;W[ol];B[pm];W[pl];B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[po];B[pk];W[rk]C[Psi: White 95 dies in gote.]
;B[ln];W[ro];B[qp];W[sn];B[ok];W[sm]C[Psi: 101 dies in gote.]
;B[lo]C[Psi: M5 now not necessary.];W[hd];B[fm];W[en]TR[fn]
[fo]LB[qd:a][dj:b]C[Psi: White should A or B instead of making an empty triangle and sacrifice F6 since that group does not work and becomes only more heavy.]
;B[em];W[dm];B[do];W[dn]TR[dm][cn]C[Psi: D6 creates the next empty triangle. 
F6 group has become heavy - a welcome target for Black.];B[ck]
C[Psi: Hunting the F6 group is good.];W[dl];B[bl];W[ek];B[dk]
;W[el];B[gl];W[fj];B[di];W[dg];B[cg]TR[fh]LB[fj:a][kh:b][kf:c]
[hf:d][bi:e]C[Psi: Black should hunt F6 group here by playing F12 instead.

Hunting the White F6 group with Black F12 is urgent for multiple reasons.

By hunting White F6
1. Black gets a chance kill the F6 (A) 
2. Black gets a chance to seperate and kill L12 (B) since L12 still has not two eyes yet,
3. Black gets a chance to the save L14 (C).
4. Black will reduce the White moyo (D),
5. Black made territory (E) and will make more];W[hh]C[Psi: White 121 captures Black M15  and connects White F6 and M12.]
;B[hj];W[ih]TR[gi]C[Psi: White should defend at G11 instead.]
(;B[jh]TR[gi]C[Psi: K12 is a mistake (see variation).]
(;W[jg]C[Psi: White is strong enough to ignore K12 and play G11 (see variations).]
;B[ji]C[Psi: Black should sacrifice K12 and play G11 instead.]
;W[gi];B[kg]C[Psi: The following moves to save M15 group are in vain,
since M15 has not enough space to make two eyes and the surrounding stones of White are stronger.]
;W[ig];B[je];W[jc];B[kd];W[jd];B[mi]TR[qc]C[Psi: Black 134 should be at R17,
since it secures top right corner and puts pressure on White R13 group which has still has not two eyes yet.]
;W[li];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki]C[Psi: Mistake.

When you touch an opponents stone, you take away your own liberties and force your opponent to react.
So before touching an opponents stone count your liberties, and imagine your opponents reaction to it.]
;W[jj]C[Psi: When your stones are in atari, it is quite easy to read the following sequences, because there are not many alternatives.
So read the sequence / ladder out before you run away or chase your enemy.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[hi];W[hk];B[ce];W[de];B[cd];W[eh]LB[qd:a][cc:b]
C[Psi: White A and B are bigger.];B[dc];W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[ei]
LB[qc:a][ea:b]C[Psi: A and B are better.];W[df]LB[qd:a][da:b]
[cf:c]C[Psi: A and B are best and sente.

Now White could also create some weakness in Blacks group with C and use blacks weakness depending on blacks defense.]
;B[cf];W[co];B[cp];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[gp];W[bp];B[bq];W[ip]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[jr]C[Psi: Black 166 is gote.];W[kr];B[is];W[in]
C[Psi: This move does not work, because it does not make territory, it does not prevent territory and it does not threaten the opponent.]

;B[mk];W[gk];B[hl];W[kn]C[Psi: White 185 does not work.];B[ik]
C[Psi: This move is gote, because Black will have to play at K9.
There are still bigger points on board elsewhere.];W[gj];B[jk]
;W[fl]
(;B[gm]C[Psi: Psi: Black can tenuki (play elsewhere) here (see variation).]
;W[ie]C[Psi: J15 is not necessary.];B[bn];W[bm]C[Psi: White 193 is gote.]
;B[am];W[cm];B[ap]C[Psi: A4 is now not necessary.];W[cl];B[bj]
;W[si]C[Psi: White 199 is gote - White will have to defend with T12 later.]
;B[sj];W[qi];B[rj];W[sh];B[sl]C[Psi: T8 is not necessary.];W[sr]
;B[so]C[Psi: T5 also not necessary.
Black can calmly play T3 here instead.];W[sq];B[sp];W[qc]C[Psi: White 209 should be at R16.]
;B[qb]C[Psi: Black should play R16 instead and live.];W[qd]
C[Psi: White R16 kills Black.];B[rc];W[ob]C[Psi: White should play S16 instead.
Now Black can live in top right corner.];B[rd]C[Psi: Good...]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[sf];B[se]C[Psi: Mistake...
Black should S15 instead and live.];W[re];B[ea];W[fa];B[da]
;W[fb]
(;B[cc]TR[dc][db]C[Psi: C17 an unnecessary empty triangle (see variation).]
;W[sc]C[Psi: White T17 not necessary.];B[dh]
(;W[eg]TR[dg][df]C[Psi: Instead of making an empty triangle White 227 should be at F11 instead (see variation).]

[in][hn]LB[fi:a][ks:b][jo:c][ho:d]C[Psi: White 231 should be at A or B instead of making two empty triangles.

Also C would be better for White since it leaves the small opportunity to surround J5 if Black fails to play D.]
;B[jl]C[Psi: K8 is not necessary.];W[ks]LB[fi:a][js:b][qh:c]
C[Psi: Black should take A and leave B for White because it means one less Ko-threat for white. 
Afterwards Black could take C and try to win the Ko-fight.]
;B[tt];W[fi];B[tt]TR[oc][od][pd][qe][qf][rf]LB[qd:a][mf:b][jq:c]
[hq:d][pp:e][po:f][fo:g][bh:h]C[White killed Black in the top right corner with A,
because Black made a cutting point and empty triangles that he did not protect.

Black made with B made an unnecessary empty triangle to catch O14 group, which finaly captured B because Black did not save B when it was possible.

White invaded with C Blacks moyo and could steal some points because Black defended with D from the wrong side.

Because White made a bad invasion with C Black became strong with E and could capture F.

White made G heavy instead of sacrificing a single stone after it has lost its function of a ladder braker. So Black could hunt G and make big points around H.
