C[S.

Hello, my name is Simon (7k KGS) and I will be doing the review for you both today.

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask.];B[cp];W[pp]
;B[dc];W[pd];B[nd]C[S.

Right from the outset, black's first move is off. 

The 3-4 stones which black has played are territorial moves where the high approach is an influence oriented move.

It's the fuseki so this isn't going to end the game but it's better to have stones which work together instead of in different directions.]
;W[pf];B[nf]LB[pc:A]C[S.

This move is not the common response, the most common response is at A.

Look it up in josekipedia or eidogo if you want to see the rest of the joseki.

The reason why this move is not played is because it aims to developing too much at once. This move is a purely influential move and since it's so early in the game the area it wants to develop is far too big. White can invade easily and black wont have enough strength to gain much from it in theory.]
;W[ph]C[S.

Good response

Black has some ideas for how to use his stones]
(;B[ql]C[S.

I wouldn't be so quick to play this move, I would rather use the two stones at O16 and O14 first since they are still so open ended...

Also, there's no need for black to invade this early.];W[qn]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[ri]C[S.

Black ends up over concentrated, but it's okay becuase it is an invasion.]
;W[rh];B[oc];W[ce]C[S.

I do not think white should have ignored this. If black plays there again he can make white live very small. That is sad.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[pb];W[qd];B[rc];W[rd]C[S.

See? 9 points for 8 stones, that's no good]
(;B[jc];W[bc]C[S.

This move is missing the point.

Note how black is trying to make a moyo. (Framework)

Why is the corner so important now? Black intents to made a lot of points on the side.

Playing in the corner now means that black will let white have it and build some thickness]

(;B[cc]C[S.

This move isn't the right idea. It doesn't really threaten white's shape at all.

The move I played makes the threat of cutting.

This move does not do that.]
(;W[bb]
(;B[cd]C[S.

Empty triangle, terrible shape];W[bd];B[de];W[cf];B[df]
(;W[cg];B[dg];W[ci];B[nh]C[S.

If white becomes surrounded then that's all the points he will be able to made there. Once again, very sad]
;W[pi]
(;B[qj]C[S.

Bad shape];W[jp];B[pj];W[oi];B[rm];W[rn];B[mp];W[fq]
(;B[eq];W[fp]TR[jp][fq]C[S.

This kick isn't very good, look at the shape it makes,

Extended 3 spaces from 2 stones, this is good for white];B[er]
;W[cm]C[S.

Good move for white, black cannot easily enter C9]
(;B[kq];W[jq]
(;B[kr];W[jr];B[gr];W[nq]C[S.

Good move by white, he's not making a lot of points after G2 so why respond?]
;B[mq]
(;W[jn]C[S.

This move isn't really needed, white's group isn't really under a lot of pressure there]
;B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[ei]
(;W[do]C[S.

Pointless move, whatdoes this do?];B[dk];W[ck];B[bn];W[bm];B[co]

Theres no point in connecting];B[gm];W[ea];B[da]C[S.

Learn the monkey jump!

Look it up in senseis library, also watch the baduk movie over it.

[nr][or]C[S.

The rest of the game is fairly uninteresting so I'll end the review here.

Note that this group isn't alive yet, white should throw in and harass it.

How did white lose this game?

1. He did not reduce blacks points, he grew to become far too big. The main mistake which caused this was the jump into the corner at the start.

2. White never really made a lot of points, the group A got surrounded early on in the game so it couldnt make a lot of points or reduce either.

3. The black group next to C managed to live and reduce white furhter

Upon these revelations I recommend you brush up on your understanding of moyos and life and death. There are books on these so try and see if you can get ahold of them.

Hope you enjoyed the review. Once, again ask me questions if you are unsure. :) Have a nice day!]

Prepare for a huge reduction in black points]))
(;W[jj]TR[ne][ng][eh]C[S.

You really need to focus on reducing black, this might not even be enough

There are a lot of defects around this area, maybe a deep invasion is a good idea for white seeing that he's going to lose if he lets black get too big]

Better]))

Black cannot grow anymore, 

A quick throw in by white at S9 and the black group will be in a lot of trouble]

Once again, I wouldnt ignore 2 stones vs 1 stone]))

(;B[dq]LB[hq:A]C[S.

Aims at the invasion at A];W[hp];B[cm]C[S.

Black makes 15 points, white makes 12 points, not so bad, also black has chances to reduce using N4]

Take care of this, black cannot play here. Do you see why?]

This is a failure for black]))
(;B[de]C[S.

I would play like this to try and salvage the situation, but its not as good as before becuase of C17 instead of C16

Its not terrific though either];W[dd];B[ed];W[cd]C[S.

Try to read out ladders where you can, should black play D15 or E15?]
;B[ee]C[S.

The ladder doesn't work];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[fb];W[db]C[S.

What about the ladder at F16?

Doesn't look like it either, best to play a ladder breaker or to protect the cut]
;B[fg]C[S.

Personally I like this, it protects the cut and increases blacks framework

Too bad it doesnt work, try to read it out];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe]

White is at a complete loss here.]))
(;B[jd]C[S.

Black should rather play high])
(;B[fd]TR[ce]C[S.

Or play a move like this which develops the side

It also puts the marked stone under pressure

Black can gain a lot here if he plays well]))
