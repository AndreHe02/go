C[T: dear reviewer. This was a slow game between me and a german 1d. I felt good in the beginning but it got worse and worste till I lost my advantage. I made some comments at the point what I think were crucial.
I would be were glad if you can comment on them, point out shape-mistakes and espacially bad strategical choices and major endgame mistakes (if there were some).
If you find point where it should be natural, or moves that DAN-players shouldn't even think about, perhaps you can show them.

best
Thomas

;B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd]C[T: this felt like a bad choice

Az: This is bizzare, but I think you need to keep your eye on the LR corner when choosing which side to block on.]
(;B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[qh]TR[qf]C[Az: This is not a very good result, since white will be completely alive in the corner and connected to the outside. The marked stone is very strong, which means that he has lots of freedom to invade or reduce the lower right side.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]LB[pf:A]C[Az: Black 'a' next to try to contain the damage. I revise my earlier comment: this is not "not so good", this is awful for black.]
;B[mc]TR[ob]C[Az: This is pointless. Black has no time to take gote, and the corner is already completely alive so the marked stone isn't important. I realize B may have been trying to build thickness, but this is the wrong direction.]
;W[iq]C[Az: A cautious move, W could extend a little further but he knows he's doing well.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[lp]LB[kq:A]C[Az: Strange, 'a' is the normal plan for extending from the high shimari. If black had sealed up the UR corner so w couldn't get out this might be different.]
;W[fq]LB[io:A]C[T: I was happy when w played f3. I wonder if there have been a better move than m4

Az: See prev comment. White shoud think about defending at 'a' instead since it reduces your moyo while protecting his stone.]
;B[pg]LB[pf:A][oe:B]C[Az: Again, 'a' is the correct shape for containing white. This shape has bad aji six ways to Sunday with moves like W 'b' later.]
;W[qm]C[Az: I don't think W has to play this agressively, this looks like black gets a chance here.]
(;B[qo]C[T: r5 good or better to pincer at r9?

Az: Pincer at r9. This leaves far too much side for a nice extension, after which it'll be difficult to attack white.]
;W[qj];B[pf];W[oj]C[Az: The game is starting to look hopeless for black. Barring act-of-God thickness in the center, there is no effective way to attack the white group, which means that the invasion was a sucess.]
;B[fe];W[dj]LB[di:A]C[Az: If I were W I'd probably play 'a', though this works too.]
(;B[pk]C[Az: This is the wrong place to start here, but it's also the wrong time to attack.]
;W[qk];B[fj];W[dm];B[pj]
(;W[jj]C[Az: White should defend his group first, I think this was a fairly serious mistake. Even still, the center is way too open for black to enclose much terroritory so the game is easy for white.]
;B[jl];W[mj];B[pl];W[qi];B[pi];W[rh];B[rg]C[Az: W has light shape, so black must attack on a large scale to stand much of a chance. B 'a' seems like the only move, contact is bad since you're just giving w more moves locally.]
;W[ri]LB[hk:A]C[Az: W has light shape, so black must attack on a large scale to stand much of a chance. B 'a' seems like the only move, contact is bad since you're just giving w more moves locally.]
;B[kj]C[Az: W has light shape, so black must attack on a large scale to stand much of a chance. B 'a' seems like the only move, contact is bad since you're just giving w more moves locally.]
;W[ki];B[li];W[kk];B[lj];W[jk];B[il];W[lk];B[mi];W[lm];B[io]
LB[kn:A];W[hj];B[gk];W[gi]LB[hh:A];B[eh];W[ig];B[jh];W[fg]C[Az: There is no way black can kill this group. Better to face reality and see if you can get compensation elsewhere.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[ef];W[ih];B[kh];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[ji];W[ii]
;B[gg];W[fh];B[if];W[hf];B[hh];W[ee];B[fd]TR[eh][eg][ef]C[Az: This is a catastrophe, why would black willingly give up the 3 stones on the LHS? I can't understand the meaning of this move at all.]
;W[ei];B[ch];W[df];B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[bl];W[ci];B[cn]
;W[bo];B[dk];W[hd];B[db];W[cc];B[hc];W[ic];B[ib]C[Az: The only problem with this move is that it doesn't work at all. If w had played correct this would have been game ending. Even with w giving back a large portion of the top which he shouldn't have had to give back, there is really no hope for black in yose here, so this is the end of the comments.]
