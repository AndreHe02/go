;B[dp]C[The commentary for this game is requested by slawek 16k, who plays white(W) in this game.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[jq]LB[jp:a]C[If this move had been at 'a', this opening is called the 'san ren sei' opening...]
;W[jo]MA[de][cj]C[This is kind of a move, which may be played in a high handicap game. With such a move, W tries to psycologically embrass B and force him to errors...   But in an equal game, this is a very early play and misses an opportunity to make a corner enclosure.

Possible moves are at the marked points.];B[qj];W[qg]TR[de]
[cj][dj]C[Would be better to play on the left side.

White plays very close here... There are other bigger moves...]
;B[ce];W[de];B[cg]C[At this early stage of the beginning, we can clearly say that B has a big lead...

B has expanded much better.  W will see this great difference and invade. But this opening is clearly much better for B.]
;W[cd];B[be]C[B is playing overconcantrated.
the moves has not come to an end here...]
(;W[cn]LB[cl:a]C[This W move, invites a pincer at 'a'];B[co]
C[If B had played the pincer, W wouls feel the strong pressure.]
;W[dn]LB[ck:a][fq:b]C[A pincer at 'a' is also possible here. W can play a move at 'b' or 'c' in response. But B is very strong and would be happy to welcome a fight in that area.]

;B[oq]C[This move is very strong for B.];W[pn]TR[jo]C[This W move divides the forces of white into 2. W voluntarily buts himself into trouble.. W should have continued playing at the bottom and use the triangle stone to his advantage.

1) Do not allow yourself to be seperated.
2) when playing in a strong opponent area, sacrifice moves generally lead to good results.]

2 very weak stones.];W[oo];B[op]

should be at 'a'];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[pe];W[ne];B[mc]
;W[nc]C[at this let us have a look at the points for W and B.

After W lost in the bottom left and got seperated on the rigth, W has top right, top left and a possible center...

B has left, bottom and right... Quite a lot of points for W to balance.]

In the struggle to catch up, some errors appeared which prepared the loss.

Better opening will lead to much better results...])

(;W[nb];B[ic];W[gc];B[ie];W[pf];B[sg]C[After securing top left and right, W should look for a place to attack B to balance the score..

While attacking he can build a wall for center.

This is possible with a fake invastion at the bottom...   But the mistakes at the right and left, makes it very difficult to catch up. It is only possible with a mistake from B.]

(;W[bd];B[ck];W[jd]C[These are quite important moves for W. W is very balanced, but B has lost 1 important move in the sequence.

Here B will enforce his structure or will invade W formation.   W will be happy to fight if B invades...   If B strengthens his group in one place, there other places for W to invade.

W should no longer wait for an invation.. He should quickly invade.]
