C[tsjanl:

Dear reviewer,

Although this game was quite fast (15 min. + 5 * 30 sec.), I would like ask you to review it, because it shows some essential difficulties I have with the game (in which I was white).

I lost this game, I think, shortly after the opening, because I didn't manage to find a good plan and stick to it. At the end I started to make stupid mistakes out of desperation.

I would appreciate it if you would concentrate on the choosing of plans. You can skip the silly end if you like.

Thanks in advance for your time and willingness to share your insight.

Yes finding a plan out of the opening can be difficult.  I have found that playing with a plan from move 1 helps immensely.  I'll try to show you the thinking process I go through playing in the fuseki.]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[*UH6*
Most people (including me until recently) play this move automatically without really thinking about the choices it makes.

#1 You have chosen influence over territroy. this move doesnt threaten to take the corner. in fact later you are going to want to encourage the opponent to invade around the three three.  

#2 Since you have taken away the option for black to play in in the diagonal oppoing corner, this will be a game where both sides start out with side by side corner moves.  This will likely lead to a game where both player sketch out a large and fairly well coordinated framework then seek to erase/invade the opponent's influence while converting their own into territroy.]
;B[cp];W[pc]C[*UH6*

This move is consistant with the last white move.  Black has played the first two moves of what is known as the Chinese Opening.]
;B[qe]C[black decided to use his sente to attack the low white stone building up his framework at the same time.]
;W[pe];B[qc]
(;W[qb]C[tsjanl: Was R16 better?

*UH6*

the important questions is what plan works best with your stones alredy on the board.

a 3-4 point is very flexible. It threatens to gain territory in the corner and it also can be used to get influence.  Here the few points in the corner are not as important as building influence and cutting these black stones off from the rest of the board.

The variation is how play might take shape if you tried this a little differently.]
;B[qf];W[pf]C[tsjanl: I presume R16 was really needed now.

*UH6* yes r16 would be good.];B[pd];W[od];B[qd];W[oc]C[I doubt there is anything much better . but in this postion white still has cutting points and black has the ability to make a turning hane at Q13. this would be huge as it makes the black group coordinate with the Q4 star point as well as pressuring the white group.]
;B[rb]C[*UH6*
Ok i see why black wants this move. he feels that now he will have eyeshape. still after Q13 eyeshape isnt an issue and if white wants to sped a move to play s17 then black can make many bigger moves all over the board.]

(;W[pa]C[*UH6*
This is a mistake.white should allow black to play q18 here it just stregthens white in sente as shown.

Now black gets sente lets see what he does with it];B[fc]C[*UH6* 
not bad. Further disrupting the coordination of the white stones.

I still think Q13 is better but this is still very good.];W[ic]
C[tsjanl: Is this a good response, regarding the UR?

*UH6* yes this is good. I would have played this way also.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[hb];W[ib];B[eq]C[*UH6*
up to this point White has about 48 points of territroy. to 30 for black.  

Most of the fighting however has taken place where white was strong to begin with.  

White has two solid groups but the groups are not co-ordinated. Black has strong groups in each corner that coordinate fairly well.

this is very advantageous since anywhere white tries to expand he will run into a strong black group before he gets far.]
;W[nq]C[tsjanl: Is this good, or is it better to approach from above?

*UH6* the prverb says approach from the open side
here there is no open side but the side you picked is a little more open so it's fine.]
;B[pn]C[*UH6*
A pincer here would have been great for black. If white is confined to a small corner Black's advantage would be overwhelming. 

Taking territory is good too though so both ideas are probobly valid.]
;W[kq];B[hq];W[dj]TR[dj][hq]C[tsjanl: C10?

*UH6*
I'd say your intuition is corect. The trade of the marked moves has been huge for white.

along the bottom whites stones will prevent black from taking a big territory there. 

however, all the surrounding black stones will prevent white from getting much ther either even if white plays at h3

C10 may be a little tighter territory wise but your move should be good too.  This side star area was a critical point for both sides.]

(;W[fg]C[*UH6* 

it looks like you are starting to drift.
this move does nothing period.
ill show you the plan that comes to my mind here in the variation]
;B[gf];W[pj]TR[pe][pf]C[tsjanl: This seems to be the seed of my loss. Should I have continued chasing the F17-group? Or are there other strategies possible?

*UH6* see the previous variation. You must stop him from plaing the Q13 hane right now because of the marked stones. once you add a couple of moves to these they will be safer but for now you must extend.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[pg]C[*UH6* finally the hammer drops. This group is now an active particiapant in the center, limits the potential of the top right white group, and isolated your two stones on the right side.]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[ph];B[og];W[nf];B[of];W[oe];B[ng]
;W[mf];B[mg]C[*UH6*
look how small your potential in the upper right is now compared to the variation where you prevent black from making Q13.

It now is black who has the potential for territory in the center.]

C[tsjanl: Here I resigned. I assume it is the right moment.

*UH6* 
Yes the resigning tesuji is a very strong move here. :-)

you are at a what was for me a very frustrating moment in my go development.

Now its not good enough for you to make your groups live in gote and play fights ok.

to progress you are going to have to learn about proper direction of play, when its good to get a corner and when its better to let it go, when to sacrifice stones for influence and how....

Don't get discouraged when you lose some games. you may end up losing many as did I trying to figure this stuff out.  

In this game you got behind becuase you didnt judge what was and wasn't important in the position. Your opponent made some mistakes that would have let you get back into it, but you were still sort of looking in the wrong direction trying to attack a living group instead of expanding your territroy, fixing your weaknesses and limiting his potential.  

Work on these things and you will improve greatly. I think you are a good fighter for your rank, so when you start being able to better tell what is and isnt improtant in the positions you will improve quickly.

Don't get discouraged. It can take time to learn to think about go in a different way.

(;W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[qj]C[this idea severely limits the territory black gets on this side and starts expanding your moyo
there is no bigger area on the board right now than the right side.]

(;W[pg];B[pb];W[ob];B[pa];W[oa];B[qa]C[*UH6*
see how much more solid the white shape is now?
and white has sente.];W[qg]C[*UH6*
maybe there are bigger moves but I really like this
 seems very urgent to corral this black group. white has massive influence and thickness now.]

Look at the position here.
Black has 15 points in the corner.  his stones are totally cut off from the rest of the board.the most he can do is crawl along the second line at a and make exaclty one point every time he crawls and you cover.

Can you picture white getting less than 15 points from his thick, well coordinated upper white position?
also note that this white group has great potential to expand and get even bigger and also will strongly influence developments in the center and along both the right and left side.  Black meanwhile has played 8 stones to get exactly 15 points and no other advantages. Very inefficent.]
