C[Hello, Laedis.

First of all, I have cleaned the unrelated comments from your game (and for future reference: you just open the file you sent me with the KGS client, delete them and save again :) ).

I have commented where relevant in view of your question, and also added some overall input on your game. As expected, most emphasis was on your side (the w side), but where appropriate, I have added how your opponent should have played and how you should have responded - go is a game of two, and you cannot play well only by knowing how to play your part :)

Overall impressions and conclusions:

1. Never forget that the point of the beginning phase of the game is to stake out as much of the game board for yourself as possbile, while preventing your opponent from doing the same - therefore, big points before lesser points.
2. The aim of invading your opponents territory is either "hit and run" (i.e. light reduction) or "deploy and survive" (go deep and make a live group) - first is easier to do and preferred, unless you can be sure of surviving or really desperate. The goal is to reduce opponent territory - not to kill him.
3. You can't protect everything - choose what is more important to you and don't simply react to your opponent. Direct confrontation is not always the best defense.
4. Attack while defending and defend while attacking - the better moves are multi-purpose moves, but you need to rememeeber that your opponent tries to do that as well, so always check what _else_ he can be doing except attcking you (e.g. building a wall to protect something)
5. Don't let your opponent go to easy - in this order: invade his big territory when you can, attack weak spots when you can, use his mistakes against him or to strengthen yourself.
6. You have a nice style, and your tactical moves in some spots were very good - just don't stop in mid-way and be more daring :)

Detailed comments are in game. For more question, you can always contact me at angel.stark@gmail.com

Good luck and good gaming!

Regards,
Eddie

;B[dp];W[cd];B[dj];W[ic];B[je]C[Laedis [16k\]: Did I have to respond to this?



Even though it seems like a tricky question, it really isn't - at this point of the game, the b aggression is premature. Both of you are just staking your areas of interest and influence, and b has really nothing to "take" from you, so he basically just wastes that move.

Your answer to this "threat" was too immediate and local, and thus hurt you more than it hurt b. Remember - the best course of action in the beginning is "take the biggest point"! B seems like to threaten your territory, but he can't really cut you and you can gain so much more on other fronts. Check the variations on how to respond to next black move.

Best course was to counter-"attack" - and I put the quotation marks because it would be an attack on a strategic level and not immediate attack. For example - Q10 would be a lovely move: (1) take a big chuck on the right (2) let next b move to show what does he really mean - does he want to try to "cut" you at F16, or maybe at N17, or maybe he just is over-agressive and doesn't know how to continue that (3) make him realise that you aren't frightened by petty agressiveness :)]
(;W[kd];B[ke]C[This is b mistake, stemming from same point as yours reaction - rememeber that at this stage of game big points are much more important.

However, as it stands, black managed to wall you off the center a bit. If we think a bit more abstract about it, he claimed all the board under line 25, while it seems that you only claimed the top - and unfortunately it's not protected enough to be worth it. Check variations for posible black invasions.]
(;W[nq]C[This is the right notion, but missed direction - playing to protect at the top more would be a bad mistake, but O3 would be much better placed at Q10 (to claim more area) or K4 (to make your threat more intimidating).]
;B[np];W[mp];B[mq]C[Laedis [16k\]: I should've played at m3



Mmmm... Yes and no. It's not that M4 was a bad move in itself (though it does make your life difficult, if you have a nasty opponent :) ), but rather is that you lost sight of what an invasion / close attack is meant to do and to achieve.

Think of dropping a commando team into an enemy territories or making a raid - the primary objective is "hit and run", i.e. make a plan, go in, make max damage and go out alive. In case the enemy is sluggish in defending, you carve a safe base (as big as you safely can) and stay there, annoying the enemy while you fight him on another front).

When you take this analogy back to the go board it translates to the following strategy: when you invade - make a plan of what you intend, so you can play to that end, but once you're in, keep attacking until you can no longer threaten the opponent, and then either escape to the center or towards your forces, trying to stay connected and walling the opponent in, or build a live group, with potential to threaten the opponent from behind in the future.

In this regard, M4 was pulling too soon, while you still have potential of attacking, as seen in move like M3, made worse by playing P3 - this move is attacking in the wrong direction without backup.]
(;W[lp];B[nr]C[By the way, b would be better to play M3 before this move, to make himself safer.]
(;W[oq]C[This is a move, as I said that cannot hope to accomplish anything - surrounded without backup. Would be better in variation.]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[op];W[or];B[pr];W[lr];B[os];W[ms];B[pq];W[qj]
C[This is a good move BUT you have not yet made your bottom group safe! If b plays at J3 next - all your effort and sacrifice at the bottom are wasted.]
(;B[oi]C[And b clearly missed that... :)]
(;W[pi]C[No need to come into contact so soon. You have two options here - to connect back lighter with R13 or contonue exanding with R7]
;B[og];W[pg];B[ph]C[That's why unnecesary contact play is not good - it gets messy real fast...]
;W[qh];B[oh];W[hp]C[Laedis [16k\]: Maybe one lower?



Maybe to be safer, not it's OK as it is - see variations.]
(;B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq]
(;B[io]C[This is a VERY bad move...];W[gq]C[Good! Consistent with making base and protecting the cut]
;B[ho];W[go];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[do];W[cq]C[Laedis [16k\]: Can this live and if so, how?



Even if it can live, this is the wrong direction of play - you have done enough damage for b at the bottom, now is the time to make more territory for yourself while attacking b on other fronts. Maybe with C12 or R7.

Moreover, if you see now, you are pretty much walled off from the center (the thing that cost you the game). Better break b hold there someway - maybe with M6 or P7, which can be linked easily.

Pay attention - invasions are not for making territory (you haven't made much on the bottom, even though you ended it well - up till this moment, at least - but b lost a huge amount from his perspective).]
;B[dq]
(;W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[eq]C[This is a mistake if you want to cut b, but ended well by making sure your group alive there. Overall - I would be careful with such moves :)]
;B[cr];W[fr];B[ds];W[ep];B[en]
(;W[ed]C[This is too slow. True b can invade there, but you can live wasily (see variations). Better would be to "attack here" with C13 or C12.]

C[Didn't comment each move, but this is the overall:

This sequence up till now was not bad - especially the R7 play, which pushed b back nicely, but you need to remember two points:

1. Better to make big moves if there is nothing really urgent.
2. And if you pay attention, while you  are protecting yourself, b build a very impressive wall. You have to remember that you can't let him have such big advantage, and as soon as posible make a move somewhere near F14 in order to break into the center.]
;B[nd]C[This is a mistake and a wasted move, which you could have used to break free and play somewhere else. B already broke into top with this chase, but you don't lose much there - he destroys yours, you destry his (i.e. go into the center :) )]
;W[of]C[This attempt to cut was toop ambitious - there is nothing for you to support it (no your stones and no open space to run into), while lots of b stones to support b defense.]
;B[nf];W[nc];B[mc];W[mb];B[kc];W[lc];B[md]
(;W[kb];B[gd]C[And b uses the opening which you should have - instead of pushing him to the middle, he pushes you to the top while protecting his center]
;W[gc]C[Best possible defense - nice :)];B[fd];W[fc];B[ee];W[dc]
C[Puts no pressure on b - D16 is better and safer for later play at B15.]
;B[id]C[This move destroys your potential to invade the center from the top. The only possibility is to invade with M6 but this is easily defended agaisnt, though makes the game close. Also must not forget the potential of w at S4.]
