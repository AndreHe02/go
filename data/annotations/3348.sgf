C[buckyyowza: Hello.  Comments by Mark Fyffe, all prefixed with "buckyyowza:".  I hope you find my comments to be of use.  Since this game is focused on strategy and influence, rather than hand-to-hand tactical fighting, I will try to focus my comments on how black could better read the whole board situation and play in an area that is more to his advantage.

Dear Reviewer,
I am stuck for a few months now on 5-6K, and I would like to understand my mistakes in order to make progress.
This is a typical game of mine (I play Black), where in the beginning of the game I lead - but then waste my advantage and I finally lose.
Could you help me to understand what I did wrong?
Thanks!];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[lp];W[pn];B[np]

(;B[op]LB[oq:A]C[buckyyowza: I think normally this play would be at P3, so that white is smaller and then black will get sente more easily.]

(;B[nm]LB[cf:B][ql:A]TR[pn]C[buckyyowza: black's position is good, but O7 is not the right direction.  White's stone is dangerous aji to the R5 group because that group is not settled well.  Also, black is very thick already, so I would rather play at R8 to eliminate white's aji there, or to use the thickness to begin play in another part of the board, such as at C14.  By contrast, O7 is a little slow and almost invites white to make trouble for the right side... when opening with san ren sei you will want to keep that side safe.

Seems to me black looks OK at this point;
Is O7 the right point to play?];W[pg];B[qh]LB[nd:B][qg:A]C[buckyyowza: this lower shoulder hit is almost always a bad idea.  imagine now a white stone at R13, then white easily invades this moyo with no compensation for black.  I would prefer now to play the joseki move at O16.  This will give white a difficult time escaping the Q13 stone, which is also too high to settle easily.]
;W[od];B[pc]LB[qg:A]C[buckyyowza: R13 is biggest now because the right side is bigger than the corner.  white is not thick enough to worry about, and the P16 tsuke is not a very effective corner approach.]

[cf][dn][co][do]C[buckyyowza: now white is getting thickness, and black's right side is much less than it should be for your fuseki.  it is now urgent to begin an approach along the left side or upper left to counter this development.  obvious choices are C14, C5, and F17 although a high approach (D6 or D5) on the lower left also seems playable.]
;B[nc]LB[ld:A][co:B]C[buckyyowza: although big, this does not force the capture of P15 so it is gote.  White can play at M16 or shimari at C5 to further develop his shape.]

buckyyowza: if white plays at O8, black is in a lot of trouble.  the best shape is for black to play at N8.  It looks to me that white's stones will either live or white will be compensated for them (with a huge center moyo).  After black N9, white's escape will be gote and black can proceed with developing on the left side, where the game is more likely to be decided.  To stop this sort of thing, play R8 earlier (e.g. at b19 or b45) ;-)]

buckyyowza: yes, it is best to leave it alone for now because there is no thickness to help these stones with.  black's upper side is enough to compensate if these stones are killed entirely, but trying to escape them without any means to do so will cost a lot of points.]

buckyyowza: M3 seems better than H16 because after H16 white will put pressure on your center group (which still only has one eye).  Otherwise, they seem about the same.  I would like to play at C14 because it is the biggest part of the board right now.]

Now both players have focused almost entirely on the right side.  White has been quite successful at some incursions into black's sphere, and has close off much of black's influence in his own sphere.  Black is especially thin in the upper left.  At this point, I would rather be white ;-)]

C[There must be bigger points than P10 for Black...
Seems to me a slack move; But it sente, so?

buckyyowza: actually P10 is gote as it only saves 6 points and threatens to take 3.  Right now, it would be best to make a big jump from the D14 stone, at C10 or C11.  It does not matter then if white takes your eye, if there is a big group to run to... the proverb says "it is better to run than live" :-)]

buckyowza: G8 is suicide; white follows with E5, but even if white F5 black cannot live (see var).  E7 is bad shape, normally black would get caught in a squeeze tesuji after that play, but here black would be lucky (see var).  black should play at F5 to live simply]

Please indicate if you can tell me about it;
But looking again at the beginning of the game, seems to me Black wasted his advantage.

What do you say?

Thanks!

buckyyowza: The rest of the game is pretty clean, so this is a good stopping point.  This game is quite close now, and it ends with a close margin.  Actually, I think that white opened stronger, but then wasted the advantage :-)  This is because all of the early fighting was successful for white, as his invasions in black's sphere all lived without sacrificing influence in his own sphere.

However, I think that early on black did a good job of fighting white down, but never took advantage of white's passive play in the middle game to attack on the left side.   black especially had a lot of opportunity to attack in white's upper left and lower left corners, but never quite made it in time.

In all a very good game!  Thank you for the opportunity to look this over, I hope my comments can help you to get stronger.  If you have any questions about this game, please feel free to contact me by email or look for 'bucky' on IGS and KGS.]
