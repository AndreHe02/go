C[Hello, my name is Holger,
I will be reviewing your game. I hope you will find my comments and suggestions useful.

After reviewing the game I have following suggestions to improve your play. Try to look at the whole board and identify your groups which are in danger. Also look for regions on the board where you can still gain influence. White often tried to surround black groups, which already had escaped. This lead to a weak position for white and in the end a large white group was lost. 
There were also a few moves which were too small considering the rest of the board. Black did not need to respond and you lost sente.]
;B[qf]C[I didn't know how to deal with this starting move. Should I have taken the chance to put on the hoshi at Q16?

H: This is a strange move by black. White can ignore and take the other corners first. The bad position of the black stone will give white an advantage later on in the game.]
;W[dd];B[qp]C[wenzi [18k?\]: hope we have a good game together]
;W[cp]C[vehikkeli [?\]: yeah!   :)];B[ep]
(;W[do]C[H: This is not joseki, see alternative]
(;B[dj]C[Should I have taken K4 hoshi instead of engaging in a fight so early in the game?

H: This is a mistake. Black should respond to D5];W[gp]C[H: No problem with starting a fight when the opponent makes a mistake.]
;B[eo];W[en]
(;B[dn]C[H: Black is trying to cut the white stones but the black stones are weak. Black should try to secure his stones first. See alternative]

;W[bp];B[fq];W[fr];B[er];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr]C[H: Well done by white, the black corner dies.]
;B[iq]TR[oq]C[H: This is too close to white's sphere of influence. Maybe black at P3 to secure the lower right corner.]

(;W[ho]C[Would things be different if i put at J3? Might have gotten more territory space

H: White at J4 is a good response. See the alternative.];B[lp]
C[H: Now black can build territory in peace]
(;W[hm]C[H: unneccesary, the black stone at G5 is not important. You loose sente for only  a few points.
Why not play the hoshi at Q16 now?];B[df]
(;W[jd]C[H: White should respond to black D14.];B[gd]C[H: not good for white]

(;W[gc]C[Quite unsure of this move. Should I have pressured above instad of linking below the black stone?

H: As you see later, this does not link the white stones. Try to strengthen the corner]

(;W[bl]C[Was trying to save the little bit of territory I had.. Should I have tried to get the outer influence?

H: There is still enough space on the board to make new territory. Why not exploit the weakness in the top right corner?]

Your first priority should be to save the white stones around G14. Play somewhere around the marked positions to escape]
