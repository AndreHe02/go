C[leary [13k\]: hi
gogamer [17k\]: please teach me :)


hi gogamer,
i just heared that this game is sent to another reviewer
i will review it anyhow, so you get 2 different opinions];B[dp]
C[leary [13k\]: i hope i can do];W[pd]C[gogamer [17k\]: you can, i am not really good]
;B[cd]C[leary [13k\]: me neither :)];W[pp]C[gogamer [17k\]: but you are 13 kyu :)]
;B[cj]LB[ec:A]C[a little bit low and one side, but this also a matter of taste
A is a solid move that give you solid points];W[cn]LB[ec:A]
C[there is no need for an invasion yet
A is a lot better]
(;B[fp]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[this move is not good
white is trying to get a base along the side to make an living group
now he can make a base in the corner

if white plays like this and you have a stone at A or B you should play C without hesitation

see variation];W[bp];B[cq];W[bk];B[bj];W[eo];B[do];W[dn];B[fo]
;W[fn];B[jp]C[good move makes you group stable];W[ed]C[the variation is better i think
this way you keep you stones connected]
(;B[ec];W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[bd];W[fd];B[de]C[- maybe c-14 is better? i intended to cut using a ladder braker later but  this position maks my stone on the left look really weak...


i think you are right];W[df];B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[no]
(;B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[cf]C[white is cutting of your marked stones]

(;B[qj]
(;W[qm]
(;B[qg]LB[qf:A]C[a little bit small A is better];W[nd];B[jc]
;W[fc];B[mc]C[brave move
your left corner group is getting in danger];W[nc];B[md];W[eb]
;B[db];W[fb];B[cb]LB[bb:A]C[it is good to protect your group
A is better shape];W[be];B[ad]LB[bc:A]C[A is safer];W[ej]C[good move by white]
;B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[eh];B[re];W[qc];B[rl];W[rm];B[jf]C[it is good to make your group solid]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[pf];B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[mf];W[nh]C[at 70 ask if black can escape
i don't think so]
(;B[oi];W[ck]C[- would i have a chance of escaping if white hadnt played there?

but this way white is safe];B[gf]C[-here come the ladder breaker]
;W[he]C[71 is not a ladder breaker
see var];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef]C[white should play b]
(;W[eg]SL[eh][ei][ej];B[ff];W[dg];B[ie]LB[hf:A]C[you should play A your stone can still be caught]
;W[ib]LB[hf:A]C[if white plays A he will catch your stones]
;B[ge]LB[hf:A][gn:B][lm:C]C[A is still better
after that white has to defend his group and you can expand your territory at B or C]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[hf];W[jb]C[see var]
(;B[ic];W[kc];B[kd];W[lb];B[lc]C[if you played at "a" your self 
whie is cut and in the endgame youcan jump in the cornere];W[mb]
;B[kb];W[ka];B[hb];W[gc]C[nog good for white];B[ia];W[kc];B[nn]
;W[ja];B[kb];W[ha];B[mm]C[strong move
you are strong in the center
white will not make points there];W[on];B[oo];W[op];B[po];W[qo]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[om];W[pm];B[on];W[oq];B[nr];W[or];B[pl]C[it is better to play A
youexpand your territory and make it impssible for white to invade]
;W[jq]C[just play calm "b"
ther is little space four white eyes]

;W[od];B[qe];W[rd];B[qd];W[rc];B[gk]LB[gj:A]C[- was there a better pleace to invade whits potential territory in the center?

ther is no potential territory in the center yet
because of blacks wall
157 is little deep perhaps A is better];W[hh];B[hk]LB[il:B]
[hm:A];W[il]C[leary [13k\]: thx];B[ik];W[jl]C[if you can connectyou black stones

;W[ir];B[jq];W[mj];B[ga]C[leary [13k\]: i think its worth it

-was it really worth it?

this ko is big
if white can get your center stones
he has a lot of points in the center
you will lose then

183 is not big enough];W[mi];B[ia];W[kc];B[fa];W[ha];B[ea];W[lk]

leary [13k\]: nice one
gogamer [17k\]: you are still leading though
leary [13k\]: i dont think so
leary [13k\]: well
leary [13k\]: maybe
gogamer [17k\]: if i beat a 13 kyu i am haveing a party tonight :)

6 points lower left
25 points in the center
