C[pajaro:
Hi. In this game, I was playing black against an opponet 3 stones
stronger. I didn't expect to win, so I played quite unworried, but in
the end it was just a 5.5 points defeat. How could I have won? thanks]

(;B[dp]C[pajaro:
As there was a free corner, I took the chance to go there, althoug not
finishing the joseki.

Frank: This is a possibility. You must however take in account that white can "punish" you for net finishing the joseki. See variation.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jd]C[pajaro: I ususally play this joseki in this situation. What else could I have done?

Frank: you could have played other joseki's to. You just have to keep in mind that white has the reducing of the upper right corner as a possibility (see variation before)]
;B[nc]LB[oc:a]C[Frank: Very good ! This takes away the possibility of a white move at a (P17) and reduces the white potential at the uppeside.]
;W[pj];B[dj];W[fq];B[iq];W[cn]C[pajaro: Double pincer... I think I should attach, but...]
;B[co]LB[eo:a][fp:b][dn:c]C[Frank: Not this way, indeed.  You make white stronger and the corner still isn't yours. a (E5), b (F4) or c (D6) are better options. Since you played a pincer a J3, you should be willing to give up the corner in exchange for profit on the left or the under side.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[eq];B[ep];W[cr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[ck];B[cj]
C[pajaro: I think I am better. I have thickness, and he has an isolated group and a weak one. Am I right?

Frank: You are thick in the upper left side, but I shouldn't call your group left under thick. But you're right that white has two weak groups to look after, which should give you attacking possibilities.]
;W[dk]
(;B[bo]C[Frank: white can't connect here. Better E10 to keep the white group in the middle-left running. If you want to attack the lower white group, better at C2. See variation.]
;W[bq]C[Frank: white could tenuki.];B[fj];W[fl];B[hj]LB[hk:a]
[hl:b]C[pajaro:
I wanted to attack on a grand scale. But perhaps it makes it too easy
for white to escape.

Frank: the least you could have played is a (H9). A capping move at b (H8) is another option. The white group can escape in the center but isn't alive yet, so can be attacked for another while which should give you the opportunity to profit elsewhere.]
;W[ek];B[ej]LB[gk:a][hl:b]C[Frank: Too obedient. Why not a (G9 ) or even b (H8). White won't have an easy time if he tries to cut. Remember, you're the one who is strong here.]
;W[hl];B[jk];W[go];B[gp];W[bn];B[hr]C[pajaro:
Although my group is strong, I didn't want white to counterattack, so I
played this exchange. Nothing to worry?

Frank: You don't have to worry about a counterattack at the moment. It should be better to encircle the white group further, even if it's probably alive yet. E.g.  K6. Another possibility is to play a kakari at O3.]
;W[fr];B[jo]C[Frank: Good];W[in];B[kn]C[Frank: nothing wrong with K6]
;W[nq];B[pm]C[Frank: I would prefer R6 or R4 to see how white reacts.  If you look at the board now we can see that you have two big corners and a lot of strength in the middle an lower side. You should use this strength at best to reduce whites big moyo at the right side.]
;W[qn];B[qk]C[Frank: Better R7. Makes your invading stones stronger and gives more aji in the white corner.]
;W[qm]C[Frank: this hurts];B[pl];W[qj]C[Frank: this too];B[rk]
C[Frank: you only succeeded in separating white, which you could have done with a move at R7]
;W[lq];B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[ke];B[md]C[Frank: Better L18];W[jb]
;B[le]C[Frank: Again better L18. You won't make many points in the center, neither will white.]

Well, that's the game. I ended with one group, and white has 5. All of
them alive! Maybe I could have done some better in the endgame, but
that's all. What do you think?

Frank: You clearly lost in the endgame. The remarks I made during the endgame are just the bigger mistakes.  You started well and handled whites invasion left under good. Your invasion at the right side was not that good, but even then you were still ahead.]
