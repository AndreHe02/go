C[Hi.  I hope you find this review helpful.  I've tried to answer your specific questions as well as point out things I noticed about your play.  If you find any parts of the review unclear, don't hesitate to email me: ben.orenstein@gmail.com]

[ck:A][dk:B][bp:D]C[fischer973 [11k\]: here i hesitated
fischer973 [11k\]: i look at this 4 moves, what is the best, and what could be black answer

There is no "best", really.  This is go!  The choices you've highlighted each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

A creates a settled group quickly, but doesn't try to claim much territory.  It's a good move when black has more stones than weight in an area.

B is similar, but creates more influence toward the center at the cost of territory.  This move might be be best when white is ahead in territory, but expects fighting in the center.

C is more ambitious about claming territory, but leaves a weakness behind where black can invade.  This move is best when white is strong in an area, or is confident about his ability to handle both his groups if cut apart.

D also settles quickly, at the cost of taking away white's ability to invade the 3-3 (if black responds at C3, as is standard).

Each of these options have strengths and weaknesses.  None could really be said to be 'best' this early in the game.  However, I would generally avoid C when black makes the low extension like this.  Black's corner group is relatively solid, and a 3-space extension invites the invasion that you saw in te game.]

Yes, A would be good here.  It's important to kill the black stone and make yourself one group here.]

(;W[cq]C[fischer973 [11k\]: bad move, i think
fischer973 [11k\]: it fragilize my stones

Correct, this is bad.  W can live here, but it strengthens black's group.  This is undesireable because W's group above it is so weak.]

(;W[lr]C[Bad.  This move is very passive.  Black is not threatening to do anything very bad to you.  See vars for larger moves (all are better than responding)]
;B[kq];W[lp]C[Also small.  You should try to break this habit of responding so readily.  Ask yourself how much damage black can do if you tenuki (ignore) his move.  Seek a larger move elsewhere.]

At this point he's probably right not to answer: I'd be surprised if he could make these stones live.  This is of, course, a VERY large swing in your favor.]

fischer973 [11k\]: perhaps the best(and simple) is to connect at A? what do you think of it

The weakness at A is imagined :)  

I would simply play as in the variation.  You are quite a bit ahead and so can play very conservatively and simply.]

Not necessary.  See var.];B[de]
(;W[ed];B[ee]C[fischer973 [11k\]: bad choice in reality, ....:s]
;W[ff];B[fd];W[ge];B[id]C[Summary:

1.  Don't be so happy to answer your opponent's moves.  Try to tenuki (play elsewhere and ignore) often!

2. The area in front of a shimari (corner enclosure) is quite valuable.  Try to extend in front of the direction your shimari 'faces'.

Let me know if you have any questions.
