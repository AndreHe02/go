C[I played white, my opponent played black - No handicap, and komi was 0.5. (Not sure why, since my opponent is 12K, but those were the settings s/he requested). It was 30 minutes main time plus 5 periods byo-yomi, 20 seconds each.]

C[Here I decide to let black take the corner, since I didn't want to get shut in.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[rq];W[rp];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr]
C[I feel like this is a good outcome for white..?

What white have gained is allot of influence towards the center while black is confined to the corner. White now has to make use of the influence to gain terretory or it will be a waste of stones.]
;B[qs];W[mo]C[This now seems a timid extension...maybe I should have played N8 or something simliar?

You are right. This extension should be much wider. There are allot of white stones to lean against so the extension should be big. Sometimes a good way of to extend terretory is by attacking your opponents stones. N8 is better then N5 but maybe Q8 is ever better. Q10 migth also work. Blacks stone R9 is weak so if white attacks it white can build a wall against it. This will obvioubly make R9-R13 a stronger group so one must figure out who will gain the most from an attack.]
;B[hq];W[jq];B[gm]C[Here black gained allot of potential terretory in his last two moves. Since N5 was so weak and not thretening anything black cloud decide how to rule the game. N5 was in gote.]
;W[rl]C[Threatening a monkey jump...

What was the purpose of the move? S8 will make black respond with S9. This is quite certain. So when you place S8 you have to think if things are better after the negotiation S8, S9 or not. If not it's not a good move.]
;B[rk];W[pl]C[Avoiding an empty triangle...];B[oi];W[ml]C[Making a moyo, which is perhaps not ambitious enough. Should I have extended further?

Maybe w Q9, bQ10, wO9. I don't know. I would propobly have tried wJ4, bH4, wJ5...  instead.]
;B[nf];W[me];B[kf];W[mf];B[mg];W[ne];B[of];W[oe];B[lf];W[pf]
;B[pg];W[qf];B[lj];W[lb]C[C8 is weak. That could be usefull. When you place M18 it is again quite certain what black will respond with. In this case black will be happy to place a stone at L18. This strengthens his influence around L17-F17.]
;B[kb];W[lc];B[gf]C[Black gets lots of terretory.];W[gi];B[ih]
;W[hk]C[Threatening to link up my two groups.

Why should black feel threatend by that? Both your and his groups are quite strong so linking up the groups makes no difference.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[kn];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[mj];B[li];W[mi]
;B[mh];W[pj]C[Trying to cut off the two black stones at R9, but not expecting to be successfull.]
;B[kk];W[ln]C[Defending.];B[ni];W[qj]C[Surprised to foind myself able to cut off these stones.]
;B[mk];W[nk]C[Atari blindness here, I should have connected.]
;B[nj];W[nl];B[ll];W[lm];B[km];W[rj];B[oj];W[sg]C[Linking my two groups.

I see no reason for this. You only have to link groups if they are threathend to be killed. C8 is still weak.]
;B[ri];W[si];B[rh];W[sh];B[rf];W[sf]C[I should have played S 13, but I'm not sure how big a mistake this was.

Yes S13 is a better move.];B[rg];W[ir];B[rd]C[Here comes black's invasion - can it be killed? There is not much space here, but I couldn't see a way to kill it. I managed to make it live very small though. I was pleased with this outcome - could I have done better?

Yes, you should have killed it. You have to make sure two things happen. Give black no room for two eyes. And make sure you can connect your white stones (make sure they cannot be eaten.)]
;W[qd]C[This is good.];B[rc];W[qc]C[Also good.];B[qb];W[pb]
C[Good.];B[ra];W[sd]C[Bad. This is where you fail. If you place at T18 instead black will have no space to make eyes.]
;B[sb]C[Now black gets to place at T18 and will live.];W[se]
;B[sc]C[Black lives small.];W[le];B[ke];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ef]
;W[dg];B[ok];W[pk];B[ol];W[om];B[fk];W[bk]C[Black ignores this threat...

Black should have played B8 here. And that would be bad for white. White should have played B8 instead.]
;B[dk];W[an]C[...so I make good on it.];B[bp];W[cn];B[dn];W[cm]
;B[bl];W[al];B[ak]C[Strange move...I waited to see if my opponent wanted to undo, but s/he didn't.]
;W[aj];B[ao];W[dl];B[bn];W[bm]C[A7 is better here. Now you loose A6.]
;B[am];W[el];B[fl];W[dj]C[Why not E9? Now black can connect.]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[em]C[This is a bad move by black. White does not need to answer until black places another stone at D7. In other words black E7 is in gote. White should stop here and think if there is a better move. A move that will gain white more then protecting 1-2 points. F1 is one move that you should have seen.]
;W[dm];B[fn];W[an]C[Again... F7 is worth much more then this move.]
;B[hr];W[bo];B[cp];W[ap];B[bq];W[aq];B[ar];W[ao]C[Seems like I've made some gains here on the edge.]

;B[if];W[hj]C[My aim here is to reduce black's middle.];B[ii]
;W[gj]C[G9 is a bit better.];B[ik];W[ij];B[jj];W[il];B[jk];W[hl]
C[H7 is better.];B[im];W[hm];B[hn]C[I feel please with this incursion into the middle.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[de];B[eh];W[ei];B[dh];W[ch];B[ee];W[cd];B[ec]
;W[ca];B[db];W[da];B[ba]C[Another strange self-atari from black.

Yes.];W[aa];B[ea];W[ba];B[pi];W[qi]C[Is this whites best move? Remember to review the whole board. Not, just look where blacks last move was.]
;B[qh]C[This is a bad move.];W[ld]C[Why not L16? But ever worse why not P13?! 
O14 and P14 are yours to take.];B[og]C[To late. Black found his error.]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[gl]C[This move does not gain much points. There are better moves.]
;B[fm];W[is];B[hs];W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[pq];W[sq];B[sr];W[sp]
;B[rr];W[ej]C[If you are playing by japanese rules this is a 0-point move. You are placing stones in no mans land, gaining nothing.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[on];W[np]C[This is a bad mistake, I should have played O6.

Yes.];B[nm];W[pm];B[mm];W[nn];B[mn];W[pn];B[lo];W[lp];B[ln]
C[I think I lost quite a bit here form this mistake.];W[co]
;B[ep];W[pa];B[qa];W[fj];B[qe];W[pe];B[sj]C[A few pointless moves from black here.]

It is hard to estimate the score. A good way to do it is by comparing potential terretories visually to eachother. Reducing white and black terretories of the same size and se what is left.]
