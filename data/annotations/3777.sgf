C[This is a review done by Shaydwyrm for Bazzone through the Go Teaching Ladder on October 25, 2004.

Summary of the main points:

- Your opening was ok, you were leading for much of the game.  A few shape issues, but nothing deadly.  Your instincts seem to be serving you well, so resist the temptation to study joseki for now.

- Knowing good shape would go a long way for you, as well as careful reading.  There were some deadly misreads near the end of the game, I assume as your time began to run low.  Lots of life and death problems will solve this problem - get a book if you can.  1001 Life and Death Problems is good if you have the patience for it.

- Being able to attack effectively is a difficult skill to learn.  If you get a chance you should take a look at Attack & Defence by Ishida & Davies.  Kato's Attack & Kill is another book that helped me a lot, although the problems are very difficult.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj]LB[ec:A][ed:B]C[A san-ren-sei is almost never bad.  Approaching at A or B is another very good option.]
;W[dj]C[This is an odd move, inconsistent with the two 3-4 points played already.  You cannot punish it immediately though - just play as normal and look for chances to make it look out of place.  This move is not worth 100% of a move.]
;B[ec]C[Good.  White is making a moyo on the left, so you limit its size and prevent a shimari.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee]
(;B[jd]C[It is too soon to leave your stones in the top left, they are still thin.  See the variations.]
;W[dc]C[This gives white very strong shape, it is not a good idea to allow this.  It is for this reason that K16 is usually played at D17.]

(;B[eb]C[Now you want to defend here somehow, but this is a very small move, and gives white sente.  See the variations.]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[Good - you are high and have a strong presence in this part of the board, so pincer and make white take the corner or fight.]
;W[jq];B[np]C[Again good - you look to complete a strong outside wall here.]
;W[oq]
(;B[pq]C[This is too much - you cannot kill white here, you are too thin.  Better to stay on the outside as in the variation.]
;W[op];B[oo];W[mp];B[no];W[mq]C[Compare with the variation and you can clearly see the difference.]
;B[co]TR[gf][ln]C[This may be a little deep right now, since white has gotten strong at the bottom and has D10.  Approaching high might make for an easier escape, or you can play the moyo game at one of the marked points.]
;W[cm];B[eo];W[cp]
(;B[fq]C[This shape seems a little thin, so this may be overplay.  See the variation.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[dp];B[cn];W[dm];B[en];W[er]C[White is too scared for his corner here.]
;B[fr];W[bo];B[ip]C[Good - B5 was a nothing move.];W[jp]
(;B[iq]C[This is bad shape, since it allows white to hane at the head of your stones.]
;W[lp]C[White lets you off the hook.  Lucky.]
(;B[kr]C[You can't save this stone, but you can profit by threatening to pull it out.  See the variation.]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[jr];B[ir]C[This is an endgame move, white can ignore at this point and still keep an eye at the bottom, while getting a free move elsewhere.  F15 looks big, or R17.  This is too small.]
;W[js]
(;B[jn]C[This is the wrong direction.  You are forcing white to create strength facing your moyo - your big territory will be on the right and on top, not here at the bottom.  See the variation.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[kn];B[jm];W[km];B[jl];W[mo]C[White lets you off the hook again.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[kl];B[kj]C[This looks a little thin, I would be worried about a white play at K9 (hane at the head of three stones), followed by a cut at J6 or something.  It may not be possible now, but it is very bad aji.  One space to the left is better shape.]
;W[pr]C[You can ignore this...];B[qr];W[or]C[...but ok, you got sente anyway.]
;B[fe]C[Good, this is a big point.  You are definitely winning at this point.]
;W[bn]C[Another small move.];B[ef];W[df]
(;B[eg]C[This is slack.  See the variations.];W[dg];B[eh];W[dh]
C[Now you have given white 4th line territory.];B[fj];W[ej]
;B[fk];W[ek];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[bl]
(;B[ml]C[This move doesn't do enough, it leaves a huge hole in your position.  See the variations.]
;W[lk]C[Now you cannot just let white plow into your sphere, you must cut him off and make him fight for it.]

(;B[mk];W[lj];B[kk];W[ll];B[ni]C[Now it is too late.];W[po]
C[This is a weakness left behind a long time ago, back when you played at Q3 instead of P4.  You should be able to come out of this ok though.  The first thing to remember is consider not playing atari on the cutting stone.  Unless you can capture it, atari is often not a good plan.]

(;B[pn];W[qo];B[qp]C[Now you are in trouble.  This is better one space to the right, but it is still trouble.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[rq]C[You can't live in the corner any more.  Better to play at R8 and cut your losses.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[rn];B[so];W[ro];B[ql];W[rl];B[sn]C[Misread, I guess.]
;W[sm];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[rs];B[li];W[mj];B[nj];W[mi];B[mh]
;W[ri];B[sj];W[qg];B[rf];W[qi];B[qj];W[qf];B[qe];W[rg];B[sf]
;W[sg];B[re];W[og]
(;B[ph]C[At this point it is more important to cut white off from the outside, then look for a vital point.  He doesn't have space for two eyes right now, so he will have to find another on the outside.]
;W[pg];B[qh];W[pi];B[oh];W[rh];B[lh];W[ng];B[nh];W[me]
(;B[mf]C[Here you are cutting dead stones from dead stones.  Just kill the whole thing - cutting will leave your stones with weaknesses to exploit.  See the variation.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[oe];B[nd];W[mg];B[lf];W[le];B[lg];W[od];B[oc]
;W[nc];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[ke];B[kd];W[pc];B[ob]C[Your weak cutting stones gave white all these forcing moves, and now he looks like he's alive.  Plus, if you're not careful, your own stones in the top right may die.]
;W[pb];B[pe];W[of];B[la];W[nb]
(;B[rb]C[Too thin.  R17 would let you live with territory since you can force at R18.  See the variations.]
;W[qc];B[rc]C[I think you are still ok here, white should have played S17 instead of R17.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[ma];B[ka];W[oa];B[lc];W[mb];B[pa]C[Not good - allowing white to play R19 is troublesome.]
;W[qa]
(;B[qb]LB[ob:1][sh:2]TR[na]C[This move does nothing, white is alive with an eye at the triangle and half eyes at 1 and 2.]
;W[rd]C[Now you are dead.];B[sd];W[qd];B[ra];W[pf];B[pa];W[se]
;B[db]C[Now that white has taken the entire right half of the board, I'm afraid it's time to resign.]

;B[ae];W[be];B[ad];W[bd];B[ac];W[bc];B[ab];W[bb];B[ag]C[White's lead is down to about 10 points now.  Keep these stones connected and you might have a chance.]

))
(;B[do]TR[ec][fd]C[Tenuki might be an interesting idea, treating your marked stones lightly and looking to gain an advantage by making the first move elsewhere.  White cannot gain much by moving again at the top without becoming overconcentrated.]
))
(;B[dc];W[cc];B[jc]LB[nd:B][fe:A]C[This is a basic joseki, and gives you a balanced formation at the top.  Later you can look to play at the marked points - A expands the scale of your moyo while reducing white's, B strengthens your own moyo.]
