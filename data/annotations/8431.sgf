C[Hello,

I am Amygdala, 1d EGF.
I will review this game for white. Aside his "...dubious technical moves, [white\] would like to understand [his\] main mistakes concerning STRATEGY and DIRECTIONS."
I will try to forge my commentary with special regard to these topics.]

(;W[id]TR[om][on]SQ[fc][dd][de]C[The natural impulse would be to strengthen the two tringled stones first and quite probably in sente before playing elsewhere, e.g. with p9. What I like about your move is on the other hand the spirit of attack. You should always look for aggressive moves that keep the flow of stones running. But after all, once more a tenuki feels inappropriate here at this very point.
Apart from that, to attack the group of squared black stones, I would have chosen a lower and thighter move instead: h17.]

;W[df];B[fa];W[da];B[ic];W[kf];B[tt]C[Thank you for letting me analyze this very interesting game.

Let me summarize briefly:
1.
One of the main points of the game was how to deal with the fighting options in the north-western area of the board and how to install a successfull karami (starting with white 44). Here white was lacking the feeling for the proper distance and reading power, the ability to foresee certain sequences.
2.
Two and a half times (the "half time" comprising a favourable ko...) white just missed the opportunity to kill black groups (white moves 55, 98 and 188).
3.
White often did not know when to change the spot of action, he played inappropriate tenukis (white moves 12 and 44).

Now how to improve as quickly as possible with regard to these weaknesses?

To improve the feeling for the proper distance between stones and the feeling for when to play tenuki, replay professional games as often as possible. It is sufficient to do it rapidly without much pondering about moves and without reading the commentaries.

To improve reading power and to increase the awareness of when it is possible to kill a group, solve as many life-and-death problems as you can.

I am sure that you will quickly improve if you follow these hints.]

The aim is rather to push them about under the constant threat of capturing or killing to gain influence in the center that irradiates towards the right side, e.g. with some sort of wall around the triangled points.
An interesting point here is, that you can capture the black group to the left with d14. If black still intends to run out with d12, you will capture one of his groups. So with h17 you set up a karami (splitting attack) in any case.]
