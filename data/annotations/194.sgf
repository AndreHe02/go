(;W[ci]C[connect is better.,];B[dg];W[df];B[cf];W[ef];B[ce]L[bf]C[looks  like black has cut too early, but using stones more efficienly playing  'a'....]

 osman 3k*: different sort of opening here !
you bet!!];W[ek];B[el];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[hi];W[fl];B[hd];W[ig];B[fm];W
[gk]L[gl]C[better at 'a'];B[em];W[gm];B[je]L[kd]C[playing at 'a' goves more points. w can't die...]

C[wrong  shape?? a weak point at 'a', i think 'b' is better.];W[go];B[me]
C[que pasa?];W[mc]C[yep];B[nj];W[kj]L[mg]C[a calm move at 'a' would do good. you  have cutting points too.]

 osman 3k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[mg]C[ah so.];B[lf];W[lg];B[oe];W[og]
;B[pe]L[qe][lm]C[too  heavy.if he wants to play there, better at 'a'
but 'b' is probably more urgent.];W[kk]C[yeah! :)];B[kl];W[ll];B[lj];W[ki]
C[this fight is hard for  black.];B[ml]C[he has to do something... of course this is bad, but  there is no good move anyway.]
;W[lm];B[jn];W[ij]C[too  early...];B[hj];W[hk];B[jj];W[jk];B[il];W[ln]L[lo]M[il][jk]C[the sequence gave you the marked  exchange, it is not good.
this move is also a bit heavy, better at 'a'?];B[hl];W[gl];B[jo]L[lo]
C[yes... now he has to play here because of the damezumari
but i think if you had played at 'a' instead of the squeeze, he could not  have gone further either, because of the aji.]

'only' 5 stones extra, if anyway he could escape.];B[qq];W[cn]L[co][bq]

at 'b', i think still the stones are dead then.];B[nh]C[he will get his peep-diplome one  day :)]

why say, you didn't play well? i think you didn't do very bad in this game??
oh yes. strange moment to resign... since the loss of the 5 stones is smaller  than a move at 'a' :)]
