C[Up to here I'm still very happy.  I feel that I'll happily give away the r11 stone in exchange for a solid and large topside.]
;W[ri];B[pi];W[rc];B[je]C[At the time I thought that this was a great move.  But in reterospect, I wonder why p17 was so difficult to deal with.  I feel that s17 is too small for white, but if that's true, then how and why is it the case?  Should I s18, which makes his invasion less promising?]
;W[oc]C[So now I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this.  On the one hand I like r18 to prevent him connecting.  But m17 then looks good for white.  And I thought about n17, but it's a bit defeatist as he connects easily at r18.  So in practice I end up making an empty triangle, in the hope that it puts him under most pressure and doesn't give him forcing moves.  But it doesn't turn out well.]

;W[qb]C[So now two big chains on the run - mine and his.  At this point I still feel, even looking back, that I'm ahead, but I suspect I'm in the wrong.  Obviously the key here is not to let my huge group die.

[teabing\] correct. this is called a "running fight". Whoever runs faster wins. The key point are between these two groups until they are both settled or one of them dies.]

(;W[mj];B[ni];W[mi];B[nk]C[So he doesn't risk cutting because I'd cut him too, and he'd lose the semai?]
;W[nn]C[[teabing\] A mistake by white. In this case just run.]
;B[mk]C[[teabing\] excelent]

(;B[ih]C[So on reflection this feels like a wasted move.  I could always m16 to save my stones, and I suppose that it's pushing from the wrong direction.  Maybe m6 better?

[teabing\] Yes. That wasn't necesary.];W[jk];B[km];W[ld];B[lb]
;W[kb];B[kc];W[la];B[mb];W[jb];B[ic];W[ko]C[What to do here.  Obviously k8 is huge.  But is k5 more important?]
;B[jl]C[[teabing\] This looks good. I don't think that your bottom grout will die.]

C[[teabing\] wasted move];W[cj];B[dk];W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[dj]
;W[ci];B[eh]C[[teabing\] last few moves very good. This is what i had in mind but if you had played j8 before that would be easier to achieve.]
;W[fh];B[eg];W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[ej];W[fi];B[ef]C[[teabing\] very good]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[gl]
(;B[gk]C[[teabing\] there is no need to cut here. You have an advantage in this fight and you should play calmly.]
