d13 is necesary but the joseki choice is no good for black. the direction of play is wrong. blacks marked stones are think but not very useful. they cannot easily be used to attack or make moyo]

white is overplaying. you have a dangerous ko to start at A... his group at b is low. so you just need to attack this group and wait for a good time to start this ko]
