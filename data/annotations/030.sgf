 dane 25k*: Good];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[pj]C[A good move. This is big pt for black.]
;B[ph]C[b wants to firm up top side. personally, I'd prefer coming from the bottom as the top corner is already very strong. He could use this attack to firm up the lower side and build thickness on top. This is smaller for black.]
;W[nj];B[nh];AW[li]L[qn]C[M11 too early at this point. The w group is not yet settled and weak. b can play r7, q7, or r8 to put pressure on the weak group. M11 might be better played at a.]

(;B[ch];W[de]C[definitely no threat to life at all at this point. C14 might be better to take the offensive to strengthen the upper corner. D15 is ok, but a bit too passive now. K4 or K16 may be later. C9 would be better than C8 to take one more row, but have some risk of a pincer between it and the d4 stone.
The w group on the right is still weak and subject to attack.

dane (after game): Was D15 too small?  Is there really any threat to life of D17 by C12?
Other moves might be K4, K16 (to threaten a link with M11), or C8.];B[ck]
;W[fm]C[Personally, I don't think so. F7 does not gain much although it definitely asserts center game for w. Joseki at O4 might be better. you'd like to get the lower edge and then use it to strengthen the w group on the right

dane (after game):  Here I was trying to confine C12-9 to edge.  Is this right thinking?]
;B[ic];W[ge]C[I think J17 could be ignored for now. It is a good move for b. Consider the difference if w plays at K17 instead.   G17 might be better, then jump to G15 with B J15. G17 now gives too much to b if he plays into G17.


O3 is probably acceptable, but I think O4 might be preferable to M4. M4 is a bit too far for my taste. O4 assersts center game as well as serve to settle the w group on the right.

dane (after game): Would J15 be better or would it have been even better to ignore J17
and to to M4 or O3?];B[cn]
(;W[dn]C[Too weak. C5 is much stronger. Gives w corner and a base of attack plus some pts for w, which doesn't have much on the board now & without good position.]

It's still baggage for w though.];W[nl];B[om]C[
 dane 25k*: I feel small];W[nm];B[no];W[ln];B[lo]C[w's game play at this point should be connect the 3 groups with a center moyo. w is committed to a cnenter game at this pt, I think. there's still 3-3 at the lower right w should play (there's way too much room down there) and playing into upper right should be considered as threats to gain center.]
;W[kn];B[fk]
(;W[fh]C[black has too much in the lower right. A 3-3 could be played to reduce that. H9 or K10 to connect the left & right group looks better than F12.]
;B[hl]
(;W[hm]C[J8 looks far better.];B[il]C[Yes, I think so. It cuts off the left & right group from connecting. h7 would be better at J7 or k7 to connect tthe groups. Also j8 is possible.

;B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[hd];B[id];W[hc];B[hb];W[gb];B[ib];W[ga]C[not very big. there's still room in the lower right 3-3 and the lower left corner or upper left can be used to attack the left edge group to profit corner pts]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[he];W[gd];B[hf];W[gg];B[hg]C[not really. the j14 group is in trouble and b has good position to invade the w moyo. also threaten to isolate the center rigtht group.
