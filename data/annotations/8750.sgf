C[Jan: hi; i'll not comment every move; just the moves that are somehow strange or good.

feel free to concact me if something is unclear

Jan: very unusual; but interesting];W[qc]C[Jan: The black Stone in the center says: "i want it all"
The white Stone at R17: "o.k. you can have it"

the 3:3 is usual played to take a corner. But at this stage of the game you need influence.]
(;B[pe]C[Jan: let white take the decission how to continue ...]
;W[od]C[Jan: good];B[cq]LB[oe:A]C[Jan: should be at A; but taking a corner is not a bad move here]

(;W[bg];B[eg]LB[fh:A]C[Jan: not good; White can get influence just trying to capturing that stone]

;B[ci];W[ej];B[ck];W[fh];B[fg];W[dj]LB[gh:A][dm:B]C[Jan: I don't get that move. It does not threatening to cut as black can still easy connect. Maybe A or B!?]
;B[cj]C[Jan solid wall for B; White needs to run as it has no eye]
;W[gj]LB[fg:D][gg:C][hg:E][cm:B][em:A]C[Jan: right spirit; but too close; how about A -> threatens to cut at B; or C or E to capture D]
;B[fe]LB[gg:A]C[Jan: no chance to capture the two stones. ... but you still get A for free threatening to capture.]
(;W[ld]C[Jan: good; but too high for my opinion; black can threaten to slip under so 3rd line would be better]

;B[cl]
(;W[fn]LB[fl:B][cm:A][cq:C]C[Jan: no: A! it's late but you might still capture the black group; even if you don't manage to capture, you get some area and might be able to attack C. B had only 3 liberties there is absolute no hurry to capture them]
;B[cm]LB[co:A]C[Jan: now the chance is gone ... You still might try A but it's nothing compared to what you might have gained.]

C[Jan: A is getting weak ... and it's not needed to connect as B is already connceted; so C or D to protect the cut]
;B[mp];W[np]LB[lp:A][iq:D][nq:C][nr:B]C[Jan: no! A must be played here! Black cannot cut at A so C is safe; but Black must not connect to D]

C[Jan: ?? How about A? or B?];B[le];W[me]LB[ic:B][md:A]C[Jan: Bad shape A is better but still C is the big point here]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh]LB[ic:B][kd:A]C[Jan: A or B];W[kj]
;B[ji];W[kk];B[jk];W[kl];B[kd];W[lc];B[kc];W[lb];B[kb]C[Jan: Ok i'll stop here as the game is lost for white here and there is only endgame moves.

Easy advice for White: ... if a situation is settled: leave it alone! Play the big points.

There are lots of moves in this game that belongs to endgame / worth only one or two points but are played in the middle or even beginning of the game.
