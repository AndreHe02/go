AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, my name is Jay and I play as Numsgil on KGS.  I'll be reviewing the game :)

...

I'll mark my comments with N:

...

In terms of a broad overview: have a plan for what you're trying to achieve.  The entire sequence on the left side of the board felt like just responding automatically to white without a clear idea of what you hoped to accomplish.

In terms of your self evaulation, half of the time you thought something went bad, it did.  That's good.  The other half were you responding correctly but not certain if it was actually a good line of play.  Which is also fine; that just comes from practice.

Feel free to email me if you have any other questions I didn't address.]
PL[W];W[dd];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd]C[I didn't really expect E17 in this handicapped game. I made an automatic answer at F16, but maybe I should have played a bigger move.

N: E17 is generally considered too good for black in this position, which is why it's unexpected for white to play like that.  If white already had a stone at K17 or thereabouts, this would be fantastic.  As it stands, the normal joseki gives black too much territory and influence.

As far as whether you should respond or not, F16 is the only move on this board.  Why?

Well first off, it's urgent.  If white gets another move against that stone, white becomes all but impregnable in the area.  If you play F17 you need to follow it up with F16 if white "kicks" like this, or else F17 becomes a bad move.

Imagine if you played elsewhere and white played F16.  Now imagine you played elsewhere for your first move, and white played F16, and your response is F17, and white responds E17.  That should give you an idea of how bad it is to ignore this (the whole sequence seems silly for black this early in the game).

Secondly, even if it weren't urgent, there aren't any bigger moves on the board.  Black's corners are all 4-4 stones, where a followup move isn't all that big.]
;W[hc]C[N: This is unusual, but it makes sense for white in a high handicap game where he wants to make the game complicated for black.

Your goal will need to be to lean against the corner to build up strength to pincer white's pincer stone right back.]
(;B[jc]C[Again, I think I got a little intimidated by white's agressiveness. I answered with a pincer attack to the pincer stone, but I don't know if it was a good play.

N: This is a good idea, but you need to lean first to build up some strength.  See the variation]
;W[ib];B[jb]C[N: You should be careful responding to any white moves if you have to do so on the second line within the first 50 or so moves.

In this case I think it's an okay move, because it helps secure the right side of the top as a strong moyo.  But honestly if I made a move like this I'm fairly certain a stronger player would criticize me for it :)]
;W[hd]
(;B[ie]SQ[fc][fd]TR[dd][ed][gd][hd]C[N: This is okay only if you plan on sacrificing the stones marked square.  Which probably isn't a good idea.  Otherwise, this is the wrong side.  You just encourage white to attack black's weak stones.

How can you tell?

See the line of triangles?  This is a "sector line" formed between white's two groups.  Black's stones are on the line, which means that against a stronger player they are in deep trouble, and you need to try to run with them.  By running white's weak group will come under attack, so running should be a sort of sente here.

See variation.];W[ge];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[ee]TR[ef]SQ[eg]
MA[ed][fd]C[Really slow move. I could have extended to E13 instead, I think.

N: I think square is too far.  Triangle is good, though.  When running, a good rule of thumb is to count how many stones wide you're extending from, and extend that far.  In this case, you have a 2 stone base(X's), so it can normally support a 2 space jump to triangle without fear of being cut.

Sometimes it can support further.  It depends on if you have a plan for handling the cut.  Against a stronger player, assume his reading will crush you, so to keep things simple make up to the safe extension only, and try to think through how you'd respond if white tried to cut.

A good example is the one space jump for a single stone.  If you don't know how to handle the cut effectively, you will get decimated when white tries that.]
;W[fb]
(;B[df]C[What about this kosumi? I thought about closing white to the corner.

N: Closing white in is a good idea, except that white has connected his two groups already.]
;W[gc];B[hg]TR[fc][fd][ed][ee][df]C[Trying to closse white in the side...

N: This works more as building a wall and less as closing white in.  White's corner plus a bit of the side is big enough for white to be happy in the local region, even if he doesnt' get to expand any more.]
;W[pf];B[nd]TR[pj][qj][qi][pi]C[N: This is really passive.  I'd prefer a loose pincer at any of triangle.

The problem is that black is already very strong in this area.  So while black 22 helps secure the local region, it doesn't help attack white or develop another region.]
;W[oj];B[ph]TR[oj]C[White's extension seemed so big it screamed a pincer. Or not?

N: Nomenclature-wise this would be termed an invasion, not a pincer.

Ideally, before you invade a moyo (which is basically what this is), you want to stop it from expanding along both edges.  White can just expand from his triangle stone and your invasion ends up looking a bit silly.]
;W[qe];B[qd]C[N: I don't like responding here, given that you invaded.  Black's invasion stone is suddenly in a lot of trouble.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[rf]
(;B[qg]TR[pf][pg][oh][oi][oj]C[Should have played O12 instead... I would have had more space to breath later.

N: Yes, you are behidn the sector line (triangles), you must run as soon as you have the chance.]
;W[rg]
(;B[qf]C[Bad move, really. I thought about cutting white, but the move just helped him connect.

N: Yes, this doesn't do anything.  See variation];W[pe];B[sd]
;W[pg]C[... and put my stones in atari.];B[qh];W[rh];B[re]MA[oe]
[of][og]SQ[oh][pi][qi]CR[ri][sh][sg][sf]C[At least I was able to cut his group here.

N: Only it's not actually cut, because black's splitting stones are going to die.

Just count the liberties for all the groups involved in the fight.  3 (white, X's) vs. 3 (black, squares) vs. 4 (white, circles).  White's turn,  so for the tie for the lowest liberty count, black's stones are in trouble.]
;W[oh];B[pi]C[N: None of these moves actually net you any liberties.  Just count the liberty count after white responds each time.]
;W[oi];B[ri];W[od]C[N: This is a bit of a mistake by white.  If you're willing to trade a bit... (see variation)]
(;B[oe];W[og];B[oc]C[P15 forced white's P13. But I think that this capture here wasn't a good idea - maybe I shoud had tried to save  my enclosed group on the right side.

N:  Be careful making forcing exchanges just because they're forcing.  Yes, you missed an opportunity here.]
;W[qj]CR[qi]C[With R10, I thought that the group was already lost...

N: Actually, if you got to move at circle you'd have won the capture race.  This white move keeps you dead.]
;B[qm]CR[jp][jq]C[... so I thought I should develop here and prevent white from taking all the right side.

N: This would be fine except that the bottom side is wiiiiidddeee open.  Take it first with a move at either circle.]
;W[qi]C[N: I don't think this is necessary for white at all.  You basically get a free move.]
;B[jp]C[Seemed the biggest move I could afford to play. White seemed far enough... Or should I be more humble? Like a shorter extension on the third line?

N: Either 4th or 3rd line would be fine here.];W[kq]
(;B[mq]C[N: No, you must continue contact.]
(;W[lp];B[kp]TR[mq]C[N: This is a bad move.  You just force white to connect what was already connected while at the same time removing a liberty from your triangle stone.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[lo]C[N: This is called "squeezing the toothpaste", and is generally bad for black.  Notice you just sort of squeeze white out between your two groups.

It usually takes a bit of thought to avoid this, but if you can think of something else you'll always be better off.]
;B[jq];W[mo];B[no];W[mr];B[nr];W[kr];B[ms];W[lr];B[nq];W[mm]
;B[nm]C[N: This isn't super great, since you're attaching against a weak white group.]
;W[mk];B[mn]SQ[di][jr]C[Seeing this move now, it's seems so meaningless. Where should I have played instead? I thought also about sealing at K2.

N: K2 or the other square is where I'd think about moving.]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[lm];B[jm]SQ[dp]C[N: This would be a good move only if you've already secured the corner at square.

As it is, you're building a wall but white has good prospects to invade the moyo in the corner.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[pl];W[ce];B[pk]C[Thought about threatening to connect at Q10. But now it seems not a meaningful move.

N: Better to save this as a ko threat.];W[pj];B[rk]C[N: There are bigger things on the board.  The whole left side, for instance.  White doesn't have a really compelling followup in the area anyway.]
;W[rj];B[sj]C[Bad move. I thought about rescuing the lone stone without seeing the consequences.

N: Even if you could rescue it, it's too small.];W[si];B[sk]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[ql];B[rm]C[... defending miserably. At least I seemed to have a big group stablished. Or that's what I thought.

N: With solid play from both sides, this is all black territory.  But notice you ended in gote, and got only a handful of points out of the exchange.  There are just bigger plays to be made still.]
;W[cf];B[dg]C[Now I think I should have made a hane at C13. Would it be better?

N: The hane invites the cut, and I don't think you can manage both fights at once.  This is fine.]
;W[ch];B[cg]SQ[bh][bf]TR[bg]C[N: Don't do this unless you plan on immediately playing one of square after white plays triangle.

Otherwise you're just helping white remove bad aji.];W[bg];B[dh]
;W[ci];B[di]TR[ej]SQ[cm]C[N: I don't like this.  You're forcing white to take territory, but you're not building much of a moyo in compensation.

If you must go this direction, use triangle.  Your group is fairly secure now, so you can afford to jump.

Otherwise square looks like a good idea.  Build up the bottom moyo while limiting white's ability to expand along the left side.]
;W[cj];B[dk]SQ[ek]C[Chasing from behind... And then I jumped. Really bad call, I think, to try to get ahead. How should I have dealed with white in this struggle?

N: The jump here is especially wrong.  You can only do this sort of thing if you're on the third line being pushed/pushing from the fourth line, and you have 6 liberties.

In the middle of the board, it's always just a mistake.

If you must play here, square is preferable (kinght's jump).]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[cl];B[ck];W[bk]
(;B[el]C[Quite stupid move, it seems now.

N: Don't just make moves to make moves.  What are you aiming to try and do?  As it is, you're building a wall facing the center to build a moyo there, but moyos in the center are notoriously leaky and hard to protect.

Anyway, see variation];W[dl];B[ek];W[dm];B[en]C[Again a one-point jump.I was getting a strong wall towards the center, but couldn't use my thickness efectively.

N: My note from last time still applies.  Don't one point jump like this if it's peeped _unless_ you're on the third and it's peeped from the fourth line, and then _only_ if you have 6 or more liberties.

The problem with the thickness here is that white has a strong group on the right of the board.  So you can't use it as a wall to drive white towards.  And building territory from it directly is going to be really hard.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[hq];B[hp];W[jr]C[Really should have sealed off at K2 before...

N: Yeah, bad bit of aji is coming back to bite you now.];B[hr]
;W[iq];B[ir]C[I guess I was trying to get myself killed! =-)]
;W[gq];B[er];W[ip];B[io];W[jo];B[jn];W[ko]C[N: Sacrificing those stones seems like the best course of action here.]
;B[hn];W[gp];B[fq]C[N: I don't mind ignoring white's atari here.  But...]
;W[ho];B[ep]SQ[io]C[N: ...you _need_ to connect against this atari (at square).

This way, you do secure the corner, but suddenly any territory in the center has evaporated.]
;W[in]C[It certainly wasn't a good exchange. White broke my shape and I didn't get real profit from it. Suggestions on how whould I have dealed with white's G4?]
;B[im];W[em];B[fm]C[N: Be careful now.  You need to have a plan on what you intend to sacrifice if it comes down to it.]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[fn];B[io]SQ[gm]C[N: Seems pretty pointless.

Connecting at square is miles better.];W[gm];B[gl];W[fl];B[gk]
C[N:  Good.  Don't try to atari white's stone, or he'll just set up kos that you don't want to fight.]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[de];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh];B[ei];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[gf];B[fo]C[N: Notice that you have very little territory in the center now.

This is what I meant about center moyos being "leaky".];W[go]
;B[gr];W[fp];B[eo]TR[cn]C[N: This is a good example where teh reflexive play isn't all that great.

A play at triangle or thereabouts is much bigger.];W[dn];B[co]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[an]TR[bo]C[N: Generally speaking, this sort of end game descent isn't as good as just solidly connecting at triangle.

In this particular case, I think the end result is even either way, but there are situations where you'll want to just solidly connect because you get a sente followup that way.]
;W[am];B[bp];W[bl]C[N: I'm not sure what white is defending against...

You get a free move.

See variation for something you can try and trick white with.]
(;B[ih]C[I thought about defending the cutting point at H12. But now it seems to be a slow move, which helped white take a lot of profit in the center.

N: Depending on how confident you are about handling the cut, this is an okay move.  The thing is, if white cut, your center stones would have to struggle to make life.  Against a stronger player, that's a struggly indeed.

The center is basically dame for both players anyway.  Don't sweath white grabbing a few points.]
;W[kh];B[kf];W[le];B[ld]TR[lf]C[N: No, don't attach against weak stones.  Also don't let white push you around.  This is an overplay.

I'd play triangle.  Aim to capture the stone whole.];W[lf];B[ke]
;W[kg];B[jj];W[fk];B[fj];W[fm];B[gj]C[I was worried about white cutting here. Reading it now, it doens't seem to be so dangerous.

N: I'd absolutely defend here, right now, even if you can read it's not dangerous right now.

We're well into the end game, so there aren't big moves to make anymore.  Even if this doesn't work, white would end up with a LOT of ko threats here.  Better to remove the aji right now.]
;W[jg];B[ig]TR[if]C[N: Triangle works better.];W[jf];B[if]TR[je]
C[N: Triangle is better _if_ you're confident your center black stones can make life.  Otherwise this was an okay sacrifice (it's okay to play safely and lose a few points instead of playing dangerously and letting white kill huge groups because he's stronger).

As you get stronger, your definition of safe will change, but always balance the risk vs. reward.]
;W[je];B[jd]C[Played without thinking much. Got punished.];W[kd]
;B[kc]TR[lc]C[N: I prefer triangle.  It leaves less aji.];W[md]

;B[nb];W[ja];B[ka];W[ia];B[id]C[Useless move, I think now. In the moment, I didn't want white to cut, which would lead me to connect at L18.]

N: White is playing desperately.  If two pros played from here, I'm almost certain white would not get a living group.]
;B[qo]C[Well, to start: I gave him the corner, instead of hane at R3.

N: Yes, I would take the corner for black and leave white to fend for himself in the surrounding black thickness.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro];W[rr];B[or];W[ps]C[N: There might be some tricky ways to play, but I think from this point, white is destined to live with proper play from both sides.

If white decides to secure his stone on the right instead of any of his responses, you should be able to either lock the corner off from the left side (which is huge) or even cut it in two.

Note that instead of Black 12 here, triangle is also really huge for either side, but then it gives white the chance to make a base for his pincering stone.  I'm not sure which is bigger here.]
