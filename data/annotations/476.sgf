C[I have expressed my thoughts about many moves. It is because I'm
unsure of the correctness of my thought process and I'm trying to develop a
proper way to think about moves. Please let me know when you disagree, but
also important affirm if you do agree. That way I can be more sure that I
was thinking correct. Take your time with this review because I know I have
asked many questions.];B[pc];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[jd]C[This k16 struck me as strange. But I have trouble seeing the
explaining the feeling. How do you view the move?

E: the natural move would be r6
to support q17, or to make a shimari. k16 seems strange to me too.Now W should probably play kakari (likw q15).]
;W[pe]C[good.]
(;B[od]C[Is this move struck me strange because I had in mind the variation
E: B wants to support his previous move. so this is quite possible. W can't play r17 because the ladder doesn't work.]
;W[qc]C[not good - B can cut at r16.];B[qb]C[B lets W get out easily.]
;W[qd];B[pd]C[terrible shape and terrible move. B is reducing his liberties and helps W fix his shape.]
;W[qf];B[oe];W[of];B[ql]C[strange. if B wants a splitting move, he should first peep at q13

then play r9, not r8. r9 can make a 2-space extension to either side.]
;W[qj];B[pk]C[poor style, but it is the fault of the bad location of r8.]
;W[qn];B[pj];W[qi];B[pi];W[ph]C[this lets B seal you in or take r10-r11 stones. instead, q13 is correct - B can't play douuble hane so cannot capture r10-r11, and you don't get sealed in. notice that q13 is also better shape.]
;B[oh]C[I didn't like giving ponnuki but I didn't want to be sealed either.
Any suggestions here or about q10?];W[nf];B[pg];W[pf];B[qh]
C[this is a bad result for you. even after you play s12 to connect, B still can play ko to take the 2 stones. besides, you give B thickness in sente.]
;W[rh];B[pm]C[At this point I thought black would play at top or o4. I was
surprised at this move because I judged black on right as not needing
another move. How do you view black on right?   E : you are right - B does not need another move here. B probably thought (by mistake) that you can connect under at s8.]
;W[md]C[too deep. B can play f17 to strengthen his k16 stone, then cut through your knight move. better to play n15 - this would split B too, without creating a cutting point in your shape.]
;B[nc]C[too cautious.];W[mc];B[rb]C[I was split on s17 and o18. Any opinion here?

E: you should think of attacking k16. this way you can protect the cut around n15 while chasing B, so your group is out of danger. s17 is very small now, and B group is alive anyway so o18 no good.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[nd];B[oc];W[mb];B[pa];W[hd]C[I was not sure how to attack black any thoughts here?

E: this is good, but if B played less sefensively - like playing the ko - you wouldn't get a chance to attack k16. so, better to play this move immediately instead of o18 etc.]
;B[jf];W[ke];B[je]C[I was thinking of protecting cut.
E: good.];W[hf];B[fc]C[after all the super-cautious moves of B, he plays unreasonably here. his group is running in W's area of influence, and he tries to attack... you should h18 here.]
;W[fd];B[gc]C[I felt g17 mistake. Cause looked like I could separate and enclose.
Any opinion here?

E: right. B can live with f17, but this helps you attack k14.
note that you must attack from the center ( l12 etc.), not from the side - B will connect to his thickness.]
;W[hc];B[gd];W[ge];B[ed];W[fe]C[e15 better, now it's easier for B. but anyway, he lives in gote and you should attack his k16.]
;B[dc];W[ee];B[cc]C[I felt a little unsure of sequence after here. Can you comment?]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[cd];B[bc];W[bd];B[gb];W[dn]C[Any comment about d6? Should I have extended from wall or invite
pincer as I did here?

E: first priority is to chase k16 from around l12. then you can make territory in sente, while attacking.]
;B[ck]C[I felt this pincer to far from lower left and too close to my
wall.Your thoughts here?

this is a good pincer, difficult to attack it strongly. remember B has q10 strong wall to run to if he can't get eyes. because he is attacking your d6 stone, he will settle himself easy.
By the way, note B can't connect k16 by j18, because of W h18 B h19 W k17.]
;W[ci]C[you attack from the direction of your thickness - never do that. always strengthen your weal side ( here d6 stone) while attacking. c11 gives you little territory and encourages B to attack d6. while attacking d6, he will get the influence he needs to help k16.]
;B[ek];W[fp]C[[BI couldn't see any good continuation for attacking left group here so
I switched onto corner. Any thoughts here?

E: too late for attacking now... you should try to settle d4 by c4 etc. but f4 is not a bad idea, you can sacrifice d6 and get a position that works with q4-r6.]
;B[co]C[B is on your side :) he should cut at e5 and fight. he is helping you surround him.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[dq]C[This is ok, but remember B can play e4 and f5 and swallow d6-c6 stones. this is ok for you because he dorsn'r get much territory and you get the bottom side.]
;B[eq]C[mistake.];W[ep];B[cq];W[dr];B[er]C[I considered d4 followed by f3 or f2. In retrospect I wish I did. Do
you see better way after Black's b5?

E: you are in a great position here. best B can do is play ko (W c2 B b2 W b3 B b4). if after W c2 B g3, W b3 B c4 W b4 and you win the semeai.]
;W[cr];B[gr];W[bq];B[bp];W[bn];B[br];W[cp];B[do];W[ar]C[mistake. you must block at e5. otherwise, B will be happy to let you take the ko while he gets out at e5, splitting you . you get a small corner and 2 groups in trouble. It is generally bad to let the opponent split through your line like this.]
;B[eo];W[fn]C[I made big reading mistake I thought I could squeeze black.  And
enclose him.

E: you could play g3 first, threatening f2 next. if B protects f2, your f6 works. then B gives atari at f7and d7, and a big ko results. or B can give up f2 and turn at e6, but that is bad for him,]
;B[fo];W[go]C[I know I went bad long ago but at least I wished I had g4 here.]
;B[gp];W[en];B[ei]C[I knew corner could die. But I wanted to set up splitting attack on
upper and right. I had trouble finding any good spot.

E: you must see that the right B group is thick and safe. when B pressed at e11, he got the influence he needed to secure k16, so there are no real targets to attack now. your corner is safe because if B b1, W a4 and you connect to the outside wall. the territory balance is in your favor: B has about 10 pts in lower left, 10 in upper left, and about 8 in upper right. remember there is still the ko at s13. conclusion : you should take the last big point around l4.]
;W[gj]C[not effective. B can settle himself with c12, while biting off your territory there; and g10 does not give you anything in itself.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[gl]C[B is thinkng to attack your wall - he doesn't see the connection at a4 (in ko, but you have a lot of local threats).]
;W[gm]C[again, watch out for bad shape.
letting the opponent get 2 stones across your knight move is bad.]
;B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[kk];B[ho]C[At this point I thought I could save my groups in lower left in  a ko
fight.

E: true.];W[gn];B[in];W[ap];B[cq];W[ao];B[aq];W[na]C[not big enough threat. count stones - you take 10 and lose 14,
and a lot of territory at the 7-8 lines. you need a local threat, like f3.]
;B[an];W[oa];B[nq]C[I felt low in spirits up now. But I expected k10 & another move to
join black's upper and right teams. Or I thought bottom play for black to be
at o4. Any thoughts?

E: first, a personal note : Go is best seen as a trainer for the character, not just the intelect. when you feel 'low in spirits', it is the best time to work on your spirit.
Objectively, you are not in such a bad state. you surrounded almost comletely, on a large scale, the k16 stones. remember they can't connect to g18. so , all you have to do is not give B the whole bottom side - a pincer here will do that - and you can win the game.]
;W[np]C[still thinking to capture B's q line... another general advice : don't go for kill unless you have no other way to win . look for the victory by 1 point.]
;B[oq]C[Now I strongly felt p3 was trouble for black. Your thoughts?

E: no, p3 is ok. if W q3, B n4 and he takes the lower side. as I said, a pincer was better than o4.]
;W[nn];B[nl]C[see how easily B can live, even without the ko at s13.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[lh];W[mi];B[mh];W[lj]C[later I wished m10 at n10 or somewhere else. But I felt time pressure
here. Your thoughts about response to m12?

E: no way to capture here. worse, by attacking from o6 instead of around n12, you push B to save his k16 stones.]
;B[nm];W[mn];B[pn];W[po];B[mj];W[li];B[ni];W[ng];B[nh];W[kg]
C[I know this is piecemeal but . . . here was hard decision to make but
I didn't see good places. any thoughts

E: now it is piecemeal, as B has good pushing moves into the center... had you attacked from n12, it would have been huge.
again, watch the cutting through the l13-m11 knight move.];B[kh]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[dj];B[dk];W[ej]C[too small - B can reduce with his j12 stones. best to do is n3, making B slide inro the corner but preventing him from taking the whole side. however, now you are behind indeed.]
;B[fj];W[fi];B[fk];W[hi];B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[pq];B[op];W[oo]
;B[mq];W[fh];B[bi];W[bh];B[cj];W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[bg];W[ah]

;B[jq]C[here I saw opportunity for something but was not sure how to proceed.
Any ideas

E: you are right, B should have played the more solid l3. however, he still cannot be killed when you cut through his 2-space extension.]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[jr];B[lq]C[I thought m2 for black and I was vaguely hoping to do something with
b6 white team.(like seki) See any possibilities?];W[iq];B[kp]
;W[jp];B[kn];W[lo];B[pr];W[qr];B[os];W[kq];B[qg];W[rg];B[jq]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[kq];B[lr]C[Two reading questions here. 1) I was surprised at m2 cause I thought
o2 lived for black. what is your reading here? 2)  Also I was vaguely hoping
I could see way to get seki for my b6 group if I could get b8.  Do you see
anything?  
E: o2 lives for B. m2 is a mistake.
no way to get seki for g6 group - B has 11 liberties, you 7 after b8.]

;W[mr];B[jq];W[ir];B[ln]C[How would you connect?];W[mo];B[jk]
;W[jj];B[jl]C[How would you connect here?

E: simply j10 is ok.];W[ij];B[qs];W[rr];B[qo];W[rp];B[qp];W[qq]
;B[fg]C[I thought this was mistake. Do you?];W[gg]C[good.];B[lk]
;W[kl];B[ii]C[How would you play here?];W[eh]C[good :)];B[kd]
;W[hg];B[hq];W[ip];B[mp];W[rs]C[Any comments about white and black sequence that follows in LR would
be appreciated.

E: you should win semeai easily.];B[sq];W[qn];B[no];W[on];B[qo]
;W[sr]C[good.];B[re]C[How would you handle?

E: s16];W[qe];B[rc];W[rd];B[pb];W[sc];B[sb];W[ra];B[sd];W[ha]
C[good.];B[ga];W[ia];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[fa];B[ed];W[og];B[ph]
;W[ec];B[kj];W[fb]C[now B is low in spirits, playing badly.]
;B[ji];W[db];B[hj]C[I thought white won exchange but I lost all hope for seki for b6
team? Was there any hope? And how do you assess the exchange?

W clearly won the exchange. just count stones.
when you learn to count who is leading and what is each play worth, you get a balanced game - not trying to take all board, just to win by 1 point.]

appreciated.])
(;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[od];W[jp]C[Was this a good idea for white?

E: yes, this seems good development for both. note that because of p16, W will be less able to lean on the B position if B attacks at r10 or q10. but this is ok because you develop youe star-point stone at q4.]
