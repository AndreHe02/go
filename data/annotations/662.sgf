;B[pd]C[Hi, redeye. This is Kan.
This is my very first review.
Although I did my best, please do not assume my opinion is always right.]

;W[dk];B[ec]MA[dk]C[I think this is a correct move.
But you should always be aware of the marked stone.];W[dd];B[ed]
;W[ee];B[df];W[eb];B[fb];W[db]
(;B[gc]LB[fe:A][gd:B]MA[dk]C[To
me, This move seems too strong because of the marked stone.
Without the marked stone, your move is a way of playing a joseki, the
strongest one.
With the marked stone, your move is probably a overplay.

I would recommend A (see the variation) or B.

Your move inevitalbly leads to a battle.
W has an advantage in this corner when it comes to a battle.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[fg]
(;B[di]C[What about an alternative shown in the
variation?];W[fi];B[ej]
(;W[dm]LB[gk:A]C[This should be A.
Please see the variation.];B[fj];W[gi];B[gj];W[hi]
(;B[kc]C[This is a very bad move.
You must continue the fight.
Please see the variation.];W[hj]C[To my eyes, this is a severe blow to B.]
;B[fl];W[hl]
(;B[cl]C[This is a bad move.
This is not a Kikashi, because you cannot rescue this stone.
The tree-branch shows why.];W[dl];B[fn];W[fp];B[go];W[hq];B[cq]
C[It is hard to judge this move.
But I think it is reckless.
The variation at W#56 shows a reason.

This (3,3) move is a reckless overplay because B has a very weak group of
stones above.
It is very hard for W to kill this (3,3) stone with precision.
But if W is really a good player, he will utilize various Kiki's(Kikashi's)
on the B's above, to eliminate the (3,3) stone.   It is important here to 'feel' that danger.
Do not make two weak stones at a time.];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]

Please see the variation.];B[ar];W[dj];B[ei];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi]
;B[bf]C[Were you sure, when you made
this move, that the next W move was necessary?
I do not think it is so obvious, though I myself would bet it -is-
necessary.
Think a while, at least, in making such a move.
Otherwise, you will lose a precious sente.];W[be];B[in]C[This is a very dangerous move.
The variation at the next W move shows why.]
(;W[jm];B[jn];W[km];B[ip];W[iq]
(;B[jp]SQ[gc][cl][kc]C[Because
the left-side B became a victim of W's attack, W has now a very good
'Atsumi'(thickness) in the center field, and a good deal of territory on
the left.
I think the marked moves should be blamed for this result.

By the way, the variation is my suggestion for this B move.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nd]MA[qj][nc]LB[ql:A][qh:B][oc:C]C[This move is hard to judge.
I cannot agree to it, though.

There are two seperate and stand-alone W stones, which are marked.
B should attack at least one of them.

Your move does not attack either of the two.

Three variations are attached to show my recommendations.];W[md]

(;B[jc]C[I do not think this move is necessary.
This kind of losing a precious sente could be fatal in the whole game.]

;B[mg]
(;W[lg]C[It is hard to tell whether this W move is necessay or not.

The tree-branch shows just one of the variations I can think of.]

blooper.
