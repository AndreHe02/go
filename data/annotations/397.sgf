 charm 1d*: is entering byo-yomi

reid: q10 might feel big, but it's not really.  The reason it isn't
big is that black is already pretty stable on both sides (r13 and r6)
so that white won't be able to find much profit in a splitting attack
(by playing q10 himself).  probably approaching the upper left corner
would be bigger.];W[om];B[qm]C[reid:  now black's position on the right has been pushed down
too low.  white, on the other hand, has the opportunity to
build a nice big moyo on the bottom.];W[cg];B[ip];W[fo];B[nr];W[np];B[fn]
;W[go];B[in]C[reid: black f6 and j6 are a bit contradictory.  they allow white
to split black even more forcefully than if black had simply played
at j6 (instead of f6 first).

Perhaps black should treat j4 a bit more lightly since he has the chance
to connect at p1 later anyway.];W[gn];B[il];W[jo]C[reid:  this looks like good timing for white.]
;B[io];W[fm];B[kq];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo]C[reid: white seems to be a bit over-concentrated here.  perhaps
m5 should be a jump to m6?  or even tenuki?  taking at e6 looks
pretty big.];B[en];W[gl];B[ko];W[cl]C[reid: this looks a bit thin.  d8 would be safer.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[cm];B[gj];W[hk];B[ii];W[ik];B[dj]C[reid: b is taking good advantage of white's over-play at c8.]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[cj];B[lk]C[reid:  hmmm, it's hard to see what the purpose of this move is.
while it atttacks the white groups, I can't see anything really
concrete.  it's difficult to see how black is going to use this
attack to make profit.  a hane at m6 or k9 would be more direct.];W[kl]

 yakko 1k : has entered byo-yomi again];B[mq]C[reid:  I think black's goal here should be to attack the g5
group.  if he tries to save the o3 stones, he probably won't
have time to attack.  If instead he attacks first, then if
white manages to get away, black can decide later if he really
wants to cut at n3.];W[kr];B[ms]C[
