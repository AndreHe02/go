Hello! this is my first review on GTL and i hope it is helpful. I am happy to offer my opinions and suggestions on this game.  Please remember that i am only a 1 kyu. So, take my comments not as rules but as ideas.
I have offered many alternatives in the opening for three reasons:
1~because many consider the fuseki to be the most important stage of the game.
2~ because fuseki is an area of Go
that i personally could use the most
improvement on.
3- the urge by W(that helped lead to the W downfall on the right side/top corner) to reduce the B moyo in lower right could have been avoided by preventing B from building a moyo in the first place.

Where are mayor mistakes ?

Did W have a reason for choosing to play in the diagonal corner, or was it just out of habit?

i have included some ideas on diagonal play unrelated to the review of your game  please see variations later after the game review]

consider A - D]
(;W[eq]C[
 This is not at all a  bad move but,
B is wanting W to approach.
In Go, it is usually best to thwart your opponents plans.

C[B is very happy to get to play a combination pincer/extension in front of his shimari

which is why W should consider 
A,B,&C instead of the marked stone];W[eo];B[cn]LB[cm:A][dn:B]
C[
Joseki calls for B to extend to 
A or B];W[dj]LB[cj:1][hr:A]TR[bg][bh][bi][bj][bk][bl][bm]C[
 i dont like this W move
yes, it develops the star point stone,
but it is an open skirt

W @ 1 may develop your idea in a better way since it extends from the star point and blocks B from progressing along the side.

also consider a move at A];B[cq];W[em];B[kq]LB[dk:A][dl:B][el:C]
TR[hk][hl][jl][hm][im][km][hn][jn][ho][io]C[
B builds solid territory and 
W builds some influence.

I am not so happy with this result for  W,  because the influence built  is imperfect or attackable around the marked points A,B,C.
 later in the middle game fighting this could be a weakness

also B H 4 is high so helps to reduce any center moyo W may build

notice the direction of the arrows from H4];W[jc]LB[qj:A]C[a W move around A may be valuable since it prevents a B "double wing"
formation];B[qj]C[
This is very good for B
B's frame work is solid];W[qh]C[
this checking extension is good
but again consider if W had played K17 at R10 in the first place.]
;B[nc]LB[pf:A]C[consider a W move at A]
(;W[pc]C[W defends the corner which is usually a good thing but>
When W is playing Star points
maybe he should think more about the outside than the corners

nanomoyo:
The absolute best way to handle danger is to prevent it 
W should have defended before trying to reduce . there would have been no complications then.
i looked  at some variations and the best i could find for W was living by Ko.  not something one should be in a habit of having to do with a group that was so strong to start out with.]
