;B[pd]C[I'm not sure who will end up reviewing for me, but I want to start off by thanking you for taking the time to look at my game.  This is certainly not one of my best games, but perhaps you can find some fundamental flaws in my play, and in my way of thinking.



Are there general things that I am doing poorly?  General advice would be greatly appreciated!



I have left a few of my own ideas and comments are parts that I find particularly bad on behalf of B.  Of course, there may be many things that I don't see, or have misconceived.]

;W[hq];B[gp]C[B's groups are both strong. Probably now is not the time to try to strengthen F4.  What do you think?  Perhaps something like D15 instead?

janr: Once black has decided to cut at f4, he should fight and keep white separated.  If he doesnt want to do that, he could simply play tenuki in the first place, threatening to cut later.  G4 is ok as shape]

;B[fl];W[dl];B[fj];W[dj];B[ch]LB[hk:A]C[As a result of dragging my group around from F4, I kept running out.  But after this, it seemed like I was making white quite happy by letting him run along the 4th line.  I thought I had to do something to stop him, so I went for C12...  Is this the wrong line of thinking?

janr: defense first would imply playing at A first, such that the right white group can't chase any further (in sente)]
;W[ei];B[ce];W[cc];B[bj]C[I think that C12 and D15 are kind of weak due to the w stones around them, but maybe getting out with a move like H9 is better here, since the G6 stones are also weak and not in that great of shape.  At this point, I'm already thinking w's position is a bit favorable.

janr: I think it is more urgent to defend the center group.  The group on te left side has already some eye space.]

janr: once black has played at D9, he should continue and connect.  Else white gets a ponnuki in sente.]

(;B[ah];W[nq];B[qn];W[nc]C[Perhaps I should try to do something at the top now.  W is very strong in the top left corner.  On the other hand, the wall at the bottom is also quite large...  What do you think is most urgent?...  I chose M3.

janr: black is helpless as long as white can at will make his walls larger by attacking the black center group.  I would prefer to first strengthen this group.]
;B[lq]C[janr: by creating a second weak group, black gets a lot of trouble]
;W[mp]
(;B[jp]C[I played this move too quickly.  I think it is kind of wimpy.  On the other hand,BM4, WM5, BL5, WL4 doesn't seem like that good of a choice.  Maybe the low pincer at M3 is too bold?  What I can think of offhand would be:

BJ5, WH5, and THEN BM4, WM5, BL5.  After this, if w cuts at L4, he can't cut again at K5, so B can capture the stones.  Still, I don't know if this is best.  What do you think?

janr: having said that m3 was dangerous, the only good shape after m3 is m4.]

janr: first, it is hard to kill the white stones at A since they almost have 2 eyes.  Second, there is no way to enclose the group at B without cutting points.  Therefore, black should not immediately attack those.  One possibility is in variation, the other is to play tenuki for now, strengthening other groups.]

janr: it is true that the game move does not earn many points.  The top is relatively secure white territory.  When in doubt, take the ko.]

What are the general concepts and ideas that I am missing that may be evident in this game?



janr: the guidelines of the Go Teaching Ladder suggest you submit for review 'slow' games.  It makes more sense to comment on moves you thought about than to comment random moves.

janr: I think it is important for black to pay attention to shape.  Avoid bad shape, even if it's not immediately clear why it will give a bad result.  

Thank you again for your help!])
