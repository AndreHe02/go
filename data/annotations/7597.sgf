C[Hi

I played White in this game with an apx equally powerful player.
The result of this game was that I lost for 8.5 points after apx 250 moves.
Looking back at the game I was able to spot some mistakes I made but I am sure not all of them.
Also I am very interested when I went for small win and I didn't take other important points on board. Please point me when I go small and what would other big moves be.

Thx, Radu
p.s. And also, please evaluate my rank (maybe as related to European Rank  http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/ or any other system you might find suitable for you)

Hi Radu,

Please find my review here.  The main points to help you improve are:

- Do Life'n'Death problems (Tsumego).  You don't need to do huge numbers of these - just 5 a day or something like that, but keep doing them.  This will improve your knowledge of living shapes, but also will improve your reading skills

- Don't intentionally make weak groups unless you really need to.  If you make one weak group, don't make another one!  If you have a weak group, look after it before doing ANYTHING else.  Strengthen it by making a move that also attacks your opponent, or which grows your territory, to live purely "in gote", is the way to lose in Go - everything is about sente.

- Keep sente in the endgame.  Don't follow your opponent around - look for the biggest moves that end in your sente.

- Play lots of games, and don't get too concerned about winning and losing.  In fact losing is better, since you will learn something.  If you keep winning the whole time you will not learn much!

If you don't understand any go terms I've used, look them up on Sensei's pages:

http://senseis.xmp.net/ 

Also, if you find me on KGS then grab me for a teaching game.

Not sure of your rating - about 10k is maybe right - it's very fluid at our level (I am about 7kyu and that varies by a few stones either way).

Kind regards,

;B[qj];W[cj];B[mp];W[jr]C[K2 is on the second line, which is known as the line of defeat.  To build territory and reinforce the stone at K4 you should play somewhere around G3 or G4.  

You could also play tengen (centre point K10) here, which in one move maps out a bigger framework than black.  You ask about this move later.]
;B[de];W[cd]C[Would be pincer better in this particular situation?

Pincer is possible, yes, but I wouldn't say better, just different.   Often the best response to a capping move such as D15 here is a knights move, so you could consider B16 or F16.  F16 looks nice as it moves into black's potential territory, and will keep his stones separated.  Also the tsuke (touching move) at C15  is very common - look up this is a joseki dictionary).]
;B[fd]C[Now black has you isolated in the corner, which you generally want to avoid.  Also his stones are connected.]
;W[fb]C[Good local move to keep alive, but you're on the second line again.  Locally I would prefer C15 here as it's 

- on the 3rd line
- it's moving out of the corner
- it's reaching out to your lonely stone at C10
- it reinforces the whole idea that the LHS (left hand side) is your territory.  you have mapped out a nice formation with three white stones during the opening - how about reinforcing that pattern here?]
;B[gc];W[cf]C[Is it too crowded? Should tenuki?

I think this is ok as it does some of the things I mentioned in my last comment.  Jumping as opposed to extending here, has the disadvantage that black can try to push through, cut and start some kind of fight.  I think a simple extension is a stronger move and better shape, but your move is not "wrong" I think.

You are right to think about concentrations though, and if you look at the board now you will see that both sides have an approximately equal share of the board, although I think black is ahead slightly.  It won't take much from either player to grab something in the centre and change that balance.]
;B[od]C[Why? Isn't too passive?

This is a massive move actually, black is a strong player I would say, but yes it is gote (passive).  This reinforces his territory on the top and the RHS (right hand side), it strengthens the corner, and if white now plays around Q14, black can pincer from around R12 and expect a lot of profit (since his corner is strong).

Black could also play tengen here, if he wants a moyo game.]
;W[jj]C[I used this move because I've seen it played many times (at my level) but I am not sure about its role. Is it to destroy Black center influence?

To build a big framework - see how it maps out a big white moyo here.  It's a great move actually as it now swings the potential territory map well into your favour - to address that, black now must reduce this.]
;B[ej]C[Black reduces.  This is a reasonable starting point.]
;W[dl];B[hj];W[il]C[I am trying isolate a large moyo

Yes, it's good play.];B[ci];W[qn]C[Is it too early? Should I first strength the left quarter of board? I am looking at the table and I see Black having 2 sides under controll. Is it right to get worried about and launch right away an invasion? Or should I limit his territory and keep my points? How can I count this decision?

Firstly, black's topside is not perfect because of your stone at F18 (he will need to spend a move at G18 to protect the territory).  So the territory there is big, but perhaps not as big as it looks.  

Secondly, I think you should re-inforce your territory on the left, by responding to the touching move ( at C9 for example).

Lastly, you are right, you don't need to invade here, just reduce.  You can do this by just moving from the K10 stone, you don't need to go immediately in so deep at R6.  Playing R6 creates a weak group that black can attack from above (say at Q7) and in doing so, he will reinforce his moyo in the top right of the board.]
;B[qp];W[ql];B[oj];W[qe]C[You now have one very weak group (R6 R8), you should not create another!]
;B[qd];W[qh];B[oh];W[pe]C[Standard shape.];B[oe]C[I am trying to survive. I think I did it wrong.

I think black is happy to build his territory on top here.  Actually your move at Q15 is fine.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[pg];W[ri];B[rj];W[qg];B[pf]N[<>];W[om]
C[Here: I think I should first make life for my group: S14?

I think S13 might be better since it creates an eye at S12.   Also R14 might work too.  I think you cannot afford to tenuki here, since black can kill this group I think quite easily.]
(;B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[lj];W[oo]C[I managed to make life, but I suppose Black went wrong. Where did it?

Black can play around S7 which has miai (equal opportunities) for connecting at S8 or S6, this will take away white's "base" and leave white with a maximum of one eye (namely at Q7).]
;B[op];W[ij]C[This is an usual move, I'm not sure what your intentions are here?]
;B[hi];W[jh];B[dn]C[Ok, how should I defend? I decided the side.

I think J10 would have been better spent at D5 to prevent this move.  Also both your groups on the RHS can be killed if black wants.

To defend the stones at D8 and C10, C6 looks like a reasonable point to start, or simply F8.  D11 is also possible, but will probably lead to a complicated fight.]
;W[cp];B[el];W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk];W[cl]C[Black quite softly here - helped you get good shape.]
;B[fn];W[gp];B[jf];W[md]C[Again I was scared. I am trying agaim make life.

You are now creating your third weak group!];B[me];W[jc];B[kc]

O18 is better as it protects the cut at N18.];W[nb]C[Fine!]
;B[nc];W[ob];B[pb]
(;W[oc]C[I am kind of doomed: I don't see any way to make life there. I should have go O16 and maybe escape for center?

You should not have created the weak group in the first place!]
N[<>];B[nd];W[oa]C[Futile];B[ma]
(;W[mb]C[Futile, but I hoped for maybe a mistake and anyway I would have enough KO threats.]
;B[la];W[pd];B[pa];W[mo]C[I am trying to threat center group and maybe do some damage. Are there other big moves (yes, S14 I think)

You are right to save one of these two groups, yes.];B[np];W[no]
;B[qc];W[mk];B[lk];W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[km];W[ln]C[Did I loose more than win? I feel so, but I don't know why! Shouldn't cut yet?

No - this is a good result for white - you have got good eyeshape, you have connected to the outside.]
;B[jk];W[ik];B[ce];W[be];B[bf]C[Here is the cut I was talking about.  Had you played at C15 this would not have happened.]
;W[bg];B[bd];W[af];B[ec]C[You are lucky here I think as black might take the corner with C17 followed by B18.  THis is usually the purpose of a cutting move like B14 - it follows the saying "cut on the side you don't want" (as the follow up is to cut again on the side you DO want).]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[eb];W[ck]C[I am small right?

I think there are bigger moves (N2 looks dangerous for example), but this is solid play.  You are approaching the endgame.  If you were ahead, then this is OK, but you are behind in this game, so you must attack to win.]
;B[dj]C[Black is still in the lead.];W[in];B[rf]C[So: I was right about S14? At least my opp believes the same thing as me :)

Yes, this group was just waiting to die.];W[qf];B[rg];W[sf]
;B[sd];W[of]C[Again I try survive. I think I see something.]
;B[na];W[ph]C[I am trying cutting.

It's desperate play - it may just work, but maybe not.];B[og]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[ni];B[nj]C[Now I think Black is mistakening.

I think R11 is better for black here.];W[nf];B[nh];W[mi];B[mh]
;W[mj]C[And I have a cut. In this moment I should win, but...]
;B[li];W[ok];B[kh]C[In the semeai on right, I counted that I can loose, so  I captured.]
;W[pj]C[This is big - you are quite lucky here I think.];B[ro]
(;W[qi]C[This is far not needed, right?

Yes - if black connects, the you can atari S12 - see variation.]
