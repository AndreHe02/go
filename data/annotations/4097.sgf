C[Hi Edwin -

My name is John, your reviewer for this game.

I think most of your mistakes were in the late-opening to middle-midgame.  Comments and variations are dispersed throughout.  There is also a recap at the end.

I am (was) a 2k on KGS but in actuality I haven't played in quite a while.  The reason I took this game was because after looking through it, I think that we have a similar style, and much of the things I had to work through are things I see wrong with your game.  In particular, despite opening on both 4-4s, you seemed to settle on a territory-oriented game (which is fine), but you were giving up too much influence and doing so at the wrong times.

Anyways, feel free to ask me any questions about the review - the most important thing here is to think for yourself, and not take any of the things I say as the absolute answer.  You can e-mail me back at this address, or hopefully find me on KGS as either 'etrynus' or 'eggsandham'.

This was an interesting game, and a pleasure to review.  Hope you enjoy it.

Best,
John

Hi there,
I won this game (playing white), but only just, and was behind until (what appeared to be) a big mistake by
black. I'm interested particularly in where I might have gone wrong in the opening.

Thanks,
Edwin.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[po];B[np]

So far so good from both sides.

;B[cb]C[This is important:

1) Look at this shape
2) Look at the shape from the variation (move 25)
3) Repeat steps 1-2]
(;W[fe]C[I think this move (F15) is quite lacking.  Seems slow and unambitious.  Look at the two moves I suggested for a larger scale approach.  Note that these are only two of many possible moves.

>> This doesn't feel like a particularly good result for white... what would be a better way of playing this?]
;B[lc];W[nc]C[Yes, this is one of those moves that tries to do too much, because your K16 stone right now isn't all that strong.
1) You're not going to be able to connect O17 to K16
2) If you wanted to invade the corner, do it directly
3) You're strengthening M17 in the process.

Personally, I'd go for R17, M16, M15, or D2.

That being said, I think this is one of the most difficult moves of the game.  The only thing I can say with confidence is that O17 is a move asking for trouble.

>> Is it better to invade the corner here? Or play somewhere else entirely?]
;B[jc]C[I liked M15 for B, but this is fine too.];W[ic];B[id]
C[Read my comment on Move 40 before branching out to the variations.]

(;W[jb]C[No!  Basic tactical mistake.  Proverb: "Extend from a crosscut" applies here.

Look at the board on Move 44.  You were right in saying that W is overconcentrated - but O17 has nothing to do with it, it is this atari that causes it.  I am going to attempt to change the way you think about fighting....

Your ataris here and on move 42 build a wall that faces your wall on the E column, netting you ~10 points of territory.  Being the middle game, this is NOT what you should be aiming for.  You should pushing B towards your E wall to attack him.

Look at Variation A for a safe and simple forced sequence that does just that.

The other variations involve complicated fighting using the E wall - I think W will come out on top, but it's really tough to tell for sure.  No need to do more than casually glance through these.

Anyways, the important point is - use loose frameworks for building territory, and use walls for attacking.  Building two walls that face each other for territory is very inefficient.]

>> White stones now seem very overconcentrated. And black is building a large framework on the right.

It seems that O17 caused this problem...];B[kb]C[Small.  Glad you didn't answer.]

(;B[iq]C[J3 is bad - I would prefer H4.];W[hp]C[This exchange is great for W.

Often, a lot of players make a move like J3 because they remember it from a joseki....  See the variation.]

;B[ds];W[fr];B[jf];W[ar]C[>>Maybe this was optimistic.];B[br]

(;W[lp]C[Yeah, leave this for later.  The wall that B builds facing the center from this attack turns out to harm you.

Also, if you were to attack, this isn't exactly B's weak point.  The weakness is in the bad shape he caused by J3.

>> Perhaps better to leave this for later, and reduce the black framework somehow first?]
;B[lq];W[mq];B[mp];W[kq];B[lr];W[kp];B[kr]
(;W[jq]C[Since you don't want to give B another wall facing the center maybe the variation is better.]

(;B[jm]C[Those two stones aren't important.];W[in]
(;B[jn]C[Same thing.];W[ok]C[Yes, P8 is better.  In the actual game, P9 was completely cut-off and worthless.  If that B wall wasn't there you'd have room, and P9 would be a fine move.

Theoretically, this would probably be the losing move (if you hadn't won).

For yourself, I would recommend that you be more wary of the influence that you are giving up.  It is fine to not play an influence-oriented game yourself, but even then whole-board considerations should be a factor in all your decisions (not just what move is biggest).

Since this is just one game, I can't talk with complete certainty.  However, if you find yourself playing a lot of games where you feel increasing pressure to invade in the late-middle game, then I think the above advice will pertain to you.

BTW, the answer to the variation of move 52 is T18.
