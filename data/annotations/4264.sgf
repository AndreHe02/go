-- Hi Olaf!
My name is Sven and I´m somewhere between 12 k (slow game, Dragon Go Server) and 15 k (KGS). I hope I will be able to give some useful hints to you. If something remains unclear, feel free to tell me. 
I have put "--" in front of  my comments so you can better spot them.

I think you and your opponent were not much apart as in terms of strength, as suggested by your KGS ranking. What made White lead most of the time was the advantages he gained from the opening game. Remember that the 3rd line aims at territory, the 4th line at influence towards the center. And you should try to do more "whole-board-thinking": Don´t stick to complicated fights at one spot, which mostly earns just a few points, but - especially when you find yourself unsatisfied with one local result (!) - look if there are more interesting places to play, above all corners and sides, which have not yet been dealt with; that is the big moves you are looking for.
Keeping sente (I do not think you gave it away too often) does not mean pushing and harassing your opponent with seemingly forcing moves, but means to play big moves 
which you opponent can answer or not, and the value of which compensates for the loss you have when the oppenent plays where you just stopped to. (Amen) ;-)

As for the basics (how to link groups, sacrifice another stone to make use of an imprisoned stone, avoid peeping, choosing the right extension, life and death), you 
can nothing but read and exercise, sorry. Do not try trick plays against White - be realistic, else you just waste stones, sente and nerves!

Well, and for your emotions...hmmm...I think the best is playing more often - when you have reached your rank, you should lose 50 % of all games and get accostomed to it.

Hope this all helps.. :-)


{ I have annotated this game (inside curly brackets) with my comments (I am playing black, "omgwtf") to help any reviewer understand my thoughts and afterthoughts.

What I need help with: how to figure out whether a group is dead or alive as early as possible so I don't keep wasting moves on it. E.g. I would be very thankful if any reviewer would comment on when he or she sees a group as dead or alive even though I (or white) keeps playing moves for it.

I also have a problem with playing "big moves" -- I don't know where the big moves are.

Comments like "you should have played ... here instead, because ..." are also very welcome, as many as possible, as they allow me some insights into the stronger player's mind.

In the beginning / middle game, I think my main problem is I keep giving up sente. Confirm, deny?

In the endgame (esp. late endgame) my main weakness is, I think, my emotions. Any practical tips on culling those? I really love Go for the sake of Go, yet I am wearied by feelings of anger at every defeat; I do not wish my own competitiveness or childishness to spoil the game of Go for me. }]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp]LB[qp:A][oq:B]C[-- There cannot really be a mistake at the 3rd move - just a few things to thinks about: you are black, so your oppenent probably is better at fighting... Do you play this stone to get center influence or do you want to secure the bottom right corner? It´s rather some sort of personal style, but if I play black, I prefer to try and get one secure corner, by starting a corner enclosure at A (and continuing later at B).]

{ I was unsure where to extend here, or what was the "biggest play." Is A or B better? Is B a poor configuration? }

-- It was right to extend first, though not at R10 - have a look at the variations.
B is indeed very bad - it invites White to extend from the corner and is too high for Black to achieve anything on the left side. Remember that the forth line is for (center) influence, the third line is for (side) territory.]

{ This is my normal response to someone coming in at 6-3 to my 4-4, but I have never played with the joseki he followed (3-3). }

-- I think there is no such thing as a standard response, but if you are looking for a move that fits most situations, you should resort to the answer at A. The diagonal move as an reply to White´s kakari at 6-3 is only seldom played, and then only if there is already some black fortification on the lower side, let´s say on B.
You do exert some pressure on the attacking stone, but White will nevertheless be able to live, and then there is still enought room for White to invade on the other side.]

{ Here I am afraid to play the 5-5 point to repeat what happened in the lower right corner. }

-- Hmm... let´s pause again and think about the direction of play... your primary stone is on the 4-4-point with relatively wide extensions to both sides. This means, White will be able to live one way or the other - you cannot kill him completely!!! (that is, of course, if no major mistakes are made.) White attacks from the top, so he is willing to give the corner to you, and in return hopes to make some territory on the side and perhaps to link up to his top stones.
Black on the other hand already has some strength around D11, which should be used to exert pressure against the white attacker.

So - by E6 you invite White to invade the corner and don´t get side territory as an compensation, and your strength around D11 is wasted. Have a look at the variation.]
