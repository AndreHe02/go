C[The game seems to have several interesting and/ or turning points; and I am not sure that I have chosen the correct way.

If I had lived in upper left corner I think I would have won the game (I made a reading mistake and eventually he killed my group); but I also think that the game deciding mistakes were done earlier. But where?

I recorded the game afterwards out of my mind.];B[qd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[od];B[md];W[pf]C[As far as I am concerned not a standard sequence. Normally at P14. Considering that W doesnt have a stone in upper left corner, but B in lower right the fight seems to favour B.

Nevertheless, what is B's best continuation? Q15, P15, R14, ...?

klin: Q14 is not seen very often, but still playable.  At this stage, it is hard to say what is the best move.]

(;B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[mc];B[qf]C[klin: R14 is not a good move.  But other moves you need to know the follow up move.  Just like when you played Q15 and P14 cut.  I cannot say they are bad.  But your follow-up moves can make them good or bad.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[qh]C[klin: W R12 too strong.  Should Q12 extend.]
;B[nf];W[nc]C[klin: W O17 slow.  It is the opportunity to play at R17.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[qe]
(;W[qc]C[I think W at R18 would be more troublesome for B

klin: R18? No.  B has P17 sente.  R18 will become a gift.];B[rc]
C[klin: B S17 can R18, then P17.  W R17 is dead.];W[qb];B[rb]
;W[pb];B[nh];W[ph]C[klin: B O12, W Q12 exchange helps W.];B[qk]
;W[oj]C[Turning point 2:
To try to press W against side, eg B at N10 or to try to take maximum territory at side and corner, eg B at P9?
During the game I was for whatever reason concerned about an invasion, if B plays at N10, eg W at R7. But actually there should be nothing because of Q12's weakness...
Now I think that N10 would have been better, strengthens B's centre group and I think that balance of power is in B's favour.]

(;B[ok]C[klin: N10 or P9 both work.  It is a matter of choice.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[nk]C[klin: W O9 not working.  See next.];B[oh]
C[klin: B P12 rediculous move, should P11. If W connect, B Q10, W P12, B N12, W Q11, B P8.  The result is much better.]
;W[pk];B[ql]C[klin: B R8 is even worse.  Should Q10.  If W takes P9, B R10 kills 4 stones.]
;W[pj];B[pl]C[klin: B Q8 is a typical "helping-your-opponent" move.  Should simply Q6.]
;W[ol];B[po];W[mj]C[klin: It is W's turn to play help-your-opponent move. N10 is meanningless.]
;B[li]C[I think that B messed up quite a bit here; several strange moves. Though B got nice territory, W's group has become quite strong.

klin: B center group becomes stronger because of W N10.];W[lj]
C[klin: W M10 keeps helping B.  W should play at L9.];B[ki]

;W[jm];B[ij];W[lm]C[Turning point 3:
What is now the biggest point on the board?
- Upper left corner
- Extension from shimari in lower right corner
- Nobi at J7

Or alternatively:
- Is there an urgent move?

klin: Upper left corner.]
(;B[jq];W[im];B[hl];W[hm];B[gl];W[lq];B[gq];W[gm];B[dr]C[B's group on lower side has a base, but the moves here allowed W to take sente and hane

klin: B D2 huge and important.];W[fl];B[fk];W[ek];B[el];W[fm]

(;B[kr]C[A play at upper side would have been huge, but L2 seems to be urgent

klin: L2 is the matter of life or death.];W[he];B[ke]C[klin: B L15 is the last opportunity to enter the upper-left corner.  The center won't die, because P13 has one eye.  B M16 can kill the center two stones.  Now E18 is a good podition.

No comments beyaond this point.];W[ic]C[At that stage I thought that W seems to be ahead, unless B can take some part of upper left corner. Eventually I made a reading mistake and W killed B.]
