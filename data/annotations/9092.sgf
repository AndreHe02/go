C[Hi,

I had W in this game, and with the komi I
lost by 1.5 points.  I recorded the game up through move 160.  I've included a number of specific questions, but I'd be grateful for any errors you find worthwhile pointing out,
places where I didn't take advantage of my opponent's mistakes, etc.

Thank you!


Hi! I'm Andrew, and I'll be reviewing your game. If while you are watching it you feel dissatisfied with my explanation of a certain move, or just want to know more, take note and please send at ajnz1234@gmail.com
 
Enjoy!];B[dq];W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[co]
(;W[kq]C[Is W6 a proper move?


Traditional theory holds that white should not let black secure two corners. If R4 was instead on the star-point, then W6 or thereabouts would be fine since black would not be able to entirely enclose the corner with one move. Here, black can enclose the entire corner with P3, so L6 is not the best. You must approach the corner.]
;B[oq];W[hq];B[qj];W[jd];B[cf]
(;W[fc]C[With W10, you declared a moyo strategy. Therefore, you must be consistent and pincer black's stone.

Black is already ahead on territory, and that territory is also SOLID territory (compare the two black corners to the open white top side). Therefore, you cannot play any safe, slow moves. Black is glad to make an exchange like this because he can always stay one step ahead on territory.]
;B[bd];W[qh]LB[cc:a][qf:b]C[I've read that one shouldn't be too quick to answer at A -- other responses may look better, a few moves later.
But was W14 too long an extension?


Yes, A would be slow here, since you are behind. Switching to the right side is a very active way to play, taking points while working together with the W4-W10 moyo strategy.
 As for the exact position of this move, usually it is played one space nearer at R13. This is because of the gap left at B. In this case, however, I think it is a fine move, since overextension is perfect for a game where black is ahead on solid territory. Inciting an invasion can only help you. Also, this exerts more pressure on B9.]
;B[oj];W[oh];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd]
(;W[qe];B[re]
(;W[qf]LB[rf:a][pe:b]C[Would A have been better here?


 I think the game move is perfectly fine. A leads to several variations that are actually worse in this case. W22 may feel slack on the corner group, but it is the best you can do. If instead the future cut at B worries you, defending the cut directly with B would be a solid way to play.]
;B[rf];W[qb]LB[rb:A][pb:B][ra:C][ch:D][pe:E]C[This is an excellent endgame move, but it is gote (actually, it is sente, but only if you read about killing later with C after black A and white connection B.) and therefore not as important as whole-board moves like D. Remember that you are behind and need to play actively to catch up.

You may have had the cut at E in mind, but right now, the cut is not in desperate need of protection (in fact, you might invite a black cut there and then attack the invading group).]
;B[rb];W[pb]C[Black needs to defend. If black does defend, then this move becomes sente, making the W24-26 combo a very high-value exchange. But if you do not read that black needs to respond, then you should treat it as a lower priority move compared to those elsewhere on the board.]
;B[cc]
(;W[dg]LB[eg:A][ef:B][dh:C]C[I now think W28 was too close to B's stone
-- was trying to enlarge the moyo.


I think this move is good. If it were closer to the center (at A or B), then black would be able to take lots of territory with C (adding up to more for black than even a white center territory could be).]
;B[df];W[ef];B[eg]C[This is exactly what you want to happen. Black is making the game easier for you because you will have something to attack.]

;W[ke];B[kd];W[jc];B[kf];W[le];B[jf];W[lf];B[mg]C[This is unnecessary for black to do. He is giving you chance to attack by cutting off the black stone from the groups left and right.]

Yes, very good.];B[mh];W[ni];B[li];W[nj];B[ok]

;B[mi];W[ki];B[lk]
(;W[kj]LB[mk:a][nk:b]C[I still wanted to enclose B's upper center group.  But should it have been at A?

I think this move is okay. After black responds with A, there is still potential in the push and cut with B.]
;B[mk];W[gi];B[jh];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[fd];W[ed];B[hf]C[B looks alive.]

(;W[oo]LB[qo:A][ro:B]C[So here I wanted to reduce B's lower right area.

Also a good idea. I think it needs to be a little bit deeper though, like A or B. When black answers at 81 in the game, W80 does not end up having had much effect.]
;B[pn];W[nq]C[and maybe make some area of my own.];B[nr];W[mq]
;B[nk];W[of]LB[pe:a]C[I thought B might play at 86, threatening the cut at A, and then drive into W's upper territory.  So W86 defended.


Sharp defense. 86 is also makes many points compared to other ways to defend the cut.]

---

I end my comments with this move. In conclusion, I want to say I think you did very well with this game, as the result shows: only a 1.5 point loss. I think where you got behind was the opening, especially with move 6 not attacking the corner the lower right corner.That you managed to pull the score to a near tie despite that is very impressive.

Your sense of the game seems quite good. At your level, I would recommend reading Attack and Defense by Ishida Yoshio. You may have already read it. Even if you have, try looking it over again. I've read it over and over many times, and each time something new "clicks", and I can utilize a new kind of strategy in my own games.

Outside of that, the best advice I  can give is to "play, play, play some more, and do tsumego in between." It's the tried and true method.

I hope my review was of help to you. I tried to add in lots of comments and continuations for you to explore. A few times when making the review, I got a little carried away and ended "playing against myself" with sequences lasting 50 moves or more, then writing "therefore the first move is good/bad". I tried to avoid doing this sort of thing in the review I have given you here. My philosophy is that one should explore these continuations on one's own and decide for oneself what is best.


Good luck, and wish you the best,

This result I feel has more potential for white than when white lets black have the two corners. When black has two corner enclosures (like those of D3 and C5), it is solid territory that cannot be contested. This severely reduces white's ability to attack and strategize as a whole. The joseki in this variation sets up this pincer and expands white's possibilities all around the board.]
