RE[W+1.5]

AB[dp][pd][dd]C[This game was played on a dragon based server.  I am black. I want to know where I made errors in direction of play.

[EV\] Hi, this is your reviewer.  This game was fairly peaceful, with no large errors.  B let W catch up a little bit here and there, mostly by playing too softly, not so much from errors in direction of play.  I will mostly try to show places where B could have played more severely, making better use of thickness.]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[qm];B[oo];W[np];B[no]C[[EV\] This push is generally regarded as bad for B, giving W fourth line territory with no guaranteed return.  B can play this way, but he must then make good use of the thickness he is creating.]
;W[mp]
(;B[rq]C[[EV\] So this move is not the right strategy or direction of play.  B must pincer the lone W stone at R7, without allowing it to make a comfortable base, in order to get full value for the thickness earned by pushing at O5.  B is already out into the center, so does not need an immediate base in the corner.  See the example variations.]
;W[qj]C[[EV\] This result is good for W.  He has already caught up close to one handicap stone.]
;B[qg]C[[EV\] Go all the way to R12, to keep up some pressure.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[[EV\] This kick is usually played to make W heavy, in preparation for an attack, or to make W over-concentrated.  Since there are no B or W stones around J3, neither of these considerations apply here, so W will have time to make a perfect extension.  Better for B to just play C6 or D6 without this exchange.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[jp]C[[EV\] As W I think I would play K3, for a better balance with the high stones on either side.  Still, this extension is just the right distance, so B gained nothing by forcing W to play F4.]
;B[qr]C[[EV\] Very big, good.];W[fc];B[cf];W[nc];B[pb];W[jd]
;B[lc]C[[EV\] Certainly playable, if B wants to start middle game fighting.  D18 is a more peaceful but equally good alternative.]
;W[jc]
(;B[nd]C[[EV\] This lets W connect under if he wants.  Can B play N16 instead to capture?  (See variation)]
(;W[db];B[cc]C[[EV\] This move is large but not necessary, as it is miai with C11.  As B, I think I would play N17 to kill all the aji there and secure a nice territory.]
;W[cj];B[cl]C[[EV\] Good, this is the right direction.];W[ch]
;B[cb];W[dc];B[ed]C[[EV\] Very nice shape, but B never made use of it.  W is now very thin.  B should be looking for an opportunity to invade at H17 or to attack the two weak stones on the left side, driving them toward this strength, for a leaning attack.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qe]
(;B[pf]C[[EV\] I think this is possible, letting W live in the corner in return for good thickness and an attack on the two stones below.  B could also consider just playing R16, taking immediate cash.  The W stone at R15 would still have trouble running.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[qi];W[qb]C[[EV\] Is W now alive in the corner?  If so, what is the best forcing sequence for B?  This is worth spending some time to read out.]
;B[pj];W[pk]C[[EV\] Nice move by W, nothing else gives him much chance at sabaki here.]
;B[rj]C[[EV\] Fixing the shape like this seems too simple and helps W run into the center.  Maybe double hane instead, try to confine W?]
;W[qk];B[oj];W[nl]C[[EV\] W makes a clean escape, with little damage.  B lead is already very small.]
(;B[rn]C[[EV\] Safe and large and good, but I think B had an opportunity here to take the initiative and try something more forceful.  B still has a substantial advantage in thickness.  There are no really weak W groups to attack, but there are some severe invasions.   

H17 would be hard for W to answer and would break up W position on top (see variations).   

J4 or K3 also look playable and would put a big dent in the W lower area.  (Try some variations yourself.)  

Now would also be a good time to decide how to attack the two weak W stones on the left side.]
;W[mo];B[om];W[ol];B[mn];W[ll];B[ln]C[[EV\] Difficult fight for both sides.  Note that W is threatening to cut at O6 (starting with Q6).  But I don't really want to get into tactics here.]
;W[pr];B[qp];W[mh];B[fd]C[[EV\] This move gives up a lot, forcing W to fix his weak shape, and it is not clear what B will gain in compensation.  Attack the two weak W stones on the left first.  Keep this forcing move in reserve, to be played if and when needed for a really serious leaning attack.]
;W[gc];B[mk];W[ml];B[mi];W[md]
(;B[pe]C[[EV\] This move is sente, but B had a better attack, forcing W to live much smaller.  The W corner is very thin, so B should look for something severe here (see variation).]
;W[sb];B[mc];W[ld];B[nb];W[ne];B[oc];W[lh];B[kp];W[kq];B[ko]
;W[jq];B[li];W[jl];B[in];W[hl];B[jj];W[hj];B[kh];W[oh];B[pi]
C[[EV\] Submissive.  B has built up a lot of strength around L12.  Can B at least force with the nice shape move L13 before connecting?]
;W[cq]
(;B[dr]C[[EV\] If B gives up this corner, can he get much compensation outside?  The two W stones at F3 are not a large target, given the W thickness at K3.]
;W[cr];B[fr];W[bo];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[iq]
;W[jo];B[ho];W[fn];B[gn];W[go];B[hn];W[fm];B[jn];W[ir];B[hs]
;W[ek]C[[EV\] Looks like W got everything here, corner territory and outside safety for all weak groups.  

Can B do anything on the bottom  However much time you have left on the clock should be spent reading out this life and death problem.]
;B[lq];W[lr]
(;B[mq];W[mr];B[nq];W[nr];B[op];W[oq];B[lp];W[is]C[[EV\] W is already alive, so this move is small, not worth losing sente.  

 It looks like W has caught up, and the game could now go either way, depending on endgame skill.  You wanted comments on direction of play, so I will stop here.  

My main suggestion is to try to play a little more severely.  Giving up territory for thickness is fine, but you then need to strive hard to find a way to use that thickness really effectively.  If you have a big advantage in thickness, your opponent probably has weaknesses you can find and exploit.]
