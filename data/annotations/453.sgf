Review by droid 10k* (IGS rating).

Review requested by dsmith.  Played on 08.25.97 on IGS (I assume).

This is another review by me for dsmith, and standard disclaimers apply -  no offense intended to either player, opinions here are by a humble 10k  player and should be taken in good humor!]
;W[pc];B[pp];W[cd];B[qe]C[Good  for black I think.  It would be hard for him to let white play r15,  although other alternatives are possible here such as k4 or e16  etc...]
;W[qd]C[I don't like this by white.  It sets up black for Q15  followed by an extension down the right side.

Rather, white might P16, O16, pincer around Q12, or maybe ignore black  and play at R6 trying to setup white on right for a better attack on R15  later.]
;B[oe]C[Black should just stick to Q15 here i think.  Then look  forward to extending downward, or pressing white down around P17.

With this play, black invites white to play Q15, which creates cutting  points at both R14 and P14 after black plays Q14, white  Q16.]
;W[kc]C[Interesting, but I think white's job in upper right is not  yet done.  I would prefer white Q15, S15, P16, or O16.]
;B[jp]C[Ok by  black, although upper right corner seems unfinished, and white's play at  L17 might have opened the door for black to take big gains there.]
;W[cg]C[Too low I think.  White may be trying to set a trap for black  here?  Inviting black E17 and then white pincers at h17?  Hmmm.

Regardless, black should be able to follow joseki and live in upper left.   I would rather white played at D13 than C13 at least to get 'up' on the  fourth line for overall balance in the game.  Or perhaps white better  going to R6 or Q9-10 first.  Right side seems more important to me at  this point.]
;B[dj]C[I think black would be better at Q10 now, punishing  white for ignoring the right side.

Since white's space extension at c13 is low, there is a reduced potential  on the left side of the board for white.  In other words, it will be hard  for white to make big territory there as s/he has already limited the  position by playing on the third line.  Also, the two space extension is  fairly strong, so attacking the upper left will be not as profitable for  black.  Putting all this together, I think black has more opportunity on  the right side.

It is interesting to note that every white stone is on the third line,  and almost every black stone on the fourth line.]
;W[cj]C[I think this  battle is bad choice for white.  Black stands to get a big wall facing  downward strengthening his sanren-sei formation at the bottom.

Also, as mentioned previously, white has little need to strengthen the  two space extension on the upper left, and will make relatively small  gains there (at this stage of the game).  White should play where there  is more urgency, and where there is bigger potential.

I would prefer white to play on the right  still.];B[ck];W[bj]
;B[bk];W[fg]C[White finally moves "upward" towards the  middle, but this is not the time or place I think.

White may be trying to secure the upper left, but this would be better  accomplished at E16 or H16 etc...

White may be trying to create a big area of influence (moyo), but if  black next plays at Q10, the moyo for black will be much bigger.

So white should probably still go to the right side.];B[fi]
C[Wrong  'direction' for black as well.  I think this just invites white to  solidify his upper moyo, and doesn't help black's overall cause enough.

Black probaby envisions ownership of the bottom of the board, but it will  be very easily invaded by white at the 3-3 pts in either corner, or by an  invasion on the right side.  Black could have 'punished' white's last  move with a play at Q10.  Then when comaring moyos, black would be far  superior,

I would prefer black maybe at Q10, L15, or even maybe  C3];W[qn]
C[Finally...

The more I look at this however, the more I think white would be better  off playing at Q10 or Q9.    Blacks stones at R15 and P15 stand to suffer if white gets a living base  in the middle, and if black tries to attack from the top to help his  stones there, white would likely get the opportuntity to attack the  corner below.]
;B[qk]C[Good choice locally to use a pincer, instead of  say, black O4.]
;W[qp]C[Interesting play.  I think I might prefer for white to jump out  to P6, or lean on the R9 stone to get influence towards the  center.]
;B[on]C[Ouch - I think black underestimates not only the size of  the corner, but also its value as a base of strength with which to attack  white.   Black better to play at R3 I believe.

Now white at Q3 will be good for white.];W[pq]C[This move makes white  alive and strong and reduces black's lower side, and weakens the black  stones at Q4 and p6 all in one.  Good choice by white.]
;B[qo]C[Bad again  - black is fighting here without his feet on the ground.  Black needs to  strengthen self here before attacking so closely.

Just imagine white playing the double atari at Q5 next - before white  puts the stone down.  Black needs to be able to see this alternative  before placing R5 on the board!  Practice looking ahead a few moves.   Always guess what your opponent will do next.

I usually examine a position, then decide on my move, then reexmine the  position with my move on the board (mentally) before playing, trying to  see what white will do next and verify that my move is ok.  Only then  play the stone...]
;W[po];B[op];W[so]C[What's this?  Typo maybe?

White should capture immediately, ensuring safety and big strength in the  corner.  Then, since white can use that strength to reduce the bottom and  the right at any time, I would plan for white to play the next move  elsewhere, maybe invading the bottom left.  White has already gotten much  more here that s/he should have.]
;B[pn]C[This move would not be good if  white had captured on the last move I think.  At least now it is a  forcing move for black and helps his cause on the right and in the  middle.]
;W[ro];B[oo]C[Not so important yet,  I think black at P3 would   be better, or black at P9 maybe.

Why play this stone anyway?  What if white plays P5 next instead  - will  that hurt black?  I don't think it will.]
;W[qo]C[White could choose to ignore, maybe pushing out at R7 or O3, or  possibly attacking the R9 stone now around Q9?]
;B[pm]C[Bad shape here.   Black could play at P8-9, P3, or elsewhere.]
;W[oq]C[White should probably  try O3 or O2 instead when playing here.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[mp]C[Black is too  kind here.  O2 would be better as a double attack against corner and N3  stone.]
;W[nr];B[np];W[lq]C[White just gets too much in this fight.]
;B[lp];W[jq];B[hp]C[J3 better here.  White will not be able to cut at J4 until  white secures around L3.

Black gives too much away with these moves.];W[kg]C[Big - good for white.   My guess is that white couldn't find another play on the third line that  looked good to him (just joking ;)  All but two white stones on board  before this move are on or below the third line!  Hard to believe.

White probably should have played around here before the fight at bottom,  which should not have gone so well for white.

However, while I like white's strategic intention with this move, I'm not  sure it is good tactically.  Black should still be able to invade the  top.  The stones at L13, as well as F13, and L17 are relatively far from  any friendly stones, and may be ripe for attack.  Black should be able to  use these attacks to make good progress in the game.]
;B[mg]C[Why not mix  it up a bit with black at L15 or L16, an invasion around E17, or an  attack on the F13 stone around H13?]
;W[jk]C[Big jump, but too deep I  think.  Black should be able to separate this stone from the top, and the  kill it.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[pd];W[nc];B[od];W[qb];B[rd];W[qc]C[Reasonable result here since black got sente to play  elsewhere.]
;B[re]C[Terrible.  Completely unnecessary at this time.  Just  as well to 'pass' the move.

Black gives white an extra move by playing this way...];W[rc]
C[And white  gives the extra move back to black!

Bad move - very small value.  White should maybe play C3  now.]
;B[lk]C[Imagine the current moyos becoming territory, and I think  that white will be ahead.  Black's right side and bottom left corner  would not compare against white's three corners and the big top side.

Black needs to try a more aggressive attack - white's top area is big but  very loose.]
;W[ji]C[White is lucky to make this connection.];B[li]C[It is  important for black to learn to see that the right side is not as big as  it seems now, since white is sitting strongly in bottom  right.]
;W[nf];B[og]C[Black is letting white push him around in this game.   The moves at P13, M9, M11, N13, N4, K4, and J4 were all "backing away"  from white.

While it is good that black is not blindly attaching to every white stone  in constant fighting, it is necessary to sometimes 'attack from a  distance' as well as 'defend from a distance'.

For instance, P13 might be played by pushing though white around N16  getting an attack on the top white group that also threatens to swallow  up white's O14.

Black M9 might have been played around K11 as a similar example.]
;W[gm]C[If white can keep pushing into black's areas of influence and get  away with it, why not?

But black has a bundle of outward facing energy from the wall at the  bottom and from D10 and F11.  Black should consider playing around J8, or  maybe cutting white's stones apart at L12, or even possibly just playing  at K10!]
;B[fm]C[Still black 'falls back.'

Note that until black plays at C3, the black lower left corner is not so  big.]
;W[fp]C[For all his conservative early game play, white is very  agressive now.

Simpler for white to play at C3 I think.];B[me]C[Good.];W[ke]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nd];W[nb];B[hi]C[Ok, most of the next  moves are just a pattern of black solidifying the areas of the board that  have already been staked out, and white following suit.

I think that white is ahead in potential territory, so this is a bad  strategic plan for black...]
;W[hg];B[gl];W[hm];B[kl];W[il];B[jn];W[lh];B[mh];W[ki];B[lg]
;W[kh];B[mj]C[Better just to play M10.

Coming back to this move a second time, I think it bears some discussion.   This move, and the few that follow actually turn out very badly for  black, but don't look so bad on the surface.  The notes on the next few  moves will hopefully make this clearer...]
;W[ni]C[Maybe white was  thinking this is a forcing move, but the cut at N11 is not a big threat  right now.  Black should ignore this and/or give thanks for the free  prisoner.]
;B[oj]C[Unnecessary.  And since black is playing inside his own  territory, he is giving a free move away to white  again.]
;W[kj];B[lj]C[Now look back at the N10 move from before (move  81).  If black had just played at M10 instead at that time, then could  this current board position taken place?

If Black played M10 four moves ago, then maybe white would respond at  L10.  But after that, would black waste two moves at N10 and P10 to  respond to a theoretical white move at O11 to arrive at this board?   Definitely not.  In fact black should play zero moves in that case  locally, but play elsewhere.

Since white gets the next move - the result is as if black gives white a  free move, and combine that with the fact that black has wasted a net one  move inside his own territory (his two P10 and M10 minus white's wasted  O11) you can see that black's results here are not good.   
This is a relatively subtle view on these last few moves, and if it is  not clear, do not fret.  The short explanation is that black has given up  'sente' or the initiative, so white can now play anywhere white pleases.   That is bad...]
;W[gn]C[Ok, white uses sente to reduce black's territory  further.  If black had kept sente in the prior moves, black might have  played here first.  White's damage to black here could loosely be used to  calculate the value of black's mistakes since move 81.

Since white will now likely connect the F4 stone to safety, and reduce  black all the way to the bottom edge, white's gains here are huge, on the  order of more than 20 pts at least I think.  This is relative to black  playing M10 at move 81, keeping sente, and playing at F6 before white G6  (or something like this).]
;B[fn];W[go];B[ho];W[hq];B[kq];W[kr];B[kp];W[eo];B[dn];W[do]
;B[ci]C[The plays here benefit  black because white makes some big mistakes.


Actually, black should refocus on the bottom corner, since white is about  to secure a giant territory there if black D4 does not  survive.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[ch];W[bg];B[dg];W[df];B[cf]
;W[be]C[Oops!];B[bf];W[ce];B[ag];W[fc];B[de]C[Black better to atari at E14.

Better yet to play in lower left - maybe at c5.];W[ef];B[ee]
C[Bad - play  E13 and look to cut later.];W[fe];B[eg];W[ff]
;B[mi]C[Why do this?

Now black has a given up a net 2 free plays to white locally for a white  invader that is no threat and essentially dead.]
;W[cp]C[Boom.  Big for white.];B[fo];W[gp]C[Unnecessary for white.  If  white now plays D3, then white will have big bottom left corner.  White's  stones in middle are connected out to top, so cut at G4 is not a threat.

This game is over in white's favor anyway, but this move is like giving  black a free turn.]
;B[bn];W[dq]C[White is now completely safe in bottom  left with probably more points there than black will get on the left side.

Go back to the beginning of the game, and re-examine black's moves on the  left side around D10.  You can see now why they are not as important as  they seemed.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bq];B[ao]C[Too small - black's right  side around S7 is bigger (white will play s9).]
;W[bp]C[White should have ignored black and played  s9.];B[iq]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[ls];B[mr];W[lr];B[hr];W[fr];B[gq];W[fq];B[gr]
;W[ek]C[Too aggressive.  Black should eat this  stone.];B[fk]
C[No need to attach.  Black can play at H9 and still 'eat'   this stone.

White is shooting for cut at F8, but I think it will be  fruitless.]
;W[gj];B[el]C[Bad.  If white tries to push through at E6,  black E7 is atari.]
;W[gi];B[hk];W[gh];B[fj];W[hj];B[hl];W[im]C[Unnecessary.  Black cut here is no longer a threat  since white lives in bottom  left.]
;B[jm];W[ik];B[in];W[dl];B[dk];W[em]C[Free prisoner for black.

If black E6, then white captures at F8, and black connects at G9, and  white's four stones are dead.]
;B[fl]C[Better at E6.];W[en];B[dm];W[cl]C[Oops!  White not paying  attention...]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[bl]C[Completely valueless move - free move to  the opponent.]
;W[rk]C[Good - finally.];B[ri]C[Backing away too much.

Black better at S10 or S8.];W[qj];B[rj];W[qg]C[Free prisoner for black.]
;B[of];W[pf]C[Silly move.  If black  ignores, white cuts, then black ataris at R14, then white connects at  Q13, then black plays at s13 and black is alive white is  dead.]
;B[pe]C[Completely valueless move - free move to the  opponent.]
;W[mf]C[Free prisoner for black];B[lf];W[ng]C[Free prisoner for  black.]
;B[nh]C[Completely valueless move - free move to the opponent.

Unnecessary - white will die inside black anyway.];W[ql];B[pk]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm];B[sk];W[sm];B[mm]C[Completely valueless  move - free move to the opponent.]
;W[lm]C[Free move and free point back  to black.];B[km]C[At least play this move on the other side of the cut at  K8 which gives black one more point at L7.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[kf];B[le];W[lc];B[md];W[sl];B[rk];W[sf]C[Completely  valueless move - free move to the opponent.

Actually this has value, but NEGATIVE value.  White gives black a free  prisoner.]
;B[se]C[Better at T16 by one point or T17 by two points.];W[sc]
;B[rf]C[Completely valueless move - free move to the  opponent.]
;W[ap];B[an];W[kk]C[Completely valueless move - free move to  the opponent.

This is a dame point only - neutral territory.  Playing here does not add  points to white or take them from black.  Neither side needs to connect  at M8 or at K10.]
;B[ln]C[Completely valueless move - free move to the  opponent.]
;W[ms]C[Black may have lost an opportunity here.

I don't think it works, but it is worth exploring what white would need  to do if black played P2 on his last move, since if white captured at N1  then black at Q2 is atari again...]
;B[js]C[This move should have forced  N1 not the other way around.]
;W[os]C[Completely valueless move - free  move to the opponent.]
;B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[dr]C[Completely valueless move - free move to the  opponent..]

C[Ok,  game is over.  White wins  by 12 about points.

If white had not given so many free prisoners to black in the endgame  then the score would have been white's win by about 40 points.

In the opening, black played a better game I think.  White played very  "slowly and lowly" with moves on the 3rd line and only at the top and top  left, while black quickly mapped out a big bottom and right side.

But black's opening was all about influence, which must later be  converted to territory to ensure a win in the game.  When playing such an  influence oriented game, it is imperitive to use that influence to attack  the opponent, and gain territory as a "side effect" of your attacks.   Since black chose to back away from white as white played in the middle,  black actually defeated the purpose of his influence oriented game,  allowing white to make huge progress from what was in the beginning as  very small white starting position.

White was extremely aggressive in the middle game, jumping right in the  middle of black's influence.  Black should have attacked aggressively in  return.  His influence would have given him the advantage in the fighting  and he should have had an easy game.

There were some good lessons about giving sente to the opponent in this  game.  There were MANY examples of both players making completely  worthless moves, equivalent to 'passing.'  It takes some practice and  reading ability to know when these moves are worthless and when they are  not, so given time the players will do this less.  But there is more to a  valueless move than just playing a 'zero value' move - you lose much by  giving sente to the opponent.

In this game, it might be argued that the bottom left was given to white  in this manner.  Since is comprises 10 points for white, and should have  been bigger still for black, the score swing there alone is well over 20  points.  Maybe 50?

The bottom right was a similar case, black played P6, giving white the  corner at Q3 for a swing of at least 30 points.  Hard to measure, but  part of that value is the profit black would have enjoyed if he had kept  white out of the corner and made white struggle for white on the right  side or by running to the middle.  Black's bottom would surely have been  much bigger, and his group on the top right would probably have grown  also.

So for dsmith, this marked a good lesson game for using the sanren-sei  configuration he used at the bottom.  Sanren-sei is an aggressive opening  and requires and aggressive game.  Sanren-sei is NOT about the bottom  (in this game) becoming territory.  In this game, black finished with  less than 10 points below the fourth line at the bottom!

This is an interesting game to review - good for dsmith to pick  challenging opponents!  White started out too conservatively and then  became too aggressive.  Black started out very aggressive and then became  far too conservative. Aint Go  great?]
