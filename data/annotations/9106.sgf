C[Hello!

Thank you very much for taking the time to review this game. I am very unsure 
of what my rank is, but this game feels like what I'm capable of, with normal 
time on the internet. I used to be about 3k - no idea now, as I had a break, a
nd have been reading/studying a lot lately, without playing much.

Anyway, I was pretty satisfied with the game, but I lost, as you can see (4pts
, no komi, I'm black).

Any comments on what should be the main focus of my studies in the time to com
e would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Henrik];B[pd]C[Dear Henrik,

I am Dieter Verhofstadt, 2 dan from Belgium. 

The story of this game was laid out by the early battle in the top left, which turned out to be an interesting corner pattern. Black did not get a good compensation though for allowing White to play twice at the bottom.

From move 38 to 60 both exchanged dubious moves but White came out very advantageous, all his stones being safe.

From 88 to 137 White failed to take advantage from your weak group and destroy the right side. Instead you got a big territory and a safe group. You played well there and made the game even.]

(;B[ce]LB[fo:A]C[I was a little unsure of what my opponent really wanted here, so I decide
d to go to the other corner before settling the lower left.

Dieter: to me, a one space jump at A is the natural move in this position, since you split White's forces on a large scale. See var.]
;W[fp]C[Dieter: this splits Black on a large scale and I do not like that for Black.]
;B[gd]C[I chose to let him play there, and tried to trade for this move, which was planned to be a start of development on the top, and put pressure on whites top left corner stone.

Dieter: It's interesting to play this way but I feel Black is making the game complicated from the start.]
;W[de]C[Dieter: This allows White to play simple cutting and connecting moves.]
;B[dd]LB[fd:A]C[Dieter: I needed to do some research on this position. I've attached a gobase search to the mail.

Initially I thought this move is wrong because it hurts the pincer stone. But that very sequence has been played by professionals, so it is at least correct under some conditions.]
;W[ed];B[cd];W[cc];B[ee];W[fe]LB[fd:B][df:A]C[Dieter: 

In the pro games, Black captures at A and White plays B, damaging the pincer stone. I think that result is only good if your influence works down the right side.

I thought this result would be very bad and you apparetntly thought the same since ...]
;B[ec]C[Dieter: ... you resist. But this move exists in no pro game or any joseki reference, so it must be wrong. However ...]
;W[ef];B[fd]C[(good: White must answer as there is no ko threat large enough)]
;W[ee]
(;B[bc]LB[eb:A]C[... I wonder about the move at A. See the variation.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[bb]LB[fp:A]C[Dieter: 

White creates a living group in the corner and a cutting group in the centre, while you have two weakish groups at the sides. This is an unfair result considering you played twice in that corner, in exchange for allowing White to play A.

Initially I thought move 11 was to blame, but now I think it's move 21, although 17 is the move that deviates from pro play. We need expert opinion here.

Anyway, this corner pattern is very complicated and I don't think Black gains a fair compensation for A. The fight is so heavy that it will dominate the board for some time (or should).]
;B[bd];W[fb];B[ab];W[gb]LB[cb:A]C[Dieter:

White starts crawling on the second line here, while I think A is vital for at least two groups.]
;B[id];W[jc]LB[cb:A]C[Dieter: White plays as if he's the one in trouble. A simple connection at "A" however makes the group alive and unsettles Black's group]
;B[hb]C[Turns out to be a mistake, and causes the loss of the four stones with F17

Dieter: I agree it's bad but it doesn't cause the loss of those stones.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc]LB[hd:A]C[Dieter: at this point, I think A is sente for both. See variations.]

(;B[cg]C[This is most likely as far from any joseki you can come, but I felt ok with making white low, while eyeing a potential attack on the white crosss at E15 eventually.

Dieter: White is low at the top all right, but the black stones are heavy.]

(;W[dh];B[ld]LB[ch:A]C[Dieter: this is not the right place. A is too big:

1) it is almost sente against the top left, so Black needs to live small
2) it creates a deep sphere of influence on the left side, together with the bottom stones.
3) it strengthens WHite's weakest group];W[ch];B[mc]C[Dieter: as said, White 42 was almost sente against the Black group. 

I can't determine whether your compensation is good enough, but I feel White's life is too easy this way.

Let's see in the variation.]
(;W[nc]C[Dieter: As the variations show, this move by White is inexplicable.]

(;B[mb]C[Dieter: you can make things easier. See var];W[ne]
;B[of];W[nf];B[og]C[Dieter: Good! I don't know what White is fabricating but you get 4th line territory.]
;W[ng];B[cn]C[Should I continue pushing? I felt a move in that area could be more impor
tant.

Dieter: Yes, you should continue taking influence along the right side, almost territory.]

(;W[md]LB[oh:A]C[Dieter: another inexplicable move by White. He should hane at A. See var.]
;B[jb];W[ha]
(;B[od]C[Dieter: however, this move is not good either. You should simply capture three stones.]
;W[kb];B[nd];W[me]
(;B[jh]C[Thiswas probably pretty bad? Should just capture at O18 first, THEN try to put pressure on the white group on the right, if possible?

Dieter: It is very difficult after you missed capturing the stones. See the variation.]
;W[nb]C[Dieter: Of course, this is very easy for White too, connecting all the stones.]
;B[pj];W[eq]C[Dieter: Simplifying the game like this is very good by White.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej];B[cj];W[ei]
(;B[fm]C[Wrong move, I think... My intention was to a) get a way out into the cent
er, b) put pressure on whites group and c) get some stones closer to the ones 
I have in the center.

Dieter: I understand what you are doing, but White's stones are not so easy to attack. I believe you should play more safely.]
;W[dl];B[cm];W[fk];B[en];W[hk];B[gg]LB[cb:A][lh:B]C[Turns out to be a bad move.. :p  My intention was to creat some eye-space
 and keep a bit of pressure on the white centre group.

Dieter: White has invested in strenghtening his group wich was already difficult to attack. I would play A or B to strenghten my weakest groups]
;W[hf];B[if];W[hg];B[kg];W[ig];B[jf];W[jg]C[Dieter: I don't know what such liberty losing moves may mean.]
;B[kh];W[pb]C[Dieter: a bit of a slow move by White, but it is rather big.]
;B[ir]LB[kk:B][qo:A]C[Dieter:

This move is very greedy. The second line scoop out has the potential of another heavy group.

I'd play a big move like A or further strengthen my stones at B.]

 with the rst of my stones center/right?];W[or];B[oq];W[mr]
;B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[pr];B[lr];W[ns];B[ko]C[Loose protection, as I also wawnted to reach out towards the two other grups of mine.

Dieter: the influence gained in this sequence is obviously a great result.]

(;W[nh]C[Dieter: a strong and steady move, but White could also continue at the bottom/]

ect the centre somehow..

Dieter: didn't what?];B[so];W[op];B[sp];W[pl]C[Dieter: strange atari]

(;W[oo]C[Dieter: mistake by White, see var.];B[on];W[oj];B[pi]
;W[no];B[mm]C[Dieter: You played natural moves while White self destructed. The territory is large and the group is safe. What more can you want?]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[lp];B[kp];W[hd];B[lo];W[bg]LB[cb:A][bh:C][bo:B]
C[Dieter: the attack is fruitless if A is available. White should attack at B instead, inducing a move at  C]
;B[bf];W[dg];B[cf]C[I find top left to be safe now, as I see B12 and C18 as miai.
