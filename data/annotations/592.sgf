C[hi, my name is Scott Draves, known as spot on NNGS.
this review is for the GTL on May 9, 1998.];B[dp]C[];W[pc]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[qf];W[qj];B[jq]C[unusual.];W[qn];B[qp]C[this is overconcentrated, better to play O4 and link up.]
;W[nq]C[P3 makes corner even more overconcentrated.];B[oq];W[no]
;B[ic]C[it's hard to argue against a tenuki in the opening, but  white is begging to be cut at P6.]
;W[fc];B[lc];W[qd];B[oe];W[nj];B[gp]C[G4 would be better at D10.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[mr]C[i do not like this white sequence.  P2 at O2 keeps sente better, but either is premature.]
;B[qo]C[bad move.  empty triangle.  better to cut at Q6, force at P1, or
still C10.];W[po];B[rn];W[qm];B[mf];W[nc];B[md];W[cn];B[ck]
C[C9 good.];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[dq]C[D3 unusual.  split your oppenent.]
;W[br];B[dn];W[dr];B[er];W[co];B[kr]C[L2 is an endgame move, it has not strategic value.]
;W[rm];B[so]C[i don't think you needed to respond (the corner group is live).
better to shore up the left side with (eg D7), or approach at
C12 or C13, or built a wall between opposing territories at M7.]
;W[do];B[dm];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq]C[F3 bad shape (empty triangle, cutting point at G3).  better to yield
at G3, strengthening stone at G4.];W[go]C[cut at G3 would have been interesting for white.]

;B[dl]C[D8 is a mistake, it only makes false eye. you have one eye so you must run,
using threat at F6, and maybe E11 and putting pressure on the W group.]
