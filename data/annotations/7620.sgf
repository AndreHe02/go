C[Dear Reviewer,

I played this on KGS with W and won by resignation.
Black, however, played a powerful opening and, by my perception, was ahead during most of the game, until I suceeded with an invasion on S16 that should have failed.
Hence I wonder how you would have handled B's opening and where my overall strategy failed.

Alex: I think you need to look at the board a little differently.  From your comments, it appears that you only notice the good features of your opponent's position and the bad features of your own!  Indeed black was a little ahead for most of the game, but for the first 50 moves the situation wasn't as bad as you thought.

Remember that it's normal for both players to make several mistakes during the game.  Therefore there will be opportunities for you to recover from a bad start if you maintain a positive attitude.

Overall I think you will benefit from:

(a) looking at the whole board on a larger scale.  In particular, you missed several chances to make a san-ren-sei on the left (three star points, D4, D10, D16);

(b) estimating the territories and judging how much you're ahead or behind;

(c) paying attention to the correct timing of invasions: not too early, but not too late!  This follows from (b), and is something you can also practice by studing professional games and trying to guess the next move.  In this game you left your invasion until too late (but you got lucky!)

I will make some more detailed comments throughout the game.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[od]C[Perhaps even more powerful than P17 or Q17 that I used to play myself.

Alex: There is nothing unusual about this opening: please don't be afraid of it!]
;W[po];B[qk]LB[pl:a][qm:b]C[Alex: This move is very unusual.  I don't think it's good, since it puts very little pressure on white's stone.  Normally black would play 'a' (Q8) or 'b' (R7) instead.]
(;W[ok]C[I have no idea as to the value of this move.

Alex: This is where your problems start: you're helping black to make territory.  See the variations for two alternatives.]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[oi];W[pk];B[qj]
(;W[nl]C[Alex: This is too small-scale.  Compare the variation.]
;B[jd];W[hc]LB[dj:a][oq:b]C[Alex: This is a nice move.  Personally I'd prefer 'a' (D10) or 'b' (P3), but it's largely a matter of style.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[jf]C[9 of B's stones are effectively working together controlling a huge corner moyo. I got to invade at some point, but now is perhaps too early.

Alex: Correct, it's too early to invade.  Black only has territory in one place, whereas white has more potential to expand at the left or bottom.  You're a little bit behind at this point, but not too much.  It's still possible to catch up if you play steadily.]
(;W[jq]LB[oq:a][dj:b]C[Alex: 'a' (P3) would be more forceful: see variation.  And there's still the possibility of 'b' (D10).]
;B[qo]
(;W[oq]C[Alex: The concept is good, but it's not quite the right move order.  Compare the variation.]
;B[pp];W[op];B[pn];W[oo];B[or]
(;W[nr]LB[qn:a]C[Alex: This is a complicated position, but I think 'a' (R6) instead is better for white.  See variations.]
;B[pr];W[mq]TR[jq]LB[dj:a]C[even this feels like a bad bargain, giving B 20 points of safe terriory in exchange for sealing off the lower side.

Alex: Correct.  White is overconcentrated here: K3 is too close to the wall.  But N3 itself is not the mistake; it's your previous moves that led to this bad situation.]
;B[cj];W[cm]LB[cl:a]C[Alex: I'd prefer 'a' (C8).  It's more forceful and makes it harder for black to get a settled group on the side.]
;B[cf]
(;W[cd]C[maybe better at b16, aiming at C12?

Alex: No, b16 leaves the corner too weak.  Aiming at C12 is the right idea, that's why I preferred C8 to C7.]
;B[ef]C[Alex: Now is the time to think about invading or reducing the top right.

It's a useful exercise to count the territories.  This early in the game it's hard to get an exact count, but you can guess.  White should get 30-50 points at the bottom left (depending on whether black can invade at C3 or D3), and about 20 at the top left, plus komi.  So if black takes 60 points at the top right, together with territory at the bottom right and left side, then black will win the game.

Consider how you might deal with the top right.  I'll give my suggestions as variations to the next move.]
(;W[eq]LB[qc:a][lf:b]C[Alex: Personally I'd try 'a' (R17) here.  Another possibility is 'b' (M14).  Of course both of those moves are risky.  But since you're a little bit behind in this position, you need to take a risk and hope that black makes some mistakes.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[hb];W[gb];B[ib];W[gc]
(;B[dm]C[powerful, on B's part

Alex: Actually, no.  This just helps white build a moyo.  Compare the variation.]
;W[dn];B[em]C[Now the whole game appears to be forced until my invasion at S16.

Alex: No, there are still a few choices you can make later...]
;W[en];B[fm]
(;W[gn]C[Alex: Your variation (F6) is better.  Possibly you could also consider 'a' (C8).]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[fn];W[fo];B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[jl]C[Alex: The black stone at K8 makes it harder for white to invade the top right...]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[ff];B[ge];W[fe];B[he];W[eg]LB[fg:a]
C[Alex: The solid connection ('a', F13) is slightly better, as it gives black no chance to play a forcing move.]
;B[gh];W[df];B[fg];W[eh];B[ko]LB[ni:a]C[Alex: This is an overplay by black.  If 'a' (O11) instead, the game is over.]

;B[mk];W[nk];B[li];W[rd]C[Alex: If black plays correctly, this invasion should now fail (as you say in your comments at the start).  But you have to try it anyway!]

;B[oe]
(;W[pc]C[Alex: Correct, this move is better than your variation.]
;B[qb];W[ob];B[sb]LB[ra:a]C[Alex: This is black's first big mistake: it should be at 'a' (S19) instead.  Now white has half an eye in the corner (see variation to next move).]
(;W[mc]C[Alex: Correct, this is better than your variation.]
;B[lb];W[mf];B[mh];W[of]C[Alex: Nice move.];B[pe]

;B[mb];W[kc];B[nb];W[nc]
(;B[ld]LB[oa:a]C[Alex: Black's second big mistake: black is filling in his own liberties.  Black should simply play 'a' (P19) instead.  See variation.]
