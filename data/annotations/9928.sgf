C[R: Hello Gustavo,
I'm  Hermann 
and I made this review.

Fine that you (Black) made 
so much remarks to your game.
So I can better understand 
your ideas.

My remarks begin with "R:"];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq]
;B[qk];W[cn];B[cj];W[nc];B[kc];W[qf]C[I'm never sure how to respond the double approach. It happened twice in this game, so I had the chance to try a diagonal move both outwards and inwards. I think the outward move is correct, but I would like to know if the inward one is possible as well.
=================
R: 
Black should make 
the outwards diagonal move
or attach the stronger one
of the approaching stones.

(;B[oe]C[R: This move is ok,

but see as well the variation.];W[qi];B[ok]TR[nc]LB[md:a]C[R: I would now attack the marked stone by playing at 'a']
;W[on];B[iq]LB[gc:B][hc:A]C[ I thought this was bigger than playing at A or B, although I would end in gote after making the base]
;W[fq];B[lq];W[fc];B[hc];W[cf];B[cc]LB[df:a][ee:b]C[R: This is a timid play.
As long as there is much space,
I think it is better 
to attach at the stronger one 
of the approaching stones 
and play at 'a'.
or to play the outwards diagonal
and play at 'b'.
Compare move #13.];W[fe]TR[cc][dd]C[The situation got especially bad because this move seems to attack both my groups. I opted to extend the central one

R: White is going 
to confine the marked stones 
to the corner.
This is the consequence
or your playing inwards.];B[he];W[ch];B[ej];W[bd]LB[ef:a]C[R: As White, 
I would play at 'a' 
giving to Black the corner
but getting thickness on the outside.];B[bc];W[be]

(;B[rd]TR[nc]C[I thought I urgently needed to defend the lower right corner, but this move obviously didn't work because of the marked stone

of White.

R: White has practically 
the "comb formation"
and can get a seki
(see your variation),
but I think it is more effective 
to attack the marked stones 
with 'a' or with 'b'.

R: yes, I think 
this was your biggest mistake,
because now you have
three weak groups:
the A-group,
the B-group
and your last stone #67.

Now White can attack 
one of theese groups 
and his weak group becomes strong.

to settle your stones in the corner and at the same time 
make profit on the outsde];W[qo];B[pn];W[pq];B[qr];W[rr]

R: Yes I agree. My advices are:
(1) Often when it is not posible 
to capture White's stones, 
it may be that driving them 
can give you enough advantage.
(see move #87 and #91)

(2)Good ideas you can find in
Sensei's Librairy (#12)
and in Kogo's Joseki (#124).

(3) Study the games of the GTL
of players of your level.])

You can find in Kogo's Joseki
more variations,
