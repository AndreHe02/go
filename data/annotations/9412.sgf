AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, i'm Fabian (4k KGS). I hope that i can give you some useful hints to improve your game. If you additional questions, feel free to contact me under greuelf@web.de]
;W[pp];B[cc]C[I've played so many handicap games as black with stones on hoshi that I like giving myself the solid 3-3 even though I don't have the best game plan.
Fabian: This may be unusual, but i dont consider this as a mistake. It is good to try out new thing.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[fq];B[dn]C[The big picture from black point of view: In two corner you have played for influence, one corner you saved with territory.]
;W[dr];B[qn];W[ql]LB[on:A][qq:B]C[This is an important point: You have two strategic options: You can go for influence wit 'A' or make territory with 'B'. It is important that you are aware the strategic aim that you want achieve. More in the variations...]

(;B[qq];W[qp]LB[pq:A]C['A' is the right continuation.]
(;B[rp]C[This move comes too early...];W[ro];B[sp];W[so];B[rr]
;W[qo]LB[or:A][og:B]C[Fabian: Locally, this is a bad result and a very bad result when you don't play at 'A'  But when i look on the whole board i have to say that i like your next move at 'B'... ;)]
;B[og]TR[qo][ro][so][pp][qp]C[The effect/potenzial of the marked wall is already reduced.]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[pq];B[sq]C[white got walls on both sides. bad for black]
;W[qi];B[go]C[Fabian: Good! You already recognize important important point for reductions. But the move makes also the black group more stable.]
;W[iq];B[jj]TR[dr]LB[cl:A][cj:B][cq:C]MA[dn][go][dp]SQ[ec][ed]
[fc][fd][gc][gd][hc][hd][ic][id][jc][jd][kc][kd][lc][ld][cf]
[cg][ch][ci][cj][ck][df][dg][dh][di][dj][dk]C[Mmm, tengen...
The problem is that you don't know if you have made a good investment with this move. So what else can you do? Lets checking the big picture, we start with your groups. Are they all alive? Yes. Are they all stable? No. The problem is the bottom left group. Remember? You haven't answered the marked move. So the marked black group is the weakest black group on the board. A white invasion at 'A' is not likely, but with a combination with an invasion on the left side, the black group can lose their base. The next point on our checklist: Open space: You see that i marked the areas. They are pretty big, so an invasion is not a serious risk for white. So stake out your claims, to prevent an invasion. 
I would play on the left side: 'B'. You get profit on on the left side and the bottom left group becomes more stable.]
;W[cj];B[cg]LB[ch:A]C[Right direction, but this your area, you have good support. So you can attack more strongly at 'A'.]
;W[co]LB[cn:A][do:B]TR[cj]C[Fabian: The next move is wrong, bad shape. There are only two moves you should think about: 'A' or 'B'. 'A' is the right move to increase the pressure on the triangle-marked stone. On the other the move at 'A' can end at a local loss for the bottom left corner. But you have to be ready for this kind of exchanges when you play an influence game or you want to attack. Remember that you never can't get all with a one move. ;)
When you play tyou get a wall, but you can not use this wall very well, while white gets easy profit. So 'B' is not an really an option.
Please, look at the variations.]
(;B[cl]C[I ended up getting this white stone but I guess I'm "paying too much" for it.

Fabian: You have a lot of influence and your opponent has just made invasion. Usually in this kind of situations it is your opponent who has to pay for the invasian. Remember: It is not necessary to kill the invasion group, you just need to play moves which "threaten to kill" and make profit an the same time.]
;W[do]
(;B[fm]LB[eo:A]C[Fabian: You should block at 'A' to get a good result. Consider always the natural moves.]
;W[en];B[em];W[cn];B[dm];W[eo];B[jc]C[Fabian: Finally, you got the last big point.]
;W[qc];B[pc]LB[qd:A]C[Not now. At first you have to push at 'A' to reduce the profit of White.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qe]
(;B[qb]LB[jo:A]TR[oj][nk][ml][lm][kn][ip]C[Fabian: You opponent plays tenuki ( your opponent doesn't answer your move) after this move, because you played a pure end game move. When you learn to avoid such a move you are already a half stone stronger. Think about it, it almost like "I pass"
White next move is the right idea at the wrong place. White should invade in the top left area, given that he/she wants to invade. As Black i would expand Blacks moyo at 'A'. This move reduces whites moyo at the same time. I marked the line between the black and white white. On this line you find usually the best reduction/expansion points.]
;W[ld]LB[lb:A][je:B]TR[jc]C[Fabian: You don't have to be afraid of one stone. But when you think that you need to play safe you should play the knight move at 'A'. This assures also a connection to marked stone. In fact, the black group can easily live by itself, so you can solify your moyo while attacking. Look at the variations.]

(;B[mb];W[lb];B[mc];W[lc];B[lf];W[ne]LB[me:A][jb:B][je:C]C[Fabian: First fundamental adivce for a tactical fight. Cut when you can cut! Your next move lacks in severity. Another point: Your next move goes in the wrong direction. When you can surround or seal in a group of your opponet that do it. That is already a good result, killing is not neccessary. So instead of 'B' you should play 'C'. But the cut at 'A' is even more important.]

(;B[jb];W[jd];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[md]C[Fabian: Wrong move from White. White should continue to move out to the center.]
;B[oe];W[nc];B[nb];W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nf];W[rb]LB[jg:A]C[Fabian: So far, both of you made no major mistake in this local sequence, but both of are only answering the move of your opponent. Again your next move, like White 65, is a premature endgame move. If Black plays 'A', White can think about resign, because the white stone are dead after this move. As stated before the only hope for White is an escape to the center and this escape will be paid with profit on the left side.]
;B[qa];W[jf];B[hg]LB[if:A][jg:B]TR[lf]C[Some moves ahead you get problems because of this move. You should just push once more to get a three stone wall which is much more stable. Perhaps you know the famous proverb "Don't push from behind" and you want to ask: "?? That don't fit together!" The proverb is in general right because  you dont want to make opponent stronger. But here the exchange 'A' for 'B' is bad for White. Blacks increased wall affects the moyo, the white wall is already neutralized by the marked black stone.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[kh];B[mi]C[I'm trying to fall back and keep white surrounded. But...
Fabian: The errors came later. I like this move: You attack the white group and also reduce the white moyo.]
;W[ih]LB[ig:A][jg:B][ji:C][jh:D][hc:E]TR[mi][jj]C[As these moves are sente, you can play the sequence from 'A' to 'D'. You make the group heavy ( destroying the structure ), the move 'C' strengthens the connection between the marked stones. Finally, you should protect your weaknesses at 'E'. It is important to not overlook forcing/sente sequence before you continue with your attack.]

(;B[gi];W[hi]
(;B[hj];W[ij]LB[hh:A]C[Fabian: Here you can just play at 'A'. Look at the variation...]

(;B[ik];W[ii];B[gk];W[jk];B[kj];W[gh];B[hh];W[fi];B[gj];W[il]
;B[hk]C[this horrible shape!];W[fh];B[jh]TR[ic][he]SQ[ig][hf]
[hg][hh]LB[ge:A]C[premature: I should protect my cutpoints instead.
I played here just because I COULD do it. I was so proud of having read it.
Fabian: You should not just play a move but also consider the consequences. Your move induce the answer at the square mark. This makes the marked black group even more weaker. You should defend at 'A'.]
;W[ig];B[ji];W[he]LB[ge:A]C[I see no way to handle this cut without a sacrifice, so i would play at 'A'. Nevertheless this is the turning point, here you lose your lead.]

(;B[gf]C[bad shape. what to do here?];W[ge];B[ff];W[fe]LB[ef:A]
C[Fabian.: Just another solid extension at 'A'. The black group has not many liberties, an extension is the best move to increase the liberties and prevents a later hane at 'A'.]
;B[eg];W[ic]
(;B[la]C[Fabian: Premature endgame move. Play when 'A' when you worry about two eye, but i would play 'B'  because black is already at least 20 points behind. Black has to reduce the bottom right or there is no chance.]
;W[ka];B[oa];W[hc];B[ej]LB[hm:A][lq:B]C[Fabian:  White cannot live, so when you want improve the structure, use the extension at 'A'. Look always for multi-purpose-moves. 'A' is a little expansion for black but can also a great help to reduce the white moyo on the right. But this is all not good enough to catch up. I would think about an invasion at 'B' . You have support in the center.]
;W[lp];B[ln];W[no]
(;B[nm]LB[jo:A]TR[jq][kq]C[Fabian: At first, you should improve your connection at 'A' to safe some profit. This move can also prepares further reductions, see the markers.]
;W[jo]C[Fabian: This move  destroys your profit. :(];B[jl];W[jm]

;B[sf];W[se];B[rd];W[rc];B[ma]C[This isn't super urgent since the group can still connect out. but I thought white here would be sente (making this reverse sente) but it isn't.]
;W[kb];B[fc]LB[ee:A]C[Fabian:'A' is still better.];W[de];B[ee]
;W[ed];B[ef];W[ec];B[dd];W[cb];B[db]TR[id][ie]C[Fabian: Good sacrife to keep sente. When the marked would have one liberty it would be a double threat.]
;W[dc]C[overall in fights like this if you see any particular moves and suggestions feel free! I'm looking for both small and big help.]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[fb]LB[bb:A]C[Fabian: Thats hopeless, locally you have to play at 'A']
;W[da]LB[bb:A]TR[de]C[Fabian: Ok, White makes also mistakes. White should play 'A' to activate the marked stone.]
;B[bb];W[fd];B[bm]C[Fabian: Good, a double-sente play];W[bn]
;B[qm]LB[pm:A]C[Fabian: These black stone are still not safe, so will end in gote. Remeber the basic order for endgame moves: Double-Sente, Sente, Reverse Sente, Gote,
At first, just play to threaten a further reduction.];W[rl]
;B[rm]LB[pm:A]C[Fabian: White can catch your stone with one move at 'A', so there is no danger.]

;W[tt]C[I'm also super bad at counting because I thought it looked way more even than it ended up. The 60 point difference surprised me.]
;B[tt]C[Fabian: You will improve your tactical skillz by playing games and by doing a lot of easy problems. Do it regulary, it works.

But judging from the game i have some more specific advice for you:
1. Don't answer the move of your opponent, without considering the whole board. In the opening a premare endgame is almost like tenuki, so you will lose the advantage of one handicap-stone.

2. Look for multi-purpose moves: I gave several examples in the comments.
2.1 : A famous attacking proverb: Make profit while attacking, stop attacking when you do not gain a further advantage from attacking.

3. Use strategic aims to plan your moves. Think in terms like expansion, reduction, building influence and so on. It is important to know which joseki variation leads to territory and which one to a wall or influence. See bottom right corner. 

4. I do not call myself a fighthing player, nevertheless i fight a lot in my games. One thinks i have learned: It is important to not leave a major weakness at my own groups, so keep an eye on it. Before you start an attack, fix your own weakness.

5. I am also still not very good at counting. But you need sometimes just a good estimate to decide where to play and how. Agressive or peaceful.]
