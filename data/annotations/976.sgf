C[Black "a" is on the side while there are still good corner points open. Either of the points marked X seems bigger. A black play on the side here is a bit of a special strategy. In short, black might wish white to invade the corner, allowing black to build up outside influence. If this is black's special strategy, however, one feels that "a" should be one space higher.]
;B[jc];W[cc];B[ec];W[dd];B[ed];W[ce]C[Black 12 would be better at b. See variations.]

(;B[df]C[.];W[cf]C[Black would probably be better with the solid move at b.]

(;B[cg];W[ch]MA[cb][bd]C[Black b would be bold, as Black has the points "X" to aim at. However, after looking at numerous variations, I think black does better just playing as in the game. Tewari demonstrates that black 14 was indeed a mistake. If black played a instead of 14, and then white played 15, black would not then play 14, as it would take away his own liberties.]

(;B[dg];W[bg];B[dh];W[ci]C[Black may wish to play the sente sequence starting at b...

(and "c" rather than "a" is much better in the lower right corner)]
(;B[qo]MA[po]C[Black 20, if in this corner, should be at X. Then white cannot play "a" to make black heavy.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[np]C[Black is heavy.];B[pm];W[ok]C[White looks good and is doing well. Black b would be faster.]

(;B[nm];W[jq]TR[nm][pm][po][qo]C[Black "a" is just plain terrible. It strengthens white without protecting the corner. Meanwhile the marked black stones are in trouble. Locally, black "b" is much better, as it grows black's moyo. Black may also want to take care of the marked stones. These stones are troublesome right now, and it is difficult to know what to do. Running seems to give white a big advantage. Maybe getting a base with the blunt moves starting at "c" is best.]

(;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qc]C["b" is better. The top edge is bigger. Also, White 31 seems unreasonable. See followup.]

(;B[qe]C[White does not have time to connect at a and live in the corner...]
;W[qg];B[re]C[White should die now.];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[rb]C[Black b to kill.

If black wishes to leave the corner for later, then c looks better than a for thte upper moyo.

But the stones at the bottom still seem the most needy.]

;B[rp];W[qq];B[oo];W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn]MA[di][rd]C[The foregoing struggle was just plain ugly. Black has life, but at a very high cost.

White should probably approach thte lower left from the other direction. The left side is played out.

Even so, the lower left does not seem to be the focus of the game. The points "X" seem bigger.]

(;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[b is an option instead of a]
(;B[hq];W[cr];B[dr];W[cp];B[dq];W[br]C[Locally, thte black stones on the bottom are not 100% out of trouble. Poking their nose out, perhaps withthe sequence starting at b, seems reasonble. But, there are even more urgent things....

For example, a play at c might be considered, prior to declaring war on white's weak group on the right edge.]

(;B[pj];W[pk];B[qi]C[All that said, black 70 and 72 are very good moves.]
;W[ir]C[White probably should concern herself with her weak stones. If black plays a move such as b, then white will not have time to harrass the black stones on the lower side. A move on the second line is slow.]

[Think BIG! In situations like this, consider a move like b or c. White cannot afford to be attacking righttt now. Both sides should have a sense that black has more power in this area.]

(;B[fe];W[fj]C[Black 91 misses the point again. White has weak groups that can be attacked.]

;B[oi];W[rm];B[qn];W[na]C[With 135, white lives.

My commentary ends here.   Both players played well tactically, with only a couple of errors in difficult reading situations.

Botht sides should work on identifying where the absolutely most critical point on the board is, and to ignore smaller things.   There are a lot of groups thtat struggled for little lives. Thhis can be avoided by  1) playing lightly
2) moving to the center before struggling for life
3) connecting weak groups
