C[h.: Hello. I played white in the match, and I would really like to have a review of it.

The game was rather exciting to play, but after I replayed it, I saw that it was but a succession of mistakes on the both parts. It would be interesting to see how my assessment compares to one of a more experienced player.

My comments are marked with "h.", though I made them only about my own mistakes.

Thank you in advance.

Hi Maxim,

Thanks for sending in the game to review.  It was an interesting game.  I haven't made too many comments since you identified most of the tactical mistakes.  The main problem with the game is the Direction of Play (see Sensei's site for a detailed explanation).  I think you should take away that lesson from this game and nothing else.  Your fighting skills are pretty good, like cutting when you should do and so on.  I think if you get the Direction thing sorted out you will be a lot stronger.    See the book reading recommendations halfway through the review.  If you have any questions about anything then send me an e-mail.

Direction of Play is so important that if you get that right you can play a strong game against any dan player.  The dan player will win due to his superior knowledge of tesuji, joseki and tsumego, but you will give him a good game.  There is another book called How to Not Play Go which I think you should also read.  It basically tells you about how to think about the game, thinking about the open spaces as much as the stones.

With kind regards,
David.

C[This is making a weak group when you don't need to.  There is a saying "approach from the widest side" which means that you should approach black's san-ran-sei (three star point formation) from the outside around O3 or O17.]
;B[on];W[qk]C[Now you are trying to live in gote.  Gote is the opposite of sente, it means making moves which black can ignore - i.e. which don't threaten black.  White is on the back foot here!  White is on the back foot anyway in Go, since he plays after black on the first move.]

C[h.: This whole sequence I consider the biggest mistake, on the strategic scale. I got 4 points in gote*, while the opponent got enormous walls in two directions and a corner.

But I am not particularly sure when the invasion had gone so horribly wrong.

*(Also, the last move seems unnecessary, at least it could have been sente.)

DCH: Good I see you understand Sente/Gote.  The last move was totally unnecessary at this stage.  In the engame you might want to play that but that's at hundreds of moves away right now.  If black takes white still has two eyes, so you don't need this move.  The 'invasion' went well - you sucessfully installed a living group.  The mistake was playing an invading move in the first place.   Look at black's influence now - it's pretty scary, and he's got that by trading it for 4 or 5 points of solid territory.  I assume you know the principle of two eyes?  Once a group has two eyes you can tennuki (play elsewhere).]
(;B[do];W[co]C[I wouldn't choose this joseki, since black has such a massive potential for territory now that you need to be very careful in handing that to him on a plate.  I would play F3 or G3 here.  It may seems like a passive move, but actually it strengthen's your group and simulataneously takes some of blacks potential away from him.]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm];B[em];W[dl];B[el]C[Now black has a massive moyo]
;W[jq]C[Now you are forced to invade.];B[jo];W[gq];B[dr];W[cq]
;B[ep];W[mq]C[This is a weak shape - can be split if black starts at L3 or J3.  It's called The Lantern Shape.  It's ok if you have some supporting stones around, but since you do not, then you need a stronger shape.  I would play M3 which is very strong and almost 100% alive.  The Lantern is not alive and in fact can be split into two, and one side would almost certainly die.]

C[Good.  Here you are not invading you are pincering blacks lone stone against your strong corner group.]
;B[ge];W[lc]C[Excellent play.];B[je];W[hd]C[This is more of a ko threat I think.  I would play O17 in an even game, or consider playing around Q14 - white needs to control black's moyo.]

(;W[jb]C[h.: The second mistake. Obviously, my group should have been dead after B J18. Am I correct that it wouldn't be possible to kill it have I played there instead of K18? (see variation)

DCH:  Yes I think so.];B[jd];W[ib];B[kb];W[kc];B[eb];W[dc];B[db]
;W[cb];B[hb];W[lb];B[ga];W[fc]C[h.: The third mistake. As far as I played with variations, F18 would have killed the black group.

A looks like a key point yes.  I think at this point, as white, I would be thinking more in terms of reducing black's moyo on the right.]
;B[fb]C[h.: Somewhere around this move I looked at the board and almost panicked. The whole centre appeared to be lost to black, not to mention two corners; while my only big side was wide open and inviting an invasion. But I didn't really know what to do.

DCH: You created this situation with your initial moves.  The san-ran-sei opening plays for moyos.  Your third move - invading inside this structure, just helped black create the moyos.  Had you played outside the structure, you would have made an even bigger framework than black's.  Having made the initial mistakes you are now facing a hard game catching up - always needing to invade, and take gote.  To counter this I would recommend reading some books on the opening.  Opening Theory Made Easy by Hideo Otake is very good as is In The Beginning.   When you've read those there is the Korean Dictionary of Basic Fuseki. Also try to cultivate an awareness of your opponents position and how the likely responses to your moves will affect those positions.]

(;W[dh]C[h.: The fourth mistake. Though as I write this, I think that possibly the outcome is not that bad. My idea is that if I had played E9 the black would have been cut off the main forces. But now that I think more, he probably would have lived on the side anyway. Please see the relevant variation, I don't seem to be able to finish it.

You are thinking about positions on the left, which seem to be fairly stable to me.  I would be looking at the open areas of the board, like the upper right and lower middle.]
;B[fj];W[eg];B[ek];W[eh];B[dk];W[gi];B[hi];W[gj];B[fk];W[ih]
;B[gk];W[hj]C[h.: The fifth mistake, albeit a small one. Putting a stone inside a losing ladder. Perhaps I thought it would somehow help me with my next move, H12.]
;B[ij];W[hh];B[hk];W[ig];B[jf];W[kh];B[lg];W[kg];B[kf]C[As black I would make a wall starting at M14 to make a big territory on the right hand side, i.e. by sacrificing the K17 group.  As black runs to save these five stones he causes white to wipe out his territory]

;W[rf];B[qf];W[qg];B[qe];W[ph];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ok]C[h.: I didn't really intend to capture the R12 group, I just set out on a raid inside the enemy territory, striving to reduce it as much as possible.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[mj];W[kk];B[lk];W[ll];B[lj];W[mm]
;B[kl];W[km];B[jl];W[ln];B[ml];W[lm];B[nl];W[hn]C[h.: Here I thought that I might not only live inside the enemy moyo, but even walk away with some spoils. Or was that wishful thinking?

DCH:  With the position as it is, I think your move here is reasonable.  Odds are in favour of you capturing K5, and living in the process.]
;B[ho];W[go];B[in];W[fn]C[h.: The sixth mistake. It is not that this stone somehow damaged my position; moreover, I got incredibly lucky in that the opponent decided to ignore my peep for some unfathomable reason. But the idea was to somehow surround the J6 group, and from that point of view this move is absolutely worthless. I could not play J7 with or without it.]
;B[hm];W[en]C[h.: More or less the last meaningful move in the game. I was fortunate enough to make this cut, and that decided the outcome. I approximate that my victory margin is in the vicinity of the point value of the captured group.

DCH:  You were lucky here.  Black should have just connected.]
