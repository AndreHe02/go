C[Dear Reviewer,

I am an 8k on KGS, and I play black in this game. I left a few comments and questions inside the game.

Thank you for any criticism or advice!

Jay Cotton

Hi There, 

I am Sen probably around 5k or so.
Although I haven't been playing much but I have some comments on the game.
Overall I think you played rather nicely.
I would give some over view which will help to improve your game overview sense.

(;W[kp]LB[mo:A][mp:B][mq:C]C[Lately I have been building this moyo in the bottom right almost every game. And white can never resist invading as soon as I place the fourth stone in the moyo.

And I am never confident about defending! This is the first time my opponent has peeped like this. Usually they invade at A or B or C. I'm really not sure what is the "proper" way to defend against any of these invasions.
------------
What I noticed is that white tend to overplay the invasion.
So it's really up to you to punish him.
Here normally the invasion will not be around this region.
To punish him you must decide what kind of game you want to proceed.
As you can see in previous variation white has a better moyo game than black.
In view of that you might want to play more territorial game instead.]

(;B[jp]C[well by defending this way black tend to lose out in terms of aura.
you are basically listening to what white is wanting you to do.]
;W[np]
(;B[on]TR[fp]SQ[jo][jp][jq]C[This move is good.
Take note of the triangle position this one of the place you want to snatch to extend the territory of the wall you have made.
Although I must say it's kind of cramp there.
Normally for a wall you would have a simple rule
1 seed wall extend 2 space
2 seed wall extend 3 space
3 seed wall extend 4 space.
So interms of effciency it is kind of cramp here.];W[nn];B[om]
;W[ql]C[Another invasion where I do not feel confident about whether to attack or defend. And even if I knew whether to attack or defend, I don't know *how*.

---- 

here is an example of how white is overplayed.
How you should respond depends on the surroundings.
You might not be able to kill the white entirely
but the idea is to let it live small while you build a great influence outside.
Or
You attack and make territory in the midst of attacking.]
(;B[pj]C[This is not a really ideal.];W[rn];B[rk];W[ro];B[qp]

;W[rl];B[rm];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[si]C[I think this is a bad move that I keep forgetting not to make.]
;W[sk];B[sm];W[sl];B[ok];W[pm];B[qn];W[nl]LB[qi:A]C[Aaargh - white survives! Now I want to play elsewhere and maybe generate a ko threat, but white will exploit my defect at A first.

You made the right choice here to ignore and invade elsewhere.
Most high dan and kyuu players would do so too.];B[cf]TR[ce]
SQ[df]C[this kind of invasion is kind of soft.
the marked area might be better.];W[qi];B[pi]C[Is there a better way to deal with this? I figured I would be better off trading the two stones for influence.]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[rh];B[qg]C[this is good thick move.];W[ce]
(;B[df]LB[cf:A]C[White is about to beat me up pretty bad on the left. My spirits sink and I start playing fast and loose. I would love to learn some alternative methods for invading at this point in the game. Was my move at A a bad idea?

Also, perhaps I should have simply avoided the fight that is about to happen. But, assuming for the moment the fight is unavoidable, how could I do better in such a fight? The result after the next 20 moves seems bad for black.]
;W[de]
(;B[ee]LB[ff:A]TR[bi]C[They say to hane at the head of two stones, but would A be better here?

no hane here.
a is definitely better. alternatively can consider making a root at triangle mark
you can easily forsake the 2 stone make a live group on the other side.]

well that's the key to this win.
white ignore the weak group at the bottom and that proved fatal.]

(;W[nr]C[Now white attempts to escape or survive, and once again I'm in a huge battle that will decide the game. Maybe this is normal for high kyu players?

nope not really.
high kyuu players or dan players has a good overview and they certain wont play extremely.
there is a saying before you can attack you have to make sure all your groups are strongs.
any weak group will be target for being attack.];B[mq]C[good peep]
