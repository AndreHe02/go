C[Ed. note:  This game was played at the 33. Tournament in Bonn this year on 25./26. Feb., round 6 of 6.

dv: I am Dieter Verhofstadt, Belgian 2 dan. Since the kifu ends at a point where Black is better than White in my opinion, I could not comment on the focal point of the Black loss, so I made some notes along the opening.

Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]C[dv: This is a tough way to play for White. Usually, she jumps into the corner right away.]
;B[pf]C[dv: This move is very natural for Black, since it connects the san ren sei stones.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[ld];W[le];B[jc];W[id];B[hc];W[ge]LB[qh:A]
TR[pj]SQ[pd][pf]C[dv: The problem with this joseki for White is that she wants to use her influence against the squared corner stones, with an attack at A, but the triangled sanrensei stone makes such a move difficult.]
;B[jp]LB[fc:A][me:B][cj:C]C[dv: Locally, Black has two options to flee, A and B, so it is logical to tenuki. Negating White's influence at C is natural, but I like your building move here too. Still I would probably prefer C here.]
;W[dj]C[dv: It is hard for White to play a building contest against a san ren sei, but it is natural now for her to use her influence in that direction.]
;B[jj]LB[fq:A]C[dv: This is probably too close to White's influence. A would be natural.]
;W[hq];B[iq];W[hp];B[jn]C[dv: You mention you felt bad about this one. Yet, it is a natural move, building big.]
;W[qj]LB[qn:A]C[dv: A contact play at this stage looks like an emergency measure. It is difficult to predict what will come from it. A would be natural.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[ql]C[dv: A good move. White must solve her own problems now.]
;W[qi];B[oj]LB[qq:A]C[dv: If later Black can play A, the territory is huge.]
;W[rg]LB[ph:A]C[dv: I would split at A.];B[qf]C[dv: Severe.]
;W[qc];B[rf];W[oh];B[pc];W[nj];B[nk]C[dv: A good move.];W[mj]
;B[mk];W[lj];B[md]LB[fc:A][lk:B]C[dv: I understand the move, but since A is still available, it is not so urgent. B would be natural.]
;W[me];B[nd];W[oe];B[jh]LB[lk:A][cn:B][qq:C]C[dv: An overplay, in my opinion. A would be natural.

You can allow a small territory here. Then you can aim at B and/or C to increase your advantage.]
;W[hj];B[lk];W[il];B[jl]LB[ng:A]C[dv: This is probably a bit forced. You could consider a counterattack at A. On the other hand, White has all the work to do in this game.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[jk];B[kl];W[ik];B[kj]LB[ng:A][kk:B]C[Ed. note:  Black resigns ~50 moves later.

dv: It is difiicult to see why. White has all the work still to do. Black's territories are almost fixed. White is also thin around A but Black must care about the aji of B, which does not work right now.

If I could see the rest of the game, I'd may be able to spell out tactics which went the wrong way. In the meantime, I hope the notes were helpful.]
