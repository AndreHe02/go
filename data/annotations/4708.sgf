AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[This is agame that I played on KGS.

Hi, I'm Tom, I'll do my best to review.  In general, I think your play was too defensive and cooperative.  In a large handicap game, you have to use your advantage aggressively and not be intimidated by your opponent.  Always be on the lookout for ways to split groups or threaten death on a group, even if you don't think it will succeed.]

(;B[oe]C[Yes, this is a bad variation.];W[nc];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc]
;W[nb];B[pb];W[kd];B[dg];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[yes, attaching like this is a mistake.  playing around c10 or attacking at h17 is better.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[qn];B[oo];W[rp];B[dj]LB[hc:A][qe:B][qq:C]C[This is too small now.  Your opponents groups aren't very strong.  A move like A splits the opponent into two very weak groups.  B takes control of the corner while simultaneously attacking the R14 stone, and C takes the corner while simultaneously threatening the R6 group.]
;W[dn];B[fq]C[Good, it's better to respond on this side.];W[cp]
;B[dq]C[This is too nice.  play c3.];W[cq];B[dl]TR[hc][qe][qj]
[kq]C[This is a small move.  It doesn't really threaten to kill the white group.  Better to play one of the other, more open sides.]

(;B[dm]C[K4 is pretty big, definitely larger than D7.];W[do]
;B[eo];W[en];B[go];W[kp]
(;B[ip]C[Yes, it's much better to attack from your weak side.  J4 pushes white toward's black's floating stones, putting them in danger.]
;W[np];B[fm]C[This move doesn't really do anything. Your bottom group is alive, so you don't need to connect, and you don't have any center points.  Better to focus on the fight in the bottom right.]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[fn]
(;B[gn]C[A connection at F4 could have prevented most of the mess.  See variation.]
;W[em];B[el];W[fp];B[gp];W[dr]
(;B[eq];W[er];B[fr]C[White has already secured the corner and prevented Black from getting an significant territory or influence along the bottom side.]
;W[cn];B[gq];W[kn]C[You need to recognize this play as an attack on your corner group.  If white kills them, you will certainly lose the game.]

(;B[in]C[Almost worthless.  You don't connect this way, or save your corner group, or make eyes, or make territory.  See possible variations.]
;W[kl];B[il]C[Also pointless, for the same reason.  White's wall builds huge influence projecting on your weak group.  Your wall just points back to your own stones.]
;W[no];B[oh];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj]C[You're trying to reach in to your stones from the outside.  As a general rule it's better to try to reach out with the week group; it increases their liberties and puts white on the defensive.]
;B[oj];W[pl];B[ol];W[om]C[Even now, you might be able to make something interesting happen by playing s3.]
;B[ok];W[pk]
(;B[qe]SQ[ec][pd][ee][oe][dg][oh][oi][jj][oj][ok][ol]C[Good, but you only play this move after giving white the side.  Your wall might do you some good if you use it to invade white's top moyo.  You have so much influence there (see marked stones) you might even be able to kill both groups, and certainly kill one.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf];B[li];W[gf]C[I'm not sure which of the alternatives to F15 would have been better for Black.  I lean toward the move at R3 as it seems to me to simultaneously get some control of the lower right and also puts some pressure on White's mid-bottom stones.

Yes, you should be trying very hard to save those corner stones.  I've added one possible strategy, but there's no way to know for sure what the result will be.]

(;B[fg]C[This is too timid as it allows White to get more territory in the middle without any compensation.]

(;B[kk]C[From here on it's largely a matter of White consolidating his gains.  Black's overall condition doesn't give much chance for denying White his territory.

I agree.  You have some good ideas; I encourage you to think of go more in terms of the life and death of key groups.  White was only able to make such a large moyo on the top and right because you were so nice to white's stones.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me: thn@cs.utexas.edu.]
