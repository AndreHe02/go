C[Hi

I am Radu, around 10kyu on littlegolem and dragongoserver
I am happy to comment on your game. I will prefix my comments with R:. Also, please look after replies within and after your notes (for instance, see below)

Hello reviewer!

I send you a game that I've lost. I'm white!

I've made some tactical errors here and there but I'm more interested in the strategic side of it:

R: well, there is a saying: one can learn play go in 5 minutes, can understand the tactics in 5 years and master the strategy in 50 years... So, my advice is to not look so far to strategy, but rather focus on the tactic fights. Don't be afraid of large moyos, usually you can invade / limit later.

after the opening (fuseki? i don't really know the correct term) I thought I was far ahead. Instead my opponent attacked me wherever he could and managed to turn the sides of the match...
R: yes. fuseki is opening, chuban middle and yose ending of the game. Eh, probably your opp wasn't really scared by your moyos

Am I missing some important concept?

R: I think most important is to master the basic of the tactics. Once you you are able to spot in a glance what group is alive and which one can be killed, your skills will increase

Thank you in advance for your effort!!];B[jj];W[kd]C[R: I see the komi is 5. Usually it is a little higher. W move is an invitation for B to move to diagonal corner.]
;B[cj];W[dc]C[R: B refuses.];B[ge]TR[ce][jf][gk]C[R: unusual move. It should be lower (G10), better would be C9 or other triangled points.]

(;W[dg]CR[de]C[R: why don't take G11? B stone would look weak and trying to strengthen is would simply force W profit. Please see variant.
This way, B has a perfect attack on D9: it makes his stone strong and W weak]
;B[jg];W[hc]C[R: G11 looks beter, because links the 2 corners and attack the B stone. Also, it blocks the perfect invasion for the B: G11. THis works fine with L10, but doesn't help neither D11 or D7]
;B[ie];W[gj]C[R: bold move. Not bad. My choice would still be D9 instead: gives power to any further attack.]
;B[ei]C[R: B is too high. Allow W to create base on bottom and left.]
;W[ek]CR[fc][de][jc]TR[ki][lg][gh]C[I consider this a fair opening! Ive got some territory on the top of the board and I'm reducing black's one on the other side
R: not quite: the circles represent weak points of W, while B looks more powerful, being solid. So in fact W has no teritory right now! Possible W attacks: triangles. But yes: it is a fair fuseki. W gets more potential teritory, while B preserves the initiative.]
;B[gi];W[hi]C[R: adventurous move. W should instead take C3 and wait the B attack more confident.]
;B[hj]C[R: correct move];W[ij];B[hk];W[gk]C[lost a stone but managed to make a live group
R: W lost 2 stones. The group is far from being alive. Just a variant....]

(;B[ii]SQ[hh][ik];W[ik];B[hl];W[gl];B[il]CR[cl]SQ[hh]C[R: B is far too cautious. B has a miai: the rectangles. so B doesn't need to move for the 3 stones. Instead W should be easy to kill now! B just used one of his miai for nothing.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[ej];B[fh];W[fj]C[R: W lsot a chance to make the group alive. What if that stone is lost? Nothing.]
;B[di];W[dj]TR[cl]C[R: this is not the vital point. W still dies! The triangle would ensure the life!]

(;B[bi]C[R: B misses too];W[ck];B[bk];W[bl]C[argh, stupid mistake! luckily enough, my group is still alive
R: not quite. See variant.]
(;B[cl];W[dk]C[R: wrong defense];B[bm]C[R: again B is much to cautious. Should play D2 and W dies!]
;W[dl];B[al];W[dm]TR[fl]C[R: W misses the vital point again! B is there to kill]
;B[fm]C[R: But B allows W lives.];W[fl];B[em];W[gm];B[jk]TR[ce]
[fc]C[ok, now is the part that gets me puzzled. Who is ahead in this position? I'd say white, but my opponents next moves seems to get me...
R: the 2 triangles are critical. Because W can't take both, B will have one. Best W takes C9 (to save the D7) and after BF11 or G11, W has 15 points left up, 15p right up, 6p bottom and 5p komi, B has 22p right bottom, 5p left bottom, 8p in center and 3 prisoner. Total: 41-38. Please also note that B ceded the sente just for nothign, his last move is absolutely futile.]
;W[ce]C[R: very good];B[fc]C[invasion? here?? i *think* is dubious but i don't really know how to answer!!!
R: no, this is a perfect sustainable invasion, allowed by the H11 being far. The correct answer should be to protect H11 playing J11.]
;W[fb]C[R: is not linking the groups, is not strengthening H11, small benefit. Small move.]
;B[ic]TR[jb]C[gosh, should I had made my borders stronger before?
R: yes. I said J11 without seeing before this move. Well, now the things are even more complicated. Personally, I would give up H11 being about to loose the corner.]
;W[jc]C[R: it's ok, if you really plan giving up H11.];B[ib]
;W[hb]C[R: trying to save H11 jeopardizes the corner.];B[jb]
;W[id]C[R: is not helping, better should protect the corner at L12. B has ways to attack and make life for the 3 stones at J12. Once life achieved, W dies in right.]
;B[hd];W[jd];B[lb]C[R: wrong, W has the chance to capture and live.]
;W[kb];B[le]C[R: interesting move. Still, it is rather a gambling, as the corner is not safe, nor the center. A little to early]

(;W[ke]C[R: oh, no. The other way. M10.];B[lc]
(;W[kc]C[R: I personally prefer in this situation to capture. It's safer. See variant.]
;B[lf];W[ld];B[md];W[kf];B[kg]C[i admit this sequence of moves is nothing but panic on the board (even thoug i was playing on OGG online server, which is a correspondence server)
R: if it is turn based game, take your time and develop alternatives to play.]
;W[jf];B[if]C[R: W manages to occupies its own liberties. It is making B life easier. Now B took most of the W teritory on right. The W group should survive if now makes the atari on B stones at J12. Please look for variant at move 60 for better result.]
;W[gd]C[R: first must ensure life, after attack! Greedy is not very productive :)]

(;B[he]C[R: wrong, see variant];W[ja]C[R: good];B[gc];W[fd]
C[R: don't try to save it, to many weak points. Play solid: G12]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[gb];W[ia];B[ec];W[eb];B[dd];W[cc];B[de]SQ[ib]
[ga]C[games goes on a few more moves...
R: Wrong! B should play atari at E9!
Attention: W big group in right up is not yet alive!!! Well, it has miai the rectangles.]
;W[df]CR[ef]C[R: oh no, W should pull out his center stones. After, B could try live, but small chances.]
;B[ff];C[Result: B+R
R: Now the score is somewhere around 42-27 for B.
Few thoughts: 
Work on the life and death area. Master the principles of live and dead groups, and you gain much more strength in your play. 
Also, watch for the aji. They might be irrelevant, but here is the key in many games. The aji is the gate for invading, for destroying a group or even for dooming the opp in an area. Force opp to create aji, be careful with your own one.
A sure play to reduce the own aji points (I saw too many in this game) is to play solid. One space jump is the best linked move. Diagonal play also. On the side, 2 space jump works too. Otherwise, knight move or more than 2 spaces jump can be used only in the presence of a powerful group or for special goals, like capturing.
Always count: how many sure points are achieved. Which are the possible attacks on both side.
And most important by far, always ask yourself: is this group surely alive? If not, where can be attacked? And ask these for both your and opp groups. Your groups may need reinforcement to survive, or you could kill your opp group. As a gold rule, the only alive group is the one which has 2 eyes. Any other group, is questionable. If you don't see at the first look the answer to the question "is this group alive?" try several variants. Try to kill it, try to make it alive. Try every possible variation, even the not obvious ones. I recommed you for beginning http://senseis.xmp.net and http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/learn/golearn.html as starting points. Do lot of life and death problems, even if at the beginning you'll pick at the solution. 
A perfect example is the fight for the center bottom W group. There were at least 6-7 moves which could be better, for both parts. Try to imagine several alternatives and you'ss see that the conclusion could be easily changed.]
