C[Hi,

i hereby request a review of this game for both players.
It has been played on DGS between erdmaennchen as W and jug[myself\] as B.
See: http://www.dragongoserver.net/game.php?gid=215760
Edited SGF with cgoban-2.6.12.

* I put some few questions in the game prefixed by 'JUG'.
* initially I was about 14k in rank, but during the weeks we played the game the rank increased, so it seemed a bit unfair, though in my opinion W had a better fuseki. You surely can point out our mistakes in choice of moves and joseki.
* please point out where we misjudged and what to concentrate on
* where can we improve ?

Thanks in advance for your effort of reviewing this game,
Kind regards, jug.

Review by Jadoube 4kyu IGS];B[pd]C[JUG: <c>Hi, have a good game</c>]
;W[qp]C[erdmaennchen: have a nice game..];B[dd];W[do];B[op]

(;W[pq]C[J: Seems far too passive by white and invites black to make a better position.

The two first white stones are not set out to follow this sort of strategy. A pincer seems called for.

 However if the idea is to take the  corner P3 seems better..]
;B[oq];W[pn];B[kq];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[qj];W[oj]SQ[nc][dq][hc]
C[J:  I'm unclear about the purpose of this move by white at this stage. It invites black to strengthen his position. There are so many alternatives to consider - see marks..]
;B[ph];W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[pc];W[ke]C[J: white established a setled position but in the process black got stronger both sides and has sente. 

P10 was the root of the trouble. After black's response white felt it urgent to stop black getting a huge framework.]
;B[cc];W[ci]
(;B[fp]C[J: I think black would have been better contesting the corner. This move invites white to take a big corner, which was the plan in the first place]
;W[dq];B[fq]C[J: This is a second weak move in a row by black. there is still room to invade behind these two stones, the gap to L3 is too large to ensure connection]

(;W[cl]C[J: I would start a fight by invading immediately]
(;B[ol]C[JUG: i think, this is not good. Where should B engage now instead ? W seems to have territorial advantage !?

J: As you say white is doing OK, mainly because of black's two por moves at F4/ F3. These threw away a good position.

This move is not good locally because of the gap at Q9. Also I don't see a good strategic reason for the move at this stage. 

Therefore there must be better for black. I've given many options. I like N18 best]

(;W[ql]C[J: I'm not too keen on this for white. It does make a nice safe corner but it invites black to form a high wall.]

(;B[pk];W[nn]C[J: Consider the varaition 2 moves ago. If white had played this first and black replied with Q9 would white rush to play R8? I think white would take sente to invade on the bottom.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[pm]
(;W[qm]C[J: P6 is the correct defence, it is important to keep access to the centre. Allowing black to seal the group in, and get a huge wall is a disaster strategically.]
;B[on];W[qn];B[ml]C[J: Black is back in the game - and ahead!]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[in];B[ho];W[io];B[kn]
(;W[hn]
(;B[go];W[jq];B[fm];W[jl];B[hq];W[jj]LB[fp:A]C[JUG: 'A' not alive yet (revealed later), but investing another move here ? So i think, handling the reduction was bad. What went wrong here ?


J: White is in fair shape to run away without this move - so immediately removing the chance for black to live would be best.

Of course if both playeers think the black group is alive then K10 is a good safe move.]
;B[jg]C[J: This move splitting two weak white groups is good by black.]
;W[nm]C[J: this seems very ambitous.];B[om];W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]
;B[ni]C[J: nice move by black]
(;W[lm];B[mm];W[ln];B[mn]

;B[hc];W[jc];B[ne];W[md]
(;B[lf]C[J: This makes a fair bit of territroy but look at the alternatives]
;W[ob]
(;B[pb]C[J: Keeps a big corner but its gote.

I think black should ignore this and play on the left.];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[er]C[JUG: ouch, B not alive yet, is there a way to make sure life (miai), is there a way W can kill or how to use it getting territory ?]

(;B[dn]C[J: i would take the chances to make at least one eye before anything else - simply because leaving it open runs the risk of no eyes on the bottom. 

Look at the variations];W[eo];B[gn];W[en]
(;B[em]C[J: Focus on the objective - which is to escape / make life D6 was a sacrifice stone]

(;W[dm];B[gk];W[gr]
(;B[gl]C[J: Not needed so far too slow - black is connected anyway.]
;W[ei];B[gi];W[ii];B[hh];W[ih];B[ig];W[hg]LB[jp:A]C[JUG: B cut, but W too and W 'A' also not alive yet (though shouldn't be a problem)

J: A is alive by capturing those 4 stones. Even if black saves them white can use the process to make life on the bottom.

So cutting is good in principle. But I don't think it gets white anywhere in this situation]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[gf];W[he];B[ge];W[kf]
(;B[kg]SQ[mp][dj][dl][dh]C[J: Black should sacrifice the 2 stones both white groups are alive so there are bigger moves. See marks]
;W[lg]C[J:  Black really didn't need to get into this - the danger is white will breeak through and eat up lots of that territory. The more black struggles to safe the three stones the worse it is likely to get.]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[mf];W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[of];W[me];B[nh];W[le]
;B[ki]C[J: In this sequence black lost about 10 points in gote - while trying to save the capture , which was worth 8 at best.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[cd];B[dc];W[oc];B[mp]
(;W[lp]C[J; Prudent to sacrifice the 3 stones and make life , see the variation]

;B[gh];W[gj];B[fj];W[hj];B[fi];W[hm];B[hk];W[gm];B[fn];W[ik]

(;B[ek]C[J:Black does not need to defend quite yet. K11 removes an eye opportunity, so does L8]
;W[hl]LB[kk:A]C[JUG: 'A' instead should give life, shouldn't it ?]
;B[kk];W[jk];B[ji];W[kl];B[im];W[ks];B[is];C[erdmaennchen: thanks for the game..

Result: B+Resign

JUG: what to improve on for both players ?



J: Since this game was played on Dragon both players should give more consideration to their moves. i know the temptation to play a quick move (i do it) but Dragon is a great opportunity to develop the  longer term strategic side of your game.

It is worth paying attention to wasted moves, unnecessarily reinforcing connections and so on.

It is always important to make sure your groups are alive before embarking on other activities.

Be more willing to lose/sacrifice unimportant stones

Think more in terms of exchanges - the game is about having more points than the opponent, not about getting as many poits as you can. Sometimes rather than fighting a losing battle it is better to accept a loss and take revenge elsewhere]
