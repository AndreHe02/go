;B[qh];W[ph];B[pi];W[pg];B[qj];W[qd]C[White o16 instead is better I think because the upper side
is the only place left to play big moves in.];B[qc];W[rc];B[pc]
;W[re];B[md];W[qp]C[i succeeded to destroy the right side with this, but i got an unsettled
group which was quite a problem afterwards

should i have played r4 before the r14 ... exchange, or should i simply have
left
the aji? I usually feel, that black gets a very big corner with this joseki
(even with q6 instead of q7), maybe that's why i was kind of determined to play
here.

Magnus: First of all, it is not urgent to invade the corner, sice if black adds a move to the stones in the lower right they will become overconcentrated. Perhaps a calm move at G17 or H17 is good enough with no risk.
Even the odd looking G16 is good idea to cancel Blacks plans to make a moyo from the K10 stone.]
;B[qq];W[po]C[MP: Strange shape];B[oo];W[qm];B[qo]C[It is hard to read this strange situation but perhaps,
the inner hane at R6 simply make the situation impossible for white.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[qn];B[rp];W[pl];B[om];W[qk]C[This is risky. My first idea here is to play white P9 and be prepared to sacrifice four stones if black cuts at R8. That would be a very small loss since the black corner group is 100% alive but the black group around Q11 is potentially weak.]

(;B[rk]C[I wonder if White would survive P9?];W[ol]C[It is better shape to play P9 here because it protect against the atari with Black Q9 (which would force White to connect because it threatens to connect all black stones - no sacrifice is possible)]
;B[rl];W[ql]C[Black has helped white. Now Black O8 is not as effective as before.]
;B[mm]C[This is to close to blacks own solid stones.  Black is thick and can play N8 instead.]
;W[nk]C[Playing N8 is perahps a faster way to get into the center (play contact moves against strong enemy stones and force them into overconcentration).]
;B[ni];W[lk];B[li];W[kl];B[kn];W[lm];B[ln];W[mn];B[nn]
(;W[il]C[Of course, i thought about playing n5. But i chose j8 to get out ahead.
What do you think?

Magnus: It would be dangerous to play N5 because black may play K8 (see variation). J8 is a good point because if black play there it will expand the black influence in the center.]

(;W[gn]C[this will help me connect the groups, but black gets a huge corner

magnus: since this is very bad shape (empty triangle) there has to be better moves. H17 looks is better locally but has the same strategic value. The best move is probably to play g2 capturing the three black stone as fast as possible leaving less forcing moves to black.]

;B[do];W[cg];B[el];W[jd]C[this was too far, i think ... i dreamed of attacking the black q17 group,
but that wasn't so reasonable ...

Magnus: if you dream of attacking a group like this you have to play L17]
;B[hc];W[kc]C[Now it looks like if you had started with L17 anyway!]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[he];W[mc];B[nc];W[ld];B[mb];W[me];B[lc];W[ke]
C[Forcing with O16 first is good style and would help White a lot in a fight to connect to the right.]
;B[of];W[nd]C[Black should probably play O15 to make use of white mistake in move order.]
;B[mc];W[mh];B[mi];W[nh]C[Now it is difficult to see what the urgent moves are. there are lot of slightly  weak groups in the center now. White could consider moves like J14, K13, K12 to counterattack and make eyeshape simultaneously.]

C[Aji keshi which lead nowhere];B[oj];W[rj];B[qi];W[fd]C[f17 better?

magnus: The moves here locally are K18 and E18. Your move and the alternative looks like they just make black stronger Without gain for white.]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[ic];W[dk]C[The maneuver on the upper side is meaningless unless White play E16 or J16 now.

Otherwise this is a good move.];B[id];W[dl];B[ek]C[This move help white to play a good point.]
;W[dj];B[ci]C[This is a case where black should not have forced before defending. The black move contradict themselves and white just need to follow along.]
;W[em]C[White has found a new set of two completely unimportant stones to attack...

D11  is the *only* move.];B[fm]C[If black want to be consistent with saving C10 this was the chance.]
;W[fl]C[D11 Is the only move];B[ed];W[cn];B[co];W[bo]C[A move in the center has to be more urgent.]
;B[di]C[A move in the center... but black should play B4 since the  B5-B4-exchange is not a loss to him and if White then plays B6 black can ignore that without any risk to the corner.]
;W[ei]C[White should play C4 or something, which at least threaten to kill Black outright before answering black.]

;B[oi]C[Black lives and the white stone at P12 is wort just half (eliminate a ko) an unnecessary connection with no territory. It would had been much better to have that move played in the center.]

C[In order to Improve white has to think more about which groups are strong and which are weak, and do not just follow the "normal move sequences". Both players in this game sometimes attacks and defends unimportant stones of low value.   Also remember to not play close to your own thickness, try to force your opponent to play moves close to your own thickness. Not becuase you want to kill, but because your opponent cannot get territory from such moves while your attacking moves elsewhere gives you either stronger groups, influence,  territory or all of this simultaneously.

Go through the game with these thoughts and try hard to rethink the value of those moves that violates these principles.

My best wishes

(;W[gr]C[magnus: this is your variation but this is the move I recommend as well but our conclusions differ in the end of the variation.]
;B[gn];W[hr];B[hn];W[fn]C[Cutting here is not urgent since the two black stones are meaningless. White should defend the big group in the center instead.]
;B[fm];W[en];B[gm]C[now i have the corner, but my group is unsettled ...

magnus:  yes but that is because you thought you had to cut off two rather meaningless stones.]
