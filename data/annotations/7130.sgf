Komi = 6.5 reverse for black

samtregar: Hello Corey, I'll be reviewing your game today.  This is somewhat of a challenging game to review - you were way overmatched here and it's hard to imagine how you could have won this game!  I'll try to point out some areas where you could usefully improve.  I will say that you seem to be much stronger than 20k, even if you're not ready to play a 6k even yet.  My comments will be prefixed by "s:".

samtregar: Please feel free to email me with questions about the review.  Also, keep in mind I'm only around 4k myself, so there are lots of things I don't know!]
;B[qo]LB[pp:A][qp:B][pq:C][qq:D]C[s: I don't like this move for an opening.  Moves at A, B, C or D are MUCH more common, and there's a good reason - they're closer to the corner and the corner is very valuable territory.

One way this works is if you plan to play at C later, which forms a very common shape that has a fancy Japanese name I can't recall.  But if you were going to do that, why not play at C to start and have better defense?]
;W[dd];B[co]C[s: Ouch, it gets worse!  You stones just don't seem to be working together here - they're both floating away from the corner, staring into a very large open area between them.]
;W[pd];B[pf]C[This I wasn't quite sure on, it felt like I should have played closer R5

s: This isn't bad - it puts preasure on white and has good influence being on the fourth line.]
;W[pj]C[s: Good move from white - he aims to split your stones apart and attack the weaker group.]
;B[ok]LB[nf:B][ql:A]C[s: I really don't like this - it's too far from R5 to provide support.  It mostly just begs white to cut off your Q14 stone.  I think R8 would be pretty good, or maybe O14 - white would likely respond with O16 and you'd build some power to attack Q10.]
;W[qg];B[oh]LB[qf:A][oj:B]C[Looking back, I didn't like this move, P10 probably would have been better at this time.

s: It's not so bad - white threatened to cross under at A, so you threaten to go over the top at B.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[nj];B[mm]TR[ok][pk]C[This also seemed bad, I should have extended at O9 first it seems

s: I agree, not a great move.  It's too far from the marked group to help, too far from the side or corner to make territory, too far from White to apply preasure.  It's basically a completely wasted move.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[ne]C[s: Great move from white - it serves two purposes, it attacks your stones while expanding white's potential territory.]
;B[ee]LB[cc:C][fc:B][cf:A][mh:D]TR[pf][oh]C[This was probably way too early, and too close to his stone

s: Yeah, not a great move.  If you want to attack the corner the moves around A, B or C are so much better.  White is basically free to ignore this move - it's no threat to him.

Also, what about your marked stones?  White has them almost surrounded!  Have you given up on them?  They're not huge, but not small either.  If you want to save them you have to run now around D.]
;W[ed];B[dj]C[s: I like this - it's a big area and it works well with your stone below.]
;W[de]LB[cf:A]C[s: Terrible move from white. Sure this makes profit in the corner, but it's very innefficient.  Even A would be much better.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[df];B[di];W[eg];B[dh];W[dq]
TR[co]C[This I really wasn't sure how to respond to

s: Yes, this is why your marked stone is in a bad place.  This is a perfectly reasonable place for white to play - this is not your territory since you're too far away.]

(;B[dp]LB[cp:A][dp:B]
(;W[fp]LB[fp:B][kp:A]
(;B[kp]LB[jp:A][kp:B];W[iq];B[kr]C[I don't know why I chose this, even then I knew L3 was probably the safer move]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[pq]C[s: Again white takes advantage of your choice of starting moves...]
;B[nq];W[po];B[qq];W[qp]
(;B[rq]LB[rp:A]C[s: Odd choice - usually you'd play A here, and then pick a side to reinforce after white connects.]
;W[rp];B[ro]C[s: this is called a "thank you move".  White should say "thank you" after you play it since you're forcing him to play where he wants to play.]
;W[sp];B[so]
(;W[pr]LB[ho:A][pr:B];B[ho]LB[io:A]C[s: This is a decent idea, but it's a stone too far.  A would be better in this area.]
;W[io];B[jn]C[I think this was just another situation when I didn't realize white would probably extend and split me apart.

s: White is following the best advice I've ever gotten about Go - split your opponents stones apart, keep your stones connected.]
;W[in];B[fn];W[hp];B[hn];W[qe]LB[mh:A]C[s: Odd move.  Pretty small really - the move around this neighborhood is A, completely killing your stones.]
;B[li]LB[mh:A]TR[nj][oj][pj][qk]C[This move, I had a question on. I was later told that this was a really good move to have made, but I don't really understand why.

s: Your stones are almost surrounded, so running is the right thing to do.  This is a little more dynamic than my suggestion of A and also puts some nice preasure on white since you could end up surrounding the four marked stones on the right.]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[nh]
(;B[og]C[I'm not really too sure about this, or whether something like O11 would have been better

s: Yes, I think you have to play O11 here. If you can't find a way to connect out these stones are dead.]
;W[le];B[hd]LB[ic:A]C[s: When you play in a mostly empty area like this you need to be thinking about how you'll live - do you want to make some territory, or do you want to run out to the center?  In this case I think you'd want to try to make some territory and disrupt white's moyo.  It won't be too easy since white is strong nearby, but there's a lot of empty space below the fourth line.  I'd play around A - on the third line, which is the right place to play to make some territory.  Playing on the fourth line like you did is better for running.]
;W[gc];B[fe]C[s: Saving this one stone should be a very low priority for you - you won't lose much if you just let it go.]
;W[ff];B[he];W[jd];B[ge]LB[fd:A]TR[hd][he]C[s: This makes what's called an "empty triangle", the worst shape in go.  The triangle is the three marked stones, with the empty space inside.  Instead, to make a firm connection you should make the bamboo at A.]
;W[hg]
(;B[cq]LB[bq:A][cq:B]C[Someone pointed out afterward that this was a highly important point. I guess it's good that I played here, but I don't really understand the importance

s: It is - it's worth a lot of points and it's sentai because white has to respond or risk losing his whole group.]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[ep];B[eo];W[fr];B[dl]C[s: This is a very slow move. Instead you should be trying to find a way to save some of your endangered stones.  You've got vulnerable groups in many places...]
;W[pm];B[mk];W[nk];B[pl];W[rk];B[jj]C[s: This move falls under the category of "vague moves in the center."  In the middle game these can be attractive, and sometimes they're even decent moves.  Much more often though, moves along the edges are worth more.  Playing directly in the center like this should be pretty much your last option and you've still got plenty of fighting to do around the edges.]

C[Black resigns

s: I hope you've found my review helpful.  Honestly I think you'd learn more if you submitted a game between you and someone closer to your own level.  As far as general advice - play lots of games and read lots of reviews of games around your level and a little higher.  Mostly just play lots of games!  You'll improve fast.  I'd be willing to bet you're at least 15k already - this wasn't the game of a 20k.  Good luck.]
