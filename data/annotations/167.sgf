;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[pj]L[nq][oq][or]C[this is a bit greedy for black.  a is normal, of course.
if now white b, black must b, white a and i think white
gets the better of this exchange.];W[qj]L[oq]C[this is  going to help black. better to play
in the area that black *should* have played
in, (a, as in the previous comment).];B[qk]L[qi][pi]C[too greedy! much simpler to  make white live small
with a, if white r9, black b.  now black's upper
right corner is ideal.];W[pk];B[pl]C[black's direction of play  here is not right. instead of
building a big upper right corner, he is trying to kill
the white stones on the side that are pretty much un-killable.];W[ok];B
[ql]

the stone in a ladder. see variation...];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[oj];B[pi];W
[rm];B[rk]
(;W[on]C[too passive! white is worried about his own
weakness (as he should be) but he isn't
taking black's weakness into account. i like
the variation better...];B[nq]C[by getting both the strong position at q11
and this move (o3) black has come out ahead
on this side of the board.  white's center
thickness is less than what black gained
in the lower and upper right corners, and it
is reduced even more by the presence of o3.];W[ro]C[this is a large sente  (but not double sente)
endgame move.  that means it's *much* too
early to play now.];B[rp]L[jp]C[since it's too early for white to play  s5,
black should consider responding with an
extension around a instead.];W[sp]C[still too small.];B[sq];W[so];B[oi]
C[it's  good that black finally stopped
playing endgame moves, but i'm not sure
if this is the correct tenuki.  while big,
it has no effect on white, and it's not
reverse sente (a white play here would
have little effect on black).  i think
approaching one of white's corners would
be bigger.];W[kc]L[kd]C[high, at a would have a better relation with
white's center thickness.  but this might
be just a stylistic preference on my part.];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[dj]
;W[cl];B[hc]L[cq][cp][dq][id]C[this feels too early to me.  while it's a good
invasion, i think a - c3 would be a better
point now.  it's hard for white to decide which
side (b or c) to block.  it looks like b is
the honest direction for white, so black
ends up with more territory than white, which
means white probably won't have time to simply
re-enforce around d - j16 just yet.  also, even
if white does get a chance to re-enforce, black
e - c17 should at least get a ko for black, so
this white territory isn't as big as it looks.];W[hd];B[id];W[gc]C[white  seems to be abandoning his l17 stone.]
;B[he];W[gd];B[ic]C[at this point,  black should be able to coast to a win.]
;W[bf]C[too small, and wrong  direction.  the stone at
l17 is the one who needs help.];B[kg]L[ke]C[this is a bit greedy for black. a -  l15 looks
like a more honest way to pressure white here.];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[nc]
;W[mc];B[lb]L[md][ld][lc][kd][jb][mi]C[black's move at q18 made  the statement that black
will exchange the corner for white's life on the
upper side. (if he wants the upper side, he should
force white to live in the corner by playing o18
instead of q18).  but now black m18 is saying that
black expects to kill white entirely! this is not
reasonable.  better to block on the outside with a,
white m18, black b white c, black c, white e.  then
black gets sente to enlarge around f.];W[mb];B[kb];W[me];B[nd]C[bad shape!   you should only play an empty
triangle when there is *no* other choice!];W[ne]C[white takes advantage of  black's bad shape.]
;B[pd]C[better to just play this directly (instead
of exchanging o16 for o15).];W[mg];B[li]L[lh]C[
 stl 5k*: is entering byo-yomi

reid: a here (instead of m11) would seal white in.];W[lh];B[mi]L[kh]
C[this seems to be the wrong direction.  black's
q10 group is alive and strong, while the j16
group is looking a bit weak.  a - l12 is the
right direction.];W[kh];B[jj]L[ig]C[again, wrong direction. something  around  a is more appropriate, i think.]
;W[jg];B[kf];W[ih];B[ji];W[jh]C[since the j16  group is still weak, and
k10 isn't in any danger, the exchange of
k11 for k12 is aji keshi.  better to leave
it for later.  (it might come in handy for
rescuing the black stones on the other side).];B[je];W[le];B[hi]L[gf]
C[black is still playing in the
wrong direction.  simply pulling
out at a and tying his weak groups
together leaves the burden on white.
as white pulls out his j12 stones,
black can build strength in the center
that will let him attack the p6 group.];W[gg]C[all of a sudden, the attackee  becomes
the attacker!];B[gf];W[fg];B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[lc];B[jb];W[if];B[ie];W[ei]

has one eye.];W[rn];B[rr]L[rq]C[if black wants to try to kill white, he
should play on the outside instead. after
all, white can't get any eyes by taking
the corner with a - s3.];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[hq]L[qm]C[if black  had played a r7 instead of t6, white
