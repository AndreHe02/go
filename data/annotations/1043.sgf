;B[pd];W[dq];B[jr]C[Ann, this move is quite extrange. Theory says: first corners, then extensions...

So, first play the next corner.

Also, K2 is very low ¿what was your intention?];W[dc];B[qp]
C[If k2 where k3, then the result would be fine. Any way, first the corner: it's the place where it's easier to enclose territory.]
;W[pj];B[ph];W[pm];B[pn]C[Contact moves (in general) are for defense purposes. To attack, avoid touching the enemy.

I prefer P5. It attacks, but mostly encloses territory for black.

You'll see contact moves tend to reinforce the opponent.];W[qn]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[om];W[rm];B[qo];W[pl];B[rn]C[This move is not really necesary: white can ignore it, and you don't lose too much if left unplayed.]
;W[qm];B[oo]C[Good.

Now: K5 or so look big points.

You must use your wall to your advantage; or to map *big* territory, or to attack the enemy.]
;W[ri]C[White is looking for breathing space];B[rh];W[dj]C[Very BIG point.]
;B[jd]C[Good again.];W[hc];B[he]C[This move I find dubious. While it reduces de potential of white left side, this side is still very open to invasion.

Invading it (C5, C15, C12... depending on your taste), or reinforcing your moyos (K5, O17), I think are better moves]
;W[gd];B[ok]C[Are you trying to kill white? If so, there's no point, at least not now.

This move is not urgent.];W[pk]C[Fortunately, white answers every move :)]
;B[ol]C[Now your moyo-to-be is bigger than ever, don't forget to use it.

A very ambitious way could be playing E4 and then making a wall while reducing white's left side.]
;W[mc]C[See var on next move for example of mapping moyo below]

(;B[md]C[Good to keep connected your stones, but you make life easy for white

Anyway, I like this move.];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb]
(;B[mb]C[Why not O17 to finish soon? (see var)];W[nc];B[oc]
;W[nb];B[nd];W[jc];B[ob];W[ma];B[kc];W[jb]C[No need, better J17]
;B[fp]C[Good.];W[fq];B[gq];W[eq];B[go]C[Nice shape. Only "problem" is that you're allowing white too much left side space.]
;W[dn]C[Very good.];B[en]C[Same thing about attacks and contact moves.]
;W[dl];B[mg]C[Good, but...

F8 or so are much bigger. If you're worried about White M16 o L16, just think you can forget this two stones, they're just 4 points...]
;W[df]C[White's left side is growing solidly... time to invade scapes... Now you must make the most of your moyos]
;B[lp]C[Overconcetrated. You don't need to play inside... white should not live there.]
;W[ro]C[This is a calm defending move. I'm not sure if it's necessary to live, but anyway it's good for relaxing :)]
;B[rp];W[sn]C[Now white is alive];B[qi];W[sp]C[This I don't understand, and is the kind of moves you should learn not to answer.

The points at stake are very few, and there are very big moves yet to be played. F9, even H12, K8...]
;B[sq];W[so];B[rj];W[rq];B[qq];W[sr];B[rr];W[sq];B[qs];W[rk]
;B[si];W[sk];B[qj]C[¿? What for?];W[qk];B[oi];W[oa];B[pa];W[na]
C[White is playing endgame moves (all this moves in the border of the board) too early.

He should reduce your bottom moyo - you should grow it (F8..)]
;B[qb];W[gj]C[It's a pity he played here before you... imagine this G10 being a black stone... you could have left the previous moves unanswered, couldn't you?

Think, for example, in the value of R1. If you don't play it, W R2, B Q2, W S1, B Q1... ¿6 points difference?

Now, try to imagine the value of B G9, for example... I don't know exactly what this value is, but in the order of tens.

Most in this case, where you have two moyos to grow. If W attacks from below, you can grow the upper one, and viceversa...]
;B[fk];W[fj];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[ei];B[fi];W[gi];B[fh];W[eh]
;B[gg];W[gk];B[el];W[dm];B[em]C[You've cut W. Now, you can make two things:

a) Kill him (try to) and risk everything on it
b) Press him, letting him live but making territory while pressing

The election should depend on the numbers... if you can allow him to live and still win, it's more easy. If you need to kill to win, then attack!]
;W[ji];B[kk]C[Good direction, but attack more... J9... all you stones are "at home", so don't worry.]
;W[gh];B[fg];W[jk]C[See? Now he has more space];B[ki];W[kj]
;B[lk];W[li];B[kh];W[lj];B[ig];W[ih];B[jh];W[ii];B[hg];W[hh]
