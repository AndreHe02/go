AB[dp][pd]C[In general, game ended qiute early in life and death problem. you have to place more value on idea of group just goiing out. Other thing is that you can, and you have to, give your opponent something, but just make sure you get 1 point more in the end.

In fuseki, think about what is what you want, and what you can give to your opponent.

also, if you make jump, remember that then it is your usually your opponents right to have some forcing moves there.

if you play on second line early, make sure that it is eather cut that really matters, or unconditional life, or takes life from your opponent group(or makes it uncertain), usually otherwise wait other moment for those.

There is some sequences I added, commented some of those, you might want to think about those little bit.
