C[HQ : I've reviewed this game.

This is an very interesting fighting game.
There are a few shape problems but mainly,
black weakness is a direction problem.
At many times, he played small matters without considering big points.

Black made a big mistake at the end of the game and lost.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[jp]C[HQ : Cannot be bad (Big point and splitting play) but this move doesn't give me a goog feeling. Because this move is high, it may be correct.

After a NirenSei (D16 R16 formation), the normal way to proceed is to make a moyo contest, for example

1. K16 : SanRaSei (a little bit out of fashion but  very tough)

2. E4 : with the idea of playing Nadare (avalanche)

3. Big points at D10 or Q10 (same idea as K4 but more moyo making.]
;W[gp]C[HQ : Feel good but many other moves are possible : K16 or D10 or C14.]
;B[nq];W[cf]C[HQ :  Ok, Q4 can stabilize later.
R7 or R6 would have been good also.];B[fd]
(;W[di]C[HQ : Bad feeling : no need to be so strong at the top.   D15 is a light stone, easy to abandon. Play at D10 works better with your high stones C4-G4.   There is too much spave between C4 and D11, an invasion will be easy for black (Not now because the right side is more important but in the near future.]

(;B[ep]C[HQ : Very agressive. Locally, this move is an overplay but  dangerous. Globally, the right side is more important. Imagine a black play at R6. It would have been much more severe because white stone is alone there.

Black attack in white sphere of influence, not a good idea.  Locally, an invasion at D8 would be eaisier to handle.]
;W[dn]C[HQ  Correct. Yoiu take territory while attacking.];B[en]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dl];B[hn]C[HQ : White has taken good territory on the left
and his G4 stone has still a lot of life.]
(;W[fl]C[HQ : Blunder. This move has no meaning. Your just play a dame point. There is no territory in the center.
White D12 stone is facing black H6 stone so neither white no black can make anything in the center.

You have two options :
1. R6 or R7. With a solid corner, your escape with G4 will be easier.
2. J5 to escape NOW. but your Q4 will be in danger sooner or later in the process.]
;B[gm]C[HQ :  Overconcentration but black is confident because the exchange is in his favor. Black could ignore F8 to play R6.]
;W[gl]C[HQ : Very small.];B[hl]C[HQ : The G4 stone will soon be eaten from far.
Black is dooing well.];W[nd]C[HQ : Jalous. Play R6 first It's not good to have TWO weak stones at the same time.
Nevertheless, it's playable.];B[qg]C[HQ :  Not agressive enough, it's a pity to let white stabilize so quickly. R6 or L17 is better.]
;W[jd]C[HQ : Good, theese stones are very light so all the top becomes dame.]
;B[qn]C[HQ : Easy to see that R13 is too low now.
Nevertheless, black has a strong attack that will able him to kill G4 definitly.]
;W[np]C[HQ Good locally but your G4 stone is crying.];B[oq]
C[HQ : Overagressive.];W[op]C[HQ : Good. Only move.];B[mp]
(;W[mo]C[Too mild, see variation.];B[lp]C[HQ : very good for black]

(;W[pq]C[HQ : bad move,   LOCALLY
firts It's gote and second white does make neither clear life in the corner nor points.

GLOBALLY :  You should think to play E3 quicly.
The point is huge. It's not urgent-urgent because a black play at C3 will turn to be gote.
But now that black has closed the bottom territory, E3 becomes sente.]
;B[pk]C[HQ : Good..]
(;W[ff]C[HQ : You try to justify your F8-G8 stones but simply paying C17 is big also.]
;B[hd];W[hk]C[HQ : slow, the center is small.]
(;B[il]C[HQ : No good. Of course it's good shape but
C16 or C3 is bigger. Black can afford to let white exchange K8 for H7.]
;W[ik]C[HQ : If black answer, a bad move can become good.];B[jl]
;W[jk];B[lo]C[HQ : VERY SMALL because of white L7]
(;W[nn];B[mn];W[no];B[mm]
(;W[kl]C[HQ : Too early, too small.
BEWARE : THE CORNER IS NOT CLEARLY ALIVE
P2 AND R5 ARE URGENT];B[km]C[HQ : very small];W[hf]C[HQ : Good.]
