GC[Here are some notes for the reviewer. Firstly I'd like to point out, that the more covering the
review is, the better. I'm eager to get stronger, and I'm sure every tip will help.
By the way, I'm playing black and the match is from a recent KGS tournament.

Something about the first 45 moves:

I'm not 100% sure, but I think each
and every corner was some sort of joseki, at least to some degree. I'm not sure
since I didn't check from anywhere but I have a faint memory of reading those all
from somewhere. In any case would be great, even the most important, to know
what mistakes I made during these moves.

Midgame:

Some of my moves might be a little off since I think I lost track of what my goal was,
but nonetheless, the game went on. At some point, around move 92 or so, I thought
about resigning. Since my desperate attempt to get the middle group alive seemed to have
failed, I figured I wouldn't have much to do anymore. But since I got it alive (due to
a lucky mistake from the opponent, perhaps?), things looked a bit brighter.

Also, reflecting from the whole game, I think I'm suffering from the lack of sente in many places,
or my reading simply sucks and situations end up in gote.

Yose:

Tradiotionally I've sucked at yose. I end up making one or two big mistakes that, in most cases,
ruin the whole game. This time I didn't do any dramatic mistakes (I might be wrong, maybe the
opponent just didn't notice them? :P) but regardless, I feel i'm not really good at it.

Anyway, as you can see, the game ended in my defeat and I'd love to hear why :P
Would be great also to hear some suggestions after the review, of how and what I should
practice, and in what aspects I'm lacking the most.

I thank in advance for your time.]

(;W[cm]C[N: I don't think this was the right choice here, better to just play the "normal" way and take sente. This move can be good for W if he already has a strong position in the upper left corner, but that is not the case here.]

;B[nc];W[qi]
(;B[qe]TR[qm]C[N: I don't like this. It does close the corner more or less, but it also makes W stronger, making it harder to use the aji of the marked stone, which can always start causing trouble]
;W[pf];B[kc];W[be]C[Pate [6k\]: hmm i think we just followed through four different josekis there..

;B[ae];W[fo];B[ko]C[N: Here the order should be different, B should attack first and then W has to defend, not W defend and then B defend also :)]
;W[md];B[mc];W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[gm];W[oe]C[N: W is playing with fire...]

(;B[ho];W[hp];B[io]C[N: This sequence is a bit too nice on W, I think. You do build up thickness towards the center, but that is not worth a lot here since W has influence in the center too.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[no]C[N: now the aji of the R7 stone is pretty much gone. Also I would think about not answering this.]

(;B[mp];W[lm]
(;B[le]C[N: There is a proverb "don't peep where you can cut", which I think applies here. The W wall is not very strong yet. You are just asking W to make the wall stronger, but get not much useful in return.

Your move doesn't seem very well thought through :)

Let's estimate the score at this point (always a good idea):

Black:

upper left: 12 points
upper right: 20 points
lower right: 20 points
lower left: 6 points
total: 58 points

White: 
left side: 8 points
bottom: 5 points max.
right side: maybe 25 points
komi: 7.5
total: 43.5 points

So as far as solid territorry is concerned, B is ahead by about 15 points.

So all you really need to do is make sure W does not get more than 15 points more than B!

by the way the bottom was counted quite generously for W, B can attack there and enlarge his territorry while making W smaller, if not just kill him.

So overall I think your strategy of creating a weak group in the middle of W strong area is exactly what you should not do. Just quietly reduce W so he does not get too many points there while scoring some points in the middle yourself would be the best thing to do. (after attacking the bottom maybe)]
;W[ld];B[nd];W[ne];B[me]C[N: This does not work, W too strong.]

;W[ik];B[hl];W[ij]C[N: Now you are under pressure to make those stones live. W made perfect use of his wall.]

(;W[rm]C[N: There is a lot of aji left in upper right corner, very dangerous, I think.

No more comments about the endgame, nothing much more spectacular going on there.

You played a solid opening, but you gave away the control of the game in the center after B 69. Another missed opportunity was to attack the bottom white group more strongly, which I'm fairly certain could have been killed.]
