C[Numsgil: Hi, I'm 5k on KGS, and I'll review your game.  I've marked my own comments with 'N'.

Maere: Hi, and thank you for going over the game.
In this game, I think I allowed white to build a framework and turn it into territorry too easily. I probably made mistakes like missing good timing for making invasion or reduction moves, or not making those moves in the right place. It's hard for me to find out what whent wrong exactly, which is why I submitted the game for review. I added variations where I thought about alternatives when I went over the game on my own.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq];W[dj]C[Maere: Here I hesitated between approaching the top or extending from my corner enclosure. I decided the second, but perhaps the former would have made a somewhat easier game for me.

N: Either would be an acceptable move, since both sides are about equally wide.  Though, the right side has the benefit of expanding from two corners at the same time, so I would actually it.]
(;B[qj]TR[pj]C[N: Since you control both corners, I would play one higher at triangle instead.  Don't play low unless you have to.  This gives up a lot of central influence, and you're still not secure from invasions.]
;W[jc]C[Maere: Here I decided I had to disrupt white's plans on the top. On second thought, perhaps playing calmly on the bottom would have been better. I ended getting out of there in gote which allowed white to play first on the bottom.]
(;B[ec];W[ee]C[N: This is not a usual move for white, but it's not outright bad.]
(;B[hc]C[N: the two space jump isn't always appropriate.  White is strong all around you, so this isn't stable.  Jump in to the corner instead (see variation).]
;W[mc]
(;B[ie]C[Maere: Somehow I don't feel satisfied with this move. But I don't know what would have been better. Getting out was priority, and I was hoping to put some pressure on the whie stones on the right.

N: Simple rule: when you're attacking you make a knight's move like this.  When you're running, you make a one space jump.]
;W[gf]SQ[ld][kd][ke][je][ie][if][hf][md][mc]C[N: White has the right idea: build up the left side while attacking you ever so slightly.  You have to respond, because you're behind this square line.]
(;B[je]C[Maere: On second thought, this is probably too slow.

N: Yes, but only slightly.]
(;W[jq]
(;B[gq]C[N: Be careful now: your group on the top isn't 100% alive yet.  You're creating a second weak group.  If white is competent, he will destroy you as you try and scramble to save two weak groups at once.

Invading everywhere that looks possible is a kyu level mistake that haunts most people up through even the high SDKs.  The sooner you stop it, the stronger you'll be.

Because of all this, I'd invade at the 3-3 point.];W[fp];B[cq]
SQ[gq]C[N: You're abandoniong your stone at square.  Since you _just_ played it, this is almost certainly a mistake.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dr]C[N: Weird move.];W[mq]
(;B[ih]C[N: You're still in danger of being cut in two, but yeah, something up here might be good timing.]
;W[hi]
(;B[pc]SQ[hi]C[N: No, don't ignore contact moves like square.  You can greatly reduce his moyo if you make a move at triangle.  And he has to respond anyway.]
;W[ob];B[me]C[N:  Good, yes.  Contain white.  Force him to make life, and build up outside thickness to secure one side of your moyo.  You should end in sente.]
;W[pb];B[qb]C[N: Yes, very important.];W[ii]C[N: Big more for white.  It was sente for either side.]
;B[gn]SQ[jh][ji]TR[kc]C[N: No.  You need to either make a move at square or punish white on the top with a move at triangle.  Both are urgent.]
(;W[en];B[gl];W[fk];B[fl];W[el];B[fq];W[gp];B[im];W[kn];B[jl]
C[N: Yes, this is the fastest way out, even though it looks slow.]
;W[nn];B[ll];W[pm];B[oj];W[nl];B[qm]
(;W[mm]C[N: White is playing a bit silly right here.  But notice: because of your invasion, you are having to give white moves which destroy any potential moyo you had on the right.]
;B[mk];W[eq];B[er];W[bq];B[br];W[dq];B[cr]C[N: This is an end game move.  Better to take sente.]
;W[bp];B[iq];W[jp];B[ir];W[jr];B[np];W[mp];B[on]C[N: Thi is smaller than it looks.]
;W[om];B[pn];W[ki]C[N: Oops, white cut you in two.];B[mi];W[jh]

(;B[ed]SQ[ei][fh][gg][hf][ie][jd]C[Maere: In the game, I considered playing higher, which would have been more of a reducing move, but decided for the third line. Not sure what is best.

N: This is not a reducing move, because you're way way way inside white's moyo (the line of squares represent places that could be considered reducing moves.  Reducing moves means you can make your move in sente, ignoring white's response, because you can still run out to your own stones for safety.  That's not the case here.

Since you're invading, I prefer your lower play at E17.  It's easier to make life on the edge if you're on the third line.]
