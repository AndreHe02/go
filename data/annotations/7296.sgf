C[Hi,

My name is Peter.
On KGS my nick is go4fun.
Please feel free to ask me 'online', if you see me there.
I will do my very best.
But keep in mind, that I am only a few stones better than you. So take my comments as advice, not as the truth.

I prefix my comments with g4.

;W[pd];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc]C[g4: Too small. White will ignore this.]
;W[rb]C[g4: Ok, he will give you a chance.];B[qd];W[pb]
(;B[qi]C[g4: Q15 is the shape move. White has nearly to answer.(see var)]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq]C[g4: The jump to F3 is normal]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[cg];B[ci]C[g4: Perhaps J17 is simpler. Black will live at the top for sure, but white doesn't has such a splitting move at the bottom. Black G2 is sente.]
;W[nq];B[kq];W[qn];B[oo];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[np]C[g4: Unnecessary. White can't move with this stone now.Black should press white down at the side with Q7, expanding his moyo.]
;W[mq]C[g4: Adding a dead stone to a dead group.];B[mp];W[lq]
;B[kp]C[g4: Good!];W[lp];B[lo];W[kr];B[jr];W[lr];B[jo];W[gr]
;B[hr];W[hq];B[hp]C[g4: What a pity. Simply playing J3 connecting all black stones and then F5 or G5 to protect the 2 stones leaves no room for white maneuvers.]
;W[ir]C[g4: ?];B[iq];W[or];B[pr];W[ns];B[mr];W[qr];B[ps];W[qk]
C[g4: Up to here black has already a won game.];B[ql]C[g4: There are bigger moves on the board, J17 for example.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[rn];W[ro];B[pn];W[qo];B[rk]
(;W[rm]C[g4: Wrong direction. Better at S8. (see var)];B[rl]
;W[sn];B[pk]C[g4: An ideal result for black.];W[ok];B[pj];W[nl]
;B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[ll];B[jl];W[mj];B[cc]C[g4: Risky, white will get a wall facing his weak stones giving them support. But black is leading by a wide margin.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bd]
;W[jd];B[ei];W[hl]C[g4: This can't work but white has to try.]
;B[ik]
(;W[hk]C[g4: In such situations it is often easier to play the small knight's move, eventually scrificing one stone. (see var)]
;B[hj];W[il];B[ij];W[jm]
(;B[kl]C[g4: Oh no. Don't let them connect. When they are connected, they will be a lot stronger. L7 is a must. (sse var)]
;W[km];B[im];W[hm]C[g4: White J6 seems appropriate. But the evaluation , if someone hase to attack so strong must be based upon counting. When you are far behind this is OK.
So let's count.
Black: 
UL = 6points
RS = 19 points
BOT = 30 points
LS = 10 points = 65 safe points
plus the right side, which should by safe territory: 40 Points
White:
BL = 6 points
BR = 10 points
TR = 8 points = 24 safe points.
plus the beginning moyo, varying from 30 to 50 points.

Conclusion: If both get their moyos, which is difficult for white, white will loose. So the last chance he has to fight.]
;B[in];W[fk];B[jk]C[g4: Nothing to fear there. G11 is safe and enough.]
;W[gj]C[g4: Wrong, Should be at F11.];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[fj]
;B[gh];W[dk];B[ck]C[g4: White tries to live inside. You shoul play some forcing move to destroy his eye shape before it becomes a threat. For example F10 now. And then F7. White has no chance to break thru.]
;W[dj];B[di];W[cj];B[bj];W[dl];B[cm];W[fm]C[g4: Now ist a little more difficult.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[gl];W[dm];B[bn];W[fl]C[g4: Now white has managed to live, with a lot of help from black, but nethertheless black has still a won game.]
;B[eg]C[g4: Too cautious. Simply playing M14 to attack the white lone group is enough.
Keep in mind: When you are strong you should attack while taking territoty or destroying your opponents territory. M15 for example threatens the white group in the center and threatens an invasion on the upper side.
Another idea is to separate the white left group from the rest Then it has to make life for its own makeing your group stronger. H16 is a possibility for that.]
;W[ge];B[lg]C[g4: Right idea.];W[oj]C[g4: Now don't let him live as easy as before.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[nk]C[g4: Are you sure that works?];W[nj];B[mk]
;W[lk];B[nh];W[oh];B[pi];W[mh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[nf];B[og]
;W[of];B[pg];W[lf];B[me];W[le];B[md]C[g4: Should be at M12 first. White hs to answer.]
;W[lh];B[oe];W[kg]C[g4: White has managed to bring his second weak group to life. But black has a route into his moyo at the top now.

Black: 
UL = 6points
RS = 30 points
BOT = 30 points
LS = 10 points = 76 safe points
plus the right side, which should by safe territory: 40 Points
White:
BL = 6 points
BR = 10 points
TR = 8 points 
TOP = 20 points 
Center 10 points = 54 safe points.

So black has still a won game.];B[hd]C[g4: Depending on the evaluation this is too much, and it is not necessary.]
;W[he];B[id];W[ie];B[jc];W[kd]C[g4: No again. L17! Black can't break thru.]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[kb];W[ic]C[g4: No! K18!];B[jb];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[mc]C[g4: Now black has also got inroutes to whites territory. Game over. Black has won.]

g4: So black managed to win by a big margin. Also there were some mistakes, this is truely not a game which is recommended for reviewing.
If you advance with this style, you will improve fast.
