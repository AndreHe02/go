C[T: Thank you in advance for reviewing my game! =)

N: no thanks ;-)
It appears you panniced in the early game by the idea your opponent would make a territory. But instead of giving this territory to your opponent, you gave him superior thickness, this troubled you for the rest of the game.

N: I think P16 is certainly playable, maybe R17 is a bit more difficult and you might have chosen a different joseki, but i guess you played the one you knew best ;-)]

N: If you didn't want to give black territory, you shouldn't have played the joseki in the upper right.
In go you should be able to give your opponent some territory, as long as it is not too big, but you should never be fixated only on the territory of your opponent.]

N: not good, your group is too weak, attaching at A is for example very bad aji for you.]
