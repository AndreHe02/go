AB[pd][dp][pp]C[MM: Comments by Mike Malveaux, 11k KGS. This review was requested by White, but I'll remark on a few of Black's moves too.]
;W[dd];B[mc];W[cn];B[co]LB[eo:a][bo:b]
(;W[eo]TR[dn][bo]N[A: actual game]C[MM: I imagine White wants to confine Black to small life in the corner, and claim the center. That's a fine plan, but this is not the way because it's too easy for Black to cut at D6. If White resists with close-quarter fighting, it only makes Black stronger, which is often the case with close fighting. Here it's better to be patient, and make sure your own groups are strong before you attack. Try D6 yourself, which is a fairly normal response to Black's contact play. Or possibly try B5, and if Black B4, then D5 (go back one to see variation).]
;B[qj];W[fc];B[mq];W[fq];B[eq];W[do];B[cp];W[er]TR[fp]C[MM: This seems too aggressive. Black's stones are not weak; White should not be able to kill the corner. This move leaves a cutting point that Black can exploit. So, why play on the 2nd line this early in the game? Better to just connect with F4.]
;B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[es]TR[ic][cd][bn][dj][jq][qf][qn][cj][jp]
[pn][pf][jc][cf][cc]C[MM: Loses sente, and is worth only a few points anyway. If you feel you must play here, F2 is better, because then Black at D1 does not require your immediate response. So, White would be free to take bigger points elsewhere (some ideas marked).]
;B[ds];W[fr];B[cj]C[MM: Ouch! That's a good spot, and White could have had it, if not so worried about 3 or 4 points on the lower side.]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[dg];B[dh];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[qm];W[jo]TR[bn]
[ej]C[MM: A big move. Still, the White stones are strong enough to live without this; and this K5 does not threaten Black. B6 would be better, because it is sente (Black must answer or risk losing the corner); after which, Black should probably attack the group on the left some more, from a distance. The goal is not necessarily to kill, though it's nice if you manage that; but rather, to use the threat of killing to make good walls and keep Black confined to a small group. "Make profit while attacking."]
;B[qg]C[MM: Black is well connected across the right side now, and playing rather calmly for a nominal 30k.]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[qc]TR[bn][ek][ol]C[MM: It's good not to respond reflexively at K18. However, I would leave this invasion until later, for these reasons: This stone is isolated from your other stones. Black will get strong attacking you, and that strength will affect the rest of the board; but White will spend 10 or 12 stones making a small, isolated life. Black has two 3-3 points open; so even if Black defends one of them, the other is available for the invasion.

Keep in mind that eventually you will need to cover your opening at K18, or Black's monkey jump will hurt. If possible, you want to do it in sente, so that when you defend there, it also threatens to attack.

Right now, the center is the biggest unclaimed area. How about first extending at B6 (threatens the lower left corner); then continuing the attack on the left; then jumping toward the right, both claiming some center and threatening a side invasion? (triangles)]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[se];B[sf]LB[rd:a][rb:b][pb:c]

(;W[rd]N[a: actual game]C[MM: This is a tricky position for White. It looks like it could die of the "bulky five" shape. S18 (b) or Q18 (c) instead would guarantee life for White, though sacrificing two stones at S15-T15 (go back for variations).]
;B[oe]TR[pe]SQ[pb][qb][rb]N[actual game]C[MM: This defends Black's weak spot at Q15. A good idea. Perhaps not necessary yet, but I guess it's sente, since White must answer or risk losing the corner.

I was curious whether Black could kill the corner by instead playing one of the points marked with a square. The fighting gets complicated, so I won't list the variations here. In most variations, Black killed White or forced a ko. In one variation, White was able to live in seki. In another, White might have been able to live by cutting at Q15 and running into the center for the second eye (but in doing so, White helped Black become very strong on the top and right); so maybe it's good for Black to first prevent the cut.

The point is that I don't think White can afford 41 at S16; in fact, the whole 3-3 invasion seems to be too soon.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[oa];W[qb]C[MM: White lived and secured 8 points, and deprived Black of about 12 more (points occupied by White or Black stones, which would not have been occupied without the invasion). Net difference in score is + 20 points for White -- 2.5 points per stone played.  Not so good, this early in the game!

This result is better for Black than for White, because Black became dominant across the right side and facing the center; and White is still open at K18. If White had claimed the center before invading here, then the strength Black builds fighting for the corner would have less effect on the rest of the board (because more of it would be settled already). The 3-3 invasion was a little too early.]
;B[nc]TR[cl][kd][fh][dl][kj][ki][jj][ji][qq][nn][nm][ib][eg]
[dn]C[MM: Too defensive; White cannot cut at P17. Better for Black to play one of the points marked.]
;W[jb];B[qq];W[bo];B[bp];W[ao]TR[bn]C[MM: Better at B6 to keep sente.]
;B[ap];W[bn];B[bl]LB[cl:a][br:b]TR[dn]C[MM: Black 56 at B8 is interesting. It creates a base for Black, and simultaneously deprives White of the opportunity to make a base there. Now the cut at D6 (triangle) may be severe.

Extra credit: What happens if White attacks at B2? When would be the right time for such an attack?]

(;W[cl]TR[ji][lf][el][dm]CR[dn]C[MM: Though White can probably live with B9, this does not stop the cut at D6 (circle). Instead of having one big connected group, White would have two smaller groups. Instead, try a "tiger's mouth," or a shicho stopper near one of the triangled points.]
N[a: actual game];B[ck];W[cm]TR[dl]C[MM: Why not at D8 instead?]
;B[dj]TR[fk][el]C[MM: This does make some eye shape for Black, but it feels small. How about one of the marked points instead?]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[fh];B[ej]TR[em][nn][ng][oj][lj]C[MM: Unnecessary, and too small.]
;W[el]TR[cm][dl]C[MM: Good defensive move, protects the cut at D6, and makes a few points of territory. White could have accomplished the same effect with fewer stones by putting move 59 at E8 (triangles).]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[fi];W[gi];B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[cf];B[gh];W[gg]

(;W[ec]TR[jf][ii][hk][ji][lo][lp][gk]LB[ih:b]N[a: actual game]
C[MM: Slack. Those Black stones have no chance, so there's no need for White to spend another move capturing them. This does help protect against a 3-3 invasion, but with White's strong stones around C14 etc., I don't think any additional protection there is needed right now.

The edges are mostly settled now; but the center is not, and at this stage, the center looks large. Try one of the triangled points instead. Perhaps best, catch three Blacks in a shicho with J12 (b; back for variation), connecting your stones and making White strong in the center.]
;B[mn];W[jl];B[mk]C[MM: Big moves, claiming territory. But, those extensions can be cut. A rule of thumb: on the third line, a two-space extension cannot be cut. On the fourth line and above, it can be cut (unless there are other supporting stones around).]
;W[oh]C[MM: That's the spirit! It might be one line too deep; I'm not sure.]
;B[mh];W[oj];B[ok];W[jh];B[me];W[gj]TR[gh][hh][hg]SQ[gk][hk]
C[MM:  ?  Your stones are connected to the top, because you can capture the three marked with a triangle. If you want to connect to the bottom, and seal Black in on the left, this is not the way to do it, because you invited Black to extend out at G9 -- which, as is often the case, is where you should play.  (Or at H9; marked with squares.)

If you played at H10 to atari a stone at F11 and perhaps capture one at F9, that's too small to win this game.]
;B[kf]LB[jf:a][nl:b]
(;W[jf]SQ[ig]TR[oj][oh]N[a: actual game]C[MM: Slack. Thanks to your 99 at K12, you can capture with J13 (square), therefore White doesn't need this. Instead, why don't you do something with your invading stones on the right (triangles)? Black is strong, but still has gaps you can attack. Even if you don't rescue the stones (thereby reducing Black's territory), if just the threat of rescue lets you contain Black more firmly and make more territory in the center, that would make the invasion a relative success.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[ka]SQ[kc]TR[br][gk][kq][lp]
[lm][ll][ln][kg][kj]C[MM: L17 (square) would be more usual, but this is still small compared to some of the other plays available (triangles).

Who is ahead now? Beginning players usually don't know, because counting the territories is hard. But like reading shicho, it becomes easier with practice. For tips on how to count more easily, there are resources on the web (try http://senseis.xmp.net/?EstimatingTheScore).

White upper left: about 54
White upper right: (+8) 62
White lower left: (+38, assuming White gets to play at G9)  about 100 total

Black upper right: about 42 (assuming Black kills P10-P12)
Black lower right: (+ about 56) 98
Black left: (+ about 8)  106
Black lower left: (+8, unless White gets B2) about 114 total

So, White seems to be about 14 points behind. That's not much. If you make the biggest plays first and maintain sente, you might make that up in the endgame. So if you think you can do that, you don't need to try risky tactics. On the other hand, if you're not confident of keeping sente, you might want to try something riskier in the hope of getting those 14 or 15 points.

Either way, there are much bigger plays available than L19 and L17.]
;B[la];W[ja];B[lb];W[kc]C[MM: Too small! That's only 1 point, and you need at least a dozen. Especially when you're not sure whether you're ahead or behind, look for the bigger points first.]
;B[lc];W[gk]C[MM: Good! Preventing Black's incursion is big. But, it's gote. Black doesn't have to defend anything as a result of that move. (Well, there is a double atari at F10, but that's only worth 3 or 4 points at most.) Try to play sente moves that have to be answered; after that, it's your turn, so you can then make your necessary defensive moves.]
;B[kk]TR[oh][oj]C[MM: See? Black feels L9 is more important than the double atari at F10, and I agree. This pretty much nails the coffin on P10-P12, and ends your chance of building a wall by threatening to rescue them.]
;W[jk]TR[kn]C[MM: See the power of a sente move? You had to answer. Now Black can defend at F10, or if possible, first find another sente move, perhaps L6.]
;B[kn]C[MM: I'm impressed. Black is doing well for a 30k.];W[fj]
;B[ei];W[ek];B[jn];W[in];B[ko];W[jm];B[km]TR[jp]C[MM: Pushing through at K4 looks bigger.]

;W[jj];B[nk];W[lh];B[kh]TR[lg]C[MM: Maybe safer for Black to play M13 instead, sacrifice one stone, and take sente.]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[mg]C[MM: Interesting. Because Black didn't sacrifice a stone, White might be able to make life on the right. I don't think there's quite enough room; if Black plays carefully, I think Black can restrict White to one eye.]
;B[jp];W[io];B[kq];W[ip];B[kp];W[ks]TR[nf][pf][pi][of]C[MM: Small, and not necessary. Instead, try to live on the right.]
;B[ls];W[js];B[lr]LB[iq:a][of:b]
(;W[iq]LB[ng:a][pi:b]N[a: actual game]C[MM: Not necessary; Black cannot cut. You can spend this stone somewhere else. Go back to see variation.]

;W[nh];B[og];W[ph];B[mf];W[ni];B[pg]TR[pi]C[MM: Misses another chance to kill (Q11).]

[lf]C[MM: Bad move. Doesn't make White safer (since White is already unconditionally alive); doesn't claim any territory; doesn't threaten Black; doesn't reduce Black's territory. Any of the triangled spots would be better, and probably enough to win.]
;B[ql];W[qi];B[rj]TR[ri]C[MM: Needlessly defensive. Why not play at S11 instead?]

(;W[ad]N[a: actual game]C[MM: Corner practice is good. Here, you are strong enough that you don't need to protect this stone. The main goal is to stop Black from living in the corner (back for variation).]

;B[gs];W[hp]C[MM: Handicap: 3; Komi: 0.5; Result: B+7.5

A close game. If White had gotten B2, White probably would have won by half a point. If White had gotten B19, White would have won by at least 4 or 5 points.

White needs to recognize such opportunities and take better advantage of them. Before moving, look around and try to see what's not yet settled. Unless you're in the middle of an important fight, a play in an unsettled area usually is worth more than adding stones to a group that is already settled.

This comes with experience, so play lots more games. I suggest mostly 9x9 games for a while, because that is the fastest way to get useful experience.

Working on tsumego problems helps a lot too, as the pros recommend. See http://www.goproblems.com/ and http://senseis.xmp.net/ for some problems to solve. Reading some material on tesuji will also help White improve quickly.

Thank you for the opportunity to review your game. Please write if you have any questions.
