AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello, my name is John (JFR).  Thank you for reviewing my game.

I lost by about 35 points in the end.  No groups were killed, although some were invaded and parts were cut off.

>From the settled groups that I made : I need help making them settled more efficiently and using them as a base to make more points in the center.

Thanks again for your review.

om3: Hello! My name is Daniel, or om3 (kgs-name) and  I will do my best to review your game. Since I'm only a bit stronger than you (3k), read my advise critically and try to get the best out of it!]
;W[qn]C[JFR [7k\]: hello !];B[nq];W[qi];B[jc];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[of]C[om3: Up to here, I like your Fuseki moves very much. You seem to make optimal use of your Handicap stones without provocing unnecessary complications.]
;W[og]
(;B[mf]C[om3: This is the first move I do not completely agree on. Not a mistake, but probably a slack one. Why jump when you're already ahead?
Alternatives are bend or plain stretch, or possibly even tenuki.]
;W[cf];B[ef];W[je]
(;B[ld]C[om3: Wrong direction. In this kind of situation, it's usually better to play towards the less strong stones. Since both sides are quite strong here, and the invasion is a bit deep, even a capping move may be considered.]
;W[fd]
(;B[gc]C[om3: Again, the direction looks strange to me. What does this move do except for very few points of territory on the top? However, it's not so easy to come up with a good alternative here...]
;W[ee];B[de];W[df]
(;B[ed]C[om3: I don't think, this forcing move helps you. In fact, it weakens e14. Better play f17 immediately!]
;W[fe];B[fc];W[hd];B[hc];W[cj];B[cl];W[ce]
(;B[bc]C[om3: The corner is of course not small, but here the move seems a bit slow, since it doesn't affect any groups live.]
;W[fg];B[eg]C[JFR: I added some paths for black's next move.  after looking at these sequences it seems that I should have explored this further.  do you agree?

om3: I'm not absolutely sure, since it gets quite tricke, but I think f14 captures b. B shouldn't play on here, until he is not absolutely sure that his stones will survive and he can get something out of it. Otherwise it's just strengthening w.]
;W[eh]
(;B[on];W[fq];B[dq]C[om3: Simple! I like that one.];W[iq]
(;B[pj]C[JFR: was this the wrong focus here?  Should I have taken L3 or cleared up a corner

om3: Yeah. Both looks better to me! Since there are neither weak groups nor large frameworks on the board, exchanging strength for territory looks like a bad deal here.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[qk]

(;B[co]C[om3: Very submissive. Is it really necessary?];W[cm]
C[om3: W just gets what he wants.];B[qp];W[lq]C[om3: Now, w has no trouble at all. Still the territory is quite balanced - but don't forget it's a handicap game!]

;B[jq];W[kp];B[ir];W[kq];B[jr];W[jm]C[JFR:  I feel that I have made good solid points from these past few moves in the bottom left.  Score Est says White is winning by 14.5 points now.  Is that true?  It's very hard for me to see that

om3: The last few moves are an interesting sequence, but I think they were not so very good for b. B took a limited amount of 4th line territory, but look how strong W has become. It will not be easy for b to reduce his centre!]
;B[nh]C[JFR: Looking at this now O13 looks better (at least as a play in this local area)

om3: Definintely, o13 is the local move to play];W[lh];B[mk]
;W[nj];B[mm];W[ll]C[om3: You continue to help w solidify his centre territory.]

;B[ie];W[hf];B[he];W[ge];B[id];W[hg];B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[ng]
C[JFR: O14 I should have played.  Now the score Est says black in up by 21 points.  If that is right then from here to the end that changes by 50 points.

om3: o14 looks clearly bigger than c16. This looses you about 10 points. The SE result is indeed funny, but I think the game could still be close, if b plays the endgame well.]

[ss]C[GoTour [3k\]: thank you
JFR [7k\]: thanks for the game
JFR [7k\]: did i have something there at the end
JFR [7k\]: ?
GoTour [3k\]: it was hard for me , but i think at the end you made no mistake


om3: To sum up: I think that the most crucial mistakes were: 

Some slack moves in the opening and early middlge game: 14, 16, 28, 36, 48. These made you loose your handicap advantage. The endgame mistakes 94, 119 and 148 then finally made you loose the game.

I suggest two things to improve. The one is in principle very easy to realize, the other not. The easy one is to remember to always play away from strong stones. Basically if you just followed this principle, you can easily avoid moves like 14, 16, 28... The second and harder one is to improve your reading, so as to gain more confidence in situations like they appeared in the endgame. Therefore it helps to solve tsumego.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this game. I hope, some of my comments will be helpful for you in your future games.

Have fun,
