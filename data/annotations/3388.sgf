C[Xris: Hi my name is Xris on IGS and KGS. If you have any further questions please go to IGS on channel 33. I am usually there(but only rarely on KGS im afraid). Also I will prefix my comments with "Xris: ". Last remark: If you have any questions about terminology I use please look on senseis library first: xmp.senseis.net Most is explained there and much more. If I say anything incomprehensible otherwise please contact me, by email or on IGS.]
;B[pp];W[qe]LB[pd:B][qd:A]C[Xris: From this opening for W there are many interesting joseki. But since it is not very common among weaker players it might be a better idea to start with a "simple" one first. Try A or B.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[jp]C[Xris: This a very common, and well researched fuseki. The general idea is that when white takes one side of the board you can easily fall back to the other.]
;W[dj]
(;B[nd]LB[qe:A]C[Xris: Bad move. Its too weak on white. Like this you are giving white deliberately the corner, which he is not supposed to get because of the opening white played. A suggests that white claims the side for him not the corner. Then black should get at least 15 pts in the corner.]
;W[pc]C[Xris: Good. Secure the corner.]
(;B[pg]C[Xris: Not good either. Black should create a base for living later on.]
;W[qg]
(;B[pj]C[Xris: see variations for some good alternatives to this move.]

(;W[od]C[Xris: THis is too small. It accomplishes nothing. It neither gets you more terretory, nor does it attack or take away terretory from ur opponent. Look at variations. I have supplied various alternatives.]

(;B[oe]C[Xris: Black doesnt even need to answer...];W[pe];B[kd]
;W[nc]C[Xris: Nice shape.];B[ne]
(;W[co]C[Xris: This is no good. Try to play further away.]
(;B[dq]C[Xris: Ah answer a bad move with another one?];W[cp]
;B[do];W[dn];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[ar]C[Xris: Hane is a mistake. But only a small one.]
;B[bp]SQ[jp]C[Xris: Later you are asking if white could have lived in there. I would say that even now its virtually impossible. You shouldnt let B get such a massively strong position towards the marked stone.]
;W[aq];B[ap];W[bo];B[as];W[ao]
(;B[bq]C[Xris: No necessary.];W[cn];B[go]C[Xris: Now black has a massive part of the board turned into his terretory. Now its already too late to invade in there. This should have happened earlier. But the game is far from being lost. White has to make up for the loss he has taken here now.]
;W[gn]C[Xris: Not good. this is bound to fail. Or at least not accomplish waht you want it to.]
;B[ho]C[Xris: ... since like this B can solidify.];W[hn];B[in]
;W[im];B[fn];W[io]C[Xris: Dont play atari unless it has a use.]
;B[jn];W[fm];B[hd]C[Xris: Black has taken another big point that should belong to white in order to make up for the loss in the bottom left.]

(;W[cc]C[Xris: Very very small move.];B[fo]C[Xris:  This protection is useless since black might loose 1  stone at most. B should have used this to secure some of his rather vague terretory.]
;W[em]C[Xris: necessary to avoid double atari. Well read!];B[fc]
C[Xris: Black takes another huge point.];W[eg]C[Xris: good.]
;B[ff];W[ef];B[fe]
(;W[ee]C[Xris: No necessary. What would have happened if B played there?]
;B[fh];W[eh]LB[lc:E][fg:G][ri:F][jj:D][qm:A][nq:C][qq:B]C[Xris:  Proverb: "Tenuki is always an option. I have marked some points which I like. All of these would have procued a black answer. If not then black would be in trouble bigtime, but your terretory on the left is still safe.]
;B[hg];W[ec];B[qn]
(;W[fb]C[Xris:  This is too small still. Now is basically your last chance to invade somewhere else on the board.]
;B[gc];W[ga]C[Xris: Your moves are getting smaller and smaller. First of all why didnt you just extend? Second, save these kind of moves for endgame. Its only wirth about 1 point.]
;B[gb];W[ea];B[ha];W[fa];B[ib]
(;W[hm]C[Xris: Since W is behind he should attack and not defend.]
;B[jm]C[Xris: This is HUGE for Black. This move is worth maybe 30 points.]
;W[gk]C[Xris:  Another defensive move which should have been an attack.]
;B[jk]C[Xris: And black takes even more];W[ik];B[ij];W[hj];B[ii]
;W[hi];B[hh]C[Xris: Now its too late for white to do anything about the centre terretory...]
;W[gi];B[gh];W[fi];B[il];W[hl];B[hk];W[dm];B[ik];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[ed]C[Xris: White shouldnt defend here. This is worth half a point if black captures.]
