C[hi reviewer.
I'm richard 12k, playing white.

Mainly I'm looking for direction advices.  But sometimes I wonder
about some sequence understanding.
thanks.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]C[averroes [?\]: why is the timer on 1 min?]
;B[qo];W[qj]LB[qm:A][qg:B]C[Is it a good shoot ?
I thought "A or B" are miai, so it is a good place to be.
was I wrong

RM: That makes sense to me. However with your 1st two stones
on the hoshi point I guess you want to play a center orientated
game. I think that d10 fits better with this strategy. Also you
should consider taking something at the lower side as if black
plays here his stones will be strong and efficient. So k4, k3
are good. If black's third move had been at q5 then moves in
the area of r10 would make sense since it would have good follow
up moves - you could make a base whilst looking under black's
stone(s).];B[cn]LB[fp:A][dn:C][dj:B]C[Arg ..  how to answer here ?
Obviously, 'A' looks to slow.
A pincer around 'b' (or closer?) but with what next ?
I couldn't visualise all possibilities.
This is why I chose the 'c' move, to face downer right position.
error ?

RM: Without white's previous move supporting this stone a difficult
choice arrises. If black gets to play on the lower side in sente
(say whilst attacking the corner position then it is likely black
will make a profit. So I think that white must try to make the
corner stronger. F3 and F4 are slow, but ok. D6 looks like it
should allow white to naturaly take the lower region.]
(;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[cj]
(;W[fp]C[RM K10 is a good place for white rather than F4. It stops black
from using the two stones to the right efficiently and gives
white a base. It will probably lead to a serious fight though,
so you really need to know the joseki (I don't). See variation:-]

(;B[kq]C[RM: A big place but gote. Black should take advantage of white's
weakness on the right hand side first, say with R13. See variation:-]

(;W[jd]C[I'm pretty happy to be able to get that place:
pincing black's oshi, instead of being pinced myself.
What do you think about that ?

RM: It is a good place, but black can pincer white's r10 stone
in sente, so white should approack q16 from the other side, keeping
sente, or at least the flexibility to attack the corner stone
later.];B[qg];W[qm]LB[oj:A]C[Yeap, the waited miai ...
is 'a' better ?  I guess I had to settle down before flying through
center ?

RM: Yes];B[cf]C[HA !
another big doubt !
What would you play regarding global position ?
I chose invasion attack to use my upper middle oshi.
what would be the bettter instead ?

RM: I think C16 or B16 are good here. They take the corner whilst
allowing the future reduction of the left hand side black group.]
;W[ch]C[RM: Too early. Attack from strength. Play c16 first, and leave
c12 (or similar) for later.]
(;B[cc]C[RM: I think black should jump out instead to e14.]
;W[dc]C[once again, I choose this side to face my middle side oshi stone]
;B[cd];W[de]C[building my wall, it's ok for me];B[bf];W[eh]
LB[eg:A]C[Arg ! I don't know any joseki here.
Would 'a' be better here ? Ore elsewhere ?

RM: e13 is the most common response.];B[bh];W[bi]C[ok, don't look there, misread ;-)]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[bj]
(;W[ko]LB[mq:C][om:A][nd:B]TR[ko]C[yes, this is _the_ point of that fuseki, and i'd like to understand
it ;-)
in fact I could play 'a' to avoid black's moyo.
But he would then play '^', increasing influence.
I could play around 'b'. But what then ? for what kind of purpose
?
So I chose white move, to shrink black's power and threaten 'c'
invasion.
What do you think ?

RM: The trouble with threatening 'c' is that black is solid in
the corner and can just cut through at m4. Even if the cut fails
then black can probably live at the bottom. So white should not
regard L5 as a forcing move at all.

RM: I think white should not be so jeolous, and instead calmly
exchange terratory.

RM: White j3 is a simple alternative. This really does make white
'c' a worry for black. o17 is a very big move also. See variation
...];B[mp]LB[lp:A]C[Isn't 'a' better ?

RM: They are both good responses.];W[iq]LB[ip:A]C[isn't 'a' better ?
what goal should I follow ?

RM: At this point white has made some influence toward the centre.
It may be possible to utilise this soon. But first the top should
be played as these lower stones are all light.];B[jp]C[RM: Top is biggest place now.]

(;W[jo];B[ip];W[hq];B[io];W[km]C[Well, he destroys my pseudo-moyo very easily ....
what should I have done instead ?

RM: You should leave the one or two stones (they are light) and
play the upper area. Later the influence in the center may be
important to enlarge the top or make terratory in the center.]
;B[im];W[nc]C[I guess it is not time yet ...
but what move instead?

RM: No the is big.];B[pc];W[ne]C[I'm happy to increase moyo. shouldn't I ?]
;B[ie]
(;W[ef]LB[id:A]C[was that move necessary ?
shouldn't I played 'a' instead ?
Or what else here ? What goal to follow ?

RM: I would play under black, there is a lot or terratory here.]
;B[id];W[jc];B[ig];W[gd]C[Is this white move a good idea ? I can't see what to play:
so i tried to defend my wall .... to slow/wrong direction I guess.
but where instead ?

RM: You must defend your wall, so this is the right kind of move.
Perhap G17 or h17 might be less prone to black peeking underneath]
;B[ic]
(;W[jj]LB[hc:A]C[aaaaah, didn't I miss somthg ?
isn't 'a' better to attack black's stick ?
(but how to use the attack then ?)

RM: if white plays h17 then black m14 and black can connect out
or make shape without too much difficulty.];B[je]LB[hc:A]C[I guess 'a' is still ok.

RM: I think k15 is too slow for black, better to skip out to
m14.];W[ld];B[jb]LB[kb:A]
(;W[lc]LB[kb:A]C['a' looks better there.  see variation but tell me if it is wrong
:)

RM: I prefer L18];B[gc];W[fc];B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[ke]LB[kb:A]
C[was 'a' better to stop border life ?

RM: Blacks group is too strong to try and attack now.];B[kb]
;W[lb];B[ge];W[fe]
(;B[hd]C[RM: Black G14 better. Black will make shape toward the center
that way.];W[kg]C[Here, I try to get some compensation,
but my center moyo is obviously to open :(

RM: Yes and more importantly it has a couple of weak groups and
is surrounded by solid black groups. With nothing to attack and
something to defend white cannot expect to make terratory here.]
;B[of];W[ph];B[qh];W[nn]C[Yes, I missed a move here :(];B[pi]
;W[oh]C[From now on, you will witness my main weakness:
not able to secure (or use) moyos.

I won't have any more question, and you could stop the review
here.
but you're welcome to give any advice if you whish to look at
the game till the end :)
