;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic];W[pj];B[dj];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd]
LB[ed:D][jp:C][qc:A][qh:B]C[JL: This is a bit questionable move. First, it takes away the invasion point on 'A' from white assuming black defendes. Second, there is no reason to play here as if black invades at 'B', white could jump 'A' in defence. A better idea would be to simply at 'C' or maybe something like 'D'.]
;B[qc]LB[ph:B][qh:A]C[JL: now it is hard for white to reduce this area of the board and also white has a problem at 'A' which needs to protected basicly now (by playing at 'B') or black will invade at 'A' and the two lone white stones will be in trouble. Had white not made the previous exchange, it'd be easy for white to escape to the corner when faced with such an invasion.]
;W[cm]MA[qf][rd]C[JL: the marked stones can now be attacked. Had white protected them, he'd made some territory and had solid and thick group. Now he may be in slight trouble as the marked stones are a bit too heavy.]
;B[iq]MA[dj]LB[jq:B][kq:C][qh:A]C[JL:I am not sure if the played move is as good as 'B' or 'C' - though 'A' might  be best now - or at least after this new black group has been settled. When settling the group black should be aware of the weak marked stone. Black want's to settle this bottom group in a way that will not give white strenght to attack the stone. Also black should settle this group in a way which doesn't make it easy for white to protect against invasion of 'A'.]
;W[mq]MA[iq]C[JL: White might want to play closer to the marked black stone, but still this move is locally ok. The only problem locally is that once black extends white can't hope to attack black any more because of the extra space between the marked black ston and the move white made.]
;B[fq];W[fp]MA[mq]LB[dq:A][er:B]C[JL: Simple 'A* is probably better, and if the marked stone were closer, then 'B' would look good.]
;B[gp]
(;W[fo]MA[dj]C[JL: this is maybe a bit illogical here. Usually you want to extend like this when you either have a position on the left hand side of the board or are about to build position there. Now the marked black stone erases much of the influence white builds. Of course now also white can consider attacking the marked stone, but it looks like black will get sente here and has time to remove the weakness and totaly erase the power of this group.]

(;B[go]C[JL: this is a bad move. Black should instead play according to the variation.]
;W[eq]C[JL: white punishes black.];B[fr];W[fn]LB[cq:B][dr:A]
C[JL: I am not sure of this move even though it is very thick. White has invested heavily in this area yet black can still play 'A' later, and depending on how the game goes, maybe even 'B'.  I would probably had simply blocked black's access to the corner and made lots of solid territory.]
;B[kq]MA[cm][dj][dp][eq][fn][fo][fp]LB[dg:A][io:C][qh:B]C[JL: black is playing too slow here. Instead I would probably had played around 'A' preparing for the invasion at 'B'. As the marked white stones are very strong now the marked black stone is very weak. This is why 'A' or something around it looks good - also it'd create a nice moyo (territorial framework) for black. Anyhow locally there is no attack white can harass black as black can play this or 'C' later if white tries to attack.]
;W[mo]LB[ph:A]C[JL: too slow and passive. This move has no severity whatsoever, nor does it take territory. The black stones are absolutely safe. White should have played at 'A'  as it would make lots of solid territory and more importantly would have made a solid white group.]
;B[qq]LB[dg:A][qh:B]C[JL: Wrong direction of play. It is more urgent to protect at 'A' aiming at invasion of 'B'.]
;W[qp]LB[dh:C][nr:A][qh:B]C[JL: black might want to consider a move like 'A' now, although more standard moves may be better in this position. One problem for black which is caused by this invasion is the fact that invading at 'B' will be more difficult now as white will become thick. Also white attack of 'C' is beginning to look really juicy.]
;B[pq];W[oq]
(;B[rp]C[JL: why not the usual move? See variation.];W[ro];B[sq]
LB[or:B][rr:A]C[JL: this doesn't look good for black as 'A' is just too good for white now. Black should have played 'B' to revert to the standard variation. Now it looks like black will more or less die.]
;W[rr];B[or];W[nq];B[ph]LB[dh:D][pg:C][pi:B][qh:A]C[JL: wrong invasion point. Typically the proper invasion/reduction points in a 'three space position' like this one are in the order of severity 'A', 'B' and 'C'. In this position 'C' would be bad as white would just connect, but the other two are ok, however it is more urgent for black to defend against the white invasion of 'D'.
Also notice  the black stones in the corner still have some aji left in them.]
;W[of]LB[qh:A]C[JL: a positive approach, though white can also consider 'A'.]
;B[nh];W[mf];B[ld]LB[lh:A][qh:B]C[JL: this is bad. It is the other two black stones which are weak and need to be protected, so 'A' or something is better. After all, white can not invade deep here before he has settled his group ('B' or whatever).]
;W[lh]C[JL: severe attack, black is in trouble.];B[qj]LB[oj:A]
C[JL: I don't like this move - instead 'A' is maybe better. When black plays this bottom tsuke he is usually after building eyes in the side, but now it is impossible to do that here,]
;W[pi]LB[qi:A]C[JL: I think cut of 'A' gives a better result for white, but am not sure. Pushing oneself like this against opponent's stone is usually bad style as it takes away liberties from the white stones. Often still in tight combat it can be the right move.]
;B[qi];W[qh]
(;B[rh]C[JL: it is painful to have to help white like this - this move is usually bad. The variations are more interesting.]
;W[qg]C[JL: suddenly white has no real weaknesses.];B[pk];W[ok]
;B[ol];W[pl]C[JL: no need to help black here by making this atari.]
;B[qk];W[nl]MA[or][pq][qq][rp][sq]LB[oj:A][rn:B]C[JL: horrible white blunder. Black simply can not ignore the juicy double atari of 'A'.  After that the black group will be rock solid and white will be overconcentated. Also the marked stones in the corner may still come to live cause of the clamp of 'B'.]
;B[om]C[JL: now white can breath again as black ignored the gift.]
;W[nj]C[JL: now white can breath again as black ignored the gift.]
;B[qm];W[qn];B[pn]LB[dg:A]C[JL: was this move necessary? Instead 'A' or so.]
;W[rm]C[JL: was this move necessary? Instead 'A' or so.];B[rl]
;W[oo]LB[rq:A]C[JL: of white wants to play solid and safe, 'A' is the move, but still this move is quite useless.]

(;B[ec]CR[dj]MA[ic][ld][nd][pd][qc]LB[dg:A]C[JL: locally wrong move. It is too close to the strong black group (marked stones) and does not streghten the lone black stone (circle) on the side. Locally something around 'A' is better. Also the high shimari looks better than the low one here.]
;W[ie]LB[dh:A]C[JL: invasion of 'A' is much better. In order to use all the thickness white has he must attack now.]
;B[kf]C[JL: a positive move, separates the lone white stone nicely.]
;W[gd]C[JL: daring. It is not a good idea to approach strong groups with a weak one.]

(;B[hd]MA[ie]LB[gc:B][gf:C][he:A]C[JL: usually the other cut is better and as the ladder is good for black, I would have played it ('A'). White should probably now ignore the marked stone and play 'B'. Still the idea of cutting is often right. Here maybe the best idea would be to  attack the whole white group by playing at 'C' (see variation) instead.]

(;W[he];B[ge]
(;W[fe]LB[gc:A]C[JL: white is trying too much to live everywhere. Something needs to be sacrificed. For example 'A' before this atari looks more promising.]
;B[gf];W[ed]C[JL: the last couple of white moves have basicly forced black to separate white groups strongly. This just can not be good for white.]
;B[fc];W[dd];B[dc]C[JL: white shape absolutely horrible.];W[ce]

(;B[cc]MA[dd][ed]C[JL: maybe better to take the cutting stone and reduce the liberties of the marked two stones. After all, white can't cut here.]
;W[dh];B[fd]LB[cj:A]C[JL: bad timing I think as now white can play 'A' to make shape. Though, it does look like an uphill battle for white.]
;W[fi]C[JL: white is thinking he is attacking black, but as his own group is so thin it is hard to imagine much to come from this attack.]
;B[fj]LB[ch:A]C[JL: maybe the other tsuke first ('A')];W[ei]
C[JL: this seems strong.]
(;B[ej]C[JL: very bad move. Now white has sente and black has a heavy group inside white sphere of influence. Black is faced with a tough battle now.]
;W[gi]LB[ci:A]C[JL: insted white probably should have prevented eyes from black while making eye space for himself by playing at 'A' or so.]
;B[gj]C[JL: black plays too heavy. When one is under pressure one needs to either make eyes there and now, or use flexible shape to escape.]
;W[hi]C[JL: I have no clue what white has planned to do with this useless wall...]
;B[hj];W[ig]MA[dj][ej][fj][gj][hj]C[JL. white is overly preoccupied with the survival of his useless stones.  Why not attack black marked group?]
;B[de]C[JL: big, but the priority is to seek safety with the weak group first.]
;W[gn]C[JL. solid, but slow. Hard to see what the best move is though.]
;B[hl];W[hn]LB[in:A]C[JL: ikken-tobi of 'A' is faster.];B[ii]
C[JL: still an interesting fight.];W[ih];B[jj];W[ji];B[kj]LB[ik:A]
C[JL: odd move, but I guess black has the idea of making eye shape with the stone of 'A'. Yet another possibility was to atari one line higher.]
;W[ki]C[JL: I don't get this move as eating the stone in atari is most natural thing to do.]
;B[li]LB[cl:A]C[JL: very much an overplay. As white will now eat the marked stone this stone will look a bit like a gift. Instead black might have wanted to try to make eyespace with moves like 'A' or so.]
;W[mi]LB[ij:A]C[JL: I just don't understand what is so bad about eating shape ruining stones when they are offered :) ('A')]
;B[lj];W[kg]C[JL: by eating the lone black stone instead white would get sente and could even try to kill the black dragon.]
;B[mk];W[nk];B[ml];W[nm];B[km];W[mm]C[JL: moves like this are slow and inefficient and help the opponent more than oneself.]
;B[lm];W[im];B[il];W[jm];B[jl]C[JL: white managed to help black live easily while gaining almost nothing in the process.]
;W[jo]MA[cf][er][rc]C[JL: yet anohter useless move. It does not attack, it does not defend, it does not take territory, nor destroy it. Basicly white played a dame. There are tons of big moves left in the game, some of them in no particular order are marked on the board.]
;B[dr]C[JL: big move];W[er]C[JL: I'm not sure this is not an aji-keshi. No reason to really play it yet anyhow as it takes away one liberty from one's own group.]
;B[es];W[dq];B[cr];W[cq]LB[bq:A]C[JL: jump of 'A' is better locally than this ugly shape.]
;B[br];W[kk]C[JL: white donated black one point here. If black manages to die somehow it'll be cause of major blundering by him.]
;B[kl]C[JL: no real reason to play inside. Black could simply make the eyespace even larger or creater anohter eye by playing almost anywhere on the left hand side.]
;W[lk];B[mj]C[JL: instead it is better to make eyes than play gote moves like this.]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[ni]C[JL: again white gives away sente in order to be able to donate black a gift of one point.]
;B[gg]MA[ii]C[JL: there are much bigger points on board. Maybe black just forgot that the marked stone can be eaten...]
;W[po]C[JL: well, this is sente, but that's just about it.]
;B[pm];W[df];B[ee];W[cf];B[di];W[eh];B[hh];W[ij]C[JL: finally the stone gets removed...]
;B[ik];W[ii];B[jd];W[fk]C[JL: ajikeshi (potential removing bad move)]
;B[gk];W[id];B[gc];W[rc];B[rb];W[je];B[ke];W[oc];B[od];W[mc]
;B[nc];W[qd];B[pc]LB[qb:A]C[JL: 'A' better.];W[dl];B[ao];W[bo]
;B[ap];W[bp];B[an];W[ci];B[nr];W[mr];B[rq];W[ns];B[qr]
(;W[os]C[JL: and now black can live. The proper move is in the variation.]

(;B[kr]C[JL: black is being too kind. See the variation how to live in the corner.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[ho];B[gq]LB[rs:A]C[JL: no reason for black to connect here. White will only make about three points in sente here. There are bigger moves for black all over the board, I would for example save the corner stones with 'A'.]
;W[le];B[if]LB[md:A]C[JL: ouch - now white will connect at 'A' which is bigger and way more sente than what black tries to trick to himself.]
;W[hf]LB[md:A]C[JL: 'A' was the move.];B[jf];W[hg];B[sm];W[rn]
LB[so:A]C[JL: Noooo, now black connected happily with 'A'. White can not afford to save that one stone.]
;B[so];W[qo];B[sn];W[md];B[ne];W[me]LB[lc:A]C[JL: better to play the atari of 'A' first as it is proper timing for that now.]
;B[nf];W[rg];B[si];W[ob]C[JL: desperate. This won't work without black co-operating.]
;B[nb];W[pb];B[qb];W[mb];B[na];W[sb];B[mg]MA[if][jf][ke][kf]
LB[kb:A][oh:C][ra:B]C[JL: because of this exchange the marked stones also lose a liberty. It would have been better to threathen to play this move by making a small looking move like 'A' which also would threathen to pull the black dragon out. If or when needed black corner can live easily by playing at 'B'. Also black connection of 'C' is tough for white to handle as he will only have one eye on the side.]
;W[lf];B[pa]LB[ra:A]C[JL: and now black neatly loses his eyes. Black 'A' instead would have made it impossible for white to kill the dragon.]
;W[ra];B[ma]C[JL: How can black escape?];W[lb]LB[kb:A]C[JL: more normal shape is the jump of 'A'.]
;B[kb]C[JL: black finds a neat move, but no follow-up.];W[kc]

(;B[sc]C[JL: see alternatives.];W[sd]
(;B[qe]C[JL: why not connect the cutting stone?];W[re];B[sf]
LB[oh:A]C[JL: white 'A' saves the stones.];W[pe]LB[oh:A]C[JL: black 'A' will solve black's problems as white only has two gote eyes.]
;B[pg]C[JL: this does not work - simple connection would have removed the eyes.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[pf];B[sg];W[ng]C[JL: what a disaster for black who was winning until this corner struggle started.]
;B[rf]LB[ka:B][la:A]C[JL: black didn't like sente too much and decided to play a almost worthless gote move. How about instead of this playing at 'A' to try to save the dragon? 'B' no longer works.]
;W[mh]LB[jb:A]C[JL: no real need for white to answer here. Instead he should finnish the kill and win the game ('A' or whatever).]

(;B[jc]MA[ma][na][nb][nc][nd][ne][nf][od][pa][pc][pd][qb][qc]
[rb]C[JL: Black sacrifices the marked stones to save six stones. There was still a ko possible.]

(;W[pr];B[qs];W[ef];B[ff]C[JL: the hane in the corner was bigger.]
;W[gh]LB[bd:A]C[JL: two points - have of 'A' would have been much much more for white...]

;B[se];W[qe]C[JL: why connect?];B[aq];W[tt];B[tt]C[JL: Both players should practise reading a lot, and life&death.  Also you should both learn to figure out which groups are strong and which are weak. The play was also overly aggressive - lots of attempts to kill with no other plan. Killing usually fails - attacking is usually done to make territory or thickness. Anyhow, in order to attack (and defend) well, one needs to read well. Trying to play go with poor reading skills is like building a house on sand - solid foundations are what is needed in both case. Also it is important to realize which stones are to be sacrificed and which are to be fought for. In priciple the cutting stones one tries to save, but others one can quite easily discard.]
