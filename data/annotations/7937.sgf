C[Hello =)
I'm Hataycan, this was a game with my all-time rival which we started to play together so its an important game for me. I lost by 9.5 points. Here we go =)

Hi, I'm W, and I'll be separating my comments from yours like this.]
;B[qf]C[I like trying some new opening moves =D

Me too! Reading joseki and seeing what the pros play are other ways of improving fuseki.]
;W[dp];B[op];W[nc]
(;B[qc]LB[pc:B][qc:A]C[-- W --
This move seems premature. The R14 aims towards the right hand side, not the corner. If black wants a corner, playing C17 is bigger.

This corner position has actually happened in some professional games, and both R17 and Q17 have been played, but not immediately; in all the games I could find, the two 6-3 stones are left alone in the corner until there is some play on the sides, typically spilling over from one of the adjacent corners or fighting in the middle.]
;W[pc]C[-- W --
This both contradicts white's initial play -O17 aims at the top side not the corner-, and is bad tactically - it attaches to a stone white would want to attack thus just making it stronger.]
(;B[pd]LB[pb:B][pd:A][qd:C]C[-- W --
This does not seem good. Black is strenghtening white's stone, without strengthening his own comparatively. After white Q18, black would be at a deficit in this spot, having to add another defensive move later.

The right move seems to me to be R16 - it defends solidly, and leaves white very volunerable to attack.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[cd];B[pb]C[-- W --
This is a very small move this early in the game. White has two corners, and a formation by black's top right corner, but black keep playing on one side of the board. This leaves white to try to dominate the rest of the board.]
;W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[og];W[jd]
(;B[ec]LB[ec:A][cf:D][jj:F][qj:B][ck:C][fq:E]C[-- W --
This plays into white's hand. A natural move for white even without the black stone is G17, the long knight's jump down from K16. Black's best bet here is to either reduce from the outside, or just leave the area alone and try to profit from building up his own territories or attacking white elsewhere.

If you feel you must approach in the top, a high approach is much less likely to be pushed around by white.]
;W[gc];B[ee];W[cf];B[cb];W[ge];B[ff];W[gf]C[-- W --
White has made the top huge, and has almost settled the top left white stones, while leaving black floating.]
;B[bc]TR[db][eb][cc][dc][ed]C[-- W --

In conclusion, I would say that black lacks mostly in the tactical. Fights that go poorly, possibilities that go unseen, and overly defensive moves when they aren't strictly necessary.

Both players should avoid playing too close to stones you want to attack, which tend to only make them solid.

Black should probably think a bit more on the late opening as well, and develop the initial opening with some planning for how to continue in the various scenarios his opponent can play out.]

This would be marginally better, but is still really poor in that black has all his stones on one side of the board. If you fear a moyo, play in the middle of the left side, or make an aggressive play from an approach move to the lower left stone.

Or, if you feel like unorthodox play, put a stone down on tengen. That tends to limit any omoyo strategies.]
