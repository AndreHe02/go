C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking at my game. As this is a very short one and all the moves up until the point where a big fight breaks out, there isn't much to say as to what aspects of the game I'm uncertain about. Nevertheless while covering the fight please focus on general principles and shapes rather than difficult and long variations, unless those tend to occur often in games. Also please comment on my thought process, which I explain every move, since thats what needs to be corrected. The game is only 78 moves long when I die after a fight for the second time in the game. Appart from that I also included some questions about the joseki sequence at the beginning. I hope you find this short game interesting and very much look forward to your response.

TM: Hello, my name is Tom치코 and I will review your games. I will prefix my comments with TM.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp]C[This is what I always play based on the argument that at my level it largely doesn't matter what initial opening moves one plays. Nevertheless I know way too many joseki for my level, which remains utterly useless in my games.

Nevertheless I noticed that I find approaching 3-4 stones uncomfortable (one of the features in this game) and maybe I should start playing them too...]
;W[dq];B[do];W[co]C[I don't play avalanche...];B[cn];W[cp]
(;B[fc]C[This move is apparantly very popular and as far as I understand it it either allows white to split at D6 while black gets to double approach (I never get a good result after double approaching, not even when white ignores it twice) or white's response at the top helps black decide if he wants to play d6 or d7. If white backs off at d14 then black plays D7 looking forward to playing an extension at C11, if white plays further down black connects solidly and is content with an extension at c10.

However this kind of theory isn't applicable to my games. I include one variation where I don't know how to respond.

TM: As you say, this seems to be somewhat high-level concept, given how the rest of your game went. I would suggest simpler moves here (see variations): continue localy and finish the joseki.]

(;W[cf];B[dm]TR[eq]C[Looking at c11 according to plan, however noone at my level actually finishes the joseki on the bottom. I don't really know why that move at F3 is thought of so highly, as white's corner already seems safe and if black tries to seal from the right, white can fight back quite severely. This has happened in several of my games.

TM: I would not concern myself with what everyone "at my level" plays. If you want to get better at go, you cannot just play what everybody around you plays. I would suggest always finishing the joseki, unless you have a clear and sound reason not to.

F3 is important, because if white doesn't play it, then after B E3 white needs to defend and gives black a lot of influence (see variations).]

(;W[dj]C[I believe the normal responses here are E3 and F4. I chose F4, since E3 has gotten me killed before. F4 also seems dangerous though; I try to look at whites most severe way of playing in the variation.]

(;B[fp]C[TM: I would play E3 here, to get influence on the right side. F4 is usually played when there is no white stone around D10. White blocks one side and blacks gets the other. Here the left side is already blocked and white can block the bottom as well, leaving you with somewhat weak group and almost no points.]

(;W[fr]TR[er]C[this move seems rather slow. I tenuki. Nevertheless I don't like the result in the bottom left corner. I have to eyespace let alone a base there while white has a solid corner and some potential. My group might be hard to attack right now, but the peep at e6 will start an attack eventually. Due to these defects that doesn't even look like "strength" facing the center.

TM: White plays this to prevent black sente at the traingled position.
Black position is not great, but since this is the "white side" of the board and black has sente to expand his side, I think it's OK.]
;B[jd];W[hc]TR[cc][jc][hd]C[This move is very unusual. I respond normally, on top. My goals are to make white capture f17, take his corner and build from the top right corner.

TM: On the contrary, this is a very common move, although it might be too soon to play it here. You have several ways to counter it (the most common are marked with triangles). If you want the corner, you can go straight for it with C17 (see variation).

(;B[hd];W[ic]C[this is also unusual. I should certainly just connect, but I chose to block hoping to make territory on the right. That was a bad idea...]
;B[jc]C[TM: If you wanted to block, you could have blocked right away, instead of H16 (see variation).]
;W[id];B[ie];W[gd]C[I was fully prepared to give up H16 but here I connect since it's sente and white must connect at g17.]
;B[he];W[gc];B[cc]C[Now I take the corner. Maybe this is an overplay and I should fix the cut at K15 somehow? How severe is that cut? How easy will it be for white to invade and reduce all of my potential in the top right?

TM: I think that you should have taken the corner earlier, before you made the white invading stones stronger.
Connecting might be the right choice here.];W[dc];B[db];W[cd]
;B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[je]C[White cuts right away. Not sure what to do here. I decide that I want to solidify the right side and then run with my 3 stones.]
;B[ke];W[jf]
(;B[ig]C[This might be the wrong way to run though. I played this move since it looks like it puts pressure on the white cutting stones, however maybe I should play something that threatens to disconnect H17 to gain some strength first?

TM: H17 seems very hard to kill now. I would just leave the three stones and try to gain some influence on the right side (see variation).]
;W[kf]C[Here I'm very uncertain what to do. White's followups in that area seem severe.]
;B[le]C[TM: This is OK.];W[if]C[and now white can just cut and kill me. Looking at this in retrospect, this game is already pretty much lost.

TM: The game is not lost yet, see variation.]
(;B[hf];W[hg];B[fe]C[Might not be the best way to run. I'm trying to threaten white's weak group.

TM: You can't really run out here. The stones around H15 are dead. If white connects at B16, black stones in the corner are also dead.]

(;W[hh]C[strange move but it threatens a ladder that I unfortunately miss in the game. Not that it matters, my stones are dead one way or the other.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[gf];W[ff];B[qf]C[I decide to use the aji of my dead stones later and prevent a white invasion in this corner. Probably white can just play Q17 or Q18 and live? In any case the game is basically lost.]
;W[bd]C[White decides he wants to kill my corner as well. It's actually not that easy to live, it seems; A18 doesn't seem to do the job here.

TM: There seems to be one variation that you found that ends with a ko.]

(;B[gb]C[I play this move, which still looks like the best attempt at living to me.]
;W[hb]C[Here I have a few ways to connect. Probably the one I chose was not the best one.]

(;B[fb];W[ab];B[ec];W[ea];B[da];W[ga]C[I think this is a mistake by white, resulting in a liberty shortage for him,...]
;B[fa]C[Since he can't respond again here and has to play B19.]
;W[ba]
(;B[ib]C[I find this move which connects out. The other possibility looks better though.]
;W[gg];B[ha];W[jb];B[ia];W[kb]C[I don't think this should work for white but I messed up as usual. The game doesn't go much longer.]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[mc]C[I decide that I can play this in terms of capturing race - liberties with the corner.]
;W[mb]
(;B[nb];W[kc];B[kd];W[ja];B[ga];W[nc]C[Here I play another blunder. I should atari and only then extend, right?]

(;B[ob];W[md];B[ld];W[me]C[I resign. Haven't been destroyed like this for a while now. In any case, I hope you will be able to tell me why this happened and how I should approach the position in order to prevent risky fights. Once again, thank you for looking into my game.

TM: You lost because you tried to do four things at once. You switched from one to another without finishing the former. This resulted in failing to achieve any of them.

At first you tried to keep white in. That is possible, but white will live and ruin black's potential at the top. When you saw that, you tried to block instead. But instead of finishing that, you jumped into the corner and white cut. You didn't finish the invasion by taking at B17 and instead tried to save 3 stones.

Learn to finish things you start. The same goes for the joseki in the beginning. You wouldn't have to worry about an unusual situation, if you finished the joseki. Of course, there might be good reasons to left something unfinished. But unless you have such a reason, don't do it.

Unless your opponent is several stones weaker, you cannot just take everything. You must decide which side is bigger and leave the other one for the opponent. If you try to take everything at once, you end up with nothing.

I think you would also benefit from solving some life-and-death problems, to learn when you need to make your position stronger and get better at reading.

Thank you for sending your game with a lot of comments and questions. I enjoyed answering them and hope that my explanations help.

Have fun playing go!
