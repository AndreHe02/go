(;B[jc];W[hc]C[Gus: Crazy, but it's hard to find a good move for white now. B is solid and making territory on both sides, white is weak, and probably can only run. This should end badly for white.]

Gus: You need to do problems to improve your reading. Until this blunder, you were clearly winning.]
;W[lc];B[fe]C[Gus: It's amazing how fast the tide can turn :) White lived in sente, and made at least 12 points in a side that belonged to black. The solid white group means that black probably can never make an effective moyo. Score at this point:

Lower side: equal for both (ignore)

White: 22points
Upper L 10 pts
Upper side 12 pts

Black 
uppr right 20 points

[fp][gp][hp][ip][jp][kp][lp][mp][np][op][oq][or][os]C[Gus: Opening theory says play in the middle of the biggest side first if you get the opportunity. This is not to say that it is the only move, or always the right move but you need to decide why your move is better than the theory move before you play it. 

The biggest side is usually, the width of the side plus the hight of the tallest corner facing that side.

Left: 9 spaces + 4 high (lower left) = 13
Bottom: 11 spaces + 4 high = 15
Right: 10 spaces, + 6 high = 16

Conclusion, White should probably break up the right side.]
;W[dj]C[Gus: If you know your opening theory, you kow white is playing slightly slowly.]
(;B[pj]C[Good :)]
(;W[qn]C[Gus: Risky by white. Rich men don't pick fights... White has a problem with jealousy of the opponent's territory (something to remember as you play the rest of the game).]

(;W[fp];B[ck]C[Should this have been at B4?

Gus: Yes. You are outnumbered 4-1 (before you make this move. The only reasonable result is for you to live small. This asks for too much and strengthen's white in the process.]
;W[bp]C[Gus: Your opponent is slack here, This should be at A]
(;B[pk]C[Gus: Slack];W[ql]C[Gus: Whtie got stronger, you gave up your attack, for a single outside stone.]
