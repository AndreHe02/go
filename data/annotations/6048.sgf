C[Hello

My name is Roland Schatz. I played white in this game.

The game was played on KGS. The time controls were 25:00 main time plus 5 times 30 seconds, and both players used up the main time, so this was a rather slow game.

Currently I'm 8k. A few weeks ago I was winning nearly every game as 8k, sometimes briefly advancing to 7k, but always quickly dropping back. Recently my play seems to degrade a bit, especially when playing white. I wonder if I might have picked up some bad habit that I'm not aware of...

I lost the game by 10.5, including 0.5 komi. Of course I found a few mistakes I made, but I also found some mistakes by my opponent, and in the end I'm not really sure why I have lost this game. I have the feeling that my fuseki was not very good, but I don't know where exactly I went wrong.

I went over the game myself and tried to explain the reasoning behind my moves. I often just "thought out loud", and analysed the moves as if it were a fact. This does not mean I think I'm 100% correct about those things, it's just to show you what I thought during the game. In fact, I'm almost sure my statements are not correct, because according to my own analysis I should not have lost :P

I would appreciate it if you could not only correct my moves, but also the thinking behind my moves.

Thanks in advance

A: Hi, I am Avi, a 3K (IGS) player.
Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. I am not a very strong player - so take my comment with caution. 
My comments will start with "A:".
Your feedback to the review will be appreciated.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[jq]C[Roland: This is my first game against the chinese opening, and I have not really studied it. I know black wants to build a big framework, so I try to limit it with my last move. I chose to limit the bottom side because the Q3 stone is facing there, while Q16 is neutral, facing neither side...

A: My feeling is that O17 is better in this position. It forces Black to choose between giving away the corner and letting white establish strong presence on the top. K3 is too far from D4, and does not really have effect on Q3.]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[Roland: I don't want black to have both sides, so I chose the pincer.

I know this will propably lead to a fight along the left side anyway, so in hindsight I think this is not really the best choice, even though the opponent did not attack the pincer immediately. But all other joseki that I know give black the left side, and with the big moyo at the right side this seems inacceptable.

A: Your move is fine.];B[en];W[fp];B[fc]C[Roland: This move seems strange, I would have expected an attack on my pincer. This move just invites me to build a framework on the left side.]
;W[df];B[ic]SQ[pg][ph][qg][qh]CR[pn][po][qn][qo]TR[lc][ld][mc]
[md]C[Roland: Now black has a huge framework with basically three weak areas. My plan is to try and invade at least two of them, otherwise black would be ahead too much.

A: I think you see more in Black's framework than it really is at this stage. Black cannot enclose the whole area in 1 or even 2 moves. White has a noce enclosure of its own, and moreover - Black has a week group (E6) waiting to be attacked and by the way let White gain more territory.]
;W[nc]SQ[pg][ph][qg][qh]CR[pn][po][qn][qo]C[Roland: I decided for this area first. This seems the easiest invasion, because of the open 4-4 corner. The squared area seemed not so good to me, because I risk that black is able to secure both the triangles and the circles during the fight around the squares.

With this move, I thought black would almost certainly close the square area, and then my next move could invade the circle area.

A: As explained in the previous comment, I would attack E6 - for example by WE8, BG6, WH4 etc.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc]C[Roland: This looks like the wrong side to me.

A:I agree.];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]TR[fc]
[ic][lc]C[Roland: To me, the triangled stones look ridiculous in relation to the strong wall, so in the game I was quite content with the result here. Sure, black has pretty much secured the top side, but it looks very inefficient, so this should be good for me, right?

A: Yes, but the problem is White ended in gote. This allows Black to attend to its weak group E6 and turn the table on White in this important area.]
;B[dj]C[A: D9 is the joseky - see next comment.];W[ch]C[Roland: This reduction was expected, these things happen when leaving a side open so long. But I didn't see this as a problem during the game, because there is still an invasion possible at the bottom right.

The idea behind my move here was to take a rather large corner. I know the top left corner is not really secure, but I expect I'm able to take at least one of the two left corners, effectively treating these as miai.

A: This looks submissive to me. I would play E8, splitting and attacking E6 and D10; One of the groups might die during the process.]
;B[cj]C[A: E8 is better - connects the Black group together and starts building a wall towards the center. C8 is left with a lot of aji. Even if C8 is captured, Black is over concentrated.]
;W[qn]C[Roland: Now I practically have to invade here, to make up for the loss on the left side.

A: Playing right in the middle is not optimal. You better take one side, 'lean' on it and build strength to attack the other side. I would prefer Q5 or R5.]
;B[po];W[pn]C[Roland: Threatening R11 next.];B[qh];W[oo];B[op]
;W[no];B[qo];W[rn]C[Roland: Putting pressure on the corner...]
;B[ro];W[np];B[nq];W[ol]C[Roland: Now jump out into the center while defending the cutting point.

A: In the last sequence Black gained th corner, let black live on the side and made no points. Moreover - he ended in gote.]
;B[hp]C[A: Wrong - Black cannot start a new group while E6 is not fully settled yet.]
;W[hq]C[A: Submissive and wrong direction. G5 is the right play; Brings up the aji of C8 and attacks H4.]
;B[go];W[gp];B[ho];W[iq]C[Roland: Black could have made this a lot harder on me...]
;B[el];W[co]C[Roland: Time to take some territory...

A: Time to count as well.

W: ~20 top left, ~25 bottom left, ~10 top right, komi 0.5 = 55.5

B: ~18 bottom right, ~12 left side, ~25 top, ~5 right side = 60

Black leads slightly, he has also sente and better access to the center.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[rg];B[qg];W[rf]C[Roland: These responses were neccesary to live I think. Black doesn't seem to have gained a lot in this exchange.

A: I disagree. A black move now at around M13 would be very big.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[fe];W[ni]C[Roland: Black tries to build a framework on the top side, so I reduce it.]
;B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[pl];W[om];B[oj];W[kl]C[Roland: Here I am a bit insecure. I think black could have made the fight a lot harder on me. The last move was to shut in (kill?) O8. Was this neccessary, or should I have gone deeper into the black mojo?

A: This is one of those "one purpose" moves you should try to avoid. Try to use your stones to do double work. For example: J7 which also threatens the F5 cut or even O13. It will ne be easy for Black to pull his O8 out.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[mi];W[li];B[mh]
(;W[jj]C[Roland: Black builds a little territory around his wall. Again I think I should be satisfied with the result, his wall looks even more inefficient now.

The last move was perhaps a bit over-protective, but I think the cut at M10 would work because of the O8 stone. See variations.

A: M12 is a must here!];B[hl];W[jn];B[jo];W[ko];B[lq]C[Roland: This move came as a bit of a surprise to me. I didn't really pay attention in this direction, so I overestimated my territory here. Not that it did much damage...]
;W[jp];B[io];W[lp]C[A: Small. M12 is much bigger.];B[lh]C[A: Big.

Let us count again:

W: ~18 top left, ~12 top right, ~28 bottom left, ~18 center, komi 0.5 = 76.5

B: ~18 bottom right, ~12 left side;
This means Black needs ~50 points at the top to win. With M12, this seems easy. 

This is my last main comment.

So to summarize:The main mistakes you made in this game are related to direction of play and 'looking at the whole board'. I did not see you counting during the game - this is very important. I suggest you look at games of stronger players, try to exercise counting and understand direction of plays. GTL site has a lot of commented games with relevant comments on this issue.

I hope this review will help you - again, you feedback is very much welcome.]
;W[ki];B[jh];W[hg]C[Roland: This seems like a good reduction point, with the threat to run either left or down.]
;B[fg];W[hi];B[ii];W[ij];B[hj]
(;W[kh]C[Roland: This was propably not the best move (see variations).]

(;W[ri]C[Roland: I think this move was a big mistake, fortunately black did not notice.]
;B[rh];W[sh];B[rj];W[si]C[Roland: See variation here for why I think move 110 was a mistake.

At this point I could still have turned the big loss into a small loss by giving up T10 and S11, but I did only notice a move later. Fortunately black didn't notice either ;)]

(;B[qi];W[sg];B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[ql]C[Roland: I don't understand this move. Does this do anything?]
;W[da];B[ea]C[Roland: Big mistake.];W[eb];B[ec];W[fa];B[fb]
;W[ea];B[ga];W[ca];B[gb];W[bn]C[Roland: I realise this move is not very large in itself, but it has a huge followup at B7, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to end in sente here.]
;B[bm];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[cm];W[bi]C[Roland: Seems like a very big point now.

A: Yes, and it is sente - you cannot tenuki here.];B[kr];W[kq]
;B[mq];W[jr];B[ls];W[il]C[Roland: I propably should have played B9 instead.

A: Right.];B[mp]
(;W[mo]C[Roland: B9 still possible, the cut here doesn't look important.]

;B[hk];W[gm];B[jm];W[kn]C[Roland: This sequence also ended very well for me. I think the rest are only small endgame moves.]
;B[fo];W[fm];B[em];W[aj]C[Roland: At first I thought this would be sente, but of course it's not.]
;B[ak];W[ai];B[ed];W[de];B[hf]C[Roland: I think this would have been a good candidate instead of the gote move at A10 ;)]

;W[eg];B[ef];W[ee];B[ff];W[pm]C[Roland: This move doesn't really do anything besides being a single point in gote. Better E10?]
;B[ei];W[fh];B[dh];W[dg];B[di];W[js];B[fk];W[gl];B[ks];W[gk]

[sb][sc][sd][se][sf]C[Roland: You see, I have not really found any major mistakes on my side (except the one that black did not punish, so that one didn't really lose the game).

On the other hand, I found a lot of black plays that were not very good. Still I lost the game by 10.5 points.

So where did I make these mistakes that lost me the game? Or were the black moves that I saw as bad moves not so bad?

Again, thanks for your time and effort. I hope you can help me improve my game.]
