C[Hello, and thank you for reviewing my game =)

I wasn't aware that I was loosing until part way through the game, at which point I had to fight to try to come back. By the end, I was quite far behind and resigned.

This is  not a bad move,  but you should take into account you are giving your opponent a large move around K16. 
This will work very well with his chinese opening.

For a chinese opening, (as well as san-ren-sei), the area around K16 is crucial.]

This feels a bit slow. You are playing on one side of the board, while black is developing rapidly.]
;B[fq]C[

Now it can be seen that black develops quickly, and keeps initiative. All the white stones are on the left side, while black's covers almost the whole board. This opening is a success for black.]

This is too early, and it is unclear what you want to accomplish with this move. You will only make black stronger.

I would propose playing q15, or r15. That area is crucial now - when black plays there,  invasion will be difficult for you.]
;B[mo];W[np];B[oq];W[oo]C[
M >

You are just crawling, and not attacking anything. You are only making black more solid, and not getting anything in return. You are playing dame-points, while the opening isn't even over yet !!

You already made black's group around q4 very solid, giving him points in the corner -- all for free.

Your group is fine for now,  you should tenuki.];B[qn]C[
M >

Ka-ching ! Mega amount of points for black. And he all got it because you provoked him to take it.

This is terrible for white.

All your moves were saying: "Please, dear black, make your corner solid and take lots of points,... I will just play all these dame-points and get nothing in return"]
;W[io];B[fm]C[
M >

Not necessary for black -- both of you should be playing around q15 now.]
;W[im];B[mm]C[
M >

Not necessary, black should play around q15.];W[om]C[
M >

You want to attack the n7 group ? It will be very hard to catch it -- it can easily run. And when you don't catch it, what have you gained by this move?]
;B[ql]C[
M >

Look, your move p7 just provoked black even more to take points and make his groups solid. You gave him dozens of points again.

What is more important -- you cannot invade on the right anymore. Black is solid now.

You shouldn't make the groups of your opponent strong when you don't gain anything in return.]
;W[ok]C[
M >

The same applies to this jump, and the next one.];B[mk];W[oi]
;B[kq]C[I didn't see the cut comming at all.

Is there a way to connect here?

--

M > 

This whole problem arises because you added all of the stones n4, o4, p5 etc. to your group. Now when M3 gets cut off, it is painful, whereas earlier, you could've just given up that stone.

Before N4, you should have left this position and played elsewhere on the board.

L3 is a very good move by black,. However, white can connect by playing L2.]

Uh, you should read ahead before playing each move :\]];B[on]
;W[qe]C[
M >

You should have played this immediately, instead of n4. Try to keep an eye out for the large points on the board. When it is not necessary to play locally, just play the large point on the board.]
;B[qd]C[Here I surveyed the game, and I pretty much figured that if that group died, I lose the game, so I decided to connect and fight it out.


M > 

Yes,  it looks hard now for white. However, you *have to* give up the stones at p11, p9 etc. (I assume this is the group you wanted to save ?) If you try to desperately connect, you are only inviting disaster. I know it's hard, but it's essential to *let go * of stones which cannot serve any purpose.

Blakc can happily let you connect, -- and in the meantime, he will grab truckloads of points, and easily win the game.


You should try to attack and kill something of black, to compensate for the losses you hvae suffered in the lower right corner.]
;W[pg]C[
M >

This doesn't connect. Remeber that the keima shape (the "horse-jump" shape, q13, r15) is cuttable. (That's why the proverb says: don't run with a keima).]
;B[ph];W[oh]C[Here, again, I felt I could ditch the 3 stones, but I decided to fight

M >

You can only fight when you have a weak group of your opponent to attack. Here, black is solid all around, so you have little chance of gaining anything in the attack.

The whole idea of linking up these stones is misguided.];B[og]
C[Here again I felt I could ditch the stones and attack instead, but decided against it.]

(;W[ng];B[of];W[nf];B[oe];W[mh]C[

You have given black 40 points on the right. What did you get in return ? Sure, you have linked up your stones, and gotten out into the center. But where are your points? Black can just let you live, in the center, invade on the left and win the game.]

;W[ie];B[id];W[ke];B[kd];W[nn]C[

Very strange. Why have you played J15 and L15? What are these moves doing for you?
 They better do something, because they gave black the whole top side (about 40 pts) !

Usually J 15 is played when you want to cut at H 16, but here that would be bad, because black is alive on both sides (K16 group and F 10 group.)]

Nice way of using the aji of h16];B[hc]C[Right now I feel like I'm already losing by quite a bit.

M >

Yes,  you should play a couple moves more, and then resign. Black has the whole right side, plus an enourmous corner. You have only potential territory at the left, and it can be invaded easily by black (D 8 is a very painful point).

Moreover, your center group is in critical condition, and can be attacked by black (for instance, L 10 makes k11 a false eye).]
;W[ff];B[gf]
(;W[fg]C[

Good idea of attacking D14 !

If you can kill it, you may still have a chance. However, you really have to worry about the eyes of your group in the center.

But this is not the right move, unfortunately, you should play E 13. Your stones don't have many lberties.]

Good move by black. You either connect and let black live on the side (not an option for you, because you cannot afford to lose much points (you're beind by about 20), or you take one side and let black reduce you.

This is however also not an option for you.]

M >

This was a fun game to review.

It's obvious that all of your problems in this game were created by the move N 4 and the sequence of moves you played after that. You played only on dame-points, while making your opponent stronger.

Try not to give your opponent a good reason to make his groups solid. Keep them thin and weak, so you can attack later.

When you play a move, make sure that is *does * something for you. All of your stones at N4, Q7 , -- the whole group on the right, which became such a big problem --  did not serve any purpose. It did not surround any territory, and it did not attack any groups of black (black was solid on the right, and capturing the center was not reasonable).

You made the common mistake of starting to fight much too early.

N4  was a strange move. Perhaps you thought you could split or attack black. But it was much too early for that, since the opening was not over yet. Fights are for the middle-game. A good rule of thumb is to play in the largest open area of the board in the opening, and to have your stones all over the board.

At some points you made obvious reading errors. Try to stay focused during play, and read at least 3-4 moves ahead. Doing a lot of go-problems may help you with this.

My nick on KGS and on Oro is "ignus". Feel free to ask me anything about this review, if something is not clear, or if you have questions. You can also just ask for a game, I'm often willing to help out :\]

You can also of course send me an email.

Cheers !
