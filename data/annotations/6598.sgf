;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[ep];W[gq]C[CG: The "normal" move in professional games is E3. This narrow pincer does not really keep the balance between the opposing 3-4 points.]
;B[gp]C[LL: a rare variation of this "joseki"...

CG: Black has no reason not to play the usual josekis starting with C3 or F5.]
;W[hp]LB[go:B][fq:A];B[fq]C[LL: now, it's no more a "joseki" !

CG: Yes, black must of course play G5.];W[go];B[fp];W[hq];B[cq]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[bo];B[br];W[dn];B[en];W[dm]LB[ho:B][op:A]C[LL: which color is best, now ???

CG: I would prefer white in this position. 
You propose cutting at H5, but this would be too slow - white may even ignore this cut. Depending on the situation (e.g. if white plays A2), black might also prefer the forcing move at G6.]

(;B[op];W[lp]C[LL: a pincer which is also an extension of the white formation...]
;B[qq]LB[pm:B][on:A][qo:C][qq:D]C[LL: [...\] responds with 'a', 'b', 'c'  (...) (joseki).
[...\] 'd' is unfavorable with this pincer, as the pincer is in the way of White's extension.
(Kogo's)

CG: But in this position,white gets over-concentrated, too.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro]LB[on:B][mq:A];B[mq];W[lq];B[mp];W[ln];B[mo]

(;W[lo]C[CG: This is too slow! You should not be afraid of the cut and take the initiative by playing A2 or F7. Even if black gets the opportunity to push through at M5, he can only capture M6.]
;B[cg]LB[jc:B][cj:A]C[CG: Good!]
(;W[cj]C[CG: Now Black D13 has become sente! Playing such a narrow extension in gote is painful. You cannot win if you take the second-best move on each side!

It would have been better not to play M5, but you should still play K17 or R14.]
;B[jc]LB[qf:A][pm:B]C[LL: but, black seems to lead in the development...
what was white mistake ??

CG: As I explained, M5 was the bad move.];W[qf];B[qh]LB[qc:B]
[of:A][ph:C]
(;W[of]C[LL: is this move OK or NOT ??? it seems that white helps black to develop the upper side...

CG: P14 is bad since yo cannot attack R12 efficiently. R17 is better in this case.]
;B[nd]
(;W[ql]C[CG: This is to loose. You should not give black an extension on the side and play R9 instead.]
;B[qj]C[CG: Black should play P12, of course.];W[rd]C[CG: Since you can only get one eye in the corner, you have to move out. And if you have to move out, you should not play S16.

If your group is safe, you would prefer to invade at R17, wouldn't you? S16 is aji-keshi!]
;B[qc];W[ol];B[oi];W[mf]TR[qc][rd]C[CG: The marked exchange is a minus for white.]
;B[ld]TR[ln][go][lo][hp][lp][gq][hq][lq]SQ[rd][mf][of][qf]C[LL: black is now clearly ahead in the game... what was the main problem in white's strategy ???

CG: The triangled stones are over-concentrated (M5!), and the squared stones are running on neutral points (P14!).]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[qb];W[lg]
(;B[mi]C[CG: This is strange. Black should not try to attack the white stones from this direction - this just harms the black moyo. 
I would prefer to calmly live with S8 and either secure the top left or attack with J13.]
;W[ki];B[mk]
(;W[mm]C[CG: This move lacks fighting spirit. I would prefer L9!]
