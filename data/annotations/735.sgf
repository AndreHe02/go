shadow: why save q16 stones or r14 stone at all?  What purpose  do they serve?  the serve the same purpose as N15 stones.  They  cut white off from the middle.  so if you are going to lose N15, why  should you care about Q15 stones as well?  their purpose is lost  and it's only 10 more points gote.
