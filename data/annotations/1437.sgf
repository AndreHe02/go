AB[pd][dp]C[Ecyrd [19k?\]: G'day

Dear reviewer,   this is a game I played on KGS recently.  And lost, even though at one point I thought I was
doing okay.  I have identified a couple of mistakes I realized myself in this file, so any
comments on those would be useful (to see if my own evaluation is correct).

I think my small-scale fighting ability is not terrible (though I can be the victim of an
occasional snapback), but I really feel at loss in the beginning and in the middle game.  Any
tips on how I could improve on those would be very nice =).

Thanks for your time.

Your comments, with one or two exceptions, show pretty good insight into the game. In some cases, what I do is point out how early in the game certain issues are relevant.

I have book in Chinese, which I cannot read, entitled Big Points, Urgent Points. I think about what the book must be saying since I can't read it. In your game, both players missed urgent points by making life and death mistakes. You both also ignored big points, like around C10, in order to make small plays that don't accomplish much. Unfortunately for you, you made the last and biggest of both of these types of mistakes. You really had a very good chance of winning until near the end.

Good luck in your future playing.];W[oj]C[This was a slip by white, but he let it go.]

;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[rd]LB[qe:A][qd:B][ra:C]C[I used to play this move too much myself. It has a nice feel to the shape.
The problem is you have to worry about a w peep at A and what might happen later.
I think B is better. Then you might have to answer w C, but that is not a big problem.]
;W[kb]LB[jc:A][kc:B][ib:C]C[It is not urgent but answering w with a move at A, B, or C would have given you a more comfortable position at the top. Your move is good, but you have to realize that w's move is an attack on your position at the top. If you don't answer it, you have to anticipate weakness here in exchange for strength somewhere else.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[pj]
(;B[ld]C[ajax [17k\]: yes sorry, g'day, oz or kiwi?

I didn't notice this move on the first pass through, but it is questionable. It invites w's next move which leaves him better and you worse. See alternates.]
;W[kc]C[Ecyrd [19k?\]: Melbourne, Australia. But I
Ecyrd [19k?\]: 'm really Finnish.];B[kd];W[lc]C[ajax [17k\]: nz but really a pom

This is bad shape (empty triangle) for w. Nothing you can really exploit, just a wasted move on his part.]
;B[jp];W[pn]C[Ecyrd [19k?\]: pom?];B[np];W[ro];B[rq];W[oe];B[od]
C[This ends up to be a questionable move. It sets off an exchange that weakens your top. A little difficult to see this result in advance.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[md]C[ajax [17k\]: english];B[gp]
C[I think I am playing quite defensively here.  It probably would've
been a better idea to play around D10 instead to gain more territory there?

Yes, I agree. All in all, your position is still pretty good.]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[hb];B[hc];W[ic]
(;B[id]LB[hd:A]C[My first instinct is to like A, but I am not really sure it is better. See alternate line.]

(;B[gd]C[see alternate.];W[hd];B[he];W[fb];B[hc];W[gb];B[ed]
;W[db]TR[mf][me][cf]C[I felt at loss here... White has some area on the top, I have a
black wall.

The territory/wall exchange itself is OK. Your wall, though, is weakened by w's live triangle stones. They make it difficult for you to use the wall for anything and it may get to the point that you have to run for your life here. In view of this, it might would have been better to try for something else at the top.]
;B[mg]LB[df:A][dg:B][eg:C][mj:D][mk:E][nl:F][nm:G][dj:H]C[I was sort of thinking about oozing towards the centre, but probably
it would've been better to start to make a base for the top group or too ooze from that towards
the centre.

This move has the effect of almost forcing w to weaken your wall further. A better direction of play is probably along the lines of A,B, or C. You could press w down, help your top group and get center influence all at the same time. No doubt, one of these moves is better than the other 2, but I don't know which for sure.

Your move might be good if several conditions are met:
1) You can still escape with the top group after w's response. I think this is true.
2) You really get some good center influence out of the move. I don't think this is true.
w's right side group gets in the way. You would get more out of a move like D, E, or F or G. One of these would hurt your top less, lessen the influence of w's right side, and enhance your center more by working with your bottom to map out a large framework. However I still think that helping out the top is more urgent, particularly if w can be made to see it as an attack on his upper left.

Finally a move around H or thereabouts  goes unplayed for most of the game and is maybe as good or better than anything else.]

;B[lp]LB[kq:A]C[ajax [17k\]: prisoner of mother england, aussie convicts

I like A better. Try to get some territory for yourself and make w run to the center.]
;W[mq];B[kq];W[mp]C[Ecyrd [19k?\]: Ah.  Thanks.];B[mo]LB[nq:A]
C[I like A better. You get a base on both sides and let w run to the center. Your move leave too many cutting points and a relatively weak corner.]

[on][oo]C[These moves were aimed at growing a wall so that I could get presence
in the centre.

I would save this peep for later. Your triangle stones are still weak and need a reinforcement at A if you expect to use them for real center influence. See alternate.]

(;W[nj];B[lk];W[kn];B[lr]C[But somehow I realized that the white bottom group wasn't alive yet.]

Ecyrd [19k?\]: no worries

I thought a lot about that move... I was sort of hoping w wouldn't notice how thin the life of
the group is.

He doesn't for a long time.];W[df];B[je];W[ke]LB[hf:A][cj:B]
C[This is w's mistake. It has no value. He should play at A or a big point like B.]
;B[hf];W[gi]C[During most of the rest of my comments, I ignore the significance of this ko. It seems that both players do too until near the end of the game. I think that w has more ko threats, so b needs to play here as soon as possible.

Both players ignore most of the biggest moves for some time from this point on.]
;B[hi];W[gh];B[il]LB[gj:A][fk:B][cj:C]C[Capture these stones on a large scale with something like A or B or play something like C to grab territory on the side. Your move is too small.]
;W[jm];B[kk];W[gm]
(;B[gl]LB[gk:A]C[A is better. You are trying to attack and kill w's weak stones by separating them from the upper strong ones. Usually initial phases of attack work better with non-contact plays. See alternate.]

LB[cj:A]C[A move at around A is big for both sides. Much bigger than many of the last few moves.]
;W[kh]C[I think my next move is probably my single biggest mistake. Instead of
killing an almost dead group, I should've played around C10 to reduce white's area, or to cut
at E8. I was playing too aggressively.  I think I miscounted that I was badly behind.

Yes, those would be better moves and aggressive in a good way. I am not really sure if E8 would work, but C10 is a sure thing and would threaten a working E8.]

;B[ip];W[ir];B[hd]C[There goes my second major screwup.  I somehow thought that my bottom
group is alive, so I tended to the top group.

No, this is right. You just have to play more carefully on bottom now. You are alive if you play it right.]

A is better. When in doubt play on the outside in capturing races to preserve the liberties of the group under attack. But you can still win this race.]

Of course, snap backs are easy to miss in the heat of battle. Probably the key to not missing them, which should help in other situations as well, is to really consider your opponents moves.
