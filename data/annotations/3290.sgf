C[Hi, my name is Klaus. I'm playing blak against the Many Faces of go program in level 9.
 I think I'm somewhere between 20k and 15 k.

 I tryed to point some of my doubts but something that really disturbs me is that i don't have a feeling of how to proceed in the game. I have this feeling that i am playing in wrong general way. Thanks for any help.

Hi Klaus.

My name is Jan-Willem. I am around 10k and I'll try to give you some directions how to improve your game.

The most important advice is: try to play humans instead of computers. Either in real life (but maybe finding players in Brasil is difficult) or at the internet. The reason is that a computer plays a very non-balanced game: in some aspects it's very good, in others it plays horribly. Those bad elements will 'teach' you a bad style.]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[qc];W[dc];B[co];W[dm];B[eo];W[fp];B[cq]LB[em:C]
[eo:B][dp:E][cq:A][dq:D]C[I feel that this shape is not good for me. White will cut me for sure. But I didn't want to lose the corner.

tsjanl:

Firstly: you cannot lose the corner, because you didn't have it in the first place. If the corner is important for you, playing A a move earlier (instead of B) was better. Now that you started to jump out, continuing a move on the outside like C looks better.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[fn]LB[bm:C][eo:A][dr:B]C[tsjanl: As you can see, A has become quite worthless. Trying to save it isn't a good idea. Your two stones will have a difficult time saving themselves.

You are creating what is called a heavy group: a group without a good prospect to create eyes but too big to sacrifice.

It is better to just leave A as 'aji'. Literally that means 'bad taste'. It is a stone that can come to use later and give white a bit of a uncomforable feeling.

My suggestions at this moment would be B or C, because the black group doesn't seem to be safe yet.]
;W[hp];B[dn]C[tsjanl: White's answer shows why this is a bad move. It makes your group even heavier.]
;W[cn];B[en];W[cm];B[dr]C[tsjanl: Do you see the problem? You have created two weak groups that have to fight for their lives.]
;W[er];B[eq];W[ep];B[cr];W[fl];B[gm];W[qj]C[tsjanl: This is the moment Many faces is showing that it is a computer. No human would stop the attack at your weak group at this moment. He would continue to chase your group. You will make no territory at all while on the run, while white will. To ignore this chance is awfull.]
;B[in]C[Maybe f3 would be better? I was afraid of been surrounded.
My following moves gave me a sensation of "running away" that I didn't like.

--

F3 is worse. Of your two groups, F6 is clearly the weakest.

That you have the feeling of running away is correct. You are forced, because you have created a heavy group earlier.]
;W[jq];B[ko];W[fq];B[kq];W[qn];B[on];W[pl];B[ce];W[ch];B[ee]
;W[fd];B[cj]C[tsjanl: this is very dangerous, because the white stones below are quite strong. Because of that you are creating two weak groups yourself on the left side, without getting much compensation.]
;W[bk]C[tsjanl: Again a bad move by the computer.

One go-proverb says that you have to fight from your weak group. White is attacking from it's strong group, pushing you against it's own weak group. Very bad.]
;B[bj];W[eh];B[ff]C[Tsjanl: From the wrong direction. Your C10-group is much weaker, because it can't get into the corner.]
;W[ed];B[bh];W[bg];B[ci]LB[cg:A][ej:B]C[tsjanl: This doesn't help you. It doesn't create eyespace, because white can play A12. It doesn't help you to run out.

I think you have two options: picking a fight with A, or try running out with B.]
;W[cg];B[fh]C[tsjanl: Again, you are playing from your more secure group.]
;W[ck]C[tsjanl: I'll stop commenting on the computer moves, but this one is missing the point completely again.]
;B[ei]C[tsjanl: Good! If you manage to connect the two groups, the tables are turned.]
;W[gl];B[nc]LB[dh:B][fi:A]C[tsjanl: But now you need a follow up. A or B are called for.]
;W[fi];B[dh];W[gi];B[gh];W[go];B[ip]LB[bc:D][jd:C][qh:B][qp:A]
C[tsjanl: What do you win here? Maybe a few points. The marked points a so much bigger.]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[iq]C[???];B[hl];W[ej];B[eg];W[jp]LB[im:A]C[tsjanl: Taking the stone with A gives you a very strong position.]
;B[kp];W[ao];B[bp];W[jl];B[il];W[cd];B[be];W[ic];B[qf]LB[qg:A]
[qh:B]C[tsjanl: This is too close to your two stones above. I would play A or even B.]
;W[lc];B[nf]LB[qp:A]C[tsjanl: A is biggest now, because that corner is still open.]
;W[ap];B[aq];W[bn];B[br];W[np];B[nn];W[jk];B[kr];W[oq];B[pq]
;W[ml];B[hj]LB[ro:A]C[tsjanl: Small. I would play something like A, because it starts securing the corner.]
;W[hi];B[ij];W[jh]
(;B[is]LB[bc:A][ro:B]C[Would h1 be better? I didn't want wite to make that much territory in the botton. Perhaps it is too soon for this since it is usualy a yose move. Are there bigger moves?

tsjanl: You are right. (The biggest moves are often in the corner.)]
;W[rp]C[tsjanl: Jump between this and the variation and see how big the difference is.]
;B[rq];W[po];B[oo];W[gn];B[kf]LB[op:A]C[Maybe I should have defended with f7? I was trying to make a lot of influence because a friend of mine told me that playing for territory is the key to defeat a program.

tsjanl: I think a stone at A is the most important. Maybe objectively it isn't needed, but because we are inexperienced players and a computer is excellent in fighting, your lower right corner is in big danger.]
;W[ro];B[ii];W[hh];B[ih];W[nk];B[hg];W[fj];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[ie]LB[op:A]C[j15 seems small.

tsjanl: Still A.];W[kn];B[jo];W[mn];B[mo];W[fm];B[im];W[jn]
;B[io];W[jg];B[ig];W[nm]
(;B[no]C[This is ugly. Maybe m6 instead? I didn't want to lose territorry in the botton.

tsjanl: P4 still is needed. That also protects the cut. See the variation.]

;W[ac];B[ae];W[qh];B[qg];W[pi];B[de];W[pr];B[qr];W[na];B[oa]
;W[or];B[op]C[Tsjanl: finally!];W[ma];B[ob];W[mh];B[og]C[This looks bad for me. Maybe p12?]
;W[dj];B[di];W[mf];B[me];W[ng];B[lf]LB[ne:A]C[A is more needed.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[bb];B[mg];W[nh];B[oe];W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[jr]
;W[hq];B[mc];W[lb]C[Here I still had some hope of winning. But then I  lost many points.]
;B[kd]LB[sh:A][ln:B]C[tsjanl: in the end game the concept of sente is very important. Find the moves your opponent has to answer. I have marked some examples.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb];B[ld];W[lh];B[sp];W[qp];B[qq];W[so];B[sq]
;W[pn];B[mp]C[tsjanl: this is bad. It is not needed, so it is a stone in your own territory.]
;W[om];B[ln];W[lm];B[mm];W[jm];B[ll];W[mn];B[bo]LB[jb:A][ri:B]
C[tsjanl: Two ko threaths that really make a difference.];W[lo]
C[tsjanl: When you make a ko threath, and don't follow it up, it's better not to play it at all.]
;B[lp];W[an];B[ln];W[mm];B[jd]LB[sh:A][ak:B][es:C]C[tsjanl: A is the biggest, because it is sente. B and C are big too.]
;W[gm];B[dd];W[cb];B[sh]C[tsjanl: Yes!];W[si];B[sg];W[rj];B[oh]
;W[oi];B[lg]C[tsjanl: Not sente and small...];W[aj]C[tsjanl: so white takes the last big point.]
;B[ai];W[ak];B[fs]C[I don't know why I did this.

tsjanl: well, we all make these kinds of mistakes when we start.]
;W[es];B[ds];W[lo];B[fr]C[tsjanl: useless, and a wasted ko threath.]
;W[eq];B[ln];W[of];B[pf];W[gk]C[tsjanl: the computer knows that in the end game a point is bigger than a ko.]
;B[rn]C[I think s6 was useles, and I just gave points to white. I was hopping to make a litle territory ( it didn't work :)

This really loses a point, because white doesn't have to answer it.]
;W[lo];B[fc];W[ec];B[ln];W[kg];B[lo];W[id];B[sn];W[qo];B[qm]
;W[pm];B[rm];W[hk]C[tsjanl: there is no reason to connect two living groups.]
;B[ik];W[gj];B[ql];W[ho];B[qk];W[pk];B[sk];W[tt];B[sj];W[ri]
;B[rk];W[sl]C[Dead. :(  Was there a way to make it live, or was it realy a  lost cause?

tsjanl: there was not enought room or white weaknesses to take advantage of.]
;B[oj]C[From here on I was just playing to see what would happen.]
;W[pj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[lj];B[tt];W[lk];B[tt];W[tt]C[The end, white wins by 12,5.
 I would apreciate any hints  or general suggestion.
