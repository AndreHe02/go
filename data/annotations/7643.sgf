C[Hi MichaÃ«l.
Your main concern here is how to get a feeling for the 19x19 board, especially in the opening.
You also have a tendency to play in a too passive way, to defend when you should be trying to take lead. Still, it's a very good game for someone who's been playing for a week, keep that in mind while reading my comments ;-)

A good reading for you at that point would be "opening theory made easy", if you can get your hands on it. Also, have a look at the most classical joseki at http://brugo.be/joseki2.php
Don't learn them by heart, just have a quick look to get an idea at how approach moves in the corner can be played, and try out some of the positions in your games.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask me.];B[pd]
C[Opening with a standard joseki i learn at sensei's library.]
;W[cp];B[nq]TR[po][qo][op][pp][qp][oq][pq][qq]C[Well, that last move certainly isn't standard. It's too far from the corner. It's not unplayable, but certainly above my own level. The marked places are the standard moves in the corner.
I don't say you shouldn't try out things, but you should be aware that starting out this way makes for a complicated life against an opponent strong enough to take advantage of it.]
;W[ce];B[qp]C[You see, the consequence of you moving to O3 rather than P3 means this position is unsafe and your corner could be invaded by white.]
;W[di]
(;B[qf]C[Here you seem to be afraid of playing on the side because white could play at R14 instead. You needn't be. See variation. Although it would be better to play at Q10 or R10 instead than P10 as in your variation. When you play on the fifth line, you're too far from the side of the board so you give your stone no base. You don't make a bigger territory this way. Although you enclose a bigger space, it also means it can be easily invaded.]
;W[dc];B[oj]C[As I said earlier, that stone is too high. Also, you would be better off making an approach move in white's are of influence, for example on E3 or E4. You're keeping away from the opponent, allowing him to build solid positions that will be hard to attack later. That's what I meant earlier with "too passive".]
;W[ep];B[jp];W[jc];B[md]C[That move doesn't protect the corner (white can play under you) and it doesn't put much pressure on the white stones either. To protect the corner, you should play Q18 or Q17. But I would much rather try and invade the growing white area, maybe at G17 or at D7.]
;W[gc];B[hq];W[fl]TR[qc][qj][pq]C[Before I got to this point my focus had been on developing the sides and walls.

Yeah, but you didn't develop them in a very good way. Although it might be hard for you at this point to see the difference, white's position is much safer than yours. A few places where I would try to invade, would I be your opponent...]
;B[jm]C[Here I make my first move torward the middle.];W[kg]
(;B[mg]C[The attack hurt a lot, I think i Should have attacked the center from he top instead so he didn't gain so much territory


He didn't gain anything yet. It's very hard to surround territory in the middle. Don't panick too fast and once again, try not to be too passive. A good way to do this is think "how can I hurt him as much or more as he hurts me?". He gets something but you get something too. See variation.]
;W[jk];B[kk]C[playing defensively, trying to keep white out of my territory

It's too defensive. You can already see that if you play this way, you will get some territory but white will get more. If you only defend, you have no chance to win. You have to switch to attack. And the longer you wait, the tougher it'll be, because white strenghtens his position with every move.]
;W[li];B[mi];W[mj];B[nj];W[lk];B[kl]C[Getting locked into a battle because I lost sente

As I said, the best way to avoid that is attack earlier.];W[nk]
;B[kj];W[lj];B[ki]C[trying to devide his stones];W[ll];B[lm]
;W[mm];B[on]C[Containment, he's going to live to make the aread as small as possible


You haven't cut him out yet (you would need to play on M12 to achieve that).]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[nn];B[no];W[mo]C[That group's alive, by the way.]
;B[ln];W[mn];B[mp];W[mb]C[Here you can see white taking advantage of your earlier move on O16. You can see that it doesn't actually protects anything.]
;B[nb];W[ck];B[ii]C[attacking his territory];W[gn];B[hg];W[ih]
(;B[po]C[developing thickness

That's not developing thickness, put protecting. It would have been better to do it earlier.]
;W[gi];B[hh];W[qc];B[pc]C[block on the wider side and heep from connecting]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[rc];B[qd];W[ra];B[pa]C[Nicely played :-)];W[lh]
;B[mh];W[hi];B[ig];W[jh];B[jf]C[my stones will die if i don't connect them and then i won't be able to further attack the center]
;W[kf];B[kh];W[jg];B[je];W[ji];B[hn]C[Better to connect at L16 for now. Then play something more offensive, for example at H8 or at G15.]

Yeah, but your black group up there still isn't safe at all. This things should'nt keep you from looking at the whole board ^^]

You do :-)

But your opponent could have put you in a lot more trouble, and the reason is mainly your moves in the opening, and your tendency to follow your opponent around rather than look at the situation on the whole board. You should work on that.]
