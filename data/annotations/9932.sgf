C[Hello,
Eventhough I won this game, a review would be extremly helpful, since it was only a win by time and my opponent was ahead the whole time. So it was only by luck that I could win.
There was some weird joseki choice by my opponent in the lower right corner. After the game I tried to look this variation up but couldn't find information on that: Feels like I've made a mistake there...

{c}
Hi. I'm Cooper. AGA 4d. That was an interesting game. I'm really impressed by your fighting spirit... you were way behind but you managed to make a really hard invasion work for you and got back in the game. You could have even won if not for your move 222. 

hope review is helpful.

some important points:

{coop} this is called micro-chinese ( usually black exchanged A for B first. ) quite common... but usally you see it with A and B there.]
;W[po]C[{c} good];B[qm];W[qq];B[pp]C[{c} this is usually a bad idea for black.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr]C[{c} this is good];B[qr]C[Now this is where I'm lost. R2 for black isn't suggested by any joseki page. I lived in the corner, but very small and black got a lot of influence for that, so I think I must have made a mistake. How should white respond to this?]
;W[rr];B[qs]
(;W[or];B[rq];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[nq]C[After O 3, I decided to bring out the cutting stone at Q 5. I think this was a mistake, since black will be able to get stronger more quickly than white. But I am not sure where to play for white instead. Maybe M3, and eventually force black to kill off the cutting stone, or just tenuki completly?

{c} this result is good for you. 10 points in the corner for white and blacks groups are both weak. if you don't feel like brig]
;W[oo]
(;B[oq];W[mo];B[nr];W[rs]LB[qm:B][nr:A]C[black has 2 groups without a base - he can only protect one. your plan should be to attack whichever one he doesn't defend.]
;B[kq]
(;W[nm]C[{c} this is where i think you went wrong - this is too slow. you are thinking that your stones are weak but they are out in the center... they are hard to attack and b is in fact the weak one. see variations]
;B[pj]C[{c} black gets to protect both and build a big moyo on the top right. this is too good for black]

(;W[hq]LB[iq:A]C[{c} should be one closer to B to put pressure his group still isn't alive. this seems like a small point. but it makes a big diffference in the fighting. in situations like this always play at A to reduce eye space and keep maximum pressure on opponent]
;B[mk];W[jp]LB[mk:A]C[Going for the surround now, but not sure if that was worth a lot...

;W[gr];B[is];W[lq]C[This was probably a mistake too, removing aji from the position. But I thought I could hane at O1 to make that eye false, but only after having played M 3 I noticed that it doesn't work.

{c} yes. this kind of thing makes a big difference some times. definitely try to break this habit]
;B[lr];W[ln]LB[pj:A][hq:B]C[{c} overall you sealed black in but sadly in gote. black is doing pretty well now because of B getting A and white only playing at B ( which made the seal gote)]
;B[ci];W[ck]C[Pushed away from thickness, but I thought this was one of the rare cases where it is actually ok to do so. Feels quite impressive, having the low chinese with that framework, at least that was my thought.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fc]LB[cf:A]C[{c} you should consider gonig high here to help attack the A group and to make it easier to reduce black's moyo]

(;W[ei]LB[ff:A][qh:C][pi:B][qk:D]C[Maybe it was too quickly to start attacking now? But I really wanted to use that influence somehow. Instead of E 11 I also debated A and B. But after A white just jumps to E 11, and if feels like white achieved nothing. And B would give black the opportunity to defend himself before white attacks. But maybe getting 2 moves at B area is already enough profit...
Should white have attacked now, if yes, how. And if no, where else to play?

{c} this move looks ok -- but i would worry about losing sente - if black gets another move in the top right it will be very hard to deal with. so i would invade right away. your move at B looks interesting if you read out some sequences that would be good... more normal would be C (which looks at the weak spot at D.

--- also just about this shape itself. looks funny see simple variatin for B to ruin this shape]

C[Is K 17 better here? Or is the white "wall" just to weak to allow any kind of attack at the moment?

{c} yes. white doesn't have a wall. he has a weak group. any attack is bad right. white needs to escape
in particular this exchange makes it harder for white to make an eye around A if he needs to later]

(;W[li]LB[cc:A][bf:B]C[{c} i think you have to play more aggressively here -- try to get some forcing moves against the A group before rescueing this group.

let me explain why it is important to do that. -- if you keep black group on the left weak the invasion on A will be hard or you may even get to play B in sente and take the big corner.... BUT if the black group on the left gets strong the invasion at A will be easy and very hard for white to deal with.]
