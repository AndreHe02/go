C[Mark: Thanks in advance for reviewing this game.  My major concerns are the reduction of the top (starting with move 145) and my work to make life in the center (starting with move

N: Hi, I play as Numsguil (3k) on KGS.  I've prefaces my comments with N so you can tell who said what.]

;B[ec];W[gc]TR[df][de]C[N: Either triangle would be my move.  If black makes a base you can kick him to make him overconcentrated, so a pincer isn't necessary strictly speaking.]
;B[ee]
(;W[cf]C[N: You already know the better move here ;)];B[fg]
(;W[ef]C[Mark: So clearly, my focus here is on cutting, killing, and getting a huge corner.  I believe this is too optimistic.  I have some ideas in the variations.

N: I know you probably had second thoughts after this move about the cut, but this sort of exchange is just terrible if you don't follow up with the cut.  It just strengthens black.  You didn't really get any compensation from it at all, and if anything your top stones ended up weaker by the end.]
;B[ff]
(;W[df];B[fd];W[db]TR[fi]C[Mark: Again, my focus here is to make the black group float.  However, I do not know if this is reasonable given the running room it has.

N: You're better off chasing the weak black group.  If he dives in to the corner, so be it.  I'd have a different opinion if this was a 4-4 stone corner instead, but the 3-4 has good claim on the corner already, so this move is a tad redundant.

The cap at triangle instead is much better.  It drives black to the right, and you can build up a bit of a wall facing down black's moyo in the process.]
;B[ge];W[gd]TR[fi]C[Mark: This does not help me much --- I'm just working to make a false eye.  I think it's bigger to approach a corner.

N: This is basically a pass.  The cap at triangle is still good.  Invading black's moyo is also good.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pn]LB[fq:A]TR[po][qp]C[Mark: And now I have approached the toughest remaining corner.  I think a move at A is easier and makes use of the stones above on the left.

N: You're not supposed to attach to weak stones, because it makes them stronger.  But what about if you're going in to an area where you're outgunned?  Attaching can be a useful way to build up momentum.  See variation]
;B[ql];W[pl]C[Mark: Starting here and up to move 84 is where I want advice.  I survive (which is good), but I am wondering how much I sacrifice in doing so.  Also, some of my moves seem heavy (like 28) and I am wondering what alternatives I have.

N: Attaching to black's stones is good here.  He's already strong so you don't need to worry about strengthening him.]
;B[qm]
(;W[pm]C[N: Unfortunately playing steady moves like this inside a moyo just makes you heavy, so this isn't great.]
;B[qn];W[qk];B[pk];W[qh]C[N: Do you have time to take profit?  (Hint: no, you do not).]
;B[ml];W[mm]C[N: Good, keep attaching to stuff];B[nm];W[nl]
;B[nn]
(;W[ol]C[N: You have no shape and you've made yourself heavy.  I'd sacrifice the 3 white stones to build up some strength instead.  See variation for my off-the-cuff idea.]

;B[mh];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[qp];W[cn]LB[fq:A]C[Mark: This appears slow --- I am attempting to expand from a stable group.  Is it better to move at 3-3 or at A here?

N: 3-3 isn't good.  Black would just turn the whole right side into territory.  A probably isn't good because black still has forcing moves against your last invasion.  So you'd be facing a solid wall of black stones, which is never good.

This move is probably fine locally.];B[jn];W[lk];B[jo];W[lj]
;B[en];W[fq]TR[dl]C[N: Bad idea.  You're deep in to black's moyo again.  I'd simply play triangle.  Black's corner still needs defending after you defend yourself.  And if you can get this last exchange in sente that's pretty good isn't it?  The game is even enough that there's no reason to push your luck just yet.]

TR[do]C[N: You have to cut at triangle.  If black connectes, you're in deep trouble.]

;B[bk];W[fi]LB[bh:A]TR[mc]C[Mark: Wrong direction -- at the least I think A is better at threatening the black group.

N: I think the top is bigger (ie: around triangle).  As long as your white group here can connect out, it's good enough since black gave you the corner.]

;B[kc]
(;W[kd]C[Mark: And this leads to me losing some of the top --- frustrating, since I thought I could claim it all.  Advice here would be appreciated --- can I kill this stone?

N: It might be killable, but I'm not sure I see a way either.  The problem stems from the fact that your stones to the left aren't independently alive.  They need to connect out to live.  They're overloaded trying to protect territory AND stay connected.]
;B[ic]TR[jc]C[N: Punch him in the face.  Triangle cuts him in two.  He gets two white stones, you protect the rest of your territory.]

;W[qn];B[rp];W[rj]C[N: Maybe something like this?  There's probably better sequences you can find online.  The trick is to play in such a way that if black attacks your weaknesses you can get some forcing moves in.  The goal isn't to make all the stones live.  Just make some stones somewhere live, or at least get decent compensation somewhere.  Most of the first stones you put down will probably die.]

(;W[fe]C[N: I think the cut works, actually.  At least, it separates black's stones.  I probably wouldn't play this just yet, but keep it in my pocket for later, as it can strengthen black's stones.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hc];W[de];B[ed];W[gi]C[N: Something like this maybe.  Black will probably live on the top, but now you have power to stare down his moyo.]

(;W[cb]C[Mark: Take the corner.

N: I'm not much of a fan of this.  There is some profit, and it does put pressure on black's group, but it's too slow IMO.]

(;W[dh]C[Mark: Take more of the side and set up the cut.
