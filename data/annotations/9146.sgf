AB[pd][dp][pp]C[hi , first of all thanks for agreeing to review my game and i hope you will help me.

im a player that usually play well if the game is not complicated , and i also try to keep it simpe usually.
but some times the "right plays" in my opinion require me to make the game complicated or perhaps its my strategy that forces me to make it complicated.

in this game i played as black, and it became game with many groups and complicated fighting.
i would like you to help me see where i went wrong , how perhaps i could have kept the game simple and how i should have managed my groups.

also it would be nice if you were to tell me what do i lack to get to 3-4 dan level (based on this game and my thinking while playing it)

forfun (hereafter ff) - Hi mythical! Thanks for giving us an interesting game. Let's see what we can make of it.

My main impression is that Black is a little too one-sided in always wanting to play severe moves. This is good (and necessary) up to a point. However, not every attack succeeds, nor should we expect it to. Rather we should always be thinking, "OK, if this guy lives, what have I achieved in the mean time?" This means we should make sure we grasp the overall position and leave ourselves with good potential at the end of any local fight. In this game Black missed a couple of good opportunities to do just that. In the end the fighting continued until White had poked quite a few holes into Black's positions. Finally White was able to turn the tables on Black.

I think that Black's best chance to change the course of the game into a much easier path was at 68. Black should have hemmed the two White stones in from the left side. A similar issue came up in the bottom left corner. Again Black should have played to force White to live in the corner while taking outside thickness. This would have simplified the game and left Black with the initiative.

I have left a mess of variations in the file related to the ko that could have developed in the lower left when Black captures the upper left. Feel free to ignore or explore, as you like. :-)]
;W[dc];B[de];W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[fc]
(;B[cc];W[db]C[ff - See the previous variation. At the pro level this is a very rare variation when Black hasn't already played F14. White does not gain much in the corner and Black's stone at G16 has much more potential.]
;B[cf];W[cb];B[bc];W[nc]C[ff - An overplay in this situation when we look at pro games. White can not leave such a big gap due to the bad potential in the upper left. In the more common joseki where White plays D18 at E17, we can find some examples of this White approach. Black often pincers the approach stone.]

(;B[lc]C[this move of mine for example.
my strategy here is that i want to make use of my G16 stone (since W's top left group is not that strong) , and in my opinion is the "right play" but as you will see it will bring some complicated figthing.
defending my corner with something like Q14/R14 would make it less complicated but it will also give W the chance to fix his top position.
perhaps you will have some insight here.

ff - Trying to take advantage of White's weakness directly is a good, positive approach. Since it is a 3-stone game, Black could also play calm reply in the corner. Right now the bottom and right are wider than the top.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[i wonder , defending my corner and keeping W's group weak is the "ok" strategy here , but what if instead...

ff - I don't like this choice. It seems to contradict Black's strategy with M17. There is no good reason to consider White's stones to be weak. They are stonger than Black's M17 so far. See the second and third variations here...]

(;W[ic]C[ff - Actually this is a strange looking move since Black can easily hit on top at J16. Probably Black got lucky here. But it is not really obvious what White should play instead. The position on the top is clumsy for White.]

(;B[le]C[is M15 the right move/strategy here? helping my stone while trying to keep his group weak seems like the right idea. 

ff - Absolutely, time to go! :-)];W[ng];B[ph];W[lg]C[can you please show me what are my options here? how can i settle my group with good shape without giving W too much? is there a way for me to cut him or gain advantage here?

ff - This is the wrong question. This is such a basic move that if Black did not have a plan for dealing with it Black should not have considered playing R17 and Q12! :-) 

I make it kind of joke, but it is a very serious point. From the point where Black decided to play M17, splitting the top, a fight was coming. It is not enough to think that we'll just solve it when it happens. It is necessary to have a reasonable play for solving the challenge. Otherwise Black should have played something like K16 instead of M15.]
;B[md]C[aji-keshi?

ff - Yes, it is difficult to image how this would not be sente later in any fighting on the top. So there seems no need for it right now. At the same time, it is not obvious what Black might want to play instead, so consider it a minor infraction. :-)]
;W[nd];B[je]
(;W[ie]C[ff - This seems to just help Black. But the aji of G16 seems to make it hard for White to play more aggressively.]
;B[kg];W[lh];B[if];W[he];B[jd];W[ge];B[jc];W[ib];B[lf]C[i think i wasnt sad with this result , it seemed like i made some good shape here.

ff - Black has done well, although White has covered the original weakness at the top while taking a few points in territory. Black can look forward to N14 in the future.]
;W[qj];B[oi]C[here i was thinking that shouldn't touch any of his groups to keep both his stone and group weak and see how game continues.]
;W[ni]C[ff - If White has to respond like this, probably R10 was unreasonable.]
;B[nj];W[mi]C[ff - Terrible shape for White.];B[oj]C[ff - Black gets much better shape out of this exchange than White does. Note that N14, O14, N15 destroys any eye shape here.]
;W[qn]C[defending my corner here seemed like passive idea , and not attacking and using my top group's strenght would be a waste right? so attacking looked like the only strategy here.]

(;B[pn];W[po];B[oo];W[qo];B[op];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq]
(;B[qr]C[ff - This accepts gote for very little gain. See the variation.]

(;W[rh]C[here i was wondering if i should defend top right corner , but i felt its too small and i wouldnt be able to kill his group anyways - so defending top right is defending small space in gote right?

ff - Yes and S12 was not necessary for White to live so the timing seems wrong. I think Black's judgment was better than White's here.]

(;B[cn]C[it seemed like the right idea but perhaps i should have played move like F3 instead?

ff - Black can not cover everything. Black should be comfortable fighting in front of the wall on the right so this seems reasonable.]
;W[jq];B[hq]C[ff - The natural direction.];W[mq]
(;B[lr]C[ff - The big question. Can Black kill White either here or at the top through a splitting attack? If not, this move is too low and too early. If it does not work, this is just a 2nd-line play that earns few or no points. See the variations...]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[jr];B[kq];W[kp];B[mr];W[jo];B[ip];W[jp];B[mo]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[lp];B[nq];W[fq]C[here comes the mess  :)

ff - Note that the mess comes because the previous plays starting with M2 have strengthened the White stones (although they do not have eyes) and weakened Black's.

Black should carefully consider now what the strategy should be. Black would like to pressure the weak group in the upper right, the weak group in the bottom, and the single stone on the left side. There are already enough targets available to win the game. Black does not have to work hard to create another one.]

(;B[gp];W[fp];B[fo];W[dq]
(;B[cq]C[ff - Is there a problem if White plays more aggressively? See the variation on the next White move and the variation for Black here...]

(;W[ep]
(;B[dr]C[ff - Although this is a strong play, attacking White's eye-shape, it allows White to greatly complicate the game by breaking through at E5. Black ends up in danger of not making enough territory to win.]
;W[eo];B[fn];W[en];B[fm]
(;W[er]C[ff - A big chance for Black - remember the Strategy!]

(;B[eq]C[ff - This ko has no role to play in the strategy. Black misses a chance and the game becomes difficult step by step.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[em];B[fl];W[co];B[bo];W[cm]
(;B[bn];W[dk]
(;B[kn]C[at this point i felt i should start attacking , and i did it right in the key point.
but looking back , should i perhaps make my own group stronger before attacking?

ff - This is indeed a key shape point. However, since White has no eyes at all yet, Black did not have to be so severe. Attacking from a distance would give White less opportunity to seek complications.]
;W[jn];B[kl];W[jl]
(;B[jk]C[ff - This is not such a good idea unless Black is confident of killing the top. It pushes White toward the weaker Black stones and 'forces' White to protect the peep at J7.]
;W[il];B[kj];W[ik];B[fj];W[jj];B[kk];W[gk];B[el];W[dl];B[ej]
;W[bg]C[what an interesting strategy by W , this made me very confused , especially on what should my strategy be right now? so many things to do.]
;B[fg];W[dg];B[df];W[gi]C[another interesting idea by W...
what should i be thinking now?

ff - Don't push your opponent toward your own weak stones when attacking next time? :-) In this game there are no general rules left. Now you fight.]
;B[fh];W[ji];B[dj];W[cj];B[ci];W[di]C[my reading was not that great here , perhaps you can show me the ways to kill something here , preferably the D12 stones (if its possible)

ff - See the variation on the next move. Black missed a (last?) chance.

It is less clear that this is bad. Note how close N4 is to the P4 wall. This approach leaves a gap between L4 and H4.
