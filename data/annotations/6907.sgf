C[hi and thanks for reviewing my game.

im trying for a long time now to reach dan level (was 3k for about a year+) and hopefully you can help me here.
what i would like to see is how you (dan player) think compared to me (kyu player) and what i am still missing in my game.

so besides showing me my mistakes i hope that you can also show me how do you think about any situation.


in this game i played as Black.

df: overall, I think you made the game easy for white by giving him a big framework on the upper side.  You made an overplay and let him capture the lower elft corner.  At this point he was winning.  He let you get thick in the center so you caught up.  Then you made some slow endgame moves and he won.]
;B[pd];W[ec]C[here this move usually confuses me ,  since i am not sure how to react to it , so im thinking to play a move at lower left corner and later aproach upper left corner (approaching the top left corner now is probably not a good idea)

df: taking the lower left is good.  Just be aware that this move intends to make a wall facing right on the upper edge, so play yor openeing to make that wall small.]
;B[cp]SQ[dp]C[i probably should've played D4 here , since that way it would be easier to approach top left corner.

df: this is fine too.];W[fp]C[this move confused me too , i was not sure now what would be my next move , what is the biggest point right now?
should i just defend the corner,pincer or take the other corner

df: I would just take the last corner.  This more is not close to your corner, so you don't have to answer it.  Generally the corners are bigger, so you should take a corner unless you have a really good reason not to.]
;B[hq];W[np]
(;B[pp]C[df: since he played a nonstandard move, you should think about which joseki will arise after your move (with a different move order).  Playing on 4-4 gives him a double approach to your corner, which is good for him.  Other moves transpose into more advantagous joseki.]
;W[pn]C[df: I like coming out and separating white.  if he comes in at 3-3, you can choose the direction and make some thickness facing your 4-4 stone.  this is good for you, since your stone on the lower side won't get in too much trouble.  Taking the corner yourself will give white a lot of outside thickness.  If white gets thick, your 4-4 point stone is damaged.

You started at 4-4.  This means you want to play long extensions on the adjacent edges, and play for thickness or a moyo.  His move in the upper left limits the upper side.  When yuo let him get the outside in the lwoer right, it limits the right side.]

(;B[qq]C[i think p 5 or any other move here would make the situation good for W , so i went for the corner teritory.

df: I would come out and take the right edge, to be consistent with your 4-4 opening.]
;W[nn];B[kq]C[defending my weak stone and seperating W's two groups.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[pincer heredoesnt seems big to me so i just defended.

df: this is ok, but be aware that white will immediately get a big framework on the upper edge.]
;W[kd]
(;B[cd]C[df: this helps white make a big upper side, so you should think about the other approach.]
;W[df];B[de];W[ee]
(;B[cf]C[df: this helps white make a perfect wall on the upper side.  You should consider the alternative.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[cj];W[dd];B[ce];W[cc]C[df: this white move is slow, so you have a chance now to counter this wall.]
;B[dj]LB[ne:a]C[was my move the biggest?

i thought about invading top , since it can become huge if W plays move like "a" , and if he does it will be dificult to reduce it.

i also thought about playing at "a" myself but wasnt sure if it's big enough .

what would you have done here?

df: I like your move.  If you don't play here, white will make his wall even longer.  If you build some thickness here, you can attack the F4 stone.  O15 looks small.  If you had a framework of your own on the right side, o15 would be on the junction, expanding yours and reducing his.  But you do not have a framework, so O15 does nothing for you.  If yuo want to reduce his side I would start at J14 or K14.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[ei];B[el];W[gk]
(;B[ne]C[now i have no choice but to try and reduce his top.

df: if you can capture the F4 stone your territory competes well with his upper side, but it's difficult.  If he lives and you get thick around H6, you can attack the lower right stones to move into the center, and reduce his upper side while attacking. I would look for some more active alternative to your reducing move, since it is a small reduction, and he doesn't have to answer it.

capturing this stone is unlikely, but getting some outside thickness and making it live small is still good.  Your attack should end with you sente, so you can still reduce later.]

(;W[en]TR[dl][cl][ck][dk][bi][ci]C[this move tells me my corner could be in trouble , also he might conect or use somehow my aji at triangle area.]
;B[fm]C[instead of defending my corner i try to surround his stones, cut him from his allied stones (i think if i just defend it would be too passive)

df: good];W[hp]
(;B[gq];W[gp]
(;B[ip]C[is F3 better? i played j4 because i wanted to attack later the group on the right so my thought is that this move might help me later.]
;W[io]
(;B[jo]C[df: this looks like an overplay since you corner is weak.]

(;B[cr];W[bo];B[bp]C[df: this is bad result in the corner since your group can be killed and white is out and solid.]
;W[im]C[df: you need another move in the corner.]
(;B[hl]C[this move was probably mistake (had no time to read it out)]

(;W[fn]C[fortunately W didnt read it out either and he gave me the chance to fix my mistake and save my stone (the stone itself is not important but it does helps me reduce his center)]
;B[hk]
(;W[ds]
(;B[cs]C[my first mistake here is that i didnt answered by playing at a2 or b2 , my second mistake is that i didnt saw this group is dead (usually i defend weak groups in time) this game i was probably too busy thinking about his center teritory.

df: the group is just as dead after a2 or b2.  since the group is dead already you should save these moves for ko threats.]
;W[ap];B[aq];W[br];B[dn];W[dm];B[bn];W[co];B[gj]C[looking on it now this move is really small , should've probably attacked the W group on the right.

df: no, this move is really big. since it makes you thick in the center.  Earlier white gave you territory for a wall, and now you have eliminated the influence of that wall.]

;W[oq];B[rp];W[ro];B[pr];W[or];B[rr];W[lr];B[lq];W[mq];B[kr]
;W[pb]C[df: the game is close now, so you just need to play well in the endgame.]
;B[ld]C[is this move ok? i didnt saw better move locally , except perhaps something like R18.

what would you have done on top?];W[lc];B[kc];W[jd];B[mc];W[lb]

(;B[lj]C[df: this doesn't look right.  it is much easier for white to come into the center from the top, since the gap is wider and your adjacent groups are weaker.  This move should be at the top.]
;W[kg]C[df: you should try not to answer white everywhere in the endgame. He keeps picking up points in sente.  Try to counter his move with a move of similar size elsewhere to keep the balance.]

(;B[mg]C[df: b18 is really large.  If you can find a way to play here in sente then go b18, or just play there now, it might be better. A move around here is pretty big too though.]

(;B[qp])
(;B[po]C[df: this move is interesting.  If he plays Q3, it's the same as if he started at Q3 and you approached.  In this corner, since you are on 4-4 in the upper right, if the corner is empty, when he starts on Q3, it is clearly a mistake for him, since it gives yuo this good extension from your upper right.  If you get Q3, you take a big corner, and O4 is too close.

The way to find a move like this is to visualize the ordinary joseki in this corner that have a white move at O3, and see if you can play another move from that joseki that will later transpose.]
