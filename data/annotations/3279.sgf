C[HI, my name is aaron.  i lost this game big, so i was wondering how i could have protected my self better than i should have.

I have added alot of variation in the top left, and some variations around at different points. Browse this game with the editing tools open :)

Hope my comments help you improve. For go terms you do not know, there is http://senseis.xmp.net, for other questions feel free to mail me or send me a message on KGS.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[dj];W[nc];B[jd];W[qf];B[qc]C[Up until this move, everything was normal. This move does nothing useful, what you should be playing is P15, to secure access to the center. If locked in you will have a hard time living even with R17 there, and if you live regardless, it secures so little territory that almost any other move is better.]
;W[oe]C[A bit agressive from white here];B[qn]C[At this point you HAVE to defend the upper right corner. White can easilly kill there now, or if he lets you live, gain a whole lot of influence/territory on the right while destroying your influence/territory on the top.

It is painful to make defensive moves at this point, as it is what white would want you to do, but after P15 you really have no choice. Making a defensive move here is "honte", the lesser of two evils, and the move that respects your opponent.]
;W[np];B[rp];W[od]C[White ignores the lower right corner and takes the (bigger) uper right instead. You now have followups at r3 and r10 to consider]
;B[qq];W[pe]C[Unnecesarry by white, you're well dead here, and this move is an effective pass.]
;B[qd]C[Also unnecesarry, white can kill you with Q18, S15 or S18]

(;W[pq];B[pk]C[good move, you're strong in the bottom right corner, and whites top strenght is too far away to effectively attack, a fourth line extension is fine here,]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pn];B[qh]C[Another big point, limits whites strenght, and with the aji in the corner it is probably sente.]
;W[qi]C[Be satsified with cutting white off from his strength here, play Q12]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[pj];W[rh];B[ri]C[Doesn't do anything but possibly waste a later ko threat or endgame move.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[rj];B[rk];W[re]C[White is overly careful here, t11 is fine.]
;B[rd]C[This shouldn't work];W[hc]C[i thought i handled this varley bad.


<W> the previous or the following? The previous was pretty bad yes, swapping a big corner for a smaller one, but on the side you gained lots of good thickness towards the center for relatively little territorial loss.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[id]C[Again you get good thickness towards the center for a loss in territory. The conventional wisdom is that letting your opponent get third line territory (like this) is good if you get the other side of the wall.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[gc];B[fe]C[This move is missplaced, and seem to try to do everything at once; back up the corner, connect all your groups, block white off from the center etc. Multipurpose moves is good, but this stone just does not handle any of the purposes effectively. Since white didn't answer your S16 move, a good move here is L18, attacing the K17 group, at the same time that it threatens life in the corner.]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[cc]C[These moves were bad by white. He strenghtened you alot, and gained little in return.]
;W[kd]
(;B[kb]C[They say you should extend from a crosscut, but it's not true alot of the time, and is meant mostly as a proverb to make you consider other moves than the atari. But here the cut effectively kills you, and you should give the stone up for more outside influence, playing L15]
;W[ld];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp]C[I think E6 is more urgent here. You have some extreme influence over the left, and the while side+center might be made into a moyo]
;W[en];B[dl];W[cg]C[this too, i think that i was just too open to attack, but i thought i was safe, and that he didnt have a chance to live, turns out he didnt, but i only had him on a partial mistake.


<W> There is always a way to invade, and there is always a way to profit from your opponents invasion. This isn't an effective attack on either of your groups, and you should just keep the preasure on him, taking advantage of any mistakes he does, and try to press him towards your thickness.]
;B[dg]C[This accomplishes little. Only play close to your opponents stones when you are defending, when you attack it is vital to stay a bit away from his stones so your moves don't just strenghtens him and gives him something to attack.]
;W[ch];B[ci]C[This doesn't do anything effectively either. since he didn't come around at D12, you should take the opportunity to play there.]
;W[cf]C[Now as well, D12 might kill him here. To let such an accessway to the center stay open is always a bad idea, no matter if he is alive or dead or undesided.]
;B[be]C[Block him in before taking his eyes. If you succeed at taking his eyes, but lets him escape, he has gained alot more than if you succeed at blocking him in, while he lives.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[eh];B[fh]C[This does not work. Too close again. Take your time, secure the stones around his group, instead of pushing to capture in as few moves as possible.]
;W[fg];B[de];W[fi];B[gh];W[ei];B[gk]C[This is a better move, but now you are getting very weak in the center.]
;W[gi];B[gg];W[ii];B[iq]C[Very good move, whites lower edge could easilly solidify during a fight in the middle, and splitting him up in even more groups is sure to help you.]
;W[hq]C[When your opponent plays close to your attacking stones, just strenghten them as reply. J4 is fine here.]
;B[lq];W[nq];B[hr];W[gq]C[Time to secure your access to the center.]
;B[gr]C[Well ok, this is sente and can be played before you move to the center.]
;W[fr];B[mr]C[this group needed to live the most out of all them. but had i done something the group at O-3 would have gotten stronger.


<W> your group is not in much danger, neither is either of the bottom white groups at this point. This move is just gote territory, and splitting him up forther and connecting yourself to the center is worth alot more.]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[jp];B[cr]C[C3 is bigger];W[co];B[bo];W[dn];B[cm]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[cp];W[dq];B[br];W[hh];B[hg];W[ig];B[he]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[if];B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[nr];B[pr];W[or];B[qr]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[kp];B[gn]C[Very bad idea; you've strenghtened white all around this area, and any deep and/or loose stones you place is gonna come under heavy attack.]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[fl];B[fk]C[G8 is a better move here, you should be able to live after white connects, with moves like H10 and M9.]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[fn];W[em];B[il];W[in];B[nl];W[ll];B[mn]
;W[ln];B[mp];W[mq]C[Just cut him here with N5];B[lp];W[mo];B[no]
;W[lo];B[lr];W[nn];B[oo]C[This does not work, white can just play P6]

(;W[po];B[on];W[om];B[nm]C[Now white is in trouble, with just one eye. He has to kill your bottom group before you fill all his liberties.]
;W[op];B[nn];W[ol];B[nk];W[ok];B[nj];W[oj];B[ni];W[gs];B[is]
;W[ms]C[Mistake by white, he should play K2 then K1 first, and kill. Now you can live if you reply at K2]

;B[jn];W[jm];B[ko];W[kn];B[hj];W[ik]C[Mistake, white must protect the cut, either playing J10 or H11]

;W[qb];B[rb];W[oa]
(;B[pb]C[Mistake, white can't do anything here, see variation.]
;W[na]C[Q19 is something on the order of 6 points here, reverse sente, and possibly creating sente endgame moves and/or ko threats against the H17 group.]

(;B[im]C[Nothing.];W[jo];B[sj];W[si];B[sk];W[sg];B[se];W[sf]

<W> first of all, you should not play so agressively. Taking your time with attacks, building up strenghts and elliminating weaknesses will win much more games. Never play close when attacking, or slack when defending. And read out a few moves, to see if you get in trouble or not. If you see that after three moves you cannot save the invasion you played, you could have read three moves ahead to begin with, and make a shallower invasion or taken some other big point. There is a special skill to seing when stones are likely to be lost, and sacrifice them instead of trying to save them. Trying to save stones that are being chased, even when successful, usually loses points, due to the opponent getting strenghts all around the chase.

Access to the center is alot more important than you probably think. All groups should have a way to get to the center, even if it costs them their second eye, and certainly if all you're giving up is third line points along the edge. If you influence the center from all directions, you can make alot of invasions and split your opponent in pieces, since any chase he gives you will end up in the center where your stones are.]
