C[hello reviewer
I have been experimenting with tengen opening, this is first time i try my normal opening for a month or two months now.

lost by 2 points, i play black
probably wrong direction of play or something which i am trying to improve to get stronger.

thanks for any comments];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq]
;B[ci];W[od];B[mc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[qe]LB[nc:a]C[Till now, it is a perfect game. This White 14 is not the usual move at "a"]
;B[rd];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qb];W[md]C[White 20 is clearly the bad direction.]
;B[ne]C[ok , so white makes mistake in joseki and i feel game should be won now
JH : Dificult game for white indeed];W[pe];B[mb];W[de];B[fd]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb]C[is b18 here better ?
JH : When you have already a stone near 7, it is usual to play b18 as you suggest but your move is quite good also.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[ed];B[gd];W[cl]LB[cf:a]C[not sure how to handle this move,
in mini chinese this happens  occasionally and never sure what is right reply
JH : 34 seems very dangerous with a weak group like the one in the upper left corner. An attack at "a" is now good for Black]
;B[ef]C[Not bad];W[ee];B[cg]C[Black 37 : Good move];W[ff];B[dm]
C[this move feels ok but mybe better?];W[dk];B[fh];W[gf];B[ie]
C[h14 instead?
JH : possible but 43 is not bad];W[gh];B[fi];W[fk];B[gi];W[if]
;B[je];W[hh];B[bk]C[51 : wrong. You should go on and get out in the center]
;W[bl];B[cq]C[here i am not sure if this is correct or chase white with f7]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er];W[fr];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq]
;W[go]C[The result up to 64 is better for White but Black is sente and is still in the lead.]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[hk];W[fl]C[White 68 : seems solid but not bad.]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[jk];W[ji];B[ph]C[is this correct point to attack white group?
JH : locally OK.];W[og];B[ni];W[nf];B[me];W[ld];B[mf]LB[ob:a]
C[79 : may be better to take the 2 stones at "a"];W[mg];B[le]
;W[pb]C[ok so i make mistake in reading here and probably now a close game
Yes : 81 also was bad.];B[rc];W[ob];B[kd];W[qc];B[pg];W[pf]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[kq]C[mybe o3 better plan?
JH : If you feel you had to invade here, it is better not to exchange 89 and 91 because White is stronger now]

;W[pc];B[ra]LB[qa:a][rg:b][rb:c]C[B119 : Wrong. You can live at "a" but it is better to connect at "b" or the best is may be at "c" : you are alive and White is not yet alive.]

;W[mi];B[mh]LB[lf:a]C[131 : looks damezumari as "a" is almost sente]
;W[lh];B[li];W[lf];B[lc];W[mj]C[Nice combination for white]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[nk];W[nj];B[ok];W[oj]C[Now Black is in a very difficult position.]
;B[jf];W[ig];B[jj];W[he];B[hd];W[hf];B[qj];W[pk]LB[mk:a]C[White 150 : looks slow. Beter at "a"]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[nq]C[White 154 : also very solid];B[mn]
LB[lo:a]C[Black 155 : If white just play around "a", Black 155 will be dangerous]
;W[rr]C[This 156 doesn't look to work. What about the hane connexion.]

;B[sp];W[so];B[rp];W[sm];B[sr];W[rj];B[om]LB[ri:a][sb:b]C[B169 : This move is too dangerous : you should first answer at "a" or you are dead at "b"]

;B[dj];W[ei];B[ej];W[be];B[ck];W[dl];B[bf];W[bh];B[bi];W[ri]
LB[sb:a]C[210 : should be played at "a"];B[sb]LB[ag:a]C[Bigger to play "a" as Black is almost dead !]
