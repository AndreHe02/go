AB[pd][dp]C[T : Hi, I am Tilwen and I will review your game. First of all, when asking for a review, take a look back at your game and ask "precise" questions : wonder about when you think something ended bad for you, things like that. In this file there is only one question about a very late minor ko, so that I don't know if you think game was OK for you before that or on what part of the game you would like to have advices. Anyway.

When I first look at your game, especially the beginning, I was like "OK, he doesn't play really bad moves but it really seems like White takes the advantage everywhere", and it was a bit confusing. Then I realized that you lost the game mainly because you played too passively, so that you avoid problems for you, but in counter part White can do what he wants too. Remember the value of sente, especially in the opening.

Let's see more precisely.];W[pp];B[dd];W[cj]C[T : I find this kind of move often hard to answer, White isn't really aiming for something except for settling. There are sequences to "attack" the stone (see variation), but as there is a miai between C7 and C13 directions, I am not sure if Black wants to play this right now. Then approaching Q4 is standard I think.]

(;B[jq]C[T : This is a bit passive, even if probably playable.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cp]C[T : I don't really like this move, it seems small. You cannot expect to kill C6 and you will need to play F4 at one point anyway, so why not now ?]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[en];B[gq];W[ef]C[T : And now White got a nice area of influence all over the side. I think that the move that makes you lose the tempo here is the slow C4.

Anyway, White got a nice position but you have sente, which is very important in the opening ! Ask yourself about the whole goban here. Your D16 group is decently solid so that you can use sente to reinforce Q15 or, more usual, to approach Q4.]

(;B[ic]C[T : You lose sente to defend an already solid group :-( . White can sente and plays his game now.]
;W[qj];B[nq];W[pq];B[no];W[qm];B[qf];W[oc]C[T : This really seems like an overplay ^^, but not so easy to deal with.]
;B[pc];W[mc];B[kc];W[ne]C[T : Up to here, White only manage to make your R17 and K18 areas get bigger.]
;B[ph];W[qg]C[T : Complicated move. But maybe playing Q12 at R12 was good enough ?]

(;B[pg];W[qh]
(;B[pf];W[kd];B[jd];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[om];W[on];B[nn];W[pm]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[qi]C[T : Generally you push only if you cut afterwards, or it is a bad exchange (it removes aji, for instance the peep at S11).]
;W[ri];B[oj]C[T : You could play the same variation if R11 and S11 were not here.]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[rf];B[re];W[rg]
(;B[nk];W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[gn]C[T : And once again, you end gote and White takes a big point. G6 expands White's moyo but also reduces greatly the effect of your wall no ? No more moyo. You need to find a way to attack now.]
;B[ih]C[T : This seems very soft, you will help White solidifying its points.]
;W[gh];B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[hk]C[T : Now it is time to find a way to kill O15, at least to take profit somehow, are all your influence goes to nothing.]

;W[bo];B[ap];W[nh]C[T : Is this very threatining ? I think that the upper right corner can live without problem, and the "O10-O3" line shouldn't have any problem right ? White choose not to defend around D13, you really should find a way to get in.]

;B[kg];W[kn]
(;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp]C[This might be better at M4?  The cutting point causes me problems in a few moves.

T : I agree, M4 seems to be a better shape. But the point is, you let White play a move here and only then decided to defend the area, but it was too late (after White L6, Black M5 seems small).]
