AB[pd][dp]C[Hi I'm David B.  Three general comments about your game: 

1.  Try to think about good shape.  Strong shape is dynamic and two-dimensional.  Many of the shapes made by black in this game are not so strong, because of shape.

2.  Thickness.  Avoid playing close to thickness.  Often in this game, black played close to his own thickness, which does not make good use of thickness.

3.  Endgame.  Do not follow white's sente moves with gote defending moves.  Look for sente moves of your own.  

More comments and variations in the game.
Cheers!
-DavidB];W[pp];B[dc];W[ce]LB[de:A][dh:B]C[Why not pinch here? A pincer would have two purposes - force white to run into the centre while developing the D4 stone.]
(;B[de]LB[ce:A]C[There is a joseki for this move, however, it is special.  Black needs to have strength along the top side to justify it.

When you contact a stone, like A, you will help this stone.  White will defend right away, making the A stone stronger.

So, black had better have a good plan for getting good compensation in exchange for helping white make a stable group.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[cd]LB[ef:A]TR[cc]C[Block white from entering the corner.  This would give white too much stability and leave black with almost nothing.]
(;B[ef];W[dg];B[cc];W[eg]LB[fc:C][dd:A][fg:B]C[I don't like this position for black - the cut is not protected and white has gotten influence up to the 5th line for "free."

A is black's move in the game.  
B, I think, is a vital hane for both sides.  (if white gets this hane, black's influence is significantly reduced.
C is the safe move for black - getting good shape and a solid base.  But I'm not sure if black should ignore B though.]
(;B[dd]TR[cb][db][eb]SQ[de][ee]C[I could not remember the Joseki.

When in doubt, think about good shape.
Now white has a stable group, with considerable influence, and black has 6 stones, which have only a small base (triangles).  Granted, black has some influence as well, but the shape of his stones is inferior to whites.  The empty triangle (bad shape) is a good indication that D16 is not a good move.]
;W[nc]LB[kc:B][lc:A][ld:D][qf:C]C[This is not easy to choose - black's group on the left is not exactly ideal, but it is still quite thick and it is certainly not yet in any danger.  

A is possible I think, so long as black remembers that thickness is best used to attack, rather than too make territory. (see an example variation that follows). 

B looks too slack on the white stone and is a misuse of thickness in my opinion. 

C is definitely too slack.]
