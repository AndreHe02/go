;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[ip]TR[jp]C[locally better on the starpoint (hoshi).
The way black played here, it has no relation to the corner  stone because it leaves a too large gap between them.]
;W[cj];B[qk]TR[qk][pd][pq]C[good move, which creates a formation called "chinese  opening" (the marked stones)]

(;W[nc]TR[po]C[I think its probably better to approach at the other corner as  long as possible. If black gets to play at the marked point, he  gets a perfect moyo (large framework). As the proverb says  : "Don앖 let your opponent complete his moyo!".]

(;B[lc]TR[ne];W[ne]C[a counterpincer is probably better, as it causes  complications in black's moyo.]
;B[pf];W[pb]C[to slow. black ignores it and plays on the vital point for  building up his moyo]

(;B[qc]C[Thats also to slow and misses the vital point.];W[qb]
C[Both players are neglecting the most urgent point on the  board (marked). It압 that vital because it builds up the own  moyo while reducing the opponents moyo.]
;B[ic];W[gc]SQ[ng]TR[qh]C[This point implies pressure on the black group and is thus  okay, but I앇 still prefer at one of the marked points to reduce  black압 moyo.]
;B[le];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[ng]C[finally!];B[ph];W[qo]
C[The high approach move is better in this case, as it has  better access to the center and is thus light.
Black is now able to make the white group heavy.];B[qp]C[correct.]
;W[po];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mp]C[White has been forced to give black actual profit on the side.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[ol];B[ok]TR[ej][cd][cc]C[This is unnecessary as it defends no territory nor does it  imply much pressure on the white group. It should have been  used to play one of the marked suggestions, which are much  bigger.]
;W[ln];B[jo]TR[kp]C[Locally better at the marked point as it leaves less aji (bad  possibilities).]
;W[ce]C[good. This makes a nice corner territory, as blck will have it  difficult to invade there anywhere.]
;B[nb]
(;W[od]C[good move.];B[mb];W[lf]C[Also quite reasonable, I think. Black압 group is already  strong, so attaching it and make it even stronger doesn앖  matter.]
;B[ke];W[lh];B[mk]
(;W[sc]C[This is clearly bad. As white has reinforced his group  already, he should not worry about it for the moment and  defend the other one, which has just been attacked by the  last black move.]
;B[rm]C[This is very good, as it deprives white of his base and forces  him to run out into the center. By attacking it, Black will be  able to invade the left side quite easily.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[jn];B[ko]C[The first thing black earned from his attack.
He was able to cover his aji on the lower side in sente.];W[kn]

(;B[jg]TR[sc]C[oh no! Don앖 stop attacking the white group below.
The other white group is already strong as white  has reinforced at the marked point.]
;W[er]C[White also neglects his group.]
(;B[kk]C[This is the wrong direction. Black pushes the white group to  he direction where he wants to develop himself.]
;W[hn];B[ki];W[me];B[sd];W[rb];B[cl]C[It압 much harder for Black to invade here without the support  of his stones he had in those two variations]
;W[dj]TR[dk]C[Playing at the marked point is much tougher.
I앐 going to stop here, as the deep middlegame is more a  matter of reading than of general strategic concepts.
I hope my comments where quite clear, so that you can profit  from them. If you have some special questions for the  middlegame or the yose (endgame) I will be happy to answer  them.
