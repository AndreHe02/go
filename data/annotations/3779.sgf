I hope this review will help you improve your Go];W[dd];B[pp]

;W[rn]C[R: this move is too low, R6 is usual]
(;B[qo];W[ro];B[pm]C[R: the exchange of R5 for S5 is aji-keshi
 It just fixes a defect in White's shape while not giving black anything good]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[fp];W[gn]C[R: White is giving a big territory to Black, this is not absolutely bad since he can regain something attacking C8, but since this simplyfies the game it is a questionable plan in a handicap game]
;B[hp];W[cj];B[ch];W[ej];B[ce];W[cd]
(;B[di];W[dj]TR[di]C[R: this excange is ajikeshi again, and is very bad:
black has lost the connection at C8];B[bd];W[bc];B[bi];W[bj]

(;W[ei]C[Q: It seems somewhat slow, D12 maybe works ?

R: D12 would have been better];B[de];W[ee]C[Q: I think w is too weak to hane here. :-(

R: right, Black should cut at E16 now]
(;B[ef];W[fe]C[R: this way White's unreasonable move at E15 is now a good move]
;B[ff];W[dh];B[dg];W[he]C[R: this leave some bad aji, G15 is the normal move]

(;B[gh]C[Q: Better to live inside, or g12 is ok?

R: see variation, Black should have exploited White's bad aji in the corner first]
;W[cg];B[bg]C[R: This show poor fighting spirit and goes against G12
If black don't want to sacrifice those stones it was better to defend them at once instead of G12]

(;B[kd]C[R: strange move correct shape is kosumi at M16
as the proverb says: "kosumi against keima"]
(;W[qf]C[R: Since S6 is so low the right side is not important
A move at J6 seems bigger since it is at the border of two moyo]
;B[qd];W[qj];B[in]C[R: Good move, it was the key point, now Black seems ahead]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[hl];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]

R: this is surely too deep, see variation for a usual way to reduce Black's moyo]
