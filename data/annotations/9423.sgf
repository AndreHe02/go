[qf][qn][nq]TR[jc][cf][ff][gn]SQ[kc][qc][hq][kq][qq]C[taw: There is no real territory on the board yet. White lower left corner is somewhat under white control (but then E6 would be much stronger at it if it was at C6 or D6 - 5th line is for fighting towards the center, not for securing territory on the borders.)

The rest of the board is just filled with possibilities for expanding. Squares are places white can go. Triangles are places black can go. Circles are where either can go. (just some examples of each)

Don't be scared of black stones. They have influence over larger part of the board, but they're stretched very thin so white should not let black get convert this influence into territory.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]C[taw: So far so good. Black gets right, white gets top, F17-G17 group must run for its life.]
;W[pc]TR[cg][dg][pm][gn][pn][qn][ip][mp][np][hq][kq][nq][qq]
SQ[qb][kc][ne]C[taw: That's the first big mistake of the game. It doesn't protect your stones, and it doesn't threaten R16 cut.

L17 grabs right half of top side while putting weak black F17 group at risk of death.
R18 threatens brutal followfup with S17 - so black will most likely respond with S17 on their own, giving you free territory in the corder while strengthening your group there.
O15 is a more indirect threat of shutting down F17 group, or grabbing the whole center while that group fights for its life.

White could also move elsewhere. (all the triangles for just some ideas). Q17 is simply a wasted stone at time when a single stone is worth a lot.]
;B[od];W[oc]TR[pb][pc]SQ[ic][kc]C[taw: This is second wasted stone in a row. "Empty triangle" shape (like one marked by triangles) is usually bad.

Imagine if instead of Q17 and P17 white stones were at L17 and J17 (squares). Black cannot cut Q18-O17 connection that close to the side anyway.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[mc]C[taw: That's a bit timid too, but understandable.]
;B[le];W[fj]TR[cg][dg]SQ[qb][kc][pm][pn][qn][ip][mp][np][hq]
[kq][nq][qq]C[taw: This move would make sense in different context, but here it seems to accept that black can get al the territory on the sides and wants to move the fight to the center. White can't let black get away with that!

Some offensive ideas marked by squares. White could also strengten D16 group (trangles) in preparation for a fight against G17, but black isn't very aggressive this game eitter.]
;B[jp];W[gn];B[jc]C[taw: White should have moved here first, there were many opportunities for it.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ge];W[gg];B[gf];W[ff];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh]
;W[in];B[kn];W[jl];B[jj];W[hp]TR[kk][ll]SQ[qn][nq][qq]C[taw: The series of moves that just happened makes sense in context of local fighting, but black still doesn't really have territory in the right! White invasion at or near one of the squares would probably live.

As for fighting in the center, one of triangles would probably be stronger at destroying black's hopes of getting any serious territory in the center.]
;B[hq];W[io]TR[qb][ip][er]SQ[kk][ll][qn][nq][qq]C[taw: This move is basically wasted:
* it's not needed to protect or connect your stones
* it doesn't threaten to kill or cut any opponent stones
* it doesn't expand your territory or influence

Sure, it's worth a few points for late game, but something like R3 would be much larger pile of points - either by expanding (squares), or threatening punishment if not answered (triangles).]
;B[ip];W[hi]C[taw: Don't accept the border yet.];B[gp];W[ho]
C[J5 didn't even protect you from having to respond here.];B[ii]
;W[ll];B[hj];W[gi]C[taw: Black taking this stone isn't actually a huge deal. Driving into black territory or invading would work better.]
;B[kl];W[kk]SQ[km][qn][nq][qq]C[taw: It would probably work much better on the other side. Or just screw that and invade now - it's close to the last chance. If M8 ends up connected to living group on the right side of the cut black will look silly.]
;B[km];W[jk]SQ[mk]C[taw: Going right, then either connecting if black ignores or going for live group on the side if black cuts K9 would work better]
;B[lk];W[jm]C[taw: This move does nothing. White can still happily expand in the center, or invade.]

;B[jo];W[fk];B[qq]SQ[pm][qm]C[rfmvad [20k\]: good move

taw: Both players treated Q4 as controlling quarter of the board for very long and got into minor fights over a few points left or right. Finally black realized it's not actually very secure.
Before R3, white invasion was somewhere there was pretty much guaranteed to survive. Even after R3, speculative invasion around R7/Q7 would be totally worth it - black must respond, and white can start a pretty good fight.]

taw: So as a summary:
First, don't let your opponent get away with turning areas where they have one or two stones into solid territory without a fight.
Second, avoid moves that do none of these until it's very late game:
* protect or connect your stones
* threaten or cut opponent's stones
* expand your territory or influence])
