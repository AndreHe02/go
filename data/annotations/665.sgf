C[hi i'm enrico here in incognito :) do u like to help me about
my game

i'm GetOut   there are question on some particular position that give me some
problem, but evry comment is welcome , thx !];B[pp]C[   GetOut 6k : hi !   feste 7k*: hi, where are you?]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[jd]N[W shld occupy the LL without 2nd thought,  CORNER >
SIDE.];B[dp];W[pe];B[nd]C[   GetOut 6k : italy];W[qc];B[qb]
;W[qd];B[ob];W[qj]LB[ph:a]C[here w played overplay with 12  r11 is joseki?

but question is black played bad joseki o16 is without extension, then i
think black can do better, what ?]N[Bad move.  W shld play r12 or r11 (which
is more solid). W still need one more hands at 'a'...Figure out this way...if
W plays 'a' 1st will W still plays r10 (which is inefficient)?]
;B[dj];W[jq]C[k3 is a big move but r10 is  a little weak i think, r6 was
better ? or some other move to protect r10 and q6 ?];B[hq]C[i dont like h15 because c3 is open, there is some other idea ?]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[qn];B[np];W[qq];B[pq]N[B p3 better.];W[qp];B[po]
;W[qo];B[cf]N[My suggestion is B n3 (to prevent W n3), looks conservative
but it's "thick" and make W k3 a "bad move".];W[fd];B[ef]N[Still B n3.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[eq]N[Good move? Rather like
a fake move. Still, B c6 better.];W[er];B[fr];W[ds];B[cn];W[pn]
N[Good move. Very urgent here.];B[on]C[i need help now, i want to save k14 , but i dont know what to do
, can u tell me some proverb or some idea if i want to try to save a
stone in moyo ?

in this case i play evrytime panic move without idea :) thanks!]
N[W p7 > 100 pts. B got a moyo, W dun have one on the right?]
;W[lp];B[mq];W[hp]N[Better not to save this stone...Still p7 more crucial.]
;B[gq];W[mp]C[this move seems slow to me b can cut ?];B[no]
;W[kq];B[nr];W[hm]C[this is a littel overplay i think what shall i do :)?]
N[I dun understand this move. Shape is at k5. Or if W want to reduce the
left moyo...g9.];B[ip]N[Good move.];W[jn];B[lo]LB[ln:a]N[Maybe 'a' better.]
;W[ko];B[mo];W[jp]N[Good move, lotsa eye shape.];B[io];W[in]
;B[ho]N[W very successful here, wat B get is one stone :).]
;W[fm];B[dm]N[d7 too submissive...h17 shld be the more aggresive approach.]
;W[om]N[W seems to get all the good point.];B[nm];W[ol]LB[nl:a]
N[W shld double hane at 'a'.];B[km]N[Not really a good attack...W's grp
too strong...B shld play h17 to start a new fight.];W[kn];B[lm]
;W[gf]C[is a littel move maybe was better running to center like g10?]
N[Another good point...protect h17 and looks after the center grp.]
;B[fk];W[ik];B[bd]N[c17 to get the corner better.];W[cc];B[gg]
;W[nf]N[A little out...h13 better.];B[ii]C[what i must to considere here before deciding direction of move
(in other word what think a player more strong than me before the move
:) ?]N[B h13 thicker...aims at h17 and the center weak piece.]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[gk];B[fl]N[B g11 better.];W[gl];B[id]N[Wrong invasion....U
shld know where to play now :).];W[ic];B[jk]N[W alive here...B juz too
many weaknesses to exploit.];W[ij];B[jj];W[ih];B[ji];W[gh];B[hg]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[ei];W[jl];B[fj]C[l2 make the seccond eye here ?]
;W[kl];B[mk];W[fg]C[maybe this move work i was very lucky here :)]
;B[eh];W[ig];B[hf];W[if];B[he];W[ff]N[Looks like a strong move working
:)];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd];W[ee];B[eg];W[fe];B[gc]N[Difficult to survive for
this kind of situation.];W[ie];B[hd];W[fc];B[gb];W[jc]N[Game over at this
point.];B[je];W[jf];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf]N[Guess this is kinda taking chance
to resign type of move :)];W[le];B[kd];W[ld])
