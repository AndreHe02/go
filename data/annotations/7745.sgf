C[REVIEWER: Pete, 4k AGA (pete0877 gmail)

General advice for black: look for moves that keep sente while making points and don't make your opponent too strong too early. On mutiple occasions during the game black chose a 1-point gote move because he was focusing on local area too much. Step back with every move and look at the whole board! Make it a habit.

General advice for white: in this game white was very agressive towards big black groups that are relatively safe (e.g. moves L15, M13). White should have probably focused his attack on the weak black group in the lower right corner. I think it is possible to kill it - just need to go through some variations. Either way it would make white much stronger in thar area. Overall, game well played with just a few overplays, it seems.]

[pp][mq][qq]C[MOVE 54 . Black to move. White looks to have a small advantage going into the middle game. Leading by less than 10 points, and black has sente.

Should Black move at A,B,C, or D

(Real Game: Black at E)

PETE: A and C are gote moves so they are not ideal at this stage of the game. 
E is definitely better locally because it 1) enlarges the black's area and 2) threatens to go deeper into white's territory so white should respond to it. 
However, the group of black marked stones is not very secure. There are some serious trouble if white was to play at F or D.]

;W[lg];B[mf];W[lh];B[jm]LB[nn:B][dr:A]C[PETE: Invasion at A might be better - white is fairly safe and can get safer while threatening black by playing at B.]
;W[jj]LB[go:C][oq:B][rq:A]C[PETE: this move will only make black stronger. White should consider playing at A or B to attack black or get stronger at C.
White is currently ahead so White should play safe and secure his position and threaten black while doing so.]
