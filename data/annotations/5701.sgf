Reviewed for black 8feb2007 by Allan Wickberg, 9k@DGS. Comments marked "al>".

al> It may seem that this review is unfairly rough on black, as white makes his fair share of mistakes as well. However, as the review was requested by black, I have concentrated on commenting black's moves.

al> Also, please don't take my comments for the undisputed thruth - I am doing what I am able to :)]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[on]SQ[qk]TR[iq][kq]C[al> P6 does not put pressure on white, rather it encourages white to extend - and win points - along the right side. Nor does it create potential territory for black, since the bottom is easy to invade for white.

al> I would suggest black to play at L3 or J3 to build potential territory at the bottom, or around R9 to squeeze white. The object shold not be to actually kill the white group, but to chase it in order to build along the right side towards the Q16 stone on the top.]
;W[pm]C[al> white reponds as if black had played R9 instead of playing there himself. Black could ignore this and play anywhere on the board, actually, since it is not a threat.]
;B[pl]C[al> Q8 is not a good way to threaten the white group, or creating territory along the right side. White can undercut with R8, practically asserting life for the white group. Black R8 would have been better as a threat and R9 still better for building along the side.]
;W[om];B[nm]C[al> Contact play should be saved for survival and for reinforcing borders. It is less efficient for attacking, mostly, though sometimes it is necessary for poking out eyes.

al> Look at the black Q8 stone now. It is vulnerable to attack by white, and not in a good spot to use for building territory. Had it been on R9, a play at Q10 or R11 would have been nice for black.

al> O7 at O6 would start to indicate a moyo for black at the bottom right. Now black leaves a cut at O6 that could prove troublesome later.]
;W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ol]C[al> White uses the ill-placed black stone at Q8 to move upwards along the right side. Black should have considered sacrificing the stone in benefit of putting an end to white's march upwards by playing R10 instead. By trrying to save Q8 black puts two stones in harm's way, making it possile for white not only to gain territory along the side, but also poke into the center, as we shall see a couple of moves from now.]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[qj];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph]MA[nl][nm][ol][pi][pj][pl]
C[al> One possible outcome of fights like this is that one player gets the inside, and the other gains influence towards the center in exchange. In this case, black lost the side as well as allowing white to reach into the center, which makes it hard for black to get points there. So black has spent seven stones that creates relatively little value. Consider those seven stones placed to enforce the black corner stones, for instance, and compare the amount of points that could have generated in exchange for white's right side territory.

al> The reason for black's poor exchange is applying contact play in the wrong context. Play from some distance instead, just to make the opponent worry, and build territory in the process.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[kp]C[al> "Corner, side, center"; Since it is easier to make points in the corner, prio should be given to prevent white from getting a big corner, or getting it yourself before playing on the side. Simply by playing C4, B4 (if white follows with C3, B3) deprives white of three-four points in the corner while building a wall that should yield at least ten points on the left side.  As black would have to finish off by playing around C8, of course white could then make a dent at the bottom, but it would not be worth as much as fifteen points.

al> Black L4 may look like it is worth about 15 points, but in reality, black would get a fair share of them even if white invades, so it is better to focus on creating fresh points instead.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bp];B[bo]C[al> Now, in return for some 6-7 points gained by black L4, white got another 3-4 corner points, and black has a very weak position beside the white corner. White can reach out towards the center from F3, as well as cut at D5, which means that black has a hard time making points in the vincinity above the white stones.

al> Black has to mend the cutting point, at least, which gives white the opportunity to play first on the left side.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[ef];B[fd];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[fg]C[al> To threaten the white stones, it would be better to try to cut under them instead. Black should use the C12 stone to make a moyo along the left side instead, for instance by playing C9. That would make the exchange very good for black, with beginning territory on the top as well as on the side, while white only gains a few points with the C15 group.]
;W[ff];B[gf]C[al> Again, contact play will only benefit white here, as it did in the lower right. If white plays B17, he is pretty much settled, so G14 only amounts to putting black stones in jeopardy.

al> Because it is valuable for white to play B17, it is likely as valueable for black to play there. "The opponent's critical point is your own" (or something)]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[qh]C[al> "Urgent before big"; mend vulnerabilities first, make big points next - the lower left needs attention from black.

al> This is the plan:
1- Am I vulnerable somewhere? If yes, fix it.
2 - Is he vulnerable anywhere? If yes, attack
3 - Are there big points to be made? If yes, do.

al> Very possible, 2) and 3) could be swapped, but the result of losing a significant group is what usually makes the most diffrence on the outcome of a game, so 1) stays on top.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[sh];B[of]C[al> Black T13 is sente, as black could capture the S12 group with S11, should white fail to answer. So black gets to play P14 anyway. Or any other move, for that matter - the points gained by P14 is easily outweighed by a white invasion in the top right corner, which is still open. P14 would be better spent at O17.]
;W[kc]C[al> As the top was wide open, white can play right in the middle and is able to extend to either H17, or O17 depending on which side black will block.]
;B[ic];W[nc];B[oc]C[al> As noted earlier in this game, contact play will strenghten both players, so black better be doing this to reinforce the corner, rather than as an attempt to kill white.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[ke];B[ie];W[ne];B[oe]C[al> Black P15 saves one point. Considering the damage white can inflict at the lower left, this is the wrong priority.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[mg];B[mh]C[al> The double hane at N12 is good, locally, because it gives black a reach out in the center. Black has some influence around the middle of the board, provided he gets to play O9 r O10 before white stretches that tentacle too far,]
;W[lg]C[al> I don't feel P12 is necessary. Even if white should capture O13 there is not so much value in doing so. Black would gain more by O9/O10 and going for a moyo around M8 by playing the mid point, maybe.

al> Again, this evaluation is local, as the most points are to be gained along the left side, if black gets there first.]
;B[oh];W[ck];B[cl]C[al> If black would have had a good wall at line 4, this would definitely be coming from the wrong direction. D10 instead, would puch white against that wall for a good fight.

al> Now, I am not sure. However, I still think it is wrong to get in contact like this. It will benefit white as it provides leverage to wrestle out of there. I believe that it would be better for black to push from the top, with D8 or D7, to try to stenghten the influence in the center as well as balancing the weak group below.]
;W[ci];B[di]C[eli: I'm not sure about that one, what would be better?

al> A solid connection with D12 is better locally. But black should consider where he has potential. Black has a lot of influence around L6 that could be turned into points eventually, if only black prevents white from entering there. F4 is important in that respect. However, black already has a lot of potential territory around the edges, so tightening up the borders there would be enough.

al> The corners and sides are gnerally more important than the center, since it is most often too easy for the opponent to reach in and destroy territory in the middle of the board. But here, black has good opportunities to take points in the center as well, so it is a good thing to look at that, too.]
;W[cj];B[dg];W[df];B[eg]C[al> B12 is a good point for white to play in order to save the C10 group. Consequently, he should have sacrificed the E14 group and played there instead of D14. 

al> Also, black should play B12 instead of E13.  Try out the scenario where white plays E13 and evaluate what effect it has on black.

al> Black B12 actually threatens both white groups, which is a nice example of applying the proverb
"If the opponent has two weak groups, attack both at once".

al> Following up with a monkey jump from B12 to A15 could capture the corner, which would be huge.]
;W[bh];B[cg]C[al> Black C13 amounts to very little and should probably be saved to use as a ko threat. It is much more important to mend the position below line 8.

al> The E13 group is also weak because of the cutting point at G13.  It forms an open triangle, which is ineconomic in terms of liberties. A couple of moves from now this will be more obvious.]
;W[bg];B[dk]C[al> Providing the opponent with cutting points like D8 is not such a good idea. D8 wold have been better as it would reinforce black's influence in the lower center. Possibly F4 would do that even better.]

[sb][sc][sd]C[al> O19 is really an endgame move that yields a couple of points. It is especially badly timed at this point, when white can reach out from D10 and destroy practically every point in the center for black.

al> Also, take a look at the E13 group, the "open triangle". A white cut at G13 would be severe. Not so much for the risk of white capturing the group, but rather to use the threat as leverage to create other kinds of havoc.

al> The current tentative score is now: white 42 something, black 63 something. As we can see, the center is not critical for black, can he just keep his groups alive.  White, on the other hand, really has to kill something in order to win, as well as preventing black from turning his influence towards the center into extra points.]
;W[ma];B[oa];W[lb];B[jb];W[kb];B[jg]C[al> K13 pushes white towards the center. It would be better to come from the other direction to keep white away from the center. Maybe something like N10 to prevent a push from P9 as well as from above.]
;W[kh];B[ki]C[eli: I was thinking very long about this one. Probably not the best move. How about M10 or H11?

al> Avoid contact play unless you a trying to survive in a tight spot, or want to reinforce a border. In this game, black plays a lot of single stones that white is able to use as leverage.]
;W[jh];B[ih]C[al> Like here, another single stone, and also leading in the wrong direction. Black wants to keep white out of the center not lead him into it.]
;W[ji];B[ii]C[al> Black keeps pushing white out into the center, as we shall see, all the way down into the area around L6, where black could have made a nice moyo.]
;W[jj];B[kk]C[al> A one point jump here invites white to cut at L10, with an atari to go with it.]
;W[kj];B[li]C[al> At least, the follow up should be in connection with L9. The L11 stone can be sacrificed in return for a moyo in the lower center.]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[lk];B[ll];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[gj];W[kl]C[eli: ups! I didn't saw that one, but then decided that wouldn't hurt too much.

al> try to favour solid connections before single stones to avoid these situations.]
;B[km];W[jl];B[im]C[al> The one point jump is not so good here, as it is too easy for white to cut (at K7). Black K7 would have given black a comfortable number of points at the bottom center.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jn];B[in];W[gk];B[fk];W[fl];B[fm]C[eli: very bad move, I should have connected at E9, because...

al> K5 is worth a lot - for both players];W[ek]C[eli: ...outch!

al> It is just one stone.];B[fj]C[al> D8 would be more important for the lives of the black stones around D6.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[gm];B[gn];W[cm]C[eli: outch again! It seems I often play to light?

al> Those single stones invites these kinds of situations.]
;B[gq]C[eli: Bad attack in hindsight, would F4 or G4 be better?

al> F4, definitely. G3 drives white towards the weak group - it should be the other way around.]
;W[fp];B[fo]C[eli: same mistake as before! should connect at E7

al> I think G5 is the best way to save most of the stones.]
;W[em];B[dn];W[bm];B[en];W[fn];B[go];W[fm];B[hm];W[jo]C[al> K5 is BIG.]

White: 47+4+0,5 = 51,5
Black: 71

al> White has destroyrd much of black's potential in the lower center, but not gained so many points of his own. Since black did not have to rely on the center ponts to win, he is still in the lead.]

;W[bl];B[dl];W[ao];B[do];W[jf];B[if];W[kg];B[hg]C[eli: stupid

al> Not that stupid. H13 has the benefit of covering the cut at G13. Otherwise white could have gotten three ko threats out of that position, using G13 and E11 to threaten black's open triangle, the F13 group.]

;W[fe];B[ge]C[eli: this sould connect at E16 and this probably made me loose the game...]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[ee];B[dc]C[al> D17 should be at F17. The D16 stone is not in atari yet.]
;W[ca];B[da];W[ba];B[oj]C[al> Of course, black should tighten things up at F17 instead. black has several single stones in his positions: S13, D19,F16, D11, and those kind of stones always pose problems in the endgame as the provide white with sente moves.]

C[eli: this is certainly not the correct answer.

al> Black T14 gives white a double atari which turns the game. S14 minimizes the damage. My editor is behaving funny, so I won't add a variation, but B S14, W T14, B S16. is plausible.

;B[mn];W[tt];B[mm];W[il];B[tt]C[Played February 4, on KGS manolo 14k vs eli 18k H4

eli: The defeat was probably due to losing the group at D17, and I was somewhat angry to loose that game. A victory seemed possible.

al> The loss of the D17 group was balanced by the capture of the F7 group. The loss of the upper right corner, I would say, was more of a turning point for the outcome of this game. But if black could have turned the influence in the center into territory, instead of letting white trickle down right through it, even the loss of the corner could have been endured.

I just started playing recently (about 2 months ago). I had a look at two books (The second book of go and Lessons in the fundamentals of go) and I play online only for the moment. Further I am only able to play during weekends.

Any advice would be appreciated.

al> Despite of all my comments about mistakes, this is not so badly played for soemone that has only started out two months ago. I have seen a lot worse, so your studying probably pays off. Good luck in the future!]
