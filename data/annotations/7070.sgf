C[K- Thanks for sending your game in for review. All my comments will be prefix 'k' like this one. I've had a quick scan through the game and I see you have not added any comments of your own, so I am not sure if there are any particular questions you want answering points of the game that you want feedback on -- if there are, feel free to get back to me for further comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[de]LB[kq:A]C[K- reasonably straightforward so far. Your shimari balances black's so the game is peaceful so far. An alternative strategy that you might want to explore is to use your third move to take sente (e.g. approaching the top right corner) or to restrict black's development (e.g. at A)]
;B[cc]C[K- very aggressive... but remember, your shimari is balanced between corner and side, you can let black live small in the corner while you get territory along the side(s) and wall him in]
;W[cd];B[bc];W[bd];B[ad];W[ae];B[ac];W[bf];B[db];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[fb];B[fc];W[ea];B[ca];W[gc]LB[gb:A]C[K- probably a mistake - forcing black to strengthen his stone while creating cutting points for yourself... I would suggest calm extension at A instead]
;B[fd];W[gb];B[ee];W[dd];B[ed]C[K- mistake by black surely -- his corner stones need help]
;W[bb]C[K- yes, should be dead now];B[da];W[fa]LB[cb:A]C[K- no, at A  would be best locally (double atari)]
;B[ba];W[ab];B[gd];W[hd];B[he];W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[hc];W[id]
C[K- no, saving this stone is not the priority :)];B[hb]C[K- :(]
;W[cb];B[ga]TR[hd][id]C[K- ok well both sides made mistakes in this battle, but if you can make good use of your marked stones then we can probably say that white came away with the advantage]
;W[fb]C[K- nothing to gain here; if you see any weaknesses, save them for ko threats later]
;B[fa];W[ld]C[K- good...];B[jd];W[ie];B[if];W[hf]TR[ld]C[K- black should let you take this stone and attack your solitary stone (triangle) instead...]
;B[ge];W[hg]LB[jf:A]TR[jd]C[K- I would suggest you continue to attack black's marked stone with something like a play at A instead]
;B[je];W[fg];B[gf];W[gg];B[ic];W[dj]LB[cm:B][dm:A]C[K- right idea but too close to your wall, I would suggest A or B instead here]
;B[lc];W[dm]LB[kq:A]TR[dj]C[K- now that you have this stone, the triangle stone is obviously inefficient, imagine if you had it around A instead.... :)]
;B[cj]C[K- not a sensible invasion... black has no supporting stones anywhere near and must simply hope that you make a mistake defending. You should play calm, solid moves, avoiding creating bad cutting points...]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[cg];W[bj];B[bi];W[bk];B[cf]
;W[bg];B[bh]C[K- why does he persist? he can get nothing here]
;W[dk];B[ig];W[ih]TR[jh][ji][ki][kj][lj][lk]C[K- I guess you are wanting to create some territory in this area? unfortunately, if you both build a diagonal wall here roughly where I have put triangles, black gets more than you do (because of his shimari in the bottom right)... I would suggest you invade on the right side before it is too late]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[ji];W[pj];B[qj]C[K- ooh, very strange defence...]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[rk];B[rj]C[K- yurgh...];W[pk];B[sk]LB[pi:A]C[K- wasted move, you should not respond to this - instead push at A and punish black for the empty triangle]
;W[sl];B[sj];W[rm];B[rn];W[qm];B[sn];W[sm];B[qn];W[pm];B[pn]
;W[ol];B[om];W[ok];B[nm];W[ql]C[K- I don't like this sequence, from your point of view.... you have a small live group (albeit rock solid now) while black has a big corner and influence upwards and all over the lower right - black got more out of this than you]
;B[pi];W[qq]LB[kq:A]C[K- too deep, you cannot win here, you should play around A in order to just reduce black's potential]
;B[qp];W[rq];B[rp]LB[qr:A]C[K- mistake by black, allows you to build eye space (should be at A)]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[qs];B[sq];W[rr];B[sr];W[os]C[K- wow! he was kind to you :)]
;B[ns];W[nq];B[mr];W[np];B[pp];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[kq];W[jr]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[jp];B[kp]LB[lo:A];W[lo];B[ko]
;W[ls];B[op];W[jo];B[ln]LB[kn:A]C[K- mistake by black, should be at A]
;W[kn];B[mn];W[jq];B[ms];W[ks]LB[oi:A][dq:B]C[K- wasted move, I would suggest A instead (make his top right smaller than your bottom left then play at B to secure it all)]
;B[jn];W[km]LB[in:A]C[K- your stone is worthless, sacrifice it; play at A instead]
;B[jm];W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[lk];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[nk];W[kk]
;B[jl];W[lj];B[kj];W[jk];B[ik];W[jj];B[ki];W[ij]C[K- black is in trouble now, with a group fighting for life in the centre and you have an open door to his top right area....]
;B[hk];W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[hm];W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[fl];W[gm]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[fm];W[gn];B[hn];W[go];B[ho];W[hp];B[gp];W[io]
;B[fo];W[in]C[K- well, the whole lower right quarter of the board was very scrappy, difficult to say who came out ahead... it does seem early to resign though... the score estimator shows black on +1.5 although it thinks the white group in the lower right is dead, so actually white will be ahead by about 15. If no one makes any mistakes it is hard to see where black to come back to win, but it would only take 1 mistake by you and the game could swing...

Again, thanks for sending this in for review. I would suggest that next time you include a few comments to indicate what you were planning, and any questions you want answering. If you want any more explanation, just drop me a line and I'll be happy to take a look.]
