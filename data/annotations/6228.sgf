C[N: I was forced to resign this very close game because I had to leave. Please review it anyway, because I believe I have a lot to learn from it.

I think i did some things well, and also made some mistakes.

Hi, I am asurei-7k. I will try my best to review your game.This is my first review so I am sorry if I make any mistakes.]
;B[pc]
(;W[dd]C[White 2 here is not a good move, you should play at a, to be on the same line with black stone( prevent sliding move), or you can also try alternatives at b, c, d, e or f.]
;B[pp]
(;W[dp]C[Well, here I think D3 is better, you will earn the same advantage as black on the upper board.]
;B[cf]
(;W[ci]C[W6 is not a good move with beginners, you should not try those joseki you dont know how to move next!! Better choosing safer options, see variation.]
;B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[bh]C[N: I think the opening moves are very hard. How did I do?

Black 9 is in wrong direction, normally black will jump to a, and then play B17, C16 and pincer White C11 at around D9. See variation]

(;W[cg]C[B10 is definitely wrong move, see variation];B[bg]

(;W[ce]C[C12 is bad, the situation here was actually not good for white since the move at C13.]
;B[be];W[df];B[bf]C[N: I should have been able to kill this group. Where did I go wrong?]

(;W[bc]C[W16 is totally wrong way! See variation];B[bi]
(;W[ai]C[W18 is out of question???? You cant kill black here as C12 is your terrible weakness, you got a lot of cut points here.]

(;B[ah]C[Now, Black made a funny move!! Black fears to not be able to make 2 eyes!! He could escape esily and could destroy white's territories on the lower!]
;W[bj]C[nah, C12 still better];B[aj];W[ak]C[again, C12's better]
;B[bk]C[C10 is obvious move];W[ai];B[cj];W[ck];B[aj]
(;W[dj]C[Whenever you get into such sitiuation, take my advice, go fight elsewhere!! It's bad if black made a move first at K16]

(;B[bj];W[bl]MA[dg][ch][di][dk][cl]C[again and again, never play move like this, you got hundreds of cut points (X)!!!]
;B[al];W[am]C[I dont understand W32???];B[bm];W[cl];B[an];W[dk]
;B[ch]C[now when the fun was enough for black, he stroke at your serious weakness]
;W[di];B[dh];W[ef]
(;B[dg]C[black's 41 is waste, only 1 stone! while black can play somewhere at K16, a lot more points lie there!!]

(;W[de]C[white 42 is so wasteful! You must look at your shape, normally, at the beginning, people play large move, remember to check variation whenever I make comments]
;B[eh]TR[fg][fh]C[Black 43 is tooooooooooo slow!! Again black should move right away at K16. If white to jump out, play at triangle, not B43!]
;W[db]C[N: I decided to give up the side, grab the top left corner and go elsewhere.

No, 44 is too small! And black cant invade you here unless he wants to commit suicide, =). White 44 should be around J16, see previous variation]
;B[co]TR[jc][jd][gp][gq][jp][fp][fq][cq]C[B45's not good, Black should play at one of the triangle]
;W[do]C[W46 here is good];B[cn];W[dm]
(;B[cm]C[If I were Black, I would cut at a, and then cut , white will be in trouble!]
;W[dn];B[bq];W[cq];B[cp]C[here white should turn away to use his big wall]

(;W[dq];B[qe]C[black 55 is not bad but if back play at K4, white's moyo gone!! White suffers big loss!]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[O3 is ok]
(;W[qj]C[N: This stone did a lot for me later in the game. Was it a good play?

No, bad, should be at K4, it did a lot for you due to black's mistakes, not that it was a good move.]

(;B[nc]C[black 59 is too small!];W[kc]C[W60 is good];B[mc]C[Black 61 is unbelievable, I dont get the idea behind it !!]

(;W[id]C[W62 should be at L15 or L16];B[lc]C[again, B63's........... (dont know how to explain) =)]

(;W[jd]C[no, W64 should be at either L18 or L16];B[lq]C[Black 65's good]

(;W[mp]C[no, no and no, you have two options here, defend territory or attack, if you have moved at K4 before like I commented, M3 is much easier to handle!]
;B[lp];W[lo]C[never put stone on the head of stronger opponent! Moreover, ur shape's bad]
;B[hp]C[N: Here I first tried to take the bottom side, but later went for the middle of the board instead.


I cant see your middle territory anywhere!];W[gp]
(;B[hq]C[Black 71's not good]
(;W[gq]C[if u want center, come out for center, see variation]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[ko];W[ln];B[kn];W[jr]C[black cant be killed, he can come out at L7 and you cant stop him, so W78 is nonsense]
;B[lr];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr]C[N: I guess i played too many stones here.

Yes, 'cause W80 is wrong move. Black cant be killed];B[ir];W[km]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[in]MA[lm]C[White has a cut at M7];W[hl];B[fh]
C[Black seems prefer nobi-moves!! nobi is good but in these cases they are too slow and dont give black any profit!]

(;W[gn]C[White should invade at R3, black stones in the right lower corner can be killed, see variation]
;B[im];W[il];B[lm]C[Good, cut the right point!];W[jl];B[fj]
;W[fl]C[again, white 98 is small, R3 is still lot better];B[ek]
;W[el];B[ej];W[gl]C[W102 is questionable];B[ei];W[dl];B[gi]
C[Black 105?????];W[mm]C[N: Why does black not try to save this stone?]
;B[qg];W[ll];B[ql];W[ok]C[White 110 should still be at R3];B[pq]

(;W[ji]C[N: I am now tring to steal the center to compensate for my losses in the cornes and at the sides.

I felt this was a good move. Not to close to B and not to far away.

You didnt have any good moves lefts! Only so-so moves! and 112 is so-so, actually H13 is better]
;B[hi]C[again Black's move makes himself overconcentrated!! He gets not profit]

(;W[ig]C[W114's too far! H13's better];B[gg];W[gf];B[hg];W[hf]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[ii]
(;W[jf];B[ij]
(;W[jj]C[W124 is no need];B[ik];W[jk];B[hk];W[gk];B[gj]
(;W[nf]
(;B[oe]C[N: In the following sequence I am trying to grab as much as possible. Clould I have done better?

actually, coz black 's moves around H9 are so clumpsy, u luckily made a good wall so you can try such move like O14, though I think P12 is better as black can invade u at P12 if you move O14!]

(;W[le]C[no, turn to play at P12 now!];B[ne];W[mf];B[of];W[oh]
;B[og];W[ng]C[bad shape: empty triangle though you have no other move]
;B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[pj];B[rk];W[pl];B[qk]C[no need to play W146]

(;W[pk];B[ri]
(;W[qi]C[no, play P6 is better, or play endgame moves now! see variation]
;B[qh];W[rj];B[sj];W[pn]C[good];B[qo];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[po]
;W[om];B[nn];W[on];B[qm];W[or];B[pr];W[mr];B[ks];W[lb];B[mb]
;W[ka];B[ma];W[rh];B[si];W[sh]C[N: A futile attempt to do something in the top right corner.

When estimating score i thought black had a slight advantage at this time.


If you have more experience, you will see that W170 is useless!]
;B[sk];W[ld];B[md];W[me];B[la];W[kb];B[ff];W[fe];B[fg];W[ge]
C[W182 is unnesscessary];B[ad]
(;W[ac]C[not good, see variation];B[ho];W[go];B[hm];W[gm];B[hs]
C[Black 189 should be at G1];W[gs];B[js]C[N: No need for B to do that, right?

Yeah, Black lose 1 point for nothing]
(;W[ns]C[and now white play nonsense];B[ps];W[os]C[N: Here, I was forced to resign, due to lack of time. (I had to go to work.)

When playing the end by myself, black once won by perhaps 5 points and white once won by 0.5 points.

If I had had the chance, I would have played b2 to contest the corner. I also wanted to play first n1 and then p3 or n3.

Any tips to improve my play would be most appreciated!

/Nisse

Well, for you, I would advise that you should learn some basic joseki, learn what is a good shape, do a lot of life and death problems, and play 9x9 board more (to train attacking), and one more thing, know when to play tenuki. Hope you feel my comments useful, thank you and good luck to you!]
