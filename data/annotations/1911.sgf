RE[B+10.5]

C[I played black as yfh2 on this game.

I eventually won it, because I succeeded in killing a w group, but otherwise, result was in W favour.

What I would like to know is where I did take wrong options in :
- fuseki
- defending from W invasion in bottom left

An other question is how (and when) could I have invaded / reduced W left side.

Don't spend time after B 143];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq]
;W[fc];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]MA[oq]LB[hp:a]C[Black J3 to be played at 'a' better because of the marked stone at P3.

In general, stones at 3rd line have little potential for expansion, thus you need to strike a balance putting stones on the 3rd line and the 4th line.]
;W[ck];B[jd]LB[pj:a]C[Black K16 to play at 'a' or R10 better.

If so, you will have a nice moyo on the right.];W[dh]LB[qj:a]
C[Bad move, White should play at 'a' to divide Black's moyo.]
;B[pj]C[So far, I would say that B does have a better position ...

Yes, probably because of White D12, a fuseki mistake.];W[md]
;B[lc]LB[pf:a]MA[jd][md]C[Correct ?

Wrong Black 'a' to protect moyo on the right better.

The marked black stone and the white stone are equally strong...

Black Q14 is better in term of points, Black M17 doesn't give you many points so to say.]
;W[mc];B[oc]MA[lc][mc]C[M17/N17 is in favour of White.

Try not to make unfavourable exchange, omitting them, you will be playing good Go :)

Just Black P17 or Q14 without exchange M17/N17, this is my point.]
;W[ld]C[Thick move, I am not sure whether it's good, but personally I will play White N14 or N13, to enter the center faster.

White M14 also created good points, both at K14 an Q14.];B[kc]
;W[pg]MA[mc][md][ld]LB[hc:a][jf:b][lg:c]C[Not very good move, White must be thinking the 3 marked stones are strong group, which in fact not the case.

Correct sequence is White 'a', Black 'b' and White 'c'.

Driving black stones out and strengthen the 3 marked stones at the same time.

This is what the pros called "rhythm".];B[of]C[trying to cut

Good move!!!

Punishing white for invading when ownself is weak.];W[qi]LB[og:a]
[nf:b][lf:c][ng:d][oi:e]C[Well, White should try to get the rhytmn right here.

White 'a', Black 'b', White 'c', Black 'd', White 'e'.];B[qj]
MA[qi][qj]C[Again, R11/R10 exchange is in favour of Black.

Try to avoid making such exchange unless there is no other ways out.]
;W[rf]LB[qe:a][rd:b][nh:c]C[The right sequence should be White 'a', Black 'b', White 'c'.

Reduce the corner, enter the center.];B[rd];W[pf];B[pe];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[ri]LB[rh:a]C[I think White 'a' is better...   White is not clean here, still need another move to make sure it is alive.]
;B[kf]C[Good move!!!

Black still need to beware of aji at White R8.];W[mf];B[og]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[lh];B[ge]LB[kh:a][li:b][jj:c]C[Black should play 'a', White 'b' then Black 'c'.]
;W[fe]LB[kh:a]C[White shown too much concern in protecting the left moyo.

However, if White play 'a' to control the center, once it's strong...

Invasion at R8 will be possible.];B[ff];W[ee];B[fg]LB[ji:a]
C[Black 'a' better.];W[gd];B[he]LB[ji:a]C[Well, last chance for Black to play 'a'.

Black is too concern about shape, 'a' is more urgent however...

Black will still get to play H15 at later stage :)];W[kh];B[jh]
;W[mj]LB[ji:a][ii:b][jj:c][ih:d][lj:e]C[This is not the correct shape.

The right sequnce is White 'a'. Black 'b', White 'c', Black 'd', White 'e'.]
;B[ml]LB[ji:a]C[Black 'a' to remove the eye-shape of White and strengthen the group very much better in this case.

Don't even assume the you can get the whole of the center...

Shift your focus on getting the sides instead, center is only a battlefield, most of the time no one tends to get many points in the center.]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[ii]LB[kj:a]C[White should play 'a' for eye-shape.

Clearly if Black is alive, there is no point trying to seal it.]
;B[dg]LB[kj:a][ki:b][dk:c]C[
If I were to play, it's Black 'b', White 'b' then Black 'c', still aiming at the White weak group...

Black 'c' is a very cruel form of attacking...   There is nothing much to lose strengthening  the lower left but much to gain from attacking the center weak group.


Black D14 is end-game move, personalIy I think even M4 is bigger than D14 in term of points.

So sorry to critize on this.];W[cg];B[df];W[cf];B[de];W[dd]

C[Black giving white eye-shape, which is no good for later attack or killing...]
;W[ol];B[nk];W[ok];B[oj];W[nj];B[ph]LB[oh:a]C[I had seen the possibility of killing this W group, and wanted to prevent W from making it alive, while connecting R10, in case W P8/Q6 lived

Risky, still a cut at 'a'.

Black should play 'a', aiming at S13 for a kill...];W[qh];B[pi]
LB[oh:a]C[Black 'a' better.];W[qf]LB[rg:a][sh:b]C[Wrong move, Black 'a' a simple kill.

White should play 'a', Black R14, white 'c'.];B[qm]C[N7 or N6 better ?

Black S13 or M7 to kill, White should resign at this point.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[km];W[mp];B[ln];W[mo];B[qn]C[Wasteful move, M3 will kill.]

C[White 'a' better.];B[nn]LB[kr:a][om:b]C[Well, this move loses about 8 points, when Black play 'a', White like it or not have to play 'b'.

In the same position, you put 1 more stone inside...];W[om]

;W[hn]C[Why not K2???

;W[dm];B[sj]LB[rg:a]C[Wrong way of killing, White 'a' alive.

White should play D1, this is huge as it's anti-sente 3 points, therefore 6 points in value.]
;B[ng]C[This is only 1 point.   E10 is 3 points or slightly more.]
;W[ej];B[fi]C[Black F11 is only 0.5 points, C1 is sente 3 points.

;W[ls];B[ns];W[ei];B[ms];W[mq]C[In conclusion, I feel that you should do more "death & alive" problems to improvement on your calculation.

At the same time, you should read up on end-game.   In tight games, usually it's the 1-2 points that separate the winner and the loser.

Hope you find my review helpful.
