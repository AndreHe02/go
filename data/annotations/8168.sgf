;B[pp];W[dc];B[dq];W[ce];B[ee]C[It is clearly intended to take control of the central region. I found it premature.

Q: Is this move too agressive?

Yes, because white already completed his shimari (D17, C15) in the corner, this move doesn't threaten the corner and can't be settled easily. Black's stone is floating in the middle of white strength. For now it's best to ignore it though, there are bigger areas on the board.]

(;W[cq];B[dp];W[cp];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]TR[cm][en][ep]C[Is white's shape in corner overconcentrated?

A bit, yes. You're being contained and forced to live, which is not a good look at this point of the game. More importantly though, white is not alive yet and black has serious cut points in his wall.]

Q: Is black ahead?

It depends on what happens to black's central influence. Cutting at F6 or K14 would have great results and would neutralize black's influence]

TR[jf][eg][cj][en][lq]C[White aims for the center.

Q: Is it the correct move at this moment?

Maybe. It's the correct idea, but the white stone is floating in black thickness, it is unclear that it'll be able to live without giving black a lot of territory. Black's center is very open. Better to push in through one of those openings. (See triangled moves)]

At this point black has already secured the right side. Some cuts and reductions sitll exist though (see triangled moves)]
