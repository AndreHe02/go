C[Hi, my name is Kevin.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask.   I am about kgs, chinese, egf 1d, and aga and tygem 2d, so I may be wrong about some things.  In this game, I feel that black was crushing white for most of the game, and was surprised how much white managed to catch up.  Black is way too passive in this game.  White, on the other hand made many mistakes in the opening, getting several weak groups, and ended up having to defend instead of being able to focus on getting points.]

This isn't a joseki, it seems like d3 is the only move here]

d10 would be a good move, but not necessarily needed, I think your move is fine.]

(;W[bq]C[I think this was bad. Nothing to gain in the corner, so I should have gone for the center. Or C7 to gain life quickly as I'm stuck in between two strong groups.

It would be easy to make life in the corner. The problem is, theres no way black will let you into it.  C7 would be slow because you still don't have two clear eyes after that, best to run at g6.]

That stone is most likely dead, but you can use p16 to use the aji, or find a way to use it later.

On the other hand, your extension is problematic because black can go right into it.]

White should definitely block the other direction, you have nothing here...]
