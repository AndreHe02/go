[nr:c]C[At this point, a white cut at "a" is not very good (can capture
one stone but b becomes very thick) so a direct response is not  necessary.  probably better to extend along the bottom  towards the left, perhaps to "b" or thereabouts.

How about "a" instead of the move played ("b").
In most cases, when white cross-cuts with a move  like the one played (E12), it is better not to  give atari like "b" or "c" because you form
weak groups on both sides of white's strengthend
cutting stone.  It is usually better to defend
the weaker of your groups, with a move like "a" or "d".]
