C[MAOR182 [7k\]: hi
Flameinice [8k\]: hi

H: Hello, I'm Hervï¿½, aka Giroro. My comments will be preceded by this H. Iw ill comment for both sides. I hope it will be useful.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[MAOR182 [7k\]: sry for the delay];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[qk];W[ce]C[Flameinice [8k\]: it's ok. ^^];B[jc];W[jq]C[Flameinice [8k\]: can we review afterwards?]
;B[fq];W[hq]
(;B[fo]C[MAOR182 [7k\]: if snyone from my family wont be needed the comp

H: This move makes white play D6, and now H3 is not alone, therefore the usual joseki cannot be played. Black's group will be weak. I would go in 3-3 point, here. See variation.]
;W[dn]C[Flameinice [8k\]: ok
Flameinice [8k\]: :)];B[fm]C[Flameinice [8k\]: maybe black could've been more aggressive

H: Black is in no position to be aggressive. run to the center is the good option.]
;W[mq]
(;B[ip]TR[dn][dp]C[H: When you play a move, ask yourself why you play it. Always. What is your purpose? 
In this situation, as white extended on the lower part, he is now solid as well as over concentrated, so you are right to think you can lie on them. But you're in no hurry to do so. You can keep that for when you need it. If white want to add a stone here, let him do he will only be more overconcentrated.
White omitted to strenghten the triangle stones. Maybe you can attack these ones. see variation for an example.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[mn]TR[dl]C[H : This move serves no purpose. Should be at triangle I guess.]
;B[lp]CR[po][pf]C[H: what do you want to do? Capture the stone white just played? You can just let him play in the middle if he likes, big points are in the corners and on the sides. Circles, for example.]

(;W[mp]C[H: I don't like this, see variation.];B[lq]C[H:];W[lr]
;B[kr];W[mr];B[kq];W[lo];B[ko]CR[jp]C[H: you can also simply play at circle to connect and capture three stones.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[jo]
(;B[km]C[Flameinice [8k\]: this was a mistake. Black should've just extended

H: yes, just get out simply. White will have to manage his weak group. Big mistake here, because you want to go too fast.
See variation for another possibility.];W[kn];B[jn];W[ln];B[in]
C[H: there no use in extending this stone. It is not a cutting stone, since the black lower groupe is captured. So, no need to save it. Just take sente and play elsewhere, it is more important.]
;W[po]CR[dl]C[Flameinice [8k\]: white uses his thickness

H : yes, but not sure how white 36 this could turn out. As white, I would still return and play circle at D8.
anyway, the result is a big loss for black. Not only because of the stones, but mainly because it hurts the chinese fuseki formation on the right.]
;B[qo];W[qn]
(;B[pn];W[qp];B[ro];W[pp];B[qm];W[rp];B[rn];W[on]CR[ml]C[H : this is small, white should take sente and play elsewhere. If white wants to get out, then play circle or something. But white should play elsewhere.

White has nearly 40 points at the bottom, so he has a strong lead. He should simply play on the left side, or approach top_right corner BEFORE strenghtening black like here.]
;B[om]CR[qk]TR[pf][dl]C[H : OK, well, white asked for it, so you can play it. But I'm a bit annoyed by the circle stone. black is overconcentrated. White can still get out.
So maybe play at triangle, to try to get new frameworks.];W[cj]
CR[dl]C[H : better at circle, but it's the right idea.];B[qq]
C[Flameinice [8k\]: maybe just sacrificing that stone was better

H: well, this stone is just dead, so you are just wasting ko-threats. Of course it is better to play elsewhere, you are right.]
;W[rq];B[oo];W[nn];B[oq];W[op];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs];W[ps];B[pr]
;W[os];B[sp]C[H : white does not need to answer this. He answered in the game, but what if he takes sente and plays elsewhere? Black has made a one point gote move.]
;W[sq];B[np];W[no];B[nq]C[H : same here, white can play elsewhere.]
;W[qs];B[ml]C[Flameinice [8k\]: black finally gives up and seals white off

H: I think there is too much aji here to call that "sealed in". If white plays above this black move (somewhere above, in the area), it is likely to be sente if you still want to seal white in. So in the end, white can reduce easily the moyo. But since black is way behing in points, it may be the right idea to aim for a really big territory here. Looks difficult, though.]

(;W[qf]TR[mi][li][lh][mh][ni][nh][oh][oi][oj][nj][mj][lj][lg]
[mg][ng][og][of][nf][mf][lf][le][me][ne][oe]C[Flameinice [8k\]: this approach was too close to white's thickness

H: you mean black's thickness?
This move looks ok to me, maybe I would have played on the fourth line.
Given the advantage of white in terms of points, maybe I would prefer to just erase the moyo in the triangle area, then go in the 3-3 point on the upper left corner, since it is still open.]
;B[qh]C[H: black is overconcentrated and allows white to go in the 3-3 point (given he has the lead, that would be a reasonable choice, even if it makes a big black moyo, it is still possible t reduce it thanks to the variation showed at last move.]

(;W[of]C[H: this is also a reasonable choice];B[pg];W[pf]
(;B[nh]C[H : I think this is the wrong side. Q16 looks weak now. See variation.]
;W[rd]C[H : I don't agree with this move. White should just get out]
;B[qc];W[nd];B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[mf]C[Flameinice [8k\]: good shape

H : maybe, but white has strengthened black on the upper side, and black is already strong in the middle.]
;B[md];W[me]C[Flameinice [8k\]: this move would've been better played at l14, although this group is more or less out of danger

H: yes the idea is to get out];B[je]LB[ld:a]C[H : good idea, but I'd rather play the simple move at A, scoring points and chasing white. The atari possibility is annoying.]
;W[gc]C[H : white is reckless, his group on the right is not alive yet.]
;B[rc]C[H: important move, very big.];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[sd]
;W[si]C[H : white, here, makes a few endgame moves... while his group is not yet alive. secure life first !]
;B[ri];W[sh];B[rh];W[sj];B[re];W[ej]C[Flameinice [8k\]: white's strategy is good, but right now his upper right group is in danger of being sealed in
Flameinice [8k\]: with only one eye

H; you are right. Therefore : seal him in !];B[lg]C[H : good.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[mg];B[mh];W[ld];B[mc];W[kg];B[lf];W[le];B[kf]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jd];B[id];W[jb];B[kd];W[lc];B[lb]C[H : sequence well player, black cleanly wiped out white.

Now I feel the game is close. Black has the lead in points, but if white plays D2 for example, it becomes.. err well, it's very difficult to say.]
;W[ke];B[jf]C[H : good move, you don't fall in the trap of connecting the atari.]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[ib];B[fd]C[Flameinice [8k\]: black tries to prepare for moyo expanding]
;W[fc];B[gd]TR[gj]C[H : not sente.  Triangle is the key point here to expand a big center black moyo.]
;W[hj]LB[gj:a]C[H : white takes advantage, but it should be one step closer, at A (you can see why later in the game]
;B[jj]C[H: well, it still looks ok for black, but imagine this stone at G10 instead of K10]
;W[ef];B[gi];W[gj];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk]LB[fg:a][dr:b]
[di:c]C[H: do not play this move. It is better to keep the peep for the other side at C, later. It has more reducing potential. This is a small endgame move. I'd rather play one of the following moves:
A for reducing even more white's territory, aiming at the C peep for example
B for the largest endgame move left.

B seems more important.];W[dj];B[ck]C[H : not important. One point, and damezumari (reducing your own liberties)]
;W[bk];B[en]C[H: and because you have played damezumari, you feel like you have to connect (which is a reasonable play, since it looks sente)]
;W[do];B[fj]
(;W[fi]C[Flameinice [8k\]: doing atari on the other side would've been better

H: I'm not sure it would be better.];B[fk]
(;W[hi];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg]C[Flameinice [8k\]: black uses a famous trick

H: yes, well played];W[gf];B[hh];W[ih];B[hf];W[ig];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[ge];W[fh];B[gf];W[ji]C[H : looks hopeless for white];B[ki]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[kj];B[li];W[jk];B[jg];W[jh];B[kk];W[ij]C[Flameinice [8k\]: living with the G10 group is extremely hard

H: indeed];B[lk]
(;W[hl]C[Flameinice [8k\]: playing at H8 might have produced better results. H8 looks too slow.

H : you mean H7? OK, I added some variations in yours. Please have a look at them.]

H: even though it is not needed, this is a pic-nic ko for black, a very good one.]
;W[ed];B[ns]LB[bj:a][bl:b][ei:c][ss:d][hc:e]C[Flameinice [8k\]: this is not a ko threat. It doesn't threaten to live. Playing at t1 or b8 would've been better.

H: you said it, not a ko threat. Ko threats are A to E for example.]
;W[de];B[nr]C[H : black cannot live here.];W[nl];B[nk];W[ka]
;B[qr]C[Flameinice [8k\]: white sees black's trap

H : if you know it is a trap, and you opponent can avoid it, then don't play the move. It is a general comment. You are wasting a ko threat, and you don't learn how to play well if you expect mistakes from your opponent.]
;W[ks];B[mb];W[rk]C[Flameinice [8k\]: white should find other areas to expand his territory. this is a useless move and black should have ignored it.

H: er, yeah, this white group is dead, white is just adding a prisoner for black.]
;B[rl];W[hd];B[he];W[hc];B[ek]C[Flameinice [8k\]: white resigns. Who had the upper hand?

H: Black has a 30 points lead.
This game was a bloodbath ;-)
Overall, I have a few main comments, or advices : 
1st) Try to ask yourself "what do I want to do with my next move?" then implement it.
2nd) play simpler move. Sometimes it is better to play solidly, then exploit the opponent's mistakes. It is not necessarily slow to play simple.

I hope this review helped.])
