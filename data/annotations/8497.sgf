C[Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review my game.  I played this game as black, and won on time at the end.  We had not finished securing all of our endgame points, and my lead was small, so it's possible that my opponent could have still won.

I have not played for very long, (this is maybe my 51st game on IGS) but I have done some research about the basics, and I do problems on my ipod.  I'm specifically interested in beginning moves that secure an advantage, but the more comments at all stages, the better =).  Please explain when I make mistakes, or where there is a better move.  Thanks again.]
;B[pd]C[Hi: My name is Paco. Im flinstone in KGS and my rank is 4k there. Feel free to ask me there or by email for more explanations.

As a general review:

1. You tend to have your stones separated, and create many weak groups

2. You like to attack, but dont calculate. So you get your stones captured, and sometimes you win because of luck. you should calculate more. Maybe you should play matches with more time, to play relaxed and with time to calculate.

3. You make many little or innecesary  moves. If a fight is over, look for the big point]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[nc];B[ce]C[F: I chose to approach the unbalanced corner before responding to his own approach
P: Is a matter of style. I would have play the same move or D15. Some people like to attack and other to make moyos. Some of them like to delete his oponent territory and other want big territory for themselves. Any style is correct.]
;W[dg]
(;B[fc]C[F: Perhaps attaching on the 4-4 point is better?  Then my stones are less likely to be cut.  Also maybe e16 would work.
P: There is a principle: Try to have your stones linked and theirs separated
You are making diferent separated groups that became weak can be attacked separately. This is bad. As a priciple: Dont have two weaks groups.]
(;W[hc];B[ee]C[F: Trying to cut off his corner stone, and take the corner myself
P: Is good to surround him and not to be surrounded. And is good to separate his stones and to link yours. But now is dificult to say what will happened. You entered in a complicated way of playing, so you dont know how it will end. At the end is good for you, but it was a matter of luck. This way you will not learn. Try to control your game.]
;W[ed];B[fd]C[F: Here I saw that he could form a tiger's mouth at d15, but I felt that my stones would be very weak, and have no potential base if he cut at f16.]
;W[de];B[cd]
(;W[ef]C[F: Not what I expected.];B[dd];W[fe];B[ec]C[P: You had luck. Now you win.]
;W[ee]C[P: Stupid move. Worth nothing. You take a big point and if there were a doubt about who win, now there is not]
;B[jq]C[F: Feeling secure in the upper corner, I felt that k3 was the next big point.

P: If I were a 17k player playing a championship match again another 17k, I would have play this, because the match is yours, and so you dont need to risk. Looking the whole board is a good move

But ussually the best move is the one that attacks. Try to attack whenever you can. In this situation, I would think the way to attack upside, but now I see that I would build a weak group myself so better wait for the best moment to attack, and take the big point. I would have played same as you]
;W[hq]
(;B[io]C[P: What's that move for? Moyo or attack. Is not a good attack so if you wanted to make territory better variation]
;W[dk]
(;B[cf]C[F: I think instead it would be better to take the last big side point, which neither of us do for a number of moves.
P: Sure. C14 is the typical useless bad move. What for? You are already alive, and it takes sooooo little territory]
;W[cg]
(;B[bg]C[P: Another typical mistake: weak player always answer. C13 is not a threat, you need not to answer. Look at the whole board]
;W[bh];B[af]C[P: Again little];W[he]C[F: Again, now would have been an opportunity for me.]
(;B[gp]C[P: When the fight you are starting ends, what will you have win? He will asure territory and you will make a wall that will not give you territory. You have better ways to reduce his territory there]
;W[gq];B[fq]C[F: It would have been better to stretch here to f4, I think.]
;W[fp];B[hp];W[eq];B[fr];W[gr];B[fo];W[ep];B[em]C[F: Trying to push into his side]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[cn]
(;B[en];W[cl];B[el];W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[P: See the amout of territory he has got];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[pj]C[P: unacceptable. Its been there all the match and you let him take it]
(;B[pg]C[F: I thought approaching from above would force him into a smaller group than if I approached from my lower group
P: you are driving him toward reduce your posible moyo downside]
;W[qm];B[qi]C[F: Here I was trying to squeeze more, but would attachment at r8 be possible as well?  I understand that attaching makes both stones stronger, but would I have the better position with my nearby stones?]
;W[qj]

;W[oi];B[oh]C[P: Little];W[ni];B[ne]C[P: Again you drive him toward close territory without getting anything for you]
;W[md];B[me];W[le];B[od];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[pa];B[qa]
;W[nb];B[on];W[om];B[nm];W[ok];B[nl];W[nk];B[ol]C[F: I saw this move as an opportunity to extend into his area later if he did not respond after saving his stone in atari.]
;W[pm]
(;B[pn]C[P: Litle];W[lk];B[ll];W[kl];B[kk]C[F: We both had some stones nearby, but I thought a cross cut would be to my advantage because there are no ladder breakers for his L8 stone if he puts my top stone in atari.]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[ml];B[lm];W[mm];B[mn]C[F: That was the outcome I wanted.]
;W[mk];B[km]C[P: Not necesary];W[jl];B[il];W[jj];B[ik];W[hi]
(;B[gj]C[P: little];W[gi];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg]
(;B[lh]C[F: Here I saw the possibility of a series of ataris, and if he did not respond well, then I might be able to break into his upper side area.
P: The cutting point of M16 is interesting.];W[mi]
(;B[lf];W[kg];B[ld];W[lc];B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[jd];B[je];W[if]
;B[id];W[ic];B[hd]C[F: Instead of this move, would L17 potentially cause more damage?]
;W[ie];B[gd];W[gc];B[fb];W[gb];B[ga]C[F: I think I got a bit too greedy here, and should have just secured the corner.
P: Yes, you like to fight, but you dont calculate];W[jb];B[ha]
C[F: Time was running low for both of us at this point, which was unfortunate because I think that this was a key point in the game.  At this point, I was still focused on the L17 point, and wondering if I could make use of it somehow.]
;W[ia];B[hb]C[F: I thought that by curling in, I could take the L17 point, and maybe capture some of the stones on the side, but again, time was an issue, so I didn't have much time to think.
 P: You have problems too with your group. He can play F19, and after J18...Now H18 is not sente, so I would play elsewhere]
(;W[kb];B[nd]C[F: This was probably a mistake, and I should have secured my stones in danger first.
P: Is a question of calculation. You have to calculate if a move is necesary or not. Nowis necesary to play on the upper left. Is bad not to play a neceary move, but also is bad to play an unnecesary move. So you have to calculate]
;W[db];B[cb]C[F: When I saw his move, I thought I had lost the game badly, but I would try to at least save the corner.]
(;W[ib];B[eb];W[da];B[cc];W[fa];B[ca]C[F: He thought for a long time as time was running down, and only needed to make 3 moves in one minute I believe.  I felt that I was more pressed for time than he was, as I had maybe 2 minutes left to make 10 moves.

After that final exchange, and considering all the areas I could possibly push into his territory, the score estimator said I would have won by approximately 24 points, (I think if I were to keep sente).  I enjoyed this game because when I play, whoever wins usually does by a substantial margin, and I felt this was a close game.  I would love to hear critiques of specific moves that are poor, or too aggressive/passive, but also any overall tips for improving my play.  Thank you so much for reviewing my game, I'm sure it will be very helpful!]
