C[Hi - I'll try to preface all my comments by YOG (yearofglad is my ID on IGS, where I play).  I'll try to address your questions.

On a first glance through the game, black seems very scattered and unfocused, but you, as white, seemed like you felt you had to respond to every move that black made.  This is, in effect, letting black control the 
tempo of the game and maintain sente throughout.  Not good.  Especially with you starting as white, you need to try to get control of the game from black.  Let's have a look:]
;B[jj]C[YOG:  I don't care for this move at all - it seems like black has given you a chance early on here to even up the game.  The initial moves should be close to the corners - that's the most efficient use of stones early in the game and where the bulk of territory will be made.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[nq]C[YOG:  I think this is fine up to here.  One issue with approaching on this side, rather than around R6, is that you're allowing black to use that center stone to create a large right-side territory.  Still, though, I think this O3 is just fine.]
;B[no];W[lp]C[YOG: The traditional move for white here is Q2, to get near the corner.]
;B[lo];W[pr];B[kp]C[I expected him to try to save the corner.

YOG:  So did I.  The thing is, you can't have it both ways - you attacked the corner, and black ignored it, but then so did you.  If you want to attack the corner, which is sort of the point of a move like Q2, then continue on.  Don't worry about one little stone at M4.  Back to my opening comment, the corners are where most of the territory is made.

Plus, white R3 almost forces black to respond - in other words, it gives you (white) the control, sente.

Plus, R3 settles your corner group, pretty much, making it almost indestructible.]
;W[kq]C[YOG:  I think this is too aggressive - your stones are already spaced out pretty far, and you're isolating M4.  You'll note that your weak group of stones here gets cut apart.  Just because black is playing overly 
aggressive (he is!), don't respond in kind.  Black's over-aggressiveness will come back to haunt him if you play solid moves.  I know that it might seem slow at the time, but building on a strong foundation is important.]
;B[mp];W[lq];B[mq]C[Here is an example of my opponent picking on a group.
My first instinct is to defend but it just left a weak group, and lots of infuence for black is there a better way?

YOG:  Here, I think a move like R3, which /should/ force a response from black, and then a move like K4, which should force a response as well.  Yes, black can split your groups, but hopefully you'll have a couple 
settled groups by the time it's all said and done.  See the variations on the next move.]

(;W[mr];B[jq];W[jr];B[jp];W[ir];B[gp]C[White has a weak goup on the bottom. He did this in the game after this how do I prevent this?

YOG:  I think the variation presented earlier is a good start.  Plus, the corner is still a huge, huge point in terms of making territory for white and attacking black at the same time.  Note that black's group isn't terribly, 
terribly strong, either, and you should be able to use some of black's weaknesses to gain some leverage.]

(;W[qf]C[YOG:  Probably a decent move.  You're right to think that you need to invade the right side.  I may have done it further down - see variation.]
;B[pj];W[rd]C[Here I try to invade  a few times, but only create a few small groups

YOG:  This is the right move here.];B[qg]C[YOG:  This move is a mistake by black and should be punished.  If you're worried about him sealing off the side, you're correct, and that's probably what black is aiming at.  I'd either take the corner or, since in a couple moves you try to invade the lower right, I'd press on with a move like S13.  Yes, it's a low move, but maybe the best you'll get.]
;W[qc];B[qe];W[re]C[YOG:  I think the biggest issue I see for white in this game is indecision.  In the lower right, you played Q2 expecting to see black defend the corner, but then when he didn't, you didn't invade, anyway, so it's just /like/ he defended the corner.

Here, you attack the corner with R17, which is good, but then retreat to try to rescue your single stone at R14.]
;B[pf];W[pm]C[YOG:  And, when he continues to attack R14, the stone you just played towards in order to protect it, you don't finish the protection - you let him capture.

One of the biggest things I learned about go when I was your level is that you can't have your cake and eat it too.  Be decisive!  If you want to protect the stone at R14, do that.  If you want to invade the lower right, do that.  If you want to attack the position around R3, do that.  But, if you try to do all 3 things at once, you're going to come up short all around.

Remember that when you are attacking, you're fighting an uphill battle.  You have to get all your forces working together - this game is more an example of your army charging a hilltop castle one soldier at a time.

One word of warning, though - even when you pick a battle to fight, it might be a losing battle.  That's the real challenge - knowing which battles to fight and which to let go.  That's something I have little idea about.]
;B[rf];W[qo];B[ql];W[qp]C[YOG:  This is good for white.  He's letting you into that side territory.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[or]
(;W[qr]C[YOG:  I think this is the move to make - yes, you're going to lose a little on the bottom edge, but you've got the capability to make that group live as well.]
;B[oq];W[nr]C[here he splits me.];B[ns];W[np];B[oo];W[mo]C[YOG:  Good - moving up to O4 is a good play.]
;B[mn];W[jd]C[YOG:  This move is ok.  I can't decide if I would have continued to fight in the lower right.  I think you probably made a good choice - both those groups are pretty settled - there's still work to be done with them, but not now.]
;B[gd]C[Here he invaded what is the best response.

YOG:  A note about your mindset.  He didn't "invade" with G16, because it isn't your territory.  It might seem like semantics, like nitpicking, but keeping in mind that you don't have any territory on the top right now is important - if you think it's your territory, you end up trying to defend it all at once, which you can't do.

As for the best response...  That's tough.  Look at some variations on the next move.]

(;W[fc]C[YOG:  Understand that this move is defending the corner, which is good, but is going to automatically push black towards your white stone at K16.

In retrospect, perhaps playing K16 a little closer to one of the corners would have been better.]
;B[pb];W[pc];B[oc];W[qb];B[hc];W[ob]C[YOG:  This is good.  You decided to attack that stone, and carried through.  White maintains sente through this sequence, and maybe provides some leverage to K16...]
;B[nb];W[pa];B[nc]
(;W[dg]C[YOG:  This stone is too far out.  The two-space jump is primarily used on the third (C) line, not the fourth.  A simple one-space jump is much more effective here, although any more supporting the corner is making it really difficult on your K16.  I would recommend continuing to attack the two black stones, as shown in the variation.

When you play D13, again, you're trying to have it both ways.  You started this sequence concerned about K16, but then abandoned that.]
;B[pn];W[qn]C[YOG:  This is a wasted move.  You have to assume, here, that black will respond with R7, so white's gain is very minimal.  Don't feel like you have to respond to the black stone - especially when it's a losing battle.  Take a moment, think a few moves ahead, and determine whether you'll really gain anything by playing R6.  If not, like in this case, use black's short attention span against him and work on those black stones on the upper side!  He's given you two moves in a row up there - take advantage!]
;B[qm];W[ln]C[YOG:  This, I think, is a further example of how you've let black distract you - you seem to have totally forgotten about the upper half of the board and are now playing moves for which black has very, very easy responses.]
;B[mp];W[jf]C[I try to use that stone but it is really weak.
Maybe I should have defendedon the left

YOG:  Here, good to see you getting back to the upper side.  A couple of notes about the stone you played:

1) Most eyes for groups are made along the edges of the board, not in the center.  If you want to save this stone, play near the edge and try to establish at least one eye there.

2) This move doesn't attack the two weak black stones, and it should.

Try to find a move that establishes a base and, at the same time, attacks black.  The previous variations (W: J17, and W: P15) are still usable.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[gg]
(;W[if]C[YOG:  See variation here - black is spread out, so try to cut him.]
;B[jh]C[YOG:  As is, even though you didn't see J16, you get yet another chance to cut black.]
;W[mf]C[YOG:  When you played J14, I assume you were trying to attack black, yet here you back off and play an ineffective floating stone.  Continue your attack!  Be decisive and persistent!]
;B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[lh];B[kg];W[kf];B[lg]
(;W[mg];B[lf];W[he]C[YOG:  This move, or something like it, should have been made long ago.]
;B[hf];W[id];B[ge];W[hd];B[gc];W[jg];B[kh]C[I try to live and escape but fail maybe I should have just picked one group or plan?]

;B[kc];W[md];B[ke];W[me];B[mc]
(;W[lb]C[YOG:  This one too.  Believe me, I understand when you're trying to get a group free, getting frustrated and just playing stones, but always pause to think about each move.  I know it's hard to do - you have my sympathy.  However, moves like M18 that are clearly doomed take the place of of moves like J11 that could save your group.]

C[YOG:  This move is in the middle of nowhere - it's too far away to protect the corner.]
;B[po];W[in];B[gn];W[gm];B[hn];W[hm];B[im]C[Here I resign maybe to early, but I was intimidated and irritated. Part of the mind part of go that I have to overcome. But is there any way to come back?

YOG:  I think your resignation was probably fitting, unfortunately.  White's going to lose this game unless black makes a gigantic mental error, which doesn't make for a satisfying win, anyway.  I don't think even the best player could come back against this handicap.

OVERALL COMMENTS:  As I pointed out, the biggest problem in this game was lack of decisiveness.  You really, really let black push you around.  Ask yourself, before responding to an opponent's move:

"What happens if I /don't/ respond to this move?"

If the answer is nothing, or maybe you lose a couple points but there's a move elsewhere on the board that is worth 30 points, than the choice is easy.

Also, if the answer is that you'll lose a corner group, or any decent-sized group, for that matter, then you'd probably best respond.

When responding, then, the key is to try to find a response that, in turn, forces the opponent to respond.  Always try to choose your moves to direct the action.

Losing a single stone or a few stones here and there aren't terribly important AS LONG AS you're able to recoup your losses elsewhere when you ignore those moves.

But again, be decisive.  You had some good ideas in this game, but they all got spread out because you tried to incorporate every possible attack at once.

Black made the same mistake as you, really - he attacked all over the place.  The reason it worked for him and not for you is because:

a) he was in control of the flow of the game, and thus:

b) he always made the first, attacking move in each instance, meaning you were left to respond, and thus fight an uphill battle.]

;W[ml]C[YOG:  Again, this sequence is unlikely, but you can see that it creates some interesting possibilities.

Of course, even if this sequence were to play out, white is way behind on the right, but keep in mind that on the left hand side, black has yet to play a stone.  There's no reason to think that white couldn't end up doing, on the left, just as well as black did on the right.]

Don't be frustrated if you didn't see what is maybe the key move here, playing J16 instead of J14 - just practice.]

(;W[pc]C[YOG:  This might seem to be leaving the stone at K16 all alone.  However, G16 isn't too powerful all by itself, and this play should require a response by black, which maybe we can use for leverage on the other side.]

(;W[hc]C[YOG:  The advantage here is that you're pushing black towards the corner.  Why is this an advantage?

By being near the corner, D16 is automatically stronger than K16.  Since D16 is stronger, it can better withstand black approaching it.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[ed];W[de]C[YOG:  Just one quick example of how things might play out.  Ultimately, you're not going to kill black's G16 stone, most likely, so the best you can do is try to strengthen both your groups.  You have two things to use to your advantage:

1) The corner, which automatically gives strength to D16.

2) The white stones in the upper right.  Here, you have to be a little careful because those stones aren't that strong, but they can be used for some leverage.]
