C[==in this game I (brett1138) played black and lost by about 20 points.

==I feel like I put up a good fight, but have the inkling sensation
==that she was really in control the whole time.

==my main concern is the endgame.
==i feel like it was what broke the balance.
==i couldn't find enough to reduce her lead, but
==she was probably already too far ahead by that time,
==but i felt like i couldn't catch a break.


mjh [8k\]: hi
brett1138 [9k\]: hi : )
brett1138 [9k\]: have a good game];B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[jd]
;W[fq];B[hq]C[==I'm branching out here with a pincer... I'm not used to them.
==What do you think of the result?

This is good however black should play more solid when there is a rank difference because complications are better for white. On he other hand if you like aggresive play it is ok but have to keep your concentration up]
;W[fo]C[Many possiblities];B[dn];W[ho];B[kp];W[jn];B[np]C[==perhaps o3 would've been better?

it dependes on your plan
if you want to settle and take some territory right away 03, but if you plan on keeping the pressure on white o4 is ok but more difficult and complicated]
;W[or]C[p3 destroys any chance to make territory on the lower side
black has to take compensation elsewhere

m7 is a posiblity to keep the pressure on white and then r6 if white jumps]

(;B[nr];W[nq]C[donÂ´t let white take the corner that easy]
(;B[mq];W[oq];B[dj]C[==as soon as i played this i thought i should've been at q10

again depends on what was your plan. Do not play just the next move Try to plan ahead to your limit. At least have a general plan of what you want to accomplish]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[mo];B[pj]C[==i felt like i had done a good job of grabbing some of the right side.
==her shape seemed a bit too big over there. . .

==though now that i look at it that's a fairly greedy thought.
==but i could tell i was outranked.

The main problem is that the lower balck stones are not settled and that would be a great loss.]

;W[jq]C[==here's where i started to feel like the whole game
==was going to be a reduction game.

==that also says to me that i was probably greedy during fuseki

careless is a better word];B[jp];W[mr];B[lr];W[ns];B[jr]C[Actually good for black except that white keeps sente]
;W[pm]C[this is a wasted move by white playing too close to his own strength a chance for black to take sente back]

(;B[nj]C[this is a missed chance by black. White keeps sente and n10 accomplish nothing]
;W[qc]C[this is a bad move for white. It makes n10 a good move]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]
(;B[rc];W[rb]C[==somebody tried to teach me a thing that looks like the following once. . .
==i think i missed the idea though]
(;B[qb]C[extremely bad idea by black. Too many cut points on black shape and r18 is gote at the end because s17 is exposed]
;W[pb];B[ra]C[Black completely out of concentration. Better to resign now if you are tired]
;W[qa]
(;B[sb]C[more senseless moves. Should take sente in exchange for this gift to white]
;W[mc];B[qb];W[md]C[Take the corner]
(;B[oe]C[==So that was a disaster. . .
==I still have a chunk on the right but it is squashed now.]
;W[rb]C[Now fight the ko]
(;B[rd]C[Black fighting spirit is gone. NO need to go further.]
;W[sa];B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb];W[ch]C[==i'm bad with counting too...
==i thought this was a pretty fair exchange,
==though white has eaten a bunch of the left side now.];B[hd]
C[==this was dumb. . .
==could've I stretched better at perhaps g17?
==or elsewhere?];W[jb];B[hb];W[og]C[==there's got to be a good defense against that!
==(other than play it first)

==though i probably should've seen it cming after k3];B[qh]

;W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[fl];W[qf]C[==ugh!!  i didn't defend strongly enough...
==she was simply a better player i think];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[ph];B[rh];W[qk];B[qj];W[bj]C[==these seem like small points to me at first, these plays on the second line. . .
==but that doesn't mean i know how to work that to black's advantage, any thoughts?]
;B[dr];W[qe];B[re]C[==someone later suggested that i should've played q14 early in the game.
==I thought it was too small.  am i missing something?];W[bl]
