C[Hi, I have won this game but I realize I've done some mistakes and could be really bigger sometimes. Please comment it. :)
Thanks in advance.

P.S. Also I have left some questions for you in process. You won't miss it.

am> Hello, my name is Arnauld and I'll try to do my best to help you understanding the game.
To help you improve, 2 advices :
1/ try to see where you can grab the more points on the board. Sometimes, you focus on local situations with very poor gains to expect
2/ do some tsumego to improve your fighting skills];B[pd]C[Hi, I have won this game but I realize I've done some mistakes and could be really bigger sometimes. Please comment it. :)

LB[op:A]SQ[iq][mq]C[i suppose this was a wrong move... cause this stones mekes a good base for pincering.

what do you think?

am> I do not like this move because black can extend from is 2 stones while pincing white.
I would'nt like a black move on 'A' which would make a strong position for black, so your idea to approach the corner seems good. But, instead of a white low approach which will be difficult for living or escaping, I prefer a move on 'A' to reduce black moyo and to escape more easily.]
;B[lq]
(;W[oo]C[am> Ok, you choose to escape, but black can make lot of profit (see variation)]

(;B[pp]LB[pn:A]C[am> strange move : Black gains nothing white is strenghtened. He should have played 'A'.]
;W[op];B[qn];W[om]LB[lo:A]C[am> I would prefer A to try to make some eye shape. But I think your move is ok as it put pressure on black on the right.]
;B[pn]LB[on:A]C[am> You played 'A' and it's ok. But you should think about some other sequences]

(;W[on]C[am> ok];B[qj];W[pl]LB[lo:A]C[am> I would prefer a move around A to make some eye shape.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[nc]C[am> ok, but beware that your big group is still floating. But stabilising it is not urgent, so your move is the good one.]
;B[lc];W[qf]SQ[qj]C[a modification of a standart joseki, but i am not sure if this move was right because of a wrong direction (square)

Please leave a comment

am> It would be joseki without squared stone but it's still playable and I think it's still joseki ;-)]
;B[oe]C[seems to be a mistake.. not joseki move

am> no, it's good move. Black split white and it will be hard for you now.]

;W[ml]LB[lk:A]C[am> better here];B[mj]LB[cf:A]C[am> not very effective... Black should do something around 'A' to reduce your moyo.]

I stop my comment here.

It was a bit difficult to comment that game because of the style you both played : lot of fights.]
