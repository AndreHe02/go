C[In this game white wins easily following a mistake by black where
he looses a large group in top left corner. Black will improve
his game if he makes a general principle to have only one weak
group at a time .. so if you have two weak groups then make it
a prority to strengthen one of the groups. Black does some good
middle game moves that have potential to cause difficulty for
white.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[cd]C[by attaching to c15 white helps black better to either pincer
on 4th line or f/g 16];B[de]C[I felt this was a strong result from encroachment for me]
;W[ch]LB[eg:4][ff:3][fe:2][gd:A][ed:1]C[This move obviously attacks my future eye space, though I did
not fully realize it at the time. Perhaps jumping to 1,2,3, or
4 would have been more prudent than the move A that I made

White's move is too agressive .. gives black many chances now
to cayse problems for white - see variation for one possible
reponse ...]
(;B[gd]C[Too loose for black and losses advantage];W[ed];B[ee]

[bf:A]C[but I used aji to help out my smaller group...i should have realized
that I could have possibly used this time to help my larger,
more immediately hurting group with something like A,B,C or D,
or possibly something better that you can see];W[be];B[bf];W[ae]
;B[af];W[ad]
(;B[cf]C[obviously not a great result];W[fb]C[Not good move by white as has no purpose .. white doesn't need
more eye space .. if he wants to attacke this blck group better
to do it from l16 say or extend g15 to h15];B[gc];W[gf]C[f17 helped black .. now white has a heavy g16 group. Better move
for black is to cap c12 .. attack not to kill but to make territory]

(;B[ff];W[ie];B[jc];W[md]C[h17 group is priority now as it can be attacked]

(;B[qf];W[qe];B[qi]C[Good move by black];W[nq]C[I feel that I responded to this encroachment poorly. I have had
success in the past with the high pincer, but I do not feel that
I am using it to its real purpose. Any advice from the sequence
shown?];B[lp]C[Good pincer by black .. extends well from d4]
;W[no];B[pn];W[ln];B[jq];W[fq]C[Already feeling weak about my skill with the pincer, and the
overal position in general, I felt it best to fall back

good idea];B[cn];W[ck];B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B[fh];W[dm]LB[gi:B]
[fi:D][hh:A][gg:C]C[Here I should have taken the opportunity to jump into the center
with my nearly enclosed group in the top left with something
like A, B, C, or D];B[eq];W[eo]MA[kd][jo]C[c14 group will live so black does not need to be concerned

The 2 weakest groups are h17 and k3 so they should be priority
... always defense before attack];B[gj]C[Really this was just a bad move]

C[arg [10k\]: ouch

Here I really got it];B[jh]C[good move by black   it all gets very complicated now and is
impossible to work out what is really best. Game will result
in a liberties struggle over d15 group versus j15 group. Looks
to me as if it could go either way.];W[ih];B[kd]

Any advise on how to better manage ko threats as, despite my
losing situation, I felt that i had very few places I coudl really
threaten with two sequential moves.

Too difficult a situation for black to get advantage from a ko

ko threats otherwise it gives your opponent the chance to elimante
any single ko threats you may have];W[lf];B[lg];W[ma];B[js]
