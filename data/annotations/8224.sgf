C[Hello, dear reviewer!
Thank you very much for taking your time to review this game.
I played black and won by 5,5 points. This is one of my first games as 1 kyu KGS, and I would like so much to confirm this level and to start a challenge to 1 dan ^^
So I'll be very thankfull for any comments about my mistakes and the ways to improve. There are some questions and thoughts about the game, but please, feel free to comment wherever you find it necessary.
Thanks again in advance!

/Igor' (Crazyone on KGS)

P.S.: sorry for my bad english!

LB[qo:A][qn:B]C[Crazyone: I was waiting for white r6 and this move was a bit strange to me. Shimari looked natural, so  I played A. Maybe B was more active?

Az: Shimari is definetly the right idea here. Either 'a' or 'b' is ok in my opinion, though I might prefere 'a' since it is tighter.]
;B[qo];W[qh]LB[nc:A]C[Az: Defending the corner is appropriate, but 'a' is a more positive way to do so. The move in game doesn't put any pressure on white (too much open space), and doesn't give you any way to develope the corner more in the future. This is the first mistake in the game.]
;B[qf];W[cj]SQ[qk][qh]C[Crazyone: White stones look not very strong, but in the game I gained a little from attacking them. Maybe you could show, when was the right time and what was the right direction to attack them?

Az: Simple answer: you can't attack them right now. White may not be 100% alive, but they are not very weak either. You need to wait and use the threat of attacking them later in the game, you can't force the issue.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[jc];W[go]
(;B[hq]C[Crazyone: I like to play solid, but sometimes my moves are to passive. Is h3 ok, or it was better to play some bigger move?

Az: This is too passive. What are you afraid of here? If w plays h3 you can always invade the corner. If you must answer, G4 is better since it comes closer to forcing white to reply.]
;W[ge];B[hd]C[Az: Again, the corner is open so you don't need to fear the invasion. B has played passively on both sides now.]
;W[oq]C[Crazyone: maybe this invasion is a bit early? I was very afraided of white g10.

Az: As well you should be, a white move somewhere in the center would be very potent. This isn't a bad move for white, just maybe a little bit early, it depends how he continues.]
;B[pp];W[lq]C[Crazyone: I think, that it was better for w to play q2-q3 exchange first.

Az: Yeah, though either way you're going to have a hard time attacking here since white is light.]
;B[nq];W[jq]LB[nq:A][jq:B]C[Crazyone: Hmm... Wasn't it more sever to play B  instead of A by myself?

Az: No. 'B' is not a very strong attacking move and its way too close to your own stones. 'A' was an ok move, but there just limits to what you can do here since you don't have a lot of thickness.]
;B[ko];W[mp];B[mn]C[Crazyone: anyway, the white group don't have two eyes, so I hope to build some thickness in the center by attacking it and then invade white moyo on the left.

Az: The plan is good.];W[np];B[op];W[nn];B[nm];W[mo];B[ln];W[on]
(;B[qm]C[Crazyone: this way I let white go out, but I hope to split 2 w groups, and attack the right side later. But maybe there was some better move, than r7 (p7 for example)?

Az: You were doing well until this move, where things fall apart. See variation.]
;W[om];B[pl]C[Az: This is a disaster, now your stones in the center look weak and white is all but safe. The two on the right are not heavy, and white could just give them up for aji.]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[ol];B[pk]
(;W[pj]C[Az: This is greedy for white, he should have defended the center and changed to pressure your group.]
;B[oj];W[pi];B[lk];W[nj];B[ok];W[nk];B[ni];W[mj];B[ki];W[mi]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[kh]
(;B[lf]C[Crazyone: maybe this move is a bit insonsistent, but I think, that w is ran out anyway and so it's better to stop attack and gain some profit on the top, than to push w group inside my moyo. Am I right?

Az: I don't like this at all. It is not enough to take any solid profit, and it gives away control of the center to white. This is quite a bad move.]
;W[ji]C[Crazyone: but this hane is very paintful for black.

Az: This move should be enough all by itself to prove that M14 was a mistake.]
;B[kj];W[jg]LB[rk:A][ri:B]C[Crazyone: Now A look too soft to me. Was it possible to kill white, maybe starting from B?]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[ql];W[qj];B[rl];W[rg];B[ri]C[Crazyone: heh, in the game I misread here. It was better just to block at s14.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qe];W[sh];B[re];W[sf];B[ih]TR[lf]C[Crazyone: from this move I start a very dubious sequence, trying to live in this area, but the things didn't went well for black. I think, that middle-game fighting is my weakest part of the game, so will greatly appreciate any advices about ongoing fight.

Az: Part of the problem is that black should have never gotten in this situation, it is not good for him. The marked move earlier was terrible, which makes doing anything interesting here almost impossible.]
;W[jh];B[hj]LB[gm:A]C[Az: This is an overplay, pure and simple. You can't attack white so directly, white is way too strong. Something around 'a' might be more possible.]
;W[ik];B[hn]TR[hj][ik]C[Az: The exchange is clearly bad now.]
;W[hk];B[ij]C[Az: More overplays. Black is flailing around wildly with no plan, this is horrible.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[jl];B[kk];W[gk];B[hf];W[hh];B[gj]C[Az: More unreasonable moves.]
;W[hg];B[fk];W[fl];B[gl];W[gm];B[il];W[hl];B[im]
(;W[gn]C[Crazyone: ok, I gained a few points in the center, but solidified whites grate moyo. This exchange is clearly bad for b, but at least I keep sente.

Az: You only kept sente because white choose to pass. If white doesn't play this move you can't do anything to him!]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db]LB[cd:B][eb:A]C[Crazyone: I think, it was much better for w to play B to protect a lot of points on the left side and to take sente.

Az: For sure.];W[eb];B[bb];W[da];B[cb];W[ec];B[bf];W[cf];B[be]
;W[bg];B[cq];W[cp]TR[gn]C[Crazyone: as far, as I can see, this is the losing move for white. Black got too much points in the corner.

Az: White should have had an easy win, his loosing move was passing and giving up his corners (blocking on the wrong side in the upper left didn't help either).]
