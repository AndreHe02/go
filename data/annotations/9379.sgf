C[Here is a game from the Dragon Go Server correspondence ladder tournament.  It has given me the opportunity to play even games with very strong players and I'd like to make the most of the learning experience.  My main question is on how to reduce the left side.  Even after white 30, I feel black should be able to live.  I, however, died.  Would the fourth line have been better?  How would you proceed?  Any other choices?  I tried to make the most of the aji, but feel the game was lost.  Any other comments or ideas would be appreciated.
   Best,
     Nathan

Forfun (hereafter 'ff') - Hi Nathan! Thanks for giving us an interesting game to look at. Unfortunately the game is effectively decided rather early but we can still find some good learning points along the way. I have concentrated on the play before the invasion and how Black handled the play following the invasion. 

If there is one overall comment that I think applies to Black, it is that you are playing patterns that you have seen without really thinking about. This applies to the original fuseki (micro-Chinese or whatever it is called) and to the invasion itself. I don't want to claim that I know them all. I had to go and check some games with that fuseki since I don't use it myself. Also I had to study some invasions as well. I learned alot and hope I can pass some of it on :-)

The point is that Black should have been able to get more out of the position. Go is all about strengths and weaknesses and Black did not pay enough attention to White's weaknesses. We can not efficiently build up our strengths if we are not aware of our opponent's weaknesses and make use of them. Let's see what I mean...]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf];B[lc]C[ff - Black plays a very popular fuseki...]
;W[qj]C[ff - White answers in the most popular way.]
(;B[fq]C[ff - Black turns away from the main scene of action. In choosing any variation of the mini-Chinese, Black sets out to construct a loose but fast framework on the top and right side of the board. When White enters at R10, we should be thinking that White is outnumbered four to one on the top and right. There will never be a better chance for Black.

In my pro game database there are 448 games with this position. Black approaches the stone on the right side from the bottom in 431 of them (see the variations). There are only two games where Black plays against the bottom left. Playing at F3 is not a 'bad' play. However, it is definitely not typical. It gives White the chance to take the initiative on the right side.]

(;W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[ff - There are two things about this play that Black should consider carefully. The first is that it will inevitably end in gote, leaving White free to play first on the right. That is not so good in the context of this game. However, in more general terms, Black should not want to 'force' White to play C3. When White answers here, it establishes the anchor for a very strong fighting shape. Remember this for reference in the future. White's C3 is a fighting move! This may seem strange since we consider the exchange of D2 for C3 so normal.]
;W[cq];B[iq]
(;W[dj]C[ff - This is almost certainly a mistake by White. The reason is that with the stones now on C3 at the bottom and C14 at the top, White has no reason to avoid a fight on the left side. In addition, D10 still does not prevent Black from invading the left as in the game. See the variation.]

(;B[fe]C[ff - Black returns the favor. This is not the pivotal point on the board. See the variations...]
;W[qf]
(;B[od]C[ff - This seems too passive. The Black shape at the top looks strange now. At this point we have to ask, "Why did Black jump to F15?"]

(;W[of]C[ff - A tight move by White, but it is not clear what would be White's follow up. See the variation...]

(;B[qn]
(;W[ql]C[kk - White makes a very tight move, too tight. This hands the initiative back to Black]

(;B[oi]C[ff - This can not be good. Black makes White even stronger, which is not necessarily bad. But meanwhile, the P11 stone can not connect naturally to either the top or the bottom. It becomes a target. Its most likely fate is to be absorbed by White, which is a loss for Black and a gain for White. This is better left unplayed.]
;W[ph]
(;B[nf]C[ff - Black wants to wall off the top. This is not a bad idea but in doing so, Black should think about the left side. What does Black want to do on the left? If Black wants to invade the left, now seems to be the time, before White can strengthen it further. In the game, White responds to Black's attempt to enclose the top with the play at F13, which both limits the Black top and expands/strengthens the White left. 

It seems better for Black to decide to commit to enclosing the top and recognise that the best way to go about it is to start on the left because the left is more open than the right.]
;W[ng];B[mf];W[oe];B[nd];W[mg]
(;B[lf]C[ff - This is too passive, Black needs to hane here...]
;W[fg]C[ff - In the last few plays, White has suddenly come to dominate the board. Black has not gotten enough out of the top. So we have to invade the left after all?]

(;B[cl]C[ff - This would be the standard invasion point in this position.]
;W[dl]C[ff - White's attachment is the most common response. Now how does Black plan to live?]

(;B[ck]C[ff - This is a standard idea and Black should be able to produce a reasonable result.]

(;W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[dk];W[ek]
(;B[bk]C[ff - However, this move is too heavy and ignores Black's potential on the side. Black has to be more postive here. White still has defects that allow Black to invade. In all invastions we need to be able to think about how to use them. There are books that will tell us, pro games that will show us, and our own experience that will allow us to accumulate a practical examples (not to mention GTL reviews of course!) :-)]
;W[el]
(;B[bm]C[ff - This is dead. There simply isn't enough space for eyes.]
;W[bn];B[al];W[aj]C[ff - Black dies for basically no compensation.]

(;B[jp]C[ff - If Black really wanted to finish off the bottom, this seems more natural here. I leaves White less developed and therefore makes it easier to play C8 for example. It also leaves behind the 3-3 invasion at C3, which is more valuable when White has played D6 than when White has played C6.]

(;B[qn]C[ff - The main reply at the professional level is the small knight move here. Black pushes White toward the top but from a distance. Black wants to limit White's counter chances on the bottom in case the fighting at the top strengthens the White stones.]
