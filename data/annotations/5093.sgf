C[Hi Reviewer,
 Thank you for reviewing my game. If possible I would like some help on choosing the biggest move on the board at certain times. Anything, like variations,  you would like to add would be very appreciated.  Thanks Again
  Anthony

Chris: Hi Anthony,
First looking through your game it feels like you need to re-evaluate how you are looking at the board. Many moves feel like they are just being aswered for the sake of answering but do not really accompish anything. Maybe you should imagine playing a strong player and asking yourself with every move if it is really worth playing here or if your opponent really needs to answer if you play somewhere. This way, hopefully, you will start utilising your moves more effektively. 
In order for you to become stronger, I would recommend 3 things:
1.) Solve tsumego suitable to your level. Suitable to your level means you can solve one problem between 5 and 10 minutes. Remember this is a reading exercise and not "I know the answer beforehand".
2.) Play many concentrated games. While fast games are fun to play, they wont help you a lot in your progress. 
3.) Play through Pro Games. Personally I enjoy this a lot, and often it gives me new effective shapes, ideas about how and what to attack, and it is also the way I learn joseki and tesuji. I (a german 1d now), memorise 2 or 3 pro games a week.

;W[nc];B[qk];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq]C[Chris: It is really worth studying this simple joseki. It will teach you shape and give you more maneuverability. Many weaker players believe connecting is the only choice here, but let me show you a few variations, I hope you will memorise and use in your games. Memorisation comes before understanding.]

(;W[fp]C[Chris: Lets also quickly look at what happens if Black tenukis now.]

(;B[cn];W[jq];B[ed]LB[nc:A][cn:B][nq:C]C[Chris: Now (latest) we have to find the biggest side. Consider that the White stone at A is low as well as the black stone at B. This makes both groups very solid, but with little development potential. What does that mean? It means, it is not urgent for either side to try to get a position there. You cant get a lot of terretory, nor can anything be killed. We have to choose a joseki now, that takes this into account. Also consider that the kakari at C is the biggest move on the board now; but completing a joseki in the top left is more urgent.]

(;W[df]C[Chris: With this joseki, you give Black a chance to settle easily, and attempt to build a position on the right which is not too favourable for either side. Kakari Bottom Right!]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[bb];B[hc];W[ci];B[cg]C[Chris: Overplay, but as I mentioned the top right and bottom left corners are very solid, so fighting will be ok.]

(;W[dg]C[Chris: Helping Black, see variation.];B[ch];W[dh];B[bi]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[dm]C[Chris: I guess you can be satisfied with the influence you got, but now you have to attack/invade to use it.]
;B[ce];W[cf]
(;B[bd];W[bf];B[bh];W[be];B[dd];W[bl];B[ad];W[of]LB[qh:A]C[Chris: Ajikeshi!! It takes away the option to invade at A! Play this if you have potential on the top side, which you dont have here.]
;B[pf]
(;W[kc]C[You make a 2 pt extension to get a base for ur groups. Black is solid, as he captured the corner, so no chance to attack. Your corner is alive and solid also, so there is no meaning in this move.]
;B[mq]LB[rp:A][qp:B][qq:C]
(;W[pn]LB[qk:11]C[Chris: This move is weird. Because B11 is low, and already impairing your base, consider moves which directly build your central moyo, or consider the invasion points I showed.]
;B[qo];W[mo]C[Chris: Good idea.];B[dn];W[en];B[eo]

(;W[ko]C[Chris: If the 2 White stones had been there already youd answered the peep right? So why play in a way that gives this peep away for free?]

;W[nl];B[no];W[nj];B[ok];W[oj];B[lk];W[mj];B[kk];W[jn]C[Chris: Solid.]
;B[ih]
(;W[ki]C[Chris: Try to grasp the idea of the leaning attack. Force your opponent to secure terretory, that is uninvadable anyway, to gain a position to attack something else from. Also remember, when you have that much thickness, you should attack large groups of stones, not just 2.]
