RE[W+55.50]

C[Okay, I'm Fwumptapuz (27 Kyu) and I'm playing black against Joojoonas's 
white (25 Kyu). I made a lot of REALLY horrible mistakes in this game, as 
you'll see, and I woudl really like some advice and what I should have done 
to defend against it. I woudl also like general comments on my strategy and 
how I can sharpen it. Thank you for your time and consideration.


newsman (12k): Hi Fwumptapuz. I've had a chance to review the game. I wish I 
could say the tendency to make mistakes goes away at some point, but being 
human, you know.    :)

Anyway, there are five or six main concepts I hope to convey that should 
help your game.

enjoy.];B[op]MA[cc][dd][dc][cd][ce][de][ed][ec]LB[qp:A][qo:1]
[qq:2]C[This is my 
standard opening move. I always tend to play to the inside side of a hoshi 
in the corner. It seems most defensive to me. Is this a good tactic?


newsman: An opening move at any of the Xs are time-tested and considered 
strong. The only difference is strategy. Starting at the 4-5 point like you 
did, generally emphasizes the bottom side, since it allows white to easily 
invade at 1 or 2.

If white plays 1, you play 2, claiming part of the corner and side. If white 
instead jumps to the corner with 2, you play 1, building outside influence 
you can later use to build territory.

Once moves are made in other corners, if you get a chance to play a second 
stone at A before white invades, you will have a strong claim on the corner 
and side.];W[dd]LB[cc:B][fc:A]C[My opponent tends to like to play directly on the 
hoshi. What makes this tactic strong?


newsman: playing on the hoshi is very strong because of its flexibility. It 
can be used to claim the corner, the side or for outside influence, 
depending on circumstances and strategy.

two basic points are A and B. See variations]
(;B[oj]C[Here I go trying to claim the right side without letting him 
seperate my groups.


newsman: In the beginning of the game, stones are usually played first in 
the corners, then the side, and finally the centre. That is because  corner 
territory is easiest to claim, and the centre is the hardest. At this point 
two corners are still wide open, so stones in either of those should be 
considered first.

Remember, your two stones still don't claim the side, since there is a lot 
of room between them and the side for white to invade and live, though they 
are beginning to establish influence.];W[dp]
(;B[dj]C[I was attempting to seperate his pieces and destroy the opportunity 
for connectivity.


newsman: keeping white separated is a great strategy, just make sure you 
don't end up becoming weak in the process.

see variation];W[pd];B[jd]C[Once again trying to divide and conquer.]
;W[gq];B[fo]MA[nc][fc][cf][cn]LB[jd:A][dj:B]C[Here I was approching to maybe try 
and bait him so I could figure out his motive in this corner, but I believe 
this move to be a bad decision after looing at it now. What do you think?


newsman: I agree it's not a great move. It doesn't really threaten the white 
stones, and doesn't build on the strength of your own. It really just sits 
in the middle of nowhere.

At this point in the game, the best moves are those which build up the 
strength and influence of your own stones while taking away strength from 
your opponent.

For example, the A and B stones are looking a little lonely and vulnerable, 
so approach moves at any of the Xs would help make those stones stronger, 
start to build territory for black and take away potential territory from 
white.];W[mq]C[newsman: white is following the principle I just mentioned, building 
from his stones towards yours.]
(;B[jq]MA[qf][nc][fc][cf][cn]C[Another seperation, but this one doesn't seem 
so good either, in retrospect.


newsman: The placement of this invasion is fine, it's just a little 
premature. There are other areas on the board with more points up for grabs. 
Again, any of the previous Xs would still be strong moves. Or attacking the 
white stone from the other direction works as well. see variation]
;W[jr]C[Here is first contact made by white in what seems to be an attempt 
to divide my sides and directly assault my stone at K-13.

newsman: your invasion is forcing white to respond by getting stronger. When 
attacking, try to remember that it usually makes your opponent strong as 
well.];B[ir]C[Putting pressure on white and trying to force it down away from the 
rest of his group.];W[kr];B[kq]C[This up coming sequence of moves I believe to be one of my first big 
mistakes.


newsman: as mentioned before, my biggest concern is with the timing, but the 
sequence itself could have worked out better, as you will see.]
;W[lr];B[lp]MA[iq]C[newsman: connecting at X instead would ensure he is divided.]
;W[iq];B[ip]C[I believe I should have played H-2 to defend instead of trying to 
attack...


newsman: no, the stone at J2 is dead now. The move at J4 actually works well 
to use the dead stone to your advantage by using it to build up strength on 
the outside.];W[hq]C[This gave him the opportunity to connect and seal off my group.]
;B[nq];W[hr];B[mp]TR[oj]C[Realizing the stone at J-2 is lost, I'm attempting to form a 
barrier in order to hopefully force the entire white group into the floor.


newsman:  This is a smart move. White has gained a little bit of territory 
against the side, but in exchange you have a nice wall that works well with 
the stone at P10, and with the corner, to form a potentially huge territory.

Unlike chess, where the idea is to eliminate an opponent, go is a game of 
balance. You won't eliminate all of your opponent's territory, nor should 
you try. But an exchange like this, letting your opponent live small while 
building up larger territories, is a fabulous strategy.];W[jo]
;B[mr]SQ[jo]TR[ip][fo]MA[qf][nc][fc][cf][cn]LB[qp:A][lm:B][io:C]
[ho:D]C[Not 
really sure why I did that...


newsman: It happens. For the last 15 moves there has been a large battle 
going on along the bottom side. That is now over, but sometimes it is hard 
to detach yourself from that battle and look again at the whole board.

Sometimes after a protracted struggle like this it's best to take your hand 
off the mouse, grab another cup of tea or coffee, (or beer) and take a look 
at the whole board for the next best move.

We both agree N2 isn't a great move. What is better? Those Xs are still 
there, calling out for attention. A move to point A consolidates the corner, 
while a black stone around B threatens the lonely white stone at K5 and 
begins to firm up a large territory around P7. Extending to C or D also puts 
pressure on the lonely white stone and starts to connect the two triangled 
black stones, building on your strength while weakening your opponent. Moves 
that serve two purposes are generally stronger. Also, if you cut off the 
stone on K5, where will it run?];W[lq];B[js]C[Once again another dumb move. I knew that he would take J-2 in 
response, but I was hoping he woudl forget to fill it up before I could take 
the rest of his group.];W[is];B[ms]C[Another blind move on my part...


newsman: yes, as noted previous, time to move on to another part of the 
board.];W[nr]C[...allowing him to get me once again.

newsman: actually, no. see variation]
(;B[ns];W[or];B[pr];W[os];B[hs];W[gs];B[kl]C[Trying to divert his attention upward as well as to reinforce my

(;B[kn]MA[jp][jo][io][ho][go]LB[fn:A]C[newsman: attacking the marked white 
stones is a good idea - attacking weak stones frequently works to your 
advantage, but try coming from the other side with A, to cut it off from the 
other white stones. Your stones towards L6 are already strong and don't need 
further reinforcement at this point

see variation];W[jn];B[jm];W[im];B[km];W[jl];B[gn];W[fn]MA[fo]
[fp][gp][hp][ip]C[newsman: Now it is your group, marked with the 
Xs, that has been cut off and should be dead. However, we both know what 
happened.   ;)];B[hm]C[Obviously I'm attempting to eradicate the white group around J-5.]

(;W[ik]TR[mr][ms][ns]MA[qf][nc][fc][cf][cn]LB[gm:1][hm:A][oq:B]
C[newsman:  a 
move by white at 1 instead ensures your black stones are dead and the white 
group connects to the side.

Rather than play A, which only works because of white's mistake, it's time 
once again to concede some territory to white and take a look around the 
board for a larger move.

You can flee to Point 1 yourself and keep the white groups separated, and 
your black stones alive, or any of those Xs still vacant.

A stone at B forces white to take your triangled stones, but shuts off the 
corner from invasion. Now that wall is really producing dividends! (and it 
prevents the invasion that devastated you later)];B[hl];W[il]
;B[ko]SQ[fo][fp][gp][hp][ip]TR[hl][hm][gn]MA[in]C[He took a long pause right 
here obviously knowing that his group is as good as gone.


newsman: of course, he could have survived by connecting at X, which was a 
big mistake. If he connected, your triangled stones would have become very 
weak and he quickly could have turned the tables on you by attacking them. 
This, combines with the nearly dead square stones, give white a great 
advantage, until his big mistake.];W[hn]C[I'm not really sure why he made this move, because his plays seemed 
pretty strong up to this point. Seems kind of like a waste of a turn.]
;B[in]SQ[fo][fp][gp][hp][ip]TR[ik][il][im][jl]C[Mmmm...my first meal of the 
game.


newsman:  and a huge turning point. Your square stones have risen from the 
dead and his triangled stones are in BIG trouble.];W[oq];B[jj]
C[Another really stupid move by me. I didn't even realize O-4 was in 
danger. I think I got too arrgant and believed that white group at P-2 to be 
dead to rights and instead decided to close in on the J-8 group..


newsman: yes, though at this point all is still not lost, as you'll see]
;W[np]TR[op][pr]MA[no][pq]C[Ouch.


newsman: at this point, that nice wall and corner territory is on the brink 
of crumbling. Both of your triangled stones are very weak.

White has two good entry points into your territory, both marked X. You 
can't protect both, and will lose some territory. The goal is now to limit 
the damage.

The variations are too numerous to go through, but here are a couple other 
ideas.]
(;B[oo];W[no]
(;B[hj]C[Securing the kill at J-8.];W[dl]MA[pq]C[newsman:  even now, a a black stone at Q3 would have sealed up 
the corner and prevented most of the damage.
At his point, white has already broken into your territory. You can't chase 
him out because his stones are connected to the side and are alive. You must 
give him part of your territory. If you try to kill him outright it will 
backfire, as happened later.];B[nn];W[on];B[mo];W[nq];B[pn]

situation. The triangled black stones and triangled whilte stones have both 
been cut off and are being pushed up against live opposing groups. There is 
a good chance one will die.];W[mm]C[newsman: white sees this and starts to give his group more 
liberties. He now has five, compared to four for you.];B[qq]

Yeah, that's pretty much it. His reaction perfectly sums up the moment. It's 
like, what the hell, you know?



newsman: Yeah, it hurts to overlook something like that. It happens, though. 
Remember however, that you can stop these kinds of disasters with one or two 
preventative moves earlier on to secure the corner.

Learning what is secure is an ongoing process. Though I spot weaknesses in 
your position, stronger players find the weaknesses in mine. There's  a 
lesson in each game, if you learn it.];B[ij]TR[sk][sj][rj][qj]
[qk][ql]MA[pj]C[So, feeling slightly agitated at 
myself, I decided to secure J-8 a little more.

good point to take a break and survey the whole board, since there are no 
life and death battles going on. You have a live group in the centre, but 
not much else. White has the bottom right corner and has influence in the 
others. However, the game is not yet lost.
Any of the X moves would build up your territory on the side, while putting 
pressure on white's corners. As well, white's corners can still be invaded 
from behind.

Here is our altered end-game. It didn't really matter, but I wanted to know 
simply so I can understand the rules better and see if I was missing 
something. Anyway, thank you for reviewing my game.

~Fwumptapuz


newsman: the white stones at J16 and G9 are also dead, but, like you said, 
at this point it doesn't matter.

Hopefully my comments throughout the game were helpful. To sum up, here's 
some ideas.

- always remember to look at the whole board. Go is a complex game and this 
isn't always easy, but when a life and death struggle has finished in one 
part of the board, take a break and look around. Usually the next biggest 
move is somewhere else.

- try to work on your opening sequences, especially joseki. There are many 
resources that can answer your questions about playing on hoshi points or 
4-5 points, etc.
I've found the Elementary Go Series by James Davies to be a fantastic series 
of books. The ideas there are useful for players up to single kyu.
The best free resource I've found is Sensei's Library on the internet.
You can find it at http://senseis.xmp.net
You can spend many hours there (if not days).

- in the beginning, generally try to extend from your own stones to expand 
your power and take away your opponent's power. We saw examples of this in 
the game.

- you understand the concepts of connecting and dividing, though a couple 
times you missed a chance to either connect or divide. Keeping your stones 
connected, and dividing your opponent's, is a central concept in the game. 
Don't overlook this powerful weapon.

- efficency. I'm still working on this concept myself, but in general try 
not to waste stones. A useless stone is like giving your opponent a free 
move, while a stone that serves two or three purposes saves you a move or 
two down the line.

- try to learn some techniques for invading your opponent's territory, 
either along the side or in the corner. If your opponent's territory is 
large, but still very wide open, it calls out for an invasion. There are 
some basic sequences you can learn, that you can find in the above 
resources.

Anyway, I hope this review helps. It's been fun for me to do.

If you have any questions about my review, don't hesitate to contact me,

Thanks,
newsman]))
