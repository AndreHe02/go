;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe]LB[qg:a]C[r15 is the usual play here for Black, instead of q15.

At this point, White cannot afford to tenuki (move elsewhere).

White must protect the cut at 'a' or else Black can wreak havoc.]
;W[qn];B[mp];W[pk];B[gq];W[cf]C[Instead of c14, better moves might be:
1) c6, to avoid Black getting a double wing formation, or:
2) k17, to keep Black from getting a huge moyo on the top];B[ce]
C[Black at c15 not usual, as Black doesn't have a stone around c10 to cramp White.  Black should either pincer White, or extend to f16 or f17.]
;W[df];B[fd];W[cn]C[White should play at c10 or d10 instead, forming an ideal extension from the 2 White stones.

It's always tough in a high handicap game to know how much to extend.]
;B[cj]C[Good move by Black, recognizing White's mistake.

Black has effectively separated White into 2 weak groups.];W[ci]

;B[ep];W[ej]C[Good move by White, flattening Black and gainning access to the center.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[dl];W[eq]LB[ei:a]C[the cut at 'a' is dangerous for White.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[bq];B[fq];W[el];B[ak];W[bi];B[jd]C[Big point by Black.    At this point, White has done almost nothing to catch up in terms of territory.  And Black is looking pretty solid too.  White will need to do some seriously successfull invading to win this game.]
;W[ke]C[Bad move by White.  Helps Black seal off the top (which is looking very big), while doing nothing for Black.

As Black, I'd consider o17 or even q18 at this point on the top.  On the bottom, I'd play L3 as Black, and latter (if still available) r3.]
;B[kd];W[le];B[ld];W[ne];B[of]C[I'd preffer to seal the top, with 017.  Territorially it's very big, and there are still plenty of way to invade White's prospective central moyo.]
;W[nc]C[White's invasion happens too late, when Black  is already too solid in the area.]

;B[lg]C[n13 is of no importance in this battle.     Don't hesitate to sacrifice unimportant stones.

C[Good move by Black. White could not afford to be locked in.     I get the sense here that both players are trying to save all their stones.

In a large running battle like this, it is important to constantly evaluate weaknesses (one's own and opponent's), and judge what can be sacrificed.

By playing k14, Black not only kills n17 group, but as a consequence brings stability to his p18 group too.]

;W[hk];B[jk]C[Saving L9 group is not the priority...];W[kl]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[oe]C[p15 is bad for Black... in a battle for liberties, don't fill in a common liberty until the end.

L18 is the more important move (although White is way behind in the battle for liberties)]
;W[na]C[019 accomplishes nothing.];B[mb];W[mn]C[Strategically a good move by White, although White is too far behind now, and this move is not big enough.

And besides, White has too many weak groups. It's hard to pick fights when one has many weak groups on the board.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[oi];W[oj];B[gk];W[im];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[hf]
;B[ge]C[g14 is better];W[gf];B[ff];W[fg];B[fh];W[eg];B[he];W[ee]
;B[ed]C[A break for White.  Black should have played at f15, of course.]
;W[fe];B[eh];W[dh];B[de];W[ef];B[bf];W[bg];B[af];W[cc];B[ag]
C[unimportant.];W[ah]C[White should never have defended here... White should play at b16, threatening to cut the 3 Black stones.  When Black defends, then White can make life for this c14 group, with the advantage of already having another stone in the corner.]

;W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[js]C[Important to read ladders carefully before playing.

Overall, White played too aggressively, leaving too many weak groups all over the board. And Black punished him for that.

When playing high handi games, White must have patience, knowing that he will be behind for a good part of the game.  High handi games are catching-up games, in which White tries to leave situations unsettled for as long as possible to explore their aji. But White cannot afford to leave many weak groups all over the place.]

(;W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[ki]LB[hd:a][lj:b]C[Next, White is either looking at 'a' or 'b'.     'a' puts some serious pressure on the 3 Black stones on the top, while 'b' gains lots of central influence, and has Black running.  With Black running, White can make good territory on the right and center.

Most of the time, one attack to gain territory or influence, not to kill.]
