C[Hi, in this game I lost by 5.5 points (with the Komi) But I thought that I could jave won by a good amount so can you help me to point out my major mistakes? I would like also some help in Good and Bad shape as I am not so familiar with this concept.

By the way, I played Black on this game.



 Thanks,

Hi there Adalberto. I hope my comments and variations are helpful to you.
Please see variation 2 for 9 examples of good shape before the game starts.

well, this move is perhaps nearer than most people would play, but it is ok....]

Yes, this response is fine];W[kq];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[dh];B[dc]
C[I think I should have only takne the 3-3!

---
yes, i agree with you, just taking the 3-3 point is better]
;W[ec];B[cc];W[eb];B[ef];W[id];B[jc]C[I think this move only helped White!

---
yes, i agree with you again, white cannot cut the m17 stone off very well, so there is no need to try and protect it at the moment with k17, especially as k17 makes white's weak group more solid.]
;W[ic];B[fp];W[dn]C[see comment on next move, then variation 2]

(;B[eq]C[Thinking later about this move I tought that I ended up helping white, what do you think about this move? 

---
Well, the normal move here might be d3 which would lead to a much better position for black (see variation on previous move). E3 is very small, and yes, it does seem to end up helping white...]
;W[dq];B[iq];W[ip]C[How should Have I responded to this attachement? 

---
You responded in the right way at h3..];B[hq];W[jq];B[ho];W[io]
;B[hn];W[dk]C[Is white's 40 ok or is it a mistake? 

---
This move is ok for white. If black gets to play a move around here first, the white d12 stone will be in trouble....]

(;B[nr]C[Thinking later about this move I decided that it is too small for this stage of the game, what do you think?

---
I think this move is ok, although not the  best move. It does have the advantage that it attacks whilst making territory.]
;W[mq]C[And he responded in the same way...

---
yes, this is a reasonable white move...

the next black move is too slow, see variations for better black moves]

(;B[in]C[Is this move ok?

---
no, this move is too slow, see variations on previous move...]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[kn];B[mi]C[Should I have played here or on Q7?

---
again, i would say that o6 is probably still the best move

if you play a move like this one, it is often best to make a moyo with right angles, so instead of n11, play n9 because it makes a 'box' shape for the moyo in the upper right...]
;W[qm]C[Question: I am very unsecure in responding invasions like this one, can you give me some help about the theory behind answering this invasion? 

---
With invasions like this, a proverb which springs to mind is "don't touch what you are attacking". See variations for better black moves than r6. Basically the thing to remember with situations like this is that you  have the power here because you have more stones in this area, so remain calm and play a solid move.]

(;B[qn];W[pm];B[qk];W[pn];B[qo];W[nn]C[I think I have dealt pretty well after all!

---
you have sente it is true...];B[bh]C[Is this move a mistake? Should I have tried to defend the moyo by plying somewhere around O9?

---
this move is ok i think.];W[oj]C[Thinking after the game I found that I should have just plyed O12 straight away instead of pushing the stone around. Do you agree?

---
I agree that p9 was not the best move, see variation for something better. Q12 is the right idea here, but i think you can actually play at q11 (see variations)]

(;B[ok];W[nj];B[mk]C[However, this move is the right idea..good]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[mj];B[lj];W[ml];B[lk];W[ol]C[There you are, It didn't work!

---
 it didn't work, but you can still get an alright result if you play q11 now...]

(;B[ph]C[Should have played here intead of P9 in first place, right?

---
no, you were correct to try to cut the white stone off first to take its liberties away - and then you can shut it out of your moyo with q11]
;W[ni]C[If you are going to try and make the most territory with your moyo, the next black move should  be o12]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[og];W[ng];B[ne]C[this black move feels very slow to me. It does link your stones up but - again it only has one purpose..]
;W[mg];B[ki]C[this is nice shape];W[kg];B[bk]C[He destroyed part of my territory, so I had to destryo his....

---
yes, ok, good thinking..];W[cm];B[an]C[this black move is an overplay (see variation). Luckily white did not see it and just answered quietly]

(;W[bo];B[cj];W[dj];B[hk]C[This move is ok? Or should have played somewhere else?

this move is ok, although i would have been tempted to play m8 first..]

;B[oc];W[ob];B[rc];W[rb];B[ke]C[this is not necessary, white cannot cut the black stone at m17 off]
;W[jf]C[---not a good white move];B[db];W[of]C[How should I have dealt with white's 112 and 114? They destroyed my side territory almost completly...

---
you really should have kept more territory - in situations like this just remain calm and play solid moves]
;B[pf];W[qg]C[the most solid calm move here is to simply connect at q13. Often, when your opponent threatens like this (with an overplay), the best answer is "only connect".]

Perhaps the most reliable shape in a real game is the ikken-tobi (one space jump) in the bottom right. Always trust the ikken-tobi.]
