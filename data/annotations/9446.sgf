C[Hi, my name is Valentin and here I played a game against a good friend of mine, Thomas. I was really proud of sacrifising my group on the left side. But is this the right way to play here? This game was all about fighting, so maybe a higher level player can tell us some better moves in the fights. Can you review for both players, please? Thank you very much!

Hello, 

I am not incredibly stronger, I will nonetheless do my best in the review. GTL needs more volunteers to do reviews, in general, then odds to get the "much stronger" reviewer will increase again. Feel invited to join and bug the local dan players to do so as well.

I would have preferred to do the review in German. 

Have fun!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[nq];B[pn];W[nc];B[qf]

(;B[kq];W[no];B[oq];W[mq];B[kp];W[lo]C[tapir: Somehow, I do not like this result for Black, despite Black starting with 3:1 stones in the area, White is now pretty strong, while Black has still a lot of weaknesses on the right side / corner.]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[jn];W[ml];B[cm];W[co];B[cj]C[tapir: This move triggers the exchange W36-B37 that White probably wanted to play for quite a while.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[df];B[fb];W[ea]C[tapir: I do not understand Black here. This exchange does not gain anything for Black, so Black can wait with it, if there is no plan to follow up with a reduction of White's framework. As the game went Black would have much preferred a simple endgame at E19.]

(;W[en]C[tapir: White spent a lot of moves here without a clear benefit. The pressing moves D8, D9 are not doing much work in particular, no weak black stones nearby and no white stones for building a framework either.]

;B[nf];W[mf];B[me];W[od];B[pc]LB[of:A][qj:B]C[tapir: Even if White does somehow escape from P14 or tries to use the ladder threat around R10 to break into the right side, Black will have no trouble to handle his M15 stones.]
;W[pe];B[of];W[oe];B[qe]C[tapir: The whole sequence probably means White hallucinated he can push through at Q14 before realising the shortage of liberties. Always read first, even after an initial mistake you can at least salvage something by sacrificing.]

tapir: I honestly do not know. The long variation you pinned on this move contains moves, that don't look at all like obvious or only moves.]

[gl:10][fm:9][dn:2][do:3][eo:4]C[We both agreed that this move is important for White! Is it true?

tapir: 

You wrote at the start about sacrificing your group on the left. It does not look like that at all. You ignored it once to play in the center and then lost the group, you did not sacrifice it. That is why you made 13 more moves locally, of which quite a few subsequently died and the rest helped secure something like 6 points of territory (White gets as much by capturing 2-4). You can't really tell me you played 1-12 tactically to sacrifice.

Important for what purpose? If it is about cutting off White in the center, then maybe this was important already earlier + there are other moves locally.
