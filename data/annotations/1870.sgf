LB[qc:B][id:C][ne:A]C[white's next move at j16 (C) caught me out - how does one keep the spirit of the san-ren-sei going here? normally we might get either of the two variations branching off here?]

(;W[id]C[I'm sorry, I really can't comment too much about normal variations.  The one point jump and the play at the 3-3 point for white would be normal.  But following out the variations too far is not the way I think of it.  What do you want to accomplish here?  That is what you need to keep in mind.  Are you looking to attack W?  Or build a large framework?  If you want to attack, then attaching seems wrong because it makes W strong - and makes the  w stone on j16 an attack (in conjunction with the steel post) on B L16.    So you get a running fight and no large framework - but you almost get the corner.  If you want a running battle - which can be in the spirit of the san-ren-sai - then attach.  I happen to like B p15 or o15 here.  Both play well to build a large framework, support the B pincer stone, and put pressure on W o17 without making it stronger.
Also playable is q17 - takes the corner and uses the L16 stone as a threat on the white stone.]
;B[oc];W[md]LB[pf:A]C[couldn't think of an adequate response to this - can I just play quietly at q14(A) and exchange positional development?

White should play the steel post here - but W n16 is playable.

Once again, what does B want here?  Playing q14 seems right, and consistent with p17.  The B stoen on L16 then becomes a thorn in w's side - a source of constant concern and burden.  I would not try to  do much with it until I can see a good attack on the n16 w group or some other value from it.

A curious move, but one which works at this level is B p18 - taking the corner and almost saving the B stone underneath.  This move makes sense of P17, at least.  But it is a bit small, really.

If you don't mind losing the corner and like complex, multi-group fights, I like B L14 here or the counter-counter-pincer at G16 or the attach at h16.  Those moves are all going to lead to complex fights so should be undertaken only if you are confident in your fighting ability, or want to learn what happens when you try them.

Tenuki is also possible here - in which case I like K4 - which actually has a rather substantial effect on the whole board.  But again, you then give up the corner, or if w chooses, you live in the corner and are blocked in.

So once again, the next move determines what course the game will take.]

(;B[kc]C[this has a yucky feel to it.

Yep.  B is very heavy now, and outnumbered 3-2.  When you are outnumbered, play light, or play attaching moves such as K16, J17, or the shoulder hit of K15 - which makes for a very, very complex, multi-group battle involving the two white groups on either side of the running B group.]
;W[mf]C[A simple move by W here - go proverb - the one-point jump is never wrong.

Now B wants to play Q14 - but having spent two stones on the pincer will be reluctant to do so.  But should anyway.  The two stones can fend for themselves since the B Q14 makes the w group none too steady.  So if B q14, W L14, then B has an assortment of pincers, attachments or simply running at K15 to use.  But B would be better off leaving the area after solidifying the right and wait for the right opportunity to escape or to attack.  Escaping  after W L14 would be too costly on the left top right now.]
;B[kf]C[This will immediately lead to W playing to settle its group and leaving B cut to ribbons with drifting groups and a small, gote corner.

(OK, I was partially wrong - B chose the outside rather than the 10 points in the corner.    Wrong choice.)]
;W[pf];B[oe]C[Ouch.  Attach or  just take the corner.  You leave terrible aji now. W should simply play p 14 and fight the mult--group running battle that results.

You do not want to make the w n16 group stronger until you settle either the corner b group or the b L group.  Try never to have more than one weak group on the board at a time.  now, just 15 moves in, you have two burdens.]
;W[lg]C[A favor for B.];B[of]C[I would have taken the corner with p18 here.]
;W[qc]C[W shows B no respect here.  This is small if B responds properly.  B does not want to have two burdensome groups to W's one group.


So the idea is to cut w to ribbons - three or four groups while settling your groups if at all possible.  Be single-minded about it.]
;B[ob]C[Ok - shows fighting spirit and almost connects underneath.  But a simple move at q13 plays for strenghth and influence more in keeping with the san ren sai opening, or a simple block at r16 - inelegant, but it does the job.  But if you are able to back it up, P18 is a good, aggressive move here, at least locally - and can connect your two groups to great effect - but if you play this, give up on getting anything of value in this corner.  Try to get out with sente and play elsewhere.]
;W[qd]C[Now connect under, right?  You gave up the corner already with the stones played in suppor of your L group - so this is just as expected and planned.  Or else you don't put the stones in the L group.

If you do not play n17, then play q13 to make sense of it all - and to try to get away with sente]
;B[qe]C[ouch.];W[pe];B[pg]C[If this was what you were going to do, why play r15?  Just play this stone immediately.]
;W[qf];B[re];W[rf];B[qg];W[rd];B[rg];W[se]C[Take your sente and go elsewhere or still connect up at n18 or attack the w group at k12.]
;B[ng]C[your comment:  this looks sensible for black - has sealed white in, kept his groups separate, strengthened his moyo and not really had any delitirious effect on the weak black stones top centre. is this a reasonable a) result and b) assessment?

my comment:   If it were sente or putting pressure on the w outside group, it would be fine.  But it is gote, does not save the b group, and does not do anything to the w group and gives up 10 points in the corner.

In the right-side context, the result is good for B, except B played there first and had 2 stones to 1 plus the q10 stone which is now abysmally close to the 5 stone wall - the stone should be 6-7 lines away - around q6.  So this is too good for w.  Hence the idea of not sacrificing here - just playing Q13 immediately - and not wasting the aji and not building a not-very-helpful wall.

A very simple w play now - M11 - dramatically reduces the value of the wall, reinforces the w group, and puts more pressure on the b group.]
;W[oh]C[what's the best answer - simple connection? - whatever white does next, he would be unlikely to then play a stone at p12, so it might end up looking silly?

my comment:   Go proverb - fools and professionals ignore a peep.    If you ignore this, and play p12, then w starts running along the 5th line.  But this is not so good for w's group either.    Nonetheless, I would connect here and then attack if w plays o12.  I think this is a poor move by W.]
;B[nh];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj]C[As I said - so now you need to come back an defend, your wall is useless and eyeless.  But W has created a second heavy group  and will have two groups to look after.  THis is overall better for B, but B gets a better result by connecting in the first instance.]
;B[og];W[pk]C[this looks a lot better for white than I should have allowed

my comment

Once you ran white out, it was a one-way street.  You should have connected - and thus avoided helping w.]
;B[jh]C[Tough call - but neither B group is really strong nor in trouble.  I would push on the right side again - making the w group even heavier and you stronger and then clobber the heck out of the 4 white stones.  Look to sacrifice a stone or two at the top while cutting off the tail.  Or just connect under.  Connecting under settles things for b while leaving w insecure.  A good thing for B.]
;W[li]C[And this is why.];B[mj];W[kg];B[jg];W[je];B[ke];W[ki]
C[do I really need to play k14 next - trying to separate at n15 doesn't work without p16 as far as I can read it, but is p16 a possible answer here?

My comment:

Complex choices now.  N18 is simple and not bad.  If W cuts, you can still counter-attack.  Attacking at G16 is interesting.  Connecting is simple, but seems heavy, but makes the attack on the two stones that much more severe.

You want to settle both groups or they will continue to be a bothersome burden to you which w can exploit at will.]

(;B[jf];W[nb]C[r10 looks good now. So does J10 - inducing w to make moves to induce you to run to the bottom.]
;B[ra]C[better left as a source of ko threats / endgame plays for later?

meaningless at this point];W[qb];B[qa];W[rb];B[od]C[?? What does this do?  Getting the cut isn't really what this game turns on now, is it?]
;W[qj]C[Wouldn't you rather have had a black stone at 54?  That was the key point in the whole formation for both sides.]

(;B[ij]C[big error - should have been at n15 - then white's in serious trouble?

my comment.

N15 does connect  you up and makes sense of your connection at p 16.  But it has little effect on W - who abandons the tail and saves the body - or abandons the whole group - notice how many stones B would have invested for a very small territory -if W can build something on the top and left by using the group.

Bu running out after abandoning the tail is probably best for w here.

But this is playable, especially since you still have n15 in your back pocket.  W cannot take time to connect up because b L9 kills things - so the timing is right here - if you follow W l9 with the cut.]
;W[kk];B[ml]C[and another chance goes begging - I seemed to get a blind spot after p16, which is pointless if I don't play n15, and linking up my groups removes my troubles, no?

My comment.

Yes.  p16 was pointless if you don't connect your groups.

But it is still a running attack and not so bad for B - with the Lgroup being strong now and the w right side group not being fully settled yet.]
;W[nf]C[all gone now!

W should just play n 14 here, though.];B[lf]C[misreading here - thought there might still be possibilities]
;W[mg]
(;B[me];W[ne];B[nd];W[le];B[mk];W[km];B[ed]C[hmm - in view of what now happened, where should I really have been playing?

my comment:

are your b groups settled?  Or do they need  more?

Hard to say.  TIming is rough here.    I prefer F16 here so that W cannot play g 16 and make goodshape so easily.]
;W[gd];B[cc]C[Oops.  Where is your attack?  F16 is very good here.

This or the next move would be the losing moves.];W[dd]C[f16 is still good]
;B[dc]C[ouch.  Game over, unless w makes a huge error.];W[ee]
C[no.  you must now either connect or play b16 to take the corner.]
;B[fd];W[fe]
(;B[ge]C[massive overplay given weak wall and shortage of liberties, no?

my comment:

The wall is not weak.  But the top group is.    This is not an overplay, if you want to create really game-deciding fight.  But if that was not your aim, then it is.

Better woudl be g17 and live to fight another day.];W[gc];B[fb]
C[Just connect and fight on.];W[gb];B[fc];W[fa];B[eb];W[he]
C[white duly punishes me];B[gf]C[best left alone for aji? though I think it might have been playable if I'd cut at d15 at the correct time.

My comment

You must pull this stone out - now the top group is weak and the left top w group is becoming weak.

But be prepared to sacrifice these stones.];W[hf];B[gg];W[hg]
C[cut at d 15 or hane at h12 or best - extend one more time  I like the cut, here.]

(;B[ii]C[this is where I think I should have cut at d15

my comment:

yes. or just extend again.];W[gh];B[fg]C[Again, the cut is correc here.]
;W[dg]C[now it doesn't work! not worth reviewing beyond here really, is it?

my comment.

Well, W has no territory to speak of, and there are lots of chances for errors yet - but losing the 4 stones and having two weak b group without any weak w groups does make the game pretty much over.]
