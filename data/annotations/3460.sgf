LB[mg:A]C[not really sure what I'm trying to achieve around here

-A captures the black group

I also looked at the end of the game and I saw that you have a very winnable position up until near the very end.  However, I suggest that you first concentrate on improving your opening and mid-game tactics.  I noticed that you often placed your stones into atari, which is never a good thing.

Remember, reading is everything :)

Good luck!]
