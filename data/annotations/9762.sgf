C[Hi. Thanks for reviewing the game.  I am looking for advice on the many serious mistakes I made ending in me losing by a huge amount!

Hello, I'm Julien, 2k. I add variations and comments in your game. Hope this helps.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[pe];W[jd];B[op]TR[oq]C[is this a good opening?

Nothing wrong until here, even if I would prefer P4 at P3 because of the white stone on the left.]
;W[qj];B[cj]TR[cf][ci]C[More standard at C11, but still ok. Also, approaching the top right corner at C14 is a good choice.]
;W[cl];B[qh]TR[cf]C[It is pretty rare to tenuki in this position. I would have answer at C14 for instance. If you would like to approach R10, no need to play C10 first.]

;B[cn]TR[cq][dq][kq]C[questionable?  F5 better?

The most important question is: what do you want to do? I cannot catch your plan. If you want to attack C8, don't play F3 first. If you want to establish on the lower side, do not pincer.

I would have play either L3, D3 or C3.];W[eo];B[cq]C[this is what I was going for but did it work well?]

I think it is almost even but I prefer white

Black has 50 + influence in the top right.
White has 41 + komi + influence in the bottom + sente.

Any white play in the bottom (like Q3) will be big and sente because black will instantaneous becomes weak.]

C[I tried to save this stone without luck... please advise on the best course of ruining whites moyo.

Why do you want to save this stone? It has already played a role and will be still useful in yose. Do not ask too much to a lonely stone ;-).

Also it is too late to ruin all the white moyo. You can't (ok, maybe Lee Sedol can) and you should'nt (even Lee Sedol should'nt): 
- if you die, you loss the game
- if you live, you are not sure at all of winning the game because black will get something in exchange.

Now: white has 50 + komi + a huge influence in the bottom + center while black has 62 + potential weakness in the bottom right. Ok white is ahead and that is a pretty difficult and important move to play but it is still playable for black.

In order to invade, you can trace a line between your sphere of influence and the white one. It is not so easy here but it is roughly the triangle line. Any move which crosses the line is an invasion the further you cross the line the riskier the invasion is.

Also, in order to invade deep, you have to look at ennemy weaknesses (cutting points, etc): that is not the case with your move.

Since your moyo is far smaller than white ones, you cannot just follow the line but you have to play carefully.]

End game advice?  If I had kept the top right corner and managed to save the F3 stone I would have won I think?
Thanks for your time!

Difficult to give end game advice since the game was lost in the middle game. I don't think that you will have won the game if you saved the F3 stone and kept the top right corner: you would certainly have some other important losses in exchange.

In this game, you invade far too deeply and so you lost the game. Also you must take care of your own weakness (and of the ennemy ones).

Hope this helps,
Julien])
