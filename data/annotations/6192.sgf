C[Biondy [7k\]: hi
Decky [8k\]: hi


Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy 7k player in KGS, and this is 
one of my game in KGS.

I made terrible mistake in the beginning (lost the corner fight), 
and I tried to got as many points as I can, but didn't manage 
to. however I'm still happy with this game.

I hope you can help me especially in the middle game and endgame.

thanks in advance];B[pd]C[Imagist: My perception of this game is that you did well overall with the exception of the mistake you mentioned.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[cf];W[fc];B[di];W[bd]TR[qf][qj][jq]C[Imagist: This is certainly large, but a bit slow here.  One of the triangled points would be bigger.]
;B[cl]TR[jq]C[I think black is overconcentrated here.

Imagist: I agree. I would recommend the marked point for black.]
;W[qf];B[qi];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[pf]C[strange.

can I use this move to make my advantage?

Imagist: Yes, I think you did use this to your advantage very well.]
;W[od];B[qg];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[Imagist: Black is terribly overconcentrated, while white's shape is efficient.]
;W[md]LB[kc:A][jq:B]C[Imagist: This leaves the top side relatively open.  A move around A would be better, but then white can be pressed low, so I would avoid the top side entirely.  B seems like the largest point to me.]
;B[jd];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[lc];W[mc];B[jf];W[qn]LB[jq:A]TR[dp]
C[I always confuse with direction. should I keima at O3?

Imagist: I don't really like the keima in either direction here.  Since black's marked stone is developable here, the focus should be on the bottom side.  I would play A.]
;B[mq];W[oq]LB[qk:A][fq:D][hq:C][kq:B]C[Imagist: This is solid, but I would worry about giving black a double wing formation.  White has the extension to A if black jumps into the corner, so I would favor a pincer at B here, aiming to extend at C.  The approach at D might also be playable.]
;B[jq];W[fp]LB[dq:A]C[Imagist: This is a light move, but here it doesn't seem really appropriate.  White wants to establish a stronghold on the bottom left.  I think I would attach at A directly.]
;B[gq];W[cp]LB[fq:A]C[well, I made it terrible here, where should I go here (instead 
this move)

Imagist: I think white is okay simply descending to A.];B[dq]
;W[cq];B[fq];W[do];B[bo]C[Imagist: Black doesn't seem to have much feel for shape.]

;B[ie];W[ee];B[df];W[be];B[bf];W[fh]C[Imagist: Black didn't respond to your overplay correctly, but you still have to spend this move to make up for it.]

Do you think this move is too slow? if yes, where should I play 
then?

Imagist: Yes, I think this is too slow.

Let's count the score:
Black has 50 points and good potential around A and B.
White has 51 points, but not very much potential.  However, white has thickness around C.  So white must use that thickness to prevent black from realizing his potential territory.

Thickness is for attacking.  So white should look for weak groups and try to drive them toward his thickness while reducing black's potential.  The black group on the top is weak, so white should attack it.  I would start with D (see variation).]
;B[hd]C[Imagist: Black has the right area of the board, but this shape is again no good.]
;W[hc];B[gd];W[gc];B[gf];W[fe];B[ge];W[gg]C[Imagist: Too slow.  White is running out of chances to make territory or reduce black's.]

Biondy [7k\]: i meesed up my beginning

That's it. I lose. anyway I wonder why It didn't count dead there. 
anyway I still lose.

I hope you can help me at what I asked. Don't hesitate to tell 
me more.

Thanks once again.])
