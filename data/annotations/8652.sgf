C[Hello, I'm Sergio playing as white, Jabawaka [6k\] on KGS. I feel i didn't do a good fuseki and midgame, I tried to come back in the yose and ended up winning because of black's mistakes at the end.

I have to say this now, I am very slow (and pretty bad) counting and calculating the points and therefore I can't tell very well if I'm behind or not, which can lead me to playing very agresive when not necessary or too defensive when I'm behind.

Thanks for reviewing the game.

\\m/ : Hi Sergio, funny games you give to review, I wouldn't have bet anything on white until the end of chuban. This is a good example to illustrate some basic rules of go : "Don't use thickness to make territory" and "Push from your weak group to your strong one". It's really what happenend at south in this game, you overestimate the south territory and push from this strong position to your weak group on the east side, for consequence, this group was walking on the deathline the whole game. But for a happy ending, black missed the cut he threatened in the early fuseki so you could catch up.

Of course, all that is said here is only my opinion and I may say a lot of shit but it's part of the GTL. For your question about counting, I have no other technique than counting point by point, when possible, multiplication helps.

Keep on rockin'

C[I pincered here to avoid black extending from the komoku in Q3. Maybe another pincer further away, like J3 or K3 would be better, I don't know. But I didn't feel like extending.

\\m/ : This pincer is ok, on a small personal database, I found 5 pro games in this position.]
(;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]
(;W[po]C[Joseki says to go E8, don't know why I missed that.

\\m/ : you mean e7 but this is ok too, until now everything looks totally normal.]
;B[qm]LB[ro:B][qq:A]C[\\m/ : I would answer at B, A looks also ok if you're not confident with the joseki variation at B.]
(;W[oq]C[Ok, here's my first big question. I want to build territory using my wall, which is why I played P3. I checked Kogo's joseki dictionary later and it says it's inferior, so I don't know where to play in order to favor the exterior influence. Kogo recomends P4 if I'm not mistaken.

On top of that, I messed up a lot during the "joseki".

\\m/ : the thing here is not that how to accomplish what you want but to understand that what you want violates one of the well-known principle of go.

DON'T USE THICKNESS TO MAKE TERRITORY.

Thickness shall be used to attack the opponent, to push his stones against it.

I don't see p4 in Kogo.];B[or]C[Kogo says it's a mistake, but I messed up even more.

\\m/ : well, if you have already checked Kogo you should know now how to handle this.]
;W[pp]C[\\m/ : but if you don't know joseki variation, try to remember a classic sequence : "tsuke - hane - extend". It's not all the time the best thing to do but it ends rarely bad.]
;B[nq];W[qq];B[op]C[\\m/ : aaaargggg, giving a ponnuki should always be a pain. Sometimes it is necessary and good, (don't think this is the case here) but even in these times, you should suffer doing that to avoid giving unnecessary ponnuki.]
(;W[lq]C[I played here instead of R2 or something like that because I felt the corner was safe, but it's obviously not...]
;B[qr]C[\\m/ : of course, b has already an easy game.];W[rq]
;B[ro]C[\\m/ : vital point, b is punishing w well.];W[pm]C[I'm just trying to get out or surrounding R8 if blocked.]
;B[ql];W[nn];B[pj]C[\\m/ : b is very happy, still the cut remains.]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[qc]C[I jumped in the corner because I thought that running out will get me up against Q10.

\\m/ : both are playable, you can also try the counterpincer at r14 (my choice)]
(;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[nd]TR[qf]
[pj]C[\\m/ : now r14 is right in the place where q10 wants to develop, that's why I'd block the other side.]
(;W[fp]TR[lq]C[I feel this is a bit slow, but I'm not really sure. I was scared of bad aji and as I have said before I wanted to favour this area. Maybe playing an extension around H17 would be nice.

\\m/ : yes, more of that, m3 was not a good move but it has the merit to help e3 group, if you had f4 now, what is the use of m3 ? Only making territory ? This is not a good spirit for playing go.]
;B[fc]C[Black gets to make the extension I didn't do, pretty obvious.

\\m/ : of course, sorry if it sounds harsh but untill here, b can't play bad, he just have to play the obvious move you rejected.]
;W[df]C[Would this stone be better on the 3rd line? I usually play here because i want to keep the attack on the kakari stone, but I don't know if it's the right way to do it.

\\m/ : yes, with c6 in place there's no big development for a 4th line stone on this side.]
;B[ch]TR[kd][cn][cp]C[\\m/ : b has support on both sides so he can play this way.]
(;W[db]TR[ch]C[Defending the corner, and threatening an invasion on the upper side of the board.

\\m/ : but coner is still open at the other side.];B[fe]C[\\m/ : I'm really intrigued by the following to discover how w can win this game.]
;W[cj]C[I considered C13, but felt I would get very cramped and black could make a nice deal of points in that area. I felt the corner stones are pretty much alive and strong enough to support the pincer.

\\m/ : If you wanted a stone at c13, you could have played it directly instead of the tobi d14. You can chose one or antoher but these two rarely fit together.]
;B[eh];W[cg]TR[ff]C[Trying to connect, if black blocks at B12 I can jump towards the D5 area.

\\m/ : go out first.];B[gh]C[\\m/ : I like this move even if I'd have kept w separated with c11]
(;W[kh]TR[pe][gh][pj]C[This is where I started going crazy and being lost. To be fair, I don't count (still don't know a fast way of doing it) and therefore I can't calculate very well if I'm behind or not. I didn't want black to seal a large moyo on the upper area, and after a while thinking about it I played here hoping to connect to either the upper right corner, the low area or living inside.

\\m/ : Looks too deep, your q5 group is still floatting and you have a single stone at c10. Adding another weak stone in b sphere of incluence may be risky.]
;B[qh];W[rg]C[I guarantee life (or so I think) for the corner stones and strengthen to get to L12.]
(;B[rh];W[pf]
(;B[nf]C[I just don't know why black didn't hane, I can't see any problem with that.

\\m/ : hane is possible.];W[og];B[ng]C[But I get locked in anyway.]
;W[kj]C[I didn't see until this point that I wouldn't connect to the corner, so I rush to get down.]
(;B[ek];W[bh]C[Linking the stones I think.

\\m/ : agree, see previous comment ^^]
(;B[mo]C[That is the move I feared. What I thought now is that I could secure the H3 area while trying to connect, and if cut I'd link with the O6 stones and live together inside black.

\\m/ : as said earlier, I would have fix this group status instead of l12. But the roots of evil here is r2]
(;W[ko]C[So i defend.

\\m/ : No, this is not defending, it's just making some 5 points, here is the super solid side, the weak group is the other.

Push from the weak side to the strong one.];B[mn];W[nm]
(;B[kn]
(;W[jo];B[ll]TR[kn][jo]C[\\m/ : ah, ouch is now. The exchange is good for w]
;W[ok];B[pk]
(;W[nk]C[This at N9?

\\m/ : problem is much earlier.];B[mi];W[lk]C[Here I connect, and hope to live inside. But I think it was due to black softness, because there's little space.]
;B[jl];W[kf];B[je];W[dh]C[Big mistake, I kind of forget about my mid stones now, which aren't alive at all. But black doesn't punish me bad enough I think.

\\m/ You kind of forget about your weak positions untill you played l12.]
(;B[ig];W[ii];B[gj];W[ik];B[in];W[io]C[\\m/ : 2 points gote play ?]
;B[hn];W[ho]C[\\m/ : and even smaller...];B[gn]
(;W[ga]C[\\m/ : ah ok, this is yose time with such a central position...]
;B[gb];W[fa];B[ha];W[ea];B[hb];W[em]TR[cm]C[Again, I don't even know where I am going with this move. G8, although forming two nice keimas, doesn't grant me connection given black's strength.

\\m/ : The usual purpose of this move is the follow-up at c7 to develop the side... that's why b often answer in joseki variation. Here, the side is already w so it's just a gote move on dame.]
