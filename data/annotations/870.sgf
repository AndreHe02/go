GC[Commentary by Steve Fawthrop 99/08/15]

;B[pp]C[The first move of a game is usually played in  the top right hand corner.  Given that it is not clear in an online game whether the point of view is that of black or white it can be claimed that the first move should be in the top right or the lower left corners.  But to play in the lower right is NOT considered standards and many white players would consider it insulting.  It is best to always play in the upper left corner.  That way noone can take offense.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pc]LB[pe:a][qe:b][qd:c][pd:d]C[This is a questionble move although not outright bad.  The reason is that it gives B a nice move at 'a'.  See the comments on the next move.  In this shape I almost always play at 'b' but 'c' and 'd' are also common.]

(;B[jp]LB[pe:a]C['a' would be considered normal.  The reason is that it works well with the move B1.  See the variation shown for a simple sequence which might result.]
;W[pe];B[dj];W[jc];B[df]LB[cf:a]C[This move would be better played at 'a'.  As the following moves show, W can secure the corner very easily after this move and so B is a little dissatisfied.   If B plays at 'a' then either W has to defend in gote or B gets to slide into the corner later and this would be very big.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[ce];B[bg];W[fd]C[W is happy with this shape and B feels over concentrated.  That is: the 3 B stones could be one line further away from B7 and W could still not invade so B is not getting as many points as he could have done from the 4 stones.]
;B[qn]LB[pm:a][jj:b][pj:c]C[This is definitely slow, but not downright bad so it is definitely playable.  However, I would prefer to play one of the marked points all of course give B more territorial prospects.]
;W[qj]LB[qi:a][ql:b]C[W should probably hold back to 'a' because if B invades between 5 and 16 then W can only extend to 'b' which is too narrow.  On the other hand, if W holds back to 'a' then if B invades W can extend to 'b', which is better for him and alos B does not have as much room to live.]
;B[dq]LB[dn:a][fp:b][jj:c]C[Definitely too conservative.  In the corner both 'a' and 'b' are better.  These would leave the corner open but if W invades then B will get a lot of territory on the outside and so W will not gain my invading.  All in all though, I recommend playing at 'c'.]
;W[nq]LB[ki:a]C[Definitely a bad invasion. B is very strong in the lower half of the board and W will be at a big disadvantage.  W is not yet behind in territory so he should be in no rush to invade.  'a' would have been a nice move.]
;B[oq];W[lq]LB[np:a]C[W does well to avoid the standard move of 'a' whcih would make him heavy.]
;B[kq]LB[jq:a]C[B can consider palying 'a' instead of this move but this is still a good move.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[mr];B[oo];W[lo]LB[np:a][ns:b][kr:c]
C[W should connect at 'a' and he would be very hard to kill because he can later play at 'b', 'c' or 28 to make eye shape.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[kp]C[W is almost alive so this empty trianlge is nothing more than an inefficient shape.]
;W[lp]LB[kr:a][no:b]C['a' and 'b' are both better shape.];B[dm]
C[This is undoubtedly a big move but it seems a bit contradictory.  Why paly the bad shape move of B31 is you are not going to continue the attack?]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ls]LB[js:a]C[If W want to make an eye here he can do it in sente by playing at 'a']
;B[os];W[nr];B[kn]LB[jm:a]C[Now that W is alive this is a little too close.  Later W may be able to cut through and capture this stone.  I prefer a move at 'a'.  B39 is in the right direction however.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[fq]LB[ni:a]C[W cannot expect ot live in here.  He has successfully live once inside B's territory.  Trying to do so again is pushing his luck.  W should be happy with his success so far and just extend his own territory. 'a' looks good.  After all, if B stops W from laying at F3 then he has to take a move to do it and so W will get 2 moves elsewhere.]
;B[fp];W[ip]LB[gp:a]C[Too heavy.  W probably cannot live in this confined area but his best chance is something like 'a' to start forming eye shape.]
;B[io];W[ir]LB[js:a]C[This is dangerous because a B move at 'a' threates thew group to the right.]
;B[js];W[jo]LB[ho:a]C[Better to just play at 'a' and _threaten_ to paly at 48.  W still has to defend and so W has not throw a stone away.]
;B[ko];W[ho];B[in];W[hn];B[gp];W[hp];B[hm];W[gq];B[er];W[fo]
;B[gn]LB[ep:a][gm:b]C[This is the move which let's W live.  It achieves nothing.  First of all it forces W to play atari on B, which in turn forces B to connect.  Second, it leaves too many cutting points.  W is threaten to capture 2 stones and so B must defend but he should do it with 'a' and not give W anything he does not deserve.  The best W can do after that is to paly at 'b' .but that does not give him any eyes]
;W[go];B[ep];W[im];B[jn];W[gm];B[hl];W[fn]LB[fm:a]C[Generally speaking it is better to play at 'a' instead of taking the stone off the board.  The reason is that later B might be able to get a stone at 'a' himself and take the eye away.]
;B[jl];W[el]LB[fm:a][em:b][dl:c]C[This unneccesary.  It forces B to defend the left and so solidify himself there, but it desn't stop B from getting a stone at 'a' later. 'b', which anticipates a response at 'c' is better shape.]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[ej];W[dn];B[ks]LB[cn:a]C[This can wait. Block at 'a' is essential to maintain the left side.]
;W[lr];B[ns];W[no]LB[nn:a][mm:b]C[This does not guarantee eyes.  B does not need to connect.  If B responds are 'a' then W is in trouble.  W should play at 'b' abd escape.]
;B[op]LB[nn:a]C[Unnecessary. 'a' makes it very difficult for W to live.]
;W[nn];B[ln];W[nm]LB[on:a][pn:b][nl:c]C[Too slow.  If B exchanges 'a' for 'b' first then he can jump to 'c'.]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[cn];W[do];B[co];W[dk];B[ck];W[em];B[fk]LB[ol:a]
C[Pointless.  W is alive. This just creates a cutting point.  Better to return to the right side and play at 'a' to continue the attack.]
;W[cj];B[bj]LB[bl:a]C[B must protect the double cutting point by playing 'a'.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bk];B[bl]LB[ci:a]C[Wrong side.  The corner is alive so this is small.  Atari at 'a' required to make shape.]
;W[ck]LB[ci:a]C[Too slow.  'a' affects B's shape more.];B[bm]
C[Very small. This is an endgame move.];W[bi]C[Another small move.  W is alive so capturing one stone is yose.]
;B[ci]LB[fj:a]C['a' is the key point here.  If B gets to connect he has no weaknesses in the middle.  This just creates extra cutting points without much gain.]
;W[aj]LB[fj:a]C[Why?  Nothing was in atari.  W is alive.  B could be in trouble if W cuts at 'a'.]
;B[di]LB[dh:a]C[Not only is this small, it is also the wrong shape. If B must connect here then 'a' is correct shape.]
;W[gl];B[gk];W[hk];B[il];W[hj]LB[fj:a]C[Looks nice for W but B really has enough space in which to live.  Cutting at 'a' gives W more profit.]
;B[fj]LB[gi:a]C['a' is correct shape.];W[hh];B[fh];W[hf];B[ff]
LB[bh:a][ch:b][gi:c][fi:d][gg:e][fg:f][ee:g][ef:h]C[This is not a guaranteed live shape for B.  Imagine W forcing by palying 'a' thru 'h' and B has a bulky 5.  B109 should have been at 'e' to give him more eye space.]
;W[ge];B[nc]C[Much too deep.  Either this stone should die or W will get a lot of outside gains.  Either way B will lose out by invading.]
;W[lc]LB[md:a]C['a' would be harsher on B];B[ne];W[le];B[ng]
;W[nb]LB[pg:a]C[Wrong direction. A move at 'a' would pretty much secure a large side.  This move really does not achieve anything except connect W. But then W does not need to connect.  He is alive on both sides if he plays at 'a'.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[pg];W[od];B[nd]LB[pk:a][oj:b]C[This looks important, but it is wrong.  It saves maybe 10 points but the 2 stones are not needed for live.  Moreover, W has to play another move in gote to capture them.  Playing at 'a' threatens both W16 and the group below.  If B is not confident of his ability to play a move like this then 'b' is still better, threatening W and stretching his out group.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[og];B[oh];W[pf];B[pi]LB[ni:a]C[Letting W cut is very dangerous.  B does better to connect at 'a' and if W tries to capture B121 then he can haapily give it up and cut off W16.]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi];W[nj];B[pj];W[qg];B[ph];W[qi];B[pk]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[lk]LB[mg:a]C[W should cut at 'a'.  The B stones above have almost no chance of escape.]
;B[lg];W[kj];B[li];W[kl];B[jk]C[B must live first before thinking of attacking W.  This move does not help his eye shape above.]
;W[kk];B[ji];W[ki];B[kh];W[jj];B[ii];W[ik];B[jm];W[hi];B[jh]
LB[jg:a]C[Too heavy. 'a' is better.];W[ij]C[All this does is connect W stones.  It threatens nothing.  Admittedly W does not have two eyes below, but neither does B have two eyes above.  If W continues the attack his prospects are better.]
;B[ml];W[nl];B[mm];W[mk];B[ok];W[nk];B[qk]LB[ig:a][hg:b][lf:c]
C[B does not have two eyes above. He must live first. Ba, Wb, Bc is the correct sequence.]
;W[qh];B[je];W[mf];B[lf];W[me];B[mg]LB[ke:a]C['a' is correct shape and still prevents the cut.]
;W[ke];B[kf];W[jd];B[jg];W[ie];B[gg];W[hg];B[bf];W[be];B[bh]
;W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[es];W[eq];B[hs];W[gr];B[cr];W[is];B[eo]
;W[en];B[on];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj];B[sl];W[om];B[pm];W[ms];B[ps]
;W[mc];B[oe];W[pd];B[ee];W[ed];B[de];W[fe];B[gf];W[gh];B[gi]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[gj];B[fi];W[fl];B[ae];W[bd]C[W must block. He loses 4 points here with no compensation.]
;B[ad];W[bc];B[ac];W[ab];B[af];W[cb];B[ah];W[ai];B[al];W[ak]
;B[jf];W[ol];B[pl];W[sk];B[if];W[md];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt])
(;B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[qd];B[pf];W[nc];B[pj]LB[jp:a]C[This is a common joseki which might be expected to follow if B plays at 5 instead of 'a'.  B's formation on the right is idea, whcih makes B5 a very good move.]
