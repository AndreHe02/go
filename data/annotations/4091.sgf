;B[pp]C[Hello,

I'm 2d playing white against another 2d. I got crushed in this game and cannot find any big mistakes. Please take a look at this game and reveal my problems.

thx in advance,
Bommel




Hi,

I will try my best to point out the most major mistakes you made
in this game. Hope it helps.];W[dc];B[pd];W[dq];B[de];W[ce]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[cl]C[Q: Is this too close? Or would a move around R10 be even better?



This is a good move. It aims at the invasion at D12.  R10 is also OK, but that is another game.]
;B[pj];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[mo];W[lp]C[Q: Is M4 too slow?


I think this move is not bad. I feel white gained in territory in this exchange. Usually, B[N5\] is considered too early.]
;B[nc]LB[ch:A][dh:B][bh:C]C[Q: Up to here I'm satisfied with the result, the game seems even to me. I thought about D5 now, but then B can enclose his corner with S15 and an invasion seems hard afterwards. That's why I took S15 myself. But the result of this invasion wasn't satisfying at all.



If I were you, I play  W[a\], B[b\], W[C\], by taking away the territory
of this black group and attack it, you can expect to enclose the moyo on bottom side. It is more active than play D5. You can still afford to wait a while before invading into B moyo, and the best way to invade is by attacking the group on the left side.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]LB[pe:A][qf:B][od:C]
[rf:D][rb:E][qg:F][pf:G][og:H][of:I][nf:J][pg:K][ph:L][oe:M]
[oh:N]C[This is almost the losing move. should do the following .

W[a\] , B[b\], W[Q17\]. after that from B[C\] to W[N\]. That is a very common way to invade and you can effectively damage black moyo.]
;B[pe]C[Good move];W[oc];B[nd];W[rb];B[rf];W[sc];B[se];W[qa]
C[Q: This seems to be the only possibility after B cutted with R15. But living in the corner in gote isn't exactly what I was looking forward to. Where should I invade instead, to avoid a similar result? S15 was a flop.

Maybe a simple reduction is enough. But with a 4th-line stone like Q10 in place I cannot think of an good reduction move.


Exactly, up to now, Black lead very much, The moyo becomes real territory. and White only get 5 points at the corner. All these are due to the fault of W[Q17\]. If play as I suggested, Black can not lead  so quickly.]
;B[co]C[Now, black got sento and invade into W moyo, that is a huge difference compared to W invade into B at C12 first.]
;W[do];B[cp];W[dp];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bm];W[cm];B[bl]
;W[cn];B[bn]C[I was happy with this result! Building a pretty wall and connecting the lonely C8 stone was more than I expected.



Actually, you have nothing to be happy here, consider that B took away your coner, and at the same time you lost the invasion at C12. I think Black should be the one who is happy.]
;W[km]C[Q: This move seems logical to me, because it shifts the line of 2 moyos. Is there anything bigger on the board?


This is a natural move.];B[gm]LB[ck:A][bk:B][dj:C][di:D][ci:E]
[bj:F][ej:G][ei:H][fj:I]C[White might consider W[a\] to W[I\] to impose pressure on the invading black stones, try to attak it and suppress the explosion of black moyo.]
;W[go]C[This move has no pressure to B and is slow];B[ck];W[pr]
LB[qq:A]C[W should play W[a\] to take to cornoer, which is bigger.]
;B[qq];W[pm];B[qm]C[Q: With the support of L7 an reduction at Q7 seems appropriate. is this a good idea or should I reduce somewhere else?


I think this invasion is OK.];W[ql];B[pl];W[om];B[qk];W[qn]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[ql];W[po];B[on];W[oo];B[nn]C[W should connect at W[b\], and this is no way for back to eat white here.]

(;W[qp]LB[op:A][np:B][no:C]C[Q: I think ko is the only possibility now. Connection at R5 doesn't work, as far as I can read. I added an possible variation after the game to confirm my thoughts. Is there a tesuji I am missing? Or is playing ko the right choice?


This Ko is the second major mistake, you should R5 connect. Black can not eat W, if B[a\], W[b\], B[C\], you can play at R4, B[Q3\], W[S3\].
Black died.];B[rp];W[ro];B[qo];W[bq];B[bp];W[qp];B[mp];W[mq]
;B[qo];W[ap];B[aq];W[qp];B[ob];W[op]C[Q: My corner group was a pain in the ass all the time, so I threw it away. White could go on, the ko is not over yet, but he missed this opportunity. Nevertheless I ended in gote. Was this choice ok or should I answer P18.


After this ko, you lost the game. You should have gained here with on cost. also W[P4\] should simply W[r5\] to finish the ko with one move. In the way you played, you used two moves to finish the ko and wasted one move.]
;B[pb];W[pq];B[el]C[Black again took sento and expland his moyo. So far, Black has big potential in the center, while W has no potential. even in terms of territory now, B is leading, let alone that it has more potential. 



For the rest of the game, both Black and White are gaining more territory, but It is clear that W can not win and I just stop here.


I think in all the  battles in the three corners, Black gained. The biggest mistakes White made to lose the game are W[Q17\], W[R4\], and W[P4\]. Those mistakes are not small mistakes. Hope White can avoid simialr mistakes in the future.]
;W[jc];B[je];W[hd];B[hf];W[mm];B[nm];W[lj];B[jj];W[fe];B[ge]
;W[gd];B[ff];W[he];B[gf];W[il];B[hk]C[Q: Suddenly 20 points of B territory started blooming in the center. Maybe I realized this too late and missed the chance to take appropriate counter measures.]
