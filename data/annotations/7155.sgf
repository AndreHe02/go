C[Hi ! Thanks for whoever will review this game.

I've added some of my thoughts during the game as well as a few questions.


* Hello, my name is Litost, I play as 1k on KGS and I'll be your reviewer on this game. I will start all my comments with a star (*).

* Your questions were mainly about direction of play, so I have oriented the review on strategy (although there were some tactical sequences that I have pointed out, for your pleasure).

* In this game, I felt that you played while under the impression of being late in the score. As a result, your moves were concentrated on reducing the opponent territory, without really devising a plan or an attack to gain more profit than your opponent. This reducing approach lacked ambition, and gave a better situation to your opponent, who won the game without really trying.

* I would like to suggest that you plan more your attacks, and do not feel forced to invade at all costs: balance of territory is indeed important, but is not the only thing to consider: balance of power, shapes of groups are as much important. For your next games, try and take your time, to slowly choke your opponent  :)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cq]C[* I am not used to playing san-san (3-3) opening, but I feel that there is a slight issue here: hoshi (4-4) opening is definitely influence-oriented, and san-san is territory-oriented. As a result, it will be hard to make the two stones work together efficiently, so I would recommend playing at least one komoku (3-4), either with the hoshi or the san-san.]
;W[dd];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp]C[* This move is of course valid, but lacks a bit of spirit: both groups end being settled, and the corner is shared. When possible, I think it is better to delay the enemy group's settlement; who knows, later some good attacking opportunity may emerge?]
;W[qq];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf]LB[qh:A]C[Does reacting in this way overcontrate black's forces on the right ?

* It does a bit, but is not a problem to me. Pincers are also playable, and lead to different games.

* Black has a now a weakness around  R12, so white will look for it. A weakness can often be seen as an opportunity, though. Black may try and reinforce indirectly, or even induce an invasion to obtain a splitting attack elsewhere.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[ld]
(;B[gd]LB[cf:A]C[I felt a bit overcontrated anyway, so I tried splitting white up.

* I do not like this move, actually, for many reasons: (1) it does not threaten white's group (its base is not that bad, and it's open to the center), (2) it does not make territory, nor take the corner, (3) white's top is not so closed that an immediate measure is needed (even one additional white stone at the top would not prevent the area from being successfully invaded).

* I would therefore concentrate on empty areas, and try to assert ownership upon them. What about the simple C14? If white retreats with F17, then you may start and build a position on the left (for instance around C9, or even on fourth line). If white pincers, then you have many options, among which the counter pincer looks interesting. Two variations proposed.]
;W[df]C[* An interesting move. Now white can aim at E17 to sabotage black's base, while enclosing the corner. Playing E17 at once would permit a counter-pincer by black, and G16 would end up being treated lightly (good for black).]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[jd]C[I felt white was pretty kind, letting me settle a bit.

* I think this is fine for white. He indeed is playing calmy against your formation, but you may treat your own stones lightly : why bother attacking them if you can discard them at will?

* Also, white helps his own group at the top, and he can now aim at E17 or E18, which are big (enclosing the corner, threatening your base).

* By the way... how come you are happy to settle that fast in the opening of the game, while not even being under attack? :)]
;W[dp];B[cp]C[I wondered for a few moments in which direction to extend for this joseki.

* Either way, white will have a large influence. I think the other way might be better though, as white stones at the bottom right are already pretty flat.]
;W[do];B[er];W[gp];B[fp];W[fo];B[fq];W[go];B[hq];W[co];B[ci]
LB[gd:B][ci:A]TR[eg][fh][gi][hj][ik]C[Major thickess for white towards this side ! I needed to compensate for it. I chose this point because I had some room to extend and it threatened to slide under white's enclosure.

* I understand your feeling, and the reasoning behind is sound, but I think this is getting dangerous for you. I am the attack-type player, and this is the kind of situations I just love. Let me explain why :)

* You have two weak groups : A and B. And there are white stones stepping in-between. Immediately, I want to engineer a splitting attack, i.e. develop thickness between your groups, push one group outside while building the thickness, and slowly pressure the other one while doing so (closing the escape routes). At the very least, you will lose the initiative for most of the game (and of course, I intend to win much more than the initiative!).

* In the end, I cannot help but notice that this is the second time you felt you had to "reduce" your opponent territory. In itself this is may reflect an agressive spirit ("I want to win, yay!") or a timid one ("I'm late already, let's hurry and try to close the gap!"). In either case : take more time to prepare your attacks. A well-prepared attack will always yield a  benefit (a kill, more influence to attack even more, or simply territory).

* Also, in your own experience : have you more often killed an invasion, or let it live/escape? What is the most difficult ?]
;W[ck]C[* Though one might think that pushing the stone towards the thickness at the bottom is best, this pincer is already very severe.]
;B[bf]C[* Good reaction, but you're not alive yet.]
(;W[cg]LB[bh:A]C[* This is interesting, but maybe too calm. White presses (reinforces black), and takes influence, which can be used to attack the top.

* However, black's top group looked stronger, so maybe it was better to plan the attack the other way around (attack the top group first, "leaning" on it, build thickness, and attack the left group).

* Also, B12 instead of C13 looks much more violent :)];B[bg]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[di];B[cj];W[dj];B[mf]C[* Playing B9 first is a must (it threatens the C8 atari, so is sente).]

(;W[oj]C[* This move is too loose, it induces black Q11 (protecting the weakness), and achieves little. Reducing at P10, or invading at R10 or R11 looks more agressive.

* Also, a move at B9 looks quite interesting. Two variations proposed.]
;B[pi];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[kp]C[* The direction of play is very good here. You successfully offset white's influence.]
;W[qm];B[rm]LB[qj:B][rn:A]C[* White has increased the aji in the area. You have to beware moves like A or B (not working as far as I can read, but still dangerous).]
;W[kr];B[jq];W[lq]C[* A bit slow.];B[fc]C[* A bit slow, too. G14 looks better to stabilize your group (and reduce white's influence, while keeping the san-san invasion at hand).]
;W[bk];B[aj];W[bd];B[bj];W[be];B[af];W[ak];B[ah]C[Black makes small life on the side, giving white lots of thickness... was it worth it ?

* Definitely not, white gains too much.];W[gf]C[* Very big point.]
;B[jf];W[pn]C[* This move destroys all the aji, and reinforces black. It fits white calm style, though.]
;B[qo];W[eb];B[ec];W[dc];B[fb];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb]
(;B[jk]LB[mb:D][dk:B][pk:C][po:A]C[I chose this point because it looked like a middle point between the upper and lower black stones.

* I see, but as a result this move lacks a bit of direction. When faced with such situations, examine your opponent's weaknesses (cutting points and invasion points), and try to devise a plan based on these weaknesses.

* If we analyze the situation here, we find 3 cutting points (A, B, C) and one invasion thing (D). Let us review some variations on this (but before doing so, try and look at them by yourself, and find out which one you like).]
;W[oi]C[* A big point indeed.];B[ph];W[pj];B[qj];W[km];B[ki]
C[I thought of K11 first, it seemed too easy on white.

* Why not M5? White's territory would be greatly reduced. Your central stone is unlikely to get captured.]
;W[lp]C[* Big point.];B[ko];W[lo];B[in]C[* This move is a bit strange. The peep E6, followed by H9, look simple and efficient.]
;W[gl]C[Now I realized I should've taken care of the left side instead of L11.]
