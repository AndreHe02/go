C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game! I played black in this game.]
;B[op];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[dj];W[jd];B[pj]C[My thoughts here are to build up a wall on the right and get sente to play on the lower bottom, creating a large moyo.]
;W[qp]C[This fell in with my plan.

BB: Yes, so far so good.]
(;B[po]C[BB: You're offering White a big corner. White can play as in the game to disrupt the top, or q3 to disrupt the bottom (I'd play q3 as White here).

So instead of q5, joseki like r3 would be fine, or I guess r5. I'll add some simple variations (r3 and r5). I'm not suggesting q6, because it's too close to q10.]

(;W[qo]C[I know the joseki starting with black at Q6, but this seemed too close to the Q10 stone. I don't know correct play for when there is a black stone at Q10.]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[qm]C[BB: I think q6 is okay. With q10 on the fourth line, you can't expect territory on this side.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np]C[BB: Good move. But, by starting with q5, not putting enough pressure on White, you've given White a large corner and sente at the same time.]
;W[iq]C[So I didn't get sente, but I did get a wall. The white stone is well placed, so my attack isn't going to be great. But I am hoping to still get benefit from attacking it.

However, the group will be perhaps too strong. Already, I am behind.

BB: No, j3 is not well placed. White is ahead, because the top is good for White, and the bottom right corner is big like I've said, and he's taken sente, but j3 should be somewhere useful like f3. This way, White's making your next move very easy...]
;B[gq]C[BB: The only move.]
(;W[lq]C[BB: Black is so strong on the right, this move is... dangerous. As White here, I'd be tempted to go simply for j5.]
;B[nr]C[BB: No.

White had no way to connect through here.

White's corner is completely safe.

White can now play a simple move like j5 and be settled (for now).

So, are you trying to preotect against White forcing at m2? Because if you are, the only cost of that would be having to play this move! So if that's so painful, why are you doing it for free, in gote?]

(;W[or]C[BB: This is worse than the last move :) It should be at j5 or similar.]
;B[rm]C[Too small? I was thinking it might be sente against the corner, but it seems not.

BB: If you had really thought about it and convinced yourself, you'd ignore White's next move and try to kill the corner.]
;W[ch]C[BB: This isn't sente. If you think you've got an attack against the bottom roght, you should try it now. If you're not convinced you can attack in sente, then s7 was definitely not sente.

This White move should also probably be at j5.]
(;B[cj]C[BB: I like this move. But as you're behind, I'd suggest attacking the White group at the bottom. g5 at least, but perhaps j5...]
;W[cp];B[cq]C[BB: This is good, making some corner territory.]
;W[co];B[bq];W[do];B[ep]
(;W[eo]C[This seems a mistake by white - shouldn't he play around C8?

BB: I guess so. But then Black here is huge.];B[cm]
(;W[fo]C[BB: Seems a bit slow. I'd go for e7, or perhaps g5.]

(;B[gp]C[BB: This seems a bit slow too. It would be a fine move, if you felt you were winning, keeping youre territory safe. But you're not going to win this game without making more, or destroying White's moyo at the top.]
;W[io]C[White needs to help D5 group!

BB: White also needed to help the bottom group - it's just that you've both been ignoring that for the last 14 moves. But that doesn't make it any less true.]
;B[go];W[fm];B[gn];W[el];B[dm];W[fn];B[gj];W[hl]C[BB: White has escaped, so j5 is basically justified.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[im]
(;W[hk]C[BB: Strange. Why not at j9?];B[fk]C[BB: Good forcing move.]

(;W[fl]C[BB: Should probably be at g7.];B[ii];W[jk];B[jm];W[kn]

(;B[lk];W[kj]C[Perhaps I should have kept pressing from top?

BB: What you *had* to do on the last move is make a move that threatens both weak groups. You are strong everywhere, and White has two weak groups, so...

White has protected one of his groups here. You should now attack the other. Try *something*. It's got to be sente at least. And you'll probably get stronger on the outside, to continue the attack on the other group.

But yes, Playing your last move at l11 would have been fine. Because you'd be hurting White's moyo at the same time as attacking.]

(;B[kh]C[BB: Good (though you could be playing k4).];W[li];B[nj]
C[BB: This is a nothing move. There's no territory to be had around o7 yet. And it sure isn't the attacking move (that would be m12). 

Actually, if you want to keep the pressure up and start making territory around o7 (which would still be hard), m10 would be better.]
;W[lh]C[BB: "Your oppontent's good move is your good move."]
;B[kf];W[lg]
(;B[nd]C[Now I am trying to use the center stones to disrupt and get points in white's area.

BB: First, don't think of it as making points. Think of it as destroying White's points.

Second, attack White at the bottom :)

Third, you could actually make some points. Try r14.];W[fi]
C[BB: This is good. White could end up with points around f14.]
;B[fj];W[hj]
(;B[hd]C[BB: This is dangerous. If White cuts at g11, you'll suddenly have two weak groups.]
;W[gi];B[cf];W[dh]C[After this move, my C10 group looks in danger, but White's attack comes too late - but that might be white's mistake. Should I have defended this group earlier?

BB: Yes! You're weak everywhere. The left, c14, l12, h16, o16. This game is out of control.]
;B[cc]C[BB: I bet if White played b11 now, the left side would die.]

(;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]C[I trade the center for the top, which seems reasonable since this used to be white's. However, it ends up not being enough, as I lost the game.

BB: Unless it's sente, it can't be right, because you've got too much else on.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[he];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce]
;B[bf];W[df]C[BB: This is a dafe move. a15 would probably be fine.]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[qf]C[This is a big move, but I am still worried about my left hand group.

BB: Yes, it's a big move. Back when you didn't have weak groups, I'd have said this was good.]
;W[oe];B[bn]C[BB: Good.];W[bp];B[dk]C[I am comfortable now, but this is gote.

BB: It's worth it. You've got great potential in the top right, and you can still atack meaningfully at k4. Or make a little territory in sente with n6.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qc]C[BB: No. You make a move like this not to make territory (because White wouldn't get any here anyway, with two Black stones near). You play this kind of move to leave White baseless. But White has streangth near enough here (m13). So instead, do make points, but at r13.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[oh]C[BB: Okay, so you've got to worry about making use of those four tones in the middle of White's territory.

Or attack at k4 :)]
(;B[id]C[BB: Hmm. You're helping White cut off the middle stones on a large scale. See var.]

;W[jl];B[hp];W[ao];B[pp];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[This game was rather peaceful, and it turned into a territorial battle. I started off poorly with a bad opening strategy. I was able to threaten the left white group which permitted me to gain some center power which allowed me to take the top area without much of a fight. White lost here, but not enough to loose the whole game.

BB: No, you had a good opening strategy. You just didn't do a good enough job of attacking White's invasion at the bottom.

BB: The reason you were able to do so well at the top was partly that White didn't take the opportunity to attack the left side.

Essentially the loss seems to be from the opening, but I also think that the left hand group was in too much danger, and that gote move cost me.

BB: The gote move saving the left was required - don't worry too much about it. Instead, worry about allowing j11, l12, and l14 to be cut off, or never attacking the bottom group. Or even wasting sente with moves like o2 or s7 (though White let you have o2 in sente).

Was it right to let white get the center? It seems like a large loss compared to what he had here.

BB: No, you should have tried to save the stones in the middle, possibly with l16, which would have worked with all of the center stones. You got some compensation at the top, and the game was close, but l16 would have had fighting spirit. In this case, it comes down to whether or not you felt you were winning (which you didn't).

Thank you for your comments.
