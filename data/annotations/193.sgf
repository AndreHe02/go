(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[I played white against igs player "nobody."

I lost big.  I think my biggest strategic errors were at 10 when I
should have played joseki at b4, 22 which probably should have been
h3, and 26 which probably should have been around n16.  What do you
think?

Of course I made embarrassingly many tactical errors.  Apparently my
"feel" for tactics is not too good.  Any particular tendency that is
worse than the others?

Thanks,
Bill

Dear Bill,
My impression is that your opponent was playing greedy, omitting important
moves to get the big points first. It is not a good style and will result
in very poor result if counter-attacked properly. But you made some small
moves in the beginning that let your opponent fix his weakness.
I suggest that you pay more attention to the security of each group (both
yours and your opponent's) and make your plan according to
that.]PB[nobody]BR[12k]PW[wskees]WR[9k]DT[1995-05-18]RE[B+Resign];B[pc]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[dc]C[d17 is not a good move. The
amount of territory B gets by d17 is not big, and after e16, w becomes very
strong.];W[ed];B[dp]C[This is greedy. When he exchanged d17 and e16, B c14
or d14 cannot be omitted.]

b4 and c3 first is better. Or you could play d10, and aim at c3 invasion
later.];B[pe]C[I would exchange c5 and d6
now.];W[ic];B[nq];W[pn];B[no]C[This seems a greedy move again. W k4 looks
good now, because it separates B o3 group.];W[qj];B[qh];W[pl]C[I'd say this is small at this point. B can still invade at r3, so
right side  is not W's secure territory yet. c15 for W still looks very
good, or you could start a fight by invading around k4, as you did
later.];B[cg];W[jp]C[Good. o3 and o5 stones seem baseless.];B[pr];W[qq]

think this is ok. It is quite big in itself and B still needs to settle
down.];B[co];W[dn];B[kc]C[I think it is more urgent to secure o3 group
first, especially because he exchanged q2 and r3. After this exchange, B no
longer has r3 invasion, so he can't get compensation when o3 group is
attacked.]
(;W[qr]C[This is quite small at this point. I would try to attack this B
differently.];B[ke];W[ie];B[ci]C[Good point. It secures B's territory and
aiming to attack c9 group later.];W[qf]C[This is small again, because both
B and W are secure around here, so r14 is territory only.
Let me say that moves that is related to the security of a group is more
important than moves that is related only to territory in the
opening.];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[rh];B[ph];W[ri]C[Invading at r14 resulted in gote, and B became thick here, not a
good result for W.];B[bl];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[bk];W[cl];B[fn]C[B's strategy
is to separate two weak groups. Good strategy, I'd say.];W[hq];B[kr];W[mp]

But since k4 group is very weak, and so is c6 group, W can't expect a good

think.];B[nr];W[ps];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko];B[kq];W[jo];B[lo];W[mo];B[mn]

seems that this move asks for B f8. Wouldn't you play f8 if you were B?
Since f8 weakens W c6 gp significantly, W shouldn't play here. W should try
to settle down this group without affecting c6 group too much, so I would
play around m8.];B[fl];W[ej];B[dj];W[ek];B[ei];W[gj];B[gm];W[ce];B[be];W
