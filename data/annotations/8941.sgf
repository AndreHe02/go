C[Hi,

This was a game where I played black.
It was a close game, which I won in the endgame.

I'd like to get some help with my opening, choice of joseki, direction of play and how to handle my groups on the side.

I thought I played well and got some big points, but still it was a close game. I dont know why?

Thanks! [NM\]


Im Dawid. Im going to review your game. Feel free to ask if you dont understand something.]

C[There are many choices here: 

-A and B are examples from pro games. 

- I would also consider C, but personaly i like most B, becouse its like splitting marked stones and its simple.(That means it cant be bad) ;)]
(;B[qm]LB[pf:C][qj:B][qk:A]TR[qd]C[What choice of joseki would you play? [NM\]

I dont think its the right choice here.

One is reason is that marked stones are already too low, and they cant work well togheter.


Considering only pincers: A  or B should work better becouse then you can aim at  C, and now  A or B are a nice extension from C.]

Its a kind of move played when you want to attack white strongly and already have somes stones around L3 or M3.]
;W[pr];B[rm];W[fq];B[on]C[I thought this was bigger than answering F3. [NM\]

Truly its really big. White should have played P6 in sente.

Next you can aim to put some pressure on white with N3. After that the P15 is point you really want to have.

Good for you that you dont follow the opponetns. Im sure he wasnt expecting P6.]

[oq][qq][pr][qr]C[I was not trying to kill, hope to reduce and build a wall. [NM\]

Its not so important now. Anyway white wouldnt play at N4 to enclose the teritory becouse:
1) Its small at this stage of game.
2) Marked stones have good shape and can make life easily.

Calmly playing at B is okay, but white can get A and is slightly better, becouse of triangled stones not working well.

From the other side white getting A is also not good.

Maybe I would try to get sth like C and if white answers go back to A, but its risky becouse after C almost every player will pincer with B. :P

No, as I said you could have made troublesome situation for white.

;W[nh];B[eq];W[fp];B[cn]LB[cn:A][eq:B][gq:C]C[Is this the right idea in the corner? [NM\]

No, you should calmly play A. B is wrong becouse it strenghens white.

After A you can aim at C to cause troubles for white.];W[cf]
(;B[db]LB[cd:B][ce:A]SQ[dc][ic][cf]C[I thought about playing K17 instead, I dont really know why I played this. A testing move but I did'nt have a good follow up. [NM\]

Yea! D18 is more often played when C14 is at A. The weak point of marked formation is B as you probably know. And you lose your future B posibility.

K17 better, but You its better to try sth like in the variation(see var.)]

No more comments after here by me. [NM\]

I think you won becouse of white mistakes at the bottom and during middle fight.

Most important i think about game:
Care about shape more, split when you can make double attack or make opponents group floating. Never let them settle easily! They will make more mistakes ;p

General principles i like:
Focus not only on the weaknesses of your groups but always look if you can get  sth from attacking opponents group. 

For example get good shape of your weak group by forcing opponent to defend.]
