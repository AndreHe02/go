;B[dp];W[cd]C[luckymedie: hi enjoy

mushroom: hi];B[qc];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn];B[kp];W[cn]C[Here I was very lost not sure where to go.]

(;B[cl]LB[fq:A]C[I chose here because I was afraid of him developing this top side because I have no influence in the bottom right area so I was hoping to make a base on this side.

janr: So early in the game there is no reason to be afraid of something.  The simplest way of playing is probably either the game move or A, which seem both playable to me.]
;W[en]LB[cq:A][fq:B]C[This suprised me was thinking he would take corner or crosscut after here I couldn't find a great move so went for a basic varation with f4 to try a splitting attack on him.

janr: locally, white follows a joseki pattern, so there is no big surprise.  It is true that A and B are more common, but other moves are played too.]
;B[fp]C[
janr: ok];W[bp]LB[dk:A][bp:B][cq:C]C[This confused me even more and I could feel me slipping behind. I think I should have ignored this and taken c11

janr: the white game move is not a standard joseki.  Usually, white just plays A (to get influence facing the center) keeping the corner open.  Playing the B-C exchange deprives white of invading the corner later if needed, and may be considered a mistake.]

(;B[cq]C[janr: ok];W[cj]LB[cn:A][bp:B][cq:C]C[janr: white is overly aggressive.
black will run out, and the weak white group A (which is heavy due to the B-C exchange) will come under attack.]

(;B[ed]LB[dk:A][bl:B][cl:D][cn:C][hq:E]C[Maybe this was premature I think I should jump at e8 here instead of tenuki to put more pressure on his group and build an attacking point later.

janr: A seems the best move to me.  then, (1) white can't connect underneath at B, (2) therefore, whites C group gets weak and heavy (3) the D stone doesn't get captured (4) the probability that white will have time to invade at E (making a second weak group) gets lower]
;W[iq]C[This hurt I think I should have respoded but I think I would fall to fat behind giving into this so I played d15 to try and make it evener.

janr: white clearly complicates the game.]
(;B[ce]LB[dk:A][go:B]C[

janr: the heated fight is not at the top left.  It is urgent to take the initiative at the bottom andor left side.
I still like A (or B if you really don't want to have running groups)]
;W[io]LB[cl:C][fp:A][kp:B]C[
janr: now the A group gets weak, and the B group gets weak, and there is no time anymore to save C.]
;B[go];W[oq]C[here wasn't sure seemed like I would fall to far behind if he got to play back to the top so I ignored but maybe should fix

janr: this is a complicated fight.  In such fight, it is much more important to get the advantage / initiative in the fight than thinking about falling behind in territory.]

(;B[bd]LB[dk:D][hm:C][kn:B][io:G][np:A][nq:F][oq:E]C[
janr:: as said, the fight is in the bottom.  There is no time to play slowly in the upper left spending three moves to get the corner.

Moves such as A, B or C or even D seem better as they contribute to managing the fight.

If black spends moves to take the upper left, white loses one stone.  If white spends moves to take a group in the lower side, black will at least lose 2 stones.

In fact, also E is a bit at the border of the fight.Black could abandon  F and just play B to attack G.]
;W[kn];B[no]LB[np:A]C[
janr: A is the more normal shape];W[nr]C[Wasn't sure after here just stuck with proverb and built a thick group to fight with in hope that I could live and not lose to much.]

(;B[np]LB[no:A][lq:D][mq:C][nq:E][nr:B]C[If black plays A to be lighter than the normal shap, why then connect and become heavy after white plays B?  It would be more consistent to play C or D  or ... not insisting on saving E]
;W[mr];B[nl]C[
janr: black runs away with a heavy eye-less group.  This is a costly rescue operation.]

;B[eb];W[ee];B[de];W[nj]C[This hurt wasn't sure how to handle maybe just jump towards center was better?]

(;B[ok]C[janr: black runs to the side in a heavy way.  How about the variation?  I feel they resist a bit better]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri]
(;B[ll];W[mm]
(;B[ml]LB[ln:C][po:A][op:B]C[
The disadvantage of omitting preparatory attachments at A,B,C ... is that white may be able to peep and force white to connect without eyes (or as here get cut)]
;W[on];B[nm];W[nn];B[lm];W[ln];B[mn]C[Read this ko but seems no way to win it.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[mm]
(;B[oi];W[mn]LB[eq:B][fr:A]C[
janr: it is better forwhite to continue the ko.  White can find ko threats around A and B.  Even if white looses the ko, he will get some compensation in the form of a good white wall and some territory.]
;B[oj]LB[pi:A][nj:B]C[janr: this makes whites A stones weak and whites B stone worthless.]
;W[qe]C[Here seems top side was more interesting so I tenukied.]
;B[gb]LB[od:A]C[
janr: this tenuki is only an endgame move on the second line.  Playing A would put pressure on whites group on the right.]
;W[ic]LB[od:A][qg:B]C[After here the game was over as you can see and I just hoped for a mistake which I didn't see him make any.

janr: hoping for a mistake works best if you complicate the game and dont play endgame on the second line.  So why not play A or even the overplay at B ?]
;B[hb];W[je]
(;B[og];W[qg]C[Here I said to have any hope I have to overplay so I tried to cut e6 and it didn't go to poorly.


janr: white will play r13 as soon as possible, but I would still prefer to play the variation.]

[dm:A][dn:C]C[
janr: as white can connect a B, why not first play A and force white to connect at C, so B doesn't work anymore?]
