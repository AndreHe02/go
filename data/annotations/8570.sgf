AB[dp][pd][pp]C[C: Hi, I'm about 2d based on playing in Tokyo, Japan. I'll mark my comments with a C, just so you know it's me. Just a small fyi, take what I say with a grain of salt. There's a lot of players out there stronger than me, so I'm by no means recommending the best moves! With that said, I'll do my best to analyze the game and try to point out where you could have done better.

myopian [3k\]: hi];W[cd];B[ec];W[gc];B[ee];W[df]
(;B[ef]C[C: The common joseki move is at H16, aiming to build the wall facing down. This move is not too bad though, aiming to build influence and not let white settle the G17 stone.


comment?];W[dg];B[ge]C[C: Not too slow, but not the right plan. You already have the power of the handicap stones and need to play more actively. Consider the attack at K17.


too slow?];W[id]C[C: White settles for free and now this looks like a 2-stone handicap game.]
;B[kc];W[dc]C[C: White is preventing the sente move at C15.


this seemed to help black];B[db];W[cb];B[dd];W[cc];B[de];W[ce]
;B[if]C[C: The wrong direction. The black group on top left is not in trouble, so L15 is the natural attacking move.]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[hd];B[ld];W[kf];B[jg]C[C: This move is fine.


ok?];W[kg];B[fb]C[C: Very bad! You have already committed to the center, coming back to try to make the base is too easy on white.]
;W[jh]C[C: Now the influence is gone and black is left with a weak group.]
;B[ih];W[jf];B[gb]C[C: You're correct, it looks like you may have been intimidated. You were the attacker, not the defender.


too soft?];W[ig];B[hg];W[ii];B[hh];W[cn];B[cl]C[C: This move is bad. The pincer is for building influence, but now a wall in both directions doesn't help black. Facing up is the D13 stone and facing right is the J11 stone. F4 is a natural response.


played without reading... ok?];W[cj]C[C: Yes, it is fine for white to play the normal joseki. It looks like he is complicating things and trying to bait out a mistake from you.


overplay?];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[eh];W[bg];B[dk];W[en]C[C: F4 is the natural continuing move. D9 is not yet in trouble because white's own group at E6 is weak.


black would of course like to play g4 but couldnt read what would happen to d9 - comment?]
;B[ei];W[fp];B[fq];W[ep]C[C: Your moves are fine up until D2. Cutting on the other side is correct.


unusual... how to handle? d5?];B[eq];W[dq]
(;B[dr]C[C: Should be C3.];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[qf];B[pi];W[qc];B[qd]C[C: Yes, the other side is too concentrated.


correct side?];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[oc];W[re];B[pb];W[qb];B[ql]
C[C: The general principle here is the "iron pillar" shape. You can play R11 to emphasize the side or R4 to protect the corner. The move played in the game is not enough for either.


wasnt sure where to play here - is there a general principle that applies?]
;W[qq]C[C: The invasion is natural. Notice if your R8 stone were on R11 instead, you could build a wall facing up and have a very nice shape.]
;B[pq]C[C: I would block on the other side.];W[qp];B[po]C[C: It is better to hit the head at R5 here, because of the influence of the R8 stone.]
;W[rn];B[qn]C[C: This move is fine now, but the result is much worse than if you had played R5 to begin with.


ok?];W[rm]
(;B[qk]C[C: Locally, I'm not sure why you wouldn't just play R7 instead and defend the cut directly. However, it is important to salvage something from the wall and play H4 immediately. The black stones are not in immediate danger.


didnt like to have to play this - it seems too passive, but where instead?]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[qo];W[ro];B[nq];W[hp]C[C: This is the important point. Now the point difference is unclear.]
;B[dj]C[C: Now it is because of H4.


was this necessary?];W[ci];B[iq]C[C: Why so passive? You have to play J4 for the extra points.]
;W[fk];B[gk]C[C: I see what you're trying to do, but I would play standard here.]
;W[gj];B[fj];W[ek];B[el];W[fl]C[C: Not a big difference here. This sequence is questionable, because although you take sente, you give up a lot in the middle and still don't end up covering G11.


considered g8 - would it have made a big difference?  i didnt want to end in gote]
;B[ej];W[hj];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[hk];B[gl];W[fm];B[ip];W[io]
;B[jo];W[jn];B[in]C[C: This is an amateur move. Always better to play the double hane directly.]
;W[ho];B[kn];W[jm]C[C: Points-wise, it's very close, I can't really tell who's winning from a cursory count on the board. In this case, sente is very important. As for your question, it's hard to see what else you could have done, J4 is too important to pass up and the double-hane is a natural continuation. In any case though, this is not a good use for the black wall, the territory-for-influence trade on the lower right is now very favorable for white.

i decided to just push up as my side was bigger than his - but was it too soft to sacrifice k10?]
;B[km];W[kl];B[jl];W[im];B[ll];W[kk];B[lk]
(;W[il]C[C: No, white cannot kill the stones. See variation for white block from the other side.


mistake by w?];B[kj];W[jk];B[lj];W[le];B[lc]C[C: Yes, this is too passive. The white group is not yet alive and there is still a big chance to make points.

too passive? n15 instead?];W[nf];B[pg]C[C: The chance to attack the white group is gone. It is better to take a big endgame point such as B2.

wasnt sure about this - looks like there must be somewhere better]
;W[li];B[lm];W[ob]C[C: Very big endgame move.];B[nb];W[pa];B[mi]
;W[mh];B[nh];W[mg];B[eg]C[C: Yes, you should take care of the possible ko fight at H14 first.

waste of a ko threat?];W[cf];B[kq]C[C: The handicap advantage is far gone, points-wise it is still very close. Judging by the margin at the end of the game, a move like B2 would have won you the game. I would recommend doing a quick points estimate at the beginning of the endgame and keep the difference in mind, it is worrying if you thought black had a sure win in this position.

unnecessary? better to defend o11? i thought i was miles ahead so played here as a "please resign" move - but i was wrong... i forgot w had 4 corners.... maybe this was the losing move?  or had b already let his handicap advantage slide away?]
;W[ni];B[mj];W[oh];B[nj];W[oi];B[oj];W[ph];B[qh];W[og]
(;B[qi];W[pf];B[rl]C[C: B2 is better, the right side has two open skirts.]
;W[mb]C[C: Another big endgame move by white, now it looks like he is slightly ahead.]
;B[mc];W[na];B[nc];W[br]C[C: Here's the last big move.];B[lb]
;W[ma];B[bm];W[bn];B[bk];W[em];B[ca]C[C: There is a free follow-up sente move, probably better to just answer at D8.]

;W[qs];B[sh];W[sg];B[ds]C[C: I'm not sure why you don't like to follow-up on the moves at Q1 and T12. Maybe you want sente, but then it's better to just not play those moves to begin with.]

;W[jg];B[tt];W[tt]C[C: The big things I would advise you to work on after seeing this game is your endgame and using influence. The former is big, you played decently until the last 50 moves or so, then it seems like you just turned off. I know you thought you were ahead, but that's a part of it too. A good endgame can swing the game by 20 points or more, you'll improve by at least 1 stone in strength if you improve here.

The second thing is using influence to attack. Handicap games are a bit unique in that it forces you to start on the 4-4. You might like to play more territory-oriented openings in an even game, but learning how to use your walls to attack is very important, otherwise you're just giving away territory for free. Black had a strong position after the opening, but you never used your strong positions to start a fight, the weak white group in the center got away without any trouble. Remember that the essence of Go is attack, territory is just something you get on the side. Try playing with more influence-type openings in your even games and get familiar with that side of it too.]
