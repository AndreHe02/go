C[cuauhtle [5k\]: hi
cuauhtle [5k\]: have a good game

* Hi, I'll be reviewing this game for Black];B[pd]C[Chemist [5k\]: hi]
;W[pp];B[dq];W[dd];B[co]C[Cuauhtle: Even it is the 5th move , some alwaysa say black should attack since there is komi, though I like this shape of first 3 stones. But is it really suitable for a good following for black?

* Don't listen to them naysayers ;) There's nothing wrong with this move, in fact, after checking in a pro fuseki database I found at least seven 9p vs. 9p games that began exactly like this.

* Of course White's next move is unusual, but that's another story. The "standard" approach would be for White to respond on the lower side, but not as close as he did. So much for the theory part.]

(;W[fp]C[* See variation

* Now White makes a move which seems to be testing you, an obvious way to respond would be to make a pincer attack on the lower side, but I guess that's a matter of what kind of a plan for the game you have.]

(;B[cf]TR[co]LB[fc:a][qn:b]C[* See variation. This move is from the wrong side, there's less to be gained on the left side since there's already a low stone at C5. You should approach from F17 or R6, with R6 you have to take into account the F4 stone.]

(;W[ch]C[* I would respond at the top instead, there's no worry about Black bulding a moyo on the left side because of the C5 stone. Besides, White F4 is already reducing the would-be moyo anyway.

* See variation];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce]
;B[fc];W[cl]C[Cuauhtle: Should black play somewhere around G16 or smth , because in some josekis W play G15 to defend centre side.

* If you're afraid of White G15 then G17 is the move, another possibility is F16. I wouldn't invade as you did just yet.]
;B[cj]C[Cuauhtle: overplay?

* Unnecessary aggression, but it turned out well for Black. I would play on the lower or right side instead.

* There's so much unclaimed land at the moment that an invasion clearly indicates that you have an aggressive attitude :)]
;W[ei]C[* This move is bad, it accomplishes nothing while trying to take territory from the wall's side, White needs to play from the other direction here, D9 would be the move.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[el];W[ck];B[bm];W[en]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[bk];W[bj];B[bl];W[ci];B[gl]C[* This turned out well for Black, White is terribly overconcentrated with his ponnuki formation almost touching the wall, his stones are placed inefficiently. Black has gained a nice corner.

* See that White has all of her stones (except Q4 and F4 stones) concentrated in one place of the board, moreover they are terribly overconcentrated, this is already a lost game for White, I believe]
;W[jp]C[* Seems like White is asking for trouble this way.]
;B[hp]C[* Good, severe attack.];W[iq]C[* This is another mistake, White is handing his stones over to Black.]
;B[fq]C[* I'd just play H3 instead, it's a strong shape.];W[gq]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[gn];W[eq];B[fr];W[ep];B[er];W[cq];B[dp];W[cr]

(;B[cp]C[* See variation instead.];W[dr];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[es];B[ds];W[cs];B[gr];W[hr];B[go];W[br]C[Cuauhtle: Should black start the ko or just play anywhere else bigger? (since it can be considered to be the early mid-game B has not so much serious threats, does he?.)

* White has one local ko threat and four big ones at the top, starting with E17. Black doesn't have any definite ko threats, so just let the ko be for the time being.]
;B[ap];W[aq];B[bq];W[pj]C[* If so, I'd finish the ko now (around 30 points) and White won't be able to prevent an invasion with his next move.

* You have still your Q16 stone's potential to use and White will be uncomfortable because his K4 group is so likely to come under attack in case any fight ensues.

* Still, the ko is not a burden for Black so your course may just be right as well.]
;B[np];W[bp];B[kq]C[* That's severe, White is really in trouble now.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[ao]C[* Now the game became an attack-feast for Black - so many targets!]

(;B[nn]C[* That's maybe too mild, what about attaching at Q3 (variation).]
;W[km];B[po]C[* I wouldn't touch like this, touching usually makes opponent stronger, I'd play Q6 instead and let him struggle in the corner, this way White gets a big corner.]
;W[qp];B[an]C[* That's a 3 point sente move - very small and you lose a valuable ko threat. Why play it now?]
;W[ap]C[* Now you only have one ko threat left in the corner.]
;B[qo];W[op];B[oo];W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp]C[* White got a big corner, but his situation is otherwise bad.]
;W[jl];B[rp];W[rq];B[pr];W[oq];B[ro]C[* Nice combination.];W[qr]
C[Cuauhtle: Here, should bkack worry about making life on right side? or can he play just some other place like R14 or O16?

* Worry is too big a word but Black should definitely keep an eye on his group while attacking White. O16 would be the worse choice, I'd play around Q12/R12, maybe a line higher, or around N8. White N8 would be painful now because it makes a nice shape for White and helps the Q10 stone a lot.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[ql];W[qj];B[jd]C[* Why on this side and not take White's base away with R13? White now has the ideal extension to R14. After making yourself strong you have to attack, you gave White a big corner at Q4, remember?]
;W[hc]C[* White is chaotic, R14 seems to be the top priority.]
;B[fd];W[he];B[ff];W[df]C[* This is so small. White needs to do something with one of his 3 weak groups, you can't defend your territory with moves like this when the outcome of the whole game depends on your ability to stabilize multiple weak groups elsewhere. White simply doesn't have time for D14.]
;B[ge];W[jc];B[kc];W[id];B[jb];W[ic];B[kd];W[nc];B[hf]C[* Try J14 instead.]
;W[je];B[if];W[ie];B[ke];W[jf];B[nd];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]
;W[qe];B[ae]C[Cuauhtle: can white tenuki here and play Q14? IIn some sources i have read that it is super-urgent?

* White's situation is pretty terrible overall, I don't see a way. Q14 is sure big.]
;W[af];B[ad];W[bf]
(;B[lg]C[* Wrong direction. You're strong at  the top right, so I'd push in that direction, looking forward to attacking K8 and G10 stones. Here, you're basically making territory from your strong stones, overconcentrated.]
;W[jh]C[* See, now White is getting connected...];B[jn];W[kn]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[mk]C[* I'd prefer K10 instead.];W[pf];B[of];W[pg]
;B[jj]C[* Very good. This is basically the moment for White to think about resigning (if it wasn't some time ago already, that is)]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[ib];B[kb];W[gg];B[hk]C[* Nice finish. I won't comment on yose as you have an overwhelming advantage right now and there's really no point.

* White lost this game due to big mistakes in the direction of play in the fuseki and middle game and overall chaotic play.

* In the future please rememner that it is customary to ask for reviews about games that you lost, not won (even less by a huge margin like this one), you really learn more that way.

* Commentary ends here. Merry Christmas!];W[gf];B[fg];W[gh]
