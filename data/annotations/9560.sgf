C[Hello dear reviewer,

I am black in this match.

I felt I had the upper hand in the game but I messed up and lost a big fight on the top.

Later i failed to kill the lower right corner and in yose I couldn`t find a way to capture the center group.



I will appreciate any comments and ideas,thank you :)];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj];W[mc]LB[fc:A][qf:B]C[janr: rather unusual approach.
A or B would be more common]
(;B[kc]LB[oc:A]C[N17 looks weird,I decided to pincer due to my left side

janr: still, A seems a solid a good move.  If white extends it is still possible for black to develop the left side by putting pressure.  See variation.]
;W[pf]LB[kc:B][mc:A]C[I dont think this is a joseki

janr: no, I don't know any joseki starting with A and B.];B[qf]
C[janr: I feel this unnecessarily strengthens white.  Both pincer stones a far from the 3-3 point so it should be possible to play without touching the pincer stones, e.g. by just splitting them.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[ic];B[fc]LB[kb:A][ld:B]C[janr: Now white can "connect" at A.  I would therefore prefer Black B]
;W[pc];B[oc]LB[qc:A]C[janr: A seems possible too. Black gets a good corner and can then attempt to split whites stones.]

(;B[mg]LB[lb:A][ic:B][me:C]C[habr:  I would prefer to play A, connecting the complete black position.
Especially as I expect that black will answer a white move at A threatening to connect with B.
Once all blacks stones are connected, he can play forcefully and even if the C stones try to escape, their life will be difficult]
;W[ke]
(;B[kg]C[janr: black is chasing white into the direction of his own moyo/territory.
This is dangerous, especially if there is a chance that white lives.
I whould still prefer the variation.];W[jf]LB[id:A]C[Perhaps A now?]
;B[jg];W[if];B[id];W[ig];B[ih];W[hh]
(;B[hi]C[janr: a double hane often looses sente as you have to come back to defend.  How about the extension ?]
;W[gi];B[hg]C[I guess this was an overplay,probably just connecting on j12 is enough?]
;W[gh];B[gf];W[ge];B[ff];W[hd];B[mb]LB[fe:A]C[Later I thought that maybe A is better in this position

janr: connecting is needed at some point, so it seems ok to do it now.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[fe];B[ef];W[ec]LB[lb:A][mb:B][kc:D][mc:C][ed:E]
C[janr: I think A is better than B, as now white can play A and get stones on the second line be sacrificing C.

even so, once D is connected, white is not completely alive.
Can black keep white eyeless, e.g. by playing E ?]
(;B[eb]C[Black is messing up.

I am probably trying to kill white too much.

janr: saving the black stone is not crucial.  The important thing is to let white live small if it is impossible to kill.]

(;B[bb]C[janr: if white can make an eye with five points, he will win the semeai.
I think black b19 is better (veriation)];W[ab];B[ba];W[ea]LB[da:A]
C[D19 for black?

janr: A is indeed the vital point.
If white plays there he wins the semeai with a big eye.
if now black throws in there he gets at least a ko.]

Thanks for your time

janr: it seems black insufficiently protected his attacking groups, and white captured a black corner while the intention was that white would live small.]
