C[I'm most interested in general comments on my game play and advice on which areas I need to work on. Though obviously comments on specific moves are welcome.

Thanks in advance for the review!


om3: Hello,

thanks for the opportunity to review your game. I tried to answer your questions, and in addition, I tried my best to make up your main mistakes. Some of these remained unpunished, but as your level increases, your opponents will make use of mistakes like these. 
Since many of the mistakes concern the direction of play, I suggest you watch a lot of strong players games to get a feeling for that. Another possibility to improve is to do a lot of tsumego (life and death problems). A particular example in this game is your treatment of the group in the lower right, where your mistake cost you about 10 points; but mistakes like this might easily cost you more.

I will tag my comments with "om3", so that you can well distinguish them from your own.

Best regards,
Daniel];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qk];W[np];B[oq];W[nq]C[I was unsure how to respond to black 7, I feared that he would respond with a pincer. Was this the correct response, what should I have done if he had pincered?

om3: This move is perfectly fine, if you don't play it, b plays there. There's no need to be afraid of a pincer here, in particular because you have a nice Tesuji at q5, see variant.]

(;B[pn];W[jp];B[fq]
(;W[hq]C[om3: A somewhat inefficient move, since you already have a pincer stone at k4. I prefer the diagonal attachment here. (see variant)]

(;B[dr]LB[dn:B][cq:A]C[om3: A very heavy move by b. There's no point in putting more weight to a stone that cannot make any territory either way. Better would be to invade at A or counter pincer at B.]
;W[cq];B[cr]
(;W[gr]C[I was trying to wreck his eyespace with this move. Would F5 have been better?

om3: I like the idea of taking b's base, but the corner at b2 looks better for that purpose than g2.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[bq];W[bp];B[dq];W[cp];B[aq]C[om3: Now, the corner is pretty big for b, and his group should be safe.]
;W[ap];B[br]LB[bs:A]C[om3: Bad shape, leaving aji behind. Should be at A to easily secure life.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[cj];B[ch];W[cf]C[om3: good move.];B[eh]
(;W[ff]C[om3: Although moves like this are sometimes playable, you have to make them with care and some plan in mind. In the game this stone turned out to be displaced later, so you probably would've done better with a more conventional move here. (see variants)]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[md]LB[ic:D][jc:B][id:C][jd:A]TR[fc][fd]
C[om3: It is urgent here to pincer the two marked b stones, W should play at one of the points A-D. Playing that far from the heavy b group gives b the opportunity to make a base for this group and at the same time pincering your n16 stone by playing at A or B. This kind of moves should never be left unplayed!!]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[qg];W[ic]C[om3: Huge point. Now the game is good for w.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[ef]C[Was there any way I could have stopped this connection?

om3: This is not yet a proper connection as you have d13!]

;W[fk];B[lo]
(;W[lp]C[om3: Too passive. As you are very strong around, jump out and attack!]
;B[mo];W[kp];B[no];W[jn]LB[dg:B][jm:A]C[I thought a long time about this move, I couldn't see a better one. Any suggestions?

om3: First of all, d13 is still big, second, because of your thickness at the lower side k6 should be a bit farther away, at least at A.]

;B[pj];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni]LB[mi:A][pi:B]C[om3: This is terrible shape. There is no need to reinforce this connection here, and if there would be, you would play at A, at the same time threatening to cut b. Even better would be to use this move to cut in B's side by playing at B.]
