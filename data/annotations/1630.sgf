C[Hi Daniel,

I reviewed your game, and I hope that my comments are helpful for you. One piece of advice that might enable you to improve your game is this: look for the weak groups on the board, and think about attacking your opponents' groups in order to make territory or gain strength yourself; even if your opponent can live, don't make it easy for him.  Look at moves 43 and 87 to see how this could have changed this game.

If you have any further questions, just write me an email!

Regards,

Ulrich

(;W[qm]C[I don't think that this is a good invasion point for white. The standard play at Q5 seems preferable.]

(;B[qo]C[Good. Another idea might be to play at R9 or S8, because the white stone
at R7 is a little bit too far from the black corner (see variation).]
;W[qi]C[This invites a black splitting attack, so it is questionable, I think.]
;B[rk]C[Good.];W[oi];B[nk];W[mi];B[lk];W[pb]
(;B[mf]C[Jumping out is the right idea. Black should keep in mind though, that he does not want to help white to solidify his territory on the top. See the variation for a sequence that might be more severe on white.]
;W[ki];B[md]C[Black should be very reluctant to play here, since this helps white to defend his weakness at M17. So unless it is absolutely necessary, black should avoid moves like this. It seems to be better to jump out further into the center, maybe after playing forcing moves against the white P11 group.]
;W[mc];B[kf];W[ld];B[jg];W[oj];B[ok];W[jj]
(;B[jl]C[Now that there is no strong attack on the white group anymore, black should also think about defending his territory in the lower left.  Another option would be to play a double approach move at F17. The move you played feels a bit slack to me.]
;W[hi];B[hf];W[hd];B[ge]C[Once again: if white answers here, he makes quite a lot of territory, so an exchange like this should be made only if absolutely necessary.]
;W[pr]
(;B[qr]C[It's hard to say, but white probably will get something with his play at Q2, so black has to decide what he wants to give up. In this case, allowing white to live small in the corner and taking the outside looks quite interesting, so P3 might be better. See the variation.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qq];W[lq]
(;B[op]C[This is a small-scale move. I think it is better to separate the white stones by playing at L2 or so. It's not completely obvious how white is going to live, and if he does, black will be able to build up some strength facing the left.]
;W[nq];B[or]C[Again, it would be better to separate white. White gains much more by connecting his groups than you get by capturing the one stone at Q2. If you play at L2, you have follow-ups on both sides, and white can only defend against one of them.]
;W[nr];B[ps];W[np];B[oo];W[jq]C[This is a great success for white.]
;B[cn];W[hk];B[fq]C[Might be an overplay - white is strong around here. I think black should first play at G16 - that is very big territorially, and the single white stone in the corner should come under pressure.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[fo];W[em];B[dl];W[hm];B[ho];W[dj];B[ck]
C[Black c5 first looks better. It threatens to cut, and if white protects against that, black will be able to take the corner.]
;W[cj];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[el];B[gd]C[Good. Although white can take a few stones at C7, black will be able to live in the corner, and G16 is a huge move.]
;W[cm];B[bn];W[cl];B[bl];W[dk]
(;B[cq]C[D3 instead looks better.];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fr]
;B[hc]C[Attacking the white stone at D16 is more urgent now. Just shutting white in with E14 might be good enough.]
;W[be];B[ef];W[bf];B[ic];W[eb]C[Now white got a big corner.]

(;B[cc]C[This is probably too late - since the white group in the corner can easily connect to the outside, it is in no danger. On the other hand, the white stones around O17 are not very strong anymore, so black should be able to make some points attacking that group
(see variation).];W[cd];B[ec];W[dc];B[fc]C[Much too small at this point ...]
;W[qc]C[... and white takes a *really* big point.  There are only very few comments after this point.]
