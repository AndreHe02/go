C[Hi, my name is Chayne Thrash and I played black in this game. In this game my opponent ended up having two weak groups which I attacked through most of the game, but I'm not sure if I attacked from the right directions at all times. All comments and suggestions are appreciated. If you have any suggestions on how I should study to improve or any books to read, those will be greatly appreciated as well.

Hi, my name is Thomas, and I will do my best to comment this game out.  I have not read a lot of books, so I will not really going to help you.  I studied some josekies, not to get lost ... and I did lots of tsumego and reading reviews of games played by players +1 ou +2 k.  I am now 1k, I play on KGS (zamoth) mostly blitz games because I never have time to play long games (family). I did this review on my lunch time, please excuse my english mistakes as I am French.

My comments will all start with "Zam :"];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd]
;B[ec]C[Zam : try to avoir playing between two stones when possible. But no actual problem at actually]
;W[dc]C[This move by white too slow right? Or is that only when the stone is on the star point that its considered slow?

Zam : much better for White when having a stone at K16. This is OK though.]
;B[ed];W[df];B[ic];W[op];B[pn];W[lp];B[pq];W[ql];B[oq];W[nq]
;B[pl]C[I used this move to try to gain power so that I could pressure the weak group.

Zam : this is not a very good move.  White has plenty of space, you are not going to kill him, and this leaves too many weaknesses on black's shape.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[qn];B[po]C[I think I should've just moved to R5 here.

Zam : I like this better. as white groups on both side have not very good shapes and black is now fully connected.  You eventually lose 2 or three points in the bottom ... so what, have a very strong group is more important in the opening, than 3 points]
;W[qj];B[jq]TR[po]C[Should I have went ahead and capped at P10 to threaten to white side to prevent him from jumping out himself with it?

Zam : No, this is perfect. At this point, the white right group is safe, don't get into the opponents influence when you can attack instead.  this is good, because Q5 made your group strong.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[ln];B[oj]CR[nc][dj][cn][fq][gq]C[ZAM : This move is slow ... does not cut, does not threatens, does not kill, does not make any points.  I showed you other possibilities which are all better.]
;W[gp];B[gr]C[Looking back now, would the contact play at g3 have been more effective?

Zam : No touching a stone make it stronger.  Since this invasion is not bad, you muse live with it and strenthen your weakest group.  This is a good way to do it.  You now have to be reasonable and not to try to get everything.]
;W[fq];B[jn];W[ll];B[jl];W[kk]TR[gp][fq]C[I feel like this was too slow and had no real purpose behind it. I think if white was planning on attacking me he should have used the knights move and really should have stabilized his group before attacking anyway.

Zam : Yes, this is not very effective.  Should be trying to gain velocity on bottom group instead.]
;B[hq]C[I was trying to make sure my group wasn't it danger when I moved here. However, Would I have been strong enough to just continue the attack without being defensive here?

Zam : This is not a "very fast" move, but is makes you group looking very much like a living group.  So this is not a bad move since it is your only weak group.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[dr];W[eq];B[cp];W[en]
(;B[cn]TR[dk][dl][dm]C[Zam : This is slow.  Your group at the bottom seems like living.  The goban has plenty of wide open spaces, and you play too close to a living group. In this case, try to go one or two stone further.  even if white cuts, you can live by pushing another stone further on the side.  See var]
;W[jk]C[Zam : Dangerous for white, as the bottom group is not alive yet]
;B[gm];W[io];B[jo];W[im]C[Zam : I would have cut here]
(;B[jm]C[Zam : But this is ok.];W[in];B[il];W[el];B[cl];W[hm]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[fl];W[gk];B[fm];W[fk];B[em];W[dm];B[dl];W[gn]
;B[ek];W[fn];B[el];W[dn];B[cm];W[ip];B[iq];W[hp];B[ij];W[gi]
C[Zam : your next move is not good, as it is purely territorial.  It does not really attack white, the black center group is not alive yet, and white can cut. See var]
(;B[dh];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj]C[I knew I was going to get cut off but I thought it would be better to keep these two groups separated to keep pressure on them.]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[ii];W[gh];B[ig];W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[gd];W[hf]
;B[if];W[eg];B[mr]TR[fr][kr]C[Taking away the base.

Zam : Before taking away a base, Black should save his group. What if white L3, then F2 ? You are lucky white answered as he did.]
;W[nr];B[kr];W[mq];B[lr];W[is];B[er];W[fr];B[fs];W[cr]C[White was desperate here.]
;B[br];W[es];B[ds];W[gs];B[hs]
(;W[gq]C[Zam : Useless. White lives anyway];B[nd]C[Zam : Finally.  I would prefere one line higher]
;W[pf];B[nf];W[ph];B[mj]C[I'm not completely sure why I made this move. I probabaly should have just did another jump at O12 to make my frame work stronger.

Zam : I would have played P17 to make territory in sente first.]
;W[pk]TR[nh]C[Zam : Let white cut 2 living groups. play O12 instead]
;B[ok];W[nl]TR[ro]C[Zam : Same. Play S5 to make points];B[ol]

;B[di]C[I think I should have ignored the peep and played a larger sente move.

Zam : yes, ignore this.];W[kg];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[lg];B[lf]
;W[ms];B[of];W[pg];B[ls]C[Zam : too slow. D18, Q18 A14 S5, Q2 are all bigger]
;W[ns];B[ro];W[qo]C[Zam : S4 better.];B[pp];W[rn];B[rq];W[qs]
;B[rr]C[Zam : R2 better];W[so]C[Zam : Don't answer yet. 2 points only]

;B[fa];W[ih];B[hh];W[jh];B[so];W[lh]C[Zam : I felt the game was even.  Both could have loose a major group.  Do not forget : Play away from strengh.  One a group lives, do not extend it by one (move 43). Of course, some life and death mistakes, but you are 10k, so no problem.  But the end game was really not good. you lost too many points on this end game. Do not forget that it is easier to make points this way : corner, side, center.  When entering in endgame phase, try looking for moves this way (after having considered shape/groups major problems)

Best regards, hope this will help you
