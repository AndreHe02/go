C[*******
I will put all my comments below like this.];B[pc];W[qp];B[dq]
;W[dc]C[*****
I presume you wanted this type of opening. Typically it induces a lot of fighting. You have a fighting style, so that's good.]
;B[ce];W[ee]C[****
This is not typical Joseki. This is a trick play, but it seems you do not know the trick.]

(;B[dg]
(;W[hd]C[White stone is too close. See variation for black]

(;B[do];W[cl]C[*******
This invasion is too early. Black's stones can easily secure themselves. The thickness gained will make territory and influence elsewhere.]
;B[cj]C[**********
This is a perfect black response.];W[bn];B[bo];W[ek];B[hp];W[ep]
C[*********
This is a bad overplay. White is not settled on top, and black is strong. White will be split and in troubl.e]
;B[dp];W[fo]
(;B[lq]C[****
This is too easy on white. See variation.];W[oq];B[fq];W[fm]
;B[qi];W[pe]C[*************
This is overaggressive. Black attacks and white needs to run, and black gains.]

;B[qg]C[*************
Black now has a large corner. White has a very innefficient clump of stones. 

Fighting where your opponent is so strong results in these types of outcomes.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[pd];B[pb];W[mb];B[nb]C[****
This just gives black more points.];W[cd]C[*********
This is a good move, as was shown in the variation at the beginning of the game. It's still a good move.]
;B[ke]C[***********
Black is thinking he wants to prevent white from sealing off this area. But he is so thick there, he could probably still get in even after white played there.

White needs to attack the D13 group. White is strong there and needs to get points.]

(;W[jf];B[kf];W[kg]C[These moves are small and do little. White is benefiting though, because the outside is strengthening.]
;B[je];W[if]C[****
White cannot play here, though due to black's attack.  White must play K17.]

White got lucky here and black made a mistake.]

White gets away, but the black stones are helpful in keeping the middle from going to white.]

(;W[di]C[*******
This move eliminates attack possibilities on the black stones. Not good.]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[ch];W[eg];B[cf];W[de];B[df];W[km]C[**********
While this attack is nice, it would have been better to attack black from two directions, as earlier.]

This was nicely done by black. A disaster for white.

The game is quite lopsided at this point. No further comments until the end.]

Moria,

I believe you are playing too many fast internet games. It seems that you make many aggressive moves and hope for your opponent to make a mistake that you can take advantage of.  As you grow stronger, your opponents will make fewer of these mistakes, and you will cease to progress. 

Generally, attacking is done later, and when you have prepared more with stones somewhere nearby to run to.

Consider expanding your own areas rather than attacking your opponents.

Go is a balance of attack and growing your own territories. Right now you are too far leaning toward the attacking side. Learn to give up heavy groups which are not doing much good.

Good luck with your games!
