C[bucky:  Hi reviewer! My name is Mark Fyffe and I played black in this game.  I had a lot of tough decisions to make in this game, and in each case I tried to maintain balance and a clear path to victory.  But as it happened, I miscalculated and lost the game by 2.5 even though I felt in control the whole time (perhaps I should count komi next time ;-).  In addition to advice on these key parts of the game, I'd appreciate general comments on how to think 'slightly bigger'.  Thanks!

forfun (ff): This was an interesting and exciting game.  Thanks for the chance to analyze it.  It seems like Black had a pretty good idea of the big issues.  The main point that I see in looking at the game is that Black (and White as well) could not find the correct way through the tactical situations.  I think that both players would quickly improve by concentrating on their fighting technique: drilling on tesuji and life and death problems to improve their reading ability in particular.

This is not a game where strategy plays a big part.  The two players fight hard from start to finish.  I have concentrated on the tactics of the fighting - there was a lot :-)]

;B[jp];W[dq]C[bucky: a blunder by white?

ff: This is clearly the wrong idea for White.  The corner is small and there are no heavy black stones to attack with this play.  Meanwhile the two White stones will be in difficulty.]
;B[jq];W[gp]
(;B[fp]C[ff: This is the fighting response.  It seems quite reasonable considering White's bad shape here.  Black could also consider the quiet approach to take advantage of White's strategic misplay - see the variation.]
;W[go]
(;B[fn]C[ff:  Black needs to ask here who is dominant?  Who has good shape and who has bad.  This move seems too weak - see the variation.]

(;W[hr]C[bucky: another blunder by white?  I'd expect K2 after my pooly placed play at G1.

ff: It makes no difference in this case - see the variation.]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[jr];W[ek];B[dm]C[ff: This play reduces Black's liberties.  Black needs to have read out that there are no complications arising from the various cutting points in his shape when deciding to do this.]
;W[cm]
(;B[cn]C[ff: Black is short of liberties so this causes problems.  Black should just back up and start to take off the dead stones.]
;W[eo]C[bucky: here is big decision number 1: kill or take over the left side.  I chose the left side for two reasons: it seemed much bigger in potential due to the thickness of having _all_ of white's space fully enclosed.  I also chose the left because I truly did not earn the kill (though I do not generally hesitate to take advantage of my opponent's mistakes).

ff: Capture the stones.  Black has made a mistake here but backing up to take off the stones is worth over 40 points and almost guarantees another 50 in the lower right.  White has to connect on the left in gote.  There is no way the game ends up a reasonable exchange for Black.]
;B[cl];W[ep];B[km]C[ff: If Black has to play here then the previous comment is even more true.  Black loses 40 points virtually in gote!]
;W[bm];B[bl]C[ff: This is bad suji.  If Black simply captures at D9, B6 later will capture two White stones.]
;W[bn];B[dk]C[ff: Black has ended in gote so White has the opportunity to play first on the right side.  Still, White's lower left is only worth about 35 points so Black's overall judgement was correct and Black is OK.]
;W[oq];B[pp];W[lp]
(;B[mq]C[ff: Black need not be tentative.  During the game I think Black did not realize how much White's ability to fight is affected by the shortage of liberties of the surrounded stones.  White has to play E1 and E3 from the other side before it is possible to attack Black.  See the variation.]

(;B[ls];W[ks];B[os];W[no];B[on]C[bucky: white is alive, and black dies.  Again, I prefer to enclose; is this the right thing to do?

ff: Yes, by now the outside is definitely bigger than the stones inside.  There are still two huge ko threats left over at J1 and J5 as well.]
;W[kq]
(;B[nn]C[ff: This is gote so better not to play it.];W[mn];B[mm]
;W[qi]
(;B[qk]C[ff: This is played from the wrong side. It is an example of trying to use thickness to make territory.  Black should approach from above and force the White stones up against the strong Black wall.]
;W[oi]C[ff: White jumps instead of making a base along the side.  In this case, however, Black's wll is so large that jumping out is not an easy way to escape.  Black should chase this group before White gets in another play.]
;B[gd];W[cg];B[dc]C[ff: This is a significant slip by Black.  This play is inconsistent with the original distant approach at G16.  Black is interested in the two White stones on the right side, not on the situation in the upper left corner.  In this sequence Black makes a small group in the upper left but White gets to settle the stones on the right side.  A big plus for White that has a big impact on the game.]
;W[cc];B[ed];W[cd];B[ec];W[qf]C[ff: White is very lucky.  Suddenly the value of Black's huge wall is greatly diminished by the two solid stones on P11 and C13.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]C[bucky: I count a slight lead for white, but with a difficult game against black's thickness.  Is this a fair estimate?  how can I make better use of the thickness?

ff: The point is that White as almost no chance for further territory.  The game hinges on whether White can directly limit Black's upper side.]

ff: Black's judgement is correct but mainly because White did not choose a very big ko threat.  This ko is so big that Black's threats on the bottom side will not work!  If White had fought harder, Black would have been in trouble.]
