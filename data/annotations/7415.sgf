C[Remi : hi

Some comments on how to send a game to the gtl first : you should review the game yourself and add some comments. It is thus much easier for the reviewer to see your weaknesses. I tried my best here. 

Overall, you seem to have a better feeling for the game than your opponent, except for the fight after your invasion at move 25. You played some gote moves, and got cut very badly. The influence white got was huge. With 3 weak groups and that influence, you were lucky not to die. 

In the end, white failed to make his group live, although he had many possibilities (He probably was overconfident and didn't think he would die...)

I pointed out some mistakes in the yose as well, and a lot of slack moves on your side. 

Remember Go Seigen's (was it go seigen ?) advice : fight for initiative. Leave small stones.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[qd];B[od]C[Remi : good];W[oc];B[nc];W[pc]
;B[md];W[qf];B[jc]LB[jd:A][ce:B]TR[dc]C[Remi : Your stones are low. I'd also consider A or B, which look better.]
;W[cn]LB[cj:A]C[Remi : I'd say wrong direction. D15 would flatten b's framework.

Black should also pincer. Bottom is less important than side]
;B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]
(;B[ce]LB[ci:A]C[a big framework for black, no?

Remi : I agree. A would be even bigger, if you like to fight.]
;W[jp]C[Remi : strange looking move. I'd choose Q5 instead]
;B[qk]C[was this a correct move? how to cope with positions like that?

Remi : Better at Q5 or R5, since R14 is low and solid.];W[qo]
;B[qh]C[Remi : now K4 looks better];W[hq];B[bq]LB[lq:A]C[Remi : Good. You don't want to be unsettled here. 
An invasion around A could be dangerous for white if you get a little more influence around M10.]
;W[cg];B[ci]C[I think this move was a rather bad idea...

Remi : looks feasible. Invading to remove points is not a good idea. Here, c8 is weak, so you should benefit from this.]

;W[bo]C[Remi : slow as well. But you can see that your invasion is a success. W is weak everywhere, and that'll help you make points on the upper side.]
;B[bm];W[cm];B[bl]LB[ee:B][gi:A]C[Remi : this is gote. You should play A or B instead]

(;W[cl]C[Remi : ???];B[ee]C[Remi : good shape point, and important point to develop the side]

(;B[gj]C[Remi : Big mistake here. Too heavy. You connect the stones that can be sacrificed.]

;B[fh];W[eh];B[ej];W[fk];B[fl];W[dj];B[el];W[di]C[Remi : obviously white is very happy. He connected his 2 weak groups. Now b can start invading everywhere.]
;B[bh];W[gl];B[jj]C[Remi : You can sacrifice these 3 stones. They are just a burden now that they don't cut anything.]
