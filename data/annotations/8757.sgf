AB[pd][dp]C[Jon:  Hi!  I'm Jon, your reviewer for this game.]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[qm];B[mq];W[op];B[oo]LB[pn:A][jq:B]C[spice:  Unsure of what to do here. Is the kosumi (A) better maybe?

Jon:  I don't think so - it's pretty clunky, and I don't feel any urgent need to activate the R-5 stone yet anyway.  It's so early in the game that I'd prefer to extend down the bottom side (B) and start working on sketching out the top/left sides.]
;W[no];B[on];W[mp];B[kq]
(;W[dd]LB[qp:A]TR[on][oo][qo]C[spice:  I think white's tenuki is a mistake, but where should he play instead?

Jon:  I'm not opposed to the tenuki.  If black wants to commit more time and resources to (only) gaining control of the bottom right, white would be happy to spread out quickly along the top and left sides in return.  If white wants to defend, I'd consider bumping the R-5 stone (A) and trying to counterpressure black's marked group.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[rq];W[qf];B[qh]TR[qm]C[Jon:  Pincering low is a possible concern - I'm worried about white trying to move out and press back down with white's marked stone in play, so playing this on the fourth line would be a bit more comfortable.]
(;W[qc]C[Jon:  I don't agree with the decision to invade.  You'll be pretty happy to build up the wall towards the right side, especially since a continued attack on white's bottom right group will allow you to expand in the process.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]
(;B[pl]LB[qk:A]TR[qm]C[spice:  Here I was unsure how to best use the thickness and I ended up pressing down. But it's a touch move and I'm not sure it's correct.

Jon:  It's a solid play, locking the white stone down pretty well, so I don't mind potentially causing contact here.  I'd also consider removing the base entirely by extending down to A.  He can't do much with the marked stone in response without getting forked (having two groups come under attack simultaneously).]
;W[cn];B[mn]LB[me:C][mm:A][nn:B]C[spice:  Is this the way to attack or is there better move? I think there must be.

Jon:  There's a better option - this is too thin and forced.  If you ease off slightly and play it one higher (A), you don't expose yourself to the push-and-cut that's currently an issue with white B, but still maintain effective pressure and set up a nice follow-up at C.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[om]LB[nl:A]C[Jon:  Extending up to A would be a bit better for restraining white's ability to push upward.]
;W[ml];B[ln];W[ko];B[km];W[jn];B[iq];W[lp];B[kk];W[mj];B[nk]
;W[mk]LB[me:A][nj:B]C[Jon:  I'm hesitant about this decision to keep the cutting stones alive.  White's going to have a relatively hard time defending the group with your center group keeping him pressed to the right.  There's also the issue of future plays such as black A, further restricting white's ability to move around and escape.  As white, I'd consider giving up the cutting stones and trying to reduce from a more lean and flexible position (e.g. pushing at B instead and jumping out lightly).]
(;B[me]LB[ki:A]TR[kk][km][ln][mn]C[Jon:  I'm thinking this is one step too early in terms of the timing.  Getting the jump at A first will keep white's escaping group restrained, but also make sure your marked group stays out of trouble.]
;W[jl];B[jm]C[Jon:  This exchange should be omitted.  You can't take advantage of the hole with an immediate cut, so doing this allows white to reinforce his bottom group.  It's better to connect directly and leave this as a possibility for later.]
;W[im];B[kl];W[in];B[ki];W[kn]C[Jon:  This exchange should also be omitted.  It's just removing aji and a potential ko threat.]
;B[lm];W[lh];B[li];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nh];W[kh];B[ji];W[kf]
;B[lc];W[ph];B[ng];W[qi];B[rh];W[oh];B[nj];W[oi];B[rf];W[nl]
C[Jon:  The sequence from this move to move 79 can be omitted to preserve ko threats for later.]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[qk];W[pm];B[qn];W[rk];B[rj];W[qj];B[rl];W[ld]
(;B[ne];W[kc]
(;B[oc];W[ob];B[mc];W[mb];B[md]C[spice:  I think these moves are too small, right?

Jon:  Yeah, I'd ignore it and start working on the bottom left.]
;W[lb];B[ke];W[je];B[jf];W[le];B[lf];W[kd];B[jh];W[mf];B[dn]
LB[dm:B][en:A]C[spice:  This is probably bad, right?

Jon:  I don't really like it, and would still prefer the keima at A.  The two moves have the same idea, but this direct attachment forces white to strengthen one of the forked groups immediately.  It also allows white to gain leverage while defending, then push towards the center as some part of his plan (e.g. continuing to push up after white B has been played).]
;W[dm]
(;B[co]LB[en:A]C[Jon:  I'm more concerned with extending out (A) than trying to protect the corner.  Allowing white to play there himself will give him the chance to strengthen his outside position, significantly reducing your ability to harass his groups.]
;W[en];B[do]
(;W[fp]LB[em:A]C[spice:  But I didn't think white would go here.

Jon:  I'm guessing he's trying to push harder to make up for what he lost on the right side.  If this weren't an issue, I'd play more solidly and connect at A.  Regardless, he's created a thin position, and I'm more than happy to challenge him by cutting at A.]
;B[fq]LB[em:A]C[Jon:  This is pretty passive, so I'd like to use my suggestion from earlier and cut at A.  White's going to have a hard time trying to manage both the left side group and a possible continued threat on the bottom center group.  You also have to worry about this exchange indirectly weakening your bottom group.]
;W[gq];B[eq];W[gp]C[Jon:  The exchange helped white strengthen on the outside, but also puts indirect pressure on your bottom group, which I was concerned about at move 104.]
;B[or]LB[nr:A]C[Jon:  This doesn't shut off the cut, so I would play A instead.]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[ks];W[nr];B[hr];W[cm];B[em]
LB[cf:A]TR[jf][jh][ji][kk][cm][dm][cn]C[spice:  This and the invasion of the 3-3 on the top left were experiments, but I don't think they're good. I just feel that, but what would be a better way to play? It wasn't easy to find a good alternative quickly.

Jon:  Now that white's position is strengthened, the cut doesn't do as much, so I'd prefer to immediately start attacking the top left area with an approach to A.  I'm aware it plays into a pincer with the support of the marked white stones, but it doesn't bother me that much because your marked stones in the center will make it easier to facilitate a reduction or invasion if necessary.  Also, for reference, experimentation is good, and I encourage it.]
;W[el];B[cc]LB[cf:A]C[Jon:  In regards to choosing between the 3-3 invasion and the approach at A, I don't think the 3-3 is as good.  White's more likely to stage a comeback by building up outside influence towards the top or left sides (and subsequently expanding them), so the corner is of relatively small value in the overall scheme of things.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]C[spice:  I didn't remember the variations.

Jon:  Awkward...!  ^^\\]
(;B[ed]LB[bd:A]C[spice:  I think this yields a bad result for black.

Jon:  Yeah, this is a misstep.  Making this cut immediately negatively interacts with your ability to resist by making the hane at A.]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]LB[ed:B][ce:A]C[Jon:  This is where the negative interaction comes up.  Black can't cut at A now because it's dependent on threatening what would be the double atari at B.]
;W[df];B[db];W[gr];B[es];W[ql];B[pk];W[jg];B[gh]LB[bf:B][ei:A]
C[Jon:  This is pretty cautious, and I'm afraid it'll allow white to secure a larger left side.  I'm confident you can push a bit harder (e.g. A), and you also have the clamp at B for poking down from above.]
;W[fh]C[Jon:  This was what I was afraid of - white engaging to naturally force him to close off the center opening.]
;B[gg]LB[fi:A]C[Jon:  This is also pretty timid.  I don't want to allow white to get the push down to A, so I'd like to hane there myself and create some resistance.]
;W[fi];B[ge];W[rm];B[sk];W[qp];B[rn];W[rp]LB[gi:A]C[Jon:  The corner's relatively small at the moment, so I'd rather push to close off the center by turning at A.]

(;W[ee];B[ff];W[dg];B[eh];W[di]
(;B[dh]C[Jon:  This push doesn't do much directly, so it's better to leave the threat of it open and force white to play around it.]

;B[gd]LB[ah:C][hk:A][am:D][ns:B]C[spice:  White resigned but isn't the game close enough to not resign? I must've done something wrong along the way and I hope you will point out mistakes to me. ;D

Jon:  No, you're in control of the game, and have a roughly 23-25 point lead at this point.  Another issue is that the endgame favors you - your options are much better than what white has.  Besides causing trouble with the current move, you have productive plays at A-D.

This concludes the review.  Thanks for reading!])
(;B[gj]C[spice:  Bigger I think. I intended the sagari to be forcing.

Jon:  I was originally leaning towards the sagari in terms of preference, but white can just block, and the follow-up isn't too exciting (just a first line hane that's reverse sente).  Ergo, I'm fine with this.]

(;B[bd];W[be];B[ce];W[ed];B[bf];W[bc];B[ae];W[bb]C[Jon:  This is the basic variation for black's resistance.]
;B[ee]LB[ci:A]TR[jf]C[Jon:  This was suggested, but I'm not as worried about white trying to expand the top side with black's marked stone in place.  I'd rather try to extend down the left side (A) and prevent white from extending up there himself.]

(;W[cm];B[fq]LB[em:B][fp:A]C[spice:  I expected this.

Jon:  I'd like to play this move one line higher (A) to maximize your territory and maintain a little bit of extra pressure on the white stones above.  This result is generally what I'd expect if white weren't feeling pressured from the deficit though (this or white connecting on the other side at B).]
;W[di]LB[co:A]C[Jon:  This demonstrates why I wasn't happy with the drop down to A.]

[pq]C[spice:  If not here, then where should black play?

Jon:  I'd start working on the bottom left, and like the slide to A.  The marked white group isn't out of danger yet, and you can use this move to gently pressure it while attacking white's approach stone.]

(;W[nq]C[spice:  I was thinking here.

Jon:  It's a very strong defense, but pretty small and low impact in the overall scheme of things.  This is why I was thinking of attaching at R-4, to do a bit more than just defend.]
;B[hq];W[dd]LB[hq:2][nq:1]C[spice:  He still gets the corner.
