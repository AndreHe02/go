POST GAME CONVERSATION:

*evan*:  your strategy is good

*amodeo* Thanks

*amodeo* I make too many reading mistakes, I think

*evan*:  i think your main problem is that you're scared of me

*evan*:  you shy away when i cut and basically give me what i want

*amodeo* I didn't realize I was doing that

*amodeo* Could be just bad reading, not realizing I could get away with a
more agressive response

*evan*:  well, you probably couldn't :) but it's a good idea to try

*amodeo* Except I used to lose lots of games by being foolhardy that way

*amodeo* Question of learning the right balance, I guess. I am probably too
cautious now]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[evan-amodeo(B) IGS]RE[W+63.5]PW

 amodeo 29k*: B3 was interesting

 evan 5k*: it's joseki, kinda

 evan 5k*: based on the assumption that i'll be able to nullify your
thickness ;)

 amodeo 29k*: I thought B4 was more usual

 evan 5k*: b4 is gote

 amodeo 29k*: I never thought it was!



<JL> I don't know why b4 is gote - but one idea is shown in the previous
variation.];B[fp];W[fr];B[bp];W[fc];B[df];W[fe];B[ec]C[Remember, contact fights strengthen weak  stones (esp. W's.  Try D17

work better than h15.  W still has f13 to threaten d12, and l18 and e18 to
establish a base. I'd play k18 to keep w from cutting under, then if he
invades at r17, i'd take the territory and build center influence <JL>]
