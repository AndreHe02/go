C[Dear reviewer, this is a game I recently played on the internet. It was actually a little weird as my oppoent (White) escaped at the point where the game record ends and even deleted the account. I made a rather big mistake in the beginning and thought about resigning right away, but the game developed into an interesting one. I assume that White is still a bit ahead in the end, but there are some uncertainties. So I'm looking for hints on first (1) how I could have avoided the big mistake in the beginning, second it's usually I who goes for influence, but here I have a game where I have to neutralize the opponent's influence (2), so any hint would be appreciated. Finally, in general I think my fighting and middle game (3) is my weak point, so any advice there is also very welcome.

Hi, I am Dieter, 2D in Belgium. I'll answer your questions (numbered 1-3), addressing the last one by analyzing the chase of the big black group at the bottom.

I wouldn't care too much about your opponent's escape as it was by all appearances a kid. Kids are usually tactically strong but strategically weak and escaping and deleting his account looks like something a kid would do.

I apologize for the poor format of the review. Usually I include some variations and marked stones or spots but my usual editor was down, so I resolved to "goban" which I do not master very well.]
;B[pd]C[facua111: hi];W[pp]C[DorianGray [1k?\]: Hi, have a nice game!]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[qn];W[nq];B[jd];W[cf];B[ch]C[Dieter: you like to play an influence game. If you don't like the pattern that followed, you could also play a high pincer here (D12 or D11), which emphasizes influence.]
;W[ef]C[Dieter: White's choice here is problematic. This joseki can be part of a standard opening pattern when White has the two options of pressuring the top or the left side group. However, your stone at K16 removes the first option.

I think professionals would jump into the corner here.

Not that this is all deciding, but you get the advantage now:]
;B[fd];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[dh];W[eh];B[cj];W[dk];B[cl];W[dl]
C[Dieter: this is a joseki mistake by White, who should jump to E7 instead.

But anyhow, White has a problem. He must make sense with his influence but doesn't have time to do so.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cn]C[Can / Should I hane here?

Dieter: No. The pushing is in your favour. You get easy territory and sente. A hane would invite a cut and fight. There's no interest for you in a fight in white's sphere of influence.]
;W[eo]C[Dieter: technically this is all very well by White but you have made easy territory on the left and ...]
;B[iq]C[Dieter ... use your sente in the greatest of fashions. White's influence is erased at the bottom and the K16 stone prevents sharp play at the top.

1. If the game becomes favourable for you in a natural way, you shouldn't worry at all about not playing your usual style. Indeed, White has chosen influence here and you take the territory at the left. But you have nothing to complain about and a player should always be able to adapt to the circumstances. You've done fine!]
;W[gq];B[lq]C[So far I think the game is not bad for me.

Dieter: fully agree. Your flow is natural. White's stones have a lot of work to do.]
;W[qo];B[pn]LB[pj:A]C[Maybe just A instead?

Dieter: Yes, that is probably a better idea. You will need all the space at the bottom for your two stones. These two stones are heavy and White may now stage a splitting attack.]
;W[qj];B[mn]C[Is this too vague or ok?

Dieter: The black structure is very thin indeed. I think I would attach against the corner to gain some strength with a move like P4 or O4. But I'm not sure what's best.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qq]LB[qh:A]C[I thought the previous White move was a little unreasonable and tried to take the initiative before White settle his two groups. So I was between this and A. Well, unfortuantely it turned into a disaster :-).

Dieter: I think that you found a very creative way here to deal with the uncertainty at the bottom. Your sente is well judged. If you just look at the numbers, it's 5 against 3 in the lower right. I like your move a lot. It cannot be bad.]
;W[rp]C[Dieter: Moves like these make me unsure. Is this a kid?]
;B[or];W[nr];B[oq];W[op];B[np]C[I though I'd be ok and it is White who is in trouble...

Dieter: And I do think White is in trouble ...];W[mp];B[no]
;W[mq];B[rq];W[rn];B[lp]C[Dieter: the problem is of course this move, because you did not see the ladder. Now how to prevent that?

2. I'm a bad example when it comes to tactical errors, so let this be advice for both of us.

The situation in the bottom right is very hot. You have played very sharply, taking the initiative where White was strong to start with. If it works, it's a knock out, if it doesn't, it may be disaster. This should trigger caution. And caution can trigger careful reading.

So, where would you play instead, now that you know there is a ladder? How to break the ladder while threatening something else and what will be the exchange?

(tactical exercise, feel free to mail me the answer)];W[mo]
;B[lo];W[nn];B[oo];W[on]C[Now I saw that it's a ladder...

Dieter: Yes, very painful. It is very hard to avoid these tactical mistakes but my previous explanation may help to get you in the proper mental condition to read carefully.]
;B[ns];W[po];B[mr];W[lr]C[That didn't really work either. Actually I calculated it, but played it nonetheless...

Dieter: Yeah :) that happens when we're taking a loss.];B[pq]
;W[ms]C[I was seriously thinking about resigning, but decided to continue a little bit...]
;B[rs];W[kq]C[Dieter: not resigning shows a good attitude here. You should give yourself time to recover mentally and calculate the situation. If we always resign after a local loss, we shouldn't play go.

So, well done.

And ... White already plays a slow move. Clearly he should swallow those stones on a large scale, at J5 or even something like M10.]
;B[jp]C[Dieter: but you make a big mistake here too. 

3. These stones are dead weight. There is absolutely no sense in rescueing them.

You should instead think about reducing the gigantic white framework, in the centre K10, or by capping the right side Q13, or look for sabaki tactics at C3-E3 ...]
;W[ln]C[Dieter: White too thinks on a small scale. Both players now confirm each others' thinking.]
;B[jn];W[io];B[jo]C[Dieter: By now I am sure you can see how terribly heavy this is.]
;W[hp]C[Dieter: White should cap.];B[jl]C[Dieter: good];W[km]
;B[in]C[Dieter: good];W[hn];B[go];W[ho];B[hl]C[Dieter: the shape is good.You already have an eye in sente with L6-L4, so the situation is not that bad.]
;W[kl];B[ph]C[Instead of invading I now thought that reducing the White influence was more important, so I played this one.

Dieter: Your dragon has one eye but there is no clear way to make a second one. Therefore I would jump out of trouble at K10 without hesitation.

On the other hand, you probably need to overplay like this to come back.]
;W[of];B[pj];W[qi];B[nh];W[qh]C[Dieter: White is too mild. He's not putting his strength to use. He should continue to cut you into pieces at N14, setting up a splitting attack at K10.]
;B[nf]C[I was quite happy with this move.

Dieter: agree];W[ne];B[oe];W[ng];B[og];W[mf];B[pf];W[mh];B[ni]
C[This sequence seemed like a success for me, maybe White could have done better.

Dieter: locally perhaps, but ...];W[jk]C[Dieter: ... the extra influence now helps White to kill the black dragon. However he continues to do so by playing too close to the attacked group, allowing you to strengthen it.]
;B[il];W[kj];B[nf]C[Dieter: I must say I do not understand this move and the next one. To me there is only H10 on the board.]
;W[mg]C[Dieter: If White plays H10 instead, the black group is completely enclosed and I see no way to make a second eye.]
;B[ij];W[ik]C[Dieter: again, too tightly attacked by White.]
;B[hk];W[hj];B[gj];W[hi];B[fk]C[Dieter: Your shape is getting better and better. Black is almost alive now.]
;W[gm]C[Dieter: I think White should simply surround and connect. Even if Black lives inside, the outward influence will be good.]
;B[gi];W[gh];B[hh];W[ii];B[fh];W[gl]C[Perfect timing on White's part. I was not so afraid of the group, but this move hit me hard.

Dieter: It does not really matter, since you are out.];B[gk]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[ff]LB[fi:A]C[Maybe White could have cut at A?

Dieter: it does not work anymore now, because of the ladder at G14 and the atari at J12.]
;B[fi];W[gf];B[eg];W[hd]C[Dieter: Very flexible play by White. The problem however is that through your connection, the whole bottom left has become weaker.]
;B[he];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[ie]
;B[dc];W[dg]C[Again good timing by White...

Dieter: Yes. It is almost suspicious.];B[ei];W[jc];B[gb];W[jb]
;B[eb];W[hb];B[fb];W[ib];B[gc];W[kd]TR[jd]C[I didn't really see a possiblity to move the marked stone.]
;B[qg];W[qc];B[rg]LB[pc:A]C[Maybe I should have answered at A, but it seemed so tempting :-).]
;W[ob];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl];W[ql];B[pk];W[sj];B[qm];W[sl];B[pl]
;W[rm]C[Not exactly a mega-success, but ok.];B[pc];W[pb];B[mi]
;W[li];B[ge];W[if]C[Was this exchange bad for me?

Dieter: It's a good sente but you can wonder if it needed to be played now. It loses ko threats.]
;B[cq]C[Dieter: Good!];W[bq];B[dp];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr];B[do]LB[bp:A]
TR[di][dj][dk][dl][dm]C[Here White escaped. It seems unclear, whether White is still leading. Was this last move ok or would A have been better? I was aiming at the marked stones and entering the bottom, but saving the corner is obviously big as well. Anyway, thanks in advance for your comments!

Dieter: As said, I suspect it was a fast improving kid who became bored or needed to quit for dinner.

The game actually looks better for Black, although the right side may be surprisingly void of eyes. R15 looks urgent.

Conclusion:

1. You cannot decide to take influence if the opponent wants to have it too. Be happy with territory if you get it for a bargain.

2. When the situation feels like an all or nothing fight, make sure to read carefully, otherwise, sacrifice what you can afford.

3. Don't make a dead group even fatter.

4. Your invasion at C3 was a great stage of a comeback.])
