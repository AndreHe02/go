KM[0.5];B[oc];W[pp];B[dd];W[cq];B[pe];W[dj];B[df];W[qj];B[qh]C[This is probably not the   best move.  Your corner is not really secured by it, and getting some action
started against white is urgent.];W[ep];B[qn];W[np];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W
[pq];B[qo];W[rq];B[sq];W[qr];B[rr]M[ro]C[Squeezing into the corner like this isn't a good idea.  It's only a few  points, and it's gote.  Even if white responds,
you have to protect the
marked connection.    You would be much better off if you extetended toward white's isolated stone.]

(;W[jq]C[this is not white's
best move.  White
should fill and attack
as in the variation.];B[pl];W[oj];B[oh];W[ic]C[Good choice for white.
There are so many ways
to continue from here,
there should be virtually no  chance of a significant
sized black territory  being developed on the
top.];B[mi]M[kc]C[It's unlikely that black can
catch the white stones by chasing them directly, and in the process
black isn't  building any territory.

Something like the triangle would
be better, to build territory and
put pressure on the white invader.];W[nk];B[oo]C[given your apparent intent to chase
the white stones, its a good idea to
strengthen your corner group
like this.];W[op];B[nm];W[lk];B[lm];W[fc];B[ec]M[dc]C[here again, your  corner is still open.
The marked position would be better.];W[fd];B[kc];W[ch]C[this is really too slow for white.  It's much more
urgent (and profitable) to erase black's potential
territory in the upper right quadrant.];B[cg];W[dh];B[ki];W[jk];B[lp];W
[lq];B[mp];W[mq]C[this is very good for  white, so black
shouldn't have forced him to do it.
This would be forgivable if black's  position were also secured by it,  but that is far from the case.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[pk];W[pj];B[kl];W[kk];B[im]M[ji]C[white's wall is so strong  (with black's help) he
should attack, not flee.];W[hk]C[white is playing too passively in his  escape.]
;B[ii];W[ie];B[ik];W[ij];B[il];W[ji];B[jh];W[jj];B[ig];W[hj]M[hi]C[white missed a bet here.  the
marked position would be better,
and white needs to continue by
extending his top group into the
black territory being formed.   black really gets more than he deserves in the next sequence.]

that white should have played here  at move 222 instead of where he
did.  Still, I think white is OK if
he just connects, and allowing black
to cut is really begging for trouble.];W[is];B[hs];W[gs];B[nq]C[I think white has too many outside
libterties for black to kill directly,
but its a good fight.  Black should try
to concentrate on leaving a "one eyed"
shape when he is captured.];W[af];B[ae];W[ag];B[ns];W[ms];B[mr];W[or]C[at  some point, it becomes clear that
black won't win.  At that point, black
should stop persuing it.  All these

C[That's it.   Although black wins handily, white
actually played a far better game, except for the
fabulously large moyo he permitted black.  White
should have erased this, strategically by playing
against it sooner, or even tactically at a much
later stage.];B[tt])

chased.]))
