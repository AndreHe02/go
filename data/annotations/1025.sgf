C[Hi Michael.  My comments will be prefixed by "DS:"   I will try to give you the best comments I can, but I realize a stronger player may think otherwise :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi]C[DS: Low Chinese opening for B.  This stresses both influence building and territory. The power of this opening is in creating influence and then using that influence to control the game.]
;W[dj]LB[kd:a][jd:b][nq:c]C[DS: other moves for W are 'a', 'b', and 'c'.]
;B[jd]LB[fc:a]C[DS: This is a safe, calm move.  B more frequently plays 'a' as it is both an approach move and an extension from Q17, while K16 is only an extension.  Whenever possible, choose moves with more than one purpose.]
;W[nq]LB[pe:a]C[DS: Ok, but once B plays K16, W almost has to move at Q15.]

(;B[pn]LB[lq:a][jp:b]C[DS:  Standard, however, consider a pincer at M3 or K4.  Once again, these moves are muti-purpose.  With B's presence at the top, B shouldn't fear a double approach move in the lower right. See the variation for one possibility.]
;W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[DS: again standard, but B is just following W. See variation again...]
;W[kp]C[DS: non standard.  L3 is calmer.  L4 opens the door for B to invade.]
;B[qe]LB[pe:a]C[DS: too concentrated on the right.  W's stones are more spread out and seems to be developing faster. Actually, with the stone at K16, playing at 'a' would be more consistent.]
;W[hp]C[so far so good

DS: well... W would have been better at k10.  H4 too slow.  B too cramped.]
;B[cq]C[DS:  Ok, proper timing, however, while this does wrest the corner from W, W's wall is VERY powerful now.]

(;W[dq]C[DS: Wrong direction, i think.  W has too many stones at the bottom already.  A wall the other way would be more efficient.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
;B[jj]C[still looks good for black

DS: ok, this is a double purpose move. Expands B's moyo while limiting W's. B is ahead now.]
;W[dg]C[DS: bad move.];B[fc]C[DS: good move.];W[ec]C[DS: Very bad move. this just helps B.]
;B[fd]LB[cc:a]C[DS: B now has ideal shape at the top, and can still invade at 'a'.]
;W[mc]C[DS: Very dangerous invasion.]
(;B[kc]C[DS: I would prefer O16 and press W against the top.  Even if W lives, the outward influence in conjunction with all  the rest of B's stones would be hard to beat.]
;W[me]C[DS: If W lives now, B's moyo is destroyed.]
(;B[jf]C[DS: wrong direction. also it puts little pressure on W.]
;W[hd]
(;B[ff]LB[ge:a][he:b]C[DS: Bad move. W is outnumbered 6 to 1 here.  Time to fight for yourself.  'a' and 'b' are all viable options.]
;W[hf];B[fh];W[fg]C[DS: Bad move.];B[gg];W[eg]
(;B[gf]C[DS: Bad move. weak.];W[gh]
(;B[he]C[DS: ?? why not just J13?];W[fi];B[hh];W[gi];B[if];W[hi]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[ji]C[DS: W has created a nice wall now facing the bottom thickness.]
;W[hl];B[mo]C[DS: Ok, but the W's stones at the top still have aji. (bad potential for B)]
;W[oo];B[np]C[DS: bad move. Just P6 is ok.];W[op];B[on];W[no]
;B[nn];W[mp];B[oq]C[DS: Doesn't work];W[np]C[DS: ??W should have cut at Q3.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[lp];W[po];B[qo];W[lo];B[ln]C[DS: Bad move. B can only connect at N6.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ko];B[kl];W[lm];B[mo];W[kn];B[mn];W[km];B[ll]
;W[jl]C[DS: This just helped W finalize the territory at the bottom/center. B looks good yet as long as W's stones at the top don't move. :)]
;B[lq]C[DS: doesn't work.];W[mr];B[mq]C[DS: Nonsense.];W[nr]
;B[kr];W[kq];B[lj]C[DS: Small move. N13 would be better. (double purpose again.)]
;W[ml]
(;B[nl]C[DS: Bad move. wrong direction.  see other variation.]
;W[mk]
(;B[nj]C[DS: This is an attempt at a net, but it leaves too many cutting points in B's shape.]

;B[jg];W[li];B[lf];W[kj];B[jk];W[ki]C[DS: not needed by W.  W had second eye at R17 or N18.]

(;B[cc]C[DS: ok, but I think J8 much more urgent. Invade the larger moyo first. C17 seems smaller to me.]
;W[cd]C[DS: correct. The left side is huge.]
(;B[bd]C[DS: Bad move. E18 the only move.];W[be]C[White lives and I have alot of weak points

;W[im];B[ik];W[gk];B[lr]C[DS: Very bad move. You should keep up the momentum with your invasion into W's territory. This group is dead no matter what.]

;W[rr];B[sq]C[DS: Bad move R6 or S6 the only way.];W[qn]C[DS: B short of liberties, but see variation.]

;B[bl];W[tt];B[fn]C[DS: Nonsense. you are just giving W points.]
;W[tt];B[en]C[DS: ditto.];W[gs];B[hr];C[DS: I think you have the general idea, but you need work on simple tesuji and life and death. This will also teach you to read better and get stronger too. You had a won game until losing that group at the bottom right.  Don't feel bad, I've lost many "won" games  the same way. Just learn from your mistakes.]
