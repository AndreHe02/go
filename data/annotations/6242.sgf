C[Hi!
Thanks for reviewing my game!
I played black in this game,  and lost with a few points. I'd like to ask you to comment for both sizes, point on my major mistakes, and give some advise on how can I improve my play.

Thanks again,
mondik.

Hello!  This is Mengqi Yang.  I will be reviewing your game this time.  One thing I've definitely noticed in this game was that white gave way too much thickness to black in the beginning of the game for not much profit.  

I would say black could've had a comfortable win, but black tried too hard to kill things which shouldn't be killable.  

The key of this game is attacking and profiting, not killing.  Killing is hard, and usually you will fail unless you're extremely strong all around.  If not, you'll just have rotten shape when your opponent gets out, like if you play out a broken ladder.

So let's begin the review.];B[pd]C[J];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[eq]

(;W[jq]C[W8 is not a very good move.  It allows the corner stone to become surrounded, which is extremely bad.  Don't worry about your pincer stone just yet, and if you do have worries after black jumps out, perhaps you should've just played something other than a pincer.]

(;W[qc]C[This move is much too early.  There are also better ways to invade this.  Look at the other ways and see that all of them involve going outside.  This is because being hemmed in like white did is extremely bad.

When there are still big points out there like the K16 area, don't invade just yet.]

C[Mondik, your problem is that you try to kill things too much, as I have said, which leads to you getting this very overextended and thin shape.  If you want to attack, attack from a distance so that your stones wouldn't be as thin.  And please read out sequences to see if they work.

One major thing you need to do is to learn how to use thickness.  White gave you tons of thickness in the beginning, the lower left and upper right in particular, but you couldn't use them to their fullest effect.  As the game went on, the thickness in the upper right only got you a few measily points, the thickness in the lower left even less so.

Concentrate on improving your middle game, on how to attack in particular as I have said.  Push your opponents towards your thickness.  Once you have learned how to attack, you will go far.
