C[Hi, I'm Niko Koester from Germany. I'm currently ranked 6 kyu on KGS.

I'll focus my criticisms on the black side, but also point out the most obvious errors white makes. I may sound harsh at times, but that is only to make my point as clear as possible.


Why did Black lose?

White did make several mistakes in the opening, which Black was not able to punnish.  At several points in the game Black did not took the biggest points on the bord. As White did not see those points either they have been taken at random, creating a balanced game in the end. Black built a weak group on the left side which was luckily for him not attacked by white.

What should Black learn from this game?

When searching for big points, one should search in the following order:
corner, side, center

A good way to play more solidly is to follow the questions below in this order:

1) Do I have a weak group? If so, support it!
2) Do my opponent have a weak group? If so put pressure on it.
3) Look for big points: In the corners, at the side, in the center

2 does not mean that you should try to kill it. Just increase the pressure and get the profit for that somwhere else. (see var. at S9)

If you have any more questions, feel free to contact me. I hope this review will help you to become stronger.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pp]LB[cp:A][pp:B]C[I want you to see the difference between the two white corners:
A can be secured with a singel move, where as B still leaves the corner open.
Compare the variations. I hope you see that it is more urgent to play at A.]

(;B[pj]LB[pk:C][ql:B][pm:A][rp:D]TR[qn]C[With this move you allow white to get a secure corner with D. (see var.) Compare the result in the variation to the variation starting from W6. 
Do you see the difference? In both cases white comes out in sente so why not take the corner and build a base for your own stones? Also, if white secures the corner with D you still have to come back and help you stones. 
Be aware, that this move does not enforce the triangle marked stone! This structure leaves a lot of possiblie invading points (A-C), which white might want to use later to put pressure on your group.]
(;W[qf]LB[ep:B][rp:A][eq:C]C[I don't like this move for white. A-C are bigger points in my oppinion.]
(;B[nc]LB[nd:A]TR[pj][qn]C[As you already have the marked stones A would put more pressure on the attacking stone. See the variation for black at A.]
;W[of]LB[rd:A][mf:C][ri:B]C[>What is the best response to this?
See variation at move 8.
>I decided to ignore it.
With ignoring it, you allow the group to get a base. First A in sente, then B or C.]
;B[dj]LB[ep:A][rp:C][eq:B]C[There are still several points with higher priority!
If you search for big points, always check corners, sides, center in this order.]

;B[qj]CR[qn]TR[qi][pj]C[This is a very bad shape for white! Also it fixes most of your problems in the corner. You were lucky!]

TR[mi]C[>Too defensive? Is there a bigger move here? I felt like I was in a very good spot here and wasn't sure what to do with it.
What do you think of triangle as an alternative? It secures the cut  and also builds a wall. But now defending the cut is a must.
But of course there are still several big points as mentioned before. (A-E) Where E has a much lower priority than A-D.]
;W[cf]C[White is building another week group and does not take one of the big points, good for you!]
;B[fc]LB[fd:A][ch:B]TR[nc][pd][dj]C[Playing at A would work better with the marked stones:
- The top side is improtant and you already have stones at the other corner -> Play at 4. line
- The stone is already slightly pincered Playing at A increases the pressure on the stone
Maybe a low pincer at B would  also be good here.];W[ci]C[Again, white is asking to make bad shape....]
;B[cj]C[...and gets it.];W[di]
(;B[el]LB[ej:A][fj:B][fk:C][cn:D]TR[ei]C[>I don't remember why I played this. It looks odd, but I guess I wanted a move for both the bottom and the side. I also considered the hane at E11 or >attacking the corner at E4.

This move looks better than it is. It tries to to two things at once, but its neither fish nor fowl.
As white attached on one of you stones and pushed from behind your first instinct should be playing at A, B or C.
If you make a base e.g. at D white can play at the marked point and all of a sudden it looks like you were pusing from behind... (which is bad)]
;W[cm]TR[el]C[Now your base is gone and you are the one with the week group. Also your marked stone does not do much to help them.
Also the keima cut is really serious now! See variation after next move.
Read commentary at move 27 before viewing at the variation.]
;B[jj]LB[bd:E][rd:D][ep:B][rp:A][eq:C]TR[cj][dj][el]C[>I like the center.
Good for you, but at this point this is a really bad move. I want to help you to see this.
If you look for big points, as I said before use the corner, side, center priority.
A-E are ~15 points (or even more) cash in your hand. Yes, 15P each!
Also you have a weak group (marked), wich is like +15P for your opponent.
Your move, does make any secure points, and you dont know if it will ever does. Also it does not help your weak group. 
Compared to what is improtant right now, this move is like passing and let white play several big points in a row in sente.
See variations at moves 24 and 27 and compare the score estimations: the estimated difference is 60! points.]
(;W[gj];B[ep]TR[cj][dj][el]C[This move does not help the weak group.  But of couse attacking the corner is important.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp]LB[fp:A]C[I would prefer a solid connection at A. With this move white has some forcing moves you don't like, as they attack the stones on the side. See var.]
(;W[jq];B[dn]LB[ek:B][en:A]TR[el][ep]C[It is good that you wanted to save your stones at the side. Though I prefer A, the 2 keima are much more vulnerable than 2 one-space-jumps.]

>I settled on O15, but I don't feel great about it.
Right, and it is good you see this. I numbered you favourite spots. Let us look how much points these spots gain.

1 - ~ 6p
2 - ~ 2p
3 - ~ 2p
4 - any?
5 - good idea but white already has a foot in your territory
6 - maybe 6P?

compare this with A-C which give you ~15P. A even in sente...

At this point the game is more or less balanced, so the one who gets the big points will probably win the game.]

It is a good reflex to answer such a (bad) peep with a solid connection. But this peep threatens to cut three strong groups.
So I guess your move is fine.];W[qq];B[po]LB[on:A][rq:B]C[Attaching to enemy stones usually gives you bad shape. A or B looks better.]
