C[Hi! Thanks in advance very much for reviewing my game. Feel free to say whatever you like about the play. I have added some specific questions in the comments.

WTS [4k\]: hi, have a good game
rakuyou73 [4k\]: hi];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[nc]C[is this a good approach to the Chinese? I liked it because it disturbs his formation on the top. But my extension to L17 is not optimal. But I could make nice use of the aji in the corner later.

[BB\] From a theory perspective, this is the wrong side to attack from. J17 is a low stone, so less interesting/relevant. Q4 is a high stone, so more interesting/relevant. The right side has more open spaces, the top is more confined.

Consider q14 instead. Black should play a squeeze on the right side (the more interesting/relevant side, and so as not to be giving you 2/3 of the board). But there is an abundance of space for you to make life yet.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc];B[ie]C[[BB\] Yes, this is good for Black.]
;W[jd]C[is this kakari helping black too much? I wanted the freedom towards the center.

[BB\] Yes. More importantly, what does it achieve for you? It creates thickness for Black, but not for you.]
;B[id];W[kf];B[ec];W[dj]C[I was happy with this position as white.

[BB\] Black's E17 is wrong. He should play something like D10 instead. With Black at D10, White has no simple attack on the corner.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[qi];W[ol];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[rm];W[pn]
C[[BB\] Here is where you start to go wrong. This move is not sente, and not big.]
;B[rl];W[qk]C[[BB\] This move is not sente, and really small.]
;B[rk];W[qj]C[[BB\] And so on. Both players are wrong to keep playing here.]
;B[rj];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi];B[jq]C[[BB\] Black is the first to realise he's free to play elsewhere, and uses it to great effect.]
;W[jo]C[aiming towards the center here

[BB\] With the center still open from the top, and with weakness at the right near o13 and q7, you will never get central territory in this game.]
;B[gq];W[jp];B[lq]C[[BB\] Black should just play l3. How is k4/l3 a good exchange for you? But you got kucky with a mistake from Black here.]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hq];W[kq]C[[BB\] You're really lucky to get this. Now you are ahead. The bottom left is weak (barely even yours), but so is g3 etc.]
;B[gn];W[fo]C[I often play kakaris like this, but also often wonder whether they do not strengthen my opponent too much. But here I think it helps to make him heavy.

[BB\] This achieves nothing but strengthening Black.];B[go]
;W[fp];B[ho];W[im]C[happy to attack here

[BB\] It's okay, but a better attack is e2. Attack his group while strengthening yours. Get territory. Make him run away. And as he runs away, make territory with moves like j7.]
;B[gl]C[[BB\] Black should play d2.];W[fm];B[gm]C[[BB\] This isn't a good exchange for you.]
;W[dm]C[rakuyou73 [4k\]: thx
WTS [4k\]: ok]
(;B[hk]C[[BB\] Black should be playing d2.];W[jk];B[ek]C[[BB\] This is a bad exchange for Black.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[di];B[cq]C[With C4 I would take more territory, but lose my opportunity to attack. I thought I still had some good attacking moves so played D3.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[an];B[ap];W[ar];B[br];W[bs];B[cs];W[am];B[aq];W[ii];B[gi]
;W[hg];B[cg]C[This is a big move that I wanted to have played myself, but now black lets me attempt to kill his group. I don't succeed, so it works out well for black, but to me it feels like black is taking a big risk here. Could I have killed his group..?]
;W[fh];B[fr];W[fq];B[es];W[gr];B[eq];W[hr];B[en];W[fn];B[fl]
C[maybe E7 would have been better here.

[BB\] Honestly, I don't know. Yes, it would be better if you need to kill Black here to win, but it may or may not achieve that. I've included one variation where Black lives, as an example. But equally likely, Black will break out and the fight will continue.

Here's some general advice. Don't rely on being able to kill a group, unless you are sure you can kill it. When Black plays a move like c13 (ignoring his weak group), you should not be surprised. You should be confident that you could kill the group, and happy to demonstrate your superior reading skills by doing so.

**OR** you should know that while attacking the group, you will gain more than c13 was worth (In this case, that would mean thickness in sente, and the freedom to make a big move elsewhere - o13 perhaps?). 

**OR** you should have played c13 yourself, and accept that Black's group was already alive.

You see, good players don't generally go for the kill. They attack, in a way that gains territory even when it doesn't kill. It's okay to play an attacking move that eventually lets the group live (at a cost to your opponent, in thickness and/or territory) and later find out that you could have in fact killed the group by launching an all-out attack. If you can't see the kill in advance, don't jump in desperately trying unless you really are that desperate. And don't assume your opponent will make an extra move to be sure of life, if you're not sure you can kill them if they don't.

This is how good players play.]

(;W[gc]C[I got a bit angry and wanted to invade. Maybe it's a bit of an overplay. I guess calmly reducing would have sufficed since I was ahead.

[BB\] Yes, you should recognise when you're ahead, and remind yourself not to be hotheaded. I think my preference is probably o13 at this point. Black still needs a move to protect the top left. White may even have real invasions leading to at least ko such as starting with b16.

;W[tt]C[WTS [4k\]: thanks for the game
rakuyou73 [4k\]: thx

[BB\] Major notes:
- You won because you got territory in the middle. You got territory in the middle because black played m3, which died, not l3, which would have lived. If Black had played l3 (you will have to take my word for this) you would not have ended up with any territory in the center, and assuming no blunders, you would not have won.
- You have the wrong approach to attacking weak groups. Work on making territory (or at least influence) while attacking. Don't assume you can kill, i.e. that your opponent must defend, unless you can be sure. In the mean time, making attacking moves that make you profit, while being sure that if they are ignored, you can follow up with a kill or a cut (a partial kill, or creating two weak groups).
- Be aware of how much territory you have during the game. Know whether or not you need to make foolish moves (hint: you almost never do).
- Be cautious when playing kakaris. Be sure they help you more than they help the opponent. If in doubt, don't play them, because they always reduce aji. Being sente, you are usually free to play them later.

Minor notes:
- This game is another example of the saying "if one player has all four corners, White wins".

If you have any questions, please do email me.

Otherwise, take these ideas, try them in other games, and having done so, find a game you lost where you think you applied them reasonably, and have that reviewed. That way, your next reviewer will be forced to come up with even more interesting things to say about how to play good go :) Good luck.]

[so][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[[BB\] Okay, let's see what the territory looks like. I'll mark what's clearly territory. It's a fairly common idea, and you should do it regularly when you review games, and even during live games. Time permitting.

How I do this is: I simply ask, for each point, assuming the other player has sente, is it possible for this point **not** to be territory at the end of the game? Otherwise, we have a point of certain territory.

Tallying this up, we have...

Black:
- 5 points bottom left
- 23 points top left
- 37 points right
- 2 in the middle
- 2 captures
for a total of 69 points

White:
- 13 on the left
- 69 in the center
- 2 captures
for a total of 84 points

It's worth noting that Black has sente, and looking at a move like Black g14, it could be worth about 8 points. But White would still be ahead.]
