Jewdan: Hi, I'm Jewdan, your reviewer. I will proceed all of my comments with "Jewdan: " as I did here.

I do not want to be discouraging or mean, so please understand that I am upset with your opponent and not you when I say this: this was a cruel game. You should not have played White, and you certainly should have taken at least two stones against your opponent. I can imagine that this was a terrible, humiliating game for you, and I hope that my review may be able to help you not only improve, but also settle some of the frustrations this game made you feel.

(Disclaimer: If I am completely misunderstanding the situation, sorry. I am incredibly presumptuous and leap to well-detailed conclusions from scant information. I mean no harm by this.)]
;B[pd];W[pq]CR[qp][dc]LB[po:A][qo:B][pn:C][qn:D]C[Jewdan: This move you played is the exact move Kajiwara-sensei used as an example in the chapter as a move where a pro might say, "Move two lost the game." Harsh criticism, but I aim to be constructive.

The reason this move is so bad is because Black wants nothing more than to play moves like A or B (A is probably better) in response to your komoku (3-4). The arrangement of your komoku like this means that Black can take an ideal extension from his upper-right hoshi (4-4) while eliminating your ideal extension. This is the concept of "direction of play," and is masterfully explained in Kajiwara Takeo's book _The Direction of Play_ (his name, written in Western order, is Takeo Kajiwara), and I encourage everybody I review to buy and read his book.

A quick, free synopsis of the concept is that stones can be seen as having wills and desires. Stones have moves that should naturally follow and can be seen to complete the original moves. By playing in a stone's direction of play like this, you satisfy the stone and put it to optimal use. By playing on an enemy's direction of play, you make his stone unhappy and make in unoptimal.

How does that apply here? The direction of play for a hoshi stone is a far extension along the sides, and the direction of play for the komoku is to make a shimari at A, B, C, or D. By playing like this, you invite Black to not only satisfy his stone's direction of play, but also to refute yours.

Now, this is not an irrecoverable mistake. There are lots of examples of pro games where this is the second move; however, solid theory shows that this move is questionable. In the future, a better point to pick if you would like to play a komoku would be at S4 or D17, both marked with circles.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[qo]CR[po]C[Jewdan: Note that, since the play in the upper-right is a hoshi, it is probably better for the kakari to be at Q5 (marked with a circle) to emphasize influence over territory.]
;W[cn]LB[op:A][np:B]C[how is my opening here?

Jewdan: Not too bad, despite my railing against your second move. However, Black has the opportunity to play at A or B to start mokuhazushi (3-5) joseki that will likely benefit him in the upper-right. This is not something I would personally allow, but this is probably a matter of personal preference as opposed to go theory.]
;B[cl]C[i don't know how to handle something like Black 7 after playing this kind of kakari. what's wrong with the way i'm handling things?

Jewdan: This hasami (pincer) is standard, though it may not be a good choice for Black here. The best response locally is C3; see the variation.]

(;W[op]C[Jewdan: You do have the freedom to leave, but realize that you can't do well in both corners. You have to pick one or the other...

(My advice: you probably don't want to leave after the pincer.)]
;B[qq]
(;W[en]LB[cq:A]C[Jewdan: There are a few problems with this move:

1) Black's last move was not standard joseki. If White responds to the mistake, White stands to profit a bit extra. If White does not respond, Black's mistake becomes a good move. White should almost certainly respond at R2; see the variation on this move.

2) In this situation, the best local move is jumping into the san-san (3-3) at A; one of the things Kajiwara-sensei does in _The Direction of Play_ is explain why this move should not be considered joseki. Black can crush White in a fight here.

3) Allowing Black to extend along the bottom in this corner will likely hurt your lower-right stones.

See the variation on this move to see what you probably should have done.]
;B[pr];W[or];B[pp];W[oq];B[qr];W[eq]CR[on]C[this move seems odd to me. i forgot exactly why i played here. i think it's because i either wanted a large side on the bottom or a corner.

Jewdan: It does seem odd; it may have been a misclick for F3? However, White has a bad position in the lower-right since Black stands to take influence in the center and right with the hane at A on top of the 10 moku he has in the corner. I believe that it is urgent to prevent that from happening at all costs, and P6 (marked) seems the best way to do this. Black will almost certainly reply with a joseki in the lower-left to try to approach as close as possible to your lower-right group, but that cannot be helped.]
;B[dq]
(;W[ep]LB[oo:A]C[Jewdan: I'm not certain this is the best line of play. Black is leading territorially, and though you make a large framework with this sequence, the sequence is gote, so Black can then take the large hane at A.

See the variation on this move for an interesting idea (though I cannot say that it really is better).]
;B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[jq];B[lq]C[what's the best way to handle something like Black 23 in this case?

Jewdan: This move is impertinent and greedy; it's an overplay. With absolutely no support, Black dove straight into the middle of your strength. The best way to handle this is to respond with strength; if you do so, you are almost guaranteed to get a better result than if he had not invaded in the first place.

I think you picked the best move, actually. I tried some other plays that my instincts led me to assume were better, but this play has the best result... if followed up correctly.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[lo];B[mq]
(;W[jo]CR[mp][mq][lq]C[Jewdan: Here is the mistake that allowed Black to get a good result. The L4 stone is nearly irrelevant to this fight; the focus is on the N3 group (marked). If you capture these stones, Black will have a hard time trying to save L4, and good play would lead him to let them die naturally while only threatening to save them.

See the variation for the correct response.];B[mo]LB[ln:A][mn:B]
[pi:C]C[i'm not sure how to save the four white stones on the bottom right (or if i should even bother saving them at all).

Jewdan: It is possible to try running with the stones, but that is more likely to hurt than help you. For now, it's probably best to trade M6 (A) for N6 (B) and then tenuki (play elsewhere), probably at Q11 (C). The stones will likely die naturally through this sequence, but leaving the aji (potential) to live is important.]
;W[oo];B[nn];W[pn];B[ko]LB[ln:A]C[Jewdan: Another greedy move. Black has little to gain by adding another group to worry about, and he actually endangers his important group by driving White out like this. He should play simply at M6 (A) to help his group out.]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[om];W[pm];B[km]LB[ll:A]C[there's definitely a better move somewhere. i just keep giving black points in the following sequence.

Jewdan: Allowing Black to capture the stones from the past few moves in unacceptable. You have to keep up the flow with M8 (A).

Now, don't expect to capture either of the groups at this point, but you can expect that Black will not gain much for his efforts. It is true that both players have two weak groups, but White has two advantages:

1) "A weak group between two weak enemy groups is a strong group." Your splitting group gains strength from simultaneously attacking two groups, so it is not in much danger.

2) Your group on the right, in the process of the fight, will form a base naturally on the right side and live.

So, despite all the work Black has put in to destroy your territory, he will gain nothing for himself while destroying the right side where he was dominating.]
;W[ls]LB[ll:A]C[Jewdan: This is an unfortunate move. This tenuki not only gives Black your important cutting group, but fails in the only purpose I can see for it (trying to connect the right group out). M8 (A) is the only option here.]
;B[jp];W[iq];B[ll];W[mm]C[Jewdan: This move seems like a panicked response. There is nothing to be done to save these stones, so moving here is only giving him more points. If you want to continue playing, help out your lower-right group.]
;B[ml];W[ol];B[nm];W[pj]C[how do you feel about this move?

Jewdan: Fine, thanks for asking ;)

White needs to form a base with no risk of being cut, and the two-point jump/keima here works great. White's not out of the woods yet, but this helps the position.]
;B[ip];W[hq];B[ms]LB[nc:A][jd:B][fc:C]C[Jewdan: The sequence from this move to move 60 should not have been played by either side. Black plays endgame moves in the middle game, and White makes matters worse by responding to those moves. White should have left to kakari at O17 (A) in every move in this sequence, and Black should have played K16 (B) or F17 (C) for his moves.

It seems as though you were worried about connecting your lower-right group to your bottom group. Note that you failed to do so, and that there is no way for you to have succeeded. Despite this, the group lived just fine. This is proof that Black played poorly by playing in this sequence, and that you should have left.]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[ns];B[ks];W[nq];B[ps];W[os];B[rm];W[rl]LB[ql:A]
[qm:B][rk:C][rn:D][sl:E][pg:F]C[Jewdan: This tsuke (attachment) should only be played when Black cannot play the hane at R8 (A) due to a bad result. After Black 'A', White plays 'B', Black 'C', White 'D', and Black 'E'. If White's stone at 'D' were not at risk to be cut off, doing damage to Black's territory, or helping White live, then this result would be bad for Black. However, the stone is worthless, so Black can play the hane without hesitation.

I think that the best response is a move like Q13 (F). Black cannot cut White's shape, so White should concentrate on expanding his base.]

;B[oi];W[nk];B[qi]LB[rk:A][qk:B][qj:C][qm:D][pl:E][pk:F][ok:G]
[oj:H][nj:I][oi:J][nk:K][qi:L]C[Jewdan: The result of this sequence is bad for White. If Black had not messed up later in the game, Black would have successfully secured the right side. Rather than playing 'A', White should have connected with 'E' immediately to leave Black with less power with which to attack.]
;W[js]LB[lj:A][ni:B]C[Jewdan: It is best to save this move as a ko threat. Note that it is gote; after Black connects at L2, you need to connect at K2 at some point to prevent a disaster on the bottom. A play like M10 (A) or P11 (B) is desperately needed.]
;B[kr];W[jr]C[Jewdan: You cannot afford this move now. White's lower-right group is in desperate danger.]
;B[em]LB[mh:A]C[Jewdan: This is a weird move. Black should reflexively keep up the attack on White's group with N12 (A) and make a large moyo on the top. This move does not help Black locally or globally, so I can only call this a mistake.]
;W[hp]C[Jewdan: There is still nothing larger than running with your lower-right group.]
;B[io];W[li]LB[lj:A][ni:B]C[i'm not satisfied at all with this move. i guess i played it because i was panicking.

Jewdan: It's the right idea, though M10 or P11 might be better.]
;B[cf]C[how do you feel about the next 5 moves?

Jewdan: Move 84 was fine, 86 was too high, and 88 may be overextended.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fe]LB[fd:A][fc:B]C[Jewdan: The joseki is at A or B, and A is correct for this position.]
;B[nc];W[kc]LB[fd:A][jc:B]C[Jewdan: Even if 86 were at A, this move should probably only be at B. You played too close to Black's strength here.]
;B[hc]LB[fd:A][jc:B]C[i am thinking this is the result of white 88. what would be a better placement for white 88?

Jewdan: If 86 were at A and 88 at B, this move wouldn't be good. Unfortunately, you've given Black room to devestate your territory.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[fc];B[fb];W[eb];B[he];W[ge]LB[ke:A]C[i'm not sure what to do next here and during the following moves. i was basically just trying to reduce black as much as i could.

Jewdan: It seems best to play A to help out your lone White stone on the top and attack Black's group.]
;B[if];W[ii]LB[ji:A]C[i feel as though white 98 doesn't belong here. where is a better place?

Jewdan: K11 (A) is probably better. You're in the unfortunate situation of having to worry about two groups simultaneously, and it's important that you correctly pick which one is better. You had the right idea here.]
;B[ji];W[jh]LB[ki:A]C[Jewdan: This move makes living difficult. I would clamp with L11 (A) instead; try to read continuations.]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[lh];W[mh];B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[ni]LB[lj:A]C[Jewdan: This move should have been the death of your dragon. White does not even have an eye yet (there's a ko at the bottom of the board), and as Black shows with his next move, this move does not help make eyes. You should play at M10 (A) to start a sequence to live in sente.]
;B[lj];W[pi]C[Jewdan: This is the correct local move because White cannot make his dragon live (save for Black's mistakes). However, it is proper to resign when you are losing like this.]
;B[oh];W[qh];B[ph];W[ri];B[qg]LB[pf:A][of:B]C[in the next 15 or so moves, black gives up these four stones. was this the correct choice for black? suppose he did not intend to give up these four stones, how could white have played to ensure a lesser loss?

Jewdan: Black made a terrible mistake; White's dragon should die here. However, this hane enables White to capture the four stones. Black needed to play A or B to end the game, but he played another greedy move.]
;W[ne];B[md];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qe];W[qd];B[pc];W[qf];B[re]
;W[pg];B[og];W[pf];B[nf];W[mf];B[me];W[of]LB[rd:A]C[Jewdan: Black has been killed, so this move is an overplay. Playing S16 (A) captures more stones and causes further damage to Black's territory in the corner.]
;B[mi];W[ng];B[rd];W[di]C[given the situation on the left side, i feel as though this stone was poorly placed. where do you recommend i play white 136?

Jewdan: Right where you did. This is an excellent reducing move. You can't play any lower than this, nor can you play closer to the Black stones this move pressures.]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[ig];W[hi]LB[fh:A]C[Jewdan: Loosely connecting here with F12 (A) seems to be a better move.]

C[Jewdan: It is better to play at 'A' instead. While Black may hane at this point to reduce you, it is only reverse sente for him to do so. Meanwhile, you leave the opportunity open to play 'B' in sente. Dropping down like this is just gote.]

It's not enough to change the fact that you lost, of course, but it would be enough to swipe the smug look off of that bully's face.]

All I can say is, don't play people that are stronger than you as White. Though there is a lot of content in this game for you to look over and learn from, I feel that you would do better playing people closer in rank to you. A beating only causes bruises, and even if you learn to fight better because of it, the pain and shame still linger to cause you to flinch when a critical moment comes later.

Good luck with your future Go! If you try to work your way up steadily, you can probably play evenly with this guy in three to six months.]
