(;W[de]C[Ryan:
I wouldn't do this move, because it makes black's next move good. He's able to stabilize his C6 stone and attack your D15 stone at the same time.

See variations.];B[cg];W[cc];B[gc]C[Ryan:
Black's move here is not normal, and it seems to be bad.]
(;W[cd]C[Ryan:
I think D18 leads to better results. Follow the proverb that says something like "attack first, defend after" here.

See variations.];B[db];W[di];B[eg]
(;W[cb];B[fe]C[Which move should I play ?

Ryan:
See my suggestion earlier, before Black played F15. This move is a bit of a turning point - his group that you were going to attack is now pretty much safe, and the influence of Black at the top is good. This position is one to avoid.

I think your next move is probably the only choice at this point. If you played elsewhere, then a Black move at B15 would spell death.]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[qf]C[Ryan:
This move is big, but the left side is urgent. D11 is in trouble. A move over there like C8 should come first.]
;B[fp]
(;W[eo]C[Ryan:
I don't get this move at all. Black's next move lets him solidify a big framework, towering over the D11 stone.]
;B[em]C[Ryan:
Good job keeping Black split.];W[fo];B[gp];W[co];B[jp]C[Ryan:
Interesting that Black would play here now. C6 seems like something needs to be done there.]
;W[dn]C[Ryan:
Interesting.]
(;B[cm]C[Ryan:
I think this is a Black mistake. Black's trying to hang on to stones he should let go of here. You take advantage well.

See variations.];W[dm];B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[bl];B[bk]
(;W[el];B[dk];W[bn];B[fl]C[Ryan:
Not bad, and you end up with some aji. I like cutting at D9 better for some reason. The aji seems bigger. It's a bigger deal if you get in a ladder breaker.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og]C[Ryan:
Typically you'll push at R15 first before this. Doing that lets you threaten to connect to your O16 stone and make the corner smaller. It's good thinking to try to make thickness facing your Q4 stone, but I think Black comes out better in this corner.]
;B[qe];W[nf];B[qg];W[qh];B[rf];W[nh];B[rh];W[qi]C[Ryan:
It's an intersting pattern. You're reasonably strong on the outside, but Black's corner is huge and your strength at the top is facing Black's wall - not a lot of potential territory there.]
;B[kd]C[Ryan:
And Black lays claim to this area :( which also works with the ladder at E8. Maybe you could use a ladder breaker to attack L16?]
;W[mq];B[pm];W[nm]C[Ryan:
Seems to be a nice attacking move. Black will need to be creative to survive.]

(;W[qn];B[ro];W[po]C[Ryan:
As Black's next push shows, this isn't ideal. How might this have been avoided.]

Your three stones are way weaker than Black's. He could connect around O17. Yours are facing Black's wall.]
;B[kf];W[if]C[Ryan:
Black's attacking while jumpint into the center, where you just built up strength. This is not good.]

Going the other way is better.

See variation.];B[ne];W[me];B[oe];W[mf];B[md]C[Ryan:
A big loss. This is bigger than the moves around F9 and should have been patched up earlier.]

;W[cr];B[er];W[ki];B[lh];W[li];B[jn];W[km]C[Ryan:
Looks like we're in the end game. At this point Black's too far ahead. I'll end my commentary here.

Pointers:
-Have a clear goal in mind for each move. There were some moves that were pointless - it's important not to make those.
-Have a strategy for your stones. Be flexible - this strategy might need to change - but always having some paln for points is important. In the top right it looked like you were building strength toward the center - you should follow up on this by having other groups (e.g. the K16 stones) help and stay connected.
-Timing. A move might lead to a good-looking sequence, but maybe there's something bigger. The G8 sequence before connecting O16 is an example of this.]
