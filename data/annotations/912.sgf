C[I'll start out by making some general comments in response to your questions and the impressions I get from the game.

1) Where to play in the opening: hopefully I gave some good advice here.  You have to be more aggressive, which is the single biggest problem I saw with your play.

2) The invasions in the upper right and lower left: no, you couldn't have made these live without incompetence by Black.  You waited way too long before playing there.

3) I didn't notice so much about the ko threats.  If you were talking about moves like R11, that's definitely a move you should have made early.

4) Yes, you definitely should have crosscut in the upper left.  I showed one variation but if you have variation questions I can go into more detail.

General observations: your play is very timid.  I get the impression that you are afraid to have any stones at all be captured.  You surround a little territory and huddle there, defending it to the death, while Black takes big strides swipes at you that you recoil from.  You can improve this area by doing a couple of things:

a) Pincer in the opening.  Get into fights!  You should have pincered Black in the lower right; your position was much stronger than his.  When in doubt, count stones.  If you have 2 in the area, and he has 1, you're stronger.  Don't be cowed.

b) Cut when you fight.  Next time you have a situation like there was in the upper left, crosscut and see what happens.  If some stones die, that's life.  If you start fighting more, you may have worse results for a while, but you're going to have to learn some fighting technique at some point anyway to make progress.

If you have any questions about my comments, please tell me and I would be happy to reply to them.

;B[jp];W[cj]LB[jd:a]TR[dc][ce]C[This is better off at K16 or so, where it makes a nice two-dimensional shape with your shimari (two stones enclosing a corner) in the upper left.  The move you played is the wrong extension from a shimari.]
;B[pr]LB[pj:a]C[Similarly, Black wants to play at Q10 or so.]
;W[qq];B[ql];W[nn]LB[qj:a]TR[ql]C[I would pincer the marked stone with R10 or something.  You are strong here and B is weak; don't run away.]
;B[rn];W[pl]LB[qj:a][lq:b]C[Contact makes defending stones strong.  You could still play at R10.  Better yet, attack Black at M3.]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[qj]C[Black has gotten away with way too much.]

(;W[nk]LB[jd:a][lq:b][qr:c]C[Completely unnecessary.  K16, M3, R2 are all possibilities.  The variation shows the kinds of things that could happen if you played M3.]
;B[do]TR[dq][jp]C[Black now has a nice structure set up.];W[ic]
C[The right idea, but too tight, I think.  I'd go a space further.]
;B[kc];W[id]C[Way too tight.  Play J15 instead.];B[mo]C[Black protects his weakness at M3.]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[km]C[You're being way too paranoid.  You might want to have considered cutting at M5 instead of M7 (not that it necessarily works, but it's worth looking at).  And now you should probably be doing something interesting like L15, C7, or G5 (erasing his moyo) instead of defending a healthy group while Black makes sixth lines territory.]
;B[in];W[dm];B[ke];W[if]C[Because you only went to J17 instead of K17, you and Black are marking out equal sized territories.  That's not right, considering you played up there first.  Also, by this time you'd be at J13 instead of J14, if you had played J16 as a one-point jump.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[kg];W[ni]C[Good idea, jumping in before he closes off the moyo.  You might have been able to go in even farther, though.]
;B[og];W[pi];B[qh]
(;W[il]C[1) First push in at R11, because he must respond, and there's no point putting it off.  See variation for an example of what could happen if Black's not careful.

2) Good moves a) make territory, b) defend weak groups, c) take territory away from your opponent, or d) attack weak groups.  Ideally they do at least two of these functions.  This move, J8, does none.  It may look like it takes territory in the center, but Black can easily take it all away; and it may look like it prevents Black from taking territory, but he wasn't going to get anything by playing J8 himself anway.

I would try erasing at G5 or so (after playing on the right side, of course).]
;B[ih];W[jj]C[Same problem.  It is really wasteful to try to enclose territory this small in the center.  Protect the important stuff with G13 or H12 or something, or get in a fight with K12.]
;B[ki];W[lj]TR[ki][jj]C[This shape is really dangerous to make.  If you had those two white stones already there and Black played L11 (known as a "peep"), you would immediately want to connect at L10.  Well, you basically just made him peep you and then let him move!  If he plays L10, it'll be a big pain for you.  Play L10 yourself instead, which makes your stones strong.]
;B[gh];W[gg]C[If you make a move like this, it's because you're willing to follow up with a cross-cut.]
;B[fg]
(;W[ff]C[You have tons of strength in this area!  Crosscut!  Live a little!  The variation shows what B can do - not much.  The F13 stone has nowhere to go, with your strong position nearby in the corner and side.]
;B[hg]
(;W[hf]C[One space to the left is much more solid.  See variation.]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[ef];W[fe];B[cf];W[de];B[ch]C[By now the territories are pretty well mapped out, so I probably won't have much more to say.]

You have to play moves like this way way earlier, when they have a chance to escape to the center.  At this point it's suicide.]
