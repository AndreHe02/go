C[Hi.
First of all thanks for helping me by commenting on the game.

The match commentaries were in Norwegian, so I've removed them and added my own later.

There were some parts where I felt I made reasonable moves, but I find it very difficult to see which are the largest moves in a given situation. Locally, maybe I played a good move, but seen as the whole board, I am always doubtful.
I've added my own comments which are half questions/comments, I hope you can tell me whether I am right or wrong most of the time.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[pj]LB[jd:A]C[cphuhu: Better at A . Q10 gives White the opportunity to make the game more complicated, by playing somehwere on lines 16 or 17.]
;W[jp];B[jd];W[dj];B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[qp]LB[rq:A]C[A looks better to me. Its definetly sente and leaves you more options for later.  The played move is bad, cause you did not gain many liberties, which is the reason you need to add another move...]
;W[rq];B[po]C[cphuhu: This move is the best option you had here]
;W[oo]C[mmagic:
At this point, I should have gone on to play elsewhere, I think.

cphuhu: You could have but the next move was not bad either.]
;B[on];W[nn]
(;B[om]C[cphuhu: This one is a mistake.  The variation looks much better to me. You are giving him  the opportunity to gain lots of influence with this defensive move.]
;W[nm]C[mmagic: Pushing gives him influence towards the centre
cphuhu: agreed];B[nl]LB[jj:A]C[cphuhu: Not necessary. Don't play a move when it only helps the other player. Your group on the ride side looks healthy, so no need for other moves here. Take sente instead and  try to counter his influence, maybe A would be best here.]
;W[df]C[mmagic: And he takes sente];B[fd];W[ml];B[dn]LB[mj:A]
[jj:B]C[cphuhu: Hmm, you are starting a deep invasion here, which is unecessary and quite dangerous. First you need more influence in the center, then you can do this invasion.  I would say A looks like a good move, countering his last move and giving you influence.
B is another option, if you really want to do that invasion.]
;W[fp];B[co]LB[gm:A][fn:B]C[cphuhu: Try to first move into the center. 'A' comes to my mind. Maybe 'B', but that looks very cramped.]
;W[cp];B[cl]C[cphuhu: too defensive, you have to play more lightly.]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[bl]LB[bm:A][el:B]C[cphuhu: Again, think about light shapes. Do not start to defend single stones until very late in the game. If you insist on playing there, play A, but I would prefer something like B]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[el];B[ef]LB[bn:A]C[cphuhu: Now you need to add another move to save the group at the left. Maybe A]
;W[cf];B[eg]C[cphuhu: good move];W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc]LB[fj:A]
[jj:B][mj:C]C[cphuhu: unneccessary.  Build influence, A or B or C.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ad];B[dh]LB[ei:a][dc:b]C[mmagic: I think I played this in an attempt at cutting his two groups.
In hindsight, his groups are alive anyway, 'a' would have been bigger ?
Also, I should have protected against the cut at 'b' ?

cphuhu: see the variations.]
(;W[ch];B[ei]LB[hi:A][mi:C][ji:D]C[cphuhu: What is that move supposed to achieve? Much to narrow.  You need to play more in the center ... A,C,D are good.]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[fk];B[hj]LB[gj:A]C[cphuhu: I would play more solid, like 'A' , to protect against cutting, but your move might work too. You just need to be more careful.]
;W[ac];B[bb];W[ab];B[dc]C[mmagic: finally];W[be]C[mmagic: Why did W play that move?]
;B[mj]LB[mc:a][qg:b]TR[jd][pd][pj]C[mmagic: I'm trying to map out a large territory (moyo?) on the top here. However, I don't really have any strong stones to lean on?
Playing 'a' or 'b' would have secured my territory, and the race for the centre would have been left for later. However, it would loose sente?

cphuhu: Your move was very good.  You have the three marked influence stones to work from. You needed to close that whole around your played stone to force him to invade your moyo. Attacking the invading group should earn you a lot of territory. 'a' or 'b' are not really bad moves, but expanding the moyo looks way better here.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[hk];B[jj]C[cphuhu: Too far. You need to protect against the coming cut.]

(;W[gj];B[gi]C[cphuhu: correct];W[fi];B[fh];W[fj];B[di]LB[hi:a]
[hh:b]C[mmagic: I can no longer see the point in this move. Especially seeing that 'a' badly needs defending. Playing at 'b' would defend two cutting points.

cphuhu: Your analysis is correct. 'a' is the right move here. It would not leave any weaknesses.]
;W[ci];B[dg]C[cphuhu: endgame move! there are far more important moves on the board.]
;W[cg]LB[jm:a][fn:b]C[mmagic:Here I make very little territory but help him to make his half-safe territory completely safe. I've still left the weak points in my wall.
At this point, I found it difficult to find any big points which would gain me territory. I suppose, looking back that an invasion towards 'a' or 'b' should have been my priority here.

cphuhu: I agree that the mid term goal should be an invasion in that area, but to prepare for it, u need to first close the holes , see the variations about how to close it correctly.]

(;B[hh]LB[gh:1]C[mmagic: finally

cphuhu: u don't need to worry about a cut at '1' ...];W[jk]
;B[ji]TR[jj]LB[ik:a][lk:b][kj:c]C[mmagic:This was meant to strengthen the marked stone and give influence to the left&right, stopping any further crawling attacks.
Maybe 'a' or 'b' would have been better, defending and attacking at the same time?

cphuhu: instead of the played move, I would suggest 'c', it really closes the hole and is at the same time aggressive enough to force a reaction.]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[ij];B[ii];W[hi];B[gh];W[lj];B[hj]TR[lj]LB[li:A]
C[mmagic: Obviouly, I didn't consider W's play to be dangerous. The ko wasn't worth anything?

cphuhu: cc the ko is not woth much. The only move is at 'A'!]
;W[li];B[ik];W[il];B[ij]C[cphuhu: still not worth anything]
;W[kl];B[hl]C[cphuhu: does not work];W[gk];B[gl]C[mmagic: What would have been more valuable: the closed off territory if I'd played at M11 earlier or the attacking threat by my balck stones here?

cphuhu: 'never attack from an insecure position', the move at M11 would have had a tremendous value!]
;W[lh]C[cphuhu: This crawling cost you at least 20 points!]
;B[nh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg]LB[rg:A]
C[cphuhu: A is better. You are the attacker here. He is in your sphere of influence!]
;W[rg];B[qh]LB[rh:a]C[mmagic: Too defensive? Should I've played the hane at 'a'?

cphuhu: yes];W[rh];B[ri]TR[pj]C[mmagic: here I felt safe because of the marked stone]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[oa]LB[nc:A]C[cphuhu: 'A' is better. Try to avoid moves on the first line.]
;W[rb];B[nd]C[mmagic: The idea was that this stone not only protected against the cut, but also gave my wall more outward influence (??)

cphuhu: True, but see my last remark.];W[lf];B[ld]C[cphuhu: right spot]
;W[nf];B[mg];W[mf];B[lg];W[kg];B[kf]C[cphuhu: good];W[ng];B[mh]
;W[oh];B[ni]LB[nj:A]C[cphuhu: 'bamboo' connection at 'A' looks nicer.]
;W[kh];B[jf];W[jh]
(;B[ih]C[cphuhu: too small! White has no real threats here. The worst that can happen is...]
;W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[og]C[mmagic: Here, his invading group is caught, I thought

cphuhu: It had been caught already, so this move looks unnecessary.]
;W[si];B[rj];W[sj];B[sk];W[sh];B[rl];W[jg];B[ig];W[im];B[hm]
LB[gn:a][fn:b][bp:c]C[mmagic: This is too small? better play at 'a' or 'b' ?

cphuhu: this is way too small as are 'a' or 'b'. The corner is still contested so why not play there? 'c' looks best.]
;W[hn];B[fm]LB[fn:A]C[cphuhu: does NOT connect! still the corner is bigger, or you could play at 'A']
;W[em];B[fo];W[fn];B[en];W[gn];B[eo];W[go];B[ep];W[eq];B[bp]
C[cphuhu: yes, finally];W[bq];B[cq]LB[ao:A]C[mmagic: In view of what was to follow, here, I should not have been so greedy and just settled for my group to stay alive?

cphuhu: you needed to be very careful here and the played move simply does not work. So, yes, first defend by playing at 'A']
;W[dq];B[cr];W[br]LB[bo:B]C[cphuhu: 'B' would have really troubled u here.]
;B[dr]LB[bo:A][ao:B]C[cphuhu: you need to defend at 'A' or 'B' !]
;W[er]
(;B[jq]LB[pq:A]C[mmagic: Any other point to attack this area? In the middle, I though I'd have the room to make a base either side.

cphuhu: No, there is no room left, as this area is closed up quite good. But you have a good move there: 'A'. See the variation]
;W[bo]C[mmagic: Consequently, I didn't see this one until too late...]
;B[bn];W[ao];B[an];W[ap];B[fq]LB[gq:a][do:b]C[mmagic: I extend the base of my invasion. Normally, I'd have played at 'a', but with atari, I was sure he'd respond, and I'd get 'a' after all.

cphuhu: you need another move at 'b' here. Your group is dead as it stands.]
;W[gp];B[gq]TR[er]C[cphuhu: Your invasion is not gonna get anywhere, cause of the marked low stones that keep your eyespace very limited.]
;W[do]C[Game record:
 mmagic NR : oops
 Gizmo 20k*: yup...  :)

mmagic: The group I thought was very much alive was captured.  Even today, I am not quite sure when I should have seen this. If I'd played D5 before, the group would have been alive]
;B[hq];W[kq];B[kr];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[hr]C[mmagic: I could now connect either above or below, I thought]
;W[ip];B[is];W[lr];B[js];W[fr];B[lq];W[kp];B[mr]C[mmagic: rush to make one eye]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[nq];B[ls]C[cphuhu: this went good for you. White should not have let you get two eyes there.]
;W[hp];B[hs]LB[ms:a]C[mmagic: 'a' would have made two eyes. H1 could always be played later

Are there any apparent weaknesses or invasion points somewhere?
