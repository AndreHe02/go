AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I have not played many handicap games. I need some help in adjusting my strategies to over come the 3 stone difference. I lost this game by a lot and there are many problems with my play.

# hi, I'm goteguru, your reviewer :)

# my comment should be treated as such.

# first of all, I wouldnt consider the
# result soo bad given that you are
# at the same level (7k-7k) 
# and you gave 3 stones.

(;W[dn];B[cl]TR[dk][dl][dm][dn]LB[jq:a]C[Is D6 a necessary follow up to C6. In this case I thought so and got pinched very badly.


# Yes. D6 is common.  If you do not want to get pinched, you might want to build a small base (see var) immediately. Of course black can press you down,  but the this wall (triangles) will be limited by your stone (a). F3 would be also at the wrong place.

# your triangled shape is ok, no need to protect. the possible white "wall" (circles) is fairly limited because G17 is too close and in low position. The last big point at the top is somewhere at k17. 

# but why does it hurt you? Because it is an aji-kesi, an opportunity-ruiner. Maybe later you want to close the  corner in sente. Without the exchange B17 has a good chance to be sente. Maybe later you want to launch a serious invasion at C13. Without the exchange you have a fairly good chance to connect under or press down or cut.

(;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[qq]C[I know that when I have a handicap I always lost more then I would ever think in the corners and in this game I still have the 3 corners to invade. It didn't work out that way....how to change my approach.

# you do not have to take the corners to win in handicap games. There is a proverb you probably heard: if you get 4 corners with black, you lost. :)

# anyway, R3 is an ok reduce move. You already have a base at the bottom (which will be hurt, but probably secure enough).]

As for my endgame. He was also able to make lots of big moves. How did I handle them and how to avoid allowing so many big moves in the endgame. There must be some flaws in how I leave too much aji when I tesuji. Thoughts?


# the main problem here is that white has very weak groups (easy to force) black has super-strong groups and few weeknesses. It's very hard to play a good endgame in that situation considering the fact white is behind in points, so supposed to be agressive.
