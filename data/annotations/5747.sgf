C[In this game I Khonsu was White, I think I played OK & I got what I wanted but overall my territory was minor.

My Name is Joerg, I am 6k on KGS and this is my first review. I hope it helps you.]

(;W[oc]C[I guess this was too aggressive, too early...

No, I do not think so. If you look to pro-games, they sometimes attack even before the place their stone in the corner.

see variation...];B[pc]C[This is a bad move from black.];W[od]
;B[qf]C[this is a joseki normally played when the star point (4-4) is attacked. Here it is good for white, as black gets only territory on the third line. Black could do little better by playing Q14 instead of R14.]

(;W[fq]LB[jc:C][jd:B][dj:A][po:D]C[see variation...

This move is not urgent. And it is no agressive at all. You should try to keep the initiative by attacking your opponent. Or play the big points. A, B or C, and D seem to be much more attractive than F3.]
;B[cf];W[ce]C[I do not recommend this Joseki in this situation. You have a clear advantage in the left side of the board. With this move your opponent can settle his group quickly. see variation...]

;W[ce]C[yes, the only move here.];B[bc]C[Balck could play better here, I guess. I would think about starting a KO fight.]
;W[ee]C[now the situation has turned. This is very good for white.]
;B[dc];W[ec]C[Black helps you with this exchange.];B[eb]C[In hindsight, I don't think black should have got this corner,

You cannot avoid it. When Balck plays on the 3-3 point, he gets the corner. But this is not always bad for white. Here I would prefer to be white, as your group radiates all over the left side and even the upper side of the board. Blacks group in the corner has little prosepcts.]
;W[fc];B[fb]
(;W[jc]C[see variation...];B[cn];W[co]C[Perhaps C8 would have been a better response?

Well, hard to say. I think C5 is fine here for the following reasons:
- you have F3 already in place. so the joseki ends for you having sente
- your corner is now perfectly save. Now the stone at F3, which was an high investment at the time you played it, gets its meaning.
- the proverb says: don't use thickness to build territory.

All in all, it is probably the best move here.];B[bn]

Compared to your opponent you showed your strength in the early middle game. You should focus your next studies on fuseki and learn some more common josekis. In the endgame you did well but should just be more careful. The loss of the lower left corner was due to easily avoidable mistakes. The game was already won by white before moves 192 and 200.

I hope my comments help.])
