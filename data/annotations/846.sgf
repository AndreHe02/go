AB[pd][dp]C[This is my review of your game. It was a good fuseki for both players
but there was a critical time in the North West corner where Black
played some weak moves and the game was then almost in the pocket of
White. After 85, there is no good way for black to try something as you
understand it by yourself

White style is not unusual but shows a good strength for attacking and a
good use of thickness.

;B[rc];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr]LB[qi:b]C[White strategy is a bit strange as he played twice the same sequence that is rather good for white. The corners are big and the white group can still be attacked by playing at "b".]
;W[cf];B[cj]C[Nothing wrong for Black 16 here.];W[cc];B[cd]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[fc];B[df]C[26 is a good steady move.]
;W[kq]LB[qi:b]C[White has protected one of his weak group. Black should attack the other one at "b" rather than leting White play both an axtension and a pincer with his next move.]
;B[qn];W[qk];B[qq]C[This move is not bad but I will have try to stabilize by playing tsuke at 31.]

;W[lo];B[pn]LB[ok:b][iq:c][ej:d][hc:e]C[This is the first really bad move. White is strong and Black should play lightly at "b" for example. Even like this White will attack this stone. Other good moves are "c" , "d" and "e"]

(;W[nn];B[jc]LB[hc:b]C[Better at "b" as Black could attack the corner but not a bad move.]
;W[fd];B[je]LB[ej:b]C[I would prefer 46 on the other side at "b"]
;W[dg]C[Good. White must start a fight here.]
(;B[ef]C[In this position, black plays often hane at "b". As the sequence before show it, He is not afraid of an atari at 48. Anyway, Black must force White to an heavy shape and attack him to ensure the left-south side.]
;W[bf];B[ae]LB[af:b]C[50 is gote. You should play the hane at "b" which is sente.]
;W[ch];B[fh];W[dj];B[ck];W[di];B[gk]LB[gi:b]C[Black shape seems weak. Playing simply at 57 or "b" seems better]
;W[fi]C[Good move for White as Black has no good answer.];B[gi]
;W[fg]C[This tesuji is terrible for Black. Black must have played before considering this move]
;B[ff];W[gh];B[eh]LB[hf:b]C[better to play at "b" for Black]
;W[eg];B[gg];W[hh];B[hf];W[jh];B[gj];W[fj]C[After this sequence the game becomes very difficult for Black. It seems there is a real fighting strength difference between the two players.]
;B[ng];W[kd]LB[fm:b]C[This move seems too much for white. What about "b" to threaten black stones in the center]
;B[ke];W[md];B[jd]C[too conservative. Better at 75.];W[ne];B[od]
;W[mf];B[oe];W[mg];B[nf]LB[og:b]C[better at "b" as Black must come out in the center.]
;W[me];B[pf];W[nh]C[Good as it allows White to block the center. Note that all this sequence is not so good for white and the consequence of 71 which was too deep in Black territory.]
;B[qf];W[fm]C[Very good];B[rh]C[too small. Black must try fo live in the center immediately.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[oj];B[jk];W[dm];B[cm];W[hl]C[Good. Now it is difficult for Black to live in the center.]
