I'm around 5 kyu, and not perfect.  If something
I say doesn't make sence, please email me and I'll
try to explain it better.

Most of my comments will be regarding black's play.];B[pp];W[cp]
;B[dd];W[pc]C[So far so good.];B[qe]TR[pe]C[Good approach move,  The 4th line is also good because of the high
Q4 stone.];W[eq];B[od];W[ck]C[White makes two mistakes with this move.

1.  White needs to protect the stone in the upper left corner.
Letting black get 3 moves against it is very very bad.

2.  If white extends from the wall, it should be at D10.  White's
move is too close to the white wall, and is also too low.  Blacks
stone above is on the 4th line, so it is ok for white to extend on the
4th line.];B[cg]TR[oc][jd][qk]C[Black should attack the upper right stone.

A go professional once told me that during the opening, always
play where there is the biggest space.  If you look around, there
are bigger spaces to play than the C-13 move.  I put triangles
in 3 places that are big right now.

(K-16, P-17, and R9)];W[ci]C[White needs to read my previous comment about where to play during
the opening.  This move is so small at this stage of the game.]
;B[pj]C[Good move by black.  I'm not sure which is better, 3rd line or 4th line.]
;W[hc]C[Good move, but I still think white should protect the upper right stone]
;B[lc]C[I can't find anything wrong with this move, but for some reason it
seems wrong to me.  I think that I would have first played P17 against
white's corner stone.  If white responds, then extend to M17 or even L17.

Right now, Blacks stone doesn't do much other than push white into the
upper left corner.  It seems like it will be easy to attack by white.]
;W[jc]C[Wrong direction.  Go towards the corner.];B[fc]C[Good move by black.]
;W[lq]TR[if]C[I think that white needs to jump into the middle with the above group.
Or else those two stones will come under heavy attack.

But this is a big point for white.];B[pm]TR[jq]C[This formation on the right side is weak.  Perhaps it is better
to directly attack the white stone with a pincer type attack at
K3.];W[mo];B[mm]C[Now white has a big moyo.  Black does need to do something.  Hope
that blacks top-right side moyo is bigger.];W[ln];B[lm]C[This exchange hurts white.]

C[If black does atari from the top, the white stone is caught in a ladder.]
;W[ll]C[Black is now in trouble.  White now has good influence into the
black moyo, and black doesn't really have a way into white's moyo.]
;B[jh]C[Its always good to capture.];W[mg];B[lk]C[oops!  That stone is dead already.]
;W[mk];B[pg];W[km];B[li];W[kl];B[mi];W[nm];B[nq]C[Good moves, give up those middle stones, and try to capture
the top white group.  It looks killable to me!];W[on];B[pn]
;W[nh];B[if];W[he];B[gd];W[hd];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[hf];B[hg]
;W[ie];B[jf];W[jg];B[ih];W[ig]C[Ouch.  Now white lives.

Black now needs to get some stones in the bottom left part of
the board.];B[gg];W[oi];B[pi];W[bh];B[bg];W[mr];B[nr];W[ek]

;B[oq]C[White seems to be getting lots (all) of the endgame points.  Sometimes you
have to ignore one move, and make a similar threat to your opponent's position.]

;W[tt];B[nk];W[tt];B[di];W[ak]C[B 101 + 9 = 110
W 103 + 9.5 = 112.5

However, Black still has one move left....  This would win the game!]
