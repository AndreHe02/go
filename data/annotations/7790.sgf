TR[co][gq]C[What could have been a better response here?

You probably just want to be a little more protective. A 4-4 corner stone is not very secure to begin with, and this doesn't help much.]
;B[jq];W[lp];B[mp]C[It is somewhat bizarre that black allows himself to be cut here.]
;W[lq]C[Good move. Capitalize on black's weaknesses.];B[np]
;W[qn]TR[lp][lq]C[Be careful of leaving these stones alone. The cut makes for a good attack, but left alone, the stones become a target for black to attack.]
(;B[qo];W[ro]TR[pp]C[I think given black's marked stone, this might not be the best play. Usually the hane is the right play after the opponent attaches to your stone, but here, black gets to create a great shape.]
;B[rp]TR[qo][pp]C[This is a great shape. You don't really want to let black make this.]
;W[rn];B[pn]TR[qo][pp][rp]C[This is a VERY good shape. Definitely look ahead a bit before moving and see what shapes you are letting the opponent make. If they get shapes like this, they come out ahead.]

Avoid it. In this case, making life on the side is going to be hard, so you should probably try to run before anything else.]

Black's only weak group is perhaps the circled stones. If you look for territory, black has pretty much sealed three corners and two sides. No one is going to get much on the top side, and you have most of the bottom side. Black is ahead here and you need to capitalize on your position in the middle as much as possible. The stones marked with squares influence the middle. Fortunately for you, you have most of them. You need to figure out how to make something with them though. Try to keep black down. A play somewhere around A, B or C (maybe not exactly in those places) helps to make a good shape for your stones in the middle. If you get stones around all those places, you'd get a lot of territory in the middle.]

Here the opponent lost because they ran out of time.

--

Black is still going to get some territory in the upper right and will probably come out ahead even with your captures in the middle of the board.

The number one thing to learn from this game is still that there are some shapes you should just never make. Three stones in a diagonal line is one of them. It's always going to go bad.

There are also some shapes you shouldn't let your opponent make. If it looks like your opponent is going to get a good shape out of a series of moves, look for something else.

Also, keep an eye on what's in the most danger. When an invasion happens, try to cut off the invading stone, but do it from a distance. Don't get right on top of the invader.

Finally, don't try to save losing stones or kill living stones. It's no different from passing and usually gives your opponent sente. Keep control of the board. Don't give up sente unless you absolutely must.]
