C[Good day Eugene, I'll be doing the review of your game. My name is Diego Guerrero, my nickname on KGS is skamus (1k-1d), and if you have any question you can email me at skamus@gmail.com or just ask me in KGS.

Feel free to ask anything.


My comments after watching the game:

I think you did took some heavy punches on the lower right when your stones got surrounded. And also W was way too hapy with you giving your left so easy. Your fuseki is very good, just try to evoid giving free influence to the opponent and/or free weak groups as you did on move 17. Your weakness is probably the middle game (but if you have troubles in Mid game is because you let weakness in Opening), W took advantage little by little, and you gave him too much for free.

[pp][qp][rp][oq]C[euGOchan [6k\]: quite happy with the last few moves


DG: Sorry but I dont feel satisfy with B's position. Go is a game about surrounding, points and stones... Wich means to "close them from the center". and the marked stones can't go to the center now. Yes, you've like 20 points on the corner, but I think you could have done better. (See Var. at move 21 and 23).]
