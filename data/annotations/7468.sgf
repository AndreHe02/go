Hello, dear reviewer! Thank you in advance for taking your time to review this game.

In this game I played W and won it by 0,5 pts. This game was slow and quite hard, but really interesting for me. I've added some questions, but will be gratefull for any other advices about my play.

/Igor' (Crazyone on KGS)

P.S.: I'm not native speaker, so I'm sorry  for my bad english.

Dudzik: Hi, I'm Dudzik[1d\] and I'll be your reviewer for today.]

[rd]SQ[qh]C[Crazyone: This is not a joseki move. Could you say, what was the right way (and whe was the right time) to punish it?

Dudzik: Some moves are their own punishment. :)  The exchange of the marked stones is good for white, since black no longer has the option of invading the corner.  In go-speak, black has played aji-keshi.

Now is too early to invade on the right side, but later he will probably need to spend an extra move defending.]

;W[jc];B[hd];W[kd];B[ke];W[ld]TR[mf][nq]C[Crazyone: I think that exchange, starting from j17, was faforable for B, because his wall works so well with his moyo on the right and bottom. Am I right? What were the other options to answer j17?

Dudzik: You played fine here, he's pushing you from behind on the fourth line!  He doesn't really have a moyo yet, because it's still wide open at the top and bottom.

I think white has a good position.  But if you don't like this result, maybe you should not have played the pincer at H17.]
;B[cc]C[Dudzik: This is a really bad move for black.  He wants both influence and territory.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cd]C[Dudzik: I really like this move.  You get great shape and sente.]
;B[cb];W[en]LB[le:A]C[Dudzik: This is slow.  The lower right corner is much bigger.  Or maybe, if you're worried about the moyo, you could push at A.]
;B[iq];W[cq]C[Crazyone: Was it more urgent to play around low-right corner?

Dudzik: Yes, it's too early to think about invading, plus this will hurt your framework on the left.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[dq];W[br];B[fh];W[dh];B[fk]C[Crazyone: Now B's moyo looks really huge. What will be the right way for W to deal with it?

Dudzik: Don't panic, is always the right way. :)];W[oq]LB[op:A]
C[Crazyone: I didn't wanted to be shut in the corner, so played this move.

Dudzik: Looks OK.  A is another choice.];B[qq];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq]
;B[oo];W[lp]LB[le:A]C[Dudzik: I think I prefer A if you're going to play like this, because your move here isn't sente.]
;B[le];W[ln]LB[me:A]C[Dudzik: I think I like the hane at A better.]
;B[ll];W[io]LB[me:B][qj:C][qr:A]C[Dudzik: This is the wrong direction to reduce his moyo, and you cannot escape with this group.  You should either play a move to defend locally (like A) or do something to interfere with his moyo. (like B or C)]
;B[ip];W[im];B[ik];W[gj];B[fj];W[hk];B[ij];W[gi];B[fi];W[hl]
;B[hh];W[gh]LB[qg:A][qj:B][el:C]C[Dudzik: You already reduced his territory here by a huge amount, in sente.  Now is the time to play somewhere else, like the right side.  Moves like A or B might lead to a living group.  Or, if you count and think you're ahead, you could fix your shape on the left with a move like C.]
;B[gg];W[nf]LB[me:A]C[Hane at A is probably better shape.  This way he is free to defend on the right.]
;B[og];W[of]C[Dudzik: Moves like this hurt you, as they force him to add defensive moves.]
;B[pg];W[mg];B[kh];W[ql]TR[og][pg][kh][ij][ik][ll][ln]C[Crazyone: Was it an overplay by W :( What was better?

Dudzik: It looks like an overplay.  Keep in mind that you forced him to play the triangled moves!  This invasion would have been much easier earlier.

But I think that you should count the game at this point.  White is not in a bad position at all, even if the invasion fails.  Black played so many wasted moves in the center, that I think white has a comfortable lead.]

Dudzik: You lost a lot of points trying to escape with your dead group.  You had a won game before, but now black has a good chance.]

Any general suggestions about my play?

Dudzik: You played quite well in general in this game, but you spent too much time worrying about black's moyo.  You let him strengthen his shape on the right side way too much, so you could not invade later.

The right side was the biggest problem, though.  You gave him at least 25 points for free, when you could have easily sacrificed your invasion and won the game.  A little more attention to the whole-board situation would have gone a long way here.]
