RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[Dear reviewer,
thank you very much for your time. I added some questions but feel free to comment other moves, too. :)

I think I could not manage to take advantage of my the situation. My opponent had two weak groups, I had one.

Alright, I misread some moves but I think there must be better moves possible before the reading-mistakes...

I played Black

Thanks again,

;W[dn];B[kq];W[qf];B[qj]C[I did not want to pincer closer because of the relation to R4.

LoP: R10 is Ok];W[nd];B[ne];W[od]C[Hm, is this a correct joseki move and are the following moves correct?

LoP: Kogo's Joseki Dictionary says: This is obviously bad style, but seems possible. Nonetheless, Black should come out with a favorable result.

It's bad style because white bumps into a 'hane on the head of two stones' - shape]

I had no idea how to handle this so...

LoP: Result should be ok for black];B[ci]C[... i made a lose invasion. Any ideas?

I am always feeling a little bit uneasy about such a move. Sure it will be able to get a base, but White gets territory on both sides.

LoP: Good Move!];W[cg];B[cl];W[cm];B[dl]C[LoP: You say white has territory on both sides. But if we look at this situation we see that C17 is still open. Black can live there without problems. So is C3 but this hurst black's side formation at the moment, anyway we still have aji there so white will have to add a move sometime to really secure that corner. Even if we just play the D2 slide the white territory there is very small. So C11 is a very nice move!]
;W[fn]
(;B[dr]C[LoP: Too early];W[eh]C[White is building a big mojo while he attacks. C11 was not a goos idea... :/

LoP: C11 was a good move, you had to split up the left side otherwise it would have become too big to handle. I think D2 was not a very good move, it was not necessary to play there. 
Just stay calm, big moyo's like this will always become a lot smaller when reduced correctly.]

;W[fc]C[The corner is still open. At least, I should get a ko there.

LoP: Not necessarily. White has fighting variations available to kill a 3-3 invasion.]

(;B[op]C[LoP: Big move but isn't it more important to reduce the white moyo on top?]
;W[rp]C[I was lucky. The following sequence favours Black. Or so I think. But I do not think White played the best moves he had.

LoP: White's intention is to play kikashi to get something resembling some kind of shape in your moyo. I think the result is almost like white wanted it to be.]

;W[pp];B[qq];W[rn];B[sp];W[po];B[pq];W[oo];B[qm]C[Good?

LoP: Seems to be ok, but white's strategy was a success. he reduced the possible white territory quite a lot.]
;W[np];B[oq];W[mo];B[ko];W[nl];B[qn]C[My idea was to rob White's base. But he is also out in the center, so this was maybe a bad idea.

LoP: Big move. But considering the white moyo on top maybe reducing it now before it is too late is bigger.
R6 is gote for white so he doesn't want to play R6 before endgame starts.]
;W[oj]
(;B[cq]C[I try again here. :)

LoP: Important point for territory but maybe in this case it's better to play from the outside instead?]
;W[im];B[gm];W[gn]
(;B[km]C[I wanted to split Whites group. Hm, the right group looks like it is nearly connected to the top. And I have to be careful, because my group on the left is weak. (I really have to work on my understanding of the loose invasion)

LoP: Yes left side is weak, use this knowledge to apply your strategy. When you have weak groups it's not a good idea to attack strongly. Rather play a defensive move. If white doesn't defend his own group then you can still attack.
In this situation what you are doing is pressing the white group against your weak side group. This only hurts yourself.
(I think you should rather be working on your understanding of attack & defense)]
