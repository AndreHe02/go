C[The whole game I lost many terrority to the opponent from the fights.
May I know how I can improve on my fighting ability and how to know which move to response and which move I should ignore and play elsewhere.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf]C[White c15 makes territory straight away. White r14 wouldn't make as solid territory, so I'd play c15 instead here as black]
;W[nc];B[qi];W[jd];B[ce];W[cn]C[In general at this stage of the game you want to play on the widest side. In this case that means f3]
;B[cl]C[How should I response this move? I played c6 because as white I feel i need to be more aggressive, if I continue to protect my D17, he would have gotten both the right and left side

Come out into the centre first. If w defends the corner with something like c5 or b4 then you having sente is good enough in exchange. You can attack and press down the stone at c8]

(;W[cp];B[cq];W[en];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn]C[A very bad result for white. Black made more territory than he should, w made less, and in gote - you need to come back and defend the cut at c7 earlier than you did in the real game.]

(;W[go];B[en]C[E6 is a terrible move for black. It gives up sente to connect two living groups.]
;W[mq]
(;B[jm]C[B can jump further here.]
(;W[eq]C[E3 looks like it makes territory and takes a little bit from black, but it's not very big. Your group isn't in danger so no need to make anything here. It also doesn't threaten to kill black, so isn't just small, it's small and gote.]

(;B[nq]C[Touching moves like this just encourage your opponent to get stronger, so b has made a mistake here. Better to expand the other way, and then once strong on the right side, maybe harass/reduce w.]
;W[mp];B[np]
(;W[mn]C[Very small, and encourages b to follow you and make big territory on the side. Now is the time to find a Big Move.]

(;W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee]
(;W[fd];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[dd]C[Very passive from black];W[fe];B[cc]C[If b wants the corner, he should have played b17 instead of d16]

(;W[gg]C[You don't need to defend against that cut now. A black stone at g13 would be annoying, but you can prevent it by pre-emptively making it dead at the same time as pressurising black's group.]
;B[pl]C[A good move from black. It makes territory and will help his running group if you push it that way]

(;W[mk]C[Bad. This pushes black into your territory. You should push him to the side, and be happy that he lived. He'll make five or six points from it, and play 20 stones to do so, while you make five points per stone above his group.

This way he reduces you, and you won't make any territory at all from the line of stones between his centre and side territories]
;B[li];W[lg]C[Is this too aggressive?

No it's like what I was suggesting a move earlier. you'll need to come back to somewhere like k12 later, when black has connected out]
;B[mi]
(;W[oi]C[P11, however, just gives him something to attack so instead keep playing above black]
;B[oh];W[nh];B[ni]
(;W[ph]C[Atari from the other side. Again, this is pushing him into your territory]

;W[kg];B[jh];W[jg];B[ig]C[At this point the game is fairly even]

(;W[if]C[Should I have played J12 instead?

Yes, although it requires a bit of reading. But even if you misread it and think that you'd have to give up g9 and g10 its a good exchange for you because of the reduction of black's territory.]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[hi]
(;W[hh]C[Bad move, it achieves nothing and is gote. Any of the alternatives is better. At this stage of the game you should still be looking for 5 or 10 point moves]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[gh];W[hj];B[ij];W[gi]
(;B[hh];W[fg]C[Not necessary (yet) so a wasted move. Again, look at the same alternatives as the previous comment]
;B[hk]C[H9 is also a wasted move];W[pj]C[Wrong direction. This little group is dead.]

(;B[qj];W[kk];B[kj];W[jk];B[ik]
(;W[km]C[Moves like this only make one or two points at most.]
;B[lj];W[lk];B[ji]
(;W[om]C[Good. The alternatives are still bigger];B[pn]C[Now black is comfortably ahead. Really good yose by white might make it close, but black will still probably win]

;W[gc]C[Unnecessary]
(;B[mr]C[Ignoring the cut at m3 for a moment ...

This is gote, and therefore bad. At this stage you just keep sente for as long as possible, even if you only make one point with it instead of two points in gote. Because one point in sente is followed by another, and another, and another ... Skilful play like that can make a 15 point difference!]
;W[lr];B[ms];W[ls]
(;B[or]C[This shape leaves a ko threat at O2 and then p1. Make this shape only when you need to do it to make eyes.]
;W[jn];B[lq]C[I thought I was safe without closing this point]

(;W[lp];B[kq];W[jq];B[kr]C[This is much bigger for black than if you'd just given up the two higher stones.]

(;W[cs];B[fr];W[fs];B[gs];W[gr];B[ds]C[Although i felt that I response generally ok but only near the end game did I realize I was so far behind in the game.
Throughout the game I misjudge points where need more reinforcement but did not protect them.

May I know how can I improve on my efficiency and ability to view the situation more correctly.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game])
