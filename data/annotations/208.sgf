(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[13]C[David: First I must  say that I've only played a few 13x13 games!  A
weird move in a 19x19 game may work well in a 13x13.  Also I've only
been playing Go for a year so take more note of the principles I
mention rather than actual moves.  I shall comment on both Black
and White moves, I think it will help you to improve to read both.]PB[Rolf]

C[David: This seems like a reasonable start.];B[dh]L[ck][dk][ej]
C[David: Hmm... I don't like B D6, it doesn't attack the  corner, and allows
W to make the corner solid.  The corner joseki moves on the LL corner
are C3(a) or D3(b) or E4(c).  I might have played B E4(c).];W[di]L[dk]
C[David: Well it was a shoulder-hit and this is the usual response to a
shoulder-hit.  However, this move doesn't totally secure the LL corner
for W.  D3(a) would make the corner and lower edge stronger.];B[gi]L[hk]
[jc]C[David:  This looks like B is trying for a centre moyo while  reducing your
lower edge.  It's really too hard for B to get a moyo at this stage,
and I think B H3(a) would be better to reduce W's lower edge.  But it's
probably best for B to make a shimari at K11(b).];W[kg]L[kk]C[David: This looks  natural, giving W access to the centre, while extending
from K4.  But B can still take the LR corner by playing L3(a).];B[kf]L[id][jc]C[David: There's a proverb that says "attaching moves  are for defence
while non-attaching moves are for attack".  Needless to say, I don't
like B L8, I think B J10(a) or K11(b) would secure the UR corner  and make it harder for W to live up there.  L8 is also not sente.]
;W[hd]L[fc][ic]C[David: I'm glad you didn't respond to his move.  I think you  have the
right idea to invade the upper edge.  Although, perhaps you should be
more bold and go in on the third line at F11(a) or J11(b).  Third line
is usually better if you want to live, fourth for escaping to the
centre.];B[id]L[jc]C[David: Another bad attachment by B, K11(a) secures the  corner.]
;W[ie]L[ic]M[he]C[David: This move actually forces B to  become stronger, while leaving
a cutting point at H9(DIAMOND). J11(a) looks far better.];B[jd];W[fd];B
[je]C[David: Eek!  Totally unnecessary move by B, and lets you defend
your cutting point.];W[if];B[jg];W[kh];B[jh];W[ji]L[ki]C[David: L5(a) would have  been more solid.  It may still be possible
for B to live in the LR corner.];B[ig]M[ig][jg][jh]C[David:  Double eek!  Never make an empty triangle unless it's
absolutely necessary, here there's no need.];W[hg]C[David: Good move.];B
[ii]L[jf]C[David: W should now play K8(a), disconnecting two groups in  sente.]
;W[ij];B[hj]C[David:  Always be on the look out for ataris and  throw-ins, see variation.]

(;W[hh];B[jf];W[ih];B[hi];W[gk]C[David:  W achieved  the disconnection though which is great.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mf]C[David: B doesn't  have to respond here, this can be left until the
yose.  If W plays M8 it will end in gote for W.];W[eg]L[gf]M[gi][hi]
[ii][hj]C[David: You  should be thinking about making it hard for the 4 marked
stones to live.  However, your centre W group doesn't have good shape
and securing it first is better. W G8(a) would make it safer.];B[eh];W[fh]
;B[hf]C[David: Don't bother about losing a  couple of stones, see variation.]

;B[ek];W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[gl];W[hl];B[ch];W[ik]L[dc][bh]C[David: J3 is  unnecessary as your W stones are unkillable.  A move
around D11(a) or B6(b) look like the big moves.];B[bi];W[bj];B[ck];W[cj]
;B[bk];W[gh];B[aj];W[fi];B[bl];W[gm]L[cc][dc][cb]C[David: No, this is small, B  should ignore it.  The big moves now
are in the UL corner.  Something like C119(a), D11(b) or C12(c)
look good.];B[fl];W[cm]C[David:  Try reading out a  sequence rather than just playing a likely
move.  If you can't find anything that works then, leave it until
later.];B[dm]C[
 jla NR : I'm not quite convinced, yet];W[dc];B[ed]C[David: Bad move by B,  C11 is better.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[hb]L[ce]C[David: I think C9(a) is larger, B doesn't  have to respond to to H12.]

;B[cg];W[fm];B[bm];W[cc];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt];C[David: Jason I think your instincts for  strategy most of the time
are very good.  But, don't expect your opponent to reply if it
isn't urgent and there is a bigger move elsewhere. Don't worry
about about losing a few stones here and there, sacrifice with
pleasure.  Always be on the look out for throw-ins, and finally
don't leave too many cutting points.

You will improve more quickly by playing stronger players and losing,
rather than beating weaker players.  So, set your IGS rating, and play
lots of games against IGS 20-25kyus!])
