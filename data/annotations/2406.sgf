Hello,

Thanks alot to any who may review the game :)
Appreciate the service you guys run.


Quick info:
I took Black in this game. 2 stone handicap against a 12kyu player.

I felt quite confident during the opening - and, to be honest, through much of the game till the end [shortage of time during the last +/- 20 moves\].

I've been stuck now at around 15/14 kyu for a good while - though it's frustrating - because I constantly feel like I'm learning new things :)

Any comments would be appreciated... my own here and there included in the file. I've asked a good many questions... so I won't ask for many game reviews in future :)

  Wasn't entirely sure of "normal" way to respond to this.

kicker>i have marked the most common moves for black with A-E.
in most cases it is ok to play A]
(;B[pn]C[a normal move.]
(;W[fq]LB[cn:B][dn:A][fp:D][hq:C]TR[hp]C[
 **************************************************************
 I would have liked here, to respond more aggressively:  perhaps playing something like H4 (triangle)... though I
 didn't know what might be effective.

 Am I right in thinking here that white has left the right side
 a little vulnerable?

kicker> yes, whites shape in lower right is incomplete. See the variation how you could profit from this.

A+B are calm moves which result in shared profit. B takes corner and white bottom. In the main line black gets sente, which is important
C is the most common pincer. Playing on the triangeled point has no advantage over C and is rarely seen
D can played when there is already a black stone around D10]

(;B[eq]C[kicker>attaching at E3 is only good when black has a stone at K4 already. Otherwise it only helps white]
;W[fp];B[pq];W[oq];B[dn]C[kicker> good move. otherwise white could seal you in starting with D5]
;W[nc]C[ kicker> i think w should play around K4 first. if black plays there first her stones at the bottom become useless]
;B[nd]C[as discussed before there are better choices. but locally this move is not bad at all.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc]
(;B[mc]C[a useless cut];W[ld];B[pc];W[od]TR[mc][ld]C[kicker> without the exchange of the marked stones white could not play this way]
;B[oe];W[mb]LB[pe:A]C[ **************************************************************
  I was relatively pleased with this result. Am I correct here?

kicker>you need to defend the cut at A. Letting white play there would be painful for black. This is the main reason why this line has not the best reputation: black loses sente]
;B[df]LB[cf:B][df:A][pg:C]TR[mc]C[ **************************************************************
 My idea here was to "use" the marked stone as some kind of threat.

 Too optimisitc?

kicker>should have been at C.
the marked stone is just dead. I don't see any relation to the A stone.

 Also, playing A and or playing B: I'm unsure of the specific consequences. Which would have been a better approach here?

kicker>Kakari at B is played much more often then A.
Reason is, that B peeps into the corner while A only emphasis the side.]
;W[ch]LB[fd:A]C[kicker>this pincer complicates the game. I prefer A instead to take a big corner.]
;B[cd]LB[fd:A]C[ **************************************************************

  Again - not sure how to respond.

kicker>book move is black at A, but i have never seen this in a game. very complicated stuff]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[dc];B[cj]C[ **************************************************************
 I thought this worked out very well so far?

kicker>black has an incomplete shape in the upper right. K4 is very big for both sides. And now a running fight starts on the left. the game has become complicated.]
;W[eh];B[di]TR[cl]C[ **************************************************************
 Idea was to add support to lower group against a cut at triangled spot (or some other unseen move).

kicker>it was better to omit this peep. it makes w stronger and hurts the C15 group slightly. Also the C10/D11 stone are in bad shape here.
W will not invade around C8 soon, because i would have to deal with two weak groups then]
;W[dh];B[ff];W[fd]C[kicker>both sides have an unsettled group. but white can
use attack to make territory now.]
(;B[he]TR[gh]C[**************************************************************
Would triangled move have been more effective? I had suspected a more subdued response from my opponent than I received.

kicker>G12 would be the proper move to attack. but i think i does not work here. it would have been better to jump out at H14]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[hf]
(;B[hg]C[**************************************************************
I had no other real choice?

kicker>i like G12better. it attacks D12 stronger and leaves more aji for H15 stone]
;W[if]
(;B[gi]C[kicker> G12 would have been better shape];W[gh];B[gg]
;W[hh];B[fh];W[fi];B[fg];W[ei];B[ig]
(;W[hi]C[kicker> if i were white i would have played atari from the other side]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[id];B[gj]TR[ch][dh][eh][ei][fi]C[**************************************************************
I've been largely unsure of the tactics in this fight. Any broad comments?

I was banking on either being able to kill the marked group or to receive compensation.

kicker>F10 is a good move. If you let w capture this stone E12 group would be out of trouble und white could launch an attack on C10 stones. 
but the E12 stones have a lot of aji because of the bad shape of D11/C10]
;W[dj];B[jd];W[jg]C[**************************************************************
I suspected him to first defend above. My sillyness :)];B[ic]
;W[hd]
(;B[jh]C[kicker>you could try to pull out the K15 group. i think because of he weakness of H12 and K13 the F14 group is not in danger. but this is difficult to work out.]
;W[kg];B[hj];W[lf];B[me]C[aji keshi. at least a waste of a big Ko thread]
;W[le];B[ob]C[same comment as move before]
(;W[lc];B[pg]TR[pi]SQ[ld][md][le][lf][kg]C[**************************************************************
What about something more forward?

I was worried about the near proximity of his marked stones.

kicker>you were right to protect the cut now. but it hurts to lose a move in the heat of the battle now. You should have done this when play in this corner started.]
;W[qj];B[nn]TR[qj]C[**************************************************************
Is my thinking correct here?

To first build a wall against which I can push the marked stone?

kicker> this move is too slow to put much pressure on R10. But since it goes for the bottom as well its a ok-move 
.];W[mp]
(;B[pk]C[**************************************************************
Couldn't think of anything more direct.

kicker>either P10 to attack or R8 to let white run are better. white can live now easily]
;W[qk];B[ql]
(;W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[pl];W[oi];B[nj]C[**************************************************************
I thought I might gain by bringing the safety of his group into question.

Though later he makes life quite easilly.];W[rg];B[rh];W[qh]
;B[qg];W[ri];B[rf];W[sh];B[jp]C[**************************************************************
Any better point to invade?

kicker> dont't know:) looks ok for me];W[jq];B[iq];W[ip]LB[hp:C]
[kp:B][hq:A][kq:D]C[**************************************************************
Wasn't sure of direction.

Considered all these moves :)

Main idea here was to try and split his two sides... perhaps to attack one of them (to kill or to profit).

kicker> the proverb is: in a crosscut extend. but it is not always wise to follow proverbs blindly. maybe your choice was the best, although A is playable as well.]

(;B[io];W[hp];B[kq];W[jr];B[kp];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[mq]C[**************************************************************

I thought this was quite sucesseful up to this point.

I imagined his group's life was in question here.];W[mr];B[lr]
;W[nq];B[or]TR[lo]C[**************************************************************

A mistake?

I thought I could steal his one eye.

I hadn't thought triangled (or other) escape to be a real threat.]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[lp]
(;B[no]C[**************************************************************
A mistake for sure I think.

I thought that I might threaten to take his ony eye...
again I didn't consider escape a major possibility.

This hurt me later on :)

kicker> you had to destroy eye shape. there were not many choices]
;W[ln]C[**************************************************************
A large fight ensues here. I won't comment individual moves.

Any comments along the way?

kicker> you played a severe attack until now. white is eyeless should not escape. I will not comment the fight in detail, but only show a few points where you could have played better.]

Hadn't noticed these stones in jeopardy till now.

Any way still to save them and prevent his escape?

;B[kj];W[ji];B[ni];W[oh]
(;B[ng]LB[mg:A]TR[nh]C[**************************************************************

I think triangled move would have saved me?

Foolish me: I became confident when I thought I had a way out and I failed to read even one move ahead correctly.

kicker> i think, best chance to connect is A. try to work it out yourself]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[mg];B[mo];W[lo];B[np];W[lh];B[nr]C[**************************************************************

The moment I lost this fight - I guess I should have played elsewhere.

It simply stung so much - I wanted to still at least try "something".]
;W[ci];B[ms];W[mq];B[pp];W[mi]C[**************************************************************

I ended up profiting nothing from the attack. Though I don't think I was unreasonable in thinking it could be killed completely? Am I wrong?

kicker> yes, you made several mistakes in the fight. but fighting is mostly a matter of experience.
