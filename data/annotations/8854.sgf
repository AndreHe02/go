Dear Reviewer

Please review for the black side.

This is a serious game that I played with very slow time settings on KGS.

In this game, I found that I ended up with quite a few seperated groups, and I found it difficult to manage them all at the same time. In the end, I found myself around 10 points behind, and I had to play a big move on the side and risk losing a dragon, but I felt I didn't have a choice, since playing an extra safety move would have given white sente, and would have put him too far ahead. Finally, I did end up losing the group.

I probably shouldn't have gotten into this situation in the first place, so I am hoping that you can shed some light on where I could have played better.

Tetu];B[qd]C[S*: Hi, I'll be your reviewer. Shane (smonds3 3 dan KGS) 

You are correct to think that you got into trouble with too many weak groups. Because this game became difficult for black very early there was little to review after move 80 because it was almost lost from that point. I perhaps put a little too much detail in the early opening, but it was a nuanced point about this formation that I wanted to show. Thanks for the opportunity to look at your game!]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]LB[dj:E][pn:C][qn:B][po:A][qo:D]C[S*: A classical opening with a low enclosure pointing to a 3-4 point. General go theory frowns upon giving two enclosures to black so white generally approaches.

Most common 20th century response is at A.

B, was seen in the 18th and 19th centuries before the one-space high approach was adopted. This move is sometimes still played today.

C, is a light appoach which limits blacks potential and anticipates building elsewhere, it is 'special strategy'.

D, was/is thought to play directly into black's strategy. Although it has been played professionally it is the least popular approach.

Modern go theory is not so strict. With larger komi, a move at E can be considered.
Please navigate all branches for further explanations.]
(;W[po]LB[pl:A][qm:B][qo:C]C[S*: (actual game)

The most popular approach in the 20th century to this formation. It is hard to find a great pincer for black here that develops the upper enclosure and attacks effectivly. Although some pros have developed new joseki in the last couple years particularly with the pincer at B. 

A is the actual game, and it seems logical, yet upon further investigation, it is not that appealing. Sakata Eio and Go Seigen spoke against this pincer in this fuseki. (This is very common pincer with many kyus I've seen)

B was thought by many to be an inferior pincer in the 1950's - 70's (when this opening was at a peak in popularity). Now, however, it has encouraged new developments.

C is the most consistant move with black's opening and both popular and theoretically sound.

Please navigate the branches for many more comments on this fuseki, or A for your game!]
(;B[pl]LB[no:B][mp:A][oq:C]C[Although Black's pincer seems well placed.. It is not ideal in this fuseki. White can play either A  or a more agressive play like B and be just fine. see continuations.

C, is actual game and more comments follow.]
(;W[oq]LB[pp:B][or:A]C[(actual game)
This move with the pincer invites some complications, but should be a playable option for white ONLY if he has the ladder leading to the upper left (which he does).

Black A is most natural and should work fine.

The actual game was black B, which leads to a very complicated pattern, and black cannot fight as agressive without a ladder.]
;B[pp]C[Although this move is 'a joseki', I would advise against it until very high level say 5d+. The reason is that this move involves complicated reading and trades and there are many good options available besides this move. Also, this move goes against some traditional wisdom. It removes a liberty of black before cutting. Things can become dangerous for both.]
;W[op]C[White has no other choice.];B[oo]LB[qo:A];W[qo]C[Tetu: White deviated from joseki here, and I'm not quite sure if I handled this corner that well.]
;B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[mq];B[qp];W[rn];B[on]C[Tetu: Is the corner safe?

S*: For now, yes. White cannot initiate any sequence without saving his three surrounded stones.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[pk];B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[kq];B[ok];W[oj];B[nk]
;W[pi];B[qh]LB[qg:A]C[S*: Jumping to A is better than extending here.]
;W[mi]LB[ql:B][rp:A]C[S*: With this move white gets his weak group out. Black's Center group is floating and his corner is in danger after the hane at A. 

If white is secure, black must search for a way to settle his floating group, pushing at B will fix two problems at once.]
(;B[cf]LB[fc:a]C[S*: This neglects the weak group, a problem black suffers from in this game numerous times. Also approaching from the other side later at A might be more beneficial to develop the upper side enclosure.]
;W[di]LB[cc:a][ef:b][eh:c]C[S*: I like this pincer because it indirectly hurts black's central group while developing the D4 stone too.

Black enters the corner at A. Normally a fine move, but here it is questionable

B, is not often favorable because black gets a low position, but here it is good to settle simply on the outside so this is possible (see var)

C, is a much 'fancier' option that can be considered, although at the 2k level (or any level) this will lead to unseen variations.]
(;B[cc]C[S*: Normally taking the corner in most pincer joseki is a fine response especially for those of us who like territory. But here it is questionable to give black more central power with a still weak group.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]
(;W[df]LB[ql:a]C[S*: The 'honest move' but playing at A would settle white and force black out. Having a weak group to attack is the best way to consolidate center territory.]
;B[ck]C[Tetu: I felt that the approach at c6 now would have forced me to take two corners, and white would have ended up with a huge center. Was c9 OK?

S*: This is where black becomes too busy. It is still key to fix one weak group before making invasions like this. Having two weak groups makes the game almost unwinnable.]
;W[cn];B[dq]C[S* The beginning of the end for B. This move is too soon and black becomes very busy.]
;W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ek]LB[ck:a][eq:b][on:c]C[S*: Black now has three weak groups. This is too busy and white should have no problem winning. Black cannot even think about making more territory at the top and will be tied up with weak groups for the rest of the game. Therefore all of black's points have been scored.]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[hq];B[fo]
(;W[ep]C[S*: White can choose to take territory directly and should be fine. But seems that white can chase black around and eventually make a huge kill . (see variation)]

(;B[lk]LB[ql:a]C[Tetu: This was painful, but I think it was necessary. Do you agree?

S*: Yes, and starting at A is a quicker way to settle. (see var)]
;W[hm];B[rp];W[dn];B[fm];W[fn];B[en];W[gn];B[em];W[hk];B[fj]
;W[hi]C[S*: At this point black has about 10 - 12 points in each corner equaling about 36 points. White has more than that on the lower side and corner, and he has two groups to attack. This is the end of the comments.
