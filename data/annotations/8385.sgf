C[Dear Reviewer,
I played white in this game and lost.
I need your help to understand how could I play better:
 My opponent had kind of negative game - depriving me of any territory I tried to make - but I did not how to take advantage of it.

my comments start with "A:".

Thanks!

=======================
:)
Hi abennun,
I am Comsaint (2d kgs). It's my pleasure to review your game.

My comments starts with "C".
Let's walk and talk...];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[dj]
;B[fq];W[hp];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cl]C[A: This is the first invasion I had to deal with.

C: Obviously Black is trying to be aggressive. So what should we do?

Things can get quite complicating in situation like this -- You know that your opponent had overplayed, but you just not sure how to counter it.

Conclusion first -- I think your first move is not bad, but the moves afterward clearly missed the vital point -- and that was where thing went wrong.]
(;W[em]C[C: This probe is not bad though.];B[dk]
(;W[ej]TR[cj]C[C: First mistake: See variation.

Notice that if now black hangs at C10, he will have a fair chance to live.]
;B[ek]
(;W[fk]C[C: Again white should play C10.];B[cj];W[ci];B[fl]
C[C: now comes the trouble...]
(;W[fj];B[el]C[C: Black's weak group becomes a thcik wall. The corner is in trouble now.]
(;W[fm]C[C: not the correct shape.];B[gl];W[gn]C[A: Is this sequence in favor of white?

C: Refer to the comment a few moves later.];B[cr];W[br];B[hr]
(;W[iq];B[ir];W[jq];B[jr];W[hn]C[A: Is the a good play for White, or too slow? With next plays of Plack, his E* group became safe without any compensation for white...

C: Again, see comments later on. And it is not just about being slow either...]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[co];W[cn];B[bn];W[ep];B[bj]CR[kq]TR[gl]SQ[ci]
[dj][ej][fj][fk]C[C: Ok now is a good time to judge the result. How is the situation?
Some facts:
1. Both black groups are alive with points.
2. The white group in the bottom-left has not lived completely yet. In future there is still chance of being attacked. Note that the connection of black at F4 is sente, so there is no eye in there.
3. Due to the stand at B10, white may not have many points on the left side.
4. And the most inportant point: the black stone at G8: this stone tears the two white groups apart, destroy white's wall and make both subject to attack.

Remember: before this battle, this region was in white's influence. White is now very far behind.]
(;W[jd]TR[fp]C[C: Extend at K16 is correct, but the exchange at F4 looks attractive too, since it concerns the eye of white, and black's connection there is sente (can cut white's corner if white does not response).
However, black may not response at G3 and, instead, he can play K16.]
(;B[fc]C[A: THis is the second invasion, and again black had a safe group without compensation for white.

C: Simple is best. See variation.
[Lucky that black did not see the importance of the exchange at F4\]]
(;W[hc]C[C: wrong direction. The stone at K16 is not efficient.]
(;B[db]C[C: But Black is indeed over-aggressive. I would simply play D17 or enter 3-3point in this situation.]
;W[cc];B[cb]
(;W[bb];B[fe];W[df];B[hb];W[gb];B[dc];W[cd];B[gc];W[ib];B[hd]
;W[ic];B[fb];W[ha];B[hf]C[C: Black does live, but at an expense of giving white a solid group after taking 1 stone, plus some chances of making 10+ points on the upper-left.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[jf];B[hh];W[fg];B[ed];W[qh]TR[po]
C[A: I tired here to do something by invading, but did not manage to really return to the game.

I appreciate your help!

C: The game was actually over in the beginning 41 moves.

In an even game I will play Q5 and wait for chances in future.
The invasion of R12 is risky, but maybe the very last chance to make use of the influence of white. In this sense, it is reasonable.]
;B[qf]C[C: Black decided to keep himself safe. Very clever, Since he knew he can win if he does not make any big mistake.
In addition, it is also the right direction to attack: if white simply runs away (say jump at P12)...]
;W[oh]
(;B[nf]C[C: but black's agressive play is not over yet, even he has a very easy way to win.]
;W[po]C[C: usually P9, but there is no leisure to do so. Have to invade.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]C[C: Very good response for black.]
(;W[pn];B[ok];W[mh];B[nm]C[C: Another trouble for white.]
(;W[oq]C[C: an overplay in a special situation.];B[pp];W[no]
;B[op];W[nn];B[ll];W[np];B[nq];W[mq];B[nr];W[mr];B[or]C[C: White lost more points again. The game is hopeless now.]
(;W[il]TR[ll][nm][ok][qk]C[C: White must kill this group, but this is hard...

While there are some more variations afterward, I would like to conclude this game here.

The primary reason for losing this game is the wrong gameplay at the start. The variations I mentioned are not all possible moves, but hopefully you can get some ideas out of them.

Next time when you face such an aggressive player, relax, and stay sharp -- because the way he plays means infinite chances to you!]
;B[lj];W[kh];B[jj];W[ii];B[ij]
(;W[hi]LB[hi:A][hk:B]C[C: I see you made a focus on cutting the black groups -- but actually it is not hard for black to live inside either.]

;B[mj];W[ml];B[ni];W[nh];B[ko]C[C: An overplay. Extend at L4 is better.]
(;W[lp];B[kp];W[lm];B[nb]C[C: big.];W[mb];B[ob];W[me];B[bh]
C[C: big too. But missed F4.];W[bf];B[ch];W[dh]
