C[spiritbear: Hi, enjoy.];B[cp]C[senin3son: k];W[pp];B[dc];W[pc]
;B[ei]C[Here I was trying out a new opening to lure w to me and fight it out though it doesn't work.

vlkplk: Playing on fifth line is realy non-standard. It`s too far from side to be useful for making territory there - white can safely play stone under it. But on the other hand, with its oritentation towards center, it could be helpful with connecting/escaping stones from different parts of board.

Why do you think `it doesn`t work`? Did you have some particular plan in mind?]
;W[ep]
(;B[dn];W[hp];B[dq]C[vlkplk: Black D3 was big move, but I feel that black stones are little bit overconcentrated here. Black could play D15 or C11 or at other big point.]
;W[de]C[vlkplk: This looks like natural approach from white. Note, that black E11 is placed high, so white can slide underneath it.]
;B[dg]C[vlkplk: As for now, I wouldn`t say that black`s `new opening` didn`t work. 

Black D13 is nice point. But, consider 1)D13 and E11 look like to be too close to make effective formation. Would be better D13+E10/D10, 2)black`s would-be territory along left side is still open to invasion like around D9.]
;W[ec]
(;B[dd];W[ed];B[ce];W[cf];B[df];W[ee];B[bf];W[cd]
(;B[be];W[cc]C[As you can see I wound up with the left side instead

vlkplk: It can`t be helped. But still there is use for two stones D16+D17, since they make blacks G18 senteh.

Drawback is that black side is still too much open. I would better capture white C14 immediaately, instead of playing B15. As a general rule, if there are two moves with almost same meaning, it`s better to choose one which captures opponents stones. Simply - there is always a chance that any stone would be useful later. So why not get rid of it.]
;B[gq];W[gp]C[vlkplk: Just reasonable response from white, trying to nullify blacks strong influence in center. Such white wall as E4-H4 can be usefull for supporting whites invasion deep to left side.]

(;B[hq]C[vlkplk: I think that best and most simple would be to connect with, say, F3 or F2 instead of H3. Than 1) if white blocks at H3, black tenuki and plays another big point elsewhere 2)if white doesn`t block, than possibility of H3 remains. Just better to stay connected.]
;W[fq]C[vlkplk: This white move doesn`t separate black`stones.]
;B[jq]C[with this I was able to grab some territory on the bottem

vlkplk: I think, this is not correct idea. While taking some few points along lower side, you have helped white making strong formation, which would interfere with your valuable center. There are much, much more points possible to take with, say G6 or the like.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[jp];B[lq]C[here I was hoping to be able to get out to the middle and force w to play in the corner first.

vlkplk: `get out to the middle`: right. But, already you are in the middle, with E11 and D6 stones. Better to develop from that side.

`force w to play in the corner first`:
wrong. Why you want white to play in the corner? Opposite strategy is better - not to help opponent fortify his corners, so as you can invade them later. As you know, it is 1)easy to survive in corner 2)easy to get points there.]
;W[nq]C[vlkplk: This is exactly what black doesn`t want - white closes his corner, making about 15 or more safe points for himself, while it`s in senteh, because black has to defend his G3 group.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kn];B[no]C[I made this so I could easly go to the middle or the right side if w played else where.

vlkplk: Basicaly, it`s right idea, but why you didn`t play on the right side directly, then? It`s still open territory, so black can safely play around R10, or attack upper-right corner, etc. Notice, how nicely white established himself in center during the process of pushing black G3 group.]
;W[qo]C[vlkplk: Little bit submissive move from white.]
(;B[pj]C[vlkplk: Basicaly, why not, but black cannot expect getting points with this high placement. Why not to play on the third line?

As well, I would try to do some preparatory moves first. Look at lower-center white group - it has two nice cutting points to aim at. Ofcourse, making white connect at F4 means, that black loses his chance to connect underneath.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qh]C[vlkplk: Compare this R12 to white R8. With R8 white 1) attacks Q10 succesfully (white gets senteh) 2) makes more points on lower-right corner and along side. While R12 makes nothing more than protecting Q10. What if white plays R14 next? Looks like the purpose of black stones is just to invade whites right side territory, in which case ONE black stone would be quite enough.]
;W[qe];B[nc]C[with this I was hoping to put pressure on w corner group and connect in the middle

vlkplk: 1) There cannot be much pressure put on whites corner. It`s perfectly safe. 2) On the contrary, by playing such move, close to opponents strong stones, you risk being attacked instead. 3) Right goal on the upper side would be to exploit two dead stones D17+D16 and try to nullify strong influence of whites upper formation.]
;W[lc]C[vlkplk: Just natural attack from white. Note that while attacking, white is making his own territory along upper side. While black has just to escape, gaining zero.]

(;B[he]C[here I was going for either invasion or to just reduce w potential territory

vlkplk: Right, but first you should play G18.];W[hc];B[kf];W[kc]
;B[jf]C[I am aiming for the middle now that I have suppressed w area in the top left.  Was this the best move to be made here or is there something better?

vlkplk: Basicly, right. Only that there is cutting point left at M14 can lead to some troubles later. Imagine white attacks R13 stones first, adding some whites stones in senteh and than cut at M14.]

(;W[fm]C[vlkplk: Black could prevent this move earlier and without any cost.]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[ej];B[dj];W[fi];B[fn]C[with this I figured was a good enough time as any to start a fight for the middle what is the correct answer w should make to properly protect the middle and possible force me into defense?]

(;B[em]C[I was able to effectivly split w middle like I wanted while keeping my stones connected while setting up for my jump to j9]
;W[gk];B[il]C[vlkplk: Now, white is terribly splited and neither of his two group is 100% alive yet.]
;W[do];B[co];W[en]C[I was wandering if it was the best time for w to set up this ko or should he have played else where first befort starting a ko?

vlkplk: It is nice ko for white and he doesn`t have to make any special preparation for it. 1) If white wins this ko, he gets some points in center and can attack black stones, 2)if white looses this ko, he looses just a few points.]
;B[eo];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[mg];W[lh];B[fg]C[with this I was hoping to connect my group to the top right and start my main struggle for the middle and put pressure on w f 7 group.  I was wandering if this was perfect timing on my part or should I have played else where? and what should w best answer to this be?

vlkplk; After white M12, it was high time for black to save his stones around H15. I think this was good choice, because pushing against whites M12 would lead to black O17 stones being captured.]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[en]
(;B[kl]C[with him taking the ko I went ahead and extended and prepare to jump to k11 though I am also aming to jump to n8 if needed

vlkplk: I think that it would be better instead to play N12 and connect his upper-right group with his right-side group. Than, white would try to save his E12 stones, whilst blacks middle have chance to escape with L8.]
;W[ln];B[ji]C[with this I got my wish and put tons of pressure on w's three stones and the f7 group]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[hi];B[jh];W[ig];B[jg]C[this also worked the way I wanted it to since I knew I wouldn't get th f7 group I built around it so I could easly capture the 3 w stones]

;W[pi];B[nj]C[here I was setting up to stay connected to the right and though I knew my two b stones under w's wall would be taken I was prepared for it and move to w's weaker group in the bottem right.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[rj];B[rk];W[rh];B[sj];W[rg];B[qm]C[was this the right move to make to fight for territory?

vlkplk: Yes, contact moves like this one are good to quickly disturb opponenst territory. Provided that attacking stone has enough back-up in vicinity.]
;W[ok]C[I had no choice here but to let w cut my two groups so I went ahead and settle my group with q8 here

vlkplk: It is question, whether white couldn`t kill all black`s stones after cut. They look rather weak...]

;W[qn];B[pm];W[mq];B[lr];W[fr]C[vlkplk: Please, notice the importance of F2. When white plays there, it is 1)senteh because threatens life of black group, 2)eates black`s points along lower side, 3) prepares for monkey jump towards lower-left corner. So, the importance of connecting stones along the side cannot be over-stressed.]
;B[gr];W[ge]C[vlkplk: Looks like minor move from white. Either C1 or O18 would have been nice moves.]
;B[nb]C[here I was aiming to some how surround w four stones at L17 while keeping his two group split. I believed if I would have instead played o16 here I wouldn't be able to capture those 4 stones.]
;W[md];B[me];W[nd];B[od];W[mc];B[pd];W[qc];B[oe];W[oc];B[qd]
;W[rd]C[This was what I had wanted so I could aim to split w upper middle group.

vlkplk: I still wonder, how white could have lost his upper side...]
;B[hd];W[gd]C[vlkplk: This move was fatal for white. Since white`s middle group is already alive, it needs not to go connected. Would have white payed a little more attention, he wouldn`t have lost his upper...

It`s easy to see, why this is dangerous situation: there are too many cutting points - S15, S17, O17, there is tsuke at K17, and with Wg16 white added even one more cutting point at G17.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[hb];B[id]C[vlkplk: Just unbeliavable turn-over.]
;W[jb];B[ja];W[ka];B[ia];W[lb];B[ha]C[here I decidede not to be greedy and go for the L17 group and instead reduce w's territory in the top left.

vlkplk: Godd decision. In fact, it was enough that black splitted white formation into two. I would say, it was abou 20 points loss for white. And still, cutting points S15 and S17 can be utilized.]
;W[gb];B[ga];W[fb];B[bc];W[cb];B[dr]C[I decided to move here since w's f2 would cause me problems later.

vlkplk: Upper-lef was better. Reason: if white doesn`t defend, black can force him to capture two stones while getting senteh.]
;W[bd];B[ad];W[bb]C[vlkplk: Notice, that due to the special features of corner, black could play a ko here with A18. Consequently, correct move for white to get corner was not B18, but A18. This technique is used quite often and worth to remember.]
;B[ac];W[ab];B[ae];W[rn];B[rm];W[mr]C[vlkplk: Here, the most secure answer for black was to play L2 directly. Not playing there was quite dangerous.]

;B[jm];W[eo]C[here w saw that his group would be in alot more trouble if he left the ko here open so he closed it giving me the advantage to taking over in reducing his territory

vlkplk: Well, now situation has changed and black has nothing to fear with loosing this ko. While white would loose about 3, 4 points. Still, white had some bigger moves to be played in senteh, for ex.: Q9, E1, G1?]

;B[cs];W[es];B[cr];W[nh];B[op];W[oq]C[vlkplk: Somehow, this corner looks strange. It needs some repair.]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[pk];W[np];B[on]C[here I needed to create another ko so that I could use it to attack the upper right corner.

vlkplk: This is misunderstanding. You can`t use this ko for atacking some other place, because the value of this ko is exactly 1/2 point. It`s too small a ko. What is possible to attack here is white`s lower-right corner, with cut at Q3. Btw, connecting at P5 instead, there is another ko to take at N1.]
;W[oi];B[og]C[I believe instead of playing p13 here I should have instead went for S17 and either split w's two groups or hopefully take the L17 group]
;W[km]C[this was the over cost of playing p13 here.];B[jl];W[lm]
C[I started to tanuki this and play S17 to get the lead back but instead I decided to play M8.  Would it have been alright to tanuki and attack the top right?

vlkplk: It seems that top right is safe for the time being. There could be some chance, but black must first make an eye for his O18 stones. Otherwise, white`s group L19, which already has one eye, cannot be captured.]
