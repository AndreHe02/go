AB[pd][dp]C[Comment by Erwin Bruinsma (Dutch 3k, 4k on KGS, nickname on KGS 'flipper'). Comment by Erwin marked with 'E'.

siegoman [13k\]: hi
CSchack [11k\]: have a nice win
>>>>>>>> review request comment >>>>>>>>>>>>

SiegoMan ( 13k ) is requesting this review.
CSchack ( 11k ) resigned after move 78, considering the comment above, perhaps at move 1.

my ( SiegoMan ) comments are marked with "S:"

S: thank you for taking the time to review this game.  I am likely to spend several hours looking over your suggestions.  I try to take this game seriously.  I try to play positional style, looking for big moyos and reducing moves.

please help me understand:
- where is my shape going good / bad.  I have been studying many hours on the opening and shape, and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.
- balance between sente, big moves and urgent moves.  Please help me see where some urgent moves are, where some big moves are, and why you see them that way.
- why did he resign
- which comments of mine are relevant, and which are not worth the concern.  I will not be offended, please help me see what is paranoia as opposed to important stuff.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cf]C[siegoman [13k\]: hi, good game to us. :)]

(;B[fc]TR[hc]SQ[jc]C[S: F17 was a low defensive play, I was hoping to Jump elsewhere, and if H17 came be able to pincer at K17 without worries of an E17 invasion

E: F17 is not a bad move, but it is normally not a move for building a moyo. So I think it is not consistent with your style.]

(;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[nq]C[S: I think D16 group is stable enough to leave and take advantage of the Q16 D4 stone support

E: the D16 group is stable enough to leave it at this moment. I prefer F16 and not F17 in this position.]
;W[qn];B[jp]C[S: I am willing to sacrifice O3 to get territory in H3 area

E: K4 is a good move. 
But don't play it after a black Q2, white R3 exchange. Two stones are too much to sacrifice.
After a black Q2, white R3 exchange play L3 or M4.];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[rd];B[jd]C[K17 area seemed larger than R17 corner];W[ph]
C[E: Q12 is a good move.
There is a high move required here; R6 and R14 are both low moves.
It is for white also possible to play elsewhere. R 14 and S16 are not in danger, because R17 and S12/R11 are both open. C6 is an interesting move too.]
;B[qc]SQ[jb]C[S: I felt that L17 area was too open.  O17 did not seem strong enough to support S17, looking back K18 seems more efficient. defending both H17 and M17.

E: black K18 makes it very hard for white to do something on the top, but there are more interesting points on the board. Black C7 is e.g. a very interesting point.

K 18 is in my opion a move for making territory, not for making a moyo. When black gets moves on (or near) E14/E13 and P14, then is he building a really big moyo on the top. This moyo will be very hard to enter for white.

O14 is a very interesting point for white. It builds a moyo for white on the right side and it reduses the black moyo at the top. There were the moyo's meet, are always very big and important points.]
;W[cn]C[Good move

White can't give black a double extension from the D4 stone, so this is the moment to play C6.]
;B[fq];W[en]TR[ef][nf][no]C[S: O3 starting to look weak

E: the marked points are very important points for both sides. They build your own moyo and reduce at the same time the moyo of the opponent.

E.g. place a white stone on E14 and look how nicely it works together with E6 on building a white moyo at the left side.

'There were the moyo's meet' are big and important points. 

It is blacks turn now, thus it is possible to get two of the marked points, where white only gets one.]

(;B[pr]
(;W[qq];B[qk]TR[ef][nf][no]C[S: Aiming at S12, S7, P9.  Q2 aimed at going somewhere in here, took 40 seconds debating R8, R9, R10.

most generous and wise reviewer: could you please give some advice on how to pick an invasion point?

E: Well the first question: is it time for an invasion now?
Probably not I think. 
The marked points are still very important.
One can say: In a moyo game it is time for an invasion if your opponent has a bigger moyo than you. If your moyo is bigger, there is no need for an invasion.

About picking an invasionpoint:
Ask yourself, where the moyo of your opponent is? That where you should enter.
After you know where want to enter, you have to decide how deep you enter!
If it is possible to live inside, you can enter at the third line. If living is not possible a move on the fourth of fifth line is normally played.

I think you enter one line to deep now.];W[ok];B[pm]C[S: trying to play light.

E: it is good to play light in this situation.

But if R9 was played on R10, blocking the way to the center would have been much more difficult for white]
;W[pl];B[qm]C[S: Trying to keep the option of one or the other being sacrificed

E: that 's playing light];W[ql]C[S: I felt like this was a crossroads, make life in S9 area, or get positional influence in M7 area.]

(;B[rn]C[S: I felt more confident of connecting with O3 as opposed to making life, maybe playing too light.]
;W[om];B[pn];W[qo];B[on];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[nm]C[S: used an urgent move to get a larger foot on the outside.

E: getting out is important];W[ol];B[nn];W[rl];B[mo]C[S: threaten P4 and seal in white.

E: Good strategy];W[oq];B[or]C[S: I am not happy with this move. I think heavy is the term.  I was so dazed with blood lust of killing stones that I lost sight of the bigger picture it seems.

E: this move leaves a lot of weakness. Cuttingpoints at N3 and N6.
Killing white is not possible, while S7 is still a possiblility for white to connect

Cuttingpoint N6 is very important. The ladder is now good for black.]
;W[rm];B[bp]TR[ef][nf]C[S: assure life for C3 group, and threaten jump into B8 area.

E: the marked points are bigger, I think];W[ff]C[E: Very good move

Black needs an extra stone on the lower side now, e.g. N3 (see also variation). The ladder is now good for white]

(;B[dl]C[S: this starts the invasion / reduction that makes up the last sequence of moves.

E: It is important not to play this move on the third line. Living is normally not possible, so you have to get out.]
;W[cl]C[E: This is a defensive move, it leaves the road to the center open. 
F8 would be an attacking move.

Contactplays are normally not good as attack, but they can help to defend.]
;B[fl]C[Good];W[gn];B[fo]C[S: I got paranoid about an H3 invasion, a peep seems to defend and threaten to connect with F8

E: This is a good move to defend the lower side. 
But be careful with this kind of moves. 
By attacking white and defending the lower side, you make white stronger (white normaly answers at F6).  White is becoming stronger in an area where black has two 'weak' stones (D8 and F8). 

I think in this situation F5 is a good move, but be careful with attacking groups when you have also weak stones in the area.]
;W[dm]C[S: I was surprised at this.

E: I am also suprised.];B[fn]C[E: Good
Cutting of G6 is big. It gives black a big moyo at the lower side. This is one of the reasons why white lost.]
;W[fm];B[gm]C[S: feels like big profit.

E: it really is!!];W[em];B[gl];W[mn];B[lm]C[S: debated a ladder breaker around G12 that works with G8, again, I got paranoid about O7 dieing or P9 washing into the center as I defend it.

E: This shows how important white F14 is, F14 builds not only a white moyo, it is also a ladder breaker.

You left weaknesses around N6 and N3, so you have to face the consequents]
;W[ln];B[kn]C[S: priority is with influence to center and K4 staying ok.

E: correct];W[mq];B[lq];W[nr];B[mm];W[lr];B[kq]C[S: the high cost of my play at P2 shows itself.

E: It is bettert to sacrifice only Q2, than to lose P2 and Q2.]
;W[el];B[gi];W[fj];B[dg]C[S: I had my eye on this for a long time, now seemed like my last chance to have some fun in here. G11 and D16 seem close enough for an out, and if it dies G11 will grow stronger "trying" to rescue it.

E: correct];W[cg]C[S: I was happy with this, I still have both outs.

E: Again this is a very defensive white move];B[df];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[eg];B[ef]C[S: not the first time I could use an urgent move to give a stronger foot to reach from.]
;W[ei]
(;B[fh]C[CSchack [11k\]: sorry
siegoman [13k\]: please explain
CSchack [11k\]: I looked
CSchack [11k\]: to win, you need more territory, and I looked at territory

S: I was surprised at the resignation.  Sure I am ahead, but at the 13k level... an 8 k would no doubt wipe me out.  Perhaps my strength in opening and reduction worked to hide my weakness at mid and end game.

Could you help me understand please?

E: I think you should resign, if winning is only possible by big mistakes from your opponent. 
In the game (at this stage) black is clearly ahaed, but I don't consider this the right moment for a resignation. 
When we look at the black and white groups we can see two differences: 
-the black territory is bigger than the white territory
-the white territory on the other hand is more secure 
It is for black impossible to build a group inside whites territory. It maybe possible for white to build a group in blacks upper territory (in will be very hard), but white shoud try in my opinion. If the attempt fails, then white should resign.

White played very defensive moves at a few crucial moment, that is why he feld behind.

Maybe there were also other reasons for the resign. Children wanting attention from there daddy e.g.

S: thank you again for the review.

E: You are welcome, I hope this review will help you to become a stronger player.
