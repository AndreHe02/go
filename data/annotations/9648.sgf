C[Hi Stanley, 

I'm Guillermo and I will be helping you with this review to help you get stronger. 

Believing that you are winning a game when you are not is fairly common, it happens to professionals too. Unless you have really good counting abilities, there is no way to really know who is ahead. Counting territory is fairly difficult, and I don't recommend spending too much time on it right now. It's better to get aquainted with other concepts like shape, making your stones work together; and also solving problems to able to read when you have to defend and when you don't.

Your opponent took an extremely territorial approach.  You also played territorialy, so it's like fighting fire with fire. There is nothing wrong with it, but when someone is so territorial you can usually exploit the other side of the coin, which would be influence. Think about territory as cash and influence as power. The problem is that influence is harder to use because you don't see it's value immediately, it's stored and can be expressed in power to attack, to reduce, to invade, to create a big moyo (framework) and lastly to make territory. Influence can be hard to use, but I recommend experimenting with it. 

Lastly, I recommend submiting games that you lost or that were very close. This game you won by a lot. I only realized that until I was towards the end of my review. I still think you can learn from the review plenty. 


lebernard [13k\]: hi gg


On the whole, I feel I have the upper hand over black, however near the end of the game I realize I am not that far ahead even though I felt I am able to control the game more. Why is this the case? Where should I have been more aggressive?]
;B[qc];W[dp];B[cc]C[G: Black is playing an extremely territorial game with this opening.]

(;W[pq]C[White is balanced between territory with a 4-3 stone and influence with a 4-4 stone, but bear in mind that this play move gives a great approach move at A for black. It's not a terrible mistake, but as black I would play there immediately without thinking it twice. The reason is that the approach works perfectly with black other stones. For that reason I recommend playing B so the approach faces your own stone. See variation.]

(;B[cq]LB[cp:B][dq:A]C[G: This is extremely territorial. Black has two corners and now wants a third one. It feels greedy from black, but Go is a game of freedom and black's in his right to play wherever he wants. 

I like D3 (A) much better than B, because it starts working with your marked stone at the other corner. It's good to try to coordinate your stones together. See variation of next move. 


I felt that that is a strange place to attack, however I am unsure if D3 is a better move or C4, but in the end i chose to be more conservative with D3]
;W[dq]C[This is how the joseki usually goes.]
(;B[dr];W[er];B[ds]LB[cp:B][es:A]C[I agree. Playing in the first line at the opening is defenitively a mistake. He is just being extremely territorial and defending the little spaces he has. You can use the opportunity to close the bottom with a play at A or ignore to seal him in at B.

His move at D1 indicate to me that he is not very effective with his play which make me feel I have the upper hand in this game, but yet as I mention before, I only realize near the end that I did not have a huge advantage over black.]

(;W[eq]C[G: This is bad shape. Try to stick to good shapes like tiger mouths. Sometimes connecting is correct, but not in this case. If black wants to scape at the bottom later then this move will be in the wrong place. I will explain why... see variation.]
;B[cp]
(;W[qf]C[G: Go is a game of patience, I would play at A or B. See variation.]
;B[do]C[Big for Black, this is a patient move that got that group out into the center and climbed to the fourth line.]

(;W[qi]C[This move is not urgent, black is not putting preassure on white, so why the rush to make a base? better to flatten black down. See variation.]
;B[pe]C[Now black was the one that reduced white's space while increassing his.]

(;W[qk]TR[qf][qi]C[This move is way to close to your own group of marked stones. That group already has a base, why to play another stone there? See variation.]
;B[qe];W[qn]LB[eo:A]C[Should I be more aggressive and extent all my stone on Q-line instead of R-line?

G: Yes, because the marked stones are in the third line is better to balance with the forth line. However, I would personally play A... where the moyo's meet.]
;B[nq];W[hp]LB[kq:A]C[Too close, you are giving him space to make a base at A... go play there yourself.]
;B[or];W[pr];B[oq]LB[kq:A]C[What is this? this move is doing nothing for black. He could have made a base at A but instead he chose to make an empty triangle... weird.]
;W[kq]C[G: Excellent, now you took his base away.];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[mr];W[kr];B[ls];W[cf]LB[lo:A]C[Excelent! good that you played away from that unecessary move. You could also consider A to seal him in.]
;B[ko]C[If white plays away.]
(;W[ci]LB[ci:A]C[Making this base it's ok because now black cannot pincer you around A to make territory on the right. See variation.]
;B[be]C[Territorial again.]
(;W[bf]C[This is the wrong direction, there is no territory to protect there and that group is not in danger. All the open space is in the top side... that is what we call an area of development.   see variation.]
;B[ce];W[cm];B[cn]
(;W[ck]C[Overconcentrated. If they kick you like that you just extend at A. See variation.]
;B[bm];W[bl]LB[ic:B][jc:A]TR[cm]C[Not that big right now, better to play at A or B, you can always sacrifice the marked stone.]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[am];W[al];B[bo];W[jc]C[Good!];B[hc];W[mc];B[ic]
;W[oc]C[This is ok because it's preassuring the corner.];B[od]

;W[qg];B[pg];W[ph]C[Good shape.];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh]
(;W[mh]C[Should I have played N11 here so that I can box him in?

It's very hard to box him in. See variations.];B[ni];W[oj];B[mi]
;W[lh];B[li];W[kh];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm]

(;W[mn]LB[oo:A]C[Too many cuts, you are attacking too strong, that group is already alive. I would try to make some points there.]
;B[nn]TR[mn]C[How should I response here?
I felt I didnt do a good job here, letting black take 3 of my stones in the end

The hane at the marked stone was too loose and provided too many cutting points. see previous variation.]

;W[po];B[mo]
(;W[qm]C[Unnecessary, It's important to avoid playing unecessary moves so you can take sente and play somewhere else. see variations.]
;B[ln]
(;W[qp]C[Unecessary. See variation.];B[np]C[The game so far is very even. White seems to be a bit ahead but he has to reduce the top left corner now before black closes it.]

(;W[ef]C[Should I be more aggressive here and play D15 instead?

Definitively, like this you are helping him make lots of territory. Do you see the big gap between his H17 stones and his corner? you could attack there. See variation.]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[fe];W[hf];B[he]C[Unconsciously, I helped black cover a huge area in the top left corner

I'm glad that you notice it. That is the way to improve.];W[if]

(;W[kc]C[I think this is the wrong connection. That is an endgame move and its too small. The outside its still very important... see variation.]

Yes, now it works. see variation.];B[ig];W[hg];B[ih];W[hi];B[ii]

;B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[ik]C[The run away black cause many problems here]
;W[hj];B[jk];W[kf]LB[fk:A]C[Better to play A to make some points, altough is harder now, but the game move is unecessary. Black can't dissconect.]

;W[dl];B[el];W[ek];B[em];W[fi]C[Do i really need to protect here? I am unsure

No you don't need to. If you can't read this simple plays then you need to start solving problems to be able to read before you play. I recommend solving easy problems, but many of them. Start at 30k and work your way up. That by itself will make you stronger. If you have an apple device you can invest in smartgo kifu, it's the best app by far. Otherwise books or research the android market.]

;B[im];W[hn];B[gn];W[go];B[hm];W[ho]LB[es:A]C[again, do i need to protect here?

Completely unecessary, A is urgent and also sente. If you can't read this you really need to solve problems. It will make you stronger fast.]
