I cannot find any mistakes in this game (exept final one). It would be great if a review helped me improve.]

;W[dn];B[en]C[Think I got better in this.  

-->I'd say so.];W[do];B[jq]C[Is this a correct direction of play?

-->It's not a spot white wants you to have, but then there aren't too many of those.  ;-)  Myself, I would consider the right side most important, since both of you have star point stones on it and it has the most potential (is the most open) for both, 

.  Also, in general I tend to favor playing from my side of strength, rather than playing near where white has made a thick stable group.  But since this does effectively reduce his potential on the bottom it's not a bad move.]
;W[nc]C[--> This, however, is a huge, huge mistake.  It is way too early to just plunge into b's territory without any support nearby.  This just begs you to solidify territory and build influence on both sides while chasing white.  White should first play on the right side.  N16 and R17 are sort of miai for messing up the upper right anyway.  This would have been the losing move if you'd handled the r17 stone differently.]
;B[oc]C[Isn't it too passive?

-->How do you get more aggressive than this?  This is the base-stealing move you want to make.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jb];B[jc]C[Is this a correct way to deal with this reduction?

This is the standard move.  M/N18 are fierce fighting moves that either split white or rob him of the base he wants, but risks giving up a lot on the top middle/left.  No call for that here -- just squeeze white and make territory on both sides in the process.]
;W[ib]C[This is another big mistake by white.  W must play M18 here.  This is not a workable move.]

C[overplay by white];B[hb];W[ld];B[ic];W[ma];B[ia];W[qc]C[Good direction?

-->This is an awful overplay by white.  He has a weak,eyeless running group and this asks you to strengthen the group that is threatening it!  You should be very happy he played here!]
;B[pc]C[Playable in this situation, but p18 is better.];W[pb]

(;B[qd]C[-->This is bad -- a very slack move.   you let white connect his two weak groups and even make some territory.]
;W[rb];B[qj]C[OK?

-->Convention is to throw an atari in at s17 first.  This makes w s16 gote/allows you to protect at t15 depending on the situation.  .]
;W[rd];B[re];W[mq]C[Hm, the large knight's move seems off here.  If he wants to help the lonely q4 stone, 03 is the move.  This leaves a gaping weakness at r4 that woiuld work well with b's right side.  (r3 open of course too)]
;B[gq];W[eo]
(;B[fn]C[small.  You don't need to respond to this.  If you want to play in the area, why not g5, playing a move that also gets into the center but from a weaker group?  Or else another big point like r4 -- see variation.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gp]C[This sequence is a terrible choice for w -- he is just giving away points here with very little compensation, separating two living groups for no reason.  It turns out that he got a fair amount in the center, but he shouldn't have.  As it stands now, the white g4/h4 stones are on dame points (useless, between-territories spaces), while the black stones are collecting what should have been his territory.  W is helping black tremendously.]
;B[fq];W[jp];B[cr];W[iq];B[ir];W[ip];B[kq];W[dr];B[dq];W[cq]
;B[er];W[br];B[ds]C[--> a smashing success for b.  b has more than white on the bottom and started with two weak surrounded stones!  All w has is a small wall facing a strong b group and the open center.]
;W[ql]C[What to do next?

-->What you did was probably best.];B[oj];W[ol]C[-->W might be better off with r4 here, but he'll still lose.]
;B[qq]C[Is this invasion correct?

--> yes, and perfect timing.];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr]
;B[rp]C[--> Throw an atari at p4 first to give w worse shape/fewer liberties.]
;W[pr]C[--> Suspect move.  W should s5 to seal you down and make some territory with his line 8 stones.]
;B[qr];W[os];B[ro]C[-->Fine for b.];W[rn];B[qn]C[-->why not just r5, instead of inducing w to strengthen and still leaving the cut at r5?]
;W[rm];B[rr];W[kp];B[qo];W[oo];B[on];W[nn];B[om];W[pm];B[pn]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl];B[no]C[-->You should just run into the center with the line 8 stones and the game is over.  If w plays anywhere in the center, you can reduce from the top and side, and then you might still have this move afterwards anyway.]
;W[mo];B[np];W[mn];B[op];W[mp];B[po]C[--> A big exchange, but a little costly to end in gote for points at this stage, especially when the center is starting to look biggish.  Once you played o5, though, this was the best option.]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[rj];B[ri];W[qi]C[-->W is just trying things, it seems.  Your s15 stone is thin, but nothing you can't handle.]
;B[rh]C[--> Defensive.  You can probably capture at s9 and get away with it. But in a timed game it's often safer to do this, especially when you're ahead....]
;W[rk];B[ni]C[Still, white has gained very little here.];W[mi]
;B[il]C[--> I see your idea,  to (threaten to) connect and erase w's center in one move, but this move is a bit of a stretch from the side.  

First, at a turning point like this where you get sente, stop and count.  You're ahead by more than ten points at this stage, so just aim to limit white's center and win.  Thus a more solid move like h9 might be best.  Threatening to run out or actually running out with your n8 group and exploiting the weakness at n10 might be a good strategy if you were behind or the game was really close, but it's not.  Just reduce w  in sente (while collecting a few points of your own around lines 7 and 8), and then take the big point at b17 for a sure win.  A stretch like this gives white a chance to pull something off and get more than he should, which is his only way of winning now.]
;W[gl];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl];B[in];W[im];B[jg];W[fl]C[--> an interesting threat by w, but not sure it totally works.  See variation for a few possible outcomes.]

;W[ho];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[kf]C[--> Small gote move.  Not sure what white is thinking.]
;B[ig]C[--> B responds with  another very small move.  Why not m10 or l9, threatening n10 and protecting against w wedging at l12 (after w j13 b k14) at the same time.    This cost you a lot.]

Overall, I'd say you outplayed your opponent fairly strongly, but that there were some definite mistakes, as well as a number of less-than-ideal moves, on both parts.  

Probably the ones you can learn from best are:

1) the way you handled the upper right -- if you can split weak groups, do it!  (unlike w's splitting of strong groups on the bottom)  This would have totally changed the pace of the game, putting it in your pocket as you chase w's weak group and build both influence and territory.  

2)  the center -- don't reach farther than you have to.  Although there were probably sequences that could make your center move at j8 work better, there was no need -- you had a won game.  Just look at the board -- if you had reduced w's territorty to around the k line, but he hadn't captured any stones AND you even added a few points of your own, you'd be ahead by a lot.  Don't give your opponent chances to come back.  

3) responding to small moves that make local threats -- like f6 or j13.  

Hope this helps!
