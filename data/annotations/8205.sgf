AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi Joachim,

Just some high-level points after reviewing the game quickly a few times (more specific help later):

-  Know when to attack your opponent and when to hold back.  Be patient in Go; don't attack when you are weak.  Build strength first before attacking.  Make defensive moves earlier not later.
- To improve with the handicap, just make big moves and wait for your opponent to enter your 'sphere of influence'; once he enters then attack.
- You made a lot of moves in the centre which resulted in no territory.  I will point out in the game commentary where you could have moved instead.  If these moves prevented your opponent making lots of territory then that is OK, but you could have played more 'lightly'.
- Don't be afraid to sacrifice a few stones here and there.
- Look for big moves in the endgame, try to calculate the value of each move and make the biggest move.  Look at all the points on the board before picking the biggest one.  Pick sente moves first, that end in your sente. 

That's enough points.  If you have any questions about the game, feel free to send me an e-mail dch888@gmail.com.

Regards,
David Carter-Hitchin.

[pj:B]C[This is your first real mistake.  you can play this later, but it is too early because:

- It engages white into a fight, when you don't need to fight white yet.  
- Your corner is still open, and playing like this you could force white to play in the corner and you might lose it.  In a handicap game, all you need to do is build big frameworks, which will make white 'jealous', then white is forced to enter those frameworks and you can then chase white and gain influence and territory.  Here, you are turning the tables immediately, you are entering white's influence which starts a fight whose outcome is unclear.
- If you were thinking that this is a 'splitting' attack between A and B groups, then this is too ambitious: 1) A can easily run away and B (via stones at Q6) is almost settled.  In other words, you are splitting two groups of stones that are really quite strong.  Splitting attacks only work when the two groups formed are truly weak.

The marked points are moves I would consider.

If I *was* going to play near your move then I would play on the third line at R12.  This leaves miai of R14 of R10.  http://senseis.xmp.net/?Miai.]
;W[qh];B[qe]LB[qe:A]C[A is a big move.  It would have been even bigger had you played it one move earlier.  Now it doesn't work as well since white has the B stone in place which protects the RHS (Right Hand Side) of the board.  Nevertheless your corner is massive.]

;W[am]
(;B[el]C[I don't understand this move at all.  I suppose you were thinking of saving these stones, if so look at the alternatives.  This is the classic empty triangle shape which is notoriously bad.  See http://senseis.xmp.net/?EmptyTriangle.  It isn't ALWAYS bad, but here you achieve not very much.  You should have played e8 first.

Better to protect here at C4.  After all - think like this - it's going to be difficult to kill the white stones right now (you should try much later), so focus on making tons of territory.  If you do that, and play at a5, then white looks dead (although with a escape route.]

(;B[ho]C[P6  looks better , since your lower side is settled.  H5 is a good cut, but you need to break the connection at P6 first.  I would also be thinking of white's control of the centre, which would be better to break at P6 than H5.]
;W[on];B[rq];W[rp];B[pq];W[qp];B[ms];W[fc]C[Good reduction from white there, but you also played well and held the position.  I would be concerned by white's central moyo which has the potential to be pretty massive.]
;B[ed]TR[ec][hc][fd]C[Not sure what this move achieves.  Very 'heavy' move.  Your stones on the left hand side are alive, so you should use those to attack the lone white stone which is approaching your corner.  Alternatives marked.  Personally I favour H17 as you need central influence.]
;W[ic];B[lc];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab]C[I think B17 is the correct move here, locally.  Globally I might ignore wB19 and play elsewhere. My concern is white's central moyo, so I'd look to jump in there and start 'monkeying around'.]
;W[kb]C[Bad move from white here.  This is the classic 'armpit move'.  It's a 'thank you' move, since it allows you to make a natural response (M18) which solidifies your corner and weakens white stone.  Another way of thinking about this (although a little more advanced) is that it is as if you played a 'shoulder hit' move at M17 (  http://senseis.xmp.net/?NeverIgnoreAShoulderHit )  and your opponent ignored you.  Had you played M17 first, white would naturally play M18.  As it is *you* get to play M18.]
;B[lb]C[Good!];W[jb];B[hn];W[dn]C[OK but on the small side.. white can play elsewhere.]
;B[eo];W[fo]
(;B[fp]C[Oops.  Alt. move is safe I think.];W[ep];B[gp]C[You lost quite a few points there.  Had you only connected at C4 earlier...  Learn to defend!]
;W[kk]C[Now white shifts his focus to the middle.  White's potential there is huge.]
;B[mm]TR[km][mj][nj]C[Again a very heavy move!  Learn to play more flexibly when moving in your opponents sphere of influence.  The technical term for this is 'sabaki', there are some examples on Sensei's site http://senseis.xmp.net/?SabakiExamples, but they are not great - perhaps I will get some time to add some more.  Basically, 'Sabaki' means light shape, so avoid making heavy groups like this when you are in danger - don't be afraid to sacrifice a few stones.  Locally, look at the alternative points I've marked.]
;W[km];B[nh];W[nf];B[lh];W[mi];B[mh];W[mk]C[this pretty much kills the two black stones...]
;B[li]TR[ph][lh][mh][nh]C[Ok.. this is the start of the formation of a weak group that only serves to take away white's territory.  As it is you hold onto this group, so the result is OK, but I think had you played 'lighter' you may have been able to attack white more - as it  is you are going to run with a heavy group.]
