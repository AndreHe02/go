C[Dear Reviewer.
I have a few questions on that game, and I hope you can help me.
1. How should I have played on the right site in the beginning, the left lower corner and in the end, (when I resigned), so that I wouldnt have died

2.What is my weakness? What should I study more? Reading, life and death or joseki? I just dont know.


I hope you can help me, ChidoRi.
(IGS made me 17 k , but actually I dont think I'm even near 17 k.)


Hi Chidori, 

I'm happy to try to help. I'm a 5k on KGS. My name is Tim. 

Cheers.];B[pd]
(;W[cp];B[op];W[dc]
(;B[qn]C[I'm not terribly used to seeing the 5-4 opening move. Nevertheless, I think this move might be troublesome. The three diagonal shape like this is called the elephant jump and it can be cut without much effort. So once you are invaded, you will have to take care of this weakness. I've made a few variations of other moves that might be better.]
;W[qf]C[I think that this is a bad move by w. You should play a pincer here to build what you started in the bottom right corner.]

(;B[of]TR[jc]C[This move should be played if and only if you have an extension at the top such as the marked point.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[pe];W[qe]
(;B[pg]C[This move seems rather soft. You leave your corner open and this doesn't real seal w in. Also, your wall might be hard to put to good use as it has many cutting points. Variation is included...]
;W[rb]C[White takes advantage of the mistake.];B[rc];W[sc];B[pc]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rh]C[This move can often work to split w apart. The problem here is that you are missing q14, if that was filled, you might be able to take a profit here. I'll try it in a variation.]
;W[ri]
(;B[qi];W[sh];B[ph];W[rh];B[rj]C[One too many hane's, I'm afraid. White takes your stone and gets good shape as punishment.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[rk];B[qk];W[sj];B[pj];W[rj];B[ql]C[Lesson learned! At this point, you have an incredibly thick wall. It's quite important to make a good use out of it. The proverb says "Play away from thickness" & "Don't make territory with thicknes." So if we keep these things in mind. It might be good to approach white on the bottom to see what kind of moyo you can make by attacking w.]
;W[rm]C[This move is slack. White can't do much real damage with this. I would take this chance to tenuki (play elsewhere) and get the initiative.]

(;B[rl];W[sl];B[rn];W[qm];B[pm];W[sm];B[sn];W[sk];B[sf]TR[pl]
[pn]C[This move doesn't work. You might want to defend the weaknesses. W might be able to cause trouble.]

(;W[rf];B[se];W[sd];B[pf]C[This move should probably protect the bottom. The top seems ok to me.]
;W[jd]C[Ouch. White tries to make your wall ineffective.]
(;B[ld]C[This was a mistake that i used to make a lot. I would try to build territory with my walls. It's a habit you absolutely must break. You need to attack k16 from the other side. Try to push white towards your wall so that you can make profit with the resulting attack. I've included a possible variation.]
;W[kc];B[hc]C[This is a bit too close to w's kosumi, i might move it over one point to the left.]
;W[hd];B[gd];W[ic]C[This is a mistake in my opinion. White should net give you good shape with this atari.]

(;B[gc];W[ce];B[ib]C[Playing on the second line might be a bit slow here. It'd be wise to play the atari and build the extra strength.]
;W[jb];B[he]C[Here it is!];W[id];B[ha]C[This isn't quite as effective now that w has C15 in place. W can cut at g15 and it would really hurt.]

(;W[jf];B[eb];W[db];B[da]C[This is endgame stuff. Much too small for the current situation. Your group is in deep trouble if w cuts with g15.]
;W[ca];B[ea];W[bb];B[ec];W[ee]C[An odd move. You do a good job of taking advantage.]

(;B[ki];W[hh];B[kh];W[kg];B[mh];W[ip]C[White beats you to it.]

(;B[oi];W[nj];B[mi];W[ni]C[ChidoRi has resigned the game.

There were definitely some life and death mistakes, but I don't think that was the main issue. The best way to work on that stuff would be to do lots of life and death problems at goproblems.com You might also want to take a look at tesuji problems. 

The big issue seems to me the wall. Once all the dust settled from your first fights on the right...you had that massive wall. The only way to win the game after that is to make sure that it gets put to good use. I went back to the beginning of the game and included an example that illustrates the point.


Overall, I think you have a good deal of potential, and I like the fighting spirit. It's just a matter of knocking out a few opening concepts, and you will be a single digit kyu before you know it.

I hope this has been helpful.

Take care,
Tim])
