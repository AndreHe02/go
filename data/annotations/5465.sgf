C[Hello Danny,

I will try to review your game as best as possible, I like the amount of questions you added, thats the way I like to review games.

Dear Reviewer,

I played as black in this game. I didn't fare so well. As my rank improves and I play stronger players, I notice their openings are usually better. Please review this game for me and point out mistakes, tips and ways I can improve.

Thank You,

Danny Kwon];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[pn]

(;B[pl]C[Danny: I've heard people say R4 is usually what white wants so it's better to play a pincer. Is R4 a good solid move that wouldn't leave black behind?

Balladeer: Both answering in the corner and pincering are good, this however, is not the ussual pincer, see variation]

(;W[qo]C[White helps you to get back to a normal joseki];B[np]
;W[rq];B[jq];W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[Danny: I thought about R12. There is an invasion point but I think it's better because I think white has to settle R14.

Balladeer: I agree, for more than one reason:

See the variations for R12

And, if you pincer here and white invades sansan, it is not easy to build a good wall towards the top.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]
(;W[qg]C[The shape looks strange...]
(;B[og]C[Like this black leaves bad aji in his wall...]
(;W[ph]C[very strange! You should read deeper here, whites shape is very bad, so if you take a little time here, it should be possible to find the weak spot...]

(;B[oj]TR[qi][pl]C[Danny: is it better to push at Q11? The marked stones look weakened and overcentrated.

Balladeer: A push at Q11 is not a good idea here, see variations]
;W[pi]C[Stange push, only makes black stronger];B[pj];W[qb]
C[Danny: I think I've seen some games where Q18 wasn't played. It seems early to play on the second line. Later the Q17 group becomes a weak group. It was my first time trying this idea. I think it's not good and in the game it didn't turn out well.

Balladeer: It is very good to play this move for white, it stops black from pushing in at R15 and cutting, wich you seemed to have missed this game. Now the game is not so easy to play for black, he might have territory problems later, and his wall at Q17 is indeed a weak wall...]
;B[fq]C[Danny: Is it  better to approach at C6 rather than F3?

Balladeer: Both are fine, I'd prefer this one, but i think it's personal]
;W[mp]C[This looks like a big overplay by white. His group in the corner is not very strong, and he does not have any stones in the neighbourhood to help him during the fighting.]

(;B[mq]C[This is ussually not so good, it makes it a little to easy for white to get a good shape, for attacking O5 is better.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mo]C[Danny: I don't know the proper response to N4. I think this doesn't work. Maybe M2 is better?

Balladeer: this makes white very strong, so I think black should try something else, M2 doesnt feel very appropriate though..]
;W[lp]
(;B[mr]C[This is not good for black, too many cutting points...]

(;W[jp]C[So this is not good either, better to cut at O3, this only makes black strong]

(;B[lr]C[possible, since it removes the white possibility of cutting at O3, but you really dont want to give white J3, because that also weakens F3, so I'd just be happy that white made my stone stronger]
;W[iq];B[jr]C[good, you have to keep white in trouble];W[fp]

(;B[gp]TR[dp][fp][gq][iq]C[This is not so good, the white cut is perfect, if you can cut with all the triangle stones in place, it is ussually good for you]
;W[gq]
(;B[fr]C[Danny: I misread here. Things didn't turn out the way I thought it would in the game.

Balladeer: I see, this doesnt feel very good indeed, it seems hard for black to keep it all together]
;W[hp];B[go];W[fo];B[gr];W[hq]
(;B[cq]C[big, but costly since you will lose G5];W[cp];B[dq]
;W[gn]C[Black is very unhappy for losing these 2 stones!];B[ck]
;W[ci]
(;B[cn]C[This is a way to make a base, but it looks better to jump out instead, when you play like this white will get a choice between pushing from above and attacking you by taking the base away]

(;W[bq];B[br];W[bo]C[this is a little early, better to see what happens at the top, maybe white wants to make a wall instead of attacking this]
;B[ek]C[good];W[lc]C[Now white is going to use the weaknesses of the black wall]

(;B[kc]C[This makes white stronger, so ussually you will be unwilling to play these kind of moves]
;W[ld];B[nc]C[Needed for the black group, but white will get to play K15, wich is vital in this shape, another reason not to play L17]

(;W[kb]C[strange move! white wants to get out, not to make black stronger]
;B[jb];W[mb];B[nb];W[lf]
(;B[me]C[not very handy, since white has the atari at L16];W[kd]
;B[jc];W[jf]C[N15 seems a little... idle]
(;B[nh]C[Danny: Is there a faster better move?

Balladeer: N13 is a little better shape, but maybe you should try to take some points away from white, since you will not have enough like this.]
;W[ec];B[fd]C[now white clearly is ahead, since white's top right corner is about as much as blacks bottom, but white has the top left.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[je];W[kf];B[qm]C[Danny: Is J16 necessary in this situation?

Balladeer: No, I think you mean another move, but it is unclear to me wich one.
R7 is a good move, there is nothing where you can force, so you will just have to wait for a chance]
;W[qr]
(;B[pr];W[rn]C[Danny: I think black lost points here.

Balladeer: Maybe a little, but not much I think];B[rm]C[Danny: Should black play somewhere else?

Balladeer: No, this is a good move, you create aji at S4, with a chance to take the outside. Besides, there are not many really big points...]
;W[hf]
(;B[hd];W[ge];B[gd];W[dl];B[dk];W[bm]
(;B[bl]C[you need to make your group solid, B8 does not look like the move to do that]

(;B[bi];W[bj];B[cj];W[bh];B[di];W[ch]C[Danny: I think I should've started with B11

Balladeer: you did...];B[fi];W[hi];B[eg]C[Danny: Is G9 better?

Balladeer: This is a very unclear fight, but you got into too much trouble with this group. White is getting strong in the centre, so you will not get a chance to get back into the game. 

You are behind a lot now here, later you say that you thought you should have resigned, and I have to agree. The game is over here, so I have added no more comments. I hope you learnt from what i added!]
