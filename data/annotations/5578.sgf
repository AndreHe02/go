;B[qe]C[z -- Hello reviewer!  I am Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  My comments are marked with "z -- ".  I played white in this game.  I resigned after black played a cutting sequence that I had overlooked, but the game up to that point was also interesting to me.  I felt like I was struggling to avoid falling behind, while staying just close enough to not resign.  I'm looking for different strategic or tactical ideas that might have enabled me to take the lead.

Thank you for your time.

 Reviewer(r---): Hi! 
Though i am not strong, i would like to do my best for this review.]
;W[pp];B[ep];W[cd];B[fd];W[hc]C[z -- perhaps this pincer is wrong, since the top right corner is black.
r--i think so, but  not too bad in the begining.];B[kd];W[he]
LB[ec:B][fc:A][ed:C]C[z -- this seems ordinary, but I didn't see anything better.
r--:  i think that the best  move is f-17, thereafter, black:3, white:3---- and the second is your choice (h-15).]
;B[ff];W[dg]LB[fb:A][kb:C][lb:D][mb:G][ec:B][kc:F][lc:E]C[r---Later you moved A and C( black B,D,F)
    Those move must start in this stage, black could not respond D move but E.]
;B[pc];W[hg]LB[fb:A][kb:B]TR[je][if][jf]C[z -- is this the right direction?
r--As next black move(F-12)  is so good (ideal devision of two white stones),  i suppose triangle points are better.]
;B[fh];W[di];B[fj];W[dk];B[kg];W[hi];B[fl]LB[fi:B][gi:A][ki:E]
[fk:D][gk:C]C[r--As left side white stones are living, left side moving is not urgent. Urgent is to live of the central stones.
As an example, A-E moves are presented.];W[dm]C[r---As left side white stones are living, not urgent in left side. central  white stones are not living, therefore first priority is to live these stones.]
;B[co];W[fb];B[ec];W[kb]C[If  you want  to have this choice move]
;B[lb]LB[eb:C][jb:A][cc:E][dc:D][lc:B]C[Normally  your choice is right way. But in this case, living of central white stones  is essential as shown in A-E.]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[mb];B[jb];W[la];B[id]LB[ea:D][db:A][eb:B][cc:C]
[me:E]TR[ja]C[r---Before connection,   you must think sacrificing these stones. Now you should A (B,C,D ; triangle point move later)
and thereafter E.];W[hd];B[nc];W[ld]LB[ic:a]C[z -- later I wished I had forced at A somewhere in here.]
;B[ke];W[nd];B[od];W[ne];B[le];W[nb];B[hk]LB[ng:B][ki:A]C[r---Now escape of the central stones are difficult.
  Therefore next white move may be A or B point];W[ij];B[ng]
;W[ob];B[oc];W[mc];B[kj]C[z -- this hurt ...];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[bm]C[z -- but then black didn't continue];W[jl]
;B[im];W[jm];B[in];W[jn];B[jo];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[lq]
;B[jq]LB[mp:A][lr:B]C[r--A is right way. but in this case you should choose B.
 later according to the monkey jump, black area become small.]
;W[cq]LB[lr:A]C[z -- is this correct timing?
r-- As living of this white stones is diificult
position A is urgent point as shown before.];B[dr];W[dq];B[eq]
;W[cr];B[er];W[bo];B[bn]LB[bp:A]C[r---black did mistake(B-6).  white stones can not live by move A.]
;W[bp];B[bj];W[cn];B[cm];W[dn];B[ch];W[ci];B[bi];W[ck];B[bk]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[ee]C[z -- this solidified black and allowed the cut later .. but what is a good alternative?]
;B[fe]LB[do:A]C[r---move A  (connection of  two white stones)
wa urgent than the next move (B14).];W[bf];B[do];W[br];B[cc]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[ce];B[qp];W[qq]C[z -- would the outside hane have been better in this situation?]
;B[qo];W[rq];B[po];W[op];B[pk];W[pj]C[z -- I have to break up the right side somehow.  Is this move correct?]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[pl];W[qi];B[rj];W[pi];B[rk];W[pf];B[of];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[pb];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[qc];W[mi];B[nf];W[ki]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mh];W[mj];B[ic]C[z -- I think I should have played this point in sente earlier.]
;W[lr];B[bb];W[cb];B[db];W[dc];B[ja];W[ka];B[cc];W[dh];B[bh]
;W[dc];B[cs];W[bs];B[cc]LB[an:A];W[de]C[z -- I couldn't find any ko threats big enough, since my whole group on the right could die.
r---Now black has many kou threats.
Your choice was right.];B[ca];W[ad];B[ef];W[df];B[ih];W[hh]
;B[hf];C[Result: B+Resign
r---In go game, living or not living is essential.
and if  living of the stones is seemed to be difficult, then must think sacrificeing it.
If you had such idea, i think your proceeding may be remarkable.]
