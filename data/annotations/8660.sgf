C[This review is mainly for black.];B[pd];W[cd];B[qp];W[dq]
(;B[fc]C[Nothing wrong, but usually E17 is preferred because it forces white to defend, and the game variation gives white a little too much corner.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[fd];W[nq]LB[jc:B][jd:C][cf:A]C[Be aware that white should play A to finish the joseki, and black should play B or C to make use of the wall (F17) he's made.]

(;B[sq]C[See variation; playing on the other side keeps white low, and you get influence towards the top.]
;W[kr]
(;B[jq]C[Not sure about this move. It seems a bit odd. But playing K2 gives white a forcing move. See variation.]

(;B[qf]C[After white E5, you may consider a bigger move. See variations.]
;W[fk];B[qj]LB[ch:B][ck:A]C[Good extension, but be aware you're playing on the 3rd line on this side, while white is playing on the fourth line on the other side. So you have to invade or reduce there (A, B, for example) or you will lose on points.]

C[You played a good overall game. I think you lost because you either had to 
a) stop white from getting a big area in the first place, or
b) invade/reduce the white left side earlier, or 
c) build and defend a bigger black right side of youor own.

- In the opening, you were a bit easy on white, and white played bigger moves.
- The area in the middle bottom part isnt that big. Generally: corners first, then sides, then center.]
