I think this shows why third line would have been better.];B[qe]

Inconsistent play... You played on the fourth line, that's light and fluffy, "airy" you might say, but here you play down on the third line, as if you want to secure a base here. For example, between A and B, A is clearly superior, but overall I would have played around C I think. Since the two stones are on the fourth line you also do not have to worry so much about them being attacked 'cause they can much more easily "fly away" than third-line stones.

Of course, not forgetting D, still... D stays important for a long time.]

Let's assess... A & B & C looks like forcing moves, right? So they're individually expendable, to save the bulk of your structure here (but that just got pretty split, though).]

This focuses on what might be treated as a forcing-move stone... And it walks into a hitting-at-the-head-of-two-stones pattern.]

White should have taken care of the marked group, since now you can attack it, but not as severely as possible due to some of your previous ill-advised forcing moves.]

(;B[ip]LB[ip:B][lp:A]C[is there a better way to attack the bottom?

---

Notice this move and think about it, 'cause it's a "panic move." White played A, and you looked toward the bottom and thought "oh my look at that big area white has here I must do something to disrupt it!!!!"

Building moyos is kinda like in movies when cars race toward each other seeing who will swerve first. Here, you swerved.

Invasions like these are generally welcome.]

I think you play maybe all-round well on your OWN level, and don't have any glaring misgivnigs in any particular direction. Your fighting might be better than 20k. :-)

The leitmotif about this game would be recognizing the differences between playing on the third and fourth line and when to do what etc. That's what I would recommend you work on.

Fourth line "invasion" is mainly when you want to reduce an area (and are planning to run toward the center). Third line (or even second line) is for when you really want to invade and will try to live.

Likewise, in opening, fourth line is for when you want to dominate the center for later fighting. Third line is for making bases. Don't play on the fourth line and then start making a base down on the third line; and, likewise, don't play on the third line and then play toward the center without making a base first (e.g. white made this mistake on move 8)..

Hope this helps,
