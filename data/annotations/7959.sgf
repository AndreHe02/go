C[Dear reviewer, thank you very much for taking your time to review this game!
I played black and lost by resignation. There are some questions during the game, but I'll appreciate alot any your suggestions about  mistakes, that I can't realizy myself.
Maybe you could advise, which parts of the game I need to improve most?

Kind regards!

;B[qo]C[FR: maybe q5 was better to neutralize whites potencial on the left?

* I cannot say that R5 is bad, but I would also like Q5 or P4 better.]
;W[oo];B[jp]C[FR: maybe it was better to answer p5 locally?
If "yes", then what was the right move? I thought about q6 or o3.

* P5 is an intersting move, I believe it is a bit slow but not a bad idea after black played low with R5. Probably R5 was a mistake.

The game move is agressive, I am not sure if it is overplay. I would prefer to answer locally at Q6. O3 prevents w P3 but white simply answers N3 and is fine.]
(;W[cr]C[* Especially after the D7 C8 exchange, black does not need to answer this move.]

;B[fc]C[FR: now I think, that f17 is wrong direction, becaucs the bottom is more important.
Was it better to play g3 or even f8 instead?

* G8 does not do much, I think, I enjoy G3 more. F17 is ok locally, but the bottom is more interesting.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]C[* If black can play Q6, then I'd enjoy R13 more than R17. Since we don't know yet, I suggest not to play locally but tenuki.]

(;W[rc]C[FR: black gain very little in the last 12 moves. So, where there any better way to deal with f16 and h17?

* This is yose, very slow. The bottom needs to be resolved (G3!). The white top group is heavy and eyeless!!]
(;B[gq];W[bq]C[* Yose! This is small.

* If it were not for the weird move at R8, black could play Q6 now and create another weak group while guilding points. But here, Q6 is overconcentrated, I think. So maybe N6 for black? I don't know :) Maybe L3 is enough.]

So any comments about the following moves are especially welcome.
Maybe there are some better moves to prepare attack on white stones?

* The cut looks natural. Just run out and keep white weak.]

Thank you in advance for review!

* White has a cut in Q8 and Q10 o I'm not sure if N13 is needed. Maybe black can get both the yose and move his group out at the same time. But still, black is behind.]

* Allowing white to sabaki at Q2 was the main mistake. You should have removed the white eyespace and shape and butcher some of the many weak white groups.

* You need to improve all areas of play. Watch out for the correct direction of play (this requires you to know the usual shapes by heart, so watch high dan games and try to remember their shapes). You should try to always predict at least 5 moves ahead, at every single move in the game, so try to read a lot and find the best move for either plays at any time. Practice reading ladders, too, this always helps, I suggest long (50-100+) moves ladders.

* Also have a look at the "Game of Go" proposal at Area51 over at stackexchange.com, we need followers to get a great, free site about Go ;)

* Good luck, and thanks for your presentation.]N[RESULT])
