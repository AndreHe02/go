Result: Black + 60

Review by Joe Carl (6k* IGS - shadow)

If you play in IGS I would recomment playing at the 20Kyu to 15Kyu level

Black should take white next time and maybe give a 2 stone handicap.   things to study:

1) Tesuji
2) Opening
3) life and death];B[pd];W[co]C[White emphasizes the left side]
;B[pq]
(;W[oo]LB[po:a][qo:b][qn:c]C[This is a very unconventional approach.  "a", "b" or "c" are more common.   But I think the timing is wrong anyway.  The top left empty corner is the biggest place to play on the board right now.]

(;B[po]LB[qo:a][pm:b]C[Contact moves usually strength the opponent and do not attack well.  There is a proverb that says "Do not touch the stones you are attacking"

"a" is a better attack, taking profit in the corner and eliminating any weakness.

"b" would probably induce white to play "a" and then it defaults into a known joseki that would work in blacks favor.

However the top left corner is still the biggest play on the board.  Black should ignore whites move and take 3 corners.]
;W[dd]C[P5 feels like an outright loss now.  If white had played D16 first then black played q5, would white play p5?  I don't think so.  This is one clue that P5 was a bad move.]
;B[dq]LB[jp:a][ep:b]C["a" or one line lower is better.   "b" stops white from pressing black down so low.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]
(;B[dp]C[This is a bad move];W[do];B[bp];W[bo];B[ci]C[This is a bad move by black.  Stay away from thickness.  White got thick down below and black should avoid it.  Besides black is very weak in the corner. White can turn the corner at F3 and seal black in (very bad), and possibly kill the corner as well.]

(;W[en]C[White should attack the black stone.  the cut at e5 is not a threat.]
;B[cp]
(;W[pf]LB[cg:a]C[Playing high here has no useful meaning.  The 4th line is for influence the 3rd line is for territory.  there is no influence to be had or destroyed here.  Just take territory.

However there is a black stone on the left that can be attacked in a very big way!  Push black into the white wall to the south and take territory]

(;B[nc]LB[nd:a]C[A is the only answer here.  White can not invade the corner so there is no reason to play low and protect it by playing low.]

(;W[ei]C[A capping move is used to reduce territory.  This is a thank you move.  Black should say thank you for white forcing him to settle his stone.

White has a bad habit of making a move then leaving the position unsettled.]
;B[cf]LB[dg:a]C[A decent move.  There is a proverb that says "Answer the capping move with a knights move".  Thus "a" is the proper move. Black will be able to get a base on the side and will be able to cut whites stones apart.]
;W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[ad]C[Why not simply b16?  Now Black has some threats in the corner.]
;B[ef]LB[ff:a][dk:b]C[Wrong direction, and too slow.  Black can extend to "a" if he really wants to play here.  "b" is better, cutting e11 off from its friends.  White has 3 groups to attack while black has none.]

(;W[re]LB[fd:A]C[W: Is it better to play A?

No White's top left corner is settled.  Whites stones on the left side are weak and need a base.

S15 is not a goo move either since it doesn't provide white a base.  White still has multiple groups that are vunlerable while black has none.

Q6 might be interesting idea to settle whites stones on the left side]
;B[jd]LB[qc:a]C[Black should protect the corner by playing at "a".  If white plays at "a" then white settles one stone and black lost a lot in the exchange]

(;W[qo]
(;B[op]LB[qp:a]C[black should play "a" to keep the corner];W[qp]
;B[no]LB[qq:a]C["a" is better];W[pn];B[on]C[But then a ponnuki is great :)]
;W[pm];B[jp]LB[qq:a]C[Taking the corner with "a" is better

Besides 4th line is for influence, 3rd line is for territory, this stone should be on the 3rd line at K3.]
;W[gq];B[fd];W[bc]LB[ec:A]C[W: I want to secure the  corner but it looks now to  me that it is a bad move.  May be move 28 was a  mistake? And what about  playing A?

The smallest living group is 6 stones in the corner.  It takes 8 to live on the side, and 10 to live in the middle.  white still has access to side if he plays "a"  So black won't be able to live in the corner behind whites stones and so white should be able to kill anything black trys to put back there.  6 black stones for life +2 eyes + 6 white moves to match each black move is 14 spaces needed for black to live in the corner.  If white plays "a" I only see 15 spaces for black to get a living shape.  Thus Black should not be able to kill this corner nor live behind it.]
;B[ec]C[Ignoring blacks move threatens the corner though because now a black group can link to the outside and won't have to live in the corner.]
;W[ld]C[W: With next movements  I have tried to take the  center. It seems that it is  a bad decision. What do  you recommend at this  stage?

To take territory you need to enclose 4 sides.  In the corner you get 2 to start with, on the side you get 1, in the middle you get none.  In the current position white can't expect to get much of anything in the middle.]

(;B[lc];W[od];B[oc];W[md];B[nd];W[ne];B[oe];W[nf];B[cb]C[B: I  saw I could kill the W corner  group by playing here. Or are there  bigger moves?

This is huge];W[db]C[W: Is it possible to save this group  or it is too late?

see earilier variation for details.];B[dc];W[cc];B[bb];W[cr]
;B[br];W[aq];B[ap];W[es]C[W: What I have to play in this  situation?

When you see moves like this in a high level dan game, the stone are not intended to kill black nor to get life in the corner.  They are intended to set up a situation to maximize end game moves near G3 stone.  The white stone in the corner would have some latent aji G3 might be able to activate.  But at least white will make some end game profit by sacrificing the stone in the corner.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[fs];W[fq];B[er];W[qq];B[pr];W[of];B[kc]C[B: I  thought this was necessary so  that W could not invade the upper  side. Correct?

Not much white can do really P7 is bigger because then you push white down onthe side.  But a reducing move around P10 is good enough.  Black is winning by a large margin, and should not be looking for fights.  Slow and steady for black now.  Greed will turn this won game into a lost one if you aren't careful.]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[rc];B[qb];W[qc];B[pc];W[pe]LB[nl:a][lq:b][hd:c]
C[W: Unnecessary move.

Correct, it's only 1 stone and not even a full point because white will have to fill.  Surely there are bigger moves on the board.

Choose any of the suggested moves

"a" takes the side in a big way
"b" reduces black on the bottom
"c" prepares to pull some stunts to rescue white corner but at least reduce the top a bit if that fails.]
;B[ir]C[big move];W[bj]C[B: I feel that the next moves, 78 - 99,  were played rather clumsily on my  part. Could you give me one  possible variation?]

;B[cl];W[bl];B[cg];W[ah]LB[bg:A]C[W: Is it better to play A?

for what purpose?  Neither "A" nor the move you made will save the white stone on the top nor does it help you make life on the side]
;B[af];W[bm];B[fh];W[fi];B[jg];W[kf];B[oj]C[B: I thought now would be a good  time to invade.

This is a reduction not an invastion.  If you try to live on the side then it's an invasion.  You did a good job of finding the right point though.]
;W[nl];B[mj];W[ie]C[W: Is it a good defence?

What is it defending?  I don't know how to answer that question cause I don't understand the goal.]
;B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[hh]LB[hg:A]C[W: I think I lost game with this  move. Playing A might be  much better.

Game was lost a long time ago];B[hg];W[jh]C[W: Unfortunately I had to play risky  till the end of the game.]

Black has one.  Safe and steady should be the goal now for black, nothing risky.]
