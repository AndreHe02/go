RE[W+0.5]

C[Hello,

Thanks in advance for reviewing this game. We are interested in comments for both black and white.

We will prefix black's comments with R and white comments with C.

Best regards.

Hi, I'm Darrell, about 6 kyu AGA.  I'll preface my comments with D.  Overall, I'd say it was quite a good game.  Very close and well played.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]LB[qo:a][po:b]C[D:  At this moment, 3 stones are played on star points.  Normally the next play would be at 'a' or 'b'.  This is the biggest point on the board.  This is true for either black or white's next move.]
;B[jd]C[D:  Slightly unusual but not bad.];W[jq];B[po]LB[mq:a]
[lq:b][qj:c][dj:d]C[D:  Looks normal now.  There are 3 large areas on the board at the moment.  If I were white, I would play at 'a' as it greatly reduces the value of black's wall at q3-5.  Then the last two points go one white, one black.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pl]C[R: would have been better to play this stone on the third line?

D:  Yes.   Playing on the third line attacks white while making territory.  It is an attack because it cuts off one of white's avenues to make a base.  See variation.]
;W[qg]LB[re:a][rl:b][rd:c]C[C: I decided to get a relatively stable position here. Would it have been better at q14? I was afraid of an invasion at r12 or q12

D:  This was a good move.  If black had played on the third line, perhaps Q14 would make sense.  But here, this move gives you a completely stable group.  If threatened, you can extend to either 'a' or 'b'.  Even 'c' is possible under some circumstances.]
;B[fc]LB[lq:a]C[Good, but 'a' is better.  It makes use of the now 3 stone wall in the lower right.]
;W[df];B[fp]C[R: i expected d6 or e3. my intention was to escape to center and after that to reduce the left moyo at d10.]
;W[eo]LB[dq:a][cq:b]TR[jq][pl][po][pq]C[C: I think this was wrong, I should have extended to d6 instead. I was expecting black to defend his stone and play f5. I would have got some territory on the left side but black would have created a wall parallel with his 3 stones on the q line. Black might have got a better position anyway

D:  Yes, this is a funny move.  I'm not sure what the best way to punish it is.  I think 'a' is good because when black makes a base on the bottom, the marked white stone gets very weak sandwiched between the strong black group on the left and the wall on the right.  See variation.]

(;B[dk]C[R: after e5 i understood that to revive f4 will be very difficult, so i chose to use it as aji and get as much i can from the left teritory. where could i have gone from f4 (with g5 or f5)?]
;W[ci];B[co]C[R: would have been better e7 first?

D:  With white positioned so high (4-4 point and 5-5 point) black is invited to burrow underneath and make a base on the third row.  And black has nothing to fear from white gaining influence in the center as almost all of black's stones are on the 4th line (only one stone on the third line).    It is very natural for black to play on the third line here.]
;W[dm]LB[cm:a]C[D:  Again, white plays high (4th row).  Black should just play at 'a'.]
;B[dn]LB[cm:a]C[White could just descend here and split black.]
;W[en];B[cm];W[do];B[dl]
(;W[em]C[Should take!  See variation.];B[cn];W[hp]C[C: Should I have extended at n3 instead? Black's position in the q line was quite strong and I tried to stay away from it.

D:  Yes, I like n3.  This move is kind of overly concentrated with your wall.]
;B[kp]TR[jd][pd][dk][dl][pl]LB[lq:a]C[R: too close... now clearly f4 was left in opp teritory and the influence of white in center after f10 would have been decisive. so i tried to stay up.

D:  Black has many easy entrance points to the center, so white's influence is not really that intimidating.  A play at 'a' would have been normal and better here.

The sholder hit that you play here is generally used as a reducing move (to reduce opponent's territory).  Instead you want to stake out some territory.]
;W[kq];B[lq]LB[lp:a]C[D:  Has to be at 'a'.  Black has no hope of defending this cut.]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[mq];W[ko];B[ln];W[nq];B[np];W[mo];B[nr]
;W[cp]C[D:  Good move.];B[bp];W[bq];B[ao];W[go];B[no];W[jp]
;B[mn];W[rl];B[rn];W[db]LB[hc:a][dc:b][cc:c]C[C: I decided that this move was bigger once the s8-r10-r14 position is settled. Maybe playing r7 would have forced black to answer r6 and play d18 later.

D:  I like this move.  Threatens a move at 'a' and defends the corner.  I think a move at 'b' instead accomplishes the same things but leaves slightly less potential for a black invasion at 'c'.]
;B[ql];W[qk];B[qe]C[R: would have been better to play n17 now? i trusted in the strength of k16-f17, with r15 i tried to prepare a wall on line q.]
;W[nd]C[C: The next two moves stengthened black's position at the top and made the atack at q14 possible. I wanted anyway to break into black's large moyo at the top.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[pg];W[ph];B[le]LB[lc:a]C[D:  Too greedy I think.  Block white's base at 'a', and make some territory.  It is unreasonable to expect to kill this white invasion, but you should be able to proft from chasing it around the board while it struggles to live.  But if you let it slide under your position, you lose your territory and white gets a base and your stones on the top left are left without one.  "Make a fist before you attack."]
;W[lc];B[oh]C[R: would have been better to play o13? q13 stone is still weak, and there is not enough pressure on white group.

D:  previous move really created this problem.  You are left with no good move now as both white groups are]
;W[pi];B[ld];W[mc];B[kc];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[mf]C[C: Maybe this group could have survived if answering p18 but I didn't want to be shut in. Black would have gained a lot of influence towards the center.]
;B[ng]C[R: too late...];W[mg];B[cg]C[R: the white group escaped, my c7 group is not very strong, i decided to give up the center for the moment in order to assure the life of my group.]

(;W[dh]C[C: With this set of moves I tried not to let black escape towards the center, even if I would have lost some points of teritory. I wanted to use this thickness to atack f17.

D:  I'm not sure if black can live here.  But look at variation 2.]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[ch];W[cf];B[di];W[dg];B[bg];W[bf];B[cj];W[ag]
;B[ah];W[gd]C[C: With these moves I wanted to get a wall but black decided to give up teritory and gain influence in the center.]
;B[fd]C[R: i was pretty sure about the l16 group, i tried a pincer.]
;W[fe]C[R: with g17 i've been rennonced to any intention to the center?]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[he];W[gb];B[gc];W[hc];B[fb];W[ib];B[ff];W[ee]
;B[id];W[jb]LB[kb:a]C[Should be at 'a' to connect and have easy life.]
;B[cc]C[R: suicide atack :( anyway that side was about to be lost.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[da];B[be];W[af];B[ce];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[bb]

;W[fa];B[ia];W[eb];B[ha];W[ed];B[kg]C[C: The move I wanted to play for a long time but black was faster.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[mi];B[ni];W[lg];B[kh]C[R: for me it was clear that the white can not make more then one eye on top. There is a white side as goal for white group, i think in normal way i couldn't stop it, so i played arround it in order to mentain sente and create center teritory.]
;W[ki];B[nf];W[me];B[nj]C[R: if i would have played s13 first but i was afraid that white will escape to the center and make the conjunction with the n14 group. i would have lost the attack position]
;W[rf]C[C: I realised that my group is encircled and I had to get two eyed ASAP.]
;B[rh];W[re];B[rd];W[ri];B[qf];W[rg];B[rm];W[sk];B[lj]C[R: now the situation on the right is stable. would have been better an extenction at k7?]
;W[li];B[ji];W[kj];B[lk];W[jj];B[ii];W[jl]C[C: With all these moves I managed to save my upper-right group but black enlarged his teritory at k14 and o8. Was there any other choice? Cutting at g14 wouldn't have been possible because saving the n17 groups was quite urgent.]
;B[kn];W[jn];B[kp];W[lp];B[ik];W[jk];B[ij];W[hl];B[fh];W[fk]
;B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[hn];B[hm];W[gm]
(;B[fl]LB[gj:a][aq:b][lr:c][pa:d][in:e]C[R: would have been better to play g8? i didn't believe in the possibility to make teritory in g10 area, i tried to reduce the white space.

How about just 'a'?  It threatens h8 and secures territory.  Other sente moves marked.]
;W[gl];B[el];W[gj];B[ob]C[R: i had to choose between q9 and p18. i was not quite sure about the corner r17 group, so i choose to enforce it.

Good.  As a note, a move at q19 retains sente whereas this is gote.]
;W[nb];B[oa];W[na];B[pa];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[gg];W[hi];B[hh]
;W[sd]C[C: At this point the score was quite close. I had to get the best out of my end game. Every single point mattered.]

;B[oi];W[pj];B[ol];W[aq];B[kr];W[jr];B[ls];W[js];B[gi];W[hj]
;B[eh]C[R: probably here i lost that 0.5 points. the moves at e14 e10 can bring maximum 1 point, but with g12 i could resolve the whole matter at once.]
;W[hk];B[ef];W[de];B[ei];W[fj];B[mp];W[kp];B[fm];W[fn];B[od]
;W[nc];B[nk];W[ks];B[lr];W[ap];B[bo];W[in];B[ih]LB[gh:a]C[D:  looks unnecessary.  There's a point.  Just fill the ko.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[mj];B[km];W[kl];B[mk];W[la];B[ka];W[sm];B[sn]
;W[sl];B[sj];W[rk];B[ej];W[eg];B[fg];W[gh]C[C: Black was 0.5 points ahead but with two open ko's. He couldn't have won both of them. With this capture I got 0.5 points ahead.]
;B[eq]C[R: so i tried the impossible :) (to capture at least a white stone)]

D:  You're welcome.  Feel free to ask any followup questions you might have.  Hope it helps some.]

(;B[gj]))
(;W[dg]C[D:  Playing this way leaves you with fewer cutting points, which is good.  It builds a wall and the black groups on top and on the left are both going to be weakened severely even if black manages to live here.

I'm sure many variations are possible, but this one seems likely.]

;B[ah];W[aj]LB[hc:a]C[Dead.  And even if it lived, black has real problems with the other two groups.  A white move at 'a' for example is hard to deal with.  And the group on the left has only one eye.]
