AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, I'm ilfuria, your reviewer.
As instructed I'll review this game for the black side. 
I hope this review can help your go skills.
When needed, in the review, I'll start my comments with the tag
Ilfuria:];W[cn]C[Alcibaides [25k\]: hi, gl]
(;B[eo]C[ilFuria: I don't like this move much... It ensures no territory on the side or the corner whatsoever.
The center of the board has to be explored later. See variations to explore some ideas]
;W[en];B[gp];W[go];B[ho];W[fo];B[fp];W[do];B[ep];W[hn]
(;B[fn]C[ilFuria: I don't like this one. There's so many space where to play, three undisputed corners, and most of the sides are not challenged yet. It is not clear what black wants to accomplish by this move here.
The variations are better imo.];W[gn]
(;B[fm]C[ilFuria: see move 19 for further comments, then the variations]
;W[em];B[gm];W[hm];B[gl];W[hl]LB[fm:2][gm:3][fn:1]TR[jc][dh]
[qj][kp]C[ilfuria: moves from 14 to here are heavy and useless.
The point is that there are 4 major zones in which black can make points, marked with triangles.
The four marked stones neither make territory nor keep sente.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[gk];W[cp]C[ilF: see the branch for alternatives]

(;B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[bm];B[cq];W[ao];B[bq]C[ilFuria: Nice move]
;W[an];B[aq]LB[ar:1][as:2]C[ilFuria: this is kind ofan endgame move. It ensures only 2 more points while there is a huge part of the board still unexplored]

TR[km][kn][ko][kp][lp][lq]C[The cutting group has killed twowhite groups but, instead of playing a 1 stone capturing move you'd better focus on the huge lands on the right and up sides]
;W[mq];B[in]C[ilFuria: Well played];W[jn];B[jo];W[mr];B[im]
C[ilFuria: Useless move. The group was already dead. By playing this one you sacrifice sente. White can now try to make territory on the right side
To answer your concerns: there's no "large group to keep captive". If you have to you kill. Otherwise you leave it there and play more point-wise in some other point of the board]
;W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[os]
(;B[ps]C[ilFuria: Endgame move, too small. The corner is safe. think bigger.]
;W[ns];B[jr];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[ir]C[Alcibaides [25k\]: everything ok?

;B[rr];W[qn]C[ilFuria: The situation arisen by whitein this corner isn't that clear. I think that you shouldn't waste moves here but try to extend your control on the upper-right or the whole upper side]

;B[ri];W[sl];B[si];W[sm];B[sj]C[ilF: T10 is kind of an endgame move but you can play it since it is sente, menacing T6 and thecapture of the two white groups]
;W[rn];B[of]TR[pi][qi][ri][si][oj][pj][sj][ok][ol][pl][pm][on]
[pn][oo]C[I'd rather have played  Q11 to connect two weak groups with no eyes]
;W[pi];B[ph]TR[oj][pj][ok][ol][pl][pm][on][pn][oo]C[ilFuria: the marked group is now dead]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[lh];W[nn];B[mg]
;W[om];B[ng];W[oj]LB[pg:B][qh:A]TR[qg]SQ[ph]C[ilFuria: P12 isn't that good. Black should soon prevent the cuts at A and B, playing on the triangle spot, perhaps]

;B[se];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]C[ilF: 1) never use score estimator. Try to figure out hte score yourself.
2) There's an empty half board. The game is very far from the end]
;W[oa];B[qb];W[pa];B[na];W[rb];B[qa];W[pa];B[ra];W[ek];B[dh]
C[ilFuria: I'd have played on the upper side but here's ok too]
;W[di];B[fh];W[ei];B[eh];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf]CR[df]TR[cg]
[dh]C[ilFuria: you tend to play this form often. This is very very unstable and leaves  many cutting points.  you can exploit the same cutting points on the  opponent's formation or stabilize your position (next move withD14)]
;W[bi];B[af]C[ilFuria: your opponent has stabilized his formation. you are leaving behind two cutting points and making and endgame move worth wery few. White can still invade in the upper left corner and in the upper center where he will have plenty of room for two eyes]

[bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][qs][rs][ss]C[I think that you have to think more globally on the board.
you tend to do many "rookie mistakes" such as always respond locally to your opponent and never play large moves.

You should think at the largest and most urgent moves first. sometimes they involve fighting just as you did in the game. Some other times you'll play far from the battle.
Rememberthat playing contact and fights against a superior opponents is very dangerous :)

The circle-marked stone works well with the C handicap stone and makes the result better for black but white has sente and can attack B.]

The pincer esatblishes an outpost on the left side (even if a bit far from D).

Black can make territory on the lower side in exchange for this stone]

Black has many possibilities to develop the two marked stones.
The pincer variations are a bit complex so I prefer the lower-side developement variation but these are to be taken in account too.]
