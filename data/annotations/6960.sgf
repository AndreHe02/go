C[HI,
My name is Johanna Tuominen. I'm EGF 2 kyu from Finland.
I added some comments and variations through out the game. Hope my comments help. Enjoy the game of Go!]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]LB[dp:A][dq:B]C[JT: White could also play A or B.]
;W[od];B[dp]LB[cp:A]C[JT: I would Prefer black A instead.]
(;W[po]C[JT: See variation from node 5 (the previous one).]
;B[qo]C[JT: White could also think of playing Q4 to gain influence on the lower side. This joseki (see the variation) is quite tricky though as it is also known as the Great Avalanche joseki. I put two simple variations that would be good for white. 

The Joseki black selected in the game works well for black.]

(;W[qn]TR[qd]C[JT: I think this joseki slightly favors black because of the marked stone. White would like to get sente to approach the lower right corner, but getting it is difficult. I might have considered to play the Q5 approach to Q4.]
;B[qp]
(;W[pm]LB[pj:C][on:A][nq:B]C[JT: Black usually plays one these three.  The C is possible because black has R16 stone but it may end up to a difficult fight. See variations to A & C.]

(;B[mq];W[qi];B[qg];W[oi]LB[ql:A]C[JT: Safe play for white. Otherwise black A would give white poor result.]
;B[og]C[JT: I would have considered one of the presented variations.]

(;W[lc]C[JT: This is rather poor defence for white. Black plays either O17 or N17 causes problems for white. My point is that if you want to defend going towards the corner would be better, See variations from the previous node. 

Tenuki is also worth considering that is to approach the lower left corner. The P16 stone  is not totally lost as long as the corner is open.]

(;B[cf]C[JT: Big point for black. Direct pincer is worth considering for white.]

(;W[dl];B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[dh];B[ci];W[fh];B[eg];W[fj];B[fc]
C[JT: Nice double attack from black. White problems are caused by the side group that got out. See the variation from node 25.]

(;W[df];B[dg];W[fe]C[JT: The problem with this move is that you are driving black towards your weak stones (that is the marked stones do not have decent base). 

Maybe just living in the corner as a white. See variations from node 35.]

;B[gr];W[cq];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[er]C[JT: Black has possibility to kill white see the variations.]

(;B[bs]C[JT: This move also kills white :-) See the variations from node 76.]
;W[cs]
(;B[cr]LB[br:A]C[JT: Blacks mistake. Black A works for black. See the variations from previous node.]

TR[ip][jp][iq][jq]C[JT: If black plays shimari in the lower right corner then whicte can play for instance somewhere in the marked area. White prevents the optimal extension from shimari and causes pressure to the black corner stone in D4. The closer white plays to D4 the better it is locally to that corner but looking at the whole board situation black could replay by extendimg from his pincer around to L3or L4 which would be too good for black.]
