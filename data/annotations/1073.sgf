;B[pq];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[cf];W[gc];B[dj]C[This is not joseki for black.]

(;W[ep]C[White misses an opportunity to take territory in sente]
;B[do]C[This is not joseki, it puts no real pressure on white.  White should just settle his stone and wait to take advantage of the aji.]

(;W[dq];B[fn];W[eo]LB[hq:a][hp:b]C[This is a thank you move.  It can't possilby push through and it helps black get thicker.  Just take the side territory at "a" or "b"]
;B[en];W[dn]C[This cut is unreasonable.  The corner is still undecided and white doesn't have a base on the bottom.]

(;B[dm]C[Black cuts on the wrong side. but still it doesn't work for white

This line of attack should have waited for later in the game.  If white got to get some stones in on the top, then this fight would have gone very different for white.  As it is  white's stones has no friends and the fight is too hard.

Brute force is not the way to win a game.  white seems to resort to brute force often]

A High attack here would be better .  there is no room on the side to make a base for white.  White should be prepared to run away if he insists on jumping in like this.]

(;W[po]LB[oo:a]C[white is heavy now.  Better to move faster by jumping one space to "a"]

;W[mn];B[lo];W[on];B[kq];W[jq];B[kn];W[om];B[ol]LB[pl:a]C["a" is better.  White still doesn't have eyes and will make terriotry by chasing those stones.  Or will destroy any white might have gotten.]

;B[ef]C[The rest of the game is sealing off boards.  Whites group in the middle will be chased a bit, that only helps black.

White attacks too often without ever settling his groups.  White seems to want to deny black terriory everywhere by starting fights everyplace.  Once black gets settled White doesn't settle his own stones.   White needs to learn when an attack is profitable, and if it's not, then don't bother with the attack.  To have an attack fail is the same as making black solid and thick and leaving weakness behind to take care of.  Better not to attack at all and  just take territory.

What should try and only have 1 weak group on the board at a time.  And hopefully none.  If he ever has two, then he made a mistake]
