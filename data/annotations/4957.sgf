C[*X*: Hi, Chris.  My name's Alex.  I'm a Canadian 3d, but maybe a bit rusty because I haven't been playing as much lately as I should.  I think my theory is probably still solid enough to do a review, though.  I'll be prefacing my comments with "*X*" for Xopods, my usual username.

[Later\]: Having reviewed the game, I'd say that the best thing for you to do is to start looking more carefully for pivotal moves along the boundaries of your position and your opponent's.  Once you start seeing the board that way, you'll start to develop a better feeling for direction of play.

Aside from that, your biggest problems are with overconcentration and not knowing when to tenuki.  Late in the middle game, you also began to get too endgame-minded and overlooked more ambitious, position-expanding plays.

Dear Reviewer,

I played this game and felt out of control what was happening. I have been working on solidity and shape in my play, but I feel I was being pushed around too much.

In the end I won by half a point.

"Meta-Comments" would be much appreciated, i.e. what part of my game I should concentrate on improving; and how I should study. At the moment, I am replaying top level pro-games and solving a few tsumego a day (since I know my reading is still much too weak).

Thank you very much in advance for looking at this game.


Chris];B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qo]C[*X*: Okay, unusual opening for White, so you'll have to take into account her first two moves when playing your fuseki.  Conventional ideas may not work well.  Something Kobayashi-like might work well, since D3 can be pressed down and R5 is low with respect to the left side, but limits your ability to develop on the right.  Of course, D3 is not D4, so we're not talking about a straight Kobayashi fuseki here... but if you can look to stake something out on the left side and use an approach around E16 to complete it, that might be worth thinking about.]
;B[do]C[*X*: Good.  You're thinking the same thing.];W[co];B[cn]
;W[cp];B[dn];W[fp]C[*X*: This leaves very bad aji for White.  You'll be looking for a way to land a stone at or around H3 during the natural flow of play.]
;B[dj]C[*X*: Good, I think.  I'm always uncomfortable making the high move here, but I think you have to, since C16 is low.  Furthermore, exploiting the E3 weakness is likely to give you a weak White group to attack, so having a high stone is good.  You'll have to watch out for a submarine invasion at B8 though.]
;W[ed]LB[df:C][di:B][dm:A]C[Chris: Here I felt I should have played A and then B in the joseki at the bottom so I could answer calmly at C now. Is it correct that playing C now would leave me too thin?

*X*: Not too thin... but too many stones invested without a perfect territory... the twin weaknesses around D12 and B8 would make an invasion too easy.

Playing at A instead of D6 would have been one idea, though since White decided to play F4 instead of a joseki move, you're glad that you haven't left a peep to help her out.

I don't think this is bad for Black.  I'd probably want to attach at E15 now.]

(;B[gc]C[*X*: Pincer is okay, but see variation.];W[eb]C[*X*: Terrible decision for White.  Starting a fight is just what Black wants, with D10 and Q16 helping out.  Any other regular joseki move would be better than this; F15, most likely.]
;B[df]C[*X*: Well, you said you didn't want to play here before, since it's not quite close enough to D10, so why are you playing here now?  I'd defend the weaker side, somehow, and count on D10 to help out C16.  If White just presses down on C16 to move out, you get the Kobayashi-like result I mentioned earlier.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dd]C[*X*: No, absolutely not.  Don't make it so easy for White to make shape!]
;W[dc];B[bc]C[*X*: No, no, no.  At least play at E15!];W[bb]
;B[bd]C[*X*: This is tiny.  Your stones are in no danger, and White's can settle easily any time.]
;W[ee]C[*X*: This point was critical for both sides.

This sequence is the first thing you have to look at and learn from in this game.  It turned out very badly for you.]
;B[dg]C[Chris: Now that I look at this move, I feel it is slow and doesnt give me as much safety as I tought.

*X*: Well, now you sort of had to defend somehow.  It wasn't this move that was the problem as the three that came before it.

You're behind, now, though it's too early to say by how much.]
;W[hd];B[hc]LB[ic:A]C[Chris: I realise A would have been a lot better. I played this move too fast.

*X*: Tenuki might have been better still, since both sides are very solid nearby.  If you played around O17 instead of H17 or A, there would be little value for White in playing H17.  But yeah, A would be much better than H17.]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[kc];W[kd];B[lc];W[jq]C[*X*: Okay.  So, let's take stock of the situation here.  You have a lot of territory.  White has better control of the center.  On the plus side, the weak move at F4 has forced White to come back to the lower side to try to remove the aji (though there's still plenty of it left), instead of staking something out on the right, as she'd like.

You have to worry about R17, since it will make your position on the top side horribly overconcentrated and not worth much.  Meanwhile, the area around G6/G7 is going to be big for whoever gets there first, because it lies on the boundary between two frameworks (though yours is more like a territory than a moyo now) and aims at H3 for you, or B8 for White.]
;B[pq]C[*X*: Okay... I was thinking R14 maybe, but this is probably important, too.  Just try not to remove the aji at H3 in whatever sequence comes next.  And watch out for White trying to stake out anything too big on the right side in conjunction with the L16 stones.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq]LB[jq:32]C[Chris: I saw W32 and thought jumping would leave me a bit thin. This is why I nobi, to try and just live fast.

*X*: It's not so much about being thin as not wanting to give White forcing moves to help with the aji around H3.  I kind of like this move.]
;W[mq];B[mp]C[*X*: I think this is probably good... you want to aim at the aji around H3, not remove it, so this is better than crawling.]
;W[lq];B[mo];W[pp];B[rq]C[*X*: Is this better than R3?  I'm terrible at tactics in the corner, but I think I'd play R3.]
;W[ko]
(;B[on]C[*X*: Too aggressive.  I'd just jump out.  If White plays on the right, you can be the first to get a move in around G7.  See variation.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rs]C[*X*: Surely there's a better way to live?  P2 or something?  I have no idea, though... I hate the corners.]
;W[pm];B[mm]C[Chris: Any comments about how to handle this weak group (or if I should have avoided it) would be much appreciated.

*X*: Since you jumped out anyway, did the P6/Q7 exchange help you or White more?  I'm pretty sure it helped White.  You've probably lost half a move or so.  This is a good idea to think about in order to improve... you should have foreseen the need to jump out to N7 eventually and asked yourself whether exchanging P6 for some White response on the right side would help you or White.]
;W[om]C[*X*: Relatively useless.  White gives your half move back.]
;B[mk]C[*X*: Well... a one space jump is never bad, but I don't know if reinforcing this group is really the right idea.  I think you want to play around G7, reaching out to your weak stones from a distance, while inducing White to protect herself on the lower side, thereby making your cutting stones less important and letting you treat them lightly.]
;W[nl]
(;B[kn]C[*X*: Hmm.  After White answers this, she's less likely to answer a move around G7.  I thought about L7, but the more I think about it, the more I think this may  be one of those cases where you just want to connect to a peep.  N8 certainly does make you look strong in the centre... imagine then that you get a move around G7 in sente...

See variation];W[jo];B[kk]C[*X*: Nice shape, anyway.  I don't know who's winning.  There are several big points still left on the board]
;W[qi]C[*X*: Weak move, too close to White's own stones.];B[qg]
C[*X*: I don't think you need to approach so closely... White is thick here, so holding back to R14 for a stronger effect on the corner might be better.

You might not even want to play here at all.  If White approaches at R14, you can footsweep at R15 and take the corner, or just jump to O16.

Now we're getting into the stage of the game where both you and White overlook the G6 region again and again, while it continues to become larger and large.  This is the most important thing to study in this game.]
;W[li]C[*X*; I think this is the wrong direction.  You can try to build up your moyo as you run.]
;B[ki];W[lj];B[kj];W[lk];B[ll];W[ml];B[kl]C[*X*: Look a the sort of territory you're quite possibly going to be making if you get to play around G6.]
;W[lh]
(;B[pc]C[*X*: G6 area is much bigger.];W[dk]C[Chris: This felt a bit like overplay, but I have no idea what to do against it.

*X*: Well, it's overplay, but you still have the aji at B8 to worry about, since you never played in the all-important G6 area.]

(;B[ck]C[*X*: If you're going to play hane, you should know ahead of time what you're going to do if White crosscuts, since it's inevitable that she'll either to that or C8.

If you aren't comfortable handling a crosscut, you should just play C10 and accept D9 as kikashi.]
;W[cj]
(;B[di]C[*X*: Wrong extension. See variation.];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl]
;B[dl];W[ak];B[bj];W[bi];B[ek];W[aj];B[ci];W[bn]
(;B[bm]C[Chris: I was hoping for some trouble in the corner...

*X*: Always cut the side you don't want.  Clearly, capturing White's stones on the left would be good, so if you're looking to stir something up, play B5, not B7.]
;W[cm];B[bh]C[*X*: This is too small.  You've only got about 8 points of territory here, so this is in the cataegory of large endgame.  G6 is bigger than ever now.]
;W[im]C[*X*: Now you've lost the territory on the left, have no moyo, and have a weak group under attack.  White should win this game, now.  I'll be interested to see how you eke out a half point win.]
;B[hp]C[*X*: Ugh.  Well, desperate times call for desperate measures, I suppose... if White's overplay payed off, maybe yours will too.]
;W[go];B[eq];W[ep];B[dp];W[cq];B[fq]

;B[gr];W[jr];B[fs]C[*X*: Okay, tit for tat, it's a game again.]
;W[am]C[*X*: I don't understand this move.  I guess White doesn't want you to hane at C1, but C1 is sente for her, so why doesn't she just play there?  Maybe she thinks you'll defend your four stones.]

(;B[ri]C[*X*: The other attachment, on top, is worth thinking about, but I don't think it works.]

*X*: Well, the game ended kind of badly, with both of you pulling off one bad invasion, and then an unnecessarily huge ko.  There were some interesting situations earlier on, though.  The main thing to take away from this is that you were both overlooking the pivotal region of the board, around G6/G7.]
