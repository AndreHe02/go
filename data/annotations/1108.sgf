;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[dq];B[kd];W[fc]C[ug: It is better to approach from the other direction, by C14.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[cf]C[ug: I would prefer D14, since it is more useful in attacking the white stones.]
;W[ic];B[do]C[ug: Black should play K18 or something like that instead. That would attack
the white group and strengthen black's stones. Omitting this
move allows white to settle his group easily, for example by L18..]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[gq]C[ug: This is a little thin. The usual move is F3.]
;B[dj];W[pf];B[od]C[Is this move ok?
What should I do in this situation?

ug: I think this move is ok; but do you see how desirable it would be to have a
stone at K18 now?];W[mc];B[md]C[ug: Another approach, which results in a difficult fight, would be to separate
white's groups by L17 or L18.];W[kb];B[nc];W[mb];B[qn]C[ug: Now that you have build some kind of wall, you should attack the white stone  at Q14 instead, with Q10 for example.
After the corner approach, white can combine a pincer  with an extension from this stone.]
;W[ql]C[ug: Maybe a pincer at Q9 or R10 is better, in view of the stone at Q14.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pq]C[ug: I think this is the wrong direction. See the variation.]
;B[qp];W[po]
(;B[pr]C[ug: This helps white more than black. Why not play the usual joseki?
See the variation.];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[pn];W[on];B[jp]C[I know that this is bad move.  Is g5 better?

ug: I don't think this move is so bad. But maybe you still should try to  attack the Q14 stone.]
;W[gn];B[jn];W[qi]C[ug: This is very nice for white.];B[om]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[pm];B[qm]C[ug: This doesn't help black, black merely loses a liberty.]
;W[pl]
(;B[mn]C[ug: Black must try to connect his two groups. Thus N7 might be better.]
;W[mm];B[ok];W[mo];B[ln];W[lo];B[ko];W[ml];B[nk]C[ug: Now black has two weak groups.]
;W[kl];B[km]C[ug: I would prefer J7.];W[lm];B[kn];W[jl];B[im]
C[ug: As you play J7 now anyway, it looks as if you had exchanged L7 for K8;
this is of course a very good exchange for white.];W[il];B[hm]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[gm];W[fm];B[fl];W[gk];B[fn];W[em];B[en]
;W[fk];B[el];W[ek]
(;B[dm]C[ug: D8 instead would be better];W[dk];B[pj]C[ug: Black should escape, with P11 for example, right away.]
;W[qj];B[qk]C[ug: This only helps white.];W[rk];B[pk];W[rm]
;B[qo]C[ug: S6 looks better for black; but this whole manoeuvre helped white
quite a lot, and weakened black.];W[li];B[nh]C[ug: As we will see later, this is very thin.]
;W[nf];B[of]C[ug: I'm not sure if this move is a good idea.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[oe];B[mf];W[me];B[le];W[ne];B[lg];W[nd];B[pe]
;W[of];B[oc];W[ld];B[qf];W[qg]
(;B[ph]C[This move was bad too. How should I play in this situation?

ug: You must connect the P9 and the O12 stones. Maybe N11 would be a good way to do
this. Of course, it will be hard to make life for this group, but I think black
cannot win the game if white gets to capture the P9 stones.]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[pg];W[md];B[ni];W[nj];B[mj];W[oj];B[mk]
;W[mi];B[lk];W[ll]
(;B[ki]C[ug: L10 might be more interesting for black. See the variations.
Nevertheless, it is certainly a difficult game for black now.]

;W[rj];B[ke];W[sp];B[so]C[ug: T3 looks better for black.];W[ro]
;B[rn];W[sn];B[rp];W[sq];B[so];W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[ug: You should resolve the ko instead. (In fact, T7 is pretty much sente for black,
since it threatens to rescue the P9 group.)];W[ro];B[np];W[no]

(;B[op]C[ug: why not S3?];W[mp];B[so];W[pa];B[rq];W[qb]
(;B[bo]C[ug: Maybe B6 is better, since black can then probably keep sente.   -------- End of Review ------------------------------
