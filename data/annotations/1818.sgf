C[gounter: Here's a game i played on igs in which i'm black
I lost by 13.5 points, but i feel i could have won this game if i didn't let white expand so much
on the right side/corner.

Thanks for your time


bignose: Black's main failing in this game was to attack White while his own groups were still weak, and "playing the opponent's game for him" by making pushes too early, thus causing White's groups to become settled while Black's groups were left weak.

Remember that the purpose of attacking a group is not to kill it, but to force it to fall back and live while your group becomes strong and your territory expands.  (Many groups *do* die when attacked, but this is not something that should be expected; the attack should gain benefits even if the group lives.)  This was how White managed to expand so easily; his group was in no real danger when Black attacked, and Black's surrounding groups were weak, thus all White had to do was expand from an already-living group by pressing at Black's weak points.

When you have a choice of attacking a group, stop first and examine each of your own groups.  Are they weaker than the surrounding opponent's groups?  If so, a simple strengthening of your own weak point can be a potent way of threatening the opponent, since now *his* group can be attacked more easily.

Black also made many small reading errors in the late mid-game and end-game; if Black had kept the one or two points lost by each of these reading errors, then he may have won the game by ten points instead of losing by ten.

I would recommend spending a certian amount of time each week doing simple life-and-death problems; even easy ones will help, so long as the habit of reading is practiced, thus making small reading errors less common during the game.]

(;B[jd]C[bignose: This move, played on the top centre while the top right corner is not yet secure, invites a White invasion (which was in fact White's next move).  There's nothing wrong with this, since your position is strong enough to welcome White's invasion, but it seems inconsistent with your response when White does invade.

To keep the top corners, as it seems you want to, Black should have spent this move in the top right and allow White to play here on the top side (see the variation).

Expecting to keep both corners, *and* the top side, safe in an even game is rather greedy :-)]
;W[nd]
(;B[oc]C[bignose: White's invasion is an opportunity to harrass a group and gain some territory.  This is not the way to do it; playing a stone right next to a group makes it stronger, not weaker.  As we see from the game, White gains a solid position while Black is forced to abandon the corner and run to the side.

See the variation for a better response to this invasion.];W[od]
;B[pd];W[nc];B[pg]LB[pb:a]C[bignose: Oops.  Black's corner is too weak to extend now; a play is needed at 'a' or similar to protect the cut.

If White approaches around 13 in response to Black protecting the corner, Black can tenuki by invading the bottom side, and will still be able to invade the right side also.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[oe];W[qn]LB[pj:A][jp:B][dj:C]C[gounter: are white's tight moves in the bottom coherent with her 4-4 stones ?
If i were playing white, i would probably try to extend these 4-4 stones on a large scale instead (A, B or C)
But it seems they worked pretty well in the game as they are
I'm not sure whether they secure the corner though

bignose: Whites keima moves in the bottom corners are a standard way to secure the corner from a 4-4 stone.  It is not as strong as the same keima move from a 3-4 stone, but it still keeps White's options open and helps against the big vulnerability of a 4-4 stone: the 3-3 invasion.

A play on the star point would certainly be a good move for White, but they are not the only options; the moves White has chosen mirror Black's strategy by concentrating on securing the corners.]
;B[dj];W[qj]LB[rh:a][ql:b][qh:c]MA[pg]C[gounter: good for white : i don't want to block at 'a' (and he will eventually play there himself).
Maybe i could have made it harder for white with 'b'?

bignose: Yes, this is a good extension for White.  Black's own extension (marked stone) along the right side is now shown to be too narrow; from a two-stone wall, a three-point extension to 'c' is better, and would be far preferable in this position.]
;B[lc]LB[jp:a]C[bignose: This is poor timing; playing in an undeveloped area should take precedence over a slight increase in territory.

Black should worry more about the lower side becoming a huge White moyo.  The point 'a' is a huge play for either player at this point.]
;W[ne];B[of];W[mb];B[lb];W[qb];B[jp]C[bignose: Note that attacking the White group on the upper side, and forcing White to make it stronger, has weakened Black's right side group; White will now have an advantage in the fight on the lower side.]
;W[lp];B[gp];W[ck];B[cj];W[dk];B[eq]LB[ek:a][ej:b]C[bignose: Again, the lower Black group is not in any particular danger at this point, so a play there is somewhat wasteful while there are other fights still to resolve.

"Hane at the head of two stones" is a standard proverb.  A Black play at 'a', or a White play at 'b', would swing the game tremendously at this point.]
;W[dq]
(;B[oj]C[gounter: i thought a white move here would be terrible for black

bignose: Yes, this is an important point for both players; White would gain large influence on the lower right by playing here, whereas Black now easily avoids being trapped.

However, still the play on the left (see variation) is much bigger at this time.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[di];B[ci];W[dh];B[ch];W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[fj]
;W[gh];B[gd]C[bignose: In a larger sense you can regard Black's reduced position as resulting from White's hane on the left.]

C[gounter: Now i don't know where to play
Maybe it would have been better to invade at 'a' or 'b' now to prevent white from getting too much
territory in the bottom right ? (i will invade at 'b' later in the game)
In comparison, my move in the middle seems small as white's top group is somewhat settled
I also thought of continuing to keep white separated with 'c' but there is still the top white group to connect to

bignose: A principle to remember: If you invade, your invading stone will come under attack.  Therefore your surrounding groups must not be susceptible to attack, or you will have two (or more!) groups to defend at once.  In this case, a Black invasion at 'a' requires the top left group to be strengthened; a Black invasion at 'b' requires the bottom group to be strengthened.

The push at 'c' is the "only move on the board"; keeping White separated is an excellent tactic for Black.  White cannot defend both these centre groups at the same time, and Black will profit from attacking either one, so forcing White to decide with the splitting move at 'c' is too important to miss.]

(;B[if]LB[gf:a]C[gounter: maybe something like 'a' is better, white will probably fight
(please see my variation)

bignose: This move is fine, it threatens White while making your borders more secure, exactly what you want.  Your variation leads to complex fighting, which is not what you want in this area.  See variations for more comments.]
;W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[fd];W[ee];B[dd];W[de];B[df];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[ef];B[cf];W[ed];B[ec]C[bignose: Black has secured large territory on the top and left, which White has struggled to keep a thin group in the centre.  This is certainly the way Black wants the game to go.]
;W[rg]C[bignose: This is the payback for Black's large gains in the top and left; White now has sente to attack here on the right.]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[pj];W[qk];B[np]LB[qf:a][re:b]C[bignose: White has made gains on the right side at the expense of Black's top right; this move is too early, as White can afford a large loss here if he can dgain the whole top right corner.

Black still need another move at both 'a' and 'b'.  Black's bottom group is also vulnerable.

Attacking while your own nearby groups are weak is inviting disaster.  It is for this reason that often the best way to threaten a group is to first make your own nearby group stronger.]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[mq];B[ml]LB[oq:a][jr:b][qf:c]C[gounter: better to continue invading with 'a'?

bignose: Definitely not.  Go too deep and White will cap at 117; you then have *three* weak groups and White will have a picnic.

At this point White is not in any real danger; her right side is secure and her three stones on the bottom can easily connect to the centre group.  She will be waiting for an opportunity to play around 'b' or 'c', turning the attack back on Black.]

;W[fp];B[dr];W[ep]LB[es:a][gr:b]C[gounter: I played the previous moves with the idea of 'a', but the white cut at 'b' looks dangerous

bignose: Yes, Black's group is too weak to keep cutting like this; connecting at 'b' is necessary.]
;B[gr];W[es];B[jn];W[go];B[ho];W[hn]C[bignose: Note that it took very little pressure on the bottom Black group to gain White a lot of territory in the bottom right corner.  Strengthening the Black group earlier could have prevented this.]
;B[io];W[jm];B[lr];W[mr];B[kp];W[lo];B[mn];W[on];B[pm];W[pn]
;B[om]LB[ql:a]C[bignose: Pushing at 'a' is a better threat; separating White's groups could still reduce her territory significantly.  Your stones can still connect if White pushes at 147.

This move shows a lack of appreciation for the proverb "There is no territory in the centre".  It takes a lot of effort to surround even a small territory in the centre; these moves are better spent creating or destroying territory on the side or corners.]
;W[qm];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[qg];B[ph]LB[nf:a]C[bignose: Not needed.  If you're worried about the possibility of a cut here, solidify the outside with a move at 'a', which has the bonus of threatening White also.]

;W[fe];B[fc]LB[gc:a][ik:b]C[bignose: Many points can be lost, one by one, by wasted moves in the endgame.  Be sure to read out the cut to see if protecting it would be necessary; in this case a White cut at 203 would fail when Black played 'a'.]
;W[am];B[dk]C[gounter: at this point, the score seems to be pretty even (white wins by 0.5)]

;W[jr];B[hq];W[is];B[jq]LB[hr:a]C[bignose: Oops.  Beware letting White capture a stone inside a small territory like this; ko or seki can easily result.  Simply connecting at 'a' avoids the complications.]
