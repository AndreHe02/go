;B[pd]C[Note for the reviewer :

I played black.
I lost this game (2.5 points) though I thought I had the lead before middle game.
Question is : why ? And what should i concentrate on ?
Thanks in advance

Hi,
I am piaf (7k IGS) and I will analyse this game for both sides.

(Comment: The original review was done in french, translation by the Morten of the GTL)

Bonjour,
je suis piaf (7k igs) et je vais analyser cette partie pour les deux camps.



---

After the last node I have added a small conclusion of the performance of black.]
;W[dq];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qk]
(;B[qm]LB[qi:a]C[Recently advised by very strong (dan level or so) player
I don't know whether the really strong players play this move, but it seems natural.


Je ne sais pas si les très fort joueurs jouent ce coup, mais il parait naturel.


---
I would play at [a\] myself (see the variation). Even though, if white answers one point above [a\] as white should, black can harass white stones from the other direction as well, I think the move I suggest is betteras the the move black played violates a basic go principle: never play close to thickness, and the corner enclosure is very thick at the moment.]
;W[qf]LB[qh:a][pi:b][of:c]C[
The extension seems a bit long and permits black to cut violently.

L'extension parait un peu longue et permet à noir de couper violament

---

This is indeed too greedy. Simply [a\] is best even though it allows black to play r14 (where white played in the actual game).

In this position black can immediately invade as white is way too thin. The proper point for invasion is not easy to see - I would probably play at [b\]. I would not play at the third line as white would then play [c\] forcing black to jump wih his corner stone and then attack the invading stone.]

(;B[qe]C[This is a very bad move. It does not protect the corner well, it does not attack white - just the opposite, it helps white to strenghten his weak stones.]
BM[1];W[pf]C[Now it is much harder for black to attack the white group in the right hand side. White is still a bit thin though and needs to add a stone soon.]
;B[nd]
(;W[pj]C[
Yes, white can be satisfied with the result. I think that Q11 would be better because a black attack at R12 is still possible.

oui, blnc peut etre satisfait du résultat. Je pense que Q11 était meilleurs car une attaque noir en R12 est toujours possible.


---

The move played is better than the option described above. R12 is not possible as claimed above after white defends like this. Also it is a good idea not to become overconcentrated - if the move played were one line higher, it would be slightly too close to the two white stones that can now be called thickness. Also Q10 is a bit thicker shape than Q11 giving a better position towards the center.

Anyhow, white can now be satisfied with the local result.]
(;B[dj]LB[do:a]C[
Yes, there are some important points left.

oui, il reste des points importants.


---

This is not a good move.

In fuseki (the opening) the biggest moves are usually corner enclosures and approach moves. Splitting moves like this are not severe and should be used is approach moves are not good.

The best move instead is probably [a\].];W[cn]C[White is happy to play this move as it is huge.]
;B[cf]SL[dj]LB[fc:a][lc:b]C[Wrong side. As the marked stone is high, it can easily run into the center for safety, so there is no need to play this move. Also the marked stone has no enemy stones nearby so defending it is not necessary at this time.   Instead, the best move is probably [a\], especially since white [b\] would be too good to allow.]
;W[fc]
(;B[bd]LB[iq:a]C[This is an aji-keshi (a potential destroying move). Instead black should play tenuki (elsewhere), perhaps at [a\], or possibly the variation.]
;W[cc]
(;B[df]SL[dj]LB[ck:a][ci:b]C[Anything wrong with this ? I wanted to
strengthen the shape, but I lose sente

Yes, indeed, this is not optimal.

oui effectivement, cela n'est pas optimal.


---

This is a very slow move. Something like [a\] would be more positive. Regarless of the move, black stones have a funny shape as the marked stone should be at [b\].]
;W[gq]C[
Too short. You must be more ambitious.

trop court. Il faut viser plus large.

---

This is way too close to the white corner enclosure. Just below the star point is the best point here.]
;B[jq]C[oui

---
Now black gor the big point. Playing here is in my opinion better than the move one point to the left. It is always a good idea to stay away from thickness, no matter to whom it belongs to.]
;W[qc]LB[lc:a][nc:b]C[
Too early, you should take the large point at K16 or K17.


trop tot, il faut déjà prendre le gros point en K16 ou K17

---

This is too early indeed. [a\] instead is the best move. White has no reason to pull back at K16 or K17 as he is solid in the top left corner. Black can hardly do anything but answer at [b\] - this secures the corner, but white has now time to play at the top star point to make shape.]

(;B[pc]LB[re:a][qd:b]C[No good. This is usually only played if one needs eyes. Now it is just too passive. White is still a bit thin below, so [a\] would be the best move here, and funnily, the bad shape of [b\] would be the second best choise. [a\] would allow white to live small in the corner while black would undermine the below white position and build thickness.]
;W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc]LB[rb:a][rg:b]C[Aji remaining in this position: white can start an endgame ko by playing at [a\], while black can play peep at [b\]. Neither move should be played until there isa good reason to do so, so timing is difficult.]
;W[fn]LB[cl:a][lc:b]C[Was this worth preventing ?  and how/when ?

I don't see the importance of this move. There is still K16 or K17.


Je ne comprends pas la portée de ce coup. Il reste toujours le point K16 ou K17.


---

I see no purpouse for this move. What does it accomplish?   Better moves are [a\] and [b\] (because of the corner ko potential black has little eyeshape to attack approaching stones).

[a\] may look small, but it is rather sente and protects the corner a bit.]
;B[jc]SL[dj][df][cf][bd]LB[cl:a][rb:b]C[Up to there, I count more territory for B than for W. Am I wrong ?
Yes! Nice move.

You cannot really count territory at present. Everything can be invaded, it's a question of finding the right way.
However, you can easily count the weak and strong groups:
- The South-West white corner is strong, the North-West white corner is very weak, the white East side is strong.
- The black South-East corner is strong, the black North side is strong, the black west side is weak. The black stone at D14 is a bit useless.
Result:
- Black should put pressure on the white north west corner to construct territory or influence
- White should put pressure on the West group to construct.

Oui ! Bon coup.
On ne peut pas compter en terme de territoire dès a présent. Tout peut s'envahir, c'est une question de moyen.
Par contre, on peut facilement compter les groupes faibles et les groupes forts :
- le coin Sud-Ouest Blanc est fort, le coin Nord-Ouest Blanc est très faible, le coté Est Blanc est fort.
- le coin Sur-Est Noir est fort, le coté Nord Noir est fort, le coté Ouest Noir est faible. La pierre D14 est un peu inutile.
Bilan :
- Noir doit faire pression sur le coin Nord Ouest Blanc pour construire du territoire ou de l'influence
- Blanc doit faire pression sur le groupe Ouest pour construire.


---
The move played was one of the two possibilities. The other one was [a\] securing the marked stones with funny shape.

All the groups on the board are stable at this time - all the groups are very safe.

Territorywise the game is quite close. Black has a nice little double wing formation on the bottom and some territory at the top, however as white can still play [b\], the corner is not yet blacks. White has a large bottom left corner, and some territory in two other places. If white had komi, I would even say white is ahead, but as he did not have it, the game is even as white has sente.]
;W[bc]C[
Yes. Defence and attack at the same time - that's ideal.

Oui. Défendre et attaquer en meme temps, c'est l'idéal.

---

A good move. Secures white while makes lots of territory.]
(;B[be]LB[cl:a]C[A bad move. This is slow, small and unnecessary. One should have protected the group by playing at [a\].]
;W[in]LB[kp:a][jo:b]C[
No, this move gives black the chance to reinforce the south side.


Non, ce coup laisse à Noir le temps d renforcer le coté Sud


---

This is a move I have no clue why it was played. Itis almost totally wasted move and allows black to make secure territory by playing at [a\], orperhaps even at [b\].]
;B[jo]C[
Yes.

Oui];W[jn];B[ko]C[White is helping black. Now black has a huge territory in the bottom right while white gained practically nothing in exchange as there are no weak black groups to attack with this white wall.]
;W[kn]C[
Unlike Black, White doesn't gain anything in this exchange.


Blanc ne gagne rien dans cette manoeuvre, contrairement à Noir.]

(;B[jj]LB[lo:a][ln:b]C[No reason to play here. What does this move do? Not any territory, nor it is connected to anything, it just sits there waiting to be attacked. Instead just playing at [a\], or at [b\] is better). I would play [b\] - see the second variation.]

(;W[hc]SL[jj]LB[lo:a][fj:b]C[This is slow and small. The hand at [a\] is better. One can also consider moves like [b\], cutting the marked lone black stone from distance and attacking it.]

;W[ol]SL[jj]C[I thought W was not building much
territory here, because I could use K10

No, this white move is not good.

Non, ce coup Blanc n'est pas bon.


---
This white move achieves nothing and is very gote.

Black should never had played the marked stone which has only one purpouse: it is a target for attack sitting way too close to strong enemy position.]

(;B[mk]C[
No, it's sufficient to expand and to strengthen in C8.


Non, il sufft de s'aggrandir et de se sécurisé en C8


---

Aji-keshi. Black might have wanted to cut here later. This peep is also not sente. White can easily ignore it and attack the two black stones from distance.]

Useless connection.

Which purpose does this move serve?

---

Yet another purpouseless move giving the opponent the excuse to play at [a\] preventing the white slide at [b\]. However for black playing [c\] is most important. Also imprisoning the lose white stone by playing [d\] is very big.]

---
What black had done with the last few moves is helping white. Now the marked stones look really weak and as there is a new weak black group on the board as well (the stones black just played).]
;W[hi];B[gk]SL[mk][lk][ij][jj]C[The situation for black improves.

Above is of course false. Black has not some seriously weakened stones in the center and as white can press against the top black group to gaim more power the future for the marked stones looks dim.]

No reason to cut here. Instead white should have attacked the black stones as one group. I would have played at [a\] I guess.]
;B[ih];W[hh]SL[ih]C[The variations are complicated.

---
White missed the correct move ealier (where the marked black stone is) and the attack is getting weaker as white has now three weak stones to look after.]

(;B[jh]LB[kk:a]C[A simple move which keeps the pressure on the white group.

Un coup simple qui garde la pression sur le groupe Blanc.

--

The best move. Increases the number of liberties of the black group, makes the cut of [a\] realistic and now the three white stones are almost dead.]
;W[hg];B[he]SL[ik][jk][jl]LB[kk:a]C[Yes.

Oui.


---

Keeping white separated is a good idea. However as black is still leading and as white can not connect with one move (white h15 wouldnot connect - black could still play for example h14 later on), black should consider a simple move of [a\], which would allow black to capture the single cutting stone (as white would need to protect the marked stones), and would allso black to take sente.

In principle, however cutting the escape route of weak enemy stones is a good idea.]
;W[if];B[kg];W[kf];B[kk]LB[lf:a]C[Now hane of [a\] would be better move to play first, when cut here. After that white would still need to save the weak group giving black time to fix upper side and make endgame profit.]

No. In order of priority:
- If there's a geta, play it

- Otherwise reinforce.


non.
Dans l'ordre des choses :
- si un geta est possible joue le
- si un shicho est possible sans geta en vue, joue le

---

The hane of [a\] is the best move here. After the hane [b\] would capture the white stone in more efficient way and in better shape. Actually After [a\] black could play an efficient move of [c\] to alsoprotect the cutting point while capturing the marked white stone.]

(;W[lg]SL[kk][lk][mk][lj]C[Now white grabbed the initiative and black is in trouble. It is hard to see how black can live now. Black was overly cncerned with the marked stones and forgot the proper direction of play.]
;B[lh];W[je];B[id]SL[lj][lk][mk][kk][jj][ij][ih][jh][kg][lh]
C[Black has no time to play moves like this. Also black does not realize that it is not he who is attacking but white who is about to kill all the marked black stones.]

Black and white playe well. During the Chuban (middle game), black played beter moves. However, in the Yose (endgame) white made an extraordinary comeback. Both players are better than 16/17k IGS, it seems to me that 12k would be more appropriate :-)

Good luck,

Noir est Blanc ont bien joué. Dans le Shuban (milieu de partie), les coups Noir étaient meilleur. Par contre, dans le Yose (fin de partie), Blanc a pris un ascendant extraordinaire.

-----

Blacks main errors were:

Strenghtening the opponent and playing too close to thickness, and ignoring weak groups.

Also the endgame of black was very bad. Not just the blunders which cost a few stones, but also elsewhere. You should improve your endgame as it is rather easy to win or lose even 20 points or more at your level in endgame alone.

In fuseki (opening) you should play more vigorously, although the fuseki was reasonable for you level. The problem with studying fuseki is that it is impossible to study fuseki much without good reading skills and good sense of what is big and what is small. One priciple is to try to play the moves that are big for both players (I call them double territory moves).

If I were you, I would improve reading ability first - after all it is the first basic skill needed to play this game. The second area of improvement would be the endgame.   I hope this review helps you improve your game. Good luck in future games!

To the original reviewer:

Your problem seems to be that you give your opponent too many ponnukis. If a stone is in atari, usually the best idea is not to sacrifice the stone and try something fancy, but to play in a simple way and save the stone. Going after complicated variations tend to backfire unless the reading skills of the player are bulletproof and I can assure you that even I at IGS 1K or 2K level make lots of errors both in reading and judgement if I try to make some complicated variations work. Choosing the simple move always seems to work much better!

Another thing I noticed was the tendency of not answering to tsuke (a contact move) - one almost always has to answer a tsuke directly. Only if the tsuke threathens something indirectly (for example it is a ladder block), should one consider playing elsewhere.]

The above slightly incorrect: there are no weak black groups, just weak white stones surrounded by lots of black stones - it is 5 - 2 advantage for black on this side of the board.   Regarding this variation, I would play at [a\] instead of the move played were I black.]

This is incorrect. Black had all the advantages on this side of the board thus the result not good enough for black. White was able to connect the two loose stones too easily.
