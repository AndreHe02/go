E: So after my initial cursory run through the game, I see two ideas to bring to your attention: 1) In a handicap game, you may want to respect that your opponent will likely be able to read out a fight bettter that you - this should lead you to play more conservatively, and to engage in fights only reluctantly.  Use the handicap stones.  2) You prefer to hane in most situations.  Sometimes this is good, sometime not.  Also consider other choices.

E: I notice that you said the game ended on time.  Generally, this is not the best to have reviewed, because you want to focus on improving your play, and I have not way in the review to know when you play was considered, and those cases where you were rushed by time.

E: Black move 116 wins the game.  Great move.];B[ce];W[cd];B[cj]
CR[de]TR[ce]C[mattos [15k\]: this is my last game

E: This is an unusual response that makes the marked stone very week.  D15 is the standard response.]
;W[cg]C[mattos [15k\]: i go to bed
mattos [15k\]: :)];B[cn]CR[de][cm]C[B1ackW01f [18k\]: fair enough :)

E: Consider the marked spaces are probably better.];W[oc]C[E: Very aggressicve approach by white.  Not unusual in a handicap game.]
;B[pc]C[E: Good response locally.];W[od];B[pe]CR[oe]C[E: "Hane at the head of two"]
;W[oe];B[pg]CR[of]C[mattos [15k\]: where are you from
mattos [15k\]: ?

E: The hane is still good here.];W[kc]C[B1ackW01f [18k\]: sydney australia, you?
mattos [15k\]: :)
mattos [15k\]: Lublin in Poland
mattos [15k\]: thank zou

E: very conservative by white.];B[gc]CR[gd][de][ee]SQ[dc][kc]
[oc][cd][od][oe]C[E: You should consider that these two groups, marked, will probably live.  So, your invasion should be to reduce territory, not so deep.  See other potential plays.]
;W[fc];B[ge]CR[gd]C[E: the one space jump will not work too well with a touching stone.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[hd];B[ec]CR[ee]C[E: This creates great shape for white.]
;W[fb]C[mattos [15k\]: you];B[dd];W[cb];B[ee]C[mattos [15k\]: good night]

;W[hk];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[eq];B[dq]C[E: Good.];W[ep];B[eo]
C[E: Excellent];W[fo];B[fn]CR[en]C[E: the double hane is too agressive here, and helps create good shape for white.]
;W[en];B[do];W[gn];B[fm];W[gp]C[mattos [15k\]: how long you play go?]
;B[jp]C[E: Very good.];W[jo]C[B1ackW01f [18k\]: a few months, you?]
;B[lp]CR[ko][kp]C[E: When a stone attaches to your stone, attach or crosscut.]
;W[lo];B[np];W[no];B[ko]C[E: Very small.];W[kn];B[kp];W[mo]
;B[mp]C[E: Very small.  Do not worry too much about a small cut here.]
;W[oo];B[op]CR[qn][po]C[E: Again, do not worry about this cut so much.  The marked moves would be much bigger.]
;W[po]
(;B[qo];W[qq]C[E: An unreasonalbe invasion by white]
(;B[pq]CR[qp]SQ[op][pp]C[E: This creates an empty triangle, which is very ineficient.  Only make this shape if life or death depends upon it.  The marked space stops Black from being cut and gains a lot of corner territory.]
;W[pr];B[or]C[mattos [15k\]: one year];W[qs];B[rq];W[rr]C[B1ackW01f [18k\]: So, I think I could have killed this corner if I hadn't been greedy]

B1ackW01f [18k\]: possibly should have given up the 2 and 3 group to make a solid wall]
