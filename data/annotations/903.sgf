;B[dp]C[     The first bad play is Black 9.  My comments end with White 106. I hope these comments are helpfull.

Sincerely, uncas 5k*];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[ci];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr]
LB[cq:A][hq:B]C[    Black 9 at "a" results in White getting good positions on the lower Left and lower right, and with Black being overconcentrated on the bottom.   Either of the variations that start with "A" or "B" would be better for Black....open tree window.]

(;B[kq];W[iq];B[nq];W[oq];B[np]C[You would really like Black 9 to be 3 spaces from the "iron post" of 11 and 13.  So these stones are a bit inefficient.]
;W[pn]LB[jd:A][nc:B]C[Black 15 @ "a" is much too early. Either "A" or "B" is better.]
;B[ql]LB[qi:A]C[See the earlier remark regarding Black 9.  Here is the result.

    White 16 @ "a" is too territorial.  The sequence starting with "A" is better.

   When W plays @ "a", Black often has opportunities to ruin W's corner formation anyway.]

(;W[qm];B[qf]LB[qi:A][pl:B]C[ Black 17 is too much.  Black must stand at point "B".  If White's lower right corner is eventually sealed off, then Black has an excellent chance of attacking this corner.

White 18 @ "a" must  also be regarded as bad.  W seems focused on corner profit above all else.

   The pincer @ "A" is better.  See the variation.]
(;W[qe];B[pi]C[Of course even with Black 19, Black is still very thin on the right side.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[re]LB[jd:A]C[Black 23 @ "a" is too small: "A" is better.]
;B[rf];W[co]LB[do:A]C[W is strong at the bottom left, so the obvious connection @ "A" is much better than B's play at "a"--see variation.]

(;B[cn];W[cp]LB[do:A]C[Black's connection at "A" is more important than "a" (at this time at least).  Point "a" looks pretty good, but "play at a crucial point before a big one".]

;W[cm];B[bl];W[bm];B[bn];W[dm];B[am]LB[db:A]C[White 46 @"A", perhaps, rather than "a". Of course "A" is a probe, and Black can respond in various ways.]

(;W[hc]LB[fc:A]C[Black @ "A" is obviouly good for his upper left corner. Also, it works well because of the Black stones on the Right side... see variation.]

(;B[lc];W[he];B[jf];W[jb]LB[fc:A]C[51 @ "a", pushing against the knights move is often a bad poicy.  In doing so, White achieves a secure position at the top.

Instead of "a",  point "A" looks much better.  Black at A gives Black a very nice corner.  Also it constitutes a severe attack on the White stones.]

;B[hf]TR[do][rl][sf]C[White 62 @ "a" is much too small at this stage (since W is already alive, even without  "a")

Any of the 3 points marked by a triangle are  bigger.  (Actually, my triangle in the upper right is about the same as your "a".)]

;W[qi];B[rm];W[rn];B[sl];W[ne];B[ol];W[pm]LB[fo:A]C[Black 91 @ "A" (not "a") further limits White's territorial prospects at the bottom .  The play @ "a" is not much of a threat to the White stones on the left because they are actually pretty strong.]
