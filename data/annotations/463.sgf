Game commented by "Niall" at the
request of "amodeo", who played B.

playing for influence

me to leave some weakness at H17]WL[1172];B[cj]BL[1122];W[cn]
C[NM: Given that B has played C10 rather than C9, C6 may be reasonable.
I think I would play a larger-scale move
such as Q10, K4, or O17; but these
judgements are very hard (and I'm only
5 kyu).]WL[1159];B[pj]C[NM: Good]BL[1115];W[nc]WL[1154];B[jp]

points, with a view to exploiting the
weak point of H17 later.]BL[1083];W[qf]C[NM: A good position for the double
kakari.]WL[1147];B[nd]C[NM: The right stone to attack.]BL[1080]

;B[ge]BL[759];W[ic]WL[963];B[gd]BL[757];W[gc]WL[962];B[fe]C[NM: F15 is bad. It is gote, and the B
thickness is crying out to be turned into territory while attacking the W R side
stones.
Something like N9 is called for.]BL[755];W[lh]C[NM: Excellent, and very hard to attack
effectively.]WL[941];B[mj]C[NM: ... but that's a fair enough way to
attack, keeping an eye on the R side stones.]BL[735];W[ki]C[NM: Solid.  I think I would have played something a bit lighter, like L10.]
WL[925];B[ml]MA[qn][hj][kk][gj]C[NM: Attacking, perhaps more than
anything else after the fuseki, is a
matter of style.   My inclination would
be to go for one of the marked points,
as N8 neither really attacks the R side
stones nor puts any pressure on the
centre ones. It does however ensure the separation of the groups, and prepares
for an attack on the R, so maybe it's
good.]BL[703];W[lf]C[NM: An overplay, in my judgement.]WL[920]
;B[qn]C[NM: Excellent reply. B should certainly
not connect, since both groups are
strong.]BL[684];W[pn]WL[891];B[qo]BL[675];W[qm]WL[855];B[po]
C[NM: Q5 is bad. It just induces P6, which
improves W's eye space.
What is the right move is mooter, but
I think I would go for R9 followed by
S7 or S6.]BL[657];W[on]WL[854];B[mo]C[NM: I don't like N5; it's a move
defending territory (and not very  securely at that), putting hardly any
pressure on the W stones.
I would play J11.]BL[593];W[kk]C[NM: Good.]WL[810];B[lj]BL[576]
;W[kj]WL[808];B[gp]C[NM: G4 is certainly big, but it only
puts very indirect pressure on. I still
prefer J11 (which is about as big).]BL[488];W[nq]C[NM: Good, exploiting the great area
left under N5.]WL[757];B[no]C[NM: I think I would play M3 here,
though O5 does put some pressure on
the side group.]BL[425];W[lp]WL[725]
(;B[kn]C[NM: L6 looks attractive, but I would
defend the corner.  W can't link his two
groups easily.  See variation.]BL[386];W[pr]C[NM: W should be able to live now,
taking away a LOT of B territory.]WL[721];B[qr]BL[384];W[qq]

D3 to make trouble with in the corner,
even if G3 gets surrounded.]BL[146];W[jo]WL[597];B[jr]BL[120]

to save the K3 group (see the variation
for some possibilities), though the
result is not a total success for B.]BL[103];W[kp]WL[582]

to exploit the aji of the K3 group
