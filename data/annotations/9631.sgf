C[kamoro: Hi
Gaudeo: Hi :)

Yoaav: You were definitely having a good game until things took an unfortunate turn. There are a couple of fundamental principles that, if followed, could have made a big difference. So that means it shouldn't be too hard for you to get substantially stronger.]
;B[pp]C[Gaudeo: Hi :)];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[qj];W[cn];B[fq];W[cp]
;B[cq];W[dj];B[jc]LB[fc:1][oc:2][od:3]C[Yoaav: I like that you played tenuki here. (That is, that you played away from the bottom left corner.) Your position is better than white's, but there are bigger moves on the board than could be gotten from harassing white's position there. But the split feels just a little bit slow to me. White will be able to gain strength by pressing in against you. This is particularly powerful if white builds his left side further. For that reason, my favorite move on the boad is 1; that approach would help limit the left side. If white pincers you take the corner, and if white backs off you just build a nice group on the side. But approaching the other corner stone at 2 or 3 would also be good. They'd also make it harder for white to build his left side by pressuring you.]
;W[mc];B[gc];W[bp];B[jq]LB[jp:1]TR[qj]SQ[qq]C[Yoaav: This is a mistake (though admittedly a subtle one). If you're going to play at the bottom (which is a totally legitimate choice) the place to play is at 1. There are three different reasons why. In order of ascending importance: First, it's better shape to have a three-space extension have one stone on the third line and one stone on the fourth line than to have it have both stones on the third line. The two stones on the third line are split more easily (by a play right in the middle, in this case at H3). The conection is better with one stone on the fourth line. Then if white plays H3 you play H4 and if white plays H4 you play H3. The connection is actually easier to maintain. Second, you're strong on the bottom, so you should try to build something big. Third line moves are more for hunkering down and making sure you're strong. Your moves on the top, for example, are *perfect* on the third line. But on the bottom you shouldn't worry about being strong enough to survive. You should make him worry that you're going to make a huge territory! Third, it's bad shape to have two different low extensions from your 44 stone on Q4. (I've noted them with triangles.) If white invades at the 33 point (which, I note he does immediately) you'll pick a direction to block and get a huge wall in that direction. But if your extensions are both low, it'll be hard to get as much profit as you should out of the huge wall. White will come away from the invasion with the next move, and he can use that move to reduce. Having a fourth-line stone to build off of would be much better. In general, if an opponent of yours ever has two low 5-space extensions off of a 44 point, just invade the 33.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[Yoaav: Good direction. Even if the K3 stone is low, there's still definitely more potential along the bottom than along the side.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]C[Yoaav: This is *terrible* for white. Pushing along the second line is really painful, and there's no good reason for white to do it.]
;B[ql]C[Yoaav: Excellent! Keep him sealed in. Your R8 stone is worth *way* more than his S7 stone (which makes him, literally, a single point).]
;W[rl]C[Yoaav: Another terrible move from him!];B[qk]LB[rk:1]
C[Yoaav: I'm not convinced you need to respond here. He can't really break out even if you play elsewhere. This exchange is still *super* good for you, though. If you were going to play locally, you might have thought about playing at 1, which would have sealed in that side. But I'd have liked a move on the left side even better, something to act as an extension from your thickness.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[od]LB[io:2][jo:1]C[Yoaav: White's move is pretty small. I'd have come in at 1 or 2 to try to reduce your *huge* bottom area.]
;B[me]LB[db:4][ge:6][je:5][fj:1][ek:2][dl:3]C[Yoaav: This move is the first really big mistake I've seen from you. It doesn't really do anything. The stone is just floating by itself. It's really important to note that it's not connected with the G17 and K17 stones. White can split very easily. Three over and two up is just too far away. Right now, there are two things for you to think about: making a ton of points on the bottom and making sure that your top group is strong. And really, you don't need to worry about the top group yet---there's no one move white can play to put it into trouble. So I'd focus on the bottom. Something like 1, 2, or 3, probably. I like 2 the best. It's unusual to shoulder-hit a stone on the fourth line, but your potential is so big I think it's worth it. Anyhoo, if you were interested in making the top group strong, the moves to do that are 4, 5, and 6. Of those, 4 is definitely the best––-it pressure's white's corner, and so can make you actual points on the top. 5 and 6 are more for just making sure you have enough space to make eyes and access to the center.]
;W[cg];B[eg]LB[cb:2][db:1]C[Yoaav: After white's move, slide to 1. If he doesn't respond, the follow-up is at 2. Then the stones are conected, strong, and the corner is yours and white's left side is reduced. And if white does respond, you can settle yor top group in sente and then go down and make your million points on the bottom. E13 is another floating move. This stone isn't really doing anything.]
;W[fi]C[Yoaav: This isn't a great move from white, but note that he's able to pressure your E13 stone and reduce your potential and the middle/bottom at the same time.]
;B[fm];W[dl];B[mj]C[Yoaav: I'd have followed-up on the left side, where he's threatening to come in.]
;W[gk];B[hm]C[Yoaav: Now the area's smaller than it would have been. Still pretty darn huge, but substantially smaller.]
;W[ik];B[jm];W[kk];B[lm];W[li];B[mh];W[gf];B[jf]LB[db:2][je:1]
C[Yoaav: The two-space jump is much more easily cut than a one-space jump. If you want to jump to the center, go to 1. But the slide at 2 is *way* better.]
;W[ig];B[he];W[ge];B[gd];W[ed];B[qf];W[mi];B[ni];W[jg];B[kg]
LB[kf:1]C[Yoaav: Why here instead of at 1? Just be strong. It's really bad to leave weaknesses for no reason. This makes it much easier for white to try to split you later.]
;W[kh];B[eb];W[db];B[fc];W[ec];B[fb]LB[fa:3][fb:1][gb:2][kb:4]
C[Yoaav: This is a mistake. Right now it's more important to make sure that you have enough space to make eyes. 1 is not urgent. If white plays at 1 then you play at 2, putting that stone into atari and forcing white to take at 3. Then you get a stone at 2 in sente---it'd still be your turn. With a move at 4 instead your group would have lived easily.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[of];B[qh];W[oh];B[oi];W[nh];B[mg];W[kd];B[ld]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[lb];B[jd];W[ke];B[le];W[kf]C[Yoaav: Ouch.];B[lg]
C[Yoaav: At this point, this group is dead. It's cut off, and there's really nothing it can do to make eyes. Better to save the other group for which there is still hope.]
;W[je];B[if];W[hf]LB[hd:3][ie:1][hf:2]C[Yoaav: This is actually a mistake by white. Better to play at 1 instead. Then if you play at 2 he can play at 3 and capture the whole thing.]
;B[ie];W[jb];B[lf]C[Yoaav: Another stone spent on a dead group. When he connects at L18 he'll be stronger than he would have been otherwise.]
;W[kb];B[ib];W[id];B[ic];W[hd]C[Gaudeo: Thanks for the game
kamoro: gg

Yoaav: Let me close by strongly recommending Nick Sibicky's youtube Go videos to you. He teaches a double-digit kyu class at the Seattle Go Center, and uploads his lectures. He's a great teacher, and I found it *extremely* helpful to hear what a strong player thought about kyu players' moves. There's lots of great stuff available from him, but I think his game reviews were the most helpful in giving me a sense of what moves are good and what moves aren't. Best of luck with your Go studies! With a bit of practice you'll get tremendously stronger in short order.

Best,
Yoaav])
