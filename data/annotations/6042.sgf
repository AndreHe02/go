Masuran [14k\]: Have a good game

;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[nm]
(;B[ol]C[> Up to here a nice joseki I believe. Could I have done any better here?

vlkplk: It is a question, whether black can afford to give up lower side in exchange for right sight. I believe there still remain some possibility of white invasion there. Now, however, since white`s group has cutting points, black `territory` on right is somehow safe.]
;W[fq]
(;B[hq]C[vlkplk: As a pincer move, black`s H3 is ofcourse stronger than would be black`s J3, but considering an  extension from black`s M3, J3 would be much better, I think. After H3, white`s K3 is natural.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[dr]C[vlkplk: Now black had a chance to play K4 and safe his two stones on lower side.]

(;B[cq];W[jq]
(;B[jp]C[> This should turn out better for me, but at the moment that was the best move I could think off. As you can see from his reponse, I really lost the lower side here.

> Is the variation any better?

vlkplk: Final result in actual game was not so bad for black. Black didn`t lose whole lover side.]
;W[kp]
(;B[kq];W[ip];B[jo];W[iq];B[lo];W[io];B[jn]C[vlkplk: I think this exchange of white`s J5 and black`s K6 helped black a lot.

At the end of this fight, white and black has each one secured group, while white`s right group has still some cutting points, so as do have black stones along the right side. So I would say, this was a fair result.]
;W[jd];B[gc];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ic];B[gf];W[ne];B[ng]
C[vlkplk: Black seems to play consistently with his strategy to build large moyos along left and right sides. White has already got some smaler but safe territory, which on the other hand can still be reduced as game proceeds.]
;W[cg]
(;B[cf]C[vlkplk: Generaly speaking, contact moves like black`s C14 should be used only in situations, when one is in urgent need of defense and wants opponent to respond somehow to be able quickly make a livable shape. They SHOULDN`T BE used for the purpose of attacking opponents stone(s), since it in the contrary helps opponents in the above mentioned way. So says the book, it`s not my invention.

There are some non-contact technique of attacking to be used, like shoulder hit or boshi.]

(;B[qi]C[vlkplk: Better at S11. If white pushes in, it makes black`s moyo into a territory.]
;W[rh]
(;B[qg]C[vlkplk: Strange move. Black cannot protect both sides at the same time. I would better try playing as in variation, letting white live along the side.]
;W[ph]
(;B[oh]C[vlkplk: Same comment about contact moves as befor applies here as well. White seems almost dead and it`s better to approach him from a bit far.

By playing contact moves like P12, black allowed white to make some cutting points, which turned out to be helpful for white.]

;W[nf]C[vlkplk: This cut was very very big. Black should better connect it, even this would mean a goteh move. Now, in addition of actual gain for white, there is also possibility of black loosing his corner stones.]
;B[mg]C[vlkplk: Heavy try...];W[ki];B[kj];W[li];B[jj];W[kg]

(;B[lf]C[vlkplk: Since white is (almost) connected, black should better give up his four stones at N13 and play elsewhere.]
