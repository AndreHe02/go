C[This game was a little disappointing: I'm IGS 14k* (or at least I was :), and my opponent was IGS 17k*. I was white.

I haven't the foggiest what I did wrong.  _Please_ point out what I did wrong :) !

Sorry about the delay with the review. My problem was I didn't know how to use winmgt properly!!!
I hope these comments will help, and that some of them are actually correct!

I have to agree!!!];B[pe]C[I've asked a pro 2d and an amateur 3d about this kind of move, and they both seem to feel that it's not a good one.  But it seems to have worked really well with black's upper left corner.

Is there something I can do to keep this from turning into a huge black moyo on the top?

I am afraid I do not understand why this is not good for B - perhaps your pro 2d could tell me]
;W[pf];B[qd];W[oe];B[pd]LB[re:a][qf:b][of:c][qg:d][ne:e]C[b has accepted bad shape for a secure corner and 2 w cutting points

Normal alternatives are a, b or c
 I do not know which is best

You played d, which I think is bad shape, and suggest e, which is a bit strange because it does not protect either cut

You should play for the centre with c (Var 5)]

yes];B[ne]LB[og:a]C[maybe better at a or tenuki];W[og];B[nf]

I think this is a quite playable position, but B has good forcing moves at a and b]
;B[cg]C[This seems like a pretty small extension, a "slow move".  I know, it's pretty stupid to criticize your opponent's moves when you lose so big, but...  This makes me feel all the more like I'm missing something really important, if black can make slow moves, and still overtake me in a huge way.

it is too small an extension - overconcentrated];W[ng]LB[dj:a]
