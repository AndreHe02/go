C[Though I lost this game, I was, in many ways, happy with it. I am rated 11k* and medot is 5k*
on nngs. with a 6 stone difference, loosing by 26.5 is pretty good. Furthermore I allowed one
undo. I was grateful for an even game against a higher player, and so I didn't want him to
loose on something he considered to be a silly error. So 26.5 and 1 undo makes it quite an
accomplishment from my perspective.  Two things that bug me however. The first is I don't see
any clear way I could have won the game, and second I am given to wonder if the 'better than
would be expected" result is good play on my part or did white make a serious error I do not
appriciate.]PL[B];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[ip];W[qn]LB[on:a]
[ql:b][qk:c][pj:d][qq:e]C[Black usually pincers next. Black isn't really thick enough to play
the knight's move at (a). Instead black more usually plays at (b), (c)
or (d). After those pincers white will usually dive into the corner (e),
and black develops thickness along line Q];B[on];W[pl];B[dj]
;W[mq]LB[lp:a]C[Black is playing for thickness, therefore the following move would be
better at (a)];B[nq];W[np];B[oq];W[mn];B[qo];W[pn];B[oo];W[om]
;B[no]C[I was quite pleased with this move I gained sente and protected against w q5.]
;W[mo];B[fc]LB[nm:a]C[I think the focus of the game is still on the bottom right. White isn't
settled, but can be if they play (a). I think this move should be at (a),
splitting white in two - and making use of your bottom left thickness.]

;W[kb];B[ma];W[ke];B[if];W[lf];B[ng];W[kh];B[jg]LB[ph:a][nm:b]
C[I suspect this move may have been slow, I considered something along the lines of a stone
around q11,q12, or any of the surrounding spaces, but I felt I would probably be stretching too
far too thin, and wind up loosing it. smaller extensions didn't seem to be worth enough to play
them. This move is one of my prim suspects for where I might have done better.

I agree - there seem to be two better moves (a) and (b). (a) only really
reduces territory. (b) puts pressure on white. Even more pressure on
white because white will then have two weak groups on the board at the
same time. At the moment all of black's groups are largely secure. Black
should go on the offensive];W[ph];B[oh]C[now I play in that direction because I wanted to make sure the upper right group prevented a
moyo around the n9 area];W[pi];B[qb]C[and I also recognize that escaping to connect is unlikely, so safety first....]
;W[cl]LB[cj:a][el:b][fj:c][gl:d][il:e]C[I was impressed by white's move here. very nice tenuki I though. I definately didn't feel I
could tenuki back and play s17.

It seems like white is overextended. I'd respond to this move with black
(a) - then white (b) - black (c) - white (d) - probably then black (e).
White now has THREE unsettled groups on the board (if black gets to cut  at O7). If that happened: white could expect to either lose one of the
groups and/or give black massive thickness. With that thickness black
could then easily reduce/invade or make territory.];B[dm];W[cm]

C[Again, I think (a) is better. It stops (d) being sente and later black
can play (e) in sente. If later white plays (b) - black (c) is almost  identical to what happened later in this game]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg];B[eh];W[ef];B[ei]C[Since my main goal had been to keep white separate, and press on white's side group, but I

;B[cn];W[ai];B[bm];W[bl];B[jm];W[gp]LB[fq:a][ep:b]C[I haved a feeling I should have handled this invasion by white differently... but how. Also a
prime supsect in the hunt for where I lost the game.

Playing (a) is too close to white. white can lean on it to help make
shape. I would have played (b).. It still squeeses white - but doesnt
give white so much aji];B[fq];W[gq];B[iq]LB[eq:a]C[I didn't want white to slide to j2, but now f3 is in trouble. would e3 have been better?

I think you had to play J3 now - but I would change how you  later responded to (a)]
;W[eq];B[fp]LB[cq:a]C[Rather then this move, I think Black should play (a) and keep
white out of the corner.];W[fr];B[ep];W[dq];B[dp];W[hr];B[ir]
;W[br];B[cq];W[cr];B[go]LB[hm:a][nm:b]C[Its starting to look ugly for black now, this move should probably have been played at (a). If black can secure the stones at J2, J3 and J4 - the
cut at (b) is on again];W[ho];B[hp]LB[io:a]C[Probably needs to be at (a)]
;W[hn];B[ji]C[I knew this would be risky, but I figured I would probably be able to connect j2 if i played
n2 first, or connect j2 up through k7 to k11.];W[gn];B[fo];W[jn]
;B[im];W[jo];B[gl]C[I felt it would be too inconsistant to give white the chance to play g8. At this point I
hoped that white would want to take care of business around s18 or secure the l18 group giving
me the chance to rescue j2.

s18 is worth a few points, but its definitly an endgame move (its probably
around 8-10 points. The stones around J2 are definitely a bigger
concern then S18. However,  White will want to secure the stones around
L18 and there is lots of bad aji for black around the e10 area, so playing
this move (g8) is probably reasonable.];W[ki];B[jj];W[ek];B[ej]

(;W[gr]C[Medot originally played this stone at g1 to which I responded h3. I gave it back because he
did move quickly, and I didn't want to throw my rating into the stratosphere unless I really
could earn it. Besides, I can also view an undo as a simultaneous resignation and offer to
examine the position in light of a better move.

remember that b15 would be sente for white, but I couldn't read all the ways attacks on f8 and
pusing at f11 by white could combine. I probably should have waited, but I couldn't stand the
look of that area and felt like I was sure to miss something. Though at this point I don't
think it is a game decider.

I agree it wasn't a game decider, but I think you could have waited. B18 is bigger]

   White = 62 territory + 26 captures + 0.5 komi = 88.5
   Black = 45 territory + 17 captures = 62
White wins by 26.5.

When black plays the chinese opening - black has created a formation  that radiates power. White will be forced to invade the formation and
black must then decide how to deal with those invasions. Invasions
are hard to kill - therefore white's goal is usually to attack white -
restricting white's eyespace and in the process developing thickness
and hence territory in other areas. In this game, white's invasions
seemed to settle themselves easily - or when they were not settled -
black did not take advantage of their weakness.]PL[B])
