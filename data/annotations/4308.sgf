C[xinwen [15k\]: eat eat

Hi reviewer, i'm xinwen, Hope you can review it your own way if you don't mind..

>>> Hello my name is Tom. I hope you find the review helpful.]

;B[nd];W[cf]
(;B[ch]LB[pi:A]C[was my pincer correct? i realised that the result is not too good.. maybe i should just F16?

>>> I think the pincer was played to early. White has over extended by approaching twice. Typically, after O16, White would play somewhere near Q11(A). So, after a double approach, black can enclose both corners and then pincer which ever white stone is left undefended. (See Variation)]
;W[fc]C[>>> Now white complicates things with a double approach and a fight that aims to not only take some of the corner but to establisha position at the top. This will cancel the positive effect of the sanrensai opening for black if white succeeds.]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ce]C[I feel like that C15 is wrong.. is it the best move?

>>> I think C15 is fine. It keeps pressure on white and begins to secure the corner.]
;W[cg];B[ef];W[dc];B[cc];W[db];B[cb];W[gd];B[eg]LB[kq:C][pi:B]
[dn:A]C[>>> I don't like this move. It forces a response from white that onlyt weakens blacks 12 stone. I would prefer a bigger move elsewhere, such as some of the moves marked. Each of these has a much bigger impact on the game.]
;W[dh];B[cn]C[>>> Now you get to this move, but c12 is now weaker and less able to support this approach.]
;W[ci]C[why C11? is it urgent? or because my C6 can rescue it?

>>> Urgent because of C6 yes, White must gain stability on the left.  If the left whtie group dies or is even severely threatened it will be a big gain for black.]
;B[eh]C[>>> Agian what is gained here?];W[ic]C[>>> blacck would have been better off playing this or H17 rather than E12.]
;B[jc]C[>>> Now white has room to make easy life.];W[fp];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[ck];W[ei];B[ek];W[bj];B[bk];W[fi];B[gg];W[fk];B[fl]
C[>>> Try to look for ways to show white you are not afraid of him. Do not follow him around the board. A play on the right using your upperr right stones is better than answering this move, I think.]
;W[gk];B[fn];W[gl];B[el];W[iq]C[>>> Again, very passive play has given white easy gains while delivering only lilmite success for black.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[pp]C[i choose Avalanche as my joseki here.. the result seem to be not too good.. but i considered the corner of Bottom Left... Which joseki should i choose here..?

>>> This worked out okay, by keeping white relatively low at the bottom and it built thickness. So, okay, I think,]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[nq];B[qq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[np];W[mp];B[mq]
;W[qr];B[mo];W[lp];B[pk]LB[qh:D][ph:C][qi:B][pi:A]C[I feel like i made mistakes here, Q9 too far? and i'm helping White to secure his bottom?

>>> the marked spots are better as they use the thickness built at the bottom better.]
;W[rd]C[should i let the White to have the corner and i R12 here?]
;B[qc]C[>>> No, this iscorrect. Giving white the corner would have been worse for black. Now you can see the effect of lplaying too slack with your extension. Had you moved  further from your wall, white would not have the option of an easy extension at R11.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[mk]TR[jd][jc]C[Is my N9 wrong?

>>> I like  something like P13 better. It has the effect of threatening white while bulding territory at the top by working with the marked stones. N9 is not as effective overall,]

C[i realised L3 was not so good.. becuz.. White has more chance]
;W[lr];B[ll];W[mm];B[lk];W[ko]C[>>> The mistake was not L3 but leaving this cut.]

I realised my end game kinda.. weak, didnt manage to reduce opponent points.. only get reduced by oppnent.. ^^||

>>> The end game if played well by both players sould be even. It is only when one player doesn't understand the end game as well or has not properrly prepared for it that that player falls behind. That is the case here. :)]

>>> I think overall, the difference was judgement in the opening and early middle game. White, being considerably stronger prerpare for the middle game fights better and also understands sente better. THis was the difference in the game.  Overrall I would say be very careful with your opening moves. Always try to thrink through the consequences of these foundational plays. extra consideration early pays of very big indeed in the middle game. 

Also, another suggestion is that when you play someone who is 4k like this, ask them to reveiw the game with you if you play on KGS. I'm not sure if any of the IGS clients have this cap[ability. Many players are glad to do this and you will find it very helpful.
