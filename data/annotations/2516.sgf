C[pajaro: Hi. This is a game I played as white. After going over it, I think that I lost because I didn't manage to play in the right direction at the right time. Also, my yose is awful. I must work on it. I have made some commentaries, which will begin with pajaro:

Thanks.

TA: OK, let's start];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc]C[pajaro: I san-san good here? Black seems to want to play chinese fuseki. I don't want to do the same.  I have problems dealing with it, so I thought that I would have a secure corner, to not having to worry about it.

TA: I don't know if you already can say which joseki is best here. I think you can do everything here, including playing chinese, too.]
;B[pk]C[pajaro: As expected.];W[nc]LB[po:B][jp:A]C[pajaro: Right approach?

TA: In this corner this is OK. but you could also play around A, which I prefer. Makes an invasion at B much easier.]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[pajaro: I think my upper side is now nicely balanced.

TA: It's OK.];B[jp];W[dj];B[fq];W[po]TR[jp]C[pajaro: I know it is hard to let black play a double-kakari. But if I just play C6 and let black make a shimari with Q5, his position will seem to good.

TA: I agree. Here you see, how anoying the marked stone is when you still want to invade the right border. But the position is still balanced.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql]C[pajaro: After the game, I saw in a book that this might be bad. Better one line shorter (R7) in order to not help black. Right?

TA: I wouldn't dare to criticise the books ;-))
Well, the meaning what they say is, when you play R7 it is much more difficult for black to invade into your position and then he would not play R9, which helps his right side enourmously.]
;B[qk];W[ol]C[TA: Quite interesting. But I think, it is OK, as long as you consider your stones lightly (this means you don't fight for each single stone). To be continued...]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[qn];B[rl];W[on]LB[nm:B][om:A]TR[fd]C[pajaro: Black is stronger in the side, and I am alive. Good exchange?

TA: Before this last move, may be. But you have already perfect eye shape and can easily walk to the center. So this last move is definitely to scared.
A move like marked (F16) is much bigger. Black cannot kill you so easily.
If you feel you have to do something for this group, you should play A, since black B can force A anyway, and now this would make your last move irrelevant.]
;B[lp]LB[dd:B][ed:C][de:A]C[TA: This is definitely too close. Since Black is strong in the lower area, white would not invade here. One of A to C is much stronger. I think, I'd prefer B in order to make the white framework much smaller.]
;W[ph]LB[fd:A][de:B][dn:C]C[TA: No. Below, black has a ponnuki, so he is strong there. And further down there is still this group you are not so sure about so better don't start a fight here. You might suffer a lot when black keeps this stone seperated from your other weak group.
It is still the time where extending your own framework is most urgent! But I know how difficult it is to see your opponents framework getting bigger and safer. But be aware how black must feel after a move like A, B or C. Since the upper right corner is still open (3-3), you can get a bit of this cake, too.]
;B[ne];W[ld];B[ok]C[TA: This is what I mean: By playing between your weak groups, one of them will suffer. Quite easy, isn't it? ;-)]
;W[nh];B[oi]LB[og:C][nl:A][om:B][on:D]C[TA: Wrong direction. First, black should exchange A for B. white cannot afford to let black make another ponnuki and lose all his eye potential. By the way, here you see again, why B was better than the lose connection of D.
After the A-B exchange, black should play from his weak side (corner group) and press against his strong group in the middle. So C is better then. The simple rule is that you play with your weak group and press against the strong one. The difficult thing now only is (I know!): which of the groups is weak? A group with a ponnuki is nearly always strong!]
;W[of]C[pajaro: I tried to play lightly here. Connecting would be heavy.

TA: I think, connecting is better. Since your group can still run into the center (where no black stone is annoying you yet), this increases the pressure on the black corner. Don't forget that the 3-3 invasion is still possible and black will have no eye space for the corner group then! So his last move only helps you to inrease the pressure on the corner group by connecting!]
;B[oh];W[pg];B[og];W[qf];B[pe];W[qc]TR[of][qf][pg][ph]C[pajaro: As the invasion hasn't gone well, I invade. Black will have to give me the side I want. I'm happy with this.

TA: Sorry, no, not at all! Black has gained a big edge and the only thing you got was something  you could get anytime. The 3-3 invasion was  your right anyway without giving the big boarder and center influence away. This exchange was extremely bad for white. The marked stones only helped black to strenghten his wall and territory and then died.]
;B[qe];W[pc];B[nf]TR[qf][pg][ph]C[pajaro: After the invasion, black plays this to remove aji. Since it's gote, the P14 stone now seems to have been a better play, though I don't think that black should have played O14 now.

TA: Yes, you are right. Since the white marked group is dead, there is nearly no aji. 

I wonder why nobody likes the upper left corner? There are so many points lying around there. A huge framework is asking to be realized, but nobody cares. It is a pity.]
;W[cf]TR[ed][fd][de][df]C[pajaro: Nothing to attack, nothing to invade... Let's take profit. Is this the biggest area?

TA: Aha! Yeah, except that you can play more courageously here as stated several times: Build up influence on a big scale. 
The meaning of a huge framework is not to make profit on the third line but to threaten to make a huge territory and ask the opponent to risk an invasion or reduce so slightly that you profit much more. Here one of the marked positions is appropriate, I think.]
;B[cn];W[co]LB[eo:A]C[TA: Maybe it is a question of taste, but I prefer just A which does not reinforce the black stone.]
;B[dn];W[fp]C[pajaro: I'll try to lean on these stones, go into the center, and attack the D6 group.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp]LB[fn:A]C[TA: This exchange only helps black to turn his influence into territory. Black anyway still has the option to enter at 3-3 or to walk into the center with A. This leaves white with neither territory nor influence.]
;W[hq];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[ho];B[ip];W[fn]LB[dq:A][gr:B]TR[hq]
[hr]C[TA: I think the best way to give the marked sacrificed stone a sense is to play A in sente. black must answer at B and kill already dead stones.]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[fm];W[gm]LB[fd:E][fj:C][em:B][gm:D][en:A]C[TA: I get the feeling white wants to kill immediately. This is no good idea. The general approach should be: Keep the pressure and take profit while black still has to care about his weak group. Beating so long the weak group until it is alive only loses the attacking potential. This is only a good idea when you are really sure you can kill. But this cannot be in this situation.

Suggestion: White A, Black B, White C, Black D, White E. Compare this. White is much ahead then. Black will most probably run away with his weak group but how about the huge white framework in the top then? 
Even better: After this, whenever black tries to invade the top area, white playing aroud C will get him into trouble again with his lower running group. Is this convincing?]
;B[fl];W[en];B[em];W[cl]C[TA: No. Let him make his eyes, if he likes. You can still use this move for much better profit. I guess, by now you know where...]
;B[bn];W[bo]C[TA: This doesn't give profit since the corner is open anyway. 
But I know, it is difficult to not try to kill. Killing is simply more fun ;-) But when you want to make progress, please concentrate on the biggest profit, not on killing.]
;B[cr];W[dr]C[TA: Better 3-3];B[dq];W[cq];B[bq];W[cp];B[er]
;W[br];B[ds];W[aq]LB[il:A]C[TA: Making one gote eye is less then just running into the center with e.g. A, which also will keep a bit pressure on the left group and help the center/upper framework]
;B[bs];W[ar];B[gl]C[TA: Biiiiiiiig move.];W[hm];B[ch]C[TA: this looks very courageous, if not mad...]
;W[dh];B[dg];W[cg];B[di];W[eh];B[cj];W[ei];B[ci];W[dk]C[TA: black is already dead.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[bk];W[bl];B[fj];W[ej]LB[bj:A]C[pajaro: This is a mistake. I didn't want black to but me, but I think that I can capture C11 easily, so I'm strong. Thanks to this, black will make shape.

TA: You are right. A makes easily an eye yo youdon't have to care about shortage of liberties.]
;B[ek]C[pajaro: Now black is very strong];W[gh];B[gc]C[TA: Finaly, he found it. Still your last move aroud here would have been a difference of about 30 points. Now it is really difficult to kill him of at least to attack him so that you profit enough.]
;W[gj]LB[hk:B][hl:A]C[TA: If you still want to kill, A or B might be better. But I don't think this will really kill.]
;B[hl];W[im];B[il];W[ec]C[TA: Quite modest now, but maybe still the best now.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[jc];W[kc];B[hc];W[id];B[ge];W[ef]LB[fb:B][dg:A]
C[TA: In order to win, white already has to kill the upper group, so why not let him connect with A and play B instead? In order to kill this is the strongest.]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[ee];W[de];B[fc];W[eb];B[ff]LB[ha:C][eg:A][fg:B]
C[TA: Balck A is no threat, since white B still captures, so better use this move for C which kills the eyes at the upper edge. Black will have a harder time then.]
;W[fg];B[fb];W[gf]LB[fd:B][hd:C][fe:A]C[TA: Better throw in at A, black B, white C, and again the eyes are gone.]
;B[fe];W[ib];B[ic];W[ja];B[hb];W[ia];B[ha];W[ka]C[pajaro: He's alive, but I feel that white might have done better.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[nl]C[TA: Good move, which shoud have come much earlier. Now that the potential to flee into the center is very limited, this is severe.]
;W[nm]LB[om:A]C[TA: I think the connection at A is the only move.]
;B[ml]LB[om:A]C[TA: no! Of course black must play A. this will be a hard fight for white to survive!]
;W[mm];B[ll];W[jl]C[pajaro: This is the las attempt agains the black G8 group, as he has only one eye.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[hj];W[gk];B[fk];W[gi];B[ih];W[he];B[hd];W[if]
;B[jm];W[kg]LB[ki:A]C[pajaro: After the cut, my only chance is to connect.

TA: OK, but then A is better. Maybe you can keep some pressure on the left lack group which still only has one eye. Sorry, I cannot calculate to the end...]
;B[ki]C[TA: OK, now the white center stones are dead and the game is over.]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[pajaro: And that's the game. What do you think?

TA: I think both of you could have gained a lot in the beginning by playing in the top left area. the 3-3 joseki not only gives you a small corner but gives you good potential when you have already extended to both sides. You just have to make another move.

Maybe you try just one thing in your next games: Have a close look which groups are weak and play with your weak groups and push the opponent towards your strong ones. This is most effective, when two weak groups fight each other. You will see how easily you profit by following this strategy. Although you may have heard it several times, playing according to it will make you advance at least two stones. What about having a second look at the game and concentrate only on this aspect?

Good luck! Torsten Arnold])
