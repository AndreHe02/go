Review for black [tengensan\] by sestir, <s> Basti Weidemyr.

<s> A tournament game from IGS. Black's strength is higher than his rating.]
;B[jj]C[[tengensan\]: I didn't find any "Tengen Fuseki" yet, so I am trying to create it because I love Tengen. Do you have some advice that it could help me to use the Tengen better?

<s> Tengen does not take any territory and its influence affects the least interesting part of the board. On the positive side, it blocks/breaks many ladders and can be used as a basis for fighting.

<s> Once you have tengen, you should try to provoke fights and running battles. Instead of making a base for your stones along the edge, you will have the option to connect your groups in the centre.

<s> Making life by making two eyes, is not usually desirable, because you need moves to make the eyes that could be better spent making territory. Connecting groups together requires usually fewer moves.

<s> If you preferr territory over influence, tengen is for you, not because it will help you make territory but due to the fact that it will force you to appreciate influence, so that your games become more balanced. :)

<s> For deeper studies, you could try these references:
http://gtl.xmp.net/reviews/by_fuseki/search
http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall];W[dp];B[pd]C[[tengensan\]: I don't know why, but 4-4 and Tengen seem to work well together...]
;W[dd];B[pq]C[[tengensan\]: But I don't know how to use influence very well, I prefer to have territory, so I play 3-4.
I don't know the diference between Q3 and R4, they make some diference in the fuseki?

<s> Both players want to play most of their moves on the 4th line. This because the 4th line is very effective with regard to taking territory. Both players also want to prevent their opponent from playing on the 4th line.

<s> By positioning your komoku this way, you make the right side interesting. For if you make an extension along the bottom, Q3 would be too low and take fewer points than if it was on the starpoint, but if you extend along the right side, it would be efficient. We say that its direction is towards the right side.

<s> Since the right side is interesting, white will be pressed to play there. However since Q16 is a black stone, white would come under attack. K16 or K17 is another option for white.]
;W[pn]LB[ql:A]C[[tengensan\]: I was happy with this move because it don't  put much pressure in Q3... Maybe he was afraid that I would make a big moyo with Tengen (but it is hard to do...).

<s> In a case like this, since you have the upper right corner, you can consider a pincer (A). Tengen also supports this option.  Another alternative is an extension along the lower side.]
;B[qo]C[<s> This touches the white stone. Both black and white will have strong positions after this and black will have missed an opportunity to use tengen for a fight.]
;W[po];B[qn]C[[tengensan\]: Q4 would be better instead of R6?

<s> Maybe a little bit. I am too weak to tell. :)];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[pm]
(;B[or]C[[tengensan\]: I thought that if he played P2, it would be beautiful because of D4, so tryed to reduce it a little...]
;W[nq]
(;B[qm]C[<s> This is too slow. P2 gave you a strong position in the corner, so you can jump.

See variation on move 14.];W[pl];B[cj]C[[tengensan\]: I heard that "the fourth line is the line of victory" and "crawling in the second line is a shame".
So I played this move, trying to cancel the "Ni-Ren-Sei", is it right?

<s> Crawling along the third line is better than crawling on the second line but it is still not good. White's wall is too strong and Q8 is ahead of R7.

<s> C10 looks ok.];W[ej]C[[tengensan\]: What?!? O_o Is this "Boshi"? But what does he want with it?

<s> He wants to split your stones apart. If you can not connect C10 to K10, it means you will need to make life for each group individually.

<s> In agreement with this strategy, white managed to kill your tengen stone later in the game. What makes this possible is the thickness exerted by the white wall in the lower right.

<s> So you need to be careful now.];B[cm]C[[tengensan\]: I choose this side to reduce his influence there... Is it right? D7 instead of C7 would be better?

<s> C7 is also my choice. Since you can not connect C10 and tengen, you should try to develop them away from each other, so that your opponent cannot make a splitting attack.

<s> C13 is also possible, if you expect the white moyo to grow so large that you will have to invade anyway.]
;W[em];B[fq]C[[tengensan\]: Since C7 and C10 is alive (for now), I tried to reduce his influence (I was really afraid with it). Now it seems that J3 would be better than F3, do you agree?

<s> Yes, I agree.];W[hq]C[[tengensan\]: In the end, he was sucessfull... =(]

<s> Not drastically.];W[bo];B[bg];W[cf];B[jc]C[[tengensan\]: I thought that my left side group was alive, so I played there to avoid him to make another big moyo...

<variation>]
(;W[je]C[[tengensan\]: He loves this kind of move... =P];B[mc]
C[[tengensan\]: N16 instead of N17?

<s> I believe it is a matter of taste.];W[me];B[pj]C[[tengensan\]: I played this trying to help my center stones, thinking in pursuing (chasing) K15 and N15, and finally do I moyo in the right side....]
;W[ql];B[qg]C[[tengensan\]: I thought: "Mwhahaha! All the right upper side is mine!" =D
    But dans turn the impossible to possible... T_T


<s> If this was in the early part of the fuseki, invading this position would not be good because black would get a lot of influence, and white's territory would be too small. So in the fuseki, you may count it as territory and be happy if white invades.

<s> This is middle game. It is no longer the time to make influence and thickness, but to turn that influence into territory. Suddenly, invading an overstretched position like this one is good.]
;W[nc]C[[tengensan\]: Is this an overplay? Should this work? I wanted to play in O16, but I guessed that he was dan, so  I didn't want to fight even with him... =(
  If you were me, how did you answered this move?

<s> I would play either O16 or P17. The fight is not even, as black has one more stone in the area.]
;B[oc];W[nb]C[<variation>]
(;B[md]C[<s> This is your worst move in this game. :)

<s> Do you know the game 'rock, paper, scissors'? 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%2CPaper%2CScissors

- The rock can make the scissors dull.
- The scissors can cut the paper.
- The paper can catch the stone.

<s> Running into a rock is a very effective way of getting stopped. Here, the black stone at N17 is running right into wN15. It is sometimes appropriate but usually not good shape.

<s> White's next move is obviously O16. It puts white ahead of black in both directions. N15 is a hane - very good shape. O18 is ahead of N17. Black will have just three liberties, compared to white's 5. It is like white wraps his groups like a paper-bag around black's group.

<s> And what about the scissors? There are two possible cuts. If black had cut at O16, white would have had to cut back. In this case, however, white O16 cuts black first, and it is black who has to cut back. Cutting first is usually advantagous.

<s> Rock, paper, scissors appear often in go strategy, allthough under different names. Rock sometimes can be likened to thickness, paper to squeezes and scissors to splitting attacks. They are all fundamental strategical concepts and it is only on rare occassions that we are able to violate them all with one move.

<s> So this is actually a good move, not because it does not lose the game for you, but because it provides a very good example of principles that we all (even 9-dans) struggle to teach ourselves to apply. :)]

;B[gc]C[[tengensan\]: I think that this is bigger and more urgent than defending at S17, am I right?

<s> I think so.

<s> Asuming black's left-side group is alive...
b: 40 points
w: 25 points
white is thick

--> Black should secure his groups and reduce any area. That is easy to say afterwards, but since a fight just finished (upper right) it is a good idea to count points.]

<s> Undo is not common in tournaments. It is a bit hard to concentrate after having killed a group. On the other hand, that is part of the game. In football, it is the same way. 1-0 often turns into 1-1 within two minutes because of lost concentration.]
