 Hi.  I am David. I played as "Macaw" in this match.  Thanks for reviewing this game for me.  I have added some of my own comments and questions along the way.  I really appreciate any suggestions and answers to my questions.

This game involved a running fight from the top early in the game.  At the end I blundered and missed a 15 point endgame tesuji, but even if I had seen it earlier, W would have won by about 2.5 points.  Please let me know where I could have played better.


Tim: Mistakes at the end can happen to anyone, I wouldn't worry too much. I think that your problem in this game is during the running fight, when you play moves that help you opponent, or you play moves on one side, that cause damage to your group on the other side.

Of course running fights are hard, but there are some fundamentals that you seem to be missing, or at least you are not applying them in this game. I really recommend the book "Opening Theory Made Easy" by Otake Hideo, that is, if you can get hold of a copy. Unfortunately it is more-or-less out of print. It is quite a basic book, but it is really clear. It covers 20 strategic principles with examples of how they apply in real situations. I like to re-read it every so often to remind myself of these basics, they are all really excellent principles. The principles that you needed to take note of in this game were number 8: "Family feuds waste resources" - in other words don't play moves on one side that do damage on the other; and "don't push from behind". Actually that second one is covered very well in "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama - another excellent book. I'm afraid I can't explain these ideas as well as either of these two books, but hopefully some of the comments I have put in the game record will give you an idea of what they mean.]

(;W[ec]C[Tim: This is not the joseki move, I have given the joseki in a variation.]
;B[qo]C[David:  I considered playing at N17 instead.  But I thought perhaps making a shimari was bigger at this point.

Tim: N17 looks a bit small, the move I would like to play is the high Chinese at Q10. Then all your stones are working together. However making a shimari can't be a mistake.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Tim: This pincer is the right move.];W[ib]C[David: Seemed odd to me to play on the 2nd line so early.

Tim: yes, if your opponent wants to play on the second line then normally you don't have to worry. In this case white's move is not so odd: white can either connect underneath at G18, or jump out at J16.]

(;B[od]LB[pe:B][lg:A]C[Tim: I do not understand why you are pushing through here. Well, if you can read out for certain that you will capture the three white stones at the top then it is OK, but if not, it serves little purpose. A better move would be to jump to A to threaten on both sides, or to crawn to be which takes 4th line territory whilst keeping up the attack.]
;W[md];B[nd]LB[ke:A]C[Tim: again, I do not see the purpose of this move. A better move is A, which defends your stones whilst threatening things on both sides.]
;W[mc]
(;B[ld]LB[ke:A][me:B]C[Tim: A is still better, but to follow up on your previous moves you should think about cutting at B.]
;W[me]C[David: now we had a running battle.  I didn't feel too bad about it as we both had 2 weak groups at the top.

Tim: Yes, but already, your two moves at O and P 16 have strengthened the white stones next to it , which has made the black stones in the middle of the side weaker. In a running fight, it is very important to avoid moves that help the opponent.]
;B[kf];W[jf]
(;B[ne]LB[kh:A]C[Tim: again, you are pushing from the wrong direction. Your corner is quite strong, it is your stones in the middle of the side that are weak so you want to add a stone to them. You should jump to A, which threatens both sides.]
;W[mf];B[kg];W[jg]
(;B[nf]C[Tim: Oh no, not again!];W[mg];B[jd]C[Tim: This is another dangerous move. Again it forces white to strengthen himself, which makes the black group to the left weaker.]
;W[ie];B[lh];W[ng];B[og]LB[pg:A]C[Tim: This is not as bad as some of your other moves, because at least this starts to surround territory. Locally, A is slightly better shape to achieve this. ("Don't play in contact with stones you want to attack.")]
;W[mi];B[jh];W[ih];B[hg]LB[ii:B][ji:A]C[Tim: Again, it seems like you are not playing on the important point, and are helping white strengthen himself. You should probably play A. The hane at B would be better if it worked, but seems to be too dangerous here.]
;W[ig]LB[ji:A]C[Tim: White should atari at A before connecting.]
;B[ji];W[hh];B[gg]LB[fh:A]C[Tim: Why are you connecting this single stone? Jumping to A seems better.]
;W[gi];B[oh];W[ni]C[David: I felt I was making more territory on the right than W was getting on the left.  My groups weren't settled yet, but neither were W's.

Tim: My feeling is that progressively the white groups are getting stronger and the black groups are getting weaker, relatively.]
;B[fi];W[gj];B[eh];W[ch];B[fj];W[lj];B[kj]LB[jk:A]C[Tim: Why are you playing in contact? An important proverb for running fights is "The one-point jump is never wrong." A slight exaggeration, but here I would jump to A, it gets you one line further out.]
;W[gk];B[jl];W[fk];B[ek];W[pj];B[qi]LB[el:A]C[David: I didn't like this move.  Perhaps K4 would have been better.

Tim: Your move looks purely territorial, and since this is right in the middle of the middle game with lots of weak groups about, this is not the time to play a territorial move. K4 would be better, it expands your area, *while strengthening your black group in the centre*.   However, I think that the vital point for both players is E8. If black plays here, then it makes black a lot stronger, whilst attacking white. If white plays here it makes the white group a lot stronger while attacking black.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[Tim: why not S11?];W[qm];B[el]C[Tim: Good.];W[gm]
;B[cj]LB[eo:A]TR[ch]C[David: I needed to secure the left group.

Tim: Yes, and this is a reasonable move. You can aim at capturing the white stone at C12 later. I was also thinking about trying a leaning move at A to try saving your group by continuing to pressure the white group in the centre. However that probably lets white take a lot of corner territory so I am not sure about this.]
;W[cm]LB[en:A]C[Tim: now I think that you should definitely jump to A. That exposes white's thinness all round, and means that you are still connected out to the middle, so you don't have to worry about eyes just yet.]
;B[gh];W[ik]C[Tim: Once again, your move on one side had forced white to play a move that makes you weaker on the other side.]

;B[jp];W[ip];B[hk]C[David: Hasty move.  I think i could have just connected at L4 first.

Tim: Yes, definitely.];W[kp];B[jq];W[iq];B[hl];W[fm];B[cq]C[Tom: Good.]

(;W[cp]C[Tim: weird. The proverb says "Block on the wider side." I am sure white should have played D3 instead.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[br]C[Tim: This is a very strange move]
;B[fq]C[Tim: Good.];W[ep];B[bq]LB[fr:A]C[Tim: This is a mistake. How do you answer a white move at F2?]

;W[bg];B[bj];W[ah];B[bi];W[nq]C[David:  This move prevented B from playing N3, but B then could play C13.

Tim: White is also starting to pressurise your corner. C13 is good, but not so big.]
;B[cg];W[cf];B[dg]
(;W[pp]C[Tim: White can do much more damage by playing in the corner. See the variations.]

;B[ll];W[ml];B[ri];W[lp];B[oo];W[no];B[ms]C[David: at this point I felt the game was still very close.

Tim: Lets count

Black:
Top right: 25

Middle: 5
Bottom left: 5
left: 10

Total: 60

White:  Bottom: 40
right: 15
Top left: 10

Total: 70

Probably not close enough.];W[mr]
