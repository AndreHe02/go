RE[W+3.50]
TM[300]

C[hoang>first off you must know that 9x9 is just _different_ this is my opinion.  i hope my review helps.  a few comments, it seems you are not 29k, but maybe its due to the 9x9 board?  a good idea for beginners is to get about 100 games out of the way asap.  remember to play solid (connecting rather than using a hanging connection when nessary) and to read(dont leave everything up to chance!).  sorry for finishing so late!

pn> review for black (pneuhaus) please.
pn> I marked my comments/questions as 'pn>'
pn> there's no need to go through all my variations, I just tried out a few things...
pn> where I felt the variations were important, I marked them A, B...
pn> although I didn't play all that bad, there must have been a few things that I
pn> could have done better, or I wouldn't have lost...
pn> any criticism and propositions welcome];B[gc]C[pn> what could I have done better in the opening?]
;W[gg]LB[cc:B][cd:A]C[hoang> c6(A) is OK!  personally in 9x9 i like to start further from the corners.  because the game is different, the methods employed should be changed.  in 19x19 the 3, 3 point is so and so but in 9x9 the center is very important so maybe a little faster.  i recommend 3, 4 but its all a matter of taste!  nothing wrong with your choices.

pn> was A too greedy? or should I've better played B?]
(;B[cd]C[hoang>not greedy at all, i like it.];W[cg]C[hoang>white is more experienced, he knows your a 29k, so he is playing safe, what he is trying is thinking is "ill win by his mistakes."]
;B[ed]C[hoang> nice!];W[fe]SQ[cd][df][ed]LB[cf:A]C[hoang> your right A is not the right move, A translate to, "i want to fight"  and you must know that a contact play makes your opponent stronger!  i recommend D4, a shoulder hit is goes along with what you were thinking and creates a 'efficient shape.'  (c6 + e6 + d4).  

pn> I'm not shure whether A was the right move...

pn> are there (better) alternatives? why? I don't see them.]

(;B[cf];W[df]C[hoang> see how he was forced to respond to your contact play?  he doesnt mind this move!]

(;B[de];W[bf]
(;B[be];W[ce]LB[ee:A][ef:B]C[hoang>yeah i dont see anypoint in B, try to keep your stones working together dont let them get separated, but of your there are times when you must jump into your enemy's territory and throw some fists!
pn> I think B wouldn't have been better, but maybe I oversee something...]

(;B[ee];W[cf];B[fd];W[ge];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[gf]LB[fg:B][hd:A]
C[hoang> see the variation.  playing B first wouldnt give you any more points but maybe... even loss points.
pn> if I play B, A can wait... would have gained me one point, eh?]

(;B[hd];W[fg];B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[gd]TR[hd][ie][if]LB[ad:B]
[ic:A]C[hoang> see variation.
pn> If I had played B here, White would have captured the marked black stones, or do I miss something?]

(;B[hg]C[hoang> instead of h3, j2 looks good!];W[hh]LB[ig:B]
[ih:A]C[pn> sometimes I see so much potential territory that I don't see when I'm in atari... ;-)
pn> B of course!!

pn> how many points did it cost me? 3, 4? I'm not sure how to count them...]

(;B[ih];W[ig];B[id];W[ii];B[tt]C[hoang> yeah he tried to play on to make you make mistakes but thats good you defended well.  there is no way to get points from that unless he puts more stones in than you defend with!  when you get good you will know how to do that.

pn> I thought it was quite reasonable to pass here.
pn> If White had stopped here he had also won +3.5...
pn> I guess White was hoping for my mistakes (not a bad idea generally ;-)
pn> could I have defended in such a way that he had lost more points than
pn> I lost territory?];W[hb]
