C[I did this review on Cgoban. If u could download it, it's a great SGF editor, and would make it easier for u to read SGF files. I'm not sure what SGF files are u using, but it's quite messy :)]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[oc]
(;W[dg]LB[cj:A][qn:B]C[This is a light approach to black's  4-4 stone. It's better to respond i think. Playing on topside at F16 seems uninteresting for now, because p17 is on 3rd line. So a pincer seems like a better idea. Joseki is at C10. IF you want to play on the right side, i would R6 instead]
;B[pj];W[fc]C[White plays double attack on 4-4];B[fd]LB[cf:A]
TR[fc][dg]SQ[fd]C[Contact move (attaching) like this one is usually seen when a 4-4 is attacked from 2 sides. Purpose is to gain strength by attacking one side, to attack the other side. How to choose which side to attach to? Proverb is : Contact the stronger stone, to attack the weaker stone.   If D13 is at C14 instead, we can choose to attach at D14, then gain strength to attack F17, i put down a variation. But here, even after gaining strength by attacking F17, it's hard for black to attack D13 for 2 reason. First, it's on 4th line, secondly it's not close by.]
;W[dc]C[This is bad move for white i think. First of all, it leaves cut. Second, there's a saying, "when touched, touch back". White should G16.]

(;B[gc]C[This weak moves just creates more cut for white to attack. Black should punish severely by playing E17.]

(;W[fb]C[this feels like a passive move.. White should play E16 and creates cuts on black's shape]
;B[gb];W[cd];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[ce]C[shoudn't have extended here, should he? makes cut too easy.

Yes. White shape crumbles after this];B[db];W[cb]C[Don't know what hes thinking here either]
;B[cc];W[da]C[Don't know if I should've conceded or hung D18, but hes makes another blunder right after this, I think]
;B[dc];W[bc];B[fa];W[bb]
(;B[ea]C[This is bad move. No need to capture. White can't save them, So Black pratically passed 1 move]
;W[jp]C[Heres where I screw up 9 out of 10 times. I've gotten fairly decent at reading the short-term, but when the fights over, I don't know where to go next

As i said, Black practically throw away 1 move. Since the game is still in beginning, There's plenty of chance for white to catch up. This is a good fast play by white.]
;B[qq]TR[cn][qn]C[Way too early for 3-3.  This helps white to develop even bigger moyo. Approaching from these 2 points seems better]

(;W[qp]C[White chose the wrong way to extend. If white has Q3 instead, black is very bad. See the variation]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[rq]C[Was this a mistake, or was my reply a mistake?

Joseki is S4, but not really much white can do even then.   Since white chose the wrong direction to extend, he couldn't get good result. White's wall is facing black Q10, so it's practically has no value in exchange for the points black got in the corner]
;B[rr];W[ro];B[mq]C[I'm thinking this is too small, and I should go somewhere else, but something was worrying me. CAn't remember what now

Nikken :  This is actually very big. there is a proverb "Hane on 2 stones if possible"]
;W[sr]
(;B[rs]C[I think this was a mistake too

R2 may lose 1 point or two, but don't leave as much ko threat.]
;W[mp]
(;B[lq]C[I extended cause I figured he was planning to atari, but could I have one hopped or two hopped and not worried about it?

Don't give white too many cutting points if u can. no purpose in jumping one or two. When your group is okay, go to next big point.

Variation shows a thing that even though doesn't work now, can give white lots of ko threat. And if white has played t3, the variation works great for white]
;W[lp];B[jq]C[no purpose on this move
just play big point when your group is okay];W[iq];B[kp]C[bad move on my part, but I couldn't see the best spot to go too]
;W[kr]
(;B[ip]C[if u're not sure what lies ahead, best to fix a peep. Variation shows what happen if black fixed]
;W[kq];B[jo];W[mr]LB[lr:A][mr:B]C[Sorry. I hate this variation garbage. I can't ever get it work. While I'm playing I usually try out short-term plans. didn't realize it save all of them. Can't figure out how to delete them]
;B[ms]LB[lr:B][ms:A];W[lr];B[pr]C[Trying to defend agisnst losing the rest of the corner.

Corner is dead]
(;W[qs];B[ql]C[small play.

U have to learn to find big points on board. Left side is very big and very ready for points]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq]C[Again, white chose the wrong way to extend. C4 is better]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cl];B[dr];W[er];B[ds]C[Seems weak, but trying to go under at E1 would've screwed me.

Connecting at C2 is correct];W[eq];B[br]C[this is not necessary if black has played C2]
;W[bm];B[am]C[this is really bad move.];W[al];B[an]C[White can play B4 later in end game, very big]
;W[jc]C[This feels very attackable]
(;B[jd]C[do not touch weak stone. don't attack  to kill. Attack to gain profit. Look at variation]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[kc]C[Don't know whos making more mistakes. Me or him]
;B[ic];W[nb];B[nc];W[ob];B[pb]C[I was hoping to use my old group to try and kill his white, but I think I just handed him territory.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[bp]C[Can't beleive I missed that];B[ap];W[ao]

C[And I didn't save before another 100 moves had passed. It ended with my resigning because I lost that whole group on the north edge. Besides, I have more mistakes in my first fifty moves than you can shake a stick at.]
