;B[jd];W[po];B[np];W[jp]C[This move is not consistent with Q5, if W thinks this is bigger than approaching
at Q5, there is no reason to play Q5 first...];B[qp];W[on]C[These two white stones are heavy. They have no easy way of forming eyes, so they
will be an ideal target of attack for black. This makes it almost impossible for white
to reduce the black framework in the upper right. If W plays Q5 and leaves it, he should
not continue like this, but must treat it lightly and play elsewhere.]

a big mistake or anything, just my personal opinion)];W[mn]

(;W[dq]C[Wrong block ..  The other block would get the two black stones above in trouble, and
The white stone at G4 is too close to the white strength to be efficient...]

(;B[mc]C[Too timid, should pincer the W stones instead (at R12 or Q12)]
;W[qh];B[gc];W[fh]C[very vague... white should try to attack the O9 and Q9 stones to form some points in
the center, I think N9...];B[oh]C[Good! Black strengthens his only weak stones. At this point there is no hope for white,]
;W[oe];B[od];W[rj];B[lq];W[ko];B[do]C[I think it is more important to strengthen the three black stone on the right... M9 seems
to both strengthen the group and reduce whites potential territory in the center.]
;W[eo];B[dn];W[en];B[ir]C[very big. White E6 was not so important.]
;W[el];B[fq];W[fp];B[lk]C[So black got this move anyway. This was the urgent point that should have been played
by both sides for the past few moves...];W[gq]C[Biggest endgame points  are B10, R5 and K9... G3 seems not so big... Anyway, white only
hope seems to be some kind of invasion at the top, like L16...]

C[This is wrong. Forcing W to connect cannot be good. If black H17, white has to connect
F16 and black has sente...];W[fd];B[gf]C[This leaves the W endgame at H17 which is very big...]
;W[ih];B[gb]C[So black ends in gote (locally) instead of sente,,, This makes all the difference, white
can now attach the center black stones.];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk]C[This is too slow... Should attack center]

;W[ke]C[At the end, black wins by 18.5

To sum up, white's biggest mistakes was to make a heavy group at the start by playing
Q5 and leaving it and to block from the wrong side at D3. R15 was also very bad
Black's biggest mistakes was
to allow P9 and to go for profit instead of strengthening the center when he was ahead.
Also black didn't punish white nearly enough for playing R15.

In the endgame, many mistakes were done by both players, but the game was not close
so it didn't really matter...

I guess my best advice is this:
 - Urgent moves before big moves
In the endgame this translates to:
 - Blocking your opponent sente is worth twice as much a normal gote play.]
