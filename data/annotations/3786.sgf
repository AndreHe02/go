C[I won, by a lot actually, but a lot of that seemed to come from life and death issues. I'm trying to get away from the "play where your opponent played last" syndrome and go for the big points, even if they might locally not be the best.

* So please help me to identify big points i missed
* also, i think i played the lower right cored pritty badly. how could I (white) have done this better and how could my opponent have taken advantage of my play
* move #90, too slow?

Thanks in advance for all the comments you could giv me


Hello peltco,

I will review your game. You can find me on KGS (if you play there) as Tobamf or LeehungLo. I am around 7k. Please keep in mind that I am going to offer alternatives, which are probably just as naive to a 1d as a 1d's alternatives are to a 8d. The best and fastest way to get to 10k in my experience is simply to play a lot. 3 games/day will get you there within 2 months probably.]

peltco [18k?\]: have a good game
walasek [19k\]: hi gl];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[This might be a bit advanced, but pros say the two star point opening you have made means you are going for an influence oriented game. To use this opening to form territory is a bad strategy (remember, this is all from books written by pros). I think you should consider this an FYI for the moment and not worry about it.]

;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[kd]C[this move at L16 is nice. It is said that when you have a two point wall (like your white group at P18/P17), you can extend 3 spots away from it, which you did. You also moved to L16, which not only gives you good access to the middle for the later game, but serves to connect H17 to P17. In Go, connecting is equivalent to "united we stand" and getting cut is equivalent to "divided we fall."]

Try and compare the move in your mind to black playing there. This will give you a good idea of how many points its worth, whether it has a lot of influence, whether it makes a group live and thus whether the move is slow or not.]
