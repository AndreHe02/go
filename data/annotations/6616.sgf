C[Hello, I'm Bernd, HonFu on KGS and in the Ladder. This time I was playing as treespirit.



I have put questions into the game. Please correct my moves and also my thinking. I also would be happy about some hint how and what I should study from now on.



Thank you very much!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cj];W[od];B[mc]
;W[qc]C[H.: Here I just started a joseki. I was not sure if it is good or not, or how exactly to choose a joseki fitting to this situation. I had a variation in mind, and exactly that variation will stand on the board later, but I will not be happy with it when it's there ..

janr: .in the most common variation white gets influence on the right side and black gets thick towards the top side.  Given the positions of white's and blacks adjacent corners this limits the expansion of both sides.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qb];W[rc];B[ob];W[mb]
C[H.: Here. I thought: When there's a black shimari in the upper left, then I would bend around here as the ladder works, and prevent thickness working well with the shimari. So I thought: I don't want him to get thickness facing my hoshi, so maybe that variation fits here too ..

janr: the variation seems possible to me..];B[qe];W[pf];B[rb]
;W[oa];B[pb];W[lc];B[md];W[ld];B[mf]
(;W[pe]LB[pe:B][nf:A]C[janr: I would prefer the variation (A is a vital point while B makes an empty triangle)]
;B[le];W[qf];B[rd];W[re];B[sc];W[jd];B[ke]C[janr: black makes good shape and white gets heavy on the right]
;W[hc]LB[id:A][je:B][jg:C]C[H.: This is what happened. and now it seems that this group is not working well with my hoshi stone. What should I have done instead, and how would I think to find that out in a game?

janr: locally i prefer to play at A.  this leaves no black forcing moves around B and aims at building further around C.  It also works on slightly larger scale in combination with the hoshi.
My major concern is still the heavy group on the right.];B[pj]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[og]LB[nh:B][oh:A]C[janr: I prefer to play at A. this avoids a forcing move at B and allows therefore white to run faster towards the center]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[mj];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok]C[janr: pushing from behind over the fourth line is very painful]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[qo];W[ml];B[kj];W[ch]LB[hc:E][dd:F][cf:A][ch:D]
[cn:B][kq:C]C[H.: Since he comes in at C17 directly after my check, should I have checked from below instead? Or was L3 bigger?

janr: I think A and B can be considered miai for black.  C is clearly a big move.  The D-E-F construction has the 3-3 point open.  after a 3-3 invasion, D-E-F is worth much less than the 3 stones invested I think.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]LB[cb:F][hc:A][be:C][ce:B][de:E][bf:D]C[janr: The standard sequence will not give white a good result.
One can see this now already (A is too close to the wall).  Therefore, I would examine variations such as B/C/D, E and F]

(;W[ce];B[be]
(;W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[fc]LB[fc:C][hc:A][id:B][cm:D]C[H.: Too overconcentrated to bare - In my 2k-feeling at least. The black center group seems not likely to be attackable all too profitably. At least I would not know where or how to start.

janr: I would still prefer A at B.  Connecting at C feels very slow but unfortunately probably necessary.  Maybe D is a good alternative]
;B[cn]C[H.: He even got sente to extend from his stone.];W[fp]
LB[ch:B][cl:A]C[janr: white is strong around B, so i would prefer to attack at A.]
;B[en];W[jq]LB[cq:E][hq:D][iq:A][kq:B][lq:C]C[janr: I would prefer A or B.  The game move allows black to make the larger extension to C, to make the invasion at D and to make the invasion at E.]
;B[lq];W[jo]LB[hp:A]C[janr: I would stupidly defend at A.];B[hq]
;W[hp];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[cp]C[H.: Somehow he invades every of my positions. I know, walls are good, but are the black groups really still weak enough to be attacked profitably? How should I have prevented this result?

janr: walls are only good if there are weak groups to attach.]
;B[fq];W[cq]LB[gq:A]C[janr: A looks like an urgent place.];B[iq]
;W[jp]LB[ip:A]C[janr: A is better];B[ip];W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[jr]
;W[kr];B[is]LB[hn:A][jn:B]C[janr: now two cutting points A and B remain]
;W[kq];B[cr];W[br];B[ds]C[H.: Okay, so I have surrounded him somewhat and weakened the lower right a bit, but I think I have to use this wall for a good purpose now, if still possible. Not even time to guard at H6 or K6.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[bk]C[janr: black can capture this stone easily.]
;B[bj];W[dk];B[ck];W[bo]LB[ei:B][dn:A]C[janr: I would cut off at A.  It makes a few points and connects the white stones.  later, attacking is still possible, or playing B will force black to spend a move to live.]
;B[dn];W[hm];B[gn];W[hn];B[ej];W[fl];B[dj];W[fm]LB[fk:A][gk:B]
C[janr: A is better (or maybe B?)];B[gj]C[H.: Now I desperately started a splitting attack, that maybe it might be already too late for a successful split.]
;W[ij];B[gl];W[gm];B[ik];W[jk];B[jj]
(;W[hk]LB[ii:A]C[janr: there is white thickness at the top, so if white wants for fight, A looks like a sensible idea.]
;B[ii];W[hj];B[hi];W[gi];B[hl]
(;W[il]LB[fj:A]C[If white is really desparate, he could try the sacrifice at A.]
;B[gk];W[ik];B[fi];W[gh];B[fh];W[gg];B[dg]TR[fh][fi]C[janr: killing black is now very difficult as black played the marked stones in sente]

;W[je];B[kf];W[ih];B[ng];W[ne];B[me];W[lk];B[lj];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[ni];B[mi]C[H.: So my opponent lived everywhere, and he's ahead in actual territory. playing something like F14 seems too gote for me, especially since I still have walls which I should try to put to a use.]

(;W[pr]LB[qp:A]C[janr: this move aims mainly at making some small territorial points, not at attacking.
I would prefer A];B[or];W[oq];B[qr];W[pp];B[qq];W[nr];B[ps]
;W[op]C[janr: walls are not intended to make territory but to attack.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[po];W[nn];B[oo];W[no];B[om];W[nm]C[H.: So I used the walls to take 20 points. But his right side also solidified.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[ns];W[mr];B[ff];W[ee];B[fg];W[al]C[H.: I hoped for some chance to still kill, but it was not possible as it seems.]
;B[bl];W[ri]C[H.: So I switch to this side, trying to rumble into it as far as I can.]
