AB[pd][dp]C[Hi reviewer! First game I've ever had reviewed, thanks so much. I won this but that matters much less to me then learning from the mistakes I made/moves I don't know how to answer correctly. =)

I'm learning on my own. I've dipped lightly in a lot of areas but haven't had the time to deeply study any one thing yet. I've studied a small-to-medium amt. of:
-life&death and tesuji from the James Davies series
-general stuff on liberty counting from a few sources
-working through Janice Kim's incredible Learn to Play Go series currently, particularly her guidelines on shape, fighting, opening, and endgame.
-------------------
Ok. I will do my best.
You made great efforts
to explain your thinking,
so it was easy for me 
to make this review.];W[dd];B[pq];W[pc]C[--------------------
White makes a contact move
but there is no reason.]
(;B[qc]C[Attach, hane, I know. Was this in the wrong direction, though? I was worried he could take the cornor if I played P17, but this way I feel like he's able to link up the entire north side.

------------------
see  variation];W[oc];B[qd]C["Hit 2 on the head" (at P16) is the other shape I know. Would that have been better? I was worried about getting cut. I also thought this was simpler (less fighting) which is good when I have advantage, like HC game?

----------------------
I agree.];W[mc];B[ph]C[3rd or 4th line better, or was it just my preference?

----------------
preference I think];W[kc]C[Am I happy here, or did I lose some of my "2 stone HC" lead?

--------------------
White should not play so low.];B[qo]C[Trying to follow "Close unbalance corners" guideline

--------------------
May be this is a bit slow.
I woud attack at C14.
But on the other hand
your move is secure.];W[cq]C[-----------------------
You played the 4-4 stone,
so you should be happy,
when White invades.


see next variation]
(;B[cp]C[I feel like this cuts him off from the NW corner stone, and drives him a little towards my strong SE corner.

I worry though that maybe I'm risking these 2 stones being cut off from the SE grp instead.

I also considered:
-Blocking other side, D3: I have backup in that direction, but if he goes C4 then I worry he can connect to that north stone and get an entire side again.


-------------------------
see variation];W[dq];B[eq]C["hit 2 on the head", good?

----------------------
yes];W[er]C[Don't know how to answer tho. Agresivly attack the C and D stones with B3 or something?

pulling back the E3 stone protects it some, but gives him more wiggle room on the bottom]
;B[fq];W[fr]C[In retrospect, I think I was focusing on killing the 3-3 invasion, which I know is bad.

Should I have continued this, letting white "push from behind" as long as he wanted? (bG3, wG2, bH3, wH2, etc.) He'd have been locking down territory, but only from 2nd line, and I'd have that huge wall pointing at the middle.

(Again, I think that's good in principal, but I still don't know enough to be able to use it well, or even be sure it's correct)  ;)]

(;B[bq]C[------------------
That is too aggressive.
You can not destroy 
the white corner.

see variation];W[gq]C[----------------
now White can punish you.];B[cr]C[---------------------
small];W[dr]C[Still being obsessed with trying to make a killable shape from life and death, which I now think was the wrong way to do it.

-----------------
yes];B[gp]C[Thinking was: if he atari's the E,F stones, I'll connect the other one, which would save them and atari him back]
;W[hq];B[jq]C[Now he's up to the 3rd line again, AND was extending east. I wanted to stop him from moving East OR up.

In retrospect, I don't think I could stop both, and I should have aimed at blocking the east and building strength while I chased him a bit into the center?

----------------
yes];W[hp];B[go]C[I think this was good? Protect my black group, and threaten to cut him off from center]
;W[br]C[-----------------
This is small.];B[ar]C[-----------------
This is small as well.];W[cs]
(;B[ap]C[I thought this was a good exchange for me, but I'm not sure.
Thinking was: I lost a stone and he gained an eye, but I stole some cornor territory by pushing down and gave this black group protection from some of the cuts I was worried about.

----------------------
see variation];W[dj]C[---------------------
Now White gets this big point :(]
(;B[dl]C[Thinking: I need to protect the black group, and stop his push south. I wasn't sure wether to attach or not though

(although in retrospect I think I should have, since this was mostly "defending" the black group I think, and I have a very vague understanding of "defend with contact plays, attack with non contact ones")


------------------
see variation];W[dh];B[ho]TR[jq]C[Thinking: this is still best area to play in, I think W and B side groups are pretty solid everywhere else. I should cut off his grp from center

Retrospect: I think this would have been better at J5 (or maybe J6) though. Would that have worked out better, or would he still have been able to punch his way through?
---------------------
Black cannot stop White,
because the marked stone 
is too weak.];W[ip];B[jo]C[Trying to jump ahead and cut him off, but I think it failed because I left too many stones as just 1 single stone, vulnerable to the atari-then-punch-through W kept using against me.]
;W[jp];B[kp]C[Best I can do at this point? Or should I have given up on one of those stones? (K3 or K5)]
;W[ko];B[lq]C[One of the black stones gonna get atari'd either way. I decide to protect the SE side.

I tried to make good shape. Would this have been better at L3 or M4 or elsewhere though?]
;W[io];B[jn]C[I thought of other things, like J6, but I thought the upcomming exchange was the best I could do. Protect my SE and W black groups, but he gets to push out strong into the center.]
;W[in];B[kn];W[il];B[hm]C[Thinking: this protects B group, and also forces him to connect so I don't "lose" my turn]
;W[im];B[lo]TR[kn][jn][jo]C[I had to decide between this and G7 or H6. I was worried about the 3 stones (at K5) if this white stone ran out though, and thought this was more important

----------------------
May be H8 is more urgent.

In such a situation
risking the marked stones
can be the right decision.];W[hl]C[I was more worried he'd push in at H6 or clamp at G7 here. This let me make good shape with next move, and also protect that B group further.

I'm not sure though];B[gm]C[Now G5 and G7 groups can't be cut off from eachother, I think B is happy here?

------------------
Don't forget 
the bamboo joint 
is only sure 
when it has liberties
on the outside.];W[gl];B[bk]C[Thinking: extend AND protect my base, AND threaten W west stones. Or atleast steal territory from them

-----------------------
Your group has 
too many defects
so may be F8 is better.];W[fm]C[--------------
Wake up,
White is attacking 
your bamboo joint.];B[fl]C[I wasn't sure how to answer this. Thing was I was strong enough to cut off that white stone, But I forgot the cut at F4 would force a reply, and then black is running out of liberties.]
;W[fp];B[ep]C[I considered F5, sacrificing the 2 black stones but protecting everything else and capturing the F7 to make up for it a little.

I'm not sure if it would have played out like that though, and was worried he'd be able to cut somewhere and kill the entire black group]
;W[fo];B[fn]C[I think this was as strong as I could do here. Couldn't save all the black stones, but ended up trading 2 for 2 at least]
;W[hn];B[eo];W[gn];B[em]C[I think this is good shape, AND atari too. (although since G7 didn't threaten much, I expected him to leave the white stone to die or live later and play somewhere else.

I feared:
-invasion in the Q9 area, or
-underneath in the K1 area or around there.

I mostly expected though that W would close off the west side at B11 or B10.]
;W[gm]C[---------------------
This is very small.];B[bi]C[Again, I couldn't decide if this was more important or if I needed to seal off the 2 places I mentioned a move ago (east or mid-south sides).

I thought this move was more important though since it ate a lot of white territory (I think), and might threaten the D10 and D12 stones

I also wasn't sure if it was safe to push in any further?

-----------------
This is dubious, ...];W[bh]C[-------------------
... because White's defense 
makes an invasion at 3-3
more and more difficult 
for Black.];B[bg]C[I expected wC12, then I would go underneath, bA12. I'm not positive that would have worked, but I think I could have kept everything conected that way and continued to eat into white territory.]
;W[bf];B[ch];W[cg];B[ah]C[I think this is good for black. Not sure if it could be better though, or if it's actually bad.]
;W[ci];B[bh]C[I really didn't know what to do here. I think strong players would do the ko thing and play C10 or C14. I'm not very aware of how that works yet though. Particularly I don't know what kinds of things I would do, if any, to make threats here.

I am pretty sure that black 5 stone mess became ugly though :(]
;W[df];B[qk]C[I finally sealed off this side. I'm not sure if I had to, but I feared an invasion here.

In retrospect I have a lot of stones on the 3rd line, and maybe this should have been on the 4th.

However, even on the 3rd line I couldn't stop what happened next...]
;W[qh]C[I'm not positive but I'm -pretty- sure that this white stone has no business living. Would equal strength players play this and expect to have any chance of living?

If so, then I fought too hard to kill it.

But if it shouldn't be able to live with that much Black around it, then I'd love help knowing in the next few moves how better to have killed it.]

(;B[qg]C[Should I have gone other direction?

------------------
see variation];W[qi];B[pi]C["Hit 2 on the head" shape. Also driven very close to the R9 stone. I really don't think these W stones should have lived if we were both equally skilled. Is that a bad assumption though?]
;W[qj]
(;B[pj]C[I think this is right, anything better?

------------------
see variation];W[rk];B[ql]C[I just don't know how to answer here. This is feeling like the early fight in SW again. Hane again would let him atari at R8, bQ9, wS7 atari, black is boned.

Sliding down though meens he geets to slide with, making more space, making the group more likely to live.]
;W[rl]C[Although I played the next move, I think maybe it should have been S7. W couldn't cut that, and I THINK I could kill the white shape that finished forming, although I'm not sure.

I'm going to play out a variation, although I'm not sure if it's kosher for the reviewEE to do that? (or does it make the file hard for the review to comment on or anything?)

After variations: Everything I tried white lives, although I may be missing something. Is there really no way to have stopped this?]

(;B[rh];W[ri];B[si];W[rj];B[sg]C[Actually, this looks pretty good. A later atari at T10 could even be ignored (I think).

Somehow W still lived from here though...];W[qm];B[pm]C[I don't know if this is a mistake, but can't find something better.

-----------------------
This is ok];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro]C[It's just getting really complex/hard for me. I think if I stay calm at this point I just have to stop that lower "tenticle" of the white group from reaching friends or making an eye. I think that's doable if I don't make a mistake, but I'm not sure

--------------------
Black should have 
more confidence
and drive the white stones against his strong wall.];W[pn];B[om]
;W[on]
(;B[mn]TR[qk][ql][pm][om]C[---------------------
This is the mistake:

You are strengthening
a strong group
and leave the marked stones 
weak.

see variation];W[nm]C[:(  B in trouble now I think];B[nn];W[pl]
;B[ol]C[Trying to minimize damage by walling him off at least]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[sj]C[The move W makes now 
he aparently knew 
he needed for life. 

-------------------
Yes, White must make 
his second eye.];B[ml]C[Capturing that cutting stone, I think.

I think this is more important then walling up white around P5?

---------------------
yes];W[op]
(;B[pp]C["Prevent the bamboo joint", I think. If wP5 though I think he still would have weaseled through for a while with atari's


-------------------
see variation];W[oq];B[oo]C[Thinking: divide W up. I was worried about possible trouble for B though]
;W[po];B[no]C[Have to connect or P5 was pointless, I think]
;W[pr]C[I was unhappy playing O5 last move though because here I feared he'd cut at R4. I'm not positive what happens then, but I don't see a lot of B liberties in what I can read out, and it looks scarry

I variationed it out and it looks like B survives the cut if he doesn't make a mistake. I think?]
;B[qr]C[Cutting W at P2 would be nice but doesn't work, not sure if there's anything better then this next bit. It feels like black's losing liberties and the lone white grp is getting a dangerous ammount of them though. Again, not sure though.]
;W[or]
(;B[qq]C[I don't know if this was actually necessary. 

--------------------
see variation];W[jj];B[mg]C[I'm trying to protect against a cut at P10 w/ ladder breaker, and expand black territory at same time.

Not sure if there was a better choice though. I think L13 might have been better, but I'm not sure if it would have got cut away from B and isolated]
;W[kg]C[I should mention something. Even though the game ended by like 25 point difference, I can't tell that at all from here. I was worried things were even, or that the big north'ish white space and his 2 live grps cutting up black space made me think W might be ahead.

Is there any way to learn from that, or to practice estimating without being off by so much?]
;B[le]C[Not sure if there's something stronger];W[ke];B[lf]
C[he attached, but had backup on either side, I wasn't sure how to do this. I thought this would be threatening to cut off at L14 and would require an answer.]
;W[ki]C[------------------
White should defend at L14];B[kf];W[jf];B[je];W[ie];B[kd]C[I was happy for B until next move]
;W[jd]C[Now, not so happy for B. Not sure what to do here. The shape I end up with is reallllly ugly  :(]
;B[ke]C[Even though that black shape isn't pretty, There's alllll kinds of cutting points on white now, so I thought it was best choice.]
;W[ic];B[jg]C[This got me a white stone and pushed the border in a little further. White's replies seemed to squeeze me into worse and worse dumpling'y shapes though]
;W[if];B[kh];W[ig];B[lg]C[In retrospect I think K12 or something else would have worked out a lot better. It's hard for me to see far enough to tell, though]
;W[jh];B[kg]C[I think M11 would have been better. Good shape, I think, and I could have sacrificed one or two black stones while using the moves to really close down the middle border around L9'ish

(although I'd love to see the strongest suggestions for how to do this, if it's right?)

I made the same "mistake" he did protecting a single stone when another move might have been much more worthwhile]
;W[fk];B[ek]C[I'm not sure why I chose this over conecting or playing somewhere else]
;W[fj];B[ej];W[ei];B[ih]C[This ate a little more W territory, but:
-I'm not sure if it could have done more
-It made B shape even dumpling'y'er
-The middle at around K9 was still open and worrying];W[hh]
;B[ii]C[I was sick of taking an atari'd stone then being forced into a bad shape. This didn't escape that, though.

I also think now that if white had connected the atari'd stone, those 2 black stones would have ended up cut off.]
;W[hi];B[ji];W[ij];B[jh];W[kj];B[cc]C[I wasn't sure if I could connect this to the West black stones, but I was pretty sure I could make it live at the very least

--------------------
Finally the invasion.

May be it is too late,
because this invasion depends
on the possible threat 
of an escape.]
(;W[dc]C[----------------
see variation];B[bc];W[cd];B[be]C[At this point I was pretty sure B could connect for sure]
;W[bd];B[af]
(;W[cf]C[-------------------
see variation];B[ad];W[cb];B[bb];W[ce];B[ae];W[db];B[hj]C[This ended badly. I was trying to (a) somehow force the middle border closed by threatening the J10 stones or something, and (b) to take advantage of the cutting spots at places like G9 and F11.

I don't know if there was a way to make it work, or if I should have just started closing off borders as best I could]
;W[ba]C[-------------------
small];B[ac];W[aa]C[I knew this needed 1 more approach move before I had to answer it

small];B[dn]C[---------------
unnecessary];W[fl]C[----------------
small];B[mi]C[Finally try to lock down middle border. I actually don't know if this is good strategy. Were there more points to be made elsewhere? I was worried I'd give up a lot of points in the middle as he pushed further, and maybe even threatened the life of some of the B groups

I also considered Q18'ish, or O16. Also thought about attacking the SW white group or "spending" a move to be sure the 4 SE white stones couldn't make trouble]
;W[mj];B[nd];W[nc];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[li];B[nj];W[lj]C[Not sure if that was good or bad little exchange]
;B[mh]C[I think this was waisted. Could have just let white atari here, b connect at O11, then play at M12 or O12, whichever one white didn't.

Don't know where the best move is at this point though];W[md]
C[Ok, this next mistake I feel like I make over and over. I'm not sure exactly what's happening. But it feels like I leave 1 stone single, then exchanges happen leading to it being atari'd, and the other side punches through past me.

If I learned anything at all from this game, my first hope would be for some advice on this sort of situation

(altho maybe my best bet was just to connect the weak single stone w/ P16, let white push in only 2 spaces and wall him off at O15 and O14. Would there be something better that sacrificed a bit of B teritory but kept Sente?)]

C[Trying to insure the isolated W grp can't make trouble. This was either way more necessary then I thought it was (since W almost ended up killing B), or else it wasn't strong -enough-, (again, since W almost killed B) :)]
;W[sn];B[so];W[sm]C[Man I thought about my next move. From what I could see I thought that SE B group was safe, but I -was - it might be in trouble in a way I couldn't see.

I decided to trust it was safe and attack the SW white group. I didn't have a ton of hope of killing it, but thought that by threatening I could close the border in a nice way for B]

to cut at J2.];B[ir];W[hr];B[is];W[iq];B[jr];W[ab]C[W forgot the approach move.]
