C[Hello,

thanks for reviewing my game!
I played white and won by  resignation. A lot of moves were  played during a though byoyomi.
After the notation ends black made  some mistakes and rsigned.
I added two comments and two
questions at the end and would be  very pleased if you would tell me  your opinion about them too.

Thanks again,
bye,

;B[bq]LB[dl:a][hp:b]C[Christian:
This is an unusual move. Just sliding into the corner doesn't put much pressure on white, and black still doesn't have two eyes. The usual approaches are counter-attacks with either a or b.]
;W[nq]C[Martin:
After looking up the usual josekis I  feel that I underestimated the  potential weaknesses of both groups  in the lower left.

Christian:
Yes, playing an extension on the lower side looks like the solid approach. But I don't think your move is really bad.]

(;W[ce]C[Don't play attach and block against the double kakari. With 15 already played, the outside influence black gets is superior. As far as I know, extending at 19 is considered the only move.]

(;W[od]C[Christian:
You are right that black should have added another move, but pushing through is not the best way to exploit this - you are pushing black against your weak stone. Instead you should play on the right side.]
;B[pe];W[qh]LB[re:a]C[Martin:
This group soon became very weak,  but I don´t think it had to. Where  were my mistakes?

Christian: The first problem is that 38 is ineffective. Wouldn't you rather like it at a now (see variations at move 38)?]
;B[og]
(;W[pi]C[Christian: After black 41 it is very difficult to make good shape. Maybe you should better try to live immediately like in the variation.]
;B[pj];W[rd];B[rc];W[re]
(;B[db]C[Christian: An endgame move in the middle of combat? Why doesn't black continue his attack? I would play at the vital point of white's group - white can live, but black gets very impressive thickness.]
;W[oj]C[Christian: Good.];B[ok];W[nk]C[Christian: This is an overplay.]

Even if black were not aware of the ko, inducing this move is terrible. Compare this and the previous variation ...]

(;B[cp];W[gk]C[Christian: Yes, white can't simply connect.]

;W[lc]C[Martin:
Do you agree that the game is still  close?

And one main problem I seem to  have is to realize potential  weaknesses of groups, both my own  and the opponent´s. Can you think of  a way to improve in this field?

Thanks!

Christian: I agree the game is still close (white is slightly ahead, but this depends on who realizes first that a black move at q18 is sente).

Answering your second question is more difficult. I would definitely recommend reading a book like `Attack and Defense´ (is it still available?), but when I look again on the right side, I think practicing tsume-go is also a good idea. Do you know the program uligo by Ulrich Görtz?]
