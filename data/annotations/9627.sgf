C[Dear reviewer,
Firstly, I'd like to know why this game turned out in favour of the oponnent and how I could've prevented that. I'd also like to know if I could improve my fighting skills/techniques. Finally, I've notated my thinking process and my logic behind the moves, and I'd like to know if these thoughts are really correct, or somewhat unreasonable, and on what subject/s I should spend more time studying.
Thanks in advance!

Hi!

On all main branch moves, I've put two stars before any comments from me (like the two above "Hi!" here). All comments on variations are from me, of course.

I'm afraid I don't have any useful advice on improving your fighting technique, except some specific variations and the uselessly general advice to practice reading more; but I've got some more big-picture advice about strategy & attacking (=/= fighting or killing).

I think at the most general level the reason you lost is a lack of attention to the big picture of the board. This comes out in (a) not recognizing how big the opponent's moyos were, (b) not recognizing how big the empty spaces were in comparison with the most recent move, (c) not playing with a consistent strategy, and relatedly (d) not attacking white while she/he is weak.

So general advice to go with this general assessment: if time allows, take a breath before answering the opponent locally, or playing a small move you think requires a local answer, and look at the whole board. Is there something bigger? Does the opponent have a weak group you can harass? Is the opponent ahead on territory, do you need to catch up? What are each of your groups doing (cutting, connecting, making territory, making eyes)? Are some of them expendable? What do you need to do to support them in what they're doing?

More specific comments throughout.

Thanks for sharing your game! I've enjoyed reading it & your thoughts.
Best,

**

I don't feel qualified to comment here.];B[fc]C[I considered making a side-extension at one of the side starpoints, but it seemed to restrained to me, so I approached the white corner immediately.

**

I'm still not qualified yet.];W[jc];B[cf]C[I was a bit unsure of what a common response would be here, with the three-space pincer. I played another corner approach to take away white's base.

**

OK, from here I've got something. Considered in isolation (forgetting the other three corners), the double approach is fine as a response to the three-space pincer; there are joseki from here. So then the quesiton is: do those joseki give black an acceptable result given what's happening in the other three corners?

I think it does: a natural way for white to proceed (see variation) is to attach to the un-pincered stone, giving up the corner in return for a moyo on the top side/attack on the pincered stone. A three-space pincer gives a big enough moyo to be happy with, but its prospects are somewhat blunted by black's 4-4 stone at Q16. So I'd say in context the double approach is reasonable for black.]

(;W[ee];B[cc]C[I thought about moves like F15 or G15 to keep white separated, but B7 would probably come under pressure, stones at F17 wouldn't have a base yet, and the white stone at K17 can extend to N17 or O17, so I took the corner.

**

This seems fine to me.];W[dc]
(;B[cb]C[B18 would probably have been better, because it also settles the black stones in the corner besides threatening to link up with the black stone at F17.

**

I think this is a mistake. As you say, it winds up in gote, but I think B18 also doesn't work out. (See previous variation.)]

(;B[rb]C[Looks a bit small, but probably needed, because black's group looks quite overconcentrated and fragile after white:S17, black:S16, white:S18.

**

If you're worried about black being overconcentrated here, better to extend down the side than just answer white's incursion.]
;W[pc];B[rc]C[I connected here instead of R16, because of white's endgame move at S19.]
;W[od];B[oe]C[I played moves 23 and 25 to gain thickness towards the center.]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[pn]C[Instead of pushing white forward with N14 to get him/her more solidified territory, I did the high-approach to use my thickness in the top right to attempt creating a moyo.

**

OK, this makes a lot of sens to me. Got thickness, make a moyo. But be consistent! If that's the plan, stick to it.

This means that if white pincers the Q6 stone, she/he is *invading your moyo*. That means you should attack the pincer stone, not the corner stone. Your thickness all the way up in the top right corner won't help you attack the bottom right corner, but it can help you attacking a pincer stone on the right side.]
;W[qj]C[I didn't really know what to do with this bothersome pincer, and how to use my thickness to attack, some move around R12 looked too small, and P10 to push white to the side didn't feel good either, so I just double-approached again with O3.

**

Here's a proverb (I think): Play away from thickness.

Applied here, I take this to mean you're right not to play at R12. Another quasi-proverb: use thickness to attack, not to make territory. R12 would be trying to make a tiny amount of territory. Better: try R8. This is how you use thickness to attack: chase the opponent's stones into your thickness, where they'll be in trouble. White's R10 doesn't have quite enough room to make comfortable life extending up the side, and so will run away. Meanwhile, bR8 lets you (1) keep wR10 separated from the bottom corner, and (2) make a small base for bQ6.]
;B[nq];W[np]
(;B[op]C[I intended to create weaknesses in white's shape and to fight.

**

Why? Are you hoping for your opponent to make a mistake, or is there something you think you can get out of the fighting here?

It's still not too late for R8 instead of this move. See variations for some other alternatives.]
;W[oo];B[oq];W[po]C[**

OK, this is why white was happy to have black play P4. That move hopes to create a fight by giving white cutting points, but this cutting point is way bigger than the other one. Black's Q6 is weeping now, and white's R10 is dancing. Plus the corner isn't even secure for black! Black's thickness in the top right is wasted, short of a white collapse around here.

...but it still isn't too late for bR8.];B[pq]C[Seems slow to me, exploiting white's weaknesses by playing atari at N4 or N5 looks better, but most probably N4, N5 seems risky.

**

N4 would make some sense. Start building something to work with D4. But at this point, black should be worried about white's solid, solid stones. The moyo on the top is huge, and thick on both sides, and it's already got territory on the right. There's some aji in black's F17 stone, to be fair. And the moyo on the right is far from being territory, but white should certainly be able to make something live there, which means black's top right corner has to be considered a disappointment.]
;W[mp];B[lr]C[Avoiding being closed in.

**

I'm not sure why it would, especially in light of the next moves. Do you mean you were hoping to avoid being sealed in, but it didn't work out?

Alternatives:
R8
E13 (among other things, a ladder breaker for the cut at O5)
J17
D10
K4
maybe even O5

I think any of these would be better. It's still too early to slide to the 2nd line, unless it's a matter of life or death--and this isn't.]
;W[kq];B[lq]C[I did this to create the cutting point at L4, although it now looks a bit useless, as both white groups can make bases easily, a move like G3 seems good enough.

**

This move is indeed useless. See variation in a moment: white would be happy for you to cut at L4, even if he/she gives up the fight. But it's worse than that: it's not even sente, I think. What happens if white ignores it? The board is still pretty open on the left side, at least; so suppose white plays there and you get a free follow up, presumably at M4. Then white loses the L3 stone, but isn't about to die here.

But I'm not sure about G3. What would it aim to do? Presumably, some combination of (1) help D4 make points, and (2) stop white creeping along the bottom side. But

(1) The corner would still be very much open; better to use something like D9/D10 to make a grand moyo with the D4 stone. 4-4 doesn't make territory easily.

(2) White isn't after the bottom side. L3 doesn't aim at bottom side territory, it aims at building what white has on the right side. This is a wall of a moyo, and it's big enough where it is. If you tenuki, and white decides to play another move in the area, it won't be in the neighbourhood of G3, it'll be in the neighbourhood of P10. (Make boxes, not trays.)]

(;W[lp];B[kp]
(;W[jq];B[ko]C[**

Let's pause here and assess the local situation. There are four groups around the cross cut, all trying to live:

1. Black's M3 group. Solid & safe.

2. White's M4 group. Pretty comfortable. Lots of room to make eyes on the side. Not easily cut, though O5 is a bit of a weakness (white protects it next move).

3. White's L3 group. Weak, but with room to extend on the side. If this group makes life locally, it will have some points.

4. Black's L4 group. Weak and floating in the centre. Black needs this group to live, or the cross cut is no cross cut. Options: (a) run away and connect to something (preferable); (b) make eyes locally. Since it's in the centre, making life locally won't yield significant points.

This is great for white. White can lean on black's weak group to make life for white's own weak group, and in the process will make territory without black gaining compensation. This suggests the cut at L4 (which is only really a cut if we get into this situation, where the cutting stones try to live) was a bad idea for black.]
;W[mn];B[km]C[Perhaps it's better to play H4 to prevent white getting comfortable, I don't know for sure.

**

This move and H4 both look like single-purpose moves to me. H4 stops white extending along the side, but makes things difficult for black's weak group. The actualy move, L7, puts no pressure on white's weak group. (Nor on white's strong group: it's too solid.) Better to try something in the neighbourhood of J5: put pressure on white's weak group while running black's weak group toward the D4 stone.]
;W[gq];B[eq]C[To prevent white sneaking in the corner, and to let white feel a bit cramped.

**

Reasonable, except the predictable outcome is white will move upward, putting pressure on black's weak floating stones.

Better: let white run into the corner. Go for solidity. You're going to wind up accepting a black wall in return for white life anyway, so hindsight says it'd be better to go after it sooner. But that's hindsight for you!]
;W[jp];B[in]C[White's move seemed slow to me, and so I had the opportunity to jump with J6 to create a somewhat better shape for my floating stones, and to keep white low. I considered move 49 at H6, one further, but that seemed too wide and thin.

**

I like this move. I like H6 better. But I'm not strong enough to say for sure.

I wonder, though: are you thinking of counterattacking white here, or just about making life for your weak stones? You have the gift of a still-not-alive white group. It'd be good to threaten it as much as possible before it gets too solid. I like this move (and H6 even more) because it looks like it allows follow-up moves pressing down on white's eyespace.]
;W[ho];B[hn]C[The same idea still, as with move 49, I didn't really see a good move to kill white, so I intended to stick with this plan to build good shape/influence and keep white low.]
;W[go];B[dn]C[The hane (and on the head of two stones) at G6 looked a bit painful (which white didn't play though), but in the meantime, white was marching towards my corner, which I wanted to strengthen, and so that's what I did.

**

Even if you don't see a way to kill white, you can attack. Attacking doesn't necessarily need to result in death to be successful. In this case, you might aim at reducing white's territory/making more for yourself with a move like F2.

But given you've more or less moved away from attacking white in favour of protecting the corner, C6 might have been better. D6 is better for attacking to the right, but C6 is better for defending the side. And, as we see later, playing on the fourth line here makes it harder to stop white's invasion on the left side.]
;W[qg];B[ml]C[White's move at S14 looked like a better way to attack my group (plus sente), and so I thought that it would be bad to just defend. Consequently, I jumped in with N8 to prevent white forming a moyo, reduce territory, and probably the most important thing I had in mind: using the aji of the black stone at Q6 to attack the lower part of white's group.

**

On the other hand, white's actual R13 takes territory, and stabilizes the R10 stone. Attacking your group at S14 just invites you to run into white's moyo on the side--bad news for white.

Now, I like that your move here (N8) is pushing into white's moyo, and threatening to do something with the Q6 stone. However, I think it's a bit too timid. Better to do something like Q9 or R9 or P8: trying to run out with the Q6 stone rather than pushing in and threatening to link up with it.]
;W[ln]
(;B[kn]C[I thought about saving the cutting stones with move 57 at K5, but I wanted to be sure about erasing my weaknesses once and for all. Therefore, I just plainly connected with L6.

**

You might also consider abandoning the cutting stones. If the two white groups you're cutting apart are both going to live, then cutting them achieves nothing. See variation.]
;W[nl];B[nm]C[I think this is a bad move, it does cut white, but a hane the other way around would've been safer and more useful, I believe.

**

Yes, definitely hane on the other side. The cross cut is very bad for you here: O7 and Q6 are going to have a very difficult time surviving if white cuts your hane.]
;W[mm]
(;B[om]C[Just too much of a fighting spirit, I presume, the atari at N9 looks good enough for white.

**

If you're going to try to live on this side of the cross cut, better to abandon the other side (the N8 stone. See variation.]
;W[pk];B[mk]C[Black's move 63 at P9 popped in my head, but that would lead to nothing but black's destruction, so I played 63, and anticipated to play P9 next.]
;W[ok]
(;B[nk]C[A slack forcing move which weakens the aji of the 3 captured black stones. I did this move because I wanted to better protect the cut at M8, whilst giving more help to the black group above. Maybe L9, G6 or F7 would've been better.

Why worry about the cut? See variation.

The left side is still wide open & huge. Better to tenuki and play around D10.]
;W[ol];B[gn]C[F7 feels like better shape.

I'd still prefer something around D10, but this is consistent with your wall-building.

;W[fq];B[er];W[fo];B[fn]C[Probably too protective, white at F6 wouldn't be so awful for black.

**

Agreed.];W[fr]
(;B[ge]C[I wanted to toss white's stones in the top left towards my newly gained thickness, but the knight's move leaves an obvious cut. I considered two other options: the diagonal and the one-point jump to the right. The diagonal seems fine, because of black:G16, white:G15, black:H15, or black:G16, white:G14, black:H14. The final result after such variations look favourable for black. Variation for 1-space jump: black:H17, white:G16, black:G17, white:H16, black:J17, white:J16, black:E18, white:D19, black:K18, white:L17, black:L18, white:M18, black:J19, black lives. The diagonal feels better though, because it does a better job at keeping white separated, and directing his/her group towards black's thickness.

**

I've put these suggestions into variations, with alternatives and comments.

I think it's better to think more desperately: make contact, make a fight. Try attaching at J17, for example.

Trying to push white into your thickness makes sense, except that your thickness is very far away. Your group to the right is very weak, so you're going to have trouble following white on both sides (even more than would be usual), so white is probably going to be able to settle her/his group on the left side, even if things go ideally for you along the way.]

I think this is an overplay by white.];B[hf];W[he]
(;B[if]C[Move 81 at F14 or G16 looks so much better, black at J14 makes the inside black group weaker, and the outside stronger, while black is already strong enough on the outside.

**

Yes, I think F14 is the only move. Remember your plan: You're trying to herd white's D16 group down to your wall in the bottom centre. You're *not* trying to attack white's H15 or L17 stones. Sacrificing H14 is OK, given your plan.]
;W[ff];B[id]C[This jump came to me during my reading, it looked fancy, and not too risky, so I played it.]

Black's stones on the left are surely dead. This does force white to extend to H17, but that doesn't gain anything for black. Just one more dead stone here.]
;W[hc];B[jd]C[To reinforce my shape, and threaten the cut at J17.

**

Maybe this is reasonable if you're committed to keeping the J14 group alive. But why commit to those stones? What are they doing for you?

They aren't cutting. They aren't connecting. They aren't making territory.

Better to tenuki. Playing around here, trying to make shape for these few stones, just makes the group heavy.

It might be worth a reminder that territory in the centre is always less than it looks like.]

;W[hh];B[jh]C[**

Now that the group above is so heavy (five stones!), it's too big to die. So this move is forced.

I'm not sure white would respond like this. Something calmer seems called for--black is deep behind enemy lines here.]
