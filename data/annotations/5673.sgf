C[H: This is a review for both sides, and I have been asked to comment more extensively on the fuseki. However, I don't understand enough of Josekis, so I will do this analysis in more abstract terms of influence vs. territory.

My comments are marked with "H".

Hannes];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp]C[H: All the corners are played on. White choose the hoshis (4-4) while black played komoku (3-4). The 4-4 is influence oriented, while the black tends to building territory.

If the first four moves said anything about the game following, we should expect white playing large moves building moyo, and black carefully extending his territory, while trying to reduce white's.

But no game ist that straight.];B[od]LB[oc:A][od:D][pj:C][qj:B]
C[H: The most stable extension, giving secure territory, and a stable base for further extensions on B or C, is A.
D is in no way wrong. Compared to A it gives more points (if the corner is secured later), but leaves the corner open to the left.]
;W[de]LB[dc:D][mc:E][de:A][jp:C][jq:B]C[H: White choose the aproaching move at A instead of B/C, so maybe he is not so moyo oriented as the hoshi moves seemed to tell.
A is a common approach to the black 3-4. And there are several ways, this could continue (cf. http://senseis.xmp.net/?34PointJosekis#toc2).

I will not go into joseki here, but how does the situation in this aread now look like?

D does not secure the corner. And it does not yet make territory at the upper side. 
The upper right corner (E) is still open.

A prevents black from extending D easily. However, it is also a very lonesome stone.]
;B[dg]LB[dc:A][fe:C][dg:B]C[H: black wants to make profit of this loneliness by pincering the attacker. He probably hopes of chasing white while building walls himself.
A and B are still not strong themselves, so black will have to put white under permanent pressure until A and B are settled. Otherwise, white will use his stronger position (after running) to attack one of them.

When pincering like that, black has at least to think of how to deal with the situation if white make a jump at C.

How to keep on pressing white, then?

(Again: there *are* Joseki on this approach, but as my sources tell, they are played rarely, and not part of every Joseki book. Black will have to think for himself.)]
;W[fe]C[H: Very common reaction to pincer attacks];B[fg]LB[dc:A]
[gc:G][mc:I][cd:E][de:C][he:B][dg:F][fg:D][jj:H][jq:J]C[This move seemed like wrong timing. Perhaps K10 would be better? Or something to suport the D17 stone? I don't know the fuseki for this.

H: This move leaves A alone, and white is not forced  to continue at B. Playing D leaves A in much danger.

Other possible moves would be: 
E, which secures both, the corner and A.
Or G, helping A while putting pressure on white

Playing Tengen (H) is typically not recommended for players your (or my) strength. If black really wants to ignore the white move (which he should not), extending the upper right corner (I), or playing at the lower side (J) would be possible.]
;W[cc]LB[cd:A][ed:B]C[H: Here's the attack, the black stone being virtually surrounded by whites. The contact move (with a possible cut at A), however is difficult to read out. 

This holds for black as well. He must decide on whether to save his stone. Playing B would show this spirit (see variation)]

(;B[cd];W[dd];B[ce];W[ec];B[pj]C[H: Good shape];W[qh]LB[qf:A]
[pg:B][qj:C][qm:E][qn:D]C[H: White shows his fighting spirit, as it is not easy to live here, if black attacks (See variation for a possible outcome)

Black has several options to respond to this move:
A - pressure on white
B - Pressure, but with the aim of sealing white off the center
C - Pressure on white, and preparation of black extension at D or E]

(;B[ip]LB[qh:A][pj:B][ip:C][iq:D]C[H: black decides to ignore. So white is able to either strenghthen A (black B becoming a weak stone), or trying to settle on the side. I would not recommend that black move.

And concerning C, I think a line lower would be better for invading. It is nto easy to settle yourself with C.]
;W[gq];B[lp];W[nq]LB[no:F][lp:A][gq:C][iq:D][lq:E][nq:B]C[H: Black A again: What does this move aim at? White gets his corners secured, while black is neither strong nor settled. D and E would be a good and stable base.

Later, black succeeds in cutting white off the center, but this is due to whites mistakes. White F would make this plan impossible.]
;B[dj]LB[qh:B][cj:A]C[Could I have done something bigger with this move?

H: Again, black is playing on the fourth line, which is not the one to make territory. The black group is open from below, which white can use for extending his corner (see variation). So A would have been better.

Doing somethign about B is still important];W[cm]C[H: Good move, forcing black to respond (which he does not), yielding a double-wing formation in this corner.

Note that is is still open to a 3-3 invasion.]
(;B[kc]LB[qh:B][ck:A]C[H: Good move locally, but A and somethign about B is more important.]
;W[hc];B[mq]TR[ip][lp]C[H: Good idea, to make these loose stones become more important]
;W[nr]C[H: good defense, pressing black to block (which however he does not)]
;B[np]LB[mr:A]C[H: If black aims at sealing white in. this is the right move. In order to get a stable base, A is a must.]
;W[op];B[hq]C[H: this goes into the "make a base" direction. Black seems to be unsure, what to aim at.]
;W[cq];B[gp]C[H: Good move];W[fq];B[fp];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs];B[qm]
LB[qj:A][qm:C][pp:B]C[H: FInally :-)
But now, white B is no longer a alone in the corner. So white does not really have to respong/defend. 

I cannot tell, whether C is too good for white so that black should play it. 
A is still an option.];W[qk]LB[qh:B][qj:D][qk:C][qm:A]C[H: Good double attack. Black will now either split whiteB adn C at  D (loosing black A), or he lets white live at the side.]
;B[pk]C[H: If black decided to go for the center, these moves are very well.]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[qj];B[pn]LB[on:C][no:A][oo:B]C[H: Good move locally. If black really wants the center, he must be aware fo white A then B.
Playing C would have helped a bit better.];W[ro]LB[no:A][ro:B]
C[H: white should run into the center at A. Playing B does not give as many points, as A would take from black]
;B[qo];W[qp];B[rn];W[rp];B[no]C[H: Good defense];W[jd]LB[em:A]
C[A would have been another good move.  Extending whites territory lightly into the center]
;B[kd];W[bc];B[cf];W[bk];B[ck]LB[bj:A]C[H: This leaves blacks group open. Blocking at A would have been better.]
;W[bj];B[ch];W[ah]LB[bc:A][af:B]C[H: without blocking, there is nearly no point of territory, here for black. Note that white A can perform a monkey's jump to B.]
;B[bg];W[ep]LB[em:A]C[H: Again, A would have prevented black from sealign white in so easily.]

(;B[jj]LB[gf:D][jf:C][pi:B][jj:E][em:A][fm:F]TR[he][hf][if]
[ph][el][en][fn][fo]C[H: This is not a bad move, but still, I don't like it, because white cannot play there, as he is easily trapped in blacks territory.

If we have a look at potential white attacks into the center, we get the triangled points around A-D. 

E does not help with any of them.

I suppose that F is most valuable, here, as A is the most dangerous attack.

(F could come after some inducing moves, see variation)];W[fn]
LB[em:A]C[H: Good move. 
A is still another good possibility.];B[gn]
(;W[fm]LB[fm:A]C[I was expecting hane at G7. Would that have been better? I probably would have responded with H6, rather than starting a fight with F7.

H: I thik, A is better (see my vatiation to yours)];B[gm]C[H: Good moves on both sides in the following.]
;W[jf];B[gf];W[ge];B[hf];W[he];B[fl];W[el];B[fk]LB[ek:A]C[H: Defending at A would have been possible, too.]

(;B[qg]LB[rd:A][qg:B]C[H: A would have been the usual move, adn is better, here.

Even if black does not believe in killing white (and plays B to go for life), white must spend an additional move at teh corner group, so black can play B afterwards (but without teh weakness at A.]
