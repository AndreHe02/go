;AB[dd][dp][jj][pd][pp]C[klin: I will comment on white's move only.  (not very many anyway)]

;B[gc];W[fd];B[id];W[ee];B[gg];W[ef];B[fg];W[eg]C[klin: In an even game, I would not give up the two white stones H14 and H15.  White has played C17; therefore, the values of two black stones D14 and D16 are not large.]
;B[ig]C[I had quite an easy feeling now.];W[nc];B[nd];W[md]
;B[me];W[od];B[ne];W[oc];B[oe];W[pc];B[qd]TR[qc]C[I knew that the marked point was extremely large, but I  thought of it as too slow since it would have been gote and  black gets a perfect opportunity to invade my thin position on  the side.  Is this correct or do I have to play there anyway?]
;W[ni]C[klin: R17 is definitely too important to pass up.  The reason is after black plays at R17 white is in big trouble, see below.  If black invade right side, white has R14 and R3, no problem.]
;B[qc];W[ld]C[klin: Now if black plays at M18, white is in big trouble.]
;B[le];W[qb];B[rb];W[pa]C[klin: Now M18 is still valid.  Black M18, w N18, b P18.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[mn]TR[jo][dq]C[No I wasn´t able to decide whether to play boshi or tsuke, so  I tried to play both which is of course quite dubious.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[cq];B[cp];W[er];B[fq];W[jo]C[thats what I already told you.
I thought that if I live in gote in the corner, the black moyo  would become too big.
But I´ve been quite dissatisfied with my play here, maybe  can you tell me a better way to handle the bottom.]
;B[jm]C[klin: White 55 is OK in a 5-handicap game.  Otherwise would probably be killed by your opponent in an even game.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[hq];B[gq];W[kq]TR[br]C[the marked point puts the corner into a ko, doesn´t it ?]

C[klin: White 81 should be at A2 (bigger).];B[ol]TR[pk][qk]
C[I´ve already told my partner that this was quite bad.
I think he was able to invade deeply at one of the marked  points.
But that shows only the more that I played really bad at the  bottom, that he got such a thick wall to destroy my side  position; so once again, what went wrong?
Or is this kind of thin position unavoidable in a handi-game?]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[ql]C[klin: B could cut at R9, but it is not serious. (no more comment beyond this move)]
;B[ok]TR[qk]C[I thought of a cut at the marked position so this is bad  ajikeshi, isn´t it ?]
;W[pj]C[Now I have been sure that I´d win and in the end I won by 19  points, so I´ll show you only a few moves more.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[qf];B[pf];W[ej]C[(once again I played on two sides at the same time. this is  one of my weaknesses, that I can`t decide which is better.  How do you decide such things?)]
