C[This is a little slow.  I would full advantage of the san-ren-sei
opening and play k10.  This starts a large black moyo immediately.];W[pj]
;B[nc];W[qf];B[pc]C[I prefer Q18 to Q17.  It is lighter and W usually responds with R17.
If W plays somewhere else, B can take the UR corner later in the game.]
;W[qc];B[oc];W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[sc];B[jc]C[Once again, I'd consider K10.  O15 and G3 are also worth looking at.]
;W[fq]C[W gets this first.  But something around K10 looks good for W also.]
;B[er]C[This causes problems later.  D6 takes the side for B and leaves more
options for later.];W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[cj]C[The iron pillar is strong, but D7 plays better here.]
;W[em];B[dm]C[Now W can build a nice wall.  C7 instead of D7 closes out W without
letting him strengthen his outside wall.];W[dn];B[cn];W[en];B[bo]C[Connecting at C7 is better.  Then if W cuts at C7, B5 captures it in
a ladder.];W[dl];B[cm];W[el];B[cl]C[Wasted - you need to look at K10 or C17 at this point.

Protect the corner or set up a large center moyo.  K10 is not as good now,
though, because of the wall W just built.];W[cf]
(;B[cd]C[Here I'd play C15 and chase W out while taking territory.  See the
variation.];W[ch];B[bi]C[Too slow - attack W from the other side.  Other moves to consider.
F10 to keep W from connecting.  F16 to take to top edge and threaten E14.]
;W[eh];B[fj];W[gh];B[be]C[F16 better.];W[fc];B[ec];W[hc];B[ib];W[he];B[jf]
;W[jj]C[Now it's looking bad for B.  W leads and almost half the board.  B
will have to isolate and squash or kill the group in the UL.  Or
successfully invade W's moyo.  Both tasks are difficult.];B[jh]C[This does little for you.  J11 or H11 to cut W's large knight
linkage.  Then a lot of fighting to follow.];W[hi];B[gk]C[Once again, cut the link.  J10 or J11.]
;W[jl];B[hl];W[li]C[Now W and B trace out boundaries.  Problem is, W gets the best of
it.  B should not so docile.];B[lg];W[nh];B[nf];W[og];B[oe];W[pf];B[hn]
;W[io];B[in];W[jn];B[il];W[im];B[hm];W[jm];B[ej];W[go];B[pl]C[This is a very difficult invasion.  At this point W is over 50 pts
ahead.  Even if B succeeds and lives here - he'll still be behind.];W[qm]
C[Strong response - B has no where to go.];B[fr];W[gr];B[eq];W[fp];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[di];B[ag];W[cg];B[ki];W[kj];B[fb];W[gb];B[db];W[fa];B[eb]
;W[ga];B[ea];W[ed];B[cc];W[de];B[ce];W[ef];B[ci];W[fi];B[ei];W[dh];B[gj]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[ij];B[ik];W[ji];B[kh];W[mh];B[mg];W[fk];B[ho];W[hp];B[gn]
;W[fn];B[fl];W[ek];B[fm];W[ih];B[jg];W[if];B[je];W[id];B[ic];W[ie];B[hb]
;W[gc];B[ha];W[ig]C[B behind by 70 pts.  B needs to focus more on moyo development.
Don't let it get so unbalanced.])
(;B[ce];W[ef];B[fd]C[Now B has the UL corner and W has two weak stones to worry about.
Even if W invades at C17 - B gets most of the top edge.]))
