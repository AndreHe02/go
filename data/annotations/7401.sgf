C[Thank you for reviewing my game.

I'd like to know about my weaknesses, especially high-level strategic mistakes.   Tactical mistakes are usually pretty clear in hindsight but strategic errors really must be pointed out by a stronger player.



Hello, my name is Bernardo Reis and I'm from Brazil so please excuse my english mistakes.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[hp]
(;B[fp];W[dr]C[This seemed to be not in keeping with the 4th-line power strategy my first 2 moves claimed.  F3 was such a strange response to me, though...  Maybe D7 would have been better?


Nothing wrong with F3 but the hole sequence become strange.
Black is clearly afraid and White get too much territory];B[jp]
;W[eo]C[I wanted him to play more moves around that H4 stone, letting me strengthen myself while becoming overconcentrated.  I was hoping for F5.

W is playing ok.
B is so afraid that is giving free territory and influence and it all come from F4 mistake]
;B[go];W[qn]C[With white I always like to break black up before he makes a big framework.

It's ok take sente];B[qo];W[pn];B[mp];W[pj]C[When this sequence was played you have to think the question

"W can invade black territory?"

the best is think that before make the sequence];B[qh];W[op]
C[N4 looked a bit far to me, so I was trying to punish it.

Black is all 4 line and it gives him a lot of weakness.
W need to punish him.];B[oq];W[oo];B[qq]C[I got to play P4 and ended in sente, so I thought that was pretty decent punishment.

If you could invade would be better but considering the sequence was ok.]

(;W[iq]C[This was a strategic mistake and I was sorry for this later.  Should have just let it die, or maybe threaten to pull out for influence.

Any move where would be the last chance to invade black or try to reduce his territory.
The simple way is go to outside the territory.];B[jq];W[gr]

(;W[fo];B[gp];W[ir];B[jr];W[ip];B[jn];W[gq];B[gs];W[dj]C[Trying to salvage a bad situation

When you try to live and die.. you give even more territory and influence than just leave it alone.]
;B[fc]
(;W[fe]C[hoping for a large framework

when you want to make a Wall... just push and push and push]
;B[id];W[hm];B[in];W[gl]C[was this the right connection?

Was a Great move!
a lot of territory and influence];B[db];W[cc];B[cb];W[ri]C[settling shape and preparing for 3-3

Is not a good move until you finish the sequence and you left unfinished]
;B[rh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[kc]C[I was a little proud of this.

Too deep you can die.
L16 would be better];B[ke];W[ib]

(;B[lc]C[I think he really helped me here.


Yes, he helped you to make a living shape];W[lb];B[kd];W[jc]
;B[hb];W[ka];B[ch]C[This was the main fight of the game.

What is your analysis?  maybe I should have played B16 earlier instead of C17?  That fight would have been much tougher for him, but I would not have kept sente.


It all come because you left the group unstable I would try to keep the territory unstead of tryinh kill

the C17 move was ok but needed a move like C13 to finish the sequence]
