Thanks for the review in advance.
Ignore the ratings, KGS somehow elevated me from a 1k to 3d after not playing for a month. My previous opponents must have improved a lot.

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  My comments will be marked this way.]

(;W[pk];B[rp];W[ro];B[qq]C[[EV\] This move is safe but a bit slow.  I don't think it ever appears in professional games.  As W, I might be satisfied to respond at Q8, another safe but slow move, killing all the aji here.]

(;W[qi]C[[EV\] R9 is the normal move here (see variation).  This move is an interesting idea, trying to gain a liberty for the capturing race.  I did not read all the variations, but it seems to work.  Congratulations on a clever move.  This is the sort of extra effort you need to raise your game a level]

;B[fq];W[cn];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed]
(;W[db];B[eb]C[[EV\] Now B is trying for a little extra.  Early in the game, starting this sort of ko is too risky, as W captures first and neither side has large ko threats.  However, B now has several ko threats on the right side, so this does look playable.]
;W[ec];B[pi];W[pm];B[dc]
(;W[cb]C[[EV\] Connecting the other cut looks better (see variation).  B gets some nice forcing moves now.  It is not so large to let B to capture one stone in the corner, even apart from the unfinished ko.]
;B[de];W[cd];B[df];W[cg];B[lb];W[mg]C[[EV\] This move is a dame point, making no W territory and reducing no B territory.  While it is generally good to run into the center, here I think it would be better to live immediately with N18.  The situation would be different if there were any other weak groups in the vicinity.]
;B[kg];W[pe];B[qf];W[of];B[og];W[nf]C[[EV\] Now it is clear that the exchange N13-L13 helped B more than W.]
;B[eh]C[[EV\] This looks like a good place to pause and count.  Suppose W peacefully encloses the lower left corner and B peacefully keeps most of the moyo he has sketched out on top.  Then W has roughly 14 (upper left) + 6 (upper right) + 12 (right side) + 16 (lower left) = 48.  B has roughly 14 (lower right) + 10 (upper right) + 32 (top center) = 56.  My impression from following the play was that W had fallen a little behind, but maybe not.]

(;W[hq];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr]
(;W[dr]C[[EV\] This is not a standard continuation.  Even though the ladder is good, b should be able to make sabaki easily.  See the other variations.]
;B[eq];W[br];B[cp];W[bq];B[do];W[ep];B[hp];W[ip];B[gp];W[co]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr]C[[EV\] This move is a common mistake which loses sente.  Just connect solidly at K4.  B still has to capture with H2 (although he can exchange K2-L2 first if he wants), so W gets to extend into the center for safety or just play elsewhere, treating these stones lightly.  This mistake was the beginning of W problems.]
;B[hr];W[io];B[kp];W[jp];B[ko];W[im];B[ik]C[[EV\] Nice play by B.  If W just runs away on dame now, while B gets useful moves, W will fall behind.  W needs to develop some counterplay.  Maybe play M3 and see what develops?  The two B stones at L4 are not very strong.]
;W[gn];B[eo];W[bp];B[fo]
(;W[fm]C[[EV\] Too easy on B, inviting him to march through W territory.  E7 is necessary, then fight if B cuts.  W has no need to fear this fight -- a few possible variations are shown.  I think this can safely be called the losing move.]
;B[em];W[el];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm];W[cl];B[bm];W[fl]C[[EV\] This is much too big a loss.  B now has roughly the same territory as W in this corner, a loss of 16 points from our previous count.  B did a nice job of wrapping up the game uneventfully from here.  No further comments.]

;B[dr];W[ep];B[er]C[[EV\] W can continue from here with F4 (emphasizing the center) or B3 (taking corner territory).]
))
(;W[ih]C[Is this the right time to play here, instead of attacking the black stone below?

[EV\] It is a close call -- both plans seem possible.  B does not have a large moyo here, and he does not have prospects for enlarging it greatly if W plays elsewhere, so reducing it is not urgent.  On the other hand, W probably can reduce modestly in sente, gaining some center strength in the process.  Your proposed move looks good, or it could be a space or two to the left.  I would not go in deeper.  Another idea would be to take the ko sometime soon, to see which way B defends.]

(;W[cd];B[cb];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[ef];W[de];B[ge];W[fg]C[[EV\] Not a definitive sequence, but this direction of play looks better for W than the game continuation.  W can take the ko between moves, making B use up ko threats.  Soon B will need to win the ko, so W gets another move on the outside.]
))
(;W[de]C[Knowing that he would be able to win the ko, should I have played here instead?

[EV\] No, your play was fine, but see later comment.  In this line, B still has C18, leading to the same ko, and C14 becomes an inefficient stone.  If you really want to avoid ko, just connect solidly at C16.]

(;W[rp]C[Is this bad? I recall something about not playing here, but I couldn't remember the reason or the context.

[EV\] If B responds at R3, the exchange would be fine for W, but what if B ignores the corner?  A move like Q9 would reverse the attack/defense situation on the side.  Taking the corner would not be compensation enough for this reversal -- B still has room for a safe extension to L3 after W takes R3.]
