RE[B+10.5]

C[Hello. Thank you for reviewing this game.
This is a game a played some time ago on DGS server. This game has enough questinable moves. I marked most of them. Sometimes I just don't see good alternatives.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cq]C[I am experimenting with hoshi and san-san combination lately.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq]C[Should I have played somewhere else? Like R14.]
;B[kp];W[nc]C[Don't sure whether it's good direction.

I don't see any problem with this.  An approach from the other side (around R14) would probably be the wrong direction, but this looks okay to me.]
;B[qf];W[kd];B[pb];W[fc];B[ep];W[dg]C[This feels awkward because it leaves white's stone's at F17, D13, and C3 all isolated.  Black's next several moves are aimed at splitting those stones.  B ends up with several moyos and w has a weak wall in the center -- a good outcome for black.]
;B[ce]C[My next move doesn't seem good to me. I mean position occured after B C5.]
;W[cj]C[Yes, this move doesn't help you much.  The stone at D13 is still unsettled, and now you're committing to defend it.  This will probably lead to some heavy shapes for white.]
;B[co];W[dq];B[fq];W[er];B[fr]C[B's southern moyo is now very strong.]
;W[bp];B[bm];W[dm]C[Should this one be at E10? Now I see that this move achieved nothing for me.
I ended up with a weak group here.

E10 and B13 both look like good shape.  B13 is nice because it puts pressure on black's stones at D16 and almost settles w's group at the same time.  D7 doesn't look terrible, though.  If you're willing to sacrifice D13 or D7, this could be good light play.]
;B[bg];W[ff]C[This feels mistimed.  W is strong enough to live on the left already.]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[gf];W[he]C[Here, G16 would put more pressure on the cutting stone (F15).]
;B[gg];W[ej]C[Interesting move -- basically, you're betting that F14 already has enough support to survive.]
;B[gi];W[ee]C[Better from the other side?

E14 would have been better.  E15 is only useful if it allows you to kill the cutting stone and connect your groups.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[eg];W[eh];B[df];W[fh];B[fg]C[Ouch.  White has settled the top, but the stones around D11 are still threatened.  B has one strong, connected group.]
;W[gh];B[dh];W[di];B[ch];W[hh]C[Better at where B played next?

This is a good move.  It feels more urgent than R9/R10 to me.]
;B[qk];W[nf];B[nn];W[qi]C[Overplay, I think.];B[ok];W[ni];B[oi]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[qr];B[oq];W[gm]C[I like this move.  It uses D7, H12, and O11 very well.]
;B[hp];W[og]C[Good.  This makes your stones much thicker here.]
;B[pi];W[rl]C[I ended this one in gote. Is it better to reduce center at this point?

The center looks bigger to me at this point.  You have a lot of thickness to use there.]
;B[rk];W[ql];B[pl];W[qm];B[kk];W[ki];B[im];W[jl]C[Judging by the balance of score I felt that I need to put up a fight.
Would you show me how should it have been played better?

The decision to fight sounds good to me.  I'm not sure why you chose to start with this move.  This is a splitting move to keep L9 and J7 apart, but both of those stones can easily connect back to groups on the outside.  It's late at this point, but here are some other options: N9 threatens an invasion; H9 is submissive, but claims territory behind your G12 wall; D5 threatens to capture the whole left side of the board.  I think the most promising sequence would be one leading up to D5 soon.  That's a fight you can win, or at least make gains from fighting.]

;B[dl];W[cl];B[cm];W[el];B[ck];W[il];B[in];W[fk]C[Wasted move. What is the biggest point now?

D6, or something around O6, I think.  F1, T9, C19, and Q13 are also starting to look attractive.]

(;W[lk]C[Is this variation better? It lead to complicated fighting, but it might be what I actually need sicne I am behind at this point of the game.

I think M9 works.  You'd have to watch the liberties of the farmer's hat at K8 carefully.]

(;W[fl]C[Better?

Neither of these moves will stop w's invasion.  I like F8 a little better because it could support D5 later.]
