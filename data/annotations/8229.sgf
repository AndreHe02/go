C[Game played on Jan 27, 2011.

No komi.

I played Black, and lost by 2 points.  I believe I may have been winning, but actually threw away the game through a reading mistake in the endgame:  I should have filled in a ko much earlier than I did and I would have avoided the loss of a small group, which swung the game in my opponent's favor.  However, I feel I could have done much better in the earlier stages of the game as well.

I would appreciate it if you could also offer some comments on skills or techniques to improve upon in addition to the moves in the game.

Thanks!

Hi, I'm Gus, and in reviewing this game, I think you did fairly well, but you need to be careful about letting your opponent settle first, and you need to be less jealous of your opponent's territory. You had almost enough points to win this game, and so I'd say you lost this game at least 5 times. 

The first was when you let w settle. if white remained weak, you would probably get more points
The second was when you tried an unreasonable invasion and gave w extra stones on the outside
The third was your over cautious defense at f2. You passed. 
And the last was when you were insufficiently nervous about a large number of cutting points and failed to respond to r9.

There is no one aspect of your game that stands out as worse than the others, so the best thing to do is problems. Lots of problems. Easy problems that take you less than a minute. It's amazing how effective it is to get so good at the easy problems that you never ever get them wrong in the game (such as your pass move at f2) beating your brains out with hard problems is recreation. Doing lots of easy problems is study :).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]C[I played this approach high to work with the stone at Q16.  My opponent had other plans, though.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[ec];B[ch];W[pj]C[I felt that I didn't need to respond to this move.  What do you think?]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[ck];B[cq]C[I was expecting White to play the joseki and move here, in which case I would have played J3.  Is this result better for White?]

(;B[pf]LB[qf:A][qg:D][qh:C][pj:B]TR[kc][lc][jd][kd]C[I realize that White's intention in playing here is to develop the upper side.  I considered plays at the marked points.  However, I felt a pincer was risky and could potentially leave me with two weak groups.  On the other hand, if I don't do anything now, White's moyo could cause me trouble (as it did later on).

Gus: I tend to prefer A when B is already in place. Your play makes C a nearly sente move for white. One might also consdier playing at D]
;W[qh]
(;B[og]C[I somehow remember that a move at R13 contravenes the spirit of the moves at Q16 and Q14.  So I step out into the center.

Gus: R13 is bad because it strengthen's white and leaves you with a weakness. See variation]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[jd]LB[lc:A]C[But now W has a nice big moyo on the upper side.  If I attack now, I am worried that I will end up with weak groups.  I had considered a move at A but I decided to try attack the right side instead.]
;B[ql]C[Gus: This is ok. White's top is big, ut you have good prospects with this attack. Your proposed invasion is very risky and would likely damage your outside stones. Reducing the top side is probably a better strategy.

Variations here are some reductions to think about]

Gus: This is why it matters if you let white settle. You made 20 points, but you have an eyeless group which is worth at least -20 points. In this case w is also making a few points so this is a loosing trade for you. You don't have to readfar to know this. Look at where the black stones are relative to your walll.]
