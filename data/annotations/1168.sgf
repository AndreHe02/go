C[Hi!

I apologize in advance
for telling too much what is  not good  and not telling  the good I can't see.

Jean as a reviewer];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[cn];W[bp]LB[co:A]
[dn:B][fq:C][cp:D][cq:E]C[As far as I know
this move is not standard joseki.
A, B, C are more likely.

Actually it is too weak to defend the corner and does not attack the black stone.

If white is a weaker player as black and want to secure the  corner, he can play D or E.]
;B[dk];W[bf]LB[df:A][ch:B]C[Too close from the side.

It is almost impossible to live and escape could be difficult.

A or B are strong black replies];B[bh]C[Too low either];W[ch]
C[next sequence ok];B[ci];W[cg];B[ce]LB[de:A][df:B]C[Too slow.
A or B better];W[eg];B[fc]LB[fe:A]C[black could continue to chase white weak group with A for example.

Now A is a good point for white];W[mc]LB[jd:A]C[White forget the left group.
He should at least play
A (K16) or something high to help it.];B[kc]LB[jc:A]C[Black too close
A better];W[pb];B[qc]C[OK];W[me]LB[ic:A]C[That is the second time that white  makes black position stronger and itself weaker.

ie, white make weak group wihout enough base to live on the side and does not attack black but reinforce him.

White should here attack the black stone L17 with A for example or playing contact.]
;B[pg]C[good];W[qi];B[rh]LB[qh:A]C[A (R12) should be stronger]
;W[pe]C[OK for white];B[qe];W[oe];B[pf]LB[qf:A][nd:B]C[A stronger

B interesting];W[qb]C[good];B[rb]C[black maybe a little too weak around to play this standard answer]
;W[ra];B[rd]LB[rc:A]C[I prefer A (S17)];W[sb];B[rc];W[ri];B[qh]
C[To defensive

White is good and has easy sente];W[mi]C[The Idea is good, thinking to the weak group to link

Black has more secure areas

White has more big moyos and center influence];B[oq]C[obviously, big space to take on the left side]
;W[qr]LB[op:A]C[weak move

"A" much better here with the white stones above

White should let black take the corner or live on the side and take influence toward the center with easy territory on the right side]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[kq]C[OK];W[hq]LB[fq:A]C[OK

black standard attack at F3];B[fq];W[fp];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep]LB[gp:A]
C[black should not try to live or kill white group but instead connect to its other group, squizing white group with A for ex]
;W[eo];B[fo]LB[gp:A][gq:B]C[A (G4) better for black, then B (G3)]
;W[eq];B[gp]C[Black did too much contact all along this sequence]
;W[ep]
(;B[hp]LB[gq:A]C[G3 better (see prev var)];W[gq]C[good

now white better then black];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[fm]
(;B[ip]LB[en:A]C[Black should have ciut at "A"];W[dn]C[good]
;B[dm];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[ln]LB[mn:A]C[white good

black much too passive

A good point for black];B[co]C[too slow

not enough threat

loose sente];W[ic]C[good];B[je];W[kd];B[jd];W[jc]
(;B[ke];W[ld];B[nd]LB[od:A][oc:B]C[nice spot

A or B less risky and effective to split white in two];W[od]
;B[oc]C[too late];W[pc];B[ne];W[qd];B[of]C[ok squeeze];W[pd]
;B[ob]LB[rf:A]C[ok black should have play A or something to protect his group]
;W[re]C[The game ends here

I played for the fun and white take the black group but there is a lot to do before quiting the game as far as I'm concerned!]
