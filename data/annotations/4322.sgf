C[kilroy [10k\]: hi
Garzahd [10k\]: hello



Hi kilroy,

You basically were winning throughout this game but you almost threw it away with the ko fight at the top.

The game appeared close before you won on time.  I have highlighted most of the major mistakes in this game.

It was a pleasure to review your game,

;W[kd];B[oc]C[is this still joseki, and how do i respond to this move?

N: Yes, see variation.];W[nb]

N: B should play at A.];W[rp]
(;B[rr];W[rk];B[mo];W[lp];B[qn];W[rn];B[ql];W[rl];B[pm];W[rm]
C[this invasion, was it worth it or could something better have been done

N: You got a very good result with the invasion as you destroyed much of B's main territory.  B's attack of this group was not effective.]
;B[ri];W[qo];B[pn];W[rq];B[qr]C[N: too small....];W[kn]C[N:...and W gets sente.

At this early stage, I'd say W is already winning and should win the game.]
;B[fq]
(;W[hp]C[N: Wrong direction - W is pretty strong on this side so it is better to play at D3 or E3 or D6.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hr];W[ir];B[em]
(;W[dm];B[hn]C[how can i counter attack his group

N: This group is not easy to attack or kill.  The idea is to try and make territory along the side while threatening it.]
;W[go]LB[ce:A]C[N: Too direct

I'd play in the upper left first, then wait to see how B responds as you may be able to generate an attack on the lower B group.  The W stones on the bottom have pretty good shape so you shouldn't have too much trouble defending them.]
;B[gn];W[fp];B[ep];W[fn];B[gp];W[ho];B[en];W[hq];B[gr];W[kl]
C[N: Too small.  B got a good result by settling his group, even though in gote.

W C15 or D15 is better];B[de];W[ee];B[dd];W[ed];B[cc];W[ec]
;B[ef]C[N: Overplay];W[df]C[N:Good cut];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh]

N: D14 was good was a good cut.]
(;W[he]LB[ch:A]TR[dc][ec][ed][ee]C[N:I'd play at C12 first.  B will not have an easy time trying to attack the marked W stones.]

kilroy [9k\]: thanks

Garzahd [10k\]: I saw it at 10 moves left
Garzahd [10k\]: thought I had used enough
kilroy [9k\]: well truethfully that's when i last looked at it too
kilroy [9k\]: well thank you again
Garzahd [10k\]: yeah thanks

I win on time, but i wish to know my overplays, and general tips to help my game.


N: This ko is huge and whoever wins it, I believe will win the game.]
