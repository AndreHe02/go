;W[pp];B[fc];W[dp];B[cj]LB[pc:A][dd:B]TR[fc]C[sita: I would suggest 'A' instead or something around that point. The direction of this shimari fits good with the marked stone. If w invades thereafter at 'B' you can press him down and build a nice moyo.]

(;B[ic]LB[pc:A]C[sita: This move seems to be a bit jealous, you don't want to grant your opponent any territory. But unfortunately it is gote and thus it is quite small. Still 'A' would be bigger. See var.]

C[sita: In my oppinion your biggest problem is that you focus too much on the territory your opponend builds and do not see your own potential. For example move #13 or #31. Your play would improve a lot when you try to balance moves against your opponents positions and moves that develop your own positions. A good example of such a move is #37, which improves your position greatly.]
