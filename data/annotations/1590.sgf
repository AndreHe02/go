(;B[cn]CR[cn];W[dk]CR[dk];B[cj]CR[cj]LB[en:A]C[J: This felt wrong. The idea was to make the top group a bit stronger and leave the stone below to its various options. I think it could have been better.

;W[hn]CR[hn]LB[jl:A][in:B]C[** Should be at (a). Black can break through now with (b) etc.]

CR[pj]C[** Good.];W[pl]CR[pl]TR[ko]LB[om:A][ol:B][nm:C]C[** A key question is what happens to the black cutting stone.
If it is rescued, the white four-stone group below may become
weak. I agree that running with it straightaway is not likely
to give a good result.

Instead you should try to steer the fight on the right so that you
get some backup. A simple idea (maybe the best) could be to go
for (a), hoping, for example, for (b)-(c).];B[qk]CR[qk]LB[oo:A]
[pn:B][om:C][oc:D][nc:E]C[** A bit negative. Notice also that the corner is becoming isolated.]
;W[pn]CR[pn];B[oc]CR[oc]LB[po:A][nn:B][nc:C][mc:D][qf:E]C[** Seems worthwhile to push at least once at (a) first. At
the top, (c) would eliminate white's extension to (d), but
make the invasion on the right easier.];W[pg]CR[pg];B[nj]CR[nj]
;W[qn]CR[qn];B[ng]CR[ng]C[** The corner at the bottom is in a sorry state, but should
be alive.];W[oi]CR[oi];B[oj]CR[oj];W[ni]CR[ni]LB[mh:A]C[** Heavy - white has to play elsewhere first, and will
probably come out at (a) when he returns here.];B[mi]CR[mi]
;W[pd]CR[pd];B[pc]CR[pc];W[nf]CR[nf];B[ph]CR[ph]LB[mf:A]C[J: I felt the need to capture to get some eyes early. I suspect there is a better attack on a broader scale.

;W[ql]CR[ql];B[jd]CR[jd]LB[df:A][ic:B]C[J: At this point I felt white had the chance to attack my left group and build centre territory.  I had to choose between solidifying on the left with something like E14 or doing something to stop White getting  the centre. I think I made the wrong choice - what are your thoughts?

** The black group is safe, but it's true that white can build some
thickness, pressing at (a), for example.

A main question is: what's the score? If white can win by playing
simply (b), black has to come up with an invasion. In this position,
black should have a good game though, so just play it safe.]
