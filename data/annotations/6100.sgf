;B[pd]C[ I tend to get myself into trouble within the first thirty moves of a
game, so I am especially interested in the opening. I ended up winning this one but I think it was only because my opponent became overly aggressive and made a few reading mistakes.

edgy:  That's a pretty fair summary.  You played very well overall, as far as I can see.  There was one major mistake I saw in the direction of play, at 22 when White dove into the corner instead of moving out into the  center.  That gave Black a lead until 47/49, when he made the same mistake.  White's 78 put Black right back in the game, but he apparantly thought he was still behind, and went crazy starting around 87.  White wrapped it up nicely.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[qn]LB[qi:A]TR[pd]C[I wanted to make a sente move on the right side to keep Black from getting too big but I really only ended up making him very strong. Should I have aimed at a side extension instead?

edgy: Black would like to make an extension from teh marked stone, making a double-wing formation.  This approach helps him do that.  Maybe a splitting move around 'A' would be better.  On the other hand, strongplayers have played your move here.]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp]LB[pq:A]C[edgy:  Pushing at 'A' first is more normal, I think.]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[pq];B[op];W[nq];B[pn]LB[mo:A]C[edgy:  This strikes me as a little tight.  'A' seems better for building a moyo.]
;W[qf]LB[np:A]C[Even worse
edgy:   'A' is an idea.  But White's actual move doesn't seem too bad. If White can make a position inside Black's area, that would be very good.]
;B[qh]
(;W[qc]LB[of:B][ph:A]C[edgy:  I think this is wrong.  It lets Black make the right side solid territory, and he can expand into the center.  'A' or 'B' look better.  (See the variations)]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[od];W[nc];B[nd];W[jj]
LB[mc:A]C[Is 32 reasonable? I wanted to reduce his strength on the right side as soon as possible.

edgy:  I suppose it's reasonable, though it gives away much of teh benefit of having dived into the corner.  'A', taking more profit, was worth considering, although I can see why White was worried about the scope of the Black moyo.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa];B[mc];W[mo]LB[pi:B][mj:A]C[Again, trying to reduce his right side but I imagine there's a much more efficient method...

edgy:  'A'  comes  to mind, continuing with the plan of reducing Black's moyo.  'B' is also interesting for that.  But I think White's move is OK..]
;B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp]LB[pi:B][mj:A][lq:C]C[edgy: This doesn't look good to me.  If white's going to play on teh lower side, 'C' is more solid.  But again, a reducing move like 'A'  or 'B' seems logical.]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[fq]LB[lj:A]C[edgy:  This looks bad to me.  A move around 'A' would make Black's moyo very big.  It's not like White has an easy way to consolidate territory yet.]

(;W[hq]LB[fp:A]C[I thought pincering at 48 would help strengthen my 32 stone.

edgy:  That's an idea.  I wonder if attaching at 'A' and building up your own central influence might be a good didea.]
;B[cq]LB[fo:A][hp:B]C[edgy:  I don't like this at all.  Now White gets a nice moyo of his own.  Jumping with 'A' or  attaching with 'B' makes more sense.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[bn]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[jl]LB[lj:B][ll:A][lo:C]C[Too early?

edgy:  It's hard to judge, but I think that  'A" or  'B' would do a better job of expanding Black's moyo while limiting White's ('A' could give White trouble with the  cut at 'C" later).  Black's game would be much easier if he hadn't given White that big wall on the left.]
;W[lk]TR[jl]C[Is this a reasonable response or too severe?

edgy:  I like it.  It makes Black worry about the marked stone, and threatens a deeper incursion into Black's moyo.]
;B[lr];W[nr];B[lo]
(;W[kn]LB[mn:A][mr:B]TR[nr]C[edgy:  Can White get away with 'A' here?  Probably not.]

;W[gp];B[fp];W[fo];B[dn];W[eo];B[em]LB[fe:A][jh:B]C[85 seems a bit too over ambitious.

edgy:  Yes.   'A' or 'B', expanding Black's area and limiting White's, would  be better.]
;W[ek];B[gm]C[Black seems to be playing to stir up trouble, which would make more sense if he were behind.  But he's not-- Black's incursion into teh lower side has given him the lead again, and he shouldjust play to expand/consolidate his moyo as in the last note]
;W[en];B[dm];W[fm];B[fl];W[el];B[fn];W[dl];B[fm];W[go];B[hk]
;W[fe]C[edgy:  Good move!  This point is huge for increasing White's left-side territory and limiting Black's central and upper-side potential.]
;B[db];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hi]C[edgy: While Black is trying to make this group live, White can either  consolidate a lot of territory on the left or build influence against Black's right-side moyo. Also, Black is still thin in the upper left.]
;W[jh]LB[fi:A]C[edgy:  This is good.  White could also play  'A' to make left-side territory  Black could play at W104, but his group would still not be safe yet, and White could still push it around from the  right.]
;B[ei]LB[fj:A]C[edgy:  'A' looks like better eye-shape.];W[fk]
;B[gk];W[ci];B[cj]LB[fj:A]C[edgy:  This looks like a huge overplay.  'A'  is a lot safer.]

;W[fh];B[ej];W[ck]C[edgy:  Black has ruined teh White left-side territory...except that his group can't live.]

;W[ig];B[ih];W[ji];B[bd];W[ce]LB[cc:C][kf:A][ah:B]C["A" and "B" miai?

edgy:  Fore connecting the White top-left group out, yes.  But White could probably live with 'C' as well-- the thinness of Black's own top-left group would come into play.  And of course, as long as teh White group lives, Black's group is simply dead.]
;B[cc];W[ah]LB[kf:A]C[edgy:  A minor quibble:   Since 'A' is also available, This move wasn'rt necessary.  If White was going to take one of the miai now, I'd choose 'A', which has an effect on Blackk's right-side area.  But in any case, the big Black groupo on the right is dead, so White is winning.]
;B[ag];W[ai];B[bg];W[af];B[hj];W[dh];C[Result: W+Resign

edgy:  This was a see-saw battel until Black went nuts starting around 87.  White played very well to wrap it up.]

;W[dm]C[edgy:  something like this, perhaps.  Teh idea is similar to what Whote gets in teh game, but in teh gaem Black didn't have to oblige by diving into the corner.]
))
(;W[ph];B[qi];W[of];B[nd];W[rd]C[edgy:  White gets some space in teh corner, and has his head in teh center.  Black's right-side moyo is a little flattened now.  This should be OK for White.]
)
(;W[of];B[nd];W[rd]LB[qc:B][oh:A][pi:C]C[edgy:  If Black plays 'A', White goes into teh corner at 'B'.  If Black defends the corner with 'B', White can play 'A' or 'B'.  In any case, like teh other variation, White's OK (Black's OK, too).]
