C[DW: Thanks for review. My main problem in this game was how to reduce blacks large mojo in the lower left corner or how and when to hinder the building of that mojo. If b had not made two main errors in the game I would have lost quite utterly.

Hi, this is Andre. I mark my comments with AB.];B[dd];W[pp]
;B[dq];W[pc];B[ck];W[jd];B[qe]
(;W[pe]C[No good, or?

AB: Completely ok. This would be a question for 3 dan and up.]
;B[qd];W[pd];B[qc];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[md]LB[qh:a]C[Too cramped?

AB: Yes. This is the first serious mistake. Must be at R12.]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc]LB[jf:a][fc:b][qh:c]TR[md]C[AB: Now you see even more that N16 is bad. Imagine it was not there and you could put it anywhere you want. You would choose A or B or still R12, which is still the most important.]
;B[qh]C[AB: Big.];W[ph]
(;B[qi]C[AB: White should even double-hane at Q11 (see variation).]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[mh]C[AB: Again a little bit in the middle of nowhere. Could be better at F17, for example.]
;B[oj]
(;W[oi]LB[ni:a]C[AB: Ah! Do you sometimes hear stronger players talk about shape and how stones work together and such stuff? Well, this is a prime example of bad shape. Really a terrible move, which you will see in a second. But you can learn from it very effectively. This shape is called the empty triangle and should be avoided. Here, O11 instead would have been much better.]
;B[ni];W[oh]LB[og:a]C[AB: The problems start, and the shape doesn't get any better. Better at P13.]

(;B[nj]C[AB: Black is nice. See variations for the real terror :-).]
;W[nh];B[qo]C[AB: Also very unusual. R6 would be normal.]
(;W[qp]TR[qo]C[AB: Just the exchange of the two marked stones seems to favor White, no? White solidifies the corner and Black does not gain all that much here.]
;B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[no]C[AB: Probably the double-hane at O6 is possible.]
;B[nn]C[Perhaps I should have left the situation as it is in the bottom right corner and played something like D5?]
;W[mo]C[AB: No, this is good.];B[do]TR[md]C[AB: It's true that Black is ahead. But this is just because of the upper right. The N16 stone now is completely useless, if you had that stone somewhere on the lower side (J3 for example), the game would be even.]
;W[kq]C[ wanted some secure territory but invited a move like black played

AB: Yes, this is too narrow, you could have gone to J3. If Black invades you can still play F3 and have a J3-F3 base, no problem.]
;B[hq]C[Now I did not know how to reduce the large mojo of black in the lowe right corner

AB: Yes, Black is now clearly ahead. L3 was too close.];W[cf]
C[AB: Good.];B[df];W[ce]LB[dg:a]C[AB: D13 would be normal.]
;B[de];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[ch];B[bb];W[bd]C[AB: A little slow. D13 is better I think.]
;B[hd]
(;W[ib]C[AB: I think I recognize the two main problems in your game now. You are playing to safely, which is why you end up with too few points. First, you always answer your opponent's move. That's not good, your first instinct should be exactly the opposite: Can I ignore my opponent's move and play something I like? Second, it's those overconcentrated shapes, N16 and L3. Basically, you invest too many stones for too few points. Here you should take the initiative. In the lower left I think something like D6 seems possible. Also, Black's shape in the lower right is not optimal (see variations).]
;B[hb];W[ic];B[hc];W[jg]C[AB: Not bad, but not big enough given that you are behind.]
;B[kj];W[ro]LB[pn:a]C[AB: As shown before I think you can cut at Q6.]
;B[rn];W[rp];B[rm]LB[dn:a]C[Still chances to invade b`lacks mojo in the lower right corner?

AB: Yes, I think the variation with D6 is still possible. Anyways, if you die you lose, if you don't try you lose as well.]
;W[bj];B[cj];W[bk];B[bl];W[ci];B[di]LB[dl:a]C[AB: Weak. Must protect the cut, D8 for example.]

(;W[ip]C[My way to reduce blacks mojo gently

AB: I think you can cut at C8. It's big (see variation).];B[hp]
;W[io];B[lp]LB[dl:a][if:b][gn:c]C[AB: Complete overplay. Black should just play solidly.]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[jq];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[ln];W[km];B[lm]
;W[jm];B[in];W[im];B[hn];W[mq]LB[ho:a][go:b]C[AB: I think playing H5 is good. It creates some weaknesses in Black's shape. Then Black G5, then come back to N3. You should still have enough liberties that way.]
;B[ho]C[I had no idea what to do next

AB: Now Black is solid.]
(;W[hm]C[AB: If you are afraid to cut at C8 you can certainly play B7, which is also big (see variation).]
;B[gm];W[gl]C[Bad move I guess it helped black to extend his mojo

AB: Yes, your shortage of liberties is a problem here.];B[hl]

;W[dh];B[ei];W[ir];B[hr];W[hs];B[iq];W[jr];B[gs];W[is];B[gr]
;W[ki];B[jl]C[AB: Bad. White cannot play there himself, so Black reduces his own liberties and wastes a ko threat.]
;W[ko];B[li];W[lh];B[lj];W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[gb];W[al]C[AB: B7 is the move as seen before.]
;B[am]C[I needed errors of black like this otherwise I would have lost uttely, but why?

AB: Yes, bad mistake of Black here.];W[bm];B[ak];W[cl];B[bi]
;W[al];B[kh];W[aj]LB[an:a]C[AB: Could you not take A6 right away?]

[pr][ps][qq][qr][qs][rq][rr][rs][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[AB: To sum it up, you should see that go is not just about surrounding a little territory, but in the end about the efficient use of ones stones. You should probably take more initiatives during the game and avoid bad and overconcentrated shapes. Black was in some way the opposite of you: speedy development, but left a lot of weaknesses behind. In the end you could expose them and won, which is the fair result of this game, because Black was overdoing things at some points. Still, I think if you want to learn only one thing from this game it is to avoid moves like N16 and L3, which were way too close to your strength. Hope this helped a bit, good luck!]
