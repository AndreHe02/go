C[Hi,

My reviews are a little blunt but I try to give you advice straight so you can improve.  Your basics need work, especially in the area of direction, i.e. playing the important strategic moves.  If you have "Lessons in the fundamentals of Go" reread it, if not, get it and then read it twice :)  To make it to one dan you need to rework your thinking centering solely on proper usage of the basics.  That means both in reading and in global strategy.

At some parts of this game the reading required goes above my level.  I give variations and my explanations but keep in mind I am only 2d and mortal.

Btw this game was very VERY interesting in terms of reading out variations :)]

;B[qo]C[Black takes a second shimari in sente.];W[qh]
(;B[jp]LB[qf:A][qm:B]C[This is not the correct strategy for this board.  It could be playable, but definitely not the best out of all possible strategies.  K4 is a moyo move but white is strong on the right (he has miai extensions at A and B so you cannot weaken him).  If you tried to construct a moyo....]

;W[gn]C[Nice point.];B[ri];W[qi]C[I had to think awhile on this one :)  Because white neglected J2 you have a chance in this game.  If black's bottom group were weaker you would not.  Your strategy at this point is to attack r10 to make center influence facing whites moyo so you can erase it.]

;W[kr];B[lq];W[js];B[ir];W[kq]C[But now the idea is, how to attack these two groups?  First off l3 is like almost a strong group so its harder to attack.  Second, the border between the black and white moyos is at the top.  You want to use this attack to gain control of that border.]
