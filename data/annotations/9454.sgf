;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[ec];B[qj];W[cd];B[jq];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]
;B[qf];W[pb]C[krv: looks like L16 is bit more important right now]
;B[ic]C[Was planning on taking this point myself after B defended at R17]
;W[qc]C[Since B took J17 I went ahead and took the corner with R17]
;B[fd];W[ed]C[krv: R3 or O3 is bit more important. Locally F17 is more accurate.]
;B[cn];W[ck]C[Attacked here with the pincer due to the presence of my strong corner in the upper left, right or wrong judgement?

krv: You are right. D9 looks bit better];B[en];W[gq]C[When I reviewed the game myself I thought this might have been too loose and should have been played at F3, thoughts?

krv: yes, usual D4-G3 formation is bit loose with presence of C6]
;B[bp]C[krv:: you are lucky];W[cq];B[ch];W[ek];B[de];W[ee];B[dd]
C[krv: D14 looks like tesuji];W[dc];B[ce];W[bd]C[krv: D14 or D13 instead]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[eh];W[bq]C[krv: Small yose. G9 is important now]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[hq]C[krv: Usual with no obvious gain/loss when you can't count to the end 4-th line is better than 3-rd.]
;B[hp];W[gk];B[fl];W[fk];B[gh];W[cm]C[krv: looks useless. Usual better build eyes when center is more determined. May be it will be useless or you will survive by connecting to upper right (H11 serves this plan)]
;B[bn];W[ik];B[ng];W[jn]C[This was my worst move of the game in my opinion.  In fact I feel like it almost lost me the game.  I thought a better move might be at H12 or just L9.  My idea was here to defend my weak group by threatening to hane and cure at J4.  On review I decided my stones above were too weak to even think about cutting and I should have just defended.  Would appreciate your thoughts on this move.

krv: J4 is good right now. But your move isn't so bad - it creates some living potential and thus game is almost even.]
;B[hl];W[hk]C[krv: G8 looks better. If B defends with H7 you continue with H7 and black form looks vulnerable]
;B[il];W[jl];B[jk];W[eq]C[krv: looks like game move. Missclick?]
;B[jo];W[qq]C[Felt I had to enter here as if B played Q3 or such then the game would be beyond reach.

krv: R3 looks desperate. Most continuations create a strong wall and J9 dies. Should breakout to center instead.]
;B[kk];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi]C[krv: K12 instead looks stronger. Now black K12 encloses your group and while you will make life black will make profit.]
;B[hh];W[ji];B[kg];W[dm];B[dn];W[bm]C[krv: This way you are deeply behind. M11 keeps more chances. Another good way is G8 - you create aji and then leave center group as it is (hope it lives) and continue with R3.]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[li];W[jj];B[fc];W[qp]C[krv: L5 first is stronger.]
;B[pq];W[po];B[oo];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl]C[krv: Q9 instead]
;B[nk];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[ql];W[qm];B[rj];W[iq];B[jp];W[pr]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[od];B[mb];W[pc];B[fb];W[eb]
;B[be];W[ef]C[This was when I got excited and started playing too fast, couldnt read out the life or death in the corner, immediately thought I should have defended at B18, but still felt like I was behind in the game, and needed to reduce the center.]
;B[bc];W[cc];B[bb];W[ad];B[ea];W[da];B[cb];W[fa];B[gb];W[dg]
;B[dh]C[krv: Now you have a chances again. Black have played last 10 moves very dubious.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[eg];W[ae];B[ff];W[or]C[krv: O3 is better. 3rd line is better than 2nd almost always.]
;B[nq];W[nr]C[krv: crawling around 2nd line is a bit small.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[jr];W[ir];B[lq];W[qd];B[re];W[pe];B[mf];W[og]
;B[oh];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[pi];W[nf];B[nh];W[ga];B[hb];W[me]
;B[lf];W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[ke];W[gl]C[krv: At least you got this first]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[gn];W[em]C[krv: F6 instead hurts black];B[fn]
C[I felt like here I had gotten the game reasonably close, with B ahead by maybe 5 to 10 points on the board.  Hows my counting and positional judgement?  Felt I could win if I made strong endgame moves.

krv: Now white are ahead several points];W[ip];B[io];W[na];B[ma]
