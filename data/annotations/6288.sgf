C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game.  I think that I played really well in this game and I would like your opinion.  Also, How would you rank me,  I'm just asking for an estimate because I played this at home with my friend and don't use the internet often.

*** I'll mark my comments like this.

*** I think the game was played fairly well.  The only definite error that I noticed was in the upper right corner, but much later in the game than you were think.  I hope my comments were helpful.   

Please only comment on black's moves please.  Thank you!!!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]C[I really want you to evaluate my opening please because i've worked on that the most.]
;W[kq];B[de]C[was this ok

*** Yeah, it was ok.  I'd recommend a 3rd line approach since white is not in dange of developing their influence.]
;W[fc];B[dj]C[I think i extended too far

*** You're pretty far away and all stones are on the 4th line.  You're right to think that your stones don't work so well together.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[*** Never pincer an already pincered stone.  See my suggested variation]
;W[po]
(;B[op]C[was this a good response to whites attack

*** I don't particularly like it.  Sure, you're attacking Q5, but what secondary purposes do you have?  Attacking L3?  I added a variation with what I'd do.]
;W[of];B[nd]C[was this good

*** Yes, it's fine.  don't be afraid to make 4th line territory while your opponent desperately runs away.  As long as you keep your stones safe on the right, you're fine.]
;W[lc]
(;B[mf]C[tdon't think this did much

*** You have the right idea.  I added a variation for you to look at]
