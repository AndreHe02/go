C[Hi, I am Enfo, a KGS 9kyu. For some time now, the ranking system on the server has been frozen, so it has been hard to determine if I am improving. So my friend let me borrow his 6kyu account so I could get games with stronger players. I played a 5kyu this game. If this had been an even game with komi, I would have won by 2 points.

This is my first review request, so generally I'll be grateful for any sort of advice. My desire is to learn overall strategic concepts, especially in fuseki and middle game. If you see me make a move that shows my ignorance of some advanced Go principle, please let me know!

Thanks in advance for the review!.

JT: overall, you made no big mistakes, but you made some mistakes in direction, and you overplayed a bit while attacking. As a general rule, the areas with weak groups are the most urgent ones. Also, remember that it is usually best to attack from a distance, and to make territory while attacking when possible. Sometimes, it is not even necessary to actually attack, and it's often enough to make yourself stronger in a way that forces your opponent to defend.]
;B[qd]C[alfalfa [5k\]: hi

LB[cn:B][po:D][jp:C][fq:A]C[I think this is questionable. Like I mentioned, I think in terms of go principles. One principle I learned is that when there is a shimari on one side (such as in the top left corner), playing in middle is usually a big move to prevent them from making a big extension there. But now that I look at it, playing somewhere like k4 might have been better? What are the other major big moves at this point in the game?

JT: Since white ignored A, I think the double approach at B is better than C. Black will still be able to develop on the lower side later. Another move to consider is D (or another shimari) for quick territory. There's nothing wrong with this move, however.]
;W[qo];B[op]LB[cn:A]C[JT: I'd like to take A now.];W[pm];B[jq]
LB[qk:B][cn:A]C[Is this too low? I was afraid that if i went k4, it might make an invasion look a bit more appealing.

JT: this is okay, but I'd still like to play at A or possibly an agressive attack at B. It will be hard to settle the white group after that.]
;W[oc];B[pf];W[ld];B[lb];W[ne];B[fo]LB[fc:A]C[My friend said this move was a bit slow. What do you think?

JT: I think it's a mistake in direction - the upper group can now be attacked. I'd prefer simply A now to be safe there, it's also a big move.]
;W[cn];B[dr]C[JT: this looks like aji-keshi - the invasion later is bigger.]
;W[cq];B[qj];W[nm];B[rm]LB[mo:A]C[JT: I think this is overplay - better to just make moyo with A.]

LB[qj:A]C[I did a triple hane here because if white cuts, I would get a ponnuki towards the center. My s7 group would be severed but I read a bit ahead and saw that both variations it could live.

Was this right? Or would simply playing q12 have been better?

JT: yes, Q12 is better. The problem here is that after white captures A, he makes his group very strong in sente and destroys any potential on the right.]

(;B[cl]LB[pc:A]C[JT: I think this is a mistake in direction - black should take A now to take the corner and force white to run.]
;W[em];B[cj]LB[ek:A]C[JT: this looks quite dangerous - there's not a lot of eyespace in the left. I'd prefer to take A instead - the cut there is nothing to be afraid of.]
;W[fn]C[i wanted to nobi at g5, but i was afraid of my lonely c10 stone. So i let him rip into my moyo in order to make my group more safe.]

;W[oe]C[I wanted to kill this top group badly. N14 seemed as if it would take away the other eye, but I thought I needed strength on the right side first.

JT: I don't see any way to kill - N14 requires a very strong position in the center.]
