C[Thank you for requesting the review.       Black has selected an interesting game for review. I find it difficult to review a fighting game, because my depth of reading isn't that great.





However, there are some principles and joseki that are worth talking about, so here goes.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[fc]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[I would enclose the corner with a or b instead. Take the cash and create dual purpose moves if white approaches on the inside (var 2).





But f17, is fine];W[id]C[I like this move. The usual move (white d14) feels wrong if black plays j16 himself.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[db]
(;W[od]C[I would follow the joseki, if I were white ( white c17).





If black gets to play c17 himself the corner is wiped out, and black is alive.





Now, black doesnt need to helpf17 group, because c17 and j18 are miai.]
;B[pe]LB[oc:a][pf:b][oe:c][mc:d][ld:e]C[Q15 is not joseki, as far as I know. Common joseki moves are a thru e. I would discard the pincers (d and e) because white j16 would complicate matters.





var 1: the game

var 2: when q15 is joseki

var 3: black a (best for black)

var 4: black b

var 5: black c





The reason I believe q15 isn't joseki is 3-fold

1: It doesnt take the corner. Actually, it gives it to white





2: It doesnt put much pressure on p16. If p16 was at p17 (var 2) it would be better.





3: It is slow. the opening is generally about big moves and speedy development.]

(;W[ld];B[qj];W[qn];B[qo]C[Proper attack. n4 is certainly wrong here (white slides to s4)]
;W[pn];B[np];W[pj]C[I am not sure about white q10. I would probably just q8, or p9 if I felt adventurous.





Q10 seems to try to make sabaki (a light shape).];B[pi]C[var 1: the game, failed sabaki.

var 2: better sabaki]
(;W[qi]C[White is trying to make sabaki. It seems difficult to do.]
;B[qk]C[Very tough move. seems hard for white already];W[ph]
;B[oi];W[qh];B[ok]TR[ph][qh][qi][qn][pn]C[Wow. The game already seems very hard for white. He has two very weak groups (marked) surrounded by black stones. Seems one, if not both might die. Regardless, black should make great profit in the attack.]
;W[qc]C[R17 makes blacks original q15 look silly. White gets the corner.]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[oe];W[re]C[neat tesuji. I wouldn't have found it.]
;B[pd];W[oc];B[rd];W[qf];B[rg]C[I think this is premature.

If white gets p12, the net is no longer good. I would just cover at p12]
;W[qg];B[si]C[T11 does not connect with s13 for certain. (var 2).





Again I would just p12.]

;B[pm];W[or];B[pq];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr]C[liberty fight. black has 5. white has 4.]
;B[sp];W[so];B[sq]C[White has 3. black has 5. now he can tenuki twice.]
;W[rr];B[sm];W[qr];B[nf]C[good tenuki. great connection.];W[rh]
;B[ib]C[too small? Even if white take j18, black has c17. so it isnt necessary for life.





A covering move around l11 would seriously threaten white... and help black m13. black has great thickness, so it is fun to attack :-)]
;W[le]C[Wrong direction?





Maybe not. i guess this makes m14 a false eye. but i would play l11 for white. Help the weakest group.       By the way, the j16 stone is not important anymore. Once black makes life with f17 group, j16 becomes unimportant.]
;B[jg]
(;W[jb]C[Could white live if he played elsewhere and black played l18, m18, or m19?





I am not sure, but it seem likely.





In var 2, i try a straightforward attack after a white tenuki.]
;B[cc]TR[ng][nh][mh][mi][ph][qi][qh][rh][qg][qf][re]C[Very large.       Although, I believe that a move around l10 kills the marked stones and ends the game now.





But, if you cant read out a life and death problem, it is better just to play big moves.





Black is fine. the game is already in his favor.];W[cd]C[Probably too small to answer. (It is small because white is still open form c12 side, so territory is not sure.

;W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fr];W[jq]C[The lower side is now uninteresting. Too many stones on the second line. Black f2 threatens whatever territory white could make.





I think k3 is too small];B[jc];W[kb];B[ic];W[kc];B[jd]C[too small? capturing a single stone?]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[if];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[ji]C[What a painful sequence for white...

;W[jn];B[km]TR[jk][jl][lk][mi][mh][nh][ng][ph][qh][qi][rh][qg]
[qf][re]C[I think the marked stones are dead. White can make an eye in gote at s14... and maybe another by playing l11. No time to make both though.





Perhaps white can kill black's s17 dragon. It seems unlikely though.]
;W[in];B[sh]C[Not necessary, but understandable.];W[rj];B[sj]
;W[rk];B[sk];W[rf];B[sg];W[ij];B[ii]C[Black h11 is better?





h11 keeps the black stones connected. it also increases liberties on h10.





Now black can be cut. It would be a pity to lose a won game because of a little connection misread.]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[hk];B[gi];W[gk];B[ik];W[jj];B[gl]TR[hl][il][ik]
C[Well, black is cut... maybe white can kill something? Seems feasible, because white has a lot of friendly stones around.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[fn];W[em];B[gn];W[gp];B[en]C[White can give black a single eye. The important thing is to make sure b5 string and j6 stay alive. Then black is in trouble.

Thank you for requesting the review.





I hope my analysis of the fights is helpful. More importantly, I hope it is right!





Also, I spent some time on the joseki in the upper right. I hope that is helpful.]

Q15 threatens to push down on p17 and keep whites territory manageble.]
)
(;AE[pe]C[When choosing a joseki, the first thing to ask yourself is either adjacent side really big.





In this case that means the top side and the right side.





The top is very uninteresting to both sides. White doesnt have much territorial potential because of his thinness and the open skirt at black j18. Similarly, black wont be able to capture the whole top side either, because white has played two stones there. Very uninteresting.





The right side is more interesting. It is wide open. If there was a black stone at q10, I would say, it was really interesting for black. But there isn't so, it will be hard to develop too quickly





So, neither side is of OVERWHELMING importance. When that is true, just take the cash. In this case, that means take the corner. If white tries to deny you with the avalanche joseki, the right side will grow more important. See the variations that follow.]
;B[oc]C[This is probably the most common response to p16. The reason is simple, it usually takes the corner.
