C[Dear reviewer i'm Josep (baru) , i'm around 10k on kgs. i like to review this game, i play black, pls give some variations for black and white and tell me where is my mistake, so i can learn from that.

thank you

Erik: Hello Josep, thank you for letting me review this game.  
My comments will start with Erik:

I am a 3k on KGS so there might well be mistakes in my way to view the game.

Your great mistake in this game was of course the semai on the bottom.  Losing this cost in excess of 20 pts, I suspect that this was a fluke however.  If it was not then you might profitt from spending a few extra moments considering the outcome when there is threath against stones on both sides.
Even with this mistake you won the game so it can be said that you where well in control of this game.]
;B[jj]C[i'm now often to play tengen (k10) for the influence is it good or bad idea ?

Erik: There is no definite answer to that question.
If starting at tengen works for you then feel free to continue doing so.
I personally feels that it's preferable to wait and see, at least occuping two corners and seeing how white elects to start his corners befor spending a move to take tengen.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[cd];B[pp];W[fc];B[pj];W[dl]C[Erik: I think this is questionable.  It is too wide to be considered connected to d4 and too narrow as a moyo building move.]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[Erik: This move is bad white should prefer a pincer or a move that strenghtens the connection between d4 and d8.  This move acomplishes little when white lacks a stone around k4.]
;B[fp]
(;W[mq]C[Erik: This move is a huge mistake.
As a preferrence a high pincer at J4 would be preferrable.]
;B[jq];W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[mp];B[nq];W[nr];B[qq]
(;W[pr]C[Erik: 
Net result:
Black: good base for the stones on the left.  strenghtened influence on the right. Sente.
White:  a neglible amount of territorry.]
(;B[cp]C[is this the right spot to invade white or i should play another move ?

Erik:  This is not so good.  It is far too early for invations this deep.  My preference would be K16.]

Erik: No, there is defects in whites shape.];W[em]
(;B[cm]C[Erik: now the issue is a bit more in doubt, white can get a ko, but he has no ko threats and if he loses it then black will kill white's group.]

(;W[dk]C[Erik: a hanging connection is better here.  This since white has a weakness at E6.]
;B[aq];W[cs]C[erik: This is largely a wasted move. white should take sente.]
;B[mc]C[Erik: This is too narrow, K16 is better, the reason is the fact that your corner is still open to invasion.  Also K16 works better with K10.]

;W[ol];B[pm];W[oj];B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[lf];B[fn]C[i wasn't sure about this move, is it good ? , can i cut white groups  at e6 ?

Erik: you can cut, by sacrificing a stone at E6 then playing E8.  But you should not cut since your cutting stone would be extremely weak.  Still the fact that there might be a cut means that F6 should not be played, it strenghtens white far more than it strenghtens yourself.]

The semai should have been won by black, so if you rememeber to cut and to keep taking liberties from white your gameline would kill white.]
