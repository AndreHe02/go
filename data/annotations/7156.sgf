C[Hi reviewer! I am playing black in this match and just for your reference I play for a moyo (in case that isn't obvious from my play ;)) so that might explain some of my moves. Any tips on the correct play, better moves, or proper moves don't hesitate to say so! Also, any tips for yose would be much appreciated as I am weak at it! Thank you very much!

Hi
Call me Zamoth as my name is Thomas.  I'll be pleased to review your game !
What I think about this game is that white should have win it !  He did very well in the opening ... but missed some serious fight in the center.  If he had not, black would have lost ... badly]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[nq];B[oo]LB[pn:A][kp:B][lq:C]
C[Should this have been at somewhere like A, B or C?

Zam : I would have pincered ... maybe at C.  This is an unusual play, I would not play so high ... but at this stage it is notvery  important.]
;W[qn]C[Zam : This is not a good move by white ... looks for complications in a weak spot so early .  Black now can attack the side he wants and take a lead in the fight]
;B[pm]C[I play for moyo and influence so this is simply my style!]
;W[rp];B[mp]C[Zam : I do not like this move ... previous moves gained influence in the center ... But this is too much, and it doesn't give any points.  White tenukies, and he is right about it letting off O3 stone. I would play R3 to gain the corner, and to split stones away]
;W[hd];B[de]C[Good time to approach?

Zam : No, too early. White already has two stones in this area ... and there are so many open points left on the board !]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[ef]LB[dg:A]C[I thought this may have been wrong... at the time I was aiming for the center but would A have been better?

Zam : A or D14 would have been fine.  Playing a stone toward the center is good if you mean to fly away.]
;W[qm];B[fd]C[Too small?

Zam : does not kill ... does not make territory ... does not add much inflence in the center]
;W[rj]C[Zam : Slow move, white group is alive, this is on the second line ... The opening is not finished yet ...]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[nd];B[ne]TR[rj]C[Zam : I would play O17 ... because white can invade your moyo because of S10 stone]
;W[md];B[me];W[bf];B[cg];W[mq]
(;B[dk]LB[dk:A][cn:B][lp:a]C[Too close?
Would it have been better to respond at A first before the extension?

Zam : your top left group is very strong ... I would have been more greedy playing C6.  If white pincers, you can push him toward your strong group to attack the bottom. See var]
;W[lq]C[Zam : This is big for white !];B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[jp]
;B[jo];W[qq];B[ld]C[Was this good?

Zam : Yes this is good !];W[hf];B[ie]C[Is there a better way to attack these stones while strengthening my own?

Zam : It depends on what you want to save.  This is a forcing move.  I have not much to say about it]
;W[he];B[gg];W[ig];B[jf];W[kh]C[Zam : White group is not a safe group ... this is welcoming a cut.]
;B[hg]C[Zam : Very bad move for black, there is no ne to force two stone to connect.  White should have connected, of course
White NEEDS to connect, see var]
(;W[ii];B[jg];W[kj]C[Zam : White is really looking for trouble.  Se var]

;W[ik];B[jh];W[ki];B[ji];W[jj];B[hj];W[mk];B[mj]C[Zam : If you played H10, that meant you think cutting is a good point.  So cut, or don't play H10]
;W[fn];B[ip]C[Zam : Good, white should have pushed one more here]

;W[rc];B[qf];W[pq];B[jq];W[kq];B[fq]TR[io][lo][np][iq]C[Was this not good? Seems non-urgent...

Zam : This leaves so many cutting points !!! so extending fortifies black bottom position.  Beware, white can still get out his center stones]
;W[fc];B[gc]C[Misread and trying for too much...];W[if];B[hh]
;W[je]C[Zam : since white played J14, he should have played J12 too]
;B[id];W[ih];B[ke];W[jd];B[kd];W[ic];B[kf]C[Zam : White had nothing to fear, he should have connected]
