Steffen (and GTL coordinator)

Here is the the completed game review that you requested. Sorry it took
so long!

I hope this will help you in your study of go. I'm not entirely certain
that I completely answered your questions so if you need clarification
or have more questions, feel free to send me an email (about this game
only, please.)

I used WinMGT to create this file.

igs.nuri.net 6969]RE[B+30.5]TM[600]US[Brought to you by IGS]C[Your prime
question is about preventing your opponent from making huge territories,
and answering claims for huge territories.

I will definitely talk about specific moves (tactics), but I feel it is
important to consider strategy, the whole board position, and style.

So when I talk about a possible better move elsewhere, think about not
just "well, in this specific situation I have THIS move", which is
memorization, but also think about "what concept can I learn here, what
new way of thinking can I train in myself so I can recognize these
options in the future."

I hope you find this review helpful.];B[op];W[cd];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp]
;W[ec];B[dj]LB[dg:a][cn:b]C[The next move is D13 (a). Take a look at the
board after this move and compare it to playing C6 instead. If you are
going to play on the left side, C6 or D6 strengthens your weakest
stone.  D13 provokes black to play an extension that helps him.]
(;W[dg];B[cn];W[co]C[By attaching to a weak stone, you help strengthen
it. I just took a lesson from yly (Yilun Yang, a 7d professional) and he
made a big point of this about two of my moves in the game. There are
times when contacting is ok,
though.];B[do];W[cp];B[ch];W[cg];B[dm];W[bh]C[Black has a strong
presence on the left side now. Your upper white group is completely
safe, so you should ignore this and play elsewhere.];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]
;W[pj]CR[qj]LB[qh:a][ql:b]C[Perhaps this stone could have been played
one line lower at R10. Black is high in the nearby corners and you don't
have center stones on the top or bottom to run to. Notice how black
plays from his weak side at a, rather than from his strong side at
b.];B[qh]LB[qi:a][pm:b]C[The next move was R11 (a). Again, this is
contacting a weak stone. Try R7 (b). Since black has so many stones on
this side you are at a disadvantage. R14 would be playable as well,
possibly making it easier to get a good result.];W[qi];B[qk];W[ph]C[The
previously open side has become extremely cramped for your
group.];B[qg];W[pm]
;B[qm];W[pk];B[qn]TR[pd][op]C[Black's stones are now low but your right
side white group has little chance for territory and doesn't exert much
influence, because of the marked stones, P4 and Q16.

Consider R8. Black would have to respond and you would retain sente, but
your stones would be more firmly connected.];W[nc]C[If you're going to
play at the top, consider L16. This move allows black to pincer you too
closely.];B[jc];W[kb]C[This move is a little too close to
black.];B[kc]C[L17 now forces you to defend. If L18 had been at M18, you
could play H17 or Q18 next.];W[lc];B[jb];W[lb]
;B[fc]C[This move isn't so great. F16, G17, H17, and H18 all come to
mind as ways to put pressure on black. I'm not sure what I would have
played.];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[ed];B[ge]C[Your upper right white
group is starting to look very lonely. Q18 is now
urgent.];W[jf]CR[pg][pb]C[K14 doesn't accomplish very much, your UR
white group is weak and the upper black group has easy access to the
center and at least one eye on top.

Consider Q14 and  Q18. Note that black played around these points right
after this!];B[oc];W[nd]C[O16 is better at P18. If you're trying to cut
black off from the center, then perhaps O15 would be better, although It
doesn't look to me like the center can yield much territory here at this
point.]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[jp];W[nq];B[mq];W[np];B[oq]CR[nr][mp]LB[no:a]C[Consider
O3 or N4 instead of O5 (a). Invading on the bottom and then letting
black connect so easily are contradictory.];W[no];B[nr];W[hq]C[The O5
stones really just helped black make territory on the bottom. They don't
do much toward making territory in the center, as they are short on
liberties and not securely connected to other white stones.]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[fq];W[ep];B[eq]CR[eo]C[Consider E5 instead of
F4.]LB[fp:a];W[fp];B[dp];W[dr];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn]
;W[br]C[B2 is overly submissive. you've got the F3 stones for sure ifyou
play ];B[gr];W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[is];W[gq]C[As long as you watch the
liberties of this white group, you don't have to worry about those black
stones. Playing a move to help control the center would help this white
group more than G3. You could play J4 and black would have to respond
(or lose the J3 stones. Then K5 or another center move.];B[fo]C[This
would have been ok for black, except the D5 stones are short of
liberties. Try E5 instead of G5.];W[go]CR[kq]C[J4 or L3 would be fun to
play with here. G5 doesn't gain any clear tactical or strategic
goal.];B[eo]
;W[gp];B[gn]C[Note the white group is now sort of clumpy and is down to
3 liberties. For me, being reduced to 3 liberties is like a big
signboard that says "Hello! ARE YOU SAFE?"];W[gj]C[I'm not sure where
G10 is aimed. Are you looking for center territory? N4, P5, R8, P13, and
possibly G13 are closer to the action.
The center looks too open to become real territory, and black looks like
he'll get the whole right side.];B[eh];W[dh];B[di];W[ff]C[It would have
been playable to cut at E11. Even if later you gave up that stone you
could use it to put pressure on the top black group and gain territory
at the same time.];B[eg];W[ef];B[fi]C[This is the perfect opportunity
for G14 or G13. You can gain profit in the center by attacking the top
black group (without really trying to kill it unless it truly seems
easy.)];W[gi]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[gg]C[G14 still isn't too late to play, which was your
next move.];W[gf];B[hg]C[Rather than being concerned about the center,
play H14. Black will be forced to make the group live and doesn't have
time to fiddle too much with the center.];W[ih];B[hf]C[Letting black
connect so easily makes his day! ];W[kk]C[The center still doesn't look
very secure. If black now played K8, he could easily connect to the left
or bottom groups. He could play a similar move at N14, and could take
serious chunks out of the center. You have definite attacking moves on
the sides and bottom that you can play before aiming for the
center.];B[ip]C[This move should set off alarm bells in your head! Your
bottom clumpy white group is down to two liberties, and it can be
rescued by playing H6 or F2. In this case, H6 looks like the better bet.
If you can connect it to other white stones you won't have to waste
moves capturing while black squeezes.];W[mp]C[M2 could be interesting
here, or M3 as well.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[ho];W[er];B[gs];W[lm];B[pl]C[Black secures the side in
sente and starts denting your
territory.];W[ol];B[ql];W[om];B[og];W[ng];B[nf]
;W[mg];B[mf]C[Your top white group doesn't have two eyes and is about to
be cut off from the center. you can play M14 here, or M16 if you're not
sure how you'd fight it out. See variation.

(;W[lg];B[ld]C[The moves I'd start with to try and live might be L16,
N16, M15, N14. I think I like N14, see variation.]

by either player are not
needed.];W[nb];B[ka];W[md];B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[kd]
;B[of];W[ke];B[ie];W[fl]C[F8 doesn't take away much territory from
black. You'd do better to take territory for yourself at
J8.];B[fm]C[Black wasted a move here. K8 would be more
productive.];W[gl];B[il]C[Now you can see that F8 and G8 lost more than
they gained.];W[jn];B[in];W[jm];B[im];W[ij]

is a little defensive. How about J13 instead.];B[ji];W[ii]
;B[kh];W[jg]C[K13 isn't needed, you've got enough liberties you can play
elsewhere.];B[lj]C[N10 would keep black low on liberties and is no
danger to you. N11 just lets black mess around some
more.];W[mi];B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[ri];B[ok];W[oj];B[nk];W[nl]
