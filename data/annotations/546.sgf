C[Dear Friend:
I have made some variations. I don't know if these are better than
the game or there are other better variations. Please make commends.
Thank you very much.


Hello aune,
this was an interesting game to look through. I checked your
variations and made some comments where I could. Have fun!

      weakknee];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[eq];B[dn];W[pd]TR[eq]C[Just a small thing: I don't like the exchange e3 - d6 so much for
black. If
white plays the marked stone at q16 immediately, then B usually moves to e3.
So there is a feeling of white having forced black along a bit.]

(;B[qf]LB[nc:a][dq:b][iq:c]C[If you want to approach the upper right corner, the other side (a)
would be
more usual, as it works with your other stones (var). You could also play
on the lower side (at (b) or at (c)) to put pressure on the marked stone,
but maybe it's better to keep that for later.];W[nc];B[rd];W[hp]
;B[nq]LB[qn:a]C[Hmm this is tough. Usually on the other side at (a). With O3, chances
are
that you end up with too many small low positions.];W[lq];B[qq]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qn]TR[qf][rd]C[This result looks nice for white: the marked black stones approach the
upper right corner from the less interesting direction.];W[qc]
;B[qi];W[de]LB[om:a][qm:b]C[Risky ... I would prefer strengthening the lower side first with the
exchange W(a) - B(b). The right side is not tempting for a white
invasion anyway.];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb];W[ch];B[cj]
;W[jd]C[Big, but the lower side looks much more urgent.];B[jq]
C[Very nice invasion!];W[hq];B[jo];W[lo];B[dq];W[ep];B[jm]C[Another nice move, and a very good result for black!]
;W[cl]LB[co:a][jr:b]C[This looks like an overplay. White is trying to use the bad potential
at (a), but whites groups on the lower side are too weak for much action.
I think W should connect underneath at (b) first and wait for a chance
to invade the left later. How about trying to split whites groups
(variation)?]
(;B[dl];W[dm];B[em];W[cm];B[dk];W[bo];B[co]C[You are right, the push along the side would have been a bit better for
white, because if you (B) choose to connect with the hanging connection
at E5 later, some ko aji remains for the lower left group (see the variation
next move)]
(;W[cn]LB[ir:a]C[The hanging connection in your variation is better. It leaves some
small shape problems, but you don't need a defensive move at G6 as in
the game and can start an attack immediately (at (a))]
(;B[do];W[bk];B[bj];W[bm];B[bp];W[an]LB[gn:a][fm:b][fo:c]C[Very painful to live like this. A4 instead of A6 does not work.

For black, the cut at E6 needs defending. My favourite is (c) (puts
more pressure on the white group); (b) does not patch up the shape
properly (interesting idea though). (a) as played in the game looks OK
too.]
(;B[gn]N[(a)];W[jr]LB[eh:a][cf:b][lc:c]C[It is too early to continue at the bottom for black (aji keshi). The
opportunity won't run away, because white can't patch up without losing
a move. Later it will be easier to choose between the variations.

Instead, you could lean on the weak marked group from outside (a) or
take its eyes away (b). Another choice is the invasion at (c); if
white connects outside you are well ahead on territory.]
(;B[kr]C[This is very dubious. Even if you live, a 2 point life is not worth
giving
up sente for. However, even getting life is very hard; in fact I think
that black dies on the edge (see the variations later on)];W[kq]
;B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hr]LB[js:a]C[The capturing attempt white (a) does not work, as shown in the
variation.]
(;W[gr];B[js]
(;W[lr]LB[ls:a][pn:b]C[This white move misses a big chance. I think white can kill at (a).
If white is afraid of the complications (it is a very close capturing race),
an alternative would be to play at (b) first. If black answers on the right,
the kill at (a) becomes much easier, and if not, white gains a lot on the
right.];B[hs];W[eh]LB[pn:a][lc:b]C[Still, white is happy to strengthen his group here.

Now that whites marked group is strong(er), a black invasion at (b)
is not so effective. pushing at (a) as in the game to build thickness
first looks better.]
(;B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[nn]LB[nm:a][lc:b]C[I still think the invasion at (b) is too early.]

(;B[nm];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm]
(;B[nk]LB[lc:a][hc:b]TR[nk]C[The marked move covers a cutting weakness, but I think this
is too slow. You could look at the pushing moves as forcing
moves, because white didn't gain anything by answering. Now
would be a better time to invade at (a), or try the more peaceful
territory move like (b).];W[ph]C[Nice timing!];B[qh];W[pf];B[pg]
;W[og];B[qg];W[gc]C[Now the position is reversed. White has territory and black
has to secure the top left group. Black is ahead, but not by
much.];B[gb];W[hb]

;W[id];B[gh];W[ig];B[ff];W[bi];B[aj];W[bf]C[Safety first ... it is tough for white to have to
make life in gote by playing inside. However, it seems neccessary
(if white ignores this move, he'll at least get pushed down
to a very small life).];B[pe];W[of];B[oe];W[ne];B[od];W[oc]

;W[ll]LB[mj:a][li:b][oj:c]C[This move only strengthens black in the wrong direction.
Playing at (a) immediately looks better. But I would
prefer (b), which surrounds the territory better and aims at (c).]
