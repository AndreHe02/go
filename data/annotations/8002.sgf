C[Hello, I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

So let's see what we got here. :-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[de];W[pp]
;B[jd]
(;W[dc]C[Hon: It is a normal thing to kakari a takamoku like this, but black is aiming on a whole board moyo, and your two hoshi stones also want influence, so maybe you should think about something else too.]
;B[fd]
(;W[fc]C[Hon: No need to touch him here I think.];B[gc];W[ed]
;B[fb];W[ee];B[ec];W[dd]C[Hon: This sequence looks like being almost forced. Black is very solid, but maybe a bit too much of it. 

On the other hand D15 might still move later, so it is not clear, what white has accomplished - no real strength, no real points.]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[Hon: Maybe the wrong pincer.];B[en]
(;W[di]C[Hon: Mistake.]
(;B[bp]C[Hon: Thanks, black.];W[fp];B[cq];W[dq];B[kq]
(;W[cp];B[br];W[bo];B[co];W[bn];B[bm];W[cm];B[an];W[dn];B[ao]
;W[do]C[Hon: I did certainly not know this pattern when I was 4k. Respect!

But strategically I am not sure if this is good. White has gote, so black will settle at the lower side right now, and then the meaning of the wall is not clear.

Also D11 has lost a lot of its value, now that black can jump in from the lower left all the time. All in all white's stones do not seem to cooperate so well.]
;B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn]LB[qm:B][qn:A]C[Hon: I think this is not good. 

Since this area is largest now, white should decrease the value of a black move in this area and choose A or B.]
(;B[db]C[Hon: This can not be good. It is a large move, but it is endgame!

The right side is wide open!];W[qf]C[Hon: Good.];B[nd];W[pj]
;B[hq]C[Hon: This move is also large, white would have liked it. But you can't have them all.]
;W[lc]LB[qc:C][of:B][nr:A]C[Hon: This invasion is not really necessary, there are still many large moves on the board, like A to C.

White is only making himself a target.];B[mc];W[ld];B[nf];W[jc]
;B[qe]C[Hon: Bad.

It's surprising how often you see this move, but I saw even other 2ds playing it.]
;W[pf]C[Hon: Black just repaired white's shape here, so white can be grateful.

I understand that black wants to guard his territory, but it is pointless to take profit, if you give the opponent more than that voluntarily. This is the essence of vulgar play: Helping the opponent on his mission. One should instead be trying to improve the own position without helping the opponent to improve his - that is called good style.]
;B[ql]C[Hon: First black strenghtens white, then he gets panic and invades.]
;W[qk];B[ol]
(;W[qm]C[Hon: Locally this move seems to connect, but it leaves the corner open.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[or];W[rq]C[Hon: Slow. The usual move is Q2, but it also is gote. That's why it was so big to prevent R3 in the first place.

Since this move is passive, black should take sente now.];B[pr]
C[Hon: Over creating one of his own, black forgot that there was a weak group to attack.]
;W[id]C[Hon: Consequently white defends it.];B[bc];W[bd];B[cc]
;W[cd]
(;B[dh]C[Hon: If black wants to invade, he should not play B17 first, but keep it for later.

It is very interesting to see what happens now. White will try to protect this territory, and in the process he gets plastered from the outside.]
(;W[eh];B[dj]
(;W[ci]C[Hon: White leaves a cutting point.];B[ck]
(;W[bl];B[bk];W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[fj];W[bj]C[Hon: In an area, where white is supposed to be strong, he must play a defensive move like this.]
;B[dl]
(;W[em]
(;B[ei]C[Hon: Something is going terribly wrong.];W[eg]
(;B[hj]
(;W[pl]C[Hon: This move got no meaning, since Q8 and S8 were miai.

Why is this one stone so valuable?

Now white starts to do the same thing on the right - thinking only about the defence of his points while ignoring what black gets on the other side.]
;B[ad]
(;W[be];B[re];W[rf];B[gf];W[fm]C[Hon: E7 and E8 together now captured E6. This is not really efficient.]
;B[bi];W[ai];B[fh];W[je];B[dr];W[er];B[fg];W[ff];B[fe];W[ef]
;B[ae];W[af];B[ac];W[bf];B[hg]
(;W[nn];B[nh];W[nj];B[oi]C[Hon: Bitter.];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[oj]
(;W[ok];B[nk];W[pk];B[mk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm]C[Hon: White missed the point to do something actively and ended up walled in again.]
;B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[rh]C[Hon: Somehow black ended up getting all the large endgame plays: Q2, S15, C17. White did miss his opportunities to take sente and take some profit of his own.]
;B[mb]C[Hon: And here the last large one.

End of comment.

At this point, white has lost the game. He made some strategically not so good decisions, and he took gote at the wrong places. 

Now in hindsight we see, that it was wrong to overvalue the left side, since after the strange sequence in the upper left there was not much to hope for. The side became cramped and open at the bottom. Still, white fought hard to defend every point here - but for what price!

On the lower side, where a white wall points, black sits solidly, having all the points. The stones white stones on the lower and left sides did not cooperate. 

On the upper side we see a very small group, weakish, which helped black to settle his territories left and right, and will ensure him some more points in the center. We should be more hesitant about invasions. They are just destructive, but they don't create points.

On the right side white eagerly protected every point and ended up with a cramped, overconcentrated position. This was a moyo, and moyos are usually traded for something else. For example for the upper right, which was open for a long time.

All in all I feel that white is too protective about his territory. If you think too much about protecting points, you become the enemy's toy - he bullies you from the outside and builds up at the same time. Black built up this huge center influence solely by threatening to destroy white's points.

There is a lot to be said about all this, since it is a complicated matter that will not leave us as long as we play go. Let me put it yet another way: Protecting territory and destroying territory by invasion are somewhat negative strategies - and both lead to cramped positions. One needs to be more flexible. Instead of protecting points or destroying points we should concentrate on increasing. If your opponent builds up his positions, you should just do the same. And if the opponent invades, you should concentrate on attacking him, not on keeping what you can. 

Go is the game of miai - if your opponent takes a large point, you go and take another. I hope I succeeded in giving you some ideas how to make your stones cooperate better and how to play more actively.]

White makes something like a coherent structure on the left side, but he's paying a price on the lower side. Why is white compromising? 

Even as it stands, the left side can be invaded, so D11 is not worth it.]

(;B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bk];W[jq]C[Hon: Something like this also seems alright for me.

I think it is important not to overvalue the left side. White's shape in the top left does not have a clear meaning, D15 is not dead, so maybe it is better to keep the situation here flexible instead on insisting on points here.]

;B[cn]C[Hon: Black can just start another one though, but this is natural, since you entered the corner. 

I think, white will be alright though, since D10 is not in so good a place. It is largely a matter of style. If you're a good reducer, this can work.]
