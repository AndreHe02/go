C[Hi Brian,

I'm glad to review your game, this was a fun exercise for me too.

I'm not that much stronger than you, maybe KGS 3d on a good day, but I think I have some useful comments on the game. I think I have even played both you and zzyy before as Milo234.

My comments are sparse, but hopefully helpful. I didn't comment much past the ko fight because if you see my analysis, the game was basically over after the ko fight. Last comment move 163

White seems clearly to be the stronger player, and seemed to be leading until the major ko. After the ko it was probably impossible for white to come back.

According to one of my favorite online joseki websites it is officially "questionable". The "proper" continuation according to the website is shown in the variation.]

(;W[dj];B[hq]C[Considering the website, the proper continuation for black is probably to invade the corner.]

C[Milo234: If white plays the triangle place, white gets a very good result. Difficult move to find and difficult follow up are both required.]

(;W[km];B[jm];W[im];B[jl];W[il];B[am]C[Milo234: I feel like the pushing sequence that follows is bad for white. The pushes do not seem to have a clear objective, particularly the final nose hit. They make black stronger thus weakening the stones on the right half of the board. 

It is always difficult to decide which side to push from if you can push from one side or the other. Yilun Yang one time gave me some good advice regarding how to determine which side to push from. Your priorities in pushing should be.
1. Strengthen your weak groups
2. Push to build thickness towards where the biggest points are.

My perference here is to make the weak white stones solid, and leave the blacks floating in the middle of the board. There are many ways to do this. See the variation for one.]

(;W[qf]C[Milo234: Ladder breaker or not, this feels extremely premature. Black's simplest response, to take the white stone off the board, leaves the life of the white stones in question, and is almost sure sente giving black perfect thickness. It seems like white should strengthen the surrounded stones.

White missed several opportunities to live. White is in this bad situation as a result of the pushes from earlier.]

(;B[pg];W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[rn]C[I think black could have chosen a better move to try to kill the whites. R6 is my choice for black here.]
;W[pk];B[pj]TR[oj]C[White's next move at triangle is clearly a major mistake as the game showed. White should be aiming to just live unless he can find a fighting variation that works for him. White P9 gives white a good result.]

[oi:B]C[This is a really really big ko threat for black, and I think white shouldn't ignore it.. Black doesn't have any ko threats for the life of the whites in the lower left, so black probably won't be able to find a bigger threat. White still has 2 local ko threats, A then B.]
