C[Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS.

I will start my comments with W:

Let's take a look at the game. : )

---

Hi, I'm memolano, 11 Kyu at the time when I played this game. I played white.

I am not familiar playing agains the chinese opening so I didn't know how to respond better. I make a couple of obvious mistakes in this game, both in the lower left and the bottom left. But other than that I don't know how I could have played better.

I managed to win this game by a few moves, but only because my opponent kept responding to my moves. He could have left me with no territory.

Could you please show me how to play better.

I really appreciate you taking the time to review this game.
Thank you.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[qk];W[nc]

C[W: This is a very bad move, since White can remove Black's eyes later.

In this position, White has 7 stones against Black's single stone.

This means, White is strong in this area, and Black is weak in this area]
(;W[fp]C[W: Touching weak stones is bad, as it makes them stronger.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[gq]TR[fp]SQ[jp][jq]C[Reviewing the game, I think this move is aweful. It gave my opponent a nice wall towards the bottom right. The problem is that I'm still not sure of where to play.

Where would you play?

W: The mistake was earlier, the touch move of F4. White should have played elsewhere, such as a pincer at K4 area.]
