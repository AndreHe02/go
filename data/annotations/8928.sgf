C[s: Hello - my name is Sam Tregar, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I play as samtregar on KGS at around 3 kyu.  I'm certainly not an expert but I'll do my best to point out areas where you could improve your play.  Please feel free to email with any questions you have to sam@tregar.com.  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".]
;B[pd]C[gravie [12k?\]: good luck & have fun];W[dp]C[Skookum [13k\]: Same]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[de]LB[ce:A][fq:B]C[s: I think this is playable, but I think it's more common to play A to attack this corner.  Also, this move doesn't really coordinate well with the stones you already have on the board.  I think if I was anxious to attack a corner now I would play around B.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[jc];B[lc]C[s: I like this move - it puts preasure on white and expands your potential territory.  Looking for moves that serve more than one purpose is important in Go.]
;W[qj];B[cj];W[cl];B[jq]LB[cg:A][fq:B]C[s: I think this is ok - it's definitely a big move - but I would have probably reinforced after white's advance with A.  If you don't play there then it becomes a big move for white since it threatens to split up your groups.  If you do want to play on the bottom I think you need to go further around B.  Otherwise...]
;W[gq]C[s: ... white can play like this and get the very desirable two-wing formation.  Now you'll have to either allow white a very big corner or play inside and give white nice influence in the center.]
;B[qn]LB[cg:A][qg:B][jj:C][cq:D]C[s: This move is really small - much too small for this early stage of the game.  It's not a bad move per-se but when so much of the board is empty you have to think big.  I'd say A, B or even C are bigger.  You also have to be thinking about when you're going to play D.]
;W[qg];B[qf];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[oe];W[pg]C[s: Small and not really very threatening - you should probably have ignored this.]
;B[pf];W[og];B[of]C[s: This is a really bad move - it's gains you precisely nothing to play here.  Your group is already perfectly safe and this move neither puts preasure on white nor expands your territory.]
;W[qq]C[s: On the other hand, this is perfect!  White should live here and if you'd played here instead of last move you'd have secured your position (not that it's necessarly the best move for you, but it's often true in Go that a good move for your opponent is a good move for you!).]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[qo];B[po];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[rs];W[rq];B[pj]LB[pk:A][on:B]TR[pn]C[s: This is a bit over-ambitious when you have the weakness I marked.  I think A or B would be better.]
;W[pk];B[qk]C[s: Ouch.  This is what's known as running your head into a wall.  You're making white stronger and your stones weaker when you do this.]
;W[rk];B[nj]LB[oj:B][pj:A][ok:C]TR[qk][ql][qm][qn]C[s: Danger!  Looking at the marked stones should make you nervous.  White will be thinking about how he can trap them since they're down to three liberties and the stone at A is also weak now.  You could prevent this by playing B instead, or C.  A two-space jump like you made is fine when the stones you're jumping from are safe, but not good here.]
;W[ok];B[pn]LB[nj:A][oj:B]C[s: You lost a move here because of A, and you'll have to play B soon anyway (actually white should play that now!).]
;W[nl];B[oj];W[ll]TR[nj][oj][pj]C[s: Good move by white - he's threatening the marked stones and making your potential territory on the bottom smaller.]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[rg]LB[oj:B][rj:A]C[s: I really don't like this move.  All you have to do is capture at A and your game gets much simpler.  By creating a Ko instead you just make your life harder and ultimately get less.]
;W[qh];B[rj];W[sj];B[rh];W[qj];B[pi];W[mh];B[ng]C[s: Good move.  When you see the L shape, always look for this!]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[mg];B[nf];W[mf];B[me]LB[cg:A][cq:B]C[s: This move looks slow to me.  Consider how much bigger a play at A or B would be now.  Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in the flow of a fight and play moves that are really too small for the stage of the game.]
;W[le];B[ld]C[s: Also really small.   Your group is quite safe - sieze the initiative and play in a big open space!]
;W[ke];B[kd]LB[jd:A]TR[lc][ld]C[s: Very, very slow.  Also poor shape - the marked stones form the "empty triangle" which is the least efficient shape in Go.  If you want to play to separate these groups I'd start with A, although I don't think it's the biggest place to play now.]
;W[je];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[gc];B[fe]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[db];B[ee]C[s: This sequence is ok - it's good to keep your opponents groups separated, but you've also helped him build solid territory where he only had potential before.  And you didn't get much for your trouble.  That's not a good combination...]
;W[lj]LB[mk:A]C[s: Excellent move from white here - threatens to connect two weak groups and maybe save them both.  However, it does have a weak point - black must think about when and how to play A.  Any time you see this box formation you must consider playing at A.]
;B[hj]LB[kg:B][mk:A]C[s: I think this is really too kind of black.  If you want to attack, attack!  Start with A or B.]
;W[ii];B[hi]C[s: This only helps white save his groups, and it's very slow.]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[ej]LB[dk:A]C[s: Bold move from white!  I'd play A and make him fight for it.]
;B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[dj];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh]
;B[bg];W[cg];B[bf];W[dh];B[bl];W[bm];B[al];W[bk];B[ck];W[dk]
;B[ak];W[dl];B[ai];W[ah];B[ag];W[aj];B[pb];W[bk];B[qb];W[rb]
;B[oa];W[qa];B[na];W[sb];B[sd]LB[ra:B][sd:A]C[s: Wasted move - white is already dead here.  If he plays A then you need only play B to kill and vice-versa.]
;W[cf];B[be];W[ce];B[cd];W[eg];B[fg]LB[gf:A]C[s: If you want to connect, play A.]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[if]C[s: Strange moves here - you're just giving stones and territory to white with nothing in return.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[jg];B[kf];W[lf];B[ff];W[ge];B[bb];W[ad];B[ba]
;W[bd];B[ac];W[eh];B[cq]C[s: At last!  it might be too late now, since white has a lot of help on the upper side to lean on, but I think you should still live.  It's probably too far away to help.  (The way you actually played white should have been able to kill you, but that's just a matter of learning the corner moves which you can lookup in any joseki book.)]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[ep];W[fq];B[bp];W[eo];B[dr]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[ap];B[aq];W[es];B[ds];W[br];B[bs];W[kp]C[s: I love this move.  It's another great dual-use move - threatens your territory while expanding white's (big) center.  Always looks for moves like this!]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[ip];B[np]LB[jo:B][jp:A]C[s: Too slow.  White gave you an opening, take it!  A is the move, or maybe B.]
;W[no];B[op]LB[mk:B][hl:A]C[s: Ouch.  This is much too slow and not even really needed.  Your group is quite safe and you need to counter-attack to limit white's center.  I think A would be a good start.  B is still great too...]
;W[nn];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko];W[kn];B[io];W[jn];B[in];W[il];B[hl]
;W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hk];W[im];B[hn]LB[hp:A]TR[in][io]C[s: You must stop making the empty triangle!  A is best here I think.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[fl];B[hp];W[ho];B[iq];W[hq];B[io];W[gp];B[ip]
;W[in];B[hr];W[ij];B[ik];W[jk];B[ol];W[nk];B[nm];W[mm];B[om]
;W[kb];B[lb];W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[kc];W[jb];B[ca];W[ec];B[da]
;W[ea];B[fs];W[aa];B[ae]LB[mi:E][rj:B][gk:C][ao:D][gr:A]C[s: White can force you to play this eventually, but it's hardly the biggest move now.  A, B, C, D, E all look beter.]

Skookum [13k\]: Thanks, that was a good game (except I lost :) )
gravie [12k?\]: But still u played well
Skookum [13k\]: Same, take care, good luck with the rest of your tournement games
gravie [12k?\]: yes good luck to u too

s: Thank you for letting me review your game.  I hope my comments were helpful.  Overall I think your opening play is quite good - it's your middle game play that could use improvement.  You need to be more aggressive and try to look harder for the biggest moves to play.  You tended to follow your opponent's play too easily.  I like to think of Go as a conversation.  When your opponent plays he's saying "I think this is my territory."  You can say "yes, I agree" and play along with him or "hell no!"  Every game has some of both but I think your play needs more "hell no!" :)  Sure, sometimes you'll be proved wrong but you have to risk that to win.  Also, studyiing basic shapes would help you - some of your moves formed shapes that are basically wrong (like the empty triangle) which you can easily learn to avoid.  One way to do that is to review higher-level games - you'll see the kind of shapes that stronger players make and you can emulate them.  If you like to read books about Go I would recommend Janice Kim's books - the lessons there have helped me at every stage.

Good luck and thanks again!])
