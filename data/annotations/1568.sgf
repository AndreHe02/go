C[W: Both white and black are somewhere around 19kyu.];B[dp]
;W[qp];B[cd];W[pc];B[ec];W[cj]C[w: too low?

I don't think so. Locally, this is a fine move. But I don't think this is too urgent - if Black plays around here, he is putting all his stones on one side of the board, and there are still invasion points.]
;B[cm];W[cg];B[jp]
(;W[qe]C[I'd be more tempted by P3. Then if Black approaches in the upper right, White can get a nice combined pincer and extension.]
;B[qj]C[Here, I think P3 for Black would be more constructive. Even if White plays in the middle of the right-hand side, Black is building on a larger scale.]
;W[jc];B[qm];W[oq]C[I think this last exchange favours White.]
;B[mq];W[qh];B[rh]LB[oj:A]C[It's normally better to jump into the centre than to grub around on the second line. A would strengthen Black's group nicely, and aim into White's upper-right framework.]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[oo]C[I think this is a good move - if Black plays around here, White would have to fight to avoid being shut in. But it doesn't have much effect on Black's groups, which are low and strong.]
;B[om]C[I think this is slow. Both Black and White are strong around here, but neither is building a framework in this part of the board. That normally means neither player should be playing around here for a while.]
;W[gc]C[This is bigger than Black's last move, I think.];B[bf]
TR[cg][cj]C[I'm not sure about this move. White is building a framework across the top, so if you want to strengthen these stones, jumping out is better, as it will contest that framework. There will be time to attack White's marked group later, and if you are strong in the centre, you can attack more aggressively than this.]
;W[bg];B[cf];W[cq]TR[bf][cf][cg][bg]LB[dg:A][df:B]C[It's unusual to leave a shape like the one I've marked unfinished. Normally, you'd want to carry on at A or B. Now your group can be strongly attacked. But your corner invasion is very big, too.]
;B[dq]C[Good!];W[cp];B[do];W[bo];B[cn];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]
;W[co]C[This is a bad move. White is alive without it, and the cut doesn't work (see variation).]

(;B[em]C[Black has gained something here. But I think you can do better by attacking White's group on the left.

The aim of the attack would be to gain strength in the centre. This would be useful both to expand your framework at the bottom, and to reduce (or support an invasion of) White's upper framework.]
;W[ej]C[Good.]
(;B[fk]C[White's group is a bit too strong to be severely attacked now. I'd be looking at N6. (see variations)]
;W[df];B[de];W[eg];B[gi]
(;W[fe]C[This would normally be one point to the left. Black can cut the left-hand group off quite cleanly now.]

(;B[gg]C[Better to play E14 and cut, I think. If White connects, now, G13 turns into a smallish endgame move - N6 is much bigger.]
;W[je]C[This is big, but I think E15 and N5 are bigger.];B[jg]
;W[oh];B[lf];W[le];B[mn]C[Good! If White had played here in any of the last few moves, your wall to the left and above would be largely wasted.

The M14-M15 exchange is a loss for you, though - you don't normally want to play somewhere else, when single stones of opposite colours are touching like that.]
;W[mh]C[Good. Black's framework is bigger than yours, so it's more productive to push into it, than to defend your own.]
;B[lh]C[Probably better to give way around M10.];W[mf];B[lg]
;W[mg];B[rp]C[B: Huge mistake on my part. I should have continued with the "go stones walking" and played around M10. Correct?

If S4 is just endgame, it's too small, correct. But it it's an attempt to kill the corner, it's big enough to play.
White certainly has to answer this move.];W[rq]C[Black can consider leaving this exchange, as it's been answered on the inside.]
;B[ro];W[li]TR[jg][lh][lg][lf]C[w: I was relieved to get the chance to invade the huge  moyo I'd foolishly let black form
B: So what ought I to have done , at this point, to reduce the damage from this invasion?

White's just ignored a move in the corner, so your first thought should be to try to take your profit there.

In the centre, you should realise that the marked stones aren't as valuable as the framework below. If White spends time capturing them, you should be able to seal off a large territory. You don't need to keep the whole framework to win, by any means. Maybe M9.]
;B[ki];W[mj];B[ll]C[B: Again, a mistake. I should have played L10?

L10 is big, but I think M8 is good.];W[kj]C[Good.];B[ji];W[jk]
C[This is very big (I think it's the best move locally), but you need to be confident that the lower-right corner is safe before you play it.]
;B[il]C[Again, I think you need to hold back a bit more. Maybe one point lower.]
;W[jl];B[lk];W[lj];B[jj];W[kk];B[kn];W[jm];B[jn];W[im];B[in]
;W[hl];B[ik]TR[gi][gg][jg][ji][jj][ki][lh][lg][lf]C[Saving the one stone isn't really important. You need to worry about the whole marked group.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[gm];B[hn];W[hm];B[fn];W[pj];B[rr]C[Good. You need something here to justify the extra move you've spent, and this is a good start. In fact, I don't think Black can kill the corner wherever he starts, but I'd certainly give it a try if I were playing.]

(;W[sq]C[w: I didn't think that black should be able to get away  with his previous move. Hence I cut off the stone.  Should I have played the hane to make a tiger's mouth  and eye space?

Looks like you might die that way (see variation). You played well here.]

(;B[qr]C[This is a good try. R3 is often a good move in this shape, but here it lets White live (see variation).]
;W[qq];B[or]C[Yes, I think this is Black's best try.];W[nr]
C[Good.];B[pq]C[Best try.];W[pp];B[pr];W[nq]C[Yes. This kills Black.]
;B[sr]
(;W[mp]C[w: now that black is alive in the corner, I am worried  about my group. I'm not sure that this was the best  way to help it, though
B: We are right in thinking that black was alive, right? If white had played R1 instead of N4, for example, I'd have played O1 and then either lived small or connected with N3.

Alas, no. White can play P1.

But if Black was alive, I think N4 is as good a try as any.]
;B[os]C[B:In hindsight, this was a pretty cowardly move. I should have played M3, perhaps?

P1 is good, as Black is now alive. But yes, if Black had already been alive, M3 would be right - I can't see how White could make two eyes after that.]
;W[lq]C[w: sigh of relief];B[kq];W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[jr];W[no]
C[Good! This makes sure of life.];B[pk]C[Black hasn't gained anything from the extra move he spent in the bottom-right corner. In fact,he may even have lost points.]
;W[qi];B[rk];W[oj]LB[fb:A]TR[gg][gi][il][ik][ij][jj][ji][ki]
[jg][lf][lg][lh][bg][cg][df][eg][ej][cj]C[This is very small. For end-game, A is very big. You should also see that both of the marked groups can be cut off. White is winning, so it's probably more important to make your group absolutely safe, and think about making profit from Black's later on.]
;B[nk]C[Also small.];W[nj];B[ok];W[bm]C[w: this move looked clever somehow, but isn't.  Better  to play at the head of the two black stones?

Probably better at B9. The corner group isn't going to make any territory; the group above might. And if Black plays around B9, you'll have to spend a move connecting your group or it will die.]
;B[bn];W[bl]C[Good, this helps the upper group. But your corner is weaker.]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[dk];W[dj];B[ef]C[Too late.];W[dg];B[ff];W[ee]
;B[ed];W[ge];B[hd]LB[fj:A][gj:B]C[This is an interesting idea, but don't forget that White can cut your group off at A or B. It has enough space to make two eyes at the moment, but you'll have to be careful as the endgame gets played out.]
;W[he];B[gb];W[hb];B[fb];W[hc];B[me];W[ne]
(;B[ke]C[B: Looks like I should have extended to N16?

I think L15 is best here. If you play N16, White can play L15, and your stones are cut off with nothing to attack.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[jf];W[jd];B[kf]C[Too small, as you have no threats even with the cutting points you create.]
;W[md]C[Unnecessary. Black's stone had nowhere to go.];B[if]
C[Too cautious - you've made nice eyeshape for your group now.]
;W[el];B[dm];W[ek];B[fl];W[gj];B[fm];W[fj];B[fi];W[ei];B[am]
;W[al];B[an];W[bj]C[This is unnecessary - the stones on the edge can't be caught, and your left-hand group is safely connected to your top group, so there's no worry about eyes.

However, you do need to worry about your corner once Black has played A6. In general, when the liberties begin to disappear for a group shut in to the corner like that, you have to be careful that it can't be killed. Here, I think Black can get a ko to kill it, if you don't defend.]

(;B[lm]C[This is a bit small. T13 is big, and it's sente. H19 is also sente for you.]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[fc];B[eb]C[Not necessary.];W[ao]C[Good, the group is safe now.]
;B[rf]C[Should be T13]
(;W[qf]C[You can afford to cut this off (see variation).];B[sg]
;W[qg];B[re];W[rd];B[sf];W[pd]C[w: I played far too cautiously in defending this corner, I  think. I could have played elsewhere and gained a  point or two

Yes.];B[ks]C[B: In retrospect, this move seems weak. A better way? I played a very passive endgame, which, ultimately, may have cost me the game, or at least a much closer outcome. Any insight into improving my endgame here would be appreciated.

M2 is bigger here, and it's sente. I don't think there's anything too bad about your endgame.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[po];B[qn];W[fg];B[gf];W[hf]C[W: Should have played 3 points below this, I now think]
;B[ie]C[Too greedy. Your group is cut off, so you must make sure of two eyes before anything else.]

(;W[id]LB[ih:A]TR[ef][ff][gf][gg][gi][fi]C[White should attack at J12 (see variation). This will kill all Black's stones.

It's hard to see a move like this during a game, but the exact move isn't so important. When you played H14, Black ignored you, so you should look for a way to punish him for it. H11, H12, and H13 are all painful for Black. Even if he does save his group, you have good chances to capture one or both of the marked sets of stones. Each of those is worth more than the one stone which Black is threatening to save with J15 (it isn't a cutting stone).]
;B[hg];W[fh];B[gh];W[gn];B[go];W[af];B[ae];W[ag];B[bd];W[hj]
;B[hi];W[ga];B[fa];W[ha];B[ls];W[mr];B[rc]LB[sd:A]C[B: This was simply foolhardy. There are lots of better positions in which I could have taken profit. A waste of sente.

Yes, T16 is best here.];W[sd];B[qb]C[White can ignore this, but if you know you're winning so there's no harm in answering. Had you counted?]
;W[pb];B[sc]C[White can ignore this.];W[qc];B[sh]C[White can certainly ignore this!]
