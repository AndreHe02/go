AB[pd][dp][dd]C[Dear Matthias,

I have reviewed your game.

General comment: I like your style of play very much. If you
pay a bit more attention to cutting points, I think you will
definitely go up a couple of grades. Cutting points are incredibly
bad aji, so try not to leave too many of them behind, and look
closely at the position when your opponent does.

Just my 2 cents.

Hope you enjoy the review.

Best wishes,
Thorstein];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn];B[jp];W[cf];B[dh];W[ef];B[fd];W[bd]
;B[cc];W[bh];B[jc]C[** Fine fuseki so far, I think.];W[cn]LB[qf:A]
C[** I would play at R14 -- the left side does not seem too big.]
;B[cl]LB[dn:A][fp:B]C[** For the same reason I would not play the pincer here. D6 or F4 perhaps?]
;W[en];B[fp];W[dk]C[** Nice move -- pushing at C9 does not seem so appealing for black.]
;B[dl]LB[cq:A]CR[cn][en]C[** Good, tough attitude! The only problem with this way of playing is
that the corner is open at C3, so in a way C6 and E6 are light.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[ck]LB[bk:A][bl:B]C[** It seems white can answer B9 by B8, so this is not
working well for black.];B[em];W[fl];B[dm];W[fm]C[sita: Not very satifactory. e9 was to hard?

** Maybe pushing along would have been better after all.];B[dn]
;W[bl];B[eo];W[fn]C[** Awful result for black. Still white is overconcentrated on the left.]
;B[qj];W[hp]C[** This is too narrow, and in a bad relation to the stones above.
On the plus side, the black corner group is still not settled --
this was probably what white was considering.];B[hq]LB[go:A]
CR[el][fl][fm][fn][en]C[sita: I wanted to gain some power against the f7 group. But I was not very successful.

** G5 looks like the move -- that also has a negative effect on the F7 group.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[gq];B[ho];W[gp];B[go];W[hr];B[fr]LB[fo:A][io:B]
C[** This way of playing is maybe not out of the question for black,
but white is getting life too easily. Also black should be worrying
more about his cutting points -- if white can play F5 in sente J5
becomes a dangerous cut.];W[fq]LB[fo:A]C[** Now F5 will be sente.]
;B[eq]LB[er:A]C[** Wouldn't E2 put more pressure on white?]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[gr]
(;B[kr]LB[kq:A][jn:B]C[** The right idea, not just playing K3 - K2. But after white K3 black
L3 black has too many cutting points. L3 is a better point here, I
think. Or just K6.
Alternatively one might play something like B9, aiming at securing
the corner territory (see variations).];W[er];B[dr];W[fs];B[co]
;W[cm];B[do];W[bo]
(;B[bn]LB[bp:A][bk:B]C[** Better just to play B4. If white ignores that black can follow up
with B9.];W[bm];B[bp];W[an];B[fk]LB[cq:A]C[sita: I thought something like: 'Now I have to use the power' (I did not build :( )

** Ok, but the corner group has become short of liberties. After C3 it goes
quickly!];W[hl];B[gk];W[hm];B[cq]C[** Good.];W[jq];B[kq]LB[kp:A]
[io:B]C[** L4 is better, even cutting at J5 is ok for white.]
;W[kp]C[** But white looks at the big picture ...];B[in];W[lp]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[km];W[hk];B[hj];W[ij];B[ik]C[** This is an overplay. Black now has two cutting points above, and a
weak group below.];W[jl];B[jk];W[jm];B[jn];W[kl];B[lm];W[mn]
;B[mm];W[nn];B[kk];W[ll];B[mj]C[sita: I thought I could capture the whole group...

** There are too many cutting points in the black position. I would not
be very worried as white.];W[hi];B[gj];W[ii];B[ml]LB[lj:A]C[** Must be at M10.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[mk];B[nk];W[kj];B[jj];W[ki]C[sita: ... But I did not see this move.

** Black has lost here.];B[gi];W[gh];B[fh];W[gg];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[ei]LB[eg:A][eh:B][ch:C][fj:D]C[** Note that white still has a ko to kill.]
;W[nj]LB[nl:A][pk:B]C[** Or O8 or Q9.];B[ok];W[or];B[om]C[** Good.]
;W[on];B[ni];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[lc];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[kf];B[ie];W[hc]C[** No reason to play this.]
;B[id];W[qc];B[ob]LB[kg:A][jf:B][jh:C]C[sita: He cannot live in all three places.

** White is relying on connecting the M14 group to the other
white stones -- black L13, white K14 etc. He must have over-
looked the peep at K12.];W[re];B[rg];W[qg];B[qf];W[rf];B[rh]
;W[qd]LB[ra:A][od:B]C[** Black should be suspicious about this move since it doesn't
secure life (black S19 kills). The real meaing is to threaten P16.]
;B[jh]C[** Very good play.];W[ji];B[ig];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[kc]
;W[jg];B[jf]LB[ih:A][hh:B]C[** Maybe better just to connect at J12? A factor to take into
account is that the white group below is dead after a cut at
H12 (but the ko to kill the black group on the left still remains).]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[mi];B[lh];W[li];B[oi]LB[ih:A][ng:B]C[** Better to protect one of the cutting points.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[og];B[of]C[
guest299  NR : Starting observation.];W[pe]C[sita: Argh!];B[od]
C[
goman  2d : Starting observation.];W[oe];B[ne];W[ih];B[mh];W[qe]
;B[me];W[ld]LB[oj:A]C[** Better to keep this exchange in reserve, keeping the aji at P10.]
;B[le];W[lb];B[ka];W[nb];B[pq]LB[mp:A]C[sita: Probably a last chance?

** Looks difficult.
