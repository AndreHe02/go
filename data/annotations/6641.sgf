C[Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I (1k) was playing white against a stronger player (2d).

It was a short, fighty game. There have been a few big exchanges i'm very unsure about. Also, i felt like i often helped my opponent. Please point out my mistakes.

[kb\]: Hi Sebastian, my name's Kyle, nice to meet you.  This was a very interesting game - I hope that you can see some reasoning from it.]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[dq];W[cd];B[dn];W[nq]C[Good choice.];B[pf];W[fc]
TR[pf][dn]C[[kb\]: Keep in mind at this point Black must use his high stones to his advantage now.  Otherwise, territorially you will be ahead, so it is to your advantage to keep the game simple and not let Black develop big spaces.]
;B[ic]
(;W[pb]C[[kb\]: My feeling is that this probe is a little too early.  Since Black has already played high enclosures, he is very likely going to play for the outside; this, then, has little use as a 'probe', since you already know how Black is going to answer.

Keep the game simple, like playing at C8.];B[oc];W[qh];B[qc]
C[[kb\]: Now because Black is so strong in the upper right it is urgent to defend on the right side, but then Black will get C14.]
;W[pk];B[cf]C[[kb\]: Painful!]
(;W[ch]LB[ed:B][ee:A][fe:C]C[Is this an overplay?

[kb\]: Yes, it is - especially after Black's moves in the upper right.  Probably better to simply reinforce the corner with A, B, or C.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eh]
(;W[ei]TR[fc][cd]C[[kb\]: You had better cut.  Playing like this lets the top stones come under attack too easily.

Also, you can't expect to get everything here.  You do have neighboring stones, but Black got to play first in this area.]
;B[fh]
(;W[fi]C[White is pushing from behind. Is this bad?

[kb\]: Yes, just make shape here.];B[gh]C[[kb\]: Now the cut at E13 isn't really a threat, and it isn't clear F11 is helping White at all on the left side.]
;W[cl];B[dc];W[dd];B[ec];W[ed];B[fb];W[gb]C[With J17 present, is this an overplay?

[kb\]: You have no choice.];B[gc];W[fd];B[eb];W[hc];B[gd]
(;W[ge]C[[kb\]: You cannot play this way very easily.];B[hd]
;W[he];B[id];W[ef]C[[kb\]:];B[eg]
(;W[ie]C[[kb\]: Yes, you must get your dragon out.];B[gi];W[gj]
TR[di][fj]C[[kb\]: This leaves major weaknesses behind here.  Better to not play here at all then to play G10.]
;B[fj]C[[kb\]: Ouch.];W[gk];B[ej];W[di];B[el];W[ek];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[fk]
(;W[ck]C[[kb\]: Play at F8 first];B[gl]
(;W[ik];B[bh];W[bi];B[cg];W[ci];B[ag]C[[kb\]: This is the wrong direction for Black - it's better to keep running.  Splitting two groups with one is always a sure-win strategy.]
;W[bn];B[ij]
(;W[hk]C[[kb\]: H8 is sente!];B[jh];W[je];B[kd];W[ke];B[ld]
;W[le];B[lh];W[jd];B[md];W[hb];B[jc];W[kc]C[[kb\]: Good combination.]

;B[ca];W[ac];B[ea];W[aa];B[ga]C[[kb\]: Nice, this is a good ko for White.  You have made your outside dragon almost alive and you might get a whole bunch of stones in the process.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[fa];B[bm]C[[kb\]: You must respond to this ko threat.  You still have a bunch of large ones.]

(;W[da];B[cm];W[cn]C[I wanted to use the dead group right away to attack the D3 stone, but i totally misread the sequence.

Is it better for white to play around K4 and try to win by a small amount?]
;B[dm];W[do];B[cp]C[I did not see this obvious move.];W[dp]
;B[cq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[co]C[[kb\]: Coming back here to connect is slow and heavy - don't do it.]

Thank you again for reviewing this game!])
(;W[gp]C[Is this move possible?

[kb\]: Yes, something here is possible.]
(;B[ep];W[eo]C[I think white is out here.])
(;B[fp];W[gn];B[eo];W[ho];B[ep]C[Is this sente exchange enough for white to win in yose?

[kb\]: No, Black is far ahead on the board now.];W[oo]C[[kb\]: Black has 60 points on the left side and 30+ points on the top right.  White has about 25 at the top left, so he needs 60 points from the right side to win.  I don't think this is possible.]
