C[Hi!

I'm Saurus, 3 kyu on KGS.

I have reviewed this game for the black side.

I will mark all my comments with [Saurus\]. Wherever I have offered variations on a move, I have marked [SEE VARIATION\] in my comments.

The way I have reviewed this game is from my understanding as a 3k. Perhaps a stronger player may review differently, but I have merely commented according to my understanding of the game.

Sometimes some of my comments may seem harsh. I apologize if I occasionally come accross as very harsh. This is just my style of reviewing, and no disrespect is intended.

I have commented in detail on the subtleties of most moves, where the move was not obvious, and I have offered variations where appropriate.

I have also given a summary of key concepts that you need to focus on at the end of the game.

I really enjoyed reviewing the game, and hope that you will improve as a result of my input.

Regards
Mark

[mq][mr][ms][mk][nk][ok][pk][qk][rk][sk][sg][rg][qg][pg][og]
[hd][ie][ke][je][le][mf][nf][gd][eb][da]C[[Saurus\] The direction of this move is not ideal. Shimaris (corner enclosures) have directions or spheres of influence which they control, and it is important to take these into consideration when choosing where to play. I have explained the reasons for the direction of play below.

First, let me point out some good moves, and why they are good...

The p3 and r4 stones already exert considerable influence along the right side of the board. A play at (A) would make the area surrounded by squares almost un-invadable. Furthermore, it is sente, as white must then protect r10 at r13, so this HUGE moyo is achieved in sente. This is extremely good for black.

(B) completes a shimari and exerts a lot of influence along the top (see outline of marked area). The idea would then be to follow up by approaching white's d16, thereby taking control of the top. White cannot play close to the q17 stone, because of the proverb "Play away from thickness", so the furthest he can safely extend is at k17. This gives black another sente play similar to (A) at m17.

(C) is also playable. The idea is that after w-c14, black pulls back at k16, securing his control of the top.

[SEE VARIATIONS\]

Now, why b-f3 is bad:

D4 is strong and cannot be killed. It radiates white influence in a circle around itself.  B-f3 is played right in white's sphere of influence. What happens when you play in your opponent's sphere of influence? He will attack your stone, and chase it around the board, making territory as he goes along. Such plays should be reserved for invasions or reductions only, and even then, should only be played on the last possible turn before your opponent converts his moyo to territory. Playing in your opponents sphere of territory this early without backup is asking for trouble. However, if black already had backup at k4, then b-f3 is a good move, because both black and white share the influence around f3, and it can't be considered to be white's sphere. As it stands, black can expect to be chased around the board now by a white pincer.

But you may ask, why is (C) in white's sphere of inluence while f3 is not? The reason is because of the direction in which black's shimaris are facing. Once black has played (B), his influence reaches right across the top, so that any white pincer around h17 after black (C) would be in black's spere, favouring black. This is why white would probably not play a pincer after black (C). On the other hand, the bottom right shimari exerts no influence along the bottom. It's influence is in the area marked by the square border. Thus, only white has influence along the bottom.

Lastly, a black play at (D) is theoretically acceptable too, because it is far enough to be outside of the range of d16 and d4. It is a huge play by black, but unfortunately it gives white sente. Black should strive to get this point, but it should be played AFTER black's sente sequences at (A) or (B). The only way white can get this point is if black plays (B) and white concedes the top. Then w-d10, b-f17, w-d14, b-k16, and black has almost turned the entire top into territory.]
;W[iq]C[[Saurus\] As expected!];B[dr]C[[Saurus\] Noooooo!!!!!!!!

This move allows white to secure his corner unconditionally with w-c3, thereby allowing him to attack black with great force. Now white's corner attacking black's group will be like a giant chasing a gnat!

Black had to play b-c3 immediately, or jump to b-f5. This way, there is still aji in the corner, and white still has to be cautious while attacking.]

[co][cn][bn][an][jr][kr][lr][ir][is][js][ks][ls][cm][bm][am]
C[[Saurus\] White has made considerable territory from the last few moves (marked) while black's group has made none, and is still on the run. This is typical of playing in the opponent's sphere of influence.]
(;B[mp]LB[ql:A]TR[mq][nq][nr][mr][ms][ns]C[[Saurus\] This (the marked triangles) is not territory. White simply has to play w-r7 at some stage to completely cancel any benefit this move has made. Furthermore, it's a contact move, which should be used for defense. the problem is, after w-m4, black has to respond with b-n5, taking gote and allowing white to play w-r7. 

You may ask: Can't black plays r8 after w-m4?
He can, but then n5 has achieved nothing except strengthening white. It would have been a hundred times better if it had been left out.

B-r8 (A) was the only move here.];W[lp];B[lo]C[[Saurus\] B-m17 leaves a nasty cutting point at n5, which you will have to protect in gote. Far better to keep sente with b-n5.]
;W[ko]
(;B[mn]C[[Saurus\] See...

Now consider the board without the m5/L5 exchange. It's basically the same, except that then black had sente. Now white does.

In essence, you the exchange gave away sente for free.

Even having played m5, your follow-up could have been better...

Better than b-n6 would have been to double hane, since white is still weak enough to have to defend, then, although you still lose sente, you at least make some profit.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[ln];B[mo];W[kn]
(;B[qe]C[[Saurus\] Nooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't ever leave the scene of a fight to tenuki until the area is settled.

See the comment after white's next move to see why, and then come back ato this move to look at the variation here...

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[qm]C[[Saurus\] Look at the three stones at n5. What have they achieved?

Territory? No

Attacking white? No, they have strengthened white and allowed him to escape.

Influence? No, because r7/r10 is alive. Thus, they can't even be considered thickness.

They have done NOTHING except to help white.

The only possible way to make them count would have been by making substantial solid territory in the corner with b-r8 on the last move.

B-r8 was the ONLY option.];B[fc]C[[Saurus\] Good! 

This is the right direction from the top right shimari.];W[ic]
(;B[mc]LB[kc:A]C[[Saurus\] Too timid! This is your sphere of influence. Fight hard and make him hurt for doing playing in your moyo.

Black is strong on top, so can easily play b-L17 (A).

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[cg];B[cc];W[cd]C[[Saurus\] White sould have played at d17, making you live small in the corner in gote. You were lucky.]
;B[dc];W[ed]
(;B[bd]MA[cj]C[[Saurus\] This is a strategic blunder. You will  have to invade or reduce the left at some stage. The sequence over the next few moves seriously strengthens white on the left.

It would have been better to simply live with b-f18. You may have to live small in gote later, but at least the left still has some weaknesses, making an invasion possible.

On the other hand, if you had no intention of ever invading/reducing the left, the sequence you played here is better.

It is important to know the standard move b-f18, and when to play it, and also when b-b16 is better.

For example, if white had a marked stone at X, then b16 would have been correct, since white strengthening the left doesn't matter, since you couldn't have invaded ther anyway.

But without white X, b-f18 now is better, so that white can't strengthen the left withou taking gote.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[be];B[bc];W[dj]C[[Saurus\] The exchange allowed white to secure the side. Also now, without f18, b-g15 is not nearly as good, since it can be cut in sente. with b-f18 in place, white's cut would not help him at all with the j17 stone.]
;B[dl]LB[ge:A][qh:B][kc:C]C[[Saurus\] This reduction is way too early, while there are still undecided areas on the board. Remember, a reduction will ALWAYS have bad consequences, and should only be used to reduce the opponent's territory once there is no othe option. Here, plays such as A, B and C are much bigger, and won't end up with you having to deal with a hanging group.

Very important: Don't invade /reduce too early!!!];W[cl];B[ck]
C[I think i did something wrong here.

[Saurus\] This move was OK. However, in the following moves, there were two vital rules which you broke, resulting in catastrophe - see the comments and variations in the next few moves.]
;W[dk];B[cm]C[[Saurus\] Still OK...];W[bl];B[dm]C[[Saurus\] Still fine...]
;W[bk]
(;B[co]C[[Saurus\] Serious blunder!

The following rule is like a commandment in Go. It cannot under any circumstances be broken without dire consequences...

Rule: You should not, may not, CAN NOT, attack a group when you have two weak groups, one on either side, of the group you are attacking. It will NEVER succeed.

Watch what will happen, even with the best possible play over the next few moves...

You should have strengthened your groups here. White then MUST protect the corner, or you will kill the corner. You then get sente to play at g15, putting you firmly ahead in the game.
The moment you allow yourself to get separated, you will lose one of the two groups.

Here, you should simply have connected and strengthened your groups with b-e6.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[do]
(;B[bq]C[[Saurus\] Local blunder number 2:

As we have seen from the previous rule, you cannot attack the white group yet. However, assume that both black groups were connected, and were not weak. Locally, then you could have killed the white group, but not the way you tried, because you broken another well known rule (one which I am sure you have heard many times):

DON'T  USE CONTACT MOVES FOR ATTACK.

Doesn't matter how many times people hear this, they still do it (I myself are guilty of this sometimes - it's like an irresistable force compelling us to make contact when attacking).

Consider the alternative...

Simply connect at b-c6.

[SEE VARIATIONS\]

(Make sure also to follow the line where white plays w-e6, to demonstrate the danger in this position)]
;W[cr]LB[en:A];B[cp]C[[Saurus\] You still need to get your groups to safety first.]

;W[go];B[hl];W[gq];B[fo];W[ep];B[go];W[hq]C[[Saurus\] It had to happen. You attacked with two weak groups. One of them had to die.]
;B[el];W[br];B[ap]SQ[bp][bo][ao][an][bn][bm][am]C[[Saurus\] This is the type of reflex move that prevents progress.

You certainly don't need an eye, because the group is well out in the center, and is strong there.

The marked area is open from both sides. You cannot make any territory there because white can simply w-a6 if he wants to.

Therefore, b-a4 simply saves one stone! To make matters worse, you save that stone in GOTE!!!!

If you want to improve, you CANNOT play reflex moves like these.

What about the huge moves on the board such as g15 and r12?]
;W[qg]C[[Saurus\] You should be close to tears now.]
(;B[pg]TR[of][pf][ne][nd][od][oe][pe][pd]C[[Saurus\] Hmmm... What is you goal here?

The marked squares look like a lot of work for little territory.

You should always make territory by attacking!

Don't try and make territory by placing stones (Q13 cannot be considered as an attacking move, because it is a contact move). Placing stones to claim territory are always gote. White could simply play w-O14 here if he wanted to foil your plan of making territory in the marked area. Don't give white the chance. Rather attack him, and make territory that way.

Follow the variation to see a better way of trying to make territory here, if that was your goal...

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[ph]
(;B[oh]C[[Saurus\] You cannot respond to a hane this way.

You should always respond to a hane with either a nobi (solid extension, and usually best) or cross-cut (in some circumstances) .

;B[pi];W[qh];B[pj];W[qk];B[pk];W[pl];B[qi]C[[Saurus\] Why push here? You know white is going to respond with s11, and you have no further plays below white's third line. All it does is remove one of YOUR liberties.

White says thank you very much, and you limp away, having shot your three Q10 stones in the foot.]
;W[ri];B[ol]LB[nj:A]C[[Saurus\] Bad shape. Rather play (A) to make your group extremely strong.]
;W[om];B[pn];W[ok]C[[Saurus\] Wouldn't it be nice to have that extra liberty at r11 now?]

(;B[oe]C[[Saurus\] 

There is a Proverb: "Even a fool connects against a peep." (http://senseis.xmp.net/?EvenAMoronConnectsAgainstAPeep)

What you have just done here is created a peep, where white has already played q14, which white can push straight through, cutting your p12 group off from the rest! It's even worse than not connecting the peep!

B-O15 was the correct way to defend.

;B[gd];W[fg];B[no]C[I have summarized here the most important concepts that I feel you need to focus on, in order of priority. The first two points are by far the most important concepual changes you need to work on urgently, but the rest will be equally important as you improve.

1. Delay playing in your opponent's sphere of influence for as long as possible. Invading/reducing too early is a guarantee of loss. Concentrate on making your own territory, before trying to destroy your opponent's territory , while you still have very little. Remember, that once you invade, you will be chased around, and if this is too early, your opponent will end up making much more territory than you destroyed simply by chasing you around the board.

2. Don't make two weak groups! Don't EVER consider attacking anything until you have stabilized (made alive or connecting) at least one of your weak groups. If you have two weak groups, stabilizing one of them is more important than any other move on the board.

NB: Points 1 and 2 are vital to your improvement, and these two points alone ultimately cost you this game. Fix these, and you'll improve dramatically, at least by a few stones.


3. Don't touch when attacking! You will never kill a group or even profit from it if you touch it, unless it is purely for self defense.

4. If you have invested a few stones into making territory, do not tenuki until you have secured that territory, or all your stones will have been wasted.

5. Don't leave dangerous cutting points. Hane is good, but only where you are strong and don't mind being cut. In other words, if you are already alive on both sides of the cut, then hane. Otherwise, nobi (solid extension) is usually better.

6. Concentrate on the direction of play in the opening. It is important to understand why some approaches are good and others are bad. I have tried as far as possible to detail these during the opening in this game.

7. Lastly, avoid reflex moves and small moves. Force youself to look around on every move for just a second or two before replying to a move. This way, you'll end up with 20-odd extra points in the game. And if you think about it, 20 points is worth two stones rank.
