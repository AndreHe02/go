AB[pd][dp]C[jd: I'm adding some comments as I go
back through the game, and I'll do them like I do here, as jd:

jd: This was a really interesting game to me. The overall shape of the
territories was unusual. I succeeded in connecting through the middle,
which is an area I'm usually weak in. And I feel like neither player fell
into the trap of playing a lot of small moves. But there were definitely
some things I could have done better, and I have some questions. Thanks
very much to whoever reviews this game!

I put in a lot of questions, but I'm also VERY interested in your insight
into the things I don't even know enough to ask, if you see what I mean
:)];W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[oq]C[this is not correct here...it just makes W stronger and settled...this move is appropriate if B has a stone at k3 or k4. In that case, after W o4 B q6, W cannot make an efficient extension from the 2 stones...]
;W[np]C[jd: I see this sequence a lot (2
- 5), it seems very normal...];B[pg]C[no, B must play q6...now W has the strong move at q5]
;W[pj]C[q5 is the move here.

All this does is let B correct his earlier omission AND make the q10 stone weak...]
;B[jc]C[jd: I didn't want to get
any closer, like L17 or M17, because I felt like I'd be too squished and
not moving big enough. Is this correct?

lr: for one thing the corner is still open, and either wall built by B after  a W r17 invasion would be inefficient.

Also, q6 is urgent and double meaning here....defense and attack...it doesn't get any better than that :))))]
;W[nc];B[ne]C[now the p17 move would be appropriate for the reasons stated earlier...protect the corner and make W cramped....because of the k17 stone]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[od];B[oe];W[lc];B[ke];W[kd];B[jd]C[jd: I feel pretty
good about this sequence. Were there errors?

given  the o15 move, these seem to be good moves....you want to seal W in....these stones are out of the game then, and you can use your strength to attack elsewhere]
;W[le];B[lf];W[me];B[mf];W[nd];B[kc];W[ld];B[pb]C[great forcing move!]
;W[oc]C[jd: I thought now that he
was definitely alive, so I went elsewhere. But now I wonder whether, if I'd
played K14 first, I could have gone in and killed.

lr: you certainly have some forcing moves against him here...p18 and then m18]
;B[fd]C[you should avoid playing close to strength, either yours or your opponent's...and you just have 3 lines of territory here between your f16 stone and your k16 stones...not enough profit for this strength...better is to attack from the other side at c14....then the left side is very developable for you...strength in one place does not necessarily mean terrtory in that same area....the strength can be used to make territory somewhere else...like the left side]
;W[cg];B[ff]C[jd: I'm trying to keep reaching toward the
middle...

lr: why?  there are very big points elsewhere...q6 is still urgent, the W q10 stone looks lonely, and there are large empty areas on the left side and the bottom side]
;W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[gb];W[cn]C[look at what B has now...not enough considering the early part of the game


...still a play by White at q5 is the most urgent move on the board]
;B[en]C[f3 is proper here];W[do];B[eo];W[dj];B[ob]C[jd: Now I suddenly thought maybe I could kill after all, but I
didn't play K14. or R15 as protection.];W[nb]C[jd: Now I thought that a
move at R18 would require me to defend at S18, and then white R16 would be
double atari. So I went back, late, to
protect.];B[qd]C[yes, this happens all the time at your level...the key is reading...play ahead a few moves in your head...then you will see tha this move is gote and you will not make it :)))]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[ka];B[ja];W[mb];B[la];W[lb];B[jf];W[jp];B[gq]
C[jd: Would another move in this area be better? H3,
maybe, or H4? I have a lot of trouble judging exactly where to put attempts
at big moves.

lr: this threatens k2....];W[hq];B[go]C[no, g4 is standard in this shape]
;W[ho];B[hn]C[Bh4, Wj4, Bg4 is better];W[io];B[co]C[big move...nice]
;W[dn];B[in]C[no, you left the corner too soon...b4 or so is needed]
;W[jn];B[im]C[bad shape...empty triangle...inefficient use of 3 stones...]
;W[mn];B[pm]C[one space too far...you have to q6 to prevent Wq5]
;W[qn]C[jd: I realize now that Q6 would have
been better than Q7, is this correct?

yes];B[qo];W[pn];B[jk]C[always look to make the biggest move...that is often on the sides...b4 is very big...p2 is important since  B corner is sealed in...whenever you get sealed in, alarm bells should go ff concerning the safety of the group]
;W[om]C[jd: I'm
willing to abandon Q8.];B[pi]C[r11 better, or s12...i'm not sure]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[qk];B[ri];W[qj];B[oi];W[oj];B[nj]C[good ...moves like this make your opponent's terr. smaller and yours bigger...big moves]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[em]C[e7 was big for you too for the same reason as in the last comment]
;B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[gk]C[jd: I'd like to
know whether there's any way to have played this sequence better...I feel
like I'm often forced into this series of moves...


reducing from the other side sooner may have been better...something like e12]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi];B[hi];W[fi];B[lm]C[jd: Is M7 too
strong?];W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[jl];W[ll];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[nl]
;B[kk]C[jd: Seems now like N7 slightly
better than L9...];W[ln];B[kn];W[jo];B[rn];W[po];B[qp];W[op]
;B[or];W[nr];B[ns];W[rm];B[sn]C[n2 would have been bigger];W[ms]
;B[os];W[lr];B[sm];W[rl];B[pl];W[ok];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl]
;B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[bp];W[sl];B[rp];W[rj];B[si];W[sj]
;B[rg];W[ko];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hp];W[ip];B[gp];W[ef]
;B[ee];W[de];B[ed]C[jd: It seems like E16 is the crucial wrong move :(
This next sequence was pretty upsetting.

yes,....again, try to visualize the position after your move before you actually make it, and these things will happen less frequently....tha alrm bell here that should go off is those 2 ataris]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[fe]C[jd: What
should I have done here? I felt very trapped.];B[ge]C[put  the g15 move at h15 and you will be ok]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[hg];B[ge];W[hh];B[ih];W[ig];B[jg]

C[jd: Silly move, it seems now. I
didn't take D10 into account.];W[aj];B[ai];W[ci];B[bg];W[bh]

any point at which I could have made this group live?

black's part. I never saw it coming :P];B[sq]C[again, that tactical reading stuff wil come with time....keep working at it!!!]

again to whoever reviews this! The more you have to say, the happier I am
:)

lr:  you're welcome...i hope it helps!
