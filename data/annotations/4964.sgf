C[hello reviewer :)
i chose this game for reviewing because although i understood what my opponent was doing (or trying to do) at each stage, i lost by alot of points.
I think my biggest problem is the opening part.
i tried to make as much comments and ask as much questions about my moves as possible. if you answer them please leave the original question on so i'll know what are you answering.

thanks, noam

 hi, i am your reviewer, odif, I will precede all my comments with Odif:
I hope my review helps, if you wish to contact me,
robprentice67@yahoo.co.uk];B[pd];W[dp]LB[co:B][do:A][cp:C][ep:G]
[cq:D][dq:E][eq:F]C[i played a star point because i thought if i'll play a 3-4 he'll respond on the weeker side, so i made a symmetrical move. right decision?

odif: black could also consider moves A toG in this corner]
;B[pp]
(;W[cd]LB[nc:A]C[i played 3-4 because i know two star points aren't good.
maybe i should have applied presure like in A?

Odif: The 2 starpoints in black's position look good to me
a move at A should follow a move in the empty corner
The stone on c 16 is in the wrong direction, the reason being, a black at e16 then uses his 2 starpoint stones to good effect.The principles of good opening development are to play first in the empty corners and then to make a corner enclosure or an extension and finally to make an approach move.]

(;B[fq]C[Odif: Should have been at E16, if white ignores, black can press at D14]
;W[cm]LB[dn:B][hq:A]C[thought about A or something areound there , but i think he would have applied pressure somewhere around B if i hadn't played c7

Odif:I think a move at B is maybe better, because othrwise white will have too low a position on the left side.
A move at b puts more pressure on F3];B[dr]
(;W[ec]LB[dj:B][hp:A]C[securing the corner... maybe it's too defensive, thought about A and B, also...

Odif:I would consider a move around N16 or Q10 maybe];B[jp]

(;W[pj]C[can't let him connect the upper right and lower right corners...

Odif: good, white could also approach at O16 or O17];B[dj]
(;W[ch]LB[cf:B][dh:A]C[too low? should have been A?

Odif: this move leaves a weakness at B after black B 10.];B[bj]
TR[cm][dp]C[Odif: The marked white stones are now in danger]

(;W[pm]LB[jc:A]C[Maybe A was bigger?

Odif: Q10 is strong, Q7 and Q13 are MIAI, a move here is non-urgent as is a move around A  White must strengthen his lower left]

(;B[qn];W[qm]LB[qg:A]C[I think this could have been better..

Odif: This is normal to strengthen your stone when your opponent plays right next to your stone, a natural move]
;B[mp]LB[qo:A]C[Odif: Too greedy,black has a weakness at A]

(;W[qq]C[Thought it's time to invade the corner, or else he'll secure it and i won't be able to take any territory out of that area...

Odif:It is too soon to enter the corner here the play here only succeeded in giving black  30+ points of territory along the bottom and weakening the R7 group. White must strengthen lower left]

;W[sr]C[this is weird. it's a shape i always end up with when i'm invading a corner, and players who are experienced as much as myself tend to think it's dead... is it not common?

Odif: It is a fairly common live shape];B[po];W[qg]LB[jc:A]
TR[rn][sn]C[still thinking i should have played A instead... what do you think?

Odif:A would be bigger than the move played];B[qe]C[very small move, no?

Odif: It is  big,];W[jc]C[finally, black was generous enough to let me make the move, though i think i should have played it much earlier...]

(;B[lc];W[hd]C[don't know if it's the right spot... is there a way to know how to connect, or you just remember the right connection for each type?

Odif: This move looks all right,maybe I would have played at K15 because after,white has the move at O17 to aim for]
;B[bh]
(;W[cg]C[so i played here instead...];B[bg];W[bf];B[be]
(;W[af]C[it should have been c15, right?

Odif: Right, see variation];B[cf];W[ce];B[df]
(;W[bd]C[i don't see a way to save c13 so i at least save a14.

Odif:there is a way];B[ag]C[Odif: too small]
(;W[ae]C[Odif:NO];B[ci]C[Odif: good move, now D12 doesn't work]

(;W[kf]C[here i thought i can either go to to the right side and press the upper right corner or to the left and gain some territory on the upper left.

Odif: This move is irrelavant, white must protect his weakest group]
;B[eh]C[Odif: a wasted move]
(;W[jj]C[i think his last move was very small... that two stones were already dead. i thought i grabbed a good chunk of the board with this move, and i still had the the two moves i thought about from my last move.

Odif:This move does nothing to black, white could try O17];B[le]

;W[pg];B[og];W[oh];B[ng];W[nh]LB[pc:B][co:C][cq:A]C[Odif : Black now has good moves at A or C followed by  B]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[kd];W[mm]C[i though that that was a small threat and there were much bigger moves to make...

Odif: Protecting D4 group is enormous now]
(;B[jn]LB[kg:D][ph:A][li:C][ni:B]C[Odif: White has left lots of cutting points in his shape which black can aim at]
;W[km]LB[fo:A]TR[cm][dp][fq][dr]SQ[hq]C[A instead? or maybe something else?

Odif:A definitely, infact A should have been played ages ago, it is the key point between these 2 groups.after A, the invasion at the squared point.]

if you see anything i could have done better please tell me...

thank you again :)
