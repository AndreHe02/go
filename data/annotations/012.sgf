TS: This is joseki, but I'm not sure how good it is. See variation B. Another possibility is 'a', with largely the same result. However, there doesn't seem that much else that can be done; White's territory is relatively large, so perhaps this isn't impossible.]

(;B[qp]L[ql]C[TS: This, as showed previously, _isn't_ joseki. Black should play 'a' and retain sente.]

C[Approaching a corner seems to be the only thing to do here, but which?


TS: The go jargon term for this is "jealous". :-) In other words, it appears that White doesn't want Black to get any territory. Any of the points from 'a' to 'e' seem better, even though 'e' is bit slow.


Perhaps I should expand a bit on that "jealous" argument. After all, isn't the one who has the most territory the winner, and therefore destroying one's opponent's territory a good strategy? Well, yes, but go is a game of continuous give and take. In particular, when you invade a moyo, your opponent will, barring any major blunder, invariably gain strength, which will probably result in him getting territory elsewhere.

In practice, this means White's strategy in handicap games is usually to destroy _power_ (high hcap games) or be careful to not give the same (low hcap ones).]

C[too slow?


TS: No. It feels slow, to be sure, but a Black play there is just too painful, to my taste.]
;B[cj];W[cq]M[mc]L[of][oh][cf][fc]C[This is gote, so maybe it is too early?


TS: It would seem so, yes. I would be tempted to try to establish a presence on the right, but it's horribly deep. 'a' or 'b' come to mind.

Other possibilities: 'c' or 'd', although the marked stone would seem to make 'd' not-so-good.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[cp];W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[fc]M[mc]L[lm]C[TS: Again, the marked stone makes this move a bit worthless. 'a' instead would enlarge Black's moyo, so I would play there.]
;W[df]L[cf][oh][of]C[TS: 'a' seems better, even now. But the right still terrifies me - 'b' or 'c'.]
;B[ce];W[di]L[ci]C[Funny shape, but what should I do here?

TS: I think this is playable; another option is 'a'.];B[dj];W[ei]L[fi]
C[TS: Jumping now might be a good idea.];B[ej];W[gi];B[fj];W[ff]L[gg]
[fi]C[TS: 'a' looks like the proper shape; either that or 'b'.];B[fi]
;W[fh];B[ci]L[gh]M[cj][ce]C[TS: One has to wonder what Black is trying to achieve; the cut at 'a' seems better. Black's two marked stones ensure White's eye-space remains minimal.]
;W[ii]L[hf][hh]C[TS: I'd rather jump at 'a', to get closer to the edge, or connect at 'b', which limits Black's potential for a framework below.]
;B[hk];W[fo];B[jk];W[hf]L[fm]C[TS: White's shape seems overconcentrated; 'a' might be better. Yes, White will then probably come under attack, but by being willing to sacrifice something he should survive.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[ip];W[go]L[jq]C[TS: Something like 'a' looks better, since Black can't be caught anyway.]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[jo];W[kp];B[jr];W[kr]L[ki]C[TS: This appears a bit small; I'd play 'a'.]
;B[ho];W[iq]M[br][cq][cr][dr][fq][fp][fo][go]L[hr]C[TS: Again small. In addition, it's gote, so the marked stones are in jeopardy. 'a' seems prudent.]

;W[pj]C[TS: Awfully deep.];B[oh]L[nj]C[TS: Timid. Capping at 'a' is strongest, and also best, I think.]
;W[nj]L[mj]C[TS: White should come out faster, with 'a'.];B[ki]L[mh]
M[ii][nj]C[TS: Jumping once more to 'a' might be better; makes the cutting of the connection of the two marked stones all the more severe.]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[mh];B[oi];W[oj]L[mk]M[pj]C[TS: I would play 'a'. This lets Black cut the marked stone off, which is worth 10-15 points, but you can't have everything, especially with such a deep invasion.]
;B[ni]L[ml][lj][kg]C[TS: Too direct. Black should play 'a', which definitely makes the cut work.  But if White connects with, for example, 'b', 'c' seems to swallow the whole group.]

;B[mj];W[mk];B[lj];W[nl];B[qk]L[mn]C[TS: This one amazes me. 'a' would seem to wrap up the game there and then. Now Black lets White's invasion succeed.
