C[Hi,

The reason you lost this game is because you let your opponent play bigger moves than you AND you left too many weaknesses behind.

I think that you can drastically improve your performance if you ask these 3 questions at each of your moves:

1. Do I have a weakness, if yes fix it.
2. Does my opponent have a weakness, if yes, try to use his weakness for profit.
3. If no one has weakness, find the biggest area and play there.

It will be hard at first, but after about 10 games of seriously asking these questions, you will see results, I garantee it.]

SQ[nc][od][qn][po]C[In the game you played D10.

I'm sure you played this move without thinking. This is the sort of move that makes you lose games without really understanding why you lose.

The corners are much bigger than the sides.

Which corner is bigger? This is the question you MUST ask yourself while you are playing (if you ask yourself this question, you will have better results in your games than if you don't).

C is small because it makes you overconcentrated (all your stones on the left side).

The difference between A and B is more subtle and probably beyond my ability to explain. So I can only say what I prefer.

In this situation, I would prefer to play at the top right corner. Black's stones are on the 3rd line (even on the 2nd line). This means that he will have a hard time building a moyo.

If he has a hard time building a moyo, then I don't need to come in at B right away.

The squares are other moves you can consider. It is really beyond my ability to determine which is best. I suggest you explore them to get a feeling for how they influence the game.]

It has weaknesses that black can exploit to take huge profit on the top and right side of the board.]
;B[ch];W[ci]C[This move is too small.

The corners are still biggest part of the board right now.

Just ignore black, if he wants to play down here, let him and take bigger points.]

Definitely!

Force Black into a low position (on the third line).

Playing at A was your third global mistake (D10 and the weak shape in the top left are the other two).]
;W[qk];B[mp]C[This painful for you and gives too much profit to Black.]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[on]C[I dislike this shape.

Look at Black. All his stones are strong. Your stones all have a lingering weakness.

When your looking for moves, always ask yourself if they will leave a weakness.]

[bl]C[When you play C11, you are affraid that black will add these 2 moves?

Notice how small they are. There is no need to defend against them. Your white stones can easily take care of themselves.

It is important to play your own game. If you keep answering Blacks moves, your not getting enough of the pie.

If black insists to play under you, you get 3 free moves. Black will never play like that, so why do you want to defend against it?]

(;W[fe]C[Perhaps you can try this to shake things up.

I think that starting a fight is the best way to use the D10 stone (You can try to connect over Black and make a nice wall).

There are too many variations to explore, but the important thing is to not let black get influence facing the right side of the board.]
;AW[bb][cc][ff][eh][ei][cl]AB[bc][bd][cd][ch][bj]C[During the fight you aim for something like this (I just added stones, there is no order and it probably won't happen this way).

Black will certainly resist and try to get out in the center. When that happens, you can extend along the top side to take profit.]

Playing at P17 would give white a low position (this would be good for Black).]
