Hi, I'm your reviwer Lib. Hope the review's useful!];B[pd];W[pp]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[np];B[qi]TR[pd]C[Playing the newly learned mini chinese.  Is this a good fuseki against the 4-4?

Hmm...I'm not a fan of fixed fusekis; I prefer to stay flexible and take the initiative. But if I remember correctly, the chinese fuseki has the makred stone at Q17 instead, which discourages W from attacking from the top.

Either way, it's good that you played relatively far away from R6, which balances speed against W's influence (O4 is high)]
;W[ql]TR[on][qq]C[Too early for W. you can just tenuki. in the future, jumping out at P6 puts R8 under attack, and R3 takes a large corner, so its a miai.]

not needed, and a bit slow. playing at Q9 breaks him up just as effectively (though there is a danger, see variation)

C[bad move by W];B[oi]TR[nk][ol]C[?

questionable. the marked stones are too weak for P11 to have any effect]

(;W[ng]C[taking 5th line territory, I didn't mind.  Was this best?

it's rather risky for B, though you still have the advantage. Bear in mind that W can play O8 to divide your groups and put you under a lot of pressure.

And the 5th line is still not confirmed. the 3-3 point is still open.]
;B[of];W[kh];B[nf]C[Slow.

You already have Q16 as reinforcements, so feel free to jump or go further.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lf];B[le];W[kf];B[ke];W[je]C[Again trying to mark off 5th line territory.  Am I being too greedy?  Should I instead develop the weak group?  I am allowing W lots of influence towards LL, but I felt it was ok because of the Q7 group.

Again, Q7 is not THAT strong because of O8. and yes, i think this is a bad trade for B. W turns a weak (almost non-existant) group into a strong power, while B has "5th line territory" that stil has an open 3-3.]

too focused on territory. W now automatically has the bottom side and possibly the center. I'd prefer E6]

this move is not needed. the 3 W stones are already dead.

A strike at F3 / anywhere along the bottom now would be a good idea.]

Overall, i think you were too greedy with regards to territory. As you progress, you'll learn more ways to reduce and invade which kinda makes any territory above 4th line useless. the 3-3 invasion of your 5th line territory is just one example.

You should keep in mind any cutting points in your groups (eg the O8 point, the P17 point) and plan ahead for them.

Before playing your move, ask yourself: is there any point on the board that is bigger? an extension on the side can gain you between 10 to 20 points in territory and secure a base for later fighting, while "threatening" a small opponent group might result in him sacrificing a few stones (maybe 5 points? 10?) and taking sente.

That's all for now, I hope you find this useful!
