 osman 3k*: do you like to type messages ?

[id]L[id][cp][qn][mc]C[With W  J16 (a) it's probably better to make shimari at c4 (b) or exted along the  right side (best is at (c) r6?)

In this situation the white stone is weaker than the black group.  Therefore  black group won't come under attack, and so the top is not the largest area.   Also, black has a weakness at (d) N17 that white's premature assault is  likely to eliminate.]
;B[oe]L[oe][of][gc]C[P15 (a) is an odd response, though.  It allows white to push at (b) and get  influence while making black overconcentrated. Perhaps just counterattacking  at c is best.]

(;W[if]L[fc][pc]C[Probably P14 is best, or playing Q17 (b) first,  and then pushing.  By pushing
up there, white can aim at making black overconcentrated on the top in
return for a nice position facing south, then go back and stabilize the J16
stone.    Also, for stabilizing the white group, f17 (a) is better than J14.  If the  black group were weak, the one point jump would have some meaning, but as it  is, it's probably better to make a base.]
;B[qb]C[B R18   seems small, as black is not weak.  A pincer around Q12 (b) looks
more interesting.];W[qc]L[rb]C[W R17 is not good; black can just respond by  playing S18 (a).

Better would (still) be to play for influence (and to stabilize the wihte
stones) with p14, or just an extension along the right side.];B[pb]C[B Q18 Should be at S18.]
;W[pg]L[pg]C[W Q13 (a) is slack,  because it has no direct effect on the black group, and
doesn't settle the white group properly either.  White should still play  either
P14 or somewhere around r9 to stabilze himself.];B[qj];W[qh]L[qh][pg]
C[W R12 (a) is a humiliating move.  It now becomes apparent that  W Q13 (b) is
badly placed.];B[qm];W[cj]C[I might be tempted  to play D14 instead.];B

 osman 3k*: what happened ?];W[eq]C[
 osman 3k*: are you alive please ?];B[cr]C[B C2 could be at D2.  Then, if white blocks, black can leave  the corner, and if
white doesn't block, black has followup play.]
(;W[jp]L[fm]C[You can't let  black have the atari at F7.  The extension is small.  (look at the variation  where white extends instead)]
;B[lq]C[F7 is still the key  point.];W[dh];B[fm]C[Ahhhhhh.   That hurts (white).]
;W[en]C[
 owk 4k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[gl]C[B G8 seems heavy.  Black is way ahead on territory, so he can  afford to play a little more flexibly, Like maybe the shoulder hit of J5?

If I were black I'd be afraid of the peep at F9, connect, then W J8.];W
[go]C[W G5 seems overly timid.  If black takes this point you can  connect under at
g3.  White's only hope in this game is to get a good attack against the black
center group, but G5 is so slow it may let the attack slip away.];B[il]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[dr];B[dq];W[er]
(;B[bm]C[I don't believe that black B7 is necessary.  Which means that D2 is  no good.  I did a couple of variations where black tenukis and lives in the corner.   What were you planning to play if black tenuki's?]
;W[bl];B[an];W[lo]C[This is good technique by white to  get the attack going again.]
;B[nq]
(;W[ll]C[I might try  peeping a couple times first to make black heavier.]
;B[fi];W[ii]C[This seems like a bit of an overplay, since the white group on the  left isn't
strong.];B[fg];W[ef]C[If you play this knight's move, you have  to have a plan for what to do when
black cuts it.  If black just cuts, white's going to have a very hard time of  it.]

he kills the center group, which, since black has sente,  looks pretty
impossible.];B[dj];W[bg];B[be];W[eh];B[fh]C[
 osman 3k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[ai]C[
 osman 3k*: Increase owk's time by 5 minutes];B[fb]C[F18 is fairly meaningless.  Black should just make sure his  center group is
alive, and wait for white to resign.

The biggest territorial move for black would be K2.];W[gj];B[hj];W[gi];B

(;B[ei]C[Ouch! These stones are  not important.  Black's previous 2 moves start to
sacrifice those stones, so black should continue to sacrifice them, with  H11...]

;W[jm];B[jl];W[ij]C[I'll stop my commentary  on this move, which apparently has only the
purpose of killing black, which quite unrealistic at this point.

Both sides make mistakes in the late middle and early end game, but black
lives, and as expected, white doesn't have enough territory.

I would say that after gaining the lead in the opening, black was never it too
much danger of losing.];B[kl];W[hk];B[hl];W[km];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk];W[nl]
