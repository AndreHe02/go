C[Hello,

     Thank you for reviewing my game.  In this game I played white.  I felt my opponent got the best of me early on.  I felt frustrated and probably started fights I shouldn't have. Please comment on whatever areas of my game you feel need improvement.  Thanks very much for you time.

Hello,

this is Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL, on KGS and in other go places.

When I read your comments I get a feeling that you felt behind a lot in this game and therefore came under some emotional pressure. This happens all the time in a game of go. But it is harmful if we feel like that even when everything is working out just right! 

Actually I think your judgement is based on some wrong assumptions. I want to go a different way in this review and put in a small general lecture about positional judgement, which you can read first to adapt your thinking. Don't worry - of course you will also get the usual in-game-comments! ;-)]
(;B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[jp];W[od]
(;B[pe]LB[pf:A]C[I had no idea how to respond to this so I tenukied and made an enclosure in the lower left. The end result here was painful though.

Hon: There is a joseki where white extends to A instead, probably you have seen it (see variation).

If black could have gone to A, then this move here is actually less than what he was capable off locally and therefore "uneven".]
(;W[co];B[oe]C[Hon: Okay, so your reasoning was that this is very bad for you. Locally it might be, but you played C5 for it! You tenukied, accepted a local disadvantage to get an advantage in another part of the board.]
;W[md];B[oc]
(;W[ne];B[nc];W[mc];B[nd];W[nf];B[og]C[Hon: Okay, so now you probably thought, what a terrible result. Black has a bit more than 20 points in the corner, you have a short wall with a cutting point and no points at all. How can this be any good?

Right, locally it isn't. But compare the number of stones you played. White has played five stones, black has played seven. Black altogether has played two more stones in this area, so it is only natural that he's better off!]
(;W[qn]LB[qn:B][co:A]C[I didn't want to give black such an impressive moyo, but after the sequence here I really felt I was only helping black.

Hon: First of all let us state that in addition to the wall up there - which works together with D17 - you were able to play two moves in other places, while black built territory in the upper right. You played A and B, which are very good, valuable opening plays.]
;B[qk]
(;W[mp];B[oq];W[rp];B[qq];W[on];B[no];W[ok];B[mo]
(;W[lp]C[Hon: This move is too heavy. 

The stone at N4 is outnumbered one to 5 or so, so you can not expect to just walk away. You should rather treat this stone lightly, assuming that all you wanted to do was settle one group in the black moyo, which you achieved on the right. Leave N4 as an aji stone.]
;B[lo];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[jq];B[iq];W[jr];B[hp];W[lr]
;B[nr];W[ir];B[hr];W[mr];B[mq];W[ks];B[pj]C[Here I felt very far behind already. Not sure how to proceed.

Hon: Okay, the sequence down there was not good for you, the reason being that you started playing from a stone that should have better died a natural death. The result is a very small life for you and a lot of influence for black. 

Still - on your level (and on mine) this is no reason to get desperate. We are far from playing perfectly enough to savely transform this advantage into a win.]
(;W[de]C[Hon: This looks like a mistake. 

A shimari is large, but ... (see variation)]
(;B[id]C[Hon: Sooner or later this was to be expected.]
(;W[je]C[Hon: This is no good attacking move, because diagonal approaches are initiating contact.

Black is outnumbered here, so you're the attacker, so you should be evading contact.]
(;B[fc];W[jd]C[Hon: Good.];B[ic];W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[ge];W[gf]
C[Hon: Good. You wall him in tightly. Do you feel it? He's happy with living small, and you start to build a moyo on the left.]
;B[ff]C[Hon: Ooops - black can not be kept in.];W[fg];B[ef]
;W[cg]C[Hon: But well, you just press him some more and make some more points.]
;B[eg];W[gq];B[hq];W[jn]C[Hon: Now we see that black's wall was not even as strong as he might have thought - he is split and the left half of it is not yet alive.

Of course he will not die - but you will get points on the left side while teasing him.]
;B[hn];W[jm];B[lm]C[Hon: The problem is that you did not defend the group on the right side in time. 

As we are discussing the true meaning of "even", we started to see that almost always there is a miai point of equal value some place else on the board, like in the example where you just let that group die.

But one has to watch out that stones don't die for no substitute!

You are running with your K6 stones, which is not doing a lot, but in the meantime black kills your stones on the right. This is not "even", since you achieve much less than you could have. 

To state an easy principle - don't go on a hunt when your house is burning. First you defend the lower right group, then you cut at K6!

Actually dying down here is what will cost you the game. Some other things also were not perfect, like your shape in the upper center looks thin, but it was all not decisive. This sequence here is.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[pr];B[qr];W[oj];B[pi]
(;W[ll];B[ml];W[lk];B[nm]
(;W[nn];B[mn];W[km];B[pl]TR[oj][lk][ok][ll][jm][km][jn]C[Hon: Ouch.

Well ... okay. You know, I think, this loss was not "even", I even think this might have been the reason for your downfall.

But let's not side with white or black - let's assume our cool whole-board view. 

What have you got for "sacrificing" the lower right?

You have increased your influence in the center, starting to construct a moyo with your stones at the top. 

So it was not all in vain (But still a bad trade in this case)!]
;W[ol];B[om];W[pm];B[qm];W[rm];B[pn];W[rl];B[qo];W[rn];B[rk]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[sq]C[Hon: This whole sequence was wishful thinking. You should not play moves of which you know they don't work. Rather preserve the aji - there might be a ko fight.]
;B[sl];W[dj];B[fp];W[fh];B[fq];W[er];B[eb];W[db]C[Hon: Okay, from here on there will be some quarrels, but its largely endgame. 

Say, you didn't lose that big in the end, did you? "Only" about 20 points. If you had managed to live in the lower right, the game would be quite close.

Your left side turned into a decent territory which quite well matches black's territory on the right - just as it should be. This is the natural whole-board "evenness" of go.

At our level the things that really cost us the game is - easily put - when we try to live somewhere and die. THAT is really bad. But things like the "joseki" in the upper right, where you tenukied to get c5, or the invasion of the lower side, where you lived very small, that may be not perfect from a real strong player's point of view, but it does not really cost you the game. As long as there is some compensation for what you lose, you can still fight.

And more often than you might assume a result only just LOOKS imperfect but actually, considering the initial distribution of stones is just ...

... "even".

(;B[pm]C[Hon: ... if black can torment your stones there, his wall will be working perfectly, and then you might be on the road to defeat - 

But wait! Am I just falling into the trap myself?

Let us try to stay open minded and assume you just refuse to defend.]
;W[id]C[Hon: Instead you make a moyo on the upper side.];B[pn]
C[Hon: Consequently black destroys your group in the lower right ...]
;W[di]C[Hon: ... but you build up your moyo some more. 

If we look at this board position, who is better? 

Okay, white lives with two points on the lower side. White has been annihilated in the lower right. Black is in control of the whole lower and right side sector. 

But what about white? He did not just pass - while he refused to play necessary defensive moves, he turned the whole upper and left side into an equally large formation! So is he really that much worse?

I don't want to say that this is "even", but now first black will have to reduce or invade your moyo. Then you will fight. And since he is just as strong as you, he might also get not such a good result. Not the BEST result. He will be outnumbered, so he will not get anything great even if he plays the best local sequences - unless you make mistakes.

If we kill groups like that one on the right, we tend to think, that it wins us the game. And then we are surprised when the game is still close, when we even lose. The reason is that we haven't really understood what "even" means. We got to look at the whole board!]
))
(;W[ql]C[Hon: You just settle now, try to make a living shape.

Let's assume you live here. What will be the end result? You have destroyed the black potential on the lower side living there. You have split up the moyo by making a living group on the right. If you manage to do so, then black's wall will not have such a great effect, and he will be left with a bit of vague influence and safe points in the upper right.

I am not saying that this was really good for you, or even "even" - but we tend to overestimate these kind of things. "Ha - now I can not lose", thinks black. But often he DOES lose. Because the advantage maybe was not big enough to be easily translated into a win.]
))
(;W[ql]C[Hon: Starting with this move for example you can easily build some living shape. Of course black gets solidified here, but that is only natural, since this is his stronghold. Even if black gets points, it is still "even". 

Black will get his share of depression when he starts playing on the left side. You just wait for that and be happy with what you get here.]
)
(;W[hq]C[Hon: Later you can play here, using the aji of the N4 stone to force black to make another defensive move. At the same time you extend from your shimari in the lower left. This is a better way to use N4.

But first you probably have to make shape for the group in the lower right.]
))
(;W[qq]TR[qk][jp][pp]C[Hon: Simpler would be to just enter the corner. This is good enough for you - compare the sanrensei-discussion in my little lecture.

R6 is outnumbered against the marked stones, so it's only natural that the stone doesn't achieve a lot. It is "even".]
))
(;W[id]C[Hon: I think it would be better to play an extension so that your wall does not come unter attack - but I am not sure about it. Maybe you can treat the wall lightly and decide later what you do with it. 

Anyway it is important to not only think locally. If you stand inferior in one place, you're probably superior in another.]

))
(;C[Hon: In your game as an example you enter your opponent's moyo, get pincered, help him settle his territory and feel like you have been outplayed. Actually this judgement seems to be based on the false assumption that you should get a result everywhere which is "even".

This term of go analysis is a source of many misunderstandings, so I want to elaborate a bit on what "even" actually means. 

First of all, an example.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[Hon: We see this kind of position every day.

Here normally we start thinking about how to keep black's moyo from growing too much.]
;W[nq]C[Hon: Let's say, you approach.];B[lq]C[Hon: Black pincers ...]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]C[Hon: ... and at the end of a very usual joseki white gets the corner and black gets a wall.

At this point one might compare. What has white, what has black? White has about ten points in the corner. He is surrounded, so that group can not play much of a role any longer, also it can not grow a lot. 

Black on the other hand has a huge structure, and the wall is working perfectly together with his other stones. So actually ... isn't white outplayed here? Isn't white already losing the game? How can a small corner compare with this kind of huge structure?]
;W[jd]C[Hon: But let's go on. 

Let's say, white extends here next. He reduces black's moyo and starts to build one of his own. Now let's say ...]
;B[cf]C[Hon: ... Black approaches this corner. What will white do?]
;W[dj]C[Hon: One normal answer is a pincer, which works together with D4.]
;B[fc];W[ee];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd]C[Hon: At the end of the sequence, out of nothing, white also has a moyo!

And isn't black equally bad off? He only has a small group in the corner with no influence, a weak stone on the outside and a white huge structure he still has to whittle down.

(This is not meant as an example of a perfect fuseki, it's only meant to illustrate a principle.)

So what has happened here?];AE[cc][dc][fc][gc][cd][gd][hd][jd]
[ee][cf][dj][pj][mo][op][qp][lq][nq][pq][qq][nr]C[Hon: Actually what happened was very normal. 

When white played on the right side, he couldn't expect to get an "even" result, because BLACK WAS ALREADY THERE!

This is the key idea to understand the term "even". We can not think like "both got to have the same amount of this and that", but we have to see that the right side is blacks sphere of influence and white can not hope for too much there. 

On the other hand, white has his own sphere of influence on the left side, and when black finally enters there, it will be just the same - black will be on the disadvantage.

But actually it is no disadvantage but the natural course of the game. When enemy stones are already in place you achieve less than him - locally.]
;B[pj]C[Hon: When black plays here, he already has three stones on the right side, so ...]
;W[nq]C[Hon: ... when white finally approaches, he is totally outnumbered. He can not expect too much, since it's three against one!

Considering this, living with perfect safety in the corner, acquiring 10 safe points AND even sente (!) is actually not so bad, is it?

And when black finally enters the left side, he will be just as happy getting a small life, because he can not hope for more when white is already there.

In the end it all equals out!];AE[dd][pd][pj][dp][pp][nq]C[Hon: From here let's start a small detail analysis.

The lower right corner is empty. Who ever plays there first, decides how the whole quarter of the board will look like in the end. Playing the first move in an empty corner is very big, as every go player knows.]
;B[qp]C[Hon: Since it is so big though, white will normally get inspired by black's idea and take an empty corner of his own. Like this he can maintain equilibrium. 

But when white finally approaches the corner down there ...]
;W[oq]C[Hon: ... then he is not first. Black is already there, so white can not assume that he gets exactly as much as black. Black was here first, so quite naturally, black will be a bit better in the end.

The evaluation of different joseki is a difficult matter asking for patient study, but let's just take a simple variation.]
;B[mq];W[oo];B[pn];W[lp];B[pq];W[lq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr]
C[Hon: Let us look at this joseki for example.

Joseki are regarded to be even. In this sequence black gets something like 15 points in the corner and some developing potential on the right. What has white got? He has captured one stone, so it is two points. 

How can 15 vs. 2 be even!? But white also has thickness which he can use in a fight. But still, doesn't black have quite a lot of points there?

The answer is - of course, since he was here first! Considering that black was in this corner first, white has done well and he has taken what was still there to take. And this - although it does not look even, is what in go we call "even" - the best possible result considering the stones who are already there.

Another example.];AB[qm][pp]AE[pn][oo][lp][qp][lq][mq][nq][oq]
[pq][mr][nr][or];B[tt]C[Hon: Let's say, black has this formation. Since white does not want black to have all the corner ...]
;W[pq]C[Hon: ... he comes in here and tries to make a group.]
;B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[op];B[po];W[kq]C[Hon: Let's say this happens. You will find this sequence in many joseki books, so it is supposed to be even.

How can this be even? Black has 15 points, white maybe has two points! (Black can play the monkey jump in sente in the endgame, so we can not count the points here for white) Worse - white is not even very thick this time, later there might be an invasion!

Still, although it is not even, it is - "even". The reason is, that this time black had played two stones, before white bothered to enter this corner. When the quarrel started, he was outnumbered and naturally got not such a great result. But - considering he did what he could and made no mistake and at least put a living group here, he has done well enough. And this is "even".

But let's go on.];AB[oq]AE[po][op][kq][pq][qq][qr];B[tt]C[Hon: Let's assume this time black has played three moves in the corner.

Now the corner has been transformed into safe points - white can not invade any longer, at least not without massive changes in the surroundings. So black has almost 20 points there, and he also has influence in this quarter of the board.

Looking at this alone makes you sad - but we have to assume that white played equally valuable moves in another part of the board, so this is not necessarily unbalanced.]
;W[jq]C[Hon: White might at one point come here to reduce the influence of the corner, but he can not hope for a lot of points here.

Black does not care. Maybe he plays M3 later, but maybe he first does something else ...]
;B[tt];W[mq]C[Hon: ... so white gets this point too. It reduces the influence of the corner formation some more, but black is not threatened at all; he plays somewhere else.]
;B[tt]C[Hon: Now white can maybe do something!];W[qq]C[Hon: He enters here. There are other variations, but let's say ...]
;B[qp]C[Hon: ... black plays it solid and defends with R4.]
;W[or]C[Hon: White goes here, and now black can not play on O2, because white would then live in the corner.]
;B[pr]C[Hon: He has to retreat.];W[nr]C[Hon: After white pulls back ...]
;B[qr]C[Hon: Black even has to play here.

But in the end ... what has happened? Black still has 15 points. Not 20 anymore, but we also have to consider that he played somewhere else, when white approached this formation. White played this endgame sequence here in sente - a small consolation. But ... was it really worth it? 

Black has played somewhere else twice, when white approached, and now, after this sequence, black has 15 points and white has 6. How can this be even?

It may not look even, but it is "even". When white started to play in this area, black had already played three stones in this corner. When white finally played here, he was terribly outnumbered. To a degree that he could only approach as far as K3 without danger! It was only natural that his position ended up inferior. 

But actually it isn't. Considering the original conditions, this result is "even".]
;AE[qm][pp][qp][jq][mq][oq][qq][nr][or][pr][qr]C[Hon: Before we look into the game let us summarize.

"Even" in go means that both sides have played in a local area and achieved as much as possible considering the surrounding conditions when the sequence started.

So what is "uneven", disadvantageous then? Uneven is, if you fail to achieve what you should, considering the initial local distribution of stones. 

For example ...];W[tt];AB[qm][pp];B[tt];W[pq]C[Hon: Let's say, white comes here as we saw before.]
;B[qq];W[oq];B[qr]C[Hon: But not, forgetting how the joseki went ...]
;W[lq]C[Hon: ... white extends too early.];B[op]C[Hon: Black would press ...]
;W[nq]C[Hon: ... and white ends up with a small group. 

Wait - it was small before too, right? Then it was okay, why isn't it okay now? 

It is not okay, not "even", because white failed to do, what he could and achieved LESS than he could.

This is how we judge local "evenness" in go. Before we play in a local place we got to have realistic expectations about what we will be able to accomplish there. If these expectations are correct and we also succeed in getting what we should get, then that is enough, even if at times it may look tiny-tiny.

But now let's hurry back to the beginning and start with the actual game!]
