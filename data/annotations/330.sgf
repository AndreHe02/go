KM[5.5];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[pi]C[RR:  Good Chinese opening, my favorite!]
;W[co]C[RR:  W is ok, bout should probably play around K4.  Both moves OK.]
;B[jq]C[RR:  Good move by B.];W[hq];B[cf]C[RR:  This is an area where a high dan can better answer this, but I think
That a move around K16 would be better.  That way, it would looke like
Black has control of rt side and center, while white only has left side.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fc];B[qe]C[
 miro 17k*: where r u from?

RR:  Perhaps leaving the two stones on the left isn't a good idea now.
I would jump one more time, or press  at D11, or play E12.  But since
it is 3 white stones against 2 black stones, black can get into trouble
here!
Besides, if White jumps into R15, that is exactly what black wants! (see
a chinese fuseki book for details)];W[nc];B[lc]C[RR:  Good, this is correct]
;W[mb];B[hc]C[RR:  On the third line, it is best to only jump two spaces, so this move
should be at J17.  You can jump three spaces if the other stones nearby
aren't strong.  Now, white should play at K17, and split your group.

However, I think a better move would have been straight down at M17.
Block white's access to eye space on the edge, and chase white into the
middle!];W[hb]C[RR:  This seems like the wrong direction.  Should play at M18 to get eye space
for the group at N18.

This move is ok too, since in the upper left corner, it is now 3 stones against
2 (now 3.)];B[gc]C[RR:  Should block at J18.  That keeps the B group together and strong.
This only makes white strong, and does nothing for black.

There is a proverb, always hane in front of two stones.  Well, by B playing
here, is forcing W to have a good position.];W[gb];B[jc]C[RR:   Doesn't really do much.  J18 would be better.]
;W[ne];B[ge]C[RR:  Should push the 3 white stones against your black stones on the right
side.  So a move at M15 would be better.  This is the basic stratigy for playing
the chinese fuseki.  (especially when Q11 is high!)];W[fd]C[RR:  This move threatens to cut apart the black groups.
Life is much easier when everything is connected!  Perhaps
a Black play around H14 will work?  (I haven't read it out)];B[cd]C[RR:  Not much for B to attack, since W has lots of eye space.  (Corner  plus upper edge)  Better to stay connected, and attack later.  Still some
big fuseki points to take.  Other points I would play in this situation:

M15
K5
Q7 or R7
P18];W[de];B[ce]C[RR:  Probably better to connect at D14, and use your outside wall to
attack the W stone at C12.  Now you will be cut, against two strong
white groups.];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[dc];W[ec];B[ee]C[RR:  What happens if you throw in at E16 instead?  After W capture, B
ataris at F15.  Possible to kill?  Maybe.  But B can get strong around the
outside while threatening to kill.];W[ed];B[dh];W[cj];B[di]C[RR:  Should live in the corner first.  D18 might work.]
;W[db];B[bg];W[bh];B[ag];W[bc];B[ci];W[bi];B[cc];W[cb];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[The last 4-5 B moves only help white.  Since there is a white group
around O15, this B wall won't get much.];W[gd];B[hd];W[he];B[hf]C[RR:  Not always best to atari first.  Perhaps a play at G14, which makes
a bamboo joint with E15:E14, and threatens to capture W H15 in a ladder.
After W extends here, the B group H17 can be captured, so this move is  Black gote.]

 miro 17k*: nice...

RR:   Now, white is VERY strong on the top, and black is forced into a small
center position.  The game is still close, if B can keep the rt side
and the bottom.];B[ig];W[nq];B[np]C[RR:  This makes K3 very weak, and thus the bottom side may be lost.
A simple 1 pt jump to Q6 is very good.];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[lq];B
[mo]C[If you don't protect your P4 cut here, then jump out to K5, and try to save
K3 at this point.

Making a wall is a good idea, but not as good as trying to pull out K3.]
;W[kp];B[lo]C[RR:  Again, still time to pull out K3,  Now, B should play J4.]
;W[jp];B[kg]C[RR:  I don't know if there enough points in the middle for B to win now.
The bottom side loss was absolutly hugh.  If B can kill O17 stones, then
B still has a chance, but this will be very difficult.
Perhaps K13 at O13 instead];W[ke];B[le];W[lf];B[lg];W[mf];B[ng];W[qi];B
[qj]C[Tough fight for W.  Not really needed though.  W is ahead I think.]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[qg]C[RR:  It is a good thing to have W crawl on the 2nd line, so keep pushing at R8.]
