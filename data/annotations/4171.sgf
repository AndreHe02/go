AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

thanks in advance for your review. I made some annotations for myself, but nevertheless I don´t get a grip on a game with (at least for my taste) so many handicap stones to fight against. Any suggestions would be welcome :-)




drsb [16k\]: Hello!

jpl: Hello, Sven.  I'm about an 8k player and will do my best.

Initial comments...  I can't tell from this game, but there wasn't a 6-stone difference between the two players.  Against your play style, black played stronger than 22k.  Black's play was solid without glaring, huge mistakes.

That being said, in high handicap games, you need to think about a few things.  First, there's a high handicap because of the expectation that black will make mistakes.  But it's your job to help him make those mistakes.  If your style is one in which black is comfortable, then he will make fewer mistakes.

You played a very tight game -- a tactical game far more than a strategic game.  The first 37 moves were in the upper right corner.  I feel this is a huge strategic mistake on your part, in a high handicap game.  You got caught up in the tactics (and came out ahead), but I think you lost strategically.

I'm not going to analyze your tactics.  That's not what lost the game.  Instead, I'm going to look at strategy.

I come across a little harsh during the ongoing comments, but see my comments at the end.

But before that, I want to be sure we both understand the difference between tactics and strategy.

Tactis win the battles.  Strategy wins the war.  Tactics are about the fights -- how to invade a corner, that sort of thing.

Strategy is above that -- deciding which corners you want to invade, and what you want to come out of the exchange with.  It's understanding that a couple of stones on one side of the board extend their influece all the way across to the other side.]
;W[nc]C[vivian [22k\]: hi u brave
drsb [16k\]: :-)];B[qf];W[pb];B[lc];W[qd]C[JPL: Here's your first opportunity to think strategically.  You can make an invasion play near the top left corner instead of continuing to fight for a handhold in the upper right.  Perhaps a play at F16 followed by an extension around H17 or so.  This squeezes the stone at M17 -- you can chase him into the center while building strength on other side.

Alternatively you could invate around R6 so as to keep the black side smaller.  A few stones down in this direction gives your stop stones more influence and a place to run.]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[qe];W[ne]C[JPL: Again, move around.  In a high-handicap game, you need to play a lot lighter.  F16 looks even better now.]

(;B[ri];W[se];B[sh];W[rf]C[arndt [8k?\]: No, T15 black instead of S11


JPL: Okay, move 37.  Every move so far has been in the upper right.  Let's look at how you're sitting at this point.

You've taken the upper left corner for about 10 points.

You've developed some influence along the upper side, but that influence is beleagured and weak.  However, it's in a position to do some huge damage to black's wall along the P-line.  Unfortunately, I don't think you saw how vulnerable black was.  I'll comment more on that later.

You have some minor center influence from your stones around Q13.

Black has a very impressive wall around R11, with the potential for a huge lower right side.  I repeat huge.

Let's move on.];B[qm]C[
JPL: This is a solid move on Black's part.  It acknowledges the solid wall.   might have made it at R6 instead, but this is a solid move.]
;W[mh]C[
JPL: I don't like seeing more moves for the upper right side, but I admit this is a decent strategic move, building some center influence.  It also contributes to pressure on black's vulnerable group near the P-line.

However, again, a good time to play elsewhere and come back later.]
;B[nd];W[gc]C[JPL: Joseki...  F17.  G17 puts no pressure anywhere and invites an effective scissors.  In the process, you give black more influence along the upper side, which you really can't afford.]
;B[ic];W[db];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb];W[ge]C[JPL: Instead of G15, play elsewhere.  Your top stones are fairly strong, you need to extend influence over a greater portion of the board.

Invade at O3, F3 or F4, or C6.];B[dc]C[JPL: I feel this was a weak move on black's part.  Very very small move, but it drew you into another tactical fight.  You can't afford to waste this time on tactics -- you need to be laying out a boardwide strategy.]

(;W[ea]LB[eb:A]C[Should have at A, as I realized about 1/2 second after my mouseclick...

JPL: Okay, is E19 the biggest move on the board?  Absolutely not.  Attacking either lower corner is much bigger.

Every move you make, you need to ask, "Is this the biggest move on the board?"]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[hb];B[hc];W[ib]
(;B[fc]C[vivian [22k\]: me too


I had lots of luck that black made this mistake...]
(;W[gd];B[jb];W[ga];B[jd]C[JPL: At this point, you've got life on the upper side for a few points.  Black has secured the corner and has probably life right next to yours, and has added a lot of pressure against your stones at O17.

Basically, you were drawn into a tactical fight, and black's tactics are almost as good as yours.]
;W[fq]C[JPL: There we go.  However, when you made this play, what were you thinking?  (Not criticism, just tryng to get you thinking strategically).

You have stones on the upper side that exert significant influence down the board.

Which means you can think about working with that influence.  F3 by itself is a good move, but F4 may work with the available influence a little better.]
;B[hq]C[JPL: Black is cocky to play a scissors.];W[dq];B[cq]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[eq];B[br];W[cp]C[Here I wanted to concede the corner for central influence...]
;B[bq];W[do];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[cm]C[JPL: I like this so far.  It points to your stones on the top side nicely.  An invasion at O4 then puts pressure on the black stone at H3.]
;B[bn]LB[cl:A]
(;W[bm]LB[cl:A]C[... and became greedy :-)

on A?

JPL: Well, if you want center influence, then play for center influence.

I don't think B7 was bad if you're aiming to reduce black's influence along the upper left side.

However, I think B7 is a pretty small move compared to O4 or E14.]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[dk]C[JPL: Okay -- this shows why you need to decide what your goals are.  Your play at B7 wasn't bad, except you switched gears right away.  B7 was a side strength play, but then you went back to center strength.]
;W[er];B[ds]
(;W[mq]LB[nq:A]C[Should this one have been one space to the right?
I wanted to save the option to invade at 3-3 later...

JPL: I try to play standard joseki.  So yes, A would be the more standard move.

Invading at 3-3 is a very small move, and a 6-stone game isn't going to be decided by small moves.

However, if you want center and side influence, O4 is stronger.  It's not an invasion move, it's an influence move.]
;B[kq];W[mo];B[mm]C[JPL: You're so far from the corner that there's no pressure.  This gives black more opportunity to push pretty hard on you.]
;W[ko];B[ho];W[jq]C[JPL: This move says "I'm not going to let you live."  I think it's too late to say that to black.  I think a play around E14 is much bigger.]
;B[jp];W[jr];B[kr];W[kp];B[iq];W[lq];B[ir];W[gp];B[hp];W[gn]
;B[go];W[fo];B[gq];W[gm];B[fp];W[ep];B[jo];W[kn]C[JPL: I'm concerned that you're still trying to kill a living group without gaining anything for yourself.  Black is securing his group but you're not getting anything for letting him do that.

P3 might work to secure life for your group, but I still think I'd look at bigger plays.]
;B[jn];W[kl];B[jm];W[jl];B[km];W[lm];B[ll];W[ln];B[mk];W[lr]
;B[ks];W[ls];B[js]C[JPL: Let's look at how you came out of this...

Black has life in the lower middle.   You have small life near E4 but large influence towards the center.  You also have a nice wall facing towards the right, but I think you're going to be hard pressed to do much with it.

Black won this exchange because he was able to minimize the territory you gained without losing anything on the right or left sides (yet, anyway).]
;W[pr];B[oq]C[What now? Take the corner? I was afraid of weaking my center group, which I thought was not yet alive...]

(;W[or]C[JPL: Risk vs. reward.  Taking the corner may have won huge on the right side, but black has been playing strong tactically, and I think you would have had problems with your wall.

I'd have played P2 just as you did.  I'm not sure I'd have played Q2 though.  You need to think about how huge black's right side is and do something about it.  Q2 doesn't do that.

Of course, black could have played R3 or S3 and completely secured that side.]
;B[qq]C[JPL: Ah, I should have looked ahead.  Yes, solid move for black.]
;W[qr];B[rq]LB[le:B][cf:A][oo:C]
(;W[op]LB[le:B][cf:A][on:C]C[If I have a look onto the final territories, this must have been a very bad move ...
Perhaps A or B or C?

JPL: P4 is a very very small move.  I think both A and B are much bigger moves.]
;B[pq];W[nq]C[JPL: This is another very small move.];B[oo];W[nn]
C[JPL: Another time to ask -- what were you thinking about at this point?  While this isn't a bad move, what is the goal?  It doesn't capture territory.  Black's stones are alive, so it doesn't really put much pressure on them.

This move  doesn't capture territory or extend influence, but gives black additional opportunities to improve his strength.

Think about what the board would look like with a stone at E14 or M15.  How about L10 or 11?  Even J8 does more for you.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[om];W[nl];B[ol];W[nk];B[ok]C[JPL: A LOT of plays for a small gain.  Black secured a 5-th line right side and you captured 3 stones (maybe).]
;W[nj];B[kk]C[JPL: Again, I think you came out behind.  You gained another 10 points, but you allowed black to completely secure the right side for about 20 points.]
;W[jk];B[kj];W[jj];B[ki]TR[kj][kk]C[was it possible to catch the black center group?

JPL: Not by chasing it around.  You may have been able to trap it by thinking more strategically.  Put pressure on the stones around K16, forcing black to build small life on the upper side.  Maybe in the process you could trap the P-line stones, completely turning around the game.  In any case, you'd have eliminated places for black to run, then those center stones would die.]

(;W[jh];B[ji];W[ii];B[kh];W[jg];B[kg]
(;W[jf]C[JPL: Think about what playing this at M14 might have done instead.  You would have been telling black to pick which group lives -- center or P-line.]

JPL: Okay, here's what I think....

Your tactics are strong -- probably as strong as mine or very close.  You don't make glaring tactical mistakes (at least none that I found glaring, see a 1-dan for a different answer).

However, you're now moving into a new phase of go -- strategic thinking.  If you can start thinking about strategy, you'll gain several stones -- perhaps 6 to 8 -- nearly immediately, I'd guess.

You tend to play a bit "heavy".  Your stones tend to be close to each other.  This is part of the strength of your tactics, but it means the individual stones do less for you strategically.

So...

Every few moves, you need to analyze where you're at and what you hope to accomplish.

You need to use misdirection.  If you want to kill one group, attack another to build influence.  Your opponent then decides which group gets to live.  Ignore your attack and then you say "okay, I'll just kill this group".  If he defends against your attack, you build a wall -- you build influence -- that you then use to surround another group.  Let him appear to win a small tactical battle by fending off your attack, but you build up influence towards your real goal.

You need to play lighter.  One or two stones in a corner, then switch to the other side.  Don't give black the opportunity to build huge strength with which he can crush you.  Small, light play.  It's more dangerous -- you'll get crushed yourself.  But while he's crushing your light stones, you'll be building more influence.

With a couple of stones in one corner and a couple in the other, it's just one or two plays to secure the entire side in between.  And if black invades anyway?  Then make sure you build surround his previously-strong corner and built up huge influence along the side that he could have secured instead of invading.

Okay, I'm babbling.

1. Your tactics are strong, but heavy.  You don't lose tactically.

2. But you really need to move to a more strategic game.  You'll lose some games in the meantime, but you'll start to learn what works.]
