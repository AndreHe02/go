(;B[kq]C[rs220675: Wrong direction. The move itself is ok, but not efficient enough. From a black wall like that you should be able to expant more than 3 points; see var.]

(;B[dq]C[rs220675: Ok, but the variation is a bit better because more pressured.]

(;B[oh]C[rs220675: Bad move. You need to esatblish are base for your group so that the group can live easily. That is always important, esp. in the beginning of the game and if you invade a moyo. You won't make immediate profit with such an attitude, but later it will pay out., just be patient.; see var.]

C[rs220675: White is striking back, because you gave him the opportunity in the left bottom corner and on the left side with your sloppy play against fundamental go rules (the master would say :)).]

C[rs220675: Ok, from here it seems a typical 5k game. You made two mistakes that already got back to you here:

1. You didn't follow the rule to establish stable groups that live or have enough room to live so that you don't feel to play there more to secure something. That is the most important tool to become stronger...if you realize that big & fancy moves can not make up for necessary moves to avoid pressured or death groups.
2. You didn't have a good understanding of how to invade a moyo or how to react a moyo invasion (I wasn't better when I was 6k :)). If you invade a moyo, try to establish a gruop that is not pressured hard, if someone invades in your moyo try to avoid that he establishes a strong group. The strategic idea behind moyo is not to make quickly big territory but to force the opponent to invade, so then one can fight.]

(;B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]))
(;B[gq];W[lq];B[cq]TR[iq][lq]C[rs220675: Even with just a passive move like that black has an huge advantage by now, because he has a big moyo that becomes harder to invade/reduce and the two marked white stones are under pressure, so white will have to rescue them and if white does so you can use that to accomplish other things (like invading the white moyo at left or work on your moyo at the right)]
))
(;B[qb];W[rc];B[jc]C[rs220675: With your actual cornerplay decision you give white a big moyo at the left side so you should also think big. More important than to make territory is to make your stones insperable and good balanced. Territory comes then later naturally. And the makred black stones is basically not to cut or at the expense of some disadvantages for white.]
