AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello, my name is Michael and I played this game as black on kgs.

I did not put many comments/questions in this game because I would have had a question to nearly every second move...

It would be important to me to know my biggest lacks, my worst mistakes in the line of play.

I try to play solid, but that ends up in too less terretory. I avoid fighting, because I can not calculate the outcome.

====
I have highlighted several lines of play during the course of the game where I think you could change something.  My thought about your play overall is that perhaps you're too cautious.  In a four stone handicap game, you start with a large advantage, and you have star-points, which have favor influence over territory.  So you need to take chances to attack the opponent.  You don't have to be overly aggressive, but you can't win by always defending.]
;W[nq];B[pn]C[Somebody told me this is a good answer...

This is a good way to respond.];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[...and again.
Is it to passive in this situation?

I've seen the pincer recommended, but I can't say I think this move is wrong.  I often play it in this situation.]
;W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[Is there a better move than R3?

R3 is fine.  The outside move is interesting, because it would prevent white from making the whole bottom settled.  But I would still probably play R3.]
;W[jq]C[Now I am not sure how to answer K3.]
(;B[pj]C[I think playing at R10 is the natural move to secure this group.  The two high moves leaves more potential for invasion.]
;W[ql]C[When white invades, none of Black's responses are completely satisfying.]

(;B[qg]C[Besser Q8?

Yes.  More important is the principle: white's stone is weak, it is invading your area.  You don't have to try and kill it, but you have to pressure white.  By playing away, this move gives white an easier time.]
;W[rn]
(;B[rp]C[By itself, this move doesn't make much eyespace.];W[rj]
;B[eq]C[Dealing with the group in the lower right is urgent.  Play urgent moves before big ones.]
;W[fp]TR[iq]MA[hq]C[In this situation, I think that the kick gives white what he wants.  If white has a stone at the triangled spot, he becomes overconcentrated or subject to attack, so you might play the kick.  Here, it just makes his position more solid, and makes it hard to invade at the X point.]
;B[er]C[This is sort of small.  It threatens to take away white's base, but I think white should've ignored that and played a big point.]
;W[fr]
(;B[fm]C[Locally, this move tries to attack the bottom group, but white's stones are too solid for it to be very effective.  Also, it is too high and loose to build anything on the left side.  

Globally, it is far from the biggest point.  Perhaps K16 would build a framework in the top.]
;W[cl]
(;B[dk]C[Is this the right direction to block?

The idea of limiting white's space from the top is very good, but I wouldn't play the shoulder hit.  The shoulder hit is a reducing move, which usually lets both sides defend themselves.  Here, white's stone is isolated, so you don't want to help it.]
;W[ck];B[cn]TR[dk]C[This move is too cautious, and now the triangled stone looks wasted.]
;W[dj]
(;B[ek]TR[dk]C[It's important to think ahead and ask yourself what you want.  These triangled stones will only be important if you can attack white's group.  But by playing to save these stones, you give up the chance to attack.  Instead, you should play a move to stop white from settling.]
;W[cg]TR[dk][ek]
(;B[cf]C[Is C15 the better move?

C15 or F17 or G17, I think.  A contact move serves to strengthen both sides.  White is not under tremendous danger here, but you still don't wish to help him.]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[dg];B[gd];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[I think pincering is right here.  One of the more distant pincers might strike a nice balance with your stones in the left.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[ne]
(;B[of]TR[lc]C[Your marked stone feels a little too close to the white stones, and a little too far from your own.]
;W[bc]
(;B[cc]C[Would C16 have been the more solid move?

C16.  A16 is another thought, but it probably doesn't work.]
;W[ad]
(;B[bb]C[You shouldn't risk the ko here, just connect instead.  Playing this ko is like inviting your opponent to a fistfight in your dining room.]
;W[cd]C[If you are going to play the ko, you should have already thought about possible ko threats, and you should play them.]

(;B[bn];W[cd];B[ed];W[df]
(;B[jd];W[id]C[Here I am not sure how to answer J16.  

It's trickier than I expected, and I'm not sure I know the answer either.  I've included several variations with my thoughts, but nothing is definite.]

Yes. R2, followed by the invasion might be better.];W[rh];B[rg]
