C[M:  Hi!  Thanks for giving me a chance to look at your game.  I'll comment on both sides frequently at the beginning of the game and will just point out large mistakes later.  

M:  Study of the opening (either at Sensei's or from a book like "In the Beginning") could help your game a lot.  In the mid game, make sure you have access to the center; you were forced to make some fairly deep jumps into enemy territory, and they weren't punished as effectively as they could have been.  Finally, as always, keep doing your life and death problems.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[Dlugar: Is it better to play on the 3-4 point than the 4-4 point or is it simple a matter of taste?

M:  The third line is for territory, the fourth for influence.  A move at 4-4 
is purely for influence (it secures no territory, as the 3-3 invasion works), 
while a play at 3-4 is more territorial and prefers one side over the other.  
For example, the play at D3 "prefers" the bottom side over the left side.

M:  Note that since white played D3, black has no good approach along the bottom.  The 3-4 stone is limiting the influence of black's 4-4 stone in the bottom right corner.]
;B[dj]C[M:  Avoiding the chinese fuseki?  Another option is to simply develop from your Q16 stone; make a kakari at F17.]
;W[qn]C[M:  I dislike this move.  It invites black to extend along the bottom, reducing the effectiveness of the stone at D3.  O3 would be a better kakari against the Q4 stone.]
;B[qo]C[M:  Given that a 4-4 stone is played for influence, using it to take territory isn't efficient.  O4 and O3 are good moves that emphasize the bottom.  Q8 
and R8 are good pincers.  

M:  Note that this move doesn't secure the corner well at all.  Later, white can aim at R3 or Q2.]
;W[pn]
(;B[op]C[M:  This is too tight.  O3 is normal.];W[pk]C[M:  Q10 or R10 (one line further from the wall) is normal.  The general rule is an N+1 extension from a wall of height N.]
;B[ol]C[M:  This move is rash.  An extension along the bottom is big, the P8 stone 
can easily be disconnected (by O6), and the white stones are quite strong.]

(;W[ro]C[M:  This move helps black, as it eliminates white's aji in the corner.  Separating the black stones is more important.]
;B[rp];W[nn];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[qf]C[M:  R7 is a big weakness.]
;B[jp];W[cg];B[qe]C[M:  If you want the corner, R16 is better.  I would prefer an extension down the side -- to O17 or O16.]
;W[of]C[M:  Q14 is better.  It's more solid and doesn't give black the options of wedging at Q14 or peeping at Q13.]
;B[jd]C[M:  Too far.];W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[mb]C[M:  N18 should be at P17.]

(;W[nb]C[M:  I prefer P17 to O18.  (See variation.)];B[oc]
(;W[md]C[Dlugar: Why not M18?

M:  See variation.  Basically, white gets a tiny base, and black solidifies the corner and gets outside influence.  N16 keeps black low, and white keeps the
 influence.];B[ob];W[lb];B[na];W[ke];B[kd]C[M:  Before you make a move, consider what it gives you...and what it gives your opponent.  Was this move worth making?]
;W[ld];B[ie];W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[he];W[ge];B[gf]
(;W[ff];B[gg]C[Dlugar: Is the energy I'm spending here worth it or is it better spent 
elsewhere?

M:  White has a pretty big corner, though the wall is thin and the corner itself can be taken via ko.  Black isn't getting much, so from that standpoint, the energy is better spent elsewhere.  Black would have had to have made that decision before playing J17, however.]
;W[co];B[eq];W[ep]C[M:  I prefer D2 to E4.];B[fq];W[fp];B[gq]
;W[gp];B[hp]C[M:  White gave away a lot here.];W[ho];B[ip]C[M:  White has a few good options here.]

(;W[em]C[M:  Black is back in the game.  The bottom is nice territory.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]
(;W[ek]C[M:  This move is on the wrong side.  The proper way to use a wall is to force your opponent into it -- not to try to build territory directly.]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[fi];W[fk]C[M:  Note how little white got in that exchange.  The left side is still no man's land, and there is very little territory between the two white walls.]

(;B[ei]C[Dlugar: Is there a stronger move here?  

M;  I like G11 and E12.  Both help the connection with the G13 group.]

(;W[in]C[M:  Too small.];B[dk]C[M:  This is a mistake.  What happens if white plays something like J13?  The center and right side could become very large.]
