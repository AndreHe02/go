C[I am playing white in this game. As is typical, I came through fuseki in relatively decent shape, I thought. Then, I went south big time.

I seem to be having signficant issues with middle game strategy, and this is where I am hoping for the most feedback.

Thanks,

Jason

Brodie:  Hi!  I'm your reviewer! This is my first  review, for GTL anyway, so if I don't describe points properly, just let me know!]

;B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[aq];W[jq]C[Brodie:  I think you handled this quite well!]
;B[cs]
(;W[ds]C[Brodie:  D1 is very small.  It's only worth 1 point, and there is no threat to you there!]
;B[bs];W[mq];B[nq];W[hq]C[Brodie: This move seems fine as well, putting more pressure on the black stone.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[di]C[Brodie:  Your last few plays were all fine, quite efficient, taking most of the left side.  It still has one weakness at D8 and 9, but you're doing well at this point.]
;B[jd];W[pj];B[pk]C[Brodie:  Black uses a lot of contact plays, which isn't very common in circumstances like this.  R7 and 8 would be more usual.  At the same time, I'm not entirely sure how best to exploit it.  It's not a terribly bad play; it just isn't usual.]
;W[pg]C[Brodie:  I assume what you're trying to do is establish a bit of territory along the side so I think playing on the 3rd line- R13 would be a little better. 4th line is more for mapping out huge areas.]
;B[qg]C[Brodie:  Another contact play!];W[oj];B[pf];W[og];B[mh]
;W[ni]C[Brodie: this move works to make a more solid connection between your stones, but it's too passive.  I found that my mid-game skills improved considerably when I learned how to be extremely aggressive and stop worrying about things so much.]
;B[mi];W[mj]LB[pc:A][dk:E][hl:D][pm:C][qp:B]C[Was this move at all necessary??

This is the move that seems to me to mark the beginning of the end for me in this game - It's pretty much down hill from here...

What should have done instead? Even better, what should I be thinking about doing at a high level? Where should I be plotting central moyos, invasions and reductions?

It doesn't take a genius to see as they play through this game that I clearly have no idea.

Brodie:  It isn't necessary; I would choose a different move, such as P 14, P9 or R9, but it's certainly okay!  I don't see much wrong with it!  It also seems to work well with O11.  Also, it saves you from  having to fight to keep your white group alive, which is good.

   Globally speaking, black has mapped out a lot of territory at the top right and could easily take a lot of territory on the bottom right as well.  Invading the corners might be a good choice at this point.  (somewhere around Q17 or R4).  Also, Black hasn't really fortified the bottom right.  You can safely toss stones in around Q7 or R7. 

  I would invade and attack black groups now, but if you want to map out territory somewhere, H8 is a bold possibility.   Also, E9 would fortify your side very well.   There are a lot of options, and there usually is, you just have to make sure to make every stone count which is much easier said than done though!

 Personally, I think I would play around R7 or P17.];B[ji]
(;W[qj]C[Brodie: I don't like this play.  Again, it's passive,  and you're turning down a chance to start a fight!
(see variations)];B[qk];W[nk]TR[ok]C[Ah yes, more eyes, just in case I don't have enough already...

Brodie:  What about P9!  You can pressure the black group, and give your self more room for eyes!]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[ok];W[lj];B[jk]
(;W[ll]TR[rk]C[Brodie:  You shouldn't have any trouble making eyes!!  The corners could be invaded now! or how about S9.  If you want eyes so much, S9 is perfect.  Black can't answer S8 because of the possible cut at P8!  You could even choose to cut at P8 first, which might be even better. 
(I think the variations are a move back for some reason...)]
;B[nm];W[oi]C[Brodie:  weak and passive :-)   I think you're just filling in your own territory here.]
;B[ng];W[nh]C[Brodie:  timid again.  This protects one point of your territory, but instead you could take many points away from black.  Corner invasions are still an option! A play at P14 now would be better. You play it next, which is good, but the sooner the better!]
;B[mg];W[of];B[pe];W[oe];B[od];W[rk];B[rl]C[Brodie:  It's much less effective now because of the O7 stone.]
;W[ri];B[ln];W[jo];B[jn];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[qf];W[gp]C[I scared of the f3 stone for some unknown reason. My opponent has left it for dead, but I am evidently determined to make sure he understands just how dead this stone REALLY is.

Brodie:  It could still be a threat, but there's other ways of being cautious ^ -^  Maybe H6?  You could enlarge your own territory, and at the same time cut off any possible escape routes for the F3 stone.]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[en]C[It's not going anywhere now!!

Brodie: The F3 stone isn't going anywhere, but the two black stones did get somewhere though!! F3 wasn't THAT much of a threat, and you just let black start building a wall!]
;B[el];W[dl];B[ck];W[cl]C[Brodie:  don't like this terribly much.  I think it would be better to protect the upper side by playing C10 now.  Also, you could consider cutting the stone.  After you play C10, if black plays D9 you can still cut!  Cut EVERYTHING, that's the first step in learning to fight agressively.  :-)]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[ch]C[Brodie: lots of these sort of connections... I think C11 is better.  That way black can't atari the C10 stone.]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[bk];W[bl]C[Brodie:  I'd prefer B11.  How would you feel about black playing A13 here?]
;B[ek];W[bi];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[eg];B[ef];W[ee];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[fe]C[Black has gotten just a little too content in is domination of the board at this point, and I am able to make an incursion and reduce. However, watching me wage this attack is painful even for me. My play seems depressingly inefficient - like I'm just barfing stones onto the board with the philosophy of "Well if I can't have those points, neither can you."

Brodie:  Nothing wrong with reducing! But, yeah, some things could have gone better earlier]
;W[fi];B[ej];W[gh];B[fj];W[gj];B[gk];W[hi]C[Brodie This one seems less efficient I think.  I like H10 more or even H14.  Also you can still reduce black in other places, so you would want to do that before black defends them.  N15 and S7 are options!]
;B[hj];W[gi]C[Brodie:  this is small again, so it's best not to bother with it.  Simply let black capture, and extend farther into his territory. J13?]
;B[ij];W[hg];B[hf];W[ig];B[jg];W[if];B[ie];W[jf];B[kg];W[kf]
;B[lg];W[lf];B[ld];W[me];B[md];W[nd];B[le]C[Brodie:  black slips here! Black has to play O17.]

(;W[mf]C[Brodie:  completely unnecessary and you lose a huge opportunity! O17 is much better! It reduces black very much. (see variation)]
;B[nc];W[ne];B[qc];W[je]C[Brodie: it isn't agressive enough.  Black simply defends.  There was the forcing play at H15.  It's okay to make agressive cuts in your opponents territory; to capture you they have to fill in their own territory, so they don't gain any points on you!]
;B[he];W[gf];B[ge];W[gg]C[Now it gets really painful...

I am making moves that are so defensive and small, that again, it's painful even for me to watch...]
;B[kl];W[kk]C[Brodie:  Yeah, this is small.  You can still play R4 or maybe even S7!]
;B[jl];W[kj];B[jj];W[ih]C[Brodie:  R4 or S7 still];B[jh];W[em]
C[Certain I had some MUCH bigger move...

Brodie:  E7 was only worth one point!  Almost anything would be bigger.  R4 or S7!]
;B[fm];W[go]C[And again, wouldn't you think?

Brodie:  there's a proverb or rule against this one ;-) 

When you have two stone in a diagnal like G4 and H3, they're going to be connected for sure.  It's good shape.  If black was to cut you on one side, you would simple connect on the other side, and vice versa.  However, 3 stones forming a triangle like F4, F5, G5 are bad!  It's called an empty triangle, becuase there's no stone at F4. Since black hasn't played on either side, your extra stone at G5 is doing practically nothing!]
;B[ho];W[hp]C[And again?

Brodie:  the proverb still applies!  ^ _ ^];B[io];W[ip];B[ko]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[lp];B[mr];W[lq];B[lo]
(;W[lr]C[Brodie:  black has some weaknesses to exploit. You could have cut at O4 and O2]
;B[mm];W[mk]C[Brodie:  filling in your own territory??! O2, O4 R4, S7]

;W[ah];B[aj];W[bg];B[al];W[am];B[ak]C[Brodie:  One of the keys to learning how to fight, especially for the mid game, is to simply be agressive and cut EVERYTHING!  It's just end game left now, but you can still cut things, and you could invade the corner, it's worth a try!  Also, you can capture something in the middle for sure!]

;W[nj];B[ke];C[Brodie:  I think what you have to do more than anything is learn to be agressive! Don't take anything from anyone! Cut your opponents groups at almost every opportunity!!  Once you get the feel for being agressive and fighting you start improving.  Also, watch those small plays ;-)

Good luck playing go!])
