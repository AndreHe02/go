C[hello originat

my name is Sebastian, a 7kyu player on kgs.
I will try my best to answer your questions and hope it will help you.

My comments will start with "Seb:"

Variations without comments are only moves I thought about.

If you have any questions to this review, contact me per mail

(;B[jq]C[this turned out to be a mistake/ easy to pressure this new stone

Seb: you are right this is too near....];W[jp];B[iq];W[kp]C[Seb: after this your position is narrowly to the left while white has more potential here]
;B[nq]C[Seb: so you assessed the potential correct and felt you have to do something...]
;W[np];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[op]
(;B[kr]TR[nr][pr]C[Seb: This begs for a block here. this move is more like defending the left group but you should be aware of your marked weaknesses.]
;W[lr]C[L2 was an attempt to build the corner group using the threat to connect to other group. how should I have made it better because this didnt work well

Seb: Your attempt came from the wrong direction];B[mr];W[jr]

(;B[nl]C[this invation was made with a lot of stress. maybe it should have been on the third line?]
;W[ql];B[pf]TR[ni]C[I felt that I have to act fast against whites right side but q8 & o8 Im not sure if they where the best solution.

Seb: if you compare with the variations showed before q8 & o8 were not best. White has a good position on the right side.
He connected his groups.
With a move at triangle later he can force you to run out.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[og];B[nf];W[ef];B[gd];W[gf]
(;B[id]TR[dj]C[was it better to invade the left side now instead of j16?

Seb: Yes I think so. He would have been probably split the upper group into two, but both can live easily. The invasion is more important.
C10 is a huge move.];W[dj]C[this made me very stressed

Seb: yep ;) thats why you should have been played there. Then white would have felt this way ;)]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[dm];W[cn]TR[dk]C[Seb: Maybe D9 would have been a possible move. I think your group around F3 can live despite some pressure from above.]

(;B[dn];W[dl];B[em]C[very bad sequence. now I figured I lost the left side and generally I felt I will loose the game. I understood I better work to connect my new weak stones to the bottom left group]
;W[el];B[fm]C[Seb: right move here, F6 would have been wrong]
;W[ck];B[ep]TR[eo][fo][eq][fq]C[Seb: This move does nothing for you... the connection of this stones was already save (Bamboo)]
;W[fl];B[gm]C[Seb: again right desicion];W[pk];B[ok];W[pm]
(;B[ml]C[I was affraid to be to dense, I felt I have to run towards the center

C[I think now white felt he has secured his group but I still looked at it as if Im going to kill it

Seb: I dont think a kill is possible here. Your marked group is too weak.]

Try to keep sente. Your marked group could get in trouble];W[kl]

;W[jm];B[ll];W[km];B[jf]C[If this was played earlier I would have killed...]
;W[jh]C[now I knew I will get anything i want. there is no way white will lose this KO fight
