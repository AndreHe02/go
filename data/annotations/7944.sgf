C[forfun: Thanks for providing an interesting game.  It was fun to analyze.  I hope my comments make sense and can provide some food for thought.  In this game, I responded a lot in terms of Black's comments.  I found that they offered opportunities for me to say things that I very much wanted to say - very helpful! :-)

In particular, at 31 and again at 63 Black speculates that those stones are "overplays".  I thought that was interesting because it made me think, "What is an overplay?" My traditional thought was that an overplay was when I slammed down a stone thinking, "Take that you evil necromancer!" Meanwhile my opponent was thinking, "Oh, what a lovely target!" - and he was more right about it than I was. While analyzing this game I decided the situation is a little more complex than that.  See Black 31 for my thoughts. I now conclude that calling something an overplay is a barrier to improvement. It assigns a tright label to a deep learning opportunity.  So don't do it any more! :-)

In the beginning I think Black misjudged the overall balance.  However, once the fighting started, Black seemed to have a better overall feel for things.  This was most evident when Black surrounded the center, suddenly settling the game.  White displayed some nice ideas but was too ready to back away, make defensive plays, and wait to see how things would turn out.  Black would benefit from building strength 'before' invading so that those "overplays" become severe plays.]

;B[dm];W[jp]C[I believe this result is good for white, what could black do different?

forfun: Why do you believe it is better for White?  So far White has extended toward the top and built influence in the lower left, but has not closed the lower right corner.  How do you evaluate White's position?  It is natural that Black will invade next, dividing up the lower right.  White has given Black a lot of cash on the left for some potential in the lower right.  It does not seem to me that White can end that well here.]
(;B[op]C[forfun: This does not look like the best choice here.  The stone at K4 is waiting to block any development by Black.  Meanwhile, when White answers naturally at Q3, the fact that White did not enclose the lower right corner gets fixed naturally.  I see this as rather a mistake in direction by Black.  Black need not fear getting shut in because any resulting White position on the outside will tend to be shallow.  See the variations...]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[pp];B[oo];W[pn]C[forfun: White has secured the corner and raised the position on the right side in exchange for a 3-stone wall that has some difficulty efficiently securing itself.]
;B[lp]C[forfun: Way too narrow as an exchange for White's development on the right side.  The lack of a good follow up at this point is the real problem with P4.  Something similar would develop for almost any reasonable line of play after P4 because K4 was on the board.]
(;W[kr]C[forfun:  This is a little odd.  Since the left side is open at D2, the lower left is not very interesting for White.  Probably O7 would make better strategic sense.  White would try to force Black to strengthen the P4 group.  If White can strengthen the lower left White stone's in sente, it  would represent a good result for White.]
(;B[ho]C[This looks like overplay... is it?

forfun: Wrong question! :-)

What did you intend by this play during the game?  If you thought it was not an overplay at the time, what did you expect White's response to be? The question is not whether this was an overplay but rather - how did the game turn out different from your expectations?

We won't improve by learning to identify something as an overplay.  What we need to do instead is to improve our ability to anticipate the future course of play in a particular area.  Being an overplay is not a quality of a stone, rather it is a judgement about the result after we add another 5, 10, or 15 stones.  Looking back, how much of the result in the game followed your expectations at the time you played H5?]
;W[jn]C[forfun: This looks like the most natural reply, White accepts Black's invitation to split Black into two weak groups...]
;B[hl]C[forfun: Black lightly escapes.  But if Black has to play lightly here, what was the intention behind H5?]
(;W[hq]C[forfun: White kindly backs down.  This makes no sense in this position...]
;B[kq]C[forfun: A wise choice since White gives Black time to fix the weak stones.]
;W[jq];B[lr];W[fl]
(;B[gn]C[this looks like a mistake?

forfun: Agreed, Black "forces" White to take away a liberty on the Black stones to the left.  More fundamentally, after H3 the Black stone on H5 has become "light", Black should be happy to let White capture it in gote...]

;W[cm];B[dk];W[co];B[el];W[cn];B[dl];W[dr]C[White should have played at e3 here, biggest mistake of the game i think. 

forfun: This is a big loss for White but don't misunderstand the situation, Black's loss in the corner turned Black territory into White.  On the other hand, White's loss here turned neutral points into Black territory.  Despite D2, Black's loss in this area is about twice as large as White's.]

(;B[pk]C[another overplay?

forfun: Same answer as last time - what were you thinking here?  Right now the bottom side Black stones are not very weak, but they are not completely settled.  Black volunteers to add another weak stone nearby for White to attack. If White can engineer a double attack, the game becomes interesting... for White.]

forfun: If White can win the game with good yose, then the center is not big enough.  In that case, it is also not a "turn around" situation, rather Black must have played badly up to here since it is a lost game!

However, I agree with your original assessment, the center is more than enough to win the game. No further comments.]

(;B[nm]C[forfun: I think this is a better idea here. 

In one of his books, Yamashita Keigo wrote that we always have to consider the strength of stones, and:
- if our stones are weak, preserve the strength they have,
- if they are strong, push their stength hard,
- if the opponent's stones are weak, pressure them
- if they are strong, stay away from them. 

In this case, White has no obviously weak stones.  A longer range goal might be to invade the right side to try to separate the R11 stone from the bottom right and leave it weak.  But that is for the future. 

Meanwhile Black's only weak stones are in the bottom right.  After the last White play, the eye space is getting narrow along the bottom.  A White play next at O7 will both threaten the Black stones and strengthen the R11 stone.  Black should take this opportunity to do the opposite: strengthen his own stones while threatening R11.]
