C[Hello GTL, I have added some comments to the game the are in the format.
TheKid: <comment>

Regards,

;W[bo];B[hq]C[TheKid: I really struggle with this move, H3.  I feel it to be too slow, but I'm trying to play solid and patiently.  Was there anything else I could do?

Joseki is j3 instead of h3, but I think there's nothing wrong with h3, it's not as fast as h3 but more solid. Anyway, I don't think there's an alternative than playing an extension on the lower side, as a white pincer there would be really disagreeable.]

;W[qf]LB[fd:A][og:B]C[TheKid: I really want to play at A, but I think I needed B first.

Yes, it's a miai situation. I would also play B first.];B[og]
;W[qg];B[fd]C[as long as w answers as he did everything's fine as you can now play f16. And if he didn't you have a strong move at r13 which grants great influence to the lower side.]

(;B[ge]C[the cut is dangerous];W[ie];B[df]C[your basic idea is the same, but still the cut looks dangerous]

;B[gh];W[kc];B[lb];W[jd];B[ke];W[ci]C[very big point for both players. W has a lot of forcing moves  and bad shape can't be avoided]

(;B[fj];W[fi];B[eh];W[gi];B[fk];W[fh]C[TheKid: I did not see F12, but even so I think I got an OK result.]
;B[fg];W[dg];B[cj];W[dh];B[eg];W[ck];B[hi];W[nq];B[gj];W[qn]
;B[oo];W[kq];B[pl]C[Is this correct?  I'm trying a leaning attack, but don't know if Q8 is too far.]
;W[ii];B[jf];W[if]
(;B[ij];W[ki]C[TheKid: This part of the game is where I have the most trouble.  I know that I need to continue the attack on the white group, J11, but don't know how.  What will I get out from this attack?  How should I continue attacking, form which side, etc?

Here are my thoughts.  I think that from this attack I can get a good position to reduce the left side.  Also, I can get an attack on the lower two stones.  However, I need to make sure my upper group do not die.

Any suggestions on how to improve my attacking skills are greatly welcomed.

I think by attacking the lower stones later you won't gain very much. because, 3-3 is still open.]
;B[jj];W[lh];B[ji];W[jh];B[kg];W[kh];B[mg];W[lk]C[TheKid: At this point my two groups are alive, I'm satisfied, but how do I continue?

The problem is, with this direct attack you didn't gain much in this game because white has positions on the right as well as on the bottom, so there was no possibility to gain territory by attacking.]

;W[ml]C[Now I need to attack the lower group.  While all my groups are alive, I do know I'm falling behind on territory.

yes, the bottom right didn't go very well for you. w has his group settled, but you didnt gain much influence for attacking]

(;B[lm]C[if you want to keep on the attack you may try here. there are still chances white will die, but it's not very likely. but anyway, w has to answer, so I thin this is better than playing tenuki. you can still attack r6 when you gained some more strength.]
