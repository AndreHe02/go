C[I'll be reviewing both black and white.

Advice:

You need to do lots and lots and lots of tesuji tsumego problems and to review your basic shapes.  The main problem I saw in this game is that you are not very good with shapes and you tend to either have broken shape or have a total lack of liberties.  Better knowledge of shapes will make punishing mistakes much much easier.  I did not really see any strategy mistakes and really only one major direction mistake.  Aside from that, you need to be able to read better.

I have included variations with my reading and you'll see how many times white should have died outright  this game.

;B[cp];W[pp];B[eq];W[dd];B[pd];W[gq]C[This move is complete nonsense.  White is playing right next to black's strength and aims at c6 which doesn't do much right now.]
;B[cf]C[You ignored it, good.];W[df]LB[fc:A][fd:B]C[Very strange here, normally white would just answer at A or B.  This move makes Black strong.]

(;B[dj]LB[ch:A]C[This move leaves a weaknes at A.];W[cn]C[Wow, funny.  White is aiming at the sequence shown in the diagram.  However g3 is not settled and c6 has no nearby backup.]

C[This sequence was entirely too nice to white.  Plus this result is not good for b because he has a cutting point at A, and white e 14 stone is stunting your thickness.  On the upside g3 is in a silly place and white has not dealt with d 16.]

(;B[sp];W[sq];B[po];W[qs];B[sn];W[rr]SQ[ef]C[This was terrible for Black.  White made a basic joseki mistake and he instead killed you.  Learn the variation I showed you ;)

On the upside you have a lot of center influence and potential profit in the center.  Sadly the marked stone is limiting you but your position isn't hopeless.]

(;B[pl]C[extremely slow.];W[qf]C[Because of your slow move at q8 white gets to invade.]
