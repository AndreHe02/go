;B[qd]C[Hi, I am Dusan 2dan, my opponent is Keks 3dan.





Thanks to reviewer.





Hi, I am Thomson 6dan. I asked my teacher Mr. Morioka to help review your game. He is one of the strongest amateurs in Japan.]
;W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qo];B[qm];W[jp]LB[po:A][qp:B]C[Morioka: White 8 is unusual, but only a top professional could say if there was a problem with it. It seems fine to me.





Dusan: I think black A is big.


Thomson: The white stone is not dead, and Black's wall will not work well with the white stone at 8. Maybe black B would be better.]
;B[po]
(;W[jd]LB[ci:A]C[Dusan: What should I play now? Maybe splitting at A.





Thomson: It's hard to say what move is best. Anyway the actual game was almost the same. If I was White, I would have played at A instead of 10.





Morioka: It's a matter of personal taste. There is no correct answer for these moves.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ci];W[ck];B[ef];W[gd];B[cq]C[Morioka: Black 17 is bad. It gives White a thick position and an easy game. Also, the exchange of 15 and 16 was preparation for 17, so depending on Black's choice of move this exchange may not be needed.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[cn];W[do];B[bm];W[dn];B[an]
;W[cm];B[bn];W[pp]C[Dusan: I didnt like black A because of his stone at 8.





Morioka: White 30 is a big mistake! The ladder is blocked by black 15, because White waited too long to play here.]
;B[qp];W[op];B[oq];W[qq];B[rp];W[qr];B[nq]C[Morioka: Hey, Black 37 threatens a ladder! These guys are pretty strong. I've heard there are really strong players in Yugoslavia.]
;W[np];B[mp];W[no]C[Morioka: Jumping is proper shape here.]
;B[ro];W[mq];B[mo];W[nn];B[mr]C[Thomson: The exchange of 43 and 44 seems like a loss for Black.





Morioka: When he did that, I expected him to play a different move than 45. The two moves are a contradiction.]
;W[lq];B[pr]C[Thomson: Black should crawl once more to reduce White's territory before blocking. These small places make a big difference to your game.]
;W[os];B[nr];W[lr];B[rr];W[mn];B[lc]C[Dusan: Where should this move be? 





Morioka: Your move was fine.]
(;W[le]C[Morioka: This move is bad. It doesn't make territory, it doesn't reduce Black's territory, and it doesn't attack Black.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
(;W[cl]C[Morioka: This move is bad. It is trying to attack the black group above, but defending the white territory below is much more important. Also, I wouldn't want to play it because it makes white 14 look misplaced.]
;B[fr]C[Thomson: White's slack move gave Black a chance to invade. I have left out the moves after this.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[ob];B[nc];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[nb];W[oa];B[qa]
;W[ra];B[rb];W[sb]C[Thomson: This corner position can be invaded. If Black refuses to allow his stone on the left to be cut off, the corner becomes ko. So Black needs to consider how to defend this as the game proceeds.]
)
(;W[em]C[Morioka: This is the best way to defend the white territory.





Thomson: Oh, this leaves White a chance to block on the left later.]
))
(;W[nd];B[nc];W[qe]C[Morioka: This is the way to reduce Black's territory.]
))
(;W[pp];B[op];W[qp];B[pn];W[qq];B[or];W[qr]TR[jp]C[Thomson: White lives in the corner, leaving a cutting point on the outside. The marked white stone is in an ideal place.]
)
(;AE[po];B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[on];B[lp];W[pl];B[qj];W[ql]C[This way seems better. Black makes corner territory, gets a free move on the right side, and now the white stone is in the wrong place.]
