C[s> hi, this is siegoman, thank you for the chance to review your game,  my comments are marked with s>

In the next frame I list move numbers that were significant to me.

In general I think not enough priority was places on the long range goals.  Here are the clues:

- Sacrifices.  
If you want good long range results you need to sacrifice some short term stuff, such as a stone or two, even a group.  Not all stones are going to live, sac a few to get a good result!  As you threaten to save them your territory will increase.

- Multiple threats from a single stone.  
In the first 70 moves or so look for those moves that threaten more than one thing.  The other guy cannot defend both things, sure it may be more fun to force the direction of  your opponent, but isn't a nice subtle attack so much more clever than brute force?  Look at some high ranking handicap games, the guy with the dis-advantage has to threaten multiple things all the time, to have one stone act as two or three.

- Close plays. 
Avoid contact plays unless you are ok with the guy getting strong.  When defending go for contact, when attacking go for a bit of distance.

- Ko threats.  
Several times black played ko fight types of moves, but the timing was off.  And then the one chance where it would have helped ( 231 ) he missed it.]
;B[pd]C[Dear reviewer. Thank you very much in advance for reviewing this game. I am white in this game and I lost by a few points.

s> here are the moves that caught my eye:

28 - defend a cutting point

77 - look for how to cut a group directly or use a squeeze to cut

119 - attacking a group from one side often push it to get stronger on the other side.

142 - threaten two things at the same time.  let the guy defend the immediate threat while you get  the bigger pay off.

188 - excellent play! the large group is dead.

192 - play it safe or attack the invading group

194 - take a chance, solidify and attack.

239 - prevent the group from forming two eyes.

244 - defend on the weaker side.

248 - remove all chances of two eyes.];W[cd]C[s> I have heard it spoken that a stone on the third line best not face an opponents stone.  Here C16 faces Q16.  I think the reasoning is that black may play E16 and draw back to K17 as shown.]
