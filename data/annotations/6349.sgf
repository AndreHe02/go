AB[pd][dp][pp]C[This was a game played on DGS when I was 11 kyu and my opponent 14 kyu (thus the three stone handicap).  The ranks above were the ranks after the game.

I eventually resign the game with too many weak groups.  I'd like some feedback on my opening.  I spend a lot of time in the upper left, perhaps to my detriment.]

(;W[eh]C[This is too slow.  Black should now play K4 or H17 and white is way behind in the moyo race.  

White will invariably leave weaknesses behind in a handicap game, so leaving C12 weak at this point is not terrible.]
;B[cc]C[This is black's first mistake.  The timing of this move is bad as there are bigger moves available, like H17 and K4.  More importantly, the sequences that follows gives white exactly what he needs in this game, thickness.  It is more common for black to develop thickness early on, so helping white build it now will help white to recoup the handicap stones.]

(;W[pb]C[This is very bad.  It is low, on the 2nd line.  Also, the potential for invading at the 3x3 point, R17, is erased, and that could be worth 20 plus points later on.

(;W[ld]C[Joseki are not always applicable to the whole board situation.  Neither M16 or L17 adequately use the white thickness on the left.  See variation.

M16 does a reasonable job of working with the F16 stones, but white has better.]
;B[id]
(;W[mf]C[J16 is an invasion.  It is alone against 3 stones to the right and 9 very strong stones to the left.  Attack the invading stone.  

N14 seems to be trying to secure the O17 stones from the threat of J16, but they are not under attack.  J16 is.

See variations];B[kc]
(;W[hc]C[With N14 in place, the cap at K14 is better.  To kill something, you must first contain it, so repventing center access is more important than making eye space reducing moves.  In addition, a moe like K14 provides a loose connection between your strong F16 group and the M16 group, which later on would have been helpful.]
;B[hd]
(;W[gc];B[if];W[jq]C[It is debatable whether white should leave off the attack on J14 for now, or not.  Black is not out of danger yet, but there are other things for white to do, like the move you played.  

White should be aiming to exploit the weakness of the J14 group on a large scale by creating thickness around the F6 area, so that white can "push" the J14 group towards it, and hopefully kill.]

C[The timing of this is questionable.  The process of making life in the corner will strengthen black in the surrounding area, which will put more pressure on the K3 group.  The K3 group is not alive yet, so helping black build strength near it is probably not a great idea.  

Perhaps a move like M8, and sequence aiming for another eye in the center should come first.]

(;W[qo];B[po];W[rq]C[Now black recognizes the threat R5 poses, so he captures it.  Part of the advantage white has in a handi game is that black does not always see everything that white sees, so helping black to see the bad things you can do to him gives away some of yoru advantage.]
;B[qn]
(;W[no]C[As you have noted, living is more important here.  Plainly the points involved here, roughly 30, make it clear that white should just live with Q2 instead of O5.  

Another way to see this is that O5 seeks to save the cutting stone P4.  Saving P4 lets white attack the O3 group.  However, once black plays Q2, the O3 group is alive, so the cutting stone P4 no longer has any influence on the situation.  Saving it becomes pointless.  By this logic, making life with Q2 actually makes the cutting P4 a meaningful cutting stone in addition to making life in the corner.  
  
Further, the fact white can save the P4 stone makes Q2 sente for white.  White first lives in the corner, and then retains sente if black fixes at O5, or if black does not fix, white gets a great attack against the O3 stones by playing O5 himself.]
;B[pr]C[White's corner dies here.  I don't believe there is even a ko for life available here.]
;W[qr];B[os]
(;W[lr]C[This is correct.  White has died in the corner, and has no reason to play there any longer.  Ensuring life for the K3 group is more important.

I should stress that this is not an attack on the O3 stones.  White can't even win a capturing race: the O3 group has 6 liberties and an eye while and R3 has 4 liberties and a potential eye.  Hence, O3 are too strong to be attacked.]
;B[sr]C[Now I've lost that corner.  

The corner was lost with bQ2.  Black is in fact wasting a move here.]
;W[qb]C[Making eye shape for this group is important, but if you manage to kill the J16 group, making eye shape would be ultimately useless.  An attack at J12 seems to be a better way for white to proceed here.]

(;W[ff]C[The wrong direction.  White has many stone around here, and they are pretty strong.  White can afford to be aggressive.  
see variation];B[gg];W[eg]C[This is a very meek way to proceed.  Black has all but connected J14 F13 and H9 together.   It is always harder to attack connected groups.  

 Protecting ones established territory is important, but White does not have enough territory to make simply guarding it a viable strategy.  White should pursue an attack as outlined in the recent variations.]
;B[le];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[kg];W[hg];B[hh];W[hf]C[G12 and H14 are miai, moves that are paired.  If black cuts at H14, white can connect again with G12.  If black saves his stones with G12, then white can connect with H14.  White need play neither as no matter what black does, white has the other to fall back on.  White can press the attack here instead of meekly connecting.]
;B[ih]C[Black's groups are all connected now, and white no longer has an attack on either.  In fact, the one under attack now is white.  O17 is not for sure alive yet, and K3 seems to need another move.

Attacking the weak black groups helped to strengthen all the white groups around them, especially if you end up killing one.]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[nl]C[A wasted move.  White should not hope to connect the L5 group to the O17 group.  White also has no prospects for territory around O8.  This move is almost a pass by white.  

White has some aji (potential) around R9 that O8 could help to exploit, but the continuation is long and comlicated.  A move like S12 clearly threatens another move against the black R17 group, and so as an end game move, it is likely a better move as it is sente.]
;B[nm];W[ml];B[kk];W[jh]C[The ladder might favour white, but ladders aren't the only way to capture.  Black is clearly storng here, so white can be captured in a net pretty easily.  This will end up as a donation to black.]

;B[rh]C[All the moves since O8 to here have been smaller than S12.  Both players have missed this important point till now.  

An attack on the black R17 group could probably be used to help the white O17 group live, so white has not only given black many points, but missed an opportunity to live for sure with O3.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[pl];W[ok]C[This is just points now.  White has connected O17 to K3 through the middle, and each group has one eye, so together they are alive.  P9 is just a waste of sente to gain about 5 points.  

If C3 works as an invasion, it would surely be worth more than 5points, and there are other moves besides for white.]
;B[bi]
(;W[cp]C[I tried connecting rather than use the 3-3 invasion.  I don't know what's better here.

The attachment here does not work, black is too strong there.  Attachment stones are akways at a disadvantage in terms of liberties, so invasions usually do not involve attachments, unless you plan to sacrifice the attaching stone.

Overall, white played too timidly.  By this I mean, white played too many purely defensive moves, did not try to make large moyos where possible, and did not try to attack weak black groups.  Timid play is bad in general, but it is especially bad for white in a handicap game.  

The basic ideas of attack are things you are familair with already, but your familiarity is on a smaller scale, that or individual stones.  To kill individual stones, you need to cut them off from other stones, and surround them.  The same is true of large collections of stones or groups.  Attacking consists of seperating groups from one another, and trapping those groups in a ring of your stones. 

Of course, you can not always kill the group you have trapped, but the process of trapping and almost killing can be beneficial for you as well.  The player that surrounds an opponent group, and forces it to live develops thickness during the exchange of moves required for the opponent to live.  As an example of this principle, just look at the C17 invasion by black.  White developed a large thick wall of stones.

The moral here is that to win one must attack the weak groups of the opponent, and manage the attacks against your own weak groups so that the opponent does not benefit too much.  Reading about attack and defense would be useful for you I think.  I know of two english books on the subject; Kato's Attack and Kill by Kato Masao, and Attack and Defense by James Davies.

Finally, remember that when playing white in a handicap game, black is more afraid of you and the strange tricks you can play than you are of his handicap stones :)]
