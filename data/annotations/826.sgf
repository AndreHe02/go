C[no2k: In this game where i played white, i wanted to play more solidly. So i preferred defensive moves. But actually there was not enough territory at last.

Jared: This is a no komi game, so white would usually anticipate playing more agressively than usual. However, against certain brash opponents, a defensive style might be effective.]
V[0];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[qp];B[ce];W[po]MA[np]C[no2k: too slow?

Jared: Not necessarily. A professional would probably say too slow. But the choice of joseki here is not going to make or break a game between kyus. I do not like white 6 because the pressing move (X) neither flattens out a black moyo, nor expands a white one. So white has no really nice followup. Similarly, a black play at 6 is not urgent. So this area is cooler now than the upper left corner.]
;B[ed]MA[dc]C[Black 7 should be at X. White 8 erases the influence of the black shimari. The corner is not secure and can be invaded or reduced.]
;W[dj]MA[cm][cn]C[no2k: I didn't want having black this point.

Jared: White 8 is probably better at one of the two marked points. Do not approach strength.]
;B[qj];W[kp]MA[kq][lq]TR[dj][dp]C[The white pincer at one of the marked points is more severe. But white 10 works well in combination with the triangled stones.]
;B[fp];W[eq]C[no2k: I hoped for b.

Jared: Hoping is not an effective strategy in Go. This is why white 12 is a bad move. It should be at a.]

(;B[dn]C[Jared: This is a tough position for white. "b" might be playable.]

(;W[cn]C[Jared: Black 15 should be at b.]
(;B[co];W[do];B[cm];W[bn]C[Black 19 should be at b, which is sente against the two white stones. It is also more solid.]

(;B[en]TR[dj]C[no2k: Now my marked stone didn't look happy, but i can handle him lightly.

Jared: The white stone is pretty light. A white play at b is urgent now.]

(;W[fq]
(;B[gq]C[Black 21 should be at a.];W[gp]C[no2k: I thought i have to cut here. I didn't want black to connect.

Jared: White 22 is an excellent move.];B[hq]C[White 24 must be at b or c. See variations after b. "c" seems best.]

(;W[fo]C[no2k: I wanted to have my position completely secure. I feared something as in the variation.

Jared: If you are cowering in the corners, you have no business taking white. Demote yourself now to 9 kyu, and do not call yourself an 8 kyu again until you are ready to fight.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[io]
(;W[bm]C[no2k: I wanted to prevent black having a stone there as in the variation.

(;W[ci]C[no2k: Is this move reasonable?

Jared: No, it should be at a. As the variations show, black comes out better after cutting in every case.]
;B[di];W[ej];B[ch];W[bi]C[Jared: black b is urgent.]
(;B[fm]C[no2k: I would have prefered something as in the variation for black.]

(;W[dm]TR[bi][ci][cj][cl][dk][cm][dn][en][fm]C[Jared: black b is urgent. White should have rescued the marked white stones rather than play 40. This sets all seven of the marked black stones adrift, rather than just three.]

(;B[oo]MA[bj]C[Jared: obviously, black 41 is in outer space, and should be at X. White 42 should be at b or c.]

(;W[kn]C[Jared: black 43 is terrible shape. b is better.]
(;B[hn];W[ql]C[Jared: obviously, white 44 is off the vital point.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[pp];W[qo];B[qq];W[np];B[op];W[gm]C[no2k: Instead of that i would prefer playing at b now.

(;B[hl]C[no2k: Far better is b.

Jared: You are kidding, right?]
(;W[rq]C[no2k: It is slow, but secure this group completely.

Jared: white 64 was urgent.];B[gk]MA[kl][kd][bj]C[Jared: Black is playing a series of aimless moves. Any of the X moves are bigger.]
;W[em]C[no2k: Obviously that isn't necessary.];B[hc];W[nn]C[no2k: This and the following moves did not work well. There must be a way to handle the stones more effective, but i don't know how. My intention was to strengthen these stones, then attack the black stones at the left of them.

Jared: white has no attack. white should be thinking about light play, reducing and surviving. The black stones are very strong.]

[kl][kk][ik][jj][ji][hi][gh]C[no2k: That was a simple misreading. I was aiming at the cut at a.

Jared: there is no cut at a. black is perfectly happy to abandon the three marked black stones if necessary, particularly because this probably kills the marked white stones.]
