AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi! In general I think the game is not bad at all for Black. There are some overly cautious and inefficient moves but the only problem is the mistake at the end where the group is lost. Otherwise Black would have probably won. Anyway, let's get going...

(;B[qj]LB[oe:B][qj:A]C[Up to here everything is completly normal. I don't know who marked the alternative move P16 here, but it is indeed a good move to consider and maybe somewhat urgent.]
(;W[ch]LB[oe:B][ch:A]C[Yes, again P15 would be good for White as well.]
;B[ck]C[Good! But P15 would actually now really be good for Black.]
;W[bp]C[Not sure here. White should probably go for 3-3.];B[cq]
C[Good! Now Black secures the corner and White's situation hasn't improved all that much.]
;W[db];B[cc]C[Same.];W[qc]LB[oe:A]C[Almost good for Black. P15 instead seems more severe.]
;B[oe]LB[rb:A][md:B][pg:C]C[When I was about your level I was scared but the fact that now White can connect both sides by playing 2-2 (S18) next. But actually that would still give Black an acceptable result as White has invested more in that corner and Black can go for influence by pressing White down at N16 or Q13 next.]
;W[lq];B[jo];W[mo];B[pm]C[The game is still excellent for Black.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[rp]
(;B[rq]C[Here, 3-3 for Black seems a little better. That would keep White very busy as he has to take care of both groups (see variation).]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[rr];B[ro];W[sq];B[qo];W[pq]C[White settles a little to easily here, and the compensation for Black is ok for a handicap game, but not for an even game. On the positive side, anything that simplifies the game is obviously good for Black.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[pf]LB[me:A]C[A little slow. N15 would be more active.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi];B[ph]C[This is the first move that I would consider to be very bad. Does not help Black at all and takes away options for later. Just play whatever you want to play afterwards without this exchange.]
;W[qi];B[je]C[OK.];W[hc];B[le]LB[mi:A]C[Again a little slow. I think you can severly attack White's group on the right, for example with N11. Clearly White has more problems than you have.]
;W[eh];B[ek];W[bq];B[cr]LB[br:A]C[B2 is possible and better.]
;W[hq];B[go];W[oj];B[pk];W[lj];B[jl]C[It's becoming increasingly clear that your game needs to be more active. If you answer every move by White you cannot win. White manages to settle all his weak groups in sente, that must not happen. If White settles one group you attack another group, that is the way to victory.]
;W[kn];B[jn]LB[ll:A]C[Here for example you must prevent White from easily connecting. Hence for example M8 would be a good alternative. Your stones are in no danger.]
;W[ml];B[en]C[Not bad, B2 is good now to kill.];W[jr];B[kr]
;W[kq];B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hp]C[Good. Connection wasn't so easy after all :-).]
;W[hr];B[js];W[kp];B[io];W[gg];B[dg]C[Not necessary, doesn't help Black at all.]
;W[dh];B[cb]LB[fd:A][gd:B][ge:C]C[I'm a fan of solid moves that gain points in addition. So I like this sort of move. However, again to prevent White from easily connecting his groups a move in the region of G15 would also be conceivable.]
;W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe]C[This is too easy for White.]
;B[gj]LB[br:A]C[No, Black should kill with B2.];W[jg];B[lg]
;W[ki];B[bk]LB[br:A]C[Finally you ignore a White move :-). Still, B2 is good.]
;W[dl]
(;B[fj]LB[dk:A][cm:B]C[No, no, no. Big mistake. Connection is the only option here. You can fight there, no problem. If you connect D9 you have moves like C7 later on. Again, White has more problems than you have.]
;W[bm];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[el];W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[ci]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[ak];B[di]C[Big disaster! And on top of that sente for White.]
;W[kd];B[jd]C[Good side!];W[ke];B[kf];W[ld];B[me];W[lb];B[jf]
;W[nf];B[ng]LB[ne:A]C[A simple connection would be ok, I think.]
;W[mf];B[ne];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[og];W[lh];B[mi];W[rf];B[se]
C[Not absolutely necessary as both White groups are alive.]
;W[od];B[rg];W[qg];B[rj];W[rh];B[jh];W[ig];B[kh];W[li];B[kg]
C[Good escape.];W[mj];B[lf]C[White cannot play here now.];W[ni]
;B[ji];W[mh]C[Slow for White];B[nm];W[mm];B[lr]C[This is big. Black has two eyes and doesn't need to capturethe H3 group any more.]
;W[mr];B[ls];W[ko];B[km];W[dc];B[ed];W[bf];B[bg]C[Very complicated.]
(;W[cg]C[It seems B12 is better for White (see variation).]
;B[bh];W[df];B[ce]C[The result is great for Black.];W[so];B[sn]
LB[rn:A]C[The losing move. If you play S6 instead, nothing will happen. It seems Black is at least 20 points ahead, so you would win for sure. There are no big uncertainties any more.]
;W[rn];B[sp];W[hs];B[is];W[so];B[pn];W[sm];B[ql];W[op];B[nn]
;W[po];B[no];W[rk];B[rl];W[sl];B[sk];W[sj];B[si];W[sk];B[sf]
;W[sg]C[Well then, not a bad game at all. Really only the end and the little disaster on the left. Otherwise your game is very solid, sometimes a little overly so. If in some area you have many more stones than your opponent you welcome a fight. If you have fewer stones you play lightly and avoid fights. Ok, I hope this was a little helpful. Do not hesitate to ask questions! Good luck!
