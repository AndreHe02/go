C[Hello,
In this game I'm Eranorn (White).
This days I'm always white on KGS and I don't understand why
:D
Well, my opponent made a san-ren-sei and I don't feel comfortable
with it
as I like to play it when I'm Black.
We played something in the lower right that didn't look like
a joseki, and I would like to have some comments on it.
I lost by 7,5 points, and I really wish to know what I could
have done better, as I haven't improved for a while !

Thanks a lot for the comment,
Mathieu

Went over the game. I hope the review is usefull for you.
There are, I think, 2 points you should pay attention to:
- do not follow blindly black moves but see if it is needed to answer or whether there is an alternative,
- when you play a move (e.g. move 56), count the score and then determine the best way to go forward.]

(;W[qn]LB[no:B][qq:A]C[* Problem of this move is that one of the 2 stones will be captured
by Black. Better is to either live in the corner (A) or get out
(B).]

(;W[mp]C[If you want to play 3-3 omit this move. You have a few different
scenarios then.];B[mq];W[qq];B[qp];W[op];B[no]LB[oo:A][pq:B]

(;W[oo];B[pq]LB[nn:A][oq:B]C[Eranorn : Here is the move I didn't know how to deal with.]

(;W[nn];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[oq];B[qr];W[ql]LB[qf:B][rj:A]C[Eranorn : Hmmm... Bad isn't it ? Did I lose a move in here, or
was it just wrong ?

I think N4 was the move that was wrong. This move is not too
bad since it gives you a change to slide to A or even do a pincher
at B. You also have a group in the area where black thought his
influence would be.];B[fq]LB[cm:A][fp:B]C[Eranorn : Of course...]

(;W[cm]C[I do not like this move. The left side is the part of the board
where you should make your points, this is a move on the 3rd
line and makes it difficult to make a moyo. This move does not
force black to answer and white can play first around C14.]
;B[cf];W[ci]LB[bc:A][cc:B]
(;B[bc]LB[cc:A]C[Black should play at A.];W[gc]LB[nc:A][qf:B]
C[Eranorn : I think it is too small too, right ?

Yes, move is not urgent, leave it as is and Play A or B.];B[dr]
LB[fp:B][cq:A]
(;W[cq]LB[fp:A]C[Too passive, you are following, better to play A.]
;B[fn];W[fp]C[Eranorn : Not a good idea... I just strengen his stones

No I think you can cut of the white stone, black played the stone
one too far.];B[gp];W[fo];B[go]LB[en:A][gn:B]
(;W[en]LB[gn:A]C[This move should be at A];B[fm];W[ln];B[kn]
;W[ko]LB[km:A]C[Better omit this move and play A directly.]
;B[lp];W[km];B[jn];W[ll]LB[pj:D][km:C][ln:A][ko:B]C[Eranorn : Necessary ? Or to small too ?

This move is the resukt of playing at A b and C. However with
this move it is possilbe now to play around D and attack the
black stone at D.];B[ic]C[Eranorn : Here is really a big point, isn't it ?]
;W[qf]C[Good.];B[pg]LB[qc:A][oe:B][pf:C]
(;W[qc]LB[oe:B][pf:A]C[Better to get out by A or B.];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pf];W[qe];B[pe]LB[jb:B][jd:C][lj:A]
(;W[lj]LB[jb:A][jd:B]C[Eranorn : Hmmm... But couldn't pincer around L17...

White is alive with this group, this move does not do much. If
you want to invade A, or B might be an option.

At this point you should also count, because this will influence
how far to go into blacks moyo.

Black:
Left: 6 
bottom: 30
right corner: 9
Top: 20
65 points
White: 
top right: 10
top left: 4
right/centre: 10
left: 20
44 points.

So you'r about 15 points ahead and then 56 is too slow.];B[if]
LB[bb:B][cc:C][bd:D][cd:A][ie:A]C[Should be at A. This puts more pressure on the white group and
J18 is no monger possible.]
(;W[cd]LB[bb:A][cc:B][bd:C]C[This move is not good, you should try to get a living group as
soon as possible. A, B or C are better.];B[bd]C[Eranorn : Probably useless :)]
;W[id]C[Eranorn : I wanna try this.

It worked out quite well. Even M10 is now perfectly placed.]

LB[qg:A][qh:B][rh:C][cr:D]C[Eranorn : Another odd move.

A, B, C or D are better. D probably best, is worth at least 10
points.];B[qg];W[rg]C[You are following black again,  Q18 is bigger.
Also because the right side is open and black will never be able
to get many points here.];B[rh];W[rf];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[ra]
C[This is also why playing yourself Q18 was better, black played
on both ends of your group and got both of the bigger points
as well.];B[cr]C[Big, after this move black is well ahead.

Black app. 65 points, white 45 points (without the komi).];W[eq]

;W[dk];B[bh];W[cj];B[cb];W[db];B[ro]LB[rq:A]C[This was sente for you (if black does not answer, white A and
the corner is almost dead). So black should never have got the
