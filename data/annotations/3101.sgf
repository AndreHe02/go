C[smat [8k\]: Hi
neoKupo [9k\]: enjoy

I tried really hard to take this game seriously, and I struggled in trying to think of why I should move places.  I'll try to explain how I was thinking.  Please rip my thinking apart, as well as the moves

crux: Hi, my name is Bernd; I'm 1dan.  I hope this review will be useful.  There are some variations, so please use a sgf reader that displays them well.  I recommend qgo, ggo or jago; cgoban2 has some problems.]
;B[qe];W[dp];B[nq]C[Both of my first moves were attempts to get the opponent to invade, that was what I wanted.

crux: Hmm, that sounds like a rather vague plan, but there's nothing wrong with experimenting.]
;W[dd];B[fq]C[This seemed the best move, as I was still wanting the invasions to occur]
;W[pp];B[qq]LB[qn:A]C[crux: Playable, but a second approach move at A is maybe more common.]
;W[pq]
(;B[qn]C[crux: Very odd.  See variation for the standard joseki.]

(;W[pn]C[I was going for a trick play here in the variation, but I got into too much trouble

crux: I don't see how Black can get a good result out of this "trick".]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[qm];W[qr]
(;B[pm]LB[rr:A]C[I played this move hastily, without thinking

crux: Thinking purely locally this move seems like a nice point, but for the moment Black should probably hane at S2 (A) to deny White an easy life in the corner and to ensure his own stones are settled.  After that it is becoming urgent to make a base for the O3 stone - with three stones on the lower side, Black would have nothing to fear from the white wall.  Another point to consider here is that the wall still lacks eye potential; if you deny it any target for attack, White will find it harder to settle it.]
;W[rr]C[smat [8k\]: are u there?
neoKupo [9k\]: yes];B[dn]TR[nq]LB[cn:E][hc:F][nn:A][no:B][pi:D]
[qi:C]C[I deliberated a lot on this move, thinking of moves also at the marks, F was to work with a pincer, and to attempt to confuse the opponent

crux: Don't play inferior moves trying to confuse the opponent.  It's not the way to get strong at this game. In my eyes, the most important area is still the lower right corner.  Black's marked stone is very close to what is now becoming white strength.  Black's right side group doesn't clearly have eyes yet either.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq]C[I know some regular sequences for this position, but I've never seen one for this, so I went for it.]
;W[eq];B[cp];W[gq]TR[dp][eq][fo][fp]C[crux: This looks like a sensible result in the corner.
Note that the marked white stones are now strong.  The two black stones glued to it are now almost meaningless.  They have some aji, but trying to move out with them immediately as you did in the game is not a good idea.  "Play away from strength", "Keep forcing moves in reserve".]

(;B[hq];W[gr];B[jq]C[lure play so I could build shape for my group

crux: The result from all this is that White has been solidified even more, and Black still has a dodgy shape.  This was to be expected.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[go];B[nn]C[I didn't like O5 so i went with this]
;W[no]C[crux: White helps Black strengthen his stones.];B[mo]
;W[np];B[mp];W[mn];B[ln]C[I was maybe too concerned with my bottom middle group, so i played this]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[nm]
(;B[in]C[cut block

crux: What cut? Black's group has a viable if not exactly stellar shape, so it's time to turn elsewhere (or, if you really feel you need to move out into the center, a play around M9 would be quicker).  If you're thinking about this move as making territory here, don't - the area is much too small for this stage of the game.]
;W[kd];B[oc]C[i still was inviting the invasion];W[oi]C[crux: A vague move, reducing nonexistant territory and building nothing for White.]
;B[qj];W[rp]C[crux: White is alive without this move, and Black's group isn't in danger, so this achieves little.]
;B[pi];W[ll]C[crux: Playing near both strong black and strong white stones.  White should play elsewhere.]
;B[ml];W[lo]
(;B[lp];W[ko];B[nl];W[on];B[om];W[nn]
(;B[kl];W[lk];B[jm]C[I didn't see the weakness of this

crux: It doesn't really have one.];W[kk]C[i felt a play elsewhere was more urgent]

(;B[fd]LB[cf:A][fd:B]C[i couldn't find a good play on the side, and i considered A, but if W extended, I felt it was unbearable.

crux: No reason to feel it would be unbearable.  I think a play at A would work better with Black's lower left corner. Even if White extends to F16 (B), the upper side is far from secure territory for him.]
;W[jn]
(;B[km]C[I even played this unaware of what was happening to me.]
;W[io];B[jo]C[i read this wrong];W[jp];B[kp];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr]
;B[kr]C[crux: This is a tricky life and death problem now.  I didn't manage to come to a conclusion whether White can kill or not.]
;W[df];B[id];W[nd];B[od];W[nf]
(;B[jk]TR[fd][id]C[in lack of a better move..

crux: Moving out a heavy clump of stones is usually not a good idea, but in this case you seem to have little choice - they are cutting stones after all, and the white stones on the right side are not strong and can be attacked. But remember that neither are your stones - and the two marked stones at the top are unsettled as well.  White could think about making a splitting attack.]
;W[mk]
(;B[cj]TR[fd][id][in][jk][jm][kl][km][lm][ln]C[crux: This move is offtopic.  There's a battle going on in the center.  You need to take care of your weak stones so you can put pressure on White.]

(;W[gk];B[jj];W[li]
(;B[cc]TR[fd][id]C[crux: A corner invasion like this risks severely weakening the marked stones.  It is a bit inconsistent with the original high approach move.  Also, what about your center stones?  Are they entirely out of trouble?]

(;W[dc]C[this went how i planned];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[dh];B[gl];W[hl];B[hk];W[il];B[gj];W[hn]C[i felt w was foolish for allowing me to get a ponnuki in such a vital area

crux: Yes, this could have ended very badly for Black.];B[fk]

;W[lc];B[jc];W[ld];B[gf];W[gg]
(;B[je]TR[cd][dc][dd][df][dh][eb][ec]C[i felt i could live, even though i didn't read it out.

crux: It looks dangerous.  I'd be worried about making eye shape very quickly.  But notice that the marked white stones also lack eye shape, so if you could cut them off from the others...]

(;W[kg];B[fg];W[ff];B[ge];W[fh];B[fe]C[i didn't have a good reason for playing this, it was too hasty]
;W[eg];B[gb]C[this looks weird to me, but it looked best];W[qf]
;B[re];W[qh];B[js]C[I didn't want to take the chance of letting this group die, and just because i didn't see a way to make it die, my opponent may have

crux: You have to trust your own reading.  If your opponent proves you wrong, you'll learn from the mistake.]
;W[pe];B[pd];W[qc];B[pb]C[i didn't read this out...but it looked best.  i think i was lucky]
;W[qd];B[rf];W[pf];B[rh];W[ri];B[rg];W[qi];B[qg];W[ph];B[pg]
C[i misread this cut

crux: Yes, you end up damaging your lower group and filling one of your own liberties.]
;W[og];B[rj];W[si];B[qb];W[rn];B[rm];W[so];B[oj]C[i couldn't find a way to make this live, and the final way of making it live i saw was misread]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[pi]LB[rk:A]C[crux: Difficult problem.  I think S9 (A) is the best chance to live.  You need a stronger player than me to decide this question, I changed my mind 7 times then gave up trying to decide whether it lives or dies.  Of course, White could have played there now instead of filling the meaningless ko.]

(;B[nj]C[this was hasty and greedy and was assuming that the group would live, as are many moves in this area]
