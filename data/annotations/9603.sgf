T : Jumping is very natural …];W[dn]LB[dl:2][fm:B][fn:A][hp:1]
C[

T : And here is the main move, if you only go out with A or B, white will stabilize himself easily with K3 and you will be the only one with troubles. Two continuations are 1 and 2.]

(;B[fm];W[jq];B[po];W[cf]
(;B[lc]C[I thought the top was getting too developable for white, so I invaded. I don't know if that was right or not.


T : Stragegically, the bottom is important here, White really wants to get N3 or/and D8 to have secure groups, so that Black E5 gets very weak. M17 is not a bad idea I think, but I would first either exchange M3 for K5 (or something similar), then attack with D8 maybe, or reinforce E5 first and then attack (see variations)]
