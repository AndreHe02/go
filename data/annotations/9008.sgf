C[Hello to my reviewer. I played white. I mostly have a few tactical questions related to the Lower Left corner invasion. However, I also feel like black didn't
push as hard as could have been. Where did I leave myself too open?  Was my treatment of the center too lax and uncocused?
Anything else you care to point out strategically and tactically would be greatly appreciated. A thousand thanks.]

C[This was probably negligent, but i think it's at least as big as attacking the LS group
--------------------
The LS group is pretty solid. What was played wasn't really a common joseki, but the dictionary i checked said tenuki is ok. This is a fine move]
;B[cm]C[Not an urgent approach, but it'll have to be dealth with eventually.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[qj]LB[jd:a][pj:b]C[Playing A allows B which is bad. I wanted to probe first. The UL should be solid enough to defend against moves around A.]

-----------------
doesn't really complish much. you'd be better of just playing elsewhere]

easier to read does not mean good. I would reccomend playing at a insteead]

;B[hf];W[fl]LB[gf:a]C[A is bigger I think, but during the game I had figured that the point of his maneuvering in the top would probably culminate in a left side attack. This seems to give me solidity on the left and connect however he aims to split me.
