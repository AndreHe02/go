>Hello and thank you for reviewing this game. 

About me (black): I've been trying to improve my fuseki, but I believe my major lost are between fuseki and middle game. I seem to find myself wondering where to play. 
Also, I tend to let this friend I'm playing with always develop a big moyo, so that was a concern of mine during the game. Probably too concerned about this and made me choose bad moves.

Any help would be appreciated!

[j\] Hi, Jamie here, reviewing your game [for black\].

On rereading your thoughts and looking at the game perhaps if you try to keep your goals, the purpose of each move, clearly in mind as you play your moves will be more effective. Also look for plays that do two things, messing with your opponent is much better when you are securing your groups at the same time.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]C[[j\] It makes me a little uncomfortable to see the bottom right corner unfinished.]
;W[cn]C[[j\] and this move chooses a sequence which typically leaves white with sente which is a good choice now.]
;B[jp];W[qn]C[[j\] and white achieves the goal of approaching your unfinished corner.]
;B[po]LB[qp:A][ql:B]C[[j\] Usually Q5 has meaning towards the left and right. Here, white's stone has already removed the potential to the right. While white does not handle this well later (and you get a good result) however either A (securing corner and side and threatening R6) or B (aiming for development on both sides of R6) feel more appropriate at the moment.]
;W[rp];B[ql]C[[j\] Seems like the right choice now.];W[qq];B[pn]
C[>I looked up after, Q4 is joseki, although I don't think Q6 gave a bad result.

[j\] Q6 lost you the bottom side later so not entirely good. I'd prefer Q4.]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[kc]LB[or:A][pb:B][qh:C][hq:D]C[>Up to here no problem. Now I start wondering what would be best next move.

[j\] There are a number of places where white might cause you some trouble. Try to fix a few in sente.

Looking at the whole board white has a good spread on the upper left half of the board, your stonesare over the lower right half but with a number of places open where white can effectively reduce.]
(;B[cf];W[di];B[fc]C[>Is 3-3 better here?

[j\] This play sacrifices a stone to get a bigger corner. It's ok.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fb];W[hd]
(;B[bd]LB[hb:A][bc:B][cf:C]C[[j\] This damages your black stone at C, it keeps sente but I feel something else might be bterr. Perhaps secure your group with A and B and then possibly use C to more effect.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[jj]C[>Was this a mistake? I pictured white playing tengen and I didn't like the possible moyo.

[j\] Premature I think, but not so easy now.];W[gp]
(;B[fp]TR[gk][gl][gm][gn][go]SQ[fl][fm][fn][fo]LB[jj:B][cl:F]
[cn:D][dp:C][jp:A][dr:E]C[>Didn't know good response, so tried to cut off. Was this a mistake?

[j\] You can extend the lines in your mind and work out whether it seems to do more harm to black or white. The connection from A to B is tenuous and the white line of stones severely weakens this moyo you tried to create. Whereas C and D are tight and can extend in either direction.

So this play hurts your own stones and does little to hurt white. See the alternate.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[gn];B[in];W[iq]C[>With this move I lose most of bottom territory, so I'm guessing cutting off white was bad...]
;B[dr];W[cq]TR[gn][go][gp][iq]LB[fp:A][mn:B]C[[j\] The situation has become desparate for your black group. Saving these stones comes at a heavy price as gaining two eyes will result in white being stronger outside and as the marked white stones get stronger your chances of any territory in B evaporate.]
;B[hr];W[jq];B[hq];W[ip];B[kp];W[io];B[jo];W[or]C[[j\] White now reduces around you weaknesses in sente. Very painful and very little that can be done about it at this stage.]
;B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[nr];B[mp];W[qi];B[pj]TR[pd][pf]LB[pb:A]
[rf:B]C[>This was another bad move, so I'm think I focused on center territory too early.

[j\] I agree, though the cause of these issues is the result of earlier plays (as noted).]
;W[pi];B[oj];W[rf];B[ck];W[cj];B[ek];W[fi];B[gk];W[fl];B[fk]
;W[lr];B[el]C[[j\] you have another weakness which white could also exploit.]

;B[lg];W[kf];B[mg]C[>Instead of this i should have played s10?

[j\] Much earlier, yes, but white slipped up on this ages ago.]
;W[ri];B[cr]C[[j\] Good];W[br];B[bm]LB[bk:A]C[[j\] This is a good idea but another approach might be better. A move that threatens two sides is better than one which threatens only one. A has meaning both up and down the left side.]
