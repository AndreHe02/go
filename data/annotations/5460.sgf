 - Comments by Ryan (Azazil online)];B[pd];W[dp];B[ed];W[qo]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[dl]TR[ed]LB[dk:C][fp:B][en:A]C[Raikar : Should i entered san-san (3-3) instead ?

Az: This is a very strange choice since you have a high stone here. You are helping W become solid on the left side, which reduces the effectiveness of your stone. Particularly with his stone at R5, I think B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' is a reasonable joseki.]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[fp];B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[dj];B[bl];W[cg]C[Az: This is a little bit too close for W I think, but either way the result is clearly good for him]
;B[ce];W[qf];B[qi]LB[pi:A]C[Az: I think the high pincer makes more sense, since you don't want to make it easy for white to use R5.]
;W[nd]LB[oe:B][pf:A]C[Raikar: I don't know the Joseki for this move...

Az: R11 isn't joseki, so it would be hard for white to play joseki here ;). 'a' seems like common sense, since white will get a large corner if you play 'b' and the wall won't be very effective]
;B[oe];W[qc]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[Az: It's hard to find a good answer to this move, but 'b' is definetly better than 'a']
;B[qd];W[pc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[od];B[pf];W[ne];B[nf];W[mf]
C[Raikar : Black gruop Q16 is now overconcentrated  T T

Az: Very, the game looks very good for white now];B[ng]C[Raikar : Black gruop Q16 is now overconcentrated  T T

Az: Very, the game looks very good for white now];W[gc]LB[hc:A]
C[Az: I think W 'a' is good enough, this seems a little overly agressive.]
;B[jd]LB[gd:B][fc:A]C[Az: This attack doesn't make sense, white has a wall nearby and once white goes into the corner black has no base. Maybe black could try to exchange 'a' for 'b' and then play here]
;W[ge];B[ef];W[eb];B[hd]C[Raikar :This peep is good or bad ?

Az: The whole fight is difficult for black, I think the peep is alright.]
;W[gd];B[ld]C[Az: This is aji-keishi, you are helping white to become stronger.]
;W[le]C[Raikar : is it better to  moveting toward the center at J14 instead of Black 41 ?

Az: Yes];B[ke];W[mg];B[mc];W[nb];B[nc];W[oc];B[mb];W[oa];B[cb]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[ic];B[md]C[Raikar : Empty Triangle

Az: Better to leave this unplayed, it doesn't help much and it will be sente for a while.]
;W[me];B[kg];W[nh]LB[pg:A]C[Az: I think 'a' is the best response for black]
;B[og]C[Raikar : Empty triangular again T T...];W[lh]LB[gg:A]
C[Az: G13 is an excellent point, starting a splitting attack]
;B[kh]LB[gg:A]C[Raikar: I think this moveis lack of imagination , i should i playyed G13 instead T T

Az: G13 still better than answering here];W[ki];B[ji];W[gg]
;B[kj];W[li];B[ii]C[Raikar : I played a lot of wrong shape is this game...]
;W[ig];B[hf];W[gf]LB[jg:A]C[Az: Best to just play 'a' and suck it up.]
;B[hg];W[jf];B[kf];W[hh];B[ie];W[id];B[je];W[ih];B[jh];W[fh]
;B[gi]LB[pq:B][hq:A]C[Az: This is not sente, play a big move like 'a' or 'b' instead]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk];W[pq];B[fj]C[Az: Again, white doesn't have to answer this move. W is alive and connected, nothing here will be sente, so black passed a second time.]
;W[fi];B[gk];W[bf];B[be];W[db];B[cc];W[kp]LB[jq:A]C[Az: I think 'a' might be better for white, though this is clearly the right idea.]
;B[hq];W[gr]C[Az: W has no good answer because L4 should have been on the 3rd line. This is a submissive move.]
;B[cp]LB[cq:A]C[Az: No, invade 3-3];W[cq];B[bq];W[cr];B[do]
C[Az: Don't play this unless you are are ready for a big ko. Black has a lot of weaknesses in his shape, so the ko is probably a bad idea.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[co];B[ei];W[eh];B[cp];W[ba]C[Az: This is a very bad ko threat, it costs white points. You should not play ko threats which loose points.]
;B[ca];W[co];B[di];W[ci];B[cp];W[ad]C[Az: Again, very bad threat. How strong did you say white was?]
;B[ae];W[co];B[dh];W[dg];B[cp];W[ph]LB[pg:B][og:A]C[Az: Now don't you wish 'a' was at 'b' instead?]
;B[qg];W[co];B[ej];W[eg];B[cp];W[qh];B[ap];W[rg]C[Az: Black gained almost nothing from the ko, and his position is a disaster now]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[rf];W[ho]C[Raikar : I think black is lost now - -''

Az: Yes, the game is over];B[ep];W[er];B[dq]C[Az: This is too small, white can ignore you and play a big move. Q2 would be a good move]
;W[dr]C[Raikar :shold i play Q2 instead ?];B[io]C[Az: This makes no sense]
;W[ip];B[hp]LB[hr:C][go:B][iq:A]C[Az: White should play 'a' here, black 'b', white 'c']
;W[go];B[jp];W[iq];B[jq];W[ir];B[ko];W[lp];B[jr]LB[in:A][jo:B]
C[Az: White should play 'a'-'b' as a forcing exchange first]
;W[hr];B[lo]C[Az: W is playing very badly, maybe too confident he will win?]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[np];B[ri];W[rh];B[qm]C[Az: Now black almost has a chance]
;W[in];B[jo];W[qk];B[rk];W[rm];B[ql];W[rn];B[pk];W[sf];B[re]
;W[mk]LB[pr:A]C[Az: Before resigning I would try to play 'a' if I were black to see what he would do.
