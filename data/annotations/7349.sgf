C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game! I've been playing for a few months, and I finally think I understand some fundamentals about the game. I still lack confidence in fighting and, of course, in strategy as well. I had white against my 10 kyu opponent in a 30min game.

dr:  Review by drgoplayer];B[cp];W[pd];B[pq];W[ep];B[dn]
(;W[dq]C[dr:  this gives b an extra good result.  see the thread]
;B[cq];W[ip]LB[kp:C][jq:B][kq:A]C[dr:  the 4th line extension is always open to an approach on the 3rd line.  ABC makes w a bit overconcentrated]
;B[qn];W[dd];B[kc]LB[jc:A][cj:B][kq:C][lq:D]C[ A strange looking move.

dr:   I would have played at A but OK
b is missing big moves at B or C.  w at B or D will make black stones inefficient]
;W[nc];B[hc];W[fc];B[dj]LB[ch:A][dh:C][ci:B]C[dr:  nice move for w at A since b played high]
;W[dl]C[dr:  I like a leaning attack for b here. see thread]

(;B[cm]SQ[dj]C[I feel like this was a small mistake. I was expecting 17 B E8.

dr:   E8 might not be good.  w can easily make territory along the side in b's area of influence
b should help the single stone before strengthening w this way]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[bk];B[bm];W[ck]
(;B[dg]C[dr:  this doesnt help the b stone so much and doesnt strongly attack either weak group above or below]
;W[ce]C[Maybe too small, but I wanted to secure the corner.]
;B[kp]C[dr:  should be at L3 or G4];W[mp]C[dr:  should be at k2 or k3]
;B[mq]C[dr:  w has no good moves locally.  the w stone has given b the opportunity to strengthen stones next to a weak group.  now w must help the weak group with something like j3 or k3 and hope the m4 stone will have some value later]

(;W[lq];B[lp]
(;W[nq];B[mr];W[lr];B[np];W[mo];B[nr];W[jq]C[I wanted to prevent B L3.]

(;B[jo]C[dr:  a bit slow];W[mm];B[pk];W[hm];B[fn];W[fl];B[ff]
C[dr:  the weakness of moves on the 4th line is that they cannot secure a base easily.  so the b stones are floating]
;W[jm];B[ph]LB[qf:A][qk:C][qm:B]C[Here I was unsure. Did I give the right side too easily?

dr:  w gets sente here so can separate the weak b groups on left side and top.  Or w could invade at B ir C]

;W[cg]C[I wanted to attack the base of the three black stones.

dr:  they dont really have a base yet.  separate first here]
;B[ch];W[df];B[eg];W[ge]C[I wanted to separate the two black groups.]
;B[fj]LB[ib:B][jd:A]C[dr:  A or C are good attacking moves]

(;W[kf]C[Now I was happy with the strength towards the centre.]

(;B[qc]C[dr:  not best attack for b];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob]
(;B[mb]C[A big mistake? Could black live in the corner with 119 B S18?

dr:  no but a big ko is possible
b can try to reduce the center with ko threats while hoping to kill the entire w corner]
