C[Review by adum. Lines prefixed by "comment"are comments made by emarzin, and I'll try to comment on these comments as well as the game, I suppose. That you made these comments is useful, I believe, as it shows how you think about the game.

My single biggest piece of advice: treat moves as gold. If you make a move that's unnecessary, it's usually worth 10-15 points. Do that five times in a game, and you're down by 60.

In the same vein, don't automatically respond to your opponent's moves. ask yourself what will happen if you tenuki.

Good luck!

(;B[co]C[Comment : I think this black opening is very inefficient

it was okay (but not great) until this move. this move is unnecessary, as white cannot push through. see var. if you extend at this point instead, you're fine. white is slightly overconcentrated.

as we see later, this move costs you. maybe 30 points, as well as strength you sorely needed for a center fight.]

(;B[pc]C[not a great move because it asks white to build a wall towards his impending moyo. i like Q14 better.]

;W[jd]C[this is all pretty standard and basically even for both sides in terms of joseki, but here white gains a perfect wall and a moyo is taking shape.]
;B[gc]C[comment : I don't think this is a good invasion
Since whet happens after (big white moyo) is predictible.

yes, you're probably right that this is not a good invasion. since white's moyo is not yet territory, an invasion is not necessary. maybe playing K4 is better, or N12, or even K10. i'd go for K4, and then try to build up strength in the center to support an invasion on top.

still, it's hard to say that this invasion is absolutely bad.]
;W[fd]C[ask yourself what you want to get out of this invasion. you probably want to settle underneath after this move of white's. also, you'd like to get out in the middle to ruin territorial prospects there.

when invading, think contact moves and light play.];B[gd];W[fc]
;B[fb]C[this move is asking to play a ko. probably premature. better is coming out into the center, G18, or K18, or K17.]
;W[eb];B[hb];W[fa]C[here's where the ko comes in, the natural result of this line of play. G19 to play the ko. but it doesn't really do anything for you, so it's not a good result.]

(;B[ic]C[too slow. how about G14 to come out? i'd probably play L17 here, actually.K17 is also good. remember, contact plays.]
;W[jc]C[this effectively shuts black down on teh top, not a good result.]

;W[jp];B[hp]C[comment : f6 was probably better

I agree in terms of safety. threatens to capture at E9 or connect. however, it's a bit passive. this is entirely playable. white is too weak to have any serious attack against the H6 group. black can easily get an eye around H11, and another on teh bottom, or can break through white to the right.]
;W[fn]C[comment : no comment]
(;B[ij]C[bad. slow. this is a last resort kind of move. it just makes white stronger. i would have played J12 to subtly try and cheat white.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[rj];B[qk]C[question : any good defense against what follows ?

hard to kill this invasion. better to use it to gain strength to attack white in the middle.]
;W[qh]C[mistake by white! he should have gone the other way. now, you can kill it. just don't fall for the cut. it's not a threat.]

(;B[ph]C[oops.];W[rl]C[now white gets into open space and can't be killed.]

;B[nl]C[comment : prepares next black move];W[io]C[you have to respond to this. if you let white cut you here, he can sacrifice his stones in the middle and have an easy, simple game. make him fight to live and win, even though killing is very hard.]

Do not bother seeing the
