C[z: Game reviewed by zenjutsu (IGS 10k*) outside GTL channels, via live request.  Requestee agreed to game's submission to GTL. Reviewers comments to be preceeded by "z:" (as above). Review requested by black.

Initial play was good, and black developed a solid lead.  However, black had a long spree of overplays in the middle-game, and white capitalized on this.

Suggestion for improvement: life-and-death problems, continue to play games to develop a "feel" for what is and is not an overplay, and continue to zealously pursue joy when playing go!]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]C[z: Enclosures are an easy way to get a solid base for your shape early in the game.  A good strategy for your kyu level.]
;W[qf]C[z: No!  White approaches too closely to black's strength.  This could allow black to use his strong corner shape as something to push white against, and take control of the momentum of the game.]
;B[lc]SQ[qi][qh][pi][pj][qj]C[z: I prefer a pincer around marked points.]
;W[gc];B[qm]C[z: Good.];W[qi];B[dj]C[z: Excellent!  Letting white play around here would give him too large a framework.]
;W[rk]C[z: Wrong timing.  Too small a play.  Black can ignore this and play elsewhere.]
;B[lq]C[z: Good, however it may be too far.  It invites the 3-3 invasion, or a O3 invasion.]
;W[nq]C[z: O3 invasion.];B[iq];W[pr];B[qq];W[no];B[or]C[z: Overplay.]
;W[oq]C[z: ...and white shows why it is an overplay.]
(;B[pq]SQ[dn][df][cf][cg][dg][dm][cm][cn]C[z: Unnecessary and too small.  Better to play R2 locally, or even better, tenuki to a square-marked point.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[os];B[fq]C[z: I think I prefer approaching the corner from the other side. However, giving sure-fire stability to your bottom group is not a bad idea.]
;W[cn];B[dr]C[z: While this cuts into white's corner, it ignores the threat white is making a the D10 stone.]
;W[cq];B[cr]C[z: Too small.  White should ignore and tenuki.]

(;W[br];B[mr]C[z: Best saved for a ko-threat, if needed.];W[nr]
;B[ms]C[z: No!  Totally unnecessary.  This move (1) does not threaten white, and (2) does not do anything for black.  Black's bottom group is already safe.  Better to secure the D10 stone.]
;W[mq]C[z: ??  This play is also unnecessary.  It neither helps white, nor gives a severe threat to black.  Time to move focus to the left of the board.]
;B[kp];W[cg]C[z: ...and white is the first to play the left.  Now black has no base, and white is making shape for a large corner.]
;B[em]C[z: Right idea, but be aware it will not actually connect to the bottom.  So use this stone as a launching stone to build strength.]
;W[fo]C[z: W easily blocks connection to bottom.];B[cm];W[bm]
;B[dl]SQ[dm][cl]C[z: This stone feels misplayed.  W can easily C8, thus undercutting B.]
;W[dn]
(;B[dm]C[z: Unnecessary.  W gave B a gift, but B did not take it.  B could have played B8, ensuring an eye, and gaining a few points of territory.  Who cares if W moves into D7, B still connects at C8.]
;W[gn];B[ci]C[z: Wrong side.  B8 first, then after W B6, B is able to play in this area and make profit.]
;W[bl];B[ck]C[z: Good.  Too bad it's necessary.];W[bk];B[fk]
C[z: I prefer B10 first.  Secure an eye.];W[gl];B[fl];W[gk]
;B[fj];W[gj]C[z: W should be threatening B from top, not side.  That would expand W's corner area.]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[dh];W[fi];B[ei];W[fg]
(;B[eh]C[z: ??  Just make the capture.  Play G11.];W[gi]C[z: This seems small.  Perhaps C17 would be better?]
;B[oo];W[on];B[pn];W[om];B[of];W[oi];B[ro]C[z: Unnecessary.  ...but always better to be safe when you are uncertain.  Just work on life-and-death problems to better read when such a play is needed.]
;W[op]C[z: Small.];B[po]C[z: Also small.];W[pk]C[z: Small again.]
;B[pg]C[z: Threatens W, but you have to expect W will still make connection, so what is the follow-up to this play.  What does B benefit? I think there are larger points (such as 3-3 invasion in upper-left corner).]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[rf];B[rd];W[ql];B[jc]
;W[lf];B[jn]C[z: Good.  B sees that W is threatening to enclose center.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[jo]
(;B[hb]C[z: No!  This will strengthen W in corner, thus ensuring that B cannot do 3-3 invasion.  Also, making a finger into center is still very important.]
;W[hc];B[lo];W[kn];B[gm];W[hm];B[ie];W[jf];B[id];W[if];B[bf]
C[z: Feels like an overplay.];W[bg];B[dg];W[cf];B[be];W[df]
C[z: I think a play at C15 is better.  This play allows B to C17, and make eye space.]
;B[cd]C[z: Nope.  C17 is the play.];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb]
;W[ce];B[bd];W[af];B[ae];W[ba]C[z: B doesn't have enough space for two eyes.]
;B[ag];W[ah];B[bh]C[z: Good!  Using a ko threat is a great way to use this situation in the corner.  Now, having ko-threats becomes key.]
;W[ai]C[z: This play just delays the ko, and removes one of W's ko-threats.]
;B[cj]C[z: ?  Wasted stone.  Should be A10 to force the ko.]
;W[bi]C[z: ?  Better to A10 for connection.  Safer.];B[ch];W[eg]
C[z: No!  Now B can A14, and ensure life.]
(;B[bj]C[z: A14 is the correct play.  See alternative move tree.  However, this play still leaves a ko.]
;W[af]
(;B[fe]C[z: I don't think this threat is big enough for the ko.  See alternative move tree for an example.]
;W[ag];B[fc];W[ge];B[gd];W[hd];B[fd];W[he];B[gb]C[z: Good.]
;W[ic];B[ia]C[z: ?  Just J18 to connect.];W[jd];B[kd];W[ke]
C[z: Good recognition of snapback.];B[jb];W[ld];B[md]C[z: I think L17 is safer.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[kd];B[eb]C[z: Good.  Threaten to make life for corner group.]
;W[ib]C[z: ??  W must reinforce D17.];B[dc]C[z: Excellent!  Very big play.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[ea]
(;B[fb]C[z: No!  This lost the corner.  F19 was the play.  ...or E14. See alternative move tree.]
;W[ab]C[z: I think B is dead now.];B[da];W[ca];B[fa];W[ac];B[da]
;W[ad];B[ea]C[z: No.  Only 1 point (prevents capture), but loses sente.  Furthermore, if W makes capture, they have to play again (at D19) to prevent you from returning capture.  So, W has to capture, AND lose sente for 1 point.  This type of play is, literally, the smallest play possible in the game other than playing neutral points.  This should be the last stone played in game.

Also, B still has lingering weakness at N17/M18.];W[lb]C[z: Ouch.]
;B[mc];W[ka];B[ja]C[z: Still in atari.];W[ha];B[mb];W[ee]C[z: Unnecessary.]
;B[jp];W[ko];B[lp]C[z: Unnecessary.  W cannot break the connection by playing at M4, so why feel forced to make the connection and lose sente?]
;W[ln];B[go];W[ho];B[gp];W[fm];B[en];W[fn];B[eo];W[ep];B[fp]
;W[jm]C[z: ?  Unnecessary.  D5 better.  Or O13.];B[ng];W[mh]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[mo];W[mn];B[qs];W[or]C[z: Unnecessary.  Can be played later.  B just gave W sente, and W chose to waste it.]
;B[mp];W[np];B[bn];W[bo];B[bp];W[co];B[bq]C[z: Good job!  Remember these minor battle victories for future tactical use.  However, also remember that small battle victories do not necessarily equate to winning the war.]
;W[cp];B[ar];W[ap];B[bs];W[ao];B[aj]SQ[mg][rm][se][ma]C[z: Small.  Better plays for B are marked.]
;W[ak];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ip];B[hq];W[lr]C[z: Nope.  The setup isn't complete.]
;B[kr]C[z: Good.];W[jr]
(;B[ls]C[z: Safer just to connect.];W[jq]
(;B[js]C[z: J2 is the safer play.];W[ir];B[hr];W[is];B[hs];W[ks]
C[z: Very dangerous ko for B.]
(;B[kq]C[z: Oops.];W[lr];B[do]C[z: Dame (neutral point).  W can make life on left with either A6 or A7.]
;W[an]SQ[ma][sd][rm]C[z: Unnecessary.  Could have used sente to play a marked play.]
;B[aq]C[z: Only 1 point (preserves B2 as a point).  Bigger plays on board.]
;W[ne]C[z: Overplay.];B[me];W[ph];B[nf];W[ma];B[na];W[la];B[ga]
C[z: ?  This group of B's is dead.  This just gave W 1 more point (prisoner) _and_ allows W to O18!]

(;W[ia]C[z: Unnecessary.  W should have O18.];B[cl]C[z: Dame.  W's side is alive.  A7 and A8 are miai, meaning white can play either to ensure life.  So this play is a 0 point gote play (gote = loses sente).]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[sm];B[sn];W[rq];B[rp];W[ps];B[rs]
;W[oh];B[oe]C[z: Unnecessary.  ...but understandable after B already lost many groups he thought were safe.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[le];B[nm]C[z: This shouldn't work.];W[nl]C[z: Unnecessary.  B's invasion didn't require a response.  It was a 1-point gift of a free prisoner.  ...however W's conservative play is understandable given his considerable lead.]
;B[il];W[im]C[z: Again unnecessary.];B[jj])
(;W[nb];B[ia];W[ob];B[pb];W[nc];B[nd];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[ja]
;W[kb];B[pc]C[z: W still alive, B's E19 group still dead, and B's corner much smaller.]
