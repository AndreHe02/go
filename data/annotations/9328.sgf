C[    Hello,
  I am Tilwen, Black in this game, and my opponent Meepy would like to have some advices too. We have played the game in the ASR, so it was a quite serious one.
 I think a big part of the game happened in the fight in the lower left corner, but then the game was close, so let us know anything that we missed later. I puy some questions in the file, thanks by advance !

Black started very good, but made a lot mistakes. White had very good position judgment and give up stones and build big moyo. Overall game was even and both side could won the game in the yose.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq];B[do]C[My opponent told me he was not sure iwhat was better between playing C5 (what I had "planned", see variation) and what he played.

[Nexik\]Both moves are normal]
(;W[oq]C[Whie is low, and I wanted to keep his two stones separated and attack. What would be interesting here ?

[Nexik\] The most intersting move in my opinion is kosumi at Q5]

(;B[eq]C[My aim is to separate, but my shape isn't nice then ...]
;W[er];B[ep];W[fr];B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[dr];B[hp]C[[Nexik\] Black position looks very good]
;W[bp]C[We saw later a reason why B3 is best here.];B[mq]C[Is this pincer ok ? What are the possibilities (and mistakes) for black and white in the fight that followed ?

[Nexik\] Good];W[po];B[pp];W[op];B[oo]C[I cut because I feel H4 would help.]
;W[no];B[on];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[ro];B[qr];W[ko];B[jp]
;W[pn];B[om];W[ql]C[I saw on eidog that white should start with Q3, but I guess the idea is the same ?

[Nexik\]I'm not sure, but maybe now black can get few more points]

(;B[or]C[[Nexik\] You should start with O3];W[pq];B[qq];W[pk]

(;B[mm];W[km];B[nk]C[I try to go out, in the same time white reinforces himself ...]

C[Here I was thinking about the possibilities of cut around P10 or R7, that's why I played the way I did. Was it bad, or too early ?

No];B[qm];W[rm]
