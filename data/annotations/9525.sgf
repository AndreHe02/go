C[I don't really have any specific questions at the moment. Just what can I do better?

Hello Marcus, I am Gabriel (12k EGF) .

I see you tried to play safe. These safe and slow moves around opponent's territory actually force the opponent to make good moves (building the territory). The slow moves create heavy/thik groups what looks strong, but the think groups may be still weak or dead without eyes. 

I liked the fighting attitude, but unfortunatelly followed by string of slow moves with weaknesses left behind. B played slow moves too. Almost all the game. But B was able to exploit the cuts/weaknesses W left, could cut and apparently could count further ahead.


Few points to take

- PLAY LIGHT. I see this over and over the whole game. One cannot comprehend all aspects of GO quickly, but the main lesson from this game should be - play lighter. Placing many stones together without purpose (connecting, creating eyes) creates a heavy overconcentrated group with no points (or life). White NEEDS TO PLAY LIGHT (sabaki) . http://senseis.xmp.net/?Sabaki  Place the stones further apart, gaining influence or territory faster and not forcing the opponent to close its territory

- don't force you opponent to play good moves. you had a correct feeling "It seems like every move I make hurts me more than helps me." It happends when you are confortable with expectations - you play a move and know what your opponent will reply. But usually it means that you force you opponent to make a good move. 

- don't attack against  a weak group.  Create solid base first. That can serve as a base to chase opponent's stones against. Having stones floating in the middle without connection to any base is difficult. White played heavy (having overconcentrated stones) resulting in multiple weak groups. Tto build a solid base on the 3dr line - use 4 space jumps 

- slow moves near opponent's moyo help the opponent to build its territory. think of the purpose of the moves, search for big moves first

- play light . again..

- to create safe 3rd line - 1-2-3+jump (2 stones are too few for a solid wall)

- have a break for strategic overview


Good luck and - I hope my review will be useful for you.];B[pd]

(;W[pn]C[The shoulder-hit is the traditional answer to the 3-3.

Playing 3-3 corner I consider low, especially in the opening, but some players play 3-3 happily. The aim I see is to get the corder almost for sure and peep outside. It is very small to get enclosed only with few points. 

I assume W wanted to play a pincer here, however the 3-3 stone is 'naked' with no friends and under direct attack. So W needs to defend. B stone is low enough so it doesn't neet to worry about its life and influence. Q6 here only forces B to separate the W stones and set up a base

The last two moves were too slow. They don't create any base, don't attack B, make no territory.  This last move actually forces B to fix  its shape, gain territory  and become strong. W becomes heavy / concentrated (too many stones together, too many  to sacrifice, creating no or few points) . 

I see this play over and over the whole game. W NEEDS TO PLAY LIGHT (sabaki) . http://senseis.xmp.net/?Sabaki  Place the stones further apart, gaining influence or territory faster and not forcing the opponent to close its territory against further attacks

 W stones on 16th line are overconcentrated. W now needs to create a base or the W stones will be floating in space with very few  points or dead if cut off.]

GV: well - W is not chasing. W now has 3 weak groups to save and a corner to develop. What would maybe save the game would be catching the marked B group.

In that case  W must attack from two sides and the W groups (neither one) are not very confortable yet.]

;B[ff];W[fe];B[ef]TR[dd][ce][cf]C[I kept making moves that seemed to strenghten my opponent more than weaken him. Instead it made my stones weaker. How can I make more solid moves?

GV: on the contrary - W needs to make lighter moves. You made too many solid moves for a price - slow progress, having multiple heavy and weak groups and not willing to sacrifite any of them. 

The Black's F14 move was exactly expecting what W did - push it against a friend (the corner stone), securing a corner and cutting off the white stone.  So a light move (as e.g. c14)  would be more useful. Or directly attacking the corner stone. 

Playing light has its price too - more openings, cutting points (you have them anyway).

From time to time you should stop focusing about the next move.. stop and have a strategic look over the board. W has a dead group in the middle, a very weak very weak group in the left,  two weak groups on the right side which could survive if connected (they have no eyes yet). Black is more or less solid everywhere (thanks to the slow moves of W) . Still W could try to fight and save the two groups on the right side.]
