Shedal: Hello, it is your reviewer Dmitrii Shevchenko, Shedal (1 dan) on KGS.

I reviewed either for white and black so you could learn from your opponent's mistakes.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me at KGS or by Email.

My comments will be marked like this one.];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc]

;B[qn];W[ql]
(;B[qq]LB[on:A][nq:B][np:C]C[Looking back on this move, I'm wondering if it was a mistake.  This
lets him build up a lot of thickness.


Shedal: It is perhaps just a matter of style.
With this move, you obtain a big corner, while your opponent gets a nice thickness. Quite reasonable exchange, provided that you will have sente and already have a moyo on the left.

Of course, there are another possibilities like A, B or C. I would probably choose A (see var.)]

Shedal: you are right. Maybe Q2 would be even better.];W[qr]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[qm];W[pm];B[oc]C[I don't know why I'm inviting for my group to get killed.  S8 looks
better.

Shedal: right.];W[rm];B[rn];W[rk];B[dr]LB[rs:A]C[Now... Why I don't just play S4 to let my group live is beyond me.
 I think at the time, I wanted to experiment with sacrificing it to
see how many tenukis I could get... but had to be better to just
save it.

Shedal: A is the move here];W[rs];B[rp]

;B[hc];W[sp];B[he]C[Well.. things aren't too bad.  I got a couple of moves top to
secure territory, as well as the bottom left.  Also H15 splits white
in two, and some fighting here will benefit me I think.

Only problem is the huge white thickness in bottom right...
dominates the whole board.


Shedal: due to white's mistake of T2, you've got an extra move, the game is favorable for black.]

;W[bb];B[ad];W[ab];B[jf]C[Looking back, this move looks bad.  M16 looks better.


Shedal: this move cannot be bad as it is the vital point for white to escape.
This way you are likely to build a huge moyo, and even kill the white group in the process.]
;W[md];B[lc]LB[mf:A]C[I do this to remove white's base here so I can attack him some
more.


Shedal: white does not have a base, because you can slide under from both sides.
You should blockade white with A.];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jj]LB[go:A]
[hp:B][jn:C][mf:D]C[Trying to play on a large scale.  I wanted to use this move to
both attack white and as an anchor to reduce the white bottom.
Also, this move works well with the left side too.  I think this is a
good move.


Shedal: I can't say if this move good or bad... but at least, your thinking has wrong priorities.
First of all, you should attack white, and secondly, you must build your own moyo on the left in the process. And only last thing to do may be reducing white's bottom. Actually, white needs another 2 moves to make solid territory from his moyo.

So, even if you needed to build a moyo and reduce right now, you could A, B or C.
But to attack white, D is a must.];W[jc];B[mc];W[fd];B[fe];W[fo]
LB[hb:A]C[Shedal: good move from W, securing some territory and reducing your moyo.
But first of all, W should safe his stones on the top with A. To die peacefully for him is out of the question.]
;B[hq]TR[jc][jd][kd][ld][md]LB[gd:A]C[F7 looks much better.  I don't know why I decided to invade here.
 Perhaps I was panicing about the large white bottom.

Shedal: F7 is better to enclose your moyo. But A is much better as it revives your attack on the marked W group.]

;W[gj];B[gi];W[hi];B[gh];W[hh];B[jh];W[ij]TR[jj]C[Shedal: ok, now your marked stone is useless for your moyo. Still, you have a chance to use it to kill W's upper group.]
;B[jl]LB[gd:A]C[I didn't notice he could cut here.  L10 is an alternative I found,
but looks slow.  H13 looks good too.


Shedal: Still, A is the move that would attack white and help reducing white's bottom.]

Hylomorph [8k\]: thx


Shedal: You could win this game easily if you attacked the marked white stones when it was possible. Such attack would help either strengthening your left-side moyo and reducing white's bottom.

I think you should read some book about attack and defence.]
