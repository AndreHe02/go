C[Hi!

This was a game on KGS a few days ago, me as white.

KKMD: Hi, I will be your reviewer during this trip through your game. Please fasten your seat belt and extinguish your cigarette.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[cc];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]
(;W[op]LB[cq:A][iq:B]TR[fq][dr]C[I don' think there's anything wrong with this....

H3 perhaps?  and what about C3; that seems small, doesn't it?

KKMD: I wouldn't tenuki at this point, though I guess it must be playable. C3 may be small indeed (but not so), the point is that it is urgent, since at this point plays at A and around B are miai for the settlement of the marked group. In fuseki, play urgent moves before big moves. That's why H3 is also an option here ; however, black may not want to answer submissively at C3, and could complicate things (see variation for one example).]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[qn];W[jq]LB[hq:B][iq:A]TR[fq][dr]
C[KKMD: I would rather play A or even B instead, to put some pressure on the marked group.]
;B[iq]C[KKMD: Weird, since the simple C3 was still available for black.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[nc];W[qj]C[I really haven't taken the time to learn any joseki, but these two corners were both basic joseki, right?

KKMD: I'm not a joseki wizard myself ;-) but this is indeed a common joseki. Please note that by now and with the possible exception of J4/K4, the whole right site of the board has become uninteresting. The reason is that all formations there are low and rock-solid.]
;B[cq];W[kc]C[I'm not entirely sure what I had in mind at this point.  It seems reasonable enough though.

KKMD: Proverb : don't play near thickness. Black position around O17 certainly is "thickness", so L17 must be a bad move. I feel this move has no meaning, and you say yourself you didn't have a clear idea about that. My personal behaviour is : if you can't even find a purpose to one certain move, don't play it.]
;B[gc];W[id];B[ge];W[df];B[ib];W[md]TR[ib][gc][kc][id][ge]C[I also considered C11, another extension down the side, but I liked the thought of connecting this group and creating a moyo around the center/right area.  I suppose he could have played O16 here and ruined that, but then I would still have been able to extend down the side.

KKMD: At this point your first preoccupation should be the marked groups, which are not settled yet. To think about moyos in this situation seems utopic. Indeed O16 seems threatening, but more toward these three stones than toward this so-called "moyo".]
;B[cg];W[cf];B[dg]LB[eg:A]TR[ib][gc][ge]SQ[cg]C[KKMD: Proverb: "hane at the head of two stones". The first move I would consider in this situation is A. In this situation it seems particularly interesting, to prevent a connection between the marked groups. Remember that the triangled stones are still not fully settled.]
;W[ck]TR[cg][dg]C[I suppose O16 is still an option for black at this point, but it would be awfully agressive ignoring the two black stones at C13

KKMD: I agree, but I would say that anyway, the marked stones are quite misplaced.]
;B[fg];W[nd];B[oc];W[jh]C[Mapping out part of the center];B[mh]
;W[ql]C[Going against my initial plan and taking only a few points along the bottom.  This seems to be very small.  I'm not sure what the best play is here.  Suggestions?  N9 N10, perhaps?

KKMD: This is indeed very small. If you want to find a meaning to this move, it should be to strengthen the R10 stone, not to make territory ; since R10 isn't weak, it seems useless. If you consider this region as a moyo, a consistent play could be N10.]
;B[mj];W[bi]C[again, a few more points along the side, there are larger plays, right?

KKMD: Much larger :-)];B[ci];W[bj];B[ej];W[ei]C[I started reading a few more articles about shape lately, and I thought this might be an interesting play.  There wasn't much reason for it, I was just curious about how it would work out.

KKMD: You're absolutely right to test crazy things : try and learn. This move reminds me of the "incomprehensible tesuji" :o)]
;B[fi];W[ed]LB[eb:A]C[This is grabbing more points around the side again, but it seems to be bigger than my other moves like R8

KKMD: Bigger, maybe, but still too small. Locally I prefer A, which puts a little more pressure on the black group.]
;B[di];W[ok]TR[mh][mj]C[KKMD: The idea of this move must be to prevent a connection between the marked group and the bottom right group, I presume. But it looks like wrong direction : you are pushing the marked weak group from your strong side, and I can't see how black could connect with one move. So, K10, for instance, would be more consistent.]
;B[ki];W[kh]C[Extending down would put more pressure on the black group I suppose, but this way I start making territory towards the top.

KKMD: You cannot expect more than 10 points in this area, so I think J11 is better.]
;B[lh];W[kj]C[Trying to put pressure on the black group again.  Basically another crazy move based on what I was reading about shape]
;B[ji]C[Black simply extends and is in no danger.];W[kf];B[ii]
C[Trying to avoid an attack on the two white stones which would reduce my potential territory at the top.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[ip];B[hq];W[jp]C[These moves would be good, I think, if done at the right time.  How do I know when the best time is though?

KKMD: Big question... You may touch the very essence of go :-)


Clearly doing it before black was a help.

KKMD: I would have done it long ago, since this statu quo was threatening for the white group.


I was hoping now to start making territory around the L7 area.

KKMD: Please note that this would have been easier to do, had you played N10 instead of R8.]
;B[ml]C[black extends and ruins that idea];W[km];B[kk]C[This concerned me as there wasn't any room for the white stone to escape. Would playing at K8 now be better than playing it as a forcing move after K10

KKMD: I think K10 is a great idea.];W[jj];B[ik];W[jl];B[jk]
;W[il];B[fo];W[oh]C[again, another move just grabbing more territory. Are these okay, or should I be trying to stick with what I'm doing a little more?

KKMD: I would say we are already in yose, so (in fact by definition of  "yose", so I realize I'm not very helpful) it's OK to think that way.]
;B[lb];W[kb]C[This is too small, isn't it?  Or would extending to M17 be okay?

KKMD: There is no territory for you here, you're just destroying at most 5 points of prospective black territory. This is small indeed, and M17 too.]
;B[mb];W[lg]C[I should have played this earlier too!

KKMD: This may be not as valuable as you think. You're  using many stones to protect only 10 points !]
;B[mg];W[mf];B[og];W[pg];B[ng];W[if];B[ih];W[ig];B[hg];W[mn]
;B[om];W[eb];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[gl];B[gd];W[in]C[Is H9 better, or where would be best at this point? black at J6 won't get very far anyway, I don't think.

KKMD: J6 is very small, almost useless, unless I missed some tactical point ? Locally H9 is certainly better but there must be bigger points, like S7 for instance.]
;B[fm];W[em];B[fl];W[el];B[ek]C[trying to add some territory to the left group]
;W[dk];B[hl];W[hm];B[hk];W[gm];B[gn]C[I was considering F9 then F10, tor reduce black's territory, but decided to reduce at the top instead.

KKMD: There is almost nothing at the top. I widely prefer your first idea (note that black can provoke funny stuff by answering G9 after F10, but I think this should be even funnier for white).]

;W[cd]C[KKMD: Did you consider A15 instead ?];B[ae];W[bg];B[af]
C[was concerned about B12 and a ko fight.];W[bh];B[ch];W[re]
;B[rd];W[se]TR[qd][rd][qe][re][qf]C[KKMD: This is a common situation. Look at the marked local situation. Now a play by black is sente, whereas a play by white is gote. If you had played S14, then this would be a gote-gote situation, which is preferrable for you. So T15 is locally a bad move.]

KKMD: You played very well, I had really a hard time pointing out clear mistakes.

I am concerned about the grabbing territory and ignoring what I'm trying to do in certain areas, or is that alright?

KKMD: This is really a difficult matter... In the big scheme, you shouldn't play in the fuseki a move whose only concern is to grab territory, and grabbing territory becomes more and more important as the games flows. But this is essentially a matter of style.


Thanks for any and all advice!])
