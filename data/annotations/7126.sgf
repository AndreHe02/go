C[I'm black. I started very well, but in the middle white gained a lot...


Hi, my name is Daniel, my strength is 1-2 kyu kgs.

Well, to my opinion you lost the game in yose. Though mistakes were from both sides, opponents yose was much better. 

If you want to get stronger try to improve your yose. Dont make automatic moves, stop for a second and count. Try to find big moves in yose and keep sente.
I recommend you to read the book The Endgame by Tomoko Ogawa and James Davis, it's available in the internet.

Advice from a strong dan player:
If you are ahead in the game, don’t search for a fight but try to consolidate all your positions making the game easy. Try the simplest move first, and if it works, don’t look for a move that gains you one more point (but leaving a weakness in your shape).

(;B[gc]LB[cc:B][ic:A]C[Dubious move to my mind, you give opponent chance to make extension from wall which he didnt make earlier. Thus his wall becomes effective.

That's a good move. Maybe I would prefer to play from weaker group, also making pressure on w.]

Well, in fact C17 gives you only ko, note the place of G17 stone. But G7 does really nothing, maybe strengthening w. So instead you should think of  A, B or C.]
;W[ql]C[Good move, remember I told you about ladder breaker. The opponent punishes you for being too aggressive.]
;B[nm];W[ec];B[fj]LB[ei:A][bj:B][km:C]C[now i try to destroys white territory...

E11 is the shape move here.
You should have counted points, w is about 50 (a bit less), you are almost 60. So it's good time to start big yose moves (macro yose) if all your groups are safe. But you have one weak group so C is urgent now. Note that weak group in yose is -15 points.]

This is definately not shape move. Before running try to find some forcing moves to make shape.]
