;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over my game. I was playing black and lost to white's style of making a lot of weak groups for both players. I'm not used to this style, since it's different from just straight up trying to kill everything everywhere and also different from trying to live everywhere in your territory. In the end I probably tried too hard to kill white and ended up dead myself. In any case I hope you can tell me how to avoid such situations. If there are moves in this game that would have made the game peacefull, I would have wanted to play them.

The main points I want to ask about, as well as my thoughts on most of the moves will be included as comments. Please try to validate or correct those thoughts, since that is the way I would improve, while avoiding long complicated variations, except in the opening. Also please try to point out typical shapes and the plans, ideas or expectations attached to each suggested move. I'm very much looking forward to learn from your experience.


--- Hello I will be your reviewer.

In this game, you have some good plays and have some good ideas.

However, there some crucial points in the game that you can improve upon.

First, you left weak groups behind without enough support. For example, in the first lower left corner sequence, you left 2 weak groups in the corner and at the bottom. 

You also need to understand that the white group that captures your two stone in the lower left is a very strong group. It cannot be attacked easily and your weak group should not be left behind.

Next, in the white invasion on the lower right, you should connect and the white stone can be captured easily. Letting white separated you into two groups create a lot more issues that spread out over the borad.

Lastly, the middle black group that was running away was a bit too slow. You need to look for opportunity to move quickly, e.g. with one space jump, not just extending solidly and let the opponent dictates you.]
;W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep];W[gq]C[I'm still quite uncomfortable with pincers against the high approach. White played a trick-joseki in this game and got a good result with it twice. I wonder what I should have done differently.]
;B[cq];W[dp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bp];W[eo];B[fp];W[fq];B[cn]C[I really don't know how to get a good result here. My corner is actually not alive. (It ended up dying towards the end of the game)
Should I try to run out F4?

--- This move (C6) is a weak move. It requires follow-up move to fix the weakness around B5. Otherwise, white plays there and can cut off your C6 stone. 

It should be better if you solidly extend at B5 instead.];W[do]
C[I decide that it's too risky to run out F4 here and play a move that threatens to do it.]
;B[jq]LB[bo:A]C[--- You need to fix the weakness at A. If white plays there, your corner group will be cut off from the outside. 

White may not play there immediately, but this could leave black in bad shape.

You can play something like B2 to prevent white A and also prepare for a living in the corner.]
;W[go]C[white captures. I take both peeps right away, which I maybe should keep as ko threats.

--- The peeps look OK. It may not be a ko threat later if white gets stronger.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[fn];W[fo];B[de]LB[mq:B][br:A]TR[hp][jq]C[And here we go again. I think the result on the bottom left is good for me, but probably white had some good choices there. In particular white can try to kill my corner with b5 at any time. This time white played differently.


--- Since white can play B5 to cut off your corner, the result on the lower left is not good for you.

Also, the marked stones in the lower area are too close to a VERY strong white group. Some moves around N3 will stabilize this group. 

You should play A now. Then, once you have sente, a move around B will be good.]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd]C[here white decided not to cut, which should be even worse.]
;W[cj]TR[dc][dd]C[--- Bad move by white to abadon the marked white group. This white group was hit by "hane at the head of two stones".]
;B[db]C[--- Good follow up];W[fd];B[fc];W[ee]
(;B[df]C[--- Throw-in at E16 and squeeze by black would be better. See variation.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[cf];B[ce];W[dh]C[This time my corner seems pretty solid and white's group doesn't have two eyes yet (basically both of them even). I decide against an all-out attack.]
;B[eg];W[gf];B[eb]C[ white should probably ignore this. It's aimed at connecting to f17, not at killing two stones.

--- I agree. Now two white stones has no impact on strong black group. White should play around H16 to secure this group.]
;W[ed];B[gd]
(;W[ge]C[wonder if white could have cut

--- White cut at G16 would create two weak groups. Both to be attacked strongly by black.]
;B[hd];W[nc]C[I decide to pincer and build the top.


--- The pincer is OK.];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]
(;B[og]LB[if:A]C[I even play this because that wall seems very uncomfortable to me. Every second time I play this joseki (and I don't do it often) this wall of mine ends up under attack let alone making territory.

--- This joseki ends at white R14. Black can play J14 next, instead of P13. It will press upper-left white group to run and build the upper black side. See variation.

Since black plays P13, white should play J14. It stabilize white group and reduce black's top.]
;W[pf]C[this is a strange response.];B[of];W[nq]LB[lq:A]TR[hp]
[jq]C[Is there a severe followup against the top right corner? On the bottom right I can't decide what to do. In the end I choose something that's maybe too agressive, however my thought is that white has 3 weak groups right now and I should be able to get out with my two stones on the bottom somehow.


--- Top right corner of white group is already quite secure. You can later aim at R12 to seal of the right side from white.

As I stated earlier, black two stones cling to a VERY strong white group. Probably black at M3 to build a base and attack the white stone might be better.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[kp]C[and now I have to prove it.

--- White group on the left is strong.

The better thing for black might be trying to jump to the center. See variation.]

(;B[kq];W[jp];B[lp];W[lo];B[mq]C[bad move by me. Not sure what to do though. It's a difficult fight. I don't think I can live locally.]
;W[mr];B[ip];W[mp];B[lq]
(;W[lr]TR[mo]C[strange move by white. I think he could cut.

--- Yes, white can cut.

But he needs to be careful of cutting point at N5. It is very difficult to tell who will win without actually playing out on the board. See variation.]
;B[or]C[trying to secure my corner.];W[nr];B[qe]C[I decide to play a few moves against this corner first to think carefully what to do on the bottom.]
;W[re];B[rg]C[bad move. White should ignore this move and play on the bottom.


--- White should not ignore this. He needs to keep Q14 group for breaking into the black's left side area.]
;W[rf];B[jn]C[trying to get out. I guess white already got a good result on the bottom, since he could capture my five stones anytime. However, I guess he didn't see that.


--- If white cuts at J3 now, black has a huge lose.

So, it shows that fighting at the bottom is not a good decision to start with. Black should run out at move 65. 

Or, better yet, pincer at M3 on move 60 to avoid the whole complication.]
;W[kn];B[jo];W[ko];B[hn];W[kr]C[Again.

--- You are correct. White should cut now at J3 instead of this move.

His group would be very strong after capturing 5 stones.];B[iq]
C[Now I just connect. Running out seems quite possible now.

--- Yes, that was a bad move by white.];W[mn]C[white defends his cut.]
;B[gn]C[Now I'm thinking whether it's possible to kill either of white's groups. I probably tried too hard to do it and lost the game.

--- White can play B5. So, the bottom-left white group is not in danger yet. Both white groups are not in OK now.

Playing G6 strengthen your group. So, it is also a good move.]
;W[jm];B[ho]C[maintaining connection threatening to make an eye in sente]
;W[qo]C[This is a very annoying move. I came to the conclusion that playing Q5 would let white live in the corner and force me to run.

--- The only move is to connect at Q5. Nothing good will come out if you let your group to be cut into two weak groups.

White cannot live in the corner that easily since you have a strong wall.]

(;B[qp];W[po];B[rp]C[aiming at life in the corner while threatening P5.]
;W[ro]C[White challenges me to play p5 and I oblige.];B[oo]
;W[op];B[om]C[trying to kill white. I wonner what should happen here? Can white kill my corner?]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[rn];B[rl];W[pm];B[on];W[rm]C[Now my cutting stones are in trouble.]
;B[ol];W[ql]C[Here I decide that it's too dangerous to try to kill white right now and I need to play a move in the corner to live. I'm not sure about the life and death status of the shape in the corner.

--- I think black could be in huge trouble if white plays at R2. So, it is good to play there first.]
;B[qr];W[pj]C[white is not content with life but attacks my cutting stones. If all groups on the board just lived, black would be far ahead on points. My estimate is about 20 points. However I didn't manage to save my cutting stones.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[oj];W[pi]C[Here I played a terrible mistake. I was too greedy and didn't want white to have the whole right side. However I can't allow white to push out into the middle sealing off my cutting stones. This might be the game deciding mistake.

--- Yes, black should continue at P11.]
(;B[ph];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni]C[--- Now black is in trouble.];B[no]
;W[mo];B[lm]C[threatening to kill white while trying to make eye shape]
;W[km];B[mj]C[--- This move is a bit slow. With support of black group, you can play M10 instead.]
;W[mi];B[lj]C[--- Again, L10 is faster for black.];W[jj]C[white wants me dead.]
;B[li];W[mg]C[And this is one more game where my wall in that joseki comes under attack.]
;B[lh];W[ng];B[lg]C[I'm focused on running out.

--- It is very difficult game for black now. Everywhere he runs to, white might make nearby black groups weaker.

Still playing K12 is better since it is faster than the actual move.]
;W[nb]C[I should probably play O16 here rather than try to connect under.

--- Yes, since the wall is weak now. O16 is correct.]
(;B[na];W[ne]C[here I should probably give up the P14 group but I'm greedy and try to save everything.]
;B[oe];W[le]C[Now it seems like I have to connect under and hope my middle group can live somehow.]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[je]C[I decide that playing K17 is too passive, although my stones seem in big trouble there. I try to lean against whites weak group in the top left, however white just lets that one go.]
;B[if];W[jf];B[jg];W[ie];B[he];W[ig];B[hf];W[jh]C[here I become worried, white could play something like K17 and kill my wall on the right. I'm not sure if that's actually the case. Connecting L13 seems quite quite pointless though.  I need to somehow live with all my groups to win. It seems difficult.]

(;B[jc];W[kg]C[Now the game depends on whether I can live in the middle. I try to scare white into thinking his bottom group might die while making eye shape.]
;B[jk];W[kk]C[Maybe I should have played L9 instead of K9.

--- Even with black L9, still very difficult to live.

You need to cut at L10 to have a chance. See variation.]
(;B[lk];W[kl];B[mm]C[It's not possible to live and the game is lost.]
;W[pl];B[nn];W[ll];B[ml];W[nk];B[ik];W[kj]C[Now white just plays safe and keeps his huge advantage. I launch a few more attempts but he doesn't make a mistake.]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[mf];W[nf];B[me];W[lf];B[md];W[nd];B[ld];W[jd]
C[not sure what that's supposed to be. seems like white is worrying about the wrong group. In any case I should not respond here.]

(;B[bq]C[white even decides that it's me who dies here.
