[gq]C[Slack move, I'm sure.  Also  considered R10, C7.
---
R10 is big. I think G3 is better than C7, but I like F3 even better. F3 looks  smaller, but it leaves less aji in the corner.
Another approach would be to first exchange Q3 for P4, and then attack with  the checking extension at K3, and then draw back to G3.]
;W[qr];B[rq]C[This is  small. I think sente is worth more than this move.]
;W[rr]C[Also a small move,  White is strong here so this is unnessesary.]
;B[qj]C[Good];W[qc];B[pc]C[Block  on the other side?  Seems too easy on white to let him have Q17.
---
This is the right side to block. White will live no matter what you do.]

[sd];B[qf];W[nb];B[pa];W[qa];B[oa];W[sb]C[This looks good for black. o19 is a  large endgame move, as it cannot be blocked at N19.]
;B[cn]C[Okay, he lives in  gote.  Now what?  Another slack move?  Also considered C4 and K3.
---
Yes I like both C4 and K3 better than this move. The corner is not completely  secure yet, since white can still get ko by invading at the 3-3 point.]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[Did this without thinking.  Probably a mistake, but white also makes  mistakes in the sequence to follow, and the result is not too bad.
---
Black is alive on both sides, and it looks very difficult to kill the white  stone so I would ignore it for the time being and play elsewhere. K4 is a  good point, and invading White's moyo on the top is another possibility.

Reading out possible sequences after the cross-cut makes me liking this move  more and more. Every resulting ladder seems to be in Black's favour.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dm]C[The proverb says: 'extend from the cross-cut', but all ladders  that results from extending are good for black so extending does not work  here.]

(;B[lj]M[gq]C[Okay, N8 doesn't seem to be sente  against my moyo.  Now what?  White is
getting two huge moyos, and I am beginning to look pretty sad.  Could I
have done something more useful at the bottom, with the marked stone?
---
The marked stone is not dead yet. See variations.
Black is still ahead. White top is about the same size as Black right, and  Black left is more than White lower right.]
