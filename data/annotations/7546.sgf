C[[krinid\] I've only included up to move 101 as beyond this move, the game is already decided.  At that point, I'm already in a bad position where I've been forced to live small in a few areas and my center group is in jeopardy.

I was thrown off from the beginning with an odd fuseki that abandoned a corner in exchange for side influence and never recuperated.

How could I have played better in the fuseki and midgame?


erker: Hello, krinid.
I will do the review. I hope you enjoy it.

As a general remark: You should pay more attention to the strength/weakness of groups. Weak groups carry destructive power, they are time bombs. So do try to create weak groups of your opponent's color and avoid to create weak group of your own color. 
One could say that the game went south after Move 16, not 101, because you allowed White to exploit your weak lower left corner.
Ways to avoid weak groups: Build strength before you attack, premature attacks lead to more weak groups (bottom/lower left corner, upper left corner). Abandon weak groups early, before it's to expensive (bottom/center group).]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[jq]C[[krinid\] I wasn't sure how to respond to this.  I tenuki'd and took the remaining corner.


erker: See my comment on Move 6.];B[pd];W[qj]LB[jp:B][jq:A]
TR[dp][pp]C[erker: You said "I was thrown off from the beginning with an odd fuseki that abandoned a corner in exchange for side influence and never recuperated."

With the two marked black stones, it is natural (for Black) to play at A or B to control the whole side. One way to prevent this is with White at A.
There is no reason to panic. White just played two reasonable moves a bit to early, that's all. As a result, Black stands better.]
;B[mq]LB[fc:C][jd:D][qm:A][pp:B]C[erker: I don't like this move.

The white stone is more or less immune to attack, because if you push from the right, White goes to the left, if you push from the left, it goes to the right. (This is a very important concept: miai. Have a look at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Miai)

Even if you're allowed to play at n3 and A, you gain nothing: The formation A-B-n3 is bad, as White will invade the corner.
For reasons of miai, B is also more or less immune to attack.

To summarize: You don't have a good attack, you don't need to defend, and you can not build something of big value as the white stones restrict the lower right corner.

But the top and the right side are open, so you can gain more, if you play at C (and continue with D) for example.]
;W[fq];B[hq]LB[dn:A]C[erker: I think this is a bit greedy. You don't have to deny everything to White to win. You only need to get the better end of a deal.

If you just defend the lower left corner (with A), you can attack at h3 later, but from a stronger position. And if White defends to prevent the attack, you further extend your corner or play elsewhere.]
;W[fo];B[ho]LB[cn:D][dn:C][fo:B][hq:A][dr:E]TR[fq][jq]C[[krinid\] Perhaps black D2 would have been better than H5.


erker: No and no.

The purpose of A is to separate the two marked white stones. If you want to keep White separated, you must jump into the center. If you don't want the separation, why did you played at A in the first place? If you feel the urge to answer B with defending the corner, that means the exchange A-B is questionable. 

But image you played at C instead of A and White played elsewhere. Later, you exchange A for B. That would be a strong attack and jumping into the center with h5 just feels natural.


Looking only at the corner, Black at E is an absolute no-no. White will play at C  or D and that is to good to allow. Why? Because you allow White to shut you in. Your corner group will make at most 10 points, but it will no longer be an active part of the game. Instead, White gets strong and will dominate the left side.

So, defending a 4-4 stone is best done with C or D. Later, E is a good point to secure the corner, but not so early in the game. 

As a general rule: don't let your groups be shut in.];W[dn]

;B[qo];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[mp];W[jn];B[gn]TR[ho][hq][iq]C[erker: Very bad!

A moment ago you had three worthless stones as they separate two more or less stable groups. You should abandon such worthless stones without hesitation.
The next moment you are going to add stones to the worthless ones. As a result White gets strong at the left AND the right. Your running group is still worthless, but after a few moves it is so big that you can not afford to abandon it anymore.
There is no way to win a game with such a burden.

It's better to build a position at the top (getting points, building influence), then invade the left. Maybe you can rescue your three stones later without helping White.]

[gm][gn][ho][hq][iq]C[erker: Again, this looks a bit greedy.

The problem is that this move gives White an excellent excuse to play at A (as in the game). As a result White builds strength at the left side. But because of the weak, eyeless center group, that is something you should avoid. (Because of the center group you have a handicap and can not play as free as you want. White has the advantage.)

So I think it is better to first stabilize the top. This gives you points you need and something your center group can run to later.

As a rule: don't create new weak groups if you already have some weak groups in the area. (In the game, both black groups in the upper left corner almost died!)]

LB[bd:A]C[erker: Bad! You are pushing White in the direction of your weak center group. You're helping White!
Instead of e12, play at A.];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj];B[im];W[jm];B[el]

(;B[bf]LB[bc:A]C[erker: If you play at A, both of your groups are connected (see variation).]

(;B[dm]LB[cm:A]C[[krinid\] Black F7 is probably better to at least solidify 1 eye at this point.


erker: Even if White had sheepishly answered with A, this is a bad move. This costs you one liberty in exchange for one point of territory. Keep such moves until the endgame and until you're sure that you no longer need that liberty.

Making a first eye is clearly better, but you're still in trouble. (See variation.)

Thanks for the review.])
(;B[fm];W[hl];B[gl];W[jr]LB[hr:B][ks:A]TR[dc][ec][fc]C[erker: This creates an eye for White at A and prevents the second eye for Black (around B).

What will happen next? Fun for White!

Black must jump into the center. As White is strong on both sides of the black center group, White can push it around. It can be expected that White will gain some points in the center or at the top while Black is busy keeping it's group alive. Maybe the marked black stones will die as collateral damage.]
