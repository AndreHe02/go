C[Comments by Neil Mitchison, 1 kyu. Marked "NM"];B[pd];W[cp]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[eq];B[jd];W[ci];B[jp]C[I am not a fuseki expert (actually, I would say it is my weakness) but I thought I was doing well at this point.  I think it's good for the Chinese fuseki to be able to get both K16 and K4.

NM: I agree. This is good for black

However, were these moves appropriate?  Should I instead have tried defending at say, Q5 or R17 instead of taking one or both of these star points?

NM: You have to choose a style which you like, and which suits you. But in my view those moves are definitely less good. I would have played as you did.]
;W[po];B[np]C[NM: Good];W[no]C[I'm not sure of the correct response to this.  I think W normally make a base of some kind first.]
;B[mp]C[I debated the hane at N5 instead, but decided not to risk starting a crosscut fight yet, in case it put R9 or K4 at risk.

NM: This is all right. I would prefer the hane - I don't think there is danger in it - but the difference is small. Remember also you can play P4 first and then hane: it leaves white stronger, but really removes any danger.]
;W[qc]C[I was surprised by this.  It seems too early for a 3-3 invasion here.

NM: I agree. But it's clearly playable. The only real danger is if you ignore it, for example to play P5 - but it's difficult to be sure you'd come out of that fight with sente, and not answering R17 means he can get a much larger corner.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc]C[NM: Good. If you double hane, he could reply at S16 and force his way into your side.]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ok];B[oj]C[I figured I'd try to keep some territory from my wall, plus putting pressure on the W group on the right.  Would attacking from underneath somewhere have been better (maybe P8 instead of this)?

NM: I don't like this: the simple answer Q9, B Q10, W R8 leaves W very secure and the B territory much reduced. Remember there are points on the side to be had too - and, as you say, you can attack while making territory. I would play Q7, and if W replies P7 or somewhere like that, I would play Q8 then R5.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[NM: not good. If you're going to play in the corner it must be to attack, so you should play S2. But I would play Q7.]
;W[hq]
(;B[pm]C[I think this move was my first big mistake, due to his P7 on the next move.  I just induced him to make the move he wanted to make.
  
NM; I think I would have made this move. But as you can see from my analysis, P7 seems to work out quite well for B.

The question is, what would be better?

I reviewed this game after with a friend, and we looked at P7 and O9.   P7 is a more direct cut, while O9 attacks plus making the top moyo bigger.  I'm sure there are other possibilities, too.  What would have been the best move here?]
;W[om];B[pk];W[pn];B[qm];W[mo];B[lo];W[ol]C[Now his group is strong.

NM; Yes, but you've got a lot of territory. I think this is a reasonable result, and B is still ahead.]
;B[nj]C[NM: Very big, and nearly sente.];W[ll]C[NM: So it was sente!]
;B[ei]C[I thought further attacks on the right W group would be useless, so I instead turned to the left side.  I tried to start pressing down here.

NM: Yes, I like this move. The only drawback is that his BL is so strong that D9 would virtually turn the lower half of the L into territory.]
;W[li]C[NM: Interesting!]
(;B[dk]C[W played tenuki.  I didn't think passively defending my moyo was a good idea since it would let him build a wall cutting off E11.

NM: No, you certainly shouldn't defend, say at N12. But what about trying to cut? Look at variation for one idea.

However, I think this was another big mistake.  I believe a move attacking the top would have been better, rather than the bottom.  

NM: Either is possible, in my view. This is a bigger reduction, because W playing here would make territory; but D17 can be attacked, whereas C4 cannot.

There seem to be many options: D16, C12, D13 all look viable.  What is the best choice?

NM: My choice would be D15. D13 is playable. I don't like C12 (that aims at living locally), nor D16 (W C16 is very strong).

Also, a side question.  Even if C12 isn't optimal, what are the sequences that can come of it?

NM There are several - see the book "reducing large frameworks". I illustrate a couple.]
;W[cf];B[cn]C[NM: This is not good - it is no attack at all on C4 and doesn't really help D9 very much - but I have difficulty knowing what to play. I think I would either play F17 or cut off the M11 stone as I suggested earlier. Other possibilities include E2, F3, C14... Or, if you decide to give up the possibility of cutting off M11, M6.]
;W[ln];B[jr]C[This was probably another mistake.  The group can live already, and there are bigger problems elsewhere.  I think playing up top somewhere would have been better.  Maybe pressing down at D12/D13?  Or perhaps invading one of the two corner enclosures?

NM: I agree, any of those, or F17, would be better - although this makes F3 more interesting.]
;W[gc]C[NM: Huge];B[mh]C[I think this is the same kind of mistake as the one at K2.  All it does is induce him to build a wall, threatening my three stones on the left.

NM: A different mistake, but yes - you should cut.];W[lh];B[mg]
;W[dj]
(;B[ck]C[I did this since he can cut through anyway even if I can connect, so better to have one weak group than two.

 NM: I disagre. See variation. The problem is that this way your D9 group is very short of eye space, and E11 has to be abandoned.]
;W[ej];B[en]C[NM: Something like this is necessary (I think I would play F7) but humiliating.]
;W[ho];B[bj]C[I don't know the life & death of this shape well enough, and I was nervous about it surviving, so I tried to get more eye space.]
;W[fi]C[NM: Bad. W should defend at B11];B[bo];W[ko];B[lp]C[NM: Why? B12 or B3 - or with luck, both - are surely bigger.]
;W[jo];B[gm];W[fl];B[fm];W[ip];B[kp];W[kf];B[le]C[NM: Not good. There is no threat of a cut, and this turns the TL into a W moyo. You could play somewhere like J14 to reduce that. Or better yet, invade the TR corner and see what comes out of that before deciding here.]
;W[ie]C[The game is pretty much over at this point.  The top-left corner seems too big.

NM: W is ahead indeed];B[cc]C[I don't know the correct sequences to invade this enclosure (if it's even possible).  Please let me know if there is a sure way to invade or reduce in this situation.

NM: This is a classic way to invade. "sure" is a bit strong, but I'll show you some sequences. But it's all made much harder by the M15/J15 exchange, because it's harder to pull out and link, and living locally is too small.]
;W[cd];B[dd]C[NM: good. The hanes are also posible.];W[cb];B[bc]
;W[de]C[NM: Now at this point D18 lives in the corner, but after J15 the W moyo is huge. See variation for one example.]
(;B[ed]C[NM: A mistake, in this situation. Without J15, it might be playable.]

(;B[em];W[dn];B[eo]C[This was a misread on my part.  I thought I could cut him off, but there was no chance after F8.  I probably should have defended differently, but even without this, it's a lost game anyways.

NM: Yes, I think so. See variation if you defend correctly here - W still seems to be about 25 points ahead.]
