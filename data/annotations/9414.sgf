AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello, I'm Elom and I'll mark my notes with Elom:

Elom: I feel that I slowly lost points throughout all stages of the game. The problem is thst it's difficult for me to judge weather a position is good or not, espescially in the opening.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game, your help is greatly appreciated.

Hello, I'm Julien (2k). I'll mark my comments with Julien.]
;W[fc]C[KTL: hi
Elom [7k\]: Hello, good game!];B[cf];W[nc];B[kc]C[Elom:Was this move okay?

Julien: Extending on the right side or doing a pincer is almost a matter of style here. Your move is more agressive than the other option, but fully playable.]
;W[ic]
(;B[oc]C[Exchanging P17 for O16 is usually good with a stone at L17 in order to make O17 heavy. But it is maybe not so good here since L17 is itself weak after J17. Maybe playing Q14 directly, or playing L15 would be better.]
;W[nd];B[pf]C[Elom: Should this be at P15 instead?

Julien: No, this move is the standard pattern after P17.];W[qc]

(;B[pc]C[P18 is more usual: the shape is better and it attacks the corner and the top at the same time. In this particular case, it also works better with L17.]
;W[rd];B[ke];W[nf]
(;B[rf]C[S15 is usual here (see variations).];W[rb];B[nb]C[Elom: I'm not sure this was a good move.

Julien: a bit stange. Q18 is more natural to force white to leave gote with few points.]
;W[pb]C[Elom: Unexpected.];B[mb];W[ob];B[oh];W[nh]
(;B[og]C[Julien: bad kikashi: it strengthens white without getting anything. Also kikashi from the other side would be perhaps better latter.]
;W[lf]
(;B[kf]C[Elom: Is N13 playable?

Julien. No. This move is ok. You have 2 targets here (F17 and O14): you have to choose which one you want to attack, then strenghten first again the other one. Here, it means that you plan to attack F17.]
;W[ng];B[oj];W[kg]
(;B[hd]C[Elom: I'm not sure, but I think this might be a fatal slip.

Julien. It is locally not so good (either J16 or J15 is more usual). It is a bit unconsistent with L14: you are changing your target.]

(;W[hc]C[Now, F17 is no more an easy target.];B[jg]C[Julien: why playing H16 before? A ladder breaker? Not necessary I guess.]
;W[kh];B[ni];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[lj]C[Very good result. Black prospect at the bottom is impressive.]
;W[jh]
(;B[jb]C[Elom: Is J15 better?

Julien: error of direction. That is a big mistake. You have to escape into the center before trying to leave locally (and small).]
;W[ig]C[Julien: now white gets the initiative.];B[fd]C[Elom: This seems to have made things difficult for me.]
;W[id]C[Elom: I missed the counter-attack.];B[ie]
(;W[gd]C[Elom: Wasn't this move slightly passive];B[he];W[ge]
C[Julien: because of K18, your position is collapsing.];B[hf]
;W[ed]C[Elom: Now the situation has apparently reversed.

Julien: yes it is. Because of K18 which is a yose move which does not take into accound the whole board position and lose the initiative.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[ff];W[dc];B[gf];W[cd];B[ef];W[de]
(;B[gc]C[Julien: bad move: very small. A best yose move would be G18. And it would be a yose move only. You have to play at a larger scale.]
;W[gb];B[kq]C[Julien: playing on the 4th lines is better when you have a moyo. K4 would be better here (also because of K10).]
;W[qn]
(;B[qo]C[Elom: this move starts a lot of confusion.];W[pn]
(;B[ql]C[Bad move. You're strong on this side. You have to play the other side.]
;W[pl];B[pk]C[Elom: should R10 be played instead?

Julien: R10 would be very bad. This one looks ok. R9 would be a bit submissive.]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[ok];B[pj];W[op]C[Julien: yeah... You're very weak here.]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[oo]C[Elom: I think R3 could be the proper move here.

Julien. The mistake was R8. You have no way to resist easily here because you're too weak.]

;W[qr];B[rq];W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[om];W[cn]
(;B[fp];W[bp];B[cl]TR[df]C[Julien: another error of direction. There is not a lot of points on the left side because of the weakness at D14. So playing here is not important.]

;W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh]C[Elom: was it better to connect solidly at D12?

Julien: this move is ok. White has still to answer at B14 and you're very strong here.]

(;B[ll]C[Elom: Is there more I could have done after this fatal slip?

Julien: probably since you are still a bit ahead ;). I'm not a yose expert but you have to play first double sente move, next sente (or reverse-sente) moves and finally gote moves. You play too many gote moves.]

I'd like to know some of the main areas I need to work on to help improve please.

I'd also like to know of any litrature that may  help me
Thanks, Elom.

==========

Julien: I think the more important things is to improve your direction of play. Your stones have to work together better. When you have a moyo, the most important things is to develop it at a large scale. Also, splitting attacks are important.

You also plays too many bad shapes which let weaknesses in your position.

Maybe you could read "the direction of play" (by a japanese author, but I forgot his name) and do more tsumego/tesuji problems.

I hope my comments is useful for you. Let me know if you have any additional questions.
