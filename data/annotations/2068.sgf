C[pajaro:
Hi. In this game I was playing as white, and I lost big. I can't understand
loosing, but nearly fifty points... I played a thickness oriented fuseki,
and I got some territory. But I think that I couldn't turn my power into
profit. I also know that I made some tactical mistakes but, are they so big?
Please, I need mostly some strategical advises.

Thanks

Hubert (1 dan) : This game is a moyo against moyo game.
In this kind of game, direction of play is very important.
Each "small" mistake cost a lot of points. The problem is you
 can make many such  mistakes without realizing that something  wrong occur.

When you play san-ra-sei (three hoshis in a row), you play with
the idea of hard fighting. The fighting will occur in the center,
so you must PLAY HIGH in the opening to accumulate more and more  power before the fight.   The purpose of a stone on the third line is to make territory  (or to prevent the opponent to make territory), hence, it's not
so good when you are playing san-ra-sei..

In the openings, black was doing better.
In the middle game, black made many OVERPLAYS.
With all your thickness, you should have play more agressively
and could have destroyed him.

During the game, you have made a series of good moves   in the invasion of the LR corner.
You are good to play light ans fast.
So a strategy for you could be to play for territory in the opening
(3-4 point or 3-3 points instead of hoshi ) then invade the moyo of the opponent.

But you still have to learn to use thickness

REMEMBER :

1.When you have thicness :
CUT & FIGHT, PLAY BOLDLY.

2. When your opponent has thickness.
PLAY SOLID, BE CAREFULL.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[dj]
LB[po:a][jp:b]C[Here we are. Both player play fast.
In a moyo against moyo, the classical strategy
 is to make the biggest moyo to force the opponent  to invade fisrt then to attack him.

Because black play first, he will normally have the advantage
 in this reasonning. But not always bacause he also want to play
Q5 (Fist K4 then Q5) to make good shimari shape.  Either strategy is good for black.

Because of your san-ra-sei, you prefer to be invaded than
 to invade because the san-ra-sei works very well in attack.  But your power works well to invade too, so either way is fair.]
;B[fc]
(;W[ic]C[Hubert :
This move is very bad.
The correct move is J16 here.
K16 is playable too but not severe enough.
(H17 is possible too but the reasonning behind is not easy to grasp)

In a moyo game, one line different change everything.
J17 is very bad, J16 is very good.

J16 is THE NATURAL MOVE here.
On the fourth line (see var)];B[cc];W[dc]C[Hubert : Wrong direction.  Even in this situation, you must make a wall. Because of J17,
 your wall will have a defect.
But it's better than to abandon your formation like this.];B[cd]
;W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]TR[cf][dj]C[Hubert : Look at the D14- D10 relationship.

D10 is on the fourth line, he doesn't make any territory.  But he has a lot of POWER.
This power is good for ATTACKING.
If you want to attack, your opponent must have WEAK STONES wich
will be your TARGET.

Here, D14 is a STRONG stone, firmly sitting on the third line and alive.
This stone is mocking D10.
Now you will have no target to attack, half the power of D10 is destroyed.
(You still have influence in the center)

This result is VERY GOOD for black.]
(;W[fd]C[Hubert : This move is SLOW.
It's not necessary.

In a moyo game, you must play FAST THEN SOLID.
Here you play solid first.

See var];B[fq];W[iq]C[Hubert : Same];B[cq];W[cp]C[Hubert : Better, you learn fast.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[go]LB[hp:a]C[Hubert : Do you see the defect at a.  Sooner or later, it will cause problems.]
;B[cj]C[Hubert : Bad move, punish it !]
(;W[ck]C[pajaro: Right direction?

Hubert : I don't think so.  I feel you cannot make much territory here.
Your wall (C4-D4-E4-G5) must be used for attack, not for making territory.

THIS IS A GOLDEN RULE : USE WALL FOR ATTACK.

So the correct idea is to cut black
 from his main group.
SEE var];B[ci];W[di]TR[fd]LB[dk:a]C[Hubert : It's a good idea to make a wall  BUT :

1. Now F16 will become a wasted stone  (overconcentration)

2. I don't see how you can make a wall without defect.];B[dh]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[eg];B[lp]C[Hubert : Black is doing well here, his moyo is growing
and the H4 defect becomes aparent.];W[df];B[ce]
(;W[mc]C[Hubert : Why not O17 ?
Or better O16 (see var)
This is slack.]
(;B[jd]C[Hubert : Funny,  black has a won game and he is just trying to loose here
(see var)]
(;W[jc]C[Hubert : NOOOOOOOOOOOO !
So slack !
Black gives you a TARGET .
FIGHT ! ATTACK ! KILL ! NO PITY !
(see var)];B[kd]C[Hubert : heavy.];W[kc];B[ob]LB[oi:a][oj:b]
[ok:c][pj:d][oe:e][of:f]C[pajaro:
Up to here, I think I have a powerful position and little territory, and
black has the opposite.

Hubert :
Yes , black is heavy (K16-L16 is a burden), and his last move  is in the wrong direction.
The game will be gained (or lost) in the center.
Ther corner is very very small.

BUT : It will be difficult to attack black.

Your stategy is to attack from very far.
a,b,c,d are good points.
Sooner or later, you will have to play e and f giving black a large corner.]

(;W[qo]C[Hubert : Wrong direction.  Don't try to live in a small place when there
are bigger uncharted areas.

Now, the game is lost.
 You will loose time just to leave and
 black will make thickness to match yours.];B[qp];W[pl]C[Hubert : Good light move.]
;B[ql];W[oo];B[nq];W[pk];B[pj];W[nl]LB[oj:a]C[Hubert : The hane at P10 is better : Never forget :
with your wall, play boldly !];B[nj]C[Hubert : O10 is better]
;W[qi]LB[lo:a]C[Hubert : too direct.  This area will not becomes black territory (too many defects)
Flee first (M5 for example)];B[pm]C[Hubert : black MUST connect]
;W[om];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[qj]C[Hubert : white is happy. White wants is a big fight in the center.
Black seems to help him.];B[qg]
(;W[oj]C[Hubert : Atari is always bad shape.
So see what happens if you try another way (see var)];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[mi];B[jg];W[qm]C[Hubert : doen't work.]

(;B[qn]C[Hubert : Blunder.];W[qh];B[pg];W[rm]C[pajaro:
Now the balance of territory seems more equal, and white is still stronger.
White should be able to win. Or not?

Hubert : Lets count :

Black : 20 UL + 10 LL + 15 LR + 20 UR = 65
White : 10 R + 15 U + 15 L + komi= 45

White needs
a) 20 points in the center to win.
b) to repare the defect at H4.

It is possible for white to win but I prefer black's position.

If I'm Black, I just play H4 and  EITHER I destroy the center
OR I take 20 more points on the side.];B[jj];W[ji]C[Hubert : Difficult to find the correct move here. Your idea seems correct.]
;B[ii]
(;W[ij]C[Hubert : Bad shape.
CROSSCUT RULE :
In a crosscut, is better the player

a) Who can abandon some stones (light shape in the enemy territory)
b) Who has a stone near
c) who play first
(in that order)

Here black verify the 3 conditions so he is far better.];B[ki]
;W[jh];B[kh];W[ih]
(;B[hi]C[hubert : Black will loose evereything playing thant bold.]

(;W[jk]C[Hubert : not necessary.
The shisho is not good for black.
He you have not to play atari, DON'T !
(always bad shape because you loose the  possibility of the other atari, very important here)]
;B[kj];W[hh]C[hubert : better at J13.
Better to lean against the stone you don't want to capture.
The opponent defends. Then you will capture.];B[he]C[hubert : Tesuji ahead.]

(;W[gd]C[Hubert : Bad move. Not necessary];B[hj];W[ik]C[pajaro: Mistake. I should help the H12 group.
Hubert : YES. But if black make a ponuki, you are badly off too,
so the problem was earlier.];B[gh];W[hk];B[gi];W[fj]C[hubert : Now the game is lost.
You should RESIGN here.
No comment after this point.
Black has taken the center and H4 defect is still here. No hope.]
