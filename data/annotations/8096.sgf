;B[dp];W[pd];B[ce];W[pp];B[nc];W[jd];B[qf];W[pf];B[pe]C[This Move confused me, i had expected R17 or Q13.
I think cutting at R15 doesn't work, because the ladder is good for black (thanks to D4)]
;W[oe];B[qe]
(;W[od]C[ch: P16 is solid, but P17 might eliminate some aji in the corner.]
;B[of]
(;W[pg]C[ch: looks dangerous.  To be honest, I cannot read the variations involved now.]
(;B[qg]C[ch: wrong direction.];W[ph]
(;B[nf]C[ch: tough.];W[qd];B[ri]
(;W[qj]C[Probably a misread by me. I didn't thought he would even considering cutting.
I probably should have just jumped (Q10) - exchanging R12-S12 before jumping?

ch: q10 is lukewarm. S10 is ok, I think.];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj]

;B[kf];W[lg]C[I'm not so sure about this sequence. During the game i thought it was the best i could get. Living in the corner and securing my center group by capturing O14.
However the black strength towards the upper left corner is great. At least i got sente.

Is there any other way i could have played?];B[jc]TR[oa][pa]

[nf][of][ng][og][nh][oh][oi]SQ[ja][jb][kc][rg][sg][sh][si][qj]
[rj][sj][qk][rk]C[ch: the w corner is around 30p territory.
b territory is only 13p , but b has some thickness on the upper side.

I think, the position is slightly favorable for white.];W[kg]
;B[id]
(;W[fq]LB[cc:B][dc:A]C[ch: Now, you should invade at A or B. Another b move here,  and the corner gets huge.
The lower side is not urgent.];B[ip];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[cj]C[I thought he couldn't accomplish anything with E3. But that proved to be a misreading :(

ch: the exchange g4/g5 was bad for you.];B[eq];W[er];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[fr];W[ds];B[gr];W[kq]C[ch: This is gote, because after k4 you should answer. Thus, better play on the left side directly.]
;B[jq];W[cg];B[bp]
(;W[aq];B[ee]
(;W[cc]C[E15 looked extremly high, so i thought i should live underneath.

ch: a bit risky. Now you got 2 weak groups. Easier would be like in the variation.]
;B[dc]LB[bb:B][db:A][bd:C]C[ch: ok, now you live easily, but what happens after b A ,B or C. Are you sure to live?]
;W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[ec];W[bb];B[bd];W[bc]
(;B[be]C[ch: Too small. The invasion was a success for w. You lived in sente! Congratulations.]
;W[bm]C[As my corner was alive i thought about securing my group on the left. Especially as B15 looked dangerous to me.
ch: not really dangerous. Living on the side or escaping in the center should be miai.]
;B[eb];W[ca]C[Should i have played E18 before B7?

ch: no, otherwise c10 would have been attacked.];B[bh]
(;W[bg]C[I didn't want to answer in the way he wanted. Also i read, that he couldn't cut me.

ch: b is very thick on the left side, thus you have to be careful. IMHO connecting with c12 would be normal.]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[ck];W[cl];B[bl];W[dk];B[bk];W[dm]
;B[al]C[Now he lives. I never thought he could live there on the second line, but he did..
I think, at that point i'm already behind

ch: The black invasion is no problem. Just 2 point for b, and strength for w.
You could consider to play tenuki at the big point L4]
(;W[gh]LB[an:A]C[Without a base, i thought my group could easily become attacked, so i tried to connect it to my other center group. Maybe G13 would be more threatening towards the upper black territory? (So that i gain sente)

ch: the c10 group is not weak. You can connect, because A is sente on the B10 group.]
;B[nq]C[ch: this is very big];W[pr];B[kp]C[ch: Think about L4. It is huge!]
;W[qn];B[el];W[dl];B[pn];W[qo];B[ll]
(;W[lq]C[With m8 black gained a lot secure points in the lower center. I thought i should try something with the aji i got.

ch: m3 is heavy! Try to use the aji indirectly];B[np];W[ln]
C[ch: again, this is too deep inside of the opponents strength]
;B[mm];W[qm];B[ik]MA[ln][lq]C[ch: if b succeeds in capturing the marked stones on a large scale, you are clearly behind. That is why m3 and m6 are  bad.]
;W[mn];B[nn];W[nm];B[on];W[lk]
(;B[kk]
(;W[ml]C[ch: too small];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[kj];B[jl];W[lj]
MA[ln][mn][kq][lq]C[I secured my points in the center, but also solidfy blacks territory. I don't think it was that good.
Somehow i'm very bad at reducing, so i'm not sure where i should have played instead of this sequence.

ch: w is overconcentrated, and the aji of the marked stones has nearly vanished. Big success for b.]
;B[ej];W[dj];B[eh];W[eg];B[fg];W[ei];B[fh];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj]
C[I think he now becomes greedy, which allows me to reduce his center more than i should be able to.

ch: I agree. There is still hope :-)];B[ek]
(;W[em]C[ch: Possible in this situation. But in general, you should avoid pushing from behind.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[hi];W[hj];B[ij];W[gl]C[ch: nice move!];B[hl]
;W[fl];B[jg]
(;W[ii]C[ch: cutting 2 strong groups is not really a thread. Just playing at J12 is much better.]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[if];W[jh];B[jf]MA[ii]C[ch: now you see, that J11 is a lost move. It even costs a liberty.]
;W[ea];B[fa];W[da]C[ch: because you are behind in territory you could consider to play a ko]

I was afraid of black playing S3 if i connect.
