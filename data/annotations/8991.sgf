C[Pauzle: Thanks to whoever reviews this. I'm mostly concered with the first 30 moves or so, so please comment on any mistakes either me or balimuna made in that span. Besides that, there was that group on the left side that I think I could have killed. Feel free to comment on anything though.

Ben.  I trired to focus my comments on the first 30 moves as you suggested.  This is really where the game was the most important.  It's difficult to judge either player by the moves they make in a single game but my suggestion would be for you to focus more on building strong solid groups first before attacking as I believe this is what lead to what should have been a lost game for you.  Black suffered from somewhat the opposite problem, making some groups too concentrated and not attacking and exploiting white's weak areas enough.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq]C[Ben.  If white let's him, usually black takes the corner around d4 and this is thought to be advantageous by denying white the possibility of establishing a pair of "connected" corners.  But as we see here black is sticking to his guns.]
;W[po]C[Ben.  The best move probably would be to just occupy the open corner and let black reveal his plan.]
;B[dp]C[Ben.  A fine move.];W[qq]C[Ben.  This seems like a possibility, approaching at c6 seems like a viable alternative.]
(;B[pp]C[Ben. See the variation.];W[qp];B[mq]C[Ben.  This is probably as awkward as it looks but maybe q4 wasn't the right move to start with.]
;W[pf]C[Ben.  My first instinct would be to shore up my stones on the bottom first.  The black stones there are if nothing else strong.]
;B[qh]C[Ben.  I believe o16 is the usual response to this rare approach.]
;W[nd];B[qf]C[Ben.  I wonder if this can be split?]
(;W[pg];B[qg];W[hp]C[Ben.  What was the purpose of this move?  It's difficult for me to see how this should help you, it doesn't create significant problems for black and you will have to fight now to keep this stone alive.]
;B[jp];W[hn]SQ[hp]C[Ben.  I wonder about just leaving the marked stone as a probe and doing something like p15 (or q15, r15, p16) or c6?]
;B[de]C[Ben.  Black got the approach move on this side of the board first.  White might consider tenuki here as he has a lot of weak groups yet.  For instance see the variation.]
(;W[dh]C[Ben.  The pincer is sharp but possible other moves could have been better.]
;B[ch]C[Ben.  I have not seen this move in similar positions before.  See the variation for another possible approach for white.]
(;W[ci];B[cg];W[dj];B[cc]C[Ben.  D16 doesn't really seem to work out in my view.  See the variation for an alternative.]
(;W[dd];B[cd];W[ee];B[df]C[Ben.  Go for the gusto with e14, of course black will cut but it seems like white should try to do something.]
(;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]C[Ben.  Black can and should just go c5.  See variation.]
(;B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cm]C[Ben.  Now black becomes thick and white's group on c11 becomes solid.]
;B[go];W[gn]C[Ben.  This is a little fancy, why not just h5?]
;B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[jo];B[kp];W[fo];B[gp];W[fp];B[gq];W[fq]
;B[hq];W[er]C[Ben.  The tactics on this side of the board are quite tempting but there are still big points to be had elsewhere, f16, p15, r8..]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[en];W[dr];B[cn];W[gl];B[bn];W[nf];B[br];W[cr]
C[Ben.  It actually becomes a life and death problem.  White should prefer b3 here instead.  See the variation.
