(;B[pn]MA[op]C[[Nick George\]: This move is not joseki, and I don't really like it.  The thing about the 45 point, like X, is that it's more for influence on the side than corner territory.  By approaching high and outside the coner, let white seal off a large corner, and his potential on the bottom is still high.  See black variation for possible joseki]
;W[qo]C[big corner];B[pj]MA[qo]LB[qn:A]C[This move too weak?  I considered Q8 or Q9.
R6 is also possible

[NickGeorge\]: I feel this is about right, any closer would feel cramped.  The bigger problem is that I feel like you're trying to make territory on the right, which isn't really legit anymore thanks to X.  As a rule of thumb, if your opponent has a stone lower than one of yours, don't try to make territory there. A move as simple as S7 would be very costly by white.  If you want side territory, you'll need to play A at some point, which would be very slow, as it is gote.]

[Nick George\]:  It's a tough one.  The critical thing to consider is that white's H3 group becomes VERY weak if you answer the peep.  D2 really is sente against it.  I'd see it continuing like this:]

The general rule is to block to the side where you can make more territory.  A wall facing R13/P13 is of little use]

(;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]C[I debated a good while if to play s15, but I felt too vulnerable to do it, esp. with the p13 stones.  Considering the gameline, is seems that that is the better choice?  Is there a better continuation than my own?]

Not bad.  You cashed in on a lot of white mistakes, and that's always fun. 

Remember that the best kinds of territory are those that you don't force, they kind of arise organically.  The proverb says that you never use walls to make territory, it's innefficient.  Instead, use that power to attack and exert influence over that area of the board.  It's fun to use walls to build monster moyos, and then force your opponent to invade, so you can attack them for fun and profit. 

Good stuff!
