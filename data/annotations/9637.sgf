I dont have alot of points, this is my only shot at winning :(

> I think you have the wrong idea about this.  You traded territory for influence.  That doesn't mean you are behind.  It does mean you need to use your influence, but you don't even have to kill those black stones (although you have a decent chance I think).

You are still threatening to make a lot of points along the top, and maybe on the left.  Don't Panic!]

Too difficult to kill black. Dont know what to do with my influence.

The game from here onwards is uninteresting.
