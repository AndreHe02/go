C[This is my game (as W) with a stronger player (B 9k, W 18k) on DGS. Please revue it and emphasize my major mistakes.

Thank you.

Velirun: No problem.  I will go over both your and your opponent's major mistakes.  If you have more detailed questions, please contact me directly and I will be happy to answer them for you.]

C[Velirun:  Most professionals won't approach between in 2-star position if they can approach on the outside.  I think a pincer should be expected.]
;B[dn];W[dr];B[gq]C[now it starts a sequence unexpected for me. why B choose to attack so close and how should i responde?

Velirun:  This is a very complicated modern joseki.  It emphasizes the left side here.  Fortunately, almost no one you come across will know it, and your best bet is just to stay calm and try to read ahead.

Velirun: Personally, I think I would start with a hane on top.  To be honest, I'm not sure how it would progress though.]
;W[fo]C[Velirun:  An interesting start.  However, with black's original intention of taking the bottom side, I think he should start as in the variation.]

;B[bo];W[br];B[dl]C[as it looks, W wins the corner, but B secures the left side and builds a wall on the bottom side. where was W wrong?

Velirun:  I would say the jump was your mistake.  You must now take measures to look after your three stones that have become separated.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[nq]C[Velirun:  It seems you are willing to give those stones up for now?]
;B[lq];W[io];B[ho];W[gm];B[gn];W[en];B[em]C[I was lucky....]
;W[do];B[fn];W[eo]C[Velirun:  Even though you captured three stones and rescued three of your own, note that your position on the outside is in tatters.  I don't think this is a good result for you.  I would immediately turn my attention towards attacking the one stone at M3, perhaps with a jump at O5.  You may be able to stabilize your groups in the face of black's wall.]
;B[fm];W[hm];B[cm];W[no]C[Velirun:  Good.];B[lo];W[pn];B[pr]
;W[jd]C[Velirun:  Not so good.  There is a fight going on - don't stop to take territory.  How about a night's move at N7 to attack, or a cap at M7?]
;B[lm]C[Velirun:  Black takes the vital point.];W[jj];B[in]
;W[im];B[jn]C[the 2 stones at j3 and j5 looked quite weak, i "dismissed" them.

Velirun:  At this point, I think this is for the best.  You get a position on the outside.]

;W[pj]C[Velirun:  This should be one space further - Q11.  Your wall is very powerful.]

(;W[mc]C[Velirun:  I would suggest learning the attacking joseki starting with R15.  It is well worth your time to study!  See variations for some possibilities.]

;B[re];W[pi];B[qb];W[pb];B[rb];W[mj];B[of]C[Velirun:  He decides his weak stones are worth fighting for.  You should delight in attacking them now - you have lots of power to back it up.]

C[the previous series of B moves in the centre look a little hazardous to me? what was the point? i thought that was a try to get off the B p13 group.

Velirun: This isn't so horrible for black.  He should never count on pulling his four stones out.  Instead, he built a position on the outside.]
;W[ol];B[jl];W[hk];B[jk];W[kj];B[if]C[Velirun:  Black's mistake.  Should be a ladder.]
;W[he];B[ij];W[hj];B[ii];W[gh]C[Velirun:  Black's thick position from before is now used to attack your cut-off white stones at H7.]

(;B[ab];W[af]C[unfortunately, i was prety sure that W group is still alive

Velirun:  If you can build up enough liberties, you can play A17, then connect at C19, then kill the group.  However, I don't think this is possible.

Velirun:  Note that black can also start a ko at C19 any time.]
