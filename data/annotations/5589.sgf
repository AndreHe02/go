C[Hi mircofanti!!

I don't know if I can be of any help as a mere 5k, but I'll try to give you some good advice anyway (excuse me if my english is no good, I'm not an english speaker).

Obviously your opponent was better in this game (a 10k killer:) ), actually I believe he was teaching you in this game so I don't know his real level, he may be 4kyu or 2dan...

But anyway, you seem to think a lot and I am sure it will pay soon.

The first 11 moves were ok, don't worry too much about them. My feeling is that you are too greedy for territory in this game. You should try to be more patient, this is the way for a more constructive game.

Regards,

;W[jd];B[qo]MA[jq][pq]LB[qf:1]C[This move is probably too defensive and greedy for territory.
Black should play somewhere near the left side, as the White cut between the two marked stones is not a good move for the moment.
But again, don't worry too much about the first 11 moves' shape. 

ulys];W[kp]C[This is the first problem I found in this game. I didn't know how to answer in order to block the invasion and to get influence to the centre.

mircofanti]
(;B[lq]C[In any go game, a player would avoid to be cut unless he has a very VERY good reason. Try to keep this in mind for the rest of the review.

As a consequence, one would avoid something like M3.

Personnally, I do the following : I think about L3 here, and after that only I look if there is something better.

Have a look at the variant...

;W[ne];B[of];W[pn]C[White is reckless here: he think you are a weakling, you should punish him...

ulys]
(;B[nn]C[...but don't try to kill him when you are not absolutely sure you can : go isn't a life or death game.

ulys];W[qn];B[po];W[on];B[oo];W[nm]
(;B[om]C[Okay, I would have played the same here. But I dunno if it is the best answer.

C[Now I looked for the way to invade the white territory
The idea was invading 3 areaa (A, B, C) to get at least 2 alive.

mircofanti


Think about the best one, because invading both A and B, or B and C, and even A and C seem presomptuous to me.

ulys];B[cf]C[Okay, good try

ulys];W[ce]
(;B[ch]C[D14 and following is more joseki-like.

ulys];W[cj];B[eg]TR[dg]C[Bad extension as D13 point is still a weak point

C[This move is your first big strategical mistake, others were tactical. 
As you are losing control of the game (since move 52), you are throwing desperate stones on the board.

;B[nl];W[mm]LB[cn:C]C[Now I was trying to get territory into the centre leaving the C invasion later, trying to connect to somewhere.
What i wonder is: was it too difficult to invade the A, B, C area (so a strategical lack) or was the moves that I've done that were not so effective (so a tactical problem)?

mircofanti


As I said before, I think the answer is more : "too difficult to invade the A, B, C area"

ulys];B[lk];W[nj]
(;B[li]TR[nj]C[This move is mild and undecided : Do you REALLY whant to kill White O10 here ? You must decide !!!
Black N11 is very risky but more convincing
L7 would have been my move (but don't take it as the best move)...

ulys];W[pk];B[ok]TR[oj]C[Black P10 better
