AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello Vernon,
My name is JT, and I play a very aggressive, risky style. Keep that in mind as I review. I'll try to present a more traditional sort of suggestion, but I might miss something for that reason. I'm currently ranked about 6kyu.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[cj]C[JT: Any particular reason this isn't at C11? I'll be curious what happens to this group as the game progresses. There's no reason to leave w the C12 followup that I can see.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[rd]C[vernon: I know that R18 is typical.
JT: I'm not familiar with this joseki, but I would have played R16. Shows you what I know.]
;W[jq];B[nq]C[JT: This is the first move that really feels like a choice to me - everything before this has been sort of "reasonable" in the way that most early moves are reasonable in handicap games.
I think this is too passive. If your goal is to pressure K3, this should be at N3 in stead.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[vernon: In hindsight this is a thank you move. Where would be better?

JT: I don't know the term "thank you move," but this turns his very weak, exploratory group into a solid one. I would recommend taking advantage of your stronger local position and played H3.]
;W[fp];B[dn]C[vernon: Perhaps on third line to defend the corner better.

JT: This is not a significant misplay, if a misplay at all. If white attacks it to lots of success later, it's because he's a stronger fighter than you are, not because this move is weak.]
;W[qk];B[qo]C[JT: Again a very passive response. You're playing like you have a lead to throw away, and can afford to let him take points to stay safe. To pressure, play no more than two spaces away, at R6. In this specific place, with, again, much local thickness to work with, I would even try R7.]
;W[qg]
(;B[qf]C[vernon: Another thank you move. A possible alternative would be Q13. What would you suggest.

JT: In this case, more than at E3, this move is reasonable, if only because of your awkward weak spot at R15. Still, though, your error is definitely passivity. R11 is not the correct play, but possibly Q13? I'll play it out a bit.]
;W[pg];B[pj]C[vernon: Perhaps L17 is bigger.

JT: This is good; you're finally trying to take advantage of his small, weak groups. I agree with this attack.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[kc];B[ef]TR[nf]C[The triangle is much more at risk of being capped; E14 is only slightly smaller, I think, but this is the sort of thing that allows your opponent a center, so I'm mentioning it anyway.]
;W[cq]C[vernon: I hadn't realized that this had always been open.]
;B[dq];W[cr]
(;B[dr]TR[cp]C[JT: This is a mistake. You cannot kill this; you should be trying to conserve territory here.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[bn]C[vernon: I hadn't expected this move. I was thinking B4.]
;B[cl];W[in];B[pl]C[vernon: What would you suggest? P14 might be stronger.

JT: In this position, *I personally* would play R11. Not because I've read the fight and I know it'll go well; just because I'd be annoyed that this group was so strong.  If you're going in the direction of P14, though, go bigger: P13. Q8 does very little.]
;W[of]
(;B[rf];W[rg]C[These two moves take your solid group and his floating group to your *precisely identically point-valued* solid group and his now completely solid 10-point strongpoint.]
;B[fn];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[no]C[This seems questionable now.

JT: It's just so small. Try H8, R8, G5, H17... anything more productive.]
;W[mm];B[ql]C[It's good to get this move out of the way. Has to happen at some point. Still, though, makes you wish Q8 had been somewhere else.]
;W[pi];B[oi]C[vernon: Should this have been elsewhere, like O9?

Elsewhere, perhaps O9, probably not. In that area, I think N9 is strongest; I would personally go for G5.]
;W[oj]C[vernon: W later said this move signaled that he was trying to build a big center.

He's committing to killing P11. Your job is to take as much from him as possible while he does that.]
;B[nj]C[vernon: I try to pull a fancy move from "Making Good Shape" but I end up making W very thick on the right center. Was this a good play?]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[ml];W[ni];B[lk];W[mj];B[qi]
C[vernon: Perhaps grabbing the two stones on the side was too small. Would M7 be better?]
;W[oh];B[ri];W[ll]TR[ni][qi][ri][mj][oj][qj][rj][mk][nk][ok]
[qk][rk]C[This is a 12-point swing for a fully live group in the middle. But, I think the game will probably sufficiently advise you on that point.]
;B[lm];W[kl];B[mn];W[gf]TR[qi][ri][qj][rj][qk][rk][ml][nl][ol]
[pl][lm][mm][nm][om][pm][mn][nn][on]C[vernon: Now the thick right can prevent me from jumping into the center behind this stone. How should I have reduced this giant center?

JT: I see a bit better now what you were trying to do these past few moves. Your total gains are marked. But, you are completely covered on the right.

It's easy to say "Don't get completely covered," and if you watch for it, that advice will work. But in stead, whenever you see strong pieces on top of your groups, get a little feeling of claustrophobia. That should always make you uncomfortable. It "looks" in the moment like you have points and their floating group is useless, but if its strong, its a sign your opponent will be accumulating points much faster than you for the rest of the game. So, as far back as P14, I would have been looking to poke up.]
;B[fh]C[This is absolutely the correct course of play at this point; just, as you mentioned, a little late.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[gi]
(;B[go]C[vernon: with the huge center, I knew I had to attack. Could I have gotten away with H5? See variation.]
;W[hp];B[jn]C[vernon: This failed. Would L7 work better?];W[km]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[ko];W[lo];B[kp];W[kq];B[hn];W[im];B[io];W[ho]
;B[gp];W[gq]C[vernon: W paused a long time here, and counted carefully. I am one move behind.]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[hr];W[gr];B[gs];W[fs]C[vernon: I had missed this reply. If W plays J2, B kills.]
;B[hs];W[ir];B[es];W[fr]
(;B[hm]C[vernon: My E1 creates a threat to the lower left corner by C1. I missed that threat. See variation.

That fight was very complicated, but not your main problem in this game, so I'm not going to look at it in too much depth. In fact, I think I'll take this opportunity to conclude my serious reviewing - endgame is also not your biggest problem. If you're in a dead heat coming into the end of a handicap game, you're probably going to lose. Sad fact of life. I'll comment sparsely for the rest of the game, then post summary comments at the end of the game, when I have a finished board to draw on.]

;W[el];B[ej];W[fo];B[gn];W[fm];B[em];W[hk];B[dl];W[bc]C[vernon: This move seems big.

It's enormous. Some thing like fifteen points, if I remember.]
;B[be];W[cs]C[vernon: W finally locks down the lower right corner from the C1 attack.]
;B[eo]C[vernon: I remove aji before attacking the lower left corner.]
;W[is];B[bm]C[vernon: Hey, I finally found a sente move.];W[ar]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[fd];W[gc]C[vernon: I think G16 is a disaster for the corner.]

(;B[lr]C[vernon: After the game, W pointed out this should be at M3 for a sente move. See variation for path. I followed that variation with reasonable play (IMHO), and W wins by 23.]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[mo];B[nn];W[lq];B[kr]C[vernon: After game, W said this move was so bad it inspired him to attack because it opened up good cutting points. He starts by eliminating aji on the board.

It doesn't look terrible to me; how strong is white?];W[gl]

 W had estimated the count and thought I was ahead by 5 points on the board, whereas he was ahead by over 20 points.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[rr]C[You're correct that you need to kill this. Looks scary, though.]

(;B[ps]C[vernon: My biggest blunder of the game, which loses 28 points. N1 saves the N3 group and kills the corner. I forgot that his T1 is sente because of the throw in. See variation. I followed that variation, and W wins by about 31 points.]
