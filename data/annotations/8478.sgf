;B[pd]C[Hi, My name is Gus and I'll be happy to review the game. I'll try to prefix my comments with Gus:

Overview - The game is pretty evenly matched. You don't seem to have any glaring weaknesses, but your reading needs work (doesn't everyone's?). It seems from your comments that you have a strange fear of komoku by white. You need to study the komoku joskeki and get over your fear so that you can play a game you are comfortable with.

The other thing to work on, is you have a tendency to make vauge moves in open space.  You seem to want to play influence oriented go, but the point of influence is to have an advantage in the fight. You should be itching for your oponent to make a weak group and then your main focus should be to get profit from pushing on the weak group you let 2 and 3 stones hang out forever in the center.]
;W[dc];B[dp]LB[pp:A][pq:B]C[i don't play diagonal fuseki that often, but i also don't like to grant my opponents an advantage from a komoku-opening

Gus: komoku does not grant an advantage. There's no reason to play diagonal here if you don't want to. I also prefer parallel, and it's perfectly fine to play, A or B here. I like san-ren-sei so I usually play A. If you review pro games, you will find thousands of examples of A or B in this position. D will probably be less common than either of those because of the popularity of san-ren-sei, chinese, and kobayashi openings any of which could be played here. However, there's nothing wrong with diagonal either.]
;W[qp];B[op]C[in accordance with the influence-strategy of the hoshi stones

Gus: Lots of posibilities, even low aproaches possibly, but in any case this is ok.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq]
(;B[nm]C[haha, this move is weird, but as the game goes, it could potentially work really well. let's wait

Gus: This seems a bit loose for a diagonal game. large moyos are less common in diagonal games, and so if I wind up in a diagonal game, I tend not to do this sort of thing. This is not terrible, but I feel it's a bit vague and would prefer to take a base.]
(;W[qn]C[that seems to timid in relation to blacks latest move

Gus: Perhaps, but it's quite solid too If it's slack it's only a point or two slack...]
;B[de]C[influence];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[pj]TR[nm]C[now the marked stone doesn't look that bad. white's territory in bottom right is huge, but so is black's moyo

Gus: Actually, Janice Kim callse the relationship between those two stones the "broken horse".]
(;W[jd]C[Seems timid.  You shoudl be able to take a lead here]
;B[dg]C[Gus: GOOD :) fixing your weakness is perfect. Hard for white to ignore too.]
(;W[fc]C[Gus: This white is timid again. Why not complete the joseki?]
(;B[iq]LB[np:A]C[playing low seems odd with the cut at A still in place, and inconsistent with your previous influence oriented strategy. You can't easily switch strategies in the middle.]

(;B[di]TR[ej]C[decisive loosing move. keima would have been better

Gus: Way to early to call this a loosing move. It's still a game for sure.]

;W[km]C[Gus:overplay]
(;B[in]C[Gus:timid];W[dj];B[hj]C[Gus: you can't catch the two or three stones easily, but this might be ok since it helps your weak group.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr]C[Gus: BAD mistake by White. This should cause white to end in gote. W can sort of get away with this if W wants to crawl low in many situations, but your j6 stone is a big help here.]
(;B[hg];W[cj];B[mo]C[Gus: here you go adding a stone. The whole point of o7 is that it's ok for w to cut because you want to atari. Now you had to play 4 an extra stone.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[dm]C[ouch!!!
