C[I don't know where i lost this match exactly. I do`nt like great moyo`s, they are very hard to defend and when my oponent successfuly invade it, the match is ready for resign.
Even though this is the match scenario. But what kind of another result from this opening?]

C[this is a determined way of playing. You declare you are going for a moyo strategy and willing to give B 4th-line territory. But it seems too soon in the game for that. A moyo strategy does not mean simply making large walls very far apart and expecting the space between to become territory. rather, you threat the opponent with making a large territory, and when he tries to prevent it, you attack and seize the initiative. with thickness or whatever you get from attacking (don't expect to kill except in rare cases, and don't normally stake the game on killing) you enhance your other positions. at this stage there is little on the board, so you must be confident to play this way. In any case, don't give too much hard territory in exchange for thickness. All said, this is playable.]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[cc]LB[ci:a]C[this is wrong. B cuts easily. better to leave this area unplayed.
 If B C16, you descend happily at B15. C11 looks a good move, preventing 2-space extension from B. C11 seems a little low considering the walls on both sides, but I don't know a better move.]
;B[dd];W[de];B[cd];W[bd]C[The B16-B17 exchange is useless if you don't connect later at B15, B still plays B15 in sente.]
;B[bc];W[if]C[this is way too much. B can get a base at the bottom, and as long as he does not take his sente move at B15, he has B14 sente to help settle himself. once he is settled, you got nothing from your wall - moreover, the wall has no base.]
;B[be]LB[ek:a][dk:b][dj:c]C[This move means B gives up trying to live in your moyo, as it weakens C13. I would expect B to play around E9 to reduce after the exchange here.]
;W[bf];B[ad];W[cf];B[jd]C[I guess this is playable too, B goes his own way, showing no fear from the moyo. Dangerous though. Safer for B to first play D9 and see how W react. If W attacks from above, b lives inside using B14 kikashi. if W defends from below at C9, then B plays B15, then D11 to erase lightly.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[ho];B[pj]C[I have not time for moves like D10 now, they are too many big points on desk!
True. after you have B14 in place, don't play D10. if B invades now he will be heavily attacked. B should just reduce here, not invade.]
;W[nc]C[Looks the best point now. But I would still prefer B's position here, a little.
Remember in yose, when B playes A14, you must play B13.];B[lc]
;W[pf]C[not bad. But considering you intend to sacrifice O17, better to play R14 here, see later.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[qc];B[oc];W[qd]C[now R12 is a vulnerable point for W, which is why R14 was better.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[ph];W[ql]C[good. O15 kikashi first though.];B[of]
C[this semi-connection secures B for now.];W[nq]C[This postion look`s good for white, but that`s all?

Actually now would be a good time for something around D10-G9. the bottom is worth little because of G3-H5 stones, no side can get much territory at the nottom. If you want to secure the corner, P3 is better. in a large-knight shimari, there is more room to invade.]
;B[ck]C[This is the story. When black invade with success, it is time for resign. It is so hard defend great moyos. What is a moral? Never build moyos?

As I said in the beginning... In case you are wondering, I have not looked ahead before writing my comments except in the upper-right corner. This can be applied to all subjects of the game, not just moyos : know what you want from your positions. This way, if it fails, you learn for next time. A position can give you all sorts of things : secure territory, thickness, ko threats, base for reducing enemy territory... secure territory is simple, but all other positions are flexible. They don't give you one thing but several options, depending on how your opponent plays. For example, the lower-right corner is not territory yet, B can invade and live, or isolate the R8 stone. but if he does invade, you will get thickness. How to use that ? well, maybe to cut at P13 and attack the q12 group. and what do you get from this attack ? (remember don't usually expect to kill) maybe you can pressure Q12 from the direction of L11 and close teriitory on the left. In the end, it all comes down to territory, only there are many ways to get there. If you have a position the enemy can invade and the thickness you get is useless, defend it at first opportunity.
Another thing : in this game B has no real weaknesses, which is bad for you. even if you let him get territory, try to leave aji behind (places you can lean against him, kikashi etc.)]
;W[dl]C[good, this does not make it easy for B. He should still have trouble to live, but I guess he can.]
;B[dk]C[B13 first. when trying to live in a narrow place, kikashi first.]
;W[ek];B[bg];W[af];B[bl];W[el]C[ much too easy-going. B7, then e10.]
;B[bn]C[too greedy, B should B10 for easy life.];W[an];B[am]
;W[ao];B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh];B[ej]C[Rest of game is uninteressting. I think it was time for resign. Tell me please, how deal with this kind of games?

As I said before. Know what you want from your stones, and if you don't get it, see where you were wrong and modify your estimate for next game. Play flexibly but not vaguely. Also, know your strength and weakness as a player. if you are good at attacking and whole-board view, moyos are good for you. If you are strong at endgame, play solidly and try to reach endgame with no more than 20 pts behind, etc. You can also play on purpose styles you are weak at, to learn. If you can be better next week than this one, or even next month, you are doing great :) Best wishes,
