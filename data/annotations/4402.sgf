C[Pre-reviewed by Luiz Borges (White Player)

K:  Hi, Luiz.  I'm Kevin; I'll be reviewing this game.  I'll preface my comments with "K".]
;B[dj];W[jd];B[jj];W[dd];B[cf];W[jh]C[K:  This is a fairly solid opening sequence, though this move runs the risk of being split by K8.  (Black is not completely free from a similar threat at C6.)]
;B[gi];W[gd];B[eg]C[K:  Moves 7-9, while they appeal as solidifying your territories, are awfully slow and do nothing to threaten your opponent.  A more immediate attempt to invade might be more profitable, or at least more interesting.]
;W[be]C[K:  A timid move at this point in the game.  While it isn't mistaken in its theory (if White doesn't take the points, Black will) it ought to be left until a later stage.  Right now, Black has a huge open area along the bottom of the board that's ripe for invasion.]
;B[if];W[hh];B[ih]C[K:  Though this move isn't terrible, a play like G7 or L9 might have better; both aim at keeping White from connecting.  (Think about this: even if White got J6, he would still have a string of three stones with no base, and if you keep him from reaching his other stones, that could translate into no life.)]
;W[ig];B[ii];W[hg];B[jg];W[jf];B[kh];W[kg];B[ji];W[jg];B[gh]
C[K:  Though this move is useful, there are more important things to be done at this stage of the game.  (Think of invading White's territory, or perhaps making a move to defend your own.)]
;W[ie]C[K:  The J8 stone was already dead, and had it tried to escape it could easily have been stopped.  In short, this move is not necessary.]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[gg];W[gf];B[ce];W[ef];B[de];W[ed]C[K:  I would say that if you're going to make this sort of move, C10 is even more important--if Black takes that point, the White stone at B9 can easily be cut off and Black can take a lot of territory on the left side.  If he takes E10, on the other hand, White can respond with E11.  (Still dangerous, but there are more options.)]
;B[fe]C[K:  This move doesn't develop much of anything.  (Think how little profit White gets if he takes this space--what are you depriving him of by taking it?)]
;W[ge]C[K:  Again, this move, while not entirely useless, is too slow for the situation at hand.]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[cd];W[cc];B[ec]C[K:  Not a great move at this point.  Of course, White's reaction is to be expected, and while the whole situation is not without threat potential (which Black exploits here), there are more important things to do and this move is probably best made at some other time or saved as a ko threat.]
;W[dc];B[gc];W[fb];B[eb]C[That was sure a mistake by black.

K:  Indeed.  Though it's worth remembering that situations like this produce "aji", i.e. even though the stones are dead, their influence may still come into play later in the game.]
;W[ea];B[db];W[cb];B[bd]C[K:  Here is the threat I mentioned earlier, though with White's influence in the upper-left, Black's potential profit is greatly reduced.  (Now it is best approached as a way to secure the remaining space on the left side which Black was already exerting influence over.)]
;W[bc];B[bf]C[K:  Though I understand the desire to prevent White from connecting at A10, I still feel this is a heavy move.  I might recommend something like B7 or C6 to help solidify Black's control over the side and lower-left corner, which are still quite open.]
;W[hc]C[K:  Not necessary.  If Black extends with H11, White can easily control him (e.g. with H10), and if he plays to threaten at G12, White simply captures at D13.]
;B[dg]C[K:  Again, useful, but not the *most* useful move you could make with this stone.]
;W[ki];B[lh]
(;W[lj]C[K:  This is an interesting move.  Another possibility is to play M5 instead (see variation).]
;B[kj];W[li];B[lk];W[lg];B[kk]C[K:  Since this is not really a viable cut for White at this point, this move isn't really necessary right now.]
;W[hj];B[hi];W[gl]C[K:  You've got the right idea trying to invade Black's still-open bottom territory, but I would have suggested doing it somewhere a little more open, such as on the left hand side.]
;B[hk];W[gk];B[gj];W[ik];B[ij]C[K:  This could be played at H2 instead, which prevents White from being able to immediately threaten the Black stones and keeps him that much more separated.]
;W[hl];B[il];W[hj];B[jk];W[hk];B[fk];W[jl];B[kl];W[im];B[gm]
;W[fl];B[el];W[fm];B[jm]C[Another sure mistake.

K:  Yes--right now Black has a very vulnerable cutting point at E3, and as we see, White gets his two eyes regardless of how Black plays this position.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[jm];B[ek];W[em]
(;B[fg]C[K:  Bad choice.  It's easy to block if White plays F7 (respond F6), but the White stones poking at the bottom of the board are much more dangerous.  Also, since simply playing D1 would lead to a White cut at D2, see the variation for how to deal with this sort of set-up.]
;W[dl]C[K:  White correctly takes advantage of Black's error.]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[dk];W[dm];B[cj]C[Another mistake, here Black should have played B3 to make a ladder right?

K:  That's correct.];W[bk];B[gb];W[da];B[bj];W[al];B[aj]C[Here black should have attacked the vital point B1

K:  It's not really a vital point, because ultimately Black can't stop the white group in the corner from connecting to the rest of White's stones on the lower side, which do have two eyes.  I would say that Black's move here is acceptable.]
;W[bm]C[K:  As I said in the last comment, this group can't be destroyed; hence this move is not necessary for White.]
;B[ak];W[bl];B[ae]C[Here black should have played on A10 right away to claim more territory.

K:  Yes, or even A11 (with the subsequent sequence wA12, bA10), which would have also nipped a point from White.  Since he ends up in gote (defense) with any of these three moves, he might as well make the move that will gain him the most points.]
;W[ac];B[mj];W[mh];B[mi]C[Another mistake.

K:  Yes, probably one of those frustrating moments when you simply "mis-think."]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[mj];B[hb];W[ib];B[ic];W[hd];B[jc];W[jb]C[Should I play 116 here or at L11 to block a further expansion?

K:  The question in any defense usually boils down to "how can I keep my opponent from making life?"  In this case, you're doing a pretty good job of keeping Black's groups separate as-is, and the triangle group is in imminent danger of capture.  Black can stretch again (L11) if he wants, but if you keep him from making any useful shapes, it won't do him any good.  (Short answer:  This move is fine.)]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[kb];W[id];B[lc];W[ha];B[jc];W[ga]C[I guess that 124 should have been played on J11 or maybe M9 to restrict space.

K:  J11 is unncecessary--if Black plays there as-is, he'll simply be captured; if he reinforces at L11 and then plays J11, what good will it do him?

M9 would have been a good place to play, as it disrupts Black's potential eye shape.]
;B[ld]C[K:  This should have been played at M9 in a bid for eye space.  When you're invading a small space is no time to be slow, timid, or conservative.]
;W[ka];B[la];W[ic]C[I guess this force move on black wasn't need...

K:  No.  It would have been better spent making sure Black can't form eyes--perhaps N12.]
;B[kc];W[ja]C[K:  This is not necessary, because if Black captures the L13 stone White simply plays J13.  Black will eventually have to fill (or be captured back) and no benefit will come to him, except perhaps a delaying tactic.  Again, this move should have been used to make sure the Black group was confined and ruined.]
;B[mb]C[K:  Black finally takes the vital point.];W[le];B[me]
;W[mf];B[md];W[ke];B[lf]C[Another mistake.

K:  Pretty much, although because you're forced to capture the stone (and thus take up a point of your own territory), or otherwise fill some point, the net score stays the same.]
;W[mg];B[ad];W[df];B[tt];W[tt]C[White: 53.5 = 28 (Territory) + 20 (Black's Dead) + 5.5 (Komi)
Black: 27 = 24 (Territory) + 3 (White's Dead)
Result: W + 26.5

K:  I think the next step to major improvement for both of you will be as you learn to see which points on the board are really important and which ones are not.  There are parts of this game where a huge point goes unplayed for many moves while both players take inconsequential or drastically less-important points instead.  There are other times (such as White invasion from the bottom of the board into Black's left-hand territory) when an incorrectly-prioritized move costs one of the players dearly.

On the whole, though, the game shows that you both know what you're doing and have the potential to improve greatly.  I wish good luck to you both.]

(;B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[bl];W[dl];B[dk]C[K:  Obviously Black's territory suffers for allowing this sort of incursion, but this is about the best damage control he can do under the circumstances.  A cut at C3 is not an immediate danger (i.e., don't bother filling the point), but if White does play there Black will be forced to respond.]
))
(;W[li];B[lg];W[lf]C[K:  From here White can capture the three Black stones no matter how Black plays next.]
