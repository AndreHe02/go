C[Laniol [6k\]: Hi, enjoy
LazyBee [6k\]: hello
Laniol [6k\]: Hi to the reviewer =) Basically I have two main questions:
Laniol [6k\]: 1. Was my play up to move 65 okay (taking corners, invading bottom)? Was the game still winable then?
Laniol [6k\]: If not, how could I play differently?
Laniol [6k\]: 2. If yes, how should I have reduced or invaded the W moyo to have a chance?

It's not bad. You have all four corners, and you have sente.
But now it's urgent for you to play around A to negate white's influence.]

[nj][oj][ok]C[Laniol [6k\]: can B win from this position at all?

White center is certainly massive and intimidating. But you have lots of solid cash. 

I think it's possible for B to win by reducing instead of trying to dive in and live inside as you tried. 


A and B are kind of white's border posts. Placing a stone anywhere in between those posts should be possible for B. It shouldn't be too difficult to escape from there. Anywhere beyond that, and you will be forced to live inside.]

Look to reduce instead of jumping in and trying to live inside. 

Your opening was pretty good. Taking the corners is a great strategy as long as you're able to reduce white's center. With the ammount of cash you had, a more conservative approach would have won you this game. 

What also would have helped you in your attempt to live in the center is better reading skill. 
You missed the ko chance, and you misread a ladder. Those things really hurt you.
Studying Life and Death and Professional Games will certainly help you get better at the close combat necessary to live inside your opponents territory successfully. 
But again, in this game just counting and realizing that a reduction of the center would be enough would have been sufficient. 

good luck!
