C[neji: Dear reviewer, I think I've played a lot of questionable moves in the fuseki and middlegame and I don't know if they were good or not (I made comments where I'm confused) Hope you'll help me figure that out. If you can find other mistakes - please tell me. Any suggestions on how to improve would be great too :)

I did not think you made too many questionable moves. In the opening you made 2 mistakes, 9 and 25. These 2 moves influenced the rest of the game.
 
I think you should pay attention to the following: 
- You tend to play the large moves on the board and omit the urgent ones. Play the urgent moves. 
- You also want to kill groups of your opponent even when there is no real oppertunity to do so. Better is to chase the your opponents group(s). By doing so you will get a chance to strengthen your weak group(s) and make territory.
- during the game also count your own and your opponents territory, because when knowing the score it will help to determine how agressive to play or how deep to invade into your opponents territory.]

(;B[nc]C[neji: I think this is sente against k17 stone, but I don't know if i should defend d15 after (W)g17  or not.

* White cannot afford not to answer, problem is that after (W)G17,  (B)D15 you do not have a good move to attack the white group.

A better option is to play at H17. The left side of the board is the side you want to make territory.]
;W[gc];B[qj]LB[de:A][ci:B][ck:C]C[* A move at A (D15) is better. It seals off the corner and helps stone at B(C11) when white plays C(C9). 

A move at A also secures your corner and gives you at least 20 points here. The move at R10 does not secure 20 points.]
;W[ck]C[neji: how should i play now? I don't like c14, because the shimari is too loose and I like building solid positions.

* This is a good move from white.]
(;B[cf]LB[de:A][qj:D][ck:B][en:C]C[* I think it is the best option, first defend the corner and see how white reacts, he must do something now with C9.
But is is also why you should have defended at A(D15). 
Because after B(C9) you can then play C(E6).

White will not play this but in stead play somewhere around D(R10).]
;W[ek];B[en];W[ei]C[neji: where should I play now? maybe simply run at g6?

* Problem of playing at G6 is that white will play B12, and white will live with the 3 stones and black has a floating group.]

(;B[bp];W[cq];B[bl];W[bk];B[di]C[neji: was d11 necessary? and if c11 needed help was d11 the right move to do that?

* D11 is necessary (see previous moves). Personally I would not have played B8 yet, Also because at a later stage you might want to play at C8 instead.]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[bq]
(;B[qn]C[neji: I wonder if this is the move where I lost the game, because I gave W sente to attack e6?

* It is not the game-losing move. But is is move is not urgent.
The left/side of the board is urgent. There is a weak black and white group on the left side of the board. 
Attack the white group and you will get a change to reinforce your black group.]

(;W[qq]LB[om:A]C[* Should be at A.];B[pl]LB[on:A]C[* This is not a good move When you want to prevent an invasion play A. This expands black's moyo and limits whites chance to broaden his moyo.]

;W[gi];B[ih]C[neji: this looks like a mistake to me.

* Why is this a mistake ? 
This move still puts some pressure on the white group. Downside is that white can cut this stone.]

(;W[gg]
(;B[gd]LB[ge:A]C[neji: I tried to make leaning attack but it didn't work.

* I tried some alternative moves (like A(G15). But none of these work well. 
Since it is not possible to cut white let the groups link. but get something in return.]

(;W[km];B[iq];W[bo]LB[db:A]C[neji: now the game is hopeless for me.

* Did you count the score ?
If you are able to play A(D18) first the score is:
White:
Top: 5 points
Centre: 83 points
Total 90 points
Black: 
Left: 26 points
Top: 36 points
Right: 12 points
Total: 74 points 
So you are 16 points behind, unless you are able to make 16 points at the bottom.

This is when white can play A(D18) first.
