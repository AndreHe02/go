C[This is cime. First of all, thank you for letting me review this game. As there were no comments by the player, any comment in here is from me. I hope it helps you a bit.

i will finish the review here because there are only some endgame moves left.

1. It was pretty difficult to make this review for you as you didn't go through the game and comment on it yourself beforehand. But that is actually the first step for improving. And Go is a fight of plans and ideas. So if I don't know what you think, I can't say whether the move you played was "good" or "bad". It all depends on what you want to achieve.
2. Take your time and think more deeply about your moves and find reasons for them. A lot of your moves seemed like "oh, I need/want to play there." and then you jsut played somewhere in the area, but you didn't reason each possibility and then decided on which will lead to the best result (in you understanding). But this is a big part of the game of go.
3. Try to read more ahead. This was a game on the dragongoserver, so you had all the time you needed. Moves like B15 shouldn't be the result, if you would have read properly.
4. Think about points. You played a few time moves, that didn't make points, especially in the endgame (e.g. M1).
5. Basics. All the things I mentioned above are actually the Basics of Go. For now, you don't need fancy knowledge to improve, but just a base understanding and level of ability. Afterwards, you can actually try to concentrate on fancy openings, josekis etc.

For now, I think these are the major things. If you try to concentrate on these, you should be able to improve by a lot.]
