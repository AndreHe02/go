C[Hi.  I played this game the other day on KGS as Black.  It was pretty close except for a misclick.  I am just looking for any tips that can help me play better.  I had a few specific questions that I have included, too.  Thanks for your help!

**** I'm David and I'm a 1 dan on KGS.  All of my comments will be preceeded by *****]
;B[pd]C[MatCauthon [8k\]: hi];W[dd]C[goldeneye [7k\]: hello]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[pj];W[co]C[***** though there are different opinions on this, I think this move is too slow when played against B's opening.]
;B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]C[***** I think this is the wrong move in this situation.  With Q14, you could make a beautiful moyo that works well with K4 if you supress W by playing at P17.]
;W[kc]LB[md:A]C[*** this is a mistake.  it would be better for W to play at K16.  the third line is too low for w, espeically since all of your stones are exerting center influence.  Now, a play at A becomes devastating for W's chances in the game.   See the variation.]

(;B[jj]C[***** see the previous variation to see if you think N16 is a better play than K10.]
;W[dj];B[me]C[Is this a good move at this stage?

**** no, as I said, the middle game joseki starting with N16 is preferable.]
;W[nq]C[It seems I handled this badly.  What should I have done?


***** before reviewing the sequence that you did play, I think I would prefer the normal attachment joseki at P3.  Q3 is also a very harsh option.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[oq]
(;B[jd]C[I guess this should have been at S4?

***** not necessarily.  If B S4, then W can M3.  So, S4 is not necessarily sente.  Furthermore, I have a tendency to support playing at F17 instead of K16.  See the variation.]
;W[rn];B[rp];W[rj];B[ri]C[**** this is too defensive.  You HAVE to split at S8.  espeically with the wall at S4.]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pn];B[ol];W[rk];B[on];W[pl]
(;B[om]C[***** here you went wrong.  This should have been at Q7.  maybe you could have killed.  See the variation.]
;W[pm];B[jc];W[jm];B[gp]C[****** I would force first at N3.]
;W[gm];B[fc];W[lq];B[lp];W[mp];B[mo];W[mq];B[lo];W[fd];B[gd]
C[***** I think this would be the wrong joseki to play here.  It ends up being overconcentrated because of the K17 stones.  Better to jump into the corner with C17.]
;W[fe]
(;B[ec]C[***** again, you should be playing further into the corner.  Perhaps the joseki of D17.  See variation.]
;W[dc]
(;B[kd]C[It seems to me that I could have mounted a more effective attack on this group.


*****yes, this is too weak and simply lets W settle his group.  W should be thanking you.  A more effective attack with the K17 stone in place would be to play at N18.  See the variation.  W can only get 1 eye.]
;W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[rc];W[pc];B[pe]
C[****** this is too weak.  You should extend upward at P16.]
;W[jh];B[lj]C[****** again, too weak.  With the wall at P8, don't worry about this stone.  I would start by leaning at G15 and then try to cut the K12 stone off.]
;W[ij];B[ge];W[ff];B[ik];W[jk];B[hk]C[***** I think instead, I would go for the larger side and play at J11.]
;W[jl]C[***** the reason I would J11 instead of H9 is because W should play at K11 before connecting.]

;W[si];B[rh];W[fo]C[**** if I were you, I would invade at C10 now.]
;B[kq];W[gr]
(;B[hn]C[***** Mistake.  I think you can kill the R3 group now.  L3 was a forcing move.   See variation.]

;W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[ll]C[MatCauthon [8k\]: boy, I'm just not thinking straight today :)

***** you are behind at this point.  I think you have to try C10.  You are letting W off too easily.  Especially since you have E12 to aim at.]

****** please note something.  Look at the two moyos that each side create.  W invaded 3 times into the B moyo.  however, B does not have a single invasion in the W moyo.  This is why B lost the game.  I hope these comments were helpful.]
