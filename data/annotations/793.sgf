AB[pd][dp]C[Comments by Didier Kropp,

dk 8k* on Igs.



General comments : Black is too much thinking of making territory in defending very conservatively. This can work in a 9-stones handicap game, not in a merely even game.

Territory is often made by attacking.];W[dd];B[pp];W[qn];B[np]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[oo];B[op]C[This exchange is good for Black.]
;W[oe];B[od]C[Good for Black.];W[pe];B[ne]C[Good.];W[qc]LB[pc:a]

;W[pj];B[nj]LB[jp:a][jd:b]C[Why not ?

This is an erasing move.

But a or b are very good points : perfect extension from hoshi and the 4-18 or 6-12 stones.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[dk];B[en]LB[fc:a][jd:b]C[Good idea.

Approaching at a seems also good.

Playing at b also.];W[fc];B[cc]LB[nm:a][jc:b][cg:c][be:d][cd:e]
C[??

Jealous :-)



All you can expect is living with a ko if White knows well the joseki :-), which is too early in the game.



a, starting to make a big moyo, is good and in line with your move at 28.



b is more conservative, but makes territory.



Or if you want to play on the left side, you can play c. You have space on each side to extend.



A good move is also d, but they are nasty variations...



You can also play e.



Remember : even if you make life, it will be *very* small (5 points max), in gote, *and* White will make an outside wall by playing at e. This strength will be *much* more than the 5 points you can  make.]
;W[cd]LB[dh:a][ic:b][lb:c][lc:d]C[Imagine you make a small life.

Remember : it is near *always* in gote.



Just think about a White move at a. Is'n it much more than the 5 points you can expect ?     Or a White move at b, threatening to play at c. If you answer at d, White will play at a, making a large-scale moyo...]
;B[bc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[bb]C[Unorthodox moves...

;B[ac];W[ab]LB[ce:a]C[Dead :-(



And White has made a wall and is *very* strong.

But even if you had lived (in gote), White would heve made the same strength in sente...



Var 2 : Black plays a]
(;B[fl]LB[jc:a][je:b][ic:c][kc:d][pk:e][ol:f][oh:g][pi:h][jp:i]
[ch:j][ce:k]C[As the dust as settled in the upper left corner, have a look.



In the upper side, you both are strong on each side : that means you and your opponent can not make a lot of territory. You can both play at a, aiming at b, or be conservative and play at c (white) or d (black). But that's not very big.



In the right side, your stone at 24 guarantee not so much territory for White  : if he plays f, you play h, if he plays g, you play e.

No emergency.



In the bottom side, Black playing at i makes a good framework, but White can still invade, and the bottom left corner is still open at the 3-3 point.



In the right side, if White plays j, he will builds *real* territory. So the point seems here.

And... White has a weakness at k. You can cut here (the ladder does not work), aiming at rescuing your dead stones, and destroying white hopes for territory.

So I think this is the point.     With the move played, you start building a *big* moyo.

White will invade, you will have to be agressive.];W[hq];B[gq]
;W[hp];B[gp]LB[kp:a][gr:b]C[??



Too defensive.



You should play a, attacking the white stones.



Locally, this is a *bad* move, making *bad* shape. Better play b.]
;W[lq]LB[jq:a][jp:b]C[White starts making a base.];B[mq]C[In Go, territory is made often by attacking.   This is purely defensive.
