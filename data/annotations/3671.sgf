C[Hi, it's my first time requesting a review. Here I played as black side. I've added some questions, please answer them all and some comments for my good or bad move would be very helping though. If you don't mind, it would be great to have some variation for the explanation. Thank you very much for the review.

Best regards,

Jyuushi

Hi Jyuushi,
my comments will be marked with <tomjk> which is my username on KGS and IGS.
I hope my comments will be useful to you.];B[pc]C[jyuushi [13k?\]: hi

(;B[dd]C[Q#1 : Is this move all right? My idea was I didn't want white to have too thick wall, as there is a stone in D4. But white did get a thick wall there though.

<tomjk> White has played first in this corner and therefore you should not expect to get too much at the moment here. It is ok to grant white a wall .. as exchange black gets a wall on it's own.

Your move is not so good, as with the next move white can put your stone in atari and you must respond to avoid being captured.
Please see the variation for a possible "normal" continuation.]
;W[de];B[dc];W[fd];B[cc]C[<tomjk> white gets a nice wall and black is small in the corner. It is important to be not closed into the corner in the beginning of the game.

Try to think of your stones and groups as parts of a team which must throughout the game work together. The more teammembers can reach each other, the more power you have.]
;W[ce]
(;B[cn]LB[ch:B][ck:C][dk:A]C[<tomjk> this is not so good. White now gets to pincer your stone with a move around "A" which is also a good extension from the wall above. Better play here at "C" yourself. This way you can either extend to your actual move or to "B" if White responds locally.
See also variations.];W[ck]LB[dk:A]C[<tomjk> "A" works better with the upper wall and is more oriented into the center.]

(;B[cq]LB[ci:B][di:C][en:A]C[<tomjk> I would have considered also "A", with in mind to later invade at "B" or reduce at "C" if white does not defend its left side after "A" is in place..
Your move is ok too I guess.]
(;W[dq]C[<tomjk> wrong side from White. should keep the black stones separated. See also variation.]
;B[cp]C[<tomjk> good.]
(;W[dh]TR[dq]C[<tomjk> too slack. White shows that he is afraid of an invasion. White should first continue in the lower left corner and try to seal black in. However the result is anyway not good for white, because the marked white stone was played from the wrong side.
See variation ...];B[en]C[<tomjk> very good!];W[hq]LB[oq:A]
C[<tomjk> this is a good result. White has low positions on the left side and also on the bottom. Black should now make a shimari at "A" for example.]
;B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[Q#2 : What about this move?

<tomjk> too early right now. There is no urgency playing this move as white is quite safe here. Though white will likely respond, so you don't loose sente.
However this way you force White to play at "A", which you maybe wanted to play yourself later... so you move settles a position which is better left open for the meanwhile, as it has potential to be used in the different way later on.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[ep];B[gq];W[er];B[gp];W[gr]LB[gn:A][hp:B]C[<tomjk> this accomplished nothing. White gets a rock solid position, captures a stone and Black ends up with three stones which have only three liberties ... Black need connect them with "A" now or push with "B".]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[lq]LB[nq:B][oq:A]C[<tomjk> sufficient to play at "A". Black gained already enough on the lower side by pressing the white stones. The played black stone is weak against the white formation on the left side. Consider White playing at "B" and you see yourself.]
;W[qe]C[<tomjk> good.];B[od]C[<tomjk> the famous shusaku move :)]
;W[qh]
(;B[pf]C[<tomjk> Since there is no black stone at "A", Black should play at "B" to give White a cramped position and then extend on the top.
See variation.];W[qf];B[kc]LB[jd:B][oh:A]C[<tomjk> the idea is good, but not efficient. Black would like to play at "A". to deny White access to the center. But as you always noted, Black has no stone around "B" and can't therefore not finish off the exchange equally with White.]
;W[ic]LB[oh:A][oq:B]C[<tomjk> no need to play here now. "A" or "B" are better.]
;B[je]C[<tomjk> ok, but the trade-off is to get a small corner for Black.]
;W[fc]C[<tomjk> good.];B[bc];W[bd];B[fb];W[gb];B[ea];W[ga];B[ca]
;W[jd];B[kd];W[ie];B[jf];W[if];B[ig]C[Q#3 : Actually I was afraid of a cut at K13, but I realized 'bout it after I placed the stone. Is this ok?

<tomjk> this is ok. It is important to push White back, or else he will get too much territory here.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qk]C[<tomjk> good.];B[qm]LB[nq:B][oq:A]TR[lq]
C[<tomjk> that is about the best Black can do here. Now Black would be happy to have the marked stone at "A" or "B" to secure off a big corner.]
;W[qc]C[<tomjk> the lower right corner seems more important now.]
;B[qd]LB[pb:A][qb:B]C[<tomjk> it is about the third time you wedge into two white stones. This does not help Black. it just solidifies White.
If you want to play here, then defend at "A" or "B" instead.]

(;W[mh]LB[ng:A]TR[pe][of][pf][og]C[Q#4 : What will actually happen if w go o13 instead of n12 here? (I was quite afraid too...)

<tomjk> you are right to be afraid. White O3 ("A") would be better here, as Black is short of liberties (marked stones). See variation.]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[mi]
(;W[pj]LB[ng:A][ok:B]C[Q#5 : Should white move here? Or L12 is better one?

<tomjk> White should definitely first play "A" (O13) and then still has time to defend the left side. The actual move is too cautious. Also "B" is possible here.
See variation.];B[li];W[hg];B[ih];W[fh]C[Q#6 : I think white went too easy on me, didn't he?

<tomjk> yes definitely. See previous variation on how White could have split up your position on the upper side.]
;B[hh];W[gg];B[gj];W[nk]LB[jp:A][oq:B]TR[lq]C[<tomjk> maybe first "A", then attack the marked stone with "B". Later then this move.]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[pl]C[<tomjk> good for Black. White helps Black to build big territories.]
;W[nj]C[<tomjk> not a real threat anymore.];B[lk]C[<tomjk> very good.]
;W[ni];B[ng];W[ml];B[ll];W[fl];B[el]LB[gl:A]C[<tomjk> a little bit greedy now. Black is ahead in territory. is sufficient to block at "A" to win the game. Proverb: "if you are ahead don't start unnecessary fights."]
;W[ek]C[Q#7 : Is this right? I thought b would have hard time if w answered at F9.

<tomjk> yes, F9 looks better for White.];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[dl]
;B[em]LB[ej:A]C[<tomjk> White has efficiently helped Black to build a nice wall. Also leaves a double-atari threat at "A".]
;W[gi];B[hi]C[<tomjk> good.];W[ej];B[ko]LB[bl:A][rl:B]C[Q#8 : Since about 10-20 moves before I've been thinking to move here. When is actually the best time to do this?

<tomjk> yes. Perfect timing. Other equal big moves would be "A" or "B".]
;W[oq]C[<tomjk> too late for White. At best White can live with two eyes in gote, but most likely will die here.]

C[Q#9 : Actually from the beginning I'd let him to make 2 eyes there while I build some thickness in lower right and a chance of a monkey jump , but would it have been possible to kill white here? ( if I answer correctly since the first w invasion here)

<tomjk> yes you can kill White here. Instead of the black stone at "A" you could have played immediately "B".
However then you would not be able to get into the lower side so far. So to play "A" is a decision which results in a trade-off: "White lives and Black reduces the lower side". I don't know what is better. I show a variation starting at "A", which I would have played.]

<tomjk> it seems you could improve your endgame considerably. Try to find sente moves first, then play gote moves which would be sente for your opponent. Then only play sente moves.
As a rule of thumb: sente moves count double they points they make, gote moves count the points they make.]

<tomjk> there is no way that white would tenuki here and why should he play "A" if he has connected already at "B"?
Anyway, the white marked stones have too many liberties ... to danger here.]

Thank you very much for your review.

<tomjk> You play already quite well.
But since White did in this game avoid any fighting and gave away the game easily, I cannot say anything about your fighting abilities.
The two or three  things you could improve are:
1 - direction of play in the beginning. Try to have your stones work together and don't look only at the local situation.
2 - endgame. You have still to develop a judgement of "sente", "reverse sente" and "gote" moves. Try to read something on endgame or get some reviews especially on your endgame.
3 - score estimate: you should try to estimate now and then the score on the board. If you are ahead, you should not take risks. If you are behind, than you must take risks in order to turn the game around. Estimating the score is difficult in the beginning and middle game, as not only territory, but also walls (influence) and realive position of groups do influence the possible outcome.

Try to improve in the order 1 - 2 - 3 (counting being less important to master).

Take my comments with a grain of salt - also I am still learning :) I hope my comments are useful.

Good luck and many good games!

Best wishes.
