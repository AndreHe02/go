It is possible to attack white with R8 but this game
I will play not so aggressive

********

Generally pincers are avoided when your opponent has a stone in the other corner, like here so this is good.

However, S4 is not joseki. O3 and O4 are more common. I am not sure why this is so, but I believe its because the peep at R3 can become useful if white invades the bottom.]

No. In the opening it is a good idea to play away from thickness/other stones. K5 is not efficient at this point.

I believe that you are much stronger than the computer here. You should play against humans on KGS or IGS or Tygem. They will give you a better game.

Here is a general summary:

1) The opening was fairly even for both sides - while Black's shape was good at the bottom, white had large influence over the rest of the board, and perhaps was actually a little better off.
2) The first big fight was on the bottom right. If the players were even, white would have lived, but black would have benefited in other ways. As it was, white made many mistakes and black succeeded in killing white. This is generally game over.
3) White made a few endgame moves in the middle game. You should ignore these and occupy areas of the board with few stones, or, if possible attack weak enemy groups or strengthen weak friendly groups instead of answering these moves.
4) Black attacked white's small group on the right too early, but quickly moved to the top which was good. The poke at this point helped white.
5) White failed to attack black's group, and eventually black didn't need the help on the right.
6) Black should have helped the top group rather than let white push through.
7) Black should have cut at K10 to cut off the white group.

After this, white made a number of slow moves and failed to cut off the top black group. The game was over, but white played on, losing the bottom groups as well.

I hope this is helpful!!
