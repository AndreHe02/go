R> Probably not a good way to start a game :-)];W[pp]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: Hello]
;B[dd]C[artichoke [19k\]: hi
miai for sanrensai

R> Seems reasonable, though if you're feeling confident you can try experimenting with 3-4, and 3-3 - at 19k I remember playing lots of handicap games and concentrating on 4-4 - so it's also a good time to experiment with different openings]
;W[jp]C[R> A fairly reasonable move by W, but I'd prefer f3 B C or D6, and pull back to k3 - though that sequence ends on gote.]
;B[dj];W[pj]
(;B[cc]C[satisfied with my moyo's too early I thinkprolly shoulda played the other hoshi

R> This move only really protects the corner - if you have k16, then W wodul be silly to invade that corner - see variation]
;W[jd]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: my connection is slow for some reason
artichoke [19k\]: its ok
I do not know how to deal with this move...this is a big oppertunity for me to learn

R> You have strength on the left, and the W stone is lonley, Q16 is also looking pretty lonely

conventional play here is to attack W's stone whilst re-inforcing your weaknesses - so I'd say O17 or N17]
;B[lc]C[R> M17 is the right idea, but is a bit of a stretch from Q16]
;W[jj]C[R> W didn't punish M17 immediately, so I'd consider M15 which strengthens your position whilst weakening W's position]
;B[hc]TR[ee][qf][fq]C[R> This also works well

Let's take a break here and see where the big areas left are

To me the triangle marked places are where W can make the most gains ...

E15 helps to erase potential moyo
F3 and R14 both advance W's positio into currently neutral territory]
;W[jc]TR[qg][gq]C[R> OK W is splitting two strongish positions apart, so I'd advise R13, or G3 advancing into the neutral areas and starting to threaten W's moyo]
;B[qg]C[R> Yep that looks pretty good, and in my opinion better than G3 as it's helping to make the Q16 position stronger]
;W[le]C[R> This attacks M17,  you can defend at O16 or N16]
;B[qc];W[nd]C[R> See how your defended the wrong stone? - you need to make them work together, now W can enjoy attacking and gain some strength in the centre.]

(;B[nc]C[R> Also consider O18 - see variation];W[mc];B[mb];W[md]
;B[oc];W[od];B[qi];W[qj];B[hq];W[iq]
(;B[cq]C[R> Once again - you need to make your stones work together - H3 is looking pretty weak, and W has re-inforced his position- I'd defend at H4 this works better with D4

playing C3 just leaves H3 to fend for itself];W[hp];B[gq];W[gp]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[eo];W[hr];B[fq];W[fn]C[R> and W gets more out of this position -

now is a good time to play R3  the kind of move you've been defending against all this time - but only now is it becoming an important place to play]
;B[en];W[em];B[dm];W[el];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[ek]C[ick...even though I'm on the 4th line, his center moyo looks really dangerous already]

;B[fd];W[ge];B[gg]TR[nh][qq]C[R> The result of this whole sequence is that W gets an enormous centre, B needs to reduce this territory, R3 is a good place to start, and jumping inat O12 helps too]

R> In summary, 

Look at the board now, youy have four groups, and W has only one group - the less groups you have the less time you have to spend defending your groups and the more you can concentate on territory.

Here's a few points that I think will help improve your game: -

1) If you manage to create lots of sutting points in your opponent's walls, then make good use of them.
2) Don't be afraid of fighting kos, the worst that can happen is that you loose the ko, but learn a valuable lesson.
3) Consider some alternative moves - look at n1, s8 suggestions for some examples.
4) Moves have a time at which they become important, if they are played too early you you can loose the initiative and hence the opportunity to play bigger moves. (C3, C17, and R17 could have been played later) + the invaision at R3 could have been played earlier. Don't rush to defend, consider can you attack and then come back to defend?
5) Don't play -1 point gote moves, in particular S2, and W's K6
6) Enjoy your games :-)])
