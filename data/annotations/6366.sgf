AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[nq]C[Thanks for reviewing my game! (black)

* Hi. I hope my comments and variations will be useful.];B[qn]
C[Is low move an okay response?

* Yes.];W[pr];B[qq];W[fq]C[How should I punish white for ignoring finishing off his shape?

* It's important to separate the two groups. A move like C6 would be wrong.]
;B[lp]C[* This is OK.];W[no];B[mp];W[np];B[ln];W[lr];B[iq];W[dr]
;B[gr]LB[fp:A]C[This seemed a bit low, and I would eventually get cut.

* Yes, this isn't good. I think A is a good move here.];W[cq]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[bn]C[This move looks strange. C6 instead creates eye shape and can never be cut.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[kp];B[ko];W[jo]LB[io:A]C[The left group is in danger, so you should play A for example.]
;B[mn];W[io];B[fo]LB[hp:A]C[Sacrificing the group is not a good idea, because J5 becomes strong. Instead, you should escape at A.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[eq];W[er];B[nn];W[eo];B[fp];W[ep];B[en]

[ej:B]C[Not sure what a good response was. I decided to put pressure on his group while jumping out at the same time. Perhaps loose pincer would have been better.

* A pincer at A puts more pressure on his stone. If you want to jump out, a cap at B looks better.]
;W[bl];B[cl];W[ck];B[cg];W[di]
(;B[dj]LB[ch:A][ei:B]C[* This move is really bad. It threatens the cut at C11, but even if white could not play D9, he would defend the cut at A or B which would result in a very bad exchange.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[ej]C[* White is very strong now.];B[fk];W[cc]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb]
(;B[gb]TR[gc]C[This leaves a dangerous cut at G17, so it's better to extend.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf]C[Perhaps I finished off wrong side. Invites a cut.

* I agree.];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[ic];W[hb];B[ib]
;W[ga]
(;B[jd];W[ie]LB[kc:A]TR[jd]C[This exchange is not good, because it weakens your left group. Instead, you should just extend to A.]
;B[kc];W[nc]
(;B[kf]C[He invaded quite deeply, perhaps I should have capped him or something.

* This move doesn't really attack O17. It doesn't attack J15 either, because White has F16.]

* Yes, you would have won. The snapback is a really basic tesuji which is essential to know in order to become stronger.]

(;W[mo];B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl];W[ij];B[hn]C[I live! but from here on, his corners add up to be too much, since his right group lived and his corners were more or less stable territory.]
