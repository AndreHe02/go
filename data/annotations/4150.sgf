-------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thank you very much for taking a look at this game. i ussually take black in my game, and it was my habit to play first  move in tengen (oftenly first three move). but i found it`s hard to play it when i take white. so, i lack of  territory in this game

 I have added comments about my motivations and concerns during the game.  I am especially interested in your opinion of my reasoning at those points.  Again, thanks in advance for all of your comments!

 and please, make some comment to my yose part in this game too, i think i lost much in that part.]
;B[pd];W[jj]C[This move is particularly suited to a really rough style of play, that is, lots of life and death fighting; as the fights in the game progress, the player with tengen has an advantage because the fights will generally progress to the centre of the board.  

Should a game turn toward being very stable, large territory, the tengen stone ends up wasted.  

Even for black tengen is not very standard; for white it even less standard.]
;B[dp];W[dn]C[Tengen is not meant to make territory; it is an aid to heavy centre fighting.   Trying to form territory with it, especially this early, is premature.  Perhaps better to play a third line approach, and try for live on the side, or play for one of the corners.

i play fourth line to make some influence in center.
i found  a spectator says it was bad, wasn`t it?];B[fp];W[de]
;B[pq];W[po];B[oo]C[Up to here, your moves are not using the tengen stone appropriately.  Black is forming a large moyo on the lower side, and you are forming one on the left.  White, with tengen, wants more instability, more close fighting.  Moves like H3 to pressure the lower side there, or trying to execute a pincer on the Q16 stone, these would start some fights, and thus exploit your centre stone.]
;W[pn];B[pp]C[Beginer178 [11k?\]: d6 is not good];W[on];B[no]
C[H3 would be really nice here,  followed by N3 perhaps.  Both groups have open doors, that is, a 3rd line attack reduces, substantially, the territory connected with the group.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[dc]C[This is much too early to be playing to make an area yours.  You are making a moyo only; the whole area may become black's.  In point of fact, both D6 and O16 are in weak positions being so close to doubled up corner stones, so even calling the upper left white's moyo is strained.  K4 is looking like the most important place right now for black, so it is the most important place for you.

try to make upper side mine, after play O16];B[cd]C[Mistake for black; this can easily be turned to your advantage.]
;W[dd];B[ce]C[This]
(;W[cc]C[See variation.  this is not the way to gain from black's mistake.]
;B[cf];W[cj]C[You have tickness facing a friendly stone at O16, but you're pushing black into the area with C10; plus C10 is not really doign that much with D6 and K10, nor is it really hurting black; there is a lot of life for black even now.]
;B[bc]
(;W[pi]C[This again forces black's corner into the area between your thickness and O16; that area is your best at the moment, and you're helping black to ruin it.]
;B[lc];W[jc];B[le];W[nf];B[nb];W[nc];B[ob];W[mb]C[This is using the tengen; all the variations lead to a fight for life in thre centre.  

i like this sequence, it was good for me, wasn`t it?];B[mc]

Nakatomi [14k\]: no problem];W[dg];B[cg];W[ei];B[di];W[dj];B[jq]
C[This is one of those key moves that should have been played much earlier by the white player.  The weaknesses of both groups are nearly fixed with one move, and he gets a really nice moyo, one that he didn't need to trade territory for like white did.  White's moyo was "paid for" by black building a big corner and a left side area; black's moyo was "free".]

(;W[eh]C[Why fix this?  See variation.];B[ch]C[Why save two stones at this point?]
;W[cp]C[C5 might have been better; would leave you with sente to make a big move like P13 or F6]
;B[cq];W[co];B[en]C[F6 is now lost];W[dm];B[bq];W[eo]C[P13 is the bigger threat.  The area on the lower left is more stable for you, so no need to over play it right now.

i was worried that he will destroying my center, so i want to cut it.]
;B[ep];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[hn];W[gm]C[Black doesn't need]
(;B[ho]C[I would play H7 since it is good shape, and N7 is a loose play near black strength.

i am confused answering his move.

 my first thinking was in H7, but i think he will play N7 after that , so he have big low side and chance to attack my P6 group while taking my center.

your comment?];W[mm]C[so i play N7 first];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl]
;W[hj];B[oh]C[N7 doesn't count for much now];W[qg];B[pg]C[Yunaleska [13k\]: very slow connection here... :(

[ms][ns][ps][ss]C[The style of game you adopted essentially flew in the face of the tengens basic use.  If you play it you want to play all out; pincer approaches, undercuts, make the game a fighting game, and the tengen stone has a chance to shine.  Your style seems to be one of big territory.  Play more basic joseki, and learn about thickness and good shape; these are you main tools in a large territory game.  Much was lost due to diffuse manner in which you played the centre, and H7 in particular could have shifted the balance into your favour greatly I think.]
