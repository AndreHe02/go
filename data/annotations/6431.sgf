C[Dear reviewer,

I had white in this game on KGS and won by resignation. However, I would like to improve a few points where I feel I could have done better in this game.

- attacking more severely;
- making better shape.

Hopefully using this game will alllow you to give me a few hints on attacking and making shape. I have put some comments in the game to let you know what I was thinking.

Thank you,
Philippe


Hello, it is your reviewer Dmitrii Shevchenko, Shedal (1 dan) on KGS.

I reviewed either for white and black so you could learn from your opponent's mistakes.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me at KGS or by Email.]

;B[jd]LB[pc:A]C[Shedal: after this B move, you should think about the right moment for invasion in the TR corner. I think, the best point is at [A\]. See variation to the next move.]

(;W[jp];B[df]C[Shedal: Strange move by B.

This move is usually bad unless there is some potentlal for B moyo on the left, which is not the case here.]

(;W[cf]TR[jd]C[Shedal: this move is not joseki, although it seems appropriate here due to presence of the marked stone. See var.]
;B[cg];W[ce];B[dg];W[fc]LB[fd:A][hc:B][gc:C]C[Shedal: [A\] would be more common. If you don't like forcing B moves like [B\], you could move at [B\] or [C\] yourself. The move in the game is too close to other stones in the corner.]
;B[dk];W[cm]C[P: Not sure this was the best move, but I wanted to limit black's development while starting to build some territory.

Shedal: this move is OK];B[iq]C[Shedal: another strange move by B.]
;W[jq]C[Shedal: right.]
(;B[ip]C[Shedal: pros always seem to play as in variation - this is more light and powerful technique]
;W[io];B[gp];W[eq];B[ho];W[in]
(;B[fn]
(;W[ir]LB[hr:A][pc:B]C[Shedal: this move ends in gote if B plays at [A\]. B don't even need to answer it, he could just connect with his left group. That is, the direction is wrong.
You won't mind if your opponent makes eyes in gote, so you should put pressure on the weak group while making sure territory, then take sente to get a big point (B, for example).

See variation.]
(;B[hq];W[np]LB[em:A]C[P: I hesitated before playing this move, but I felt I had to extend while trying to seal the black group in the corner.

Shedal: a move around [A\] is still urgent to separate 2 black groups and possibly continue the attack.]
;B[op];W[no];B[pl]C[P: this seems like a mistake from black.

Shedal: this move itself is not a mistake since it could be treated as kikashi if leaved as it is. Although the standard kikashi is one line higher.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[pj];B[nl]C[P: black has a weak group

Shedal: now B is running out which is somewhat pointless. He didn't achieve any useful result but helped W instead. The 2 B stones were light and could be sacrificed easily.]

(;W[mm]C[P: Attacking while making profit?

Shedal: I think the direction is wrong again ;-)
The profit isn't any big. You can attack on a larger scale. See var.]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[qk]C[Shedal: a bad move. Never push through if you cannot cut. This only reduces your own liberties.]
;W[rk];B[ll];W[kl];B[lj];W[ni];B[mj];W[nh];B[og];W[qc]LB[pc:A]

[bk:B][jb:A]C[P: I could not make this work

Shedal: if you want to reduce you could [A\].
This was also a good moment to stop and count the score.

W has:
18 points in the top left
7 points in the right side
19 points in the bottom left
12 points at the bottom
komi 6.5
Summary, W has more than 60 points

B has:
12 points in the lower right
28 points in the top
9 points in the left side
Summary, B has less than 50 points

Since W has a safe lead and sente, he could easily win by making reducing/defencing moves like [A\], [B\], [C\], maybe [D\]]
;B[nb];W[nc];B[mc];W[jh];B[on];W[qn];B[oo];W[nq];B[hr];W[jr]
C[P: looking back I should have protected my bottom left corner.
Shedal: yes, it is the way bigger.];B[cq]C[Shedal: This is an interesting life and death problem, but it seems like B is unconditionally alive here :(
See variation to the next move.]

;W[fr]C[Shedal: you should be careful when making this move. B may be not so passive as in the game...
See var.]
(;B[ds]LB[ds:A][fq:B];W[fp];B[fo]
(;W[hn]LB[em:A]C[P: A bad move on my part. A move at A (E7) would have been a better attack point I believe.

Shedal: you cannot attack this B group with [A\], because it would be unconditionally alive in that case
See var. to the next move.];B[em];W[ar];B[bs]
(;W[dn]LB[fs:C][fq:D][dl:A]C[P: Again very bad, playing at A (E8) would have been better I think

Shedal: indeed, this move does not achieve anything.
If you want attack black, first of all you need the move at [C\]. Otherwise, B could connect with ko starting at [D\].
See variations.];B[ck]C[Shedal: Now B's position is steady and hardly attackable.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[ic];B[jc];W[he]LB[ib:A][jb:B]C[Shedal: bad shape. After this move, B could [A\] (see var.), getting many yose points in sente.
Yose is starting at this moment, so both sides must concentrate on getting points. Center does not have potential for that, so to take points on the side (with [B\]) is better.]

(;B[id];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[gf]TR[he]LB[fe:A]C[Shedal: [A\] seems like a better defence for me. Sente is bigger than the marked stone.]

(;W[kj]LB[kk:A]C[P: I did not read this out to well, too greedy, one move to the left would have probably been better.

C[P: Black resigned since white seems ahead by at least 10 points.


Shedal: There was no big mistakes in the game. Making shape and attacking also were not game-deciding skills.

I think the biggest problem (for both sides) is understanding the situation as a whole.
Score estimation is very helpful in the middlegame. I advice that you read Cho Chikun's "Positional Judgment".

Good luck in your way of Go :)])

[hr][hq][iq][ip]LB[rp:A]C[Shedal: this way the attack looks promising as either marked B group is not settled.
Still, I am not sure that attack is necessary. Your right-hand group may end up cutted off and even dead, if B gets to play [A\] first.
You should count the score again, then look if reducing / defencive moves will give you a win.
For example, you don't even need to cut here. Just make B think you are intended to :) and make territory on the side (see continuation)]
