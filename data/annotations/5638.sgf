(;B[qp]C[This move is a bit too slow. According to the Joseki, this move should be placed at R3. See the variation.]
;W[qm]C[By the way, this white move had better be at R3, coz it's right now the key point. The played move is too aggressive.]

(;B[qi]C[I guess I should have ran to the center with my weak group instead.

Mattias: No. Right now, the key point is still at R3. See the variation.]
;W[ro];B[qo]C[This is a bad shape, besides, it makes your group heavier and it does no good in making eyes or escaping. So better be at R3 as well.]

(;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[cf]CR[pd][pi][qi]C[This is a correct joseki, but to choose this joseki is not so good. coz right now, you have the three marked stones at the right side, and you could have developed the upper side and the upper right corner and tried to make it a moyo. see the variation at the 20th move.]
;W[dd];B[cc];W[df];B[cg];W[nc]C[This is an overplay, and it should be L17. So black should counter-attack at L17]
