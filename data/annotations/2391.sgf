AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer, 
I felt I was completly outplayed in that game. Even so I got 2 stones I was allready behind in the fuseki. Thus, this is the part of the game where I am most interested in.]
;W[pq];B[dc];W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb];W[ch];B[qo]
;W[pl];B[no];W[nq]C[I got this move the second time and really have no idea how to handle it. It is not in the joseki books I know. In the last game I tried n3, but with not so much success. This time I tried r3, not much better either... 
klin: O3 is relatively new.  I do not know all the variation yet.  B now can play P4 (sente) then Q10 (or Q11).]

;B[jp]C[klin:  I think B is OK with this result..];W[qf];B[nd]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[lc];B[ph]C[sita: It took a long time until I came up with this move. I felt he overplayed there, but did not know how to punish him. Now I felt the burden of the e17 weakness on me. That was why I thought of a play around j17, but I could not find a good follow up for this. 
klin: Q12 wrong direction.  Should K17.  If W M15 (or N15), B O14.]
;W[of];B[me];W[mf];B[le];W[ic];B[lf];W[mg];B[oj];W[nn];B[mn]
;W[mm];B[mo];W[mj];B[nm];W[ml];B[on]C[klin: B gives up two stones too easily.]
;W[nl];B[pn]C[klin: B Q6 should R7.  W R8, B S8, S9, S6.  B at least can get a sente.]
;W[nb];B[rd];W[qe];B[qd]C[klin: B R16 at Q17 a little bit better.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[pb]C[klin: Now B two stones on the right side may come alive.  For example, B P13 sente, then R13 sente.  Then R9, then S8, ... (Remember B S5 is sente.)]
;B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[fe];B[ec]C[klin: B E17 should E16.];W[ih]
;B[id];W[hc];B[qb];W[fn]C[sita: At that point I felt outplayed. I have the feeling that I am allready behind, but I did not see this coming...]
;B[gn];W[gm]C[sita: I regretted my move already. My plan was to play h6 etc to get nice territory at the bottom, but I realised that it would be the only territory I get at all, and that it would not be enough. That's why I played f7 instead.]
;B[fm];W[en];B[gl];W[hm];B[fk];W[em];B[fl]C[klin: B heavy.]
;W[dk];B[ik];W[jm];B[kk];W[kl];B[jh];W[hl];B[hk];W[gj];B[gk]
;W[ji];B[gi];W[kh];B[hh];W[hg];B[ii];W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[fj]
;W[ei];B[hj]C[klin: B lives.  It is not a bad result.];W[eq]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[cs]
;B[bp];W[es];B[hr];W[gs]C[sita: Seems I missed the last exit to resign here. I'm allready way behind?! 
klin: If you know the two stones on the right side are not dead yet, B is still in the game.  No comment beyond this point.]
