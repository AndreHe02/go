C[N: hello, in this game you made a mistake by allowing your top group to become very heavy. Your opponent helped you by making a bad invasion on the bottom, but you made some mistakes of direction and failed to finish him.
My comments are preceded by N: i hope they are helpfull.

(;W[db]C[I don't know if this is joseki. Looks like my shape is weaker than if I played e17.

N: it appears to be joseki, but a rare one];B[cf];W[cb];B[bc]
(;W[cm]C[I was wondering whether to play at top or left. g16 doesn't look so strong and here I could develop better, so I chose left side. I also couldn't figure proper move at top.

N: I think this is the wrong direction, the top side seems more urgent to help your group over there. Compare it to the classical joseki: there also white is making an extension on the side to stabilize his group.
 If your opponent plays on the right side, you have good responses over there.]

;B[ic];W[ie]C[N: now you seem to recover again, your group becomes a bit stronger and black top group is very low.]

(;B[fq]C[Bottom looks big, but result of this black invasion seems bad. White got solid corner + solid bottom group + sente, but I don't know where black should have played. h3 and d3 come to mind.

N: top is still urgent];W[dq]
(;B[fo]C[N: very bad];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[en]
(;W[dm]C[Is this proper shape?

N: Difficult question, your move seems to keep a nice ballance between top and bottom and attacking the black groop, however it seems to leave aji in the corner.]
(;B[hn];W[pn]C[I was thinking about sacrifacing this stone with something like r10, but after running out, black also seems to have problems.

o5 seems most natural, but it looks like black can lean on n3 easier. p7 looks also interesting, though weird shape.]
