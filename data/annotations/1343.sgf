C[Hi my name is Slawek Piela. I am Polish 8kyu I played Black in this Game.

I would be most interested in your comment especially on fuseki. I had a feeling that White  was much stronger in that phase of the game.

Another key issue for me in this game was move 102 at k16. Some thoughts on alternative moves to k16 would be appreciated.

Game was close all the way to the end when W made a blunder.

Thanks for your time spent on revieving my game.

;B[pd];W[eq];B[qp];W[op];B[dc];W[de];B[cp]C[I didnt like the idea of whites play in that corner. I much prefered leaving mine corners open to attack than let W. play c4

*schorsch*:
what's the problem with w playing the shimari?
If he does so, then b can still do the same, ideally after some
other sente move for b. Can't really be that bad overall, can it?

It's very tempting only to look at what w might get, and ignoring
that b has an almost identical position on the board at the very
same moment, while it is b's move.];W[cn];B[mq]C[again I rather faced a fight than let white get all bottom into his sphere of influence

*schorsch*:
picking a fight as b is not usually a good idea. I don't know
what your 6k and 9k igs ratings really mean, as you're playing
an even game. But assuming that w is indeed measurably
stronger, every fight is in w's interest. If b can make territory
with calm and reasonable moves, that might be a more
promising strategy.

The more complicated the situation on the board gets, which
is usually the consequence of a fighting playing style, the more
chance the stronger player has to lead b into making mistakes.]

;W[ps];B[sr];W[hq];B[oq];W[pp]C[I freaked out I think.
Should I have left my bottom group and play somewhere else?

*schorsch*:
p3 is indeed already wasted, and o2 is fully equivalent to a pass.
If you really wanted to do anything with this group, then it would
probably be to walk towards the center, in order to expand its
influence, and to seperate the two w groups.

But most likely, some move in the upper half of the board would
be much more interesting.];B[nr];W[qo];B[do]C[The idea was to strengthen C4 stone and possibly attack E3 group which looked weak between my two groups

*schorsch*:
D5 is the most peaceful move possible in this situation.
The w e3 group is not much weaker than both b groups,
so you might want to be careful about attacking it.

There is a rule of thumb in a situation like this, where you have
two w groups that you could attack. If you attach to one of them,
then that group will be strengthened, along with your own. After
that, you are likely to find yourself in a much better position to
really attack the *other* one. (attach/attack is *not* a typo :)

A typical approach would be E4, which w might answer with
either with f4 or d3. Whatever the details, the b corner group
will get a connection to the center, and a later b move around
c11 could then be tricky to handle for w.

You could also play hard on the C6 stone now, which gives w
the left side, but also strengthens the b corner group, and
might bring e3 into danger later in the game.];W[dn];B[dq];W[ep]
;B[dr];W[er];B[dp]C[*schorsch*:
D4 should rather be at E5, to connect to the center and
seperate the w groups. If you read the situation carefully,
you will find that w D4 can't really seperate the b stones.]
;W[eo];B[en]C[white didnt look that weak anymore :)
the reason I played E6 was this: if I let whit protect cutting point the influence of his e5 group wolud be huge. I hoped to cut W in two attack d6 stones and/or escape with e6 to the center

*schorsch*:
b did w a big favour, by allowing to be sealed into the corner.
And to make things worse, the b shape is very inefficient.
Cutting now is indeed an important move (though possibly
not the biggest available), but w finds a very considerate
and correct answer];W[dk];B[fn];W[go];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[gr]
;B[dg]C[I didnt really know what to do. I played this move as I felt it was 'fighting' move giving many possibilities. I thought white was getting huge territorial prospects if I just played anything else.

*schorsch*:
If you look at the whole board now, what do you see?

The bottom has been dealt with, and doesn't bring much
territory for anyone. The left side has some w influence,
but no secure territory yet. The top and right sides have
some b influence, with even less secure territory.

So, where's the best chance to make profit?
K16? Q11? N17 with an eye on Q10 later?
Even F16 might be promising, if w accepts the invitation
to take som territory on the left while giving some at top.
Again, picking fights generally brings an advantage to
the stronger player, while considerate play may be more
difficult for him to counter.];W[gn];B[fl]C[*schorsch*:
w does b the favour of not answering a very serious attack,
playing a fairly insignificant move. Why not take the top
left corner now, instead of saving those two meaningless stones?]

;W[dd];B[cd];W[cg];B[ch];W[bh];B[bi];W[dh];B[ci];W[eg]C[I simply did not foresee it...]
;B[di];W[ef];B[ej]C[I thought w stones were killable

*schorsch*:
luck has it, that a previously useless move now helps in
killing a w group... Of course, recognizing the chance
is still a good thing (even if w just dies due to a later mistake).]

;W[dl]C[I think W c7 would have given him life

*schorsch*:
looks like there are several ways to live here.];B[cm];W[bm]
;B[el];W[ck];B[em];W[ap];B[bo];W[ao];B[bp];W[an];B[aq]C[it was necessary right?

*schorsch*:
seems so, yes. w has no eye shape, but still more
liberties to potentially make up for that.];W[ec];B[db];W[ag]
;B[ai];W[eb];B[bb];W[ad];B[bd];W[ac];B[ae];W[da];B[ca]C[*schorsch*:
Given the cut potential at C17, C19 requires very careful
reading. Though in this situation, it seems to be ok.];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[ne]C[the biggest question of this game:
what should have I done?

I thought that if I manage to live small around k17 or escape to center the game is mine and over quickly.

I didnt play on the left as I didnt see a way to get much territory there for B

*schorsch*:
Again, it helps to look at the board as a whole.
The bottom is still about equal. To the left, b has made
around 30 points by capturing a w group. W still has no
territory worth talking about. So, where's the problem?

If w was to secure territory to the top above line 15, then
that would just about make up for the captured group
at left. But at the same time, b gets more territory on
the right side, still staying ahead. It's easy to reduce the
top territory even now with a move around k14 or k15
which can savely connect to the left b group.

So, again, don't worry if w "threatens" to make some
territory, just make sure you get more yourself!];B[jd]C[*schorsch*:
This move is too deep.
W can enclose b now, so that the b stone
either lives or dies. A very high risk strategy for b!
K15 is the classic move "at the opening of the gate",
which can easily escape without giving w much more
profit.];W[ea];B[be]C[*schorsch*:
B15 is a wasted move. what is b defending against?
The b stones in this corner have always one more liberty,
with every attack I can think of.

Playing K14 instead would solve every problem that b might
ever have had in this game...];W[jf];B[lc];W[le];B[ke];W[kf]
;B[ld];W[md];B[hc];W[ic]C[things didnt look bad but W was clearly better in close range fighting:)

;B[lg]C[L12 better?

*schorsch*:
The best thing would be not to fight there at all!
B has just helped w to make 40 points of secure territory
at the top, and will give away more points when losing
a few other stones in the ongoing fight.

One of the biggest moves would probably be around
R10 now.];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[nh];W[od];B[pb];W[li];B[na]C[*schorsch*:
N19 or P19 instead might connect the b groups,
though probably only with a ko at q17.  O19 is just the
one move that doesn't really work here.];W[ma];B[nb];W[ob];B[oa]
;W[mb];B[oc];W[mc];B[oe]C[I thought I could do something there - was there a way?

*schorsch*:
Nothing without risk, see my earlier comment.

P15 unnecessarily provokes an attack from w.
What would b lose with Q14 instead? That would
secure the M13 stones, and give a good basis for
jumping to R9.];W[of];B[pf];W[pe];B[qe];W[oh];B[oe];W[ng];B[qi]

;W[mh];B[nf];W[mf];B[ok]C[W ignored it.
I also considered N5

*schorsch*:
N5 (M5?) would be much better, since this has been the
weakest b group on the board for quite some time now.
Answering P9 is uninteresting for w, because b can enter the
center area from three sides anyway.

The rest of the game is quite a mess, with lots of  misreadings on both sides. I'm going to end
my comments here.

Hope my blurbs so far were instructive.

Have fun!
