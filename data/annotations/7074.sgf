AB[pd][dp]C[I enjoyed playing this game very much. I did not do very well in the opening, but in the middle and end there were a number of interesting fights.
I will appreicate some analysis of the opening and tactics.

Please also see my questions at the end points of variations  I looked at.

LB[fc:B][ch:A]
(;B[ch]C[I decided to play this move instead of F17, although I don't know which is best.
I am not sure how to cope with the situation that white is making kakari to the two corners and then make a 'tent shape'. I don't like it. see variations.

Nicksib:  Perfectly OK.];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be]
;W[bc];B[ce];W[fc]
(;B[qp]TR[ed][pd][po][dp]C[this move seemed natural to me, it is the first choice for empty corner.
Now in review, looking globally, this stone does not coordiante so nicely with the other black stones.

Maybe Q5 will be better? it takes less of the corner but is more in touch with the other stones.

Nicksib:  this move is OK....but I would play q5 in this position.  Influence is very important right now due to your wall and high 4-4 stones.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qm];W[iq]LB[pm:C][gq:A][qq:B]TR[jq]C[In the game, I only thought of blocking white moyo from the left while making corner terriotry.
In reivew, I consider Q7. However,l ooking in Kogo's dictionary,
(on http://eidogo.com),
 it recommends locally R3 instead, when white made the wide extension at J3 instead of K3.

Still Q7 will work nicely with Q16 and the other stones, although white also will build moyo.

I'm inclined for Q7. what do you think?]
(;B[gq]C[Nicksib:  At first glance, this appears to be correct direction.  However, w is over extended and even the direction is technically good, it makes w's shape stronger.]
;W[cn]C[my dillema: the corner is big and vulnerable, but a pincer around C8  is is big too. Which is better?

Nicksib:]
(;B[cp]C[I think this move is good shape with G3.

Nicksib:  shape is fine....but you're not taking control of the game.  when you play so solidly and conservatively, you need to work extra hard later to find correct time/point to truly strike.]
;W[ck]LB[dj:A][dm:B]C[my thoughts: top black group got cramped but I should you thickenss to attack white. However, I am worried about that C14 stone potential to complicate things.

Nicksib:  yep.  you took profit and gave w a little freedom in exchange.  now you have to live with that.]

(;B[dj]C[try to attack this way?
see variation too.];W[dk]LB[sa:B][bf:A]
(;B[bf]SQ[ck][dk][cn]C[I worried of white playing B14 . but is it big deal?

Nicksib:  can't make moves like this.  now b is over concentrated and is applying virtually no pressure to the marked group.  these last two moves are your first truly unfortunate mistakes.]
;W[ej]C[Nicksib:  large move....makes d9 group infinitely strong now and b is going to end up overconcentrated.]
;B[di]C[Nicksib:  blech.  w is already strong, and now you're letting w push you around.  have to tenuki and find an advantage somewhere else.]
;W[en];B[fp]C[Nicksib:  both your last move and w's last move are too conservative for handicap games.]
;W[ei]LB[eh:A][ek:B]C[I considered cutting at E9 but didn't think it will work right now

Nicksib:  cut is bad.]
(;B[eh]SQ[bf][dj]C[Nicksib:  i know it looks like good shape....but it really doesn't help all that much.  all it shows you is how poor d10 and b14 really were.  if you play d10....you HAVE to follow it up with another stone in that area.  w is very happy to push you around like this.]
;W[fh]
(;B[eg];W[fd];B[fg]C[Nicksib:  b should have done this before/instead of e13]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[gj]C[Nicksib:  looks like overplay.  Even if it isn't....w can gain an advantage now by pushing this stone around.]
;W[gk];B[ek];W[fk];B[el];W[fm]
(;B[ec]C[I know this push is usually bad, but I wanted to do something about the top side.
I didn't go well.

Nicksib:  the reason that the push is bad....See variation (sv)...]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[fb]
(;B[if]C[Nicksib:  i'm not sure what you're trying to do here.  the top left b group is already safe...f14 doesn't build territory, doesn't limit moyo.  see variation for other ideas.]
;W[id];B[kf]C[Nicksib:  again, this move does nothing.  It looks like it's aiming at f10...but sv....]

(;W[kd]TR[gb]C[now this stone look useless, I just helped white.]
;B[kq]C[Nicksib:  b needs some luck here.];W[hq]TR[eq]C[hmm
I think white as a threat at E3 now

Nicksib:  perhaps...but i don't think this is correct w response.  b should allow e3 is b can get n3 and counter attack right side.]

(;B[go];W[io];B[mq];W[qq]LB[pm:C][pp:B][rq:A]C[hmm
apparently joseki dictionary recommends now something like Q7 and sacrificing  two stones in the cornerwhich I didn't know.
But it doesn't seem right to give white such easy life

Nicksib:  right, you can't give w easy life now]

Nicksib:  game is over.  big moves still at s17 and f10.  I might argue that f10 is biggest because MAYBE there is still some sort of cut against the j7 group.]
