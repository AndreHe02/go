AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[siowy [9k\]: hi sir
siowy [9k\]: good luck have fun

Jeff: Hi.  I will mark my comments with my name as I have here.  The main challenges I see in this game for black are 1) connectivity, and 2) gaining from an attack.

I am new to reviewing games and would appreciate any feedback about my review.  Also plaease feel free to ask further questions or seek clarification on any of my comments.]
;W[qf];B[nc]C[jack74 [5k\]: hi gg];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[jp];W[qn]
;B[np];W[cf];B[gc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[cn];W[gq];B[eq]C[Jeff: I can see no glaring issues with these first moves.  I feel that white is too low as all her stones are on the 3rd or 2nd line.  Black has established a nice balance.  Perhaps a strong player might think O17 should be at O16 or O4 should be at O3, but I cannot claim to see these as bad.]
;W[lq];B[jq]C[Jeff:  Again a good play.];W[lo];B[nn];W[mo]
(;B[no]C[Jeff: Black can make better shape.];W[ho];B[jn];W[rp]
(;B[qq];W[lm]C[Jeff:  This is a key point.  Imagine a black stone here.]
(;B[mm]C[Jeff: Attaching to a stone means you are stating a defensive posture.  There is no reason for black to be defensive.]
;W[ko];B[jo]C[Jeff: This is a good connection.]
(;W[km];B[jm]C[Jeff: Here white is making too slow a run into the middle.  W has 2 groups and must get out fast, possibly sacrificing a portion of one of the groups.]
(;W[fo];B[gl]C[Jeff: This is a good attack.];W[em];B[ck]C[Jeff: Another good attacking move.  B9 attacks and takes profit at the same time.]
(;W[cl];B[dl];W[dm];B[ek];W[do];B[co];W[dn]C[Jeff: At this point black needs to make a decision.  B can kill the white stones or gain profit from his attacks.  Only kill if you know you can.  Otherwise it is better to take profit.]
(;B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[ep]
(;B[fp]TR[fn][dp]C[Jeff: This is a questionable move.  There is no reason for it.  These two B stones insure there is no eye.  I've looked at a number of variations and I do not see how white can be killed.  Taking the profit is much better.]

;W[dl];B[ej];W[cj]C[Jeff: It is white that takes the profit.  Look at board position at this move and at the end of the previous branch.  This is the outcome of greed by B.]

;W[sb];B[qa];W[sr];B[jj];W[jk];B[ih];W[jg];B[qs]C[Jeff: Now you can anser this.  Do not simply answer moves even if they are locally senty.  If you have sente moves that are bigger, then w has to answer them first.  Playing the endgame this way can get you a few more points and these are very important.

It requires a lot of counting.  Sometimes byo yomi does not give you time, but eventually you'll learn what end game moves are worth, especially if you analyize your own games and take the time to count during analysis.]
