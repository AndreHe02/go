C[Ted: I'm Ted Schuerzinger, and I'm reviewing the game you sent in.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I think the big problem in this game isn't not knowing how to handle White's moyo, but letting White get a big moyo in the first place.]

;W[nc];B[qf];W[kd];B[cn];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[dk]C[Ted: I think this move is a bit slow. I'd either play at R10 or something aggressive like F3.  The thing is, if White tries to play around here, there's no good place for White to make a base.]

(;B[qm]C[Ted: Another move that I think is too slow.  Pincer from the top.]

Ted: Correct.];W[of]
(;B[oc]C[Ted: I'd either play O16, or something more aggressilve, like Q13, trying to split the two marked stones.  See the variation]

(;B[cf]C[Ted: The empty triangle is bad!  Look at the board if you had played D15 instead.]
;W[de];B[dg]C[Ted: Slow, and you're doing exactly what White wants, which is to be able to build a moyo.]
;W[fg];B[oq]C[Ted: Another slow move.  I'd try something in the M4 or F4 area]
;W[np];B[nr]C[Ted: I think this is too early, and you would have been better off trying to reduce White by playing M4.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[lq];B[mm]C[This is probably not a very strong move. Trying to prevent white from building a huge moyo in the center, but didn't know how to do that.

Ted: I think the simplest way would be to play tengen, and figure out a way to connect to one side or the other.

Although I've been criticizing your earlier moves as being slow, you're not as far behind as I've been making you out to be, in part because White still has a weakness around F4 or G4 that can be exploited, while you've got a nice amount of territory on each side.  There's also the peep at P12.]
;W[fj];B[fq]C[Ted: Good idea, although I think it's one line too deep.  Before White played C5, I think you can get away with invading on the third line, because you can respond with C3 if necessary.]
;W[eq];B[eo]C[Ted: Knight's moves when you're trying to escape with a running group are just begging to be cut.]
