RE[W+3.5]

C[Hi, my name is Peter - Im 5k kgs and I'm your reviewer. My name's petition online, and if you ever see me on kgs, I'd be glad to play a game with you. Throughout this review, any comments I put will have P: before them. If i've inserted a variation, I'll write 'see variation'. I use b to refer to black, and w to refer to white. Any terms I use that you aren't familiar with can be found on sensei's library.

This was a very exciting game, with neither player wanting the other to make solid territory or settle their groups too easily. Lots of fighting for the whole game. You played quite a lot better than your opponent, so it's difficult to see your mistakes, but in this review, I'll be focussing on a few main concepts: sente, size of moves, and making territory while attacking,

Let's go!];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[what about this? is komoku too slow with white against a double hoshi? I with white do komoku-hoshi or double hoshi. with black i do komoku-hoshi, double komoku, komoku-sansan or hoshi-sansan

P: Questions about the placement of the first four stones are difficult to answer with any certainty. I basically always do either komoku-hoshi or double hoshi, though I admire that you open with sansan as black. I think komoku is fine here, and this pattern is very common among strong dans and pros.]
;B[co];W[ep]C[I sometimes use this joseki, not often though

P: This move is often called too slow, although it was apparently popular in the past. I never play it, but it seems good and solid.]
;B[cq];W[jq]C[maybe too far away, maybe too low, maybe C2?

P: Yeah, that stone is too far away. There's a bad weakness at f3 in this shape -- this shape is fairly common in kyu games, the diagonal bump against a stone on the third line, so remember that weakness when you play it or see it.
. Usual moves in this joseki are to exchange wc2 for bb3, then wh3. If w had a stone in the lower right corner, we6 could also be good instead of h3, to get the wall]
;B[dp]C[P: It's foolish for b to lean on w like this, as it forces w to fix his shape. b proceeds to give w a nice wall, making it so that the k3 stone is no longer too far away.]
;W[do];B[cp];W[eq]C[P: W says thank you to black, and will again after b's two next moves.]

(;B[dn]C[P: See variation];W[eo];B[dm]C[p: Unnecessary and small and gote]

(;W[nc]C[I tought about K5 but it seemed too small for this part of the game

P: W takes sente for a huge move.
I prefer approaching at r6 over o17. It establishes a position in b's area of influence, and forces b to develop towards your wall (as the proverb says, play away from thickness) See variation]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jd]C[I belive its better than L17 this time]
;B[hc];W[ic]C[I picked this over F17 because it puts more pressure on the black stone

P: here's that shape again -- watch out for the weakness at l17. i prefer j18 here for w]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[id];W[jc];B[hb]C[P: Again, b helps you become stronger. this is so much better for w than for b, because while w builds solid territory, b doesn't get much mroe stable because wd16 is right there.

Also, in this sequence (which is common), bh16 is the better move here. you are correct to cut immediately.]
;W[hd];B[db]
(;W[gd]C[P: This move is small and in the wrong direction. there isn't much in terms of points on the upper side right now, and the corner is open so b can live easily, nothing really to attack. see variation]
;B[fc];W[gc];B[gb];W[ec];B[eb];W[fd];B[fb];W[cc]C[P: w is leaning too hard and leaving too many cut points and too much bad aji. this will come back to haunt you later. it's best to favour straight lines.]
;B[cb]C[I really cant comment fighting, you say if you see some of my blunders or better moves]
;W[bb];B[ca];W[ie]C[I belive this play with black would have been huge

P: it's not so big, because the w group above and below are both safe. all b would be doing by running is creating a weak group for you to chase. w j15 is overconcentrated. extending on the left side is essential. imagine if w had played c9 instead of j15]
;B[ee]
(;W[de]C[P: It's best to simply respond to the peep as in this variation. playing this contact play wd15 makes b stronger while w becomes further overconcentrated with even more bad cut points. it is because of this sequence that it was a close game rather than w+a million. the painfulness of this peep also shows how important it was that w play on the left side first, making good use of the hard earned sente from the top side.]
;B[df];W[eg];B[dg];W[ef];B[dh];W[cj]C[P: You try for too much here and it ends badly. It is unreasonable to try and kill these stones.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[cd];W[ce];B[bc]
(;W[bh]C[P: Your goal here seems to be to undercut the three black stones, so as to force them to run and pin them against your mighty wall.unfortunately, this move makes it possible for black to connect, and the option for b to run is still open. consider the variation.]
;B[bg];W[ch];B[cg]C[P: From here, b can either connect or run, and w can choose which happens. w wisely chooses to play high before playing low, following the proverb,]
;W[ei];B[di];W[dj];B[eh];W[fh]C[P: black choose to cut w up before connecting.]
;B[fi];W[ej];B[fg];W[gh];B[ff]C[P: Capturing for one eye in gote, very bad. w could simply have played b15 and the b group would be dead.]
;W[bf]C[P: right idea, unfortunate error.];B[ag];W[gg]C[terrible, I simply didnt see that, dont know what happened to me]
;B[be];W[ae];B[bd];W[cf];B[af];W[gj];B[fk];W[fj];B[hi];W[hj]
;B[gi];W[ii];B[hh];W[hg];B[fe];W[nq]C[P: nicely done last few moves! linking your groups up and taking sente for a big point. I still prefer r6 tho...]
;B[pr]
(;W[or]C[P: this move is small and weak, leaving that same weakness around n2. bq2 is  a greedy move, trying to get a solid territorial lead and force w to take risks. better for w to stay light and play the second approach at r6, leaving b with few possibilities. see variation]
;B[qq]C[P: you play r6 only after forcing b to fix his shape with r3, giving b more possibilities.]
;W[qn]C[P: B can pincer now safely, of can attack w at m2,m3]
;B[qo]C[maybe risking too much, but I belive Im a bit behind and I need to do some risky things. and, his group is a bit weak

P: this isn't risky, this is good for you. b plays a small move that strengthens w inside of b's sphere of influence.]
;W[pn];B[hq]
(;W[ip]C[P: this diagonal move favours the area around g3, which is already quite strong, whereas the area around m3 is quite weak. better to play k5 here, balancing support for the two sides. see variation]
;B[lq];W[np]C[too slow?];B[lo]
(;W[hn]C[killed H3, still the two stones are weak

P: bh3 is already dead, this move is unnecessary. better to chase the b stones from the other side and build influence on the right side. see variation. w's biggest priority should b to make an extension on the right side. a mvoe there is huge for points and also threatens  the black group in the top right. the b stones on m line are comparatively unimportant, except that they let you become strong.]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[lp];W[ko];B[lm];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn]C[now when I look at this maybe L7 is better

P: this is a wasted move. you are chasing from the wrong side - building up a strong postion that faces a strong position is a waste of time. meanwhile, black's wall faces the right side, which is by far the most important area of the board. unfortunately, you also now need a move to connect the o3 stones to the q6 ones, so it's seeming unlikely you will get the extension.]
;B[kl]C[P: fortunately, this is also a wasted move. b pushes into nowhere.]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[ik];B[il];W[jm]C[P: none of these moves do anything. this area of the board is not valuable. w is too strong there for b to hope to connect through it, and it's open to both sides so it's worthless for territory, or at least too small to fight over right now.]
;B[lk];W[el]C[P: you play this sequence well, sealing off territory and defending your position. however, it's too small for the time being. b could happily ignore this 10-15 point move and play one worth at least twice as much on the right.

there is a valuable proverb that states - Play into open space.]

C[P: Good reading! very coolly handled];B[dr];W[gs];B[fs];W[ho]
;B[er];W[go];B[fr]C[P: this is a puzzling move by black. it is a half-point gote move. if b had played around r9, the game would be over.]
;W[pj]C[P: it's better to play on the third line here, but the three-space extension is just righ. third line is best because you know b will make a counter-extension towards you, as it is the next biggest move available. it's also very nice that your o3 stones are safe, with two strong positions to connect to at will.]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[qi];W[rj];B[qj];W[qk];B[ri];W[rk];B[ol];W[pl]
;B[om];W[oo]C[made sure both groups are alive. If he comes inside to kill eyes I jump out and if he closes me in I make eyes

P: very solid play.];B[pm];W[qm];B[jj];W[ih]C[P: there is no need to respond to b k10. your groups are safe without it, and the biggest point on the board is around o14.



each time your opponent plays a move, ask yourself if responding to it is urgent. if it is not urgent (which usually means it is small, like the a small reduction in territory, the capture of some unimportant stones), play a big point elsewhere. being the first one to move to the next area is how games are one. always be aware of where the biggest points are, and play them without hesitation whenver your opponent attempts something smaller.]
;B[kh]C[P: w's chance of enlarging the moyo is gone...];W[oi]
;B[ph];W[nh];B[og]C[P: w o12 doesn't do much. wp11 was a fine move that kept b from formint a moyo, but w012 is pushing b into w's area of influence. this only gets worse after w013. best to n15 and enlargen territory as much as possible.]

;B[sh];W[sj];B[rh];W[oh];B[pf];W[pa];B[ra];W[ci];B[gf]C[P: you ask for comments on yose - there are many moves in this yose that are not worth any points. especially in yose, and double especially in close games like this, it is necessary to know how much every possible move is worth, and whether those moves are sente or gote. play sente moves first, then the largest gote move available. as you seem to know, double sente points are not yose and should be played as soon as possible. 

 look at the difference between the score if w plays somewhere first or b play somewhere first. If w gets three points if s/he plays in an area first, and b could get 2 (assuming these moves are sente for both sides), the size of the move for either side is five. look up miai counting on sensei's library for a detailed analysis of how to tell which move to play when.]
;W[hf]C[P: this move is not urgent and is 1 point in gote, preventing a 1 point gote move by b. best to play elsewhere.]
;B[am];W[al];B[an];W[ah];B[ad];W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[rr]C[P: I'm not sure why b did this... perhaps b thought it would be bent 4 in the corner? it would not.]

(;W[bm];B[bn];W[cm];B[cn];W[ej]C[P: wc10 is a litte stronger now, and it is becoming harder for b to run. b could connect under now with bb15, but w would welcome the chance to play e12 or somesuch move and link up the two groups, building strength in sente. but if b jumps out, then w can attack and be left with the option of cutting off b's connection. variation continues to show b connecting, tho i think it's better for b to run and attack the four weak w stones.]
