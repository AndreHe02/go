C[Hi,
i hereby request a review of this game, played at 02-Sep-2005 on KGS between Juninho[unknown rank\] as W and jug[myself,30k?\] as B. Edited SGF with cgoban-2.6.12.

* Info about me (jug):
I started playing Go Jan-2004 but stopped it after a month, restarted playing a few weeks ago. Played many quick games against GnuGo (with H9) but always lost (no surprise), played few games against real persons on KGS. I learned Go with a book and read beginner's sections on Sensei's Library.

* Info/opinion about my opponnent (Juninho):
Though he states to never have played on a 19-board, it came out, that IMHO he's a strong player or maybe I am a weak one ;)
It would interest me how strong you would rank him at the end of the game.

* Info about the game:
19x19, no handicap, Komi 6.5, Japanese Scoring, no time limit (the game lasted 3,5 hours).
At the beginning i didn't realized this was a game without time-limits until move 40 or so. Until then i played relatively quick, after that i thought very hard.
I must admit, this game was my hardest ever played so far, but it was a hell of fun and to my surprise i've won it (but only with luck IMHO ;)

* Info about my reviewing:
After the game we (Juninho, TrangOul[23k?\], jug) reviewed it, but it was a very short one, find some comments questionable and mostly got no answer to questions. I've also included the comments from that, but moved some to the move before (hope that's not confusing).

Before sending it to GTL, i've translated all comments to english (was german) and additionally included my thoughts about B (and W) moves along with questions starting with label 'jug' (instead of 'jug[30k?\]' from the normal game-review).

When i marked moves, marker 'A' is always the main-road of playing for the current player, other markers are about alternative thinkings for B or W.
Maybe you can add reviewer comments starting with 'R:' or some other prefix you prefer. Final evaluation and general advice i would prefer in the last node.

Well, enough introduction, let's start ...

Thanks in advance for your effort of reviewing this game, Kind regards, jug.


Hello, I'm alaric and I'll be reviewing your game today.  I'm around 16kyu KGS.  I'll proceed all comments with "alaric:".  I won't presume you know japanese terminology so I'll give quick translations when I use them the first time (if you already know the japanese terms, all the better).]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: should have connected earlier
jug: don't know what this comment should mean?

alaric: That comment is completely out of place here, not sure what he would mean by that.  You have both opted for the Nirensei (two star) opening.  This is a popular modern opening that infesizes influence over territory.  It's also very good for new players in many peoples opinions.  I like it for new players because it can lead to big moyo (potential territory) games that are a bit easier to read than a more highly contested board, and it is good for learning whole board positioning.]
;B[dg]TR[fc][nc]SQ[cf][qf][jp]C[alaric: This is not typical.  If you are going to approach a 4-4 point the favored joseki ("corner play" or "established way of playing") is the knights move approach.  It is better to approach from below in this case because that is where you have support and where white is weak.  Therefore C14 or R14 is very common here.  Approaching from inside whites two points (F17 or O17) would generally be considered weaker.  Alternatively, instead of approach a white corner you can play the Sanrensei (Three Star) opening by playing K4.]
;W[dj]TR[dg]SQ[fd][jd][cj][qn]C[alaric:  Because D13 is not a very fierce attack on the corner white can afford to tenuki (play away from the current tactical situation) if he chooses, for example, by playing R6.  The two point high approach on the 4-4 is very rare, but Kogo's Joseki Dictionary suggests C10 or F16 for responses.  My natural feeling is to play something like K16 here.  Regardless, the 2 point high pincher to a 2 point high approach creates no urgency on either side.]
;B[fc]C[alaric:  Maybe better to tenuki here.  One of the problems new players have the most trouble with is learning when to tenuki and when not to.  The main way to determine when it is appropriate is to determine if there is any urgency to a play in the local area.  Since you have both played light loose plays in this corner there isn't alot of urgency.  If you don't play in this area, and white attacks your stone it won't be particularly dire, you should find a way to live or escape fairly easily.  In the same way no attack form you here is particularly brutal.  So you should feel free to play anywhere you want in this case.

Saying that, this is a fine play for black.];W[ff]SQ[ee][fe]
[cf]C[alaric: White has the right idea, but this is the wrong way to go about it.  Given two weak stones, it's never wrong to split them, but this connection is to tenuous.  I think E15 or F15 would be a bit more solid, and still let's white escape to the middle.  If white wants to try to live underneath then C14 is probably good, but that will likely give white an outward facing wall in an influence game, which would not be good here.]
;B[fe];W[ee]LB[ed:A]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: E16 was a bad move
jug: A is a bad move, but what else to play here?

alaric:  You could try to push into the corner with D17.  If you looking for a fight, then the crosscut at E14 looks interesting.  That would lead to an  ugly fight early on, but I think you would have the advantage there.  The reason A is not good here is that white can atari (leave a stone with one liberty) to force you to become overconcentrated.]
;B[ed];W[ge];B[fd];W[de];B[dc];W[cc]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: E16 was bad because W could play D18
jug [30k?\]: oh]
(;B[cb]C[jug [30k?\]: F16 i found poor choice, uncool for B

alaric:This is bad, white atari at D18 let's white take back the corner.]
;W[bc]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: here W could play more aggressive
Juninho [30k?\]: oh well!];B[db];W[pj]LB[jp:A]C[jug: i played A, seemed "small" to me, better play?]
;B[jp]SQ[nc]C[alaric:  K4 is good hear, it's one of the last remaing big points on the board.  The only other place I would consider would be O17, and try to connect to the top left group.]
;W[jj];B[qc]SQ[nc]C[alaric: Too early.  You are trading minimal points for a white wall in a direction of whites choosing.  Most beginners see this move as denying white the big corner.  The reason this is wrong is that a 4-4 stone doesn't claim the corner, it's an influence play, not a territory play.  It's profit comes from territory in the center or side.  A knights move approach generally splits the corner roughly evenly, and would be much better here.]
;W[pc]C[alaric: Wrong direction.  This direction faces towards a black formation.  The alternate direction faces a white stone.  White is more likely to take territory on the left than at the top at this point.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[pe]SQ[qf]C[alaric: R14 is the joseki here.]
;B[pb]C[alaric: The continuation is usually White R14, Black S14, White R13.  Given that white didn't block against it I think R14 is probably good here. It rips right into what should have been fairly solid white territory.]
;W[ob]LB[qb:B][rb:A]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: 'B' is more secure
jug [30k?\]: hm, right

alaric: B is correct here.  A just opens you up to a Ko threat.  Learn the 3-3 invasion under 4-4 so you feel comfortable playing it.]

(;B[rb]LB[pa:A][qb:B]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: W should play R18 instead]

(;W[pa];B[qb];W[rf]LB[rd:B][sd:A][se:D][sf:C]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: next better at 'B' not 'A'
jug [30k?\]: 'C' at T14 doesn't work, doesn't it?
Juninho [30k?\]: or 'D' at T15
TrangOul [23k?\]: oh well,'D' is possibility for ko-threat

alaric: B is best here.  It's solid and simple, and you are alive at that point, don't make things more complicated than they need to be.]

(;B[sd];W[sf]
(;B[nc]TR[ob][pc][pd][pe][qe][rf]SQ[bc][cc][dd][de][ee][ff]
[dj][jj][pj]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: weird move
Juninho [30k?\]: running out, though not secure

jug: before that move, i feared W's influence to the left (triangles) and potential big territory around the center and the left (boxes).
I should have avoided that earlier, but i often loose groups by leaving too early, and i considered my group to be secure.

alaric: Go proverb "Don't threaten to cut, cut".  This threatens the cut at P17, but it would be better to just cut if that is your intenion.  Looking at the board as it currently is it  looks like black will get a large chunk of the bottom territory, white will get a large chunk of the middle territory, and who gets the top probably decides the game.  Generally you don't want to play close to your own wall, but the white stone at G15 threatens to push down hard if black tries to extend to far.  So something around K16 might be good.  Another place that looks interesting is cutting at E14 (to create aji (potential for problems)) then to approach the white stone at D10.]
;W[se];B[rd];W[qa]C[alaric: Bad.  This gives up sente for little gain.]
;B[ra];W[oa]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: 2 eyes are already there...]
;B[sb]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: that wasn't neccessary, would have been impossible for W to kill, you always have 2 eyes here...
jug [30k?\]: yeah, lost sente (me stupid move), what was i thinking: bent-four always lives

alaric:  You already see it, but this hurt.  You are at a fairly critical point in the game and giving up sente here for no gain is hard.]
;W[oc]SQ[oa][pa][qa][ob]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: gote, not needed

jug: really?

alaric: It's gote, but I don't see how you save the marked stones without connecting here.]
;B[ic]C[alaric:  Too close i think, you could have extended a bit further.]
;W[jd];B[he];W[gf];B[je]SQ[jd]C[Juninho [30k?\]: here i can escape
jug: how?
Juninho [30k?\]: see game-play
jug [30k?\]: i didn't wanted to be cut off from the center
Juninho [30k?\]: naturally

jug: what's the meaning of escaping?

alaric: The marked white stone is in peril, and is partially cut off.  His choice is to try to live underneath your, or escape.  Escape means eaither to connect to a living group (such as reach the top right white group) or breaking out to the center where there is room to live.

The point Juninho is making is that your move does not prevent white from escaping, so the the move is probably not good.  In the same vein, but probably better would be J16.]
;W[id];B[hd];W[ie];B[jc]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: but now are cut away from the center
jug [30k?\]: sadly yes
TrangOul [23k?\]: you hardly have influence to the center

alaric: True, but it was going to be hard to end up with influence from that position to begin with, better (I think) to take some territory, then try to reduce the center while securing territory at the bottom.]
;W[hf]LB[kd:A][if:B]SQ[nc]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: 'B' would have worked
Juninho [30k?\]: oh well, who knows
jug [30k?\]: i thought of 'B' ..., but didn't played it

alaric:  I don't like B here.  That seems to encourage white to push to the right, which is bad for black.  Even if black connects to the mark stone white destroys that territory with a monkey jump.  A is sente, and allows black to push into the center a bit.]

(;B[kd];W[if];B[jf]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: ok, there is minimal influence to the middle

alaric:  Your collecting alot of weak points in that group, I would have prefered something more solid like L15 here.]
;W[jg];B[ke];W[lf]LB[me:B][ne:A]C[jug [30k?\]: i didn't figured out yet how to play "bigger" moves, ... but hey, i'm still a beginner, much testing out and experiment
Juninho [30k?\]: would 'B' on N15 be better?
TrangOul [23k?\]: no, wouldn't be good either
jug [30k?\]: what else?
TrangOul [23k?\]: on M or N15
Juninho [30k?\]: ok
TrangOul [23k?\]: after B on 'A' should have cut on 'B', making B's territory smaller

alaric:  I would think tenuki here is best, the area you are fighting in should end up mostly filled when you are finished, I just don't see many points there.  There are huge amounts of open territory on the bottom half of the board.]
;B[ne]
(;W[nf]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: he hadn't cut you, ... you were lucky
TrangOul [23k?\]: was a mistake by W
Juninho [30k?\]: ??
Juninho [30k?\]: difficult choice];B[me];W[mf]LB[dk:A]C[jug: unsure what to do next?
thought of how to win more land, but how to do that?];B[dk]
C[alaric: Go proverb "Touching a stone makes it stronger".  Usually when you want to assault a stone you don't touch it, instead you approach it and try to cut it off.  When you make a contact play you force your opponent to respond, since he has the first stone in the area this generally leads to a disadvantagous position for you.]
;W[ej]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: influence to the middle or reduce territory of opponent...
Juninho [30k?\]: yes];B[ck]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: i would take the second
jug: ?

alaric: He seems to be refering to the second line, ie B9.]
;W[cj]LB[bk:A]C[jug: again W builds wall, arg, how to avoid that? maybe on the edge?

alaric:  When you made the contact move what where you expecting white to do?  If white wants to trade you a wall on line 10 or a wall on line 9 I'd take it.]
;B[bk]C[alaric: The center is more important here, better at F9 or G9.]
;W[bj]LB[ak:B][ek:A][el:C]C[jug [30k?\]: nice wall

alaric: Any aji that E13 or the cut at F14 had is gone though.  It is often better to setup aji before your actual attack.  This leaves your opponent defensive, trying to protect against the potential problem.  Even if it's just  a feint you can gain more territory from your attack because your opponent will play more cautiously.]

(;B[ek]C[jug [30k?\]: too small move ?

alaric: You are strong enough to jump out and get ahead of white, F9 instead.]
;W[fk]LB[fj:A]C[jug: 'A' experimental play];B[fj]LB[fi:A][el:B]
C[TrangOul [23k?\]: this is weird move
Juninho [30k?\]: unneccessary
jug [30k?\]: experiment

TrangOul [23k?\]: 'B' at E8 would have been better for W];W[fi]
;B[gj]SQ[mj][ql]C[alaric: What is your intention here?  White is strong all around here, so I don't think this is good.  G8 is sente, and helps potect the left side, then you can move to somewhere else.  Some moves that look interesting would be an invasion at N10 (a point between two opponents stones that is halfway from both of them is often a good point for an invasion), or maybe approach on the right at R8.]
;W[gk];B[hi]C[alaric:  Again, what is the goal, white is strong all around, and there isn't enough space to live.  This looks like you are helping white build territory and throwing him stones as he goes.]
;W[gi]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: oO experiment XD];B[hj];W[hh];B[ei]
TR[fi][gi]SQ[fk][gk]C[TrangOul [23k?\]: aeh...
TrangOul [23k?\]: what was that?
Juninho [30k?\]: how would you get land here?
jug [30k?\]: aimed to threat F/G11 (triangles)
jug: foolish

alaric: better would be to threaten the other stones (squares) and try to escape, although that hurt as well.  In all this line of play is not going well.]
;W[eh]C[jug [30k?\]: realized too late (in some moves), that we have a ladder here ;(
jug [30k?\]: @TrangOul: which is real rank?
TrangOul [23k?\]: 18k];B[di];W[dh];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[cg]C[jug [30k?\]: oh no, it's a ladder

alaric: Yes, more complex than a simple ladder, which is why you probably missed it, but a ladder none the less.]
;B[hk]C[Juninho [30k?\]: unneccessary
TrangOul [23k?\]: ok then N8
Juninho [30k?\]: extend your territory
jug [30k?\]: ok?

jug: well it sorted out that this wasn't that bad at all against my opponent (see later).

alaric:  I don't think this is bad.];W[hl];B[gl]SQ[hi][fj][gj]
[hj][hk]C[jug: now the big mess in the center and SW-corner begins. Here and the next moves in that area i had very hard thinking, whether to kill or not to keep sente.

alaric: You can't kill this group rapidly, and even if you could you shouldn't.  Killing two stones in gote is worth 4 points, surely you can come up with a sente series worth more than 4 points.  Now if your intention was to save the marked stones, and to removing the aji those white stones have then you are thinking on the right lines, and this starts to be more worthwhile.]
;W[fl]C[Juninho [30k?\]: would like to Atari me and running into Atari yourself+
jug [30k?\]: often happens to me];B[gm];W[fm];B[il]C[Juninho [30k?\]: that makes the situation for G8 even worse]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[hn];B[fo]C[jug [30k?\]: aimed to not loose upper group]
;W[ho]C[Juninho [30k?\]: yes];B[hp];W[go];B[fn];W[fp]C[Juninho [30k?\]: here i got to greedy
jug [30k?\]: hm yeah. This situation was like touching an electrical wire ;)]
;B[gp];W[eo];B[en];W[do]C[jug: oh no, W is invading the corner and has F4 in place. Somehow must do something against this...

alaric: You created weak groups, to save those weak groups you have to give up something.  White strength in the corner is what you are giving up in this case.]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[io]C[jug [30k?\]: never played without time-limit ;)]
;W[dn];B[em];W[ml]LB[pm:A]SQ[ok][ol]C[jug: how to play here?

alaric: play to reduce whites center.  You have sente now, try to keep it for awhile.  A is an okay territory move but isn't sente.  The shoulder hit at P9 looks interesting to me.  If he tries to surround you there are lots of holes and a good bit of room to play with.  If he blocks you'll probably get a wall facing towards your corner stone.  If you think P9 is a little aggressive, P8 is a little safer and has much the same effect.]
;B[pm];W[ol]LB[om:A]C[jug: better, not to connect here ? unsure]
;B[om];W[nm];B[qk];W[pl];B[ql];W[qj];B[rj]SQ[nn]C[alaric: Compare this move to O6.  How much territory are you going to gain by this, and how much do you stand to lose if white pushes down there.  The benefit of your move is that it helps against the cut at R7.]
;W[ri];B[sk]C[alaric: Generally better to just make the solid connection at S9.  It avoids unnecessary ko threats.]
;W[si];B[pk]C[Juninho [30k?\]: ho
jug [30k?\]: that was extremly stupid, wasn't it?
Juninho [30k?\]: yes];W[ok];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[qi]TR[se]
[rf][sf][ri][si][pj][qj]SQ[oe][of][qf]C[jug: I tried to attack (triangles) and to connect somehow (boxes). Hard thinking here, but reading more than 3-5 moves ahead is very difficult. Don't know, if any of this has chance of success...

alaric:  This doesn't look to promising, and even if it was there is still alot of big moves (like O6).  Saying that, you are still experimenting at this level of play so no reason not to try invasions like this.  Over time you'll figure out what is worth trying and what isn't.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg]C[jug [30k?\]: was exciting ;)];W[rg]
LB[qf:B][ih:A]C[jug [30k?\]: was one of my experiments ;)]
(;B[ih]C[Juninho [?\]: puh
Juninho [30k?\]: lucky me
jug [30k?\]: i thought, i cannot kill it (shortage of liberties), ... or ? (-> see variation 'B' last move)]
;W[qf];B[gh];W[fh];B[hg];W[gg]LB[jh:A]C[jug [30k?\]: 'A' so bad?
Juninho [30k?\]: see my answer];B[jh];W[hh]C[Juninho [30k?\]: one ...]
;B[kg]LB[kf:B][ig:A]C[Juninho [30k?\]: loer!
Juninho [30k?\]: you are not reacting
jug [30k?\]: i considered the possibility to connect at 'B' on L14 more important
Juninho [30k?\]: oh well, but not against two stones
jug [30k?\]: ah so

jug: really ? have 2 stones more weight here?
I thought B would catch my bait at 'A' and i can connect at 'B'.]
;W[ig]C[Juninho [30k?\]: two

alaric: There is a big area in the middle bottom that is unclaimed.  Capturing single stones is not worthwhile at this point in the game, there are bigger moves.]
;B[kf];W[le];B[ld];W[oe];B[ki]SQ[jj][ok][ml][ol][pl][nm];W[kj]
LB[mi:A]TR[pk][qk][ql][om][pm][kn][ln][mn]SQ[ok][ml][ol][pl]
[nm][no][np][nq]C[jug: something better than 'A' ?
thought of securing lower board at 'B' or around that, but was unsure

alaric: B doesn't secure the bottom because white could push through at O6. Someone shoud have played in that area for a long time.  Don't get to entangled in the local area of  play.

There are usually big points to be made at the juncture of two opposing moyos.  The marked stones are the two moyos here.  The first person to play at O6 gets the advantageous wall.  If white plays he gets a wall like the squared line.  If black plays first he gets a wall like the triangle line.  Notice the difference in territory for both sides between those to lines.  There isn't anything else on the board that will get you that many points.]
;B[mi]LB[mj:A][nk:B]TR[of][kg][lg][mg][qg][qh][qi]C[jug: tried to connect somehow to (triangles), but hopeless, it's too far away.

[no:B]C[jug [30k?\]: what else than 'A' ?
Juninho [30k?\]: 'A' was correct, but you don't see your friends again
jug[30k?\]: friends ?
Juninho [30k?\]: you can run down
jug: ... and ?];B[lj]C[jug [30k?\]: this one was not so good, wasn't it?
Juninho [30k?\]: i had expected that];W[mk]SQ[nj][oj]C[jug: was surpised by that one, should have read better.
Juninho [30k?\]: no, i already have them (boxes)
jug [30k?\]: yes

alaric: you should not expect to save the marked stones.  But they have aji, and you used their aji to get a move in in sente that would otherwise not be, so they served their purpose.]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[kl]C[jug: this was one was a mistake, but didn't see it.

alaric: trying to do to much, better to just connect solidly at L9.]
;W[kk];B[li];W[jl]LB[kl:1]C[jug: oh no, now the hard thinking begins again, when to kill and how to set moves to keep everything connected.
'1' was a mistake :(];B[im];W[km];B[kn]C[jug [30k?\]: hm?
Juninho [30k?\]: see no error of B here];W[ln];B[ko];W[lo];B[lp]
;W[mp];B[no];W[lq]LB[kp:B][nq:A]C[Juninho [30k?\]: you donated me astoundingly many stones
jug [30k?\]: well, thought other moves more important. Would it be better to save it at 'B' ?

alaric: what is the value of saving one stone?  Don't get too attached to single stones, sacrifice them when you need to when there are more important plays to be made.]

(;B[nq];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[ks];B[mg]C[Juninho [30k?\]: why this ?
jug [30k?\]: better played at K1 ?
Juninho [30k?\]: here it is practically finished
Juninho [30k?\]: i can always connect

alaric: I could K1 as 5 points in sente.  N13 is a bit more open, but I don't think it gets very much, this area is probably dame (worth 0) either way.]
;W[ng];B[nh]C[alaric: Doesn't server much of a purpose, your force white to respond with something that makes him stronger, and threatens your stone.]
;W[oh];B[js]C[jug: why that ? can't remember.];W[lr];B[mn]LB[mh:A]
[lm:C][mm:B]SQ[nb]C[Juninho [30k?\]: ok, now i'm confused

jug: here i started to reach 'C', not immediately, but in the long term, otherwise it would be too obvious (as we see later). Even if it was luck or bad reading by W, i tried. Could have been easily avoided by W playing at 'B', but W didn't ;)

alaric: B and C here area maia (of equal importance such that white does not need to play either because if black takes one white gets the other), so your stone threatens very little.  A move that require your opponent to make a mistake is generally not worth playing, you should be making your moves presuming he will play the best possible next stone.  You and your opponent have left the bottom left alone for quite some time.  t looks like you have the disadvantage in the coming fight, but even if you can't win the corner you should at least be able to get quite a few points in sente while playing there.  The defense against the monkey jump (if you don't know what a monkey jump is learn it now, it's very simple and can turn a game around at times) at O18 is starting to look good.]
;W[mh];B[lg];W[nn];B[mo]SQ[on]C[alaric: Not good.  White pushing in at P6 is worth much more than the 2 points you get (in gote) by protecting N6.]
;W[np]C[jug: oh no, how can i stop W from invading to the SE-corner without losing troups ... I'm too weak in this area and W has this strong wall.]
;B[oo];W[nr]C[jug: there it comes, now what

alaric:  This was well played by white.  At this point you try to staunch the bleeding, and get a wall with as much territory as possible.  I think P2 is probably your best best (although you may have to sacrifice the P2 stone you'll get a wall without white breaking through).]
;B[oq]C[alaric: Not good.  Do not try to save single stones.  You should sacrifice single stones (and even small groups) as soon as they become a liability.  White is into the corner now and your losing alot of points.]

[dr:A]SQ[dn][do][eo]C[jug: 'B' would have been better !?, also see move 216

alaric: A doesn't serve much of a purpose here.  I think you are going to lose the corner at this point, probably better to try to exact a price because of it.  The marked group is low on liberties.  By attacking it I think you gain a decent amount of territory, but extending to B first gives your group enough liberties to be potentially dangerous.]
;B[dr]C[jug [30k?\]: oh, that was so sad
jug: ... but i could have done more (see ...)
me thinks this move poor choice, B4 would have been better (giving more liberties instead of losing), but i also didn't wanted to loose the SW-corner completly.

alaric: This is a thank-you move (ie white thanks you for playing it).  You are forcing white to address a weakness in his lines, and you gain very little because of it.]
;W[dq];B[bp];W[bo]LB[cn:A][bq:B]TR[bp][cp][dp][ep]SQ[co]C[jug: here i thought my stones (triangles) are lost, and i wanted to limit the damage by plaing at 'A'. I've read out, that there is no hope to save that group.
A replay with GnuGo offered 'B' as next move. Did i give up too early ? Solving L&D-problems is good practice, but those never occur in your games ;)

I tried playing at 'B' trying to avoid the kill of my group, but i'm not sure where the best play for W when playing that kill out till the last move. I tried several variations (not included in this sgf), but found no solution ...

If there isn't, at which move would it been possible ?

alaric: A is not good since it forces white to connect, and to decrease your liberties by one.  I studied this a good bit and think your best bet is to push at C5.  This leads to some complicated battles, but it looks like you have a decent shot of saving the group and gaining quite a bit of territory.]

LB[lm:B][qs:A]SQ[bb][nb][is]C[jug: played at 'A' to slowly proceed with my plan to cut at 'B' (as told before). But move at 'A' seems "small". Better play ?

alaric:  You are in the end game, so you play Death by 1000 cuts.  You want to play as many sente moves as you can get away with, and end with any big gote moves remaining.  Because A is sente (fairly strong sente at that) it is a good move.  Other valuable moves are O18, B18, and J1.]

(;B[la];W[mb]LB[lb:A][mc:B]C[jug [30k?\]: how can you avoid that ? ahhhhhh

jug: maybe at 'B', but what outcome is better according to points (don't know how to count yet):
- 'A' (how it went on seems to be the best to me),
- 'B' (see variation),
- variant 'C' in move 242, or
- variant 'B' in move 240

After all, how the game was played was the best outcome for W IMHO. Right !?

alaric: Yes, how this was played was very favorable for white, B would have  been better.]

(;B[lb];W[mc]LB[md:A][nd:B]TR[nb][nc]C[jug [30k?\]: hm, now my stones on O17/18 (triangles) are dead, or what ?

jug: when reading out W play on 'B' in my review, i surprised me with some situations and their "lesson".

@reviewer: can you please follow and calculate points for every outlined path of variation 'B' or correct it, when any is wrong or you found a better outcome. In particular compared to main paths outcome at move 273. I would also appreciate your opinion on those paths.

 alaric: It's not quite fair to judge some of these paths because they capture/defend the marked stones.  Since these stones have been vulnerable for a long time someone should already have played here.  This is worth 10 points in gote (for either side).  You should probably have played N2 before N7, even though it worked out well for you.  I gave comments throughout the variations where useful.]

[jh][kh][ji]SQ[il][im][jm][in]C[jug: must connect at 'A' before on 'B', which is a snapback (not seen during game, only in review).
Snapback is very difficult to see :(

alaric: You don't need to connect at either A or B.  The square marked stones L12 if white takes K11, the square marked stones can capture at K7 if white plays J6, and the circle marked stones can play at E8 if white plays at A, or D8 if white plays at E8.  All of the stones in this area are safe so you don't have to react to whites move.  Just fine the best move to make.  Currently it looks like K7 is your best move, it's worth 2 points in sente.]

I was fairly sure, that B would win now, but I wanted a more or less "even" game/result.
@reviewer: your opinion about that ?

alaric: Punish away, you tend to learn more from a mistake than from a good move.  On online games I only undo or give undo's for misclicks, not for mistakes in reading.  When you allow undo's for mistakes of logic you reinforce bad behavior, you need to fully think through a move before making it.]

At move 209, i thought B is much better than the normal or average 30k-player on KGS. Never having played a 19x19 game seems odd to me with B's feeling for influence and threating moves. And also later in the game (move 258 and move 283) B foreshadow something as "I should teach you instead".
I had occurences with high ranked players pretending to be weak and making fun of you or feel good at slaughtering newbies.
But on the other side this was no slaughter game, only much pressure, and maybe i AM a weaker beginner.

@reviewer: what do you think ? you may send an answer to that last note of myself to my email instead of including it here in the review.

@reviewer: opinion, final evaluation about the game, my (sometimes twisted) playing logic or moving, how to improve next, etc

alaric: At the beginner levels (until you get around 20k) the ranks are very nebulous, and this is especially true of 30k's.  At this point most people have some natural skills they are better at, and a couple of areas they have studied more than others.  Winning is dependant on if the style of play fits into your strong points, and who makes the fewest mistakes.  You seem to think your opponent is better than you, but you won.  Whites problem seems to be that he leaves weakness around, and doesn't properly read how dangerous they are.  You gave him an undo or the final would have been even more in your favor. 

As for what to study next, I don't see a whole lot of specific problems with your gameplay.  To me, both you and your opponent look higher than 30k, but again it's hard to judge at this level.  Review your play on the top, and the group that resulted.  You had quite a few weaknesses in that formation that would have made me very nervous.  Other than that I can give you a standard set of skills you'll want to work on.  First, life and death problems.  Simple mistakes like losing sente because of playing an unnecessary stone (ie T18), can cost you dearly.  You can get a beginners life and death problem book to work out of.  There is also goproblems.com, although they problems (even the ones marked easy) are quite difficult.  Secondly I'd suggest studying joseki.  The unorthodox approach to the top left corner, and the 3-3 invasion in the top right both seem to indicate that you haven't studied joseki much.  Do a search for Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, it's a free SGF dictionary, and is quite useful.  Study the 4-4 joseki extensively, especially the knights move approach, and the 3-3 invasion.  Memorizing the different paths has some value, but trying to understand why these paths are joseki is more important.  3rd you should study some fuseki (opening game theory).  Fuseki gets very complicated, but some of the concepts are good to learn, even for beginners.

My last remaining piece of advice is the go proverb "Lose your first 100 games quickly".  Simply, the best way to learn is to play, and winning or losing shouldn't be the goal, learning is.  Do not put alot of value in 9x9 games, or computer games.  Both are quick ways to play lots of games, but aren't not nearly as valuable.  I spent alot of time when I was first learning the game playing 9x9 games against a computer.  When I started playing 19x19 games what I had learned previously didn't help very much.  Also, computer games don't play like human opponents.  The skills you learn will help you play better against computers, but they aren't as useful when you play versus another human.  After you finish a game, review it if possible, if it's by yourself, with the other player, with a higher level player, or through GTL, by whatever means you have available.  I also found it quite useful to download games from GTL that are a couple of levels higher than you are and go over them.]

I must admit that surprises me a lot, the trap i set off could easily be the one i step into.

alaric: The marked stones are dead already, they can only get one eye, and can't capture anything to survive.  This just underscores the importance of reading out your moves, even in the end game when it looks simple.  I've lost a game by making a 50 point mistake in the last 3 moves of the game.]
