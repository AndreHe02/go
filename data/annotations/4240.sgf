C[Hi, I'm a german 1kyu not 3kyu anymore :) but my english is not so good that's why i want to apologize before. Also i will focus my comments on the mistakes of white and will not comment Black's moves. That's my first review that's why there will be maybe some missunderstandings if so please send me a message. OK let's start ^.^]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]C[playable 
Hint: It really helps to watch the first 5-10 moves in a pro-game to know how to respond in this or that situation.]
;B[qk]CR[nc][jd][jp][mp]SQ[de][po][qo]C[Black played a chinese opening. Now there are several good points.
o = good points
[\] = bad points]
(;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[Mistake of black];W[qn];B[qp]C[o6 is a rare seen Move but in this situation it would be the best.]

(;W[pn]C[Too heavy. You're right an approach on the other side would've been better.]
;B[nq];W[pj]C[It's better to run away, because q10 doesn't help the group on q6. IT creates another weak group which has to run.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[oj];B[pm];W[no];B[ml]C[Th];W[lp]C[The one point jump would be better.]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[np];W[nn];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[nm];B[nl];W[lm]
;B[kq];W[ll];B[lk];W[jm];B[mj];W[qf];B[qh];W[of]C[well done because answeing at q12 be very bad for white.]
;B[qj];W[ph];B[pg];W[qg];B[pi];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni];B[qi];W[nh]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[nj]LB[mc:A][nc:C][md:B]C[I wanted to attack the top right stones now because I'm really far behind.  I thought of moves A,B, or C, but I thought that black can easily break out into the center or make life in the corner, so I decided to invade at 3-3]
;W[qc]C[To invade in 3-3 is a very interesting idea and looks like a good move in this situation. Another possibility would be o16 because you get nice thickness and also have some aji left in the corner.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pb]C[Of course later there is a monkey jump but the corner is now the biggest around and also defends the cutting point. Also there is a nice Tesuji on the bottom later on. Attention: don't play this in the mid-game but in the end-game.]

(;W[rg];B[md]C[black would've been better on m17 to use the wall.]
;W[jc]C[This move is more urgent than a shimari and also there are nice followups e.g. n18]
;B[ke];W[ie]C[now it's better to make a high-shimari immediately because the black group is not strong enough to attack k17.]

It was a really nice game (you are the first game that i review on GTL) to review. I'm terribly sorry that it took such a long time but I hope it will help you a bit. Finally if there are any questions you can send me an e-mail (bastiengels@yahoo.de) but please write in the topic that you're from GTL otherwise I will not open it.
