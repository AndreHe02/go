C[Hello, in this review i want to focus on the fight at the midgame and how i should have to handle it. I ended winning the game but because a mistake of my opponent, if he didn't made the mistake he should have won the game easy, because of my poor performance in the fight. Let's start]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[cf];B[fq]C[i tried to approach from this side to try to make my stone work with the two that i already have in the bottom right corner]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[go];W[eq];B[gq]C[Kirsten: This shape is too good for W.  You should stick to the Joseki.]

(;W[cj]C[Kirsten: this is a weak move by W];B[fn]C[I think hitting the head of the 2 stones is very good here because you are reducing the opponent framework while increasing yours

Kirsten: correct. W should not have let you.];W[en]
(;B[fm];W[em];B[fl];W[dk]
(;B[qj]C[Probably a bit slow, i'm trying to create a large moyo with this stone, if not responded i'll follow with a stone at P10

Kirsten: for creating a Moyo, better use the fourth line. This one can be reduced very easily by a shoulder hit.]

(;W[kq]C[And then an invasion, i never know how to deal with them.

Kirsten: I think this is an overplay by W.]
(;B[lp]C[Kirsten: I think your mistake is, that you want to kill it. Let him live small on the lower side.

Your shoulder hit is still ok. With it, you can focus on making territory on the right side.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mq]TR[mp]C[Kirsten: you create an unnecessary cut. This move tells you want to kill W. Let him live and be happy.]
;W[kp];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[nl]C[Kirsten: This is an overplay again. Now W has two problems.]
;B[kn]C[Kirsten: Very good.];W[hq]
(;B[hr];W[iq];B[ir]C[Kirsten: If you are really sure that these moves kill W, then they are fine. Otherwise it's better to attack from the top, close W in, and see later, if you may kill him. The problem is, when you attack from the bottom, and W doesn't get killed, you made im walk into your territory/mojo.]
;W[jr]
(;B[lr];W[kr];B[mr];W[io]C[So at this point, i think i'm in a good position, but i didn't know how to manage well the situation]

(;B[jn];W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[gn];W[hm]C[Kirsten: Now it's getting ugly for you. It is because you were focused too much on killing, now you get a weak group on your own.]

;B[kl];W[lm];B[jj];W[mp];B[mo];W[np];B[no];W[op];B[oo];W[pp]
;B[pq];W[po];B[nm];W[ml];B[pn]C[An things started to look ugly from my point of view, from a group that was almost dead to a race for the life of the sealed group

Kirsten: correct.];W[qo];B[qn];W[ro];B[rn];W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[Kirsten: this move doesn't make any sense...];W[rq]
;B[nq];W[sp];B[qr]C[terrible moves that ends with life for his running group... how i should have attacked the running group?]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[qs];B[ps];W[ls];B[rs];W[sr];B[jo];W[jp];B[hp]
;W[ms];B[ns];W[or];B[ks];W[ls];B[ip];W[ss];B[jq];W[iq];B[ms]
;W[js]C[Double Ko, so i think my bottom group is alive

Kirsten: correct.];B[is];W[ls];B[hq];W[qs];B[ks];W[kk];B[jk]
;W[ls];B[rs];W[os];B[ks];W[on];B[om];W[ol];B[pl];W[ni];B[oj]
C[Don't know how attack the group well, but this stone also wants to build a moyo on the upper right side of the board

Kirsten: well, this stone doesn't build a moyo, it's just an attack.]
;W[nj];B[pg]C[Kirsten: but it looks fine.];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]
(;W[sb]C[I don't know if this stone played by my opponent is necessary but i got sente so it's fine

Kirsten: yeah, it's no necessary, you may capture 2 stones in the endgame]

(;B[jd]C[At this point i tought, well i'm doing good, i can still create a large moyo in this area

Kirsten: but now you have a group to attack, that's more important. It really should be dead. You cannot create a mojo, when your opponent is already inside.]
;W[hc];B[mg]C[Kirsten: good. W did not have the time for H17. But you gave him a chance to rescure his group with K16.]
;W[li]
(;B[kg];W[ji]C[Kirsten: good tesuji by W.]
(;B[kj]C[Kirsten: this move helps only W.];W[ki];B[ii];W[jg]
;B[jf];W[ih];B[hh];W[hg]C[And the group ran away... as well as the game

Kirsten: yes... the problem was, that you often pushed your opponent in the wrong direction. Try to think first of keeping him in, not let him do a mojo walk. If he lives, ok, you will have made profit on the outside. Maybe you can still kill him. But then it's a fight where you have nothing to lose. If you attack from the wrong side, with the only intention to kill, you lose profit, if you don't succeed.

Have you read Attack and Defense? If you did, read it again. It will give you the right ideas.
