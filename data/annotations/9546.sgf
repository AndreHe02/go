C[played on playok.com sept 3 2014. white (me) was ahead at the end but black won on time. I am 4kyu on kgs and my opponent here was about the same rating as me on playok.com

I seem to be 2dan on KGS, let us see if that means that I can offer you some useful insights into your play]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[pc];B[qe];W[co];B[fp];W[qn];B[nc]LB[ql:A]
C[This is an unusual choice of double approach by your opponent, I suppose A might be more normal.
We cannot say this move is bad though.];W[nq];B[pn];W[pm];B[on]
;W[qo]LB[qp:A]C[Black normally blocks at A now];B[oq]C[not a joseki move]

(;W[qq]LB[qp:A]C[opening moves ok?

This looks reasonable so far, you are ahead];B[qp];W[rp]
(;B[pq];W[rr];B[qr];W[rq];B[pr]LB[jq:A]C[i think black's move was too slow

Indeed, black should not answer here. Something around A to kill the aji with the Q5 cut seems better to me. I cannot say with complete precision what the best spot is.]

(;W[qg]LB[nd:B][np:A]C[instead should i rescue my o3 stone??

I do not like your move, since you seal yourself into the corner.
A or B would be my choices];B[lo]SQ[po][np][kq]C[Black's move does not resolve the weaknesses in the lower side, therefore it is a mistake]

(;W[qd]C[instead should i separate black

Yes you should, as you can see from what happened in the game]
;B[pe];W[lc];B[od];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[qf];W[fd]LB[fd:B][dk:A]
SQ[qg]C[perhaps d8 more vital

The marked stone is now weakened, even if you got a move on the left side in sente.
I would probably prefer A to your B, but there looks to be a small difference
Since the left side is wider than the top, it should have more potential, so it should be preferred]
;B[hc];W[dj]SQ[co]C[Not really a shape. The left side still has many gaps in which Black can invade.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ee];W[gc];B[hb]C[looks bad to me?

Yes, Black should ascend instead of this descend];W[hd]C[now black is split]
;B[id]
(;W[ie]LB[he:A]C[A looks to be much better
Here you create a problem that you have to go back to fix later.]
;B[jd]
(;W[jb]LB[he:A]SQ[pc][qd][rd][re]C[good or bad?

If the group in the corner didn't exist, then I would like this move
I think it is more important to fix this weakness at A.];B[kc]
;W[kb];B[jc];W[ib];B[ic];W[le];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[ig]LB[kb:A]
[jd:C][cf:D][ig:B]C[instead have i time to attack left by d13 perhaps?

The situation is complex now.

A is not alive
If you did not play B then your opponent surely would jump at the chance of this hane. So I think you had to play it.

You want to have the chance to kill either C or D - but will you get to?]
;B[eg]LB[lb:B][jd:A][ld:C]C[This looks too greedy.

since A is not settled yet, Black needs to help it go out - perhaps this C / B combination to connect is a good choice for Black]

(;W[lg]C[perhaps n18 instead to live

N18 is definitely an alternative];B[ld]
(;W[md]C[i think n17 would work better

I am not convinced.];B[lb];W[kd];B[mb];W[dh]C[so now i've lost k18 but they might have some aji if blacks outside liberties are reduced

I don't think that the 3 white stones will be useful now. But D12 is a good move, attacking Black]
;B[fh];W[gi]C[trying to attack but technique is just guessing!

Seems fine to me.You'd need to be 7d to know the correct point]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[ei];W[ej];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[cg];W[bi]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[gj];B[he];W[gd];B[gf];W[gb];B[ia]
(;W[hj]LB[ii:B][hj:A][kq:C]SQ[oo][po][np][op]C[i decide that black is alive so my j14 group is no longer useful? or would k13 be better?
OR how about a ladder breaker around L6 toreduce black's bottom territory? or capture h11?

It is a good moment to consider your options.
Instead of A, B seems viable and good, controlling the centre

C is not impossible, we would need to count how much territory Black can expect to take with a move on the lower side - then we can see if B is less urgent.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[lj]CR[ie][if][ig][hh]C[guessing the spot but i had designs on making the right hand side my territory.

I do not really understand this plan. Is the idea to force your opponent to capture the marked stones, then take points on the right/?]
;B[jg]C[It looks big to surrender these stones];W[kh];B[jj]
LB[jh:A]C[Black should correct directly at A to eliminate White forcing moves]
;W[fn]LB[pj:A]C[looked important to prevent big black moyo but maybe right hand side is more urgent??

I think that this is bigger than some sort of loose move like A]
;B[bp]LB[iq:A]C[A looks more correct to me];W[cp]LB[qj:B][kq:A]
C[I do not believe that White absolutely must answer B4

The invasion of A looks very big, and if you end in sente, B looks like the next biggest point]
;B[cq];W[bo];B[ok]LB[kq:A]C[i think black was correct - now i'm cut off.but can i win by taking some right hand side, saccing the middle and reducing the bottom?

The invasion at A is still very large. It is beyond my level to say absolutely, but I do not believe that Black can kill the centre with just 1 more move.]
;W[ho]C[here i go - technique??

Again, I would invade directly. Technically, you are leaving too many cutting points, but this has a beneficial side effect]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[go];W[hq]C[correct, now the bad technique has allowed you to invade :)]
;B[gp]LB[lq:A]C[now White can play at A in my opinion, erasing a lot of black territory]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[gm];B[io]C[This move is difficult to handle]
;W[in];B[jo];W[jp];B[jn]LB[jn:A][kp:B]C[Instead of A, Black should surely turn at B, to keep hold of his own territory
This is a big mistake in my opinion];W[lp];B[lq]C[interesting try]
;W[kq]C[all this seemed highly dubious by both of us. need some pointers.]
;B[mp];W[kp];B[mq];W[ko];B[jm];W[mo]C[I do not really understand why you do not atari on the other side]

(;B[kj];W[gq]C[i think it worked out well for me if i lived here - could he have done better?

Yes :)];B[fq];W[jr];B[ir]C[this placement doesn't work, as we see in the game, therefore black loses points]
;W[hr];B[is];W[lr];B[mr];W[ks];B[fr];W[iq];B[gr];W[hs]LB[nj:A]
[pk:B]C[This is a small mistake, since White is alive there, you should probably try something like A to live 
It seems that White is far ahead now.
B if you do not think the middle can live];B[ap]LB[qk:B][bq:A]
C[bad move?if he plays r9 say  and captures middle he could win but he's given away sente

A is the correct shape locally
You are right that B certainly looks better globally]
(;W[pj];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj];W[qi]C[possibly dangerous because he can separate me and all i needed was part of the side i think. however my group can live on its own i think with s13]

(;B[ql];W[rj]
(;B[pl]C[bad move by black? r8 now should win comfortably but i ran out of time

Yes. You made fewer mistakes than your opponent did, so it is no surprise that you should win - even if you did lose by time :) Hope I managed to notice something you might find useful in the future.]
