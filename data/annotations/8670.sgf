C[Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1 (not solid 10k on KGS)

It was a friendly game and i was trying to do my best, but still lose it.

I would like to know which mistakes i have done in the beginning of the game (fuseki mistakes, direction of play, forms).
Another thing i would like to know what i should do with "moyo reduction moves" in the top of the board in tuban (i feel that there were too much mistakes and black could protect moyo better)

There is some comments in the game tree with my thoughts about situation

Thanks for your time and sorry for my awfull english :)

Kurato1 [10k\]: have fun

--- Hi Kurato.

This is Vinyoo. I will be reviewing your game. Overall, I think the reason you fell behind is due to the combination of several moves:

1) The mistake on the upper-right to allow white secure big territory and gain huge influence.
2) The wrong direction to attack the invading stone (move 60) to your moyo.
3) The fighting on the lower side and on the last reduction move by white has gone to white's advantage.

You finally gain a lot of points back by killing lower-right white group.

If you read English Go book, I recommend "Attack and Defence" by Ishida Akira and "Opening Theory Made Easy" by Otake Hideo to improve the direction of play.

No matter of your level, you can improve your Go by studying a lot of life-and-death problems.

Hopefully, this review would be useful to you.

Vinyoo];B[cp]C[ORBix [8k\]: gg];W[pp];B[pd];W[dc];B[np]C[--- Normally, the approach would be at O3 instead of O4.

The 4th-line approach at O4 is not common. Since your stone at C4 is already high (4th line), you should approach at the low (3rd line) to find a nice balance.

Alternatively, you can also consider closing your corner at E3]
;W[kp]
(;B[pn]C[here i don't know how to play

--- I think this is OK. It prevents white from playing Q6 in the next move, which would be bad for black.since white would be safe on both sides.]
;W[oo]
(;B[no]C[--- I don't think this is a good move. Black cannot seal white in, he should play at R3 to get the corner instead.]
;W[oq];B[on]C[I feel it is not a best choise, too heavy

--- I think white should play O3 after this. Otherwise, black may be able to seal white in]
(;W[eq]
(;B[ep];W[fp];B[eo];W[dq];B[cq];W[gn];B[em]C[im not sure here, would c7-c8 be better?

--- Normally C6 is standard. Or you can leave this corner and play other points.

Lower right corner looks more urgent to me. Maybe O3. See variation.]
;W[ce];B[jc];W[cj];B[cl];W[ej]
(;B[dg]TR[ec][cd]C[g17 instead?

--- Yes, I think G17 is better. 

White right side looks flat. C10-E10 would be good if the corner enclosure is facing the different direction (should be E17-C16 instead).

Therefore, the next extension for white would be H17. So, you can play G17 first to spoil his structure.]
;W[gc]C[--- Should be E15 first for white.]
(;B[ee]C[--- This move can be dangerous. You should always check what would happen if white cuts you with brute force.

In this case, white surrounding is much stronger than black. It is hard to find a good response.

Just jumping with F13 is OK. You can find a way to isolate white C10 group later on. See variation]
(;W[gf]C[--- A bit thin for white. G15 is the better jump to keep connection with G15.

Cutting at D14 is still the best for white. See variation];B[fg]
;W[ef]C[---- I think it is a bit too early for white to cut

Black should play E13 instead. See variation]

;B[ci];W[ei];B[bg];W[de]C[--- It looks like white ends up with better position than black in this sequence.

Black only captures one stone at C10, but white has secured the top territory and grown very strong facing the middle.

In the beginning, it is more important to got stones facing outside.]

;W[kh]C[I don't know how to respond even now

here i feel i lose lots of points.

--- It is a bit difficult to kill this white stone here because white is strong on both left and bottom side.

Your move is conservative, which may be OK. 

However, the move around J12, trying to cut off white, might get you more points. Though, it starts a complicated fight.]
