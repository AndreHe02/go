Hello,
I'm playing black here. Thanks for the review!];B[pd];W[dp]

[fe:4][ge:5][ch:A][ci:B][cj:C][ck:D][cl:E]C[###- This extension is slightly too far.  The general rule for extentsion from a wall is  n+1.  That is the number of stones in the wall plus one should be the number of spaces inbtween the stones.

So if you have one stone, you extend to A
Two stones to B
Three stones to C and so on

You can also extend on the 4th line in this manner.  

This rule doesn't always apply, it's just a general rule of thumb.

So here, you should have extended to B.  Extending as far as you did leaves to much room for invasion.]
;W[cl];B[cn];W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck]C[### Please also see variation, it is possible to play either way]

(;W[el];B[bl]C[### Yes

Good result for b?];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[jq];B[hq]C[### It is to soon to invade, and this invasion is to deep.  Most of the time, it's better to build then invade, q10 being an example of this.  

The concept being that white will gain to much from attacking this stone, either in thickness or territory.   If you abandon the stone, and it gets captured, or you cannot make use of it's aji, it's more then one point because each move "gains" something.  Some people call it loosing a tempo.  So not only does you opponet get one point, you loose a tempo, or a chance to gain something.  If that doesn't make much sense let me know and I'll try and explain it better.

White could have punished you far worse, see variations]
(;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[eq]C[### If you are trying to make life, this appears to be the move

Is there a better move to make live quickly?];W[dq];B[ep];W[eo]
;B[iq];W[ip];B[er];W[dr];B[jr];W[kq];B[nq];W[lr]C[### white didn't make you suffer to bad, but white still has territory + thickness while black only has territory]
;B[nr];W[jc];B[nc];W[lb]C[### to small of a move for white]
;B[qj]C[### Good idea, but the 4th line might be better as white has a lot of influence]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[dg];B[cg];W[di]C[### Yes, white is getting thicker but it's not a perfect seal

I felt a bit like being sealed in.];B[dj];W[ej];B[dd];W[cc]
;B[fe]C[###This is very good, you don't let yourself get sealed in all the way]
;W[ge];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg];W[gi];B[fh];W[kl]C[### This white move is to small]

;W[pg]C[### This is a strong move by white, try to figure out why? See 68 for answer]
;B[qf];W[qg]C[### it's good because it splits the groups, reducing your moyo greatly.  White has many options for running now, also important.]

I would suggest www.goproblems.com
Try solving all of there end game problems 
Then start working on Life and death

All and all you seem to be off to a good start in the go world, with serveral very stong moves in this game you show you are certianly moving in the right direction.]
