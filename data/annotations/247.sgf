[lq];B[qq];W[oq]C[dada: Maybe a bit too early.];B[or];W[np];B[mq];W[mp]
;B[gq];W[lr];B[ns];W[iq]L[lp]C[dada:  Wrong direction? w#18 is too close to your own stones. Maybe playing from the  other side is better, but your wall isn't strong, because of the possible cut  at 'a' (m4).]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[cm];B[bq];W[bp];B[dq];W[cp];B[ar];W[de]C[dada: Good.]
;B[ee];W[dd];B[ed];W[cc];B[df];W[ec];B[fc];W[db];B[ff]C[dada: b  traded territory for influence - good.]
;W[kc];B[ic]M[ff][ee][df][ed][fc]L[mc]C[dada:  Wrong direction. The marked stones are strong. Proverb: 'Play away from  thickness (your own, and that from the opponent).' Thickness is best used in  a fight. Not necessarily in making territory. If b attacks around 'a' (n17)  it would serve t
wo purposes: driving w against b's thickness and making territory in the  upper right corner while attacking.]
;W[nc]C[dada: w gets a nice extension];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[qh]L[ph][ch]
[cf]M[nd][pn]C[dada: Right idea, but I would have played on the fourth  line at 'a' (q12), which would've worked better with the two marked w stones.  Or you could have played at the left side at 'b' (c12) with a good follow up  at 'c' (c14).]
;B[qg];W[qj]L[ph]M[nd][nc][kc]C[dada: hmm. How about 'a' (q12) instead? It would help your marked group,  which isn't fully alive yet. And relate better to your wall at the lower part  of the board, which is directed torwards the center (not torwards the edge).]
;B[ro];W[rn]C[dada: not urgent.  Take sente to play either on the left or to develop the center.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[ob]C[dada: This isn't urgent. Left side is important  now.]
;W[ph]C[dada: Good.];B[mk]C[dada: I don't like this move.  It's too far in w's sphere of influence. Attack the w group at the upper  edge, not to kill the group, but to gain thickness. Then turn to the center,  with your thickness backing up a move like this.]
;W[mm]L[mh]C[dada: wrong  direction. A move around 'a' (n12) would serve three purposes - cut of the b  stone, help your group on the upper side and maybe b can be shut in the  corner.]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[mi];W[ng]C[dada: Good];B[ho]C[dada: Left side is more important.]
;W[io];B[in];W[jo];B[hm];W[km]C[dada: Too small. Your  last chance to play on the left is gone now.]
;B[cf]C[dada: Finally.  Good.];W[kg]M[mk][ok][mi]C[dada: Good - puts pressure on the marked stones.]
