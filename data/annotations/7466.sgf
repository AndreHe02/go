C[Ladder game between White 1d KGS wojtek and 6k KGS dawid played in Szczecin Go Club
thx for reviving

[ZD\] I am going to start my comments with this mark.  According to KGS rank, I am not much stronger than the white player, so I will focus on black's play.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[pr];B[mp]LB[ip:A]
[mp:C][np:D][qq:B]C[[ZD\] This move seems strange.  Once white connects, A and B are miai, and the exchange of C for D strenghtens white a lot.]
;W[np];B[qq];W[jq];B[cd];W[ed];B[ec];W[dd]LB[ec:B][fc:A]C[[ZD\] This strategy (building a moyo in lower left) seems fine for white.  Answering B at A would also be good for white, as he would get a strong group and limit the black potential on right.  B seems to be a mistake, a pincer would be more natural.]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[cc]C[i'd choose the easiest way, i dont know josekis]
;W[fd];B[gc];W[di]LB[be:B][df:A][di:C]C[[ZD\] I would prefer playing at A for white.  In the game, black has a big endgame at B.  Potentially, he might also be able to play around A later, to split white, so white is not as thick.  Anyway, C seems playable as well.]
;B[hq]C[I think its good point

[ZD\] I don't think so.  if white answers as in the variation, black gets a weak group and helps white to close the corner.]

(;W[jo];B[eq]C[[ZD\] You are lucky, white let you get away with this overplay.]
;W[dq];B[ho]LB[co:A][ho:C][er:B]C[e4 seems to slow then i choose h5

[ZD\] e4 is very important.  If you play it, your group gets strong, while white has to protect against A, so you will get to play C anyway.  After your move, your group gets weak (white could also answer at  B to take away your base).]

;W[kq];B[ol];W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[qk]C[does r9 good?

[ZD\] I would play it differently (see the variation), but in general I agree with white-- he has no weak groups, so he can play agressively.]
;B[nl]LB[oj:A]C[[ZD\] White could ignore this and play e.g. A.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[mm];W[mn];B[oo];W[lm];B[ml]LB[ml:B][lm:A]
C[[ZD\] Exchanging A for B seems bad, as it strenghtens black.]
;W[nn];B[ll];W[pj];B[km]LB[ph:A]C[[ZD\] White needs to ignore this and play A.]

[mi:A]C[what about this exchange? (from 39 to 59)

[ZD\] It does not seem possible to close white in.  A looks tighter than B, but does not work, either.  It might be better to skip B and play C directly.]
;W[mi]
(;B[lj]LB[lh:A]C[[ZD\] This seems like a wrong direction, moving at A (away from your thickness) seems more natural.]
;W[lh];B[pf];W[mg]LB[kl:A]C[[ZD\] now white is OK, while you might run to problems with the cut at A later.]
;B[hj]C[it looks bad that i let white escape to the middle]

(;W[qi]LB[qc:B][pe:A][qe:C]C[[ZD\] This exchange is bad for white, he could play A, B or C instead.]
;B[qe];W[rh];B[dl]LB[md:A]C[i feel like d8 should be on the third line

[ZD\] I would play around A, instead.  It does not seem possible for white to make territory on left side in one turn, given the blacks influence.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[ck];B[dm];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]
(;B[gd]LB[jc:C][be:B][cf:A]C[[ZD\] This does not seem to do much.  Attacking the group at A would seem natural, playing endgame move at B or extending to C could also be considered.]

[ZD\] You made some mistakes in the beginning -- the attachment at A was a wrong direction, and ignoring B is rarely a good idea. Finally, you missed the chance to attack the C group.  Black made some mistakes as well (attempting to live in the upper right corner was unreasonable), but overall he was ahead most of the game.]

(;B[kc]LB[nf:A]C[[ZD\] Black now has ~15 points on top left, ~15 in top right corner, ~5 in bottom right, and ~5 points in the center, 40 in total.

White has ~10 on the bottom. ~10 in lower left, ~10 on right, and ~15 on the left, plus komi, more than 50 points.  The game seems difficult for black now; white has no weakness to exploit (cutting at A does not work).]
