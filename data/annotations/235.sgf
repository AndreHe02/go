;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op]C[Jared: Through white 12 the moves for  both players are flawless.]
;W[rq]C[Jared: Black 13 is a wasted  ko threat.  It also removes the possibility of peeping later at P2.  Look  up this joseki.  The only move here is N4 (followed by white  N2).]
;B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[mr];B[np];W[ns];B[mq];W[kd]C[Jared: White 20  is an odd approach move.  K16 is nicer  balance.  Later it will be easy for B to invade between D16 and L16.  L16  puts no pressure on Black moyo. o10, K16, and D10 are all big points.   o17 is also an excellent idea.]
;B[md]C[
 fwc 18k*: Starting observation.

Jared: N16-L16 good trade for black. o16 might have been better for black  21.  The one-space jump is seldom  bad.]
;W[nj];B[oh]C[Black 23 good choice.  P8 should  be rejected because territory has open skirt at  s3.]
;W[rd]C[Jared: White 24 is a special purpose move and is  horrible here.  It shows a lack of consistency on white's part.  The  o10-p12 trade is terrible if followed by s16.  Black should respond here  with r16, a move that is often good when white plays an isolated stone    on the second line under a fourth line stone.  Black can also play at  r15, r14, and r17, but probably r16 is best.  See variation.]

(;B[re]C[Jared: black 25 makes s16 look good.  White ends up  smelling like roses inthe aftermath of this  debacle.]
;W[qe]C[Jared: If you're going to play s15, you are  saying that you intend to sacrifice it.  See variation.]

(;B[rf];W[qd];B[pc];W[qf];B[rg]C[Jared:  Black 31 should be at r13];W[of]
;B[pg];W[oe]C[the trade of black 33-white 34 favors white.  Black 33 should be left  unplayed.]
;B[rb];W[me];B[ld];W[le];B[kf]C[Jared: black 39 is just  plain wrong.  It is unclear why it was played.  Did black have a plan?   Under many circumstances white would just play l15 and thank black for  forcing this trade.  Black 39 would look stupid after white played at  l15.  As it is, white seems to have an even better move at o16.  Black  can consider cutting at l15 with 39.  But it would seem that black must  defend the upper right corner.  However, this would give white sente,  which could be used to play c10 or s5, securing the win.  Black is bad  here.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[kc];B[mb]C[Jared: Black 43 good shape.];W[ke];B[mg]C[Jared: black  45 serves no purpose.  The white group on the upper right side is absolutely  safe.  Do not approach thickness.  Black is still thin around n13.  There are  a number of huge points on the board now.  white k14 would be huge now.]
;W[nl];B[fc]C[Jared: black 47 better at c14.  Force white  to play on  the upper side, duplicating force with the wall at l16.  The left side is  bigger than the upper side.  White should probably play the joseki  starting at e17, instead of the attach and extend joseki, which settles  black.  The white l15 group has nothing to fear and white will be able to  attack f17.]
;W[fd];B[ed]C[Jared: Black e16 is special  purpose.  Black must play joseki at g16.   Look it up.  Now we see why  c14 better than  f17.]
;W[ec];B[ee];W[dc];B[gc]C[Jared:  black has made a mistake at e16.  The best thing now is probably to block at  d15 with 53 then extend down the left side.  See also variation for white  h16.]

(;W[hd];B[hc]C[Jared: black 55 should be g16.  If  white plays g16 now the game is over.  see variation.]

(;W[id];B[gd]C[Jared: The ladder doesn't work.  white  should play f15.  Black will be split aprt.  The game will be  over.]
;W[jf];B[fe]C[Jared: black 59 good. simple,  resolves the situation.  No  aji.]
;W[cf];B[jg];W[ig];B[jh];W[hf]
(;B[pl]C[Jared: Black 65 is very bad.  The territory is  open,  as white can play s5 or t6, so q8 is not worth very many points.  Better  to attack the two weak white stones on a large scale (L8 looks  attractive).  Even if white lives, black will gain dominating center  influence to use for a right side invasion.  The white group on the upper  side is not completely alive yet either and an opportunity may arise to  attack.  Remember, the san-ren-sei is an attack opening.  Do not use it  to make territory unless your opopnent forces you  to.]
;W[kk]C[Jared: c6 is certainly bigger than s4.]
(;B[rp];W[ih]C[Jared: white 68 is small, almost  dame.  These groups are all alive.  Play a big point.  c6, for  example.]
;B[dg];W[df]C[Jared: white 70 should just  take territory with c13 and cement the win]
;B[cn]C[Jared:  Aha!  Black 71 a move in the right direction.

Note: I messed up the game record  here.  The game continues as in the  major variation.]
;W[fg]C[Jared: white 72 is ok, as it prevents  the breakout of  the black group on top.  Black should probably play j18 before g14 to  guarantee life.  See variation.  Black may have to give up the two stones  at n16, but 4 points are small.  Black should avoid strengthing white on  the outside as the left side is important.]

(;B[gf];W[ib];B[gg]C[Jared: The trade of  black 75-white 76 is awful for black.  White is going to get territory on  the left  side.]
;W[fh];B[eb];W[db];B[fa]
(;W[hb]C[Jared: White 80 should be left unplayed as it forces  black to live, and thus is aji keshi.  There appaers to be a ko with  white 80 at d19, for example. See previous variation.  But black has many  internal ko threats, so this should be left  unplayed.]
;B[gb];W[da];B[ea];W[he]C[Jared: white 84 is a wasted ko threat.  White is alive.  m18 is sente and  white can still go out to the center.]
;B[ge];W[cl];B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[ck]C[Jared: the shape  move for black 91 is probably  e6.]
;B[ek];W[cm];B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[ep];B[cp];W[en]C[Jared: black must  connect at 99.]
;B[cq];W[dn];B[co];W[gm]C[Jared: saving black's  four stones is going to be  tough.]

;W[gl];B[dh];W[ci]C[Jared: there is no reason for white to play 116.  At best it forces e11,  which would be good for black.  But black realizes the three e12 stones are  small.]
;B[gk]C[Jared: black 117 should be a connection at h9 and  black might just have a chance of escaping.]
