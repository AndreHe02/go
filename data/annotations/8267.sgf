C[E: I kept track of this by periodically taking pictures of the board.  Now I have recorded it into an SGF the next day, after the tournament.  I was a little surprised that I has won at the end,  I had not been counting, which I know that I need to start doing.  After I lost the upper left corner, and allow him to reduce my upper right frame woork, I though he might be ahead, but it was likley close.  I used about 45 minutes of my time, my opponent about 35 minutes.

B: You tend to think your opponent will "help" you in your analysis. Try to analyze more variations, and consult a joseki book or database, and pro games, to analyze the corners.
The game is entertainment, and it mainly shows that you should:
- read more, especially looking at your weak points (e.g. cuts)
- count at least a couple of times. I have outlined a method to count fast during a game, feel free to ask me if you do not understand it.
Regarding your opponent, he cares too much on the low sides (1st and 2nd lines), he is missing the big areas.

Best regards,

[pk:d]C[E: I was very uncertain of a good response.

B: There are joseki at (a) and (b), see variations. I like (c) too. (d) looks too far.]
(;B[pk]
(;W[nc]C[B: in your variation here (white R7), white is too passive, and wastes a move. In fact, white can get a good result if playing R7.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]C[B: I would not play right here. Black is ok on the right side, and white has left an important spot near L4. Of course, since Q9 is too far, black should protect R5 before.
At this point, anyway, things are not that bad.];W[jc];B[eq]
(;W[cm]LB[do:a][iq:b][jq:c]C[E: I did not expect that.

B: Not uncommon, there are joski following at (a), (b) and (c). But, since white wants to play near L3, probably (b) or (c) are inviting to a white pincer.]
(;B[cr]C[E: On hindsite, this looks too small.

B: I agree. D5, followed by an extension towards J4, would be better.]
;W[qb]
(;B[rk]TR[qq]C[E: To me this is not a usual response, but I wanted to strengthen the mrked stone as I was havin some misgivings about he original extension.  I though this move strengthens top and bottom.

B: You thought is ok, but no way the place! THe second line is too slow. You could strenghten at R9, but it is still too passive and slow. R10 would be a bit better, still protecting both R5 and R14, but still slow.
A much better way to play here is to force a response from white, e.g. by playing P5. Then you can turn to the top left corner.]
(;W[fc]C[B: good timing, thoug a bit low on the top side. I would probably choose attacking from the other side (see variation), or at F16 to oppose to the black influence from the right side.]
;B[hc]C[E: I seldom princer, but these two four point extenstion from one stone just seemed too week.]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[B: This one depends on the context, but it may overconcentrate black (H17 is too close)]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[cd]C[E: On hindsite, this looks awful.]
;W[bd];B[cf];W[ie]C[B: As you can see, black is overconcentrated and white is much more efficient.]
;B[ge];W[jq]C[B: A bit far, L3 or L4 would be better. But I think the direction of play is ok.]

[os]C[E: I wanted to be agressive, I was not certain about my opponent's fighting strength.

B: Let's count. A good fast method is counting only safe points, 1 for every 2 points for black. Then substract from 50, and count the same for white starting at the differenct. If over 50, white is ahead, else black is ahead (not considering komi).
Here we have 15 for black, start from 35 to count white and oyu will get to 48, accounting for komi this is too close. Influence looks quite even also.
So, I would say it is your choice :-)];W[nq]
(;B[lp]TR[lo]C[E: I think the marked space is better.  This feels too cautious.

B: Pros usually are cautious in this kind of context, especially if you are in a weak position locally. You move avoid the connection between N3 and K3, so it is locally the best one.
Please see your variation, there is a big mistake in what you think white would play.]
;W[eo]TR[gq]C[E: I got luckty that he played this instead of the marked space

B: Yes, I agree.];B[hq];W[ho]TR[io][jo]C[E: Again, I think a poor move compare with either of the marked spaces.

B: Yes. I think white was concerned with the black influence at the right.]
;B[ip];W[bg]C[B: Too slow. C12, Q6, or something around Q13 look possible.]
(;B[bf]C[E: This looks horrible.

B: again agree.];W[af];B[bh]C[E:  I though I was being tricky, but this is bad.]
;W[cg];B[ch]
(;W[dg]C[B: D14 first looks better, see variation.];B[df];W[ef]
;B[eg];W[dh]C[B: Probably a move atF15 would be better, but there are lots of variations to analyze.]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[eh];W[fd]
(;B[fe]TR[fb]C[E: I had several oppertunities to make, what I think is the right play (marked), but I completely missed it.

B: Yes, F18 is important, but the stones at J15 and K17 are in the right place to make things difficult.]
;W[de];B[hd];W[fb];B[di];W[ag]C[B: In these situations I usually prefer to eat (C15). It would avoid future ko threats, and provide a better fighting base (avoid damezumari).]
;B[ck];W[ci]C[B: This one would be a mistake, but white could have used it to play at E11 later.]

[bo][bn][qr][pq][pr][oq][or][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[B: Here we have a good moment to count, before deciding if defending, invading or reducing.
With komi, white is about 12 points ahead.
Influence is shared in the center, and there is a weak black connection at F13.
Can black get 12 points now?

He can get some points in S4 and B3, maybe 4 points each (white will probably answer), but a wonderful point to build more territory would be around M9. It makes the game even, though there is still some concern with the cut at F13.]
;B[me]
(;W[le];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]CR[pf][of][oe][ne][nf][qg][qh][qi]
[ph][pg][og][ng][pi][oh]MA[ke]C[E: this feel slike a very good result for me in the upper right.

B: too good. White should have ataried at N14 and then run away. See previous variation (move 82).
Considering the previous count, you got about 15 more points and white just 1. Even if he can reduce a bit, the game would be even now.]
(;W[lg]C[E: It hink I should have kept walking, but I didn't.

B: Yes, you had to, because every stone you put is worth about 4 points, while each white stons is worth nothing due to the wall at E-F. But you must be carefult with the cut!
As a rule, if you have this kind of configuration (3 in line with a stone cutting at O15) consider to add another one, to avoid white turning around N13.]
(;B[lh];W[mh];B[nh];W[mi];B[ng];W[kh]C[E: Score estimate is not perfect, but it calls this a 30 point swing in six moves.

B: If you consider my notes, it is worth about 12-14 points so far, so the game should be even.]
;B[jg];W[kg]C[B: Always better to eat the stone (e.g. to avoid black to buld a shicho at M9 and closing the M4-M9-Q9 area)]
;B[if];W[jf];B[ig];W[jd];B[gj];W[ni];B[oi];W[oh];B[og]
(;W[ph]C[B: Mistake, P10 better. Also, consider that if white would have got M12, he does not need to connect O 10 immediately (see variation).]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[pj];W[ai];B[cj];W[ak]C[B: Still too small, and black can just play A12, white must connect or play C15, and then black B8.]
(;B[aj]C[B: Not good. After white eats, black cannot cut a t A12. See variation.]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[al];B[bl];W[bm];B[aj];W[ok];B[ij]C[E: I feel is is bad form to use my (sort-ot) wall in the upper left to make territory rather than to attack a wek group white's, but I felt heavily behingd on territory.

B: As we saw before, you were not behind. But J10 can rescue M12.]
