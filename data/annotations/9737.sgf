C[Hi,

Thank you for review my play.
I felt pressured in this game. The opponent seems to know shapes better than I do.
When I play a certain move which generally I expect him to response in a particular way but most of the time he play a different kind of move, disrupting my flow.

I would like to know more about how I can improve on playing against opponent that does not generally play with the common shapes.

[pi]C[Instead of invading at A, try playing a reducing move around the boundery of black's moyo. Black is already strong, so invading is very likely to result in a weak group so black will most certainly gain points in the top right.]

(;W[ql]LB[nb:A][ob:B][qc:D][pd:C]C[Should I have attacked the upper right corner instead of this move?
I realize after this attack I help black to cover up his weakness in the upper right corner

I think it is a little too late now. Due to the exchange of A and B, black is much more strong. Attacking the corner would be much easier would you have played a probe earlier on, perhaps around C or D. See move 65]

See my comment at the beginning of the game and the variations. This group could be killed much earlier on. That's why it was important not to let your stones be cut.]

Ok, I think that the biggest mistakes were the sequences at the top when black invaded the corner and the cut on the left side. Also, the invasion at B is too deep, I would have tried to reduce around C. The corner territory for black is just too big.

I would suggest to study the variations. I think you can become a lot stronger when you : 

1. Try to keep your forces united.
2. Study tsumego, you could have saved the group at A!
3. Don't help your opponent as you did with the sequence around D
4. Avoid creating weak groups like E.

I hope you find this review helpfull, please let me know if you have further questions.]
