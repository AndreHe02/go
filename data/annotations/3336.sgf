;B[pp]C[Hello. I'm LoLo and I took white in this game. Thanks in advance to the reviewer, we all appreccate your efforts so we can learn a bit.
I'm primarily interested in the fuseki and yose stages of the game, any fighting advice you could provide will be appreciated too
I've gone through the game myself, and from now, ill mark my coments with *L*.
Thanks again and enjoy the game

Hi. I'm Hyoga and had black it seems :). Thx for for the review. I went through the game as well and marked my comments by "H".

Migeru: The game is not all that bad, but there are a number of large mistakes on both sides, and the game ended up being so close that it could have gone either way. You have some problems with timing, because on several occasions I suggest a move or sequence that you actually play out several moves later.]
;W[pd]LB[dd:A]C[Migeru: If White wants a mellow game he'll play at the opposite corner from Black. This is an invitation to a fighting game.]
;B[dd]LB[dp:A]C[Migeru: Black could say "thanks, but no, thanks" by playing at A. Taking opposing corners leads to a fighting game.]
;W[dp]C[Migeru: did white get what he wanted?]
(;B[dn]LB[cn:A]C[Migeru: It is more common to approach at A because it threatens to take away the corner.]

(;W[nq]LB[fp:B][nq:A]
(;B[qn]LB[jp:A]C[H : this doesn't protect the corner. What to play for that purpose?

Migeru: The point of R6 is not to protect the corner but to split it. See the variations. If you want to prevent White for making a lot of territory on the side you may want to consider a pincer at A instead.]

(;W[jp]LB[gp:A]C[*L* I played this to prevent a black pincer and extending along the bottom at the same time.

Migeru: This seems to work out ok for you, as you claim a lot of territory on the bottom edge. Black should now invade around A.]

(;B[ej]LB[ci:A]C[Migeru: Playing on the fifth line leaves enough room to allow an invasion. It is usually considered best to balance one's position between the 3rd and 4rd lines (for instance, at A)]
;W[qj]LB[dg:C][qg:B][qk:A]C[*L* Preventing black extension, but it seems to leave cutting points-counterpincer at Q or R13. Is this right ? perhaps r11 better ? is G4 urgent ?

Migeru: Black's ideal extension is at A, so your pincer is perfect. You are right that it invites an invasion, but if you play at, say, B then black will extend at A. Black is too high on the upper left side, and White should consider an invasion around C.]
;B[gc];W[co]C[*L* Covers F-G4 in sente ?

Migeru: I don't think so.];B[cn];W[fp]CR[bn][bo]C[Migeru: Never leave a high boundary unresolved like this: it will come back to haunt you (Black in this case)]
;B[fo]C[H : looks lik i'm starting a fight while some places are more urgent (K16 or D13 maybe? or even reinforce lower right corner?)

Migeru: Contact plays are defensive plays. If Black wants to fight, he should do it from a distance.]
;W[gp]C[Migeru: this looks like covering F-G4 in gote, not sente.]
;B[no]CR[bn][bo]C[H : too much orientated to the center, right?

Migeru: There are more points in the upper right, but you should have used your sente to attack at the marked points. A6 is sente, A5 is one point in gote. White A6 is one point in gote.]

(;W[mp]CR[gc][ej][fo]C[H: Now W has a huge moyo down there. Feels like F5 was a really bad move.

Migeru: No, White has territory on the lower edge and Black has a huge moyo delimited by the marked stones. It would seem that the right way to look at F5 is not as a way to reduce white's territory, but as a way to build your own moyo.]
;B[np];W[mq];B[oq];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[H: I really have more urgent places to play i guess...

Migeru: Maybe bigger, but not more urgent. You should leave plays on the 1st line for the endgame, but you should also not allow damaging plays on the 2nd line. You can't allow White to play Q2]

(;W[os]CR[nr]C[*L* Simple connection or tenuki is better ?

H: this is gote, right? You should leave that for end game maybe?

Migeru: Again, don't allow damaging plays on the second line. This means, White must play O2 (in gote).]
;B[ps];W[mr]
(;B[mm]CR[bn][bo]C[H: too early to expand to the center while the left side is not secured, I guess.

Migeru: There are more points to be made in the upper right than running to the centre. You should cover the marked points. See the variations.]
;W[bn]C[Migeru: A damaging play on the second line!];B[qf]LB[rd:B]
[bl:A]C[Migeru: This is very risky: a white play at A can be devastating for Black's moyo, but Black is threatening to steal the corner with B instead of defending.]
;W[nd]C[Migeru: White folds.];B[of]LB[rd:A][bl:B]C[H : R12 better?

Migeru: S16 better. You are trying to distract White from playing B, and do so in sente so you can come back and plug up at C. Or at least that's what you should be trying to do.]
;W[rl]LB[rh:A]C[*L* Trying to get a base for the weak stone and blow away blacks right moyo (if successful)

Migeru: I wonder if S12 wouldn't be better. Play away from strength!]
;B[pl];W[rh]LB[pi:A]C[H: now R14 has no base...

Migeru: ... but it can easily connect with A.];B[oj];W[ro]LB[rn:a]
C[*L* I think s6 is better. Was the jump at 3-3 point still possible ?

Migeru: You mean R3??? S6 is definitely better, because black at 'a' kills the white stone.]
;B[rn];W[sn]
(;B[qo]C[H: maybe T7 instead?

Migeru: Yes.];W[rp]
(;B[rq]C[Migeru: still T7];W[rm];B[qp]C[Migeru: with this, black has allowed S5 to become a good move, and sente, too!]
;W[kc]LB[bl:A]C[Migeru: I do think B8 is bigger.]
(;B[sp]C[H: I realise this leads nowhere I'm forcing W to gain strength here and i still need protection to the left side

Migeru: See the variation.];W[sm];B[so]C[Migeru: Gote!];W[cj]
LB[bl:A]C[*L* A mistake ?

H: C12 or C14 better for white? Or maybe C8 to threaten the connection?

Migeru: I think A is best. Your move is too deep and leads to a tradeoff, either a sacrifice to eat away a little territory arond B8 or living around C12 but giving up B6. If you played at A it would be an unqualified win for White.]

(;B[dl]LB[bm:A]C[*L* It seems to me too easy for white. b or c8 probably had been better ?

Migeru: This move is submissive. Play at A.];W[cl];B[ch];W[cc]
LB[di:B][bm:A]C[*L* I couldnt handle the upcoming sequence, is this invasion correct ? if so,  is this proper timing ? what's the correct sequence ? is there need of a white stone around c14 ?

Migeru: I think right now you have more important things to worry about. Black still has A. A white move at B is interesting too. However, you should be able to live.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[bd]C[H: E18 better for W usually no? but here I have G17 that helps.

Migeru: You said it all.];B[be];W[eb];B[fb]C[H: here i can play F18 instead of F17 thanks to G17]
;W[bb];B[db];W[cb];B[ea]LB[ac:A]
(;W[ce]C[Migeru: A17 lives. See the variations.];B[ad];W[ac]
;B[bc];W[de]C[*L* Trying to leave black with bad aji around f15, but it seems white will be shut in. J18 or L14 better ?]

;B[df];W[eg]
(;B[cf]LB[cf:A][fg:B]C[*L* A mistake for black ? that stones where captured. better f13 ?

H: I didn't realize the C16 group was copletely safe I think. Just didn't see it.]
;W[gg];B[eh];W[fh];B[dg];W[fg];B[ck]C[H: am i juste forcing W to strenghten here? B7 better to prevent connection (I need this territory from the looks of the board right now)? Invasion still possible in upper right corner also.

Migeru: I have been waiting for B7 for a long time.];W[bk];B[dk]

(;W[bl]LB[bl:A][cm:B];B[cm];W[re]C[*L* Protect the corner since isnt too much territory in the center and g15 group will probably live by running. Perhaps the open bottom was a chance ?

Migeru: The G15 group is alive by capturing F14.];B[bm];W[am]

(;B[do]LB[bo:B][do:A]C[H: see var];W[bp]C[H: now the variation is impossible. It was obvious that i wanted the double ko here... . I have a nice wall but i could have had much more territory on the left side.]
;B[qk]CR[id][jd]C[H: Maybe it's high time I tried to connect either left and bottom-right or bottom and upper right?

Migeru: No, what you need to do is prevent white from connecting his weak group in the upper-left with the upper-right. Play at the marked points.]
;W[rk];B[pj];W[qi];B[qh];W[rg]
(;B[qg]C[H : Q11 better?

Migeru: Not really. See variations];W[pi];B[oh];W[kf]C[*L* Prevent black of getting too much influence facing g15

Migeru: And making the white group around G13 live.];B[mg]C[H: K6 maybe is important right now?

Migeru: Yes.];W[kh]C[*L* Is the bottom bigger ? (k7 or so)

Migeru: Hard to tell.];B[kj];W[go];B[fn];W[gn];B[gm];W[jm]C[H : with WL12 and K7, i totally missed the opportunity to get central territory... Now i can only hope to connect both sides.

Migeru: you should have capped white at least on one of the top or bottom.]

(;B[km]LB[il:A]C[H: K8 better? H11? J17? Is there a possibility to invade the bottom?

Migeru: I think J8 would be better. For an invasion of the bottom, see the variations.]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[ko];B[im]LB[jl:A]C[Migeru: This leaves an ugly weakness at A.]
;W[in];B[jl]
(;W[jn]C[*L* Better to counteratari ? where ?

Migeru: See the variations.];B[hm];W[hj]C[*L* Erodes black moyo and get one of my own. can i be happy with the result ?

H: at least I can get _unhappy_ with it! :) I should have played that just before, or maybe one point up of that. But I could have been in trouble if W H7 maybe? Which one is more important?]
;B[gi];W[fi];B[gj];W[hi];B[fj];W[hl];B[jh];W[il];B[hh]C[H: trying to get some territory includin the two W groups of 2 stones.]
;W[hc];B[lf];W[kl];B[kg]C[H: is it better to save one of the two atari? If B K9, I can still hope to make that territory I spoke of earlier, right?]
;W[jg];B[lg];W[ji];B[ih];W[jj];B[lm]C[H: Now it looks terrible for B :)

Migeru: Yes, White is cleaning your clock.];W[kk];B[ki];W[jf]
;B[lk];W[le];B[hk]C[H :G8 better? I still need to connect at G12 maybe?
