AB[jj][pp][dd][pd][dp];W[nq];B[pn];W[jq];B[fq];W[pr];B[rq]C[r3 is better shape]
;W[qg];B[qj];W[rd];B[of]C[this move seems a bit vague to me.


If b wants to press on w's stones and build outward influence R15 is more
efficient. the alternative is to take the corner.];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[nb];B[oa]C[You asked wether this move is good or bad:





Cutting here gives you a weak group to attack, and thats just what you
want. If W doesnt want to abandon these two stones you can hunt them for
quite a while (as you did later) and gain a lot of influence/territory.


 You just have to watch out that your cutting group doesnt get cut off
itself.];W[me];B[ld];W[md];B[le];W[mf];B[oh];W[oe];B[pe];W[pf]

;B[ic]C[Playing on the fourth line (j16)  seems more logical here, since
you do not just want to make territory but rather do this whila attacking.
With a black stone at j16 w has no room to make an eye there]
;W[fc];B[fe]C[see move 11





although good for building up influende on the left side, e.g. g16 seems
more severe. this would be a splitting attack keeping the weak white group
and f17 apart. You can then turn to one of these two targets to continue
the attack.


(to be more precise the usual follow up after splitting two groups like
here is to play one or two moves against one of them to strengthen your own
position and then turn to the other one, usually the weaker one, to kill it
or at least to attack it more efficiently)];W[db];B[he]C[good move I think.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hd];W[ie];B[hf];W[ke]TR[ic]C[see comment at move 40:


with the marked stone at j1 instaed, w would not have an eye here.


So when attacking groups, tra to destroy potentioal eyespace (especially
if you can gain from the move yourself. j 1 would have done roughly the
same for b than j17 on the upper side)];B[kc];W[cc];B[cd];W[cf]
;B[df];W[ch];B[eh]C[d13 is sente and gives b a more solid shape.]
;W[ck];B[cm];W[cq];B[cp]C[this is the right side to block.]

;W[dl];B[dm];W[ao];B[bn];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[jh]C[another move you asked about; its another good move for it makes
w's eye a false eye. Otherwhise w's group would be settled with two eyes
mow, and you could not continue to attack.  The alternative would be k13,
but this move is better here.];W[ki];B[ji];W[lj];B[kl];W[ll]

;B[if];W[kd];B[kj];W[li];B[gc]C[So far b has one eye and a false eye. So why not keep up the
attack with O7? W can connect, but meanwhile b can gain territory.]

moves like d11and f8.];W[fj];B[gj];W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[hj];W[fm]

inturn at f6 and seal your territory.];W[fn];B[gn];W[fo];B[ep]
