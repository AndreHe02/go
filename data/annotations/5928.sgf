C[sai: Hi reviewer!. Thanks for commenting my game.
I play since, exactly, 1 month, and i know i have a lot to improve on, but i would like to see my huge mistakes, to work specially some days on them.
I add some questions, using "sai" as tag.
Thank you.
(this is a "semi" blitz)

hello
i like blitz and i believe it is good to play a lot of them when we start to gain experience
but it is a bit bad to expect to learn a lot from a review of a game that was played as a blitz, since you should be able to recognise yourself your main wistakes while it is good to learn from the mistakes you cannot see!]

So i would finish cut, there is a form with which i can connect using ogeima?, because i i really like it in the fuseki, rather than keima.
