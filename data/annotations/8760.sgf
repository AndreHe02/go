C[maybe is slow but i was guess to must protect my corner

C[i was think is better to around k17,is true?

krv: these points are near equal, but here natural points are E3 and M3,
 thus I'd prefer L16];B[jc];W[og]C[is a flash in this game,though i dont like moyo that move seems to tend their at the moyo,i want to say if my game curtains really to moyo]
;B[pg]C[heavy i think]

;B[oi];W[ni];B[oj];W[mj]C[krv: I don't see which purpose serves this move. May be N17 instead]
;B[ok]C[krv: last two white moves naturally hurts your right group - not sure if this is ok.]

;B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[ir];W[ch]C[this is the one of the intent because i play the sequenze in o11

krv: Here you just have creates big moyo in center, but this move may destroy it.]

krv: I like G8. May be E13 first.];B[il];W[gj]C[this was brave but i was not read to deep

krv: at this point E13 forces black to connect (I think). Later you can regret that you didn't play E13 before.]
