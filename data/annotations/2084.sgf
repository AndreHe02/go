C[Game reviewed 13 oct 2002 by Allan Wickberg, rank a little uncertain, possibly around 15k, so plaese keep that in mind when judging my comments, which are marked "al>".]
;B[cc]C[I
am playing black as Tobamf, Even though my rating says 30 k, I am about 26
k if you look at my rank graph and I played a 7 k who rated me at about 25
k.

Typical opening move

al> Playling 9x9, there is not much time outlining territory before the fighting begins. To me, this seems a little bit on the defensive side, but it is too early to tell yet.]
;W[ff]C[al> white is more aggressive, but instead leaves the corner open for invasion. Myself, I prefer the 3-4 points as a trade off.]
;B[ec]C[I think I could do a double
move and keep connected even if white tried to cut (Cho Chikum says you can),
but I have to play within my abilities and secure territory, even if it isn't
a lot.

al> This, I feel, is defnitely too defensive. There are still three corners open, and grabbing one of those seems a better option.]
;W[gc]C[al> Now white has outlined considerably more territory than black, even though black had the first move. However, the bottom right corner is still open, so nothing is settled yet.]
;B[de]C[now I have a really strong power center that I can use to invade when necessary

al> I can not judge the strenght of this position, but to me it feels a little too small. I think D4 would have given better shape, and more of an offensive towards the lower left corner.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[ef]C[I
think this stone will be saved because white will play e3 to save the D group,
so it's free territory

al> Maybe F5 would have been better. The C7-E7-D5-F5 would look nice as an indentation in the diagonal between the lower left and upper right corner.]
;W[eg];B[bh]C[now, on to defense, white can have e4 if I can gobble up c2 area]
;W[ci];B[bg]C[al> I don't think black has to do B3 right now. E5 or even F5 would push the border between black and white a little bit down towards the white area, and  pose more of a threat to the upper white corner.  9x9 is all about either pushing the border as hard as possible, or to infiltrate in order to invade or kill. There is very little time to secure territory, but rather to keep up the pressure on the opponent.]
;W[ee];B[bi]C[al> this is a forcing move, so in this case black does not lose tempo by securing territory. On the other hand, maybe it should be saved for use at a possible ko fight.]
;W[eh]C[durned! I wanted C group. But I expected this too.]
;B[dd]C[al> This, to me, is too defensive. Look at the diagonal between the lower left and upper right corner. B D6 gives white the chance to push the border into black's half of the board, while at the same time enforcing the border. It would be better to take a stab att the remaining weakness in white's position, around F6 and the upper right corner.

al>Black's weakness at C5 is serious, but it takes something more aggresive than D6 to do any seriuous damage to white at this point.]
;W[ed];B[fc];W[fd];B[ge]C[okay, this is the plan
I can force a few moves on white, which will nicely build me a bit of a wall.
If I can continue this wall, I can get 2 eyes and white will lose overall territory.

al> By now, it is almost impossible to invade white's territory. Playing G8 would be better, taking more of the corner, but white will still win by a point or so.]
;W[gd];B[he];W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[ie];W[fb];B[gf];W[gg]C[al> white should play at g2 or h2 instead, to kill the black group by not leaving it enough room to make two eyes. Contact play is for surviving, not for attacking.]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[ig]C[I think h1 garantees 2 eyes, but life/death is one of my many weak points.

al > To me, it looks like Black j4 or h1 makes the group live. Anything else, and white j4 kills the group.]
;B[gi]C[getting
greedy];W[fi]C[al> white should have playd j4 instead];B[hi]
;W[eb]C[now black group lives, I think.  Whatever the
case, white cannot see it living and I cannot see it dying, so on to defense
at d7];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[ca];B[hb]C[depending on whites play, g6 group
could be in a bit of trouble (not much), or I get j7 or e8 (not likely either
I think)];W[ga]C[good move for white
I cannot really threaten j7 now
can I threaten anything else?

al> Black can play h7 to capture J7 and reduce white's territory. White would have done better by connecting at G8]
;B[ib];W[hc];B[ba];W[ea];B[da];W[gb]C[did I miss something?]
;B[ca];W[fe];B[ih];W[tt];B[if]C[I don't like dame or loose ends, so I clean house a bit at the end (i.e. double eyes and dame only)

al> Before the last two black stones this group was worth 6 points. Now it is worth 3 + one prisoner = 4 pts.]
;W[bd]C[why bother?

al> Mistakes can always happen, and C5 is still open.];B[be]
;W[bc];B[ae];W[tt];B[ce]C[no loose ends :) even if it cost me 1 point.

al> Tying up loose ends has cost Black three  points by now. Had this been a closer game, that could have made a the difference between winning or losing.]

[ac][bc][ad][bd][cd][af][bf][hf][ag][ig][ah][ai][ii]C[black
14, white 9? I hope this is not considered stomping my opponent, because
this was a tough match for me. Often I lose to this opponent.

al> white's big mistake was to allow black to survive in the lower right corner, otherwise white was doing OK.]
