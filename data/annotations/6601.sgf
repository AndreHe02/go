C[Hi,
I played a game on littlegolem.com. In the game I played black. I really don't know my opponent by name or by real strenght, but in the site he is named "12" and are from Romania.
I lost by resignation.

I felt that I too early got a weak group and that my lower left got overconcentrated.

I have pointed out where I felt I made mistakes, or at least where I felt it was troublesome.
Of course I foremost want to have an review on black's move, but it is for the learning sake always interesting to know when the opponent did mistakes too (if any).

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards

(;B[op]C[Fel that this corner was biggest, and because I have the shimari I felt that I could go all the way.

Svante: This move is exactly what White wants, because he has Q10 and can play a very nice pincer. Usually, Black should keep back one place and play O3 or O4 to avoid the severe pincer. I think that that would also work quite well with the shimari in the lower left.]
;W[lp]C[Svante: This is White's aim with the right side formation. It is not as easy as in the Kobayashi fuseki (look it up at Sensei's Library), because White has no support in the lower left corner, but I think that it's still good.]
;B[on]C[This move I pondered a lot about. Which variation do you favour here? Q7?

Svante: This simple move is likely the best when you are outnumbered like this. However, it is still not easy for Black, as you will see later.]
;W[qn];B[jp]C[Svante: I think that playing this counter pincer now is good. Usually you would jump to P8 first, but because of Q10, that would not keep sente.]
;W[ln];B[qq];W[rq];B[ol]C[Svante: R3 is a good technique. Black now has options to later play either Q3 or Q4, depending on his needs on the lower side.]

(;W[ql]C[I think this is too easy for white, but I didn't find any better way.

Svante: White missed a very big chance: he should play Q7 here! That would keep his connection to Q10 in sente, and he can then help his M6 group.]
;B[ll];W[jn]
(;B[jl]C[Svante: Defending the lower side is now important to keep the white group weak, and it also oulines some territory.]
;W[iq]C[Svante: I think that Black can't do much to keep White from settling.]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[hq];W[kp]
(;B[ho]C[Svante: This lets White get H2. Better connect solidly. The territorial loss is at least 10 points.]
;W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr]C[Svante: White settles in sente and makes Black overconcentrated. Compare this with the result from H4 at move 27.]

(;B[ef]C[Svante: This helps White too much. If you can't follow up with a severe attack on the top group, Black gains very little from this, but White fixes his weakness.]
;W[dg];B[rd]C[Now this seems a bit slow. I have too be more agressive I think. Is r12 out of the question? I can extend to m17 even though it is a bit cramped later on....

Svante: It is certainly a very big point, and I do not feel that you are too much behind. Of course, it would be nice now to have E14 at C8. However, since you played E14, you should perhaps at least try to put pressure on the white group.]
;W[of]C[Seems like white is gaining more than white in this exchange.

Svante: I think that Black got more.]
(;B[oj]C[Push from behind can't be good but I wanted to secure my position a bit.

Svante: You could play the keima instead.];W[pi];B[cl];W[cp]
;B[dp];W[pq]C[big move I think for white. I am without base.

Svante: Your group is perfectly out to the centre, so it doesn't need a base. This is only big territorywise.]
;B[oq];W[qr]
(;B[lc]C[The last big point, at the same time make it possible to attack the white group later on?!

Svante: I like this move.];W[je];B[bc];W[re]
(;B[qd]C[Svante: The shape move for defence is R17 here, making T16 gote for White. The other possibility would be to assume that White can't achieve anything with S17 when you play R15 and take sente.]

;W[nr];B[nq];W[ms];B[mp];W[ls];B[mq];W[or]C[white is happy. No really weak group and a lot of territory on the right side.

Svante: Black has not too few points himself. Since White's bottom group was practically alive anyway, this gote connection is just some points.]

(;B[fl]C[Had to try to get some territory, But I am just defending now, so it seems difficult for black here.

Svante: I think that there are some bigger points available, like B10, L18, F18. In any case, you should try to play B10 before White can fix E9.]
;W[el];B[em];W[ek];B[gl];W[eg]
(;B[gf]C[Svante: If you can't attack, this is just a neutral point. I think that you should play L18 instead.]
;W[kb]
(;B[af]C[Felt that I couldn't just respond to white everywhere it should end the game too early.

Svante: I think that you should play B9 instead of this. That way, White's territory is open from both sides, the two monkey jumps being miai. You can also take the viewpoint that before, L18 and B9 were miai; so, when White takes L18, B9 is the natural move for Black.]

C[m18 is more likely better, but I hoped for some territory in the center otherwise I had too little points I thought.

Svante: What do you think now? Who is ahead, and by how much?]
;W[ph];B[fb]C[Svante: M18 should be bigger.];W[gb]
(;B[hj]C[p11 and h10 that's was my idea but it is a bit thin. Seems like wrong idea, but just defend seems too slow in this unfavourable position.

Svante: I may be wrong but I think that by just blocking M18, the game is very close.]

(;B[pb];W[pa]
(;B[qb];W[fa];B[ea];W[ga]C[Felt that after defending at E18 my opponent got sente and I had no possability to catch up.

Svante: How much behind do you think you are? I think that it's just 5-10 points -- this is far less than the "error margin" of amateur level endgame.

I got the feeling that you are used to either dominating your opponents or losing.
I think that you should not be afraid of a close game. One of the most important skills in Go is having the stamina to play a good game until the end, even if it takes more than 300 moves. Here, you seemed to panic when the endgame started without a clear advantage.

You could perhaps try to study some endgame, both standard situations and special tactics (tsumego). That way, you will perhaps feel more "at home" during the endgame, and you can play confidently even when it's close.]
