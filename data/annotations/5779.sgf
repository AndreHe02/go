C[I had black. I was winning until the end game. Actually I'm 7 k, but with this nick name I began with 5?.  So I'm pretty interested in understanding if i really could win nd if I really can play an even game with a 4 - 5 k.

The beginning is also interesting for me, cause it is the first time that I open this way, with two 3-4 stones.

Unfortunately my oppenent went away without saying nothing, so I don't know his feeling of the game, and if he understood that I'm a 7 k that is trying to handle an impossible game.

So thanks for you help, Mirco..


Hello,

 I hope you find the review helpfull. I prefer a territory based game and often open with two 3-4s.

I'm sorry, but by move 92, I think white is at least equal. You ran his dragons all around the board, but didn't profit from it.

The lesson you should work on here is, "How am I going to profit from pressuring white?" Rarely do you attack to kill. Attack and apply pressure for your profit.

Best Regards,
