(;W[fq]C[CG: I would prefer to play C10. If you look in a fuseki dictionary, C10 is the most common move.]
;B[ip]C[better at C6 or D6 ?

CG: I would prefer D6, too.];W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[CG: Attaching on the other stone might be a little bit better for black.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[cj]C[CG This result is good for white: The influence of the shimari is reduced while F3 is not yet captured.]
;B[eq];W[cg];B[em]C[better at R10 ?

CG: Yes, the exchange black E7 white D8 looks like aji keshi.]
;W[dl];B[po];W[nq]
(;B[er]C[better at R3 ?

CG: There are two things to say here. First, this move looks not like the best move locally. When you add another stone in a position where your opponent played tenuki, you should eliminate as much aji as possible - otherwise you waste your move! I think E2 leaves much more aji than F4 would.
Second, once black played Q5, he should continue (at R3). After white O3, it is much harder to settle the stone if white plays a pincer at Q8 or R7.]
;W[qj]C[CG: This pincer is too far away to make R3 bad!
Since you already played O3, a joseki where black runs to the center is not appealing for black. This in mind, you should play a pincer where the other option (R3) is not good either. I would choose among Q8, R8 or R7.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or]C[better at S2 ?

CG: Yes, white should of course play S2. But R8 would still give black a good result.]
;B[ql];W[kq];B[jq]
(;W[qf];B[hc]C[better at L17 ?

CG: I would play L4 first and then L17.];W[jd]C[better at K17 or N17 ?

CG: K17 looks ok to me. N17 would be too slow. Wether K17 or K16 is better is hard to say - the former is more concerned about territory, the latter takes control of the center.]
;B[md]C[good move or not ?

CG: Another difficult question. I don't think black has to start a fight immediately (he could also play a "normal" move like L4), but if he wants to start fighting, N16 is a good point to enter white's position. However, there is no reason white should be afraid of this fight.]

(;W[ic]C[CG: This move looks vulgar. I don't see a good way for black to connect if you just jump to the center.

You cannot expect to capture the black stone - your aim should be to keep the stone weak and take profit on the right side.]
;B[hd];W[jf];B[mf];W[mh]C[CG: An ambitious move - maybe too ambitious ..]
;B[lh]
(;W[jh]C[better at M13 ?

CG: What was the point playing N12 if you don't play M13 now?]
;B[mg]C[CG: This is a bad move that helps white.];W[mi];B[kg]
;W[jg];B[li];W[mj]C[CG: Black is helping white to get into the center - it's a pity P2 is not at S2 now!]
;B[ke]C[better at M10 ?

CG: Pushing at M10 also helps white, so living locally might be better.]
;W[je]
(;B[kf]C[better at M10 ?

CG: If black wants to live locally, he may play L16.];W[kp]
;B[im];W[ik]C[CG: The problem with moves like this is that the may end as neutral points. If you want to continue to attack the black group, a move like M17 looks more profitable.]
;B[fk]
(;W[fi]C[better at L9 ?

CG: Well, what is your plan? L9 might be sente against the black group, but it does not make points.
You seem to have lost your plan here - at least I cannot see any plan here. I would either play M17 (making some points while attacking) or P13 (trying to give M12 some meaning).]
;B[lj];W[rr]C[better at N9 ?

CG: Difficult question. Since black can't connect his groups with one move, S2 can't be a bad move.]
;B[rq]C[CG: This is a bad answer as it makes S2 a kikashi. Black should rather play a move like P8 or S10.]
;W[kr]C[CG: S2 was a good move as it threatened the eye space of blacks group. This is just an endgame move and not sente - black might for example enter at R16 now.  Although you cannot kill the black group, you should keep some pressure on it (e.g. play M17, O17 or P13).]
;B[jr];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[hr];W[bp];B[bq];W[nc]C[CG: This is a good move - threatening blacks group and eliminating much of the corner aji.]

C[better at P9 ?

CG: No, the three stones are more important than P10.];B[ok]

(;W[ol]C[better at Q10 ?

CG: Q10 is possible, but I don't think it is better. P10 is not an important stone as black is already alive.]

(;W[qk]C[better at Q9 ?

(;W[rl]C[better at L9 or N7 ?

CG: Why not P7?];B[om]
(;W[be]C[better at L9 or N7 ?

CG: B15 is ok as it is quite large and - even if black could capture them with one move, he would not allow white B16.]

;W[ef]C[CG: Again too small.];B[kl]C[CG: Now black is ahead.]
;W[ed]C[better at F15 ?
