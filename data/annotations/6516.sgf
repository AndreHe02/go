C[Hi reviewer! Thx in advance for your review and that you take your time! Just follow the questions and I'm quite happy or if you see somthing really big I didn't even see as a problem, you can write it down too. Just review for white. Thx again!]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[oyano [2k\]: Hallo];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[ci];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[nc]C[rs220675: I figured I can play tenuki here for a faster development. Is it possible?

* Yes it is.];B[qf];W[jd];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb]
;B[cg];W[ei];B[dl]C[rs220675: Moves like this puzzle me always esp. when played in the fuseki. Should I react and attack the stone right now or let it be there for the first and attack it later?

* Attacking the upper group was a good idea, but you you should be aware that D4 and D6 aren't very strong either.]
;W[eg]LB[ff:A]C[rs220675: Is this the right move for white?

* This move makes it easy for black to separate your groups. A may be better.]
;B[fe];W[ed];B[ee];W[ge];B[fg]
(;W[dg]LB[gf:B][fh:A]C[* There is no need to play this move. A or B instead looks better.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]
(;W[if]C[rs220675: Is the sequenze up to now ok for white?

* It is better to connect at H15.];B[cq];W[po]C[rs220675: Is this the right move or should I have reacted around D4?

* You should answer C3 because the two stones are getting weak now.]
;B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[np]TR[pn]C[rs220675:
1. I have no idea if this is joseki or if even this sequence is good for white.
2. Can one play tenuki after O4 or is there one more move urgent?

* Black can tenuki but the hane at Q6 seems to be very strong. This is why I would play Q6 as White instead of O4.]
;B[pc];W[ne];B[ld]LB[le:A]C[rs220675: Here again a move, I can't understand what to do. See my answer and please tell me if it's good or if there are better answer to this invasion. I tried to kill the stone and save my territoy plus avoiding the serparation of O17, O15.

* I think A is possible. But now the H15 aji can may become annoying.
Your move is ok, too.]
(;W[lf];B[nd];W[md];B[od]LB[mc:A]
(;W[me];B[mc];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb]C[rs220675: I think I messed up the sequence or did I get the best out of it?
* I don't think it is very bad for White.];B[iq];W[gh];B[gg]
;W[jh];B[hh];W[gj];B[ii];W[ik];B[jj];W[cp]C[rs220675: I figured the game still open at this point. The black stone at D8 should be mineand the territory around too. Please tell me where I did the mistakes in the following fight for this territory resp. esape of the black stones.

* I don't think you can say that D8 is dead. It can still escape especially because White is thin around H10. Thus a move to capture D8 is probably bigger than C4.]

(;W[co];B[fh];W[di]LB[ek:A]C[* This move leaves a weakness at F11. A is better.]
