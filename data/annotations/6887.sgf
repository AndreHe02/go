;W[dp]C[kprist [4k\]: merci];B[dc]C[stephand [4k\]: I do not feel confortable at this stage and tend to play at P3 so as to avoid a black move at K3. Am I right or should I play somewhere around Q4?

You must think this far before playing Q5];B[ce]C[stephand [4k\]: At this stage, I feel that white didn't achieve a lot and is still behind black

>> depends on opinion, I think it's still too early too say.

if you do badly when you're behind, try playing handicap games (as white).
you give weaker opponents between 2-4 stones, you'll be more confident when you're behind.]

(;W[gq]LB[fc:A]C[>> white f17 to  prevent black g17 instead and to protect top group indirectly.
similar to the right side, now bottom is uninteresting for either player because black has a Low-but stable group at the bottom right.]
