C[Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy 12k+ in IGS.

In this game I played against 10 k player with reverse komi. Eventhough I won, I feel I played very bad in this game (especially in end game, while white play great endgame.).

I hope you can help me improve my game.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Blondy-

TR[pm]C[Should I play Q7 here?

Actually I don't know any continuation with this move.

could you help me?



Don't worry about the 'correct joseki'.  Your move, an extension and a pincer, is fundamentally a good decision.  

Other options are shown too.];W[mo];B[mq]C[is this ok?

What's the better response here?



Again, seems fine.  At your level don't worry about playing stellar opening sequences, just play reasonable and natural moves.]

;B[ll]LB[oh:A]C[A, here, is crucial.  You need to wall W in.]
;W[oi]
(;B[dp]TR[oh]C[I am thinking about the possibility to cut at P12, but I decided to play here.


See variation.  
Also, D4 is a big point, so it is normal that you desire to play there.  But the action, hence, the urgent points, are still to be played on the right side.  Understanding this allowed me to get stronger.]
;W[og]TR[pi][pj][pk][qk][ll][nl][pl][om]C[White connecting here is a big turning point.  Where you could've had a strong group, radiating influence, you now have a group that you need to watch out for, and hence, a burden.]

perhaps.  what do you expect to do by blocking on this side?]
;W[rd];B[pc];W[re]TR[rc]SQ[pg][qg]C[should I play S17 and exchange my two stones?

no.];B[of];W[qb];B[pb];W[nf]
(;B[oe];W[rg]
(;B[ng]C[See variations];W[oh];B[mf];W[kc]C[This is important.  Your opponent has made a big mistake by playing too close to your thickness.  You should punish him by playing the variation.  Instead, you act as if YOU are on the defensive and go after territory with your next move.]

(;B[lc]C[Ugh.];W[kd];B[cf]LB[hc:B][hd:A]C[If anything, attack!]
;W[bd]LB[gc:A]C[Your apponent should've played here to connect.]
;B[ci];W[gd]
(;B[dn]TR[dm][cn][fp][fq]C[I quite doubt this move.

should I play one of triangle instead of this?


It's not so bad technically, its just that it's gote that buggs me.  I would look for ways to initiate sente and keep it in an attack.  Such as the variation.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]TR[dn][dp]C[Again, you are going for territory after you just played (2) HIGH stones!  That is inefficient and inconsistent.  

This would be a good move if you were strong on the right, but the marked stones are not yet secure.]
;W[fp];B[jq];W[fn]C[Ok, you have him on the run now.  What are you going to get out of this attack?  Let's see.]

(;B[dk]LB[ck:E][dl:A][dm:B][co:C][cq:D]C[This move shows that you are afraid of losing your territory on the side and are not thinking about the attack going on against the W stones.

You can't hope to keep any of this territory anyway,  W can do any of the following to it still.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[aq]C[Way too small.  Play somewhere else.]
;W[br];B[qa]C[bad move.

endgame move.];W[jo];B[ff]LB[gc:D][ic:C][fd:A][id:B]C[This just encourages W to strengthen himself with A.

Why not be more severe?  Like B, C, D];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef]
;W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[fd];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[bh]TR[jo][mo][po]C[small again.  W is thin on the bottom, why not try cutting?  playing stones in that area will also help settle your middle group and thwart the attack that W is going to try in his next move.]
;W[jl];B[kn]LB[lj:A][jk:C][no:B]C[bad move? where should I play here?

What did it accomplish other than to help W to connect himself?

Other options shown.];W[ko];B[mj]LB[kk:A]C[another bad move which made my group dead.

where should I play here?

It's actually a fine shape.  You could try A too.];W[kj]LB[nk:A]

[mq][pq]C[small. try the other options, they are all bigger, or at least sente.

I would vote for A, because it is a big endgame move, and it helps settle your bottom, thin group.

See the diiference between the varitions between W or B playing it.  The differnece between the two sequences is ~23 pts!]

Thank you once again and sorry for my bad English

don't apologize.  you did ok.  here is my advice:  
1. review my comments
2. read a book on endgame
3. stop being so afraid to lose territory
4. try playing a game where you ONLY go for influence, in order to appreciate it.
5. have fun!])
