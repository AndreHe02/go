C[In this game I was black, I play agains my KGS friend rondina(19k). Sometime ago I was completly slaughtered by rondina, but  this time I played a goodgame and lose just by 17,5. I think It's a good score to a 22k agains a 19k.

I habe some questions about why I can defend well  and make my groups live, but at the same, I lose territorie.

Ok, lets see the game.

And sorry for my poor english, hope you understand it...

Hello Mario, 

My name is Philip and I am about 11 k KGS. You can find me at philip101 on KGS or e-mail me at PhilipLondon@gmail.com. I'll mark all my comments with R:]
;B[pp]C[rondina [19k\]: tenha um bom jogo];W[dd]C[mairov [23k\]: vc tb]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[cf];W[ce]TR[dj]C[R: I know the focus is on black's moves, but this is a bad play for white. White should play this only when she has a stone around D10, so that black becomes overconcentrated. Here, black has room to expand down the whole side, and is in no danger of this overconcentration.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[dj];W[nc];B[qn]TR[nc][qd]LB[jp:A]C[I think R6 is a good hand, but I only play it becous I just don't know how attack the two white stones on right upper corner, can you give some tip?

R: It is hard to call R6 a bad move, but it is not an urgent one. Corner enclosures are less valuable for 4-4 points than for 3-4 points. It is often better to wait for white to approach the stone before deciding how to play. I would prefer A here.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[Is E3 a good hand? Or sould I play H3?
I dont know what is the best defend hand agains this keima attack...

R: See variations.];W[cn];B[cp];W[ck];B[cj];W[en];B[el]LB[dm:A]
C[R: A peep here At A would be the best way to attack the weak white stones.]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[fp];B[jp];W[iq];B[lq]TR[kr][mr][or][qr][rp]LB[jq:A]
[oq:B]C[Here I try do suport my K4 stone and at the same time get territorie on right down corner. Is it a good hand or there are a better one?

R: The move at J3 is generally a bad one by white because it provokes a response at A. A move at B secures the corner from an invasion, but I would prefer to first play at A.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[qg]
(;B[ok]TR[lo][nl][np][on]C[As the M3 hand, P9 try to make a lot of things at the same time:
1. suport R11 stone
2. attack R9
3. get influence

Are better hands Q11 or P11, or P9 is a good one?

R: I think that P9 is probably the losing move of this game. White can break through here with Q10, severely attacking the black stone at R11. P11 is the best move for black here. Of the three things you mention above, P11 accomplishes all of them. See variation.]
;W[pj];B[oj]C[Here I just sacrifice my R11 to make a more solid group...

Maybe P11 is better...?

R: Black has no choice but to play this way.];W[pi];B[jc]C[R: Good.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[lc];B[kb];W[hb];B[lb];W[mb];B[kd]C[R: A one point jump here to K15 would be faster.]
;W[fm];B[hm];W[ld];B[ke];W[ie];B[jf];W[le]TR[ne][of][pb][pe]
[rc][rf]C[Remember what I said in the beginning, I can defend and make my groups live, but I lose territorie...my K17 is alive, bu white make good territorie on upper right corner... I just don't know what to do about it!!!!! Give some help, please!

R: The earlier move at P9 has hurt black by giving white such a large corner. However, an invasion is still possible at C17, and black also has good prospects for territory in the center. A move by black at M14 would be huge in terms of reducing white and creating territory for black in the center.]
;B[lf]C[R: This is a very good move.];W[kn];B[mo]TR[kl]LB[io:B]
[oq:A][qq:C]C[Here I defend to make territorie, but if I play L8 I can try to get that L6 stone...I think I can't do it, I'm just a 22k, and If I try it and don't get the white stone I just lose a lot of territorie..., so I play a more defensive hand (N5)

Help me about that! Maybe in a free game I try L8, but not in a reanked game....

R: If black wishes to defend here, the move should be at A, because this move would protect the corner. The variations are complicated, but if white invades at C with the stones how they are now, she can create a ko for life in the corner.  However, L6 is indeed an overplay by white. The best way to attack it is to play B, preventing white from linking up with other stones. This move would leave white with nowhere to go. One idea here which could help you decide between A and B would be to count the score.

Black has about 12 in the lower left corner, 12 on the left, 5 on the top, and about 30 on the bottom if A is played. Total: 59 points
White has about 45 in the top right corner, 10 in the bottom, and about 15 in the top left corner (since an invasion at C17 is still possible). Total 70  + 6.5 komi = 76.5 points.

Black is behind, and should play B and try to kill the stone at L6.]

LB[gk:A]C[R: Empty triangles are usually bad shape. If black wishes to connect here, the correct move locally is A.]
;W[jk];B[hj]TR[eh][fh]LB[ff:A]C[Here I want to play E12 or F12, but at the same time I was afraid to lose territorie, so I played H10... Bad move?

R: E12 and F12 don't really secure much territory. F14 seems like a good move for black.]
;W[fh];B[eh]LB[ff:A]C[R: Here black should be thinking attack instead of defend! A move at A would put severe pressure on the white stone.]

C[R: Good.];W[ne];B[of];W[od]LB[pe:A]C[R: White at A here would prevent her stones from being cut off.]

;B[sh];W[rf];B[oi]C[R: It seems black has taken the lead with this sequence.]
;W[mh];B[mf];W[jq];B[kq];W[ip]LB[cc:B][qq:A]C[by the score est. I am wining the game now by 9,5... but from now, I just start  to lose point and at the and...I lose...

How should I play from now? Is it yose?

R: If black plays a solid endgame, he should win the game. The invasions at A and B are big for both players. Also, if black can secure a large lower left corner, that will help him keep the lead.]
;B[jo];W[lo];B[lp];W[jn];B[ko];W[ln];B[pk]LB[cc:A]C[R: This is not needed. Invading at A would seal the win for black.]

R: Overall, I think both players played solid games. It seems that as you said, you are good at defending weak groups. It would be helpful for you to work on attacking your opponent's weak groups. Also, try to study some simple corner invasions, so you can better determine when an invasion is posisble. White made a couple of approach moves deep into black's moyo. It is helpful to try to estimate the score during the game, so you can determine how aggressively to respond to white's reductions. One more piece of advice is to work on your endgame a little bit. Black played some gote moves near the end of the game which were not necessary. The best way to improve the endgame is probably just to play as much as possible. Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.]

(;B[oi];W[ok];B[mi];W[mk]TR[ek][el][jp][lq][mi][oi][pp][qi]
[qn]C[R: White is being attacked by all sides, and even if black can not kill these stones, black will secure so much thickness from the fight, that he can invade white's positions throughout the board. Black is in a good position to win the game from this point.]
))
(;B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq]C[R: This variation gives black sente, and secures a lot of fourth line territory on the left. With this line of play, it becomes clear that white's earlier move at C15 has given black a perfect extension.]
)
(;B[hq];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[go]C[R: I like this variation as well. The moves played are joseki for both players. Black has a thick position on the left side. However, black ends in gote.]
