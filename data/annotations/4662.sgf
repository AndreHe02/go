C[khot78 (I am black) [16 kyu DGS\] VS chrise [8 kyu DGS\]
While I play chrise and lose quite often, 64 points is a little too much.  I would like to know where are my worst mistakes and what I should concentrate on improving.
Thanking you in advance!];B[pd]C[first i would like to say, that the handicap should be 8 stones, and it is a huge handicap. playing as you do against a stronger player is also a good way to progress, though.]
;W[dc];B[qp];W[op]TR[lq][mq]C[If you decide to play R4 as here, you should be ready to pincer the approach move of white]
;B[pn];W[nn]TR[mp][pq];B[dp]TR[jp][jq]C[khot78: did I have to respond to W6, or can I tenuki, and play as I did?

best thing is tenuki here, because your stones are not in danger, and your next move sdhould be near the hoshi in this area]
;W[qq]TR[rq]C[here white is trying to stabilize, and to steal the corner]
;B[de]C[khot78: I did not feeling being pushed around, so I played elsewhere, again tenuki.

here black should have answered last white's move];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[joseki ok];W[pf]TR[nd][qe]
(;B[pj]TR[ph][qh][qi]C[here normal pincers are around here. there is no pressure on the white stone with q10]
;W[pl]TR[oo][pp][rq]SQ[ql][om]C[khot78: htis invasion surprised me.  What should I have done to respond?

now the situation is preety bad for the stones at the bottom. you can try to put pressure on the net at the bottom with either of those triangled points, or break through the blocus with squared move. 

another solution is to put pressure on white's stone with something like q12, but it is somehow slow anyway]
;B[ol];W[om];B[pm];W[ql];B[ok];W[rj]TR[qi]C[see the variation diagram for a correct sequence]

(;B[ri]C[at this point, I decided to sacrifice the R4 group, thinking it would be too difficult to save.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rk];B[rh];W[rn];B[ph]C[ok];W[qo]TR[nd];B[jc]
;W[md]TR[oe]C[Khot78: N16 really intimidated me, and I did not know if I should extend from K17 or split Q14.  I felt the sacrifice at the lower left was only worth it if Q14 dies, so I was worried.

n16 is a probe move. it should be answered to with determination. P15 seems to be the only right answer]
;B[oe]C[see the variation to capture q14]
(;W[ke]TR[mb][lc][je];B[ie];W[oc]C[again, white is aiming toward the corner.]
;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[mf];B[of];W[jg];B[iq]C[here black has 50 pts approx plus a good deal of influence, and white has 60pts]
;W[dm];B[ek];W[gp]TR[cn][lq]C[here black should not feel too opressed with d4 : the two approach moves of white are quite slow]
;B[dq]C[Instead of D3, what should I have played?  the next moe, G6 was painful!]
;W[gm];B[bm];W[lq]TR[gd][io][gq]C[now j3 is calling for help

G3 seems to be the best point here because j3 still has aji

at the top, g16 could do the job of connecting black's stones.]

(;B[fd]C[do not tenuki too often ...];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[he]
;W[id];B[jd];W[ed];B[ee];W[je]TR[gk]C[g 9 is **huge**]
(;B[hg];W[gk]TR[ml]C[with whites large territory, I felt I had to take the center... so ....

here n8 was able to destroy a part of white's influence];B[mh]
C[I played this, but it was not enough...


h13 and n12 are typical bad moves, it costs a lot.];W[io]C[here you could try j3 just to test white's answer. a good strategy is to try to understand how your opponent plays]
;B[ll];W[fq]C[now j3 is quite dead];B[cn];W[en]C[see how white's stones are overconcentrated in the bottom left ??! E6 is dame]
;B[nm];W[on]TR[ln];B[mm];W[lo];B[hl];W[ji]CR[jl]TR[gl]SQ[fi]

[jk];B[jk];W[ki];B[lj];W[nh];B[ni];W[er];B[dr];W[nd]LB[od:A]
[pe:B]C[here A and B are miai. if white plays A, then Balck B]
;B[od];W[mb];B[kr]C[Is this overstretching?

it's interesting to give it a try];W[lr];B[gr];W[jr];B[kn];W[ko]
;B[ln];W[mo]TR[fe]C[here the rule is to reinforce before attacking]
;B[dd];W[fe];B[ff];W[be];B[fd];W[ec]TR[bf]C[B14 is huge, **huuuge** never forget

before whites plays there, the score is approx 90 pts for black and 130 pts for white. the play here is worth 10 pts

I'll stop here for the review. hope it was interesting 

try to play against a lot of different opponents. if you avoid mistakes, you could play great games !]
