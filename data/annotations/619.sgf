(;B[jp]C[This is a very big point, which you should look to take as soon
as possible, but I think I'd want to strengthen the corner first - go
back to see a variation.];W[jd];B[qj];W[dj];B[qg];W[co];B[do]
LB[cp:a]C[Good - attempting to defend the corner by playing 'a' would
leave your position rather weak.];W[cp];B[cq];W[jj]LB[dq:a]
[bq:b]C[This move really sets the character of the game. The board is
split in half, but the White half is bigger than your half. This means
that you must plan to invade at some point; you can't expect to compete
purely by moyo-building. This doesn't mean you have to dive in
immediately, but you do have to bear this in mind.


(Note: there's a very large move left in the lower left corner. The
difference between White playing 'a' and Black playing 'b' looks to be
well over 20 points and helps to strengthen your position.)]
;B[lj]LB[bq:a][nd:b][jl:c]C[If you try to build a moyo in the bottom right, it's bound to be
smaller than White's in the top left. I'd prefer to take the big point
at 'a', attack/invade at 'b' or, if you want to build a moyo, build up
from the bottom edge with 'c'.];W[jg];B[jl]LB[kk:a][kl:b]C[This leaves an obvious route into your moyo at 'a'. Playing 'b'
would be better shape.];W[gj]LB[ec:a]C[White only needs one more move, around 'a', to turn the top left
moyo into territory, so this would be a good time to invade. However, it
might not be necessary - have a look at the variation.]

;B[qe]LB[qd:a][nd:b]C[The exchange of this for the White answer at 'a' helps White
strengthen the corner group and defend the territory, so it would be
better left unplayed. I'd play at 'b' (the usual move in this sort of
shape), leaving the possibility of invading the corner later.]
;W[qd];B[ne];W[lc]LB[dq:a][ec:b]C[Fairly big, but I'd play 'a' or 'b' instead.]
;B[og]LB[of:a]C['a' would be a more secure connection.];W[nl]
;B[nm];W[lm];B[mm];W[jm];B[ln];W[il];B[jn]C[Good - sacrificing the stone helps you seal off your lower right
moyo.];W[im];B[in];W[nj];B[ok]LB[ol:a]C[The atari at 'a' would do most of the work of your next two
moves on its own.];W[nk];B[ol];W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[fn]
(;W[fq]LB[dq:a]C[Greedy - White can just cut at 'a' and take the corner
territory.];B[dq]C[Good. This is a big move just for the corner, and stands a good
chance of killing the White invasion.];W[iq];B[jr];W[jq];B[kq]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[er]
(;B[eq]LB[gr:a]C['a' is the key point here. If White plays it, he gets good eye
shape. Go back to see what happens if you play it now.];W[dr]

;B[hp];W[hq];B[ds]LB[gr:a]C[I think this allows White to live or connect out by playing 'a'
- see the variation.]
(;W[fs];B[gr];W[es]C[This only threatens to make a false eye, so you can ignore it.]
;B[fr];W[cs]C[Again, this doesn't threaten to make an eye, so you can take
sente, e.g. to invade the top left.];B[gs];W[nb];B[of];W[ec]

;B[am]LB[al:a][bd:b]C[White could just give you this stone by playing 'a' and
strengthening the rest of the moyo. A contact move against the shimari,
e.g. 'b', might be your best chance.];W[bn];B[ak];W[tt]C[Passing at this point seems unnecessarily risky, but it's
