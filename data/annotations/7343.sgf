C[AKODA: Hi!
Patten: hi

Overall, I think you played well, but you have a bad habit of playing away from weak groups before they're stabilized.  In some cases, your opponent was kind and played away as well, and in other cases, it came back to bite you (such as losing a critical group).]

(;B[mc]C[If you're going to give up the M16 stone, consider M17 here instead.  it gives a more secure base that should ease concerns later.]
;W[lb]C[You should play N8 here.]
(;B[gc];W[md];B[db]C[This feels like a really uncomfortable state for the black stones.  There's hardly any base and it's a long extension.  I feel like you later lose move(s) because of this.]
;W[cj];B[df];W[ef];B[de];W[ed];B[ec]C[A move lost because of the weak top group]
;W[cd];B[dh];W[cb];B[dk]C[This hurts your 3 stones floating on the 4th line.  You should really find a way to ensure their safety before moving on to a new battle.  You can't kill white's stone or even effectively pressure it because of the weak stones nearby.]
;W[dj];B[eg];W[ck];B[fq]C[Same comment as two moves ago.  You should really be solidifying the left group.]

;W[sq];B[lp];W[kp];B[pp];W[qo]
(;B[kq]C[This weakens F3.  Consider the relatively simple move of M5 instead.  You'll have center access and a solid base to press against white's weak stones.  It should have the side effect of strengthening F3 instead of weakening it.]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr]
(;B[lr]C[This is too passive.  You can atari the outside white stone for some enhanced outside presence.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[jo]C[Please compare this to the other variations where you don't play M2 immediately.  This should look significantly worse.]
