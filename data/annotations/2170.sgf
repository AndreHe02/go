C[Hi, my rank in Italy is 7kyu, even if I'm not able to achieve such a rank in IGS.

Even
if in this match I've done some mistakes, I ask you to review it
because I had a lot of doubts about the strategy to follow.

The problem I feel in this period of my "Go-growth" is that I am not always
able to identify "what to do next", in terms of strategy.

I would be very happy if you could comment this match by explaining to me
the kind of reasoning you do while playing a match like this, so that I
can grab some of your experience.
I've tried to add to this SGF file some comments.
The idea is to try to show you how I think during a match, so that you can "reprove" myself more effectively :-P

Finally, sample variations explaining how to "implement" strategical decisions will be welcome, you cannot imagine how much :)

Just a final reccommendation: don't tell me that I've played a good match. The more you criticize, the more I'll learn!!

Thanks in advance for the time you are going to spend for me!

Review , for white, by johngrae 5k IGS];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[cd]
;B[jq]
(;W[ic]C[I've never seen this opening strategy.
I didn't like to complete my Chinese opening, but I wasn't able to find out any weak point in Black's formation.
Q5,
good move if one thinks about Q16, can be responded with either R5 or
04, or even P4, and all these responses seem to me positive for Black.
Moreover, approaching D4 seemed to me a bit premature...

Any hint???

J:
I see nothing wrong with your move. It is not necessary to rush to
approach black.   If both sides continue with their development there
will come a time when you should approach / invade.

If I wanted to approach q5 seems the best. Black might also  pincer with r7.]
;B[ed];W[df];B[ef]C[Another
strange move to me. I extended, to make secure points on the left, but
if Black gets strong , what about my stone in J17? In the Chinese
opening it is meant to be a pressing stone, not one to worry about.

A lot of doubts were in my head...

J: Extending seems good to me.

The idea is to let black jump in and make territory on the left side while attacking.

J17 seems in no danger yet. There should come an  appropriate time to strengthen it and also make a good position on the top]
;W[dg];B[dd];W[cc]C[I think this lastest exchange has been very good for White :)

J: Yes I agree. White is good on the side and corner. Black still has a weak group]
;B[hd]C[Mmmmh! Now the problem I foresaw... How to effectively develop J17?]

(;W[id]C[J: this gives black the opportunity to hane.

See the alternatives];B[ie]
(;W[je]C[What about H15? I was not able to read, so I didn't dare...

J:  Well this seems  OK. White is getting a lot in the top right while black struggles to live.

H15 feels aggressive to me];B[if]
(;W[md]C[J;  This is too passive.

N16 aims to make a big territory but it gives up sente. black still has all
those stones at the bottom which can also develop into a big territory
so black seems to have equal if not more potential.

 I would prefer a different move. A 5k cannot tell you the best move but the variations show you how I would be thinking.]
;B[qc]C[I welcome this invasion by Black. I thought at that point the goban was still full of greater opportunities than R17.

J:
Well the invasion does significantly reduce your territory on the top.
It also gets a bit of corner territory. Therefore I do not think it is
so bad.

For black i would prefer Q10. this builds a double wing
formation which would also work well as a centre moyo if black turns at
k14.

I think white would not have time to secure the corner and so this invasion could come later.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[pb]
;W[ob];B[qb];W[nc];B[jf]C[J:
notice - black reduced your top a lot and had sente to push in like
this.   black played one more stone on the second line than was needed.
Usually that would be bad but here the white wall is not so effective
if black can keep pushing after k14.   As you found later in the game
this wall does not give white a lot.

Notice white has still not
played a single stone in the lower half of the board. black has
appraoched and limited the potential white had on the top.

White desperately needs sente to play on the bottom as soon as possible.]

[mc][mb][ma][nb][na][nd][od][oc][pe][pf][oe][ib][ia][ld]CR[ra]
[sa][rb][sb][rc][sc][rd][sd][se]C[At this point I thought about the next move quite a lot.

Many plans in my head:

1) Play M14 and get some points out of the wall on the right.
2) Approach Black at the bottom.
3) Make some hiraki, either on the right or on the left.

At the end, I played...

J:  Making territory out of the wall is small at this stage.

The black group top left is pretty stable so there sems no way to threaten it profitably.

If we estimate what might turn into territory white has 41 as an
optimistic estimate. May get more from the wall as things progress.
There is the possibility of expansion down the left but otherwise the
rest of the board is black's sphere of influence

Black has only 9 sure points but lots  more potential

So the game is going to depend one one thing - can white reduce black to
keep his points to fewer than perhaps 60 - assuming white has the time
to expand a bit. Put another way can black get 55+  points from the
bottom and centre?

There seems a good chance of that if white lets black get another move or two to expand and consolidate.

Therefore it is time to play on the bottom.];W[eg]
(;B[ff]C[Just an exchange to strengthen my group, and ...

J: I think black shoud have ignored this. giving white time to expand down the side from the strong d13 group was a mistake.

I would play  c7 or perhaps risk d10.   R5 would start black gaining
territory fast but I prefer a move on the left which expands and at the
same time reduces white's chances to grow the side];W[ck];B[qn]
C[Shit! The problem is: I had no idea on how to play some stones on the lower right corner to reduce Black.
I hated that situation.

J:
This is inevitable. White has a big lead in firm territory. The price
you pay is black having a large area which you must invade.   It is
still a question of limiting black to 50 points on the bottom.   The
black framework is loose. You need to decide whether you are invading
or reducing.

I'll discuss some possibilities, see variations on next move]

(;W[ql]C[j:
This is no real help. White has little territory to gain on the side.
This will force black to jump towards the centre making a larger
framework which is harder to invade.

This be where the game started to go wrong for you.

I've given some alternative ideas.];B[on]C[Even worse!!! Aaaargh!
Also R8 is quite ineffective, thanks to S12 missing, and R10 also possible for Black! Panic!!

J:  Too late to panic :)];W[ol]C[J:  This simply makes things worse.

White is not building much territory above (the black stone at L14 is ready
to jump in and stop it) Black is gaining lots of points below.

One of the previous invasions was still the better move, but it would have to be on the left now.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[mf]C[J:  black has given back sente in exchange for destroying any hopes you had of forming territory behind that wall.

I'm not sure if that was the best for black. white certainly had the chance
to form many points but with two moves black could have created more I
think

Its still OK for black though.];W[jo]C[Ok, let's play some
very well known moves. Something will come out from that situation,
hopefully...];B[lp]
(;W[hp]C[Is my response correct? I know
nothing about these joseki. Could you give me a hint about where to
surf on the net or which books to read for dealing with my lack?

J: I suggest "Get strong at invading" it will help with all your problems so far in this game.]
;B[fp]
(;W[iq]C[As soon  as I played that move, I felt it was wrong. The only problem is that I really don't have any idea about how to do a good sabaki ...

J: well, the stones are not working well together. They are clumping close
together and becoming a traget for attack not a light and flexible
shape .];B[jp]
(;W[ip]C[J:  empty triangle and a heavy group at the same time.

The point with sabaki is the flexibility to let some of the stones die if necessary. black now has something worth attacking]
;B[gq];W[ir];B[jr]C[What to do next? My doubt was between C3, C4, C6 and B5. I decided to...]

(;W[bo]C[J:
this is leaving a weak group in the middle. Its important that white
comes out of the moves on the side with sente to do something about
this middle group

i would have played a conservative move to strengthen the group]
;B[bp];W[co];B[cp];W[do]C[J:
this has made nearly 20 solid points for black. In exchange white has
got perhaps 10 points - with potential for more by expanding the left
if there is a chance to play f6.......];B[fn]C[J: the trouble is f6 is just too good for black.

It attacks the heavy centre gruop and reduces white's potential]
;W[hn];B[gm]
(;W[hm];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[dk]C[Aargh! What a mistake!!!!
C8 -> B8 -> B7 -> B9 -> C6 !!!!
Actually, I played D9 with very little in my mind :(];B[cl]
;W[bl];B[ek]C[WOW. Thanks to Black, I can make up for my mistake...]

(;W[cn];B[dj];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[fi]C[
Summary of th consequences of my error at move 69:

1) My group is definitely sealed in.
2) Quite a big reduction!
3) Black threats to make a lot o points in the center.

It was White threatening that!!!! AAaaaargh!

J: No white was not really threating to make much in the centre]

(;W[km]C[J: this seems to fall between two ideas.

Is white runnnig hard to connect to the group on the right?

Is white expecting to live in the middle and erase as much as possible of black in the centre?]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[mm];W[kk]C[J: Score now:

 black around 75 plus something in the centre
 white around  55 plus possibly a bit more in the top left corner

The heavy group formed by the failed invasion is going to cost the game.
All black has to do is chase it a bit and then make sure of life for
the top group];B[mk]
(;W[pj]C[The stupid way I played R8 and P8 is now resulting in purely defensive moves, giving Black the initiative :(]
;B[kj]C[Yeah,
what I was waiting for... Oh, shit!!!];W[jk]C[Do you think K10 is
possible? It would more effective, I think, but my thought was that my
group was still too weak to afford a fight...

J: it doesn't matter - black does not need to kill. If black builds up centre territory then the lead is assured

White may as well take the risk, there is nothing to lose.]

Generally you need to work more on invading and getting a better feel for the difference between light and heavy groups. Timing as well as position
of invasions is important])

White does not have a lot of ways to reduce the bottom left much now. I might be tempted to simply play this]

(;W[gq]C[J:
perhaps this,   White is making inroads into the territory black would
like at the bottom. also the 2 black stones are begining, (only
beginning) to look cut off and under attack.

it begins to look as if white may get some moves to make an eye against the bottom edge

finally
white is still well poised to run away to keep at least some of these
stones alive. Remember, White is happy to lose the k5 stone if the
others live.]))
(;W[iq]C[J:   White need not respond at all. The
k5 stone is fairly safe and I don't see black gaining that much by
attacking it - except possibly with a capping move.

Even though this encourages black to make a more solid territory it seems OK

Black has the right to get a lot of territory since he strated with three stones to none on the bottom half of the board

If black takes L13 white can defend and secure the top - while keeping the potential on the side

As a second objective white is preparing to approach the q3 stone . A
black pincer move wil be less good so white can hope for some territory
on the side.])
(;W[kg]C[J;

This avoids pushing from
behind with k14 and I think it is safe if black pushes at k14. I'm not
conviced its ideal though.   It is much higher then your move. It gives
white a large potential in the corner. I think black would feel
compelled to respond , perhaps with Q10 so you would keep sente to
either secure the corner, continue the attack or approach at say c6]

Here I'm thinking that the black k3 stone is low. this means white has
the capping move at k5 for the future if black threatens to build his
own moyo.

The white position above is quite strong so if black pincers white might be happy to attack the pincer stone.

So what joseki will follow? I've no idea but I will be happy with either a
result establishing a group in the corner q4, r3 etc  or making a wall
from p4,o4 etc.]))
