C[hello, i am playing white here and will mark my comments with "H:"

thanks for your review!

C: I'm Christoph, 7 kyu. I was trying to finish soon, as you've been waiting for this review a long time. As a result, my analysis may be less than thorough.
Looks like a god game to me. Both you and your opponent often played slower than necessary, so the results of such mutual politeness canceled out. You can afford to play a more aggressive style. I hope I was able to point out a few instances.]

C[H: my idea was to prevent the extension from A and B. but after black C and white D i felt somewhat inferior

C: The move is good, since it neutralizes the influence of B's shimari. It implants a group that once and for all erases Black's potential of getting a moyo on the right side. You can't expect to come out ahead in Black's sphere of influence.]
;B[pm];W[qg];B[mc];W[cj]C[C: The result is favourable. Even though you got White, you managed to make a sanren sei on your side while implanting a group in Black's side.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[ck];W[dj]LB[cf:C][cj:D][dj:E][ck:A][cm:B]C[H: what about this stone at E? my idea was to put pressure on his A-B group to get some walls when he tries to evade.
but i feared  a counterattack around C and did not know how to handle that (which happily did not happen)

C: The move seems OK to me. Black must defend if he wants to survive, giving you the time to play at C. Counterattacking just leaves Black with two weak groups instead of one.
All in all, a well played opening !];B[dk];W[cf]LB[dd:C][cf:B]
[dj:A]C[H: now i liked the A stone as it fits nicely with B (and C)]
;B[cc]
(;W[cd]C[C: Here I would block from the other side, for two reasons:
1) The stone on C14 may give you chances of killing
2) If Black survives, White makes extra territory on the upper side. See the variation]

(;W[mm]LB[mn:A][nn:B][mo:C][no:D]C[H: would another stone (A, B, C, D) have been better? my move reduced his moyo, but i was not happy with the territory he got here in the end

C: I'm not an expert. Unless chances are of making life, I wouldn't dive too deep into enemy territory. I might have played the same move, except that it's probably better to start with J7, attacking Black's group while at the same time building support for your action against his moyo. But, this is just a feeling - I can't prove my point rigorously.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[no]
(;W[ol]C[C: Too passive. Both your groups are safe, since you can allways run to the center, and S15 and S8 are miai. So you can keep pushing into Black's territory.]
;B[om]
(;W[nm]C[C: Definitely too passive. You have nothing to fear or defend, so why not keep attacking (variation)]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[on]C[C: Black has safe territory here, so for him, a defensive move is OK.]

(;W[ek]LB[el:A]C[H: unfortunately i did just think of reducing his territory here. could i have killed him? A would probably have given him more to think about

C: I think your move is better than A (see variation). In the continuation, you had killing chances.]
