C[Dear reviewer. My name is Biondy 15 k player in IGS. This game is against 12 k player. Maybe this is weird, but I'm playing as white here. I don't know why but my opponent offered me a game which I play as white and I accepted it.

I think my opponent isn't that strong, because he did many moves which give me advantages which the move can be avoided, but I'm still losing this game.

I think the problem is my attacking. My moyo in the bottom board is very wide, but I live with 2 eyes in the upper board which I think very disadvantage me.

Please help me in this game];B[cp];W[pq];B[dc];W[eq]C[I very much like this opening when I'm playing as white

should be ok];B[dq];W[ep];B[cm]
(;W[hq]C[now this is too close

you need to extend further away from two stones on second line. this is the extension you would play from a single stone.]
;B[qd]
(;W[oc]C[this is probably ok, I recommend a higher approach though because there are no good pincers for black]
;B[mc];W[oe];B[qf]
(;W[mf]C[this is a little bit unusual too me
I would try one of the following moves];B[jc]
(;W[qn];B[qi]
(;W[og]TR[oe][mf]C[I think this move make my Move 14 become in a strange position

actually that is good shape
yet I dont know about the move itself.
Maybe approach d17 first];B[ql]
(;W[mq]C[now you have a lot of stones on the third row. you can easily be pushed down to little territory. therefore you should play higher]

(;B[df]C[Black takes the lead]
(;W[fl]TR[po][lp]C[In the beginning I wanted to take the D10, but I thik I must support before attacking. But black took it before me

This move is too high. As argued before your bottom moyo is easily destroyed by sholder hit plays like m4 or attacking the weakness at q5. So this stone does not really build a whole lot of territory but invites black to reenforce his position on the left side.

Instead of taking d10 you should have approached his D17 stone before he played d14.

Now c12 would be better since it can not be killed easily];B[dj]
C[as he did now];W[ch]C[It's very risky, but I think I must try to attack the left side

It's ok but be prepared to sacrifice some stones. You tried to safe every single one (I think you also managed too). That way black got a lot of strength]

(;B[li]C[I think it's better for black to play L13 than this move

now the game seems lost. you have two weak groups and he can attack both at the same time. The problem was created with move 26. You still should be able to live with both groups but black will profit a lot]

Maybe I only ask above, but don't hesitate to tell me more.

And one more thing if you give me variation, would you like to tell me what program you use? Because I have 3 go programs but 1 like to error, the othr can't give var, and the last make the game strange when I make variation (the real move and the var is traded)

Thanks in advance


I use CGoban, the program that comes with the KGS go server. http://www.gokgs.com/download.xhtml
I like it and the server a lot since it offers great teaching opportunities.

I think there are three things you should do to improve:

1) Life and Death (everyone needs that)
2) Learn about the beginning! Your timing was not very good in the beginning and your invasion at c12 lost you the game. Try looking at the first moves of Pro games for example.
3) Think much more in the endgame! Try to stay in sente and take ALL your sente points before playing gote!! 

If you have any more questions don't hesitate to email me. If you need some more advice I can always offer a game review on KGS, since it is realtime it's much easier to answer questions there.]
