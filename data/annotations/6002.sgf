AB[cc][gc][ee][cg][gg]C[Hi, im David, i will  review this 9x9 game.
(B): this sign means that the comment goes for black 
(W): this that the comment goes for white.
(see more): this means that i put some variations on the game.]
;W[dg]C[(W): attaching to a stone (playing next to one of the enemy), its a play for living, i suggest that you use it only for live (get to eyes or something) and when youre sure that you can do it right.
(B): You need to strength your positions, since you got handicap, the best thing to do its try to link this stones(see variations).]

(;B[dh];W[eg]C[(W): good moves for white, its trying to live following the principle of attach to a stone.
(B): your answer its not bad, but you should always remember that the game its not about capturing stones its about making territory (my kind of view, so dont take to strongly).]
;B[eh]C[Here I wanted to trap the white into going towards black]
;W[ch]C[as you can see, the move on a its not too good, so b its a better one.]

(;B[fh];W[bh]C[(B) remember about the ladder, so in this case the best move its trying again to connect your stones. (see variation)]

C["trying to protect the black piece"<-- good];W[df]TR[bh]C[(B) remember about counting your liberties when your fighting with groups.
in his case the triangle move, would had been better (see variation)]

(;B[ef];W[bh]TR[bf]C[(B): playing on b4 (triangle), would have given you mor liberties (see variation)]

(;W[ae];B[bd]C[(B)a interesting move, protects both cutting points]
;W[ad];B[ac];W[ab]C[The response on this case its connect with b7(see variation)]

(;B[bb];W[bc];B[ca];W[ac]C[not a really good move, the best will be protect the cutting point on D5 (see variations)]

(;B[ga]C[if i would have placed the piece on J9, then it would have taken the three pieces. <-- Your right If you do that, your group its not alive anyway so it doesn really matter.this have no meaning if you already lost all your group (20 stones). good thought]
;W[ia];B[if];W[ib]C[Black its already alive, so it doesnt need to fill its space with more stones, that only takes a point.]
;B[hg];W[id];B[ie];W[fe]C[End game.
You have a good sense of game direction.i think thar your game its lacking some practice on the basics, like the ladders and the life and death forms, but  I recomend you trying to solve some problems (you can find a lot if you search on the net) to amend this.
i guess thats all, good luck on your games, i hope that this review were useful to you.
