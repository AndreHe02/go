C[Youngmin [9k?\]: hey
Bluebottle [10k\]: hi there

Hi there,

I've sprinkled comments through the game. Apart from small things, the main issue is an invasion on the right that I did not respond to properly,, and that lost me the game.

Claude Brisson> Ok, let's see...];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep]
;W[gp]TR[dm][en][cq]C[I havw not come across this response. Sensei's Library suggests a few responses. I did not really have a plan in responding to this move, and it shows.

CB> I think the best response in this case is E6 (or D7 but it is more complex) - since white has the upper left corner, it's important that you keep the outside to avoid white building a wall in front of D17]
;B[dn]C[CB> the joseki dictionnaries qualifies your move as a mistake, but at your level it is not that much important]

(;W[cn]C[CB> white should not play like this, since he lets you reinforce yourself and G4 become lonely... see var]

(;B[cq]C[CB> you must continue on the outside! if you wanted to keep the corner, you could play here first before D6, but don't change your mind, playing once on the outside and then inside: it's important AT EACH MOVE to make plans and to try to follow them: "better a bad plan than no plan at all".]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[eo]
(;B[fp]C[CB> this is too nice...];W[fo];B[gq]C[CB> now the black shape is not very good]

(;W[nq]C[CB> white can enclose black in the corner - plus, the fight is not over!]

(;B[qn]C[CB> white was wrong to tenuki, show him why!];W[kq]
C[CB> from now on, you should both come back to the fight on the lower left almost at each move, but I'm not gonna repeat it :-)
CB> you should never leave fights unfinished when the outcome is so big]
;B[hq]C[CB> not necessary: apart from D5, there is no reason to play in this area because:
 - you are already alive in the corner
 - your move does not really attack the two white stones, which can escape or make eyes by playing at Q2

Since it is not urgent nor threatening, you should play elsewhere because this area is very small!]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[go]C[CB> white finally fixed his weakness here... too bad you missed it.]
;B[jd]TR[qi]C[Did I extend in the wrong direction here? Would something around the marked stone be better to keep my groups together?

CB> no, it is too slow - of course it would be better to connect them, but you must play in the big areas otherwise white will do so - think globally!]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[CB> good];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[CB> NEVER hane when there is a stone at R14!]
(;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[of]
(;B[oh]C[CB> I think you must protect the cut right now (but if white cuts it's rather complex...)]

(;W[mf]
(;B[mh]C[CB> white is playing inside, that is not very good... you are building a large moyo on the right.]
;W[kf];B[oe]C[CB> I think it is ok...];W[ne]C[CB> white could maybe take the sente to play elsewhere]

(;B[pf]C[CB> the cut doesn't work now that white answered... you should leave, it could work later
CB> plus, you loose liberties, and the result of this sequence will be that white can connect his stones... sad...]
;W[pg];B[pe]
(;W[og]C[CB> white should first play at Q12 to create weaknesses]
;B[ph];W[qg]
(;B[rf]C[CB> this is a yose move, and not the best - I would have ignored it as white]
;W[re];B[rg];W[rd]C[CB> now it is terrible because white is connected and doesn't have to search for eyes for his center stones!!!!]

(;B[fd]C[CB>no - don't play high if you want to build a base]

(;W[fc];B[gc]C[CB> dangerous...]
(;W[ed];B[fe];W[ee]
(;B[dg]LB[fe:A][ef:C][dg:B]C[CB> this is a bad shape (called the 'elephant's eye') - oh, by the way, your top group is not yet secure]

(;W[di]
(;B[ce]C[CB> I would first try to escape or connect];W[cf];B[df]
;W[cd]
(;B[be];W[bd];B[ch];W[ci]
(;B[bi];W[bj];B[bh]
(;W[fb];B[gb]
(;W[kd]C[CB> white could be more severe];B[kc];W[je];B[id];W[ld]
;B[lc];W[ka];B[kb];W[la];B[ja];W[jb];B[ia];W[ib];B[ha];W[hb]
;B[ga];W[hc];B[hd];W[mb]
(;B[no]LB[cj:A][dn:B]C[CB> that is big, but gote - only play such moves when you don't find something else to do. For instance, I would first try to exploit white's weaknesses, like finding a move which both awakes the shicho at A and the stone at B]
;W[ri]C[Now this, and all that follow it, are the reason I'm submitting this.

CB> I hope you already found some interesting things in the commentary! ;-)

 I'm unfamiliar with this kind of attack. At first it seemed doomed, but you can clearly see that it wasn't.

What is White's aim here? Capture, reduction, invasion? Given white's aim, what kind of responses should black make?

CB> white is just jealous of your territory here - there are two approaches:
 - give up the two stones
 - save the two stones and try to kill white

Since you did not make many points on the upper side, you are probably already behind, so I would opt for the second choice.]

(;B[rh];W[qj]C[CB> it's not easy for white... I've got the feeling you should be able to kill him]

(;B[pj]C[CB> try to enclose white - and, a quite general remark: quite often, with invasions, it is good to avoid contact moves. Plus, since your wall is strong, you can play further.]
;W[qk];B[rl]C[CB> no: try first to enclose white - he may not be able to do eyes inside, and even if he manages to do so he will make only two points gote, and you will be strong on the outside

CB> but I think you can still kill white];W[pk];B[ok]C[CB> that's why Q9 was better than Q10...]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[ol];B[nk];W[pm]
(;B[qm]C[Here you can see I'm focused too much on making sure W cannot live, and so I let him get out.

CB> This move is not necessary!];W[nl];B[ml];W[mk];B[nj];W[mj]

(;B[lm];W[li]C[CB> ouch...]
(;B[op];W[np];B[jp];W[jq]
(;B[kp]C[And this should have been at J4. By now the game is over.

CB> I'll stop here... good bye.];W[ip];B[io];W[iq];B[jn];W[lp]
;B[lo];W[jl];B[jm];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn]C[Youngmin [9k?\]: ty
Bluebottle [10k\]: thanks for the game

So in general, the game was relatively even before the invasion on the right, when I lost everything.

CB> you both missed big opportunities... and there are some basic principles of play you didn't apply:
 - make plans, don't change your mind
 - play urgent and threatening moves before playing gote moves even if they are big
 - play in big areas first
 - don't play yose moves in the middle game
 - don't try to cut when it doesn't work, you'll loose liberties and later opportunities
 - play solid moves when you want to build a base
 - when invading, try to escape first before trying to live inside
 - when invaded, first try to enclose the opponent
 - and play good shapes !

Thanks again for your review.])
