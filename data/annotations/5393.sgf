C[Dear reviewer,

In this game I played black and lost by quite big marginal, which was to be expected since the opponent was so much stronger. I'd be very grateful for any advice on my game. Thank you for taking the time to review my game!

----------------------------

Hi!

This was an interesting game :)

I commented it up to move 126. If you take a close look at the position at that point, you will notice that both sides have four groups, but  White has more territory. So, Whites play was more effektive.... In the commentary, I try to find the reasons for this. But, in short, I think you played too many moves from the direction of already strong and secure positions.

Ok, lets start :)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]C[In this kind of situation I've seen many high dans play around F3 instead of D15, but don't know which is better. I feel D17 gives nice room for an intrusion, but should I first play around F3 and leave D15 (or the like) for later?

-------------------

Please ask such questions the high dans, then ;)

But if you check this positions with the databases, you will find that many professionals play d15, too.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]LB[ch:C][ek:B][cm:A]C[Was this choise of joseki correct? I'm not entirely satisfied that this leaves white C7 (which I suppose is sente) and thus gives him a very big corner. Should I have played the avalance joseki (or something else) here instead? Supposing white plays C7 here, what should black do? It seems sente to me, but I cannot find a good local move.

----------------

The joseki is perfekt fine. If White A, you can play Black B oder leave the position as it is. White can invade at C then, but this is okay for Black. This is a well known middlegame joseki.]
;W[qn];B[pk]LB[qk:C][cm:A][cn:D][qp:B]C[If you don't like a white stone at A, how about Black B, White C, Black D instead?!]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op];B[qo];W[rr];B[oo]
LB[pn:A]C[Is this push stupid? I've seen some high dans leave the situation as it is, but to me it seems there's too much aji left from R6 and needs one more stone.

---------------

White gains to much from this push. If you want to add a stone here, Black A looks better.]
;W[np];B[od]LB[oc:A][cn:B]C[I would prefer to wait for a white move here or at A. Then Black can use the play there to secure the right side. In the game, even with the shimari, the right side is wide open... So,  Black B again?!]
;W[qi];B[rk]LB[oj:A][rp:B]C[I spent considerable time thinking about this move, but the result is not entirely satisfiable to me. I was thinking of P11 or Q11, but it seemed white can cause much trouble (by using R6 aji) if I leave the side open.

--------------------------

Black A!! Thinking of the big white move at B, defending territory here seems very small.]
;W[oi];B[nk]C[This again seems too slow. Perhaps O10 would have been better (if there's need to play in this area at all?)

---------------------

Yes , O10 looks more attraktive.];W[mi];B[lc];W[cm]C[Here it comes. Don't know what would be the best response here.]
;B[ej]LB[ek:A]C[As mentioned, Black A is better.];W[eq];B[lk]
C[Again slow (I think). I wanted to get a bit more influence in the middle before invading on the lower side.

---------------------

Can't be bad, either :)];W[ki];B[ip]C[Is this invasion point good or bad?]
;W[kp];B[jq]LB[co:D][no:B][mp:C][gq:A]TR[kp]C[Bad, I think. Black A should be better?! Once White played the marked stone, the push at B, threatening C, is also an idea.

One last idea is to invade at D.];W[kq];B[gq];W[no];B[om]LB[ic:C]
[nn:A][co:B]C[Better at A.];W[ef];B[eg]LB[ek:A]TR[ej]C[This was a misread/mistake. Should have played D14 here?

------------

The move you played would have been more effektive with the marked stone at A, but it is one way to answer the white peep.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[df];B[cg];W[ff];B[bl]LB[co:A]C[This is bad, I think, Black plays an endgame move from a very, very strong position...  Why not invading at A?!]
;W[bm];B[fr];W[er]C[This time, the endgame is from a weak position and therefore ok, but it's a pity to lose the invasion.]
;B[jr]LB[ic:A][qg:B]C[Black A  is better. Black B, too :)];W[kr]
;B[ic]C[Very big move!];W[qf];B[re]LB[gb:A]TR[rk]C[Just as an endgame move, A is bigger...

The marked stone makes the right side uninteresting.];W[ld]
;B[mc];W[pe];B[oe]C[Good!];W[of];B[nf];W[ng];B[og];W[pf];B[mg]
;W[nh];B[ne];W[pd];B[pc];W[rf];B[qc]LB[oc:B][qc:C][rc:D][lf:A]
TR[ne][oe][nf][mg][og]C[Not very logical?! With the marked stones, you said "I want to play in the center", and now you defend the corner. How about Black A instead? If Whie cuts at B then, you can still defend at C. Of course, White D is a possible endgame move then :)]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[cl];B[bk]LB[gb:A]C[To small again. Better taking sente and playing A.]
;W[hb]C[Very big at this stage of the game.];B[ib];W[hc];B[kd]
LB[ie:A]C[Small, too near to your secure stones. Black A?!]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[go];B[ek];W[rp]C[Sigh....];B[ro];W[sq];B[es]
;W[ds];B[fs];W[cr];B[ks];W[ls];B[js];W[mr];B[am];W[an];B[al]
;W[cn];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[gc];B[kf]LB[be:A]C[Better at A.]
;W[ae];B[ag];W[hr];B[hq];W[so];B[rn];W[fq];B[gr];W[id];B[jd]
;W[ie];B[dl]LB[em:A]C[Black A is bigger.];W[em];B[si];W[rh]
;B[nn]LB[ln:B][lo:A]C[How about Black A or B? After the game move, White makes as much territory as Black...]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ln]C[Lets count here...

White:

20 points in the lower left
30 points in the upper left
7 points on the right
23 points in the lower right

all together 80 points

Black:

32 points at the upper side
13 points at the left
6 points at the bottom
14 pints at the right

All in all 65 points

I am not good at counting, but I think, even without komi, White is quite some points ahead here. So I quit the commentary here...

Good luck for your next games :)];B[gl];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn];B[fm]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[lm];B[gm];W[en];B[ll]C[This is a mistake I think. F12 (or the like) must be bigger.]
