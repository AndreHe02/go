C[Hello,

in this game I'm black and I won this game by 0,5points. But I didn't earned it, because I was only lucky my opponend made a mistake by letting me captuere some of his cutting stones (otherwise he would be the winner).
I'm asking for a review of this game, because first of all everything looked great for me, but then suddenly it changed and it was the worst.

Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS.

I will start my comments with "W:"];B[pd];W[dq];B[dc];W[pq]
;B[do];W[cp]C[First of all, I really didn't know how to response here... Because this move seemed weird to me...
What is the proper move here?

---

W: White's move feels "odd" because it's not a joseki move.]
;B[co]C[W: This is absolutely the best response, there's no question about that.]
;W[fq];B[dk];W[cf]LB[cd:A][ch:B]C[Here I don't know from which side i should attack the white Stone.
On the one hand I could secure the corner but there is a weak point in my formation in the lower left.
On the other hand I could attack from the bottom and help my group there but my Stone at the top is not that strong right now.

---

W: Attack from the side where you expect to make points or useful influence. There are only two logical options, A and B.]

(;B[ch]C[W: This is again without a doubt, the best move.];W[cd]
;B[cc]C[I know, it's not good to attach to the Stones you want to attack but here it seemd necessary, or would an other move be better?

---

W: Again you played the perfect move. If Black would not have played here, White would have received two eyes by playing any move in the corner and Black would not have been able to gain further influence or points by attacking the weak White group.

Black is making points on the left and at the top, while White is still struggling to live, and each of Whites moves are not making any points. It's like he's filling dame (points of no value) points.]

;W[fc];B[jd];W[kb]
(;B[jc];W[jb]C[Here I felt very well! I'm kinda alive in the corner and my opponend got to Groups. One is bearly alive and the other is on the run...

W: Well since you're out in the open with a large group which the opponent has no chance of surrounding, the eyes in the corner don't matter. :-)]

;W[ig];B[jf]

W: In Go both players make mistakes, and the one who makes less or smaller mistakes wins. :-)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1FvPxmmfE don't forget that even 9 dan professional players make mistakes - he was about to win the game after the dame points would have been filled!

Your game was a lot of fun, but it was very difficult to find things to say, mainly because the entire game was about the White group on the left escaping to the bottom.

===

All in all you wanted to get everything without letting your opponent have anything. This is not logical. Before and during the game you should be mentally prepared to accept that both of you can get 50% of the board, and aim to get that extra 0.1% required to win the game by simply playing better moves.

If you had protected your own weaknesses before attacking your opponent, you would have found a comfortable win.

You should not try to kill a group, it should be impossible. Only when you are over 100% certain you can capture or kill (you have visualised the moves from the beginning to the end in your head, not missing any variations or good counter moves by your opponent), only then should you go for the kill.

Of course you can attack a weak group of your opponent, provided you do not have weak groups or you do not leave weaknesses behind.

Nothing is worse in go than a failed attack (you do not gain anything by attacking, and your opponent only becomes stronger while you get weaker).

The game has ended, it's time to take a good look at the board. There are three of your groups that have been captured by your opponent. Surely you could have done something to protect them earlier?

I hope this helped! :-)])

(;B[mi]TR[if][ig][jg][kg]C[W: Since the White group on the left is absolutely alive, it would be best to switch the attack to White's four cutting stones on this side. Capturing them is not small.

A move such as N11 which attacks and defends at the same time is really effective. If your move has more than one meaning, it is a good move for sure.]

Black has a larger corner.

Black has less territory on the left
White has a stronger group on the left.
