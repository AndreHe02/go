AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[*jimwalsh3*: Hi!



**Hey Big, so I'll do my best to provide advice as you :D  My level is roughly 11-13k depending on how recently I've played (it's been awhile recently :c) so my advice is only meant to be observations from someone of that level.  If I were to play Jimwaish3, I'd be demolished too T.T) Having said that, on to the review!**]
;W[nq]C[*jimwalsh3*: hi]
(;B[np]LB[mp:A]C[*jimwalsh3*: enjoy

**I don't think this is a bad move but I also don' think it's optimal.  A better might be at A.  The reason being is that it gives you more even control of the space.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lo];B[lp];W[mq]LB[lo:B][no:D][op:C][lq:A]TR[mp]
[nq]SQ[mo][jp][lp][np][pp]C[**So a couple things here.  The situation you're in right now is a bit tenius.  The reason is that the triangle group is a solid group that's surrounded by very a flimsy barrier of black stones.  If you look at your stones (the squares), note all the different ways he can attack without danger to himself.  This isn't the worst situation in the world but it doesn't leave you in a very comfortable spot.  He isn't completely safe himself but he's at least able to start exploiting weakenesses in your structure, which he does.  But let's look at the next move which is where I think there's some room for a couple alternatives**]
(;B[lq]LB[no:A][kp:1]TR[mo][np]SQ[lp]C[**Now it's true that you've protected the square stone but the triangles are still just as vulnerable.  In fact, they're more vulnerable.  He chose to only pressure one stone but if he'd played at A he could have pressured both and you would have absolutely lost one.**

**The first move I suggest @1 isn't necessarily ideal but it addresses another weakness in the move you made.  What you did was logical and solves the immediate problem but it doesn't set you up to go anywhere.  Generally, you want to have as many spaces in between two pieces of a wall as the wall is high +1.  ie. if you have a two stone wall, which you create with this move, for you to maximize it's effectiveness, you'd want to have the other side of your wall be 3 stones away.  The fact that your's is one means that you're only hurting yourself.  I'll talk a little bit in the actual example about what you can do with this alternate move**]
;W[op];B[no];W[pq];B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[oq]C[**Nice sequence, you respond correctly ( at least from a 13k perspective) to each of those attacks of openings in the last 4 moves or so**]
;B[pn];W[ko];B[jo]LB[ho:A][hp:B]C[**Given the map, this isn't a bad move and it makes sense, try to cute white off, but given how much of the map is still open and how much influence you still have (since you have stones everywhere), you can be a little wider with your moves.  The two suggestions, A and B, aren't huge leaps but still give you a little more play room than the current move without suddenly making you incredibly vulnerable.**]
;W[lm]
(;B[ln]LB[nn:A]TR[lm][ko][lo][oo][mp][op][mq][nq][oq]C[**I see what you're trying to do here and it makes sense but if you lookat teh surrounding stones, doing this puts you in a bad position.  You see this in two moves.**

**Placing it at A doesn't do a lot to stall your opponent but it keeps your group of three safe and in so doing, protects everything else.**]
;W[kn];B[mn];W[mm]
(;B[km]LB[nn:A]C[**So you see that right here, where you end up in this situation where you have a lot of stones but you don't have any eyes.  If you compare your situations, he needs 1 stone to take all of yours and you need 3 (2 with your move right now) so trying to take out his group of three on the left won't work.  If we try A...**]
;W[nn];B[fe]LB[kl:B][nl:C][jm:A]C[**So I think the reason you went here is that you weren't sure where else to go.  It has that sort of feel to it, you've just completed a sequence and you're not sure where you should put your attention next.**

**I'm not a huge fan of this move unless you're looking very far ahead into the game and setting yourself up.  But even given that, you've got more immeidate threats to deal with.  That's why I think A /B/C would be more useful in securing your position.  Where you placed the stone in this move, it doesn't really add anything; it isn't locking down an area or threatening white at all.  A/B are securing your own stones while C is cutting off some of white's influence.**]
;W[jn]
(;B[kp]SQ[jo][jp][lp][lq]C[**This was a good move.  I don't think it was absolutely necessary but you're making sure that white can't split your two groups.**

**The alternate path is just exploring what might happen if you don't connect the groups **]
;W[fp]
(;B[en]TR[jn][kn][ko][lo][fp][mp][mq]SQ[jo][jp][kp][lp][lq]
TW[ln][mn][mo][no][np]C[**This move doesn't do as much as it could.  White's triangle stones are not threatening your square group.  The move you made doesn't really help protect that square group.**

**Alternative path has a couple other options for trying to protect that group**]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[hn]TR[fn][jn][kn][ko][lo][fp][mp][mq]C[**So this was my concern with the move on 30, that white would split your groups and make it harder to survive.  If you look at the triangle stones, you see the way they make a net, not only separate the group on the bottom-left from the bottom-center but also surrounding the bottom-left.**]
;B[gl]LB[fk:B][fl:A]TR[fn][hn]TW[ln][mn][mo][no][np]C[**I think rather than try to stop white from moving north, you want to still find a way to connect your lower-left and middle-left groups together.  If you do want to shift gears to cut off the white stones, A/B are more likely than where you placed your stone.**

**The reason these are more common and the place you moved is less common is that white wants to gain as much territory as possible.  Moving where your black stone was placed would cut down on white's influence.  White can still be just as safe at A/B but secure greater influence.**]
;W[fm];B[fl]C[**This is a good move.  You see that white is trying to move north so you cut white off**]
;W[em]
(;B[el]LB[dm:A]C[**So this is a logical move as well but I think there's a better place to play.  What this does is prevent white from going north.  The thing is though, you've got a looot of influence up north so white moving north isn't as bad as white securing a side (bottom left corner).  So I would suggest A because you keep control of the left side.  THe alternate path highlights some of the strengths of moving at A**]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dn];B[cn];W[do];B[co];W[ep];B[dl]SQ[en][eo]C[**This was smart.  Cut your losses with the square group.  You can't save them so do what you can to box white in**]
;W[iq];B[cl]LB[kl:B][nl:C][dr:A]SQ[dj][dl][el][fl][gl][cm][cn]
[co]C[**This is a sensible move but much too early.  Your square stones reveal that you're not in any immediate danger.  That's quite a secure location.  It's better to play bigger, broader.  

A: you try to secure the bottom right.

B: You try to keep that stone alive and start securing the upper half of the board.

C: You try to do something similar to B but with a bigger focus on the right side**]
;W[qf];B[ee]LB[qd:D][pf:E][dg:A][jg:B][qh:C]C[**So this move is simliiar to the move stone right next to it.  White is posturing in the upper right, threatening you and trying to establish himself.  This move by you doesn't try to punish white for jumping into your influence.  It's also too small of a move to secure the upper left.

A/B would have been securing the upper left in a more effective way (if that was your intent).  

C/D/E are ways you could have responded to white.  D blocks white off from trying to get the right corner.  E tries to force white onto the right edge and not allow him to have a lot of space to maneuver.  C is about trying to prevent white from joining up with the group in the lower right (more about denying space to white but preventing the two groups from joining up is what distinguishes C from D/E**]
;W[of];B[pe]LB[md:A][pf:1][pg:C][mj:B]SQ[jd][pd][jj][pj]TW[ln]
[mn][mo][no][np]C[**So white is clearly trying to get into the center of the map.  Trying to get himself space to work with.  You've got these square pillars that form a lot of influence. Instead of playing so close to your chest, play a little more open and utilize the strong influence of the stones you have on the board.

A: You don't want to let white cut off the upper right corner so you're soldifying your power up top.  It also gives you another stone to use to cut into the white group.

B: You don't want the two groups to connect so you're cutting off access and trying to force white to play in the territory where you have the advantage

C: You've got such a large influence in this area that you can go on the offensive.  C is about force white to respond with 1 and then allowing yourself to take the initiative.**]
;W[pf];B[od]LB[md:A][kf:B]C[**Same principle as last move.  You've got a lot of stones in the area.  Playing such a small move doesn't allow you to utilize the surrounding stones.

A: Does the same thing that your move does but gives you a stronger influence because you've got two smaller gaps to deal with.  As opposed to one giant gap between your stones.

B: Your two stones aren't in immediate danger so B is about trying to start cutting white off while also trying to set up a strong influence in the upper right**]
;W[pl];B[ne]LB[pl:A]C[**This is simliar to the last two moves but the move at A change what I'm going to say slightly.  A threatens your group in the lower right.  This is something you need to respond to or you're going to lose them.  By not responding, you're essentially giving that group up.  It's one thing if you ignore A to threaten another group but your move doesn't threaten or hinder white at all.  In essence, ignoring a move like A isn't always bad but if you're going to ignore it, you need to do some by putting pressure back on your opponent.**]
;W[mg];B[lg]LB[md:C][jg:B][mj:A]C[**This was a good move, trying to cut white off.  This would be much stronger with stones at A or B or C**]
;W[mf];B[me];W[lf];B[kf]LB[kg:A]SQ[lg]C[**While it's good to cut off your opponent when you can, you're making the square too vulnerable.  It's not a move that immediately threatens white, just tries to block it off.  But  by moving there, you give white the opportunity to start exploiting weakenesses

A would still let you limit white's options while protecting the square stone as well**]
;W[le];B[kg]LB[lh:A]C[**It's good that you saw this and it was a smart move to take care of it.  An alternative to this could have been A where you would have also eliminated the possibiliity of getting in a tight spot but you also would have limited white's ability to expand south.**]
;W[ld]
(;B[nd]LB[lc:A]SQ[od][ne]C[**This position, the diagnol (squares) is a position that you very rarely need to pre-emptively close.  No matter what white does, you can place a stone in the other spot.  Alternative path shows how.  So you were safe with this two stones and you could have cut white off at A.**]
;W[ik];B[ij]SQ[dj][jj][pj]C[**I like this because you're preventing white from moving north but you're also reinforcing this pseuo wall you've got in the works (squares)]
;W[hk];B[hj];W[gk]
(;B[fk]LB[dk:A]SQ[cl][dl][el][fl][gl]C[**Rather than play this here, I'd prefer to see it at A.  The reason being that you've got a strong back wall (squares) and you can force white to play to the left while also increasing your own wall right above him.  Alternate path has an example**]
;W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[hl]LB[fk:A]C[**So working off my last comment, because you stopped the wall at A, white's now splitting up your groups.**]
;W[jl]C[**These next two moves are an example of why you don't need to pre-emptively close off a diagnol connection (generally)**]
;B[il];W[jk];B[jm];W[im];B[in]C[**I see what you're going for but you're basically giving white a stone for no cost.  Even if you were trying to bait white into taking that stone so you could try to save the group of two next to it, I don't think it'd work.  Look at the alternate path for test**]
;W[io]
(;B[hm];W[kl];B[fo];W[go];B[hi];W[kj];B[mh];W[nh];B[ni];W[mi]
;B[li];W[lh];B[mj];W[mh];B[lj];W[ki];B[kh];W[nj]
(;B[mk]LB[nj:A][nk:1]C[**The A stone splits your groups and puts you in a dangerous position.  An alternative is to push at 1 and try to gain a little ground.**]
;W[oi]
(;B[lk]LB[nk:A]TR[lh][mi][nj][jk][jl][kl][pl][lm][mm]SQ[ki]
[kj]C[**Rather than try to hit the square group, I would say try to keep yourself alive.  The triangles show the influence white has around your group.  A might be a better alternative**

**I've spent an enormous amount of time on the early game.  I've got one or two comments farther on but otherwise I'm gonna leave it be because it becomes a much more reactionary game.   You set yourself up in the early game and then respond to the way you set yourself up so I wanted to focus on how you set yourself up for the mid/late game**]

;W[sk];B[sj];W[si];B[gh];W[fi];B[ei]C[**So this is another pseudo ladder where it looks like you're leading white but white's actually leading you.  White's group is quite safe so by letting you lead white on a ladder sequence, you end up with a lot of weakpoints that white later exploits**

**This is my last comment for now.  If there are any sequences later on that you don't understand how you could have done differently or feel like you botched but don't know why, I can certainly answer those.  Otherwise, feel free to contact me via email or skype:Arnfasta if you want the game further reviewed or you want a followup review :D glgl**]
