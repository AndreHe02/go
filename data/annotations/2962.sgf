;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[do];B[oc];W[qi]LB[po:A]C[Arend: The normal move here is at A.]
;B[qo]LB[jp:b][dq:a]C[7 makes the bottom a big area for black to play in but I couldn't find a good play there that I thought went well with 4. White A, black B is clearly good for black - can white play at B to build influence when black enters around A?

Arend: Yes it is difficult, but I think you still have to try to play in the bottom area. It would have been better to avoid that problem by playing an approach move with W5, however.]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[mc]LB[qk:c]C[I still couldn't find a decent way of playing around the bottom, so I ignored it and played 10 here. when black 11 induces white 12, it feels like an ok way to begin to reduce the bottom. If black extends up to C however, I would start to worry.

Arend: I think C and B11 are both good.]
(;B[qg];W[ql]LB[pj:A][qj:B][pl:C]C[Arend: Now black still has excellent potential for a moyo on the lower side with Black A - White B - Black C later.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er];W[ck]C[14-18 feels like an ok way to play. Black expands his moyo, but mine is big as well, albeit quite loose.]

(;B[cc]LB[cf:d]C[Not very surprising I suppose, but I wonder if black could have held back a little longer as white's moyo is still fairly loose. Alternatively how about coming in at D instead?

Arend: I think both is possible.];W[cd];B[bc]C[I'm not used to this move - i thought that the variation we played was good for white in comparison with the usual.
Arend: This is a big mistake.]
(;W[bd]C[Arend: Not severe enough, see variation.];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc]C[Arend: This result is a little better for White. It is important to get the double sente at A17, I think.]
;B[fp];W[fn]LB[ej:e][fj:A][ek:f]C[This is at the boundry of the 2 moyos but white's feels quite loose. Can white play at E or F say instead?

Arend: I think this move is good. If you want an alternative I would suggest A.]
;B[fg];W[dg];B[ek];W[di]C[black's 31 and 33 felt quite natural and good ways of limiting my moyo but I still have a good opportunity to attack them I feel]
;B[gn]LB[cm:B][fm:g][gm:A]C[I didn't really want to answer this at G because I thought that black's moyo would be too solid if black got any more moves in.

Arend: A move at g, or better at A, is
a) at the junction line between the two potential moyos
b) prevents black from linking up his weak stone at E9 to his strong base at F4
c) is almost reverse sente, as after a black move at g, the threat of a cut at B becomes serious.

In other words, there is no excuse for omitting it :-)]
(;W[pr]C[I think that this is too deep in retrospect. If black allows white to form the tripod group in the corner but takes the outside I think that is very big.

Arend: I think it is ok.]
(;B[or];W[oq]
(;B[qr]C[So this helps white i think
Arend: This is generally considered a little submissive. But I don't think the alternative is good for black here.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[nr];B[ps];W[kq]C[Being forced outside has helped white I think, but I've no real experience of playing lightly so this was just a guess really
Arend: It looks reasonable.];B[nq]LB[jq:A]C[Arend: I think black has to answer at A.]
;W[mq];B[np];W[mp];B[no]
(;W[ln]LB[mo:C][lr:B][mr:A]C[Arend: I think here you have to push as in the variation first. And M6 is bad shape, as you cannot answer A at B anymore. Hence C is better than the game move.]
;B[jq];W[rn]LB[kp:A]C[The 2 white stones were feeling a bit endangered, so I played this to stabilize them.
Arend: I think A is more urgent.];B[lr]LB[mr:A]C[Arend: A makes more sense if Black wants to play here.]
;W[nn]LB[kp:A]C[Arend: Nice idea, but I don't think it works well. Just A looks better.]
;B[mo];W[lo]
(;B[mr]LB[mn:A]C[Arend: I think Black has to cut at A first.]
;W[mn];B[pn];W[oo];B[ns];W[on]LB[pm:A][op:B]C[This doesn't seem to be very light play, but the stones are on the outside, and not far from connection to another group.
Arend: A seems better, as it safely connects your groups (possibly best after the kikashi at B).]
;B[pm];W[qp];B[ro];W[nk];B[pl];W[pk];B[kp]LB[rp:A]C[I now read the game as follows:

I count the two moyos as about even ~30 points each. Thus to win I'm going to have to genterate some terratory toward the centre and reduce the upper right further.

Arend: That's the wrong time to count territory. If you move at A, you have a very weak group to attack. So you should try to read out whether this fight will be good for you. If not, you probably should defend your cuts on the outside -- in sente, as black will have to play A himself then.

I think playing A will be good for you.];W[ol];B[rp];W[rd]LB[nd:A]
[oe:h][gm:B]C[This also looks to deep now. How about a move at H to reduce the corner and strengthen the white centre?
Arend: The black move at H13 is so big exactly because it makes it very hard for W to play at S16. I don't see White h achieving much if black moves out at A. The urgent move is still B.]
;B[re];W[qc]
(;B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[rb]LB[pc:A]C[Arend: This gives black a chance to correct his mistake. Play at A immediately.]

(;B[sd];W[pc]C[Once again black seems to have helped me out. The corner is gone and I now have potential for some real terratory along the top.
Assuming the 2 moyos are still about the same, black maybe slightly bigger, the komi is roughly the same as the top left and so white looks quite good here.

Arend: UR was a disaster for black. But he has sente to play in the LL, and since S4 his moyo has been larger than the white one. So white is leading, but black still has chances.]
;B[en]
(;W[eo];B[fo]C[This is big - the way i handle it is bad, but I how should i play - at I looks like it gives up a lot of ground to black.

;W[ao];B[bm]C[Up to 97 I should have left out, but I was try to see if there was any weakness to the 81,85,87 stones.
I count the bottom as 55+ points for black, versus 18 on the left for white - a lot of ground to make up.
I manage to start a decent fight in the centre, but I'm always struggling from here

Arend: Well, I think it was rather black who (unneccessarily) started the fights :-)]
