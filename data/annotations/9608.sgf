C[Hi!  My name is Jared and I play black in this game that I played with my friend on OGS (a correspondence server).  I'm a 3k on KGS and I seem to have hit some sort of wall in terms of my understanding of Go.

I wouldn't mind some comments about joseki choice, positional judgment, and the opening in general.  I've tried some variations in this .sgf file, but it's still not exactly clear to me what is considered "good" or "favorable" just by looking at the opening.

What it comes down to is that I don't have a good feel for the opening, and I'd like to refine my intuition.

Thanks for any comments!

Hello, Jared!

I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and other go places. 

When I first looked at this game, I thought: "Wow, what's going on here?" 

We all share this fuzziness about the fuseki, it is not easy to judge. But I will try to share what I "know". And then it's suddenly all about the big fighting anyway, right? ;-)

Let's go!];B[oc];W[pp];B[dp];W[cd];B[ed]C[Hon: I think, this approach is good. 

According to conventional fuseki theory, we play first in the corners where there is an assymetrical situation - a 3-4, 4-5 or 4-5 stone, either by making a shimari or by preventing one. (Especially this is true for 3-4 - with the other points we have to ponder a bit, if we are giving away too much influence, so it also becomes a matter of timing.) Main reason for this: only one move more would take the corner territory for good. Either you prevent that now - or maybe never.

Direction also plays a role. Your stone at P17 stresses the upper side, so by approaching C16, you kill two birds with one stone - preventing a shimari AND extending where you want to go.]
;W[ec]
(;B[dd]C[Dubious, maybe.

Hon: I agree. It is a bit hard to say if it's really bad, but ... well, from what we said about your upper right, a block at F17 (like in your variation) seems more logical.]
;W[dc];B[ce]C[jrhoak: avalanche!];W[fc]C[jarstar: The large avalanche, too.  Let the record show that this was *your* choice :D

Hon: Your opponent makes an important point here!

The avalanche is a complicated, dangerous joseki; you should only play it after you studied it thoroughly! (At least in a serious game, which you want to win.]

(;B[fd]C[jrhoak: guh];W[gd]
(;B[ge]C[jrhoak: hm
jrhoak: I don't know this variation-
jrhoak: fwiw
jrhoak: ...
jrhoak: This is the most common variation now-adays in this position
jrhoak: var. From move 10: B16 C17 D14];W[be]C[jarstar: Hmm.  I actually... didn't mean to do that

Hon. So ... why did you? :-)];B[cc];W[bd]C[jarstar: This is interesting though]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[he];W[id];B[cf];W[cb];B[ie];W[jd]C[Hon: Okay, this sequence turned out really bad for you.

You not only gave White the corner, but also the upper edge - and on the 4th line! This alone is already disagreeable, but this also harms the potential of your 5-3 stone. You almost have to make a shimari now so that your corner still makes sense.

And what have you got? A wall with a certain liberty problem, which is "open at the bottom" (B14), making it hard to use.]

(;B[nq];W[jp]
(;B[qn]C[Wrong direction?

Hon: You have no other direction really, unless you want to enter the corner directly.]

(;W[np]C[Hon: I don't agree with this move.];B[mp];W[no]
(;B[pq]C[Hon: In this situation, the attachment looks right.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[mr]
(;W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[qq];W[qp]C[Hon: This choice of joseki was not good for White. He gets a wall in gote towards an empty side.

So what will you do? Neutralize this influence directly!]
(;B[qd];W[qj]C[Hon: White's Wall saves face.];B[qh]
(;W[ph]C[Hon: This does not look good. White strengthens Black, before defending himself. 

Good technique is strengthen yourself, while threatening the opponent.]

(;B[qk]C[jrhoak: huh
jrhoak: didn't expcet th
jrhoak: didn't expect that

Hon: Surprising for me as well - but I see what you want to do. Live here anyway, since White didn't kill rightaway, and make the wall useless.]

(;W[pj]C[jarstar: Hm.  I feel kinda behind in territory after the upper left

Hon: You were earlier. If you can live away White's potential here, you seem to be in the game again - but usually, living in front of a wall like this has consequences.]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[qi];B[om];W[fq]C[Hon: I am not sure about this move ...

I would rather approach from the other side or split the left side. 

I suppose White wanted to defend his wall which suddenly became weakish ... it may be the right impulse ... but even after this approach there is bad aji (e. g. cut at L5).

The situation in the lower right was just too bad for White (like the situation in the upper left was just too bad for Black before).]

(;B[cn];W[ef]C[jarstar: The vital point!
jrhoak: thar point!
jarstar: This is very galling

Hon: I think, this is maybe a bit too direct. Black has lots of space still. But it is a good spot shapewise ...]

(;B[fe];W[cg]C[jarstar: Good move.  I wanted C13, but the F15 cut seemed more important
jarstar: C12, even];B[bf];W[eg]C[jarstar: This is probably dangerous]

(;B[bg]C[jrhoak: not yet, I think

Hon: Pushes like that are very nice towards the opponent.

What do you get by pushing? To be sure of an eye at the edge, you'd have to push again and again, making White stronger in the process.]

(;B[nl]C[Perhaps slow.  I wanted to get into the center and protect my weak group at the same time.

jarstar: Fair enough.  Not much eye space :)];B[sk];W[sg];B[sj]

(;W[oi]C[Hon: Do you see, how Black P9 would look better now? It would even threaten White's eyeshape! Instead now, White can aim at D8.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[pf]C[Hon: In hindsight, White would be better off just throwing away these stones now.]

(;W[pe];B[of];W[oe];B[nf]C[jarstar: There will be no peace

(;W[kk];B[hm];W[ij];B[hi]C[jrhoak: nothing now

White resigned here.  I think it's because black is now alive, and there is the threat at G4 to worry about.  Then black will have sente to begin the big endgame points (N18 and L3).  Black has a 10(ish) point lead.

Hon: Are the two of you alive? You probably read out all of this ...]

Well ... this was a fighty game, I really am not sure if I have got everything right. I hope, my views on this helped anyway. 

The fuseki on the other hand was just characterized by two big joseki mistakes - Black in the upper left and White in the lower right. After that, the game was probably about even again.

Anyway, you probably see, that this move would fit better, if your P17 stone was a hoshi instead (or the 5-3 on the other side of the corner, if you like). So here we get another example for why P17 is biased and should be developed early according to his inherent "desires".]

Your 5-3 in the upper right has made territory in the direction where he wanted to go.]
))
(;B[bd]C[Hon: This is played rather often right now.];W[cc]
;B[cj]C[Hon: With a sequence like this you treat your stones up there rather lightly and use them to increase your moyo potential on the left side.

Of course there are a lot of variations which you can check yourself, for example at www.eidogo.com, but I think, this is one logical way to go, since your hoshi down left wants to develop towards the sides.

Anyway, your hoshi would be fine to take the lower side instead - he is rather flexible! (This is by the way one reason why we don't hurry to approach a hoshi stone - we first want to know which side is better. The other reason is that a hoshi stone can't enclose territory directly anyway.)

But now look at your stone in the upper right! While your hoshi down left didn't mind taking either the left or the lower side, your 5-3 had a "clear preference" - the upper side. But there, the potential of growth is limited now, because White has a solid, stable, low, living, unattackable group in the upper left.

(Again: It's hard to say - at least for me - that it is "bad" - but maybe you understand my doubts and the reasoning.)]
