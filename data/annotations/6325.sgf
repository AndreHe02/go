Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'll be your reviewer today :)  I'm 3k AGA.  If you have any questions about the review, you can mail me at timkington@gmail.com]

;W[ec];B[qi];W[dj]LB[jq:a]C[A is a better point.  The corner positions on the left have a primary and secondary direction for develpoment.  The one at the top develops best down the left side, and the one at the bottom develops best along the bottom.  The position on the bottom right also develops best along the bottom.  So A is in the direction that both Black and White want.  The move at 10 is not as good because it doesn't work as well with the stones below.  Also it's on the fourth line, while the rest of your stones are on the third, so it's going to be hard to get a structure going in the center.]

;B[io];W[hp];B[ho];W[go]LB[gp:a]C[This isn't really a good idea - you're bending against stronger stones.  You should back off at A.  I realize you don't want Black getting into the potential area to the left, but he can anyway.  See the variaition.]
;B[gp];W[hq]
(;B[gq];W[fo]C[Luckily, Black screws this up, and gives you some stones.]
;B[ip];W[hr];B[gr];W[jr];B[kp];W[fr];B[kq];W[fp];B[kr];W[je]
C[Good.  You can't just let Black have this giant space to the right.  It's about time you did something about it.]
;B[ie];W[me];B[ke]C[Here Black gets distracted by your single stone.  You took the right approach - letting it go and making life in Black's moyo.  Black should have gotten a lot more out of this next sequence, but he wasted moves capturing the stone.]

;W[pe]C[Nice job.  Now you're alive.];B[rc]LB[ge:a][cg:b]C[And you lived in sente - this is HUGE!  Now you can take another big point.]
;W[ge];B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[lh]LB[hh:a][hi:b][cg:c][oe:d][nf:e]
C[Your focus here should be to make life.  If you really try, you might make 6 points here.  If you make eyes only, you'll get two.  The difference is small, so it's not worth spending moves to try to make more space.  You already have eyes at D and E, so you should leave and take a big point.  You're a little thin around A and B, or you might play something like C.]
;B[kj];W[mj]C[Again, you should ignore Black's move.];B[ni]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[pg]C[That's three times now.  If you play even two of these moves on the left side, you have an easy win.]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[qh];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[ic];W[hd];B[ja];W[hb]
C[Up to this point I thought that I'm winning. What was wrong in my play later? What could I do better?

You are definitely winning.  You should have taken a bigger point instead of this sequence at the top, but you're still doing fine.  Black has about 33 in the upper right and 60 or so in the lower right.  You have about 30 in the lower left and potential for around 85 on the left, and you have 6 in the right center.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[gj];W[hh];B[hk];W[ii];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[ej]
C[Good - you don't need to be greedy here.];B[fm];W[dm];B[en]
;W[eo];B[dn];W[cn];B[do];W[dp];B[gn]
(;W[fn]C[This is a big mistake.  You have to take gote here because you've shortened your own liberties.  See variation.]
;B[em];W[fq];B[dl]C[This lets Black ruin more of your potential territory.]
;W[hn]LB[cm:a]C[You should probably just defend at A.];B[gm]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[hi];B[cm];W[il]C[This doesn't really threaten anything.]
;B[im]C[Luckily Black answers.]
(;W[bm]LB[ck:a]C[This is really from the wrong side.  A would be a lot better.
 With A you lose a little bit of space below, but keep everything above.  See variation.]
;B[bl];W[an];B[bj]C[Now Black starts eating the territory above.]

(;W[ck]LB[ci:a]C[You probably have to back up to A at this point.  See variation.  At this point your territory above is going to shrink quite a bit.]
;B[cl];W[bk];B[ak]
(;W[fg]LB[al:a]C[This is off the mark.  You don't have any problems here.  What you need to do is try to block Black out of the territory here.  See variations.  You can also start a ko at A to try to cut him off.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[ch]C[At this point, you're behind in the game.  You need something big now.]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[dh];B[cg];W[el];B[ek]
(;W[mn]LB[qp:a]C[This is the right idea, but the wrong point.  A might work.  See variation.  You should probably start the ko on the left, and then use moves in here as ko threats.  You'll wind up having a lot of big ko threats that way.]
;B[jl];W[on]C[Free move.  This gives you a chance.];B[dg]C[Wow, another free move.  You should not answer this.  Now you can probably live in Black's area.]
;W[di]C[This is worth a couple of points.  Living in Black's area is worth more than 30.]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[eg]C[Again, you can ignore Black.  As long as you keep your stones around here connected, you don't have to worry.  You aren't going to get many points around here anyway.]

I didn't really like the opening in this game, but that's mostly a matter of style - I would much rather break the board up than have a giant moyo.

I saw two big problems for White in this game.  The first is paying attention to sente.  When Black plays a move that doesn't have a big follow-up, you need to play elsewhere.  There were several places where you could have taken very large moves instead of answering Black.  The other big problem was blocking on the wrong side when Black started to push toward the left edge.  If you block from above, your corner might get 5 or even 10 points smaller.  Blocking from below cost you around 35 or so.]

(;B[po]C[Black can resist more severely, and you probably die, but this invasion is still worth a shot.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[op];B[nn]C[As long as Black isn't too aggressive, you're going to have a really hard time living here.]
