C[Review by John Rae 5kyu KGS


White lost this game early on through wrong directions in the opening stages. I advise taking a bit more time over these early moves and thinking them through a little more.

Black let white off many times by giving up sente for no good reason. Its worth reviewing  these points in the game. If you learn to take sente and give it away less it will make a big difference to your game.

Finally pay a little more attention to weak shapes and weak walls. White often played the wrong direction because of an incorrect understanding of what was weak and what was strong. This is not easy to learn but will come with practice.]

C[JR:

I'm not keen on D15 - or rather I'm not keen on the way you follow it through.

The marked stone was played with an emphasis on the top side - white expects black to play R16 or similar and to develop influence to the left in response.

So when white plays D15 the logical intention (hope) is that when black attaches at C15 to take the corner territroy white will play a joseki that gives influene towards the right - thus forming a large moyo.]

(;B[pd]C[JR : Not what I'd have expected, its neither one thing or the other - white has easy replies]

(;W[md]C[JR: But this is not one of the better replies :(]
(;B[ce]C[JR: Perfectly Ok but I think black's altenative is much better.]

(;W[cf]C[JR: The earlier moves in the top right suggest the alternative route in order to develop the top]

(;B[df]C[JR: rather ambitious by black]
(;W[cg]C[JR: Its the right idea to extend from the cross cut. I prefer the other extension]
;B[ee]C[JR That stone is now dead and there's not really a good way to use it.]

(;W[dd]C[JR This is  bad. It loses a stone, and loses the option of playing atari at B15]
;B[cd]
(;W[ef]C[JR: Again i think the wrong atarti - this hurts white, it forces black to play D13 - reducing the liberties of the 2 stones.]
;B[dg]
(;W[ci]C[JR My instinct would always be to hane at the head of 2 stones. Especially since its atari, white has 2 forcing moves to use to run.

Also white has E16, Black worries about this next move but I don't think its as good for white]
;B[ed]C[JR Black worries about E16 but it might not have been necessary. Certainly this gives white sente to escape.]
;W[cj]C[JR:

Nice idea to make sure you thoroughly break into black's position]
;B[ch]
(;W[dh]C[JR This gives up 2 stones, better to atari from the other side]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[bf];W[ah]C[Jr Not needed and a bit small at this stage,

Black should ignore this, let you have the 2 stones back , and play a bigger move instead. (see next move.)]

(;B[bg]C[JR This mistake lets white off. Black has bigger moves, Q17 is the best of them.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[dm];B[cn]
(;W[bm]C[JR C7 seems more solid];B[bn]C[JR This is why C7 was more solid - black now threatens to push through the gap]
;W[cm]C[JR Which means white defends and accepts gote.]
(;B[dn]C[JR Another let off. Black does not need to do this. It does not attack anything and is not needed to defend.]
;W[jq];B[pj];W[pl];B[og]C[JR Black is a litle ambitious here, all his stones are high.]
;W[qg]C[JR A nice invasion. Black is too high to play this shape.

 If white were stronger outside it would be really severe. Therefore it might have been worth strengtheing the outside first.]
;B[qf];W[ph];B[pg];W[qi]
(;B[jc];W[lc];B[pb];W[mf]
(;B[qq]C[JR I think this is a bit early. Not a bad move though.

I think black would have been better to play with the intention of building up an attack on the weak white group on the top]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rp];W[qr]C[Jr Simpler to  just play S4 as standard.]
;B[pr];W[rq];B[rr];W[ro];B[sq];W[fq]C[JR This is leaving a weak point behind R6 would be more normal.]

;W[ge];B[ha];W[jb];B[ib]CR[dj][ej][el][em]C[JR small end game move. The marked black group has no eyes and is adrift in a large white moyo.

Given that white has lost all 4 corners it is essential to make this moyo work. If it were very solid the game would be won, but it is not solid.]
