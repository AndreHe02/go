C[Imoto (~6 kyu) VS Bahamut1 (6 kyu)

Result: S+29.5

Time: 25 Minutes (1 Minute Byo-Yomi)

-------------

Hi, my name is Imoto and at first I
would like to thank you for reviewing my game.

In this game I try a lot of new moves, but
unfortunately it didn't worked well as
you can see on the result.

You only have to comment the moves for white (this was me) and
only the moves I commented.
But if you see a really big mistake which I didn't commented
feel free to say something about.

Thanks a lot.

DC: Hello Imoto,
I made many detailed comments throughout the game, and here I'll write the general weaknesses I've noticed:

* There is a tendency to create weak shape (for example moves 6 and 44, and others too) and leaving too much aji for the opponent to take advantage of. Sometimes a smaller move is safer and can save you the need of reinforcing the group with more moves later on. This helps create strong groups and to preserve sente during the game.

* Throughout the game, White was rather submissive, and sometimes let Black have his way. Black in this game was especially 'forcing' so I can't say if this is a constant problem. For example, moves 14 and 40.

* In the endgame White lost many points because he played small gote moves. It may not seem so at start, but good endgame can make immense differences in terms of points. The difference can reach tens of points, which is a lot, so always stay focused and ask yourself on any move your opponent plays "do I have to answer?".]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[jj]C[Due to b isn't a professional  I think this was a mistake...

DC: Trying out new moves is a good thing. It might not make the easiest game for black regardless of his strength, but on the other hand most opponents aren't used to deal with these moves either. It remains to be seen how much black got out of this in the end.

This stone creates a lot of influence for black in the centre; it will become easier for black to attack white groups and to rescue his own groups when he already has something in the middle.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[gd]LB[fc:A][fd:B]C[This stone is very unusual...

I think A or B would be better....

What do you think?

DC: This extension is not safe for White (it's easy to break through it). It doesn't strengthen D16 very well and it doesn't really help the corner either. This extension is best avoided as a response to C14. Both 'A' and 'B' are good locally. Globally, 'A' is safer, which doesn't let Black utilize his centre influence. Black wants to create as many weak group for White as possible.]
;B[ci];W[pq];B[qo];W[qk]CR[qd]LB[oc:2][od:1][qm:A]C[I played this stone here (instead of A)  because of
R16 because. My experience shows that on komoku (In this case R16) is followed up by 1 or 2....

Am I right or is A better?

DC: It is true that black wants to play 1 or 2 very soon and follow up with R10 (which R9 blocks), however both options must be considered also locally, and also wih K10 in mind. K10 automatically makes it hard for White in any fight. R9 is less aggressive than R7, and doesn't let the pincering stone come under attack (not good with K10), so in this case it looks good. A peaceful option for White is O4 - it avoids creating any weak White groups. Still I'd say that R9 is good.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[fq]C[DC: This is an overplay on Black's part. Because White is so low in the bottom right (O3), there is not much potential in this area, and it is not as valuable as other moves on the board (such as P17, R11). Additionally, the position in the right side is not one that allows Tenuki.

White H3 now is a move in the least interesting part of the board, and helps Black accomplish his goal of flattening White at the bottom.

A good reply instead would be: 1. C6, which secures the D4 stone, prepares for a further extension to C9 (which would also pose some threat to C11 group). 2. O4, which punishes Black for playing Tenuki on the right. O4 is, in fact, a big difference, since it does all of the following:
* Puts R5 in a risky position that will force Black to deal with it.
* While Black is doing the above, White will manage to secure R9 stone.
* P3 group will not be in any trouble, and instead of lying low on the 3rd line it will rise up to the 4th.
* And finally, it will also threaten F3 (because without White O4 Black can play there himself which makes life easier on F3).
It can also cause Black to double-pincer D4, but that won't have to be problematic, since White will have more influence in the bottom (and can threat F3 in order to live).]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[lq]C[DC: Black can cut. (See variations) Instead K3 will be better, but the position is still White's disadvantage. Reading is essential.]

(;B[jp];W[jq];B[io];W[iq]C[I think a very good result for w here.

DC: This is not so; while White got a fair amount of territory and his groups at the bottom are alive, this is 3rd line territory so it's not so big, while Black managed to lower White at the bottom - this works well with K10.]
;B[cn];W[dn]LB[eo:A]TR[ho][io][hp]C[I think A would be a bad move for white in this Situation because of the three marked stones.]
;B[cq];W[co];B[dq]
(;W[cm]LB[jc:B][od:A]SQ[dn][co][dp]C[Well, I think this stone was really tiny...

I played this stone because I feared that
b could increase his terretory very easily
by pressuring the the three marked stones..

Anyway, I think (after all) A or B are much
bigger and really more neccessary here.

Am I right?

DC: It is true that A is big. B is not as big because approaching a 3-4 is always a big move since it prevents an enclosure (Shimari), while B still leaves the White formation weak and doesn't enclose so much.

I know White doesn't want to have to play C7 at this point of the game; but if he doesn't Black will play there (see variation) on last move).]
;B[ic];W[lc]C[DC: This will be difficult with G16 instead of F16. Instead White can choose to Kosumi-Tsuke at C15 (Black replies with D14) and then enclose the corner in some way (like F17, but because of G16 it will be ineffective). There are also other options for pincers (higher and closer ones).]
;B[hd];W[gc]C[DC: Instead at G15 should be considered as well. Even though Black will be happy to play G17 himself, this move attemps to protect a corner that can be very easily invaded, and White G15 will make good influence as well as putting some pressure on C14 (which as you'll see later will become useful when Black invades). Overall I can't say clearly which move is better, but both should be considered.]
;B[nd];W[le];B[ge];W[fe];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc]C[DC: This move is not so good. White chooses to retain very few points instead of showing some resistance. Blocking at B15 instead is a much better attitude - Black will have to live in the corner and try to help his C14 group at the same time. White will get to go out into the centre and attack C14 as well as H16. That is White's best way to try and turn the game over.]
;B[bc]C[This is completely horrible for white....

What could white doing better (since move nr. 30)???];W[he]
;B[ie];W[hf]C[DC: White must capture the Black stone! Even right now it isn't captured, and this cut can completely shut G17 in the top side. This capture, even if (when) Black forces White to fill it up, will give White a strong shape without cuts that will be easy to extend from.]
;B[jf];W[lg];B[qg];W[of];B[pe];W[nb]C[too small...];B[gf];W[ff]
;B[gg];W[fg]TR[he][hf]C[I sacrificed the two stones in order to prevent
that b could increase his terretory on the left side....];B[pl]
;W[qi];B[pb];W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[rq]
(;W[qr]C[DC: At this point White is at a disadvantage. In times like this he must be pushing for advantage. Instead of replying so easily, White needs to at least consider playing a threat before. B S3 is not a very serious threat at this moment (in the late endgame it is) so White can play R8, R7 or S7 instead. The Black group is not very strong so this is a threatening move. If Black defends, White can defend at R2, and the position will be much better than in the game - so it is a clean gain. (compare variation)

White can also choose to ignore R3 completely, since there may be more urgent things, P3 is already alive for sure.]
;B[ql]C[DC: (in comparison to move 64 of the variation) Black got to play here which is good for Black and bad for White.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[qh];B[gh];W[bk];B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[mq];B[no]
;W[nr]C[Again very horrible for white.....

What can w do better??

DC: This is not a good way to connect both groups. Giving Black a ponnuki shape is too good for him. Instead of O4, simply play O2 which instead will give Black a weak shape.]
;B[pp];W[kp]C[DC: This move may be better placed at L5 or M5. Still there are more urgent things on the board. Before playing a local move like this check that all your groups are strong, and that there isn't any weak Black group.]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[rk];W[rj];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ll]LB[lj:C][kn:A]
[ln:B]C[I played this stone in order to reduce blacks
terretory, but I'm not sure if this stone can be
alive (altough there is A, B and C for white).

What do you think?

DC: White is in a large disadvantage, and since the middlegame is nearly over, this move must be attempted, and it has actual chances of survival. White can't really depend on 'C' because of the following variation. Even without 'C', the 'A'-'B' area is not stable, so even if Black blocks there, White may be able to force some moves and either connect to L4 anyway or manage to run to the left.]

(;B[lo];W[lj];B[ki]C[DC: Black is forcing White to connect where he can cut - not good.]

;W[cb];B[bb];W[hc];B[id];W[ib]C[DC: In the endgame, first look for the sente moves and the big moves. This move is not very profitable since this area can't really become Black territory because of M17.]

;B[ek];W[fk];B[gj];W[el];B[dk];W[dl];B[ai];W[ak]C[DC: This move is not big, nor threatening. White has D19 and N10 which are bigger, and F1 is sente and bigger.]

C[I think the yose was 'okay' (but nothing more).

The development on the bottom was okay,
but on the upper left and it was really poor....

Maybe w could also do something better on the
bottom left side.

It's always interesting to compare the opening (and the intention of both players) with the final result. ;-).

Very thanks for commeting this game.

DC: I put the main comments in the first move. Indeed, by comparing the opening and the end you can see that without C7 White would have been in trouble, since it's the centre of the whole territory.]
