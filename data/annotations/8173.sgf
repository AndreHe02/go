C[Lupus [2d\]: hi
ptitlou [2d\]: hi have a good game
ptitlou for reviewer : I choose this game because it drove me into a situation i find both very hard to avoid and very hard to cope with, which is black doing a very big and closed black framework. I don't get at which point I am letting the moyo getting too closed.

[kb\]: Hi - looked like an interesting game.  I will do my best]
;B[pd];W[dc]C[Lupus [2d\]: you too];B[pp];W[dq];B[de];W[cg]
;B[be]C[[kb\]: This move is not good.  It aims to split the White stones, but the bottom White stone has help in the lower left corner.  This move is better if D3 was Black.]
;W[fd]C[[kb\]: Correct.];B[ef]
(;W[eg]C[[kb\]: This move is not good either - it forces the Black group into the White group on the top.  White should just extend to D11 or C10.]
;B[fg];W[eh];B[ge]C[[kb\]: This move helps White.];W[gd];B[fh]
;W[dj]C[ptitlou for reviewer : Is this the correct point in this shape ?

[kb\]: Looks OK.];B[do]C[[kb\]: This feels like an overplay.  Black should extend to H15.]
(;W[co]C[[kb\]: This stone should definitely be a one-space low pincer.  This move hurts your group on the left side.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[he];W[ic]TR[he]C[[kb\]: Should have exchanged this before D5.]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[kd]
(;W[fi]C[[kb\]: Locally, you should just make a base.  However I still would play M17.]
;B[gi];W[fj]
(;B[gj]C[[kb\]: Big but not sente, so should play around G6.]
(;W[em]C[[kb\]: Just cut, unless you are sure you can get enough out of the attack.  Anything else probably leaves too much aji.]
;B[en];W[dm];B[eq]C[[kb\]: Interesting];W[dn];B[dr];W[eo];B[cq]
;W[dp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr]
(;W[bp]C[[kb\]: Very slow, and the wrong direction.  You already have a lot of points on the left side.  Either leave this or play on the outside to force Black to take B3.]
;B[fp];W[kc]C[ptitlou for reviewer : I was pretty happy with the result on the bottom left in sente. Was it good ?

[kb\]: It is OK.  Getting F3 in sente is much better than B4.]
;B[lc]C[[kb\]: Overplay.  See variation]
(;W[qf]C[[kb\]: Too early, see variation];B[id]C[[kb\]: Good move]
(;W[of]C[ptitlou for reviewer : I thought with thi tobi to have a very good point to erase black overall influence, but it happened that it was not enough. Is this where I missed an opportunity ?

[kb\]: This move is slow.  Extending here is probably enough.]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[gb];B[kb];W[ja];B[pj]TR[of][qf]C[[kb\]: Now these stones are under attack.  It is more important to make a base first]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[nq]C[ptitlou for reviewer : a few move before I was happy with the result, and at this point I feel late...

[kb\]: Yes, Q10 is in an excellent spot.]
(;W[rp]C[ptitlou for reviewer : Is this the correct move on the board ? THis is really a point in most of my games where I don't know to deal with the overall balance...

[kb\]: The balance of the game shifted when you let Black get F4, M17 and Q10, all of which were the key points in the game.  You didn't get any big points.

Locally, the correct move is R4.  Globally-];B[qp];W[ro];B[rq]

;W[oc];B[od];W[qb];B[nc];W[qd];B[gn]C[[kb\]: It's huge...]
(;W[gk]C[[kb\]: Small.  Now the game is high stakes - you need to throw a stone in the center and watch it live or die.]
;B[hk];W[hl];B[gl];W[fk];B[hm]C[ptitlou for reviewer : and here I start to do rubbish because I feel I am very late... Don't know what to do, is it too late anyway ?

[kb\]: Too late - resign.

Final comment.  Biggest thing this game is that you let the game get away from you because you missed the big points after the beginning.]
