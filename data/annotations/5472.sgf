C[Hi Backpacker,

This was a strange game in which a large fight you won but should have lost decided the game.

I'm not sure how much I can help in my review, but I will do my best.]

White's choice of D12 feels too small.  White is left floating and without an obvious approach on C16.]

I would have played R14, when white pulls back to L17 black can play the shimari and white feels a little cramped.]

R18 is premature, I would answer at J17];B[rb];W[ra];B[rc]C[--
Too small, remember white S17 is gote];W[ec]C[my answer to this is confusing. He has a weak group on the left.  I want to settle the upper left corner.  His one stone is weak but light.  My M17 will become garbage if I don;t be careful.

I would attach]

;W[ie];B[ed]C[good force??
--
no need, you have E15 to preven that eye if necessary.  But it doesn't hurt much]
;W[fd];B[jd];W[kf]C[okay, so that group is almost connected with the upper right.  Did I do okaY/  I can still attack the left side.
--
This is fine]
(;B[ci]C[--
I don't like this move, those two stones do not have two eyes on the left anyway so there is no point gouging out their eyespace.]
;W[ch];B[di];W[eh];B[fg];W[ei];B[bi];W[gi];B[hg]C[Can't let this last group connect.  Then he would have no weak stones.]
;W[je];B[kd];W[mb];B[lb];W[ih]C[knights more on running.  looks weak.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[ah];W[cg]C[bad more, right?
--
yes];B[cf];W[jp]C[--
K4 is the classic 'big before urgent'.  You need to get quite a lot of compensation from this attack to punish K4.]

M4 small, I would prefer R10.];B[qn];W[qj];B[ql]C[--
I don't like this move.  If you had protected with R11 then you can jump to R3 or O3 next]
;W[oj];B[ol]C[I want to jump into 3-3 but I think I need to strengthen these stones first.
--
R8 says you want to save R6, which is tricky.  Why?  R3 now would sacrifice R6 which doesn't fit with R8.  Also, O7 makes more sense locally.

I don't see the plan behind these moves but I feel you are inviting risk for no real benefit.]
