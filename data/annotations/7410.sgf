AB[pd][dp][pp]C[HI fba75, 
I'm thirdeye (1k) on KGS  and I'll be reviewing your game. 
All of my comments are marked with **

------------------------------------------------------------
I played this game against a 6k on KGS.

I think I lose the game on :
- Stones 132 and 150  : tactical mistake about the white group at C13. I should have kill it ;
- Stone 158 : didnt protect my uper right corner when I had time ;
- Stone 164 : react badly to defend my uper right corner after White S15. I could have saved a part of the corner.

I used all my time (25 mn per player) but didnt took time to think at the right moments.

Thank you for reviewing my game...];W[pl];B[qj]C[R10 probably too low and too close : Q11 better ?

** I prefer R10, it puts a lot of pressure on the Q8 stone and makes it difficult to get a base]
