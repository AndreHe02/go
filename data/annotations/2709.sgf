C[Hi, thanks for the review. I should have lost this game, but ended up winning because of a silly mistake on his part. I thought I was very far in the lead about half way through, but I let him build up far too much territory on the bottom right. How should I have went about reducing it?


Both of us are 16k (KGS)

nodrog];B[pd]C[Hi nodrog,

Glad to review the game for you. We all are the learners of Go. Therefore, I hope that we can learn from each other. I'll try my best to help you. Undoubtedly, I do make mistakes. If there is any points that you feel that you disagree with me, please don't hesitate to voice out your view. Let's us discuss it together all over again. However, there are no such thing call you are wrong but i'm correct. There are always better alternatives other than what we have covered. The good points we make might sound awesome to someone else. 

In the world of Go, we always learn from each other mistakes as well as the mistakes we make during the game. Of course, just by doing these are not enough. We can learn lots more if we study and observe games played by other players. 

There is a proverb in Go, it goes like this,"Better to study a game rather than playing a hundred games of Go". This means that we learn much by study how people play, of course here means how professinonal players think. But study the game of high dan amateur Go player do help in improving one's skill. But the way they think always cannot be compared to how the pro thinks.

Btw, talking so much is useless. just to enlighten you on the way to learn Go. Maybe you would think, am i fit to say these to you?Maybe my skills are even worse than yours?But it's ok to me. I like to share what i learn and experience with other people, which i think, i would learn more by doing so :-) Have fun!

;W[md]LB[nc:a][nd:b]C[This move seemed pretty strange by him (would have expected something on the open side), so I decided to ignore it and play a shimari in top left. Is this ok?

Since your left side is condusive to tackle this white stone, you should push white towards your left. This can make the counter-attack easier. points a and b is considerable better than your next move.]

;W[jj]TR[fe][eg][gg][gd][hd]C[Although by playing here, it implies that white is leading and taking control of the middle, but this move seems too early for me. White should at least secure his unsettled group first. But, it does tells me that he is trying to make an early move to save his group. But from this game, i don't really knows whether he thinks this way.]

P14 would only open more spaces for white to cut off your connection with the right side.]

Nope, you have taken the corner and white stones. if u play at point 'a', you are granted the control of the control already. Look it carefully.]

nodrog [16k\]: invasion at bottom was just trying to make a ko threat, wasnt trying to waste time
Gaddy [16k\]: i made a bad mistake

Overall, this is a game of an average level. But you did quite well. Why i say so?because you know how to grasp the oportunity to attack back while the opponent makes mistakes. I always encourage people to study professional Go players games. It will help to improve your skills pretty much.

There is a Go proverb goes like this:
To study a game is better than playing a 100 games of Go.

Hope this helps you. Sorry for the delay of this review.
