;B[pl];W[qq]C[Again, this is themovecriticized by joseki books.  I'm getting a lot of practice at learning to'punish' it.

yes, this move is not good. :) but the advantage is not
deciding the game.];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[no];B[mp]LB[nq:A][kq:B]C[I used to think this was tooaggressive.  I studied some in detail, and feel I can now de
al effectively with the move I feared (a).

there is no much to fear about 'a', except there comes a stone
at 'b'...];W[mo];B[lp];W[pj]C[Thisseems the best plan for white.  I fear I've already become a bit over
confident, being in the line I like.

it's a bit an optimistic move, but his only choice];B[nl]C[good!];W[qf]
;B[qh]LB[lo:A]C[This is probably tooaggressive.

maybe you should play at 'a' first, since it is a good move for
him too, then you can add a stone to your centre group.
actually the move you played also looks reasonable];W[ph]
(;B[pi]LB[qi:A]C[Would 'a' be better?

i think so, since he settles his group too easily.];W[qi];B[oi];W[rh];B
[qj];W[ri];B[oh];W[pg];B[qk]C[but your position is not bad: you have got a very strong group now!]
;W[qc]LB[nc:A][lo:B]C[This is why that  pincer was likely too aggressive.

locally i think this move is too slow. maybe double pincer is better
the point is his group got so strong compared to your corner that
he should try to attack it (and close it in). globally i would
play at 'b' now];B[pc]LB[kn:A]C[here maybe you could play 'a', anyway what continuation would
he have after a tenuki of you? the stone is light yet! :)];W[qd];B[mc]C
[Nervous about the 2stones, and probably a bit timid.   Any further, and I felt white could really abuse these stones.

yep, if it were only one stone you would be less concerned :)the move you played is honte now i think, but did you really want
this group ?];W[og];B[on]C[i use to omit peeps like this. can't prove it is wrong, but
some peeps turn out to be eyes later... :)];W[oo]
(;B[lo]C[i think B is better];W[om];B[pm];W[pn]
(;B[nn]C[bad move, you help him to escape];W[mn];B[nm];W[ln];B[fc]C[I feel now that I should have continued the attack against the lower
right group. I didn't think I had effective moves, so I switched, but now I
wonder if I had more advantage to be gained.

hm i think your move is ok. i don't see a good continuation either
for attacking the group];W[hd]C[Not expected. Was the approach wrong?

looks strange, usually white has a stone on this side, when he
plays this move, but now it will look a bit lonely];B[fe];W[df]
(;B[cg]MA[fc][fe]LB[cf:A]C[Unusual move I thought.  I felt it helped the left group, and might make the corner group nervous. It could have been too dangerous for my marked group.

it's not necessary to defend the left group now, besides the move
played is not good shape, he will block anyway at 'a', see var B];W[dg]
C[:)];B[ch];W[fg]LB[gf:A]C[i expected 'a' now, but it is overplay :)];B
[gf];W[if]LB[kc:A]C[too hectic, i think he must defend at 'a' first]

(;B[iq]LB[bd:A]C[Atthis point,I felt I was somewhat stable everywhere (though the 2 upper groups are
borderline).   i feel 'a' is the biggest now, it looks almost like sente too]

(;W[gd];B[fd];W[hf];B[gc];W[jb];B[ib]LB[gg:A]C[I think white could really roast this group as per variation.

it is strange to leave a point open like 'a'. when he finishes  closing you in one day, you can still make life.]

marked stone.  Maybe I was right to walk away from this group when I did.
(found a better variation later, replacing marked move)];B[qb]LB[bd:A]C
[Trying toensure life for this group.

'a' is so big!];W[rb];B[pb];W[cf]C[A very huge point. I got verynervous after this.]

(;B[ea]C[yes, still black is ahead];W[da];B[fa];W[cb]LB[gr:A]C[Now, endgame from here itseems. Where is the biggest point?  I felt I had to prevent white from getting too much in center.  'a' was a move I was dying to make, but white gets it first, so I feel I error in endgame through here.]

(;B[ej]C[I felt this would increase my left group and interfere with white.  Seems errant.]
;W[ik]C[And he begins to build that center.];B[gg]MA[ej]C[kind of double, reducing his centre]
;W[hh];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[mj];B[gj]LB[fl:A][fm:B][fn:C][gn:D]C[Thisreally seems to serve no purpose.  Maybe it restricts white some, but I felt
later that playing one of the lettered moves might make real territory for myself.]
;W[gm]LB[ra:A][gr:B][li:C]C[This seems a very effective move, that I don't handle very well. Any suggestions?

maybe tenuki? there are big moves, 'a' and 'b' and 'c'];B[fl]C[seems ok to me]
;W[fk];B[ek]LB[el:A]C[Playing a bit timid, thinking too much of trying to preserve the small lead.

maybe 'a' is better];W[em]C[I was so impressed with this sequence for white. Where did I go wrong? Was there a
way to deal with this move better?   i think this is overplay]
(;B[el];W[fm];B[dm]LB[hl:A][fo:B]C[I thought about the cutting threats of 'a' or 'b' first, but simply securing the area
appealed to me since I would have to eventually anyway.  Seems timid?

no it's ok :) you really need to defend];W[gk]C[little bit strange...]
(;B[hl]C[Trying to make it work anyway, though white's last move seems to work well.]

these stones are not so important]
(;B[ho]LB[in:A]C[I wonder if 'a' is better?

pity... i don't think it was necessary to defend here now];W[bn]C[Another huge point I wanted to get to first. I am not feeling good about this
endgame.];B[bm];W[bo];B[fo]LB[gr:A][bf:B]MA[fj][fk][gk][gl][gm][fm][em]
C[Stupid. This may be the game loser. I feel 'a' then 'b' are better moves.   I was still eyeing the marked chain of stones.  I look at possible counts in the variation.

after the endgame he played, the peep doesn't work anymore,
but the move you played is sente anyway!
so for that it is a little bit ajikeshi. i agree 'a' and 'b' are bigger]

(;B[gr];W[gq];B[fr];W[er];B[hq];W[fs];B[hs];W[bf];B[bg]C[So, it seems if I get to one of the real endgame points earlier, I might creep up a little
bit.])
