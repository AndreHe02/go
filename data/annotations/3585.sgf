C[Dakre: Hello,
this game was fun, because it became very close in the end and probably made my opponent and myself think hard... i think i already spotted some of my mistakes here and there, but if you find some other, please point them out...
i am most interested whether my perception of things is right or totally mistaken, which belongs to the evaluation of positions in the opening for example...
and of course all other things you notice ;)
thanks in advance...];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[cn]
;W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[cj];W[iq]C[DRS: This isn't so good.  It's bigger to play a kakari on Q3.]
;B[fc]C[Dakre: I chose this one, because i want to use my solid base in the bottom to build a framework on the top

DRS: I'm pretty sure my teacher would say to play a shimari with Q3 first.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[cf];B[jc]C[Dakre: that's why i was quite happy with this, but should i be? ;)

DRS: I think W's choice was poor here.];W[qo];B[pl]C[Dakre: Princer here to match with the upper side... but probably a lower one on the third line?

DRS: High pincer is better for building a moyo - which you might get in this game.]
;W[oo];B[np]C[DRS: N3 is probably better here, because of J3.]
;W[no];B[mp];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[pp];W[po];B[qe]C[DRS: This is a little slow.  You're probably better off with Q14 locally, but Q8 needs help, so it's perhaps best to play R11 or so.]
;W[qj]C[Dakre: A point where i didn't know how to answer at all... not to say that some of my answers i "knew" where errors ;)

DRS: You could P9 - this separates white's groups.  Or you could R12, which may force W to capture your single stone, but not on a particularly large scale.]
;B[oj]C[Dakre: more thickness ;)

DRS: If you want a moyo, this is good.  But White has it kind of easy by playing at R13 now.]
;W[rl];B[ph];W[md];B[kf];W[mf];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[ng]
C[Dakre: I guess this was a bad idea and i should have used the influence after chasing white a bit longer with something like e13 or so... what do you think?

DRS: If you want to contain W, I like O11 better.];W[ke];B[jf]
;W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[lh];W[id];B[he];W[ic];B[mc]C[Dakre: are there some better ways to achieve sth here?]
;W[lc];B[nd]C[DRS: You could O17 instead, making your corner solid, and W lives small.]
;W[mb];B[nc];W[me];B[hg]C[DRS: Good.];W[in]C[Dakre: I guess, white is somewhat ahead here?

cgoban2 thinks B is ahead by 6.5 here.];B[cc];W[cd];B[eb];W[db]
;B[dc];W[ed]C[Dakre: shouldn't white take the corneri nstead of cutting me were i don't have any territory and giving me a weak target to attack?]

C[Dakre: i guess there was no way to kill white here, right? ;)]
;B[gn]TR[fc][fd][gd]C[Dakre: my three stones where in danger here, but i thought that this one is more important]

LB[il:A]TR[nh][oh]C[Dakre: I thought of playing A to and didn't know, which is bigger... probably A, but i wanted to remove some aji of the two marked stones which managed to escape anyway ;)]

;W[kj];B[jj]LB[lk:A]C[Dakre: probably too late to catch those stones because of the weakness at A?]
