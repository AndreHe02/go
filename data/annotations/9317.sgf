C[rev: Hi, i'll review your game and focus on black side.
I'll try to answer your questions and comment the general play.
Have fun!

... sorry for my bad english :).

C[rev: (A) would have been better. Your move aims at the corner, but white can seal you in (also A) getting a thick wall playing well with (B).

At this stage of the game it's better to have allways access to the center.]
;W[qc];B[jc]LB[kc:B][lc:C][ld:A]C[rev: right idea but not perfect.
now you have access to the center again. But white could play at C giving you some headache.
B would have been better, I would prefer A or playing elsewhere]
;W[gc];B[dj];W[lc]C[rev: now you have the headache ;) ...]
(;B[mc]LB[lc:B][md:A]C[rev: this belongs to A! 
- either B gets captured, or black gets out of the corner, both is ok for black (see variation)]
;W[ld]LB[lb:B][ne:A]C[rev: white has good connection to A, Black is sealed in (B does not work for connection.]
;B[qb]C[rev: good];W[rb];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[kc]C[rev: even if black survives it's very bad for black as white has really strong influence at top and right side while black has only the bottom with many open points white can invade.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[na];W[la];B[cf]LB[ob:A]C[rev: the group still needs one move to get live. A is the most obvious making instantly 2 eyes.]
;W[ob]C[rev: now the group is dead.];B[oa]LB[pa:A][qa:B]C[rev: I don't like this kind of moves and they never ever work. You aim to make a 2nd eye at A, but it's obvious that B simply has to play at B. 

You opponend is as smart as you are. So why should he miss the obvious answer?

additional reasons why you should not play here
- you are wasting ko threads 
- there might be some chance that you can use this group later when the surrounding situation change.

so: if a group is dead: leave it alone! 


... personally i had a couple of games where a dead group helped me to win the game later :)]
;W[qa];B[ra]C[rev: ... keep cool ... (same as move 33)];W[sa]
;B[od];W[oe];B[pe];W[qe]C[rev: mistake by white; black can be easily cought in a ladder]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[qf]LB[pf:A][qf:B][og:D][pg:C]C[rev: not wise, before this move, the group had 3 liberties; after this move, the group still has 3 liberties, BUT white has the next move.

C is better, only threatening to play at B 
or D (just get to the center)];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[of];W[qh]
;B[me]LB[of:A][ng:B][oh:C]C[rev: good move, but too early. Your group at A is in danger. B or C first, than A]
;W[nd];B[md];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[lf];W[oc];B[pa]LB[kc:D][od:B]
[le:C][mg:A]C[rev: i would have played that move at A, forcing B giving you sente (e.g. C) and seal white in. Yes you lose 6 points, but you also weakening the group at D and have good access to the center]
;W[od]LB[le:B][mg:A]C[rev: mistake by white. I would have played at B or A]
;B[le];W[jd];B[lg];W[og];B[fq];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[cl]LB[dj:B]
[co:A]C[rev: A was ok. here, as you had the stone at B.];W[fn]
;B[mg];W[cq]LB[bo:A]C[rev: aims to connect at A.];B[cp]LB[cl:B]
[bn:D][bo:A][cq:C]C[rev: if you play at A here, you can easy connect to B, OR kill C more easily if white blocks at D.]
;W[bq];B[bp]LB[dr:A]C[rev: bad shape and white still cannot connect here. It would be more efficient to reduce the eye space (e.g. A)]
;W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[ep];W[dq];B[cs];W[cr];B[es];W[bs];B[ds]
;W[ar];B[fo]C[rev: well played! I found no obvious way how to kill this group (from move 74 on).]
;W[en];B[go]LB[fl:B][gl:C][en:A]C[rev: there is no danger to your group or that white can invade here.
You should try to capture the group at A (white has no eyes!) Even if you do not manage capturing, you will gain great influence. 
How about B or C?];W[fk];B[dh]LB[fi:D][cj:A][fm:B][hm:C]C[rev: wrong spirit ... your group at A has access to the border (much eyespace, nothing to worry about. The white group at B still has nothing. 

Still threatening to capture will give white no opportunity to play elsewhere giving you more and more influence.

either from the top (D) or from the bottom (C)];W[fi]C[rev: chance is wasted ... the white group is looking good now]
;B[bd]LB[kc:C][hd:D][fe:E][hm:B][nn:A]C[rev: too small,

how about A or B?

you could use C and play at D (threatening capturing C) and connecting with E later]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[lp]LB[fe:E][nj:F][hm:D][nn:C][hq:B][qq:A]
C[rev: never play near your own strong groups.

there is nothing white can do about your group at A or group at B, both are like a fortress. you don't have to connect them.

Still C or D or E or F];W[ef];B[jb];W[ic];B[je];W[ie];B[ke]
;W[kd];B[jg]LB[ih:B][nj:A]C[rev: you seem afraid that white could capture, but there is much room to the center.
A or B gains some influence];W[if];B[jf]LB[nj:A]C[rev: worth 1 point, A: worth ~20 points]
;W[no];B[np]C[rev: I don't understand that move];W[oo];B[oh]
;W[pg];B[ni]LB[nk:A]C[rev: too small! -> A!];W[nk];B[mj]C[rev: too slow!

i'll stop my review here.

In general it seems to me that you are often afraid that your groups might get killed. Most of the time it's more efficient to run to the center (while threatening something bad if you can) than to get your 2 eyes fast. If your group has influence you don't have to worry about eyes.

"not getting killed" is not enought to win ... :)];W[hm];B[in]

[pd:C][ne:A][oe:B]C[rev: one continuation; it's better for black than it looks:
- black can attack A playing at B (ladder works for black here) while slipping out of the corner also attacking both stones at C at the same time
OR
capture the group at D fast ( there is no room for white to make life.)

White cannot defend both at the same time]))
