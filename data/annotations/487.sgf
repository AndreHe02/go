C[MM: Go Teaching Ladder review of yoonys-eb 1997-11-01 by Mike Malveaux <mm@foxinternet.net>, "malveaux" on IGS, November 9, 1997]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[qp];W[dc];B[eq]C[MM: This kakari is a good option. Also consider making a shimari at P4 or O3, then extending to R10 or Q10.]
;W[gq]C[MM: White plays a pincer in response to the Black kakari.]

(;B[cq]N[actual game];W[cj];B[pj]C[MM: This starts a possible large right-side moyo for Black; White has a similar skeletal framework in place on the left.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[MM: Good standard response to the White kakari. In this case, with the Q16 stone on the 4th line, I might prefer to play Q17.]
;W[pc]C[MM: White wants the corner. See variation for another common sequence, White N15 to develop a line to  the center.]

(;B[qd]N[actual game]C[MM: A good play. I tried this at O16, but the result seems better for White.]
;W[lq]LB[dp:a][bp:b][nd:c][ic:d][nq:e]C[MM: Now where should Black play?
Develop the lower left corner with D4 or B4? Seal in the upper right corner with O16? Extend along the top side with H17? Make a loose shimari with O3, threatening K3?]
;B[nq]C[MM: Good choice];W[hc];B[cn];W[bn];B[co]C[MM: I think this Black stone might be better at B5.]

(;W[dp]C[MM: I think B5 works better for White.]N[actual game- W D4]

(;B[bq]N[actual game- B B3];W[dq];B[dr];W[ep];B[fq];W[fp];B[gr]
;W[hq]C[MM: White has a more aggressive response at F2.]
(;B[nd]N[actual game]C[MM: This is a good idea, but I think it is probably better to play B5 or B4 before switching to this part of the board.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[kb]C[MM: This feels dangerous for White. Black can now probably kill the White corner. I would prefer to play White N17 and sacrifice the White stone at M18.]

(;B[mc]N[actual game];W[nb];B[oc]C[MM: Sacrificing a stone at O19 instead gives Black the leverage to take the corner.]
;W[ob];B[ma];W[qb]C[MM: After Black at N19, White's corner is is serious danger. R18 doesn't save it; Black can kill the corner with S18 or S17.]

(;B[qc]N[actual game];W[od];B[oe];W[rc];B[rd];W[sb];B[ra]LB[ce:a]
[bo:b][qm:c][ph:d][ne:e][oc:f]C[MM: There is little point in Black attacking the corner now, because after T18 it is easy for White to make two eyes. Black should use this sente to attack around C15 or B5, or to make the Black territory stronger with a stone near R7 or Q12, or to seal the corner with O15 or P17 then P16.]
;W[qa];B[pa];W[pb];B[na];W[oa];B[me]C[MM: This is a good move, sealing White into the corner and giving Black a strong center-facing wall.]
;W[nr]LB[bo:a][kd:b][de:c][pq:d][op:e]C[MM: This may be a wrong way for White to approach the corner. In defending against White at O2, Black will become strong in the corner. Also, attacking along the second line at this stage of the game makes only a small difference in the final score. B5, L16, and D15 seem more important to me; Q3 or P4 seem like more promising attacks on the corner.]
;B[or];W[mr];B[op]C[MM: Good, Black should not let White attack at P3.]
;W[hr];B[gs];W[bp]C[MM: B5 is better for cutting off the two Black stones. Also, H1 is sente for White because it threatens a double atari at F2.]

(;B[bo]N[actual game];W[bm];B[ap]C[MM: Good connection for Black]
;W[hs]C[MM: Good move for White, keeping sente -- "initiative" -- and preventing a Black incursion at H1.]
;B[er];W[cf];B[og]LB[pl:a][cl:b][gp:c][kc:d][jd:e]C[MM: This seems like a weak play by Black. Black is already strong in the upper righ
t. A better play would be near Q8, strengthening an area where Black is weack -- or C8, attacking an area where White is weak; or cutting at G4 could work -- White cannot shicho because of the Black stone at Q10.  L17 or K16 are also important.]
;W[mo]LB[pm:a][qm:b]C[MM: Expanding into the center is the right idea; but Black will get strong along the right in response to this. Q7 or R7 seems better for White.]
;B[lj]LB[pm:a][dl:b]N[actual game]C[MM: Black's upper right is strong, but I am pretty sure that it is not strong enough for an extension that big. White can make things very complicated by cutting with something near O10 or M12. For now, Q7 or D8 are probably more important anyway.]
;W[hj]
(;B[ie]C[MM: This provokes a White response around G15. Playing K17 first is a more severe attack on the upper side.]
;W[ge]N[actual game];B[jc];W[jb];B[ic];W[ib];B[hd]C[MM: White is strong enough for the double hane (two diagonal plays) at G16.]

(;W[gc]N[actual game];B[gd];W[fd];B[fc];W[fb]TR[ib][jb][kb]
[lb]LB[ed:a][fe:b]C[MM: White F18 is too conservative. The stones along J18-M18 have enough liberties for White to play at E16 or F15 instead. Black's attack should not work.]
;B[fe];W[ed];B[gf];W[ef];B[ff];W[kc];B[kd];W[eg]
(;B[he]LB[ql:a][pm:b][fi:c][dl:d]C[MM: Unnecessary. A wasted move by Black. This would be better around R8, Q7, F11, or D8. Also, Black can probably use the hole at E15 and the threat of the stone at F17 to take the upper left corner.]
;W[gh]N[actual game];B[ih];W[hg];B[ig];W[jj]
(;B[ki]C[MM: I think that L8 gives Black a better grip on the center.]
;W[kl]N[actual game];B[ll];W[lm];B[km];W[jm]
(;B[ln]C[MM: At the end of the game, Black seems to regret taking the M6 point.]
;W[mm]N[actual game]
(;B[mn]N[B N6- actual game];W[kn]C[MM: This defends
 well against Black's attack.]
(;B[nn]C[MM: It seems better to push first at M5.];W[nm]LB[lo:a]
C[MM: Connecting at M5 is important for White. There is opportunity to push at N8 or O7 later.]
N[actual game];B[on];W[pl];B[ol];W[om]C[MM: After Black P8, Black must follow through and cut at Q7.

At the end of the game, Black comments regretfully about M6, but this seems to me to be the turning point of the game.]

(;B[ok]N[actual game];W[pn];B[po]LB[ql:a][dl:b][cm:c]C[MM: This move does not seem to help Black very much. The lower right corner is already separated from the middle right side, and the four stones along M6-P6 are not in danger of being cut off -- if White P5, it is not atari because of the liberty at M5, and Black O5 connects the group. R8 does more to limit the damage of the White right side invasion. Also, Black can put pressure on White around D8 or C7.]
;W[qn]C[MM: Again, it is more important for White to connect at M6. R6 does not threaten the Black corner or right side, and the job of separating the two groups is already done.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[lp];W[kp];B[en];W[fn]
(;B[el]C[MM: Black seems better at C7.];W[dm]N[actual game]
C[MM: White seems better at E8.]
(;B[cm]N[actual game]C[MM: Good. Black should push through like this.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[fm]C[MM: The stone at E6 has already captured the White D7 stone; Black can play F7 later if White tries to escape at E7. Instead, this can probably be at G8 or F10. Also, this is a good time to surprise White with an invasion at D15.]
;W[gn];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi];B[gm];W[hm];B[fo];W[go]C[MM: Black has done a good job of reducing the usefulness of White's wall along B4-F4.]
;B[eo];W[gl];B[fl];W[gk];B[gi];W[hi];B[hh]C[MM: R8 is still more important. Also, N3 is a good sente move for Black; it removes a White threat of saving the N5 stone while also forcing a White response near L2.

Assuming normal endgame play and no major mistakes, White seems to be ahead by 15 to 20 points. Black's best chance to win is probably the D15 invasion, but Black apparently did not see it.]
;W[gg];B[ij]C[MM: Black cannot really get away with this; White at J11 seems safe. R8 is more important anyway.]

;W[so];B[rr]C[MM: In this game it does not matter since there were no ko fights -- but for groups like Black's corner that already have good eye shape, the hanging connection at S2 unnecessarily gives White a ko threat. In general, when eyeshape has already been made, a solid connection at S3 is probably better because it leaves fewer ko threats.]

;W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[qr]C[MM: Again, a solid connection at Q2 would give White fewer ko threats, since the corner already has good shape for eyes.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[hf];B[nj]C[MM: After White H14, Black needs to play K15 or K16.]

(;B[nd]N[B O16 worse];W[oe];B[mc];W[nb];B[md];W[pc]C[MM: If Black plays like this, White can get the corner, and probably either the top side or the upper right, depending on what Black does next.]

C[MM: This is a typical sequence. Black can live in the corner, and probably on the top side with potential for expanding at F17. White can probably live on the top side after playing N2, but White may choose to use sente to put pressure on the two Black stones with L16 or L17, developing center-facing influence.]

(;B[fo]N[common- B at F5]C[MM: Often, Black tries to run into the center with a stone at or near F5.  Since the C4 stone can make life in the corner, White usually protects the G3 stone with an extension to K3.]
;W[jq];B[cq];W[dn]LB[oq:a][ce:b]C[MM: Once Black takes the corner, White usually extends to take claim space along the side.  Now a play near P3 or C15 is large for either side.]
