I know its not me who should review game, but probably with them you can imagine how much I understand at GO: I play it for one month. So... Thank you in advance!

********************REVIEWER*******************

Hello! =) I'm Hikaru79, and I'll be your reviewer this evening ;) I'm about 9k and you can contact me at adrianp@cogeco.ca or on my forum, www.thegoban.com , if you have any further questions about this game. Hopefully my review will be satisfactory ^ ^;

NOTE: I've prefixed my comments with [Hikaru79\] in order to distinguish between your questions and my answers.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[pm];B[og];W[of];B[qg];W[pg];B[ph];W[pf];B[rg]
;W[rf];B[nh];W[mg];B[nq];W[lp];B[no];W[ln];B[nm]TR[pm]C[[Hikaru79\]: Good =) Putting some pressure on the marked stone.]
;W[ok]
(;B[pk]LB[ol:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: This move does not cut. You want something like A. See variations.]
;W[ol];B[ql];W[qm];B[oj];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qo];W[ro];B[qr]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[nn];B[mo]C[[Hikaru79\]: OK, good :) Double-peep.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[ko];B[kp]C[[Hikaru79\]: A good exchange for black, at least in the last few moves. Although black has lost quite a bit more on the right side than he needed to, at least now his lower side is large.]
;W[jo]
(;B[lq]C[[Hikaru79\]: M4 is not a threat to you. Do not waste a move surrounding it, because by doing so, you are ignoring the pushing battle going on at K5. J4 would have been much better here. See variation.]
;W[ip]LB[kn:B][io:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: As it goes, J4 is a VERY good and severe move by white. You shouldn't have let it happen.

Black's only consolation is the cutting points left at A and B.]

(;B[mp]C[[Hikaru79\]: A completely wasted move. M4 was already toast -- you didn't need to kill it. 

See variations for cutting point alternatives.];W[cn]TR[ln]
[jo][ko][ip]C[Because of J4, now white can afford to push you from that side, into his strong marked group.]
;B[gp]LB[io:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: Not bad :) Threatening the A cut even more strongly now. You handled a bad situation well.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq]LB[io:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: See variation for what would have happened if you'd cut at A instead of defending the corner. This works too, though.]
;W[io]C[[Hikaru79\]: White defends the cut, unfortunatly.];B[iq]
;W[df]
(;B[cl]C[With this move I wanted to make stronger group and at the same time not to give up much territory. Now I think move to D7 or even D6 could be better.

[Hkaru79\]: Actually, C8 is perfect. The C6 group is now very weak and needs to run. D7 is also playable, and D6 is not as good; I've made some variations covering those moves.]
;W[ch]C[After this white`s move I was in shock and didnt know what to do...

[Hikaru79\]: No need to be shocked; pincers like this are something you will be encountering a lot in Go :) It may seem severe at first, but if you step back and look at it, white has two weak groups deep in black's circle of power. Now it's simply a matter of choice as to which side you'll emphasize. The move you made is perfectly valid, but you had a few other choices (marked A and B). See variations.]
;B[em];W[en]LB[fm:B][dn:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: Remember how I said "contact moves are the resource of the defender"? Well, white is using that resource  now. And it turned out well for him. You responded at "A", but see my variation for B.]

(;B[dn]C[[Hikaru79\]: Not ideal. See variation.];W[do];B[dm]
;W[eo]LB[gn:C][co:A][ep:B]C[[Hikaru79\]: Now, black cannot play "A." However, all is not lost; white does not have enough space for eyes, so if you can cage him in you still have a shot to go for the kill. You played at "B" but perhaps that is not the most urgent move. See my variation for "C."]

(;B[ep];W[cp];B[bq];W[go]
(;B[dr]C[[Hikaru79\]: The D3 cut is not really a threat. H3 however, is. Defending one of those weak points should have taken priority. See variation.]

(;W[fp];B[fq];W[fo];B[hp]C[[Hikaru79\]: Luckily for black, white took F4 instead of H3, allowing you to still patch up your weakpoint. You got lucky :)]
;W[ho];B[hr];W[fc]
(;B[fe]C[[Hikaru79\]: Good move! Does much to weaken two white groups simultaneously. There were a few other options, however. See variations.]
;W[hd];B[cc];W[lc];B[ld];W[md];B[mc];W[kd]
(;B[kc]C[[Hikaru79\]: Never let your opponent get a strong shape (like a ponnuki) near to your strong areas. See variations.]
;W[le]TR[lc][kd][md]SQ[kc][jd]C[[Hikaru79\]: The ponnuki, formed by the triangled stones, is a very strong shape, and pulls the Q14 stones almost completely out of danger. As well, the squared black stones aren't looking happy either.]
;B[lb];W[jc];B[kb];W[id];B[ld];W[ke];B[ne];W[nf];B[rd]C[Here I played  so cowardly, afraid to fight whites... Thats my thoughts and probably I should have even touch wites or play at other place.

[Hikaru79\]: Well, white has come out very victorious in this side. There's really no effective fight you can start. Defending the corner with S16 is OK, although perhaps anticipating white's next move and playing F13 would be better.]
;W[fg]CR[df][ch]C[[Hikaru79\]: With this move, F14, the marked stones grow significantly in stability (although they are still quite weak). Out of the two weak groups black had created in white's shape earlier, none of them remain. I blame L17.]
;B[gd]C[[Hikaru79\]: Bad. Your shape becomes too thin. As you can see, white does, after a few moves, play the weak point of your shape here .. E15.]
;W[gc]
(;B[he]C[J17 could be better? now I only gave territory to white.

[Hikaru79\]: J17 is very small. See variation.];W[ee]C[[Hikaru79\]: Knight's moves can be cut, remember that.]
;B[jb];W[je];B[ic];W[ce];B[ec];W[ed];B[eb];W[bc]
(;B[bb]C[[Hikaru79\]: A move on B16 is better, and perhaps would have made your group alive. See Variation.]
;W[bd]
(;B[cd]C[[Hikaru79\]: Tsk. "Empty Triangles" are not reccomended unless they're absolutely neccesary, which they're not here. D18 would have assured life. So would a monkey jump to H19.]
;W[db]
(;B[be]C[[Hikaru79\]: This does nothing at all. A monkey jump at H19 would still have saved you.]
;W[bf];B[jd]C[[Hikaru79\]: Might have worked, if F16 was occupied by black already. Perhaps you missed that extra liberty?]
;W[fd];B[hc];W[ge];B[gb];W[fb];B[ie];W[jc];B[ia];W[hb];B[jd]
;W[gd];B[ib]C[With G19 I could have get H18 and not give up G18

[Hikaru79\]: Yes. However, it's not that big a loss. About 4 points.]
;W[gl]C[[Hikaru79\]: It's now 123 moves into the game, and it's about time we counted the score. See the pass variation for a quick estimation.]

(;B[fl];W[gk];B[gj];W[fj];B[fk];W[fi];B[hj]LB[gm:A]TR[dj][fk]
[cl][fl][dm][em][dn]C[Completely wrong direction.

[Hikaru79\]: I don't see why. The marked stones are weak, yes, but now "A" is a big point.]
;W[bj]LB[gm:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: Black and White both missed A. Big mistake. Black should take A immediatly. See the lengthy variations.]

(;B[ci]LB[gm:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: All you're doing with this move is strengthening White's B10 stone. Even disregarding A, there are still better moves available. See variations.]

;B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[ki];B[lh];W[kh]
(;B[mj]LB[kj:A]TR[gj][hj][jj]C[[Hikaru79\]: Wrong side. You want to save the marked stones. N10 is only making them weaker. See variation for A.]
