C[after game comment (w): after having taken the corner i wanted to do something about blacks right side and i wanted to use r6 because b refused to play q6- so i played r8

------------

CC:  this is not really a good idea --
remember that black has the san san rei advantage on the right -- so you don't need to expect to get everything -- you should have been happy with the corner and moved elsewhere ... O17 or something]

;W[rm];B[rn];W[qf]C[after game comment (w): i know the situation around o8 is not solved yet. but i thought b doestnt have a simple way to capture it. i didnt want to miss the opportunity to do something about the right side so i played r14.

i do now see that. in this game was probably thinking more about disturbing my opponent instead of caring about my own territory and groups.

-----------------
again the most important thing here is to remember that your opponent is allowed to get some points... especially when he starts with a san-san-rei.... so now in an effort to keep him from getting anything, you have 2 very weak groups... which actually should be thought of as negative points...]

nice solid shimari -- the wall is far less powerful now that you have it --]

not bad position on the board here

this move is unnec.  should do something that gets you points]

CC:::
your stratagy was a risky... if you had an opponent who knew how to use the power (walls) you were giving him... it would have been a tough game -- but you did a good job of making your groups live... and you had the advantage after he gave you the bottom left corner -- you lost in the endgame ... missed some big moves there -- could have won by 5-10 easy...]
