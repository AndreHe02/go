C[cc: interesting game. you fell behind in the opening. you played strange moves but your opponent handled them well.]
;B[oe];W[dp];B[po];W[dd];B[jj]C[I'm experimenting with this type of opening. I've already played 8 games (2 are still going on) and all were lost, but I think that because of fighting or judgement mistakes. I did win once with a bot tho ;)]
;W[pc];B[qe];W[nd];B[ne];W[md];B[pi]C[cc: too close. you want to extend far and start a fight if he invades. this looks a bit overconcentrated]

[qq]C[cc: these exchanges were not good for you. white gets points on the bottom. you don't get much. the center is still open. white is leading now.]

(;B[df]LB[fc:B][fd:C][cf:A]C[Is this the correct direction of attack? or maybe play something else here?

cc: high is unusual. i would stick with low unless you have special strategy. i would have just split or low approached.]
;W[ch]C[cc: interesting.];B[fd];W[ee];B[dc];W[cc];B[cd]C[cc: this doesn't work out well for you in the game. its good to experiment with new things like this, but you have to be careful to read out some continuations - in this case white plays simply as in the game and gets a good result.]
;W[ec];B[db];W[cb];B[ed];W[de];B[eb];W[fe];B[fc];W[bd]C[cc: white should C15 instead. no aji]

(;B[hb]C[this was in the game, but isn't it better to play h15 instead? See variation

cc: yes h15 better];W[he]C[cc: this variation is too good for white - white gets a very strong wall black is reduced.]
;B[gc];W[pj];B[qi];W[oj];B[qj];W[pm];B[pn]C[cc: try not to touch weak stones. this helps white gets stronger]
;W[om];B[pq];W[km]C[cc: white settles down easily];B[mo]LB[jo:A]
C[This was too slow. Is something better than K5 now?

cc: K5 is a good point];W[ln];B[nq]LB[os:A]C[Black can play n3 for shape, but this helps in yose if White plays monkey jump p1]

C[this was too slow - can black play something better?
