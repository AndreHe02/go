GC[I know I (black) made an error at 160, should have connected at (13,9) the upper right wall to the lower group.
What could I've done prior to that, given that I have rather thick walls, to prevent white from obtaining two eye shape in the upper central region as it was after move 126?]


AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[uttoogami [21k\]: Hi



-- Hello, I'm Sven and about 7 kyu at DGS. I'll try to clear things a bit up for you.
All my comments are preceeded by "--" so you can spot them more easily.

-- In summary, Black and White's reading abilities for local fights were rather balanced. At some points in the game, Black could have taken some more importants spots, I have marked them in the commentaries.
Nevertheless, Black has made good use of his handicap stones, which - since on the 4-4-points - are useful for influence rather than for territory, and has built up a large central territory!
So the outcome of the game depended on the fate of White's invasion starting with move 127, as you already stated. Here White should not have been able to live, and I hope my comments will show you some hints how to prevent this.
In general - and this is also true for the earlier stages of the games -  you should keep a bit more distance from your oppenent's stone when you aim is to stake out spheres of influence or territory, at least as long as no local fighting is necessary. The reason ist that contact moves strenghten the opponent's stone and at the same time may weaken the attacking stone since they take away one liberty for each player, but your opponent is the one to move next. So there is an inherent danger that you opponent will atari or chase your attacking stone and can break through your intended wall or build eyes by capturing your stone (as he did in the game).]
