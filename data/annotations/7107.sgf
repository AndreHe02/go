C[Dear reviewer

Thanks for your time. This was a serious but friendly game that lasted more than 2 hours. I sent it for review because I wasn't happy with the opening for White but didn't really understand what caused me being behind. During the middle game I kept the feeling of running behind matters.

Please evaluate this feeling and do give comments where you think they are important.

Dieter

Hi Dieter,

My name is Jon, and I'll be providing the commentary for your review.  My comments are marked with "Jon:".]
;B[dp];W[qc];B[dd];W[oq];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn]
(;B[qn]C[Jon:  Pushing a second time before jumping ahead will allow white to build a stronger wall towards the bottom, so the extra few points of territory black gets is usually not worth it compared to white's extra strength.  Black is better off jumping ahead immediately.]
;W[pm];B[ql]
(;W[iq]LB[jq:A]C[Dieter:  Should I have extended at A instead?

Jon:  Yeah, I don't think white's wall is strong enough to make an extension this far.]

(;B[jp]C[Dieter:  I found this a very difficult answer to deal with.

Jon:  Understandably!  While it's painful for white, It's still very early in the game, so I feel reducing is too early at this time, there's still a lot of open areas to worry about.

Can you find a good alternative for black?];W[ip];B[jo]
(;W[fq]C[Dieter:  The extension is cramped.

Jon:  Yup, so I'd recommend going in the other direction.  What's the best way to do that?]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]
(;W[jm]C[Dieter:  I thought this was the logical place to make use of my fortified goup.

Jon:  Agreed, trying to remove black's room for establishing himself along the side won't be too effective here.]
;B[in];W[fn];B[im];W[jk];B[il];W[lk]LB[jl:A]TR[jm]C[Jon:  This strikes me as unnecessarily fancy.  A simple connection at A would keep white's stones strong in preparation for continuing the attack on black's escaping stones.  It also prevents the problem of black's push at A, making it hard to save the marked white stone (and prevent a possible eye).]
;B[dl]LB[fq:B][iq:A]TR[il][im][in][jo][jp]C[Dieter:  Black laughs in White's face. You could see this position as Black making territory on both sides, while cutting White in 2 weak groups. Where did I go so astray?

Jon:  Ouch, white is *mean*!  ^^  You're right though, as long as black doesn't get into trouble with the marked stones, the position is definitely favorable for him.  I believe the key error was in the overextension to A.  Black's reduction may have been a bit early, but it was still effective.  Making the cramped extension to B immediately also hurt a bit.]
;W[fc]LB[gl:A]TR[il][im][in][jo][jp]C[Dieter:  Frankly I did not know how to play.

Jon:  This is a good move.  I'd like to get the jump to A at some point, but it's hard to find a way to get an effective attack going on the marked black stones.]
;B[df];W[nd]LB[jc:A][qj:B]C[Jon:  An interesting idea!  This sets up both the extension at A and the attack and B, so I like it.]
;B[hc];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[bb];B[da];W[cb];B[ec];W[bf]
;B[cf];W[be];B[bg];W[fl]C[Jon:  This is timed well, as black would love to jump to this same point next, expanding his left side framework while helping his escaping stones.]
;B[jl];W[kl];B[km]LB[lk:A]TR[jm]C[Jon:  This is why I didn't like the original defense at A earlier, black was able to cut off the marked stone too easily.]
;W[lm];B[kn]C[Dieter:  Although Black is overconcentrated, he is now very strong

Jon:  That's true, though it was somewhat hard to attack him from the beginning, so I wouldn't be too worried.  At the moment, white must be more concerned about finding a new area to build territory and preventing black's left side from getting too big (in that order).]
;W[jc]LB[kc:C][lc:B][qj:A]C[Dieter:  I probably should have played A now

Jon:  This one's good too, but A's definitely bigger, so I'd prefer to get it first.  

Locally speaking, this extension might be a bit far due to black's strength to the left, you have to worry about an invasion to the right, (e.g. B), so I'd consider extending a little more slowly (to C instead).]
;B[qe]LB[qh:A][qi:B]C[Dieter:  And here A?

Jon:  Yeah, you don't want to miss the opportunity to attack.  I'm concerned about black moving this far up the side, I would've strongly preferred to extend more carefully to B to avoid any complications.]
;W[qd]C[Jon:  This misses an important opportunity.  By being allowed to extend back down the right side, black can build his territorial lead, so white must be more aggressive to prevent that.]
;B[qi];W[ch];B[cg];W[eh]C[Dieter:  The problem is I have no weak groups to attack and I feel behind on territory. SO I'm trying to make Black weak.

Jon:  You're definitely behind, so this is a reasonable plan.  The left side could become quite large if white didn't do something about it, so it's a good place to start.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[dj]LB[ci:A]C[Dieter:  Better at A

Jon:  Yup, it's more efficient.];W[dh];B[fj];W[hh];B[er]LB[pe:A]
C[Dieter:  Black regretted this territorial choice but I thought it was well timed because W is getting short on eyespace and the cut is  threatening.

Jon:  I don't think it's a bad chioce for those reasons, though I'd really like to get the push up to A first, which would strengthen the right side territory and slowly begin to neutralize white's potential in the center.]
;W[he]C[Dieter:  Played to further weaken Black while making shape for my group and building some framework.

Jon:  This is fine, that center framework is starting to show some potential for making some territory.]
;B[bi];W[qk]TR[pm][pn][po][oq]C[Dieter:  This looked better when played than when analyzed. See variation.

Jon:  I'm not so sure about it, white's marked stones will be damaged when black pushes up in response, so it's somewhat dangerous for white.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[rm];W[qj]
(;B[jq]TR[qe][qi]C[Jon:  Continuing the fight on the bottom is important, though white's center framework will be damaged if black can make the marked stones live.  I'd like to continue the fight on the right side first by way of the variation you provided.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[ml];W[ll];B[ol]TR[qe][qi]C[Jon:  This is more cautious than trying to save the marked black stones directly, but I'm concerned black will fall behind if he gives them up.  Even if he can attack the bottom right white stones, they have plenty of room to settle, so there won't be as much profit from this.]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[oj]C[Dieter:  I think the moyo is full of aji

Jon:  Quite true!  You most likely won't get a huge amount of territory, but you'll have to take what you can get.]
;B[mn];W[qr];B[mq];W[rq];B[md];W[nc]
(;B[nj]TR[qe][qi]C[Jon:  This was a somewhat dubious decision.  It's simple, but by giving up the marked stones, white will gain a significant amount of territory, putting black behind, and it could be hard to catch up.  I'd prefer to try and save the marked stones.]
;W[pi]C[Dieter:  I was happy to get this move.

Jon:  This was a key point in the game.  Gaining the right side will put white into the lead, so you don't have to rely on the center as much.]
;B[mj];W[og]LB[hj:A]TR[fj]C[Dieter:  But this may have been too territory oriented. Now I prefer A for thickness.

Jon:  It'll be a big mess if black tries to pull out that marked cutting stone, and considering white's gain in territory on the right side, I would expect black to.  I'd strongly prefer A instead.]
;B[gj]TR[fk][fl][fn][fp][ip][fq][iq]C[Dieter:  Black was feeling behind too though and thought this was rather desperate.

Jon:  Black's definitely behind now, so attacking the marked white stones is a reasonable decision.  The problem for white is the fact that these stones will be running right into your center potential!]
;W[hk];B[hj];W[ik];B[ii];W[ki];B[ih];W[hg];B[kh];W[lh];B[kg]
;W[li]LB[gk:A]TR[ch][dh][eh][ei][ej]SQ[fk][fl]C[Dieter:  I thought Black would now cut at A and I was prepared to let the cutting stones

Jon:  He'll have to back down and connect back to his other stones eventually, but he can bide his time by attacking the triangle-marked stones first.]
;B[fh];W[ig]C[Dieter:  I was proud of this move. It takes care of the capturing race while making and destroying shape.

Jon:  Nice find!  That's exactly right.]
(;B[jh];W[je]LB[id:A]C[Dieter:  Here I decided to drop all my tails. Too cowardly?

Jon:  Nah, it would be very annoying if black poked through at A, so your decision is reasonable here.  You can also save the one your opponent doesn't take, so it's not a total loss.]
;B[eg];W[el]C[Jon:  I'd omit this exchange for now, it could be a good ko threat later.]
;B[dk];W[le];B[ib];W[jb];B[pq];W[pr];B[nr];W[or];B[rp]LB[op:A]
TR[pm][qm][pn][po]C[Dieter:  This is a mistake

Jon:  Yeah, black would be better off trying to separate the marked white stones.with A.]
;W[nq];B[mr];W[no]LB[nm:A]C[Dieter:  Bcause I save my stones while making eyeshap.

Jon:  Not only that, you also have the threat of white A next.  White's happy about that!]

(;B[lg]LB[nm:A]C[Jon:  Black will want to fix the weakness at A as soon as possible, it'll be quite painful if he doesn't.]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[ni];B[me];W[mc];B[ld];W[fe];B[gc];W[fg];B[fi]
;W[nm]C[Dieter:  Now the aji in Black's position comes to surface. Otherwise I think the game was very close.

End of my comments.

Jon:  Without black's error, it was definitely worth continuing.  Black was behind, but not too far.

Key points:

1.)   The overextension at move 12 (white J-3) was the main issue in regards to what caused white to fall behind in the opening.  Longer extensions like these tend to require a more powerful source of strength to support it.

2.)  At the start of the fight on the right side, move 52 (white R-16).  This was one of the spots where white fell behind during midgame, as black was allowed to build the right side without too much contest (at the time).

3.  The decision at move 90 (white P-13).  Because it would be very hard to contain the black stone at F-10, it'd be worth making a smaller move to ensure no problems arise.  In the long term, it would also help your center potential.  Once it was set into motion though, it was very hard to stop from coming into that potential.

Thank you very much for allowing me to review your game!  I hope you enjoyed my commentary, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.]

(;W[lp]C[Jon:  If white tries to prevent black's stones from getting a footing along the side:]
;B[jm]C[Jon:  Black can move out easily.  He's got plenty of room to move around, so he doesn't feel threatened at all.]
))
(;W[jq]LB[kr:A]C[Jon:  The slide to A feels unnecessary low to me, so I'd recommend turning.]
;B[lp];W[kq];B[mn]C[Jon:  White's stones feel more comfortable now, having more room to move around.]
))
(;B[od]C[Jon:  Expanding along the top by approaching the top right corner is appealing to me.  With white's 3-3 stone being so close to the edge, it'll be easier for black to press against it for leverage.  There's also plenty of time to deal with white's structure on the bottom, it'll take more time for white to develop it because of the longer extension.]
)
(;B[dj]LB[iq:A]TR[dd][dp]C[Jon:  The left side also comes to mind, but I'm not as happy about it.  It's working more efficiently with the two marked black stones, but black will have trouble expanding along the sides to build a framework.  White's already on one side with the stone at A, and it's his turn, so he can continue adding pressure.]
;W[fc]C[Jon:  Once white approaches the top left corner, black is flattened to one side while white is expanding nicely along the top and bottom.  Black doesn't feel too good about this!]
