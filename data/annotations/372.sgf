 lucy 12k*: adjourn and watch game 35 ok :)];B[dc];W[dp]C[
 lucy 12k*: nice game :)];B[ce];W[op]C[Moves up to 6 excellent.];B[jd]C
[Black 7 is a fine point that is hard to criticize.  But white 8 is also excellent.  One would be tempted to play black 7 at white 8  as it is an extension both from Q16 and stops t
he extension from the white shimari, thus a double purpose move.  Whereas K16 is only a single purpose move.  But a darn good single purpose move.]
;W[pj]
(;B[fq]C[Black 9 is fine.  Black 9 around D10 seems to build an
ideal  moyo for black.  Since this is a no komi game, I think black
should play D10 without hesitating.  It would be hard for white to take
the lead after black D10.];W[hq]C[A
 white pincer at 10 is appropriate, to work in conjunction with the white shimari and build a moyo.  Black's choice to jump out at 11 is usally slightly inferior but here I think it is the best choice.]

(;B[fo];W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[Black 13 is a mistake.  Black should leave open the option of invading at a for later.  Also, black's shape is a little funny.  See a joseki book.]
;W[cq];B[io]C[Black 15 is, again, a little awkward shape.    Concerning white 16:  The lower side of the board is currently the direction of play.  This is white's moyo.  White should pressure the black invading stones so as to build up territory while threatening to kill.  With another move here, black could settl
e black's stones, destroying white''s moyo, and securing a comfortable lead.]

(;W[nc]
(;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[White 20 should be at M17, one space to the white.  L17 forces K17, which is a favor to black (and leaves L17 short a liberty and weak).]
;B[jc];W[ne];B[og];W[qh]
(;B[qg];W[pm];B[mg]C[See previous comments.  Black is happy.  We can conclude that Q7 was a slow move.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[dj]C[Black should probably play M18.  White's upper g
roup does not look alive yet.  I don't think white can afford to tenuki.  Black could consider N16 or N17 but they do not look so good.]

(;B[dl]C[Obviously the upper and lower sides are big and the right side is not important, as previously noted.  Locally, however, D10 should have been at C10, as the stone at C15 undermines D10's high position.  Since black can settle the stones  at the bottom with another move, D10 cannot be used to attack the black stones.

Black 33 seems like an overplay.  M18 or K3 seem right.  Maybe M18 then K3, as I think black gets sente after M18.

The psotion as it stand now is pretty diffiuclt to find the biggest move.  A splitting move between black 33 and F5 seems right, though.  Black is weaker, so a contact move should be avoided.  Maybe E7 is right.  I'm not sure.]

(;W[fn];B[eo]C[I think white should block at E6.  Otherwise black E6 seems too painful.]

(;W[do];B[en]
(;W[gn]C[No go player should miss E7.  This is too big!]
(;B[go];W[dg];B[dm]C[It really seems like D7 should be at E7.  I looked ahead a few moves and black leaves this key cutting point unprotected for awhile.  This might come to haunt black.]
;W[fl]C[White 42 should probably
 cut immediately.  This cut is probably white's last chance to win.];B[bm]
C[In situations like this, C2 is usually the best move to live.]
(;W[bn];B[cm];W[dq]C[Note that white 46 forms an empty triangle.  On bad shape principles, it should be rejected unless you have _read_ an urgent need to play it.  C2 is better.]
;B[er];W[cr]C[See - the exchange
 of C2 for E3 was favorable to black.  If white played C2 first, then black played E2, there is no way white would respond with D3.  It is almost as if white has lost an entire move.]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[fk]
(;W[gd]C[G16 is in the middle of nowhere.  It almost seems like white thinks white is attacking.  It's black who is powerful here.  White needs to settle groups, not make more weak ones.  If white wants complications, and it looks like white is b
ehind and needs them, I suggest the cut at E7 which black has inexplicably left for white.]
