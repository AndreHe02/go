C[>The entire game I felt like I was being pushed around. When to attack and when to defend is a concept that eludes me.

I'll Label all your comments with '>' And my comments will just be there :)

Well, your attacking and defending was hard to distingush as such, but I did provide variations that were better. THen only problem with your playing is that I don't think you took time to observe the rest of the board while playing. Your opponent kept you on the sides and took the center for himself as you played along wihtout knowing it. I think you could mainly improve by keeping an eye on the global position of the game, and playing after seeing that. 

I think another problem is that you let black develop your corners while his remained untouched. Remember to try and evenly spread your stones throughout the board in the opening.]

Well, the opening isn't done yet, but remember, with O's you've made an OK territory, and your A still has B creating a moyo.]

[no][np]C[Well, you played a good game. My main suggestion is just to start reading ahead. There's alot of info on how to get started in reading on Sensei's Library (a partner of the GTL).
Reading is the best way to improve in Go. In case you have trouble getting on the internet regularly, I'll provide a lesson in starting to read.

Ok.. Problems help immensely. Goproblems.com has tons of 'em. Getting books from various companies (Kiseido has them for 15$ US per book) is a good way to get non-electronic problems. 

Reading can also be improved by simply looking ahead a move. The best way to this is: In your mind, place your next stone. That's it. Once you've done this a bit, or if you catch on quickly, place the stone mentally, then think of how your opponent could counter that move, then adjust your plans accordingly. Using this technique alone will get you up a few levels. If you have problems slowing down your mind, then simply take your hand off the mouse. This may sound wierd, but this is so when you see what you think is a good move, you won't immediately click there, you have to take a few seconds to see if that move works or not. And usually with 30 minute games, time is not an issue (I personally find 20 minutes to be a bit much sometimes, but that's just me ^^)

Thanks for letting me reveiw, it was fun.
