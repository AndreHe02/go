C[Dear Jeff,

Nice game. There were some mistakes which added up to losing in the end, indeed, but untill move 91 the game was even. 
I pointed out some mistakes and made some suggestions. You should try to asses better the strenght of your positions, and make use of this strength.
Hope it is useful.

(;B[fc]C[After i played this move i didn't like it. It just seems kind of wrong but on the other hand im not sure were i should have played.



F: I think this is a good move. Alternative would be C17 of D17. See variations]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[hd]C[this looks like such a bad result for me



F: No, not bad at all. You have a stable group, which can make two eyes if necessary. White must take care of a black invasion on M17 and later you might be able to invade at san-san (C17). You are invading in white's moyo, so you can't expect to have it all.]
;W[pb]C[F: White must defend here];B[qc];W[ne]MA[ld][lc]C[F: But this is overdoing things a bit. M16 of M 17 would give a better balance to the white group]

(;B[mq]C[F: This is not a bad move, but you've got a chance on the upperside now because of white's overplay on O15. See  variation]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[gh];B[dg]C[F: This only strengthens white];W[cg]
;B[jc]C[F: This is what white wants. You help him to settle his group on the upper side.]
;W[kc];B[ic];W[kb]
(;B[kd]C[bad for me i think kind of overplay



F: Yes, probably better at J 14 or so];W[je];B[ed]C[F: And this is also what white wants, make his corner sure territory.]
;W[eb];B[ef];W[ee];B[ff];W[eg];B[dh];W[ci]C[F: So, instead of attacking white, you were attacked and your group doesn't even has two eyes.]

(;B[hh]C[F: You can't catch this stones, so better pulling out the other ones]
;W[gi];B[hg];W[hi];B[jh];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[ek]
TR[dg][dh][eh][dj]C[F: Escaping with the marked stones is probably to risky]
;W[el];B[fl];W[fk];B[em];W[ej];B[dm];W[ek]C[F: Nice squeeze, but you lost 4 stones.]
;B[go];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]C[felt kind of lost here. Thought i could have gotten a better result then i did. variations would be appricated here. i was thinking just being simple and playing q5



F: Yes, here you're giving away a lot.  What white plays is a kind of standard invasion of the corner]

;W[le];B[ld];W[me];B[kg];W[lf];B[ie]C[F: After catching this stones, and making your group alive, you're back in the game. Much depends now on how many points you can make in the centre]
;W[kq]
(;B[ko]C[F: Not good. You're strong on the right side, so you should use this strength to attack. See variaion
