C[Hello and many thanks to the reviewer. This is a game I've lost by 12 points (it would have been closer if it wasn't for an end-game blunder). I think I played decently (for 14k - i'm struggling between 14 and 15k at this time).

I played black in this game.

Thank you very much,

;B[pj];W[dj];B[jp]C[Black 7 is often played at F3 or F17, but K4 is playable also.]
;W[jd];B[jj]C[Q: is this move any good? I thought that if the positions were similar this would help me get ahead.

A: k10 is playable but you leave the initiative to white. It's normal for black to be ahead since black moved first.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[Black R14 is not consistent with your fuseki (opening) strategy based on influence, not territory. Q14 would be better here (see variation).]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[Again Black is not consistent. If you like making territory with moves such as R17, then don't play the first 5 moves as you did. Since you played low (R14) at the previous move, R13 is not that big now. R17 would have been the correct move if you had played Q14 at the previous move.

In this position, you could play F3.];W[hq]
(;B[fq]C[Q: this is probably too agressive. I was lucky to get into the corner towards the end of the sequence.

A: to be consistent with your opening strategy, play H5 instead (see variation). Your goal is not to get in the corner, since your strategy is center-oriented. If you reall want the corner, invading at C3 is simpler.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[ep]C[If the goal is to live in the corner, just go to C3 directly, don't atari: this helps the opponent. (See variation).]
;W[fo];B[dq];W[eo]
(;B[cp]C[black would like to connect but this doesn't work well (see variation). This shows that E4 was a very bad move.]
;W[eq]C[this is disastrous for black. now all white stones are connected, and black g4 goes to waste.]
;B[cq];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[pq]C[Q: this is probably too slow. But I thought I should consolidate the area. Q3 would have been better?

A: yes, too slow. Q6 is better, to be consistent with k10. You could also invade in sente at C17 since K10 will help reducing white's resulting influence. O15 would be good too.]
;W[ne]C[good point for white (would have been good for black too :-)]
;B[og]C[should be one point to the left (O13)];W[bm];B[fc];W[ec]
;B[fd];W[cg]
(;B[ff]C[The standard move in this situation is H16 (see variation)]
;W[fb]C[Q: The next sequence is very good for me, I think.

A: yes white could have been more severe];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc]
TR[jd][nc][ne][pb]C[Q: my black group is now much stronger. W got a big corner. I feel I can attack the W group on the right (marked). Can I?

A: you cannot hope to kill the group. you can take advantage of white's weaknesses, but not necessarily immediately. This depends on white's next move.]
;W[mq]C[Q: Should I have answered this?

A: Yes. Attacking the isolated white stone is more profitable than attacking the white group above which is not that weak.]

(;B[ld]C[Q: better ways to attack?

A: yes, attack the isolated stone at the bottom, see variation.]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[lb]LB[kd:a]C[Q: Cutting at A wasn't better for white?

A: yes];B[kd];W[kb]
(;B[md]LB[jc:a]C[Q: Should have been A?

A: N16 was ok, but your F17 group becomes weaker so you must be careful.]
;W[jc];B[nd];W[je];B[lg]C[Q: At this point I feel I'm doing better than W.

A: yes, M13 was good and W made mistakes.];W[oc];B[od];W[mo]

(;B[qm]C[R7 is too submissive. You must strengthen K4 and attack the white group (see variation).]
;W[jn]TR[gp][jp]C[Q: In the next sequence I try to pull out my marked stones (one of them, maybe) (or at least threaten to do so, in order to reduce the w teritorry there.

A: yes but you shouldn't be in this defensive position. You should have taken care of K4 before. And don't be concerned about G4, it is worthless. Only K4 was important.]

(;B[ln]C[wrong point, should be at M4 (see variation)];W[lo]
;B[hn]C[white is very strong in this area, don't play so close to his strength.]
;W[ko]C[white could have attacked more strongly, at J7 for example.]
;B[hl];W[io]C[If white wanted to play J5, he should not have played L5 at the previous move. white is overconcentrated now.]
;B[ll]C[M8 is rather vague. It doesn't close the center.];W[nm]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nk];W[oo];B[po];W[om];B[pl];W[or];B[pr]C[Black is often too submissive]
;W[fl];B[ce]C[This is probably an overplay];W[cd]C[But white is very kind :-)]
;B[df];W[bd];B[dg];W[bf];B[qb]LB[jg:a]C[Q: Probably this should have been around A. Is it so?

A: R18 is big, but you should at least play J18 in sente first to ensure the safety of your left group. "A" (K13) would be good then.]
;W[jg];B[ib];W[jb];B[oa]C[what is black doing? Giving many points to white, wasting potential ko threats, ...]
;W[pa];B[ma]C[N19 is bad too.];W[mc];B[nb]C[Q: this is probably wasted.

A: yes.];W[hf];B[fg]LB[gg:a]C[F14 should be at A (G13) if you want to attack white and defend against white E15 at the same time.]
;W[hh];B[gj];W[kh];B[lh];W[hd];B[gd]C[G16 doesn't make an eye since W can still play E15 and H19.]
;W[he]C[W could have been more agressive.];B[fi]C[Black is happy to link, but still not completely alive.]
;W[ki];B[li];W[kj];B[lj];W[kk];B[lk];W[hj]LB[ee:a]C[Q: I think w got ahead here.

A: yes, black could be in trouble if W had played at A (E15).]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[il];B[im];W[jl];B[fm];W[el];B[ee]C[Play directly at D11 instead.]
;W[be]C[W is too kind to answer here.];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[dh];W[bj];B[ej];W[dk];B[ho]C[H5 is gote and thus not very big.]
;W[hp]C[W need not answer here.];B[go]C[G5 is much too small at this point! O2, R19, E2 are much bigger.]
