C[[atje\] Hi, my name is Casper Zijlstra and I'm plating white in this game. I usually play too defensive and I tried to play more agressive this time. I didn't like the opening in this game, but I had the feeling my opponent didn't allow for a "regular" one (going for the large moves instead of immediatly starting with fighting).

Could you just point out general hints to improve my play? Thanks a lot in advance for reviewing this game!]

(;W[ql]C[[atje\] This is probably too small, but I didn't know how to defend the stone at R6 otherwise.

[Sarge\] Its not that its too small, just not correctly positioned. You play so that your 1 stone jump is pre-peeped; it is obvious that black will play at r7]

(;W[sp]C[[Sarge\] This move is very small, and not worth it at this point. Consider the difference in gain by playing this move, or another like R10, or anywhere else on the board.]
;B[sq];W[so];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri]
(;W[qi]C[[atje\] Usually I defend with T11, but I figured my group was alive anyways, so I'd give it a try.

Black allready has a large wall in the center, which I didn't like.

[Sarge\] You are right as again, T11 would be much too small of a move. I think ive shown how you could avoid giving black the huge wall.]
;B[rh];W[pk]C[[Sarge\] A tip for beginners; dont atari just for the sake of it. Here, it actually huts you since you end up getting R11 captured and giving black a lot of strength towards the top. You manage to separate his groups, but they both seem alive so this doesnt do much.]

;W[jj]C[[Sarge\] this is somewhat useful in nullifying his wall, if it lives]

(;W[ek]C[[Sarge\] I dont understand the point of this play. The connection at f9 was still safe before, so this is pretty pointless]

(;W[dq]C[[Sarge\] This atari is not going to work. Typically surrounding a stone like this is not the most efficient use of three moves.]

;B[cj];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab];W[ne];B[hf];W[tt];B[tt]C[[Sarge\] Overall, the main thing I would try to improve is to try and not get bogged down in contact fighting so often, and to make sure you dont create too many cutting points. You like to use contact plays to both attack and defend. Often there is a bigger move available. Also, try not to defend with contact plays. They strengthen both groups and thus make the attacking group stronger as well. 

For this paticular game, remember being aggressive doesnt necessarily mean lots of close fighting, you can also be more like you opponent and make bigger moves. If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.]
