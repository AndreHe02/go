(;B[pn]LB[np:a][mq:b]C[B13 is the first questionable move.  There were other options for W12 but the move played was acceptable.  This B13 is definitely wrong .  The attachment should be reserved for  when you are trying to settle the shape quickly.  There is no need for this in this case.  In fact, B does not want to settle if quickly.  He played here first and so should have the advantage. 'a' and 'b' are the natural moves.  A pincer would not be good without an extension along the bottom.   See variation.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[ql]LB[qo:a][ro:b][qp:c]C[This is the first time I have ever seen this move.  It is definitely bad. 'a','b', and 'c' are the usually moves with 'a' being by far the most common.  'a' is the key point in this shape.  If B gets it he has excellent shape. If W gets it he is threatening to push and cut.]
;B[qo];W[rn]C[This just emphasizes how bad W16 was.  W has had to take gote and has gotten a bad shape as well.  However, it is necessary to make shape and preserve the option of jumping into the corner.]
;B[mq]LB[rp:a][jq:b][fq:c][cn:d]C[Too small.  W can jump in at 'a' and so the corner is not very big.  B should extend to 'b' if he is going to extend.  However, the shape in the lower right is very resilient so B can consider extending all the way to 'c'.  If W responds to this with 'd' then B can make good shape along the bottom.  If W pincers against 'c' then B makes good shape with 'd'.]
;W[qi]LB[qj:a][qf:b]C[Too small. Although a B move at 'a' would restrict this group it is not under severe threat and this move simply is not big enough. If W plays on this side he should go all the way to 'b'.]
;B[cn];W[fp]LB[hq:a][gq:b]C[This move is not viable.  It is usually played in preparation for a later attack against B21.  In this case that would not be practical.  All it does it leave a weak point at 'a' for B to aim at.  'b' is the correct response. In fact, a play at 'b' would have been better than W20.]
;B[iq]LB[hq:a][eq:b]C[Not severe enough.  B should extend all the way to 'a'.  This move leaves an invasion point behind it (as does 'a') but it does not threaten 'b' as much as 'a' would]
;W[qf]LB[nc:a][jd:b]C[Wrong side. Wa, B24, Wb would be better.  This is a small extension from a stable group and is the sort of move which should not be made this early in the game.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc]LB[nd:a]C[The 25,27 combination is usually contradictory.  25 is intended to make W heavy and 27 is then usually played at 'a' to keep the pressure on W.  B27 is ok (although I would play at 'b'), but B25 is unnecessary.  It can always be played later if W does not respond to 27 and if W does respond then B has sente.]
;W[cl]LB[bp:a]C[Too early.  W must strength his two stones below first with a move at 'a'.]
;B[dl]LB[cp:a][cq:b][do:c][ep:d][en:e]C[Unreasonable.  If B attaches at 'a' first (not really the best move) he can then try this after Ba,Wb,Bc,Wd.  I would recommend jumping to 'e' and keeping W separated. The two stones below are still open to attack,]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dn];B[bl]LB[co:a][cp:b]C[B should exchange 'a' for 'b' first as a W play at 'a' is too good.]
;W[el];B[dk]C[.];W[ek]LB[co:a][em:b][cq:c][bn:d]C['a' is better. This W doesn't really achieve much because of the cutting point at 'b'. 'a' would secure the corner.   After 'a', W could answer 'c' with an atari at 'd' and keep B separated.  It is worth noting that, if B had captured a stone with B35 then this atari sequence would not be possible.]
;B[ej];W[kc]LB[lc:a][em:b][fj:c][co:d]C[Bad for two reasons.  First, if W extends here he must go all the way to 'a' so as to threaten an invasion of the corner.  However, leaving the lower left at this stage is wrong.  There is a cutting point at 'b' , and the hane at 'c' and 'd', all of which are vital points in the shape in the lower left.  You should not leave a situation which still needs to be played out unless you have good reason.]
;B[nf]C[This is also wrong for the same reasons as given for W38]
;W[kp]LB[em:a][ic:b][io:c]C[Let's assume that B gets the cutting point at 'a' (W is not trying to defend it so it is a fair assumption).  Suppose also than B gets an invasion around 'b'.  If this were to happend then W38 would be a weak group and W34&w36 would be a weak group.  B has no weak groups.  W cannot afford to create another W group by playing at 40. If B responds at 'c' that is exaclty what he may end up with.  2 weak groups against 0 weak group is usually a sure loss. 3 against 0 is suicidal.  Maybe B won't get to make all the plays suggested but as long as W has weak group he will have trouble stopping them.  Look at the variation for the next move.]

(;B[kr]LB[io:a]C[See the discusssion for the previous move. B should definitely play at 'a'.  The variation should is just one way it could go. This B41 is very cowardly and deserves punishing.]
;W[ip]C[suddenly W's center stones feel as thought they are connects.]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[gq];W[fq]LB[gp:a]C[Questionable.  W is open on the left so there is not a lot ot territory there. connecting at 'a' would remove a weak point and create a very strong position in the center.]
;B[gp];W[go];B[ho];W[jp]C[Excellent move.]
(;B[id]LB[hn:a][ic:b]C[The game is in the middle of a crucial fight at the bottom and B suddenly plays tenuki.  This does not make sense. B must play 'a'. (see variation)  If he must invade, 'b' is stronger.]

;W[kd];B[he]LB[hb:a][ja:b][gd:c]C[Ba, Wb, Bc captures the stone in a ladder and W still needs another move to make 2 eyes.]
;W[gd]LB[ff:a]C[B has been outplayed here. The 4 stones facing the center are not achieving much as W can easily jump out at 'a'.  There is even an outside chance that they make become the target of an attack.]
;B[in]LB[hn:a]C[As shown earlier, 'a' is better.];W[kn]LB[lo:a]
[gn:b]C[As shown earlier, Wa is sente so W has several options here. Making shape with 'b' looks better.]
;B[il];W[jm]LB[kl:a]C[W is weak to the left so he should not strenghtn B like this. 'a' is adequate although a strong player would probably try to settle the lower group on the side without forcing B to place in the center]
;B[im];W[jl]LB[ll:a][nl:b][ij:c]C[This is not the way to attack. Or is W trying to play to live?  It is not clear,  Direct moves like this are rarely good unless one is scrambling to live. Jumping away lightly with a move like 'a' looks better.  It threatens follow up moves at 'b' (immediate) and 'c' (future)]
;B[ij]C[Excellent move.];W[jk]LB[ik:a][gn:b][em:c][ff:d]C[Forcing B to connect only strengthens him. Leaving a cutting point at 'a' may be useful later.   A move at 'b' both threatens a' and helps the cut at 'c'.  However, 'd' is looking big.]
;B[ik];W[ke]LB[ff:a]C['a' is bigger.  This point is likely to end up as dame.]
;B[fm]C[Disastrous.  W should have been concerned about the cutting point for a long time and here is B forcing him to connect it.]

;W[ig]LB[ff:a];B[kf];W[jf]C[The whole sequence from here until B97 is very questionable.  Each side seems to be giving the other every oportunity to take advantage of the siutation but neither does.  W leave a lot of weak points which B did not take advantage of.]
;B[hg]LB[hf:a][gf:b]C[Dangerous, because of 'a'.  Just playing at 'b' is much better shape.]
;W[kg];B[lf];W[lg];B[mg];W[mh]LB[li:a][ni:b]C[Better at 'a' although a black response at 'b' would severaly limit the side]
;B[nh]C[B must cut.]
(;W[mi]LB[lh:a][hf:b]C[Neither player is taking advantage of the situation here. This W leaves a cutting point at 'a'.  Look also at the variation starting at 'b']
;B[ki];W[li];B[ni];W[nj]LB[lk:a]C[Seems like W is doing his best to give B enough cutting points to kill something.  Must be at 'a']
;B[lj]C[And B is doing his best not to cut at those cutting points..  Don't think in this situation.  Just cut and then worry about it.  That is not advice I wold give stronger players, but at the 13k level it is sound.]
;W[mj];B[lk];W[ll];B[ml];W[mk];B[kj]LB[mm:a]C[This move doesn't make sense.  What is it protecting?  Play at 'a'.  W does not have two eyes at the bottom, which shows that W did noy have time to cut at 102]

Both players missed countless opportunities to play sente and double sente moves which would have won the game for them.  In particular W's invasion of the lower right corner was a loosing play. After that, the large ko in the middle near  the end seemed almost incidental athough W would probably still have won without the mistake which caused the ko.   There were a lot of missed opportunities early in the game for both players but, given the rating of 13k, perhaps most of these are understandable.
