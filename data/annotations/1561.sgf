;B[hp];W[nq]TR[qj]LB[np:A]C[phi: Because you already have a stone on R10 you can answer this move (O3) with O4. This is a bit more agressive, but makes a strong wall towards your stone on R10.  See variation on move 12.]

(;B[qn];W[kp];B[jq]LB[lr:A][dr:B]C[phi: its always good to have a base.
This move is good because it serves two things:
a) make your own base
b) threaten to take the base of the two white stones playing A (M2).]

[mp:D]C[was thinking of either this O6 or N5, at my level, cant seems to evaluate accurately which option to take, please comment

phi: both moves (O6 and N5) give your opponent the possibility to press further.
N5 is somehow better, because your oponent just can atack in gote.
If you play on O5 you are safe. (See variations to move 22)

In my eyes you have chosen the weakest point of the three.

D (N4) is another possibility, but very agressive. It lets your oponent split you apart.]

(;B[nn];W[mp]
(;B[no]C[phi: to save a single stone is not worth playing. Except you can connect or split a group.
See variation to Move 24: You have sente and you can invade on C17 for example.]

(;W[lp]C[phi: this is too slow and concentrated.  White could play on L5 (see variation on move 25) and stays connected to N4.]

;B[eq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr]C[decided not to coverup E2, rather, take this opportunity to attack on white-6
phi: true, to save D2 gives nearly no points. But the white moyo on the left side realy big.]

(;B[dm]TR[fl][dg]LB[fl:A][dg:B]C[phi: this is dangerous. White could seal you in playing on F8. This could lead to a big fight.
If you atack D10 from the weaker side, you have more possibilities to escape on a counter-atack.
See variations to Move 40 and 41.]
(;W[dn]C[change mind and decide to run towards the centr
phi: seems to be your last chance.];B[fm];W[fn];B[hl];W[hm]
;B[jl]LB[dg:A][qc:B]C[phi: white does not have to respond to this. But its an important move anyway, because
it helps lining up your endangered stones on the left.
White could ignore this move and play on D13 to secure his/her own teritory or invade on
the right side (eg. R17). See variations to move 47.
What I want to say: Your move was good, but white had better possibilities to answer it.]

(;W[im]C[back to attacking white-];B[dh];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[fk]
;W[cf]LB[ei:A]C[phi: black has to be aware of the cut at A (E11).]
;B[df];W[de]C[decided to use this move to lure oponent to kill it, so i can built a strong presence on the inside.

phi: white has a more intresting alternative as to capture your stone on C10: See variation to move 61.]
;B[cj]LB[ck:A][ci:B]C[phi:
good: this is a standard tactic to connect two gropus like D8 and D12.  White can try to attack black from two positions, but black has always the
other oportunity to connect. (See variation to Move 57.)]
(;W[ck];B[dk];W[ci];B[di]
(;W[bj];B[ej];W[ch]LB[jc:A][rd:B][qc:C]C[again, felt that there could be a better move option to both contain the white on the left side and also to form some relationship with black-

phi: Possible to extend to K17. This extends form N17.  Secure the upper right corner with S16 could be another urgent move.
White has still the oportunity to invade on R17.];B[ff];W[dg]
;B[eg]
(;W[ef];B[fh];W[fe]LB[mc:7][jd:A][jc:B]C[try to igonre the attack of white-70 and quickly for an attacking force with black-7 to force a respond from white

phi: I am not sure if this was an attack. Probably white defended the corner. So you keep sente and I thik you found the right move.
I personaly prefer the 3rd line, if my oponent already stays on the 3rd line.]
;B[jd]
(;W[ic]C[phi: white could enter the big center playing G14.
See variation to Move 71.  The center nomaly does not give many points.]
;B[hd]LB[id:A][gf:B][he:C][jc:D]C[phi: this lets white enter  the center at many weak points (A, B, C).

I personally prefer a more defensive strategy when I am ahead.
As black I wold have played on B(G14) or D(K17).];W[hc];B[he]
;W[qg]C[phi: Blacks moyo is too big. White definitly has to do something.
Probably this invasion is late. But white made some mistakes later on.]
;B[pg]C[phi: This lets your oponent make a base at the right side.
You protect the center, but this is not so important, because the center is still open (G14).
See variation to move 77.]
(;W[pf]C[again, try to sacrifice this stone so that i can built a strong presence on the inside, not sure if it's a good move.

This is normally a good strategy. But you have to be aware that white might enter
somewhere into the center (eg. G14).  If white enters, you could loose nearly all of your points, because nearly all of your teritory is in the center.]
;B[qf];W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[phi: this forces your oponent to make a good shape.
Never force your oponent to make good moves.
Playing on S14 is an alternative. It splits the white group up.]
;W[rf]TR[rf][qe][pf][qg]C[phi: this shape (called pon-nuki) is very strong. It gives white the possibility
to make eyes.];B[of];W[qd];B[qc];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi];B[pj];W[pi]
;B[oi];W[og]C[phi: white forces you to make good moves.
I as white prefer making live for my group on the right side first.]
;B[qf]
(;W[oh]C[phi: This white move kills all further ko-threats.
Both of you have many ko-threats. See variation on move 93.
It would have been more intresting to play the Ko, because white has a lot of  ko-threats.]
;B[pf];W[ni];B[oj]
(;W[li]C[phi: white should not play here. Whites stones have no base, so they can be
atacked from all sides.
phi: white sould try to make two eyes on the right side first (eg. S17)
See variation on move 97.];B[ng];W[nh];B[lg]C[phi: good! Now you can attack the white stones from a distance.]
;W[mg]C[big decision for me, decide not to put a stone at O14, but here so as to contain white]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[le];W[ne]C[stop white from breaking out and so that O13 is a false "eye

phi: good.];B[oc]C[phi: now O13 is "false" and white has little possibility to make two real eyes.
Better: this move protects you to any future attacks on Q17.]
;W[lh]C[the strategy is to try to contain white so that it cannot create another eye]
;B[mj]C[this practically means that O14 is no longer a valid eye as it needs to be cover up to make N12 a valid eye]
;W[mi]C[phi: white has one eye.];B[kg];W[kh];B[kj];W[jh];B[ig]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[ji];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[sg]
(;B[ri]LB[rg:A][sf:B];W[rh]C[made a mistake as not to cover up on S1

phi: I don't think that white could be killed directly.
There is a possibility where you can make a ko (see variation on move 122).]
;B[se]C[the oponent somehow miss it? should have place it at S10 so that he'll survive, now these stones on the right hand side are dead

phi: you are right. Your oponent missed the point. S10 still makes live for your oponents stones.]

(;W[si]C[phi: this was the wrong move. White still has only one eye.
See Variation on move 125.];B[rj];W[nj];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl];W[ok]
;B[ql]C[phi: good: white will never make a second eye in this region.]
;W[ik];B[il];W[hk];B[gm];W[gn];B[rq];W[gk];B[en];W[eo]C[another mistake by me]
;B[fd];W[gf];B[fg];W[ge];B[ed]
(;W[ee]TR[ed][fd]LB[hh:A][gh:B][gi:C][hi:D]C[decided to give up on the two black stones 143 & 147 so that the white would not encroach anyfurther into black's teritor

phi: This was a good idea. Your move (149 on H13) prevents white form playing
around there.
White around ABCD (G11 to H12) has the potential to either  connect or to make a second eye.

Usualy its a good tactic to play "Tit-for-tat". That means in this situation:
If white enters my territory, I enter whites territory.
So you could have saved the two stones and enter the whites upper left corner.
You have many points to steal from white on the top (About 40 Points).
But If you can kill white in the center its much more: at least 60 Points.

So your decision was right, but late. White could play on A(H12) instead of E15.
See variation on Move 147.];B[hg];W[gd];B[jc];W[gi];B[ih];W[fj]
LB[ei:A]C[phi: White could have split the black group playing on A (E11).
But still white has only one eye (N12).];B[fi];W[gj];B[em]TR[fj]

[re][qe][qd]LB[lr:A][rr:B][ib:C]C[phi: ?? your game record ends here.
Didn't you play any further?

General remarks.

Black is far ahead. White lost two big groups.
Black has still many points to attack: A (M2), B (S2), C (J18).
Black has better tactical moves.
White should have entered the center earlier.
White: learn to play ko.])
