C[Reducing ok and the rest is endgame.

I think generally you lost the game via the sequences in the upper left corner and the bottom middle area i.e. the variations in the review.

For handicap games, certain tips I can give:
1. Don't play heavy shapes that you know that are weak and will certainly be cut of or shut out from the center of the board. You are outnumbered in handicap games and black's sole objective is to attack, attack and attack.
2. Try to avoid slow or heavy moves, play light and make shapes that have a lot of eye shape/potential eye shape.
3. Try to make dual purpose moves i.e. which move creates a base and probes a corner/creates a cutting point/...

Also one or two general remarks:
Don't create situations were you reduce the liberties of your own stones i.e. the hane at the head of 2 stones situations which occured 3 times in this game and created a lot of problems for white. Also, always try to evaluatie if stones can de sacrificed or not and if enemy stones are truly captured i.e. the white stones at N5! Lastly, don't follow your enemy around too much, always evaluatie if you really need to answer at the local situation or if you can play tenuki.

I hope this review will be of help to you.
