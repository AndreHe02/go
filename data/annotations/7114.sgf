Hello,

I'm microlog, I play black.

In this game, there was a lot of aji, sometimes good for white, sometimes good for black : that was very interisting for me. I made lots of mistakes, in the fuseki, the chuban and the yose. After the game, I have to try to see some variations that you could see, but I prefer to have the eye of a better player.

Thanks for the review.

Hi I'm linux from Germany (4k). I will comment your game.

The game was interesting and both, white and black would be able to win it..

The opening contains sometimes one tenuki too much. So you has at the middlegame many weak groups.
You are missing to connect your groups at an early stage of the game.
Moreover there were many mistakes in reading out running fights.

(;B[qq]LB[jc:A][np:B][qq:1]TR[of][pf][og][oh]C[Linux: The marked white stones break the ladder  if white cut at A. You should protect this cutting point and take control at the white weak group (see variation)

At the other hand it is maybe better, to play 1 outside at B (see variation)]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[kq]LB[pm:A]C[Linux: If you dislike a white moyo at the bottom, you must not play this joseki (R3...). L3 have to play at A., because W will play it himself. (see variation)]

Play around A and try to connect your groups and 
then around B to take the initiative (whites P6 group is not save at all).

If white here plays at the center, he can (later) attack your bottom group also.
