(;B[ck]C[*Wrong direction. You should always attack from the weaker side, against the wall. This is an important concept in go.]
;W[cf]
(;B[hc]C[*defending here is not urgent. the shimari is solid and not easy to attack.]
;W[qk]C[is h17 enough compensation for r9. C9 feels a bit close but nessesary to play, i kind of like this sequence but i'm afraid of the weakness i create in the upper right corner. would like to know what could happen and why.

*H17 is rather small and not urgent. I feel like R9 is much bigger. I guess you mean the upper left corner with weakness, because in the upper right corner is only a white stone. Your shimari is a very strong shape and cannot be attacked directly. It will live comfortably no matter how white attacks.]

(;B[nc]C[*rather small, you are behind on territory, so you must invade.]

hane at the top of two stones is in most cases very bad for the one with the two stones.]
;B[ce];W[bj];B[bk];W[fh];B[gf]C[* slow, lower right corner is important.]

C[* attach moves strenghten both sides. s is already strong there, w is weak and a wall to the right side is just what he wants, so this is not a good strategy. P5 or something in that area would still be an adequate invasion.]
