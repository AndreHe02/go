C[Hello reviewer,

thank you for making your time for this. In this game I made some mistakes I have pointed out in this file and (of course) many more, that I don't even realize. I played for black, friend from Go club was white. The game was lost somewhere in the middle game, but we kept going just to see how it ends up, so we could decide on future handicaps. I will put my comments into brackets [ \].


M: Hi, I'm Marc, 1D, from germany but currently sttudying Baduk in Seoul, South Korea. (see: http://www.baduk-academy.com/forum/index.php )
If there are any questions left after the review, feel free to ask me on KGS (nick: MaLa) or join our forum and ask there. I will make a final comment at the end of the game about what i think, your weaknesses are and on what you should work, if you want to improve. comments by me are added with M: comment]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qo];W[pj]LB[qg:a]C[[Now I wasn't sure how to respond here, looking back,I should've attack that lone stone around A, since my two stones down are strong enough atm. Instead I played the way I did, ending up in gote\]

M: Actually, i prefer to play from below. I also asked some stronger players and most voted for playing from below how you did it in the game. Since the white stone is on the 4th line he is light anyway. I will comment about that later again.]
;B[ql];W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[M: This move is okay but i wouldn't play it, but i think, that is a matter of style.]
;W[jc]LB[kc:A][lc:B]C[Actually that white move is... halfbaken. Extending from a 3-3 stone is usually uncommon and regarded as uneffective, and the stone is not close enough to pressure the corner (should be on A/B then)
Still, the black top right corner is maybe alive, but already nearly surrounded. One should consider this in his further moves]
;B[jp];W[de]C[M: Another weird move. Trying to build some kind of moyo with an 3-3-opening has usually no chance for success.]

(;B[ph]TR[qf][pj]C[[I felt it was about time to bug those opened stones \]
M: First of all, this splitting move is the wrong one in this shape. This shape (triangled) occurs quite often, so you should better look at some variations here. As in the game, with that move you can hardly expect a good result. Further comments why this attack was too early in the variations.]
;W[qh]
(;B[pf]TR[le][me][ne][lf][mf][nf][lg][mg][ng]C[M: Now this is a serious direction mistake. This way, you get some thickness towards the triangled direction, but give away a lot of territory and the corner. You also help white to settle his stones now.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[qg]LB[rd:B][nh:a]C[[And of course, as expected, now I was confused. After some thought I chose to play on A, because otherwise W would lock me in corner.\]
M: Looks already pretty terrible for black. But when you want to keep the Corner, just play at at B]

(;B[nh]LB[pi:A]C[M: if you want to play here, this is still the wrong move. A would be atari for white and white could connect there all the time]

(;W[pe];B[qd]C[[this felt big enough and necesary\]

M: it is big, and probably necessary, but giving white that one stone there is painful. Now white is superstrong, blacks stone in the center look kinda lostand blacks attack completly failed.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[ne];B[mf];W[me]LB[oc:a]C[[Here I got seriously scared of invasion at A, so I defended. Luckily for me, my oponent took it as forcing move a responded (which I think was not necesary). Thinking about that now, there propably wasnt much to be afraid of.\]

M: there is nothing serious, you are right, but it was sente ;)]
;B[od];W[oe];B[lf];W[mc]
(;B[cn]LB[fp:b][fq:a]C[[Since it was quite obvious I was lacking out a lot, I attacked. I chose this side, because attack on A or B would only help W to strenghen his right side, while slowly overconcentrating my stones on bottom. Thinking about it now, i may have been fine - viz variation\]

M: First of all, there is no real attack here. It is just an approach, and it takes about 4 moves to really kill a single 4-4-Stone. So best you can epect is a share. Usually an attack should give the attacker a positive result while  a corner approach shares evenly. At the moment there is nothing of white you could attack severly, so approaching the bottmleft corner is still the biggest move on the board. But as you noticed yourself, the direction was wrong.]
;W[cj]C[M: you invites the pincer (and extension from the top), here it comes. Correct play by white]
;B[cp]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[M: black might play at A or B, but there are dozens of josekivariations. Since usually at your level both don't know that kind of joseki, you can play them, when you have a good intuition about such moves and their followups]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[[I was prpared to give up on left side in exchange for the right. So basicaly I am trying to do the same thing as in previous variation, only with much worse result\]

M: yes, but after approach from this side, i is hard to get a good result]

Final comment

Overall i think, your opponent was some stones stronger. I just marked the 4 mainmistakes of that game. 
(1) The hasty attack with the still open corner on the wrong point. 
(2) The bad continuation from that, instead of cutting
(3) The wrong side for the approach in the lower left. 
(4) The missing resistence to whites attack (and as you know now, that just made everything worse instead of safer)

Most of your mistakes were part of 3 categories: 
A) your mind often shifted, you played a move, your opponent played the obvious response and suddendly you changed your plan and made a completly different move, making your first move and the white counter looking bad (e.g. N9 and M11)
B) lacking sense of shape - that is just training, best way to study is to watch stronger players (like KGS 5d+ or professionals play, then usually the understanding for good shape comes by itself (e.g J15)
C) your positional judgement had no influence in your moves - from your comments, it looked like you noticed when you were behind etc. But if you do so, you should also think, what kind of consequences that has. Means, when being behind, also take some risks, try something etc. When you are ahead, play safe, etc. (e.g. #4)]

(;B[cm];W[bl];B[bn]LB[cl:B][en:A]C[M: At least some kind of resistance - you can jump to A at anytime and have another forcingmove at B. When you are ahaed by 30 points, maybe just defending is good enough otherwise you should not let you push around like this]

(;B[qh]TR[pj]C[M: This would be the correct move to attack here. But now we come back to my earlier comment about the open topright corner. and the fact, that the triangled stone is high.
