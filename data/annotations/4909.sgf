Hi, I'm GarouFH, your reviewer to this game. I'll do my best in order to answer all your questions.

Is this a good placement of stones for a handicap game?

Usually everyone put the stones in the hoshi (4-4 point), but you  can place them wherever you like. I would prefer to put in maked areas.

Triangule - These places where the standart stones are placed.

Circle - If you want to ensure some territory i can place there. This way you'll avaoid a invasion in san-san (3-3) point.

But don't worry, let's see how you continue the game.];W[ne]
;B[nf];W[of]C[How should I respond to a move like that?

In this point of the game, it's too early to fight. Try to ensure some territory.

You can play tenuki (tenuki means ignore oponnent's movement and play in somewhere else).

So you can play like this.]

;B[ld];W[pe]C[Odd shape, eh? How to fix that?

You are playing just to capture stones... Remember the manly goal of the game. In Go, you should conquer more territory than your oponnent.

But at this point you can force him to became more thick and you can remain with sente (sente means iniciative to attack, or something like that).]
;B[kg]C[Too agressive?

Nope, this is exactly a possible place to play. You have forced him to defend. Let's see what you have done after that.]

Yes, it would be better because you have a group in a serius threat.

The marked group jus have two liberties, so you should protect him!!!]

No problem. This was my first review I hope I can helped you. Let me give some advices:

1- Try to play so close and in contact (what means avoid tsuke);

2- Take a look in some Go websites to learn more about what you should do in the early game. Research about joseki and fuseki. Try to solve some tsumego (life and dead situations) too;

3- Keep playing, at least, once per day. Unfortunetely I can't do this, but if you do, you'll grow faster. Some people say that until you have played your 1000th game you won't learn enough about go.

Well, I think it's enough. Good luck for you and enjoy your games!!!

P.S.1- Don't mind too much about my bad english =p])
