C[Hagios: Since you didn't have any questions, I'll do my best to offer advice about the main points of the game.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dc]
(;W[de]C[H: I don't like this approach generally, as it lets black take the corner and white lacks a strong follow-up.]
;B[dp]C[H: I prefer this for black.]
(;W[fd]C[H: I worry that this choice leads to a situation where you have stones not doing much work.  This can lead to a loss of efficiency for white.  I would prefer to approach at f3 instead.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[op]LB[pn:B][oq:A]C[H: I would consider A and B first, for black.]
(;W[lp]C[H: This attack is best when you are able to build territory with your attacking stone.  In this case it seems that white should rather consider building territory to keep the balance.]
