C[CZR: Hi, my name is CaeZaR on kgs.  If you have any questions, please send them to CaeZaR.kgs@usask.ca.  If you find this review helpful, please do not hesitate to ask for me by name for your next gtl review.

My review philosophy:

A good kyu review should not address every error in play; rather, it should focus on the major errors in the game, especially those errors that are repeated.  As a kyu player myself, I am incapable of finding every error anyway.

I try to restrict my comments to those that I am confident in.  Never-the-less, as my play is error prone, I may make reviewing mistakes (miss bad moves and rebuke decent/good moves) and for that I do apologize.]

[iq][jq]C[CZR: I prefer a move in the marked area to this one (see move 9 comment).]
;B[jp];W[pj];B[jj]C[CZR: This opening does not favour W.  The reason is that B gets 5 of 9 big points while W gets 4 of 9.  In a game with a komi of 5.5, W would have compensation for this, but in this game where the komi is 0.5, W can not be satisfied with trading points in this manner as B will get the last one by default.  W should look to complicate the game from the outset.]
;W[jk]C[CZR: The top two fuseki (opening) priorities are:

1. Stake out zones of territory (usually corner, then side, then center).
2. Place stones at highly influencial positions on the board.

This move does not fit in either of these two catagories.  Rather, it attempts to attack B in the least important area of the board --- the center.  And it is gote, B can tenuki without feeling threatened.  B has good responces to any continued W attack.  See variation of move 12.]
;B[ce]C[CZR: B wisely tenukis.]
(;W[cd]LB[cd:1][ed:A][fd:B][de:2][cg:C]TR[dj]C[CZR: This exchange (1-2) is in B's favour.  His position is strengthened by your contact play and works well with the marked stone.  Instead, W can think about answering at 'A' or 'B' or with the pincer at or around 'C'.]
;B[de];W[dd]TR[dc][nc][oc][cm][dm][qm][cn][dn][qn][fp][gp][mp]
[np][fq][gq][mq][nq]C[CZR: W stones are not working efficiently.  This play makes the marked stone redundant.  W should look for an efficient move that satisfies the fuseki priorities.  Some ideas are marked.]
;B[hf]C[CZR: This B move is difficult to place in a fuseki catagory.  B's intentions are vague.]
;W[he]C[CZR: White enjoys this exchange of territorial 5th for influencial 6th line.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[ie];W[hd];B[gf];W[if]C[CZR: Leave non-urgent fighting for the middle game.  There are bigger moves to make (like the one B makes next turn).]
;B[ql];W[qm]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[CZR: This is too close.  A touching play like this will help B to settle his stone.  If you want to pincer, consider 'A' or 'B', but even these are difficult for W because he will be locally outnumbered.]

(;B[rg];W[sd];B[se];W[sg]C[CZR: You are attempting to kill a nearly settled group.  It only leads to B strengthening his stones and you getting nothing in return.]

;B[pc];W[pb];B[sc];W[sb];B[qb];W[rb];B[ob];W[qa];B[oc]C[CZR: B now projects great strength while W gets 3 points in exchange.  Not a good trade for W.]
;W[sd]LB[og:A]C[CZR: This play is worth 1 point.  Save it for the end of the game when there are no bigger plays to make.  Instead, maybe reduce B's influence by defending your cutting point at 'A'.  Or invade the lower left corner while it is still open.]

[gq][hq]C[CZR: I don't think this is a good place to invade as you'll be immediately weak after B plays his next move.  He has no weakness in his position now.  Instead, think about an invasion at the marked positions.]

;B[gn];W[ho];B[hp];W[hn]TR[hm][ho]C[CZR: All you have succeeded to do is give yourself a weak group.  For the next 40 moves, you try to defend the weak group you gave yourself.  Better B play would have captured this weak group in a heartbeat.]

;B[ik];W[in];B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[kn];B[jl];W[ln]C[CZR: Your only hope is to join your two groups.    I'll give my final commentary here as their is enough to think about here already.

1. In the opening, think about the priorities and make moves along those lines.
2. Remember, attaching to an opponent's weak stone typically makes it stronger.  Therefore avoid touching weak stones when you don't have to.
3. Have a reason to cut.  Your cut must leave your opponent with a weaker group than you, or it only serves in his benefit.

Keep playing, and try to read out your plays even a couple moves and ask if the outcome serves a purpose.]
