AB[pd][dp][pp]C[smonds3 [3d - KGS\] : I will be your reviewer. You asked many questions which I tried to answer. My comments are started with SM.  It seems that black lost because of fighting skills, missing certain tesuji and misunderstanding which stones are important. I hope my comments help. There was not much in 'direction of play' because this game involved mostly direct fighting (and capture races). 

Hi,
I played Black in a 3 stone game
against an opponent who beats me often. In this game I tried a different strategy and lost by about 25 points.  Some of this is due to tactical blunders, about which perhaps not much can be said; but I would particularly appreciate your input on strategic errors, wrong direction of play, overlooked urgent points, missed big points, or whatever you think I should know about.

I have included some specific questions, and some comments where I thought I knew what I was doing, but if too many questions,
then whatever you deem most important is fine, of course.
Thank you!];W[de];B[cj]C[The new straegy -- M. Redmond  proposes B2 to avoid 4-5 josekis
in handicap game; but maybe I should just get comfortable with some 4_5 josekis...

SM: It's a good idea. Especially in a 3 stone game, most moves will work. Furthermore, white will not simply enclose the corner now because in a 3 stone game, it would be much too slow. You can approach later then.]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[jp:A]C["Pincers are good in handicap games"

SM: I haven't heard that proverb, but I prefer a further pincer (such as A) to work with your 4-4 stone that is already developed. A near pincer is a little more severe, but provides less support to the D4 stone. Nevertheless, your move is perfectly fine.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[om]
LB[pn:a]TR[cc][qf][fp]C[Should I have pushed once more at A?

SM: This move is sometimes very nice and other times very slow. The simplest way to explain is to ask "How valuable (in points) is this move?" It is unclear the value, and it is not truly sente. All the marked moves have a more clear value. Also, if black omits this move, it is not likely that white will play in this area immediatly, therefore black may get this move later. In short, this move isn't urgent or big.

You should not have pushed once more. The joseki is complete, you should take sente to approach or enclose a corner it is biggest.]
;W[fq];B[hq]LB[iq:A][jq:B][lr:G][nr:C][ms:E][ns:D][os:F]TR[nq]
C[OK to pincer again this way?

SM: It is fine. It is also possible to pincer at A which reduces the amount of aji in the marked stone. Your current pincer leaves room for white to place at B later, which will activate the sequence C - G.  But again, your move is fine and good!]
;W[cn]LB[fp:B][cq:A]TR[cj][hq]C[SM: White is looking to play lightly and leave some aji on the bottom for later. It seems a good idea for a handicap game. BUT... If black is confident in fighting, it is time to do so. Black has thickness and two supporting pincers. See variation for a strong idea. Please see the variations here at A and B]

(;B[eo]TR[hq]C[Keep him separated!

SM: This is the first "mistake". This move does keep white separate, but with the marked pincer, this move is not appropriate. Black can do better. This move is also used to get black out into the center when he is under attack. Here, Black is not under attack because he has two pincers and thickness. 

Black can search for better options (as seen in variations).]
;W[cq]C[SM: White is happy to settle one stone and take the corner.]
;B[dq]LB[cj:c][cn:e][cp:a][hq:d][oq:b]TR[eo]C[Block at A instead?  I blocked this way because it was wider to B than to C.  But he got a very big territory along right side and corner, though I got a big center
moyo.  Is this valid or too risky?
Bad things happened to me later on that side.

Should I have thought, "Block at A because distance from corner to D gives him less room to make a live group while I can still chase E, which is caught in a looser pincer"  ?

SM: Honestly, it seems about the same either way. It is a little dissatisfying to have white connect to one stone and the other stone will be useful either way. I don't think the block is the mistake. The move at E5 was the mistake.
I really still don't know which way to block, in this position.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cp];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[jn]C[W29 seems too deep..., so 

SM: Yes, a little deep.];B[jl]C[Try to enclose it!

SM: It's a good idea.];W[mm];B[no]LB[mm:c][on:b][pn:a]C[This seemed right at the time, but now looks fishy -- I was worried, in part, about W moves at A or B.

SM: Yes, this move is a little slack.];W[mo];B[np]C[Seemed necessary, but..]
;W[mk]TR[jl][om]C[he's out.

SM: Yes. White escapres with little effort. Black has spent two moves now for no direct profit. This is how a handicap disappears.]
;B[ql]LB[qm:A]C[Intended to
1) Separate from side group, and 2)  Prepare to make B territory
on upper right side, if possible.
3) Don't let B's group get enclosed.

Reasonable?

SM: Yes, It is also forcing to play at A.];W[rm];B[rl]C[Too small? I was still thinking of possible territory on upper right -- where would I have played to continue pressure against W's center?

SM: This is loosing sight. There is not secure territory on the right. Furthermore, white has a center group which may be pressured, and the top two corners are yet to be addressed.]

SM: I don't see a good move, but this move is too passive again. Probably time to tenuki instead.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[em]C[I thought the cut-off stones would live on the side, but ultimately they didn't.

SM: Seems a white overplay to try this. Black eventually punished well and much of white died. White just needs to settle his center and be patient. White has two large corners and black's only territory is the bottom so white doesn't have to go all out here.]

It occurs to me now: after his response to B116, should I have played at (or very near)  A to attack the triangled  cutting stones,
