D3 is too easy for white to handle.

When you play D3, you can imagine white playing at C3. Once you do this, you can see that White C3 is very good for white.

Your opponent very good move is also your very good move.

So black should play at C3.];W[cq]TR[cp][ep][dq]C[

This is not the biggest move on the board.

It is also timid. Black should at least attack with A which aims at the invasion.

Always try to find the biggest move before playing: the top side is loooking very big, but it should be easy for white to establish a position with B.

This shape is not connected, Black needs to add stones for connection.

If you don't know which shapes are connected or not, you should try to put 2 stones on the board and expirement with cutting them.]

Yes, you must first tend to the connection (make yourself strong before attacking).

I think it is 8 points in sente, but I haven't done calculations.
