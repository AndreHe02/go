DT[1996-05-16]TM[780]KM[0.5];B[pc]C[EE: I believe you lost this game mainly because you
failed to use the bad aji left from a white tenuki, and you let his moyo grow
too large, by perhaps being too concerned about profit at the bottom and top.]
;W[dd];B[op];W[dp];B[fq];W[qp];B[pn];W[oq];B[pq]C[EE: The books usually say that a  favourable ladder (which comes many moves ahead) is recommended when  embarking  on this complicated joseki. Did you check the ladder? I think a hane on the  outside is a better choice of joseki in this position. The thickness you get  then cooperates well with the kakari you have made to the left.]

(;W[ql]C[EE: This move is a serious mistake.]
(;B[lr]L[jq]C[EE: Black has to play on the right side! For a move on the lower side, I
would prefer 'a'. Since #25 is on the second line, it invites White to push
down on Black while strengthening  himself. Since Black is so low, he doesn't get much cash in return. Another  aspect of Black's move being on the second line is that it makes the three  white stones lighter, so White can leave them behind for a while for the more  important  right side.]
;W[mn];B[pk];W[qk];B[lq]C[NM: It looked to me as if W had left his N3 group  weak, but I didn't see any very convincing attack ...

EE: This looks okay. M2 is a kind of double sente point.];W[lp];B[kp];W
[lo];B[mp];W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[mr];W[mp];B[ml]L[pj][qi]C[NM: Should N8 have been O8

EE: I would play Ba first to see how he answers. If he jumps to 'b', then N8  looks just right.]
;W[nm];B[pm]L[qj][ro]C[NM: Or was O8 now preferable?

EE: On O8, White plays P6 which captures the three cutting stones. A nice thing
about Q7 is that it fills a liberty, which makes 'a' possible, due to the  revived aji of 'b'.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[mj]L[nj]C[EE: The simple nobi  of 'a', not giving White any momentum, seems more appropriate here.]
;W[lk];B[oj];W[qi]L[lj]C[EE: It is understandable that White wants to play on this  side now, but he leaves very bad aji behind for his middle group (see  variation).
White should correct this bad aji at first opportunity, with 'a' for  instance.]

(;B[qj]L[qg][rj]C[EE: This appears to be aji-keshi. You might  later want to play for example Ba threatening the placement at 'b'. After  this exchange, which doesn't add much to Black's position, that choice is  gone.]
;W[rj];B[pj];W[rk];B[pg];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf]C[EE: Likely overplay.];B[qf]
;W[of];B[qh]L[qd]C[EE: Black must play 'a', to prevent White's breaking  though at the 4-4 point. That would give Black a lot of profit in the corner]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[pd]
(;B[oe]C[NM: I think P15 should have been at  R16.

EE: Agree - the ko is huge for both sides, but White would lose it if he  tries  to fight it.]
;W[od];B[ne];W[qc];B[nd];W[oc];B[re];W[qd];B[ri]M[of][pf]L[ng]C[NM: Should S11 have been at S13?

EE: Neither of those moves remove the aji of the two marked White stones. If  Black is going to spend a move defending, it is better to defend properly, at  'a' for instance.]
;W[rh];B[si];W[rg];B[og];W[fp];B[gp]M[ml]C[NM: Was G4 a good reply, or  should   I have tried say C6 to complicate matters?

EE: The aji of the marked stone is of great importance here, and should guide  Black's choice. G4 seems correct in view of that.]
;W[eq];B[fo];W[ep];B[fr]L[go]M[ml]C[EE: Dubious. Black should either move out with his cutting stone now,  or play 'a' as preparation for it. By giving priority to taking points at the  bottom, Black ends up in an overconcentrated shape there.]
;W[go];B[er];W[dr];B[hp];W[fn];B[ho];W[eo];B[cf]M[ml]C[NM: C14 is a move I'm dubious  about. Should it have been somewhere round
D10 to split the side?

EE: It makes sense to stay clear of the thickness White has below. You might  also try C11 (3rd line makes it easier to make a base). 10th line or lower  is asking for trouble. Of course, moving out with the marked stone is as  interesting as ever.]
;W[ch];B[cc]L[ef][fd][eh]C[NM: I didn't feel I was  strong enough to try my usual E14 - D11 sequence

EE: That was probably wise. a-b-c might be possible, though. Or a tsuke at  D12. The san-san invasion seems to be playing into White's hands, since he  gets a quite impressive moyo.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[bf];B[fc];W[ge];B[gc]M[nd][oc]C
[EE: I may be sticking my head out, but I would  like to seriously suggest, that in the special circumstances here, this  move isn't obligatory.
Here, the upper side is pretty worthless, since 1) The marked Black stone is  strong; 2) The marked White stone makes it open at the edge. Also, White is  building a large moyo which needs immediate attention. So I think it is at  least an interesting idea to play tenuki and do something about the moyo.   It is hard to evaluate the position due to the uncertain status of the N3  group, but the game is starting to look very good for White now.]
;W[dj];B[cq]C[NM: Was there a chance to jump in
here around D8?  If so, should I have?
Or should I have taken J9 to keep up
the attack on the N3 group?

EE: D8 looks like suicide. J9 isn't bad, but White will remove his bad aji  with M10 or around L8, after which the N3 group is fairly healthy. The way  to attack it is moving out with the cutting stone. C3 is an interesting move,  testing White's response (yosu-miru).]
;W[cp]C[EE: He answers safely, which  means you have gained the possibility to play a bigger endgame move here  *later*, not now!]
;B[cr]C[EE: Gote. :-(];W[hj];B[gg];W[hf];B[ig]L[ih]C[EE:  'a' seems better shape.]

;W[jl];B[il];W[jk]L[je]C[NM: Would it have been  worth taking O17 now? My instinct was that that wasn't worth taking
gote for, since the territory gained would have been easily
attackable.

EE: Agree. You could play 'a', which is big by itself and makes O17 more  interesting. There are no really big moves left now. Black's problem is that  he is twenty points behind and has no way to catch up.]

;B[kq];W[mi];B[nj];W[il];B[im]C[EE: Just  one variation, but it shows that  White has really bad aji here. Black might pull out his stone right away,  or at least have this aji in mind for later and try to play in a way that  takes it into account. Any added black stones around here would make it  even more dangerous for White.

Since White has presence and secure points on the right side (which started  as Black's half of this parallel fuseki) this aji is Black's compensation  and it is his duty to make the most of it.]

(;B[ro]N[refutation];W[qo];B[qk]L[qn]C[EE: Pushing through at 'a' is another variation, but here I  think the immediate hane is best; White has to yield and live small in gote,  so Black can play first on the lower edge.]

;W[hq];B[nl]M[hq]C[EE: ...this  would be joseki. Even so, this joseki is not ideal for Black here: White's  marked stone is both an extension and a pincer, which should make White  happy; Black's solitary komoku stone in top right is open to a kakari and  not perfect to build a moyo from.]

(;B[pj]N[no ladder]C[EE: Since the  ladder doesn't work, Black has to retreat with something like this.]
