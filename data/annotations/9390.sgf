MM:  Hello, I am Mike Malveaux, AGA 4k, reviewing this game for GTL.  Most of my comments will be directed to Black.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj];W[nq];B[np];W[oq]C[MM:  This is more commonly at N4 (triangle).]
;B[pq]C[MM:  Looks good.];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[on]TR[nn]C[MM:  Nice and calm.  I like this better than the O6 atari (triangle).]
;W[mp];B[qn]SQ[ec][ed][fc][fd][ic][jd][mc][md][nc][nd]CR[cj]
[ck][dj][dk]TR[qo]MA[cn][co][dn][do]C[MM:  This is an important point -- actually, maybe better at R5 (triangle) -- but somehow it feels too slow, too small and local for this opening stage of the game. I'd rather see a move in the open upper side, near E17, K16, or O17 (squares).  Or else approach the open left near D10 (circles).  Probably best of all would be to approach the lower left near C5 ('x's) to prevent a 'double wing' formation.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[nl]SQ[co][do]TR[ec][ed][fc][fd][nc][nd]
C[MM:  Trying to make territory on the 6th line seems unreasonable.  I think you are mostly forcing White to become strong in the center, while leaving behind cutting points that W may later use for sente.  I think it's better to approach near E17, or strengthen near O17 (triangles).  Even better, approach the lower left corner somewhere near C5 (squares),  to disrupt White's "double wing" formation.]
;W[ml];B[ed]C[MM:  Good.];W[nk];B[ok]SQ[cc][ce][df]CR[cn][co]
[dn][do]TR[pl]C[MM:  This will give W too many forcing moves.  A quiet virtual connection at Q8 (tri.) is better.  Even better -- W did not answer your kakari at D16; so you should probably take advantage near there (sq.).  And the lower left corner, near C5 (cir.), is probably still best.  In the opening, the corner usually is a more efficient place to play than the side.]
;W[nj]C[MM:  This move seems very slow and small.];B[df]C[MM:  Excellent!]
;W[oj];B[pl];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[ri]TR[nc][nd][qf]C[MM:  Wrong side.  Black has secured the lower right; now it's time to also take the upper right, with a move near O17 or R14 (tri.).  Instead, this S11 move makes W get stronger in the upper right (see moves 38-40).]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[ro];W[rh];B[sj]C[MM:  This is the outcome of the choice Black made at move 31.  White has built a formation that will influence the upper right corner and probably the whole upper side in the fighting ahead.  White's formation has weak spots, and it will be interesting to see what happens.]
;W[qh]TR[qg]C[MM:  White protects a cutting point.  I think this would be better at R13 (tri.).]
;B[qf]SQ[se]CR[nc]TR[rd]C[MM:  This would have been good back at move 31, but now it violates the general principle 'play away from strength'.  Plus, B's corner is still undercut, so W can start an invasion with S16 (tri.) or simply reduce with T15 (sq.).  So overall, I think this really is not a good move.  It would be better to play at S16 (tri.) yourself, or near O17 (cir.).]
;W[cf];B[jd]TR[cg]C[MM:  Something in the K16-L16 area like this looks tempting -- secure the whole upper side, right?  But all the stones are high, and there's lots of room for W to invade and reduce B (see move 143).  To me, C13 (tri.) seems natural.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ef];B[dg]SQ[ff]CR[ml][mm][nj][nk][oj][pi][qh]
TR[jd]C[MM:  Wait -- I thought you wanted a big territory on the upper side.  That's what K16 (tri.) is for, right?  So maybe you should sacrifice the D14 stone -- use it with F14 (sq.) to put atari on the White, and make the upper side stronger.  Running here seems to make W stronger instead, because she gets a center-facing wall that will work well with the W stones around O10 (cir.).]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[dd]SQ[ei]TR[ed][ee]C[MM:  I do not undertand this move.  It seems way too small.  I guess it puts pressure on the two B stones (tri.), and may be kind of like sente; but continuing to crawl at E11 (sq.) , and build the wall, seems more natural.]
;B[ei]C[MM:  Good.];W[fi];B[fh]C[MM:  Good.];W[fg]
(;B[gh]C[MM:  Here, I think saving the stone is not best.  Rather, use it to make B strong in the upper side while forcing W to run with painful ugly shape (see variation).]
;W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[fj]SQ[fh][gh][hh][ih]CR[gj]
TR[ed][ee]C[MM:  At this point, this is probably correct.  The two at E15-E16 (tri.) are now looking rather weak, but it is better to lose them than to lose the four along F12-J12 (sq.).  And this move to capture is better than the loose ladder at G10 (cir.), which does not work.]
;W[ec]TR[gd]C[MM:  This looks like the natural move to exploit Black's weak group, but I think G16 (tri.) is stronger.]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[ge];W[jg];B[do]SQ[ef][eg][eh][fg][gg][hg][ig]
[jg]TR[lj][oh]C[MM:  Interesting move, and probably correct.  If I were playing, I'd probably first peep at W's cutting points on the right (tri.), to try to build strength in sente for the upcoming fight, then try to loosely surround the W stones in the upper center (squares).  But I tend to be too greedy in situations like this.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn]SQ[cf]CR[bh][cg]TR[df][dg][dh][di][ei]
[fj]C[MM:  White does not get a strong double wing after all.  This looks nice with the stones around D11 (tri.).  Unfortunately, they are undercut by the W C14 (sq.).  Black C13 and White B12 (cir.) are big gote moves for early in the endgame.]
;W[gq];B[go]SQ[do]TR[ml][mm][mp][nj][nk][nn][no]C[MM:  This looks good for Black because White's center-facing wall at the right (tri.) is becoming less effective.  I guess that D5 stone (tri.) at move 69 worked out well.]
;W[jh]C[MM:  Big move.];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk];W[kk]
;B[jm]TR[jl]C[MM:  I would crawl at K8 (tri.) instead.  Look at move 93 to see why.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[kl];B[ik];W[im];B[hm]C[MM:  Good.];W[in];B[jn]
SQ[jm]TR[hm]C[MM:  Not good.  When you played H7 (tri.), you were sacrificing the K7 stone (sq.) for sente.  How do you expect to save K7?  White will just get stronger, and those stones won't be able to connect to safety, and they don't have room to make life independently.]
;W[hn];B[gn]LB[fi:C][gm:D][hl:A][ii:B][jl:E]C[MM:  This feels dangerous for Black, because of the cutting points at H8 and J11 (A, B), and the White at F11 (C).  I would chicken out and play at G7 (D).  Moreover, this squished Black shape, and the focing moves White got, are the reason that I would have crawled to K8 (E) instead of jumping to K7, back at move 83.]
;W[io]TR[jm][jn]C[MM:  This is necessary for the safety of the White group, and it captures the Blacks at K6-K7 (tri.).  Good move.]
;B[gl]TR[gm]C[MM:  See -- you had to cover the weak spots anyway, so you might as well have played G7 (tri.) in the first place, at move 93.  (This does make strong shape though.)]
;W[jo]TR[hp]C[MM:  This seems very slow.  W should instead play at H4 (tri.) to connect the lower groups.]
;B[hp]SQ[nd]TR[gc]C[MM:  This looks like a natural spot, but let's take a minute to look at the whole board.  The white groups are too strong to kill, so the best you can do is separate them with this move, which is worth something like 20 points and gote.  I think G17 (tri.) or O16 (sq.) are bigger right now.]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[gp]TR[md][nc]C[MM:  This feels premature.  I think W should save this for a ko threat.  And, W should invade somewhere near O17 (tri.).]
;B[jp];W[ko];B[ho]TR[nc]C[MM:  The Black has successfully split the White groups, which is worth some points, but White has sente to invade near Q17 (tri.).]
;W[kp]TR[ic][md][nc]C[MM:  This small move is a White mistake.  The groups are split, and Black has done some damage.  This move can't undo the damage.  It is worth only a few endgame points.  Instead, W should play near one of the triangled points (J17, N16, O17).]
;B[jr];W[kq];B[jq]TR[ir]C[MM:  Interesting.  I would have expected the J2 bamboo joint (tri.) instead.]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[en]TR[gc][md]C[MM:  Too small.  G17 and N16 (tri.) are bigger.]
;W[dp];B[ms]SQ[pr]CR[po][qo]TR[gc][mc]C[MM:  A good idea, but too soon because big empty areas at the top are still undecided (G17, N17, tri.).  If you want to make this endgame reduction now, then I think Q2 (sq.) is better, because of the W stones at R5 (cir.) still on the board (see move 122).]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[ns];B[ls];W[kr];B[ks];W[lq];B[js];W[pr]TR[ms]
C[MM:  See?  White gets more than she deserves in the corner.  Q2 (where W just played) would have been better than N1 (tri.) back at move 113.]
;B[qp]TR[qr]C[MM:  R2 (tri.) is safe, and gives away less of the corner.]
;W[rr];B[qr];W[qs];B[qq];W[rq];B[or];W[ps];B[rp];W[nr]C[MM:  Not yet necessary.  Black gets a free move.]
;B[fs]TR[gc]C[MM:  Nice idea, but a little too far (misclick?); and G17 (tri.) is still bigger.]
;W[hs];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[gs];B[bo]TR[cg][gc]C[MM:  I think C13 and G17 (tri.) are bigger.]
;W[bp];B[bn];W[gc]TR[md]C[MM:  White gets the big sente point.  Better at N17 (tri.), I think.]
;B[hc];W[ld]C[MM:  Interesting attack.  At first I thought it was too aggressive, but White has good follow-up moves no matter how Black responds.]

(;B[nc]SQ[ed][ee][gd][ge][hc][jd]CR[kc]TR[pd][qf]C[Black has to choose between the corner (tri., Q16-R14) and the weakened group on the upper center and side (sq., G16-H17-K16 etc.).  (Trying to cap and cut at M14 seems to lead to complicated fighting.)  I personally would have played L17 (cir.) instead, because I feel like the two corner stones are more secure.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[hb];B[ib]
(;W[gb]TR[hd]C[MM:  I think W should play the H16 atari first, to ruin Black's eye shape.]
;B[id];W[fd];B[he]TR[ie]C[MM:  J15 is a shorter path to life for Black.]
;W[fe]
(;B[jf]SQ[jd]TR[lf]C[MM:  Here, I think Black should defend by attacking.  The M14 cap looks better now that Black has the strong group around K16.]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[le]
(;B[if]LB[ie:B][jf:A]C[MM:  After K14 (A), Black can live by playing at J15 (B), so this J14 stone just played is not necessary.  I think it's better to attack than defend now (var.).]
;W[kd];B[je]TR[ap][cg][rf]C[MM:  Saving this stone at this stage of the game is a mistake.  Better to play one of the marked moves (C13, S14, A4).]
;W[lf];B[qc]TR[se]C[MM:  Right idea, but prevent White's T15 monkey jump.]
;W[ne];B[of];W[nf];B[og];W[ng];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[mh];B[od]
;W[mc];B[cg]C[MM:  Good!];W[bf];B[bh]TR[bg]C[MM:  B13 is better.  (Misclick?)]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[nd];B[oc];W[mb];B[oe]SQ[ni]TR[rf]C[MM:  S14 (tri.) is better.  Also, attack before you defend; so O11 (sq.) also is better.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[sf];B[se];W[qg];B[pf];W[sh];B[si]SQ[sr]TR[or]
LB[ao:3][ap:1][aq:2][bq:4][os:8][sp:7][sq:5][ss:6]C[MM:  Better endgame sequence marked.  B A4, W A3, B A5 connect, W B3.  Then B T3 takes advantage of the dead B P2 stone still on the board (tri.).  White cannot safely play T2 (sq.), so instead W T1.  B T7 connects and threatens to capture, so W P1.  Then B can come back for the current move at T11.]
;W[ni]
(;B[bg];W[af];B[ap]C[MM:  Good!];W[aq];B[ao];W[bq];B[na];W[ma]
;B[oa];W[gf];B[hf]TR[sq]C[MM:  This is a neutral point and should be filled in last.  There are are four moves on the board that bring a better score.  The move at T3 (tri.) is sente.]
;W[ka]TR[sq]C[MM:  I'm going to play an alternate sequence for the last few moves, starting at T3, and see what the score would have been (var.).]

[mn][mo][mq][np][or][os][rg][rs][sg][sr][ss]C[MM:  White wins by 5.5.  The game was close enough that, with better endgame play from approximately move 185, Black could have won.  'General flaws' in Black's game?  1.  I think Black should more often actively seek opportunities to gain an advantage by sacrificing.  2. I think Black would benefit from study of the endgame, and 3. from 'life and death' problems in general.  Finally, 4. I think Black should make sente a higher priority.  Being stronger on any one of those four points would have been enough to win this game.

I hope this helps, and I hope you have many more happy games.  If you have questions, or if you find errors, please let me know.
