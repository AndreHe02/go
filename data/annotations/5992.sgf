C[I feel like I got caugh trading a bunch of low territory for a large center.  I don't like that, as the center is so hard to defend.  I would appreciate your ideas on how I could have countered white's high stones in the bottom left corner (he makes the shape I refer to on move 8).  Other comments are welcome as always.  I'm trying to get back into the game after a long break from it.

Thank you,
David

Neji: Hi David, I put commentaries along the game and some tips in the end. Hopefully they'll be helpful :)]

ssraika [6k\]: good luck];W[pp]C[DavidKay [7k\]: same to you]
;B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[dn];B[dj]LB[jq:A]C[Neji: This is fine, but personally I'd play at A since I don't want to let white to have san ren sei.]
;W[ho];B[nq]LB[jd:A]TR[dn][ho][dp]C[Neji: I understand this move, you wanted to steal white's big side. But there's fine move for black at A which makes double wing formation. And there's still plenty of space to invade the bottom later.

As for white's shape - no reason to counter it. Just do your things. The 3-3 in the corner is open, H3 area is open - nothing to worry about.]

[lo][mo][np][op][pp][qp]C[Neji: now white got nice thickness although to use it he should've played kakari at r14]

;B[dk]LB[ck:A]C[Neji: this looks strange to me, normal move would be at A(It blocks running direction). Don't let white live so easily.]
;W[ck]LB[gk:A][gl:B]C[Neji: A and B are shape making moves.]

(;B[fn]C[Neji: this looks too greedy. Your group at d10 is too weak.]

(;B[ie]C[Neji: You must help your weakest group first. Defend first attack later.]
;W[jd];B[ke]C[Going over the game again this move seems more risky than it did in game.

Neji: yes, many cutting points, many possiblities for mischief.]
;W[gc];B[mc];W[lc];B[cf]C[Neji: notice that your q10 group is still very weak and your opponent's group at q12 is weak as well. You can't play elsewhere if you or your opponent have weak groups.]

[hj:B][lk:C]C[I exchanged the corner for a large center territory.  Was this a poor choice?

Neji: the center is not large. It's very open from 3 directions]

(;B[cl]LB[mh:A]C[Neji: is this move that necessary? If you want to play at A play it directly with your variation (moves 57-62) you make it hard to invade lower left corner. Which you can do now. See variations -]

[rs][ss]C[Here are some general tips:

* How to decide your next move? (shygost's list) 
1. Am I ok? (am I about to get hurt or hassled?). 
2. Is the opponent ok? (can I chase or hassle the opponent to get profit?). 
3. Where is big area (going for wide area or big points).
So, if you're not ok - you do not attack or play big points. If you're ok - but your opponent isn't - you have to take your chance and attack him before he defends. And finally you play big moves only when you and your opponent are safe.

*How to attack?
To attack an enemy group is not usually to kill it, but to shut it in forcibly, or to snatch away its eye space and send it running into the center; in other words, to make the enemy defend it while you develop your own positions. So, two ways to attack:
1. destroy eye-shape. 
2. block running direction.])
