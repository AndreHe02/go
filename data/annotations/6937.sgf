C[hi reviewer, thanks for reviewing.  (281 moves)

cddc- this was a hard game for me (white)];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp]
;W[qd];B[od];W[oc];B[nc];W[pc];B[fc]LB[cf:A]C[Black could also consider playing at A here.]
;W[hc];B[jc];W[fd];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]C[I am not sure if this is a good option here,]
;B[cf];W[de];B[bg];W[bd];B[af];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[db]C[a mistake in reading]
;W[eb];B[gd];W[gc];B[nd];W[ib];B[jb];W[hd]LB[ge:A][qe:B][jp:C]
C[cddc- i think this would have been better at "A" but idk

Is this move really necessary?
B and C are very big here. Your move is gote.];B[ge]C[Black has made a heavy group]
;W[he];B[gf];W[fb];B[df];W[cn]LB[qf:A][jq:B]SQ[be][af][cf][df]
[gf][bg]C[This move feels a bit uncomfortable.
Black would be happy to play a pincernow to use his wall, or indeed just to push you into his wall.

A is an honest move, but it seems too slow now. I might think about B, splitting the side.]

(;B[cl];W[cq];B[cp]C[cddc- nice direction by "B" i think

yes, if he created a wall in the other direction he would have no extension.]
;W[dq];B[eq]C[a joseki mistake];W[er]LB[bq:A]C[the punishment is at A]
;B[bq]C[strange to play here now];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp];B[fq];W[gq]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[dr];W[fs];B[cr]C[hmm a new joseki :)]
(;W[fo]LB[eq:A]C[A might be possible also];B[en];W[do]LB[kq:A]
SQ[cq][dq]C[this doesn't seem to work while your stones are in atari. better extend.]
;B[em];W[bp];B[eq];W[bo];B[bm];W[dq];B[bn];W[ds];B[cq];W[mq]
;B[kq]C[overextension must always be punished.];W[jr];B[kr]

;B[nr];W[nq];B[oq];W[mr];B[np];W[or];B[pr];W[mp];B[no];W[mo]
;B[pm]LB[qe:A]C[also quite slow. A is very big for Black now.]
;W[nn];B[on];W[km]C[a good move];B[nm]LB[in:A]C[interesting, Black could run still]
;W[in];B[mn];W[ln];B[gn];W[ho];B[lo]C[I cannot understand this move]

C[ai ai ai ai
play at A please];B[fn];W[gp]C[more gote :'-(];B[lm];W[kn];B[ll]
;W[qi]C[should i have gone deeper?

you would come under heavy attack if you went further. Even here, I think it is too much.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[rj];B[ok];W[rl];B[qg]LB[rm:A]
C[very bad.
A is so big];W[so];B[rm];W[sm];B[ro];W[rn];B[qm];W[rp];B[qo]
;W[rr]C[Something outrageous has happened :)];B[qn];W[sn];B[qq]
;W[rq];B[ee];W[hh];B[ed];W[gj];B[ec]C[cddc- this is hard for me, i let it grow too much

I don't understand what hapened here? You didn't see the atari, or you thought it was a good exchange?]
;W[il];B[gi]LB[ej:A]C[very odd, why not just block?];W[fj];B[hi]
;W[hk];B[ej];W[fi];B[ei];W[fh];B[eh];W[ii];B[hf];W[if]LB[je:B]

You must consider what is sente and what is gote more carefully in your games. Overall you show good whole board vision, but you are overstretching a little.]
