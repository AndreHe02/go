C[DR: Hi!  I played quite seriously during this game, which took about two hours to complete, as I was recording, and there was no time limit.  I feel that my late midgame let me down badly, and I think I need some help with my opening too.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[po]LB[jd:G][dj:F][pk:A][qk:B][qo:C]
[ep:E][eq:D][jq:H][lq:I]C[DR: Is this shimari appropriate here?
The goal of this move is to extend to around H.  If W plays at H then I would be a little small.
Perhaps a more subtle approach would be to do D or E first and then hope to get H as a sente pincer followed by your move or C.  The other letter points are also excellent moves.  Each leads to a different game.]
;W[eq];B[dj]LB[cf:D][cj:B][cm:C][jq:A]C[DR: In hindsight, this seems like an over-aggressive move, and I guess it would be better just to extend from my shimari.
Nothing wrong here.  If black A and white B is that better for you?  White B is a bigger move since its a double extension so its urgent to prevent it.  You can now extend to C or D (miai)]
;W[jp];B[pk]LB[cf:D][qg:2][pi:A][qi:B][qj:C][qm:1][cn:E]C[DR: Would this move have been better at A?
I think better at B or C.  There are easy invasion points at 1, 2, and B.  D and E can also be considered]
;W[dl]C[DR: Now white has a good attack on my stone.];B[cf]
;W[fd]LB[ef:A][cl:B]C[at A is also possible.  At B for later]
;B[bd];W[cc]LB[hc:A][jc:B][lc:E][he:C][ff:D]C[A-E is a possible sequence]

(;B[kd]LB[hc:A]C[DR: Is this the correct way to respond here?
See the variation.  I like A better];W[ic]C[see variation]
(;B[kf]LB[kb:A][qf:B]C[DR: I never know what to do in this kind of situation:  I have a single stone far from support and white approaches.
See the variation for one suggestion.
White can slide at A and invade at B so you are not yet making a valuable moyo.]
;W[mq]LB[hc:B][jc:A][pc:1][ef:F][qf:G][ch:2][kj:H][mo:D][np:E]
[kq:C]C[A is big threatening B.
C is a possible invasion.  
E and D are on the line between opposing moyos so are very important for both.
G is fine but still allows a corner invasion at 1.
F is good for strengthening the 3 stones - 2 is an invasion point so they should be strengthened fairly soon.
Something around H can be considered.];B[qf]C[DR: Here I had no clue what to do.  Where are the large moves at this stage of the game?]
;W[ek]LB[ch:A]C[white must be at A]
(;B[ej]C[DR: Here I felt that I should not let white seal me in, but if I push along, he gets a nice wall facing his moyo.]
;W[fj];B[fk]LB[cl:A]C[DR: so I cut, which was probably a mistake, in hindsight.
The cut is OK as a sacrifice strategy.  See the variation after next move.]
;W[fi]LB[cl:A]C[The next move must be at A]
(;B[dk]C[This is aji keshi as white wants to play there,];W[el]
LB[eg:B][dk:1][cl:A][el:2]C[eiher A or B for black.  The cutting stone is wasted due to the 1 2 exchange.]
;B[bk]C[DR: So now my group is reasonably safe, but my cutting stone is in trouble.]
;W[ch]LB[ic:B][dg:A][dh:C]C[DR: OK, this hurts!  What should I do here?  I don't think I handled this well.
Playing at A looks to handle this.
Difficult after the move at C.  I put in several variations.  The longest one looks best.  The stone at B serves as a ladder breaker.]

(;B[ci];W[eh];B[bh];W[bi];B[dh]LB[kb:C][qc:B][qm:A]C[any thing white wants as a ko threat?  black doesnt have much ko material.  These are all good points for w]
;W[ce];B[ei]C[DR: I was nervous here.  Was I too nervous?  I didn't see any ko threats.]
;W[be]LB[fh:A]C[Think large scale.  See the variation.]
(;B[eg];W[qc]C[DR: Please point out if I could have handled the invasion better.
White lives in gote so this is good for black]

;B[qb];W[ra]LB[sf:E][fh:D][kj:B][gk:C][mo:A]C[Now A, B or C are big moves.  D is not large and is not needed to save the group.  E is sente against the corner but save it for a ko threat]

(;B[fh];W[gk];B[mo]LB[kk:A]C[DR: Another example of me not having any idea where to play.
Good or at A];W[op]
(;B[oo]C[DR: Should I have connected on the other side?
Blocking on the other side might be better.  See variation]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qq];B[qo];W[pr]
(;B[lp]LB[ro:A][or:B]C[DR: OK, maybe A would have been bigger?  But this was clearly sente.
Playing at B looks good.];W[lq]LB[jc:D][kk:C][kn:B][jo:A]C[These look like the largest moves.  They are areas where both sides can gain significant territory]
;B[cm]LB[hc:B][jc:A]C[DR: I thought this was sente, but white ignored me!

It doesnt threaten any really devasting so is not forcing.
A threatening B is stronger];W[kb]LB[lc:B][kk:A]C[DR: But this is sente too.

Is B bigger than A?];B[lc];W[bn]LB[kk:A][kn:C][jo:B]C[DR: OK, so white first played big sente, then the response.

These are now big moves to expand your moyo and reduce whites potential]
;B[jn]C[DR: This move was intended as a ladder-breaker.];W[ki]
LB[hj:A][ij:B]C[How about A or B first.  If W captures then attack the one stone on a large scale.
Going for them all is a high risk strategy when you are ahead]

it looks hopeful];W[ii]LB[ig:A]C[Definitely around A];B[mh]
C[DR: Should I be covering at the top instead?];W[qj]C[DR: I handled this invasion badly, please help!

This is a large open area with some problems so invasion is hard to kill]
