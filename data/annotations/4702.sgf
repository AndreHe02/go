C[I find that very often in my games i make mistakes in the fuseki that force me to play for center influence and territory.  It works out for me at my current strength, but i fear that i won't be able to rely on middlegame fighting as much to play catch up as i progress.

--
OK.  Remember that playing for center influence is not a mistake, it is simply one approach, and an approach taken by many strong players.  Your playing suggests that you feel greedy about your opponent making territory.

In a perfect game, neither player would ever be ahead.  The outcome of games is determined by the mistakes made by each player.  If you have strong positions, and thickness in the center, you are often in a good position to benefit from your opponent's mistakes in the chuban, when games are won and lost.
--

What i'd really like is some suggestions on improving my opening plays and choice of "joseki" (i don't really know many joseki, i just try to imitate patterns i've seen in better player's games)

--
I will review the whole game, but I do not think you were behind at the end of the fuseki.

Thanks very much in advance!

You're welcome!

;W[cc]C[By playing into the corner, you choose immediate territory over outside influence.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec]C[Im pretty sure B E17 is not joseki, but i don't know how to punish it.

Indeed this is a mistake, see the variation for one possible punishment.]

At this point, who is ahead?  I would say w is ahead, so your fuseki was not bad.]

;W[of];B[qn];W[qp]C[Not entirely sure how to respond here.

I figured if B plays O3 or a similar corner reducing move i can take p6 and have a solid side.

--
B play here is bad, to put a stone against the w wall like this.  Your solid defense of the corner is an excellent response, now b's stone looks helpless.]

(;W[ck]C[You should read more carefully in life and death situations.  The b group is *not* alive, you tenuki too soon.

Also, the status of the right side b group is undecided (meaning that if b plays first, it lives, if w, it dies) for the next 171 moves.

W can kill the group and end the game at any time for 171 moves, but you did not because you did not see it.  This means that if you improve your life and death skills you can raise your strength a lot.

Note: there is a way that b can live or escape even after T8, but even if he lives it is gote and helps w a lot.  And if he makes any mistake, he will die and the game is over.]

E6 is very attractive.  Other possibilities are D6, D7, or E7.  Tenuki is also possible.]

C[Well done, b group is dead.];B[ls];W[mr];B[gr];W[ko]C[I think H2 works here.  Im not sure why i didnt think to play it.

--
Yes H2 works, this move is a 50-point mistake.  You were far enough ahead that you can still win, but to get to dan level you need to focus strongly on not making these mistakes.  Looking at the liberties and reading every semeai is one way to get better in these situations.  Also you should slow down and take your time in the middle of fighting like this when one bad move will cost you the game.]
