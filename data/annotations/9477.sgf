AB[pd][dp]C[E: I took black in this game, and have added comments preceeded with a "E: "

Thank you in advance for the review!]PL[W];W[qo];B[ce];W[dc]
;B[pq];W[qf];B[qk]C[E: Maybe this splitting play is outrageous.  Should it be at p4?

reid: I wouldn't call it outrageous.  In fact, I think it shows good judgement and that you want to use your handicap advantage to attack as early as possible.  That's a good idea because the ratio of the numerical advantage from your handicap (four and a half stones to three) shrinks with every move.

You might want to consider playing it high (at Q9 instead of R9).  This is a bit subtle, but your intent here is not to kill either of these groups, but to make them work harder to get a base.  The third line aims toward making a base for your own group (or killing your opponent's eye potential).  The fourth line makes it easy to run to the center, and works with your existing high stones, particularly D4.

P4 is acceptable, but if you want to practice fighting (which is what your handicap stones are for), splitting is better.]
;W[np]C[E:Here comes the Taisha!!!

reid: Yes, but you have R9 in place.  The taisha relies on a balance of weakness, which R9 upsets in your favor.

White is trying to scare you :-)];B[po]C[E: I figured that with my stone at R6 I could afford to take the most severe line

reid: Good analysis.];W[pp];B[op];W[qp];B[oq];W[oo];B[pn];W[qq]
;B[nq];W[no];B[lq];W[qn];B[pm];W[nm];B[qh]C[E: This move feels a little awkward to me, but I really don't know what would be better.

reid: Turning at R7 to strengthen your weak connection (and strengthening your lower side P3 stones as a by-product) might be good too, but R12 seems fine to me.  Attacking to use your handicap stones is always good.]
;W[of];B[qe]C[E: I wanted white to be heavy

reid:  Yes, but white's natural response at R13 is sente, so I think the patient extension to O16 would be better

If O16 instead of R15, white does not dare to take the corner (R17) yet, and even sliding to S16 is not great for white, so black can be satisfied.  And white still has two weak groups to take care of while black is in no real danger..]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[nd]C[E:But now my corner is hurt..];B[nc];W[mc]
;B[oc];W[md]C[E: Maybe I've given white too good an outside for a still-fragile corner :(

reid: I wouldn't worry too much about the outside just yet.  It's difficult for white to build a moyo and take care of a weak group (O7) at the same time.

Territorially, black is maintaining his handicap lead so far.]
;B[qm]C[E:Unecessary defensive play?

reid: I think so.  I would probably play a defensive move too, but it would be S15 to strengthen the corner and prevent white R17. 

Your right-side group still has access to the center, so it's not in any real danger.  Plus the O7 group is too weak to do significant damage.

Your corner, on the other hand, is locked in.  You can bet white is going to be looking to attack.]
;W[cd]C[E: Was this a good move by white?

reid: It's a joseki, so not terrible.  However, white is behind territorialy so he needs to be stirring up trouble.  This seems a bit too easy for black.]
;B[de];W[fd];B[di]C[E: I though the simple extension would make my D4 stone happy.

reid: This seems natural enough.  But just to give you some things to think about: 

Playing low (at C11 or C10) would be more territory oriented.  With both D11 and D4 on the fourth line, it's easy for white to invade.

Another idea is to play at D6 instead of D11.  It's difficult for black to invade the side because he would then have two weak groups.  They would probably survive, but there wouldn't be much left of the top-side moyo when the dust settles.

However, black seems to be ahead at the moment, so D11 is fine.]
;W[hd]C[E:Too slow?

reid: Yes, I think so];B[ln]C[E: I try to develop the bottom left with this attack

reid: Now might be a good time to defend your corner with S15 (you might want to exchange N18, M18, O18, L17 first).

Alternatively, the other corner (C3 or C6) is big.

I would rather not press this weak group just yet, because as it stands, it is very difficult for black to invade anywhere else on the board - he would then have two weak groups, a recipe for disaster.]
;W[nk];B[ml]C[E: Good peep? Bad peep?

reid: The answer to that is: what are the other options?  In this case, you can ask whether peeping at P8 or trying to cut directly with O8 would ever be valuable.  Doesn't seem like they would be, and white's answer at O8 doesn't seem to hurt black, so N8 is OK.]
;W[nl];B[mi]C[E: I'm trying to be severe, but maybe it's slack..

reid: I wouldn't say slack, but I would say it's a bit thin.  You have too many weak links between M3 and Q12 to surround white effectively.

Again, I would prefer to leave white's weak group alone and instead grab a large point somewhere.  Inducing white to invade somewhere else would get to the "two weak groups" scenario.]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[lj]C[E: The slice here looked good];B[jj]C[E:I'm trying to stay consistent with my central influence strategy]
;W[li];B[mg]C[E: Too loose? I thought that it threatened a cut]
;W[re]C[E: White is protecting the cut that N13 was threatening..]
;B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[od];B[lh]C[E: So I get this move in, though I wonder if it was really best...]
;W[ll];B[kl]C[E: I keep taking the outside];W[lk];B[jm]C[E: Maybe this was overly defensive, since the ladder was in my favor.  I thought the thickness would keep white from easily slicing through my wall at K9

reid: This makes a nice relation to K10 while strengthening the thin spot between M6 and M3, so I think it's OK.]
;W[pk];B[pj]C[E: I wonder if R10 would have been stronger.]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[oj];B[ol]C[E: I decided that taking this eye was okay since my followup at P7 would have the potential to take the P5 stones, or squeeze them, later.

reid: But still gote.  And given black's weakness around O12 and R10, it's not likely that you'll be able to kill this group.  So would you rather have a black gote stone at P7 or a white gote stone there?]
;W[ok];B[om];W[oh];B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[pi];B[qj]
;W[mh]C[E: Well, there's a living group.  Maybe it couldn't be helped?.]
;B[kh]C[E: I wanted to complete my influence.  But maybe I should have played F4?

reid: Hmm, I would prefer a secure connection here.  It is safer and would have some effect against the white upper edge territory.]
;W[fq]C[reid: White can invade easily now that the center white group is alive.]
;B[hq]C[E: Trying to make the most of my wall

reid: But the space between H3 and the M6 stones is too close.    I think E3, F4 or even D/C6 might work better.

I'm going to end my analysis here because I think this is a psychological turning point in the game.  Black cannot expect to kill this white invasion, so he sees his moyo destroyed.

This invasion would not be nearly so clear-cut if black had not pressed on the white o5 group forcing it to live.

The lesson here is that your attacks should have a purpose, to establish a clear advantage, not just because it's possible to attack.  The weakness of an opponent's group is your asset.  Don't waste that asset too soon by forcing him to strengthen himself.

Ultimately, this game was lost because of a misread in the endgame.  Because of that and because it is a handicap game, it isn't the best type of game for analysis.  You will get more by submitting an even game where you don't understand why you lost.


Good luck, play strong
