C[krv: I'm playing black here.
Please look where I could play better.
Thank you for your time.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[qp];B[dj];W[ce]
;B[pj]C[Its unusual to give the opponent the opportunity to make two shimaris. But I would not say its wrong.]

(;B[pc]SQ[nc]C[This is bad shape. The marked white stone is on a perfekt place. Now it is difficult for black to get a good result.
The correct move would be one point to the left. See variation.]

This move is very good. White should have played there himself.]

(;B[hp]C[krv: K3 is better?

I like this for black. It is simple and clearcut. The white stone on D6 suffers.]

No. See variation.];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[er];B[fr]C[krv: White are alive and I should leave this area for ko-treats?
How to make more treats?

If you want more ko-threats, just leave it as it is.];W[dq]
;B[ep];W[gr];B[fj]LB[cg:a][hc:b]C[This move looks strange to me. How about a or b?]
;W[jm];B[lo]C[Good point. White should have played here instead of K7.]
;W[ij]C[krv: How to deal with this invasion?

This is difficult. My feeling would lead me to hane on the outside. White might live inside, but at least black gets strong so that there is no longer territory at the upper side for white. White might even die inside.

To get an idea I give some variations.]
