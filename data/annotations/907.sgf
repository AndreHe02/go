C[Black uses the high chinese opening]
(;W[jd]N[The Game];B[cf]LB[dj:A]C[A would have been splended for Black!]

(;W[fc]LB[fd:A]N[The game]C[The high move is prefered.  The low move is played when a move on that side by black is worrisome.  In this case it's not a worry, so white played conservatively without need.]

(;B[cd]LB[bd:A]C[The proper move is A]N[The game];W[cc];B[ci]
;W[qf]LB[bd:A][pj:B]C[Too slow.  The atari at A is very big as is playing ont he other side at B]
;B[qm]LB[qj:A]C[A is better, this is a slow move.  Both White and Black's corners are still open to an invasion.  The result of such an invasion will be a loss of a corner, so there better be a good result in the exchange.  Both of these extension do not yield much profit after the invasion.]
;W[df]LB[qj:A]C[A is still bigger.];B[be]LB[ce:A]C[A solid play at A would threaten to peak through white, so black would end in sente]
;W[bc]C[Instead of 14, White could have ataried 9 earlier and had a much bigger corner in sente than this.  Why protect the corner now?  You are fighting over 5-10 points when there are much bigger points to be had on the board.]
;B[qj]
(;W[ph];B[oj];W[nh]C[This is no way to fight.  White is chasing Black and allowing black to make big territory.]
;B[mj];W[ki];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[ni];B[kj];W[lh];B[lj];W[mg]
LB[ji:A]C[Where was that black stone going to go?  Better to have extended to A and try to expand white territory]
;B[ji]C[Now black loops around white];W[nj]C[A little late, black can stop this up with no trouble]
;B[kh]LB[nk:A]C[Bad move, white should force his way out and into Black moyo.  If White plays at Black, then his whole moyo stategy fallsa part]
;W[ei]LB[ep:A]C[A is the right starting point.  He can run away to here, but if White forced black to re-inforce, A will not be an option for too much longer]

(;B[dh];W[eh];B[dg];W[eg];B[de]
(;W[ef]C[Was white 14 really that important to save?  it's not critical to life or death of anything and claims no territory.]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[ee];W[ec];B[ge]C[White shouldn't feel bad. Black is trampling on territory he already trampled on with his center black group.  But those white stones are starting to look threatened.]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[jf]C[Looks like white forgot what he was trying to accomplish?
Is he trying to save the white group or defend territory?];B[gd]
C[I don't know how to comment on the fight that comes next, I will say what I can and hopefully it will help lead to the right area to study later.]
;W[gc]C[This does not help whites group in the middle at all, and the white corner is not in jeapordy.  Nor is the territory worth fighting for, when whites stones in the middle are worth more.]
;B[gg];W[hi]C[Don't know what this will do.  It does not have anyplace to run to, nor does it make eye space]
;B[ek]C[Good attack.  Makes sure White doesn't have room to make eyes.  And yet if white somehow makes life, black is taking territory as well.]
;W[dj];B[ff]LB[dk:A]C[That stone was captured already.  you didn't need to take it off the board yet.  It couldn't make an eye and so playing at A keeping white squeezed is better.  This move is as good as "Pass"]
;W[hd]LB[dk:A]C[there is no way white will capture Black here.  This is as good as a pass.  Playing at A trying to wrap around something and get eye space is better.]

;B[ii];W[hh];B[hk];W[gk];B[hj];W[gi]C[Bad move.  Saving 2 white stones when he can save 5 other white stones and get 1 sure eye, and most likely life for the entire group is worth 2 stones.

If you insist on saving every stone on the board, you will always lose.]
;B[fg];W[ie]C[This is the same as a pass.];B[mh]LB[kg:A]C[Why not just connect at A?  This capture is worth 1/2 point]
