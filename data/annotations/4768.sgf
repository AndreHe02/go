AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello! My name is Tim and I'll be reviewing your game. I go by Talaer on KGS and my email address is helxis@comcast.net

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the review.

Thanks!];W[cn]

(;W[en]LB[cq:A]C[Shouldn't the joseki be at A?

White would be foolish to play A in a handicap game like this. The result would be simply awful for him. He has to run out like he did and hope to cause more trouble later.]
;B[fp]C[Is this the best move?

Yup.];W[gn];B[ho];W[im]C[I view this move by White as a mistake. It is typically bad to run away with a knight move like this. You have strength all around, so I think it should be cut immediately.]

(;B[in]C[IS THis move bad?

I prefer the cut. This instead encourages W to get stronger. Also I think you could just tenuki here and take points. White will still have that group to worry about.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[nj];B[ml]LB[mk:A]C[Should it be at A?

This move is fine. White is trying to throw some confusion in the mix.]
;W[ok];B[nk]LB[pk:A]C[Should it be at A?

I definitely prefer A to this move.];W[qn];B[nq];W[nh]
(;B[pg]C[Is this the Best move to stop W?

W is very thin all over the place. I think you need to be a bit more aggressive.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[kh];B[jg];W[nf];B[oe];W[nc];B[oc]LB[nd:A]C[Should this move be at A?

Yes. Splitting W apart should be a priority. You would be able to use the weakness of O17 to forge a bigger attack on the W stones just below.]
;W[fc];B[dg];W[db]LB[cc:A]C[Should it be at A?

This is fine.];B[ec]
(;W[fd]C[W should have played E18. By doing this he gives you a large corner for free.]
;B[eb]C[Very good.];W[rp];B[qq];W[bp];B[cq];W[hd]LB[ie:A]C[Should it be at A?

A might be playable in this situation but I think this move provides better shape.]

[hk]C[Should I move at A?

Since N9 and L8 are miai for you, you should choose a different move. There are several very good ones on the board right now.

The marked triangle spots are good moves that would give you very good attacks.]
