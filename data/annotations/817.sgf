;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[qo]C[What  do you think of white's move here?


I think that players at this level may not know  how to deal with this  move, and the josekis that follow.

Also, it invites B to play at Q4, which works well  with his stone at  D4.

{q4= bottom right hoshi, d4 bottom left hoshi}];B[nc];W[oc]
;B[nd];W[pg]C[The  usual move is at Q14...
{one pt extension rather than 2}];B[jc]C[On extensions:   Should I have extended a shorter distance?  Also, why is the proverb "if 2 then 4" true? I'm  far better at contact fighting then making light  shape or figuring out how far to extend (and  from where.. for instance, would an extension  to the star pt be better?)

This extension could be seen as one point too far, and definately one  point too low.  But it is not serious, given the star point stone at the  top.]
;W[jp];B[cj]C[Q4 might have been good instead of this.   Now W can close off the corner.
{q4=lower right hoshi}];W[pj]C[Not a good move.  The  bottom right corner is just begging for a move to make the enclosure, at,  say, Q3...]
;B[jj]C[What do you think of this move?

Interesting...  But not attacking that bottom right corner is a  mistake.]
;W[np]C[This still leaves open the possibilty of an  attack at the star  point.]
;B[fq];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[jm]C[B now has a huge moyo on the left side.  W really needs to dive  in there somewhere.]
;W[fr];B[eq];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[hl];W[fn];B[gn];W[gm];B[hm]
;W[fm];B[in]C[Playing H4 first may have been better...

If W plays J4, B can take the 2 stones, if W plays J5, B can push  through, and possibly take them  anyway.]
;W[io];B[jn];W[hp];B[fp]C[...  and this ended up gote for  B....]

;W[dm];B[em];W[el];B[fl];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[ej];B[gj]
;W[cp]C[A shame that B did not connect these 2  stones.  W would have been in serious trouble, and may not have been able  to live.]
;B[ek];W[dl];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[bk];B[ei];W[hk]C[Not worth it.  W cannot get  out.]
;B[il];W[hj];B[hi];W[bo]C[No  need to take those stones at all.  A move such as B3 would be better, or  it would be even better to play elsewhere, attacking the top  left.]
;B[fo]C[Not needed either.];W[bq];B[ij]C[Better to descend at  D2.]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[es];B[ik]C[See, B was forced to take the  stones.]
;W[bs]C[Necessary.

B can atari at G2...];B[jf]C[Is an invasion on the right side still  possible?  What would've been a good pt?

Definately, at the bottom right star point.

But B should just work on building up the moyo.   Even a move around O 10,  for exapmle...

{o10= 3 pt extension from left little sprig, on  same line as white, 1 pt extension to}]
;W[pm];B[mj]C[Good, but why not invade the  corner?];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[ob];B[qc];W[rd]C[R16 and B would not have lived.  W should not have allowed this.   You should look carefully at the 3-3 point invasions.  They are very  important.]

C[
There was no reasonable way W could have done anything, unless he was  counting on B to make a mistake... And we do all make mistakes...]
;W[pq]C[Good move by W.  B is dead there.  Too bad for B.  He  should have invaded there long ago.]
;B[mm]C[A solid move, but you  could go further to the  right.]

 endofages 30k : okay];B[se];W[tt]C[
 endofages 30k : no, you are, you can take the 3
 endofages 30k : didn't see that];B[tt];W[rd]C[Did not need to  capture.]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[
 endofages 30k : how do we take off dead stones? I'm new to igs]
;B[tt]C[Well, W won because of the top right corner.   That is a  shame, because B played a solid game.  Do  read a book on life and death,  to avoid that kind of mistake.

Think about the bottom right corner.  It should  have been invaded early  in the game.  B would have won if it had.

The B strategy of playing with a large moyo  was well done.  This is  realtively easy when you are playing weaker  players, who do not invade, {yes!}
but will occur less as you improve.  It is a  strategy I like myself, and  I think it is good to play that way.  Keep on  playing!]
