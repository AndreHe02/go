C[Thank you for reviewing this game !

I played this on KGS with Black and won by 6,5 points.
As usual, I was nervous in the endgame so it's full of little blunders (and a large one).
Since it went good for me, I did not comment my earlier game. Looking forward
to your comments on opening moves and decisions at the turning points !

hi I'm Bastian, your reviewer for this game. I will mark my comments with Basti:
I couldn't comment much on the opening of this game because both of you chose basic joseki and made it a simple game. So although this is a little strange most of the comments are on the middlegame and especially on the engame. Early you somehow made your own light stones very heavy and urged white to attack them. You survived but in return white got a lot of thickness  he couldn't use it though and created an own terribly weak group that you managed to attack and gained a lot of territory though it seems you missed a chance to kill it. Please have a look at your variations as I have altered many of them. Sometimes when you thought you went wrong you played actually correct but went wrong later... And feel free to send any questions about this review to my email.]

I need to try it out in free games.
Basti: The move is ok. Even pros play it from time to time. The weekness in this shape is however that white could play K15 to erase any moyo.]

;W[dj];B[qn];W[np];B[io]C[Basti: In this kind of formation K10 really looks like the most promising move.]
;W[kp];B[gp]C[Basti: There's no real need to play another stone here. J5 is a forcing move with the purpose to erase a possible white moyo. It's served this purpose already so there's no need to add another stone to it. It is a general rule that stones can be abandoned after they have served their purpose. You should just leave it for now and play K10. You could even let white capture J5 later but thats no problem as white will need many stones to do so. With your next few moves you only managed to create a heavy group and gave white a lot of thickness.]

(;W[qf]C[Basti: Try to learn from white's mistake. With O16 and Q10 already in place this stone can only come under severe attack. With the black stone at O16 white's move here should be R16. If O16 would be at O17 white would play S16.]

(;B[pc]C[Basti: The right decision. The white dragon can't be attacked anymore so you can let him connect and spare the maximum of points here. I've corrected your variation so please have a look. Note please that the R15 never protects the corner so the R17 invasion works unless another stone is added to the corner.]

Basti: I can't give you much advise about this game. Your only major fault in the earlier stages of the game was treating your light stone wrong. You could also try to learn some more about the 3-3-invasion (white wasn't supposed to get those 10 points in the upper right corner).]
