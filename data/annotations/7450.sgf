AB[pd][dp][pp]C[<Hi there!

<I'd like this game reviewed because it's one of those games where I really <don't know what went wrong. I tried to play as peacefully as I could and <retain my handicap advantage, but my opponent always found some way to <squeeze the points away.

<I would also be especially interested in my general weaknessess, insofar <as you can make any deductions from one game.

Hi I´m Peter and I am a German 3 Kyu. I hope I can give some tips to improve your Go.]

[nd][nf]C[<I have a feeling that I should have been able to kill the developing White <group at this stage, but unfortunately it doesn't work out. Would I perhaps <have had better moves available?

If you want to kill a group, you first have to encircle this group. So play A at B. But this is also risk for the black corner group.
It isn´t nessecary to kill this group. To chase it while making territory at the lower edge is good enough.
Besides you can hope to start a pretty splitting attack, if you are able to chase the white group in the direction of the two triangle stones.
The three white rectangle stones are also weak. If white try to escape in this direction, you can hope for a splitting attack too.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[nj];W[pk]C[Try to live with W55 and W57 is bad. White should escape.]

[od:7][qd:2][kf:A][hj:B]SQ[nc][nd][nf]C[W79 is a pure move of defense. Don´t answer!

Let´s have a look at the whole board:
Black have a lot of saved territory:
- upper left corner: about 20 points,
- upper right edge (if white get the endgame 1-8): about 25 points,
-lower right corner: about 20 points,
- lower left corner: about 7 points,
summary 72 points.
White has:
- in the lower right: 5 points,
- at the lower edge max. 10 points.
So he needs min. 55 points at the left edge, to have prospects of winning.
On top of everything the three white rectangle stones are weak.
So I propose: first attack the  rectangle stones by playing A (see variation). After that to can reduce white´s framework slightly by playing at B.
After B white cannot hope to earn more than 40 points on the left. Because of the wall it should be easy to connect Black B.]

(;B[jr];W[jq];B[kq]LB[kr:A]C[Locally better at A.];W[ir]C[Don´t answer. That´s endgame.]
;B[ks];W[qi];B[qh]C[Very good.];W[jj];B[lj]C[You need not to connect two living groups. Don´t answer. Attack the upper white stones or reduce white´s moyo.]
;W[kh];B[cr];W[er]
(;B[im]C[Too timid. It helps white to wall up his framework (Look at variation).]
;W[hl];B[lc];W[ke];B[fo]C[B96, 100, 102 and 104 are dame points. They only connect already living groups.]

;W[ik];B[jm]LB[ob:A][lc:D][cm:B][cr:C][jr:E]C[Dame point. Play A!

After 45 moves we should again have a look at the whole board:
By playing B an C you earn 4 points, by playing D around 6 points and by playing the stones around E 4 points, while white earn over 50 points.
How was it possible, that white got territory directly in front of the black wall?
What do you earn for your wall? Do you know, what I want to say?]

(;B[me]LB[re:A]C[<I was really happy with finding this move, but did I handle the ensuing fight in <a bad way, or should i just have been more peaceful?

Yes, it looks like a nice tesuji, but that can´t be helped - it doesn´t work. The black corner group hasn´t enough liberties. So now I propose to play A (see variation or comment B132, it´s difficult to say, what is better).]

You was very strong in the beginning and after 78 moves you got a very strong position. You lost this game, because you wasn´t  able to use your wall to attack the upper white group and to reduce white´s moyo.
The moves 79 up to 126 mostly help white.
I´m sure, if you were able to keep your advantage until move 126, the losing sequence 127 up to 149 never was played. But so you was forced to play more aggressively and the miscalculation was happens.
