C[Dear Reviewer, in this game I had b and tried to play the sanren-sei fuseki. In the end I was not able to handle my moyo properly. So this game from may point of view was mainly about "How to build a moyo, defend it  against invasion and turn it into real territory". Besides there was, as you will see, a problem with an invasion from b into w's sphere of influence / territory where I had to struggle with when and how to invade and how to deal with it in the further game. Thank you very much for your help! Henning

\\m/ : Hi, I am around 1-3k on KGS so take what I'll say with a grain of salt. The main problem in this game is the passivity of black. Where w launch overly agressive moves and should be punished for that, b feels weak and overprotects his stones. The w overplay ends in a huge success because of that. To gain some stones, you have to learn to recognize strong and weak positions. If you have money to spend on books, I recommend "Direction of play" by Takeo Kajiwara and "Attack and Defense" by James Davis and Ishida Akira.

;B[dd];W[cp]
(;B[jd]C[\\m/ : yes, you have your san ren sei but ask yourself about direction of stones. k16 helps to develop both q16 and d16. That's good, that's the aim of san ren sei.]
;W[eq]C[\\m/ : wrong shimari, the one at q5 is better]
(;B[dj]C[\\m/ : see move 5, even more important now with your san ren sei]
;W[pj]C[\\m/ : This move does not protect the kakari at q5 and not attack q16. Better to chose one of this possibility instead of a move that try to do the both half-way...]
(;B[jj];W[ip]
(;B[cm];W[dn];B[dm];W[em]C[What to do next? I decided to go for an extension along the right side. It was maybe the wrong choice at this moment. A Kakari placed down in the lower right corner might have been the better choice.

\\m/ : if you're confident in your fighting skill, you can cut here at e6 for local problem. If tenuki, kakari at LR is good as shown before or as corrected in your variation.]

C[17 stones to gain three points and end in gote - not so efficient from b I assume.

\\m/ : a lot more than 3 points, w has cutting points everywhere and m4 still open. And it's an invason in w sphere of influence, so living is the aim... You could have a better result but this is not a failure]
