C[kklim: I will make comment in [kklim> \] manner, and add chinese key terms when fit.

Thank you.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[qm];W[mq]
(;B[qo]C[kklim> this move i do not feel it is right. White response play at R4 will help white secure the right bottom corner. Normally in the opening stage, do not make the move settled the shape. If want, take R3 (san-san), as white next move obviously will be R5 or R4 to secure the corner "land".]
;W[qp];B[qk]LB[qj:A][pj:B][ep:C][eq:D][cj:E]C[kklim> I think for black can consider those point as well. Black just extend 1 space is no efficient. Atleast should extend to A or B.]
;W[cm]LB[eq:A][ep:B][oc:C][od:D]C[kklim> this move for me is no good. For me, A, B, C, D position look fine.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[sp];W[sq]C[kklim> black S4 and T4 is bad move. Help white to secure the corner.]
;B[sn]C[kklim> bad move.]
(;W[qq];B[po];W[oo]C[I felt pretty good about the game at this point.  I was happy with the development of the lower-right corner, and I had plans for the lower half of the board.

kklim> even black have few black move, I think black still can play.]

(;B[on];W[pn]C[I have no idea what I was thinking when I made this move, but I catch myself making this kind of mistake a lot.

kklim> along the time you will learn from this obvious mistake.
Be easy, this game is no about no make mistake, it is about who make the less mistake won the game. :-)]
;B[pm]
(;W[di]TR[pn]LB[cf:A]C[Obviously Q6 is toast, so I thought I should move up the left of the board.  Looking at it now, I think I should have extended along the bottom.

kklim> you are right, but I propose location serve you better?]
;B[dg];W[jp]LB[ko:A][lo:B]C[Was this move to shallow?  I wonder if I would have done better to play at a or b.

kklim> B or N5 for me is fine move.];B[nn];W[no];B[jd];W[gp]
C[Again, I wonder if I should have been playing along the 5th line.

kklim> your idea for play at 5th line is workable, as move4 and move24 is at 4th line, move28 stay at 5th line is more 3D for your shape.]
;B[qg];W[fn]LB[mn:A][od:B][fh:C]C[kklim> this is no a good move, should play near your move22 to support or invade near blackl area or hane black25.]
;B[ei]
(;W[ek]C[This is the part of the game where I tend to get insecure, and my opponents don't seem to have any trouble capitalizing on this.  I don't think E9 was the right move, but I'm not sure why.

kklim> white32 should attach black31 if you want, or extend your white22.]
;B[dj];W[ej];B[ci];W[cj]C[These are some panicked moves here.]
;B[dh];W[dk]C[Should I have started to build a wall along the 9th line earlier?]
;B[di];W[bk];B[bj];W[ck];B[bh];W[mn];B[mm];W[mo]MA[sp][rp][qo]
[po][on][nn][mm][ei][dj][ci][bj]CR[lm][fj][gj][km][kl]C[I placed N5 to connect, but I wonder if I would have been better off to play M6?

kklim> if you want to choose between N5 and M6, M6 move is better.

For me, in this moment of time, black selected stone already forming a very strong influence, if black take those circle point, the game is really difficult to play for white.]
;B[ln]C[Yep, should have played at M6.];W[jn];B[km];W[kn];B[lo]
;W[lp]C[kklim> i hope at this point you know the situation, black won simply by the moyo relative large that you. :-)]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[kp];W[kq]C[I can see now where black get's the payoff for my mistakes several moves ago.]
;B[lm];W[iq]C[I didn' t want to see black try to move in at K3, so here I placed at J3.]
;B[jm]C[I see now that K7 may have been a better move than J3.]
;W[im];B[il];W[hm];B[mh];W[cc]C[I stronger player at a recent local AGA meeting tryed to teach me how to play behind the star point at san-san.  I thought I'd give it a try.  At this point in the game, I'm starting to notice that I handed the top two-thirds of the boart to black, and I'm getting nervous.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[bc]C[kklim> black this move is bad.];W[bd]C[I pointed out a similar mistake earlier.  Looking at it now, I think B16 is a horrible move.

kklim> you are right, this move make the black bad move become right move.]
;B[be];W[bb];B[ad];W[ab];B[ec];W[cb];B[eb];W[da];B[ea]C[So, the upper-left corner went pretty badly.  I suppose a little time with san-san joseki is in order?]
;W[gk]C[Here, I'm trying to plug the gaping hole in my would-be territory.

kklim> losing too much, should resign early. Once you advancing your skill, you will know resign in the right time is actually crucial skill.]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[hk];B[ik];W[hl];B[hj]C[kklim> Black85 move is actually game over already.]
;W[ij]C[There's that mistake again at J10.  Perhaps some time with a psychologist can cure me of this move?]
;B[ii];W[jj];B[kj];W[jl]TR[ij][jj]C[I think I placed the stone at K8 to save the marked stones above it.]
;B[kl]TR[ik][il]C[I think black let me have these stones at J8 & J9.]
;W[jk];B[ji];W[fk];B[aj];W[ak];B[kk];W[pd]C[Here, I was feeling very hedged in, so I attacked the upper-right corner.

kklim> even your san-san invade for the 2 corner is success and able to small live in both corner, you still losing a lot of point.]
;B[pc];W[oc]C[I remember feeling a bit confused here.  I didn't know where to try to steer black - I had no stones to strive to connect to.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[mc];W[qc];B[pb];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg]
;B[ph];W[oe];B[re]C[I just let black push me around in the upper-right corner.]
;W[of];B[me];W[kb]C[L18 was meant to help me extend along the top side.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[kd];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[nd];W[oi];B[oh];W[gi]
C[Perhaps if I could tear thru my own wall at G11 & H11, I can make headway thru the center?]
;B[hi]C[Nope.];W[gh];B[gg];W[ff]C[Panicked attempt at extension.  Maybe H12 would have been a better move?]
;B[fg];W[fe];B[fd];W[nm]C[Another attempt to tear past the wall I helped black build.  Why I thought it would work this time is anybody's guess.  It's at this point in the game that I wondered if I should resign, but I wanted to see the game played out.]
;B[om];W[nl];B[nk];W[ol];B[pk];W[nj]LB[oj:B][ok:A]C[Here, P9 (a) seemed like it would be a bad move, since black could cap it at P10 (b), so I thought I'd reach out at O10.  I should still be able to connect around the left if black blocks at a.]
;B[ok];W[mk];B[ml]TR[nk]C[So, connecting around the left of O9 didn't work out at all.  How would I have been better prepared for this?]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi];W[li];B[lh];W[ki];B[pl];W[nl]C[I'd hoped to keep black from getting life for his group by playing at O8.]
;B[kh]TR[jm][ki][kj][kk][kl][km][ko][kp][li][lj][lk][lm][ln]
[lo][mk][ml][mm]C[Looking at the marked groups, I thought I might have a chance and killing black's 12 stones if I didn't blow it and lose 5 of my own.  Of course this can't work because of my group's single liberty at M8, and black's opportunity for connection at O7.]
;W[nh]C[I probably should have played O11 here instead of O12.]
;B[ni];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[ne];W[lf];B[mg]C[Looking at the game now, I see one of my biggest problems being a failure to connect.  I'm leaving trails of dead stones all over the board.  Perhaps some stones placed in the upper part of the board before settile into the bottom could have helped prevent this?]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[hf];B[hg];W[he]C[Why don't I make a bamboo joint to connect my dead stones?]
;B[gf];W[if];B[ie];W[hd];B[ge];W[hc];B[hb];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib]
;B[gb];W[ia];B[jg];W[ja];B[nb];W[ke];B[le]C[I'm hoping to make shape in the middle of the top edge by fighting.]
;W[ka]LB[je:A][ld:B]C[I see here black has opportunities to connect at K15 & M16.  For some reason, I play neither.]
;B[je];W[na];B[ob]C[I board is getting to complicated, and I'm losing track of my stones.  Two more are lost near the upper-right corner.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ha];B[ga];W[fb];B[gc];W[ee];B[de];W[df];B[ed]
C[I've been throwing stones at the board for several moves now.  For some reason, I cannot find a place to concentrate.  I think resignation is long over due - but again, I want to see the game played out.]
;W[ld]C[I thought I was throwing in at M16, but the black group to the left isn't surrounded.  Ooops.

kklim> when black moyo is being "acutalize become really territory", it is too late to invade. What to survival in enemy territory is possible only if you confidence you are stronger that opponent a lot. Even black make few mistake, since you can't capitalize that, and make some of the black bad move become good move. Hope you notice it.

Once you start your study on fundamental on fuseki (opening), joseki, tesuji, yose ...etc, then you will start to forming the shape pattern- The actual weiqi language. Then you will start to got a good feeling on the move according to the full board position.]
