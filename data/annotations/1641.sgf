C[Yes, I know. I (white) have won this game. But only whith a small margin (2.5 points) and with the chance of a mistake of my opponent in the yose.]
PL[B];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[dj]C[W: I always need to recover my handicap stones to feel good.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[A pincer is good here.];B[dr]C[Black should just enter at C3.]

(;W[cq]C[White could play E3 (see variation)];B[fo];W[en]C[D6 instead of E6 is sufficient, to leave fewer weaknesses on the left side. W will suffer from the weakness for a long time.]
;B[cr]C[Black C2 is too low at this point of the game.]
(;W[nc]C[W: Is it right ?

It is a big point, but playing in bottom left is more urgent. Play the urgent point before the big point. (See variation).]
;B[kd]
(;W[ic]C[J17 is not good, since the W corner is still open at C17. W should just enter at R17 (see variation).]
;B[nd]C[This is good for black, it works well with Q9.];W[md]
;B[ne];W[me];B[mc];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb]
(;B[mf]C[Black could also capture at O18 (see variation)];W[lf]
;B[lg];W[kf]C[Now J17 doesn't look good. W is overconcentrated and still has to worry about B O18 and later B M16. W will suffer for a long time from the weakness at M16. This confirms that J17 was a bad move.]
;B[mg];W[kg]C[W: I have prefered the center ...

Yes but B also constructs a nice moyo on the right and W still has the corner open at C17. And you let black play O18 which would be very bad for W (see variation at next move).]

(;B[oc]C[W: ... and I lost the possibility of the corner. Can we speak about L13 and P17 as miai ?

Black should play O18 instead of P17. The difference is very big. Black O18 makes profit in sente (see variation).]

(;W[nb]C[W: I think that this move will be left for later. Instead M11 ? Or near N3 ?

The problem is that Black O18 is sente because of the weakness at M16. So you have to pay now for earlier mistakes and capture anyway.]
;B[ob];W[ma]C[Now W is really overcentrated, and J17 is a wasted move.]
;B[kq]C[W: "Of course !". I have said.
But I was not afraid and I was thinking that the game was rather well balanced.

I think that B is better. Remember that the top left corner is stil open and that W has weaknesses on the bottom left.]
;W[ho];B[fn];W[hm]
(;B[bq]C[B is too kind. W has many weaknesses (see variations).]
;W[bp];B[dq]C[B should not atari. This helps W and does little for B, so W is very grateful for the exchange D3-C4.]
;W[cp];B[ep]
(;W[eo]C[W: I have think about E7 but I chose this one to indirectly protect my tobi (H4) because it allow me G4.

W E7 is not really safe (see variation). You don't have to worry about black H4. W can easily sacrifice H3 in exchange for thickness outside.]
;B[qo];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko]C[W L5 is an overplay (see variations at next move).]

(;B[lq]C[Black is too kind, should cut at M5 (see variation).]
;W[lo]C[W is happy but should not have obtained such a result.]
;B[mq]C[Black plays solidly but should be more agressive.];W[mm]
C[ W should fix the weakness at E7 first. E7 is almost sente otherwise B could be in danger.]
;B[cc]C[W: I have not been surprised. Instead, I was waiting for. Because I have already planed something around P13 like in move #64.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[bc]C[W: Here, again and again, I ask myself if I must play B17 or F16 first

The standard move is E17, not F16. But B17 can be played here because of the W strength on the right.]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[ec];W[fd]
(;B[fc]C[B E16 leads to interesting variations :)];W[gd];B[ab]

(;W[og]C[W: The sequence, beginning with this move, goes really like I have planed. Reviewing it, I think my opponent was too gentle with me.

W P13 is a complete overplay. If you want to sacrifice P13, get a least something in exchange. B could simply answer at O10 and you have gained nothing in the P13/O10 exchange. If an invasion (P13) doesn't work, you can simply erase the opponent's moyo and increase yours. The variation starting with W O10 is much better for W than the actual game. Protecting the weakness at E7 would also be very big.]

(;B[ph]C[B is too kind (see variation).];W[ni];B[mi];W[li]C[If W wanted to play M11, it would have been better to play there directly without wasting P13 first.]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[ll]C[W: So, I have my big moyo ! If I have counted, I should have realize that it was not enought

But you gave B a huge territory also! Your moyo is still open because of the weakness at E7.]
;B[nm]
(;W[mn]C[W: This the game's play. I have worked hard on it. I was tempted by the variation beginning with O6, trying to exploit O8, N12 and O14 defects.  Finally, I think I would have.

But you assume too much about the black answers. B wouldn't play as you expected.]
;B[nn];W[gp];B[fp];W[fl]C[W: Since few moves, and for a few ones, I was only afraid by the defects of my own moyo !!!

You are right, but you should have protected earlier.];B[br]
;W[em]C[W: Afraid by a combination of black E7, D5 and/or B5.

Right, E7 is essential after black played B2.];B[ed];W[ee];B[de]

Yes L2 is bigger.];W[gr];B[fr];W[ms]
(;B[kr]C[The correct answer is at O1 or N2. (see variations).]
;W[ks];B[ls];W[lr];B[or]C[W: Why ? He must do: B N2, W M1, B O1, W K1, B P2. Thanks for these 2 points.

(;W[kb]C[W: Maybe useless, but I have 3 points.

It was not useless because of the aji of D15 (see variations).]
;B[ns];W[mr]C[W: My opponent spend a lot of time to end this game. I think he was looking for my 5 nearly cuted stones in the upper left. But, he does not try anything.

Yes, after W L18, white is safe.

In this game, the worst white move is P13. If you remember that erasing a moyo can be more profitable than invading it, this review will have had some use :-)]
