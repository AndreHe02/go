C[I am happy to review this game (both sides) for the Go Teaching Ladder.

As you play through it you will notice I have often suggested different moves in certain situations, along with variations that demonstrate why such moves are probably better and how they might have played out; some of these would change the outcome in Black's favor.  Please do not regard them literally, as go is a complex game with far too many possibilities to analyze, but as illustrations.

OK -- let's begin!];B[dd];W[qp];B[cq]LB[cp:C][dp:A][dq:B]C[While this move is playable, it strikes me as unusual for mid-kyu (or weaker) players, especially since White played on a 3-4 point rather than 4-4.   If I were Black I would have played at A but B and C would also be OK.

Once Black secures this corner it will be smaller because it started with this move.]

[cn][ao][bo][co][ap][bp][cp]C[I am not an expert at fuseki but don't like this move.    It stakes out a potential territory along the left side but that territory is very low (meaning close to the edge).   It is also
a gote move, meaning that White does not have to respond.   

If I were playing here I would play at A, after which several predictable moves would follow, leaving Black in a better position (see variation).]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fb];B[eb];W[jc]LB[op:B][id:A]C[This is acceptable (and could also be played at A), but I might consider playing at or near B to protect White's corner and prevent Black's expansion along the bottom.]
;B[oq]LB[pm:A][pn:B][op:A]C[I like this move, and A would also be playable.  Notice it is sente (= initiative), meaning White must respond.

In my opinion White should have played here on his previous move (proverb: "Opponent's move is usually my best move.")]
(;W[pm]LB[qn:B][pn:A]C[I would prefer this move at A because it prevents Black from invading at B, which is a threat.   But then Black will extend along the bottom (variation), which White may not like.]
(;B[qr]LB[qq:A]C[Sorry, Black, but this is a pointless move.  It does not threaten White in any way and it is so low (close to the edge) that it doesn't stake out any territory.

Even if playing one line higher (at A) doesn't help; see variation.]
;W[pr];B[pq];W[qq];B[or];W[rr];B[ps];W[jq]LB[dh:B][fj:A]
(;B[fj]LB[no:C][oo:D][lq:A][lr:B]MA[oq][pq][or][qr][ps]C[Black has a good instinct here: it's wise to push into the center -- though perhaps not yet.  See variation.

Also, remember that Black's marked stones aren't quite alive yet and will need support by playing at or near A.   I think these stones are safe enough for the moment, but if White is able to play at or near A Black will have to play at B to make eyespace and/or extend to C or D.

Assuming Black eventually manages to live here, his territory will be small.  This does not balance well with the lower left corner where, because of his opening move, he will also have to live small.]
(;W[cn]LB[nd:A][en:B][bp:A]C[This is looks like a nice aggressive move for White but is probably not as good as reinforcing somewhere around A.

If White wants to play here, B is probably better as it forces Black to live low and small along the lower left side (variation).]
(;B[bp]LB[nc:B][dg:A][en:C][fq:D]C[Black's move does not place him in immediate danger but makes a small corner even smaller.  

I think Black has three better choices here.  A is probably best because it solidifies and expands the upper left corner; it also supports the F10 stone where Black previously extended.  B is a feistier approach that aims at splitting White's top and right side groups.  Another possibility is C, which aims at walling in White's invading C6 stone but is probably insufficient (variation).

If Black's focus is on preserving/enlarging the corner, D would be better than the move played.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[ck];B[bj];W[bk];B[ak];W[be]LB[pj:D][nd:C][cf:A]
[en:B]C[Invading is a good idea, but not here (A is better) and not yet. What White really needs to do now is put a stone at B to protect his group.

C and D are other points where White is vulnerable, but these are less urgent.]
;B[bd];W[ce];B[cd];W[bh]LB[dh:A]C[This doesn't accomplish anything: if Black plays next at A, White is dead.]
(;B[fh]LB[dh:A]C[Black lets White off the hook.  See variation for Black lethal play at A.]
;W[ef];B[dh]C[This is no longer a lethal threat because of White's stone at E14 (White can escape).]
;W[de];B[ed];W[eh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ei];W[ff];B[hr];W[ir];B[ij]
LB[lr:A][mr:B][hq:C]C[This may look IMPORTANT but it is not yet URGENT; there is a difference. Black must address two concerns on the bottom.  First is A or B to make eyespace for the corner group and second is C to stop White from pushing left into the corner.]
;W[mr]
(;B[hp]LB[nc:C][nd:B][ek:E][qk:D][oo:A]MA[bk][ck][dk][cn]C[White's N2 move takes away Black's eyespace in the lower right and obliges him to 
defend by playing A, for example.  Instead Black plays the extension at 49, which both protects his H2 stone and indirectly threatens White's marked stones.    I don't think the H2 stone is important enough to worry about, so long as Black's corner is safe.  Black
had stronger moves, including not only A but also the invasions at B or C and, especially, D, which I think is very powerful (see variation).]
;W[al];B[aj];W[bm]C[White responds reasonably and protects his stones for now.]
;B[dp]LB[qk:D][do:A][eo:B]C[A or B would also work and make more territory.  Maybe now is a good time for Black to think about D.]
;W[fl];B[fn];W[hl];B[ih];W[fk]LB[mp:B][nd:A]C[I don't understand this move at all.  Personally I would play A if White, or perhaps B first and then A after Black replies.]

;W[nc]LB[is:A]
(;B[is]LB[nd:A][qc:B]C[Having played P18, Black should now continue at B and make some territory in this corner (variation).  After looking at this variation, go back and see how different things would be if Black invaded at A instead.]
;W[js];B[pc]LB[qc:A]C[Has to be at A; otherwise White kills.]
;W[qc];B[fd]C[Good move!];W[qb]LB[gd:B][qd:A]
(;B[qd]LB[gd:A]MA[ob][pc]C[What is Black trying to do?  He cannot save the marked stones. But he can reduce White's territory by extending at A (variation). This potential is what made his previous move so good.  An extension at A will have three liberties and be hard to stop.]
;W[oc];B[re]LB[qe:A]MA[qd]C[Black probably can't save this stone, so any move to save it are essentially wasted.  However, if an attempt is to be made, it MUST be with a solid connection such as A.]

;W[gh];B[ek]LB[kc:A]C[This is merely extending from a dead group and therefore accomplishes nothing.  What Black should do is play at A now and save 97 for a ko threat if the opportunity arises; it would be good for that.]

;W[er];B[ne]LB[og:B][ka:2][kb:2][le:1][me:1][md:A]C[A is better from the standpoint of making eyespace.  It is already late for Black to start think about this.  His group looks open but in fact has limited eye potential.  

By playing at A Black can ensure one eye of one or two spaces at 1.

With luck, he may be able to make another eye of one or two spaces at 2.

As soon as White plays at B, Black has no hope for making eyes in this area and can be easily blocked if he tries to run away.]

LB[ld:B][md:A]C[Black has a false sense of security, and should really be concerned with making eyes.  With one move at A, White can seriously threaten his inside eye potential.  If Black plays there (or at B) he makes at least one eye.]
;W[jb]LB[pg:A]C[This prevents Black from making an eye along the top.  Now it is more important than ever for Black to extend around A.]

[qr][ps]C[This connection isn't necessary.  If White plays here, Black can play at A (miai).  In order to have ANY chance Black must play at B to make one eye and find some way to make another, although he can't succeed unless White blunders.

No further comment, as Black is already hopelessly behind (by 150+ points) with only one solid group (upper left corner).  Three groups are dead.  White, by contrast, has no dead groups. Black's large group in the center and lower left, though living, can be so greatly reduced by White's incursions that its actual territory will be quite small.

Several of my comments, if heeded, would have helped Black make life, threaten White and/or make a foothold in new territories.

Generally White outplayed Black in this game, but what really defeated Black was his own mistakes.  Here is a little checklist I like to use when evaluating a position and weighing different move options:

>Safe = two eyes, OR ample eye space, OR assured escape/connect,
OR assured surround and capture opponent's stones

>Me safe?

>You safe?

>What now?

>Always value sente ; avoid gote when you can

>Game flow = corners, sides, middle

>3 line is territory, 4 line is influence

>Avoid first line, except for life and endgame

>Capture only when necessary

>Count liberties

>Multiple territories need more stones, and give less points

>Avoid double, triple, or more hane

>Take risks, but don't be stupid about it

>Make territory while fighting

>Complicate when behind];W[cr];B[ma];W[na];B[br];W[cs];B[bs]
