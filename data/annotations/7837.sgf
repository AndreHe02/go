C[Hi, and thanks for reviewing this game. I have never sent a game for review, nor had one reviewed before, so please forgive me for any silly questions.

I was playing black and my opponent was 10k. Played on KGS, Although I appeared as 10k? I would say I am around 13k.


D: Hello, I'm Felix a.k.a. Djif-Master (djifmaster) on KGS.
I hope my comments and variations are helpful. Maybe not everything is understandable right away, but at least you should get the general ideas behind my suggestions.
Feel free to contact me, if there are questions left.
I would also appreciate your feedback to this review. That would be important to me to improve my future reviews.

My main advice to improve your game is, to take sente and just play the big points you want to play. I had the impression, that you followed the moves of your opponent to often.

I'll preface all my comments with 'D:'.

Have fun!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qo]LB[pk:6][qk:3]
[pl:5][ql:2][pm:4][qm:1][np:A][op:C][mq:B]TR[oc][qd]C[Ok, usually I would go for a shimari at A or B, but I thought I might try a pincer. Not to sure about how to proceed with it, so I thought I would stay far from R6.
I thought the pincer to be a good idea since I already had a shimari on the upper right.

D: Your thinking is very nice. A pincer which is also an extension from the top is very good. Possible pincers range from 1 to 6. It is difficult to distinguish which one is better, even at my level. I think you can get a fair result with all of them. Playing at R6 is bad, because it strengthens the white stone.
A and C are also good. B is not good in this situation.]
(;B[ql];W[qm]LB[qq:A]C[My plan for this corner... make him work to get some space.

D: This move is clearly bad for White. Better play at A.];B[pl]
C[D: Very good.];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]LB[oo:B][jq:A][mq:C][nq:D]
[or:E]TR[pq][qr]SQ[om][pp]C[Looks like time to play a big point. Maybe A better? Or continue the fight on the lower left, with B or the squares? (not really fond of this as there are so many big points left).

D: It is absolutely no time for Black to play a big point! The marked stones are very weak. If you don't add another move. White can attack severly at C and get a nice position.]
(;B[cj]LB[mq:A]TR[pq][qr]C[D: Black missed to reinforce the marked stones. White should immediatly play at A.]
(;W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[nl];W[rl];B[rk];W[sl];B[qj]LB[mq:A]C[D: White can still attack at A!]
(;W[rn]LB[jq:A][mq:B]C[I think I should have left the fight, now and go for A, now. (a) seems too slow.

D: I think you allready know. Black should play at B.];B[oq]
LB[mq:A]C[D: Slow, A gives more eyespace.];W[rr];B[pr]LB[ps:A]
C[D: Better to play at A. Creates more eyespace.];W[nm];B[ol]

(;W[mc]LB[jc:B][kc:A][qg:A]TR[oc][qd][qj][ll][nl][ol][pl][ql]
C[Maybe a pincer at A or B would have been better? If he tried to invade I should be able to keep his upper and right side groups cut.

D: You should definitely play a pincer. Your corner shimari is strong, your wall is strong. So what does White want there? Play tight, if you are strong around. So A seems best.]
(;B[qg]LB[kc:A]C[D: Bad move. Use your thickness to attack, not to make territory. Pincer on the top at A as shown in the other variation is best.]
;W[ne];B[ng];W[of];B[og];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[ph];W[qh];B[pi]
;W[nf]LB[kc:B][mg:A]C[D: Here is for example the time to play one of the big points you talk about. You won't make big territory in the center (as I show later), so no need to continue at A. And the only good way to attack White here is probably by playing at B.]
(;B[mg];W[mf];B[kg];W[lf]LB[gc:A][lg:B][lq:C]C[Aiming for some territory in the center... Now that I think of it so many big points left, but the time seems never to come to play on those.

D: There is not much territory in the center. Considering how many stones you played there, you played very inefficent. If White gets something around A, the top is much bigger. White has also B to reduce.
I know what you mean by "the time seems never to come to play" the big points. But there allways is the time. Just play where you want. The only exception is, that you have to play an urgent move, to live or to have a safe group; like playing at C.]
;B[cm]LB[lg:A][cn:B]C[D: White can play at A to reduce the center. So move 43, 45 are not so important.

I think your extension should have been at B, because it threatens a jump into the corner. Therefor White will answer there.]
(;W[ch];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[cr];B[do];W[eo];B[dn]C[This development seems very disfavourable to me. Looks like white is going to get the lower side (he did) and there is not much I can do about it... such a waste, I think my center influence could have helped me if I had exchanged the corner for influence...

D: In such a situation you should allways evaluate the hole situation carefully. Please go to move 58.]

[bo][co]C[D: After the exchange in the lower left corner it is your turn. So you can decide, where to play next.
If you feel behind it is a good behaviour to count first. Than it is easier to decide, how you have to proceed. Is an invasion neccessary or is a light reduction enough? Where is the biggest potential for further developement? And so on.

So let's count first: You should only count territory which is definetly solid. Therefor I marked Black's territory with squares, White's territory with triangles:
Black: left side + center + top right = 11 + 11 + 27 = 49 points
White: bottom left + bottom right + komi = 9 + 10 + 6,5 = 25,5 points

In solid territory you have quite a comfortable lead, but what we have also to take in account is the potential developement and potential territory of both players!

I marked the interesting areas from A to D.
Black's only hope to develope is in the C and D area.
White has big potential in the A and B area and some potential in the D area.

So what to do? See next move for start.];B[lq]LB[cc:A][ic:B]
[kj:C][fq:F][jq:D][ps:E]TR[pr]C[D: This is an excellent move. I waited allmost 40 moves for someone to play there. ;-)
But now you maybe see the arkward shape of your group. The marked stone should be at E. If you study you next moves in this area carefully you will see, how often you had to play there to secure life of this group, just because of the bad shape.

But back to the main topic, how to proceed after move 58.
Playing M3 is so important because it secures your group and plus D area is a shared point for both players. If White does not answer Black at F threatens the hole white group in the bottom left corner.]
;W[jq]LB[cc:A][ic:B][kj:C][jq:D]C[D: As expected White answered on the bottom. Now Black has to find a way to take sente. Black cannot ignore White's move, because then White could attack Black's group severly. See variation.]
(;B[kn]LB[ca:D][lo:A][kp:B]TR[lq]C[D: Large knight's move is easy to cut. That's why you should play solid shapes, so you don't invade your opponent to attack you. A or B are better.]

(;B[io]LB[ko:A]C[Was 69 too far? Should it have been A?
It looked like a good idea, reducing white's lower territory... It didn't work though...

D: See variations.];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[ln]LB[fc:A][kf:C][jm:D]
[en:B]C[D: This move doesn't threaten anything. If you played this to connect your stones, D would have been better. Better play A to C.]
;W[no]
(;B[op];W[pp];B[po]C[D: This move is really small. The top is so big! Why not play there now?]
;W[qp]LB[kr:A][nr:B]C[I think I should have sacrificed Q5, didn't get me any point, letting my opponent capture it  would have gotten me up to two free moves (one for letting him atari, another if he captured).
I think I should have gone under with A

D: I now realize, that you have to add another move at the bottom, or you will die. With A Black lives, but it gives White a lot of good sente moves around. That is why B should be your choice.]

;W[ke]LB[lg:A]C[I guess I should have taken care of the weakness at now... it made me lose some points in the middle at the end...
