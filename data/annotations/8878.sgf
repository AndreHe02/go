C[The point of playing the shimari at Q3 and R5 early in the game is generally to aim at someplace around K4, which is the start of a nice framework.  Since both of you have played two stones in one respective corner, I think it's even more important to play around there before your opponent can.]

(;B[me]C[Play K16 instead, which serves the dual purpose of harassing White, and making your group at the top stronger.

You don't necessarily have to kill your opponent's groups.  Make him have a difficult time getting eyes on one side, while you take a bunch of territory on the other side.]

;W[qm];B[jp]C[Good!];W[mq];B[nq]C[The rule of thumb is that you should attack from the weaker side to push your opponent toward your strength.  I think I'd play L3 or M3 instead, or even G3.]
;W[nr];B[np];W[mp];B[or];W[mo];B[lr]C[This is a move that makes White do something he'd want to do anyway, and gives you a weakness.  Better to play L3 or G3 instead]
;W[mr];B[kq];W[no];B[pp];W[jr];B[hr]TR[jp]C[Most of the time when you play two stones like this, you can almost expect your opponent to try to split them.  I'd play H4.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[ir];B[hp]C[You haven't reduced White to enough liberties to capture him in a net.]

(;B[co]C[There's not much appealing here.  D5 gives you a false eye at E5, so that doesn't work.  I think I'd play G7 instead.  You're going to have to run out toward the center, so why not start now?]
;W[do];B[eo];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm];B[il]C[This has to be closer to the weak group on the left.  You're inviting White to jump to H7 which is both a natural move for him *and* puts pressure on the group on the left.]

(;B[ni]TR[oi][pi]C[I think you should have split at R11.  You still have the opportunity to run out to P9, or put pressure on the stones at P/Q11, depending on what White does.  See the variations.]

(;B[qi];W[pk];B[cq]TR[pf][qf][qg][qh]C[Not that you're in a good situation, but I think you need to continue an attack on the White stones in the top right, by playing at S11.]
