AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[lc];B[nc]C[Xom: Good.];W[fc];B[cf]LB[id:A]
C[Xom: Good. (A also possible.)];W[jq];B[pj]LB[ic:A][pj:6]C[Xom: B 6 is not bad, but I would've challenged White's tenuki by invading at A.]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[Xom: Good.];W[qm];B[qo]C[Xom: Good.];W[on];B[nq]
C[Xom: Good.];W[ch];B[cj]LB[db:A][cj:14]C[Xom: B 14 is perfectly playable, but I would've made the corner strong with A.]
;W[eh];B[ef]C[Xom: Good. I'm going to stop saying "good", "good", because it's a long game, so don't regard my silence as significant (for example, B 18 is also a fine, totally standard move).]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[ej]
(;B[bh]C[jjc: Attempting to connect underneath here seems to have been a mistake, as it seem to put the B corner under a lot of pressure.

Xom: You missed the way to connect (see variation).];W[bi];B[ci]

(;W[dh]
(;B[bj];W[bg];B[ai];W[cg]
(;B[cl]LB[bf:A]C[jjc: This might have been unnecessary, it doesn't appear that W can kill directly, and blacks group on the top seems to need the help more urgently.

Xom: I agree. I'd play A instead (see variation).];W[bf];B[ce]
;W[db];B[gf];W[fg];B[ge]LB[gd:A]C[Xom: A instead is the proper shape (then it's a bad exchange for White); you almost got it!]
;W[hd];B[dc];W[cb]C[jjc: Possibly a bad exchange for black, giving white more security without a great deal in return.

Xom: Yes.];B[eb]C[jjc: A tesuji that turned out to be poorly timed (given the status of blacks group).]
;W[ec];B[gc];W[gd];B[fb];W[fe]C[jjc: This forcing move prevents the black tesuji from working.

Xom: See variation.];B[ee];W[fd];B[hc];W[bd];B[ff];W[id]
(;B[jb];W[jc];B[ib];W[kb];B[ic]C[jjc: Maybe white can just fix at K16 instead? White still has forcing moves against the black group, and should be able to connect up in the corner.]
;W[ea];B[jd];W[kc];B[ga];W[je];B[kd];W[le];B[ie];W[ke];B[he]
;W[ld];B[jd]C[Xom: Save k16 and e16 for later.];W[kd];B[ed]
;W[jd];B[be];W[ae];B[bc]
(;W[bb]C[jjc: This might have been a mistake by white? (see variation).

Xom: I added a branch.];B[cd];W[ac];B[ad];W[gb];B[hb];W[bd]
;B[ja]LB[af:A]C[jjc: This move now seems pointless, black should probably start running his eye-less group out to the centre instead, rather than allowing white to resolve the KO.

Xom: Very pointless move. By the way, A is still a local ko threat. After A, Black should run, I agree.]
;W[da];B[fa];W[cc];B[hh];W[ki];B[eg];W[fh];B[jg];W[kg];B[jh]
;W[qf];B[rc]LB[pf:A][kh:B]C[Xom: IMHO attach at A instead, and see if you can get sente to push and cut at B.]
;W[of];B[pl];W[qn]LB[pg:A]C[jjc: This may have been a bad exchange for black. Blacks shape is helped slightly, but now the bottom right corner is under increasing pressure from an invasion.

Xom: Considering q10's needs, it's only slightly bad. A would be really good though.]
;B[nl];W[mn];B[ll];W[qq]
(;B[po]LB[ro:B][qp:C][pq:A]C[Xom: A, B, or maybe C (I don't know much about C).]
;W[om];B[pq];W[ol]C[jjc: Ignoring this peep was probably too large, white ended up making a large territory on the bottom by cutting these stones off and threatening blacks running group on the top.

Xom: B q5–W p7 was quite a bad exchange.];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj]
;W[mk];B[mj];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk]C[Xom: Push through (see variation)!]

;B[kh]C[Xom: Finally. =)];W[pg];B[lq]C[jjc: This move seems slow. I think I was trying to make sure the black group had room to make eyes if R3 was ever reactivated. It might have been better to just play inside instead?

Xom: Black's lower right was already secure. Play elsewhere.]
;W[fq];B[dq]C[Xom: Good move.];W[kp];B[dn]LB[ek:A][hq:B]C[jjc: Fixing here might have been bad for black. White now builds a large centre.

Xom: A or B instead IMHO.];W[fn];B[hk]C[jjc: Too deep? White minimises the effect of this reduction.

Xom: Apparently so. The center is hard to read.];W[kj];B[lh]

;B[np];W[mp];B[kf]C[jjc: A big mistake for black here, I needed to play P1.]
;W[os];B[sk]C[jjc: This move seems to work, threatening to kill white on the top in exchange for black on the bottom (a good result for black).]
;W[pe];B[rl];W[ql];B[rm];W[sh];B[sn]C[jjc: Black needs to avoid the threat of a KO for life on the bottom.]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[cr]C[jjc: Black blunders, no need to fight a KO here, it would seem.]
;B[es];W[ha];B[ia];W[ds];B[bs];W[br];B[es];W[cn];B[do];W[ds]
;B[li]C[jjc: And finally, the decisive blunder of the game. N8 was an actual threat, but might not have been big enough as white capturing on the bottom may have been sente (tho' black does have a follow up in cutting at N7).]
