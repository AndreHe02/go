;B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[nd];W[qj];B[qh];W[qn];B[pn]C[Black only helps white here because white become stronger and black will perhaps lose any possibility of a severe invasion of the thin white group.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[jp];B[mq];W[ic];B[cf];W[di];B[fc]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ch]LB[ce:a]C[Black 'a' is perhaps more normal. Now white 'a' become very good shape.]
;W[ce];B[ci]LB[eh:a][bf:b]C[Black 'a' or 'b' is perhaps better in principle.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[bf];B[fe]LB[gd:a][hd:b][dk:c]C[Black 'a' or 'b' is better locally. Black plays too close to  the white strong shape here. I think 'b' is best but the black group on the left is heavy and black should perhaps  instead play 'c' before it is too late.]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[lc]LB[he:a]C[White 'a' would not give Black a chance to take a breath, but locally this is of course a good extension.]
;B[mc];W[ld]C[This exchange is good for white strategically.]
;B[dk]C[This is a very good move for Black, and the price white has to pay for developing the upper side. Perhaps white should have played here first trying to keep up the pressure on all black groups.]
;W[fj]TR[di][dj]LB[cn:a][he:b]C[This is heavy. The two marked stones are completely useless after the Black hane, and that make a defense of those stones useless as well. White 'a' and 'b' look like good points to consider instead.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[db];W[gd];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[fh]
C[This is again useless. The white stones  the center is not even connected securely]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[gf];W[fg];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[if]LB[id:a]C[This is thin - the cut at 'a' can become a problem, but I agree that this is the point one want to play here locally.]
;B[hg]LB[bc:a]C[Black is alive already and the moves that follow help white I think. Black should play elsewhere or perhaps 'a' if safety is urgent. That move could threaten the left side white group in the future.]
;W[jh];B[hi];W[jj];B[hk];W[fl];B[ek];W[fk];B[bc];W[bd];B[bb]
;W[bh];B[pk];W[qk];B[pj];W[pl];B[oh];W[qc]LB[oc:a]C[Perhaps white 'a' is the vital point to probe Blacks response.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[rd];W[nf]LB[oc:a][pb:b][od:c]C[The sequence 'a', 'b' and 'c' seem to give black some hard problems to solve. I think (no promise) that it would be easy for white to escape no matter what black does after that sequence.]
;B[oc];W[pf];B[me]TR[oh][qh][pj][pk]C[This is dangerous. The marked Black group on the right side could become very weak.]
;W[ng]LB[qe:a][rc:b]C[If white play 'a' black has to play 'b'. The move in the game does little to help whites group and nothing to ruin the day for the black stones.]
;B[qg]LB[qe:a]C[Good move. Now white 'a' is a meaningless move.]
;W[pe]C[And this is even worse because it is not even sente!]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[lh];W[mh];B[kf]C[This give White the chance to escape]
;W[mj];B[lj]C[Looks strange to me.];W[nk]LB[li:a]C[White 'a' would makethe shape of  black full of holes and white thick locally in sente.]
;B[nh]C[This is a strong move - it exposes whites thin shape before white get a chance to fix it in sente.!]
;W[mg];B[kh]LB[mi:a]C[This is too kind. Black 'a' would capture White easily.]
;W[mi];B[jf]LB[je:a][lb:b]C[This is premature. White has no profitable defense here so Black should concentrate on a double attack on the white weak groups and perhaps use 'a' and/or 'b' to try to kill white or get points in the endgame.]
;W[je];B[rf]LB[qi:a]C[The best move here locally is 'a'];W[pi]
;B[og]C[Bad peep - White counter peeps and black looses sente.]
;W[ne];B[ig];W[mb];B[md];W[nb]C[It looks like black has been greedy here: catching small fish in the center and losing the big fish off the hook on the upper side.]
;B[ob];W[lk];B[kj];W[kk];B[hq];W[hp];B[jq];W[iq];B[ir];W[ip]
;B[jr];W[hr]LB[gq:a][gr:b][fq:c][fr:d][eq:e][er:f][ep:g][eo:h]
[gp:i][go:j][fo:k][dq:l]C[Does this really work? Black seems very likely to manage if the black stones try to escape. But in fact the long sequence beginning with 'a' captures black. If both players saw this I am impressed.]
;B[rp];W[bq];B[em];W[np]C[Dangerous];B[nq];W[op]LB[mo:a]C[What happens if Black plays 'a'? I think that would capture the white stones.]
;B[oq];W[po];B[mp]C[This is of course a splendid result for white, but I think Black was tricked here.]
;W[no]LB[mo:a]C[White 'a' is a clever way of playing hereand despite the cutting moves Black cannot do anything.]
;B[mo];W[nn]LB[mn:a]C[Still 'a' is perhaps the strong move.]
;B[mn];W[nm]LB[mm:a]C[And 'a' as well.];B[kp]LB[gq:a];W[bo]

;B[bk]LB[ah:a]C[Black 'a' defends as well.];W[dn]LB[ro:a][ik:b]
C[This is small even if black answers. White 'a' and perhaps 'b'  is very big now]
;B[dm];W[fn]C[This look very slow compared to the alternatives.]

;B[im];W[hn];B[ei];W[fi];B[ej]LB[hs:a][ro:b][ri:c]C[Capturing here is worth 5 points. Black 'a', 'b' and 'c' are all much bigger.]
;W[dc]LB[cf:a][be:b]C[???? White is alive with secure eyes at 'a' and 'b'.]

;W[mm]LB[ik:a][hl:b][hj:c]C[White 'a' could now cut off a lot of black stones.]
;B[ll];W[mk];B[nl];W[lm]C[Good move];B[kl];W[jl]LB[ik:a]C[White 'a' captures more black stones.   From now on the endgame is not that interesting, even if the game is very close. But I have added some general comments in the end.]

;B[tt];W[tt]C[I think this game was dominated by many missed tactical opportunities so my advice to both players is to sharpen the tactical reading in middle game fighting.

* Also remember to not play close to your own and your opponents strength.   * Try to find moves that attack many groups simultaneously.

* Do not defend useless stones.

* Do not destroy aji, before you now there are no alternatives.

* Do not overlook sente moves that your opponent can  take away immediately.

All of this apply to one or more of the previous comments,
and all of them has to become fundamental instincts in your play in order to improve your playing strength.]
