AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, 
I'll be your reviewer. I'll quote your messages like it :

And I'll answer as it.
For your main question, how did you win ? By having more territory than him ;)
For the long explanation, let's review the game but the short answer : he was too passive in his game.]
PL[W];W[qj]TR[pf][qf]SQ[nc][nd][ph][qh]C[Ok, so this is his first mistake : he plays something without attacking. The main strategy for white would be to attack black with two main ideas : 
- cutting
- building territory

A common start may be at the triangle points, usually on the third line and common answer may be the squares]
;B[cj]C[Ignoring R10 is good, but in such situation, you would prefer D10 to build more influence.]
;W[jp]C[Not good again I think];B[nq]TR[jd]SQ[mq]C[Too small here. The 2 spaces extensions are good when you're attacked.
The three space keyma (square) may be used to annihilate an opposite big influence, for example a vertical wall around bottom left corner.
Here, I would have played K16 to build a huge moyo at the top, good luck to the unlucky white player then :)]
;W[qn]C[very small]
(;B[ro]C[I've seen some player playing this, but I don't like it. Not sure it's good or not. You can play somewhere else or maybe Q6 to force answers and build a good influence with the aim of attacking K4 in the future]
;W[rn];B[qo];W[lq]C[Too early maybe, K6 is not in danger and there's big points on other sides, at the top for example]

(;B[mr]C[that's very small here. Remember : always push week stones in front of your strong stones.]
;W[hd]C[This is quiet far away];B[md]C[quiet bad here too. Try to find bigger points. 
If you want to attack, play at K16 for example, of maybe H4. I would not play R13 but it may be an other option, don't know. Q6 may be a possibility, but maybe too early]
;W[kc]
(;B[nb]C[What's the objective of this ? If you want to protect the top right side, N17 is the answer]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[ed]C[> Here I wonder whether pushing on e18 before e15 would have been better, but the variation I see looks like a disadvantage for me. 

E18 is a bad move, too small. E15 is better.

I don't think it's a good move. You would prefereS16 or R12 (see variations)]

(;B[se]C[why this ? It would not be at your advantage in yose

Such moves may be ok with a stone in R16]

This protects the bottom, why not.

Not sure O3 works];B[fp]

A bit late maybe but it may still work]

It should not work, black has no weakness and white not enough place to build two eyes]

Result: B+31.5

> And ... surprising to me ... I win by a very wide margin. I am almost a beginner, and the questio bothers me: why did I win, or maybe, why did he lose?

The main reason : he was too passive in his game for a handicap game. Some mistakes too. Low ranks don't mean lot, just play and you'll see, you'll progress quiet fast.
Try to understand good and bad forms, start learning basic tsumego and maybe first moves of common josekis. It may help you to progress quiet fast.

Hope you enjoyed the review and have fun with go :)
