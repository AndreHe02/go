C[Dear reviewer,
one theme which occurs several ime during the game is weak white groups, which black fails to kill. I've added comments at these positions, were i decided to go for a hunt - could you give your opinion about these positions?
At the end i wrote down my overall impression for this game - would you agree?
Thanks in advance!

Hi. I am the reviewer of the game, KH. If you have any more questions, feel free to email me.]

[pr][rr][sr][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Obviously i suffered from many tactical blunders. But i'm not sure about the reason: am i too weak to kill "dead" groups, or was it just normal to fail because it simply can't be done?
I think my strategy was faulty - when being ahead, i should calmly "carry it home", and welcome opportunities to attack a weak group not to kill, but let it live and get additional strength to get more firmly ahead.
In addition i lack fighting spirit - i tend to play weak once things start to go wrong. But that's something i simply have to remember, it's not a "go issue"...

KH: My overall comments are that you tend to lack a little in calculation, sometimes you should tenuki when there is no need to protect with another move. Only when really doubtful should you connect. Do protect as well, for example, the group of G 10 stones lived as you failed to capture it earlier.
You can try attacking with the purpose of forcing your opponent to just connect a chain a stones while you get more territory. You do not have to kill every time. However, you should kill when presented the opportunity to. In the game, there were several tesujis that you missed out. 
Also, try to respond locally in a fight, as a fight  usually means that more stones are better. When faced with multiple weak groups, you can attack one of them to gain influence to kill the others. 
Overall, you can gain more insights of strategy and improve your reading to increase your skill in go. Have fun! Bye.]
