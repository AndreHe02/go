C[[Shashka\] - Hi, I was white in this game. I seemed to have the upper hand in the beginning and then... it slipped away. In the end, my stones were all more or less connected and my opponent had several separated groups, but they all lived and he had at least 20 points more than me when I resigned.

I'd appreciate any general or specific advice; I don't know whether the problem is in order of plays, missing tesuji or what. Or even whether I'd misread the situation in the beginning.

Heya, I'm Fey, your reviewer. I'm a 1-Dan from Germany, not that much stronger than you, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
I commented for both sides, as that makes reviewing a lot easier.
My comments are preceded by "fey:".
 
Be sure not to miss the variations I give along the way and see my final summary at the end of the .sgf file.

If there's anything you'd like to discuss about the game or if you have any further questions or remarks, feel free to contact me.

Sorry that reviewing took a little longer, I really tried my best but was awfully busy. 

Best wishes,

[no]C[fey: This might be the wrong direction - White can still play Q15 to press Black down on the right side, so Black can't really expect to gain anything from the influence he builds on the right by playing Q8.

Simply playing something like O4 is maybe preferable.]
(;W[oq]C[fey: This is not White's best move, and if Black plays the joseki correctly, White will be stuck for a good continuation afterwards. (var.)]
;B[or];W[op]
(;B[nq]C[fey: This move is only playable when the ladder to the upper left corner works for Black. As that isn't the case here, Black should play O2. O3 is overplay.]
;W[pr];B[nr];W[qq];B[ps];W[qr];B[jq]C[fey: This result is good for White, obviously. You can look forward to the Q11 pincer on the right side, and Black's position on the lower egde doesn't feel balanced. The K3 stone would be better placed at J3, as this works better with the C4 komoku, but that would leave the O3 group in even bigger trouble.]
;W[cf];B[jc]C[fey: This is not a pincer against the P17 stone. I think Black should play either N17 or N16, as this puts real pressure on P17, but on the other hand, it might be a good idea to defend the right side with a move like Q14.
I think Black wants a bit too much here and neglects his own weak points...]

(;W[lc]C[fey: This move is reasonable, but you could also consider playing R14 directly. (var.)]
;B[gc];W[qf]C[fey: Good move. :-)];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc]
C[fey: Obviously Black should play R15 here.];W[pd];B[qe];W[pe]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[of];W[pi];B[qb];W[ep]TR[od][oe][of][pf][mf]C[fey: This move is not important at the moment, the focus should lie on the marked group. If Black runs out by playing N14, for example, it will be White who finds himself in the defensive, busy to defend both his group on the upper side and on the right.]
;B[gq];W[fo];B[dq];W[mf]C[fey: As stated above, this move should be played without the exchange in the lower left.
Still, you were lucky to get to play this move.];B[md];W[nc]
;B[qi]TR[pl]SQ[pi][qg][qf]C[fey: I don't really understand this move. If Black wants to aid his marked stone, the O8 ikken tobi is much more effective, *and* it doesn't destroy the aji in White's marked group right away.]
;W[ph];B[qj];W[pj];B[pk];W[ni];B[ld]C[fey: This is too early. Again Black misses the important area of the board. He should hurry to defend his weak group on the right side.]
;W[qm];B[nk];W[lj];B[nm];W[mo]LB[rl:1][rk:2][ql:3][qk:4]C[fey: Maybe exchanging 1 - 4 before playing here would be worth considering. That makes the game really tough for Black.]
;B[ll];W[ln];B[lp];W[co]TR[ep][fo]C[fey: This move seems a bit vague to me.
Your two marked stones are rather light, so they aren't in need of immediate defense.
You can't hope to gain any territory by playing C5, too, though your move would be rather powerful with a white stone at E3.

Right now, there's basically only one important thing on the board: Black's rather weak group on the right.
There is no need for an attack right now, especially considering that you don't have any superb attacking moves at the moment, but you should keep attacking that group in mind, trying to play moves that might prove helpful for the future attack.]
;B[ck]
(;W[dl]TR[ch][bo]C[fey: I'd say that this isn't a good move. Normally, a shoulder hit is played to reduce a big moyo, not to attack, for it has the drawback of strenghtening your opponent by granting him the D9 nobi.

As Black can still resort to either B5 or C12, attacking might be quite difficult in any case, so maybe the var. is worth considering.]
;B[dk];W[fl];B[cl];W[dm];B[ch]C[fey: Not absolutely necessary at the moment, C12 and B5 are still miai. But better safe than sorry. ;-)]
;W[jo]C[fey: The K7 keima or even the K6 ikken tobi would put more pressure on Black.]
;B[jl];W[jj];B[ql]C[fey: As stated above, White should exchange his forcing moves here before.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[pm];W[pn];B[nj];W[oj]TR[mi]C[fey: This is a bit odd. 
The normal move is N11 here, and you should be happy to be forced to play it, as it patches up some of your cutting points.
P10 is kind of greedy - all-out killing attempts like this are unlikely to succeed.]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[nh];W[ng];B[oi]C[fey: This result feels painful for White, even though Black is not completely alive yet, White's position looks far too thin now to attempt a kill.]
;W[lh];B[ho]C[fey: A daring move, seemingly inspired by a "catch me if you can" attitude.
Though, I don't really understand why Black played it - it neither expands nor reduces any significant territory, and it creates new potential trouble for Black's right side group.]
;W[im]C[fey: Good.];B[gm];W[il]TR[gm]C[fey: Nice one. Black's marked stone doesn't pose much of a threat to your left side group, it can easily be cut off, and your stones have plenty of space to run out.]
;B[jk];W[ik];B[ij];W[li];B[mc];W[ne];B[jm];W[jn];B[nn];W[ml]
;B[mk]
(;W[lk]C[fey: What about the var. instead?];B[lm];W[km];B[mm]
;W[kl]TR[eq][bo][ef]C[fey: White deserved a better result here, capturing 3 stones in gote is just not big enough at the moment.
Right now, the best move for White is probably tenuki, all the marked points are bigger than your actual move.]
;B[bo];W[eq]C[fey: Good.];B[cd]
(;W[cc]C[fey: This invasion is tough for White, but I wouldn't like to see my stones get separated like this.
I'd prefer playing D16 instead. (var.)];B[dd];W[ed];B[bc];W[bd]
;B[be];W[de];B[ce];W[bf];B[ad];W[ee];B[bb]TR[eg][he][eh][dh]
C[fey: White's shape is horrible, and you should definitely play a move that helps to patch up your cutting points, maybe something around the marked points.]
;W[kc]C[fey: This is overplay, and Black needn't answer this moves which threatens only three rather unimportant stones.]

(;B[jd]C[fey: Black should absolutely tenuki here and play as in the var. This is just too small.]
;W[mb];B[kd]C[fey: Too small again. You're both missing the important point.]
;W[eb]C[fey: If you want to protect this cut, F17 is a better move to do so - better shape, and secures you better eye space.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[dg];W[he]C[fey: Good. Protecting the two stones would spell certain doom over our group, this lighter approach is much better.]

(;B[df]C[fey: Likewise, this move is not important for Black. He doesn't even rob you of an eye by playing here.
Instead, he should start securing life for his own weak group, maybe with a sequence similar to that in the var.]
;W[ha]C[fey: I created my own go proverb some time ago, and it says "The monkey jump doesn't kill." Like all proverbs, mine has exceptions, but I believe it to be a good guideline in many cases.

Firstly, I think that you should secure life for your own group first before you go ahead and try to kill Black's.

Secondly, you have much better killing moves. Locally, the simple nobi down to L18 might be best, followed by some eye space reducing move from the left side.]
;B[jb];W[ka];B[ja];W[lb];B[ga];W[gb];B[fb];W[hb];B[hc];W[hd]
;B[ib];W[id];B[ia];W[hb]C[fey: This whole attack is too early. Right now, you absolutely *can't* hope to kill Black, you're not even alive yourself!
Try and hold your stones together, attack only from secure positions, and don't go all out when you're on the verge of dead yourself and still have other ways to escape or secure life.]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[fe];W[ef];B[gf];W[fh];B[gg];W[dh];B[bg];W[if]
C[fey: Overplay. Concentrate on defending your E14 group first, you can't afford to atttempt to save all of your stones here.]

fey: To my mind, you got off the better start in this game, and there were several opportunities where you could have put Black in enough trouble to make the game basically unwinnable for him.
Somehow, you didn't manage to use those chances to the best, sometimes due to reading mistakes, sometimes because you were too greedy and sometime because you tenukied too early or too late.
It's hard to assess your strategic mistake, as this game was heavily dictated by fighting and both sides missed the important point a couple of times.

One advice I'd give you is to try and play more focused. Try to think for the best strategic plan, and execute it thoroughly. That doesn't mean that you have to start one blunt attack after the other, but it means keeping your goal in mind and constantly working to accomplish it.

You should also think more carefully about when to tenuki and when to add another move.

One thing that both Black and White should work on is the assessment of weak and strong groups.
Try and evaluate the status of each of your groups.
If you already have one weak group, you shouldn't attack your opponent in a way that harms your own group. Generally, securing life for your own stones first is prior to anything else, and even if moves like that might look slow, I can ensure you that you won't regret playing them more often in your games.
If you spot a weak group of your opponent's, try to think of a way to attack it in a profitable way. Don't try to kill unless you are absolutely sure that you can kill.
Re-reading "Attack and Defense" will be helpful sharpening your sense for weak and strong groups.]
