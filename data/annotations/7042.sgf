(;B[po]C[

TheSarge: This sort of contact play makes both sides stronger, and so it is most often useful when defending, and not so much when attacking. Try attacking from a little farther away, forcing white to try and make eye space. See my alternate approaches]
;W[jd];B[op];W[qp];B[qo];W[ec];B[dc];W[oq];B[oo];W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[TheSarge: Another easy tip to remember: always try to avoid making an open triangle shape like you have with moves 1, 11, and 15. This is a weak shape that minimizes your own liberties.]

(;W[np];B[do]C[TheSarge: again same as before, try a different style of attack on the 4-4]
;W[pm]C[TheSarge: Here is a good attack by white. Instead of pressing right against your group, he comes from the outside and destroys all the influence your group was making towards the middle.]

(;B[gp]C[TheSarge: This move is unnecessary at the time. You already had that group of white stones killed, and your stones were not in danger yet.]
;W[hq]
(;B[iq]C[TheSarge: Again, this is an unneeded move. See that square of black stones? That clump is another clear sign that something is going wrong. This move is unneeded because your groups are still connected and in no danger.]
;W[bl];B[fk];W[ck];B[fl];W[ei];B[gi];W[gg];B[fh]C[TheSarge: Good idea here. You cant let white claim an area that big that easily, and this is a good weak spot to strike at]
;W[eh];B[fg];W[fe];B[eg];W[de];B[dg];W[ed]
(;B[db]C[TheSarge: Try at E18 instead, white cannot cut];W[eb]
;B[da]C[TheSarge: Generally, dont play on the first line until late game or unless absolutely necessary. This is a 1 point move at most, and there are still much bigger moves left.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[bf];B[cg];W[ac];B[ad];W[ae];B[ab];W[ad];B[bb]
;W[bg]
(;B[ca]C[TheSarge: This move is unnecessary. If you read it through, playing at either C19 or C18 will give the group life, so white cannot kill it. If he played at one, you can play at the other. Playing here now only wastes your turn and actually costs you a point of your own territory.]
;W[bh];B[ef]C[TheSarge: See the two empty triangles this move makes?]
;W[ea];B[ee];W[dh];B[cf];W[be]C[TheSarge: Again, empty triangle. You gain nothing from this move, and you let him solidify his weaknesses]

;B[pg];W[bi]
(;B[dl]C[TheSarge: This is what you need to do more often. See how you dont play the open triangle contact move at E8, and you gain much more from it?]
;W[el];B[ek];W[dk];B[em];W[cl];B[di];W[ff];B[dj];W[el]
(;B[ei]C[TheSarge: This move is also unnecessary. The group is alive, there is no way for white to kill it even before your move at E11]
;W[df];B[dl]C[TheSarge: This ko isnt going to decide any groups fate or the control of any territory, so i'd leave it alone. its worth one or two points, and there are much bigger moves in the top right left.]
;W[hf];B[md]C[TheSarge: Like this one];W[gd];B[ii];W[kg];B[mg]
;W[ki];B[mj];W[kl];B[kr];W[ml];B[nk];W[kn];B[ij];W[lc];B[mc]
C[TheSarge: The last group of moves is much better];W[ld];B[ih]
;W[aj];B[ig];W[jf];B[if];W[he];B[hg];W[ie];B[hh];W[gf]C[TheSarge: Those last two moves dont give you much, and you get a clump of stones. I'd play something bigger.]

;B[kj];W[mh];B[nh];W[kf];B[ng];W[me];B[ne];W[mb];B[mf];W[le]
;B[nc]C[TheSarge: There are a few situations where the open triangle is allowed. Good eye spotting the situation here. If you had played at O18, you would have been in trouble.]
;W[kb];B[nb];W[kp];B[js];W[lp];B[rp];W[mp];B[nq]C[TheSarge: all in all, try and be a little more 'light' in your moves. Try not to clump together and try to attack from a small distance. Also, try and work on determining when your groups are alive and when they need more defending.]
