C[Hi! Thank you for reviewing my game. I played black. It was fairly peaceful (nothing died for either side) but I was too far behind entering late endgame and resigned. As such, it's fairly representative of my play, so hopefully you can point out some overall principles/weakness for me to work on. I've added a few comments/questions, but would appreciate any help you can offer. Thanks!

Jonathan


KKMD: Yes, a fairly peaceful game, too peaceful actually... You jumped directly from fuseki to yose. You missed a chance to attack, fell behind and after that the game went downhill. I would say the room for improvement in your play is in the transition between the fuseki and the middle game, when weak groups run and moyos get erased or invaded.]

KKMD: Excellent.];B[cp];W[po]
(;B[oc]C[I wanted to establish some position on right to support pincer against bottom right. Maybe variation is better? Or wrong idea?

KKMD: The idea is good, why didn't you follow up?];W[nc];B[pc]
;W[md];B[qf]LB[pe:a]C[KKMD: If the idea is to pincer the white stone, you might want to make the right side bigger by playing A instead.]
;W[ic];B[np]C[KKMD: If you first idea was to pincer, why didn't you do it? Then again, your actual move is probably better: the bottom side is bigger than the right side, which would be hard de develop.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[eq]C[KKMD: I would rather extend on the left side, waiting for an occasion to pincer white if he approaches this corner, but I think your move is fine too, since you can answer a white extension on the side by a sansan invasion, as you did in the game.]
;W[cj];B[cl]LB[di:a]C[KKMD: That is the first move of yours I have serious doubts about. I can see that you're trying to develop your shimari, and perhaps have the idea of forcing white to commit himself to playing in the center before invading, but it's better to invade right away, or even better, to erase the white's moyo by playing at A before invading. The problem is that you are obviously not going to win a battle of moyos: if both players play natural moves to expand their moyos, white will have an easy win, and by provoking white's answer, you give him a head start in the run for the center: not a good idea.]

;W[db];B[fa];W[cb];B[fd];W[ef];B[hd]LB[hc:a][ib:b]C[KKMD: 'A' instead would similarly strenghten white, but at least insure life. 'B' seems  even better.]
;W[id];B[gf]LB[hf:a][ie:b][ff:c]C[Should I have skipped h16 and played here directly? Or can I tenuki here to play on bottom?

KKMD: G14 directly would'nt work, because white could play H16 himself and that would be clearly worse than the game. But in this situation, G14 feels half-cooked. The moves that come to mind in this situation are A,B and C. Here B doesn't seem to work, and C doesn't help much, so I would try A.]
;W[jq];B[qi];W[ok];B[ie];W[je];B[if]LB[hc:a]C[These last two moves look slow now.

KKMD: Yes, it was urgent to be the first to play on the bottom side. This group can wait, it will either live easily with A or run.]

LB[fr:a][jf:b][gl:c][mn:d]C[Ok, here's where I tend to get stuck. At this point, I think B is just a little behind. All groups are relatively stable, and I don't have any obvious expansion points. In this sort of situation, I get confused and have no idea what to do. So, I tried to pressure the center white group, but I didn't really accomplish anything.

KKMD: If you keep playing these yose moves and white keeps answering them, you should be able to catch up. That could start with, say, A. It is too late to proceed in a more violent way, anyway: you deliberately simplified the position by starting the yose at an early stage. Actually, I think the position is still playable for black as long as white doesn't make territory in the center, but that shouldn't happen if black gets points like B, C, and/or D.]
;B[jp]LB[jr:a]C[KKMD: As it turns out, A was a better choice.]

KKMD: I find your evaluation pessimistic. You are behind, but not by that many, and given the level of the players, it is not unreasonable to play on for a little while.]
