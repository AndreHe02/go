C[Hello. I this game from DGS I play black. I had a really good feeling from the fuseki but than I must have made bad mistakes in the middle game. Thank you very much for doing the review.

Hello, I am looking forward to the review. I am known as Tapir on GTL and elsewhere.]

Tapir: Generally, count if you want to know whether defending is enough or not. Turn based games are a good opportunity to start with it. This is a try. Usually one tries to imagine all the sente moves, for moves that are gote for both you need to middle it out somehow. (Either minimal count for both or something in between, in the lower left corner I counted the minimum for both, in the upper right I tried to middle it out.)

General Comment:

You were ahead early in the game, both the bottom left and the top right corner were good for you. You lost your advantage probably when your attack on the top group ended with you running with your group without making territory, but you had other chances as your opponent made mistakes as well. 

You lost sente three times for free, H10 A and K4 B, both moves look like played by instinct in a moment of anger, because of your own previous move did not work, or your opponent did not answer, P14 C was just hasty. 

The review emphasizes counting very much, as this is what I am trying to apply in my games right now, that is to count before deciding which way to go, this may also help against moves like K4 and H10. And turn-based games (DGS is turnbased isn't it?) are a good opportunity to exercise counting.

Another area of improvement maybe more actively considering ko fights as part of your repertoire. Especially a ko like H4 (D), which is more easy to see. I admit that I probably would not be able to correctly calculate all the long sequences involving kos etc. I gave for the top edge fights in a real game myself and I changed them several times while making the review.

Thank you very much, Tapir.]N[RESULT])
