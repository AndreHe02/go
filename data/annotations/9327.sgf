C[Thank you for reviewing my game!

I thought this game was pretty even until White attacked my base on the top. This is one of those games where I'm not really sure where I went wrong.

Perhaps I was just too focussed on making a giant wall across the board and should have been focusing more in reducing, invading, protecting my weak groups and making better shape?]
;B[pd]C[Hi,
my name DaVince im 5 kyu on kgs. I´m not a Dan player so i don´t know everthing...
But feel free to ask me anything.
I mark my comments with"D:"];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cm]C[See variation for explaining 2 space extentions]

(;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[nc];B[qf]LB[lc:a][ld:b]C[D:This keeps the game more simple BUT w gets what he wants(top left side) other options are the pincers at A or B]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[od]LB[pe:a][pc:b]C[I've never seen this play before. Not sure if my response was good or not.


D: This move is Joseki! For joseki questions I recomend a online Joseki-dictionary like www.eidogo.com

A and B are the joseki moves both have the outcome that you get the top right side and w the top left side.]

(;B[oe];W[pe]LB[pf:a][qe:b]C[This is why the hane is not joseki it leavs too many weakpoints.
Hard to decide wich move to make now...
Maby A or B.]
(;B[qd]LB[pf:a][of:b][qe:c]C[D:This move is not so good for many reasons:
1. The empty triangle shape is not so good in most cases. 
2.It doesn´t prevent w from stretching out to A or B.
3.It Does not help the corner too much.For helping corne C would have been better]

(;W[ne];B[of];W[qb]
(;B[md]C[Ofc he answers your peep but...];W[nd];B[rb]LB[nf:a]
C[I wonder if A or some other point would be bigger at this point in the game?]
;W[nf];B[og];W[kf]C[Your stone feels pretty lonley now and is leanig against a big wall]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[ic]C[Good play!]
(;W[kc]C[This w is too passiv It just captures the one stone.]
;B[fc];W[de]LB[cg:a][cj:b][ci:c][eb:d][jb:e]C[I felt pretty good about these moves in sente and wondered if I should continue at A to float white's enclosure, but I wasn't sure how well that would work if white approached at B or C.

D: At this point you should keep in mind that your two space extion at the top is very weak! It looks good and is often seen in games but with so many w stones surrounding it it can be attacked easily. So to creat another weak group with A might not turn out well... See variation.
And in the game the top group died  and that cost you the game!

Maybe best is to use some more sente moves like D and E]
(;B[qk]TR[ng][og]C[With the marked stones one line higher is better!]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[pq]C[I'm surprised by this move, I expected 3-3 invasion. Did white avoid that so that I wouldn't get a big wall? How is my follow-up in this corner?]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[oq];W[pr]LB[op:a]C[Until here all was joseki but then B should defend at A]

(;B[np]C[You let the chance to give you atari and connect his stone!]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[rq];B[po];W[or];B[op]C[I was hoping to be more severe, but maybe this is all I can hope for?]
;W[dj]LB[cg:a][dg:b]C[White has a lot of high stones, on the left. Should I be thinking about invading around A or reducing around B? Should I have played here earlier?]
;B[mh]C[D: I think this was the best move!!];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij]C[Am I leaving too many cutting points at this point? Or do I just defend them poorly?

D:There are many cutting points but its also not so easy for white.]

(;W[nh]LB[li:a][ni:b]C[Simple things are often best!
Look the move at A]
(;B[mi]LB[ni:a]C[In hindsight this move looks sort of dumb to me. I was trying to make sure to have make sure I had enough liberties while also surrounding blacks cutting stone. But now I'm thinking that maybe the simple atari at A would have been better.

D: the empty triangle is a realy bad move for getting more liberties!]
;W[ni]
(;B[nj]C[Again you give the chance to give atari which is so dangerous and leeds to your failure in this position]
;W[mj];B[li]
(;W[oj];B[oi]C[Good idea or better just to defend the ataried stone?]
;W[nk];B[oh];W[jj]C[Of course now I realize my shortage of liberties.]

;W[nj];B[kj];W[jk];B[kk];W[jl];B[kl];W[il];B[jm];W[hk];B[im]
;W[hl];B[hj]C[I decided to run this group out a bit since the ladder is broken.]
;W[gj];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh];W[hg]C[I wasn't sure if I should keep running this group around here. I thought it might be able to cause some trouble, but couldn't see exactly how, so I didn't.

 D: Right choice];B[hm];W[gl];B[km]C[Tired of getting cut everywhere, so I fixed.]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[fo]LB[eb:a][jb:b]C[Here the board is almost seperatet but White has a living group in your  half so you have to do the same!
A then B!]
(;B[fp]LB[eb:a][jb:b]C[I'm guessing this was way to slow and I should have played something like A or B instead to settle my top group. Should I have settled them longer ago? Or woud they have been safe if I'd played better?


D: THIS IS THE MOVE THAT COST YOU THE GAME!!!

As i  already explained your two stones a the top are very weak(almost dead) their base can be destroyed very easy.]
;W[gb]C[I have no idea what to do here. In hindsight I think I spent to much time trying to contain the invading stone, when I should have been running and trying to make eyes.

In general I could use a lot of help understanding the 2 point extension base. Is it considered a stable/strong group so that I don't have to worry too much about it? Or is that only true while it's got space to run?

D: I made a Variation at the beginning  and tried my best to explain their weaknesses]
;B[fb];W[ib];B[jb]LB[db:c][hc:a][ed:b][fe:d]C[I'm guessing one of the lettered moves would have been better?

D: And what to do with these moves? Getting 2 eyes is a proiblem to hard to solve after white kicked your base away and with so many sourounding stones...]
;W[hc]C[Let him get good shape :/];B[ia];W[hb]C[I thought he might play a ko here, but maybe this is stronger since he has a lot to lose and not much to win from the ko?]
;B[id]LB[hd:a]C[I'm guessing I should have given up on the right half of this group by now? I still thought I had a chance to kill the invaders. I'm guessing for example A might have been stronger.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[ge];W[jd];B[ed];W[dd];B[if]C[Here I try playing sever forcing moves with the hope that the aji will help, but in hindsight I may have wasted the aji I already had. What do you think?]

Looking now maybe I could have just lived with A ... actually, see variations, it looks like I can't live there without some sort of trickery, but maybe A would still be a great ko threat compared to the minor one I played in the lower cornere?

D: When playing a ko about the living of a group use local threats first!And This move is not so big maybe 10-15 points...]
;W[gf];B[qq];W[sq];B[gg]LB[sp:a]C[Perhaps I should have saved this for a ko threat for the new ko in the lower corner and played A instead to reduce it?

Thanks again for reviewing my game!

D: It was a plasure to review your game!
 
3 Things to remember:

1. Empty traiangle is a bad shape(not always)
2. If you let your enemy the chance to give you atari think about the pro and contras and if maybe a solid connection would hae been better!
3. 2 Space extensions :-)])
