AB[pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer.

Thanks for reviewing my game. I played black (Mike 14k on KGS), and aside from a blunder of losing a group in the bottom, I thought I was doing OK. but I lost by about 40 points (i think thats more than the group was worth).

Please feel free to point out my mistakes, and I'll try to comment/question where I was unsure during the game.

B: Hi Mike, hope I can help. My name is Alex, aka Bluebottle. My comments will be prefaced by B:.]
;W[qp]C[Mike [14k\]: gg];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn]C[B: Playing at D6 here is also ok, because of the presence of the other star point. Don't do it for every approach, because then you will have all your stones on the fourth line, and high-low balance is important. But here, I'd say D6 is better.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[kq]
(;B[pj]C[I played this because I was worried about his right side becoming strong.

B: Yes, you are right that jumping in here is good, but there are better spots. See some of the variations.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[re];B[jc]TR[dc][fc][cf][ci][di]SQ[qm]
C[B: This point is perhaps too small. The top-right group is secure on its own. The left side is bigger, and now would be a good time to make the right safe.

Any of the triangled moves are very big in and of themselves.

The square move makes life for the right, and has follow up moves in the bottom right. If you had that point, a move at P4 is much better.

The message here is: if you have sente (early on), look for a move which protects and attacks. If nothing needs protecting, take the biggest point.]

(;B[fc]C[B:Here you could have played F16, but I prefer the joseki in the variation.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[ck]SQ[qm]C[B: This move is not great. As I mentioned in move 14, if you have the initiative, take the biggest move, especially if it protects something.

The right side has become the biggest, the left is very small. Even if he took the left with, say, C8, you still have the corner. So C9 does not protect. Again, R7 is bigger.]
;W[nf];B[jf]C[B: I can't say I like this move. It doesn't do much. You can't make anything on the right, because of O14 and gang, and the left is iffy too without a follow up move at E14.

If you are worried about losing inroads in the centre, there are better ways. Again, at R7. Alternatively, coming from the bottome left would be good. If you are feeling brave, you could try disrupting white's bottom with a move like H3 or H4. Or simply playing F4 of F5 gives you an in to the middle, and gives you follow up moves to attack the bottom even better.

If it's the top you're worried about, I think N15 would be best. It secures heaps on the righter side of the top. K13 leaves the top exposed.]
;W[eg]
(;B[nq]C[Looking back I dont think invading was correct, but where should I play?

B: You could have got away with this. There's no reason it had to die. It's just that the next stuff didn't quite pan out. A more secure connection, such as O7 for move 30 would have helped.

You could have played at P4. I think this would have been a much better play. This would have disrupted W just as well, but would have been closer to friends. P4 is the standard approach to the 3-4 point (and P3, but that's no good here).

Generally, 3rd line is for a base. If you hope to run, try 4th line, unless what you are running to is close.

The big problem with this move is that while W attacks it, he simultaneously builds territory up the side, AND this terrority attacks the Q10 stone. It forces him to do awesome stuff. Also, you have to consider exactly where you are running to. The Q10 stone is not alive. And everything is very far away. And living inside is extremely difficult.

Again, I'd say R7. Get a base, get lots of points. If he takes the bottom, well that's fine. You can't have everything. If he doesn't get the bottom, then you can attack it and get a big profit.]
;W[pq];B[no];W[qm];B[pm]C[B: Probably better O7 here.];W[pn]
;B[om];W[dr];B[cq];W[hp];B[hn]C[I didnt know where to play here... thought I should try to head towards the center.

B: Nothing wrong with this, although W should perhaps have followed up with F5. Alternatively you could try L6, M6 or something like that, since those stones are weakly connected. A move like that makes cutting difficult and expands you influence in the centre.]
;W[jo];B[fo];W[jm];B[hl];W[jk]TR[om][no]C[B: As white gets stronger in this line, the cut at P6/O7 becomes better and better. The knight's jump (marked) is not automatically connected. Usually it's fine because white gets two weak groups in doing so, but one is attached to the corner, and the other can run to the newly-made strength.

If something is connected to safety by a weak connection, keep considering it, even if your opponent seems to ignore it. They may just be waiting until it is easier.]
;B[hj];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[nl]C[B: This is futile. You can't kill this, not with the srength on the K line. If you want to run up, N7 (though I don't think that works here). Otherwise, try to make life, or let it die.]

(;B[np];W[mq];B[ql];W[rm];B[ej];W[dh];B[fh];W[ee]C[B: Maybe you could try F15 here. Otherwise you are wasting the K14 stone.]

;B[lj];W[qh];B[me]C[I think this was a mistake looking back. Closer to M13 would have been better?

B: It's about even. N14 guarantees territory up top, M13 gets you some down the middle. M13 may be a little better.]
;W[ne]
(;B[nd]C[B: Not necessary. He can't get in (see variations). It does get you a point to block here, but a point is not enough, when there are far bigger moves.]

[cp][aq][bq]C[B: Overall I think your biggest problem in this game was not securing the right hand side before attacking the bottom. Also there were a few overly defensive moves, and others that didn't have a clear goal.

Generally:

If you have sente, look for the biggest move that secures a group, makes territory, and/or has follow-up moves that threaten the opponent.

An invasion needs to either be able to make a base or run to something which has a base.

Just because your opponent has not cut something (yet) does not make it uncuttable.

There's a couple of useful josekis you have missed.

Play low for a base (3rd line).

I hope you've found this review useful.  My name is Bluebottle (8kyu) on KGS. If I'm on, feel free to talk, or ask for a review or teaching game.]
