C[Hello, my name is Michal and I play for about half a year now. I'm 9k on KGS and this is a game from there. I'm black, so please review that and mistakes of white I didn't see.

This was a heavy-fighting game. In the beginning I've made some big mistakes, so middle through I was thinking about resigning, but somehow I've managed to turn the game around. Any comments about my fighting methods, tesujis I didn't see and whole-board strategy in general would be very much appreciated.

Thanks!




-----------------------------------------------
FLC: Hello Michal. My name is Uwe aka Falcom and i reviewed your game.
My comments are marked with FLC:




My oppion of the Game:
You care to much about territory (it's normal for your level).
You tried to hard to make secure territory in the fuseki (beginning) and got a heavy group that died.
Play lighter and you will avoid such early trouble.

In all the fights your opponent started you play to close to his stones which helped him alot. 
=> http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontGetTooClose

In your attacks you need to think more about the direction and more practise in the endgame would improve your games.


You only missed one opportunity near the end. You punished all other mistakes.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[cp];B[oq];W[fq];B[qj]C[FLC: Here it would be better to play high on Q10 or even playing somewere else is possible. Maybe C11]
(;W[qg]C[FLC: White should not attack here O17 is better to attack]
;B[nc];W[og]
(;B[qe]C[Was taking the corner good or making a box-like shape with P10 better? How can I estimate value of such moves so early in the game? Is there a good estimation method?


FLC: I think the result is just fine for black. I would have played R15 first. 

Experience is the key to estimate the value of a move. 
When you play P10 white will reduce your corner territory and later on reduce your potentential territory on the bottom]
;W[jd]
(;B[de]TR[jd][dc]LB[cf:A]C[FLC: this move is to close to D17, because of the K16 stone.

It is better to play on C14. See Variations for details on how to play this move.]
(;W[bd]TR[cp][fq]MA[cj][ci]LB[dh:A][ce:B]C[This seemed strange, so I went for a good shape with C16 and B15. Was that good or was there a better answer to this white B16 move?


FLC: 
Normaly a pincer at  A would be a very good move for white, especially with the two marked stones in the lower left corner.
A move on B is good too.

See the variation for details.


It is very hard to find good moves when your opponent is playing strage ones.
But in general it is much better to play light.

The stone D15 isn't important, but after you played C16 your stones got heavy and a big fight startet.

Something around  C10 or C11 looks promising. ....]
(;B[cd];W[cc];B[be];W[ad];B[ae];W[bb]C[FLC: now your group is very heavy without any territory and white got the corner]
(;B[cj]C[This extension seems right, as I imagine those stones as a kind of 3-stones high wall (they are actually 4 stones, but I don't usually count a stone on a first line, is that correct?), so I extended 4 spaces. Should I extend further/closer? Third line is correct or would 4th line be better?


FLC: I would prefer the 4th line. A white play on C8 (the weak point of a high / 4th line play) is no problem and an invasion on c12 is impossible.

In this case a 3 space extension would be better, because your wall isn't that stable (C16) and it is very low. with a play on C11 no invasion is possible.
D10 is also possible];W[ch]
(;B[dh]C[FLC: here you think you can kill the invader. I think you can't.
It is better to take something in return unless you're sure you can catch him.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[dg]

;W[dk];B[dj];W[cl]
(;B[ek]C[FLC: to small again. keima would be better]
(;W[dm];B[el]C[FLC: to small.
Now is a good time to play somewhere else. Maybe K4 or P10 to attack.]
;W[em];B[bl]C[FLC: again play somewhere else instead of making 2 eyes.]
;W[bm];B[bk]C[So I've got an alive group with some influence. At the same time white has two corners, so it's not very good result, but the right side looks better for black here still. Correct?


FLC: 
The right side favors black, but the result on the left is way to bad. 
You don't need 2 eyes when your group is out into the open.
These last moves cost you alot of points.

White is now leading with ~25 Points.];W[qm];B[oj]C[FLC: good move, R10 is weak]

(;B[kb]C[I think ultimately it was this move that caused problems in the corner. Now it seems I could have played O18 first, which would protect my corner and threaten the cut at the same time. After that L17 looks good. What do you think?

You're right first O18. but the trouble started with this fight. Build strengh before you attack]

[rn:B][am:C][la:D][fl:E][jg:F][ke:G][dl:H]C[FLC: Lets take a break and compare the remaining End-Game moves.

There are different methodes to calculate the value of a move as you can see here
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Endgame#toc5


I reccomend that you study engame moves with your own games. You missed alot.

One methode is to calculate the difference in points the move would make and double the value if it is sente. Then play the move with the biggest value.
Other methodes are more accurate but also harder to explain.



All marks are for Black

A: 1 point gote

B: 6 points gote
Black catches 2 stones and gets S5, T5, T6 and T8 as territory
White can gain nothing.


C: 2 points sente worth 4 points
When black play C the sequence is
A7, A6, A8, B6

If white play first the sequence is A8, A9, A7

D: 3 points worth 6 points
When black plays on D white need to connect. Black can then play N19 but that will be gote


E: 1 point gote
F: 3 points gote
G: 1 point gote (for white it is sente)
H: 2 points gote

Move B is really big, thats why white played there. but for black it is better to first play C, D and then B.
In your endgame you played neither of them.];W[rn];B[si]C[Again, this seems unnecessary.

I think this position is cleary better for white.
White got the corner and an alive group directed to the center.
