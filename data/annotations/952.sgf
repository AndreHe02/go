;W[nc];B[pf];W[kc];B[mf]MA[jc][ic][hc][pc]C[generally one plays in the sequence corners-sides-center, as the "rule" says.

if you want to connect the k16 stone here, you should better play to the left of it. you could "block" w with k17 or make a wider jump to j17 or perhaps h17 to connect to your top-left-corner stone.
Another alternative is to block white from the top-right corner by q17.]
;W[jc]
(;B[jf]MA[ic][id]C[this one is unnecessary.  better block white from further extending to the left.
a "hard" block on j17 is possible, but it is saver to extend with white to the left (see variations).]
;W[hc];B[hf]MA[fc][ec][df]C[this one is no good either. you should hinder white from further extending. it would be a nice side-effect if you could build up own territory by blocking your partner.
f17 or e17 for example would achieve this. you also could extend further down from your corner stone with d14. but then white could reduce your corner.]
;W[ec];B[ef]C[that's ok if you're aware of white will now take the corner and you are  trying to build up influence or territory towards the buttom.]
;W[dc];B[dh]C[i think it's better to play c16 by yourself. that will give your group a better base and not leave all the corner to white.]
;W[cd]C[this bending of white does great damage to your territory to the side.]
;B[cf]C[this one is quite good since honestly trying to save d16 by connecting would be no good since white could extend it's corner-territory.]
;W[be]
(;B[bg]C[i think it'd be best to leave this at it is and use the chance to tenuki, play elsewhere. white can do no real damage here (there are no good follow-up moves for him)  (see variation).]
;W[id];B[je];W[de];B[df];W[ed];B[pb];W[ob];B[oa]C[this is a endgame move. look for move that's worth more!]
;W[na]
(;B[pa]C[endgame, too (see variation for better way to play here).]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[gf]MA[cm][fq][cn][dn]C[better tenuki. perhaps play somewhere on the buttom left side to establish a wider base for this group.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[oe];B[pe];W[gi];B[hk]MA[el][dl][cn][cm]C[to create a secure territory on the left side it is better to play on e8 or somewhere near there.
since white is facing a solid wall towards the top he could only move downwards or to the right. play there to have a solid base for fighting.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pm]C[why not blocking directly to one side ( e4 / q3)? at least you should not give way easily.]
;W[qp]
(;B[qn]C[better on r5 (see variation).];W[pq];B[oq];W[or]C[this gets dangerous.]

(;B[pn]C[just connect on p4.];W[op];B[nq];W[pr];B[oo];W[pp]
;B[nn];W[cq];B[lp]C[overplay. play nearer to the left corner white just invaded. m4 is too close to b's own wall.  e.g. f3 would narrow the corner for white and fit well to the wall to the right.
again: don't let white take the corner so easily.
always think about which move is the most urgent one (in respect of points/territory and security).]
;W[dq];B[os]C[not necessary now. play in the left buttom corner. don't leave it to white without gaining something "equal" yourself (e.g. gaining wall on the outside while giving white little life in the inside (see example in variation earlier)).]
;W[cp];B[ns]C[absolutely endgame-move. leave these ones for later on in the game!]

;B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[kq]C[that kind of move should have been played much earlier!]

;W[en];B[fn];W[bi];B[eo];W[dn];B[gj]C[play elsewhere. it could be your territory you play in...]
;W[fi]C[white is just a computer ;-)];B[fh]C[where will white go? there is no way for him to escape and all the surrounding groups are connected.  better play elsewhere...]
;W[kd];B[ei]MA[jn][kl][ok][mh][lj][kh][qh][mm][hm][re][rc][oh]
[rj]C[elsewhere. the white group around f11 cannot live. better close top against possible white invasion.
b's  scetched (center-) territory seems rather big. b should try to make it secure now.  but notice: white also has big side and corner territories. try to invade them if you can.]

;W[md];B[nf];W[of];B[og];W[mi];B[pg];W[nk];B[lk];W[mj];B[mg]
C[bad shape. the idea now should be to not let white live inside b's territory by hindering him of making two eyes. doing this b should make secure moves. they don't have to be near white stones necessarily. "kill from the distance" i call this.]
;W[kh];B[li]C[by playing to close you give the opponent the opportunity to kill some of your stones and live.]

;W[he];B[ie];W[kk];B[kl]C[this hane is good since it stops white from walking further into the buttom.]
;W[ne];B[mh];W[jk];B[ii]C[leave this for later. if white'd play here you could play below or k12 to connect. so these two ways are "miai". you can take the other if one gets occupied by white.]
;W[im];B[jh]C[absolutely unnecessary. white is going to enclose b's two stones and probably will kill them and live.]

(;B[ni]C[it seems that white wouldn't have a chance to live if he couldn't kill. better to protect stones from beeing killed now than cutting off small groups.

always consider sequence (see variation for example).  watch out for sequences that are sente for your partner to keep inititaive for as long as possible.]
;W[oc];B[rj];W[sh];B[si]C[white is dead anyways. play elsewhere.]

;W[kp];B[mq];W[oj];B[ms];W[jm];B[tt];W[fb];B[tt]C[white wins this game.
he wins by establishing a center group which takes away black's territory.

one should not leave the corners to the partner easily since they are the parts on the board which bring  most points.

really leave endgame-moves to the endgame. endgame-moves are mostly moves on the first line which close territories and can be blocked easily or if partner captures further invasion can be hindered easily (example is given at the begining of this game).

if there are several possibilities for the next move always consider which one is the most important and which one are not important at all.]
