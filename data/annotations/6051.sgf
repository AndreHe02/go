C[B.: This is a game between two 5k players on KGS. I am HonFu, Bernd in real life.

I'd like to have this game commented for both sides, so that I can find out where I really played well and where my opponent just didn't make use of his opportunities.

There will be lots of comments to show you why I played moves, to make you able to correct wrong ideas. Please don't remove the comments, I want to see questions and answers together for better learning effect.

Of course, please do also comment things I haven't mentioned, just show me everything you see - I want to learn much more!

Thank you for reviewing this game! ^_^

D: Hello, my nick-name and real-name is Darek (1k). I beg to say that you had played very well so the game won't be easy to comment for me.]
;B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]C[B.: His move was in the direction of playing a kakari later. I like to immediately prevent this, since I still will be able to get a second corner.

D: I like this move too, it's just a question of style to play shimari immediately or taking a next corner.]
;W[qd];B[dd]C[B.: I played hoshi to make a kakari non-urgent and to prepare a kakari at the upper right corner. Correct strategy here?

D: Yes, correct :)];W[oc];B[qj]C[B.: Now I was not sure. They tell us: First kakari, then extensions along the sides. But since R10 was big for both sides I thought it was bigger. Correct?

D:  I would play the same move without consideration because it is more important looking for a direction of play than any kakari. It's very big move for both players.]
;W[cf];B[cj]C[B.: If I had played around F17, he would have got D10, so I decided to make thickness towards C10. It was the first time I used this pincer.

D: I agree, althought F17 would be possible too and then F3 after white D10.]
;W[bd]C[B.: Is this move correct? I was expecting F17, C17 or E14.

D: Strange move, white doesn't have good extension because of black C10 so playing F17 or C17 should be better.]

(;B[ce]C[D: I think this move is rather too vulgar, quiet answer at C17 or D14 might be better (variations).]
;W[be];B[df]
(;W[cd]C[D: Looks for aji-keshi move because it consolidates the black group on 4-th line and eliminates weakness in black's shape.]
;B[de];W[dc];B[ec];W[db]
(;B[eb];W[ed]C[D: Aji-keshi, white should wait for a better moment with this cutting, because maybe white D13 will be more important later.]
;B[fd];W[cg]
(;B[dg]C[D: Maybe little slowly, I would choose between M17, P10, K4 or C6.]
;W[jc]C[B.: I had to keep my stones connected and ended up with thickness to the right, which he just erased. Is this alright or did I do something wrong? I considered attacking with M17, but since he could have got at least a one space extension - more than me - and since his corner was strong, I decided to be patient and go on taking big points.

D: White's direction of play is OK but I'd say K17 is little too greedy, just M17 is OK (black is too strong and won't play K17 quickly). 
Black's invasion at M17 of course is possible but not immediately, R13 or K4 should be bigger.]
;B[fq]C[B.: This kakari seemed to be the most important one, threatening to make a double wing framework in the lower right.

D: Good move but K4 maybe little better? I'm not sure about this theory: there is shimari and nice extension at R10. Black's move at K4 makes very balanced and moyo creating 'double-wing' formation with one wing on 3-th line and second one on 4-th. Next logic white move would be at R12 but black's reply at P10 makes black's moyo really existing. Also black's continuation at F3 kakari would be strong.]
;W[iq]C[D: I like this princer here.];B[cn];W[eo];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[gp]C[B.: Since he pincered at J3, I took the corner. Alright?

D: It's normal];B[qg]C[B.: I wondered if I should play something like K15 to make a moyo in the center, or if I should approach the thick bottom group and make a double wing framework. Finally I chose R13, because then he can't make a double wing framework, and my thickness from the right - I hoped - would prevent the upper side from getting all too big.

D: K15 is too early, there don't have enough conditions to make moyo yet. R13 is big move.]
;W[ld]C[B.: Now he seemed to have been afraid of an invasion. Was M17 a good follow up move for me, now that I got R13 in place?

D: The first my thought was that actual move is too solid and slow, that white's Q9/R5 would be better, but after some consideration I agree that white's invasion at M17 might be troublesome for white now (with placed R13).]
;B[kq]C[B.: Now this seemed next important to me, although I still thought of K15. It wouldn't have had much territory potential, but I just didn't like my thickness going to waste, so I considered it.

D: I'd say K15 still too early. Maybe P10 instead of L3? Playing white I'd play next move at Q9 or try any combination beggining from R5.]
;W[lq]C[B.: This attachment puzzled me. Did I get too close? How should I react? I came out quite well, but maybe there are other variations?

D: I like the result of your continuation.];B[lp];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[jp];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[lo];B[mp];W[kr];B[ln]C[D: It's well done, don't see better sequence.]
;W[pl]C[B.: Seemingly he played a double purpose move - a ladder block which is an invasion at the same time. Since the two space extension above is stable and the corner also is safe, I thought, I should defend by attacking and turn his move into a thank you move.

D: Too deep move, P9 would be better.];B[ok]C[D: Good point to start the attack.]
;W[mo];B[km];W[ml];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[mm];B[mn];W[om];B[nn]
;W[mj];B[oi]C[B.: Here I had a feeling that my opponent helped me a lot getting good shape everywhere. Were there other variations which wouldn't have been so good for me?

D: Black has much better possition now. There is big black territory on the right and moreover white N8 group is floating. White's invasion at Q8 made the game easy for black. I rather don't see better continuation for black.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl]C[B.: So here he gave me secure territory. Isn't this a mistake? I can always reduce from L7, can't I? Or should I have let thrust him down and attack the center stones from N12? But I can't see a real chance to kill them and also no large territory or influence profits, so I just answered the forcing moves getting territory and let him guard his center group.

D: Yes, white playing D7 and D8 only helped to secure territory on the left side. Later white can try to play atari at K5 and then something about J7 but can't belive in many points since there is weak group N8 and cutting point F7.]
;W[mh]C[D: Solid decision.];B[je]C[B.: Since there were no other extensions, I took K15 finally, to counter his center influence and to stop the upper side from growing. In this phase of play I never know what is biggest. Should I have played the D2 sequence first? Or C12? S15? The latter ones are gote, but the former - was it bigger than K15?

D: I think that D2 would be very big now and it's almost sente, althought K15 makes good work in strategical sense and can't say which one is better.]
;W[hd]C[B.: The keima has a weakness, they say. But since I didn't see a way to exploit it, I stuck with my old plan and shut off the center.

D: See variation I would probably play.]
(;B[id];W[ic];B[he];W[jd];B[ie];W[mf]
(;B[ch]C[B.: But now really was the time for D2, wasn't it? Or should I have tried for territory in the center, maybe around K12? I thought that he could reduce then with E10, D11 or something, so I wasn't sure if the edge wasn't bigger.

D: C12 doesn't look for the biggest one (see my variations).]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[jh]C[B.: Now he took the center point and there really arent many points left for me.]
;B[dr]C[B.: Finally!

D: OK];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[fr]
(;B[bh]C[B.: Still - was H12 bigger?

D: See my variations after F2 move. The center looks for more important place.]
;W[hh]C[B.: And now - F12? Or something like J9?

D: Still like variation before, so the first one K5, try to finish in sente and capture C14/13. 
Other possibility: Not F12 but deeper at F9 looking at the cutting point E7 after b:D6, w:E6.]
;B[bf]C[D: OK];W[bb];B[re];W[rd];B[qe];W[pe];B[pf];W[oe];B[sd]
;W[ff]C[B.: Here my opponent requested a takeback. ^_Â° To me it looked threatening enough, but I came out alright. Was this a dangerous move?

D: I made variation to check was it dangerous move.]
(;B[gg]C[D: I'd capture E16 to leave less sente moves for white.]
;W[fh]
(;B[fg]C[D: Not necessary, see variation.];W[gh];B[hm]C[B.: If you take one point, you can't take the other one. Endgame really is still my weak point, so ... was S17 bigger?

D: Good direction but risky point, I'd play K5 insted of H7]

(;W[jo];B[kn];W[jl];B[in];W[jn];B[jm];W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[ls]
C[B.: Here I hoped for a tenuki, which unfortunately I didn't get. And the upper right is still open ... and maybe M9 would work too?

D: M9 induces bamboo O10 which would be unpleasent for black. 
Black can try to cut at E7 looking on H/J/K8.
Of course S17 also bigger than M1.];W[ks];B[ej]C[B.: While playing I thought reducing the center territory was most important. Now I'm not sure anymore.

D: OK, threatens D7/8];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj];B[ek];W[fl];B[el];W[em]
;B[le]C[D: Gote, better S17.];W[me];B[kd];W[kc];B[ke];W[hg]
;B[gf];W[qo]C[B.: This one surprised me! Living there? And almost he did ...

D: Living here is possible only after black's mistake, black is too strong around... But white is behind so many points that it's only one chance.]

;B[rr];W[pk];B[pj];W[pm];B[rl];W[oo];B[on];W[pn];B[po]C[B.: If you can show me other - better - variations in this life 'n death fight, please do! Please also add some principles that don't enter life and death problems - how to start attacking stones which are supposed to die?

D: I can say nothing more than everybody knows: play moves which destroy eye-shape. 
I oftener play on feeling than reading ... I know, it's rather bad, but I'm lazybones ;)

The game is over now, black is many points ahead. 
I'm sorry if I didn't answer to many your questions, but our ranks aren't so many different :)]

(;B[rp]C[D: I think that after this move instead of Q4 white doesn't have a room for eyes. The answer at Q4 lets to play eye-shape sente moves starting from S4 (how in the game).]

Instead of passive H12 black can play peep-moves at marked points and try to cut K12 stone (the black shape below would be helpful).]
