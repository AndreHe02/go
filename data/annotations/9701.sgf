C[This is my game against stronger player from Confucius Cup in Dublin.

BB: I'm an Australian 2d, but I haven't played in a while. I hope you find this review useful, with some food for thought. If not, please let me know and I will either request a review of this review, or stop reviewing for the GTL.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[nc];W[pf];B[jd]C[BB: o17 naturally is against the direction of play, because the top left corner is more resolved from the perspective of the top, and more unresolved from the left side. k16 leaves an obvious weakness between it and o17, and it doesn't really connect to d17 either. Black is very much encouraging you now to invade the top left.]
;W[de]C[BB: This is my natural inclination. Your stones so far are light, being all on the fourth line, so you do not need to defend them as such. To play elsewhere and let Black play d15 would be devastating.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df]C[BB: I'm no joseki expert, but this seems heavy. This is not light shape. I can only guess that your intention is to play whichever side Black does not. As it turns out, black plays a resolving move at the top (low, at f17), and allows you to settle the left. Black gets the top, but weakness remains, and you get a small position on the left with potential for expansion. It is a decent result for you, but I wonder if Black had attacked at the left, if you could have settled so easily - or even at all.]
;B[fc];W[cj]C[BB: d10 is better. This is too far away to give you sure life. In fact, I think d11 would be better, giving you strength and influence.]
;B[cl]C[BB: Yes, Black has little to worry about here, and can put direct pressure on you.]
;W[jq]C[BB: Urgent moves before big moves. The left is not settled. k3 is a territorial move - especially being on line 3, the line of territory, rather than k4, the line of influence. K4 would be better, but still wrong. E10 is correct. You should ask yourself, what was the motivation for this move? Did you think it was just about territory, about winning the game by having more points at the end? Or did you think that the left side was out of danger?]
;B[ch]C[BB: This is the correct attack here.];W[di];B[dh];W[eh]
;B[bh];W[bf];B[bj];W[bk];B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[fh];B[dj];W[bi]
;B[ck]C[After this terrible sequence I tried really hard to recover and took a lead for some time, but I lost anyway. How could I do better?

BB: Your comment at the end says that Black won by 3.5 points. It also says that in the endgame, you accidentally let him play two moves in a row, which would have been worth more than 3.5 points. It sounds like you do not need my advice on how to win this game, apart from what you already knew which is that the problem on the left side should not have been allowed to happen. Evidently, you played better than Black from here on. Still I will continue to review the game, in perhaps some less detail.]
;W[gf]C[BB: I would actually take the forcing move of f11 first, lest Black take it in sente.]
;B[gd];W[ld];B[lc];W[mc];B[md];W[kc];B[lb];W[me];B[nd];W[kd]
;B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[ng]C[BB: To what end do you play this move? Do you expect to enclose in sente, or kill? It obviously creates weakness. Why not just n13?]
;B[mg]C[BB: Black takes the direct approach. He risks little while you risk miuch.]
;W[og];B[le];W[je];B[lf];W[id];B[hc];W[he]C[BB: Well, you have life in gote. It will be interesting to see how you come so close to winning this game.]
;B[nh];W[mh]C[BB: This does not make sense. Why not simply q11?]
;B[ni];W[pi];B[lh]C[BB: This is a small move.];W[fp];B[mi]C[BB: This is a small move. Why does black care so much about those two stones? In the end, your n12 became a very efficient sacrifice!]
;W[bn]C[BB: I don't understand this. Do you desperately hope to kill d4? Why not take the corner with c3?]
;B[cn];W[cq];B[cp]C[BB: Now I wonder, in your desperation, perhaps b4 is more consistent. Let's take a look.]

(;W[dq];B[qq];W[pq]C[BB: This is the right direction. I think Black's invasion is premature.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq]
;B[kp]C[BB: Black says "I will win. You will have insufficient territory." But I think this is not so big. Black has two areas of influence facing this would-be moyo. q18 is big, and I think you could play there now. b4 is also big. I think k4 is probably the best reply.]
;W[kq]C[BB: If you were ahead, this might be reasonable.];B[lp]
;W[jn]C[BB: You ask Black to play m6.];B[lm]C[BB: He goes one further. Why not take the challenge and play m6 here? Let's take a look.]

(;W[pb];B[ob];W[bp];B[bo];W[ao];B[co];W[bq];B[bm]C[BB: Nice of him to let you have this in sente.]
;W[mn];B[ln]C[BB: Again, a defensive play. You should have played m6. How can you win now?]
;W[fm]C[BB: Did you think you'd get territory? Or threaten Black? Black should respond with k4, I think.]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[eq];W[er];B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[fn];B[eo];W[ho]
;B[hn];W[in];B[gl]C[BB: Black lost the ability to play k4 in sente.]

(;W[kl]C[BB: There is a more interesting variation.];B[ml];W[gm]
C[BB: But this works too.];B[jp];W[lq]C[BB: I like this. I think I'd have played j3, but this is interesting.]
;B[hp];W[hm];B[gp];W[gr];B[gq];W[fr];B[iq];W[mk]C[BB: Finally, you attack :)]
;B[nk];W[nl]C[BB: Perhaps m9 instead.];B[lk];W[ej]C[BB: This is not a good move at all.]
;B[ci];W[fj];B[fg];W[gh];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[rk];B[pl]C[BB: Oddly, Black waited until this area was settled before trying this.]

;W[ke];B[kb];W[ic];B[jb];W[tt]C[Strange thing happened here. Black went into add-time. It was canadian and we had an analog clock, so it needed to count the stones and manually set the clock. In the fuss I let my opponent play twice (!). Eventually Black won by 3.5 points.

BB: Black letting you kill r8 was big. As was letting you get territory in the middle. You played the endgame better, I think. In summary, if there is a lesson to be learned here, it is that you need to work on fuseki: the direction of play, and the importance of strong and weak groups.]
