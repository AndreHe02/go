[ic];B[no]C[This move seems too small. F3 is more interesting (splitting the lower side)]
;W[lp]C[After this move, F3 is more difficult to play];B[cn];W[dn];B[dm]
;W[co];B[en];W[do]
(;B[cm]C[Better at B, to allow some lower side invasion, and to avoid some overconcentration]
;W[fp]C[B seems to be already behind. He is overconcentrated on the left side and has an awkward form on the right side]

(;B[ne]C[This move is weak. b should fight at M16 (see diagram) or expand its moyo at M15]

(;B[lg]C[A is too weak. Black is strong in this area, he should no be afraid on the cut. K13 is very important for both players]

(;B[ji]C[B should play J11 here.];W[jn]
(;B[km]C[Better to cut at J13, the right side territory is not big enough to match w if B let w play E13]
;W[eg];B[dh]C[even if B was winning, D12 is a bad move, as it helps w to strengthen itself more than it strengthens B]
;W[eh];B[ii]C[Same comment for this move];W[hh];B[gn];W[ho]C[B has something like 80 pts on the right side + 10pts on the left
W has 60+ pts on the upper side + more than 30 on the lower
so B is losing

If B wants to win, he should try something in the upper left corner, like D17 or C17 or even B16]

(;B[kl]C[Why answer L8 and not K8 ? In fact, why answer at all ? if WL8, b M8 and this remains smaller than playing in the upper left corner]
