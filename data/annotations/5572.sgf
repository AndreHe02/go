C[Well this a party I played against gnugo level 10 with the
software dariush. I lost by more than 50 points.
The fact is I don't understand where are the points I must
look at, I need someone to help.];B[dp];W[pd];B[po]CR[pp][qp]
[pq]C[This is quite a high opening play.  It is legitimate, but not necessarily recommended for beginners.  The marked squares are more typical.  If you just want to be different from the other beginners out there, make sure you know the common responses and how to deal with them.]
;W[cd]
(;B[qq]TR[po][qo]SQ[pq]C[This stone doesn't make sense.  In go, one of the most desireable shapes to have early on is a "corner enclosure" based on the 3-4 point (marked with square).  The two most common corner enclosures have stones on the square and either of the triangles.  If you had played R3 at Q3 instead you would have a more desireable shape.]
;W[dh]CR[fc][id]C[This move from white threatens a lot of gain on the top.  You almost have to respond somewhere there.  I might consider the marked points.]
;B[dj];W[fp]SQ[dn]C[The traditional response to this move is marked.  Your followup seems valid to me though.]
;B[cn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr];W[jq];B[pi]TR[fc][id]C[I would have taken sente to play in here.]
;W[ed]C[Now he has it locked up and playing in there becomes more uncomfortable for you.]
;B[nd];W[pf];B[pc];W[qc];B[oc];W[qb];B[jd]C[This sequence is good, but W still has a significant gain on the top left.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[ib]TR[ob]SQ[mp]C[This move is unecessary.  W doesn't have as much of a threat on that side of your shape as on the other side.  In any case, that's a late-game move.  Right now there are still plenty of 3rd and 4th line spots left.  The marked square deserves attention.]
;W[mq];B[pl]C[Almost arrive, I thought that the game is equal.

It is close, you may even be ahead.];W[qh];B[qi];W[rh];B[ri]
;W[na];B[pb]C[This is very disturbing for me, I don't know how to
respond.

The move he made is called a "monkey jump."  It is annoying, and the response depends on what stones you have in the area.  In the end it's worth around 9 points.  Your response is legitimate.]
;W[pa];B[nb];W[oa];B[ma];W[ci];B[cj];W[dr];B[ob];W[fn]SQ[mn]
C[The W response here illustrates an important point.  You only make a few points by taking the stones below.  W can potentially make a lot more with his move.

You should respond to this W move before taking those stones.  If W plays in the marked area he makes *big* points.  However, if you play there you threaten another move near N11.  This is actually a good opportunity for you to pick up some points.]
;B[qa];W[od];B[el]SQ[mo]C[This doesn't make you as much as the marked point.

It can be hard to see moves like this.  Something I try to look for when I'm playing are areas on the board where both players can effectively expand their moyo.  The marked point is a perfect example.  W can play there for big moyo and so can you.  E8 is not such a point, it would not really add to W's moyo in an effective way.  It's not a very good extension for you either.

When looking to build effective moyo, it can be helpful to look for places where you can take a base and extend it up into a square.  W F6 gives him 3 corners of a square, a move around the marked point completing that square.  That's worth a lot of points.  If you play there, you have 3 corners of a square, with a move near N11 completing it.  That basically forces white to play around N11 to keep you from making that nice moyo.]
;W[mn]C[W takes it, huge gain for him.];B[ml]C[See how nicely this would have been if you had the stone around N6?]
;W[ne];B[jn]C[I played this stone to prevent white from getting to the
center, and restrict his moyo.

This move is aggressive.  However, you do pretty much have to restrict that moyo.  Better not to let him get the moyo in the first place so you aren't forced to play aggressively.  You'd much rather have that N6 stone than your E8 stone now.]
;W[io];B[in];W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[mf];B[jg]SQ[mi]C[This was probably a bad idea but to be true, I did'nt know
exactly where to play.

If I played in that part of the board, it would have been near the marked point.  It completes a box of moyo for you and takes away that option for W.  However, I would probably have played on the bottom first and tried to get away in sente.]
;W[gg];B[gi]SQ[mi][lp]C[This move seems passive to me.  You're letting W lead you.  That area is largely undecided, no reason to play there.  The marked points offer alternatives, especially on the bottom.]
;W[mh]C[This is a point you would like to have had.];B[mi]C[Contact here is debatable, I probably wouldn't have done it.  If you want to contact, perhaps O12 is the place to do it.]
;W[lm];B[kk]TR[hh][lh][gl][kl][gm]C[I wanted to make the center mine.

This move doesn't really make the center yours.  W still has a lot of places to invade (marked).  In combination, those will limit you to few points in the middle.  The move you made only really gives you a few points in the area of M9.  Better would have been to try to move in on W's considerable territory near M4.]
;W[or]C[You'll notice it's awkward for you to play in this area.  If your R3 stone had been at Q3 it would be more natural.  This ties to the comments I made early on about that choice.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[nq];W[nr]C[This was played to restrict moyo.]
;B[op]SQ[lo]C[This is a lost move, those 2 stones weren't in danger.  Much better to play this near the marked point!]
;W[hb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[fl]TR[gb]C[W leaves you an opening at G18 here.  It may be wise not to take it now, but keep it in reserve.]
;B[nn]SQ[lo]C[Marked point looks better.  Always look for weak points inside your opponent's structure.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[dn];B[cl];W[ek];B[dl];W[gk]TR[fj][gm][eo]C[W's so-called "trumpet structure" here has weak points for you to exploit.  The marked spots can make W respond to protect.]
;B[do];W[ho];B[km]TR[gb][rb][sh][bi][lo]C[This move seems like it's trying to make territory that doesn't really exist.  You won't get anything in the J8 area.  The marked points here are much bigger.]
;W[gb];B[kp]C[Finally something here ^_^.];W[kq];B[jo]TR[sh]
[bi]C[This move is not sente, no reason to make it at this point.  The marked points are much bigger.]
;W[si];B[sj];W[sh];B[rj];W[ra];B[pa];W[en];B[co]C[This stone is wasted.  W cannot hurt you there.]
;W[rs]C[Another one which I don't know how to respond.]
(;B[rq]C[Wrong way!  This is another monkey jump from W, try to cut it off.  I show the best way in a variation.]
;W[eh];B[bi]C[Finally ^_^!];W[bh];B[bk]C[Oops, that's worse than just B10 because W can atari.]
;W[jp];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko];W[ll];B[lk];W[hn];B[kl]C[Again, making territory that doesn't exist.]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[im];B[ii]C[More territory that is tenuous at best.]
;W[ai];B[fj];W[ej];B[hh]SQ[hf]C[This stone is not particularly well directed.  What is its purpose?  If you want territory, get out of the middle.  If you want to reduce W, play nearer to his territory.  Perhaps the marked point.]
;W[bj];B[ak];W[lh];B[li];W[kh];B[jh];W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[og]
;W[rb];B[pg]C[This move makes the last one look very unecessary.  One of those should have gone somewhere else.]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[rg];B[of];W[oe];B[ng];W[cs]SQ[of][ng][og][pg]
[qg][oh]C[The marked structure is very think and didn't really get anywhere.  It also lost you sente.  Always look to keep sente.  Is responding to your move worth more than playing elsewhere?  If not, don't make that move.]
;B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[nj];B[nk];W[ki];B[lj];W[jj];B[jf]C[This stone gets you essentially no territory and doesn't reduce W.  Each stone needs a purpose, this one is just an extension of the other stones with no added purpose.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[dk];B[ck];W[fi];B[gj];W[fk];B[mk]
C[This is a wasted move.];W[gh]
(;B[hi]SQ[hk]C[As is this.  It could have been at the marked point.]
;W[hk];B[jm]C[Another wasted move.];W[il];B[jk];W[kd]C[This is much bigger than the previous moves.]
;B[kc];W[aj]
(;B[je]C[Again, what is the purpose of this stone??  The other stones in the vicinity were already serving that function.  There is no way W could cut that, see variation.]
;W[nc];B[lq]C[This is better.];W[lr];B[ln]C[Oops, put yourself in atari.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[mr]C[Turns out okay.];B[ik];W[mg];B[lf];W[rr]

(;B[sq]C[Play to cut off those W stones.  They aren't a threat to your territory if they can be cut off.  After that, worry about your territory.  See variation.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[pq];B[pp];W[oq];B[qp]C[Wasted stone.  Don't defend until you read out whether you need to.]

C[That move actually gives away a point.  There was no threat there.]
;W[kn];B[ie]C[That move gives away a point too!!];W[ln];B[me]

[dp][cq][qq][cr]C[At the end W was playing as if the rules were Chinese.

Okay, let's analyze.  I want you to compare the final board to what you see after move 29.  That's where the beginning of the game begins to give way to the middle.  I've marked all the stones that were on the board after move 29 (B is square, W is triangle).

Let's look at B first.  It looks like your biggest gain after move 29 was around P6.  Everything else was territory you pretty much had.  Your biggest loss was in the area of N16.  You were hoping to make territory there.  However, critiquing harshly here, it looks like after move 29 you had a net *loss* of points.  This does not bode well for your outcome ^_^

Looking at W, his biggest gains were in the area of G7, Q1 and F13.  There aren't any major losses, but perhaps W would have liked a little more around R13.

Notice though, that the game hasn't changed much since move 29.  The ONLY MOVES that got either player points were directly on top of the territory they already had.  Nothing in the center.  The player that made the most points above his territory won.  Now, I want you to look back when I was talking about the moves around N6 and how you needed to take that first.  This is why.  Fighting for the center is futile.  Fighting to make your base into a box-shaped moyo is really what you want to be doing.  That is what makes the points around N5 and N6 so huge.  Whoever gets it first makes the bigger box.

If you look at W's stones in the top left you'll see that he successfully created a box there too out of the E16, C16, and D12 stones.  That's worth a ton.

Now, compare this to the several moves you made in the center where I said that you were trying to make territory that didn't exist.  Notice that, in fact, there is no territory in the center.  This will help you learn where to try for territory and where not to (in short, the lower you are the more likely to make territory).


Let's talk briefly about the end game.  You need to do a lot of work here.  The first thing you need is a better understanding of the rules.  Any time you play in your own territory, whether it's Japanese or Chinese rules, you lose a point (the reason in Chinese takes a little more thought, but it's true).  So go back to each move where I angrily said that you lost yourself a point and figure out why.  Be sure in each case.  Then don't do it again!  Because it doesn't just lose you that point.  It loses you that point plus whatever points you could have gained with that stone.  In the end, doing that 4 or 5 times is just devastating.  Play your endgame very slowly.  Count how many points each move is worth.  Don't make a move just because it forces your opponent to respond if it's worth no points.  Make only moves that you know will give you points (or remove points from your opponent) because you played out the moves first in your head.


Finally, a more advanced topic but one that you need to start thinking about is stone efficiency and purpose.  You played a number if stones whose purpose was quite unclear, especially your extensions around K14.  Every single stone you play needs to have a purpose, preferrably two or more purposes.  Just extending stones that are already quite heavy is redundant.  Make sure that you aren't giving two stones the same job.  This can be harder to see in practice, but if you look at the moves I was critical of you can probably start to figure out which ones look like they are redundant.


If you have questions or don't understand anything I've said here, please write me back.  I don't want an important point to go missed because I wrote it poorly.  In the end the biggest issues were trying to make territory in the center instead of on top of your own bases and wasting stones on nothing moves or in fact on negative moves.  Good luck improving your game.  I hope you have found my comments helpful.
