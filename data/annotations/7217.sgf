;B[pd]C[I, BlackEagle, had the black stones in this game.  I ended up winning by 4.5 points but only because my opponent made a mistake.  (See move 226.)  I think that, in addition to tactical errors, my setup going into the middle game was not good.  I've looked over this game myself and left comments so you can see what I was thinking on some of the moves.  Any suggestions you have for how I can improve would be great.

Thanks!

Hi, i'm Fnor and i will comment this game. I'll mark my comments by a "F".
I you still have some questions after this review or if you don't understand what I want to say (sorry for mistakes, i'm not english-speaking), you can contact me on KGS.

Good review,
Fnor];W[qp];B[cd];W[ec];B[dq]TR[pc]C[I figured it would probably be better to take the empty corner and worry about white's approach move later.  I need to learn a bit more about this style of opening.

F : This way of playing is possible because black need no immediate answer to protect C16.
This opening also looks like the shusaku's opening (but the Q16 stone would be at Q17).]

(;W[co];B[cm]C[Not a move I typically make, but I was feeling a little adventurous and thought I'd try a pincer play for a change.]
;W[df];B[de];W[ee];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ep]TR[dh]C[I don't think I replied well to this.  The sequence that ensues is not great.

F : White should continue with D12, B D12, at least.
Later, black playing at D12 would be painful for white (see variation).]

(;B[do]LB[dp:A][eq:B]C[D5 isn't joseki, black has 2 possibilities : A or B.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[eq]
(;B[bq];W[dr]C[I end up with some side territory in exchange for some of the corner.  Maybe it isn't too bad?]
;B[jc]C[Since the ladder white can start in the LL corner by playing at D2 is broken by my stone on Q16, I decide to extend along a side.  I chose to extend along the upper side in an effort to limit the effect of white's wall in the UL corner.

F : White doesn't need to capture : if his stone can escape, this is a good result for him. Protect at D6 would be better than K17.

Looking at the board at this point, I think that an invasion at K4 or L4 is probably necessary sometime in the future, but in this game, I miss my chance.

F : The best point for an invasion is L3. Then white will push you on his stones in the LL corner. A kakari at P3 or P4 is also possible.]

(;W[je];B[ld];W[hd];B[qj];W[qf]C[I don't think I responded correctly to this move.  The next sequence puts my stone on R10 in big trouble.]

(;B[rd]C[I secure the corner, but...

F : This is too passive.];W[nf];B[nd]C[This];W[me]C[...white plays a sequence of forcing moves...]
;B[md];W[eo];B[dn]C[(Actually, I think white could have done better with the ladder here.  It's no longer broken!)]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[cc];B[bc];W[qm]C[... and now my stone on R10 is very, very lonely and under attack.]
;B[oj]C[I begin to draw my stone out into the center, but white keeps up the attack making territory in the process.

I'm ahead at the moment in terms of points, but white's stones are much better developed.  In fact, white almost rings the center!]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[qh];B[rl];W[ql]
(;B[qk];W[rm]
(;B[rk];W[nq];B[nl];W[nn];B[jp]C[Thinking my side group was safe for now, I try to reduce the growing white framework on the bottom before it's too late, but this attack is not well timed.  I think it should have been earlier, but when?

F : Right side isn't safe and creating two weak group isn't a good idea.]
;W[jn]C[White tries to shut me in.  Actually, I think this probably should have succeeded, but I'm not sure.  The next sequence of moves is me struggling to either find a way to connect to the black group on the right side or to live on the bottom.

F : I think white can't kill black because there is too much place, but K6 is also a stone that prepare the attack of R9 (which actually have no eye).]
;B[lq];W[iq];B[mr];W[nr];B[ip];W[hp];B[jq];W[ir];B[mn]C[F: White doesn't let connect : with two weak groups, white could probably kill one of a part of the two.]

;W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj]
(;W[ol];B[lj]C[I lose one stone, but now my groups are connected.  On the other hand, white has rapidly made up some of the difference in territory with a large LR corner, worth around 30 points!]
;W[hn];B[ij];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[kj];W[mi];B[mj];W[li]TR[dh]
[oh][ii]SQ[gh]C[Now, white starts to build up a good-sized center territory, too, and I don't think there's a whole lot I can do about it.

F : This territory isn't safe at the moment, black have many possibilities to reduce it.
The best one is D12 because it reduces white's territory and enlarge black's (this count double).]

(;B[fm];W[fn];B[gm];W[gn]C[F : This sequence only helps white to close hise territory.]

(;B[gi]C[F : Still in D12.];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[cj];W[dl];B[ck]
;W[dk];B[gg]C[I attempt to reduce some of the white center.]

(;B[hh]LB[cb:2][of:D][rf:4][hh:A][oh:1][cl:B][im:C][sm:6][cr:3]
[ns:5]TR[sg]C[I think this is bad.  I should have let this stone go because there are bigger moves elsewhere.  For examples, see the variations.

F : Well, this move is bad, but there are bigger moves than the marked ones.

A : 2 points, this is very small yose.
B : Gote move for 1 point.
C : You need 2 or 3 others moves to make some points in the center.
D : P15 cut the black stone.

Some big moves :
1) See variation move 88.
2 & 3) Sente moves in the corner.
4) Better than the monkey jump at T13.
5) Small moves, but sente (and big moves if white doesn't answer).]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[fj];B[hl];W[jl];B[il]C[I played this move to try and ensure that my large group of black stones was connected out.  If he then played E7, splitting them off, my plan would have been to play at L8, making an eye in the center, and then fighting to get an eye on either the left edge or the bottom edge.

F : You don't need a center eye, you can easily make two eyes on the sides.]

(;B[rh]LB[rh:A][ri:B]C[I'm pretty sure this move was no good, given what follows.  If I remember correctly, though, I was in time trouble here and was rushing to find a move somewhere.

F : S14 is better, see variation move 111.];W[ri];B[si];W[rg]
;B[qi];W[sh];B[sj];W[ph];B[em]C[At this point, I decided to play here and prevent the center group from being split off.  With my potential eyes at the edges and the center gone, I needed to do something about the threat of L9.  Maybe this move was long overdue?]
;W[io];B[oi]C[At this point, I though I was behind, but I wasn't quite sure by how much.  I estimate  the score as:

Black has...
-Around 30 points in the UR corner.
-Around 30 points on the left side.

Total of about 60 points.

White has...
-Around 30 points in the LR corner.
-Around 20 points on the lower side.
-Around 15-20 points in the center.
-6.5 points komi.

Total of about 70-75 points.

I'm behind by roughly 10-15 points, not counting prisoners and dead stones.

The game is closer than I expected, but I knew making up that difference was going to be very tough.  I started to try by reducing white's center territory.]

After trying all the variations on the next move, I don't see a way for the center stones to live unless I connect above here.]
