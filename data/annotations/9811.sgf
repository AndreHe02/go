;B[pp]C[Shinuslaw: hey
Shinuslaw: lets have a good game!


Hi!
My Name is Soeren and I'm a ~15kyu from Germany.
This game was played on ogs


I think my biggest weakness is my middle game ( but of course every part needs a lot of help). I mess up attacks quite a lot and I never see a good opportunity to attack.
In mot of my games my opponents get a really big moyo cause I play "territorial".

Hi my name is Hedin and i will do a review for you.];W[dd];B[pd]
C[blarbly: agreed!];W[dq]C[This is my "standard" opening. I start most of my games with 4-4 and a 3-4

H: The opening is ok. It is balanced but i'd not to play one opening in all my games, try different things.]
;B[cj]LB[pj:B][co:A]C[A gift
I'd prefer attacking the coner A or san-ren-sei B];W[nq]LB[co:A]
C[Is there anything worng with this move? In hindsight it looks like it doesn't work good with my D3 stone Maybe i should've approached the upper right or take another approach

H: As i think black had to attack coner, so i thinkwhite have to take simary A.
D3 is low and attacking the coner will not work with it good. But simari is powerfull position you may use indirectly with your O3]
;B[qn];W[jp]C[I thought that this move works better with my framework than the "normal" Joseki that I learned (slide under)]
;B[pj]
(;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[kc]LB[pr:A]C[It is joseki so it is not clearly bad but ...
after the joseki black has a solid right side about up to 80 points worth if he manages to take A.
White position have less and open. Bad exchange for white.]
;B[cm];W[co]C[Don't know if this was right. Maybe I should've played on the more open upper or left side.
Shimaris are always good was my thought

H: Ya finaly the idea came to you. Blackwas so kind, he insists you play simari]
;B[dg];W[gc]LB[fd:B][gd:A]C[You areto low on right side, i'd try high stone]
;B[ep]
(;W[eq]C[19 and 20 are to soft. 
Black is pushing while low, and white just accepts it.
White have to fight someway here.];B[do];W[dp];B[dn]
(;W[ql]C[this was IMO my first big messup. I did this yesterday, too when I played a 4kyu at my Go Club.

H: yes it is vary aggressive, butsometimes to be so aggressive is your only chance]
;B[pm];W[pl]C[Invading low you are going to settle down there you invade.]
;B[ol]
(;W[ok]C[maybe cut directly to gain something?];B[pk];W[om]
C[but here this cut doesn't seem to work];B[nl];W[oj];B[oi]

(;W[mj]C[Strange plays from my side. IMO. Tihs isn't accomplishing anything. He can just capture the 2 stones]
;B[nj];W[nm];B[ml];W[mm]LB[no:A]C[Here I wanted to build my lower side and was happy to push. But maybe he got too much here?

H: I do not see how are you going to manage black A so i do not think you did alow for lower side.]
;B[no]C[Ya black is smart now :-)];W[mo]C[maybe too passive?]
;B[lm];W[ln];B[on];W[mn];B[km];W[kn];B[gp]
(;W[gq]C[again. too passive? Or should I've played E4 early to prevent this? THought about that

H: Low and bad yes, but i do not think you really have a choise now.]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[hp];B[fo];W[qq]C[here it seemd that the corner is really big but I don't know what happens if he bloocks at Q3.]

(;B[qp]C[Luckily he didn't

H: yah vary soft for black. On the other hand he is leading something like 40 points it makessence for black to be solid.]
;W[pq];B[ee]LB[ee:A][pe:B][oi:C][cm:E][fo:D]C[I didn't understand this move at first. He gave me 4th line teritory

H: Black is building A-E area as his territory normaly it does not work, unless some gready opponent just grabs few more points of "4th line teritory"]

(;W[ed]C[come on ... too slow.]
(;B[jj]LB[id:A][ke:B]C[Strange for black i'd try to preasure at A or just build up B]

(;W[ce]LB[ad:3][bd:4][cd:5][ae:2][be:1][bg:A]C[I thought that was quite big. Maybe should've played something in the middle? (like I said my opponents always get big Moyos. I think I don't value the middle high enough)

H: just calculate how "big" is it. As you can see in variations it is really big it worth about 12 points and have continuation A for more. But...
It is big gote endgame move notto be played in midle game while you have something sente.]
;B[cf]
(;W[kf]LB[gf:A]C[and now I tried to jump (maybe one space would be safer?)

H: One space is a safe surrender. 
But jumping like this you let black make left side of moio sronger in sente
So i'd first push at A there black is relativly strong, but anyway will have to defent and when continue pushing to center.]

(;B[jd];W[jc]C[wanted to protect my side];B[id];W[kd]C[to connect]
;B[jf];W[je]C[I think that this move givs me a good cut if my opponnent doesn't respond]
;B[ie];W[ke];B[kg]C[I think this was an overplay on his part

H: Not sure, thismight be a notbad sacrifice.];W[jg]C[and here I try to cut]
;B[if]
(;W[jh];B[lg];W[hh]C[trying to get more liberties

H: A vary risky fight, but it mightbe right incase it is only chance forvictory you see.]
;B[gi];W[hg]C[maybe this was too slow. I make a bamboo joint, but I should've attacked more?

H: this bamboo is good for cloe fights but ... what is your plan? doesit fit your plan?]

(;B[gf]C[This is mistake by black but it is complicated case.]
;W[hf]C[and now I want to cut];B[he];W[ge]C[this cut seemed to work. I think black messed up with the one point jump]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[fd];W[ff];B[gg];W[ef];B[fc];W[hc];B[hd]
(;W[fb]C[is this necessary to kill?

H: See variation. But even if not, the move is better to do when gampling all your success here.]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh]C[this seems small now. Just 4 points. But that is a common DDK mistake (I think)]
;B[eb];W[gb];B[ec];W[dc]C[He tries to live there but I don't think that it's possibble]
;B[ba]C[didn't unterstand that moe Maybe should've ignored it?]
;W[db];B[da];W[cb];B[ca];W[bb];B[fa];W[ic]C[I was really afriad of the cut.]

;B[mf];W[qb]LB[ki:B][go:A]C[seems big now

H: not bigest. I'd consider something around A or B first. Both must be sente and this mightbe ignored.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[oc]C[thi seems like a really small move.. Should've left it open, right?

H: Definitly free sente for black]
(;B[rk];W[bn];B[bm];W[ki];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[kj]C[this was big, I think. I can connect my "lost" stone

H: yah black has to takeit first.];B[kk];W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[mi]
;W[li];B[nk];W[lj];B[lh];W[jk]C[I saw that this cut didn't work later. (at least not how I played

H: actualy it is NOT "didn't work" it made H6 later more dangerous fr black and you do not lose much here]
;B[kl]

C[blarbly: good game!
Shinuslaw: yeah
Shinuslaw: thank ou!

H: Your main issue is sente. Remember, it is vary big all the time in game unless it is the very final stage. Look for sente moves before big. Look for opportunities to take sente maybe sacrificing something not too imortant.]
