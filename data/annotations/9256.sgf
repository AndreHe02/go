C[Josh:  Hi, I'm Josh, I'll be commenting on your game.  My main handle for playing Go online is Kashomon and I'm currently 1d on KGS.]

;B[oq];W[qj];B[qg];W[lc]LB[ic:B][jc:C][kc:D][ql:A]C[Not sure what to do at this point, I am worried about f17 stones, so I made a base for them, but with hindsight maybe it would have been better to o17?

Josh:  You those the right direction, but you played a little passively.  You played at B, but you had the opportunity to play at C, which is perfect shape.  For that reason, White's move was misplaced -- it should have been played at D.

By the way, this is seems early for white to play this way.  If white ends up with gote, then you get to play A, which is perfect.]

(;B[ic];W[pb]
(;B[nc]LB[pc:A][qc:B]TR[qj]C[Josh  I don't think this is right.  The usual move would be at A.  It's very hard to make this move work for you.  Playing at B is also sufficient (and simple).  You still get sente to attack the marked stone.]
;W[nb];B[mb]
(;W[oc]LB[mc:B][nd:A]C[Josh: This was a mistake by white. In the game, you played A.  B is a much better move than what happened in the game -- Then, It's white that's being split]

(;B[nd]LB[od:A]C[Josh: A smaller mistake.  Should be at A if you want to play this way.  White didn't take advantage of it, but white can push one more time at A.]

(;W[mc]C[I wanted to seal him in at this point, but that failed.]
;B[od];W[qm]LB[nc:A][nd:B]C[I feel like letting him get r7 was a big mistake.

Josh: Yes, the mistake that lead to this was probably A (or perhaps B).]

;B[fp];W[fo];B[eq]C[not sure about the correct move at this point...

Josh: This is fine.];W[gp]LB[go:A]C[Josh: A side note: the usual move here for white is at A.  There are two cutting points right now, which is dangerous.]
;B[cm]LB[eo:A][go:B]C[now i go into crazy invasion mode, I do not like my postion, so i feel like I need to pull of something big.

Josh: This is a little deep, but seems possible, especially because white has A and B to worry about]
;W[dn]
(;B[cn]C[Josh: This doesn't do much for you -- it's basically a pass.]
;W[bp]TR[fp][cq][dq][eq][fq]C[Josh: This is a very painful move for you.  The bottom stones are nearly dead.]
;B[bj]
(;W[ch];B[dl];W[lq];B[om]LB[bq:A]TR[qg][qp]SQ[go][ho][hp]C[not sure if this was a good idea, maybe q7 would have been better?

Josh: This feels a bit slack because the moves on either side are two spaces away. I would use this opportunity to defend at A.  It's hard to attack white's stones on the outside since an extra move (squares) for white mean that the black stones on the bottom are dead.]

Josh: n5 would have probably been better.  The stones on the left are flexible.]
;B[bo]
(;W[nn]LB[mn:A]C[Josh: White should have played this as a loose ladder at A.]

(;B[mi]LB[ld:C][le:A][oi:B][pi:D]C[I think this would have been better at m15?

Josh: It's hard to make points in the center.  You can't just play simple moves, since the top and the right side are miai.  If you play m15 (A), white will play at B.  I would try something like C to seal off the top in Sente and then play at D.]

;W[mk];B[ll];W[mj]C[this was dissapointing because I wanted to keep pressure on m15 group as I knew I could deny the eye at p19...

Josh: This group is totally safe.  P19 is gote and the white group has space to run.]

(;B[kr]LB[eb:B][ag:A]C[Josh: This was a big mistake.  It's unnecessary -- you have enough liberties, so you're essentially filling in dame. The game is reasonably close, so you can get some significant points with A and B.]
