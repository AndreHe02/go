C[Hi,

my partner in this game suggested that I (Black) have a look at my play in yose, especially to recognize when o-yose begins. Please give me some hints here, general comments are also welcome, of course.

Thank you!

Hello

I'll be your reviewer for this game. I'll try to give you as many advice as I can, although yose is not my best point. Yose is only calculating the biggest move to play so I invite you to take a look at some book that will train you to count correctly.

All my note will be mark [cb22\]

Have fun !];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp]C[[cb22\] quite strange opening. You're going on 4-4 which is mostly made for influence (and to develop center) so Q4 maybe slightly better for this (and go for the san rei sen opening if you like to play influential game)]

[ph][pi][pj][pk][pl][pm][pn][po][gq][hq][iq][jq][kq][lq][mq]
[oq]C[[cb22\] not the best. Most of the time you want to play on the most open side. Count between 2 stones and choose the biggest one. Here you could play R6 on the biggest side.

East side : 11 space
south side : 9 space];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[kq]CR[fq][nq]C[[cb22\] your stones are pretty flat (all on 3rd line) It will be hard to develop toward center.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[[cb22\] also very flat for white...]

;B[nb];W[ob];B[ld];W[jp]
(;B[hp]C[[cb22\] bad move. see variation]
(;W[gi];B[gl];W[fi];B[ei]C[[cb22\] we could consider that yose as begun as all group are settled. Defining the exact moment of yose is quite difficult, even for me !

Now you have to count : you have to imagine border of groups, where are sente reduction, double sente, double gote, gote... so explaining everything is quite gigantic ! you should read "get strong at the endgame" and "tesuji and anti-suji of go" or other books !]
;W[hm];B[mm]C[[cb22\] what is the point of your move ?];W[km]

(;B[sh]C[[cb22\] it looks like black is quite ahead as white doesn't have a lot of points. But there's a lot of small weaknesses in black stronghold...]
;W[iq]C[[cb22\] ouch... hurts a lot ! Game is over at this point (at my level :D)]

[lr]C[[cb22\] As I said to some players I know, you should try to think the purpose of every move you play. Avoid forcing your opponent to settle is group with pointless threat. For yose, you should know that most of yose problems are tsumego problems. The second point is that you have to learn how to count and reading books on this is the only way (or having a good teacher because this is so big to explain !!)

I hope that my review helped you, if you have any questions, you cand send me email @ c_billoet@yahoo.fr

Have fun !])
