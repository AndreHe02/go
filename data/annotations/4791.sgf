C[al> Dear Reviewer! Thank you for taking the time to go through this game. My major issue, as the white player, kicks off at #71, but please feel free to comment on anything of interest.

[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game.  My comments will be in double brackets.  I'm only a 7 kyu myself, so I certainly can't pretend that I know the "right" move in every position that follows.  My remarks are intended merely to highlight some of the issues at play at various points in the game and to stimulate your own thinking about it.  I hope you find them helpful!\]\]

[[For those reading this on GTL, this review was requested by White, and so that is to whom my comments are addressed, but a lot of my notes are about the Black moves.\]\]]

C[[[Empty triangle!  R14 or S14 make better shape... actually, if you're going to play in this area I kind of like S13.  But is this really the group that needs defending at this point?\]\]]
;B[fc]
(;W[kc]TR[nb][nc][nd]C[[[Now you're the one asking to be sealed in.  Don't play close to thickness, either the opponent's or your own.  If you're worried about your triangled group, N14 doesn't look too bad.\]\]]
;B[jc]TR[nb][kc][nc][nd]SQ[fc][jd]C[[[Now Black has both put your triangled group in a vise and put his squared group in a great position.\]\]]
;W[hc]C[[[If you're going to invade an enemy position, don't strengthen it first!  This would have been a lot more threatening before K17.\]\]]
;B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[fb];W[eb];B[gc]C[[[Empty triangle.  Better at H18.\]\]]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[lb]C[[[Are you trying to live tiny along the side?  Escape!  Escape while you still can!  N14 still works!\]\]]
;B[ne]C[[[Ouch!\]\]];W[hb]C[[[Note that this only works because Black played an empty triangle.\]\]]
;B[ic];W[ia]TR[hb][hc]C[al> There are probably bigger points to be taken somewhere else, though I tend to crawl like this, I think, mostly to be irritating :) My thinking is that as long as it keeps the stress on the opponents groups, mainly through separating them, it is a reasonable alternative to getting influence elsewhere. The trick is to find the balance, of course - any thoughts on how to estimate when to go for possibilities vs. influence?

[[I think you'll find that when you play stronger players, they'll be much less willing to respond to your small crawling moves this early in the game.  Instead of getting irritated and saying, "I can't believe I have to respond to this when I'd rather play this big point over here!", they will laugh and say, "Fine, take those four points - I'll play this big point over here!"\]\]

[[Essentially, it comes down to reading.  Sometimes a small-looking move needs a response: urgent moves come before big moves.  But sometimes a small-looking move is just that: small.  So if you play an endgame-style move on the first or second line, used to weak players who think, "Oh, no, I'll lose points if I respond to that - I have to defend!", you might be surprised when a strong player reads it out and says, "Yes, if I don't respond to that right away I'll lose fifteen points.  But I'll gain thirty if I play over here on the opposite side of the board."  Click!\]\]]
;B[hd];W[kd];B[je];W[me]
(;B[mf]C[[[To my eye, the variations below look better for Black.  \]\]]
;W[nf]LB[qc:13]C[[[See, way back at move 13, Black put his group at risk of being sealed in.  Seal him in, and you *might* even be able to kill the corner.\]\]]
;B[of]C[[[So he needs to work his way out...\]\]];W[ng];B[le]
C[[[Not bad - that's a forcing move...\]];W[md];B[kf]C[al> At this point, I realised that a monkey jump to r19 would eat the eyespace of the black group, but I decided to keep it in store for later, depending on how things turned out.]

(;W[mg]C[[[Except you actually have to finish the job and seal Black in!  If you're going to keep playing up here instead of at R7 or F3 or someplace, at least play at P13!\]\]]
;B[hq]C[[[Hmm, usually one would want to extend in the other direction, utilizing the power of the shimari.  I guess Black is trying for a double wing here.\]\]]
;W[mq];B[qk]C[[[No!  Too far!  Now White will strengthen his position at R10 and Black will have to rescue the R9 stone!  It was a very good idea to deprive White of R7, but Black should have played R8.\]\]]
;W[qj];B[rk];W[qa]LB[pe:24]C[al> OK, so the question is: Was this too premature, or was it reasonably timed?

[[This would be a great killing move *if* Black were sealed in.  By depriving him of his eyespace before doing so, he's finally going to realize that he has to get out of the corner - and lucky him, he can still do so.\]\]

[[He'd *really* be in trouble if not for that empty triangle back at move 24!\]\]]
;B[og];W[oi]C[al> Fatal brainfart on my part here. For some reason, I couldn't imagine that black could play s13 in the sequence that follows..]
;B[pg];W[qf];B[rg];W[qg];B[qh];W[rf];B[rh];W[sg]C[al> I was trying (more as an interesting exercise, than something I really believed in :) to go for some kind of a  ko, at least. From an economical perspective it would probably have been better to spend this stone (or rather, my last three stones) somewhere else.

[[At this point you have the upper left corner, a few points on the top, and a sliver of space on the bottom.  Things look bleak.  You need to gobble up some space in a big way.  The bottom left corner is still open.  That might be a place to start.\]\]]
;B[rj]C[al> So black connects, and has gained a nice chunk of points in the upper right. Now, all is not lost, of course, but I was unsure of how to pull off the recovering act here. What should white think like in a situation like this? The corners are pretty much settled, except for tha lower left, but an inside invasion would leave white cut off from the center, which is where the other available points are..]
;W[dq]C[al> I went for d3 instead of c3 in order to keep in touch with the center.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[cr];W[do];B[ep];W[co];B[eo];W[fq];B[eq];W[cl]

(;B[ch]C[[[Dubious.  Again, Black seems averse to running into the center, even when there's just not enough room along the side.  Look at the variation.\]\]]
;W[ef]TR[ch][cj]SQ[dd][fd]C[al> e14 feels a little lame for putting pressure on the black stones (c10, c12), but I often find it hard to determine exactly how to cut the  line of sight between two groups - f14 felt a little too far out. e13, maybe?

[[E13 does put more pressure on the triangled stones; it also forms a horse's head with the squared stones, which is generally preferred to the dog's head you have now.  It would make for a looser formation, and Black could jump in at E15, but that doesn't seem like the end of the world.\]\]]
;B[fg];W[eh]C[[[This effectively turns F13 into a peeping stone against which you didn't connect.  This is usually not recommended.\]\]]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[dh]
(;W[hp]C[al> In hindsight, e11 seems like a good addition before going elsewhere, or f12 before e10 or f10?

[[Let's find out.  See the variations below.\]\]];B[gq];W[iq]
;B[fp];W[ei];B[ek]
(;W[dk];B[dj];W[el]C[[[I just spent way too much of my life trying to find a way that you could live playing E10 without Black making a mistake, but had no luck.  It looks to me that E8 is sadly necessary.\]\]]
;B[fj]C[[[I don't think I like this.  I'd be tempted to see whether I could make the double hane at F8 work.\]\]]

(;W[fi]C[al> Yes, I know this is stupid, and, no, I can't remember what I was thinking at the time..

[[Yep, there's a reason that Kiseido doesn't publish a volume called Get Strong at Empty Triangle.\]\]]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[fh];W[gh];B[hi];W[ff];B[gg];W[gf];B[hg];W[bg]
C[al> b13 should rather have been around p7, maybe?

[[Sure, maybe.  Black bulging out at P8 would add to his lead.  But in general there's not much territory to be had in the center.\]\]]
;B[mo];W[oo]C[al> I felt that black was reaching too far, but again, how to cut the best?

[[This looks like bad shape to me: Black can cut at O4.  I haven't read it out too far, but I tend to cut at this type of position automatically.\]\]]

(;B[gk];W[np];B[pm];W[om];B[pn];W[on];B[ko]C[[[I don't like this - I'd rather jump from the secure stones in the left center toward the weak stones, because that way even if I don't make it I've expanded my territory.  This way if I don't make it I lose a big dragon.\]\]]

;W[oq];B[pr];W[or];B[ps];W[os];B[po];W[ln];B[ok]C[al> Somewhere aournd here, I felt like my possibilities definitely had run out. I did try some more things, but that was more or less out of desperation, so eventually I surrendered. Someone have said "If you think you are losing, you have not read enough", and I have found that there are often enough ways out of situations that initially feels totally lost, at least when you have the time to ananlyse, like in these games at Dragon. However, I am not strong enough to read myself to a win from here.. Are there any major possibilities left at this point, I wonder?

[[Nothing jumps out at me.  What you say has some truth to it - I happen to be on a small winning streak at the moment (soon to end, I'm sure) and most of my recent games have unfolded just as you say: I've seemingly fallen behind, then studied the board and realized, "Wait, I can cut through the enemy line right here!"  But it looks to me like Black's positions are pretty solid, so my comments end here.\]\]]
