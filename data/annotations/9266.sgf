AB[pd][dp]C[Hello (:

First of all, thanks for taking the time to review this game. I was black in this game.

This game was a free game played on KGS. Of course, I'd love to get general comments on my play as I probably don't even know where I made mistakes. But there would be two things I'd like to point out:

1.) I submitted this game to the GTL as there were a lot of situations, where I didn't know how to react and I couldn't really judge the board position to find the biggest point. I'd like you to comment a bit on that if possible.

2.) ALso, you'll see that (quite far in the middle game) the lower right corner and the upper left corner kinda went both badly for me, but I don't really understand the situation and in what way I could have done that better. Maybe you could also comment on that.

Thank you very much,

Tim

krv: Some shapes looks to me ugly, but they had worked a long time ) Anyway I've marked most moves which I dislike]
