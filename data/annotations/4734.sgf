AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Wen:
Hi TB,

im your reviewer, Wen. i will do what i can with your game and also if any not satisfy with my review, i apologize.

Because this is a handicap match... ^^

TB: To the reviewer: all my questions/comments written after the game are prefaced with "TB", like this one.  I thank you for any comments you can give.]
;W[cd];B[pj];W[nc];B[qf]LB[pd:A]C[Wen: both side is about the same, it's depend on your confident. playing at O17 is not wrong, here is much safer.
playing at Q14 is aggressive. depend on your preference.

by the way, playing handicap match with white should be aggressive.

TB: So here is my first question.  Assuming I want to kikare against A, was it right to do so from the top instead of the right side?  On the right side, I would have a struggle for life, and black would build up powerful influence in the center.  But as it is, he now has that influence anyway.]
;W[cn]C[Wen: well...it has to depend again..see the var.




ChinChuLin [15k?\]: mmm

TB: An observer (as you can see) hums at my move here.  Why?]

(;B[fq]C[wen: not really right but becareful of black's moyo


ChinChuLin [15k?\]: w mistake?

TB: Is the observer right?  It looks now like black is extremely powerful, but this is a three stone handicap game, so that's not fazing me.]

(;W[nq];B[np]
(;W[kq]C[TB: Ok, here I'm thinking that I must do something to prevent black from building a huge moyo on two sides.]
;B[mq]C[ChinChuLin [15k?\]: b is too strong now

TB: But my move was open to this which is devastating.];W[qq]
;B[pq];W[pr]C[TB: And then I make this mistake, though it turns out not to cost me.]
;B[qp];W[rq];B[rp]C[TB: Because of this move by black, which seems to be a mistake.  So now I can connect.]
;W[or];B[nr]
(;W[hq];B[co]TR[cn]C[TB: So at this point I'm thinking that I want to use the marked stone as a way to gain some influence up the left side, profiting from the contact move.]
;W[dn];B[ec]
(;W[gc]C[TB: Pincers here are supposed to be good.  But I never know how to play them well.  I have to learn, so I keep trying, but it never works out.]
;B[ee]
(;W[dd]C[TB: This looked like a bad move after I put it down. I guess I was trying to peep, which is silly at this stage, and it makes my stones look heavy already!]
;B[ed]
(;W[gd]C[too slow];B[eg];W[cg]C[TB: ok, now things aren't looking so bad for me, I'm thinking.]
;B[ei]
(;W[cj]C[TB: I'm building potential territory on the left, while hounding black's weak group a little.]
;B[ci]C[TB: How should I think about this move of black's?]

(;W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[lc]TR[pj]C[TB: Ok, now black makes a pincer. Because of the marked stone, it's going to go badly for me.]
;W[jc]C[TB: protecting life];B[ld];W[qc]C[TB: trying a grab]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb]TR[nc]C[TB: can I connect to the marked stone?]
;B[ob]TR[nc]C[TB: Duh, of course not.
Now this is dead.];W[rb]
(;B[rd]
(;W[oa];B[nb];W[rc];B[rf];W[pm]LB[nc:A]C[TB: So since A died, I have to do something, or black can play a powerful move.  But maybe this is too close to the wall?

see the variation];B[qm];W[nm];B[oq];W[qs];B[cc]C[TB: Now black grabs at my corner.  Suddenly the game doesn't look as close anymore!]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[be];B[ce]
(;W[bc];B[bf]C[At this point I realize I badly mismanaged the fight in the corner.  How should it have gone?]
;W[ad];B[cf];W[eb];B[jd];W[ne]LB[nc:A]C[TB: Maybe A can live after all? But as you'll see, I turn it into a heavy group.  Not the best plan!  I have two weak groups right now, and black plays them off against each other.

Xinwen : : 

my advice, do not try to save the so called "dead stone" first.. play around first..]
;B[nd];W[od];B[oc];W[md];B[oe];W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[mc]LB[gd:B]
[nm:A]C[TB: Here I can't help but think there was SOME way to escape more sensibly.

Xinwen : : : 

you start losing from here (=]
(;W[lf]TR[gc][jc][gd]C[TB: ok, looking ok

too slow move to escape.. must use one point jump.. but.. those stones might suffer if you wan to escape

it's might be a very bad exchange..];B[me];W[mh];B[nj]TR[ne]
C[TB: Now comes the payback for having two weak groups.

no.. it's better to sacrifice.. if you willing to escape..]
;W[nf];B[gj];W[lm]C[TB: Right here I wonder.  I'm thinking that by escaping with this move, the lower weak group is safe, and the upper one still has a chance to join up with it or join with my base on the top side.  By contrast, the lower weak group only has one possible way out.  Is this sensible thinking?]
;B[lj];W[jg]C[TB: Ok, now putting the plan into action.  Lower weak group has escaped (for the time being); time to get the upper one out.  (Accepting the sad reality that black will surely reap profit from this.)]
;B[hf]TR[eg]C[TB: Suddenly the triangled stone looks very mean.]
;W[ie]C[TB: My base on the top side is not so powerful, and this will hurt me.  But is there another way?]
;B[if]
(;W[kd];B[ke];W[kc];B[je]C[TB: Uh oh.];W[le]C[TB: This was a wasted move I think, but I'm thinking I might still be in a fight that I can win.]
;B[hd]C[TB: Now the weakness of the base at the top manifests itself.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[he];B[id];W[ge];B[jf];W[ib];B[hb]TR[le][ne][lf]
[mf][nf][of][jg][mh]C[TB: Now all hope of making a capture to save the group is gone, and it's looking heavy heavy heavy.]

(;W[gb];B[jb];W[kb];B[ia];W[jj]TR[hf][if][jf]C[TB: But perhaps I can get out the other way.  Unfortunately, the failed attempt to connect up top has given black a bunch of stones that will prevent me from getting out this way.]
;B[ji]C[TB: Pushing me against black's new wall.]
(;W[mj]C[TB: Now I'm just desperate, hoping that black will make a mistake and I can score a capture and get out.]
;B[mk];W[mi];B[nk];W[lk];B[ki];W[kj];B[li];W[ii]TR[ji][ki][li]
[lj]C[TB: Net in progress against the marked group?];B[jh];W[ih]
;B[kg]C[TB: Very close, but black finds the connection.  Was there a better play for me?]
;W[ig];B[kf];W[kh]C[TB: Trying now to shorten black's liberties, purely in hope he'll make a mistake.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[oi]C[TB: desperate attempt to find eyeshape.

Perhaps if I had not made two failed attempts to escape, I might have actually gotten eyeshape!]
;B[ni]C[TB: eye stealing tesuji, I say to myself, and it's hopeless now.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ph];B[pi]C[TB: Nope, black isn't going to mess up. :(]
;W[og];B[qh]C[TB: And that's that.

Now I have to beat back a giant lead.  But it's a handicap game, so I don't give up.]
;W[gg]C[TB: Perhaps the liberty shortening manouver will work; regardless, I must connect these stones up now.]
;B[hk]C[TB: The price of needing to connect means that black can prevent me from capitalizing on the influence I have in the lower center.]
;W[gf];B[lb]C[Black is not going to be tricked into having too few liberties.]
;W[pk]TR[qm]C[TB: Using the aji of the dead group to maybe get something, like maybe scoring this stone?]
;B[oj];W[qk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[ml]C[TB: Making the aji work]
;B[ol];W[om]C[TB: Ok, that went nicely.];B[kk]C[TB: My connections are solid, but this does prevent me from getting any real points in the middle now.]
;W[ll];B[jl];W[ik];B[il];W[qn]C[TB: Now the profit I was hoping for on the right.]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[qo];W[ql]LB[hl:A]TR[gj][hk][kk][il][jl]C[Xinwen the stones there.. to me, it seem like to have lot of nice tricks to play them see var

POSSIBLE only..];B[rk]
(;W[sn]C[TB: Ok, I didn't get the profit on the right side I was hoping for.]
;B[lo]C[TB: Now I realize that black's plays in the middle are threatening on two fronts here.  I must make sure the base on the bottom lives.]

(;W[lp];B[mo];W[kn]C[TB: If I can connect the two, at least I live.]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[jo];W[in];B[io]
(;W[fi]C[TB: Perhaps black's group in the upper left can be killed.  I'm desperate now, of course.]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[fj];W[gh];B[gm]TR[fi]C[TB: The price for playing the trangled stone, I guess.]
;W[gn];B[ho];W[go];B[hn]C[TB: no connection, so...];W[ro]C[TB: make life]
;B[hm];W[cq]C[TB: steal something];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bo]C[TB: woo hoo! finally something paid off well.  If black in the upper left can be coerced into failing, then I could pull this one out.]
;B[fm];W[en];B[gp];W[fn];B[hp]C[TB: But I must live in the bottom, at all costs.]
;W[gr];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[kp];B[jp]
TR[fr]C[TB: I think this was a mistake. Black should have played at F2, which kills me, right?]
;W[fr]C[TB: Now I can live.];B[er];W[ms];B[ns]C[TB: Black has to block the impending connection.]
;W[ls]TR[gq][fs][is][js]C[TB: I am now assured of getting to play at least one of the marked spots, so I live.]
;B[gq]TR[fs][is][js];W[hr]TR[fs][is][js];B[js]TR[fs][is];W[is]
C[TB: There ya go.];B[mp];W[kr];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[aq];B[el]
C[TB: If I could have ended the exchanges in the lower-left corner with sente, then black would not have been able to score this big point.]
;W[dl];B[bj]C[TB: ok, time to work on the upper left group.]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh];W[aj]C[TB: It looks like the group might have trouble getting eyes now!]
;B[ah];W[fg]C[If black plays here, he's sure to live, and if I play it, he has real trouble.  So of course I start there.]
;B[eh];W[de]C[Likewise here, If black plays here, he's sure to live.]
;B[df]C[TB: ok, now I screw up.];W[ai]C[TB: bzzt.  this was a useless move.  Nothing bad happens if black plays here, I just connect and the situation is unchanged.  Instead, I allow black to do this:]
;B[af]CR[dg][ch]TR[bg]C[TB: Still a chance. I should play B13 now.  Then I will get to play either D13 or C12 next.]
;W[ae]C[TB: Instead, I repeat the same mistake I just made at A11.]
;B[bg]C[TB: Whoops.  The game is over, but I finish it out for endgame practice, such as it is.]
;W[em];B[ek];W[dk];B[hj];W[ij];B[mn];W[sp];B[rl];W[sl];B[sj]
;W[fc];B[na]C[TB: Oops, it now occurs to me that my group in this corner isn't as live as I thought.  Turns out black didn't notice that.]
;W[pa]C[TB: *crossing fingers*];B[nl]TR[qa]C[TB: Whew, black doesn't kill at R19. But I can't go save the corner yet.]
;W[mm];B[nn]C[TB: ok, now I can.];W[qa];B[on];W[pn];B[po];W[kl]

u have a very difficutl battle,

this 22K is much more better than usual 22K he should like.. the same strength as you

for my advice, you have a potential that's willingness to take risk so go ahead with you own way..remember to study Joseki, and Tesuji..

do some goproblems often too good for you.
