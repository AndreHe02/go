C[JL: Hi, I hope my comments are useful to you

i am playing white

a lot of fighting right up to the end

i think my understanding of fuseki is decent but as far as fighting is concerned i've got a long road to go

surely i missed a lot of good moves obvious to a 9d but for the review i am interested more in big blunders I made and  the opportunities I missed that a 10k should never miss.]

i wanted to settle quickly as running didnt look very attractive

;B[ho];W[kq]C[i am still not good at these tactical exchanges

i don't like the result as my three stones are cut-off
on the other hand i got the side

JL: Try and read a couple of moves ahead before you play these out!

This exchange is not good, the stones at O3 were alive anyway, the L3 group does nothing for them.

Black on the other hand has gained a huge amount of territory. Try and estimate how much black has in the bottom-left now.

C[as i look at it now, i dont think this move was necessary
i could have played elsewhere

JL: Yep, you lost a sente move here];B[rg]LB[qh:A]C[it would be natural to extend to A but i would hate to see black jump to O15, so i decide to attack now]
;W[lc];B[md]
(;W[ld];B[mf];W[le];B[me]C[couldnt quite decide what the best thing to do here]

(;W[hc]TR[fc][lc][ld][le]C[JL: This is terrible.

Look how inefficient these stones are];B[pf]C[what are my options after this cut, what are the major issues to consider?

JL: It should be simple to read this out. Read it out before you play!!!]
;W[pg];B[of]C[JL At this point it should be clear that P18 needs to connect to M17. There is no other way for it to live.]

(;W[og]C[JL: now you die for sure. Did you try to read this out?]

(;B[ng]C[JL: Black is so kind he gives you ANOTHER CHANCE!]

(;W[oe];B[nf]
(;W[oi]C[JL: and you STILL DON'T CONNECT!!!!];B[nb]C[JL: finally he kills you. GAME OVER for the second time.

Go is about keeping the balance of power and territory throughout the game. Normally you can play a good move anywhere on the board because it will help you to maintain the balance.

What you must learn to look out for is URGENT moves. These are moves that prevent the balance from tipping radically in your opponent's favour. The two points where you missed those moves resulted in you losing the game (twice).

Try to estimate black's territory vs white's territory here.

My advice is to play slower and try to read further to see what kind of situation you're going end up with. 10 moves in 5 minutes is too fast. Try something like 15 moves in 10 minutes.

Review stops here. I also made some comments later at moves 146, 148]
