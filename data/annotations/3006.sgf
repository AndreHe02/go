C[Hi reviewer,

I played black in this game, i lost by 20 points. I want to know what are my bigger mistakes.
I'm trying to improve my global sense of the game, please don't hesitate to add some remarks about it, and about anything else you consider to be weak in my play.

I put some notes along this game.

thanks in advance,

zakalwe.


Hi Zakalwe,

I've given you comments where I think you could have been a little more proactive or effective. Your main problem seems to be failing to identify weak enemy groups. You generally had no problems protecting your own groups, but you neglected several excellent opportunities to attack your opponent throughout the game.

Key principles to keep in mind when playing go:

1. Check if your groups can be hurt or hassled for profit, meaning: do they lack liberties, a base, eye potential, an escape route, or a connection? If so, fix your group. Defending moves can be slow and single-purpose, but you must have stable groups in order to operate well throughout the game.

Then,

2. Check if your opponent has any groups that can be hurt or hassled for profit. Look for any of the weaknesses mentioned above. If you can find one or more, exploit them for profit. If not...

Then,

3. Play the biggest move. Generally favour practicle, "sure", "cash-in-hand" moves over tentative, flimsy territory moves, or wild, deep invasions. Go is about practical and simple thinking, and the patient acquisition of territory.

I've included a number of variations to demonstrate some possible alternatives to the game. Please don't treat these as the absolute truth, but as suggestions on how you might have gone differently, and ideas to think about in the future.

I hope my comments are helpful.

Cheers,

A: I think O16 is fine, but white did not follow joseki.];W[oc]
C[here i hesitate between P16 and Q17. I choosed P16 because of R10. But maybe R10 is too low, Q17 would have been a big corner ...

A: P16 is too submissive. P17 is not joseki, so you can probably get a good result with Q17.]

;W[ng];B[nf];W[oh]C[here i feel that my last 2 moves are bad.

A: I think you're ok. Your stones are connected, and white is weak. Now is the time to attack. Even if you can't capture white, you can probably make profit in the process.]

(;B[lh]C[A principle in go is not attaching to weak groups. Doing this makes them stronger, and thereby harder to attack. Black is not particularly weak here, so I would play more of a surrounding move.]

C[here i can take M5 in shisho (se variation), but in the game i didn't find the appropriate moment to do it (i think it's quite big)

I think i must answer this move, white group is still weak, and i keep a big corner.]

(;B[op]LB[ko:B][op:A]C[This leaves some aji on your corner, and defends an area that is not weak. Consider descending at Q2.]
;W[jf]
(;B[ie]C[maybe instead of this move i should have played L5.
But i thought white is building a big moyo, so i wanted to invade. I think my following moves are not good ... may be have you a better idea ?

A: Yes, white is still weak. You can surely do something.];W[je]

(;B[dj]LB[cf:B][ci:A][cl:C]C[w is strong at the bottom, he can build at the top ...

A: This ignores an important principle in invading a side that has a strong enemy positions in each corner. You want to take the middle point, which has corresponding miai extensions. Playing at A allows an extension to either B or C, depending on how white responds. The D10 stone has fewer options.

Also, there's a lot of room on the left, so play on the 3rd line, which is intended for settling quickly. Fourth line moves are intended for influence, and influence is not so important right now, except with regard to attacking K10. However, I don't see D10 as having a particularly strong effect on the weak white group, it being fairly weak itself, and poorly connected out.]
;W[ch]C[I would treat d10 lightly, and invade the top. Or maybe something like J12.]

(;B[eh]C[This move has no purpose. It is a poorly connected way to escape the D10 stone (which can be treated lightly in any case), and does not attack white or stake out a large framework, generally the only instances in which you should play a keima.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[fh];B[gh]C[may be the wrong direction for b.

A: Your group is heavy now, and it will be hard to control the white territory at top. You have built up some nice thickness though, so you might be able to attack the white centre.]

A: Please see my other comments.];W[gk]
(;B[bj]C[i wanted to see what could i do here ...

A: This is a living move. White is too secure. A much better approach would be reducing with E7. B10 is unreasonable. Also, you have lost your opportunity to capture the white centre.

Also, your centre is somewhat weak.]

C[i thought it is important for me to prevent w from connecting his big center group.

A: Indeed, but because of B10, it is difficulty to attack effectively. Now if you attack too aggressively, your position on the right will crumble.]

At this stage, i don't now if the priority is to defend my weak group or to keep presure on white center ...

A: You are attacking too hard, and the expense of your right side. This is never good, and as a habit it should be broken as soon as possible. Large dragons are very hard to kill. It is better, often, to merely hassle them for profit.]
