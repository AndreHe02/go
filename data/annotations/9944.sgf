C[Hello! I was actually a 5 kyu on KGS, but I decided to try a 1 kyu account on Tygem to see how stronger kyus played. I can beat them about 25% of the time, but lost this one. I think I tend to be behind in the opening, I have trouble deciding how to establish a good position. Hopefully this game can demonstrate what I mean. I was white in this game


AJ: Hello, I'm a 4dan on Tygem, 2danish on KGS. I'll be reviewing your game today. My comments will be prefaced with AJ: and I'll write a summary at the last move.]

(;W[qf]TR[nc][bd][cf]C[I feel like I should have pincired here, but I watned to keep the game simple and get sente to attack the left.

AJ: This move is quite good. Since Black left the right hand side unifinished, you'll get to attack one of the two marked groups.]
;B[hc]
(;W[bc];B[kc]C[AJ: Now it's difficult to attack Black severely.]

(;W[ci];B[ef];W[fe]C[This aims to separate and then counterattack the top]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[cd];W[de];B[bg]
(;W[jd]LB[jc:A][lc:B]TR[cf][ef][ff]C[AJ: This is a bit premature. White is already plenty strong in the area. AND White is ahead of Black, so leaning doesn't actually help attack the marked group. And now you're helping Black fix his aji at the top that you could have used differently. Maybe with an attachment at A or B, which is a more severe reduction.]
;B[he]C[AJ: This is an inappropriate time to resist for Black, the result should be good for you.]
;W[gf]C[AJ: Yes, this is the move you wanted to play anyway. Good response.]
;B[ic]
(;W[hf]C[this removed the aji from that position, I dont like playing it :/ Might have been better to extend my side stone

AJ: Correct. This is a really slow move. White is already 100% alive in the corner, and out into the center so it's not so important to come out further.]
;B[ie];W[cn]C[I extended too far here, right?

AJ: It's not so much that this is too far, it's that you're treating C11 as a light stone. If Black were stronger, then this move would be perfect. But since C11 can be part of a very severe attack against the Black group, then C11 isn't light so you should support it more. In this case, because Black is so weak and G14 is helping you, attacking directly is more appropriate.]
;B[ck];W[ei]C[AJ: After the pincer you see that C11 is an important stone so you strengthen it. This move is inconsistent with C6. By the way C11 is really important so]
;B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[df];B[cg];W[dg]TR[ie][hf]C[AJ: This is still a good result for White, but would have been better without the marked exchange.]
;B[bp]
(;W[en]LB[cb:1][kb:6][rd:2][ff:A][fg:3][ah:4][cq:5][qq:7]TR[bg]
[bh][bi]C[should I have jumped here? I gave him so many free points , but I couldnt see another way to save the group. maybe my mistake was in the following moves

AJ: A couple of things here. First, you didn't give him ANY free poitns. White is still winning in this game. Notice how many stones are on the 2nd line. You should be HAPPY with the result.

Second, the jump is premature. You already received adequate compensation by cutting off the A group. You're strong in the center. And you should be so eager to use the C6 stone right away. Maybe you'll get some more stones in the center and you can sacrifice it to develop a large moyo.

Maybe you don't believe me that White is still better here. Let's do a quick count.

White's territory is numbered 1-3.
1: about 10 points. (just the corner)
2: about 6 points (depending on who plays first
3: At least 10 points, plus influence in the center.
White total: 26, 32 with komi.

Black's territory is at 4-7.
4: 5 points.
5: 10 points
6: 10 points
7: 5 points
Black's total: 30.

Now who has more potential to grow? Black doesn't have any useful stones facing the center. White's upper left corner is more developable. So the game is still good for White.]

(;W[ir]TR[gp][jq]C[AJ: This is not a good move. It's only aiming at one thing, and black is already separated.]
;B[mq]TR[ir]C[AJ: Now Black gets territory along the bottom and White loses a good approach at R6. The marked exchange is really bad for White.]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[gr];B[fr]

[jp:C][cr:6][ir:B][pr:5]TR[jq][mq][jr]SQ[fq][fr]C[AJ: Ah now I see the purpose of J2. You shouldn't be aiming to live directly. White was never truly in danger of dying here. Black is still weak in the center, as long as you're by a weak group you shouldn't need to make life directly.

Lets take another break here to count territory.

White has territory marked 1-4.
1: 10 - Same as before
2: 3
3: 6 - Same as before
4: 10 - Same as before. However, there's a big difference. Now Black has a wall facing White's influence. And the wall isn't weak so now this is only worth 12 poitns, it's not 12 points + influence.
White's total: 29, 35 with komi
  

Black has territory marked 5-8
5: about 15. It's tough to say since Black is a little thin. This territory has grown by about 10 points because of the traingle stones.
6: 14. This territory has grown by a few points and has become completely solid because of the square stones.
7: 7. This territory has also grown by a couple of points and become more solid because of the circle stones.
8: ~10. This is the same.
Technically Black has some more with the J7 stick of stones. We can count that as 2 points since we're assuming it's going to live (with 2 eyes). But the main thing these stones are doing is reducing White's influence from the are at #4.
Black's total: about 45 points.
Black is now winning by a few points, plus it's his sente.

Notice what happened? Black gained more territory and White only gained an extra group at 2 worth 3 points.

We can say that this is a result of not attacking Black's A group when you were able to. And slowly making life with the moves at B, and C. Each of those moves were negative points when you could have played more actively.]
;B[kl]
(;W[jk]C[AJ: This move is too heavy. Black is not going to die here since he's so close to friendly stones. And White's wall is too far away.]
;B[ln];W[kn]C[AJ: Too blunt.];B[km];W[mm]C[AJ: Too blunt.];B[lm]
;W[lo]C[AJ: White doesn't have a good attack here. It is incredibly easy for Black to make eyes, escape, or harrass weak White stones in the area. All of these moves should be at Q18 which is the biggest for points right now.]

(;W[nl]C[I'm not attacking in a profitable way here, but I'm not sure what would have been better

AJ: See variation at move 90. Also, this sort of result is why I mentioned Q18 is bigger than R6 now. Especially after Black got a strong group at N6. Black has more stone around so the fight is good for him.]

[mr:9]TR[jk][jl]C[AJ: Lets pause here for one more count. And we'll assume White lives in the corner, as you thought you did.


White has points from 1-6.
1: 10
2: 3
4: 3 (again this can die)
5: 5 We can reduce this some because now Black has another wall facing it so it's points are less certain.
6: 10
Total: 31, 37.5 with komi

Black has points from 7-11
7: 8
8: 14
9: 12 plus maybe swallowing the sqare stones, so 14.
10: 10
11: 2 again, assuming Black is going to live with 2 points.
Total: 48
Black is still winning even if white lives in the corner. So we can say White's fighting on the right gained no points. Black separated White into small groups which don't score well. White's primary source of territory has been the same ever since the first 20 moves.]

(;B[kh];W[je]TR[ji][hj][jk][jl]C[AJ: Black captures the stones in the center. So he gained an extra 15 points in the center that we weren't counting before. My comparison, we never counted territory around K16 as territory for Black, so White gained nothing except a slight reduction with pushing at K17 later.]

Summary of the game:

First White missed at big opportunity to attack Black severely at A. 

Next Whtie treated his important at C lightly by playing at B. Black split his stones but white was still able to make a good result by cutting off Black's square stones. This remained White's biggest source of territory for the whole game.

White drew his stone out at D a bit prematurely and didn't focus on the whole board. White wasn't able to take advantage of Black's weak stones at E, so he fell behind after he made a very slow life at F. From this point on White's E group had gained a lot of strength, so was reducing White's influence around C. This put White behind in territory and was never able to catch up. Black's strong group around E also made making territory on the right side of the board almost impossible.

White made another small life starting with G, but Black solidified his territory on the bottom and sealed White in.

White then made a dubious invasion at H which became ko, even though it could have been killed for most of the game.

Black was able to cut off some important White stones with I, creating an extra 15 points of territory in the center.



What can we learn from this game?

You need to practice timing your attack better. You missed an attack against Black's Square group at the very beginning which would have given you a good advange. You still got a good result after you cut through at A, but you still felt behind, so you pulled your approach stone out. That would have been okay but you missed a chance for a good squeeze with the driving tesuji, and, more importantly, missed attacking Black's 3 stones severely. You had strong influnce facing the 3 stones so they were much weaker than your stones. That means you should be able to profit by attacking. Later you found a move that captured them outright, good job. I missed it.

Making life at F was really bad. You were no where near weak enough that you needed to make a small, gote life. You need to see the weaknesses in your opponents stones and not fear being attacked. I think you were playing more timid because you feel you're playing against stronger players. Maybe that's true, but you should try to play your same game as you do when you're playing normally.

The last big mistake was trying to attack Black's strong group with the blunt circled moves. The chance to attack that group severely was lost.

In general I think you can play close to a Tygem 1kyu level. But you need more practice with life and death (H), and appropriate times to attack. I think that comes from not recognizing strong and weak groups.

I hope you find my review helpful and that we both learn from this game. If you have any questions or comments please email me back and I'd be happy to explain any parts further.
