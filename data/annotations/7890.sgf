Rib: Good fuseki, I play often this myself];W[nc]
(;B[qg]C[Rib: It's better to just play at q14, playing lower position here is not very profitable hence you have strength on the lower side.]

;W[qb];B[oc];W[rf];B[rg];W[qf];B[pf]
(;W[qe]C[JMR: Perhaps it would be better to protect against the cut by providing an extension around R10?

Rib: P12 is quite good and probably correct shape, hence it spreads the influence towards the center (which is almost always good)

Of course black can tenuki all the same, cut isn't that severe, but it might cause problems later

This move is not necessary for white...]N[JMR]
(;B[oh];W[ic]LB[cf:A][df:B][cn:C][fq:D]C[Rib: I think it's more solid and mind calming to play something of the lettered moves]
(;B[ce]C[Rib: I feel this is silghtly too close, because white has a helping stone on upper side]
(;W[ed]C[Rib: D12 is a fine idea, also c11 maby c12]N[JMR]
(;B[bc]C[JMR: I think this would only be reasonable if white D17 was weak; should be at D12?

Rib: Yea this was a bit of an overplay.]N[JMR]
(;W[dg]
(;B[ee]C[JMR: I was concerned about the the possibility of White replying at E14, but perhaps I shouldn't have been.

Rib: Black shape does seem weak (E14 is not to be worried about). Fortunately black has more ko threats so there isn't anything to worry about on that side so white has basically one move here, c14]
N[JMR]
(;W[fe];B[ef]C[JMR I was quite happy with this exchange.

Rib: Yes, black got everything he wanted and white really didn't gain anything]
N[JMR];W[cj]
(;B[jq]C[JMR: Perhaps this should be at K4, as White is going to have  to invade, and 4th line would be better for attacking or escaping if isolated?

Rib: Well, if you really want to play such strategy j4 is basically only move (ok yes 4th line should be played :P)

I prefer F3 tough]N[JMR];W[fq]
(;B[cn]C[Rib: Invasion probably better than this];W[cp]C[JMR I wonder about black B13 next, but I didn't want to leave myself a very weak group at C6.

Rib: the group is already weak no matter what you do next, but it's a choice of strategy (b13 opens up certain possibilities at g16 area, e18 ect.)]
N[JMR]
(;B[cl];W[bg];B[fm]C[Rib: upper left must be protected, white can't really mount a strong attack against c6 group atm so better to make sure upper left is alive so that you can rely on that group in the future]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[cb];W[oo]C[JMR: I played A, as I thought the right side has the bigger potential territory, as opposed to O4.]
N[JMR]
(;B[pn];W[nq];B[nr];W[or]C[JMR: I know that normally one would play B, but I didn't want to leave K3 weak, giving White a weak group to chase, perhaps a splitting attack on K3/F7.  I though it better to take the loss in the corner - although I now think I should have played B.

Rib: Yes, q2 is must now. It's not like o3 group will become invincible if you do]

N[JMR];W[nl];B[pk];W[nb]C[JMR: O16 is big, but I was concerned about ko with white C16 etc.

Rib: Such ko is troubling as game is so close anyway, but there is a better way to defend]

(;B[fa]C[Rib: This seems a bit off beat, I think it's just better to play o16]
;W[ne];B[md]C[JMR: my plan here was to put down stones in the region, either separating the white groups, or threatening to do so, and then threatening to connect to them with H19 (since White hasn't responded to the monkey jump) and escaping to the centre, or use their aji to get some stones in the region of L14.

Rib: plan is good but dangerous (tho black is slightly behind so he has to do something :)]
N[JMR];W[nd];B[kd]
(;W[lf]C[Rib: white move seems to be off by one];B[kf]C[JMR: I think this is premature, committing myself to escaping with a heavy group: should be keeping the possibility of merely threatening to connect to them, with stones around L13.

Rib: there isn't anything bigger on the board so it's ok to try and escape]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[le];B[ha];W[ke]C[JMR: should have played B, consistant with my original plan.  Huge move.  White has ignored H19 ; if I can't connnect K14 to L16 this white territory is huge.

Rib: Yes, k18 should be played here]

JMR: Even without without, say 14 points around M18, White is still well ahead, so I must have done something else pretty bad.

Rib: to summarise, 
lower right decided the game, 
upper left... don't keima in the corner if there is kosumi :)
also be aware of the balance of territory it's very important that you know you can't win the game in few decisive moves so consider lighter approach sometimes :P
lower left, just invade normally :)

After the situation in the upper left I thought black was way ahead and didn't need anything special to win ^^]
