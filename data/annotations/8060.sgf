C[Hi!

In this game, I really got crushed in the opening and in the middle game. It would be nice if you could help me figure out
what I maybe could have done instead.

Thank you so much for your time and effort.

;W[dc]TR[pj]C[Should black maybe tenuki now and do something with this stone?

reid: No, this joseki ends up well for black.  Anytime your stones are working together, you have no reason to complain.  The normal continuation ends with a black extension around K17 or L17, which works well with the Q16 high stone.

The marked (Q10) stone may be annoying, but it is not taking any territory and it is difficult to attack, so no need to rush.]
;B[gd];W[cf];B[kc]LB[mc:A]C[reid: L17 is joseki, but considering the Q16 stone, it might be even better to play at A.  In any case, this is a good result for black.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd]C[reid: R14 is natural, but S16 is a very bad move.  We will see why in a moment.

Instead of S16, white should invade at R17 and live in the corner.  Q10 is light and should have no trouble limiting the outside thickness will black gets if he blocks at R16.]
;B[qc]LB[qi:A]C[reid: this is a very good result for black.  To understand why, consider the joseki: the white stone should be at A instead of Q10.

This shape has a severe problem.  White can invade  easily at A or B to gouge out white's base and take his eye-shape.

Note that without the S16 / R17 exchange, white can sacrifice R14 by changing direction to live at R17.  After the exchange, the two stones (R14/S16) are too big to sacrifice.  The shape is heavy.]
;W[mq];B[ql];W[rk];B[qe]C[reid:  This exchange is sente, but it is aji-keshi (erases the aji).  It helps white much more than it helps black.  Better to leave it unplayed.]
;W[re];B[pf];W[qg]C[reid: Now there is almost no aji left in the white shape.]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[reid: white is expecting too much here.];B[fp]
;W[jq]LB[dn:A]C[reid: White needs both this move and A.  That is why E2 is too ambitious.]
;B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[ep];W[dq]C[reid: another good result for black.  White has a large corner, true, but white had a stone in the corner first.  The black outside stones are more valueable than the white corner.  That is why white must be able to play D6 after E3.]
;B[cl]C[reid:  However, there is no need to hane here.  The left side is small since white already has C14 in place.  Extending to D8 would be much stronger shape.  The two cuts could be a problem for black later.]
;W[hc];B[hd]LB[gb:A]C[reid: Black needs to prevent white from linking up here.  He should divide and fight!  The stones in the L17 direction are very strong, and the F17 stones mean that black has an overwhelming numerical superiority in this area.  Perfect conditions for black to fight!.  Black A (G18) splits white.  If white does not block at H18, black can connect under if he needs to.]

(;B[dl];W[bl];B[kr]LB[qk:D][pl:E][rl:C][mr:B][nr:A]C[I see now that this might not be the best way to attack this group.

reid: Yes, it is difficult to attack a group that already has a base.  Black could perhaps play at A instead, followed by C, white D, black E.  This would make for a close game, but it looks like black will have trouble giving the komi.]
;W[kq];B[mr];W[nr];B[lq];W[lp];B[ls];W[lr];B[gc]TR[qi]C[To small... Maybe I shold go here instead

reid: Perhaps.  But black probably doesn't have enough ko threats to win this fight anyway.  White N1 is too large.]
;W[ms];B[gb]C[The rest of the game is really not very interesting. But I would be very thankful if you could point out my flaws (direction, shapet etc)

reid: Yes, the shapes are all settled now, but white has a territorial lead.  Black can only hope for mistakes from white.

Cutting the game here shows a nice appreciation of the significance of the opening.

I think the key to understanding why this game turned to white's favor lies with just a few crucial points.  First the aji-keshi starting with R15 which allowed white to patch up his bad shape.  Second, blocking white with H16 istead of going for the fight with G18.  After that, white is comfortable.

I don't think the overly ambitious attack at L2 changed the status of the game, it just made the situation clearer.

The lessons to take away from this game are first, avoid helping your opponent.  Just because a move is sente doesn't mean it's a good move.  And second, if a fight is looming, evaluate whether it is in your favor or not.  If you have the advantage, then don't be afraid to fight!  In the final analysis, your fighting ability is what will make you a stronger player, so embrace the fights that are in your favor.

Good luck, play strong - reid])
(;B[bl];W[dl]C[reid: Yes, this is not a promising line to persue.]
