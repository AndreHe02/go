(;W[ec]M[cf][gd]C[pem: This is not a good idea with the
black marked stone (C14) in place, though in this case the white marked  stone (G16) makes it less fatal. The problem is the cut at E16. (See  variation of this move for the normal joseki.)]
;B[eb]C[pem: Accordningly, cutting at E16 would be more aggressive.];W[fc]
;B[fb];W[dg];B[hb]C[pem: This is not bad (but  maybe small?), but Black can do the usual B16, B15, ..., exchange in sente  first.]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[fq]
(;B[hq]C[pem: Do not let White play on the outside of the double approached stone  like this. Even if it can escape, White gains while Black gets very little  (as we will see in the actual game). There are two variations of this move.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[co];W[dq];B[bn];W[do];B[cp];W[fn]C[pem: As expected, White ends up with most  of the corner and influence on the outside.]
;B[rp]C[pem: R4 is  maybe a stronger move if one wants to secure the corner. The question is if  this is urgent however.]
;W[om];B[ng]C[pem: Perhaps P14  instead? Or why not R17 first?];W[oc]C[pem: A big move by White.]
;B[nc];W[pc];B[mc]C[pem: I would perhaps have  prefered O18 instead.];W
[qq];B[pq]C[pem: It's good to  resist a peep when possible, but I don't think this is the time. Actually,  with the normal response, R4, White will have a lot of trouble to live in the  corner, if it is at all possible.]

(;B[oh]C[pem: This results in bad shape and the Q12 group being cut off.  (See  variations of this move).]
;W[og];B[ni]C[pem: A solid  connection at O12 is better.];W[nf];B[ne]C[pem: This move  does not connect the groups. Making eye-shape with for instance N13 prefered.]

;B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[nj];B[mj];W[nk];B[mi];W[ok];B[mk]C[pem: Maybe a bit slow? It's not making any eyes,  so extending towards the center directly is perhaps better?]

 oerlikon 10k : Starting observation.];W[ll];B[kk];W[jm];B[em]C[pem: This  almost induced White to do something Black doesn't want.
Instead, Black should continue to run with the center group. (Cutting White  with L7 is another idea, but it's hard to read out the consequences.)]

 oerlikon 10k : Starting observation.];B[hf];W[ie];B[df]C[pem: Good move, and the  beginning of a good sequence by Black.]

C[pem: Black has  compensated for the loss of the right center group, but White is about 15pts  ahead by my estimate, and has influence over the weak lower side.]

[mh];W[lg];B[gc];W[hc];B[gb];W[kd];B[fd];W[ae];B[bd];W[pe];B[bq]C[pem:  Several big endgame moves now, this is one of them, but apparently White  didn't think it sente (or big enough).]
;W[nb];B[lb]C[pem: N18  works, doesn't it?];W[mb];B[lc];W[cr];B[eq];W[er]
;B[br];W[ho]C[pem: This hurts Black.];B[ic];W[jc];B[ma];W[oa];B[ib];W[id]
;B[cs];W[dr];B[gr]C[pem: Another important move.];W[fr];B[dn]C[pem: This is worth 5 points in gote. Pushing at Q5 is worth  more in sente.]

[ls][mr][ms][ns][or][os][ps][qs]C[pem: Overall, an interesting game. White opened at the third right hand  line, claiming territory, while Black had most of his stones on the fourth  line, aiming at influence. However, Black tried to use this for territory
only, while White got major influence after killing the Black center group,  in the area where Black's influence should have been.  When Black killed  White's left side group he got material compensation, but ended in gote with  no influence.]
