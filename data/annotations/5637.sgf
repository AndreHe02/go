C[This seems to me hard to accept to have lost cause when I realized to where loosing, it was too late to do anything for me.
So I began to guess in the beginning of the game, which moves make me loose. I've got an idea, but I would like to have a confirm of this.

Thanks for your help, Mirco.


s> Hello, thank you for the chance to review your game.  I had to ask around to stronger players to get the key issues.

My comments are preceded by s>
The next frame has the key moves to improve on.

The frame before the move to change has letters showing what the options are.  I would suggest considering each one, and looking for a minute or two thinking what would follow.


In General
- play for the long term good, by making strong groups ( good shape )
- look for moves you can ignore for larger scale effect.
- try not playing too thin or far apart.  one must make a fist before one can strike.]
;B[cp]C[s> these moves were most critical:

6> consider forming a small group in his space
10> take profit and protect the corner.
14> *big* defend solid and prepare to attack the upper group
24> sacrifice a stone to get stronger and keep initiative.
28> *big* don't get too thin, get good shape to stay strong.
32> *big* don't stretch too far, peep and then extend
36> split the two weak groups and get stronger.
50> *urgent* let a small move go for a bigger larger scale item

57> the game is over.  no review input past here.

112> when attacked, can you take away his escape route?
154> *big* everything is settled, attack his large group in KO. with this type of fight you can get one group or another.
167> when he attacked you can cut under his stones.];W[pp];B[dd]
;W[pc];B[eq]LB[fc:A][qe:C][cf:D][cj:B][jj:E]C[s> black has a strong corner in the lower left, sure territory, a weapon to fight with.  white has some options.

A> attack the upper left corner, then extend back and work with Q17

B> go between the two black groups, prevent them from working together.

C> get your own strong corner to match his.

D> attack his corner, get something on the left side.

E> get some influence.]
(;W[fc]C[s> this pushes the two groups together, C4 and E3 are strong, now this end will also be strong.  your attacking move of F17 induced black to get a large left side.]
;B[cf];W[id];B[nc]LB[lc:A][pe:B]C[s> white can react in at least two ways:

B> defend and protect the side
C> lean into the stone getting more of center.
D> threaten the O3 stone a bit more, build up to attack O15 ( best )]

(;W[lq]LB[cp:B][eq:A]C[s> the attacking move here is not so good when black has the other corner on the same side ( A = E3 and B = C4 ).  The reason being that M3 has nowhere to run to.

also, this does not help to attack the O17 and O15 stones.]

(;B[jq]LB[lo:B][mp:C][np:A]C[s> different options, depending on the long term goals.
A> directly pushing on the stone like this will probably force black to live, and white]

(;W[np]C[s> In general a contact play will solidify both sides.  when defending use contact, when attacking play light.  The play of M3 was light, attacking. then O4 is contact, defending.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[pq];W[oq];B[lr]LB[qq:C][kr:B][or:A]C[s> different choices, the white stones are floating, what direction do you want them to get strong in?  black will live with something, where will you push him?

B> double step down, complicated, have to read the possible outcomes
C> take corner space]

[om:A]SQ[bd][el][go][cq][gq]C[s> white has some options, considering the current state.

A> seal in black group
B> take away black group's eye in a ko fight
C> threaten to take away J11

the group R6 is surrounded, one big eye, the edge part S4 has few liberties, and is close to edge. two stones at S5 and R5 would kill it.

the group O14 has one eye, and almost has another.  white can kill it if black loses a ko fight.

black has surrounded a great deal more territory than white, around 20.  if white is to win he needs to do something drastic.

- invade and have something live, 10 of his stones, and 10 of the other guys stones will do it.  where can he invade...

for an invasion to work each stone needs to threaten to extend in multiple directions, or maybe connect to friendly stones.  I think it is too late now to invade.  but there are some places to throw down stones before going for an invasion.
G5, E8, B16

maybe the other guy will get scared and make a mistake.]

;W[ef];B[ed];W[fd];B[ma]LB[la:A][nb:B]C[s> White can 
A> defend directly 
B> cut underneath

It is this kind of move where you need to slow down, take a minute and read out where it can go.  

Some clues are:
- the stone at P18 has nothing above or below, 
- and Q17 and Q18 are there.
- the J18 area is surrounded enough that he cannot make life]
