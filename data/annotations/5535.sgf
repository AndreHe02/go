C[Digital8 10k vs. ethan 9k

I ended up winning this one by a healthy margin but I was wondering a couple things in general, and, of course, would always appreciate general help.

Could I have handled the upper right hand side fight better and could my opponent have won it?

-You got the top right, he had no chance.

I feel I misjudged the largeness of some moves and played too slowly at times, especially concerning the lower left.  Please help me with this.

-Try not to do small "pushing" moves that will lose you your sente, or help your opponent secure his territory.

Thank you and I look forward to your comments.];B[pd];W[pp]
