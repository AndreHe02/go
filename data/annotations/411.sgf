WR[20k]KM[5.5];B[dp]C[A few words on my commentary that follows:

I hope it will be construed as coming from me with good humor, as well as 
humility.

As the players of this game are listed at 20k (IGS without *rating) I 
am assuming each is fairly new to the game, and will try to comment very 
thoroughly.

Certainly, none of the comments I make here should be taken as personal 
attacks on either player!

This review is being constructed using SmartGo v4.1 on a Macintosh 
personal computer.

This review comes at the request of dsmith, the black player in this game.

Having glanced over this game twice now, I think there are some fairly 
straightforward lessons here.  This game is just about as "simple" as a 
19x19 Go game can get.

Probably this primary lesson to learn here is this:  There is a 
difference between "territory" and potential or "moyo."

For example, on this the first move...
D4 does NOT equal territory and you should not count on it as such.  
White can easily invade at C3 and take territory there.  But D4 is still 
a good move, since if White does C3 now, Black will get a wall facing 
outward that should help Black get a large territory elsewhere.  Keep 
this in mind as the game progresses....];W[pp];B[dd];W[qd]C[White often 
plays on 4-4 or 3-3 points in the opening in hopes of developing very 
quickly, since White is behind a move [Black went first\].

So White played a 3-4 point instead.  What does White want, and how can 
Black exploit this?

White plays 3-4 in hopes of playing P16-17 next, securing the corner 
rather strongly, and having influence that points towards the bottom 
where White has another stone.  If Black were to 'pass' [theory only!\] 
White would play at P16 and be in a much stronger position than black 
already.

Even if Black plays at P16 or P17 now, White still can take the corner 
territory, or White can allow Black in there and play for influence 
facing the bottom.  Either way, Black will also come away with something 
- which is better [for Black\] than just letting White take the corner 
for both territory and influence.

Go is a game of balance - at this point in the game it is usually a 
question of balance of territory vs. influence.  If Black plays in the 
top right now, he will get one or the other.  If Black does not, White 
gets BOTH qualities in the top right - so Black had better keep the 
balance with a VERY big move elsewhere!

My opinion is that Black should P16 now.  If White P17, Black O17, then 
maybe Q17, O16, Q15, K16, Q10 - White gets super right side, but black 
gets super top side.  Many other variations are possible, but generally, 
both share in the spoils.];B[dj]C[This is a big move.  D10 compliments both 4-4 points on the 
left, and the influence that this creates should help Black to attack 
white.  I recommended to black in a past game to try sanren-sei openings 
for a while, so I will not condemn this move!

However, here I might have preferred Black P16, as White could be very 
happy with P17 now. 

If White P17 next, Black almost MUST play on the right [maybe Q10\], or 
white at Q10 will be very strong there.  After that, White might attack 
Black with R12 [double purpose move - attacks black and strengthens top 
right\] which induces Black to play around R6, and then White can defend 
his Lower Left corner.  All of this fighting would benefit White I 
believe, giving him strong positions unaffected thus far by the Black 
sanren-sei stones on the left.
 
It is best to use a sanren-sei opening with the plan to attack white 
elsewhere on the board and force white to run towards the sanren-sei side 
of the board where black is strong.];W[pk]C[This is fairly strange move 
to me.

Opening theory basics:   Corner first, then sides, then middle.

White may be thinking that Black will now play P16, and then white will 
attach at P15 and try to build a wall facing downwards.  In that case, 
white might be trying to get more space between that wall and Move #6.    
If this is what white wanted, I would probaby have recommended extending 
further to white around Q7 perhaps.];B[jd]C[Now begins a moyo - black 
is really staking out some big areas on the right and top (but none of 
these areas are territory yet).];W[jq]C[Both players now have a fairly 
balanced looking board.

One gets the feeling that White is trying more for real territory in this 
game with the low moves at R16 and K3, but White still only possesses 
potential, or moyo, like Black.

The "half finished" top right still draws my attention - black can still 
split the spoils there - I would definitely play there now.];B[jj]C[I 
think this is premature, although the strategic intention it implies is 
not necessarily a bad one.

This play may take the "corners first, then sides, then middle" a bit too 
literally.  I feel like the corners are not yet settled [Any of them\] 
and so moving to the middle now is not urgent enough.

If black instead at P16 now, white does not want to play the sequence - 
Black P16, W P17, O17, Q17, O16, R14.  This sequence would work perfectly 
for Black with his stone at K16, and white would be left with too much 
space between his last stone at R14 and the stone at Q9 - so Black would 
take the lead and invade around Q11 or something.

Since that would be terrible for White, he must respond to Black P16 with 
something else, like P15 playing for outside influence that will work 
with Q9.  This would in turn allow Black to take the corner and get 
territory.  

Back to main lesson of this game - it is good to balance your own playing 
between influence and territory.  Just as it is good to balance against 
your opponents gains.  In this game Black is very one sided with 
influence, and unless there is a plan in mind to transform that into 
territory, Black will end up without enough territory.];W[lp]C[A bit 'slow' by White I think.

Black can still invade at R-3 anytime.  So White at M4 does NOT secure 
territory yet.  It also does not extend White's influence to new parts of 
the board.

I prefer White at P17 or O17 or F4?];B[hp]C[Black loves the 4th line in 
this game!  

I still prefer P16 or maybe even D3 for black.

D3?  Well, this would secure the corner strongly, and would make it 
difficult for White to play all the way to F3 [which is essentially the 
same reason for Black's actual play at H4 anyway...\] since if White F3, 
then Black, backed by two stones at D3-4 could split White at H3 
easily.];W[iq]C[This seems a bit pointless at this stage of the game.  
Black cannot really attack between K3 and M4, so this is not needed for 
defense yet, and it only serves to induce Black to play at H3 next, which 
would work very strongly with the lower right corner.

Even so, Black now could still leave this spot and play at P16 which is 
bigger at this early stage of the game.];B[gr]C[Doesn't really do the job 
any better than simply playing at H3.];W[md]C[Good for White now to play 
in this area.  It seems like Black could still separate this stone by 
playing at P16, so I might prefer a play around O16.];B[kf]C[More 
influence, no territory...

How about Black at Q11 now - reduces Whites moyo and can run to Black K10 
for strength if needed??];W[ne]C[Very cautious.

Black might now consider C17.  This would strengthen both the top and 
left, and guarantee some territory around there.];B[lc];W[mc];B[ld];W[mb]
C[This is one of those endgame moves that is not worth enought pts 
to play yet.  White would gain a LOT more by playing at R3 now, or White 
would reduce Black by a lot more by playing at C17 
now...];B[lb];W[la]C[bad move

it is not sente because there are much bigger moves elsewhere.  If black 
ignores, and white plays L19, black can play at K18 to stop him for 
instance.];B[ka]C[given the comments on the last move, black should 
probaly play at r3 or c17 or around 
q11...];W[ma];B[kb];W[le];B[ke]C[black is now very strong here, and his 
earlier play at L14 is paying off.  In the forthcoming moves there is a 
'race' to stay ahead and have the power to force the boundary in one's 
favor.  Since black is ahead now, he should easily stay ahead in this 
race.

But given the great strength of black's group at the top middle, black 
might consider playing D17 as soon as possible, which would virtually 
lock up the top left corner and upper sides for huge 
gain.];W[lf];B[kh]C[I think Black does not need to jump here to stay 
ahead in this pushing race.    Playing at M14 is ok and Black can push 
White lower with a double hane push [M13 then White N13, Black N12\]

However, in the overall picture, moves at C17 or R3 are bigger and 
better.];W[lg];B[kg]C[Just following the opponent's orders with this move.  If 
black must play locally, then maybe better at m12. Black is very strong 
in the middle here, and should use this advantage.];W[lh];B[li]C[good to 
finally push white a bit - even if perhaps 
late];W[mi];B[lk];W[mk];B[jo];W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[mj];W[nj];B[lj];W[ml]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[is]C[This is definitely a 
move for the endgame.

Black has such a strong wall down the middle, but unfortunately, unless 
Black plays to secure the corners, he will be left with a small center 
territory, which will be a waste of such a huge unfluential 
wall.];W[jr];B[hr];W[js];B[kp];W[kq];B[jp];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[jn];W[ni]
;B[jl]C[Unecessary 
i think];W[hq];B[gq];W[ir];B[hs]C[This is the smallest possible move of value 
that one can make in a game, - 1 pt. There is simply no reason to play 
this now, since there are plays that are worth >20 pts on the board, such 
as R3 and C17.

It may just be a question of experience, and the ability to see that C17 
is vulnerable to invasion.  So count this game as experience, because the 
invasion is nigh! :)];W[ip];B[gp];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[im];W[ho];B[go];W
[lq];B[hl];W[cd]C[In almost all games between 30k-20k 
players, you find that the players try to 'finish' a local fight before 
moving elsewhere on the board.  In this game, we see this happen with the 
border fight starting at the top and progressing the whole way across the 
board until finally there is no more board on which to fight (locally). 
 Black and White here both play very small points in this local fight, 
even 1 point plays!   Meanwhile, either player could at anytime leave 
this fight and play HUGE points in the corners (>20pts).

There is a definite skill jump evident when a player stops acting this 
way, and starts to move from one area of the board to the next based on 
the value of a move, instead of forcing local fights to the bitter end.  
Since it takes experience to understand the value of a move, I'd 
recommend these players start experimenting.  Try leaving fights if you 
can't see a huge local loss for doing so, and seek out new invasions or 
plays elsewhere that look to take lots of points.   You may lose games at 
first, but you will surely learn and 
improve.];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg];W[ag]C[b12 much better here or least 
d17];B[bi];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb];B[db];W[da];B[ea];W[ca];B[eb];W[bf]C[unnecessary]
;B[ch]C[unnecessary also - this corner 
seems played out.

definitely would be bigger to play Black C4 or R3 now.];W[cp];B[ae]C[i 
think this is fruitless - if white plays elsewhere now then black will be 
giving away the stone for free.  It would be better for black to pass!

White should next play again in the bottom left at c3 or 
d3.];W[bc]C[pointless];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[dn];W[an]C[again, white plays a 1 point endgame move that should 
probably be the last move of the game.];B[am];W[ao];B[cq]C[good - but 
only because of white mistake.  This capture almost gives black the 
game.];W[dq];B[bq];W[bh];B[di];W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[bj];W[pq]C[white pretty much seals up the game with 
this move.  Black has had ample time to invade down here, and White 
should have defended here long ago also...];B[ap]C[completely 
unnecessary.  This move merely reduces Blacks score by 1 point.  Again - 
it would have been better to pass!

White at B7 was not a real threat as black could capture 
anytime...];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[So white wins the game by a few points.  

But there still may be some invasion potential for black to try in this 
game, perhaps around the top right and middle right.  If black can invade 
successfully, white will be greatly reduced in territory, even if black 
gets just a small life there. This would be worth studying for the 
players.

Black should probably have won given the capture in the bottom left 
corner.  However, white should have lived here anyway. A close game that 
was strangely symmetrical - White and Black both forming giant 
territories. 

In hindsight, white got to most of the big points on the board first, 
such as the corner invasions and the play at q3.  Black played too 
carefully, often giving sente away to white to play these moves 
(examples: Black L19, C12, H1...)

Potential vs. Territory lesson:  A big wall in this middle of the board 
is too far from the corners to stop and invasion there, so owning half 
the board in the manner of this game can only be called at best moyo, but 
not territory!

Good luck!])
