C[Hi,
I will try to point you in thinking more clearly on your moves in this game.
Please read my specific comments as examples of concepts.
You will find it will help you much more :)

It is clear you know a few joseki, and opening theory,
You have two big weakness points in this game:
1. You do not look enough if what you learned is good for the scenario on the board
2. Because of a weak opening you started running after your opponent and let him lead the game.

My most important tip for you, every move look at the whole board before you put your stone, decide on at least 3 key places you wish to play and only then choose the best. Remember your opponent is not much better than you, and most of his moves are also mistakes :)

\m/ : Hi, I will review the review. I was once 1k on KGS and I'm starting to play again after a year break. I'm not native English speaker so this review maybe full of language mistakes (and full of go mistakes too but it's another point)
My comments will start with \m/. 

As noticed after, whole board strategy is a little bit different in 13x13 because the center is smaller. 
For me it's the most technical board size as it is really hard to recover from a mistake (as in 9x9) but you can't rely only on a big local fight (like in 9x9).

I don't agree with your "most important tip", you'll see why in my conclusion comment at last move. It's the only point where I don't agree in this review. I go further on some points or present some alternative to other point but you made a great review here in general.

Flo];B[jd]C[Playing the star point is a good move at the opening. It implies you aim for the center and sides, and you care less about the corner. It is a move which pays out in the long run.

The problem is you play a 13x13 game. The game is short with no "long run"
The center is small and there are hardly any sides, the corner is much more important.

This move is possible, but you need to be stronger to use it correctly.
3x3 point or 4x3 are easier.

\m/ : agree];W[kj];B[dj]C[\m/ : cross star point is calling for fierce battle, why not, it's a good training and funny games. Not the safest way to victory though.]
;W[dc]C[White has stronger base, black is already weaker.
Black will need to be very aggressive to pull this off

\m/: True, let's fight !];B[ce]C[Good move! Take out the base.]
;W[cd];B[de]LB[dj:A]MA[di]C[Correct.
If two than three rule.
Your two stone pillar need A to be one line closer (x) . Remember you have a weakness on the left side]
;W[fc]C[White made a secure base];B[hc]MA[kf]LB[jd:A][ik:B]
[fk:C]C[White is very secure in the top left.
Black 9 does not threaten him in any way.
That means your move gave up sente,
White does not need to respond and he takes the lead.

Extending from A is a good idea, but you chose the top which is smaller than the right. (X) is better. B is even better.

\m/ : right, maybe C is worth thinking too, helping your weakness on the left side and covering your star point stone. A is not weak yet.]
;W[ch]
(;B[fk]C[Your joseki is correct.
But it does not take into account the two black stones in the top left.
White can easily attack them if you are not quick.];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[bk];B[bl]LB[ik:A]C[White is crawling into the corner.
Black started with the star points - claiming the center and not the corner.

It is much better to play faster where you have influence and let white gain 2 more points.

A would be a good choice

\m/ : both A and game move are ok for me here, it's just not the same game. With black A, white can live anytime with c2 so he is free to attack black 2 stones.

With the game move, both black and white are not alive so b will have to pick some things on the upcoming fight, which is not easy here.]
;W[cj];B[dl];W[di]C[\m/ : this is gote, b should help his 2 stones]
;B[ej];W[ge]C[\m/ : now it becomes difficult for b];B[kf]LB[kc:A]
[ke:B][ik:a]C[This move is dangerous.
It feels like you protect the corner but it does not secure it.
White at A can easily live inside.
Black at B will secure the corner.

However the most important move is to secure the two black stones on the left.

Always look at the whole board and see what your opponents move tries to achieve.
The top right corner is not under immediate attack after white 20. The black stones on the left are.

\m/ :  You're right on the direction, corner is not urgent.
But locally white A is a ko to live (so not so easy but still B is better to protect corner).

Because black doesn't care of the 2 stones, your comment on move 15 was right, A would have been better.]
;W[ik]TR[fh]C[This is a strong move by white.
The fuseki is over.

\m/ : patient and good move but gives b a chance to fight. Marked move is worth thinking but w22 may be better move.]
;B[fg]LB[ef:A]C[What does this move try to achieve?
White can easily cut at A

It does not threaten any white group.
It does not claim any territory.

It appears more of wishful thinking.

\m/ : I'll be more prudent with that move. This shape is seen quite often for getting a position by sacrifying some stones.
Though it does not work well here because of c6];W[ef]
(;B[hg]C[White already claims a huge territory in the top left, and a secure corner in the bottom right.

Black has only a very small territory in the bottom left. Move 25 is much to passive for this stage.]
;W[lg]C[\m/ : strong territorial move.
Black d7 is a little bit complicated to read here now that black has h7 helping.]
;B[lf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh]TR[fg][hg][jg]C[The three marked stones did not achieve territory for black, nor save the two stones in the top left.

Always try to have a plan on what you try to gain];B[ih];W[jf]
;B[ig];W[ji]LB[jf:A];B[if]LB[jf:A]C[Black 35 is correct locally but it is not urgent. It cost black in sente which is worth much more.

A does not threaten anyone.

\m/ : this is bigger than it looks as A stone can help white for invading the corner so this will be a good safe move if b was not so far behind. In this game it's a little slow as b needs to find one magic move to win this game.]

But it stood a chance before the border was so secure];W[bh]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[be];W[cg];B[bf];W[ed]C[jerry.xu09: THX

\m/ : the whole game, the left side was the urgent place to play and b comes here too late. Before playing a move I try to think like that :

1/ Do I have a weak group ?
If yes : how can I make it strong ?
If no : go to 2

2/ Do my opponents have a weak group ?
If yes : how can I benefit from attacking it ? (attack does not mean kill !)
If no : go to 3

3/ Where's is the biggest point on the board ?

In this game, both players often directly go to the 3rd point without considering one and two.

Though I don't have time setting here, this way of thinking before every move is not possible in blitz. I don't recommend  playing blitz games before getting really strong at reading (and I'm not, so I don't play blitz :D)]
