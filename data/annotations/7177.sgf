Dear Reviewer,
In this game I think I got to a good start. I believe my opponent made a mistake in the first joseki but
I am not sure if I took the best advatnage of it. In the middle game I seemed to get a promising position and I believed I should win by a large margin. I was able to kill a large group  of his but then he also killed some stones of mine. Then he manage to crawl deeply into my big moyo - I feel I should have been able to stop him earlier in this but not sure how. In the end it was very close, so review of  the endgame moves will also be much appreciated. (white only 0.5 komi).
Thank you!

Hi, I'm dN21death on KGS. I'm a low dan so please don't take everything I say very seriously. =D So, I'm kind of confused because it seems the game has been reviewed already or I'm supposed to do a review of a review but I'll try to review it anyways. xD

Being able to see shape patterns and using good shape for connections was something you should work on. Also for the endgame white seemed to take control of it. You had two chances to take sente I think. Well Good luck and continue having fun. =O]
