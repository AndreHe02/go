AB[pp][dp][jj][pd][dd]C[samabcde [3d\]: hi



Hi, I was playing black. I just want to know how to play better against a 3d and where I could have been more aggressive. I think the reason why I lost was partly because I was afraid of the way he'd attack. I'm also not used to handicaps so I think I need more practice on playing with handicaps.

Comments by Az];W[nq];B[qn];W[fq];B[kq]LB[jp:A]C[Risky?

Az: Not risky - you're stronger than white is here - but maybe a little off the mark. 'a' is probably better since it attacks both stones and it's harder for white to surround you on the 4th line.]
;W[iq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[no];B[ko]C[Az: Good move.];W[km]
;B[io]C[How to play here? Protect or run out?

Az: This is ok];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[fn];W[jp];B[mp];W[np];B[jo]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[ln]C[Az: This is ok for black]
;W[nm];B[lm]LB[ml:A]C[Az: Better at 'a'];W[ql]LB[on:A][nn:B]
[pl:C]C[Az: Peep and then attache on top with 'c', black doesn't want to get surrounded and have to live locally.]
;B[pq];W[kk];B[ll];W[kj]TR[nm][no][np][nq][ql]C[At this point I felt that I didn't use the tengen stone efficiently.

Az: Attacking these stones is more important than the center group now - you can attack it later.]

(;B[ji];W[qf];B[qj]LB[nk:A]C[Az: Good fighting spirit, but until black has a stone at 'a' this isn't really very severe. That might be a better place to start.]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[pl];B[po];W[oj];B[qh]LB[pg:A][mj:B][pf:C]C[Az: Slow. You need to decide if you are going to hold onto these stones or give them. For a handicap game you should be especially aware when creating weak groups. The most severe response is 'a', but since you haven't yet seperated the white stones with 'b' and this is a handicap game that might be a little too much. If on the other hand you decide you're ready to give up your stone, attaching at 'c' makes white over concentrated.]
;W[pg];B[oi];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[ni];W[pj];B[qg];W[pf]C[Az: Whether black lives or dies, the result is going to be bad for sure. Being forced to live locally like this costs you a handicap stone each time - and the price goes up if you try to live but die.]

;B[rq];W[ro];B[nr];W[ki];B[nd]C[Az: Good move];W[jh]
(;B[hi]C[Az: This is not as urgent as closing the corner to attack white. It makes your stones strong, whites weak, and takes profit in sente. As white runs out (since w cannot connect) you can play here naturally.]
;W[ih];B[hk];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Az: This is always the wrong answer. Play on the other side first, even if you then change direction (less profit for white and weaker shape).]
;W[qd];B[kc]C[Looking back I think I could have extended a little farther.

Az: Bad idea, stay tight since you want to have strong shape for the fight that's coming in the center.]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[gg]LB[fk:A][jl:B][kh:C]C[Az: Cutting immediately is risky against a stronger player. You have a cut at 'b' you can use later but it's gote. Jumping to 'a' almost connects up your weak group to the other stones and you can go back to cut at 'a' moment later if W doesn't fix.]
;B[kh]C[Was this cut appropriate?

Az: Even game sure, handicap game I'd worry a little.];W[fj]
;B[hh];W[hg]C[Here I don't know how to escape.];B[fk]TR[hg]
[hh]C[Az: This exchange does nothing for black, so skip it and play here directly.]
;W[gj]
(;B[kl]TR[jj][ji]C[Az: I don't understand this move. Black cannot give up the cutting stones under any conditions, so this is one of the biggest mistakes of the game.]
;W[jk];B[gk];W[hj];B[ik];W[ij];B[jl]LB[ej:A][ei:B][di:C]C[Az: Wrong direction of play. Double hane to use whites shortage of liberties.]
;W[ek]LB[el:A]C[Az: You can block directly without fear.];B[fm]
;W[el]LB[ej:A][fl:B][cf:C][cl:D]C[Az: Cutting at 'a' is impossible, there is no followup. The moves to consider here at 'b', 'c', and 'd'. 'b' is somewhere between 10-20 points of gote (depends if you plan on answering  to save your 4 stones, I don't recommend it). 'c' is really big because it neutralizes influences while taking profit. 'd' is not so big since your corner is already strong. So 'c' is probably best since the terroritory here is small.]
;B[ej];W[dj];B[ei];W[di];B[eh];W[dh];B[eg];W[fl]
(;B[il]C[Az: This is not really very big, especially since it *only* saves your 4 stones, you need another move to capture white. Therefore this is worth only 8-10 points. White seems fairly strong so I wouldn't assume white will play here necessarily, but if he does you stand a fairly good chance of winning (see variation).]
;W[dg];B[gl]C[Should I have saved the black stones? I think I lost more territory than I gained here...

Az: This is only a few points better than passing at this point of the game. The other stones are much bigger in terms of points but also in terms of the whole board.]
;W[ef];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[dk];B[cf];W[em]LB[cn:A]C[Az: Defend at 'a', white cannot connect.]
;B[en];W[dm];B[cm];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[Here should I have given up the three stones? (I added a variation here)

Az: The white group is alive but not with too much room to spare. You should descend to threaten white (this is most often the best move, though not always).]
;W[er];B[gd]LB[ec:A]C[Az: Much too far so close to thickness. Something like 'a' is more reasonable.]
;W[dc]C[How to respond to the attachment? I saved the corner, but could I have been more aggressive?

Az: White is not being unreasonable here, black was thin. Best to keep the corner and then worry about the damage.]
;B[cc];W[ec]
(;B[ed]LB[cb:A]C[Az: 'a' is the *only* move.];W[fe]LB[cb:A]
C[Az: 'a' is still best, black has bad aji this way];B[fc];W[cb]
;B[bc];W[mc];B[ld];W[ic]LB[md:A]C[Az: Defending at 'a' is easiest. In the game black made things very complicated but ended up with less profit in the end.]
