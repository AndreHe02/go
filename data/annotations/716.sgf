;B[pq];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[oc];W[po];B[mp]LB[np:a]C[More common would be A.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[Possible, but definitely not joseki. Better would be variation 1.]
;W[qp];B[qr]LB[oo:a]C[A seems to be more important. If black plays there he can press white down. If white plays, he can press black down. So A is the local key-point.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[qj]
(;B[qg]LB[pe:a][lc:b]TR[qj]C[Not good!!
Before white played the marked stone this pincer against the corner would be OK (allthough I would prefer to play A, see variation 2), but right now black is to weak in this area. A move like 15 should be better prepared. If there was a black stone around B, black 15 would be OK. But now black is under attack and white can take profit.]
;W[pe];B[og]TR[oc]C[Black has to run, but now his marked stone is getting weaker.]
;W[ne];B[lc]TR[og][qg]C[Now black has to defend on the other side and the marked stones are getting weak. Every white move is putting preasure on both black groups. This is very good for white.]
;W[nj]LB[oj:a]C[Good (but A would be even better). White can attack the weak black group and take profit (on the lower right) at the same time.]
;B[re]LB[mg:a]C[No good idea.     Black should keep running with A now. He started the fight and now he has to keep fighting. If he is trying to built a base in this small space, white will have a lot of sente moves against him. White will be able to settle himself and to take territorial profit. So white can take the lead in means of territory and in the means of power. Black will gain nothing.]
;W[rd];B[ri];W[rj];B[oi]LB[oj:A]TR[nj]C[This is why A would be better than 20.]
;W[oj];B[mh]C[White is now stronger on both sides and black is still not alive. So black is still running towards the center. He could do this without strenghening white.]
;W[qi]LB[de:a][hq:b]C[Too small.     White should make a shimari at A or an invasion at B.]
;B[rh]C[Too small. Black will make no eyes there.];W[rf];B[lf]
C[Things getting worse.
After all these moves, black has no eye yet and is still running. Moves 21 to 29 were only helpig white to settle his shape.]
;W[le];B[qb]C[I'm not sure about this move. If this move is not sente against the white group, it is too small.]
;W[pc]C[This move is helps black to build up good shape.];B[pb]
;W[nc]C[Not good.     White has just to settle himself, not to take blacks territory away. Whites profit area is on the lower right. On the upper right all he wants to be is safe. But now he is creating a weakness in his own shape.]
;B[od]C[OK.];W[oe];B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[mf]C[36 was bad. But blacks position is still inferior. White can play 42 (=settling himself) in sente!]
;B[lg];W[ce]C[Big!];B[hc]LB[ep:A][oo:B]C[Black wants to eliminate the possibility of an white extension on the upper side, but this is not big enough.     The black stones are all on the 3rd line and white has still the possibility to press from above. Black won't make much territory there. A would be bigger! Pressing at B seems also attraktive to me.]
;W[ke]LB[hq:A][oo:B]C[Also too small.     Black won't get so much there. So white can't take much away. A and B are good points for white.]
;B[jc]C[Too small!];W[ep]LB[hq:A][eq:B][kq:C]C[Should be at A.
This is because W can then extend to either B or C.]
(;B[dn]C[Too peaceful.     If there is a chance to play a pincer and a extension at the same time - take it!! Playing at the lower side would be really big. See variation 3.]
;W[cq];B[dp]C[As in the lower right: this is not the joseki move.]
;W[dq];B[cj];W[jq]LB[hq:A]C[Once more an overextension by white.
Since black is quite strong at the right, an invasion at A would be good.]
;B[he]C[Why there?     Black is separating two (almost) settled white groups. So he is not gaining power. And 55 is also not gaining territory. A wasted move.]
;W[ni]LB[jo:A][hq:B][oo:C]C[Too small!     Black has nothing in this area, so what wants white to take away from him?    A (protecting the weakness at B) or C would be much bigger.]
;B[nh];W[ph]C[Still the same: to small.     Black should think about taking sente and attack on the lower side. Even if white cuts, black has to sacrify only 3 stones (approx. 10 points) and white has to spend an extra move.]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[qc]LB[ng:a][pg:b]C[1. Dangerous: White threats to cut at A. And this cut is twice as big as a cut at B would have been.
2. Localy also not good. It is a small and it is gote! If white connects black is in atari.]
;W[pd];B[rg]TR[nd][od][oc]LB[qg:A][rh:B][og:C][nh:D]C[Bad.     Black has to rescue his marked stones. Otherwise he may lose the corner.     But even if black was not forced to play on the upper side, 63 is a mistake. A and B are allready connected. C and D are not.]
;W[ob]C[Of course.];B[rc]LB[ra:A][ng:B]C[I think after 65 the corner is still dead (white A). Black can possibly connect underneath (only in ko) but white can still cut him off with B and black has only one eye.]
;W[qe]C[Not the best way to play for white.];B[sb]LB[ra:A][ng:B]
C[Black is adding stones to a dead group! A still kills him.     But since 66 was not good, black has the chance to save some of his stones with B. That is the move he has to make.]
;W[ng]LB[ra:A]C[OK.     After 66 white can kill (only) one of the black groups. 68 is as big as A.]
;B[ra]C[Black needs to defend here, so white has killed a group in sente!]
;W[jo]C[Finally!!     Very big.];B[go];W[eo]LB[fo:a]C[I think A would be better.]
;B[en];W[fn]C[White should think about this cut twice. I think it is possible to cut, because black is even weaker than white - but: white has a big lead (at least 20 points). He should play safe and simple.     Black is the one that has to fight.]
;B[fo];W[fm];B[hm]LB[hn:a]C[Correct shape is A.]
(;W[fq]C[White has changed his mind. First he cuts and than he is not willing to fight. This is definitely not good (but in this game white can afford it).]
;B[gk]C[Not good. Variation 4 is still possible.];W[do]C[Not the best move, but probably good enough.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[bo]LB[bn:a]C[Better at A. It threatens to rescue the 2 black stones and leaves no cutting point.]
;W[bp]LB[bn:A]C[Now black has a weakness at A.];B[bn]C[White captured 2 stones in sente. Not good for black.]
;W[dh]LB[oo:A]C[Possible.     Variation 4 or a move at A would be bigger.]
;B[ip]C[Good. This removes one of the major black weaknesses.]
;W[jp];B[hn]LB[ej:a]TR[fo][go]C[Maybe better at A.
89 rescues the marked stones, but letting white have A is probably worse.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[dk]LB[fk:a]C[Wrong side. White should threaten to rescue his 2 stones with A and than play 92 to reduce the black territory.]
;B[dj];W[fk];B[el];W[fl]C[I don't think that white can survive this way!]
;B[fj];W[ei];B[gi]C[A solid connection would be slightly better. This hangig connection gives white an additional sente move.]
;W[em]C[Useless.];B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[fi];B[gj]
;W[ao];B[bk];W[jh]LB[gh:a]C[Because of blacks weakness, this moves seems possilble. But 110 is not really connected to one of the white groups. I would prefer A.]
;B[jj]LB[gh:A]C[Possible, but i would prefer once more A, because the black stones are quite weak.]
;W[kj]LB[ml:A][oo:B]C[Not good.      Attaching will help black to settle himself. White should play B now (which is sente against the black group on the lower right) and then play a move like A. White should not go and try to capture the 4 weak black stones now.     James Kerwin (1d pro) said in a workshop a few weeks ago: "The last thing you want, is to capture your opponents useless stones - this just ends his pain."]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[kl]C[Now black has settled himself. Not good for white.]
;W[ki];B[ll];W[mk];B[ml]LB[nm:a]C[Better at A. This move helps white to make good shape.]
;W[nl];B[mn]LB[oo:A]C[Much better at A.];W[oo]C[Finally!    But is not so big anymore, since black is connected.]
;B[hq]C[Nice.];W[hr];B[ir]C[The hane on the other side woud have been better.]
;W[iq];B[gr];W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr]LB[fp:a]C[Better at A. Black shouldn't let white connect his stones!]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[jr];B[hs];W[er];B[fp]C[Better late than never!]
;W[io];B[fs];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[kp]C[This is just creating a weakness in the black shape. It can not hinder white from living.]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[kq]LB[lo:a]C[White should push once more with A, making use of the black weakness.]
;B[ls]LB[mr:a]C[Not good.    Just play at A.];W[ks]C[OK, white doesn't punish black for the mistake.]
;B[lo]LB[db:a][nm:b]C[Not big enough!     B would be much bigger. And I would like to try A.]
;W[gd]LB[nm:A][bh:B][fb:C]C[Better at A, B or C .];B[ge]LB[nm:A]
[bh:B][fb:C]C[Still A,B or C.];W[fe];B[hd];W[fc];B[gg]C[All moves from 151 to 155 are too small.]
;W[im];B[il];W[jm];B[jl]C[Too small.];W[no]C[Good.];B[mo];W[mr]
C[OK.];B[nr];W[nm];B[jg]C[Good.];W[mm]LB[la:a][bh:b]C[Too small.
I would prefer A or B.];B[lm];W[jf];B[kf]LB[ig:a][kg:b]C[That is the wrong move.
Black must play at A. If white wants to cut at B, black answers at 169 and captures either B or 168.]
;W[ig]C[Now black lost his stones.];B[is]LB[eq:A]C[This is a gote move worth 0 points.
If white plays at 171, black simply captures at A. White can not win two kos at the same time, so black is safe.]
;W[ie]LB[bh:A][la:B]C[Still A and B are bigger moves.];B[hg]
;W[fg];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[in];B[gl];W[mb]C[OK.];B[gc];W[fd]
;B[lb];W[ns]LB[bh:A]C[A is the biggest endgame move for a long time - but nobody wants it.]
;B[os]LB[nq:a]C[Dangerous! This leaves a cut at A.];W[nq]C[There it is.]
;B[or];W[op];B[ms]C[Useless.    White is alive, black is dead.]
;W[ns];B[ms];W[qs]C[White spends a move to kill a dead group.]
;B[js]C[0 point gote move.];W[ls]C[Not necessary.];B[fb]LB[bh:A]
C[Still A is the bigger move.];W[eb];B[fa];W[ea];B[gb];W[la]

;W[bf];B[cg];W[dg];B[cf];W[df]LB[be:a]C[Better at A.];B[be]
;W[bd];B[af];W[cd];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae]LB[bc:a]C[Black should try A. In such a ko fight, black has nothing to lose but a lot to win.]
;W[bc];B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[gh];B[hh];W[fh];B[kg]LB[ih:a]C[Just throwing away a point. A on the other hand would capture a stone in sente.]
;W[ih];B[hi];W[nn];B[mg]C[These stones are dead. Black can do nothing about it.]
;W[nf]C[White could afford playing elsewhere. Back is trying to connect two eyeless groups to create a big eyeless group.]

;B[kn];W[ff];B[np];W[oq]C[White has a huge win. Problems started with the not well prepared invasion of 15. This was almost the game losing move. With 49 played as a pincer on the lower side, black probably could catch up.  From there on black was fighting brave until the endgame, but white was always in the better position.
169 and 185 were blunders - but that can happen to anybody.]
