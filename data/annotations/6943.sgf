C[Hello reviewer, I am Lukas 14k (9k on KGS). In this game I made some mistakes and had to resign in early middle game. I would like to see opinion of some stronger player to point some more obvious mistakes, I may have missed.

Thank you.

I will put in comments as dr:];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[lc:1][jd:a][qf:2]C[This maybe wong decision, since i don't have any pincer around A.
Would Q14 or so be better response?
 
dr:I would prefer to play at 1 or 2. w is low at D17 so perhaps 2]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jc];B[de]C[ dr: you are ok in UR. this is even result]
;W[ed]
(;B[dh]LB[cc:a]C[Not knowing standard joseki and instead of attaching a stone on A have helped my opponent secure his corner while atacking me in next move. Would variation be any better?

 dr: see the comments in the variation];W[cd]C[ dr: b is over concentrated compared to w so D12 is not good]
;B[ck];W[cm]
(;B[ce]C[I got scared of atack that would steal my base.];W[po]

(;B[op]C[ dr: this gives w an easy life in corner.  see the thread]
;W[qq];B[lp];W[pr];B[or];W[pp];B[oq];W[qm]C[ dr: b is overconcentrated here.  The extension looks nice but since w is secure in corner, R9 has become weak.  see the thread]

(;B[ok];W[jp]
(;B[nf];W[qi]LB[pj:A][jn:B]C[As every beginner, I had a serious trouble deciding how to respond here

 dr: A also prevents connection.  see the thread.  all the b stones become secure and the w lower right is seriously weakened.  Probably this is an overplay by w since the lower right group is not secure after s8 and s9.  Perhaps w should play around B instead.]

(;B[rk]C[So I tried to ensure, he wont connect easily];W[pj]

(;B[oj]LB[pk:a]C[This was propably mistake, maybe I should treat it as kikashi and simply connect at A and strenghen my position in center while chasing hit group.

 dr: yes];W[pk];B[pl];W[ql];B[pi];W[qj];B[qh];W[ol]C[Following sequence is a reckless miscalculation on my part.

dr: The thread will give a better result  :-(]

;B[oh]LB[oi:a]C[Propably better co connect at A and avoid possible kikashi in future]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ni];B[oi];W[kq]
(;B[lq]C[I got scared of losing the whole group. Looking at the game now, maybe I should've try to start some serious fight in lower left area first, since my oponent was far ahead already.]
;W[eq]LB[hc:B][ic:A][cn:C][iq:D]C[dr: at this point you are way behind so need to do something desparate or resign.  The b groups are all secure so you can attack vigorously and hope for complications and mistakes.

C should give a large sente reduction.  D threatens to cut off some weak stones or give a large reduction.

These are my last comments.]
(;B[dl]C[dr: this is slow considering the board situation.  B needs a lot more so see the threads.]
