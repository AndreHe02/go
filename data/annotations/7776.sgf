C[Thinking:
Thanks to anyone reviewing this game.

Main focus should be made on using influence/thickness/strength/walls.

How to use it?

In this game, I only had thickness, and no idea on how to use it.

Stay away from thickness!
Drive your opponent towards thickness!
Don't use your thickness to make territory!

I don't know what went wrong.

Please ignore the fact that I won the game by resign, it was due to opponent's overplays.]

Black A has double purpose: gives a base to c14 and takes away the proper extension of c6.

Because your opponents strong move is often a strong move for yourself too, I would prefer C11 instead of E15. See variation]

Black will get shut in between my walls.

ch: I am not convinced. You are separating 2 strong groups. There is nothing to attack for white. In contrary, the white group E15 might get under pressure...

I didn't have any good moves in mind, so I decided to put pressure on the top left group.

ch: hm, c11 is not weak, it has a base, so it is difficult to attack it.
The E15 group has no base, so you have to be careful.];W[ei]

(;B[ck];W[ek];B[iq]C[ch: good move];W[gr]LB[sq:A]C[Black wanted to connect, so I naturally cut.

ch: :-) connecting and making a base with m3 is miai, so you could consider to play tenuki. E.g. A]
(;B[lq]C[I really didn't know how to deal with this situation, so I decided to cap once again.

ch: you should thing about the follow-up moves, this is important!
If you find no good move, better tenuki.
Locally I would prefer L4 like in the variation]
(;W[lo]LB[sq:A]C[ch: better play A in the corner. M3 is not really weak...]

;W[kr];B[ks];W[jr];B[js];W[ir]C[At this point black resigned (and didn't thank me for the game, which is quite common among us kyus).

So my question is, how did I mess up all my thickness?

If black had lived with 3 corners and the right side, I think my prospects in this game look dull.

Any ideas on how to improve my Go?

ch: The problem in this game is the weakness of E15 group.
This and the thickness of the Q11 group strongly reduces the thickness of your bottom groups. It will be hard for white to attack anything or to build a moyo.
So, if black manages to live in the bottom right, he is ahead with territory.

You showed good reading skills in the game (that is why you finally won), and also direction of play was good.

I would avise to think harder about the weakness  of stones.
If you are in doubt about the security of one of your groups, in most cases it is better to invest another move (e.g. J16). 

If you have a weak group, avoid being cut (e11 is too far) 

Single stones with the potential to make a base (C14 or J3) or groups with a base are usually not weak. They are hard to attack.

If you attack, you should carefully think about direction, and if the exchanges are good or not.

If you have no idea how to play locally, it is good practice to play somewhere else.

I hope my comments may help a little,...

You are welcome. It was a pleasure.])
