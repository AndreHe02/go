C[J: Thank you for submitting this game.

My name is Joe, and I'm roughly 2d AGA.

I've prefixed all my comments with a "J:". Enjoy.];B[pp]C[I am playing black with time control of 1 minute + 10 minutes for every 25 moves on pandanet. my rank is 5kyu + against an opponent that is 4 kyu]

;W[hc]C[I was not expecting this move];B[cc]C[J: Moving into the corner is a good response. Your group is alive, and you threaten to take away white's left side.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[gc]C[J: After a cross-cut, you usually extend. But F17 isn't the correct stone to reinforce.

Your corner is secure, and white can not kill F17. G17 is the weak stone here, and extending from G17 would keep white separated. This would give you a fighting chance.]

(;B[ff]C[Getting some free moves

J: If you can't use these "free moves" then they would be best left for ko threats.

But these moves are welcomed by white, who gets to fix his shape. A solid group here will greatly help his Q17 corner.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[de];W[cf]C[Right here i realised I got a pretty bad exchangesince white has the left and the top side]
;B[hf]C[J: This is your biggest mistake in judgement this game. 

These stones weren't important. The 2 white groups they seperate are tough to pressure. 

By committing to these stones, you allow white to build territory on both the top and the side, while you will have difficulty getting any points from these stones. You're giving white a target to attack.]

;W[jh]C[J: White's territory is getting out of control. Meanwhile, you still need to worry about life.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[nh];W[qi];B[mf]C[this move was a misclick,, if i was white i definitely would have cut on o13. i was intendng on playing n13

J: R10 is the normal move here. R10 prevents white from pushing further on the right side, and also works well with Q4.

But white is ahead, so normal moves are hard to play.

Cutting creates complications. Its usually better to avoid complications when you have a lead, and create complications when you are behind. So I would prefer your mis-click over the move you wanted to play.]

(;W[me];B[ng];W[ne];B[kf];W[jf];B[ke];W[qq];B[pq]C[J: Right direction.

Since you omitted R10 earlier, its hard for either player to get points on the right.]

J: If you don't have a follow-up, forcing moves are usually best left as ko threats.]

J: Your game was lost when you committed to the G14 group. After that, white played a very safe game. If you had played elsewhere, you would have had more options for reducing or attacking white. 

Other than that, there were no serious mistakes. Once you realized you were behind, you should have also started seeking complications. You played a fairly calm game, which white was happy to go along with.]
