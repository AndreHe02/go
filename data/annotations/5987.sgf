;B[pd]C[RS:  I have put in my ideas and how I should have lost at move 161.  Let me know if my thinking is correct or not.  And I am interested in knowing things that you see that I completely missed.  Thanks in advance.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[po]C[I think you should react on this kakari, because the komoku needs stronger support than the corner.

Even if you play the double kakari white can tenuki and still live later.]

Your variations seems right

I stopped the review here, because the game would have been over now.
I think you are playing too complicated considering the reading skill i saw in this game.
Just play the simple way: "Don't try to trick your opponent"^^]
