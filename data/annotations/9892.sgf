PM[2]FG[259:];B[pc];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd]C[Hi. Some words to the review: I will try to focus my advice on strategy and general principles. You can improve a lot when you always have a strategic goals in mind. For the tactics you just have to play. Solving some tsumego is good, too.]

(;B[qe]LB[oq:A][ed:B][do:C]C[Ok, a corner enclosure is big. But this corner is less important. White's approach move at 'a' would work together with the white stone in the bottom left. In the same way you can play 5 at 'B' . I think this move is more natural to you than 'C'.]
;W[qg]
(;B[jc]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[White's invasion point is very bad. White played near by a strong position. An invasion at a or b would be no problem for White. But in this position you should play a pincer at once so that White can't easily get a base. You can easily get profit when your opponent has a weak group.
When you can prevent your opponent from getting a base or you can rob a base, this is usually much bigger than an extension like 7. Some strategy books call this moves 'urgent moves'.]
;W[qj];B[op]TR[qg][qj]LB[ql:A][oq:B]C[The marked white group is more or less stable. At least you cannot expect to kill this group with some moves. So we can say that the influence of a high corner enclosure has already been neutralized. Of course you can put some pressure on the white group with a move like A when you want to attack. Thats why i would play more solid on B than a high enclosure.]
;W[mq];B[ql];W[qn]LB[pm:A]C[A standard position. To catch the stone you have to play on A.]

(;B[om];W[pl];B[pm];W[qm];B[pk];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[qi]
;B[oh];W[nc]LB[pf:A]C[Whites group is now very strong. On the other hand your upper right corner comes in the focus. 
A is also a good point for you. You can confine the big white group to the side. I think such moves are underestimated among kyu players.]
;B[je];W[pf];B[oe];W[pe]LB[pd:A]C[You have to block at A. Other moves are too good for White.]
;B[me];W[pd];B[qd];W[od];B[ne];W[nb]C[I am not sure with 100%, but the corner looks pretty dead.]
;B[ec]LB[cj:A][ck:B][do:C]C[I think that is the wrong place. The left side has a lot of open space. More open space makes an invasion, here around at A or B, more attractive. Besides from the left side there is open space at the bottom, too. An approach move at C is also possible. 35 looks like a pure territory move. You should keep in mind that you have to try to expand the borders from your moyo after the big invasions are played.]

(;W[qa];B[qb];W[pa];B[ra];W[rb];B[rc];W[sb];B[pb];W[oa];B[sc]
;W[cg]LB[jq:A][do:B]C[I think that an invasion is much more important. White missed the chance to defend at A. Black on the other hand has a strong position. So black should not hesitate to invade at the bottom. Playing at B is also a good point.]

(;B[ef];W[hf]LB[eh:A]C[It looks like an overplay. Nevertheless it is not obvious how handle this invasion/reduction. As White i would play A instead of 48. But also for Black it is an important point to keep White just disconnected.]
;B[ig]TR[ec][ef]C[The marked group looks a little bit thin.]
;W[gg]LB[eh:A]C[A is still the important point. At first you should keep the white group disconnected.]
;B[ge]LB[eh:A]C[I think this not good. If White plays A now, it already a big success. Much of your moyo has been neutralized and your stones at the top are overconcentrated.]
;W[he];B[gd];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[jj]LB[kd:A]C[You have to block at A. This is very urgent. If White connects the White group to easily you can no profit from attacking.]
;W[lg];B[ke];W[of];B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg];B[oi];W[li]TR[gg]
[hd][he][hf][id][jd]C[Of course, White should save this group at first.]
;B[lj];W[jh];B[ih];W[kd];B[kg];W[lf];B[le];W[kf];B[jg];W[jf]
;B[if];W[ie];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[ki];B[kj];W[ld];B[ji];W[og]
;B[kh];W[ph];B[do]C[After this, I *horribly* misused my thickness. How should have I used it properly?

Speaking of this move, I'm not sure if high approach (actually, if *any* approach) to komoku stone was correct here.

You can keep it simple: In this situation the high approach is better because this move has a better connection to your thickness. Your thickness is something like a save harbour. With the help of thickness you can easily invade open positions.]
;W[gq];B[dl];W[cj]C[You have already destroyed at lot of potenzial on the left side. The group is not safe, but in an emergency you can escape to the center. So now i would invade the bottom at once. Fighting with backup is one variation of how to use thickness.]
;B[dj];W[eh];B[jo]C[You should invade on the third line. You have enough support nearby.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[im]C[And the massive invasion starts here...]
;B[in];W[gm];B[fn];W[hn];B[ho];W[hm];B[io]LB[jm:A]C[A is better]
;W[hk];B[hi]LB[jm:A][cq:B][iq:C][cb:D][lb:E]TR[hk][hn][gm][hm]
[im]C[How could I stop White from connecting here?

Remember the proverb "Make profit while attacking". With a like A you close one direction, on the other hand you make some center territory with same move. There are other big moves (B-E) You can just play this moves. Even if White just connects, White will just make a defense move but not much points.]
;W[fj]LB[di:A]C[I do not see a direct way to prevent the connection of the white group. In such situations you should look for forcing moves like A. Such a move can change the circumstances a lot. Please look at the variation.]

(;B[gj]TR[dj][dl][do][fn][gn]C[In the coming fight we see that the marked group is not perfectly save an alive. With this and the following moves your marked group just becomes weaker. Before you start a fight you should always consider to play some forcing moves to strengthen your group.]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[ek];B[fl];W[fm];B[el];W[em];B[dn];W[en];B[fo]
LB[dm:A]TR[fn][gn]C[The marked stones are not important and should be sacrificed. You should play at A to save the left side.]

I think that you save the corner but i do not think that you can save the center at the same time. Look at the variation.]

Study the concept of urgent moves. 
Don't attack to kill. Attack to play double-purpose moves. 
For example: Attack to make territory or influence. 
Make sure that your own groups are strong before you start an attack. 
Don't try to kill your opponent at all costs. Usually it's enough to chase him while you make some points. 
Don't answer your opponent blindly! Look always for the biggest move on the board.
It was an interesting game with big ups and downs on both sides.]
