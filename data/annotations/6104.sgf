C[Hello Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game =)

In this game, I played Black. I felt I played pretty well until near the end, where I lost a series of fights and lost.

Please give me any specific feedback you have, as well as what general areas/skills I should improve on. My opponent also requested a copy of the review, so any comments for him would be great too =)

Thank You!

- Derek


Hello Derek

I'll be reviewing this game. I'll start off my comments with a K: to distinguish them from your comments.

- Kamber];B[pd];W[cp];B[qo];W[dc]TR[qo][cp]C[K: At this point, you have two stones that are high in relation to the bottom side. One of them is even on the fifth line. That means that the bottom side is very important to both of you because you both have a lot to gain from taking it.]
;B[pq]C[K: And even more so now that black has an enclosure pointing towards the bottom side.]
;W[qj]C[K: And for that reason, this play should have been at the bottom. There's not much white can gain at this side compared to the bottom. The left side and top are also open still.]
;B[ep]C[K: Making a move in the bottom was a smart move. I think I'd have played it closer to the enclosement though. I'm not sure who'd come out on top if white had pincered here.]
;W[dq];B[eq]C[Is this a good response?

K: Very good. It creates a strong position in the bottom.];W[cn]

(;B[jq]C[K: And this seals an incredibly strong position for black. I might have played it on the fourth line though. This seems a bit too protective.]
;W[np];B[ce];W[bd];B[ch];W[dj];B[bj]LB[mc:A][qg:B][ql:C]C[Was this play necessary, or should I  have just played elsewhere?

K: A play to secure the group was neccesary. But did you consider running instead? There's a whole open middle for you. White has strong positions on both sides, and can force you to live small.]
;W[cl];B[qg];W[qm];B[mq];W[nq]CR[pn][oo]TR[qj][qm][np]C[K: There's a proverb that says that you should never create two weak groups. The strain of protecting them both can give your opponent a large advantage, and if you're unlucky, he might even be able to attack both at once.

If black moves to split O3 and R7, white will have two weak groups, and he'll be very busy indeed.

That move, along with the open top, is probably the most important thing in the game now.]
;B[mr];W[er];B[fr];W[cr];B[gq];W[nr];B[am]TR[on]C[I knew I could cut here, but I felt there was a huge opening at A7, so I played there instead.

K: A7 isn't huge at all. In fact, it's very minor. It threatens to take away less than 10 points with another move, and there's no threat to the white groups health at all since it has eyespace and free access to the middle.

In fact, white should have ignored it and prevented the cut in the lower right, or made a move in the open top. That would be worth much more than black could gain on the left.]
;W[bk];B[ak];W[bl];B[al];W[an];B[bn]C[Stupid mistake.];W[bm]
;B[aj];W[bo];B[jc]C[K: About time someone made a move in the top.]
;W[qc]LB[jc:A][qg:B]C[I played the following sequence the way I did because I wanted to make thickness towards A, since there's more moyo there than B.

K: Good thinking];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[oc]
;W[qb]TR[re]SQ[rd]C[K: This is a very weak group. White needs to extend in the other direction too, with a move like S15.

If black plays S16, white is in trouble. I'm no master of life and death, but I don't think white can survive it (as indeed he doesn't later on when the move is played)]

(;B[gc];W[fb];B[gb];W[cd];B[fc];W[eb];B[be];W[dh];B[ri]C[Was this move too small?

K: It cuts into the base of whites group, which makes your upcoming cut that much more dangerous. And white can't ignore it unless he wants to run, so no, I don't think it's too small.]
;W[rj];B[on]CR[pn][oo]C[K: And here comes the cut. Now things get interesting.

I think a knights move is too risky though. The weak link to blacks corner group is a serious weakness. I'd have started the cut with Q6 or P5. It might not look as impressive, but the threatening cut at R6 is an incredible weakness in blacks position that ends up influencing the whole fight.]
;W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[nn];W[mp]C[K: Black's playing a high-stakes game here by forcing white into his own territory, particularly with that cut at R6 still available.

Starting a fight like this can lose you the game if you fail to kill.

Instead of risking everything to try and kill, black should force white upwards. That has two advantages:

- Blacks bottom group gets larger.

- Black ends up fighting on top of whites OTHER weak group. That way, white ends up fighting for two weak groups at once. That's a recipe for disaster.

See variation]
(;B[ln];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[in];W[hp];B[hq];W[go]TR[in][ln]
[nn][on][pn]C[My next move was also a stupid mistake. I was planning on cutting at A, but the next move killed my plan.

K: I think the biggest mistake is that you're still trying to kill. While you have lost a great deal in the bottom, you've gained a wall in return. I'd close the gap at R6 and get ready attack R10. See second variation.]

(;B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[gp];B[jo];W[ip];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq]
(;W[jn]TR[mo]C[K: I don't know about this. I think N5 is a better move. See variation]
;B[mo];W[ko];B[jm];W[eo];B[kn];W[qn]C[Would this variation would have been better? I didn't realize there was  a threat yet.

K: Yes, I think it would.]

;B[os];W[ps];B[rd];W[pa];B[ra]C[K: Nice];W[iq];B[ir];W[fp];B[fq]
;W[bi]C[Didn't see that comming at all.

K: That's a clever tesuji by white here.];B[ai];W[ah];B[bh]
;W[cj];B[ag];W[ai];B[ee];W[af];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[ag];B[di]
C[K: I think you should've just cut your losses here and gotten out. You still have the attack on whites R10 that'll put you ahead of the game.]
;W[ei];B[ci];W[dg];B[cf];W[de];B[df];W[ae];B[ef];W[eh];B[jf]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[nh];B[nf]C[K: Black shouldn't be the one playing defensively now. It's backward. There's black strength on both sides, use it to secure your top group while white is busy defending, or use it to expand your territory, but remember that you are the one in charge in a position like this.

When black plays like this, white gets a lot more than he's really entitled to. He gets a good shot at reducing blacks top territory,and he gets to seriously threaten blacks group in the bottom middle.]
;W[lg];B[lf]C[K: A good thing to remember: contact moves are almost always a bad way to attack or defend. Unless you want to settle a position quickly, don't ever use them. You'll see why in a moment when white uses this to his advantage.]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[gf];B[lh]C[K: And another contact move.];W[kg]
;B[jg];W[mg];B[mh];W[kf]C[Not sure how I should have responded to this.

K: You're hampered by those contact moves. They give white an advantage right from the start because there's so many ways to exploit them. It's going to be almost impossible to stop white from pushing into your territory.]

(;B[ke];W[mf];B[le];W[me]TR[kh]C[K: By this time, black should be thinking about connecting some of his stones. There's way too many holes in this position.

A move like L12 to connect blacks lower groups to the rest looks appropriate. See variation]

;B[je];W[he];B[oe];W[ng];B[og];W[oh];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj];W[oj]

;W[ok];B[pl];W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[nl];B[nk];W[ml];B[nj]

;W[fm];B[hm];W[no];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[ll];B[km];W[mi]TR[lj]
[il]C[I didn't see that one comming either.

K: I'm not so sure this is actually a good move by white. Blacks group is open in the top and the O3 group is pushing in. Instead of making small moves like this, white should be eating away blacks eyespace. Moves like M10 or J8 threaten the whole black group, and are the ones black ought to be scared of.]
;B[ki];W[mj];B[lk];W[mk];B[kk];W[ii];B[ij];W[gi];B[hj];W[fi]
;B[fl]C[K: Now black's pretty much secure in the middle. Considering the strong attacking position white had, that's a good result for black. Sacrificing those 3 stones was a small price to pay for saving almost 30]
;W[em];B[sj];W[sk];B[si];W[rk];B[if];W[ge];B[hi];W[hh];B[gg]
;W[fg];B[fd];W[dd];B[sm]C[K: I'd spend this move securing the bottom group instead. A move like E1 could help a lot in that regard.]
;W[rn];B[sn];W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[rl];W[qk];B[so];W[qs];B[rs]
;W[sq]C[K: This move by white makes no sense. It's a waste of a ko threat, and it achieves nothing whatsoever.]
;B[sr];W[ks];B[jr]TR[kr]C[K: I think L2 would have made a better defense.]
;W[lr];B[gs];W[es];B[fs]TR[hr]C[K: Should have been H2];W[js]
C[Here I resign.

Thank you again,

- Derek


K: Apart from the technical stuff, I think the two big things that won white this game are that black attacked the white group in the bottom wrong, destroying the large strong bottom he had built up, and that he failed to exploit the weak white group on the right. Black got off to a very good start, but these two mistakes allowed white to catch up and gain the upper hand in the late-game fighting.]

;B[oi]TR[qj][rj][qm]C[K: Now white will have a hard time running or a hard time living. And blacks moyo in the top is a game-winner that white can't afford to invade because he still has those two weak groups he needs to secure (not to mention that the upper right is still not secure)]
))
(;B[lp];W[lq];B[lr];W[lo];B[kp];W[mo];B[ko]C[K: This would probably lead to a more favorable fight for black. White eats away a good bit of blacks territory, but again, that's neccesary because otherwise blacks weak link at R6 would allow white to connect his groups.]
