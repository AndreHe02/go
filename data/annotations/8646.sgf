C[N: I play as Numsgil (3k) on KGS.  I prefaced my comments with N.  Basic takeaway: your strategy and opening is okay but your life and death skills are getting you in to trouble.]
;B[pd]C[Thank you for reviewing, this is my first time submitting.

I'm xPillow and I play black, I play on KGS. I'm not really sure where my real rank lies, I picked up Go in the summer and started playing for a few months and stopped for a few months. Left off at 11k, but then KGS exprapolated me to 9k when i returned >.<. now I just play free games occasionally.

I don't have anyone teaching me or reviewing for me ever :( starting to feel the need for feedback. so please leave as much insight as possible. I leave you with some of my own thought processes. would be nice to know if I'm on the right track.

N: If the people you beat months ago improve in rank it helps improve your own rank.  Since people in the double digit kyu range tend to improve very quickly it's not at all uncommon for your own rank to sort of get swept up along for the ride.

N: You might also visit the go forum at http://lifein19x19.com  It's easy to ask questions and get pretty good responses.  And of course Sensei's Library (http://senseis.xmp.net/) has some good articles.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]TR[nc]SQ[qf]C[I started with Chinese opening, because my go rival always uses it. and i figure if i play it myself i'll get a better feel of how to attack it. not my usual opening, so i'm slightly uncomfortable. Tips on how to attack a low chinese opening would be appreciated.

N: The low chinese aims at a moyo (less so than the high one, but still...)  So the idea is to make it so big that white has to invade.  Then you force white to live in one part while you solidify the other part in to solid territory.  For white, he can counter that strategy if he can get stable groups near the border of black's moyo or if he builds his own moyo.  The main thing is not to invade into the right side until later in the game.  And not to feel intimidated by it (it feels like a really sophisticated opening, but that doesn't mean your opponent will be sophisticated in their use of it).]
;W[dj]C[N: This is fine.  He builds his own moyo in response.]
;B[fq]C[N: I might prefer the top since your corner stone on the bottom is low (it's on the 3rd line from this perspective).  Chinese opening means playing for moyo, and the 4-4 stone better supports that goal.]
;W[cm]TR[fp]SQ[cn]C[Big keima? is this appropriate?

N: A pincer would be more normal.  Attaching at triangle is also good.  The problem with the large jump here is that it doesn't protect the corner enough, and the side isn't as secure as it looks (believe it or not 8 at square actually makes better shape along the side.  Often the symmetric move isn't good because it's too loose.  Better to securely control one side or the other).  But if he played square I'd argue that white is too concencentrated on the left side.  So this is a pretty mediocre move.  But it also punishes itself so don't feel like you have to do something here to punish white yourself.]
;B[iq]TR[jp]SQ[hq]CR[eq]MA[fp]C[I responded with J3 instead of the usual D2. Felt like D2/C3 exchange would just make his big keima effective. later i will invade with 3-3 point? what would be the usual response here.

N: If you want to leave the 3-3 invasion open you should play at triangle.  It forms a loose shape.  If white tries to invade it at square, you play above him on the 4th line and push him along the 3rd line.  He gets territory, but you get influence that works well with your moyo strategy.  It's good for black in the opening.  You could also jump into the corner at the 3-3 if you don't think the influence will be useful.

N: If you play the two space extension on the side here, though, you _need_ to make the D2/C3 exchange first.  If you don't, white will kick you at circle, and if you stand up then, your black 9 stone is too close to the wall and you end up overconcentrated.  If you tenuki after white circle, white will wrap around you at X and the influence white has built up will be really good, especially with his large keima.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qh]CR[qe]C[N: It's better to kick at circle.  See the variation.]
;W[of]CR[qc]C[N: White should jump into the corner at circle.  (Don't worry if you don't know how to live in the 3-3 just yet.  Try it a few times in games and then look up variations you can't figure out on Sensei's library or you can ask questions on that lifein19x19 forums).

N: The problem here is that white has a weak group and black is pretty strong all around.  Black should be able to force white to run (making no points in the process) while black builds up territory along the top.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc]C[Personally not very familiar with jokeseis >.< I'm just winging it here.

N: You're doing fine.  White loses aji when he slides in like this.  You get a solid half corner and white's group still isn't alive.]
;B[fc]CR[rb]C[defending the corner seems kind of small? is tenuki correct?

N: Defending the corner is small if you are both alive.  Black's group is pretty alive, but white's group sure isn't!  Circle may feel small but it forces white to run some more, which is what you want (white is doing everything black wanted him to when he played the chinese).]
;W[hc]CR[fe]C[this makes me feel like maybe F17 wasnt such a good idea

N: This is not bad for black (not bad for white either).  Either jumping in to the corner or extending to circle are good ideas here.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[fg]CR[id]C[in my mind i was thinking "strengthen before attacking" too soon to play K17 or L17.

N: If your goal is to form a whole board running battle this isn't a bad play.  The normal joseki play is actually at circle, though.  The idea is that you push white along the 3rd line and build up 4th line influence.  Given that white still has a weak group on the left, influence isn't bad here.]
;W[eh]CR[jc][kc]C[not sure how to respond. F12 or steal base? his move seemed too close to me for comfort

N: White thinks he's sealing off the left side but he's actually leaving a lot of space for an invasion.  It's tricky to invade, though, so you'll see a lot of this sort of thing at low SDK/DDK ranges, since the opponents don't know how to exploit it.

N: All that's for later, though.  Right now, play either of the circle moves you were thinking before.  Black 21 isn't exactly a pivotal stone.  You don't really care if white makes another move against it or not.  You can always just let it die if you need to.]
;B[kc];W[he];B[hh]CR[hg]SQ[gf]TR[gh]C[N: Good.  Circle is a common attack move (called a "cap"), but white's peep at square would be hard to contain so that might not work here.  The diagonal move at triangle is another possibility, though it's pretty lax.  Playing square yourself might be interesting, too.]
;W[jf];B[mf]SQ[nf]C[split?

N: Yes.  White has two weak groups now.  If you don't think the right group is weak, you could also consider attaching to it as a "leaning attack".  eg: at square.  White defends, you defend, etc. (the exact sequences sprial out of control pretty fast, but as long as you have an idea of what you're trying to accomplish it's hard to go too wrong) and you build a wall facing down the left side at white's other group.  But only do that if white is already strong (he isn't here).]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[cc]TR[fg]CR[jh]SQ[mh]C[looking at the board, wasnt quite sure where to play. seal K16 group in? extend N14 to more effectively split? territory grab in lower right with r5 or N4/5?

in hindsight i regret this 3-3 invasion. the threat of the d16 group connecting to h17 group made things more difficult for me. locally i should have gone d18 or something?

N: The problem is that you still have a weak group (your triangle stones from the attack).  My number one pick is the cap at circle.  It helps your weak stones and threatens to kill/seal white's other group entirely.  If white runs, then you can make your other idea work by playing at square.  (This sort of 1-2-3 exchange is called an "inducing move".  You can sometimes make your opponent make you make the move you wanted to make anyway (a mouthful!))

N: By makign the 3-3 invasion, you're creating a new weak group.  You can take the corner, but not without damaging the triangle group.  Suddenly the attacker is the attackee.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[gb]C[N: The folly becomes painfully apparent here.  White can kill your corner now.]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[da]CR[fd]C[N: Imagine a white play at circle.  He'd probably get the corner and the bottom and connect up his groups.]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[gd]C[F16 or G16?];W[hd];B[po]TR[bd]C[N: Your corner still isn't alive.  White can kill simply and cleanly with a hane-and-connect at triangle.  Even if it was alive, it's better to attack white's weak group on the top then take territory.  General rule of thumb is that if your opponent has two weak groups you should probably be playing around where they are :)]
;W[mp]CR[mn]C[played high... should be a reduction attempt?

N: White doesn't want you to have everything here.  Problem is that he's making a third weak group.  Can you find a way to attack this stone in such a way that you build up strength facing white's other weak stones?  (hint: it's circle)]
;B[jo]CR[kj][lh][mi][nj][kk][jj][ji][ki][li][lj][mj][mk][lk]
[nk]C[maybe unorthodox but i try to cut his new stone off from other white groups

N: You force white to run in to an area that you were trying to build a moyo in.  Though it does make sense if you plan on inducing white to let you play a move around circle.]
;W[mn];B[mh]CR[jh]C[N: Not bad, but feels a little lax.  Again, circle probably induces white to let you play this move anyway.]
;W[jh];B[ij];W[ge];B[fd];W[gf];B[ff]CR[ee]TR[eg]SQ[dg]C[N: Force at circle first.  If white ignores you capture 6 stones and connect to your not quite alive corner.  After white responds, you can play triangle.  If white tries to push through then, you can wreck the left side by continuing on to square.]
;W[gg];B[fh];W[gh];B[fi]C[he keeps pushing from behind for a while... where should i have stopped? i was afraid for my group's life if i stopped extending, but as it goes on the white group becomes more irritating...

N: When you get this far, you don't have a lot of choice, no.  But you're building up thickness facing the left side.  It's looking pretty open right about now, yeah?  I'd call that a successful attack.  You forced white to hurt his left side.]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[dl];B[il]TR[gl]C[fearing for the two middle stones

N: Let em die.  White gets a slow and agonizing life for one of his three weak groups in the center.  You can attack the other two weak groups still.  But first your left black group still doesn't have eyes.  Triangle is a powerful move.  White probably has to respond, and you end up almost connected to the bottom.]
;W[gl];B[fm]
(;W[gm]C[xPillow [9k?\]: ?];B[gn];W[hn];B[go];W[im];B[jm]C[he moves to cut me/connect himself. not sure if i could stop him

N: No, probably not.  But let him live and kill of the two white stones on the right.]
;W[jn];B[km]C[N: You need to atari.  It's no good to let white connect.]
;W[kn];B[lo]C[i decide to fight here though it may be unsound...

N: It's pretty thin.  But the damage is pretty well done at this point.]
;W[ln];B[mo];W[ko];B[lp];W[kp];B[lq];W[kq];B[no];W[nn];B[on]
C[is this move more important or ensuring my middle group gets out?

N: Your middle group is still pretty light.  And if white gets to go here the aji is pretty unbearable for you.  So I think this is fine.]
;W[nl]C[i feel like this move by the opponent might be better spent at m11 or n9. try and either seal in my middle or connect the upper right white group.

N: White doesn't have a really compelling attack against the black stones (at least not that I see).  This move is probably as fine as anything else.  It lets black squirm out, but white gets to probably hurt black's territory on the right.]
;B[lj];W[oh];B[oj]TR[pg]C[maybe unecessary to split? upper right may be safely alive... im not sure. it can either go s13 or s18 access corner? the big dragon-esqe white group ive given up on hopes to kill...

N: This is a fine idea I think.  I might be tempted to play triangle and brute force a cut, too.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[pj];W[nk];B[rg]TR[rb]C[is this important? can i threaten his life or is it just a sente end game move? idk... is it endgame yet or is there still unresolved fighting x.x....

N: right idea but triangle is better.  It's too easy to make eyes in the corner.]
;W[rf];B[be]C[i thought i could make something happen in the c12 region, split/reduce the opponent somehow.

im a very slow player and from here on out im out of time and making very quick (and often bad) decisions.

N: Saving your stones from a horrible and painful death seems like an okay idea here (I _think_ this makes them live.]
;W[bf];B[bd]TR[ad]CR[ae]C[N: Hanging connection at triangle is more usual.  This move... has problems :)]
;W[ab]
(;B[ac]C[correct? doesnt seem like the usual blocky six response... which i think would be b18... but that seems to fail.

ran out of time o.o......................... lost anyway.

on a side note do you think I'm sdk or ddk level? im highly inconsistent, spending time reading other people's go reviews and doing problems than actually playing myself.

Thanks again for reviewing.

N: It's hard to know your level to any degree of accuracy.  On the SDK/DDK border probably.  You're still missing some key life and death bits (like the upper left and upper right corners.  And the middle dragon.  Dragons need eyes too, you know!) and that's probably holding you back more than anything else.  Unfortunately the only real way to get better at that is problems.  Problems until you can't stand to do more problems and you decide to take up golf instead :P]
