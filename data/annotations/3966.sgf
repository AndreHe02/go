AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Degan:  I played black in this game with a four handicap.  I feel like especially given the handicap I had in this game, I should have done a better job.  How could I have better utilized my handicap, and what mistakes did I make that I could have avoided?  I have made some comments through the game where I recall what I was thinking, and to ask questions.

Hi Eric, This is my first review for GTL. I have been looking forward to getting a review request. Thank you for your comments.]

(;B[pr]CR[pn]C[Degan: Maybe Q6 would be better?

Q6 is definitely better.

q6 is still the best move.]

you should worry about the cut at e10

so close. you had the possibility to win throughout the game. looks like a good choice for review.  I hope that What I wrote can be of some help to you. Good luck in the future.]
