Hi. I will comment this game for White.

Some general comments and advice:
- try to see the big picture and not get entangled in small fights;
- attack from a larger scale, not to kill, but to reinforce you while putting pressure on your opponent;
- play the big moves.

You also need some practise with fighting and with life-and-death problems (tsumego) as everyone does ^^ but first I would focus on the big picture. If you can build safer moyos, with less invasion opportunities for your opponent, you will have less fights to do at the same time, and your fight will lead to better results. Fighting skills and reading skills come with practise, so play go more and more and you'll improve naturally ;)]

Usual answers to Black F3 include White D6 or C6. Thanks to your stone at D10, D6 would be great, as it would help you build a nice moyo. Instead, O17 creates a weakness in your framework. Indeed, even if Black takes the time to answer around Q13, he will still have the opportunity to either pincer around M17 or to invade the bottom left corner.

Trying to extend your moyo on the upper side is not a bad idea though. But because of what I said, you could consider a less aggressive expansion around K16.]
;B[iq]C[----
Black stays quite low on the bottom.];W[id];B[qo];W[kg]MA[dn]
[qc][qf]C[----
This is a bit premature. Your sides are still quite weak, especially the left side, and you're already aiming at the middle. Remember that there is much fewer points in the center than in the sides. For the same reason you could consider an invasion at R17 or around the upper right side, although I think D6 is definitely better here.]
;B[dd];W[cd]C[----
Good direction, as it will push Black against your stones on the right, and L13 might actually prove to be useful in a fight.]
;B[fd];W[ed]MA[df]C[----
This is too aggressive. When Black invades, your first reaction should not be : how do I kill Black? But : how do I prevent Black from getting too big while reinforcing my position to get bigger myself? This is why instead of trying to cut Black (which also weakens you) you should consider a play around D14. D14 would reinforce your moyo on the left, Black will have to run to the center or to the right, but your stones on the right will give him some trouble.]
;B[ee];W[ec];B[ge];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[fc];W[fb]SQ[eb]MA[cf]
[dc]C[----
This leaves a weakness at E18. Moreover, at this point of the game it is more important to reinforce your moyo than to get a few more points on the lower lines. If you really want to strengthen this direction, D17 is better as it leaves no weakness, whereas now your group at C16 is weak. Strengthening this group would be important to have a strong base in the corner, that you could try and extend in the direction of D10.]
;B[eb]C[----
Black takes advantage of your weakness right away and your stone at F18 doesn't look very useful anymore.]
;W[fe]C[----
I guess you already realized this was an easy mistake ;) Note that after Black captures F15, he almost have a ponnuki, which is worth a lot as his stones radiate in all directions (well except to the top in this particular game).]
;B[ff]MA[ee][fd][ge]C[----
Here is the almost-ponnuki.];W[gb]MA[cf][dc][dn][fo][hc][ne]
C[----
This play does not block Black: he can continue at H17. If you want to block Black you should play moves such as H17. If your intention was to kill Black, this is hopeless as he can run at H17 until you give up, and then kill your group at E17. Anyway, there are bigger moves such as D6 or D14. O15 would help you build a moyo and prevent Black from joining his groups. F5 is also a possibility to keep Black low on the lower side.]
;B[dc];W[db]C[----
This is a common mistake. Black can answer C18 and capture your stone, making your move useless.]
;B[hc];W[ea];B[hb];W[ec];B[kc];W[ic]MA[cf][dn][pf][qc]C[----
Black L17 achieves several things:
- it puts pressure on your group at H16,
- it pincers your stone at O17 somehow (although your stone at L13 will help you if you run to the center),
- it is an invasion that threaten to divide your moyo.

So the fight on the left has really weakened you because you tried to kill instead of trying to reinforce yourself. Now you have to:
- somehow make use of the stones at O17 and O13 (possibly with R17 or around R14),
- save your group at H16,
- strengthen your moyo on the left,
- prevent black from using his newly gained strength in the upper left corner to divide you on the left side.

Most likely you cannot do all this, of course, so you will have to choose what's the most important. But Black also has weaknesses you can exploit:
- his group in the upper left corner is not settled, it needs more space,
- you can still invade the upper right corner or split the right side.
The first weakness can be exploited to strengthen your left side by chasing Black on a LARGE scale (not by fighting). The invasion on the right could help you establish a base, taking advantage or your stone at O17.

Having all that in mind, J17 does not seem to be so great: it will only strengthen Black. Instead, consider something such as:
- C14 or D14 which strengthens your side but does not put that much pressure on Black (although it prevents an invasion which would settle him),
- Q14 which should allow you to split Black and help your stones but will lead to a complicated fight,
- R17 which should help you, along with O17, to have a base in the corner (but Black will most likely have a wall which will help him a lot in the upper center so this is maybe not a good idea),
- D6 which is very important.];B[ib];W[jb]C[----
This actually helps Black, as you invite him to cut at K17, which:
- strengthens his stone at L17,
- cuts you and most likely kill the stone you just played at K18,
- continues the attack on your L group at J16.

Although for Black, cutting at K17 is not the only option IMO (for instance J14 attacks your group on a larger scale while reinforcing his group on the left).]
;B[jc];W[ld]C[----
If you want to save your L group, this is too far away. J14 would be safer, although it is likely to reinforce Black's position as he will chase you.]
;B[dm]C[----
Now it is too late for D6 and you have even more weaknesses as you have more groups to care about.

Notice how your stones are all split and do not really communicate, whereas the Black stones still form a moyo on the bottom and on the right.]
;W[dl]C[----
This contact play invites Black to play E7 to reinforce himself.]
;B[je];W[jd]C[----
This move eventually substracts one liberty from your L group. It had 3 liberties before, and now you invite Black to play L16, leaving you with only 2 liberties. You should focus on the other parts of the board, because right now, your group is dead. You can still use it as a threat though... as long as you don't force Black to capture it as you are doing with K16.]
;B[kd];W[ie]C[----
With more practise you will be able to read these moves and see that your group is already dead.]
;B[jf]C[----
Black J14 would kill the White group instantly. Well, this works too.]
;W[ke];B[if];W[lc];B[kb];W[de]C[----
I already pointed out C14 several times, but your move here at D15 is good too, although it will weaken your stones around E17 as Black is invited to answer E16.]
;B[lb];W[ed]C[----
Another possibility here would be to play D14 and aim at joining your stones on the bottom. Your choice is not bad though compared to D14.]
;B[em]C[----
Your move at D8 was most likely to be answered this way, I was surprised this didn't happen sooner :) Notice how Black is nicely strenghened with this move here - keep that in mind when you play contact moves such as D8.]
;W[ef];B[cm]C[----
Black splits even more, making your stone at D4 very, very lonely, and reducing your territory on the left a lot.]
;W[fe]C[----
Taking one stone is not important (remember that Black can capture your group at J16, or K18, with only one play, so you cannot capture his group). Try to focus on bigger moves, especially around the lower left and the upper right.]
;B[cl]C[----
This is quite slow from Black who could have prefered:
- a play around Q14 to prevent you from invading or splitting here,
- a play around the center to frame a bigger moyo,
- a play around F5 to make your stone even more lonely,
- a play around F9 to reduce your extension possibilities, while framing a bigger moyo.]
;W[ha]C[----
This move only forces Black to capture, so it is not really important, and Black will have less weaknesses for you to exploit in the end-game. Try to find bigger moves. This remark is valid for many other plays from here but I will stop repeating it :)]
;B[ee];W[ja];B[ck];W[fe];B[he];W[gf];B[fg];W[cj]C[----
Good.];B[gg];W[eh];B[bp];W[eg]C[----
Not really urgent. You still have one big point to take at R17 or Q14/R14. (Your stone at D4 is better left dead for now - you may be able to use it later when fighting for the middle).]
;B[cq];W[ei]C[----
Too slow again.];B[pf]C[----
A big play for Black.];W[bj]C[----
Again too slow. Your wall is beautiful and very strong but does not encloses as much territory as Black's scarcer plays on the right.]
;B[oc];W[aj]C[----
Very, very slow: moves on the first lines should be kept for the very end. Moreover, you could have played at A7 if you wanted to play on the first line.]

Do not try to finish your territory in the middle game while there are some space left in the center or anywhere else.

You are lost now because your stones on the upper right quarter and the lower left quarter are almost hopeless anyway. You can not gain any more substantial territory here. The only thing you can do is to prevent Black from making too much territory himself, especially in the center. See how the board is empty between E10 and O3: this is where things will take place now (the marked area is to be contested). Your stone at L13 can still help for this purpose.]
;B[md];W[ee]C[----
Very, very, very slow. It is only worth half a point.];B[mi]
C[----
This, on the opposite, is big as it helps Black to form a bigger moyo, which is what you should prevent. The same remark is true for your other moves from here.]
;W[ia];B[ki];W[mc];B[nd];W[mb];B[hk]C[----
See how you let Black have this big moyo. 2 of his last 3 stones at H9, L11 and N11 could have been White! :)]

You can not hope to save this group:
- you have no space to make 2 eyes,
- it cannot connect to any living group (any group at all actually),
- it cannot capture any Black group to make space for living.]

This actually helps Black to capture you as you now have only one liberty left at N15. He would have captured anyway, so you're giving him one free point.]
