(;B[oc]C[Can white just leave C15 like that? I wasn't sure how to take advantage of it, so I played it safe and enclosed the other corner.

Hey it's very easy to take advantage. White won't leave this stone withouth a fight, and this fight is in your favour]
;W[jc];B[hc]C[Upper left corner seemed more vulnerable than upper right corner, so H17 instead of M17

correct];W[mc];B[qg]C[Cowardice move~! Should be played at r10!

(;B[qn]LB[je:E][ne:F][dh:D][qk:G][cn:C][fq:B][nq:A]C[This stone is just asking for R8, probably not such a great idea, right?

Heh, you are right, now just need to find it out before you play move.

Other ideas A-F

A-B "Play from the wider space" It's basics, to choose direction where is more space.

C is just asking for pincer wchich would be also extension from c15, it isn't great idea.

D is urgent and still should be played first

E, F - two stones extension doesn't grant life. You can take those moves in sente.

C[P4 group looks almost-catchable but not really (one failed sequenced as variation). I first wanted the corner to live (perhaps as side if white slides into it), and Q6 group to cause some damage to white. I was undecided between letting it go, and strengthening it by harrassing P4, and hoping for connection to live black stones, perhaps at R13. R11-R8 look less strong than they used to, now that the fight is going on nearby.

k43r: You can't catch those stones, right? First thing is that you should have ridden this 2 moves ago and don't do this mistake. Secound thing, is that it's very bad to fight with two weak groups. This fight in corner have strenghten white r11-r8 stones, they are 100% alive, and there is no way to attack them.  You can sacrifive q6 group, and build something on lower side. For example var. A.]

Trying to save O9 now looks like a sure way to lose by points even if it works. F3 is the biggest move right? Or something around D13? P13/C10/C6 I didn't like for various reasons.

This isn't great move. 
1. Attack from wider space
2. Play away from strenght

c6 is more interesting
d12 is great];W[pm]C[That seemed like a completely wasted move by white - I felt back in game. I'm not really sure how to take advantage of lone stones like D4 / C15.

(;B[nr]C[Good];W[jr]TR[pr][sr]C[White cuts instead. Assuming the corner lives (what doesn't seem as obvious retrospectively as it was during the game, slide around T2 could steal a lot of eyespace even if not yet, especially with Q2 cut. I decided that the corner must live by proof by contradiction. If the corner dies I lost the game anyway, therefore corner lives, ugly as it looks. Now it's time to make White cut contained in insufficient eyespace.]

(;B[hr]TR[hq][iq]C[H3/J3 better? H2 looked better at limiting white eyespace and worse at shutting white in than these two.

Major mistakes:
1. Not attacking c15
2. Failure at lower side
3. Failure at left side
4. Reading mistake at b12
5. Not killing right side

Only 12 points loss, and every of this mistakes was worth at least 20 points. Your opp crushed you in middle game even tough he played 5 pass moves until endgame! Fastest and easiest way to improve your middlegame is to do some tsumego. Sounds boring but it works.

Other idea is to watch gtl reviews of ppl couple stone stronger than you to get fighting ideas.

Playing high handicap games as black might help you as well.

You've made two 25k moves. Never fill out for dame if there is need to - you've seen consequences at left side. D7 move was 25k mistake, and there is nothing more to say.

Hope it helps you ^^
