;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[mq]LB[op:A][oq:B][nq:C][kq:D]C[bridges: I don't like this. It's far from the R4 stone, so it doesn't really enclose the corner, but not far enough to be a nice extension from the corner. A, B, and C are all better corner enclosures, while D is a better extension.   Black now has weaknesses at A and B that white can aim for later if black doesn't repair them. White might think about developing thickness facing that area as a prelude to attacking. Something as simple as an extension near the bottom star point, for example, could be a precursor to a later attack.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[bridges: Although hane-ing at the head of two stones is the proverb, you can't follow it blindly. In this case, white is invading after the pincer to get a more favorable invasion result. The white stone has aji that makes it bad for black to hane here. Black should let him invade, and take the thickness and sente.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[od];B[oe];W[nd]C[bridges: black needs to connect at Q15.]
;B[nc];W[pe];B[qe]C[bridges: Note, this just reduces black own liberties, not something you want to do in a close
contact fight like this.];W[pf];B[rf];W[rg];B[rh];W[sd];B[md]
;W[ne];B[me];W[nf];B[ic];W[dj]
(;B[mo]LB[qk:A]C[bridges: This does increase the size of black's bottom right, and reinforce the connection to the R4 stone. However, it seems premature while there are still big points on side, and open approaces to white's two corners. White, however, should be looking to do something to reduce or invade the right side. Because of the thickness he has at the top and the now relative weakness of the S12/R12 stones, perhaps white could consider an invasion near A.]

(;W[mf];B[ke];W[fc]C[bridges: A fairly large move for white, because it prevents black from playing here. At the moment, though, the bottom left would be a big extension or approach for black.]
;B[cf]
(;W[cd]C[bridges: This is a little too easy on the black stone. It lets black jump out and attempt to seal white into the corner.  C15 puts more pressure on the black stone.]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh];B[eg]C[bridges: Now black is relatively settled and can try and seal white in the top left corner]
;W[fj];B[pl];W[gp]C[bridges: This gives black an easy extension to J3 that threatens to undercut the white corner.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[do];W[cn];B[dr]
(;W[ep]C[bridges: Ugh. What's the danger here? Why make this ugly empty triangle? G4 would be more help if it was as G3, but this is incredibly timid. Emptry triangles aren't always bad, but when you find yourself about to make one, that should be a warning to think if there is a better move. There may not be, and the empty triangle may end up being the right move, but most times, it isn't.]
;B[er];W[en]C[bridges: Yes staying connected is important, but white let the cutting stone scare himtoo much, and as a result let black leak out of the bottom of his corner.]
;B[oi]C[bridges: Black is building an enormous right side. White needs to do *something* ASAP, but by this point it's a tough proposition.]
;W[mh]C[bridges: This just helps black build his bottom right.]
;B[mj];W[kh]C[bridges: And this makes black connect his left side and top side groups, effectively sealing white into the UL corner.]
;B[he];W[fe];B[fg];W[gh];B[gf];W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[bj];W[bk]
;B[aj];W[cg]C[bridges: interesting, but it doesn't quite work here.]

;B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[jn];B[im]C[bridges: For the price of one stone, white is inviting black to walk into his potential middle territory.]

;B[mc];W[oo];B[pn];W[po];B[qo];W[on];B[pm];W[mn]C[bridges: white doesn't have any real eye space here at all, and black can always connect under at P1. Better to atari at N7, and then either take or connect at P1 once white extends. Even if white lives, black's right side is still enormous.]

(;B[nn];W[mm];B[nm];W[ll];B[no];W[mk];B[lj]C[bridges: now white is into black's right side, destroying the territory he had hoped to make.]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[nj];B[ih];W[ni]C[bridges: This connection doesn't seeem very  large. Both groups are stable. Better to push into black's territory.]

C[bridges: why not connect here? Black isn't going to die, and once you've connected, black needs to be a little careful here.]

(;W[se];B[jk]
(;W[jh]C[bridges: worth precisely 0 points. Connect the ko at C14 and white wins.]
;B[cf]C[bridges: Both sides only have a few ko threats (Black at B6, T18, and M7,  White at B11, P1, and at least one followup), so why not try and fight this ko? The game depends on it.]
