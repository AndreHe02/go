I'll precede my comments with >


Hi, I'm Stefan and played White against  a two stone handicap and lost by 15,5 points at the end. Apart from a badly handled invasion on the bottom, maybe you could show me where I could have fared better. Especially I didn't handle the yose well, I think.]

;B[kc];W[kd]C[Stefan: Up to here nothing spectacular. I tried to go for a big moyo in the center.

>You generally don't really want center moyo, there are no points in the center. You could say center influence though. This helps with fighting. Or your moyo along the sides could enlarge into the center. But going for center moyo is not usually good.]

>There wasn't any real yose to discuss, both players made some mistakes that need attention and I pointed them out throughout the game.

Watch out for extending too far from your position.
Try to keep you opponent's stones separated, especially if the game depends on it.
Try to keep your stones all connected, it will help a great deal.

(As you can see, if you had kept the marked black stones separated from the rest you might have been able to kill that group by playing at A, although probably it would have found a way to live.)

Good luck and happy playing
