C[This is a game I played recently against a 2 dan.
Please point out my mistakes. I'm especially interested in the correct direction of play.
Thank you very much for your effort!


>Hi! Thanks for submitting the game! It was an interesting one, even though you won quite easily. It's probably better if you submit games that you lost, but that doesn't really matter. It does mean, though, that my comments are quite negative - it's hard to praise the "correct move" when you are so far ahead that almost any move will win the game! You played a good solid game, no big mistakes at all.

Since white was obviously having a bad day, some of my comments are about his moves as well. I hope that's ok.

The general problem for both was a lack of sharpness. Some of the shapes are inefficient or slack (and at one point w misses a large kill!) but ultimately w loses because he has no plan. Black, for his part, misses lots of chances to play forcefully, gaining a big lead in the opening and managing to hold on to it. The middle game was spectacularly boring considering how active the board was, and w's impressive comeback in the small endgame was not enough to make up for 100 moves of doing nothing!

I've put in a lot of variations, but they're certainly not guaranteed to be correct or even sensible. You can probably beat a lot of them with careful reading! If you have any questions or comments at all, feel free to email me or find me on KGS (I'm "sixsix")

(;W[qk];B[qo]C[>Horrible for w! B is ahead already. With the corner strengthened and the right side so thin, the bottom side becomes very difficult to invade]

>Yes, you need a plan for the corner.];W[ne];B[pf]

(;B[ph]C[>This sequence is pretty bad, see variation.];W[pi]

(;B[qg];W[oh];B[pg]C[>Sealing b in completely is a big bonus. Now w has to work out a plan. Some thoughts for him:

- N16 is annoying, and the usual counter of "living in the corner" might be more difficult after R13.

- The ways for w to use his thickness are to invade the bottom or make a moyo on the left.

-W has to play an active game, since he is short of points and b has no weak groups. W's advantage is his superior influence. His shape is precarious but nothing seems too bad, so he probably has to risk not adding a move.

See variation for how I would play as w]

If B, i dont know :)

> The wedge was obviously bad when w is weak, it helps him make sabaki.

A seems too slack when b is so thick here, but it might have to be played anyway. P3 is a clever move
B doesn't cut, so is useless.

You're right, C is the right move for w. I can't see a particularly good reply for b here. M4 was always a good invasion (after F5) and b played a couple of odd moves, so w gets a decent result.]

C[>W should get B8. It's just endgame from here. W gets a lot of points back, but up to here his only points are the lower left, while his "thickness" is half dead, half dame. B is winning by virtue of the points he got in the first fifty moves. A well-deserved win, but it could have been more convincing and w could have fought harder.
