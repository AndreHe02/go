C[Hello, Reveiwer.. I just played this game online.. I think I did pretty well, though I did lose. I don't really know what to ask for except basically suggestions along the way of what I could've done better. Thanks.]
;B[oo]LB[qc:A][pd:B][qd:C][pe:E][qe:D]C[Your move isn't a very usual opening move. I've marked the usual ones in the upper right.

The problem with your move is that it is too far from from the corner. It gives white the opportunity to get too big a corner.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[oc];B[pd]LB[qc:A][qd:B][pe:C]C[A, B or C are usual moves.

The problem with your move is that it gives white the opportunity to get ahead in the following fight...]
;W[od]C[The white group has five liberties, yours only three.]
;B[oe]LB[pe:A]C[This leaves a nasty cut at A.]
(;W[pp]C[This is a better diagonal move, because white has the protection of the corner in it's back and will get a big territory.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pl];W[pn];B[on];W[ne];B[of];W[nf];B[fc]LB[cf:A]
[dp:B]C[I rather would like to approach the corner from A. It works better with B. Besides that, your stone is too close to the white wall on the right.]
;W[hc];B[dc]LB[fe:A]C[By jumping into the corner the threath is that you will get a small life, while white gets a big influence.

It seems to be better to jump out with A.];W[cc];B[db];W[ee]

(;B[gd]LB[ed:A]C[A is an important point. With your move you are strenghtening white at a point where het gets a lot of points.]
;W[hd]C[This is a move white wanted to play anyway, because it gives a big territory to the right.]
;B[ge];W[fg];B[he]C[Your stones makes no territory, while white gets the promise of a lot of points.]
;W[ie];B[hb];W[ib];B[fe]LB[gb:B][hb:A][ed:C][hg:D]TR[gd][ge]
C[This is a bad move.

Firstly A asks for a continuation at B. Otherwise you shouldn't have played A at all.

Secondly, your move makes a so called 'empty triangle with the marked stones. It gives an inefficient form, because the stone occopies a liberty of the other stones.

B is the move, but if you would play in the neighbourhood, C and D would be a lot better.]
;W[hg]C[Now white encircles you. With the eight stones you've played you will only make a few points, while white has good prospects at the top and the left.]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ha];W[ia];B[gb];W[eb];B[ea];W[cb];B[ca];W[ba]
;B[da];W[fa];B[ec];W[ic];B[bb];W[bc];B[aa];W[dk];B[fl]LB[dn:A]
[fn:B][eo:C]C[This move is too high. It gives white to slide to A, and get a strong left side. Even when you close the door wiht B, white can walk in at C.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[el]LB[fj:A]C[Too agressive, and thereby giving you a chance. I think A is better.]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ek];W[ab];B[gh]LB[dj:A][fk:B]C[If you really like to play the ko, why don't you make it more valuable by playing a A.

Otherwise, if you don't want to play the ko, filling it at B is better.]
;W[gg];B[kg]LB[nh:B][ii:A]C[This move doesn't do very much, because white can walki in at A or B.]
;W[ei];B[fh]LB[em:A]C[This is a small move. What about A?];W[eh]
;B[ba]C[A small move again.];W[em]C[This is a huge blow for black. Whtie is threathening to make a huge territory at the left, while destroying blacks possibilities in the center.]
;B[fo];W[fm];B[gm];W[fk];B[gl];W[ek];B[hh]LB[cn:A]C[A move at A would be big, because white and black can make a lot of territory around there.]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[fi];B[if];W[hf];B[je];W[id];B[ig];W[kc];B[jd]
LB[pc:A][rl:B][cn:C]C[Small. I've marked some big moves.];W[jc]
;B[md];W[nd];B[ld]LB[ng:A]C[This move only give you problems, losing you more point than you should. I would like A. When white plays there, there is not much fun for you at either the right or the center.]

C[Finally, but a bit loose.];W[bl];B[cl]LB[cm:A]C[A move at A would be more secure.]
;W[ck];B[al];W[bk];B[ak];W[aj];B[am];W[bj];B[dm]LB[cm:A]C[Simply A is better.]

C[this doesn't do a lot. You should worry about the connection of your stones in the center and the eye shape. I've marked some better moves.]
;W[gr];B[gp];W[go];B[gn];W[ho]TR[gp]C[The marked stone has only strengthened white.]
;B[kn]C[This is a lot better idea, because it tries to connect your stones.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[nm];B[pm]LB[nl:B][nm:A]C[Good, cutting of the white stones is your only chance. But you can see that your group is weak, because you didn't play this move earlier, so that white has gotten the chance to play A and B.]
