C[
Thank you for the chance to review this game.  In general the game was quite interesting, with a nice flow of moves.

Suggested move changes ( shift click on the position )

25 : Q2 : White can make a larger move
39 : H2 : White can cut at G2
45 : E3 : White can build up with a larger move
47 : C2 : White can make a larger move
57 : D15 : White can threaten to connect, while attacking
71 : E9 : White has strength to support a more aggresive move.
87 : K11 : White can sacrifice a stone to build up an attack
121 : D6 : White can focus on keeping edge territory.

Suggested strategy changes:

Try making more sacrifices, where a move threatens to rescue a stone, and as Black cuts off the stone White gets something even better.  Try playing a few games where you let five stones go as a sacrifice.

Try making more eye space, so that groups are stronger, and attacks are less life or death.  Sometimes eye space is made more easily by sacrificing some of the stones.

Try finding end game moves that demand a response and also earn you more points.

I suspect that end game moves are more cautious to compensate for eye space that is closed by the opponent.]

;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[nq];W[pm];B[pq];W[np]C[Not sure whether this is the best way to play against a contact play at Q3. Normally people play at Q2. I felt that I should play it safe and keep my opponent on the third line.

I like the move, it works well with the Q10 stones, and avoids damage to Q7 area.
Maybe Q2 is ok if white were at R7 rather than Q7.  Sorry, too advanced for me.]

A: Game move : secure the corner, taking points and safety

;W[hq];B[hr]LB[fp:A][gr:B]C[
A: Game move, extends the C6 side up to H6, providing a strong base to attack from,
this works well with the C11 and C14 stones.
however, this feels like really advanced play,
for those who prefer the "moyo" style, with a huge field to fight in.
I would suggest the game be played more simple.

B: Suggestion, cut F3 off from J3
seems like Black may get an outer shell that connects F3 with K4 and N4,
but I think F3 will be cut from K4.]

C[
A: Game move, too safe
B: Grow O4, but may damage H6
C: Grow R14 and Q10
D: build up from C14 and H6]
(;W[fn];B[cr]LB[of:C][fg:B][br:A]C[
A: Game move, White defends the corner, but black is very alive, so is White,
this does get 5 or 6 points, but it feels like an end game mvoe.
White already invested F6 to get D4 very strong, B2 feels like too much investment in D4

B: Suggestion, go for some big space, use C14 and your investment at F6

C: Suggestion, go for some space.];W[br];B[jj]C[This move I felt was too big and I wanted to attack black for making it.

Sounds like White wants to punish Black for his greed.
He who attacks first loses. :)];W[hj];B[fj];W[fg];B[gi];W[hi]
;B[gh];W[ee]C[
I think the goal of E15 is to lean into D16, in preparation to extend from F13 to attack G12

For me, an attack is giving up something good to get something better.
Probably white was thinking black would E16.
But black has so many stones around the corner, he can ignore.

Now that we look at what the threat is, what is white's follow up move?
Black has C17 and H17, supporting D16 and F16,
This makes whites chances of walking into E17 weak.

I think black should have ignored the E15 threat, and connected G12 with L16]
;B[de]LB[ed:A][df:B]C[
A: Game move, threatens to invade E17
pushing at E16 forces black to get strong, and collapses possibilities for white

B: Suggestion, threaten to connect with E15 and F13
Sacrifice E15 to get a strong connection with F13 and attack G12]

(;W[ed];B[ec];W[df];B[fe];W[ef];B[gg]C[
Black threatened the capture of E15 to connect G12 with F16

For me, this is a loss of 20 points for White, 
Black has a very strong connection of G11 with the very alive base at F16
Black can now work with O15 and build up the top.

White has many areas to defend:
- stones at H10, 
- an opening at C9 and 
- a large area around O13, just above a weak area at R12];W[ff]
;B[gf];W[jh];B[ck];W[dj]LB[dk:A][el:B]C[Was there a better way to deal with C9? My opponent connected easily and suddenly I was vulnerable in two areas.

I think your idea is correct, the Black invasion at C9 should fail.
Black should sacrifice the C9 stone to reduce the E7 area.]

(;B[dk];W[ej];B[ek]LB[fk:B][gk:A]C[A: Game move, connecting H10 with G9
B: Suggestion, kill D9

there is a great deal of strength with D4.
you invested the move at B2 and F6 to make it very alive
now is the time to cash in on that strength, and win the fight for D9.

If black threatens to capture K12, you can build up from Q10 and R14.]

A: Game move : capture D6, make sure F5 does not cut the H6 group off,

B: Suggested move : focus on keeping the edge

it may take a bit of reading, but C7 is OK
D6 is an invitation for White to capture D6, so that Black can get more space at B6]

Also, I felt that there were only a few stones difference between our territories, maybe that I might be about 5 stones up given the 4,5 komi.

nice move, keeping three points.
I think you have strong estimation skills.  With a few good sente moves it looks like your can win.]
;B[qh]LB[qi:A][rj:B]C[This invasion strengthened my belief that I might be ahead, also in my opponents mind. I saw this as desperation on black's part and did not believe that he'll be able to make life in my enclosed territory.

A: Game move : prevent Black from forming life.
B: Suggestion : attack from a distance, you have all the strength.

When contact play is done, it is defensive, 
where one is in trouble and hopes to sacrifice a stone or two and make life.
This also helps to settle things, and remove any possible tricky stuff.
Contact play helps to settle things, where each side sacrifices a stone or two and gets life
When distance play is done it is to fight, 
the one with more strength in the area wants to fight.
Distance play keeps the possible moves at the largest.

Here white is very strong, with R14 near by, and no cuts for black to play with.
N11 and R4 may have something, but I don't see what black can do.]
