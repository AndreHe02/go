C[dada: I'm only a kyu player, so don't believe everything I say :o)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ed];B[pj];W[kd]C[dada: unusual :o)];B[jp]
;W[ej]LB[dj:A][cj:B]C[dada: this one is bad. Playing on the 5th line doesn't achieve much.
If you want to have influence then play on the 4th line at A (d10).
If you want to secure a base quickly, then play at the 3rd line at B (c10)

One could also consider playing in the lower right corner, which is very large!]
;B[qo]C[dada: Black has a powerful moyo now]
(;W[pg]LB[cd:A][nc:B][oo:C]C[dada: I can understand that you want to reduce B's moyo, but I don't think that this is the right spot.
You should consider playing at A (c16) and secure your corner. See variation.
Another option is to play B (o17), which expands your own moyo.
You then can still aim at the crucial point of B's moyo C (p5)]
;B[qg]C[dada: This doesn't achive much. Actually it helps W.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[ph];B[qi];W[pi]LB[pf:A][pe:B]TR[pg]C[dada: I don't like this move. First of all it isn't good shape and the cut at A (q14) is serious.
Maybe B (q15) is better, but I don't know. The initial move (marked) was dubious after all, so it's hard to come up with a good followup.]
;B[nd];W[mc]C[dada: the cut has to be protected!
Next this move is almost always bad. A high dan player once said to me: never play diagonal under a stone unless you know exactly what you're doing. In most cases it just helps the opponent to strengthen his stones.]
;B[rf]C[dada: B makes it to easy for W.];W[qe];B[qd];W[oc]LB[re:A]
TR[pi][ph][pg]C[dada: Why? What does this move achieve?
B has made it very easy for you. I'd play at A (s15) without hesitation. The result will favour white.
Maybe you'll lose the three marked stones, but in that case you get the corner.]
;B[re]C[dada: now your chance is gone. And the W stones look very heavy.]
;W[od];B[pf];W[of];B[pe];W[oe];B[pc]C[dada: small];W[me]C[dada: small and not urgent. The upper left corner is the biggest place now.]
;B[cf]LB[cc:A][cd:B][ce:C]C[dada: oops? Usually B plays at A (c17), B (c16) or in special cases at C (c15)]
;W[cd]C[dada: W is happy];B[ci]TR[ej]C[dada: again ones sees clearly, that the marked stone is at the wrong place. Imagine it being at the 3rd line. Makes a great difference.]
;W[di];B[cj]
(;W[cl]LB[dg:A]C[dada: your previous move looked good - you wanted to make use of your influence on the right. But you have to follow it up in a consistent way: building your influence even more. I'd play at A (d13).  See variation.

If you wanted to protect the lower left side, then you shouldn't have played W34 in the first place, because this only provokes B35, which makes B much, much stronger. In that case you should have played at B35 yourself.]
;B[ck];W[cg]LB[dl:A]C[dada: again inconsistent - to protect th elower side you have to play at A (d8)]
;B[bg]C[dada: B is too kind];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm]
;W[bn]LB[cn:A]C[dada: looks like an overplay. The cut at A (c6) is serious.]
;B[an]C[dada: ???];W[ao]LB[am:A][bo:B]C[dada: ??? You must be kidding.
You can't expect to answer at A (a7). You have to extend to B (b5)]
;B[bo];W[am]C[dada: the ko is no good - B will win it - there's no ko threat big enough.]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[an];W[co];B[bn];W[bp];B[ap];W[bq]C[dada: W didn't take advantage of B's mistakes. W has a difficult position now.
B has territory in several places, but W relies onn his moyo at the top. If B can succesfully reduce it, then W has no chance of winning this game.]
;B[dk]C[dada:]
(;W[el]LB[oj:A]C[dada: Both B59 and this W60 are dubious. The big urgent point is A (p10).
Why? Because it's on an intersection of two competing moyos. Whoever plays there
first enlarges his own moyo and reduces the opponents moyo. Have a look at the variations - maybe the pictures say more than thousand words.

A (p10) remains the biggest and most urgent point on board until played.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[dada: good! You are strong in this area, so fight. B61 is an overplay.]
;B[hp];W[jq];B[iq];W[ir];B[ip];W[kq]C[dada: looks ok];B[hr]
;W[gq]TR[ir]C[dada: ??? B can capture the marked stone now]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[gp];W[gr]TR[jr]C[dada: ??? Capturing the marked B stones is the only way to play here.]
;B[is]C[dada: W is destroyed.];W[js];B[ks];W[fp];B[ep];W[fo]
;B[fr];W[eq]C[dada: small! Don't go after peanuts. There are big bucks at stake somewhere else.
I know it's hard to keep cool after engaging in a fight. Put the mouse away - take two or three deep breaths and look carefully at the board again. The moyo is all you have. Expand it!]
;B[lp];W[kn]LB[oj:A]C[dada: The general idea is good. But A (p10) is the right place.]
;B[kp]C[dada: B is too kind.];W[ls];B[js]C[dada: B is too kind. B should have ignored W's previous move.]
;W[er];B[gs];W[nr]C[dada: No way! You can't live here until B makes a series of silly mistakes.]
;B[lr];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[nq];W[mq];B[lq];W[lo];B[np];W[no]
;B[mr];W[mo]C[dada: Wow - you're really lucky that B settled for the small edge.]
;B[oo];W[on];B[po];W[pn]LB[oj:A]C[dada: No, no, no! This might have been your last chance to play at A (p10)]
;B[oi]C[dada: finally];W[oh];B[nj];W[ni];B[oj];W[ng]LB[nh:A]
TR[ni]C[dada: should be at A (o12) - that way B can't set the marked stone on atari]
;B[qn];W[qm]LB[pm:A][mj:B][nh:C]TR[ng]C[dada: this is an overplay. B can cut at A (q7) - again: try to protect your moyo and play at B (n10).
Notice that it would be much more convinient if the marked stone was at C (o12) - but B is still possible.]
;B[rm];W[rl]C[dada: you like to leave cuts behind, don't you?]
;B[ql]C[dada: of course];W[pm];B[rk];W[pl];B[qk];W[mi]C[dada: you are lucky. B made it possible that you play this move - you should be grateful.]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[ek];W[fk];B[en];W[em];B[fn];W[eo];B[go];W[gn]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[lk];W[lh]LB[kj:A][li:B]C[dada: Why not play at A (l10) instead? You don't have to worry about anything. And if you are very, very frightend, then play at B(m11), which prevents the atari.]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[ji];B[lj];W[mh]C[dada: unnecessary - you lose a move here.
And your group below is really in big trouble now.];B[jn];W[jm]
;B[ko];W[lm];B[hn];W[hm];B[im];W[il];B[in];W[jl]C[dada: again B was too kind]
;B[jj];W[ij];B[gc]C[dada: B's last challenge - a little bit late really. B shouldn't be able to live here.]
;W[gd]LB[fc:A]C[dada: you should try to kill black. Minimize his eyespace. Don't mind if he runs into the center - B has nowhere to run to. I'd play at A (f17) without thinking twice.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[ic];W[id]C[dada: you make it too easy for B - but it may already be too late.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[fc];W[hc];B[hb];W[hd];B[db];W[cb];B[eb];W[fd]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[ka];W[la];B[jb];W[jd]C[dada: I think you lost the game here - I know it's hard to decide wether to contain (i.e. seal in) the invading stone or try to kill it. The only way to know is to count. Counting may seem awkward, but without it you're unable to choose the right way. Sealing the opponent in is a very attractive choice during the middle game, as you gain considerable outside influence. On the other hand trying to kill is very dangerous - if you fail (and in most cases you will) your position is worse than if you sealed the opponent in.

But here I'd go for the kill for two reasons: sealing in leaves you too less territory - so you can't win that way.
Secondly B has no way to run to - there are W stones in every direction. Try to kill him - if you fail you lose the game (you lose it for sure if you seal him in) - if you succeed you win. And here you should have a good chance killing him.]

C[dada: unnecessary];B[ob];W[nc]LB[nb:A]C[dada: should be at A (o18)]
;B[ak];W[qb];B[pb];W[rc]C[dada: desperate - there's no way you can live here]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[na];W[sd];B[rd];W[sc];B[qa];W[ra];B[qc];W[pa]
;B[oa]LB[sb:A]C[dada: BIG mistake - if B plays at A (t18) W is dead.]
;W[sb]C[dada: that you get a ko out of this is more than you deserve]
;B[qa];W[rn];B[sl];W[pa];B[fl];W[gl];B[qa];W[gb];B[ga];W[pa]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[qa];W[fa];B[fb];W[pa];B[mn];W[ln];B[qa];W[bh]

;B[qa];W[ha];B[ja];W[pa];B[ml];W[mm];B[qa];W[ha];B[ea];W[pa]
;B[es];W[ds]C[dada: you should've ended the ko here - the upper corner is much bigger.]
;B[qa];W[ai];B[bi];W[pa];B[fs];W[qa]C[dada: gee - W is really lucky.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[cs];W[dq];B[ds];W[bs];B[aq];W[ar];B[ao];W[dj]
;B[se];W[jk];B[kl];W[km];B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[rp];B[ro];W[qq]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr];W[sp]C[dada: you are already dead now - the former B move killed you no matter what you play]
;B[sn]C[dada: B should play somewhere else];W[ps];B[os];W[qs]
;B[ll];W[so];B[kk];W[pk];B[ma];W[rj];B[qj]C[dada: Actually W should've won this game easily. B backed away and played a lot of weak and small moves.
Unfortunatly W made at least three big mistakes: one on the lower side, where he got annihilated, one on the right, by not playing the urgent point to enlarge his moyo and one on the upper side, where he didn't try to kill black, which was his last chance to win the game.
It looks like some of the mistakes were made because of making ones move too fast. So take your time!

(;W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol];B[om];W[nm];B[on];W[nn]C[dada: ok, ok - the last two moves by W are a little bit dangerous, but just to give you the general idea.]
)
(;B[oj];W[ni];B[nj];W[mi];B[lk]C[dada: compare this with the previous variation: the difference is too big to be counted.]
))
(;W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[ch];W[eg]LB[oj:A]C[dada: B lives on the edge, but W has built up impressive thickness.
Next A (p10) is an urgent and big point for both sides.]))
(;W[cd]TR[ej]C[Dada: Both moyos look equal in size, so you're doing well from this point of view.
But now it becomes clear that the marked stone is on the wrong place.]
