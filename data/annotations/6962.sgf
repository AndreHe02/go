C[tchrikch [8k\]: hi gg
jesssster [9k\]: hello, good game!


-----
So thanks for reviewing this game.
It was played against a slightly stronger player (8k as opposed to my 9k - who insisted on having 6,5 points komi as well). But I took my time and thought things were going well. Looking at the game afterwards I couldn't find so many big mistakes either, so I'm not sure exactly what went wrong. Happy for any suggestions you can make...

Thanks again for your help!
Jesse

(;B[jn];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj];B[jl];W[jk];B[km]LB[eg:C][lh:B][qk:A]
C[EmTom: This move doesnt do that much... Did you ask yourself what is its purpose? Did you count teritory? Did you think about what you need to do to win this game? These are important questions. Especially the last one. If you know how much ahead you are, you can decide how many points you can give to your opponent. 

If you thought about this at this moment in the game you would probably notice that:
- you are ahead. My estimation is about 65 pts for black, about 30 for white without the center. That means you can allow white to get 30(!!!) points in the center. Is it even possible to get 30 points there? It seems this should have been a comfortable win for you. 
- If you know that you are ahead by about 30 pts, you know that all you need to do is to calmly play endgame. So maybe you start with A, maybe B, C... anything. 

Anyway your move is not worth that much so you begin to lose the game right here.]
;W[lk];B[ei]C[EmTom: You push white forcing him to close his moyo... What for?]

(;B[kj]C[mistake, I started to feel that I had to get away with something I shouldn't be able to get away with. Of course that doesn't work often when white is stronger...

EmTom: Just count points. If you are behind you do have to come up with something more than you can. When you are ahead however you should play calm reducing moves. Just simple yose moves. It is your opponent who needs to complicate game.]

(;B[mj]C[EmTom: It seems you started to panic... Changing plans every other move... If you started the invasion you HAVE TO do something with it. You allowed white 30 points there so game becomes very close.]

EmTom: Well... you actually played a good game... You were ahead by a lot but you forgot to count points so you didnt know about it. Then you were affraid that center is too big for white so you started to play kamikaze moves instead of just reducing it calmly. You also missed the oportunity on thr right side. Mistakes in yose roughly cancelled themselves. Its a shame to lose a game like this. A good lesson anyway :)

I hope you like the review. It was a difficult game to comment due to all those fights at the beginning. If you have some more questions (maybe I have overlooked something) feel free to ask on KGS. 

Good luck in your future games!
