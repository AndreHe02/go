AB[pd][dp][pp]C[KiraBox [11k\]: hello
jimabcd [8k\]: hi

[KB\]: In this game I play black.

[DAB\]: Hi, I'm Dave, I'll be reviewing this game.];W[dd]C[jimabcd [8k\]: gg]
;B[cg];W[fc];B[cm]C[[KB\]: This seems like a fairly strong move to me, but I'd normally think of D10. I was experimenting.

[DAB\]:  I was debating about saying something to help C13.  White defended the corner with F17, and now C13 is left with 2 comfortable running directions (to the centre, and along the side to the bottom).  But C7 is also a strong move and indirectly helps C13.  I think it is a move that works, since white would have a harder time if he chose to split C7 from C13.  Still it is complicated for the following reasons:

1. C7 doesn't make a strong defense of the corner like C6 would, so there is a trade off to play a long shimari like this.

2.  Both C13 and C7 are "low" - they are on the third line.  It will take another move to have these stones work together.]
;W[nd]LB[nc:A][pf:B]C[[DAB\]:  A high approach to a 4x4 should normally be avoided.  I think black can make a tidy profit here (A), or could also play in a more flexible way (B).  Either choice, I think black will take a local advantage.]

(;B[oe]C[[DAB\]:   I don't understand this move.  Normally, something like P15 is played to ensure that your 4x4 stone retains access to the centre, but there is no danger of losing that here.]
;W[ne];B[hd]LB[jc:B][jd:A]C[[KB\]: Strengthening the top-right first seems more urgent in retrospect, then invade.

[DAB\]:  Agreed.  Why is black invading now?  Black isn't behind in territory.  Also, this particular invasion helps white - A or B settle white's top group while pinching black's H16 stone.  you have given white a "free" move that serves two purposes.  See the previous comments as well - the combination of F17 (low) and O16 (high) is awkward for white to build any moyo here, so there are two reasons that invading is not urgent: 1. black is not behind in territory, 2. White will have a hard time making an efficient moyo on the top side.]
;W[jd];B[hf];W[eg]LB[di:A]C[[DAB\]:  White is aggressive.  E13 makes sense, but is bad shape.  Since is pressures C13 and threatens the H14 group.  still, the long knight's jump between D16 and E13 could  be a problem for white.]

(;B[gh];W[ei]TR[dh][ci][cj]C[[DAB\]: You must help C13, this looks like a severe attack on it.  You don't want it to be surrounded without any hope of a future (a connection to the outside).  It could even die, allowing white to capture on a grand scale.]

(;B[og]C[[DAB\]:  This move makes little sense to me.  It is 5 lines from the edge - so has very little control over the side.  It is putting some pressure on white, but if white plays to defend his group on the top, it will make black's H16 group weaker.]

(;W[cj]C[[DAB\]:  White has made a good move here.  Now black has to live inside and will likely not have any future (i.e. no connection to the outside).]

(;B[gj];W[el]LB[bd:B][em:A]C[[DAB\]: In the game, black chose A.  This attachment will force both sides to build strength.  What other choices are available for black?

B:  Making a living shape is very urgent I think.  The biggest move on the board.]

(;B[em]C[[DAB\]: what is this move serving?  Remember that attaching to stones will inevitably make both sides stronger locally.]
;W[fl]C[[DAB\]: White just extends and now, locally, is stronger.  What has black gained in exchange?  Not very much I think.]
;B[dl];W[dk]TR[dl][cm][em]C[[DAB\]:  Locally, white has built some influence - thanks to black.  Black has built a wall (marked) that faces his 4x4 stone in the corner.  A small moyo, but not worth building up white.  Prior to this, white was not much stronger than black's line of stones starting at H16.  Now, white has some thickness to attack black's line.]

(;B[gl];W[fm]C[[DAB\]: an easy split for white. Black will need to help E7 while G8 looks like a tomato thrown at a tank.  white F8 is thick while G8 is thin. Try to avoid attaching like this, when it isn't necessary. See possible variations.]
;B[en];W[fn];B[fk];W[ek];B[ji]C[[DAB\]:  I like this - give the group some shape.]
;W[cl]C[[DAB\]: A tenuki here may be reasonable, but J5 (your move in the game) has little meaning.  Being 5 lines high, it has little (if any) control over the side and is not good shape in relation to the corner or the centre group.  

For me, I think I would simply connect.  I don't like the possible developments that arise here.]

(;B[io];W[eo];B[do];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm]LB[bd:C][pj:B][ep:A]C[[KB\]: Oops. I like to leave stuff like this a lot. It happens in all of my games, but I feel it's because I play too aggressive and always feel like I'm behind on points.

[DAB\]:  Yeah, I think it was inefficient to build this wall so close to your 4x4 stone to begin with (the E7 attachment at move 18).  Still, locally, it isn't a total failure - you have a sizeable corner.  But white does have some powerful thickness in the centre and aiming right into the side you had looked like you were trying to develop with J5.  

[DAB\]: C is still the biggest move I think.  If white plays in that area, C13 is virtually dead, and white has a strong hold on the corner.  A huge profit.]

(;B[bo]C[[DAB\]: Forget about this.  This is a small point area to fuss over - the board is still wide open.  See variations.]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[gq]
(;B[iq];W[kq]C[[DAB\]: If I was white, I would use my thickness differently here - I would play O3.  (but actually, I think I would play B16 and finish the top left first).]

(;B[kp]C[[KB\]: I think I like J7 better. White might follow with O3 and then I can press them down.

[DAB\]: Don't attach to weak stones.];W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[[DAB\]: What is your plan here?  Why do you cut?  Locally, black is much weaker and will probably come out behind in this struggle.]

(;B[rq];W[rr]
(;B[pr]C[[DAB\]: this can't kill white. So all black accomplishes is removing any aji for later.]
;W[qr];B[nr];W[ps];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[qn]C[[DAB\]:  This is very similar to a variation where black is left with some options in the corner.  Here, there is nothing (well, very little) left to threaten white with.]
;W[ql]C[[DAB\]:  Oh wow!  It is a gift for black here!  play to press white's single low stone against your wall!]
;B[qj]C[[DAB\]:  Make as severe a pinch as possible, you can only gain by pushing white against your thickness.]

(;W[qh]
(;B[oi]C[[KB\]: Q12 seems stronger. I feared his stronger reading would make eyes in the center and leave me with no points.

[DAB\]: This is exactly how I would play.  Q12 is not stronger - it would help white's single stone gain power.]
