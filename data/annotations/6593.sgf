C[Dear reviewer

I played white against the high chinese opening. I lost because I made a heavy group in the lower right and missed a tesuji in the centre.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

Reviewer: Hi! guigsy,  if you had a sharp  sensitivity for  own week stones, you wolud become to a much stronger player.]

(;B[fq]C[guigsy: Normally black plays K4.
R:Also I think K4 is better than F3.
Your selected position (K4) is key stones for both side.];W[jp]

C[This is OK for me, because black's chinese formation is a bit flat.]
;B[lq]C[guigsy: I am not sure how to play here. K3 or G3 feels much too submissive.]
;W[po];B[qq]
(;W[nq]C[guigsy: This looked like a nice move, because I can play N4 to put pressure on the M3 stone or P4 to put pressure on the corner. I should just play normally, like in the variations.
R:Separation of  black stones  would be best choice.];B[mp]
;W[op];B[ro];W[mn]C[guigsy: This is an overplay. My group in the lower right is not strong enough. I can't see any good moves, though.]

(;W[lg]C[guigsy: I should just play O16. I then have one weak group against black's two.
RI support your consideration.
 This Nozoki is overplay. First, white should live own big stones.]

Now white has two week stones in the center and moreover the big long 15 stones.]
