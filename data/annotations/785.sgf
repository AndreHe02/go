(;W[cd]LB[cc:A][cf:B]C[sita: Not good. If b answers with the natural move at 'a' he has a good
profit in the corner and w cannot make a wide extension along the left edge,
because there remains a weak point at 'b'.
Look at the variation to find a standard sequence.];B[po];W[np]
;B[pl];W[dh]LB[cc:A][cf:B]C[sita: So b did not play 'a', w should play there to erase the weak point at
'b'.];B[cm];W[ck]TR[dp][np]LB[iq:A]C[sita: Wrong direction. b and w both want to develop along the lower edge,
because the marked stones are high. w should play around 'a'.]
;B[gq]C[sita: Too small. This extension should be at least two rows to the right. Do
not fear an invasion. You will be happy to have a target to attack in an area
where you are strong.];W[iq];B[jd];W[qf];B[qe]LB[qh:A]TR[pl]
C[sitaL: I would suggest a pincer at 'a'. It is not only a pincer, but makes
also good shape with the marked stone.];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj];B[qk]
;W[oj]LB[pj:A][rj:B]C[sita: This move must be at 'a', even if it feels a little bit 'spirit-less'
to play the same move two times in a row. Black 'b' is now sente and gives him
an excellent position. It should be played immediately.];B[kq]
TR[iq]C[sita: This is indeed a weak point. Here it shows that the marked stone was
probably a little bit too far to the left.];W[kp];B[mq]LB[jp:A]
[lp:B]C[sita: I would fight harder. Maybe 'a' or 'b'.];W[nq]
;B[jq];W[jp];B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[hq];B[lp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kn]
;B[nn];W[kl];B[gp]TR[gq][hp][hq][iq][ip][io]LB[fq:A]C[marcel: Probably G4 was no good move by black, because J4-group gets very
weak.

sita: The idea to strengthen the single marked black stone is good, because it
strengthens indirectly the two marked black stones (by weakening the white
ones). Probably 'a' is a little bit more solid.];W[ho];B[cq]
TR[io][ip]C[sita: I do not think that this is a good idea. The marked stones are cutting
stones and thus very important. b should try to save them.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[hr];B[eq];W[in];B[pj]LB[rj:A]C[sita: As mentioned before 'a' is the vital point here. The actual move only
strengthens w and does not do much for b's position.];W[pi]
;B[pk];W[qi];B[oi]LB[cc:A][qq:B][re:C][jc:D][mn:E]C[sita: b wants to capture a single meaningless stone? b is leading by quite
some points, so he should start the endgame by playing a move like 'a', 'b',
'c' or 'd'. Probably best is 'e', which connects the two groups in the bottom
right, so that there is nothing left to worry about for him.]
;W[oh]C[sita: good!];B[ni];W[nj]TR[oj]LB[nh:A][mh:B][lc:C]C[sita: But that is bad. The idea for w must be to sacrifice the marked stone
(how many points can b make in this area? seven...?) and build a wall by
pushing two times more at 'a' and 'b'. After that he is ready to invade
somewhere around 'c'.];B[mi];W[mj]
(;B[mg]C[sita: I would instead suggest the sequence in the variation.]
;W[li];B[lh]LB[ng:A];W[ki];B[kh];W[mn]C[marcel: Obviously B should have invested one more stone in the past...

sita: Nothing to add. :)];B[mo]C[sita: These stones seem to be dead now. It would be better not to play there.
But I admit that it is not obvious to see in this position.]
;W[no];B[nr];W[or];B[mr];W[ln];B[jr];W[mp];B[ls];W[lq];B[lr]
;W[ns];B[ff]C[sita: Good! That is the borderline between two moyos.]
;W[fc];B[ed];W[hc];B[hd]LB[ic:A][jc:B]TR[ff]C[sita: I would suggest to play a move like 'a' or perhaps 'b' here. This would
prevent the w stones from getting eyes and b can chase them all over the board.
Furthermore it would put the just played marked stone in proper use.]

;W[ic];B[id];W[eb];B[jb];W[ib];B[kb]C[marcel: Was the moyo at move 75 too loose so that an invasion here was
unavoidable,
or did B just defend too bad?

sita: Neither the one nor the other. Read my comment to move #78.]

;W[sm]C[T7 was a fault by W, so life was easy for B...

sita: But there is no way for w to kill the b group. This was the best w could
do now I think.];B[rm];W[so];B[qm];W[sp];B[sn]

;B[fg];W[ef];B[hj]LB[qc:A][bl:B]C[sita: All the last moves are pretty small, considering that an invasion at
'a' should be at least a ko for w or that there are double-sente moves (moves,
which are sente for both) like 'b'.];W[hk];B[ci]C[sita: Oops. Interesting invasion.]

;W[ag];B[ae];W[pg];B[ng];W[sk];B[aa]C[marcel: Is the ko at B19 better than A19?

sita: Indeed. 'a' is no longer w's territory. So w loses a point. If w wins the
ko, he gets the point back. b is not dissatisfied, because he had not lost
anything. But if b wins the ko, he gained a point.];W[ba];B[ac]
;W[bo]C[sita: Oops! Is it possible for w to get one eye here? :)]
;B[cn];W[bq];B[bp]LB[br:A]C[sita: 'a' is a little bit more safe.]
;W[ap];B[cp];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[br];W[aq];B[ao]C[marcel: Maybe B should have passed here, but he was too anxious...

sita: It depends. If b does not want to let w get one eye, he cannot pass here.
:) Otherwise passing would be ok.];W[an];B[ar];W[tt];B[tt];C[marcel: Thanks for commenting!
