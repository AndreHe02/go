C[As white in this game I had as usual big problems. Often I did not know exactly what to do.

I eventually lost by time ...
I believe the game was close to about 5 points or so.

I added some notes to the moves which I had the most difficulties with.

Thanks for reviewing the game.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]C[patrickb: Black's formation is the start of the a very common opening from the 19th century. Instead of taking the remaining corner, white will sometimes approach the upper right corner, to keep black from making an enclosure there and making the right side harder to deal with. However, that is by no means absolute, and taking the other corner is fine.]

(;W[dd]C[My opponent seemed to aim at two corner enclosures, so my thoughts were:
If Black P17 then I would play R9, if then Black R5 or R6 I would play R12 stabilizing my gruop (if B R11 I play R6). Would this be ok?

patrickb: Generally, letting your opponent make two corner enclosures isn't ideal, though I can't quite go so far as to say it's bad. That's not to say that D16 is bad. Playing R9, though, doesn't work that well, because after b takes the enclosure at the lower right, he has sente to make a long extension at the bottom. The R6, Q6, or Q5 approaches could be used to break up the left side, and keep b from making two enclosures. They also can't be pincered as severely as an R5 approach could be. I've included a few variations...

Therefore I decided to play D16.

patrickb: Again, nothing wrong with D16]
(;B[cj]C[I was surprised.
Is this equally good as a corner enclosure?

patrickb: Ah, black is one of these players. :) He doesn't want you to build up a large moyo, so he starts breaking it up right away. In general, the corner enclosures are generally prefered. If black is going to play this way, he's probably be better off not playing komoku(3-4) in the other corners. This will probably lead to a fighting game, and the 3-4 points without enclosures don't work as well in fighting, especially compared to your 4-4 stones.]
;W[oc]C[patrickb: Keeping black from getting this enclosure was important. Good.]
;B[jc]C[Another surprise ... looks good to me, since Black can extend either to N17 or G17.

patrickb: Huh. I don't care for it. It seems a litte unfocued. It doesn't put a lot of pressure on w either way. Again, black is trying hard to keep either side from having a large territory but not much more. Note that this is *not* a pincer against the white stone at P17. That stone can still play a two-point extension if needed.

patrickb: Note that again, w's corner points are better situated for center-and-side fighting that b's corner points. The real question, of course, what to do next as w. I'd be tempted to approach the bottom now, perhaps, or double-approach the top at R14.]

(;W[lc]C[I decide to stabilize my own group before engaging in any fight.

Maybe I should have played first P15?

patrickb: Probably not P15. If you're going to play in that area, Q15, pushing down on black is a better option, or double-approaching at R14, perhaps. In general, I think this is fine. It will most likely start a sequence of stabilizing moves around the edges of the board, but those look fine for w, to me.

patrickb: Also, you didn't need a move here to stabilize, because you have the R17 attachment (shown in the variation) if you need it.]
;B[gc];W[cf]C[My idea was to stabilize myself and put the C10 stone a bit under pressure...

patrickb: Yes. You can go as far as C13 here, with the long approach at the top, and have a little more leverage against the C10 stone later. This is a more careful, corner-oriented way of playing but by no means bad.]
;B[db];W[cc]LB[fb:A]C[... stabilizing my group, probably too passive?

patrickb: No, this is fine. By the way, white has a placement at A for later in the game to recapture the corner, unless b spends another move here. The Davies book "Tesuji" covers it thoroughly, but I've included both the most simple and complicated of the variations here for reference.]

(;B[cm];W[gq];B[cq];W[cp]C[The idea was to let Black live below, build a wall and then attack later when the occasion arises the group C7 and C10.]
;B[dq]C[... strange ... I expected the sequence Black B4, White B5, Black B3 and White C5 ...

Is this black move a good move here with White G3 in place?

patrickb: yes, it's relatively standard. I've included one common variation of it.]

(;W[bq]C[I decide to play B3 and see what happens ...];B[br]

(;W[bp]C[I thought very long for this move.
Possible other moves where either B5 or E3.

I discarded B5 quickly since it would allow A3 in sente and then some Black move around E3.

I tought long about E3 and the implications (see variation).

I am still not sure what is better. Could you give me your opinion, please?

patrickb: I really prefer E3 here. If b catches the B3 stone, he weakes the left side even more for paltry profit, and b is more effectively sealed in if you play E3.]
;B[fq];W[fp]
(;B[eq];W[ep];B[ar];W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[cs]C[Black gets 5 points, I have a nice wall which looks down menacingly to C7 and C10, I have a defect at G4, but ... I get out sente!

patrickb: probably best to go ahead and repair G4 by playing H5 or thereabouts. You really get a good thick result out of that. This is not a good result for b, but he could have gotten a better result...]

(;W[qo]LB[gp:A][mp:B]C[Probably wrong direction?

I tought long here if not attacking from O4 or so ... but then the saying says not try to build up territory in front of your strenght but to use it to fight ...

... also Black would get R5 himself, too good to allow!

patrickb: hard to say, but this asks b to play at the bottom which does to some extent neutralize the influence you just built, *and* make the weak point at A somewhat more problematic. If nothing else, the high-approach at Q5 might be better. Still, in a situation like this, I might be tempted to use of off-side approach around B.]
;B[mq]LB[gp:C][np:B][op:A]C[patrickb: This is tighter than B would normally play (A and B are common), but in this case with the white wall to the left, the white weakness at C, and the black stone at the top right corner, this feels correct. B is expecting strong fighting on the right and doesn't want to have to worry about the bottom.]
;W[qf]TR[mq]C[The idea was here to get Black respond locally, then I build up some wall and then play later around Q10 to map out some moyo ...

patrickb: interesting... that may be too much to expect, however, as b gets stronger at the top corner, white will have to reinforce the top somewhat as well, which will make it hard to build up the right side which looks pretty thin right now. Also, remember that b presumably played safely at the bottom with the marked stone for a good reason...]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[me]C[I think I had to play here, even if I wanted to play desperately at P14, but the group P17, M17 started looking very weak there ...

patrickb: I don't think the top is *that* weak yet, but this is a good point to take, if nothing else to keep b cut off from the upper left, and to help you build to the right.]
;B[of];W[og];B[pb];W[pc];B[qc];W[ob];B[qb];W[re]C[Seems now like a huge error ... since it does not really threaten the live of the black group. :(
Should have been better at Q10 or P5?

patrickb: This actually does threaten the b group's eye shape, but b has an easy escape at O13. This feels premature. Instead, think about sealing b in at O13 instead? Then b has to make life in the corner, while you develop on the outside.]
;B[qk]C[Black gets to play the BIG point :(

patrickb: B has no business playing this way with the top right so weak, at least if he wants the top right to live. So, for a lesson in life and death see the variation.]

(;W[oo]C[Here I did not know what to play.
R11 came to my mind, but seemed just to weaken R5.

Pushing at S8 or so would provoke Black R12 (which Black  played anyway)

S3 would have provoked Black P5 sealing me in.

I think I should've played R13 here ... what do you think?

patrickb: definitely *not* R13. It's an empty triangle that doesn't accomplish besides protecting a cut that can't be cut. W has lots of weakness on the board, between the G4 cut, the lone stones in the lower right, and two groups at the upper right. O13 strikes me as the only move, since it connects the two groups at the top and should kill the corner.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[pi];W[oi];B[pj];W[qq]C[I wanted to play O13, but my group in the corner started to look weak, so I played here.

;W[nq];B[nr];W[op]LB[fb:B][ch:A]C[For this move I thought very long.

I wanted to make a wall at M2 and M3 (in sente of course) and I read out that the cut here would be a problem, so this is why I played here.

Comments?

patrickb: making a wall at M2/M3 is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it's the right idea. It doesn't make that much territory (b peeps at H4 and jumps into the middle reduces it a good bit, if he doesn't outright cut at G4) The important things that jump out at me right now:   patrickb: A is sente, threatening to play B9 and leave the b group eyeless. B is getting large enough to play now, too. I'd be tempted to play O13 in sente now (b has to play T18 to live), and then play A, and then B. Note that playing O13 before F18 is useful, because it gives b less weakness to exploit at the top if he finds himself short on eyes.]
;B[pr];W[lq];B[mp];W[lr];B[mr]
(;W[di]C[The idea is now to get through attacking moves some kind of wall facing the center to build up some moyo.

But maybe it would have been better to play M4 or L5 first?

patrickb: This isn't really much of a direct attacking move, though. B plays E10, then C11,  and the left side is secure. THat's not saying this is a bad move. This could be used to build thickness to attack against the b group at the top after you play F18, perhaps... see the variation]

(;B[bh];W[ch];B[bg];W[fc]C[Not a good move I think, since there is no continuation for me in sente ... :(

Maybe I should have played E17 and after Black E18 I play G16?

White about 56 points
Black about 44 + 4 prisoners
