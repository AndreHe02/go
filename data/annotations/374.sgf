layed very well and clearly have a good grasp of the principals of go. Please don't be offended by my comments, as they are very negative at times.  I really enjoyed reviewing this game, and please feel free to send me any games to review.  It helps me ju
st as much as it helps you.  Keep in mind that I make many mistakes too and don't take every comment to seriously.
Feel free to ask for a teaching game if you see me on IGS.
Good luck! :)]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[cincin-gideon(B) IGS]RE[W+24.5]

 cincin 17k : good luck.];B[gc];W[nd];B[pf];W[pc]C[this should be played later.  white is stable on top, because the stone is high and white can run to the center easily. This move loses sente without much compensation.]
;B[qd];W[oc];B[qc];W[kc];B[qk];W[qh]C[This is a good invasion point, and I do like invasions myself, but this is way to early.  Play in open places in the begining, because your stones have more value.  Black will get compensating territory.    Think about what you would do if black played K4.  You might get ten points of territory inside black, but black could grab another big point like C10, and you would be in big trouble.]
;B[qg];W[rh]C[Now your stones are heavy and you must save them.
  A sacrafice of one stone here would have been good, black might play Q12 and his stones would be incredibly overconcentraited.
Better to run out than live small anyway, especially in an invasion, where most of your gain is the stolen points from the opponent.]
;B[rg];W[ph];B[nf]C[I like P9 to ensure big profit on the bottom.];W[qn]
C[This move is risky,  but in a handicap game it could be good.];B[oj]C
[correct.];W[og];B[of];W[pj];B[pk];W[oi];B[ok];W[rk];B[qj]C[No! If S10, you have two weak groups.  Black has what is called a splitting attack.   Every stone he plays attacks two of your groups.  One will surely die.]
;W[rj];B[pn]C[Right idea, but if white grabs K4 first, blacks thickness wont be that effective.]
;W[rp]C[Better at R7 or S6, you give black another great opportuni
ty to chop you apart.];B[qm];W[rn];B[pm]C[Too timid.  Because it is a handicap game, white is weak, and so go for the kill. No matter how good white is, S7 or S8 will chop White into two weak peices and white will be in big trouble.]
;W[pg];B[sg]C[way too small. K4 is big, S7 is huge, and there are many other bigger points on the board.]
;W[sh]C[wasted move, if anything connect at S7 where black really can cut you off.]
;B[qr]C[Too small. Lets look at the bi
gger points. (S7 remains the biggest move on the board until white secures both groups or wither side plays there)
K4 or J4 are the perfect distance from the giant wall black has built.  White doesnt dare play between the stone and the wall, so black can build a massive moyo on the bottom. C16 attacks the white stone on the left while surrounding territory on top.
C10 attacks the stone while surrounding territory on the bottom.];W[jq]
C[Good.
Now blacks wall is much less effective.];B[rm]C[Yes! White should pay for that mistake.]
;W[rr];B[qq]C[White is dead in the bottom right.];W[rq]C[wasted move, save this kind of thing for ko threats.]
;B[lq]C[Too close to your wall anyway, and now white lives.
(R5 forces S5, then S1 kills white - there really is death in the hane)
Even if black doesnt see this, the white group above is very ripe for the attack.]
;W[gq]C[good idea, but white cant afford this.  Play the urgent points (R5, N11) before the big points.]
;B[cm]C[Wrong for the same reason.];W[cj]C[Another good idea, grabbing the big open points, but if black finds the urgent points on the right, white looses.]
;B[cd];W[mi]C[Yes!];B[er]C[Playing on the second line in open areas is not *generally* a good idea.  There are important times to do it, but not here.
E3 protects better against C3, if thata what black is worried about.];W
[fr]C[Too small, I suggest E14 as the biggest move on the board.];B[eq]
;W[fp]C[Odd move, G5 looks better locally, and I still like E14 with the same idea. Remember, white is still weak a C12, and should be carefull.]
;B[ko]C[Yeah, I like this move.  They say don't build territory with thickness, but it's late in the game, and it's a lot of territory, and what else is your thickness going to be doing?]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[jn];B[ef]C[Good];W[dg];B[eg];W[dl]C[odd move, Black will probably not let you connecyt to the bottom, and will make this move silly.]
;B[cl]C[Mistake, Whitr can get a large territory noe st D7 or E7 or E6]
;W[dk]C[Too secure, white is loosing and whould play more risky.];B[en]
C[Good, all of the territories are pretty much settled, black should be able to hang on and win this game by twenty points at least.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[dm]C[Wasted move, J17 is worth a lot of points.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[lp]C[To aggresive, I dont see how this can succede.];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[jp];B[ln]C[good, White has just solidified blacks territory.]
;W[mp]C[futile];B[nr];W[oq];B[nq];W[np];B[op];W[qp];B[po];W[pr]C[doesnt work]
;B[qs];W[rs];B[pq];W[ml];B[mm]C[I like pushing at M8 better, black could loose if white creates a huge center territory.]
;W[nl];B[nm];W[lk];B[kl];W[jl];B[ll];W[kk]C[Bad for black, White's center is getting more and more solid.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[km];W[ik];B[eh]C[Good idea.];W[dh];B[if]C[Great, black cuts into white and snatches some territory in the process.]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[hg];B[kf]C[Black should just connect solid.  White H15 Erases a huge chunk of black's territory.]
;W[hf];B[ge];W[he];B[ld];W[lc];B[md];W[mc];B[ne];W[bk];B[bl];W[kd];B[ke]

(;B[cc]C[Too passive.  No matter how good white is, he is killed without a doubt in 3 moves.  Your lead is slipping away
 with these cautious moves.];W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[df];W[bg];B[bb];W[ab];B
[cb];W[gb]C[doesnt work];B[hd];W[id];B[fg];W[fc];B[fd]C[oops, blacks fearfull responc
es gets him in trouble];W[ia];B[fb];W[hb];B[ga];W[jc];B[hc]C[count your liberties! :)]
;W[gd];B[ec];W[gc];B[ea];W[ha];B[pb]C[Yes, biggest move on board.];W[ob]
;B[qb];W[nj];B[gm]C[
shouldnt work];W[hl];B[gn];W[fo];B[gp]C[loses a point for nothing, try F3]
;W[fq];B[js]C[In situations like this, where black is one lower than white, the standard move is to play one step further into white, ca
lled the monkey jump.  J1 is definately better.];W[ks];B[kr];W[is];B[jr]
;W[ir];B[sn]C[of all the gote moves, a better move is f1, because e1 would be a big sente move for white.]
;W[so];B[sm];W[qo]C[why?];B[ng];W[nh];B[li];W[lj]C[
 gideon 23k : has entered byo-yomi again];B[mg]C[unescesary and loses sente, because of liberty at K16]
;W[ol];B[om];W[cq]C[I would play this move in desperation in a high handicap game, but black can easily kill this.]
;B[cr]C[right idea, push out of corner.];W[br];B[dr];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B
