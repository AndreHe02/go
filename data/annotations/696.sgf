;B[ee]C[my favorite:)]BL[54];W[gc]C[popular reply]WL[46];B[dc]
C[e7 slightly better in that it puts much more pressure on g7
and allows a bigger black moyo on left]BL[49];W[gf]C[w could try d3 as well]
WL[40];B[dg]BL[46];W[eg]C[bad to attach here where little terr. can be made;
this allows black to cash in on his left territory with eg  d4.
wc3 would make a better attachment, but wc5 seems best, making miai of
wc3 or wc7 next]WL[38];B[ef]C[fine also]BL[42];W[fg]WL[34];B[eh]
C[bad; b shld just descend to d2, leaving no  weaknesses;
now w has better chances to mess around at c5]BL[39];W[fh]C[bad too; allows b to repair while keeping f1 as big sente move  for later]
WL[27];B[di]BL[36];W[gg]C[wasted move; shld be around d7 to try catch up in  territory]
WL[13];B[fb]C[b can easily secure over half the board now]BL[29]
;W[fc]WL[6];B[ec]BL[26];W[fd]C[g8 so much bigger]WL[297];B[ed]
C[same here]BL[10];W[fe]C[and here]WL[293];B[ff]C[and here]
BL[6];W[ge]C[remember most of territory in 9x9 is near edge!]
WL[290];B[gb]C[yes!]BL[3];W[hc]C[better block at h8]WL[280]

GS with white stones.
First of all, I don't understand if I had won or lost.
Second one, what's a byo-yomi?
How is my playing?

Many thanks for your evaluation!!!
