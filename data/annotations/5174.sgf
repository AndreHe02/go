C[Hi, my name is Hannes and I will mark my comments with H.
Review is for black.


Summary: Black would have won, if it were not for simple mistakes. In close combat, black should try to read at least two moves ahead. This is difficult, but keeping an eye on counting  liberties should help.

And black should try not to focus too much on fights that make him win or loose a few points, if there are much bigger moves (extensions, invasions) left for him to play.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[qi];B[dk]LB[ec:B][cd:A][cj:C]
[ej:D]C[H: The direction of this move is right, given A and B, but it is usually played on C (followed by D, if the opponent does not prevent that).]
;W[jq];B[jd]LB[jc:A]C[H: Again, A would be an option, but there is nothing wrong with b's move, as both players are playing on influence/moyo rather than on territory.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[cn]LB[jd:B][od:A]C[H: B should not ignore white here. Simply continuing with A would give b secure territory and make his connection to B more solid.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[rd];B[rc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[re]
LB[qb:A][rf:B]C[H: b does pretty well, here. w's escape at A is useless. Stopping b at B would be a good w move.]
;W[rb];B[sd];W[pb];B[ob];W[oa];B[na];W[pa]
(;B[sb]C[H: unnecessary move. White cannot get two eyes and is dead (see variation)

Note that unnecessary moves are lost moves.];W[ra];B[sc]C[The white group in the upper right was almost dead, but I competely forgot it in the engame :-(

H: Actually, it is dead, and you simply did not recognize the atari later. That's hard, but a simple mistake. Don't worry too much about it.]
;W[mc]
(;B[mb]LB[md:A]C[H: If black was in a more offensive mood, he could have cut at A right here. See move number 37.]
;W[rf];B[md]C[H: now, here's the cut.];W[lc]C[H: white tries to evade]

(;B[lb]C[H: black attacks from the wrong direction (see variation)]
;W[ld]
(;B[kc]LB[md:A]C[H: Black does not have to give up A. See variation]
;W[me];B[jb]LB[hd:A][cg:B]C[H: not necessary. Black looses a move here, which he could have used at A or B]
;W[sf];B[se];W[kd];B[qn]C[H: Good move];W[qo];B[qk];W[pn];B[qm]
;W[pm];B[ok]LB[pk:A][ql:B]TR[qk][qm]C[H: This shape allows w to cut either at A or B. This is no mistake by black, but something he has to keep in mind.]
;W[pl]
(;B[pk]LB[ql:A]C[H: Good choice. If black would have defended at A, he would at least be cut off by white (see variation)]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[rn];B[rm];W[rp];B[sn]C[H: This move does not help black.]
;W[ro];B[ri];W[rh];B[qj]LB[rj:A]C[H: B should have prevented white playing at A by playing there himself]
;W[rj];B[pi];W[si];B[rk];W[ph];B[oi];W[nl]TR[oj][pj]C[I wasn't too confident in saving my black group at this point


H: You're right. Black has only one eye, yet (triangled points). But he is not short of space.]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[oh];W[og];B[pg];W[qh];B[qg]C[H: Mistake, but white does not punish it (see variation)]

(;W[pf];B[ng];W[of];B[nf]LB[mh:A]C[H: Mistake again. Black should simply capture the white stone at A.]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[mg];B[ji]LB[gd:C][cg:B][ji:A][fq:D][mq:E]C[was a 2 point jump too much here?  it seemed to work well with K16

H: What would black use A for? Building a moyo in the upper left? A does not help here (see variation)

If black uses it to evade with his right group, it works.

But keep in mind that there are big points left on other areas of the board (B, C, D, or even E)]

(;B[nj]C[H: wrong side. See variation];W[mk];B[nk]LB[ml:A]C[H: If white played A here, black has only one eye, and the whole group is dead.21]

(;B[eo]LB[dl:B][dm:A]C[H: The situation will become a fight between the black A and the white B group. So black should try to defend the A-group and attack the B-group simultaneously (see variation)]

H: There is no danger in white playing A (H17). So black does not have to defend. He should simply stop white from running into his territory and play at B.]
