Hi, my name is Tim Kington and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm AGA 2d.  Feel free to mail me at timkington@gmail.com if you have any questions.]
;B[pq];W[qd];B[cp];W[po];B[qm];W[qq];B[mq];W[pr]C[This is really bad for Black.]
;B[oq];W[qp]C[White winds up with a stable group and territory, and Black gets an attackable group.]
;B[qj];W[dc];B[qg]C[This is pretty small.  Black's probably better off closing his corner.  He could grab some territory and help out the group on the bottom.]
(;W[pm]LB[kq:a]C[Trying to make the wall to attack three stones at the bottom later. Is it good strategy?

I don't think so, because you ended in gote, allowing Black to play a move at the bottom before you.  If you can do this in sente, it's a good idea.  I might go straight to A.  You can reduce Black's bottom potential easily.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[qn];W[oo];B[or];W[kq]C[This doesn't make much sense when Black can live with R2.]
;B[iq];W[lp];B[qr];W[rr];B[ps];W[kr];B[rs];W[rq];B[mr];W[fq]
C[There's a pattern throughout this game of White creating weak groups.  Each time you create a weak group, it's worth about -20 points for you.  That's how much your opponent should gain while chasing it.  There's plenty of open space in the top half of the board, and it's much more profitable to play up there somewhere.]
;B[dq];W[fo];B[io]C[This is great for Black, because White has two weak groups and Black stones are separating them.  It's hard for White to protect both sides.]
;W[cn]C[If Black splits you here, you'll have three weak groups to deal with.]
;B[cl];W[cj]C[I thought, that even if black connects, he would have to weaken J3,J5 when doing so.

This creates yet another group to worry about. J3 and J5 will be hard to capture - they have a lot of room to run and weak groups nearby to threaten.]
;B[el]
(;W[en]C[Misread here. I thought that this protects from connecting.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[bn];W[bo];B[co];W[bm];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[bl]
;B[bp]
(;W[de]LB[gn:a]C[This is dangerous.  If Black plays A, I think your stones should be captured.]

;B[fl];W[hm];B[gl];W[ho];B[in];W[hp];B[ip];W[dr];B[cr];W[es]
;B[gr];W[fr];B[fc]C[Black is asking for trouble here.  He's playing too close to thickness.  Attack the stone.]
(;W[il]LB[km:a]C[I wasn't sure if attacking F17 is more important.

When you attack a group, your goal is normally not to kill it, but to take profit.  Where is your profit going to be after this attack?  I don't think this makes sense.  A move somewhere around A would threaten to kill these stones and fix up your problems in this area.  That seems better to me.]

;W[df];B[ch];W[bg];B[ci];W[bj];B[im];W[hl];B[ki]LB[nk:a]C[Can't Black make a lot of points at A?  This seems like a problem for you.  I would want to play A immediately.]
;W[od];B[mc];W[kc]LB[hc:a]C[Creating yet another weak group. A would be better connected to your stones below, and threatening a weaker stone.]

I see two major problems in this game.  One is that you're creating weak groups without thinking about how the opponent is going to use them against you.  When you're attacking your opponent's groups, you want to think about where your profit is going to come from - don't attack just because they're weak.

The other is the missed ladders. Watch out for those - any time there are key stones you want to capture, first you should look for a net, and then you should look for a ladder.

In the end, you made a bad shape move that lost the game.  I think if you continue into the center and stay connected, you could pull this one out.]
