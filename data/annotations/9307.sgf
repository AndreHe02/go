C[### Much as you stated in the review request, I see an issue w/ attack and defense in your game.  Playing helps this, as would a problem collection, and reading commented games.  You could also try a book or maybe find some stuff on the web.   

Attack and defense in general is about identifying weak stones / strong stones, moves that take advantage of the weak ones, and settling your stones / escaping.]

TR[nc]C[### This is a bit slow, it basically says, "I'm gonna connect unless you have fallen asleep."   When black blocks, your shape has a defect @ B3.  I would want to get a stone @ O17 instead.]
;B[bo];W[bq]TR[nc]C[### The end result of the B4 move is the same position, but now it's your opponents turn.  Maybe a 15 point loss if I had to guess.  White should have left the B3 defect here and played 017.]
;B[fp];W[cn]C[### "Hey black, there is something wrong with your shape"]
;B[co]C[### Black fixes and you loose a Ko threat.  The white stones are now heavier then before.]
;W[fr]C[### Very small, worth maybe 2 points, 017, still huge.  Maybe worth 15 points.]
;B[gq]C[### Black need not have responded];W[qj]C[### Very good move, I like 017 personally but this is still an excellent play.]
;B[qm];W[qg];B[nc];W[di]C[### This was a good plan, to help out the two stones and extend from your corner.]
;B[cf]TR[di][cm][cn]C[### Black overplay, normally white c15, but the marked group is weak against the black wall.   I would pincer at c12 to strengthen the marked group and attack the black stone.]
