;W[pe]C[E: Usually san-san is good as it is. Why not go for shimary for C16 stone?]
;B[di]
(;W[ed]C[E: While it's generally good to make shimari right now K3 is a focal point of the board.
"Opponent's best move is yout best move too", remember?];B[jp]
C[E: So B takes K4.]
(;W[ch]C[E: Contact play leads to mutual strenghenig. It gave B prcisely ehat it wants, strong wall.
If you wish to reduce B's influence, you should probably tryu to cap the stone.]

;B[of];W[nf];B[oe];W[od];B[ne]C[E: W's position here has too many weak points, so you'll have to dicede which stone may be ginven away.
Personally, I would defend the corner group.]

[md]C[E: A thnk you move. It's better to connect at O10 or, again, defend the corner.
Adji of the marked group migth be used later.];B[lf]
(;W[le]C[E: I'd recommend to abandom this stones since they aren't worthy now.
If they were important, one-space jump at L16 is beeter than empty triangle.
Defending the corner is still critical.];B[ke];W[kf]C[E: See comments above.]

;W[pb];B[sc];W[sa]SQ[qj][pk][rj][qi][qh][qg][qf]C[E: 0 points in gote.
At this times it is much more importnat to defend the marked group.
Unfortunately, I see no actual way to save the group (and if it runs, B encloses one third of board along the way), so you might as well play on the bottom part of the board.]
;B[jm]C[E: And looks like B was thinking the same way.];W[gk]
;B[gm];W[fm]C[E: B is in a far better position so, so mutual strenghening (result of contact play) should be not what you want.
You are far behind, so you should be more agressive.
I wonder if 2 san-san invasions would be good choiice here... ^^']

E: well, you got it. :) But this place was point of intereset even way before this move. For example, this point could have been taken instead of one of non-profitable moves pointed out before.]

C[E: Leave the dead group as it is.
On the contrary, marked group actuall can fight for it's live.

E: Some general points. Keep an eye on connectiong your weak groups and points where thay can be cut.
Don't hesitate to defend palce with too many weak links befor taking big point.
Because if you do so, opponent will continuously smash your weaknesses making his or her every move a big one.
Also, pay more attentionto which combinations makes you to keep sente. It is usually better to play them before playing bigger profitable combination that ends in gote (loss of temp).]
