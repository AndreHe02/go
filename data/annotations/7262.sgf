C[Dear reviewer,
my name is Thomas. I like to have reviewed this game.
Apparently I chose  a wrong strategy in this game, because I have weaknesses in reading skill. So my opponent could save a group that I assumed as dead.

Hi Thomas, 

My name is Philip and I am 2d KGS. You can fnd me online as cloud, or feel free to email me with any questions. I marked all my comments with R:]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[id];W[qf];B[nc]C[R: O16 is usual here. The high chinese emphasizes influence. O16 is more consistent with this strategy.]
;W[pj];B[dj];W[ed]C[I like chinese fuseki as black.. Now I have I goal to attack.]
;B[dc]LB[cl:B][df:A][jp:C]C[R: This move is not correct. If white descends to E17 then you will get a good result, but white should not do that. White can play A locally, or just leave E16 as forcing and play B or C.

Black should play A instead, and white will get a cramped result.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[dg]C[R: This is a good result for white. Black's stones are not working well together.]
;B[cn];W[fp]
(;B[ch]LB[ch:A][hq:B]C[Maybe too slow? Would it have been better to put a stone araound k3?

R: Black should play H3 directly here and start a fight. See variation.]
;W[jq]
(;B[qq]LB[gd:B][qq:A]C[Good or should  I have choosen an other place? In return of my territory white gets strong towards the center and this is not consistent with my propper strategy to attack whites e16 group.

R: You are right that you should be focusing on the E16 group, but you need to attack now. White K3 is questionable, but it removed the possibility of a black attack at H3. To get compenstation you have to follow up your move at C12. See variation.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[nr]
;W[mq];B[of];W[ph];B[ec]C[R: G16 would be a better idea.];W[gd]

(;B[jo]LB[if:B][jo:A]C[I have much doubtness about black k5. Ohterwise i don't see a better move. I strongly feel that I have to enter there before white gets a stone there.

R: This move is ok. It is hard for white to attack this stone, and it is a key point for white to expand his moyo. I would still like to attack the white group up top though. See variation.]
;W[hp];B[jl]LB[if:A][kq:B]C[R: This move doesn't really accomplish much. Locally, black should attach at B. However, Black should still attack the top stones at A.]
;W[gg];B[if];W[ic];B[jc];W[hc];B[cg]LB[cq:A]C[R: This move is very slow. Black should play at A and steal the corner.]
;W[fc];B[jb]C[R: This is a good move.];W[ih];B[mo]LB[cq:A][rd:B]
C[R: Black should play at A or B instead.];W[rd]
(;B[bp]LB[bp:A][cq:B]C[R: This is wrong. Black needs to come into the corner completely. See variation.]
;W[cq];B[hg];W[hh];B[gh]C[I didn't recognizes that the j16- j14 position is somewhat vulnerable.]
;W[mh]C[R: This is a nice move by white.];B[lf];W[kn];B[ko]
;W[jn];B[ln];W[lm];B[mm];W[ll];B[ml];W[lk]
(;B[in]C[R: This move is a mistake. Black should attach at H5 to make shape.]
;W[km]C[R: This result is very nice for black.];B[ip];W[iq]
;B[gm];W[ho];B[io];W[lp];B[lo];W[em];B[el]LB[dl:A][ql:B]C[My loosing move. I gave away c6 in the hope to get f17. But later white found a tesuji to escape. Therethore is it better to play black 75 at c8? Do you see other possibilities?

R: Play calmly here. A is fine. Also, notice that once black is stronger in the area black can play an invasion at B.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[en];B[jj]LB[dl:A]C[R: Black needs to extend at A.]
;W[ki];B[fk]C[R: Again, this should be an extension at D8. I know that your line of play is weakening the top, but it's a much risker way of playing. It seems unnecessary.]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[cm];B[fe];W[gb];B[eb];W[ge];B[ff]C[R: This is difficult for white.]

;W[jd];B[je];W[kd];B[lc];W[qc]
(;B[ol]LB[ke:B][ol:A]C[I gave the last oportunity away.

Thanks for reviewing this game.];W[ie]C[very surprisingly for me

R: I don't think this move works. See variations.

Overall, I think you played well in this game. You have a good understanding of strong/weak groups, but you should study how to get benefit from attacking. I would recommend the book Attack and Defense in the Elementary Go Series, if you don't already have it. Also, make sure you try to keep a consistent plan throughout the game. For instance, when playing the high chinese, you should strive to build influence throughout your opening. *End of comments*]
