C[Hello, I'm Sergio (porksoda, 6 kyu KGS ; 10 kyu EGF), playing as White, with 6,5 points komi.

There were a few times during this game when i wasn't really sure of my next move, and that's why I send it for reviewing. I think I played bad and that's why I lost, however i don't find my mistakes. Thank you.

csh: Hi, I'm Chris (AGA 1d). I hope I can help. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[ic]LB[kc:A][nc:B][qc:C]C[I found this move by my opponent odd, i don't know if he wanted to do the chinese opening and missclicked or he meant that move.

csh: While Black's opening doesn't follow the Chinese Opening, it does not mean that there is a move that White can make that will immediately punish his mistake.

The idea behind the Chinese Opening is that a stone played at 'A' is supposed to act as an extension from the upper left, as well as a pincer when White invades the upper right. However, since Black played closer to the upper left corner, there is more room for an invasion in the upper right corner later in the game. The point at 'B' looks like a good invasion point. If Black encloses the corner, White can extend to 'A'. If Black tries to pincer, White can attach at 'C' and take half of the corner. See the variation.

Right now, though, there are bigger points on the board.]
(;W[cf];B[fd];W[dj]TR[ic]C[csh: This trade ends up in White's favor, as the marked stone is too close to Black's corner.]
;B[oq];W[lp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr]C[Here, I don't think black should play that way, but I wasn't sure of a way of punishing him either. I considered various moves and finally went to Q4.]
;W[pp]C[csh: This move is fine. It keeps Black from making good shape.]
;B[fq]LB[op:B][rr:A]C[... and I wasn't expecting that tenuki. Surely there is a way of taking profit out of it, but i don't find it.

csh: Locally in the lower right corner, White can end up with an advantage. White can play at 'A' to get more of the corner, as well as at 'B' (like later in the game) to create a wall. Because Black didn't follow the joseki, he didn't get as good of a result in the corner. He is shut in, and with a smaller corner than he would have had.

Again, Black's mistake may not be immediately punishable. He didn't follow joseki, but it doesn't mean it's a disastrous result for him.

I think it's still more important to play in the lower left corner, instead of trying to "punish" Black's move in the lower right.]

(;W[cn]C[I extended to protect the upper side, though now i think that a cap (F5) or even tsuke at F4 would be better. In fact i capped later. What do you think?

csh: This is a little soft, but it's okay. It starts to solidify the left side of the board. I don't like the cap, and I think the tsuke at F4 forces Black to save his group. See the variations.]
;B[jp];W[op]TR[lp]C[csh: This is a good move. It helps link up to the marked stone, and it keeps Black low.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[rr];W[mq]C[csh: Even though your first instinct is to connect, this is a good move. It separates the black groups.]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[ns]LB[pj:A][dr:B]TR[fq][jp]C[csh: All the groups on the board look stable. The question is, "What should be the next move?"

I was looking at these two moves: 'A' and 'B'.

First of all, 'A' is an extension from the white wall in the lower right of the board. If White does not get this extension, then his moves in the lower right end up being overconcentrated and his moves were wasted.

The second, 'B', puts the marked stones under attack. 'A' is the bigger move. 'B' could almost be considered sente.

See the variations.]
(;W[fo]TR[cn]C[csh: This move is soft. The stone just played is duplicating effort with the marked stone.]
;B[pj]LB[hq:A]C[Here i was thinking about the best way to attack the two black stones at F3 and K4.

csh: I think it's too late. They can dive into the corner at D2, so it's going to be really hard to kill this group. If you pressure the group to make more corner territory, it's still not as big as the extension from your wall.

Locally, I think 'A' is the move that works best. You can split apart the stones into two groups. However, the extension along the righthand side of the board is much more important than anything that can be gained by attacking the F3 and K4 stones.]

(;W[iq]C[csh: A little timid. See the variation.];B[ip];W[hq]
;B[hp];W[jr];B[gp];W[kq];B[jj];W[ok]C[csh: This is where the game starts going badly for White. White's move doesn't have a clear purpose. Typically, the shoulder hit is used against stones on the third line to reduce a moyo. Here, the best that White can hope for is to make territory between the played stone and the wall in the lower right. This is the wrong way to use that wall.

See the variation for Black's response.

The biggest territory move is to enclose the lower left corner, but I don't think that's the right move, either.

Now is the time to time to invade in the upper right, instead of solidifying the outside borders of his moyo. It's still a tough invasion.]

(;B[qm]C[csh: Now, the strength of your wall is almost negated. White cannot kill this group that is pushing against the wall. White can only put pressure on it.]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[rl];B[ol];W[qj];B[pi];W[nk];B[rp]
LB[oc:A]C[csh: This should be saved for endgame. A move near 'A' would make the game hard for White.]
;W[ro];B[mm];W[nl];B[nm];W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri]
;W[rk]C[csh: White shouldn't take the stone. White gave up sente, and Black uses it to good advantage.]
;B[mi]C[csh: Now the coming invasion in the upper right has nowhere to run.]

(;W[oc]TR[pj][pi][qi][ri]C[I know black is thick, but I had to get inside the moyo or I would have no chance. However, I don't know if this is the best way of invading, or if i should reduce instead of invading. I'm also thinking that probably my mistake was playing the sequency around Q9, which caused black thickness.

csh: Oh, I read this comment after I analyzed the first part. Yes, your mistake was playing around Q9.

Generally, you should look at the game this way. What's the score? Is it close? If I reduce from the outside, is the game close enough to win?

When I look at the board (before your move) I think you are behind. You have territory along the righthand side (about 24 pts). You also have a moyo on the lefthand side of the board, (maybe 40 pts, but you won't get all of it). Black has 10 points in the corner, and maybe 15-20 points in the upper right. However, the moyo in the upper right is huge! I think you judged correctly. You need to invade. The crosscut joseki no longer works because of the marked stones. See the variation.]
;B[mc];W[qc]C[Trying to establish the group.];B[rc];W[pd];B[qb]
C[csh: I think you have to play for the ko.]
(;W[qe]TR[mc][pj][pi][qi][ri]C[csh: This is a move to create a light shape, but White is already surrounded. It's a joseki, but only when the marked stones are not present.]

;W[sp]C[Here is one of my mistakes, i thought I could kill the whole group, but it didn't turn out well.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[ps];W[sr]C[csh: Assuming that you could read ahead that the group was not dead, this is merely an endgame move. The group in the upper left is more important. You could run into a case where the life or death of the group in the upper left is bigger than killing the group in the lower right. "Forcing" moves like this is a bad habit.]

csh: Well, you lost because of both. No one mistake was to blame for the loss, but there are definitely things that could have gone better.

1) A better sense of the early middlegame will keep you from being behind, needing to start the desperate invasion in the upper right.

2) Invading in the upper right before solidifying the black wall would have made the invasion easier.

3) Trusting your endgame will help you win games, instead of losing by making more and more desperate moves.

I hope you find this review helpful.
