C[unix [4k\]: hi

Hi Dan. An interesting game. I think overall you got caught up attacking white's group on the upper side when you had some simpler moves at that stage of the opening. Thanks for the chance to review it.
Paul];B[pc]C[Hi, thanks for reviewing. I'm black here. It ended up being a close game (or would have been close with komi). I was just looking for general advice about my play or if you see places where I could have done better. I left a couple comments and questions about moves I was unsure about.]

(;B[hc]C[not sure about this move, my idea was to put pressure on the k17 group

I think there are two important issues to focus on:
The first is protecting the corner since you have a 2-space enclosure.
The next issue is dealing with white's potential on the left side.

Since there is a 2-space gap to the right of the upper white group I don't think you can bring too much pressure against it right now.
Also the relation of this move to the F-17 stone is cramped and I'm not at all sure that the corner is now secured.]

The marked white stone on the right is much too close to black's thickness.]

I think there are clear gains to be had on the right side. The attack however is unclear to me. Of course if you capture the group you win the game but if you don't then you are risking ending up in a bad position.]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[jd];B[mg];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh]C[was this too aggressive? Is there a more solid move, or is it better to try and seal white in?]

I think the fight will revolve around the relative strengths of the marked stones.
White has the potential to build a large center whereas you have few prospects for territory there.]
