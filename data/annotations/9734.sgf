C[Dear reviewer, I'd be happy if you could have a look at the questions I have put into the game comments and also tell me if you see something that I could have done better, or things where I played very sub-optimum.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep];W[dj]C[Q: Here I had the feeling that staying away from y attack is not a good idea. My answer now seems weak to me. Would one of the options be stronger?]

(;B[hp];W[jd];B[lc];W[jj];B[le]CR[ec][fc][pf][qf][pg][qg][pj]
[qj][pm][qm][pn][qn][lp][np][dq][lq][nq]C[PM-  Reaching into the center is a little premature here.  Consider the marked points as alternative plays here.  Although both of us are probably not strong enough to really start worrying seriously about fuseki shapes, if you can remember to prioritize corner->sides>center you'll get to single-digit kyus pretty fast.]
;W[pj]C[PM-  Here we see white can safely ignore your reach into the center to spoil your potential territory on the eastern side.]

(;B[gd]C[Q: I think this is a good result for black at the top, but were my moves to get here OK, or did white mess it up?

PM-  See variation];W[fe];B[cl];W[ck]
(;B[cn]C[PM-  A more normal response to being attached diagonally is to extend.  See variation.  Keep in mind that your two-space jump on the third line is not wide enough to ensure life, meaning you're consigning your shape to have to escape toward the center without actually making any movement in this direction.  See variation.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[dr]
(;B[en]CR[do]C[PM- This shape should always be avoided because of the tempting white play at the marked point.]
;W[jm];B[lq];W[nn]C[Should I have played somewhere into the centre? Reacted to white taking tengen and playing stones loosely everywhere? Or is it better to get influence on three sides as I did?]
;B[np];W[og]
(;B[lm]CR[lo]TR[cc][oc][od][pe][dg][pg][bj][dl][pn]C[PM-  It looks like you're trying to spoil terrotiry in the center.  Rember!  There is no territory in the center!  Plays for the corners and sides are worth many more points at this stage of the game.  Also note the tempting white cut at the circled point.]

;W[jp];B[jo];W[kp];B[lp];W[kq]C[Q: was it move 41 that made it possible for white to build this territory-reducing tower?

PM-  Yes, you reached too far in a direction that was meant to take away non-existant territory from white when you should have been solidifying your own territory while simultaneously reducing white's.]
;B[ir]
(;W[kr]SQ[cc][oc][qc][ce][qe][cg][dg][ci][qn][qo][qq]C[Q: I think this is wrong, he should have pleyed f2 or something like that

PM-  Maybe, but the fact that you left the gap at E2 means white can invade there at his/her leisure, knowing that if you take the turn to defend at E2 white will have a free play elsewhere.  Better to not get into that situation in the first place.  White, like Black, is getting caught up in close fighting and forgetting about big point plays still left on the board, see marked points.  These should be played before the kind of end-game fighting you're doing right now.  Losing a point here has to be weighed against potentially losing 20 elsewhere.]
;B[lr];W[ls];B[ms];W[ks];B[nr]LB[mr:A]SQ[lo][mo][lp][np][lq]
[lr]C[PM- Given the precarious situation of your marked group, I would have preferred the more solid connection at "A"]
;W[fl];B[ap]CR[cc][nd][ce][qe][lf][mg][mn][qn][qo]LB[bo:A]TR[co]
[dp][bq][br][er][cs]C[PM-  The first line means death!  Consider the obvious cutting move for white, marked "A".  Also, as a reminder, see the circled points that are more urgent, and also the triangle points that are more believable attacks on the corner.]
;W[bq]
(;B[bp]C[PM- oops.  Another thing to remember to avoid to make it easy to get to single-digit kyu-  Never let yourself be left with just two liberties on the second line.  White's obvoius follow-up means black can't escape.]
;W[aq];B[co];W[bo];B[dp];W[cq];B[er];W[es];B[fs];W[ds];B[gr]
C[PM-  Again, this is a fancy connection to make, but don't make it a habit.  The soild connection should be considered when the group you're connecting is part of an unresolved conflict.]

PM-  Theoretically, yes, this can work, if YOU play incorrectly.  White would not have tried this invasion if you had moved at any of the marked points previously.  Bear in mind I mean if you had played any of those points -instead- of one of the points you already played, not in addition to.]

Black: 87 territories + 2*7 dead stones(W) + 1 prisoner = 102
Result: W+8.5

PM-  So, You lost by 8 points plus komi.  There are a few things you could have done to end up with 9 more points than you did.  If white hadn't attempted the corner invasion in the southeast, the margin of loss would have been six higher.  In general you don't want to make the assumption that the opponent will play badly part of your strategy.  There were a lot of moves that were more urgent than the ones you made that I've marked throughougt this review.  

It's ironic that I stated earlier in the review that there is "no territory in the center", and here we see white seems to have a large amount of territory in the center.  The reason "there is no territory in the center" is an axiom of the game is because territory in the center is very difficult to defend, since you have to defend it from multiple sides.  Because of the gaps left in your shape by getting involved in middle-to-endgame fighting instead of securing territory, white was able to make huge gains in the center by threatening the weak points of your shapes, forcing you to crawl along the third and second lines.  Your goal shouldn't necessarily be to -surround- the center, but to keep open the possibility of -inflluencing- the center.  This is very hard to do if your shapes are fighting for life, so secure life for your shapes first before attempting to influence the center.  Do this by extending in a direction that -limits- the territory availible for white to surround.  

Remember to always play calmly when you're pleying black against white.  White's role is always to get you involved in complicated fights that white's supperior experience will carry him/her through, while black's natural advantage in going first or receiving a handicap is erased by blindly charging in.  Even with no handicap, use the fact that you get to move first (which is a positive handicap in the absence of komi) to connect lightly and avoid conflict until you have made solid territory.  If the outcome of a fight is only worth one or two points in either sides territory, leave that part of the board to strike out into the empty space and return to the 1-2 point fight in the endgame.  It's very easy to become locked-in and hyper focused on a fight happening in one section of the board, but remember that the game is being played accross the whole board simultaneously.

You will quickly attain single digit kyu if you remind yourself of a few key concepts in a disciplined manner with every turn you take:

1)  Corners first, then sides, then center.
2)  Play to make your weakest stone/group stronger and your opponent's weakest stone/group weaker
3)  Make the moves that are worth the highest number of points first
4)  Gain territory and deny territory with the same move.])
