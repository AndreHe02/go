;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[ed];B[nj]C[This move is not very good.  You should have played at Q10, which is called the San Ren Sei opening (it means, three consecutive Star points).]
;W[cd];B[mc]C[D10 would have been very good, to split white.]
;W[jq];B[lf]C[N3 would have reacted better to his last move, while your move is a bit vague.]
;W[cj];B[jb]C[This is another vague move - You should have played either E4, F4, or a capping move at E10.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[hc];B[jd]C[This was a good move in reaction to white.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[op];B[om];W[mm];B[ha]C[No point in playing this.  It is an endgame move.  Instead, you should have played in white's zone of influence...]
;W[hb];B[ia];W[fb];B[en]C[Better at E4, because it lets you get closer to the edge, with more chance of getting eyes.]
;W[ie];B[je];W[eq];B[dl];W[cl];B[fl];W[fo];B[ej];W[hl];B[gi]
;W[ff];B[hk];W[il];B[ik];W[rg];B[qg]C[The contact move is not very good.  You could have played at R14.  You need to accept that W will get territory, and limit it as much as you can, while reinforcing yourself.]
;W[qd];B[qc]C[Was R17 the best move here?

I think R15 would have put more pressure on white, he would probably have taken the corner, and you would have gotten the side.  But it is not a bad move.]
;W[qe];B[rd]C[Q15 would be better.];W[re];B[rc];W[qf];B[sd]
C[No need to play this.];W[se];B[rh];W[qh];B[sg];W[pg]C[Complete brain lapse for black there.  Did it really turn the tide of the game as much as I think it did?

Yes, because now white not only lives, but also gets out into your moyo (zone of influence).]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[sf]C[No point playing this.];W[ri];B[og];W[ql]
;B[qk];W[pm];B[ol];W[pn];B[qo];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[qp];W[qn]
;B[qj]C[Q3 would have probably saved the bottom group.];W[rk]
;B[oj];W[hh];B[qi];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[of];W[rj];B[pl];W[rm]
;B[nk];W[pq];B[qq]C[Would I have been better off saving the black group in lower right, or containing the live group in my upper right?

It was too late to save the bottom group.  O12 would have been a great move.]

;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[dj]C[Would C9 have been a better move here?

Definately.  Always push through when you can.  This gets you nothing.]
;W[ck];B[bd]C[Should I have advanced along 19 from H inward before committing to the corner?

No, you have more chance of living like this.  If you pushed on 19, W would have gotten more reinforcements.]

;W[eb];B[bb];W[ad];B[ab];W[ca];B[tt];W[tt]C[You need to really learn the basics, but that is understandable since you are a beginner.  A couple of books can help - Graded go problems for beginners, vol. 1; Opening Theory made Easy (if it is still in print); and Proverbs (published by Yutopian) will give you good groundings.  Also, Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go is a classic, and should be read and reread.  But above all, the problem book to let you try and figure out what you should be doing.

Good luck, and don't get discouraged!])
