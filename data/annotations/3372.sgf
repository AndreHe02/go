C[Thank you for letting me review your game. I am currently around 7k in the Netherlands.

I hope my review will be of some help. I have marked my comments with 'D:' so you will know which are mine and which are yours.

I tend to designate Black with 'he' and White with 'she'. This has of course no relation with the gender of the players.]
;B[dp]C[[Tom\] Hello, I'm Tom and I'm playing black.];W[pd]
C[[Wim\] Hi, I'm Wim. I'm playing white.];B[dd];W[pp];B[nq]
LB[dj:A]C[[Tom\] I'm a always wondering if maybe this is a little premature and too audacious so early in the game without any support of e.g. K4. However, this move (and especially move 7) seems to have made it possible for me to maintain the side.

D: There is nothing wrong with approaching the 44 point with a move like O3. Actually, this move is quite logical. Another option would be to play at A and start building a large framework with a san-ren-sei opening.]
;W[pn]
(;B[jp]LB[lq:A]C[[Tom\] This move allowed me to strenghten the side.

D: This might be a bit too far. White could try invading at A and will probably succeed, especially with a few more stones around. Black is leaving a weakness behind.]
;W[jd];B[pj]C[[Tom\] I'm not planning on giving white the whole side, so I played this stone. However it seems that I neglected this stone too much (see later moves) until it was too late...

D: It's OK to give up light stones later, when they are of no use anymore. However, once you start adding stones here, you are increasing their worth and you will have to increase your efforts to save them.]
;W[pg]TR[pj]C[[Wim\] I'm feeling too pressured here from black's aggressive fuseki...

D: You are exerting a lot of pressure on the marked stone yourself.
Black might be spreading his stones all over the board, but he will be left with weak stones that you get to attack and take profit from later.]
;B[hc]C[[Tom\] Playing D10 should have been better now I think, correct?

D: Playing D10 is a big move. H17 seems a bit awkward, though playable. If you are looking for a strong, solid move. D10 is a very good choice.]
;W[ol]C[[Wim\] Is this a good reaction to black's moves?

D: Perhaps. You could consider moving into the left side before Black gets to play there. The longer you wait the more difficult it becomes to keep black from building a big moyo on the left.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[pr];W[rp];B[rq];W[so];B[or]
;W[oj];B[oo];W[po];B[mn]TR[lc][mc][ld][md]C[D: Seems too small. Strengthening your left would be big or else a reduction of white's framework. Maybe somewhere around the marked area. You will probably get a good fight there.]
;W[cf];B[ce]
(;W[ef];B[dj];W[he]
(;B[rr]C[[Tom\] This is a wasted move I think, but at the time I played this stone, I wasn't sure if white would gain when playing there.

D: Indeed. See the alternative for what happens when white plays at S2.]
;W[ch]TR[cq]C[D: Seems a bit small. The 33 point invasion is looking good now.]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[bf];W[de];B[be];W[dc]C[[Wim\] An attempt to break black's shape...

D: Looks good. You are pressurizing black. Maybe E17 or F17 gives you a slightly stronger position. If you manage to capture H17 you have a very promising position at the top.]
;B[ee];W[df];B[fe]
(;W[cd];B[ed];W[bd];B[bg];W[bh];B[cc]C[[Wim\] ... but it backfires. Was it played too closely?]
;W[bc];B[cb]
(;W[db];B[bb]C[[Tom\] What a race to the corner!];W[ff];B[qh]
TR[pg][oj][ol]C[[Tom\] Thinking about moving into the center or reinforcing the starpoint at D4 should have been better I think.

D: Your Q10 stone is very weak. White made three moves in response to it. I think your best chance would be to use it as a threat while limiting white's framework. Even if you live, white can get a good result from it.

You could also play the 33-point invasion around now. Defending your own corner might be better though.]
;W[pi];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[cq]C[[Wim\] I grow tired of my moyo being invaded an try one myself.

D: This is interesting. Black has a pretty good move with O17; the top right hasn't been settled yet. However, black has to respond to your invasion and you should be able to end it with sente, though there are sequences that give black sente. That would be very bad for your position at the top.]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr]C[D: F3 is another (good) option. This way you give white a ponuki on the side. However, your strong position on the right greatly limits white's potential. F2 seems a good choice.]
;W[fq]
(;B[bq]C[D: Peculiar.];W[ep];B[gr];W[gq];B[hr];W[hq];B[iq];W[bo]
;B[bp]C[[Tom\] White delivered me quite a blow with move 76, losing substantial influence on the side and corner.

D: Indeed. You will have to put pressure on the white stones at the bottom to regain something. B3 was probably not a very good choice.]
;W[co];B[cr];W[dr];B[dm]C[[Tom\] Trying to save my stones around D4 would cost me more than trying to keep a part of the side so I tried to propose a trade here with this move.

D: You don't have a lot on the side, it is still very much open. white can easily play at A8 or A9 (large monkey jump) or even higher. Your D4 stones are worth at least 20 points.]
;W[do];B[fo]C[D: You could think about taking some profit at the top. O17 seems big.]
;W[eo];B[ge]TR[nc][ar]C[[Wim\] At this moment I wonder... what are the big points now on the board?

D: Probably not this.
I think A2 gives you a ko for life. It is worth at least 20 points.
You could attempt to live on the right side though that would be very difficult. Using them to take some of the center from white seems like another good idea.]
;W[gf];B[hd];W[nc]C[D: Important.];B[nb]
(;W[mb]TR[mc]C[D: The triangled move is more usual. N18 could lead to complications for white, though she has a strong position. White leaves a lot of cutting points behind with the hane while a black play at N18 isn't worth a lot.]
;B[rd];W[pa]C[[Wim\] Is it possible to stop a 3-3 invasion?

D: Usually not. But you shouldn't expect to get the corner when you play at the 4-4 point. If you want the corner, play either at 4-3 (though you are still aiming more at the side) or even at 3-3.
The 3-3 point invasion is usually a sure way to get the corner, but white gets a lot in return. Timing is crucial with this invasion and you should take care not to play it too early.]
;B[pb];W[qa]
(;B[qf];W[re]C[[Wim\] Trying to keep black's stones separated.]
;B[sd]C[[Tom\] Move 96 of white is a very nice one I think - splitting my territory in two.

D: I wouldn't have called those stones on the right 'territory' ;-)]
;W[qe];B[rb];W[sc];B[qi];W[qg];B[ql]C[[Tom\] Desperately trying to make life where there's little chance to I think.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[qj];B[rj];W[pf];B[rg];W[rf];B[sh];W[ph];B[si]
;W[rl]
(;B[pl]TR[ci][dj][dm][fo]C[[Tom\] I should have noticed that there was no future anymore in the stones on this side. The thing that troubles me a great deal when looking at the current board layout is that white seems to have tremendous control in the center right now and a cautious invasion from the side would probably don't to much good either.

D: I think white gave you ample opportunity to live.
You are right to say white has enormous influence in the center. Reducing her territory there will be very difficult. Your marked stones are weak and will allow for white to get good profit regardless of your line of play.]
;W[rk];B[pj];W[se];B[rc];W[qj];B[bm];W[cm];B[cl]C[[Wim\] I expected this attack on the other side (D6), but this turns out more favorably for me.]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[dl];B[ao];W[br];B[aq]C[[Tom\] Ouch! Bad move! :-)]
;W[ar];B[ck];W[di];B[el];W[bi];B[cj];W[em];B[dk];W[fn]C[[Wim\] Trying to keep a way into the center open for this cluster.

D: I'd just take good profit in the center, possibly while putting pressure on black's lump of stones at D9. 
Playing at tengen is already very big.];B[ek]C[[Tom\] I'm not very happy with this move either.

D: Good observation. This move doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't give you any eyes, nor does it hurt white. Think big!]
;W[gi]C[D: Very solid, maybe you could try something even bigger.]
;B[fm]C[D: Again, too small (I hope you don't mind me repeating this, it's just very vital to keep thinking big. White is aiming at a lot of territory in the center and the longer you wait, the stronger she becomes.]
;W[en];B[bj];W[ok]TR[jj][kj][lj][jk][kk][lk][jl][kl][ll]C[[Wim\] Black has living groups in 3 corners so I'm going to have a hard to time to win. I must focus using the strength of the white G14 and Q14 clusters to gain almost all center territory to be able to win.

D: Let us try to count, roughly. Please note that counting is not my strong point though.

Black has:
30 points in the top left
10 point in the top right
30 points at the bottom
5 points at the left
Total: about 75 points

White has:
33 points at the right
17 points at the bottom left
About 50 points in the center
Total: about 100 points.

White is leading comfortably. If you keep up the good play and manage to solidify your center territory you have an easy win from now on.

P9 is a rather wasted move. Somewhere around the marked area would seem like a good idea. Maybe A8 to force black to get another eye for his group elsewhere? It might even be sente.]
;B[jc];W[ll]C[[Wim\] I think this is a very big move. Is that right or is there a better one now?

D: Indeed very big. However, K17 has a lot of potential, especially with the cut at N17.]
;B[gm]C[Much too slow.];W[hk];B[gk];W[gj];B[hl];W[fk];B[fl]
;W[gl]C[D: Think big! This is too small.];B[in];W[il];B[hm]
;W[im]C[[Wim\] Should I focus more here on defending the weak points in my recent clusters (around G9)?

D: Defending when you are ahead is a good idea. 'A rich man shouldn't pick quarrels' or so they say.
Your top side looks weak and could use another stone (L16 perhaps?)]
;B[gn]C[D: I am sorry for repeating this but this move is much too small. Black is behind a lot. Somewhere around L16 looks very promising.]
;W[go];B[ho]C[[Tom\] All this effort to give my group life (but in return for very little territory) while allowing white to strenghten the influence in the center is a bad thing I guess.

D: If white keeps you from connecting, doesn't A8 give you life?]
;W[gp];B[ie]C[[Tom\] Actually, just now I start realising I should probably be doing something about this big opening in the center and that this may very well be my last chance.

[Wim\] I was afraid this attack might come, but I didn't want to leave the F3 clusters below alone. Should I have moved there sooner myself?

D: Another good choice for an invasion. This will hurt white a lot.
White should indeed have done something here earlier. The F3 cluster looks perfectly fine. You can always capture at A4.]
;W[if];B[je];W[kd];B[jf];W[hf];B[id]C[[Tom\] Let's keep playing safe...]
;W[kf]C[[Tom\] But playing it safe allows me to be boxed in a little more.

[Wim\] How should I react?

D: Black can take away a lot from white. I can't really give good advice on how to play here. There are just too many possibilities. However, I think I would have begun pushing into the center further. That is where the bulk of white's (potential) territory is.]

(;B[ke];W[le];B[ld];W[kg];B[mc]C[[Tom\] Should I have kept going at the center instead of this instead?

D: I think the center might have been better, you could still have come back for the cut at N17. It is hard to say for sure though. This gives you a lot of points as well.]
;W[md];B[lc];W[ne];B[jg];W[jh];B[lf];W[me];B[lg];W[kh];B[od]
;W[nd];B[nm]C[[Tom\] Let's try the other side.

D: You might consider leaving the top open a bit more when you want to try to invade from the other side as well. That way you threaten more with every move.O7 also seems a little slow. You have to risk a lot now.]
;W[kn];B[om];W[pm];B[jm];W[jn];B[ik];W[jl];B[gk];W[hj];B[fj]
;W[fi];B[ei];W[eh];B[ej]C[D: This is worth perhaps one point.]
;W[io];B[jo];W[nl];B[jk];W[hn];B[kl];W[in];B[lk];W[km]
(;B[kk]C[[Tom\] I would never have been able to save these stones in the center anyways, so I should have left these for dead already some time ago I think.

D: I agree. There is quite some aji left in them, but this only makes them heavier.]
;W[ig]TR[lo]C[[Wim\] Is this good?

D: It's not very big and it is gote. There could well be other moves left that are bigger. M5 for example.]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[ip]C[[Wim\] In my opinion, black N9 or N7 is a better move here.

D: This doesn't accomplish a lot for Black. But N7 isn't worth too much either. M5 seems biggest.]
;W[mm];B[mk];W[nn]C[[Wim\] Black now allows this sequence.]
;B[on];W[no];B[op];W[np];B[oq];W[mo];B[mp]C[[Tom\] Setting up a new perimeter since I let white get this far.]
;W[lo];B[lp];W[lh]C[[Wim\] Again, I think these 2 black stones need to be separated, because they could cause trouble when used together with black's big L9 cluster, right?

D: I don't think there is too much to worry about, but better safe than sorry. Just don't complain when you end up losing by one point :)]
;B[ko];W[ln];B[hp];W[mg];B[ai];W[ae];B[ac];W[cg];B[ah]C[[Tom\] Bad idea to play this stone.

D: Very intruiging position.];W[fs];B[gs]

(;W[ak];B[al];W[sq];B[sr];W[sp];B[bk];W[ai];B[an];W[ap]C[[Wim\] In my eyes, the game is now finished. I have a lot of prisoners, so I know I have won.]
;B[sm]C[[Tom\] Ok, I admit, this is just plain dumb to play here. I apologise for this one, I should've seen there was nothing to gain anymore.]

[Tom\] I wonder where things went wrong for me. Personally I think there are several flaws in my play:
* Slowly allowing white to go for the center.
* Wasting a lot of stones on the group around D10.
* Creating shape that is just too solid.
* Trying too desperately to save lost causes.
* ...
Anyways, I really enjoyed this game and hope to learn from it for future games.

D: I think B3 lost you a lot of points. Also, I think white gave you a few chances on the right to safe your group, that would have been quite big.
For the rest your play was pretty decent except for allowing white such a big center. You should have begun reducing her center much sooner.
With your reasonable framework at the bottom it wouldn't have hurt to secure the bottom left corner either.

White played a very solid game. I think the biggest problems occured at the top. N18 wasn't a very good move and it wouldn't have hurt to defend against black's pushing a bit earlier.

Thank you for letting me review this game. If you have further questions or if something I wrote is unclear, please don't hesistate to ask.
At some points you asked me to point out other possible moves. I found this a bit difficult considering the number of possibilities that were available. However, I think the moves you played there were usually quite good or else they were (hopefully now obviously) too slow, but that I have indicated on several occassions.]
