[ro]L[qk][nq]C[jc> I prefer the double kakari at O3  for whites next move as R9 just makes black stronger in an attempt to rescue  a single weak stone.]

(;W[qk]C[jc> white is just making black  strong by playing here.  White should treat the R7 stone lightly.]
;B[qj];W[om];B[no]C[jc> O5 should be at O4.  Despite this, black is building up strength  while white is struggling to make his stones on the side live.  This is bad  for white.]

;W[kl];B[jk];W[hj];B[gm]C[jc> black G7 is bad.  It erases the possibility of black  cutting at F7, wastes a ko threat and strenghtens white.

blacks move would be much better spent at Q14 or R14 which would strengthen  his weakest group (the Q10 O10 stones).]
;W[fm];B[gl];W[hk]C[jc> black  strengthens white while gaining nothing...]

;W[pk];B[oj];W[mh];B[og];W[lg];B[pf]C[jc> white got good influence in  the middle for the stones he sacrificed.  The downside of this variation (as  compared with white playing M16 at M13) is that black gets to connect up his  center group so now white has no weak groups to attack.]
;W[cf];B[di];W[bh];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]L[bk][fg]C[jc> Since white has gone to all the  trouble of building the influence in the center he should continue building  his moyo with F13.  F13 helps connect up whites weakest group (F10 group)  while starting a big house at the top.]
;W[bk]C[jc> this invasion is very  risky and should be saved for later in the game when there aren't as many big  points around.]
;B[aj];W[ak];B[ck];W[cm];B[dm];W[co];B[do];W[bl]L[cn][bm]C[jc> black  misses a killing tesuji here.  White has made an "empty triangle" shape with  the B8 group.  This should be a sign post to black saying "STOP - look for  weakness".  Variation B shows how to attack the empty triangle.]

;B[cj];W[co];B[dc];W[bo];B[fc]C[jc> white is lucky that his  invasion worked.  even so, he has paid a large price by allowing D17 and F17.     Contrast this with black only getting one move in this area and white having  a stone at F13 (the variation of white F13 instead of white B9).]
