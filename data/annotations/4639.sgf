;B[pp]C[MM:  I am Mike Malveaux, AGA -6, "wegobad" on go servers, reviewing this game for the GTL.  White requested the review, so White's moves will be my main focus.  Please email wegobad@hilltopgo.com with questions or comments -- especially if you find some of my mistakes.]
;W[cc]C[I was trying out the 3-3 start.  I don't usually play it.  It seems slow.

MM:  It's good to try unfamiliar moves now and then, though maybe not in tournament games where rating points or rent money is at stake.  Some very strong professionals such as Cho Chikun and Go Seigen have used the 3-3 to good effect.

Perhaps it helps, when something feels "slow", to think of it as "thick" instead.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?33Point for more.];B[dp];W[pd];B[dd]
C[MM:  Interesting.  I think I would have played K4 instead, or R11.  Or if I were feeling experimental, the K10 center point.]
;W[cd]TR[dc]C[MM:  I'm not completely certain, but my feeling is White should slide the other way -- D17 not C16.  It seems to work better with the #4 at Q16.   A snippet at SL seems to support my feeling:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointShoulderhitWhichWayToPush
(saying 6@C16 works better if there's a Black stone on the Q16 star point)]
;B[df]C[I wasn't expecting a one point jump. Should I have cut instead?

MM:  The jump is unusual, but seen sometimes when Black wants "thick influence in the center", according to SL
http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointShoulderHit
(jump variations, near the bottom of the page).  I copy out some variations from Kogo's Joseki Dictionary (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm)]

(;W[dc]TR[ed]C[MM:  To answer your question about cutting at D15 -- it's one of the two continuations given in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm).  Simply pushing again at C15 is also ok, and seen in pro games, according to SL.

Apparently the "normal" White 8 for this situation would be a clamp at E16.  I did not see much detail on it at SL.  Kogo's shows more; go back a move to see in the variations.

Your D17 looks like such good shape that it's probably what I would have played.  Kogo's does not list it, though, so there's probably some reason it is inferior to E16.]
;B[ed];W[bf]TR[ce]C[MM:  This seems too low.  If I'm looking at it right, Kogo's recommends C15.]
;B[cg];W[fp];B[fq];W[gq];B[eq];W[gp]TR[kq][nq]C[I think H4 would have been better and then I could have follow with M3.

MM:  I don't see much difference.   H4 would leave Black the peep at G5.  H4 then M3 might be a bit of an overreach; maybe better to play thickly with L3, then O3 if you can get it.]
;B[dm]C[MM:  To me, this seems too ambitious, since Black is open at B13.]
;W[jq]TR[kq]C[MM:  This would be right higher in the center of the board.  Here on the third line, K3 is too close.  The properly efficient extension would be to L3.]
;B[mq]C[MM:  Seems a bit loose, with White strong around J3.  I suppose Black is depriving White of the next good extension.]
;W[qj]TR[qk]C[MM:  Here, I would rather see R9, because it can make an ideal extension at R6 (which threatens a 3-3 invasion at R3).]
;B[nc];W[lc];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[qe]TR[pb]C[MM:  Odd, this usually would be at Q18.]

(;W[pf]C[Did I need to extend 4 or should I have haned at R14?

MM:  I believe the R14 hane was safe, especially since R10 is in place already (back one for variations).]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[ql]C[MM:  This really seems loose to me.]

[rr][qr][qq][rq][sq][sp][bo]C[MM:  Makes nice territory; almost links the M17s to the D17s.  A more aggressive player probably would have taken R6/Q6, or maybe something near C10 (threatens to link to B14).  A more conservative player might take R14 -- solid, though not quite sente vs. the corner.  I think I would have played F17 myself.

W: 45+6.5=51.5
B: 75
If my estimate of likely territories is correct, right now White is behind by roughly 25.  Black is still open to invasion around C3, C10 and R3/R6, so the game is not lost yet.]
;B[jc]C[MM:  Bold fighting spirit; but this seems suicidal, so close to White's P17 strength.]
;W[he]C[MM:  Good.  Maybe J15 or J16 is more severe?];B[je]
;W[le]TR[hg]C[MM:  Wrong side, I think.  H13 seems better.  Even if Black manages to make a small living group around the L16 area, it won't threaten the big wall once you turn at R14; and the influence you make in fighting will be more than enough to compensate in the center and around C10.]
;B[jg]
(;W[ec]TR[gd]C[MM:  You want to make sure your #34 at H17 and #36 at H15 don't die, now that Black has poked out to safety in the center.   That's a good thing to be concerned about.

First consider pushing again with H13 -- the three running Blacks really are not strong yet, so it will be sente.  Also consider F17 instead of this E17.  (If Black plays the double peep at G16 now, you will have an awful choice:  H16 or G17?  Answering at J16 seems to just postpone the choice.  But if #40 were at F17, White G16 loses its power to cut, thanks to the nearness of the side of the board.)  Also consider that you probably can connect H17 to M17 -- back one for variations -- and maybe you won't be too worried.]
;B[qp]C[MM:  Thick.  Good for Black locally.  Probably it's more important to settle the three running stones.]
;W[cl]TR[ci][cn]C[MM:  Right idea, wrong spot I think.  D8 cannot easily connect to B14, so it's less for Black to worry about than if you had invaded at C11 for example.  And D8 is not close enough to the corner and your F4 to take advantage of the possibilities there (consider instead C6, for example).  Maybe this is the losing move?]
;B[cj]C[MM:  Good, closing the gap, and depriving White of a base.]
;W[dl]TR[cm]C[MM:  Probably better at C7?  Though maybe this can run into the center.]
;B[cm];W[em]TR[el][fl]C[MM:  Leaves a severe cutting point at E8.  Much better to push to E8 or jump to F8.  Probably this is the losing move, not #42 at C8.]
;B[el];W[fl];B[ek];W[fm]TR[jc][je][jg]C[MM:  Losing the C8-D8 invaders is harsh, but what's worse is this sequence helped the three Black K15 runners a *lot*, and White's prospects around the C3 corner are much reduced now that Black is stronger in that area.]
;B[bg];W[qf]TR[hg][hh][gg][gh][ih][ki]C[MM:  Worth about 10 points, I think; you need much more.  Better to play something near H12, if you think you can capture the three Blacks; or maybe L11 if you would rather chase them toward the D12 area, so you can get walls to claim the J7 area.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[se];W[lg]C[MM:  Wrong side, if you think you can kill; not enough pressure, if you want to chase.  This way, Black can just jump to K11, destroying your potential center.]
;B[hg];W[pk]TR[if][fd][kj]C[MM:  Maybe ok; reactivates R6 as a threat, so it's probably sente; and it claims a bit of territory.  I think J14 is bigger, or maybe F16 or something near L10.]
;B[pl];W[oq]C[Too deep!!! What was I thinking?  Would a shoulder hit at  O4 be acceptable?

MM:  I'm not sure this is too deep.  You can either live in the corner, or connect to K3, right?

The O4 shoulder hit is inside Black's sector line from N3 to Q8; I think White would be at a disadvantage if Black fought back with M5 or N4.  O5 or M4 is probably better.]
;B[op];W[nq];B[np];W[mr];B[lr];W[lq];B[mp]
(;W[kr]C[MM:  This looks like a mistake.  O2 is better.  Black has no ladder.]
;B[nr];W[ms];B[or]TR[if]C[MM:  Too bad to give Black such a big corner when you didn't need to.  Now is a good time to play the double peep at J14, I think.]
;W[lp];B[lb];W[mb];B[oa];W[nb]C[MM:  Good answer to Black's devious attempts at reduction.  I think I would have played N17 for better shape; but it's probably not as good as the O18 you played (no need to give up that many points).]
;B[ok]C[MM:  Nice timing by Black.];W[oj];B[nk];W[nj];B[lo]
C[MM:  More good timing by Black.  Maybe not aggressive enough -- something like L9, trying to tie together several groups, looks nice.]

If the game had been scored, probably Black would have won by approximately 30.  Black seems to have gained in the last 45-odd moves, even though White successfully invaded the corner.

I think a few things will help you get stronger quickly.  First of all, practice solving life and death problems.  This would have helped especially in the N2-O3 fight.  Professionals and strong amateurs emphasize life and death as the quickest way to improve.  One of several good resources for this is http://www.goproblems.com

Also, make a habit of looking around the board to see if there's something bigger than than the move you have in mind.  I believe you were looking in the wrong direction when you played 46 and 48 (E7 and F8).  You were thinking of the J5 area, but the E11 area was bigger.

Finally, focus on keeping sente.  "Forcing moves first!"

Thanks for the chance to review your game.  I hope my comments help you improve.
