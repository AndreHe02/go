C[Hi! Thanks for submitting this game; it was interesting to review :)

The biggest problem was that you made too many weak groups and didn't defend enough. Taking sente is important, but there's a balance between defence and taking big points. 

The strongest impression I got was that white was in control of the entire game. If you look through, you'll see that your opponent didn't have any weak groups for more than a few moves at a time, so it was impossible for you to ever take the initiative. You certainly got most of the big points, but white still caught up in the end because of his solid play earlier on.

There are quite a few variations, which I hope might be useful to look at, but mainly the points are strategic so keep one eye on the whole board.

If you've got any questions, just ask! I play on KGS as "ods". Best of luck!

;B[nd]
(;W[fp]C[A high approach to a 4-4 stone is unusual. It gives away quite a big corner, although white gets a lot of influence which makes the result almost even.]

(;B[jd]C[Making this exchange now is perfectly good. See the variation for a more complicated alternative.]
;W[qg]LB[qc:A][qe:B][qf:C]C[White is thin while black is strong. You have to be prepared to make use of this later, by invading boldly when the time is right. Otherwise, white has got away with stretching too far.]

(;B[hm]C[This is a powerful move, but w can surround the corner in return. Then white becomes unattackable, and H7 is less useful. Keeping white weak is very important.]

(;B[dn];W[hr];B[qn]C[blas [4k\]: I think that till now I've made no mistake

You need to start thinking about the importance of weak and strong groups. I would say that H2 was a bigger move than D6, because now white has no weak groups at all while black has H5 floating and has just played R6 as well.

White hasn't made many points so he may seem behind, but H2 is a good move that invests in the future. We've only played 20 moves out of 200, and if black has to spend the rest of the game defending, he will surely lose.

It's not bad to have weak groups, as long as your opponent is just as weak as you.]
;W[ro]C[A sharp move. White can fight hard here, because H2 means he has no worries.]

(;B[nq]C[blas [4k\]: This is a good answer attending to the many faces of go's joseki diccionary, but I dont know if with k3 is still a good move

This isn't good. It's a third weak group, while white has none, and so is an overplay.]

(;W[oq]C[This is bad, as it makes black stronger. Moving out directly is better.]

(;B[pm]C[...];W[on]C[...];B[ol]C[...];W[nm]SQ[nn][np][nq]C[...up to here you have let white push right through your position. You should recognise that this is a very big loss. If you could at least cut off white's cutting stone then you might make a fight of it, but in this position your stones around O4 are nothing but a burden.]

(;B[mn]C[This is too heavy. If you think about it, this stone serves no useful purpose and is only dead weight.]
;W[mm];B[ko];W[lq];B[oi]C[Very good - an attack on this group would be very severe.]

(;W[qi]
(;B[cj]LB[og:A]C[blas [4k\]: I hae problems to know when is time to reinforce weak groups or to make territory. I think this is a good move and that my groups are not weak enought to avoid this move

It's a hard decision, but I would play something around A, as a double-purpose move - defending a group and sealing off the centre. This move is big but only has one aim, and there is only so much a single stone can do.

White has yet to play on the top left half of the board, but he is thick everywhere else and has some solid points. I think that if white plays actively and uses black's weaknesses well, white can win from here.]
;W[cf];B[ce]C[Here, this move is excellent. C10 is perfectly placed]
;W[df];B[fd];W[ci];B[di]C[blas [4k\]: This is bad and put me in trouble

This is fine, certainly the best move. White overplays but unfortunately you let him outmanoeuvre you.]

;W[fk];B[lm]C[blas [4k\]: Now is time to reinforce

Yes, but now black looks very thin and it's likely that something will die.

It's also worth looking at the left side. Black left the weak groups to play C10, but white has destroyed the left side anyway. Not only that, but the invasion was sente because black has to come back and defend his weak groups afterwards! The weak groups make it easy for white to do whatever he wants.]
