C[    Hello !
 I'm Tilwen, Black in this game, but I think Gorobei would like to see the review too. I think I'm gonna ask lots of questions, because game was close (at least the end was ^^) so there are probably lots of times where there are interesting questions. I put the questions in the sgf, thanks a lot for all your advices !
 PS: Game was played on KGS, quite long but not too much, at least seriously. I think I won because in the middle game, Gorobei went on byo-yomi.

N: Hello, the most striking in this game is your tendency to leave shapes unfinished. Otherwise this game went on and off, with both players missing some opportunities. 

I left all your comments and questions in. 
My comments are preceded by N:

Regards,
Nelis (Lambic)];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[cf]C[In this moment I feel sick about "one big side openings" (like chinese, kobayashi, san-ren-sei, etc) so I broke up white's nirensei, but I'm not so proud of the result.]
;W[fd];B[cn]
(;W[fq];B[dj]C[It seems ike handicap game.];W[op]LB[hc:A]C[I choose to fight here, because everytime I play this "joseki" it's very nice for me (black here). Would you think it's playable and when I or my opponent had bad idea ?

N: at first: the point A is now a very nice point for black, so you might consider choosing a simple joseki that will give you sente.

second: as long as you don't make big mistakes in direction, a lot of josekis are probable playable on our level. But in this case you make a mistake (see later)]
(;B[pn];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[lp];W[rr]C[I answered solidly to this because I wanted M4 to be my only target of worries.]
(;B[rp]C[N: wrong]
(;W[on];B[pm];W[jp];B[ln];W[om];B[pl];W[ol]C[I was afraid of the consequences of Q10 P9 R11 for instance, white goes on the attack, so I protected M6 first. Was it a good idea ? (or is there a mistake earlier ?)

N: yes earlier. In my view the white double hane is too painfull, so i would extend. the two black stones still have a lot of room, so I don't worry yet.]
(;B[ll]C[N: it might also be a matter of style, this move is very thick]
(;W[ok]C[Now I'm afraid of white Q5 so I tried to peep in sente, but Gorobei made think more complicated than expected.

N: Q5 does not seem dangerous]
(;B[po]C[(I was expecting P5 and then I play Q10)];W[mo]
(;B[oo]C[Maybe I should just have connected and leave this for later.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[mq]C[Here I knew Q10 was very big, but I felt like white M3 or so would give him points and no base for me, so I answered.]
(;B[lq];W[pk];B[qk];W[qj];B[rk]
(;W[mm]C[I think white should have played Q11 simply. We thought a bit about this (see sequences). And now I felt like I need a base, is there more urgent to play ? (because I'll end gote for sure)]
(;B[mp];W[np];B[nq];W[bp]LB[hc:A][pj:B][lm:C]C[The cut at Q10 doesn't work now, but it could later. What do you think of the overall position at this point ?

N: especially the white weakness at A would worry me.

In therms of fixed territory, black right side and white bottom left are about equal. Black has a small weakness at C and white at B. The three black stones on the left side can be handled light so they shouldn't have problems. 
Personally I prefer black]
(;B[bo]LB[en:A]C[This looks bad, I thought it would defend against C8 but I'm not sure it does.

N: strangely i never saw this shape in professional games, in such a position they always play at A. So this move feels very kyu-ish]
;W[cp]C[Anyway white answered it (proper move is C3 right ?).

N: C3 is the safest, but this and C5 are possible too.
Yet I think now a white invasion at c8 is still possible.]
(;B[hc]C[I went on the attack, aiming potentially at Q10.

N: finally, but again you do not add a move locally.];W[be]
C[This seems interesting, I was at a loss for an answer, what would you advise ?]
(;B[bf]C[This seems easy, an the corner is still open I guess.

N: Yes, this is the easiest move. B15 feels a bit strange, so you could also consider going into the corner]
;W[ce]C[D14 seems important, but I wa worried about M7 ...

N: then you should have connected there directly after white peeped]
(;B[lm];W[ml]LB[pi:A]C[Once more he answered my bad move, so I got D14 after all.

N: indeed, bad move by white. I he is worrying for his group, A would be much better.]
;B[df]
(;W[dm]C[Seems like leaning attack, is this a good idea ? Where would you play as white here ?

N: for a leaning attack, you need something to attack, n4 group is too strong now i think.]
;B[cm];W[fc]
(;B[hq]C[I wanted to secure the M5 group, aiming at D6 or so.

N: black has a nice wall, this is the obvious spot to use it
However after the last move of white, you want to make a base. Again you don't finish a shape locally]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[ck];W[ej];B[ei];W[di];B[cj];W[dn]C[I went back on H3 here, thinking D5 still was annoying and E12 wasn't that big, is this right ?

N: D5 doesn't look like a problem. After e12 you can connect easily and probably with sente]
;B[ho]C[It seems like white's K4 can't escape. I felt like I never should have had points here...]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[This was a bit overextended it seems (I mean M17 H17), but questions about this later. I wanted to settle the upper side, giving up the corner.]
(;W[qc]C[This is simple, but for both players, should white have tried O15 ?

N: no];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg];B[md]C[Bad shape for an invasion at K17. I hadn't noticed this. What do you think of the overall position now ?

N: i think black has a slight advantage because he as more potential to make extra points. However several big endgame moves remain and this will be equally important.]
;W[ff]C[N: calm move]
(;B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[ek];B[eh]C[Maybe J16 was bigger here. It gives good yose with G18 F19.

N: more important was that you should have played a different joseki in the upper right. This would have given you sente]
;W[jc]C[And here I just played instincively, basic sequence when there are no surrounding stones : sacrifice a K16 stone to connect underneath. That was silly. But then what is possible here for black ?]
(;B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[ic]
(;B[hd]C[This was a trial, that just didn't work

N: this move feels very dangerous, you ask for it to be cut.]

;W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[ad];W[ae];B[de];W[bd];B[cd]C[Is there a better sequence than this one for me ? I felt like I should have taken the four stones, no matter what.

N: no, does not look like it. You already gained somethingthere. If you wanted more, you shouldn't have played s19.]
