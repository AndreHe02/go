C[Hi Jeff !

My name is David, aka SolarBear on both IGS and KGS. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to e-mail me or contact me on one of those servers.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cq];B[dj];W[jc]C[Wanted to prevent a big U shape

David : Wise move ! For Black to play on this point would be huge. However, since you've already played your two opening moves as low stones (3-4 and 3-3 points, respectively), and your opponent has placed 2 on the 4th line (counting the D10 stone), White is already behind in influence. I think playing at K16 would give a more balanced game. Still, you got the right idea.]
;B[op];W[ec];B[ee];W[gd];B[mc];W[nq]LB[np:A][oq:B]TR[lp][mp]
[lq][mq]C[David : This move does not seem to be joseki.

Now, does that mean this move is bad ? No, but you have to realize that, by playing the shoulder hit, Black will very probably extend to A or B to defend his stone. What this means is that White is actually *strengthening* Black's stone, which is obviously bad. The O3 stone will also lose a liberty.

Any of the triangled points would've made a fine pincer.];B[oq]
C[Now, White's stones are split, and the O3 one is in very bad shape.]
;W[np]C[Here, White is "pushing up the cart from behind, which is rarely a good thing. By pushing, White also hurts the R4 corner stone.

Have a look at this nice wiki page : http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushingFromBehind]
;B[on];W[po]LB[rm:c][qn:b][pq:a]C[If I had this to do over, I would look at A, B, or C. I don't know why I was thought this was a good idea.

David : You're absolutely right. Here, White is helping Black make shape.]
;B[oo]C[White is left with two very weak groups. Remember : NEVER have more than one weak group at the same time.]

(;W[qn]LB[qn:A][pq:B]C[David : See variation.];B[qm];W[ql]C[David : I don't see what this brings to White. The focus, right now, should the weakedned R4 stones.]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[pl]
(;W[gq]LB[gq:A][qr:B]C[Realized the value of the plays had diminished

David : The R4 stones are awfully weak, right now. See variation.]
(;B[qk]LB[qk:A][kp:B]C[David : Black was soft on White. See variation.]
;W[pj]C[Again, playing contact near a strong Black position will only bring trouble.]
;B[pg];W[lb];B[mb];W[qh];B[qg];W[cl]C[Good move, threatening to slide under the D10 stone.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[qr]C[I decided at this point that black had taken the corner, which spooked me a little bit. In hindsight leaving the 3-3 exposed was a huge mistake of mine but somehow at the time I thought it would only be a small reduction and I was better off making big gains elsewhere

David : Dead ? Not quite. See variations starting from this point. I have to agree, though, that's it's not entirely obvious.]
(;W[cc]LB[cb:C][cc:A][rr:B]C[Wrong move. See next move.];B[dd]
C[Black extends...];W[dc]C[David : ...and White needs to connect because Black extended. White made some territory for sure, but ended in gote..

See variation of move 38.];B[rr];W[qc];B[pc]
(;W[qd]LB[pb:B][qd:A]C[David : Wrong move. See variation.];B[re]
C[David : I can't find a variation where White wins lives after B45.]
;W[qe];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[sc];W[oc];B[od];W[pe]C[David : Dead stones are dead. By trying desperate moves such as this, White is helping Black solidify his position.]
;B[oe];W[ek];B[ej];W[bj]C[David : Good sequence ! This keeps Black's territory in check and makes it harder to invade the lower left.]
;B[ch]
(;W[ff]LB[ff:A][kp:B]C[David : Premature. See variation.];B[fj]
;W[fk];B[ep]C[David : Very, very risky. Black has less risky plays available, such as attacking the O3 group which is just begging to be attacked.]
;W[fo]C[David : Defending with the keima is too thin. Black's attack is a bluff, but White's position isn't too strong either.]

;B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[bq];B[bn];W[bm]C[This saved my 7 white stones by making black dead with fewer liberties]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[gs];W[fq];B[fr];W[ds]C[I expected black to give me the 2 stones and try to escape toward the side]
;B[dr]C[when black played this instead I knew right away the whole thing was dead]
;W[es];B[fp];W[gp];B[hq];W[hs];B[ir];W[fs]C[David : Great sequence !]
;B[iq];W[kq]C[David : Excellent attack ! B99 was a very slow move, and White took full advantage of this.]
;B[io];W[jn]C[David : Be wary of using knight's moves to chase around, or you could get cut yourself. See variation on next move.]
(;B[ko]LB[jo:B][ko:A];W[jo]C[I read in a Janice Kim book not to play pre-peeped positions. When I saw black do this I thought I should exploit it. I didn't understand at the time just how disruptive this would prove to be for black

David : Absolutely. Excellent reflex  !];B[no];W[mo];B[mn];W[lo]

(;W[os]LB[bf:B][ki:C][os:A]C[David : Q2 was a small, endgame move. Use it to play elsewhere. See variation for ideas.]
;B[ps];W[nr];B[mp];W[lp];B[mq];W[mr];B[lc]
(;W[qj]LB[nj:B][qj:A]C[David : Slow move. Black is very, very strong around here. Instead of trying to live on the side, I'd suggest trying to reduce Black's moyo (see second variation of W112) or jumping : see variation.]
;B[lk];W[nh];B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[of];B[pf];W[ne];B[nc];W[me]
;B[kd];W[pi]LB[ke:a]C[I see now this was a mistake of mine. I should have seen how much trouble my 5 white stones just NW of these were in and instead looked at a play like A

David : A move around "a" would've been good for defending.

At the time I was very focused on trying to win the side which would have been nice but I think I should have gone after empty space before fighting over it regardless]
;B[oj];W[og]C[David : Slow move. Here's an interesting link on light play : http://senseis.xmp.net/?Light

The point is that, in this kind of situation, you need to live or flee : be ready to sacrifice some stones if that allows you to live.]
;B[pk];W[rh];B[rj];W[rg]C[I think it ws about here I realized I was losing the fight for the side, but I could try and use black's shortage of liberties to enclose the corner as a consolation prize]

;B[be];W[ad];B[ae];W[bc];B[di];W[cj];B[ef];W[in]C[I was thinking of the black stone this touches was dead, but I thought the risk black could bring it back to life (and how big that would be!) was probably worth more than any options elsewhere. I don't know the word for it but making this move instead of trying to play big elsewhere was based on kind of a risk/benefit appraisal on my part since black had spooked me with his ability to take the SE corner early on

David : And some people will tell me that psychology has no role in go ! Hah ! :-)]
;B[ij];W[ik];B[hj]C[I was very happy the black was letting my thicken this up since I felt like the 3 white stones above gave me a much better deal. Plus it eased my fears black would somehow invade and I'd be forced to yield area to keep the lower 5 black stones dead

David : You're absolutely right : these 3 stones up top could easily destroy that territory, while White's as good as secure. Black is really helping White win this game.]
;W[hk]
(;B[fg]
(;W[rb]C[With this move I told black I wasn't 100% sure I needed it but was unwilling to take the risk because I could see how close it was going to be. Black replied that he thought I needed that and perhaps more and he read white's stones as dead

David : Let's see... (go back to B181 variation).];B[sb];W[pa]
;B[gf]C[When black made this move he commented that I could keep the corner "for now." I'm not sure if he was hoping I'd waste a move securing a live shape or thought it was immutably dead and he wanted sente elsewhere. I read the corner as mine/white's, though I kept thinking about the corner as we played elsewhere and eventually decided I needed to come back to it first]
;W[hf];B[hg]LB[fd:d][fe:a][ge:c][ff:b][ig:e]C[I think black expected me to play at A to save stone at B, then place both in atari by responding at C, forcing me to respond black at D

I decided a play at E would be much more favorable reduction even if I lost B

David : Excellent choice. Playing at "a" is, what, 1 point in gote ? A move's worth is not measured only in the points it brings you, but also how many it will allow you to make.]
;W[ig];B[fe];W[ge];B[ji];W[hh];B[gg];W[ih]C[David : Good !]
;B[gh];W[ll];B[ml];W[lm];B[mm];W[kk];B[kj];W[rc]C[By this point I decided that white could only keep the corner with 2 outside liberties. I forced the exchange because I feared black would take one of the outside liberties, and the corner with it, which especially by this point was immensely bigger than any other play on the board]
;B[sa];W[qa];B[sb];W[sa];B[ra];W[sc]C[David : Wise choice. It does make White lose a point, but ko fights have a tendency to degenerate, and since White is leading the game... there's no point in looking for trouble.]
;B[ri]C[When black played this, I wondered at what point he had known what the eventual outcome of the corner would be.

David : Black probably bet on the off chance that White would connect at T13...]

C[When black made this I wondered if I should kick myself for not spending more time thinking about this corner

David : You should definitely not kick yourself. However, taking some more time to read out the situation would've given you a good result !]
;W[ed]C[I was hoping to cut with a double atari after this]
;B[ce]C[which unfortunately was obvious enough for black to see :)]
;W[ho]C[David : -1 point.];B[hi]C[David : All in all, a good game.

Some final, general advice :

1) Do tsumego ! (I always finish a review with this advice first.)

2) Avoid contact plays in the opening (see W12) in most situations. Learning a few joseki and the meaning of their moves could help you learn when and how to use them.

3) Never, ever leave two weak groups on the board. Black made a lot of profit from your R4 stones.

4) Be ready to lose some stones and avoid slow moves to save some (see W120). It would have been much more profitable for you to leave them where they were and reduce Black's moyo on the right.

5) Oh, and tsumego. :-)

If you have some more question, don't hesitate to contact me. Goodbye and good go !]
