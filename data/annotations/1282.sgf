;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[Playing the Chinese opening against a 3-stone stronger player is a bit ambitious and should provide a good chance to learn.  But one must be prepared to fight and play strategically.  Let's see what happens.]
;W[kq];B[jd];W[qf];B[re]C[While I am no expert on the Chinese opening, nor on all josekis, this move is very suspect.  It does not take the corner, does not connect up with the lower stones, and the black stone on Q9 is too far away to really mount a severe attack on the white stone by undercutting the base - which you can't really do.  I like the solid play of R16 or the one-point jump to O16 better.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[rd]C[I think the connection is big, and important, but one could consider leaving it - you don't really know whether it would be better to play from the right side or on top or what yet.]
;W[qi]C[White is now settled and black should look elsewhere on the board for a big point.  I'm personally partial to D10 or C10.  D plays better with the top.  The approach/extension from the black formation at the top - say around F17 - is good - building the framework, making sense of the strength in the top right, and prompting a white response - with there still being plenty of room to invade and settle in the white framework on the left.

If you must play on the right, the steel post at R9 looks better as does the attach at Q11.]
;B[rj]C[Oops.  See prior comments.  Notice how this was gote above?  you can bet the same will be true here.  Since white is already settled here - or nearly so - white can, but should not ignore this.  White should answer once or twice and then leave it.]
;W[nc]C[This is too ambitious for white, I think.  It invites black to separate the two white groups while attacking.  Something around P15 or even P14 looks good.  the attach on top of 16 would just make this white stone stronger.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pe];W[qb]C[Now what has black to show for those careful, territory building moves in the top right corner?  White is strong on both sides and b has no territory.  Black should now play for influence - N15 followed by an attack on the then weakened right group, for instance.  Black must get something in exchange for the upper corner- and power and an attack would likely be sufficient.]
;B[rb];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[rc]C[These moves are gote and do not guarantee only one eye in gote.  One must attack here and play out, not in.]
;W[og]C[game over.  white is now alive if white wishes and black has a running group which can be chased all across the board - plus the upper black stone and the two black right side stones can become targets later on.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[kf]C[I think 31 wants to push again - if White continues, white bumps its head onto the black stone.  or Black could turn to N13 perhaps.]
;W[le];B[mg]C[Guess which connection is now to be severed - that move 31 which seemed so solid turns out to be in altogether the wrong place.]
;W[lf];B[ng];W[lg];B[oi]C[Black has now given up the upper side in exchange for an attack from on a strong white group.   37 is the right move to attack.  If I were white, I would leave the group as is for now and play elsewhere to look to come back to resuscitate it later.  Trying to live inside will just give black outside strength which will counter balance all white did in building that wall.

Both sides seem to be playing inconsistently and with a very localized view of things.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[ri];B[rk];W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh]C[From here white should be able to read it out - and to look to try to get out by cutting - or just leave it for ko threats or for later developments.  If white is going to try to live inside and cannot read it out, then whit should look not for a key point, but to expand the eyespace with a move at Q14 or Q11 or some such.  Q11 creates possibilities with the two stones on the 11th line.]
;W[rg];B[pi];W[ph];B[pf];W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[mj];W[ol];B[pm]
;W[qo];B[qn]C[57 can't be right, can it.  it lets white attack the black corner and stengthen the two cutting stones all at once.  much better would be  the bamboo joint, attach to the left, or p6.]
;W[po];B[om];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[pg]C[is this necessary? If w plays there what happens with b  at R12?]
;W[nr];B[qr];W[rq];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[qq];B[rr];W[os];B[sr]
;W[pr];B[sp];W[pp];B[sq]C[Let's step back now.  Would you rather be w or b?  B has a few points on the right.  say about 45.  White has about 15 certain points.  But the board everywhere by the right side is dominated by white right now.

Also, just looking at the board at a glance it seems unbalanced - some of those plays should have been elsewhere.  Both sides overplayed or played-out the right side too soon.]
;W[kg];B[if];W[gc];B[kc];W[ib]C[White should protect here - M18 if low, otherwise run out with the group.]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[nb];W[ob];B[lc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ke];B[je];W[jf]
;B[he];W[ig]C[White has allowed black to settle too easily here.  Black did a good job of taking advantage of white's error on 82 to settle by attacking the white group.]
;B[hg];W[id];B[ie];W[hd]C[96 and 98 are too soon - white gains nothing - black gets even stronger.]
;B[ge]C[99 seems small to me - a play by b at w100 seems larger - or an high approach on the upper left side.  Something larger scale is needed here.

BTW, count the board again - white has caught up almost completely already by taking the upper side - with good prospects for getting the upper left corner too.]
;W[hh];B[gg]C[W 100 makes black strong and leaves a cutting point behind.  101 is the right response.]
;W[ii];B[fc]C[103 is the wrong direction entirely, I think.This is a reducing move, not really an attacking move.  White has no choice but to cut and B is likely to give up an even larger area to white than necessary - b at 104 is simple, strong and patient and sets up for a stronger attack on the left and even them bottom.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fb];B[hc];W[ec];B[ic];W[hb]C[So what?  how many points did black lose here - white gave up tow stones on the top in order to take the whole, very big corner and w now has great strength there on the 4th line instead of the third.  This is bad for black.

W110 is too small given the size of moves on the left side and bottom - those two stones are worth at most 10 points - surely it is obvious there are moves larger than 10 points on the board.]
;B[cn]C[As black sees - and moves right in.  The choice here is tough.  I like the higher approach of D6 - to play better with what is going on elsewhere.  But it may be a matter of taste.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[cl];W[bn];B[cm];W[em];B[el]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[bm];W[bo]C[Black's choice of joseki here seems quite wrong - giving white another huge corner with a black formation facing white strength on top and left - so no likely to get a lot of points here.]
;B[mn]C[127 is hard to evaluate.  Probably the capping move or shoulder hit at K4 is better - necessary even.  And the two white stones can still cause trouble here inside the black formation.
Playing around D14 looks best to me - then making the desperate invasion on the lower side to try to reduce white enough to make a game of it.]
;W[cj]C[128 - white gives a gift here - plays too close to black strength.  Much simpler for white would be C14 - takes the corner and reduces black's space - especially since white can still encroach from the top.  this is the right area of the board, but the wrong placement.]
;B[di]C[Tough to find the right response for black here.  But I like the cap or one line to the right - not quite so tight.]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[gl];W[hm];B[jh]C[And here is why - w gets life on the side and black gets what?  An attack on the white group - but W has lots of resources here, it seems.  You will note, however, how the move so long ago which gave you the bamboo joint (the white move at h12) followed by the terrible move at J11 causes white trouble now.  W at k12 would have been much better - or a simple connection at j12 would have been better.]
;W[jg];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[ih]C[W has one eye -  can b keep w in without getting another eye?  Looks doubtful.]
;B[kj]C[43 gives up the white group.  Ifyou were going to do this, then K12 was wrong.  Just squeeze the group from the outside  - now you are making w run through space where yhou could have taken some points and not getting much in return.]

;W[ce];B[de];W[ed];B[qa];W[lo]C[Isn't 68 - and that whole side of the board much bigger than anything else?  167 should have been around k4.]
;B[hl];W[il];B[in]C[Ouch!  Proverb - don't peep at a cutting point.  Cut and fight.  Your only chance.]
;W[im];B[kn];W[ln];B[jm];W[kl];B[ko];W[lm]C[The fight is complicated and is more than I can comment on - too many options at each move from here out.

I hope the comments on the opening strategy and the strategic choices and direction of play are helpful.   Play larger.  See the strategic, full board impact of local situations.]
