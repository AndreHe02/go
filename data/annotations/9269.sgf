tatata [3k\]: hh];B[pc]C[Hello ! Please help me to review this game with a few questions that I have .Thank you very much .]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qe];W[ec]TR[pc][qe]C[The low approach here is not the best idea for white because it allows black to make a very nice pincer that works well with his enclosure on the top right.]

(;B[gd]LB[pa:5][pb:4][pc:3][pd:2][pe:1]C[This pincer has the right idea, but the wrong execution.

On the top right, the enclosure can be viewed as a wall of 5 high. There is a saying that says "extend from walls by the length of the wall +1"
In this case that would be a 6 space extention from the top right corner.

See variation.]
(;W[ee];B[df];W[gb]LB[gb:B][ee:A]C[Understanding the joseki that you are playing is very important.

White does not understand the joseki that he is playing because he first jumps out with A and then goes back with B.
Move A indicates that white wants to run away into the center. But move B directly contradicts that by running back towards the side.]

(;B[hc]LB[hc:B][df:A]TR[gb]C[Can you tell me how to response with this Joseki ?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Black does not understand the joseki he is playing either and failed to punish white for his mistake of moving back to the side with the marked stone.

Move A indicates that black wants to surround white and prevent him from running into the center. But move B leaves the path to the center open and tries to stop white from going to the side.

A better move: see variation.];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[de];W[dd]

;W[hq]
(;B[ck]C[This is too passive! This is almost the same as passing.]
;W[rp];B[qk]LB[hq:B][lq:A]C[The move on R9 is too passive to attack with white shape ? Can I use K3 to attack white which is better ?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

R9 is fine. It defends your R6 stone.
You gave up K3 by playing elsewhere several times.

Black ignored A and B. This puts the black K3 stone at a 2 vs 1 disadvantage. Fighting there would be unwise. Treat this stone as aji now.
Previously, I pointed out that black should have jumped into the center as a response to white A. It is too late to do so now.]

C[Black has pushed at white's shape and gained nothing. White was able to reduce the aji in his shape.
A general rule is that if a move does not give you a direct advantage, don't play it until it does!]

This is the end of the review.
The way I like to review is not to review the fights / captures of groups that are the result of a mistake that was made, but to address the mistakes that were made leading to this result. The situation on the board right now should have never happened.

I hope this review was useful for you.];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[li]
