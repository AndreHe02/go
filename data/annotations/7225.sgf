C[Dear reviewer, this game I recently played Many Faces of Go v11, at maximum difficulty level.

Previously I was told that i'm playing to passively, and only respond to opponent's moves, instead of attacking him.

In this game I tried to play more aggressively, and won by about 40 points.

But all the game I had the feeling that my territori was full of holes, and i won not because of my own strength, but because of opponent's weaknes.

I would be glad if you could comment my moves, and show what would be better, if the moves were too reckless.

My comments will be marked as D:

I will mark mine with an S:];B[pd]C[S: Hello Pavel, I am Stephan and I'll try to do my best to comment your game. If you have any further questoin don't hesitate to come back to me.]
;W[dp];B[pq]C[D: I placed stone here because of the white stone at hoshi point]
;W[dc];B[de]C[D: Trying to be aggressive, and knowing that to enclose corner and to prevent enemy from doing that is  almost same valuable, I attacked upper left corner]
;W[dh];B[ef]LB[ec:3][dd:2][fd:4][gd:5][hd:7][fe:1][ge:6]TR[dh]
[fh][dk]C[D: If I played my usual style I'd answer at A, but I wanted to put pressure on the marked stone

S: Personaly, I tend to always answer through one joseki. There are so many that if I could only rememebr those that are listed, I'd be very glad and probably much smarter than I am!!

If you look at this page (http://senseis.xmp.net/?34PointHighApproachTwoSpaceHighPincer)
you will find that your move is not even listed but they are many other variation proposed.

Furthermore, I don't think you put any pressure on the marked stone. The stone will easily go out on the two triangle marks whenever it wanted to do so.

I think that the ideas of joseki on the begining of the games (and I am not pretending I understand it) is either to create a solid base of life or start to build a strong influence on the outside. I think your play achieve none of the above objectives.. It is even quite weak because White could try to push you strongly if he wanted to]

(;W[dl];B[fc]LB[ed:A]TR[dh]C[D: Here I proceeded with an aggresive style, trying to build a thickness facing my nirensei on the right.

I have feeling that my stones have weakness at A... What would you say?

S: No I don't think that A is a weakness. White can break the wall but doing so, it will be so weak that it may be killed by black afterwards.
Because White chose to play the Triangle Stone before which didn't put any preassure on black, then you have the choice: either build thickness as you did or invade the corner.]

(;W[hc];B[ge]LB[dc:1][hc:2][dh:3]TR[fc][de][ef]C[D: How about this responce to enemy's move? The marked shape doesn't look that strong

S: I think the shape is quite strong, the question is more about what did you want to achieve? What has Black achieved?

Had he killed the stone 1 ? Probably not. Another move is required
Had he killed the stone 2 ? Of course not, this stone will easily escape
Had he killed the stone 3 ? No
Had he build a strong influnce on the center of the board. Not yet, because of stones 2 and 3]

(;W[po];B[pk]LB[pl:A]TR[qf][qg][qh]C[D: Here I chose pincer, since I had stone at Q16

S: Again it is not joseki. Usually, if you want to play here, the usual joseki is on A.

Here the issue is that you don't attack the white stone, nor do you use Q16 efficiently. White will be able to play something around the triangle because it can accept to tenuly on the bottomo]
;W[oq];B[or];W[op]LB[nq:1][nr:2]C[S: The normal continuation is 1 or 2. The purpose is to attack the wWhite stone.

Once Black had played this, White will have to answer]
(;B[qq]LB[nq:2][nr:1]TR[pq][or]C[D: Is this correct way of building of living shape?

S: In fgact, if you look at Sensei again (http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=34PointHighApproachTwoSpaceHighPincer&page=34PointHighApproachTwoSpaceHighPincerOutsideAttachment)
suggestion there is to play at 1 or 2. instead of your circle stone which is probably too submissive. With 1 and 2 Black will live and give White a hard time!!
Here Black live of course, but Black stones were almost alive already]
;W[kc];B[mc]C[D: Here I limited white from further extension

S: That is quite good. White is in a bad position and needs to answer]
;W[nr];B[ps];W[mp];B[fq]TR[hq]C[D: Trting to prevent white from commandeering the bottom side I attacked the bottom left corner

S: If I would have been White I would have replied with H3. But yes, it was a good idea to put a foot in the bottom]
;W[cc]C[D: Strange move... Sometimes Manfy Faces does weird things

S: Yes];B[id]TR[hc][kc]C[D: Since white didn't answer my move in the bottom. I tried to find a move, which would strenghten me, and which would make white answer. So I chose this move, since it threatens to cut whites marked stones, and increases my presence in the upper left]
;W[eb]C[D: White preferred to strengthen the corner]
(;B[ic]TR[fb][gb]C[D: so I cut through the hole, having following sequence in mind (see variation)

S: I think it is good, yes White is almost killed. If Black wanted to be more agressive, he may claim at playing F18 or G18 though but you may argue that J17 is more secure]

(;W[qm]C[S: ?? I am not sure I understand this move];B[rl]LB[ql:A]
C[D: Usually I'd answer at A... But, thinking about sente, I made this move

S: OK];W[fh];B[gg]TR[qg][hq]SQ[pk][rl][fq]C[I think that the two mak places are very urgent moves because if White played around those mark then the Black marked stones may be in a difficult situation. I think that instead playing your move I would have secured one of those two groups of stones.]
;W[qi];B[qh]TR[qi]C[D: Is this good attack on the marked stone?

S: I don't know, usually you tend to avoid unless specifric reason to play touching the other stones because doing so, you will strengthen your opponent giving him the occasion to build a wall. Nut on the other hand it gives you to build a wall that will create a big terrotory in the corner so it looks good as well]

(;W[pi]TR[ph]C[S: White answer is to slow. In this position, I think that Q12 is always better]
;B[ph];W[oh]
(;B[oi]C[D: First I was thinking about other moves (see variants), but I considered that they would be to passive

S: Yes it is a good move, you build a very strong position]
;W[oj];B[ni]TR[pk][rl]C[D: Seems like I've dumped my marked stones

S: Yes it was the cost to get the territory in the corner so the sacrifice was probably worth of the gain]
;W[pj]
(;B[ke]CR[nj]TR[hc][kc][iq][dr]C[D: since white did not try to save his marked stones, I wanted to ensure that they were completely dead, and would not bother me in the future

S: I think it was much too early compare to the other possible moves and White will have a very hard time to live. He may be able to save H17  but that's all.

Another intersting move would perhaps had been O10];W[nj]
(;B[mi]TR[hg][ih][jh][kh][li]C[D: That was a passive move, but it increased the strength of the marked group, and was an "investment" into the border of my territory

S: That's a shame you let White played on S10. I think that now N12 was mandatory. If you hadn't played it, it would have been very expensive. So it was not passive at all]
;W[fb]
(;B[gc];W[ro]
(;B[rp]C[D: Was this move too small? Or it was really necessary to protect my group in the bottom right?

S: It looks like if you tenuki, your group is dead];W[nl]
(;B[dr]C[D: I proceeded with my aggresive tactic. (first i had other idea in mind, see variation)

S: At least !!!!!!!!!!!];W[cq];B[iq]C[D: was this move right?

S: Yes it is joseki, and you need to quiclky create a base for life because White is surrounding you everywhere so Black is still very weak]
;W[kq];B[fo]C[D: By this move I wanted to limit potential of his moyo on the left

S: What is important there is to live and fortunately your move is good for this as well, but it is even more important than the ambition to limit his moyo]
;W[cr];B[kp]TR[dl][io]C[D: This contact play wasn't great idea I guess, but since white had strength in that area, strengthening him a little bit more wouldn't be big problem

S: It is quite little, playing in the center is more important at this stage, or attack the White marked stone]
;W[lq]
(;B[jp]C[D: Here chose to play solid

S/ OK];W[dn]TR[lm][ln]
(;B[gm];W[gh];B[hg];W[lk]
(;B[ri]C[D: this move was gote];W[rj];B[rh];W[ng]
(;B[og]TR[mi][ni][oi]C[S: I wouldn't  have taking care of this move and would have strengthen the three black stones]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[qf];B[nh]TR[pe][qf][ng]C[D: Preffered to play kill the stone, to reduce the chances of the marked stone for salvation

S: correct];W[mg];B[kh]C[D: Making thist move I had in mind preventing invaded stones from having two eyes

S: or more probably escaping in the center. It is correct];W[hn]
TR[ln]C[D: Another invader...

S: yes, reason why M6 was important];B[jm]C[D: Here I tried to soround him]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[jr]
(;B[ek]SQ[fk][gk][hk][ik][fl][gl][il][fm][im][fn][gn][in][go]
[ho][io]C[D: I preferred not to respond to last whites move, instead of that I tried to attack white, and gain some strength in the marked region, to reduce chances of intruded white stones for living

S: OK, I think you were right, but if I had been Black, I would have secured G8]

(;W[dj]TR[dk]C[S/ I think it is a mistake for White, it should have played in D9 instead]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[em]C[D: Proably that was to loose];W[el];B[fl]
C[D: And this move too wasn't solid enough];W[fk];B[gk]TR[dm]
C[S/ D7 is probably better for White];W[fj];B[dm]C[D: Here I wanted to force white to kill my two marked stones

S: Good];W[cl]C[D: White refused to kill them...];B[cm]C[D: but nevertheless I invaded into whites territory

S/ White playing so badly deserved it];W[gn];B[fn];W[cn];B[bm]
C[D: I continued pushing into whites territory

S: Correct];W[hh];B[mk]C[D: Once again I ignored whites last move, and placed my stones into whites weakpoint]

(;W[nk];B[ml]TR[mk]C[D: I preferred not to connect with the group above, but to push down, increaing liberties of the marked group

S: Ok it works]
(;W[bl]
(;B[ji]C[D: here I decided to connect my groups, and separate enemy's ones

S: that is a good move, not because it separates enemy's group but because it prevents White to invade your moyo]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[kj];B[li];W[mm]C[D: That was "thank-you-move" from white]
;B[ll];W[bn];B[mn]TR[lm]C[D: I made this move intuitively... Probably at A would be better

S/ No it doesn't work, White should have answered on M7]
(;W[nn];B[lm];W[nm];B[bf]LB[ln:A]C[D: I decided not to defend cutting point at A, instead of that I reduced whites area in upper left

S: Yes it is bigger];W[bh];B[bd];W[bc];B[so]C[D: Was this to small?]
;W[sn];B[sp];W[rn];B[jk]TR[gb][ih][hj][ir]C[D: At this point, I thought that I was leading on territory, so I could relax and play defensively

S/ That is not a defensive move, it is a move inside your territory!!! All those moves are defensive moves]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[ne]TR[nc];B[of]TR[mc][nc][pd][qd]C[S: Wrong side, With O17 you protect the corner and White has no place to create two eyes. I think that with aplyer stronger than I am, something would be achievable for White in the corner.

This shape gives a lot of space for invasion and is much weaker compare to a shape with the stone in O17 instead of N17]
