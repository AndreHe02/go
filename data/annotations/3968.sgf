C[Hi! I'm wjzz and i've played as black in this game. I lost by more than 10 points. A tried to analyse this game, but i'd be grateful if you pointed out my mistakes and bad ideas. Thx in advance!

(;B[mc]TR[de][df][cf]C[I played this to prevent white from making a moyo at the top but the sequence went bad.

R: The sequence on the left makes building a moyo difficult for white...nonetheless, this is a fine move.  You might also want to consider the two-space high pincer in this position...makes nice relationship with the marked stones on the left.]
;W[pf]C[This seems to be quite agresiv, what should i do?

R: Yes, this is very aggressive.  With the two space high, you would have to cut.  With the low, you might be okay to connect.]

(;B[pe]C[R: This is fine];W[oe]
(;B[qf]MA[pf]C[R: This is not, I think.  When white made the move at Q14, then Black Q15, black must cut now.]
;W[pd];B[qe];W[kc];B[ob];W[pb]C[bad change for me i think. i gained nothing and white got into the corner

;B[pi];W[oi]TR[mg][mf][me][mc][ob][nb]C[hmm. i crowled on the forth line. i know its good but i was afraid that the marked group was getting weaker with each "step". And white has build a moyo at the top anyway :-)

R: Don't worry about white's moyo.  Do worry about your marked group.  Good timing when to stop crawling...though a hane at Q10 might hurt.]
;B[li];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]
(;B[hc]C[im not sure about this one, but i when i dont know what to pay i always invade ;-)

R: I like that attitude. ^^  I think J17 might be a little better, since you can connect underneath at L17 if you have to.]
;W[ge];B[jd];W[je]
(;B[kd];W[id];B[jc];W[ic];B[jb];W[ib]C[is this only me or i have gained a bit too much?

R: Black did fine, but could have done even better I think.  Black did settle his weak group in sente though, which is very good.  nicely done.]
;B[lq]C[R: sure, when you don't know what else to do, invade.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[nm];B[pl];W[cl];B[hp]C[R: this probably isn't the best move, but it's playable.]
;W[jn]
(;B[jr]C[R: I think M7 is better here];W[iq]C[R: now H4 looks like a bad move, so either K2 is questionable, or H4 was.  I'd vote both.]

(;B[bk]LB[bi:A]C[Im scared of moves like A. i made a varation but i dont know if its ok.

R: after C8, white can slider under and gouge out your base.  evnetually, you want to defend, as you do here.  S2 isn't that big right now...good choice.]

[fa][ea][da][ca][ba][aa]C[i think it was a good game, i enjoyed it, but i dont know why i lost. in my opinion yose was ok, maybe E6 helped white too much?

Thank for your help again.

R:  yes, the game was close, and E6 at D6 might have won you the game.  Also, taking profit in the bottom right corner earlier before white played Q2 would have made the difference.  Your general play is good.  Work on maybe learning best invasion points, instead of just guessing when you don't know what else to do.]
