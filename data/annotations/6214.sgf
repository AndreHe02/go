C[This should be a quick review because I am making a simple request of an analysis of my opening. I dont know what Im usuing but when I open like this or variants of this, its very effective.

My 4-4 then 3-4 opening

Ps: I joined the reviewing community but please dont think Im doing this just to get my games reviewed. I have some free time as a college student and this is much more fun than anything else.

Welcome to the Go Teaching Ladder! It is fun to review games. Lately, I probably review more than I play, which is probably bad.

Regarding your question. The opening that you are playing is called the Chinese Opening and is a well recognized line of play. In this game, both sides play this position. Often one side plays both stones on the 4-4 points while the other side plays the Chinese Opening. I think that you get a good lead in the opening. Both sides play the first several moves well, but then you start to show an instinct for playing the bigger moves. W plays narrower moves, too close to his already strong positions. I don't make too many comments because you do well and only have the one question.

There is nothing wrong with sending any games that you have a question about, but I find that a certain kind of game makes for a review that really helps your play. That is a game where you feel that you played at your best, but still lost. If you send a game like that for review, you will really learn something about Go!]

Both sides play reasonably well to this point.];W[nc]LB[jd:A]
C[Ichimonji [14k\]: :D

This move is OK locally and is good for aiming at an extension down the right side. B sees that comming and also gets the big point at A.]
;B[pl];W[ph];B[jd];W[en];B[gn];W[ep]LB[ch:A][ci:B]C[
W falls behind by generally playing smaller moves like these, while B, at least sometimes makes a bigger play. Both the W and B groups here are strong, so this corner is of little interest right now.  The W and B groups in the lower right are weaker. Either side could gain by attacking the other and/or strengthening his own groups. Around A or B is a big move for either side. B's upper left is big, but loose. Maybe it could be invaded.]

C[
B is ahead. W has lots of stones invested in the lower left, but his territory there is very narrow.]
