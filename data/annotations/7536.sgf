inimino: I have made my comments throughout, marked like this one.  Hopefully they will be helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions.

(;B[pf]C[inimino: I wonder about this move, if it is really the best.

It seems to me that this is a little too close to Q10, and that playing here is not really that interesting.  Instead I would consider Q17.  This forces w to do something about the O17 stone, as Q17 creates a very strong shape.  W could then play R14 but this seems to give a bad result; more likely w will play around L16, after which b can add a stone and have a very nice shape on the top corner and side while the w stones look a little haphazard.  See var.]
;W[pb]
(;B[lc]C[inimino: I wonder if starting a fight here is really the best idea.  A different idea would be to let w end in gote here and take a large point on the bottom side, which is very favorable place for b to play.  See var.]
;W[md];B[jd]C[inimino: Instead of this I would push M16 first, then probably extend to J17 soon.  There is no harm in pushing the w group out into the center, and strengthen your weak group at the same time.  W gains nothing from running out, since b is well placed on the right side.]
;W[jb];B[jc];W[ib];B[ld]C[inimino: This makes the K17, J18 exchange look bad.  If you are going to play M16, better to play it directly and leave the possibility of J18, etc, for later.]
;W[mf];B[nb];W[ob];B[mb];W[oc];B[qc];W[ph]C[inimino: This is an odd move, w creates a new weak group at a bad time.  B should get a good result with careful play.]
;B[og];W[oi];B[nh];W[oj]
(;B[pk]C[inimino: Horrible move.

The w group at top right side is very weak and must be attacked.  The b group at O12 is not quite fully settled at the moment.  Anything that ignores this situation, such as this move, is a terrible mistake.  See the variations for some acceptable alternatives.]
;W[lg];B[kb]LB[jd:1][mf:2][og:3][ph:4][pj:5]C[inimino: Unfortunately this is another poor move.  B wants to settle his group, but seems to miss the larger picture of what is going on.  There are 5 groups of alternating color in a small area (numbered).  This is an unstable situatione  It is very likely that some of these will end up connected, and some may end up with severe difficulties making eyes and have to make life in gote, etc.  What happens to these groups could very easily determine the game outcome.

This move at L18 helps one group of b, but does not help any other group or make any connection, and does not put any pressure on any w group.  Better would be something like N11 or K14, i.e. something that affects more than one group on the board at this critical time.]
;W[mi]C[inimino: W plays the move that b ought to have.];B[mh]
;W[lh];B[li];W[mj];B[ki]C[inimino: Now in order to keep the w groups separated, b himself has been cut.  Now the life of the b corner is not as certain, and b has a floating group of two stones at the center to worry about.  All this is the result of the move L18 which could have avoided these issues.]
;W[jg];B[nl];W[lk];B[jj];W[qb];B[qh]C[inimino: This looks like a strange idea, S18 first seems more natural.  However, I wish to emphasize again that all this could be avoided had L18 not been played at such an unfortunate moment.]
;W[pg];B[qg]C[inimino: O14 might be a better option, but the variation seems quite complicated.  This however seems an admission of defeat.]
;W[of]C[inimino: From here, w has no trouble.  With losing these cutting stones, b has a very difficult game.  This unfortunate result for b mainly arises from L18, so again this demonstrates that L18 was not the right move.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[oe];W[nf];B[bd];W[db];B[cb]C[inimino: C15 may be slightly better here.]
;W[be]
(;B[ac]C[inimino: This is more or less dead, but see var.];W[bb]
;B[ba];W[ab];B[ce];W[bf];B[gd];W[hc];B[de];W[cd];B[dg];W[dh]
;B[ch];W[bh]
(;B[eh]C[inimino: Strange idea... see var.];W[ci];B[di];W[ch]

(;B[ef]C[inimino: Again, the center is more important than these two D15 stones, which are too expensive to save.]
;W[dj];B[ck];W[ei]C[inimino: At this point, in my opinion, the game is over.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[ie];B[fh];W[gj];B[gf];W[hh];B[jp];W[lq]
;B[hq];W[go]C[inimino: This is very odd, and a chance for b to make things difficult for M3.]
;B[jn];W[ko];B[jo];W[ln];B[ll];W[kl];B[lm];W[pp];B[pq];W[qo]
;B[rp];W[mn];B[pm]C[inimino: Also a strange move, too far away to do any real good.  If b plays O7 or L7 instead here, the game could become quite close.

I suppose this was a bit of a trick play by w hoping to connect...]
;W[km]C[inimino: ...like so.];B[nm];W[kn]C[inimino: So now, again, b is not connected and w is connected.  For b to win now is quite difficult.]
;B[no];W[jk];B[fp];W[gp];B[gq];W[ep];B[fo];W[gn];B[fr];W[eq]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[mq];B[kr];W[np]C[inimino: Mistake by w.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[oo];W[dl];B[fm]C[inimino: F6 is better shape.

The main mistakes I am able to point out in this game are mistakes of direction, not being aware of which groups (your own and opponent's) are weak, and not taking advantage of the global situation to connect your weak groups and put pressure on opponent's.  As a result, w was able to make connections, and made quite a few very poor moves and created many weak groups, but since these groups mostly stayed connected (M3 being an exception) w was able to leave b with little territory.  Try to pay close attention to your weak groups and the opponent's weak groups, and don't underestimate the importance of keeping groups connected.

I end the review here, please let me know if you have any questions.
