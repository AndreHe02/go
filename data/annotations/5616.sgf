C[Im black sanada1 This game was played with a reverse komi of 9.5


This is my second time playing aggresive go
So i would like comments on how to better cut and such
also i would like a full review for each and every move(Well almost (: )

Also thank you for making this review for me
P.s I havnt set any specific comments for each move as i am unsure what i could or could have not done I have only been playing for 2 weeks lol

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'm reviewing this game for you.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

If anything, you attacked too much in this game.  Go is a game of getting more territory than your opponent, not annihilating him.  White didn't defend very well, allowing you to get up early, but you responded by overplaying rather than consolidating.  The only reason Black won is because of an egregious mistake White made costing him the entire bottom left corner.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pn];B[fc]C[Ted: There's playing aggressively, and there's overplaying.  Since you've played a diagonal fuseki, you should eventually be able to approach the D16 stone from one side or the other.  I'd play another move in the bottom right now, and then approach next move.]
;W[mq];B[qq];W[pp]C[Ted: I think White should have played S3 here.]
;B[np];W[or]C[Ted: I don't like this move.  Either White should extend from N3, or try to split Black with Q3.  So what if Black gets a small amount of territory in the corner?  White should get more on both sides.]

;B[lq];W[kq];B[lr];W[kp];B[iq]C[Ted: So far White has made life easy on you, allowing you to get a stable group at the bottom, and allowing himself to be saddled with a weak group.]
;W[ip];B[hp]
(;W[ho]C[Ted: White continues to make it easy for you to split things.  I think I'd play J5 here instead.]

;B[jn];W[jm];B[ko];W[lo];B[qk]C[Ted: I think this move might be a bit far away from Q16.]
;W[dg]C[Ted: I think I would have played this one point lower, at C13.]
;B[ci]C[Ted: I'm not certain I'd jump this far.  White's been obliging you by fighting, and not doing a very good job of it.  Better to consolidate your territory by playing something simpler like C7.]
;W[cn];B[kr];W[mm];B[cm]C[Ted: Attaching moves are usually considered defensive.  Also, I think you may have extended too far from C11.  Watch out for White invading at C9.]

;W[nk];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[nj];B[oj];W[ll];B[ni];W[mj]C[Ted: The proverb, of course, says that the empty triangle is bad.  It's also been written that a net is better for capturing than a ladder.  I'd play M10 instead of N10.]
;B[og];W[sk]C[Ted: Another move from White that I really don't like.]
