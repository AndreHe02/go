;W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[This is standard joseki but does not give any pressure to white group. So white can easily settle group by playing at R7. It is better to extend at S2. In fact, for the chinese fuseki, S2 has become accepted as standard joseki too.]
;W[qm];B[ok];W[dn]C[Notice white did not reply at P9 because it is basically settled and cannot be severly attack even when loacked in at P6 or P7.]

;B[do];W[eo]C[This sequence of exchanges is very bad for black because it got houses in in a very small corner. Also, it made the originally weak seed H3 seems like a good move after connecting to the rest.]
;B[ci]LB[ch:A]C[This is too close to white wall. Better to play at A.]
;W[cg];B[cl]C[Extending so close to white wall is no good. Makes the group relatively weak and susceptible to attack either immediately or at later stage of the game.]
