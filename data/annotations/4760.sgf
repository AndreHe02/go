AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am playing black and ask for your help in two phases of the game:

Firstly after the opening: For me it is very difficult to find a plan and a way of playing - I would be glad to become some advice on how to improve my play

Secondly in the endgame: Although winning with more than 30 points, I think that I lost in this part of the game the initiative and a lot of points.

Thank you for your help.

Hello, In the rest of the review, I'll start all my comments with a * to differentiate them from what you've said. In handicap games, especially 4 stone and above, there is very little opening to the game, one very quickly gets into the middle game. One idea that is often useful is to try keep your stones connected. I'll try focus on that theme in the rest of my review.

Regarding the endgame, its a very very difficult subject. The idea, as you say, is to keep the initiative, and count accurately. More on that in the rest of the review.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[What to play no - there are a lot of possibilities. Would it be better to attack the white stone. For example R7 or R8?

*What to do next is dependant on your playing style.  Your opponent is always at a disadvantage, as you have more stones around. R7 is a bit passive, and R8 (or anything in the area) is bad as it walks into W's plans. See the variations]

(;B[cj]C[I really like this move, I think its one of the best responses you could have made. K3 or K4 might be even better, as they are slightly closer to where the action is. K17 is also a possibility.]
;W[gp];B[dn];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[oq]C[This is not a good move. It provokes a response from W allowing him to strengthen himself. Perhaps an invasion at R12, or something like E3 (giving you the corner and retaining the initiative) would have been better. K17 is also worth considering, though with the C10 stone in place, it is not so good.]
;W[np];B[or];W[nr];B[jc]TR[cj]C[Its a good idea. But 2 stones on the 3rd line (marked) together with a 4,4 stone is not good, as it just begs for a corner invasion.]
;W[je];B[hd];W[kc];B[jd];W[kd];B[ie];W[le];B[jf];W[ke]C[And again I do not know what to play. Strengthen my upper right group or make points in the middle (by F/G10?) oder attack?

* The problem, as you notice, is that your top right is now very weak. F/G10 is not recommended, it builds a potential territory, but is still invadable. As long as you have a plan, there are a number of things you can do. It is important to notice that his L15 group is still weak, so perhaps you can build strength by attacking it, sort of like you did (but see variation)]
;B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[re]C[This move is not recommended, let W invade the corner if he wants, there are more important things happening  (as  in the variation).]
;W[rf];B[mb]C[Is this the right way to prevent white from moving into my corner? Or is it not necessary?

Play N17 instead?

* Your corner was still weak, though a strong player might still be able to live in it (as your stones are on the fourth line. I think its more important to put pressure on his weak groups and keep sente.]
;W[nf]C[Now he is connected (just about)];B[qk];W[qj];B[rk]
;W[rj];B[fq];W[gq];B[fr];W[gr];B[gn]C[Better play C3 or C17 to protect my corners?

Is it necessary to play R3 and R17? I think the right corners are mine - am I right?

* C3 is too meek. something like B4 also protects the corner, and exerts influence upwards. C17 might be a good idea, though B16 might have the same effect and also project power downwards along the side of the board. The top right might be invadeable (I'm not 100% sure), but I think the bottom right is safe. However, you have given W a lot to compensate for saving your corners.]
;W[cc]C[Always block to the wider side. C16 would have been better]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]
;B[ec];W[ej]C[Now he is stealing a lot of points. How to react?

* Calmly :) What you have on the left is potential territory, not territory, so if he takes some of it, its fine. The general idea would be to attack his stone so as to make compensation elsewhere. See variation for example. In fact, his stone should find it very very hard to live, so you should be able to kill it.]

(;B[eh];W[fm]
(;B[gi]C[This is the wrong direction to put pressure on him from. When fighting, try force him into your strength, not away from it.]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[fn]
(;B[el];W[fl];B[ek];W[fj];B[fi]C[No need. The important thing is F5 at the moment.]
;W[fk];B[dj];W[il];B[on]C[Bad move. With his next move, W can take a huge chunk of territory he does not deserve.]
;W[mn];B[nl];W[ll]
(;B[kh]C[This move is too timid. Compare the two variations.]

C[How to react? This stone caused a lot of problems.
*see variation. You will lose some stones, but its no big deal, only a few points, and you get to keep most of the corner.]

;B[sd];W[sf];B[se];W[nb];B[na];W[lb]C[In answer to your later question, here is a point where you could have taken sente. There are bigger moves on the board than the point this response is worth. Its a matter of counting and working out how much it will cost you to ignore a move, and how much profit you can make by ignoring it.]

;B[sm];W[sj];B[rm];W[eo]C[Now would be a good opportunity to take sente somewhere. For example, O1 or B13. Even if he moves to D5, its only 1 point, while those others are much bigger (even if one is gote)]

Besides: I had to make three times ugly endgame moves to protect my stones - I mean the stones around W1, Q1 and T8. How to prevent it - I suppose it is bad shape, but do not know how to improve my play.

*There is not much left to play. The idea is that you make moves that keep sente first. For example K8 is big big big. About your shape, not much you can do about it in the endgame, you should maybe try avoid getting into those situations near the side if you can (think about when those moves were played, and try not play those types of moves in the opening/middle game).]

[cs][rs][ss]C[Overall, you did not play badly at all, especially in the endgame. I suggest reading a book like "attack and defense" to get an idea of what to do in the middle game, it will help your play immensely. Also, life and death problems will help your reading and let you decide when to take sente, and when to defend more.]
