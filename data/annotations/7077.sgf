C[In this game I was white.

Black was ahead in early game but I played better yose.  The game was pretty tight, though black made one big mistake.

I'd like to thank you in advance for the review.

;B[qn]LB[nq:A]C[*** A is most common response here, but the pincer gets played in pro games too.]
;W[pk]TR[pl][ql]C[I'm not sure about this one. Q8/R8 better?

*** No, this is fine. It feels stylistic difference. I think the others are fine too.]
;B[nq];W[oo];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq]LB[mo:A][mp:B]C[*** A or B is correct move for white.  I would play B because of support in lower left corner, but A is possible too and less complicated. I know this position comes up in one of Guo Juan's audiogolessons about common mistakes, but I don't remember which exact one. Worth to watch any of them anyway.]
;W[pm]C[I think this was the only way to attack R6 stone.

*** No, this is a common mistake. Q7 is underplay and too passive way of attacking R6]

(;W[ec]TR[ge]C[This doesn't look right when I look it afterwards. Maybe G15?]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc]C[This result is  good for black.];B[cn]
;W[fq];B[en];W[jn]C[I made this move to confuse black because the moyo on left looked huge. I hoped this stone would help in invasion.

*** Hmmmm. Better to just reduce or invade directly. Should count first and then decide whether invasion or reduction is needed. Invasion should not be very hard, the left is quite open.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[dj];W[gn]C[After black D10 I tried to reduce moyo from outside.

*** good idea];B[iq]
(;W[fl]C[Playing in top right corner is much bigger, I know.... but black wanted to play the sequence]
;B[el];W[fk];B[fm];W[gm];B[mn]C[very small move from black]
;W[nc]LB[qf:A]C[Is this the right direction of playing?

*** I think either this move or  A is fine.];B[qf];W[pb];B[nd]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[qh]C[*** This feels good for White in UR corner]
;B[qj]TR[qn]C[Is there a way to kill both stones? I was thinking Q11 but decided to play at Q10.

*hard, it seems that B can still live even when you play at Q10. This also shows that R7 wasn't particularly useful, since it would be nice to be able to kill after investing quite a lot of stones here.]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[pi]TR[ph]C[Q12 maybe?

** yes, possible, although this seems fine too];B[rh]

I hate it when that happens. Still seems fine though.]
