RE[B+R]US[KJC];W[dc];B[ce];W[gc];B[dh];W[qj];B[qn]C[There is no hurry to pressure the R10 stone since if white puts it into motion by playing around R6 black may take a position around R13 and vice versa.  The reason for white R10 in the first place is to prevent a black sen ran sei (all three star points on one side).  Although R6 is not bad, I might have used the move at K4 which is whitout question a huge point.  In handicap games it is generally good strategy to make a sen ran sei and K4 does just that.]
;W[qg];B[qe]LB[nc:A][mc:B]C[A move at 'a' or 'b' is more natural.  R15 seems cramped and, in light of the fact that STILL the corner is invadable, it seems inefficient.]
;W[cq]C[C3 is way too early.  The result will be that black gets outward influence facing either Q4 or D12 (black's choice).  Typically one invades the corner only after making some sort of move on one of the adjacent sides.]
;B[dq]C[D3 seems the right side to block, but for the resulting wall to be useful
for making territory black must take K4 or K3 before white gets a chance
to play there.  (Note that had black played R6 at K4 this would be an
ideal sequence for black).];W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[bo];B

(;B[mq]C[White beat black to the K4 area.  However, this was not done without cost.  White has ignored C7 to take L4.  If black turns at B7 it makes the left side huge for black.  See variation.]
;W[kr]
(;B[ir]C[J2 certainly takes away white's base, but it does little else (i.e., it gains no territory and has no influence).  Perhaps the variation is better.]
;W[hp]MA[cn][co][cm]C[in the light of what happens to the marked B stones, what does B need to
do here to better handle the situation ?

frakt: White's group at the bottom is very thin and attackable.  The key to attacking is to gain something (e.g., territory and/or thickness) while doing so.  I think black J2 was an error as shown earlier.]

(;B[lc]C[See variation.];W[jc];B[le];W[je];B[fe]C[F15 is a good idea, it makes B7 even bigger.]
;W[pb]C[i didn't quite know how to deal with W31, so i decided to ignore it for a
while.

frakt: Q18 looks a bit unreasonable.  The first step to dealing with it is to understand white's aim.  Clearly white is trying to either link up with K17 or live somehow in the corner.  Since K17 is so far away, I recommend taking the 3-3 point (R17) and making white try to link up.]

C[I think this move would have been better played in the top right to
defend the corner, but where ?

frakt: See eariler.  Incidentally, B7 is the biggest move after black deals with the upper right.]
;W[nb];B[oc]C[hmmm, R17 ?

frakt:  Now its too late, white can play M18.];W[nc];B[lb];W[qc];B[of]C
[This is a disaster.  Note that black outnumbered white four to one in this area.  To be pushed around like this after such an initial advantage is a shame.]

;W[kq];B[jp];W[kn];B[lo];W[ko];B[io];W[fp];B[im];W[fn]C[F6 was to make the D5 cut work.  Now black must defend D5.]
;B[jg]C[K13 makes no sense.  It is extremely far away from the main action.  I don't understand its purpose.]

[cn][co]C[i was sure there must be a way to save the 3 B stones, but if there is a
solution, i completely failed to find it.

frakt:  See eariler comments.  The main problem is that black failed to understand the meaning of F6 when white played it.]

frakt:  It seems black was a bit lucky.  I think the main source of problems (for both b and w) is that the meaning of the opponent's move is not understood.  This happened in at least three places (Q18, F6, D10).]
