C[Scary: Hello, I would like to see about this game... I've lost by a few points and think I know where I lost them, but since this game was without komi, maybe I would lose it anyway and since i'm on a losing streak, I would like to know if it is something wrong that i'm doing...



Hi

My name is Ilan, I am 4k on KGS. I will be doing your review today.
Feel free to send me email about the review.];B[pd];W[qp];B[dp]
;W[cd];B[nq]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[I would rather play the normal approach at A or B.]
;W[kq]
(;B[iq]LB[fq:B][gq:A]TR[dp]C[the main other problem with this move, is this extension is unsafe. still big holes at g3 and f3]
;W[pq]LB[iq:B][nq:A]C[After w now guards the corner, The Q3/R4 stones are quite strong. and the L3 stone is spliting black into 2. Either the A stone will be attacked later, or the B stone.]
;B[no];W[pn];B[ko];W[gq]
(;B[jp]LB[ir:A]C[Scary: Maybe this was to carefull... What about J4 or G5?


This move looks solid to me. Stops the J2 connecting move, and makes the entire group alive,
however you are right in the aspect that it is small. 5 black stones making little territory.]
;W[dr];B[eq]C[Scary: Think this was useless... Maybe I should have play at C3 instead...

If you want influence, you can play this way.];W[er]
(;B[cl]C[This move seems out of sink with plan.];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[fq]C[White now has corner, and access to outside.]
(;B[fp]C[This move is gote. Probably better to play elsewhere]
;W[gp];B[fo]C[Not much territory / influence gained from the gote move. Now w takes sente else where]
;W[fc]
(;B[kc]LB[mc:B][nc:A]TR[pd]C[This extension from the Q16 stone looks unusual. Again 2 weaknesses at O17/N17]
;W[qf]C[Giving w this extension is too good for white];B[qj]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qh]C[This move is a mistake for white.]
(;B[qm]C[I don't advise shoulder hitting.  If you can avoid it. you should.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[on]TR[pm][no]C[This exchange of the shoulder hits, has damaged both the Q7 stone and the O5 stone.]
;B[oj];W[oh]
(;B[me]TR[ld]C[too small. and bad shape];W[ld]C[White does not need to instantly abuse this weakness. This move in my eyes looks quite greedy for white. 

It actually is beneficial for black that w does this now, and not abuse it later.

However, that still does not mean that the end result will be good, it just means it will be a better outcome rather than w abusing the aji later]
(;B[lc]C[Scary: Maybe N16 instead?];W[md];B[mc];W[nd];B[nc]

(;B[ph];W[rg]C[losing S14 stone was too much];B[rh];W[sf];B[og]
C[Now the O16 stones are connected to corner, so this move doesn't do much.

small gote move];W[cj]C[w takes large point]
(;B[cg]C[When reducing, usually not the best idea to play right in the middle. 

Problem now, is you have no clear follow ups after this move]
;W[ej];B[ef];W[fe];B[dc]C[Scary: To deep right?

My previous moves showed how to invade the large keima properly.]

Ilan: The biggest thing you need to work on is avoiding gote moves, and always playing for sente. there were a number of times where u played a small gote move without looking at the entire board and seeing if there was something else.

Good game!])
