S.

Why did black win?

He made a good reduction where he captured 5 stones and reduced white's teritory by 12 points, its very big

White's play fell apart when black played that one move in the center

White played a little passive where he should have been agressive in order to catch up with his handicap

Over all black played a solid game though

BW:  your play in the beginning emphasized influence over terrritory, which is fine, but you didn't use your influence to attack or to surround territory well in the center.  if i were you i'd read some books on positional judgement, influence, attack and defense, and the endgame.  good luck.  see you around.
