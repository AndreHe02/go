C[From the very beginning of the game (during the first twenty moves) i felt not in control, trying to find a way out, but the blunder only getting bigger from move to move.

Hi Agora,

Thanks for sharing this game. It was very exciting. 

Here are the biggest lessons from this game:


Don't attack your opponent when your own group is weak. Don't tenuki in the middle of a fight. Stabilize your own groups first, before you attack.

I hope the review is helpful to you. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Norman314 on KGS];B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[cd];B[op]C[Corner approach seemed best at this stage. I chose high approach to coordinate with the two star point stones.

Looks good so far.];W[mp];B[qn]TR[op]SQ[po]C[I got mixed up with the 4x4 point joseki, but did not see it as a severe mistake at the time.

Well, I don't know this joseki very well, but this move looks wrong. The shape of the triangled stones is called an elephant's jump. It leaves a major weakness, the elephant's eye, at the squared spot. You should only play this way if you are strong enough locally to allow the two stones to be split.]

;W[pn];B[qm];W[fd]
(;B[jp]C[This seemed to work well with the black stone in the lower left corner, while pincering the white stone


This is a gutsy move, maybe asking for too much. If it were me, I think I would try to stabilize one of my weak groups with N5 or R10. N5 would also strengthen both sides, whereas this move starts a fight. But black is starting a fight with bad shape, after having his elephant eye cut.]
;W[mn];B[pq]C[After white's move, the two black stones were almost blocked from the top, and i looked for connection / eyes from the bottom.
Looking back this seems like a bad move, allowing white to attack the other two black stones.]
;W[qq];B[mq];W[qk]
(;B[qi]C[Maybe this pincer is weak, with the two black stones isolated.

Again, you should strengthen your weak groups before embarking on an attack. An attack is rarely successful when you are trying to attack with a weak group.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[rj]
(;B[cj]C[Probably to soon to tenuki?

Yes, too soon to tenuki. Don't tenuki when there are unsettled groups on the board, except for a very urgent tenuki. C10 is big, but not urgent.  The bottom right is an urgent fight. None of the stones, black or white, are settled.]

(;W[nq];B[np]
(;W[mo]C[this way, white helped black. Now black is starting to build a nice base.]
;B[lq];W[jd]C[Big move for white. But maybe he should think about playing Q7 instead to shut down black's aji in the lower right. But overall, I think this move is decent for white.]

(;B[mc];W[lc];B[ld];W[lb];B[le];W[dg]
(;B[cq]C[I felt un settled on the lower right, i looked for quick stability.
Looking back this is contrary to my opening..

Hard for me to say. This is a big move, defending against the corner invasion. But maybe it's better to play on a larger scale.]

White is being greedy, playing tenuki while he still has a weak group.]

(;B[go]C[Black takes advantage, buliding territory on the bottom while attacking. But beware of the possible weakness of the black group in the center right.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[fl];B[fk];W[fm];B[hk];W[dk]C[Now white has lived. Black's attack is over, and black is left with an unsettled group in the left center.]

(;W[jg]C[At this point, black's stones in the top center are okay. I would consider tenukiing to defend the top right. If black can't get a good chunk of territory on the top right, then white will win.]

[rn][sn][qo][ro][so][rp][sp][rq][sq]C[Overall i was satisfied with finally getting some black shape somewhere in the board, even though at great cost

Let's stop to consider the balance of territory.

The triangled points are pretty solidly black. 54 points. THe squared points are pretty solidly white. 78 points. Black has a lot of potential in the top right, but nothing definite, and a little bit of potential in the center. Black essentially has to get 20 or so points in the top right in order to stay in the game. So there's no time to play slow moves like K12. K12 stabilizes a group that is already reasonably safe. It doesn't make much territory, because white has ways to get into the center from the left and from the right. Playing here is too slow for black.]
;W[nb];B[pb];W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[qc];W[rh]C[This point took me by surprise, i did not see the severity of it.

White's T2 group has way more liberties than the enclosed black group. The black group has six liberties. A five point big eye is worth eight liberties. S1 will not be enough to seriously threaten white. 

And anyway if black plays s1 right away, white can live with Q7.So black must play both Q7 and S1 to have any chance of killing the white group.]

There's no way to kill the bottom right corner, white has too many liberties there.  The black group on the bottom right side has only six liberties. Now it's game over.]
