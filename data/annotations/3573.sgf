AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello GTL Reviewer,
This is my third game, played on KGS.

Black : izharx (1k)

White : evilsaint (12k)

Handicap : 4

Please feel free to correct anything that seems wrong. Thank you very much in advanyou will suffer.ce.

[ian\] i have marked my comments like this. Thankyou for the chance to review your game. I have indicated some thoughts i had and left some variations as well. Please realise though they are only some things to think about - only the pro's have the answers. 

On the whole i think you played pretty well and were a little unlucky to lose. Perhaps you should concentrate more on making your groups strong before you attack and cause fights. it is better to fight when you are strong and, especially in handicap games, if you fight where you are not strong, you will be punished.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fq]LB[dn:A]
(;B[hq]TR[nq]C[[ian\] I think this pincer is unusual, the marked white stone will help to attack the pincer stone.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[ip];B[hp]LB[nc:A]C[I dont' think here's a good move. Where should I move to save my stone ? if if giving up my stone then the white will have a strong group right ?
[ian\] 
it's not necessarily a bad move- the variation i have shown across the top is a joseki, perhaps the choice of a pincer is strange though...]

(;W[ho]C[Then here I playing stupid till i lose them all];B[iq]
;W[jp]
(;B[gp]LB[jq:A]C[[ian\] this weakness in white's shape is key, but it's too soon to attck, i think. 
a push again at A gives black more liberties];W[fp];B[go];W[gn]
;B[hn];W[io];B[fn];W[gm];B[eo];W[fm];B[en];W[jq]C[[ian\] when white takes this point black is in serious trouble

[ian\] black needs to occupy the marked point earlier];B[jr]
;W[kr]
(;B[ir];W[gr];B[qf]LB[jd:B][pj:A]C[[ian\] generally with star point stones a big move, such as A or B, is bigger than an extension.]
;W[fc]TR[hc][ic][hd][id]C[[ian\] the black stones on the right suggest that maybe a pincer at one of the marked points might be a good move here.]

(;B[cf];W[dl]LB[hc:3][di:1][dr:2]TR[cf]C[Here I have 2 tought

1. is to stopping white increase their territory.

2. Is to make my lower group alive since they don't have eye yet.

I chose one in this game, but is there any option beside my tought ? If there is,  what is the proper move ?

[ian\]
i think i would play 2, the lower group looks weak.

3 is another option to attack white's single stone 

however, as the game continues, 1) looks like a good move because it helps the bottom left group indirectly and makes black stronger from the outside as well]

(;B[di];W[dr];B[el]TR[di][fm][gm][gn]C[[ian\] i really like this move - it highlights the marked stones' shorness of liberties, and because to the marked black stone, attacking the black group below looks like it was a mistake by white.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[dk]
(;B[fk];W[hl];B[fj]LB[fi:A]C[[ian\] from a shape point of view, i would like to play at A, but it seems quite complicated]

(;W[cm]C[a mistake by white, at A is ok, i think.];B[bn];W[bf]
;B[bi]C[better to play at b8 directly];W[bh];B[bl]C[[ian\] taking these stones is big for black - all his left hand stones are safe now.]
;W[ql]LB[qj:A]
(;B[on]LB[qj:A]C[[ian\] i think i would play A here];W[ol];B[mn]
;W[km]
(;B[mm]C[[ian\]  i don't understand this move. if you want to attack white, better to play as in the variation,

better still attack the top left stone];W[qh]
(;B[pk]C[[ian\] too soon

and too aggressive to atack white directly. perhaps it would be better to build strength...]
;W[pl];B[ok]TR[pk]C[[ian\] heavy, i think. better to leave the marked stone as a forcing move and play elsewhere]
;W[qk];B[nk];W[pi];B[ni]C[[ian\] this seems slow to me. i would pincer the top left stone (still ;-)  )]
;W[og]
(;B[mg]C[[ian\] attacking from this direction doesn't make any territory, black should attaxk from the top, taking territory at the same time]
;W[oe];B[od];W[mf]LB[md:A]
(;B[nf]LB[md:A]C[Is this any good ? I just trying to stop white here.
where is the proper move ?

[ian\] i think i would play at A t try to take but the move you played is aggressive and looks good.]
