AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer, this game is a 3 stone handicap game against GNU go, in which I played as white. Please review for both sides. thank you in advance.

** I'll mark my comments with two asterisks like this.  I believe a lot of the later awkwardness in the game came from an agressive fuseki.  If you make solid groups, rather than floating groups, you'll be able to do aggressive attacks with confidence instead of feeling like each new move hurts some other group on the board.  It is ok to allow your opponent some profit in fuseki.]
;W[pp];B[dj];W[fq];B[hq];W[go]C[This move is probably abnormal, but I was trying to avoid forcing black to strenthen his left side, and it seemed too early to invade the 3-3 point.

** If black strengthened the left side anyway, would you feel comfortable with this position?]

(;B[qn];W[mq]C[** This feels like a stretch to help the weak left side]
;B[qk];W[fc]C[** I feel like the bottom is left is now in shambles (or will be if black moves there first).  There's a weak black stone in the middle of two weak white groups.  You owe at least one move to clean it up.]
;B[id];W[ge];B[kq];W[lo];B[dm];W[cq]C[This jump seemed a little early, but it was the only attempt I could see to avoid running with the f3 stones.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[dg]C[** This weak white group *has* to give black protit down the road as fights break out.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[ne];B[if];W[gg];B[of];W[lf]C[** Will this move generate profit?  You're getting a lot of awkward jumps into the center.]

** I think that this move is unreasonable given your weak group.  A peep with E16 would make me feel a lot better about attacking.]
