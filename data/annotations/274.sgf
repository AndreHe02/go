 lecates 25k : this is new joseki for me - thought id try it out
 lecates 25k : but you threw me with s3 - didn't know what to do

There is a lot of variations following q8, but s3 is not one of them.  If White want to go in the corner, the correct move is A. Usually White jumps  to B or C.]

(;B[np]C[This is slow.];W[qq];B[po];W[pr];B[oq]M[np]C[Black should feel that the marked stone is useless.  Black is overconcentrated, while White takes the corner easily.]
;W[jc]M[ed]C[This is a bad move. White did not answer to the marked stone. This was  possible.  But now that he gets sente, he should answer.

k17 is also bad because it allows Black to play h17 which attacks k17,  extends from the marked stone and is sente.]
;B[hc]C[Good. Correct direction.];W[mc];B[qn];W[ro];B[cc];W[dd]L[df]
C[Dubious. In fact, I don't see any good answer  for White.  May be A. White should have played in the corner first.]

 lecates 25k : i think my next move was bad - you have idea on this?];B
[fd]C[smount 25k : Yes, I think my group at c15 would have  been very weak after D13

Indeed. After D13, Black should welcome the fight. White has 2 weak groups to  take care of (c15 and e15).]
;W[dg]C[
 lecates 25k : i think you r right, i was just afraid to lose strength  facing your K17 - panicked :(

Now, instead of 2 weak groups, White has one strong. The result is clearly  favorable for White.]
;B[nc]L[ne][oc]C[Bad move. If you make a contact move, you will  make your opponent stronger.  As you want to attack, you don't want to make him stronger.

What about A? Black extends his moyo on the right side while making pressure  on the 2 White stones.

B seems also possible. It takes an option on the corner, but is less  effective as pressure on the White stones.]
;W[bc]C[Bad timing. This  is a big Yose move. But this is only 32, and it is Gote.]
;B[bb];W[ad];B[he]L[md]C[Black should now continue his attack and play A instead.]
;W[je]C[
 lecates 25k : your upper left seems strong now - bad for black i think]
;B[md]M[he][je]C[What has Black gained with the exchange or the marked  stones? Not much. 37 is just less effective.]

 smount 25k : What do you think of my last two moves?
 lecates 25k : i think i moved to quickly next :)];B[kb]L[fq][cn][ck]
C[
 lecates 25k : i like your H14

lecates asked my opinion specifically on this move: 'One specific question -  I'd like your opinion on move #41,  black diving into white's top position. I felt later like I should have tried  to split Whites two top side groups instead.   Especially after White 42'.

With 40, White chooses to go out, thus the top side is not important. 41 is a  small move. White then plays firmly with h14.

On the other hand, what can you gain in trying to split White?  White top-left group is strong, and the right group has plenty of options (on  the top or into the center).
If he goes to the center, this will certainly help to reduce or invade your  moyo on the right side.

The best think to do with 41 is to play elsewhere. May be in the lower left  corner at A or B, or on the side at C.]
;W[hf]C[
 lecates 25k : i like your position now
 lecates 25k : i confess I looked at this for a few minutes last night
 smount 25k : Well, Let's see how it plays out.
 lecates 25k : i think I should have tried h14 before you did?
 smount 25k : I looked at it a little too, so we're even :)

Good answer. This left the top side, but it takes great influence .];B[le]

(;B[ie]C[Useless. If you want to take  something on the upper side, try l16]
;W[kc]C[Must protect the cut with k14 or  k13.];B[mb]M[ck]L[cn][ch]
C[Still small. Do something with the marked stone at A or B];W[lc]C[How much points is this move worth? 5?

White should now protect the cutting point, attack the Black stone on the  left,  or reduce the moyo on the right. I think this is the loosing move.]
;B[ia]C[Very bad. What is the purpose of this move?];W[qf]C[OK. White decides to  invade. However, this seems very deep. (Humbly, I don't know where to  invade).]
;B[qe]C[Good.];W[pf]L[qi]C[Should extend on the side (A), to have a  better base.]
;B[qi]C[Very good.];W[og];B[mg];W[oi];B[mi];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[jf]C[At first glance, I thought this was out of purpose.  Now I think this is a good move. White has now 2 weak groups to take care of.]
