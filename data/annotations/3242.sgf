C[Game played on DragonGo Server

Hi, I'm Michaeljohn Clement, I'll do my best to point out a few useful things.  Please check the variations.]

(;B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[ed]LB[fd:A]C[Is F6 better here for black?

Yes, much better.  E6 is a losing move.  If w doesn't make big mistakes after this point b cannot win.  There are at least two alternatives, see the variations for F8 and F6 at this point.  Both are complicated and could have many possibilities.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[ff];B[ge];W[fg];B[ec];W[fb]
(;B[cc]LB[eb:A]C[Is E8 better instead, to chase white?

E8 in fact it does more than chase white, it captures the three stones and wins the game.  Please see the variations.  Can w escape after C7?  See the variation with the next move at G6.]

(;W[dd]C[see the variation which looks better for w.];B[dc]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ef];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]
(;B[cg]LB[bb:A]C[Should I have played at A instead?

Yes, check the variation.];W[dg]

(;B[eb]CR[ie]C[H5 would have been better, protected the H4 eye.  Playing at E8 allows W to play J5.

--

Actually, H5 loses the game.  E8 is correct, it was the next two moves of yours that were not quite the best.]
;W[ie]C[w should play at C8 to capture the E8 stones.];B[he]
C[Very big mistake.  G6 or G8 are the only options for b for this move.]

(;W[hf]C[w made a mistake here, see the variation for a line where w can win on this move.]
;B[id]C[Again G6 or G8 is essential.];W[if]C[and again w should play at C8]
;B[gd]
(;W[ic]C[w should play at G8 instead.]
(;B[hd]C[this was the last chance for b.  you can only play G8 at this point.  If you play at G8, all of w's stones are dead (yes, all of them!) Please see the variation.]
;W[gb]C[Game over at this point.  This is the end of the review.

This was a very exciting and dramatic game, with lots of fighting.  The best way to learn from a game like this is to study every reasonable variation which of course takes quite some time.  You may also want to study some life and death problems.]
