AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I played this game in KGS, it was a game with very slow time settings in which i tried to give everything i have, and so did the other player, I think.

I am white.
I might have won by resignation but it wasn't an easy game at all.

<Svante> Hello, I am your reviewer.];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]
;W[cc];B[fe]C[Black 6 seems dubious to me.

<Svante> Yes, Black is lacking a base. However, don't expect too much from this, since Black does have the very active hoshi stones around the board.]
;W[kc]C[I decided to wariuchi so b  would either be baseless or play the not so attractive extension at j17.

<Svante> This is a very good point.];B[mc];W[hc];B[fg];W[dh]

(;B[hd]C[Black 12 seems to make good shape for him, but also for w, not sure its a good move.

<Svante> After the exchange of F13 for D12, Black has become strong enough to either tenuki or attack White. This, as you already remarked, is a defensive move, strengthening both sides, so it helps White more than Black here.]
;W[id];B[he]
(;W[ie]C[i didnt know how to play locally, maybe m15?

<Svante> How about G17? That's a shape point.];B[qj]
(;W[nq]C[Is this the biggest point?

<Svante> Looks natural, though you could have split the lower side with K3, too. Apart from this, G17 still is a nice point.]
;B[jp]C[k4 seems a good move here, i really didnt want to m3 or 05.

<Svante> I would prefer to pincer a bit closer, because Black has no big aspirations in the left centre.]
;W[qq]TR[mn][nn][lo][mo][no][lp][mp]C[san san seems to give b a nice framework and  r10 being low is kinda annoying for w.

<Svante> Usually, I like the simple moves, too. However, in this handicap game, White may feel the need not to make things too simple. The immediate double approach doesn't seem too promising, too, so perhaps you have to find some way to jump out here. This might work with any of the marked points. White would be aiming at either the double approach on the right or a splitting move around G4. Creating a non-standard situation gives you opportunities to outthink your opponent.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[om]
(;W[nr]C[i decided to activate this stone inmediately, not sure its a good idea.

<Svante> Apart from G17, I would tend to play C6, which is big.]

(;B[os]C[<Svante> Splitting with Q1 would have a bit more implications for the corner.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[no];B[oo];W[lo]C[Seems w came out fairly well, still weak but cant expect much more. Could do b better than the game?

<Svante> White isn't out quite yet. Except Q1 instead of P1, I don't think that Black had significantly better options here. Please note that even so, your corner is not unscathed. You didn't get these moves for free.]
;B[jn]C[k6 seems a good move.

<Svante> I like it, too.];W[mm]C[i couldnt find any shape better than this.]
;B[ql]C[this  black move seems kinda slow.

<Svante> Look carefully. I will assume for now that you have read out that you can survive S5. However, because of R5, Black is quite strong now in this area as he can't be cut. White has not accomplished much except installing a weakish group.]

(;W[re]C[i considered c6 too, but decided this was bigger.

<Svante> I am not so sure about that. C6 does stake out a chunk of the board for White, while this invasion just destroys a little of Black's potential and also likely produces another weak group.]

(;B[rd]C[Black 40 seems bad. w settles easily.];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[should b r17?

<Svante> Yes.];W[qc];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[od]C[i was happy with this result

<Svante> Yes, it is good for White, because he has L17.]
(;B[me];W[of]C[splitting looked important to me.

<Svante> I like this move.]
(;B[nf]C[<Svante> This doesn't help Black.];W[og];B[ke]C[i thought this b move was kinda weird.]
;W[if]TR[ke]SQ[nf][og]C[<Svante> These exchanges are very bad for Black.]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[cj]C[to me it looked like b tenukied  too early.

<Svante> Yes, the interesting points seem to be at the right side, around N12. One could say that Black weakened his N15 stones with two moves "in preparation" for a tenuki, which is obviously not a good idea.]

(;W[mh]C[i wanted to make all my groups safe before focusing on territory.
considered m13 too.

<Svante> I think that this is good, though G17 would be a good preparation first.]
;B[lg]
(;W[ej]C[w 59 didnt work as i expected. b could cut it and i was busy for a while. considered f11 and d10 too.

<Svante> Why not continue the attack around M12? It is a very important shape point. Answering a shoulder hit is very basic and surely more urgent than fiddling around at other points here.]
;B[ei];W[di];B[dj];W[ek];B[dg]C[this was fairly good for b getting some shape in sente]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[bi];B[cl]C[Suddently im left with a  lonely group i didnt really want.

<Svante> Especially when you are behind, like when playing a handicap game, you have to develop a view on what is really the most important thing on the board. You will often need to sacrifice the second or third important thing to get it. Here, you want to attack the black stones on the top. Your stones on the left will have to wait - they cannot be neutralized with one move, and they make black feel uncomfortable with white moves around K11.]

(;W[hk]C[<Svante> Like this, you make these stones heavy.];B[bj]
;W[ci];B[gi]C[i was a bit relieved because i feared b h11];W[gc]
C[<Svante> Finally. This was a very important point throughout the game.]
;B[fd];W[ij];B[cb]C[i think b looked for eyes too early, his m13 group looks really weak now.]
;W[jh];B[gk]C[<Svante> Black should read carefully if his group really needs more moves. If so, taking the corner at B17 is a much bigger way to live, also because he wouldn't damage his outside position so much that way.]
;W[gl];B[ii];W[ji];B[ih];W[jg]C[<Svante> I am not sure if Black can live with N17 now...]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[fj];W[hl];B[dn]C[b 88 seems kinda offtopic to me.
also it offers me the option to play d8 in sente];W[dl];B[dm]
;W[mj]C[i could probably kill the upper group but i wanted to be 100% thick in the board to enter the yose firmly.

<Svante> Knitting together your outside groups seems a good idea, especially since It is not clear that Black can live even now.]
;B[kb]
(;W[jb];B[lc];W[kd];B[ld];W[mg]C[considered o18, which was probably a better move]
;B[ob];W[oi]C[im aiming r13 and q8 with this move, also protecting the cut. At this point i felt i had a good game and didnt mind b living in gote.

<Svante> Q8 doesn't work at all, and R13 is just a few points reduction.]
;B[nd];W[pb];B[la];W[nb];B[mb];W[nc];B[ne]
(;W[fq]C[i thought about this a lotl, but i think i played the wrong move.
 I see no reason not to play g4 now.];B[go];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr]
;B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[cn];W[do];B[eo];W[cp]

(;B[ml]C[Black seems to be trying to defend against q8 in a way.

<Svante> Q8 is no threat anyway. You can rather assume that this is a preparation for S5.]
;W[ll];B[mn];W[ln];B[mp]C[i hadnt seen this.];W[lp];B[kq]C[l3 really pissed me off, it was so big.

<Svante> Good moves by Black.]
(;W[qg]C[i];B[nm];W[lm];B[lq]C[i didnt expect b to tenuki r13
this is big and i need compensation now];W[rb];B[rg];W[rh]
(;B[qh]C[<Svante> Black is not reading at all here.];W[qi];B[ph]
;W[ri];B[pi];W[pj];B[pg];W[qk];B[pf];W[pl]C[i guess its fairly ok for white.

<Svante> No. It is fantastic for White, since he finally got rid of the S5 threat and made some nice territory.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[oe];W[oc];B[sb];W[ra];B[bc];W[bd]
(;B[oj]C[connecting b18 seems sente for black, and huge.

<Svante> Huge yes, but I fail to see the sente.];W[rj];B[oh]

;W[in];B[im];W[ko];B[gn]
(;W[hm]TR[ab][bb][ac][bc][jk][il][jl][im]C[was the corner bigger than this gote? i think so.

<Svante> I marked the areas that would likely change ownership. I think that it is a close call.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[lh]C[m12 and successive b moves look like misread.]
;W[ni];B[li];W[mi];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[lf]C[weird.

<Svante> Not weird, just an oversight.];B[kf];W[mf];B[le];W[kg]
C[seems big enough to be game over.];B[ng]C[smaller than corner.]
;W[bb];B[dc];W[ac]
(;B[ol]C[<Svante> Black should play Q1 first.];W[pm];B[ib];W[ja]
;B[ic];W[jc]C[here b resigned.

<Svante> Both players need to look more carefully. Especially Black has to build the stamina to keep his eyes open throughout the game. I know that this is hard. White should not assume that he can get moves like O2 etc. for free. Also, had Black taken a bit of advantage out of White invading at S15 with another group still weak, White would have had a much harder time.

Black also needs to avoid getting closed in. Bad moves in this respect were H16, O14, L15, G11. If he does get closed in, he needs to read very sharply to see if he has to add moves to live; then, he needs to find the moves that live in the least damaging way for the rest of the board. The moves around G9 and J11 were very bad in this respect.

I liked how Black handled the invasion at O2 etc. and how White calmly patched up his centre with N10.]
