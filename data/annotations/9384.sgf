C[Hello to my reviewer! I played black in this game, and I would like general comments on all aspects of the game. I will mark my questions and comments with "M".

Results: W + Resignation


G: Hello,

I'm glad I could comment this game. All in all the game was fun, with lots of tactics and strategies.

Go is a game where players have to find the right moves at the right moments. The right moves depend on the player to though so some moves are just about preferances. I have commented your game but keep a critical aproach on the game as you should always.

All in all I think the biggest things to do to keep improving are: 
 1. Play more games
2. Do go problems 
3. Play more games.

Keep an eye out for cuts, try to always have a good idea of which cuts need to be defended or not. You could save a couple of moves from that. 

Also attacking is good but if you're in a position where you HAVE TO KILL then it gets more complicated. Try and take advantage of your opponents weak groups to pressure them while strengthening your own stones and while getting more territory :D

Thats it!!!!!!!!!
Ps: I don't know if I gave you the 4th tip yet:
4. Play more games

Good day
Keep having fun];B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qn];B[qk]C[M: should bR9 have been at R10?

G: R10 would make a more solid shape with the pair stones in the top right corner BUT It would put less pressure on the white stone at R6 therefore both moves are ok it's just a question of preferences.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]
(;B[ok]CR[no]C[G: The idea of 13 is not bad, put pressure on the white stone R6 and create a moyo at the top with the corner inclosure.

O5 is better because that's the pushing point (the border of influence ) for both white and black. Black keeps white under pressure and has more potential for the right side.

If black plays O5 he still has P9 for later when the white R6 stone tries to run away.]
;W[op];B[pn]C[G: This looks like a good shape but the empty triangle might have been better here Q5 instead of Q6.]
;W[rp];B[iq]C[M: I felt like my group that was fighting was fairly safe so I tried to play a big point

G: It's a good move, you shouldn't ponder about the Q4 group ...]

;W[qg];B[og];W[pk];B[pl];W[pj];B[qm];W[rn];B[ij]C[M: Now that I look back at this game, it feels like I jump around too much (?). The white group on the right hand side is not safe, but my position has some cutting points which white is about to exploit.

G: Black has a game built on quickness and doesn't have any certain territory yet but a lot of potential. There are two groups that black can exploit: D12 and Q11 group.

Cutting is part of go and the surroundings are favouring black. 

This last move (J10) is understandable but seeing as D10 is a bit weak and I would have played F10. Bring the fight on.]
;W[fh];B[fj];W[ol]C[G: Let the fight start];B[mk]CR[pl][pn]
[oo][qm][qk]C[G: P9 is a bit weak and the N9 extention doesn't totally help it up. O9 would be way better: it also puts more pressure on the white cutting stone.

These stones are key stones in the fight because if they die the white right group ont the right side lives.]
;W[nk];B[oj];W[nl]
(;B[em]CR[pl][qm][pn][oo][qk]C[G: There is a big fight going on and you don't want to lose space. E7 is to early.

The black group on the right side is important right now, the way to go is N6.]
;W[fp];B[mn]C[G: LOL

Now the cost of doing this move one turn later is that you have to let white have F4, which is really big.]
;W[ml];B[kn]C[G: You have to watch out this fight white can cut black with a sequence starting at P7.]

(;W[kl];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[in];W[kj];B[kh]C[G: L12 and J10 make a bad shape, it can be cut really easily. Therefore L12 should be used when one knows how to deal with the cut. Here for example black could take a couple of moves to start capitalising on the top moyo.]
;W[ji]C[G: expected];B[hh]C[G: Black could play K12 to start capitalising.]

C[G: N11 is better, less weaknesses.];W[kg];B[mh];W[ig];B[gg]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[ci]
(;B[be]C[G: C10 is probably better, bye not playing B15 earlier in the game you had accepted maybe not to have alot of side territory.

B15 lets white connect at the bottom but bye playing D10 instead and giving white a lil on the side you could have captured some stones and get more points out of this exchange.]

(;B[dk]C[G: This move is good because it gives you a cutting possibility now. And you never know what that could bring. But I think S9 and P7 have been very important for a while.]

(;W[rk]
(;B[ql];W[id]C[G: Since white decided not to answer your D9 move that treatens a cut, he'll have to keep that in mind now.]
;B[hc];W[hf];B[lm];W[il];B[hl];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[jn]
;B[jo];W[jm];B[go]C[G4 is better here. U don't have to connect because the two sides will be alright if white cuts.]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[gq];B[ir]C[M: This move should have been at H10, I think. I was bloodthirsty, and not focusing on the double cut point at H10 and K10.

G: yeah the situation in the fight is a bit complicated but then white will still only have 1 eye for sure.]
;W[ik];B[jj]C[Defending on the left side: h10 looks good to since the eye at K14 seems to have some weak points. Then later you'd still have the cut at C9.

Anyhow, black is low on territory now so big moves should be made and I can understand the K10 move]

[fj][fi][ei]C[M: At this point I realized that the marked group was going to die or bigger if I connected at E10, so I let it die.]
;W[ej]C[g: Now you have aim for the cut at L11];B[ki]C[G: Nice]
;W[el];B[dm];W[dn];B[ab]C[G: You had good sente moves going for you at the C8, you should have pushed a bit longer before going on to A19.]
