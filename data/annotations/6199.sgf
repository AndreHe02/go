AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer,

This game I played on KGS as white.

I would be very pleased to get some advice regarding my style of playing.

Until midgame I thought to play a good game. My oppenent formed 3 weak groups but i was incapable of killing even one of them.

I am mainly interested in advice regarding the opening and the middle game, but of course every comment is welcome. Thank you very much in advance!

DrPepper: Overall, your play was fine, but it seems you have a tendency towards jealousy of your opponent's potential areas and are too eager to play there instead of developing your own areas. I think you should also try to attack on a larger scale if it is unclear how any small-scale fighting will go.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq]LB[nc:A][cn:D][qn:C][nq:B]TR[qf][fq]C[DrPepper: If you notice, 4 out of 6 of the possible approaches will push black towards his own stones. If you are concerned, then, about breaking black up early, then either of the triangle points will do (of course black could then pincer anyway). That said, I would personally prefer "A" or "B" to work with my own star point stone. 

Regardless of the handicap, white has to make her stones work very hard, and "A" or "D" are fine points for that.]
;B[qn];W[pr]C[DrPepper: This is a fine joseki. Some might say that you should tenuki instead of finishing this out. I think you are ok. Tenuki is possible instead of sliding, but you will then have to manage "unfinished business" all over the board. It can be too much for some people's styles.]
;B[qq];W[kq]TR[dp][pp]SQ[nq]C[DrPepper: Essentially, white has played in an area where she was outnumbered. We could consider this an invasion. Black has chosen a joseki where white settles very easily. Probably black could have considered pincering. Locally, this is an even joseki, but globally white has gained.]

(;B[gq];W[nc]C[I played o17 because of the big potential on the upper side, but maybe i played into the hands of my opponent because i strenghtend the right side where he made big points later.

DrPepper: It is a good point to play. Sure, he is making something, but you are developing from D16 as well. Be sure to not pick just a one-sided analysis, "Oh, black's going to coordinate his stones," especially if you are also coordinating your stones. Especially in handicap games, it seems like anywhere we play helps our opponent, but of course this is not true, else there wouldn't be a handicap ;)]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[jc]LB[lc:A]C[I think I like the tighter "A". One, it is more seriously aiming at P16 push. Two, it limits black's forcing moves at N15 helping him much in case of a leaning attack when you want to get around to handling the right side. Three, it makes development down the D line from your star point much more ambitious. We'll look at it later.]
;B[qf]C[he drifts of the joseki , is there a way to punsih this?

DrPepper: Its low form is practically its own punishment, but a shoulder hit is conceivable.]

(;W[gc]C[maybe playing around q10 would have been better?

DrPepper: Of the two sides, D10 side and Q10 side, only one of them would constitute a big fuseki point as the last area to establish a base for our stones. Q10 is not that side.]

(;B[pj];W[ph]LB[qh:A]C[DrPepper: If you are not going to invade at "A", leave the situation. This half-hearted play doesn't usually accomplish anything good.]
;B[nj];W[nh];B[dj]C[DrPepper: Ouch.];W[pf];B[pe];W[qg];B[of]
;W[og]C[DrPepper: Good. Connection is nonsense.];B[pg];W[qi]
;B[qj]LB[qi:A][qj:B]C[DrPepper: This exchange has not helped white.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[pf];B[cf];W[qe];B[qd];W[cn]LB[qf:A];B[qf];W[bp]
;B[rg];W[cq]LB[rh:A]C[DrPepper: White could almost certainly have forced at "A" first, then taken C3 anyway. C3 and C8 are miai for white.]
;B[pg];W[lh]C[Overall, this was a success for white.];B[qh]
C[DrPepper: Overall, black has invested 18 stones on the right side. He has just over two points per stone, which is quite modest in terms of efficiency. Do not be so concerned. (As the final score will show, black barely won the game.)]
;W[dq]C[DrPepper: I think this is kind of slow. Capturing just D4 would be too little of a gain. Since your group was settled fine after C3 you should aim for something more ambitious. J3, E3, E5, E6, or even G5 are all sound plans. C16 can help, too.]
;B[ep]C[DrPepper: This is a heavy way for Black to play.];W[bj]
C[is this a proper move to handle the left side?

DrPepper: It's hard to say. You don't have so much influence here, so D10 is fairly light. Since C17 is open, C14 will not have a hard time. Black's entire formation, such as it is, on the left is more or less light (E4, ok, not) and flexible. Since you are not sure what to do about D10/C14, work on the E4 group, in which black has the most investment already. Think about black's weaknesses at C12 and your open corner. How can you manipulate one group to hurt the other? The most successful splitting attacks drive groups close together, then you play to split them at that time, when the split has the most force.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[nn]C[i tried to reduce his potential but i was uncertain of the right place.

DrPepper: The right side is simply going to be overconcentrated. Black is very thin on the left. Strike while the iron is hot.]
;B[lj];W[jh];B[cl];W[ch];B[bc]
(;W[eh]C[this situation seemed to be promising to me. 3 weak groups and enough strengh to attack but somehow i failed.

DrPepper: Unfortunately, after B17 that group is irritatingly resiliant. The one-space jump is solid but black has both D6 and D12 to manage some sabaki in the area, regardless of what you do.]
;B[ef]C[DrPepper: E14 here tries to stay relevant but black playing C18 in reserve is there for his group. It is hard to attack easily. If you are going to, you'll have to start at B18.]

;B[al];W[eq];B[fp]C[DrPepper: A very heavy way of moving. This black group should have a hard time of it.]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[gn]TR[iq]C[maybe it would have been better to play around j3 first?

DrPepper: Indeed, we always want to remove a base first, no matter how small.]
;B[iq];W[jo]C[Is this a good move to attack?

DrPepper: H2 removes the eye at the bottom for sure. If you feel your J9 stones are strong enough, with O6 in the background it is worth trying to kill.]

(;W[de]C[I thought a trade would be the best choice to make use of the e12 group, was this an good idea?

DrPepper: You should use the E12 group to push black against by taking your profit in the corner. It's not obvious to me that black lives so easily, but you can take fine profit without trying to kill so hard.]

[qp][rp][sp][hq][gr][gs][hs]C[DrPepper: The score was very close. I hope you see that even though black's right side seems big, to get there he had to invest a great many stones. A two-stone handicap game is close to an even game. Very rarely is anything drastic required, other than an eye towards better efficiency. White's premature reduction play on the right could have gone poorly, but it ended up working out ok.]
