(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]VW[]C[octagon:  Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.  I'm mostly interested in the first half,
and where I lost the control of the game that I felt I had.  The second half is only
a good example of how many times kyu players can give the game to eachother and back

;B[cf];W[ee]C[reviewer: again jump out from J17 is better. B could play F14 to further strengthen  the left side. B three stones on the right could be easily handled. Since W lacks
the jump at J17 and no effective attacks could be carried out.];B[ed];W
[df];B[ce];W[eg]C[reviewer: W14 is more solid as well as not giving B sente at F15.]
;B[bh];W[bb]C[reviewer: WC18 seems wrong direction. Instead, jump out at J17 is still a good move
or W can play D11.];B[ci]C[reviewer: because W18, now the center W stones become the target of B's attack.]

play.];B[fq];W[ep];B[fp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[eq];W[dq];B[ip];W[gn]C[LB> I feel that I am leading by a considerable amount here, but either I'm wrong or I
make some mistakes...
reviewer: so far W indeed is leading. However, it's worry some to me that there is  no W's stone on the right. Hence if I were W, I would still fasten the belt and play  carefully on the right to ensure the advantage.]

;W[ng];B[mh];W[nh];B[mi];W[kg]C[octagon: I think it is around here (or earlier) that I fall behind.
reviewer: W should connect at N16 and aiming to attack B center group. L13 leave
B connect at N16 with no target to attack but leave W three stones near M16 weak.
I don't think W is falling behind here. W should continue play confidently. Felt  losing is even more severe than play to lose some time.]

reviewer: W S18 may kill the B. If B R19, W S17 kill B. If B S17, W R19 destroy  B's root. B has trouble to find two eyes.]
