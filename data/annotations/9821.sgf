C[Hello, I am Chris Dams and I will be your reviewer today.

A main strategical thing that you overlook is playing pincer moves against invading opponent stones. It is good to deny your opponent stones space on the side and chase them around a bit, hopefully while getting territory. You don't do this after both the white moves 54 and 78. In both cases pincering these stones would have been even more fun than usual because there was another weak group of the opponent.

Another principle that you seem to be violating quite a lot is not to touch things that you are attacking. This is explained quite well in the book 'Attack and Defense' by Ishida and Davies. The idea is that in many cases moves that touch the opponent are good for defense but moves that are near the opponent but do not touch his stones are good for offense.]

;B[qr]C[I believe this is a joseki?

I don't think this is a joseki. R3 would be more normal for Black in this position. Since R3 is a good move, it just seems that R2 is inefficient compared to it. White respons to it locally but that was not necessary either. White could have just taken some big point somewhere on the board and have been content that Black gave up a point or so by playing the inefficient move. In particular, White ends up giving up sente in this 'joseki' and that really is not a good idea.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]C[This move by White does not seem necessary and gives up sente for a small gain. That is not good.]
;B[cf]C[Is this the biggest move? Or should I have taken the middle up top at k16/k17?

It is a matter of taste. Personally, I would have gone with P16, but C14 looks okay too. K16 or K17 look a bit timid to me. Like you are not prepared to play the most severe move, but that may be a matter of taste as well. I am not sure what a dan level player might say about it.]

;W[ef];B[oj];W[ol];B[on];W[ml];B[pm]C[elephant eye, yes?

Sure, looks fine to me. You end up bringing White in a bit of trouble by cutting off some of his stones, so that is good.]

;B[ro];W[so];B[pn];W[rn];B[oo];W[qo]C[It does not make sense to defend this stone for White. If Black captures, white can always ensure life by playing S2.]

(;B[ki]C[It does not feel like this stone is doing all that much. I added some possible moves to this position that all have their own clear purpose. Of them, I like H14 best because you are reducing the biggest potential territory of White in that case.]
;W[lg]C[This is the problem with your previous move. It looks like it is extending your potential territory, but it is really not.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[ng];W[kq]
(;B[kp]C[I feel lke I shouldn't have connected here. Perhaps L5 would have been better? I avoided that because it could have created an elephant eye if white responded at M4.

I would have played J3 here. J3 does not allow White any eye space on the bottom. Next you can try to keep both weak groups separated and hunt them a bit, hopefully while acquiring some territory in the process. See variation. Your move violates two general principles. First, is to not touch what you are attacking and second is to not play too close to your own strength, i.e., your group in the lower right.]
;W[jp];B[lq]C[The black group looks stonger after M4 instead.]
;W[kr];B[ko];W[kl]
(;B[jm]C[I prefer K6 instead. Firstly, it makes sure your stones are connected, and, secondly, in defense it is nice to attach to the attacker stones, which is exactly what White does in his next move. See variation.]
;W[jl];B[io];W[ip]C[This is nice for White. He gets to touch your stone which helps him to create a space for himself on the bottom.]
;B[ho];W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[fq];W[hq];B[go]C[I don't think it is necessary to defend here. You could have played F2.]

;W[cn]
(;B[dk]C[Would E9 have been better? Or maybe E8 to block off the cetner white group from connecting?

I certainly like E9 better because it does not touch what you are attacking. This is another example of the general principle not to touch what you are attacking. Yet another move came to my mind though. Have a look at the variation. In any case Black should be able to keep the white group on the left side an the other weak white group separated because that really is not hard to do in any case and does keep White on his toes and very uncomfortable.]

(;B[ei]C[A very soft move by Black that allows White to live easily. Have a look at the variation. I am not 100% sure it would have necessarily killed White but why not make him sweat if you can?]

(;W[jo]C[Really? Is there anything bigger on the board than fighting for the life of the white group on the left? See variation for how to make this group live now.]
;B[jn];W[rr];B[pr];W[qs];B[gf];W[ge];B[he]C[Perhaps K15 would have been better?

I still think there is nothing bigger than the life or death of the white group on the left. Aside from that, let us grant that the white group on the left is alive, which is doubtful, but okay, and let us assume for fun that the weak white group in the center is dead. In that case it seems to me that Black is enjoying a lead of about 30 points. In that case it just does not seem wise to play risky moves and squeeze out every last point. Instead, play moves that simplify the postition, keep the weak white group in the center dead and enjoy a relatively safe way to victory. E.g., a simple move like H14 looks like it is doing that job quite well.]
;W[hf];B[gd]C[This was a mistake];W[fe];B[if]C[Well, this was a big mistake.]
;W[hg];B[gg]C[Probably shoud have atari'd the other way to protect the center.]

Actually, you should first have attempted to kill the white group in the left. The black group here is only in danger after White plays P7. In go we need to postpone moves to the last possible moment and calculate very hard in order to be sure we are not playing them before the last possible moment.]

In general it is better to first surround that eye-space before invading. Like I already showed earlier, I like B11 first better.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[bk];B[ak];W[aj];B[al];W[ch]C[White should have connected, and this group would have found life.

Well, you need to answer this white move, so nothing wrong with playing a forcing in between. For as long as Black cannot play C8 White is okay playing other moves. Of course, that assumes that he can calculate accurately what is exactly the point where C8 starts to be a move that works.]
