C[Hello,

In this game I played as White, against some unknown opponent. I could not find any satisfying plan during the game, so started to overplay but got cleanly crushed (all moves by my opponent look good to me).

I have exposed some of my thoughts during the game. Thanks a lot for any comments and pointers!

WOG: Hi,

There are a lot of things to learn from this game. Here are some particular points that are themes in your play:

Strategically, you need to coordinate your moves better.  That is, when you play something have a reason or plan for that move.  Sometimes, you play uncoordinated... play one move with one strategy in mind (or at least in action), then play the next set of moves with a different strategy/reason to them.  That's a kiss of death in the game of Go.  Try to coordinate your moves as best you can.  Reason: moves coordinated around a goal are more effective.  Disparate goals for your stones, on a board where you only get to play one move at a time, kills each move's effectiveness.

Symptom 1: Don't be tenuki happy!
- Tenuki is a cool thing to learn about Go.  "No, I don't have to follow my opponent around the board, I can control my own destiny and play where I want."  Empowering and true... to some extent.  
- Your problem is that you tenuki after making a somewhat significant investment.  While you may have wished you didn't start the investment in the first place, you can't just ditch it when it's going bad... worse things happen as a result!
- Uncle Remus says "You can't run from your problems.  There ain't no place that far."

Symptom 2: You have to follow through.  You have to follow through.  You have to follow through and take your medicine... it may taste bad, it may be sour and nasty, but until you take it, you're worse off until you have taken it.

Medicine: Learn the Four Questions Rule of Thumb:
- Where am I strong
- Where is the opponent strong
Play away from strength

- Where am I weak
- Where is the opponent weak
Play toward weakness

Ideal moves do all four.

Great Go games flow like water because the moves are all geared toward not hurting each other; they act sym-phonically.  They don't change keys mid-music. They don't go from impressionism to cubism from move to move.  

Throughout your Go, you dischord (sic) your moves.  Discord is bad strategically.  Discord hurts your previous plans.  Discord means you don't follow through.  Discord means you hurt your prior plans.  Discord means tenuki-ing when you shouldn't.  Just as you should not bail on your commitments in life, you should likewise not do so on the Go board.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp]C[WOG: Mirror Go!];B[qo];W[jq]C[WOG: Can also consider one to the right]
;B[df]C[I have never seen this approach. I chose to play territorially here.

WOG: This is a fine move.  Approaching low or high with the White corner stone at d4 makes for a good pincer attack.  Playing 7 here is nothing abnormal.]
;W[ce]C[WOG: One way to go...];B[cf];W[de];B[ef]
(;W[fc]C[WOG: Oops.  This is not joseki.  Ideally in this position, White can approach from the other side or go away.  Playing this way is overconcentrated and too low.  Maybe you're thinking about connecting your stones?

There's a set of rules for Go.  Read any of my old reviews, you'll see that one of the most important sets of rules is the Four Questions rule.  Where am I/Where is the opponent strong?  Where am I/Where is the opponent weak?  The guide/rule of thumb for play is: Play away from strength;  Play closer to weakness. 

Here, move 12 is playing too close to strength!];B[ck]C[WOG: Good extension for Black]
(;W[nc]C[I feel that the black stone at e14 is strong and already reduces the top area for white, so maybe going for o17 isn't so good. What is the best point for white here?

WOG: Your post-mortem is good, this move is wrong; however, your reason is not quite right.   The Black stone at e14 has some bearing on the side, but more importantly, you already have a low stone on this side at F17.  Investing more on this side is just the wrong way to go.

A different motif on the Four Questions.  What side already has a significant investment?  Play elsewhere if so.]
;B[nd]C[WOG: Black plays strong];W[md];B[mc]C[While I understand black o16, this is the first time I meet  black n17. My understanding is that black wants to sacrifice this stone and get a squeeze, so as to get a better influence.

WOG: Right.  Black is trying to give White the side that's no good.  The problem isn't this strange joseki, the problem is the initial play at o17.]
(;W[od]C[Is the wedge okay here? I feel that white o15, bulding influence, is a bit small for white (see variation).

WOG: Technically, I wouldn't call this a wedge, but that's a nit.  The move at o15 would be a terrible result for White, so good choice :)  See the other variation at p18]
;B[ne];W[oc];B[oe];W[lc]C[WOG: Hmmm... despite the urgency of this move from the side perspective, maybe q17 is still more pressing.]
(;B[mb]C[WOG: When Black plays here, Black gives up securing the corner... part of why White might want to consider playing at q17 instead of m17.  Don't get me wrong, this move is just fine for Black, but it is the bad side.]
;W[pc]C[Should I just descend at m18?

WOG: No, I think this is better IMHO if just for the sake of trying to destroy Black's plan to have you take the bad side.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qb];B[rc]
(;W[lb]C[WOG: I think you should keep going in the corner... Follow-through!  Otherwise, what was the point of r18?  Discord.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[rb]C[WOG: Ouch!  This move really hurts.  That's the symptom of not following through/discord]
;W[pb]
(;B[qa]C[WOG: Black protects in sente!  Terrible.  This is the pain of not following through/discord.]
;W[nb];B[kp]C[WOG: Black has capitalized on multiple mistakes.  The slow move up top at f17, the poor approach at o17, and the not as good follow-up after the cross cut at n17.  Black gets sente to sketch out a big moyo.  While it may be a little greedy, it is impressive.]
(;W[qj]C[I liked black l4, and thought I should not wait before invading black's moyo.

WOG: Responding to the shoulder hit is normal.  Tenuki-ing and playing 38 here is acting worried; however, this tenuki is better than your subsequent tenuki.]
(;B[jp]C[WOG: Might be better for Black to play up top and kill two birds with one stone]
(;W[qg]C[I thought black would pincer my stone, but he built more influence with k4, forcing my stones on the third line. So I made a forcing move before answering, so that I already have something like a base.

WOG: Good.  Need to take advantage of Black's missed opportunities.]
;B[rf]C[Black undermines the base while protecting; this is nice.

WOG: Black having to protect here is irritating to Black... hence the problem with Black's prior decision]
(;W[iq]C[WOG: You play here, but then decide to bail here...]
;B[ip]C[WOG: Maa... seems aji keshi to me.  Pressing White here to support an attack on the above White stones seems unnecessary.  Not clear this press is needed to attack the White stones; therefore, this pressing should be kept in reserve.]
(;W[qm]C[I hesitated a lot here. H3 or H4 look like normal moves, but black r8 looks very dangerous for white. I eventually considered that making a base on the right side was urgent.

WOG: Discord.  Right to hesitate giving up more stones on the bottom to gain this move... The question is, did the Black move at 43 make the attack so much better?  I don't think so.  While this is a good move to help your stones on the right, their plight doesn't the whole board make. Discord.

Trading one burden for another doesn't decrease your burdens.

See variation for a different path.

Also, it's not respecting that Black's deepening a commitment to something that is sort of aji keshi. Black is essentially saying that pressing at j4 is necessary to attack.  Is it?  I don't think so.  If not, then the move is aji keshi.  If it is aji keshi, then allowing the opponent to press at j4 only helps you.  See?

Follow through, follow through...];B[hq]C[WOG: OUCH!!! (I'm starting to run out of ways to punctuate the seriousness of this pain)

Another way to think of this is from the perspective of the opponent.  What is the opponent's best move?  "Hane the head of two stones!  Perfect."

Don't give your opponent perfect moves.

Symptom of uncoordinated-ness/discord between your strategy/stones.]
(;W[cn]C[Crawling on the second line to live looked a bit pessimistic, so I preferred to form a shimari in the corner, to see how the game would develop before using the stone white stones.

WOG: This sort of discord is bordering on dishonor.

Ugh, the problem is that Black will eat these two white stones in one move!  You gained a few points on the right side with the move at r7, but then give up more points than gained to lose the stones at j3/k3.

Crawling to the second line is the medicine you have to take for playing at r7.  It's like you want to tenuki away the self-inflicted pain.  You invest in the j3-k3 stones, then you just go away like this with move 46 at c6?  Invest, invest, tenuki is not the best.  If you've committed to something, you need to follow-through.  Just because of an earlier mistake in the investment (r7), you can't just walk away and 46 the stones.

Discord! Discord!];B[hr]C[WOG: Like so.  Huge];W[dr]C[WOG: Ouch!  In gote?!  Black eats the two stones in sente?!  The price of discord.]
;B[rg]C[WOG: a White move here may have helped r10/r13 more than r7.]
(;W[nq]LB[dj:B][om:A]C[I did not know what to do here. I considered A and B during the game, but was not satisfied with the direction. Eventually I went for o3, to see how my opponent would react. What is the best move for white here?

WOG: This invasion is too deep.  Admittedly, White is behind now and has to play catch up Go, but this is too deep. 

Not sure what B would have accomplished.  A might be OK, but you are behind.  You can probe instead of invade, at like q2 or something... but even then, it may be too late to probe this deep]
(;B[lq]C[WOG: Black's a bit chicken]
(;W[ro]C[WOG: Not reallly helping the stone at o3.  Discord.]
;B[rp];W[po];B[qp]
(;W[om]C[White q7 looks a bit thin. I think that q6 may be a better shape.

WOG: Q7 is better shape locally, but considering the stone at o3, Q7 doesn't really help.  But, then again, the stone at p7 doesn't really help either.  

Strategically, what's the point of the stone here? Are you ditching the stone at o3 and helping the right side stones?  Always have a reason for your moves.   If just helping the side, consider r6.]
;B[pn];W[on]C[WOG: Again, strategically, what was the point of the move at p7? If it was to help the right side, why are you now trying to help the stone at o3.  Coordinating your moves is important!  Having your moves uncoordinated - one strategy here, one strategy there - is no help at all.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[pp];W[mn]C[WOG: Good move for the stone at o3, not so great for the right side.]
;B[pm]
(;W[ql]C[I did not want to block at q8, and give black a splitting attack.

WOG: Never let the opponent split you like this!  Imagine a little bit of water coming through a dam...  never (99.9% of the time) offer the opponent a breach like this.  Another symptom of discord]
;B[pl]C[WOG: Now, Black has no weak stones and you're still split]
;W[rn];B[pk];W[ri]C[My group on the right is now safe, but I have one weak group. Usually, I would still prefer white here (as it seems to be ahead in territory), but my feeling is that black has a superior position.

WOG: The group on the right is not completely alive yet.  Black has the superior position, despite some slow moves at like m3, because you have a big weak White group amidst two very strong Black groups.

The idea of "now I have a safe group" is the antithesis of good Go.  Everything needs to be treated like an option.  There's a time to live, a time to die, a time to exchange (seemingly live groups for a strategic advantage over the whole board), ... I can hear the Byrds now ("turn, turn, turn...").]
;B[lm]C[I did not expect this, which I find quite severe.

WOG: Hence, why your evaluation of White being ahead was wrong :)  This is very bad for White.]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[ll]C[WOG: Bold, but doesn't work];B[mk]C[WOG: White's trapped]
;W[kn];B[km];W[jm];B[kl];W[ko]C[At this point, I thought it'd be better to give black the n4 peep, so that my group could escape to the left (variation proposed).

WOG: White's still trapped]
(;B[jn]C[Black decided to cut; I did not expect this move.

WOG: Yep];W[jo];B[in];W[io];B[ho]C[WOG: Bingo.  White's lost]
;W[hn]C[WOG: Dead stones moving?];B[im];W[go];B[hp];W[jl];B[kk]
;W[jk];B[hl];W[gm];B[jj]C[WOG: ugh];W[ik]C[The situation is bad for white. I think I should have cut immediately at l10.

WOG: Uh, resign is always admirable];B[gk];W[ij];B[ii];W[lr]
C[WOG: Now you're going to live?];B[mr];W[mq]
(;B[kr]C[WOG: oops.  Black gives White life... not that White didn't sacrifice a ton to get life with the loss of the five White stones in the middle]
;W[lp];B[ls];W[kj];B[ji];W[ln];B[lk];W[mo]C[At this point of the game, I counted around 70 for black, 60 for white. Black has more potential and has sente, so the game is probably difficult for white.

WOG: Your count for White seems close, but Black has more

White: 
Upper left, White has like 27, plus half of the middle of j17 area - 6, plus 5 with the capture of n18 = 38?

Lower left, White has 20 max.  3 in the middle.  6 on the right side.  

38+20+3+6 = 67 plus komi if an even game?

Black: There's almost 80 just in the middle.  Plus corners and side that's an insurmountable advantage at this stage.  Moreover, the position on the right side is not completely sure yet for White]
(;B[dm]C[WOG: Not the biggest, but at this point, it doesn't matter... Black is far ahead]
;W[ge]C[I understood black d7, but thought that getting g15 was bigger.

WOG: Yes, but might want to consider the right side too... consider the variation for move 109]
;B[dn];W[co]C[Maybe I should have perservered, with g13?

WOG: No!!  G13 would mean disaster for the lower left.];B[gf]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[hg]C[I think I should have made shape with j15 here. That push only helps black.]
;B[hh];W[bl];B[bk];W[cl];B[dl];W[eo]C[WOG: Right, if you want to save these stones, you have to do something...]

(;W[qk]C[I think this move is not necessary, and that I should have played something around b15 (variation proposed).
