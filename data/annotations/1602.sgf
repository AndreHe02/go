C[I used Black in this game.
I have a problem with the 61th move.
I don't know Q17 or N14 which is better.
Because N14 can keep attack the white O 14 group, but the right upper corner  will probably have some trouble and lead a complex fight, so, at the end,  probably, I would lose my advantage.

However, if I played Q17, I could get a huge territory but  my M12 group  would be attacked by M14.( The opponent made a big mistake here by playing  G17.) It was not too severely for me because the white still had a weak R6  group.
Therefore, I showed my 3 variations and hope you can give me some  suggestion.]

C[Per: This move look like an overplay. Letting black play M6 is very painfull.]

LB[oq:a][pl:b]C[Per: Black could also play either (a) or (b) to make points while attacking.]
;W[pl];B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[jp];B[ip]LB[ho:a]C[Per: There is a proverb saying "don't make contact moves when attacking". Playing (a) is a faster way to attack.]

;W[oe];B[pg];W[of]LB[nf:a]C[Per: This move is bad shape (a) is better.]
;B[hl];W[ij];B[jj];W[hk]C[Per: Let's try to make a status here.

White only has safe territorie in the bottom left corner. The H9 group is out and is difficult to attack now. The H8 group is still weak.
Black has safe territorie at the bottom a little more than whites in the corner. On the right side black has at least 20 points.
In the center black also has a weak group.

Status is black has a clear lead and should play solid moves preventing an white attack. In this case N14 does both. It attacks white and secures the black center group.
White will be to busy defending the H8 group to invade the corner.]

Fortunally black can afford to play simple. (see variation)]
