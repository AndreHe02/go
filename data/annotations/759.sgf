[pd:A][dp:A][dd:A]C[A first move in a corner is preferred. On a 4-4 point, marked
with A. Or a 3-4 point marked with B are probably best.];W[pp]
C[Very good.];B[jk]C[Again from the start Black is trying to occupy the center. This
is difficult. Gaining a corner is much easier, you already have
2 "walls" (the sides of the board) to work with.];W[pd]C[Again, this is good.]
;B[kj];W[dp];B[ij];W[dd]C[A very strange opening for Black. I have never seen this before.
This shape that Black has made is called a "Death Star", the
Japanese word is ponnuki. I have read that this position is good
for training. Black must use his influence in the center to make
territory. And White should defend his corners.];B[cc];W[cd]
C[This is a good response to the Black invasion.];B[dc]C[Again this is joseki (standard opening moves).]
;W[ec]C[Good.];B[eb];W[fb];B[fc]
(;W[fd]LB[ed:A]C[I believe this was a mistake. Think about connecting at A. Lets
play out a variation of that.];B[ed]TR[cd][dd][fd][fb]C[Now all the marked White stones are disconnected and very weak.]
;W[ee];B[ec]
(;W[gb]TR[fb]C[I think efforts to save the marked stone will ultimately fail.
You might consider defending the other stones in this position.
Lets explore a variation.];B[de]C[Black makes this cut, it is a very strong attack. White is in
a lot of trouble here.];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[cg];W[dg];B[ef]

;B[di];W[cj];B[eh]TR[dh][dg][bg][af][be][cf][ce][cd][dd]C[The marked White stones are dead at this point.  The other group
is weak but may be saved. Lets try to save it.]
(;W[jd]C[This looks like a good, strong move.];B[gc]C[The natural Black response, be careful White is now in atari.
Do you see it?];W[hc]LB[hd:B][he:A]TR[ge]C[The simple capture of the marked Black stone at A would have
been a good move or extending at B should work also.];B[hd]
C[Devastating for White.];W[ic]C[This is a good move. This strenghtens the marked White stones
and helps to secure a lot of territory along the top.];B[eg]
C[This is an unneccessary move by Black. Those 2 White stones were
dead with no hope of rescue.];W[dj]C[This is OK. It helps to secure some territory along the left
side, but I would have grabbed one of the remaining star points.]
;B[ej];W[dl]C[Very nice. White now looks strong on the lower left side and
corner.];B[dn]C[Black makes a bold invasion.];W[cn]C[The natural response. I also believe it to be the correct response.]
;B[cm];W[dm]TR[dn][cm]C[Very good. Don't be afraid to attack the marked Black stones.
Sometimes the best defense is a strong offense.];B[co]C[The natural Black move.]
;W[bn]C[The only move. Very good.];B[do]C[Black has no choice, he must connect. The next White move is
critical. The marked White stone is now under attack. Black is
threatening to take over the entire corner.];W[cp]C[I like this move.]
;B[bo];W[bm]LB[an:A]C[This is OK. I probably would have just played down at A.]
;B[ep]C[Now the corner is in trouble.];W[eq]C[This is the obvious response.]
;B[dq]C[Wow, Black is bold.];W[cq]C[Of course.];B[dr];W[eo]
C[Nice.];B[cr];W[fp]TR[cr][dr][dq]C[Very well played. White defended the invasion with strong moves.
The marked Black stones may survive. But will not gain many points
since they are so low.];B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[ep];B[en]C[Ah, Black may pull his stones out of the fire.]

(;W[fl]LB[br:A]TR[bo][co][do][dn][en]C[I'm not so sure about this move. I guess White is trying to surround
the marked Black stones and move out into the center.];B[fn]
;W[hp]C[This seems like a good move. Black is catching up.]
;B[er];W[fr]C[Natural response.];B[gq]TR[eq][eo][fp][ep][dp]

trying to cut off the marked White stones.];W[gr]LB[fq:B][gp:A]

C[This series of moves is not good for White. You are playing moves
that is forcing Black into your corner. Lets go back and look
at a way to force him the other direction.];W[mf];B[ne];W[od]

(;W[of]TR[jh][ih][ig][gf][hf][ie][kd][jd][jc][jb][kb][ka][ic]
[hc][hb][gb][fb][ga]C[This seems like a reasonable move to help defend the right side.
But you are in danger of losing the marked stones. Lets try to
save them. Do you see that they are in trouble. They do not have
enough room to make another eye towards the center. And the 2
black stones are placed properly to make it impossible for White
to make 2 eyes in that space.];B[lg]TR[jh][ih][ig][gf][hf][ie]
[jd][kd][ka][kb][jb][jc][ic][hc][hb][gb][fb][ga]C[With this move Black has defended against the move just discussed.
Now the marked White stones are dead.];W[nf];B[qj]LB[qg:A]C[Now Black makes a very solid move around the last star point.
Because of his strong position in the center this will be very
difficult to deal with.];W[qm]TR[pd][od][of][nf][mf][lf][le]
C[Even though this helps to secure territory in the corner, I think
a move around A would have been better. It may not seem like
it but the marked White stones are weak. I suggest trying to
make a base.];B[qf]C[See how Black jumps into that area.];W[qe]
;B[pf];W[oe];B[qc];W[qd];B[rc];W[pc]LB[oj:C][pg:B][mg:A]C[White has no eyes yet. This move does not really help the cause.
A move around A or B would probably be stronger. Or even C.]
;B[pb];W[pg]C[Good.];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pj];B[pk];W[qi]C[I know it seems like a strong move to push in like this, but
White is still struggling for eye space. This gives up sente,
or initiative. Watch how when Black makes his response, White
must responed to him. This then gives the initiative to Black.]
;B[ri]C[Atari, white must connect.];W[pi]C[Now Black can play where he wants to.]
;B[rk]C[A good move that has 2 purposes. It connects the Black stones
and threatens to encroach into Whites corner.];W[rm]TR[pj][qi]

White stones are very weak and Black has a chance to steal there
eye space and cut them off.];B[ok]C[See how Black is cutting those White stones off from the corner.
They must now fight for survival in the limited space they have,
not an easy task.];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[mg];W[mh]

possibility of making 1 around A. So he must make 2 by playing
at the 2 marked points.];W[lh]
(;B[kg]C[I don't like this move for Black. He should push in and steal
Whites eye space.]
(;W[li]C[This is not good. Black has enough liberties to win the ensuing
race, so he does not need to connect at A. Lets take a look.]

look.];W[lj];B[lk];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[ql]

in jeopardy?];W[lm]C[Now you must run like this and Black can continue to sneak into
the corner.];B[qn]C[This move is very strong for Black the marked White stones are
very weak and will probably die. And with them White loses a
lot of corner territory. See how trying to save those stones
led to this. Plus the center stones are also weak.];W[rn];B[qo]
