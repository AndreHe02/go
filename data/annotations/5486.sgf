AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer,

In this game I had black in a 2 stone handicap game. I won the game by resignation. However, I struggled many times trying to find the best answer to my opponents moves.

With this game, I am hoping you can help me with positional judgment and the correct direction of play. I would also appreciate any hints that would allow me to attack my opponent more severely.

I have included my comments at different points in the game to let you know my thinking.

Thank you,

Philippe


Rill : I will mark all my comments with R:

R : you've played a good game, keeping the advantage from the beginning to the end.
Just remember to avoid contact when you want to attack your opponent's stones.
Let me know if you still have some questions

Vincent];W[dd];B[pp];W[nc];B[pj];W[qc]LB[qf:A][pg:B]C[R: I don't think invading the san-san is the best move. White should have considered a double approach at A or B]
;B[qd]C[R: Good.];W[pc];B[od];W[nd];B[oc]C[R: Maybe playing the hane at O15 would be better. You can always look for ways to exploit this weakness later.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]
(;W[nf]LB[ld:A][kf:E][lf:C][nf:B][kg:F][lg:D]C[This move by white does not strike me as best.

I expected more a continuation such as White A(M16), black B (O14), white C (M14), black D (M13), White E (L14) to black F (L13)...


R : I agree. This move is strange with the threat of the double atari at N16 left after. I would have prefered playing N16.
M16 leaves too many forcing moves for black];B[oe]
(;W[lc]LB[ld:A]C[Again I would have played white A (M16)


R : N16 is still playable too]
(;B[le]C[R : Why not N16 ?]
(;W[mc]C[This move puzzled me

R : It's better than connecting];B[dj]C[I felt I had gotten the better of the exchange in the corner and played tenuki.

R : The exchange was definitely better for black. Tenuki is good.]
;W[mg];B[md];W[ng];B[pg]C[White can cause problems with his 3 stones, but I felt it would be up to me to attack his weak group.

R : I prefer M13 for black. Or tenuki (K4 feels nice) Since your group is out in the center, it doesn't have much to fear for the moment.]
;W[np];B[jq];W[gp]C[R : Kinda strange for white. R6 or Q3 feels better]
;B[pn];W[pq]
(;B[mq]C[R : Why not blocking with R3 ?];W[qq];B[qp];W[dm]C[White has spread his stones well...

R : yes but his stones are divided. White is accumulating weak groups]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[nq]C[My aim was to let white take the corner while I stenghtened my stones on the bottom and right.

R : yes, it is a urgent point.];W[or];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
;B[qn]C[I was fairly happy with this result for the bottom and right stones.]
;W[nj]C[Now my questions begin...

I was not sure how best to attack my opponent. Any HINTS are welcomed!]
;B[lg]C[R : this move is good but maybe B16 or E14 was more urgent. White cannot do much with his stones in O13.
You also have O2 which is sente.];W[bd]C[Does not seem urgent to me for white to play there...

R: this move is big and threaten C12.];B[en]
(;W[ck]C[R : This move is bad for white. It reinforce black's shape while giving white a defavorable position]
;B[cj]C[R : Good answer]
(;W[dk]C[R : This move make white's stones heavy. Jumping with F8 feels better]
;B[dn]
(;W[cm]C[R : jumping is still better];B[nk]LB[li:B][lj:A][ol:C]
C[R : Avoid contact when attacking
A or B is good enough if you want to attack O13-O10. C is good is you want to solidify your territory (a little slow at this time]
;W[lj];B[mk];W[cn]
(;B[eq]C[I will have to give up the corner but I am hoping to get compensation in the bottom left...

R : you could have played C5];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[dr]
;B[bq];W[br];B[ap];W[er];B[fr];W[dq]
(;B[fp];W[gq];B[fq];W[ar]C[White takes the corner but at least I have him sealed in.

Now to attack in the bottom left...


R : G6 or F8 feels nice]
(;B[go]C[R : Same as before, avoid contact.];W[ip];B[jp];W[io]

(;B[jo]C[R : Avoid pushing from behind. Jumping ahead with L6 is better]
;W[in];B[iq];W[hp];B[km]C[I did not get much in the bottom left but did very well in the bottom right.

I am wondering if I could have done better?


R : see the suggestions and variations];W[gn]C[This move was hard on me]

(;B[gr]C[I played it safe for my group

R : That's okay but I would have prefered to continue the fight]
;W[lh];B[kg];W[jj]C[I am wondering how I can attack white's group...

R : Begin with dividing. J8 by exemple.];B[kh];W[mi]LB[ef:B]
[kk:A]C[I hesitated a lot between A (L9) and B (E14).

I finally opted for A to keep the pressure and hoped white would not play B.


R : L9 doesn't get you much but white can't really ignore it either so I guess it's okay. But E14 is much more important (white C12 is dangerous for your group)]
;B[kk]
(;W[kj];B[ef]C[My attacks on white's group were not very severe but I managed to keep the initiative.]
;W[ek];B[fi];W[hk];B[id]C[The last big point in my view...


R : yes];W[hh]C[Not sure what white had in mind with this move?


R : Can't help you :)];B[ld];W[ic];B[kc];W[kb]MA[lc][mc][nc]
[nd]C[A mistake by white as his 4 marked stones (M17...O16) have 2 liberties.


R : yes, obviously];B[nr]C[I thought I should play my forcing moves while I could.
