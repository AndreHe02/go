C[Xris: Hi, I would like to know where in the game I have to improve. I didnt make any "obvious" mistakes as far as I can see, so the reason must lie in my style of play.

Thank you very much for reviewing.

Xris

Bram: Indeed no obvious mistakes. Very nice game... I've been studying this game for a week now, and I hope my comments will be usefull.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[qe];W[jc];B[fc]C[Xris: Really whites move did not threat a lot, so I decided to just save another corner. His two corners are still open for approach or invasion and he is creating a base in gote so ... I was quite pleased so far.


Bram: Yes you did the right thing here. I've seen this sequence before in a 4kyu game.]
;W[mc];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq]
(;B[jq]LB[mp:A][np:B]C[Xris: I am not sure if this was the right approach for black. b13 is quite far away and I think the hane missed its efficiency by me not doing something else with it.

Bram: Yes normally you should add an extra stone at (A)N4 or (B)O4 before making an extension. it is too easy for white to play (B)O4.

If you are interested take a look at the variations:  I included some joseki sequences for this situation. In short: A is risky for both players. B is safe.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[fq]C[Xris: Whites push on the second line was not very important I think...

Bram: Yes and No ... Maybe not that big but you should reply to it. white O4 still looks big for white ... M3 would be good for white too. So If I played black I would have played m3. (Makes both O4 and M3 impossible)]

(;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cj];W[qn];B[qi]TR[qg][hq]C[Bram: It's not that bad but personally I think I would never play a move like R11. I don't feel confident when playing with a gap like this. R12 would be a lot better. Less aji. 
If white would play R9 at this point he would be threathening to play R13. White would play R9 in sente.


Same goes for the the bottum H3 spot. I would feel really uncomfortable and would play a move like F5 or E4 really early.]

(;W[ce]C[Xris: I think this not the best way to invade for white but I could only "punish" him because he made a mistake lateron.

Bram: I'm not sure about it. What you did looks reasonable.]

(;B[de]C[Xris: Generally I think the hane here is quite strong but its inviting him to extend down and weaken the single black stone, I think. Would the pincer have been better?]
;W[cf];B[df];W[bd];B[cc];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg]
(;W[bj];B[bh];W[bi];B[bf];W[ah];B[be];W[ck]C[If you play it like this your next move should be J16. You were about to give white territory at the left ... so you should get a moyo in return for that.]

(;B[ql];W[gc]
(;B[fd]C[Would a hane have been better here? Later on he is getting quite some terretory on that side so maybe a hane would have put more pressure on him?

Yes indeed you put too little pressure on him];W[gd];B[lr];W[ph]
;B[qh];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg];B[rg];W[mg];B[ge];W[he];B[gf]C[Bram: Again too easy for white i think. You can go for H14 in my oppinion]

(;B[di]SQ[om][fo]C[Xris: Too small?


Bram: Yes maybe a little too small, but doesn't look that bad, but maybe P7 or especially F5 are bigger.
See variation to see what happens if white plays H4 ...]

;B[ff];W[om];C[tomomo (W:O): 81.5 to Xris (B:#): 81.0
Game is completed.


Xris: Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

Bram: Nice game, very high level. Hard to believe it's from a 20k - 21k game. And it was very hard to review for me. Maybe I'm not strong enough to comment this game. But I hope my review was useful in some ways. The main thing I can say about this game is ... "you had some nice chances to build big moyo's but you didn't take them".]

however when black would have played N4 instead of O4
L4 and K4 become possible because black will have more aji.

That's why I personally mostly play O4]
