Hi im black in this game and I play on kgs.
I would like some advice on the opening and middle game
please. Thanks for reviewing :)

Hi, I'm Tom.  I play as greendemon on KGS, so if you ever want to talk or play, you know where to find me =).

Overall, your play seems pretty strong.  I encourage you to think globally and look for big open spaces to play in.  The left side has very few stones played in it until around turn 55.  this is too late.  In general, try not to clump your stones to close together, and I think your play will improve.]

Q10 after but then he invaded and i made mistakes xD

Probably better to play F17 or D2.  In particular, D2 is good for you because White C3 makes C6 seem too close.]
;W[qn];B[ql]C[Pincer was right?

Sure.];W[qq];B[qp]C[Better here to go the other way; play C3 and support your K3 stone.]

(;W[rq];B[qo];W[ln];B[mm];W[qf];B[qh];W[qd];B[qc]C[This is a good move.  It protects your side and attacks white.]

;W[mh];B[jd]C[I played but now i feel i should of played f17 xD

Yes, this is a little tight I think.  f17 is better.  You probably should have played there even earlier.]
;W[hc];B[ch]C[Good Idea, but I think 4th line is a little stronger here.  Consider D14.  It gives you  better escape. to your top stones, and threatens a c17 invasion.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[cf]
(;B[ej]C[Too far.  invites a split.  See variations.  Simple D11 is safer and stronger.]

(;W[df];B[eg];W[ci];B[ge]C[B12 is a great play now.  It splits off the two white stones.]
;W[lm];B[fo]C[It's still better to play D2.  It extends your territory and threatens white's corner.]
;W[ml];B[nl]C[B12 is a big move because is splits white and attacks C10.  D2 is a big move because it threatens to take whites corner and builds your moyo.  This move R8 seems very small so me; you only defend what's already yours.]

until end

This is a tricky read.  If you play B4 or B5, it definitely lives.  I show a few variations.  If white attacks, it becomes a question of escape.  The smartest thing is to play B5 to be safe.]
