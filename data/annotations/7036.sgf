C[bingoboy: hi];B[pd]C[alfa: Hi!];W[cp]C[I was Black in this game, played on IGS.

I finished the game 20 points behind but I felt I was behind the whole game.

I wonder where I made bad moves.
I will point out where I think I made bad moves.

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp];W[cf];B[cj]C[b: The opening was good so far. But this move was not so good. 
You do not need to destroy every frame work your oponent builds. 
Here are some reasons why this move is bad:

1) The left hand side of white is low (mainly third line). He will not build a huge framework there, just a low one. in partcular your stones E4 F4 will always hinder white to extend this framework very far.

2) your stone on C10 has no good extension. It will become a burden on you.

3) the upper side is important. If white plays on K16 or yourself makes a big diference.

You best move would probably be K17. Also Q10 (building a san ren sei) is far better then your C10.]
;W[qg];B[qj];W[rd];B[qe]C[b: Not so good. you make white more stable. R15 does not help you as much as white S15 helps white.

Leave this open. depending on the development you might later want to play S17 or S15 instead. Even if you later decide you really want to play R15 you can still do it later. white will always answer S15 or S14. 

white has to worry less if you fix a weak white position as you are doing here. this is a helping move or thank you move. You are helping white.  

A better move would be something like L17.
Or you play R17 first  an then L17.];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[pg]
C[b: Ok now i understand your idea. so you can partly forget what I wrote 4 moves earlier. Still this is not a good plan as the thickness you are building faces a strong white position. This is the wrong direction. 
You would rather want a black wall facing downwards to your moyo.
But as that was not possible you better build no wall at all.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[qd]C[b: bad form. The empty triangle will come back to hount you later.
Better K16 or R12.
You can later even treat stones like R15 and R14 lightly. As the white position is stable you can consider them as forcing moves now.]
;W[qc]C[b: white takes a liberty imediately];B[ob]C[b: a white cut at P16 is very unpleasent. Only so because of your R16]
;W[mq]C[b: Not so good either. Q12 or P16  or H17 would be good.]
;B[oq]C[b: good!];W[mo];B[lp];W[mp];B[on]C[b: better Q6. It attacks as well as your P6, but your right side will be more solid.]
;W[jr]
(;B[jq]C[b: you invite white to push further. If you have no plan against that do not play here.]
;W[ir]
(;B[lq]C[b: L2 instead of M3 is probably better: it cuts.];W[lr]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[fr];W[er]C[b: an endgame move. Not correct.]
;B[fd]C[b: To close.
Also there is no good follow up to attack the corner. G17 is better.
If you play a move like F16 do think already about possible follow up moves.]
;W[jd]C[b: white asks you what follow up move you have prepared.]
;B[dd]C[I did not want to press at H16 or H17 because of the cut at P16.

b: Yes, the cut at P16 is very unpleasant. What would you do after it anyway? Probably giving away some stones with O16, O15. 
Pressing with H17 is no good as this is no good extension from F16.
Your move D16 achieves little, it mainly helps your oponent.
Its hard to find a good move.
I think I would have played F13];W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[ec];W[db]
C[Already White has secured lots of point (3 corners).

Maybe better than black K14 9next move),  it is to press the white N5 group with black L6 (or even M6 ?).

That way black secures territory on the left and build wall in the center while white escapes.

The black wall would then work well with the black F4 group.

K14 could then come as an extension of this wall in the center.

Does this reasoning make sense for black or are there urgent points to play ?

b: You are right: attacking the white group around N2 is best. You are behind in territory but far ahead in influence. So you need to attack! 

The direction you propose is also the right one: you should attack from the direction of your weak group. you will not get much territory there, as white J2 is in place, but you will gain strength and later you might gain territory on the right side and you might get in the move K14 or K13.

Now the question comes which is the best point: M6 or L6 or what?

M6 is bad. Attacking works best from the distance. If you put the stones to close (like M6) this stone will come itself undere attack and you have to worry about it later. L6 is better. But the best point is L7. This has the right distance to your stones K4 and M4.]

(;B[hc]C[b: wrong direction. your stones to the left are out in the open. They dont need a base. the music plays in the center now.]

;W[mj]
(;B[pj]C[b: Not good. To slow.  It is more important to keep the white groups seperated. you need to attack them! For white it woulnt make sense to attack here. white would achieve something on the right side, but would heart his center to much. As white would not attack you dont need to defend.]
;W[nb];B[nc];W[oa]C[b: end game sequence. To early for that. Now attack!]

(;B[mb]C[b: NO! thats am endgame move! Avoid making endgame moves in the middle game.]

(;W[na]C[b: No! thats an endgame move.];B[pa];W[qa];B[ma]C[no! endgame move!]

(;W[pa]C[b: No! very small.
Luckily for black white answered all those moves and didnt take the initative in the center.]

(;B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]
(;B[ql]C[b: sad.  you missed your chance.];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn]
;B[qn];W[po]C[I did not dare P5 instead of R5 (next move) because I was not sure if I could kill N2 before being killed (Q4) and keep the R6 group alive.

b: your situation is desperate, so you should take risks now. But: Because of white G4 you have hardly any chance to kill N2. So your ove R5 is ok. As I said you missed your chance earlier by forgetting the option to jump. As I read in one Go-book in a chapter called "The stones go walking": if black and white are walking parallel to each other like in the last 10 moves, the game becomes a struggle to get ahead of the oponent. But you didnt even try. You just followed behind. look for options to get ahead by jumping.]
;B[qo];W[oo];B[nn]C[b: careful! defending this stone is Gote! This stone is not important. No cutting stone! Avoiding unimportant Gote moves like that brings you at least two stones in playing strength. It is Gote, as white in turn can defend his cutting point in sente by playing P4.]
;W[op];B[pq]C[b: white has got the initative now and can easily win the game.]
;W[ck];B[fn]
(;W[gn]C[b: helps black. I do not see what it defends against.]
;B[go];W[fm];B[en];W[dk]C[Black is too much behind now and I don't see how to kill the long white group.

b: you are right.];B[em];W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[dp];W[cq];B[cm]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dn];W[dl];B[co]C[b: very good!
end of my comments.

General comments about your playing style: 
1) Sometimes your stones move to slowly forward. Look for ways to improve your speed.
2) Your opening is fine. But sometimes you should leave something to your oponent and look for your own chances of building frameworks.
3) Try to avoid Gote moves which do not bring much profit or stability. Try to avoid endgame move to early in the middle game.
4) If you have to connect try to find all different moves which connect and choose the best of those.]
