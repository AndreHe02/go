C[Hello, my name is Jérémie and I will be your reviewer today. I am 6k on IGS and go by the name "Piou" there. I will try my best to show you were you could have played differently and show you some variation for those moves.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ck]C[This white move is very surprising because it has little no no influence on the top-left corner. The best idea now would be to put a lot of pressure on the top white stone.]

SQ[nn][oo][op][nq][oq][pq]C[This is the key moment of the game. White has now three weak groups. That is way more than he can handle. Black must attack those.

Therefore, it is most important for black to play very solid moves that keep white separated. Hence black must not leave a single cutting point if it is not absolutely necessary.]

Result: W+20.5

---

So in the end white wins by 20 points. Here are the three key points you should focus on :

* 16 points for the southern white group only. These groups should not have lived and had they lived they should have made two eyes at most. You were way too kind there. Almost all of white's victory points were earned here.

* You must be more pressing in keeping white groups seperated. Go is about cutting and connecting, that is cutting the opponent and connecting your stones. Until the Yose, this is the most important thing in the game, way ahead territory and points.

* You left the top-right corner opened for too long. Once there were no weak groups on the board any more (which means big yose has begun) the 3-3 move was by far the biggest, most urgent move

So here goes. I hope my comments helped you understand what your key mistakes were. If you have any other question you can contact me by email or on IGS/KGS (I have the name "Piou" on both servers).]
