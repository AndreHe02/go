C[Dear Reviewer,

In this game I have lost very badly. I am playing WHITE.
I injected few comments along the way to let you know what I was thinking and if I had any questions.

Thank you for taking time to review this game.

-PETE

Hello, Pete, this is Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

In a game of Go it is essential not to have weak groups. In this review I am going to show, where you violate this principle and get into trouble.]

(;B[ed]
(;W[hc]LB[gc:B][hd:A]C[PETE: I felt that this pincer was OK move because of the stone at Q16.

Hon: The direction is okay. The usual pincers are A or B.];B[ce]
C[PETE: unfortunately it seems Black came up with the right idea - instead of jumping out at say E14, Black attached here and is ready to form a wall facing the lower side (which is also positioned for influence). I did not feel good about this.

Hon: It is a normal idea for him to go for the left side, but it does not mean that it is bad for you! There are a lot of fuseki variations which have black building up a formation on the side like this. 

If you see the examples in the variations of move 4, you may think, that all of them look better for black, but the shapes are very normal, and white has good chances to compensate. He's got komi after all. Black may get a moyo, but you solidify the corner or even get solid points there. The only thing you got to watch out for is that you don't miss the moment to neutralize his influence, then you won't fall behind.]
(;W[ec]C[PETE: with this move I am hoping to complicate things so that I can eventually exploit some weak points. I am ready to give up the corner to get influence. Would that be a good trade off?

Hon: Attaching is a defensive move. Black will end up controlling the influence. Also your idea to complicate the position is not natural. That is all defensive measures. But the upper side is a place where you are strong! In places where you got more stones than the opponent, you want to increase pressure on him and attack. While he runs, you patiently make points. The weaker side (locally) has to go for quick settling or complications, not the stronger side!]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[bd];W[cc];B[fd];W[fc]C[PETE: too slow? Avoiding this move seems dangerous.

Hon: The move is correct. You must not allow your positions getting split. Stay connected!]
(;B[dk]C[PETE: ouch!

Hon: It's not too much of an "ouch". It is just another moyo on the left side, like in the opening patterns I showed you.

Now is the moment to reduce his influence.]
(;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq]
(;W[iq]C[Hon: Mistake!]
(;B[kq];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]LB[ci:B][cq:A]TR[gd][de][cf]
[ef]C[PETE: can't say I feel good about the outcome of all this -- but I was up against 3 stones and a wall when I played at J3 .. so perhaps the outcome is OK?

Hon: Yes, locally this is an okay result for you. you can still invade at A, or you can aim at invading somewhere around B, using the weakpoints at the marked spots.]
(;W[ci]C[PETE: I figured that I cannot let Black have all of the left side because the game would be over.

Hon: You panic too early when you see an opponent's moyo. First of all it is imperative not to have a weak group.]
;B[cj]
(;W[df]C[Hon: I see what you are doing, and the idea is right. You want to exploit his weak points to strengthen yourself, and that is good, but you are not choosing the best way. 

There is a go proverb - do not peep where you can cut. 

It means that you should not erase the potential of being able to cut later.]
;B[cf];W[dg];B[de];W[ei];B[bi]
(;W[ch];B[bh]
(;W[gf];B[hd];W[id]C[PETE: the other move I considered was G17.

Hon: I like this one better. Even better would be J17. You should not leave weak points, so that you can find time very soon to defend the center group. If he can go on pressing on your top, the center group gets weaker, or you will have to take losses at the top.]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[gd];W[ic]C[PETE: I'm starting to feel better about the position (now that a have a strong group facing the stone at Q16. I feel like I might be OK (as long as the group of 6 stones lives.

Hon: And the lower left. And lower right.];B[hf];W[hg];B[if]
;W[gi];B[ig];W[hh];B[ff];W[fg];B[ef];W[ji]C[PETE: this move seems a bit slow to me now. I should have probably played around R9 ?

Hon: Way earlier.

Now you begin to feel, that you missed a move earlier. You are in the unpleasant situation to have to decide which side to defend first.]
;B[pf];W[pi]C[PETE: Here my thinking is: support the group to the left and try to extend from the bottom right group as well.

Hon: Good move!];B[mf]
(;W[md]C[PETE: I was hoping this would happen when I played Q11.

Hon: But you miss that the critical place is not the top right corner but the weak groups in the other places.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[qe];W[oc]C[PETE: Considered playing at Q17 as well but I was worried that might leave too much room below the stone at N16. This move also feels a bit slow and allows black to ..]
;B[qk]C[PETE: another ouch :) I have two groups to worry about now.

Hon: Yes, you're right. But that was the problem of your fuseki.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[ni];B[pl]
(;W[pm];B[rl]
(;W[qm]C[PETE: I hate this shape, and ..

Hon: Then you must not play Q7.];B[ri]C[PETE: black connects his two groups and is care-free for both of them now. I feel I went too easy on Black since the approach move at Q14.

Hon: Your groups were weaker than his, so since he is just patiently living on the 2nd line, I would rather say he's being too easy on you instead!]
;W[rm];B[qi]
(;W[pg];B[qg];W[og];B[rc]C[Hon: When black comes around here, that is way bigger than what you did around Q13. Your moves only solidified him, while even after them you still got moves like N8 or M11 to worry about.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pq];W[of];B[qb]C[PETE: I know corners are big but I feel like I cannot let Black continue to keep the sante. I want to go something bigger.

Hon: To allow this black move is terrible for you. It was important to prevent that early. I think the game is already lost, so I agree with you that just defending is too slow. But everything else seems hopeless too.]
;W[pe]
(;B[qf]C[PETE: Now that I think abou this, I'm surprised that my opponent answered.

Hon: I felt the same intuitionally, but I guess black was right.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[lg];B[kh];W[ie];B[he];W[lf]C[PETE: I feel a little better now .. but I still can't believe I gave away all of the upper right side and the top right corner while my group at the bottom right is still not stable.

Hon: It is the logical result of you having weak groups.

Also I think that black can afford to lose this stone after R18.]
;B[er]C[Hon: Game over.];W[gm];B[sq];W[rk];B[rj];W[sl];B[sp]
;W[so];B[sr];W[qo];B[fk]C[PETE: I was hoping to build a wall by playing around this same spot. I'm starting to think that winning this game is going to be hard unless I do something dramatic....

Hon: It is too late for that now.

Here the review ends. The important think you have to learn about this game is that your perception about the fuseki is wrong. You are afraid of moyos, but you leave weak groups everywhere. The opposite is correct! Moyos are nothing you have to be afraid of, you can still invade them. But weak groups you really should care about! If you can defend a weak group with just one move (like R9), then you should do it now, not keep it for later. Never!

You made three weak groups in the process of the game: Top left, bottom left, bottom right. Each of them, as you see now, ended up holding close to no points. At the same time, by attacking the weak groups, black was able to make a lot of easy profit in the lower left, lower right and upper right. This is where you lost.

Remember this: Defending a weak group with one move is always worth taking gote now. As long as all your groups are safe, it will be no problem to reduce a moyo later.]
;W[co]C[PETE: but I did something stupid instead. This didn't work. Was there a better way to go in here?]

;W[gn]C[PETE: too slow? I was trying to read this out and I think if Black played at G6, I would be in trouble.]

;B[nl];W[om]C[PETE: Feels too slow. the 3 stones will probably be OK without being connected to the big group - they can probably link up with the stones to the left, right?]

(;W[rm]C[Hon: You can go for a ko. That is better than connecting in a dumpling shape.]

(;W[rl]C[Hon: This is the move.]))
(;W[on]C[Hon: I would play here. This somewhat combines Q11, the lower right and your center group. You need to prevent attack!

Q16 will do okay somehow. Of course a territorial move like O16 or N16 looks good, but when there are weak groups around, then there simply is no territorial move. Urgent moves before big moves!]
))
(;W[gd]C[Hon: I think you should rather play this. Now he can not make any pressure moves anymore against your top, and it is easier for you to defend the center group, because you don't have to look behind.

But let me remind you that your fuseki over all is not good here. You have 3 weak groups. Maximum is one weak group, but you should try to have not even a single one. Black can attack the lower right at any time, he can attack the top left center, and the bottom group would also feel better with a stone at J5. You hurried around way too much!]

(;W[gd];B[ch];W[gf]C[Hon: This looks like another option. You ask him to connect on the 2nd line, then you get to defend your group and build up influence towards the large empty ground in the upper right.]

(;W[qk]C[Hon: You have to play here. After you played S4, this is necessary, because otherwise black can hunt you. In the fuseki it is important that you do not have weak groups!]

;W[tt];B[qk]C[Hon: ... If black attacks you, you can still ...]
;W[qq]C[Hon: ... enter at 3-3 and be alright. After you have solidified black's corner with S4, this excuse is gone, and therefore you have to settle your group with R9.]

(;W[fq]C[Hon: Like this.])
(;W[jq]C[Hon: Or maybe this.]))
(;B[he]C[Hon: If he goes on like this, where is your influence? And where is the complications?

I mean, although the result may be alright, your moves ended up doing the opposite of what you were planning!]
))
(;W[be];B[de];W[bf];B[cc];W[bd];B[dh];W[ci]C[Hon: I think one idea would be to press back at him to make some points on the one side, while he runs on the other, and C11 neutralizes the influence of D4.]
