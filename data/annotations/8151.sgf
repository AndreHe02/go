C[Black (10k) won this game by 2.5 points, but with only .5 komi due to the one stone strength difference.  If it had been an even game, white (9k) would have won.

I am especially concerned with white's plays following tengen, and black's response.  It seemed white got too much, too easily.

[qq:D]C[I am curious about this response, and not sure what to make of it.  How to take advantage of it being looser than o3 or o4?

[comment\]
There is no way to take immediatly advantage. The follow ups after this move can get very complicated. But it is ok for Black to treat this move as if White had played at 'B'. That's also what I would do. Because the follow ups can get very complicated and only high dans understand them right.
See variations starting with 'C' and 'D' just to get a feeling. ;-)]

This is alright. I wouldn't play differently.];W[qq];B[qk]C[I feel like choosing this joseki may have helped w naturally defend the large knight, and so it was perhaps not so good.

[comment\]
Simplifying is ok for Black. It may result in small territorial loss, but that did not decide the game result.]
;W[jq]LB[nc:B][jd:A][cn:C]C[[comment\]
This is actually a small move. White's bottom group is already stable.
White should better approach the corners or play an extension on the top.]

I think you got a bad result in this corner. That's why I want to explain in detail, what happened from my view. Here are a lot of variations. I will guide you through.

[es]C[[comment\]
This double pincer seems a bit odd to me. White must not stay away from the local fight! White should play instead at 'B' or 'C'.
Why? Compare the marked territory: White gets max. 6 points with the double pincer on the side. Playing at 'B' instead would result in at least 10 points in the corner!

So how should Black respond? White omitted to take the corner, so Black should play there! This is often a very simple logic: "Play, where your opponent would play."
So 'D' or 'E' are possibilities for Black. I would recommended 'D'. See the variation for continuation.]
(;B[dn]TR[jq]C[[comment\]
Corner is more important!
If the marked stone on the bottom would be black, your choice would be better.]
;W[cq]C[[comment\]
Ouch! Now White got a move on the side plus corner. Bad for Black.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq]C[Normally black can't get away with this hane, but with d6 it seems reasonable. What other ways can b use his extra stone at d6 to come out ahead in this sequence?

[comment\]
The hane here is fine. Your extra stone surely helps, but I don't know any special moves.]
;W[bp]LB[bo:A][ep:B]TR[cg][cj]C[[comment\]
I would probably simly connect with 'B'. Playing 'A' has the disadvantage, that you don't get a good wall anyway, because White has a stable base right in front of it. You also get a bad shape.]
(;B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er]LB[fq:A][fr:B]C[I thought about a double hane here, but it doesn't seem to work.

[comment\]
Double hane doesn't work.]
(;B[fq];W[fr]LB[ep:A]TR[cn]C[[comment\]
Comparing to the variation after move 22 you may see, that Black's shape is not so good. For example, there is a cut at 'A'.
Also White's marked stone has some aji left.];B[ej]LB[cc:B]
[pf:C][kj:D][gq:A]C[[comment\]
Because your shape is so bad on the bottom, you might want to play 'A'. But considering the circumstances, it seems slow.
I think I understand, why you played the move on the left. But there are bigger ones.
Depending on your attitude, you could invade at 'B' or spoil your moyo with playing 'C' or even 'D'.]
;W[gq]C[[comment\]
Now White is taking advantage of your bad shape.];B[gp];W[hq]
;B[fo]LB[bo:A][ep:B]SQ[gr][hr][ir][gs][hs][is]C[Is this move necessary, or something around here? I would prefer to move somewhere bigger, but the cuts at e4/f4 looked nasty.

[comment\]
White got 6 points in sente.
You see, that the problems for that are connected to the block on 'A' instead of 'B'.]
;W[qc]LB[nc:A][qf:B]C[I think w should reduce before making black even thicker up here. Is that correct?

[comment\]
Well, generally speaking you are right. White should approach at 'A' or 'B'.
I think White had the following reasons:
If you look from a territorial point, White has about 50 points of secure territory (huge bottom, some on the top left). Black has only about 30 points of secure territory (some on the left and right, big potential on the top, but no secure territory yet).
I think that is why White invaded. He takes a big chunk from you potential territory and makes some points himself.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]LB[od:B][re:A]C[This isn't joseki. How to punish? p/q 18?

[comment\]
Black can connect at 'B' and enclose White or at least reduce the corner.]

'A' is much better.];W[on]C[[comment\]
Good!];B[ol];W[ec];B[fd];W[cc]LB[eg:A][jj:C][ll:B]C[[comment\]
I think 'B' is better. It develops Black's territory much better. This move also helps to avoid White's invasion at 'C'.]
;B[eg];W[jj]LB[ki:B][jl:C][jo:A]C[Now, this seems like overplay.  How should w respond? I think now that perhaps k8 would have been best.

[comment\]
I would probably play 'B' to secure the territory. Because after 'A' or 'C' I don't see the possibility to kill White and he is walking through your main territory. If you are a bold fighter, you should play 'C'. But for me the result is incalculable.]
(;B[jo];W[jl];B[mm]LB[jo:55]C[I just don't want w connecting anywhere, but this doesn't put enough pressure on him and he's able to make a strong group.

Right. There is no pressure on White. Starting with move 55, which was too loose.]

This seems a good result for Black.
Securing at least 15 points in the corner and taking sente.
Also compare this situation with the variation after move 14. Then you might see, that White's pincer is too low.
