US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[5.5];B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[dj]C[I personally don't play the san-ren-sai a lot, although it is a
perfectly legitimate opening.


The important thing, though, is to understand the theory behind it.  If you play D10 just
because, "Gee, lots of pros play it,"  you could be getting into trouble.     Here's the key thing to remember: san-ren-sai is *not* a territorial opening.  It is aimed

at influence and power, and needs to be followed up by vigorous attack.  If you are going to

try to convert the san-ren-sai into secure territory early on, you are going to end up
falling behind.];W[fq]
(;B[fp]L[hq]C[> I thought that with q3 being low that this joseki would be appropriate


This move is OK, but I think the more important relationship is with D10.  This joseki
stabilizes white, and makes him immune to attack, which compromises B's power.

You might consider the pincer at "a", a la the variation.];W[gp];B[fo];W
[eq];B[dq];W[jq];B[dn]C[> is d6 necessary? prudent?

It is prudent, but not really necessary with D10, and has two major faults:
1) it is over-concentrated (and territorial)
2) it is gote

Better to study the variations following the push at E4 and cut at D5,
so that you can live in the corner if needed, and take sente here.

O17 would be nice, and so would Q5 or R5.];W[fc];B[hc];W[cf]C[White here wants to avoid the variation that I discussed for the lower right.]

(;B[bd]C[> i didn't know how to deal with
> c14, i thought about f16 or e15 i know that the choice i made was bad

Yes, either F16 or E15 would be much better.  E15 is probably the simplest.
You might see something like variation 1.

The main point is this:


White has two lonely stones.  Your strategy should be to split them, lean on one to build
thickness, and swallow the other in a big way.];W[db];B[dc];W[cb];B[fd]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[ec];B[ed];W[hb];B[ic]C[> i was happy with this wall especially because of LL corner


Well you should be.  This is a great result for Black.  Diving into the corner and
crawling along accomplishes nothing for white.];W[ib];B[jc];W[ci]C[Trying to live here right away is probably a mistake for white...]
;B[cj];W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[df];W[dg]
(;B[fi]L[eg]C[Basically the right idea, but maybe not the best move.
Letting W get E14 is a shame.

Consider the variation at "a".];W[ef];B[de]C[How important is this stone to save?  Don't automatically answer each atari.
There may be bigger points to take.];W[fg];B[hh];W[hf];B[je];W[ie];B[id]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[bi];B[bj]C[> the entire sequence pleased me until b10. i played it becuase i was  > worried about having f11 and h12 cut off

This is OK.  It gives you lots of stable territory, and W is not completely
alive yet.];W[mc];B[kf]C[I don't think this is the right direction.  You are pushing the  White group down into your moyo.  Don't fear for the Black group at the top;
it's fairly secure.  Try to stay on the offensive, and remember this key rule:

Don't actually try to kill, but make gains while *threatening* to kill.]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[jh];B[lc]C[> m17 was to ensure eyes

This is far too passive.  Sure, it makes your group really, really safe,  but it doesn't do anything else, and it's 100% gote.    You need to keep the pressure on White, or at least go for a big point.]
;W[lb];B[ld];W[nb];B[eh]C[This seems like a reasonable forcing move, causing W to connect where he
is already connected.];W[eg];B[hg]C[But this is not.  It doesn't help you at all, but forces W to fix a defect.
There is now no chance of a cut.];W[gg];B[qo]C[> taking this point seems good to me

Yes, this is a good area, but I might have gone one line higher (Q5).];W
[po];B[pn];W[qp];B[oo];W[pp];B[qn]C[> should i connect at p6

I think so.  The big potential territory for White now is on the bottom.
P6 would greatly limit that.  You could sack R5 without losing much.];W
[on];B[no]C[Running with this stone now is probably a mistake.    You are creating a big juicy target for W to attack.  Better to save
the potential (aji) of this stone, and (maybe) develop it later.];W[om]
;B[ql]C[My intuition is that this is the wrong tactical move here.  I think
either Q8 or R9 would be better.];W[ln]C[> i can only assume that my response to p6 was completely wrong,

This is why running with the P5 stone (ie move at O5) was a mistake.
Might have been better to reduce with something like L4 instead of O5.

Or, P7 followed by R14, trading your side for his bottom, might be reasonable.

Something else that cries out is the area around G5.   
This is a crucial point for develop both you center, and his bottom.  It's sente
for whoever gets it first...];B[lo];W[mn];B[ko]C[Very good.  Better to get ahead in the flight to safety, than
to lose everything trying to save two stones...];W[mo];B[kq];W[jp];B[jo]
;W[kr];B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[lq];B[lp];W[mp];B[kp];W[lr];B[ip]C[Oops.  This is gote for you, which is a big problem right now.
Much better to leave this area, and go for, say, R14.

Losing sente now is probably what turned the game...];W[iq];B[io];W[qj]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[ph];B[qd]C[> i know that i can invade and get ko, but can i do better?  > is there a better place to attack?

;W[pa];B[qa];W[qb];B[rj]C[> i liked this threat because it helped the life of my group
> was it too small?

Yes, I think so.  You should be able to get more than this from the ko.
You have all kinds of attacks on the D13 group.   Even H3 is bigger than this.]
;W[ra];B[ri];W[rh];B[rp]C[Oops.  Gote again.  You've got to constantly tell yourself,  "Sente, sente, sente!"

For example, you might resume the attack on the (still not
quite alive) D13 group.  You could make territory in
the middle while doing this.  J10 might be a good start.];W[rq];B[ro];W
[qi];B[rk];W[jj]C[See, isn't this terrible?  You lose territory, he gains safety.]
;B[hk];W[jm];B[dr];W[hm]C[> was d2 the wrong choice
> it destroyed 12 points of w territory when he didn't respond

I think D2 was a little too early.  If W can take sente, and make three
moves worth four points each, it outweighs the 12 your gain later.]
(;B[fm]C[> how should i defend against h8,  > this turned out ok because i think he made a mistake

Because of your thickness, I think you can G7, instead.  See variation.]

You can see the root of your loss in that you wasted your biggest asset:

the thick wall at the top.  You didn't get any territory from this wall, either
directly or indirectly by attacking other groups.  Instead, you pushed white
down into your center moyo, spoiling the territorial prospects there.
