C[A game vs blixo 6k on KGS (I play black)];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd]
;W[dp];B[jd]C[My most comfortable opening];W[cf];B[ee]C[Running fuseki experiment]
;W[bd];B[dg]C[Press for outside influence];W[cg];B[dh]C[Keep at it]
;W[ch]C[Olaf: thats perhaps a bit slow. I would jump to C11 instead]

(;B[cc]C[Got both corner and the outside, I'm very satisfied with this]

(;W[bc]C[Olaf: too submissive in my eyes. white has stones at hoshi too, so both have to struggle for influence.]
;B[bb];W[qf];B[oe]C[If it went so well on one side, why not the other as well? Perfect for middle dominance]
;W[rd];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[id]C[Ah well, someone saw trough my plan ;)
Olaf: perhaps it would be easier to play on the other side at L16 (or around)? There are some forcing moves around O17, which can be a great help for any group in that area.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[he];W[gd]C[Expected k17 and white living along the edge]
;B[jc];W[ge];B[gf];W[ff];B[fe];W[hf];B[gg]C[I feel comfortable here, couldn't spot any ways for white to make trouble]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[hh];B[if];W[gh];B[fg];W[fh];B[ef]C[thought this was better than e13 at the time because of the eye shape, but guess e13 is better for further options outwards (or perhaps d14?)
Olaf: i like E14 too. E13 forms poor shape and clearly not D14.]
;W[fj]
(;B[ih]C[nice moyo forming];W[di];B[qn]C[Was hoping for a pincer here, guess you can't get your opponent to cooperate everywhere
Olaf: Thats a truth in go. :-)
Olaf: the right side is more or less uninteresting. So perhaps R6 is a mistake in the direction of play. I would prefer K4 instead.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[nn]C[Possibility for fifth line territory on the edge was my plan here]
;W[lh]C[a bit deep I thought, but hard to attack as it is, afraid of making white stronger without gaining anything here]
;B[qh]C[consolidate the edge, hope for a deep white invasion there as well, should make an attack sure profit.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[re];W[qe];B[qd]C[thought I saw something here, guess it was just hot air]
;W[rc]
(;B[hi];W[gj]C[obvious reply I forgot to consider.];B[ci]C[Olaf: if you don't see a good followup, this move is clearly too agressiv. There is still the "feels-too-deep" invasion of M12 on the board. If you have the feeling, that this stone is too deep, then try to utilize it. One possibility is to chase that stone into the white moyo on the bottom. That way you can invade that moyo easily. The first step for this plan you allready reached, as you got stable on the right.]
;W[dj];B[bi];W[ck]C[White is confident, but I'm sure I could have made something with more skill here...
Olaf: my skill isn't good enough to find a good way for black here too. So perhaps its too complecated at all to play it.]
;B[ag];W[bh];B[ah];W[bf];B[af];W[cd];B[cb];W[ae]C[and I'm out of liberties and ways.]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[jp]C[Why not just pincer at once if this is what you'll play?
Olaf: because the 2 stones are more heavy as a single stone would be. If you want to attack, a good way is, too first make the target of attack more heavy.]
;B[cn];W[co]C[Olaf: better to split the too black groups? what about D6?]
;B[ep];W[dq];B[en];W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[cl];W[bj];B[fm]C[b6 hurts a bit, but I don't think I've the time to play there myself
Olaf: F7 seems to be necessary.];W[bn];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm];W[am]
C[I spot another mirage];B[bo];W[an];B[bp];W[bq];B[eh];W[ei]
;B[gi];W[fi]
(;B[ij]C[too scared of playing h10, thought this handled m12 better
Olaf: so you aren't happy with J10 either? If you didn't like any move that protects the cut, there is another possibility: Consider to abandon the 2 stones. K9 looks good in my eyes.]
;W[ji]C[But playing j11 straight away is probably smarter, avoid giving white this
Olaf: Thats due to the decision to hold on the 2 stones. Now you have to connect in bad shape.]
;B[ii];W[lk]
(;B[kj]C[Olaf: wrong direction! this way you are looking for trouble. Imagin that for every move from this side, white gets stronger in the other direction, namely to the right. Now answer the question: "Where i am strong, and where i am not?" 
You have to look for other moves to attack white. First the right side is a bit open, so the first thing to consider is a move that combines an attack with securing the territory on the right, like P9 for example. This move makes it a bit too easy for white to escape to the bottom, so the next thing is to consider before taking territory on the right, trying something about the escaperoute to the bottom. M6 or N5 comes to mind. An additional effect of this way is, that it too helps the group arround E6.]
;W[lj];B[li];W[mi];B[ki];W[nj];B[mh];W[nh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nf]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[of];B[ne];W[pf];B[og]C[Olaf: its hard to cut this way. First thing that springs into the eye is: it forms an empty triangel and thus robs black a liberty too. Next, it doesn't have an effect on the white corner group, so black has to fear an attack now arround Q10. Evan if this attack fails to kill black, the whole territoy on the right will be destoyed this way.]

(;W[rf]C[Can white capture with q10 or s12?
Olaf: at least i would be afraid of it.];B[oi];W[ni];B[oj];W[kk]
C[white preasures me down, which is where I want to go anyway]
;B[jk];W[km];B[jm];W[kn];B[lo]C[still think I have a shot at killing, or if not, invading a bit]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln]C[doh];B[no];W[mp];B[po];W[qp]
C[feel I have a safe lead now, with the right edge pretty secure
Olaf: i count a 6 point lead for black, i wouldn't call it a safe lead. :-)]
;B[nk];W[il]C[has potential for sure];B[jl];W[kl]C[but white backs down; I was a bit dissappointed, I would have played h7 or something for sure
Olaf: yes, white has the chance to attack your lower right group now.]

C[a bit of territory, and a bit safer connection];W[ip];B[hp]
;W[hq]
(;B[jo]C[and I forget m4 is dead. Perhaps m3 first for aji?
Olaf: if you want to do something at the bottom, you should add M3. There are good chances, that white has to take that group from the board, which is worth at least 4 points.]

;W[tt];B[hj];W[tt];B[aj];W[cj]C[this is whites mistake, going over this after the game afterwards I see that white can safely play b9; b4 is dead]
;B[ao]C[Snapback city, white resigns.

I was sure I had this game in my pocket from start to end, but in the end, if white had played b9, he'd have won by 2.5, even without the komi! What am I missing? What advice can you give, not on specific plays, but in general terms what I should do and look for?

Olaf: there was a lot of chances, where white could completly turn the table. And at the end your prospects where a little bit too optimistic. :-)]
