;B[fd];W[fe]C[this is a test move, w's aim is c17 c18 and cut.]
;B[gd];W[cc];B[dd]C[anyway b should play c18, w can settle too easily]
;W[cd]
(;B[cb]C[too soft.];W[dg]C[better at c14, the cut is still severe.]
;B[ch]C[questionable, if w had answered at c13, the cut is gone (ajikeshi(, and also b keeps weaknesses at c10 or d9.]
;W[fh];B[ge];W[bb];B[ce]C[very mean :) the problem was that f12 doesnt really prepare a move at b18.]

(;W[cf]C[this move is a little bad shape, as it doesnt capture the stone, and there is an atari at e15.]
;B[be];W[db];B[eb]
(;W[ca];B[bf];W[hh];B[ea]C[this exchange is probably not good, b can save it as a ko threat, and now he puts himself in shortage of liberties.]
;W[da];B[ee];W[df];B[ff];W[dh];B[ci];W[ei];B[ic]TR[da][ea]C[i think this move is played to protect the cut, but without the marked exchange, there was nothing to defend :)
this is a very submissive move, i think i would play  d8 and eventually sacrifice e18 and e19.]
;W[cn]C[w really should play k17! this is a move one shouldnt miss, it's like if black would have run with head against a wall.:)]
;B[cl];W[en];B[fp];W[gn];B[hp];W[el]TR[hp][gn]C[the marked exchange is bad for white: b makes a lot of points below.
actually, w should not have invaded here, he gets gote, and after k17 and b at d8, w still could have played c3 to live (or something else)]
;B[qi]C[k17 certainly is more urgent.]
(;W[ck]C[very bad];B[bk];W[dk];B[bm]C[only b gains here, with this move.]
;W[qk];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf]C[q14 is the only move, because of...]
;W[pf]C[this move. White gets excellent shape and black isn't still alive.]
;B[nc]C[very agressiv, since his group at the right isn't alive yet, black might get into trouble by playing here.]
;W[oc];B[nb]C[again.:( B really should play o 16 without thinking.]
;W[nd];B[jc];W[lc]C[locally m16 is a better move. globally w should q13 to attack the right side first.]
;B[lb];W[md];B[kb];W[qg];B[rg];W[pg];B[oi];W[ri]C[if w wants to cut, should play q11 immediately (then he doesnt need to give away 2 stones)]

;W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[rn]C[too far. should be s5 (joseki)
if instead r2 b had played s2, wq1 br2 wp3 then s6 is joseki.]

;B[hi];W[gi];B[gj];W[gk]C[although this is also easy. :)];B[hk]

i will stop here, the rest is endgame

i will be happy to answer again :).
