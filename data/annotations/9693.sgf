AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer, I'd be happy if you could do a review for both sides. I have added a few comments and questions marked with "H:"

For black, myself, please focus on telling me where I did not play solid enough -- I tend to leave vulnerable positions behind -- and where I should have taken a bigger risk.

For white, bytewurm, please tell me where he could have played more aggressively to try and annihilate my handicap.

Joachim: Hi, this is your reviewer. I try to review this game for both white and black.]
PL[W]
(;W[qq]C[This will give white some points and black outside influence. In a a high-handicap game like this one, the outside influcence will be too good for black, therefore, 3-3 is not considered to be a good move for white.]

(;B[jd]C[Not good. You should replied in the lower right corner with the standard joseki. See variation]

(;B[pq]C[H: among the corners q4 and d16, I thought of q4 being the one more worthwhile to defend right now against a 3-3 invasion, correct?

And shouldn't white 23 be one of the options I show?

joachim: This is indeed an important moment in the game with many options for black.

Q2 is not the right direction. You have a nice stone at Q10, so R4 would allow this stone to work nicely with a horizontal wall, see vatiation

However, the most urgent move is to simply respond to C17 with C16. This would have developed your left side around D10.]

(;W[qr];B[qp]C[I like black R4. Q2 is not bad, but black cannot make points at the bottom, so R3 is better.]

(;B[rn]C[too slack. Why not T1?];W[dc];B[fc]C[H: Is this move possible? I thought it was with K-16 in place.

No, this is not a good move, I gives white too much space and liberties.
You are at a disadvantage here, because you did not answer the initial white 3-3 invasion in move #21. I would play C16 here.]
;W[eb];B[ec];W[cd];B[de];W[ce]C[Now, white is invading into the left side, where you have the nice wall in the 4th line. This is sad. However, you still have the top.]
;B[qd];W[rd]C[H: Would it have been possible to capture the white group?

I am not sure, but I think, the white can only live if it wins two kos. This is good for black. See variations]

;W[lh];B[lg];W[mh];B[og]C[H: Here I systematically built territory on the top; how could white have stopped me?

I think, white cold not have stopped you. Your two walls in the F and ! line are too strong.

;W[mm];B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[oj]
(;B[sr]C[H: Could this white group have died, or was it alive?

I think that seki is the best black can get if white plays correctly. I am not 100 % sure though.
You might want to show this to a player that is stronger than me.

Black S1 is the another attack with seki as a result.]

;B[dh];W[eg];B[ph];W[lc]C[H: and here begins a white invasion; bytewurm and myself practiced a few in this game. Is it possible to invade this territory without black making a stupid mistake?

No, it should not be possible for white to invade and you defended well.

White needs  a lot of space (around 40 free spaces) to live.
Alternatively, white needs to be able to explore weaknesses in blacks shape. This is the standard strategy for an invasion: get some sente-moves that the opponent needs to respond to in defense. Here however, your position is super-strong and white has none of theses sente-moves. May be F16, but that can be answered with G16. --> white cannot invade sucessfully.

White could have invaded earlier though, around move 59. The two stones E18 and E19 are very small in comparison to an invasion at the top.

However, even if white can invade the top, black would probably have gained with soned that make the right side larger. Difficult decision by white.]

(;B[oq]C[H: was this move necessary? I was afraid that I'd lose the black wall and then the whole bottom right corner if white played there.

This is actually the wrong defense, I think. See variation to save all black stones.]

C[White: 57 territories + 2*2 dead stones(B) + 7 prisoners + 6 komi = 74
Black: 99 territories + 2*13 dead stones(W) + 2 prisoners = 127
Result: B+53

I think that white lost this game because of the 3-3 invasions at the beginning. This allowed black to get a ton of influence in the center and thus make points.

White should aim at playing at the sides first instead of invading the corners too early. Later invading one or two corners at 3-3 can be ok, but invading all 4 corners too early is not good.]
