C[- Hi!

- Im now playing GO for one month and I want to ask where my biggest mistakes are. Maybe I should try to be more offensive or
- defensive...? Connect more or play more nets...? Maybe you can add some comments at my strongest mistakes?

- I have also added some comments and questions.

- Thank you very much, skat

- P.S. If you want you can comment in German ;)

$ Hello,
I m Sylvain (sylvainc ok kgs, around 2k)
I will comment for both, but in english (sorry i don't speak german at all). All my comments will begin with '$']

(;W[co]C[- I dont know how to react to that.

$ white makes here a mistake. the C6 stone is alone and weak. when you play contact on a weak stone, you reinforce it. see the following moves and after see "when this move can be good"

see what white could play and compare the result for both]
(;B[fq]C[$ black should extend on D6]
(;W[eq];B[bo];W[bp]
(;B[bm];W[dn];B[dm];W[eo]LB[ic:C][em:A][qn:B]TR[fq]C[$ in my opinion, it s not the time to care this stone now. A,B, C are big points. I prefer B because approch on the hoshi stone is sente move.]
;B[fr]C[- Thought about F5 but I decided to build 2 stable bases and to play something around F6 later. I gave up the corner.]

(;W[er];B[go];W[fp];B[gp]LB[fp:A][gp:B][gq:C]TR[go][fq]C[$ general shape : if you push in a keima (triangle stones) it is SURE after white A black answer B. Then black is stronger than before, and white gained nothing... excepted if white cut at C.

then, if you push trhow a keima, do it ONLY if you can cut after. If you don t cut, then don t push.]

(;W[cf]LB[ed:B][cf:A][qf:C][em:D]C[$ consider 4 moves :
A, B, C, D.

I m sorry A is the worst : approch on a 3-4 stones is always make on the B side. Look at the following sequence after A.

so B would be better, but C is also a good approch and extend from Q4 side. but here, if white play D then black has to extend so D helps corner stones to escape to center and is absolute sente]

(;B[ed]C[$ as saw in previous variation, E16 is better after the exchange C12 - E14]
;W[ef]TR[cf][ci]C[$ first, white should have make a base with a 2 space extension]
