C[You play very well in this game.  There are a couple of cute tesujis you can find, like the 'reverse monkey-jump' on the bottom, as well as a move to kill the bottom right.  However, those are much less important than the overall ideas.  I recommend you scroll back though the game, and look for the point at which you feel that one move from your opponent would make a lot of territory on top.  That is the point at which you most urgently need to deny it.]

(;B[dc]C[Given that white can lean on you and seal you into the corner, I think I prefer C16.  While you can still be pushed inside, you get more for it.]

(;W[nc];B[pf];W[nq];B[pn];W[kc];B[dd]C[Good, this was a huge move.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[lp];B[pj]C[Generally it's safer to balance your high and low stones on the side.  For example, here R10 would be easier to make territory from.  Too many high stones leaves third-line invasions, and too many low stones is flat and doesn't give enough points.  Alternatively, D6 or D7 is still huge.]
;W[ec];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[gd];B[dl]C[I like the sequence you used here.  I would've been tempted to try to turn at F14 to see if white would respond, but this is reasonable and safe.  Speaking of safe, I prefer D7 to D8, but this is definitely the right idea.]
;W[gg];B[eh];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[dn]C[This is why I preferred D7 over D8.  It would let you take sente out of this sequence.  Right now the top right is urgent.  Whoever gets to play N15 or O15 will profit a lot, so getting sente on the left is important.]
;W[ch];B[cf]C[This is reasonable but a bit passive.  I think D11 is more my style.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[pb]
(;B[qc];W[nf];B[og];W[qr];B[rp]C[You can safely play this at S2 to get more points.  However, again I feel that responding is small here.  I would prefer O13 to claim more central power.  It will not take your opponent much to seal the middle, so it would have been good to deny it.]
;W[mh];B[ol];W[qb];B[cj];W[ii]
(;B[no]C[Your stones on the right are totally safe, so I would go farther.  However, the bottom isn't nearly as threatening as the top, which is almost sealed into territory.]

(;B[mr]C[If white plays Q3 to try to make an eye, you will still have O2 to falsify it.  Regardless, strengthening M2 helps more if you don't win the fight, so it's probably worthwhile as such.  In this case though, I think it kills.]

(;B[cd];W[ce]C[After C16, white could try to seal you in or claim the corner, but you would have an opportunity to fight over either.  Here you would be able to crosscut at D15 and go for influence to work with the bottom if you chose to.]
