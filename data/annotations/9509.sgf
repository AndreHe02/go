(;B[cj]C[This is a very good move.

It admits to the kind of future sequence as shown, but makes a very strong play along the side.]

(;W[fc];B[jc]SQ[cd]C[This is another very strong move, I think you're way stronger than 20kyu.

The two marked stones are very strong. The k17 works very well with Q17. If you've played this many moves on the 3rd line, it is folly to attack them, white should rather play a few big 4th line moves to gain influence while black emphasizes territory.]
;W[cb]C[This is a deep jump. I think someone stronger than I could kill C18.

In Go you need to respect your opponent. That usually means you must concede some territory to them, as long as you gain as least as much for yourself. Since white's potential on the upper side is severely hampered by the excellent K17, it makes sense to try and gently force white away from the left side. Worst case white will get some of the corner and a little bit of territory between F17 and K17. All the while, you will be playing moves on the outside of his group that work very well with K17, Q17 and C10 and you will definitely come out ahead, even though white's group has lived.

Here are some sequences I would try.]
(;B[dc]C[This is also not bad. the koan says "keima -> kasumi" which means "knight's move should be countered with diagonal move"

the ogeima or long knight's move as white played here has the same truth hold.]
;W[qf]TR[db]C[This is a dreadful mistake by white.

The koan goes "urgent moves before big moves" this was a big move, while D18 or E18 was urgent.

Black should probably ignore R14 and play at the triangle. Often it seems like the opponent is making bigger moves like R14, but you should punish him for playing too loose.

If you can kill C18 and set F17 to running while building influence and solid territory you should!

Here's my continuation]
(;B[qe]C[This isn't bad, but you are following your opponent around the board, instead of setting the pace yourself.]
;W[pe]C[The proper play is actually R16 for you now]
(;B[pd];W[jq];B[oe]C[This move is slow. What does white lose if he ignores this move and you spend another move taking the white stone?

Consider white makes the following play, do you think you are ahead?]

(;W[qk];B[pk]TR[db][je][dg][ej][co][qo][eq][oq]C[contact plays solidify both your position and your opponents. While there are massive moves left like the marked triangles

I would ignore white's Q9 and play elsewhere, probably at any of the marked triangles]
;W[rk]C[luckily this move is very slow.

White should not play on the second line this early in the game. There are no stones at risk of dying. Also, there are no groups. If your opponent wants to spen 4 stones to capture a single stone, you happily play your 4 moves elsewhere on the board. 2nd line plays are there to protect territory that has taken shape, or to threaten invasion of opponent's territory or framework.

White failed here and black should play anywhere else. At this point capturing Q15 is definitely the best move. It lines up Q9 for connection and promises to push the slowly forming white group against the side, while making huge framework with all the other stones.]
;B[co]TR[ej]C[This isn't bad, but your positions are all very low (3rd line)

you should start making moves into the center of the board. Something like the marked triangle threatens F17's future and works well with your stones on the left side.]
;W[eq];B[ep]C[This is wrong. Nothing can be gained by attaching here. Remember, if you attach to a stone, you have 3 liberties, your opponent has 3, and it is your opponent's turn to play. This means that you are behind in the fight from the moment you start it.

You should only play contact moves (and that includes diagonal attachments) when you want to get into a territory and you're happy if you get some solidity out of it and your opponent does, too.

Playing at E5 or F5 would be much better. Your opponent would have to attach to YOU if he wants to reduce the massive framework that is starting to build for you on the left of the board.]
;W[gp]C[If I were whtie i'd push F4 or run F3, followed by the hane at G4.

Still, it should be obvious to you that you have not gained anything here. You need to play E6 to claim your territory.]

(;B[go]C[Your shape is bent over backwards and white can come out kicking...see continuation]

(;W[hp]TR[db][ej][en][eo]C[this is a good response.

this weakens your black G5 dramatically. Time to give credit where its due and cash in on some of your framwork. Anywhere I've marked makes for good moves.

The only forcing move for you I would consider instead is Q8, but you've just finished creating an awkward shape in the bottom left, and you can be certain that white is going to punish that shape, so you should make provision.

my favourite is E5. It strengthens your weakest stone and supports your other weak stones. You should expect your opponent to invade between C10 and C5 now, and run to the center.]
;B[ho]TR[cf][ej][en]C[this is greedy. It says "i want to expand my massive framework on the left. But you ignore the fact that white can easily play on the triangle points and live, reducing your framework and making your buttom seem silly.]
;W[fe];B[ee]TR[hb][df]C[don't attach, it strengthens the opponent's weak group. the marked points are better responses as they guide your opponent out while you take territory.

Ignoring white's move and playing D18 now would be a mistake.]
;W[eb]TR[je][ef]C[Aaaan whites alive. You new mission is to stop tryign to kill it, and just make moves that turn your super massive frameworks into territory. See the marked stones.

A bit later when the open space starts to disappear you need to pick a time to play H18, but white already looks too good.]
;B[db]C[This move cannot be ignored, but cannot hope to succeed. This is the exact definition of an excellent ko-threat. In any ko fight this move would win you serious points as white would have to decide between the group he is ko-fighting for, and the topleft corner.

Leave moves like this alone.];W[ff]
(;B[ef]C[There is a koan "never push from behind" or something like that. This move is a move too late, you should have played it instead of D18, but right now you should play D19 to retake the corner but concede the top left side, or you should play D13 and allow white to push you against the side a bit, see the continuation.

It isn't terrible, but there's a koan "place your stone at the head of two stones" which white will probably now employ but playing at E13. This induces a bend and a bunch of cutting points for future exploit.]

(;W[fh]C[I would play as shown instead.];B[eh];W[gi];B[fj]C[this move is a bit awkward given E12. I would have played E10 instead, then yo uhave very good shape and its not like this move threatens your opponent in any way. You are in no danger and should take sente by playing ad D19 or H18.]
;W[da]C[B18 is the response to this.]
(;B[dd]C[this feel liks a scary cutting point, i know, but i doubt whether white has enough support to jump in there.]
;W[re];B[pf]TR[je]C[this might be conceding the corner to white if white plays S17. but it works very well with stones Q9 and K17, and any play at the marked stones is worth more than the corner. so whatever!]
;W[rd]C[this is a bit slow by white but yah, he's made a strong play for the corner and you've exchanged it for the top. You should not try and kill him, you will fail and he will end up stronger. Rather show that he has made an exchange that leaves you with more territory than him. I'll play as follows.]

(;B[dq];W[bp];B[fq];W[dr];B[er];W[ds];B[hj]C[this move results in a shape with many cutting points. If you want to enclosre white, consider G10 instead.]
;W[id]
(;B[je]C[to live, white needs to make a bunch of moves that you can't ignore while getting more stones on the board himself. You are giving him exactly that kind of opportunity here.]
;W[ic]
(;B[op];W[qo]
(;B[kp]C[L3 might have been better see continuations];W[lr]
;B[jo]TR[hi][gl]C[OK, you want to connect high, he wants to connect low. The benefit is that you are forming strong framework. You should cash in with marked stones very soon as it is almost impossible to defend central territory.]
;W[hr];B[oo]C[this move is too slow. It doesn't threaten white at all and helps a stone whose only purpose seems to be seperating two white groups that are both alive already.]
;W[hg]C[if white wants to get eye shape he should play K18. It looks like he wants to reduce yoru framework instead.]
;B[ig]C[this contact move will cost you dearly. Why not play K15 instead and leave the contact moves to him.]
;W[bc];B[ih]C[you have left your topleft black group with a massive open skirt. This move is an example of "urgent moves before big moves" you should play B16 right now instead of this move.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qa];B[pm]C[good sequence. ignoring the peep at R19 until the late end-game.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[fg]
(;B[cf]C[solid connections like E12 are almost always better. you don't need eye shape, your groups are super connected. you need to focus on keeping him out of your territory.]

[li][mi][ni][oi]C[your mission cannot be to keep him out everywhere. you need to pick a subset of your framework that you are willing to abondon. you have too many openings. If you keep him out everywhere you will lose everything. So I wuggest you let him into the triangle marked area.]
;B[og];W[qh];B[pi]C[you have many open skirts like L18, urgent moves before big moves. If you play sente every move, then eventually you will be so over extended that when you eventually lose sente (and you will) then your opponent will dicate the game for several moves as he pushes you back and creates cutting points to exploit later.

You must play moves in mild gote to make future sente moves stronger and more fierce.]

[pf][ej]C[This leaves a very severe cutting point at C14 and C13 becomes an incredibly strong sente move that can be used to disconnect C10 from the growing black group.

I'll see what can be done.

(the continuation seems to show that cutting at C14 fails horribly for white thanks to the stone at C10. That stone is awesome.

anyway, you'll agree that this is a very good result for black. White gained to territory, and black has incredibly strong influence and can secure as much or more territory than white took away with one of two moves played at the squares in any order. I would probably play Q14 first, as the other two are a bit "heavy".]

(;B[qe]C[White has made an extremely slow start playing the 3-3 points. Usually if white plays 4-4 and 4-4 it can be seen as pretty slow for black to play this keima enclosure.

In this case, white is so far behind that black can happily play this move.

Go is ultimately a game of territory, until you are behind there is no reason to start attacking.

This move works well with c16 but would be even better with D16 on the board.

If I were white I'd play one of these two variations.]
