C[I'm Otakung , this game I played Black and I lost 6.5 pts.
 My opponent and I are 5k*.
 please review my game emphasize at the opening about direction or
 joseki.

I have tried to do this, but actually you you played very well in the opening, and got a good lead. The place where you lost this game was in the endgame. Did you get over-confident?   In the endgame you played some small moves when much bigger ones were available. You seem to have lost over 15 points there! Roughly speaking 10 points = 1 grade, so if you got stronger at the endgame the perhaps you could get nearly 2 grades stronger!

In the endgame, it is important to see quickly what parts of the board are important, and what parts are small. If you can see at a glance that one area is small the you can just forget about it until later, and you can concentrate all of your efforts on the areas that are big. This is important because it saves effort. In a sense it is another case of finding the important directions to play in, but in the endgame, not in the opening.

(;B[cc]C[This is probably a mistake. It is not a joseki move.

White's two-space pincer sometimes leads to quite difficult variations, but there are two main lines that will suffice in most situations. Have a look at the variations.]

(;W[qf]C[I do not understand this move. If I was white I would play in the top left.

There are now two places that black would like to play, the two top corners. It would be good to find a way to deal with one in sente so that you can then go on to the other.]

(;B[qh];W[nc]C[This white move is also slighly strange.]
(;B[oe]C[This is probably not the best move. It is normally correct to lean on the white stone on one side in order to attack on the other.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc]C[Otakung:I don't where is better,S15 or
 Q17?

This is a good question.

It is difficult to block at S15 because then the black stone at R21 is probably too close to the black wall. The move you play looks OK.]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[rc]
(;B[pb]C[Why do you connect here? It is not very big, and since white can live ther are probably bigger moves that you can make. Save the moves round here for later.]
;W[qg]C[It is normally bad for white to bang his head into black like this. Perhaps a diagonal move would be better.]
;B[ph]C[Good.];W[of];B[nf];W[og];B[ld];W[ng]LB[ne:B][mf:A]C[I would not push here if I was white. It is more interesting to leave the possibilities of the clamp at A or the cut at B. They don't really work yet, but they might in the future. White should keep his options open, then you have to worry a bit.]
;B[mf];W[cb]C[So white gets sente to play in the top left corner.]

C[Otakung:Now I think that I
 still lead.

Quite right. On the right black has made territory whilst white has made lots of thickness. The problem for white is that all black's groups are safe, so there is nothing worthwhile to do with that thickness.   Counting the territory, black has 25 on the left, 35 on the right, and 10 at the top. That is 70. perhaps a little bit less because the bottom right corner is not 100% territory.

White has 10 in the bottom left, 25 in the top right, 10 in the top right and 5 komi. That is 50. White needs to get 20 points profit from his thickness. That does not seem possible.]

;W[md];B[lb];W[le];B[nd];W[lc];B[mb];W[oo];B[pm]C[This is a slight shape mistake. The normal move is one space lower down. That makes the corner a little bit stronger.]
;W[oq]
(;B[pp]C[Otakung:I don't sure that P2 or Q4 is better or
 another?

P2 does not look good to me. White can cross-cut and settle his stones. See the variation.

Q4 looks good to me. Now black has 30 points solid territory on the right, and white has to find a way to save his stones on the outside.]
;W[mq]C[This is probably white's best move.];B[mp];W[np]C[White might do better to play the cross-cut. This move might be a little bit heavy.]

;W[rq];B[rs]C[I think that you should not do this yet. You cannot actually kill white, reducing the corner to a seki is only worth about 6 points, and you end up loosing more than 6 points on the right edge in exchange.]
;W[os];B[qs];W[sp];B[sr];W[rr];B[lj]C[This looks like the right sort of move, but perhaps it is a bit too loose.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[nn];B[mo];W[nj]C[This move is very difficult to stop, which is why M10 might be wrong.]
;B[nl];W[qj];B[pj];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[rj];W[so];B[rm];W[sm]
;B[sl];W[sn];B[rl]C[It is very painful the way that your right side has been reduced. I now think  that the score is about:

Black: left 25, top 15, right 20. Total 60.

White: Top right: 5, bottom left 15, top left: 25, komi 5. Total 50.

So you are still a bit ahead, but white has caught up a lot.]
;W[al];B[bk];W[ak];B[aj];W[am];B[bi];W[fl];B[mg]C[Why this move? it does not surround any territory.

There seem to be two big moves round the edge: B18 (9 points gote) and somethign around J3. The biggest move in the middle seems to be around K8, which is probably where I would play.]
;W[ni];B[kh]C[Again, this seems not very big.];W[jg];B[ii];W[iq]

Black: left 20, right 15, Top 15, middle 5? Total 55.

White: Top 15, Top right 5, Bottom left 20, komi 5, captures 5, total 50.

;W[fc]C[White defends the corner stone and makes territory (it could also to a two-space jump)]
;B[cj]C[Then black plays a counter-pincer somewhere on the side. This starts a fight.

This is a good thing for black to do IF the stone(s) in the bottom left corner are black stones. In that case black would be able to fight with confidence because the extra stones help.

In this game the "jump out then counter-pincer" plan is not good. The stones in the bottom left are white, so black will get two weak groups.]

Black has a settled group in the corner, and white has a group at the top. Black has sente. Black has a strong position pointing down the left side so it will be difficult for white to make a lot of territory here.   Notice that white has a corner enclosure (shimari) in the bottom left corner. That makes white's pincer move (move 8 in the game) very good. It is a dual purpose move, extending form a corner enclosure and pincering. Black has to prevent white from getting too much of an advantage from this move. That is exactly why this joseki was invented.]
