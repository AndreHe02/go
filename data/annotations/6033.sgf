C[please advise how to handle white by playing safe, simple moves not requiring long reading.  i feel i was lucky on the lower side; im sure white made many overplays and would be interested to know whether you agree.

my objective is to improve my "feel" for a position, so anything you can suggest at a conceptual level, rather than showing me long sequences that end in a capture, would be really appreciated.  thanks.

N: hello, nice objective, we all want to win games without thinking hard ;-) However at some point in go we will need to think about more complicated lines. However there are some things that have more to do with feeling than with reading (at least at my level) for example:

- miai: make a move so that afterwards there are two equivalent options, either you attack on the left, ether on the right

- play flexible: don't get emotionally attached to your territory or stones, be prepared to give up something in order to get something else. Thinking this way, opponents moves that were sente, won't be sente anymore.

- think about key-points: in fights somethimes there are key-points for shape, meaning that the difference of you playing there first or your opponent first is huge.

My comments are preceded by N:
I tried to limmit long sequences, but sometimes could not resist ;-)

Nelis];B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do]C[N: important to play in this area]
;W[fp]LB[co:A]C[N: rather one sided move, A is the most popular answer.]

(;B[kq]C[N: difficult to say this is a bad move, but i think there would be nothing wrong with the normal josekis. Ok white will get the side, buth he will have played all his stones on one side of the board. You must accept your opponent shall make territory somewhere on the board.]

(;W[dj]LB[dl:A]C[N: bad, A is the place to play if black plays tenuki.
