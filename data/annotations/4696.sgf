AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Anthony : Hello, i'm Anthony i will comment this game for you.

About invasion in the corner :
- It's good for black if white crawl on the second line. White win a very little profit and black build a nice and strong wall. 

About resigning : I think that game was over around 160th move.


PeteC [20k\]: hi, have fun...
donjohn [?\]: hi thanks

I am estimating my rank at 25 kyu. In this game, I know that I did not play anywhere near as well as I usually do, but I think that there are still a great number of things that I can learn. Based on my status in my club, I have become quite farmililar with how to play when I have a 9-stone handicap. However, I am not as farmiliar with other handicaps. So, my first question is, what do I do with a 5-stone handicap? What are the strengths of the position, what should my opening responses be, what are the standard opening attacks from white, etc?
Also, what should a respectful player do when he realizes that he is not playing anywhere near his ability, and has no chance of winning the game? At what point in this game would it have been proper for me to resign?]
;W[kd]C[Should I have responded more closely to this?];B[pj]
LB[nc:A][pf:B]C[Anthony : I think it's good. You can also try A or B.]
;W[qc]C[What should I have done here?

Anthony : see variation at 9 and comment at 10.];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[qe]C[The sequence that took place here was repeated in every corner. What should I have done? It is my understanding that in most situations, if my opponent plays at the 3-3, the resulting shape will live. What are the proper moves to limit the 3-3 play?

Anthony : see variation at 9 and comment at 10.];W[re];B[qf]
;W[rf]
(;B[rg]C[Anthony : I feel the hane here is not good for you. As said before, it's good for black to build a strong wall on the third line here. Black have an impressive influence. 
White just crawl on the second line and won a very little territorry.

Note that in the variation white cannot cut at Q15 (black catch with a ladder).]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj];W[pe]C[Three questions:
Should I have responded with P15, give up the two stones and keep him from connecting in the middle? (particularly given the effect on the stones at Q16-17)
What could I have done earlier to prevent the attack and when should I have done it?
After making the Q14 move, what should I have done to keep the disconnected stones alive?

Anthony : 
-P15 seems good for keeping white stones separated. But after this Q17-Q16 will be in a difficult position.
- Playing like variation at move 10 was a good way to prevent your stones to be cut off, as white wasn't able to cut at Q15 (black pick up the stone in a ladder).
- After Q14, maybe black should try to make a base at M17 to secure Q16-Q17 stones (see variation 20).]

;W[qb];B[pb];W[rb];B[nd]LB[lc:A]C[Anthony : I think you should try to make a base here. Something like M17. As this group is still not secure at this point.]
;W[ne];B[me]LB[lc:A]C[Anthony : Again try to secure your stones first. If you had in mind to attack O15-Q15-P15 stones keep in mind that it's better to have a good base before attacking.]

Anthony : Maybe S4 i sente but i'm not sure. 
I think you made well her until move 178.

Anyway, at this point, even if you convert H7 and R7 area in black territorry, white win the game.]

donjohn [26k?\]: thank you


In my opinion, my main overall problems (as far as all games, not specifically this one) are getting and maintaining sente, being overly defensive, and, when I do attack, making attacks that don't work. If you could address things like this in addition to the questions I asked, I'd really appreciate it.

Anthony : I once read that the main goal of attacking is not to kill but to make territory (or upgrading your shape) when attacking.

Also, unless you didn't read exactly the sequence to kill a group, it's better to try something else like extending or securing one of your groups.

Last thing : before attacking, attack from a group that is secured. If not, it's like you are trying to punch something with only one foot on he ground (with a bad balance) : you won't be able to punch with a lot of power.

I hope this review helped you.
