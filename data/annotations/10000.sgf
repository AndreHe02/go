C[Review by DrGoPlayer

DrGoPlayer: Thanks for sending me this game.

I have put variations throughout the game for both sides];B[pd]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[eq];B[cp]LB[co:C][do:A][cq:B]C[DrGoPlayer: also A, B, C are possible for black or tenuki]
;W[cn]LB[dn:A][do:B][dp:C]C[DrGoPlayer: A, B , C are also OK for w]
;B[ep]LB[dn:B][do:A]C[DrGoPlayer: also A or B]
(;W[cq]C[DrGoPlayer: see thread for better w move];B[dq];W[dr]
;B[dp]TR[cn][cr][er]C[DrGoPlayer: w has too many weaknesses - cutting points and a weak stone]

(;W[br]
(;B[fq]C[DrGoPlayer: w can recover somewhat with b4]
(;W[fr]C[DrGoPlayer: there is no point to this move.  B just takes]

(;B[gq]C[DrGoPlayer: no point to this move];W[bp]C[Black needed to keep the two white groups separated.  This was a huge loss.

DrGoPlayer: yes although sente is big here];B[jd];W[pj];B[fc]

(;W[hc]C[DrGoPlayer: sometimes it is better to wait on the invasion.  If b defends then w has gotten 2 moves elsewhere]

(;B[db]C[DrGoPlayer: b offers complex fight]
(;W[cc]C[DrGoPlayer: having invaded w must accept the challenge and fight rather than just respond here.
Playing at D14 or C14 before invading would give w a much better position]

(;B[hd];W[kc]
(;B[ic]C[At this point black misread, thinking the cut worked.  The other move I'd considered was cutting at K17, but J17 seemed simpler and to be effective.  Oops.

DrGoPlayer: see the threads]
(;W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[gc];W[nc];B[qf];W[qh]
(;B[pb]C[DrGoPlayer: This leaves w with some nice choices]
(;W[qo]C[black didn't know how to handle an approach from so close and ...]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[oq]C[... and black definitely didn't know how to handle the double approach from so close]
;B[lq];W[qr];B[rr];W[np]
(;B[oo]C[DrGoPlayer: Do this only if you plan to kill them all - i.e. its sente]
;W[rn]
(;B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[mo]C[DrGoPlayer: because P5 was too soon, w now has a better chance]
;B[lo];W[mn]CR[oo][pp][qp][pq][rq][pr][rr]C[DrGoPlayer:only one eye still.  who is chasing who?  :-)]

(;W[qi]C[This seemed like an unnecessary move.

DrGoPlayer: cutting for b is profitable here];B[ci]
(;W[bg];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl]
(;W[dg];B[dn]C[DrGoPlayer: huge];W[ei]LB[fk:A]C[Black's intuition said to play at A, but couldn't see how to avoid getting cut, living small, and giving white a nice wall.]

(;B[dj];W[fk];B[dh];W[bi];B[bj];W[ch];B[eh]SQ[ei][fk]C[The rest of the game, every black move aims at attacking the marked stones to chase them and make profit]

(;B[jo];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[mq]LB[no:B][lp:A][mr:C]C[Black wants to connect at A  and then cut at B or C, but it looks like white can survive and thrive under that play.]

(;W[oi]C[mistake?  Instead, threaten to live in NE corner.]

(;B[og]SQ[mf][hg][gj]C[Black spent over two hours thinking about this response (and alternatives).  Almost any response allowed white to make an eye in two of the three marked regions.]
