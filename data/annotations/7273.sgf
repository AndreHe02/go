And of course I tried to answer your questions as good as I can. I hope you find it helpfull. Feel free to contact me on kgs.
I'll precede my comments with >


Hi,

I m 15k on IGS and playing white on this game.
I put some comments and questions at 6, 14, 22, 32, 44, 50, 54 and 62.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

fba75];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd]LB[dc:A]C[>Not an ideal placement of your stone here. It almost invites an instant appraoch by black, and you would normally not want to make a move like that. Playing at A would be somewhat better. Of course all is still possible.]
;B[ed]C[>A move like this is to be expected.]
(;W[de]MA[ch]C[I saw after, this is a wrong response to black E16.
White D14 is Joseki.

> You are right it is not joseki, but josekis shouldnt really be a concern yet untill you reach a 10k level. and then even still. It's more important to know why a move is good or bad.

In this case, I would not really call it a bad move, just a little narrow. Black could play in the area of X, or first just push like he did in the game. If black pushes you have just made him stronger without great compensation.]
;B[ee];W[df];B[ic];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[fb]
(;W[nc]TR[pd][ic]LB[qf:A]C[I saw later, I leave a weakness at D17.

>True, but it might be a bit too soon for black to play there, it is not a terrible amount of points there.

However, I think the place where you chose to invade is more troublesome, you just jump into an area where black is stronger than you, so he can expect a good result. This is an envious move, but you can t have everything. I would prefer playing at A for that reason.]
;B[oc]TR[ic]C[>Normally this is not a good idea because it makes the opponent stronger, however here it works because of the stone at j17]

(;W[kc];B[nd]C[>This shape is too good for black so normally instead of jumping white will extend]
;W[md];B[nb]C[> here you should just leave the o17 stone, and try to reduce the damage]

(;W[mc];B[ne]C[> black has a big corner and white didn't gain anything.so the invasion was a failure.]
;W[me]C[Very good for black I think...

>true];B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[>Here the contact play (tsuke) does not work.];B[fp]
;W[cn];B[jp]C[>Black now got a far superior result. White is absolutley confined to the left side and black has nice prospects on at least two sides.]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[qh]
(;B[qf]
(;W[qo]C[White Q5 is probably better. I should have let black take the corner ?

;W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[pl];W[om];B[nn];W[ql];B[nm];W[je]C[Trying to make life and work the lader on black Q8...

>for life an even lighter move would be better. or maybe a hane at o14.

There isnt' really a ladder problem here]
(;B[ie];W[ol]C[>This is helping black and you are not in trouble there]
;B[nl];W[ok]C[>This is almost forced];B[ng];W[nk]C[Going out...

>Why? Again it helps black more than you. That group is already alive and N17 group is not, it s better to tend to that first]
;B[cl];W[cj];B[el]
(;W[ej]C[Probably the wrong direction because black manage to get a huge moyo on south...

Maybe it was too late because black would have no problem joinning his stones North and still have a big moyo south...

>It was already big yes, also I'm not too sure if the other side would help you a lot.]
;B[en];W[gk];B[gl];W[fk];B[hl];W[on];B[oo];W[no]C[I had to invade but this is probably not the way to do it.
I tried to cut black but got into trouble.

Is White N3 better to invade ?
How do I invade this moyo, I cant let black take all this teritory...

> It may be a bit better, but it is very difficult for white to make a come-back I think.]

;B[iq];W[is];B[gq]LB[cd:A][de:B][nc:C][eq:D]C[fba75 has resigned the game.


> All in all, I think you lost the game because af three early mistakes. The play at A, followed by the answer at B, the invasion at C and the tsuke at D.
These moves became a burden for you as the made the opponent stronger and forced you to a single side.
Studying openings would be a good idea for you. ("In the beginning" by Ishigure Ikuro would be an easy book to read through as well as "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama)

I hope I helped you a little further in your progress, enjoy your future games.
