C[[A\] Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and won at the end just because fortunately I managed to capture a group due to to error of my opponent - otherwise I would have been lost.

The main focus is the bottom area - see specific questions inside.

I appreciate if you give me general advices about my style and what I should do to improve my game.

Thanks!];B[pp];W[cd];B[pd];W[dq];B[ed];W[hd];B[ef];W[cf];B[eh]
;W[ch];B[kd]C[[A\] [ guess so far is joseki - I felt that L16 work well with Q16]
;W[gg]LB[hf:A]C[[A\] I did not see this before - I saw the normal jump to H14. I decided to separate the 2 stone - was it a good decision?

You should cut at A.]
(;B[gf];W[hf];B[ge];W[he];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih];B[gh]LB[hi:A]
C[[A\] I thought this was the simplest to settle the left side, and now I could press the H16 group from the right. Please comment.

This result, white is better.

Black gained some points while capturing G13 but has strengthen white H16 group, can't satisfy with this result.

By the way, G12 at A better (capturing G13 in a larger scale).]
;W[ii];B[jf]LB[je:A]C[[A\] I am sure about this. I tried to force white into a bad shape.

White can choose to fight at A, which can be complicated.];W[if]
;B[kg]LB[pj:A]C[Tenuki better.

This move has little impact on J14 group.

A is a very good point.];W[pg]LB[nd:A]C[[A\] Now how to respond? Playing something like O16 would allow white to settle hiw Q13 stone with something like R10. May be this is better for Black than in the game, because then Black would respond with R8 and white will end up with 2 unsettled groups?

Black should be happy with A.

Did you realize w don't have much territory, besides top left corner?]
;B[qj];W[nd]C[[A\] I did not expect this. I suddenly realized that White aims to separate Q16 from L16. Is it that I did not find the proper follow up or the problems started with the previous plays?]
;B[oe];W[mf]
(;B[nf];W[me];B[ng];W[lh]C[[A\] Please comment on the following sequence. I have a strong feeling Black should have played differently.]

LB[oh:A][ni:B][ik:C][ke:D]C[Here, you should cut at A, if white B (you have already cut off Q13 in sente), black attack at C.

Need not to worry about cut at D, cos you can live on the side.]
;B[qf];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi]LB[ik:A]C[Slow move.

You should punish by play A.];B[nk];W[ik];B[lk];W[ke]
(;B[jp]C[[A\] Since the bottom almost certainly became White's, I tried to turn to top into territory. Is it the right placement?

No, you should try to save L16, look at the previous variation.

Bear in mind, whether a group live or die, is about 30 points difference, this is why tsumego is important.]

;W[qr];B[nq]LB[je:A]C[White should play A here.

Lower side isn't that big since the 3-3 is invaded (10 points discount).]
;W[jn]LB[je:A]C[[A\] The result with this play is that Black did not make a lot of points at the top. I feel that White is leading now in territory.

Yes, if you play A to live that side, will be another story.]
;B[ko]LB[jl:A]C[Slow move.

You should play A to cut locally, more pressure on white.];W[lm]
LB[jl:A][kn:B][il:C]C[Here, push-cut is crude moves.

You should play quiet move like A.

C[[A\] this is big. Should Black try before this to do something with L16?]

;W[fm];B[fl];W[je]C[[A\] It is at this point that Black can cut with K10. Strange that netither Black or White noticed it for until the end..
