C[Hello,

This is Nate (yip on IGS).  Hopefully I'll be able to lend some insights as to what happened.


[justinP\] I wonder how I got so behind in the middle game.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp];B[dj];W[fq]
(;B[cn]TR[hq]C[Opening with a sanrensai formation in the opening generally means that you are emphasizing influence over territory.  A pincer at the marked point or playing at the upper star point would work towards that goal.

The small knight's move is usually defensive.  You shouldn't mind if white enters the corner at this point - you can build solid thickness on the outside.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq]TR[br]C[This is submissive.  White can't do anything against B2.  Playing somewhere around J3 or H4 also looks interesting.

For the record, joseki would have White extend to J3 rather than play C2.]
;W[iq]TR[cn]C[The marked stone now looks a bit overconcentrated in relation to the rest of the stones in the corner.  It's not serving to secure much territory (White can still reduce at B2 or D8, for example).  Meanwhile, White has secured himself at the bottom.]
;B[jc];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[df];W[id];B[jd];W[ic];B[if];W[ie]
;B[je];W[hf]
(;B[eb]C[This is a mistake.  You secure the corner territory, but your stones in the upper center are severely weakened by White 26.  Capturing the white stones will be harder when your group isn't strong.

It's true that the corner can still be invaded, but if you secure a base for your group at the top, the white group will be too weak to do anything immediately.]
;W[mc]C[Now your stones can't get a base along the top, so they'll have to make eyes in the center somewhere.  They probably won't die, but notice that while you're scrambling around, White makes plays along the right side, improving his position.]
;B[jf];W[hh];B[jh];W[pj]C[This is probably a good time to take stock of the situation.  You have about 50 points of territory on the side, but that's it.  You may be able to expand that a bit in the lower right center if you can chase the white stones, but there's no potential for anything else.    Your stones are all on the left half of the board, while White's are distributed more evenly and are working together well.  He may only have about 10 points of secure territory, but should easily be able to make a lot more.

Barring a major mistake on White's part, it's hard to see how Black can secure much more territory than he already has.  The best thing to try at this point is probably to reduce the moyo at the top while strengthening the weak black group, then attempt to chase the weak White stones down the board into the other side of the moyo.]
;B[qf]C[Too deep.  You already have one weak group, and now you've given White an open invitation to make this stone heavy and then split the two groups.  Hold back to around P14.  Even if White defends the corner, It will probably still have potential.]
;W[qe];B[pf];W[nf]C[Good play by White.  Now you have to look after both groups.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[mh];B[oe];W[og]

;B[re];W[rd];B[se];W[oc]C[Without commenting too much on the fight, note what has transpired - you managed to save one group (and thereby got a small amount of additional territory), but White secured his corner and has almost built up a solid wall (he still needs at least one more move to help with all the cutting points).    Now the territory count is roughly Black 55-60, White 25, with White gaining a significant amount of potential in the corner.

Another invasion right now would be a bad idea; White's territory would become all but secure, and he would likely have significant thickness to invade the left side.]

(;B[lh]C[White probably appreciated this move a lot.  It helps eliminate a lot of aji.]
;W[mi]C[The cuts now no longer work, because White can connect his N11 group by cutting at M13.  On the other hand, M11 is now sente for Black.]
;B[ih]C[Good; strengthen this group by avoiding the strong White position, and hopefully you'll get the chance to reduce it further.  J11 would move out a bit more efficiently, though.  (As it is, you can't cut at G13 quite yet...)]
;W[lg]C[Not a good play.  You pretty much make your group safe now. If White really wants to attack, then L11 would be significantly more useful.]
;B[kg];W[lf];B[li];W[lj];B[kj];W[ki];B[kh];W[lk];B[jj]C[This group is essentially safe now.]
;W[ig];B[jg]C[Not necessary; White can't cut yet.  You can attack with G13, for example.]
;W[hg];B[hi]C[You're pushing White towards your moyo now, and also strengthening his group.  He can simultaneously reduce your territory and secure his stones with a move like E12, for example.]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[ik];W[hl];B[il]C[Now White is forcing you into *his* moyo.  These cutting stones aren't doing him any good.]
;W[gl]
(;B[kk]C[You're probably worried about the sequence starting with White J10, J11, K9, in which case you want to protect K9.  But this is an ugly shape which doesn't hurt White much.  L7 would be an excellent move to accomplish this, but even L8 or K7 would have more effect.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[km];B[in];W[dh]C[Either sealing off the lower right with something like K5 or securing the corner is much bigger.]
;B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[dg];B[cg];W[dk]
(;B[ck]C[Very submissive.  Look at the lower right; you have to secure more territory than that somehow (after you've presumably invaded at the 3-3 point).]
;W[ej];B[cj];W[dl];B[cl];W[dm];B[dn];W[cm];B[bm]C[Looking at the board now, you've actually accomplished your original goal when you had those stones along the left side; it's become black territory.  However, White managed to get all the forcing moves to reduce it by quite a bit.  In addition, he has actually gained some points in the process.

The result is that you probably should have resisted somewhere, attacking his stones in exchange for allowing him to break up the side.]
;W[en]C[Very small.]
(;B[nq]C[Good in ignoring White's previous move, but this probably isn't enough on its own.  By invading the corner directly, you still have the opportunity to reduce from the outside.  Alternatively, you might start reducing immediately, before giving White additional thickness.]
;W[np];B[qq];W[pq]C[This goes against playing the contact play in the first place, which is to try to secure the area above the two white stones.  If White wants the corner, he should play something like P3 instead of attaching.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq]
C[Not good at all for White; he needed sente to defend around K5.]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[io];W[ip]
(;B[ko]C[You don't need that stone anymore.  Sacrifice it and you can reduce White's territory.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[ll];W[lm];B[ml];W[mj];B[im];W[kp]LB[nc:a]
[sd:b][fg:c][lp:d]C[It's now in the endgame.  Looking at the territory count again, here's an estimate:

Black  left side - 40-45
center - 5
right side - 5
lower right - 5
Total - 60

White
upper right - 10-15 (T16 is a very big point)
left center - 10?  (Hard to say for sure)
lower/right side - 50
komi - 5.5
Total - 75

Note that this doesn't include the prisoner counts, which would add about 5 more to White's tally.  That's a lot to make up.

The biggest points I can see for Black are marked.  c might be an overplay, but if White doesn't make any mistakes, there's not much more to be done.

You might try d in the hopes that White misreads, too.];B[si]

[pn][po][qa][qb][qc][qd][qk][ql][ra][rb][rc][sa][sb][sc]C[The main thing I saw was that Black's stones were overconcentrated on the left side for the opening and start of the middle game.  They had little effect on the whole board, and allowed White to establish himself everywhere, with lots of potential.  White 34 was a big play, sepearting Black into two weak groups, but Black shouldn't have had to be in that position.

It's important to be able to back off of an attack in order to make a defensive move sometimes.  When  White extended along the top at move 26, the game went in his favor.  Compare it with the variation of Black extending.  From that move on, White had the initiative in the flow of the game, attacking the weak groups.

Another item to keep in mind is that the sanrensei opening emphasizes imfluence over immediate territory.  You should think about building a huge moyo, and forcing the opponent to invade or reduce, and in so doing, naturally acquiring territory.   Your plays in the opening were very territory oriented along the left side, but the 4-4 points don't secure it efficiently.  As a result, you used a lot of stones for relatively little gain.  You almost want the opponent to invade the corners early, so you can put your thickness that develops to maximum use.  Don't let yourself be confined.

I think your problem wasn't so much with the middle game as it was with the openng - that led to a difficult start to come back from.  Also try to make estimates of how much territory and potential each player has, so that you can act before it's too late.

Hopefully all this led to a few insights.  Good luck!])

You're ensuring White doesn't build up territory, and might even be able to attack his G8 stones enough to build a little more thickness with the J6 stone.]
