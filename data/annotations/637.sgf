C[DRS: What could I have done to keep black from geting such a
huge area on the left?

Well I have now gone through your game and you will see various
ideas I have thought of. Your strengths are to notice life and
death and to react well to situations where you have to either
live or kill your opponent.

I think two particular ideas will help your play. As a general
principle defense before attack. Defend always when your opponent
can so attack you that you might die. Once you are solid then
attack. Someone once told me only ever have one weak group. If
your move is not defending so you can live work out a way that
you can play a sente move. Often we think it is sente but in
the end our oponnent plays elsewhere but at the same time we
get something by them playing away. Look for the move that you
think your oponnent must respond to!!

Have a wonderful time playing and learning go.

n+1 point jump away from a wall of size n, but... I did one less,
and my opponent made life pretty easily.
 Yea see earlier comment ... the thing about Go is that no rule
always applies!!! .. better to play each stone as it comes. Here
the space is too much.

it didn't work for me (as can be seen soon).  Should I keep trying
with that rule?

Would a two point jump have been better in this situation?
 No this is fine .. but when black invades you need to play a
standard defensive response .. j4 is too attacking .. remeber
defense before attack];B[iq]

DRS: In retrospect...  Black didn't have that much outward facing
space along the sides, while I had a lot.  But it appears black
has been able to make much more of his "surface area".

What could I have done differently?

at various times in the game.])
