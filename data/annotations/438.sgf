(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[I would like to thank you for sending me  this game to review.
I'll try to be general and explain each strange term (moyo, aji, ...) i could use.

Sorry for the delay it took for me to review it, some personnal problems made the time longer than it should normally be, thx a lot for ur comprehension.]

LB[dd:A][dp:B]C[This 1st white move could bring some problems if black chose
to play 'a', white 'b'. In this situation the board is prospective territories of both sides are more difficult to find. White 'a' should be more easy to handle.]
;B[pj]C[This black move is strange, usually at the begining of the game, both side try to occupate the corners. Actually it's more easy to have a secure territory in the corner than on the sides]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[eg]LB[cn:A][jd:B][jq:C][dj:D]TR[dd]C[there, white should consider some of the points marked by a letter instead of E13.  E13 is not a good extension from the marked stone.
  - "a" is good because if black answer F4, white can "d" and make a good use of the triangle stone
  - "b" is good because it gives influence on all the upper side
  - "c" because it's in the middle of the prospective black territory (called a "moyo")]
;B[dj];W[dl];B[dk];W[el];B[fl]LB[fj:A][fk:B]C[i think that jmping out into the center at "a" or "b" would be better]
;W[mf]LB[fc:A][kc:B][nc:C]C[same remark as for E13, too high to make a territory, black could safely play a,b, or c for example]
;B[jj];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej];B[ei];W[fi]C[good cut but can become dangerous :)]

;B[aj];W[gl]LB[ch:A]TR[cg]C[i think here it's better for white to try to capture the invading black stones on the left with "a" for example (this also "protect" the upper corner from a black extension to the marked stone)]
;B[gm];W[dm];B[dn];W[fk];B[gk]LB[hl:A][fn:B]C[dangerous, this let white take f8 stone , treatening to go either to "a" or "b" after that, i think that the connection at F7 would have been better]
;W[fm];B[en];W[hl]C[see now black is in trouble in the center and the lower side is still open]
;B[fn];W[hj];B[dg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ef]LB[ci:A][cj:B][cg:C]C["a"  followed by black "b" white "c" would be better i think, killing nearluy surely black]
;B[df];W[cf];B[ce];W[cg];B[de];W[ci];B[cj];W[bh];B[bi];W[ch]C[now, black is dead]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec];W[bd];B[be]C[playing B15 is a mistake it makes possible for white  to connect at B17 as he will do]

  "when u attack, do it from far, when u defend play at contact"

here, "a" or "b" would be better.  "a" protect the corner while spoiling white from a base on the 3rd line  "b" threaten to link with his stone (M15) while making an extension from his other stone (Q10)]

;W[nq];B[op];W[mr];B[rq]LB[pr:A]C["a" is more effective here, it treatens both to take P10 or the two white stones]
;W[rr]C[mistake, just linking at Q2 woudl be enough, now black can play Q2 as he will do and take something]
;B[pr];W[ns];B[qr];W[mo];B[np]C[this is called a "thank you" move, it obliges white to play just where he wanted (N4) to connect his stones.]

"a" for example (treatening to invade the corner at R17 or to attack the 4 white stones at Q8)]
;W[ks]LB[qh:A]C[white is making litle moves, black can't be killed there and there are far much bigger points left on the board. "a" for example]

C[i hope my comments were usefull, sorry again for the delay

conclusion :

  - try to take key points making solid bases before attacking
  - while big points are left on the board don't play small moves
  - connect when the situation could be dangerous for you])
