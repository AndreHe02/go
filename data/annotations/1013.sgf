C[Comment: Andre Bergholz, 2K in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked with AB)]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[cj]LB[eq:A][ce:B]C[AB: I have never seen this move before. It is probably not too bad, but I would prefer a shimari at A. Then you will get either two shimari's or you can pincer a white kakari stone around B effectively.]
;W[eq];B[qn]LB[dn:A]C[AB: A seems to be a peaceful alternative.]
;W[ql];B[on];W[np];B[pl]LB[pk:A][qj:B][mn:C]TR[on][np]C[AB: This is probably a mistake. There is a joseki with Black playing at A. It gets kind of complicated, though. You could have played your move immediately without exchanging the marked stones. B and C are alternatives for you.]
;W[qk]LB[pk:A]C[AB: White can probaly hane at A.];B[pk];W[qj]
;B[pi]LB[pj:A][oj:B][oi:C][qm:D]C[AB: Up to this point the sequence on the right went quite well for Black. This move, however, seems bad to me. Just imagine White cutting with A an C (see variations). White's stones are in no immediate danger. Locally I would prefer A or the quite move at D, but the risky type of player can leave the situatuation as it is. White A is big, though.]

(;W[qo];B[qq]LB[rn:A]C[AB: Now this is the real mistake. A seems to be the only move here. You must, must, must keep White disconnected. Furthermore, A supports the invasion at 3-3.]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]C[AB: White has a big advantage now. Unfortunately, the strengths of the players are not given here, but a game between equally strong dan players would be over now.]
;B[rp];W[pq];B[ro];W[rr];B[qr];W[pr];B[qs];W[qh];B[ph];W[qg]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[pg];W[qf];B[rh];W[rj];B[pf];W[qe]TR[qo][pp][pq]
[pr][np]LB[lp:A][lq:B][gq:C][eo:D][dn:E]C[AB: White has a lot of territory now. My impression is that your only chance now is to put pressure on the marked stones. I would probably start at A or B. White can probably live with the stones, so the corner remains dead. You, however will get a strong position at the bottom, so later you can attack the E3 stone and grab territories at the bottom and on the left (imagine a sequence C to E).]
;B[sq];W[so];B[sn];W[rl];B[sk]TR[rh]C[AB: There is no use in trying this, because White always captures the marked stone.]
;W[hq]LB[kp:A][jp:B][jq:C]C[AB: Although I would prefer a move around A to C, your situation just got worse and close to hopeless.]
;B[dn]LB[lq:A]C[AB: An invasion around A seems to be your last chance, because you cannot catch up in territory by playing peacefully now.]
;W[lp];B[cg]LB[md:A]C[AB: Now it's not the time to secure small territories! Try A to set up a moyo. The upper side is more interesting than the left, because there is more potential.]
;W[jc]C[AB: Now White also gets the first move on the upper side.]
;B[mc];W[gc];B[de];W[nd];B[ld];W[mn]LB[me:A]C[AB: White should probably reduce your center influence from the upper side with a move around A. That would keep your two stones under attack.]
;B[pj]LB[mf:A]C[AB: That's a high price for your mistake in the beginning. It seems necessary, but you would love to play at A to get  the momentum on the upper side, wouldn't you?]
;W[nc]C[AB: White is obviously pleased with the situation and secures territory and victory now.]
;B[lf];W[ml];B[mj]LB[mg:A][id:B]C[AB: That's a bad reflex. There is not much territory to get there. Either solidly connect your groups with a move around A or be imaginative in the battle between the two groups on top by playing something like B.]
;W[ke]C[AB: Good timing!];B[le];W[cq]C[AB: Now White is entering the endgame and secures victory.]
;B[bq];W[br];B[bp]LB[dq:A]C[AB: Atari at A?];W[dq];B[dp];W[cl]
LB[fo:A][ec:B]C[AB: This is completely unnecessary! White A or B are just as big and riskfree.]
;B[dl];W[fo];B[fm]LB[ck:A]TR[cl]C[AB: Don't forget the marked stone. A would solve these problems, but a White stone at F7 is obviously very big.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[hj];W[fe];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[ge];B[ee]LB[ck:A][gb:B]C[AB: Is this so big? Good time to play A..., even capturing at B is big now.]
;W[fg];B[fi]LB[ck:A]C[AB: Now A is a must! There is not so much territory in the middle.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[bh];W[cm];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[al]LB[ai:A]C[AB: I am not really good at life-and-death problems. This looks like a standard form that you possibly can find in a book. I have added a couple of variations starting with A, and it seems that you can kill or at least get a ko.]
;W[bl];B[ak];W[am];B[bo];W[aj];B[ah];W[bk];B[jq]C[AB: Just because he had luck with a risky invasion you shouldn't do the same! You cannot run away with your stone, so living is your only option. It's not good to have only one option.]

C[AB: It's difficult to say something general at the end. Never use influence to make territory, but use it to attack instead. And never let your opponent link up groups so easily. Keep an eye on weak groups, both your own and your opponents. Giving the opponent many points in the beginning is not necessarily a problem, as long as you get potential and initiative or some other equivalent. Try to think strategically (see move 38).
