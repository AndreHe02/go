C[Hi

I comment the game from the Black perspective, but I will also remark and give basic notes about important White's moves.
My analysis contains both comments for the specific moves but also variants. Most of the times I am starting a variant to show a different approach, not necessarily better.

Hope you'll enjoy
Radu];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[pk]TR[gc][jd][jp][gq]C[R: This fuseki looks a little bit as a chinese fuseki. B has now to focus on up and down side and only restrict access of W on right side. B aims for the triangled spots.]
;W[qh]
(;B[qi]C[Is this the right move? Alternative is R13?

R: First, W attack is premature. It gives B the chance to gain strength on W's time. Please see variants.

But this move (also r13) is bad because is doing exactly the opposite: makes W strong on B's time. Not to mention the old saying: don't attack in contact, defend in contact. I am not sure why this saying, but maybe because indeed the invader is lacking power and contact attack forces him gaining power.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[pd];W[pe];B[nd];W[ri];B[qj]C[R: still ok]
;W[ph];B[jp]CR[qo]C[Is K4 the right move, or should I play at R6 to protect the RHS?

R: yes, the r10 group is out flanked. It isn't yet dying, but a W invasion between would force B fight for life, making easy for W to gain extra power.
Not to mention the teritorial gain. I would play r5 in this situation.]
;W[qn]C[The black stones in the center are now trapped

R: I would say the r10 group is "threatened". Before seeing the continuation, I developed a possible even continuation.]

(;B[qo]C[R: the contact attack. This isn't good at all. W gains power and B has to start defending its part.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[on]
(;B[nl]C[R: the intention (pull the B group outside and out flank W group) is very good, but don't do it with kogeima (in this situation) simply because r10 group isn't living yet. Please see variant.
Use kogeima to trap (surround) a group and kosumi to escape. In this case, escape and trap same time, I wouldgo with something solid.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[qk];B[pj];W[pl];B[ol];W[pm];B[nq];W[mo];B[lp]
;W[kn];B[kl]C[R: too far. W can cut.];W[ll];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk]
;W[kk]C[R: and W cut.];B[kj];W[jk]CR[nj]C[R: there are many aji in B formation. Sometimes, look after them and spend a move to close them, later it will help.]
;B[jj];W[ik];B[ed]LB[jc:A][dg:B][cj:C]C[R: it is an important move. Other moves: see letters. And these are my choices ordered.
A- actually your move invites W to go here and make real damage. A is making a good extension an dprovides suppport for the B central group.
B- is also providing support for B central group and followed by other important moves, it will bring much wealthy.
C- usual invasion, it is not quite helping central group, but it could work.
Anyway, e16 (or e17, f16 etc) wouldn't be one of the first choices.]
;W[hd]C[What's the best reply here now for black?
R: I didn't know that this is following when I previously draw the labels spots. 
I would keep my initial thinking: k17 (or k16 rather, h16 is high too).  The ajis of teh central group are still here.]
;B[jd]C[R: good];W[hf]
(;B[df]C[Is this the right move?
R: It's ok, because this double kakari is actually strong one.
Other variants:
- B can actually use e16 as aji and go on left.
- also, B would have c17 to go on.];W[cb];B[ig]CR[kg]C[R: I think this is too close to W formation. Also, c12 looks better.]
;W[hg];B[hi]CR[ii]C[R: too weak relations between stones! How about j12?]
;W[ii]C[R: and W sees also the move.];B[ij];W[jh];B[ih];W[ji]

(;B[jg]CR[lj][nk][ok]C[R: wrong move. If until now the central B group was not in immediate threat, now it is. The cutting points: circles. See variation.]

(;W[kh]C[R: hm, W misses the chances to finish B group.];B[li]
;W[lh];B[nh];W[mh];B[mi];W[ng];B[oh]C[R: looking at the variation started with move 59, the result is similar, with 2 majors differences:
- actually W missed the chance of capturing B
- B still has the ajis unprotected.];W[mf];B[og];W[of];B[ne]
;W[nf];B[le];W[lf];B[ie]C[R: good closure with this sente sequence]
;W[he];B[cn]CR[ed][df]LB[ce:B][ch:A][di:C]C[R: again it is an invitation to make pincer. And looking how weak iti is the double (circle stones), this look rather awful. Again, I labeled the choices.]
;W[cl]C[R: Yeah, it was obvious.];B[cj]C[R: good, but still far! why not d11 for instance?]
;W[el];B[fq];W[co];B[dr];W[cq];B[be]C[R: the area and the intention good, but again leave no choice to W  but to attack the weakest stones. Again the use of kogeima in wrong situation.]

(;W[ce];B[cf];W[de];B[ee];W[ef]C[R: B should be happy at least has some living group there! W attack could be even severer. (see alternatives started with move 85)]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[fg];W[fd];B[dh];W[cr];B[dq];W[jf];B[if];W[ke]
;B[kd];W[me];B[ld]C[R: I would respond with n16 instead this move. The ko is not worthing only one point, but keeps B connected!]
;W[md];B[mc];W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[R: o16 still lost. This makes W invasion unstoppable! Should connect directly at p16.]

(;W[id];B[je];W[kb];B[mb];W[jc];B[ob]C[R: only luck prevented W makes more damage... W missed lot of chances.]

;B[oq];W[nm];B[rh];W[rg];B[si];W[pg];B[oi]C[R: why not q11?]

;B[io]C[R: almost same value: 6 points]
(;W[ho]C[R: oh nooo! wrong.];B[jn];W[in]
(;B[jo]C[R: oh noooo! see variation.];W[jm];B[im];W[hn];B[kq]
;W[pi];B[oj]C[R: no need.];W[tt]C[R: Overall, I didn't see too many wrong moves. That's great.

The most important: you should spend more time when playing fuseki. It is the most important part of the game. All the trouble you had are originated in the bad choices made during fuseki. Actually, your moves invited the opponent to play strongly and dangerous for you. When choosing the kakari, or invasion in the middle of a side, or strengthening one of your groups, try see what would be the usual development. What would be best opponent move. Don't go blindly in the sequences. Fuseki especially is important, and in online games, try to use all your time in fuseki.

Also, be more attentive to your group's weak points. The cutting points are especially important. And when defend, try to defend as simple as you can and with the immediate goal of retaking sente.

Try to see the groups on the table. Try to see which ones are surely alive, which are not yet surely alive and which ones are there to die. While aiming for territory, don't miss the status of the groups.

Choose your tactical approaches carefuly, according to the local situation. Always consider the 3 basic moves: kosumi, ikken tobi and kogeima.

I hope you enjoyed my comments,
