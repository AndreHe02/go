C[Hello dear reviewer, I am white in this game, I marked my Questions with OD, though I hadn't many because I am unsure why I lost, it was a close game, so I hope I can get new ideas from your review for improving my game :-)

Hi OceanDrop, my name is Gus. Her's a summary of the game for you.

You played good opening moves, but then both you and your opponent failed to see the best move for black. Study the sequence I show you, because it is very useful midgame joseki. Through most of the game your mistakes and his (her?) mistakes were fairly equal. Many moves were slow and seemed like automatic reactions. Both of you need to work on asking yourselves if you really need to respond. Try to have the move you really want to make in mind at all times and every move ask yourself if you can make it. 

You got behind but then invaded and had a good lead, until one of these slow moves allowed B to invade You saved a single stone at f15. This stone is not a cutting stone, so you should have been asking yourself, is there anything out there worth more than 2-3 points? 

Every time your opponent threatens a single stone a little bell should go off in your head and you should do the following:
1. Check if it's a cutting or killing stone. 
2. Check if the move has some other meaning or use (is your opponent sneaky, as he was in this case.
3. Find a bigger move 

2 and 3 apply for ANY move that feels slow. My favorite way to come back from a deficit is to find a move that looks just slightly slow but has a real threat behind it and then find a sequence that makes it look natural... Sente Yose, Sente Yose, Sente Yose, small yose that is actually a subtle threat and might be mistaken for gote... for example  :).]

;B[rq]C[OD:
I found this black move a bit Small, I thought about playing at C14, D10 or R12, in the end I played R12, because I thought if he does a second local move, why shouldn't I.

Gus: I agree with your assesment that this move is too early. I think all of those moves are playable. The move you chose says "I'm going to be solid, and if you try to make a moyo I'm going to be able to invade it safely. (because I have no weak groups. It also prevents black from making a good lextension at R11 or r12.]

[bd][cd][ae][be][ri][si][rj][sj][rk][sk][rl][sl][rm][sm]C[OD:
This formation feels good for black, what did I do wrong? Should I invade after black plays J16? In the game I thought M17 was slow, but now it looks nice to me.

Gus:

Black actually seems a bit slow. The black upper side is a bit over concentrated, and most of the stones are on the third line. Not that easy to develop. Probably  approaching the corner or A is the next move for black 

Balance of the game:

Black 32 points + some potential in the center (27 marked but it hasn't happened so cut it in half for about 14 points... this would be realized by a black play at A, see var) 

Black ~46 points

White 24 points + 6.5 points komi + sente (maybe 18pts now?) + unopposed corner (10 pts)

One could view white as leading, but that hinges on white finding an efficient move!]
;W[fq]C[Good! This denes black the most efficent corner approach Blac should now play q10.]

I played C8, but it became a bit weird, maybe a different answer is better?]

;B[en];W[el];B[bp]C[OD:
Now I feel like I did something wrong, if I answer at C3 what I did, that black had the initiative/sente and could immidieatly invade my potential territory at the left side with D8 or D9 or something.]
;W[cq];B[bq]C[OD:
Maybe better to answer it at B2?

Gus: Yes. weak groups with 1 eye are -10 pts]
(;W[fe]C[OD:
It feels like I am asking for too much, what have I done wrong to end up here? If I answer instead of playing F15, still playable?
