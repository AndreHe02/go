C[catch22: I am hoping you don't mind reviewing this game.

I am White in this game. The way I see it, I got a bad start, and was fighting an uphill battle from then on. Still, I think it was an interesting game, with hopefully enough to comment on.

I've annotated the game with some of my thoughts and questions. I am hoping you can answer most of my questions, but feel free to comment whenever you feel that there is an important point to be made

Thanks.

jos: Hi, I reviewed your game. My comments are preceeded by "jos".
It is true that black came out of the opening with an advantage but the game was still far from over. You missed some chances for more active continuations during the middle game and could have gotten some more points during the end game. Try to avoid heavy stones.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[ce];W[cp];B[ep]C[catch22: What is a good way to play for White now? Maybe D6? I considered playing E3 but did not like the result (see variation). However, the result in the game was definitely poor.


jos: E3 would not have been a bad joice. See comment on your variation.]

(;W[hp]C[catch22: I played a pincer, as I wanted to separate Black's stone at E4 from the one at Q4. Is this a good idea, or not?


jos: a pincer is possible but there is no clear advantage over the E3 atachment. The var. shows one possible continuation. You have to be prepared to treat H3 lightly.]

(;B[cm]TR[do]C[jos: C7 is interesting. I haven't found this move as a joseki but it is hard to answer.
 D5 is the only continuation that I have found in a professional game.  Keeping the two b stones separated should be a priority]

(;W[eq]C[catch22: Maybe it would have been better to separate the two Black stones by playing at E5 instead?

jos: the problem with E3 is that it hurts H4 if you force b to defend E4.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn]C[catch22: I don't like this move, but at this stage I am not sure if there is a better move. I think this means I should not have played this variation?

jos: I agree.]
(;B[dn]C[jos: I think b D7 would have been better]
(;W[do]C[catch22: I thought I could separate the Black stones, but misread the situation.

Should I simply have played B6 instead? This would allow Black to connect and get good shape by playing E7, but that cannot be helped?

jos: the crosscut at D7 seems to be better. It leaves more bad aji for b to worry about.]
;B[en];W[eo];B[fo]C[catch22: I was hoping to cut at F6, but don't think this works, as Black will play D4 and then cut at C3.

jos: I agrre. See var.]
(;W[bn];B[fm];W[bm];B[cl]C[catch22: I think I got a very poor result here :-(]
;W[gn];B[fn];W[ed]C[catch22: Although this gives Black a large corner, if I played D17 instead, Black would get even more influence.

jos: seems to be good reasoning];B[dc];W[ec];B[db];W[jd]LB[ef:A]
[eg:B]TR[ic]C[jos: as b' response shows, the placement of K16 is doubtfull.

You should either play the joseki move at J17 or consider the two stones as forcing moves and play somewhere else, e.g. at  the right side
Alternativelly  w can consider playing a or b in order to limit b's territory on the left side.]
;B[gc]
(;W[eb]LB[ef:A]TR[pj][qj]C[catch22: I played here to separate the Black stone from the corner, but I am not sure if that was wise. I am not really in a position here to pick a fight. Maybe I should have played G16 to build some influence myself?

jos: the E18 stones are ultra heavy and a perfect target for attack. Litely jumping out at A seems better. It gives w E17/E18 a good chance to run away and flatens out the left side. B G17 seems premature.
 I would even consider leaving them for the time beeing and playing on the right side on a point like A10 or R10.]
;B[ge];W[ef];B[de]
(;W[hd]C[jos: ignoring the beep gives b a fine result. The variations show some sharp fighting variations. The leitmotiv will be the survival of the E18 stones.]
;B[ee];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc];B[fe];W[gb]C[catch22: Another poor result for White? Black got the corner and build a wall...]
;B[bl]
(;W[if]TR[qi][qj]C[jos: J14 is a good move when there are two adjacent moyos. The only problem is that there is no w moyo yet and b could prevent w from getting one by playing at R10 or R11, creating a second moyo at the same time. See var. on the last move.]
;B[gh]C[jos: seems like b is too concerned about territory. I would prefer R11.]
;W[qj]C[jos : good];B[kp];W[ih]TR[qn]C[catch22: This helps me to build a mojo myself, but maybe it's a bit slow?

jos: R6 is huge since it is big for both sides to play on the ride side. Imagine b playing R8.]
;B[hm];W[in]C[jos: R6 is huge!];B[im];W[kn];B[jm];W[ko];B[jp]

(;W[io]TR[gn][in][hp]C[catch22: I probably should have played M4 instead? The three marked stones are not so important, and they still have some aji. I am now making myself heavy and make it too easy for Black to get territory at the bottom.

jos: I agree. The pattern here is the same as in the upper left corner. W is creating a heavy group that b can attack while makiing territory at the same time. M4 would have been quite nice for w.]
;B[mp];W[lm];B[nc]
(;W[pc]C[catch22: Is this the best reply?

jos: Q17 seems playable. I would also consider P17, a standart move in this kind of situations. It makes O17 heavy and leaves it with poor eye shape]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[ob]
(;W[ne]C[catch22: I considered the corner less important than continuing building my mojo.]
;B[qb];W[pb];B[pa];W[rc];B[qc]
(;W[qd]C[jos: alternatively you could have gone for the kill. This is a risky strategy but considering that w is behind anyway, this could have been an option here.]
;B[rb];W[rd];B[sb];W[qn]C[catch22: I was happy to play this move. Maybe I could still get back into the game...

jos: better late than never...];B[ro]
(;W[qo]C[catch22: I was not sure how to reply to Black's move at S5. I want to keep Black out of my mojo, but do not want to give him too big a corner either. Is better way to reply, that still leaves some aji in Black's corner for me to exploit?


jos: wrong direction. See var.

S5 seems lose and greedy but without support from the other side, there is not much w can do about the b corner.]
;B[qp];W[rn];B[on]C[catch22: Oops... I was hoping Black would reply at S4, but obviously this is a much better move. It looks difficult now to keep Black out of my territory without harming my weak group at the bottom.

jos: You should never expect your opponent to answer like you want him to answer. If you were in his place, would you play a  gote endgame move when there is still a moyo to invade?]
;W[om];B[nm];W[ol];B[nl];W[lk];B[ok]TR[nk]C[jos: O9 would have been enough]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[no];B[oo];W[mm];B[np];W[nk];B[mo];W[ml];B[pm]
;W[pl];B[pn];W[ql]C[catch22: I don't think I can be unhappy with this result. Where did Black go wrong?]
;B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[lf];B[hj];W[jj]TR[ij]CR[iq]C[jos: consider J10. If b answers, w gets a chance to reduce the lower side, e.g. at J3.]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[hq]C[catch22: That's a big move. I was hoping to play here myself. I made a mess of my reply. Any suggestions how I should have played instead?

jos: since the var. doesn't work, there wasn't much w could do. Laocally J14 was better.]

;W[am];B[bk];W[dd];B[cd]
(;W[da]C[jos: this is an interesting situation.  W C5 like in the variation would have reduced the b territory by 3 more points but ended in gote. In order to outweigh a sente move, a gote move has to have twice the value- so if w postpones the sequence until he has played out all the other sente moves, it could become more profitable to take gote here.
But I am afraid I am too weak at yose to answer that question.]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[cc];W[gg];B[fg]
(;W[gf]C[jos: too passive. Crosscutting at G12 allows w to reduce the b territoy. Since w is behind, he should use any possibility to pick up a fight.

Actually, depending on b' answer, this could have been the chance for a turnaround.]
;B[ff];W[hh];B[gi]
(;W[lc]C[catch22: I wanted to do something here, but I am not sure if this is the best place to start. Maybe playing one higher (at M18) instead would have been better?

jos: yes, L18 or m18 would have been better.];B[lb]
(;W[kd]TR[kb]C[jos: why not pick up a stone with L18 and close off the territory around J18?]
