C[P:Hi. Sometimes I dont know well if its time to attack or to make my group more solid

C: Hi. I will start all my coments with "C:" and hope I can help you with this review. I'll answer your questions as good as I can and comment some moves which jumped to my eye.]

;B[nd]TR[pf][qf]C[P: Till now I think everything is OK

C: In my opinion you have a slight advantage because of the marked stones aren't optimal for white.]
;W[qi]LB[qh:A][oi:B]C[P: I think this move is too close to my stone. I dont know if I should have answered q11

C: It is. White should have played at A or maybe something like B. Q11 is really better than Q10 (see variations)]
(;B[pj];W[pi]C[P: ShouldI attack wit o14 for example or o11? o11 doesnt map any moyo. Is R11 weak enought to attack it?

C: P11 would be my choice. See variation.]

[ep:B][gp:E][hq:C]C[C:White at A is normal joseki. Maybe you should punish him first. If you want to punish a wrong joseki, try to thing about the aim of the joseki at all, how the stone he didn't play works and what the move he played does.
The general idea of th joseki he played is to build influence to both direction. The stone at A connects B and C. However, this joseki is only recommended if there is a stone at D. If there is no stone black can simply play there and limit the influence to this direction. To prevent this white choosed to play C7.
So black at D is what white wanted to be a bad move. This might not be ne very good, but I think you should play at E first. Maybe you get sente and you're able to play D as well.]
;B[dj];W[ck];B[cj];W[dk];B[dh];W[dg]LB[ch:B][eh:A]C[A is better than B because it prevents that white gets influence.]

(;B[iq]LB[gp:A]C[P: I dont know well if this has been a good move. IÂ´ve managed to live there but maybe it has been because of his fault.

Sometimes I manage to make sabaki in situations like this and sometimes not. Its difficult for me to know when a move like this is good or not

C: Is still prefer A. White should have answered with B (see variation)]

C: I think you should try to play some (very) slow games and think about your attacks some minutes. Besides you can replay commented games of stronger players (from gtl or other sources) and take a look at their attacks.
I hope this review helped you a little bit. If you have any questions, just send me a message.

Good luck and have fun,
