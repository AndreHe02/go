C[Hi. I am SaurusDNA, 7 kyu on DGS, and I was playing black against a 6 kyu player with no komi.
(Time: 25 minutes + 5x30sec byo-yomi)

I feel I started well in this game, but I had no idea how to handle white's invasions.

I believe that my defense is lacking, and I am hope that this review will teach me a little more about how to defend against invasions.

I have also asked a few specific questions where I had no idea what to do.

;W[cd];B[fq]C[I don't mind if white cuts at w-d14, since I plan to play at b-q10, building a big moyo.

Okay, but you do need a plan for these stones: how are you going to use them? They would work well with a kakari at C6, for instance, but there are other possibilities.]
;W[df]
(;B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[This is the wrong side: you're stronger on the right than on the bottom, given white's D4.]

(;B[om]C[Here, I wondered if b-p7 was too slow, and I considered b-j4, but then there was no point in giving up the corner for the wall in the first place.

I think P7 is okay. J4 leaves a lot of aji, and looks a bit overconcentrated. I find it difficult to decide between the two, however.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hp]C[Up to here, I think I did well, and the board is still even, but this is where white started to invade, and devastated my moyo.

Remember that a moyo is not territory, it's potential. Invasions are to be expected.]
;W[nr];B[os]C[Should I have connected here. Would b-r8 have been better?

No, this is good. You want to make it as difficult as possible for white. R8 is submissive.]
;W[no]
(;B[oo]C[Is there a better way to connect?

See variation.];W[mp];B[lp]C[I was reluctant to allow the white tiger's mouth at w-m6, but didn't see a better move.

It's not that bad, since it works well with H4.];W[lo];B[ko]

See variation.];W[nn];B[mm];W[mo];B[nm];W[qm];B[pm]C[You're doing fine so far: you have good thickness, the bottom group is reasonably big (although it is open at m1/2) and W's bottom group has no eyes.]

I would like to know how I could improve my defence, and if you have any suggestions for any areas where I may improve.

Many thanks

I think you need to think in terms of attack rather than defense. A moyo is not territory: it is prospective territory. Expect to be invaded, and then make it is hard as possible for the opponent, all the while making real territory. Turn the invasions to your advantage. Keep your opponent from getting eyes, and keep him from connecting.
