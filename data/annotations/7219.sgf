C[mlansman:

Thank you so much for this review in advance.

My play deteriorated from w138 onwards, as I ran out of time and was on sudden death, so I'm less concerned with my numerous endgame mistakes.

I'm particularly interested in move b97 and my response at w98: I felt that this was a big mistake and a turning point in the game, I didn't really know what to do so I panicked.

Sorry, I have asked a lot of questions, feel free to give short answers to those that you don't think are important.

All the best,
mlansman

Hi miansman,

It's good for you to ask questions, in fact I think you'll stand to learn more from your own questions than my answers. I'm only 4k and I'm only playing on KGS, no real Go lessons whatsoever, so my knowledge will be quite limited. I'll try my best to answer your questions though!

Cheers!
Lib];B[pq];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[jp]C[This is a weird opening for black. As a general rule of thumb, try to make sure your komokus are facing yourself, not the opponent, unless you are sure you can defend it in sente. But in the opening, almost any move can be playable. In this case, white can attack black from both sides, so white should gain some advantage, but the K4 stone is troubling...]

(;B[di]C[mlansman: I thought this was a terrible move, did I punish correctly with D9?

It looks like a terrible move, but I guess black has his own plans for it...
Usually the stone should prevent white from establishing a base on the left, and the punishment would be that black's corner is sealed off. There is nothing wrong with your response considering his stone is so far away, but you might want to consider the variations, perhaps later when you get sente.]
;W[dk]C[looks like an excellent response to me...];B[cf];W[ce]

;B[cj]
(;W[ck]C[This is a very defensive move. I wouldn't say its bad, it depends on your style of play. But you could also consider the variation where you give up territory on the left and go for influence (which makes the corner even easier to attack), since your D9 stone is on the 4th line and not the 3rd anyway. (generally 4th line = influence, 3rd = territory)]

(;B[ak];W[al];B[bi];W[eq]C[mlansman: was this the biggest move? With hindsight I now think it may have been better to play elsewhere, as I was already strong in this area.

Nope, this is a great move. With such strength on the left, killing the corner may even be possible]

technically it is the correct punishment for black to not play D14. But since the D11 stone is quite high up anyway (so it'll be difficult for you to seal him in), I would prefer to play F16 first.]
;B[cg];W[jd];B[ec]
(;W[ed]C[mlansman: would D17 have been better? I decided to play for influence, but looking back I think D17 would have been much more severe.

There is too much space for black to live, so E16 might be an overplay. Yes, D17 might have been better.]

Ouch. at the end of all the joeskis on the left, black has 2 corners and positions at the left and bottom side, while white only has positions on the left and top side. The black corner at the top is quite big...

actually the D13 move might not be sente...];B[dh];W[po]C[mlansman: was this the best approach? Was it right to make a kakari now?]

(;W[og]C[mlansman: was this the right defence: I aimed to make territory behind, should I have been more aggressive?

Actually this move was too aggressive. the invasion at 3-3 is still available, so perhaps R14 would be better (defending in sente)]

This move serves a dual purpose of expanding your moyo and threatening to seal black in. F13 would have too too lax.]

Its an OK choice. A play around K6 would have been bigger, but if the black R12 group leaks out into the center, the result is still quite small for white.]

Yes, the black K7 area is a lot more open than the F10 area. given a choice, you should ahve picked K7.]
;B[jm]
(;W[io]C[mlansman: This is a big issue for me that often comes up in my play: I don't know how to respond to reductions like these. I cannot decide to go head on with a cut at K6, or play more defensive like K9, so I ended up playing a deeply irrational move at J5 out of desperation!

What was the right move here, and in general how should I play in situations like this?

Is there anyway I could have avoided this situation from arising in the first place?

As they say, prevention is better than cure. But if that fails, the best defence is a good offense. A play around K9 is wayyyyyy too slow. By continuing his attack, he will also build up enough strength to make sure he doesn't get cut off.

this is a weird move, though... it helps black solidify the K7 stone

In general, when the opponent reduces you, try to counter attack, but while doing so, make sure that the battle doesnt escalate to the extent that if you lose the battle the entire center is gone (unless he plays a stupid move, in which case an all-out counter attack would be justified). If countering is not possible/disadvantageous, find a key spot to sacrifice a stone and cut off the invading stone. If all else fails, defend, but that should be the last resort.]
;B[jo];W[in];B[jn]
(;W[jj]C[mlansman: K9?

now that he is strong enough thanks to the J5-6 exchange, a K9 will be too close. You might also consider J9, which also defends the bottom left (which is one of your objectives, I'm sure, since you played J5-6)]
;B[ll];W[hl];B[im];W[hm];B[ip];W[bp]C[mlansman: biggest move?

maybe. I was considering something around P3 or O4. It threatens his territory while breaking his territory in the center.]

Score estimate gave me +53.5 on move w138 when I realised I was on sudden death, I only won by only 3.5 in the end.

What were my most important mistakes in the w138-w228 period? I'm less interested in general points about this period, as I say I was rushing due to sudden death so my play wasn't on form.

Do you have any general comments about my play up untill w138?

Thank you so much!
mlansman

In general, your play is quite stable. You seem unacquinted with the possiblility of guerrilla warfare. Sometimes it is better to throw a random piece into a key spot and then sacrifice it. Your play seems more focused on keeping all your stones connected to a living group. A glaring example would be moves 98 and 100 (J5-6).

From your fuseki and yose, you should be a lot better than 8k. Try to improve your fighting techniques so that you'll be more confident when your pieces are not connected together. This will help your middle game by leaps and bounds. Your move-by-move analysis of which is the biggest move is a very good habit, work on it, but keep in mind that urgent moves are more important, and try not to spend too much time on it.

Black's play was also somewhat slow sometimes, allowing you advantages where there shouldn't be. Move 16-17 is an example. learn to give up such 6 point stones. It gives you 2 sente moves.

Oh and the score estimate is next to useless. I was using it throughout the review. the reason it said you were leading by 50+ is because it doesn't take into account invasions/reductions. Black's estimate will be quite accurate, since its all solid territory, but for white its all very wishy-washy. Thus after the reductions, your lead is actually very small, as you can see.

Thats about it.

Cheers!

However, white is also unable to strike in anytime soon, or white will end up in a tough fight. White will have to build up strength and influence before he can do so, hence while this opening can be disadvantageous to black, it also puts a burden on white.

point in case: this is a possible variation to play out, though the K4 stone can be both a blessing and a curse.]
