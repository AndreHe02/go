C[TF: I would be appreciated a review of this game I recently played in the Leksand Open in Sweden. Altough I won this game I felt I made some mistakes in the opening and early middle game (please see my questions).


Here is a summary of what happens in the game.

First, your choice of pincer in the bottom left may not be the very best move, although it cannot really be called a mistake.

Then you do make a mistake in the top left corner, which makes things a bit easy for black.

Then after black invades on the left, you don't manage to attack very effectively. When you attack, try to have some purpse meyond just attacking. 

Eventually, we reach the start of the endgame, and white is a little bit behind, but white plays good endgame, and black plays badly, and so white unsets black's lead.

Actually, the game is fairly close throughout, no player gets a long way ahead of the other.

There is more detail in the comments on the individual moves.


So, white needs to study the opening, and black needs to study the endgame :-)

Good books on opening theory are "Opening Theory made Easy" and "In the Beginning" (do not be afraid to study simple books. They are full of good advice which a lot of dan players still do not know).

Then "Get Strong at the Opening" has lots of problems to let you practice the theory.

If you want to know more about which joseki to choose, "The Great Joseki Debates" is good, as is "Whole Board Thining in Joseki".

I hope you find my comments useful.

Tim.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jq]C[So far so good.]
;B[lq]LB[fc:A]C[Is this really the biggest move?

Sure, it is an extension in front of a shimari, pretty big, but A is also very big. I like A better.]
;W[jo]LB[nc:A][jd:C][dj:B]C[Again, is this the  biggest move? What about A or B or C?]

(;W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em]TR[do][jo][dp][dq]
[jq]C[I think that black is a little bit happier now. 

Black finishes in sente, and the marked white stones only make about 20-25 points of territory. Is that enough using 6 stones?

Still, the game if very close.];B[fc]C[Good move by Black.


TF: Which joseki has white to chose in consideration the whole board?

The move you play is not joseki.

Look at the variations for two common ideas.]
(;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[jd]TR[ec]C[This is why your marked move is not joseki. 

Black's last move is perfect. It is the ideal distance from the top right corner, and the proverb recommends "extend 3 from a 2 stone wall, which is what black has just done.

See the variations for a bit more explanation.]
(;W[qf]C[OK. R10 is also worth considering.];B[re]C[TF: What about this move (B S15) ?

This is a good strong move. 

Sometimes a move like this in an overplay - too dangerous, but here all the nearby stones are black so it is probably OK.

A black pincer would also be a good move.];W[mc]C[TF: Is W N17 as response ok?

Yes. Since, S15 is low on the second line, white can think "the R14 - S15 exchange was a forcing move" and leave it for now.

Black would like white to make the stone R14 into a weak group that he can attack, so white should not do that. White should play flexibly instead, like you are doing.]
;B[qi];W[jb]C[Good];B[ic]C[This is very timid by black.];W[kc]
;B[oc]C[Sometimes black can play O18 instead of P17 in this sort of position.]
;W[le]C[I think that the game is now quite even. Both sides have one weakish group at the top, and both sides have one big area of territory.]
;B[ch]C[This is not very good. Black already has one weak group at the top. So to make another weak group nearby is very dangerous. White should try to start a splitting attack, then black will be in big trouble.]
;W[cg]C[This is not good. 

You want to attack this black stone. You don't attack with contact moves.

There is another technical reason too. See the variations.]

(;B[bg];W[bf];B[dg]LB[eh:A]C[It is more stylish for black to just play at A, and to keep the atari in reserve. That leaves more options open.]
;W[cf];B[cj];W[eg]C[At least you are now starting to separate the two black groups in a splitting attack.]
;B[dh];W[ek]LB[dl:A]C[Mistake.

This does not stop black from connecting his weak stones with the corner. You needto play at A instead.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[bl]
(;W[jf]C[TF: What about attacking the top left group?
 I dont feel satisfied with the result i got.

Attacking the weak black group seems like a good plan, but why are you attacking? what do you hope to get out of it?

Common ideas:

Attack to kill - normally a mistake, it does not work.

Attack to make territory - normally a very good idea, when it is possible.

Attack to make thinkness - good, provided to you can use the thickness for something.

Anyway, you should know why you are attacking before you start. That will help you to choose an attacking move.]

(;W[ef]C[This is too timid. See variation.];B[ed];W[dc];B[hf]
;W[oi]LB[qk:A]TR[hf][gg]C[TF: I think W P11 is not good.
 It sems W M5 is better?

Well, to make a plan, you really need to know what the blance of territory is. 

White in the top left, and black in the bottom left are both about the same. 

The white and black groups at the top are both about the same. 

Se the question is, which is bigger, black's right side or the white area at the bottom plus komi?

I think that the black area on the right is bigger, so white should probably invade.

(The other plan would be for white to make more territory in the middle, but that is not really possible any more becuase of the marked black stones.)

Where to invade? I think I would try A.];B[lo]LB[pk:A]C[This is strange. If I was black, I would play A]
;W[pk]C[Good.

You could also try R10.];B[pm];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf]TR[qd][qe]C[Better not to have made the marked exchange. See variation.]

(;B[qk];W[pl]C[This is an OK idea.];B[ql];W[om];B[pn]
(;W[jj]LB[lm:A]C[This move is not very good. It does not really surround anything. What if black jumps to A?

I prefer the sequence in the variation.];B[hi];W[hk];B[of];W[ph]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[kn];W[im]C[I think that white has now lost.

Estimating the score:

White:

Top left: 15
Top side: 5
Bottom: 30
Middle: 10? but probably less.
Komi: 5

Total: 65


Black:

Left side: 15
Top: 5
Top right: 10
Bottom right: 40

Total: 70

Well, that is a bit closer than I thought, but still, difficult for white, and black has sente.]
