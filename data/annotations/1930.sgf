Andre: Hi, this is a real-life game I played in a recent tournament. Due to time constraints I did not record it to the end. I won in the end due to a mistake of my opponent in the endgame, without that it would have been very close. I felt I played patiently, but somehow I have the feeling that my opponents strategy of "grabbing territory whenever possible" would have almost worked out.]

R:Instead of 8, C or * wolud be select, for w6 is  attacked by bA <then  wB and b* or bC>]
;B[df];W[pj]C[
In this case w8 is attacked by the same method w6.];B[qf]C[
b11 is a bad invasion, for week stones are w6 and w 8. Therefore, attack targets must w6 and w8.]

This cosumi (diagonal move) is a good move.];W[nd];B[ph];W[qi]

I think the result to here is not bad for me, though I'm unsure whether I did not ignore Black too often.
r:w34 is very good move.
many players  would lay at * position.];B[qc];W[re];B[ob];W[oc]
;B[pb];W[nb];B[rb];W[id];B[cj]C[
I felt that this puts White already in a more difficult position, because I have to get something out of an attack on the Black group in the upper right.]

Now Black is alive and the situation is not easy for White.]

Never mind, I thought I can still take away the eye-shape, but no...]
;B[ji];W[cq];B[cp];W[er];B[cr];W[dq]C[
Is there a better move here? Black C2 seems unusual to me.]
;B[dr];W[ep];B[bq];W[fd];B[eb];W[dl]C[
Is this an overplay? I got a satisfying result, but maybe Black can do better.
r:w is strong in central region, therefore ,capture of 82 is difficlult. Hence 82 is not overplay.]

(;W[fm]MA[fb]C[
In the end, due to a Black error, I captured the C2/D2 stones and won. But for now the situation is unclear, where could I improve? Thanks very much!
r:in the endgame, the most important move is sente, 90 is the gote move. Therefore, w 90 must omitted.  * position is vital point w must lay.
Then w will win. I will show  one example in a branch.])
