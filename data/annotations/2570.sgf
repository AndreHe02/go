C[I'm most interested in comments about my opening and early direction of play.  I lost this close game, and I know there's a couple of 1-point mistakes I made in the end, but I really feel that the opening is where I could use the advice.

Thanks, in advance,
John

FOrfun (ff) - This was an interesting game.  Both players seemed to be fighting hard.  Both sides could benefit from trying to grasp the overall position a little more and thinking about where the basic potential is for themselves and their opponent.  There are several times when Black and White seemed to miss the fundamental opportunities that the situation on the board offered.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq]
;B[jq];W[dm]C[ff - More normal would be to play D10.  This leaves too wide a gap on the left side.  White should not be thinking about the lower left corner alone at this early stage.  It is too small compared to Black's position stretching along the lower side to the lower right corner.]
;B[df]C[ff - This is a strange choice.  More normal is approaching from the other side at F17.  In addition, the high approach at D14 is very rare compared to the usual choice at C14.  This move allows White to catch up with Black in terms of who has what areas of influence.]
;W[dh];B[ff];W[fd];B[pj]C[ff - Black needs to continue in the upper left.  Playing away like this is very dangerous.  If Black wanted to play on the right, it should have happened without any play in the upper left.  Black could then choose an appropriate play after seeing White's response to Q10.  This play at Q10 would be better at Q9, setting up the usual Chinese Fuseki relationship with the lower right corner.  The play at Q10 makes it easier for White to play Q5.]

(;W[qf]C[ff - This is definitely the wrong direction.  The only time that White chooses to play around here is when Black already has a stone around K16.  Otherwise White always wants to approach at O17 with the idea to build up the top in conjunction with the upper left corner.

In this case there is also the fact that Black has left the two stones in the upper left stranded.  See the variations.

This move is naturally going to create a weak White group that will offset the weakness of the two Black stones.  Strategically that is not what White wants to do at this point in time.]
;B[jd]C[ff - This is an interesting response.  It makes it heavy fighting inevitable.]
;W[he]C[ff - White does not back down...];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd]
;W[dc];B[bc];W[bb];B[de]C[ff - Black ends in gote in the upper left and still does not have two eyes.  White should keep this in mind in the later fighting.]
;W[nd]C[ff - This might be better at N16.  At the moment, Black has space to jump sideways to M16.  This is a good resource in fighting.  White should want to force the Black stone at K16 to jump out into the center.  If White can chase Black out, playing stones around H13, etc, the upper left Black stones will be threatened.]
;B[pf]
(;W[qc]C[ff - Going for the corner right away seems a little strange in the midst of the fighting here.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[ff - This move creates bad shape for Black and should have been avoided.]
;W[oc]C[ff - White has been able to "hane at the head of three stones".]
;B[lc]C[ff - Not a good choice.  If Black wants to play in this way, N17 is the logical choice.]
;W[rd]C[ff - A sharp move, taking advantage of Black's bad shape.]
;B[re]
(;W[rc];B[qe];W[ne]C[ff - unfortunately this move has no impact on the right side any longer so Black gets to fix things up on the top.  This weakens White's upper left position.  White should play M16 or so instead of this.]
;B[mc];W[nc];B[hc]C[ff - This seriously weakens White.  Black threatens to cut white around G16 and to take away White's eyes by sliding to F18.]
;W[cg]
(;B[bf];W[po];B[nq]C[ff - Should certainly be the high move at O4 since K3 is already low.]

(;W[ql]C[ff - White should attach at R3 in the standard way...]
;B[qk];W[pl];B[qp]C[White's stones have been undercut by this move.  They do not have eyes yet.]
;W[fh];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[gb];B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[eb]C[ff - Just a blunder];W[fb];B[hb];W[ab]C[ff - White has been very lucky here.]
;B[ac];W[cj];B[hf];W[ie];B[gh];W[gi]
(;B[cf];W[fg];B[rn]C[ff - This is not an interesting direction to attack from since Black has already sedured the corner with low plays at O3 and R4.  White should be content to run out and make sure these stones are safe.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[qn];B[qo];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[qh];W[rf];B[se]

(;W[of]C[ff - This direction is not correct.  White does not have to capture these Black stones to win and does not have to connect the two-stone pillar to the corner.  White *does* have to make sure that the lower right stones do not get into trouble.  See the variation.

If we step back and assess the board at this point, White looks very good.  The upper right and left are solid White territory.  The lower left stretching up the left side is also already decided.  Black can still monkey jump down the left side but that is all.  Note that the White left side is quite high - at least 5-line territory, possibly more.  Against this Black has the lower side and lower right corner plus the groups on the right side and upper side.  The key point is that the lower side is quite low.  Black can not turn this into enough territory to catch up - except by attacking the White stones on the right.  These are the only weak White stones on the board.  If White too the opportunity to jump out around O5 or N6 right now the game would be effectively over.  Alternatively White might push at G5, building up the left, pushing down Black, and extending toward the weak stones on the right.]
;B[qg]C[ff - The addition of this stone takes away the aji of a White play at R11.  This may not seem like much at the moment but if the White stones below get into trouble, it could become meaningful.]
;W[og]C[ff- Finally this gives sente to Black in return for almost nothing.]
;B[nj]
(;W[nl]C[ff - One natural play.  At the same time, White should realize that the issue in this game will be how much territory Black will make on the bottom.  In contrast, the center of the board is going to be meaningless for either side so a lower play may be more appropriate.  See the variation.]
;B[nn];W[om]C[ff - This looks awfully tight.  What will White do if Black plays next around M7 for example.]
;B[pn]C[ff - The wrong idea for Black.  This offers White a big opportunity to settle the shape favorably here.  White has at most one eye here so Black should surround White from a distance, building up the bottom territory at the same time.]

(;W[qm]C[ff - White saves the wrong stone. This can not help White make eyes ore escape. Conceptually this may be considered the losing move.  See variation.]
;B[on]C[ff- Black has made a huge gain here.  The bottom is now elevated to a 5-line territory while White does not yet have even one eye.  To be chased out into the center is now very painful for White.]
;W[ll]
(;B[ln]C[ff - This is a little bit slack.  See the variation.]

(;W[lj]C[ff - This leaves behind weaknesses.  White should play as in the variation.  The Black stones that White caps with this play are not threatening to make any territory.  At the same time they are very solid so they are not attacked by this play.]
;B[mk]C[ff - Black immediately demonstrates one of the problems with White's last.]
;W[ml];B[lk]
(;W[jl]C[ff - This move looks dangerous for White.]
(;B[go];W[kk];B[ok]C[ff - Black realizes that there is a problem with the gap at P10 and plays here to fix it up.  When White answers passively with the next move, Black manages to fix the problem in sente.  Black was very lucky here.]

(;W[ol]C[ff - See the variation.];B[gm];W[fn];B[hl];W[in];B[hn]

(;W[jn]C[ff - Just a mistake, see the variation.

The strategic issues have been decided by now.  Both sides still have opportunities to later to pull it out.

Commentary ends here although a few more variations are added to later plays without comments.]
