;B[dd];W[oc];B[dj];W[jp];B[pj]C[playing low is more normal, makes a base.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[ql];B[jd];W[ph]C[hm, seems too close, maybe shimari better?]
;B[pe];W[qd]LB[qc:A]C[This is probably a bad choice; my opponent suggested 'a' instead.

actually same theory: don't get too close of what you want to attack];B
[qe];W[pd]LB[rd:A]C[To play 'a' here didn't feel interesting:
Firstly, Black isn't likely to make territory there so making it open at the edge seems pointless. Secondly, I want my stones to work towards the left, since there's a big moyo there. Thirdly, I'm hoping to make Black heavy so I might get a good attack on him.]
;B[oe];W[md]LB[nd:A][ne:B]C['a' is joseki, but then Black probably just pushes at 'b'. But since this leaves bad aji, probably the whole sequence, starting with R16 is questionable.]
;B[kc]C[feels like not urgent. imho he must go on the right side];W[ld]
LB[mc:A][mb:B][mf:C]C[This doesn't remove the aji, so likely, 'a' or 'b' would be correct
moreover, it looks quite funny isn't it? :)

what about 'c', don't care he can cut. it doesn't help him on eyes..
the move you played doesn't look like anything :)];B[nc]C[Still, this feels early.
i think so too. too early, it's only because the right side  is more important :)]
;W[nd];B[od];W[ob]
(;B[pc];W[qc];B[nb];W[pb];B[lc]C[I'm cut off, but I'm in a position to attack so I think Black was a bit impatient here.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[kg];B[oh];W[pi];B[pl]C[Unexpected move, is Black trying to create confusion?
i don't think this was a good idea from black. he tends to
play strange tenukis, just ignore them :)];W[oi]C[This feels so satisfying to play, it can't be wrong.]
;B[nh]
(;W[nj];B[lh];W[lg];B[ni];W[oj];B[li]LB[ic:A]C[How should White play now? I would like to devise a strategy that takes into account that the five stones at the top have a weak point at 'a', but I can't come up with one.

first you must forget about 'a', it's much too early to think about it! you must solidify your centre group, and attack him simultaniously, later you can see if you will get 'a' or not :)]
;W[jh]LB[ji:A]C[this is the move i thought about. maybe 'a' would be braver,  i'm not sure if it's reasonable.]
;B[qk]C[Really!? :-)];W[lk]LB[kj:A][qm:B]MA[li][pl][jh]C[During the game, this looked natural to me; the five-stone W-shaped white group was behind the sector line of the two marked black stones and the marked white stone seemed to be out in the open, so this move appeard to attack from the weaker side while buildning a moyo below. Now, however, it seems much better to attack from the other side, perhaps around 'a', which looks quite severe. Is #48 the losing move?

i wouldn't say losing move, it's a big word. but 'a' is much better
direction of play, since you induce a fight at your strong side.
certainly you will get the point at 'b', and punish his overplay
of katatsugi.];B[ke];W[le];B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[ih];B[ij]MA[qk]C[Black has gotten away with a tenuki (marked) and still his middle group seems stronger than my upper one. :-(

still is the wrong word. this was your fault: your group
could have been stronger than his, but you jamed it up :)];W[gd]LB[gi:A]
C[I'm hoping for a submissive answer.
difficult to find a good move. maybe at 'a' and prepare a little
more?];B[he]C[Of course! Now G16 really looks like an overplay.];W[gh]LB
[hj:A][ge:B][gi:C]C[Trying to save face by aiming at both 'a' and 'b'.
'a' is not so attractive with this move. 'c' is better locally
i think.];B[gj]LB[fj:A]C[also because now you would have had the point at 'a'.]
;W[gi]LB[ge:A][fj:B]C[Reluctantly, but 'a' doesn't seem to work otherwise.

a typical ajikeshi move. you don't need it now, and you spoil
'b' or the possebility to play ko threats.];B[fj];W[hk]C[same.];B[hj];W

(;W[ib]LB[qm:A]C[This seems to capture the top. Unfortunately, it is quite small, so Black might be happy to sacrifice it to play 'a' instead.]
;B[jb];W[jc]LB[jf:A][qm:B]C[Mistake, loses a liberty, so Black can connect under. 'a' seems to kill. I was however not sure of my own two eyes after 'a', and I didn't like the idea to have to pick Black's stones off the board or giving him forcing moves around F12.

However, globally, since Black insists on living in gote instead of dying in sente :), I'm reasonably ok since I get the good point of 'b'.

yes. this is true... well but you can make eyes later?
first kill at 'a' then later you can live as well?];B[kb];W[kd];B[ia];W
[je];B[ha];W[lj];B[ki];W[qm];B[pm]
(;W[qn];B[pn];W[qo];B[mm]C[I was a bit caught by surprise that my own stones suddenly came under such severe attack.]

(;W[lm]LB[km:A]C[I wanted to get away from Black's strong wall as quickly as possible, even if I had to strengthen my opponent at the same time.  But now I think the kosumi would have been a better choice after all.

i am not very sure... if you play kosumi, he also has more space to run? btw did you think about 'a' too?]
;B[ln];W[km];B[ml];W[ll]LB[kk:A][jk:B][kl:C]C[I looked at 'a' and 'b' during the game, but they seemed useless, so I took a black liberty instead. Afterwards I discovered 'c' which seems to be the best choice.

ohoh. looks like bad luck for white.];B[kn];W[jn];B[jm]C[severe. it's strange, there doesn't seem to exist a counter. :(]
;W[ok]C[Ugly kikashi - I mistakenly thought it would make the following work better.]

tenuki will be included to your territory (because his group
will stay weak)]))

you are that crazy that you eat the 2 stones :)]))
