[oc:B]C[I'd probably play a pincer here, or A.  You seem to be using the 4-4 stone to build territory, which is kind of contrary to its purpose - 4-4's being influence moves.  Also, this move doesn't balance with B - you want to balance your 3rd and 4th line moves

[dfan: In general, there's nothing wrong with a 6-3 point in response to a 3-6 kakari of a 4-4.  It does emphasize territory more than A would, but it means that Black doesn't have to worry about moves like H17.  In this case, though, I think you're right; with all the strength in the upper right, Black is better off pincering or playing high.\]]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[fq];W[dn]C[[dfan: Similarly, this would have been great as a pincer, working both with the lower right and the upper left stones.\]]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[hp]C[[dfan: Too open, I think.\]];W[jq]C[[dfan: And White takes advantage of it.\]]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[mp];W[on]LB[iq:A][jr:B][ir:C][cr:D]TR[dr][fq]
[hp]C[I like A for Black's next move.  If White doesn't respond (with B for example), I believe Black can connect underneath.  Also, A strengthens the triangled stones.

[dfan: Black has been in trouble ever since he played H4.  I agree that he needs a move like A to help make a base (though when White plays a move like B in response, the Black stones on the right will be in big trouble).  Other moves to consider: C helps to prevent White from elbowing in, and D makes some eyespace in sente.\]]
;B[jr]C[I have my doubts about this move

[dfan: It certainly doesn't connect.  Black is essentially sacrificing one of his groups and letting White decide which one.\]]
;W[kr]LB[ir:A][kq:B]C[[dfan: At this point, I wonder about Black playing A, at which point White seems pretty forced to make a horrible shape move at B.\]]
;B[kq];W[ir];B[jp];W[iq];B[ko];W[ip];B[jo]TR[hp][fq][dr]LB[jr:A]
C[The triangled stones have been damaged by this exchange.  I suspect A was the move that lead to the damage.

[dfan: On the other hand, the white stones in the middle aren't totally safe, especially if Black gets M2 in.\]]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[gr];B[gn];W[fr];B[io];W[eq]LB[fp:A]C[[dfan: Why not A?\]]
;B[lr];W[js];B[qm]C[[dfan: I think playing in the upper middle is bigger.\]]
;W[fb]C[[dfan: Weird move.\]];B[gc];W[gb];B[hc];W[ib];B[ic]
;W[jb]LB[kc:A]C[I'm not sure, but I think Black could skip out ahead to A on his next move to keep White very flat.

[dfan: He could indeed.  This whole sequence doesn't make much sense to me.\]]
;B[jc];W[kc]C[Now that White's climbed up onto the third line, it'll be much harder to kill White, and the exchange of small-territory for influence is less painful for White.

[dfan: It's still extremely painful, though.  Very bad exchange for White.\]]
;B[hb];W[ha];B[ga]C[This is reasonable - force White into bad shape]
;W[fa];B[eb];W[mb];B[mc]LB[ea:A][md:B][lc:C]C[[dfan: Note that A is worth around 6 points (not worth taking right away, though).  Don't use contact moves to attack!  B would start making a huge moyo on the right hand side.  The key point for taking away eyespace is C.\]]
;W[nb];B[nc];W[ob]C[Great - White has chosen to stay incredibly low.  This is good for Black, I believe.

[dfan: It's awesome for Black, but by staying in contact so much he's being required to make a lot of moves.\]]
;B[pc]LB[pb:A]C[[dfan: Definitely better at A.\]];W[lb];B[ea]
C[I think this is best left for the endgame.  White isn't going to run to the left.

[dfan: Right.\]];W[pb];B[qb];W[qg]C[[dfan: Black should have been able to finish up in the upper right in sente (by not making contact moves and then play O9 or something, making a great moyo.  Now W has a chance to do something.\]]
;B[ph]LB[og:A]C[[dfan: Don't make contact moves to attack!!  Maybe a cap at A?]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[pf];B[of]LB[qf:A]C[[dfan: The cut at A feels natural here, but I haven't read it out.\]]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[oe];W[qi]LB[pj:A]C[I like A for Black here

[dfan: Yep.\]];B[pi];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[rl];B[kd]LB[ql:A]
[pl:B][pm:C]C[[dfan: Leaving a big A-B-C sequence for White.\]]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[pm]C[[dfan: Hey, and he did it!  I didn't look ahead, I swear!\]]
;B[om];W[pn];B[ol];W[jj]C[[dfan: Good.\]];B[hj]LB[gj:A][jj:B]
C[I like A better.  That way if White attaches to stir up trouble, his stone at B is of less use.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[hi]C[The variation includes a bunch of guesses as to how Black might try to kill.]

(;B[ik]LB[gi:A]C[I prefer A.];W[ij];B[gj];W[jg];B[lg]LB[fh:A]
C[I think it would probably better to try to keep White separated from the left side with A.  If White wants to run toward that powerful wall, great.

[dfan: Agreed.  Black can also build up strength to invade the left.\]]
;W[gi];B[hg]LB[fi:A]C[It's getting harder to keep White separated from the left (and hence struggling for two eyes), but you might still be able to do it with A instead of this move.]
;W[ih];B[hh]C[This is eye-stealing, yes, but White won't need eyes if he can link up with his left side.]
;W[lj];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ig];B[li];W[kg];B[ji]LB[ii:A][ki:B]
C[I don't like this move very much.  Black can't cut at A on the next move, and B is an unimportant stone I think.]
;W[ii]LB[kj:A]C[[dfan: Shouldn't White just play at A?  Black can't push in next move, as it would be self-atari.\]]
;B[kj];W[kk];B[ki]LB[mi:A]C[Not to mention this results.  Now Black has an empty triangle and a shortage of liberties - that is, White has a great forcing move at A.

[dfan: which he should play immediately.\]];W[lf];B[kf]TR[kh]
[jh][ji][ki][li][kj]C[This is of course a mistake.  Black must defend his triangled stones.]
