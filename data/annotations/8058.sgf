RE[W+38.5]
TM[300]

C[md: This was a very exciting game, with lots of fighting, and a huge ko. B lost it in the end because of the top right corner, but he made a few overplays in the middle game which got him in trouble. The ko gave him a life line, but then he lost the top right. I don't see many strategical errors on either side, but many small and greater tactical errors. You both have a talent for fighting though, and I'm sure you'll get stronger if you keep playing tense games like this.]

(;B[hp]C[md: I would think that at this point a move around Q9 would be better for b, because it uses the strength at the right better.]
(;W[gq]C[md: F3 is better. With this move, after b's answer at H3 w's G3 and K4 are both weak.]

;B[jd];W[nc]C[md: B's aim here should be to keep w separated, and O16 seems a better way to do that.]
(;B[of];W[pe];B[oe];W[od];B[qd];W[pg];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[ng]
C[md: that's a very good result for w. B is now more or less confined to the corner, and w has strengthened his centre influence.]
;B[lc]
(;W[le]C[md: this is not efficient, it's too close to w's thickness.]
;B[dg];W[gc]C[md: given the fact that b can always connect underneath at O18, this is not the best point to attack the b area. F17 is probably better.]
(;B[hc]
(;W[hd];B[ic];W[fd]C[md: that's too slow, w needs to play light in b's area. D17 might still be the move here.]
;B[ge];W[gd]
(;B[jf]C[md: wrong side. B can always connect at 018, and w can try to find life now.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb];W[ef];B[df];W[ie];B[je];W[hf]
(;B[qo]C[md: it's difficult to say, but I think I would attack w at the top left a bit more. The aim would be to build up thickness in the centre, where w is a bit stronger than b. It's a matter of timing though. Another issue is whether this is the best way deal with the right side. See variation.]
;W[qn];B[ro]C[md: that's not joseki. When w plays S6, b still has to defend, and w has sealed off the side.]
;W[rn];B[pp];W[oo]C[md: w has a big moyo on the right side now.]
;B[jj]C[md: that's a good move, at exactly the right point.]
;W[lk]
(;B[oh]C[md: I still think attacking the w group top left is the thing to do here, and then turn to the right side.]

;W[lj];B[mm];W[nm];B[nn];W[om];B[mo]C[md: well done by b. He has sacrificed 5 stones, but reduced w's potential area on the left. And now the w group around K4 is starting to look a bit shaky. So that should be the next target.]
;W[pl];B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[rl]C[md: only barely alive!];B[nj]
;W[lh];B[cm]C[md: so I think this is not the right place to attack. Cutting through the w position on the bottom seems more interesting, and then C7 may be the next point.]
;W[cn];B[dm]
(;W[bm]C[md: of course, if w decides to save this stone, the cut is on again. W should have played E5]

(;B[hn]C[md: too hasty, G6 is better.];W[ho]C[md: at this point (preferably earlier, of course), b should recognise that his bottom group has a weakness at H1.]
;B[io];W[gn];B[dl];W[fm];B[jo];W[ip]C[md: it looks like a clever move, but J3 would be a perfectly good answer.]

;W[jh];B[ll];W[jl];B[ki]C[md: I don't understand that move.]
;W[kh];B[hm]C[md: or that one. W can easily connect the K8 group, and b would eventually have to defend at J6. So there is no profit, only risk.]

;B[ll];W[qp]C[md: that's not big enough, since b's whole centre group is on the line.]
