C[*goemu*: hello.
Navigator: hi];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[jp]TR[nc][nd][pf][qf]
[pn][qn][np][nq]C[At this point a direct corner approach is more usual but this move is not bad.]
;W[je]LB[jc:B][jd:A][de:C][fp:D]SQ[dc]C[This is too far from the edge and allows black to slip under. Indeed, with the black stone on D17, "B" might be even better than A for white when it is time to play on the upper side. For now, I would prefer something agressive like C or D]
;B[hc]TR[jc][ld]C[I would go straight for K17 instead. This disputes the top to white and also threatens to play M16 later on and chase the white stone on K15]
;W[hd]TR[jc][pd][je]C[K17 would also be the best spot for white right now. Three white stones on the marked spots would be the start of a very big moyo for white.]
;B[gd];W[he];B[gc];W[ge];B[jc];W[jd]LB[lc:A][de:B][cn:C]C[This is not necessary. There are much bigger points.]
;B[ic]LB[ib:B][ic:A]TR[nc][df][pn][nq]C[This also is unnecessary. If white plays A than black simply answers B with atari. So it is better to take a big point elsewhere.]
;W[kc]C[Good.];B[kb];W[lb];B[ka];W[la];B[jb];W[kd];B[pj];W[nj]
LB[kg:B][ph:A]SQ[la][lb][kc][jd][kd][pd][je]C[Better to secure the top. The squared stones are already a bit overconcentrated. A white stone at "A" would put them to good use.]
;B[ni]LB[qf:B][pg:A][oi:C]SQ[pj]C[A or B would be safer and troublesome enough for white. This is risky. White could cut at C and black will have a hard time rescuing his marked stones. Especially "O11" which will be squeezed on the white wall on top.]
;W[oi]C[Good!];B[oj];W[nh]TR[oh]C[This is too loose. P12 is better.]
;B[mi];W[pi];B[nk]C[Indeed. White is now caught in a ladder.]
;W[on]TR[mh][pl][ql]C[Again. Lets black slip under. Consider the alternatives.]
;B[ol]C[Good];W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[qm];B[pl]
TR[pm]C[Q7 could safely be played instead.];W[qi];B[nm];W[nn]
;B[mm];W[mn]TR[nq]C[One problem with white strategy here is that black is getting center influence while white's gain on the bottom is still very hypothetical (as long as he is open from the left, black can slip through at O3)]
;B[kn]TR[mq][nq]C[N3 or O3 seem more valuable.];W[ko];B[ln]
;W[lo];B[jo];W[om]TR[kq]C[Quick! You should seal the bottom before black steals your profit!]
;B[km];W[kq]C[Excellent.];B[kp];W[lp];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr]TR[dl]
SQ[mi][km][kn][jo][jp][jq]C[It seems that black got a better deal although he should play in the neighbourhood of D8 as fast as possible to profit from his formidable wall.]
;W[js];B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[nq];B[mr];W[ms];B[mp];W[mo];B[is]
;W[np];B[nr];W[or];B[ks];W[ns];B[js]SQ[dl]C[Really unnecessary. D8 much better.]
;W[ls];B[dj]C[Good.];W[ef];B[fe]TR[cf]C[I would prefer C14 myself.]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[de];B[dd];W[ce]C[White has seriously compromised black's potential left territory.]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bf];B[ae];W[af];B[bc];W[ad]TR[gj]C[Little tactical mistake. Now, a play around G10 would seem good for black.]
;B[ac]C[This is too small. It is an endgame move.];W[ei]SQ[ce]
[de][ge][he][je][af][bf][ef][ff]C[White has a tremendous stonewall on top. Always play far away from strength -- either your own or your opponent's.]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[fi];W[gi];B[fk];W[fh];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[fi]

SQ[ce][de][ge][he][je][af][bf][ef][ff][dj][ej][fk][gk][km][kn]
[jo][jp][jq][jr][is][js]C[Now white is overconcentrated on top and black has made very big profit. His two walls work together optimally. That's about 14 points secure territory for white and 44 for black. (the bottom left can still be invaded, that's why I don't count it in the total yet.

This is one reason for the earlier advice : play away from your own strength. White did not make good use of his wall.]

;W[bh];B[aj];W[ch];B[ai];W[ag];B[bk]LB[qc:B][cq:A]C[A and B are the urgent points now.]
;W[id]LB[id:A][ie:B]SQ[qc][hd][jd][he][je][cq]C[This is a bamboo wall connection. Black plays A white answers B or vice versa. So there is no need to connect now. Better invade C3 or secure R17.]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[rm];W[rn];B[qn];W[qo];B[qm];W[sn];B[sk]SQ[qc]
[cq]C[Same comment.];W[ro];B[sj];W[si];B[sl];W[sm]C[Navigator: i guess this is it...]
;B[tt]C[Navigator: do you see anything else?
*goemu*: not really im just checkin stuff out
Navigator: ok :p, i'm sure there must be a crack somewhere in my walls, good luck in finding it]
;W[ml]C[*goemu*: let's try
Navigator: :p good one, hadnt see that one
*goemu*: i might die >.<
*goemu*: that rhymed
Navigator: we both might :p
*goemu*: it's a close game either way];B[lm];W[nl]C[Navigator: a very nice one too, i believe it's the cooles game i've played up to now
*goemu*: yeah];B[mj]C[Navigator: mmhz, i wonder who's gonna win, with komi it's gonna be damn close
*goemu*: i don't think i can do much more with those two
Navigator: probably not, it was a nice try though, if i hadnt responded the right way you could have killed my group on the right
*goemu*: there were a bunch of ways it could go wrong though
*goemu*: and it did arrgh
Navigator: definately
Navigator: :) sorry bout that
*goemu*: no problem]

;B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[qc]C[This is something that either player should have done.

This was indeed a nice game. Both players are definitely stronger than 28k in my opinion. Both would benefit from playing the big points before the small ones and trying to play far away from their walls. The purpose of a wall is to threaten to make *BIG* territory or crush your opponent against it if he dares to play close. Even if he manages to live with two eyes that makes 2 points for him and another big wall (the new one you made while crushing him) with which to make sure profit.
