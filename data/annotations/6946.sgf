Hi

I am Peter from germany too. So your english is not worth than mine.
I am a local 1k. So don't take my advice as the truth. I can give you only some hints.
I will prefix my comments with g4 - go4fun is my nick on kgs.

Thanks for the opportunity
Peter

C[g4: As you lead, I would prefer the contact play at R9. Your group is alive then and you can attack without caring for the live of your group.]
;W[qh]
(;B[fb]C[g4: Big, but...
It is nearly endgame now. All groups seem secure. When you count, you realize that black is 50 points ahead.
So it may be most easy to secure your groups and end the game.
Both groups above and left of the lower left corner are not completely alive. You should play moves there to secure the lifes of the groups while gaining some territory.
See some vars];W[eb];B[fc];W[he];B[ff];W[fo];B[fr]C[g4: This has the same territorial value as a move at L2. Your left side group is completely alive and strong. Your P2 group may come under attack. So always strengthen your weak group.]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[do];B[co];W[hr]C[g4: Better at G2. This leaves a gap at F4, G4.]

(;B[dm]C[g4: This is a strong and good move securing a lot of territory. Maybe E8 or even F8 secure more, but also not so tight.
An alternative is the strong cut thru F4! See var];W[fm];B[fk]

(;B[pk]C[g4: Far too small. You made an error but don't stop thinking! Perhaps you can rescue the group. The 10 stones in the center are unimportant. If you could save the corner you will still win the game. See vars
But if you lose the corner you still have a chance. The only weak white group is at the top. Perhaps you can attack it and gain territory.
If you count you will notice that the game is close still];W[sn]
;B[sp]C[I can not save the corner. Therefore T4 was a waisted move.]
;W[rm];B[kq];W[kr];B[os]C[g4: This was sente already. So this group is completely alive. Not necessary to play here now.]

Now I resigned.

I would be very hapy for any idea.

Thanks for the review
Deterius



This was an interesting game.
I think you play very good in the opening. Try to evaluate the relative strngth of the groups. Be careful when your opponent tries to cut. Try to count liberties. If you would have played very conservatively, you should have won the game easily.
I think you are on the right way.

Have fun
