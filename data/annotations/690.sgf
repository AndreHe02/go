C[    Nice opening moves through white 10.
     Black 11 at "b" seems better to me. "a" and the marked stone are both 3rd line, so the play as in the game makes a flat structure.]
WL[22]
(;B[cj]BL[20];W[ec]MA[ej][di]C[     Black 13 is a very odd move.  It is not in the joseki books. It does not serve to build up a moyo very well, as the resulting "moyo" can easily be reduced, at points such as X. Nor does black 13 protect the co
rner. Nor does it attack white 12, as white can easily go into the corner.       I would be tempted to try a pincer here, at "b", "c," or "d."
     Black "e" seems better than black "a," from the point of view of territory building, but puts no pressure on white. Black is falling behind subtly.]
WL[20]
(;B[ee]BL[15];W[cc]WL[15];B[bc]C[     White 16 is an overplay, as seen in the comment for black 17.
     White 16 should be at "b." A study of the variations show that white gets a better result no matter what black does. This also illustrates why black 13 was poorly positioned.]
BL[14]

(;B[bd]MA[ab]C[White 18 at "b" makes better shape, both for eyes, and eliminate the yose sente of "X."]
BL[714]
(;W[dc]C[Black 19 has almost no value. It should be at a big point, such as one of the marked points.]
WL[644]
(;B[de]TR[ec][dc][cc][bb]C[White 20 seems to be in the wrong direction. The marked white stones are alive and have no moyo potential, so the top is played out. White 20 would be better at "b."]
BL[675]
(;W[nc]C[     I seem to be commenting on very many moves, and I apologize for this. In actuality, all the moves to this point seem spirited, which counts for a lot in Go. I particularly commend the spirit of black 13 and white 16, even though bot
h of these moves would have benefited from a little reading of possible opponent's responses.
     Now, to continue with the commentary. Since the top is played out, black should not pincer. Black must play at "b" or "c."]
WL[631]
(;B[lc]BL[672];W[qc]WL[629];B[pc]BL[666];W[qd]C[Black 25 is a mistake. See "Get Strong at Joseki 3," problems 47-57.]
WL[627]

(;W[pe]C[Black 27 should probably be at  "b." Neither player seems to be doing any reading here. At each move, each player is giving the other an opportunity for reversal of furtunes. I find myself on the edge of my chair, wondering how the game  will turn out.]

WL[568]
(;B[of]BL[611];W[pg]WL[547];B[ic]C[It is hard to say exactly who benefited more (or suffered the least) in the upper right. However, black seems over-concentrated. Black's position on the upper right is limited by the solid white stones on  the upper left. This is fundamentally because of black's pincer at 21. Strangely, the result here is not too far off of the joseki sequence that I displayed starting with the alternate move for black 25.]
BL[604]
(;W[gc]C[Maybe black 39 is better at "b," to give chase to the white group. Black has a good idea of sealing white in to build a center moyo, but the moyo will be too flat. Black needs a strategy that has a chance of winning, and right now the be
st bet seems to be to fight. White is currently ahead on territory.]
WL[543]
(;B[hd]TR[bb][cc][dc][ec][gc]C[White 40 at "b" seems the safest move. Otherwise, the marked white group will be a liability. White will have all four corners, and black's center moyo is pretty flat. White should have no problem reducing it and winning easily.]

ey point. Even so, black's agressive aims are going to be limited, because black will damage the black stones on the right side. But this may be unavoidable.]
WL[716]

     But as one sees in the moves to follow, that is unfortunately what happens. In the moves that follows white suddenly seems to be unwilling to give up even a few stones, and thus ends up losing a lot of stones.]

 group in the center and then having it captured. Thus a move like "b" seems attractive, as it lightly reduces the center,  and is a severe attack on the marked black stones. With this attack, the marked white stones will be able to link up to the upper r
