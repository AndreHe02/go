C[Please point out any moves that are obviously wrong. Then explain why it was so obvious to you (since it wasn't obvious to me). For explanations you might mention proverbs, the fact that you saw the shape before, etc. The idea is that if I can understand how you came to the conclusion then maybe these things will start being obvious to me also.

Also, whether it was obvious or not, I am always interested in alternative possibilities for my moves. Maybe teach me a new trick :)

In summary, I want to understand a bit of how you think about go, so I can start playing that well too.

Please don't hold back on number of moves that you criticize. I prefer brief criticism of many moves rather than long explanation of why a certain move lost the game. I will read the review over and over (by putting it on my screensaver) until I understand all my mistakes.]
;B[pp]C[I'm not sure how insightful you will find my comments; I am between you and your opponent in rank. I'll do my best!

Overall I thought you had a pretty good position early on, and you outplayed white. I think the big problem was letting W consolidate his moyo - you needed to invade much earlier than you did in the game.]

;W[kp];B[in]C[Doesn't really attack the W stones very strongly, perhaps B should play K3 first. Alternatively, B could play D6, and if W pincers J4 then B runs at J6, keeping W split into two weak groups.]
;W[ep];B[dn];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[br];W[gq];B[ir];W[jq];B[iq]
;W[ho];B[io];W[gm]C[OK so far. Important to make sure the line of black stones has access to the centre, so J8 next feels natural.]
;B[lr]C[Too soon to attack, and may not be the correct point: one line higher at M3 is worth exploring. Neither W group is entirely secure as yet, but can you kill either of them? If you don't kill this group, what do you gain? For example, if you were going to make some terrritory in the centre, then attacking from aboce would be better (e.g. L5). 

J8 prepares to attack either side, and strengthens the B stones.]
;W[pq];B[or];W[nr];B[op];W[jr]C[W has helped you secure the corner, so M2 has been effective. You could choose to sacrifice M2 by playing from above, (L6 or O6 for example) continue with J8 or even tenuki with say R14, or K17.

I prefer J8.];B[lp]C[I feel nervous about playing this now. You have to be very sure it works, and you can assume you will end in gote. Given that you have two groups that require attention (the J and M strings of stones) even if you capture the 3 W stones (O2) you may still end up behind if W gets a nice attack.]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[ko];B[no];W[mo];B[mp];W[nn];B[oo];W[il]C[This feels hard for B now.]
;B[jl]
(;W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[ll]C[This is a desparate fight for B to get into ... I hate having to play like this :-) I'm looking possible moves for B like the clamp at G5 and the attachment at G2 and G4. Perhaps B can get an eye and avoid the seki?]

;B[om];W[nj];B[nk];W[mi];B[ok];W[hr];B[is]C[I think B has done very well to get to this position, there doesn't seem to be any way out for W. But white now has a great position at the top. Assuming W now captures M12 for the thickness, where does B play?]
;W[js];B[ks];W[ms];B[os];W[kq]
(;B[ns];W[hn];B[nm];W[hq];B[on];W[hp];B[mr]C[This is an awful result for B, and N2 is endgame. M12 is big, letting W capture here gives wonderful thickness. B also needs to consider playing at the top, possibly K17? A w move at K16 is very big.]
;W[cl];B[bm]C[Too slow. W is building a huge moyo and you need to do something about it NOW. As W, I would next play K16, and feel satisfied :-)]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[dm];B[dl];W[em]
(;B[bn];W[ck];B[jd]C[Probably should be one line closer to the edge. With all that thickness W has in the middle, B has nowhere to run, so need to find eyes at the top.]
