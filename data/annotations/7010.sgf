AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[qf];B[pj];W[rd];B[of];W[pc]C[how do you feel about this?

Good move for white.  There is a chance black can become very strong outside though, but black's response was weak, so white gained a lot here.  In either case, white gets sentei.]

(;B[oc];W[qc];B[mc]C[Very nice result for white.  Now play somewhere else.  White is alive here and there are bigger moves all over the board.]
;W[qi]C[was this too small? perhaps white should have played elsewhere.

White is already alive at the upper corner.  Stay away from your own strong group.  It's a preverb.

Also R11 is a bad move for white.  It gains almost nothing and give black a chance to build a strong wall.  If you really need to solidify in other situations, R12 is a much better move, because S11 by the opponent won't be as painful.]
;B[qj];W[cf]C[since the lower right side has become stronger, my goal was to reduce the bottom. is this the correct way?

Looks okay.];B[df];W[dg]C[how do you feel about the result on the upper left?

Too early to say.  It's still a long way to go.  Looks fine to me.]
;B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[cj];B[fd];W[fq]C[my goal now shifted to reducing the top. i was thinking about O3 as well.

Both are fine.  It really depends on black's response.  You can play F3 then O3 right away.  Pro's do that all the time.  It's a matter of taste.  Be patient and make steady moves to catch up.  So far white's R11 was a mistake, otherwise all is good. Black lost points on the upper right, but played solid afterwards.  So still early in the game.]
;B[hq];W[cn]C[would something like D2 or F5 have been better?

This is joseki.  It's a good move because its potential to build big influence with C10 group.

D2 and F5 are both okay moves and can be played, not better or worse.  It depends on your strategy and your style.]
;B[dn];W[cq]C[how do you feel about this?

Okay move.];B[kq]C[black making mistake here.  urgent moves before big moves.  D3 is urgent.]
;W[dq]C[is this the right direction?

white happy.];B[dm];W[cm];B[pi]C[horrible move for b.  almost the same as empty triangle because R11 is such weak stone.]
;W[qh]C[white happy];B[nq];W[jf]C[how do you feel about this move?

A bit of pro flavor in this move.  Yes, it's urgent around here now.  You can also try h17 and keep it light because it's still open at the top.  Depending on your strategy.  I don't think black would get all the center yet.]
;B[jd];W[id]C[my aim was to maintain sente to eventually reduce the lower side.

You want to keep yourself light here though.  So make sure you don't finalize this area too soon.  H17 is still playable.  Remember 4th line is the line of victory.  You are giving away a lot of territory here.]
;B[ie]C[Good move by black.]
(;W[je]C[was this the right way?];B[hd]C[i was thinking about J14 and L16 too.]
;W[ic]C[i would have played L16 if black played J14];B[kd]
(;W[if];B[he]C[Bad result for white.  Giving away too much for little in return.]
;W[qp]C[how do you feel about this?

Okay move.];B[qq];W[qo]C[i was also thinking about Q3.];B[rq]
;W[ql];B[hf];W[ol];B[rj];W[dl]C[my aim was to capture the black stones on the lower left. how do you feel about my objective?

Yup.  Pretty good.  Attack the only weak black group and you can gain a lot.]

;B[gq];W[fr];B[ep]
(;W[nd]C[what should white have played?

Definitely not N16.  You can attack black's weak group. P13 and focus on chasing Q10 black group a while.]
;B[od];W[me];B[lf]C[you are playing against black's strong group, it's very hard to fight and win here.  I couldn't find better moves so white must've made a mistake earlier:-).]

(;W[le];B[ke];W[kf]C[how do you feel about the following ten moves?

white gave away too much. have to.  because this is not an area white can win fights.]

;B[oh];W[fk]C[my objective was to capture black's two middle left stones since i was not able to capture black's lower left stones. how do you feel about the following ten moves?

it would be good result for white because you will have a lot of influence on the center.  it's hard to get much territory in the center though.]

;B[po];W[on];B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[no]C[it's a trade.  not much advantage for white.  in fact you now have a weak group.  but since you are still behind, you have to create confusion in order to make black make mistakes.]

;W[gg]C[my objective was connect the upper middle group with either the left or the lower right.

O10 connects.  Remember when you play a strong player, you don't want to have too many weak group.  Black can play O9 and your lower right group would be under severe attack.]

But the endgame was the obvious weakness.  If you can focus a bit on your endgame, you could go up a few level easy.  Also make sure you don't play too close to the strong area, both your opponent's and yourselves'. Above all have fun playing go!]
