C[krv: I'm playing  white here.

I think errors in this game are typical to me and thus ask you for help to improve my play.

Thank you for your time and attention.

I hope my comments can help you
e-mail me if you have anymore question

;B[cj];W[jd]C[White's opening is kind of wierd
I would rather play C15 instead of D17
because K16 seems awkward in this situation];B[qj];W[jj]C[I like to play tengen early

well,tengen in not an important move right now,because K3 is huge]
;B[jp];W[dg]C[D13 is lacking of a clear purpose
If white wants to take the corner,C14 would be a better choice,if white wants to build up a moyo,D12 would be more intense]
;B[bg];W[cf]C[If we change the sequence,it would be the same as white plays C14 first,and black plays B13,the move of D13 would be too slow]
;B[ch];W[di];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[fi];B[ej];W[fj]C[This is an overplay,white has no choice but to play F12]
;B[eg]C[It is hard for white to decide how to play now]
(;W[fh]C[krv: Is F13 better now?

If white plays at F13,black will actually capture the stone first and then play at E14 for a ko fight,however,white has no big ko threat in such early stage]

C[krv: Which points are big now?
I consider a-f (played stone is only fourth in my eyes, but I'm unsure about it)

e is not a good choice,black will play at P3,and then O4,Q6
black is gaining territory while attacking white

white may consider to play at b first,after the joseki,white will have the sente to play at f ,if black plays the sequence of R5,Q6,O4,white can invade the R10 stone from R12,d the game will be determined by the fight]
;B[hq];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[fp]C[This variation of joseki is not good in this situation
first, white cannot afford to lose more territory now
seconf, white must have the sente to play at bottom right

white can simply follow the original joseki at F2];B[eq];W[er]

C[This peep is not necessary,white can simply atari at E9 then connect at F7]
;B[dj];W[ek];B[fo];W[go];B[fn];W[hp];B[iq];W[gn];B[fm]
(;W[gm]C[krv: G8 is better?

G8 is definitely better,white's main goal now is to connect and to seal black,G8 serves for both purposes]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gl];W[im]C[White has to play at H8,if black plays H9,white can cut at G9 and black has to defend at D6]

;B[eb];W[fb];B[gq];W[gp];B[hm];W[hn];B[nc];W[ne]C[krv: Which moves are good with O17 invasion?

white has to guard the corner first,O15 is ineffective because of R10]
;B[qb];W[qh]C[krv: Are there any good moves near O17 and R18?

not at this point];B[oj];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[lo];B[mp]
;W[np];B[mo];W[mn];B[nn];W[lp]C[krv: I thought that I can take N5.

the reason that N5 does not work is because M3 is too close to K4,therefore,I would play M6 instead of M5]
;B[mq];W[on];B[nm]
(;W[oo]C[krv: Q5 is better?

yeah,if black plays at Q5,the corner will be safe];B[po];W[om]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[nl];W[pm];B[kn];W[qm];B[or];W[nr];B[qr];W[rp]
C[krv: S5? or leave for later?

in fact,white has no way to threat the corner now
it's probably a good time to resign now,because white is way behind in territory]
