C[Mark: This game I did win, but only by time (my opponent did not make moves in time on DragonGoServer).  In the end position, I am definitely behind.  I think that's due to opening moves, but am not sure.

Claude: we'll see that.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce]C[Mark: I decided to attack the unfinished corner.

Claude: no problem so far...];W[ed];B[dg];W[cj]LB[ch:A]C[Claude: It's the consequence of playing high, black can choose to attack like this. This is not necessarily a problem but if you want to avoid fight, you can play low in A.]
;B[bc]LB[fg:B][dm:A]C[Mark: I felt concerned that these stones needed some eye space, so I moved to the corner.  Looking back, I could have placed a pincer at A for a more agressive approach.

Claude:A is the move recomended in Kogo's Joseki Dictionnary - since playing high in D13 means that you are ready to fight, it's coherent to do so. Now, personnally, I would also be tempted to play a move like B before playing on the second line so soon in the game...]
;W[hd];B[md]LB[pj:B][dm:C][fq:A]C[Claude: At this stage of the game, if there are no urgent attacking or defensing move, you should consider playing on the biggest inoccupied part of the go-ban, that is on the biggest free edge. If you really want to attack, then play the high pincer on the C10 stone that you wanted to play earlier.The white upper left group is not yet really stabalized but neither really weak, plus you've got a not so strong group next to it so it could be disastrous to attack it right now.

Claude:I would then play on one of the lettered moves.];W[kc]
C[Claude:White is happy to plya this move, now his group is solid and you have to defend.]
;B[mc];W[qj]C[Claude:and your N16 moves made you loose sente... even if you made some territory in the upper left corner.]

(;B[qg]C[Claude:I would attack from the other side. One principle says "push the opponent towards your strong stones".]
;W[qm];B[nq]C[Claude:Now white will have a big portion of this edge...]
;W[rp]
(;B[qr];W[jq]C[Claude:Looking at the whole board, white stones seem already more efficiently spread among the board.]
;B[gp];W[eq];B[gq]C[Mark: I often make this move in these situations, trying to start seperating the two groups.

Claude:Not that bad for now, you are clearly attacking the K3 stone]
;W[jo];B[gn];W[dn]
(;B[im]C[Mark: Now I feel trapped, so I start moving out to connect or make eyespace.

Claude:Don't feel trapped! The longer your group the stronger it will also be. I think continuing with a tobi is more efficient. Plus, you are pushing white towards his own stones.]

(;B[oe]TR[kc][hd][qj][qm]C[Mark: Okay, I feel somewhat good about this group.  I think it's safe and it has some influence to the center.  But I do think it's cramped, given the marked white stones.

Claude:Your move is too slow. The white stone might have very very little aji left, but you have more urgent concerns. One principle of Go is "Play far from force" (your's or opponent's: playing too near to your opponent force is dangerous, while playing too near to your own force is slow).]
;W[oo];B[oj]TR[nm]C[Mark: Trying to add support to the marked stone while possibly extending from the upper right.

Claude:Why not. Good move.];W[mj]
(;B[pi];W[ok];B[nk]LB[pn:A]TR[qm][oo]C[Mark: I think this just invites the cut.

Claude:...];W[be]
(;B[cd]C[Claude:Forget the two stones! Try to make life! But in fact I think it is already too late. I dunno how to make a living group...]
;W[db];B[ba];W[ab]C[Mark: And this looks to kill the group.  I assume it's dead at this point.  I really need some guidance on how to play differently up here.  I used several moves to no effect.]
;B[jp]C[Mark: But I like this move --- it connects up and gives me more bottom territory.

Claude:Yes.];W[gj];B[hg]C[Mark: My opponent at this point lost due to lack of time (he wasn't making moves promptly on DGS).  But, this board looks like a loss for black.

Claude:I hope to have given you some directions to understand why you fell behind in territorry like this.]
