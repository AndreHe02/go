C[Mech91 [2k\]: hi
bun3 [2k\]: hi

dv: Hi, I am Dieter Verhofstadt, 2 dan.

I think our level is not too different and we make the same kind of mistakes. Typically, an amateur 2d/2k tends to neglect his weak groups and pay too much attention to points. I believe this was also the case in this game, where White could have lost 

1. The invasion group at the right side, at 101
2. The top right corner, at 107
3. The left side, at 203

I think we could dramatically increase our winning percentage by making sure we do not lose important groups in the late middle game, and look for opportunities to cut off and kill opponent groups in the late middle game. This involves playing a little more conservatively and reinforce groups instead of taking/reducing territory, but playing more aggressively when it comes to weak groups.

Besides this main theme, I have a few more remarks, where you've asked questions or elsewhere.]
;B[qe];W[dc];B[co]LB[ep:B][cq:C][dq:A]C[in this opening i have always a problem of approach,is hard to me know how is the best move to approach the black corner

dv: For the 3-5 point, basically you have three options, A, B, C. See variations.

You can also look at the extensive coverage at http://senseis.xmp.net/?35PointJosekis.]
(;W[pp];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[cq]LB[ce:A][nq:B]C[this is a  mistake? d3 i think better

dv: I think in this opening it is best to play a shimari at A, because after B the lower side is not so interesting anymore as the left side. But I'm not an expert in fuseki.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[eq]
(;W[er]C[dv: I would play as in the variation];B[cp];W[fq]LB[nq:A]
C[dv: I don't like this, because it stresses the lower side, which has become less interesting after A.]
;B[cr];W[fp];B[bq]C[dv: This is a slow move];W[jp]C[lightly overconcentrated?but is not really bad result i guess

dv: All your money is on the lower side, but Black is overconcentrated in the corner, so I feel the game is balanced.]
;B[ce]
(;W[hc]LB[ed:A][de:B]C[too far?

dv: This is an unusual response. I would have played A or B, stressing the upper side. See variation for B.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[dj]C[dv: Now the upper side is low and the left side is big]
;W[cd];B[de];W[pc]
(;B[nc]C[even in this case the choice of the move si hard but maybe is only a style choice

dv: This is a bad choice: White is already very strong at the top left.]
;W[od];B[md];W[pf];B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[qd];B[rd];W[pe];B[re]
;W[rc]C[dv: This looks good. The corner is strong and Black has weak stones at the top]
;B[pg]
(;W[em]LB[kd:B][dg:A]C[i was must attack

dv: But this is not attack. This is reduction. Attack would be A or B. Your move is not bad, though, as it is on the border of two moyos.]
;B[eo];W[dk];B[fo];W[cj]C[dv: 2 very good tenukis. Black should have answered here.]
;B[ci]
(;W[ej]TR[ed][fd][ce][de]SQ[dk][em]C[dv: Here I would atari on the other side. We should not worry here about the stones close to Black's strong group, if we can attack the triangled stones. See variation.]
;B[di];W[ck]C[dv: This is heavy];B[cm]C[even now i cant undestand if this exchange was good for me

dv: You have entered Black's moyo successfully but his groups have become stronger. Now you should care about your group.]
;W[ei]C[dv: good move!];B[dg];W[go]LB[fk:A]C[dv: Here, you push Black over your weak group. I think you should protect at A instead.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[fm]C[dv: Black is too timid];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk]

;B[mq]
(;W[np]C[dv: Here I would play a leaning attack; See variation]
;B[mo];W[qo];B[pn];W[ro];B[no]C[dv: This is a great success for Black. He is connected, has influence to the center and endgame at the bottom. There is bad aji in the corner too.]
;W[hm]LB[hj:A]C[maybe i was must go to hepl the f9 group cause is not very strong

dv: Yes. Playing A for example would have helped that group]
;B[gm];W[en];B[fn];W[dn]C[really bad moove,completely gote

dv: Yes, this is a lost move];B[jc];W[ql]LB[hj:A]C[dv: I think White is not strong enough to invade and does not need the invasion either. Reinforcing at A is better.]

dv: I think it is a very good exchange. You sacrifice those three stones, to save your left side.]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[ii];B[fg];W[hd]C[dv: Black can now still cut off the left side but White can live. See variation.

It's impressive that you let this group be. I only found a mistake at 203, where Black finally gets a chance to kill.]
