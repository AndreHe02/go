C[Mike: Hi reviewer!

Mike: I was white in this game. Hope you can point out my mistakes in strategy and help me to improve. There isn't very much I can tell about this game. I think my opening was bad and black was getting away, but in the end I won with many points.
Most of my games I try to get good influence towards center & sides and usually find myself losing all corners to my opponent and getting no points. In this game I tried to get as much as I could from corners and and see what would happen.]
;B[pd]C[Evgeny: Hello, Mike. My name is Evgeny. Nice to meet you. 

In my point of view roots of your problems are not from the bad opening but for misunderstanding some types of basic shapes. A good example is the opportunity to attack black wall in move 91 you have missed. It's good practice when you learn joseki always asking yourself questions like "what if W plays that way?". Usually those variations has a lot of interesting things you probably don't know yet. It helps you to improve a lot. And of course, keep practicing, play more games.

If you have any questions, mail me at: eshavlyugin@gmail.com]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[ql];B[on];W[nq];B[pk]C[Mike: Sometimes my oppenent plays R10. What is the right way to deal with it?
Evgeny: you almost handle it right. Main idea is to cut black in 2 parts. I had explained few ideas behind this few moves later. See joseki dictionary for more variations.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[qh];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp]C[Evgeny: This is bad for black, because connection between his stones is not strong. It's better start with 'b'.]
(;W[pm]LB[rq:A]C[Eveny: I don't like this move. It's better to block black at A and keep cut opportunity for later. See variations.]

Evgeny: I'm not sure too. Black could have built a strong wall after it. Simple jump at A is better]

;B[ne];W[ng]C[Mike: there must be better sequences for b...
Evgeny: yes, it is. Now black has lost his wall and stones in the corner. You have gained a lot of territory. The opening is good for White.]

;W[dm];B[ci];W[cc]C[Mike: Only move that I could figure out. My plan was to get sente and play M13 after corner is safe.

;B[cg];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[lg]LB[fc:B][fb:A]C[Mike: N13 better for b perhaps?
Evgeny: Black has to finish his wall at B first. A is standard attack for this kind of shapes. Even it's not possible to break through black wall, white can establish a strong group playing with A. See variations for details]
(;W[ig]C[Mike: B's moyos was getting huge so I had no choice than trying reduction. This move seems very risky and I think outcome far was more than I deserved.
Evgeny: This is a good move. One line higher would be too submissive.]
;B[ii];W[fc]LB[fb:A]C[Mike: just to create some aji
Evgeny: This is a 'thank you move'. A is correct way to exploit weakness of black wall.]
;B[fb];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[if]C[Mike: B's last two moves weren't quite good.]
;W[kf]C[Mike: I played this because b was only thinking big moyo and didn't attack my stones from outside.
Evgeny: I don't think black can kill white. Black isn't strong enough from outside to do it.]
