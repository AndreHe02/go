C[humbleCow [5k\]: enjoy
newsman [6k?\]: gg];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[qo];B[np];W[qq]C[I wanted to settle quickly so I could try to move on to big points, so I chose R3

Yes its a  good move to settle];B[qr]
(;W[rq]C[this is a bit passive i think since it is still the beggining and you  have no reason to avoid the second variation of the normal  joseki   shown before]
;B[pp];W[rr];B[dd]
(;W[gc]C[This was a misclick actually, I meant to play F17.

I considered making shimari with C4, but I didn't want to allow black to get a start on solidifying a framework on the top side

F17 is good  , shimari also good , cant say what is better.]
;B[dg];W[db];B[cc]
(;W[nc]C[I felt I had to do something to forestall the damage from a black J17 and subsequent development from Q16

Maybe an extension to K17 would be a better way to protect?

Yes K17  is  a  lot  better than this one  since the  D18  and G17 stone can come  under attack now]

(;B[oc];W[nd];B[ob]C[
I was taken aback by this move.  O18 seems overconcentrated and slow, and Q15 might end up giving me outside influence which I'm not sure now to use.

 this move and the mve black  played before this   looks  kind of bad actually since they both give you th  chance to  defend the weakness of  D18 and G17 stones]

(;W[qg]TR[db][gc][nc][nd]C[I have a feeling this is a bad move, but I wasn't sure what else to do.

I felt that I could rescue the O17 group without much trouble if they were under attack.  Maybe I'm fooling myself about this

This is a bad move since it creates   alot of weak groups for white,  all the marked stones luck  space for eyes still]
;B[of]C[Of course balck did well to not let you connect];W[re]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[pe];W[kc]C[I seemed to stop him from getting the right side.  he did enter the center though.

Yes , if black played somewhere there first  it would be disastrous for white]

(;B[eq];W[iq]C[A move like D6 or D5 seemed slow and just giving up the lower side

Yes this looks interesting , it will provoke a fight];B[cq]
;W[lq]C[I hoped to slide to O2 later and steal the black group's base

Although  the  corner stone at c4 will suffer if black plays there first this is an interesting choise here since it attacks  blacks group.]
;B[mr]TR[np][pp][pq]C[Now you need either  continiu attacking  blacks  marked  group or defend c4]

(;W[ci]C[N2 didn't seem severe enough to make me respond when so much is about to be solidified on the right side.  By now I feel that I have too many precarious unconnected groups on the board, but how else to break up black's advantageous starting position?  I hate moyo games, so...]
;B[cl];W[bg]C[I liked the idea of scooping out black's base for my own safety.

yes this is a good move as  far as it conserns the  top leftt part of the table]
;B[bf];W[cg];B[cf]
(;W[ei]C[I think you'll hit me with the bamboo stick for not making correct shape at D12.

It seemed to give better access to the center, but maybe I'm fooling myself.]
;B[el]
(;W[dq]C[this is what I love about the 3-4 point.. it's so hard to complete neutralize it

Still this isnt a  good move, i see you later  made life in the corner  but still the proper would be  b3 instead of this]

;W[kq];B[mq];W[jr];B[hp];W[lr]C[felt the need to make a sure eye right away
 yes    since black left you the chace  it was right to take it right away]
;B[qk]C[this is the price of having too many groups to take care of....

Yes in this possition black is way better
he has both more thickness and safe territory];W[qd];B[qc];W[rc]

I let him become strong.];B[ef]
(;W[gk]C[foolish. this is not a tenable connect and I know it.]
;B[fj];W[fi];B[gj]
(;W[go]C[in retrospect this is not a very good safety move for whilte.  I needed to move toward connection with K2 group.

This move isnt  good since it  adds another stone with no base   for white
 and  black can  launch an attack at the   c13  group .

 and also can just conect at g4 and  threat to kill  2 groups 
(g4  looks the safest and better for black)]
(;B[gq];W[im]C[c13 group still needs attention];B[hj];W[gg]
;B[ho]

;B[rg]
(;W[rf];B[pb]C[now I realize that R18 was a big sente move.  Should have played it as it would have forced black to connect and make safe, while I took his corner in return. 

R18 isnt sente];W[sf];B[ph];W[cb]C[ignored my danger too long....]
