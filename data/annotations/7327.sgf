C[oslito: Hi, my name is Marcin, I'm around 10kyu (DGS - "oslito"), I'll try to give you some comments, please contact me if something will be not clear or just in case of any question ;)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[co];W[pd]
(;B[qe]TR[oc][pc][qc][od][qd][oe][pe]C[oslito: This is too close, marked places are in contact with white stone. Contact play increas strength of opponent stone/group, because induces opponent move.]
;W[qd]SQ[pa][qa][ra][sa][pb][qb][rb][sb][pc][qc][rc]C[oslito: And white single stone becomes strong corner group with lot of potential territory.]
;B[qf]LB[jd:B][nd:C][dj:A][dq:D]C[oslito: as white I would prefer one of marked points.]

(;W[qm]C[Duncan (W): Looks to me like I should be able to do catch those two stones but that this move wasn't the best way to do it. I've given Sarah the option to play R10 here with no great response. My thinking was that  Sarah would defend at R5 and then I'd retreat to R10. Would I have been better off leaving an attack until after I'd played in the lower left?

oslito: white approach at r7 doesn't put a lot of pressure at q4. In addition ot gives chance to black to play pincer at r10, what is good for black, because it's two purpose move - attack and development.]
;B[ed]C[oslito: Not necessary contact play - gives much more to the opponent than to player]
;W[ee]C[Duncan (W): Clearly a crazy response - I should have played under.

oslito: yes :)];B[fd]
(;W[fe];B[gd]
(;W[kd]LB[dc:B][kc:A]C[Duncan (W): I'm in two minds over whether this was a sensible move after I'd made the initial error.

oslito: I would prefere third line to attack... but still d17 is more important]
;B[di]
(;W[qh]C[Duncan (W): I've recognised I'm in trouble here but should I have played at the bottom instead?]
;B[jp];W[dq];B[dp];W[eq];B[fp]
(;W[fq]C[Duncan(W): Should I have played E4?]
(;B[cl]
(;W[dg]C[Duncan (W): This felt clumsy. I was worried about black playing f12 without having a response.]

(;B[db];W[cc];B[dc]
(;W[cb]C[Duncan (W): Not a good move - I fail to see black c16 is more dangerous than it looks.

oslito: nice looking move, but...]
(;B[jc];W[kc];B[hc];W[jd];B[ic];W[he]C[oslito: for me move without purpose:
no territory gain
no attack
no defense
no connection for live
no opponent territory reduction];B[cd]C[oslito: good!];W[de]
;B[bd]C[oslito: good!]
(;W[qq]C[oslito: not good as it can destroy right side]
(;B[mp];W[qp]C[Duncan (W): At this point I feel things are recoverable.]
;B[pq]
(;W[po];B[oo]
(;W[cq]C[Duncan (W): I'm thinking I need to fully establish the life of this group before I try making dents in the black framework. Was it necessary?

oslito: Look at the variation - go is not about single moves, but about sequencies]

(;B[bc]C[oslito: not necesarry, as white had 3 liberties, and black 4 and place to develope]
;W[gp];B[ep];W[gn]C[Duncan (W): I was quite proud of that - but was there a better way to play?

oslito: good move]
(;B[ge]C[Duncan (W): Going into this fight I felt I had a slight advantage. Was I mistaken?

oslito: stong move, white group is in big trouble - all black groups in the area are strong and stable.]

;B[nb];W[la];B[oa];W[pb];B[ji];W[ob];B[ok];W[mi];B[oh]C[Sarah (B): That's my second ladder-blocking move.  I was pleased with that.  I was expecting white to block it somewhere like O15 or K15, but then I'd have had the chance for a follow up on the right hand side.]
;W[qk]C[Duncan (W): I've missed black O15. If I had seen it, where should I have played to prevent giving life to the stones at R14?]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[od];W[oe];B[gi];W[ki];B[ii];W[na]
(;B[kb]LB[gb:A][md:B]C[Sarah (B): I was trying to limit damage here.  Was this a good move?  Or should I just have captured the ko straight away to prevent WQ19 later?

oslito: I would play the ko];W[dn]C[Duncan (W): My objective remains to break down the black framework but I couldn't find any more forcing moves on the left after this. Were there any?]
;B[cn];W[on]C[oslito: VERY strong move - changes status of right side]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[np];W[nn]
(;B[pm]C[Sarah (B): I think this move was a mistake.  I should probably have abandoned Q6 to its fate and played further away from white to block him off.  Like M6, for example, which was his next move.

oslito: the problem is not at the bottom - there is no territory to fight right now...
the important point is right side...];W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn]
;W[jm]TR[qe][qf][oh][ok][pm][pn]C[Duncan (W): I'm feeling pretty pleased by that sequence. I rather suspect black had much better alternatives...

Sarah (B): So do I... White was leading the whole way.

oslito: white leads if he isolates and kills this black stones. in this way he gets loooots of territory]
;B[hk]C[Sarah (B): I think this was my first intelligent move for a while. A bit late.  It did cost me territory in the lower right.]

;W[is];B[kr];W[pa];B[lb];W[ma];B[ka];W[oa];B[jb];W[nd]C[Duncan (W): Was this move strictly necessary?

Sarah (B): I wondered why you did that.  I suppose it secured another point of territory for you.

Duncan (W): I felt I needed to connect the group at N14.

oslito: why not connect if it's in sente? just cost of one big ko thread, but most important for white is to secure right side. for me good move.]

;B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[em];B[el];W[bp];B[dm];W[pr]C[Duncan (W): The following sequence seems to work but I don't understand it well enough to explain it ... which worries me. I'm deliberately sacrificing the group on the left in order to bend around the corner. I'm very aware that I'm fighting for each single point.

Sarah (B): See move 155  for a possible explanation - I gave the wrong response.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[en]C[Sarah (B): This was a bad exchange for me.  Should I have blocked at P3 instead?]
;W[os]
(;B[nq]C[Sarah (B): I think this move lost me the game.  I think if I'd played at O3 I could have secured a half point win from here.]

(;B[jj]C[Duncan (W): I think black at L9 is more dangerous.

Sarah (B): Really?  It looked hopeless to me.  You could take it at any time and it would lose me territory.  I didn't realise at this point that I'd end up fighting a hopeless battle in the RHS.]
;W[kk];B[bn]C[Sarah (B): I'd been intending to play at F5 to kill the two white stones.  But at this point I noticed the damage white could do with a stone at B7 and changed plan hurriedly.  Also realised at this point that I was going to lose unless I could come up with a really good idea...

oslito: right, this is more important now];W[go];B[fo];W[gq]
