C[Hi! Thanks for reviewing my game. I normally play for influence but tried playing for territory in this game. It went ok and I won by a small margin, but I think my opponent missed some opportunities to punish me in the center of the board late in the game. I'm not very good at choosing a direction of play and getting my stones to work together, though I'm weak at everything and will greatly appreciate any and all comments, especially if you notice any recurring themes.

AP:  Hey there appleseeds, this is Alex Prairie, and I will be giving you your review, I hope you enjoy.]

(;B[qj]C[A: R10 is probably better at H16, its a good opportunity to attack white white gaining territory.  Also, R10 is a little bit low.]
;W[dj];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bq]C[I wanted to make my group strong enough to help with any further developments around the bottom, but maybe B3/B4 was a bad exchange?


A: I would stick with F2 in place of B3];W[bp];B[fr]C[AP: At this point, its probably better to move at g4, your group is safe and you can escape the corner]
;W[go];B[hc]C[AP: h16 is probably preferable.  High moves are better on the attack, particularly in this case because white can go on top of your stone at H16, build a wall toward the center and toward his other wall, which will later be a problem for you.]
;W[mc];B[ph]C[I considered r7 instead of q12 but thought it would only provoke white to secure the bottom. How was this opening so far?

AP:  His group at top is still weak, you should attack it and make profit while you still can.  Consider moves at H15 or J16.  Also, if you move at the right side, he will be able to play H16, and really limit your territory.]
;W[cg];B[dl]C[No big points left, so I thought it was time to reduce white's growth a bit. Is that appropriate here? Also, now that I look at this move again, D8 seems one line too deep. Maybe E8? Other options?

AP: This move does seem too deep, but additionally it is too early to reduce.  You have a big point at top, at H15, where you can get your opponent on the run, and gain profit.  Furthermore, P4 seems like a better place to start reduction.]
;W[ek];B[fm]C[i was trying to play lightly (I do tend to avoid contact with enemy stones), but it didn't work at all.]
;W[el];B[em];W[aq];B[fp];W[fo];B[eo];W[en];B[do];W[dn];B[ar]
;W[ap];B[bs];W[dm]C[so this failed...];B[op];W[pq];B[mp]C[trying to stabilize p4 and keep white stones separated. I think I was too focused on preventing white from getting territory here instead of thinking about how black could build.

AP: The purpose of keeping white stones separated is to keep them weak and chase them for profit, however, in this case, the white stones are so strong, there is no reason to separate them.  Consider moving at R5 instead, and building influence towards the center and right side.]

;W[ql];B[lm];W[mo];B[no];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[nr];W[kr]C[I like chasing weak stones, but i'm not very good at it. How should I have gone about this instead?]
;B[he];W[me];B[oe];W[jf];B[hg];W[nb];B[pl];W[pk]C[AP: Here is where you went wrong.  While I agree r9 looks like the natural move, it seems to fail, so I tried Q7 and I think I got slightly better results for black, I included a sequence showing what I saw.]

(;B[qk];W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[ok];B[jl]C[The entire sequence from 69 (Q8) to here seems a little unproductive, and my stones aren't working together. What should I have done instead?]
;W[of];B[pf];W[ob];B[pb];W[nh]
(;B[ci]C[AP: Instead of this move I prefer D12, but that might be wrong.  My friend said he prefers C12.  I included a sequence for D12.]

(;B[lk];W[ml];B[ji];W[id];B[hd];W[ih]C[I didn't see this coming, so the rest of the game features me trying to save the middle stones and catch up after giving w center territory. The endgame saved me, but I'd prefer to not dig a hole in the first place.]

AP:  Thank you for the submission, and sorry it was late.  Your game seems pretty solid, so I didn't include much endgame review.

Some important notes:

When you have the opportunity you should attack your opponent.  He had a stone floating at K16 in the start of the game asking to be attacked.  So you should be more aggressive with attacking to make profit.

Additionally, you should be less aggressive with your invasions.  They seem to be at times a little bit too deep into the opponent territory, which causes problems later.

If you have any questions at all, you can contact me on KGS, (aprairie) and I would love to review more of your games, or even try to find deeper insight into this game, it was very interesting for me and my friends to go through.]
