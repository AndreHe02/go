C[Thank you for helping review my game.
I am black.
I thought i was playing quite ok at the beginning but only realize I lost a big portion of the center and lower left to white.

And I am quite weak at attacking and defending, can you show me how I should have played during my battle with white?]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp];B[jc]C[*This one is most commonly played on J17, but it is playbale.*]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[of];B[mc]C[*This is nice. W jumping at P14 is generally not good. You can punish that later by playing either Q14 or S14.*]
;W[ec]C[*Here you see, why K17 is stronger on J17. As it is now, if B plays on the left side (which is more important), white has a nice two points jump to H17.*]
;B[dc];W[ee];B[cf];W[dj];B[hc]C[Should I have played this? or should I attack lower part of the board?

*this move might be better if you play it later in the game. Yes, it denials the base for white, but white is not really in trouble, as he already jumped to the center with E15. I'd recommend to either play on the lower or the right side. D3 or P3 should be played soon.*]

*to be honest it is too late to attack now. The group on the lower side is not alive yet, so actually b has to play there first. If b wants to attack, maybe a stone on C9 or G4 would help. As an alternative b could try to live in the corner.*]
