C[Hi . thanks for accepting my game . .im playing black ,,

Hello O:];B[cp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[ep];W[jd];B[qf]LB[cf:A]
C[is this move alright?

//Comment  This approach is fine, but you could also consider approaching at A.  I'm not sure which I would prefer.]
;W[ph]LB[of:1][qk:2]C[i dont know how to respond here . . what do you think?

// These are the two thoughts that come to mind]
(;B[qh]C[This move seems alright.];W[pf]C[This seems like a neat choice by white]
;B[pg];W[og];B[qg];W[of];B[pi];W[oh];B[qn]LB[qk:A][ql:B]C[you could also consider A or B as they give you the chinese and micro chinese enclosure.  But right now, the game seems rather even, but I prefer black.]
;W[qj]LB[rd:A]TR[qf][pg][qg][qh]C[This strikes me as premature.  Maybe a move on the left or bottom would be bigger.  This move isn't urgent because the marked group can still live quite easily with A.]
;B[pj]C[this is a good move];W[pk]
(;B[qk]LB[qi:A]C[cutting seems not so good here. I would consider fighting at A]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[pl];W[ok];B[rj];W[pm]
(;B[qm]C[This move is slow.  You could play a ladder breaker on the bottom instead.]
;W[ol]
(;B[ch]C[I would prefer this move to be an approach on the corner, or closer to your enclosure.  This move doesn't leave enough breathing room if white jumps in.]
;W[cj]LB[cf:A]C[This might be premature again.  I'd consider A]
;B[cl]C[0umm is this move alright?

//Comment  This move seems alright to me];W[cf];B[dj];W[ci]
;B[di];W[bh]
(;B[dh];W[bg];B[ck];W[bk]C[mistake, white doesn't need this move, should just take sente]
;B[bl];W[bj]C[the game seems even again.  White's upper right corner is still open, and black's bottom isn't secure.  Both black and white have center facing walls.  White has a lot of potential, but Black has a lot of territory.]
;B[dc]LB[db:3][eb:2][pb:B][fc:1][nc:A][qc:C][jp:D]C[i just try to invade haha

//  White is a bit strong here.  You could maybe try to work White's upper right corner instead with A, B, or C.  Black could try to build up the bottom with D.  I'm not so sure of this move, I don't think I would play it.  If you want to play in this area, i'd suggest 1, 2, or 3.]
;W[ec]LB[eb:1]
(;B[cc]C[This move seems like you are expecting to much from white to let you live here.]
;W[eb];B[cd];W[ba];B[bb]LB[de:A]TR[cf][bg][bh][ci][bj][cj][bk]
C[you should escape while you can at A.  Although, maybe it's best to just let these stones die, running would be more painful since white's marked group is pretty strong.]

interesting game, and a fun opening variation.  I've pointed out a few mistake and a lot of what I think.  I think you should go through this a couple times to see what you think, if you agree or not.  :)]
