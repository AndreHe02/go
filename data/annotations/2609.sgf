C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I have absolutely no idea where I'm going wrong, but it seems as though no matter what I try, I fall very far behind very early in the game and have to try to catch up.  In this game, I thought I did a fairly good job of catching up, but was stunned to find that I was much further behind than I thought.

What is probably the most frustrating thing of all is that I try things that work well for my opponents when they play such moves against me -- in this case, the pincer attacks.  But when I try them, the result seems to be almost immediate disaster.
  It doesn't help, either, that I usually end up using far more time than my opponents -- they seem to be able to come up with good moves right off the bat, while I could look at the board for quite a long time, and still come up with a clunker.

I suppose there must be something fairly simple and obvious that I'm doing wrong, but I certainly can't find it.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger
Fedya on KGS];B[pd]C[Hi Ted.

From your words, I feel you are bit stressed out from your situation. But don't let this turn into a fear that appears everytime you face a situation which makes you feel you have no choice.

In such situations, take the simplest option. And stick to the basic principles like

attack when you are strong.
always defend your weak your weak groups.
stay away from your opponent if he is strong etc.];W[dp];B[qp]
;W[dc]C[Ted: I had a feeling (correctly, as it turned out) that Black was going to play a shimari in the bottom right on his next turn.  But I played in the unoccupied corner because the last time I asked a stronger player about a similar situation, I was told that it's not necessary to respond immediately to stop my opponent from making a shimari.

Arcin:

If you are feeling very uneasy you may try to break that. But you will start playing the game the way your opponents wants to play it and this is psychologically very weakening. Believe in the power of your moves. 

Of course he will play a shimari and then you will have a chance to play yours :)]
;B[oq];W[nc]C[Ted: I thought about playing at R10, but the last time I did that, I was told that Black had the choice of which way he wants to push me, which makes it better for Black to have me play there than for me.  Besides, this move should serve as a good extension from D17.

Arcin : The reasoning is good. (I would still be tempted to play R10, to break the perfect shape for black)]
;B[pf]
(;W[kd]C[Ted: I didn't play at K16 because whenever I do, my opponents split the two stones by playing M16 or M17.

Arcin: it should be K16. this is close. why? look at the var.]

(;B[cn];W[cl]C[Ted: This is where everything started going wrong.  I played the pincer attack for three reasons:

1) It serves as a good extension from D17, and stronger players have suggested that playing such an extension is a good thing when it also serves as a pincer attack.

2) I thought it would put pressure on the C6 stone.

3) My opponents always get a good position when they play pincer attacks against me, so I always hold out hope that I too can get a good position from a pincer attack just once.

Yet things quickly spiralled out of control from here.

A: first two reasons are good :)];B[en];W[fp]C[Ted: So far, so good -- I think.]
;B[hq]LB[cp:B][gq:A][fr:A]TR[dp][fp]C[Arcin: I will write at the top if that's all right.

First, you should not worry about losing your eye space. It is not very easy to lose it. 

Second, try to assess the strength of the groups involved in this. Your opponent actually might have put himself in danger by changing directions. But it looks like his idea was just to catch you off guard. Now is such a situation to play it safe.

How about attacking the two Black stones and ignore the H3 attack? for now at least.

Black will HAVE TO respond. He will run outside. And you will follow. After this small chase you will have a much better position to respond to H3.

------

Ted: This move presents me with serious problems.  No matter how much I look, I can't figure out where White is supposed to get eyes for the D/F4 stones.  Either of the points marked 'A', and the point marked 'B', seem to be miai.  I figured that if I played at B, Black could play under my two stones at F2 and take away eye-space, but if I play at G3, Black can respond with B4 and take away eye-space.  The other move in the corner that I thought about was E3, but that doesn't look very good either.  One other alternative might be K3, but after Black responds with H5, I don't see where White can get two eyes.  And I also don't think that sacrificing the two stones could possibly be the right strategy.

It seems as though every time there's a pincer attack, I get the short end of the stick.  If my opponent pincers me, I end up with a weak group; if I pincer my opponent, both of my groups end up weak.  I can't recall the last time I got a good position out of a pincer attack.  I guess there must be some trick to it that I can't spot.]

(;W[go]LB[ch:B][kq:A]C[Ted: After quite a lot of thought, this is what I played.  I have a feeling it's the losing move, but I decided that trying to run out to the center and make eyes was the least bad idea.  (Stronger players have suggested running out into the center to me, but I find that getting eyes in the center is always easier said than done.)

Arcin: this is nice too, a bit like a splitting attack... Marked areas are continuations for White AND Black. Kind of miai.]
;B[ce]LB[ce:1][ch:B][ci:A][cn:2][hq:3]C[Arcin: Here black makes a big mistake and it is time for white to punish him. You should not let such moves slip. At this point black has created 3 weak groups. Time to punish them... To one easiest to punish is number 2.

A or B are too possible attacks. A is much more solid and takes away any trouble that may occur after B is played (After B, black may want to complicate things by splitting you with a play at C10... )]

(;W[cg]C[Ted: It's probably a bad idea, but I tried another pincer attack again.  I was hoping that I could get the chance to play either D11 or D10, which would give me a nice chunk of territory along the side.

ARcin: the idea is correct but it is too close. Dont forget that a pincer does not need to be 1 space away. It is still a pincer if you play C11.]
;B[ci]C[Ted: Black deftly prevents this.];W[eg]C[Ted: Would D15 have been better?]
;B[ee];W[fc];B[ei];W[gg];B[gm]
(;W[io]C[Arcin:

things got complicated but, look at it like this. your single stone is captured. Well, why don't you capture his stones in return or at least harrass them?? The candidate is at the top left corner. See variation...

I guess you were tempted to play this move because you thought it was in danger. It is not. H3 is very weak.]
;B[kq]C[Arcin: you gave a chance to Black to strengthen his positin.]
;W[fr]C[Ted: I have a feeling this is a really bad move, and that Black should have responded with E3.  But I can't see where running further is going to get me eyes, either.

Arcin: you may need to play a move inside here, right. but i feel you are giving away too much from your territory. B4 is still open for Black. Suggestion? well, maybe C3/C4.]
;B[qj];W[qn]TR[ce][ee]C[Ted: To be honest, I felt quite desperate when I played this move.  I felt that the only chance I had was to take away a big chunk of territory from Black along the right side, *and* to kill the stones in the top left.

Arcin: i can say one thing: Black is happy to see you there. That gives him a chance to attack you... You could have attacked the stones at the top left and then this move could be a better move, at this move it is giving Black chance to attack you.]
;B[ql];W[on];B[ln];W[qh]C[Ted: I left the stones in the bottom right for the time being, thinking that they were dead.  By now I was getting even more desperate.

Arcin : you let them die, ok. :) But why are you giving Black another stone to kill? :)))

as you are saying, you have lost control here. last three have no aim.]

(;W[hc]C[Ted: I should probably have played S15 immediately.  After all, the stones in the top right should be dead if Black plays S14.  But this was part of the plan to kill the Black stones in the top left.

ARcin: i don't understand? how does this plan work? I mean to kill black at the top left? the last 10 moves you played have no effect (if not a worsening effect) on those stoenes. black now has a wall facing that direction. it is very far, correct but this definitely not helping you to kill those two stones.]

(;W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[do]TR[hr]C[Arcin: look at the board... there bigger moves. example: top right, saving your stoners on the right. this group can still extend a bit more.]

;W[es]LB[cs:B][gs:A]C[Ted: At least I've succeeded in making unconditional life here.  I'll get one eye at E3/E2, while A and B are miai for making a second eye.]
;B[pc]C[ARcin: that was big.];W[re];B[rd];W[se];B[sd];W[sg]
C[Ted: Black lets me live here, too.  Obviously, my opponent had a much better idea of just how far behind I was than I did.

Arcin: yhes, if i were black, i would kill you first. i believe that is bigger.]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[jh];W[cc]TR[ce][ee]C[Ted: Was this move necessary to kill the Black stones?

Arcin: well, black can complicate things easily around there. but you are far behind, so you should be trying to make the game equal not give up sente.]
;B[lh];W[ff]C[Arcin: this definitely is unnecessary. you can fight there easily even if black cuts.]
;B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[bf]C[Ted: So, I'm able to kill the Black stones.  This is about the best result I can recall getting from a pincer attack in a long, long time.  What I didn't see was just how much it cost me elsewhere on the board.

Arcin: first move C17 was a maybe but other two were no, no. you should not have played them.]

C[Ted: Amazingly, Black has let me connect the stones on the left side and the right side.  The only stone I end up losing is the pincer stone at C8.

At this time, I had a feeling I was still behind, but I didn't realize just how far behind I was.  I thought I was losing by around 15 points, yet I went on to lose by about 40.  I found the final margin to be exceedinly depressing, because it meant that Black was able to play slack for the last three-fourths of the game (not killing the group in the top right, doing nothing to save the stones in the top left), yet I was still slaughtered.

Arcin: just do a quick count:
White: 7 (right) + 4(bottom) + 50 top
Black: 24 (bottom) + 35 (left) +30(centeR)];B[op];W[mn];B[mm]

C[Ted: I was absolutely stunned when the final score showed that I had lost by 40 points.  I thought I had only lost by 15-20 points.

Arcin: as for adivce: try to identify weak/strong groups in the games and play accordingly, especially in the beginning. It is not very easy to kill groups in the beginning, so don't be afraid. 

and as you realize, the first 40 moves defines the rest, so be more careful with your moves at the beginning.

and at the end: don't follow your opponent when chosing which area of the board to play, you may find better places to play. you may be suprised how much difference that makes in the score....

you easily lost 10 points in the endgame alone.

I hope the review was helpful.
