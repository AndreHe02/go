C[Dear reviewer,
In this game I played white and gave up after circa 160 moves.

In many of my games I have some points where I dont have any ideas how to go on...or I only see moves with bad follow ups.

I hope you can give me some hints or ideas on the marked positions and maybe criticism of the local or fighting errors I made during the whole game.

Thank you for investing your time and effort!];B[pd]C[Hello,

Just a quick note before the review :
It's been a long time since I haven't been sollicited for a review, so I'm very happy to start the year with a review :-)

[commercial mode\]
Also, the review it performed on qgo2, which is the smartest go client and editor that I know of.
[/commercial mode\]];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[mc]MA[ce]LB[di:A][jd:B]
[qj:C]C[first point:
I thought about those points shown,
A seemed a bit too slow
C is a good target for black to stabilise his groups and at the same time removing my eyespace for C

so I took B, if black plays between, then I take the corner and left side and have agi on B for later
or black attacks from c15 or something then I can stabilise my both stones on the top, that was the idea behind it.

But: I dont really know what I can do here


The development rules tell the order :

1a corner first
1b enclose your corner if you have a 3-4 stone
1c prevent opponent enclosure (3-4 stones)

When corner are dealt with :
2a play the 'biggest' extension on the side
2b play on your side

When extentions are dealt with
3 invade (play in opponents terrritory)


Therefore, the move here is C15.

Your thinking is not a mistake, but it does not secure your corner.
The Chinese at A is also correct, if you know how to use it. I'd play C15.]
;W[jd];B[ce];W[ee]MA[cd]C[I' prefer to shut and settle the corner, but E15 is not a mistake anyway.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[dg]C[error from black I think, this move should be on c17 I think

Correct]
(;W[cd]MA[cc]C[I don't like this move.
Atari is 'usually' a bad move.

Here, you lose sente, and aji, and a ko threat

If you want the corner (very big move, but still gote), play at C17, which is sente (see variation)]
;B[de];W[cc];B[ef]TR[nq]MA[dj][ff]C[second point:

Again a situation I dont know what to do...
maybe I have to take gote and secure my group in the upper left, in this case I didnt see that.

So I was searching for a good tenuki point....
I choosed r6 but I dont know if this move was good



Ok, there you can still apply the development rules, if there is no other emergency. Your upper left group is safe anyway.

The other corner is flexible (don't play C6/C7 since the left side is devaluated), so you should extend, if there is any extension available.

So, to that regard, the biggest extension (i.e. the most potential bearing) is O3.

However, one could argue that the black goup should be dealt with.

There are two possible variations, which i don't like very much.]
(;W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[qj];B[jq];W[cl]MA[cm]
[qf]C[correct, but maybe a liitle slack. I'd play C7, or even R14]
(;B[cj]C[bad move. black should not make a cramped extension from its strength, see variation.]
;W[bj]C[acceptable.

I'd prefer E8, but your move is correct to me.];B[bi];W[ck]
;B[dj];W[fq]MA[eq]C[too wide. E3 is better there];B[cq]C[This is the sanction, of course ...]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[eq];W[ep];B[fr];W[gq];B[ar]
(;W[er]C[Don't !

The idea of sacrificing a stone to shut at G2 is correct, but you can have the same result by playing G2 directly.

The result of E2 is that black is unconditionnally alive after white G2.

If you play G2, you still have ko threats ...];B[dr];W[gr];B[es]
LB[ff:B][fo:D][np:E][qc:C][qf:A]C[third point:
same question here, I think I can take sente, but where to play here?

A secures the ladder at f4 but it gives black a reason to secure his upper right corner. To good for black in my opinion.

There is no ladder ... If B F4, W G5 ...

B doesnt give me an advantage, I think black is lucky with f13 after B

Correct

C could work, but I was afraid of an invasion of black somewhere at g17 after getting a wall at q16

No emergency with C. There are other big points on the board.

D is to slow and defensiv in this situation I think
so I took E;  attack as the best defense

Correct. O3 is also possible.];W[np]C[good];B[po];W[lq]C[Ok, but you have a problem at R7 now ...]

;B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[or];B[oq];W[nq];B[pr];W[op];B[pq]MA[qc]
C[fourth point:
same question:
where to place a stone?
I choosed l8 to attack and secure a possible connection to the rigth stones...but I coul also attack upper rightor reducing the moyo of black in the center....

Look at the board :
emergencies first : I d'ont see any (apart R7), but you don't risk life here.

black weak groups ? none really.

So you should go for the BIG points on the board.

- The exchange WR14 B S16 is too good for black.

Therefore, I would invade at R17, and cope with the center afterwards.]
;W[kl];B[qm];W[ql];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[om]TR[pm]C[Here you lose sente.
Q7 is not important, so you should not lose sente at its expense.]
;B[jb]C[big, but not crucial. R17 still open.];W[lc]C[Here I thought I should not be defensive cause I should be behind in points, so I attacked
Probably not in the best way or with the best result]

;B[ec];W[fc];B[eb];W[fb];B[gd];W[fd];B[ge]C[fifth point:
Probably I can give up at this stage of the game cause I dont see how white can get a big moyo to balance the territory of black.

but where should I play here?

The game is still balanced if you count the points on the sides.

Now, there is a problem in the center, but the game key is not in the center ...

The key is to ATTACK your opponent weackness, and territorry is a by-product that will come by itself.

If you can attack successfully a weak formation, and drive it to the center, you will destroy the center.

look at the Q16 stones ... and the proposed variation]

;B[na]C[Well thats it!

I give up cause I should have not that much territory than black...but I didnt count over the whole game

Thx once more!


Ok, there are 3 comments I would make, that can be usefull to you :

1) use the development rules I gave you at move 5. I don't remember which book they come from, but they have been written by some japanese 9p ...

2) The essence of go is 'attack' or, more elegantly 'unbalance'. You played very correctly at move 46. 
Whenever you wonder where to play, consider this order :
- do I have an emergency (life issue, etc ...). SECURITY FIRST
- is there a weakness in my opponent that I can aim at ? ATTACK, and put him off balance
- if not, play at moyo frontier.
- if no moyo frontier, play big moves on the side, OR make influence to control the center.

3) beware your weaknesses.
R7 made the black group alive
L16 made you lose big.

I hope this review was usefull.
