AB[dd][pd][dp]C[ONO2128: Hi!
Parsec: Hi!
ONO2128: Thank you for the game.];W[pp]C[Parsec: Hope we have a good game!
Parsec: And I thank you too!];B[qf];W[qm];B[gc];W[pq]C[This isn't a good opening move.  Playing along the left side would be better.]
;B[cf];W[jp];B[cn];W[pi];B[md]SQ[nc]C[Good.  Black wants to prevent a white invasion of the upper right corner.

I think that O17 does a better job of defending the corner, however.]
;W[mi];B[jd]SQ[dj][fq]C[This isn't the best choice here.  The lower left corner isn't secure.  

F3 is probably the best move for either player. 

Playing around D10 would also be better than the current move.

In the opening, a good rule of thumb is to look for the largest open area and play in it.  The largest open area currently is between C14 and C6.]
;W[nc]TR[pc]SQ[pi][mi]C[Black has to decide how to respond to this invasion.  The two basic options are trying to kill white and trying to drive white into the center.

As a general rule, unless you are very sure that you can kill your opponent, driving him into the center is usually the best choice.  If you are black and receiving a handicap, then white is probably better at making life.  This makes trying to kill white more risky.

Here white can run towards the marked stones on the right side. So in this case driving white into the center is less appealing than it would normally be.

Black's stones in this area are all on the 4th line.  This leaves more room for white to try making 2 eyes.

So, in this case, neither option is obviously better.

I would play the next black stone on Q17.  It solidly defends the upper right corner.  It also reduces white's space for making eyes.]
;B[qh]SQ[qi]C[Black should deal with white's invasion before attacking white. Also, white is already very strong here.  Black's move invites white to block at R11 and secure territory around R9 at the same time.

Don't play a move that forces your opponent to respond with a move that he would like to play anyway]
;W[nd]SQ[pc][qi]C[White has decided to run out into the center.  This isn't bad, but blocking at R11 and attaching at Q17 are both better.  Those 2 spots are also good moves for black.]

(;B[ne]TR[dj][fq][qj][qi][mc][pc]SQ[pi][mi]C[With the 2 marked white stones, trying to cut white off from the center is not likely to work.  Also, trying to cut white off isn't going to make much territory for black.  The triangles are all better choices for black.

In general, you don't have to kill your oppoent's groups.  Here, black should not try to cut off an kill white now that white is trying to run out into the center.  Black should keep pressure on white so that white has to spend several moves saving these stones.  At the same time, black is building strength and territory.

See Variation.];W[oe];B[of];W[od];B[pe]SQ[nf][me]C[White's stones are in an inefficient clump, which is good for black.  Black has cutting points at N15 and O14, which is bad for black.]
;W[me];B[nf];W[ld];B[mc]TR[md]SQ[oe][od][nd][nc]C[Now we have a capture race.  Both weak groups have 2 liberties and it is white's turn.  This means that black is probably going to lose.  Black should start looking for ways to gain something else in exchange.]
;W[lc];B[oc]C[Good.  This forces white to capture stones that are already dead, and it helps secure the upper right corner at the same time.]
;W[mb];B[nb]SQ[ob]C[Black is leaving too many cutting points again.  P18 is better.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[qa]C[This is an end game move and gains about 2 points for black. There are a lot of other moves worth more than 2 points still available, however.

I think that the upper right corner is secure without this move. But if black is not certain of this, then playing this move to secure the corner is reasonable.

So, whether or not this is good move depends on black's reasoning in choosing it.]
;W[qi]TR[dj][jc]SQ[fq]MA[eq][er][es][ds][dr][dq]C[This is a big move for white, but it is also Gote.  Black doesn't have to respond.  Black should step back and look at the whole board for the best move.

I think that F3 is still the best move.  If black plays here first, then the 6 marked intersections will be black territory. If white plays here first, then most or all of the marked intersections will Not be territory for black.

The triangles are also good moves for black.];B[ri]C[This is another end game move.  It is, at least, Sente.  

Still, always look at the whole board for the moves worth the most points]
;W[rj];B[sj]SQ[ri][qh]C[Black keeps making this same pattern of 3 unconnected stones. This is bad.  Stop and look very hard for other moves if you find yourself about to make this shape.]
;W[sk];B[si]SQ[rh]C[At this point, black is going to lose some stones.  Black should cut his losses by playing at S12 instead.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[sh];B[sg];W[jj]
(;B[pg]C[Black has had a lot of problems with cutting points so far.  This move protects some potential cutting points for black.  In this case, however, white can't gain much by trying to cut here, so black can save this move for the endgame.  

See the variation];W[ph];B[qg];W[gp]C[White's approach is too high.  It should be on the third line, or possibly the second line.]
;B[dh]SQ[fq]C[This move isn't bad since white's last move it not much threat to the lower right corner.  This means that black doesn't have to defend the lower left corner.

The current move changes the score by about 4 points.   

Playing at F3 changes the score by about 12 points, however. I say 12 points because black would gain about 6 points and white would lose about 6 points, so the score shifts 12 points in black's favor.]
;W[ck]SQ[ek]
(;B[cj]C[White has invaded.  Black can try to surround white, or black can try to drive white out into the center.

E9 would be best for surrounding white.  Don't try to surround by playing in contact with you opponent.  Playing 1 space away generally works better.

See variation for surrounding and killing

White is trying to make territory in the center.  Black would like to reduce this.  Chasing white into the center can also help reduce the center.  Black should try to play moves that attack white's weak group and reduce the center at the same time. White will only be able to block one of these, so black should come out ahead either way.

;W[id];B[ge];W[ie];B[if];W[je];B[gg]SQ[fn][fq]C[This does secure black's top left territory, but there are still moves worth more on the board.  I still think that F3 is the best move.  F6 is also good for reducing white.]

If white plays next on J7, the center territory will be more secure.  Black will then play at G10 and cut off the 3 white stones on the left side.

If white plays at G10, then the 3 stones on the left side are probably safe but black has a chance to reduce white's center.]
