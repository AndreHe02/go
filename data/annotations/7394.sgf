C[Hi, I'm Marc from Germany currently studying Baduk in Korea and about 3d. I will leave some final comment at the move, where the review ends.]

;B[cc];W[cb];B[dd];W[db];B[id]TR[gd]C[This move looks strange, the aji with white later cutting at the triangled spot looks dangerous. Usually this stone is one to the left.  Still I would continue with B17 for W and not Tenuki, since this move is is important for the base of both groups here.]

C[Next strange move by Black, jumping is usual];W[qq];B[qk]

(;W[kp];B[iq]LB[kp:A][iq:B]C[EmTom: Bad exchange?

M: definatly, forcing B to solidify his group, making points and preparing the approach to you corner can barely be good]
;W[qc]C[EmTom: I am not sure if its the correct idea to invade san-san right now... What do you think?

M: K4 is much much more urgent. Even though your exchange at the bottom was bad, now there is no way, to leave K4 unplayed, because it will be really painful to see B playing it (in almost sente) getting both, territory and thickness. I also don't like sansan for Top right, since i would still aim at the G16 weakness. (so i would approach from O17) But calm players might sansan here.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]LB[od:A][rd:B]C[EmTom: Would A be better joseki choice? I would have the corner and top side is open anyway...

M: I would also prefer to keep the corner, A or B both do the same here]
;W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb]LB[fb:A][mb:B]C[EmTom: It seems to me now that A and B do the same thing... I played like that cause I was looking for oportunities to attack top left black group. What do you think about it?

M: yes an attack there is necessary, but needs some preparation on the right side before, i think. Still, K4 is most urgent]
;W[bc];B[cn]C[With the group above baseless and the Aji of G16, i think, that's an overplay here for black]

(;W[gq]C[??? - with K4 unplayed you don't have any kind of attack against the bottom group anyway, in this case you are only damaging your 3 stones facing the center. To counterattack, pincering looks fine here. If you want to settle the situation quickly (imho too defensive here, but possible) just small keima (F3) would be enough, especially since it reduces the aji at sansan a lot.]
;B[jp]C[ouch...];W[co]LB[cp:A]C[EmTom: This move should be at A doesnt it...
M: yes, it should]

C[why? making black stronger and giving him good shape without achieving anything.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[fo];B[go];W[fp];B[gn]C[Now blacks group has no weaknesses anymore.]
;W[no]C[necessary, but painful];B[on]C[passing would have the same effect, Usually black should be happy about free sente here, but that's a waste of a move]
;W[hh]C[too passive to me, white can connect unter at any time, so i would start to attack with G16 immediatly, since this move has no effect on the group below anymore]
;B[if];W[gc]C[This one has to be one space below, you just force Black to connect without getting anything]
;B[ge]
(;W[me]C[EmTom: I thought that I will be able to reduce right side while attacking black. It seems this plan didnt work. Any suggestions?

M: yes, the idea is okay, but hard to attack, blacks groups is already almost alive, probaly just a deep reduction/ invasion would be better]
;B[ng];W[lg];B[lc]
(;W[mc]C[why not O16?];B[ld]
(;W[ne]C[unneccassary, black can not cut, wasted move, you should continue your attack]
;B[of];W[jc]C[looks desperate but white has to try something, so good attempt]

(;B[jh]
(;W[kf]C[this ruins the game completly. If you just want to capture the 2 single black stones there, this move might be okay, but if you are aiming for the big one, then you just force black to remove all remaining cutting aji, getting a completly useless stone. Black will be very happy to make this exchange]
;B[jg];W[li];B[ij];W[be];B[nj]C[black has a clear territorial lead and the game is over]
;W[ef];B[gd];W[ji]C[it is too late to cut now, L14 buried any aji]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[ii];W[ih];B[ki];W[jj];B[kj];W[jk];B[lh];W[mh]
;B[kh];W[mg];B[nh];W[lj];B[kk];W[lk];B[jl];W[qj]C[EmTom: Now I started to play like a mad man... It seems that blacks position is very comfortable though... I feel that the game was decided earlier so you can stop your review here if you feel that way too.

M: yes, the game is over already, further comments unneccessary. 
Main mistake during the whole game was your attacking style and the way you used aji. You often removed aji in opponents groups in unneccessary ways, forcing your opponent into good exchanges (for him), and missed the right timing for your attacks. You did not attack severe enough to pose a serious threat, instead you just helped you opponent, eliminating his weaknesses. Then you got in a difficult situation and suddenly you tried to do the impossible (which was possible before you wasted the aji) with K11, but your opponent did not let you fool him and punished in a good way. You should ask yourself more often during playing, when you make an exchange, if the exchange is good for you, and what does it achieve. The fact that it might be sente does not make it good by itself. 
If there are any more questions, feel free to ask me again ;)]
