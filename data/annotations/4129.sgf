;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp]C[I realize now that 3-4 point play is a bit easier for beginners

- its all about personal preference, in my opinion.];W[dq];B[pj]
;W[nq]C[Knight Approach.]
(;B[oq]C[In retrospect, black should jump at Q6 as the "standard' response to the knight approach.

- contact moves should be avoided. R6, M3 or O4 are common josekis that you can use.]
;W[np]C[ksumi-tsuke.];B[pm]C[Seems natural to me to play here with regard to Q10. Is this bad?

- its too far for a 4th line move. this might present a problem later on if/when W gets desperate enough or strong enough take advantage of the aji on the 3rd line.]
;W[hd];B[md]C[K16 better? "if one, jump two, if two jump three"

-K16 is too close. but examine the board, is N16 or K16 really the biggest points to play? D10, K4, K3 are all pretty big.]
;W[hp]LB[jp:A]C[Playing at K4 here seems to make sense. However, K16 seems consistent with area to the top right.

-Pretty passive way of playing. Right now, it feels like B is doing a little better, but W still has much potential to win.]
;B[jd];W[de];B[dg]C[-D10?];W[do];B[dm]C[-??? Why make two weak groups? Why not D10 to begin with, and see which side W favors?]
;W[qf]C[- good move by W. you are very weak on the left side, but its much more favorable for W to break your huge moyo on the right.]

(;B[qe];W[pf]C[kosumi-tsuke

- why play contact move to begin with? wouldnt R12 be a perfect move with regard to your bottom right hand side? it's two birds with one stone, no pun intended.]
;B[re]C[Here i am at a loss. What is the proper response to the kosumi-tsuke pattern after Q14? In this case, I see joseki patterns extending from Q16 to O16. Is that a better play in this situation? I thought I wanted to avoid the cut at S15 by white.

- this shows that you are afraid of counter-attacking. this means that W has a good possibility of living in your territories and gives W some confidence. also, your 4th line stones at the right arent really that strong, so you must consider those in your strategy.]
;W[ph];B[oh]C[tsuke. "Playing a tsuke 'out of the blue' is often not a good strategy. By touching the opponent's stone, you are forcing it to defend and thus get strong, probably stronger than your own stone. "

Perhaps R12 was a wiser, similar play.

-its never good to play contact moves when you are trying to contain/kill an enemy. R12 would've been better... several moves ago! R11 would be a safer move, but requires some followup.

- right now, i'd rather play D10 since Q12 group is going to be hard to kill.]
;W[og];B[nh]C[tsukenobi

-why push to the middle when you have nothing to lose there? defend at D10!]
;W[mf];B[ej]C[- too far, but you finally have a chance to play here.]
;W[rf];B[sf]C[-wasted move, better at R11!];W[cf];B[cg];W[cn]
;B[cm]C[THe last two responses by black are predicated completely on a familiar pattern seen in the game twice so far (Q16 area and Q4 area). They seem natural moves to me. Is this correct play?

-this is a natural response and is good for B. he forces to you to live, and there is some aji in both of his corners.]
;W[mn];B[nm]C[- this isnt the best move against N6... W is obviously trying to increase his potential on the bottom, so you must counter-attack by either destroying some of his territory... or to make some more of your own! you still have many 4th line stones that desperately need reinforcement.]
;W[km];B[ll];W[ic];B[id]C[Push at J16 is Basic Instinct.

-K17 is the natural move. your instinct tells you to be passive and aggressive at the wrong times. tune out your instinct and play with your mind!]
;W[kb];B[kc];W[jb];B[lb];W[la]C[- now look at what happened! you lost about 10 points on top!]
;B[ma]C[- bad shape.]
(;W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[gn]C[I find this move perplexing when I review this game. Perhaps F8 is better?

-G6 is a... well... its a bad move. It forces W to strengthen his shape, which is never good.]
;W[en];B[em];W[gl];B[gk]C[- ???];W[he];B[ie]C[- K14 is better suited. avoid the empty triangle shape]
;W[hn];B[go]C[Wasted move in my view. These stones are dead to me.]
;W[il];B[ij]C[Contact play at J9 may be better?

- J9 is useless to B and to W. play R11!];W[bn];B[bm];W[mb]
;B[ka];W[rh]C[I should address this play immediately, but I don't.]

(;B[nb];W[sg]
(;B[se]C[Is thi sforced. It seemed to be to me when I played it.

-S10 instead.];W[rj]C[This move makes me very uncomfortable along the right. Perhaps a better sequence of moves the past several for Black would be most helpful.]
;B[rk];W[qg];B[qj];W[gd];B[sk];W[qi];B[pe];W[nr];B[or]C[A sequence of purely reactive moves by black. I'm lost in the aether of this game.]
;W[lg];B[lh]C[Lack of knowledge on Diagonal playing hurts here. Perhaps L14 is a better move? Is the move played bad in any way? The idea behind it is to protect space between the played stone and J10.]
;W[kh];B[ki]C[- ??? you must think of the shape you are making before you play! this will not bode well for you.]
;W[mh];B[li]C[Basic Instinct. From Atari, Extend.];W[mi]
(;B[ni];W[ng];B[mj];W[jh];B[mg]C[Well, as a beginner, getting two stones in a capture is akin to Euphoria!

-you can also achieve Euphoria through the use of certain drugs, this doesn't mean its good! (dont use drugs btw!)]
;W[jf];B[ke]C[I felt that the group in J16 may have been weak. This seems to strengthen them somewhat...

-there are many things wrong with this group. shape, etc. go back and see what I wrote with regard to J16 move.]

- J8 gives W a strong shape. You wont be able to break W.];W[ag]
;B[ah];W[af];B[bh];W[hh];B[fh]C[Is contact here at G12 a better move?

-when you must ask if a contact play is good, envision the results. how can W respond, and how does that benefit you? I dont feel that just simply telling you "contact moves suck, except on certain occassions" will be a good enough explanation. you seem to like playing contact moves, but you fail to realize the consequences of playing those moves. contact moves are played if you want to fight. contact moves usually result in forcing the other player to strengthen his/her group. there are few scenarios where you can play an unforced contact move which will bring you superior results.]

my advice would be to play more slowly and to think about your options. there were many moves in the game where i felt B limited himself to very few options, or just blatantly ignored other options. this is a game of endless possibilities - the more possibilities you can envision, the better the player you will become. work on your shortcomings, such as shape assessment and overall board position assessment.

i enjoyed reviewing this game. i wish you luck in the future.
