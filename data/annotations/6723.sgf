C[Dear reviewer,

this is a tournament game i (black) played against a German 1 kyu.

I misread in the beginning, but i was able to turn the game around later. Everything was chaotic and there are few "simple" moves.

I'd greatly appreciate if you could comment on my mistakes. I'm especially interested in tesuji.

Thank you very much!

Hi Sebastian!

My name is Jon and I'll be providing the analysis for your game.   My comments are marked with "Jon:" at the beginning.]
;B[pd]
(;W[cd]C[Jon:  When playing white, it's important to watch which direction you place a 3-4 stone in the corner when black has 4-4 stones in play.  You don't want to give black an ideal approach move from his 4-4 stone, but that's what happened here.]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[ed]LB[pd:A]C[Jon:  A good move, this is an ideal approach from black's top right corner at A.]

(;W[hd]TR[ed]C[Jon:  It's harder to attack black with his ideal setup, but this pincer feels too loose, it allows black's pincered stone to move out easily and counterattack.

What would be a better way to pincer?];B[ef]C[Jon:  The correct plan, black will have a comfortable time counterattacking white's pincer stone.]
;W[cf]
(;B[kd]C[Jon:  Too early!   When you're counterattacking a two point pincer, you need to build more strength first before launching the counterattack.]
;W[dh]
(;B[hf]TR[ed][ef]C[Sebastian:  This seemed to be the natural move.

Jon:  While it may seem natural, black's shape in relation to the marked stones is very thin, so I'm  concerned about that.  I'd prefer to move out more carefully.]
;W[ec]TR[ed][ef][hf]C[Jon:  As black, this attachment now worries me with the thin shape of the marked stones.]

(;B[fc];W[fd]
(;B[gc]C[Sebastian:  I misread the ladder here - there is no ladder >_<

Jon: ><   I provided another route to consider in the variation.]
;W[gd];B[dc];W[eb];B[db];W[ee];B[dd];W[hc];B[fb];W[gb];B[ea]
;W[de];B[fe];W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[ge];W[he];B[fh];W[fg]C[Sebastian:  Black is surprised - there is no ladder >_<
Very very stupid. Should i resign?

Jon:  Nah, the game's still perfectly playable, so you can safely continue.]

(;B[do]C[Jon:  Because white has a lot of strength above, I would prefer to play more defensively (i.e. play with the aim of getting a base) and use a low approach.]
;W[cm]
(;B[dm]LB[hh:A][cm:B]TR[gf][fg][gg][dh]C[Sebastian:  I thought that i need to play unusual moves to be able to win. I wanted to play the A sequence soon and try to build a big right side.

Jon:  You don't really need to play too unusually, the game's not that far gone yet.  As for this move, I'd prefer to use something else, the marked stones will make the stone at B harder to counterattack, so I don't think black'll be able to get a good result here.]
;W[dl];B[eg];W[eh];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[if];B[gh];W[hf];B[em]
;W[cn];B[co]TR[dh][eh]C[Sebastian:  I was happy with this result. Black is behind, but he has potential.

Jon:  Hum...  I'm not really happy with this for black, as he's now forced to stabilize this group, but he won't be able to get much from it due to white's strength above.]
;W[fp]C[Sebastian:  Is this a good move for white?

Jon:  Definitely, this is perfectly fine.]
(;B[hq]TR[dh][eh]C[Sebastian:  I needed to play agressive. I considered G12 to be helpful in the fight.

Jon:  This is a dangerous overplay though, as it forces white to separate your groups.  As for the G-12 stones, they need to be closer to be of more assistance.  There's also white's marked stones, which are pivotal here.]

(;W[gr]LB[go:A]C[Sebastian:  This was odd. i expected white to play at A.

Jon:  This is very odd, but also extremely submissive, so the kosumi at A is a must.]

(;B[go]C[Sebastian:  Black's center looks promising. The game becomes even again, i think.

Jon:  Black *is* getting nice influence in the center, but because it's still very loose and open, it's hard to know how much you'll actually get right now.]

(;W[hr]C[Jon:  Another small move.  White really needs to get to the right side.]

(;B[iq]LB[pj:A]C[Sebastian:  Is this move slow?

Jon:  Yeah, I'd want to get to the right side with A now.];W[qj]
;B[ql]C[Jon:  A good decision, you have better prospects on the bottom.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of]
(;B[pi]LB[nd:A]TR[hc][hd][he][if]C[Sebastian:  My idea was to make white overconcentrated on the top. The lower right quadrant of the board seemed bigger.

Jon:  You have a good idea, but I'm very worried about white's natural response of A next.  He can shut the top right corner in and try to make a big chunk of points on the top with his marked wall.

With this in mind, I'd prefer to keep the game simple and move out at A myself.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[rd];W[pj];B[oi];W[qn]LB[pl:A]
TR[pj][qj]C[Sebastian:  This was weird. Overplay?

Jon:  It looks weird at first, but saving the two marked white stones on their own would be too much of a pain, so this way white can threaten to take a simple base in the corner with the 3-3 invasion or cap the black stone with A.]
;B[ol];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq]

(;B[oj]LB[mo:A]TR[pj][qj]C[Sebastian:  Now the game seems to be fine for black. Is this move good? How about black A instead?

Jon:  I love the solidity of this move, but because white's marked stones aren't going anywhere fast, I'd prefer to go for black A.]
;W[np]C[Jon:  You can really see the difference between who gets to this area first.]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn]
(;W[mn]C[Jon:  An overplay, white must connect.];B[mp]C[Jon:  White says "Ow!"]
;W[mr];B[lp];W[nm]
(;B[pn]LB[om:A]C[Jon:  This feels submissive, black can safely block at A.]
;W[io]
(;B[ln];W[lo];B[ko];W[mm];B[kp];W[lk];B[li]C[Jon:  It's going to be a tough fight for white.]
;W[kn]
(;B[lm]C[Jon:  I'd prefer to give up this stone and try to attack from the outside.]

(;W[jl]LB[km:A]C[Jon:  White has the right idea, but I feel making the atari at A directly will leave white with a stronger group.]
;B[kl]C[Sebastian:  I think black missed this move.

Jon:  You mean white?  Probably, and it's going to make things more complicated for white.]
;W[mj];B[kk];W[mi]LB[el:A]C[Sebastian:  I think this is good enough for black.

Jon:  Looks good.  The last piece in this puzzle will be to get the turn at A.]
;B[kb]C[I played here to see how white answers. If white plays n18, black will try to split white's groups.]
;W[mb];B[ng];W[lh]
(;B[mh]LB[ki:B][kj:A]C[Sebastian:  I misread here. I did not see that white can play at A.

Jon:  Yeah, I'd want to extend at B instead.];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj]
;B[ik];W[lg]C[Sebastian:  I decided to start endgame soon.

Jon:  That's reasonable,];B[nf];W[od];B[pe];W[oe];B[pf];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[ih]LB[hb:C][jf:B][og:A][el:D]C[I think this is bigger than A. Black aims at B + C.

Jon:  Agreed.   You also want to try and get D too.];W[pg]

;B[jg];W[ke];B[jd];W[ie]
(;B[el];W[fj];B[gj];W[dk];B[fk]LB[ki:B][gk:A][hk:C]C[Jon:  To keep it simple, I'd prefer to extend straight down at A.  This way you can threaten B later, but it also weakens the bad aji white would have with the hane/wedge at C.]
;W[hk]LB[bi:A][kl:B][dq:C]C[i dont remember the subsequent moves. It became a giant tsumego. There was a very big fight, black lived at A, died at B and killed C o_O

Jon:  Wow!  XD  Killing C doesn't surprise me as much, black can really smush that thing, but living at A, sounds like the rest of the game was exciting!]

[rq:78][gr:52][hr:54][mr:88]C[Sebastian:  Any final comments on some moves?
Thanks a lot for reviewing!

Jon:  To recap, I'd like to summarize two of the more important points for this game:

1.)  In pincer joseki for the one point approach to the 3-4, a one point pincer requires one jump out, the two point pincer requires two jumps out.

2.)  When choosing a joseki, always watch for any nearby stones that may affect what you can and cannot do.  In this game, the white stones at 10 and 40 played a huge part in the bottom left.


Thank you very much for allowing me to review your game!  I hope you found it beneficial, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.]

Jon:  Extending down the side is the joseki move, but it allows black to take control of the top.]
;B[hd]C[Jon:  Black is happy to press white down.])))
(;W[dc]LB[dp:A]C[Jon:  This is why white places the top left corner on this 3-4 point.  Now white can wait and see what black does in the bottom right corner before choosing his second corner point.  Taking the diagonally opposite 4-4 point at A wouldn't be a big threat to white, due to the nature of diagonal openings.]
;B[dp]C[Jon:  Diagonal openings lead to more territorial kind of games, as separating all of the corners makes it hard to build moyo, so using two 4-4 points in such an opening isn't the greatest idea, they're not a good fit for it.]
