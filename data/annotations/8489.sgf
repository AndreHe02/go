C[astralos [8k\]: hi, gg



hi my name is Mythical , 1k on KGS, and i will try my best to help you see where you went wrong.

my comments will start with [M\].


[M\]: as you will see in the review , you have 3 big weaknesses in your play.


1.you played very slow moves -  you have to play fast and efficiant moves.
fuseki and middle game is the time to mark the teritory you want to make yours , you simple cannot play moves thats worth 1-2 points for no reason.
if you do , your oponent will take that time to play faster and bigger moves and in the end of the game he will win.

2. you didnt attacked very well  (almost didnt attacked at all)
you have to be more agressive , either take away oponents eyes and make them run , or try to cover them so that you could make outside profit while oponent tries to live.

3.you third problem is that you leave either weaknesses at your groups or  just leave weak groups.
if you have weak group your oponent will attack them , and he will make profit while doing so.
important proverb to memorise: "play urgent moves before big moves"



the key to becoming stronger is to play efficient moves which wont slow you down , to learn how to attack well and to keep your groups alive and well - if possible with good shape and speed.

good luck !];B[pd]C[farwith [7k\]: hi, enjoy];W[qp];B[dc];W[dq]
;B[co]
(;W[cp]C[[M\]: this is probably not good move by white , since it makes black stronger for no reason.]
;B[do];W[ce]C[[M\]: usually is not good to not finish joseki , especially for the kyu level.

there is reason for josekis , if oponent knows how to punish it can lead to good result for him.]
(;B[ee]
(;W[dg]C[[M\]: white was tricked.]
(;B[ck];W[qf]C[Seems white is not bothered with finishing josekis



[M\]: yes , you should try punish him for that.

is actually good strategy for go , if opponnent does not finish joseki why not play there yourself?]
;B[nd];W[fc];B[ed];W[hd]
(;B[kc];W[jc]
(;B[kd]C[[M\]: submissive move.]
(;W[rc]TR[hd][fc][jc][ce][dg]C[[M\]: leaving weak groups is not good style.]
(;B[qc]C[[M\]: slow move !

you have to be more active , if you have weak group defend , if oponent has weak group then attack !]
;W[rd]C[I would say white now has 3 weak groups. But how to attack?]
;B[gf]C[I thought by keeping them apart, not?



[M\]: yes also possible idea.

but the problem is that they have space to live , first try to take that away !

force them to run !];W[hf];B[ge];W[he];B[eg]C[[M\]: "dont touch weak group"



by touching it you make it stronger , giving it chance to live.]

(;B[bo]C[[M\]: bit slow ! play lower right corner or right side !]
;W[bp];B[iq]C[Maybe it was better to get into the white framework at p3 or r8?



[M\]: yes ! let white play slow moves , you will get more points playing faster.]

;W[pq];B[oo]C[[M\]: good idea ! play lightly here !];W[pm]
(;B[of]C[[M\]: but thats not good idea right now .

"play urgent moves before big one's"

you have group in lower right side , you need to take care of it first.]

[om][nm][nn][no][mo][po][oo][qo]C[Im aiming at getting the p11 group, or the m9 group. I can always make an eye at q6 if I need an extra libery, I thought.

[M\]: actually you cant aim for it because either way black will die first.
black group has only 3 liberties , and either way white will play there first.

making an eye at q 6 actually reduces one liberty from black , since white will need only one move to put black in atari.]
