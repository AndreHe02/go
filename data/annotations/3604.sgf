C[Chris: Hi, in this game I played black and allowed W to solidify too strongly where was just moyo before. I am not quite sure whether that is the real reason I lost, or something else.
I will prefix my questions with "Chris:".

Thx for doing this review.


Chris

*Hi, I play NukeMarine on KGS (5k) and IGS (16k*, man I need to play there more).  All my comments start with an asterisk.  It was a good game that I think black dominated but let white push him around a bit too much in midgame and yose.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]C[Chris:My favourite opening];W[dd];B[od]
;W[qk];B[fq]LB[qn:a][qh:b]C[I don't follow the Shusaku opening too much (your 4-3, 4-3 opening).  After the enclose P-16, White should approach at Q-5.  Hard to say, but 'a' encourages 'b' then you can play G-3.  You have two good corners and sente then.]
;W[cn];B[iq]TR[jp]C[Chris: Here I decided to go for some solid terretory (or as solid as it gets at this stage) and work my way into his from this point on.

*might as well play K-4 if you play the side. If you want territory, R-5 is your play.]
;W[qn]C[ Chris: Here is the first uncertainty i had. I assume it is necessary to answer, but in what way?]
;B[mp]TR[oo]C[Chris: So I just extended to some side.

*with J-3, may as well play P-5.  Not much white can do directly.]
;W[jc];B[qi];W[ok]C[Chris: I wanted to put some pressure on W but, in the end I think I forced him in the right direction.

*With a two stone base, all he can do is play out.  He can also slide into the corner to solidfy eyespace.]
;B[lc];W[je]C[Chris: Same here. In fact here I think its worse, since d16 is further away, making a nicer moyo.

*Moyo is a framework and not territory. He does have a nice setup though. C-11 looking important, followed by the corner slides D-2 and S-2]
;B[cf]
(;W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[cj]LB[ch:a]C[Chris: I was hoping to do the 3-3 here, but protected before me, getting loads of terretory.

*Heck yes.  You should thank white for C-15.  A pincer at 'a' would be an extension from C-6.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[cq]C[Chris: I felt I was slowly but steadily falling behind so I reduced here. Is this really the largest reuction play available atm?]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[cr];W[ck]
(;B[bj]MA[dj][dk]C[*D-10 or E-9.  Big threats on white.];W[bk]
;B[rp]MA[dk]C[Chris: Better get a large corner. Now I thought I am a bit ahead so, I can relax. Unfortunately I didnt see the size of L4.

*D-9 follows the proverb "Hane at the head of two without looking". White will force you to go in the center ahead of him. You'd want this.]
;W[kp]C[Chris: And it came immediately. I didnt really have a clue, how to respond best.]
;B[lq]C[*Good, attaching would make white stronger.];W[kq]
(;B[oi]MA[io]C[Chris: After this reduction, agaian, I thought I need to extend my goods. Were any of L2, D9 or H15/H16 bigger?

*H-5 attacks that heavy group of L-3. You can chase it into the R-9 group and C-6 group.]

(;B[le]MA[lo]C[*Ladder doesn't work so play M-5 to keep white seperated.  Remember, expand territory, and keep connected.]
;W[lp];B[mq];W[ln]C[*Now white is connected and has big territory.  He gained more than M-15 gained you.]
;B[pp];W[po];B[hd];W[hc]MA[dk][fn]C[Chris: here we go. I am not certain, if I am not helping him a lot here, since B is giving W a target and W gets uninvadable. I just assumed, it is the largest reduction play, and an invasion is impossiblle. Was it really?

Leave it then.  Wait till you get reinforcements from other plays on the board.

Connecting takes off immense pressure that can be aimed at your group now.  A good game overall.]
