C[Hi, my name is Benjamin Plante (BenLinus is an homage to the show 'LOST'.

I played White, my rank on kgs is 21k.

My early game was kinda crappy, but I ended up winning so I was hoping a review would help me understand what he and I did right, and what he and I did wrong. If possible I'd like comments on both me and my opponent, as I believe I can learn just as much from my moves as his.

I know this game could be considered a slaughter, which is a "DON'T", but the issue is I'm not exactly sure how that came to be. I hope this is okay to submit.

Thank you in advance. I will mark all my comments with the label Ben, to distinguish between myself and the reviewer.

~Ben

Hi,

I'm Damien, 5k OGS, French 9k.
I'll be reviewing your games. I'll begin all my comments with 'dmg:'. I hope my review will help you.

-- Damien];B[fd]C[Ben: His opening move is not one that I tend to use. 3-3 or tengen are my prefered for 9x9 boards, but perhaps I'm wrong.

dmg: This seems ok. I find san-san on 9x9 boards a little to protective. I really enjoy tengen as a first move :)]
;W[df]C[Ben: Thinking maybe 4-4 has it's advantages, I tried it as well. I would certainly never experiment like that in a more important and/or ranked game.

dmg: Most 9x9 games ends up being a fight It's ok to answer a 4-4 with another 4-4. You could have considered a basic 3-4 also. Sometimes, I do a san-san invasion when black is playing a 4-4 on a 9x9 since the corner is so big and you can end sente.
On testing stuff, I strongly advice you to do it on more important games to force you to think on new things.]
;B[ef]C[Ben: Seems he wanted to attack quickly.

dmg: Black move might be a little agressive but the komi is 6.5 on 9x9 so black needs to be aggressive. Attack is the main strenght required on 9x9.]
;W[ee]C[Ben: So I respond.

dmg: What if black cuts here? White could have just extended or hane at E3. Or even tenuki and goes for san-san.]
;B[fe]C[dmg: this is passive but still good for black.];W[ff]
C[dmg: I don't think this move is ok. See variation on move 9]
;B[eg];W[fg]
(;B[dg]C[Ben: A mistake?

dmg: Well I would have played in a different order because here white can connect on D5. See variation.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ed];B[dd];W[ec];B[dc]C[dmg: Black should go and capture C4 by playing C3 here.]
;W[fc]
(;B[gd]C[Ben: He acknowledges his mistake in the variation he made.

dmg: Indeed, this is bad shape too (empty triangle).];W[gc]
;B[gf]C[dmg: More bad shape. White atari at H6. See variation.]

(;W[fh]C[Ben: Trying to force him to E2.

dmg: I think it's aji-keshi. You should captures the G6 stones.]
;B[eh]C[dmg: Bad shape for black. White can capture E2 by playing C3 now.]
;W[cg];B[ei]
(;W[dh]C[dmg: no. See variation.];B[di]C[Ben: Would C2 have been better for him?
dmg: Sure, black is helping you there.];W[ch]C[Ben: E1 is dead.

dmg: Indeed.];B[fi]
(;W[gi]C[dmg: I think H6 would have killed the lot. However. G1 is safer. Probably better at G2 (removing eyespace for the other group).]
;B[gh]C[Ben: Futile
dmg: not for helping the other group. But I don't think that works.]
;W[ci];B[gg];W[hh];B[hg];W[hi]C[dmg: futile. You're losing a move here. H6.]

(;B[hc]C[Ben: G5 was key, yes?

dmg: No. if G5, white plays H6. If there's a key move it's H6. I don't thinks it's work actually (see var).
However in this state of the game black can resign.];W[hd];B[id]
C[Ben: G5 key again.];W[ge];B[he];W[gd];B[if];W[hb];B[cb];W[db]
C[dmg: mistake here.];B[da]C[dmg: And black just help you again. Black should have moved at E8 here.]
;W[eb];B[bc]
(;W[ea]C[dmg: What about C6? I think it kills here.]
(;B[ca]C[dmg: Black C9 is wrong. It doesn't give more eyes space. See variation.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[be]C[dmg: C6 kills.];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae]
;B[ba]C[dmg: it's useless here. blacks already alive.];W[bg]
C[Ben: B3 was a waste on my part, that group is very much alive. Oops.

dmg: Indeed.];B[ib];W[ic]C[dmg: why playing a ko? Just connect at G8.]
;B[ha];W[ia]C[dmg: Same here.];B[tt];W[tt]TB[aa][ab][bb][cc]
TW[af][ag][ah][ai][bf][bh][bi][dg][di][ef][eg][eh][ei][fa][fb]
[fd][fe][fi][ga][gb][gf][gg][gh][ha][hc][he][hf][hg][ib][id]
[ie][if][ig][ih][ii]C[asyam [?\]: thx
BenLinus [21k\]: thx

Ben: And that's that.

dmg: Yeah the games was a slaughter. But as soon as black loose the E4 stones, he should have resigned. Actually the game should have been a victory for white by 87.5 (no stones alive for black).
You should probably do some tsumegos and black should too as well as studying some basic shape.
Try to think of cross-cut that's leads to hard time for both player if a passive answer is just to easy on the opponent.

I hope my review will help you. Please feel free to contact by email if you have any question.]
