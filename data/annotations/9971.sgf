C[H: Dear Reviewer, I have written a few questions into the SGF; in addition to them, I'd love to get any feedback you have on where I could improve.

TM: Hello, my name is Tomáš. I will prefix my comments with TM.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[nq]C[H: Funny side to approach from; was my reaction good?

TM: This approach is uncommon; your reaction is good.];B[po]
;W[jc];B[de];W[cd];B[ce]TR[ed]C[TM: This move is somewhat passive, I would try the marked move here.]
;W[dj]C[H: Again something I have not seen before. I decided to form some base and attack from there. Was my reaction OK?

TM: This move does not have a clear purpose. It does not attack black, as it leaves plenty of room for a base. It is not the best extention either.]
;B[dh]TR[ch]C[TM: This is OK. But since you are trying to build a base, you might want to play the marked move instead. That would form a more solid base and at the same time threaten to slide under the white stone and undermine his influence.]
;W[bg]TR[ci][be]C[H: Here I decided to not react to this; should I have played c11 here?

TM: This is one of the reason to play the lower stone. As for the continuation, C11 seems OK, but I would also consider B15, to attack the stone and threaten the corner at the same time.]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[fi];W[jp]C[H: He leaves my top left group alone, so I build my framework. Was y move the best one?]
;B[pj]C[TM: This is somewhat passive again. I would suggest doing something about the left-down part of the board.]
;W[qk]C[H: Here I felt that this is too deep in. Could I have killed that stone, or was the running battle I decided to do the better solution?

TM: This stone is likely to survive. Running it out and getting territory in the process is the right idea here.]
;B[qj];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro]TR[rj]C[H: Wrong side! He should have played s10 first, true?

TM: I agree.];B[rp];W[rn];B[rk];W[rl];B[rj];W[pl]C[H: Ad now I wanted to play o5, but first a preparing move ...]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[no];W[nl];B[nj];W[nm];B[or]TR[mq][lq][lp][ln]
[lc][fq][cq][cn][be]C[TM: This seems really slow. I would prefer any of the marked points over this.]
;W[nr];B[lp];W[lq];B[lo];W[lm]C[H: Now the white stones get closer to the left, so I decided to do something for my top left group, but would L10 have been a better move?

TM: That is hard to say. Both seem OK to me.];B[ch];W[be];B[cj]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[ej];W[bi]C[H: This is a "thank you" move :)

TM: It would be...];B[ci]TR[fq][kn][lk][lj][cq][lc][kq]C[TM: ... but this is also very slow. You do not really need it and are much bigger points on the board.]
;W[bj];B[fk]C[TM: So slow!];W[dl];B[ek];W[lk];B[lc]TR[li]C[H: Here I considered M17 to be bigger than M11, is that so?

TM: I think that  M17 is better here. It creates solid points on the top and threatens to build a big framework. M11 expantion seems to be reduced much easily.]
;W[hl]C[TM: Greedy, leaves F7 open.];B[ij]TR[fm][cq][fq][kq]
[kn]C[TM: This does not really do anything. You need to reduce white right now. I would play the corner invasion and then try to get F7, if white does not get it first.]
;W[kn];B[li]C[H: He is nice to me and lets me play M11 too.

TM: Yes, but your framework is easier to reduce than his. The gap between M17 and M11 is huge.]
;W[op];B[oo];W[sp]C[TM: Too slow.];B[rq];W[rr];B[sq];W[so];B[qr]
;W[ps];B[os];W[ns];B[oq];W[np];B[pp];W[je];B[le];W[ki];B[lj]
;W[kj];B[kh];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[lh];W[ig];B[gg];W[hd];B[he]
;W[ie];B[gf]TR[hf][ff]C[H: Here I thought about h14; would that have been better? I was afraid of wF14 next.

TM: H14 is OK, you do not have to worry about F14.];W[fm]C[H: Boundary closed, time for a 3-3 invasion, true?

TM: Time for 3-3 invasion was long ago, but sure, better late than never.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[bq]C[H: This I never saw before. Did I react well, or did he just react badly to my reaction?

TM: Neither of you played the optimal variation. See a joseki book for a detailed explanation. Here you should play B2 first.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[dr]C[TM: Again, B2.];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[ir];B[hr];W[iq];B[br];W[aq];B[is];W[js];B[hs];W[kr];B[hp]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[io];B[jo];W[jq];B[ko];W[jn];B[mn];W[kp];B[ar]
;W[bp];B[kb];W[jb];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[hb];B[ke];W[qh]C[H: Can this invasion work?

TM: This invasion is unlikely to work now. Although I would not be surprised if there was a variation involving a ko for the corner.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[rf];W[ne];B[oe];W[of];B[pe];W[pf];B[oh];W[oi]
;B[oj];W[nh];B[pi];W[ni];B[ph];W[og];B[mj];W[mk];B[hf]C[H: Here white thought for a long time, so I took the time to do a quick count of territory and saw a 24-moku advantage for black. I may have counted pessimistically, but decided to just play very solidly from here on.]
;W[ik];B[gj];W[kg];B[lg];W[lf];B[kf]C[H: Was this a OK reaction? I try one variation for white ...

TM: This is the right move.]
(;W[jg];B[mf];W[jf];B[kc];W[hh];B[gh];W[hi];B[hj];W[el];B[gl]
;W[gm];B[hk];W[im];B[jk];W[il];B[jj];W[jl]C[H: Wow, he lets me cut at L9! This kills H16, which I immediately saw at this point. Could I have done something worse to him?

TM: I do not see anything bigger at this point.];B[kk];W[kl]
;B[id];W[jd];B[hc];W[ic];B[hd];W[gb];B[ed];W[ec];B[dd];W[bc]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[cf];W[bf];B[sl];W[sm];B[sk];W[pk];B[mm];W[ml]
;B[nn];W[ln];B[fr]C[H: Needed to drop some adrenaline here. I guess this move was completely unnecessary, wasn't it?

TM: It was. But since you are in the lead, better save than sorry.]

[rs][ss]C[H: I won with 38.5 moku; did I count so badly at move 155, or did I secure so many more points in the end game?

TM: GnuGo says B+31 at move 155. I would say B+44 (as a very rough estimate). So B+39 seems about right.

Thanks for sending your game.

Best wishes,
Tomáš])
