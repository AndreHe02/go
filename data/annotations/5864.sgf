C[-- Hello, my name is Sven and I´m about 9 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 13 kyu at KGS.
My comments are all preceded by "--" and I hope they will provide a little bit of help to you.

Your game was decided by the first 33 moves. Here White made a few major mistakes in the fuseki (opening game), which left him with two weak groups floating in the center. White played on the fifth line and invited Black to make a base for his stones beneath. Remember that the third line is for claiming territory, while the forth line aims at building influence.

[cf:C][cn:A][fo:1][ko:2]C[-- but Black foils him!

-- Let´s take a little rest...  So far, Black has excellent influence on the whole left side of the board, while White has claimed a narrow stripe of territory at the right (Indeed, CGoban´s estimation gives a 90 point victory for Black).
Since there are two weak white groups (1 and 2) to care for, Black probably will be able to dominate the further play by chasing his opponent around. If White still has a chance to win the game, it is by reducing or invading Blacks territory.

-- so White should play at points like A, B, C or D next. (and give up group number 2, which will be too expensive to save)]
