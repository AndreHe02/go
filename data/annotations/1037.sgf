C[Hi,
Thanks for reviewing this game.  I played white.  Although I won by resignation of my opponent, I was noticeably lagging and I believe I won only due to my opponents's misread.  I didn't deserve this game  :)
Hope you don't mind the large number of questions I've included regarding this game.  I would especially like advice regarding:
a) fuseki -- I'm very weak
b) joseki -- need to build up my strength, especially when to diverge from joseki and how to punish my opponent's failure to follow it.
My fighting/reading skills are okay though I lack a strong sense of when & when not to tenuki

Thanks again!];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[dd];B[do]LB[eo:A][fp:B]C[Well, now playing at A causes trouble for each side very early. (as in the game)
My favorite move here would be at B, and the sequence in the branch is a
possible follow up.]
(;W[eo]C[Is this the right move for such a fuseki?

as I said, it causes trouble very early and as you do not know the
josekis that may come up, either side has to fear, that something
nasty may happen to their groups. If you like to araise trouble in
this early stage of the game, it is ok.];B[dn]LB[dp:A]C[Not joseki!  How to punish?
Immediately the cut at e4 starts bothering me, since the ladder is in black's favour.

well, the fact, that this move is not listed in joseki books does not mean that it is
that bad that black looses the game by it.
Nor does it mean that you can punish black for it immediately.
A good follow up for white would by at A, and black gets less then he would
have got in other josekis, so this sequence is good for white.]

(;W[gp]C[d4 better?

much better (see above)
This move neither protects the cut nor takes territory or influence.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dp]LB[cp:A][dr:B]C[this move is not good, as you push into a hane at the head of 2 stones (after black plays A)
in this situation is is hard to find a good move. I think best you can get here is at B.]
;B[cp];W[oq]LB[en:A]C[You should once push at A, as this is almost sente and you can stabilize  your group there.
After that P3 is ok];B[op];W[np];B[oo]
(;W[jp]C[I now realize that white is *much* better off after the joseki q3-r3 exchange.   Yes, definitelly]
;B[pq]C[Now black has a large lower right corner with much potential along the
right egde.];W[dj]LB[nq:A][pj:B]C[Which is more important here -- d10 or r10?  It seems like I'm already behind territory-wise, and w r10 only helps black widen that gap.  But letting black take r10 gives him a *huge* right corner later in the game.

Well, you are right, you are far behind in territory as well as in influence.
Black now allready got two large corners and white just got something
on the lower egde, that is not very solid.
The game is now very hard for white.

Maybe just connecting at A is good here to get rid of at least on problem.
But looking at the right side a move at B would at least separate the
two black groups at that edge and avoid a framework there.
After your move the sequence in the thread could come, and then there
is another problem with D10.]
(;B[ck];W[cj];B[pj];W[qf]C[Must invade!  Is r10/r8 a better invasion spot?  Also, after the pincer is there any way to avoid ending up in gote?

It is hard to do something against the lower right black formation, as it is very, very solid.
This move seems ok, but if black plays better here, it does not help much (see branch)
Black gets territory as well as sente in that sequence and white just gets a weak formation
(additional to the other ones he has)]
(;B[qh]LB[qe:A]C[Wrong direction, as W R14 is pincered allready.
Black will get some stones on that side if he starts at A
and keeps white away from getting a base for his group  on the right side.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[ld];W[rd];B[rg]LB[qc:A]C[Better at A.
Takes territory while avoiding a base for white.];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qe]LB[qb:A]C[W at A better here, as it takes the corner making a base and
still looking into blacks area.];B[nq]C[Now back to whites problems ...]
;W[mq];B[nr]LB[or:A][mr:B]C[Must be at A, as now B is sente for W]
;W[mp]C[N2 is Sente and should be played first];B[mr]LB[lr:A]
C[A much better here.
White cannot cut of this and black takes away more of the white territory.]
;W[lr]LB[fc:A];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[fc]C[Which is optimal choice of joseki here?  I chose to pincer, mainly because I'm worried about black getting a big swath of territory along upper side.

if you choose to pincer, after F15 your pincer stone will be in trouble.
I think the sequence in the branch is ok for white.
But still the game is very difficult for white.]
(;W[hc];B[ic]LB[fe:A]C[Not good, as it weekens F17
Playing at A would help black to attack H17 or reduce whites moyo
on the left side.];W[hd];B[cc]C[This move surprised me, I was expecting f15.  Being able to enclose black in the corner and getting outside influence worked out better for me (or did it??)

well, it is ok in blacks situaltion, as it avoids trouble.
F15 is ok as well, but not neccessary in this situation.];W[cd]
;B[dc]
(;W[fd]LB[ed:A]C[Must be at A.
If black plays A (as he did) white is the one with the cuts and problems.
The sequence from the branch is much better for white.];B[ed]
;W[ee];B[ec];W[fe];B[bd];W[cf]C[Silly mistake, simply b15 is fine.

B15 is better, thats right.];B[be];W[bf];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk]C[Taking stock -- now I'm definitely way behind in territory.  But I'm beginning to see the seeds of a big central moyo.  So I move to expand it.
In the course of strengthening the moyo, I also give black a chance to solidify his upper middle & lower left territories.  Was there any way to avert this, or was it a correct decision?

Well, it is very hard to transform this moyo into territory, but maybe thats white's last chance.
There are too many ways for black to recude the moyo, so only few (about 20-30) can be  achived there. Much to few for white to win.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[id];B[jc];W[jd];B[kc]LB[kd:A]C[A better here, looking into white's moyo even more.]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[el];B[dm];W[em]LB[mj:A][ml:B][mn:C]C[Black should see at least now white's moyo and do something against it.
Moves at A,B or C wold be much better.];B[en];W[fn]C[Ouch -- so many cut points, but that's okay.

Well, white can give some stones there, thats no problem.];B[ek]
C[wrong direction again
from the right egde a reduction would be much better and as well
enlarge blacks moyo there.
The use of this move is quite doubtful.
Black here looks for trouble which is not neccessary.];W[fl]
;B[fk];W[gl]C[i considered f5 here but felt this was stronger.

definitely better, as it strengthens the middle (the only area you can
enlarge your amount out territory now)];B[gk];W[hk];B[fo]C[black first strengthens white in the center and then hunts for
some single stones.
If he wants to catch stones, then he should better do before
he makes gifts.
But still moves from the right side are much better];W[gn];B[fi]
LB[hl:A]C[again he first stengthened white and then runs against a much stronger wall.
Very doubtful.
now the only weak point at A that white had, has vanished and there is only  little hope for black to keep his stones (btw. there are of no use, so loosing
then is now bad. But the more black looses, the worse things become)]
;W[hj];B[eh]LB[mm:A]C[I should have tenuki here, but lacked the guts  :)

Yes, something around A would have been much better
the game would be quite even after that.];W[dh];B[di];W[ci]
;B[mn]C[Please comment on my next 3-4 moves.  The way I saw it:  black has great strength to run to on the right.  Also, if he can penetrate my moyo then the game is effectively over for me.  So I treat the invading stones with a lot of respect (too much?) and permit black to build his own, huge territory on right.
What is the best course of action?

This is a very good move for black as it enlarges the black moyo as well as it  makes white's moyo smaller.
As black is very strong at the right side, there is no really good move for
white now and the game should be won for black after it.];W[km]
;B[mj]C[Anything, black plays there, helps him and hurts white.

Well, the game is won for black here allready.
He is ahead here about 30 points, so only silly mistakes
can help white to win. (Unfortunately he did some :-

The best move for white here is simply resigning.

Comments on the rest of the game would not help getting better for any
side, as black now just has to avoid very large errors.
And that is only learned by doing.

The mistakes that decided the game were earlier in the game and I hope,
My comments will help to avoid them in future.];W[kj];B[lh]
