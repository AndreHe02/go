;W[ib];B[hc]C[MR: Strange shape. If H18 does not work in your opinion, J17 is strange to begin with. But why not H18?]

(;W[em];B[jp];W[lq];B[jq];W[oq];B[cf]LB[io:A]TR[oq]C[Given white's reinforcement of his lower right with the marked stone, I wonder if black should a move around A to defend.  If white's H4 stone escapes, black stones at k3 could be a liability and black's lower left territoriy will be reduced significantly

MR: Currently, the bottom edge is neither black nor white territory. If you invest another move at A, you must be pretty sure that you will catch the white stone at H4 by that. My feeling is that the right edge is bigger, as white would love to play R10.]

MR: Yes, M5 is too heavy.];W[qm];B[bj]TR[eb]C[Now I look back, I am not sure if this is proper.  It is on the second line, and the marked white stone could cause trouble in the upper left.  Shouldn't black make a more solid move, rather than the thin play in the game?

MR: In my opinion, the move is quite ok. White would also like to play at C12, making territory on the left and making the marked stone even more vitalized.]

;B[hf];W[ge];B[he]LB[hg:A]C[Wouldn't A be better to protect the cut?

MR: My idea would be not to defend every single stone but just to make a living group locally or escape. I feel that H15 and H13 are too heavy and would prefer something like L13. 
In what follows, there are a couple of moves I would not have played. However, your main idea should be to escape with most of your stones.]

MR: It is ok that you are afraid of the cut at A, but in my opinion the white continuation is S18, black S14, white S18.]

MR: I think that the white splitting attack on blacks small and heavy groups was the decisive point of the game.  You made some strange and docile moves in  the beginning when white tried to settle the group in the upper right, but then somehow recovered in the moves up to R9. However, living and fighting with small groups seems not to be one of your main strengths, so maybe this would be an area where you could concentrate on for improvement.]
