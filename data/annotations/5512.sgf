Hello, dear reviewer!

I look foreward to receive the reviewed game,
Thank you in advance!];B[oc]C[[Malweth\] - It is an uncommon way to start, but definitely possible. The fuseki will not be as easy this way.]
;W[qd]C[[Malweth\] - It is odd for W to want territory so early with this approach.

It is certainly possible in the opening. The fight in fuseki will be for W and B to make good use of their UR stones.]
;B[pd]LB[pe:A]C[[Malweth\] - The best way to punish it would be to play the other corners in a way that makes it a bad approach.

Generally attaching is bad. The normal move is at "a," but this should be saved for later. Play at the other corners first. It is generally best to balance the corners in terms of placement (in an empty corner), enclosure (with two stones), and approach (an enemy corner). This move does not place, enclose, or approach a corner.]
;W[qe]C[[Malweth\] - It is good for W to move to the outside, though R17 can be an option.

In this case, W wants to play outside because there's lots of potential there on the empty board.]
;B[qc]C[[Malweth\] - It's not good to memorize joseki, and definitely not good to ignore the rest of the board to play it. It's best to ignore joseki whenever possible! In this case, W could play S17 to force R18 and then play elsewhere. The pincer would be possible for B, but with an open board there is a lot that can happen!

---

for this sequence, I'm  prepared to; that is the reason, I could not wait to play the other corners first.]
;W[dc]
(;B[pe]C[[Malweth\] - This should be at R13 or tenuki!

See variation.];W[qf]
(;B[dp]C[[Malweth\] - It seems ok to me. The LR corner is less interesting and this is a high move that hopes to play C15 later. In this regard, you could again play the 5-3 at C5 and more strongly attack the UL. See variation.

---

I'm not sure, wether this move is the right direction];W[qp]

(;B[pj]C[[Malweth\] - Because W played at R4, pincering the three low white stones isn't very interesting. The low stones are not efficient if W can play at P3 and Q10. 

The two approaches are both very big, but I would prefer the one in the upper left (due to the inefficient white stones on the right side.]
;W[qi]C[[Malweth\] - This is why Q10 was best at Q12.

It was probably best for W to play at R12 now... there's no reason to attach to B like this.]
;B[qj];W[pi]
(;B[qn]LB[pp:A]C[[Malweth\] - No! It is almost always bad to attach to a single enemy stone where you have some power! R6 isn't the best move, though... 
The White and  Black stones are moving from the right side toward the center. This should be continued, especially since W blocked at R11 (putting you ahead in walking). See Kageyama's "Fundamentals of Go"

See variation.

is B9 at 'A' better? see variation];W[nq];B[oo];W[op]
(;B[jc]C[[Malweth\] - Corner approaches are almost always bigger. You have little hope for big moyo here because of the white group on the top right-side.

Try C15 instead and force W to play toward your thickness. Then you can expand the left side as in the variation.]
;W[cf];B[cj];W[fq];B[hq]C[[Malweth\] - This is trying to take all the territory away from white. The bottom side is not interesting for black, all white stones are low.

Develop a solid position first, and then invade and attack.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[gp]
(;B[kq]C[[Malweth\] - A better choice might be J5.];W[dr];B[cq]

;W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh];W[qg];B[qh];W[rh]
(;B[nf]LB[rj:A]C[[Malweth\] - Yes. O14 probably wasn't the best either. Try N13.

(;B[hd]C[[Malweth\] - You're right, this doesn't make best use of your influence.

Unfortunately, K17 is a bit far from G17 (and too close to the wall, making you over concentrated). Otherwise something like F18 might work well.

In this case, you probably need to be content with forcing W around F16, E16, D16, etc. Starting with the probe at D18 might be useful.]
;W[gd];B[he];W[hc];B[ic];W[ge];B[hf];W[gg];B[ef]C[[Malweth\] - Now this seems too late!]
;W[eh];B[gf];W[ff]TR[hf][he]SQ[hd]MA[oc][nh][mh][mg][nf][of]
[pe][pd][qc][qb]C[[Malweth\] - true. see variations.

To build up the triangeled wall opposite of the crossmarked powerwall was not the best thing, because they lose their appointment for an fight later on.
