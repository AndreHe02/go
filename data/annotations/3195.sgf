;B[qe];W[pd];B[qc]C[Is this joseki?

RGW: I doubt it.  However, W's move (Q16) was not joseki so I'm sort of lost here.  The 5-3 move (R15) is played in the corner for influence instead of territory so I don't think jumping into the 3-3 point makes sense unless you are planning on sacrificing it.]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[rc]C[Which way? B took the corner

RGW: As I said, the 5-3 move is not a territory move so to settle for territory in the corner seems couner to the first move.]
;B[rb];W[re];B[sc];W[qf]C[RGW: Given this outcome, B probably wants a ladder break move already in the lower left corner before starting this fight.]
;B[ob];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[dj];B[pj];W[jd];B[od];W[pe]
;B[pc]C[Solid but gote

RGW: Exactly.  The move at P16 was a forcing move, but it's worthless if B ends up in gote.  Playing somewhere on the bottom is much more important to keep W from playing around K4.]
;W[jp]C[W is taking lots of points. Now b has to invade.

RGW: Yes, B has played too slowly and now W has influence on more than half the board.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd]C[RGW: Because of the W stone at K16, B will have trouble getting much territory here (assuming B lives).  Jumping into C17 instead might be better.]
;W[ec];B[fe];W[ed];B[gc];W[ge]C[How to respond?

RGW: B is too weak inside W influence to fight on both sides so B probably needs to play H15 to save the 3 stones and threaten the W stone at K16.]
;B[ff];W[he];B[jb];W[df];B[dg];W[ef]
(;B[cf]C[RGW: See alternative moves.];W[ce];B[bf];W[eg];B[dh]
;W[eh];B[bd]C[RGW: This is unlikely to give B another eye so D11, W E11, B C10 might be better.  Unfortunately, that gives W a lot of potential for territory in the center.]
;W[be];B[ae];W[bc];B[di];W[ei]
(;B[bi]C[RGW: I think B can play C10 and get slightly better shape.  (See variation.)]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck];W[bl];B[ci];W[ej]C[This seems like a bad result for b. The left side is not alive. F15 stones aren't doing much. Upper side looks shaky too. W is thick. Where did b go wrong?

RGW: Assuming B can live on the left and top (which I think is possible, but could be tricky), this may be about the best B could hope for.  B went wrong early on by letting W get so much influence on the left half of the board.  Unfortunately, W is going to get territory in the center or in the lower left (or both) and B still has to worry about living on the left and top.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[dn];W[dm]
(;B[cq]C[Maybe f3 instead?

RGW: Interesting idea.  Could work.  (See variation.)];W[dq]
C[I was afraid of w c4. That would have been harder.

RGW: Possibly, but W may do better this way.];B[cp];W[en];B[eo]
;W[do];B[co];W[em]C[RGW: I think W needed to play F5.];B[dr]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fq]C[W thicker and thicker.];B[jj]C[I felt i should do something to erase w's wall and use my isolated stones. Maybe this was too close to the wall though.

RGW: This looks like a good spot to me.  If W had played here, it would be very difficult for B.]
;W[cd]C[Can I make life?

RGW: I think so.  See variation on the next move.]
(;B[gg]SQ[ge][he][jd]C[RGW: This threatens the marked W stones.  However, since B is weak on the top and weak with these three stones, W should be able to live or connect to the stones on the right.]
;W[ii];B[ig];W[ke];B[oe];W[kg];B[pf]C[Since w ignored the last move b goes after his right side stones. Maybe b should fight in the center instead.

RGW: Even if B doesn't kill these stones, this move is probably worthwhile for the possible fight in the center.]
;W[kb]
(;B[kc]C[RGW: I think B can live here (see variations), but there are a lot of variations so I could be wrong.]
;W[jc];B[lb];W[ib];B[ka];W[hc]C[I have given up a lot but maybe I had to.

RGW: I'm not sure you had to, but at least you get sente.];B[jh]
;W[qj]C[Unsure what next.];B[qi]C[RGW: Separating the W stones seems reasonable, but with the weak B stones in the center, a fight here could end up harming the center stones.]
;W[pk];B[ri]C[RGW: To help the stones in the center, Q11 would be a safer move.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[ji]SQ[oj][pk][qj]C[The next few moves confused me. What is b's goal?

RGW: B could consider giving up the stones in the center, if he can capture the marked W stones.  However, that is unlkely (W can live or escape) so pulling out the stones in the center is probably the best bet.]
;B[kh]C[RGW: Yes, I think this is best.];W[ki];B[li];W[kj];B[lj]
C[RGW: B should probably play M13 first.];W[kk];B[lk];W[lh]

C[Now I feel I have gotten the worst of the fighting in the center, though I have the right side in compensation. How can I reduce w's center? Or should I firm up the right side with p8, or save my left side stones?

RGW: It's too late to do much about the center so saving the stones on the left side is probably the biggest move.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[gr];W[fr];B[fs];W[gq];B[hr];W[hq];B[iq];W[ip]
;B[jq];W[kq]C[Can b go further without weakening the right side? I would like to use E5 somehow.

RGW: E5 doesn't have much potential since you need to play F5 to keep it from getting captured. When B plays F5, W can play H4 and there's not much B can do.  The left side can still be saved.]

On the other hand, B did well living in the lower left corner and capturing the W group in the upper right.]
