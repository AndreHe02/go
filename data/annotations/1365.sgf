;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[pk]TR[cn][fq][ce][de][fd]SQ[pq]C[This is similar to the Chinese opening.  If Black had placed
the lower right stone at the square, then the formation on the
right side would be a classic Chinese opening.  Most kyu players
don't understand how to take advantage of the Chinese opening,
so if you plan to use it you should specifically study it.

Some other good moves are marked with triangles.];W[ce];B[jc]
SQ[cn][fq]C[This is not Black's best choice.  White has just strengthened
the upper left corner, so Black should focus on the weaker lower
left corner.  An approach move at one of the squares is better.
I personally would play at F3 and hope White would extend up
the left side while I extended along the bottom.];W[qf]TR[qi]
SQ[qc]MA[of]C[  When White invades like this, Black should not expect to kill.
White has too many options this early in the game.
  Specifically, White can invade the corner at the square.  The
original invading stone might be sacrificed, but White should
be able to live in the corner.
  White can also make a base along the side by extending to the
triangle.  This should provide enough space to make two eyes.
  Finally, white can run out into the middle at the X.  This
last option is the most common choice.
  Black needs to decide which of these he does NOT want white
to do and block that spot by playing at or near it.  This will
still leave white with two other choices, however.];B[qe]SQ[qd]
C[Black blocks the corner to keep white from invading.  Playing
at the square is more secure for Black, however.  With the current
arrangement, White could still invade at the 3x3 point and expect
to live.];W[of]C[White chooses to run out into the middle.]
;B[pf]TR[qh]SQ[nd]C[This is bad.  Black seems to be trying to cut off and kill White.
This probably won't work and White will end up with a strong,
live group here.  Instead, Black should harass the White group
from the edges and build territory as White works to save these
stones.
  I think the best move is at the square, since it forces White
to keep extending while making Black territory on the top right.
  The triangle is also good since it keeps White from making
a base on the side.  White will probably respond by invading
around the square if Black plays at the triangle.];W[pg];B[pe]
TR[qe][pe][pd]SQ[qg][oe]C[The three marked Black stones make an empty triangle.  This is
a bad shape because it is an inefficient use of stones.  If you
find yourself tempted to make an empty triangle, stop and reconsider.
About the only time an empty triangle is good is when you need
to make eyes to make life for a group.
  The spots marked with squares are reasonable responses for
Black that don't make empty triangles.];W[rf];B[re];W[qh];B[oi]
TR[nd][me][ne]SQ[rj][qj]C[This stone doesn't attack White very well.  Black should still
either block the side with a play at one of the squares or press
from above around the triangles.  If Black really wants to attack
from this direction, then playing one space up at P12 is better
since it threatens to cut white apart.];W[oh];B[ni]SQ[qj][qi]
C[This is the wrong direction.  Black should play closer to the
side to keep white from making a large base here.  The squares
are good choices.];W[qj];B[pj]SQ[qk]C[Again, Black should block along the side at the square.  At this
rate White will get most of the side.];W[pi];B[nk]SQ[nk][pk]
[pj][oi][ni]C[The marked stones make good shape for Black.  In general, moves
that make good shape are usually good choices.  This shape is
good because it can easily make an eye for life.  Since Black
is in no danger of dying here, this eye potential is less useful,
however.  Black should still block along the side instead is
this particular case.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn]C[Black finally manages to contain White, but only after a huge
invasion.];W[sk];B[ng]SQ[fq][cn][ck]C[Black has just lost a lot of territory on the side.  This loss
needs to be made up somewhere else on the board.  This move should
be used to invade White, hopefully on an equal scale to White's
recent invasion.  The squares are all good choices.

The move Black played here is a small, endgame type Peep.];W[og]
;B[ne]C[This move is worth more than the last Black move, but it still
is not worth nearly as much as one of the invasions noted last
move.];W[cm];B[cj]SQ[cm]C[Black has waited one move too long to invade.  Now there is much
less room to make a base on the side.  Black will surely have
to run out into the middle.  The invasion is still a reasonable
idea.  It just won't accomplish as much now as it would have
before White played the marked stone.];W[ch];B[bh]SQ[ej]C[Black doesn't have enough room to make a base here.  Running
out into the center is best.];W[bg]
(;B[ci]SQ[bi]C[Playing at the square is better for Black.  See the variation
for a possible sequence for Black to live on the side.];W[bi]
;B[bj];W[ah];B[cl];W[dm];B[dl];W[fm];B[fl];W[hm];B[fj]C[This move helps secure some space for eyes.]
;W[dh];B[di];W[fh];B[fi]SQ[nq][fc][cq][iq]C[  Black's group is fairly secure here now.  Black should leave
it and play elsewhere.  There are still some very big moves to
be made.
  All of the squares are worth a lot.];W[gh];B[eh]C[This is a Gote move and worth only one point at best.  Save it
for late in the endgame.];W[eg];B[ei];W[ff];B[hj]C[  Black is still ignoring the biggest moves on the board.
  Beginning players often follow the "one inch rule".  This "rule"
says you must play within one inch of your opponent's last play.
It is not a valid rule, however.
  Look at the whole board and decide which moves are worth the
most points.  Play those spots even if they are far away from
your  opponent's last move];W[gc];B[hh]C[Now White has played one of the big moves I noted earlier and
Black responds with another small move.  Once the group is alive,
you can ignore it and move on.];W[hg];B[ig];W[hf];B[if]SQ[lk]
[kk][jk][hi][ih][nh][nf]C[  Black seems to be trying to make territory in the middle between
his two walls.  Center territory is always smaller than it seems.
It is also very easy to invade and reduce.  Black has a lot of
weaknesses for White to exploit.  A White play on any of the
squares would help reduce Black's territory.
  As an exercise, set up an empty Go board with Black stones
in a huge square on the third line and White stones in a smaller
square just inside on the fourth line.  Who looks like they have
the most territory?  To most people, the White center looks larger.
Now count the territory and you will see that the center territory
is not as big as it seems.
  Never focus on center territory until all of the corners and
sides are secure.  The lower side is still up for grabs and both
lower corners could be invaded.];W[ih];B[ii];W[hi];B[gi];W[ij]

the Black stone is out of Atari.];W[jm];B[km];W[jn];B[kn];W[jp]

play at one of the squares.];B[em]C[Gote endgame move.];W[en]
;B[el];W[gn];B[jl]C[Black is still trying to secure the huge stripe of territory
down the center while allowing White have the lower side.  This
is not a wise exchange.];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[nq];W[np];B[mo]

of connecting to Black's left side group makes this invasion
more workable than it would be otherwise.  See the variation.]

(;B[ib]TR[jb]SQ[hb]C[Normally, this is a Gote move for Black.  White would play at
the square and Black would connect at the triangle.  If Black
plays at the triangle instead, white has to respond.  This makes
the move Sente for Black.  See the variation for White's loss
if he fails to respond.];W[jh];B[kh];W[hb];B[ia];W[ha];B[bm]

weaknesses Black should go back and fix before playing here.
The squares are all worth more to Black by helping secure the
center.];W[jb];B[kb];W[ja];B[ka];W[nh]SQ[mi][oe]C[Now White starts to take advantage of the weaknesses in Black's
walls.  Black can't possibly block all of White's encroachments.
Black should play at one of the squares to minimize his losses.]

much of the sides and corners.])

ahead here.]))
