C[review was requested by Gabriel <gabriel@tuthk.com>.

I am 3k with black and playing with a 2K with white.

* I - Tommie, 3d EUR - will indicate my comments by an asterix.
Usually I focus what I think I can do better - 
local shape and global direction (I hope I get that right).

Any idea within the fundamentals of Go is fine.
If the fundamentals are hurt, then sharp criticism is necessary.

I will refer to white as she/her/herself etc.

As an extra, I added several diagrams/variations to a hamete-joseki which resembles to whites bad 19-20 exchange !

Black 35 missed a simple, crucial, directly punishing ladder.

White played several non-shape moves and black had quite a good position. Allowing W40 was a turning position.

B139 was greedy/dangerous at least - I think you did not see nor calculate the semeai. 

B 151 was almost correct.
B 151 often can be a big mistake losing 4 liberties.
Please read the relevant chapters (bigger eyes)
in Richard Hunters
http://senseis.xmp.net/?CountingLibertiesAndWinningCapturingRaces
or the "2nd book of Go".

B153, 155 are very bad moves in a semeai (taking away own liberties).

W152 missed a big opportunity to play a game-dominating ko.

In the end, you have deserved your win, white played bad shape in the beginning, not to speak of the careless lower left corner.]

Besides this it seems an easier strategy to me to to reply low on on 6-3 (b) or pincer B5.

White should remain at a serious disadvantage.

Although there exists a hamete-joseki (hamete by black and black can be punished) where black cuts at 21,
then there is NOT the very important, helping triangled stone present (it halfway threatens to capture the 3 cutting stones in geta),
hence White has severely overplayed here.

There are no white stones helping globally at the star point and
white could/should lose either the 
pivotal 3 white cutting stones (X) and/or the corner.

Black 23 has the fee of an atari after which you do not capture something or cannot tell its precise use - vulgar !

You dont't expect white to pass and let the 3 stones be captured?!

I think that falls into the category of fuzzy-defined "fundamentals":
play efficient moves!

Just playing "d" has a purpose 
- harass the corner (because you can't capture the cutting stones in one move)
- then, either the corner dies or
- lives in gote (in the course of this having strengthened black)
- so that Black can capture the cutting stones.];W[go];B[fq]

This cutting group (W38) is not so important anymore,

both black side groups are reasonably settled/stable.

Hence, if white feels obliged to make unimportant stones alive or add stones there - black should feel happy.
By forcing white with F8, black adds stones to a (triangled)  black sphere of influence.]

At this moment of commenting I don't yet know the outcome of the game,

capturing the 3 white cutting stones G5 ff is unimportant.]

so why wasting 1 point (C12) if you must place B and C11 anyway?

If black simply captures 38 ff (4 moves),
black seems to lose endgame points around 39,

C[at this moment,
Black has a 6-eyespace eye 
with 12 - 3 = 9 inside liberties
+
2 outside liberties ( "b" &  "d"),
totalling 11 liberties in first instance.

A complicating factor is that after white "b" she could make an eye  "y" by  "x" which Black could not punish with  "c" , because  "d" is then the last liberty.

Black is further lucky that white cannot approach at "a",
therefore not capture by (cc).]
(;B[bn]N[B151 is necessary, but early]
(;W[am]LB[ap:b][bl:c][dl:d][aq:e][bq:f]C[W 152 is a mistake - white should go for ko by playing at "b" (=B153).

Excurs: The single move 51 "seems" to (might) have reduced blacks liberties by several liberties in one move !!

It seems as if black makes his 6-space eye without need into a smaller 5-space eye:
A  6-space eye has a maximum of 12 virtual fighting liberties,
a 5-space eye has only 8. In general the difference is 4 liberties !
(Here it was 12-3=9libs+gote vs. 8-1=7libs+sente; hence the difference seems to be only 1 move/liberty)

Actually white can take here an outside liberty by "b" and then could continue from the inside with W51, because pressing with black "c" would be self-atari, because of White "d". 
So you were right, white "b" forces B51 anyway which then could develop into ko at 52 if white approaches at "d".

Your move B51 is thus almost correct, but because of above reasoning you should have forced at "b" (next move B53) before B51. 
White could not stop at "e", but had to give in at "f".

In general terms - keep your eye as big as possible.

It would be painful for White to push 20-22 Black on the 4th line (there is no white stone "X" blocking black in hane) and
it is not a white sanrensei below, rather the lower right 3-4 is open for invasion.
Hence, the white strength 18-22 will not materialize in so much territory as to compensate the loss for pushing on the left.

Perhaps this was the consideration that she tried something else.]
