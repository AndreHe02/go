C[Hello jackiechen, this is your reviewer Olawi. I have tried to point out two things in this review:

1) How not to use thickness (or moyos) to gain territory
2) When playing a territorial game as this, it is important to see the value of moves; not to play small moves when you can play bigger ones.

Sorry if this is self-explanatory. Please endure the review. If you have questions, I will try to answer them. Please e-mail me or contact me at the KGS go server.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp]LB[dd:A][ep:B][eq:C]C[This move is better than A, because this way the approach at B or C is backed up by the marked stone.]
;W[dd];B[pj]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[The last move, making san-ren-sei on the side is not bad, but black could also develop fast by approaching the white corner at A or B.]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[qc:A]C[This move is quite normal when black is using the san-ren-sei to build a moyo. Black expects white to enter at A next.]
;W[qf]C[White chooses a different strategy, maybe to try to complicate things and prevent black from building a moyo.]
;B[nd]C[This is good.];W[qc];B[qd]TR[pj]C[This is the correct side to build a moyo in the marked direction.]
;W[pc]C[Here it would be simpler just to connect, see variation.]

(;B[oc];W[ob];B[od]LB[nb:A]C[Now white should play A.]
(;W[mc]C[This is a mistake, white leaves no aji to cut through black's wall and gets sealed in completely.]
;B[md]LB[rd:A]C[To save face, white should at least play A now.]

(;W[mb];B[lb];W[na]LB[ld:A]C[Black now has to protect the cut at A sooner or later.]
;B[rc]LB[ld:A][pg:D][ep:C][jp:B]C[This is too small. I recommend connecting at A or playing B or C for speed, D is probably the safest point.]
;W[rb]C[Q: Should I place at S16 instead ?
A: No, this territory is very small. Black should build a big moyo to use his wall effectively.]
;B[qj]LB[pg:A]C[I think placed at S16 is gote, so I choose to attact one white stone at R14.
Maybe a better way to attack would be from above? Perhaps A. Black is over-concentrated.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[rf]TR[qf]C[This exchange is bad for white. The marked stone loses much of its aji and white gains very little territory.]
;W[nq]
(;B[np]LB[ep:B][jp:A]C[Q: I want to build a large moyo in right side.
A: Thats a plan. Just remember that moyos can and will be reduced. I would consider playing a pincer at A or B.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]C[Again, just connecting is also possible.]
;W[or];B[op];W[mq];B[lo]C[This builds a good moyo, which was your plan. However, white will try to get territory and reduce your moyo.]
;W[kp]LB[nr:A]C[Here you could also try A.]
(;B[ko]C[This of course is a beautiful big point.]
(;W[lj]LB[jp:B][nr:A]C[Here black should attack. If black just gets the minimal territory that he can get from the moyo, he will suffer. Also A and B are *very* big points.]

(;B[nj];W[ll];B[nl];W[mm];B[nn];W[lh];B[nh]C[This result is *very* bad for black. You should not use your moyo to make territory, but to create a large sphere of influence and then attack white. This way, black gets relatively little territory and white gets influence in the center. I repeat: do not immediately take territory from moyo, it (territory) will come to you later as you attack.]
;W[dj]C[This is a very good point for white. It seems that the tables have turned, now white has strong influence in the center. The moyo could have been used more effectively than this.]
;B[eq]C[This is good, probably the biggest point on the board. It would be very big for white to play this.]
;W[ep]C[This lets black settle himself, but white gets to build a moyo.]
;B[fp];W[fo]C[This seems too weak shape for white.];B[dp];W[eo]
;B[do]C[Q: I don't want white to build a large moyo if black D3, white D5.
A: That is a plan, again. This variation will get difficult though.]
;W[dq]
(;B[co];W[cq];B[fq]C[This is getting very difficult. Black has weak groups on both sides after white lives in the corner.]
;W[gp]C[This is over-aggressive, but black must be patient.]

(;B[gq]C[Q: Is it ok to cut at G5 ?
A: I think not. White will have the advantage in fighting here.]
;W[hp];B[ir];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[dm]C[Good, this is correct shape. Black is weak on both sides, however so the game will be difficult for him.]
;W[fm];B[el]C[Moving out is correct. The lower side will probably live and black cannot afford to defend it in this game.]
;W[hq]C[White ties to kill, or at least torment the black group.]
;B[hr];W[er];B[fr];W[fs];B[gr];W[dr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lq];W[lp]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[ls]LB[jr:A]C[White could try to kill, maybe later, with A.]

(;W[jq]C[This is aji-keshi];B[jr];W[mp];B[mo];W[gs];B[kr];W[jn]
C[White makes himself strong. Maybe he could have already attacked the left-side group?]
;B[jo]C[Pushing here only makes white stronger.];W[io];B[in]
C[Q: I think this cut is bad.
A: Yes, pushing was a bad idea. Black should try to make his left-side group safe.]
;W[hn];B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[fl]SQ[il][im][in]C[After this, black must sacrifice the marked stones.]
;B[ek]
(;W[fk];B[ej];W[fj];B[di];W[ij]C[It was too kind of white to let the black stones live this easily. Whites profit in the center is small. Black is back in the game now.]
;B[km]C[This is small but..];W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[kk]LB[kj:A]
C[Here white must absolutely play at A.]
(;W[lk]C[This is very small, and lets black separate whites stones. Black can be very thankful, for this is not his own doing.]

(;B[lm]C[This is not absolutely necessary yet. White cannot connect. See variation.]
;W[bi]C[White probes.];B[cj]C[Q: I think F11 is better instead of C10.
A: Not necessarily. Making secure life also makes blacks position stronger.]
;W[cg]
(;B[fc]LB[kg:A]C[This is the last big point. If black gets all the territory from the right side, he is leading. Playing kikashi at A first would be absolute for black.]
;W[ke]C[White must protect his stones, so this is natural.]
;B[kd];W[le];B[mf]LB[jd:A]C[A is bigger.];W[ld];B[jd];W[je]
;B[id]C[White has only helped black to live on the side.];W[eh]
LB[bj:A]C[This could threaten the life of the black group. It would be wise to immediately make life with A, for example.]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[eg]C[This does not accomplish very much, there are not many points in the center. The side and especially the corner are much bigger.]

[cc:A]C[It would be biggest to invade at A or play B.];B[ee]
;W[gd];B[gc]C[Q: I think I should place at F15 instead.
A: No. That would not connect the stones and would endager the upper side group.]
;W[ed];B[cc]C[This is good.];W[cd]

A: Living is difficult anyway, some stones have to be sacrificed. See possible variations]
;W[an];B[bl];W[cm];B[cl];W[dn];B[em];W[rq]C[This sequence is the biggest on board, and white gets it.]
;B[rp];W[sp];B[so];W[sq];B[rn];W[he]LB[la:B][mi:A][iq:C][hs:D]
C[This is small. Now black must consider all his sente endgame plays and play them out. I have tried to mark some of the bigger ones with letters. A-D There are also big gote plays left. I apologize for not being very competent with the endgame, so the rest of the game is given with minimal comments.]
