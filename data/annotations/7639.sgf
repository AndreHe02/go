AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello, my nick is Wawl, I will try to share what I can, I'm currently between 1d and 3d. I'll add "W." before my comments. I also make mistakes, though I checked for them, send me a message if you find one =)

There are a few things I think could be usefull to you, a few question you should ask yourself before playing a move :

1) Is that move necessary ?
- in this game, there are a few moves which are either dame (no point), very small, or make you lose the initiative, everytime you play one of those move, it's usually said that your opponent caught up with one of the handicap stone he had given you at the beginning.
2) Do I need to answer to my opponent ?
- Your opponent is not perfect, he made some mistakes, and some useless move. You must read a little ahead to see if you need to answer his move or tenuki.

I believe these simple 2 questions can make you a lot stronger.

Another thing that would make you improve a lot would be to read more about the -other- possibilities that exist when you pick a move on instinct. For that, there is a simple and unique solution : tsumego :

W. Good thinking, the move looks perfectly ok.

I hope you thought you were winning because you counted, not because of your guts, if not, try counting more in your games. There are lessons on sensei's library if you want to have a look : http://senseis.xmp.net/?SteveFawthrop%2FCounting
