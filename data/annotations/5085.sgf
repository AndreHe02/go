AB[dp][pd]C[Hi,

I made some mistakes in the beginning of the game, that cause huge territory of black in the middle of the game.
I'd like to focus on them what is better moves in the beginning of the game.

DC:
Overall, the main weaknesses I've noticed are that you tend to overestimate your opponent's territory and think more about invading it than on surrounding your own territory. Secondly, when trying to reduce black's centre area you should have looked around the board for places to enter it. Other than that there were several tactical mistakes, but generallyl your play is good.]

(;W[nq]C[Now I see that this was not good, because black took all bottom. How should I respond  O4 in better way?

DC: Well, the usual answer to bO4 is wQ6(see variation), but you should be less greedy here; don't focus on preventing your opponent from taking the side, try to build territory for yourself. Only then if you see you are behind you would consider an invasion or a reduction.

Another possibility for white is to pincer somewhere on the bottom side, but the question is would it help white making territory? I doubt so.]
;B[mq];W[oq];B[mp];W[qm];B[iq];W[cn]
(;B[db]C[DC: As black I'd prefer to pincer the white attacking stone, both to put pressure and to strengthen D12. I'd leave the potentially messy corner for later, as even if white kills bD17 there still remains alot of potential(aji) for black to use.]
;W[ed];B[eb];W[dj]C[DC: This is a good move. This helps the weak C6 stone and potentially also the weak D15 group. I would be careful, though, as D15 can also be damaged from this attack.]
;B[fq];W[cd]C[DC: Making this move prior to attaching demonstrated an important strategic principle called 'leaning attack'. It means that white 'leans' - pushes against - the top only in order to make himself stronger for the move that follows. I'm not entirely sure this move is sente though.]
;B[fb];W[ch];B[ei];W[di]C[DC: This is good because it connects white and creates cuts in black's position, but I would consider C11 instead, to make stronger shape and less cuts.]
;B[bo];W[co];B[cp];W[bn];B[bp]
(;W[nc]TR[fb]C[This approach move is questionable. Black's marked stone is powerful on this side and will make it harder to construct a base on this side. Another reason to approach the other way is because of the white stones around R7 which will make it possible for white to make a much larger territory.]
;B[pf];W[kc];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[nd];B[qi];W[hb]
(;B[eg]C[This move does not accomplish anything for black. Black has now added a stone to a weak group. The stone does not help the group's shape and does not really make any eyes. It also encourages white to defend his territory in the area. Overall, black just made a weak group weaker, bigger and heavier.]
;W[dg];B[eh];W[df];B[en];W[dm];B[hg]
(;W[gg]C[DC: There is a proverb which is worth remembering: "Attack from afar". When white attaches here, playing close to black, black will respond closely too, probably with a hane. Next white will have to save his stone and at the end of the sequence white has not gained much yet black got stronger - a close attack provokes the opponent to strengthen himself. It should also be remembered that it isn't always easy to kill an enemy group, and that you should usually just chase the opponent in the way which is best for you or worst for him.]
;B[gi];W[gf];B[fl];W[cc];B[jg]TR[ng][nm]C[At this move I thought that I've already lost

1) The black F18 group's chances to live now seem slim, and even though black can probably make alot of territory in the centre, there are still possible reductions.]

;W[qk];B[jf];W[je];B[mr]C[At this move I bagan to panic :) I couldn't  imagine good invasion into black's territory.

DC: This is not the time to think about invasions. Useful reduction may have been made earlier(around move 35) at, for example, K4. But overall black's territory is not as big as it seems, and he wasted too many stones surrounding it.]

;W[og];B[rc];W[pi];B[ni];W[ph]C[DC: White has been very lucky here. This is a considerable gain, but the white stones had no chance of living if black made sure they didn't escape.]

DC: No. If white plays K5 black just connects at K3. If white cuts at K3 black captures with K5. If white H3 black would atari at K5 and white will be captured.]
