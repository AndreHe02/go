C[Hi,
This game was played between lvl 8 Gnu Go (white) and myself (black) on a 13x13 board.

I appreciate if you could sugguest where i can improve.

Thanks.];B[jc];W[cj];B[kj];W[cc]
(;B[ig]LB[ik:A][dd:B][ek:C]C[kklim> this move from i see is a bit of strange, what you want to accomplish for this move? surround the territory? if for me I will place either at following point:]
;W[ik];B[gc];W[fk];B[ef];W[cf];B[ec];W[ii];B[ji];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[kl]LB[dd:A][cd:B][hh:C][lk:D][lj:E]C[kklim> hi, personally I think this is no a good move (you play A, and white respond with B), as you place this move, your enemy will very high possibility to place c10, since your d10 move is needed to respond (sente move 先手). But by respond to your d17, white also enhance the territory, so i think white will be happy to settle the shape here [定型\].

personally i think propose two location is better or can be consider as well.

for move at D, if you do not take chance to place here, i think your enemy will place so, since once it settle down [定型\] will affect the yose [end-game 官子\] . Maybe someone will propose to place at C first which also can be consider. As right now, black moyo [potential territoryframework 模样\] is relative bigger than white.

If you play c, maybe white will respond at H5.]

;B[hi];W[hk];B[ih];W[lk];B[lj];W[db]C[kklim> please note white move 28, 30 is good move, as you need to respond]
;B[eb];W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[fc]TR[db][da]C[kklim> you need to enhance your skill at yose /end-game.  At least do not let white to over the triangle line.]

kklim> i personally suggest you play 19x19 board, and read some beginner level book on fuseki (opening), joseki (standard move sequence\], yose tesuji.

If you can read chinese or japanese, here is list of book you will find useful:-
Ishida Yoshio, Fundamental Joseki [石田芳夫，初级定石\]
Takemiya Masaki, Fundamental Fuseki [武宫正树，初级布局\]
Otake Hideo, Fundamental Yose [大竹英雄，官子入门\]

Hope i can help you advance in the weiqi mastery. And next time try 19x19 board.

Thank you.

(;B[jk]LB[jj:A][kk:B][jl:C]C[kklim> i think move 53 at k3 is more adequate, as white if plan A/B, you can take another A/B (miai 见合\]. I think white will place at k2 to prevent you take C to cut down on later move.]

take sente move to settle shape down (see illustrative move)]

;W[ek];B[dd]
(;W[cd];B[de];W[eb];B[gd];W[bf];B[dh]C[black to move 13 is joseki for take advantage of san-san (point 3-3) at low position, black take influence, white take territory.]

;W[ek];B[fk];W[dk];B[gj];W[ch];B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[fb];B[hd]
;W[be];B[dg]C[kklim> will the propose to be consider fuseki (opening) move adequate for your case? as both the two example all have moyo look, if you can defend and conversion it to become real territory will be big.]
