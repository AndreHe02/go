;B[pd];W[po];B[de];W[co]C[Unusual. White two stones do not work  well together.]

(;B[jd]LB[dc:A]C[Should be at A. As white took 3,5 and 4,5  positions on the bottom black should start  taking profit. Making a shimary is best.
see var.];W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[I would rather play a pincer here as black  has the marked stone in place and white  marked stone will work perfectly if white is  allowed to play on the side.]
;W[pj]LB[jc:A]C[Black marked stones do not make the  correct hi-lo ballance (K16 at A). White  stones on the side work beautifully.]

(;B[dc]LB[dj:A][jp:B]C[Good point but one gets the feeling black  fell behind in the development. Black is  concentrated on the upper side (all 9  moves).
I would consider A or B first.];W[ch]C[Too close.]
(;B[dj]LB[eh:A]C[Wrong direction of attack. Should be at A.]
;W[eh];B[ep];W[cq];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[be]C[Nice move. I would push once more and  then pincer the black bottom group. That  would provide safety for these two stones  and would serve as an attack.]
;B[jp];W[lq];B[pq]C[The game is practically decided here. Look  at the white marked stone. It limits the  expansion of both black mojos and is an  excellent backup for an invasion. All white  positions are secure while black just crated  another problem for himself.]
;W[qq];B[pp]C[In 99.9% this is a bad move. Black just  gave white the right side for an attack that  will gain nothing.]
;W[qp];B[oo];W[pn];B[mp]LB[np:A][lo:B]C[A is shape while B would be attacking  move.]
;W[lp]LB[ko:A]C[Crude. A would be the correct shape.];B[lo]
C[This will close white in but white has the  marked stone in place so this is bad.]

C[Could also be at A.];B[ql];W[qj];B[ol];W[on];B[om]C[White just gained 25pts in exchange for  black thickness in sente...]
;W[fj]C[Next he erases that thickness perfectly.  Black is falling behind.]
;B[qd]
(;W[ld]C[White lost patience. This could be  troublesome. Securing the side would be  safer.]

(;B[lc]LB[og:A][pg:B]C[Loosing move. Black should A or B first.  Lean on stronger stones for attack.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[kc];B[le]C[Black just forces white to live in blacks  only territory. This looses the game at  once.]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[jc];B[pg]C[Black uses his thickness (black gave up  the upper side for it!) to make a few pts  here while in process he secures whites  position here...]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[ri]LB[qh:A]C[A takes black liberty!];B[oj];W[id]
LB[ic:A][fi:B]C[A is shape. If black takes sente black B is  no longer an option.]
;B[je]C[White left a cutting point behind.];W[oi];B[pi];W[ij]
LB[hi:A]C[A is the shape.  This would be a good place for b to resign.  Since there is 4 stones difference between  you this could be treated as a teaching game,  but in a position like this black really has no  chances left and there isn't much to learn  anymore.]
;B[pk];W[rl]LB[rk:A]C[Should be at A.]
(;B[qm]LB[rk:A]C[Should be at A also.];W[rk];B[fi];W[ei];B[ej]
LB[ic:A][je:B][hi:C]C[As mentioned in previous comment -  although A isn't sente had white played A  and black not responded at B this ladder  would be good for white. This is what  professionals mean by shape moves - it  may seem slow but those are the most  effective moves. As it turned out - because  of the exchange (white atari for black B)  black has the option of cutting across. Also  had white played the shape move at A he  could properly defend his connection...]

;W[hj];B[fj];W[cd]C[This result is very bad for white but white  is so far ahead it doesn't change the  game. Black cannot really kill white  groups.]

;W[lb]C[This resolves a lot of problems for white.];B[ff];W[gg]
;B[ih]C[wrong timing. If this was first white would  have connected.]
;W[jg];B[ie];W[hd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]C[This is bad as white hanes and black got  nothing.]
;W[ab];B[gc]LB[dd:A]C[I like A better as it seeks life while  attacking.]

;W[ba];B[ca];W[jo];B[io];W[cb]C[As black can connect to the outside this ko  is not very useful.]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[bb];W[km];B[aa]C[black doesn't need the ko.]

C[Basically black fell behind in the opening.  The sequence in the top is especially bad.  That alone  is enough to loose the game.  You also didn't put much of a fight in the  middle game after white gave you the  chance to do so. All in all I hope you find  some use of my comments. I didn't have  much time so find me on igs (goran) if you  have additional questions.

Hope this helps.

(;B[ih]LB[ff:A][gg:B][ef:C][dg:D]C[Black is in a position to dictate the course  of the game. Start a kikashi sequence. This  move should be made before the A-B  exchange as now white is forced to reply  by connecting - afterwards he will play as  in the game. Black shouldn't be worried  about white C as he calmly extends to D  and next connects with the upper stones or  cuts at A.]

[gi][gj][ep]LB[pf:A][ng:B][ef:C][ic:D]C[Next this seems like a good point to attack.
Looking at the situation black should  consider his diamond marked stones as  thickness driving white into it is good  direction for black. The triangle ones are  somewhat difficult to see but if you look at  it they can be driven in two directions.  Toward A which is o.k as they connect to  the top or with white A toward B which  makes black even thicker toward the white  central group which is great for black. So  white will probably choose to go up but  black has an excellent move at D to aim at  there. Also as of now black started to  complete his bottom mojo with his square  group. White C is nothing to worry about.]
