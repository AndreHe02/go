;B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp];B[cp]C[b4 is a more classical joseki move.]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[do];B[dn];W[bq];B[co]C[Comment : I think this black opening is very inefficient

I agree. c5 was not urgent at this time. It was better to extend towards the top (c10 for example).]
;W[dj];B[ck]C[I think this is too defensive. I would jump into the centre  (f6).]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[bj];B[pj];W[od];B[pc]C[Emphasises the corner too much. White is threatening to get a very strong top and upper left side. I think I would have pincered with n16 or a wider pincer (m16/17, l16/17) to keep the top under control.]

;W[jd];B[gc]C[comment : I don't think this is a good invasion
Since whet happens after (big white moyo) is predictible.

White has an excellent position at the top and upper left side and Black has to do something about it sooner or later (exactly when is a difficult question and also a matter of nerve :-) ).  This seems to be a good point for invasion, although I may have preferred f17 or f16.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fc];B[fb]C[The outside is more important (f15?).]
;W[eb];B[hb];W[fa];B[ic];W[jc];B[ge]C[Yes.];W[fe];B[id]C[Very slow move. k18 was a possibility, or maybe more important push further into the centre (g14?).]
;W[fg];B[gg]C[Not efficient. k18 is still a point to consider, otherwise j14 is better than g13 to take Black's group out of trouble.]
;W[gh];B[fh]C[I think this is too aggressive. White's next moves are difficult to handle.]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[hf];B[he]C[Not efficient. Black's eye was not endangered. Maybe you should have helped your g13 h13 and f12 stones since if White attacks your g17 group you have either k18 to make life or j15 to escape narrowly into the centre.]

;B[jb]C[k15 before k18 looks reasonable.];W[kb];B[ia];W[je]
;B[ne]C[comment : I must have been absent. This is obviously useless

Yes. I think p13 is better locally but Black had better take the big point at k3 or nearby.]
;W[nf];B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[mc];B[kg]C[This sort of moves is better left for later. You must also think not to make things more difficult for your not so strong h13 group.]
;W[jg];B[mg]C[Fragile. This is not the right time to play here. Go for the big points (again, k3 or around).]

;W[jp];B[hp]C[comment : f6 was probably better

I'm not sure. What's fine with f6 is that it is safer  and threatens a cut at e9. On the other hand, Black's group has reasonable prospects of independent life, and h4 is really big.]
;W[fn]C[comment : no comment];B[ij];W[im];B[hm];W[rj];B[qk]
C[question : any good defense against what follows ?

 I don't think you could prevent White from living on the edge. The important thing was to try and keep him small and, if possible, finish in sente.]
;W[qh];B[ph]C[Connecting is very important but sometimes it is better to "sacrifice" a possible connection. Here, I think Black s9 was feasible.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[sk];B[ql]C[This is not a good defense against a watari (a watari is the type of connection on the edge White has just made). I think I'd play r6 here.]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[qn];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr]
C[I think I prefer q3.];W[rr]C[White took much on the edge. Black's wall can pay off if Black plays well against White's endangered stones in the centre. Note that after his last move at s2, White has a usable threat at q3.]
;B[nl]C[comment : prepares next black move];W[io];B[jk]C[h5 is very big.]

(;W[ho];B[kk];W[lk];B[ll];W[ml];B[lj];W[kj];B[mm];W[oq]C[You get the stones in the centre and take your own stones in the centre definitely out of trouble, but White has more than sufficient compensation because he took the bottom with h5.]

C[comment : from this point,
the game is finished.

Do not bother seeing the
rest : A lot of useless
moves and tries from black

OK, end of my comments.

Overall comment: You don't make too many tactical mistakes, which is a good point, but I think you need to look more for the really big points on the board. You mustn't let your opponent get there before you. Also, it might help to know a few elementary josekis (I mean just the first few moves of 3 or 4 really common and simple josekis). This will help you to come out of the opening with a less unfavourable position.]

(;W[kk];B[il];W[kl]C[You made no comment on this variation. If you mean it to be a better line for White, I must disagree. I think h5 was really the most important move for both White and Black.]
