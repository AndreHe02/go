C[This is one of the games where I really didn't know what hit me. :)
I had a huge moyo in the beginning (I think), but I failed to protect it. How could I have done better?

Reviewer> I'll prefix my comments with R>
I assume that you're playing black.

Hi - to the reviewer who reviews my review, this is my first review and I want to see that: -
a) I'm giving sound advice
b) Are my suggested alternative plays good enough, or are there better sequences that
    I've missed.
c) The weaknesses I highlight in my reviewee's positions - are they correct/complete?
Many Thanks for your time.

SD> Hi. At first sight, the comment you made looks pretty well, as you pointed out the biggest mistakes. I added some precisions when it was necessary. Answers to your questions :  Yes, globally you made correct comments. What i like is that you try to show the global positions and balance between influence and territory.
You add too many alternative sequences. This is not a good idea, because you may confuse the player. It's far better to make a simple comment on the biggest mistakes. Try not to review every mistakes. Just hightlight the biggest ones. Furthermore, you have to be sure of the alternative sequences you show.... And it is very difficult (unless you show a joseki).
Unless you have studied  the position a long time or that you are a very strong player (i mean top dan level) you should try to limit the alternatives sequences. Don't you agree it would be a pity to show a sequence than doesn't really work ? :-)
Another whay to convince you : if the player understand at least one or two mistakes that you pointed out , he will surely improve and you would have achieved your reviewer goal.
It is very difficult to improve faster than that :-)
If i had understand only one thing on each reviewed games that stronger players made for me in the past ten years , i'm sure i would be at least 6d now :-)
About your alternatives sequences :  I tried at the beggining to made comments on the alternative sequences you showed, but there are too many sequences, and it would take hours to study them correctly.
I think you may understand some things with the comments i made on the main tree (in other word the moves played during the game).
Last piece of advice : you should'nt made comments when the game is over. When black loose the opportunity to capture white group in the lower right area, the game was really over. Black player should have resigned, and i don't think it will help black a lot to comment further moves...
Hope my comments will help you !

(;B[fc]C[certen: I usually start games this way...could I have done better here?

and so it your F17 stone now. You can't save them both (see alternative).

(;W[dc]C[> Strange for W to play solidly here];B[cq]C[R> This will weaken your F3 stone and give W immense power at the bottom

W can afford this, since she has the corner *and* a wall.

[hb][ib][hc][hd]C[R> OK, at the end of this sequence.

W has: -

  Two solid corners.
  A strong wall at the top (Squares), can even pull off a reverse monkey jump, to "A".
  A strong position on the right (triangles).

B has: -

   Two weak corners.
   Some dead stones.
   This isn't good for B, and all W's strength came about by B forcing W to play that way.

Playing in the centre of the board is a bit premature, B needs *some* solid territory, also this
gives W sente.

W should use sente to demolish your right side, see slternatives

SD> As you said, w take the lead of the game, so black need to do something. If you imagine the limit of the white moyo, you can see that black move is not too close, so k10 is playable.
Another move to consider is the warriuchi at A. If white play C, black extend at D, if white E, black F. But black will surely suffer in this area.
A move at G looks also correct for black.]
(;W[gc]C[R> W doesn't need to play this, the stones are dead.

W has made a mistake, B has sente and should attack with it]
;B[cj]LB[jg:A][gn:B]C[R> Finallay, but why make W strong first? It would be far more effective if W was weak.

SD> it's impossible to attack white positions, as white has no weaknesses. Black should try to use his sente to reinforce his position, with A or B for example. Furthermore C10 should be at C11 , in order to get an extension whichever side white play.]
;W[ch];B[ej];W[dj]LB[gj:A]C[R> W is attacking you now. So you need to play in a way which gives you a strong position

SD> this is a big mistake for white :  1) white should play in order to enclose black in this area with a move around A (closing the escape door).
2) this is a contact move that helps black . Never touch a group you are attacking. Contact moves are only for defense purpose.]

wanted to do anyway.

SD> As the R7 stone was captured, it is playable to play the 2 focing moves. This way, you use all the potential of the captured stone.

Look at your positions now : -   o How many groups were you split into?

I used to play like this - big-moyo strategy, but lost lots because I couldn't keep it all
or my opponent would create a living group inside my territory. I was stuck at 15kyu for ages.

I recently switched to playing territorily - building small groups and expanding them - this
helped me tremendously.

I would recommend reading Charles Matthews'  excellent On-Your-Side series at: -

http://www.gobase.org/articles/matthews/fuseki/

This would help you out with your openings.

It helped me a lot, and Charles is very good at getting his point across.

I hope that this helps, and you continue to improve.])
