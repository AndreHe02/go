C[RLJ: unfortunately this game is incomplete, since I recorded it from memory and couldn't remember too well. But comments are appreciated on the moves given here, especially

strategic ideas. The move order may be wrong in some sequences, but the final shapes

are right.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp]

;B[ec]C[RLJ: heavy :-( hane on 4th line is better?



klin: This a normal move.];W[gc];B[cb];W[bc];B[ed];W[de];B[fe]

;W[nc];B[pf];W[hg];B[ci];W[dh];B[ei];W[eh]C[RLJ: not sure of timing of these forcing moves...]

C[RLJ: why did I play here? should jump around M14



klin: B definitely should ply outside.  W can't make two eyes already.  M14 is a possible choice.  J 14 is another one.]
;W[jf];B[if];W[ke];B[nb]C[RLJ: bad.



klin: B can use brute force at N15, W N14, B O16.  But you have to know the moves in fighting.]

;W[bb]C[RLJ: I think black is a bit behind, but its probably still a game (??). Estimate margin?



klin:  B is behind.  Too early to estimate the margin.];B[ij]

;W[jo];B[lh];W[le];B[ll]C[RLJ: turns out to be a dodgy shape...]
;W[jm];B[gn];W[hp]C[RLJ: not sure how it goes now... maybe B next at b6?

certainly the main action is on the left side now, where B makes 10pts or so.



klin: The biggest move is either S3 or Q18.  Both may be sente.]
;B[bn]C[RLJ: not sure that this what was played at this point. Anyway... I think that the game is still not lost for black. 013 seems to be the  biggest area, but I can't remember who played there first, Anyway, we played some stuff on the left side next, with white trying to threaten B's thinness a bit. I can't remember the sequences. Anyway, much later it went as follows,]

(;W[ln];B[mn];W[mo];B[lm];W[lp];B[kn];W[kp];B[mp];W[mq]C[RLJ: and W ends up winning by about 5pts + komi



klin: The pat 10 moves have proved that B S3 is huge.  If B plays S3 (before B6), W has to play M2 to connect.  B has N3 sente, the M6, N5 cut disappears automatically.  No comment beyond this point.]

(;W[ln];B[mn];W[mo];B[lm];W[lp];B[kn];W[kp];B[mp];W[mq]C[RLJ: oops. Big for white. White goes on to win by about 5pts on board + 6komi... or maybe

a bit more. I never felt that the game was going my way here... starting with getting heavy at the top.]
