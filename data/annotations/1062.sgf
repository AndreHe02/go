C[Hi!   Thank you for spending your time on this review.   I made some reading mistakes in this game, but there also occured situations where I did not know how to play. It would be great if you could give me some ideas. I added questions.

Thank you very much, Jorg.BTW, I played White in this game. :-)]
;B[qf]C[J: Unusual, but why not. Black wanted to try a new strategy.]
;W[dd];B[nq]C[J: Once again.];W[dp];B[jc];W[pc]C[J: Maybe this invasion is too early??

No, I think it is right on the money.
If black gets this point he has a perfect extension in front of his shimari.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[pd];W[od];B[pe];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[oc];W[pb]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[ne]C[J: Black has a lot of influence.

But white has a secure corner (not even a ko threat) and sente. White is quite satisfied.  
R8 is a nice point.];W[ql]C[J: The right side is wide open, so I tried another invasion to break Black's influence. Is this a good strategy?

Yes. Black's thickness is starting to look over-concentrated.]
;B[qp];W[qi];B[fc];W[fe]C[J: I don't want Black to become a moyo. Is this good?

No. Just playing the natural move at D14 would be fine.   Black let you off the hook with his docile reply though.]

(;B[gd]C[You don't have time for G15. You are making a wall of sorts, but there is nothing in front of it. Black settles right in and you come up short.]

(;W[ge];B[dj];W[ch];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[cc];W[dc];B[db]
MA[cl]C[Black has a weak point at X. The shape of his left side stones is improper.   You should give him a little profit in the upper left in exchange for sente. See C16 sequence.]

(;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cl]C[Good.];B[dl];W[dk]
;B[ck];W[ek];B[cj];W[dm];B[bl]C[It is better to take the stone and remove the aji completely.]

[fp][gp]MA[ip]C[At this point white has a comfortable lead by just taking the territory black is offering.   The only concern is the weakness in the upper left.]
;B[jo];W[lp];B[jl];W[ip];B[fl];W[el];B[nn]TR[jo][jl][fl]C[O8 feels like a "thank you" move. It forces black to connect, but it does not give white compensatory territory or thickness.

White would like to attack black's triangled stones, but the result would be dangerous to white's left side position. See M6 and following

R6 both defends the left and threatens to cut across black's thin stones.]

(;W[nl]C[J: Where would you have played?];B[ln]
(;W[qq]C[J: The corner looks thin. Because I feel content of the strength of my groups, I invade. Is this the right point?

Locally the point is fine.

The invasion is a little risky. It is not that you cannot live in the corner but your 3 left side stones will come under intense pressure later. Black should be able to swell the right center by much more than you will take away in the corner.]

[sa][ra][qj][rj][qk][rq][sr][ss]C[J: Black surrounds territory which is open at the bottom.

H19 is too small and too early.
Black's territory is open on the bottom on both sides. It is already small, so why play there yourself? You are ahead. Solidify your upper left and the game will be out of reach for black.]

(;W[ha]C[J: I play the monkey jump, before Black can close his side. Is this the right time?

Too soon. Black could ignore you. What if he cuts?]
(;B[hb];W[ia];B[kb];W[eh];B[jf]C[O12 seems vague. Are you preparing to peep at P14? Why not just do it now?

Better yet, E10 is very thick and promises more territory in the left center.

The key thing to realize is that you are ahead territorially. Play solidly and you will win.]

(;W[nh];B[ei];W[fh];B[rh];W[ri];B[lr];W[kr];B[so]C[Black is getting some nice end-game points here but you should just answere meekly. When you are ahead don't pick fights.]

(;W[ns];B[nr];W[ms];B[pr];W[ps];B[ls];W[sp]C[This was expensive. You had to take gote anyway, and now black has an opening into your biggest territory.

Notice that this is move 100 and you have already played 7 moves on the first line! Even so you are still a little ahead.]

(;W[hi]C[J: I think I made some mistakes during the endgame. If you have time, please have a fast look at the following moves and point out my largest mistakes. Thanks again for the review. Bye, Jorg.

Black lost a little bit more in the end-game, but I don't think that your problem is here.

The main problem I see in your game is negative thinking. You seem to spend most of your energy trying to destroy your opponents potential rather than building your own. That is a recipe for losing go games.

Your opponent is going to get territory no matter what. Notice that you were ahead for much of the early going and yet you were more concerned about reducing Black's small territories than you were about solidifying and enlarging  your own substantial areas.   In your next few games, try to make your opponent invade first by continuing to build your structures until he feels compelled to come in. You will enjoy the difference in the flow of the game, I am sure. :-)]
