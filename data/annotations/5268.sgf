C[A: Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and lost.
Any comments are welcome - especially general mistakes which I need to learn from for the future.

My questions are prefixed with "A:"

Thanks! Avi.

Hello
From this side Tomasz Slazok
i Hope my comment will help you.

I you have some other question you can always as me at  KGS my account  is Executore]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[do];W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[dr]
;B[dn];W[cn]
(;B[er]LB[ep:A]C[Executore: This is bad shape. Weakness at A is left. Better to play more lightly or tenuki]
;W[jp]
(;B[hp]C[A: I wanted to protect the weak point at E4

Executore: H4 is wrong direction and don't protect weak point at all]
;W[iq];B[mq];W[dm];B[fp]C[A: Is it overly defensive?
E: i think it's not a bad move, so it's ok];W[em]
(;B[gn]C[E: you loss your change];W[jn];B[gl];W[dj];B[jl]C[A: Pushing White to the right, inducing Black to gain territory there]
;W[lo];B[kr];W[mp];B[nq];W[mm];B[pm]C[A: I was satisfied so far
E: I think white left side is bigger then black beacuse of R3, S4 and other bad aji]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[E: I think you should play pincer];W[qi];B[qk];W[rd]
;B[qc]C[E: R17 is in my opinion bad move beacuse white group is alive now so its only few points in gote. i prefer to play something around E17]
;W[lk];B[nk]C[A: Trying to prevent linkage between two White groups]
;W[km];B[oi]C[you play in dame points E17 is much bigger. Go is teritorial game not kiiling game]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[rc];B[kd];W[fc];B[hc];W[fj]
(;B[ed]C[E: you erase all bad aji in white corner];W[ec];B[dd]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[bd]
(;B[eg]TR[bd][ce]C[E: bad shape- without C15 is maybe good but after exchange C15-B16 is better to play C13]
;W[be];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[he]C[A: A cut which I hoped will be resolved in favor of Black - but the results were not so successful]
;B[gf];W[ie];B[ig];W[jd];B[jc];W[ke];B[ld];W[jf]
(;B[id]C[E: dame points is beter to play G18 if you afraid of something]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[jh]
(;B[kj]C[A: Tryingto prevent linkage to to group below
E: bad shape is better to play double hane];W[ii];B[gh];W[jj]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[kk];W[kl];B[jk];W[kq];B[gj]C[A: White chose to protect the group below, so Black turns to attack the group above]
;W[hj];B[gk];W[gi];B[fi];W[hi];B[fh];W[mf]C[A: In the above sequence, White threatens to link his group to the group below or to the group on the right - I did not find a way to prevent this or take seignificant profit out of it. Was it possible at all?]
;B[of]C[E: The simples way];W[mh]
(;B[lh]C[E: bad move before this you can play kikashi];W[og]
;B[nf]C[A: I am not sure about this move. May be M13? I do not see how I can prevent the linkage even then.
E: This is sure bad move after M12 better tenuki];W[mg];B[lg]
;W[lf];B[ng];W[mj]C[A: Now I must take care of the L11 group - White has the J8 play.]
;B[ik];W[ej]C[A: This of course forces Black to save his G14 group]
;B[ch];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[cf];B[fd];W[gc];B[hg];W[ci]
;B[dh]C[A: In this position, I think White leads. I tried to close the gap in the following moves, but could not really do it.]
;W[mk];B[hb];W[gb];B[jb]C[E: gote play];W[jr];B[hr];W[lr];B[mr]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[ra];B[qg];W[rg]
