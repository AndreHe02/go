C[Hi,

I'd like a general overview and feelings about this game please.

I think I was a little too confident - counting a larger advance than I really had. So I played too strongly and surely too slow, and my opponent should have take advantage of it (when ? how ?)


Every pieces of advice are greatly appreciated :o)

Thanks !

Reviewer: Well if you had a large advance you usually try to play solidly, and not aggressively as you seem to imply.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[np]TR[qn]C[Kick - Extend is bad for two reasons:

1. It unnecessarily strengthens the triangle stone.
2. The corner is still open.];B[pj]C[Reviewer: You should extend to the third line - It works well with 4-4 and the fourth line is open to being invaded.]

(;B[gs]TR[gj]C[Reviewer: This move is sente and worth about five points.

Well the game is now pretty much endgame though there are a few questionable moves ahead, it's fairly adequate play. Black has maintained a solid lead through out the game, especially due to white's p12 move among others. He was indeed very timid and should have invaded more to balance the game.

If you have any more questions, you can pm me on KGS, my handle is Flight.]
