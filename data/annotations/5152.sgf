odif [15k\]: dear reviewer, i took black in this game, i felt that, although i won, some of my moves were either in the wrong direction or too slow. I have included some ? and if you caan help me with a review, i would be very happy, thank you in advancce.

Hi Robert,

My name is Frank.  I will be reviewing your game.  Comments are scattered throughout the file.  Hope it helps.

Frank];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[dg]C[Frank: From here, I don't think you should just leave the top left corner for the extension.  It would not be bad to just play joseki here.]

(;B[jd];W[qf];B[nd]C[odif: maybe a pincer around q11 would be better?

Frank: Either is fine I think.];W[jc]C[Frank: This is too early.  See variations.]

(;B[qp]C[maybe Q3 is better?

Frank: Not necessarily.  You should look at where you have the most potential to develop.  See variation for Q3's joseki.]

(;B[op];W[ri];B[qj];W[sl]C[odif: I dont know why he made this move. It seems like yose.

Frank: He was probably worried about you developing the right side, but yes, this is an absolute bad move 32.]

C[odif:game over b+3.5

Overall, not a bad game.  Playing for the center is quite risky most times but it worked this game because your opponent was adamant about gaining territory on the sides and corners.  You should work on your fuseki by picking up a book about it or finding some online reference.  Some general tips I can give is 1) to look at some opening joseki for specific moves and 2) play in areas in which you have the most potential.]
