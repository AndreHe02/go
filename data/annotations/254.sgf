(;W[cn]L[fo][el][nn][om][pj]C[I know this is probably premature. The sequence from a) to e)  is
probably
better.

break out.

MM: yes, very. W is thin in the middle. B is alive both sides, so this is only

a yose move.];B[fh];W[gh];B[ei]

(;W[hc]L[jm][jn][io]C[Overplay  ? My reading at the time told me that I could ignore black a)

(answering b) with white c) for example).

MM: real bad overplay. After B capture, w is weak, so should play carefully.]

ko threats if it came to a ko fight.

trouble.];B[kg]C[I was happy to see this move.];W[jf];B[kh];W[kf];B[lf]

just a fancy variation of this idea.]
