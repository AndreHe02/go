I tried to give just some very basic hints about how to approach the game.
Obviously I could make comments about every move, but I think it's more important to just pick up a few basic concepts so you can start applying them.
Welcome to go!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[ep]C[You're doing fine so far :)
It's easiest to make territory in the corners.];B[cp];W[do]
;B[co];W[cn];B[dq];W[dn];B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[fp];B[gq];W[gr]
C[This move is unreasonable because Black is immediately going to trap it with his next move.
You have to be careful near the edge of the board, because it's very easy to get a stone captured.]
;B[hr];W[hq];B[gp];W[go];B[hp];W[iq];B[ir];W[ho]TR[gr]C[Trying to capture Black like this is futile, because any time he wants he can capture the marked stone and he'll be safe.]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[jr];W[jp];B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[jn];B[ko];W[kp]
;B[lp]TR[hq][iq][jq][jp][kp]C[Now your group is going to die.
Try to take territory with your moves, rather than trying to capture stones.
The best way to do that is to play near the corners and the edges, trying to make territory against the edge of the board.]
;W[kq]C[This doesn't help, as you can see from what happened.]
;B[lq];W[kr];B[lr]C[You are trapped against the edge of the board.]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[ls];B[km];W[ms];B[ks]TR[lo][ls][ms]C[Now the marked stones are probably all going to die too.
It's better to give up on stones that are going to die than to keep on adding to them; you just feed more prisoners to your opponent that way.]
;W[po];B[hn];W[fo];B[hm];W[im]C[Soon you will be able to see in advance that this move is futile, because B can cut off all escape.]
;B[il];W[gn];B[gm];W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[fl];W[dm];B[fn];W[el]
;B[fm];W[gl]TR[im][in][jn]C[This doesn't accomplish anything.
Black doesn't have to worry about being captured, because he can capture the marked stones whenever he wants.]
;B[fk];W[dp];B[cq];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[dj];B[ek];W[bm]
C[You were able to make a little territory along the side, which is constructive :)]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[df];B[cf];W[ef];B[ce];W[de]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb]TR[cb][dc]C[You have to be really careful playing diagonal moves like this because of all the cutting points you leave.]
;B[cb]C[Did you miss that this was atari (threat to capture)?]
;W[ca];B[dc];W[db];B[cc];W[ed];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[fa];B[gb]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[ah];B[ai];W[ag];B[bj];W[cj];B[bk]
;W[bl];B[bo];W[bn];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[ff];B[fh];W[hi];B[gg]
;W[gf];B[he];W[nq];B[hf];W[ld];B[jd];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[le]
;W[me];B[lf];W[lg]TR[kd]C[The pattern you're making here is called a ladder.
You can see that it'll keep on repeating until something happens (hitting the edge of the board, in this case).
If you had a stone at L16, then you would keep on atari-ing (threatening to capture) Black, and he'd keep running, until he hit the side of the board.
Then you would capture him (try playing it out and see).
But in this case, because his group has an extra liberty at L16, you will never get to capture him...]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[og];B[nh];W[ni];B[oh];W[ph]
;B[oi];W[oj];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[pk];B[qj];W[rj];B[qk];W[ql]
;B[rk];W[sk];B[rl];W[sl];B[ri]TR[jf][kg][lh][mi][nj][ok][pl]
[qh][pg][of][ne][md]C[And now Black has all these wonderful double ataris (threats to capture two different stones) everywhere.
You should never start a ladder unless it will end up in your favor.
This also means that you should not try to run away if your opponent has _you_ in a ladder that works; you'll just be throwing more prisoners at him.]

;W[jk];B[ll];W[lj];B[mk]C[The main advice I would give to you is to play lots of games on a 9x9 board.
You will learn about basic tactics that way, plus you will be able to play more games in the same amount of time :)
You need to spend some time learning things like how ladders work, and how to make uncapturable groups.
I think that after you play a bunch of 9x9 games you'll feel a bit less at sea.
Good luck!])
