C[A: Hello! This game was played on February 1st on KGS. I played black. This game ends up being very close, but I believe that it would have been very different but for one glaring mistake in the lower right side. Thank you for reviewing this game, the teaching ladder is a huge help!

Bw: This is a good game - you feel strong for 13k, and the level of attention you're paying to your games will make you sure to improve quickly.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[ce]LB[po:B][qo:A]SQ[dc][jc][ed][ck][qk]
[co][do][jp]C[A: This opening seemed wide and I took advantage of it. Should I have approached the bottom left first?

Bw: I wouldn't say the opening is "wide," but there is plenty of room to approach white's corners. You could also consider inclosing your lower right corner at A or B. You can also play on one of the sides - one of the joys of the opening is that there are lots of playable options. Any of the marked spaces would be reasonable.]
;B[dc]C[Bw: This is fine];W[dh];B[gd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[ph]
(;B[qg]LB[pd:A][qg:B]SQ[mc][do][jp]C[A: Better approach here? I though maybe a space further away.

Bw: There's no need to approach here - nothing in particular is wrong with the move,  you're making the white stones uncomfortable, which is good, but they are light i.e. not easly attacked, so you don't gain a lot of profit by doing so you actually make them move solid. The space between A and B is a little cramped, especailly after the following exchange. 

Always look to play in the biggest space, especailly in the beginning - a move around the squared points would be better.]
;W[qh];B[pg]CR[pd][qg]C[Bw: Not the most efficent combination between these stones.]
;W[pp]LB[op:C][qp:D][oq:A][qq:B]C[A: This has been happening to me a lot in the recent past. This seems like a overly aggressive approach that can be punished pretty severely, but I have yet to work out the way to do so. The following seemed to work fairly well.

Bw: This is indeed an unusual move, that I'm unfamiliar with. You usually try not to touch your opponent's stones because they become stronger. It's natural to feel attacked when your opponent does something like this, but remember that it's also not usually possible to capture stones directly. Usually the correct response is to extend (at a or b) or hane (at c or d)

Remember the strongest attack is also to split your opponent, so always try to split your opponent and not be split yourself - I would try to maintain the connection between you're two stones, and split white's here.]

(;B[op]LB[pp:A]TR[qm]C[A: 19 is played because of the marked stone. Had it not been there I think that I would have played on the other side of White 18.

Bw: you can't really hope to contain white A this way - white has the triangled stone surrounded as much as you you have A surrounded.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[pn]
(;B[pm]LB[on:A]C[A: With 23 I try to contain White, which as is seen shortly, does not work so well. Better to play 23 at A and sacrifice the one stone to gain significant influence?

Bw: That would be one way to play (see variation) but now you're in a running battle, with your two stones and white's three stones both running and without a base - it's hard to see the outcome, but you could try to split white's groups here]
;W[on]
(;B[qq];W[nn];B[mp];W[oh]
(;B[co]LB[mf:D][fh:C][ln:E][do:A][fq:B]C[A: I did not feel threatened by White 28 - with sente I decided to approach the corner. Is there a bigger move/response to 28 that could have worked? My thoughts are as follows:
A or B)Seems like the better approach given my position in the lower right.
C) Limits White's expansion from the side, begins to build a moyo in the center.
D) Defends against invasion into my corner/potential side, expands said territory
E) Claims a bigger piece of the lower side

Bw: The game move is fine, though A or B would also work. C is no good - you can't build a moyo with this move, since white is already strong and high on the right side, (see variation)

E doesn't really claim anything, as white can respond on the bottom.

D is interesting, but I think the top is still too open. If you want to play in this are (which is a decent option, it would be better on the 3rd or 4th line. 

Always try to think in pairs of moves- you make one, and your opponent makes one, sadly we can never take two moves at once - though fortunately neither can our opponents.]
;W[gp];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk]LB[bl:A]C[Bw: Good, you shuold be happy when your opponents touch your stones so early - they are making you stronger when they don't have to. The decent at A is also possible]
;W[cj];B[iq]C[Bw: Good - black is in a good position here. Look at the board. Where is white's terrirory? Black still has plenty of profit on the lower right and the top.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bq];B[dp];W[cq];B[ep]LB[bo:A][gp:2][eq:1]C[A: I judged that extending here to reach further into the center from this base was worth the risk of White playing at A. Should White have taken this chance to do so? I played with the idea some in the variations.

Bw: This is fine - the black stones here are light - you don't need to make territory with them, just disrupt white's.]

(;W[eq];B[fp];W[fq]
(;B[ap]C[Bw: Too small - this would be better on the top.];W[aq]
;B[bn];W[nl]LB[ro:A]C[A: It is here that I made the big mistake of the game. I tried to run out with the two stones and White takes the key point the could have connected them underneath. I beat this dead horse for a long time and nearly lose the game as a result.

Bw: Yup - we've all been there. When you have so few stones against so many, it's usually better to give them up, though A could save them.]
;B[pk];W[qj]
(;B[pj]C[Bw: If you have any hope of running out in difficulty positions, it's good to touch your opponent's stones and keep moving, making flexible connections and sacrifices, see variations. (Still not a good idea, since it makes white strong.]
;W[ro]C[A: Having not taken 52 for myself, in hindsight I should have simply sacrificed the two stones. Maybe all four.]

(;B[ol]C[Bw: you don't have enough room to make eyes here, you have to run (see variations)]

;W[sm];B[sn];W[sk];B[rm];W[so];B[oi];W[ni];B[qi];W[ri];B[og]
;W[nf]C[Bw: This is an odd move - you should try to cut white's stone off]

(;B[nh]C[Bw: This doesn't really work, as you see];W[pi];B[oj]
;W[pl];B[rh];W[ok];B[mn]C[Bw: Not sure what you were going to this this move - the right side group is obviously dead now, and it doesn't make any territory.]
;W[om];B[go]C[This move likewise doesn't gain you anything - if you're not actively fighting for life(and even if you are) always think with your moves, is it sente? Does it help make territory?]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[io]LB[ko:A]C[Bw: White has helped you make a small amount of territory around A - but should  have waited to play here later - the moves would be better spent elsewhere]
;W[ld]C[A: White's invasion here makes me think that taking an earlier sente move here would have been prudent. The territory in the lower left side doesn't seem to make up for the loss of what could have been a huge side/corner.

Bw: Yes!];B[nc]LB[jc:A][jd:B][ng:C]C[A: I am also curious about better responses to this invasion. I though about cutting the middle of the field, but it seemed like a stretch to think that I could truly keep 88 isolated while White simply builds a base on the side. Maybe to limit the potential territory for White while losing a bit in the corner.

Bw: This response is good - the area is so wide open that you can't pressure white too seriously (since white can plat at C or run off in other ways. This move acomplishes two things at once, protecting the corner, and pressuring white lightly.]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[ie];B[gf]C[Bw: This move doesn't really put pressure on white's stones since they have the move at A to help escape or make life]

(;W[mh]
(;B[hh]LB[ng:A]C[Bw: Not sure what this move was for - playing at A would leave cutting posibilities and not let white off so easily.]
;W[ng];B[lb]LB[fh:B][fi:C][ki:E][ek:A][ll:D]C[A: There are a number of times in this portion of the game in which White goes after lonely stones and I have been trying to judge the value of each stone in a more objective light in recent games. This and the next I decided to let go of in return for some bigger moves - but I do not think that this one was big enough. A-E all came to mind.

Bw: The game move is okay, though A would probably have been better, since it secures about 10 -15 points around there. 

I'm not sure the purpose of B or C

E is only good if could also play D since it isn't sente and doesn't secure any territory by itself, 

D is okay, but not as good as A];W[kc]C[Bw: Unessecary move for white]
;B[md];W[le];B[me];W[kf];B[lc]
(;W[oe]C[A: Although I had been expecting this, I winced a bit when I saw it actually hit the board. Seems like a move to protect that corner more would have been a good idea.

Bw: Not sure why, this move takes away maybe 1-2 points from you, and you don't even need to respond to it - playing here as black gains you almost nothing. Not to worry!]
;B[pe];W[mf];B[kb];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[gb];W[ig];B[ih];W[fj]
TR[la][ma][mb][nb][mc]SQ[di][ei][dj][ej]C[A: The big swath of points that White claims with 114 here shows me that moving to claim this area for my own earlier may have been more useful than the five or so extra points gained in the marked area.

I wouldn't call it a wide swath, white gainst maybe 5-6 points, (squared) White wouldbe better at E9, but still, no big deal. The worse thing is it makes it harder for you to make territory in the center. Neither of you should take many points there, but you have more points on the board than white, so that's fine. You can still play at E8 to take even more points than whitejust did.]

(;B[hj]C[Bw: Wrong direction, think about surrounding territory]
;W[el];B[em];W[gl];B[il]C[Bw: None of the following moves are as imporant as playing at J2 (see move 160)]

;W[rg];B[rf];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[li]CR[jh][lk]C[A: It took me a bit to find this move. Still not sure of it, but it seemed to do the trick of keeping white out of most of the center.

Bw: This move is okay, but would M8 would have secured at least as many points,and doesn't leave that area open.]
;W[lk];B[kk]
(;W[lj]C[Bw: White plays along with your plan here, allowing you to solidify the center, but white should have jumped down to reduce your bottom territory.]

;B[fh]C[A: From here it pretty much solidifying borders. I was slightly optimistic but the 12 captured stones and the eight dead stones concerned me.

Bw: Yes, it's always rough seeing those numbers, since often your opponent has double that (the area where the captured stones were) but besides the 40 points incuding captures, white only has two small areas in the lower left corner and on the left side - so you're in pretty good shape.]

[ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[A: In the end I am up by 2.5 points. If not for the rank difference I would have lost from the komi. I have been studying and playing quite a bit and enjoying exploring the nuance of the game, and then I play and my games are often closer than I feel they should be due to a couple of avoidable mistakes. These reviews (and reviewing my games before sending them to GTL) has been a huge help in expanding my game. Thanks for taking a look!

Bw: Excellent game - it would have been much easier for you if you have given up the stones on the right, as you know. You also could have given yourself a huge advantage by playing at J2 before white, or playing on the top earlier. In general you played well - but you need to pay more attention to keeping sente. Don't hesitate to give up local advantage when it's only worth a few points to play in a large open area - always think about what your move is acomplishing.

You often fall victim to a common beginner mindset, which is thinking "well, if I get to move here and here, it will be good" or "if my opponent moves here and here, it will be bad." Always remember your opponent gets a move too, so either make a move that is sente (so that you can play twice in the area you want) or make your one move worth it. Don't rely on your oppnent to miss something. Likewise, don't worry that your opponent will do something that's not really possible.

The attention you paid to reviewing your game will serve you very well, I have no doubt you will be able to advance quickly. I look forward to playing you in the future!]
