AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Thanks for the review. I'll put some of my thoughts and questions down.

You played well at times, but you allowed white to break you up. With six handicap, you need to use your thickness. Put pressure on white's weak stones (they'll all be weak early on), and build up influence. Don't be afraid if he takes a few points here and there, just allow him to live small, while you build up strength. You'll take territory automatically. When white plays on the second line, as he did a few times, just press him down. It did take white quite a long time to take the lead, so I'm sure next time you'll do better.]

SQ[nc][nd]C[Should I of just let him live small with S14 instead?
This way, he is going to break out, and if you're not quite sure you can kill him, the best idea is to seal him in, and then turn your attention to the two marked stones.]
;W[rf];B[sf];W[qg];B[rh];W[qf];B[sd];W[qh];B[qi]C[Mistake here, as S11 is now a good cutting point for him.]
;W[sg]C[Doesn't seem like he even needs this throw-in

No, he doesn't.];B[sh];W[sc];B[ri];W[sg]
(;B[sf]C[Another mistake: he is not going to live in gote (with T15), but break out, because that way he can attack you. You should have taken sente here to strengthen your top group.]

Absolutely,  you're giving white an excellent chance to put pressure on you. You have six handicap stones already, you don't need another one. Take the fight to him.]

Better. Now you're attacking a strong group. And there is still aji on the corner.]
