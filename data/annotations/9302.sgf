C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS (~1-3 dish), my comments will be starting with W:

I am not familiar with the unorthodox board sizes 9x9, 13x13, 37x37 joseki etc, but I'll do my best to point out any things that seem important.

I have used the "Label Variation" for the viewer to better visualize the branches in the SGF tree.]

W: 4 corners equal victory in case your opponent does not capture the entire center. In order to win with 4 corners, you need to ensure life in the center as well.]
