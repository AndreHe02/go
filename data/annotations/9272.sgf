C[Hi,

Please make more comments in your game file next time before submitting.  This one is a little sparse.

Main takeaways from this game:

1) Make good shape.  White was constantly making points against you simply because White's shape was better on average.
2) Work on direction of play.  Your stones were not coming together into a cohesive strategy, and frequently you would make moves that hurt other groups.]

;B[dd]C[Letting white to connect seems a bad idea, so I choosed this move.

[kb\]: Why?  Butting against a stone like this is a local loss (and not joseki) so this move really needs to pay off.  G16 is normally a little farther away (H16) when the top right is Black, but this exchange is clearly "a bad idea" without serious payback.]
;W[ce]C[[kb\]: Wrong direction - White should absolutely play at C17.]
;B[cc];W[bc]
(;B[db]C[Seems like a mistake, isn't it?

[kb\]: No, this is the correct shape move.  Your variation with B18 is worse.]
;W[cb];B[dc];W[ba];B[ic];W[gb]C[[kb\]: Wrong, should be at least J16 so White can get farther out in the center.]
;B[ef];W[gf];B[cg]C[Not sure about this move. Doesn't Black have any more effective here?

[kb\]: D13 aims at B14 sente, but that's it; the play at D16 is costing you.]
;W[df];B[eg]C[[kb\]: Good];W[dg];B[dh];W[ch]
(;B[di]C[[kb\]: Too single-minded.  See variation.];W[ci];B[cj]
;W[bj];B[dj]C[[kb\]: Right idea, wrong tactics - now the strength is too far away for a brutal attack, as you have a weakness at F12.]
;W[bk]C[[kb\]: ...so White can play here, large, but slow and not really urgent, but huge reverse sente.]
;B[gh]C[[kb\]: This move needs to pay off at the bottom, which B9 is thwarting.]
;W[kc]C[[kb\]: Natural.]
(;B[hc]C[[kb\] ...? You're already overusing this move.  This move is VERY heavy.]
;W[fd]C[[kb\]: ...And this one is worse...];B[ie];W[eb]C[[kb\]: Unnecessary exchange.]
;B[da];W[hg]
(;B[hh]C[[kb\]: 1) Single-minded - instead, "make a sound in the east, then strike in the west", see variation
2) The "two brothers" are fighting each other: this push hurts your heavy J15 group.]
;W[ig]
(;B[jf]C[[kb\]: Painful move. See variation.];W[ih];B[nc];W[lf]

(;B[kg]C[[kb\]: When escaping is this painful, take your profit!]

(;B[he]C[[kb\]: wasted move - see variation];W[fe];B[ee];W[ke]
;B[kd]C[Maybe that's too ugly..]

(;B[nj]C[[kb\]: Too painful to bear!  see variation];W[lj];B[kj]
;W[lk]C[[kb\]: still have a chance to bend here];B[kk];W[oj]
C[[kb\]: too late - now White has the initiative.]
(;B[nk];W[ll]C[[kb\]: heavy.];B[ji];W[ii];B[il]C[[kb\]: Right direction, but might be a little too aggressive.]
;W[hl];B[ik];W[hk];B[hm];W[fk];B[fm];W[dl]TR[fk][hk][fm][hm]
[ik]C[[kb\]: I hope you are planning to make a giant seki with White's dragon with these moves!]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[hj]C[[kb\]: What???];W[hi];B[gj];W[gi];B[fj]
;W[fi];B[ek];W[eh]C[This exchange seems good for me, because White got only points while Black got influence.

[kb\]: ???? You let White take "only" 30 points plus securing the very weak White group (~15 points).  Did you get 45 points of influence?]
;B[dm]C[This aims to cut off D4 stones, but maybe Black shouldn't play in this area now?]
;W[el];B[fl];W[bo];B[dq];W[gp]C[[kb\]: White's play is flexible, but a little heavy.]
;B[ok]C[[kb\]: Good.  This move is HUGE.];W[qf];B[re];W[qj]
;B[gq]C[[kb\]: Good, this is the next best move.];W[kl];B[jk]
;W[hp];B[mm]C[[kb\]: Developing towards these central stones is small, as Black's group is already secure.  It's better to attack White's H4 group, or develop the center-right Black group towards the corner.]
;W[kn]C[[kb\]: Heavy.];B[jo]C[[kb\]: The White group on the left is stronger than it looks, so it's hard to get an attack going.]

[kb\]: Good idea.];W[en];B[no];W[po]C[Now all that happened is yose, excluding R5 area. So, the last question is: couldn't Black deal with N3 or R5 weaknesses more effectively?
(If you take some addtional time to see if any mistakes and comments in yose, I'll be very grateful).

[kb\]: I'll examine the lower right corner.];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq]
;W[mr]
(;B[bp]C[[kb\]: Lower right is much better - R8 plus S14 is quite damaging to the upper right White group.]
