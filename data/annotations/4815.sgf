C[Matheus to the commentator:
I am most interested in comments about the yose in this game.
I would also greatly appreciate some insights about strategy - i.e. how to deal with such a huge moyo as White was able to build.
There are also a few specific questions where I wasn't able to read out the situations.
Of course other remarks are most welcome :)

PS. I removed all in-game comments.

P: Hi, my name is Peter and I will review your game. I am about AGA 1k/1d, and I play on KGS as InExtremis. Track me down if you have more questions or if you would like to play a teaching game.

You play an aggressive game, which is usually a good thing. Just be sure to know when drawing back and solidifying is the right idea (e.g., R8 instead of R10).

After you have the wall, you had several chances to prevent or limit white's moyo. You ended up diving in to a fight which could have lost you the game. You came out unscathed, but after such a great beginning there is no need to start an all-or-nothing fight.

The endgame was rather short, actually, and you seemed to do fine. It might be good to brush up on]
;B[qd];W[ed];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qi]C[I think this was overplay by White. Is R9 really the best answer?
----
P: A play at R10 is quite reasonable (even more so if E16 were on D16). Black is happy to extend from the Q4 stone, so this is probably not ideal for white. It is not disastrous, though, as white can settle with r14.

R9 is a good response.];B[qk]C[P: Black is happy to attack and extend with a single move.]
;W[qf];B[oj]C[Here I wanted to punish White for coming so close to the shimari. Is it possible to kill White here?
----
P: Rather than trying to kill white (impossible, I think), focus on attacking white while gaining territory or thickness and forcing white to live small and confined to the edge. If you complete an outer wall--with no major defects-- in exchange for allowing white life with just two eyes, you will have an easy game. Think of it like this: white will spend 5-10 moves creating two points while you will spend 5-10 moves that will have an effect on all fighting for the rest of the game. Clearly you will do well even if you don't kill.

The P10 attack is good for this reason.];W[np]C[P: White should probably manage the weak stones before starting another group.]

(;B[re]C[P: This allows white to sacrifice S16.];W[qe];B[rc]
;W[pd];B[qc]
(;W[of]C[P: This is not correct shape.];B[pf];W[pe]TR[pf]C[P: This exchange breaks up white's shape, but it also reduces your own liberties (you basically force white to hane at the head of three stones). This bad aji may come back to haunt you when you try to use the thickness. Just something to keep in mind. :)]
;B[ne]TR[oc][qc]C[P: This isn't as severe as it looks. If you want to cut, simply cut. If you want to put pressure on white it is better to back off a bit and stay strong while harrying white. This move comes back to haunt you.
Remember -- your goal shouldn't be to try to kill white unless you can actually do it. With O15, once white settles the marked stones will be thin and easily disconnected.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qh];B[oh];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj]
(;B[qj]C[P: Gah! This kind of move should be used only when you see a winning attack. It 1) does not really make that strong of an attack on white, 2) leaves cuts at R8 and around P9, 3) plays against the proverb by forcing white to "hit on the head of two stones." You seem to want to kill white, but if you try to do it like this and fail your position will be in tatters (try playing something like this in a handicap game and see what happens!). If you back off a bit you are guaranteed a very good result; there is no need to risk everything for an immediate win.]
;W[rm];B[ql]C[I haven't been able to find a better move. Is there any (perhaps a move or two earlier)?
----
P: R10 should have been played at R8. At this point R8 is the proper move, since white is crawling along the edge making barely any points.White may have been able to play R8 instead of S7, which could have caused a little more trouble.]
;W[sl]
(;B[rf]C[P: This push doesn't really help you much since it leads to the weakness you discovered in the game. Rather, cut instead! See variations regarding white's attempt at similar attacks without the S14-S-13 exchange]
;W[rg];B[qn]C[P: Good! This is also a big move. Of course, now white can do the game sequence, but I still like R6.]

(;B[oe];W[qb]
(;B[rb];W[sd]C[That was unexpected. Is there any way to defend all the stones?
----
P: Not at this point. Go back a few moves to look at the variations. Really, the weakness relates to the s14-s13 exchange and way back to O15.]

(;B[pb];W[sf];B[nb]C[OK, White has escaped and Black has a huge wall. How to use it best (I feel that most strong players would prefer to be Black now).
----
P: Even though you ended in gote and lost a couple stones, white has merely 8 sure points on the right side while black has overwhelming thickness. Black is absolutely in a better position.

How to use thickness? That's a rather big question. The primary use of thickness is in attacks. You can begin by playing G4, then K4 to hassle the O4 stone. If white simply takes a large lower left corner, you can threaten to take the side and/or the center in a large way.

A related use of thickness is prevention. The proverb "don't play close to thickness" You can play C16 without worrying about white creating thickness on the other side--it'll be hard to convert that thickness into anything useful with that giant black wall staring right back. Also, O4 cannot hope to be of much use to white for this reason--there is not much room to expand.

Often you want to get your opponent to play in between the thickness and one of your other groups. You can spend moves only on one side (not by the thickness) and then turn around and attack the other side with the newfound strength. Somewhere in the two attacks you are sure to profit.

If you never get a chance to use thickness in these ways, later on you can convert it into territory. This is not a terribly efficient use of thickness most of the time, though, so don't do it unless you 
With this kind of thickness, though, if you just play a conservative game you should not have trouble.]
;W[cd];B[ro]C[P: This move takes out most of the bad aji in the corner, plus it picks up 8 points. I would still rather play D10 to prevent a white moyo while you have the chance.]
;W[kp]C[P: L4 is too close to black's thickness. D10, H17, K4 seem like the big points right now.]

(;B[hc]C[You might even go a little closer. D10/C10, however, is now the biggest point.]
;W[dj];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]
(;B[dc]TR[fj]C[Now White has a great moyo. I feel Black should have played elsewhere buy I have no idea where.
----
P: If you are worried about the moyo, reduce it rather than build it! The thickness white produces from this attack is a little scary. The capping play seems appropriate here.]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[gc];W[fd];B[eb];W[hb];B[ib]
;W[hd];B[ic]C[P: 10 points on the side while white *greatly* expands his moyo. Now a black invasion has only one place to run (the right side).]

(;W[hj]C[P: Fortunately for black, white jumps out a bit too far. Why is this too far? H10 and D10 are not connected, black still has aji around G16, the giant black wall indirectly helps invasions, and H10 will most likely end up being a liability.]
;B[fj]C[During the game I was afraid it's too late - I wanted to play here before White strengthened his position.
----
P: I won't go through the many variations, but I would be nervous about my prospects with F10. ;)]

(;W[di]C[P: White is trying to help black? :)];B[eh];W[dh];B[eg]
;W[dg]C[P: If white just wanted this much territory he really should not have played H10.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[eo]C[P: This is not so severe. D4 connects easily to D10; E3 can run to L4.

E5 and E4 help white, but you manage to get some use out of them later in the game.]
;W[hl];B[hg]C[P: Good move!]
(;W[kk]C[P: An odd move. It surrounds some space in the center... kind of...]
;B[ep]C[P: These two stones should be swallowed whole in white territory.]
;W[dn]TR[ep]C[P: White is happy to make this exchange: it strengthens him while getting another captured stone.]
;B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[gm];B[hk];W[ik];B[hm]C[Perhaps there is better way to cut through White stones? The move White played next makes me think there must be a better way.]

(;W[hi];B[ii];W[ej];B[hh]
(;W[gr]C[I'm not sure why White didn't play F11, capturing 3 stones and making Black stones run in the direction of Black wall.
----
P: Consider this the first big question of the endgame. Capturing the stones would have been around 18 points in gote. G2 strengthens the E3 stones, ensures that E4, E5 are captured and locks up much of the lower side as white territory, probably worth more than 20 points.]

(;B[ef]C[This was to protect against F11 and threaten D14 (which as of now seems not to work).
----
P: This is big endgame, but now white gets two of the big endgame points (G2 and P3)]
;W[or]C[P: P2 is also a large move, threatening your corner while taking points on the bottom side. However, it should be played at P3.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pr];W[nn]C[P: I'd rather play J15 as white (sente) and then come back to O6 as a big gote point.]
;B[iq]C[I was eyeing cut at K9 and trying to make a stonger position by threatening to capture G3 group.
P: Good idea to get some use out of all that aji!]
(;W[ho]C[P: Considering the aji of the K9 cut, maybe white should attempt a riskier--but stronger--response to J3. This might win the game for white.]
