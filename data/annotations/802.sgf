Result: W+0.5];B[pp];W[pd];B[dc];W[dp];B[de]LB[ce:a]C[Since this makes the next move good - both a sort of extension from 2, and checking the extension from 3 and 5 - perhaps the shimari on the 3rd line would be better, at "a".]
;W[jd];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf]C[This (9) is bad: normal joseki is to the left of 7.  The centre is more important than this.]
;W[re]LB[pf:a]C[Again, to the left of 7 is more important.  It puts pressure on 7 and 9, and strengthens the connection to White 6.]
;B[qi]LB[pf:a]C[This is OK, but still "a" is a good move.];W[cn]
LB[jp:a]C[White 4, at the 4,4 point is better at fighting, influence sort of games, where you try to surround, or threaten to surround the opponent, by forcing him to play inside your moyo (potential large territory).  I think a would be better since it stops Black making this large moyo, and is a similar sort of extension from 4.  White 4 is not so efficient at surrounding territory.]
;B[qm]LB[jp:a]C[Better at "a".  This move makes "a" even more important since it is the important point for both sides, and White can play it first.]
;W[cg]LB[jp:a]C[a is urgent.  This is a good spot though.];B[cj]
C[Good.];W[fd]LB[eg:a][dh:b][be:c][cd:d][hd:e]C[Not sure about this.  14 is the weakest stone, and should be strengthened.  a, b, c, and d strike me as possibilities.  This approaches strength.

On the other hand 14 is still flexible, and this takes away the fairly efficient extension at e, and makes d more of a threat.

"a" would be my first choice.];B[bf]LB[hd:a][ef:b][eg:c]C[This is too submissive.  White has got in 16 *and* pushed down with 14.  I am sure 17 should be a move to split 16 and 14, avoid being surrounded, and threaten invasion at "a".  I think "b" or "c".  "c" would be my choice.]
;W[cf]LB[eg:a][ce:b][cd:c]C[This invites Black to strengthen the connection between 3 and 5; it may be aji-keshi, i.e. if you just run away at "a", you might later want to play "b" or "c"; with a Black play at "b" this is no longer possible.

On the other hand it is a way to help settle 14  whilst breaking the connection between 17 and 15.   On balance I would play "a".

There is a proverb to the effect that a one-point jump towards the centre is rarely wrong.  (I.e. "a").]
;B[ce];W[bg];B[af]LB[be:a][ag:b]C[Better at a.  White can force again at "b" this way.]
;W[eg]C[Good.];B[cl]C[Good.];W[fq]TR[eq]C[This enclosure is not normally seen: normally tighter at the triangle.  I have not seen the detail in a book, but although an invasion is not possible at the 3,3 point (unlike when there are two large knight's moves from the 4,4 point), it must leave some bad aji, perhaps something like the variation.]

(;B[jq]C[Good.  I think the fourth line would also be good.]
;W[pq]C[Good];B[oq];W[qq];B[qp]C[Black has got to give something away here: this may well be the right side to check him.]
;W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]C[This makes 13 in an unfortunate position.  White's invasion is a success.]
;B[jn]C[This looks a good strategy, although 13 is not in the ideal spot.  It would work even better if Black 9 were on the fourth line.

 It threatens to surround a large area, and lends a hand to the weakish stones on the left (15 and 23]
;W[ec]LB[cb:a][bd:b]C[A good idea.  Since the Black stones are more-or-less surrounded, this is probably forcing: if  Black ignores it, White moves at "a" and "b" sometime look vicious.]
;B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[pf]C[Yes, somewhere round here must be good - the junction between the two large moyos.]
;B[md];W[nd]C[Don't play in contact with stones you wish to attack: you allow them to lean on you and get stronger.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[nc];W[oc];B[mc]LB[ne:a][od:b][qc:c]C[Since these stones need to escape to the middle, one should get in the atari at "a" first.  The reason for not doing so would be if making him connect at "b" takes away something else, say an invasion at "c".  I don't think this is a possibilty here.]
;W[ne];B[me]LB[lf:a]C["a" is my first thought, a bit faster.]
;W[mf];B[lf]
(;W[ke];B[le];W[mg];B[kf];W[jf]LB[kd:a][kb:b]C[One would like to be able to play "a" in sente, so one might think of "b" first; but given the weakness of the white stones on the left, I think this is good.]
;B[kd];W[jg]C[This leaves too many holes.  It is necessary to connect.]
;B[jb];W[je];B[ib];W[gc];B[oi]C[Right idea, I think.];W[pj]
C[Interesting idea.];B[oj];W[mk];B[ok];W[mm];B[mi];W[jl]C[All good stuff from both sides.]
;B[ml]LB[fk:a]C[Don't play in contact with stones you wish to attack.

A move which strengthens 15 and 23  - (increasingly weak) - and threatens to attack the central white stones would be a good idea here, e.g. "a".]
;W[ll];B[nl];W[kn]C[This threatens to cut Black 37 off.  It can be a good idea to play in contact with enemy stones if strengthening yours is more important than the expense of strengthening theirs...]
;B[ln]C[... but this looks a bad overplay.  See variation.]

(;W[lm];B[ko];W[mn];B[km]C[This sequence makes a good job of rubbishing the black moyo, but leaves the white group a little open to attack.  Not bad, though.]
;W[kl]LB[jk:a]C[Rather slow.  How about "a" instead?];B[jm]
LB[fk:a]C[This tends to lend a hand to that weak Black group; helps keep the pressure on the weak White group, but the White group will be fine with one or two more moves, so this move will be very small.    A move to strengthen the weak Black 2 would be best.]
;W[lo]C[Accomplishes nothing.];B[lp]C[Also very small.];W[mo]
LB[fk:a]C[There are urgent moves.];B[on]C[Still very small compared to the unsettles situation in the middle and left.]

(;W[qh]C[See variation.];B[rh];W[mj];B[li];W[nk]C[This exchange takes away a liberty for White, on his weak group.]
;B[ol];W[il];B[hn];W[em]C[Ah! the right idea.];B[ej];W[ff]LB[ii:a]
C[White sees a potential weakness, but it is a long way from a threat yet.  "a" would practically join on the very weak white stones, and help the White group on the left.]
;B[ed]LB[fk:a][gj:b][gl:c]C[Not urgent: very unsettles situation in centre.  White can mout a big attack on the isolated black group (e.g. a or b), and similarly White 100 etc are very susceptible to attack.  E.g. c.

If White now attacks the weak Black group he makes territory and rescues the weak White stones.

This move does lose a lot since White plays well.];W[fi]C[Right idea.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[cm]LB[bk:a][fk:b][fl:c][el:d]C[Horrible shape.  Better shape locally would be "a".

b or c would be better, maintaining an attack on the weak White group, and reaching out for Black 101 etc.  d is good shape.]
