C[BW - hello reviewer.  thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  the main reason i decided to submit this game is because i felt very optimistic throughout - i had all four corners and a stable group in the center - yet i lost!  although i didn't count, i was surprised that the game was actually so much closer than i had assumed.

Shane - Hello, I'll be reviewing this game. I play under smonds3 (1d) on KGS. Feel free to contact me with any questions.]
;B[pd]C[This was a game of many opportunities but only some of them were seized. This game had many turning points and there were MANY moments for one of the players to turn the tables. As a result, the game swung back and forth until it came down to who played better yose.

Thanks for the opportunity to look at this game.

( I have included many comments, but the majority were on the first part of the game because this is where there was the most missed opportunities.)]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[cd];W[ec]TR[ic]LB[hd:a][gc:b][cg:c]C[Here white's fuseki goal is to seize the initative by approaching two corner's immediatly. White should try to use this strategy to find a way to develop the 4-4 stone.

Black's most normal response is A (or triangled point), pressuring white while also developing the Q16 stone. 

B, is not quite right in this fuseki - see explanation

C, is actual game, and quite passive.]
(;B[cg]LB[de:a][df:b]C[Black 7 is passive. Black's upper right 4-4 stone is his only unapproached stone, it makes most sense to look to develop this stone by pincering white's approach.


Black 7 is very low and therefore is not as severe on white's approach as even a move at A or B. In addition, because Black 7 is so low, it does not threaten to build a large territory on the right. 

Because Black has played passively, it seems best for white to play active ( to be consistant with his two approaches). 

It is best for white to look for a natural way to develop his 4-4 stone. See variations.

(Also I have given some examples for how white might play if black decides to pincer white's top side approach)]
(;W[hc]TR[ic][jc]LB[dc:a][df:b][cf:c][dd:d]C[White 8 is very passive too, because black 7 was low, it is not needed to defend so near. If white decides to defend the top with one of the marked points.

Firstly, with this two space extension, black can later play at A which will make white overconcentrated while closing the corner.

Secondly, with white 8 so near, white cannot gain much from the exchange of White B, Black C, White D.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qq]LB[hc:8]C[Up to this point, I prefer black's opening. White approached two corner's immediatly to try to gain some initiative. In doing so, he did missed a chance to gain momentum to develop his high 4-4 point stone. Most of white's failed opening was due to White 8.]
(;B[mq]C[Black is already low on this side so another 3rd line move does not make for a very developable position. Playing along the right side takes advantage of the largest open area. See variation.]
;W[qp]LB[pp:a]C[White 16 is a little soft. 16 at  A would be better as it takes a liberty away from black's stone.]
;B[qm]C[Black 17 is somewhat jealous. Defending in the upper right is larger territorially and more urgent than this stone so near white's strong area.

Because it is so near white's strong group, it will not easily make territory and white is already secure. Black gives white a target. White should attack.]
(;W[oq]C[This move is somewhat big, but white is already settled in the corner (plus he can move out anytime). 

This misses the opportunity to attack black's overplay];B[np]
LB[qj:a]C[Since white misses the opportunity to punish. Black should fix his shape at A.]
(;W[pk]C[White gets the correct idea to attack. I prefer attacking from one space further so that it is more natural to approach the corner. (see variation)]
;B[om];W[qf]TR[pk]C[White's approach here is good, but this shows why the marked stone should be one point closer to White 22.]
;B[qh]LB[pi:a]C[Black seeks complications by fighting. 

However, considering that this fight is going to push out into the center. Attacking higher at A feels more natural]
(;W[pg]TR[qh]MA[pk]C[This is white's crucial mistake. The marked black stone is weak. Touching weak stones generally makes both groups get stronger (because each stone is likely to get more libeties and extend).

In the fight that comes, white damages his marked stone.

Also, W24 has less effect of the corner.];B[ph]C[White now is at a loss for a good next move.]
(;W[oh];B[rk]C[Too passive from B, he can play this later if in emergency.]
(;W[rj]C[This only makes black stronger.];B[qj];W[qk];B[ri]
;W[rl];B[sj];W[rm];B[oi]C[White's attack failed because now black is secure. and white still needs to settle his three stones.]
;W[qn];B[og];W[nh];B[of];W[qc]C[Good! Taking corner is valuable]
;B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[lc];W[sd]
C[BW - too soon?  i felt like it was double sente.];B[se];W[sc]
;B[re]C[This was good enough for W. The game is now unclear.]
;W[cb]C[BW - Perhaps a move in the center would be more appropriate at this point?  B's influence looks pretty big.

This move is large and almost sente because black's two can now be attacked. Also, it secures these two white stones which could be vunerable if black plays in this area. In short, this corner is security and territory for both, so it is important.
Good move.];B[cj]C[This secures black but maybe is a little too passive. Black's best attitude is to try to build some center and deal with these stones later.]
;W[ni]C[Very big. Best point. White is starting to take the lead.]
;B[oj];W[pj]LB[nj:a]C[This move is a mistake, black doesn't need this connection.

Pushing again at A would be adequate, then making shape in the center seems easy enough.]
;B[nj]C[Yes. Black keeps white separated, now the game is unclear again.]
;W[ki];B[ol];W[pm];B[lj]
(;W[lh];B[ic]C[This attachment feels awkward. Black's potential in the center seems most important.]

(;W[jm]C[BW - I felt like I had successfully forced B up to this point and was trying to gain a stable center group.

Yes. White should feel mostly happy. Although there is a better way to secure the center (var.)]

;B[hj];W[gi];B[im];W[if];B[jn];W[gg]C[BW - last two moves allowed us both to gain stability.  Was that a fair trade?

Hmm. Almost. Black seems to be better off because can build more around the center and now white has some bad aji on the lower side. White though was in more trouble than B so he is relieved.]
;B[cl]
(;W[bm]LB[cr:a]C[BW - At this point I felt good and that I could afford this big endgame move.  I had 4 corners and a stable group in the center.

Counting now, I get about 52 for W and 58 B.  Oops!  Gee, I guess counting works! :)  However, that is still surprising to me.  Why was my feeling so wrong?
