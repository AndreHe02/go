C[Hi,
I'm a KGS 7 kyu and my user is sjd123. If you've got any questions you can e-mail me or send me a message on KGS. Hope this review helps...]

[ck:A]C[Your first mistake. You should try and strengthen the left side with 1 or 2, or maybe approach at 3. E3 only strengthens white, and stops you from doing an invasion at A later in the game]
;W[dk];B[dl]LB[de:4][je:1][ke:2][kf:3]C[There are bigger moves at 1,2,3,4. D2 is very small.]
;W[cl];B[em]LB[dl:1]C[E 1 is even smaller. it doesnt matter if w captures 1, its only worth about 4 points.]
;W[id];B[je]C[k10 is more solid here. This leaves you with cutting points (see variations)]

(;W[jf];B[kg]LB[kf:1]C[1 is much better. as it is harder to cut.]
;W[ie];B[kd]C[Strange move :) Just play k10];W[ke]C[Because now w can do this....]

C[Awful w mistake, you're let off.];W[hf];B[jf];W[jh];B[ih]
;W[hg];B[ji];W[ej];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi]C[This now leaves w with a good move at f2, see variation.]

(;W[eh];B[fh];W[ei];B[fg]TR[gh]C[You need to protect the cut here.]
;W[ff];B[gh];W[eg];B[cm];W[bm];B[dm]C[W still has the move at f2]

;W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[hh];W[fd];B[gg]C[Dont just atari for the sak of it, just because you atari, doesn't mean your making a good move.]
;W[ed];B[jb];W[ib];B[ja];W[ia];B[bh]C[The game should be over now. Its about even, maybe b is just ahead.]

(;W[kk]C["MattKyu [21k\]: ?"

Yes, it was a very ambitious invasion, your're right to question it. L3 is just rude.]
;B[tt]LB[jk:1]C[Perhaps your techincally right to pass, but you're going to have to work a lot harder now. When your ahead by this much, just kill the game off with k3.]
;W[jk];B[fk]C[Well spotted, but about 50 moves late :(

Now you've given w 3 free moves. W should live now.];W[il];B[ij]

Just be careful playing overplays like you did at the beginning in the top right. If you've got any questions, you can e-mail me. I reccomend you do some life and death problems from www.goproblems.com. Good luck!]
