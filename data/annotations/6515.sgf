C[yoyoma:

In this game, first there was a double pincer in the upper right.  Black choose a simple joseki, but probably not the best.  Personally I have very little experience with these as well, I was happy for the motivation to study them a little more myself.

The second major point in the game was when black chose to pincer in the upper left.  Generally if you give up the corner in this way you must get very good compensation outside, I don't think that was the case here.

There was a trade of sorts, and black got a wall.  But then it seemed like black tried to make points directly with the wall, instead of pressing white against it.

Finally there was a tactical error in the upper right.];B[pc]
C[Scipio [4k\]: hi
peterchris [5k\]: hi hf];W[pp];B[dd];W[qe];B[cp];W[nc]C[yoyoma: White chooses to place a stone on the top-side making a double pincer, rather than pressing down from R15.  Generally this means white wants to build the top instead of the right.  But why?  D16 is black.  

Another purpose could be if white was very strong in the area, to attack black severely.  But that isn't the case here either.

Of course a final purpose could be to fight for fun and/or confusion.  :)  Personally I have extremely limited experience facing these double pincers.  I have put some variations I found on http://eidogo.com (kogo's) and also Ishida.]

(;B[qd]C[peterchris: what is the best move here for black in this double pincer?

yoyoma: According to kogo's, this is a simplifying variation.  Furthermore generally when double pincered your first thought should be to go out.  See variation.]

;W[mb];B[ob];W[fc]
(;B[hd]C[peterchris: what is the proper pincer to play here?  or not a pincer at all?

yoyoma:  Personally I would not pincer.  Look where the most open area is.  The left side is much wider/open than the top.  It seems hard for white to build the top because of the cut at N17 and the hole at P16.  So the left seems bigger.

Another reason to pincer would be if you can create a weak group to attack.  However N18/O17 is not really a "group", they are kikashi, forcing moves.  They can be discarded if needed.  The other part, white Q15 is strong.

See variation.];W[fe]
(;B[lc]C[Now black abandons the D16 stone.  Almost always black should defend.  Not defending suggests that the benefit from continuing on the top is huge, but that's not the case here.]

(;B[gd]C[peterchris: here I chose to try for influence, rather than to try to kill the group on the edge.  was this correct?

(;B[df]C[peterchris: was it smart to play here?  what is the best way to use this influence?

yoyoma: Ideally you would not want to be forced to add a move to your wall.  The question is:  Is the wall thick?  Or does it lack sufficient eyes?  See the illustration a few moves back.  So is this move slow?  Or is it honte/thick?  I tend to think it could be slow but I'm not sure.]

(;B[di]C[Now I'm getting the feeling that actually you're trying to build points in the middle.  This is not in the correct spirit of using influence.  You should rather push your opponent against it, and make your points somewhere else.  See variation.]
