C[Hello !
First of all, thanks a lot for your time. This is the first time I send a game to the go teaching ladder, I hope I did everything right.
I play black.
As mentionned in the web form, my opponent gave up at the move 69 even if his situation was not desperate. This game was complex to me concerning the direction of play. I had difficulties to decide in which part of the board I had to play.Even if my partner forfeited I have a lot of uncertainties concerning my own moves.]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[dp]C[Okay, I'm mostly going to focus this review on weak groups.  One thing that has helped me a lot is to pay attention to weak groups, whether they are mine or my opponent's.  As you play your next few games, I advise you try to keep thinking about whether or not any groups are weak and what you can do to benefit as a result.

LB[ql:A][nn:B];B[qp]C[I played this move thinking that it was sente. Indeed my opponent responded to it. But is the top left corner more important are to play in ? The top left corner stayed the same during 15 moves. I now believe that it was urgent for me and my opponent to play there sooner, is it right or not ?

[Chew\] - Let's start the discussion about weak groups.  First, your comment shows that you know that your top left group is weak and your bottom right is not.  I feel that strengthening your weak stone is definitely the thing you can do presently that will help you most.  This stone pressures white, but it mostly pressures the single stone instead of the whole group.  If you wanted to pressure the group, I would do A in the previous diagram.  If you wanted to focus entirely on building the bottom, B in the previous diagram would be big.  However, anything in the top left is more urgent, as you guessed.]
;W[qo];B[oo]C[To threat Q5, but I wonder now if it's that big

[Chew\] - Again, small compared to the top left.  Since this only threatens a single stone, white should either ignore it or just defend the rest of her group by jumping up the right side.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[dn];W[dr];B[ho];W[ip];B[hp];W[eo]LB[cm:B]
[cq:A]C[[Chew\] - This stone does not actually threaten much.  You connect at D5, but you could gain more profit by connecting at A or B.  A gives you the most profit, but either one prevents white from pushing and cutting.  White will have forced you to gain profit, not a bad arrangement.]
;B[do];W[cq]LB[cg:B][ck:A][jp:C]C[At this point I did not know what was more important trying to connect the too groups or protect my corner with C4 ?

[Chew\] - Again, we look at weak groups.  Which of your groups are weak?  Really, all but the bottom left.  I will mark a few places you could consider to assist them, depending on your priorities.  I like them in the order of A - B - C.  If your bottom left three stones are not aided, they will become heavy very quickly.  Your top left also needs help a lot, but if worst came to worst, you could sacrifice them.  Your H3-5 stones could become heavy but you have the most strength there, so they need the least help.]
;B[fm]C[[Chew\] - This is reasonable, because it strengthens the correct group,, though it doesn't really link your two bottom left groups.  Since the groups are too far to link safely, I recommend jumping to make a base instead.]
;W[cf]LB[dh:A]C[No it's too late for me to play there. I followed the saying "3 stones around : always tenuki".

[Chew\] - While that stone is not dead, this is reasonable advice.  Regardless, you can use A to threaten to link to it.  Doing this gets you a nice extension from your bottom left, probably in sente.  You built a decent wall in the bottom, you want to extend from it when you can.]
;B[po]C[as P5, it seems that this move does not bring much

[Chew\] - Yeah, capturing one stone feels small.  Again, if you want to threaten the right group, I would play R8 to threaten the whole thing.  As your opponent runs the group out, you can make a solid group on the right.]
;W[ee]C[I guess my opponent really wanted to take my stone out. But is it really necessary ? I believe that trying to run would have strenghten him.

[Chew\] - You did have a lot of aji from that stone, either from the extension I showed you before or from attaching around F16.  However, it is too early for either side to worry about that aji.]
;B[qf]C[[Chew\] - This is good.  The left is still bigger because your group does not have much of a base, but this is a nice, large area.]
;W[pi];B[qc]C[I hesitated a lot. The reason is that I wanted to avoid implications. I admit I played it for the sake of simplicity, even if my initial plan was to target the right side of the board. So, the jump at P14 might have been better than the corner invasion ?

[Chew\] - I would've debated and then probably jumped into the corner or switched directions by playing O17.  If your opponent builds the right, you can build more in the bottom and middle by pressuring it.]
;W[pc]C[My opponent decided to build its wall on this side, it seems relevant as the upper area can be big. Is it right ?

[Chew\] - This feels correct for your opponent.  She has a ton of strength in the top left, so building the wall facing it makes that area really intimidating.]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[pf]C[I wanted to avoid the connection with the Q11 stone, but it appeared to be not that good, because of the harm caused by R15, is it right ?]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rf]
(;C[[Chew\]];B[rg];W[rd];B[sf];W[rc]C[With my partner, we wondered how good was this exchange for white. He secured its corner but I have a ( weak ?) wall to use ? Does it worth it ? Also I had not play R18. But now that I put more thought into this playing R18 is sente and gives me more aji becausethe group has 2 liberties. Is this inference valid ?]
;B[qk]C[I want to attack the R5 R6 stones and in the same time trying to build a base for the R14 group.

[Chew\]  - This is the best move either player has made all game.  It splits two of white's weak groups and lends a little support to your group above, though it does not need much.]
;W[of]
(;B[pm]C[[Chew\] - This is safe and solid but feels smaller than fighting the connection above.]
;W[gn]C[at this point we played around 15 moves in this area. I wonder if the right part of the board was more or less important to play in.

I am also wondering if white should better attack my weak R14 group

[Chew\] - R14 is safe.  If white connects her two groups, you can connect at S11.  If white splits by playing S11, you can cut her stones off with P13.]

;B[cm];W[bo]C[this move made me suffer.];B[bn];W[co];B[cn];W[dk]
;B[ci];W[ke];B[og]C[[Chew\] - Good.  Split your opponent's non-living groups and get access to the center.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[lh]C[Here my oppenent abandonned, I let the discussion in the comment. That's a pity the game ended there, because there could have a been interesting fights.

lebrumar [10k\]: ?
lebrumar [10k\]: you abandonn for what reason ?
awef [9k\]: i don't see anyway to reduce your big territory
lebrumar [10k\]: I think you have more point
lebrumar [10k\]: why not the tengen ?
lebrumar [10k\]: I was very affraid by this move
awef [9k\]: m
awef [9k\]: i didn't see it

[Chew\] Your bottom right was awfully large.  As white, I would have kept fighting with something like K7, but I see how it could be intimidating.  Overall, you played well.  I would just pay attention to stones and be wary of abandoning weak stones like your bottom left.  If your groups are all strong, you always have more options, since you do not have to go back to defend them as easily.  I hope this helped a bit!]
)
(;B[dj]C[[Chew\] - Again, this bottom left group is the weaker of the two.  Playing an extension solves that problem and also denies your opponent an extension from her strong top left.]
))
(;B[og]C[[Chew\] I would respond here.  It keeps white separated and threatens to atari, which would let you push further into white's area.]
))
(;B[rc]C[[Chew\] - Consider this.  It starts a fight for the corner, but prevents the sacrifice of the two stones.  This is an option depending on style and how much you like ko.]
