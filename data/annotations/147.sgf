(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Rob- A note to any reader: This review was done with xgoban, where  variations appear concurrent with the move being varied, rather than on the  move before.  Annoyingly, this makes my comments appear after the variation  appears on every other viewer except for xgoban. Sorry for the hassle, but I  can't get xmgt to work..I have now made an effort to put comments in both  places, but I'm not sure how effective that is..]

[900]KM[0.5];B[dp];W[pc];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]L[pe][jp]C[Rob- This is not a bad move, but I  think that either an approach at q15 (a) or a san-ren-sei (3 star points) at  k4 (b) would be better for you here..]
;W[fq];B[gq]L[hq][iq]M[pp][pj]C[Rob- With the marked stones in place, a pincer is a good idea.  However, the contact play at 7 is not good. A play at h3 (a) or j3 (b) would  be superior.]
;W[fp];B[fo]L[gp][dn]C[Rob-  Keeping in mind that you want to keep your stones connected, a play at  g4  (a) would be better here. If you want to emphasize territory on the left,  perhaps d6 (b).]
;W[dq];B[eq]L[ep][cq]C[Rob- I feel that  e4 (a)  or c3 (b) would be better here. Realize that if w does a, it becomes  severe for you.]
;W[ep]C[Rob- This move puts b in some  pain.];B[er];W[cq];B[cp];W[fr];B
[cr]L[eo][bq][dr][br]C[Rob  - This should probably be e5 (a) . Realize that w could just have done b3 (b)  here, and if you connect at d2 (c) , w does b2 (d) , and your stones are  dead.]

(;W[dr]C[Rob-  Variation 1 plays out the  previous comment.];B[bq];W[es]
;B[gr]L[eo]C[Rob - This move  should be e5 (a), to connect your stones a little better.]
;W[br];B[bo];W[do];B[cn];W[co];B[bp];W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl]C[Rob- Good.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi]C[Rob- At this point you are safely alive.]
;W[ch]L[dl]C[Rob- This  variation shows how the push and cut at d8 (a) might be better for black.]

(;B[bh]L[dl][em][gp]C[Rob- I  think here you should push out at d8 (a) ,  and either cut at e7 (b) or extend up at g4 (c).  See variation 1 for the  push at d8.]
;W[bg];B[cg]C[Rob- This is not  bad, because w has a lot of bad potential (aji).]
;W[bf];B[cf]L[dg][dj][dl]C[Rob - This move must be a. If you do a, you are doing several things:

You give yourself more liberties.  You threaten the cut at b. The push  through at c becomes more dangerous.]
;W[ce];B[dh];W[dg]L[df][ei]C[Rob- This is a bad move by w. It should be at d14 (a),  then w should f11 (b). f11 is the vital point in w's shape.]
;B[df];W[di];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg]M[dh]C[Rob- good,  the marked stone is not important..]
;W[ei];B[de];W[cd];B[ed];W[fe];B[fd]C[Rob- This is good.];W[ge];B[eb]M[de][df][cf][cg]L[ee]C[Rob- You really must connect at e15 (a) now. Your  marked stones could easily end up short of liberties because of the capture  at d13.]
;W[db];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[hc]L[ee]C[Rob- Well, your opponent  played along, but you have to connect at e15 (a) on this move, I think.]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[ee];B[hf];W[gg]C[Rob- This is a strong move by your opponent.]
;B[gf];W[ff]M[fh]L[fh]C[Rob- See variation 1 for way to pull these stones out.]

(;B[gh]L[fh]M[cf][cg][df][de]C[Rob- Actually, if this move is at f12 (a), you  might be able to pull out the marked stones.  See variation 1.]
;W[dg];B[hg];W[ef];B[hd];W[gp];B[hp]L[iq]C[Rob- I think this move must be at j3 (a).]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jq];B[jr];W[lq]L[kq]C[Rob- See variation 1 at l3.]

(;B[kr]L[kq]M[hp]C[Rob- This should be at l3 (a). See variation 1. Because of the  marked stone, w is short of liberties.]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[mr]L[mq]C[Rob- variation 1 at n3 (a). comment next node.]

(;B[js]M[hp]L[mq]C[Rob- n3 (variation 1) is the only move here. I'm  not sure if it works, but it is your best chance. Again, the marked stone  makes the w stones a bit weak.]
;W[ls];B[ns]L[mq]C[Rob- This move does little for you. Again, you should cut at n3 (a).]
;W[nr];B[or];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[oo]L[pn][pe]C[Rob- This might be better at q6 (a), or perhaps even q15 (b).]
;W[op];B[qq];W[pr];B[pq]L[qr]C[Rob-  This move should be r2 (a).];W[po]
;B[os]L[pn]M[pp][pq][qq][oq][or][os][ns]C[Rob- p1  is not good. It just forces w to n1, which w doesn't mind doing, and it  reduces the liberties of the marked stones. I think a better move would be q6  (a) here.]
;W[ms];B[mp]L[pn]C[Rob- This move really doesn't threaten w very much. You must look to  patch up your own weaknesses.. Again, I feel q6 (a) is the proper move.]
;W[no]C[Rob- This is not a very good move by w...];B[on];W[qo];B[mo];W[mq]
;B[mn]L[qm]C[Rob The marked  stones are in some danger. If w gets r7 (a), your corner could clearly die.  So I feel r7 is the right move here.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[nm]L[ol][qm]C[Rob- At this point, your corner is still in some danger, and  w's group really is in no danger. I think the most aggressive you can get  here is p8 (a), and the right move is r7 (b)..]
;B[nl];W[mm];B[mj]L[ol]M[om][on][oo]C[Rob - The cut at p8 (a) is very scary for you  now! The marked stones are very short on liberties.]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[nk]M[om][on][oo]L[pm]C[Rob -  Well, clearly this move should be a, but I think the marked stones would die  anyway.]
;W[pm];B[rp];W[ro];B[qp]L[qr]C[Rob- This is not a good move. If you want to spend a move to  insure your corners survival, then a is the right one.]
;W[sq];B[rr]C[Rob- Good move, I think your corner is definitely alive  now.]
;W[sp];B[sr];W[rs]C[Rob- Bad move by w..];B[qs];W[so]L[oj]C[Rob - see variation 1 at p10 (a). comment upcoming]

(;B[rq]C[Rob- This move isn't necessary. w can't hurt your  corner now.  This is one of the aspects of life and death. Knowing when you  no longer need to spend a move, so you can take the initiative.   You should do variation 1 here.]
;W[pk];B[kn]M[mn][mo][mp]C[Rob- The 3  stones are effectively dead. Attempting to save them here doesn't really  help. Even if you do save them, it doesn't threaten w's group, which is  completely alive, and it doesn't get you much territory.]
;W[km];B[in];W[im];B[kp];W[jo];B[jp];W[io];B[ip];W[ho];B[go];W[ko];B[lp]
;W[ln]L[mc][pe][oj]C[Rob- There really were no good moves to make in that  area...Taking the initiative and doing n17 (a) or q15 (b) would be best.  The  forcing move at p10 (c) first would  be good.]
;B[kc]M[hc][hd][hf][hg]L[mc]C[Rob- Since you have thickness with the marked stones, this extention  can be wider than you've made it. Perhaps to n17 (a).]
;W[mc]L[pe]C[Rob- I think k15 (a) would be best here.];B[le];W[ne];B
[md];W[nd];B[lc];W[me];B[ld];W[mb];B[kg];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[lh];W[mh];B
[ki];W[li];B[kh]L[pe]C[Rob- Now you can see why I recommended q15 (a). While you have  surrounded territory around k15, w has surrounded more territory in the upper  right.]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[ni];B[oj];W[ql];B[nj];W[qj];B[kk];W[jj];B[kj];W[jk]L[qi]
C[Rob - Not such a great move for w. I think r11 (a) would be better  for him.]
;B[ll]M[hp][ip][jp][kp][lp][mp][mo][mn]C[Rob- This doesn't threaten, since your  stones are in atari.]
;W[jl];B[lm];W[lo];B[hj]L[ph]C[Rob- I feel that q12 (a) is your  biggest move.]
;W[hk];B[ji];W[fh];B[gi];W[gg];B[fg];W[he];B[ie];W[fk];B[fj];W[ej];B[gk]

C[Rob- Good! Certainly the largest move.];W[pg];B[oh];W[ng];B[qh];W[qg]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[ri];W[sg];B[rh];W[og];B[rj];W[rk];B[sk]L[lb][ar]C[Rob-  Remember to consider what moves will end with you having sente and which will  end with you having gote. If you want to make a gote move now, m18 (a) is  much bigger. You also have a2 (b) as sente.]
;W[sl];B[sj];W[sh]C[
 phh 26k : is entering byo-yomi];B[qi];W[qk];B[sm];W[rl];B[nh];W[mg]L[ja]
C[Rob- This should be gote for b. w shouldn't respond. k19 (a) is  bigger for w.]
;B[oi]C[Rob- k19 (a) is the right move here.  See variation 1 for how k19, a "monkey jump", plays out.]

(;W[kb]L[ja]C[Rob- k19 (a) is the right move here. See variation 1 for how  k19, a "monkey jump", plays out.]
;B[jb];W[lb];B[ka];W[la];B[ja];W[jc];B[jd];W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[fb];W[ah]
;B[ai]L[bk][ar]C[Rob- A common endgame  pattern. Make sure to pay attention to your liberties. This should be b9 (a)  or a2 (b).]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[aj];B[ar]C[
 nobody 25k*: has entering byo-yomi again

Rob- Good move. This is not small, and it is sente. Moves like a2, where you  keep the person from closing off the corner, are relatively large endgame  moves.]
;W[cs];B[an]C[Rob- Good job, this is the vital point.];W[ml];B[mk];W[kl]
;B[lk];W[eg];B[gg];W[al];B[am];W[bs];B[aq]L[ak]C[Rob- Should capture at  a9 (a), but I can see why you would not want to fight the ko here..]
;W[ak];B[si];W[sf];B[as];W[qd];B[fi]C[Rob- Some final notes:  It's interesting to watch someone who  hasn't played go much get better from the beginning of a game to the end of  the game. I feel you played better as the game went along, and seemed to have  more and more of a feel for better moves.    I would recommend getting some intro go books, and working through a few  joseki, and life and death problems. My favorite introductory book is  "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Kageyama. I found it very helpful.   Obviously continued play is helpful as well. :) Hope this review has been of  some help! Feel free to send me more games if it has.]
