;B[pp]C[This is the first 19x19 game I've played. I'm a complete beginner (30kyu), and would be very appreciative if the major mistakes in my game could be addressed. I've also put comments in at various points for things I was unsure of. Thanks very much! For reference, I'm playing against the 18kyu opponent (well, supposedly 18kyu - I guess it's a lot weaker since I beat it) on 'The Many Faces of Go'.

For the first few moves: I don't know any joseki; could you recommend a couple of good ones for me to study? I've watched a couple of other games and tries to follow similar kinds of moves to what they made in those.

GGM: Hello. My name is Eric, my KGS name is Webweaver; I used to be GoGoMonkey, which is still the name I use for GTL.  I am between 14 and 10 kyu on KGS.  It changes, because I am studying, learing, and just plain play badly sometimes. :)  I have looked over your game and will give you what advice I can.  I am weak at tactics and life and death, so I will avoid any advice unless i am positive that it is good advice.  I don't know any Josiki, other than the first 2 or 3 moves of a couple formations that come up in my games often.  I have been told by many dan playeres that you really don't need to learn Joseki until the single digit kyu ranks, at the earliest, and it is not needed for certain until the dan ranks.  I think this is good advice.  It seems better to concentrate more on playing what comes to your mind on your own, seeing how and when it suceeds, fails, or turns into something you don't understand. Play games on KGS against human opponents since they are start to finish, very good to get practice at a realistic pace. OGS (Online Go Server) is a turn based GO site, giving you days to make a single move.  Very good to allow you time to think and develop deeper reading and strategy.  You played very well, probably due to you observing other games for a while and knowing the rules before playing.  You are well above 30kyu for sure, and the best thing I can tell you above all else is that you have a good grip on the game in general right now,  and the best thing to do is play many, many, more games.  

My email address is taoofsnoopy@gmail.com and I would like your imput about my review.  I have never done one before, so your honest imput would be greatly appreciated.  If you like, I would also like to play some games with you on KGS.  We could do them as even games, not handicapped, and discuss the game as we go.  That is a wonderful way to learn, and would teach you a lot, as well as teaching me about basics in a way I have not yet looked at them, and make me a better teacher as well. 

By the way, I do admit I sound vague and unsure in this review, but that is because you played well and beat a computer opponent by a large amount.  A couple of pointers that they give on the GTL for games that you should submit for review are these.

1.  Submit games with opponents of similar ability or rank, that you either win, or even better, lose, but only by a couple of points  Close games.  This is because you will learn more, since even with mistakes you can beat a much weaker opponent.

2.  Games that you don't understand what happened, in part or as a whole.  I usually know why I beat a weaker opponent, and often know why I win or lose a very close game against an even opponent.  I play a 12 kyu, lose by 12 points, and if I lost a group of 6 stones due to a mistake I know I made, I know why I lost.  It's the games where you lose and have no clear vision of any major mistakes on your part or your opponent that give you the best opportuninty to learn; not what you or they did wrong, but how you can get better overall.

3. Human Opponents.  They make mistakes that make sence.  I know that sounds funny, but it's true.  Computers make mistakes because they can only follow their A.I. programming and don't know any better.  :)

So, you played well, and I have trouble giving you advice when you did so well.  It's hard to say, "Hey, these moves were wrong, but you still won by 60 points."  Well, wrong or not, how wrong could they be if you won, right?  So, I will do my best, and please forgive my vagueness.

OK. Here we go.....:)];W[dc];B[qd];W[cq];B[qj]TR[oc][ce][ee]
C[One of the opening principles is corners, sides,center, in that order.  What that means is to make the corners balanced first, balanced meaning even in territory or power, then extend out along the sides, and then finally move out into the center,.  There is nothing wrong with your move, mind you, but it is extremelly defensive at this point.  C15 or E15 would be more balanced and keep you on the offensive, and P17 would be defensive but it settles your upper right corner, making it settled for now.  Just minor, mind you, as the opening is vague at best at our level.  I also point this out due to your position a couple moves later....]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[kp];B[oc];W[jc]C[GGM - Ok.  Right here is where I did see an opening problem.  White has played loosely, and you have played your stones closer together, making a stronger position.  Both of these are fine in their own right, but there is a problem.  From column O all the way left, is White.  From column P all the way right, is black.  Even though white is loose, white covers 3/4 of the board, where you have 1/4.  This could mean you will fight an uphill battle from this point.  Move # 10 is too early to be in such a struggle.]
;B[ce]C[GGM - ...and you do good by breaking out and attacking white's corner.]
;W[gd];B[ch];W[cl];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd]TR[bd]C[GGM - I would do B16, just because D16 makes this very, very complicated, and I am not good enough at corner tactics to feel any confidence in such a fight.]
;W[bd];B[de]TR[cc]C[I think I lose the triangle stone if my opponent goes to C18, but he chooses not to. If he plays C18 on move 20, how should I react?

GGM - You do indeed lose said stone if white plays C18, and I don't think you can save it, even now, which is why white doesn't play it, it's most likely dead and you have no good way to react, so white plays elsewhere.  Make sense?]
;W[ec];B[bc];W[cj];B[bj]C[I think this was a mistake; white can kill this stone by playing at B11, I think?

GGM - I think your right, it's probably dead.  If not, you would waste too many moves saving it, with not a lot of territorial gain for your effort.  I would probably consider E12, D5, or G4.  They would probably be better than a 2nd line move that is weak.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[mc];B[mb]TR[oj]C[Is this stone dead as soon as I place it if my opponent plays O18?

GGM - Same as the left side, if it's not dead, it still would not be worth saving.  P10 instead makes you a wonderful box shaped moyo on the right side.  Moyo, if you don't know, means a loose outlne of stones that could possibly become your territory, a rough outline if you will.]
;W[ql];B[qg];W[bi];B[ci];W[dj]C[GGM - ???   I get why white would do this, but.....]
;B[bh];W[ai]C[GGM - It is beyond me why white wasted this move.  B11 is dead as it stood, yet white wastes a move, not even saving it's already dead stone, and it's not even a sacrifice trick or a move that gains white sente.  

Well, it is a computer playing, that's about all I can say.

Sente is like initiative, you play a move that the opponent answers, it is sente.  I can't explain it very well, but you should look it up, it is very important.]
;B[aj];W[on];B[fq];W[hq];B[gr]TR[fo][dp]C[GGM - F3 was fine, could be F4, but I would then probably jump out to F5 first, due to the confined space you invaded, but i would say your move is probably playable, not a complete disaster.  Mmm.  D4 looks even better.]
;W[hr];B[dq];W[cp];B[cr];W[dr]C[GGM - ??? Again, it's either a strategy I don't know, or the computer is just plain dumb.]
;B[er];W[ds]C[GGM - Well, you did win.  So I say dumb. :)];B[cs]
;W[cn];B[of];W[dp];B[es];W[be];B[bf];W[bq];B[br]C[This gives me an empty triangle shape which I know is bad - what should I play instead of 55?]
;W[mn];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[la];B[ka];W[nb];B[ma];W[nc]
(;B[md]C[GGM - Ok, looking at the future moves, I think this was a mistake. Very simply, I think I would have just simply extended to M16, it puts you ahead, and if white decides to push from behind with N16 and you go down again with M15, you are forcind the white stones on the right to travel through you with black on either side, and you also start building a nice wall  

See my variation last move...];W[nd];B[me];W[od];B[pc];W[ld]
;B[kd];W[le];B[lf]C[I was considering a ladder with 73 but then realised that if I kept the ladder going down to white's stones, I'd have a lot of points where white could give me a double atari - not good! Unfortunately I've already messed up a little here thanks to white being able to play move 76 on L17 or N14 (whichever I don't play on).]
;W[ke];B[mf];W[kc];B[lb];W[jd];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia]C[I think the stones at the top here are dead?

GGM - I belive they are, and white just playes this stupid, from what I can tell.]
;W[ha];B[hb]C[Is this a silly move? It seemed good at the time, but I'm not 100% sure it works.

GGM - See move 91.];W[ja];B[ic];W[hc];B[ia];W[gb];B[ga];W[id]
;B[ib]C[GGM - Well, I'm not sure if you played smart, white played stupid, or both.  Then again, you saved your group and made two eyes, so you did something right.]
;W[ar];B[fb]TR[fj][oj][fo]C[GGM - Kind of a weak move, not very severe.  White has a good amount of power now facing the center, which in the hands of a good player, could give you problems, and this move doesn't give you much on the edge, it isn't a life saving move or a big territory move.  Just a few possibilities for alternatives are F5, F10, or P10.  I'd probably do F10.]
;W[fc];B[gc];W[hd];B[gb];W[fe];B[jg];W[bk];B[ah];W[ak];B[hf]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[ff];B[ok];W[fi];B[gh];W[fh];B[hh]TR[gg][hg]C[Does this bamboo joint serve any purpose here? I know it's good shape, and that's why I made it. I know roughly what a good shape entails, but when should (and shouldn't) I be concerned about shape?

GGM - Looks fine to me.  And seriously, you will finally understand shape at 9 dan.  And even then, you worry about it all the time.  It's like life and death.  No, I am not joking, it's sad, funny, and true all at the same time.  Shape is a subject that becomes very obscure and abstract, far beyond us mere kyu's.   

The Bamboo Joint is good for the fact that it can be connected easily.  If white playes either G13 or H13, black plays the other one and stays connected.  I might be wrong, but I believe that this is best for defensive purposes, in that you can use it to help a group 'escape' from a tight spot when it's under attack and short on space to run.]

;W[nh];B[mh]TR[ok][ol][pl]C[Not entirely sure - just noticed this; are the stones I've marked triangle here dead via some kind of net combination perhaps?

GGM - I couldn't tell you if they are dead for sure, but they are in serious trouble.  Given your strong positions in other parts of the board, I would play elsewhere and probably let them die since saving them would take a lot of effort that would probably help out white in the end anyway.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[kg];B[kf];W[pm];B[ml]
;W[mk];B[nl]C[I'm trying to save them - pretty sure they're dead now, but not 100% sure.]
;W[ll]C[After move 156 I let white have those stones.];B[ed]
;W[fd];B[di];W[og];B[pg];W[pf];B[jf]C[Is move 163 necessary here? I felt I could now kill the white group around O10 now if my opponent wasn't careful, but I didn't want my black group to get killed first, hence the join in move 163!

GGM - I think you did right, as all it would take is a white stone at K14 to cut off your black group, and that same black group is important because it let's you kill whit'es stones in the upper right corner.  In other words. if you saving that black group allows white to save it's group just below it, fine, since you are saving your's, killing another white group instead, and securing the ENTIRE upper right corner.  You are way ahead this way.]
;W[eb];B[lk]C[Now I try to kill the white group.

GGM - And you suceed.];W[kk];B[lj];W[km];B[mj];W[ej];B[fl];W[fk]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[fm];W[gm];B[gn];W[fn]C[Are F7/F8 dead here? If not, how can I save them?]
;B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[dn];B[jk]C[My thoughts for move 183 were to do a ladder attack starting with H7. I think that works thanks to my stone 183?

The computer resigned here, much to my surprise! It said I was up by 85.5 points somehow... If only the computer's supposed rating on 18kyu was realistic! :)

Thanks very much for the review, I appreciate your time! Any other feedback alongside the comments I've made would be much appreciated.

-Simba

GGM - Well, you did well.  What else can I say?  Your better than 30, and yeah, the computer did not seem to live up to 18 kyu.  Keep playing and studying, your doing fine.  Oh yeah, one last thing.  Watch the offensive moves on the second line.  They can be very effective, but you made them sometimes when they were not very effective, Make sure they are severe if you make them, and watch the timing. 2nd line moves are usually an attempt to destroy your opponent's possible eye space,  so make sure there is a killable or at least containable group to attack.

And remember, my advice, just like any other go advice you will ever get, is never true 100% of the time.  The only black and white thing in go is the stones.  :)]

(;B[ld];W[md];B[le]C[GGM - See, I like this much better. Simple, I know, but it feels stronger, don't you think?]
