;B[hp]LB[pp:A][dp:B]MA[jp][jq][kq][iq][fq]C[I don't like this move. It is too far away from A to work as an effective extension. It is also too far away from B to put preasure on white. I have trouble to find a good follow up move. I think one of the marked positions would be better.]
;W[dm];B[jd];W[fc]MA[ed][ec]C[Good! builds towards a large area on the left side. I have marked a two other good positions]
;B[eg]LB[cg:A]MA[jd]C[Correct idea (reduce wite's left), but I don't thik this will work veery well. white should now extend below to A to steal black's base and then try to separate it from the marked stone. Black will probably live, but white will get very strong in the process.]
