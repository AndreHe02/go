C[Hi

My name is Saurus, and I will mark my comments with an "S"
I am 7 kyu on KGS, and I hope you will find my comments useful.

I have been asked to review the game for black, and I have therefore restricted my review to the black moves.

I have indicated wherever I have given variations.
The main themes that need improvement are given in my general comments on the last move.

Enjoy the review!    :)


this is a match between me f4223n354 (12k/B) and drakonian (11k/W) in KGS at 17 oct 09
i'm losing this match by 37,5 point
i thing my biggest mistake is putting a wrong ko thread, well it's not a threat anyway...T_T
put it aside, i want to know if i can do any better
so please review my game
thanks];B[pp]C[S: It has become customary in internet games to start in the top right corner.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pc];B[pe]C[S: Good - preventing a corner enclosure is huge.]
;W[jq]
(;B[nc]C[S: I think that if you allow your groups to be separated, it becomes difficult to defend both groups and keep the initiative. I prefer b-o16. (See variation)]
;W[od]
(;B[fc]C[S: You have chosen a joseki where your stones have been cut. It is vital that you make them safe before leaving the area. (See variation)]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[jd]C[S: You cannot play b-k16 after the exchange of b-d18, w-c17. The white group is strong and can invade later at h17. B-j17 is the only move after the exchange.

If you wish to play b-k16, then omit the b-d18, w-c17 exchange. This way, if white invades at h17, you will be able to play 3-3 at b-c17, and you're OK.]
;W[cn]
(;B[gq]C[S: With two white stones in the area, this is a little too light. B-f3 or b-d6 is better. I prefer b-d6. (See variation)]
;W[ck]
(;B[ch]C[S: This is a huge mistake.

You have placed a black stone right in the middle of two strong white groups. The result is that c12 is not really an invading stone, but is itself a target. 

Now, white can chase the c12 stone around the board, and in doing so, will build up large influence around the f8 area.
 
Strategically, making your own moyo is as good as preventing an opponent's moyo. Therefore, in this situation, it would have been MUCH better to make your own moyo with b-m3, rather than giving white a target to attack.
 
IMPORTANT: You should only ever invade if the invading stone is equal or stronger than one of the opponent's groups to the sides of your invading stone (unless you are behind late in the game, and a desperate invasion is called for.) 

B-c12 has nothing to attack, even if you get a second stone at b-e12.

(See two variations)];W[mq]C[White gets to fix his weakness.]

(;B[pj]C[S: White has a strong group close to your q4 stone. 

You need to play safe with b-q6 or b-r6.];W[qm]
(;B[qd]C[S: Q4 is in trouble. A play around q4 is urgent.

(;B[ld]C[S: Contact moves only make your opponent stronger. B-m17 was much better.]
;W[lf]
(;B[eh]C[S: B-12 is gote, since it has no effect on your opponent.

Keep sente by approaching your opponents weak groups, for example, b-r5.

(See variation)];W[bp];B[cq];W[en]
(;B[ho]C[S: Avoid playing moves which have no effect on your opponent.

Better moves:
- B-k14 threatens the white group and is sente.
- B-r5 is equally good.

You are already far ahead. You don't need to try and kill everything.
Simply play safe and win.

B-q6 was simple, safe and strong.];W[ro]
(;B[pn]C[S: Empty triangle - horrible shape!

White will be able to expoit this shape and strengthen all his own stones in the process.

Simply capture at b-r1.

(;B[on]C[S: Trying to kill the white group now is very greedy. 

You're ahead by about 30 points. Trying to pick fights when you have such a big lead is crazy. Simply fix your weaknesses and win comfortably.

For example, even playing b-L16 now puts you about 50 points ahead.]

is there any better move?

S: You should never have started this fight in the first place. The entire sequence from 69 to 77 was bad. With all the white aji in the area, there was no way you could win this fight.]

;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[ed];W[de];B[df];W[di];B[ee]C[S: Good - this wall is very strong, and you should profit from it in a big way.]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[iq]
(;B[lq]C[S: This was a big mistake:

1) Strategically, the correct group to attack is the weak top right group, since you have invested a number of moves building your wall.

2) White is strong in the area - m3 is itself a target, not an invading stone.

3) Attacking a group with a contact move will always fail. There are very few exceptions. You should take it as a rule of thumb that any contact move used for attack will fail.

4) The g3 group is not yet settled. Allowing white to increase strength in this area will only harm your position.

You should be aiming at making profit from your wall. B-L16 here is huge!

(See variation)];W[mr];B[ps];W[mi]C[S: White has finally equalized.]

(;B[jj]C[i myself not sure about this move but somewhere in my head tells me it's good...XP

S: I disagree.

The center is open from the top and the bottom for black, and from the left and the right for white. This means that there is no real territory to be made in the center. Also, it does not prevent your opponent from making territory, since he could probably not do so anyway.

Better to continue to profit from your wall by attacking the white group in sente, and then closing your own territory.

More importantly, it has no effect on your opponent's groups, and white does not have to respond.

(;B[jf]C[S: Another contact move which only strengthens your opponent.

B-L16 is better.];W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[hf];W[gi];B[mj]C[S: Trying to cut your opponent's groups apart here is good strategy.]
;W[lj]
(;B[nj]C[S: Too small.

Perhaps this would be a good time to fix your bottom left group.

(See variation)];W[hm];B[kg];W[kh];B[lg];W[kf];B[mg];W[ng]
(;B[nf]C[S: Wrong side - you should always attack from the outside, unless you can read out an exact sequence to kill.

(See variation)];W[nh]C[S: White now cuts your groups apart.]

(;B[ne]C[S: B-n15 is safer, and takes away a liberty from white's empty triangle.

B-o15 allows hane at the head of two stones (bad shape) which is one of the reasons you ran into problems here.

(See variation)];W[nd];B[md];W[pg];B[oh];W[qg]
(;B[qf]C[S: Ouch! Empty triangle actually removes your own liberties.

See variation of how to kill and connect.

(;B[ki]C[S: This is the losing move. B-k12 would have saved the game.
The fact that it is a contact move should have forced you to look for other alternatives. Never play contact moves without reading them out!

S: There are a few general things you should focus on if you wish to improve:

Most important:

1) Avoid contact moves when attacking. This alone will move you well into the single digit kyus.
This has been your main downfall throughout the game. Examples of bad contact moves are found at moves 29, 95, 101 and 173.

2) Avoid move which have no effect on your opponent, especially early in the game. Examples of these are moves 17, 35 and 99.


Less important, but still need attention:

3) When you are ahead, play moves that solidify your own groups rather than attacking.

4) In the opening, play slightly more solid moves if your opponent's stones are present in the area.


Good luck with your journey into the single digit kyus.    :)
