C[This is a game played on the internet. 20 minutes does not seem much time, but Byo-Yomi was 20 moves in 20 minutes.

I play black in the game

In the end I did win the game but I thought my opponent played some non-realistic moves but still he kept in the game. So I must have played a few bad moves as well.

What were mine bad moves ?


Empiror: it's better to have your lost game reviewed rather than the won ones. it's about modesty and apparent benefits for your improvment.  I'd recommend gtl to make it an official suggestion to all learners who submits their games for full review.]
;B[qf]C[First move is here, I just try to avoid standard openings (one do not learn much from that.]

;W[gq];B[io]C[Is this move okay ? It is a slack move but I did not like white playing M3 weaking my group.
I also like to think that this move keeps some pressure on the wite corner (e.g. the possibility to play F3).

Is there a better play?

Emp: a solid move to prevent L3, often seen in pro games. when C3 is open, F3 is no big deal.

alternatives are C6, P17 , not necessarily better moves though.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[Emp: usually, when there isn't a white stone at Q12, b doesn't want to play G17. G17 usually means you want to settle down ASAP. consider b has got one more stones locally, i.e. b is in attacking position, you don't attack by playing so close with your opponent's stone.]

(;W[qd];B[pd];W[pe];B[od];W[rc]C[Emp: wrong sequence by white.]

(;B[qb];W[qe];B[nc]C[Emp: bad move, close to useless, R18 is a must, it's huge.]
;W[rb];B[oe]C[Is this aji-keshi ?
I wanted to expand my moyo and seen S18 I do not have a attack left on the white group.

Emp: bad move, it paralyzes Q14 while getting nothing. what moyo? the upper side is wide open, can't be called  a moyo.]
;W[pf];B[cn];W[cl]C[I did not expect this move. I expected white to defend his corner, and I could play around C10.
But is this a bad move ??

Emp: not a bad move at all. w can't defend C3 and F3 in one move, so w doesn't, good defence is offence now for w.]

(;B[bp]C[Is there a stronger way to attack the white group ??

Emp: bad move. previous A,B,C are better];W[cq];B[bq];W[br]

(;B[ef]C[Seems a bit slack, but I did not like just defending the corner
Is K16 an option ?

Emp: very normal move. K16 not an option.]

;W[hn];B[gl];W[hm]C[I expected white to connect at H5

Emp: H7 is a good attack.];B[fl];W[gi];B[hl];W[jm];B[ho]C[Emp: not so powerful cut, because b's group is under attack.]
;W[il];B[hj];W[lq];B[lp]C[Did not like to play here but I do not think O2 works, white L5.

Emp: b is the underdog here. even M2 is pretty risky fight. bad result for b , but the cause occurs many moves ago.]

;B[nr];W[hq]C[Emp: b should feel lucky and happy for the result.]
;B[kn]C[I did not date to play N7, too much complications, with this move black has one eye.
Is N7 better ?

Emp: this move better than N7. because w's J5 can make b's shape broken.]

G16 better ??];W[fc]C[This is why I should not have played R7]

White G17 would also create a living white group.

But still is M11 better. Also because B6 removes the eye from black and I suddenly have a drifting group.]

I count:
Black 71 points
White 65 points
Is this correct ?

Emp: the difference is bigger.

b and w are at the same level. both should work on understanding basic joseki moves, life&death and fighting skills. both players play in  very 'kind' style, can be very vulenrable when playing with 'bloodthristy' players.
