[fd:13][gd:12][pd:1][fe:9][je:14][cf:6][jg:A][dp:4][pp:3]C[White 16 seems like the first genuine mistake to me.  White 12 was played with the intention of making black heavy, or should have been; its purpose accomplished, it's light.  15 Is just an attempt to swallow a light stone, which is useless.  Let him have it, if he wants it so bad; take the opportunity to jump at A, perhaps.]

(;W[ld]C[This is a local move, and not a particularly inspiring one.  If you're worried about the strength of these stones (and with the black group on the top left settled and the upper right getting thick, you should be), you can just jump out.]
;B[lc];W[le];B[md];W[ig]C[Through this point, white has helped black to settle (the top left group is alive), and to become thick (the top right is solid black territory at this point).  Compare the variations.]
;B[gg];W[lg];B[ng];W[qc]TR[lb][mc][md][me][ng]C[This is painful!  When the opponent has a strong presence in the area (the marked wall) you can't consider it equivalent to an invasion in an otherwise unprotected area (as at R3).]

(;W[lq]TR[lp][hq]C[This move feels very wrong.  The shape is ugly, and it doesn't do much to maintain the connection between the marked stones. I would be tempted to play N2, to separate the black groups, but a running fight is not much of an option because white will be running directly into an overwhelming black presence.  Perhaps white cannot resist that strongly at this point -- in which case the more passive response is necessary.]

;B[nk];W[mi];B[eq];W[pk];B[oj];W[og];B[oh]C[White focuses on local life and points too much in the early game, and as a result helps black to build strong, thick positions which leave no room for attack.  In addition, white played a game of paranoia, seeing black building something and panicking, followed by very local action.  As part of improvement, you will begin to see more "globally," aiming at foiling your opponent's plans *while enacting your own*.  Furthermore, I get the sense that you got emotionally attached to the game, and that's never a path to success.

Black plays some odd moves, but his sense of direction is not taxed in this game because he keeps white in a pattern of reaction throughout the game.

I hope you enjoyed the review!

This is why thickness can be more valuable than territory:  a strong position can force your opponent to take suboptimal paths in later fights because otherwise you can crush them against it.]
