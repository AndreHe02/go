;B[dd];W[fd];B[ld];W[qc]L[of][pg]C[reid: normally white jumps out with a (p14) or
b (q13). playing r17 leads to a cramped position.];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[mc]
;B[lc];W[ic];B[fc];W[gc];B[ec];W[gd];B[df]C[reid: at this point,  the black groups at d16 and r16 are
ideal - very strong, difficult to attack.  the g16 and
p16 white groups are weak by comparison.  that makes the
black m16 group a perfect splitting attack.  that should
be the strategic focus (for both sides) for the next few
moves.];W[rb]C[reid: s18 is gote for white, and should be left for the  endgame,
or until white really needs eye space (because he's surrounded).
better to jump out with something around a (p14).];B[sb];W[ra];B[qo]L[mb]
[nc][nb][kb]C[reid:  black misses a chance to do some serious damage
here.  again, the focus should be the splitting attack
using the m16 group.  how about the hane at a - n18, see if
you can get the right white group down to one eye?  white
answers either by pulling back with b - o17 (black follows
with c - o18) or with the hane at c - o18 (black connects
at d - l18).  either way, black is much stronger and
white is weaker.];W[pf]C[reid: white takes advantage of  black's slip.]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[md]C[reid: black is in a  tough spot here (due to r5),
but continuing out on the right (around a - r11)
is more urgent.]
(;W[nc]C[reid: now white misses a chance. see variation.];B[jd];W[kb];B
[lb]L[hg]C[reid: for white to exchange l18 for m18 is
a great loss. now the gote sequence at s18
and s19 become meaningless.  probably better
for white to come out around a - h13.];W[kc];B[kd]C[reid: white is  helping black to get nice and thick here.]
;W[hf];B[kg];W[mg]L[qi]C[reid: this move  doesn't seem to have much
affect on black.  it doesn't threaten to cut
or surround the black stones.  it isn't
necessary for protecting p15 either (since
the ladder works for white).  again, pushing
down with a (r11) seems like the move for white.];B[jh]L[pi]C[reid:  since n13 wasn't a threat, there is no
need to answer it right away.  better to hane
at a - q11.  the left side white group can live
easily with h18, so there is no fight left in
this area.];W[hh];B[qi];W[jj]L[ij]C[reid: since white has no  real hope of killing
this black group, it might be better to hold
back a bit and play a - j10 instead.  that way
he doesn't leave a hole behind, and it works
better with the stone at d4.];B[li];W[oj];B[ii]C[reid: black squeezes through  the hole.]
;W[hi]C[reid: white can do a better job of encirclement
by holding back with a - g10 instead (although
it's still not good enough to kill black).];B[ij]C[reid: squeezing through  like this is a
dagger in white's heart!];W[qk]L[pk][ol][ch]C[reid: this looks like an overplay.  black
can cut off ths stone, and it ends up in
black's sphere of influence.  if white wants
play in this area, he needs to hold back with
a - q9 or b - p8.  but this area doesn't have
much affect on black, so it's probably better
to change strategy and go to c - c12.];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[qm]
;B[oi]L[rn]C[reid: is p11 really necessary now?  how
about a - s6 to de-stablize white?];W[pi]L[qj]C[reid: better to not play  here - white may decide
later that he needs a - r10 for the life of his
r9 group...];B[qj];W[nj];B[nl]L[mk][mj]C[reid:  personally, i really like to find  moves with
more than one purpose.  how about playing at a - n9
here instead?  it threatens to catch the o10 stones
(black o11 makes a geta) and it also helps to surround
the r9 stones.  the sahpe that black is left with after
this move is not ideal, since there's a hole at b - n10.];W[ni];B[om];W
[rj];B[pl]L[ri]C[reid: hmmm. much safer to block at a - s11
here. then black is alive, and white still has
the burden of trying to get life.];W[ri]C[reid:  now it's going to be a  semeai (race
to capture).  if black wants to play this
way, he really needs to read out the whole
fight (with all possible variations) beforehand.
otherwise, it's better to play safe (with s11
instead of q8).];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[rg]C[reid:  ouch!!];B[ip]C[reid:   before this loss, black was perhaps
15 points ahead.  now the game is pretty close...];W[kq]C[reid:  a basic  strategic principle is to not
fight where you must fight at a disadvantage
(see Sun Tzu: "The Art of War" for example)
white has played a stone right in the middle
of black's sphere of influence.  he should
therefor suffer a strategic loss.  better to
play around a - c12 or b - g3 and try to build
a comparable moyo...];B[jq];W[kp]C[reid:  this is a bit heavy for white.   perhaps
he should try a probe at q2?];B[mq]C[reid:  severe!  good move :-)];W[kn]
L[io]C[reid:  i think white needs to try something
a bit more drastic here.  like perhaps the
contact play at a j5.  see how black answers,
and be prepared to sacrifice the l3 stones.];B[in]C[reid:  good  continuation.]
;W[kl];B[il];W[lj];B[mj];W[mi];B[mk];W[ki];B[lh];W[kh];B[lk];W[kj];B[kk]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[lg];B[ik];W[mh];B[jf]C[reid: nice sacrifice for  black there :-)
black is ahead again.];W[gq];B[cn]L[hq]C[reid:  i think i'd answer g3  (with a - h3)
after all, black has made a huge investment
in the lower right corner, it's not something
black wants to take nay risks losing.  and
there is no one move by white that can
compensate for making that lower right
corner 100% secure...];W[cp];B[ck];W[ch]C[reid:  white has to try this...  hoping
for a black blunder :-)];B[cg];W[dh];B[bg];W[dl];B[cl];W[dm];B[dn];W[cm]
;B[bm]C[
 qifu 6k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[bo];B[bn];W[fm];B[bh];W[bi];B[ci]C[reid: simply  connecting with a - b10
secures black's win.];W[cj];B[di]L[bj]C[reid: oops! black could still  play a - b10
instead of d11.];W[dj]
(;B[ei]C[reid:  i think black has lost sight of the
important (strategic) issues.  the d11 stones
are not very important, but the c8 stones are!
how about the variation?];W[dk];B[bk];W[bj];B[al];W[an];B[en];W[gn];B[em]

;W[lo];B[nq]C[reid:  you should almost always take
the ko at least the first time (before
filling).  you can make him use up
one ko threat...];W[mn];B[no];W[jp];B[iq];W[jo];B[io];W[ms];B[kr];W[ig]

(;B[dq]C[reid: cutting isn't always the best solution :-)
see variation...];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[fs];W[er];B[es];W[ds]
;B[ej]C[reid:  what's this move for?  seems to be 1 1/2
points in gote :-(];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[rm]C[
 qifu 6k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[gb]C[reid:  big!  now black can't hope to
cut through g15-h15, so e10 is really
wasted now...];B[gg];W[hg]C[reid: white could answer this at j12 too.];B
[hj];W[fi];B[gh];W[gi];B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[jc];W[fh];B
[ff]C[reid: bad shape.  better is e13...];W[eg]C[reid: black can save the four  stones,
but he will lose the two e17 stones.
if black had played e13 instead of
f14, the black stones would be safe,
and white would have to worry about
black j18.  the entire group has only
one gote eye (a black move at h7 takes
away this eye).])
(;B[bq]C[how about here?];W[cq];B[cr];W[bp];B[er];W[br];B[bs];W[aq];B[fr]
;W[ao];B[dq]C[the game looks close at this  point,
but i think black has a slight lead.
if blacks isn't confidant, he could
try starting the ko at a2 instead of
cutting at d3.]))
(;W[tt]M[dk]C[this looks like a good way  to settle the situation...];B
[dk]L[ei][ej][ek][bk]C[it looks like white has  several choices (a
b or c spring to mind) but it looks like black
can handle things quite easily no matter what.
if white a, black can jump to f9.  if white b,
black c threatens to catch three white stones.
if white c, black a (atari) followed by black
e8 gives a double atari.  if white d, black just
connects at b5 and white must still resort to
a, b or c (but black threatens to connect under
with a9).]))
(;W[qi]M[nc]C[reid: instead of o17, how about if white plays like  this?]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qj];W[pi];B[rh];W[nc]L[kg][qk]C[now black has two problems: the m16 stones look
very weak - if white gets to move somewhere around
a - l13 it looks like they might die.  but taking
r10 in the ladder (with white b - r9) gives white
a powerful board position.]))
