C[This game was played on KGS, and according to them, I, Endymion, was 25 kyu and my opponent, crux, was 21 kyu at the time.
( I played as black, but without handicaps because I want my ranking to go up faster, and because it's more challenging )

It is a good idea just remember to play on even  people who are not too much stronger (I think up to 3 stones)]

(;W[pg]C[I think if white went at R15 here instead of Q13, i may have been in a bit of trouble.

Yes ! after you connect he would probably extend to r16 - big los for balck]

;B[cl];W[pm];B[co];W[bo];B[pl];W[rf]C[This ko threat is too small.  Black should ignore it and capture.]
;B[re];W[pm];B[cp];W[bp];B[pl];W[op];B[pp];W[pm];B[de]C[I realized -after- i put this stone down that this may not have been quite a strong enough ko threat.  Was there a better one for me, or was the ko lost after all?

Maybe c3 .. but only a maybe. YTou should have ended the ko fight before that]
;W[qn];B[ce]C[Hmm... in the end I did have pretty substancial influence in the top left, although i pretty much lost the bottom right.

The question to ask yourslef befor making move like c15 is quite simple:
Do I gain more than I lose ?

Here you will CERTAINLY lose lots of corner teritory. And probably will gain some at the top. But before you lost the ko fight you were winning so you were not the one to take risks...]

;B[og];W[of]C[Ah, the flaw in my plans to overtake his white group.  I decided to -attempt- to save my R10 group after my plans were foiled.

Takes a bit of reading but it was not savable.  If you have a dead group use it as:
1) source of ko threats
2) threaten to pull it from outsie - you get to make free palys (if possible of coruse)]
;B[rl];W[sl]C[another wasted ko threat];B[sk];W[sm]C[emphasis on "attempt" ...]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[so];B[rn];W[qm];B[sp];W[rk];B[ib]C[this move was me basically giving up on the bottom right.  probably not  good idea, though it helped my situation on top.  I'm not sure which was better.

to begin with I am not so sure c16 is dead. c17 might cause trouble

what about s3 ? it ia also worth some points...

as far as lower side goes f5 looks promising..];W[rq];B[rp]

;W[ii];B[gi]C[BIG mistake. Now giving up those 4 stones was not a los for white but gain.  He will connect at c14 in SENTE (threatening b15)]
;W[cf];B[bd];W[bi]C[now count points. you gained: 4 + 3 = 7 points.   how much will white take away?]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[bf];W[bg];B[hf];W[hg];B[id];W[jc]C[l17 white k18 white l8  - and black gives up one stone (j18) instead of allowin monkey jump]
;B[jb];W[kc]C[wrong direction . you are pushing him into you r own territory]
;B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[nb]C[late. should have stopped him sooner. what will you do if he tries P17 at some point?]

C[e2 better but black still dead];W[dr]C[another failed plan.  i wanted that E4 group or the J3 group]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[mo];W[mp];B[kq]C[here i wanted the O4 group but i thought too quickly and didn't notice the obvious mistake i made.

not possible to kill o4];W[kr];B[am];W[an];B[al];W[ci];B[dh]

;W[ag];B[ak];W[km];B[jg]C[around here each move took about five minutes of thought because I wanted there to be -some way- of taking one of his three huge groups on the top.  I came close a few times, but each time i was one move off.]
;W[kf];B[mg];W[ng];B[mf];W[lg];B[ee];W[lm];B[hn];W[ln]C[this is where i got lucky in the bottom right.  this cut at M6 caught me by surprise because i wasn't paying much attention down there, i was focused on the top.]
;B[sn];W[pl];B[nl]C[However, I got two eyes =)

you had them :)];W[nk];B[fb]C[this was a trick move to make him think i was playing defensively.  Of course, it didn't work.

It never does :)
At least dont count on it ... :)))];W[ll];B[he];W[sq];B[ji]
;W[jh];B[ij];W[kg];B[ih]C[Little did i realize I just gave him two eyes because of A11 and A12]
;W[ki];B[ii]C[at least i did a little damage to his territory]
;W[ik];B[kj]C[I thought I had him here, i was going after the top middle group]
;W[jj];B[li];W[kh];B[mh]C[All I need is M12 and I've got him!]

(;W[lj]C[ARGH! ... I didn't see that one coming.  M10 killed my whole plan, so I passed and he won by 31.5 points.]
;C[I could've made one more point at J5 but I didn't really care once my huge viscious plan was poked in the eye with a sharp stick.

Anyway, that's my game, I await both your enlightening feedback and a rematch with great anticipation =)
Thank you very much for your time.])
