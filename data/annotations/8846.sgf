C[reid: Hello emerus.  Let's start off nice and early.  This pincer seems natural, but let's take a look at the whole board.  Black has Q16 and C4 in place thanks to handicap.  Since they're high, black want's to build a moyo based on them.

This pincer causes white to run out to the center, and each white move affect both the right side and the bottom.  Black can't expect to build both sides.  I think black would be better off maintaining his positional advantage with something like A, B (if he doesn't mind the push-and-cut josekis) or C or D.]
;W[po];B[om];W[np];B[mq]LB[qf:A][jp:B]C[reid: this is a joseki, but again, black should be thinking about the big picture and let white take this one stone if he really wants it.  A, for example, or somewhere around B perhaps.  I prefer A because it's difficult to defend two large areas.  Better to focus on one moyo.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp]C[reid: All these exchanges are good for white.  Black is pushing from behind, always a bad thing.  White will be able to use this power to attack the R-7 stones - similar to a splitting attack.]
;B[iq];W[mp]
(;B[qj]LB[qg:A]C[reid: This is too close.  The proverb says "play away from strength".  The two black stones are weakened by the bottom right joseki, but they're not exactly weak.  A would be better.  If white tries to invade between A and R-7/P-7, black will have a huge advantage.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[jq];B[jr];W[ir];B[ks];W[hq];B[pr];W[ip];B[cn]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[dj]LB[pb:C][pc:B][ed:D][fd:E][cj:A]C[reid: Moves on the fourth line are for building moyos.  The white stones at J-4 are very powerful towards the center, so black shouldn't expect to make a moyo now.  A would be better.  B or C might also be interesting.  If white responds around A, black can invade at D or E.]

;W[bg];B[cm];W[bj];B[eg]C[Thought the game was over...

reid: Black get's nice outside thickness here, but because of the white stones at J4, it's not as valuable as it might seem.  In exchange, white got real territory on the left edge.  This was a good exchange for white.]
;W[dr];B[ob];W[pg]LB[oc:A]C[Really confused at this point, how to attack this for a profit?

reid: The problem here is that P18 was not an immediate threat so white doesn't feel he needs to respond.  A would have been more urgent.]
(;B[og]LB[of:C][qf:B][qg:A]C[reid: This seems like one of the reasonable ways to attack.  Other alternatives might be A or B.

You asked about C in the variation.  Black needs to decide what his goal is here.  The purpose of C would be to prevent white from connecting towards the L16 stones.  But it doesn't do anything to prevent white from making a base on the edge.  Also, C has very little effect on the stones towards L16.  It looks to me like it's more difficult to connect towards L16 than to make a base.  I think all of A, B, and P13 are better than C.]
;W[ph];B[oh]LB[qf:A]C[reid:  A better followup would be A.  Then the burden is on white to do something with these two stones.  He can probably live with them, but black will be in control of the fight. This move pushes white towards the weaker stones.]
;W[pi]
(;B[nj]C[reid: this is a difficult fight for white, and it's all-or-nothing.   I think the variation would be easier for black.]
;W[pj];B[qf];W[pl];B[pk];W[ok];B[qk];W[oj];B[ol];W[nk];B[lk]
LB[mj:A]C[reid: This is an odd move.  It's giving up on O10.  Even though O10 is awkwardly positioned, black is still better off responding at A, letting white push from behind.  This is going towards the area black wants to turn into territory, so why not go with it?

At this point, black's goal is not to kill white, but to turn that wall into real territory.]
;W[mj];B[mm];W[mh];B[li];W[lj];B[kj];W[ki];B[kk];W[lh];B[ji]
;W[kh];B[mk];W[ni];B[hm];W[jh];B[ih];W[cq];B[nb];W[cp]C[reid: This would be a good time to count.  

White has 20 on the left side, about 15 in the bottom left corner, let's be generous and say the top edge plus the center is another 10, for a total of 40.

Black has about 10 on the bottom edge, and the upper right corner plus the lower-right side is another 20.  That means black only needs 15 points from his center territory to be even.  Since the center already looks like 25 or 30, black should be comfortably ahead.]
;B[ho]LB[do:A]C[reid: Black is better off with the natural answer at A.  In the following sequence up to move 129, the white territory on the bottom grows while the black center shrinks.]

reid: yes.  black was expecting a bit much here.];B[fl];W[fq]
;B[gm];W[eq];B[lb]LB[oc:A][of:B][qq:C]C[reid: A would be better.  It defends tha aji in the corner and protects the cut at B.]
;W[kf];B[le]LB[qq:A]C[reid: Better to leave this move unplayed.  This area shouldn't be counted for either black or white.  Black A is bigger.]
;W[ke];B[rg];W[rh]
(;B[kn]LB[qq:A]C[reid: the corner (A) is still bigger.  Points for both sides.]

;W[mf];B[oe];W[lf]
(;B[bp]C[reid: This gives white a chance at the corner aji.  If black defends the corner, he should win the game.

In this game, black kept his lead from the handicap right up until the very end.

There were several places in this game where the power of a splitting attack came into play.  To avoid these kinds of attacks, try to avoid playing too thinly, and with too many irons in the fire.  Make a single moyo instead of several.

When you're ahead, focus on protecting your lead.

C[Wont black lose all the territory?

reid: A weak group usually translates into territory.  In this case, black wants to use this weak group to make territory from his big wall.  Something like A perhaps (good relation to J13).  White probably runs out with B.  It's tempting to keep chasing with C, but black should probably live with D instead of pushing white towards his prospective territory (black might be able to play E or F later if he doesn't have to worry about living with R9).]
