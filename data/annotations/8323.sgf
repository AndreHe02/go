C[Dear reviewer,

thanks for your time and advice.
I just ask a few questions on some points but in this game, I really don't know where both of us play good or bad so please comments on every points you see something interesting.

I play white in this game and my rank is around 1k-1d KGS, I think black must be around 2d but not sure of that.

Regards,

Florian m/

;B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op];B[qo];W[rr];B[no];W[oo]
;B[on];W[oq];B[pn];W[ci]C[Az: All very standard and proper so far.]
;B[gd];W[id]LB[de:A]C[Az: There's nothing wrong with 'a', just depends on your style. This obviously limits the moyo but starts a fight.]
;B[kc];W[je];B[dd];W[cd];B[ce];W[cc];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[gf];W[he]C[Az: White played very well here, no moves I would criticize or play differently. The result is horrendous for black.]
;B[ei];W[jc]C[Az: Although I dislike having to tenuki from the LHS, this is just huge.]
;B[cj]
(;W[qe]C[m/ : ok to tenuki c10?

Az: I think you should answer on the left now. K17 was completely urgent, this is not ugrent at all.]
;B[pd];W[rd];B[rc];W[qh];B[dj]C[Az: White's technique in the UR is good, but black is SO THICK here! Second tenuki was really bad.]
;W[cn];B[nq];W[or];B[iq];W[gq]TR[iq]LB[eq:A]C[Az: I would rather see w play 'a' to firmly secure the corner. This leaves tons of aji which you'll need to fix eventually (making you over concentrated), plus the B stone is very light so this is pure gote.]
;B[lq]LB[cq:C][kd:B][qj:A]C[Az: I don't like this move for B at all, he has many better moves.]
;W[ho]LB[qj:A]C[Az: This is urgent. 'a' is very big for security, but you shouldn't tenuki for it.]
;B[cl]C[Az:];W[dq]C[m/ : maybe slow?

Az: You have to defend here now. The problem wasn't this move, the problem was G3 much earlier, which meant you would have to face a situation like this later on.]
;B[rf];W[qf];B[re];W[of];B[gc];W[fb];B[kd]
(;W[kb]C[Az: This is not necessary, you are secure without it. So play something bigger instead. This is a pretty big mistake.]

(;W[ke];B[kh]LB[me:A]C[Az: You still have time to fix since black was being stupid. This is really a self-made problem.]

(;W[em];B[fl];W[el];B[fm];W[fn];B[gn];W[go];B[ek];W[en]C[Az: Too small. The 2 stones aren't worth that much, you should take big yose points like 'a' or 'b' instead. 

The game started out really well for you but then you created your own disaster in the UR which gave b a big center and made it close again. The 'loosing move' was probably played sometime in yose, but the real lesson to focus on is how you gave away your huge early lead. No more comments.]
