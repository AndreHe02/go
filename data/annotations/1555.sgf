C[aysen:  Hello.  Thank you for reviewing my game. :-) I played black (18k* IGS).  After I reviewed the game myself I have the feeling it was even until we entered the endgame (right or wrong?).  Then it seems I just messed up.  Or perhaps during the middle game?  My last games have all been quite the same, with similar frustrating  results. :-(  I´d appreciate some advice or some light on which is the error.
---------------------------------
Hi aysen.  Thanks for giving me an opportunity to review your game.  It's always helpful to have to clarify for myself some basic principles while going through other people's games.

In this game, I felt B fell behind in the opening.  But after some poor moves by W (24-26) he recovered and the game became more even.  However, B37 was ineffective.  Then B played some slow moves in the fight on the left side and allowed W to dictate the pace so that eventually W was able to turn thickness into territory in the center.

There were no major mistakes by B, but just a couple of slow moves here and there (21, 33, 37, 45, 49, 53, 57, 65) allowed W to gradually pull away.

It might be helpful for you to look at some books on opening to get a better sense of the direction of play and the importance of maintaining the balance of forces early in the game.  Looking at some pro games or dan-level games on IGS should be useful, too.    Don't take the variations too seriously, since I'm not not even 1d :)

Best,
KL];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pq];B[fc]SQ[cd][dp]LB[cj:a]C[This might not be ideal.  It's early in the game, of course, but with the two marked stones facing each other, B5 invites W a (or even one line further up), which'd reduce the "efficiency" of the UL enclosure.  See var.]

(;W[qf]C[This is acceptable, too.  The main thing is, W is playing at a faster pace in the opening.]

(;B[pf]C[The tsuke from the star stone should not be played lightly, since it usually solidifies the position immediately.  Quickly settling down is to W's advantage, since he's the one making an approach (and thus should come under some pressure).  What B gets is a rather small corner in this case.  It's small because there're certainly much bigger moves elsewhere at this stage in the game.

A pincer on the right side would be better, since it may later work double-duty by extending and approaching the lone W stone in LR corner.  See var.]
;W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[nd]SQ[of][og][pg][dp]C[Now all B's stones are on only one side of the board, while W has spread out his forces.  And the thickness of the marked stones correspond to the LL star stone's high position well.]
;W[lc]C[This is a bit reckless.]
(;B[nc]C[N17 would be better, to make W heavy.  See var.];W[hc]
;B[dg]C[Puzzling.  F15 would put more direct pressure on W's rather unreasonable 3-space extention here in B's sphere of influence.]
;W[le]C[W continues to aim to shut B out from the center.];B[ge]
C[H16 might work better to build up some outside thickness.  But then B17 would then be too close.]
;W[he];B[gd]C[G14 better.  To be pushed along the 7th line is a good thing :)  But then again, B17 would be too close]
;W[qo]
(;B[jp]C[Perhaps B should push through at H16 to punish W and take the initiative.  See var.

Here, instead of K4, K3 would be better.  This should be considered an "invasion" rather than a "reduction", since W's moyo is barely taking shape and B can go in deep safely.  With K3, B can make a nice 2-space extension on either side and settle down easily.

Alternatively, B could play c6 to build up his own moyo on the left, especially after having played D13.  Consider countering moyo with moyo before embarking on more risky invasion or redution.]
;W[ef]C[Not sure what this is for.]
(;B[df]C[Maybe G14?  W would have a hard time managing W24.  See var.]
;W[gf];B[ee];W[hd]C[Now B can cut at H14, especially since B23 is high and can provide support for any fighting to come in the center.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[cr]C[Pretty much any 2nd-line move so early in the game is bad :)  Too small.  See var.]
;W[ci]C[Rather too greedy.  C10 or even C9 better.];B[ck]C[C8 would be better.  It'd put more pressure on W's 3-stone group in the corner.]
;W[cl]
(;B[dl]C[Simply extend to D9 is better.  It'd force W jump out at E11, and then B can choose to attack either side.  See var.]
;W[cm];B[bk];W[ei]C[Now B cannot go on the offensive with the cutting pt at D9 to worry about.]
;B[dj];W[dh]C[Strange.];B[eg]C[This is too small.  B should pull his own group out into the center first, since W's corner is still unsettled.]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[di]C[B45 thus makes B41 stone bump into a solid W wall.  Such forcing moves are better left unplayed.]
;B[ej];W[fi];B[fj]C[Too slow.  G9 or F8 better.];W[gi];B[fm]
;W[fo];B[hp];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[in]C[Pushing behind is usually bad.  Too slow.]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[gk];W[hi];B[ij];W[lq]
(;B[kq]C[Here the contact play is bad because it simply solidifies W's position in the LR.  Plus, it leaves some weakness at J3.  See var.]

A quick count now shows:
B: 18+19+12+7 = 56
W: 12+7+21 = 41

B is well ahead.  Since the right side is fairly open still, B has a good chance, so long as he can carve out something there while allowing W a territory there that's not much bigger than his.    This appears difficult, however, because W's thickeness on both sides (marked stones).  Any B moves on the right would come under sever attack.
