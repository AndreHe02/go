But your group is already unconditionnaly alife : it's a big chain with a lot of eye space (triangles).

To conclude this review, I would like to highlight a few simple points : 

1. THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO MAKE A BASE FOR YOUR STONES : it prevents you from being chased around the goban.
For this reason, remember to play on the 3rd line when you invade : it is the only way to make a quick base.

2. Be ready to sacrifice some secondary stones in order to gain something important (win an important ko, take a big point on the board, save a group).

3. Make yourself strong before you attack or the attack may backfire on you.

4. Don't try to capture if you did not read the full sequence, because if you fail to capture, you will find yourself in a very bad position.

5. Practice some Life & Death problems : they will greatly help you to make your groups live, to kill your apponent's groups and save you unnecessary defense move.



Well, that's it ! I hope that you enjoyed reading this review and that it will be useful :)

I wish you a lot of fun playing Go !
