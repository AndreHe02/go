AB[pd][dp];W[pp];B[ed];W[nq]TR[nc][cd][jd][qf][dj][cn][fq]C[There's a go proverb that says you should rush to plant your flag early. You're playing against a two-stone handicap. You don't have time to lock down a corner before making big plays. Approach or take a big point right away.]
;B[df]C[These plays from black leave plenty of room for invasion later.]
;W[ql]TR[qj]SQ[cc][nc][cd][qf][cn][fq]C[This is a fairly small play. Better to move out further or approach/invade.]
;B[qg];W[cn];B[hp];W[jq]TR[cq]C[Better to keep playing in the corner so your approach stone doesn't become surrounded. Perhaps at the marked spot.]
;B[iq]TR[ck][dk][cl][dl]C[If black had played somewhere around here instead, it could've been trouble for your approaching stone.]
;W[ir]TR[jp]C[Usually hane against a contact play is right, but this feels awkward. Here perhaps?]
;B[hr];W[jr];B[di];W[cj]C[A three-point extension is not perfectly safe, but since you're playing against a handicap it's probably good. This helps finally settle your stone in the corner. Good.]
;B[jd]C[Notice right now how much the game looks in black's favor. Making 4 out of 5 of your first plays in one corner is now starting to really hurt.]
;W[qc]TR[lc][mc][nc]C[You have the right idea to invade. Black's potential territory is getting quite large, but this is probably not the best place to do it. Notice how black ends up getting a very strong position along the top. I might try one of the marked spots instead. You can make a bigger impact with an invasion on the side than one in the corner.]

[sr][as][bs][rs][ss]C[Overall, look at the way cuts were handled in this game. Both sides made mistakes in that area, and there's plenty to learn from here. Also look for areas where you made small plays when big ones were available. Primarly, moving into black's bottom-left corner and securing what should've been your bottom-right corner. Also, the opening plays where you stayed too long in one corner instead of taking more big points.

Feel free to contact me if you want me to clarify anything I said or if you have any questions.]
