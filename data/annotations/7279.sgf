(;B[fd]LB[ec:B][ed:A]C[Imagist: This doesn't put enough pressure on the white corner.  I don't fully understand where this move would be appropriate, but there are lots of professional games to show by example.

I assume that you are trying to build a moyo and want to avoid a pincer by white.  There are a few issues with this idea.
1) As your opponent shows, a pincer is still possible.
2) A pincer against the high approach at A doesn't necessarily prevent a moyo (see variations on the previous move).
3) Even if white gets the "expected" response at B, black doesn't get sente to build a moyo, or the resulting moyo isn't very good (see variations on THIS move).]
;W[ic];B[dc]LB[cc:A]C[Imagist: You need to play at A.  You can't give white the corner AND a play on the side.]
;W[cc];B[dd];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[lc]C[Imagist: Strengthening yourself and then attacking with a pincer is a good reflex, but unfortunately it's not very severe here.  White has lots of room to run out, and black hasn't really solidified anything on the top right.]
;W[ie];B[hd]LB[fg:A][ig:C][dh:B]C[Imagist: Classic case of aji keshi.  This play strengthens your opponent.  I would play A hoping for a white play around B to get a capping attack at C.]
;W[id];B[ch]TR[dc][dd][fd][hd][ee]C[Imagist: No good.  The marked stones are weak and white's stones are strong.]
;W[ef]C[Imagist: This play is too good for white.  It splits black into two weak groups.]
;B[he]
(;W[hf]LB[fe:B][cj:A]C[Imagist: Good shape, wrong full-board perspective.  The pincer at A would be devastating (see variation starting at B).]
;B[gf];W[hg];B[ff];W[qo]LB[ck:A]C[Imagist: I expected white A here.]

(;B[qp]LB[if:A]C[Imagist: This may be a joseki in some books but it's not great in most situations.  I would pincer here, but if you want to take the corner, play P4 first (see variation).  It's worth noting that common pincers break the ladder resulting from the cut at A, so a pincer really would be very powerful.]
;W[po];B[mp];W[ol]C[Imagist: Weird.];B[qh]C[Imagist: This shape does nothing for the top right except make white's 3-3 invasion more sweet (see variation).]

(;W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[qq];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[ps];W[nn];B[qk]
LB[qd:B][ip:A]C[Imagist: A or something similar is necessary to protect the two stones.  As for territory moves, B is much bigger.]
;W[jq];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[jo];B[lm];W[ml];B[ll];W[gq]LB[lk:A]
C[Imagist: White should have played A.];B[cn]LB[if:B][mk:A]
C[Imagist: Black should cap at A.  It's good shape, threatens the cutting point at B, and strengthens black's weak group while slightly threatening white's group (which isn't entirely strong).  This move allows white to split black on the left creating more weak groups.]
;W[cl];B[dm]LB[cq:A]C[Imagist: Best to jump into the corner and settle quickly at A.  Black has too many weak stones on the board.]
;W[dl];B[fm];W[el];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[gp];B[eh];W[fg];B[fh]
;W[gg];B[hc]LB[eh:2][lm:3][ep:1]TR[cl][dl][el]C[Imagist: Black has not one, but THREE weak groups on the board.]
;W[gk]C[Imagist: White strengthens her weakest group, splitting black even more severely.]
;B[gl]LB[mk:A]C[Imagist: A reasonable move.  I think A is slightly better.]
;W[gj]C[Imagist: White responds incorrectly!];B[bf];W[be];B[cf]
;W[ce];B[dg]LB[ej:A]C[Imagist: Not necessary and not sente (even though white responded).  The weakness in white's shape at A would be better.]
;W[eg];B[cj]LB[ej:A]C[Imagist: A better.];W[fl];B[gm];W[gh]
;B[dj]LB[ej:A]C[Imagist: A better.];W[qc]C[Imagist: Ouch.];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qf]LB[rf:A]C[Imagist: Overplay.  A is better.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[rg];B[rh];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[qg];W[rf]
;B[lf]LB[if:B][mk:A]TR[ic][id][ie]C[Imagist: Don't play close to a wall like this.  A, preparing to cut at B, is better, because then you can attack the three stones, which is a much better use of the wall you just created.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[ng];W[jm]C[Imagist: This splitting attack by white finishes the game.  At least one of your groups survived due to mistakes by white (I point this out in a later comment).

While I did see some shape mistakes, I don't think shape is your major issue is shape.  Your big mistakes were in full-board reasoning -- keep better track of weak and strong groups!  Throughout the game, white had all the strong groups and you had all the weak ones.  You mentioned thickness in your game review request, but keep in mind that thickness is only a particularly useful kind of strength.

I put in a lot of joseki variations, but I don't advise that you memorize them.  Instead, look at them for ideas.  My main advice joseki-wise is to seek more severity in your moves.  In the top left in particular, you didn't threaten white with anything until your pincer at M17, and by that time white had too much of an advantage for your threat to be very effective.  Every move should acheive something (territory or strength) AND make your opponent afraid not to respond if possible.  Moves like black 5 and 7 don't cut it.]
