C[In this game I played White.  It seems I was able to create some decent central influence but I was unable to kill a couple of Black invasions that I thought should not have lived.  I also have a feeling that my opening was weak but I cannot think of a better way to have played.

-Hello! I am muammer. I am around 2k. 
About opening:Unless you play an obviously small move (like on the first line), you cannot make a losing move at opening. But making good moves at fuseki enables you to develop the mid-game much easier (building moyo, attacking efficiently) 

About fights: I guess you already found your mistakes in fight. Because the outcomes of a bad move during/before a fight are usually severe. But if I see you missed a move, I will point out that moves too.

Let's go! :)];B[qd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[jp];W[od]C[-];B[pd]
(;W[oc]TR[oe]C[-I would prefer P15 instead. Because with that move black makes a nice moyo start. See variation at move 7.]
(;B[lc]TR[oe]C[- This move does not serve black's purpose. Black should have P15'd. Very critical point. See variation at the move before.]
;W[jc]SQ[oc][od]C[-Maybe this pincer was a bit aggressive. It is obvious black will jump, implying your sones at p17 p16 will be pincered too. Maybe you could simply Q14or P14. After settling with those exchange moves you can pincer with K17 or K16.]
;B[le];W[of];B[pf];W[og];B[pc];W[pg]C[-Here you ommited Q15. It is OK. (Because black cannot P15 since you have the ladder at D4) But keep an eye on possible ladder breakers.]
;B[qf];W[pk];B[rl]
(;W[oe]C[P15 not necessary. See variation at move 20.];B[qg]
;W[qh];B[hc];W[je]C[Good move];B[lg]
(;W[he]C[G16 maybe];B[dc];W[ed]C[Nobi here means letting black live and getting a wall here. It can be preferred. E17 is also possible.]

[oe][of]C[-Now is the time to look at the whole board. (Actually we should look at every move -even at fights-)

Black has some net profit. (Triangle)
White has two walls. (Squares)
Black has some stones to be attacked (Circles)

Now whole strategy should be based on this. If you now start to make pure area, you cannot win. Those stones (Especially M13 group) should be taken advantage of.

Let's see.];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[ei]CR[jh]
[ki][lj]TR[lc][le][lg]C[-Exchanging  those 6 moves are good for black since it makes an easy life and has an ideal shape. 

White again is building a wall to attack those stones. Now those are trapped in a sea of black stones. I think black should immediatly play an escaping move around the circles. I really cannot calculate which point would be the best. It is a hard job :)]
;B[cm];W[li]C[54 caps in the three B stones at the top.  I really don't think he should have lived, but somehow he did.

-M11 very severe move. 
Now black must make life inside or connect to H17 group. Can he connect with K17? That is an intersting move. See variations at move 55.]

;B[ld]
(;W[jd]C[I think maybe I didn't need to play K16.

- You are right. With K13 or L12, Black would be in a bigger trouble]
;B[jg];W[ji];B[kh]C[Bad move. White making a solid seal.];W[ki]
;B[jf];W[mh];B[mg];W[ng];B[ne]
(;W[lf];B[nf]C[I missed N14 during actual play, it could have helped.

-Yes B cannot make two eyes. Maybe N14 at move 76 would make the kill easier.]
(;W[nd];B[mf];W[op];B[lh]C[Bad move, wasting ko threat, erasing W's weakness at N11.]
;W[ni];B[pp]C[Again similar play. This move is not really popular but black kinda likes it i guess. Again both directions possible.]
;W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[os]
;W[ns];B[fq];W[hq]C[Good move.];B[lq]C[B should escape. M3 is too dangerous and gives almost nothing to black.]
;W[ho]C[An other good one];B[dq]
(;W[fp]C[W usually plays E3 instead of F4.];B[cp];W[do];B[co]
;W[dn];B[eq];W[fo];B[ej];W[fj];B[ek];W[fk];B[jm]C[Now the fight for the center begins.  I wonder if I should have played K2 first?

-I do not see any weaknesses at left side for white. Thus, I do not think black can connect to anywhere. So K2 is possible, stealing B's eye shape.L5 is also possible. H7 is OK too.]
(;W[hm];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[ks]
(;B[bf]C[Small move. B should try for life]
(;W[is];B[kr];W[ls];B[mp]TR[js][ms]C[This is not kikashi . W is connected below.]

;B[mk];W[mj];B[gr];W[gq];B[fr]C[I think you played very well. You have attacked both groups very effectively. Attacking this well is due to your walls you have built in the beginning. So I do not think I can point out a major mistake at opening.(Maybe  some small gote moves like P15 but they still are not major) 
In both fights you missed 1-2  final moves, but seems you figured them out now.

I hope my comments will be useful.


Have a good sunday!
