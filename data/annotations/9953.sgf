;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for reviewing my game. It was played on Tygem between 5k players on standard time control (20 min+ 3*30sec byoyomi). I was playing as white in the end lost by 30 points, however the game is worth reviewing only until a certain point  where I should have resigned (if I could count at least) and the rest is not included in the sgf.

The problem was one time I died and two times my opponent challenged me to kill him and I failed. This is what this review is about: The correct way to handle your opponent just taking territory along the sides and then playing a random move inside your influence followed by running out while trying to peep at your defects. Interestingly enaugh, players with that style don't seem to think about their moves. I think my opponent used a total 10 minutes of his time for the whole game, which went to counting, while my total thinking time was probably over 40 minutes. Nevertheless, even without reading my opponent managed to outplay me. I hope you can tell me where I went wrong. Very much looking forward to learn from your experience.

--------

Alex: Thanks for sending such an interesting game for review!  There was a lot of complicated fighting, with mistakes on both sides.  This is the sort of game you can learn a lot from.

What stands out is not so much the moves, but your attitude in the comments!  "Maybe my move is also not good" ... "otherwise I'm left with only one corner as territory and would pretty much have to resign" ..."this move is probably wrong" ..."I assumed my last chance to win the game is to kill the D9 group" ... "this variation works wonders against me" ... and so on.  If you spend the whole game thinking you're going to lose, then it has a bad effect on your judgement.  You need to practice looking at the strong and weak aspects of your own groups and your opponent's groups, without so much emotion.  Especially learn to appreciate your own strengths and spot the other player's weaknesses.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[fr]C[I know this is not a real move, but I wanted to try it  just once. Amazingly enaugh it worked wonders even at 5k.]

(;B[eq]C[Alex: I'm not sure what the right move is for black, but I'm sure this isn't it!  Maybe E2, or maybe leave this position and play in another part of the board?]
;W[dq];B[er];W[dr]C[Alex: So far you've got a good position: better than you deserved!]
;B[ds]C[not entirelly sure what to do here. In any case this should be good for white now.

Alex: It's too early in the game to be thinking about territory.  See the variation to the next move.]

(;W[cs];B[es];W[cq]C[I wonder if black could play something like the variation here.

Alex: Yes.]
(;B[iq];W[cm]C[I think I'm happy with this result. However it shouldn't be much of a difference.]
;B[cj]C[I think this is wrong direction by black. He should have played on the right side, maybe Q8 or Q9.

Alex: Q9 or R9 would be usual move on the right.  Have you heard of the Chinese fuseki?

Yes, C10 is a bad move: white can easily attack this stone.]

(;W[ch]C[just to see what he does. Maybe my move is also not good, as black could just tenuki here.

Alex: No, this is a good move.  I think I'd prefer C13, as it makes better shape with D16, but your move is OK too.]
;B[dl];W[cl]C[this move is probably too slow. Black should tenuki.

Alex: No, this move is good too!  You're taking territory while attacking.  The problem is that you stopped attacking too soon!]
;B[dk]
(;W[po]TR[dl][dk][cj]C[I spoil black's framework plan. Black should probably pincer here.

Alex: Yes, this is a big move, but attacking black's weak stones is more urgent.  See the variation.

Also, when you're coming in to a strong black position, it's safer to approach from a distance: R6 not Q5.]

(;B[qo]
(;W[qn]C[Alex: Here you might want to think about try to spoil black's formation by playing for influence: see the variation.]
;B[qp];W[pn]C[Here I was again surprised that my opponent didn't play as in the variation, which is what you usually see at 5k, rather than the actual "standard" joseki move.

Alex: The joseki move is better for black.  I've added some comments at the end of your variation.]

(;B[nq];W[qj];B[qh];W[oj];B[oh]C[I don't really think this threatens me, but again my opponent played strangeley calmly, not testing that.

Alex: Yes, P12 looks very slow.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]
(;B[pf]C[overconcentrated? I was expecting the variation, which everyone plays at 5k even without the stones at P12 and R12 (and this variation works wonders against me)

Alex: Yes, overconcentrated: P17 was a mistake.  Actually, the variation is good for white: I've added a comment at the end.]
;W[jd]C[I should probably play low instead. Was thinking I can build the middle after attacking D9, when black invariable decides to invade both my corner and side.

Alex: It's hard to say whether low or high is better here.  Your move looks OK to me.]

(;B[cc]C[which he does right away. I think some other move is probably better. Maybe D17 instead? Or E18? F17?

Alex: No, this is reasonable.  White has made an extension on both sides: it's the ideal time to invade.  F17 would be awful: see the variation.  If I were going to play somewhere else, I'd choose N6 for black.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf]
(;W[bg]C[Alex: This is a little bit greedy, and you pay for it later when black can threaten D13.  Just play the solid move at C13 instead.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[hc]C[and this is where it gets interesting. I have to somehow attack this thing for profit now, otherwise I'm left with only one corner as territory and would pretty much have to resign, as black's lead is more than 20 points.

Alex: Yes, it does get interesting!  H17 is a bad move.  You need to keep a positive atttitude: not "if I get this wrong then I have to resign", but "here is a chance for me to attack and win the game!"]

(;W[ic]C[try to make him heavy. maybe he should jump instead and maybe I should have capped instead of kicking.

Alex: J17 isn't bad, but G16 looks stronger.];B[hd]
(;W[ge]C[this move is probably wrong but I worry about my shape defects on the left side. Maybe again I should try to cap him? It looks scary though.

Alex: Yes, the cap feels better.  Your defects on the left mean you have to sacrifice a stone or two: don't try to capture *everything*!]
;B[id]C[Alex: Try to attack on a large scale.  If black captures J17, it's only half an eye.  Make a big net and don't let black get out!]

(;W[jc];B[if];W[je]C[trying to prevent black's hane there.

Alex: Good.];B[hf]
(;W[jf]C[probably wrong direction. I should try to split black's two weak groups.

Alex: Yes.  Or jump ahead on a larger scale.];B[hh]C[I decide there is nothing to gain from attacking that right now and try to make some exchanges before resuming and splitting black's two groups.]
;W[mo]C[Alex: Good move.];B[lp]TR[dl][dk][cj][hh][hf][if][id]
[hd][hc]C[maybe black should have not responded and connected his groups. I knew he wouldn't do that though, because he thinks they are both perfectly fine and the game is won, might actually be true even.

Alex: Keep a positive attitude!  Black has nine stones at the top and left with not a single eye.  You still have good chances to win this game.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gp]C[this is maybe not good.

Alex: This is too slow: black doesn't need to answer.  Instead, now is the time to split those two weak groups!]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[fp];W[fn]C[sente];B[go];W[fj]C[trying to split and attack.]
;B[dg]C[black says he kills me and actually does, at which point the game is over.]

(;W[dh]C[Alex: Better to connect solidly.  See the variation.  (I wouldn't be able to read this variation over the board--it's too complicated--but even on general principles, the solid connection will work better in a fight.)]
;B[eg]C[I decide that I can't connect that.

Alex: I don't agree!  See the variation to the next move.]
(;W[eh];B[cg]C[maybe this was too desperate by me though.];W[ee]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[ag];W[ci]C[I assumed my last chance to win the game is to kill the D9 group. However I didn't read out the life and death of my top group properly.]
;B[bj];W[ai];B[fi]C[not sure what to do here.

Alex: I think E10 is the simplest way out: see the variation to the next move.]

(;W[fh]C[black's next move surprised me. The variation looks even scarier.]

(;B[ej];W[gi];B[ei];W[gh];B[fk]C[Alex: At this point I think you should give up trying to kill the stones on the left, and attack the top group instead.  Start by keeping your own groups connected: see the variation to the next move.]

(;W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[gn]C[I decide that it's not possible to kill after all (which means I lost the game) but play on hoping for I don't even know what.

Alex: Play on hoping for a mistake from your opponent!  If black's stones at the top die, then you're still winning. And if not, black is still only 10-15 points ahead, and it's easy to lose that many points through careless endgame play.  At 5 kyu level, the game isn't over unless you're at least 20 points down.

This is the last comment.  The last fight is interesting, but you've answered all of your own questions!]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[hm];B[gm];W[io]C[If my top group wasn't in trouble at this point, maybe black would be ahead by only about 10 points after komi.]

;B[mk];W[nj];B[km];W[ln];B[ji];W[jk]C[maybe J9 is better but I didn't want to give black K8 in sente.]
;B[nm];W[nk];B[lh];W[nl];B[ml];W[mg];B[om];W[op]C[wrong move.]
;B[nh];W[lf];B[pk];W[pj];B[qk];W[pl];B[ol];W[ok];B[pm];W[ql]
;B[qm];W[rk];B[rn];W[rm]C[I wonder if black is dead now... I guess O5 works here as well, because I played P4. Black made the terrible mistake of responding here.]
;B[ro]C[I should fix the connection around O5 now but I don't see it. If black dies, the game is about even.]
;W[kn]C[unnecassary and game loosing move.];B[no]C[game over and I should resign. The rest of the game is not incluced. I play on and actually manage to get all from H2 to P2 and above as territory but still loose by 30 points in the end.]

Black has 10 at the top left, a bit over 20 at top right, a bit over 30 at the bottom, and not very much in the centre: again maybe 70 points.]

I'd start by playing a pincer at the top.  It's hard to say which move is best, but anything in the general area of J16 should work OK.]
