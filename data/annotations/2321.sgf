(;B[rp]LB[mp:a]C[This is very territory hungry, and an older style of play.  It is considered slack now, as white can start a fight by cutting at 'A' when the time is right, but white ends with sente, so it's slow.

Additionally M3 would probably like to be futher away perhaps at J3?]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[ph]C[This is great for black]
;W[jd]C[Black needs to ask the question, what is this white move trying to do?  I think white is trying to get center thickness as black settles.  So black should settle in a way that deny's white his goal, as running away will only help white accomplish his goal.]

(;B[le]C[Escaping seems futile.  White is already out and away.  Better to settle fast.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[od];B[qd];W[pb]
(;B[mb]TR[le][lc]C[This steals the base from White trying to kill the white group.  A bit unreasonable really.  White has a lot of running room and is stronger them black.  You normally don't attack when your weaker.  You settle your stones first.  A counter pincer around 'A' is preferred.  You can actually give up these two white stones, as they are light, and it takes a lot of effort for white to capture them.  So you'd take territory on the top while he chased them.]
;W[ni];B[nk]C[This is the wrong direction.  You can't really threaten those white stones.  They are far stronger then the Black stones at the top which are very tightly pincered at K16.  Black still hasn't answered that move.  Furthermore Black only takes an additional 4-8 points with this move.  It's strictly a territory move.  White can still cut at N4 and destroy a lot of this area.]
;W[kd]C[White begins the attack.  White has enough stones in the right place to build very big thickness and in the end will get a strong area of territory in the top left resulting from this fight.]
;B[ld];W[kg]C[Black can not get out, he must settle on the side and leave the weakness to exploit later.  To settle this now will only make white stronger.  If Black can get it out, it's not worth the trade off of making White stronger.  It's all dame point for black.  While black settel white is developing nicely.  One way streets like this should be avoided.]

(;B[lo]C[This makes sets up to develop the bottom and locks white into the corner.  White can destroy about 15 points on the left side, but if he does that makes you stronger on the left and gains you about 25 points in the middle.  White gets nothing for it other than destroying potential.  So if you preserve those 15 points you leave open the ability to wreck 25 points in the middle as that situation is not addressed at all by playing S4.]
