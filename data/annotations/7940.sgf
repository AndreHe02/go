C[Numsgil [7k\]: hi

N: So I'll mark my post game comments like this.  I played black.  0.5 komi.

I think I've just started to get the hang of walls and influence, and I'm rather proud of this game.  I think both my opponent and I played a strong game, considering our levels.  I think some mistakes were made by both sides, but it had the _feel_ of being right on the knife's edge like higher level games are usually played.

I lost in the end because I always think big eyes in the corner are worth as many liberties as big eyes in the center.  But before that is was neck and neck.

Lots of comments in file, just so you can see the sort of narrative I'm walking myself through.  I left out alternate reading sequences, though, just to make it easy to actually plow through and follow.

I'd appreciate the review going all the way to the end, especially since the game was so close.

Thanks!

===
My comments occur below the "==="

You played well for most of the game! For most of the game you were up by a bit, and at the end it was very close. The main area that I think is lacking from your play in this game is an appreciation for the status of groups, and how to properly handle the middle game. There were many situations where you had a great chance to attack, but didn't. You also didn't pay attention to your own weak groups, and that's how white caught up. In the end, you didn't pay attention to yet another weak group, and white won.

If you learn more about the middle game, and get a feel for groups, attack, defense, and flow you will improve greatly!

I spent alot of time and have alot of variations. Many of my variations go pretty deep, and those aren't meant to be authoritative, but merely to show you some intuition into the situation. They're not meant to be read to that depth, but more so to show what I mean when I say "I feel like there's danger here..." Some of the longer variations, while probably full of mistakes for both sides, show more so the feel of what might be there.]

[fq:C]TR[fc]C[===

For the Chinese fuseki, A or B.

For the Kobayahi fuseki, C

I don't know of any fuseki around F17, but that's not to say it's bad. I think that usually the idea is to develop large, but still helping out the 3-4 stone in the process. The approach at F3 is to develop big, but also to develop in a way to benefit and work with Q3.

See variation.]
(;B[fc];W[cf]
(;B[id]C[N: This is a bit thin, but the idea is that I can go back and either make the D18 C17 exchange later in sente, or outright invade the corner.

If I do want to invade the corner, though, I'm not sure what to aim for.  ko life?  Connect to the outside?  Maybe the probe at D17 is better?  I can't find this position in any joseki databases.

I'm likewise clueless about the larger extension to K16.  I understand the idea of playing lightly/thinly, but I don't really know what I should go for if a white invasion does happen.

===

Hard to say, but I think the main thing is that this is on the sub-optimal side. You'd probably rather this be along the bottom side, as previously mentioned.

I know that J16 is commonly frowned upon compared to K16 or J17, but there are many situations where it could be fine. Go Seigen was also fond of the J16-like extensions, but I don't know all the details pertaining to when they should and when they shouldn't be used.

As for what to do to live in the corner, see the variations from the prior move (with black K16).]
;W[po]C[===

Here is where you sort of wish the top formation was on bottom. If that were the case, a high pincer would be great for you. 

On this board, I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like you want to still pincer and develop the top side more.]
(;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[np]C[N: Played high because white's stone on the left is high.  Is that right?

===

I'm not familiar enough with the distinction to say. Many times with these variations, going up to the fourth line is more common when you have an existing stone on the third as an extension, thus developing a moyo on bottom. But again, I don't know about specifically here.]
;W[qj];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[N: Like before.];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[N: The goal was to fix shape on the left in sente and force him to the corner and build a wall facing the top.  But would that be over concentrated or just right?  Or at least, would it be the best response I should expect?

===

This feels odd, and it looks like the wrong direction. Your corner stone is the one who is a little lonely now, but you are right that J16 does need something additionally to live. Perhaps this is part of the awkwardness of J16. If J16 were at K16, you'd kick white's stone, and if worst came to worst you could go to C17 and live. If J16 were at J17, you're side would feel safe currently.

See variations though for a few options for black.];W[ne]C[N: White runs, but I'm strong on the top so I'm not sure what he thinks he's accomplishing.  The resulting wall will be basically worthless, right?

===

He's weakening your corner quite a bit, but you get to defend with R14 now or similar.]
;B[pf]C[N: Or would I be better off low?

===

Probably, as you still owe a move down there. High does put more pressure on white though, but your corner stones seems weak.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]C[===

This seems pretty slow for white.];B[qh]C[N: Feels necessary to keep this group alive.  Maybe why I should have played low at R14 instead.

===

Yes, I think your feelings are correct. This also has bearing on the Q6 group. If you can attack white's O17 with a capping play, e.g. at O12 later, the R8 throw in might become pretty viable.]
(;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]C[N: Ouch, white has a lot of the corner.]
;W[sb];B[oi]C[N: Don't want to be enclosed along the side.  Recently I've started learning sector lines.  This move breaks through white's sector line from R10 to O15 and starts a new black sector line from P11 to J16 which threatens to enclose white.

===

Yes, splitting does in fact help you out. It helps you break out, breaks influence, and lets you possibly attack white Q6 group. This move does feel lax though, as white can just defend calmly.]
(;W[lp]
(;B[kq]C[N: Proper response?  I figure I kick to make him heavy, AND protect this side group's eye space/territory.

===

You're assuming white will play M3 next. I don't think M4 was an advisable move by white, perhaps you should split and make white have two weak groups to worry about. If you look at the board, it's still close, and the will come down to if white can develop the left, and if you can attack groups. See variations.]
(;W[lq]C[===

You seem fortunate.]
(;B[kn]C[N: Attacking white, and building a wall at the same time.

===

I think your intentions and priorities here are wrong. You want to split white, with two weak groups, where the death of either would give you a large advantage, how can he hope to win? 

Now, this might be a good move, but with a completely different intention. A powerful technique of attack is to drive two of your opponent's weak groups towards each other, but to NOT let them connect. That can set up what's called a splitting attack, where with one move or so, you disconnect his two groups entirely, and both are too weak to save them both. If you have thought this through, and think that whatever white does you'll be able to split him, this is a very powerful move. Again, it's for the intention of splitting with black's next move.

The problem with the intention I think you stated is that this direction drives white to unite his two weak groups into one strong group, thus eliminating your advantage. Again, that can be a strategy if you know you can split him at the last second, thus making both groups very weak, but that has to be the intention.

Making territory is important, but the middle game is all about the status of groups, and a little more care to the status of groups will give you dramatic improvements in strength. I recommend "Attack and Defense" by Davies as an introduction to the middle game-play.

A wall is useful on the bottom, but that's to only limit white's left development, which you can do so with simple reducing moves.]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[ln];B[km]C[===

Anot now white can unify and his worries are relatively over. White's still a little down, but he can develop the left a bit, and he can at least take an easy breath and plan on taking back ground in yose.

Your wall is a little useful for reducing white's left side, but not too much.]
;W[mo];B[in]C[N: Necessary?  I was sweating the cut, but in post game reading I think the short ladder works?]
;W[hp]C[N: An invasion.  Seems like an overplay, since white already has the weak-ish group on the right?

H5 would seem better.

===

The group on the right is not weak at all, it's very strong and connected. But yes, this is odd and probably an overplay. Your goal should be to cover white, and stay connected. If you do so you will live, no matter what, and you'll have a strong group that can stop white from making anything out of the left side.]
(;B[fo]C[N: Maybe this should have been the knights jump at H5? (knights jump for attacking, single jump for running).

===

This seems very soft on white. Yes, the knights move is more severe. See variation.]
;W[gp];B[fp];W[hn]C[N: Was that a tesuji combination white just pulled?  White's invasion has somehow broken through my sector line.

Anyway, I can still chase white and build a wall.

===

No tesuji. Just kill the two stones with your own tesuji ;) See variations on the next move.]
(;B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[gn];B[fn];W[gl];B[fm];W[il];B[hk];W[im]
C[===

So yeah, you got split into two groups. Both have defects, and K5 is close to being weak.]
;B[fk];W[ik];B[hj]C[N: Wall is coming along nicely and peeking into the potential side territory on the left.

And white is still in trouble, right on the doorway of my sector line here.

===

Black is also in a dangerous position. Black is on the verge of becoming very weak, and white is about to become strong. See variation.]
(;W[kk]C[===

White is attacking too, you need to be careful.];B[ll]C[N: I'm a bit concerned that my black group here is getting squeezed, but considering the massive strength of the wall on the left I figure it's still a good exchange?

Eye space is scarce, but I figure I can run under white and connect to the group on the left around H2

===

A wall is only worth as much as the value you can derive from it. Sure, you can stop white from making much territory on the left side, and the lower left corner is weak, but if you give up K4, that's almost a game-losing exchange. It was much better to keep your stones connected and surroud white earlier when you had the chance. 

You are right in that there's potential to connect around H2, but it's a little tricky and probably a ko at best. White is getting weak, but so are you, so it's not certain what will happen. Also, as mentioned earlier, j3 is a big point for white.]
;W[lk];B[ml];W[nj];B[mk];W[mj];B[lj]C[N: Ladder doesn't work for white.

Pretty much if the ladder doesn't work I cut.  Is that a reasonable rule of thumb?

===

No, some cuts are not as valuable as you think, and if the ladder works that doesn't mean there aren't ladder breakers that are just as valuable as the cut. Additionally, white could let it go, but get out himself doing so.]
(;W[kj];B[li];W[ki];B[mh]C[N:  White is contained and doesn't really have anywhere to run to, and has little to no eyespace.  I'm starting to get concerned about eyespace right about now for my M8 group, though.]
(;W[nk];B[nl]C[N: Sente exchange, since I can capture these three white stones if white does nothing.  Plus, it starts to hurt the bottom white stones a bit.]
;W[pk];B[ir]C[N: Now the game of chicken has gone on long enough and I want some solid life.  I thought I could large knight across the second line to connect (like you can do to connect on the first line), but this apparently doesn't work here?

===

No not at all, you have to read white H2.];W[hr]C[N: Can't read a way to connect, so I'm trying to read a way to make 2 eyes on the side here.

=== 

Doesn't seem like it's possible. This whole fiasco let white get back in the game, and get in a comfortable postion to enter yose with.]
;B[lr];W[mr];B[ks];W[nq];B[jr];W[iq]C[N: White screws me over.  Now I only have 1 eye.]
;B[is];W[jq];B[kp]C[N: Connect in sente.  Maybe I can kill something or make another eye.

Although actually, is this sente?  If white ignores I can get ko life maybe?]
;W[lo];B[nn]C[N: Maybe I can kill this white group here.  Maybe I can build up enough of a wall here to get a second eye.  Really just squirming around desperately at this point.

===

Naw, it's very difficult now.];W[no];B[oo]C[N: Please cut from the bottom white...]
;W[op]C[N: Yay!];B[on]C[N: Halfway to a second eye.];W[pp]C[N: Lax or just right?  Starts to threaten the corner.  Making me live in gote would give white a good opportunity now to invade the corner and probably kill it.]
;B[ol]C[N: I don't think this will work.

===

No.]
(;W[ok]C[N: But white allows it for some reason?  Some sequence I didn't see?  Seems that if white goes Q8 instead he'd still be alive and connected together and have one solid eye and could probably build a second along the edge.  Even if he can't, it's a huge battle and white would have time to invade teh corner?

===

Nope, you got lucky. No huge battle, because with white Q8 he's just alive and you're not. O4 is an eye, remember, and you even have to blow a move at n4 to make it not be two. 

Huge mistake by white, else you would of been in serious trouble.]
;B[pl]C[N: I expected white to Q7 and destroy the eyespace, and then I'd R8 and try to separate him.  But I guess once separated I win the capture race.

===

There's no way white can Q7.]
(;W[ql]C[N: Yay, white lets me live...];B[pm];W[qm]C[N: In sente even!

===

Yes, white really screwed up. If you had ended in gote, white could of at least killed the lower right corner for compensation. See variation.]
(;B[rq]C[N: Protect the corner.  I'm really not good with this sort of L&D.  What sort of shape should I be aiming for?

===

You are correct that you must defend, and that looks like a vital point.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[lh]C[N: I figure these stones are basically dead weight.  Not sure in hindsight.  Without them white has no eye space and is disconnected.

===

Your hindsight is correct, these stones are still valuable, and you can use the attack on white to profit.]
;B[cq]C[N: I figure the time is right to do something about this corner.  I have _huge_ thickness to the right, but I really have no idea what to aim for.]
;W[dq]
(;B[cp]C[===

Whoa, maybe you can get away with this since you're so strong right next door. This forces white's hand a little, and F5 is just so strong, that maybe this is good.]
;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
(;B[co]C[N: I can do this in sente because of the cut at D6.

Really I'm not sure how to ensure life for this corner.  Would this be considered bad since I'm butting heads AND forcing white to connect solidly?  Did I gain anything from the exchange?

===

White gained alot if white get D7, because D7 protects against B6.]
;W[dm];B[bn]C[===

Now white ends pefectly protected.];W[bm];B[bo]C[N: I feel pretty confident this corner is alive now.

===

Of course, it's like joseki, but even a little larger. White ends in sente, if you had B6 instead of C5, that would not be the case.]
;W[gr];B[cl]C[N: Peep.

Good?

===

Sure. It's unfortunate that white connected out to G2 so easily.]
;W[cm];B[cc]C[N: Trying for corners again.  I have less thickness here, so I'm not sure what to go for.  I figure white has an extra stone but so do I (J16), so maybe I'll try for something like the pincered corner invasion.]
;W[dc]
(;B[cd]C[===

So here you'd want to play the joseki probably.];W[ce];B[cb]
C[N: So if we pretend this is the pincer corner invasion, white has overplayed (the ladder at D15 doesn't work) so I try using the refutation sequence.

===

This is different, in the pincer joseki white doesn't have the C14 stone. With that, white only has to cover one side at a time.]
;W[db];B[de]C[N: Ladder doesn't work here.  Neither does short ladder (I don't think).]
(;W[ee]C[N: But white decides to play it out for a bit anyway.

Clever or stupid?

===

White seems to just play out forcing moves without considering what else to do.]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[fd]
(;B[gd]C[N: Respond to contact, hane on the outside.];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[cg];B[ci]C[N: I want to kill this white group.  I feel like he's overplayed with half ladder.

===

You cannot kill if your corner dies. You overplayed before that ladder, he just didn't respond severely.]
;W[bd]C[N: But he kills my corner instead.  Or was it already dead?]
;B[bc]C[N: Just to make some aji];W[be];B[dh]C[N: My hope is that I can make this in sente.]
;W[bh];B[mb]C[N: Now I'm just going for large end game moves.  This is the largest sente sequence I see.

===

Sente? Yes, mostly. Dangerous for white to ignore. But if you saw this was sente, why didn't you punish white for ignoring it instead of S11 later? Rather than think "this should be sente, I hope he responds" think "this should be sente, I hope he doesn't respond, because then I profit huge."]
;W[bi];B[bj]C[N: I read carefully and the cut at C10 doesn't work so I play the hane.

===

This is not worth it.]
(;W[ab];B[ri]C[N: This should also be a sente sequence, even if white is ignoring it.

===

Why was the top sente then? If white ignored it, then punish on the top. This, on the other hand, is not sente per se, it's sente in that it has point value that might be large if white ignores it, but there's nothing on the level of a group dying like on top.]
;W[rj];B[nb]C[N: Also sente since I can cut off the two center stones.]
(;W[oc]C[===

So the reason N18 was somewhat sente, was because white isn't alive yet.]
(;B[fb]C[N: Protect from a monkey jump.  Large gote point.

===

Kill upper right instead, see variations.];W[dj];B[dl]C[N: I misread the very end, but I'm not sure in hindsight how else to handle this move.

Clearly there were too many weaknesses in my position here.]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[di];B[fi]C[N: I realize connected will leave my dead in a net when white plays F11.  Before this I thought he'd have to ladder and I'd be fine since the ladder doesn't work.]
;W[ch];B[ij]C[N: I want to indirectly threaten the white group on top and maybe start connecting my group here to the top and keep white separated.

===

No threat yet, you have to connect at N11 first.];W[mi]C[N: Maybe in hindsight I should have saved these two stones here now instead of J10.  White's snake would be eyeless and I could chase it.]
;B[ig]C[N: Overplay?  Just sort of guessed.  I want to connect my groups, and keep white separated.  I probably won't kill the top group of stones, but I can probably threaten it for profit.]
;W[rg]C[N: Tesuji?

I fell for it

===

No, a silly move, just S12.]

;W[ro]C[N: Gote move by white, so I don't mind responding.]
;B[rp];W[rn];B[fr]C[N: Sente move.  White has to connect or the left is dead, so it's basically free.]

I don't understand this move, white gets a point for the capture, thus white gets a free point. If you had played at G3 instead, at least white doesn't get that point.]

It's a close game, and if white responds correctly it's basically a lost point, and I don't really need to pull out a trick like this, but I want to test my reading skills.]
;W[fe]
(;B[ac]C[N: I need 5 liberties to win this capture race.

I think: "4 eye space = 5 liberties - 1 white stone + 1 external liberty = 5 liberties".  With a throw in at E16 and then squeezing, white doesn't have enough liberties to win the capture race.

But I forget that the big eye in the corner is worth less since white can form his own eye.

===

White has the capturing race. What is that about eyes? Black has 3 liberties, and it doesn't matter that black has an eye. An eye matters when there are shared liberties between groups, becuase the one without eyes cannot fill them, thus an eye wins. Here there are no shared liberties.]

White is about to lose that whole group, and white can't get enough compensation on bottom while M3 is still a little weak.

If you choose to jealously defend];W[no]C[===

White has made shape for his weak group, and has actually reduced you by quite a bit in the process.

Now you're somewhat capped, and white is strong.]

If you resist and split, which I think shows a good though process and spirit, it gets a little hairy, and white might force good results. Also, if splitting is your intention, then there was no need to trade L3 for M6, as that gives white an upper hand in the fight.]

If white goes to save M4 group, the right is almost dead, and the M4 group is still eyeless and running.]

He saves one, you kill the other.];B[ql];W[hp]C[===

White's plan may now be to press you down to build up a big middle moyo, it's his only chance to match your huge lower right and right side. Just look at it, it's very large.]
;B[hq];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[eq];W[fe]C[===

The balance favors black by quite a bit (right side is huge), and black can reduce the left easily. This variation might not happen, but this is the intuition behind white having to deal with two weak groups, and choosing the M4 one to defend.]
;B[hg]C[===

If white invades at H17 later on, black has a few options.]

You mentioned going into the corner, and that's an option. Here's the two main josekis for that:]
;B[cc]

If white wants the wall on the top, splitting black.];B[cb]
;W[ec];B[be]C[===

The idea is that white gets the outside wall, and separates black. Black gets life in the corner, and reduces white's left side. What white now does is dependent on the specific situation. Blocking at B14 is one such option, but white has to be aware of cuts. White taking sente is another option, and there may be other moves too.]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[de]LB[cd:B][df:A]C[===

White has to make sure he can handle a cut at A.];B[cd]C[===

If white can handle it, and black connects to live, white adds a move to fix D14 cut. Black ends in sente.]

White can play here if he doesn't mind black connecting and if the left side is more important.]

The Kobayashi proceeds like so. White usually now approaches at R6. If white were to approach at Q5, he will be pincered, wither with a one space high pincer or a two space high one.]
