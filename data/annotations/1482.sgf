C[The review was requested by Sebastian Hartwig,  Sebastian plays white.

The comments (without leading  -) are made by me.
Both players miss a vital point in the opening (E4). When white get that point, the game is practially decided.
However, in failing to realise that he is in a big lead, Sebastean puts the game at stake on several occasions.

/ Tomas Boman];B[pd]C[RotBart [13k\]: hi
- i ( Sebastian) was white in this game];W[dd];B[pp]
(;W[cp]LB[ep:A][dq:B]C[- i didnt want to play every opening stone on the 4-4-point, so i played c4. Are there opening moves, especially in the corners, which work best together with stones in the other corners?

This move is a little bit in the wrong direction, because BQ3 is exerting influence along the lower side, making a play there large. C3 invites black to approach at E4 (A)

 I Think white D3 (B) is better instead, because it reduces the value of a black play on the lower side. Also, if black  makes a normal approach move at c5/d5 then white has the option to answer with a pincer.

In this position I think C3, D3, E3, (and of course D4) are the "normal" moves.]

(;B[pj]
(;W[jd]C[The lower side is bigger, because of the un finised corner position.
I would play at E3]
(;B[cf]C[Black should take the opportunity and make the approach move at E3 or E4.]
;W[ch]TR[ch]LB[cc:A][ef:B]C[- is there a standard pattern when white pincers here?

Yes, typically, black enters the corner at C17 (A) , but running out at E14 (B) is possible too]

(;B[ef]
(;W[eh]LB[fd:B][ep:A]TR[ch][cp]SQ[cf][ef]C[- this stone holds up the pressure on the two black stones and prepares a box shape together with the marked white stones and a stone at "A". But im not sure what happens if black plays at "B".

This is wrong thinking.  You cannot threaten the  black stones by playing from this side.  As you point out, black  shlould now play B, the same point where you should have played!]

(;B[bd]C[This is a bad move.
It is passive,  and it does not secure life];W[cc]LB[fd:A]C[- can black play at a now?

I don't think so];B[bc];W[fd]C[- to prevent black from playing here.

good!];B[cb]C[- perhaps necessary because black needs two eyes in the corner, but whites comes in forehand now, and can secure his territory.]
;W[db];B[cd];W[dc];B[bb];W[ep]C[- now i have my box shape

And you got the shimare at the same time.  Very large !!!
Black has missed his opportunity to approach here, Now the game looks very promising for white]
;B[dl]C[This looks a bit desperate,  but perhaps it is the best move.]

(;W[ck]C[- i wanted to press black against my corner-group.

This is a bad move.   Don't touch your opponents weak stones ... it only streanghten them
I give two indirect approaches of how to attack this stone]

(;B[cl]C[This is dangerous for black.  He might play at d9 instead, but should probably consider the D8-C9 as kikashi and turn elsewhere for the time beeign]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[el];B[em];W[fl];B[dn];W[cm]C[- i played here  because i didnt want black to get an eye here]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[bl];W[bk]LB[ai:A]C[- this move is necessary because black threatens to invade at "a".

;B[gm];W[gh]C[- while oppressing blacks group i can make a large territory.

A strange move.  It doesn't threaten anyting, and only makes a few points]

(;B[de]C[Not necessarey];W[go];B[in]
(;W[io]C[bad!
White forces black to make a bamboo joint,  and j5 is left in a bad position]
;B[im]
(;W[np]C[too far!

j5 needs help];B[jq]C[Too deep maybe.  If white can press this stone, he might be able to get an attack on the E5-group again]
;W[lq]C[- now i have a very serious question: are there some rules what to do with invasions?
vulnerable points of invading stones etc.?

You should pay attention to cutting points, and weak groops that may end up in double attacks
If you feel that your opponent has invaded too deeply, you can either
1) Try to capture him directly, by a capping play e.g.
2) Try to capture him indirectly, by leaning on some enemy stones
3) chase him in a direction where he already has weak stones, and launch a double attack
4) chase him away, and build power to be used for an attack or invasiion in some other part of the board
4) force him to live small, and build power to be used for an attack or invasiion in some other part of the board
....
or you can face it;  The invasion was not too deep.]

True,  but you have made territory on the upper side.  And black was already strong on the right side. so you should not be dissatisfied]
