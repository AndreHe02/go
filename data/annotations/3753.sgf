AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Mattias> Hi. Every saturday a couple of chineese pros, ex-pros and high dans play against us swedish players at KGS. This was my first game. They play several games at the same time and don't want more than 6 stones hcp. The 1k players also loose with 6 stones so this is an uneven game. I did my best but I resigned in the end.

I want to know what I could have done better. All aspects of the game.
Any blunders? Any good moves?

Hi, I`ll try to give  you some advices, I hope you`ll find them usefull, if you see me on kgs and have some questions about my comments let me know.
Best regards, RoninRo];W[fq]C[Mattias [10k?\]: Hi, I'm Mattias from Stockholm, Sweden.
Mattias [10k?\]: HAve fun :o)];B[jp]C[I think this is too far from f3  at least one line closer will be better, the way you played let white to play elsewhere without worry]
;W[mp];B[nq]C[I don`t like this move, you make white stronger here]
;W[mq];B[jn]C[this is not a good move I think, k4 is not in imediate danger ( you can escape in center at any time or going on the right) and you don`t make any points there, better at p3 or o4]

(;B[op]C[this is not ok, white can`t cut you here, if you are worry about your corner take r3

I made a few variatios there and I don`t see how  it`s posible for white to do something in that corner]
;W[cn];B[dm]C[you play high again on 4th line, this means you want influence in center, but white already have a strong group in center, you don`t seem too concerned about making points.
What did you intended with this move to attack white stone at c6 then why not c6 ?
 If you play c6 white will probably  be forced to jump into the corner  and then you can chose which side to block bottom or left 

Look at the table is move 30 and you played only once on 3 rd line which is for teritory and to make a base for your groups. 
Handicap games are kind of diffrent. In high handicap games you have from the beginning stones for influence (on the 4th line) so no need to play so high.
your first concern should be to grab points and make safe groups, this way white will find very difficult to attack your stones, and if can`t find a target to attack he can`t make more points than you
Now, try to remember, it`s a proverb I think, or a kind of a rule for handicap games which sound like this:
with 6 stones you play 60% defending and 40% attacking, with 7 stones 70% defending and 30% attacking, and so on.]

Mattias> I read it out that I was trapped with no escape out. Maybe that H14 works? But it will be a fight...


this one is very complicated, hard to say. I tryed several moves but it seems to me that you can escape but I`m not sure, you play with a pro and maybe there are better moves for white, maybe a high dan player can help you with this one]

I hope my review will help you somehow :).

I`ll give you another advice: don`t try to kill a weak group too hard, just try to make points while attacking with safe moves.
If you are not playing safe (keep your stones toghether) and that group escape it will be your turn to be chased.]
