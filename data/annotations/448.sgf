What follows is a review - I 'm not fully sure that I've got all the moves
in the right place since I could not load the game into my replay program
for some reason and so had to play it out - and transpose to get the first
play in the upper right.  But I think it is right - at least for the first
50 or so moves.

Since I don't know th strenghth of these players, commentary is hard to
pitch at the right level.  I hope this helps.

W6 is probably the wrong direction since it invites a one-move
pincer-extension by black around r11 or r12.  But it may be ok since the
stone on r12 would be too far to be a good extension and one on r11 is not
much of a pincer.

Nonetheless, I think B7 should be a pincer of some sort - I would opt for
around r13 because neither r11 nor r12 is fully dual purpose.  W would
probably jump to p 15 and then b could play simply at n17 or o17.  I really
like the pincer in this situation.

w10 seems low but maybe ok.

B11 probably should approach from the other side because of W10 being an
-already in place pincer.

W 12 is a bit clumsy - helping b build a wall - but it is ok since w10 is
in place already - though a move to push b toward the corner and
immediately stablize w10 makes sense here.

B13 should be at w14 - looking out into the center.  If w draws back, then
b turns and has a perfect formation.  If w runs along the third line toward
b7, b is content to build huge strength on the outside  - and still have
the corner invasion under w4 available.

w14 is consistent with w12.  B should build the wall with b 15 at  ga15
(extending the two stones toward the center) if wh plays again at f 15,
then w is seriously overconcentrated in the corner.  Then b could play at
W16 and have a fine formation on the upper side.

W16 is poorly timed and badly placed.  But b17 is from the wrong direction.
B should pressure from the other side - chasing w toward the two stone wall
while taking points.  Since w will be weak there, b11 and b13 and B15
should be in no serious danger right away.

If b is going to respond to w 16 from this side, a bend around is called
for -  k15.

W18 is ok, but w should still slide into the corner first from the other side.

B19 is appropriate.  I would have played w20 a bit  looser, more flexibly,
say at k14 or m15.

B21 is ok - but it takes away any good attack against the two white stones.
B23 splitting the two white groups feels exactly right here.

The next fight in the corner is not well handled by either side.  Though
there are two many variations to really make many concrete suggestions,
perhaps a couple of points would help here.

W24 was not a good peep.  W should solidify the side group first - the top
group (w20, 18, 16) can run to the center and is in no particular danger -
especially since the b group is also heavy.  So w24 was wrong.

B25 was wrong as well.  B should either simply connect at w30, or look to
see if another pattern works better such as b at either w36 or b31.   I
think the solid connection is best here.

B35 - why not simply connect here?  Keep w separated and b connected and
not confined to corner.

w38 should cut  and play the ko.  Can't hurt w here.

B39 is not the best move here - it results in making an empty triangle for
no good reason.  Pressing w at n14 and then making shape at n12 is  better.

W44 I  don't understand.  - sliding along to s10 makes things simpler and
takes more points, I think.

B45 connecting is a bit heavy too.  W can't cut there - b45 at r11 makes
more sense - and threatens the life of the w group.

I think b55 was not so good - but after w connects, b must see to the
corner and so is likely to lose b55.  (w option)

After w 60, b61 is far from the largest move on the board.   step back and
just look where there are no stones.  B61 induces w to live and then to
attack the b corner group.  B 61 should settle the corner group.  since w
plays 62, b must settle the corner with b63.  w64 is a good move, though
there are other ways to attack the corner here - placement at s18, play at
s17, bendaround at t17 - all should kill the corner.

As a result of the goings on in the upper right, w has a big corner, b has
good potential on the lower right and impressive outside thickness.
Therefore b must play high to keep w low and to use that thickness.
Instead, b plays low with 65, 67, and 69 giving w 68 and 70 -low, but
solid.  After 68, it will be hard for b to use the thickness to attack any
w stones and it is hard to build territory from thickness if one cannot
attack.

With 71 b must try to use the massive thickness and so should play around
k4 - before w plays 72.  w72 should be at o4 or p5.  b73 in respons is ok.
w74 is not the best.  W should attach below 73 or attach 5 on the side or
top or something bigger than 74.

The following fight should have been handled better by b - let w live small
- especially once w is alive with the potential move of o6 -if I've played
it out right.  b should get more points in sente here and build another
outside wall to take more points in the middle and side - then only worry
about upper left.

w124 was a rather serious error - as was b123.  after 123 w should just cut
ahd escape that way - while reducing.

I don't have time to go through more.

In general, both sides need to work more on hand-to-hand combate skills,
but, even more importantly, look at the board a bit larger and see the
effect of one fight on other stones.
