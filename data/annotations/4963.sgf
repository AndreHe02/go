C[Hello.

This is a tournament game of mine, I'm playing black.

Reviewer.
Hi. I would like to comment on the stand of black.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[ed]LB[cd:B][fq:A]C[An opening principle says that shimari making/disrupting moves are very big, perhaps even the biggest moves.

But yet, I dislike playing under the takamoku too soon, so I played A instead. I don't want to take the corner in gote, see variation. I'd rather give all the corners to white and grab a huge center moyo, which for some reason happens very often in my games.

R.: There are many options in a game,  therefore your thinking is a good option.]

(;B[fq]C[R:This  move is  popular one.];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[fp]C[This is the only exception to the rule stated before. White played perhaps too conservative, but lets face it, if white doesn't play anything to the bottom black can easily erase pretty much everything from it.
R.: I also think that white is conservative,
   but  no too bad.];B[nc]LB[nc:C][cd:D][pj:B][nq:A]C[I though I had 4 choices from A to D.

R: B and C are almost the same effectiveness, D is somewhat inferior and A is inferior. 
However, there are not big differences among them.
 
Basicly I didn't want to play B because I don't feel good with sanrensei, it feels hard to make use of.

R:
My style is somewhat influence orientated, so I dislike giving my opponent thickness, this was enough good of a reason not to play D.

Also I felt that A wouldn't be too effective because of the white wall, so I chose the more open top side.]
;W[qn]LB[qj:B][nq:A]C[What do you think of this move? I had rough time choosing a correct strategy.

R: Also I think that B direction is good. 

I didn't want to answer to A, see variation.]
(;B[qj]C[So I pincered.];W[nq]LB[oo:B][np:A]C[I think I made a wrong decision here, I chose to play the A joseki and ended up giving a nice bottom for white.

Upon personal reviewing I considered play B instead, see variation.]

(;B[np];W[mp];B[oq];W[no];B[op];W[mq];B[pn];W[pk]C[This was a peculiar move, a thank you -one, I guess?]
;B[qm];W[qk]LB[nn:A][qo:B]
(;B[nn];W[mo];B[qo];W[pj]LB[cd:B]C[I didn't really consider this move much, A was pretty self-evident because of the follow-up at R12, not to mention white playing R14 himself. But would B be bigger?
R.:white  three stones are not living, therefore b is not bigger.

I still don't feel comfortable with takamoku, as it pretty much ruins my style. I have already taken 3 corners and I for sure don't want to take the 4th one as well. And in gote.]
;B[qe];W[cd]
(;B[cj]C[R.: this move is not big,  branch 38 is vital point of the contact.]

(;W[jc];B[cc];W[dc];B[bd];W[ce];B[dn];W[fn]
(;B[qh];W[qi];B[rj]C[Idea was to make whites shape a cyclops.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[ph];B[pg];W[og];B[si];W[pi];B[pf]C[White answered pretty well I suppose. It didn't get a single eye, but a shape which is pretty hard to attack against.
Now blackshape are not good.];W[dk]
(;B[ck];W[dl];B[bm];W[be]LB[hc:A][ng:B]C[I felt very alarmed now. I'm counting that the positions are equal in terms of territory. But white has much better prospects for further development as I don't have anything lef to develop.

I had to try something.

I had two options. To invade at A, or to attack at B. I didn't feel too good with A yet, as there was little black influence near by. It would have probably ended up very badly for black.

So I had to try for the B.];B[ng]C[I was hoping that I would gain some influence by attacking the eyeless group to the right, and with that influence invade the top.]
;W[je]C[Ok. Plan "Invade the top" had pretty much foiled. But if I manage to ruin all whites prospects to the center I still might have a chance to win.]
;B[nl];W[mi];B[lg];W[lj];B[ll];W[kn];B[jj];W[ji];B[jg];W[kj]
;B[km];W[jn]LB[hd:B]C[I played A, but now looking at this I'm thinking I may have been a bit soft? As B seems a bit more severe.]

I even managed to reduce the bottom a bit.];B[go];W[gp];B[hn]

(;B[kb]C[R.:This one-space jump is too thin.];W[lb];B[la];W[mc]
;B[nb];W[kc]LB[md:A][mf:C][bi:B]C[Here I made a stupid overlook which eventually cost the game.

I played B, but I suppose A is pretty much equal in points. And as well defends against white C.
R.:A is a good defend move,  but   now white stones are strong and winning of the black side became difficult.]

(;B[oo];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]C[I don't want white to play O5 and recieve a nice bottom, so I have to force it somehow.]
;B[np]LB[pm:B][mq:A]C[Is there a reason this move wouldn't work?
If white jumps out at Q7 or something black can attack it from the top and build something to the right side.]

;B[qq];W[qk]LB[kq:A][rq:B]C[Here I would have to defend at A or B, or otherwise white will be very happy to play one of those moves, which makes my lower side pretty pathetic.

And by defending I end up in gote, which isn't nice either.]
