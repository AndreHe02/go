WL[1113];B[rr]BL[1064];W[sp]WL[1091];B[qj]C[Here a move in the corner is also larger. The white stones are imune to attacks.]

(;B[ed]C[This move neither takes territory in the corner nor developed along the upper edge.

WL[957];B[jd]BL[800];W[gq]WL[935];B[ck]C[Good move. Black can soon get a base here.]

(;B[kq]C[Here Black helps white ...]BL[673];W[qh]LB[jp:A][kr:B]C[... but attaching moves should be answered (at A or B)]
WL[851];B[oj]BL[632];W[oh]WL[848];B[ri]LB[mh:A]C[This is an endgame move. It does not really help black. If white jumps out to A he also is
almost imune to attacks.]BL[549];W[rh]LB[mh:A][qf:B]C[That's why the block here is not good. Better at A or B to attack the corner.]
WL[837];B[rm]BL[546];W[nd]C[White has a weak group. Now he starts to create another. This helps black to gain  while attacking.]

white.]WL[700];B[qe]BL[317];W[kc]WL[653];B[kd]BL[302];W[pb]LB[ob:A]C[Suddenly black is the one who has the weakest group there]

;B[re]BL[664];W[sh]WL[488];B[rc]BL[572];W[ra]WL[465];B[sd]C[now black is just alive in a corner he was once very strong. this result is excelent for white

If Black plays A now a fight comes up where white can lose much more than he can gain.
Counting shows that white is leading, so keeping the game simple should do it.]
WL[116];B[lr]LB[lq:A][jp:B]C[this move does not do any good to black. Either black should take the territory with A or
fight with B. As he is behind with territory I think he should fight, because he has nothing
to lose. This way he just helps white to secure his territory]BL[15];W[kr]

he also pushed black in the dirction he wants to get territory. That's not good]

BL[754];W[fh]LB[hm:A]C[White should better secure territory at the lower side (e.g. at A) If black playes A
here he can destroy much more than white can built with the move he did.]
WL[699];B[gk]LB[hm:A]TR[fk][kn]C[Reducing at A is better here. It has 2 directions to connect (to the marked stones) with his allies and reduces much more than this move does.]

now. Better a point near the edge]BL[276];W[jj]WL[408];B[ii]C[black and white are here securing single points in the middle. The edge is larger.]
