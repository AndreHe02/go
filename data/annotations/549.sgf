C[Jan:

Because you expressed particular interest in "the opening" and because of my own time limitations, I have commented only on the first 81 moves of this game.

At the same time, there were a sufficient number of significant points highlighted that I believe even this should be quite illuminating and useful for you.

One caveat: A stronger player than I am might have found some better fuseki moves, but I believe that overall my comments are appropriate.

Moves not commented on are OK as played.

Milton N. Bradley];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[hq]C[B9. Impatient! Both sides have played perfectly to this point, so B should simply make the "standard" 2 point skip on the third line  to C9 and wait to see what W does in response. It's also possible for B to play at D10, but this does leave the bad Aji of the invasion at C8 for later, as I'm sure that you well know.]
;W[cl]C[W10. An overplay, and too much in a hurry to punish B for his gaffe. Better to simply squeeze B9  at  K3 to begin building moyo on the lower right.. Now W also has a weak stone to watch out for!]
;B[en];W[el];B[gn];W[hp]C[W14. Now unfortunately necessary, and this is not bad for B.]
;B[ip];W[ho];B[gr]C[B17. A nice move! Good shape, and looks at continuing at E3 next if that opportunity presents itself. Of course if this stone were played at G3 instead, the W response of F5 would leave B in Gote.]
;W[fr]C[W18. Although this leaves a lot of bad Aji, it's hard for a player at  my modest level to find a much better move. At E2 is safer, but not as strong.]
;B[eo]C[B19. Although this clearly strengthens the connection between B's one-point-skip stones, it's rather slow.  Instead, B might better avail himself of the opportunity presented him by W to play immediately at W's key shape point of E3. It's also not bad to simply use the power of B3 to squeeze the weak W10,12 stones at C10 and simply leave the bad Aji in this corner for possible later exploitation.]
;W[gq]C[W20. Simply connecting at E4 is what B expected, but this is far more aggressive! Seizes Sente!]
;B[hr]C[B21.  The necessity for this strictly defensive play demonstrates that B19 was a mistake.]
;W[dh]C[W22. Logical. W now stands clearly better (already!).]
;B[eq]C[B23. This is what B played for, but it's clearly not enough so it is far better left as Aji for (probably much) later.]
;W[ep]C[W24. Essential.];B[er]C[B25. An admission that B19 was an error, because B really can't hurt W too badly here! But if that's true then following this sequence now no matter what is clearly a mistake!]
;W[fq];B[fs]C[B27. With this additional bad play, B has already invested 7 stones in this area with absolutely nothing of substance to show for it! So saving these 2 stones (in Gote!!) is clearly unproductive. Far better would be to play O3 now and leave the 2 stones behind as Aji, since W can only capture them in Gote anyway. Even B3 is better than the text .]
;W[ds]C[W28. Just because B plays weakly doesn't mean that W must do the same! Best here is to play B3 to gain eyespace and prevent it for the weak B left side group. If W is mistakenly going to attempt to attack the lower side group as he actually does, then the pitch at G1 should be played  first!  This would force B to capture or (far better!) abandon B23,25,27, else W follows with the nasty cut at J3 next.

But far better than doing this latter, the peep at K3 followed by N3 is also very nice for W.]
;B[es]C[B29. A serious error on several counts! Not only are the 2 B stones almost worthless, saving them in Gote still leaves the lower side B group eyeless and shapeless! Connecting at G1 is at least marginally better than the text because then W has no followup in this corner other than playing at B3 which is interesting at this early stage of the game. after this bad play W gets to correct his error. Instead, B should play O3,  combining an extension and Kakari. Even the simple K3 to secure 1 eye with good shape is far better than the text.]
;W[bq]C[W30.  Good!  Assures at least 1 eye and most probably 2, while preventing an easy eye here for B. It also threatens to follow at B5 at the appropriate moment to capture B7.]
;B[cp]C[B31. Bad! Small and slow. Now is the time for B to combine an extension and kakari at O3, to begin to make use of his lower side stones. If B does play locally, though, at B6 is far superior to the text.]
;W[do]C[W32. Good! Not only steals B's key shape point for this group, but it's also Sente because of the threat to push through at D6.]
;B[dn];W[co]C[W34. Inferior, although as played it does result in no eye for B and W's Sente, but B could have played much better, as shown next.  Best for W is to play this move at B7, because with this group so weak he really has no choice but to do something to strengthen it immediately.]
;B[bo]C[B35. The "obvious" response, but wrong despite that!!! Correct is to play on the key point of B7 and not worry about the 2 B stones. If W then foolishly plays at 35 to capture them, B has the nasty inner peep at D9 to induce W@D8, then B@B9 to destroy the W territory above and leave teh W stones not yet secure.

Of course if W defends against this nasty threat, B can then continue at 35 with one secure eye.

This is the reason that W34 should have been played at B7!]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[dr]C[W38. If this was played to assure W eyespace in the corner it's OK, but from what follows it appears that W's prime concern is with capturing the 4 B stones, and that's a mistake!   The 4 stones are unimportant structurally, so capturing them is worth only 8 points, and still requires another move to assure and 2 more to complete!  Certainly far too little payoff to be played in the Fuseki, where each move is worth (by some estimates) as much as 16 points! Exactly what a move at this stage of this game is worth I'm not sure, but if we conservatively hypothesize 8 points then W is losing 16 points here by using 3 stones to capture this B 4!]
;B[go]C[B39. Aji keshi at best! The connection to B13 doesn't need strenghtening at this time, and all that this accomplishes is to force W to connect. Because B15 is so weak B can't try to enclose W at K6, and this move has no other feasible purpose at this juncture. Instead,  O3 now is called for because W can't successfully enclose the left side group so B need not run out with it immediately.]
;W[gs]C[W40. A huge error, as already noted!!! No longer profitable because the 4 stones aren't worth saving or capturing at this stage of the game. Better to simply connect at G4 to prevent the corner from becoming enclosed (even though it is easily alive via W @ B1 even if enclosed), mainly because it serves to keep the 2 weak B groups separated.]
;B[hs]C[B41. Very Bad!! Dancing to W's tune and a BIG compensating mistake which doesn't punish W's error on his last move!!!!   Correct is to cut at G4  to separate W14,16 and threaten to capture them in Geta or a ladder, and connecting and making secure both  of the now weak B groups and making it urgent for W to do something with W14, 16. Another not as attractive option for B is to simply make a "tiger's mouth" at K3.   In any event B should forget about the 4 stones for now, especially since with the cut at J3 available to W they can't be saved until that cut is defended in any event!]
;W[dq]C[W42. Very Bad! Obsessed with 4 essentialy worthless stones! Instead, W should simply connect at G4 as noted before.]
;B[jq]C[B43. The right idea structurally, but badly timed! Correct is to cut at G4 as noted above, then follow with this.

In any event this hanging connection is made more than a little late! Now that it has become obvious, B correctly "forgets" about the 4 stones and occupies the key shape point of his formation. He could also consider the extension/kakari at O3 instead, since until they're connected the potential weakness of W14, 16 can be used to help the B lower side stones if needed.]
;W[gp]C[W44. Regrettably necessary, and better late than never.]
;B[im]C[B45. Since W is alive in the corner in any event and already has some territory while B as yet doesn't even have firm prospects for making any,  this enclosing attempt has no real meaning, even if it worked - which it does NOT!

B already has a very bad game because he saddled himslf with 2 weak groups, so he realistically can't expect anything good now, and what's urgent is obviously his left side group. Although B45 does help it somewhat, much more prudent would be to simply jump to G8.

Although even if this move is omitted  W can't enclose the eyeless B left side group with a move like H8, so B could instead make the extension Kakari at O3 to make some territory in Sente (sooner or later, since B must first  respond there any time that W interjects a move which threatens the weak B left side group.). The problem with doing this, of course, is that W WILL attack the weak B left side group and profit enormously in the ensuing running battle, in which he will have all of the options while B just struggles to live.

So, as noted, on balance B's ONLY feasible move now is the jump to G8.]
;W[hn]C[W46. Slow, crude, and unsophisticated! Since W is already alive in the corner, he could better instead attach to B45 at J6 and then cut! With 2 unsettled B groups against his already secure corner group and almost certainly secure left side group, this fight should strongly favor W!  Alternatively, the extension to N3 makes territory while reducing B's potential.]
;B[gm]C[B47. Equally crude (and slow, in addition)! The jump to G8 is clearly superior, and even the attachment at F8 is better despite its inducing the strengthening of the W10,12 group.]
;W[hm]C[W48. Again unsophisticated and slow, doing little for W while inducing B to further strengthen his weak group.  Correct is the tesuji jump to K5!! Then if B attempts to cut this stone off via J5, there will follow W@ J6, and then if B@ K6, W ataris @K7. Then if B extends to L7, the atari of W48 on B45 can't be defended because B must get his weak left side group out!]
;B[gl]C[B49. Same error as B47! Here, the jump to G9 is correct shape.]
;W[hl]C[W50. Ditto! Now, once again the key play is for W to make the tesuji jump to K5!! Then, just as before, because of the weakness of B45 he's out without further strengthening the weak B left side group. (If B@J5, W@J6, and if B tries to block @K6, W@K7 is double atari!)  The jump to K5 is also good because it occupies a key B shape point.]
;B[gk]C[B51. Something here is necessary, but this is (again) too slow and uninspired! At F9 is more versatile, aiming at both the left and upper sides and, of course, the skip to G10 is the "standard" way to proceed.]
;W[fj]C[W52. Good! Enclosing potential territory in Sente, and protecting W's still thin formation here.]
;B[hk]C[B53. OK, but at H10 is more flexible.];W[il]C[W54. Pedestrian! Once again the tesuji jump to K5 is called for.]
;B[ik]C[B55. Really slow and bad!!!!! Since W is already assured of life in the corner and B's ability to connect his 2 groups is now effectively zero and his weak left side group is no longer in imminent danger of becoming enclosed,  this move serves no useful purpose!! Instead, B @O3 now is urgent to make some territory in Sente. In any event, IF B were to continue with these stones (and he shouldn't now), a jump to H12 would be the correct way to play.]
;W[jk]C[W56. Once again, fails to take advantage of the big opportunity presented by B's weak play!  Since the weak B group is now safely out, this isn't very productive. Instead, at M3 now gives B real problems!]
;B[jl]C[B57-W64. All in pursuit of the wrong objectives, as already indicated.]
;W[jm];B[kl];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[jj]C[B63. Locally good, but globally bad!  Instead, with W60, 62 preventing B's egress to the center B must now do something with his lower side stones!]
;W[lm]C[W64. VERY BAD on two major counts!!   - Most important, the attack on the Weak B lower side group via  M3 now is Sente, and a winning move!   - The cutting stone W56 has very valuable Aji which W should try to husband carefully until it can be profitably exploited. Instead, the text induces B to capture it for essentially no gain to W.]
;B[ll]C[B65. Almost equally bad! Once again, B justifies a W error by making a compensating one of his own. Correct is to remove the dangerous Aji of W56 by just capturing it! This would instantly give B an eye while making him thick, allowing him to play aggressively on the upper and right sides of the board - an enormous shift in the strategic values on the board and going far toward putting B back in the game.]
;W[lq]C[W66. At very long last!!! But W was just lucky to be able to play here because his opponent played so badly.]
;B[lp]C[B67. Better at M2.];W[mp];B[lr]C[B69. OK.];W[kp]C[W70. Bad!!! Must be at N2 to make territory on the lower side. B67 is structurally meaningless, so this move gives back to B much of the gain that W acquired through playing W66 in Sente.]
;B[lo]C[B71. Equally bad!! Another error, saving a meaningless stone. Instead, N2 is correct.]
;W[kq]C[W72. Of course!];B[kr];W[mr]C[W74. Once again, W gets a favorable result he hasn't earned!]
;B[ko]C[B75. Unproductive, Aji keshi, and will probably only result in giving W another prisoner. Correct is for B to simply make life via J2, and leave the 2 stones as they are.]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[mq];B[ir];W[ml]C[W80. Terrible!!! Same error as W64. Far better not to induce B to capture the cutting stone W56. Since the 3 B stones are weak, have no good prospects, and are structurally irrelevant, they should be ignored for now.   Instead of the text, one possibility for W would have been to play E14 to consolidate a large left side territory while attacking B3, and after B's response in the upper left play R14, moving smoothly ahead to an effortless victory.]
