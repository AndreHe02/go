C[It would be simpler at this point just to keep going at P17. If white follows at P16, then black can invade around R10 or Q10. Then black still has the corner.]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[rd];W[lc];B[pe];W[pb];B[qi]
LB[qj:a][qk:b]C[This extension is a bit too narrow, compared to the size of black's wall. A move to R10 or R9 still does not leave white much room to invade behind it. As it is now, white R8 or R9 is still pretty large.]
;W[qb];B[qe];W[md];B[hc];W[qm];B[cj];W[cm];B[nq]LB[lq:a][kq:b]
[jp:c]C[Here black must do something about the deep moyo that white is developing. In a symmetric situation like this, I like to move right in the middle (K3 or K4). With O3, white can respond with a squeeze (M3, L3, K4) and try to build up a large te
rritory on the other side. But with the bottom still so open, move could work.]
;W[np];B[pq]LB[qq:a][mp:b]C[Typically this move is either at R3 to take the corner, or N4 to make a position on the outside. Q3 is sort of in between. I like N4 better, since if white gets to play around there, he gets a large Moyo facing his D4 star point stone. Any wall he
 makes facing R7 is a little too close, and nullified by R11 and black's wall in the upper right.]
;W[qq];B[op];W[oo];B[oq];W[po];B[mp];W[no];B[kq]LB[jq:a][kp:b]
C[Black eventually gets the outside anyway. L3 is a bit narrow at this point. I would like to reach to K3, or play on the 4th line at L4.]
;W[mo];B[gq]C[If L3 were at L4 or K3, black can play simple and defend N5 at M4. If white continues to push, just march down the fourth line one or two more time, then extend all the way to F3. This would make territory, and pressure the lower left corner.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[ip];B[iq];W[hp];B[hq];W[gp];B[eq]
LB[dq:a][cq:b]C[E3 almost forces white to close his corner and take a large profit. Avoid forcing your opponent to make moves they want to. Either attach at D3, or slide all the way to D2 or C3. Any of these moves could either reach beck to the bottom group, or l
ive in the corner.];W[dq];B[fp];W[jp];B[fo]LB[ko:a]C[Good. At least you stuck you head out into the center. You could also kakari (force) at L5, and leave white with a bothersome black piece next to his wall.]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[kp];B[je]LB[jc:a][ej:b][ch:c]C[This move does not seem to be doing anything useful. It enlarges the moyo a bit, but white can still come in at K3 and almost force black to answer immediately. Expanding at E10 looks better at the moment, since white can cause trouble by invading
 around C12];W[lr];B[kr];W[nr];B[mp];W[jc];B[mq];W[lm]LB[id:a]
[he:b]C[This looks a bit too slow for white. He could have caused some real trouble by playing around J16 or G15.]
;B[dh]C[See comment a few moved ago. I like E10 better in this position.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[hd];W[ie];B[he];W[fg];B[fi]LB[fe:a]C[It's going to be hard to capture F13 at this point. Perhaps in this position it would be better to just play F15 and seal off you position. White is almost forced to still run, or else black H12 would be real trouble.   Also, if you can chase white into the center, you hopefully can lessen the influence of his wall on the lower side.]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[if];B[hf];W[hh];B[jf];W[ig];B[jg]LB[me:a]C[K13 may have been a move that was just 'going with the flow'. But it does not do anything except make the K15 group heavier. You could try a move like N15, pretending to save the stones, but instead make a nice overhang above R11.

Another simple move would be to just play P11 right now.];W[jh]
;B[lg];W[kh];B[lf];W[kg];B[kf];W[lh];B[nf];W[mh];B[oi];W[oh]
C[By this time, the K15 group had so many stones, black almost has to save it. By the time it is safe and black plays P11, white is close enough to come walking in.]
;B[ph];W[og];B[pg];W[of];B[oe];W[mg];B[mf];W[me];B[ne];W[pj]
;B[pi]C[Now white has some forcing moves and uses them to make territory. Black now has a hard time getting into white's area, but he does have a toehold.]

;W[om];B[mn];W[ln];B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[qn];B[kk]LB[fe:a]C[Black makes a nice dent in white's territory, but may have forgotten his own. L9 is not such a big point, considering how open it is neat H8. Black should probably play around F15 now instead, as white will do next.]
;W[fe];B[fd];W[de];B[dd]LB[cf:a]C[A stronger move would be C14 here. It may have prevented black's losing the corner.]

;W[ej];B[ei];W[bk];B[ck];W[bj];B[bi];W[cl];B[do]C[Fake in one direction, then go another. D2 before D5 would let black bend around a little further near D5.
Picture b-D2, w-C2, b-D5, w-C5, b-C4, w-C3, b-C6, etc...];W[co]
;B[ep]LB[dr:a][qr:b]C[Better here to bend around at D2, since there is no points to be had above E5. Another better move at this point would be R2, which white eventually takes.]

;W[jm];B[km];W[kn];B[ll];W[cb];B[bb];W[rb];B[sc];W[pf];B[qf]
;W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[en];W[em]LB[fm:a]C[white makes mistake here and gives black two points. F7 would end the issue in this area immediately.]

;B[ai];W[dj];B[ci];W[ak];B[ds];W[cs];B[cr];C[White lost on time.
But white was pretty far ahead with the dead G19 group.

Advice for black: In the endgame, try to look for the biggest point on the entire board, instead of following the local action to its end. Somtimes giving up a point or two in one area is ok if you get 5 or 6 back elsewhere. The E5 vs R2 exchange is an ex
ample.

Black plays well, but at times seems a bit tenative. Many moves that  were criticized were definitely in the right direction, but just not bold enough.]
