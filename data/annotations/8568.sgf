;B[nk]C[First bad move. If it's not connected to q11, what's it doing? If q11 lives, how can o9 do well? And vice-verse.]
;W[oj]C[Of course.];B[nh]C[Okay, given the situation you've put yourself in, trying to save q11 is probably the right direction. But - especially in a handicap game - you don't want to be getting into this kind of fight. p14/r14 have so many options right now.]

;W[ok]C[The exchange of q10 for p9 doesn't do anything for you. Best not to make forcing moves unless you have a specific reason (profit, for example, or fixing weakness in sente).]
;B[jn]C[This isn't right. What are you trying to do? Reduce White's moyo? It's not the right way. The rest of the board isn't settled. This is going to cost you. White can play something like j6, making a weak black group with nowhere to run, and at the same time building up influence with which to obliterate any chance of Black territory on the left.

Instead, you should play like g4 to reduce, and at the same time take territory and build strength.]
;W[gp]C[This is also reasonable for White. I guess he thinks at this point he can play more simply and still win.]
;B[lk]C[I still don't think it's time for you to get desperate. It doesn't make sense to try to save o9 - a single stone is worth only one point. Saving this stone has no strategic significance. White is still alive and strong.]

(;B[lm]C[Just capture the stone.];W[nn];B[fd];W[dj]C[See how weak d4 is now. This is an error in the direction of play. Much better to have a black stone at g4.]
;B[cl]C[This is overreaching. White should play c6 here. He is strong enough to attack.]
;W[cq]C[White opts for a simpler game again. That's odd, normally in handicap games Black tries to make it simply, White tries to make it complex.]
;B[dq]C[And now you make it complex again. This move should be at c4. White will live at both sides here. You can't change that, but c4 would at least let you strengthen your group.]
;W[cp];B[do]C[You have no base.];W[dr];B[fq]C[played with the intention of getting some thickness to later attack c14-d10, but it didnt work out; normal e2 better i suppose

Yes.];W[er];B[gq]C[Better to get some base with c5];W[co];B[dn]
;W[hn]
(;B[fp];W[hq];B[hm]C[This is the wrong direction again. White can play to make h7 connect to the already strong group on the right, while gaining thickness to kill the weak group on the left.]

It just doesn't do anything. Were you worried about the group on the right living?!]

(;B[ki]C[purely defence - was there a better play?

Defence of what? Yes, you should be attacking now. d10 and c14 should be your target.]
;W[mh];B[nf];W[kh];B[jh];W[kg];B[jc]C[wrong direction?  is left side more urgent?

Yes. So is the corner. I think even c15 would be decent. It wold take the corner.]

Ah, so you'e a chess player. But there's rarely such big threats in go. It couldn't work here. I'll show in a variation.]

Yes, it's a good forcing move. But I still think you end up back here.]

C[kishine305 [1k\]: thx
myopian [3k\]: ty
myopian [3k\]: any suggestions for me?

Okay, not a bad game. White kept letting you get away. He played safe and didn't punish you where he should. He let you get away with things you shouldn't have.

Moves where you created weak groups, defended the wrong group, or neglected to strengthen your weak group:

22 O9
36 K6
38 M9
56 C8
58 D3
62 F3
64 G3
70 H7
74 J9

Sorry, this was a pretty short review. If you have any questions about anything I've raised, or if anything I've said didn't make sense, please email me and we can discuss the game further.]
