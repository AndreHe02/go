(;W[ci]C[please see variation for other possibility for white.]
;B[dh];W[bh];B[bi]
(;W[eh]C[please see variation.  looks like white could have taken advantage starting with b14.  maybe starting at c17 instead of b14 works too.]
;B[ah];W[di];B[ge]C[I don't know why black do this as well. Probably should play in some other places?]
;W[ff];B[nq];W[bh];B[ch]C[Maybe black doesn't need to answer this?.]
;W[fb];B[fq]C[looks like black g15 followed by white f14 makes the h17 white stones an attackable group .   So, instead of white f18, how about h14 and keep the h17 white stones safe ?  For black's part, if playing g15, maybe don't then turn away at o3.  If you want to play o3 for black , then maybe don't play g15 first.]
;W[ec]C[once black ignores white f18, then white always has either e17 or h14, so I suggest white not play e17 now at all but instead take a bigger point elsewhere.]
;B[db]C[white and black stones in this corner are now both completely safe so black d18 seems small.]
;W[hf]C[no longer important at all since h17 stones are safe.]
;B[fo];W[ep]C[Black should connect?

yes, i think so, to preserve moyo possibility.];B[nc];W[qd]
C[I wonder what's white trying to do here too. Trying to take my corner? So I thought of giving white the corner and to build a wall outside.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[pc]C[maybe q14 better than q17, since then white s15 can be nicely answered at s14 .]
;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qb];W[rb];B[qg];W[rg];B[kc]C[this L17 point for either player increases profit by only a small amount, but the difference between white playing f4 and black playing f4 seems much larger.]
;W[qh];B[og]C[why not answer r12 at q12 instead of p13 ?];W[ph]
;B[qn]C[maybe r6 should be at r5 instead since it makes it impossible to invade at r3.  maybe still ko if r3 invasion now.  r6 would be more useful if there was territory being made at r8 area bug the white r12 stone makes that not as much of a possibility.]
;W[lq];B[jq];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[ip];W[eq]C[right here, perhaps is the time for white to run with the m3 stone, since black is poised with q10, o3, j4 to attack it and make big profit.

so maybe white L4 or M5 instead of E3];B[bk]C[Maybe black should concentrate on attacking M3 stones?]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[cm];B[jm];W[lo];B[jo];W[fm]C[this white f7 will be small if black captures m3 and m5 .  If such a capture is a danger then instead of white f7 white should make some sort of shape with the m5 stones.  jump out to m7 ?]
;B[lm];W[kn];B[jn]C[how did black decide to play k6 instead of L7 ?  Note that if black plays L7 and white pushes at K6 and black blocks at J6, white can't cut at J5 due to black atari at G6 .]
;W[km];B[kl];W[np]C[I don't  know how to answer this move.]

(;B[ln]C[black should be thinking about attacking all the white stones.  If white gets to play p3, black let the big fish get away.  I would consider black p3 instead of M6 .

please see variation.];W[oq];B[mo];W[mp];B[pq];W[or];B[kp];W[oo]
;B[po];W[mn]C[Probably some wrong sequence. That's why white get to run away?]
;B[ko];W[kr];B[lp]C[black didn't get much.

(;W[ee];B[ec]C[I don't like the black c12 move due to this possibility.  Now white is threatening cuts at c17, b14, and b12, with the danger that white may either capture c12 in a little ladder (which ends at d10) or capture the c16 stones, or capture the d17 ones.

Please study whether white should play at b12, b14, or c17 first.]

(;W[ee];B[ec];W[cf]C[this variation seems to keep black confined to corner and give white better outside influence, and threatens a cut at the 3-3 point.]
