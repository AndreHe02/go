;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[qp];B[nc];W[pf];B[kc];W[jp]C[I like this formation. (moves 4 & 8)

Generally I think that K4 is one line too far (because for instance P3-M3 is space for a comfortable
ither into the corner or toward the outside.

Also Usually white would exchange P17/O16 (compare this to if black exchanged Q18/R17).  It makes black a little overconcentrated on the outside.  However with white playing a moyo style it might be better to play as you have, not giving black thickness at the top.]
;B[gq]C[This move seems slow to me.
P4 or P3 looks better.
But if white now plays on the  left side around C10, then black gets to play P3/4 as an attack on the K4 stone (M3/4 look playable too with the support of the G3 stone)]
;W[cj]C[Black could now play C12, WC7, black C5, but then white keeps sente to play P3.   I think black invading on the
lower side is most urgent.];B[cg]C[Since C13 doesn't close the corner, I think C12 would be better as a severer pressure on white's C10 stone.]
;W[cn]C[C6 looks dangerous; white is weak on the left side.  If white wants to make a good moyo, white's groups need to stay strong.]
;B[qh]C[What should I do here?

If you had played P3 instead of C10, now it would be clear; play R10 and use the Q16/14 stones to attack.

As things stand, white looks thin everywhere so can't attack very hard.  P13 might be sensible.  Or you could use M16 followed by O16 to build some thickness by leaning against theupper side, then try Q10.]
;W[qg]C[Is moving out better than this? The black groups aren't weak so I figured this was better.

I think moving out is better.  Here you strengthen black and your corner group can still be attacked later.

Here you will probably get into a complicated fight.];B[ph]
;W[pk]C[Is there a better attack? Just to make him run...

Yes, this is probably reasonable.
Leaning on the upper side group to get some thickness first would be helpful.

The problem is that as black runs out, the invasions at C8 and in the lower right start to look better for black.]
;B[pb]C[Q18 is a little too passive for black!  He should jump out first to O12 or thereabouts.  Also he can think about R17 because the R15 peep also threatens to link up to R12.  In any case the lower right seems more urgent.

On the other hand, now the battle between the white and black upper right groups is more fair.
But no, black's Q/R12 stones are now weak because they didn't jump out.]
;W[qc]C[A passive answer.  Black can continue pusing at R18 anyway which threatens all kinds of peeps.  White should jump out and try to get ahead in the race with the Q/R12 stones.  Leaning at M/O16 and then capping at O12 sounds good to me.]
;B[rg];W[rf]C[Now you can see that R17 doesn't really give you enough space anyway, so running out is better.]
;B[pg]C[This atari is probably bad; it eliminates the peep/clamp aji and ddoesn't really help black all that much.  It does let him jump out farther into the center, though, so it has some merit.]
;W[qf];B[qk]C[If black is planning to live on the edge anyway, then Q13 is definitely bad for him.

Also now white can live by capturing at S12.  Black did not handle his group well.  And neither player took advantage of the other's mistakes to get ahead in the race toward the center.]
;W[ql];B[rk]C[This is really slow for black.];W[pm]C[Nice move!  Get thickness toward the outside, prepare to bhlock at S7 if black pushes in (of course black will probably jump to S7 himself but this at least doesn't make eyes for him)

Finally, a move with outward strength in mind.
With the weak stones on the left side, and the big gap on the bottom, white should be worrying about outward power a lot.]
;B[pj];W[ok];B[oq]C[This is what I was waiting for.

Wouldn't you rather have the K4 stone a little closer now, so you can attack P3 more severely?

Still, with the white thickness above, P3 looks a little scary for black.

Black is winning this game, so such a deep invasion is not necessary.  M3/4 would be sufficient.  I would probably prefer C8 for black.]
;W[mq];B[qr]C[The low slide is not enough eye space for black.  Attaching at R3 is probably better.]
;W[np]C[enclosing black is probably good, keeping white very strong on the outside.  Still S3 should get life for black, so maybe this lets him off the hook too easily.]
;B[rq];W[rp]C[Isn't black alive anyway?  If so, S4 is way too slow, because black can still jump in to S7.  S4 gets no territory -- it's not worth a move at this stage.  F17, B4 look better to me.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[nr]C[Black adds stones to make sure of life.  The cut at O5 is aji for later, depending on what happens on the left side...]
;W[qb]C[This is a good safe move, but really it is miai with S12 for white to live, so I don't think it's urgent enough to play now.]
;B[rm]C[This is too slow for black; it's only worth a few points.  Even if he cuts off and captures the R4/S4 stones, it's not that big a deal.  Compare it to, say, F16 or C8 ...  I guess black is worried about the life of the right side group.]
;W[qn]C[It is usually better to exchange S8 for T8 first to make sure black doesn't get eyes here.]
;B[rn];W[oj]C[This is a good move; white gets thickness while black is nibbling a couple points on the edge.  Still, if you're thinking of attacking black, make the S8/T8 exchang to eliminate his eyes first.]
;B[oi];W[rl]C[looks like black made a mistake.];B[sl];W[qm]
C[What about white R10?  R7 is certainly unnecessary, isn't it?]
;B[rj];W[mr]C[Another slow-looking move.  White doesn't get territory on the lower side since black can play K2, and black's group in the corner should be able to get life pretty easily.  On the other hand N2 does indirectly defend the cut at O5, which is useful.]
;B[ms];W[ls];B[ns];W[nq];B[pr];W[kr];B[qq]C[Black seems to be trying to make this group live -- was it really in that much danger?]
;W[pp]C[Black should at least have played Q4 himself instead of R3, I think.]
;B[pq]C[Black's shape certainly looks awful now.];W[dc]C[White has gotten strong outward power on the lower right, so needs to use it somehow.  This attachment might get something going but both sides can probably settle locally.  C3 might be an interesting move to try instead, hoping to deprive black of his base in the corner.]
;B[cc];W[ed]C[The cross-cut might be better here, but my reading ability is not good enough to be sure.]
;B[de];W[db]C[The double-hane might be an easier way to settle (C18)]
;B[cb];W[fc];B[hc]C[White looks very cramped here; if this is what he was going to play, then C17 ought to be better.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[ff];B[fg];W[eg];B[df];W[gg];B[fe];W[fh]C[Looks like white got something good here!  His left-side stones are no longer weak with all this outward power.  So if white can live at all on the top, it should be nice for white.  However black will probably get to play B/C4 first because white needs to live on top.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[ec];W[jd]C[White has ended up giving black a big territory.

White could use his outward strength if black has a weak group, but all black's groups are pretty well settled.  I don't see where white is going to get even 40 points to match black's territories, except by making a big territory in the center, which is hard to do.]
;B[mn]C[This is probably a deeper invasion than black needs to make.  Defending at K17 is fine for black, who is ahead in territory.]
;W[no];B[mi]C[This jump is a nice move, eliminating white's chances of a big center territory.  Now white K17 is the only thing left... plus whatever fighting might happen in the lower left.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[kb]C[White needs to try to attack this group, using that fine ponnuki with a move like L15.  Now black can link up with his right side group.  On the other hand he has lost quite a bit of territory at the top.]
;B[lb];W[hb];B[fb];W[ib];B[ke];W[je];B[kf];W[jf];B[jg]C[What is black hoping to accomplish here?  Nothing can happen to white's stones because of the strength of the ponnuki in the center.  Black should play C4 and quietly win the game.]
;W[kg];B[lg];W[kh];B[kn]C[Black is still making things unnecessarily complicated.]
;W[lh];B[mg]C[The upper side has been reduced nicely?

Yes, it has been reduced quite a bit.
But still, where does white have territory?  10 points in thetop right, and a few scattered points here and there is all.

Black has some in the lower right, some on the right side, some in the lower left, plus 25 or so in the upper left, and a few on the upper right.  I just don't see where white can get the territory to win this game without severely attacking the black group in the lower left corner (which is black's only remaining weakness)]
;W[kj];B[dl]C[Black C/B4 would be a better way to just take the corner and calmly win.]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[dm];W[co]C[White C3 is more interesting here because white has to do SOMETHING to catch up on territory.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[in]C[Now all black's groups are safe, and even with the ten points he handed to white on the left side, he got ten points on the bottom left too, so the game is essentially over.]
;W[dj];B[ik];W[fl];B[ii];W[ih];B[hh];W[ig];B[ji];W[jh];B[gi]
;W[fi];B[fj];W[ej];B[fk];W[ek];B[el]C[Now black may even be the one who gets the center territory.]

;W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[pe];W[qe];B[nd];W[mh];B[mf];W[ng];B[lf]
;W[ll]C[ This is too small.

B11 or S12 look pretty big, or P18.  Maybe P18 and a black mistake or two can even let this big group die!  Black should play P18 to ensure life.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[ch]C[This is a bad exchange; can't
black just play B11 right away?];W[bi];B[ir];W[ag];B[af];W[ah]
;B[be];W[hd];B[gc];W[ro];B[sf];W[se];B[nn];W[ob]C[Now it looks like one of black's groups in the upper right might even die!]
;B[nb];W[oa];B[na];W[oc];B[ka];W[jb];B[md];W[br];B[cr];W[aq]
;B[cq];W[jm];B[jn];W[lm];B[ln];W[ni];B[km];W[kl];B[ki];W[li]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[im]C[What about white S11, forcing black S12, then white R11?  Does that have a chance of working?]

;C[Indeed, black made many small mistakes in the endgame (and so did white) but it is very surprsing to me that white managed to get enough points in the center to win this game.  It looked to me that white was hopelessly far behind in the late middle game.

Black: 57 + 9 = 66

White: 51 + 13 + 5.5 = 69.5

White wins by 3.5])
