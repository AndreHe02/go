C[Hello,

My name is Robert, and I'll be reviewing your game.  My review is for Black.


The biggest piece of advice I can give is to not get into so many fights with your opponent.  Instead concentrate on building territory around the edges and corners.  I have a variation here that illustrates my point.]

(;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qj];W[dj];B[jc];W[jp];B[jj]C[Good opening so far.  You might want to wait until later in the game to build the middle.  There's still plenty of space in the corners and sides.]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[nq];B[op];W[np];B[oo];W[on];B[po]C[At this point white has no chance.]
;W[no];B[qp]C[Wasted move];W[pn];B[qo]C[Another wasted move.  The corner is yours, so try extending the sides instead.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[ro];B[so];W[rp];B[rq];W[qr];B[pr];W[or];B[qs]
;W[qq];B[rr];W[ps];B[qr];W[rs];B[os];W[ns];B[nr]TR[ec][nc][qg]
C[Both you and your opponent are spending too much time here.  Think about how many points you could have influence over if you made one of the marked moves instead.]
;W[mr];B[ms];W[mq];B[ls];W[ks];B[lr];W[lq];B[kr];W[jr];B[js]
;W[kq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jq];W[iq];B[rg]TR[pg][qg]C[Placing a stone on the second line is almost always too conservative.]
;W[jr]C[Let him take the stone.  He'll get one point.  Extend your sides, and you'll get much more than one point later.]
;B[is];W[hs];B[jq];W[kp];B[jr]C[Again, let him take the stone if he wants.]
;W[gs];B[hq]C[Three stones in a diagonal is a weak formation.  Good move for recognizing this.]
;W[hp];B[gr]SQ[gq]C[G3 would be the good move for your opponent; therefore, it is the good move for you.  You're trapped with this move (see the variations), but luckily your oponent didn't see it.]
;W[gq]

;B[br];W[bq];B[ar];W[aq];B[cs]C[No need for this.  If your opponent makes a move in here you have plenty of room to make two eyes.]
;W[es];B[sp]C[That got you zero points.  Those stones were trapped.  Again, try building the sides and corners.]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[sm];B[ql];W[sn];B[ro];W[sq];B[mg];W[sr];B[ss]
C[Unnecessary.];W[sq];B[rl];W[sl];B[sk]C[Unnecessary.  White couldn't have escaped.]
;W[bs];B[gg];W[pm];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[di];B[dh]
C[Dangerous move.  When white moves to E12 you're cut off.]

;W[io]SQ[hl][im]C[White has made the mistake of creating a ladder while you're stones are not in atari.  Take advantage of this with a cut across the diagonal.]
;B[gk];W[hl];B[cn];W[co];B[bm];W[bn];B[an];W[cm];B[bo];W[cn]
;B[ao];W[cp];B[am];W[ap];B[bp];W[al];B[bh];W[ak];B[bg]C[White has no chance of saving his stones.  Don't even reply to his moves.]
;W[aj];B[ag];W[ai];B[bi];W[ah];B[bk];W[ji];B[ij]SQ[lj][jl]C[How about a response a bit further out?  It's a bad move by white to touch your stone.  You can gain influence over more territory by extending further.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[hi];B[ik];W[il];B[jl];W[jk];B[kk];W[ii];B[jm]
SQ[im]C[Move at J7 instead to ensure that white cannot escape.]
;W[kj];B[im];W[il];B[jo]C[It's rarely a good idea to touch your opponent's stones with one stone.]

CR[ln][eo][fo][jo][ko][lo][ep][gp][lp][mp]C[Nice try, but white already has two eyes.]
;W[lj];B[mn];W[lk];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll];W[nm];B[lm];W[nn];B[ep]
SQ[cc][fc][hc][lc][nc][ef][jg][oi]C[Look at how much territory is still up for grabs at the top!]
;W[lp];B[gp];W[mp]C[Clearly white needs to learn about the two eyes concept!]

[kl][sl][rm][sm][sn][pp][rp][qq][or][ks][ns][ps]C[You're clearly the better player, so you've won in my opinion.  However, there is much more territory at the top still unplayed.]

(;B[pp];AW[gc][jc][dd][cg][po][op][qp][pq]AE[pp]C[It takes four stones to capture this one point.  Compare that with the number of points that white has influence over in the corner.

Fights are best left for the end.  The beginning is for staking claim to territory.  First the corners, then the sides, then the center.]
