C[Hi, im 18k on kgs, i have been playing go for 8 weeks, in this game i lose by 13 points or so, i play black in this game, if you could tell what moves are wrong and where i should have played, and what areas of my game i should improve that would be gratefully appreciated.
Thank you very much in advance for reveiwing my game];B[pd]

TR[nd]C[Was this the right move?, or shoud have i played somewhere else?

mattn -- This move is perfectly acceptable.  It leans toward white's approach while also building influence at the top.  Notice how the high play at O16 works nicely with the high play at D16, as well.]

;B[sn]C[mattn: It's too early for this sort of move.  White is building a big moyo along the bottom.. now is the time to invade it.  A move around L4 would be proper.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[in]C[mattn: Now the L4 move becomes more difficult, and at what cost?  Black prevented a loss of one or two points on the side, at most.

In Go, you should always want to give away a few points in order to make the big moves.]
;B[sd];W[se];B[sc];W[re];B[pf];W[pg];B[oe];W[qe];B[og];W[rj]

(;B[ph]C[mattn -- This move is not so good.  It does not help black, and only serves to make white's group stronger.]
;W[qg];B[rk];W[sj];B[sk];W[ri];B[sh]C[mattn -- Attacking white's eyespace is the right idea, but as you've seen, this move is too late to be effective.  White did not respond correctly.]

(;W[sg];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[rh];B[sg];W[si];B[sg];W[nn];B[nm]
C[mattn: This sequence is bad for black.  It is only making white's grip on the bottom side firm, and black is not getting much compensation at all.

In retrospect, instead of this move I think you should play G14.  The white stones are not yet alive, so black can chase them toward the thickness at the right, making territorty along the top and building strength through the center.  Perhaps an invasion of the bottom would work then.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk];W[dm];B[dl];W[el];B[dk];W[ek];B[ej]
;W[di];B[kk]C[mattn: In general, you should not change your plans by abandoning the E10 stone that you just played, but this move is big, so maybe it is forgivable..

Again, G14 here would be very big.];W[dj];B[bk];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[gf];B[if]TR[if]C[Was this a bad move?

mattn: I think that H15 might be a bit better, but something needs to be done about white's stones.  Really, black should have been doing everything possible to get to G14 first.]
;W[he]TR[he]C[Where should have i played after this move?]
(;B[ie];W[hc]C[mattn: Ouch!  Your marked group is much to weak to take a beating like this.. J15 was blocking from the wrong direction.]
;B[gb];W[gc];B[fc];W[hb];B[ha]
(;W[ia];B[fa];W[ga];B[fb]C[mattn: Notice that now the moves at G18 and H19 did not serve a purpose (except made white stronger!)  Better to play simply -- G18 should have just been this strong G19 move.]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[cb];B[db];W[ab];B[ca];W[cd];B[ba]C[mattn: I didn't like this move at first, but if you are afraid of the ko, it's probably fine.]
;W[hg];B[hd]C[mattn: Bad idea.  White will respond in the obvious way, but then black will need to defend, and then white has sente.  You should *always* look for ways to steal sente or hang on to it -- it's as important as checking for atari!  :)]
;W[gd];B[id];W[fe];B[ed]C[mattn: Black lives without playing here anyway, because of the B19 move.  Now was the time to take sente away!]

;W[ll];B[kl];W[ln]
(;B[lm]C[mattn: I really liked the sequence up to this point.  White doesn't need to respond right away, so you are just giving up sente when you need it most!  Now white gets to defend and seal off the bottom.  Black should have kept pushing with L6.]

(;B[cq]C[mattn: Way too late for 3-3 invasion.  It doesn't take much to kill a 3-3 stone when you've got a wall in the area, like white C5.

Better to take the large endgame play at A12.];W[dq];B[cp];W[cr]

White would like to play R14 or R11, but either move would be self-atari, and so black has a leisurely kill here.  In fact, black can probably omit S9 and play elsewhere, since the T15 group will die and the S10 group cannot live without it.]
