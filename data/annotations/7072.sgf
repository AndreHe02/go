White played by Michiel Tel (1 kyu DGS)
Black played by James Avis (26 kyu DGS)

Special thanks to Michiel for being willing to play at such a rating difference.  It was a great learning opportunity for me.]
PL[W];W[mq]
(;B[nq]C[First, i'm sorry if my english is not perfect (i'm french). if you wish I can use esperanto :) .

In a game like that, the main goal for white is to start a fight because he knows he has better chances than you to win it. All you have to do is to play strong, to get thickness and secure territory. You mustn't try to keep all the board, just to ensure that you are first in territory.

As first example, I think you didn't have to play the hane. It is a invitation to fight, and with a such rating difference, you know that he has better chances to win it.
Nobi at O4 let him make his territory at the bottom (and he still remains in a disadvantaged position because he can't start a fight). But with this play, you start to secure territory in the area of Q6.]
;W[np]C[Not what black expected.  He thought he'd see a retreat to build a group, but this move seems to be an example of light play with flexibility.  White can sacrifice either stone to build upon the other.

That's true];B[no];W[nr];B[oq]C[Good response, better than taking the stone.]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[lr];B[ko];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[Thats true that it was not the right response. But K2 wasn't the best.]
;W[jr]
(;B[kq]C[Maybe black should have cut at  L2 here?

Look at the variation for L2. It doesn't work. It even gives life to white.

The simplest was the best : block at J2];W[kr]
(;B[is]C[Here black thought he might prevent white from creating a live group in this section.

Black J2 was still the best play. Never play a stone on the first line if it is not a hane or a nobi.]
;W[ir]C[He get into what should be your territory.];B[hr];W[hq]

(;B[gr];W[iq];B[gp];W[gq];B[fq]C[Still trying to contain white's advance.

You had to read as well as you can before playing such a dangerous play. Sacrifice with F4 was still possible.]

I think it is not an urgent move.];W[es];B[mr];W[go];B[hp];W[eo]

;W[cn];B[dn];W[do];B[bm]C[Black has given up the bottom and bottom left, just trying to keep it from spreading up the left side.

Good decision I think.];W[bn];B[cm];W[bp];B[ip]C[Good play, quiet urgent I think.]
;W[od]
(;B[pb];W[ob];B[md];W[mc]C[I don't no really how, but he could have start a more violent fight. Playing like that, I don't know if he hopes that he will destroy your territory after his group is secure (like in the bottom) or if he knows that he will lives small.]

;B[dg]C[At a loss of where to play, now that black has sente, move 70 is an attempt to prevent development in that area.

Thats true that it is the less secured area :)];W[ff]
(;B[ge]C[He still has his four liberties.];W[eg]
(;B[fg];W[eh];B[dh];W[df];B[fi]C[Containment attempt.

Not bad I think.];W[ei];B[ej];W[di]
(;B[de];W[cf];B[ci];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg]SQ[ch]C[This was a very efficient move for white.  It accomplishes the defense of C-12 due to the snapback if captured, and it blocks black's connection up to the upper left corner.

That's true, and that's why B12 wasn't a good move. It wasn't very urgent :). But that is true you havn't any "urgent move" to play at all. Anyway I think C15 gived a few more points.]
;B[ai]C[Retreat.];W[be];B[bd];W[ae];B[ad];W[li]C[Abuse, but normal in handicap game :)]
;B[kh]C[Is this a good response?  Black is attempting to save territory in the top center.

In a normal game, black must be attempting to kill white. Double keima is not bad. But to pressure from bottom was good to, and it secured your territory at the bottom right. (I dont know if it was better)]

;W[mj]
(;B[mh];W[nk];B[ol]C[Blocking access to the lower right corner.

Good idea.];W[lm];B[ln]C[Connecting.

Yes, but connection at N6 was better because it protected the keima with P8.]
;W[km];B[jn];W[kj];B[ki]C[Somewhere around here black read chapter 2 of Han Fui's book L'ame du go (http://senseis.xmp.net/?FourBasicShapes).

I have this book and I am a great fan of Fan Hui (one of the best french players if not the best, and anyway the best  go teacher we have in france). I don't know if you can get the entire book in english but he gives other advices, about when to play atari and when not to do, about how to keep concentration in a important game... Great book !]

Good.];W[jl];B[il];W[sk]
(;B[sm]LB[sl:a][rm:b][sm:152][sn:c]SQ[rk][ql][rl][qm]C[This move took a lot of thought for black.  Playing at A would allow white to play at B and capture the group.
>> No, he has to play T7 to capture :). If he plays S7 you answer T10 and he can't take you before you take him.

Playing at B would put white's small group in atari, and might work, butit would take more plays to settle.

Playing at C would place white's group in atari, but again would take more plays to settle.

Playing at 152 effectively blocks white's intrusion on the side, saves the marked group, and captures the small white group.]
;W[fb]SQ[ff]C[How do you determine if you have enough room to develop in a new area?  Or is white simply trying to connect to the marked stone?


In a normal game I haven't enough room to play in this area. Normally the smaller you can invade is the center of a three point extension (and you can't live there, you have to run away and to make the second eye elsewhere for example). Maybe white know that he has advantage at fight, so he hope to connect or to live. But in the theory, the walls are too strong for an invasion.]

But you could play E14 before and keep the sente, because i threaten his entire group and not only the four stones at E12.]

;W[af]C[White lives.];B[ah];W[bb]C[You haven't to respond.]

(;B[ab]C[Black plays the miai for a rectangular six in the corner, though in this case it is to prevent life for the white group.

I don't know the duration (I see in game info it was on DGS) of the game but it is clear that there is progression from the beginning to the end. All you have to do in a handicap game is like in the end of the game contain the opponent to keep the advantage.
During your progression, when you will improve your reading ability, you will start to be able to read, a few plays before if you can kill a group or not. I recomend you to use Tsumego to improve your reading ability, but not to try to kill everywhere on the board during your games (you didn't do this in this game, but when you will progress it will be like an irrestistible tentation :) ). In no handicap games, you will have to understand that your goal is to give up to the satisfaction of killing big to the satisfaction of letting the opponent live small :).
I recommend you the reading of Attack and Defense, in elementary go series http://www.gobooks.info/g14.html when you will be 15k KGS (sorry I only know KGS and FFG rating)
You won't understand everything but it will be usefull from this level to 5k I think :)
