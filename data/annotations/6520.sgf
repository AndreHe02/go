C[This is a game I lost on DGS.  I play white.  In this game, I build two thick walls on the right side facing center, but I can't seem to do anything useful with them.  I end up resigning, I think I was about 30 points behind.  Where did I lose this game?  I feel like perhaps I should have been more aggressive, but I don't know where.

Thanks in advance for your comments!



+++++ Commentary by Djif-Master +++++

Hi Tom,

I think I know how you feel about your game. You did not really make a huge mistake (locally) but still lost big. That is mainly because your josekis in the corners are not working so well together. Black built a huge moyo, you invaded far to late. In other words, you did not pay attention to the whole board situation and how the groups relate to each other. I'll try to emphasize this point in my commentary.
You can find a summary with my personal suggestion how you can improve your play at the end. I hope you enjoy my review and learn something from it. Since this is my first review for the GTL I'd appreciate your feedback. Now, have fun!

Best regards,
Felix a.k.a. Djif-Master];B[qd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cq]LB[dp:A][pp:2]
[cq:4]C[Djif-Master:
Just a note (not important for the actual course of the game): I looked up on gobase.org for professionals using this opening, because I personally think 4 is kind of strange move. Since 2 is going for influence and quick development and 4 in contrast is territory oriented and rather slow to develope from.
Now, what do professionals say?
Black wins 63 % of the games with this opening.
With 4 at A Black wins only 54 %.];B[dj]LB[od:A][pg:B]C[Djif-Master:
Usually Black is making a shimari in the upper right or left corner, but since White cannot make a good extension from lower left corner D10 looks like a very good move.
A for actual play.
B for different approach of the top right corner creating moyo on the right side.]

(;W[od]C[Djif-Master:
To approach one of Black's corners is good, preventing black from making a shimari.
See variation for different approach.];B[oc];W[pd]TR[qd]C[Djif-Master:
Banging your head against Black's marked stone usually is not good. But in this case there is a joseki.]
;B[pc];W[qe];B[rc];W[nd];B[re];W[qf];B[cn]LB[mc:A][nc:B]C[Djif-Master:
Good! All your moves in the upper right corner were according to joseki, building a thick wall facing the bottom.
Black omits A which is usually played to leave options for further development on the top.
White can punish that by playing at B (you do so later), enclosing Black in the corner.]
;W[ep];B[en];W[jq]LB[jp:A][iq:B]C[Djif-Master:
Your last two moves are following the right idea.
But K3 should be either at A or B.
A is better if you are going for influence and trying to create a moyo. B is better if you want to be prepared fo an invasion around G3. (B also follows the local joseki.)
Still K3 is ok.];B[qq]LB[qp:B][pq:A]C[Djif-Master:
Black's 3-3-invasion is premature. Because it is allowing white to create something big on the right side. Playing R9 would probably the best move for Black.
A for actual play.
B for what makes the difference. With possible continuations of the game and how two make use of the walls.]

(;W[pq]C[Correct direction of play?  Perhaps better at R4?

Djif-Master: Wrong direction. R4 definitly is better.
The reason is, that you allready have a wall in the upper right facing the bottom.]

TR[en]C[At this point I have nice thick walls pointing towards the center; but how should I use them?

Djif-Master:
Walls usually don't just point towards the center they are pointing to one side of the board.
In the upper right the Wall is facing the bottom. In the lower right corner the the wall is facing the left side. There is not su much hope for White to create territory on the right, because there are two holes. The marked Black stone is also a good point from which he can extend increasing is own area while decreasing White's sphere of influence.]
;B[jn]LB[ec:A][ed:E][jl:C][lm:D][hn:B]TR[cn][en]C[Djif-Master:
Black's move is, if threated lightly, a nice reduction move either reducing the bottom or the right side. It also is to see as an extension from the two marked stones creating a very loose wall facing the top.
A for actual play.
B for white's proper answer.
C maybe possible too.
D shows what happens if White is trying to secure the right side.
E shows the difference of high to low approach.]
(;W[ec]LB[hn:A]C[Maybe the high approach is better?

Djif-Master:
Yes, the high approach would be better, but what is more important. You did not answer K6!
Now really is the time to be a little more "aggressive".
I was thinking a lot about White's proper move. I think it should be at A. (See variation.)]
;B[ed]LB[cc:A][dd:B][fd:C]C[Djif-Master:
Neither A or B are correct. White should play at C.]
(;W[cc]LB[fd:A]C[Seems like I should maybe have played D16.  I have one variation in the sgf.

Djif-Master:
White at A is the proper response. See variation.];B[dc];W[db]
;B[dd];W[fc];B[bc];W[cb];B[ge]C[This outcome seems bad for me.

Djif-Master:
You are right, it is not good for you.
You are living very small on the top. Black is building huge moyo with less weaknesses than White's formation on the bottom and right.]
;W[hc]LB[id:B][eg:A]C[Djif-Master:
A for actual game.
B for how Black can get a far better result.]
(;B[eg]LB[id:A]C[Djif-Master:
Black can press down the top at A (see variation), getting an even larger moyo on the left.
White invasion around the E13 area would be just crazy.];W[nc]
CR[ec][fc][gc][hc][id]LB[ie:A][jl:B][hn:C]TR[ge][gf][hg][hh]
[ii][ij][ik][jm][en][fn][gn][in][jn]SQ[jj]C[Too small?  Maybe at K10?

Djif-Master:
Reducing move against Black's moyo is urgent.
There is no special reason for playing at K10.
A, B or C are more reasonable, because there is the proverb: "Play on the border of two moyos". A is the border of White's top and black's left.
B and C are also on the border of Black's moyo. K10 is not at the border.]

White should play at A.];B[ic];W[ib];B[jd];W[kc];B[ji];W[hl]
LB[cj:A][jl:C][hn:B]C[I realized at this point I couldn't let black's moyo be so big, but my invasion/reduction doesn't seem to work too well.  Was it already too late for me?  Is this a good attacking point?

Djif-Master:
Black's moyo allready is huge, invasion is to late.
White can try invasion at A, maybe he is lucky.
B or C would still be the proper points for invading Black's moyo, because this points are on the boarder. If Black answers now at B, what is White going to do? Probably playing C, but then Black is chasing White right into the are where White wanted to make at least some territory.]

;C[Result: B+Resign

Djif-Master:

Your play is very solid. I also cannot complain about your opening if we look at it locally.
But it seems to me, that you do not pay attention to the hole board situation. Like you commented on move 52, that you can't let Black's moyo be so big. At this point the moyo was already finished and then it is very difficult to do anything.
Also the decision which side your wall in the lower right corner should face. I hope that the variations show, why facing the top is better. If you do understand that, then you can improve pretty fast. Try to look for a move or sequence, which is locally the best but also is working well together with the other stones on the board and the stones or groups which are further away. Therefore you have to read out the sequence before you start to play it. Do not only think about your next move, but about your next 5 or 10 moves and how you opponent is going to answer. A good thing to practice that is solving tsumegos. Or you are reading ladders, therefore you put some stones on the board like the next diagram is showing. Then try to read if the ladder works or not. If you read it out, change some stones in the formation on the bottom right and read it again.
Well, that is all I have to say. I hope you enjoyed the review. If you have questions or feedback you can send an e-mail to: djifmaster@gmail.com]
