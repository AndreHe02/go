Dear reviewer,

I played white in this game. I lost but i can't say where my mistakes are. Recently all my games are like this one, i lose without knowing where i did wrong.
Please, can you try to pont out the problem ?

;B[do]LB[pj:A][ck:B]C[Donal: I went over the game, and my feeling is that the main problem is the fuseki. I want to comment on a lot of the moves, including ones where I would play a different move, but yours was not all that bad. There are also fuseki moves where I am sure that there was a better move.

First, when Black comes in at 5, he is playing an aggressive move. He could have played at A instead, allowing White to play at B. This plan of "staying on your own side of the board" takes advantage of Black having the first move, and if both players keep on like this Black will have a bigger framework that White will be forced to invade.

By contrast, black 5 rushes to keep White from making a shimari there, at the expense of leaving A unplayed. This Black strategy is basically more "risky" as he is giving up the natural framework building move and leraving himself open to attack on the left.. As White, I would always play some sort of pincer on the left side, because it keeps Black on the defensive and is a great extension from white 2.]
;W[nc]LB[dl:A][qf:B][kd:C]C[Now, I can also imagine a pro playing at white 6, but this is not because it is bigger than White A, but because it is sente and he is testing Black's response. Before he decides on the perfect move on the left side, he might want to play 6 and then see whether Black answers at for example B or C. He would then probably return to the left side really soon.

If the information gained from playing White 6 would be useful, then it is a sophisticated move, but if it isn't really going to help you to know Black's response, then by all means play at A, which is where the action is at the moment.]
;B[pf]LB[jc:A][qj:B][dl:C]C[When Black answers at 7, as White I don't know how to play. I would like to defend my own stone by playing A, and if Black plays B, I can play at C, which would be great, but if Black plays on the left side, I don't have a good next move. I can of course play B, but it's not as if I can kill Black's stones there.

So it's not clear that the exchange of 6 for 7 helped. Playing at C instead of 6 would have been much simpler.]
;W[pb]LB[dl:A][qc:B][kc:C][cd:D][rf:F][ec:E]TR[ph][qj]C[White 6 was not a big loss, as Black answered it, but white 8 seems strange. First, the move at A is more urgent, but even viewed locally, it doesn't seem quite right.

First, suppose that Black answers at B and White extends at C, which is probably what White expected. If White 2 was at D, this would be a nice position. Black will not want to play kakari at E because of White's strong stones on the right. With white 2 on the star point however, the 3-3 point can be invaded. White doesn't get enough out of the 4 stones he played on the upper side.

Also, in this game, the threat of White playing at B is small, so Black can ignore White 8. Why small? If Black had already enclosed the right side with stones at the marked locations, white B would be large, because White could next play at E and ruin the territory that Black had played all those moves to get. But in the actual game, there is no territory there yet for Black to lose.]
;B[fp]C[By playing 8, White allows Black to get 9 first, which a really nice move. It defends Black from attack and works well with his stoves across the board.]
;W[qc]LB[kc:A][ph:B]C[Finally White 10 is WAY too slow. In this position, White was already safe, as 10 and A were miai. Also, you might have been planning to attack Black next at B, but White has invested so many moves by now that Black can give these two stones up. I think it is safe to say that 10 is the losing move.]
;B[cf]C[Black is pulling ahead with 11, which works well with his stones on the lower left.]
;W[fd]LB[dj:A][be:B]C[White 12 may look reasonable, but it has two problems. One, in combination with White's stones on the right, it is over concentrated. Two, even after playing all these moves, White's upper left corner can be invaded at the 3-3 point. This shape is just no good.

White need to do something else here,  to avoid these problems. One idea is to play at A instead of 12. You eventually had to invade the left side anyway, so it would be easier to do it now. Black might play at 12, but it would work out all right for you.

I personally would play at B. This defends the corner territory and threatens Black's territory. Black might play on the upper side, but note this very important point: moves on the upper side are small, because White is already very strong on the upper right. Both players will try to avoid playing there. White B is the natural way to use the unusual strength of the white stones on the upper right.]
;B[di];W[co]LB[qk:A][ph:B]C[Playing at 14 is the obvious move, but it does seem to play in to Black's hands. I recommend playing at A instead. It's hard for Black to completely kill the stone in the lower left corner with one move. Playing at A is a gentle attack on the two Black stones, and Black doesn't know how to handle that. If you attacked at B, he would just counter pinch and give the two stones up. But there's no good way to do that with such a distant attack.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fr];B[me]LB[qk:A]C[Black 19 looks rather nice, but actually would be better at A. White is so strong on the upper side that Black is not threatening anything. And if White plays at A first, these Black stones could eventually come under attack.]
;W[qn]LB[qk:A][nq:B]C[White 20 is a difficult way to play compared with A. Naturally Black will pinch. Because of the strong White stone at 18, the value of Black B would be small, and the value of a White double kakari at B is also small. Especially when Black has played the extra move at 19, A is the focal point of the left side.]
;B[ql];W[on];B[nq];W[pk]C[This is joseki, but as you know it leaves a cut at the end where Black can attack. It's not such a good idea with Black's center influence.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh];W[ld]LB[bd:A][ll:B]
C[White 32 looks natural, but when you have the extra move at 10 White is so strong already that it is not urgent. Other ideas for moves:

1) A would defend the corner, and aim at various moves on the left.

2) B would defend the weak center group, and begin to erase Black's framework.]
;B[om]LB[le:A][kd:B]C[Black 32 is pretty severe, thanks to Black 19. Having played 32, White would have to answer Black A with White B.]
;W[nm];B[pm];W[nl];B[pn];W[qq]LB[kl:A]C[White 38 is natural, but the weak White stones in the center could be a big problem. Playing at A would be safer.]
;B[qp];W[pr];B[or]
(;W[pq]LB[rp:A]C[Both players are playing pretty well in the corner.  Instead of white 42, A is also possible, but it's much more difficult (see diagram).]
;B[oq];W[rr]
(;B[rp];W[qs];B[ef]LB[lk:A]C[Black 47 is pretty good, but it would be even better to attack White with a move around A.]
;W[id]LB[di:A][dn:B][cn:C][me:D][ld:E][hd:F][ic:G][bl:H][cl:I]
[bd:J]C[I think this move might be a mistake cause it seems to me i did well until then : black A is too far away from B and C, and the exchange black D for white E is good for white due to the presence of white's group on the left side.

Donal: I think the game is already very difficult to win. Note these points:

1) White 48 doesn't really make territory, because Black can attach at F. And even if you played G instead of 48, the 3-3- point is still open to invasion.

2) Even if you invade at H, Black can simply play at I. Even if you connect, you will still lose.

3) With the unsettled White group in the center, Black can get lots of free moves while attacking it, even if he doesn't kill it.

The best move I can think of is J, which defends the corner and threatens the left side a little. Black might play at 48, but this would become a target for attack, and you might come out ahead in the fighting.]
;B[cc]C[After this move it seems i'm behind quite a lot.];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[be]LB[dc:A]C[Normally, you should block at A instead of 52, to defend your own territory. Otherwise, why play 48?]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[eb]
(;W[bg]C[At 56, White might have had a chance to attack. (See diagram.)]
;B[bi];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb]C[White is playing inconsistently here. If the idea of 48 was to take territory, he should not have blocked at 52. And if the idea of 52 was to attack Black on the left, he should not have wasted time with 56, 58, and 60.]
;B[cg]C[With 61, Black has made an almost-alive group of 5 stones, making an invasion more difficult.]
;W[bl];B[bn]LB[gq:A]C[This kind of invasion should be avoided except as a last resort. The White center stones could die, and black 63 is threatening the corner. This became a problem later in the game when Black played at A.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[cj];B[bh]C[My first impression here is that either these white stones or the ones in the center will likely die. Somehow in the actual game that didn't happen.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[fj];B[el]LB[dj:A]C[71 is strange. Black A is the vital point.]
;W[dj];B[ei]C[Black 73 doesn't do much either except to repair the damage from 72.]
;W[gj];B[hk];W[hj];B[ik];W[ij]C[Here i wanted to connect my two groups but it may not be a good idea because black is too strong after that.

Donal: Black has been split into two and is under attack. This shouldn't have happened.]
;B[jk];W[ki]LB[bf:A]C[Instead of white 80, why not attack at A? Even if you can't kill Black, you'll get free moves while attacking.]
;B[le]LB[hc:A]C[Black 81 probably won't help get a good attack in the center, so it should be avoided. White has bad aji on the upper side. How would White answer Black A?]
;W[kd];B[jf];W[lj]LB[bf:A][gq:B]C[Black 83 doesn't do much. White can still profitably attack at A. Black would like to play B, but his upper group might die.]
;B[ih];W[jj];B[gq]LB[bf:A]C[I suppose Black plans to tenuki if White plays A, but he is awfully thin. Black A instead of 81 would have been better.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[kk];B[bq];W[bp];B[cr];W[dr]LB[ar:A][fq:B][ap:C]
C[After white 94, Black can play A, which threatens a connection to the outside and to live in the corner. So instead of 94, White should play B, then C.]
;B[iq]LB[ar:A]C[Since playing at A would be ko, Black 95 is simpler since Black is already winning.]
;W[aq]C[Having to play an extra move in response to 95 is unbearable. The game is over.

As I said at the beginning, the main problem was the fuseki.

To review the main points:

1) White 10 violates the principle of "Playing Away from Strength". It is adding another stone to a group that is already alive.

2) White 12 also violates that principle. White has become so strong on the upper right that a black stone played nearby can be completely ignored. Therefore, neither player wants to play on the upper side at all.

3) White 14 solidifies Black, making an invasion on the left side difficult. Playing on the right side is biggest right now.

3) Black 19 violates the principle of playing away from strength, too. It should be on the right side.

4) White 20 should be a wariuchi. The kakari doesn't work well with Black's strength around the board and White's strong stone at 18.

5) White 32 also plays too close to strength.
