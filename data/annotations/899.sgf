C[Hi, this is jdavis, 22k.
I'll be your reviewer for today ;) Remember that I'm only 22k, so take
everything I say with a grain of salt.];B[oe]C[P15 is a very unusual move.
I think we can safely say that it's probably a poor one, only because some
90% of pro games open with either the 4-4 point (ie Q16) or the 3-4 point
(ie Q17 or R16)];W[pe]C[Q15 is probably also a poor move. In the early
part of the game it makes much more sense to be spacious, and think about
developing your moyo (potential territory) rather than attacking your
opponent.];B[of]C[Same here. Black should move at D16, perhaps, or D3, or
any move like that.];W[ne];B[od]C[Pretend I'm just saying the same thing
over and over again. Move elsewhere! Moves in the other corners are much
"bigger" than these. It's important to think about how big a move is, which
means how many points it's likely to gain or lose. Either black or white
could lose this corner and it's not very important compared to the huge
open spaces in the rest of the board. That said, I'll focus on specific
tactics.];W[nf];B[pf]C[Q14 is, I think, a good move for black. It makes the white
stone at Q15 look pretty lonely and probably gives black that corner. At
this point white should abandon this stone and focus on developing his
other two, which could be a base for taking the rest of the top of the
board. Maybe a move at N17 or K16.];W[pd];B[pc];W[oc]C[P17 is a poor move because a black response at O17 would threaten
it and give black the lead. If it's important to you to save the stones at
Q15-16, a move at R17 would have been better. Also a black move now at R16
creates a ladder which definitely kills those two stones.];B[nd]
;W[pb]C[Q18
is not good; R17 might be better. You're forcing black to make a move
which hurts you.];B[qc];W[qd];B[qf]C[Abandon those stones! They're dead,
dead, dead!
Go play in another corner!];W[rd];B[rf]C[However black needed to move at
R18 or S17 to be safe here, so white suddenly has an
opportunity.];W[rc]C[Good move. Smart to see this.];B[qb]C[Black is
mistaken to try to save these stones. This is a ladder and these stones are
dead.];W[qa];B[rb]C[Good playing, white! You're following that ladder in the
right way.];W[sb];B[me]C[Hard to know what to do now. Probably a stone at
N14 or N13, because that one move will make it much harder to kill the
stones at O15-14. But then quick, go on to somewhere else! All this play so
far has only developed a few points for  each side...];W[ra]
C[Not necessary
to kill at this point.];B[ng];W[mf]C[Nope, nope, nope! It's a ladder, just
like the other one.];B[lf];W[mg];B[mh]C[You could do this all day until you
finally crash into the side.];W[lg];B[kg];W[nc]C[O17 is not the best move. Your stones up in that corner
are alive, unless you make a mistake. So now you need to get some points
elsewhere. O17 only gets you a few extra points, especially because a black
move at N17 cuts you off sharply. N17 is especially strong for black
because it creates the triangle shape of N17-O16-N15 which can not be
quickly killed.];B[lh];W[md];B[ld];W[mc];B[sf];W[lc];B[ke];W[kd]
;B[le];W[kc]C[L16 is too slow, you can move much faster with K16 or
K17.];B[je];W[jd];B[ie];W[id]C[This begins to be bad for you, white. As you
build this wall, remember that you're giving yourself what's on your side
of the wall and giving black what's on his side. What's on his side is MUCH
bigger. Of course you can invade and take some of it away, but still you're
giving him more than you're getting. Remember, your group is alive already
so you don't need to worry about that. You need to see what will give you
large moyo.];B[he];W[ge]C[OK, good to walk away from the wall, but best to
go somewhere far. This move fails as a connecting move, black can and does
cut it easily. So as a single stone, G15 is weak because it's crammed
against a large body of black's stones.];B[hd];W[hc];B[gf]C[Poor move for black, G16 would make more sense. This gives
you the chance toconnect after all, and you take advantage of it. At this
point what black really should be doing is taking advantage of the enormous
power of that wall to start placing stones around J10, Q9, and then further
down. Black could have most of the board at this point, leaving you with
only the top and maybe some of the left side and maybe the bottom right
corner if you wanted it.

The black group, by the way, is also clearly alive; it would be very easy
for black to form two eyes around O15 and N14, or in a couple of other
places. If you don't know what that means, email me. The two-eye concept is
the most important and fundamental strategic concept in this
game.];W[gd];B[hf];W[fe]C[F15 is slow (ie you could move];B[gc]
;W[gb]C[F17 is better -- it also threatens black, pushes him more
against the edge, and also serves to protect the stones at G16-F15 by
creating that same triangle shape.];B[fc];W[fb];B[ff];W[ec]
C[Good move.];B[fd]C[Unthinking move for black. On every move you make it's important
to see whether it gains or loses liberties for your group. A move that
takes you from one liberty to one liberty is pointless 99.9% of the
time.];W[ed];B[ic]C[Foolish move for black (is he flustered now?) to
which you respond correctly.];W[ib];B[hb];W[ha];B[ef];W[ee]
C[Unnecessary
response. I cannot say enough times, go down to the bottom of the board,
it's the most important thing for the last forty moves or so! But if you
must stay up in this corner, C15 is probably your best move, it grabs the
whole corner for you.];B[df];W[cf]C[Probably too weak, as black can again cut and leave this stone
lonely.];B[de];W[dd];B[ce];W[cg];B[be];W[dg];B[ae];W[eg];B[fg]
C[F12 is
better than E12 here, as an attempt to cut by black at E12 can be met with
E11, which becomes a ladder. See variation.]
(;W[eh];B[bf];W[fh]C[One problem is that you're pushing against black's
strength. Since you can't possibly kill black's enormous group here, it's
best to play away from him a little bit so that you've got some breathing
room, ie more liberties.];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg];W[hi]C[Nope, poor move because
black can cut. G11 was correct.];B[gi];W[gj];B[fi];W[ei]C[Now white is maybe in some trouble.  You've only got five
liberties, and black has you somewhat hemmed in.];B[fj];W[fk]
C[Poor move,
E10 is better so that black can't cut. I think it's very important for you
to think about when you make a move, whether black can cut you or
not.];B[ej];W[di]C[D10 is stronger, and safe because black at D11 could be
killed by a response at C11.];B[bg];W[ch];B[dj]C[It's all over for this
group now.];W[ci];B[cj];W[bj];B[bi]C[Black's B11 is hasty; B9 is
better.];W[bh];B[ah];W[ai];B[bk];W[ag]C[The only way for you to live is to
fill in both A10 and A12; otherwise the eye at B11 is a false
eye.];B[af];W[ah]C[Unbelievably you can live here! But if black had played
correctly you would have been most thoroughly dead.];B[ck];W[aj]
C[Congratulations!];B[ak]C[At this point it's best, again, to move to
the bottom of the board, or maybe place one stone at H9 first to help those
stones survive.];W[ek]C[This move is weak because G10 only has two
liberties, so black can (and does) easily cut at H10 or
G9.];B[hj];W[ij];B[gk];W[hk];B[gj];W[ik];B[ii];W[ih]C[K11 is better than J12 because it can be connected to the other
stones, whereas J12, along with H12 and H11, can be easily isolated and
killed. But more important that either would be G8, which would connect the
other two groups, or at least threaten to do
so.];B[ji];W[ki];B[jh];W[jg];B[ig];W[jj];B[gl]C[Foolish of black, he
doesn't see his danger. But he's right to recognize G8 as
important.];W[kh];B[jf];W[jh];B[fl];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[dl]
;W[fm];B[dk];W[en];B[el];W[dn]C[Pretty good sequence.];B[gm]
;W[fn];B[cm];W[gn]C[If it were me I
probably would have played C6 instead, since this group is not yet too
strong and will get stronger moving toward the side than toward the middle.
Also this way you're encouraging black to cut your two groups off, as he
does. Always try to think about what you're encouraging your opponent to
do, and whether it's what you really want him to do. When you can learn to
do this you will rise several stones in strength pretty quickly, in my
experience.];B[hm];W[hl];B[hn];W[ho];B[in]C[Your groups are now thoroughly
divided, so you have to think about how to best expand and protect each one
separately. I would move now at M9, maybe, or at J5 or J4. M9 is probably
the priority, to make sure that that group will live. Right now it's
ambiguous.];W[im]C[You're pushing against black's strength again. Give yourself some
breathing room, your life will be easier :)];B[io];W[go]C[G5 unnecessarily
stong. You're right that H5 could use a stone to protect it, but H4 is
quite adequate for this purpose.];B[cn]C[At this point C5 is probably a
good response, so that black can't push in and eat up your wall. But if
you're going to play on the right side of your group, H3 is
better.];W[hp];B[co]C[Black could have played D5, I think, and threatened
you more. You should respond now with D4, I think.];W[fp];B[jm]
;W[il];B[jn];W[jl];B[do];W[fo]C[Very poor move. You destroy your own potential eye. Why
not E5?];B[eo];W[gq];B[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[is]
C[It's difficult to assess who is more helped by this wall. You
save your group, it's true, but at the cost of giving black a lot of
territory on the other side of the wall. Probably it's better for
black.];W[fr];B[ep];W[fs];B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[es];B[dr];W[ds]
;B[cr];W[cs]C[This sequence is pretty silly; either of you would be
better off playing elsewhere. There are really two important questions left
on the board. 1) Does the white group defined by the eye at J11-K11 live?
and 2) How much territory can white grab in the bottom right hand corner?

The answer to 1) may very well depend on who plays first in that area,
although the advantage is definitely with white. The answer to 2)
definitely depends on who plays first.  A stone at Q4 is pretty big for
either player.];B[br];W[bs];B[ar];W[as];B[gs]C[Totally silly move for
black. The white group is alive, and there's nothing anybody can do about
it.];W[gr]C[Pointless response for white. As long as you have two distinct
eyes, it makes no difference how big or small they are.];B[km]
;W[kk]C[Good move, now white lives, because you can connect at either L10
or L8. However another move might have been a bit better, maybe M9, because
it gives you a better chance of breaking out of black's pincers. That is,
as it is you live but you'll probably be enclosed pretty
small.];B[lm];W[kl]C[Unnecessary move. At this point a play around N10 or
N9 is best...or Q4.];B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[nl]C[This is a mistake you've made
a number of times. This stone can be easily cut by black. Try to watch out
for this particular configuration.];B[mk];W[nk];B[mj];W[nj]
;B[mi]C[At this point O6 is probably biggest for you. Or maybe
Q11.];W[ni];B[li];W[lj];B[nh];W[nm];B[mm];W[mn];B[nn];W[no]
;B[on];W[oo];B[om];W[ol];B[pm];W[pn];B[pl]C[Unfortunately for you
this is not a true ladder even though it kind of looks like one. And using
ladder techniques in a false ladder often leads to
disaster...];W[pk]C[White is in some trouble here. You've allowed yourself
to be cut into two groups, and it seems to me very difficult to make them
both live. I would focus on the lower group, with a move perhaps at
R6.];B[po];W[qn];B[qm]C[Here you're blessed with the opportunity to prevent the cut
with a move at Q4...although it may be possible to kill black. Black should
have moved at N5 in order to be sure to live.];W[ql];B[rm]C[Now there's
trouble. Black has three liberties, while your stones at R6 have only two,
your stone at R8 has only two, and of course your stone at N5 has only two.
Both black and white are precariously balanced
here.];W[rn];B[mo];W[ln]C[This should get you nowhere, as black can move at
M5, but black doesn't see that.];B[np];W[op]C[A move by you at N4 would be
double atari.];B[qo];W[sm]C[Now it would be a true ladder if it weren't for the fact that
black's next move threatens R8.];B[rl];W[qk];B[oq];W[pp]C[This IS a true
ladder.];B[sl]C[..but black doesn't take advantage of it. Nevertheless
black's move is good and will kill the white
group.];W[sn];B[ro];W[rk]C[Excellent move! You've accepted the mistake you
made and are trying to save what can be saved rather than fighting a lost
cause.];B[so];W[sk];B[oj]C[This looks like a good move for black, although P11 is
probably better.];W[oi];B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[rj];B[qi];W[qh]
;B[ri];W[sh]C[Weak move. You need to press your advantage bye moving at
S12.];B[sj]C[But black's response is poor as
well.];W[si];B[ok];W[rh];B[qp]C[Unfortunately this move pretty much gives
black the rest of the board.];W[lo];B[pq];W[lp]C[Unless black plays badly
there's just not room for you to form a live group.];B[mp];W[lq]
;B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[ls];B[ms]C[You see, you've got this wall, but
just a couple of well-placed stones by black will eliminate the possibility
of forming two eyes.];W[kr];B[kn];W[js];B[jr];W[ks];B[kq]C[We are now pretty much in end-game. It's pretty clear what
lives and what dies, and all that remains is to clarify details. The
biggest moves for white are in the upper left hand corner.]
;W[hg]C[This
move is very small.];B[if];W[oh];B[cd]C[Good move for black. C17 would
maybe be better.];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[ac];W[ab]C[This move is just a little too strong. Black can kill if he plays
properly, although he doesn't.];B[cb];W[dc]C[At this point black plays B19
to kill.];B[ca];W[db];B[ba];W[da];B[aa]C[Oh, black does kill, he just does
it in  a more roundabout way.];W[pg];B[og];W[qg]C[Nicely played sequence.]

----------

You don't seem to have recognized that the white group at and around M4 is
dead. So is the black stone at J17. So this game wasn't really scored
properly.

Conclusions -- Don't be scared off by all my negative comments. You're
making mistakes that every beginner makes. The main, crucial thing is to
learn not to be so focused on the battle at the expense of the war. Develop
your moyo early in the game; I can't tell you how important this is. Don't
be afraid to lose a few stones if it means picking up a lot of territory
elsewhere. Don't attack your opponent's strength, attack his weakness and
walk away from his strength. Watch out for that cutting move. Always be
conscious of whether you can make a group live by giving it two eyes.
Always be conscious of how many liberties each of your groups has. Think
carefully about what you're encouraging your opponent to do.

Play a lot :)

Don't hesitate to email me (j_d01@gnofn.org) with questions or get my
attention on IGS. I'm jdavis and I'm around most weekdays. I'm happy to
play 9x9 or 13x13 most of the time and occasionally 19x19.

Best of luck.])
