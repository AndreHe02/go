AB[pd][dp]C[Nictus [19k\] vs. Lothe [21k\]
Preliminary comments by Lothe (Black).

First Impressions:

Recently I've been doing a lot of actual "Go study" (in particular, I've been going over more advanced games and reading HARUYAMA Isamu and Nagahara Yoshiaki's book "Basic Techniques of Go").

So I find myself at a point where I am aware of some of the more complex tactics and plays involved in a game, and am even starting to develop a sense as to when and where they should be played, but for the most part my ability to actually play them is limited to a little bit of uncertain intuition--if asked why I made a certain extension or play here or there, I'd likely say, "Well, it was either point A or point B..."

This game left me with a rather unfamiliar, somewhat frustrating sensation of knowing that the right choice is between two or three alternatives, but then either making the wrong choice or following it up incorrectly.  Though if one is supposed to lose 50 games before they can expect to start winning, I suspect at least a hundred more are required to begin developing deeper skill.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ed]C[White begins the fighting with an ikken tobi attack.  I felt like I remembered a joseki which begins this way, though my memory for such patterns is poor at best and my responses were based on intuition and the little knowledge at my command.]
;B[gd]C[Intended to press the White stone.];W[df];B[de]C[Trying to split the White stones.

i think that as a 21k you are trying to be too agressive.  you leave too many open spaces, when you try to fight.  you have to know how to fix them later.]
;W[ee];B[dd]C[that shape is very weak];W[eg]
(;B[ff];W[ef];B[fe];W[dc]C[you see now he cut you in half.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[ca];B[ba];W[db];B[bc];W[be]
C[Here my group dies.  This battle has rather a large effect on the game as a whole, since one of White's major territorial areas at the end of the game is this left side.
  
next, you should have taken bigger moves like
4-k or 10-q or extend here]
(;B[qq]C[An invasion into White's corner at 3-3.
now it is mostly a early error.  that  at most is a 25 point move. look for something bigger than 25 points]
;W[jp]C[i dont know why white did this]
(;B[gq];W[dn]C[Another vaugely-familiar joseki beginning.  Here I try to get a bit of territory and fend off White's potential invasion into my space.
if it

i dont rember anything like this so i couldent help];B[fo];W[cp]
C[The play F5 was intended to attack D6 and extend outward influence, but White takes the opportunity to push down into my territory.

insted of just attacking you can attack and build terratory by moving at c5 not f5]
;B[dq]C[I try to cut off White's advance and consolidate what territory I can.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[cs];W[bs];B[dr];W[bq];B[co]C[This play kept me thinking for a while before I made it; the major threat in my view was a White extension at D5, but I felt I could extend back to C6 myself and that the F5 stone would provide the requisite influence and power to win the fight.  (Variation.)]

(;W[bo];B[do]C[Rather, White halts my inward advance and I pull back to connect my groups.]
;W[cn];B[en];W[em]C[At this point it seems to me that my only real hope of winning is to keep White from surrounding as much territory as I can.  (Inelegant?  Yes.  But... )  It seems here that White has mostly conquered the left side, and so I begin to make for the center.

what he is doing is playing for the center he is making you run, and at the same time he is building influance twards the center.  you are just getting blocked off.]
;B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[hq];B[gp]C[I start to see eyes forming and work to keep them there...]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[gm];W[pq]C[White finally replies to the san-san invasion and so I shift my focus for a moment.

he only started now because he only thought it was inportant to do so now]
;B[qp];W[qo]
(;B[pr]C[Trying to avoid being reduced to a Bulky Five, which always seems to happen to me when I reply to a situation like this with a move like S5.

this was a mistake you should have moved at s4 watch];W[or]
;B[ps];W[os];B[rr];W[nq];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm]C[Here I see him simply running me along the side and containing me whilst he takes the huge central area for himself.]
;W[ql];B[qg]C[...So I advance outward while I have the chance.

you are still leaving your self open to an attack at m16 by doing this i think insted of that you should have moved at L17]
;W[ph];B[pg]C[Walling off what territory I can get my hands on. 

you are only giving him more terratory by running like this]
;W[rl]
(;B[sp]C[This secures two eyes; even if White plays T7 later I can simply reply with T6.  (Admittedly, this leaves a threat open for White to exploit later, but under the circumstances I felt it was more important to have a chance to play elsewhere than spend a move defending T7.)

this was totaly useless. watch];W[ld];B[nd]C[I thought hard about this move.  In the end I decided to rebuff White near my own territory, but I was sorely tempted to play J16 or K16.

first of all you shouldent have been in this spot.  if you had closed it off earlyer this would have not been a problem]
;W[id]C[Turns out White plays J16 for me, and I berate myself for not seeing how essential this was to making eyes.  However, I do attempt to save the group anyway...]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[kc];W[kd];B[jc];W[mc];B[nc];W[mb];B[nb];W[fb]
;B[gb]C[see he cut you in half again.  you would have had alot more it you had closed it off earlyer]
;W[fa];B[ga];W[hc]C[This was the vital point, I thought.];B[hd]
C[Here I thought I could still rescue the group.  In fact, if I had thought about it harder, it might have been possible.  But I abandoned the fight too early and by the time I realized there might have been potential to save the group, it was gone.]
;W[kb]
(;B[na]C[nooooo...... watch];W[jb]
(;B[me]C[Here I shift my focus back to moving into the center and consuming territory.
no you want your group alive!!!!!!! its to late to save never mind]
;W[ib];B[kf];W[jf];B[lf];W[jg];B[hb]C[Somehow I missed the fact that the three stones J, K, and L 17 were in atari.  I thought I could still manage two eyes by capturing H17 and then playing H14.  (Or the potential to get two eyes, anyway...)]
;W[lc];B[md];W[fg];B[ek];W[cl];B[ej];W[di];B[fi];W[fh];B[ei]
;W[dh];B[dj];W[cj]C[Trying to eat away a bit of White's left-side territory, to little avail.]
;B[gk];W[gi];B[hj];W[jj]C[White sets up to sacrifice some territory but gain more--really a very good move.

yah he is attacking and building terratory at the same time this is what some one wants to do.]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[gj];W[gh];B[ii];W[ji];B[ih]C[Here threatening two different directions.]
;W[ig]C[White probably makes the right choice to block here.]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[nh];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[oj]
C[This was actually a very interesting move.  I had my eye on capturing the stone at Q12, though P10 makes it a lot harder.]
;B[jl]C[Here I pushed into White's territory.  I also strongly considered J8 instead, but felt that this would be too conservative.  My main concern was that White would play J8 next and isolate the K8 stone.  But after some thought I figured that this game had turned into more of a learning experience and less of a potential win, so I tried it anyway.

its also good to know when you are close to winning and far from it]
;W[kl]C[This was not the reaction I had expected, but it did allow me to pull back less chaotically than I had imagined.

because your move is too slow he dident want to answer it because there was more pressing matters like fixing his wall there at k4]
;B[im];W[kn];B[jm];W[km];B[lh]C[White's starting to consolidate center territory and I move to steal as much of it as I can.]
;W[li];B[lg];W[mi]C[why dont you just atari him at r3]
(;B[rg]C[Planning a cut at Q11 to run the Q12 along the Black wall.]
;W[qh]C[White of course anticipates my plan and thwarts it.

some people(me too) always underentimate your opponent.  dont do this.  if you see something than he already thought of it too. and knows how to fix it.  he is not stupid.]
;B[qj]C[Mostly as an experiment, I play the "net point" on White's formation, hoping I might be able to sneak my wall around (with S12, say) and connect to it.]
;W[rh];B[sg];W[rj];B[sh]
(;W[ri]C[White annihilates any hope of that sort of plan.  Ho ho.]
;B[sm]C[I take a moment to close off this space.];W[sl];B[si]
;W[sj];B[jk];W[kk];B[ik]C[Now I feel much safer here, though this play perhaps wasn't entirely necessary.

if anything j10 was better it saves you a point.];W[ki];B[ma]
;W[la];B[ke];W[je];B[le]C[Connecting the two groups here instead of waiting for White to force me to do it (at N14 or O14, in my own territory no less) with a play here.
there alreeady connected  at n14 he cant play there you know]
;W[gr]C[I wondered when we'd get to this invasion.  It was probably bad form to let White decide when to start it, but at least I felt relatively comfortable responding to it.

insted of playing that m15 you play h2 you save terratory.  that was bad form.]
;B[fr];W[gs];B[fs];W[hr]
(;B[eq]C[The last few plays seal off cutting points and so on.

you dident need this move];W[dk];B[qc]C[My last real concern after the little center area was that White might attempt to invade this corner, so I blocked off the prime invasion point.]
