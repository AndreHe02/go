C[tasita:
this variation is common in use. not bad.];W[pf];B[qg]C[tasita:
the Q14 and R13 exchange is not suitable time. It is too early. white may keep it and move it at suitable time, for this exchange sells the possiblity of R12.
>>From the comments of the 28th move. you will know why i say so. I will do first stage decision at 28th move.

I know maybe white is worried that black will move Q14, dont worry. have a look at Variation 2.]

(;W[fc]N[continue...];B[df];W[fe]C[tasita:
I can understand why white moved F15. Since white has moved Q14, white wants to move F15 to get huge moyo. however, before that white might move D18. The corner is big. if black H17, white just F15, it is a fight that is good for white.]
;B[nb]C[tasita:
for white 22th move, I recommend another variation.
white might consider O19 to fight since white already moved Q16. Q16 gives black territory(space), so white should get return at some place, such as fighting, attacking etc.]
;W[nd];B[oa];W[mc]C[tasita:
have a look this local variation. Black gets much space while white has less.]
;B[db]C[tasita:
it is very big. it is why i said that white should move D18 before F15.]
;W[eb];B[dc];W[ie]C[tasita:
J15...en, since black is leading now(look at the follwoing analysis), white should consider move F13 instead of J15, and try to make big moyo. J15(28th) just keep 22pts space for white. not enough.

white: 22+pts(top)
       a star(right-bottom)
total:22+pt and a star+5.5pts

black: 12+pts(top-right)
       13+pts(top-left)
       a star (left-bottom)
total: 35+pts and a star

because black R13(17th move) and D14, we can find that black's star(D4) is better than white's star(q4) and black is more expandable.
otherwise, black holds sente now. the next move will be O3.
according to the above analysis, I think, black is leading now. of course, for amateur player, it is a little better. However, it is sure that Q14 is not time. Q14-R13 exchange is not suitable time. if white didn't move Q14, white keeps the choices of Q14 or R12.This is the better way. Keeping possibility is important.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[jp];W[pr]C[tasita:
Q2 is some slow. better C6. anyway, C6 got much space. Now white has equal space with black. But in whole game, black has fast speed, still black leading. so Q2 is not good. C6 is important. Next, black will move D9 to build big moyo. If so, black did good openning game.]
;B[oq]C[tasita:
not good. now D9 is the biggest.of course, after Q2, white has M3. black just move M5 to keep doing big moyo, thatt's ok. dont fear M3.]
;W[pq];B[no]C[tasita:

look at this local variation. It is clear that P3 is worse than P2. In general, P3 should be in the place of P2 because P3 gives white N1 jose, not good ah.sigh.]
;W[qi]C[tasita:
R11 is not good.right-up corner black is thick.R11 is hitting on black thick group.not good. Even, here black may pass it and move D9. next, white Q13 or Q12. white still has weak point. B can cut white and fight here when B has stones outside, e.g. when B has stones at K10 around.]
;B[pg];W[og]
(;B[dk];W[ph]LB[oh:a]C[tasita:
P12 better than Q40.the center is important.];B[jj]C[tasita:
black is leading in open game. now white is about one stone behind. It is almost same to black H2 game.]

black win 3.5pts
At the beginning black is leading a lot. but b's fighting is worse than white sometimes. What a lucky it is black win at last. Actually black have should won more. It is a resign game, not jose win.

>>From this game, black should improve close-fight skill. White should improve whole game view, finding the urgent and biggest move.]
