RE[W+Resign]

C[I'm not quite sure how I lost this game.  Everything seemed to be going great in the beginning then it all fell apart.  Maybe I got a little over confident, or perhaps I was thrown off by how fast my opponent was playing.  Anyhow If you see the turning point, or perhaps I was always losing, please point that out.

On a side note, I often miss alot of key moves so If you see any, and im sure you will ^_~, please point them out as well; it would help alot.

Thank you for your time in reviewing my game...

*I played as Black

C[Your opponent plays chinese fuseki.
There are several ways to respond.
A blocks the corner enclosure but the stone will be pinced by the stones 1 & 2.
So B seems a better option.
C & D are defensive moves.
There are many other options but this 4 are simple.];B[di]C[So this move seems bad.]

Thank you...

The lost fighting at the left bottom cost a lot and you must learn the big move on the yose but I don't see BIG mistake.

I f you have any question e-mail or open a chat on KGS I'm Evidence.

Good luck for your next games :)])
