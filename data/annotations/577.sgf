C[This move is inconsistent with the stones in the other three corners, especially B1.
These are all high and so the center is important.  I would play this at D5
]
;W[iq];B[kq]
C[Too early to try something like this.  With the high komi there
is no need to be so precipitous.  White's extension is very wide and so is not
so strong.  White's only follow up move here is F3 which still leaves a big gap
behind it. I would play at R16 and let W decide how to deal with two shimari.
]
;W[fq];B[nq]LB[ko:a]
C[Rather that get the cramped shape which results from playing at O3, black could try a move at A.
However, this way of playing may be too vague for a game with a 20 komi.
]
;W[oq];B[np];W[pn]
C[Black now has a two stone wall with a two point extension, instead of the desired three-point
extension.. White on the other hand has an ideal extension on the left.  This
would be much better for black if 5 were at D5, but then white would not have played this way.
]
;B[jo]
C[This is an overplay. Again, it would be reasonable if
B5 were on the fourth line, but there is little expectation of catching W and
this knights move just leaves weaknesses in the shape for W 
to exploit..  Playing at L5 is stronger and is difficult for W to ignore.
]
;W[io];B[in];W[jn]
C[This move looks like an overplay but it is hard to see how to
take advntage of it.  Given the komi it is probably inevitable.

and conect anyway.  Extending looks better.  See sample variation.

(;B[er]LB[gq:a]
C[At all costs, black must not let white use these stone as
kikashi to give himself the chance to separateblack, as happens in the game. 
Trying something like A (see variation) looks interesting, although it could get complicated.

It would have been better to connect at 29 with B21
]

C[If W lives this is not a big move.  It may be better to block White in and extend on the left side..
See variation.

;W[en]C[White is out and black is now on the defensive
];B[gl];W[cn];
B[do];W[eo]LB[lm:a][jk:b][gj:c]
C[Black's corner is alive.  Following white around is submissive.  The terrritoy black
gets in the following sequence is questionable because of the weakness of the
center group.  Black needs to find a way to play against the three white stones
in the center before white can use them offensively.  Ba, Wb, Bc is a possibility.
]
;B[dn];W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[el]LB[hl:a]
C[I would prefer to see this move be used to protect the
center stones.  Although the following sequence gives B a sizable territoy on
the left, W safes all his stones in addition to territory and influence,  
A move at 'a' several threatens for 3 center stones.
]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[fm];B[dk]
C[Black doesn't have time for this.
If W captures the 4 black stones the game is too easy for him.  Black must make a
bamboo joint in sente and fight it out withthe 3 center stones.
]
;W[gm];B[lm]
C[Too late.  This had to be done while the three white stones
could be threatened.  If B is concerned about eye it is better to seek then on the side first.
]
;W[gk];B[cf]
C[I would play this at F17.  The potential for territoty at the top is greater than on the left.  Blacks strength on the left
makes this side unappealing for W to play so B does not need to.
]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[be]
C[This move is rarely seen unless W is trying to avoid overconcentration at the top.
At this point it would be good for B to count the game.  If he blocks at B14 he can expect about  40 points on the left.  W has about 20 at the bottom which is the size of the komi.  B can probably afford to make the left side secure because W cannot protect the top left
corner with a single sente move.  Playing 49 and  not following up seems contradictory.
]
;B[fc]
C[This seems inconsistent.  Black has gone to a lot of trouble to build up a left side territory and now he is abandoning it.
]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec]C[E18 looks more interesting];W[dc];B[ic]
C[Too narrow. K17 balances better across the top.
];W[bf];B[qd]
C[I would try R8 to see what response it gets before W extends down the
side.  If W invades the corner B will make territoy at the top.
]
;W[qi];B[pj]C[Try R5 first to see what W does.
];W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];
B[mk]LB[ge:a]
C[Black seems to be loosing a sense of direction.  This move does not contribute to any territorial framework and is
not necessary to help the lower group.  Saving B63 and 65, which are kikashi stones, is not essential. at this stage.
]
;W[pi];B[mi];W[kk];B[nl]
C[Black has been intimidated by W.  This stone is not necessary for the safety of the lower
group.  If black is concerned about the lower group  a move at O2 looks better.
]
;W[pl]
C[this seems small.  An invasion at the top seems right at this stage.
]
;B[ld]C[This should complete a large territory at the top.
];W[jc];
B[id];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[kd]LB[nd:a][lc:b]
C[Black A looks better. 
If W extends, B plays B.  If W counter-ataris at 79 then B extends.  This way W's shape is not as good.
]
;W[ne];B[mc];W[mf];B[nd];W[rd];B[rc];W[qe];B[pd];W[nj];B[oo]
C[Black may not have much of a chance on the lower right side but this move vastly reduces any potential there may be without gaining much for B.
]
;W[po];B[mj];W[ci]
C[This move makes the swing on the left side about 30 points from what it would have been had B
played a t 60 earlier.  THe trouble is that after W60 black did not have a good move here.

LB[ei:a][re:b][jg:c][pg:d]
C[This seems unnecessary.  The game is close  but black is still  ahead it he can get
enough of the remaining big points.  B 'a' would threaten 103 while taking away
most of the territoy W is threatening in that area..  'b' is probably sente if
played at the right time, as is O2.  Black can also aim at the ponnuki at N14. 
There is no way to kill this but an attack may gain profit elsewhere. this
attack would start with a move at 'c',followed by 'd'

C[Black's main problem in this game was a lack of a consistent plan in the middle game.
Moves such as 63 and 65 gave W territory but these stone contributed nothing to b's final score.  Black had potential for expanding his top side into the middle but failed to pressure white when the opportunity was there.  
The root of these problems was a failure to attack the W18 group before W attacked the B19 group.  This one chance affected the whole of the center game.
