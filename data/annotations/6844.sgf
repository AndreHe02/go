C[Thanks for reviewing the game for me. I played black.  Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I want to improve my weakness. I would appreciate any advice about my game.

  Hi,
My name is Guillaume and I reviewd this game for you. It was a nice game to review. I would also like you to know that my ideas are from my point of view and are not nesecerly right. So please dont take anything I say for word but think about it, and if you dont agree then you probably have a good reason. 
  If there are any questions considering the comments please let me know ^^
  
PS: ( The main comments are at the end of the game ^^, enjoy )]

(;B[jp]C[It is not my style to play this opening. I think you have to find a balance between high and low stones. Now all your stones are high ( on the fourth line ) this leaves a weaker place under your stones. I would recomend K3, or p16 or P17 to not give white a corner enclosure.

I put some sequences on the moves before ^^];W[kc]
(;B[dj]C[a high stone again ^^, But its a hard choice now on how to invade/reduce whites top group. maybe F 17 instead...]
;W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[Now white has invade your teritory. This is your chance to attack. You can use the P3 move to reduce his base and then extend, just remeber that the p3 move should only be used when you have a stone ( like K4 here ) reducing whites extention space. This is because after the sequence white still hace a nice R3 invasion.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[no]
(;B[fc]C[hmm... I think that you have to be carefull here. When you have two long extensions from a D4 stone the C3 invasion looks big, white will probably try it. So if you attack black with the F17 stone and he plays along kindly, I think you end up having no great choice after the C3 invasion. But if you play C14 and all goes smoothly then you can make a bigger moyo, and your stones will be working better together.]

(;B[nb]C[white can not connect at the top, I think the right direction here is a jump to the center, aiming at the weaknesses on the right side.]
;W[ob];B[qf]LB[pe:A]C[you have to be carefull, this is a weak shape. but you can use it to mislead your opponent in certain situations often requiring a sacrifise.]
;W[pe]C[now I think it is very hard to save the two groups. It is a litle bit too much to ask. So now the question is which thickness do you want. Do you want to face the R10 stone or the L 17 group.]

(;B[pf];W[oe];B[of];W[ne]
(;B[ka]C[hmm... Maybe you could have tryed to sacrifice the stones at the top and  get thickness faciong the right side. Sacrificing  for compensation.]

C[very good];W[re]MA[pr][ch]C[this is you chance to take sente. The X (Q2, C12 ) moves still look good, and should be played I think]

Comparing two options during a game is always good. It helps you see eveything in a bigger way, and trains your reading ^^]

[ce][be]C[Thank you very much for sending your game, it was interesting to comment.
  In big I would say you should work a bit on the next points:

1/ Not all stones are worth saving.

  This is a very important part of the game. You should always try and consider the value of stones. Sometimes you can save a few stones and get two points ( the two eyes), but the points that your opponent gets out of the chase can be huge.  When stones are not worth saving, you can still use them indirectly, to build thickness for example.

2/ When attacking a group the chase is often more important than the kill.

  Think about it next time ^^ The Chase. If you can attack a group and get a lot of points in the chace, then the attack is a succes even if white survives. While if you attack a group and can't win anything with the chace, then attacking was probably a bad idea in the first place.


I'm sure that if you practice these points in your game you will quickly get better.

I hop you enjoyed the commented game ^^

bye, 
and lots of fun for the rest.])
