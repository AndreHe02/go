AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[ChiyoDad: Xiexie ni.
wenzi: i'll add handicap?
wenzi: since i lost to u in the morning..
ChiyoDad: Adjourn this game then and I'll send you a new one.
ChiyoDad: How many stones?
ChiyoDad: Oh. Okay, you set it up.

RW> Hi my name is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS. I will review the game for black. My comments i will precede with RW.]
;W[df]C[Is there a standard response to his one point attack?]

(;B[de]C[RW> as a rule of thumb, you should avoid touching the opponent stone. see var]
;W[ef];B[ee];W[gf];B[ge];W[jd];B[ie];W[id]C[ChiyoDad: Which client are you using?]

;B[ld];W[gc];B[gd];W[le];B[ke];W[lc];B[md];W[nd]C[Would not have been able to contain white if he linked at L17.]
;B[kc];W[fc];B[ec];W[hf];B[he];W[eb];B[db];W[fa]C[White moved at F1 to prevent an atari later (if black places at F18)

RW> White is creating compensation for the loss of the K16 group. The F19 move is creating the shape to build two eyes at F18 and G19 (or even H19)]

(;B[da]C[RW> The essential to this white shape, the heart of the white shape, is G18, because it touches both eyes F18 and G19. If black can move there before white can, then black is dead. See var.]
;W[ea];B[cf];W[ib];B[jc];W[gb]C[wenzi: hmm.. where are u from?]
;B[ia];W[ha]C[wenzi: hmm.. where are you from?];B[ja]C[ChiyoDad: California, see http://chiyodad.blogspot.com]
;W[cg]C[RW> black now has a base (touchdown on first line, with lots of expansion possibilities to the center. White however has no base yet. So that is why he will go to the left side of the board.

If you look it this way, you see that white is on the run, looking for safety.]
;B[bf];W[dh];B[bg];W[bh];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag];W[bi];B[ce]C[RW> safe play - C15 is vital. Well done.]
;W[do]C[RW> at first i thought this was a rude move by white. but really , white is not that much stronger player. Surely he meant not to insult. 

The way i see it, white was just glad he touched base (at A11) and now wants to create territory between the lines 5 and 13.

If white wants territory and strong base then he needs to play C6 and not D5.]
;B[eo]C[Problem of not knowing where to tsuke again.

RW> it is like in the beginning. With each one stone there is no need to touch.]

(;W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm];W[cn]
(;B[co]C[RW> have a look at the ladder in the variation. It starts with B6 instead of C5. This ladder will save your C7 group instantly.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[cp];B[cq]C[Gave up on D5 since it was dead. Went on to surround the bigger white..]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[cl];B[el];W[fm];B[bl];W[bk];B[ak]C[Was there any way the 4 stones could have escaped?

RW> yes by playing the ladder B6 instead of C5];W[am];B[ao]

(;B[ng]C[Lost quite a lot of territory on the left centre..

RW> yes, go is often a choice between two extremes. one is where no one gets any points, and the other is where both get a lot of points. but it does not matter for the score.

For further breakdown of white left area, see var];W[qk]
(;B[oh]C[RW> here black is choosing that both shall have no points. Q16 is all alone and needs protection. See var]

;W[qj];B[ri];W[qi]C[White managed to creep into the territory using ataris..

RW> yes and in fact you can see white has one big group on the right side of the board. The way to go here is to acknowledge the fact that you cannot kill white R11 group. So black needs to retreat 2 or 3 lines from white. R14 or S15 would be good]

Could more have been played at the left centre portion?

RW> yes, with black H13. But only earlier in the game, as shown in one of the variations

How do I better defend my territory?

RW> since you won, you can not do better. Thank you for inviting me to your game. Best regards, Ron]
