AB[pd][dp][dd]C[I'm playing black in this game against a member of my local go club. We play ocasionally and usually keep it at 3 stones. I am about 11k AGA (13k online).

I feel I made some strategic mistakes early by trying to be greedy and save all of my stones and territory. I lost a large group this way. I would especially like commentary about my mistakes that led to this loss and where I went wrong. I suspect is was earlier than I think.

I would also like your comments about other aspects of the game in general, good and bad for both players, as I will likely share this review with my opponent.

Thanks,

Tom Obenchain
(RazorBrain)];W[oq];B[jd];W[qp];B[pj];W[cn];B[cl]C[Black plays well so far. The pincer helps creating a large black moyo at the top.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ce]C[Black could play a pincer and extension at C12 instead (see variation).]
;W[ci];B[dn]C[Black could play the forcing move at D14 first.]

C[I think ignoring the cut at A ws a mistake.

R: yes, Black must connect (see variation).]
(;B[jq];W[dl];B[el];W[ck]C[Now W is solid and W has weaknesses.]
;B[df];W[ek];B[fm]C[Black should connect solidly at E7 instead.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[gm]C[Black does not have a nice shape and is running out of liberties.]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[hk];W[gk];B[hl]C[This result is not good for B.  Note that W can play J6 in sente because of the weakness at F6.]
;W[qf];B[qd];W[qi];B[qj]C[The R11-R10 exchange is not good for W.]
;W[nc];B[of]C[Good.];W[pb];B[qb];W[kc]C[Again, the L17-K17 exchange is better for B than for W.]
;B[jc];W[oe];B[pf];W[pe];B[qe];W[rf]
(;B[re]C[B should play Q11 instead (see variation).];W[pi]C[Q11 was the important point for both sides. Now B is no longer strong enough on the right.]

(;B[oi]C[B could prepare the attack with O14 first (see variation)]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[og];B[nf];W[ng];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[ni];B[oj]
;W[mh]C[This sequence to this point was frustrating. I was trying to kill the white group as I felt that he didn't really have the room, but as we played, I felt that going fo rthe kill was not getting me anywhere and I contented myself with progress at the top. How could I have played this better?

R: Making the opponent live on a very small scale is generally better than trying to kill and fail.  You cannot kill if you have weaknesses. Here you missed Q11 which would have completely changed the balance of power.]
;B[qn];W[hj];B[jl];W[jm];B[jk]LB[on:B][oo:A]TR[gl][hk][hl]C[In hind sight I feel this was the beginnings of my mistake with the bottom right. I feel I should have played at A or B instead of trying to save the marked stones.

R: if you are going to sacrifice the marked stones, you should have done it without doing the K8-K9 exchange.
For example, play L16 instead of K8. Even if you don't kill the top W group, you will build a lot of power thus transforming the top left into real territory.]
;W[on]C[Now white gets there first and my troubles start. I try to punch through and separate this white stone and I am unsuccessful. I think this exchange only makes things worse for my stones in the middle. By the time I come to my senses, I am in even deeper trouble here.

R:  B could simply play Q12 to take profit and ensure the life of the B group (see variation).]

(;B[po];W[oo];B[pp];W[pq];B[op];W[np];B[no];W[qo];B[pn];W[nn]

(;B[mo]C[Black could play O3 instead to take advantage of the W cutting points (see variations)]
;W[mn];B[om]C[If Black's intent is to defend the right group,  B Q12 is better.]
;W[mp];B[lo]LB[ml:A]TR[no][mo]C[I think I would have been better off to offer the marked stones as a sacrifice and play at A before white does?

R: if you planned to sacrifice O5, sacrifice only one stone and take advantage of the cutting points at O3 and R3. Black's strategy here is difficult to understand. If your goal was to captureK7, you should have simply played L7 much earlier, without sacrificing 3 stones.]
;W[ml];B[lm]C[Again, if Black's goal is to play L7, do not exchange M7 for O8 first, which weakens the right group. Play L7 directly.]
;W[nl];B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko];B[jo]C[So B ends up sacrificing 3 stones for very little gain.]
;W[kp];B[jp]LB[rj:B][rn:A]C[Here I am just following obediently along. I am trying to avoid problems with the bottom left but I have ignored the danger to my left side group. I feel I should have played A and B in sente to secure a room for eyes. Arrrrgh!!!

R: Black did not seem to have a strategy. You sacrificed 3 stones a help white construct power for very little in return.]
;W[rn];B[qm]C[Black should resist directly at S7 instead. R7 makes an empty triangle causing a shortage of liberties.]

(;W[ld];B[kb];W[jb];B[lb];W[ib];B[ke]C[So I've given up on the bottom right. But the loss of a group this size hurts a lot. I have now focused on trying to gain some compensation at the top. After this move I plan to try to attack the remain white stones at the top.]
