C[Hello my name Jump.
I'm play white.
Thank for your time.
Please forgive me if my english is bad.(I'm thais).

These game before i play i want to
1 keep sente
2 keep influence
3 base

But I forgot that I don't know how to handle with the invasion
so influence useless because my base ruins.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd]C[nothing to worry about so far];B[pj];W[np]LB[qn:a][jp:b]
[lq:c]C[Now you have started a potential fight - what is you r plan? Likely sequence is white a, black b; though you need to be aware of black c. If c, what do you do?]

(;B[nq]
(;W[on]C[you have effectively ignored the contact play. when there is contact (and a shoulder hit is a form of comntact) you need to eitehr knpw that your play was kikashi and thewrefore you canm treat the stone as light and let it be captiured as you will get compensation elsewhere, OR you need to strengthen it. I would have played]

All balck's stones are connected and alive. Are you sure the SEQUENCE that followes leaves you with sente?]
;B[qm];W[rm]C[you responded to black so your move was not sente (for it to be sente black shouild respond. Your move (34) was good, but black had a more powerful move - you responded!.]

A or B is as important as 52];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[db]

(;W[qc]C[why 58?]
(;B[nb];W[hq]LB[lc:A]C[you can't play 58 on 3,3 point, and then let pblack play 59 and ignoire it - it's too big. A black play at A after your 60 weakend both 54 and 34, 40.]
;B[jq]LB[cc:A][jd:B][jc:c]C[where are black's weak groups? what can you attack? answer, not much
Whaite at A and B are urgent.If white A, then Black B or C looks possible.]

(;W[io];B[oj]C[Black 63 is odd, and IO think what folows is largely a result of you both playing odd moves.]
;W[lp]LB[jd:A]C[why 64? A is still urgent];B[lq]C[what were you planning to do with 64? is this to connect 6, 10, 8, and 30? a fair approach.]

Indeed, I think that if i keep that group alive I still lost, am i right?
(I never know how to count point if it in the middle or not very end
I can't find web page that teach these skill while it not at game over)

I thank you very much for your time
I think you are very kind. see you.

you need to develop reading - learn to read out what might happen.

you need to look at the whole board, and have a plan.])

First,I think I should play
high for influence
but I play too high ^^
