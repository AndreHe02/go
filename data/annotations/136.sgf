;B[qe];W[jd];B[cj];W[cn];B[cg];W[fe]C[This move does not  attack black, does not take territory (E17  invasion looks possible), and does not defend.  Better to play solidly at  E17  or F17]
;B[dl]C[a waste of a move];W[bl]C[this is not urgent.  Black should  have played at C8.  The fact that he  did not means he will have to patch at B8 some time in the future.  I.e., 2  moves to do the work of one.  However, for you to punish him now is too  small.   You are only helping to strengthen black this way.  Since the corner is open  at C3, you cannot expect to take territory this way.  Better to take a big  point elsewhere.]
;B[bk];W[cl]C[B7 would be more solid.];B[dk];W[nq]C[good.];B[pn];W[pk]C
[I think this is an overplay.  You now have two weak groups to  look  after.  K4 would be better here.]
;B[ld]C[I would have played R11 here as  black.  Take territory while  attacking.]
;W[jf]C[Not urgent.  R12 or R13 here is more important.];B[lf];W[qg]C[Good.  Black lets you get this point anyway.]
;B[pg];W[ph]C[Tough to try  and fight here in black's strong area.  I would play R12  instead.]
;B[qh]C[Good for black.];W[qi];B[rh];W[og];B[pf];W[ri];B[oh];W[pi];B[rg]
;W[qm]C[Black came out way ahead in that fight.  I think this move  only helps  black again.  Why not simply capture P12 in the ladder?]
;B[qn];W[qq]C[Very  greedy.  K4 seems much bigger.];B[pq];W[qo]C[I don't think this works.  Black  could simply play R4 now.]

C[This move does not really attack black as the  corner is dead.  I would  play to make a base for the O3 group.]
;B[nm]M[nm]C[Black has no need to escape  here as the corner is dead.  He should  have invaded the bottom.]
;W[ol];B[om];W[pm];B[on];W[jp]C[Finally!];B[fp];W[fn]C[D3 would attack and get territory.  F6 only attacks.]
;B[ho];W[jn];B[dn];W[dm]C[E5 looks better to me.];B[em];W[bm]C[Connect at C7 is urgent.]
;B[cm];W[hm];B[dm];W[co];B[eo];W[ep]C[This is aji keshi and only makes black  stronger.  F5 and E4 should be  kept open until you know which one you want.]
;B[fo];W[fq];B[gq];W[er]C[just  connect at E3 is a little better.];B[fr]
;W[eq];B[gr]C[These moves were  black's end-game gote.  Too small to take gote for  now.]
;W[ir]C[Seems bad just on principle.  Stay away from blacks thickness.   K3 or  K2 would be better, but neither is needed here ad the territory here is  pretty  small.]
;B[nh];W[nb]C[This invasion seems pretty risky.  Your right side group  is now pretty  weak too now that black has saved P12.  As black, I would hope to chase this  stone into your top left group, ruining any territory you hoped for there.]
;B[ob]C[Black should play M17 or M18 I think.];W[oc];B[nc];W[od];B[mb];W
[mc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[kc];B[lc];W[le];B[ke]C[Black should simply capture and  be done with it.]
;W[je];B[kf];W[kh]C[E17 looks like a good 25 point move  here.  L12 doesn't do much for you  at all.  No attack, no defend, no territory.]
;B[mk]C[Attacking the right  side.];W[nj];B[mi]C[N10 would have sealed you in for sure.]
;W[no];B[mj];W[kj]C[Your right side group doesn't have eye-shape yet.];B
[kk];W[ij];B[jk];W[km]C[The last 4-5 moves seem pointless to me.  No attack, no defend, no  territory gained.]
;B[kb]C[Aji keshi for black.];W[jb];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[pl];B[hk];W[hj]
