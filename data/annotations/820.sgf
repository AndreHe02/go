LB[eo:a][dn:b][hp:c]C[.This seems a little too close.  Ba, Wb, Bc can be expected adn this does not work well with the lower right.  .Probably a two-space low pincer is best..]
;B[ch]C[Too early. B misses his chance in the lower left.];W[nc]
LB[ep:a]C[Wa looks to good at this point.   I B is allowed to jump out not, after B11, there is no good place for W to play on the left because B11 undercuts the territory.]
;B[qf]LB[lc:a][jd:b]C[Extreme cowardice.  B must pincer.  Either 'a' or 'b' would be my choice.]
;W[pb];B[qc]LB[lc:a]C[I prefer 'a' to take advantage of the lower right.]
;W[kc];B[dl]LB[eo:a]C[Once again, 'a' is much better.];W[eo]
LB[ep:a][dq:b][do:c]C[Far too insipid.  either 'a' or Wb, Ba, Wc]
;B[dp];W[do];B[cq];W[bo];B[bp]LB[bq:a]C[Better just to play 'a'.]
;W[co];B[ek]C[B's corner is not yet alive.];W[bq];B[br];W[ap]
;B[ar];W[er]LB[dr:a]C['a' is better, threatening a double atari]
;B[dr];W[fr];B[ds]C[JB: i feel i am doing well up to here.His move at E9 was not worth giving me the opportunity to close him in in the corner.

SGF. Considering that W30 at 31 would have pretty much finished off the corner W cannot be considered to be doing well.  If W now tries to save W8 there is a good cahnce that B will end up with a large central moyo]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[di]LB[cj:a][ej:b]C[THese 2 moves by W are very heavy. 'a' is better than W36 at it theratens to connect underneath.  B would be reluctant to push at 36 because W would answer at 'b']
;B[dg]LB[bk:a]C[It is probably better to connect the B stones together with 'a' and leave the 3 W stones floating.]
;W[cj]C[With this one more W takes the lead on the left 'a' and 'b' are now miai so B's 2 stones are isolated.]
;B[on]LB[cl:a][cg:b];W[mn]LB[kp:a]C[MAybe a little ambitious. 'a' is safer.  Because of the weakness of the 2 B stones to the left W need not worry about a B moyo.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[pq];B[rr];W[qr];B[rq];W[fl]C[JB: would G9 be better?

SGF:  Probably not.  It may force B to run into the W moyo below.  These B stones are not going to die.]
;B[fk]C[.];W[gl];B[gk];W[hk]LB[hl:a]C[JB:  is this bad?

SGF:  Yes  It leaves an unnecessary cutting point,  At the moment W has better prospects.  I would simpley extend to 'a'.  B would not have the time to reduce the moyo until the 4 stones are stabilized.]

C[
 medot started observation.];B[jm]LB[eg:a][df:b][gi:c]C[These B stones are probably not going to be caught so this is a big swing in the balance of territories.  Wa, Bb, Wc looks the msot proimising now,]
;W[jl]C[JB: from here, i am not sure what goes wrong.  i know it is bad that i come out of the ensuing sequence in gote.]
;B[km]
(;W[im]C[JB: M8 better?

SGF: Definitely, much better.];B[in];W[il];B[mm]LB[eg:a][gi:b]
C[JB: things begin to go off the rials for me here...

SGF:  Now that the W stones in the center are stronger the 'a', 'b' combination show earlier will kill the 5 B stones.  So W should play to secure his stones in sente.  It is hard to see how W will get a lot of territory at the bottom unless B goes back to pprotect the 5 stones so he shold not end up taking a small part of  it in gote..]
;W[nn];B[nm]C[.];W[ln];B[lm];W[hn]LB[jo:a][jn:b][eg:c]C[Wa, Bb Wc looks most promising.]
;B[ko];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[jp];B[ip];W[kp];B[eg]LB[cl:a]
[fi:b][cg:c]C[W made the mistake of not securing sente.  However, connecting with 'a' still threatens 'b' and the cut at 'c' is left behind so the situation could be much worse.  Because of this W probably stil has a slight edge, but it is only a small one.]
;W[fi]C[.];B[gi];W[fh];B[hj];W[fg];B[hg]LB[cl:a]C[W is achieving nothing with these moves.  He is probably still going to have to go back to 'a' ar some point.  All these moves do is strengthen B.]
;W[cg]C[bad i think];B[cf];W[bg];B[bf];W[bi];B[ic]LB[bk:a]C[If Ba, W has only one eye and so would have to run away   B would then secure the top in the natural flow of moves.]
;W[gc];B[fb]C[The exchange of W96 for B97 seems to ignore the situation on the left.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[gb]LB[bk:a]C[B has lost his chance to play 'a' with any expectation of  killing W but 'a' is still a threat.  B must not play in such as way as to eliminate this threat.]

[pi:b][ol:c][pk:d][ok:e]C[JB: i feel like i am losing now. On top of it, i have used to much time and can not avoid a time forfeit.

SGF:  Yes.  W is losing.  Forcing B to play at 119 seals it.  W needs to be more subtle.  The central B stones do nothave eye space so W needs to attack them indirectly.  Simple moves will not work.    I would try 'a'  After this  Bb would be answered by Wc and Bd or Be would be answered by Wb.  W may not stand a good chance in such a fight, but it is better than nothing.  The ability to conjure something out of nothing is what marks the stronger player.]

SGF:  There were two turning points in this game: W52 and B83.  The first of these was a bad move which allowed B to get back into the game.  The second of this was a missed opportunity by W which allowed B to pretty much seal the result.]
