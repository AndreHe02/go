C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. My opponent was 2d, but I was an even game (handicap games have a rather different style of play that I find don't really help me improve as much as even games).

But this game went in quite an unexpected direction. Perhaps my opponent just had a a bad day, but I've felt more pressure from a 3k than in this particular game.

However, I'm still going to work on the following assumptions for this review:
1. W's general direction of play / strategy are possible
2. W's attempts at invasions / reductions are possible

My thoughts are that his failures are more due to special circumstances and mistakes on his part. Thus, please help point out the correct sequence / circumstances where his plays WOULD have worked.

Cheers,
Lib];B[pd]C[B: Hi, I'm Biondy. About 2-3d in strength and will be your reviewer. Enjoy the review :)

I wanted to add aji for the 2 W groups. Is this the right way to do it?

;W[ml];B[kg];W[jg];B[jh]C[
After this, the results give me the feeling that the aji (i.e.L9) has been wasted. Is K12 a bad move? Is it the only move for B?

Bad invasion by W? Or can it work under certain circumstances? How else can W reduce B's moyo?

Another trap]
(;B[ah]C[
W resigned at this point. Somehow I didn't feel much pressure from W's play.

I'm bound to have made lots of mistakes, and that was why I chose to play an even game against a dan player, so that he can help spot and show me my mistakes. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. So please help point out as many of my mistakes as possible, and which areas that I need to focus on (my fighting skills? Opening? Tsumego?)

Thanks once again for reviewing my game!
Lib

B: I think white was over eager since the very beginning. The failure for him over the fight on the right side probably trigger this.

I think you played very well. Keep on practicing tsumego and look over pro games at their opening and the feel of the game and I guess you can get stronger in near time.

Hope you enjoy the review.])
