RE[W+5.50]

C[Zander: I felt like I was dominating most of this game, but didn't get much to show for it.  In the end I eked out a small win with the komi.  Thanks for your comments.]

(;W[cj];B[pn];W[oo]C[Zander: I think black is playing too small, so I'm happy to play w8 away and consider abandoning Q5 for moyo elsewhere, but decide to save it.

Peterium: Tenuki after Q5 is undesirable. Black strengthens corner territory, starts attacking white, and may build more territory that way.]

(;B[pp];W[jp]C[Peterium: Good choice, leave P5 for taste later.]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[Peterium: Correct response. Make the F3 stone heavy, then start attacking it, since you have K4]

;B[cc]C[Peterium: Bad choice. White has a lot of influence at the bottom already, this will enable white to gain significant influence towards the entire board.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[cb]C[Zander: I often would play C15 instead.  I don't know which is better to kill (if either), but I guess this lets black grab more territory on the left.

Peterium: White cannot kill. Enclosing black is the best white can do. C18 is unreasonable, and too greedy.]
