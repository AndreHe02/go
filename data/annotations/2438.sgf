;B[pp]C[Hello,
first time submiting a game. I've just recently (December 2002) started
to play Go and have mostly been reading about it (Elementary Go Series
by Davies). So i've begun to play more about 30 games now (on MSN game
zone) and keep finding myself feeling good at the start then torn to
shreads. I'm poor at attacking and fights seem to always go against me.
Any pointers would be great, i'm sure i'll improve with experience but
i'm eager for some advice. I'm not ranked but i'm assuming around 30K.
I find my biggest problem (among many at this point) is the idea of
sente and knowing what a certain plays imply (in the start). 212 moves
in total.

Thanks in advance...

(;B[mc]TR[la][ma][na][oa][pa][mb][nb][ob][pb]C[The
first rule of go is to claim the largest piece of territory available
when your stones are not under attack. N17 stone allows you to claim
around 9 points as well as helping to reinforce the Q17 stone. However,
with the R15 stone, this corner is already secure and under no danger.
This early in the game, you should play at a more open area or put
pressure on white stones. I've put up one suggestion of how the game
could proceed.]
(;W[je]C[H: Is he jumping out in case a approach at F17 G17?

Actually,
an approach at F17 or G17 by black would already be disadvantagerous to
black because of D16 and K17. (2 white stones vs 1 black stone) K15 is
totally unnecessary for preventing invasion from black.];B[cj]
;W[ch];B[cn];W[cl]C[H: Guess my C10 stone should have been at C9.

No.
C10 and C6 are fine at this early stage of play. White influence is
still not that strong. You can even ignore that move and place your
move elsewhere like around R10 or K3 to gain territory. However, if you
decide to fight, I've included a suggestion at move 17.];B[dk]
C[H: panic! :)

No this is a good move.];W[dm];B[dn];W[em]
(;B[cp]C[Ack!!! Now this is a mistake.];W[cq];B[bp];W[en];B[do]
C[H: bad form i assume. Empty triangle.

In this case, its not so bad since you can threaten the white stones at D4 and C3 as well as making an eye.]
;W[ep];B[eo]
(;W[fo]C[Bad move by white. Exposes many cutting points at F4, F6 and D3. White would be better off if he just connected at F4.]

(;B[jp]C[H: i wanted to play the cut at F4 but didn't have the marbles. Figured it wouldn't be a wise move without some support.

You can pressure white if you cut.];W[hp]
(;B[cc]C[H: Noticed he hand double wing so i figured i would take some space before he got a chance to back it up.

A
corner is worth about only 10 points. Also, by reacting to your stone
at C17, it gives white the chance to reinforce its surrounding stones
and put pressure on your stones at C10 and D9. You should claim the
large piece of open territory on the right first.

On a side
note, the 3-3 point is not the only way to barge into a corner. The 5-2
point is also possible. I've shown 2 variations.];W[dc];B[cd]

C[H: i decided i would give it a try and attempt to attack the H17 area.

Its
highly unlikely you'll succeed. There are many white stones surrounding
your lone black stones. Even if you manage to make 2 eyes, white would
have taken the opportunity to take more territory. Again, remember rule
1. When your stones are safe, look for the biggest possible open
territory.];W[df];B[ee];W[fd];B[ff];W[eg];B[hf];W[gh];B[hd]

Even
if you manage to run away, white has already efficiently captured the
top and the left side, both with potential to expand even more.]

he does.];B[rf];W[rg];B[sg];W[qh];B[rh]C[These are all small points.
The biggest point for black now would probably be Q7.];W[qg]
;B[pm];W[ki]C[H: Is there any hope for the middle?

You can still run and make 2 eyes but white would gain an enormous advantage by harrassing you all the way.]

is too far from H7. (I assume you want to save the center.) However, if

contain.];B[qs]C[H:

At this point i decided i would resign (was starting to get quite

wasn't feeling up to it after getting beat up in the corner. Thanks for
any comments.

There are 2 things that I noticed about this game.

First, black is too attack oriented. There were several opportunities for
black to gain territory just by placing a stone on an open area.
Instead, black chooses to attack.

Second, black does not know when to sacrifice. For example, black could have sacrificed the 2 stones at D15 and E15 and played in another area. Instead, black chooses to continue playing with a group that is obviously heavily surrounded by opponent's stones. That gave white the chance to acquire territory and gain influence all around the board  while putting
pressure on that group.

This is the end of the review. Should there be any questions, feel free to drop me an email.
