AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Please review for black - I lost by only a few points.



When talking about the game after we played, white said I was playing timidly.



Thank you.

My first review!  I hope I can help you.];W[jp];B[fq];W[nq]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[cn]
(;B[bp]C[I'd prefer to put more pressure on the c6 stone.  See the variation.]
;W[cf]
(;B[fd]C[Now that you have played b4 and white left, you really should separate his stones.  f16 just allows white to defend his stones.  See variation.]
;W[dj]
(;B[ch]C[Ok, now you move here, but white is much better off already.  I think if you want to invade, pick c8 since that corner is stronger (fight where you are strong).  But I think maybe a moyo move like k10 might be best.]
;W[cj];B[eg]C[I think if you want outside thickness d14 is the normal move.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[ce]C[Bad shape, also aji-keshi.  Just play b18, and white must make life.  You will surely get sente to play elsewhere.]
;W[be];B[df];W[cb];B[dc]C[Now you can see the effect of the bad shape move, c15, and of not playing b18.  This is a disaster!]
;W[bg];B[cg];W[bf];B[bh]C[This is an endgame move!

Alternatives: k10, n4, q14.];W[qf];B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[od]
;W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[I think here you are too concerned about your own territory.  I would play q8.]
;W[rl]C[As white I would play q8, now black has a chance to play it...]
;B[rm];W[pl]C[Black defended his 11 point corner, but white got a 3 stone wall with potential for 25 points on the side!]

(;B[lq]C[Your corner is strong, so you want to erase the white territory.  Seems reasonable, but I would suggest a move around p14.]
;W[lp];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[kp]
(;B[iq]C[Oops, not a good result.  See variation.];W[lr];B[mr]
;W[mq];B[ls];W[jr];B[ir];W[ks];B[or]C[This move is endgame now.]
;W[nr];B[oq];W[os];B[rc]C[Why not s16?];W[rd];B[lc]C[Play p14 first.]
;W[hd]C[Ah, the light invasion.  A good point to estimate the score:



Black   UR corner = 18

LR corner = 10

LL corner = 20

top       = ?

48 + top



White

UL corner = 8

bottom    = 9

right     = 25?

left      = 10?

52



So the game is somewhat close, but if black just manages to make a few points on the top or in the middle from chasing h16, he should  win!  White must also be carefull that in the fight he doesn't lose too much on the right.]

(;B[hc]C[Seems ok, I think maybe j17 would be better.];W[ic]
;B[gc]C[Being forced to defend h17 shows why it's not usually good to touch the stones you're attacking.]
;W[jc]C[White  should play lightly, maybe j14.  k17 doesn't threaten black, doesn't help white that much.]

(;B[kc]C[A very bad move I think.  Doesn't hurt white's shape much at all.  See variation for a very strong attack.]
;W[kd]C[This exchange helps white a lot!];B[ld]C[Maybe m15 would be faster?]
;W[ke];B[ge]C[Are you defending this group?  It's very alive, and there aren't many points here.  The right side is the side to play on so you can reduce the white right territory.]
;W[he];B[fc]C[Not necessary!];W[gf]
(;B[ff]C[?  You are strong here.  Cut him with h14.];W[gg];B[fg]
C[Not necessary to defend, if you want to separate d10 and g13, just play e11, it's faster.  But the urgent part of the board is around p14!]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[le]C[A big point, don't let white close this off!!]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[cl]C[Locally I think b8 is better...];W[dm];B[bn]
;W[bm];B[co];W[cm];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[fm];B[en];W[em];B[fn]
C[You look like you are defending 6 points or so here, you should be very worried about white's center!]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[gn];B[go];W[hn];B[fo]C[?  Not necessary.]
;W[gj]C[For White I think o14 bigger.];B[fi];W[gi];B[di]C[?  Defending 3 points gote?]
;W[fk];B[me]C[Finally, lucky white didn't play here first.]

(;W[mf]C[I think it's better to play on the other side...];B[nf]
;W[mg];B[ng]
(;W[nh]C[And this should be just n12.  White is not strong enough to play this way.]

;W[do];B[cp]C[At least take the KO once, to make white lose threats.]

;B[tt]C[In the opening I think you could have done better on the left side.



Several times you defended small territory, many times when there wasn't even any danger.



Then white played a light invasion on the top.  After missing a good chance to destroy his shape (play k15 instead of l17), you defended the d16 group too many times, and white built influence in the center.



Then black should have broken into the center, especially around then n15 area, which would also reduce the white left.



Next, white lost half his left side group (oops!  :-)



And finally, both white and black overlooked the huge mistake of white playing c19, when black could have killed the corner.



I hope my comments help you!])
