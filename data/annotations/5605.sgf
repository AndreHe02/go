AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[In fact I need some ideas of white openning in handicap games... I've marked some moves, that I think are bad...
thx in advance, marcin

-- 
I think the biggest problem in your handicap game is that you fix the shape too quickly. It would be better to play "a bit everywhere", and have good shapes instead of closed living group. The problem when you make a group live is that usually, you will have to strengthen black too. By doing so, you will lose the potential to cut hit later and attack the pieces. In other words, you should play more lightly and with more flexibility.

Yann, aka linfir]PL[W];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[ql];W[qj]C[slow, passive move?

-- 
No, this is proper (honte). After this, your group is settled and you can play elsewhere.]
;B[lq]
(;W[ne]LB[pb:B][nc:A][qc:C]TR[fc][cf][cn]C[too slow?

-- 
This is a bad move. If black simply answers at A, the exchange will correct black's shape and it doesn't do much for white.

Instead, you should play on the empty big points, and aim at A, B or C later.]
;B[nd];W[qc]LB[nd:B][ne:A]C[again, too small?

--
Yes, this is small, almost big yose. Moreover, the exchange A for B is good for black. And it is a bit strange not to answer B.]
;B[pc]
(;W[rd]LB[re:A]C[-- 
This a point of technique : A is better (see variation). 

The reason is that if black answers at A, you have to live small in gote in the corner, and the descent of A lose many points on the side.]
;B[me];W[re]C[-- 
You spent two moves to get the corner, this is really slow.]
;B[nf];W[oe]C[-- 
Right, you cannot let black get a ponnuki.];B[od];W[mf]C[-- 
This cut is bad. At best you can hope to catch one stone, and it will strengthen black a lot on the top.

You should tenuki and play a big point instead.];B[lf];W[mg]
;B[ld]
(;W[fc]LB[cf:B][cn:A][fq:C]TR[ld][nd][me][lf]C[-- 
Compare this position with the one you would have had if you had not cut, but played here directly. Now black has a lot of strength...

Also, it might be better to play in a more open area.];B[hc]

(;W[fe]C[-- 
There are other possibilities, maybe a bit better, see variations.]
;B[ec];W[hd];B[id];W[he]
(;B[ml]LB[df:B][lg:A]C[-- 
This black move is too vague. A is almost double-sente and prevents a future connection. And B defends the corner and severly attacks white's stones. (see variation).]
;W[ni]LB[kf:B][lg:A][ng:C]C[-- 
This is too slow, and quite vague. Locally, white A-black B-white C is good to remove the aji.

But here, I think you should tenuki, and either settle your stones on the top or take a big point.]
;B[cg];W[cl]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[-- 
This is too soft, and black answered correctly. You should rather play at A or B.]
;B[cn];W[ci]C[-- 
You have another group, not totally settled, and black has sente and can make a huge moyo on the bottom. This is not good.]
;B[gq]LB[eq:A]C[-- 
A is better (the corner is safe).];W[qq]C[-- 
I don't think this is good. Black is going to have a very strong moyo on the bottom. I think this is too early.]
;B[qp]LB[pq:A]C[-- 
Wrong direction ! If black had answered at A, the result would be much better for him...]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[nr];B[mr]
;W[ps]C[-- 
This move isn't necessary ; the corner was already alive.];B[gn]
C[-- 
This is getting rather difficult for white. The bottom (except for the left san-san) is already black's territory...]
;W[ol]
(;B[nn]C[-- 
Black is afraid... He should counter attack instead, see variation.]
;W[jn];B[jp]LB[jl:A]C[-- 
Again. Black should play at A.];W[ln];B[nm];W[kk];B[in];W[jm]
;B[eg]C[-- 
This is a good move.];W[gh];B[gl];W[ij];B[il];W[jl];B[el];W[ek]
;B[dk];W[ej];B[dl];W[ck]
(;B[di]C[-- 
If black pushes and cut instead of this bad move, white loses a lot.]
;W[dj]TR[fc][hd][fe][he][ci][ej][ck][ek][cl]C[-- 
After that, except if black tries to cut off one of the marked group (and he doesn't), then the game is in yose. 

I will not comment the yose, as it is not very important at this level compared to the fuseki or chuban.]
