C[Hello, this is niko.
I am a german 6k and the reviewer of our game.
As there were no comments in the game I focused on the things I noticed.
I tried to make my comments short and clear, if tere are any further questions, feel free to ask.
The most important mistakes from black are made in the opening, by wrong direction of play or following a strategy which does not fit well to the situation on the board.]
;B[pd];W[mq]C[strange];B[dd];W[cd]LB[cc:A][ce:B]C[A or B are joseki]
(;B[de]C[this leads to a less favorable result for black:]
(;W[ce];B[df]TR[cf]C[this may be ok, if you want the side, but I would prefere the marked point as ist puts pressure on white]
(;W[pp]C[good point for white, but right now, I would prefere to play at D17, because it is sente and you can come back here afterwards. (see var.)]
;B[jd]TR[cc][dp]C[too small at this point of the game. There is much more potential in the corners. 
Before playing on the sides it is most often wise to check if there are open corners.]
;W[jj]C[strange, as white does not have a mojo where this stone can work with.
Your chance to get 2 more corners and the lead of the game (see var.)]
(;B[dp];W[cq]TR[cn][fq][gq]C[strange, it would be better for white to use his stones on the right to build up a framework
by attacking on the outside, maybe even from the other side...]
(;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[br];B[en];W[jq];B[dj]LB[cc:B]
[cf:A]TR[af][ag][bg][ah][bh][ai][bi][ci]C[this move is very small! Because of the white stones the left side is already very open. If you want to have the left side you will have to play A first in order to seal it. But then white will come out at the top side. As this side hase more potential, you may either want to seal the top side (and get the corner) with B and then expand to the right side maybe at Q10]
(;W[cf]
(;B[dh]TR[cg]C[if you still want to get points on the left side you have to seal it! This move makes no points!]

;W[jg];B[mc]TR[pj]C[this is importatant, but if white now plays at Q10 you have a problem. This side should be taken from black earlier in the game]
(;W[qf];B[ph]C[the piner is a good choice! So you can prevent the big white framework.]

;B[cc]C[yes];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ca]C[to slow];W[ba]C[but white answers. So it was ok, white could have tenuki, maybe at G3 that would have been a big move..]
