Agreed. The shape looks nicer. I think you should also have considered a pincer around R8. Playing again on the bottom seems a bit overconcentrated.]

;B[ng]SQ[ja][jb][jd][je][jf][kg][lg][mg]C[wasnt sure if this move was needed but i did it to create some moyo up top around

It's an important move. It's on the boundary of both your moyos. These sorts of points are usuall quite crucial.]
;W[oj];B[em];W[ek];B[gl]
(;W[cc]C[once he played this i was hurt cause i was planing the invasion around c14 then a jump in at c17 see the variation

Yes. I think you should have invaded before playing even E7. Notice how W's response of E9 makes an invasion harder.]
;B[cg]C[i know this is very deep but i feel like i cant let him have this corner.

Yes, very deep. And too risky I'd say. D13 would have been less dangerous.]

Yep. This is a very large mistake. Your group should die now.]

It's not time for that yet! You need to keep E5 from connecting to C6! D5 is urgent.]
