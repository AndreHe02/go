;B[pc];W[cp];B[oq];W[qo]LB[qp:a]C[Unusual. Your move leaves black some space to potentially jump into the corner himself. I think joseki would be R4.

However, I think I'd recommend playing a move in the unoccupied top left corner before this.]
;B[pe]C[Likewise, black might here play in the top left.];W[dc]
;B[ep];W[lq]LB[qq:a][np:b]C[If this is intended as an attack on the black stone at P3, I don't think it will work. Black can probably dive into the corner at R3, making enough space for life. So black can probably afford to ignore your attack, knowing that if you continue attacking around O4 he has that option.

So, white should probably respond to black's approach to the lower left.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[iq];W[dk]LB[ce:a]C[OK, but maybe white should consider a corner enclosure around about C15, making a fair amount of pretty secure territory in the corner.]
;B[dh];W[jc]LB[ce:a]C[I definitely feel a response at around C15 would be an idea here, not letting black establish himself on the left (which he does with his next more) whilst simultaneously taking territory.]
;B[de];W[lo]LB[np:a][oo:b]C[Fair enough, that stone was looking a bit vulnerable, but I would have considered a more aggressive way of running with it. Perhaps leaning on the black stone at P3 by playing O4. Remember, black's stone here is also weak, so this aggressive move may well make black passively jump into the corner, allowing white to link up with a move like P5.

Linking weak stones together is one was to eliminate weakness.]

;W[fm]TR[oq][pp][po][pn][qn]LB[nq:a][op:b][cm:c]C[At this moment, easily the weakest black stones are the group in the lower left. They have no eyes, and cannot be easily connected to friendly stones. I feel an attack against them is in order. At the same time, I would advise some safety play and would suggest you make sure your 2 white stones are safe. Perhaps a move that helps with both goals would be at O3, linking the white stones to the group on the right, whilst simultaneously destroying any chances black has of an eye at P4.

Your move at F7 does not seem to accomplish anything; it attacks nothing and it makes no territory. In that part of the board, something around C7 might be appropriate, making sure your stone at D9 is connected to the bottom left, and securing some territory.]
;B[in]LB[gp:a]C[If black wishes to make his group at the bottom safe, something like G4 would probably be better, simple preventing a white invasion.]
;W[il]C[The black group below is not really in trouble, so again I'd recommend focusing on the black group that IS weak: the one in the lower right.]
;B[jm];W[jl]LB[lm:a]C[Black seems to be attempting to connect those 2 groups on the bottom, so a splitting move at about M7 might be appropriate, keeping black separated.]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[qk];B[lm];W[ll];B[ml];W[pj];B[lc];W[ke]
;B[gc]TR[dc][de][dh]C[I'm unsure about this. While it makes the stone at D17 lonely, white can split this stone at G17 off from the 2 on the left. Those 2 stones may yet turn out to be weak and vulnerable.]
;W[ce]LB[fd:a]C[One idea would be attempting to capture the black stone with a move like F16. This would also split black appart, making it more likely that something belonging to black will die.

When 2 weak groups are under attack, chances are good you'll be able to kill one of them.

I feel this is a very critical part of this game. As it turns out, black gets a very good, strong result here, and I don't feel he deserved it.]

;B[hb];W[ha];B[fa]C[A nice tesuji from black.];W[ga];B[ia];W[da]
;B[fa];W[fh]C[White can't really expect much in the way of territory here in the centre. Black can simply throw stones into the middle of it, knowing he should be able to connect them to the very strong black group at the top.]
;B[ie]C[Threatening to cut through white's kiema (knight's move extension).]
;W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[le];W[lf];B[kd]C[And the kiema is cut.]

(;B[ef]LB[lp:a][mq:c][nr:b]TR[or][pr][pq]C[Here black could have played M4. If white connects at N4, black can play atari at O2. If white responds to that atari, black can then pick off white's 3 capturing stones at the bottom.

See variation.

The larger white group would also probably be dead after this sequence, being totally cut off and with no eye space.

So, white would be forced to simply give up 4 stones and play something like N3.]

(;W[jq]LB[fp:a][jo:b]TR[dq][ep][eo]C[White should play a ko threat (a large threat elsewhere on the board) so that if black responds, white can retake to ko and once again threaten the huge capture.

There aren't many candidates, unfortunately. Perhaps E4, which threatens to descend into black's territory, probably capturing 3 black stones and considerably enlarging white's territory.

See variation for precisely how this would work if black ignored the ko threat and made the ko safe with something like K5.]

;B[sd];W[ob];B[ra];W[na];B[pa];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[To summarise, I think you maybe need to be observant regarding connection; both yours and your opponents. If groups are split apart, they are vulnerable to attack, so connect your own and split your opponent's.

A few of your moves seemed to have neither an attacking role or a territorial role; remember, territory is easiest made in the corners and on the sides, so make sure your territory in those areas is secure before attempting to build in the centre.

For me, the critical point of the game was black's invasion at G17 on move 51. I think it had to be attacked. Because it wasn't, black connected 2 of his groups, giving him a huge advantage in that part of the board.

Another critical point was move 194, which really should have been a ko threat.]
