 girodias 6k*: I need to reload];W[ce];B[dc];W[fd];B[fc];W[gc]C[An alternative could be white E16, E17, G16, H17 and  then white extend to C9 or C6
the idea would be to use blacks submissiveness with F17 and push black one  step further
compared to the common joseki with White E16 instead of F16. But this  strategy is perhaps
more interesting when white has a position in the lower left.   With G17 i guess you are trying to get control of the upper side, and I  cannot see any
wrong in that here. I do not now any josekis from this move so my further  comments should be
compared with what you can find elsewhere.];B[ed];W[fb];B[ec];W[gd];B[ef]
;W[dg];B[ci];W[eg]C[I think this is a possible push because it defend aginst the  cut at Bd14 etc and blacks
answer is neutralized by F16 G16.

An alternative could be to play the  diagonal move at e12 and try to avoid  helping the
black group to get out, but I am not sure which is best.];B[ff];W[bc]C[Good move, now black has very little eyespace and whites group  is safe.]
;B[cb]C[This move look ineffective, black should play in the center  and save the aji of bB18 or this
move.];W[bb]C[Perhaps white could play elsewhere but black has probably lost  in this exchange so white
can be happy with the small advantage of bC18 wB18.];B[cc]C[This move has to  be a mistake. If white answers this move whites shape become stronger
and black will not gain anything at all since he can make an eye without C17.  This
is a sente move with negative value for black.];W[cd]C[This is a simple and  enough. It helps white and it removes the possibility of a black eye
at D16. The only drawback is that perhaps could try to play at B13 instead  and get a
better result, but white can be satisfied anyway.];B[bg];W[cf]C[This move  look is safe and threaten a furikawari with wE15. Perhaps white could try  wD14, D15,
B14 instead - blacks shape is the same but white get more from the move at  B14 instead of C14.]
;B[df];W[cg];B[bh]C[Instead of bD14 black could have played bC13, wD14 and  F15 I think both of the black
stones in that sequence do more work. Now the stone at D14 is useless.]
;W[fg]C[I think this is better than playing wH14, bF13 because this stone makes  wD10 into a strong  move.]
;B[gf];W[ie];B[if];W[jf];B[he];W[hd]C[wJ16 looks better but black have no  time to use the defects at j16 and k15 so it does not
matter this time.];B[jg];W[ig]C[Black should simply play J13 instead of k13  followed by white K15 then black has sente and
no defects.];B[hf];W[je];B[jh];W[dj]C[Good];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[fj];B[ek]
;W[fk];B[dk];W[fi]C[Instead of this move I  would prefer to pull out the stone at j13 with H12, J12 or K11.
I cannot say what will happen but this can be a good chance to end the game.  If whites group
is shut in it can live with A16.];B[hh];W[ii];B[ih];W[gg]C[This move is always sente and since black cannot play here white  should save it as a very
big kothreat.];B[hg];W[eb];B[bf];W[hi]C[Whites attack is perhaps a little bit  too early and should perhaps play some big point
instead, but I am too weak to know exactly what white should do here.];B
[be];W[bd];B[pf];W[qf];B[qg];W[qe];B[ph]C[Black should play Q13 putting  pressure at P16 in sente]

;W[ld];B[le];W[me];B[ke]C[I think black should play L16 instead and escape easier.]

;W[nj];B[mj];W[pj];B[nk];W[oj];B[lj];W[of]C[Even if there was some move for white  to kill black or get a better result this is a good
result without uneccessary complications. One should always be patient when  hunting a
weak group and not tru too much.];B[ql];W[fq]C[Good the black stones in the  right side is not important]
;B[fp]C[This move seems not to fit this position it forces white to ruin the  lower side. Perhaps
a pincer is the only way to fight or bD2 to keep the left side and attack  white. It is to
early to attack the white group above so black should make white weak on the  lower side.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[jq];B[rj];W[nq]C[I think white is  leading with komi (plus minus 10 points...)]
;B[lq]C[White cannot allow  black to take the corner so perhaps wO3 should have been at N3 instead.
Now I think white has to attach at q3 or invade at R3 and I think that Q3 is  more fun :-)]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[kq];B[mr];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[jr]C[Normally in this kind of  shape black cuts at o4, but this is perhaps different when black
only has a stone at the 4-4 point, but this could be a mistake.];W[nr];B
[ls];W[ir];B[iq];W[hr];B[ip];W[jo];B[js];W[io]C[I first thought that the hane at  J2 was bad but this result is good.]
;B[np];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[lo];W[pq];B[jp];W[hp];B[kp];W[qp]C[Overkill - R6 should do the job too I think]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[er]C[Now white is clearly leading so black should cut at H5  or try an immidiate doubleattack on
white two groups. White cannot live on the side anyway (well I am not sure  but it looks
impossible thanks to bK1)];W[gn];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[fm];B[fn];W[hn];B[il]
