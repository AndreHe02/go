;B[dj];W[jq];B[qn];W[ql];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr]C[[jasons\] This next move is a big mistake on white's part. There was no reason to let black ruin his moyo on the bottom]

(;W[pn];B[oq]TR[pd]C[[jasons\] Because of the marked black stone, white has only limited potential on the right. Black has gotten the better of this trade.]
;W[qo];B[nq];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd]LB[jd:A][nc:B]C[[jasons\] In this case the wide kikari does not work so well for white. He gives black solid territory in the corner and only makes the small extension to 'A'. If he had had a stone at 'B' as well, then this would have worked well.]
;B[cg];W[jd];B[lc]LB[nc:A]C[[jasons\] But since there was no stone at 'A', black can make a perfect extension checking white's progress.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pi]C[[jasons\] The contact combination just helps white. The territory in the corner is still open for invasion, but white's corner profit is not small.]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[kd];B[kc];W[mf]C[[jasons\] Good moves on white's part. He has now built up significant influence in the center, and should be able to turn a lot of it into secure profit. The corner in the upper right is still open to invasion so, black can only count on 20 or so points on the top.]
;B[hq]LB[jo:A][hp:B]C[[jasons\] I would say that this is the turning point. White's answer at 'A', although a traditional response, forced him into an unnecessarily weak postion to due surounding context. I've added a variation at 'B' that I think may have played better.]

(;W[jo];B[ho]C[[jasons\] it feels like black has gotten off way to easy here.]

(;W[jm]LB[mo:A]C[[jasons\] this move misreads the direction of play. the line of white stones does no good. A play at 'A' would have given white a really nice boxed shaped moyo on the right.]
;B[kp]LB[ko:A]C[[jasons\] good move by black. At this point it's too late for white to give up the bottom and answer at 'A'. Blacks territory would be too large. If had wanted to give up the bottom he should have played differently after black played the stone at H3. So white is forced to connect.]
;W[jp];B[mm]LB[mo:A][mn:B]TR[kp]C[[jasons\] bold on blacks part, but decisive. If black doesn't play in this area white will play at 'A' or 'B' and have a large moyo. This combination of the triangled stone and N7 shows excellent tactical judgement.]
;W[mo]C[[jasons\] white wisely choses a fight.];B[no]TR[mm]
LB[nn:A][mn:B][nm:C]C[[jasons\] This  is the most critical move in the game. It set of the whole middle battle that shouldn't have ever happen. Might made what seems like a minor tactical booboo, but it cost him the game. When ever you want to cut two stones (in this case it is white who is cuttnig the Black stone at O5, and the triangled stone, you can either hane immediately as white did at 'A' or play at White 'B', Black 'A', and then white can hane at 'C'. The proper sequence is determined by the surrounding context. In this case by making the hane immediately at 'A' white allowed black to build too much strength.]

(;W[nn];B[mn]TR[mm]C[[jasons\] See? now black's stones are stronger than whites. This is why WO6 was the wrong play. From here on out white is on the weaker end of the battle.]

(;W[lo];B[ko];W[kn];B[on]LB[np:A][nm:B]C[[jasons\] white's next move at 'A' is catastrophic. It loses the game. A play at 'B' instead and black is cut off.]

(;W[np];B[nm]C[[jasons\] this just gives black eye making chances in the middle of what was a beautiful moyo.]
;W[op];B[mp];W[mq];B[pm];W[qm];B[mr];W[lq];B[ln];W[lp];B[km]
;W[kq]LB[kl:A]C[[jasons\] black is playing a bit heavy here, but it was a successful series of forcing moves. He is almost out, and almost alive. A move at 'A' now would secure either life or escape. The problem is that black is weak on the bottom as well. But I don't think he is too weak.]

(;B[nr]C[[jasons\] This move gives white too much of a chance to continue the attack.]
;W[kl];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[qk];W[pj];B[rn];W[rk];B[nk]
;W[ol];B[om];W[oo]C[[jasons\] good tactical play by white. He isn't letting black push him around with idle threats.]
;B[ro];W[mp];B[kk];W[ll];B[nj];W[ml];B[nl]
(;W[jk]LB[lj:A]C[[jasons\] I think that the splitting move at 'A' would have worked better.]
;B[kj]C[[jasons\] See? This just allows black to build strength.]
;W[jj];B[mh];W[ki];B[li];W[lj];B[kh];W[lk];B[ni]C[[jasons\] good tactical play on blacks part. He has a nice hanging connection started to the outside. It will either mean his escape or eye-space.]
;W[ng]C[[jasons\] It's hard to say whether this move is right or wrong. White is thin at the top, but black's hanging connection means that the real danger is black getting away to the left.]

(;B[lf]LB[kf:A]C[[jasons\] This contact play starts a series of moves by black that seem overconfident. I would have played the loose move at 'A' to insure escape first.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[mg];B[lg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[jh]LB[gg:A]
C[[jasons\] I think at this point the battle is over. Black can do whatever he wishes and either live, or escape. White's tenacious play here doens't do much. Black can simply answer at 'A' and insure his escape.]
;B[ih];W[ji];B[ke]C[[jasons\] This move seems like overconfidence on black's part on a misread.]
;W[fg];B[me];W[ld];B[nh]LB[mj:A]C[[jasons\] Realizing it or not, this move gave black his second eye. This sente move meant that black always had 'A' as a backup to secure life in the middle.]
;W[og];B[hf];W[gg]C[[jasons\] at this point white doens't seem to realize that the battle in the middle is over. And so the rest of the game is ruined because white is trying to kill a living group.]
