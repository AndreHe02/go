C[I think my biggest problems in the game were a botched corner defense in the upper left and an inability to find moves which really pressured black.

[magic\]:  Hi Josh.  I hope my comments are useful. Feel free to get in touch if you have questions.
Summary at the end.

magic - pahle@iway.fr];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[nq]LB[pj:a]
[ec:b][ed:c]C[[magic\]:  This is slow by black.
Playing two hoshi points normally means that he wants to settle for a moyo-building opening. Playing this move is inconsistent with that, as it aims only at territory (and doesn't even do that very well)
Normal continuation would be 'a', or an approach at 'b' or 'c'.
Like this, black gives white the chance to control the opening.]
;W[nc]C[[magic\]:  This is OK, although normally a shimari in the upper left is what's expected after you've played a 3-4 stone there.]
;B[qf]C[[magic\]:  Very slow.];W[kc]LB[kd:a]C[[magic\]:  Or 'a'. The stone in the upper left corner is high, so you can normally play high here as well.]
;B[oc]C[[magic\]:  This is not very useful for black. If he wanted to play this, he should have played it instead of '7'. It does make white overvconcentrated, though, but so is black.]
;W[ne]LB[nd:a]C[[magic\]:  Better at 'a'];B[fq];W[dn]C[[magic\]:  OK]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[fo]C[[magic\]:  Black seems to have changed his mind again and tries to build a moyo in the bottom half of the board.]
;W[jp]LB[ed:a]C[I don't know about this move.  The usual move at 14 is around where I played 15 so I thought I'd better try to do something to make sure I didn't lose too much ground.  I think the position I got out of it was okay, but that group didn't fare too well in the end.

[magic\]:  It is probably too early to play this right now. You have no stones around which can support this. If he attacks you will either be on the run with a weak group, or living small while he builds strength on the outside.  If you want to reduce his framework, there is more space on the right edge, and you have a friendly group closer by. For that matter, both hoshi corners are still open for a successful invasion (although it's too early for that).
Personally, I would think of playing at 'a', giving him the headache of dealing with your left side.]
;B[iq]LB[jq:a][ip:b][io:c][hq:d]C[[magic\]:  This move is too close. If you play 'a' and he 'b', you can hane at the head of his stones at 'c'.
'd' would have been better for him.];W[jq];B[hq]LB[ho:a]C[[magic\]:  He is now letting himself be shut in. White  playing at 'a' now could lead to trouble for black. While he runs out, you can take profit on the left.]
;W[fm]C[[magic\]:  A bit overambitious. You are pushing him towards your weak group in the bottom. This stone is not strong enough w.r.t the left side to make that edge more secure.]
;B[hn];W[jn]C[[magic\]:  Now it's you who's forced to defend your group.]
;B[kr]C[[magic\]:  Again a nudge too close, but the idea is good: take away white's base along the side.]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[np];B[op];W[no];B[pj]LB[lo:a]C[[magic\]:  White was lucky to end up as strong as he is, but even so, it has cost him.
The vital point of this shape is at 'a'. If black wanted a fight, playing at 'a' would leave white eyeless and on the run.]
;W[pn]LB[il:a][jl:b][lo:c]C[31 seems kind of weak to me.  It seems to me to not really attack black, although if black had played it it would have started to wall off a pretty big area.  But it didn't really threaten anything and invited and extension from 30.

[magic\]: (You mean 32 and 31?)
White 32 doesn't really do much. At best, it seperates two black groups which are strong anyway.  W.r.t. the weak white group, 32 doesn't really guarantee any eyes either. In fact, black can strengthen himself around here while attacking this stone.
If you are worried about the white group, then 'a' or 'b' is the right direction of play. Playing on the vital spot at 'c' would be a good idea locally, probably guaranteeing you two eyes.

Globally, I still fancy completing the shimari in the upper left.]
;B[qm]LB[qn:a][ql:b]C[[magic\]:  Again, this is too close. If white 'a', then black has to respond, so he will loose sente.
'b' does just as good a job of stopping white's base on the side]
;W[il]C[[magic\]:  Good.];B[bf]C[I found this whole corner sequence very strange, and it certainly didn't work out too well for me.

[magic\]:  I don't think I've ever seen this approach played like this - it's too low. There are lots of variations here where black comes out really bad. (See vars.)]

(;W[cf]C[[magic\]:
Go proverb: Never lean against a weak stone.  
The weak stone will extend and grow strong, and you are left with a problem.

Related proverb: Use non-contact moves to attack.];B[be]LB[cg:a]
C[[magic\]:  Black should play 'a' first, or black will be walled in.]
;W[ce]LB[bd:a][cg:b]C[[magic\]:  Probably better at 'a', or even 'b'.]
;B[ch];W[cj]C[[magic\]:  You've got to be reasonable here.
Once he's got a certain strength, you cannot expect to keep a huge corner, all of the side, and then attack his group strongly.
White 40 has made for a very nice chunk in the lower left. A bit more pressure on his group and white can also take a large upper side. All in all not too bad. Don't press to hard. Don't touch his stones !!]
;B[eh];W[dg]LB[ef:a][ej:b]C[[magic\]:  Pointless. You cannot cut this apart.
Better at 'a' or 'b', 'a' being the biggest.];B[ci];W[dj];B[ei]
;W[eg]LB[ff:a][ec:b][ed:c]C[[magic\]:  No point in touching his stones here. Better at 'a' if you want to expand. However, be careful, the corner is still open. (at 'b' or even 'c')]
;B[ec]C[[magic\]:  Ah :-)
He should have the right to live there. It'll be awkward to kill him.]
;W[dc];B[hb]LB[hd:a]C[[magic\]:  This is very low. White at 'a' would limit him, maybe even make life difficult.]
;W[hd]C[[magic\]:  :-)  Good.];B[gd]LB[hc:a][he:b][gc:c]C[[magic\]:  Hmm. Agressive. I think you could have cut this apart. (See var.) The thing _not_ to do is to play 'a', as you will find yourself strengthening his connection, whilst your own stones loose liberties, since you 'bump into' his stone at H18.

Based on your strength around, 'b' might be the easiest play. This give him the option to live small while you grow strong around, or to fight his way out in unfriendly territory.
See variations]

C[[magic\]:  Black is connected now.

Unless white can do something spectacular, the game is over now.]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[ge];B[gf];W[fe];B[ee]C[[magic\]:  This black play is a tesuji you may want to remember.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec];B[cg];W[bd];B[df];W[de];B[ff]
;W[ef];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae]C[Without this mistake by black, this corner would have really been a disaster

[magic\]:  Yes, a ten point present.];W[bg];B[bh];W[af];B[dh]
C[[magic\]:  Difficult to say whether white should respond here. The 6 points are not important, but without these stones, black really had no eye for his bulky group, so maybe white could have achieved something by trying to chase it. However, if white had responded, black would have had sente.]
;W[fj];B[df];W[fh]LB[gi:a]N[oops]C[oops

[magic\]:  Was this a mis-click?  The vital spot here would be at 'a'.
However, like I said, black is very alive now, and white has several cutting points in his lines around to worry about.]
;B[hh];W[ig];B[fi];W[ob]C[[magic\]:
This is small play and looses you sente.
There are bigger plays on the board.];B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[na]

[ql:c][pl:d][pm:e]C[This move was, I think, pretty weak.  I wanted to ues this group to push on one of the black groups, but this wasn't the way to do it, as it just invites black to strengthen the corner without gaining me anything.

Maybe something like Q7 or Q8?

[magic\]:  It's too late to be timid now!
White must look for trouble.  White 'a', black 'b' etc. could have been fun.
Q7/8 exchanges edge territory against center influence. It is difficult to make territory in the centre.]
;B[qn];W[po];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[pl]LB[qk:a]C[[magic\]:  'a'!]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[oj]LB[sl:a][qj:b][pm:c][rn:d]N[I]C[[magic\]:

You're leaving too many cutting points behind here.  Do you know of the 'monkey jump'? When white is one line lower than black (i.e. S5), he can 'jump' to  'a'. With the cutting point of black at 'b', that could been interesting. (Not to be played yet, though, there are bigger points.)
However, the threat of this means that black should probably answer 'c' at 'd', and now white can play P10 without leaving any weaknesses behind.]
;B[pm]C[I guess I overplayed a bit here and left this opening, which really hurt me.

[magic\]:  That's not quite the way to put it. Whites moves just strengthened black, which is why he can now go on the hunt. Playing stronger moves to begin with (like the invasion at 'a' earlier) would have avoided this.
With the cutting points white has, this cannot end very well for white.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[ok];B[on];W[nn]LB[nm:a]C[[magic\]:  better at 'a'. The four stones at Q5 serve no purpose any more.]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[om];W[oo];B[mm];W[ln];B[nk]C[Should I have abandoned the Q9 group?

[magic\]:  At this point in time, there's no reason to do so.]

C[I thought it was time to try to hurt this weak group, but again my attack was weak.

[magic\]:  This move doesn't attack him. He's already closed in in the direction you push him from.

To attack a group like this, you must first cut him off, then reduce his eyespace or play a placement inside it.

He can connect to his lower right at 'a', so white playing at 'a' would have been a stronger attack. However, I cannot see a way to really make him sweat.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[fl];B[gk];W[ho];B[gn];W[gp];B[fp];W[fn]
;B[go];W[hp];B[gm];W[in]C[I should not have let this group get cut off, as it had to fight for its life

[magic\]: You should have ample eyspace. See variation on next move for sequence which gives you more.]

;W[io];B[jr];W[ko];B[dk]C[And this pretty much finished it.]
;W[el];B[ck];W[bj];B[bk]LB[ah:a][ai:b][bi:c]C[[magic\]:  'a' would have started a ko for the life of this group. (black 'b', white 'c') White has lots of large kofights around the lower black group, (which has 2 liberties to much to be outright killable.)


Summary:
Interesting game with a reaonable amount of fighting.

Up to blacks approach in the upper left, the game was reasonably even, although already then, black had the advantage due to whites weak group on the lower side.
If white had managed to build up his own strength whilst dealing with the black group in the upper left, the game would have become a lot more close.
It looks like Black is quite experienced when it somes to fighting. Although some of the attacks/cuts he makes are overplay, he did manage to use this skill quite a lot.
Suggestions for white:  The opening was OK, although the invasion at the bottom was a typical 'jealousy' play which normally isn't very good. The aim is not to make your opponents territory smaller than yours, but to make yours bigger than his :-)  Completing the upper left shimari would have changed the game quite drastically.
If you can get your hands on it, have a look through the 'Get Strong at Go' series 'Tesuji' book. It has lots of goodies when it comes to capturing cutting stones, connecting your own stones etc.
And always try to look at the complete goban - play the global moves before the local moves.

I hope this has been useful. If you have any questions, please drop me a line.]

He now has to make two eyes at the bottom.

If black plays at 'a', it turns into a difficult life and death problem which I annot see with 100% certainty, but I think it would become a seki.  However, if black connects at 'b', white can give him a dead eyeshape. (See continuation)]
