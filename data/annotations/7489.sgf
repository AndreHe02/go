C[Hello, dear reviewer! Thank you in advance for taking your time to review this game.

In this game I played B and lost it by 1,5 pts.
I've added some questions, but will be gratefull for any advices about my play.

/Igor' (Felisratus on KGS)

P.S.: I'm not native speaker, so sory in advance for my bad english.

Hello Igor,

this is Amygdala and I have already had the pleasure to review one of your games in the past. I will introduce my comments with "A:". I am not a native English speaker myself, so never mind.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[A:
The high Chinese opening was cultivated by the late Fujisawa Shuko and is only rarely played nowadays. For us amateurs, who are free to try out things that do not meet professional common sense, it might be a nice way to commemorate this genius and giant of go, who just recently has passed away.]
;W[nc];B[pf]LB[lc:A]C[A:
Possible and the choice of most professionals; feels, however, a little sluggish. The aim of the Chinese fuseki is to use your framework by attacking white, so A shows the better spirit and is more in accordance with the main theme.]
;W[pb];B[fq]C[Felisratus: Is tenuki ok here?

A:
Quite fine and well possible.];W[qc];B[qd]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[A:
This is much too timid and docile. Playing A before translates as: "I do not bother if you will take my corner!". Answering here now is not in accordance with that boldness. You DO have to attack at B instead now!]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qo]C[Felisratus: I've heared, that low approach isn't good for W in the chinese fuseki. Did I answered it well?

A:
Yes, you are right. You did.];B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[pl];B[qk]
;W[ql]
(;B[rm]C[A:
I feel that this might be a little too early. The variation is probably good enough. The weak group will be a constant burden for white.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[sk];B[sj];W[sl];B[ri];W[ro];B[rp];W[nl];B[ok]
;W[ol];B[me]C[Felisratus: This result seems to me to be favorable for B. Am I right?

A:
Yes, I think that you are right.];W[ld];B[dr];W[cq];B[cf];W[ci]
;B[fd];W[ee];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ic];B[de];W[ed];B[fo];W[ff]
LB[kf:A]C[Felisratus: W's moyo on the upper side isn't so big. Is it urgent to reduce it right now? If not, what are the better options for B?

A:
I think it is the right time for a reduction now. I would prefer a more careful move such as A.]

(;B[ie];W[he]LB[kf:A]C[A:
You are lucky that white answers so slack. If white had played at A, he could have attacked your invading stone while reducing your moyo to the right.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[jd];W[je]
(;B[if]C[Felisratus: I misread here. Seems like l15 was the right move.

A:
Yes, l15 if anything...];W[ke];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[fc];B[ec];W[fe];B[db];W[fc]TR[hp][lp]C[Felisratus: My invasion failed, but  I thought, that the game is still playable. So it looks like the invasion wasn't so urgent.

A:
Interesting reasoning, but now your result is much worse than it could have been. I would definitely prefer to play white now, as he still has options at the triangled points. Invading at one of them, he will have to face a double attack, but the white group to the right ist stronger than it seems.]

Well done, the more urgent one fixed!];W[ki];B[mh];W[kg];B[dj]

C[Felisratus: I lost quite alot here. Looks like my defence wasn't well enogh.

A:
A horrible result for black!];B[ms]C[Felisratus: From this move the endgame starts. It's my weak part of the game, so I'll be gratefull for any comments about my mistakes.

Any general suggestions about my Go?

A:
You have improved considerably since I last reviewed one of your games! You generally played quite fine. Unnecessarily calm moves like 7 and 11 might impede your progress a little. A crucial point was the failed invasion in the North: 49 was in fact to deep, and 51 was the wrong continuation. 109 resulted in desaster: when you can cut, cut! This will add spice to your game. Always try to keep sente in the endgame.]
