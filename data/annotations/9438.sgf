C[Reviewed 02jun2014 for Black by Allan Wickberg (lobo2me@DGS, 10k)

I'm black in this game. It's an even game between two 16k+ on IGS. The result is a win by resignation for me, because the opponent disconnected, even though he was up by 4 points. I still had some aji in the top right, but I think that with correct play he should have been able to fend it off. I'm not to happy about winning like this, so I would like to know where I went wrong. Thanks in advance!]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[eq];W[qn];B[np];W[lq];B[lp]C[al> I don't like this move; it kind of aims at building influence towards the middle, but the white stone at R6 makes this less feasible. Also, black forces white to live at the bottom, so black does not get any points there, either. N3 would be my alternative, then settle a big corner with R4 or R3.]
;W[mq];B[mp];W[oq];B[nq];W[oo];B[op];W[kq];B[jp]C[al> This move does not accomplish much, especially since white now has another stone above the wall. Other choices would be R3 or H3.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[nr];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko]
(;B[cf]C[al> I think black leaves the bottom right situation a bit too early. The ladder is avoided (B K5) but iIf white plays S4 then black would end up with considerably less corner points.

al> Another option is to eliminate eye space for the bottom white group and chase it out towards the center, potentially creating points to the left (back up to previous move to see variation)]
;W[ce];B[df]C[al> When white pushes like this without having a stone on the other side (below) the black stone, it would be more logical to me for black to try to punish white by playing F16 or F17 instead.]
;W[fd]C[al> Now white intends to grab a big corner - not secured yet, but black does not get as much out of the exchange.]
;B[cj]C[al> As became obvious, this was one step too far - B C11 would have made a big difference.]
;W[ch];B[dh]C[al> Pushing the white stone towards the black mini wall would be better. Contact play is for survival, not for attack, since often both get stronger from it. B D11 is what I would have tried.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[cg]
(;B[dg]C[al> Black should not let white connect (see variations)]
;W[bf];B[bi];W[bg];B[ek];W[ck]C[I wasn't really sure what to do, and the subsequent moves show him taking some points here.]

(;B[dk]C[al> Black should play B10 here to stop white from infesting the rest of the left side.]
;W[bj];B[dj];W[bk];B[cm];W[bm];B[bn];W[cn];B[dn]C[al> Why not at B8?]
;W[bo];B[co];W[an];B[cn];W[bl];B[bp];W[fq];B[fp];W[io]
(;B[jn]C[al> I believe black should exploit the gap that white just provided (see variations)]
;W[ip]MA[el][em][en][fl][fm][fn][gl][gm][gn][hl][hm][hn][il]
[im][in][do][eo][fo][go][ho][io]C[al> Now white is solid and on the inside of what could have been black's moyo (X's)]
;B[in];W[go];B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[fo];B[eo];W[kn];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[im];W[km];B[nd]C[al> Black leaves one move to early again; K8 would leave the potential for making territory from the walls but now white can still get in.]
;W[od]C[Again a move that freaked me out a little, after wards I looked it up and its a personal Kitani joseki. And I'm not to happy about my response.]
;B[kd]C[al> I am not familiar with that joseki, but would probably have played something like O17 instead to prevent white from playing there.]
;W[id];B[qe]C[al> I feel that R15 neither goes for the corner nor for the right side. It ends up against the wall and becomes a pivot for white. R17 would snatch the corner, and R14 would be to shoot for the side.]
;W[qd];B[of]C[al> Black could strengthen the resistance to white by playing R14 instead.]
;W[qf];B[pe]C[al> The upper side is not settled yet, and the right side is still wide open. Grabbing decisive territory in the center is mostly not feasible at all.

By now it's fairly obvious where I'm going to have to make territory. I don't mind making center territory, but in this case, it doesn't go all that well. Could I have improve anything? Or taking territory somewhere else?]
;W[re];B[ph]C[al> Black is offering the right side to white now by playing this far into the board. There is no way to compensate for that in the middle since white peeks into black's potential moyo from above. It feels like R12 would have been a better move for black here. Maybe even R11 - note that white's bottom group still has no eye space settled.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[pf];B[oe];W[qg];B[pj]C[al> I don't think the cut is too serious (see crude variation at #95). It feels more important to get some points along the side, and put pressure on white's group at the bottom.

Should have protected the cut at P13 instead, or; did I blow the killing of the cutting stone, that's about to happen?]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[nb];B[md];W[og]
(;B[ng];W[oh];B[pi];W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[jj]C[al> K10 at K8 and there would be a chance of chasing the white O12 group and maybe win points both along the right side and in the center.]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[kf];B[lf]C[al> That shape does not feel right. Better just play L13.]
;W[ke];B[kg];W[le];B[me];W[jg];B[kh];W[lj];B[ml]C[al> I don't think this is bad. It cuts off white's escape. The mistake comes in the move after the next.

Looking at the end result, this was definitely a mistake.];W[nk]
;B[nl]C[al> As I have mentioned earlier, contact play is usually not good if you want to capture. I would have played P8 instead, to connect to the Q10 group.]

;W[mi];B[kj];W[ni];B[hg];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[gk];B[ro]
;W[rn];B[qo];W[fm]C[al> I believe there is still hope - see variations.

Now I'm really in trouble. Is there still a way to save them or should I have protected earlier on?]

TR[rd]C[al> I don't see that the top right corner could be invaded, really. White surrounds it well.

There are several possibilities to do some damage at S16, but I also think that given correct play, he'll save everything. What are your thoughts?
Thank you very much for reviewing my game.])
