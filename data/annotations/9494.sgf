FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd]C[Greeting, thanks for your review!

I played black in this game. I have a couple specific questions in the comments, and am also interested in timing in general -- a few times white played in an area the turn just before I intended to, and I felt like I was behind most of the game.


Hi Michael,

I'm glad to review your game today. 
And I hope it didn't take too long!
I think the main issue for you is shape. I will try to help you there in this review. 
Secondly with some advice you can improve your general view in the game - the "whole board view", to make better strategic decisions.
Last but not least there is the pure tactics. But there isn't much to say about it. Let me just give you the established advice: do a lot of tsumegos and practice the deep thinking.

I hope you enjoy my review with benefit!

;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[jp];B[fd];W[df]
(;B[ec]C[Not a good move. It provokes d17...]
(;W[dc]LB[ec:A][jc:C][id:B]C[...which gives white the corner. The black shape is quite useless. 
The stone at A would be more effecitve if it was an extension - at B or C for instance.
I'll give you another example for such a play in the variation.]
;B[kd];W[hd]C[Slightly overplay.]
(;B[ff];W[md];B[ic]LB[ic:A][je:B]C[Is this reasonable?

H: 
white strews stones in your position and hopes to succeed in the following fight. How to answer? Let's stick to the basics: seperate the opponent and keep your own stones connected.
L16 is seperating white quite well. But what about A? It provokes H17 which makes white stronger and seperates black.

On the other hand it's a severe attack on H16 - after W-h17, white has no base. Again: the tactic of making stone(s) heavy and then hunt it.

Well I didn't know how to rate A so I asked a dan-player. He asked me "what does the keima can what the kosumi can't?" - A is good but the better (best?) play is B.]
;W[hc]
(;B[nc]LB[jc:A][id:B]TR[hf][hg][fh]C[The left upper side is still more important than the right! And strengthen n16 can't be good since you get jammed on two places.

To keep white under pressure it is necessary to reforce J17. With A or B.
See var. for a possible outcome.

OR you sacrifice J17 and play];W[mc];B[lc]TR[mc][nc]C[You have to be more carefully with contact play! This provokes the cut of your stones. The shape you create is that of a cut one-point jump. You don't want it to be cut!]
;W[mb];B[nb]C[It's not the time to safe points in the corner. when white goes on second line you don't have to follow. Better reinforce the central group - it seperates and threats both white's "sticks". Or reinforce the left group. Its quite difficult to find the right move. But I suggest: do not try to catch both groups and treat your middle group lightly, don't hold on every single stone of it. 

Also I think n18/o18 are both the wrong direction of play. right direction goes towards center here.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[nd];B[od]LB[pb:A][pc:B]C[Since white has that awkward shape-killer at A it would be better for you to play there your own, or at B which looks more solid to me.]
;W[pb];B[oc];W[nf];B[of]LB[kf:B][pg:A]C[Lets have a look on the score from time to time.
In my opinion black is ahead (taking into account the situations of the groups more than any points)

But the game could be decided on the upper side where both have two seperated not-alive-groups.
Overmore the right corner could easily get at risk too.

Unfortunately you play a conact move again, instead of for example A.
But the problem is that O14 is a forcing move and white will be the first to play in the upper center again. This is due to P16 which produced the bad shape. Or can you ignore o14 and play B(?) and still live in the corner??]

(;W[og]
(;B[pg];W[ng];B[ph]C[Locally good. White has the upper hand now in the center but you made 30 points on the right side (though it seems there's still a bit aji in the corner). White has about 15 points on the left. I think white is slightely ahead.]
;W[hf]
(;B[ck]LB[fh:A]C[At this point I was worried about my two groups (F16 M16), but thought claiming this side was more important.

H:
The worries were right the idea of claiming anything new was wrong. Urgent moves before big moves! 


And overmore the move influences the urgent situation in a bad way...]
;W[di]C[...since white can now attack c9];B[cn];W[cp];B[eg]
;W[dg];B[kf]LB[dg:C][eg:A][fi:B]C[Trying to escape... In general this was very different from most games I have played lately, with several long skinny groups barely alive for the majority of the game.

H:
the peep at A is used to make the 2-point jump on B possible. The exchange A - C alone is good for white.]
;W[hg];B[lh]LB[kh:A]C[It is said the kakari is good for attack and bad for defense (cause it can be cut). 
But as for the attack its inefficient. Your net has a big hole and you force white through this hole (o11)

I prefer simply A. Mind that you still have two weak groups to hunt.]
;W[ni];B[mh]C[Again a bad forcing move. Think about what a move provokes the opponent to do and if the exchange is good for you or him/her.]
;W[oi];B[ii];W[hi];B[hj]LB[fi:A]C[In hindsight it wasn't smart to push white toward cutting off my weak group,

H:
But wouldn't you give away that weak group happily if you got the L14 group in exchange?
Unfortunately this group has become a very slippery fish.

After J11 and the contact play h11 hane or stretch is consequent. But sure the 4 stones are as good as dead.]
;W[gi];B[fi]LB[eh:B][fh:A][gh:C]C[quite interesting move. if white tries to cut at A, after black B or C a complex fight breaks out.]
;W[gj]C[Instead of the cut white deciedes for the probably better to just go through for white. this triangle is strong while the three surronding stones are poorly atached.]
;B[ej];W[fh];B[eh]C[good move!];W[ei];B[fj]
(;W[gh];B[dh]TR[ej]C[Because of e10 the cut by white isn't working anymore. Come back for black!]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[dk]
(;B[ek]LB[ek:A]C[oops.];W[dj];B[el];W[dl];B[dm];W[cl]C[For a kill first confine your opponent and make his living space small from the outside. Then play the vital point. Sometimes you can/must play a vital point before the confining but here that doesn't work actually.]
;B[bk]
(;W[bl];B[cm]LB[bm:B][em:A][bn:C]C[better repair your shape first and connect.
The cut at A is to severe.];W[em];B[fm];W[en];B[gl];W[gk];B[fl]
;W[hk];B[bm]C[I think I can still kill this group.

H:
No way. You die first.];W[al];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah]
(;W[hl]LB[dd:A][hd:B][kd:C][nd:D]C[Big mistake.
Suddenly black is far ahead. 
There are 4 running groups (group B with the fewest problems) and only one of them is yours.

Please count the score and think about the possible happenings and evaluate which is the righ strategy to bore the palm.]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[bj]
(;W[ak];B[am];W[cj];B[bk];W[fo];B[ck]C[I don't think I needed to move here yet, miscalculated.

H:
Indeed. F5 hasn't been a threat so white has give his Sente away, but you gave it back ^^]
;W[bf]C[I had wanted to move at D15 last turn, but now opportunity is gone.

H:
D15 would be a really odd way to start the attack.];B[lp]C[Good move.
its a bit far from m12 but you definetely are on the winning path.]
;W[hn]C[too small];B[qq]LB[lk:A][nl:B]C[a bit out of focus. 
much better would be A or B or so.];W[qn]TR[lb][mb][mc][md]
[nd][nf][ng][og][ni][oi]C[I always feel like I should be able to defend against attacks like this, but am not sure how to do it.

H:
don't let yourself been tricked. At most this is the preparation for an attack (on the corner)
Why not attack yourself? Just play between the two marked groups and you attack all of that stones at once. Overmore m12 needs support. 
You see whats the direction of play here? 
Don't worry about your corner or the few points on the right side.]
;B[pm]C[and so this is really a good move!];W[qm];B[ql]LB[pl:A]
C[Just you don't need to catch these stones. Just be thankful for the strength you got ON THE OUTSIDE, by white's pointless invasion and play A.
And by the way, the solidness of A make it much more difficult for white to use r6 and r7 too than the hane.]
;W[pn];B[om];W[on];B[no]C[again, wrong direction of play
as well as an ambigious move.];W[nn];B[nm]LB[nm:A][mn:B]C[you push the group out as toothpaste out of the package.
(A for B is a good exchange for white)];W[ok];B[pk];W[mm];B[ml]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[ol];B[pl];W[oj];B[mn];W[lm];B[mk];W[kj];B[lj]
C[Yeah! you have the group enclosed.];W[qi];B[pi];W[pj];B[ri]
;W[pf]
(;B[oe];W[qf];B[qh]LB[rf:A]C[not necessary. You could catch them at A without a problem.]

;W[rn];B[sl];W[kg];B[lg];W[pc]
(;B[sd]LB[sd:A]C[Total disaster. For some reason I thought R18 wasn't safe.]
;W[rb]LB[sj:A][oo:B][rp:C]C[After that mistake, is there anyway to live now?

H:
I see no way. You should fight for your remaining two groups now. Chances are after you bring life to the center group you still catch Q6 group.
(R9 lives by A or through attack on B or maybe C)]
(;B[re]LB[re:A]C[H: 
not good to play it out. You just get caught there.];W[qe];B[sb]

You have fought very successfully and now you're about 10-15 points ahead. But as long as you don't lose in the corner e18 is a good move.

Oh and you can cut at B with good chances to kill g11 group!]

H:
I'm quite surprised about the endscore^^
It was a changeful and exciting game and you were ahead many times. 
As I mentioned before, you tend to contact play and forcing moves which turn our disadvantageous for you. Here is much room for improvement.
