C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. My weakness has always been score estimation (i.e. I never know if i'm winning or losing unless its a margin of about 20 points) and yose (I play mainly by feel, not by calculating numbers). Even though I was leading at the start and especially in the middle, I lost the lead and ended up losing by 2.5 points. There are a few specific problems in the game, but please also leave some general comments on my overall gameplay (my fuseki, battle techniques, reduction techniques, expansion techniques, end-game etc). Thanks once again!

[hs][ss][rf][as]C[My main questions for this game are the white Q15 invasion/reduction, the white probe at B16,  and the black fuseki at the R12 area. I feel that I messed up those 3 critical areas. Although I was leading in the end, and lost because of my yose, I was planning for that, as I know that my yose is pretty bad. What I didn't plan for, however, is for white to catch up with my 30 point lead so easily. The lead was lost during the Q15 and B16 moves. Also, on hindsight, I feel that my fuseki at the R12 area is quite bad, as I can spot a few weaknesses that white didn't really exploit in the game.

Thank you once again for reviewing my game!
