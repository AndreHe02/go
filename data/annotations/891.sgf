;B[nd];W[rd]LB[pj:A][qi:B]C[sita: I think you should play 'A'. 'B' is the logical follow up of your move, but then you end up with too many low (that is 3rd row) stones. You should try to play a balanced joseki and end up with a more or less equal distribution of low and high stones.]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[fq];W[cn]LB[dn:A][cf:B][hq:C]C[sita: At this point it is definitley wrong to play another low stones. You should play at least at 'A'. But since 'B' is low the left side is not so interesting. I would prefer to play at 'C' or somewhere around.]
;B[jp];W[dj]LB[cn:A][cf:B][qn:C][qi:D][nq:E]C[sita: Again, with 'A' and 'B' there are two low stones at the left side, so it is not interesting. The actual played move seems to be big, but b cannot make territory there anyway (as opposed to the right side e.g., where you both can make territory). And if he invades there now, your has a weak group, and that is a good think to have for you.

On the other hand, you have everywhere low stones now, so it is not easy to find a good move.

I would suggest 'C' or, since 'D' is low, perhaps even 'E'. But it is difficult and the game is allready in favour of b, IMO.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[fo]C[roe: I'm not so pleased with the opening. Even though black has some weaknesses aroun the Q4 stone and around M17, black has much more influence than white..

sita: Yes, that is the price of playing low. I insist a bit on that point, but I think it was your worst and fundamental mistake in this opening.]
;W[nq]C[roe: I don't know if R6 had been better, but I wanted to reduse the influence if the thickness at F3-F5

I don't know, too. :) It looks playable.];B[lq]LB[qq:A][pq:B]
C[roe: Normally I would play R3 or R6, think that one of those would have been better in this situation.

sita: Yes, if you play 'A', his only chance is to answer at 'B', but then he would be hopeless overconcentrated at the left side.]
;W[no];B[qn]C[sita: b is still a bit overconcentrated, but you see that it is also a good thickness to attack your stones.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[nm];B[qk];W[pl]LB[rj:A][nk:B][lm:C]C[sita: save such forcing moves for the time when they are really needed. Now it is just aji-keshi. You never know, if you want to play, e.g. 'A' sometimes in sente.

If you want to help your group on the run (and that is a good idea) than play 'B' or 'C'. These moves probably look simple, but even simple moves are sometimes (or often) correct.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[pm];W[om]LB[nk:A]C[sita: The shape move in this situation seems to be 'A'.]
;B[pj]C[sita: And b directly punishes your mistake and exploits your weakness.]
;W[qj]TR[pk][pl][om][nm][no][nq][pr][pj]LB[oj:A][nd:B][pd:C]
C[sita: I think your marked group is too weak for the cut. It seems that his marked b stones is weaker, but there is a sente move at 'A' and some near back-up stones with 'B' and 'C'. And, as you see in the future, your stones come quite soon under attack.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[nj];W[oh]TR[nj][oj][pj][pk][pl][nk][om][nm][no]
[nq][pr]LB[mk:A]C[roe: I couldn't allow W-N9 B-P13

sita: It depends a bit and who is attacking whom. If you think your marked w group is attacking the marked b group, then you would be right. But it is the other way around, w seems much weaker and b should not have a problem with his stones. So your actual move does nothing more but reducing blacks influence in the upper side of the center a bid. But with the attack of your marked group, he gets therefore a much bigger influence in the lower part. So I indeed would suggest 'A'. But on the other hand I also agree that you are allready behind and that it will be not easy to win this game.]
;B[mk];W[ok];B[mj];W[lm]C[roe: Bad move, better at N8 I think...

sita: agree];B[ml];W[nl];B[mn]C[sita: "Don't peep where you can cut!" Big mistake of b.]
;W[mm];B[mp]TR[mn]LB[nn:A][mh:E]C[sita: Again, if b played the marked stone, he should at least cut at 'A'. He made it quite easy for you to get two eyes.]

;W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[qm];W[qr];B[rq];W[mh];B[kj];W[kh];B[jl]
;W[kl];B[jk];W[kk];B[li]C[roe: Is the fight after W-K12 B-M12 W-M13 possible for white?

sita: No, it is very bad to have another weak group now. Connecting is fine.]
;W[lh];B[ji];W[lc]LB[lh:A]C[sita: Very nice! Now you see why it is a good idea to build thickness with moves like 'A'. It would be impossible to invade at the top with a weak group fighting in the center.]
;B[rc];W[re]LB[jm:A][em:B]C[sita: I would not answer this move. The worst follow up b has, is to make a few endgame points in gote or even less in sente.

I suggest 'A', because b's center group is not very strong and you can exploit that a bit or even better 'B': Building own territory, reducing the prospects of the opponent and aiming at 'A'.]
;B[mb];W[mc]LB[nb:A][lb:B][kd:C]C[sita: If b answers with 'A', 'B' is gote, so you cannot sperate the two b groups anymore. I would suggest 'C' therefore.]
;B[nc]C[sita: You are lucky :)];W[lb];B[cb];W[bb];B[ch];W[dh]
LB[dg:A]C[sita: You are quite strong around there, so you can think about attacking stronger with 'A']
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ce]LB[di:A]C[sita: b should play 'A', these move dont make live.]
;W[de];B[bf];W[cg];B[bh];W[bj];B[bg];W[dg];B[cm];W[dm]LB[dn:A]
C[sita: Invading moves like the b one are always difficult to answer. I suggest to stay strong and play a move like 'A'. You cannot avoid an escape of some stones anyway. But if you stay strong, you have a very nice attack against the whole b center.]
;B[ck];W[cj]C[sita: At least now b is definitley dead at the upper part of the left side.]
;B[bn];W[bm]LB[co:A]C[sita: How about 'A'? Stay connected and strong, you cannot have everything...]

(;W[cl]C[roe: Bad move, think E4 had worked.

sita: I am not sure what you call "worked". I have some suggestions in the variation to the previous move. I agree that this move is bad.]
;B[ep];W[en];B[bq]TR[dp][cp][cq]C[sita: Now your marked stones are captured. It will be hard, if not impossible to win the game now.]

;W[hh];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[if];B[ii]
(;W[gi]LB[gf:A][ff:B]C[sita: 'A' is better. B cannot make eyes between your actual played move an 'A' anyway, but this move is important for your own group. If you fear b 'B', look at the variation.]

C[roe: Bad move, bad reading....];B[ib];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc]
;W[id];B[he];W[gf];B[gb];W[ge];B[ha];W[ie]LB[hc:A]C[sita: You should think about killing b's eye with 'A'.]
;B[hc];W[me];B[ff]C[roe: Still think that N15was bigger than F14

sita: sure.

Let's make a rough overall count here:
w: 30 points at the left
   maximum of 25 points at the right.

That makes 55 plus some more prisoners, but definitley less than 60. Black has 60 points at the lower side alone. So probably this is a good point to resign.]

[sp][sq][sr][ss]C[sita: Some general comments:

You had a very bad start in this game. It is the only game I saw from you, bud judging from this you play too many moves at the 3rd row in your first 20 moves. You should try to balance your opening between territory and influence.

You make too many cuts and produce too many weak groups. Of course it is not nice to see your opponent making big moves. But if you have a weak group on the board, it is sometimes better to strengthen this group with a move than to take a big one. If you don't, your opponent don't take this big one, but five other big ones by chasing your weak group.

You should not try to save everyting, like e.g. in the situation in the lower left. If your opponent makes a reasonable invasion, he will get something. Than *you* should decide what to give him. If you fight for everything, he fights back and takes what *he* want.]
