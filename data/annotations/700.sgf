;B[pd]C[Hi, MK, this is Kan.

Although I did my best, please do not assume my opinion is always right or
better than yours.];W[dc];B[qo];W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[cj]

;B[fe];W[bb]N[#24]C[MK: Up to here I had no problem with my game. During
the game the position looked ok to me.];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bd]
;B[dh]SQ[cj]TR[jd]C[MK: But now my stones e14, d14
are under strong attack. So they are cutting stones, I decided not to
sacrifice them. But now the position looked quite uncomfortable to me. What
went wrong?

Kan:  Nothing went wrong.  The following battle is a difficult one, but I
do not see any disadvantage for White.  Black has a marked stone above, but
White has also a marked stone on the left.  Therefore there will be a
battle with no handicap.];W[ff];B[ge];W[fh];B[dj];W[dk]MA[df]
[ef][ff][fh]LB[ck:A]C[Kan:  I think it
should be A.  Because you must keep the strength of the marked stones, you
should avoid to induce Black's moves which would affect that strength, such
as the next Black move.];B[ej];W[ci];B[bg];W[ac];B[eh];W[hh]
LB[gi:A]TR[cf][cg][bg][dh][eh][dj][ej]MA[df][ef][ff][fh]C[Kan:  This should be A.  Please do not forget the battle
is between the marked stones.];B[gi]C[Kan:  Therefore, this is a very good move.]
;W[gh];B[hj]C[Kan:  I think Black has now a good advantage in this fight.]
;W[kg]LB[jh:A]C[Again, this should be A.  Please do not 'escape' from the
battlefield.];B[mg];W[ij];B[ik];W[ii]LB[jj:A]C[Kan: This should be A.]
;B[jk]
(;W[ki]LB[hk:A]C[Kan:  Didn't you think of A?  It is impossible to
tell the outcome. But I think it is worth thinking of it, since the actual
game is rather too good for Black.  See the variation.];B[fn]
N[#51]C[Kan:  Black is in a clear advantage now.];W[pq]MA[df]
[ef][ff][fh][gh][hh][ii][ij][ki][kg]LB[mi:A]C[MK: A third weak
group. :( But if both black moyos become territory I will lose. Any better
idea than the actual move?

Kan:  If I were you, I would move to A, because the marked stones seem too
weak without that move.]
(;B[mq]C[Kan:  If I were the Black, I would play as shown in the variation.]
;W[rp]MA[qo]LB[op:A][po:B]C[Kan:  I would move to A or B.  I think such a
move as yours is bad unless it aims to attack the marked stone.  In this
situation, this is not the case.];B[op];W[oq];B[nq]LB[np:A]
C[Kan:  This should be A, then Black is much
thicker.];W[pp];B[po];W[lj];B[qk]MA[df][ef][ff][fh][gh][hh]
[ii][ij][kg][ki][lj]LB[nj:A]N[#61]C[Kan:  This should be A.  Both you and your opponent underestimate
the weakness of marked stones.];W[ll];B[qg];W[oi];B[mk];W[lk]

;B[gf];W[if];B[ie];W[ql];B[oo];W[mm];B[og]MA[df][ef][ff][fh]
[gh][hh][if][ii][ij][ki][kg][lj][mj][lk][ll][mm]C[Kan:  I think the marked stones are still very very weak at this stage.
 In the real game, Black did not attack them, because he had a big profit
in the upper because of your mistake.  If he had attacked them, how would
you have saved them?];W[gb];B[fb];W[fa];B[oc];W[jb]C[MK: ok, that should be one to the left.]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[gc];W[hc]C[MK: I saw the ko, but I wanted to play it in a
more profitable way. Unfortunately that way it did not work. :)

Kan:  I did not see any Ko around here.];B[ga];W[nb];B[lb];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qc]C[MK: I thought that I should at least
get a ko in the corner. Is there a way?

Kan:  I do not think so.]
(;B[rd]LB[qd:A]C[Kan:  This is a bad move.  This should be A.  Please see
the variation.]

[ij][ki][if][kf][kg][lg][lj][lk][mj][ll][mm]C[MK: So I finally won.
But the game was in favor of my opponent and apart of some (minor)
obvious mistakes of mine, I do not know where he took the lead.

Kan:  The direct reason of your disadvantage was obviously your mistake in
the upper part of the board.  However, you were always in disadvantage in
this game, because you made the marked stone extremely weak all during the
game.  You should be more sensitive to the strength of stones.]
