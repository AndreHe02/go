C[Hi,thanks for reviewing my game.
I was crushed and i think i started to play bad in the joseki .
I managed to make seki in the middle game but my stones collapsed.
I would like to know what moves i missed.

Trillian: Hi Flame! I tried my best and I hope my comment will help you :).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[qm];W[pm]C[Trillian:
This move is very uncommon and I never had it in my games before  (instead I know R3, S5 or P6 lead into joseki).]
;B[pl]
(;W[qn]C[W p7 here?
so i decided to play p7

Trillian: see var.];B[om];W[pn];B[ql]C[Trillian: 
I'd have played the same until now.];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[i think it was my first mistake
p4 probably greedy.
maybe p2?

Trillian: 
Yes, I think p2. See var.];W[pp];B[nq];W[or]
(;B[nr]C[Trillian: better variation];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[rp]
;W[rr]
(;B[rn]C[Trillian: 
nice idea but it doesn't work ;-)
See variation.];W[ro];B[so];W[rq];B[qo];W[qp]C[Trillian: 
You gained almost nothing and now you cannot close your wall so perfectly as seen in the variation anymore.]
;B[cd]TR[op][nq][nr]C[Trillian: 
Good that you got the last corner but on the other hand your triangled stones became almost worthless.]
;W[ed];B[gc];W[cc]C[Trillian: 
d17 (var.) leads into one of the most common joseki.]
(;B[dd];W[dc];B[ec]
(;W[ee]C[weird move,i though b17 the best here

Trillian: yes. White should've played B16 (var.).];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[bd];W[eb];B[fc]
(;W[fb]C[Trillian:
White shouldn't push on the second line but simply live in the corner.]
;B[ab];W[gb]
(;B[hb]C[looks like a bad cut now

Trillian: Yes. You must've had extended instead.];W[hc];B[hd]
;W[ic];B[gd];W[ib]C[Trillian: 
This is a catastrophe for black.]
(;B[eg]C[Trillian: 
Wrong strategy: too agressive. Better variation.];W[ff]
(;B[hg]C[Trillian:
bad shape. Better one shorter at H14.];W[fg];B[eh];W[fh];B[ei]
;W[id];B[gf];W[fi];B[ef];W[fe];B[jg]C[wrong direction?

Trillian: 
I think it's ok. You still have a weakness in your shape but after white J14 it's ok to sacrifice I think.]

(;W[de];B[cf]
(;W[ce]C[Trillian: 
White made too many exchanges that costed liberties. Since it could be seki later that might be important.]

;B[fj];W[ek];B[gj];W[hh];B[ii]C[Trillian: 
looks nice. now the game is getting complicated, almost unpredictable. I found some interesting variations and I think there's no way to capture the white, although it looks like. So your strategy should be to build a wall by sacrificing something.]

(;W[ih];B[jh];W[hi];B[hj]
(;W[ig];B[if];W[he]C[Trillian:
Last chance to sacrifice. you can never stand the seki because of your cuts.]

(;B[ge];W[ie];B[hf];W[jf];B[gi];W[gh];B[dh];W[ij];B[ji];W[ik]
C[its looks like i couldnt prevent this =/

Trillian:
yes, this is the cranes nest, no way to escape. You should've sacrificed the upper part of your group earlier.]
;B[hk];W[hl]
(;B[je]C[Trillian:
you have only 4 liberties, so theres no chance to capture this stone... after the 4 following moves you lost most of your moyo on the right side plus you have 2 more weak groups in the center.]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[lf];B[le];W[mf];B[me];W[nf]C[Trillian:
I think now is the time to resign];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[kq];B[dn]

now atari and then cut!]

Better play like this to secure your right group. For the left one A and B is miai. You shouldn't risk everything to try to capture those two stones. It's not so important. Better keep your own groups save before attacking.]

This fits perfectly with you upper right corner-stone. Also for later there's some aji with the cut at A (that's why you don't exchange B18-B16 before). White should try to find another variation to avoid this result.]
))
(;B[nn]C[Trillian: 
This move makes your wall perfect. Although it is Gote I think you can be happy like this. White can't push through because he needs the liberties for not beeing captured with S6.]
;W[dd];B[rn];W[ro];B[so]))
(;B[np];W[pr];B[dd]C[Trillian: 
I think the black influence is superior to whites corner. Also black gets the last open corner. Good for black, maybe even better that the last variation wich results out of p2.]

(;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[qp];W[dd];B[fc]LB[ok:B][ol:A]C[Trillian: 
I think this result is very nice for black. Don't worry about the cut at A. Simply answer at B, it's a good exchange.]

Kogo's Dictionary says this to be natural but I'd continue with O4 and I can't see how this could be good for white...]
