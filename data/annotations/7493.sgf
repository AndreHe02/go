[gq:C]C[rev: small move as the upper left already is strong and needs no support now. better A, B or C]
;W[op];B[jq];W[lq]LB[gp:A][gq:B]C[Was this move ok?

rev: difficult ... it's not a real mistake; but as your corner already is strong, its not needed.

next the black stone has only weak connection to the corner and beeing passive here gives black the possibility to secure the connection to the corner.

so maybe A or even B would be better.
black cannot play both sides ... so you can attack the single stone or the weak corner]
;B[gq]C[rev: no real point to attack black now];W[kd]LB[kb:B]
[ic:A][qi:C]C[rev: this should be one below (3rd line); black at A threatens B so white has to react

btw. C should be one line up ;)];B[ko];W[lo]LB[dn:A]C[I'm not sure about this move either...

rev: NO: never touch a stone (unless you know what you are doing ;) ...

you white group is still very strong so don't play here 

next it is time to invade before everything is closed 

so A would be worth a try];B[kn];W[hc]LB[pm:B][dn:A]C[rev: too small

 again A ... even B is bigger as nothing is left to invade for black]
;B[gd];W[ln]LB[dm:A][qm:B]C[rev: does not work 

neither A or B is secure];B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[jj]LB[ih:A]C[ok.

 but i would set it arround A keeping some connection to the upper side and keeping away from the very strong black wall]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[ij];B[hk];W[lk]LB[mj:A]C[too close!

A looks better for a connection]
(;B[jg];W[he]LB[if:A]C[good ... but keeping away from the strong black stones may work better A?]
;B[mg];W[lj]LB[hg:B][mj:A][nj:C][cq:D]C[A would be better; connecting both sides ...

anyway i don't think you have to connect here as you could try to connect with the upper group (B) or seal you territory (C)

How about D by the way !?];B[ni];W[hg];B[pg];W[qg]LB[qg:A][qi:F]
[lj:B][mj:D][oj:E][lk:C]C[Was I too passive in this invasion, or did I handle it correctly?

rev: yes and no ... i think you are one stone late  ... B and C could be made by a single stone at D ...

A is not helping

- it can be easily attacked by B gaining more influence ( don't touch ... remember !? ;)

- there is little room for black making an eye here as it can be attacket from both sides so you don't need to play here now

I like E ... sealing off black; give assistance to  F and make some pressure to the black]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[oi]LB[oh:A]C[first eye for black]
(;W[qh]LB[qg:B][ok:A]C[rev: no!

A as it's still wide open and B can connect to the upper and lower so ... i don't think its needed now.]
;B[ok];W[pf]LB[pl:A][dn:B][cq:C]C[I don't think this was a good sequence for me, I didn't read it out enough, just played it because it looked nice.

rev: ... i don't think black can be killed anymore so look what you have

it's quite hard for black to invade you corner so keep it as it is. 

but black can destroy lots of territory at the lower part! 

so A could rescue some points.

btw B and C ?];B[of];W[og];B[oh];W[oe];B[nf];W[ne];B[me];W[md]
