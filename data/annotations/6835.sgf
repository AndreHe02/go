C[alpena [1d\]: hi
gougou [1d\]: hi];B[pc]C[Dear reviewer,

This game became very unbalanced which often happens to me. I got lots of territory, my opponent a huge influence... then i lost. Can you review the game with this in mind? i'm black here.

thanks, gougou.];W[qp];B[cp];W[dc];B[oq];W[pn];B[kp];W[pe];B[nc]
LB[nd:A][qe:B][ph:C]C[reid: Hello Gougou.  The normal response for black when he wants to play along the side is A.  Of course, black can also play the joseki at B or the pincers around C too.  The game result from black O17 is very bad for black.  We'll talk about that in a few moves.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[reid: Because black played low at O17 instead of high, it is natural to want to make this aggressive hane.  If black is going to hane on the inside with R18, then of course O17 should be higher at O16.  Unfortunately, the result of this hane is not good.]
;W[pd];B[rc];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[nd]C[reid: but now the white stones are very happy.  Black has played first in this corner, but his result is less than 10 points..  White has very nice shape on the outside, worth at least 10 points, and the black stone at O17 is wasted (too close to white's thickness).

Just to hammer the point home, here's a bit of reverse analysis: if black had captured the R17 stone with R18 instead of descending at Q18, white still might play at P18.  Would black then want to play at Q18 in exchange for white O16?]
;B[qf]C[Seems w needs to add a move, no?

reid: This white shape is very strong.  It is hard for black to attack it directly, so no, I don't think white needs to defend right away.]
;W[de];B[nb]C[reid: black is playing too close to the strong white stones (the proverb says "play away from strength").  Better to leave this attack for later, I think.]
;W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[lc];W[ld]LB[md:A]C[reid: I think white should play more firmly with A.  It's going to be hard for black to make good shape here.  In the game, white loses the P19 stones partly because of this loose play at M16.]
;B[kc];W[kd]C[reid: white is pushing from behind - this helps black.]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[hc];W[id];B[fc]LB[gc:A]C[reid: Too far, as subsequent play demonstrate.  Black A is sufficient.]
;W[ic]C[reid: Of course, white pushes and cuts.];B[ib];W[jb]
C[Seems H18 is impossible here... so probably f17 was wrong...

reid: Yes, F17 is too far.  And white H18 looks better than K18.  K18 helps black make good shape.]

(;B[kb];W[hb];B[ja];W[gc];B[hd];W[gd]LB[mc:C][md:A][me:B][nf:D]
C[reid: Exchanging G16 for black H15 looks bad for white.  Better to just play F18.  Black gets G16 in sente, but black G16 is much less damaging to the white position than H15.  For example, without this exchange, black can save his P19 stones with D (after black A, white B, black C) instead of sacrificing them as happened in the game.]
;B[he];W[fb];B[md];W[me];B[mc];W[lf];B[ne];W[nf];B[od]C[what is your assessment so far?]
;W[oe];B[nd]C[reid: this is a painful gote sacrifice for white, but black's awkward shape makes it easier to swallow (and those white stones aren't doing anything strategic anymore anyway).  Probably better for black to leave tha atari at O15 for later.]
;W[og]C[reid: It looks like black has a bit more than 25 points in the upper right corner.  The lower right is fairly balanced with two stones each.  Black has one stone in the lower left corner to white's upper left corner plus central influence.  The three black stones at H15 are more a burden than anything else.  It looks like the white corner (without counting anything for the three H15 stones) can easily be as big as black's upper right.

That means it's black's single lower left stone against the white central influence plus the H15 burden (plus komi).  I think black is in trouble.]
;B[ql]C[maybe around c10 is better?];W[qj];B[rn]LB[ol:A]C[reid: Black needs to run out at A instead.  A proverb says "run before living".

It might seem like this is eye shape for both sides, and it is in some sense, but white can't make eyes here without hurting his R10 stone, so black doesn't need to rush to play here.]
;W[pl]C[reid: Ouch!  Black gets enclosed.  White is building thickness that will work well with his existing influence.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pm];W[ol];B[qn];W[om];B[po];W[qm];B[qo];W[oo]
C[reid: This looks like aji-keshi for white.  He should leave this move for later.  Perhaps he could do something in the corner later, but after black responds at Q4, there is no aji left.  A black move at P5 would not be terrible for white (and it would be gote).]
;B[pp]C[so who is better now overall?

reid: Black gained a large corner, but white's stones are working together nicely.  I think white is still ahead, just not by as much.  After this point, I think black is just trying to catch up while white only needs to use his thickness to make territory.

I think the significant part of this game is, as you mentioned in the introduction, that black went for territory while white gained outside influence.  Early in the game, influence tends to be more important than territory.  I think black should try some games where he goes for influence instead of territory.  Practise using influence to learn how to use it.

Good luck, play strong.
