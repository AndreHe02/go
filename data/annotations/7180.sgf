C[Hi. I'm DooMeeR and I will comment your game. My comments will be preceeded with ---.]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[dd];W[dq]C[My thoughts here are to play 3-4 and make it easier to enclose my corners.]
;B[po]
(;W[np]
(;B[pk]C[This just sa bit weird.eems weird, and after looking at joseki patterns, its a bit strange.

---
I agree, you should be able to gain profit.];W[jc]MA[cf][dj]
[do][jp][qo]C[Here I grab a bit point I think.

---
This is a big point indeed, although of course it is not the only one (I marked some obvious other ideas).

In fact I think you should play R5 right away (see variation later in the game).]
;B[dg]C[---
This is kind of a large and high extension, keep in mind that his corner is not enclosed at all. Black is playing for influence here.]

(;W[qm]MA[pf][qf][qg][pg][ph][qh][qi][pi][nn]C[I squeezed here. Didn't like the influence black was getting here on the right side.

---
Reducing the influence of black is a good idea. However, squeezing is not, IMO. In fact, your squeezing stone is already squeezed itself.

Instead, to reduce black's influence you could consider an invasion around R13, where there is more space for the invasion to settle.

Another good play, I think, would be to play around O6 to try to exploit black Q9 which is far from Q5. O6 would reduce black's influence while building influence for yourself (it is very high), and you threaten a play around Q7.

Another possibility would simply be R5 as in the variation.]
;B[co]C[---
Black tenuki is a little bit unexpected here, you could try to end in sente to jump out around P7 or play R5.]
;W[ep]C[---
With this response black will probably tenuki again.];B[qq]
;W[qr];B[pp]C[---
This is an error by black, R4 is much more solid than Q4.];W[qp]
C[Kill the cutting stone. Although Q4 was played, R3 looks like the cutting stone. Based on my basic ideas for the first 100 games to cut when I can, connect and save stones when I can, this seemed like a good plan.

---
Technically, black did not really cut anything here, your R7 stone is too far. However, trying to cut when possible and split your opponent's stones into more groups is often a good idea.

But here you leave a weakness at P3 which could let black capture your cutting stone (see variation).]

(;B[dm]C[---
Another weird tenuki by black. Remember, play urgent moves before big moves. White can threaten a lot with P7. The lower right is urgent. The left side is not.]
;W[cp]C[keeping the corner

---
This is a big play but there are urgent plays on the lower right. You could simply capture at S3 and now black has two stones floating in the middle of nowhere (the Q5 group). And this also secures a corner ;)]
;B[dj]C[---
Black has built a big moyo on the left. On the opposite, your three stones on the lower left look quite overconcentrated.]
;W[pf]C[---
Note that now would be a better time than before for the 3-3 invasion at C17. If black plays C17 (or somewhere to protect his san-san), his moyo on the left is huge. If you play C17, he only has a big side.

It is still too soon though, the wall black would get would be too strong at this point in the game.]
;B[pm]C[This seems to make white stronger in this area.

---
True. If black had started with an atari at R5 for instance, and you captured, and then black Q7, your R7 stone would be much weaker.]
;W[qn]C[---
Here I would have prefered R5 as now black can push at R5.]
;B[ph];W[nf]C[jump out.];B[nh]
(;W[lf]C[---
This kind of invites black to play around O16, or O15, O14 then O16. This would keep pressure on your group while building corner territory.]
;B[oq]C[---
Pushing at R5 looks much stronger, splitting your stones on the right. Here you can simply capture at S3 and treat O4 lightly.]
;W[rq]C[Forced?

---
Good.];B[bp];W[bq]C[---
Black's play was bad: either he answers at B5 right now, which is small, or he leaves a weakness at B5, which is a lot of points in the yose. If he really wanted to play here, B5 was better.

Right now he has to do something for the right side though, which is not pretty :p]
;B[on]C[---
I don't understand this move. If black wanted to strenghten his wall, Q6 would be much, much stronger.]
;W[jq]MA[nc][qc][qd][qh]C[---
Instead of making an empty triangle which makes very little territory you could push at R8 or simply keep the aji for later. Though the push is even stronger now with S7 so if black wants to make something from his S8 stone he has to answer at R8, and you now have sente.]
;B[rl]C[---

This takes about 6 points of territory but invites black to close his corner and complete his huge moyo.

3-3 would have been stronger (see variation).];B[dc]C[---
Here you go ;)];W[nc]C[Perhaps O16 is better...

---
Well it looks a bit better to contain black but will make less territory. P16 is interesting too. But I think O17 is good.]

---
This looks like a yose move :p

Black's group at P16 has terrible shape. It is basically an empty triangle, except bigger (only 6 liberties with 5 stones). You should try to attack it. The simplest way to do this is to keep it split from the black stones on the right side. A simple play at R14 and now black has to choose between defending his P16 group or his (already small) territory on the right. Maybe R16 would be more severe though.]
;B[me];W[ld]C[Tactically, as far as I can tell, White has black in a net. THe cut at N17 seemed harmless to me.

---
Yes, this is a net. However, black can still cut and capture your stones at O17. See variation.]

(;B[bo]C[---
But black chooses to take a few yose points instead.];W[ff]
;B[hf]C[A bit rude, and I dont think I handled it so well.

---
Black has a lot of influence, so this is an ok play. to reduce.

The best attack you have would be to keep black split, for instance by playing F12. But this would start a fight in black's influence, and it would be hard for you. Black would attack you while building territory in the center.]

(;W[ge]MA[kd][jd][id][ke][je][ie]C[I'd really appreciate it if you showele such a move.d me how to handle such a move

---
Your move is fine if you are ready to fight a bit, that the marked territory is not important for you, and that you want to keep open the possibilities of the F14 stone.

I showed another variation at H15 where it is the exact opposite.

A simpler answer would be H16.

Another possible answer is J15.

You can also try F12 and start a large scale fight but black has a lot of influence so this looks dangerous.

See variations.];B[hc]C[---
Now this looks like an overplay from black.];W[hb]C[---
You should just cut at H15 and attack H17 on a large scale, or H16. Here you invite black to play H15 to try and reach his overplay stone.]
;B[na]C[---
But black likes to tenuki and make endgame moves.];W[ma]C[---
This is an error, black can capture (see variation). Just play N18. You're happy to play N18, as it protects the cut at N17 and now black N15 is really taken.]

(;B[op];W[gc];B[kg];W[kf];B[jf];W[je];B[lg];W[mf]C[---
Not important.];B[kk]C[---
This is a big point for black, trying to convert all his influence in territory. Before that he could have built even more influence by reducing around M4.]
;W[jo]C[I considered K8 here instead.

---
K5 tries to extend a fragile moyo, but black can reduce around H4, and around M4 is no territory for you because of O3.

So if you want to convert the bottom into territory, instead of K5 you can simply play H4.

If you want to reduce the center you can play K8 indeed but this will end in a fight and you may lose some territory at the bottom. You can simply enter the center with F12, now that you strenghtened F14.

But attacking the upper right black group still seems more urgent.]

Not important. Black stones are already captured. See variation.]

(;W[fm]C[---
I showed a variation to show that you can keep your entrance from the top, but of course your move is better as it also takes territory.]
;B[mq];W[mp]C[Keeping black pressed

---
You are reinforcing a weak group. Now losing your group is more expensive. Black could try to fight with M4. His wall on the right and his influence on the top will hurt you during this fight.]

If black wants to reinforce his connection, O3 is better. Here P2 does not accomplish anything really interesting.]

;B[pg];W[qc]C[So I jump in.

---
You could simply play the bamboo joint at Q15. You can then take the R14 stone or play the 3-3 if black does not defend. Here the 3-3 invasion looks difficult.]

(;B[dk]C[---
No way black can tenuki here!];W[em]C[---

(;W[jl]C[---
It is not sure that your group on the upper right is alive. Q19 makes it live easily, and black has to answer by defending P13.]

You did indeed play quite well. In fact the game was hard to comment for my level as there is not that many huge mistakes from you.

We can see that black had a lot of influence but making points in the center is hard.

Black could improve by making less tenuki to take small yose points.]

The D13 black stone allowed black to block at B13, which is a few points (not a lot compared to a better enclosion like C14 though).

Black now have a wall facing your K17 stone. He won't make a lot of territory from his wall, but he will have strength to attack your stones, so you have to play on the upper side right now. Play on the right corner to build strength, this way the black wall will not have a lot to attack.

Now compare this with your move in the game, and black's response. The 3-3 is better IMO.]

This is the best direction for black. Remarks from the other directions apply, but black has a lot more influence (his wall does not face your K17 stone) and more territory. However, you do have the marked stones which will help you to reduce the black influence of the wall. This is why it is better to invade now than before.

From these diagrams, maybe we can conclude that a better strategy, instead of invading right now, would be to play near the Q16 stone to build more influence toward the future black wall, while building territory. Black has to defend his Q16 stone. When you have more or less enclosed black on the upper right, you have a strong position radiating more influence, and you can invade at C17.]

Black captured your cutting stones. So white should not try to kill black in the corner. White could try and kill the two black stones at Q5 but this does not look that easy. If white does not kill one of the black groups, he is cut in two badly shaped groups. So, your cutting stone at R4 is not that good unless you planned on sacrificing it later.]

(;W[cc]C[3-3 invasion better here, or is it not the right timing to fight close?

---
I think it is too soon. Indeed, black would get a lot of influence, while you would only get a small amount of territory.

Although, he has to choose between a wall facing D13 which would be too close, and a wall facing your K17 stone which kind of reduces his influence while not being too close from the wall.

But you can wait. If black plays C17 himself, you're happy to take a big point somewhere else.]
