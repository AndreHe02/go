;B[pn]C[I think there's nothing strange until now.];W[lo];B[jq]
C[*******************
(K3)move not too bad, but let me feel not the absolut play......

u can play (4j) replace (k3) for the reason below:
Induce white attack (3M) stones, w(3k), b(3j) after other change, u can savely take care right below corner with first hand and attact left below corner by play (3d) ...

I mean u must learn to change attact to get benifit...];W[nm]
;B[pl];W[hq]C[Here I have to demonstrate that K3 was not a bad move, but I am myself so doubtful about it!
White has a very nice shape on the right, so I see no aji to be exploited for putting some reinforcement stones in sente.
Next moves has been done in panic. I was not aware of what I'd being doing.]
;B[jo]C[*******i think ur 17th (k5) can be replaced by (f3)
the reason is:
1. u have a chance let ur 2stones stable immedly
    (2 ways to alive: from center and side u can choice     one)
2. tunr the fighting area from below to left corner 
    w(4f), b(4g), w(3g), b(4e), w(5f), b(5e), w(3e), b(3d)
    so...u can change, and (3r) and (3m) stones still can be alive by playing (2o) or (5k)]
;W[ho];B[ir]C[I felt J2 as an horrble mistake. Tha position was claiming for K7, I think, but I was afraid of some cuts, but where? I don't see any cuts right now.
Your opinion?

*******i think (k7) is better move than (2j)
he can not cut u, because u can play (3j)];W[jn];B[hr]C[Seeking for a base, I let my group being sealed in.
The result is great strenght for White, so san-ren-sei is now mere territory.
I think black is behind, now.

*****yes, black is behind, now...u must keep ballance to control the center. espacially u used san-ren-sei , u must always get benifit with fighting.]
;W[ko];B[gq];W[gp];B[fq];W[jp];B[pr]C[ur play 27th (2q) too slow...

u must play 6d now to reduce white];W[md];B[pf];W[mf];B[de]
;W[dg];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd];W[db];B[bc]
;W[bb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hc];W[ac]C[I was really happy about this sequence.
White is flattened on the second line, White has
two weak groups: N16 and C11. Maybe Black can win! Let's attack!]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[mh];W[jf];B[le];W[me];B[lf]C[*****
14M should be replace by play 13L];W[kd]C[The wonderful world of tesuji is still unknown to me.
What to do next? I think next moves are really crucuial for the final outcome.

******
the only play is 15k...];B[ld];W[lc];B[lg];W[ke];B[hb]C[here the only play is 17k]
;W[jc];B[ab];W[aa];B[jh];W[hf]C[****
after ur many wrong play...
u were attacted by white..and make ur upper stones unstable...(must run away)

Contrstly, white have alive in upper area..];B[fe]C[****
15f should replace by 14f..and u can get the chance to exchanged to attack left white 2 stones...by this way u can run away in the type of alive...]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[This is another bad mistake, I know :(];W[ce]
;B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[ad];B[fg]C[This is horrible, since now C11 becomes strong.
But What to do if white plays F13 next? Is black able to live?]
;W[df];B[fi];W[ih];B[ii];W[hh];B[gi];W[hi];B[fl];W[hj];B[cl]
;W[dk]C[this is a direction of play. Which is my eakest group? What to play next? I really have no idea.
Could you help me?];B[dl];W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[el];W[fj]C[This result is horrible. I sacrificed C14 for not being sealed in, and then I get sealed in! Crazy!
But it's too easy to comment my moves by knowing
what they will bring later... The truth is that I have no means to foresee these situations. Any hints?]

here black almost lose alread..
the reasons r :
1. left black must be dead..if white played correctly 
2. 17r and 12q still was white right to play...and can erase ur much space..
3. the group 16m-12N still dangerous...];W[eo];B[eq];W[dn];B[co]
