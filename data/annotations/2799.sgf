C[P: This match have been a fight from the very beginning. Im not used to that and I dont know if I've played well this kind of early fights

*** Hi, I'm david and i'm 1k on KGS.  all of my comments will begin with "******"]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[dd];B[cj]LB[fc:C][pi:B][qi:A][fq:D]C[****** in my opinion, this is a very weak move for b.  the most common, and obvious moves, in this position are to create a chinese opening with either A or B.  In addition, you will see C and sometimes D in pro games (especially recently).  the problem with b's move at c10 is it does nothing to help b build a moyo, or attack a corner.  all it does is prevent you from making a large moyo on that side of the board.    

i took lessons from a 6d on igs for a while and i played this very same move.  he stopped, and ask me what in the world was i thinking.  i said, well, it prevents you from making a moyo.  he said, yes, if that was my plan - otherwise, you pretty much wasted a move and let me immediately begin to dictate the pace of the game.]
;W[qe]C[***** good, you too advantage of b's move to approach the 2-3 stone.]
;B[nd];W[pg]LB[qd:B][qh:A]C[ P: This is not joseki, but I dont feel it as a bad move. What should black do to punish the non-joseki, if he should?

****** i'm not exactly sure what you were aiming to accomplish with this move.  remember, josekis are not simply sequences to memorize - each of the plays has a purpose.  i don't see an immediate purpose behing this move other than to move out into the center a bit.  playing at A gives that group a good base, but your move leaves it vulnerable for b to steal the base away.  if i was b, i would play B to prevent you making a base in the corner and to force you into an overconcentrated shape.]
;B[pj]LB[qc:A]C[ P: This is the answer I guess

**** this is only one possible answer.  since he left the corner open, you should have no trouble making a base here.  A would be the obvious next play for white.]
;W[rc]LB[qc:A]C[ P: too slow?

***** this does not give you quite as much room as A would.]
;B[qb]LB[jc:C][cf:A][cn:B]C[ P: Too slow too

***** yes, i agree.  w already has good access to the center, so there isn't a whole lot of concern now.  b should ignore that and play at A, B, or C.]
;W[qi]LB[ng:A][qh:B]SQ[pg]C[***** i understand your concern, but this is an overly cautious move and gives b sente.  even if b plays low toward your base, you can still play A.  let me point out here that you can now see why the marked stone would be better placed at B.]
;B[qj]
(;W[lc]C[ P: too weak to attack a three stones group

***** this is the right idea, but you might want to play a bit back.  see the variation.]
;B[rb]C[ P: Very bad


*** yes, this is too slow and submissive.];W[ic]C[**** good.]
;B[cf]
(;W[bd]C[ P: Is not really a threat, and dont make many territory, and left f17  as a weak point

**** yes, in this position f17 can be a weakness.  see the variation for a common pattern in pro games.]
;B[gc]C[ P: Too early];W[fc]LB[ef:A][ch:B]SQ[gc]C[**** your play is a bit too locally oriented.  A would be a nice attack on a larger scale.  it would do three things at once.  first, it would move your white group out into the center.  second, it would threaten an invasion at B.  third, it aims to capture the marked b stone on a large scale.  b can defend both B and the marked stone.  so he will have to leave one of them weak.]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[ge]LB[ie:A][le:B]C[P: He's becoming heavy, and I built the posibility of attack the left group. I dont feel now  the j17 grou too weak, but I should not forget them

***** yes, it is common for w to play at A or B sometime soon to protect that white group.]
;W[ef]C[**** great splitting attack.];B[eg];W[fg];B[ie];W[ke]
LB[jd:A]C[***** this move leaves too many weaknesses in this situation.  since b has moved on the offensive here, a move like A would both defend, and prevent b from capturing any of your stones to make a base.]
;B[jd];W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[fb];W[eb];B[hb];W[ib];B[kd];W[ld]
;B[le]SQ[ke]C[******now, the marked w stone has been wasted.  you were not able to use it to force b to do what you wanted.  instead, b used the stone to force you.]
;W[me];B[lf];W[md];B[kf];W[od];B[rd];W[qd];B[qc];W[oc];B[pd]
;W[pe];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb]C[ P: Not necesary and gives me sente


***** yes, given the situation on the left side of the board, this is very small.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[eh]C[ P: D12 better?];B[di];W[cm]C[***** good move.]
;B[dl];W[dm]LB[dl:A][jq:C][nq:B]C[ P: Too slow

**** yes.  if b is going to give you a free move by playing A, then take the free move and play B or C.]
;B[pm]
(;W[jq]LB[qq:A]C[**** i'm not sure if i will be able to explain this well, and i'm not even sure this would be the best move, but i would have a tendency to play A in this situation.  see variations for why i would play A.  the marked move simply begs b to defend this moyo - about 25 points of territory.  however, the w moyo is still very open to invasion.]
;B[oq];W[fq];B[cq]LB[dq:A][mq:B]SQ[fq]C[***** this is the only move here.  this also shows the limitation of the marked w stone.  it would have been better to play at A (instead of F3) to secure the corner.  the triangle w stone would still be able to extend to B if b invaded around h3 or so.  in addition, any b invasion there would be very risky and would come under severe attack.  see variation for how this would look.]

(;W[cp]C[**** it would probably be better to block the other way.  w will end up overconcentrated no matter what, so he should make the most out of it.   see variation.]

(;B[dq];W[eq];B[bp]
(;W[br]C[***** this is the mistake.  see the variation.];B[bq]
;W[bo];B[ar]C[ P: I dont like how he has built his right corner while I dont have mine. But I dont know what I did incorrect if there is something.]
;W[el]LB[lq:A]C[ P: I try to built a moyo to contrarest his corner


**** this is one possible way, but i think it would be better to play at A.  if i was b, i would definitely play at A after you played the marked stone.  with a b play at A, the game is pretty much over.   see variation]

(;B[cl];W[bl]LB[lq:A]C[ P: Bad, i'll loose the sente

**** yes, this is small.  A is still the best move on the board.]
;B[bk];W[bm];B[ek]C[**** again, to focused on the local fight.  lost sight of the global situation.]
;W[fl];B[lq]C[***** this is a winning move.];W[jo];B[lo]LB[im:A]
SQ[ie][kf][lf][pj][pm]C[***** given that b has the lower left corner, and the large moyo on the right, this is probably the conservative move.  however, with the marked b stones, i would still have a tendency to play at A.   b has a lot of thickness that he can run to.]
;W[km];B[bs]C[***** unnecessary.];W[fk]SQ[km]C[**** great move.  especially with the marked w stone in place.]
;B[ej]C[**** this seems a bit too passive for me.];W[fj];B[dk]
C[***** this was absolutely an unnecessary move.  b is about to lose the chance to reduce the w moyo.]
;W[kj]C[***** great.];B[ih];W[ij];B[fi];W[gi]LB[re:E][ag:C]
[ri:B][ol:A][kr:D]C[***** if we look at the situation here, let's count up where b and w stand.  b has about roughly 40 points on the right + 7 points in the top right + 2 points in the bottom left + maybe 7 points on the left + maybe 5 points on the top center (this is being generous) which gives b 61 points.  w has 11 points in the top left, around 7 points on the top right and top center, and around 45 points in the lower left (i'm counting conservatively for w) which gives w around 63 points.  so, it is a very close game and every point will count in the endgame.  
As the board stands now, the biggest points for w are A, B, C, D, and E.  A is sente, but depending on how b plays, w may end in gote.  however, i would say this is the most urgent move.  if b gets to play at n7, b is going to make about 15 more points.  B is most likely sente, otherwise you can make a big reduction by playing at S9.  so, B is worth around 6 or so points.  D is probably sente also for the same reason and worth around 9 points.  E is probably sente, but it is not definite because it it only worth about 5 points in gote.  C would also be sente and a nice reducing move worth about 8 points or so.  by the way, my counting is probably a bit off, but it should be relatively close.  the key thing to look at here, is that A, B, and D are w's best moves here.]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[ei];W[nn]C[**** this is too deep.]
(;B[oo]LB[lm:A]C[***** this is too defensive.  the best response for b would be at A.  see variation.]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[ln];B[no];W[mn];B[pi]C[**** this is a good move for b.]
;W[qh];B[mj];W[ol]C[**** great.  this is the only move in this situation.]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[oj];W[ri];B[rj];W[on]LB[sj:A]C[**** i would rather play at A next.  the marked w move might not be sente.]
;B[pn];W[mk];B[om];W[nm];B[lk];W[lj];B[nk];W[ml];B[pk];W[nl]
;B[nj];W[ko]C[**** good.];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ng]LB[sj:A]C[**** i still think A is better.]
;B[mb];W[re];B[sc];W[ig];B[jg];W[hg];B[jh];W[lh]C[**** hmm, things just got interesting.  i missed this.  very nice play.]
;B[lg];W[mh]LB[kh:A]C[**** i think A is better here.];B[kh]
C[*** now b has two eyes.];W[lp];B[mq];W[kp]LB[ag:B][sj:A]C[***** this is small.  A and B are much bigger.]
