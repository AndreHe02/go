C[Greetings,

    I was 11-12k on kgs, before I took a break. Now I played a few games again and would be interested in a few pointers.

   Especially, where I play to soft and use bad shapes.

Andreas.];B[pc];W[cd];B[qp];W[dp];B[nq];W[ec]C[Not sure, about moves 4 and 6. Basically thought I try it and see what happens.

P:  This is reasonable so far.];B[qf];W[dj]C[P:  This might be too slow.  A cut at D13 and D7 are still possible.  Black has enclosed two corners, you have enclosed one corner and have two weak groups elsewhere on the board.  Keep in mind the balance of power and territory.  Black's enclosing of the second corner should prompt a more active play.  D10 here doesn't demand any particular response from black.]
;B[cn]
(;W[fq]C[P:  This is good, however this is one of those situations where this alternate move can come in handy:]
;B[bp]C[P:  When black makes this move, it's a good idea to follow him into the corner.]
(;W[jd]C[P:  It's obvious that you're avoiding playing on the right side right now.  This is a mistake, the right side is huge right now.]
;B[cr];W[iq];B[kq]
(;W[io]C[P: Even though a "one space jump is rarely wrong", you still need to make an escape move that pressures your opponant.  This is safe for black to ignore.]
;B[hc];W[mc]C[Wanted to prepare a possible attack on h17

P:  Now that gap around D13 comes into play.];B[he];W[fe];B[jb]
;W[lf]C[Doesn't look really like good shape, when I look at it now.

P:  Not if living is your goal.  This shape has other uses though.]
;B[qj]C[I'm getting concerned about the right side now.

P:  You're about 10 moves too late for that.  You should have gone here before move 10.]
(;W[oo]C[P:  Consider these two alternates.];B[op];W[po];B[qo]
(;W[qn];B[rn];W[pm]C[This the right approach for something like that ?

P:  You're going to have to scramble to live or connect to something living.  Right now, Black has two corners and a bunch of side territory, you have one corner and a couple of weak groups.  Play your forcing moves before it's too late.  see alt.]
;B[qm];W[pn]C[Doesn't look good now.];B[ql]
(;W[ml]C[Not sure where to play, but didn't want to leave it all alone right now.]

(;W[en]C[Trying to build the bottom a little. Maybe wrong direction, as I might push him to my top left.

P:  Yeah, you want to drive the enemy towards your strength, not your weakness.]

(;W[ne]C[P:  If you're trying to make eyeshape, you should do it by threatening to take eyeshape away elsewhere.]

P:  Unnessisary.  Count your liberties.];B[ke];W[pd];B[qd];W[qc]

(;W[hk]C[P:  I think it would have been worth it to push one more here]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[rb];W[ok];B[qb]C[Hmm, maybe just ignore ?

P:  I wouldn't give up that corner so easily.  If you're going to ignore, play around B9 instead]
(;W[pb];B[bj]
(;W[ci];B[bi];W[bh]C[To soft ?

P:  Not much else you can do except prevent that situation from happening in the first place...of course, you can always invade.]

(;W[cq]C[P:  This is one of the two cuts for the knight's move, but I think the other one is more interesting.  Be willing to sacrifice one stone to invade more deeply.]

C[Blunder, don't know what I was thinking there.

I guess, the game was quite close before and just normal endgame left, with possibilities to win/lose only a few points.

Black has more sente and big endgamemoves left though at first glance.

P:  You would have won if you played calmly, I think.  You could have come out a lot worse with that black framework on the right side, fortunately for you, black played low and you were able to keep him low.  Just try to make every move something that black -must- respond to and you'll come out ahead.]
