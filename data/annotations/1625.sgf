C[Dear reviewer,

This game started february, 22nd and ended august, 28th. It was played at ItsYourTurn, an email-game-like go server, where you can think about your moves as long as you like.

My idea behind playing an equal game against a stronger player (I'm 4k, Yogi is 2d) was to see, where my weaknesses are. For every move I took at least one hour to think about, while my opponent responded almost immediately.

I've written down the essence of my thoughts for every move. I've included them in this file.

I also want to mention, that I used books (joseki and fuseki), but did not play out any moves on the board, as I cannot do this in reallife games, too.

I would be happy, to know, where my reasoning was correct (and produced the correct results) and were I could have done better (and how, of course).

Thank you, Berni


[orionsky\]:
All my (the reviewers) comments are preceded by the tag [orionsky\] to indicate it is me writing. Since there many questions asked in this review, I concentrate on answering them.]
;B[pd]C[First I had to choose an opening strategy. Because I'm most familiar with san-ren-sei, I decided to play 4x4.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[cp];B[ep]C[According to my fuseki-book this is better than san-ren-sei.

[orionsky\]:
Personally, I consider san-ren-sei a bit slow, so I rather play the small Chinese Opening.
In this case, an approach move in the lower left is the right thing to do, forming an ideal extension from the lower right hoshi (star point) while preventing a white corner enclosure, which would make a black play on the left side quite difficult.]
;W[eq];B[fq]C[I had to choose between a(D4) and b(this move). The continuation of this move works better with the marked stone(Q4), than those of a(D4).

[orionsky\]:
This is the only move. It combines well with the hoshi in the lower right corner.]
;W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[The 4th line is consistent with the two marked stones (Q16 and Q4).]
;W[nc];B[pf]C[First I thought of pincering at a(L16), because I didn't like the idea of white playing b(K16). But my fuseki-book told me, that c(O17) should have been at d(R6), because d forestalls a double-wing-formation. So by just playing this double-wing-formation, I should do well.

[orionsky\]:
Sounds reasonable.];W[jd];B[qj]C[Here I had to decide between attacking at a(D15) and defendig at b or c (Q10/R10). I've choosen the last one, as it is consistent with my former move.

Why c and not b? It has a good followup at d(P10). And I also did not like the invasion at R12.

[orionsky\]:
This is a mistake. If not the move itself (it is actually quite ok, but should rather have been one line higher), then the reasoning that stands behind it.
c is a move that seems to claim territory on the right side. However, all your stones are played as to radiate influence. Thus, your last move does not quite fit in with your moyo strategy, which is to dominate a large area and wait for your opponent to invade. After that, you can solidify some of your moyo to become territory while attacking the intruder.]
;W[de];B[oj]LB[ci:a][jj:b]C[Here I had to find a decision.

a) invade the left side
b) reduce arround the tengen
c) strengthen my own position

I've choosen c) since, when white continues by closing the left side, I'll jump out at a(E7), and my moyo will grow.

[orionsky\]:
This certainly is a mistake. It is too slow, there is no significant difference in the position whether this stone is sitting there or not. It does not (!) secure more territory, neither builds it more influence than there was before.
An important method of getting stronger is to give each of your stones a distinct meaning.
One possibility is to play at a (C11), saying "you must not take territory on the left" or around b (K10), saying "the lower right quarter is mine if you don't invade immediately".

It is difficult to give your move such a clear mission.];W[qn]
C[In my eyes this move looks as if it is on the wrong side. a(O4) might attack the four stones at the left.

[orionsky\]:
White appears quite confident. :)];B[qo]LB[ro:a]C[In my oppinion the only move.

[orionsky\]:
Yes, but you should keep in mind the move at a (S5), which is also good. Personally, I play this if I want to claim a large corner, especially against weaker opponents who cannot handle it properly.]
;W[on];B[pn]C[Here I had a lot of possibilities.

a(O4) is too gently.

b(Q7) tries to make white heavy, but white will probably ignore and play at a(O4) or so.

c(N6) let's white attack my corner.

d(Q6) looks good. If white doesn't respond,  I can leave the situation as it is. If white responds, it will be b(Q7), and all the joseki following it, look good.

[orionsky\]:
A move at either b or c would turn out bad quite soon. b, because it gives white many opportunities to play kikashi (and by the way violating the principle "don't touch a stone you want to attack") and c, because the black position would be too thin afterwards. Also, the purpose of a move at c would be to kill white, I could find no other meaning.
The proper play is probably at a, explanation given later.]
;W[pm];B[po];W[om];B[np]TR[po][pn][pm][om]C[Joseki is a(R7), but because of my marked stones at P10 and R10, white might ignore and play b(O4).
So I decided to play there myself.

[orionsky\]:
Due to the exchange of the marked stones (b Q6, w Q7, b Q5, w P7), white got a base to jump out with his next move. If this exchange would not have been played, white could not safely jump as far as he can now, he would have been left with a thinner position. The only benefit black has is the secure corner, but white could not hope to invade there anyway, leaving his group on the outside weak.]
;W[ln];B[ll]LB[lp:a]C[My aim was, to get power from the attack on this group, to have a base for invading the left and upperside later. This move also keeps the pressure upon the group.

This move will later help cutting at a(N6).

[orionsky\]:
Too thin. You should rather take the territory you started building on the lower side than playing moves of doubtful value. If you played at a (M4), white still would have needed to defend his group, giving you the opportunity to invade the left side.
With your move it is too easy for white to settle himself.]
;W[kp];B[jm]LB[nk:a]C[In consitency with my last move, I've decided to surround white.

[orionsky\]:
As long as white can play at a (O9) anytime he wants to, he cannot be completely surrounded.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[An atari at a(K5) or b(J4) doesn't seem to be severe. So I could look for other means. Cutting at c(L3) seems not to work. (White d(M4) and my cutting stone will be captured or useless.)

e(M3) gives room to the corner and also attacks white.

[orionsky\]:
This is not so good. If white connects (which he certainly will do), he can later use your stone for kikashis against it, thus maybe building eye space along the side or securing his connection. Either way, this move will be too close to whites group as to be a benefit rather than a burden.

On the other hand, it is very difficult to find a move which makes some sense in this position.]
;W[lp]C[[orionsky\]:
See? Although I would at once have connected, this move shows the drawback of your attack.]
;B[mq];W[kq];B[jo]C[Now an atari at a(K5) looks severe, so I've decided to play there myself. This also stabilizes my position.

[orionsky\]:
No, you make this kind of move if you want to kill white. If you don't, you rescue a worthless stone (it does not cut anything, neither helps it surrounding territory). Your move is almost certainly neutral.]
;W[hq];B[cg]C[It looked not good to me to defend my three stones at the left, as after a(G5) some aji still remains. So I decided to invade at b(C13) which looked more important.

In retrospective I think that a(G5) or something like this would have been better.

[orionsky\]:
No, this move shows the right attitude. Investing even more in the lower side and letting white play on the left side first would be the end of the game.]
;W[dj];B[me]LB[oc:a][ob:b][pc:c]C[White a(D10) threatens to cut at b(L7). So I've decided to protect this cuttingpoint with c(K9). But before doing so, I played kikashi at d(N15).

[orionsky\]:
What is this? Forcing your opponent to take territory? If you play in this area, one of the moves a (P17), b(P18) or c(Q17) would be appropriate since they take secure territory. Your move does not accomplish anything (Always remember to give your moves a meaning!).]
;W[ld];B[il]C[a(J8) feels better than b(K9). This move also enables me to cut at c(N6).

[orionsky\]:
Is black so far ahead that he can afford such a slow move? True, there is a cut there, but your lone stone on the left is far more important.]
;W[go];B[mo]C[As white hasn't protected the cut at a(N6), I've decided to cut there myself. This is some sort of furikawari, I get the right and white the bottom left.

In retrospective it looks as if this was too early, because it is gote.

[orionsky\]:
Hm, but letting white capture the three stones without getting anything in return wouldn't be convincing either, would it?]
;W[kn];B[mn];W[hm];B[gk]C[Here I've decided to ignore the cut at a(K6) as the cutted stones are not important and to extend my moyo instead. There are two posibilities, b(L14) and c(G9).

I've descided to play c(G9), which makes use of my three stones at the bottom. After I saw whites response at d(L13) I regretted my move. But black b(L14), white c(G9) looks good for white too.

[orionsky\]:
To me it seems most important to settle your lone stone on the left, so that you don't have to worry about it when dealing with the top.]
;W[kg];B[ec]C[This is the last time to invade the upper side. If I'll wait longer, my opponent closes the upper side and I'll have to resign. The next few moves are an invasion joseki I've  found in a book. The results of this joseki looked quite good for me in this situation, so I wondered, where white would depart from it.

[orionsky\]:
Hm, having two invasions at the same time on the board is usually quite devestating. Settling your weak groups in time is very important. In this situation, black has no real chance to win.]
;W[ed];B[fc];W[db];B[fd];W[hc]C[Here the joseki-move is a(F15).]
;B[ef]LB[ee:a][fe:b][ff:c]C[This stone is connected to my three stones at the upper side (the ladder is good for me). It also puts some pressure at the white top left group, which might help a(C13) later.

[orionsky\]:
Which ladder? White can easily cut with the sequence W a (E15), B b (F15), W c (F14). Although this does not seem to be the best move, you should not miss this sequence!]
;W[df]C[This was a good move, I've not forseen. It breaks the ladder and also protects the left side.]
;B[if]C[Here I threaten to cut at a(L14), in the hope to get out quickly and be able to connect.

[orionsky\]:
Again, this is too thin. you cannot hope both to cut and to rescue your whole group.]
;W[he];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg];W[dg];B[ch]C[My top group is almost connected, so I can afford to defend the C13 stone (a).]
;W[bf];B[cj];W[ck];B[ei]C[This move connects to the right. I've seen, that I have to give up my 3 stones at the top (marked with triangle), but it looked impossible, to live with the leftside group and to keep those three stones.
So I had to choose. This move has the advantage, that I still can use the three stones at the bottom (marked with squares).

[orionsky\]:
OK, and this quite nicely shows how disadvantegous it is to have two weak groups on the board, you usually cannot save both of them.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[fg]C[This move made me wonder, as the cut at a(F15) works without it, and I'm happy to play b(G12).

[orionsky\]:
Just careless reading by white. :)];B[gh];W[fe];B[kf]C[When white is able to keep his stone at a(L13), I'm far back in territory, so I tried to cut it appart. (I've read out, that it works).]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[jf];W[hg];B[le]C[I cannot cut at a(J12), what I read out, because white can capture my whole leftside group by just giving atari at b(H12). So I decided to remove the aji of white c(M14). d(M15) also threatens to run into the upper side later.]
;W[ii];B[lh]C[Here I had no idea how to continue. a(M12) protects some of my territory. But it looks, as if I've already lost the game.

[orionsky\]:
Yes, a long time ago. The best move would probably have been to secure the corner around a (Q17). Nevertheless, this would not have been enough.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[pc]C[White got the upper side,  stabilized the top, so a(M15) was a useless move and still has good moves at the left. (e.g. b(F12)).

I think, that my mistakes must have been made earlier. So it was time to resign.

[orionsky\]:
I hope I could make clear the most important points. To give a brief summary, you should
1. try to settle weak groups early.
2. give every single move a meaning.
3. not play too thin moves.])
