C[dias: Thanks a lot for reviewing my game. This game was recently played on KGS. I'm playing white. I lost 10,5 points. Me and my opponent sissen are both 8K on KGS. I see some obvious mistakes in the game, but there's lots of complicated moments, which I cannot analize by myself. I left some questions in comments.

========================================

**Notes**

Around move 234, there are two strange, empty places. I don't know how i got them that way, but they just appeared. You can ignore them.

Sometimes, I didn't add all the variations, as it would take weeks too do it, instead, i added the most simple variation.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cj];W[nq]C[dias: what should I play here? Is O3 normal move or not?

========================================

Marking: O3 is the standard kakari, any other kakari are exceptions when the surrounded position doesn't fit.]
;B[qm];W[qq]C[Marking: Too early, if black answers correctly, he'll gain a lot thickness. (see variation)]
(;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[np]TR[nr]C[dias: I'm not sure about the correct joseki move here...

========================================

Marking: O2 is the normal move here. Black can push and threaten too either take the corner or too attack the outside stones.]
(;B[pj]TR[jc][jd]C[Marking: Right now, the top is more important.]
;W[ph]TR[qf]C[dias: this is probably a mistake

========================================

Marking: Yes, if black attacks at Q 14, white will have too run into the centre while black gets territory and influnece on the side.]
;B[cg];W[nc];B[qf];W[qc]C[Marking: Again, too early, for the same reason as R3.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf];W[sd]
;B[ne]TR[nd]C[Marking: O16 is stronger in terms of shape.];W[ld]
;B[nh];W[oi];B[pi];W[oh];B[qh];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[ng]
TR[lj][mj][mk]C[Marking: It's better too jump out right now.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[bd];W[cc]TR[gc][bf]C[diasL: it seems to me, that the move in the middle of the lower side is bigger...

========================================

Marking: Acttually, this is a good move, as it defends your group. It makes miai of making a base at G17 and a placement tesuji at B14.]
(;B[iq];W[fq];B[lr];W[lp];B[gr];W[fr];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp];W[ho]
C[dias: I guess, I should have protect upper side here...

========================================

Marking: The upperside is big, but this double-hane is a very strong move, as it threatens too shut down the black group.]
;B[io];W[hn];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[dr];B[hc];W[mh]TR[fc]C[Marking: F17 would now be perfect.]
;B[nb];W[mc];B[kb];W[mb];B[fb];W[in]TR[cc][dd]C[Marking: The marked white stones are in danger if black defends at B17!]
(;B[jo];W[mn];B[jn];W[jm];B[on];W[rq];B[rp]
(;W[dl]TR[cl]C[Marking: This move is bad, as you should invade with thicknes, not creating territory in the centre. C8 is correct here(I put some variations in the tree, but their not the only paterns)]
;B[cl];W[dk];B[hj];W[ck];B[bk];W[dj];B[ci];W[di];B[hh];W[dh]
;B[ch];W[dg]C[dias: I'm really not sure, what I should play further. It looks like I should attack middle group (which I have done), but I'm not sure about the direction of attack to make a maximum profit.

========================================

Marking: As I stated earlier in the game, you should've invaded the left area of black. Now your walls are more or less useless.]
;B[ji];W[gi];B[hi];W[jj]C[Marking: When you attack, it's basic not too attach, as your opponent's group will get stronger.]

;B[gm];W[cn];B[bn];W[bo];B[bm];W[cf];B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[db];B[fc];W[fd]
(;B[jc]TR[or]SQ[mr]C[dias: here I definitely have sente, and it looks, like I have chances to win. After analizing the situation, it seems to me, that B17, M3, G13 and O8 must be good, but I'm not sure, which is bigger. Still, I haven't play either one of them.

========================================

Marking: Notice that black has a strong tesuji at P2. N2 is deffinetly the biggest point now.]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[qi];B[qg];W[qj];B[qk];W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[sf]
;W[sb];B[gg];W[ff]TR[id][sp]C[Marking: This is a small move, and gote.T4 is strong in double-sente. J 16 is also big sente, as it threatens the placement at J18.]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[bq]TR[bp]C[Marking: It's better too connect at B4 now, as shape won't matter in this postion anymore. Now black has a ko threat at B4.(ussefull for half-point ko's)]
;B[ab];W[ba]C[Marking: Very small, there are much bigger points on the board.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[sq]
(;W[rr]C[Marking: there's nothing too be afraid of here. You should read first, and think later.]

(;W[nd]C[dias: this move seems to be absolutely unnecessary. I just have lost sente.

========================================

Marking: i don't see why, as there's not any stingy tesuji from black in this postition.]

C[dias: here F13 looks bigger.

========================================

;W[eg];B[gf];W[fe]TR[ge]C[Marking: It's safe enough too play at G 15.]

========================================

Marking: Overall, you have good techniques/tesuji's. However, you can't seem too use your stones in full.(for example, you didn't invade the C9 area when you had thickness)]
