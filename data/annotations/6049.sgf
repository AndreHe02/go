AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy 15 k+ player in IGS, this is my game against 16k.

overall I think we both make stupid mistake.and I hope you can improve my technique

thanks in advance


H: Hello, this is Hannes (6k KGS). I will review for white and mark my comments with an "H"]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd]
(;W[pi]TR[ph]C[H: The objective should be clear: attack the single black stone not necessarily for capturing it, but for building walls and/or territory. However, I am not convinced of this move  (see possible black follow up), as black might push between this stone and the two whites above.

Playing Q12 would have stabilized white while putting black under pressure. (Alhtough a contact move might provoke close fighting)]

(;B[qi];W[pj];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj]TR[pg]C[H: marked Q13 still is a weak point in white's shape]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[cp]TR[cq][jq]C[trick play

H: note that white's two stones are very weak. Strengthehing them should be the next aim (playing K3, for example).

If white wants to invade, C3 is the point.

However, if white invades in the corner, black might strengthen his position while defending. White's two stones will then look even more weak]
;B[co]C[wrong. this is what I want. should play E3 instead]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er]C[H: this sequence makes black very strong, here, so the two whites are more and more in danger.]
;W[cr];B[eq];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[io]
;W[kp]TR[gq][fr][is]C[is this ok?

H: Good outcome for white, but black had no need pushing white on the fourth line. an early cut at G3 would have been better.

Note that whites territory is still very open on the left. Black may force at F2 and then play the monkey's jump at J1]
;B[cm];W[cf]TR[id][ch][qn][nq]C[H: This produces a weak group. If white wants to invade, J17 or C12 are good moves (where white can play a two-point extension as a follow up. O3 and R6 are also big moves.]
;B[ch]LB[df:A][ef:B]C[what's the best way here? should I tke the corner?]

(;W[df]C[Personally I think it's slow and maybe ikken-tobi is better, but I think if I do tht (see variation

H: The one space jump is not bad. See variations attacking from above (D15)]
;B[eh];W[ff];B[gh];W[gd]TR[cc][cd]C[mistake. where should I go here?

H: you can still invade at C17, or make at least one eye at C16]
;B[ee];W[ef]C[H: As black can cut, white should probably leave this situation alone and try to settle on the upper side. C16/C17 is still open to white.]
;B[fe];W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[hd];W[he];B[id];W[ld]TR[kf][hg][hk]
[ik][il]C[I think I must attak before upper board come to black

H: No bad idea in general, but here white has another weak group. Black can have fun attacking both by splitting M16 from the left group.

If white wants to reduce territory, playing around J19 would have been better. 

Or connect by the H13-L14 sequence];B[lc];W[kc];B[mc]C[I think L16 is better a

H: Black does not need to get involved into close fights. He can afford securing his corner.]
;W[kd];B[gc];W[ib]TR[je]C[H: The white group is still weak. Better connect at K15]
;B[je]C[H: Now, black splits, attacking both groups at once]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[me];B[kf];W[jg];B[hg];W[if];B[kg]TR[hk][ik]C[H: no need to push any further. Black should secure around J9]
;W[jh];B[jo];W[ko]C[H: Mistake, leading to two more cutting points (where this white group is still vulnerable on the left)]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[kq];W[lq];B[iq];W[kr];B[gq];W[ir];B[hr];W[kh]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[km];W[ij]C[H: Good move. Reducing black while making white's own group stronger]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[fi];W[ii];B[hk];W[bm];B[bl];W[qn]
;B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or]
;B[rr];W[rp];B[rq];W[sp];B[sq];W[ro];B[qs];W[sk]TR[gb][cc][cd]
[pg][ik]C[H: Not a bad choice as white cannot both: seal black in and reduce his territory. However, there are more profitable moves like the ones marked with a triangle.]
;B[rk];W[sl];B[sj];W[qk]C[H: Misreading];B[sm];W[rm];B[qm]C[I don't know why, but my opponent letting those 2 stones alive.]
;W[sn];B[rl];W[sm];B[pl];W[ol];B[og]TR[pg]C[H: The weakness at Q13 falls on white's feet.]

;W[ok];B[om];W[on];B[pn];W[pm];B[nr];W[nq];B[om];W[cl]TR[ml]
[pm]C[H: I wonder if there is a need to start a Ko fight. P7 is not important for white. Playing at N8 would have been better.]
;B[nl]C[I think if black don't want to ko fight anymore black should close the ko

H: Apparently, black choose to take on the fight. But he does not have big threats.]
;W[pm];B[os];W[rj]C[H: Good. That's definitively more that black gets on teh lower side.]

H: Actually just a small mistake. Don't worry too much. But you are right. The consequence is big.]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[hh];W[jj];B[jk];W[rh]TR[jh]C[H: white *must* go for life with the K12 group]
;B[bh];W[bj];B[ce]C[H: now it is too late. It's only because of a mistake (black's side, this time), that white lives]
;W[de];B[cd];W[be];B[bd];W[bg];B[ae]TR[ah]C[H: A12 would have killed]
;W[ah];B[bf];W[cg];B[ag];W[af];B[nf];W[mf];B[ag];W[fh];B[ai]

;W[ah];B[ai];W[ne];B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[rd];B[ri]C[H: black again does not defend in the upper right]

TR[gb][hb]C[H: not necessary. Better defend on the left (G18/G19)]
;W[gb]C[H: Good move.];B[fb];W[fc]C[overplay I missed read here]

;W[or];B[js]C[Big mistake. Black should connect at O1];W[ns]
;B[oq];W[nl];B[lk]C[H: back apparently forgot about the Ko. Score estimation says B+14.5. Again a single mistake turns the overall standing
