AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Can you give some advice on the opening or some parts I need to improve, because even though I won it's was pretty close because i'm quite sure i'm stronger than 7k but my games still end up close.

GL: Hi Simon, I'm Graham Lamburn, was around 1d KGS last I checked, although I've not really played any serious games there for a couple of years. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can (marked with GL:) and have tried to answer your questions, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[cn];B[fq];W[cf]
(;B[fc]C[GL: My first comment would be a psychological one as much as a game specifics one - none of these responses are necessarily bad (even globally), but had you considered many alternatives? My initial impression is that you're already letting White dictate the pace of the game, and C6 + C14 + sente may make things a bit easier for White in the long run.

Had you considered pincering here?];W[bd];B[cc];W[di];B[ch]
C[GL: An interesting shot, but too soon I feel. Pincering in the top right seems fairly urgent as White still owes a move up there. You don't want to end up with a weak group here that gives White some level of control, particularly not in a handicap game.]
;W[ef];B[ci];W[cj];B[bj]C[GL: Painful...];W[ck];B[bk];W[bl]
C[GL: Unusual choice for White, I can't see a benefit to this instead of simply extending.]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh];B[fg];W[fi];B[eg];W[fe];B[ff];W[de]
C[GL: A bit awkward, White would prefer E15 to take away sente peeps from Black.]
;B[ed];W[bc]C[GL: Baffling!]
(;B[ic]C[GL: The first serious blunder of the game. White's just handed settling all your stones on a platter, and still isn't fully alive in the corner. You must cut.]
;W[ee]
(;B[hf]C[GL: Better the other way, you don't want White to push into the top.]
;W[he];B[ie];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[if];W[jd]C[GL: This is a really awkward result for Black locally, and you've mostly fixed O17's issues for White.]
;B[ii]C[is this a good move becuase i was worried about getting cut

GL: Yes, this is fine, as long as you don't play G16 next move!]

(;W[jc];B[gd];W[ge]C[GL: Now H12 is a real threat for White.]

(;B[bb];W[db];B[cb];W[hh];B[hg]C[is there a better move to connect my stones?

GL: Not really now White has G15 on the board.];W[ih];B[bg]
C[Cool [3k\]: ?? 1k];W[cd];B[nq]C[GL: A very big point, but not urgent. B14 or L14 is still critical now that dragon is so big and still not full alive. B14 has the advantage that White becomes marginally unsettled too.]
;W[hq];B[bp];W[qn];B[kq]C[GL: Pincering R6 is also an option]
;W[kp];B[jq]C[Good!];W[ho]
(;B[fn]C[one space jump better?

GL: Yes, although I'd prefer M4 or pincering R6 to either of them. It feels like you're being a touch greedy about letting White have anything anywhere ;)]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]C[So very painful for Black.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[go];W[do]
(;B[cp]C[GL: H4 seems better here. Sure, you drop a few points in the corner, but you fix all your other issues which are both big and urgent.]
;W[hp];B[gl];W[il];B[hk]
(;W[ji]C[GL: A misplay by White. J9 feels severe.];B[ik];W[jk]
;B[jj];W[kj];B[jl];W[ij];B[im];W[kl];B[jm];W[jp];B[hn]C[GL: Mostly alive, but again making rather uncomfortable "internal" moves. You need to be a bit careful that G6 stays a real eye.]
;W[ak];B[ai];W[bf];B[kf];W[jg];B[ke]C[i feet this group was holding me back the entire game because i had to make two eyes which let my opponent gain points

GL: Yes, I agree. Even after the missed cut earlier, you kept leaving it for White to play there first, which then gave him 10-15 extra forcing moves. If you have a big, unsettled group, making it unconditionally alive is enormously important.]
;W[ld];B[mf];W[of]
(;B[ne]C[GL: Awkward shape, see var...];W[oe];B[od];W[nd];B[nf]
C[GL: Very uncomfortable indeed :(];W[og];B[mh];W[qg];B[rf]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[rg];B[qb];W[ng];B[mg];W[ni];B[mi];W[nj];B[kg]
;W[le];B[gh];W[gf]C[isn't g11 better for white

GL: Yes, much better.];B[gg];W[gi];B[kh];W[lf];B[jh];W[ig];B[ki]
;W[hi];B[lj];W[lg];B[lk];W[lh]
(;B[li]C[GL: I would have been inclined towards L9. You lose some stones but get to mount a pretty strong attack in return.]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[kn]C[GL: And again I'm afraid you fix the few weaknesses White still had, and still haven't completely settled your group. Your H7ish group is also suddenly a lot weaker, as you can't escape and White threatens wF7 bG7 wH8.

GL: Yeah, correct :)];W[co];B[sf];W[fd];B[ca];W[aa]C[*** Summary ***

Well done for winning, and particularly for responding well to his many killing attempts. Without doubt the biggest issue you had was in handling your weak groups.

Single stones are fairly expendable, two or three are sacrificable for some compensation, but beyond that, the investment starts to be too heavy to lose - if you have a 10-20 stone group that isn't settled, there's nothing on the board bigger than getting it to unconditional life as soon as you can.

As you noticed yourself, most of the points he made were simply chasing you around the board. I certainly don't think you seemed to be 4 stones weaker than him :)

If you have any questions on anything else (including comments and variations that I've made), please do respond to the email, and good luck with your go!]
