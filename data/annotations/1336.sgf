AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, Thanks for reviewing this game.  I played white:  although KGS lists me as 4k, I'm not nearly that strong.  IGS has me at 8k which I think is about right.
I'd especially like comments on the opening and joseki, but would love to hear any other remarks you might have!]
;W[pp]CR[pp]C[Ash [4k?\]: hi];B[dc]CR[dc]C[Ash [4k?\]: I tink 2 handis too muc...]
;W[ce]CR[ce]C[Bazill17 [6k\]: why dou think that?
Ash [4k?\]: I'm not reall 4k.
Bazill17 [6k\]: ur not?];B[fd]CR[fd]C[Mimer:
This black move is not play very often. Black normally plays E16 to get a stronger position at the top, or makes a pincer.
White now has three basic paths to choose from.
1. Setteling his stones by attaching at C17
2. Extending along the left side.
3. Make a pincer at H17.  See variations
Ash [4k?\]: Just got lucky 1 game against a 5k.
Bazill17 [6k\]: oh :)
Bazill17 [6k\]: well it will correct ur rank if u lose
Ash [4k?\]: Well let's try anyway.]
(;W[cc]CR[cc]C[I'm not so familiar with this joseki.  I considered b17 but after b c18 it seems black has gained in influence.

What's a common continuation?

Mimer:
Attaching at C17 is joseki and a good choice in this situation. To avoid this white move is one of the main reasons for black to play E16 instead of F16.   If you go back a move you can see some of the other variations.]
;B[cb]CR[cb];W[dd]CR[dd]C[Bazill17 [6k\]: im not really 6k
Bazill17 [6k\]: more like 7 or 8];B[ec]CR[ec];W[dg]CR[dg]C[This was actually a mouso: Imeant to do d12.

Mimer:
D12 isn't much better. In this situation B17 is the only move. It gives white a very solid shape in the corner.]
;B[bc]CR[bc]C[malaclypse [?\]: hi baz

Mimer:

Black immediatly punish white's mistake.];W[cd]CR[cd];B[id]
CR[id]C[Seems like both groups stable but black ended up with the corner.

Mimer:
The white group isn't stable yet. If black plays C11 it will be under attack. White has to play C9 to protect it.]
;W[cn]CR[cn]C[Mimer:
Now black has the chance to pincer white at either C8 or C11.]

(;B[fp]CR[fp];W[dk]CR[dk]C[Mimer:

Good. Now white is stable on the left side.];B[cm]CR[cm]C[I was surprised by this move.  What's a good way to handle it?
If you have any insights on the ensuing fight please share -- my reading skills aren't great.

Mimer:
Very strange move. It would be better for black to play R6 or Q10 on the right side.]
;W[dm]CR[dm]C[Mimer:

Good move. Taking control over the black stone.];B[cl]CR[cl]
C[Mimer:

In a figth it is always important to stay connected.
In this case playing D8.]
(;W[ck]CR[ck]C[Mimer: Leaving black the option to cut at D8 is dangerous.]
;B[bn]CR[bn];W[bo]CR[bo];B[dn]CR[dn];W[co]CR[co];B[dl]CR[dl]

(;W[cq]CR[cq]C[I was wondering between e7 & c3 here.

Mimer:
You shoul never allow your opponet to get a ponnuki in the center. So E7 is the only move. Go back to see the variation.]
;B[em]CR[em];W[dq]CR[dq]C[Mimer:  The normal move is E2.];B[eq]
CR[eq];W[nc]CR[nc]C[Is this wrong direction?  MAybe a pincer at m17 would hurt me?
If so, what are more useful areas to target?  Maybe extend to near k3?

Mimer:
When looking for the best direction to play try to look after the open areas.
In this case the rigth or bottom side.
Since black is very strong at the bottom I would probaly play R14.]
;B[pf]CR[pf]C[Mimer:

Black let white settle easy.  W Q18, BR17 and W L17];W[kd]CR[kd]
;B[jc]CR[jc];W[kc]CR[kc];B[nq]CR[nq]C[Mimer:
Black should play P17 before playing at the lower side.];W[qm]
CR[qm]C[Should I have pincered instead?  Black has big influence in lower region but I'm also behind on territory.

Mimer:  Making a pincer would not be good since the fight would be too easy for black to handle.]
;B[pr]CR[pr];W[qq]CR[qq];B[kq]CR[kq]C[Mimer:
Allthough this move is joseki it is not good in this situation. Black has a very strong position on the bottom left and should use it. One way could be by playing M4 instead of L3.
Anyway white now has a difficult descion to make.
Should he reduce black's left side or build some territorie on the right. Se the variation for some examples of what could happen.]

(;W[pj]CR[pj]C[This wasn't crucial.  Any recommendations for a big move?
Black bottom is looking big so maybe o5 immediately, any others?

Mimer: see previous comments.];B[qi]CR[qi];W[qj]CR[qj];B[ek]
CR[ek]C[Mimer:  E9 is not important rigth now.
With the Q10 stone in place white can easy reduce black's lower side.]

White should take this opportunity and fight back with either M7 or N7]
;W[gl]CR[gl];B[gm]CR[gm];W[mm]CR[mm]C[This was more-or-less a "feeling" move, I had no idea how things would turn out.
Could you suggest an alternate move to play at this stage?
Again, I'd be glad to hear variations, etc. on the ensuing battle.

(;W[mj]CR[mj]C[Mimer:
This looks like a strong move, but black has a good counter move.]

(;B[ll]CR[ll];W[ok]CR[ok]C[White has to continue the fight with L7]
;B[km]CR[km];W[kl]CR[kl]C[Mimer:

Mimer:
Actualy you don't have to worry about it.
If black play F11 to capture the 4 white stone it's only a gain of about 10 points using 2 moves.
Playing in the upper rigtht corner is worth more than 3 times as much.]
