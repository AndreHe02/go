C[Hi my name is Slawek Piela. I come from Poland and will be doig a review of your game.
I assume you played W.

I am only  about 11k* at IGS so please do not take everything I write on faith.   My pointers will be general. IIIf you need some more specifics mail me.

I hope my reveiew will be helpful.];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp]
;B[oc];W[dj]MA[de][pj]C[I would have played D15 or Q10

If you wanted to build framework Q10 would be better (more efficient): it faces B shimari.

It is better for B it extend in front of shimari instead of the side hence W should take the more valuable point for B.]
;B[ce];W[cg];B[qj];W[qm]LB[de:a][pj:b][jc:c]C[Now you shoul be able to see the reaso to play either kakari at D15 (a) or extention on the L side (b):

B has enclosed two corners, made an ideal extention from his BL shimari and has a chance now to link his shimaris with an ideal play at 'c' - it would be an exteniton from two shimaris - it is like getting one free play.]
;B[qq]C[Premature];W[qp]MA[pq][po][qo][or]LB[jq:a]C[It would hvae been much better to block from the other side.

I know that the proverb says to block on the side of an extention but after walling W off with moves marked "x" you could get a nice framework after 'a']
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[nq];W[op];B[mr];W[pr];B[ns];W[qr]
C[Now you have 12 points in the corner and the side and B has a perfect formation  (ponnuki) from which to extend safely inside your sfere of influence]
;B[fq];W[dm]LB[hq:a]C[How about pincer at 'a'?];B[fo];W[do]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[br]C[I think this could have been left till the endgame. It looks too small at the moment]
;B[dq];W[bp];B[ep];W[jp]LB[lq:a]C[There is also possibility to pick a fight at 'a' and establish a base on the upper side for yourself]
;B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[jq];W[kp];B[kq];W[kn]
;B[ip];W[jn]TR[jp][kp]C[Good but you might also try to sacriface the two stones and wall B off]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[io];W[jd]MA[qh][ic][pd]C[Difficult choice to make.

I do not question your choice but please consider also other marked points]
;B[jc]LB[qh:a][pi:b]C[In the variations there are other propositions.

Also consider invasion at 'a' or reducing at 'b'

W 'b' is risky but in this situation ....]

;W[bg];B[af];W[ag];B[ae]C[This sequence cost you the game:
B is absolutely happy with his big and secure corner beautyful moyo on the left

W invested 17 stones to surroud 12 point and capture 2 stones and all that in gote]
;W[eg];B[hh];W[fm]MA[qh][pd][pi]C[You are not protecting any territory this way you still can try other moves]
;B[qg]C[There it goes ! :(];W[jj]MA[jg][pd][oi]C[At this point I would take all the risks and invade deep-deep.]
;B[li];W[jh]C[Ok];B[kg];W[lk];B[nk];W[nl]LB[mj:a]C[Too submissive. You are getting a little B is solidyfing his huge territory.

Shoud have been 'a' or some such move.];B[pk];W[pl]C[As before]
;B[mk];W[ml];B[ol];W[om];B[ok];W[lj];B[mj];W[ki];B[lh];W[jg]
;B[jf];W[kd];B[ld];W[kh];B[lf];W[jb]LB[la:a]C[Should have been monkey's jump at 'a'.

There is no way B can cut off this stone - it is a good tesuji to remember.]

;W[ia];B[hn];W[fl];C[Well: You let B have huge territory and then you did not do much about it.

Try estimating the situation every once in a while and then play accordingly: you are behind take appropriate risk you are ahead calm tings down.

I dont think you need to worry about strategy at this point just try to plan ahead a little so that you know what you want to achieve and when thing are going bad just as they started go go at move 65 just leave them and do not make things worse.

Going through lost of problems and studing tesuji could help you a lot. Monkeys jump would be at least 10 points.



Meet me at IGS.

Wish you best luck
