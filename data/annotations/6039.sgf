AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Pimenta [8k?\]: Hi. Thank you for reviewing my game.
Pimenta [8k?\]: This was a very belic game, with large semeais and ko fights. I think my opponent was unreasonably aggressive in some occasions, and I am usually able to get something in return. I feel I would have won the game if I had answered the large ko threat at move 255.

Llywelyn: Interesting game.  I hope you find my review useful.  Let me know if you have any questions. 

Some key points:

* Don't try to be fancy.  Maek/Tesuji are only such if you can read out how they work. For most of your plays try to focus on good shape and simple answers.

Firmly connecting against the potential cut or the peep.  Extending or connecting to get out of the atari.  Moving out toward the center.  These may not be correct, but they should be the first moves you should consider and should have a good reason for dismissing them.

In-game examples where this cost B are moves 30, 32, 44, and 64.  

* Be willing to sacrifice or give up stones (not just a stone, but groups of them).  In several cases Black's unwillingness to let go of small groups of stones ended up costing him, as he made the groups bigger and bigger and harder to manage.  

* Study shape.  Going back to the first point: there are several instances throughout the game where B's shape gets him into trouble.   Study what makes good shape, what makes bad shape, and strive to incorporate it into your game.]
;W[dd];B[dg]TR[fc][fd][cf][df]SQ[pj][jp]C[Llywelyn: The light move here is attempting to avoid conflict, but there is no reason to avoid conflict in a 3H game.  Show more Rawr(tm) and go after her.  The triangled moves show my choices. 

If you are going to play in a defensive manner, then make it so that White should fear to approach for what you will get.  I like the squares for this.]
;W[qf];B[mc]TR[qh]SQ[nd][pj]C[Llywelyn: Black's direction is good since the north is very valuable, but this is too loose.

The variations from N17 can get fairly complex, and it only provides a better than even result if the situation favors it or if W doesn't know how to play off of it.

The loose move also doesn't put as much pressure W and makes the kick at R15 less effective if W chooses to tenuki. 

Instead, I would play any of the marked moves (the squares are more influence-oriented, the triangle is more attack oriented). O16 makes the north side valuable and works well off of D13, but gives W a hard time in th east. 

O17 catches my eye as well, but lowers the value of the north side (which could be desirable).  Given B's high play at D13, I'm assuming B wants to go for influence whereas O17 is more territorial.

I also like R12: Q10 plays more off of Q4, while R12 puts more pressure on W and provides a little more support for Q16.]
;W[np]
(;B[fc]LB[fd:B][pn:A]TR[qf]SQ[mc][dg]C[Llywelyn: Black's choice to tenuki here is interesting.  

There are several things to consider here. 

First. White's R14 is looking rather lonely.   N17 didn't put as much pressure as it could have, but some pressure on it would not go amiss here.

Second, N17 is low.  This isn't bad, its just something to take note of in relation to any plays on D16.

D13 is a light play and is unlikely to be pincered. W's typical followup to D13 is to play F16, which is rendered less valuable because of N17.

Finally, the "widest sides" on this board appear to be the east and the south, but the difference is fairly small when all is said and done. 

If I were going to play locally, I would play at A (see variation).

If I were going to tenuki, I like B.  It works well with N17 (mixing high plays and low plays), puts pressure on W by playing right where she wants to play, and gives her less wiggle room later on.]

(;B[id]LB[jc:A][qd:B][cm:D][pn:C]C[Pimenta [8k?\]: Do you think This was a fair trade in the corner?

Llywelyn: If B had played C17 instead of D17 it would look a lot better.  As it is, I think W got too much out of the exchange. 

 I am also uncertain about J16, which is a contact play: I would try the approach at K17 and take away W's base rather than try to press W down here. 

The moves that catch my eye here are:

A - A good local play that accomplishes what J16 is aiming at.  See the variation. 

B - A solid play that helps clear up the corner and force W to extend.

C - Provides protection from O4 and helps threaten R14.

D - Puts a check on W's influence while expanding B's corner.]

;W[nf]
(;B[of]C[Pimenta [8k?\]: Was there a better answer?

Llywelyn: Securely playing at O15 would probably be the best answer for Black.   P14 makes W thick, it risks the cut at O15, and it tries to gain territory directly from thickness (which is generally a bad idea).]

(;B[qk];W[nh];B[kq]C[Llywelyn: This stone doesn't have a good relationship to anything else.  It doesn't feel like an effective pincer (e.g., M3 or M4), it doesn't feel like it helps Q4 (e.g., Q6) and it is too far away to hep D4 (e.g., F4 or F3 or even K4).

Meanwhile W can cut off B at any time and start a ko at O15.]

Llywelyn: When it was just the P10 group it was worth 10 points and a little influence, and saving it  in most cases is gote (rule of thumb: you will almost always either live in gote or die in sente; there are exceptions, of course, but if you are wondering what the outcome of a particular invasion or attack will be be its a good rule of thumb).

Getting the endgame at B18 was about the same value, and there were plenty of moves on the board that were more valuable.
