this game. Even though I end up ahead I feel that I could have done much better but when reviewing the game I cannot see how! I hope that your review comments will  move me in the right direction.  Thanks again.

No, i think this is better as shown in the variation. However, you can now perhaps see that R14 seems tight. this stone would be better placed at either Q14 or R13.]

OK. After the conclusion of a big battle like this, (white's invasion of the black corner), you must puse and appraise the situation. (by the way, pardon my going on as follows, as it is certainly possible that you took what follows into account before making your next move :)

I don't know if you are in the habit of counting, but if not, you must start. Let's see how things stand:]

;TR[lc]C[For white, he may capture the marked stone at M18 which would be huge.

He may expand on the lower side.

ANd most important, he may be able to attack the black group in the upper right.]
;TR[di][dj][cl][dl][el][kc][kd][ld][ne][nc][pb]MA[jq]C[For black, two possibilities exist.

First, he may be able to attack either of the two marked white groups. Either of these attacks could substantially increase black's territory in the upper left center.

Second, black could invade the lower side around X.];C[So now, what should black do?

First I think he must consider the safety of his upper right corner.]
