C[Thanks for reviewing our game!

Ben is White

Chris is Black

xxc : i'll do the review going on with the game and discover it stone by stone ... enjoy :)
i follow the main game and point var like that in comment ... (36v1) = stone 36 var 1 ... hope it's easier to follow.
also use short for side, up, left, ... UL = upper left corner ... LS = lower side (center) and so on ...]
;B[dp]C[xxc : q16 ... but not so important];W[qd];B[dc];W[qo]
C[xxc : can't say for this one ... the only thing i know it's that it may leads difficult path ... and ...
i do not like this move, sort of bad feeling i can't explain.
second move on the 3rd line RS, and ... not well balanced ! 2 W stones seems too near

but it's not so important right now]
(;B[jc]TR[jp][op][pq]C[xxc : seems biger LS];W[jp]C[xxc : looks better now for W :)]
;B[od]C[Chris:  I decided to approach at this point.  My other option was to play d10, but I saw that Ben would probably play around R10.  I wanted to take the fight to white and strike first.

xxc : it's ok ... but if you whant that ... perhaps start with this one (5V1)]

(;W[pc]SQ[ci][di][qi][qj]C[Chris:  I was glad Ben decided to play for the corner rather than the side.  I decided that I would let him have it and try to build outside influence for myself.

xxc : mmm ... perhaps B can also tenuki and take advance elsewhere ... it may be miai (equal) one for B, one for W ... LS bigger i think :)

it's not the good way for white ... seems better towards BR stone (7v1)]
;B[oc]
(;W[qj]C[Chris:  This looked like a loose enough move to allow me to invade.

xxc : you are right, but not now ... LS is the place to play now for rather peacefull game ... or LR for fight
US is already strong ... invading now can lead to weak this side ... better to expend it latter and then threat to invade ... i think :)

perhaps you do not speak of invasion ... but just threat the W corner ... let's see :)]
;B[qf]C[Ben: I think the last 3 moves by black was a good approach by chris.  He let me live in the corner, but it is rather small and the group is isolated.

xxc : right :) R10 is too far form R16 :(     (9v1)

now it is difficult ... and W will spend moves to live ... the only way i think is getting out at Q16, but it's hard to read it out !
W may be ok to let the corner ... take RS in big way and threaten to invade US
really not easy to play :)];W[eq]C[xxc : mmm one move to far (R10) ... and this one is too near :(

it's a choice ... but i do not think W can let UR]
(;B[np]C[Chris:  I approached from too far here.

xxc : mmm ... B&W let to much for later !

here B let D4 alone, it may be dangerous ... i think B can choose a simplest way here and strenghten D4]
;W[pq]C[Chris:  I now understand the advice "If your opponent plays on the 3-5 point, take the 3-4 point".

xxc : :)
just push B outside ... and then strenghten both side];B[on]
;W[ce]C[xxc : an other unfinished patern :(

W have to put presure on this B BR floating group ... now B can attack R10 and then the UR

try to see where your moves leads ... C15 can't be sente here, B can answer and put presure on this stone ... (17v1)]

(;B[cd];W[ch]C[xxc : i do not think it's a good idea to let C15]
;B[ck]C[xxc : too far :(]
(;W[cq]C[Ben: should i have extended one more stone to C10 instead of playing here? (see variation)

Chris:  This looked to me as if I had peeped and the peep had gone unanswered.  I decided to push and start a fight.]
;B[dq]
(;W[cp]C[Ben: i think D2 would have been better.  It was probably silly of me to go for the corner. (see variation)

Chris:  I was surprised by this, D2 would have let Ben connect underneath.]
;B[dr]C[Chris: This turned one group into two.];W[ep]C[xxc : this one have nothing to do with the corner ... W have to choose ...]
;B[do];W[co];B[cn]
(;W[cr]
(;B[bo]C[Chris:  My goal was to turn this into a rectangle six or bulky five.]
;W[bp];B[an]
(;W[ap]C[Ben: I wonder if i had played A2 instead, could i have made life?  (see variations)

Chris:  That was the vital point.];B[ar];W[br];B[aq]C[Chris:  A1 seems to be a ko that could give life. (see var.)  It might have been beneficial to play somewhere else at this point and save the potential for a ko, rather than settling the corner.

xxc : white will have to play it rather soon, else B kill, a ko with no threat (at the end of the game for exemple) ... and W is dead]

(;W[cs];B[as]C[xxc : dead A1 is the only way

look at the result
B get a strong group now facing BS and LS ... W have a weak group on each side.]
;W[bs]C[xxc : W lose a stone ... keep it for ko threat];B[ds]
C[xxc : B also lose a stone here.];W[pm]C[xxc : white should have play this right after P6

to put presure on this 2 stones, better from K4 now.];B[pn]
C[xxc : mmm ... B should strenghten his group ... while threatening BS W group
(40v1)];W[qn];B[nq];W[lq]C[Ben: I don't think this was a very good move.  What about E15, Q15, R13, M5, C10 ...

Chris:  I disagree.  This move got right in the way of my iron pillar.

xxc : W have to get space for his bottom group ... 

you found it difficult because the order of the moves is wrong.
at the begin of the game each let stones without support while it was still easy to get space for free ... now groups are all over the bord, and each one interact with the others ... giving help to one will endenger an other one, but there is no choice no]
;B[nr];W[qg];B[pg];W[qh];B[pe]C[Chris:  This looks like I backed off.  Maybe S14 would have been better now.

xxc : S14 still possible :)

here B just get a choice, give a way out for W UR at S14 but with a big counterpart ... C15 for exemple :)]
;W[rf];B[re]C[Ben: That was a good move by Chris.  I don't remember if i knew at the time i had to sacrifice my stone or not.

xxc : why ?
W have R15 no ?];W[rd];B[rg];W[rh];B[sg];W[sh]C[xxc : keep it for later S14 can still be used :)]

[ln]C[xxc : out now :)];W[lp];B[hm]TR[mm]C[chris:  I left the corner to soon.  I should have made the play at n1.

xxc : N1 ?

H11 is from the wrong side :(];W[ln]
(;B[lm]C[xxc : too late, this will end with a difficult fight ... and B can have this stone in a better way i think (75v1)]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[mo];B[ml];W[nl];B[mn]C[Ben: This corner gets real interesting.]
;W[no];B[pr]C[Ben: Ko threat / trying to make life

Chris:  n2 would have made life.  P5 might have been stronger.

xxc : no it's ok B had to extend ... no eyes with N2, N1 perhaps, but W have P2]
;W[qr];B[ps];W[ms]C[Ben: ko threat

xxc: ??? killing move no ?];B[mr];W[ns]C[Ben: I extended so that I occupied O1, a vital point for him to make life.]
;B[os];W[oq]C[Ben: This is the other vital point];B[op];W[oo]
TR[pp]C[Ben: Now i have to stop him from escaping

no need to cut ... there is no more eyes with the 2 stones]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[fd];W[om]C[xxc : it's only 2 stones :)];B[pp]

(;W[qp]C[Ben: I was very tempted to play at Q5 but i think it would have given Chris life. (see variation)

xxc : it's ok like that];B[ld]C[Ben: Now black has a very strong presence on the board.

xxc : right ...]
(;W[mm]C[xxc : only 2 stones ... and W can use this possible move to expand (102v1)]

;W[oi];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[mj]
(;B[kn]TR[cf][dk]C[Ben: Why didn't black take the stone?

Chris:  I wanted to cut off any arm white built here.  So I wasn't so concerned with the one stone.  I thought that if I pushed hard enough, I could have created a shortage of liberties.

C[Ben: I knew that this was going to be risky having a bunch of groups connected by false eyes.  I almost connected all the way to the other side though!]
;B[ei]C[Ben: I guess you have to keep more liberties at the front of your invasion than false eyes or you will have to sacrifice a group...]

Ben: Thanks for reviewing our game.  I was very dissapointed that i lost the lower left and upper left groups.  If i had kept them alive, the score would have been much closer.

Chris:  My major weakness was that I was led around the board a lot.  Also, I would start fights and then back off some.  My study of life and death really came in handy though.  Hopefully as I get stronger I can avoid groups like the bottom right.  I thought Ben had a much better sense of territory than I, and he carved himself a huge chunk of the board.  Thank you for the review.

xxc : i end the review, comments on the moves as they arise ... let it by side and cmae back to read the whole game to let you an overall comment :)

time for overall comment :)

for Ben first white here
try to take in account the whole bord ... i think you do not see relation between stones and groups
take time to look at all the board ... and play, add stones where it is needed ... thinking before what may arise 
in LL playing form both side cost you the corner ... and in the center, near the end you push from a strong group, it cost you the LS group
try also to have a look at connect/cut ... it may be usefull to know how far you can extend

for Chris now black
mmm ... not really agree with your overall comment ! about territory at least
during battle in the LR you add 2 stones on the US ... F16 and M16 2 big moves
about your comment again ... i feel you play as the whole board is yours, it's wrong thinking ... losing a part can be really interesting if you can get bigger elsewhere :)
you just failed getting out (or live) with your BR group ... but in conterpart i think you play strong and solid moves :) ... and also use thikness, even if i do not think you can understand it's effect right now (myself do not still understand it's power !)

good game, a clean game for me ... with try (it's ok to try) ... but not "push too far" when it doesn't work :(
hope comments will help you (do not forget they may be wrong ... i'm only arround 10k everywhere ! i just give you my feeling of the game)

it end's here ... thank u]N[RESULT])
