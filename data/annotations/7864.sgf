AB[pd][dp]C[Hi there! Thanks so much for this review!

I've written some question relating for specific moves. I'm also looking for general comments about my style.

Thanks again!

mlansman

Hi, 

That was a nice game of you part, don't see some big fatal mistake and more important, you both miss to kill the same corner shape, so I will try to answer your questions and point some move that can be optimized elsewhere. My go is not so strong (I'm only 3k) and my English maybe worse (I'm just a French after all^^) so please excuse the errors that may fill this review.

Have fun :)

PS : I will start my comments by \\m/];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc];B[df]
;W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[cj]C[\\m/ : Joseki... white is low and you build a good board. So far so good ;)]
;W[fq]
(;B[cq]SQ[cm][dm][cn][dn]C[I did this because I thought it would be heavy to play in the squared area, and wanted to defend the corner while still putting a bit of pressure on F3. It was an unusual move for me though.

-Is there anything better I could have done?
-Would a pincer have been better?

\\m/ : See vars.];W[cn]C[He went in anyway, but I didn't mind as I thought it was a pretty bad move. I decided to try and push his two weak groups together and cut them (I cut on move 14). I felt good at this point, and when I cut. However, eventually he reconnected (move 35), and ultimately he got more than me in this quaderant.

-Was this push together and cut stratergy the right thing to do?
-If not, what else could I have done?
-If it was the right stratergy, what did I do wrong?

\\m/ : cut right now, white will have a hard fight to deal with. The pincer stone h4 was just creating a weak group (See vars)]
(;B[hp];W[fo]
(;B[eo]C[So this was the cut.];W[gp]C[This threw me a bit. Didn't want to know how to keep H4 alive while maintaining sente...]
(;B[np]C[...in the end I went for an avalanche.

-Was this the right thing to do?

\\m/ : don't know the hoshi high approach well, w can tenuki here and keep an nice position, h5 looks urgent]
(;W[pn];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq]
(;W[qp];B[kq];W[ho]C[Good move on whites part.

\\m/ : yes, wouldn't be so good without h4 before the cut ;)]
;B[ip];W[en]
(;B[dn]C[I played this move irrationally. I was a bit tunnel vision about splitting the two white groups up.

-Should I have done something else here?];W[dm];B[do];W[cm]
(;B[fn]C[Again, tunnel visioning.];W[em];B[gn];W[go];B[in];W[hn]
C[So this is when he reconnected.];B[qi]C[Biggest move?

\\m/ : hard to answer that, more over your cutting stones in f6 are key stones so trying to get them out can't be bad. For once, empty triangle is not a bad play.]
;W[qk]TR[nc][oi]C[\\m/ : one of the two marked points would be my choice]
;B[qf];W[io];B[jo];W[gm]C[I thought this was a very heavy move...

\\m/ : Now you have no target to attack]
(;B[mc]C[...giving me a double wing...

\\m/ : you can go all the way to l17];W[nc]C[...but I didn't ecpect this.

-Was this extension too long? Should I have gone for O17?

\\m/ : your extension was in fact too near, l17 would put pressure on f17 group. But if you wanted a secured corner, the point was p17]
(;B[nd]C[-Was this the right response to O17?

\\m/ : see variation];W[qc];B[qd]C[-Was this right, or should I have gone for Q17?]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]
(;W[pa]
(;B[pj]C[-Biggest move?

\\m/ : No, even localy q9 is bigger. C18 is huge too, killing the s18 corner not so small (see var.) or in the same moyo building idea, e10 is bigger]
;W[pk];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[ra]C[-Did he need to do this?

\\m/ : see previous variations];B[ec]CR[lf][mf][nf][kg][lg]
[mg][ng][kh][lh][mh][nh][ki][li][mi]TR[ok]SQ[ie]C[My plan was for this to be the start of a leaning attack around the squared space. I was then going to follow up with an attack around the triangled space, hoping to secure the circled territory.

The leaning attack didn't really work.

-Was my overall stratergy a good one?
-If so, how could I have made the attack on the left side more effective?

\\m/ : What you have right is that the only group that can be attack is the f17 one. Don't underestimate c18 here, it's the biggest local move and white risks to end with a dumb shape if he doesn't answer it.
after w secured his group by answering your moves around e17, turning to j15 would end in gote, so with his position into the LL and LR, he can easily reduce your center territory. So just c18 and turning to j15 looks better for b here.

About j9, in this position o10 looks safer than the hane];W[eb]
;B[fd];W[dc];B[ed];W[gc];B[ok]TR[ic][id]SQ[ie]C[I felt that a play on the squared space wouldn't put enough presure on the triangled group to be in sente, and that white would play on P9. So I went for P9 myself.

-Was this assesment correct?
\\m/ : yes, already explained why
-If it was, was my response correct?
\\m/ : already answered it too.];W[dr]C[I don't think I dealt with this attack very well, though I did finish with sente (it ends on move 85).

-Is there anything I could have done differently?
\\m/ : I would answer c2 as well];B[cr];W[dq];B[er]C[I regretted this.

\\m/ : Keep it for yose];W[eq]
(;B[co]C[And this...];W[bo]C[...because it was so obvious that it would lead to this eye stealer.

-What could I have done differently?];B[bp];W[ep];B[cp]
(;W[ao];B[ap];W[bn];B[br];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds]C[End of white's atteck on the right hand corner. I guess he didn't really have to do this, and thus it was a bad gote mistake.

\\m/ : True];B[rj]TR[pk][qk]SQ[ok]C[This was bad. It strengthened the triangled group (see move, and meant that my attack from the squared stone was much less effective.

\\m/ : protecting in e10 is big and neutralize white thickness]
;W[rk];B[sk];W[sl];B[sj];W[rl];B[nk]TR[oj]SQ[ol]C[This was bad as well. Very slow. I was angry that I have made the S10 mistake, thought that I couldn't mount an effective attack on the squared space, and feared a cut at the triangled space. I considered P6, but regected it in the end.

-What would have been better.

\\m/ : connecting with p9 is avoiding a lot of problems];W[jp]
;B[kp];W[jn];B[ko];W[im];B[fl]C[I was at a lost as to what to do at this point. The plan was to  reduce some of the triangled walls power, then block up the squared area, hopefully making some territory in the circled area.

-Was this a good plan?
-If not, what else could I have done?
-If so, what did I do wrong? Should I have started at the other end? (I didn't because I feared I'd lose sente.)]
;W[fm];B[ek];W[hf]C[So my plan failed pretty badly!

\\m/ : It was a good plan, but don't focuse on the o13 area.]
(;B[ie]C[\\m/ : don't push in a keima if it's not for cutting]
;W[he];B[gd];W[hd]C[That exchange was pointless...

\\m/ : True, just free reinforcement for w];B[jg]C[But I thought this one worked out well for me]
;W[ch];B[eh];W[li]TR[ji][kk][lk]C[I'm very bad at anticipating, preventing, and defending against these kinds of moves.

I'd be really greatful if you could give me some general tips about them.

\\m/ : kosumi and contact moves are often defensive moves. Better to chose a keima or a tobi to attack.]

Thanks again for the review!

Hard to judge on style qith just one game. You largely won it. You missed two tsumego based on the same classic corner shape so somme life and death exercises won't be bad.

Hope this review would be hopefull, you can find me on KGS under KaiHansen if you have questions.

Good continuation,
