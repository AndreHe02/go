C[This game is between me (slade[white\]) and Ranut who is black.

In
this game I get pushed around by black's overly aggressive style of
playing. What i would like to know is a way to defend against this kind
of playing. So any notes on how to make his attacks seem futile would
be nice to see :)

Thanks in
advance!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj]LB[pj:A]C[Insteresting Fuseki,
People that play like this often enough are very strong at fighting, so
if you allow him to take the "A" spot you will have a lot of trouble
invading (remember, he is strong at fighting!) So it´s best not to
allow him to finish his san-ren-sei!];W[nd];B[pf];W[kd];B[pi]
TR[kd][nd]C[And he finished it! now you will have problems in invading!

Generally
speaking, the two marked white stones are too far away, because thei
are at the 4th line, to have a stable two point extension it should be
at the 3rd line.];W[pm]C[Yes I agree, you have to invade!];B[fc]
;W[qk]LB[ec:D][hc:A][ic:B][fd:C][df:E]C[I know this move is bad...now that i look at the game something like h17 would be better?


     You are right! It´s a bad move, not because of the move in itself, but to answer in the top is much more important!
Anything like "A", "B", "C", "D" or even "E" would be apropriate!]
;B[ic]C[See, on the 3rd line, the two point extension is very stable]
;W[ie];B[cf];W[cd]LB[cc:A][ee:B][df:C]C[I
don´t understand this move, this is suposed to defend the corner, but
you don´t have any territory at the corner, so what are you going to
defend? I prefer at "A", "B" or "C"];B[ci]C[He like´s this two point extension doesn´t he? How about an invasion at R3 now? See Variation]

(;W[fe]C[I
don´t think this was necessary, becasue your 2 stones can live with
ease, or the can escape to the centre quite quickly, so I prefer to
play elsewhere];B[db]LB[dg:C][ck:B][cl:A]C[My plan here was to start building strength and push down on black but it didn't work.

Well, you have to play "A" or "B" then you can plan to play "C" afterwards]
;W[cl]C[Nice move];B[bc];W[bd]LB[df:A][jp:C][qq:B]C[Why? I don´t understand this move, it is too small!

Well you have "A", "B" or "C" which are very Big!];B[cc];W[np]
LB[fe:A]TR[bd][cd][dd]C[maybe f12 is better? or som sort of approach move on the c11 and c14 stones?

I prefer D13

Well,
the 3 white marked stones are not connected to the "A" stone yet, can
you see this? BUT It could help you to leave it like this!

YES, you can take advantage if he tryies to cut, take a look at the variation]

seem to do okay in this exchange  but i get a weak group. luckily i can
still run out into the  center.

Yes, it tourned out to be allright, but you can capture the cutting stone like the variation]

C[Nice reply];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq]
(;W[bm]C[seeing what black does later to my corner i think b2 would be a better move. What do you think?

NO, B2 is not good, better at C2 or even J4, see variations]
;B[eq]C[humm....];W[ep];B[cr];W[dq]C[perhaps f3 was better than this move?

No, it´s OK!];B[dr]
(;W[hq]C[Now
this is wrong! You can try to defend the Territory at the side with F3
or start a fierce fight with E3, see variations];B[gr];W[fq]

;B[bk]C[Well,
as you can see balck is ahead in territory, so you have to reduce his
territory, you can start at S11, then go to R17 or even A13, but you
cannot allow your opponent get anymore territory.


You can get territory playing N9 also!];W[ck];B[cj];W[bo];B[cp]
;W[rh]C[overplay?? or not that big/important? maybe someething like n10?

Well, too long! Should have played at S11];B[ri]C[what happens here is just plain stuipdity on my part.]

So far so good, you have good possibility to win, but you have to get
territory in the middle, N9 now is a very strong move!];W[kb]
;B[ob];W[fi]C[NICE MOVE!];B[of];W[nf];B[od];W[ne];B[fg]C[possible black overplay? 

Yes it is an over play!

Do you know why he played at F13? Because he thinks your territory is too big, so he is trying to recude your territory!]

(;W[dg]C[here
i think that f13 is an overplay but i just didn't know how to punish
it. Is the black move at f13 an overplay and if so how would i go about
punishing it?

Well how about H12? See variation];B[df];W[ef];B[eg];W[eh]C[maybe d12 is better? Yes, D12 would have been better!]
;B[dh];W[di];B[cg]C[Well now you should really play at H12]
;W[dj];B[hg]C[do you know why he is playing at H13 now? Because he wants to rescue his center stone]

this? my guess is g15 which i was debating playing during the game.

How
about L13?];W[ee];B[hf];W[ge]C[Not playing g15 seems to haunt me

Your major mistake was the D13 move instead of the H12.

To improve I would advice you to:

1º
Improve your positional judgement, if you noticed that you were ahead
in the middle of the game you would notice that it would be ovrplay in
D13, and would just defend at H12.

2º Take more time reading your sequence, remenber the group at T11? It osted you 20 points or more!

3º
You want to improve? Well you can improve your fuseki by taking a look
at the "Modern Oppening Theory Made Easy" - It´s a book from the Ishi
Press. Another book that can help your fighting techniques is TESUJI -
From the Elementary Go Series - also from the Ishi Press.

4º
The GTL has a vey big archive of reviwed games, why don´t you have a
look at the one´s reviewed by 4 Kyu´s? That is how stronger players
improve, by reviewing professional games, so if it works for them it
should work for us (it is already working for me!). Try to review a
game or per day, after the 10th game, you will notice the diference in
your playing style!.

Have Fun])
