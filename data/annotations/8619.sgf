--------------------------
TM - Hello, I'm MrMoto on KGS; I have reviewed mostly for White. My main advice for White is to keep up the attack on a weak group while it is still weak. In the game, there was an easy target (Black's three stones in the top right) that was left alone for most of the game, while instead White allowed an invasion into the left side and chased around an unkillable group.

You (White) asked specifically about the ko in the bottom right corner (move 48), and the attack later in the game which ended with White closing off Black's group at move 146. In both cases, there were more important options available -- White should have been claiming open territory, or expanding his moyo, or chasing a weak group instead. Please see the comments in the game for more details.

Ciao,
Tim];B[pq];W[pd];B[dc];W[dp]C[this starting is unusual, was be wrong?

TM - This looks good.];B[qf];W[nc];B[cn];W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[do];B[bn];W[em];B[iq]C[TM - Perhaps too close to White's wall without additional support from the lower right. White can consider a pincer at L3 when convenient.]
;W[de]C[TM - Good.];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[fc];W[io]C[TM - This is much too close to your wall. A move like this might be helpful if you were building a centre moyo and needed more influence. But since you don't seem to be aiming at that, and since the bottom side is still rather open, I think it would be much better to try to separate Black's two stones.]
;B[kp];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[ip];W[ho]C[TM - The natural result of J5 is that White has ended up overconcentrated. Black can be satisfied with the result.]
;B[jo];W[pj]C[TM - Good. K5 was slow; Black should have taken Q10 first.]
;B[pn]
(;W[pg]C[TM - Consider R15 instead (see variation).];B[pf];W[qg]
C[TM - Hitting the two stones on the head at P14 looks more severe. It would also work well with the moyo that you're building on the left.]
;B[of];W[qm]C[TM - Since this strengthens Black, perhaps just R8 is enough.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[on];W[mn]LB[qd:A][rd:B]TR[of][pf][qf]C[TM - White could instead keep up the attack on the R14 stones. These three stones are heavy and White can make territory along the top while harassing them: this could start with White blocking off the corner at A or B.]
;B[mm]LB[rd:B][og:A]C[TM - Black, on the other hand, should consider turning at A or sliding into the corner at B. It's important to make sure that these three stones don't get restricted.]
;W[lm];B[mo];W[lo];B[nn];W[ln];B[lp];W[qq]C[this is oberplay i think. but the ko was real avoidable?

TM - Yes, this is an overplay; it's better left as a ko threat. There are more reasonable alternatives, such as developing the left-side moyo, or chasing the three black stones.]
;B[qr]LB[pr:A]C[TM - Black could just play at A.];W[pr];B[or]
;W[rr];B[ps];W[rp]
(;B[qp]C[TM - Black can just block instead (see variation).]
;W[rn]LB[ro:A]C[TM - Black should consider A next. Otherwise, if he just captures at S3, then White could take A and be satisfied with a moderate reduction of the corner.]
;B[rq];W[sq];B[ro];W[so];B[sp];W[co];B[bo];W[rp]
(;B[qq]LB[ef:A][og:B]C[TM - Filling in here lacks spirit! Black let you off easy. The peep at A or the cap at B, for example, would have been reasonable threats. But even if he didn't want to risk these moves, he should have filled in at R5 instead: see variation.]
;W[qo]C[TM - It is painful for Black to have permitted this move. Still, he could have ignored it to play (e.g.) P13. It seems that both players lost perspective here in the corner.]
;B[po];W[ro];B[ol];W[pk];B[jm];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[cj]C[TM - It is probably wiser for Black to deal with the three stones than to start an invasion.]
(;W[gr]LB[ck:A]C[TM - Very slow. White should not allow Black to play C10 without suffering the consequences. Consider playing at A. Alternatively, attack the three stones: see variation.]
;B[rd]C[TM - It will now be much more difficult for White to attack these stones.]
;W[qc];B[rc]C[here i think was make l17 immediatly

TM - Yes, White could consider L17 now.];W[rb];B[qd];W[pc];B[sb]
;W[kc];B[qb]C[TM - This is very nice for Black.];W[pb];B[ra]
;W[di]LB[ck:B][bl:A][cr:C]C[TM - This allows Black to do too much damage: he could easily wreak havoc by playing at A. To keep C10 separated from the corner stones, consider a move like B instead. You could then follow up at C to restrict Black's space in the corner.]
;B[dj];W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[dl];W[ci];B[bj];W[fk];B[el];W[dm]
;B[fl];W[cm];B[fm];W[fn];B[hm];W[gn];B[hl];W[nj];B[jk];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[nm];B[om];W[jn];B[in];W[kn];B[hj];W[gi]LB[hc:A][ic:B]
C[TM - Playing at A/B is big for both players.];B[ji];W[ck]
;B[dk];W[gk]C[TM - White is bent on attacking a group that will be hard to kill. (Why not earlier attack the three black stones with the same intensity? They would have made an easier target.) White should consider H17 instead.]
;B[hk];W[kj];B[hi];W[hh];B[ih];W[hg];B[lh];W[jj];B[ij];W[ng]
;B[og];W[oh];B[rf];W[rh];B[ic]C[TM - Good.];W[jf];B[ig];W[if]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[hn];W[il];B[hp];W[go];B[ak];W[ki]C[this is really decisive?

TM - No. White was playing too aggressively here, and doesn't have much to show for the attack. In the meantime, Black was able to take J17.]
;B[mf];W[mg];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[lf]LB[nf:A]C[TM - A big mistake. Black should simply connect at A; see variation.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[oe];B[kd];W[jd];B[jc];W[ld];B[ke];W[je];B[kb]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[nd]C[TM - Is this necessary? White shouldn't have any problem living here. Playing in the lower left corner is big for both players: consider C2 instead. (Or, for a better local move, simply N18.)]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[gf];W[gg]LB[gd:C][hf:B][fg:A]C[TM - Awkward! What about jumping out at A, keeping things simple by connecting at B, or, if you feel you need to complicate things, attacking around C?]
(;B[ff]LB[ef:A][fg:B]C[TM - It is surely better for Black to peep at A here, then continue with B to punish White's bad shape.]
;W[fg]C[TM - Black played clumsily and helped White to fix the empty triangle.]
;B[ef];W[df];B[eg];W[eh];B[cr];W[dd];B[ed]C[TM - C17 instead would simplify matters in the corner.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[ec];W[bf];B[bd];W[gd];B[fe]
C[TM - Terrible shape! Just G17.]
(;W[hd]C[TM - This feels too passive. Since Black didn't defend the edge with his last move, it would be interesting to try to punish him for it. See variation.]

[dn:B][gp:A]C[TM - There are much bigger endgame moves: A, B, C.]
;W[pe]C[TM - Good. White seems more focused than Black in the endgame. End of comments.]

(;B[nf]C[TM - This makes a great difference. White cannot count this area as territory now (compare to the final territory in the real game). Also, this is sente because White cannot allow Black to play M13.

This is why L11 isn't as decisive as you might have thought.]
