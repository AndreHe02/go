C[Hello!  Thank you for reviewing my game.

Rev: Sorry it took so long!];B[jd];W[dk];B[di];W[kj];B[kf];W[cc]
;B[hc];W[hk];B[ck];W[cl];B[bk];W[cg]SQ[ek][ce]C[By this point I thought I had a significant lead, would that be an accurate assessment?  In particular, black's upper right seems way too concentrated.

Rev: I'm not so sure.  Remember that what would be overconcentrated on a 19x19 is OK on a 13x13.  Black has about 20 certain points in the top right, with a good chance at more in the centre.  I think he might also be able to get at your bottom left corner by playing something like E3.  He also still has the ideal invasion at C9, which should get him something.]
;B[eb]C[Rev: Good extension from black's concentration of stones.]
;W[db]C[Is there a better way to answer this?  I thought about E11 or G12.

Rev:  I think this is reasonable under the circumstances, if he responds you can threaten his weak bottom left corner.]
;B[ec];W[ci]C[Rev: Good move.];B[dj];W[ek]C[Rev: This is a good response.]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[cj];W[ch];B[bl]C[Rev: Now black is clearly alive in the left bottom corner.  You have about 35 points in likely territory, and he has about the same, except that the center territory is much more likely to become black's, due to his top right corner.  You have to worry about threats to your top right, so you will have trouble gaining the advantage...]
;W[dm];B[aj];W[ce]C[This still seems favorable to me, should I have tried to kill the lower left perhaps?  Or maybe invasion at L11 instead?

Rev:  This is a definite must.  A black stone there would really ruin your day.  You cannot kill the bottom left any more, and even if there were some clever tesuji to do that, he can still run quite easily to his other stones.  I don't think that an invasion at L11 would be easy to keep alive, to say the least!  The stones at L8 and H11 are ideally placed to make trouble for a 3-3 invasion.  The big issue here remains the question of the centre territory.  As an exercise, try counting the game at this point.  Notice that you will find some territory that is yours, some that is his, and some that is undecided.  The undecided territory is big enough to win the game.]
;B[fi];W[hi]SQ[kh][gj]C[I still thought I was quite far ahead in this game at this point.

Rev: This is a good move, and puts you ahead in terms of territory on the board, but black can still grab more center territory.  Also, a move at L6 or G4 can reduce your territory effectively.]
;B[gg]SQ[jh][ee][ef][kh][lg]C[What is the proper response to this???

Rev:  Well, counting at this point, it seems that the centre territory is still the issue.  I have marked some suggestions to reduce it, or to grab other territory, but I'm not good enough to say whether they would work perfectly.]
;W[ig]C[An overplay perhaps?  I couldn't decide here between K6 and J7.]
;B[kh]C[Ouch, that hurt.

Rev:  This exchange is probably slightly in black's favour, depending on whether you succesfully nullify the centre territory with the stone at J7.]
;W[ji];B[hf];W[ee]C[Rev:  A sensible reducing move.];B[df]
(;W[cf]C[Rev:  This is a bit of a timid move, in my opinion.  You can keep him from cutting in more ways than just the block (see variation)]
;B[dd];W[de];B[ef]C[The last five moves, I thought, were in my favour, no?

Rev:  Definitely!];W[ff]C[Rev:  Good move!];B[eg];W[fg]C[I stil figured I had a sizeable lead against this guy -- I was pretty sure I'd either be able to kill the three stones in the upper left, using the exchange that happens here.  Bad sequence of moves?

Rev:  Not so bad at all, see comments.];B[eh];W[fd];B[ge];W[fc]
C[Rev:  By ignoring the cut, you exchange the two white stones in the centre for the three at the top edge.  A good trade for sure.]
;B[fe];W[fb];B[gb];W[fa]C[Rev: If you had played E13, you would definitely be able to ignore the next black move.]
;B[gd];W[ed]C[Not necessary?  I really, really wanted those stones.  :)

Rev:  One sometimes does get tunnel vision when going after stones that you want to keep, and this can be dangerous, as you lose sente this way.  As you say, this is not necessary.  If black plays E10 you can take E13, and vice versa.]
;B[lj];W[lk];B[li];W[fj]C[J6 better, maybe?  Oh, L3, probably, is what looks best to me now.

Rev:  Hindsight is 20/20.  Yes, L3 would have been better, but if you missed this, I can see that you would want to keep black from coming in near G4.  J6 I don't see as that big.]
;B[ih]C[Now J7 looks quite useless.

Rev:  Not qute useless.  I'm sure in hindsight you can see that responding here at K6 would have been better?]
;W[hh];B[jh];W[hg];B[gh];W[gi]C[Rev: should have been at J5...]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[if];W[jg];B[kk]C[Doh!  Very angry that I missed this, I think it cost me the game.  I kinda wonder why I didn't patch that up immediately after black played M4.

Rev:  This move was indeed hanging over your head for a while.]

(;W[jk]C[I think the game is lost from here on, no big points played, but of course my endgame is very novice.

Rev: Bad blunder here (see variation).  L2 is better.];B[kl]
;W[jl];B[ll];W[kg]C[Rev: Good move.];B[lg];W[jf];B[ke];W[ga]

;B[bm]
(;W[dl]C[Rev:  Ugly move.   I don't see what black could have done here. (variation)]
;B[ej];W[gj];B[ah];W[ag];B[ai];W[ie]C[Mistake, I missed the proper intersection.  How the hell did black get so big???

Rev:  see my previous comments.  It's a bind to count during the game, but it's the only way to realize whether you must attack or defend, and what the major points are.]
