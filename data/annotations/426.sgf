HA[4];W[gc];B[df];W[db];B[fg]C[Slack! This stone neither  makes territory nor puts pressure on w. It is better to stop w from taking the corner at c17. another possibility might be to  block at k17. This seems inferior, but it is also an extention from the u r corner.]
;W[cj]C[This move nullifies the influence of the three b stones in the upper left.]
;B[cm]C[good];W[cg];B[cf];W[bf];B[lc]C[This is the right area to play now, but I dont feel to good about m17. It doesnt prevent w's ideal (2-space) extention at k17, on the oter hand b's four space extention is to weak to take the corner. 017 may become the weak point later on. So I'd suggest to play either at k17 (which was better before b's upper left group became a bit weak) or to make a corner enclosure (p6 or o6) aiming at a sanrensai at the right side with q10 later. m17 is lukewarm.]
;W[jc];B[le];W[qc];B[qd]C[I would have blocked rather at q17 to make territory. It seems better to block on the side you have influence on to make territory there. Anyway, the outcome for b in this game was even better blocking on this side since you ended in sente and had time to play r11! So I might be wrong.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]C[w s16 seems better to me, it is sente and w can play here later.]
;B[rc];W[qb];B[qi]C[b gained much by this exchange. The wall works well with R11 (why not even r10? that would be also an extention from q4). So it seems to me, w invaded at R17 a bit to early.]
;W[dg];B[ff];W[je];B[di]C[nice move!];W[ci]C[.. but something like d10 should follow. now the stone is quite weak.]
;B[lq]C[see m17. I'd rather suggest k3 - this is an extention from both sides - or a tighter enclosure. m17 seems best here. playing on 4-4 (like q4) is not orientated towards corner territory, so the enclosure contradicts the spitit of playing on the star-point. Also you'd need another move to make the corner safe.]
;W[iq];B[fq];W[gq];B[ep]C[w is weak here and your corner needs no reinforcement at the moment. so better attack at g4 instead!]
;W[kp];B[kq]C[this seems a bit low to me, although it forces w. I think I would prefer m11. Let w take territory but take a larger one meanwhile!]
;W[ip];B[gn]C[if the aim was to keep w separated, a move like d10 does the job better. this seems a bit slack again.]

C[you should try to keep your stones connected. w is weak in this position and you are strong. so you should chase w's stones to build influence/territory while he has to escape. Now the situation changed and your stones are vulnerable. this makes it easy for w to escape.]

(;B[ec];W[jm];B[jg];W[nq]C[b p3 saves the corner but sacrifices 2 stones + gives w a big territory. I am not sure here, but  attacking with n6 seems better to me.

;W[kb];B[fb];W[gb];B[id]C[that's the way to do it. exploit deficits in w's shape. Your aim here should be to reduce rather than to kill.]

I am not good at invasions, but k5 seems worth trying. I think threatening to cut off the 2 stones k7/8 you'd be able to connect k5.


all in all you did quite well! a good endgame and this game would be won!]
