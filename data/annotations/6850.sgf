C[MM: GTL review by Mike Malveaux ("wegobad" on go servers), reviewing for Black, September 2008.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[jq]SQ[pk][qk]TR[pn][po][qn][qo]C[How is this opening up to 5?  Not sure about it, I just got tired of playing the same star point opening

MM: I'm not great at fuseki.  Orthodox advice would be to make a corner enclosure with R5 or another nearby point (triangles).  The Chinese Fuseki patterns are also available at Q9 or R9 (squares).

This particular move, K3, seems unusual and maybe not good.  It's not sente, and it may be cut off from the Q3 corner.  If you're willing to accept those drawbacks in exchange for some other goal, then maybe it is not bad.]
;W[qk];B[qn]TR[pq]LB[qh:B][qm:A]C[How is black 7?  I thought of going one closer at A but figured that it was too far away from the marked stone in the corner, I was hoping that white would play at B and I would get sente to play elsewhere

MM: I like the game Black 7 at R6.  With the Q3 and K3 stones, it makes a nice corner framework.  Good move.]

(;W[qp]C[So I expected white 8 at some point but not this early this doesn't seem to be the right play by white with the pushing sequence that follows I think black gains

MM: I agree, White 8 at R4 is unnecessarily aggressive and poorly timed.]
;B[pp];W[qo];B[po];W[rn];B[rm]C[I didn't think this through all the way but I figured that I could double hane]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[rl];B[ro];W[sm];B[rp]C[I like the gain I have here, but I hate losing sente, but I expect that I have a very big head start right now

MM:  All in all, I think Black is doing better so far.  The Q3-Q6 wall is very nice.  You could consider keeping sente and letting White capture the S5 stone.  At this stage, it's only worth a few points anyway.]
;W[qg]LB[qf:a][qh:b]C[This seems not to be the right spot for white I would have expected either a or b

MM: Keeping in mind that I'm poor at fuseki...  White's 20 at R13 seems to be the right distance from the R9 formation.  I think the proposed 'b' at R12 would be a little too close for good efficiency.  The suggested 'a' at R14 looks playable, and might be better than the actual move since it puts more pressure on the corner.]
;B[qe]TR[mc]LB[nc:b][nd:c][og:d][qi:a]C[I was not sure what to do here but black 21 didn't seem bad... I don't think its optimal but I just couldn't seem to find a better spot.  White still has a weakness at a that I can attack later and 21 seemed to protect the corner.  I considered b and c but they seemed too slow and left the corner open to a 3-3 invasion.  I was expecting white to extend to d and then I could extend to c

MM: 21 at R15 seems ok.  N17 (triangle) is the usual joseki response to R13; however, in this case it is complicated by the Whites around R9.  It may be best to attack at R11 ('a') right away.]

(;W[nc]TR[qg]C[Okay now I don't really like 21 as much as I did before but white seems to be playing overly aggressive so I think I should be able to capitalize on that somehow so I plan on attacking the marked stone by pushing on white 22

MM: I agree, White is playing a little too aggressively, and Black should be able to reap the benefits.  The 21 move at R15 still seems ok to me.]
;B[nd]TR[oc]C[MM:  This does not feel like the best option.  One common joseki sequence -- White N16, Black O15, etc. -- is wrong, since White is alive around R11.  Also White can still go into the corner.  If White just plays the natural move at N16, the stones make a nice long extension from the top left corner.  All in all, I think P17 defending the corner, then taking sente, would be better.]
;W[md];B[oc];W[nb];B[qi]C[Now after this attack I am not really pleased the marked stone might still escape and I don't think there is much to gain here

MM:  If I understand correctly, you think the R13 stone can escape and this R11 invasion will not help you much.  I agree, the R13 stone can escape, but this invasion is sente, and should at least bring a nice reduction.  I criticise the timing though, when there are so many large areas of the board that are still empty.]
;W[og];B[oi]C[MM: Looks good so far.];W[ne]C[I don't think I need to respond to white 30 so I decide to connect from underneath]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[qf];W[rh];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph]C[MM: Nice.];W[ri]
;B[ob]C[Not sure if I needed black 39 it was just looking a little scary in that corner and I thought that with my existing lead I could probably take the corner points and be happy

MM: I don't think this Black 39 at P18 is necessary.  I do understand you want to keep the 12 - 15 points in the corner.  But this is gote, and there are places on the board where you can get this much in sente.  Then come back later and defend.]
;W[od]C[I don't think 40 was a good move for white too small

MM:  I agree.];B[of]TR[fc][fp]C[MM: This also seems too small, when moves near F4 and F17 are available.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg]C[MM:  This cut shows good fighting spirit.  However, White will become strong all across the upper side, so maybe it is not the best move.]
;W[mh]TR[lg]C[MM: Oh!  White misses the chance to sacrifice two stones for overwhelming thickness and huge territory.  White mistake.]
;B[lg];W[nh]C[So now we have something to attack in the white stones, not sure how this will come out but I figure I must be able to get some profit here.]
;B[lh]C[MM: Good.];W[mj];B[nl]TR[fp][jo]C[I thought for a long time here and considered some other moves to try to cut the white stones or keep more pressure on them but didn't see anything definative so I went with black 51, hoping white runs to the left allowing me to attack along the way and build a large moyo along the bottom right

MM: Good thinking.  Just make sure the three cutting stones do not die!  Also, expect the White group to eventually get away.

My own approach would be less direct -- perhaps K5 or F4.];W[li]
;B[ni]C[MM:  Mistake.  White *wants* to connect, and Black gains little here.  Why force the opponent to do what he wants to do anyway?]
;W[mi];B[lf];W[me];B[ig]SQ[li][me]TR[hf][hg]MA[kd]C[was 57 to far away?

MM:  As a rule of thumb, in the center of the board, you can jump one space from one stone.  From a two-stone wall, you can jump two spaces.  From a three-stone wall, you can jump three spaces.  So, you probably could go as far as H13 or H14 (triangles) and maintain the connection.  It is confusing though because of the M11 and N15 groups (squares).  Here, I think it might be better to first go toward the edge of the board, with L16 (cross), then come back and make shape in the center of the board.]
;W[jd]TR[ii][jj]C[I liked white 58, thought it was a strong move... still think black is ahead but at this point I was a little at a loss of where to play so...

MM:  I agree, White K16 is nice.  I'm not sure Black is ahead though -- a lot of the board is still empty.  Black has a large corner and much of the lower side, plus the upper right corner which White can reduce.  White has a medium-small side group, and a territory on the upper side that is suddenly very large, plus two uncontested hoshi in the corners.  Both players have one weak group in the center of the board.  To me, it looks roughly even, maybe with more possibilites for White.

Where next?  Can there be any doubt?  Use Black's weak group to chase the White weak group.]
;B[ij]C[I tried 59 to see if I could catch the marked stones, plus I figured it was good positioning for attacking either of the two white corners in the future.

MM: Right region of the board, but I would rather see better shape -- K10 would be my choice.  Still, this is a good move!  Don't expect to catch the stones, just be happy with profit in sente.  Of course, if you do get the chance to capture them, don't hesitate!  But first make sure it's not a trap.]
;W[ml];B[mm]TR[nm]C[MM:  Hmm, considering that you would like to connect the two right corners, I think it's better to play O7 and not leave a cutting point.]
;W[ll];B[lm]TR[kn]C[MM:  Seems too solid.  Better to make a diagonal jump like L6.  There is a proverb -- "chase with the keima, run away with the hane."]
;W[nk]TR[nm]C[MM:  The O7 cutting point is now inconvenient for Black.]
;B[kl];W[nm]TR[ok][ol]C[MM:  White mistake -- better to play P9 or P8, and stay connected to the right side group.]
;B[ol];W[om];B[ok]C[MM: Nice!];W[pm]C[Left an opening in my moyo wall but I figured it was worth it since the stones in the center look dead.  I expect black is ahead by 20+ points

MM:  Counting, I see roughly 60 firm points for Black (assuming White gets to reduce the upper right corner), and about 40 for White.  So the B+20 estimate is reasonable.  However, given how much potential White has, I would rather have White's position.]
;B[ki];W[kj]C[MM:  Bad move.  White should give up this group, and maybe have it as a ko threat later, or threaten to rescue it from the outside to reduce Black in sente.]
;B[ji];W[kk];B[lk];W[mk];B[jl]C[MM:  Nice!];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi]
;B[oh];W[oe];B[pf];W[pe];B[qc]C[MM:  You killed White's center group, and in trying to save it White forced you to strengthen the corner, so White gave up the corner reduction.  Very nice for Black!]
;W[re];B[rd];W[pb];B[pa];W[qa];B[qb];W[oa];B[pc];W[pa];B[ra]
;W[na];B[sb];W[cj]C[Hmmm now where to attack];B[cn]TR[fp][no]
C[MM:  Not a bad place.  I like F4 better.  Also, it may be worth gote to plug the hole at O5 -- that is worth about 15 points, I think.]
;W[gq];B[bp];W[np]TR[no]MA[dp][gq]C[I don't think I played this very good, sort of thought I was pretty far ahead so I probably played too loose but white 02 doesn't seem like a good move

MM:  I think White 102 would be more secure at O5.  But, what is White doing with the D4-G3 stones?  They are not alive yet!]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[kn];W[jp];B[kp]TR[ip][iq][kq]C[MM:  Maybe this is better at J4, J3, or L3.  But the actual move at L4 would be my first instinct.  I guess White will be able to live now.  White showed good technique, touching a strong stone, since both players usually become stronger in the local area (which is effectly a gain for the player who was weaker in the local area, and causes overconcentration for the locally stronger player).]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[iq]TR[lp]C[MM: I'm not sure about this move.  The M4 cutting point will cause trouble.]

MM:  I disagree with your score estimate.  Including prisoners and komi, Black seems to be about 5 points up, not 20 -- and that's assuming that Black gets to play next in the top left corner.  If White is able to keep that corner, then it looks like White is ahead by 5 to 10.
B 85];B[cq]TR[lp]C[MM:  It is nice to get the corner!];W[lp]
C[MM:  Now White rescued some stones, I think White is ahead slightly.]
;B[ko];W[mq]LB[cf:a]C[oops didn't see that  at the time I did not realize how big that was in points I played the rest of the game as if I was way ahead but actually I think that made the game pretty close. I am probably only up by 10 points or so... had I realilzed this I probably would not have played at the 3-3 point and instead would have played at a

MM:  Yes, White is happy Black didn't see the atari and cut.  KGS Score Estimator has White ahead by 28 points.  I think White actually is ahead by about 20.]

[sa][sc][sq][sr][ss]C[So I guess now white still has a chance to take the game

MM:  I estimate Black 76, White 66.5 with komi and captures.  Black gained from the corner invasion and is now about 10 points ahead.  The score *is* close enough for White to come from behind and win merely by keeping sente through the endgame.]
;B[fe]TR[ej][eo][fg][fo][gf]C[I don't think I like 39 now at all...where would have been better.... had a tough time here figuring out where to play and what was the most important?

MM:  This aims to reduce the White territory in sente, but it seems too deep and likely to be cut off.  Just a little closer to the main group should be fine.  Also, expanding the moyo in in the lower left center, or connecting the corner to the moyo in sente (by threatening to cut off the D4 (square) stone), should be very good.  I like the points marked by triangles (G14 or G13 to hurt White's moyo, E5 or F5 to connect Black's moyo and corner, or E10 for overall center connection).]
;W[ee];B[dh]TR[ff][fg]C[MM:  Black is trying too hard.  The natural moves at F14 or F13 would be fine.]

;W[hf];B[if];W[he];B[hg];W[hb]TR[er][or]C[70 was pretty big huh

MM:  Yes, stopping the monkey jump is worth 10 points or so -- pretty big for this stage of the game.  Black still has moves like E2 and P2 though.]

I figured that black had all of the corners, plus a big center area with a large dead white group... how could white even be close... some of my slack plays at the end almost came back to bite me.
leah2: 82.5 to mtgo2: 89.0

MM:  Since White gets komi, Black can't "win by komi."  Black would have won by 13 without the komi.  I guess you mean, it was a pretty close game.  How could it be that close?  It does seem surprising, since Black has the corners and White lost a medium-sized group in the center.  White's top side - left side group is larger than it seems.  Also, Black has some inefficient stones played. The chains at L5, R15, and C6 (triangles) are not surrounding territory, though they do connect the groups.  I guess the main lesson of this game is, check the score every several moves.  Good luck with your future games!]
)
(;W[qi]C[MM: White should not make this move because it would be very overconcentrated -- too many stones in one area, making not enough territory.  Black would be very happy if White played here.]
))
(;W[qm]C[MM: This looks like a bad move.  White seems overconcentrated, and Black will be provoked into building a thick wall guarding the corner.]
