;W[or];B[qm]C[Philippe> with this R7 stone, I think that my Q4 group is alive. So I choose to let White live below, in exchange of other stones in the goban (such as the following at K12).

Strategic mistake ?

I think you should keep dead groups dead... but it actually takes him a lot of moves to actually live, so feel free to let him play a bunch of moves and then kill him.]

Good];W[ii];B[gi];W[fi];B[gg];W[fh];B[cc]C[Philippe> At this step, I choose to invade the upper left corner. While I will live in the corner, White will build a wall around it, but as I already have stones around his wall, I think the wall won't be useful for him. Is this argument valid ?

Hmm but your stones are weak compared to his wall, the 1 space jump can be cut.]

That area is pretty small 6 points at best, maybe you can find a better spot.  I think d11 is best though, if you really want these points.]

Even if it does need a ko, I think that I have more big ko-threats than white (one big at F19, and one another at C18)...

Black has 5 ko threats on the board, White has 5 as well, you will need to take the ko first to win.]
