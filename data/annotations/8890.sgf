C[Hello, I'm Clement, I will do the review of your game and try to help you as much as I can.

Please feel free to contact me on KGS [cb22\] to ask any question or to go further in your review]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ic];W[kq]C[cb : I dislike to go on the same opening as the opponent, it looks like he's going to decide first how the game will go and it make me feel behind...]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[en];W[fp];B[dk]
(;W[dl]C[cb : Take care here. Black has a stone in the upper corner so you don't want to help him create thickness and developping a nice moyo..]

;W[ei];B[ch]C[cb : great for you, all his move previous are now lost.]
;W[ek];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bq];W[bp];B[er];W[fr];B[es]
C[cb : Don't try to kill if not sure a 100%. you're losing more than you think here. Aji, endgame, ko threat...]
;W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[dr];W[gl];B[fk]C[cb : one move to the right, so much better. You create a snapback and black will have a hard time to save his stones...]
(;W[ej];B[fl]TR[ek][gl]SQ[fk]C[cb : very bad shape... black cutting white stones like this is bad most of the time ! Try to avoid this]
;W[dm]C[cb : you should play somewhere else and leave this for later. It's small and slow for the moment]
;B[fn]C[cb : Small, black should take sente and play somewhere else IMO]
;W[dn]LB[qf:A][pj:B]C[cb : quite small at this moment... You should play urgent moves or big moves like corner approach or developping you're moyo!]
;B[df]C[cb : small];W[ed]C[cb : Hard for white. You're only reducing black territory. There is more opened area where to play. Here you will surely end gote with a heavy group cause there not much space to live...]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fe];B[gc];W[fb];B[gd];W[fd]C[cb : black has been reinforced and white is heavy with no eye... dangerous time !]
;B[lc];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd]
(;W[rd]C[cb : Not good, you're ruining the possibility to invade the corner later. Black]
;B[qc];W[pi];B[pg];W[pf];B[qe]C[cb : black is playing strange...]
;W[nh];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[qg];B[mf]C[cb : bad exchange for black IMO]
;W[lg];B[ng];W[og];B[mh];W[mg];B[nf];W[mi];B[lh];W[kh]C[cb : very very awful for black...]
;B[lf];W[li];B[oq];W[op];B[qq];W[pp]C[cb : good for white. threat black and building a nice area !!]
;B[pq];W[nq];B[rq];W[rp];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[pr]C[cb : losing sente...]

(;W[sg];B[rj];W[ri];B[ro];W[sp];B[qn];W[rk];B[rl];W[sj]C[cb : I'm not going to try to see if black can live, but the point here is that you have take great risk that could have cost you the victory... Luck was on your side ;-)]

;B[gk];W[hn];B[im];W[eg]C[cb : to summarize this game and what I can tell to you to work on :

1) take care of you're choice of joseki. Try to see how it could develop. Black could have get a lot better in the opening if he had know joseki.

2) try so see moves like the early snapback. Increase you're reading with easy tsumego. This kind of moves always make the difference in the end.

3) try to evaluate the score (not exactly, but approximate as much as you can) and decide what's the best strategy for you. You took big risks while it was unnecessary. It was a gamble on the victory, and Go is rarely a game of luck ! This kind of strategy are only good when you're late and you must do anything to come back.]

[en][fn][aq][sq][ms]TW[lh][mh][dj][dk]C[cb : you're not losing much playing this way and you're quite sure too kill black cause he's facing two big wall ! you should make a pause here and evaluate the score.

80 for white + 4 prisonners
84 for black + no prisonner

(it's only an approximation)

So you see, black here can't make more point (no real area to develop)

But you, you can kill the black group or gain point will threatening him.

So for the moment here, you should begin to seek for big endplay moves !]

[el][fl][en][fn]C[cb : this could be very good to have a wall like this ! center would become great for you, nice moyo and big threat on black group will help you get a lot of point ! And it's still possible to invade the upper right corner]
