earlier.

Let me know if this analysis is useful.

;W[oa]C[1st line moves are usually endgame moves, and too early for this
stage of the game. You should be thinking about the connecting the cut at
q15 and the weakness of the stringy white weak group.

Maybe build strength in center by attacking and then cutting at q 15.]
