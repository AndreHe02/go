C[Hello.

I do not have any specific questions, only the overly general "What did I do wrong?". I considered the opening — up to approximately move 36 — to be fine enough, but by the middle of the game (perhaps the two points of realization were around the move 90 and the move 145) I saw that I was losing and that the opponent wasn't going to make a large enough mistake. So the rest I played out of inertia.

Thanks in advance.

*Kungfu*: Hi!

[[jts - I'm assuming I'm reviewing for White.\]\]

[[jts - Okay, so. I think your biggest problem is judgment about which areas of the board are potentially worth how many points. This shows up at various points. You say that at 90 and 145 you felt hopeless. In fact, at 90 you were well ahead, if anyone was; at 145, the game was neck and neck, and you had the initiative. At 30, you failed to see the need to attack B6, and you failed to see the significance of your position on the right side for joseki choice in the top right (luckily, so did your opponent). Starting at 60 you start attacking B6, but you fail to see your potential for making territory on the bottom while you attack. Subsequently, you heavily emphasized the upper-center after B had already protected there, instead of the corners and sides where there was still a lot of territory to be hashed out. At the bitter end, you elected to jump into B's corners, far too late, in a way that only did damage to your own position by setting up a hopeless ko. -- To sum up, if you had understood who had how many point, and where on the board points were likely to be made, you would have won the game handily.  -- Hard to say how you could improve at this. The first thing I would check is how long you spent thinking about the critical moves, but you stripped out the time data. Experience works, practicing your counting works, getting your games reviewed works. ------- Tactically speaking you could probably improve, but you look fairly good. You made a number of small tactical errors in different sequences that cost you about ~5-10 points at a time, but he did too, and in the hugely important sequence starting at 40 you played flawlessly. ---- Feel free to email me with any other questions you have.\]\]]

However, I would have consdiered solidifying rather than taking the enclosure in the lower left. You have two cutting points, and you can't defend boht of them with a net. The squares represent one way of measuring the points you can expect to get from your influence (every square within three intersections that's closest to your stones), i.e. 22 points -- but if your stones are thin and cuttable, you should divide that number in two, I've heard, which becomes 11 points. --------- I've indicated some ways to solidify your stones in the variations. ------- As an aside: just because you can expet to get 22 points from this position, doesn't mean you can expect to get them *here*... they will most likely show up as an advantage in fighting.\]\]]

C[[[jts - Wrong direction, in two ways. (i) Wrong part of the board. Imho, the safety of the C6 stones... sandwiched as they are betwen your strong positions... is the key to those game. Attack! A, B, and C look like ideas. (ii) Even if you do need to approach this stone, you're ruining your position by encouraging Black to settle the right side quickly.\]\]]

;B[oj];W[fk]LB[ek:A]C[[[jts - good. This gives B too much too hope for, imho - when you're attacking you want to be severe. A move at "A" doesn't leave any aji. You only start to make thin moves when you are sure you can completely enclose, and then kill, the weak group. However, again: this is good. You've correctly intuited the biggest area on the board.\]\]]
;B[hm];W[ik]LB[ik:B][go:A]TR[hm][en]C[[[jts -- wrong side. You're pressuring Black's group, yes, but in the wrong way. You want to claim points on the side with "A", and then force Black to run towards the worthless region at "B". Instead you've blocked off the worthless region, and forced him to run towards the points. --- Also, you should be aiming at the weak connection between the marked Black stones: "B" doesn't threaten this connection.\]\]]
