AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[C: Hi, I'm about 2d based on playing in Tokyo, Japan. I'll mark my comments with a C, just so you know it's me. Just a small fyi, take what I say with a grain of salt. There's a lot of players out there stronger than me, so I'm by no means recommending the best moves! With that said, I'll do my best to analyze the game and try to point out where you could have done better.

Hi, here's a game where I played black and lost in endgame. This means that I made just enough mistakes to review :)

Could you please show me where I lost my initial advantage, and how I could improve my game ?
Many Thanks !];W[qf];B[nc];W[fq];B[cn];W[mp];B[pn];W[ql]C[C: You tend to see this move a lot in handicap games where white must play faster. The "classic" answers are at R11 and P7.

I'm always lost with this move. Is there's a classical answer ?]
(;B[qj]C[C: Locally, this pincer is not bad. However, with the white stone on R14, you might want to consider P7 instead. See the variation for a possible attack.]
;W[ol];B[qm]C[C: You're right. It is much more important to jump out at O6 to separate the groups. Generally, in handicap games, you want to pay more attention to the center in order to use the power of the star point stones.

Probably a bad exchange for black, as the corner will still be open.]
;W[rl];B[nn]C[C: Notice that your stone on R10 is much weaker after the R7, S8 exchange.]
;W[pi];B[re]C[C: Notice how now you must sacrifice the stone on R10 now because of white R14 and the R7, S8 exchange.]
;W[rf];B[kp]C[C: This pincer is too closer. Consider K4 instead.]
;W[lo];B[hq];W[fo];B[ho];W[mm]C[C: The issue is that you started the attack after the right side is already strong. White has the option of connecting the N4 group to the right or the F3 group, making an attack here difficult. If you were looking to attack the bottom side, it would have been better to lean on the right, looking to build a wall you can attack into later. For that, look at the variation before starting at P7 instead of R10.

Now my corner is enclosed and white connected. How could I have prevented this result ?]
;B[rm]C[C: This move is unnecessary. Your corner is alive and the points are small at this stage in the game.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[qo]C[C: Yes, this is a bit slow. It is better to take sente, the two stones are small. Also, notice that now white is much stronger on the outside.

Maybe slow, but I think it was good enough to close the corner.]
;W[ko];B[dr];W[er];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[fm];B[hm];W[fk];B[gr]
C[C: I don't like this move. You want to save the possibility of a capture for the endgame here. It is much better and more active to jump into the center than to live inside.]
;W[fr];B[hk]C[C: Good!];W[fi];B[nq]C[C: You need to continue in the center. Because of the white wall on the right, your center group is not safe yet.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[jp];B[ip];W[jq];B[km]C[C: H11 would be better here. You need to think about neutralizing the white wall on the right. Because both the white and black dragon points up, K16 is very important and you want to consider building up to take that point first.]
;W[lm];B[kk];W[fc];B[cf]C[C: Not necessarily, but that is the right way of thinking. You want to be thinking about influence for the attack. Especially because C6 is also low, playing on the third line is not good here. Like you already considered, F16 is an option, D14 is also a simple, but good, response.

Was F16 better to separate white ?];W[qd];B[qc]C[C: There is a better reply locally, look at the variation beginning at black R15 where you played S16 instead. However, if white plays first locally, the corner is lost. This waist cut is normal, black needs an additional stone at Q15 after white S14 to lock in the corner.

I lost many points in these exchanges. Was there a bette reply locally ?]
;W[rc]
(;B[rd];W[qe];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[se];B[jc]C[C: This move is fine from a distance standpoint, but it is too greedy. You really want to be thinking about separating the F11 group. 

A bit far, but I thought it was ok as F17 isn't strong.];W[lc]
;B[ld]C[C: This cap is almost never good. Consider H17 to create the base. Depending on the side white plays, you can build strength and attack the other side. It will be hard for whie to save all the groups.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[md];B[lb];W[le];B[mc];W[jd];B[ic]C[C: This sequence is painful for black. Now the central white group is very safe and black only takes third line territory.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[kn];B[im];W[in];B[jn];W[io]C[C: White is just saving the J6 stone without having to worry about an endgame ko fight.

I don't understand this white move. Is it a mistake, or is there any use to it that I don't see ?]
;B[hn];W[jo];B[eo];W[fp];B[en];W[fn];B[hi]C[C: The wrong direction. You can't extend up now because of the white wall. Better to take the territory at D10. Your center group has a lot of eye shape and is not in immediate danger.]
;W[fg];B[mk];W[lj];B[kj];W[lk];B[li];W[mi];B[ji]C[C: You're correct.

L11 was probably better.];W[lh];B[ig];W[ki];B[ij]C[C: You have two eyes without this move.

Maybe useless, but I wasn't quite sure about the status of this group.]
;W[ch];B[db];W[np];B[op];W[pr]C[C: This is a nice tesuji from white. The pivot in the triangle shape is the general weak point. It is a good idea to run over such weak points just to make sure there's nothing wrong, both your own and your opponents.

Here I was simply outplayed, I didn't see what white was doing at all.]
;B[qq];W[sm];B[rn];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[rq];W[oq];B[or];W[os]
;B[pq];W[ms];B[ne]C[C: I think cutting the F17 stone is bigger.]
;W[fe];B[gb]C[C: The biggest extension is on the left side.]
;W[eb];B[cc];W[gc];B[of]C[C: Bigger to save your G18 stone, especially since an extension on the left is sente with no white eyes yet.]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[cl]C[C: White takes the last big point.];B[cj]
C[C: An overplay. The correct sequence is B13 and B7 in sente followed by H17.]
;W[cm];B[bn];W[bf];B[be];W[df];B[ce];W[em]C[C: Now white has protect his group in sente, the difference is big.]

;B[me];W[kg];B[jh];W[nm];B[on];W[hr];B[gq];W[gs];B[lf];W[ke]
C[C: I would consider E19 here. The center is not worth too many points since you can still save the M14 stone anyway. In any case, I think it actually doesn't make a difference whether you play M13 or N13.]
;B[lg]C[was N13 bigger ?];W[mg];B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[mh];B[ea]

;W[gj];B[sc];W[rd];B[ng];W[pf];B[og];W[ln];B[bl]C[C: If you were worried about the cut at J9, you should've played it now.]
;W[ik];B[hl];W[mo];B[il]C[C: This cost you 1 pt.];W[ps];B[tt]
;W[ss];B[tt];W[gn];B[tt];W[gp];B[tt];W[go];B[tt];W[tt]C[C: You didn't play poorly, but there were some places where reduced the handicap advantage. The biggest case is in the opening on the right. When you're playing with a big handicap, you never want to let white settle quickly. Instead of jumping right in with R10, it can pay to be a little more patient and build up strength before attacking, especially because white has to play on both sides. One good attack on either side can win you the game. With your 4 stone advantage all on the star point, you have to start thinking about playing for influence, even if you're a territory player in even games.

The other note is the endgame sequence on the left. The simple moves keeping sente would have given a better result in the end, you need to be sure pincers and invasions have a good chance before playing them. That seemed to be your weakness in both cases, you made aggressive moves at C10 and R10, but then had to abandon them almost immediately, so be more careful in the future.

Other than that, you played a solid game, it takes a unique style to take advantage of handicaps to the fullest, so don't worry too much and just pay more attention to your attacking game.

Thanks for the review !])
(;B[qe];W[rd];B[pe];W[qb];B[pc];W[se]C[C: The black shape is much stronger than the actual result in the game.]
))
(;B[om];W[pi];B[jp];W[mn];B[eq];W[fp];B[hp]C[C: You may want to consider this attack. Depending on white, you want to be looking at J7 and P9 as possible continuations. Both build into black K16 if you can get sente.]
