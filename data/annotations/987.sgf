C[I played this game rather recently after not playing for a few weeks. I tried to improve my beginning game, by not allways just responding locally, but trying to take big points.

I am around 10-12k and so was my opponent (apparently)];B[dd]
;W[pp];B[pc];W[dp];B[qe]LB[jd:A]C[I liked this start. I have had something similar played against me before and I am quite happy for this as an opening taking advantage of the black lead. Any comments?

>> I like this opening too, its one of the more standard openings that you see.
(not necessarily the best.)
The "focal" point of this opening is k16 (A), White usually responds here, if not
its a great spot for black];W[fc];B[jc]C[Loose pincer to strengthen q17]
;W[dc];B[cd]C[Was contemplating c17. Saw some danger at c13 if he played there, forcing life, but he didn't]
;W[ed];B[cg]C[So I played there, securing the top left of the board and leaving corner undecided]
;W[hd]LB[fg:A]C[>> I dont like white H16 here. It asks black to strengthen the k17 stone, which he
does next

A better move for white would be at a(f13) or simply to play elsewhere]
;B[je]C[I liked this as it made a nice? shape. Any other recommendations to keep the presure on yet build up on the top right?

>> this works nicely with the upper right corner to map out territory
It doesnt really put pressure on  the white group which is pretty strong]
;W[pj];B[cn]C[was hoping for a bottom board response and then to take a point around c10]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[cj]LB[cl:A][em:B]C[This worked just as well.


>> i would prefer A or b here, You dont want white to get too much center influence
if you play at A and white invades at c10 you have a great target to attack]
;W[em]C[This left the cutting point but, I think I had to respond?

>> yes, you had to respond to this, if you played elsewhere, both c7 and d8  would have
been great for white
If c10 had been at c8 you could respond at e8, which is slightly better]
;B[dl];W[el];B[jp]C[To prevent k4 being taken by him :) Maybe the cut first? But I wasn't sure it would still work and this seemed bigger

>> I agree. Save the cutat d5 for later when you know how usefull it would be]
;W[hp];B[nq]C[>> This is a little too wide here, white is strong on the left and attacking at m3 could
well seperate your group in half.];W[np]LB[lq:A][pn:B][qn:C]
C[>> White just helped your possition here, w should attack at A or strengthen
his position for a later atack at A. (Using b or c)];B[mp];W[no]
;B[oq];W[qq]C[wasn't sure what to do after r3, so I decided to play elsewhere, trying to make the top right bigger. I was contemplating n13 which I think would of been better]

(;B[ph];W[qi];B[qh]C[>> you should be pushing towards your thickness, not away
 Dont expect that corner to get really big, want you want to do is keep
white small and push him towards your large group so that you can defend it while
pressing him];W[ee];B[eg]LB[df:A]C[to try and enclose the white group

>> A is preferable here, it protects your area and the two black stones and still
leaves you with the ability to get out to the center
It would be really hard to enclose the white group, it has plenty of room to get to the
center.];W[mg];B[me]C[he got there first];W[mo];B[lp];W[io]
;B[kn];W[nj];B[mm]C[to try and decrease the territory on the right (better ideas?)]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[lo];W[mn];B[kl];W[jm];B[mk]C[trying to find space for life, with the option of withdrawing to the top or the left, while also threating the right side. (I was not sure it could live by it self)

>> You might be able to exploit p4 a little here];W[ll];B[lk]
;W[nm];B[ml];W[nl];B[nk];W[ok];B[jj];W[op];B[mi]C[try to join to the top]
;W[ni];B[mh];W[nh];B[ng]C[was I strong enough to cut here?]
;W[mj]C[>> blocking at m10 would probably have worked fine. (see the variation)]

(;B[lg]C[secures the top but makes life hard for the middle group]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[lj];B[gj]C[L9 should of been played at this stage?

>> w l9 does capture];W[mf];B[nf];W[lf];B[kf]C[why he played that sequence I don't know.]
;W[og];B[of];W[rh]LB[rg:A]C[>> A is fine here]
(;B[qf];W[rg];B[rf]LB[ek:A]C[I feel as though I lost a lot of points in this sequence, but was there a better alternative? Should I have been looking elsewhere?

>> S14 is pretty small.  E9 Would have been fine];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj]C[This makes joining up with the left hard..]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fi];B[ih]C[trying to give room to the centre group while also threatening to connect to the top area - stil cuttable though..]
;W[gg];B[fg]C[try to force the connection];W[hh]
(;B[gi]LB[hi:A]C[>> this should be at A, still forces the connection, but leaves you with  a move to connect to the top]
;W[gh];B[hi]C[this makes the connection secure between j12 and k10]
;W[gf];B[if];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[jg]C[I think this should of just been a simple connection at j13]
;W[kk];B[jl]C[Should of seen this earlier];W[ll];B[im];W[in]
;B[jn];W[lm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hk]C[This was too small.. the big points I see are :
H18, (is that the best place to start?)
J3 (again, is this the best place?)
c18
Is it too late to try to do something about the bottom right?

>> this is fine , white must protect his area now which leaves you with sente
And some aji for use later];W[gn];B[cc]C[got one of them, but maybe not the right point.]
;W[db];B[pr]C[another bigish point];W[qr];B[do]C[try to cut...

>> if your arent going to follow up with the cut at e4, save this for later
It leaves you with 1 extra liberty if white tries to use c7]
;W[eo];B[he]C[force life];W[ge];B[hb]C[big point, and really force life if ignored]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jd];B[kd]C[this was confusing];W[id];B[kc]C[but it seemed to work out (but lost sente, prolly j3 first)]
;W[ci];B[dh]C[response to threat];W[cl];B[cm]C[I was uneasy here, but not sure why, b8 seems better]
;W[cf]C[
>> This is where you see the moves i suggested earlier would have
helped.. (d14 and c8) Both of those would have removed all the
aji white uses to his advantage now)];B[bf];W[be];B[ce]C[this lead to an interesting battle]
;W[df];B[bg];W[cb];B[bb]C[but this secured it I think];W[iq]
;B[jq]C[should of played here before before losing sente];W[jr]
;B[kr];W[ir];B[fb]C[I played this to try and punish c11];W[gc]
;B[gb]C[>> This should kill white, he only has 1 eye];W[ig]
;B[hg]C[This higlights the silly connection,  I feel I could of killed the group otherwise]

;B[kh];W[ie];B[bl]C[The paranoia finally gave way];W[bo];B[bn]
;W[bp];B[ki];W[ps];B[os]C[I nearly lost this whole group];W[qs]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[gm];W[fn];B[ff];W[fe];B[eb];W[jo];B[ec]C[I just did this as it seemed like the bigger win]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[oh];B[pf]C[>> small right now, white will get this if you leave it here, but
something at the bottom is better here];W[sf];B[se];W[sg]LB[ri:A]

>> l1 might be better];W[ri];B[ko]C[worth 4..];W[pq];B[or]C[>> l1 deffinatly worth more]

Thanks for having a look

>> Your welcome.  Some general comments:

Trying to defend your upper territory early let white build his lower right
territory.

You tend to leave a lot of  bad aji in your positions (potential for white to do your
groups harm ;-) Some slightly better shape in the beginning would have helped
you towards the end.
