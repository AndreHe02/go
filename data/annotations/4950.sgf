C[Hello!

My name is Tim and I'll be reviewing your game. I am around 12kyu or so on KGS. If you have a KGS account, you can contact me there (my name is Talaer) if you'd ever like a teaching game or more reviews. If you have any questions regarding this review, you can email me: helxis@comcast.net

Thanks!
-------------------------------------------

First of all, thank you for taking the time for me and reviewing my game.

I recently started playing go (few weeks ago), so I guess I still make stupid moves here and there, but I hope I will learn fast :)

This is a game I played on IGS. I am White. Both mine and my opponent's rank is 22k.

I would like to get some general tips on how to improve my game.

I don't have  much concrete questions, I could ask, but annotated this game, mentioning plans, and i'll ask question on certain moves.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp]TR[cn]C[I thought moving towards the center here, would be a good thing. Although I also considered playing at E5; would that have been better, to pressurize the stone at C6 a bit more?
-------------------------------------

In the opening like this, you should just play with whatever style you find most comfortable. There are a lot of playable moves here, including E5, D6, and F3. Also there are pincer moves that could be played around C8.

For now you should experiment and see which sorts of moves you like the best. 

The one you played is perfectly fine. :)];B[op]
(;W[nc]LB[cl:A]TR[dd]C[here I thought it might be wise to do some attacking of myself, so I choose this corner as this would nicely work together with my stone at D16.
------------------------------------

This move is fine also. One thing to keep in mind is also that Black ignored your move at F4 for now. A move around C8 now could be pretty painful.]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[since Black ran along the side, I thought it would be good to take some territory along the upper side.]
;B[ck];W[df];B[dh]
(;W[fj]C[Both trying to block, and make a connection for my own stones possible, or to the upper or lower side.
---------------------------

This move is very strange to me. What are you trying to block B from? Your stone is very far away from your other stones and seems lost out in the middle. It practically invites B to attack you!

At this stage in the opening, you should always think about which areas are biggest (capable of generating the most points). Right now, the right side is very open, but if B is allowed to block it in, he will have a LOT of points that you may not be able to compete with.

Therefore, I think a good move right now would be R9.];B[fh]
C[B goes on the attack and aims to reduce your top side moyo.]
;W[eh]C[This cut seemed good, because I surely would be able to connect, after Black attacks my stone.
----------------------
Usually you do not try to cut a one point jump in this manner. For instance in this case, you only managed to help B get a stronger position and hurt your F10 stone more. However, it is hard to find a seemingly 'good' move in this area because F10 is awkwardly placed to begin with.]
;B[ei];W[eg];B[fi];W[jp]C[I didn't see any local threats which needed to be answered so I staked some more territory. (This is called tenuki right?)
-------------------------------
This is called tenuki, but I think the R9 move is much bigger than this one.]
;B[lq];W[di]C[Separating the black stones to make his groups weak.
---------------------
Good idea! I'm not sure if this cut actually works though. B played his atari in the wrong direction though, so you got a good result!]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[ej]
(;W[ch]C[Taking advantage of the fact that Black didnt play on C12.]
;B[dk];W[dg]C[Is it wise to take now, or should I just play elsewhere?]
;B[cj];W[dh];B[hf]
(;W[fe];B[hd];W[he]C[again the same type of cut as earlier, with a sure possibility to connect after Black attacks my stone.
---------------------

Again, you can not usually get a good result by trying to cut a 1 point jump in this fashion. B is left with many options from this move.]

(;B[ge];W[ie];B[ff];W[gd]C[Double attack on G15 and H16, and therefore winning a stone.]
;B[gf];W[hc];B[ne];W[ee]C[Protecting against the cut at F16.]
;B[fg];W[jj]C[I am not sure, whether this was well-timed or maybe too early, but I thought this move was nice in combination with my stones at F10 and J4 and my group at I15
----------------------------
The right side is still the most open part of the board. This stone does not make many points for you or hurt your opponent very badly.]
;B[pj]C[Ouch!
B is now generating a very very large area.];W[lj]C[Pushing from the center towards Black to strengthen my influence and to block Black.
-------------------
Correct sort of idea, but not a great way to go about it. Black can just play something like Q7 and continue to grow his area. You might try to form some kind of more severe reduction, perhaps R10.]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[ek];W[gk]C[Here I have a question. I also though about playing at F8; which of the two is better, and why?
-----------------
Either move is good for what you are trying to do. However, these two stones are not very important because they are not cutting any groups apart. If B takes them, he will only gain 4 points. (They aren't even easy for him to take, because the ladder is not good for him.) Right now there are still moves on the board worth a lot more points!]
;B[fl];W[hk]C[Pressuring Black's stone at G10, while moving to my stones in the center
----
Same applies here.];B[ii];W[ij]C[I was thinking about playing at G11, but this didn't seem to work, so I played here to strengthen my influence in the center.]
;B[hi];W[jh];B[ji];W[ki]C[Cutting here to connect afterwards.]
;B[kh];W[jg]C[Running towards my other group.];B[kg];W[kf];B[li]
;W[kj];B[mi];W[lh]C[This looked good to me, although in hindsight I saw that after black plays at L13 my stone is dead right?
-------
Correct];B[mh]C[But B gave them to you anyway! :)];W[lg];B[mg]
;W[ml]C[Extending some more.];B[ol]C[B's right side is now huge and nearly impossible to reduce in any major way.]
;W[mn];B[gn];W[fn]C[Turning my attention to my group on the lower side, it looked weak now.]
;B[fm];W[fo];B[em];W[gm]C[Cutting and pressurizing the stone at G6
------
Good! This helps make your center area very large. This helps put you in the lead unless B is able to invade your corner at C17.]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[hl]
(;W[hn]C[Ok winning the stone at G6.];B[il]C[Ouch! This practically erases your entire center area. I think it is possible for you to have simply blocked B off.]
;W[hj]LB[pb:B][on:D][bo:C][kq:A]C[Is this a good move, or can I play elsewhere here?
-------------
This move is very 'small' because it is trying to capture one stone. Try to find bigger moves anytime you have the opportunity. I will mark some.]
;B[gi];W[on]C[Trying to get into Black's territory and separating his group on the side from his group in the corner.
-----
Good!];B[pn];W[nm];B[om];W[nj];B[mj];W[nk];B[kl];W[mf];B[nf]
;W[ng]C[In hindsight I think this cut is a bad move, I will lose my stone soon.
--------
Yes];B[nh];W[og];B[oh];W[pg];B[ph];W[qg];B[qf];W[qh];B[qi];W[rf]
;B[re];W[qe];B[rg];W[sg]C[This was bad as well, I guess I lost my concentration for a bit here.]
;B[sf];W[sh];B[rh];W[pe];B[of];W[od];B[qd];W[oe];B[md];W[nd]
;B[me];W[rd]C[Here I tried to sacrafice a stone in order to build some territory in the upper right corner. Was this a good plan?
--------
Sacrifice tactics are sometimes very good to use. B let you have a little more than he should have in this case.]
;B[rc];W[qc]
(;B[sd];W[pc];B[rd]
(;W[ob]C[Playing this in order to created some eyes for my group.]

The biggest thing that could change the outcome of this game is to have played bigger moves in the beginning. As you play more games, they will become more and more natural for you. Play lots of games to develop that experience. Also, you should try to solve Go problems to help your reading skill whenever you can.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
