C[Jared: This seems to be a well played game. The more I do these reviews and the stronger I get the more hesitant I am to criticize. I look back on early gam
es that I have commented on and cringe at the thought that I criticized moves that were better than my alternative suggestions. Someone could probably hand me a pro game and I would probably be ignorant enough to criticize it as well. So, with that in min
d, let's take a look at this game...];B[dp];W[pq];B[dd];W[qd]
;B[od];W[ld]C[White 6 is unwise. See variation.]
(;B[qc]C[Black 7 is not joseki. The pincer at white 6 prevents black from utilizing the thickness gained from the attachment at 7.]
;W[rc];B[pc];W[re];B[of];W[qh]C[Black 13 misses the point. It should be at b to take advantage of white's choice of a pincer
 for move 6. Remember: corner, sides, center. b is on the side. a is in the center.]

(;B[lf];W[id]C[So with 14 white gets an ideal base on the side.]
;B[gc];W[fq]C[With 15, black has chosen to undercut white's base. A natural move would be for white to jump into the center with 16. Since white has chosen to play away, a good choice for bla
ck 17 might be to immediately pressure white at b. This might allow black to take control of the game. Note that if white were to play 16 at b, then the black group at the upper right might be pressured. Even though the center is less important than the s
ides, URGENT moves are more important than anything.]
(;B[dn];W[jp]C[Another urgent move is the kakari against white 2 (or the shimari with it). If we choose to ignore the top, then 16 (and failing that, 18) should be a shimari. Recall: corner, sides, center. And 19 should be a kakari.]

(;B[cj]C[If white plays at b, white has a perfect (almost) double-wing formation.]

(;W[cf]C[White 20 is dangerous. White has a weak group at the top. White is about to create another weak group on the side. One should avoid having two weak groups on the board simultaneously. Black will seek to split these groups and use a double attack  to gain an advantage.]
;B[cd];W[qo];B[oo]C[White 24 at b starts a joseki...
  But I think a is a reasonable choice as white wants to defend the bottom more than the side. The bottom is larger.]

(;W[np]C[Black b is also possible.]
(;B[qn]C[White b starts one joseki...
  But white a gives black a better result.]
(;W[po];B[pn];W[on]C[Black 29 should be at b.]
(;B[pl];W[nn]C[White 30 seems small. I don't understand what white is trying to do. There are bigger moves on the board.
  Black 31 can be at b. See previous variation.]
(;B[qj]C[There is no urgency for white 31. The white group on the right side is safe. Whote should consider the top group or the left side stone. Or at very least, expand the lower moyo with a move like b.]

(;W[oh];B[me]C[Black 33 is overcautious. I'd be tempted to play Black 33 at white 34.]
;W[if];B[ef]C[Black 35 is a good splitting play.];W[di];B[dj]
;W[fi]C[Surely black b is an excellent move...]
(;B[mo]C[What is black 39? It is aji keshi. This is not where the action is.]
;W[no];B[lq]C[Black is creating a weak group and making endgame moves. Hey! There's a game going on on the upper and left sides. Hello?]
;W[jq];B[ko];W[in];B[lm];W[nk];B[ml];W[nl];B[mq];W[rl]C[See? Now black is in trouble after having created an extra (unnecessary) weak group.]
;B[ql];W[rn];B[rh];W[rg];B[oj];W[nj];B[qg];W[qf];B[ri];W[pg]
C[Black 61 at b I think is a little better.]
(;B[rk];W[qm];B[pm];W[rm];B[jm];W[sj];B[sk];W[ok];B[pk]C[White 70 at a is thin. It would be better one space lower.
  More importantly, we are not in the endgame. It is FAR TOO EARLY to consider a move like white 70. Don't forget that you are playing a game. The game is not over. There are weak groups to chase and/or protect. The white group on the bottom is not weak. At
tack the black group in the botom middle or top right (b or c). Or better yet, take the key point at d.]

(;W[fn];B[dq];W[dm]C[Since white failed to take the key point, black should (at b)]

(;B[cm];W[cl];B[dl];W[em];B[cn];W[ej]TR[cl]C[It is probably best to remove the aji of the marked white stone by playing at b.]

(;B[dk];W[ci];B[bj]TR[cj][dj][dk]C[Notice how the three marked stones give black an empty triangle. If you see a black empty triangle, it usually means that black has made a mistake.]
;W[mc];B[rb]LB[sc:c]C[White needs to keep focused. If white doesn't play at b th
en black will play at c. These moves are double sente, are big territorially and threaten the lives of the two groups involved. Do not play away here.]

(;W[il]C[Black should play at b.]
(;B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[hn];B[ik];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[mn]
;B[ln];W[jo];B[km]C[I take it I don't need to comment on the last few moves. The center is not the focus of this game. Thre are still groups whose life is in dispute and there are big endgame moves in the corners.]

  White should seize the opportunity to play sente moves starting with b.  The black group might even die. Black won't have time to play at c. But white shouldn't forget that black can play there. White must end in sente.]

C[I take it white resigned here. It helps if the people requesting the game commentary place a few comments on their game. This had none. The game record ends here. I don't even know if the play
ers had specific questions that they wanted answered.
  I continue for awhile, starting with a hypothetical play for white 146.]
