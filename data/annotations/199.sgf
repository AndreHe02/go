;B[dp]C[fierce fight];W[cd];B[ec];W[hd];B[cc];W[bc];B[dd];W[cb]C[runski: Shouldn't white extend at 'a' first?
Dennis this is one type of movement only; the combination depend very much
on what is on the
board.];B[ce];W[dc];B[db];W[cc];B[ee];W[eb];B[fb];W[da];B[fc]C[Denni
s : you may see that now your stones in move 19 and e17/f18 is not very
useful due to the h16 stone];W[pe];B[nd];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[ob];W[qi];B
[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[qk]C[Dennis : whenever there is a chance to make a 2  stone q6 & r6
can extend only 2 space apart i.e. r9, there is a gain on the other
side.];W[oi]C[Dennis : you may see that you are helping him on p11.  I
suspect your competitor is very high in standard.];B[kc]C[Dennis :  I don't
think the above is the major area of expansion; how about k3 or even
c10.];W[ok]C[Dennis : that is a price to pay for not playing the full
sequence; but I don't think there is a choice here.   I suspec that l17
should still be k3 so that when your 3 stones have to escape, white cannot
natural has many gain in the bottem];B[ol];W[nl];B[oo];W[op];B[mn];W[lp]
;B[pl];W[nm];B[no];W[mk];B[qj]C[Dennis : have you evaluted the
sequence of s11 and white s10; only if that is impossible that you move 45
and I suggest s9 and then s8  even in such case.];W[pj]C[runski: I think
white should connect at 'a' instead?  This mistake
allow
s black's group to settle.
Dennis  L strange move; why not just s10 to destory your eyes ? I donpt
thing any threat in the connection of white piece.];B[ri]C[Dennis :
white has lost very much here !!!!!!!!!!!!];W[qh];B[rh];W[rg];B[qg];W[qf]

Dennis : you have very good grasp of the good shape but I just wonder
whether the above is a battlefield worthwhile to use pieces the right
whitepieces should be the focas];B[kj];W[ll];B[kk];W[kl];B[pk]C[Dennis : why  not o10]
;W[nj];B[hf]C[denis what happen if white
k16; white can escape ... by attacking k14 and k15 if black
m19];W[ro]C[runski: Try to defend the 3-3 point invasion, hopefully in
sente.
Dennis : surprise, I would ignore it and concenctrate myself on j4];B[rn]
C[Dennis : if w s7 black s8 ... don't think black has any
problem];W[mo];B[nn];W[cn]C[Dennis : is it a right direction ?  white
should be f3 ... reason is that above b15 is sente and not much gain
above];B[cj]C[Dennis : not agreeable ! above is not the place, with white
k13 there, not much to gain];W[fp];B[eo];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[cr]C[

problem due to 3 connected piece around d9];W[hk];B[gl]C[Dennis : how about
an exchaneg of k9];W[hl];B[hi]C[runski: I guess both of us missed the  cut at 'a'.
