C[Close game that I lost because I didnt invade white's lower influence sphere (and I made a really dumb mistake at the end played too fast).]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cq];B[ic];W[jp]LB[cn:A][dn:B][dp:C]C[R> As you're playing the chinese Fuseki a moyo strategy, W should really try and take up position on one of the sides and so should B.

A, B look good, C is probably less good in this situation]
(;B[do]C[Didnt really know exactly where to play here so played on a point that seemed good for white.

;B[ph]LB[qh:A]TR[qe][pf]C[this didnt went well at all!

(;B[rd]C[also wrong.. tried to save the corner and the three stone group.. Q15 and then P13 would have been much better.

C[? suggestions ?

R> Well W is building up a lot of strength in the top right, the bottom of his moyo looks weak, and you have a couple of stones in the W moyo that can cause trouble. I'd try tengen soon, but also you can try around O3 or R6 to help you break up  the moyo.

;W[ch];B[bh];W[eh];B[je];W[hg]C[nice play by white

R> Yes, though he's concentrating on breaking up your moyo rather than improving his own. Also by playing contact plays you're helping W to become strong - exactly what you want to avoid.]

Don't make autoplay mistakes.];W[rb]C[So white wins becuase of the the mistakes black made in the opening. Black futhermore didn't took adavantage enough of the mistakes by white too make more of the invasions into white's moyo. Please comment and advice how to improve.

Many thanks,
Lothar.

R> Main points you need to work on are: -

1) Invade when you have support, or can make support.
(Your invasion at O3 wasn't well timed).

2) Hitting stones doesn't weaken them - it encourages your opponent to sttrengthen them. So attack from a distance.
(The kick at R15, and the play at B13)

3) When you're fighting try and keep your stones connected (unless you plan to sacrifice some to give you better speed).
(Missed play at Q11)

4) Play consistently (have a plan, play within it, and adapt it where necessary).

5) Autoplay mistakes :o).])
