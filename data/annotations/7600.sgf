C[elvard [5k\]: hi there

Hello, my name is Tapir. This review is made for white. 2010-01-09]

(;B[co];W[cm]LB[ch:A][cl:B]TR[cg]C[In this situation, marked stone should be little closer (at A)?

Tapir: Maybe. But the point of A is that you invade with a threat to connect, 
that you either can jump out or connect. If you want to use A you will have to
 invade one line north (B) as well. (see also http://senseis.xmp.net/?BQM496)]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[do]C[Tapir: As you played this, were you sure what will happen next?]

;B[fj];W[gm];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr];W[es]C[Tapir: Sometimes such a move is tesuji, but here it does not make additional eyes or anything, it just loses points as far as I see.]
;B[fg];W[nc];B[kd];W[hc]C[Tapir: I don't really understand white here.]
;B[ce]C[Tapir: The simple 33 invasion would have been fine for Black.]

;B[cc];W[dc];B[cb]
(;W[dj]LB[gh:A]C[Tapir: This move looks timid to me. White is connected already, as Black I would happy to give two stones for playing first on the outside. The point I would look at for attack is A, I don't believe black will have the time to connect his two stones.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[gk];W[im];B[hn];W[fl];B[gi]C[T];W[jj]LB[hm:A]
C[I want to prevent cut more lightly than playing just A

Tapir: Good plan. But the cut still remains as Aji for Black after the more cautious move Black made in the game.]
(;B[ii];W[pn]TR[gn][hn][dp][ep][fp][gp][gq][hr]C[Tapir: I guess you want to avoid the pincer. But the triangled black group is kind of weak and wants to be attacked, inducing O4 helps this group. Also G1 is sente now and the cut aji further helps Black, but still it is weak.]
;B[np];W[qj];B[fc]
(;W[fe]LB[fd:A]C[Mistake, I think... Kosumi would be better

Tapir: I doubt that Kosumi would be better. I added a new line (for a different black answer) and white is in trouble. Read what you fear that it can happen in fights, not gentle play! I would try A to connect but I have no clear idea what happens after Black G17. So better prevent this situation by defending earlier... :)]

Best timing would imo have been before making life with or even before playing the R4 stone. Since the White strength here would have helped these stones as well. (maybe allowing to cut at O5 etc.)]

Tapir: Indeed. But you forgot the bigger plays (>1 point) elsewhere in the meantime. (You lost sente here.) Imagine you get to play 1 2 3 instead of making a half point with M12 + L12. This would have been enough to win this game.]
