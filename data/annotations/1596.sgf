C[utwig [12k\]: hi

Dear GTL Reviewer, I had White in this game. I have a few specific questions at certain points (marked with "Malveaux:"), but please add whatever comments you deem appropriate.

Comment: Andre Bergholz, (2K) in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked  with AB)]
;B[pp]C[malveaux [11k\]: hello];W[dp];B[cd];W[pc];B[fq]LB[ec:A]
[qe:B]C[AB: Just a very minor thing, but usually it is more important to make a shimari or kakari for a stone at the 3-4 point (rather than the 4-4 point), so moves around 'A' or 'B' seem a little better to me.]
;W[ed]C[AB: Good!];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[pf]LB[jc:A]
[jd:B]TR[fc][fd][ed]C[Malveaux: I suppose this would be better at Q15 or R15?

AB: Your intuition that this move is not so great is right. However, your proposals are not so good. Here, it is of utmost importance to finish the joseki with either 'A' or 'B'. Otherwise, the three marked stones will become a good target for an attack. You chose a good joseki here, but you have to finish it. The group needs a base.]
;B[cn]C[AB: Very good, but Black could also play on the upper side immediately (I like L17, but maybe something more severe like J17 or H16 is better).]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[jq]LB[em:A]C[AB: This is not so good. 'A' is much better, you can play the pincer afterwards. The reason is...]

(;B[dj]C[AB: ...that Black could play more severe than this (see variation).]
;W[pj]LB[jd:A][go:B]TR[eo][dp][dq]C[AB: The White move is not urgent. Again, 'A' is excellent and gives White a more balanced position. But White must also pay attention that Black doesn't attack with 'B' all of a sudden. The three marked White stones look rather poor. With D10 now in place an attack could be rather severe.]
;B[mc]C[AB: Terrible, gives White the opportunity...];W[jc]
C[AB: ...to fix his problems. Well done :-).];B[jd];W[kd]LB[ic:A]
[id:B]C[AB: Risky! Just 'A' or 'B' would be fine.]
(;B[kc]C[AB: If Black plays J17 instead, new problems arise for the F16-group (see variation).]
;W[ic];B[ld];W[ke];B[pd]LB[le:A]C[AB: The following moves are interesting, but I think just moving out with 'A' is good for Black.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[nc];B[md];W[qd];B[mf]C[AB: Black has accomplished too little and gave White secure territory.]
;W[oe]TR[kc][ld][md][mc][ne][mf]C[AB: Good aji. The Black stones can be attacked further, they have no eye so far. This must be considered as a success for White.]
;B[of];W[le]C[AB: I'm not so sure about this peep, leave it as a ko-threat. There is no gain here right now. Also, it takes away your own liberties.]
;B[me];W[og]C[AB: Very good!];B[lf];W[je]C[AB: See, now you have to defend (because of the peep)!]
;B[lh];W[nf]C[Malveaux: At this point, I was happy with the game. I seem solid in the upper right and upper center; I feel like my lower left has good chances; I can make more territory attacking the Q4 stone; and I should make some territory by chasing the weak Black group at N15.  Is this assessment accurate?  If yes, then where did I go wrong later?

AB: I also think that White's position is superior. The last move was not really necessary, though. It gains points, but it's a little small. White's D4-group is weak, it is absolutely necessary to defend it (E7). If Black gets the F3 stone out (now would be a good opportunity) the lead may switch. I'm unsure how to handle the Q4 stone, but a 3-3 invasion may not be a bad idea, because all the thickness that Black builds is neutralized by K3 and Q10.]
;B[ih]LB[lj:A]C[AB: The shape is not good. Just 'A' is good.]
;W[fg]LB[di:A]C[AB: Seems a little unimaginative. What about 'A'?]
;B[ik];W[em]C[Malveaux: How well connected are the three Black stones in the center (J9, J12, M12)? How does White go about cutting them off from the left side? I try later at White 86 and 96, but fail.

AB: First, congratulations that you just played the most important point on the board! Black has released pressure from his group by playing 47 and 49. His group is not so weak anymore, you should not try to attack it directly.]
;B[dl];W[jo];B[fk]C[AB: Not a very good move, you should welcome it and play around the Q4 stone. Actually I think now a kakari is better than a 3-3 invasion, because you have good frameworks, especially on the lower side.]
;W[qn]C[AB: Not bad either.];B[np]LB[nq:A][mq:B]C[AB: Should probably be on the third line ('A' or 'B').]
;W[mq]LB[qq:A][oq:B]C[AB: I don't think this is a good move. Black's answer is only natural and it is Black who gains by the exchange 56-57, because you lose the opportunity to play more interesting moves such as 'A' or 'B' later.]
;B[nq];W[kb]LB[on:A][hn:B][ch:C]C[Malveaux: In retrospect, a wasted move; what's better?

AB: Yes, not a very interesting move. 'A' is a simple and good alternative. 'B' plays it safe, but should be considered, because you still have a good lead. If your position was worse, the invasion at 'C' seems possible.]
;B[hn];W[go];B[gn];W[ho];B[fn];W[en];B[fo];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep]
;B[io];W[hp];B[ip];W[hq];B[jn];W[jp]C[Malveaux: By now, I wasn't as happy. I felt like I was letting Black have sente too much; but I'm not exactly sure where I should have played instead.

AB: Well, it looks as if the variation was bad for you, but I think it was ok. You simply could not have expected more, because your stones (E5 and K5) were far apart in the beginning.]
;B[ql]C[AB: Big!];W[pm];B[rp];W[pl]C[AB: Interesting exchange.]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[qo];W[qm];B[ln]
(;W[ji]LB[ml:A]C[AB: It is easy to see why this attack fails, White has no escape route. A premature attack. Entering the left side is good (see variations). 'A' is a simple alternative to increase your framework and reduce Black's center influence.]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[hg];B[lk];W[gi];B[hj];W[fi]
C[AB: The result is not too bad for White.];B[ni];W[kg]C[Malveaux: I should have read this better. Is it too late to cut Black apart?

AB: Black will have no problems to save the majority of his stones (maybe with a small sacrifice). Still, the invasion at C12 is excellent.]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[mg];W[mj];B[mi];W[lj];B[kj];W[li];B[mk];W[nj]
;B[ki];W[nk];B[kf];W[jf];B[jg];W[ig];B[iq];W[ir];B[in];W[gq]
LB[gr:A]C[AB: Leaves some bad aji behind (see variation), maybe 'A' is better.]

(;B[mp]LB[lq:A][lr:B][dh:C]C[AB: Very bad, 'A' or 'B' are much better locally. 'C' is big.]
;W[lq];B[dh]C[AB: Well, now I am not so sure about the White lead anymore (I think you still lead  by 5-10 points).]
;W[ek]C[Malveaux: I'm doubtful of this move. What's better? Is it too late for White? White seems to be 1bout 12 to 15 points behind, right? How'd that happen?

AB: Yes, this point is not so important. I think you still have a small lead. No doubt, D12 was big and helped Black to catch up.]
;B[el];W[ej];B[dk];W[kn]LB[mb:A][cr:B][nr:C][eb:D]C[AB: It seems your endgame needs improvement. This move is not that important. 'A' is big, because it connects your upper side (look at the final position and you see what I mean). 'B', 'C', and 'D' are all big. You got too few of those.]
;B[km];W[lo];B[ko];W[mo]LB[lp:A]C[AB: Not so important, even so 'A' is better.]
;B[ei]C[Malveaux: Oops, I didn't read this either.];W[eh];B[fj]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[nn]C[AB: See, you have to come back to secure the stones instead of making a good endgame move...]
;B[mr]C[AB: ...like this one.];W[lr];B[nr];W[oi];B[lp];W[jr]
;B[mn]C[malveaux [11k\]: i must be making bad shape... spending a lot of time in gote]
;W[no]C[utwig [12k\]: yes
utwig [12k\]: your shape is coming back together now though]
;B[sm];W[sl];B[sn];W[rl];B[ef];W[eg];B[gj];W[fh];B[ff];W[df]
;B[de];W[gg];B[ee];W[gf];B[nm];W[om];B[oo];W[on];B[nl];W[kp]
LB[mb:A][cr:B][eb:C]C[AB: Tiny! 'A', 'B', or 'C' are much bigger.]
;B[lc];W[kn];B[lb];W[ko];B[jb];W[ib];B[ka];W[lm];B[kl];W[ml]
C[utwig [12k\]: now my shape is killing me

AB: You may consider the capture of the four stones a success, but it is not. You played four times a gote move to secure at most ten points, that's 2.5 points per move. No wonder you lost!]
;B[oa]C[malveaux [11k\]: the top edge might have been worth more, i'm not sure
utwig [12k\]: I was just fighting that to get influence to attack the bottom]
;W[na];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[pa];B[fm]LB[dr:A][fb:B]C[malveaux [11k\]: important point

AB: Not as big as 'A' or 'B'...];W[cr]C[utwig [12k\]: it seemed that way]
;B[br];W[co];B[bo];W[dr];B[do];W[bs];B[ar];W[cm]C[utwig [12k\]: ok I'll bite]
;B[dm]C[malveaux [11k\]: :-)
malveaux [11k\]: i'm grasping at straws];W[dn]C[utwig [12k\]: oh good]
;B[co];W[bm];B[cl];W[ap]C[malveaux [11k\]: which doesn't mean it isn't tricky
utwig [12k\]: I'm starting to see that
utwig [12k\]: A4 a good move
malveaux [11k\]: but i think you're a step ahead, because of the weird properties of the corner]
;B[bq]C[utwig [12k\]: we'll see];W[ao];B[bl];W[na]C[Malveaux: A mistake to fight this ko, I think. Black's threats added points, but mine mostly did not. Is E18 the biggest point left?

AB: The ko is not so big, E18 is best.];B[ll];W[mm];B[oa];W[nh]
;B[mh]C[malveaux [11k\]: oops, bad threat
utwig [12k\]: I think so
malveaux [11k\]: gives you double atari !]
(;W[ng]C[utwig [12k\]: one is just a ko though :-)

AB: Even now you should play E18! After the double atari of O13 you protect P12 (see variation). No big deal.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[na];B[if];W[ie];B[oa];W[cs];B[am];W[na]
;B[he]C[malveaux [11k\]: ouch];W[id]C[Malveaux: I captured at J16 rather than H14 in an attempt to minimize White's ko threats; but H14 is better, right?

AB: Yes, after Black G15 you have no good answer (see variation).]

(;B[oa]C[utwig [12k\]: got lots of ko there, but I don't think anything else]
;W[fe]C[utwig [12k\]: or do you see what I don't ?];B[dd]C[malveaux [11k\]: i think if you get two moves there, you reduce me frightfully
malveaux [11k\]: we can look, later];W[ms]C[utwig [12k\]: oh with two moves I think I can take down the whole thing, yes]
;B[ns];W[ls];B[na];W[fa];B[ea];W[ga];B[ia];W[hb];B[po];W[ha]
;B[ja]C[malveaux [11k\]: good game!  i've lost track, but i think you're slightly ahead]
;W[pn]C[utwig [12k\]: lets count it up];C[malveaux [11k\]: close
utwig [12k\]: yes
utwig [12k\]: I thought you had it
malveaux [11k\]: "if only"  :-)
utwig [12k\]: right side looks bigger than left
malveaux [11k\]: deceiving
utwig [12k\]: but mabye I'm crazy
malveaux [11k\]: left side is at least 50 pts
malveaux [11k\]: rt. side is about 40
utwig [12k\]: hmm suppose so
malveaux [11k\]: your corners ended up bigger than i expected
malveaux [11k\]: and i thought i could hurt you more in the center
malveaux [11k\]: i guess i moved too late on it, though
utwig [12k\]: I never know when to move in
malveaux [11k\]: plus, my crummy shape made it too easy for you to reduce me
utwig [12k\]: on bottom yes
malveaux [11k\]: ah, well.  another in a long losing streak for me.  i guess i'd better hit the books some more
utwig [12k\]: how long of a streak?
malveaux [11k\]: in fact, i think i'll send this one to the go teaching ladder
utwig [12k\]: I've heard of that... how does it work?
malveaux [11k\]: about 8 or 10 in a row, now, not counting some even games against someone 3 stones weaker
malveaux [11k\]: go teaching ladder is simple
malveaux [11k\]: send them the game in email; a week or two later,
malveaux [11k\]: you get the game back, with comments from someone abut 5 to 15 stones stonger than you
utwig [12k\]: cool

AB: All together, your game is not too bad at all. In the beginning, you need to pay more attention to your own weaknesses (groups F16 and D4). If Black had explored them better, the game would have turned worse for you. Your endgame needs improvement, but that's normal for your level. You played too many very small moves.  If you have any more questions you can reach me by email: Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com]
