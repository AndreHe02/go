C[Hi.  I am commenting on this game. I'm Jonathan Reece, and about 1k.  My comments are prefaced "JMR".  I shall comment on the moves of Black and White.  White requested the review.

I thought most of White's play was excellent.

The main points to take away are
1  Be aware of the score: when you are ahead play safe; when behind complicate.

2];B[qd]C[Hello, this is a kinda aggresive game with some fight here and there. I would like to know which moves would play a stronger player in these fights. Thanks you.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pj]C[JMR  This is a reasonable move and would be better if there were already a black stone at P16 or 17; it would also be good one place lower, making the space between it and the bottom right corner 5 spaces instead of 6, which makes it harder for W to form a base.  (This would make it 6 spaces above, but there is not an approach move to the top right corner from the right-hand side).]
;W[qo]C[JMR  I think it is more usual to make moves which expand your own sphere of influence before invading, where possible: so I think a move at O17 or P16.  This cannot really be a big mistake though.]

(;B[qn]C[JMR This is bad, and is easy and quick to learn how to improve.  B is attacking W: attack with NON-CONTACT moves.  If you play in contact it makes it easy for W to form sabaki (flexible shape) as it is now W's turn, so very locally he has the advantage out of the 2 stones in contact.  Example sequences forming sabaki follow.]

(;W[po];B[rp]C[JMR  Ouch - this is a bad move: if W plays to separate the 2 black stones at S5, the white stones are at maximum efficiency separating the 2 black stones.  "Do not approach strength" is a simple maxim which is applicable at several levels.  The situation (after W S5) is that Black has 2 weak stones stuck either side of a strong(ish) white group.  The closer you are to strength the weaker you are: these are touching -as close as they can be. See variations.]

(;W[qq]C[JMR  Stylish and nteresting idea.  Although S5 is an obvious move separating black stones beautifully, this has the advantage of the corner.]
;B[qp];W[pp]
(;B[rq];W[oq];B[qr]C[I think the result is not too bad for me here, is it?
I also wanted to play S5, but I tought approching the upper right corner would be bigger.

JMR:  S5 is a place that both want quite urgently.  In my view it is a CLOSE CALL, since the approach at P16 or 17 is big.  

Bear in mind though that one should avoid weak groups in the beginning of the game.  Black could ignore P17, and play S5.  Could you ignore that? The W group would be pretty weak, i.e. a target for getting pushed around to Black's advantage.  It's not very clear: a close call.]

(;W[od];B[nc]C[JMR  Same fault.  A diagonal relationship is ALMOST touching P16.  It's too close to the object being attacked.]
;W[oc];B[pb];W[rd]C[JMR   ! Another stylish and interesting idea.  I'm not sure it should work here, though.]
;B[rc];W[qe];B[re];W[pd]C[JMR  Typically in this situation B has to decide whether to connect at R17, or capture.  If B R17 then W gets an extra kikashi at S14; if he captures then he leaves the atari for W at R17.  Normally one should take one or the other.  In this situation, though, the atari at R17 doesn't help W much, so it seems B is correct to capture.]
;B[sd]
(;W[ob];B[nb];W[oa]
(;B[qb]C[JMR  The W group (top right) is quite strong now.  I think I prefer to take R14, and let W have this point, as it works better with Q10.

Go is "the surrounding game" (and I think the Chinese character for it means that): don't get shut in.]
;W[qf]C[This is very strange. Although I like the result for w again I think I could do much better...

JMR  Yes: W has done well having taken advantage of  B's poor moves at 17 and 19.  I don't think you can do much better: perhaps you are underestimating how much better W's position is than B's, locally and over the whole board.]

(;B[or];W[nq]C[JMR  This exchange (31, 32) makes W stronger; the B group doesn't need making stronger.  So it is better to leave these moves unplayed, and attack White FROM A DISTANCE.  See example.]
;B[rg]C[JMR  2 quite good moves by B.  But the left side of the board is bigger and more urgent.  The right hand side will not make much territory for either side: therefore it is not important.  The black stone at Q10 can either be connected to the bottom, or make shape by threatening to connect to the top right.  It has nothing to worry about.

W has a big lead at this point, and sente.];W[rn];B[qm];W[ro]
;B[rm];W[md]C[JMR  I think this is a good idea, making this not-very-strong group stronger and working well with the top left, and dominating the centre.]
;B[lb]C[JMR  I'm pretty sure that this is a bad move, as the stones plastered up against a strong W wall are almost valueless.  They are 2 POINTS; not a group.  If W covers them they can make a tiny number of points along the top edge, whilst W makes a valuable wall in the middle.]
;W[kc]C[JMR  Exactly.];B[jb];W[kb]C[JMR  Good: hard for B to make any eyes now.]
;B[ka]
(;W[lc]C[JMR  Good];B[mc];W[la]C[JMR  Well read: 45 doesn't work.]
;B[ma];W[na];B[jc];W[ld]MA[mc][nc][nb]LB[nd:A]C[JMR  The empty triange tells you to look for a better shape.  You have appreciated the danger of the cut at 50, but since the marked stones can be captured any time, I would be inclined to play at A.  It's a small diffence though, and sometimes an empty triangle is the best shape.  This way avoids a helpful atari from B on the 3 white stones you just connected, so may be best.]
;B[hc]C[JMR  good shape];W[fc]C[JMR  Good - making territory whilst attacking - just what you want.]
;B[ie];W[gb];B[hb]
(;W[dj]LB[fq:A][jq:B][nr:C][no:D]C[JMR  Good move, co-ordinating well W stones top left and bottom left, and is ready to support putting more pressure on the weak black top group, which only has 1 eye.  (Although it is not very weak: it virtually has an eye, and access to the centre).

My doubts are (a) the weakness of the bottom right W group: a move supporting them would be nice (at A, B, C or D e.g.); and (b) are you missing the opportunity to make a useful presence in the middle whilst attacking the top Black group?  See variation]
;B[fp];W[jq]C[JMR   I like this: attacking left, and extending from the weakish group on the right.  J3 would put more pressure on the black stone, as this gives it room to play at H3 forming a base; but may not be better.]
;B[hq];W[ip]C[JMR  Again: I like it];B[no]C[JMR  Good: taking this key point can only be profitable, as we see over the next few moves.]

(;W[np]C[Here I think I should have played P4

JMR  See my suggestion at N5.];B[oo]C[JMR worth considering the sacrifice still: compare the loss of the W stones on the right with the benefits ...]

(;W[op];B[om]C[JMR  Good.];W[dq]TR[np][op][po]LB[mo:A]C[JMR nice point locally, but I think A is urgent for both sides ("playing at the head of 2 stones" - i.e. when there are also stones in the marked positions).]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[hp];W[in];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq]C[JMR  Now see the importance of N5 for the strength of each group ("playing at the head of 2 stones").]

(;B[pn]C[JMR  See alternative.];W[mo]LB[jp:A][mo:B]C[JMR  This looks to be the first really dangerous move.  You are ahead; this way you split the W stones into 2 weak groups (A and B) whilst Black has about one.]
;B[lo];W[mn]
(;B[kn]MA[ln][jp]LB[ko:A][jo:B]C[JMR  This should be at M6: keep the W stones short of liberties.  W can't play M7 next, as you just capture at N7

If W plays at M6 now, you have to make an empty triangle at A; or if B, then the X-marked points are the eye-stealing tesuji, and the shortage of liberties becomes significant (as in the actual game).]
;W[nm];B[on];W[ln];B[jo];W[ko]C[JMR  now we see B paying the penalty for not playing at M6.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[io];W[ko]
(;B[jn]C[JMR  My first reaction here would be for Black to connect at H5 instead.  Hanging on to small numbers of stones which are plastered up against the completely strong white stones doesn't end well.  Better to make your stones strong instead of leaving that cut.]

(;W[nl]LB[ho:A]C[JMR   This is a very big, important point, but you may have missed the opportunity to cut at A.  If you cut, I don't think B can capture.  With strong W groups on either side this would be the perfect time to cut if you can.  B ends up with 2 weak groups whilst you only have the weak cutting stones.]
;B[jl];W[ok];B[pk];W[ge]C[I thought that one would be sente. Actually I think that if b doesn't respond, a stronger player would be able to kill him.

JMR  It is an important point for Black's shape.  But he then moves out again and is safe.  How useful is the exchange?  Attacking from this side does not gain much as the space you are marking out to the left is invadeable.  Better to attack at J13 and get useful stones on the outside, and then reinforce the top left corner to stop an invasion]
;B[dg]
(;W[id]C[JMR  Better to attack from the outside - non-contact]
;B[jd];W[hd];B[di];W[je]C[JMR  Good];B[ke];W[jf];B[kd];W[kf]

;B[le];W[nd]C[JMR  good];B[lf];W[lg];B[gc];W[fb];B[gd];W[hf]
;B[fd];W[ed];B[fe]
(;W[ff]C[JMR  This direction of play forces B to connect up his 2 weak groups forming 1 strong one.  Consider an alternative to see if it works (see example of separating).]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[de]C[JMR  C16 "at the head of 2 stones" is important: if you play it you save a move, as with your choice you need to go back and cover that point.]

(;W[ce]SQ[cd][de][ee][fd]C[JMR  "Play at the head of 2 stones".  This move leaves that weakness, and you have to waste a move patching up.]
;B[df];W[cc];B[cj];W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[cm];W[cl]C[JMR  Wishful thinking: play the move you need at D7.  Even if B replies at B8, it costs you a liberty.  Splitting Black is not valuable if both groups are strong.]
;B[dm];W[bl];B[em]LB[ho:A]C[JMR  Now you (W) are the one with the weak group, and the aji of the cut at A is gone.]

(;W[fk]LB[ei:A][gl:B][ho:C][ci:D]C[JMR  There are 2 principles to bear in mind in fighting games:
a)  Separate, to make 2 targets;  and
b)  Make your own stones strong BEFORE attacking.

The 2 moves that spring to mind here as a result of these are A and B.  

A separates the 2 weakish W groups, and protects against the cut at C11 (D).  B keeps up pressure on the W group, secures territory and protects against the cut at C.

Consider the effect of W cutting at D (variation).];B[kg]LB[ci:A]
[ei:B]C[JMR  It's a nice point, but I think the cut at A is quite important for both sides.  So how about defending against the cut indirectly by playing at B, which separates the weak stones off?]
;W[jg]
(;B[mg]C[JMR  overly pessimistic, I think: the Black group is quite strong now, and you friends to run towards at K8; and if you thought this was going to be necessary, then you shouldn't have played at L13.]
;W[kh]C[JMR  Now the weak W group on the left is in little danger with this thickness in support.]

(;W[nc]C[JMR  There is certainly the need to make a second eye, but perhaps you can make some useful moves which threaten to do so, before coming back to make sure.  See variation.]
;B[hm]C[JMR Good idea to secure territory and the cut at H5, but how about getting more territory at G8?]
;W[fi]C[JMR  Good move: without the black stone at E11 this effectively joins the weak stones on, and looks like making a bit of territory.]
;B[gg];W[gf];B[fh];W[gh];B[gi]C[JMR  This looks a bit dangerous to me.  How about connecting at E12 first.  See variation]
;W[eh];B[hh];W[ei];B[dh];W[eg]C[JMR  Both sides secure themselves.]
;B[gj];W[ai]C[JMR  Big, but moreso because it threatens Black's eyes.]

[nh:B][ni:C][mh:D]C[JMR  There is 1 eye here already; this does not create 2, so better to play around the marked area (A-D) ... oops, wrong - Black already has a second eye at J18/19, because the black stone at J15 gives a useful atari.

So now look for the biggest move.  Three suggestions are marked with squares.]
;W[bo]C[JMR  Big, and reverse sente.];B[mi]C[JMR  Nice idea to think of attacking the big W group, which still doesn't have 2 eyes, but no-one is going to get much territory around here.]
