C[This was a game between two KGS 10 kyus. I thought the game was closer than the outcome. I would like some help in identifying moves where I should have played a better move.

Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'm about 3k on KGS (as MatCauthon).  I'll be your reviewer today :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]C[Approaching an asymmetrical corner is bigger than approaching a symmetrical one.  White can't get territory here in one move anyway.  It's better to approach the upper left, or make an enclosure in the lower right.]
;W[dn]
(;B[qk]C[Here you left the lower left unfinished.  You should probably complete the sequence.]
;W[nc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[ck]C[Here, I think I should've played E-17. Isn't that joseki?

Yes.  See variation.]
(;B[ed];W[fb];B[ec]C[This move doesn't do anything for you.  You should skip it.]
;W[eb];B[he];W[jc];B[hc];W[hb];B[di];W[ic]LB[jp:a]C[I think you should leave now, and do something at the bottom - either close your corner, or play somewhere around A.  The lower left is still unfinished, too.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[dl]C[Still I think the outcome was alright.]

(;B[ci]LB[jp:a]C[C11 is a waste. I should've closed my lower right corner.

Agreed.  A might even be better.];W[po];B[np];W[pl]
(;B[qh]C[You absolutely can't ignore that move.  See variation.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[qp];B[qq];W[hq]
(;B[fo]C[Here you're creating a weak group.  Why not trade for the corner?]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[ho];B[fm];W[el]C[This is a problem for you - now you'll have a hard time handling the weak group and trying to get territory above.]
;B[gl];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo];B[gp];W[fn];B[gn];W[en];B[go]
(;W[gq];B[dq]C[Great move.];W[cp];B[cq];W[hp]
(;B[je]C[I think you should solidify the upper right before doing something like this.  Territory in the center is usually small and hard to protect.]
;W[gc];B[jl]C[Good tenuki.];W[pb];B[qc];W[ko]LB[ji:a]C[This feels pretty small.  How about A now?]
;B[ek];W[fl];B[fk];W[hm]C[Afterwards, I felt that I should've connected at G7.

I think your move is okay if you're thinking about the center.]

(;B[hl];W[gm]
(;B[hn]C[What does this move get you? It looks like you're trying to separate White, but then you don't finish the job.]
;W[im];B[er]LB[in:a][bp:b]C[Chicken :)  You HAVE to play at A.  Your group in the corner is totally safe, and letting White get A is sente, and lets him connect the groups at the same time.  If you're worried, B is a much better move.]
;W[in];B[bp]C[I suspect you didn't know you were making a trade here, but I think this trade is actually okay.  White's groups are already strong, so the capture is only about points.  He gets ten, but you can ruin more than that with your follow-up.]
;W[fp]
(;B[eq]C[This is terrible - now you give White 10, but you don't take what you have coming to you.]
;W[co];B[br]LB[ji:a][gr:b]C[You still don't need this.  Take sente.  A is still begging to be played.  You have an eye at B any time you need it.]
;W[bo]
(;B[aq]C[This is wimpy again.  See variation.];W[il];B[ik];W[hk]
C[This is where the course of the game changed and I lost it.

I think you're wrong about that.  White gains some ground, but it's not that big.]
;B[gk];W[jk];B[ij];W[kk]
(;B[of]LB[rn:a]C[I don't think this is very big.  See variation.  A is still kind of interesting, too.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[nj];B[oi];W[nl]
(;B[ki]C[At this point, I think you're still doing okay.  You have about 30 in the upper right, 10 in the lower right, 10 in the lower left, and around 30-35 in the center.  White has 10 in the lower right, 35 in the lower left, and 30 or so at the top.

This move isn't big enough because it isn't sente.  See variation.]
;W[rk];B[qj];W[ni];B[oh]LB[rj:a]C[A is bigger, and probably gets sente back.]
;W[ld];B[bf];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]
(;B[ac];W[bc];B[ae];W[ab];B[ad];W[cb];B[bi];W[ak];B[hd]C[This is really small.]
;W[mf];B[kg];W[mk]C[After this, you have to do something about White's territory.]

(;B[rj];W[rl];B[qb];W[sr]
(;B[pr]C[This is a mistake.];W[rs];B[qr]C[This is a bigger mistake.  You're filling in your own eye space.]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[op];B[oq]C[You're dead.]
(;W[no];B[mp];W[mo];B[lq];W[kr];B[qs]LB[nr:a]C[Were you sure you're alive here?  If not, play A and make clear eyes.]

(;W[ms];B[nr];W[lp];B[os]C[Well I'm so far behind now that any corrections I could've made are over. This is the end of my comments.

This sequence is where you lost the game.  You lost a lot of points at the bottom while White finished a giant territory above.

White has about 25 at the top, 25 in the lower left, and 40 in the lower right/bottom.  Black has about 25 in the upper right, 3 at the bottom, 10 in the lower left, and 40 in the upper left.  You're behind by about 18, so it's unlikely that you can catch up, but not impossible.  Both players make a lot of zero point moves from here on.  You might have caught up with a really good endgame.]

[nq][ar][dr][fr][or][as][bs][cs][ds][fs][ps]C[The endgame was pretty simple, so it's unlikely you could catch up after the lower right went so badly.

The main problems I see with this game are not paying enough attention to sente, and being overly defensive.  There were several times where you took gote when it was unnecessary.  Those really add up.  You also played several defensive moves that weren't needed, especially in the lower left.  If you feel you need to defend, you want to try to find a way to do it and keep sente.  You really needed to find time to play a move around O6.  All it takes is one move there, and White loses ten points that he had in the game.
