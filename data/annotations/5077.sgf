C[JN: Hi, I'm playing this game as black and it was played on KGS. There is a fair amount of fighting in this game and I find it interesting.
There are some tactical questions inside - in a few situations I could have done much better.
My comments are preceded by "JN:".
And thanks for the review.

K- hi, I'm your reviewer for today. I'll look through the game, make comments here & there, then make some overall comments at the end. I usually make most of my comments as I step through the game the first time, as if watching the game for real,  although I will go back over the whole game when summing up at the end.

If you have any queries about comments I've made please feel free to get in touch, either by email or on DGS (www.dragongoserver.net, user name 'kester').]
;B[pd];W[do]C[K- interesting opening by white, going  for influence rather than territory]
;B[pp]C[K- nice & balanced opening for black];W[or]C[K- there are a number of reasons why this is not a good move.
1) it is contradictory with white's previous move, which was a move for influence whereas this is a move that is aiming at making territory, however...
2) playing on the 2nd line is not profitable in most circumstances; even making territory along the third line usually is not enough early in the game...
3) even if white takes all of black's lower right corner, it is certainly not the biggest point on the board - the obvious thing to do is take the other corner

So trying to guess what white's plan is, I assume it indicates that he wants to draw you into a fight. This makes me think your comment about there being quite a bit of fighting is based on white continually trying to get you into a fight that he feels he can read out better than you. We shall see if this first impression is true...]

(;B[pn]C[K- good, not being provoked. See variation for a way to take advantage of white's low position on the 2nd line]
;W[qq];B[qp]TR[pn]C[K- I can see why you chose this but it does make these 2 stones overconcentrated with the marked stone above.

This is one of those cases where it is more profitable in the long run to allow white to take territory in the corner but make sure you get something better in return - e.g. a wall as shown in variation a couple of moves earlier, and/or the empty corner]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[pl]
(;B[qj]C[JN: I felt that white move was a too aggressive. Is this the proper way to respond?

K- white's move was on the 4th line so is not particularly strong at making territory. If it had been on the 3rd line, your move would be correct because you are preventing black extending up the right side and making a base.

As his move is on the 4th line, the threat is more likely to be that he tries to run out to the centre and leaves your group with no connection to friendly stones.

See variation for  my suggestion, which as you can see allows white to extend up the right side (you can undercut him later at your leisure) while building strong influence and a bit of centre territory for yourself]
;W[rl];B[oj]TR[pl][rl][pn][pp][qp][rp]C[K- this move is going to make things complicated, because it means that both the marked groups are under threat and will have to run out to find space to connect to friendly stones. White has the advantage because it is his move. Let's see what he does next... I am expecting some kind of jump into the centre from his marked stones]
;W[nl];B[nn]TR[pn][pp]MA[oo]C[K- the "3 corners of a square" shape has a weakness in the middle marked with 'x'. Always check when you make this shape that you can handle it if your opponent plays here (an alternative if in doubt would be to play this stone at O5)]
;W[qn];B[nq]C[K- good];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[dd];W[fc]
;B[df];W[cb]C[K- unusual move; D18 or C17 would be the usual follow up for white]
;B[db]C[JN: Again I found the white move greedy and too aggressive and decided to cut and put some pressure on white here.

K- I agree];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[ae];B[af]
;W[bc]C[K- this worked well for you, your influence should get you more points than white's territory, plus you have sente]
;B[ic]C[JN: was H17 better? or maybe I should play more peacefully here, like N17?

K- your move is spot on; you could have played K17 too; N17 is not the right move because now is the right time to attack white's weak stone

I'm guessing though that you are asking this because you had problems in this area later? we'll see...]
;W[hc];B[id];W[hd];B[if];W[ib];B[jb];W[ia];B[kc];W[he]
(;B[hf]TR[jb][ic][kc][id][pd][if]C[K- up to here you were doing exactly the right thing - all the marked stones are working well together and you can expect to get good territory here.

This move is not right though. You have now decided to go for the kill, whereas you would get more profit by using the group's weakness against it to make profit yourself. 

The way to judge this is as follows: imagine you don't try to kill the white group, instead play a few more moves building a wall out to the centre (see variation). White will do the same because he is fighting for his life (note: you are not in danger here so you don't NEED to kill his group). Now work out the territorial effects. White has little or no territory to the left of the wall, you have large territory to the right.

So I would recommend that you simply connect here with J15]
;W[ie];B[je]
(;W[gf]C[K- maybe white has not noticed how to take advantage here, see variation for how he can severely reduce your gains in the top right area of the board]
;B[gg];W[ff]
(;B[fg]C[JN: see variation];W[ee];B[de];W[ed]C[JN: I was glad about this sequence. Black is better here I guess, despite the two cutting points at H13 and K14.

K- I agree. And since it is black's move you could play something like K13 to protect them both, which although gote would be a huge strategic point]
;B[eq]C[K- this is always a difficult thing to decide: where is the biggest point on the board?

I would suggest K13, but you might consider C8 as an alternative, to make territory on the left side.

The move you played leaves you open to a splitting attack around H3 - pincering your single stone and beginning a subtle attack on your stones in the lower right]
;W[cr]C[K- ...but it appears white is more concerned with keeping the corner]

(;B[cq]C[K- you're right, this is a weak spot you can exploit, but I would question whether are making the right decision overall.

This move will start a reasonably messy fight in the corner. I think your best interest is better served by keeping things simple, trying to wall white into the corner - your walls would work well with your stones in top left & bottom right.

See variations for possible examples];W[dr]
(;B[er]C[JN: I should have connected, yes?

K- possibly, although you have the beginnings of a wall which would work well along the bottom side]
;W[dq];B[dp];W[cp];B[ep];W[bq];B[eo];W[dn];B[cl]C[K- you have a good wall, L3 would be better here to make profit from it

The move you played is good but you need to play it later once the bottom is settled]

[oo][mp][np]C[K- the marked group is short of eye space - you have one eye ok (in one of the points marked x) but you need to make space for a second]
;W[qf]
(;B[qd]C[JN: I did not want to let white grab the corner. White is very weak here - the invading stone is weak and the Q8 group is weak as well. But I did not manage to use this properly. I should be able to kill both those groups probably. How to do this strategicaly? Should I attack the lower group now to strenthen the P10 group first and than kill the invading stone(s)?

K- I think you cannot stop white getting something here. Problem is, as you have not played at K13 (or something like it), white has 2 options: make life in the corner or run out. As with any invasion, if the invader has 2 ways out it is unlikely that the defender can prevent both.

Regarding the groups lower down the right side - the white Q8 group is indeed weak but so is the black Q6 group. If you attack the white group from above, the lower black group will come under pressure and you will be fighting on 2 fronts which is likely to end in some loss for you.

Your best strategy here is to let white into the corner I'm afraid; the trick is to minimise his gain - i.e. wall him in. See variations.]

K- no you could not kill it. But strategically you got the better end of the bargain - it was important that you confined white  into the corner, which you have]

K- definitely];B[qg];W[eg]
(;B[qf]C[JN: a big mistake. letting white kill now was not important. More important was cutting at E14 and later connect at S15.

K- correct about E14. You can save S15 for later, keep white on the defensive by keeping the R14 ko going a while longer]

C[JN: an attempt to kill the white stones. It turned out all wrong. M6 better here?

K- there's 2 problems here.

Strategically, you have a weak group here too so you must be careful. The general advice is, attack from the direction where you are weak - meaning, use the fact that you are attacking to strengthen stones that are weak, and push the defending stones towards your strong stones.
 
Tactically, this shape has a weakness at N7 which white will probably try to exploit, particularly as this would also mean he threatens your lower group. As always, if you have to split your efforts between 2 purposes then you are unlikely to achieve both.

M6, N6 & N7 are all good alternatives, although none are likely to kill the white group.]

K- a very interesting game. As it turned out there was not as much fighting as I thought there might be, but there was plenty of good strategic play (particularly from black).

I think in summary you did a good job of building influence early in the game, which later put you ahead in territory to such an extent that white's success in killing a large group wasn't enough to win him the game (losing a group of his own didn't help of course!).

I would suggest you keep 2 things in mind from this game:

first, when your opponent invades take a strategic view of what you want to achieve and what you think you have to concede to the invader. For example, if the invader has 2 ways to succeed (e.g. 2 ways to make life) it is unlikely that you can concede nothing. In this game, the top right corner was a good example. White invaded & could either make life or connect outwards (there are the 2 options) so you had to give him something. The correct decision was to allow him to make a small live group but make sure that he was walled in in the process, so you got the rest of that quiadrant as territory.

second, look out for eye space. The large group you lost was short of eyespace from very early on. You had plenty of time to save it but because  (I guess) the threat was rather diffuse it didn't register on your radar as needing to be saved.

Hope this review is helpful. As I said at the start please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss any of the points I have made.]
