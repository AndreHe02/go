;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[Normally it is better to play in an empty corner rather than approach an opponents corner.]
;B[qo];W[pp]C[I wouldn't have chosen this response to the attachment.  You need to end with the move in order to play in the empty corner, and I don't see how that can happen and still get full value from your stones.]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[pn]C[At this point, black has 10+ points of territory while white has a thick wall.  That would be OK, execpt that it is black's move, and whites wall doesn't work very well because of the Q2 stone.]
;B[cd];W[ed];B[ee];W[fe];B[de];W[ec]C[It might be better to make the hanging connection at G16 rather than E17.]
;B[dc]
(;W[eb]C[I think this move is too small.   All it threatens is to reduce blacks corner by a few points.  If I were black I would respond with C10, extending down the side.  C10 is a point that both sides want to play because it is an extention from the corner.  If white gets there first, then the wall near Q5 is more valuable.]
;B[db]C[Black shouldn't respond here. It is too small.];W[nc]
;B[lc]
(;W[ne];B[le]C[I think black should play Q14 or Q13.  M15 gives white a chance to enclose the corner, which is almost always a good thing to do.]

;W[dj]C[This is good for white.  D10 or C10 has been a big move for both players for several moves.]

;B[cg];W[bh];B[bg];W[di];B[eh];W[gf];B[fg];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm]
;B[so];W[qi]C[This move seems a little small to me.  K18 seems like a bigger point, and is probably forcing.  If black ignores it, white can play O18 and connect out.]
;B[qg];W[qe];B[pe];W[rg]
(;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[qj];B[li]C[This exchange looks good for white to me.  White got 10 points and black got 10 points, but it is white's move to take K18.  Black gave up the move and didn't get anything for it.]
;W[jg]C[This is much too small.  At best it protects 4 points of territory.  K18 is really big now.]
;B[kg];W[kf];B[lf];W[kh];B[lh];W[lg];B[mg];W[kn]C[This point is valuable, but I think K18 is bigger.  It threatens to invade blacks big area and secures territory for white.  The L6 move just secures some territory.]
;B[io];W[kl]C[This move is really small.  K18 is still a very big point.  I think whoever plays there first will win.]
;B[pj];W[ok]C[This invites black to reduce either the side or the center.  Was it supposed to be at Q9? That would make more sense.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[ol];B[qm];W[rl];B[oj];W[om];B[jb];W[fn]
;B[jr]C[Black should run out into the center.  This move lets white seal off more territory while black gets nothing.]
;W[kr];B[hr];W[or];B[ms]C[Doesn't work.]
(;W[ps];B[qr];W[qs];B[rs];W[os];B[rq];W[ks];B[ic]C[This is small now.  F10 would be better.]
;W[fj]C[Very big.   White is now leading, due to blacks errors.  If I were playing, I would try to start the end game as soon as possible.]
;B[im]
(;W[gh]C[A little small. Lets count.  Black has about 25+ points in the upper right center, 8 points in the lower right, about 20 in the upper left, and maybe 5 in the lower center.  Maybe a total of 60.

White has about 20 in the right, about 25 in the bottom center, and about 35 on the left. That gives white a total of about 80, or a 20 point lead.  It is time to start the endgame.

A13 looks like the biggest endgame point to me, since it is sente for both sides.]

White's biggest problem in this game seems to have come from not counting the score.
