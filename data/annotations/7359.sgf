C[Dear reviewer.
This is a game played on KGS. I play black. I lost, but don't know why. So I would like advice on most areas of the game, and I also want to know what went wrong, and where I lost the game.
Thank you.];B[qd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[jq];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc]

;B[pk];W[pm];B[qj];W[nl];B[hq]C[Is it wrong to save this stone now?

klin: No.  But, H3 could play at J4.  If W cuts, H3, then H4, giving up the stone.]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[ip]C[klin: Now B's position is low.];B[kr]C[klin: B L2 not good.  F3 is the key point.]
;W[fq]C[klin: After W F3, B is painful.];B[lr]C[Should black push at H4 first instead?

klin: B H4, W H5, B can only G4: very bad shape.];W[hp];B[cm]
;W[co];B[dj];W[eg];B[ch]C[klin: B C12 could play at E14, then D 13 try to get a sente to play at O13.  These few moves, B pretty much follows W's moves.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[pe];B[qe];W[oh];B[nj]C[klin: B O10 should O9, W has no time to play at K15.]
;W[je];B[gi]C[I felt I had to do something about that large moyo, but then I don't know what that should be.

klin: W's upper part will not grow too much.  B can attack W from N6.  When W tries to contact with the top part, B can enter.  However, B has a weak point at Q11.  that's why B O10 was not a good move.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[mi];W[lh];B[mh];W[mg];B[li];W[kh];B[ln]
C[klin: M6 another bad move.  B has inested in M11, should N7 direct attack for kill.  If W eventually escapes, B has G3 to threaten the lower W group and gain some terriroty.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[qm];B[qk];W[ok];B[oj];W[qp];B[rq];W[ll];B[jl]
C[klin: B has another weak poin at N6.  The attack will not be effective.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[kn]C[klin: B basically chase W back home.  W should say: "Thank you."]
;B[em];W[hm];B[gl];W[fh];B[gr];W[gq];B[hr];W[bn];B[bm];W[fi]
;B[fj]C[klin: B center is samll.  If this the the gain of attacking B, the reward is too small.  At this point, B should give up center and play at E2.  W has a hard time to stop B's advance.  B at least gets a sente.

Next big move will be F18 or O18.

klin: The reason for loss?  the attack of the right side ends up no gain.  B played at H11, M11 that helps W secure the its territory; then, plyas K8, K7 to send W home.  Look at the end game, how many points B gets in the center?  In addition, W plays a much better endgame then B.  It could have been closer.

klin: No comments beyaond this point.];W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[ek]
