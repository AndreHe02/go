C[Hello,

I played B in this game. Score does not matter here (-0.5).

I am mostly concerned by shape in the chuban where :

- I could have made better shapes
- I could have impaired W shapes

Also, comments in the yose will be appreciated.

B13 is not good, it make your liberty tight. Normally you should play at "A"]

Why? if your opponent play at H3, you will not get good result because around White is strong.]

Maybe];W[ck];B[dk];W[ch];B[ci];W[cg];B[df];W[eh];B[bb];W[eg]
