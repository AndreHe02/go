C[I'm a beginner player. Since 6 months I read some books about of go and this is my first game.
I revised this game and I have see a lot of mistakes.
I played this game a 2 AM and I have few tired but that is not an excuse; soo I have few nervouse.

If you feel that there are more important issues to concentrate upon, I'll welcome the guidance.

Thanks very much.

;B[cp];W[qg];B[pj];W[ri]C[FR: There are more important places on the board. Too early]
;B[ck];W[jd];B[jp];W[qk];B[ol]C[FR:  Looks a bit strange but seems to be quite good]
;W[ql];B[cf]LB[de:A][df:B]C[FR: "A" or "B" look more natural to me to counter White's influence.]
;W[df]
(;B[bh]TR[jd]LB[dg:A][de:B]C[FR: Very low. White is starting to get a nice wall that works perfectly with the marked stone. I would play "A" or "B" to get the chance to break through the wall.]
;W[bg];B[bf]LB[cg:A]C[FR: Better to cut at "A"];W[cg];B[ag]
TR[bh]C[FR: The marked stone is more or less dead, so making a connecion to it  is not going to help.]

;W[ci];B[bj];W[qn];B[on];W[ro];B[rp];W[so]C[FR: On the first line this early in the game is wrong most of the times. As it is here.  There are lots more important moves, like expanding the moyo or invading on the lower  edge.]

TR[pj][ol]C[FR: Should be at "A". Don't break a row of stones like that with the  marked stones in place.]
;W[oj]
(;B[pk]C[FR: You are trying to save one stone. Give it up and instead close your wall!]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[oi];B[mh];W[qj]LB[mk:A]C[FR: Way too small. White should play at "A" to push through.]
;B[mk]C[FR: good!];W[of];B[mc];W[nc];B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[ic]
;B[jb]LB[nb:A][lc:B][qc:C]C[FR: Too defensive. White is destroying your shape and you are too small too  survive there without a nice shape. "A" or "B" look more promising, especially  as "A" threaens an invasion at "C"]

[ja][jb][kb][lb][jc]C[FR: "A" would kill the marked stones]
;B[pc]C[FR: good probe ...];W[pb]LB[qc:A]MA[qb][pd]C[FR: wrong answer. "A" was necessary here to protect/connect the marked stones.]

(;B[nf]LB[kd:A][la:B]C[FR: now a very interesting variety is "A". Watch the variants! (but assume that  White still doesn't see "B")]
;W[qe]C[FR: Why this?];B[ng]C[FR: equally unnecessary!];W[oa]
;B[na]C[FR: not necessary];W[pa]C[FR: a 1 point gote play! Way too small...]
;B[jf];W[ke]C[FR: finally that cut gets protected.];B[la]C[FR: and that one too :-)]
;W[oq];B[or]LB[jq:A]C[FR: If you really want to answer down there, play around "A"]
;W[be];B[af];W[ae];B[ah];W[cj];B[bl]LB[dk:A][cl:B]C[FR: "A" is better. The cut is not very dangerous. Or play "B" if you feel it needs  some protection]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[ei]LB[ek:A]C[FR: "A" is better.];B[el];W[ih]
;B[jh]LB[ik:A]C[FR: You are protecting territory that is just 2-3 wide. It is better to protect the lower  huge area by plaing around]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[if]C[FR: White profits from those two new walls]
;B[nq]C[FR: not necessary.];W[ji];B[ki]LB[ii:A]C[FR: A cut is necessary here. Don't forget Black is strong below!]

C[FR: That hole did not need any closing. If you want to play there later, "A" would be better.]

(;B[dr]LB[bp:A]C[FR: "A" looks better as it crushes the groups base.]

(;B[co]LB[bo:A]C[FR: this finally looses the game. "A" should still have killed the group.]
;W[bo];B[aq];W[bn]C[FR: this looks wrong ...]

;W[fp];B[fq];W[tt];B[pg];W[qi]LB[bq:A]C[FR: the game is not over :-) What both of you missed is "A" for Black...
It kills the white group since White can not attack the two stones  from either side! So White should have defended at "A".   Just two tips for both of you:  - Think twice about defending single stones or small groups of stones. Maybe    there is something more important on the board.
- Don't be afraid to cut once in a while. Sometimes the risk of the situation  being hard to calculate is outweighed by some definite disadvantages of not  cutting.  Good luck in your future games!]
