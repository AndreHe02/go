C[Hello, first and foremost thanks for taking the time to review my game.  I thought I played very well, its an even game vs a friend of mine who is 9kyu on KGS (I myself am 12kyu, but I think Im slightly better than that) regardless, its a very nice game where I suffer a loss of .5 moku.  Its chinese scoring, 7.5 komi for white and I feel I played very well, and I'd like some advice for the future, and on this game in particular.  If you could somewhere summerize how you feel about my playing (too agressive, too passive, etc) and point out where specificaly I could have done a lot better.



Thanks!

;B[pd];W[cp];B[qp];W[dc];B[ce]C[I thought I'd start the game off by being agressive, 7.5 komi felt like so much and I decided early to play agressively and fight hard for territory.  Was this Kakari too early or premature?  I didn't want him to take any free points, and a kakari on the bottom left felt slow to me for some reason.

* I don't see a problem with this kakari.  It really depends on your style of play.  A wedge around c10 or completing your shimari are also perfectly reasonable plays.]
;W[ed]LB[dg:A][ch:B]C[I didn't really know anything about this move so I just took it in stride and make a 2 point jump, is there a better response?

* This move is Shuusaku's kosumi.  It's a strong move and keeps you from pressing white down.  A and B are both fine responses.  You should avoid the temptation to continue by attacking from the other side, as white will pincer and you'll have two weak groups to take care of.  I'll go ahead and show you some joseki for each. (See variations)]

(;B[ch]LB[jc:B][cd:A][dg:B][ch:A]C[* This avoids some potential complications with the keima at d13.  White's main follow-ups are at A and B.]

;B[cf];W[dg]
(;B[ck]LB[jc:B][ck:A]C[* This move is a bit slow, leaving white to take his extension.]
;W[kc]C[* This was a bit oversealous perhaps.  I prefer k17 or an approach at o17 in this position.]
;B[mc];W[id];B[qj]C[Since my two stones on top were facing this way, I just made a light extension.  Should I have tried to keep the initiative by attacking his lower left stone, or was this move fine?  Would the 4th line have been better?

* This wasn't a bad move by any means.  You do, however, have a LOT of low stones at this point.  Perhaps you should have played elsewhere for the time being.  I like e4 for this position.]
;W[jp];B[eq]LB[qe:B][oq:A]C[I  didnt want him to have territory hwere (as it is quite large) so I did the kakari knowing it would be an uphill fight.  Should I have just made a large knights move from my lower right stone, or was this ok?

* I don't like this move right now.  I think that white is far too thin for you to worry about it being solid territory, and you have some better moves (such as A or B) which do give you very solid territory.  What's more, A works well with your R10 stone to build a right side moyo.]
