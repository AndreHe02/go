C[Dear reviewer, thank you in advance. This game has been played recently on Dragon Go Server. I'm around 18 kyu and my opponent probably also. I'd like to have some advice about the begin and mid game. Any thoughts about this game are welcome.

CJT - An interesting game to review - thanks.

I think the main thing you need to work on is invasions - both attacking and defending. You lost a significant number of points in your defense of move 37, and your own invasion of 50.

Invasions aren't exactly my forte either, so try to read out some variations that I didn't come up with.

I've made some general comments as I saw good/bad moves, but generally I've not commented on the endgame - except for one large kill you missed ;-) - just tthe opening and mid-games.

I hope you find this review helpful, and feel free to send me any thoughts/questions about my review.]

(;W[ep];B[fp]C[CJT - This is such an obviously good move for black, that you should have tried to get ahead with 28 to reduce it's power.]
;W[fo];B[hp]TR[hq]LB[ip:a][iq:b]C[CJT - Now the marked stone is under pressure. A is big for white, and B is big for black]
;W[nc];B[pg];W[pb];B[qc];W[kd]LB[qj:a]C[CJT - This sequence went well for W - to get a good moyo at the top. White should be aiming now at an invatsion arounnd A to prevent black getting an even bigger moyo on the right.]
;B[dl]
(;W[cl]LB[cj:a][dj:b]C[CJT - Black 37 is awkward to handle - usually with thickness you could play A or B - but here black is strong at the top and would fight well with B or A...

However, the contact play you chose was probably not the best option - contact plays are rarely the best attacking moves.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[ck];W[bl];B[dk]
(;W[cn];B[em];W[dn];B[fn];W[en];B[fm]C[CJT - Look back to the position after move 36 - white was quite thick, but only comes out here with about 10 points of territory, while black is now the one with great central influence.

Play through a few variations of how to handle move 37 - and try to get a feel for which moves work for a) making territory and b) making thickness. My thought is one option, but I'm sure there are better moves too!]

(;W[qi]LB[qj:a]C[Here I thought that I was behind, so I placed my stone in his territory, but it did not go too good.

CJT - I agree that the invasion is a good idea - though perhaps trying to settle the H3 stone is good too.

You chose a good spot for invasion - although perhaps one line lower (A) would make the pincer slightly less effective]
