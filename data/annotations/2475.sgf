;B[pp]MA[qd][pd][qc]C[I played white in this game.  I've noticed that my focus seems a bit off of what I should be doing.  My main question is should I be focusing more on the corners and sides and less on fighting?  I also seem to let my opponent grab alot of territory whilst I end up needing it in the center, and not getting it. Also any comments on shape and direction would be alot of help.

Hi, I'm around 12k* on IGS so take what I say with a grain of salt.  I'll comment on both sides and try to take a fundemental approach.  I'll let my comments be preceeded by a ** for simplicity.

**Here Black plays lower right.  For considerate play the marked corner is played first.  On a real board, white will then not have to reach across for first response.]
;W[dd];B[dq]MA[cp][pc]LB[do:a][co:b]C[** For the 3-4 move, it is made in the X spaces from a 4-4 so that white won't have a great approach move at A or B.]
;W[pd];B[co];W[do]MA[jd][jq]TR[mq][gq]C[Ok... well yeah.  I have no Idea where this came from.  would K4 have been good? or mabey and aproach on Q4 somewhere?

** This is not a good approach move.  Generally play the X spots.  On K-3 this is done so one can extend two points either way and have an optimal base.  At K-16 it is done to make a nice moyo.

You're approach can only end badly for now.];B[dp];W[dn];B[ck]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[fo];B[gq];W[ch]MA[bm]C[** Very hard to attack C-9 as it can connect at X.  Plus your D-6 group is not settled so will come under pressure after the outcome.]

(;B[cl]C[Bad play in my opinion. This allows white a nice comeback.  See variation.]
;W[el];B[bn];W[qg]MA[jd][dj]C[K-16 looks better.  Also,  D-10 seems important to connect your weak group while at the same time closing in Black.]
;B[jc];W[gc];B[mc];W[qn]C[Looking at this now, Is this on the wrong side? Mabey try and wedge? How might that work? Or is it even a good Idea?

** It is good.  If black pincers, take the corner.  Or play normally if black does.]
;B[qk]C[** Pincer looks bad here as black played between your two stones.  This can make for a nasty fight.  Tread carefully.]

(;W[pl]C[should I jump to P6 first or is this a descent attack?  

**  One either sets up a base or escapes to the middle.  Here you don't have the resources for a strong attack.  See variation.]
;B[ql]MA[pj][np]C[** Either would be better.  One escapes, the other protects the corner from a pincer.]
;W[pm];B[qi];W[ok];B[nq];W[lq]MA[oi][ph][oh]C[** Surround that one group.  Don't make a weak one for yourself.]
;B[jq];W[lo];B[qc]MA[qg]TR[mc][jc]C[Should I have played P17 instead of R6?

**  Thanks to the triangled stones, this makes for a tough call.  You need sente to play P-12 to block then S-10 to harrass.  I say Q-17 to make three small black groups.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[se];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[ra]
;W[rc]C[** Bad, this is a ko play as black is alive.  Plus, you to protect the cut at P-15.]
;B[rd];W[sc];B[sb];W[oe];B[rp]C[** Ok, now sit back and look at the board.  Black is concentrated on the 3rd line.  You have sente  but no guarenteed territory.  The corner still can be invaded at C-17.  Start playing capping moves to limit black's approach to the center.  Then protect the corner.]
;W[nn]MA[oi][ei][jo][le][id]TR[cd]C[** Any of the marked spaces are better.  Your two stones are safe as it have three avenues to escape.]
;B[hb]MA[jo][oi][me][ie][cc]C[** Black needs to escape to the center.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[he]C[** White should thank black.]
;B[df]C[** Very greedy invasion. It has no backup.]
(;W[fe]C[**slack.  Push black toward your strength.  See variation.]
;B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[gg]C[** Black has made a weak group in the center, keep it seperated.]
;W[gf]MA[di][dj][ig][oi][me]C[I did this for shape. Would H J OR K14 have been bettter?
Maybe H or J 13?

**  Bad.  There is no way to seperate this black group now.  All the marked spaces limit damage.  Black looks way in the lead now.  Territory in the center in slimming down.

Also, when you touch a stone, it usually results in plays that make it stronger.]
;B[gh];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig]C[** Your wall is facing the wrong way.]
;B[je]C[** Bad, black still needs to take center despite his lead.]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[kf];B[pj];W[oj];B[oi];W[mg];B[ni];W[ph];B[pi]
;W[le];B[ld];W[me];B[gk]C[** This move makes black unbeatable.  I'll reserve further comments on obvious misplays from now on.  Game approaches the endgame.]

;W[gp];B[fp];W[ep]C[if he would have responded at J5 here I would be cut in two.  Is this play to risky?

** No, black lost that stone for no purpose.  If he replied here at J-5 he risks the bottom stones in the next variation.]

C[Ok it seems this play is way to small and I know hoping for a mistake is NOT the way to play go.]
;B[nr];W[ls];B[lk]C[I can't help but feel M8 or L9 would have been better for him.]

;W[jk];B[qa];W[cc];B[qh];W[tt]C[** Good game.  You stayed connected but you have to be aware of territory.  Neither went all out to kill groups which made for safe play (with none of those silly endgame kills you see so often in 20+ kyu games)..  At the end of the middle game you both made mild moves when big ones were still out there but this will solve itself in time when you begin to count more.  At the end, look for moves that demand responses and make all of those first.  Despite reducing, black had such a lead it did not matter.  Still a good show.

Enjoy and keep playing.
