AB[dp][pd]C[Hi,

thanks for your help. I am playing with the black stones and need some advice on how to improve my play. In this game I was more than 50 (?) points behind and only lost because of a stupid mistake of white.

There are some questions in this file (especially after move 92) - but please also point out the mistakes I didn't recognize.


Hi, I am reviewer and hopefully I can help you out Please feel free to email me back with any questions]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cf];B[fc];W[qf];B[nd]C[Is it better to play R12?

This move is used to make influence on the left side and doesn't seem to be a part of your game plan so r12 is probably better]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[C10 or D10 might be a better choice to attack both stones at the same time]
;W[cj];B[el];W[en];B[fq];W[ej];B[gl];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[Do I need to answer with C2?

The short answer is no.

Normal defense would be b1 and right now it might be a bit to small the approach on the lower right corner could be bigger than b2. B2 also makes white a bit weaker since it limits his base but white can conect to the c10 stones if need be at the moment. If White plays c2 or b2 continue with j3.]
;B[qh];W[qj];B[oh];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc]C[Here it's the same question: Do I need to react to S17?

See the varation It really doen't put a lot of pressure on white but it claims part of the corner]

(;B[qb];W[rg]
(;B[jd]C[Maybe should of been at s12];W[iq]C[Now I get problems with my D3 group? How to defend it? Or should I run away?

Play b2 to defend and secure your base on the left side then you would jump towards the center. Attacking isn't bad option here by sealing white in.]

(;B[kq]C[This is a bit of an overplay];W[io];B[nq];W[oq];B[np]

;B[ln];W[jo];B[lm];W[jh];B[ig]TR[hl][hm][hn][il][jh][ji][jj]
[jk][jl]C[It doesn't look very well for black: Some territory in the upper part of the board, but white has secure territory in der lower left and some points in the upper right and a lot of potential on the right side.

What is a plan for black to play? Attack the lower right corner? Or try to make territory around M14? Or around M3?


I would attack whites weak group marked, maybe first creating a wall on the left side by attacking the R10 stone.]

(;B[jf]C[This is a tad bit agressive black is in a weak position too with this move.]

C[From now on I play without a plan. I only try to catch his K10 group - but this is impossible, he white needs only 4 moves to kill my lower left stones.

There is space in the right side to attack. One thing go will teach you is to let go of a loosing battle. There is no purpose in attacking alive stones.]
;W[nf];B[lg];W[oj]C[Here white kills a lot of your opportunity]

White having the lead at this point you have to do something desperate or resign.]

Yes You lost about 40 points in exchange for that influence and strengthed whites corner, my guess it was a loss of about 20 points]

You got very lucky here, I would say work on couting and when your behind fight like a wild crazy man and complicate the game.]
