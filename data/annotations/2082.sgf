AB[dd][pp][dp][pd][jj]C[I am particularly interested in comments on the opening. I have recently progressed from 6 handicap to 5 handicap against John, and this obviously required a different approach on the opening. Thanks.]
;W[cn]C[Comments by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 3 dan. October 2002.]
;B[dj];W[jq];B[co];W[dn];B[fq];W[nd];B[pf];W[cf];B[ek]TR[co]
[dp]LB[bj:a][fd:b][fj:c][jd:d]C[EE: The first slightly dubious move. It is a bit slow-footed. Playing two stones so close makes Black a lot stronger here, but compared with the marked stones which makes the same shape, the stones here are not so close to white stones, so they may get overconcentrated. Black's problem is e.g. how to make good use of #10 when White plays 'a' now or later.

'b', 'c' and 'd' are quicker, simpler, alternatives.];W[gn]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[hc];B[kd];W[if];B[le]LB[kf:a]C[EE: Again, 'a' would be quicker.]
;W[nf];B[id]LB[kg:a]C[EE: This is a preparation for cutting. Cutting works best if it leaves the opponent with two groups which he can't afford to give away.

Jumping to 'a' feels more natural. White is separated in many weak groups.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[gf];B[hg];W[fe]TR[hc][cf]C[EE: White is not unhappy about sacrificing one stone (which still has aji) since he is able to connect the two marked stones. He made good use of the leverage of the contact fight.]
;B[cc];W[jf]C[EE: Maybe W is taking on a bit too much here. B's reply is obvious and good. It is only a 5 stone game, so no need to panic yet. :-)]
;B[lg];W[jh];B[gg];W[fg]LB[fh:a]C[EE: This exchange does more for White's shape than Black's (B still has only 3 liberties). You only play like this if you want to follow it up with 'a'.]
;B[oh]LB[ph:a]C[EE: 'a' would be the same idea, but better (explained soon).]
;W[nh];B[li]TR[oh]LB[ph:a]C[EE: This was the logical and expected consequence of P12. But suppose the marked stone wasn't played, and that it was Black's move now. In that case you wouldn't play there, but rather at 'a', right? That shows the drawback of P12.]
;W[oi];B[mg];W[ng];B[ni]C[EE: This is the way to save the face of P12, but it gets complicated.]
;W[pg];B[pi]LB[ph:a]C[EE: 'a' immediately, don't strengthen W unnecessarily.]
;W[oj];B[ph];W[qg]TR[oj][pi]C[EE: Without the marked exchange, you would have a ladder at P10 now.]
;B[qk]C[PM:
I was concerned about how jumbled everything was looking and wanted to do
something with the bottom right.    JC:

EE: Yes, you can't afford to let the three stones go. The corner has to manage.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[og];B[qi];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob]LB[rf:a]C[EE: Now Black should play 'a' first.]
;B[pb];W[re];B[rc]LB[rf:a][rg:b][rd:c]C[PM: I felt these were looking a little dead, but I wanted to maximise the aji from them and also get sente.

EE: With the a-b exchange, 'c' would work well. Even without a-b I think 'c' gives B the best chances of survival.]
;W[rd];B[rb];W[qa];B[pa];W[sc];B[mq];W[qn];B[pl];W[on];B[lo]
LB[nl:a]C[EE: It seems easier to jump out at 'a' which immobilises W's three stones.]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[ok];B[jo]LB[nm:a]C[EE: Keeping W separated with 'a' is more urgent.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[oq];W[mk];B[lj]LB[rl:a]C[EE: White 'a' is starting to become a serious concern for B.]
;W[gq];B[kl]C[PM: I really didn't want white to play here!]
;W[nm];B[rl]C[PM: Time to get two eyes.];W[ro];B[pm];W[po];B[qm]

(;W[nq]C[JC:
This attempt to attack failed and I later lost the group. Had I just made
a life (eg variation1), with the top right corner looking dead, 77 unanswered
and the left side promising, then thing might have gone easier for me.

EE: Yes, but it didn't die due to mistakes now, but due to mistakes later.]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr]
;B[rq];W[rm];B[pk];W[qp];B[qq];W[op];B[jb]LB[fp:a]C[PM:
I wasn't sure if bottom right was alive, but I felt some real big moves were
still around, so I really wanted sente.

EE: This is not big in terms of territory. And playing around 'a' is more urgent.]
;W[ii]C[PM: I had not seen this threat at all...];B[gi];W[hj]
;B[fo]C[PM: I think this was probably a bad move.];W[fn];B[pq]
C[PM:
Things having gone bad in the centre, I wanted to attack these white stones...
if not kill them, at least get some thickness around the centre.]
;W[rp];B[rr]C[EE: The corner is okay without this move.];W[gj]
C[PM: My attack would have to wait.];B[fh];W[eg];B[ei];W[fj]
;B[em];W[en];B[hl]LB[dh:a]C[PM:
I did not read this move properly. I thought this was good shape, but did
not allow for white stones either side.

EE: Yes, the closer the opponent's stones are, the tighter you have to play. 'a' looks like another good attack, on the upper W group and protects some weaknesses at the same time.]
;W[gl];B[gk]C[EE: As you already figured out, pursuing this only makes it worse.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[hk];B[gm];W[hm];B[gk];W[il]C[PM:
I had mis-read this, I thought it was a ko, not a double atari. Oh well :)]
;B[gl];W[in];B[ik];W[jk]C[PM:
Again, did not see this. Things looked real bad in the centre now. Time to
return to my attack on the right.];B[kk];W[ij];B[pn];W[sn];B[sp]

(;W[kn]C[JC:
I was trying too hard to weaken the black group stretching accross the centre,
and with that aji just to the left!

Playing this move at N6 seems to produce a second eye, just. Thats the weak point black hits later.

EE: Yes, just about life. But as White, it is tempting to try to live in a more active way.]
;B[ko];W[km];B[jm]C[PM: Thought I saw a chance to improve things in the centre...]
;W[jn];B[jl];W[im];B[ik];W[ej];B[dk];W[di];B[dh];W[ci];B[ho]
C[PM: G8 group looks like their going down. Thought I'd best use them while I could.]
;W[hn];B[mn]C[JC:
I can't see a way out now.];W[lm];B[nn]C[PM: I think white overlooked this,
but not sure what else he could have done.



JC: Yes.];W[cq]C[PM: Uh oh

JC: Having lost a group I look around for something really aggressive to do.

EE: But you have yourself taken a good grip on the left side, so there is no need to be desperate. W has 30 in TR, 60+ in the left and a few points at the bottom if he makes life there. B has 50 in the BR and a bit over 10 in the top left and less than 20 in the BL, so if W stays clam, he should win.]
;B[fr]C[JC: I'd've been better off playing here or soewhere close with my last move.]

(;W[io]C[JC: see variation2];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[go];B[gr];W[fp]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[bo]C[EE: Now when the dust has settled we see that B has secured the whole bottom and the game doesn't look so good for W anymore.]
;W[bn];B[oa]C[PM:
This was a bad move. I thought this worked with move 102 (K18), but I didn't
see I was causing trouble for that centre black group.];W[mb]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[ch];W[eh];B[cj];W[bi];B[lb]C[PM: Time to try and give this group two eyes... maybe a bit late.]
;W[na];B[me];W[ne];B[mc];W[md];B[lc];W[nc];B[kf];W[mh]C[JC:
I should be getting worried about the situation in the top right, but I'm
too eager to attack the black group (and who knows - maybe save my group
below) to take the danger seriously.];B[kh];W[mf];B[ic];W[je]
;B[ke];W[jg];B[kg];W[jd];B[ji];W[ih];B[jc]C[PM: I now considered this group to have two eyes...]
;W[fi];B[rh];W[rg];B[dr]C[PM:
I considered myself to have three weaknesses: top-left corner, bottom-right
corner and the bottom edge. I decided this move to be the most important.]
;W[hb];B[fb]C[PM: I did not consider this to be any threat to my centre group - I thought I had two eyes...]
;W[jk]C[PM: oh... it's a ko fight.];B[lh];W[kj];B[ik];W[ka]
;B[la]C[JC: Another liberty gone for my group on the right.]
;W[jk];B[ma];W[nb];B[ik];W[ja]C[PM: I think this was a mistake for white...]
;B[kb];W[ia];B[ld]C[JC: And another.];W[jk];B[ib];W[ha];B[ik]
;W[ec]C[PM:
We reckoned that the ko fight was worth about 70 points, my only ko threat
left was to try and connect the group under threat L8 to N6, but I didn't
think the group at N6 was strong enough.];B[jk]C[PM: So I ignored. Perhaps white may have been better threatening the group at N6...]
;W[be];B[bd];W[de];B[ed];W[eb];B[fc]LB[db:a][ea:b][bb:c]C[EE: 'a' is better, makes 'b' and 'c' miai.]
;W[fa];B[bf]C[PM: and another ko fight...];W[cd];B[sb];W[ra]
;B[ce];W[ir];B[hq];W[pe]C[PM: I think white was getting worried that he only had one eye.



JC: Indeed - I wasn't at all sure I wasn't too late already.]
;B[ae];W[hr]C[PM: and a third ko fight...];B[gp];W[sj];B[om]
C[PM: I was happy with this connection.];W[sh];B[ao];W[sl]C[PM: I had overlooked this connection]
;B[rj]C[PM: Fortunately (?) I can cut with a ko!];W[sk];B[si]
;W[ri];B[qd];W[qb];B[si];W[gq];B[jp];W[ri];B[qe]C[PM: I have to admit, John pointed this ko threat out to me. Thanks John :)]
;W[qf];B[si];W[mm];B[oo]C[PM: Glad to be rid of these.];W[ri]
;B[an];W[bl];B[si];W[dq];B[eq];W[ri];B[bm];W[cl];B[si];W[do]
;B[cp];W[ri];B[cm];W[dm];B[si];W[bb];B[db];W[ri];B[am];W[qh]
;B[al];W[bj];B[bk]C[PM: Not sure if this was an intentional exchange by white, but I was reasonably happy with it.]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[el];B[ak];W[bg];B[dc];W[da];B[ca]C[PM: oops]
;W[ga];B[ea];W[qo];B[ag];W[ah];B[bh]C[PM: time for another ko!]
;W[af];B[sq]C[PM: My last ko threat, I think.];W[so];B[ag];W[mj]
;B[cg]C[PM:
At the end of the game, we discussed that this ko may have won me the game.
But thinking about it, allowing for the ignored ko threat, I think it was
only worth four points.

EE: Agree, it was decided earlier. Nice game, contained lot of fighting situations. I hope my comments were of use.]
