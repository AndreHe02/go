C[Hello Reviewer. This is the first game I send to the GTL so please forgive if I make any mystakes in the sfg editing.     I played as white, ManuelAzua.    I'm submitting this game because during it I felt totally overwhelmed during various part of the game, even do we were both 21kyuu.     This game was played on IGS.     But the real cause is that after I lost this game, we played another one  and that one I won by his resign.The difference of how I felt playing him was so great that I almost feel asif  I had been playing two different opponents in the two games. So I would like to know which mystakes in this game I might have corrected ''subsconsciously'' in the second game, so  to say.     Thanks.

Hi Manuel!  This is your reviewer speaking =)

It is quite common for beginners to feel like that. Sometimes you feel like you're playing five stones above your rating, and sometimes you're playing five stones below your rating. It has been said that your real rating varies, depending on your mood, opponent, time, etc, between 1/2 your rating and 3/2 your rating - i.e. a 20 k could be sometimes 30k, and sometimes 10k, but a 5k would only be sometimes 7k or 3k. I don't know whether that is true or not, but it certainly feels like that sometimes.

Overall, I think your problem is that you mistake moyo for territory. You play too loose, and don't make sure your areas are difficult to invade. Also, after every stone, go through the board and check if all your groups are still alive. Learn to avoid bad shapes - refuse to make empty triangles, for example. Try to play a game where you don't play any empty triangles or dubious shapes.   Counting is very important, and learning which stones are important and which are not. You should learn to keep cutting stones and throw away stones that lie between two live enemy groups.

You also place too much value in the center. Remember that there is usually very little territory in the center, and you have to spend many stones to defend it. Corners are much more efficient, since one well-placed stone can get many points, whereas in the center there usually is a way for the enemy to reduce the area.

Note how throughout your game black plays careful and solid moves, connecting a lot, whereas white plays much more aggressively and pressures black a lot, going for influence. However, there is never a significant difference in territory, except in the end when white loses the corner, so these two ways are quite equivalent. You should play more against this person and learn from him, and he should try and learn from you how to play for influence :-).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]C[At this stage of the game, when all the corners have been claimed. I usually attack at my opponent's third line from his stone( atO17 for example If I were to attack).     However as I am white I expect to see if I can dismiss my opponent's attack and either attack with a knight's move to his stones or place a stone in one of the stars to the sides.
---
This is fine.];B[ec];W[dc]C[I felt that giving away the corner woul make things too easy for him.

---

At this early stage of the game, almost all invasions live. Don't worry about that, just make solid groups.

I am not sure whether this is a good way to play, as it only strengthens black. Resulting with black answer at E16, he has beginnings of a nice wall.

This move is a much better idea if there is a white stone near the marked spot, since it prevents black from extending to that direction. It is not even necessary to answer black 5.]
;B[ed]LB[de:a][cg:b]C[I felt that after this mov I could take sente.

---

Well, your corner is not very secure at the moment. It might be a good idea to play at a or b.]
;W[jq]C[So I took this third line planning to invade the lower right corner]
;B[id]LB[nc:a]C[Then again this moves does nothing against my plan to develop a left and low mojo so...

---

No, it does not. But it does make a very strong statement about the black top territory. As you'll see in the end, black's territory is much more solid than yours, whereas you'll end up with weak groups.

You must invade around a before black plays there.];W[dj]LB[cj:A]
TR[dj][dp][jq]C[I play at the center left star.

---

This does not secure territory, though. It's good for moyo building and gaining influence towards the centre, but black can still invade and live.

Typically, when the other player has a double-wing formation such as what white has here (with the marked stones), the opponent would invade immediately. Incidentally, I think you should've played at a, instead of the star. This would give you better protection against the invasion.

See variation on what would happen if black would invade.]
(;B[mc]C[At this stage of the game this move looks too defensive for my playing style.

---

Perhaps. But black has territory, you have very little. All of your moyo is invadable.]
;W[qn]LB[mq:a][nq:b]C[However with 12 I now see that I overplayed my hand. An attack at O3 seems better to my now.

---

The purpose of playing on this side is not to attack the corner, but to live on the right side (In this case) after pressuring the corner. Territory-wise, playing a or b would be better.  B is a bit more loose, a is very solid.]

(;B[rp]C[This is not a good idea. Should white next invade at R3, black is in trouble.]

(;W[qp]C[I believe this is a mystake. I should have taken a postion near the center right star at the third line to make sure live.

---

Yes, I think so too. Playing a wedge usually means that you're sacrificing that stone for something else.

On the other hand, you could've squeezed black small with an alternate sequence.]
;B[qq];W[qo]
(;B[rq]C[Movement 17 seems unnecessary to me.

---

I don't think so. See variation.];W[pj]LB[qj:b][qk:a]C[I extend to the center right star. I now believe that an extension in the R line would have been better.

---

Yes, this is too high.  Also, it's a bit loose - a or be would definitely be better.

Remember that playing on the fourth line is about building influence, third line is about building territory. Since you are now inside enemy moyo, you might want to take territory first, influence later.]
;B[mp]C[This is too high, in my opinion. One line lower is better.]
;W[jo]LB[cp:a]C[Now that I see it a move like N3 would lay better to diminish black space on the bottom.

---

That too, but this is actually quite good. Combined with a move around a it really makes a very solid corner, that will be difficult to invade and live.  Playing N3 would let you have only just a few points, probably in gote. Moves like K5 are MUCH more important!]
;B[ql]C[Black invades very nicely, splicing your stones into two weak groups.
It'll be hard to keep both of your groups alive.]
(;W[rl]C[This is probably not a good idea, as you noticed.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[rj]C[After these movements my 18 stones is left in a weak postion. That's why I fell that it would have been played better in a lower position.

---

Yes.]
(;B[rm]C[Mistake by black, I believe. See variation.];W[qm]
;B[rn];W[ro];B[so];W[sn];B[sp];W[sm]C[Now white is alive, and black must try to contain the damage.]
;B[qi]C[This push is a good move to escape.];W[pi];B[ri]
(;W[mj]C[After making live for my group at the left I fel that I needed to protect my influence near the center. However, now I fell that it would have been better to separate black groups by playing at Q8.

---

Well, your right group is alive, so you don't have to worry about them any more. The bottom black group is if not alive, then at least hard to kill. The right black group is not necessarily alive, so you could leave your two stones on their on devices and try to attack the top corner. For example, see variation.]
;B[ph];W[pk]C[Now it's too late to place a stone on Q8. So I had to play 40 there.]
;B[pl];W[oh];B[pg];W[og];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi]C[I'm planning to eventually capture black's group while making my influence in the center bigger.

---

I don't think you can. Your two stones are too weak for that. You'd need the stone on q8 to do that, since that would allow the cut at q12.

Attacking the corner would be a good idea now, any more plays around that area are going to make black stronger.]
;W[kj];B[of];W[mh]C[This is a wasted stone. Just let it go and make bigger moves.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[kh]C[I believe black escapes with this move...

---

Black escaped earlier.  Your stones were too weak to cut.];W[lm]
LB[kn:A]C[So I felt that a movement to make territory in the center was good. However I see now that I should have played 56 at 8P to gain a bigger territoy while stopping black's groups from getting me in trouble at the center.

---

Well, white has no territory whatsoever yet. All of your moyo is still invadable. Playing on the left side becomes more and more urgent, as the plays there are very big.  Center typically has very little territory.

There is a clear cutting point at a. It will come back to haunt you later.]
;B[mf]LB[kc:B][qc:A][gd:C]C[I believe this move was unncesary.

---

Yes, black must attack the left side now. He has a huge area, worth about 80 points. It is still invadable, especially at the marked locations. However, whites moyo is much easier to invade.

In fact, black 57 would be much better in any of the marked locations or almost anywhere inside white moyo =).]
;W[ol]LB[de:C][cm:B][cp:A]C[Realizing my mystake at 56 I now play at 8P.

---

This is unnecessary.  There are much bigger points to play, especially the marked locations.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pn];W[on]C[This push is very bad for black, it just makes an invasion into the bottom right much easier for black, and makes solid territory in the center for white. Black has no need to connect, since his group is alive, and so are the white groups.  Do not separate alive groups!

White is very happy with this exchange.];B[po]
(;W[np]LB[nq:A]C[With the moves until 63 and I felt that 56 could act as a stopper for an escape of 19, so I attack and attach with 64.

---

Better to attack at marked spot. See variation.];B[no];W[op]
C[I now think that playing at 5P would have given a best result isolating black's 19 and 65]
;B[oo]TR[jk][kk][lk][mk][nk][ok][jl][kl][ll][ml][nl][jm][km]
[mm][nm]C[Now with 67 I have given black a chance to diminish my center territory.

---

Center territory is not important. The area you're trying to protect is perhaps 15 points in size.  There are much more important points to protect - invasion in the top right corner is worth 20 points or more.]
;W[mo]C[So I try top stop it.];B[mq];W[pq]C[Didn't know what I was doing there. An obvious mystake.

---

Not a very costly one. You have much better places to play, though.]
;B[pr]C[Black doesn't need to protect.]
(;W[nn]C[As you can see, the play on the right side star caused you to have influence towards the center.

Incidentally, play at a would be more solid, since it prevents the black sequence detailed in the variation.]

(;B[oq]C[An onncesary movement in my opinion.

---

Yes. Invading on the left is MUCH more important.];W[eb]LB[gd:A]
C[This move here now seems to me totally out of place. I should have tried an invasion at R17 or played betwee 4 and 10 to make my influence there bigger.

---

This is an endgame move, worth perhaps 5-7 points. It'll also remove the chance of invading at a. It is also gote, though your opponent plays carefully and protects.]
;B[fb];W[ea];B[fa];W[cb];B[fc]C[Black does not have to protect immediately, as the resulting ladder works for him. He'll need to protect it eventually, but sente is probably worth more right now.]
;W[ki]C[With 80 I try to make more territory in the center, However an extensio tio try to connect the center to 10 now seems better.

---

Your center is quite alive, so there is very little need to connect it to anything. This move is useful as a forcing move, since it forces black to protect his four stones somehow.]
;B[lh];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[kg]LB[ig:A]C[85 seems unncesary to me.

---

Yes, better push at a, which makes territory. Remember, black still has plenty of invading options in the bottom left, so giving the center is not that dangerous.]

(;W[ef]LB[de:A][ge:B][he:C][hf:D]C[I play 96 to try to connect somehow 86 and 84 and wishing a keep black form the center.

---

This is not a very good move, since black can easily cut at a, and threaten your corner and the stone you just played. There is no need to connect live groups. Move like 86 is usually to prepare for attack inside the enemy territory by building outside influence. You could play b, c, or d to reduce potential black territory now. Or you could just play a to make your corner and sides more safe.

See variations for better plays.];B[cn]C[Very important move by black. Unfortunately he botches the attack. If he lived, he'd have still a chance of winning this game. Had white played earlier in the corner area, w would be seriously winning this game.]
;W[dn]
(;B[co]C[This is probably not a good move.];W[cp]C[I blocked at 90 not wanting to lose corner territory.]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm]C[I always prefer to divide the invading groups so I played 92 even knowing tha this would be the resulting shape.]

(;B[bp];W[bq];B[ao];W[bn]C[I played at 98 to not let him make the eye so easily, but now it seems that perhaps I should have let him live there and block him form my left right territory with a play at 10B

---

Black will have an eye regardless of this move. You're lucky that black fouls this one up.]

(;B[an]C[Mistake by black.];W[bl]C[I play 100 there to capture 91 and so end black's invasion.

---

This is the correct move.]
(;B[bk];W[am]C[But I surprinsingly capture the invading stones after white mystake at 101]
;B[cj];W[dl];B[ck];W[ci]C[Now I'm triyng to diminish his eye space]
;B[dk]C[This is very bad shape, both players should avoid these.]
;W[ek];B[di];W[ej];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[ak];B[fh]C[The idea of 115 connecting black eyeless stones to the stones at the upper right didn't seem desireable so I tried to keep them appart.]
;W[ei];B[dh]
(;W[gf]C[I Believe that I should have played 118 at 12E to keep those four stones of black apparts.

---

Yes, but black could still connect.];B[eh];W[gi]LB[de:B][hg:A]
C[I feel that I should have blocked directly at 12G.

---

No, not really. Black could still connect, and you would have a big hole through which he could ooze to the center. It would be better to play at a, where black played later, or b to save the three stones. Notice the shape - these shapes white has left behind are very cuttable. You should learn to watch for them.]
;B[hg]C[Good cut, even though it does not connect.

You should stop leaving such obvious cutting points.];W[gg]
;B[gh];W[hh]C[It seems as if I achieved what I wanted. However this is were things started going downhill for me.

---

This is because you do not connect your three stones to the corner stones.]
;B[de]TR[ef][gf][gg]C[Here's another cutting point. Your marked stones are now in danger.]
;W[df];B[ce];W[cf]C[I felt that my corner group was alive so I was more worried in keeping th elong black group eyeless and isolated.]
;B[bf];W[ee];B[dd]C[Now I know that black will escape so I set out to make life for my whites stones at the top somehow. From here until almost the end is the part where I'm most clueless about what were my mistakes, maybe this plan was wrong from the beginning and I should have let those 6 black stones die.]
;W[ig]C[This plan does not work. It allows you to erode black territory, but you should learn to read the ladders.]
;B[hf]
(;W[he]LB[qc:A]C[Mistake. See variation for correct play (usually).

I don't see a way for you to save your stones, so you need to gain as much as you can from them and then just let them die. As long as it is just three stones, you can let them go. When you play more stones in there, it suddenly becomes more important to save them. Just trying to desperately live makes you lose more stones, and takes away your chances at invading. You could still play a, for example.]

Could I have managed an invasion at 17R and play a good endgame in order to gain a close victory, or was my resign good after all.     The handicap was 5.5, but I suppose I should have stated that at the beginning.     Thanks.
