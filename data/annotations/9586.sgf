(;W[lq]C[CG: Too slow! I would prefer to take sente here. A is big, but it is gote for both sides.]
;B[qj]LB[jc:B][ql:A]
(;W[ql]LB[fc:A][jc:B][nc:C]C[CG: Taking the "second biggest point" after your opponent played on the right side is bad. This is exactly why I don't like M3 - the right side *is* important.
However, once your opponent played S10, you should better play at the top at either A, B, or C.]
;B[ok]C[CG: This is your chance to switch to the top! If you answer locally, you are securing your territory, but locally you gain fewer points than black.
If you don't answer, black may eventually get the opportunity to play again and reduce your territory, but I'm sure that you would gain more points by playing first on the top side.]
;W[om];B[jd]TR[qj][ok][ql][om]C[LL: a very good development for black

CG: I completely agree! Consider black had played K16 before the marked stones are exchanged. Of course you would play R14 (or maybe R10). Now black managed to play first on the right *and* on the top. 
You already lost quite some points - the game is now very easy for black!!]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[ld];B[kc];W[mg];B[cg]LB[je:A]C[LL: how to play, now ???

CG: Difficult question. Your stones on the top are still weak, so you must be careful with invading in the top left. Personally I would attach at A first and then invade the top left corner.]
;W[cc]C[LL: is this a bad choice ???

CG: If you get sente, it's ok. If you end up in gote and black gets K14, you're in trouble. That's why I would play K15 first.]

(LL)];B[nk];W[ng];B[hi];W[br];B[kr];W[lr]C[CG: You should read the chapter on endgame in Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go". It demonstrates how many points you lose if you answer "sente" moves like this. You should understand that L2 and S9 are miai and that you can't allow black to get both of them!!!]
