C[
XCM: Hi! Thanks for taking time to review this game, it means a lot to me. Seriously.

This game is another of my 5-3-point experimentation games. Surprisingly, it went rather well. Unfortunately, my opponent was so upset ( i can understand why) that he did not stay behind to have even a short discusion.

Honestly, i cant see too well why i won by resignation, but i can see that i was ahead. Please help!

Also, please point out things that i may have not asked questions for. Thanks!

MM:  Hi, this is Mike Malveaux, reviewing your game for the Go Teaching Ladder.  I'm only about 7k, so please treat my comments with a little healthy skepticism.  Still, I hope I can point out a few things that will help you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[ce]C[MM:  Popular during the medieval Japanese "Golden Age of Go," this is a little unusual nowadays because it leaves the corner (where the easiest points are) open for White.]
;W[qp];B[ch]LB[dc:A]C[XCM: Yes, i know that most would consider this move it slow. But from my experiments i have concluded that it is strong for thwarting an invasion at A. Please see the usual fueski i provided and compare it to what actually happened in the game.

MM:  C12 does seem slow to me.  White can still play for the corner, though C17 might be better than D17 (your "A"); I'm not sure.

Black D17 would claim the corner more completely, and work well with C15 and Q16.  But there's nothing wrong with experimentation.]
;W[dc]C[MM:  I don't know the 5-3 joseki well enough to be sure, but on balance, I suspect this is incorrect with the C12 stone already on the board.  Maybe White should either solidly take the corner with C17, or else back away a little from the Black strength to something like F17.  Oh well...  White ended up with a decent position, I think, so this is probably ok.]

(;B[fc]C[XCM: Instead of playing at E16 i played here. Thoughts?

MM:  This looks fine.  I expect White will play to separate the C15 stone from the F17 you just played.  Then I expect Black can put pressure on the new White group, making profit in the north and the west.  Probably Black cannot kill the group, but taking profits should be enough.  I doubt that it's automatically better than putting C12 at D17 would have been; but it seems like a reasonable way for Black to play.]
;W[de]C[MM:  Interesting choice; I would have played E16 or E15.  I can't say which is best.]
;B[df];W[ee];B[fe]C[XCM: seems OK to me so far. What do you say?

MM:  It looks like the harass-and-profit plan is off to a good start.  Next White should play E14.]
;W[ef];B[dg]C[MM:  Since it's unreasonable to expect to kill, this seems slow to me.  You might as well be prepared to sacrifice the C15 stone in favor of bigger points elsewhere.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[bd];B[kd]C[XCM: Big point, sketching a large side. Is this ok? Is there a better place to go?

MM:  I think this is excellent.  Perhaps a line too far from the F17-F15 quasi-wall... K17/K16 would be stronger, but would leave a bigger gap around O17.  All in all, I think this is excellent timing and excellent placement.  Since White has sente and a presence in three corners, I suspect this is about even for both players.

Don't forget that White has B14, though.  In fact, since A16 (normally an endgame move) seems like sente vs. the northwest corner, maybe you should play that first?]
;W[jp]TR[kq][kp][oq]C[MM:  Slightly odd -- L3/L4 or P3 would be more usual.  Not automatically bad, but it gives Black more room for mischief around P3/P4.  Still, it's the right idea of what to do with sente after the northwest sequence.]
;B[oq]TR[oo]C[XCM: OK, i need an attack. Is this the right orientation, or should i have approached from the East side? Playing P3 seems kind of like jumping into White's sphere of influence...

I disagree that you need an attack.  White's south is becoming large, but so is your north.  You could have a very good game just by playing near Q10, I think.  But, there's also nothing wrong with the attack.  Jumping into White's area will start a fight, of course.  The result will probably be a small living Black group around P3, dividing a White corner from a big White south side group.  You may have preferred to play from P5 or P4, to better work with your north side stones.]
;W[pm]C[XCM:...um, ok, he just let me make base easily. Who could say no to a free lunch? Or should i have responded to Q7?

MM:  Q7 is not a bad move:  developing from R5, it indirectly puts pressure on P3 but more importantly stakes a claim in front of your north side strength.  If White had instead pincered at N3 or N4, you could still make a base with R2 then jump toward the center with P5.  If I were White, I would have played P5 instead, to try to link R4 with K4.]
;B[lq]C[MM:  Normally this would be a good move, but under these circumstances, it seems slow.  If White next plays something like N5, then White's virtually connected and Black is boxed into a small side group, and still under some pressure.  So, I think Black could do better with something like Q5, maybe even O6 (though that looks odd, maybe too thin) or at least M4.]
;W[kq]C[MM:  Personally, I would have played high to connect, but this looks good too.]
;B[lp]C[MM:  Now the P3 stone seems a little too close to the new Black wall.  But the White groups are almost split, so this is ok.]
;W[qf]C[MM:  Excellent timing, and excellent placement!]
(;B[qh]C[XCM: Is the pincer appropriate here? I didn't want him to take the East side so i didn't play the usual joseki of Q14-Q15-P14-etc. I reasoned that the L16 stone was good for backup. Thoughts?

MM: You seem to focus more on what the opponent might get, rather than what you might get.  I think you can concede the east side, since your north side is so big.  White's south side may be large, but with C6 you can get a correspondingly large west.  Let's look at Q14 etc. -- back for var.  (I think you meant Q14-Q13, not Q14-Q15?  Well I'll look at Q14-Q13 anyhow.)

But, the pincer is not bad; just maybe a little more combative than necessary.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[mg];B[qk]C[XCM: Base.

MM:  Good; not yet fully alive of course, it is still a fight.  White has a standard approach to this shape at Q12.  But White has two semi-weak groups to the north and the south, so you will be ok.]
;W[rd]TR[nc][nd]C[MM:  Interesting.  This is probably safest, but I would have tried to isolate the Q16 stone with something like O17 or O16.]
;B[pf]C[XCM: Is this too aggressive? Should i have played something like O16 instead?

MM:  It does seem too agressive.  The White stones are not that weak, and you are not so far behind that you have to try risky, desperate maneuvers.  On the other hand, this looks like it will be fun.  Let's see how the fight goes.]
;W[pe];B[pg]
(;W[od]C[MM:  This is a mistake -- better to connect solidly with R15, or better, P15 (back for variations).]
;B[qe];W[oe];B[qd]C[MM:  Good, Black wins the corner.];W[re]
C[MM: Mistake -- better to leave the aji for the future.];B[rf]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[pb];B[rb];W[lc];B[kc];W[ld];B[kf]
C[MM:  Good.  White misplayed the corner, and had to live in your north area.  Your north looks a little vulnerable to a move like H18, but White is a little vulnerable to O18, so it's probably a matter of whoever attacks first.  But the really big target for Black should be Q7:  connecting the R9 and P3 groups would be *huge*.  Likewise, White should play something like O7 to keep them divided.]
;W[lf];B[kg]C[MM:  This would be a nice point for White, so I don't blame you for taking it, but it seems too slow.  Now both White and Black seem more stable in the north, and should turn their attention to the C6 or the R2 area.]
;W[ql]C[MM:  Good, that stone helps a lot.];B[pk];W[mi]TR[cn]
C[MM:  Seems too optimistic.  Better to simply play something like C6.]
;B[ki]LB[mk:A][qr:B][cn:C]C[XCM: OK, this was a tricky choice. I was jugling between L11 and somewhere around A. If i had played A, i could roam around and destroy territory, using the R11 area as base. But playing L11 gives me more potential for actually MAKING territory. In the end, i chose L11. Opinions?

MM:  Destroying White territory and making Black territory both add points to Black's net score.  A 6-dan I used to know was fond of saying "first make your stones strong; then you can do anything you want."

I think L11 is better than N9 (your "A"), because it's less of a target for White.  Probably the best place for Black now is R2 (B) because it secures the P3 group and simultaneously renews the pressure vs. the R6 area, or C6 (C) because it expands the west and threatens the south.]
;W[cj]C[MM:  Good idea!  Too close to Black's strength though.  White has B13 or B14, but it would be crazy to expect to kill, because it's too easy to run toward the L13 wall.  Also, now that White is starting a ruckus in the west, White needs to think about countermeasures if Black attacks the northwest corner with B18/C18.]
;B[cl]C[XCM: Good? Bad? Alternatives?

MM:  Since White came so close to C12, I think this is excellent.  You now have the invader just about surrounded on three sides, and the edge of the board is on the other side.  This is why there's a proverb "play away from strength", which White should have heeded.]
;W[ej]
(;B[bj]LB[co:A][el:B][cn:C]C[XCM: I think i made a mistake here. There's no way i can prevent my C8 stone from getting cut off from the C12 base. Would A have ben better, trying for another base?

MM:  Usually you can connect C8 with C12, by sacrificing a stone at D10.  In this case, with E10 on the board, I think it leads to a ko.  Still, I think B10 is good:  While White thrashes around preventing the connection, you build strong shapes with which to attack the invaders.

Other possibilities -- I think E8 ("B") has a good chance; I would try that rather than "A" (because after A, White at C4 is just too good for White).  You could also make a smaller base with "C" at C6, planning to jump toward the center with something like E7 or F7 after White defends the corner.]
;W[cn]C[XCM: Actually, he gave me a chance to connect, but i didn't take it. I felt that I needed to do something about the area around G7. Thoughts?

MM:  "First make you own stones strong, then you can do anything you want."  I would not have the guts to leave the C12 region unsettled.  G7 might not be bad though, since it attacks the E10 invaders, and also threatens the F3 area a bit.]
;B[el];W[bk]C[MM:  Mistake -- this doesn't work so well after F8.  Ok, here's a chance for Black to connect -- C9, then White must B11, and then D10 atari.]

(;B[bi];W[ck];B[gl]C[MM:  This is turning into a very high-stakes fight.  Black needs a play on the B13 vital point soon, or else needs to make sure the C9 structure will die... but those can simply connect with B8, or possibly F12...  Egad!]
;W[bl]C[MM:  Safe.  Too slow?  "Make your stones strong..."  I guess this is the correct way to play.  The three running stones still have to connect, then White can attack at B13, or the H14 area.]
;B[dm]C[XCM: Should I have just kept running with the one-point jump?

MM:  Yes.  There is very little value in saving one stone, unless it is performing a useful function like cutting some White groups apart.  But, this starts to make a little eyeshape, so it's not all bad.]
;W[cm]C[MM:  A wasted move.];B[il]C[MM:  Good!  Now to save the B13 stones, preferably by connecting out.]
;W[gq]C[MM:  I sympathize -- that's a big area White wants to keep -- but this is too defensive.]
;B[go]TR[gh][qr]C[XCM: I thought this was good. It reduces his territory while creating points for myself. Thoughts?

MM:  Not bad.  Maybe G12 is bigger?  R2 certainly seems bigger.]
;W[jn];B[kl];W[ff]C[MM:  Great move.  Now Black will need B13.]
;B[ge];W[fh];B[hh];W[kb];B[jb];W[ka]TR[pq]C[MM:  Too soon for this endgame move.  Q3 would be better.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[ja];W[mb];B[mk]C[MM:  Connecting your groups -- great!]
;W[oo];B[rn]C[XCM: OK, please tell me how the heck i managed to pull this off?! Maybe White wasn't thinking at the time...]
;W[rl];B[po];W[pp];B[op]
(;W[no]C[MM:  Mistake.  It looks like R5 works, or even Q6.]
;B[qo];W[pq]C[MM:  Mistake two.  Why oh why make an empty triangle here, now??!?]
;B[pr]
(;W[qr]C[MM:  Mistake three.  Attack the weak stones, not the strong ones.]
;B[rp]C[MM:  Good, punish the empty triangle.];W[qq];B[or]C[MM:  Very good.  Black took advantage of White's errors, and stole the corner.]
;W[pn]C[MM:  Maybe N3 instead?  No, even that does not work.  White's only hope is B13.]

Once again, Thanks for taking your time to help review this game!

MM:  Probably White felt demoralized by losing the southeast corner, so let's count.  Assuming Black lives around B13, and White saves the P5 stones (circles), then White seems behind by at least 25 points.  White's southwest is large, but Black's two corners add up to more, even before accounting for the dead Whites still on the board.

Connecting O5 to K7 will be tough, which means in effect Black owns the whole east side, and does not have any weak groups (other than B13, which White may not have seen -- forward for var.); so there seems no room for White to make a comeback.

Thanks for the chance to review your game.  It was a lot of fun for me.  I hope it helps with your game.  You seem to have a good grasp of shape, and good fighting spirit, and the courage to try new things.  In terms of your style, you seem to have the same blind spot I've had for years -- seeing the opponent's possibilities and rushing to counter them, but neglecting one's own, bigger, chances.  I think with more study and more games, you can become quite a strong player; I wish you lots of fun along the way.
