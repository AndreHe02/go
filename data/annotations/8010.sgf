C[Dear Review:

I was trying to play in a more aggressive manner. I find that my reading is not always on target. I would appreciate it if you could focus your review on opening, direction of play, and some useful tesuji in combat situation in particular as well as an overview of the whole game.

I reviewed the game myself. If you could take a look at that as well, and see if my own opinion is right, that would be very helpful, as it would confirm that my reading of my own mistakes are right.

Thank you very much in advance.

[j\] Hi, Jamie here. I'll focus more on black per your request.

One issue with a type of fighting you tried is that your attacking stones were immediately also weak stones. It's important to have a position of strength to fight from.

Where you provided some of your own options the move you actually played in the game was often equal to or better than your options. Generally, the error arose before you recognised it as such. This is a standard problem, as your strength improves you will see these errors sooner.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq]LB[ce:B][de:A]C[[j\] Approaching the wider side in the unfinished corner is more normal. I did some research on this point and discovered the issue is more complex than I can handle, so I suggest you stick with the more usual technique of approaching the unfinished corner first.]
;W[dn];B[cl]LB[cl:A][fq:B]C[I wanted to try a new tactic.

[j\] You've just given white a choice between two weak stones to attack. Better to avoid this situation.]
;W[ci];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep];W[dr]LB[cl:B][do:A][kq:C]TR[hq][nq]
C[I wonder if white trying to keep corner is a mistake.

[j\] White should just connect at A, this leaves black with a weak stone at B and a need to extend to prevent white invading at C where white would find life easily (2 space extension in either direction).]
(;B[er]LB[jp:B][eq:A]C[[j\] B has several other options here. See variation for the one I like the best. A would have achieved a similar result to your play without the complication B dodges the problem entirely and allows you to move on to bigger things.]
;W[eq]LB[do:A]C[[j\] White still better to just play A. Why play the ko?????]
;B[eo];W[do]C[[j\] The variations you have here are about rescuing a problem situation. Better to avoid it earlier.]
(;B[dk];W[cf]LB[ei:A][kq:B]C[[j\] white is too submissive. A shows more spirit. White should also be looking for B to erase the value of your wall.]
;B[en]
(;W[dm]
(;B[el];W[nc]LB[pj:A][kq:B]C[[j\] Your best potential lies in the direction of A and B. White helps you towards this with this play.]
(;B[qf];W[jd]LB[lc:B][qf:A]C[[j\] This is not a good choice for white. With your stone at A the corner is closed (somewhat anyway) to white so an invasion at B seems both inevitable and good for black (now right now though, when there are bigger things left).]
;B[pb]LB[pj:A][kq:B]C[[j\] This gives you maybe 9 pts. A and B are both larger.]
;W[gc]LB[ne:A][qk:B][kq:C]C[[j\] This is very slow and does very little to help whites position. A is preferable. Black has much potential in the right, centre and bottom which white must deal with.

B and C are both beckoning for white to play as well. So many good options.]
;B[lc];W[kc]
(;B[md];W[lb];B[kd];W[jc];B[nb];W[mb];B[mc];W[ob];B[oc];W[na]
;B[nd];W[nb]C[[j\] This whole sequence up here was filled with opportunities for either black or white to tenuki and play somewhere far far bigger.]
;B[pj]LB[em:B][kq:A]C[[j\] Good. Important to be here first. However, perhaps A was bigger. The reason I prefer A is that a white invasion on this side takes advantage of the weakness at B, and the weakness at B can have some really unpleasant results later.]
;W[jq]LB[kq:A]TR[hq][nq]C[[j\] I think this is too close to your wall. White really really ought to be at least 1 space to the right giving 2 space extensions possible on both sides.]
;B[lq]LB[em:A][mq:C][nq:B]C[[j\] This *is* the bigger side but the cut at A is potentially a serious problem. Later white invades at the weak point at B, playing C now would have made this more difficult for white.]
;W[jo]
(;B[hq]LB[em:B][lo:A]C[[j\] this is so close to you other stones, however much I would prefer to play A the cut at B is becoming worrying.]
;W[nq]C[[j\] This seems inevitable at this point, clearly a problem earlier.]
;B[np]C[[j\] you cant kill everything white, this move basically allows white the option of connecting.]
(;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[mq];W[nr];B[kp];W[jp];B[ln]LB[km:A]C[[j\] I think you can apply more pressure on white here by playing at A.]
;W[ql]
(;B[rq]C[[j\] Attack a group by stealing its base. See variation.]
;W[rr];B[qr]C[This is a over play on my part. I think my opponent could have punished.

[j\] Yeah, not particularly productive here at the moment. But it did leave a very interesting issue (see much later)]
;W[pr];B[rp];W[rj]LB[jo:C][rp:B][rq:A]C[[j\] Much as I dislike picking just one move as the deciding point this one is large. The black attack at A, and the connection at B surrenders sente to white and white puts this to good use getting a base, a bonus for white is that C is not immediately harmed and you later need to spend a move to seal C in.]

(;B[jm]LB[ei:A][em:C][jo:B]C[[j\] You are behind at the moment so you need to approach this on a grander scale. A perhaps, though you must still suceed in killing B and C is a lingering problem. See variation.]
