AB[pj][dj][dd][pp][dp][pd]C[Hello!

My name is Vitalii, I was playing white and interesting in review for both sides. After reviewing game myself I haven't find big obvious mistakes, so I think I should have choosen another tacktics..
Can you help me to see my and my opponent's mistakes and other possibilities in fuseki and till middle game.

I try to comment most valuable point/moves in the game where another variation can change the way of game cardinally..

\\m/ : Hi, I'm Florian, around 1d on KGS. I will do my best to review this game.  H6 stones are hard to review because in this kind of games, you have to force your opponent to the mistake for taking back the handicap. So, even with a correct play by white, if black doesn't make big enough mistakes, the game is easy for him.

But anyway, let's try to look at this.]PL[W];W[fq];B[cn];W[nq]
;B[or]LB[qp:a][no:b]C[I was a bit disturbed about next move and what to do with it next..

Should white invade or play for influence or even tenuki just now?

\\m/ : The first idea that comes to my mind in this position would be a pincer as you played.    When you're 6 stones stronger, you can try the joseki starting with A, there's a chance that black forgot a cut in the sequence. The simple jump at B ito continue building your moyo is also good. Tenuki is always a possibility.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[no]MA[op]C[Black left cutting point P4.
What move for black fit better in this situation?

\\m/ : Untill now this is joseki. This joseki is fight oriented with letting this cut, but here with q10 pincering the r6 stones, I find it's a good choice for b.]
(;W[ol];B[qk];W[ql]C[\\m/ : A bit slow, better to go out.];B[pl]
;W[pm];B[pk];W[nn];B[op];W[mo]C[I try to keep my stones connected - is it nessesary just now, or I can tenuki?

\\m/ : this a good result for you, b is enclosed to the corner and your weak r6 can breath a little. Tenuki now is asking for being cut and more trouble.]
;B[hq];W[kq];B[ho];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[\\m/ : obviously, wrong direction];W[dq]
(;B[fp];W[fr];B[hr]
(;W[nc]C[Is it right direction?

But with this move, seems I allow black to eliminate weakness near 13/14 line..

\\m/ : Here you push b in the direction of his empty triangle. Attacking the four stones before, look at how b reacts and go for the corner after]
(;B[ob]C[Black again play low moves, but for me upper side was move important..]
(;W[nb];B[oc]
(;W[fc];B[ee];W[hd]
(;B[hf]
(;W[hj]TR[nd][ff][cc][cj][eg][ph][lm]C[\\m/ : O16 is still an urgent move

This looks impatient, b starts a moyo and you feel you have to invade it. But there are still rooms for invasion and weaknesses in the moyo. In general, it's really hard to make points in the center]
(;B[lj]C[\\m/ : strange...];W[jj];B[kn];W[np];B[oo];W[mn];B[ll]
C[This move seems not nessesary,
black can get more profit, I think, from K14 or O15 or B3..

\\m/ : k14 good, e17 too, o15 will permit w to protect his weak shape, o16 instead is deadly. b3 big yose and sente but too early for that because of c6(w won't play it because it will be gote so it's black privilege, small compensation for wrong direction when blocking 3-3 invasion)]
;W[jg]C[I was afraid it is too far and can be cut..
which variation can you propose?

\\m/ : Now that you have engaged 2 stones in the center, you can't abandon them so you do'nt really have choice.]
(;B[hh]C[I think black should cut at J15 or even J11?

\\m/ : right, b should cut, I like k14 here although "don't touch what you're attacking" but here, it's a good leaning attack against the top]
;W[je];B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[ci]
(;B[cf]C[I try to make more threats for future, while there is a possibility..

[ms]C[Seems this is the last reduction, white can do.
And other moves are just end-game.
Black have made a mistake, so white get few points to make game almost equal, but it was just a luck..

\\m/ : delta look biggest endgame moves, but yose seems to be my weakest point and you play it very well :)]

;C[\\m/ : with correct yose by both, w leads is about 10 pts, not sure black really counted before resigning. 

I think your principal problem in this game is a lack of patience. In handicap games, stay flexible and build strong shape to launch attack at every weakness that appears in black's shape. But you've done the job here with a lead of about 10 points, you had your 6 stones back and enough to have a comfortable endgame, so you can be proud of your game. In a more general way, take care of your shapes (and your opponent's ones)]
