AB[cc][gc][cg]C[Thank you for reviewing this game!

Sure thing Colin.]PL[W];W[ef];B[de];W[dh];B[ch];W[fd]
(;B[ee]C[I defended here to threaten to cut 5 off. I feared that A was too passive and that the contact play B strengthened 5, but on review I think A was better.

-------

A play like A would probably make things very tough for white because of how strong you now are on the left and top. You have about 37 points to white's 23.

But it's important to play a handicap game more aggressively. Clever opponents will chip at the lead when they sense passive play. You want to think about how you can use your strong and safe handicap stones to launch an attack. Feel free to go bold and make a move like G5. If white is on the defensive all game, you can control the pace and come out ahead.]

(;B[ge]C[I think this cut worked for me (I read the variation for white at A into the ladder), but was caught by 25 after white had extended the stones below. How should I have handled the aji?

At this point, I think it was more important to protect G7. White is planning on using his strength in the top right for life. I've provided a variation. 

With the move you played, you tried to take the bottom, but white doesn't have a lot of points in the bottom anyways, especially if you play something like G3.]

(;W[gg];B[eh]C[I think this was a mistake. I couldn't read out the lower right corner and was concerned about letting white be solid on my left side.]

(;B[dc]C[C8 is better. D7 is trying to get points in the middle, but C8 gets more in the corner.]
;W[cb]
(;B[bc]C[Block at 22 or A?

A is a nice idea, B7 is way too passivive. At the very least B8.]

(;B[ed]C[I'm fairly sure this wasn't the biggest point, but the only other idea I had was the cut and I couldn't find a good result there.

B8 is better. Grab those points in the corner.];W[bb];B[ab]

C[9x9 can be tricky to get the feel for. The computer is good at chipping away at a lead. Right now I just recommend playing lots of games and gaining experience, but you can also start learning how to estimate how many points you and your opponents have, and think about how many points a certain move might get you. Let me know if you have any more questions.]
