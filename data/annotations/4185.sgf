C[BenLaowai: Hi reviewer. Thanks again for having a look at this game.

catch22: Hi, I will be reviewing your game. I hope you will find my comments useful]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[dd]C[BenLaowai: Hmm. Should have cut here.]

(;B[qm]C[BenLaowai: What was I thinking?

catch22: The cut is indeed a better, and more usual, move in this situation. White can then do no more than save one of the stones]
;W[pm];B[rn];W[pn];B[nq];W[rm]C[catch22: I think White got a favourable result here, especially given that he played one stone less. As the game shows, the White stones are quite resilient. Furthermore, they do restrict Black's options at the right side of the board.]
;B[oc];W[cn]
(;B[pj]C[catch22: I am not convinced that this is a good move. It seems too close to White's postion (and White can safely ignore it). Also it is too far from Black's position at the top right, in particular because Black does not have a good way to connect to these stones with an additional move. If, on the other hand, this stone would be placed on the third line (at R10), Black would have a good follow-up move at Q13. Still, playing at R10 does not seem good either, as it's still too close to White's stones and the low position may help White to build influence in the center. See variation.

Therefore, maybe Black should ignore the right side for now and play elsewhere. The right side does not seem urgent. If White extends from his group, Black is happy to counter extend from his top corner position. If White approaches the Black stones at the top too closely, Black is happy to play in between and separate the White stone from the White group below.]
;W[dj];B[gc]C[BenLaowai: Too far? The plan was to invite an invasion on the top and surround it to get profit on the right side. This was in fact how the game went (sort of...) But what do you think?

catch22: I would prefer playing one point closer to the White stone instead (at F17). That would leave you with more options in the corner should White prevent you from extending to the right. 

Furthermore, if you play at F17 instead you have better options when White plays in between at the top. You can at least make a nice two-space extension from one of your positions (unlike the continuation in the game, where there is only room for a one-space extension on either side).]
;W[cf];B[db];W[kc]TR[gc]C[catch22: There is no room for Black now to make a two space extension at either side. That is part of the reason I would have prefered the marked stone to be one point to the left.]
;B[ke]C[BenLaowai: Where would you put this move?

catch22: Because there is no room for a proper extension at either side, this seems the best idea.]
;W[ic];B[he];W[mb];B[md]C[BenLaowai: I was 100% happy with this result... but...]
;W[qh]
(;B[qj]C[catch22: I think that pulling out the stone, as in your variation is better, because it is a more effective dual purpose move. However, see also my comments in the variation.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[pf];B[oh];W[ph];B[oi];W[og];B[rg]C[BenLaowai: Is this a mistake?

catch22: This is the type of move you typically play in order to kill, or at least, to put pressure on a group, for instance to force it to run away. So before you play it, you should read out whether or not it works, as you do not want it to end up as a wasted move. 

In this case it seems playable, although you were not consistent in your follow-up. In the game this stone ends up as a sacrifice without much to show for in return. For Black's next move, I have added a variation that is more consistent with this move.]
;W[qe]
(;B[rd]C[catch22: Connecting underneath seems playable and is more consistend with Black's previous move. See variation.]
;W[sg];B[sh];W[sf];B[pe];W[qf];B[ng];W[oe]TR[rg][sh]C[catch22: No matter how Black responds, White is able to create two eyes and live. So Black's two marked stones have gone to waste, without much purpose. So Black's line of play here is questionable.]
;B[od];W[qg];B[ne];W[pd];B[pc];W[iq]C[BenLaowai: And white takes the big point.

Was there a crucial mistake in the fight that allowed this group to live? It seems unkillable to me, but...
If not, was the original idea of hoping for some territory here after n16 wrong? Or, should I be reasonably happy with this result as it is, since white has no points here at all and is surrounded? (If I should be reasonably happy, please explain how to take advantage, this looks pretty useless to me unless top w group dies... that's the next question :-)

catch22: I don't think Black should be happy, in particular because White managed to live in sente. Furthermore, although Black created influence in the center, it is not perfect as there are still potential cutting points. These cannot be exploited immediately by White, but they may come back to haunt Black. Also, White has built a nice position at the left in the meantime, which makes it hard for Black to exploit the influence that he has built up.

I don't think Black's move at N16 was wrong but I think Black's play lacked efficiency when dealing with White's invasion. The problem is not that White was not killed (that may very well have been impossible and should not have been the aim), but that Black did not tactically play the best moves. Also strategically these moves seemed inconsistent.]
;B[nf];W[of];B[ql]C[BenLaowai: Since I have a wall up top, all I really want to do is push this w into it. This line of play though turned out to be unreasonable. Your thoughts?

catch22: It does seem a bit premature, partly because the Black wall is not really facing the White group, and also still has a weakness at O12. It is not clear how Black will gain from the attack. However, because Black has fallen behind by now, it is difficult to find a really good move.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[sn];B[mn];W[rl]
(;B[rk]C[catch22: Because this results in bad shape for Black (two empty triangles after White's forcing move), it is probably better to play at Q7 instead. See variation.]
;W[pl];B[qk]TR[qj]C[catch22: White has forced Black into bad shape. It is bad because it is inefficient.  The marked Black stone might as well not have been played, as it does not have any purpose. It has become a wasted move.]
;W[ml];B[sl]C[catch22: Destroying White's eye along the side is premature. Destroying it is gote for Black, and making the eye is also gote for White, so there is no rush. In particular because White still has plenty of opportunity to run away.]
;W[mm]TR[sl]C[catch22: Looking at this position, it should be clear that White's last move plays a bigger role in the game than Black's last move. It is more efficient, and therefore better.]

(;B[nb];W[gb];B[fb];W[hc];B[gd];W[ha];B[lb];W[kb];B[lc];W[ib]

(;B[dh]TR[iq]C[BenLaowai: Seems I need something like this, but is this the point for it? Maybe g3? Anything jump out at you?

catch22: This move is not very good. White can still connect his stones. Only because of an error by White does Black get a good result in the game (see my comments later on).

The usual move to consider locally is C12. See variation. This may be one of the better moves right now.

I don't think G3 works very well. See variation. I am not sure if there is a particularly good move for Black at the bottom. Black can destroy some of White's potential territory, but because of the marked White stone, White can secure territory elsewhere along the bottom in return.]
;W[ch];B[ci]
(;W[cg]C[catch22: White lets Black of the hook. White should cut instead, which gives a much better result. See variation.]
;B[di];W[eq];B[cc];W[cd];B[gq]C[BenLaowai: Seems suspect. Any other options? is l3 reasonable? continue on LHS instead? Considered these but wj5 or similar seemed too hard to bear. Your thoughts?

catch22: Yes, this is not a good move. White is happy to extend, whereas Black has another stone to worry about.

However, the thuth is that Black has fallen behind, so creating complications, by separating White's stones may be the way forward.]
;W[lq];B[go];W[mr];B[nr];W[hr]
(;B[bk]C[BenLaowai: Right continuation locally? What about c10?

catch22: No, I don't think that this is not the right continuation, and neither is C10. Both moves seem to be concerned with destroying potential White territory, but this is premature. See variation.]
;W[cl]C[catch22: White meekly responds. Attacking the two Black stones at the bottom by playing G7 seems much more promising.]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[bc];W[bd];B[ej];W[dk]C[catch22: Another weak move by White. There is no need to save this stone. These Black stones cannot be attacked anyway, because Black is so strong in the top half of the board. White should grab this chance to attack the two Black stones at the bottom. It is hard to see how these can survive then, and the bottom left quadrant of the board would likely become entirely White's.]
;B[gm]C[catch22: Indeed, this move was urgent.];W[jo];B[kn]
;W[nn];B[mp];W[lj];B[mi];W[km];B[no];W[ln];B[lo]
(;W[lm]C[catch22: Instead of connecting at M7, White should first start a ko by capturing at N5. See variation.]
;B[ko];W[il];B[gk];W[ij];B[nk]C[catch22: This is not a great move, as it does not threat to cut, nor gain much for Black...]

(;W[nl]C[catch22: White apparently got scared into responding, but would have been better off playing elsewhere. See variation.]
;B[jp];W[gr];B[kq];W[kr];B[ip];W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[dc]
C[catch22: This is not a good move by White. It strengthens Black's position without much gain. Doing so harms White as it destroy's aji (future possibilities). This becomes clear in a variation later on.]
;B[eb];W[ef];B[li];W[ki];B[kh];W[ji];B[jh];W[ih];B[hi];W[ii]
;B[jn]C[catch22: This is not a very big move. Playing the monkey jump at A6 is much bigger, partly because it is pretty much sente.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[jq];B[ri]C[catch22: This is too small to be played right now as a White move here is gote anyway. Playing here harms Black, as he loses a very big ko threat.]
;W[rh]
(;B[bl]C[catch22: Why not play A6 instead? This is much bigger (and also sente).]
;W[bm];B[dm];W[cm];B[do];W[co];B[jd];W[jb]C[catch22: There is no reason for White not to play at K17 instead.]
;B[ka];W[ja];B[la]
(;W[id]C[catch22: Another bad move by White. It results in bad shape, and only makes Black stronger by forcing him to connect. 

Locally, a better move for White is J15 (see variaton). This move must be played when the time is right, but as any Black move in the area is now gote, White should be in no rush.]

[rq][sq][or][pr][qr][rr][sr][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[BenLaowai: So finally this was decided in the endgame. But what I'd really like some comment on is the fate of the two small white groups early on. Letting both live seemed like a disaster at the time, although they do seem unkillable to me now. Should this (could this) have been avoided completely earlier by playing closer and safer, or was there some kind of potential from the wall surrounding them that I didn't manage to tap into?

Thanks for your time,

Steve aka Benlaowai

catch22: I think you fell behind very early on by playing S6 instead of cutting at Q6. Subsequently, your moves lacked efficiency when attacking both White invasions. By then you had fallen behind even more. The wall you built was not that strong, and not facing the right way, so it was hard to exploit. In the end the game became close because the second half of the game you played better than White, who started to slip up a little bit.

In short, I think your game was strategically fairly sound, but you lost due to tactical errors. I suggest you think more about the efficiency of your moves. Play multi-purpose moves whenever possible. Try to give your stones good shape. Also try to create and exploit bad aji in your opponent's position, but don't do so prematurely.]
