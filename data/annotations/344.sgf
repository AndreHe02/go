TM[600]KM[0.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jp];B[jd];W[qf];B[nd]C[B9. Given B7, the pincer at R12 now would be ideal, to induce W10 to enter the 3-3 point. But the text certainly isn't bad by any means.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[cj];W[fc];B[cn];W[cp]C[W16. Very slow and ponderous, although aiming at the invasion at C8. This puts B ahead.]
;B[cf]C[B17. Not bad, but B might better consider playing at E6 (with Sente) instead since W will certainly not want to allow a following B play @ F4.]
;W[cl]C[W18. As expected (I hope). If not, why not? This is the obvious followup to W16.]
;B[en];W[el];B[dl]C[B21. Cutting into the opponent's 1-point center skip like this is, except in spcial circumstances, almost always a bad idea! One interesting idea here is to play F4 to contain the W corner. It's also feasible to simply jump to E10.]
;W[dm];B[dk];W[dn];B[em];W[cm];B[fl]C[B27. As a result of the improvident B21, not only has White been given a large corner in Sente, but B is also saddled with the necesssity of watching for a later ladder breaker! This is a disaster for B!]
;W[ql]C[W28. Misses all of the key points, and gives B an unearned chance to get back into the game. Best would be F5, to make the W corner really big! Another posssibility, although not as good, is B16, consolidating the upper left corner while aiming at a later C12. O3 is also good for W.]
;B[ef]C[B29. At F4 is better. The text isn't urgent. In any event, the slide to B16 first takes territory in  Sente!]
;W[hc]C[W30. Not small, but also not urgent. With both this and B16 available to W if B plays first in this corner, W is already stable here and so can profitably play now as noted before.]
;B[fq]C[B31. For sure now, slide to B16 in Sente first! In any event, the text is too low and should be at F4.]
;W[fp]C[W32. Of course!];B[gp];W[eq]C[W34. Bad!!! Justifies B's play.  The extension to F5 is essential.]
;B[gp];W[eq];B[fo]C[B37. What happened to B35 and W36? I get 2 blank moves here. In any event, this is correct and, thanks to the  simply awful W34 Black is now back in the game yet again.]
;W[ep];B[gq]C[B39. Not strictly necessary, pure Gote, and the wrong connection in any event! (If you're going to connect, at G5 avoids all future problems, and H5 makes good shape albeit with the bad Aji of the peep left behind. Instead, you could slide to B16 to induce W's C17, then play M4 with a magnificent game. Even M4 directly is far superior to the text, because as long as W20 can be captured W's potential cut at G5 should fizzle.]
;W[mq]C[W40. This is huge, once again thanks to B's miscue!];B[bd]C[B41. Well, at least it's still Sente!]
;W[cc];B[jc]C[B43. Played as though this were a high handicap game instead of an even one! What about trying the nasty probe at L3?? This is Sente and would put W on the spot to live here, or run away with advantage to B. Another very good idea here is P13, expanding B's moyo while compressing W's.]
;W[he]C[W44. If W is going to play in this area, at G14 is correct. The text is too slow. But this area isn't urgent. W could play P2 to induce Q2, then S6 to induce S5 in Sente while expanding his own potential first in any event. Then O14 is a good point, expanding W's moyo while limiting B's.]
;B[rc]C[B45. Big and solid to be sure, but premature IMHO. As noted before, L3 is still interesting, and P13 is even better than before.]
;W[iq]C[W46. Consolidates his weak group, but W should play the slides noted above with Sente first.

He might also consider O14 after the slides instead.];B[cd]C[B47. If you're going to play in this corner, the simple B17 is better, but now P13 is best. B might also consider sliding to O2 first, since W will almost certainly respond.]
;W[bc];B[de];W[ed];B[ek]C[B51. Now the error at 39 comes home to roost, as B is

suddenly concerned about the cut at G5! But if W tries to escape via E9, then the simple Geta at F10 traps him (Yes, he can temporarily "escape" but in the end he has no local prospects). The correct local continuation now is G13 to seal off your moyo and trap W20 on a large scale, and if B is really concerned about the cut, then why not simply play directly to prevent it? As played, that bad Aji still remains intact! In any event, none of this should work for W yet, so B is better advised to play at P13 now.]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[fh]C[W54. The best point for reduction IMHO, but a bit premature. Better now is to first play the slides noted above, followed by O14 to expand W's moyo while flattening B's.]
;B[gf]C[B55. Correct locally is at G13.];W[hh];B[hf];W[ie];B[jg]C[B59. Better at K12. The text makes it too easy for W to make shape.]
;W[gj]C[W60. W doesn't have a consistent objective here. Since he should simply be trying to reduce B's large potential moyo, teh attachment at K12 is the safest way to accomplish this.]
;B[of]C[B61. Right idea, wrong move, wrong timing! At P13 at least retains Sente, as noted earlier (aiming at the attachment at R13, while extending further). The text is Gote, and this makes a big difference! In any event, B at J11 first is called for.]
;W[re]C[W62. Too slow, and inappropriate to boot! This should be the losing move.  At K11 now is called for.]
;B[jj]C[B63. Q12 now increases B's moyo in Sente, because W can't allow R12. But first, to attack the 3 stones, J11 is still the best move.]
;W[ij]C[W64. Attaching at K12 is still better.];B[ii];W[ik];B[hi];W[gi]
;B[hj]C[B69. Inherently dangerous because it reduces B's own liberty count! B's error here is due to having the wrong objective! Instead of trying to kill the W stones, he should be trying to use his attack on them to build his moyo in the right center. Correct now is the simple J12, threatening to push through and cut with impunity. Then, after W connects via G9, B can follow with Q12 as previously noted. Also, the lower right hand corner is starting to get critical, as W builds strength nearby.]
;W[hk];B[gk]C[B71. Instead of this, it's  still better for B to simply go back to J11. Then when W connects, B @H12 leaves W with a large eyeless, weak group for B's pleasure in attacking while he profits in the upper right center. This would be a winning scenario for B.]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[ih];B[ji];W[jh]C[W76. Now, as a result of B's improvident and premature cut, it is B's own stones which are in trouble here! In addition, B must once again begin toworry about the (later) potential W cut at G5. This is a perfect example of how to lose a game!]
;B[hl]C[B77. Putting your head in the lion's mouth and hoping that he doesn't sneeze! At L12 is necessary (not to catch the W stones, but to give the B ones a fighting chance, although tht might be the result).]
;W[kh]C[W78. A mistake. At K9 is necessary. If  then B78, the W stones escape easily.]
;B[kf]C[B79. What's this?? A major error! It's the 5 weak B stones that need attention now! Correct is the Geta tesuji of K8!!! If you don't know or understnd this tesuji, now is the time to study it! Here, it wins outright (because the 3 W stones are then captured in a short ladder if they try to escape)!! After that, Black has no weak group to look after, but White still has, and this changes the dynamic of all of the rest of the game. (Even if this tesuji didn't capture the 3 W stones, it would result in strenghtening Black's own weak group enough to still change the game's dynamic in B's favor.)]

W84. Very bad technique! J7 is tesuji.];B[hm];W[im]C[

 cjo 7k*: no matter];B[km]C[B87. At J6 is correct, and, although the W stones will escape, B can strengthen his own weak stones in Sente.]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[jn]C[W90. Exploiting the potential cut at G5, but not best despite that.  Instead, N8 leaves B's weak group in desperate shape.]
;B[gn]C[B91. Pure Gote! Ostensibly, the point of B79 was to follow at P12 to attack the weak W group, and now B has that chance, so why not do it? You can always go back to protect this cut, since W can only make it in Gote, and after B's P12 there's obviously no time for that!]
;W[oo]C[W92. Excruciatingly Slow. The strongest way to continue is at N8. As played, B has room to maneuver while W's own still unsettled group isn't aided at all.]
;B[nj]C[B93. P12 is still feasible, but this is safer, with W92 in place.]
;W[ni];B[oj]C[B95. M11 first is a prudent "free" strenghtening move.];W
[ph]C[W96. Now the large W group is almost entirely safe, so W can attack B with relative impunity - a great scenario for him!]
;B[pm]C[B97. Induces W @ Q8, which isn't good for B. At P7 would be better. As before, interpolating M11 is still prudent.]
;W[qm]C[W98. Too passive, albeit solid territorially. W should push at Q8.]
;B[pn];W[pl]C[W100. At O7 is far more interesting, while M6 builds  a nice moyo for W. The text looks toward a tactical coup - an iffy prospect at best.]
;B[ol]C[

 cjo 7k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[om]C[W102. Better at O7 to force B's conection, then W can follow at M6 to make a large territory.]
;B[on]C[B103. Very bad! At O8 is Sente, and gives B the chance to live in the center with a modest territory.]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[mn];W[mk]C[W108. O.K., but good enough for W is to simply atari at P9, and if B extends follow him and then swallow up B93,95, sacrificing W102,4,6.]

B119. So B gets the 3 stones after all!];W[oi];B[ng];W[nh];B[mf]C[B123. Tiny! And Gote as well.  Instead, B can play the Sente sequences of B J18, W H18, B A17, etc., followed by S6, etc., then slide to O2, and finally take Gote with O4.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[rn];B[ro];W[pp]C[W128. Instead, W should first play the Sente yose sequences beginning at J18, T17, T5, P2, and A16.]
