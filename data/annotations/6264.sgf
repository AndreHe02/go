C[In this SGF, I record the thoughts I had as I was playing.  When I show a line of play or comment that something is miai, I'm not second-guessing your reading ability.  Rather, I'm showing you what was on my mind so you can get a better feel for the types of things I'm considering.  This may help you give more appropriate advice.

Also, please comment on my biggest weakness(es), which I should focus on correcting.  (Not specific moves, but more general stuff, like direction of play or playing more lightly/thickly.

Thanks so much for the review.

___

No problem.
I think I answered all your questions. Sometimes I get a bit excited and make some funny comments. Dont take them the wrong way. I've included some general stuff you should work on below.


Alright guy heres the scoop. You need to be more controlling. You yielded to your opponent's every move from 7 through to 26.

Also don't be afraid of losing stones.
All the play around moves 70-78 cost you more stones, made you weaker and made black stronger.
Then again at move 96

Anyone's reading can always improve and your eye for weakness as well.

Your opponent took advantage of a lot of cutting points.
The solution? Don't leave a cutting point unless you have already thought of a way to deal with it.

I learned a lot from reviewing your game.
Thank you!];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[pj];W[cf];B[dj]CR[cc]
[fc][bd]C[I haven't studied joseki yet.  I'm still working on basic principles.  I have Kogos' Joseki dictionary to study from, but I'd like more abstract advice (e.g. objectives to be aiming for) on these next few moves.

Blacks D10 is too far from your C14 to be considered an attack.  It's open enough to play locally, but your welcome to play elsewhere as there is no pressure on your C14 stone.

Locally, you could play any of the marked moves.

What you don't want is a black extention towards D4

I might play something like the variation]
(;W[ef];B[fd]C[What should be my next goal??  Pressure D10 or lean on F16?
If I lean on F16, maybe I can later follow up with C17 and force him to make a wall facing my already present row14.  Then after I take G14, he'll take H16 and I can focus on D10 with extra strength.

Your present goal should be taking some points and influence along the top.

Your left is stifled, so it's hard to make points. Black on the other hand is making point along the top. You need points too so why not make some while getting in black's way?]
;W[gf];B[hf]LB[fh:A][fi:B]C[Ouch!  Where'd that come from?  Maybe something like the variation below?  No -- I can't find a good follow-up.
So, A or B?....

This move is atrocious. Its effect on your group and the board in general are weak.  Don't even worry about moves like this. Your Row14 group isn't in any danger but if you play locally black will have the option of playing topside to make huge moyo.

The best thing to do is ignore this move and play top side. (SEE VAR)]

(;W[fh];B[hh]LB[lc:a][mc:a]C[Is it okay to let him extend the wall and gain center influence?  Yeah -- I can probably invade around a and survive.

You definitly want to invade. In the big picture black is controlling a lot more board than you.]
;W[fj];B[hj]C[Need a big point or to enclose his stone.];W[em]
C[This is a bad move because it doesn't stop black from living. And it doesn't develop any territory for you.

Lots of options for black life. (SEE VAR)]
(;B[hm];W[hq]C[This move should have been top side. You need to make some points while wiggling into black's moyo.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[ap];W[bn];B[br]C[He should have taken D3.  I can't read a kill -- it seems he'll live under any attack.  Still, it's slow, so time for my invasion (which I feel is getting very urgent).

Yeah, no kill here. And yeah, he should have played D3];W[nc]
C[Finally!];B[pf];W[jd]C[Good.];B[hd];W[ic];B[hc];W[ne]C[This is all pretty great for you. I guess black didn't want his H-wall to be doing anything.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng]CR[jf][lg][lj]C[My next move felt horrible right after I made it.  Maybe I should have taken one of the marked points?

Yeah it was not a good move. You don't make points and black gets to pressure you while building some nice terrirory in combination with this Q10 stone.

K14 would be best locally. Q18 is also an option. Or playing elsewhere.]

(;W[mg];B[mh];W[lq];B[pm];W[cc]C[I read the two alternate lines.]

(;B[cd];W[bd];B[dc]LB[bc:A]C[I think A was correct.];W[be];B[bc]
;W[cb];B[bb]C[Dead.  How can I use these guys to gain profit elsewhere?  I know...

Check it. (SEE VAR)]
(;W[hb];B[gb]C[Well... I guess not.  Oh well.  I could defend at J18, but that seems small, and I think the top group still lives.

I think you were wise not to defend.
You're correct, it is too small.

I disagree with your next move. Black's moyo in the center is huge, you need a piece of that pie.

I like M6.]
(;W[qp]C[Finish corner seems big now, especially with Q7 poised.]
;B[oo];W[np];B[no]C[Opponent framework still too large (based on quick guess at score).  Must reduce.

YES];W[kn];B[km]
(;W[kl]C[This seems fun because if he pressures bottom stone, I can probably connect to top.  And if he pressures top, I can crawl toward N6

You can't connect to top if he plays properly.
This is a bad move. Your concern should be black huge right side. (SEE VAR ON MOVE 55)]

(;B[jm];W[ln];B[lm]C[Not as sweet as I'd planned.];W[lh]C[Trying to make something out of the top.]
;B[li]C[in this situation you can play stuff like this (See var)]

(;W[mi];B[nh];W[ki];B[lj];W[kj];B[kh]MA[kl][ki][kj]C[Ouch!  Didn't foresee that!  Well, the marked stones seem dead.  Perhaps N11 can be resurrected by the aji of the dead stones?

No N11 is beyond help];W[lg];B[jh]C[jeffguy [10k?\]: good play!

Yeah, you got owned.];W[mj]C[No.];B[lk];W[mk];B[ll]
(;W[mm];B[ml];W[nl];B[nk]MA[nl][mi][mj][mk]TR[pb][rm][jn]C[Or not.  Now it feels like these stones are dead too!  I'll try to save one at least, and maybe cut off black's iron pillar.

Your thinking is way too local here. There are other big plans on the board.

SUCH AS the marked points]
(;W[nn]C[This move should be N5. It accomplishes your feeble goal of saving one stone and stops the black extention into your turf.]
;B[mo]C[Clever.  Did not foresee this.

Yeah, this sucks for you.
Because of your previous move you lost this whole group.];W[mn]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[lp];B[jp]C[Uh oh.  Can I connect them to something???  I'll start be crawling to gain liberties.]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[io];B[hp]
(;W[pn]C[Too bad this didn't work out for you];B[on];W[om]C[Still not too late to escape out the back.]
;B[ol]CR[mi][mj][mk]C[Didn't see that.  Now maybe I can resurrect marked stones in exchange for that intolerable loss?

You know you can't.];W[ok];B[nm];W[nj];B[nl];W[oj]C[This is all terrible play. Let it go dude. Play bigger points.]
;B[pk]C[Or not.  Well maybe I can use the combine aji of all those dead center stones to crawl the right side a bit.  But this hurts so much, and I may have even lost the bottom side!]
;W[ql]C[You got lucky here. Black should have come down; because he didn't you were able to get the entire bottom side and all he got was your small group of 8 stones.]

(;B[ho];W[iq]
(;B[gq];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr]C[Too many cutting points.  I think if he'd played right, he could have killed a bunch of stuff on the bottom.

Definitely];B[mp];W[mq];B[nq];W[op];B[in];W[qm];B[po];W[qo]
;B[jn]
(;W[pi]C[Can they be pulled out?

What are you thinking?!
No!
NO.
NOOOO!

Black is wayyyy to strong here and your group is weak slow and heavy!]
;B[oi]CR[qe][oh][oe][of]C[I guess not.
I'm now looking toward a probe at one of these moves to try and heavily damage his corner.  But first, strengthen this stone.]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[rj]C[Q11 turned out useful, but it was lucky not skill.]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[pn]C[I can now do something like a monkey jump in his corner, no matter what he does.  But if D10 is pulled out, I lose.  (I didn't recount the score here.)

Yeah.  D10 still has lots of options.];W[fl];B[gm]C[Yay!  Defended without much gain for opponent!

If you want to study terrible moves, take a good look at black's move here. Atrocious!]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of]LB[oh:A]C[No. SEE VAR]
(;B[og];W[pg];B[ph]C[This response took me off guard.  I hadn't read the follow-up.  But once he played here, I saw the potential.]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ni]LB[pb:A][qc:B]C[Which side of the corner is best for me to move in?  I've often seen the exchange of A for B.  But that might actually kill him.  With anything else, I don't think he can do better than living small.

A is the only option. B results in death for you.];W[pb];B[oh]
C[What???? I didn't think those two stones mattered!!

They don't, another one of black's genious moves.];W[qf];B[me]
CR[of][ne][oe]C[Didn't see this cut.  Ouch.  Most important that marked stones live.  The corner is mine, I think.]
;W[md]C[jeffguy [10k?\]: nice cut!];B[le];W[ke];B[kg];W[ld]
;B[lf]C[I was concerned about the follow-up shown, so I defended.  I wasn't able to see farther than what's shown.]

(;W[pc];B[nd];W[od];B[rd]C[I can't believe you ended up with the entire right side. That was the result of poor play by your opponent.]
;W[qd];B[nr]C[Ouch!  I'd forgotten about all those cutting points.  I spent some time reading.  I think it turns into a capturing race along the lines of this alternate path, but I'm not able to read clearly enough.

Glad it worked out for you here.];W[mr];B[hr];W[ir];B[is];W[jr]
C[Hmm... if he doesn't defend, I can cut him up and maybe connect on the left.]
;B[gs]C[Oh!  And I guess if he does, I win the race!  Sweet!]
;W[or];B[ms];W[lr];B[ls]C[Huh?  Bad move!];W[oq];B[ks];W[ns]
;B[hs]C[Six points, gote.  I want those stones, but there's gotta be some better moves on the board.]
;W[jb]CR[fb]C[This seemed sente.  If he fails to defend, I take marked point.]
;B[ha]C[Oh.  Or not.  Maybe I should have played tenuki now.

Yes. Lots of moves worth more points.];W[ib];B[eo]C[I may be able to use those cut points as threats that will let me build the strength to cut off E5.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fr];B[gr];W[fo];B[fn];W[en]C[Yay!
Yep, that was good];B[js]CR[cq][br][ap][bp]C[Silly move.
Oh!  With this new strength, I can greatly diminish the marked stones.]
;W[dr]C[Before making this move, I read some, but missed the shown variation.]

(;B[fq];W[ep];B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[cr];B[bq]C[Dead!  But I misread, so I played another move.]
;W[ds];B[es]C[Lucky again here that you killed the corner group.]
