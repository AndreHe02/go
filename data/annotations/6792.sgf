Hi ! I'm jero your reviewer. 
you asked for an analysis about invading the lower right corner toward the end of the game. Actually, answering this question is possible much earlier. That' s the reason why my commentary begins  with W9.]
;W[qp];B[dc];W[oq];B[gq];W[pj];B[dj];W[jq];B[iq];W[mq]C[at this stage invading the lower right corner seems very risky for black : 
you can notice that the extension of R4 with P3 is a very solid move. (even without talking about N3 and K3) 

I think at most black could prevent white from making  more secure territory too easily on the right side of the board by playing toward  Q7. But it would certainly lead to a difficult fight for black when he doesn't need it taking into account the global situation on the board. (difficult because of white Q10)



let's notice that this invasion that i told you about (right side) will become almost impossible  later in the game .....]

;B[bj];W[bi];B[ai];W[ag];B[cj];W[af];B[oi]C[.... as i told you before Black66 starts a sequence of moves which makes completely secure the right side for White. Actually the sequence goes until Black86 when on the top of it black loses sente after making more  secure white moyo. 
The problem here is also that  black doesn't gain much with this sequence whereas white is in heaven.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[nj];B[mi]C[actually even if you stop the sequence here white is already well protected.]

;W[sh];B[sg];W[si];B[og];W[qj];B[mh]C[now white's wall is just unbreakable and it goes to the center ....]
;W[mj]C[... but too slowly i think 






ok so,  as you asked it my commentary was about the lower right corner and the possibility to invade it or not.  
As you can see my answer was negative. 
My advice for you would be to think more about strategy than invasion. You' ve played a good game relatively to your level but you have to keep in mind that your opponent made some big mistakes (White65 is a good example of it since it is completely unsignificant) and that's the reason why you won by more than 20 points.
You also have to stop playing moves like Black88 or black110 because they are too slow.]
