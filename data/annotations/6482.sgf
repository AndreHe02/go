C[Hello! I am Bernd Sambale, HonFu in the ladder and on KGS, where this game was played in August 2007.

My opponent used an opening strategy which I never saw until that day, and probably I didn't handle it right, because I fell behind and had a strategically lost game very early, with almost dead groups all around. If my opponent hadn't died big in the upper right, I would have lost this match.

Lately I kill more groups than before, but if I don't overcome my strategical lacks, I'll get into heavy trouble, as soon as my opponents start to play a little bit more careful.

So please, dear reviewer, help me out!

cg: Well, I'm not sure I agree with your analysis that you were behind in the beginning.  I think you played a bit passively but it was a close game during the opening.  Your invasion at q11 was slightly premature and you made an overplay at g3, but strategically you were okay.  I left specific comments in later moves.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pn];B[dp]C[cg: I was taught to always respond to an approach to a 4-4 stone.  Approach to a 3-4 stone can be ignored though.]

;W[pf];B[pb];W[qc];B[kc]C[cg: To here it looks about equal.  I have a slight preference for black.]
;W[ld]LB[lc:A][kd:B]C[cg: Consider variation B as well.  It gives up a lot in the top right but I think you'll gain more in the long run.  Variation A feels too passive to me, but is certainly OK.]

(;B[lc];W[kd]LB[ne:B][pi:A]C[cg: Now I feel white is starting to get an advantage, with a lot of potential toward the middle.  Black played very passively in the opening, making no pincers.  But still okay here since j4/f4 can be attacked.]

(;B[pi]TR[jc][ne]C[cg: This is too early.  Secure your top group in sente first, with one of the marked positions.]

;B[kp];W[ns];B[qr];W[cl]LB[cm:A][cn:B]C[cg: Variation B takes the corner, simply.  Variation A leaves many weak points, as you found out.]

(;B[cm];W[cj]LB[ch:A][dl:B]C[cg: Variation B feels stronger to me.  It secures the c7 group.  It gets black into the center, giving the m10 group a place to run to.  It attacks the c8 group.  Black has nothing to worry about in the top left.]

;B[jr];W[ks];B[fc];W[bf]LB[cc:A][cg:B]C[cg: c17 is so passive.  I would instead force white to live in the corner while making a stronger group with which to attack the k17 group.  After c17 you won't have that much in the corner anyway.  (Actually B should be at D13 if the plan is to attack white top center group.)]

;B[es];W[fr];B[br]LB[bc:A][cs:B]C[cg: See variation B.  c1 seems like a "must play" move, even though in the end it turns out black can live.]

(;W[bc];B[gf]C[cg: Passive.  This move only does one thing: gain a few points of territory.  Think big.  Attack entire top center group, starting at r15 then k15.  It doesn't hurt to play these forcing moves.]
;W[gc]LB[hc:B][fe:A]
(;B[fe]C[cg: Making it very easy for white.  h17.  Into the breach!  :-)  I know it's hard to read out h17, but the d16 group is strong and h17 has the support of L18 too.]
;W[gb];B[eb]C[cg: ??  If you want to play in this area at all, why is e18 better than e16 or f18?]
;W[la];B[ka];W[na];B[oa];W[ra]C[cg: Nice ko setup by white.]
