C[DrK: Dear Huo,

I will be your reviewer for this game. I note I will

1. focus on the black's moves;
2. try to focus on at least 3 things you can do to improve.

Before reading this review, I suggest you examine the following link - and try to use the same criterion to examine your own moves. This is especialy for our levels - I still find them useful and I am around 7k.

Enjoy!

(;B[op];W[qe]C[i guess 5/6 is somewhat of an equal trade, but maybe i should just complete the corner enclosure instead.

DrK: at our level (1k and below) this is fine. I will provide some brief comments on each possibilities.

This outcome is even for both black and white if you know how to continue...]

(;B[qd]C[thought this was the decent move, with black stone at bottom...

DrK: I like this move - because of the presence of P4. If P4 black stone is not there I would prefer O16 instead.]

(;W[pj]C[and an unexpected move from white! how to take advantage?

DrK: It is very rarely one can violate the go proverb - "develop corner before side" this is not one of them.

Look at the board - white's stone at Q10 does not help with top right position nor threaten P4 very much. So 

1. Do you need to reinforce a weak group - no.
2. Are there any weak groups black can attack - yes - R4 and R15. Which is more damaging - R15 - because you need 1 move to damage it's development potential.]

(;B[qh]C[maybe this is too close

DrK: R12 is overly aggressive. And it helps white to strengthen itself. It should be played after playin Q15.]
;W[ph]
(;B[qg];W[pf]C[DrK: (shake head) white plays poorly here - each stones on the right side can be disconnected easily. and Black S15 links up both top right groups together.]
;B[pg];W[nd]
(;B[lc]C[in retrospect, maybe i should have played the p15 move here and cut white apart from the get go.

DrK: Yes - P15 is my immediate thought - white so far played unreasonably.

But M17 isn't necessarily bad. I would only say it is not severe - it does not play to opponent's weakness (disconnected stones).]
;W[ld]
(;B[ic]C[DrK: This is the first mistake I consider for black's play. 

In this situation, black has a weak stone at M17 - it should reinforce.]
;W[mc];B[me]C[DrK: If there is a stone at L16 then this peep at N15 forcing white to connect at N16 would be effective. In this case this is a mistake because white does not have to connect.]
;W[kc]C[these fights seem so amateurish to me. white barely spent any time at all thinking this out and is just circling around

DrK: Not at all - white tries to make an 2 eyes and black try to disconnect and keep white off top left corner.]

(;B[lb]C[DrK: M18 is a waste - it is hard to save and instead black should try to keep white stones disconnected.]
;W[kb];B[mb];W[nb];B[md];W[nc]
(;B[kd]C[i think here i decided that my three stones were dead and I would just try to close off white and remove his eyespace.

DrK: the goal is fine. But you should read out the sequencce.

1. black has no ladder at M15 so that needs to be resolved first.
2. how to stop white from advancing to the left.];W[le];B[lf]
;W[ke];B[jd];W[la];B[kf]
(;W[ma]C[DrK: K15 should be played at once - close off all disconnected stones.]

(;B[ob];W[ib]C[white tries to get another eye]
(;B[ia]C[DrK: this move is not effective.]
(;W[ha];B[ja]C[DrK: this move is also ineffective if white plays correctly...]

;B[gb];W[id];B[je];W[lc];B[oe];W[if];B[ie];W[jc];B[he]C[however, white still doesn't have two real eyes.

DrK: Yeah - but white can break out in at least 3 ways...]
(;W[mf];B[ne];W[od]C[wanted to play the best move to simultaneously reinforce the corner and separate white.]

(;B[pd];W[pe]
(;B[of]C[and here i stop paying attention and inadvertently give white a way to survive]
;W[og];B[re];W[nf]
(;B[cj]C[wanted to go down here for a while now, guessed now would be safe

DrK: Actually ... black has several weak groups...];W[cl]
(;B[cg]C[top left looks pretty nice now];W[mq]
(;B[on]C[was taking it easy and thinking through my moves, so i was in byoyomi at this point. feels like diving into the corner here is a bit narrow; not sure if this is the best response though.]

(;W[kj]C[welp, i guessed i better protect my stuff (with a potential for connection below?) and to avoid giving white more central influence]

(;B[jg];W[hg]C[in retrospect, i could have done something different here, like play k14 directly and perhaps gain sente]

(;B[hf];W[ig];B[jf];W[jh]
(;B[ih];W[ii];B[hh];W[gg]C[squeezing out that white toothpaste]

(;B[ji];W[kh];B[ij];W[hi];B[gh];W[jj];B[ik];W[gi];B[fh]C[black toothpaste this time. interestingly, white chooses to protect their already safe group]

DrK: Then follow up with an attack at bottom right corner - otherwise black group O6 dies...]

(;B[lk];W[kk];B[mk]C[and now i start to figure i can capture this unwieldy group

;W[ls];B[ns];W[os];B[ol];W[pm];B[lj]C[i guess got a bit stressed out by the timer and played my threat too early, made me lose my bottom group.]
;W[ki];B[lh];W[nl];B[li];W[no];B[kg]C[not really sure what to do at this point, just playing some random forcing moves

;W[io];B[jn];W[jp];B[fk];W[fl];B[ej];W[gn];B[ei];W[fk];B[fn]
;W[en]C[oh well!

DrK: Conclusion - 

I believe black would benefit from:

1. do lots of tsumego;
2. study this page - basic instincts - a guide on what you may consider doing - especially with respect to when to hana ...

http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicInstinct

3. read go book - I recommend "Lessons in the Fundamental Principles of Go" by Kageyama Toshiro or "In the beginning" by Iwamoto Kaoru or "The second book of go".

4. This goes without saying - learn to manage your time well - your last 20 moves were a bit aimless - clearly due to time pressure - which is okay. Play more games.

Good luck in playing!
