C[Hello, Craig.

My name is Bernd, I am HonFu here in the ladder and on KGS (1k).

First of all I am full of respect for how much time you spent on your personal analysis! Even the cross-references to Go-World with pro opinion and all ... 

When I review a game or study, I always try not to know more and more details, but to look at some crucial moments and to simplify the complicate matters in a way that they are easily graspable - which is kind of the opposite approach to yours. 

Yet I hope, that what I have to say will help you anyway. If questions remain, you can find me easily on KGS:]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]LB[de:C][po:A][qo:B]C[While I "know" that an approach around 5 is best I don't have a clear understanding as to why it is better than a play at A or B.

My guess is that an approach around 5 works better with Black's two existing stones than an approach around C.

Putting the above into concrete statements:
A) While both approaches (5 and C) work to limit White's potential only an approach around 5 also aims at expanding Black's potential.
B) An approach around A by White may be met by a pincer helping to develop the upper right.

Hon: To put it in a simple way - playing or preventing a shimari is big. But preventing a shimari in the lower left is a double-purpose-move, because it extends from Q3. That's what makes it biggest. 

Playing B would help your Q16 stone somewhat, but the shimari would point into the wrong direction to have a good development.]
;W[hp]LB[qo:A]C[White usually makes an approach around A before responding in the bottom left. This seems logical to me as an immediate approach will probably be met by a pincer but an approach played later may give Black other strong options.

Hon: You can also see white's move at A as miai - you prevented his shimari, he prevents yours. After his pincer you have the option of leaving e3 as it is and play A yourself. As a tendence often you attack or defend any single stone on an assymetrical point (3-4, 3-5, 4-5), and THEN you start with the next phase of fuseki - joseki.]
;B[en];W[cn];B[do]LB[co:A][jp:B][kp:C][cq:D]C[After White A Yang Yilun gives B as the best local play but C seems to be the pincer of choice.

As an aside; while Yang Yilun 7p  considers W8 to be a 'trick play', in Go World 87, while annotating the game Cho Chikun - Yoda Norimoto, game one of the 24th Meijin Titile match, Kudo Norio 9p simply calls it a new move and states that D (the move played) is a popular response. Yang gives D as an error.

After C Black normally gets sente to take the next big point. I expect that to be an approach in the upper left as attacking a White approach move in the bottom right will allow Black to take territory at the bottom in sente.

Hon: Joseki science is not my strong part. I don't think we can handle the nuances of pro thinking anyway at our levels. 

Important for us is that we want to start a counter attack against H4 later. This is enough.]
;W[co];B[kp]LB[hm:B][po:A]C[I was expecting a continuation like B. I think Black is for choice in either case but Black's game seems easy after A.

Hon: If white jumps (what seems logical to me), then L4 was sente and black can play A. Probably white thought, H4 has enough space to settle one way or another later. But jumping seems normal to me.]

(;W[po]LB[hm:B][po:A];B[np]C[This is why I think White 6 should have been played around 12. Now White is hurting his H4 stone.]
;W[qk]LB[qq:A]C[This is just weak. Of course A is better. To bad I didn't do a better job of punishing this as it would have been nearly game over!

Hon: Hmm. Game over you say? I have made the experience that normally - on non-pro level - we don't lose games because we made one slack move. 

Also, this move DOES something, it confronts the influence of the hoshi stone. It's a light extension and I would not call it a losing move, even if it was locally inferior.]

(;B[qo];W[nc]C[Hon: Funny, to leave Q5 like this. At least the hane he should play, then tenuki.]
;B[qf];W[jd]
(;B[cf]LB[pb:B][cf:A][qi:A]C[Perhaps A would have been stronger.

Hon: I am not sure. He has already played lightly in that area, tenukiing after R5. So maybe he can afford to tenuki after A even, since you play too many stones in this area.

For the corner shape, personally I would like B, which takes the corner safely. You can't play it though, since it is too slow now. You would need a good excuse - for example a white move at R12. (See earlier variations.)]

(;W[ch]C[Hon: Wrong joseki.];B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[dd];W[bc];B[cb];W[de];B[ed];W[ce];B[bb];W[fe];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[ec];W[df]LB[qi:A]C[35. R11 would have been much stronger, punishing White for his attempted trick play.

Hon: This joseki was a very bad choice by white. His moyo at the top is in shambles now. (See my joseki variation.)]

(;B[pb]LB[pb:A][qi:B];W[qn];B[qp];W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[fn];W[qh]
;B[pn]C[Black has obviously failed at punishing White's move 14.

White has about 40 points vs. Black's 50.

White's position at the top is still quite loose and if his H4 stone is unable to escape Black's territory at the bottom will be huge.

I think Black is better but this is still a game.

Hon: I think, Q6 is small. It only helps white to strengthen with R7. You should leave this now and rather keep the option of something like R7 instead, which would not cut off one single stone in gote, but weaken the whole group. Never go for single stones in close fights (except they cut apart two heavy groups of your own)! 

I wonder, why H4 is still alive, by the way. It really should be quelled and killed!]
;W[qm];B[on];W[fl]C[Hon: Okay for you. Gives you an excuse to kill the stone.]

(;B[hm]C[Hon: This looks shy to me, since white can, if he is crazy, still play stuff like J6 or K5.]
;W[nl]LB[mm:C][ln:A][mn:B]C[Here I decided that it would be unwise to be greedy about territory at the bottom as White's influence could easily become overwhelming.

During the game I only considered moves at A and B but C might have enabled me to secure a big territory at the bottom without giving away the entire center.

Hon: I am not sure about the exact choice, but if you want the points, C seems best to me. 

The point here is, that you already invested a carload of stones on the bottom. If now H4 manages to escape somehow, your stones will be heavily overconcentrated. So after playing so many stones here, you should make safe you get as many points as possible from them (especially after the mistake at Q, and please also consider that, if H7 was at J5, then white's move would not be anything like sente)]

(;B[hk]LB[hk:A][mm:B];W[ko]C[Hon: Now the trouble starts.];B[jp]
C[Hon: I also thought of this move immediately. Makes it hardest for him to connect or make shape.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[ip]

;W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[ks]
;W[mp]
(;B[lo]C[Hon: Don't go after just a few stones which he can afford to sacrifice!]
;W[mo];B[ln];W[no]LB[nm:A]C[If Black trys to cut with A he loses the capture race.]

(;B[oo]LB[nm:B][oo:A];W[nm];B[lm];W[mm]C[Hon: I think this is not too good for black. White could not hope for much in this area, but now he has entered the lower side and is already in no trouble. The corner will be reduced more later.]
;B[gc]C[Hon: Hmm. Looks slow, but is probably enough, since even after his invasion, you are ahead. He should have escaped with H4 in time.]
;W[hd]
(;B[lk]LB[lc:C][bd:D][gj:A][cr:B]C[Hon: For this move others seem bigger to me, like the marked ones. (See variation for A.)]
;W[jj]C[Hon: Wow. He is reducing your smallest territory. This is a move you should just ignore.]
;B[lf]LB[hi:A]C[I think this move caused me difficulties later but it also caused White problems.

Maybe A would have been better?

Hon: Your move is hanging in midair, having no clear purpose. It is not sente against anything, doesn't build strong influence, doesn't take points, doesn't destroy points ... tenukiing was good, but this move looks like you answered a nonsensical move with another one.]
;W[ne];B[lh];W[lj]
(;B[kk]LB[kj:A]C[After White A Black seems to have an easy game.

Hon: With your peep you help him to connect, which in fact builds strength against your stones at M14 and M12. I think, one should not play this.

I prefer any of my variations, which are not really careful developed lines, but do not strengthen white with no need like your peep.]

(;W[mj]LB[kj:B][mj:A];B[ig];W[hi]C[The exchange of 85 for 86 was to White's benefit.
I think I should have played H11 myself followed by the cut at L10 as in the game.

Hon: Might be right, but I think the real problem was rather your peep at L9.]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[ji];B[mk];W[nk];B[of];W[mh];B[mg];W[mi]
LB[oh:A]C[Perhaps 97. at A would have been stronger as White's attempt to cut fails.]

(;B[og]LB[og:A][oh:B];W[kg];B[lg];W[jg];B[gj]C[White's position at the top has too many holes to make it a priority for Black while the left side could be consolidated into a huge territory with a single move. This also attempts to derive some value from 85.

Hon: He is behind one way or another.];W[fi];B[gi];W[gh];B[fj]
;W[ei]
(;B[ej];W[er]C[I am not certain I handled this properly. It seemed that White was giving up more than he gained so I didn't sweat it overly much.

Hon: I would see it like this: You have spent many stones to make points here, so if he now takes those points away and lives here, then all those moves were useless. 

You have 20 points here, you shouldn't just give them away easily!]

(;B[dq];W[fq];B[dr];W[fo];B[dn];W[gr];B[es];W[fs];B[fr];W[dp]
;B[ep];W[er];B[fp];W[ds];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr];W[ng]LB[nh:A]C[I didn't like White forcing me to capture before he retook the ko as I didn't want to lose some of my options on the right side.

Hon: Locally it looks like black got tricked. You were the boss at the bottom and had him cleanly killed. Now you got a ko on your hands and can make life. But, he paid a lot allowing you to play D6. I see trouble coming here. 

Still, I think, you should just have taken the points at the bottom. Don't go for crazy stuff when you're clearly ahead.]

(;B[nf]LB[nf:A][nh:B];W[fq]LB[hq:A]C[The variation starting with 129. H3 didn't occur to me until I got here. I think Black would still have the advantage but I prefered the position after 129. C2.
In exchange for the territory given up (about 12 points) Black gets some of the corner, probably in sente and a few big ko threats of indeterminate value.

Hon: If you can manage to take apart the whole left side, I would agree. But I can't see why you should give up the whole bottom for a move at C2, which you could have had earlier.]

(;W[mb]LB[mb:A][pc:B];B[na];W[qc];B[pc]C[While exchanging 148 for 149 allows White to reduce my corner territory it strengthens my position and makes caging the Monkey imperative.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[rg];B[or]C[This was why I played 145. N19 instead of M17. I wanted to reduce or invade the top while maintaining sente for P2.

Exchanging 150 and 152 for 151 and 153 seems bad for White as I still have sente at the top.]
;W[ib]C[White 154 must be a mistake as it threatens to do less damage to me than I can now do to him.]

[bq:C]C[After the better 166. at A White's position is still hopeless as Black still has many sente threats, B-E, as well as F which makes White work to just keep his stones alive.

In fact Black's position in the upper right is already quite strong. Solidifying the corner territory and making an invasion at the top even stronger probably isn't enough to make 39. Q18 better than 39. E8.

Hon: If you play R11, you only give the weak stones an excuse to settle like this. Since you're the boss in this area anyway, settling is enough for him. The extension at R6 (variation) seems to have still been good, setting up the inducing-sequence shown earlier.]

Should Black play in the bottom right immediately to take advantage of White's omission or should he play a move like C knowing that he will get to play two moves in a row elsewhere if White comes back to defend?

I am uncertain which is better for Black, A or B, so I think Black C would be my choice.

Hon: There's an easy principle - when you're weak, hane, when you're strong, extend. Playing B leaves white the least opportunity for sabaki, so it is better. After the hane at A he can try to settle with a crosscut. (For B see variation.)

By the way - D is large, since white did not play there. If he runs, he or the complete group on the right might die a natural death in a double attack.]
