C[
cj: Hello, thanks for the review.  I need help strengthening my groups and avoiding traps.  Any advice would be great.  I am 15k KGS and I'm playing as white in this game.

[gromit\] Hi, I'll do my best to provide useful comments, if some points remain unclear, please don't hesitate to contact me.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]TR[nc][jd][jp][mp]C[cj: I'm not sure how to approach this.

[gromit\] There are plenty of ways :)
Either approach one of the corners directly, or simply extend on one of the common borders.]
;W[qf]C[[gromit\] Approcahing from inside is possible too, but is usually more complicated.]
;B[qh]TR[qe][re]C[[gromit\] The usual R15 or S15 answer seemed more natural for B.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[pm]CR[qh][pk]TR[ld][mf]C[cj: I feel that I did this too early.

[gromit\] Yes, the upper group is still far from "out", better exchange at least one more jump: this will put more pressure on the B marked stone and relieve the pressure on the W group.]
;B[po];W[om]TR[ol][nm]C[[gromit\] heavy :( Why not simply jump or kosumi (the kosumi will prevent a B connection underneath)]
;B[oh];W[mf];B[ld];W[qk]TR[mh]C[[gromit\] The direction should be to seal B in and get W out, not to try to live underneath, which will strengthen B anyway.]
;B[qj];W[ql];B[rj];W[jc]TR[ke]C[[gromit\] W is creating yet another weak group! if B just splits W it will become very difficult.]
;B[jd];W[mc];B[md];W[oc];B[od]CR[rd][mf][of][qf]TR[kg]C[[gromit\] W is still not alive on the top border but his marked group is now very very weak!!! A B move around L13 would be painful.]
;W[lc];B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[oa];B[pb];W[ma];B[pa]C[[gromit\] small...]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ra];W[qd];B[mh];W[rh];B[ri]
TR[rg]C[[gromit\] Capturing would have worked...];W[rg];B[pe]
;W[pf];B[kg]C[[gromit\] W dead :(];W[gc]C[[gromit\] small: all on third line]
;B[kf];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi];B[qi];W[ok];B[ni];W[oj]
(;B[re]C[cj: Are my northeast stones now dead or were they dead before?

[gromit\] dead before (see var) And they died because of your invasion of the top border...]
;W[qe];B[se];W[sf];B[sh];W[qo]TR[ll][no]C[[gromit\] This is a small contact play.  The W group should look out for safety, not in]
;B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[rk];B[mp]C[[gromit\] A bit too close];W[kh]
;B[lh]TR[lg]C[[gromit\] The marked move seemed simpler...];W[lg]
;B[lj];W[ki];B[kj];W[ii];B[lm];W[li];B[mi]TR[mj]C[[gromit\] B really doesn't want to connect?]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[mk];B[nk];W[ml];B[nl];W[ol];B[mm];W[jj];B[kk]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[cm]TR[dj]C[[gromit\] W now needs to think on a bigger scale to balance things out.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[jq];W[ho]C[[gromit\] yes!];B[fo];W[en]CR[cm]
TR[hm]C[[gromit\] W should continue to jump, ahead of B, W already added a move on the left and cannot allow B to get ahead in the race.]
;B[fn];W[dq]TR[gm][hm]C[[gromit\] If B caps now, W in big trouble! W should have played there before, if B has to live underneath W will make a very big left side territory.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[em];W[hm]C[[gromit\] Yes!!!];B[fl];W[dn]TR[dk]
C[[gromit\] This was only one gote eye for B, better deprive him from a second one or achance to attack the W stones...]
;B[gm];W[hl];B[dl];W[ek];B[el];W[cl]TR[dk]C[[gromit\] The other side might have been more severe]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[fk];W[ej];B[fj];W[dj];B[fi]
(;W[ch]C[[gromit\] Side is not urgent, helping W centre group is! (see vars for examples)]
;B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[il];B[gl];W[jn]TR[gn]C[[gromit\] W has to keep in mind that the marked spot is vital for B...]
;B[kn];W[ko];B[lo];W[jo];B[kp];W[iq];B[jp];W[ip];B[gn];W[hn]
;B[hi];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh]TR[gp]C[[gromit\] not necessary: W had two half eyes (marked spot is one too).]
;B[if];W[ce];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb];B[he];W[nm];B[nn];W[on]
;B[oo];W[no]TR[pj]C[cj: This seemed to be hopeless.  I should have strengthened my east group first, at least, right?

[gromit\] The right side group is weak, but I think it lives (one eye and a half under plus one half at the marked spot... or may be seki?)]
;B[mn];W[np];B[op];W[nq];B[oq];W[lq];B[mq]
(;W[lr]TR[jr]C[[gromit\] Marked spot better, see vars.];B[jr]
;W[lp];B[mr];W[nr];B[or];W[ir]
(;B[ls]C[[gromit\] Big mistake by B (see vars).];W[ks];B[kr]
;W[ms];B[mo];W[js];B[ns];W[kq]C[cj: This was totally unecessary, I wasted a move getting caught in the moment.

[gromit\] yes.];B[pj];W[rm]C[cj: Could this group have been saved here?

[gromit\] Yes, see later...];B[pn];W[qn];B[pl];W[qm];B[sn]
(;W[ng]C[[gromit\] huh?!? Why not continue, you have a seki (see var)]

;B[lk];W[so];B[sl];W[na]TR[sk]C[cj: I must have done this out of frustration.

[gromit\] Well, you could still live...];B[la]
(;W[ka]C[[gromit\] The connection was still possible...];B[mb]
;W[lb];B[ma];W[ja];B[sk];W[ep];B[jg];W[sp];B[rq];W[go];B[fp]
;W[dm];B[ik];W[jl];B[ls];W[pg];B[ll]C[cj: The rest doesn't matter.  Thanks again for the review.

[gromit\] You're welcome.

I think you have a lot of progression possible just by working on Life and Death. Then, try to avoid beeing jealous, it makes you create lots of weak groups early in the game. Just build your own territory, let the other invade and attack :)
