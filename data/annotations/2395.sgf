C[I will preface my review comments with my initials <SC>];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic]C[<SC>:
This looks like Black is using a Chinese opening.  This implies that Black
intends to try building a large Moyo based on the stones along the top.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qd]TR[nc]SQ[pi]C[Was this a good move?
White responds on q10 which is a very good move.

<SC>:
This is not the best choice.  This move only serves to defend the corner.
 Look for moves that do more than one job at the same time.  A pincer around
q11 serves to attack white and establish Black on the right side.  See variation.
 

<SC>: Defending at o17 is not quite as good, since it doesn't
directly attack white.  O17 is still better than the current move.  In the
current situation, White could still invade around o17.];W[pj]
;B[nq]C[<SC>:
I would prefer an approach move in the lower left corner. The white stone
there has less support than the lower right stone.];W[lq];B[pq]
SQ[qq]C[<SC>:
Usually, Black would play on the 3x3 point, but White's passive response
made this work out fine for Black.];W[op]C[White could attack better by playing at r3]
;B[oq];W[mo]C[<SC>: This move should also be at r3];B[qp];W[qo]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[qq]C[<SC>:
Black could wait to connect here, but doing it now will probably save trouble
later.  If your game is going well, then take time to fix defects like this.
 If you are behind and desperate, then you can skip moves like this and keep
attacking.];W[pn];B[cn]C[<SC>: good.];W[nc]SQ[qd]C[<SC>: Black's move number 7 at r16 allowed this invasion.]
;B[oc]SQ[fq][qh]C[<SC>:
This is probably the best local defense.  This does seem to be a rather small
move for the opening, however.  Remember to look at the whole board for the
best overall move.  A second approach move at f3 is a good thought.  Invading
White at r12 is also worth considering.  The current move at p17 isn't bad,
I just want you to step back and look at the whole board before you automatically
respond right next to your opponent's last play.];W[ne];B[nb]
SQ[ed][dj][fq]C[<SC>:
The three Black stones in the upper right corner are secure enough for now.
 Use this move to make a bigger move.  F3, E16 and D10 are big points to
play now.];W[mc]
(;B[cp]C[<SC>: The 3x3 point is better.  Even
if White splits Black, Black can still expect a good outcome.  See variation.]
;W[cq];B[do];W[bp];B[ep]C[<SC>: This is better than connecting at c5.]
;W[dq]
(;B[eq]SQ[eo]C[<SC>: Bad.  This is reaching too far.  Go back and fix some defects instead.  E5 is best.  See variation.]
;W[eo]C[<SC>: Now things get complicated]
(;B[fo]SQ[ep][eq]C[<SC>: I think h3 is better to defend the two marked stones.  See variation.]
;W[en];B[co]SQ[fo][ep][eq]C[<SC>:
This makes an empty triangle.  Empty triangles are generally bad unless you
are making an eye.  Locally, Black should sacrifice the stone at c4 and extend
down the side instead.  There is more to consider, however.  When you have
two weak groups like this situation, it is usually impossible to defend both
at once.  Pick one group to defend and be ready to sacrifice the other. The
three marked stones look at bit stronger, so I think you should defend them.
J3 looks good for this purpose.];W[cm]C[<SC>: The four Black stones at c5 are a lost cause now.  Leave them and move on.]
;B[fn]C[<SC>: The black stones need a base along the side.  J3 is still a good way to do this.]
;W[em];B[jq]C[<SC>:
I think that this is one space too far and leaves room for white to jump
in around h3.  Before you place a stone, try to visualize how the board will
look after you play and try to imagine your opponent's response.  In this
case, Black's stone at k3 seems to cry out for an White invasion at h3.]
;W[hq]
(;B[ho]SQ[hq]C[<SC>:
The space above the marked white stone is too large to close off completely.
 So, Black can't expect to surround this stone before it moves out into the
middle.  Black again has two weak groups, one at k3 and another around e4-f5.
 Pick one to defend and leave the other alone.  See variation.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[kq];W[lp]TR[hq][ip][jp]SQ[kp]
[kq][jq]C[<SC>:
The marked Black stones have fewer liberties than the marked white stones.
 Black should expect to lose any capturing races here, so don't try to save
the Black stones.  Instead, force White to capture them while strengthening
your other stones in the area.];B[io]C[<SC>: This is a good forcing move.  I would expect white to respond at j3.]
;W[fp]C[<SC>: Unexpected, this is.];B[fq];W[gp];B[hp]TR[fp]
[gp]SQ[ip][jp]C[are there better alternatives to black h4 
(I'm trying to kill his group)

<SC>:
Black can't kill all of White's stones here.  Black can only kill two of
the four marked white stones.  White gets to chose which stones to sacrifice.
 Either way, White gets to capture 3 Black stones next to the white stones
he chooses to save.];W[iq]TR[jq][kq][kp]SQ[fp][gp]C[<SC>: White
has chosen to sacrifice the two marked White stones and capture the three
marked Black stones.];B[gq];W[jr]C[<SC>: White captures 3 stones in gote.]
;B[kr]TR[kp][kq][kr][jq]SQ[ed][cj][dj][pf]C[<SC>:
This is bad.  It won't save the marked Black stones.  Just take Sente and
play elsewhere.  The squares are all good choices.];W[is]SQ[lr]
C[<SC>: White should just Atari at  m2.];B[lr];W[mr];B[ms];W[mq]
;B[nr];W[ks]C[<SC>: At least White ends in Gote.];B[ck]SQ[dj]
[cj]C[<SC>: This is a bit close to White.  I like C10 or D10 better.]
;W[bn];B[dl]SQ[dh]C[perhaps too early?

<SC>:
Assuming that White responds at d7, this move just forces White to strengthen
his position.  It doesn't make any territory for Black.  So, this move does
more for White than for Black. Playing around d12 is better.]
;W[ch]SQ[ck][dl][di][ej]C[<SC>:
The marked Black stones now have no base on the side for eyes and will have
to flee into the center or die.  E10 and D11 are both acceptable ways to
run.];B[ed]SQ[ck][dl]C[<SC>: This defends the corner but sacrifices
the two marked stones. At the end of the game, white wins by about the same
amount of territory as these two stones end up representing.  So, abandoning
these stones ends up making most of the score difference in the game.]
;W[de];B[dd];W[eh]
(;B[ee]SQ[cf][fk]C[<SC>:
F9 is a good option for the left side stones to run out into the middle.
 If you really want to give up on these stones and focus on the corner, then
I think it is better to attack the White stone's base on the left side. 
See Both variations.];W[ce];B[ef];W[gh];B[fg]TR[ce][de]SQ[dg]
C[<SC>: D13 is a better peep since it also encloses the two marked white stones.]
;W[fh];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg]TR[ce][de]SQ[cg]C[<SC>:
Bad.  This makes two empty triangles.  Playing instead at C13 kills the two
marked White stones and makes some side territory.];W[cg];B[gg]
;W[fm];B[cl]SQ[if]C[<SC>:
These stones are a lost cause.  Don't waste any more moves here.  J14 is
worth a lot of points.];W[bl];B[dm];W[dn];B[bm];W[bo];B[bk]
;W[cm];B[al]C[<SC>:
This group now has one eye, but making a second will be nearly impossible.]
;W[ai]C[<SC>: bad];B[hh];W[hi];B[ih];W[gm];B[hr]C[<SC>: Good, this group needs a second eye.]
;W[ls];B[hs];W[ek];B[ii]SQ[kh]C[<SC>:
This is the wrong direction to move.  Jump towards L12 instead.  Enlarge
the area you have around h15.];W[hj];B[ij]SQ[jf][lh]C[<SC>: Black
is building a central wall that faces strong white stones on the right side.
 This means that there will not be much territory at all made in the center
with this wall.  Meanwhile, white is solidly securing territory on the left
side.  This not a good exchange for Black.  Play around k14 to secure territory.
M12 is better to reduce white.];W[hk];B[ik];W[ke]C[<SC>: Now white plays to reduce Black's top territory.]
;B[ie];W[im];B[hl];W[gl];B[jl]C[
I misclicked here, should have been j8.];W[il];B[jk];W[lm];B[jm]
;W[lj]SQ[ii][ij][ik][jk][jl][jm]C[<SC>:
Black has spent several moves building this large wall. Now, one move by
white eliminates almost all of the potential for Black to make territory
while mapping out a large potential territory for White.  The marked Black
stones do almost nothing for Black's final score.  At the end of the game
this whole area is worth only 2 points for black.  Playing 6 stones to get
two points is not efficient.]
(;B[kc]C[<SC>: At this point White
is ahead by about 40 points.  No small, passive moves will make up that many
points.  It time for a desperate invasion by Black.  See variation.]
;W[mb];B[ob];W[ld];B[pf]C[<SC>: Good, you need to reduce white.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[mg];B[og];W[ph];B[oh]C[<SC>:
Here, Black is reducing White's potential territory, so this chain of stones
serves a better purpose than the center ones.];W[oi];B[nh];W[mh]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[mj]SQ[mb][mc][nc][ld][ke][ne][mg][mh]C[<SC>:
This is bad for White.  Black is threatening to cut off all of the marked
White stones and force them to make life in the center.];B[li]
;W[kg]
(;B[nf]C[<SC>:
Black needs to play inside this group to destroy eye space. Black needs to
play stones to make one of the dead shapes.  Then when white captures them,
only one eye will be left.  See variation.];W[mf];B[lc];W[ig]
;B[hg];W[if];B[hf];W[je];B[jd];W[oe];B[pe];W[od];B[jg];W[jf]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[kd];B[lb];W[ma];B[na];W[ja]C[<SC>: Bad]
;B[la];W[jb]C[<SC>: Also bad,  White needs to connect inside around n16.]
;B[jc]SQ[md]C[<SC>: Just cut at n16];W[ci]C[<SC>: Fortunately for Black, white wastes a move here.]
;B[md];W[me];B[nd];W[lf]C[<SC>: White finally has two eyes]
;B[lh]C[<SC>:
This move could be saved for a ko threat later.  It only reduces white's
score by 1 point, so other moves are worth more.];W[lg];B[be]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[hb];B[ib];W[ia];B[fb]C[<SC>:
Good, the keeps white out of the corner and goes a long way towards containing
him.];W[gb];B[fc];W[he];B[id];W[fa];B[ea];W[ga];B[eb];W[gd]
C[White has
one false eye and no room to make even one real eye. None of Black's groups
can be cut off by these invaders.  So, Black can ignore this move a take
sente.];B[ge];W[rd]C[<SC>: White gets Sente instead.];B[rc]
;W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[qg]SQ[bg][np][so][er][kj]C[<SC>:
This cut can't accomplish anything.  At best, it makes a decent ko threat
in case a ko arises later.  All of the moves marked with squares are Sente
moves worth more than this move.];W[qh];B[qc]C[<SC>: This is unnecessary.  Play T17 instead.]
;W[rg]C[<SC>: This is also unnecessary, so Black keeps Sente.]

;B[kj]C[<SC>: connect at L8];W[kl];B[ns];W[np];B[el]SQ[ek]C[Is there any hope for life for the black group (e8)?

<SC>:
No, not unless white makes an error.  In a game against a 26k opponent, it
could be worth trying however.  As long as White responds to each of your
moves, it won't change the final score.  If Black could surround the marked
white stone it would make a second eye.];W[an];B[fl]SQ[am]C[<SC>: If White plays at a7 before Black does, then Black loses the one eye he already has.]

at S1 due to a shortage of liberties.];W[qs];B[ir]SQ[qs][qr]
[rr][sr]C[<SC>:
No, Black needs to Atari the four marked stones in the lower right corner.
 See variation starting next move.]
(;W[js]C[See variation.];B[gr]C[<SC>:
This is unnecessary and reduces Black's score by one point. If White Ataris
at either G1 or G2 Black just captures on the other space and makes an eye.]
;W[do]TR[ej][fj][gj]SQ[bi]C[<SC>:
Unnecessary.  The large right side white group has one eye at B11.  It also
has a large eye around the three marked black stones.  The lower left corner
stones are also alive.];SQ[cl][lf]C[<SC>: Either saving
the group around c8 or killing the group around M14 would have made this
an even game.  Also, at least one of you should have noticed that whoevers
plays atari in the lower right corner first captures the whole corner.

<SC>:
Black got behind in the opening and early middle game. Hopefully you realized
how behind you were.  If not, then practice estimating the score of games
in progress.  It is easiest to do this with games someone else is playing
at first.  Then move on to counting your own games.  Assuming Black know
he was behind, he should have played more aggressive and even desperate moves
to try to catch up.];TB[aa][ab][ac][ad][ae][af][ba][bb][bc]
