C[derhannes [13k\]: hello


Hi Reviewer,

This is my first game I have submitted for a review. Normally my games are more peaceful - this is one of the first that it felt like there was a constant battle going on. My question is whether I played the "right" moves that won the various battles or if my opponent played poor moves that allowed me to win. I'm hoping someone with a keener eye can see some variations that may have been better for me or my opponent.

Many Thanks!

Reading isn't the strongest part of my game either, but I'll do my best...

After finishing the review, my basic comment is that both cases are true; you played well and your opponent made some mistakes that you capitalized on successfully.  I think you need to be aware of the overall situation a bit more, and focus on simplifiying and solidifying a lead when you recognize that you have one.  If you can, read up a bit on reducing moves; you don't always have to invade and face an enormous single battle that determines the game.  There's a rather old Ishi Press book called "Reducing Territorial Frameworks" that helped me a lot.

Good luck in your future games!

RickMott];B[pc]C[Ironyak1 [13k\]: hi];W[dp];B[qp];W[cd]C[RickMott: When your opponent  plays two 3-4's, indicating a high probability of wanting a territorial game, I think it is better to play two 4-4's in response and aim for influence.]
;B[oq];W[qe];B[qg];W[oe];B[qj]C[Used to joseki here at O16/17 - time to attack it seemed.]
;W[nc]C[RickMott: This seems like a fine idea.  Even if Black lives in the corner, you will get good strength outside.]
;B[od]
(;W[nd]C[RickMott: But I wouldn't follow up here.  Your two stones are at risk of being cut, and then it will get complicated.  I would be tempted to play Q16 instead.  See variation.]

(;B[ne]C[RickMott: This is a thank-you move.  Black should cut at Q15.]
;W[nf]C[Not sure about this one

RickMott: Why make it complicated?  Just atari at Q16 immediately and then make a tiger's mouth at R17.

This way black can play Q15 atari and connect...];B[me]C[RickMott: But he doesn't do that either  Both of you are seeking maximum complexity here.]
;W[pd]C[RickMott: AHA!  found it!  good move...];B[oc];W[qc]
;B[nb]
(;W[mc]C[Empty triangle seemed only choice

RickMott: Not necessarily.  You can sacrifice at P18 atari.  See variation.]
;B[dn]C[He went for a ladder breaker - As it didn't effect the P16 battle I let it go - should I have?]

(;W[fp]C[RickMott: No, I think R18 (or N18) was necessary for black.  You can punish him by playing there.  See variation.  It took a long time to figure out, but I think black is busted.]
;B[of];W[pe]C[Now it's a lot trickier for you.  You have to worry about living in the corner or breaking out.  I like to make the other guy worry instead... :)]
;B[ng]
(;W[pb]C[Ok, this still works.  I think a straight descent at R18 may be simpler, though.  It's sente, because you threaten to capture at P18 next.  So you'll kill him for sure.  This is harder.]
;B[lc]C[RickMott: Black chooses the outside.  Ok, fine.];W[mb]
;B[md]C[RickMott: No, this is wrong, black should descend at M18 to take a liberty.]
;W[ld]C[RIckMott: Yep, and that's why.  Good move!];B[le];W[kd]
;B[ke];W[jd]C[RickMott: Ok, you're getting 4th line territory, he's getting a big potential in the lower right.  But his moyo is going to be hard to convert to territory. I think you are coming out ahead here.]
;B[ed]C[RickMott: Good idea for Black to  limit your top territory.  The other obvious move is a big extension on the bottom.]
;W[gc]C[RickMott: This is very tempting, because it makes sure of capturing M17, but it's not very big.  The bottom is bigger, I think.  Especially because your two stones in the lower left are on the 4th line and open on the outside.]
;B[cc]C[RickMott: Not the best for Black, I think.  He has already reduced your top, he doesn't need to fight here.  He needs to make a big moyo to try and compensate for the loss at the top.]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[ce];B[cb];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[dc];W[ge]C[Too far?

RickMott: No, this is fine, black gets very little and his group does not have eyes.  You want to make him run.]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[fd];W[hc];B[he]C[RickMott: This seems risky.  Black should be worried about getting out.]
;W[gf];B[ef];W[dg]C[Decided to build left side and sacrifice g15 if need be

RickMott This is fine, good strategy.   Don't be too quick to sacrifice your cutting stones, though.  They are important to keep black's upper left group on the run.]
;B[fg]
(;W[eg]C[RickMott: I think extending from your weaker stones at G13 is better.  You threaten to catch H15 in a net.  See variation]
;B[ff]
(;W[dk]C[RickMott: This can't be bad, putting pressure on the lone black stone and staking out the left side.  I'm a little reluctant to give up the G15 cutting stones so easily though.  See variation.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[hg]C[RIckMott: Now black has captured you and his upper-left group lives.  That's a big loss for you.  I would have been strongly tempted to play here myself instead of poking up at K15.]

(;W[kf]C[RIckMott: And going striaight up at K14 is a much stronger follow-up.  That breaks the ladder and threatens to save your 2 stones.  You get one or the other.   See variation.]
;B[mf];W[if];B[hf]C[I decided to put pressure on d6 although I think this may have been a good time to invade right

RickMott: I agree, but you should reduce, not invade.  You have enough territory that you don't want complications.  If you reduce by extending from your bottom stones, D6 will get weaker naturally as your bottom group gets stronger.

When you want to attack something, it's usually better to strengthen yourself in sente elsewhere first if you can.  Otherwise it's like boxing while standing on one foot.]

;W[iq]C[Trying to sacrifice altitude for speed? OK choice or hold the 4th line?

RickMott: I think the real problem is that you can't go as far as you want because you started the fight around black's lower right group, and you don't have it enclosed.  Black should just extend to M3 and be delighted.  His lower right moyo may get big enough to give him a fighting chance.]
;B[hp]C[RickMott: Black gets in a forcing move first.];W[hq]
;B[jp]C[RickMott: This is not the right idea.  Black should block on the 3rd line at M3.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[gp];B[ho];W[jo];B[kp];W[jn]C[RickMott: This is a very complicated line of play.  Both of you have weaknesses; I think if Black just breaks out with H8 now he will have the advantage.  Your two brave stones at K5-6 will be in the middle of Black strength.  Black to the right of them, black to the left of them...]

(;B[ln]C[Here's where the invasion battle begins - not sure if I got lucky or he just couldn't kill - ideas and alternatives are most welcome.

RickMott: It's counterintuitive, but the rule of thumb is to drive the opponent toward your strength.  He is just trying to protect his moyo on the right.  He should have played H8 to keep you separated and protect his own weakness.  There are a zillion possibilities, but see a few of them in variations.]
;W[qm]C[RickMott: Black should ignore this stone.  Where is it going to go?  How will it make eyes?  H8 now.]
;B[rn]C[RickMott: I don't like this.  If black is going to play here, he should cap on top.

You should try to seal black in with J8.];W[om];B[ml];W[pk]

Maybe O5 as attack on Q6?

(;W[rm];B[so]C[RickMott: This move doesn't get you an eye, so better to save it for a ko threat and try elsewhere.  See variation two moves ago.]
;W[on];B[po];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl]C[RickMott: Ok, there's one eye.  But you need two.]
;B[pj]C[Felt like I should Protect my potential eye - Yes? Run?

RickMott: I think, if black makes no mistakes, your group cannot live.  I would drop it and try J8 to attack the black group on the left.]

(;W[ok];B[mn];W[ni];B[mi];W[mh]C[Much of what follows is mostly luck - I wish I could say I planned the attack - mostly I was just trying to get to the center.]

(;B[mj]C[RickMott: you're right.  Black should push in at Q10 and you are cut.  See variation.]
;W[oi]C[RickMott: Good move!   Takes advantage of black's mistake.

See variation to find out if Black had an effective response.]
