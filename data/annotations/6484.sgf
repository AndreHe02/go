C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing this game!

 I hope you can give me some general advices about the direction of play and some tactical & strategical improvements.

 Greetings, Nikolai];B[pd];W[do];B[qp];W[dd];B[dq]C[is this move common? which follow-ups? or what would be better?

This is a normal move in this corner situation, I will show you some standart joseki.
But I can'T tell wether this is good or bad here for sure, because I haven't seen this opening before.
I think this is quite even, if both play correctly, but I am far from professional judging.

The other move would be san-san to take the corner, but is a bad idea here immo.]

(;B[fq]C[all right?];W[di];B[fc];W[ec]TR[jd]C[This move is bad as long as white does not have a stone around K16]
;B[fd]
(;W[cf];B[jc];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[pn]C[is this a proper joseki?

Usually you see Q6 beeing played on R6, but it doesn't make as much of a difference, except for black getting some weakness here when he plays Q6]
;W[jp]SQ[jq]C[Playing the low move seems more appropriate here, because black can grind in there really easily otherwise.]
;B[gp]C[what about that move? I though getting outside would be a good idea...

See my comment in two moves.]
(;W[fo]C[White should not have played here, sacrificing that stone doesn't seem like much of a loss.]
;B[hq]C[Still the right side is bigger];W[qf];B[qi]C[good

White should have not played the kakari but played on the right side instead.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oe];W[qc];B[qd]C[block the right side?

I would consider this neither right nor wrong side, the problem you got was the follow-up.]
;W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[You pay 2 moves while you give white a base, to fix the p16 weakness, which is much smaller than the 2 moves you gave away.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[rc];B[rd];W[lc];B[nn]C[should i better protect the upper left group? in order to prevent h17

No, you should not be too afraid of that move.
Developing and protecting the right side moyo is crucial.
You are in this situation due to the P17 mistake, which was the initial error.]
;W[hc];B[hd]
(;W[id];B[ic];W[gd]
(;B[he];W[gc];B[ge];W[fb]C[acceptable result for black?]
(;B[fi]C[for me this one seemed to be a splendid move!

I don't think so.
This move appears to be too high.
You should only reduce when you are ahead, but you are behind in this game quite obviously.

You have to consider the black stones on the upper side to be weak.
Which will damage your right side as well when whtie attacks in the proper way.]
;W[le]
(;B[lo]
(;W[kq]C[This move seems strange];B[lp];W[lq]C[to small?

No, this is satisfactory for white, because you could have given much more damage to white.]
;B[jn];W[je];B[mr];W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[jr]TR[jp][np][op][kq]
[lq][nq][nr][ns]C[So both of you consider this stones dead at this point?]
;W[lg];B[ng];W[hi];B[ie];W[jd];B[ig];W[li];B[ji];W[pi]C[You should not have tenukied on this move.]

(;B[ni];W[qj]C[any comments to the last moves`? ...i think i lost a lot of territory on the right because i failed to destroy the aji of r14]
;B[qh];W[rj];B[ph];W[qn]
(;B[qo]C[This move seems strange as well.
White will probably live there, but this is way too passive.
Make him fight, to live there.
He is inside YOUR territory.];W[rn];B[pm];W[ql];B[qm];W[rm]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[rk];W[rl];B[ri];W[sk];B[dj];W[cj]
(;B[ej];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[dh];W[ch];B[dg];W[ce]C[Move 100 no more comments from this points.
Your major mistakes happened trough the opening.
You should work on your basic understanding of the game.
Such as weak and strong groups.
All in all, you made few mistakes in the rest of the game.
At least thats my impression from looking at the rest quickly.]
