C[Thanks for advance in reviewing this.  I've added some comments along the way on parts I thought I could have done better.  If you could I would just like some basic things I could have done differently or point out things I did wrong.

Comments: Andre Bergholz (2K, marked with AB)];B[pd];W[cp];B[qp]
;W[dd];B[oq];W[eq];B[qj];W[dj];B[fc];W[id];B[cf];W[fe]C[AB: So far, this is a very good and even opening. This move is a little bizarre as it leaves weaknesses.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec];W[ch]LB[he:A]C[AB: Clearly a mistake by White, much too close to the wall. The one Black stone is uninteresting. It would habe been much better to close the wall on a big scale with something like 'A'.]
;B[kc]LB[jp:A]C[AB: Also not very good as the upper side is no longer very interesting. The lower side is most interesting now, K4 is the key point.]
;W[jq]C[AB: Good. White is probably slightly ahead now.];B[bp]
LB[eo:A][fk:B][fp:C][lq:D]C[I've seen this invasion sometimes in stronger level games and am starting to use it more.  It's probably not that good.  Would a reducing move such as D7 or J4 be better?

AB: B4 is not necessarily bad, but it is not an invasion! It is a more high level strategy, a test move to see how White responds (give White a difficult dicision now and then try to make White's answer look bad later). Maybe you should stick to more conventional strategies such as reducing for the moment, 'A', 'B', or 'C' all look reasonable to me. If you are patient and have confidence, a simple extension to 'D' may be good enough.]
;W[bq];B[bo]LB[cq:A][co:B]C[AB: Now the drama begins. You start to create a heavy group where you really don't want to have one, namely where White is super-strong. If you want to play locally, at least try something light like the crosscut or hane.]
;W[bl];B[co]C[AB: Tristesse. White gets all the territory for sure now and Black has no base whatsoever.]
;W[dp];B[dm]C[AB: Bad shape. But anyway, you're in big trouble now.]

(;W[dl]C[AB: It seems to me that this is the wrong direction (see variation).]
;B[fm]C[AB: Again very bad shape.]
(;W[mq]C[AB: A little bit of a coffee-break move. The focus is the weak Black group (see variation).]
;B[el]C[AB: Good!];W[dk];B[pm]C[AB: Not good, greedy. The weak group needs more help.]

(;W[jj]C[AB: A little optimistic. It's better to first ruin the shape of the Black group (see variation).]
;B[cm];W[cl]LB[bm:A]C[AB: Probably better at 'A'. Too easy now for Black.]
;B[bm];W[en];B[em];W[do];B[dn]LB[fj:A][ip:B]TR[jj]C[AB: Absolutely useless move. This move is not necessary for connection and does not give you two eyes locally (A6 would kill). A simple jump to 'A' would be much better as it also makes the marked White stone look a little funny. An alternative is the severe reduction of 'B'.]
;W[fn]LB[fj:A]C[AB: Pushing from behind - not good either. Again, closing in at F10 would be simple and better (despite the weaknesses aound G15).]
;B[gn];W[fp];B[go];W[gp];B[hm]TR[go][gp]C[AB: Very slow. Probably you should have stopped this sequence after the hane G6. Now that you protected H7, the exchange of the marked stones is funny (clearly good for White, as he gets to protect his territory for free).]
;W[nc]C[AB: Pretty severe actually.];B[oc]LB[pc:A][pf:B]C[This is probably the losing move.

AB: Well, there a have been many losing moves already :-). And there will be some more coming up, I'm sure. This one is not so bad. Protecting the corner is valuable, maybe 'A' or 'B' would be slightly better as they do not reinforce Black so much.]
;W[nd];B[qg]C[AB: Looks a little strange.];W[ib]
(;B[ke]C[AB: Ok, this fight is normally doable for Black. If you are really afraid there is the simple variation, that gives Black still a good result in sente.]
;W[nf];B[kg];W[if];B[gd]C[AB: Bad, reinforces White.];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[he];B[jb]LB[nh:A]C[AB: Crucial mistake! In a battle, you just have no time for a coffee-break. You have to get ahead of your opponent. Ok, at least it's sente maybe, but White could ignore here and try to make his own group save. Black 'A' instead will give more trouble to White than to Black.]
;W[jc];B[ka]LB[lb:A][nh:B]C[AB: Now this move is not sente anymore, and bad shape too. White should just peep 'A' and then run 'B'.]
;W[lb];B[jd];W[ic];B[lc]C[AB: You need to connect.];W[kb];B[mb]
;W[ja];B[nb];W[mc];B[nh]C[Should I have kept running away with M11 instead of trying to fight with this move?

AB: Now things get difficult. The Black group is "small" now and will have not many liberties in a fight. I think O12 is good as it is overall good direction.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[pf];B[qf];W[pe]C[AB: Good play by White here.]
;B[qe];W[mg];B[mh]LB[ki:A]C[AB: This seems to be a mistake. It can be foreseen that Black will be cut off. Just running with 'A' is better.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[lf]LB[jg:A]C[AB: Maybe 'A' gives you more options.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ih]C[AB: White should take the ko at least once.]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[oh];W[ld];B[kd];W[me];B[le];W[md];B[oe];W[ne]
;B[og];W[of];B[pg];W[kf];B[fd]C[This was about all I could find for threats.  This is where I started to fall behind.

AB: A little bit, but the game is not hopeless.];W[je];B[ee]
;W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[bd];W[be];B[ce];W[ee];B[bf];W[mm]C[AB: Good direction, but way too far out. There should be a chance for a good fight for Black.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[cg]LB[eh:A]C[AB: Bad! 'A' is the only move, White cannot cut.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[bh];B[eg];W[fh]
(;B[fg]C[AB: Not small, but the next White move is much bigger! You have to fight now (see variations)!]
;W[mo]C[AB: Now the game is difficult for Black.];B[fj];W[gk]
;B[fk];W[gl];B[gm];W[gi];B[gj];W[ik];B[an]C[AB: You see what happens when you neglect your weak groups. There is always a bill to be paid later on.]
;W[ap];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq];B[in];W[jp];B[io];W[po]C[AB: It's unclear whether this is good.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pp];B[pq]C[AB: Now the White shape is bad, so it is gote. Not really many points. Just P2 in the beginning would have been better, I think. Especially Q4 is definitely bad.]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[nk];B[oj]C[AB: Double hane is possible, I think.]
;W[no]C[AB: Necessary, but tiny.];B[ei]LB[nr:A]C[AB: O2 is very big.]
;W[bj];B[gh]C[AB: Looks big, but O2 is much bigger.];W[hi];B[ko]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[kn];B[km];W[ln];B[jl];W[il];B[im]C[AB: Unnecessary, a wasted move.]
;W[nq];B[op]C[AB: I have the impression you react too much to the moves of your opponent here. Then you will only get the second best move in every area. How can you win? Something like G18 is interesting, too.]
;W[oo]C[AB: Also unnecessary, saves one point.];B[np]C[AB: This move is bad technique, because it takes away your own liberties. There may be problems around R3 later on. That is not worth the trouble. You will get this one point later anyway, as White will not anytime soon protect O4 (too small).]
;W[mp];B[nj]
(;W[nr]C[AB: Hane is better in this case, I think (variation).]
;B[or];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[os]TR[mp][np]C[AB: Without the exchange of the marked stones, there is no atari here...]

[sr][qs][rs][ss]C[And that was the game.  I think I made up some ground in the endgame just not enough to win.  Thanks again for the review.

AB: Ok, that was not a bad game at all. Your biggest problem was that you put yourself into trouble with the invasion on the left side. The fight on the upper side was a bit of bad luck and because of the ko, it was not so decisive. There were some mistakes by White that you didn't manage to take advantage of. Sometimes you need to be patient and wait for the opportunity. For that, it is important that all our groups are as safe as possible, only then can you go all out when the moment comes. You needed to worry about the group on the left for a long time, that was a big burden. Then there are some things about technique  you should look into. It is easy to avoid bad exchanges once you can spot them. Think about it that way: Both players put down one stone each. If  your opponent benefits from this pair of stones more than you do, you should not play there. Then shape. That's quite difficult. But think about eye shape for all your groups. If you have a long string of stones floating around, there is something wrong. If you have any more questions don't hesitate to email me at Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com.]
