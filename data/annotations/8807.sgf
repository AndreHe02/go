OT[5x30 byo-yomi]

C[Hello,

thanks for your time!

In this game I'm playing white. Some background: I've recently started to play slower games (20min + 5*30sec byo-yomi, instead of 5min or 10min + 5*30 sec byo-yomi) and fewer games (at most 1-2 per day). Slower games (and doing lots of tsumego) seem to have improved my winning percentage (maybe I'm just annoying my opponents by keeping them waiting while I try to read things out :-) ).

This is a 20min + 5*30sec game. My opponent resigned in the end game, but not sure why (he didn't stay to explain). He was a little behind, but the game was close. I used up most of my time by the time yose started, and I got distracted in the middle game (not because of any external factor, just couldn't keep myself focused enough).

I've added some comments (kind of a mini self-review), marked with 'MB:', so you can get a better idea what I was thinking about (and hopefully find the errors in my judgment).

Thanks again!

Hello, Miron!

This is Bernd from Germany, HonFu in the GTL and in other go places.

Around your level many (not all) players switch to a new rhythm of less, but more serious games. I think it's a very good idea; and the same goes for your tsumego practice.

So let's see what we've got here!];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[qk]
;W[jq]C[MB: I wanted to prevent black from making large frameworks. I also considered O3. Other suggestions?

Hon: An approach move against the lower left looks natural.]
(;B[mq];W[ep]
(;B[eq]C[MB: I think black is helping me here a little. Maybe he should have played between my stones? My feeling is that my last move was an overplay, but he helped me out.

Hon: Yes, this makes your moves joseki.];W[fq];B[dq];W[fp];B[cn]
(;W[dj]C[MB: I get sente because I already had K3 in place. I'm trying to build a large framework around D16 and start a fight there.

Hon: You choose the wrong direction here. 

D10 goes in the direction of the strong and settled black group in the lower left. This has no effect; it is hard for you to make points here; and there even is some danger that Black invades behind the stone. (We will see all of this in the game.)]
;B[od];W[md]C[MB: Didn't really know what to play here. This seemed like helping with the D16 framework.

Hon: I am not very good at joseki science. A pincer looks okay, but I might have chosen a wider pincer, probably M16. It's harder to start a counter attack against the stone then, and the upper side is not so wide open.]
;B[pc]C[MB: Is this joseki? It seems a little dubious. I'm kind of glad to play R17.

Hon: I also would be happy to get R17. Kogo's dictionary doesn't have the move. Probably for a good reason. :-)]
;W[qc];B[pf]
(;W[rf];B[qg]
(;W[nf]C[MB: Again, I'm not really sure what I'm doing (other than not giving black a lot of territory and trying to build something around D16). N14 seemed like a good play, but I also wanted to threaten to cut black. Maybe I'm after too much.

Hon: Or you are after not enough. After you have defended the corner, you might cut him directly.]
;B[of];W[mg]C[MB: Any other suggestions here? O13 seems OK too, I wanted a better connection.

Hon: If you want to be safely connected it's probably better to use the one-point jump in the first place instead of having to add one more move. This shape looks flawed leaving a point like M14 to aim at.]
;B[fc]C[MB: Wish I could have played one more stone on the upper side :-)

Hon: Then maybe K16 was your move! ;-)];W[hc]C[Hon: Good.]
(;B[fe]C[Hon: This looks like a mistake. White has support on both sides, so black should hurry and get a base.

The attack on this group will be the theme of this match.]
(;W[ec]C[MB: I'm trying to attack white.

Hon: This is the normal move if F6 is not yet there. Here it looks a bit too much.]
;B[gc];W[df];B[hb]C[Hon: Now you have rather given him a reason to weaken your pincer stone. Attacking profitably already looks hard.]
;W[ib]C[MB: The plan is to separate black's stones if black cuts at J17. See var.]
(;B[hd]C[Hon: Black does not fall into that trap though.];W[ic]
;B[id];W[kc]C[Hon: Now you probably saw that black is not really under much pressure. Contact is often counter-productive if you want to attack. Contact makes both sides strong.]
;B[ke]C[Hon: This is too much.];W[pd]C[MB: I'm trying to get black to help me connect my stones...]
;B[ne];W[me];B[lf];W[mf]C[MB: ... and he obliges.

Hon: Very helpful of him. ;-)

N13 looks a bit funny now though.];B[oc]
(;W[ig]C[MB: I'm looking to cut at K16.

Hon: You are looking too much. The cut is there, so cut!

This stone has no relation to your other stones and can easily suffer a counter-attack.]
(;B[fg]
(;W[jd]
(;B[je];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[hf];W[gd];B[fd]
(;W[jf];B[ge];W[hg];B[gf];W[kg];B[dh]C[MB: I think this result is OK for white. I'm trying to attack the black group around F15 or get some territory on the left side.

Hon: This point here is one you would have liked yourself. I don't like this so much for white. D10 seems to cry out now.]
;W[ch]C[Hon: This move is usually bad.];B[ci];W[di];B[cg];W[eh]
C[Hon: You may be getting some kind of connection, but you give him a ponnuki-shape in return which is considered as too much.]
;B[bh];W[eg];B[gh]C[Hon: Black looks a bit busy, but I like this for him. 

Your shapes are too thin to attack him hard. He is out AND he's standing right in your largest territory with his ponnuki.]
(;W[fh]C[MB: this looks like a mistake. I'm almost giving black one eye. G13 was probably better.

Hon: G13 just takes your own liberties and achieves nothing. These kind of moves you should save for a moment where they hurt!]
;B[gg];W[hk]C[Hon: You've been playing those vague far-away nets quite often. If possible you should look for moves which are easy to read out and solve the matter directly.

And if you can't find such a move, stop the attack for now. There might be a chance later.]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[fk];B[ii];W[hj];B[hi]
(;W[cl]C[MB: I'm trying to make sure the ladder in the variation works....]
(;B[bk]
(;W[bl];B[be]
(;W[ce]C[Hon: You are helping him right into your territory.]
;B[bd]
(;W[lj];B[li];W[mj];B[jk]C[Hon: Like this he just runs into your influence. You don't get anything for your attack - unless you kill him.]
;W[jl]C[MB: this is definitely an overplay. I lost my concentration for a few moves here and then tried hard to fix things.

Hon: I think you attacked too hard in the first place. Normally when you attack too hard, you end up being forced to keep up the hopeless attack and lose ground in the process.

But anyway, I think this move is not bad at all! You again start to build a wall towards your bottom group, aiming at making points in the center.

The purpose of an attack is that you get something from it. And here you are doing just that.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[lk]C[Hon: But now its probably time to talk peace. Your shapes are not strong enough here anyway to confine him for the moment.]
(;W[nl]C[Hon: I can understand the feeling though.];B[ll];W[kn]

(;W[pl]
(;B[nj];W[oi]C[Hon: This stone is not so important, since you will not kill black. Rather take R8!]
(;B[qj]C[MB: not sure why black didn't play R8.

Hon: Maybe he was afraid of you. :-) You attacked him quite fiercely.]
;W[ql];B[ck];W[dk];B[en];W[do]C[MB: This is dumb. Should have been at D7.]
;B[dn];W[dl];B[bn];W[rg];B[rh];W[og];B[ph];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro]
;B[qn];W[rl]C[MB: I was already having problems with the time.

Hon: Yeah, as soon as you really start to think, the time somehow is never enough. It's good - when you're ready for it play even slower and read more!]

;W[bq];B[br];W[ds]C[MB: This is where black resigned. Not sure why :-) - it seems I can't do anything in the corner.

Hon: Professional resignation - you lead by a few points and he sees no way to catch up.

Or he just lost heart. ;-)

I like how you persist with your attack. 

You have a tendency, though, to play attacking moves that are just a bit far off or somewhat vague. A little too much aiming and too little shooting. When there is a cut, then cut. When there is a net, then net him. And when he's alive - stop the assault and take the points (Upper left)! In general you should see to it that you get something for your attack. For a while it looked like you lost aim, just pushing the group here and there, but then you reclaimed the right direction and made something of the bottom.

Oh yeah, and think about that direction mistake in the fuseki - not approaching strong stones is a very important principle!

I hope this review was of some help for you. Good luck for your future games!

(;AW[cf][dp]AB[fc][kc][qd][pq]AE[qk][cp][pp][jq]C[Hon: Probably you've seen the Mini-Chinese formation at the top. 

Although the moyo might grow, professional players mostly play something like Q5 now and aim at a later reduction of that framework. So I assume the same should be okay against your opponent's formation.

Approaching a 3-4-stone is super big!]))
