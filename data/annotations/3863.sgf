C[Ken: Thank you reviewed my game. You are a helpful person.

Please point out my mistakes which I cannot discover by myself.

I am Black in this game.

(;B[cj]LB[ci:A]C[Ken: Should I put the splitting move at A is better?

Niklaus: The white group below is very thick (hard to attack -> strong in battle). Therefore it is a good idea not to get too close. So I indeed would prefer A (see variation).]

(;W[dk];B[ck];W[dl]C[Niklaus: Looks like white is trying too hard to kill black. He should be a little more patient and build up a strong position while attacking black. 

1 weak group usually survives, but if you wait until there are 2 or 3 of them, then the chances of killing one are much better.]

or just enter 33 is good? But I tried after the game and can not alive when entering A at this time. right?

Niklaus: A can live. See variation];W[gc];B[lc]C[Niklaus: W's response here is a bit too nice, I think. He should rather play around o17 himself. Especially as the corner is still not entirely safe from invasion at 3-3.]

[aq][eq][gq][hq]SQ[ej][fj][dk][fk][cl][dl][fl]C[Niklaus: This is a very bad exchange for white. See the previous variation for how to play around there. However, I would consider not answering here. (especially as there is no new threat. you accepted to trade off that weakness for the big move at r10)

White has three groups here which are all not very strong (the circled one as a result of r10). Making three weak groups alive is difficult, so you should think about how to attack them most effectively here.]
;W[nd];B[od]LB[ne:A]C[Ken: Should I join or atari at A ?

Niklaus: I would play like this too. A is possible too, but gives away about 10 points. (assuming you can capture o16)]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf]C[Niklaus: This is a bad strategy by white. He just adds more weak groups to his game while giving black the chance to strengthen himself even more.]

Niklaus: B125 is indeed not very good, as white is alive anyway. B and C seem a little better than A, as they leave behind less weaknesses (for example in another ko fight)]

(;B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[kp];B[mp];W[lp];B[np];W[lm]LB[in:A]C[Ken: I think the three white stones are still not stable. Does any method to attack them together such I can put some move around A?

Niklaus: It's getting more difficult now, as white has made more or less good shape for his O6 group. Besides, because of M7 the ladder resulting from the cut at g4 works for W now.]

(;B[jj]C[Niklaus: Looks like you missed the real threat of J12. you should capture the two stones instead. The group on the left side can still live or connect later.]
;W[lf];B[li];W[kf]C[Ken: Black is cut off by White, what can Black do?

Niklaus: A does not work either.];W[ko];B[fn];W[in];B[go]C[Ken: Now I think Black is so bad that allow 3 unstable groups of white stones easily alive.

What's wrong of black.

Niklaus: Right!!! 

Your opening was much better than you opponent's, but: you missed the right time for attacking those 3 groups. You only started to think about attacking after the group on the right has become strong. 
Finding the right time is not always easy. If you attack too early, as white did on the right, the opponent can easily defend. 

I won't comment on the endgame, apart from that life & death situation in the lower right, before which you still would have won the game...

Hope my review was helpful to you.  Bear in mind, however, that I am a kyu player as well, and that my analysis may be flawed. If you have any more questions, feel free to email me.]
