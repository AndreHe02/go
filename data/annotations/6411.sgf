C[30 mins game
Me (Black) vs rehlich(White)

D: Hello, I will write my comments with letter 'D' before them.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dq];W[dd];B[co];W[jq];B[pj]C[ Right side for fuseki?

D: Yes, Q10 or R10 looks very well.];W[gq];B[cf]C[D: I would play R10 instead of C14.]
;W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]
;W[ge];B[jd]C[D: G17 is standard answer to G15 but anyway I still think that R6 should be played before any other.]
;W[hc]C[ is the cut of w overplay? what could be the response?

D: Yes, the cutting at H16 would be overplay since there is a weakness at E17/E18. I like peaceble and safe F18 in such shapes, and then the cutting at H19 is possible or an opponent has to add any gote protecting move.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[cj]C[D: Too close to influence, if you don't like R6 and want play on the left side then C8 should be enough.]
;W[cl];B[dh];W[cg];B[ej]C[D: Nice.];W[el];B[dg];W[df];B[ci]
;W[fi];B[fk];W[ei];B[fl];W[en];B[dk]C[D: I don't like this move because cutting at D8 would only help black to make a shape that weakens your shimari. I would play F7 to prevent white from making good shape after played at the same point.]
;W[dl];B[fg];W[gi];B[hg];W[ef];B[fh];W[hj];B[hl];W[jj]C[I tried to chase the group but in this move i was a bit confused about what to do.

D: I would chase this group looking for further attack on the E8 group.]
;B[jk]C[D: I don't like this contact move, just to jump at K8 would be better.]
;W[ik];B[il];W[kk];B[jl];W[kj];B[ii];W[ij];B[hi];W[gk];B[fj]
C[D: Protection the G8 is more important. The last moves you were playing little too aggessive, you try to catch the white group very quckly and directly.]
;W[gj];B[bh]C[D: I would prefer F7 know, tjos move either threatens the E8 group and secure the cutting at G8.]
;W[bf];B[kl]C[D: Still too aggresively, you shouldn't leave so many weakness around, I mean the cutting point at G8, D11 and G12.]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[fm];B[di];W[gn];B[ll];W[hm];B[pm];W[nl];B[mk]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[bg];B[qo]C[D: Bad move, O4 or O3 looks much better but I think the biggest one would be O10 because makes the N9 group very safe and moreover starts to build a moyo in the upper right area.]
;W[po]C[D: I think black is little lucky here, white's R4 would be better answer.]
;B[qp];W[nj];B[mh]C[D: Move at N11 would be more solid.];W[gh]
;B[gg];W[if];B[jh];W[li]TR[jk][hl][il][jl][kl][ll]SQ[po][pp]
C[instead of exchanging,  In this point i decided to exchange those groups. was that good?]
;B[lh]C[ D: Necessary move or white might kill the black D12 group playing L13, but unfortunately M8 group is almost dead now. It is result that you were playing too aggressivle and allowed your opponent to divide your weak group.]
;W[mi];B[nn]C[D: OK, give your group up taking another one in return is good strategy, much better then trying to save M8 playing N7.]

D: Yes, you will do few big mistakes in the endgame. At the moment you are few points ahead.
