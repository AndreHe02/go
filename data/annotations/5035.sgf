C[Chris: Thank you for looking at this game.

DF: white made some slow moves in the opening, but black played slow moves in the middle game, and failed to effectively attack the weak white group in the upper right.  White lost points on the left with a failed invasion, but found a really good move in the lower right in the endgame to win the game.]

;B[cj];W[ch]LB[cf:C][cj:11][qe:B][pe:A]C[This move is a little slow.  Because 11 is low, this move is not a threat against the black group.  If black plays at C his position on the left side is low, so it's not urgent for you to prevent it.

Playing at A or B is bigger.];B[ej];W[op]LB[fq:10][pe:A]C[Chris: Now I think playing at A would have been bigger since W10 is low.

DF: yes, A is much bigger.  Since your stone at 10 is low, there is little potential for development on the lower side.  Black has much more potential on the right, so it's important to play there first.]
;B[fc]LB[ch:12][ic:A]C[Chris: I was not sure how what to do here. I was thinking about a pincer around A. In the end I had a chance to reduce the terretory there very deeply, which made the game close again. It feels like W12 is in an awkward position, no matter what I choose.

DF:  It's not easy to find a good move here.  Your choice still leaves the corner open and strengthens black.  The pincer is not very good since black can take the corner, and your thickness won't be very effective.

I like D18 ot D14.  They leave black thinner, or low on the upper side.]

(;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[jd];W[qq]C[Chris: Here again I think approach thing top right would have been more urgent.

DF: yes.  the upper right is much bigger.];B[qi]C[Chris: I was suprised by this move, but I like it a lot.

DF: black is making a very large framework.];W[pp];B[qo];W[rq]
;B[pl];W[pe]C[Now when you come in you are much weaker than if you had played here earlier.]

(;B[nc]LB[nd:A]C[This black move is not severe enough.  Black is thinking just about the territory he can make with this move.  If he attacks white more stongly, he will get many moves to make the upper side big and secure.

A is better.];W[qc]

(;W[mg]LB[qi:A]C[Chris: I found it hard to make shape here. What is a good way to avoid becoming so heavy or make shape now?

DF: it's not easy.  A is in just the right spot to prevent you from extending on the right side.  I like O14, but whatever you do black will get several attacking mvoes before you can escape. It's easier if you don't let black get this kind of moyo.  Then you don't have to come in when there are so many black stones nearby.]
;B[nf];W[ne];B[oi]C[This move is slow.  It doesn't attack very strongly.]
;W[fb]C[Good.  Solidify your corner and reduce the upper side.  But it's dangerous to give black another move to attack your weak group.]
;B[gb];W[eb]
(;B[of]LB[og:A]C[A is better.];W[nd];B[mc];W[pg];B[mf];W[qh]
;B[ri];W[le];B[kd];W[lf];B[oh];W[kq];B[on]C[This move is very small.  It has no effect on white, and only adds about 2 points of black territory.]
;W[dk]C[DF: The game is very close, and you already have one weak group on the board.  Starting a fight now is dangerous, since it looks like you can win without it.]
;B[dj];W[bl]C[DF.  Nice looking shape.]
(;B[bm]LB[cl:A]C[DF: this looks like a mistake.  Black needs to stay connected at A.  Let white take a few points in gote, and get stronger toward the center.  Since white has an unsettled group in the upper left, gaining thickness should gain more territory in the center than black is giving up here.

If black gets separated it will be very difficult for him.]

(;W[bk]LB[el:B][bj:A]C[Chris: I missread this. Should have been A?

DF:  A gives black the option to stay connected, so if you want to separate black, you have to try this move.  It looks like it dosn't work, but it's not easy to refute it.

Since this move doesn't work, A or B is better locally.  B is interesting, sicne it reduces black, and expands your lower side.]
;B[bj]
(;W[dl]LB[el:A]C[DF: It looks like you can try to get out with a move at A instead. It's much harder to stop, and leads to a better result.]
;B[em]LB[bm:B][bj:A]C[A big loss for white.  Besides losing some stones, the black moves at A and B damage white's positions above and below.]

(;W[pf]LB[iq:A]C[Chris: With less chances to run I felt I need to strengthen this group now. Is now the right time, or should it have been done earlier?

DF: As black gets thicker you will need to strengthen eventually. You have reduced the center really well, so there is not much danger of black getting a large center any more.

I don't like this strengthening move since it doesn't increase your eye space or help you run away.  I would just connect in the center and run once.

It looks like you can take time to defend the bottom at A, since you have a forcing move in the center to help you run.]
