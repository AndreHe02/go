C[Hello,
I hope you find my review useful, and feel free to send me any questions about it to justforori@gmail.com

**
This was a very interesting and fun game for me, although I know I made many errors.  I feel I learned a lot from it, especially in the end-game, and would like to learn more!

I was playing black, and lost ...significantly.

My only specific notes occur at move 166 and move 225.  Of course, i would also appreciate your comments on the rest of the match.

Losing this game bumped me back down into the begninner class on igs.  It seemed like a good time to ask for advice.  This is my first request for analysis from a more experienced player, and I am looking forward to your comments.

C[Ok.  I had been watching the hole in the right side of my center position for a while.  I knew I needed to defend it.  I just never did.

This is where I feel things really got ugly.  Please help me learn from it!

Thanks!]

Left side was big during a lot of time and no side played it. And think about giving some stones, ask yourself if a stone is important before trying to save it.

I hope I've helped you a little, please, anything, just mail me!
I cheer you to continue improving! Bye Dave!])
