;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[jd];W[kp];B[pj];W[dj]LB[cn:a]C[The B7, W8 exchange leaves B with no convenient followup against the lower right corner.  If 7 and 8 were reverse B would have 'a'.]
;B[qn]LB[op:a][ql:b][pm:c]C[This just provokes Wa. which both strengthens W and threatens and invasion at 'b'. Bc, Wa is more reasonable as it starts to build a central moyo.]
;W[oo]LB[op:a]C[Should be at 'a'. This leaves a weakness whihc B can aim to exploit ...]
;B[on]C[... but B immediately forces W to cover his weakness,  This is a thank you move in the extreme.]
;W[no];B[ch]LB[cg:a][cf:b]C[I prefer 'a'. The upper right and lower left are symmetrical, but B11 gave W a better position in the lower right than B has in the upper left.  So B is already lost ground.  This over extension leave a potential invasion point at 'b']
;W[cj]LB[co:a]C[Too heavy.  This would be a nice move is W already had a stone around 'a']
;B[eh]C[
  saci 13k*: i think i'd better :)];W[nn]LB[fj:a]C[This is a nice locking move but it does solidify B's side. Given that there is so much room to invade at the bottom maybe this is not such a good idea.  I would play 'a'.]
;B[om];W[nm]LB[fj:a][dn:b][fp:c][ml:d]C[Overdoing it.  This make W6 look silly, so close to the wall. If W wants to expand the moyo 'a', 'b' and 'c' look better. Locally 'd' is better than 18.]
;B[fq]C[Ideal invasion.];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[iq]LB[kq:a][io:b]
[kr:c]C[This wil prbably be followed by Wa, Bb so there is a tempation to slide into 'c' in order to reduce the lower right.  How this works out would depend on the skills of the players.]
;W[jq]LB[kq:a][lq:b]C['a' is better.  this leaves 'b' for B to aim at in the future.]

(;B[ip]LB[hn:a]C[This looks heavy.  Look at the variation at 'a'.]
;W[pg]LB[nd:a][ng:b][nj:c][nc:d]C[This looks dangerous.  Ba, Wb, Bc leads nowhere for W.  I prefer a direct invasion at 'd']
;B[qe]LB[nd:a][qd:b][qc:c]C[Wrong direction.  Ba would help the moyo much more.  With the high approach it is hard for W to get into the corner so this move is not urgent.  After 'a', if W attaches at 'b' B is happy to take the corner with 'c']
;W[nc]LB[lc:a][jc:b][pb:c]C[This invites B to split the two stones. 'a' would be better as it has follow up moves at both 'b' and 'c'.]
;B[nd];W[pb]LB[md:a]C[funny looking move. W must play at 'a']
;B[oc];W[ob];B[qc]LB[mc:a]C[the corner is small. B can give it up easily in exchange for outside thickness.  This invites W to play at 'a' after which B has failed to seal W in.]
;W[qb]LB[mc:a]C[Must play at 'a' to get out.  If B responds at 'a' the outside thickness is too much.]
;B[mc];W[pc]LB[nb:a]C[this a a dame point.  Must connect at 'a'.  To let B capture w28 is tantamount to resigning.]
;B[nb];W[rc];B[qd]LB[rd:a]C[Ugly shape. B does better to play at 'a']
;W[rd];B[re];W[sb];B[nj]C[nice move.  maybe W shoud have play here instead of W40.  Giving B the  chance to kill the corne ris not as bad as it seems.  The corner is worth almost 30 pts but there is a difference of 2 moves if B kills so playing there is only worth 15 pts.  This B43 is worth more than 15 pts.]
;W[cc]LB[dc:a]C[W is behind and needs to try more than this, perhaps 'a'.]
;B[dc];W[cb]LB[bd:a][cd:b]C[This is dead if B plays 'a'.  Must be at 'b']
;B[db];W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[bh]C[nice play.  sente against the corner and threatening to undermine the left.]
;W[jh]LB[cd:a][bd:b][bb:c][fj:d][jj:e][ji:f][if:g][id:h][ii:i]
C[B can now kill the corner with Ba, Wb, Bc but for W to defend would invite B to play at 'd' and the game would be over.  this move is probably too deep as it allows Be.  Better to hold back to 'f'.  On the other hand, W is behind so maybe a full invasion is called for, something like 'g' with follow ups at 'h' or 'i'.  In either case, W52 seems like a half-measure.]
;B[cf]LB[jj:a]C[This doesn't do anything. Should be at 'a']
;W[bb]LB[cd:a]C[Strange shape. the simple play at 'a' is best.]
;B[jf]LB[jj:a]C[As mentioned previously, Ba is severe.];W[gr]
C[There is no time to attack these stones when there are two weak stones on the board at 26 and 52.  W has no chance of killing this group until his own stones are safe.]
;B[fr];W[ir];B[jr];W[kr];B[hr];W[is];B[gs];W[er]C[W really doesn't have time for this.  Now that B is virtually alive  he must take care of his own stones.  A gote move like this is worth only about 20 pts. and is too small at this stage.]
;B[co]LB[es:a][ak:b]C[Why is B invading?  Does he see the  W territory as bigger than it reallay is?  After B moves at 'a' and 'b' this territory is not much more than 20 pts. By invading B could turn it into much more.]
;W[do];B[cl];W[cn];B[bl];W[bj];B[dl]C[Funny looking but effective.]
;W[fm]LB[fj:a]C[Black has given W a chance by invading but W hands it right back.  A move at 'a' threatens a splitting attack against the left stones and the bottom group. Admittedly it does not have much chance of succeeding because W has too many weak stones, but the game is lost if B captures the group on the left so W has nothing to lose.]
;B[fl];W[el];B[ek];W[em];B[dk];W[fk];B[ej];W[gl]C[Game is now over.]
;B[gq]LB[in:a][hp:b]C[Why?  If B is worried about this group then 'a' protects is much better as it protects agsint the only dangerous play W has - 'b']
;W[gi];B[fi]LB[gg:a][gh:b]C[Must be at 'a'.  How will B answer if W plays 'b'?]
;W[gj]LB[hg:a]C[Meaningless. W needs muc more. 'a' at the very least.]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[gg]LB[hg:a]C[B can double hane at 'a'];W[if]
;B[ig];W[hg];B[hf];W[ie];B[jg];W[ih];B[he]LB[lg:a][hp:b][ho:c]
[go:d][gp:e][io:f]C[This is inside B's territory !  'a' is better.  B could also consider protecting against Wb, Bc, Wd, Be, Wf]
;W[kh]LB[mi:a]C[Strong shape, but not enough. 'a' looks more interesting.]
;B[ng];W[oi]LB[qj:a]C[W's best chance here is at 'a', although it would be tough to live.]
;B[ni]LB[oj:a]C['a' is better. If W pushes out at 99 B has the option of letting him escape and in exchange ruining W's chances in the middle.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[pk];B[pi];W[oh];B[qk];W[pl];B[ol]C[Nice sequence by B]
;W[nh];B[og];W[mh];B[ph];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[id];W[lf]C[Small.  There is more territory in the middle.]

;B[qh];W[nk]LB[hp:a]C[W's only chance it to take away the eye by playing 'a' and hope t o kill the group.  Now that he has all the thickness he might actually do it.]
