C[Hi

This is Wonodan from KGS, reviewing your game.

I will start my comments with W so there won't be any misunderstandings.

Feel free to contact me or ask me any questions you have by sending me e-mail lauri.vihavainen@gmail.com or messages for my account on KGS.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]C[would a pincer be better?

W: Yes. When you have a hoshi on the same side as the komoku, you usually play a pincer.]
(;W[gq]C[W: Now it's easy for black to settle his stone on the right side.]
(;B[fo]
(;W[od]C[is this the right move or should I have approach the lower right corner or try to attack the two stones (C5)? Didn't know what is the biggest point

C[W: You handled this situation very nicely.];B[jd]LB[fc:B]
[dl:A]C[W: After black's K16 here you have two choices.

A ladder breaker around A or blocking black's thickness at B.

When your opponent makes thickness like this, you want to defend the group closest to it.]
;W[qa]C[W: This is an endgame move.

In the opening you should not make endgame moves, as it won't affect the opening or middle-game.

When black plays at P18 your group doesn't have two eyes yet.]

W: This is a simple capturing race.

Both players have three liberties (see triangles and squares)

The one who moves first wins the capturing race.]

;W[lq];B[mq];W[kr]C[W: Living with this group was nice, but the problem is that you probably can not form a living group at the bottom left.

When fighting for your life like this, your other groups get in trouble while your opponent gets stronger.

As mentioned before, white could connect all groups safely by capturing at F10.]

;W[ge];B[dk];W[lg]C[this was the only thing I could think of on which black might react (I thought to resign here since the ko is huge) is there a better ko threat?]
;B[aj];W[nf]C[W: If white kills black on the left side, white gets 40 points.

Killing this top black group is also 40 points, so that's not bad either.]

You needed the move at C3 suggested earlier.

You can still win, the game is close.];W[cq];B[eq];W[er];B[cr]

C[W: You gave up too early, you had a huge territory at the top, and the top left black group definately isn't completely alive yet.

When you have a long game such as this, feel free to play fast moves.

But in situations that are important, that are about to decide the flow of the whole game, feel free to concentrate a little while, and you'll probably find a better move than the move you were going to play. : )

I hope this helps!])

W: R13 was indeed the best move. 

In this particular case you do not need to care about liberties.

The black group at S16 can not get an eye, while your group at the top (O18) already got one eye.

If you have one eye and your opponent does not, you can not lose the capturing race.]
