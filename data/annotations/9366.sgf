C[Hi reviewer.
Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[po];B[pl];W[np]TR[pl]
C[Comm:

W can't play like this with the marked stone, b can figth actively]
;B[oo]C[Comm:

Right move to punish w];W[op];B[pp];W[on];B[qo];W[no];B[qn]
TR[np]C[Comm:

Very good result for B, the marked stone is not in the right place]
;W[ip];B[cn]TR[ip]C[Q: is this the right idea here? I wasn't happy with the moyo white ended up getting here...

Comm:

This is correct move in this situation, left side is most important now]
;W[cl];B[cq]TR[ip]C[Comm:

Yes, the corner has more value. It also makes w's marked stone inefficient]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[dn]
(;B[jl]C[Q: What about this move... i was thinking reduce his potential and expand mine... but this stone didn't end up working well for me....

Comm:

Risky descision to play here (see var.)]
(;W[kg]C[Q: How best to deal with this weird  floating white stone?

Comm:

Strange move by w (see var.)]
(;B[nl]C[Comm:

This move is trying connecting b's stones and develops rigth side. However right side is too open (see var)]
;W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm]C[Comm:

B gains];W[jm]C[Comm:

W is trying to protect lower area. However this touching weak stone.]
;B[km]C[Comm:

Correct move, many forcing moves for b];W[kn]
(;B[kl]C[Comm:

Too passive? (see var.)];W[im];B[ln];W[lo];B[il]C[Comm:

Again, too passive, w is too strong here];W[qf]C[Q: ideas? I have to make a lot of points in this area... which didn't end up happening...]

(;B[nd]C[Comm:

This move makes it too easy for w (see var.)];W[qi];B[qe]C[Comm:

Now it's fine for b];W[pf];B[jn];W[ko];B[hm];W[in];B[hn];W[io]
;B[gl]LB[hk:A][gl:B]C[Comm:

Bad timing for this. Also B at A is better, leaves useless nozoki for w.]
;W[ld]C[Q: I have thickness and white now has two groups... I tried a splitting attack but it didn't work out... any ideas about how to best attack these two groups?

Comm:

Very wrong move for w, should have connected his stones];B[nf]
;W[jd];B[id];W[jc]
(;B[ie]C[Comm:

You don't need to follow your opponent (see var.)];W[qc];B[re]
;W[oe];B[od];W[ne];B[me];W[md];B[mf];W[rf];B[mb]LB[ob:A]C[Comm:

Correct move to defend b's group is at A];W[jf];B[oi]LB[oh:A]
C[Comm:

Wrong shape, leaves weakness at A];W[ob];B[nc]LB[nb:A]C[Comm:

Again, wrong shape, leaves very useful frocing move at A for w]
;W[lb];B[rc];W[rb];B[qd];W[sc];B[sd]C[easyloss [1d\]: hah

Comm:

Now it's very big ko];W[rd]C[easyloss [1d\]: not looking good!]
;B[of];W[se];B[pe]C[Comm:

W gains];W[hg]C[Now the game is pretty much over. white can  connect his group with O18 so there is no attack...]

(;B[fg]C[Comm:

Too slack (see var.)];W[gf];B[ff];W[fe];B[ee];W[ed];B[fd];W[ge]
;B[df];W[de];B[ef]C[Comm:

Very heavy shape for B];W[ch];B[jh]C[Comm:

Wrong timing, just fixing w's shape];W[if];B[fi];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[jb]C[Comm:

Very painful for b];B[cb];W[gb];B[hc];W[ha];B[fb];W[bb];B[ba]
;W[bc];B[fa];W[ga];B[ia];W[ja];B[gc];W[ia];B[he];W[og];B[lf]

;W[go]LB[ie:C][gl:B][il:A]C[easyloss [1d\]: thx
Moon9 [2d\]: thx

Comm:

B had very good fuseki, but many mistakes in middle game lead to big treoubles. A, B was very slow, C was just following opponent, many mistakes in shape caused collapse of b's position. Try to think more about urgent places and be more cautious next time.
Hope my review helped you a bit.])
(;B[dg]TR[nr]C[Comm:

If you are trying to attack, you should use forcing moves like this. But maybe you should start play big yose moves already.]
))
(;B[ph];W[qh];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]C[Comm:

W has no time to play on the top])
(;B[nh]C[Comm:

This simple move is looks very good too]))
(;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[qk]C[Comm:

W is under attack]))
(;B[im];W[jn]LB[im:A][jn:B]C[Comm:

After this exchange b can leave these stones as is, right side is the most urgent area now.]
))
(;B[pg]C[Comm:

B can play one the right side first. It is very valuable and puts preassure on w's stone in the center, w has no time to attack b's stone severely]
))
(;W[nl]C[Comm:

W should divide b. Also vital point for developing right side.]
)
(;W[qf]TR[jl]C[Comm:

W can also just play here. I am not sure if b can use marked stone well now.]
))
(;B[nl]LB[pf:A]C[Comm:

This is an easi way to  reduce w's moyo. It also makes right side developable for b.
However right side is very open, so you can also consider to play around A first since w is not going to close this moyo in one move anyway]
