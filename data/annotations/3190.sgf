C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe. Thank you for a chance to look over your game, I hope you find my comments to be of use.  I precede all comments with "buckyyowza"]
;B[pp]C[In this game I felt I got behind in the game, later on I caught up, but the game ended in disaster. I would particularly like some comments as to when who is ahead.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[on]C[buckyyowza: Although this is joseki, I find that it gives me a difficult result when I play this way against the san ren sei.  See var for a bit more common joseki to play here.  What happens now is that black gets sabaki on the right side and white ends up down a stone in this area with no solid base.  This would be perfectly OK because white's shape is also light and has good center influence, but the black stone at K4 makes it difficult to manage, see also variation on W14 for the continuation of this joseki and how it might be used.]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pk];B[pl]
(;W[qk]TR[on][qn][rp]C[This probably isnt joseki, or is it? I think P8 probably would have been better.

buckyyowza:  yes, this play is very bad. Not only is P8 urgent, but it is also joseki (see var).  Now white's three stones are cut and black starts out the game with an easy 30 point lead.]
;B[ol];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[qm];W[po]LB[cj:B][lm:A]TR[on][qn]
[rp]C[S6 better?

buckyyowza: After R9, I would sacrifice these stones, using them to support light play around M7 later in the game.  I do not see an easy sabaki to make them live, and without any thick framework facing these stones they cannot escape without a trade off and are therefore just bad aji.  Trying to make them live now may succeed, but will be very expensive for white -- most likely black will get a huge area on the lower side.  I think your best play here is to not become too attached to these stones and just take a big point.  I'd choose C10 or a similar point on the left side because that would have the greatest long-term benefit for your weak group.]
;B[rn];W[qp];B[pq];W[mn]C[buckyyowza: to elaborate, watch how this develops.  White has nowhere to run, and black can simultaneously attack the dragon and build an impenetrable moyo below.]
;B[ro]C[buckyyowza: black is thinking too small here, giving white a chance to run through the center, see W28.]
;W[qo];B[rq]
(;W[so]LB[lk:A]C[buckyyowza: Black's group may seem weak, but it has six liberties and full run of the center.  It can also act as a wall to push white's group into that oppressive lower side.  These attacks on black's group against the side are of little use as white cannot connect through here and this play does little to reduce black.  I think your best bet is a large knights jump to M9 instead of this.  You cannot contain black's dragon but the idea of it will improve your situation by carving a path to the upper left corner.  If black then connects at T4, it will be gote for black leaving white an even game and sente.]

(;B[sq];W[sp];B[nm]C[Here I had failed somehow. BUt is it really that bad?]
;W[nn];B[ll];W[mp]LB[jn:A]C[buckyyowza: You should have put more pressure on black's Q8 group from the center instead of preventing the connection at T4.  Now, N4 is only attacking strong groups with a weak group.  It would be better to try and give your groups some more strength so it can be used to attack, prehaps jump to K6 instead.  Again, this is all because you are attacking black's san ren sei formation in the direction that it is strong.]
;B[mq]
(;W[lq]LB[km:A]C[buckyyowza: white misreads here.  A stone at L7 will allow white to escape using the aji of a stone at M3. see var.]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[nq];W[kp];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[km]
;B[jn];W[mm];B[ml];W[nk];B[nl];W[jm];B[in];W[im]C[Is it right to push that far here, or am I just helping black?

buckyyowza: you are not really helping black any more than you already have.  The more liberties you can have exposed to the center, the better chance you will have of reducing some of black's lead, which is still about 30 points.  Therefore, I think this sort of play is good as long as you can keep sente.]
;B[hn]
(;W[jj]LB[ok:A]C[buckyyowza: this jump is not needed to keep your dragon alive.  I would rather play at P9 to put pressure on black's group and reap benefit in the form of right side moyo. see var.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[oi];B[mi];W[mh]C[I felt a little insecure leaning onto the big black group, while having all these cuttingpoints ...

buckyyowza: leaning is a good idea since black still only has one eye.  White's cutting points are fairly safe, but you will want to be careful not to force black to run over your dragon.]
;B[ki];W[lh];B[kj];W[jk];B[ji];W[hj];B[ii];W[gk]C[The right move?

buckyyowza:  Yes.  Actually white is playing well for some moves, and has reduced black's lead to about 10 points.]
;B[gm]C[I was happy that black played here. Though he obviously was trying to steal my eyes I felt he was helping me attack his black group.

buckyyowza: actually it looks like black is still building his huge space in the lower side.  Both the white and black dragons are very hard to kill now.  However, the lower left is looking like a massive win for black.]

(;W[gh]LB[dk:D][ek:A][cn:C][cq:B]C[buckyyowza: Although this does not hurt, it is not really needed to get your dragon connected out, and black's big moyo is growing unchecked.  So, G12 could be seen as an overplay.  I would attack the lower left corner now, for example with C3 or C6.  An even better idea might be to play E9 to push in to black's moyo first before playing C3.  Now, black can respond at D9 and steal your left side potential while increasing the difficulty of invading his lower left corner.]
;B[ij];W[ik]C[Blacks moves are very strange here since white is really already out into the open. I thought they looked rather low kyu...

buckyyowza: Yes, black's timing is strange.  These are endgame moves, or to be saved for the event that white can be cut off, since all these plays accomplish is removing an eye.]

[qi][ri][si][pj][qj][rj][sj]C[Here I felt like I was perhaps ahead. But was I?

buckyyowza: Including komi, I still have black ahead by about 5-10 points because of the lower side.  To illustrate what I am counting, squares are black points, and circles are white points.  Since half of the board is yet undecided, these points are largely arbitrary.  Also, white has a bit thicker position even though black has a few more points.  All in all, a very close game at this point.]
;W[kg]LB[nc:A][cj:B]C[Here I think I madesomething of the same kind of mistake as black did just before. I should probably have played M 16  Or perhaps even K16?

buckyyowza: O17 is best.  Do not try to kill black, just take a lot of area threatening him.  O17 protects the upper right corner and builds heavily on right side moyo.  Black still needs to find another eye or a base to connect to, and the white stone at H14 makes makes this the right direction to block next.  After O17 if black takes a second eye, it will be gote and white can play big at C10 and win easily.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[jd];W[ke]LB[gc:C][nc:A][nd:B][cj:D]C[buckyyowza: Again, O16 or O17 is best.  You will have to give black something here, just try to keep it small.  If black jumps with G17 for example, C10 is a perfect trade.]
;B[je];W[hd]LB[kf:A]C[buckyyowza: it is more important to play L14 to close the gap in your boundary than to try and build on the left upper side.  The right upper side is more interesting to black because of all the aji from his big dragon, so I would work harder to protect it.  This L14 aji, in fact, is part of what comes back to bites you, causing you to resign the game ;-)]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[nc];B[rd]C[Here I thought black played better than me.

buckyyowza: both this invasion and the invasion on the upper left later on end in gote for black, and are played when the left side is still much more interesting. Since you get to the left side first, I think white plays better until the endgame starts.  As far as responding to the invasions, I think you do rather well but you could do about 4-5 points better in the upper left.]
;W[qe];B[qc];W[pc];B[re];W[rf];B[qf];W[rg];B[pb];W[ob];B[rb]

(;W[ld]LB[pa:E][me:C][cf:A][qf:D][cj:B]TR[md]C[buckyyowza: this is very small at this point.  Now is a good time to play C14 or C10 to make up the points lost by the corner invasion. Not only that, but M16 and N16 make a heavy shape.  To strengthen this area, it is better to play N15, because black has a lot of good aji here: most notably R14.  If you are inclined, there is also a delayed ko situation at Q19 (see var).  This a ko that is no big enough to fight right now, but can be prepared for in the mean time.]
;B[kd];W[ic]LB[le:A]C[buckyyowza: it is better to connect at M15. Though it is possible, black is still hard to kill and white has the potential to get enough to win the game using the upper left sides and corner.  there is also still potential for damaging black's lower right moyo.  In fact, it appears that white is now enjoying a 5-10 point lead because of the H16/J17 stones and the left upper side moyo, so there is no need to try and kill black's dragon right away.]
;B[le];W[me]
(;B[jc]C[buckyyowza: black lives more simply at K18, this is more complicated (for black).]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[ib];B[lb];W[jb];B[nd];W[ne];B[ma]C[Was black already safe here? Because I certainly couldnt have gone for a ko, could I?

buckyyowza: Black is safe because white is ahead and has sente :-)  If you really needed this kill, ko would be the way to do it.  It is best to give up this kill and take your sente over to the left side, where the game is still quite interesting.]

(;W[nb];B[oa];W[ck]C[Too far from the corner? Should I have entered san-san here?

buckyyowza: grins :-) C9 is perfect];B[cc]C[buckyyowza: black should not ignore the lower left, there is more at stake there.]

(;W[bc]C[buckyyowza: should be F18, see var.];B[bb];W[db];B[cb]
;W[bd];B[fc];W[ed]C[Was this result acceptable for white. I thought so, since I got sente.

buckyyowza: It is not best, but a good result.  See W128 for the more typical play.]
;B[gb]
(;W[cn]C[buckyyowza: This is a good choice, but I'd rather play the invasion at C3, which is about 4 points bigger.  Ignoring what is about to happen in the upper right, this is a very close game with white slightly in the lead, so 4 points really do matter at this late stage.]
;B[dn];W[cp]C[What would have been the best move here?

buckyyowza: this seems OK.  C3 is probably a little better, but works out much the same.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[bq];B[cq];W[bp];B[cr];W[cm];B[el];W[dm]
LB[em:A]TR[el]C[Bad move I guess. But I was lucky

buckyyowza: sente is always good in the endgame.  If black ignores this stone, white will get in through E7 or lose the stone at E8.]
;B[em];W[ej];B[ge]
(;W[he]LB[gd:A]C[buckyyowza: too timid!  Cut at G16 is perfectly safe, see var.  Now white gives up the lead.]

(;W[oc]C[Yes, I know, he could have broken through here all the time ...

buckyyowza: this play should be at O16.  I think you can probably see why ;-)]
;B[na];W[qd]LB[kh:A]C[buckyyowza: white is asking for trouble, play L12 first. Both plays are 1 point gote, but L12 removes the bad aji.]
;B[dk];W[dj];B[bs];W[hc];B[gc];W[ha];B[ga];W[se];B[sd];W[sf]
C[Fugl [7k\]: do you know how much?

buckyyowza: now it is black by 12.  White lost his lead mostly because of the 10 points black gained starting with G15.  White also did not take enough of the lower left and gave up sente too easily. In all white dropped about 16 points in the last 40 moves.]
;B[kh];W[hh];B[jg];W[lg]C[This was the losing move ...

buckyyowza: ah no, it was H16 :-)  This is definitely a cute sequence though.]
;B[pe];W[od];B[oe];W[nd];B[nf]C[buckyyowza: an excellent game!  Thank you for the opportunity to look it over, I have enjoyed going through this game quite a bit.  In all I think you played very well and if not for some careless reading were well matched with your opponent.  Specific points you may want to work on:

1) point your joseki in the right direction.  Whether or not you know the standard sequence, you need to play the opening in a way that strengthens your stones while weakening your opponent's.  Your opening accomplished quite the opposite, although it did make for a spectacular battle ;-)  If you had opened a little stronger, there is no way black could have won given the way you played the middle game.

2) watch out for weak spots in your boundaries.  Not just this last sequence, but after you peeped at O9, it left a tewari situation just as if black had peeped at P8.  Allowing black to play at P9 turned O9 into a thank-you move.  The same thing happened again when you ignored the weakness at L14.  If you had closed up there, black would have attacked more the upper left and you could have kept big points in the upper right.

Thanks again for the chance to look over this game.  Please let me know if you have any further questions or troubles regarding this review.  You may also feel free to look for me as bucky on KGS.]

White still needs a stone at Q7 to solidify this position, but that is generally considered too slow to play right away because it is gote.  You will normally see Q7 as an attack by black in the middle game after this sequence.  With this variation, white will want to aim at invasion around F3 to keep the board balanced (which is one reason why K4 complicates this joseki), and black will want to attack the upper side to ensure that white's dragon has to struggle to live.]
