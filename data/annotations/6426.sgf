C[Hey !

This game may not be an even one, i (mianreg, Black) learned the rules a few weeks ago. Thithus is a regular player, hence that game was, in a way, pedagogic...
We ran out of time so I did resign but I guess I played this game seriously until the end.

My e-mail is : azzerrtyyuiiopp@yahoo.fr

Favourite languages :
French,
else German or English ; your call :o)

Thanks for helping !

[Broege: All the comments are made as this one - in square brackets, at the end of the node.\]]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]LB[qk:A]C[[Broege: Another common pattern is for Black to play A - this is known as Chinese Fuseki. Please refer to http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseFuseki if you want to know more about this pattern.\]]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq]C[mianreg [16k\]: bon, on va se la jouer classique]
;B[iq]LB[cn:B][dn:C][fq:A]C[[Broege: Black A seems to be a suboptimal choice now - the bottom side is very low after the joseki played.
Please note that White B is not the most common answer - typically White would answer at C, making a higher position for himself.\]]
;W[qj]C[I don't know joseki so well either, so if you already have critics, please go on :o)]
;B[qm]LB[ql:A][po:C][qo:B]C[[Broege: This seems too far from the corner to be fully safe and at the same time not really pressuring White - so I would recommend A, B or C, depending whether you want to pressure White (A) or close the corner (B or C).
But this is more a matter of taste than knowledge.\]];W[qf]

(;B[nd]LB[qf:A][qh:B][qm:C]C[[Broege: I always feel that White A is an overplay, aimed at tricking Black into the standard response - please see the variant two moves down for a possible continuation.
Yet cutting at B is rather premature for Black (especially that the C stone is further off) as White shoould easily escape.\]]
;W[rd];B[qc]
(;W[pj]LB[ph:A][qh:B]C[Is this move a loss of time for w ?

[Broege: No, White should play a move to strengthen this group. I would rather expect a move at A.
If White ignores this area and Black plays B, White will have a hard time keeping both his groups safe.\]]
;B[pg]LB[jc:B][lc:C][og:A]C[Relevant ?

[Broege: Depends on your aim.
If you wanted to cut White - it does not work, as shown by the next White move.
If you wanted to put a stone as a forcing move - it can be, although I think A would be better - it still threatens to cut and is more strongly connected to the Black group above.
Typical continuation for Black here is B - the corner group needs to be defended against White C.
As it is unlikely that after Black B White will play a move around A (it would obtain only overconcentrated stones), Black should finish his shape with B and wait with A or the move played for later.\]]
;W[qg];B[ph]C[[Broege: This obtains nothing important.
The two Black stones does not form a wall with the corner group (they are not connected strongly enough), nor do they take any territory.
The only thing they do is to solidify White group so White does no longer have to worry about it - not something Black should do.\]]
;W[qh];B[jc]TR[pg][qg][ph][qh]C[[Broege: Imagine this position without the triangled stones.
Isn't it better for Black? Black stones are practically the same and White still needs to worry (even if only slightly) about his side group.\]]
;W[dg];B[fc]LB[gc:A]C[[Broege: This is an overplay - extention at A would be safe.\]]
;W[hc]C[Here, I don't really know what to do.
My own stone left is in a pincer. I may attack, but if you see the result in the game, I get caught...]
;B[ge]LB[db:B][cc:C][gd:D][id:E][fe:A]C[I chose : flee and surround...

[Broege: You can't flee and surround the White stone at the same time, at least not yet.
So Black is left with two main choices:
A - to escape into the centre quickly
B - to dive into the corner, expecting White C, and then escape
Black can also play D to put some pressure on White pincer - but after White E Black is still in danger.\]]
;W[id];B[jd];W[if];B[gg]LB[ge:A]TR[fd][gd]C[[Broege: Black move at A left a cut (as marked) - so he needs to be careful in his escape into the centre.\]]
;W[dj]TR[fc][ge][gg]C[[Broege: White is expoiting Black weakness by large extentions - and Black cannot cut as it would put his marked group in grave danger.\]]
;B[fj]LB[fc:G][ee:F][fh:A][gh:B][fi:C][gi:D][gj:E]C[[Broege: Such a large extension from a weak group is rarely good. White can cut if he chooses so (imagine for example White A, Black B, then C, D and E) - so Black does not really put pressure on White stone.
And if there is no pressure applied and the stone does not strengten own group - why play such a move anyway?
Perhaps a move at F would be better? It protects all the cuts and cannot be easily ignored by White. Of course it gives White some solid shape - but that's to be expected following Black overplay at G.\]]
;W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[ij]LB[ee:D][he:B][hg:C][hj:A]C[[Broege: This stone can be disconnected (as shown in the game).
I understand that you rejected A as being too slow - and perhaps rightly so. In such a situation Black should first cover his cutting points with a few forcing moves (B, C, perhaps D) and only then try to apply force to White stones.\]]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[gi]
(;B[hj]LB[fi:A]C[[Broege: This is a very costly mistake - Black allows to cut off his stones and they are already almost captured.
Perhaps playing A and sacrificing the ataried stone would be better? Please see the variation.
Automatically protecting a stone in atari is a dangerous instinct - your opponent will for sure make some use of that.\]]
;W[fi];B[gj];W[ei];B[hb]C[Obviously a mistake

[Broege: I would call it "a nice try" - even if it was not executed properly. Please see the variations.\]]
;W[gb]
(;B[cc]C[For I guess I would lose my stone in this area, I get the corner as a little compensation.

[Broege: Good thinking if you were sure to loose your stones.
Of course saving them would be better ;-)\]];W[dc];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb]
(;W[fb];B[be];W[cf];B[ce]C[b14 wrong ?

[Broege: B14 is OK here - it cannot be cut and it gives Black some more space to live in.\]]
;W[de]
(;B[cd]LB[je:C][kg:D][om:B][fo:E][lp:A]C[[Broege: It is not needed - see the variations at the previous move.
So it's much better to take some bigger move now - perhaps A or B or E or C+D sequence.\]]
;W[bf]
(;B[fo]LB[ad:C][nj:B][fo:A][lp:D]C[A18 is gote, so...

[Broege: A18 is not needed, is it?
My first choice would be D but A also seems OK (well, it was one of the four ideas a move back).\]]
;W[qo]C[Tricky but I consider it as dubious, for I get thickness in the center, to a giant moyo.

[Broege: You need to use the thickness you obtain. For me this seems a sound strategy for White - at least assuming that Black is much weaker and thus will not be able to put this thickness to a good use. For evenly matched players - I would have reservations but still not reject this move.\]]
;B[pn]LB[qp:A]TR[qm][qo]C[[Broege: How about A? It protects the corner and puts some good pressure on White. Of course it means an all-out fight between the marked stones so Black should check he knows what he's doing.\]]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[po];B[oo];W[qn];B[om]LB[qp:A]C[[Broege: Forcing moves first. After Black plays A White will have to connect to the upper group and Black will take the corner and a wall on the outside.\]]
;W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[nk]LB[fm:E][km:D]
[nn:C][np:B][op:A]C[[Broege: White has gained quite a lot - it destroyed a good chunk of Black potential territory and what's more converted it to White territory.
Black's moyo is still only a moyo and not territory. White can play cut at A and take another chunk of Black territory or play forcing moves at B, C and then invade somewhere around D and hope that he will be able to escape upwards or to the left or to live inside.
If White does not want to risk everything with such a deep invasion he can reduce at E or play the cut at A.]
;W[lj]TR[fj][gj][hj][ij][nk][om][pn][fo][oo][pp][fq][iq][pq]
[dr][pr]C[[Broege: Another way to play a reduction.\]];B[lk]
C[From that point I guess there are lots of mistakes to come right in the center, and I lose a big part of my moyo.

[Broege: Not yet knowing what lies ahead I would expect that even without any Black mistakes the moyo will be greatly reduced.\]]
;W[kk]C[Is L10 solid ? I couldn't read through it.

[Broege: Do you mean "can Black cut?". Let's see the variations. Definitely Black can cut - but in the following fight White will be probably better off.\]]

(;B[hl]LB[jj:A][il:B]C[What else ?..

[Broege: You can also try to counteratack - for example by playing A. White will connect (if not he will have to live inside Black moyo and then it is slightly weaker.
Or you could play B and try geta for the next move - as in the variant shown a move earlier.\]]
