DS: as earlier, W should have played at R12. Then this wouldn't be an =
issue.  Now W will have to try to kill B, or chase B toward the center.  =
Either way, W's stones a R6 now are also in danger.  W at Q12 probably =
won't be enough to kill.  Try to learn to play calm moves and try not to =
fight at every opportunity.  See variation.  Often it is better to =
harrass a group, make them live but gain influence or territory.  Kill =
only if you are SURE you can =
kill.];B[ri];W[sg];B[pi];W[ph];B[pk];W[oj];B[ql];W[oi];B[ok]

not needed. Even if B gets to link up , W creates a great wall facing =

>felt I was losing here by about 25 points,
>so I tried to mix it up, but I didn't really do a >good job of that.

DS: Counting takes practice.  I use the following method:=20
1.  Count dead and captured stones and figure difference plus or minus =
the komi.=20
2. Count defined areas by groups of 2 or 3's.  Add up the score.

I can now do this is about 1 - 2 min. But with practice should be able =
to do this in 30 sec.

Here:
1.  Dead W =3D 5 stones
     Dead B =3D 14 Stones
     komi =3D .5 =20
     therefore add 9.5 to W's area score.

2   B's area =3D 51 pairs (about) =3D 102 points
3   W's area =3D 34 pairs (about) =3D 68 points

adding 9.5 to W =3D 77.5 points to 102, so you are on target with being =
behind by 25 points.

However, W's move at C11 is nonsense.  You should try to make the best =
move possible, even when losing, not just try a move hoping that your =
opponent will make a mistake.  =];B[cj];W[af];B[bh];W[ag];B[ah]

DS: the game is close now.  But and W must play at B2.  See var. =
Otherwise W is dead.  Learning when to defend and when to attack is =
difficult. Making mistakes like this helps though! :)

DS: See my comments above about counting.  Try to observe dan level =
players and count their games while observing.  This will give you the =
practice to count while not worrying about the clock and you next move.]
