C[Hello Thomas,

My name is Frank and I will review this game.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].

Hope this helps!

Frank

dear reviewer,

In this game, I did my very best. It is a game of a tournament. It endet as w+10(or more). When the record endet, I think it was a close game. In the endgame, I think, I lost some points. The endgame is not listed anymore, so you cannot take care of it. Nonetheless, I'd like you to find my technical weaknesses besides the endgame, so I have an idea on what I should concentrate my further study. Therefore, I don't have any specific question.

best regards
thomas kiefer

(;B[ek]C[[Frank\] I think your reading is good.

I think, I misread here, but E8 gets very complicated, or do you have an Idea for a pretty forced sequence?]

;W[mp];B[lq]C[[Frank\] For my final comments, I think you can work on positional judgment.  Too many times it looked like you thought W was developing too well so you needed to disrupt, but you ended up ruining your own development too.  It's important to remember that you only need one point over half the board to win.  If you become less greedy and more thoughtful about invasions and reductions, I think you can improve.

Anyway, I hope this helps and Happy New Years :)
