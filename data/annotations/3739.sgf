C[SC: I will use my initials before my comments to help identify them.]
;B[dp]C[WinterKing [21k?\]: hey];W[pq]C[Sec [?\]: hi :)];B[pd]
;W[qo]C[SC: By securing this corner, white is allowing black to play the first move in 3 corners.  White will need to attack these corners to gain territory.  This is neither bad nor good, it is just something black should recognize and mentally prepare for.]
;B[dd];W[dj]C[SC: This is a bit passive for white after playing twice in the same corner.]
;B[dh]SQ[jd][jc][jp][jq][oc][ec][eq]C[SC:This is also a bit small for this early in the opening.  White has too much space to be effectivly attacked, so this is just an extension from the top left corner.  This is too large an extension to secure the top left corner and is a bit small for an early opening game extension.  I think that the squares are all better moves.

A good rule of thumb for the opening is to look for the largest open area and play inside it.  In this case, any of the squares would be examples of playing inside  one of the two largest areas. You  will note that I didn't place any squares around O3.  White is too strong to approach closely.]
;W[dm];B[ej]C[SC:  Again, this is still the opening, so the suggestions from last move are still better.  The current move is a midgame move. Once the big empty spaces have some stones in them, this move could be useful to reduce white and enlarge black.
This is a good move, but not yet.];W[dk];B[ek];W[jd];B[ge]TR[hc]
SQ[jq][jp][pj][qj][eq][qe]C[SC: This is not the largest open space.  The squares are all better opening game moves.
Also, this move is on the fifth line from the top side.  This is far enough into the center that it can be easily undercut by white playing around H17.  Black can secure the top left better by playing at one of E17, F17, or G17.  E17 would secure the corner better while G17 would claim more of the top side but leave the corner more open to invasion.]
;W[md];B[ne]TR[hd][he][if][jf][kf][lf][mf][nf][oe][od][nb][ib]
[jb][kb][lb][mb]SQ[oc][hc]MA[ic][id][ie][je][ke][kd][kc][jc]
[lc][ld][le][me][nd][nc][mc]C[SC: Still too soon to start a contact fight.  If you really want to attack this white group, then consider P17 or H17 (The squares). Both of these moves limit white's ability to expand along the side and will probably push white towards running out into the center.
The best attack moves are not contact moves (right next to the opponent's stones as shown by the Xs).  The best attack moves are usually one space away from you opponent.  The triangles are all one space away from the white group.  Not all of them are good attack moves, but I wanted to show what I mean by one space away.]
;W[qg];B[jp]C[SC: Good, this is playing in the largest empty space.  Now the opening is about over.  Someone could play around R9 as an opening game move, but otherwise the opening is finished.
In the middle game, you should try to expand your area and reduce white's area by attacking any weak white groups.  You should try to strengthen any weak groups you have as well.  The R13 stone is the weakest white group currently.  Black doesn't have any weak groups currently.]
;W[gc]
(;B[gd]TR[hd][id]SQ[ec]C[SC:  The square is better for defending the corner.  The triangles are better for attacking white's group.  Finally, the black stones in this area are not weak or in any real danger.  So, black could ignore this move and attack the white stone at R13.  The best move is  not always next to your opponent's last stone.
See the variation.];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[je];W[kd];B[ke]SQ[ie]
C[SC: consider connecting at J15 instead.  In this game, on move 222 white does cut by playing at J15.  So, connecting here now would have saved you some trouble 200 moves later.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[nc]SQ[pc][md]C[SC: This is a bit too far inside white's group and could be easily cut off.  Imagine a line from Q17 to N16.  Anything above and to the left of this line is a dangerous (dangerous to black) invasion.
Eventually, white kills all of the black stones around O17.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[oc]TR[of]SQ[nc]C[SC: Black neds to stop and think before trying to save the marked stone.  It is all alone behind enemy lines and there isn't much room for black to make 2 eyes.  

I think black should give up on the stone for now and play P14. P14 protects black's cutting point at P15 but puts more pressure on the R13 stone than if black just connected by playing at P15.

Later, black could try to save this stone as a ko threat.  Black should be able to get severak ko threats out of this area before white finishes killing these stones.]
;B[mc];W[lc];B[mb];W[nb];B[ob];W[pb];B[na];W[lb];B[pa];W[qa]
;B[rc];W[oa]TR[cl][pp][qq][ql][qc]SQ[me]C[SC: Now black needs to look for a ko threat.  If white responds to black's ko threat, then black can capture by playing Q19. If white isn't able to find enough good ko threats, then black can ignore one threat and capture the 4 stones around Q17 by playing at R18.
The best ko threats are threats that would get you out of the ko some other way.  Here, an example of this is N15.  If white ignores this and plays O18, then black can capture 2 stones by playing M16 and save the three black stones at N17.  This means that white "wins" the ko, but black saves most of the threatened stones anyway.  This type of ko threat is best since you essentially win even if white ignores your threat and takes the ko.
Once you have used up the local ko threats (meaning the ones involving the same groups as the ko involves) then look around the board for ko theats.  The triangles are all moves that white is likely to respond to.  The corner invasion is particularly useful since black can play several ko threats here before white will be able to completely kill the invading stones.
White will probably play 3x3 point invasions of both left side corners as ko threats.
In this case, white will be able to use the 3x3 corner invasions to create a large number of ko threats and will be able to win the ko.  If black can figure this out, then the best plan is to ignore the ko and do something else.  If white also ignores the ko and responds to black, then either side can come back to the ko later in the game.  50 moves from now, black might have more ko threats than white and be able to win the ko.  Even if white finishes capturing the ko now, black will get to play a stone somewhere else in exchange and can hopefully make some profit from this.]
;B[pf]SQ[oe]C[SC: This guards the cutting point at P15 and makes contact with the R13 stone.  Contact fights tend to make both side's groups get stronger.  So, making a contact play against stones that are weaker than yours is generally not good since the weaker group benefits most from both sides getting stronger.
Here, the R13 stone is weak.  If we assume that black's stones around O18 are dead (meaning we think white can win the ko) then the black stones around Q16 are also weak.  This makes the contact play a reasonable idea.
If we thought that black could win the ko and that the white stones around Q17 were dead, then black would be too strong here to play this contact move.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[nb]C[SC: White captures and actually creates a new, but related, ko. This means that black gets what amounts to a free move since white is taking a move to kill stones that black has already given up as dead.]
;B[pj]C[SC: Good, this helps surround the two white stones nicely.]
;W[ma]C[SC: White has spent a lot of effort to finish off the black stones. Meanwhile, black has been gaining elsewhere.  I think black has gained more from the last few moves since the black stones around N17 were dead anyway as long as white has more ko threats.  White should have waited until the number of ko threats became more equal to finish capturing these stones.]
;B[oh]SQ[pg][qg]C[SC: The marked white stones look pretty much dead.  Black has gained enough territory on the right side to about make up for the loss in the upper right corner.]
;W[ql];B[pk]TR[pg][qg]SQ[qj]C[SC: White's last move threatens to connect to the marked white stones and save them.  You need to play R10 to keep the marked white stones surrounded.  You could play on S10 as well, but that is a more complicated.   This move is the beginning of black losing the entire right side to white.

Try to keep your opponent's  weak groups seperated.  You want white to have as many weak groups as possible to worry about.

Don't bother trying to seperate two strong/alive groups.];W[rj]
;B[qi];W[ri]
(;B[qh]C[SC: See the variation.  This is not a cutting move and you need to cut white apart here.]
;W[rh];B[rf]TR[ci][cn]SQ[ec][mq][gq]C[SC: This does gain about 2 points for black while forcing white to connect.  This is a good move, but the time to do it is when there are no moves worth more than 2 points left on the board. All of the marked moves are worth more than two points.  The triangles are also probably Sente, since white should respond to the to defend the side group.

Don't play endgame moves until the endgame.];W[rg];B[qk]TR[qj]
SQ[pj][pk]C[SC: Black has made an empty triangle here.  It is called empty because there is no white stone at R10.  Whenever you start to make an empty triangle, pause and reconsider.  Unless you are making eyes to help a surrounded group live, then making an empty triangle is NOT the best move.]
;W[rk]C[Sec [?\]: i feel like i'm just blundering aound %)]
;B[pm]C[WinterKing [21k?\]: well if you've only just started playing that's natural

SC: This stone should be at Q8 if you want to play in this area. The current move is too easy for white to cut off.
A bigger question is whether this area is worth the most at this point in the game.  Both of the left side corners are still open to a white invasion.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[qm];B[pn]SQ[om]C[WinterKing [21k?\]: that's how i felt about 3 weeks ago

SC: This leaves too many places that white could cut black.  This move should be at P7 if you still want to play in this area. Playing at P7 would not count as making an empty triangle because of the white stone at Q8.]
;W[qn]C[WinterKing [21k?\]: not much better now, but slightly]
;B[qp]SQ[cn][fq][gq][mq][ci][ec][me]C[SC: This is too far inside white's area.  It is inside the imaginary line running from R5 and Q3.  This stone can be easily cut off and surrounded by white.

The squares are all better moves for black.  In fact, any of the squares would be good moves for white as well.
Many times, if you know your opponent would like to play on a certain spot, playing there yourself first is a good idea.]
;W[pp];B[rp]C[SC: Much like the top right, this looks like an invasion with very little chance of living.  If you have a plan to make this group live or escape to the center, then go ahead.  Even if the plan doesn't work, you should still try it.  If you are blundering around with no clear plan, then move on to a more productive section of the board.]
;W[qq];B[ro];W[rn];B[sn];W[rl];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[sm]SQ[nq]
C[SC: I think that the black stones in the lower right corner are dead, but you should keep playing in this area until you are sure.  In a game with this level of players, it is also possible that your opponent will make an error and let you save them.
Once you have settled whether the stones are alive or dead, a useful place to play would be O3.  This move blocks white from expanding along the lower side and helps secure black's area on the lower side.]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[nq];W[so];B[nr]C[SC: Good, this secures the lower side even more and is Sente since white will respond at P2.]
;W[or];B[os]C[SC: This an endgame move.  It worked out to be sente in this game, but white could have ignored it.  You should save endgame moves worth only a few points until the actual end of the game. See the variation starting next move.]

(;W[ps]C[SC: See the variation and be sure to read the text at the very end of the variation.]
;B[ns]
(;W[qs]C[SC: White doesn't need to make this move and could take Sente here.  See variation.  Be sure to read the text at the end of the variation.]
;B[en]SQ[me][oo][em][om]C[SC: This looks like black wants to make territory in the center. Center territory is very hard to get since you have to surround all four sides.  In this case, white has several marked places to break in and reduce black's center.

In the end, black has only one area of central territory expanding into the top left corner.  It is no coincidence that white finishes the game with three corners and is the winner.]
;W[oo];B[nn]C[SC: Blocking here is fine.];W[po]
(;B[om]TR[no]SQ[pm][pn]C[SC: This is not good.  The first sign is that you made an empty triangle.  The main point is that you are trying to save two stones while leaving a more important hole open.  O5 is a major weak point in black's structure.  Later in the game, white pushes in here and ends up capturing the black stones around O3.
See Variation.];W[co];B[cp]C[SC: Good solid block.];W[em]TR[do]
SQ[gk]MA[ec][dc]C[SC: Black needs to decide what he wants to focus on securing. Black can't expect to get all of the lower side and center from column F to column N even though that is roughly surrounded already. When white extends into the center along row 7, each stone adds 2 liberties to white's group and you can only block one of them with your next move.  So, contact plays to defend the entire center is doomed to fail.
You should decide which area to focus on.  You should also block one or more spaces away from white.
The square is a good way to keep white out of the center, but there is still a gap at N15 allowing white access into the center. Note that I would not block at F7.  F7 results in a very complicated running contact fight.  This gives too much chance to make an error and lose something important.
The triangle defends the corner by putting pressure on white's C5 stone.  White won't be pushing into the corner if he is busy defending this stone.
The either of the X's is a good way to defend the top corner. Here, you need to prevent a 3x3 invasion as well as prevent white from extending in from G17.]
;B[el];W[eo]SQ[ep]C[SC: This stone threatens to push into the area aroundG3.  Faced with this, the stone at E6 is insignificant.  Play at E4 here to protect this lower side territory.  If you run a line of stones along the 4th row and white runs a line along the 5th, you will have the lower side secure for almost 40 points.  White will have a line of stones facing the center, but no actual territory to show for them.]
;B[fn];W[ep]TR[eq][do][bo]SQ[gq][gr]C[SC: Now the lower left corner is in great danger.  The territory around K2 is also in danger.  Black needs to pick one to defend. The triangles are options to defend corner.  G3 followed by G2 will defend the K2 area.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[dl]TR[eo][ep]SQ[do]C[SC: The square connects the corner stones out and saves the corner. It also kills the marked white stones.  The first person to play here will own the corner and change the score by around 30 points in his favor.]
;W[cl]SQ[do];B[ck];W[do];B[bm];W[cm];B[ci]C[Sec [?\]: i feel honored by the amount of time you take to respond to this move :)
WinterKing [21k?\]: sorry
WinterKing [21k?\]: got disconnected];W[bk]C[Sec [?\]: n.p. :)]
;B[cj];W[bl];B[bj];W[dq]C[SC: Now black's corner is dead];B[fp]
TR[gq]SQ[fm]C[SC: This is too close to white and it isn't connected to any other black stones.  This makes this stone too weak.  The square works to defend the center.  The triangle defends the lower side.]
;W[fq];B[gp]TR[fm]SQ[hq]C[SC: H3 defends the lower side.  F7 is still good for defending the center]
;W[fo]SQ[fm][gq]C[SC: Play G3 to defend the lower side.  You can play against white since you are extending from a group of stones, not placing a single stone by itself. 
Still F7 for the center.
You need to decide to save either the stones around E6 OR the stones around G4.  You can't do both.]
;B[gn];W[go];B[ho]TR[bk][bl][cl][cm][dm][em][cn][co][do][eo]
[go][fo][ep][dq][fq]SQ[bm][cp][dp][fp][gn][fn][en][dn][gp]C[SC: This is still trying to save both groups, and it doesn't work.  Specifically, this makes too many cutting points.  You have too many small groups of un-connected stones with 3 or fewer liberties.   I have marked 5 seperate black groups in this area that have too few liberties.  In contrast, white has one large group of stones with about 8 liberties.  Since black can't cut at E3, all of the marked white stones count as one group.
Black needs to start connecting these groups together.  Since you can't connect them all at once, you will have to pick which ones to save.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir]C[Sec [?\]: how deptessing..]
;B[jr];W[hr]SQ[fp][gp][hp][ho][iq][jr][jp]C[SC: This is an improvement.  Now all of the marked black stones are one group since white can't cut at J4 or K3.]
;B[is]SQ[me][no][ec][fm]C[SC: This is worth 1 point in Gote.  Very few moves would be worth less than this, so you should be able to find a better move than this.  The squares are all worth much more.]
;W[hs];B[js];W[bp]C[SC: White wastes the Sente you gave him by killing stones that are already dead.  Now black has Sente again.]

(;B[fc]C[SC: This is good.  See the variation for playing this stone on E17.]
;W[fb];B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[gb]
(;B[fd]SQ[ee]C[SC:  This makes 2 empty triangles at once.  White can't cut here, (See variation), but if you really want to protect this point, play at E15 instead.]
;W[da]C[SC: White is making endgame moves now.  This one would cost black about 7 points to ignore.  You need to decided if blocking at N15 or F7 is worth more than 7 points.  Since white could reduce your center by a lot more than 7 points if he pushes in, ignoring this move is worth considering.]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[rb]C[SC: Ignoring this move would cost black about 4 points (including a captured stone).  Anything worth more than 4 points is better then responding to white.]
;B[rd];W[qf]SQ[no][me][fm]C[SC: Ignoring this move is costs black about 2 points.  There are still places worth more than 2 points for black to play.]
;B[qe];W[of];B[pe]SQ[oe]C[SC: P15 is better.  It keeps the black stones all connected together. The black stones around R16 don't have room to make 2 eyes.  They must stay connected to the black stones in the center to live.  Your move saves one stone, but ends up losing more.]
;W[nf];B[me]C[SC:  Good, this keeps the two white stones isolated.]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[oe];B[mg];W[le]C[Sec [?\]: gah

SC: This was the best black could do once white cut off the stones around R16.]
;B[lg]C[SC: Good];W[sc]C[SC: White wastes Sente to kill dead stones again.]

(;B[jj]SQ[fm]C[SC: F7 is best here.  K10 would be more useful if you only had part of the center surrounded.  White might try to make a live group inside your center to reduce it.  In the current circumstances, black should be able to prevent this by driving white into one of black's walls.  If black didn't have the walls all the way around, then a stone at K10 can serve as a place to drive white towards.

See variation.];W[sf]C[SC: White is still killing dead stones.]
;B[ak]C[SC: This is a Gote endgame move worth 1 point.];W[al]
;B[aj];W[re];B[ph]TR[oi]SQ[qh][qi]C[SC: This closes a gap, but not one of the important ones.  If white pushes in here, black can just play at P11 and not worry about the two marked stones.  Losing those two stones costs black 4 points.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[on];B[nm]SQ[mn][mp]C[SC: Connecting is good, but the best spot to connect is N6 or N4.  White will want to play on both N6 and N4 to atari the stone at N5.  You need to prevent this.]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[ll];W[lm];B[kn]SQ[lo]C[SC: M5 is better since it connects weak groups.]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[kq];B[jq];W[mp]
(;B[lo];W[mq]C[Sec [?\]: grrr];B[lp];W[mr];B[mk];W[lq];B[kp]
SQ[fm]C[SC: You could use this move to block the more important gap at F7.]
;W[ms];B[ls]C[SC: If you let white have two moves in a row, he can get 2 points of territory here.  If you respond after the first move, he gets 1 point.  So, any move worth more than 1 point is better than this.]
;W[fm]C[SC: each white stone added to the end of this groups increases the group's liberties by 2.  You can only block one of these liberties with your next move.  So, you have to pick a direction you would prefer white to go and drive him that way.  Your biggest territory is above this stone, so you should play F8 or even G9 to protect your largest area of territory.  This will drive white sideways and eventually could cut off the lower side black stones from the rest.  this means that the lower side group will need to make two eyes.]
;B[gm]C[SC: This drives white into your largest area of territory.]
;W[fl]C[SC: Now white is moving in the direction you have chosen to drive him.]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[hl];W[hj];B[gj]SQ[hk]C[SC: Just connect your stones together at H9.]
;W[hk];B[il];W[hi];B[hh]SQ[in][hd]C[SC: This doesn't do much to block white.  At this time, white has three stones cut off inside your territory.  Unless they can escape out or make two eyes, they are dead.  If they are dead, they all come off of the board at the end of the game. So focus on sealing your borders and preventing eyes.  White can make a long chain of stones all over in here without affecting the score as long as you make sure they don't manage to live.

The squares are good choices.  J6 defends a lot of cutting points. H16 blocks a potential escape route white is moving towards]

;W[ie]SQ[kg]C[SC: Remember 200 moves ago when I suggested connecting at this point?  It can take a long time to see the results of your first moves.  It is important to try, though.  Without noting this cut in relation to a move 200 turns ago, you won't learn as much from your mistakes.

The square fixes some cutting points.  If White captures J16, then play J14 to block.  If white does anything else, consider connecting at H16.  It is better to lose the J16 stone and fix your cutting points than to be cut apart.]

(;B[ec];W[fb];B[eb];W[fc]TR[me][fm][no]SQ[fd]C[SC: At first glance, F16 looks like the next move for Black. It makes an empty triangle, however.  In this game, playing F16 would be fine.  Reading enough to figure out what could be done instead of playing here is probably more than 20-30 kyu players will be doing.

Just to prove a point, I will not play here.  This leaves a gap, but white can't do more than reduce a few points.  Meanwhile, black can make a more important move.  With the loss of the lower left corner, black really needs territory in the center.  This means plugging the remaining gaps leading into the center.  They are marked with triangles.  The O5  point is the least important, so it can be closed last.]

(;W[cc]C[SC: White plays a corner invasion.];B[qs]C[SC: Black tries to attack the corner.]
;W[pr];B[po]C[SC:  This is a good idea.  This cuts the white stones off so we have a capture race.]
;W[qr];B[sr];W[rs]C[SC: black can't play atari at T1 now since that places black in atari at the same time.]
;B[sq]C[SC: Black still can't play Atari at T1 since that still puts black in Atari at the same time.  White, however, can play at T6 and then play Atari on black at T4.  So, black is dead.  In fact, if black plays all the way to this point before realizing that he is dead, he will have managed to die in Gote.  Dying in Gote is very sad.

So, white still has control of the lower right corner and got to make a 20 point move in the upper left corner.

Again, the point is that moves you think should be Sente don't always work out that way.  The less a "Sente" move is worth, the easier it is for your opponent to ignore it and mess up your plans.
It is very tempting to make all of the "Sente" moves you can think of on the board before you make a big, important Gote move (like defending one of the left side corners in this game).  Make the big important moves first, even if they are Gote.  
Save endgame moves until the endgame.]))
(;W[cc]C[SC: White invades the corner.];B[qr]C[SC: Black follows up on the previous move to "punish" white for ignoring it.]
;W[po]C[SC: White connects and is now alive.  White now can focus on killing black.]
;B[sr];W[ps]C[SC: Black could live by connecting to the outside.  White prevents that possibility in Sente.]
;B[ns];W[qs]C[SC: Black needs two eyes.  He should be able to get one at T1. If black can play at T4, then T3 is the second eye.  If black can play at R1, then S2 can be the second eye.  So, white wants to play R1 and T3 before black gets a chance to.  White plays R1 now since playing it after black captures at S1 would put white's stones at Q1 and R1 in Atari.]
;B[rs]C[SC: black is forced to capture.];W[pr]C[SC: If black doesn't connect at S2, then white captures and T1 becomes a false eye.  If black does connect, then white plays on T4 and destroys any chance of a second eye.  This does not become a ko because as soon as white plays on T4, black is absolutely dead and there is nothing for black to "win" by playing a ko. White can ignore everything black does in this corner after white has played at T4.]
;B[rr];W[sp]C[SC: Black is dead with only 1 eye.  Black will probably now respond to the upper left corner invasion.  Including captured black stones, white has 3 more points in the lower right corner now than when the actual game played out.  Plus, white got to make the first move of a corner invasion.  Playing C17 before black plays a move to secure the corner changes the score by around 20 points.  Black loses about 15 points of corner territory and white gains about 5 when white makes a live group in the corner.

the point of all of this is to show that endgame moves worth 1-2 points should be saved until the actual endgame even if the look like sente.  Your opponent can always decide to not respond to your "Sente" move and accept the 1-2 point loss so he can play a move worth more points elsewhere.
Sente is a relative concept.  A move is only Sente if your opponent (not you) thinks that there is nothing more important elsewhere.]

(;B[rh]C[SC:This is a better way to cut white apart.  This is not necessarily going to work, but it has a better chance of working than R12 does.]
;W[qh]C[SC: If white plays here, he dies.  

White can still connect and live if he plays S13 here.];B[rg]
SQ[qi]C[SC: Black needs to extend here to gain liberties.  This also reduces white's liberties.  Now white's three stones have 2 liberties and black's two stones against the side have 3 liberties.  So, black is winning the capture race so far.

The marked black stone looks like it has only 2 liberties.  In reality, white can not prevent this stone connecting to the two stones at Q9-10.  So, we count all three of these stones as one group.]
;W[qf]C[SC: White tries to gain liberties, but is moving towards the black wall.]

;B[qm]C[White has reduce the top left corner but stil can't kill black's corner group.  The black stone at G15 will have to run out into the center, but should be able to do this easily.  In exchange, black has secured most of the right side.  The white stone at R13 will have a very hard time running out to safety.  It is OK to let your opponent take something small if you can take something else bigger at the same time.]
