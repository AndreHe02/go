(;W[fr];B[ep]C[very good - you played on your vital point - w missed his chance]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[gq]
(;B[eo]C[At this point I am just playing to contain White in his corner and have influence toward both sides and the center. So I make solid connections on all the cutting points. I feel like I haven't taken full advantage of White's failure to extend to the 6-3 point a few moves ago. How could I have played it better?

this move is not necessary - it is a (big) mistake, because you give up sente (you can connect anyway - d4/e5 are miai, and the cutting stone is caught anyway) - see variation)
so you can tenuki and strengthen your position on another side of the board. i am not sure what is the best, it depends on your style and feeling but there are a lot of big points on the board]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[ao];B[ec]C[this is good - you start making a huge left side]

What I really want to know is how I could have played the next part of the game to take proper advantage of my influence.

as i mentioned before: the target is the upper left group - especially now wiht the marked stones on the board]

(;W[le];B[pf]C[but w made the same mistake];W[mj]C[I lost on time here despite the 30-second byo-yomi because of some problem clicking my mouse (first and hopefully only time this happens!). But I counted up the captured and dead stones, then counted all the points of territory we each had, and I found that White is winning by 5 points here.

Clearly I failed to use my influence in the center and especially on the top side where I let White get a lot of territory. I also gave White a lot of territory in the bottom left corner where I was playing for containment and influence.

How could I have played this game better?

so jeff. let me make some concluding remarks:

you had good ideas for the strategy in the opening but then you missed the vital and attacking points (eg. left side and right side) you played too much in the center (w needed a lot of moves to get into this pointless area and you could have played in the meantim on the sides for attacking or getting some territory
the point is : you didn't get your opponent into troubles. he had time to consolidate his position and reduce your territory

also you played some useless stones for capturing already dead ones (improve your reading by trying to solve tesujis or life and death problems) and therefore you missed playing elsewhere

also you missed some more or less big endgame moves  (1 point here, 2 points there...)

so i hope that i could help you and use my hints for your next games

i wish you all the best and good luck,
best greetings, markus
