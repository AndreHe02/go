C[Hi Reviewer, i'm Jason playing black in this game. I had stopped playing GO for awhile now cause of work and study. So after a few games, i found i'm quite lost.

djna: Thank you for letting me see the game. I hope you will find my comments useful.

I have tried to identify a small number of things that you might consider in future.

My overall impression is that the margin of victory was not very great and in fact some more accurate play in early jose might have swung the game, however more important to long term success was  a fairly passive attitude and a failure to attack.

In quite a few places B protected or attacked one or two stones that could be sacrificed. Stones that matter are ones that cut the opponent or which make strength. When you see a couple of stones threatened ask yourself if they are important. For example consider the defensive move at 105. This was a time to accept the potential loss of two stones and a few points of territory and play somewhere much bigger.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[jc]LB[jd:A][je:C][ep:B]TR[de][pe]
[df][pf][dg][pg]C[

djna: generally, folks play A, the three star-point open tendes to work better, the reason being that B often stakes out a moyo along the marked points and then C is a nice erasure point, whereas the move at A leave less scope for ereasure.


Another alterntaive is to play B, stopping W building a framework.]
;W[fc]LB[cf:A]C[
djna: Usually thought to be bad, W is invading an area where there is restricted room for expansion.

Appraoching from the other side at A is  more normal.]
(;B[db]LB[cc:A][ec:C][cf:B]C[

djna: The idea of enclosing W is good, but this shape is a rather fuzzy, A and B are left for W to threaten later.

More usual is to say "Make W heavy, then attack.

So, C is quite a strong move  - see variation];W[fe];B[df]C[
djna: a reasonable result, but B is just a bit weaker than we'd like]
;W[ch]TR[cc][ce]C[

djna: argaubly on overplay by W.

We can see that B has weaknesses at the marked points and so W is putting a little pressure on B, but W is in danger of creating two weak groups.

This is a general pattern in teh game, W is very free in starting weak groups.]
;B[cg]CR[ff][eg][dh]TR[fc][fe]SQ[ch]C[

djna: This is understandble. B feels in danger of being undermined. But there are two problems:

1). severe weaknesses remain. The move chosen does not really work.

2). Its the wrong idea: We see two W groups we must separate them, then W has two things to worry about. if B maintains the connection to the centre he can build power that gets used later. 

If the idea here was to take some cheap territory and allow W to wall you in along the marked boundary then just say to yourself "No matter what I shall prefer the outside strength!

The strategic idea is that you will get territory on the right by attacking W's groups later.]

(;W[eh];B[mc]LB[jc:A][fe:B][ep:C]TR[qj][ip]C[


djna: Too small, too slow.

W has the chance to build a large framework as the marked points. 

B must think alonmg the lines of his A stone being no more viulnerable than W's B stone. Hence he does not need to defend.  If there were no big points left it's good, but there are.

I would play C as I see W growing a huge moyo over there as a serious danger.]
;W[ck]LB[ip:A][eq:B]C[

djna, slow, A or B];B[qj]LB[ip:A][iq:B]C[

djna:

The  meaning of this is that B claims to be growing faster than W. I'm not sure that this is true. W playing a A seems biger than this last move, hence I'd be trying to disrupt W by playting at B]
;W[qf]LB[ql:A][ip:B]C[

djna: greedy by W. He says "Oh! Black territory, can't allow that! Invade!"  Instead he should say "Puny B territory, I can make more!"


 I would play A or B];B[qe]C[

djna: Good move. B sees a chance to attack];W[of]LB[pf:A]C[

djna: this is slightly unusual, joseki is to play A.]
(;B[pm]LB[qj:A]TR[jc][mc][pd][qe]SQ[of][qf]C[

djna: I think this is  a missed opportunity

W has created a weak group, can we attack it?

I see a strong B group on the upper side and two W stones with no eyes and no space for two eyes, so although A is a bit of an isolated stone he is not under immediate pressure.]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[rn]LB[pg:A]C[

djna: Note that the peep of A still remains, W has an unstable group there. He has "debt", so even if he has more territory he has it by "borrowing".]
;B[jq]C[

djna: The right side feels a bit unfinished, but this is big]
;W[lq]C[

djna: Very important to note that W has lots of weakness in that corner.]

(;B[gp]C[
djna: I would play low, establish the base];W[eq];B[fq];W[er]
LB[ep:A]C[

djna: usually A is better]
(;B[fr]C[
djna:  B is getting pushed around];W[eo]LB[ce:C][bh:B][nq:A]
SQ[fc][fe][of][qf]C[At this point, i thought it isn't going well for me something was wrong but i jus can't figure out what.



djna: it's not as bad as it looks:

1). The bottom right is now ripe for invasion at A, so it's much smaller than it looks.

2). B is almost sente and fixes up the weakness at C as well as reducing the left

3). There are two marked W groups that could be attacked];B[qh]
SQ[pg][nq]C[

djna: but this seems very small. I'm not clear if it's a defensive move or is intended to to attack W.

I would start at the peep.

But I'd probably play the invasion at the bottom first];W[ip]
LB[em:B][gn:A][nq:C]C[

djna: this is a nice idea, in that leaning on a group to gain strength can be effective

I think W may be trying too hard now.

Suppose instead A, that moyo is growing!

This indicates that perhaps B should play A for his previous move, that will probably demand W solidify the left but a follow up at C by B is potentaiily quite big now.]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[hq]
(;W[jp];B[gn]C[

djna: it seems esential to get out here, otherwise W gets a very large moyo]

(;W[im]TR[hp][ip][jp]C[

djna: but this misses a chance, see variation

The 3 marked stone have no significance, patching left or right is much bigger]
;B[fl]LB[fm:A]C[

djna: maybe A is better, fewer weaknesses for W to aim at.]

C[this series of move helped white secure the side and i gained nothing. What should i heve done instead


djna: Either preempt the whole thing by playing A or B when instead you played  C or accept that that actually this outcome is not too bad

the marked stones are not safe. the invasion near B  is still possible

And B has three stones glaring into the centre. 

W has come out of this much worse than he should. He was always entitiles to quite a big left.]

(;B[ik]C[

djna, fundamental mistake in direction I think, bottom right is more important]
;W[il]C[

djna: W should patch up botom right];B[hk];W[el]C[

djna: W has bigger weaknesses.];B[rf]LB[kp:A][nq:B]C[

djna: it's an attacking move, and therefore good, and it patches up B's corner so it's big too.

I'd prefer to see how W deals with A or B];W[rg];B[qg];W[pf]
;B[re];W[rh]C[

djna: this whole sequence wass very bad by W, he's just made a heavy group and removed all B's weaknesses. As B I now think I'm winning!]
;B[ri];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[pj];W[ni]LB[fe:A][ni:C][il:B]C[

djna: B now has 3 targets, And so should have chances.];B[hd]
LB[fg:A][bh:B][nq:C]TR[fc][fe][eh]C[

djna: idea of attacking is good, but W has easy connection at A
if W plays that your move has little meaning.
I think I'd start a fight by playing A myself.. 

However, much more important are the two places where territiry swings can take place

I would play B, which both patches and threatens to isolate the marked stones

C is also huge];W[hb];B[ib];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[jb];W[jd]C[

djna: this turns out surprisingly badly for B]
(;B[kd]TR[hd][id]C[

djna: the important thing to spot is how weak the two marked stones are, and hence to devise an approach to look after them]
;W[je]
(;B[hf]LB[if:A]C[

djna: this fails, due to a ladder as a later variation shows,

It's quite hard to see, but it does seem like A does in fact work, but the level of reading required to be sure of that is very demanding, I'm not sure I would find that when playing.]

djna: this is the point where B really goes astray, see variation]
;W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[mf]C[

djna: B is taking a few extra points but letting W connect his groups.]
;W[mg];B[ne]C[

djna: B should be veryy keen to play elsewhere wuch as bottom right. B is caught up in completing the top.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[nf]LB[bh:A][nq:B]TR[ld][md][nd][le][me][ne][lf]
[mf]C[

djna: The three B stones are low value adding only 5 points. B should immediately switch to the bottom or left. These are as big and are forcing]
;B[md]TR[kc][le]C[

djna: very bad result, and W has sente. What's worse The cuts left behind mean that B didn't even secure the territory.]
;W[hg];B[hh]
(;W[gg]LB[ld:C][le:B][gg:A]TR[ne]C[

djna: neither A nor B is very big because neither is forcing.

W should be reinforcing the bottom.

Suppose W plays B and Black plays C now W must take so B has sente - he will allow W to have the marked stone too. A swing of only 7 points. Playing elsewhere must be worth more.]
;B[kc]C[i tot this is important

djna: Its worth a few points, but it's not strategically important - makes no difference to life and death of groups or future potential growth.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec]LB[ce:A][lp:B]C[

djna: very bad by W, he took one point and gave up sente. Much bigger to play A or B.]

djna: junction of two areas so quite big, but bottom right is huge.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[bg];B[bf];W[dg];B[cf];W[bh];B[gh]TR[gg][hg]C[

djna: gains a few points but is  not forcing, W can even give up the two marked stones, so there is no follow-up.

B must use sente more efficiently, bottom right is the area to play.]
;W[mo]LB[nq:A]C[

djna: the right idea. I'm not sure that the extinguishes all chnaces in bottom right.

W should count the score and decide how big he needs the bottom right to be. I suspect that A would be enough to win.]
;B[nn]LB[nq:C][qq:B][pr:A]C[

djna: this just concedes any remaining chance in the bottom right.

B must think like this: 

"Do I think I'm winning?"

YES: then play safe moves, like this one,  just reducing W a bit.

NO: then do something dramatic.
