C[CGA League 2009 - round 2
AlanT (9k) vs Melyandre (11k)


Hello, this was a good game.
The reason white lost this game was because he did not take care of his top group, and it could been saved for a long time.
Also white lost when he pushed from behind around move 80.
Around move 120 the game was over for white.];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd]

[nq:A]C[Reviewer:  Why not play A?

As the white B stone is on the third line I would play at A.
If the white B best was placed at the fourth line black would have C to attack the group later.]

This move is not often played, and I would thought about A,B,C.

A:  White will play light.
B: White will play heavy but settle his group fast.
C: This will become a fight, and can become hard for white as black is strong.]
