C[Hello. This is IgoAggie, KGS 3k. I hope I can help with this game. I was asked about how to deal with reductions and to explain a few things about how to make use of influence. It is quite difficult for many players to make good use of influence; so I hope that I can be of some help.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[dd];W[pd];B[jd]C[Although this move is fine for black, it would be a bit faster to approach one of white's stones. A knight's move approach is very common. At this point I would expect O17, R14, C6, or F3. But, again, K16 is an ok move, but perhaps not as speedy as an approach move.]
;W[qm];B[mq];W[rp];B[dj];W[qj];B[on]C[Right from the start, it is clear that black is choosing an influence-based game. The three stones in the upper left are all high (on the 4th line), and the corner was ignored in favor of influence. This approach is fine, but it can be hard for some player to take advantage of influence.]
;W[gq];B[jq]C[I think the lower side is less interesting. N3 has already settled this area for black. It would be much better to approach at C6 or O17.]
;W[pq]C[A big move.];B[oq];W[pr];B[or]C[I don't really like this move. I prefer R4. Put some pressure on w.]
;W[qp]C[W gets the good move. This secures the shape in the corner and puts pressure on B.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[qf]C[I think this approach comes from the wrong side. R10 acts as a pincer against this stone. So I think that approaching from the other side at O17 is better. This move is a bit cramped.]
;W[cc]C[I think this is a bad move. Black will make a strong wall with great influence, and white will live small in the corner. SInce both of the moves on the sides are high (k16 and d10), this 3-3 is great for black. No matteer which direction black chooses, this wall will be great for black.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg]
(;W[bg]C[Joseki here is to hane at d18 rather than to continue crawling on the second line like this. See variation.]
;B[bh];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]C[0];B[fc];W[cm]C[This is a nice move for w.]
;B[nc]C[This is also a nice move.This is one of the last huge moves of the opening. A double approach here is quite severe. It is also an extension from k16, which is great for B.]
;W[jc]C[This is a bit strange. Although it might live, it will give black excellent thickness facing the center.]
;B[ic]C[As a general rule, the best way to take advantage of thickness and influence is to use it for fighting. Black is starting a fight here but is choosing to push white away from the thickness. This is the wrong approach. If black wants to hane, l17 is a much better move. That way, w is being pushed toward black's strength. This move simply pushes white toward black's weakness. This is an important concept.]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[ld];W[mc];B[md]C[White is very cramped. White can still live, but it will be small life at the cost of great black influence.]
;W[nb];B[oc]C[a brutal move. White's corner is disappearing.]
;W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qc]C[The corner is gone.];W[qb];B[rb];W[ib]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[gb]C[White gets about 12 points on the top and black has an enormous, thick wall facing the center. This is a bad trade for white. This is why I said that k17 was a bad move. The hard part for some players is knowing how to make good use of a thick wall like this. The center is harder to control than the corners and sides.]
;W[qg];B[pg]C[A good move for black.];W[qh]
(;B[ol];W[ph]C[This hurts. I think ignoring the local situation was bad for black. This reduces a great deal. See variation.]
;B[og];W[oh];B[mh];W[hh]C[I was asked in the request to discuss how to handle reductions. I take it that things like this are the main issue. This is almost beyond "reduction" altogether. This is pretty much an invasion. It is deep behind enemy lines. White does not have any easy way to run to safety. So black should try to seal this in and kill it. There is so much thickness on every side that it should be a viable kill.]
;B[gk]C[A good start.];W[kh]
(;B[mi]C[I don't care for this move. It is solid but a bit slow. The attack should be more severe. See variation.]
;W[kj];B[ih]C[This violates an important attacking principle. Never attach to a weak stone or group. Attaching only makes the group stronger. This move helps white enormously.]
;W[ii]C[A good move.];B[ig];W[jh];B[hg]C[Still hard for white to live. White must run.]
;W[gh];B[gf]C[I would not play here. I would seal white in with a move like L8]
;W[kf]C[Wrong direction. White should go the other way where this is lots of open space. This is running toward black's strength.]
;B[ij]C[This move steals some eye potential from white.];W[hj]
;B[ik];W[jj]C[False eyes everywhere.];B[gj];W[gi]C[White makes a false eye. This just gives a free move to black. Time to seal white in!]
;B[kl]C[Excellent move. White is in real trouble now.];W[jf]
C[Bambo joints like this are good shape usually, but this is not of much use here. There is not enough room for an eye yet. Black can rob white of this eye.]
;B[jg]C[Gone.];W[kg];B[eh];W[gg];B[hf];W[ie]C[White is hopeless so far.]
;B[he]C[Not really necessary for b.];W[id];B[hd];W[mf];B[oe]
;W[mg]C[This bamboo joint is better. There is real eye potential for white now.]
;B[ng];W[nh]C[Uh oh. Black has some weak stones. White may escape now.]
;B[nj];W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[nk];W[ml]C[Black managed to connect but at the cost of white snaking away. But white still has nowhere to run; so this should be ok.]

(;B[mm];W[nl]C[Trouble for black. Black cannot afford to lose those four stones and let white live.]

(;B[nm]C[This is not going to work. See variation.];W[ok]C[Disaster! Black is doomed now. White lives and black has little territory. An easy game for white. See the variation for how this could have been avoided.]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[pj]C[The fight is over. White won (somewhat unjustly). Black let white off too easily. The game is tough for black now.]
;B[lj]C[Not going to work.];W[kk];B[jk];W[li];B[ho]C[A bit of compensation, but not much.]

(;B[gm]C[White is decently ahead at this point. Black needs to try something. A 3-3 might not work in the bottom left but it's worth a try. Black has nothing to lose. See variation.]
