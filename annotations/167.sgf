C[Hi reviwer:
     I do not really understand why I lost the game.
So, I hope u can help me. Thanks very much

My opinion about the
Move 13: I think put my black stone in Q15 instead of R8 is much better becasue to give the white stones in the upper coner is more important than get some space.
Move 17: I think it is waste my move.
Move 49: I think put my black stone in G3 instead of G4 is much better.


Review by John Rae.    JR: I hope the review helps you. Please remember that there are many players  stronger than me. They might make different comments]

(;B[nq]C[
JR:  O3 does not  secure the corner. If you were intending to take the corner  it would have been more consistent to start with R4 instead of Q4.

Starting with 2 stones on 4-4 points would imply a strategy aiming towards getting broad influence quickly. Moves at K4 or K3 might follow this strategy.

On the other hand white has two stones on 3-4 points. His idea is to develop solidly in the corners.

Since Black's stones on 4-4 can wait for white to approach, black could choose to  hinder white's solid development by approaching one of the corners.

Options might be D15, C15 or the equivalent in the top right.]
;W[ce]C[ White follows his strategy of securing a corner.

Now if black approaches the top right a white pincer move is also an extension from the stones in the top left.]
;B[cn];W[oc]
(;B[qn]LB[qq:a]C[Black's stones are too close together

The 3 stones do not secure the corner since an invasion at A  might be possible later.

The alternatives would influence a larger area of the board. This creates the potential for more in the future.]
;W[qk]
(;B[qg]LB[jc:a][di:b][jp:c]C[ two ideas to think about  here

1) might black play elsewhere, a,b or c perhaps

2) if black plays on the right side which is the best place?]
;W[qi]
(;B[ql]LB[jp:a][cj:b]C[I think put my black stone in Q15 instead of R8 is much better becasue to give the white stones in the upper coner is more important than get some space.

JR: To play against a stone is usually a defensive not an attacking move.   The outline reason is that White can play at Q8 or S8 Since the black stone has fewer liberties than the white ones the black stone can be thought to be under more attack

>From your question you seem to feel R8 gains territory - but it doesn't really do much. If you are happy to leave the top stone by itself  a play on the left or bottom achieves more.]
;W[ok];B[og];W[ni];B[mg]C[Move 17: I think it is waste my move.

JR: No I think you have to keep running at this stage   If Black does not  White might play on N13 which could leave the 2 stones in difficulties]
;W[ne]
(;B[le]LB[li:c][jg:a][jp:b][kh:c]C[ White's next move continues to gain territory while keeping black under pressure.

I think better choices are

a) keep running to be very safe

b) develop elsewhere

c) try to put pressure on the white group below, although this can lead to a messy fight]
;W[lc]
(;B[re]C[JR: This forces White to strengthen his corner - which he wanted to do at some time anyway

The alternative gets the Black stones out and at the same time puts pressure on White's group below]

 A simple development on the side would be better.];W[hc];B[fe]
;W[jd]C[JR: notice how White developes the top but at the same time puts black stones on the side under a little pressure]
;B[gb];W[hb]
(;B[gc]C[JR: This move is wasted.

a) Its an empty triangle, often a bad move

b)  White gets a free move to continue the attack.

c)  It leaves 4 stones vulnerable to white attack later in the game]
;W[dg]
(;B[ch]C[The important thing here is that Black has 2 potentially vulnerable groups. White aims to attack tham while gaining profit at the same time.

I think the black stones at the top have to find safety first.   I  am not sure how best to do this. I think i would try and connect the 2 weak groups but ....]

Move 49: I think put my black stone in G3 instead of G4 is much better.

(;B[io]C[JR:

Reasons why I like your move

1) It shuts White in
2) It threatens to expand territory on the bottom right

Reasons I do not like it

1) White can still invade at 3-3. This reduces your territory at the bottom
2) The White group on the right can easily expand into the middle minimising any territory gain there
3) Black's stones at the top are very weak
4) Black's stones on the right are not safe

I think you have to do something about your weak stones];W[pl]

Blacks difficulties started as white made pincer attacks to stones on the side and top. More stones were played but left in danger as the game moved elsewhare. Later white was able to attack both groups at once.

It is important to be able to play between an opponents stones but remember that the most important thing is to make these groups safe (or gain compensations elsewhere if they have to die)

Think about

1) making live groups
2) connecting groups
3) trying to find moves which have two purposes])
