A game I won but treat as a loss because of the mistakes I made, hence the submission to GTL.
Thank you for your review, I look forward to reading it.

TJ: I will do my best to help you!];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]
;W[cf]
(;B[fd]C[TJ: I might prefer a pincer here. This move is sound but is also the fourth one you've played in the same part of the board, which could lead to over-concentration.]
;W[bd];B[pj]C[preferred this to C17....better at R10?

TJ: C17 is extremely large, because it is big for both sides. Learning to identify such mutually big moves is a big step forward. If white gets it, then she not only gets five points in the corner but many follow-ups (e.g., e18) to add to her territory there and to decrese black's; if black gets it, then white will need to play c11 to prevent black starting a profitable attack on that group.

All that said, Q10 is also very big and I can't criticise it. R10 is not so good - with the star points you need to play high, for influence, and so moves like R10 are out of harmony with that idea. After black R10,  white might very soon play P10 and squash you down flat.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[I think better here is to play p17 and to start and attack on o17 using the K16 stone. White lives easily now.]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[better M17?

TJ: M17 and R17 are "miai" - that is, if black takes one, white can have the other.]
;W[lc]C[TJJ: White is alive. This position is much better for white now because black's stones are all huddled together while white is making her presence felt over the whole board. Moroever, for all the over-concentration of black's stones, black still has not gained any territory - the top is open at the sides and at H16, while Q12 would put paid to any territorial hopes at the right side.]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[qb];B[rb]C[greedy or correct??

TJ: I think this is correct shape, but on the other hand there are bigger points that could be taken. P4 is a big approach, C17 is very large, a play around k3 would be very big (putting a wedge into white's formation). R18 is a big move, but not as big as the other ones available.]
;W[kp]C[TJ: I'd play M18 here. A black placement at this point would be very unpleasant.]

(;B[ck]C[seemed time for an invasion

TJ: I would play M18 here. It does not kill outright, but it does prevent white from making two eyes, thereby leaving her with a very weak group to worry about (and your stones on the fourth line are well-placed to assist the attack).]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[qh];B[oh]C[cap seemed better than squeezing base space

TJ: This is the correct principle: Take away space first by surrounding, then the vital points. By surrounding the other player, you make her live small and then get profit elsewhere on the board. Very often the aim of attacking is NOT to kill outright, but to use the threat of killing to build up profit elsewhere.]
;W[hp];B[ch];W[ef];B[gf]C[seemed better than E12];W[bg];B[bh]
;W[oq];B[rd]C[suddenly looked to me that W could create mischief by playing at S16 in conjunction with R12]
;W[cm];B[bl]C[E12 better?];W[eh];B[di]C[too defensive??];W[bm]
;B[ql];W[db];B[eb];W[df];B[le]C[seemed good to cap and seal W in

TJ: That's the right idea. If you can seal white in, then M18 begins to look very dangerous.]
;W[ld];B[me];W[ah];B[ai];W[ca];B[ag]C[better G12 or somesuch?]
;W[af];B[cg]C[on reflection I should be playing something like G12 or L10 instead??]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[je];B[ie];W[kg];B[jg]C[TJ: Nice slapping tesuji, but now the placement at M18 looks very tempting indeed.]

(;B[ja]C[looked like W could just crawl through otherwise...but wrong time of game to play this probably?

TJ: Black can simply kill white here];W[qk]
(;B[pl]C[TJ: This is very bad. It's an empty triangle, which is horrible shape. If you're ever tempted to make an empty triangle, then look again. 99 times out of 100 you will find a better alternative.]
