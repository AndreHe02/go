C[[Agi\] Hello, I'm Agilis of KGS, roughly 10k on the old kgs2 ranking system. I'll be your reviewer for this game. I'll preface all my comments with a tag to differentiate my comments from others.

~~~

This is a game against a 16k on IGS.
I put some thinking in the file when I reviewed it myself but I would like someone to have a look to see if I m right or not.

I think the big points are at: 12, 21, 33, 43, 47, 60, 87, 91, 101, 140, 147, 203, 228

But feel free to make any comment.

I m especially interested in comments on the opening since I ve studied it recently :-) I think it went wrong here...

If you have any idea on thinks I should study more, I m interested...

Thanks very much.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[op];B[pn];W[lq]LB[oq:B]
[pq:A]C[[Agi\] This is most likely not a joseki move. Most likely it's a special purpose professional move, since it is locally it is a loss for white. Black A or B  is a perfectly natural and profitable follow up.]

(;B[fp]TR[lq]C[[Agi\] With the marked white stone, the bottom is not particularly large for either side, playing on the 4th line here just creates weaknesses]

(;W[ce]C[I think white made a mistake here...

[Agi\] Possibly. It's true black gets a 'good' extension, but it's not without its problems, see later.]

Was the variation better?

[Agi\] You've built a big wall in exchange for giving away most of the bottom, and then you play away without using it. See variation]
;W[ep]C[[Agi\] And instead, the tables are turned, and black is under severe attack now]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[eo]C[[Agi\] and on top of that, black actively encourages white to kill the corner.]

Variation is any better?

[Agi\] the question is, what is 33 trying to do? it doesn't help the marked group, but the semi-settled black group along the side. If you were going to sacrifice the marked stones, it should have been done much earlier.]

White didn't take the kill right now but really later.

It was cutting white in two, really important group I think.]
;B[pi];W[oh];B[ph];W[lc]TR[nf]C[[Agi\] A good move by white. With the new strong stones in the area, attacking k17 is good.]

C[[Agi\] Black just built a big wall, lettign white walk on the 4th line, the so-called "line of victory"

Moreover, the white group at A, is unconditionally alive. What is black going to attack to put the wall to good use?]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[gf];B[hg]C[[Agi\] Worse, the wall has now come under attack and is a burden.]

(;B[hf];W[ge];B[ii];W[ji];B[ih];W[jh]C[[Agi\] After this move, the black center group has no chance of connecting.]

(;B[jg]C[[Agi\] Playing patterns by rote, such as here,  will only get you killed someday.]
;W[lh];B[kg];W[oe];B[pe];W[dk]TR[gn]C[[Agi\] quite surprising no one has played at the marked point yet. It's undeniably the largest point on the board, even Q15  wasn't big enough really.]

(;W[qr]C[[Agi\] Unnecessary.];B[cc]C[Tried to invade but I don't think it is possible without a mistake of white.

[Agi\] It's not.];W[dc];B[cd];W[be];B[db];W[eb];B[bd];W[cb]

;B[lf];W[ck];B[sk];W[sl];B[sj];W[lo];B[nd];W[ne];B[of];W[ng]
;B[pf]C[[Agi\]

Even if the center group hadn't died, black was far far far behind. Everything that Black has all of. 24 points on the board, 26 if the group lived, most of them small eye spaces.

Overall, white didn't have to do very much this game, because black would give away huge amounts of territory, such as the top, or bottom,  and get nothing in exchange but a wall that's never utilized.

Black's greatest problem is having a poor sense of what stones are worth saving, and what stones are better off being sacrificed.

I hope I've been helpful, if you have further questions I'm available on KGS as Agilis, or AgiNyan, or via email at agi.projectmail@gmail.com]
