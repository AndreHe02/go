C[[I (black) played this against a computer. I feel like things started to distintegrate around 16, and am wondering what I should have done to prevent it or to recover. did this loss come out of the clear mistakes I have noticed in the middlegame, or was my opening fundemantally flawed?\]
REV: Hi alexis, I앐 Jorge, jorgeant 13k* in igs, and i will try to do my best, but perhaps my best in a 9x9 game is not best at all ;-)]
;B[gc];W[cf];B[fg];W[cc];B[dg]C[[too aggressive considering white could cut at F5 or G5?\]
REV: I don앖 think so, here you can be conservative like playing H4 to secure the whole area or agresive like with your movement or with D6 (probably what i would play), i don앖 think an invasion in the center would be a problem if you become secure up and down, in a 9x9 board the center is very narrow, but anyway, the question of influence versus territory and attacking versus defending will lie with the go player for ever]
;W[cg];B[ch]C[REV: aich!, C2 is a very narrow play, even this board is big, E5 is THE move, do you remember the subjects of my previous comment? E5 is everything at the same time!]
;W[bh];B[di];W[ec]C[REV: that really hurts!];B[fb]C[REV: I said that the center in a 9x9 board is narrow for an invasion, but not for you to keep territory, would be better F5]
;W[eb];B[ee]C[[i was afraid this game would stabilize into left vs. right territory, so i wanted to get a bigger piece of the center. but E5 and G7 aren't connected, and i think this led to trouble. would F5 have been more prudent?\]
REV: Of course, your move is now too greddy and left a big defect back, as you said, F5 was THE move]
;W[fd]C[REV: is you have any religion, its time to pray ;-)]
;B[ge]C[REV: at this time IMHO the game is over, i use to resign very quickly because to die slowly or to wait a mistake in my opponent don앖 make me happy, but anyway, let go! ... your move only brings more defects, here you have a true problem and you must recognice it, not trying to do the imposible, so here would be better a sluggish G6, in this game it give you a "decent" defeat, but not trying to do the imposible is a good advice in any situation]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[fe];B[fc]C[[should I have played F4 instead? I was worried how flimsy my wall looked, and that if he played F7 I'd need to play H8 and lose a point of territory. also it seemed like F3 was loosely connected to E5 and G5.\]
REV: Well, first of all, F7 form what is called an "empty L" and believe me (and ask anybody), it is almost imposible to do a good movement if it makes an empty L, in relation with your comments, the problem is not one point in H8, the problem is to recognize the situation, the entire center-up territory is in mortal danger, G4 was THE move]
;W[ed];B[ef]C[[to prevent an atari on E5 and connect.\]
REV: see previous comment];W[gf];B[he];W[ff];B[hf];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[if]C[[a mess, but I'm thinking it's not so bad since I still keep the corners and hasn't made any territory.\]
REV: mmm, if i were white a will play H8, it don앖 loose anything and it would bring some "interesting" ko압]
;W[ag]C[REV: but being conservative when you are wining its also a good way of playing]
;B[bi];W[fh]
(;B[fi]C[[a blunder. i didn't see the atari on F3. Would E3 have saved the corner through the variation?\]
REV: I agree with your variation of E3, and don앖 worry, even dan압 do blunders]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B[ih]C[[wanted to be sure the lower side would have two eyes. playing at G1 wouldn't have made that possible, but I thought this move retained the option of me playing G1 later.\]
REV: mmm, I앐 sorry but the lower group is imposible to have two eyes whatever it play, it has an true eye and a lot of FALSE eyes, its very helpfull to study life and death problems, but this is something that even very much better players should do]
;W[ah];B[gi];W[fa]
(;B[ga]C[[didn't see the cut at H7 coming. should I have played H8 instead? or J7? confused...\]
REV: the key point is H8, with J7 you are dead, but see your Var 3]
;W[hc];B[gb]C[[didn't see this group was unsavable now..\]
REV: yes, it압 dead, so why keep playing there?, let that for ko압 or whatever]
;W[hb];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[ea];W[ha];B[db];W[dd]C[REV: well, nobody is born with a dan level go, don앖 worry, the only advice i can give you is to left both 9x9 board and computer go, a 9x9 board is good for learning the rules and primary concepts, but the true go is strategy and here you can become narrow minded in tactical facts, the same narrow minded that happen playing against only one player, and if this one is a narrow minded computer your style would be spoiled, so my main advice is playing 19x19 with real players (and if it압 on internet WITHOUT duplicate board), good bye and luck!]
