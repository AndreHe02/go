RE[W+7.5]

C[To reviewer-> thank you very much for what you're doing.  This is a very noble system for players helping players, and reviewers like you are what make it work!

Now i dont' feel this game was played anywhere near my best, but i wanted to send a loss to GTL.

This gamed was played on igs, me as black.  I planed on experimenting a little but i feel after the fuseki this should have been an easy win for white (i should never have made the score so close.)

Now I wont say what I think you should comment on, if i knew I wouldnt need the comments!  So anywhere you can see an ability to improve is what I'm looking for.

I am an on-again off-again player.  Last ranked by AGA about 6 years ago at 5 kyu. I feel that I am about the same ranking, as when I goto the local club, they all say I am about 4 kyu.

Normally, when I do a review, I don't use variations.  I tend to use lables, such as A, B, C and D.  However, since the player used several variations, I will attempt to use them during my review.

My comments will begin with an "RR:"


RR:  Post Review Comments-
After reviewing the game, there is one comment I can make.  Learn how to use power to your advantage to start fights, and create territory.  The Chinese opening is great for that.]
;B[pd]C[*baystar*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.];W[dd]
;B[qp];W[cq];B[pk]C[This is a fuseki I'm currently messing with... over the last few days I've noticed some if it's weak spots and am straying away from it.

It's main advantage was speed of devlopment when the player blindly approaches the lower corner from the outside (contrary to how it 'looks' with that inward 3-4 point :0)

RR:  Have you looked at the Chinese opening?  There is a book dedicated to it, and this is very similar.  The opening looks like it should be invaded, but when it is, your opponent is pushed into area where you are strong.  I think that is what you are saying above.]
;W[op]C[RR:  White should develop the corner in the bottom left first.  In my 5 kyu opinion, that is the best way to play against an opening like this.  Since white has 5.5 points komi, developing white's corner is just as important as playing in blacks area.]
;B[pn]TR[mp]C[RR:  Instead of making territory on the left side, try a pincer move as indicated by the triangle.  This will force white to play up in the area where a black stone is, and black will be stronger.]
;W[qq];B[pp]TR[pq]C[RR:  It is obvious where white will play next, the marked location.  This is a bad shape for black to be in.  Maybe a hane underneath or simply pull back.]
;W[pq];B[oo]C[RR:  I don't know joseki, so this is just an opinion.
I think that white is in a better position here.  White's three stones appear to be doing as much as blacks five stones.]
;W[np]C[and now the weakness is easier seen, as white s4 is now big (ahem: HUGE) yose sente.

RR:  Yes, I added Variation #3 on the next move (Var 2 -> var 3)]
;B[dp]TR[rq]C[in retrospect, I'm not too comfortable with this move, but my original thinking was to gain control of the center over there, as that 3-3 opening is fairly low.

At the time I didnt mind white chosing the direction because i considered if there was no 3-3 stoned there and white had played this as an invasion, it would seem premature. I did neglect one important point though- this situation is different than a san-san invasion as it's white's move now :0)

Again, this was more experimental than trying to be slick

RR:  This is one of those moves that I don't have a reply for.  There is nothing wrong with it, except that it doesn't really work with any other stones.  There are 2 stones on the right side which are also on the 4th line, but they seem far away.  Good attempt at abeing "slick!"  I might have tried to finish the corner by playing S3 before jumping elsewhere.  (Although I don't know that S3 is sente, so black's move might be the right one!)]

(;W[cp];B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[er]C[RR:  See my variation.  My thoughts are that black's original thought was to take control of the center, but then jumped at the first opportunity to goto the 3rd line.  Instead, keep white pressed down.]

(;B[cn];W[ci];B[dq];W[dr]C[RR:  This was a bad exchange for black.  White is now connected, and black doesn't gain anything.]
;B[dj]C[RR:  My first thought was that this should be on the 3rd line.  But then I thought about it, and it works with black's intent of controlling the center.]
;W[di];B[ej];W[cj];B[ck];W[cf]TR[fd]C[RR:  This move is bad by white.  The corner is still open.  White should extend along the top, and invite black to invade.]
;B[jq]C[RR:  I don't understand this move.  If Black wants to reduce moyo, then play on the 4th line here.  If black is looking for territory, then play somewhere on the top, it is still wide open.
Without looking ahead, I am worried that white will be able to attack this stone, and get into the center.]
;W[lq];B[gp]TR[fq][jo]C[RR:  This move is aimless.  If black wants to block white's march into the center, then play F3.  If black wants to make a big moyo, then play up, at k5.  The move that was played did neither.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jp];B[jo];W[kp]TR[jq]C[Now i considered that exhange bad for black as white devloped both the upper left and lower sides, but my center  influence isn't terrible.  Black still has a hard fight ahead.

Sente to approach the upper left seemed urgent at this point, so i leave the fight now.  I belive there is some aji @ g2.

RR:  Yes, this was bad for black.  I think that the original K3 move was in the wrong spot.  
At this point, I think that white is far ahead.  Black has some influence, but it has holes.  White has territory all over the board, while black only has a little bit on the right side.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fd]C[RR:  Black had some questions about white's next move.  Please see my variation.]

(;W[nc]C[was this a good idea by white?  I think this makes  building a base to easy for the black pillar @ f17, when i play the dual purpose move @ L17

RR:  If I was white, I would have played at E18. (see variation on previous move)]
;B[kc]TR[jc]C[RR:  This stone is 1 line too far away from the two black stones.  The rule of thumb is 2 stone -> 3 lines away.  The white stone will still be pressured, but the black position will be stronger.]
;W[ne];B[qf]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[is 'A' better?  I played 'B' for balence

RR:  A is better for attack.  Played stone is better for territory.  Since territory is hard to get in the corner in this position (o 17 is on the 3rd line), I would have played at A.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[ph]TR[rb]C[RR:  Black should try to share the corner by playing at s18.  This leaves white eyeless.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[rb]C[Black feels something has gone terribly wrong as all four corners belong to white :0)

RR:  If black's goal was center influence, black should be happy that white got all 4 corners. :).
Again, if you are going to go for influence, then you need to learn how to turn power into territory (not an easy thing to do!)  
Plus now, white's group is settled, and black is over concentrated on the right side.]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[lc];W[nb];B[kf]C[after this move I think there is a chance of making up my losses

RR:  Just think how happy black would be if white had no eyes on the top right :-).]
;W[le];B[ke];W[fh];B[cc]C[Could this move have been used better? After re-examining the result, it seems like a wasted move

RR:  I looked (see the several variations) and found some ways that black can live.  The key is the 2nd move.]
;W[eb]
(;B[be];W[cd]
(;B[ed];W[bc];B[fb];W[cb]C[this seems like an overplay by white, black cannot play b-e19, wd19, b-d18, white f19, b-d17 (self atari)

RR:  White probably feels ahead, and is playing it safe.];B[de]
;W[ce];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff];W[eh];B[fg];W[dg];B[ig]TR[gh]C[RR:  To mark off territory, think bigger.  Block white on the left.  by playing the played move, black is limiting the amount of territory by fencing in this edge of territory.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[hj];B[no];W[ko];B[jn];W[hk];B[gm]
TR[hl]C[too timid?

RR:  Yes.  Hane at the head of the stones.

The last few moves hve shown me that black is using the outside influence to directly make territory.  I see black marking off walls, and that is not the way to use ouside influence.  The correct way is to force your opponent into your powerful areas, and then benefit with the fight.  White plays very safe, not jumping out too far, and always connected to its base.  So that is a very hard stratagy to counter with blacks outside influence.]

C[this was a horrible move

better at 'a' or maybe l6? m6?

RR:  Yes, I played around with some variations, and did not see a good followup.  If you want to play this move, maybe start it with S5 first.  If ignored, then your move at N4 becomes very powerful]
;W[mo]
(;B[mn];W[lo];B[mk]TR[ro][bl]C[BIG, but maybe playing at s5 first is better

RR:  Yeah, but there are bigger moves on the board.  S5 is one of them.  B8 is is a huge move also.]
;W[kk];B[mi];W[sn]C[I really would like to know the proper way of dealing with this... I took the dangerous route :0)   As i said, this was a game where I felt like experimenting

RR:  to experiment, here is a sequence for a KO.]
(;B[ro];W[so];B[rq];W[sp];B[rr];W[oq];B[rn]TR[rm]C[RR:  Bad shape.  Jump out one more to S7.  Unfortunatly, white will be able to push almost the whole side.  Or maybe jump out 2 lines.  That could contain.]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[rl];B[rk]C[RR:  One piece of advice.  When trying to contain a "leak" like white has, back off a line and do not touch white's stones.]
;W[ql];B[qk]TR[pl]C[looking ugly for black :0)  game ender, luckily I got a picnic ko out of it

RR:  The marked spot would help contain the white leak.];W[pm]
