AB[dp][pd]C[andreasv [18k\]: hi
In this game i thought i was always in with a chance, and was mildly surprised when i lost. Perhaps i was not forceful enough and let things drift by playing conservatively or safe. My comments have noted wasted moves by me ( Black ) and perhaps if i had used these moves constructively it would have made a difference.
I THOUGHT that i had played OK..but then reality dawned as we counted up :-(
I would welcome comments on my approach and strategy as well as comments on my technicakl inadequacies.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review this

(;B[cc]C[i considered K16 instead but felt that i needed to protect my corner]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[be];B[bb]C[Very unsure of this..again i wanted to play k15 or k16]
;W[ac];B[nq]C[As i had 2 stones advantage, perhaps i should try and take the initiative

kk> agree, should utilise the two stone in the hoshi, take initiative and aim for "influence" play

kk>play on this corner up to here all is small point moves, i think should move fast to reap or establish "boundaries" - big point move, before narrow down to small point move. Up to now, the entire big picture is still lot of good and more "return" point to be play.]
;W[oq]
(;B[lp];W[qn];B[np]C[I was thinking of trying to build a wall to protect lower side BUT would an extension from Q16 have been better?

kk> personally I think now already in the fuseki phase (opening phase), go for big move or big point location is much better than fighting for the small point. I think both C10 or R10 look fine for me.

kk> this move for me look like unnnecary, waste of resources move, what you want to achieve. Better throw the stone elsewhere you can have better gain. Remember, this is game of surrounding for better gain then your competitor. You need to take a gain for each move, or can reduce the gain from your competitior.]

(;B[lm]C[very unsure of this.. i was tempted by k10 instead but then that seems to leave a stone lost in the wilderness, and will i ever be able to connect it back home? K10 does however sketch out an upper quadrant framework, one full of LOTS of holes. M7 was aimed at creeping out.

But would i have been better to try and secure upper side, H15/N15/N16/R13 or even protect the vcorner with say R17?

I am often faced with this type of position and am unsure..views please]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[fn]C[comments as previous, especially as i have just suffered a c3 invasion. The idea of f6 was to try and ensure that i could creep out into ' enemy space']

;W[eg];B[im];W[ff];B[fe]C[Pointless! Gains me 1 point..there must be something bigger
F8 perhaps..which makes another point. I always extend with 1 space extensions or position opposite a  1 point extension, , eg say G10 here. Perhaps i should use a knights move like o8 more frequently]
;W[ge]
(;B[ec]C[probably not necessary but i have been caught so many times with Death situations that this was a 'guarantee' survival move. I could read it out but that would take an awful long time..and i did look at the variation and took a safety first route]

If white choose to escape, chase it (indirectly build up the influence or surrounding territory).]
