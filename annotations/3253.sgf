;B[rg];W[qk]C[Now black got sente and a strong shape.];B[dj]
;W[jd]LB[nc:A]C[This move doesn't work well with A. If black invades and separates white, both sides will be heavy.]

;B[gc];W[ic];B[ge]LB[lc:C][ce:A][me:B]C[This is pretty small, since the corner is still open. A is bigger here, however, you might want to play B first to threaten C.]
;W[me];B[mh]LB[ce:A]C[I don't think that this is very big, or necessary - black should instead secure the upper left corner now with A. If black doesn't play here, white can't really shut him in, and even if he does, he can't gain anything by doing so.]

LB[hp:C][lp:B][qq:A]C[I think black should play the invasion at A instead. Because of the gaps at B and C, the territory isn't secure anyway, so making white stronger doesn't really matter that much.]

;W[ln];B[nm];W[kq];B[jq]LB[hp:B][jq:A]C[This is a horrible exchange for white - white loses the chance to play at A, and B becomes a lot more difficult.]
