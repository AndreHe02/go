C[# Hallo Michael, 

my name is Erwin.  I'll be doing the review for White (and also some comments for Black) as requested.  Please use my e-mail to ask any additional questions you may have!

# Asking for a review is a good way to become stronger.];B[dp]
;W[pd]
(;B[ed]LB[ed:3][dp:2][pd:1]C[# In general Joseki are very complex. Weaker player do better by  playing  almost everytime 'hoschi' at 'A', so one can prevent for getting confused.

1, 2, 3 is unusual.
For common play, see Variation!

Hoshi is for Beginners the most important Joseki-move!
- Handicapstones are on Hoshi 
- Hoshi can hardly be sealed in and be caught.];W[dd]LB[pp:A]
C[I'm not sure if this is technically a good move, but it
worked out for me in the end, probably because of mutual
incompetence.

# Better to take the the unobsessed corner with 'A'];B[pp];W[de]
C[Too small?

# That is also professional playing! Go is very complex, and one move is not just 'small' or 'big',  you must consider at least two (better three) own stones, as well as the arangement of the opponent.]

minutes thinking about what harm it could do me before
making the move. It's a very small move I think.

Q9, looking at the posibility of reducing Black's framework
there. Would such a plan be workable, or just way too
big?

# Triangled stone is very weak

Instead, I decided to jump out and surround the Black upper right.

than the top middle?
