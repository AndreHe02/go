Hello, 

You played a good game and W did a lot of mistakes indeed.
I hope the comment will help you.

Hi reviewer,



I was playing black in the game. White had the initiative most of the time, and there is a saying that the person with the initiative usually wins, but I didn't feel/know I had won until the late endgame. I had made several mistakes, but no matter how many times I looked through the game I couldn't pinpoint white's! Please help me figure out why I won and point out anything I can improve on. Pointing out white's mistakes would be good too, so I can learn from them. :D]

I disagree. This move is terrible for W.];B[do];W[cq];B[cp]
