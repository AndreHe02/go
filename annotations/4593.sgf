Review by DonPimpon.

Final comments in the last move.
*************************************************************
Thanks in advance for your review.

I have been playing for 4 months, the first one against computer (igowin and gnugo), then i started playing on kgs.

I read a couple of time "The second book of go" and "Lessons in the fundamentals"; now I'm reading the first four volumes of elementary go series.

Usually I study some Life and Death problems and I'm starting to study the first tesuji problems from book 3 of elementary go series.

In this game I am W; in the ending B made a big mistake, otherwise he could have won by few points. I can recognize  Black's mistakes, but very few of mine: this is the reason for asking this review.

This is the first review I ask, please help me to spot bad and good moves so to understand where to focalize my studies.]

This move is wrong unless you have a white stone in A.

Fortunately, black didn't play the best sequence (see variation).]

;B[pl];W[ph];B[gd];W[fc];B[gc];W[kc]LB[kd:A]C[Is this an appropriate extension?

I left room for B to make a short extension (e.g. j17 or k17) so to not invite an invasion in the upper right corner.

What about this?

**********************************************

It's not bad, and it's the good direction. I would try at A better.
The proverb says: "play 3rd line for territory, play 4th line for influence".

My personal style is more focused in the use of influence, but it's a concept a bit hard to digest being 14k. Your move is good but allows black to exchange your points on the top for a massive influence in the center. See continuation.]
;B[jd];W[kd]
(;B[je];W[kf];B[jc]C[I think it's a big mistake for B leaving me ahead in the center

*******************************************

I agree. K17 it's a big mistake. It's like playing tenuki (not playing a move). He gave you sente (initiative) for free.]
;W[ok];B[gh]LB[qc:A]C[Too shy.

It's better to directly play A.];W[ig];B[if];W[jf];B[hf];W[ih]
;B[dj];W[hj]LB[jg:A]C[L12 is a honte move, but I preferred to extend my moyo.
Is this a mistake?

***********************************************

In this situation L12 is NOT a honte move, because if black wants to cut in A, it will get trapped in the geta (net) made by you playing L12 then.

Playing L12 instead of H10 is even worse than black's mistake before.]
;B[gj];W[hk]C[after my review i think O7 is probably better because attacks the stone at q8 extending my moyo.

**********************************

No. The move you did is the correct one or you will lose the center. You need to wait to have sente to continue in O7]

As you can see in all the variations, this empty triangle is VERY BAD and should be avoided no matter what.

Empty triangles are 99.999% of the time bad, so try to look for an alternative, because there is ALWAYS a better move.]

The biggest move here is to protect at B. 
You can think that it is a coward move, but it worths more than 20 points. I can't understand why black didn't invade there before.

Another option is playing at A. See continuation.];B[gi];W[cm]

********************************************

When I started playing Go, I used to play like this, looking for a mistake from the opponent. 

It took me a long time, but I finally stopped doing it, because it's irrespectful and the opponent can get angry with you, considering it an insult.

One should know when there is potential (aji) and when to stop.

If you think that there is potential, continue playing, if you look for a mistake because you already lost, please resign like a gentleman.]

***************************************************

You play very well for your level and I think you will progress fairly quick. You have a good sense of direction and quite good technique.

On the other hand, you have some shape problems like empty triangles and how to close a border that you need to solve. You lack a bit of strategy: as you can see now, black has its points in a well defined area and frankly, you were quite lucky to win.

I have faith in you. I think you will improve very fast. Read, and read again "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" as it's a fantastic book. Every time you read it, it will give you a new view of this wonderful game.

Watch out from those empty triangles and good luck!!!

Black clearly wants the center in exchange for the nice points you got on the top.

The marked stones look very weak now in front of your Great Wall.

A movement around A will always be good for you, as it will make you territory because black needs to make his group live first. You can approach black's group a bit further, but he could retaliate and it's a bit dangerous.]
