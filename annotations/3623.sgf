AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp];W[nq]C[Dear reviewer :)
I was black player, so I'm particulary interested on B play.
I reviewed the game and made some variations, conclusions and suggestions. I would be glad if you comment them in addition to comments that you were going to write.


Hi. My name is Micha. You can find me on KGS as Tobamf.


first some points:

1. Best way to improve until 10k is to play lots. I bought lots of books etceteras, but nothing helped my progress like playing regularily.

2. This game ended up being very close. The final score was W + 1.5. Games with close scores like these are usually determined in yose (end game).  As a result, I may have more comments in the end of the game.

3. Always remember to connect your groups (to keep them strong), and to cut your opponents groups where feasible (to keep them weak). This doesn't just apply to local fights, it applies all over the board. Try and think of your groups as continuous connected chains of stones, rather than a set of rocks surrounding some territory.

4. Take my advice with a grain of salt. It's not 'my way or the highway', rather I will suggest some alternatives which may be better (hopefully not worse) than the moves you chose.]

(;B[kq]LB[iq:A][pr:B]C[Now, my fuseki is a load of garbage, but a pincer in this situation seems like a good idea, simply because it splits white and gives him 2 groups.if you end up with 1 weak group, it stands to reason you are better off since he will have 2 weak groups.

Notice white A here is 1 stone wider than in the variation. This gives white a lot more room on the side. As a result, white becomes a bit more stable. A more stable white means a less advantageous position for black.]
;W[iq]C[and so W expands to make a wide as possible base.];B[ko]
C[This jump looks fine to me.];W[cn]C[Looks like there are a lot of variations here. Hard to say which one is best that reflects the most reasonable moves from both black and white.]

(;B[co]C[I think black was better off to split white here.]
;W[dn];B[dq]C[Black is safe, but his group is cut off from the outside. As a result, its use is limited severly for the rest of the game.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[eh]C[Joseki not fullfiled. What to do?

Black would like to aim for B13 I think, but the ensuing fight will weaken D10 a lot. Therefore, I think black is best off to protect the D10 stone.]

(;B[jq]LB[hq:A][lq:B][pr:C]C[you might also consider pincering here. The reason is that white has less room for either stone to expand and form a base. Compare to the other move 4, letter A.
Here A, B, C are white moves for trying to make a base. Both A and B give white a narrow sort of extension, meaning there is not much room on the side to make eyes.]
