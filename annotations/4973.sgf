C[Hello,

thanks for reviewing this game!! ^-^
I'm very happy with winning it, because I was quite behind during the opening and middle game but catched up towards the endgame. I'd like to know if you can give some recommendations or hints about the general direction of playing - both mine and my opponents. What was good, what was accetable and what was completely wrong.

Thanks in advance!

Niko

Hi. I've tried to find some key points and give you some thoughts.

DrPepper];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]LB[ce:A][de:B][eq:C]

(;W[ce]C[so far ok? or should't I let him build up so solidly?

DrPepper: It is ok. With white's komi it is easier for white to compete like this, but I feel like this white formation would be better with C4 at D3 or D4. With C4 as it is, I feel like the high enclosure might be considerable. See var.]
;B[eq]LB[hp:B][dq:A]C[DrPepper: I feel like the K17 area is bigger for black, who looks to try to develop quickly across the board. The 4-4 stone likes to develop quickly down the board, and also white wants to make a good extension from the enclosure. Seems like the most valuable place to me.

I can't say this territorial approach is bad, but it seems to say, "OK, I made my chinese formation, it can take care of itself." If I were going to play here I would be tempted to make the high approach myself, which would work better with a moyo game.]

(;W[dq]C[DrPepper: Please do not play this. This helps black make a very good formation. White does not get adequate compensation. See var.]
;B[ep];W[dn]LB[dn:C][ep:B][dq:A]TR[ip][jp][iq][jq]C[DrPepper: The "A-B" exchange helps black. Best to just play "C" directly if you are going to play this at all. The only time this exchange is worthwhile is if "C" is already in place and you can play at the marked area, or if you already have a stone in the marked area to make black heavy and/or overconcentrated.]
;B[iq]C[DrPepper: Black is so low. He should play high here.]
;W[nc]LB[ep:B][dq:A]TR[qk][iq][pq]C[where else?
looked like the only point without fightinh guarantee... ^^

DrPepper: Yes.

I would say this marks the end of the fuseki. White's score is easier to estimate than black's, so counting this early is tough. Instead we should just take a broader view of the game.

Black's framework is spread out well but it is also pretty low (marked stones). I think white has time for this play, and it grows white's control while shrinking black's so it is a fine point in its own right. No need to get jealous of your opponent's areas when you can build your own! The game feels somewhat even here, except for the A-B exchange earlier which was greatly in black's favor.]
;B[lc]LB[qc:C][ne:A][qf:B]C[...but still...

DrPepper: Some other ideas to consider.]
(;W[ne]C[DrPepper: I prefer invasion, but this plan is fine too.]
;B[qf]LB[pb:A][jc:B]TR[pf]C[DrPepper: Low! Black should play at the marked location without hesitation in my opinion.]

(;W[pb];B[qc];W[ic]LB[pb:A][qc:B]C[wanted to use my strength and build territory
 - but at the same time I have to take care of my right side group...not easy

DrPepper: It is a fine plan, but white again made an exchange that was favorable to black. There is no need to make this exchange. White should leave the option of invading at R17 for later: that way the O17 stone is light, which is exactly what you want since you are emphasizing the enclosure with J17. 

If you think about it, you are expecting your O17 group to live well and reduce black, and still get profit from this pincer. It is a lot to ask, isn't it? What is black getting? Fair play suggests he should also be getting something. If you're hoping to take some profit by J17, common go sense should dictate that O17 will suffer. So then you need to find a way to treat O17 lightly. If you cannot find a way of treating it lightly, then the counter-pincer plan is not good and it is simply greedy go.

After this exchange, white's group is much heavier and has no opportunities for easily connecting under/over M17. See earlier variation.]
;B[le];W[mf]LB[kf:A][lf:B]C[pushing a little]
(;B[kf]LB[lf:A]C[DrPepper: Black should play "A" here.];W[if]
C[to far away? i couldn't resist...

DrPepper: It is ok.];B[jd]LB[of:B][kh:A]C[DrPepper: No point for this black move. Black should jump or attack.]
;W[id];B[je];W[og]LB[lg:C][pg:D][mh:A][nh:B]C[good shape I persume...

DrPepper: I think C is strongest, compromising black's diagonal move (damaging his eyeshape).  "A" and "B" are better shape. If you're not going to play this, I'd lean on black's corner with "D". This move you played feels like it is asking black to develop his position (that is, move up to the fourth line).]
;B[ph]LB[kh:A]C[DrPepper: I think black can just jump to "A".]
;W[kb]LB[lg:A]C[I think "A" is better.];B[kc]LB[lb:A]C[DrPepper: I think "A" is better.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[mc];B[ie];W[he];B[jb];W[nb];B[ka];W[ma]LB[jc:A]
[hf:B]
(;B[jc]LB[ib:A][hg:B]C[DrPepper: This move cuts two live groups and makes zero eyes.]

(;W[ib]C[what about this sequence?  mistakes on both sides it seems to me / or at least unneccesarry moves?

DrPepper: This move is extremely slow. Black still has only one eye, and this doesn't change that... attack from the other side.]
;B[hf];W[ge]C[DrPepper: This is very painful.];B[ig]LB[rn:A]
[mr:B]TR[aa][ca][da][oa][ab][mb][ac][cc][fc][gc][ad][ed][fd]
[an][cn][ao][ap][aq][ar][as]SQ[sc][kd][sd][se][if][sf][sg][sh]
[qi][si][sj][rq][sq][fs][gs][hs][is][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[DrPepper: Groups are settled. Good time for a count.

A very basic count gives black 21 (pairs) versus white's 20 (pairs). White gets 6.5 points for komi, or 3 more pairs, for 21 (B) to 23 (W). We could quibble over exactness, it doesn't matter. The point is, cash in hand, white is probably leading.

Unfortunately, when you then consider potential areas and start counting for the influence of black's group on top, black is definitely ahead. You can consider that it will be impossible for white to secure the left side in one more move, and any hope of contributing to it by attacking black's center group is gone. Black will get some points at "A" or "B", I don't see any way for white to invade both, so there's at least another 6 pairs for black.  Black's center group has some good influence so it should count for another 4 pairs. So white's job is going to be to keep black to a minimimum in terms of gain along the bottom, right, and center, while somehow getting points on the left side in the process. Seems very difficult.

Since white has to hold black back...];W[po]C[This was absolutely necessary...or where else?

DrPepper: You are settled everywhere so it is fine to start a new group. This seems like the most valuable area to me.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]LB[mn:B][pn:A]
(;W[pn]C[DrPepper: Heavy.];B[nq]LB[np:B][op:A]C[I would be very tempted to play "A", or maybe even "B", as black here.]
;W[no]LB[qi:A]TR[qk]C[ok?

DrPepper. You can make a two-space jump which is faster, but it is hard to critique a one-point jump. If you don't think you will ever really get to invade at "A", then you might consider leaning on / making contact with the marked black stone to get some strength, then come back and deal with the bottom.]
;B[ia]C[strange...

DrPepper: I agree.];W[fo]LB[dj:B][io:A]TR[og]C[threathening g3 and d10

DrPepper: I'm not sure that encouraging black to defend here is that good of a plan (haunting memories of P13). Why not just play C10 or D10 directly if you want to build your area? The "A" cap is also considerable. Since black is a little too spread out along the bottom it gives you a lot of reduction options.]
;B[gp];W[ok]C[to make it saver...

DrPepper: It's gote. If you want to (try to) get some strength in sente then "contact play for defense."]
;B[oh]C[DrPepper: This seems like gote to me. D10 or C10 seem good.]
;W[nh];B[cj]LB[ch:A][cl:B]C[DrPepper: I thought G3 and D10 were your miai? Seems like black got both... ;)]

(;W[ch]LB[ib:A][hf:B][fo:A][ep:B][gp:B][dq:A]C[right side?

DrPepper: I don't think so. Your enclosure is pretty strong, and has some influence nearby to help it weather anything black is going to throw at you. White's shape in the bottom left is thin. The "A-B" exchanges have helped black so much that he can play with impunity in your area.]
;B[cm];W[dm]C[and this one?];B[dl];W[cn];B[bm];W[el];B[ek];W[cl]
C[a mistake by black?

DrPepper: No. Black isn't going to accomplish much in your area because he is so heavily outnumbered. All he needs to do is live/escape and his work is done.]
;B[dk];W[bl];B[bk];W[bn];B[fl];W[em]LB[fo:A][gp:B]C[Now "A-B" has become a terrible move.]

;B[di];W[dh];B[fj];W[io]LB[fo:A][gp:B]C[what about j5? where to play else?

DrPepper: This move would have been better before A-B. Not it just encourages black to fix his problems again.]
;B[kp]LB[gk:A][mq:B]
(;W[gk]LB[mq:A]C[hm....wasnt sure about it....no real concept...but afterwards I tried building territory in the lower center and succeeded - but I think just because of carelessness on blacks side

DrPepper: What about "A"? It is a fairly routine followup to the capping move O5. You are correct that white should make zero useful territory in the center.]
