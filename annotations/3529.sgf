C[Dear Reviewer,
I played White in this game, and I resigned because Black was leading by a big margin.
Bascially he managed to enclose large territories in the corners, and I did not find an effective way to attack and enclose bigger territory.
Could you help me find where I went wrong?
Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]
;W[eb];B[dh];W[nc]C[Is this approach correct? I did not like the end result...

CG:This approach move looks perfectly ok.];B[ob]C[Black used this move effectively more time in this game - how would you answer it? May be R14?

CG: This move looks strange, doesn't it?
It is a kind of move you play when you are strong and have already a stone around K16 in place. Of course you can answer at R14, but O18 should also lead to a reasonable result.]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[jc]C[CG: This looks strange. You must not give your opponent the hane at O16 - never ever. Don't be afraid of a pincer - you are strong at the top and should welcome a fight there! I think black will answer around Q14 if you play O16 - the follow up at Q15 would be severe!]
;B[nd];W[md]C[CG: What would happen if black cuts? I don't think you could handle this - N16 does not workl!]

(;B[me]
(;W[ld]LB[ld:A][ne:B]C[Shoud I have cut on O15?
CG: I don' think so.];B[le];W[ke]C[CG: Again this looks too thin. White should play L16 instead.]

(;B[kf]
(;W[lb]LB[lb:A][je:B]C[Was M18 too submissive? May be K15 better?
 CG: No, K15 does not work because of N17.Maybe you should still play L16, although this looks very slow.]
;B[je];W[kd];B[mf]C[Now Black has strong thickness and his territory in the corner is even bigger than what I have on the top.

CG: Yes, because you missed the vital point O16! 
BTW: N14 is bad shape - O14 looks better.];W[pj]C[Too close to Black's thickness?

CG: No, I think dividing the right side is ok. However, I would rather play R10 - it's easier to get a base on the third line.]
;B[ph];W[qn];B[ro]C[Here it comes again...]
(;W[ql]C[CG: This no shape at all! Since you played Q10, you should continue at P6!!
Just compare the variation with the game after black 35 ...]
;B[qi];W[cj]C[Too close to Black group?

CG: No, but I would rather move with the eyeless group on the right.]
;B[np]C[CG: Black just takes territory and while threatening your stones on the right.]
;W[on];B[bi]C[...and again...];W[cm];B[cp]
(;W[co]C[I select to give up the corner - I am not sure if this was right

CG: This way C7 ends up too close to your thickness. I think C3 would have been better.]
;B[dq]
(;W[do];B[bq];W[eq];B[dr]
(;W[er]C[CG: I would atari at B4 first - this way B5 will be gote.]

TR[lb][ql][cm]C[I guess G5 is better

CG: Yes, black can cut now. 
However, the game is already very difficult for white. Just look at the three marked stones - the are placed not very well.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[kq];W[kr];B[mq];W[jq];B[mr]C[This was big...
Now Black is leading by far:
bottom right - 20 points
bottom left - 10
top right - 30
top left -20 = 80 points + komi

White:
Top - 20 points
Bottom - 25
Right - 10 = 55 points

I assume neither Black nor White will gain too many points in the center.
In the rest of the game I trying to fight back, but did not really gain much...
What was wrong?
Thanks!

CG: I hope I pointed out some bad moves.
Don't be afraid of moves on the second row. If your opponent clinges on territory like this, you can build up influence and a large moyo. However, if you answer S5 at R8, black has gained an advantage. And more important: Don't let your opponent take points like O16!!!]
