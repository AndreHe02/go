C[Leksand Open Round 2
Olof Fridh 5 kyu (black) vs Eddie Chang 4kyu (white)
1 hour main time, 15 stones in 5 min byo-yomi

This is a fun game, a lot of fighting. I got behind in the beginning but managed to come back toward the end, finally lost because I read something wrong.

Hi Olof,
I am Peter Hoehe, 1k in Germany. As your strength is pretty close to mine, so please don't expect a highly accurate revision.
But I will do my very best.
I enjoyed the review very much. It *was* a fighting game indeed.
My KGS nick is go4fun, so I prefix my comments with g4.];B[pd]
;W[dc];B[oq]C[Olof: This is my normal fuseki.];W[dp];B[ce];W[cd]
C[g4: Not good by w. Attaching makes stronger.];B[de];W[fd]
;B[ci]C[g4: Indeed];W[qq];B[po];W[qo]
(;B[pn]C[Olof: I didn't dare to hane here, my knowledge of the joseki that follows are not good enough.

g4: This is surely playable, but see also the variation.];W[rn]
C[g4: Too low for fuseki.];B[qm]C[Olof: My opponent backed of (I think white R6 is joseki), I thought a long time between k3 and r7. Still think I made the right choice

g4: I would have preferred K3. The reason is, that S6 stone is too low, so white has no good follow up there. Should he play R8?]
;W[gq]C[g4: I would prefer something around J3 or K4.];B[cm]
C[g4: I think there are bigger moves. Since the C15 group is safe, there is no need to play. I would prefer K3 or S7 (aiming at S4) or R16 or even L17.]
;W[nc]
(;B[kd]C[Olof: Didn't want to let my opponent get a large terr on the upper side.

g4: I think this the right direction, but for other reasons. The right side is open at S7, so this is not interesting. B could consider blocking at Q17, because the right side cannot be closed with one move.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[Olof: Maybe I should have played o16, but o17 was the stone I wanted to attack so I leaned on the other one.

g4: Ok];W[qc]
(;B[qe]C[Olof: I thought of playing q17 but couldn't find a good way to contain o17.

g4: I think this is the wrong direction. O17 seems dead to me after the variation.]
;W[pc]
(;B[me]C[Olof: I guess R13 is honte but I wanted to keep my stones connected.

g4: This is a steady way of playing.];W[re]C[g4: mistake by white.]
;B[qg]C[g4: BIgger mistake by Black. Why not S14?];W[rf];B[jq]
C[Olof: I missed the cut at q13.

g4: This is definitely a good move. The cut at Q13 is not so big.]
;W[pg];B[qh]C[g4: Black is asking for trouble. Why not play simple P14? White has to answer. Then Black has sente. There are bigger points. I would like to play C3 or G17 or even E7 or K5.]
;W[of];B[pe]
(;W[nf]C[g4: White P15 or O15 and the 4 black stones are as good as dead, see var.]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[ne];W[qj]C[Olof: This feels strange for white.

g4: Strange to me too. Extending at Q12 seems enough.];B[ph]
C[g4: Better at Q11. So Black can play Q10 after wO12.];W[og]
;B[oi];W[ni]C[g4: I prefer M14, then L13.];B[nj];W[mi];B[pj]
C[g4: Good!];W[qk];B[mj];W[li];B[hc]C[Olof: Needed to make some sort of base for my top stones.

g4: You are attacking the white corner. See var.]
(;W[bd]C[Olof: This feels slow for white.

g4: This was necessary as the last variation showed.];B[pl]
C[g4: Why not S7? It has the good follow up at S4 and I don't think the 2 white stones can escape nor connect.]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[rm];B[cp]C[g4: I would prefer F18 or H15 or L14 strengthening the only weak group to attack freely.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[be]C[Olof: Another slow move giving me the possibility to get back in the game.

g4: This is too low. B3 is a must.]
(;B[kk]C[g4: The cut at D3 is effective. See var.];W[km]C[Olof: L9 was ment to be an attack on the weak white group but white got greedy.

g4: White tries to reduce....];B[ji]C[Olof: So I contiune to attack.

g4: Good];W[jh];B[ih]C[Olof: Here I thougt of the inside hane but I don't think it works very well

g4: Ok];W[jg]
(;B[ii]C[Olof: Too slow? I always try to have good shape then attaking, leaving a cutting point like here often proves fatal.

g4: But bear in mind, that you are strong everywhere but the top. A cutting point will be annoying only if white can break through. I would have tried. see var. If you fear cutting points, it is ok if you surround white by far, then H13 might be the move.]
;W[if]C[g4: Now the attack nearly vanishes.];B[he];W[ie];B[id]
;W[hf];B[ge];W[fe]C[Olof: Greedy move by white, tries to capture c15 and d15 while still having a weak group.

g4: I think he is aiming at he top, but it doesn't work.];B[gf]
;W[hg];B[ff]C[g4: G11!];W[gh];B[ei]C[g4: G10!];W[gj];B[hk];W[gk]
;B[hl];W[ek];B[ck];W[fh];B[dg];W[fm]C[g4: This is a success for white. He is territorially leading Black has only his moyo to win. This seems not so easy.]
;B[hn];W[im];B[hm];W[ip]C[g4: Risky as white is not connected, but if white is sure to live...]
;B[fo]C[Olof: I am behind by a lot so I need to do something.

g4: This is sente. White has to protect his weak goup. He should have played F5 himself.]
;W[ki];B[kj]C[g4: You loose sente for what??? I would try H4 or F4.]
;W[dl];B[lg]C[Olof: Trying to destroy whites eyeshape but I went in to far.

g4: Perhaps G12 works. But M14 is also good. But perhaps M13 is working too?]
;W[mf]
(;B[ke]C[Olof: this is a bad move, should have played m15 instead, now I need to go back and defend here.]
;W[lf];B[md];W[jp]C[g4: The game is over now. White leads by 25 points, and has entered the black moyo.]
;B[kq];W[ol]C[g4: ? Just protecting some weak points will be enough to win. F4 is essential.]
;B[mm];W[pp];B[no]C[g4: Just P4.];W[op];B[np];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr]
;B[mr]C[g4: P2 works well.];W[or];B[fq]C[Olof: I am becoming desperate.]
;W[go];B[gp];W[hp];B[fp];W[gn];B[ho]C[g4: This is a desaster for white. The moyo turns to territory.]
;W[gr];B[iq];W[hq];B[er];W[dr];B[eq];W[do];B[fn]C[g4: D6. White cannot cut due to D3]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[dn];B[gm]C[g4: D3!];W[cl];B[bl];W[bq];B[bp]C[Olof: And of course I to am too greedy.

g4: :-)];W[bk];B[bj];W[bm];B[dq];W[cr];B[ak];W[bn];B[bf]C[Olof: Now what was the purpose of white b16 and b15?]
;W[mp];B[kp]C[g4: M4 is fine.];W[oo];B[nn];W[om];B[on];W[pm]
;B[nl];W[ql];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[dd];W[gc]C[Olof: This is a bad furikawari for white.]
;B[cc]C[g4: nice try];W[ed]
(;B[bc]C[g4: You could try C18 instead. see var. But as you are leading, there is no need to take a risk.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[ee];B[fg]C[g4: H18 is sente.];W[cf];B[df];W[af]
;B[bg];W[ac];B[ad];W[ae];B[db];W[ec];B[cb];W[hb]C[Olof: And suddely it's a close game.

g4: I don't think so. Black gained 30 points on the left and 50 points in the center. White has 20 points in the lower left, 20 points in the upper roght, and 25 poitns in the lower right. So Black leads by 15 points..]
;B[ib];W[ha];B[lc];W[jb];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[lb]C[Olof: Overplay but I missed to use is.]

g4: K17 is fine.];W[jc];B[ic];W[ia];B[ka];W[jd]C[Olof: Missed this atari, game over.

White played very territorial in the beginning, I didn't keep up and got behind by a lot. I often go for outside strength instead of terr but this time I felt that my strength was too weak compared to his terr. But then he got greedy and I got the opportunity to cut of large groups on the lower side. This made the game close again.

g4: Black should protect his moyo when it was possible. 
Try to attack when you are strong. 
There were only some slight mistakes, and I am not sure about everything.]
