C[Arend: ChessWhiz, playing black, had sent me this game for review, after he had crushed me in a 9 stone teaching game. His comment was:   "Here's a game in which I won by just 2.5, but the whole time, I thought I was losing. Both
players are KGS unrated. I have annotated it rather deeply, and would like
your comments on it. It was a nice, well-thought-out game, but looking back
at it, I can already see where I might have done better. :-)"

Arend:
You showed very good reading skills in this game, I would guess better than most players at your level. And excellent fighting spirit! But now, you need to learn to use your skills a little better. Don't attack for the sake of attacking! Always try to benefit from your attack; benefit means gaining territory or thickness, while the opponent has to defend. Don't weaken your own groups while attacking! Don't invest too many points in an attack where you cannot kill!  You'll see, there are quite a few examples for this in the game, I've marked them all with (*). If you adjust your goals in fighting a little, you'll soon become a lot stronger than you are now, I promise...

Apart from that, the biggest upsets that happened in the game were   - a very large endgame clamp that was missed by both players for a long time
 - white playing a lot of moves far too small in the endgame; this cost white about 15 points (rough estimate).

Good luck for further improvements!];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[pj];W[cf];B[jd]C[I'm pretty planless in the fuseki, so I pretty much just take the hoshi points and make a big moyo in this game.
Arend: That is good play so far. But you should also try out other fusekis sometimes.]
;W[fq];B[jp];W[qg]C[Now. How to continue?];B[pf]LB[qe:A][re:B]
C[Should I have played at 'a' or 'b' to limit his base on the side?
Arend: You should play 'a'! Why? Because it secures the corner while attacking. (*)
Also, this kind of move rather helps your opponent to strengthen him. See the variation.]

(;W[rj];B[ri]C[Strike at the waist of the keima. But this is a *large* keima, so is this move still acceptable? It seemed to work well in the game.
Arend: Strike against the waist of the keim is when you want to cut; this is something different here.  I don't think the sequence is good for Black.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[rk];W[si]LB[rl:A]C[Moves 13-18 seem to produce a fine result for black.
Arend: I am not convinced. Not that white can always clamp at A here, so you haven't made territory int the lower right yet. Hence, you gave white a secure eye (with the ponnuki) for free.]
;B[oh]LB[re:A][rf:B][qk:C]C[This move is probably too small, but I want to keep my central moyo intact. Perhaps it was better at 'a'. Or maybe even closer, at 'b'?
Arend: The problem with this move is that it creates another cutting point at C. See the variation.]

(;W[re]LB[rd:A]C[Arend: I think white should jump one space further to 'A' here.]
;B[rf]LB[rc:A][rd:B]C[Here's the real keima, but I think my attachment is premature. Playing at 'a' seems better.
Arend: Yes, A or B here.];W[qf];B[qe];W[rd]LB[rg:A]C[I overlooked this move when I played B21. I thought he would stay small with a move at 'a'. Silly me.]
;B[ck]C[I can see, looking back at it, that the 21-24 exchange was bad for black. With C9, I plan to invade and limit white's territory on the left side. Letting white play there looks too good for him.  Is this a good point on which to invade? I figure that the two marked points are miai for making a base.
Arend: Yes, this is exactly the move to play here. Very good!]
;W[mq]C[I stil don't know the best move in a case like this...]
;B[oq]LB[rl:A]C[Defending the corner. The lower-right looks like moderately solid black territory now.
Arend: ...apart from that clamp at A.  I think P3 is good -- you hust have to watch out that your stone at K4 doesn't get too weak.]
;W[jr];B[lr]C[Another cut. I'm not sure if this is a good move.
Arend: No, this is not good. You attacked withouth checking whether you actually get a good result! (*)]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[kp];B[mp]LB[lp:A];W[lp];B[nq]
(;W[jo]LB[mo:A]C[I glad he didn't play at 'a' first.
Arend: Yes, white should have played here.];B[mo]C[Expanding the lower-right.
Arend: But still, there is this hole at S8...];W[io]TR[jp]LB[kr:A]
C[I plan to give up the marked stone, obviously.
Arend: As White A is still sente, this is a little overconcentrated by white.]
;B[gc]C[Is this the biggest play? Or is there one that's more urgent?
Arend: I think this is good!];W[ci];B[cn]C[Practically forced.]
;W[eo];B[ek]C[I don't want to get pressed low, but perhaps a move in the upper region would have been better.]
;W[mc]C[Not again!];B[ob]C[This time I have a different strategy... keep him from making a base, and chase him out into the center where I can attack him with my wall.]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[jb];B[lb]C[Now this seems move seems to work well!
Arend: I disagree...];W[lc];B[mb];W[nc];B[na]C[I have succeeded in my plan. He has no eyespace, and is now quite heavy, forcing him into the center.]
;W[kb];B[oa]LB[ma:A]TR[lb][mb]C[Forced, to save to two marked stones from the throw-in at 'a'. I consider these stones very valuable, because they leave eat up his eye-space.
Arend: Sure, but...];W[kd]C[Arend: ...it forces your opponent to play a move that weakens your K16 stone a lot.]
;B[jc];W[kc]LB[pg:A]C[Arend: Now your stones at G17 and K16 got really weak -- weaker than the white group you are attacking.
Also, white has still a cut at A, and then the black group in the upper right doesn't have eyes yet.]
;B[je];W[lf];B[me]C[The eye-stealing tesuji.
Arend: This is not interesting. If white answers...]
(;W[ne];B[mf];W[le];B[nf];W[kg]C[Should I be trying to kill him, or just take profit while chasing him?
Arend: always the latter...
The white group is not as weak as you think. Note that white can always make an eye at the top in sente (see the variation)]

(;B[ig]C[Arend: This is good, because it strengthens your weak group white attacking -- no other move is possible here I think.]
;W[li];B[mj]C[I really liked this move... it secures the lower-right for me.
Arend: Yes, that is good! Maybe one point lower gives a little better shape.]
;W[ji];B[hi];W[kk];B[jh]C[Arend: B73 and...];W[kh];B[lj]TR[ki]
C[Making the marked point a false eye. But now he has threats to connect to the lower group.
Arend: ...B75 are bad. You cannot kill this group. If you try to prevent the connection
to the lower left group, white can easily get an eye.
Also, B73 is bad shape, and B75 might cost a liberty.];W[kj]
;B[lm]C[Arend: This is good.];W[lk];B[mk];W[mi];B[ni];W[mg]
;B[mh]LB[sk:A][rl:B]C[Yes! He still doesn't have any eyes. But, considering the fact that he's threatening to connect to the lower group, should I  just ignore his last play and tenuki instead? I can see that this move at N12 is rather useless, other than removing an eye.
Arend: Indeed! Better make territory somewhere. Either take the BIG move at A (I think white can still do s.th. with the clamp at B.
White can   - easily connect to the lowe group with K7,
- certainly get an eye around K10 if you try to prevent that
- still get that sente eye at J19.
So he certainly alive, even if you don't see the possible eye at L14/M16.]
;W[ln];B[km]LB[mn:A][mm:B]C[Arend: No! You give up so many points for the sake of attacking! Play A or B. (*)]
;W[mn];B[jl]C[Concentrating on cutting him off.];W[jk];B[il]
C[At this point, I thought I had him.
Arend: White can easily break out.]
(;W[ik]C[Arend: This is not ambitious enough.];B[hk];W[ij]LB[on:A]
[ln:B]C[Argh, now he has one eye.
Arend: No -- yeah, yeah, he has made a one point play, I will get a 15 points play (at B93)...of coursem the problem is the openness of your territory at A; you have invested too much into this attack (by not reacting to white B), so that even this superb result of getting the exchange W92 - B93 might not good enough for you.]
;B[hj];W[ng];B[og];W[jg];B[ih]
(;W[ke]C[And he makes miai of the two circled points, creating his second eye! I'd better rethink my strategy here.
Arend: This way to live is a little small. See the variations.]
;B[jf]C[Wasting a ko threat, but strengthening my wall.];W[md]
;B[nn]C[*Whew!* I didn't want him coming in there!];W[mm];B[nm]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[hl]TR[il][jl][km][lm]C[But there is a price to pay...]
;B[eb]C[Wasting some of the good aji in the corner. Was this simply bad for me?
Arend: Yes, because it doesn't make territory.];W[db];B[ib]
;W[ee]
(;B[bq]C[Trying to live. I can't let him get all the lower-left.
Arend: Intesting sequence! But let's first see whether ordinary endgame moves might be enough...]
;W[bp];B[dp];W[do];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr]C[Hey! I *think* this is the tripod group!]
;W[eq];B[br]C[Now I can live by force, although I live very small.
Arend: Very good reading. I am not sure whether white can deviate from this sequence.]
;W[cs];B[bs];W[ds]C[Arend: This is bad of course.];B[er];W[fr]
;B[es];W[fs];B[cr];W[bo]LB[am:A][gl:B][fj:C][dl:D][bm:E]C[I am glad he didn't monkey-jump me at 'a' instead. I think this move was somply bad for him.
Arend: Yes. But I wouldn't monkey jump either. Locally, I think white should play at B. This is not small territorially, threatens to attack the three black stones at C and looks for the sequence peep at D, follow-up at E to caputre the black stone at C3.]
;B[dd]C[Trying to start something in the corner...]
(;W[cd]LB[ed:A]C[But he plays it safe. I was hoping he would block at 'a' so I could attempt to live under him.
Arend: Now he got too afraid. He shold play at A. This time, you cannot possibly make life there.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[de];B[bj];W[bi];B[dg];W[cg]LB[rl:A]C[Arend: No need for white to answere here. A is still the move!]
;B[ai];W[dh];B[bh];W[bg];B[eg]LB[gl:A][gm:B][sk:C]C[Arend: This is very small.
Still play the atari at A, follow-up at B and close the territory at C.]
;W[ff];B[fh];W[gl];B[bn]C[I'm pretty sure he should have monkey-jumped me, but now I prevent it in gote.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[of];B[oe]
(;W[nh]LB[rl:A]C[Arend: I think this takes away the possibility of A. Before this move,  it still works, see the variation.]
;B[oj]LB[rl:A]C[Arend: As you can easily see yourself, white at A no longer works.]
;W[qb];B[fn]C[I have to reduce him somehow.];W[fm];B[em];W[gn]
;B[en]C[He kindly lets me connect out in sente.
Arend: White should have cut.];W[fo];B[kr]C[We're down to the little endgame plays, but maybe this isn't the best? Where should I play at this point?
Arend: If you get this point in sente, this is wonderful! (Because it would have been sente for white, too.)]
;W[jq];B[sk]C[Arend: Still big. I'd think that F18 is a little bigger, though.]
;W[sj]C[Arend: This is very bad! A one point move (or maybe 2). F17 is a lot larger, L1 too (it is sent for white).]
;B[qa];W[rb];B[lo];W[kn]LB[ko:A]C[Arend: A is correct.];B[fl]
C[Keep that sente!];W[gm];B[fe];W[ef];B[gf];W[fg];B[eh];W[gg]
;B[hf];W[gh]LB[gb:A]C[Arend: Again too small. A is a lot better.]
;B[fb]C[Arend: Good.];W[qq]C[Whoa! I think I can kill him, although I don't know the exact move order.
Arend: Ok, here you are allowed to go for the kill...];B[rp]
C[This seems to work.];W[rq]C[How nice of him to keep it simple.]
;B[qp];W[pr];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs]C[He's dead now.];W[or];B[nr]
;W[os];B[qs];W[sq]C[What? That was simply a wasted move, and at a very vital time! I think that move was what lost the game for him.
Arend: Yes, that costs a lot.];B[da]C[Now I can leak through, and in sente! He should have played here last move.]
;W[cb]LB[ca:A]C[Arend: White can resist at A. (That's a two point loss.)]

Arend: Well, you were certainly behind before the endgame, but white allowed you to catch up easily with a couple of far too small moves, a lot of them being an unnecessary answers where he could have tenukied -- moral: endgame is important, and: When in doubt, tenuki (at least in the endgame).]
