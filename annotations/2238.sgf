C[I won this game, but not in the way I wanted.

My history in KGS is pretty violent. In most of my games I end up playing extremely aggressive moves and capturing a lot. I win if my opponets make more mistakes than I.

My  trouble is that I seem to be unable to win players who are tactically stronger or equall. In this game I try to avoid aggressive moves and to play take safe teritory.

I'v been told that student should not tell what teacher should do, so please comment as you feel most appropriate.

Hi, 

I tried to give some comments related to these issues.  But first -- your moves are not overly aggressive -- they are exactly as aggressive as they should be relative to the situations you find yourself in!  Your fighting instincts are good and you should be happy with them.  I'll comment more on this later.  

Best,
Chris];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qj]C[If I plan to play safe teritory, I must do something for this framework.]
;B[cf];W[fc]C[__
This is a bit defensive, which is not the same as saying solid.  Black is outnumbered in this part of the board, and if you want to keep up you need to put more pressure on the black stone.  If not a pincer, you should at the very least play f16, cramping the stone a bit and making the top, the last really open and mutally contestable part of the board, worth developing in the sente you get as a result of this approach.]
;B[ci];W[ck]C[Upper side could be bigger, but it would leave these moves for black as sente.
__

The upper part of the board is bigger, and you should probably play there first.  As it happened in this game, b answered so it was alright.]
;B[ei];W[qg]C[__
This is not the direction of play I'd prefer.  Your r10 stone is perfectly fine, and despite f17 you still have a chance to develop the top after an exchange here (eg.,by leaning on the black upper left side group)  This very slow, base-making move gives away territory and should be used when you are pressured.]
;B[mc];W[qn]C[__
This shape is not good and shows again the problem of r13 -- if you had approached from the top, b would have induced you to play r7 naturally, and whatever the response you could then have invaded the bottom.  Now this is yet another third-line move, with the obvious weakness at r8.  Plus this helps black develop the still open bottom.  The problem is that you have very low framework-making potential due to the low, defensive position of your stones.  

I'm somewhat lost for a good move for white right here.  04, disrupting the bottom and pushing black toward your stable right while setting up for h3 might be worth trying?]
;B[np];W[rp];B[ic]C[__
Bad.  Black really should finish the joseki at R3.  White almost has to respond and that will overconcentrate him on the lower right]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[bd]C[Here black has huge advantage.

So what wen't wrong?

__
Well, out of 11 stones, eight are on the third line, and two of the three that are not were the first two moves.  You have played too defensively and gotten behind in development.  This actually forces you to play *more* aggressively, because you are behind and must invade.]
;B[cq]C[If black had chosen safe way to play, he would propably have won without much fus?

This move forces white to fight, C4 is not an option for white.
__
This is not really "bad" for black. The bottom is still open to invasion, though at a cost of influence, so this way he steals white territory and gets you to induce him to solidify a large part of his moyo.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[co];B[bn]C[White should attack lower side now. Black is so strong that white can only hope to ruin some teritory.]
;W[bm];B[cp];W[eo];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bl]C[I played these moves, because I somehow knew that black would answer.
___
Yes, but maybe you ought to finish with b9 and d10, in sente.  If white ignores the push is very, very painful for the c11 stones.]
;W[hq]C[___
Too close to your own thickness.  You aren't really hurting for eyes here yet, and this asks black to strengthen the large part of his bottom moyo, which is still open.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[iq];W[rd]C[___
Low, low, low.  And it erases the 3-3 point, which would be effective considering the low strength of the right side.]
;B[qc];W[fp];B[dk];W[kq]C[And here it snaps and I return to my fighting mode. Weak is my mind.
__

Not weak, smart.  You have no real choice at this point....]
;B[ir]C[___
Black, if he insists on fighting instead of plastering white to the second & third line, should k2 instead of J2.  1) K2 is better shape
2) K2 puts a touch more pressure on the invading stone
3) It makes it easier for b to link his stones later.... This seems small but is an important, bad move.]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[lp];B[mq];W[lq]C[__
Good for white; you've separated b and are in fine shape to run.]
;B[qr]C[__
bad, defensive move.  If he is more worried about this group (no reason to be, the other group is weaker), he should move out to 06 to stabilize and attack, keeping white separated and flat on the right.]
;W[in]C[This is a bad move I guess, but I plan to stress black a little to make a moyo at left side.

__
One move over, at k6, was the spot.  Your aim is chase, strengthen your running group, and in the process make great thickness in the center.  No need to be so agressive here.  Especially since you played so conservatively on the bottom (h3) -- you should push against that stable group, not try to cap completely.  

If you want to avoid getting into unpredictable kill-or-be-killed fights, don't play more defensively, as in your opening, but rather attack more solidly.]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[io]C[Black K7 would have destroyed everything that I had in mind.

___
Yes, it would have. Although by playing up along the L-line, and with p6 in sente and can make a pretty decent  lower-middle-center moyo, it isn't enough.]
;W[jm];B[hn];W[im];B[hm];W[go];B[ho];W[ik];B[gl];W[on]C[___
Excellent thinking for white -- you've very effectively plastered b down, shrunk his territory, and created a moyo out of a difficult situation -- in sente, no less!]
;B[rq];W[qp];B[rr];W[nf]C[___
A nice move.  Loose but versatile, with a good sense of how much you need to aim at and what you can get away with.]
;B[mi]C[White moyo was so weak that black should perhaps have reduced it while increasing his own teritory. Now white battle plan is to attack J17.


___
Not sure where you think b could increase his own and reduce yours very effectively...   b around m15 would let white take too much in the center, and white can reduce the top pretty effectively since both his corner and center are strong...]
;W[lg];B[mg]C[__
bad, just strengthens white.  m12 would help b make shape and run more effectively.]
;W[mf];B[ph];W[qh]C[It kind of hurts for white to let his grand moyo get reduced to third-line territory.]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[og]C[__
But now b is just making himself cramped and hurting his corner at the same time.]
;W[pe];B[ki]C[__
b has too many cutting points....];W[jf];B[ii];W[hj];B[hi]C[__
Black induces white to hurt his other running group.   Better for b to expand downward around m9, making better shape while threatening to connect at bottom or to cut white's lower middle group.]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[ek]C[__
good.];B[dj]C[__
b is in a tough spot now.  though f10 would solve his life/death problems, he can't so easily give away the c9 stone now that his top is weakened and his bottom split -- where else is his territory? This game is starting to look very bleak for black...  (had he played k2 earlier, he would have had m2 in reserve and not have run into the same problems]

(;W[ll];B[lj];W[hl];B[es];W[gm]C[This was wery mature for me - usually I fight to the bitter end. I think that with black weaknesses this is the right move.

__
Yes, this is a hard thing to do often.  Of course, in this case you still had clear ko threats to escape with the 10-line group, so you could have made b sweat a bit more. Once you take, though, b has almost no chance.  Way too many weak groups.]
;B[gs];W[ji];B[kh];W[jh];B[kg]C[__
b is only hurting his top, and badly, with these moves.];W[kf]
;B[jg];W[lh]C[_
good, strengthens w and destroys b's false hopes for an eye]
;B[mh];W[lf];B[li];W[ig];B[pi];W[oj]C[And here black can live, Q10 might have been better.

_No "might" about that.  You want to play solidly here.  If you don't kill, which you probably can, you build territory in sente and then can decimate the top.]

no reason not to do both.... ;-)];W[mr];B[qm];W[rn]C[_
No reason not to take first ... if you respond and he retakes, then you can always s6, but this way he burns a ko threat.]

yes, b can't save the lone stone and the corner];B[rc];W[ld]

nope.  Maybe b g16 keeps things closer, though.];W[ge]C[_

;W[cd];B[ef];W[sj]C[Black is dead. But even if it would be alive, white might even have a small lead. Black would gain a lot in endgame though.

not quite dead, though it doesn't matter at all.  And white's lead is not quite small, either...]

(;B[rk]C[connecting is total death.  (see variation for ko)]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[ng];B[nh];W[il]C[So here was my latest big capture. It is not a first and it will propably not be the last. I still can't win by making teritory - that is my great weakness. What to do?

__
First: you should fill in the endgame points and score it as though the middle black group were alive: this game is not even close!  It is a landslide in favor of white!  You should know this -- it will affect whether you play agressively or more solidly toward the end of the middle game and afterwards.    

Second: your opponent will never, never idly sit by and let you make more territory than him/her.  Conflict is an inevitable part of the game; the part you want to work on is fighting more solidly from a supportive, developable framework, and with the purpose of expanding territory, not killing.  (contrast with the third line positions you had to work from in this game.)  Of course, you cannot shrink from all-or-nothing fights that result from your opponent's overplays or desperate attempts to come back -- life/death fights are also inevitable sometimes.  In general I'd say you should be more satsifed with your game -- you play well!


Try to expand on the most developable sides first, and be defensive only when you are outnumbered or have a particular plan (such as using the defensive strength to push your enemy against and make territory on the other side)  

That being said, you did a really great job coming back and turning the game around with that invasion.  You have good instincts for invasion and fighting, and read those situations well -- work a bit more on reading threatening/expanding moves with the same care.  

Hope this helps,

Chris])
