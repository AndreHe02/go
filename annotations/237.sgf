C[(zee)I am playing White. I would like pointers on how to play better, especially how I should have used my thickness on the left side.

forfun (ff) - This was an interesting game but difficult to comment.  W started out with a questionable pincer.  B played a standard sequence and had a good position.  W had a difficult time of it.  But there was not an clear way to solve the problem.  I think that the most important pointer for playing better is to have a reason for choosing the way you play, especially in the beginning of the game.  After the game, ask yourself, "did it work like I expected"?  If not, why not?  In this game B seemed to have a better plan.  In the end W won by fighting hard and not giving up.

You asked specifically about the thickness on the left side.  We want to use thickness to attack.  But in this game B had no weak stones so W's wall ended up under attack itself.  Remember, a wall or other thickness is not really helpful if B is able to make all groups safe.  In such a case W has played too slow or in the wrong direction.

I think this game was played on IGS, right?  One of the greatest resources for improving your game is the high dan games on IGS.  I spend a lot of time watching the fast games of the 4d+'s.  Don't think too much, just watch.  Tell yourself, "these are good plays"!  Believe me, even their blunders are better than our good plays.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[cn]C[ff - If you watch the 5d - 7d's play on IGS you will see this opening position occur often.  The most common pincer is in variation 2.  The most common non-pincer is variation 3.]

(;W[dk]C[ff - This looks pretty normal, but we might ask what W hopes to achieve.  The problem is that W has nothing to build on in the upper side.  When B plays the joseki in the game, W does not have a good follow up.]

(;B[en]C[ff - A reasonable choice here.];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bk]
C[ff - What should W do now?  The game choice does not accomplish much because B has already played at B9.]

(;W[cf]C[ff - Because of the stone on B9 this approach is not likely to give a good result.]
;B[ch];W[bd];B[cc];W[ef];B[fd];W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[cj];W[dj]
C[ff - The action on the left side stops.  The question is who has gained from this exchange?  B has territory while W has a wall.  B's stone at E6 is pushing out between W's side and bottom positions.]
;B[hq]C[ff - B strikes first in this interestingly symmetrical position.]
;W[bq]C[ff - This may be the best that W can do.  Usually we want to attack the B stone but since B's position on the left is strong, there seems to be no chance.]
;B[kq]C[ff - B settles the position at the bottom.  What next for W?]

(;W[kc]C[ff - This is a mistake!  W should copy B and attack the B UL corner.]
;B[ic]C[ff - Perfect for B.  It is almost impossible for W to get value from the wall on the left now.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[qf]C[ff - W is on the spot now.];W[qj]
;B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn]C[ff - B has no weak groups while W is subject to attack on both the upper side and the left.  The W left can not be counted as thickness because it is surrounded by strong B stones.]
;B[qh]C[ff - W's lower right group has invasion points at both R3 and R8]
;W[oj];B[ie]C[ff - A tough move splitting the 2 weak W groups.]

(;W[dm]C[ff - This doesn't work.  W needs to play C13 which is a shape play by itself and threatens to make the combination at D7, B8 work.  See the variation.]
