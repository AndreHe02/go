(;B[ec]C[gawron: I don't know this move. The joseki move I know is B14 (see variation).]
;W[bc]
(;B[cb]C[gawron: This is bad because B18 gets sente now. Just capturing at D18 looks normal, B14 might be interesting (although I would not recommend it since I cannot read all the variations).]
;W[bf];B[db]C[gawron: C18 would now be better placed at B18 - you lost a move in this corner.

Keeping sente is very important in fuseki - espescially  when there are three corners where it makes a big difference who moves first.]
;W[eq]C[gawron: This is a good move.];B[do];W[oc]C[gawron: I would not like to play tenuki in the lower left. Both sides should be eager to finish the upper right in sente.]
;B[ld]C[I want to use the thickness on the upper left so I played this move, but he plays K16 in this joseki so I don't think  this idea worked.  What is the best joseki to choose here for black to use the upper left thickness?

gawron: I think this pincer is ok. No matter which pincer you choose - you are not so strong in the upper left that a counter-pincer by white is infeasable. But since you are strong in the upper left, you should not be afraid of a fight on the upper side.

So if you had the idea of turning the whole upper part into black territory, you must not be surprised it didn't work.]
;W[of];B[qg];W[jd];B[lf];W[jf]C[This white move is not in the books.  What should black do to the P17, P14 stones not that white did not play there?

gawron: Look at Ishida, Dictionary of Basic Joseki, Part I, p. 146, Dia. 228, which discusses white P12 (instead of K14). Black should then cut the two space jump. White usually plays in the corner to prevent this. The same variation works now.]

(;B[qp];W[qq]C[I don't see this white move in the books.  DId I respond correctly?

gawron: Yes, I think the hane at S3 is correct.];B[rq];W[pp]
;B[qr]C[gawron: Since you have a low position in the upper right, this is clearly better than R5.]
;W[pr]C[These Ko's in the beginning confuse me.  WHat is whites objective and how was my approach?

gawron: I would have expected white R5 instead of Q2 - a standard sequence after the 3-3 attachment. This way white gets outside thickness while black takes the corner.  I think the easiest way for black is now just to play R5 himself - to prevent being shut in in the corner.]
;B[pq];W[lg];B[mg];W[qq];B[kg]C[gawron: You can only play like this if you are willing to give away the corner and take the ponnuki. Again black R5 would have been easier.]
;W[qo];B[pq]C[gawron: This is bad. Just squeezing at S4 (and then connecting at P5) would give white a good result locally.
Since you played L13, you should capture at M12 now.];W[lh]
C[gawron: Now your ko threat has fired back: you just pushed white from behind with a silly atari (L13) and are left with two cuts. 
Don't play ko threats which lose points! 

If you were not willing to give away the corner, M12 instead of L13 would have been a better ko threat.

In this position, I would play O14 and try to protect one cut in sente.]
;B[qq];W[mf];B[kf];W[me];B[kd];W[po];B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[nq]
C[Now that I am shut-in in this corner, how could I have played better?

gawron: I hope I made clear that you could have avoided being shut in by playing R5 instead of capturing the ko.

Now the game is already difficult for black - white got very thick and the lower right corner is too small as compensation.]
;B[fp]C[gawron: Since white is thick in the upper left, the thickness you are building by pressing here is not very effective. Maybe a pincer at H3 would have been better. But as I said, this is a difficult position - since white is strong in the lower right, too, H3 might lead to a dangerous fight.]
;W[fq]C[gawron: This is heavy.];B[gp]C[Reducing his lower side, right?

gawron: Well, there was no definite territory on the lower side before ... But right, you are reducing the territory white might have built by playing on the lower side first.]
;W[cq];B[gq]C[gawron: This is difficult. I think I would rather play B3 instead of G3, but I might be too focussed on territory. But white B4 is very big!]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[dp];B[co];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo]C[gawron:This is an overplay, as you proved in the game. Black can also capture B4 in sente (see variation) and live on both sides easily. So even if you could not capture F5, it would be a bad move ...]

;B[gm];W[hp];B[io];W[ip]
(;B[dm]C[gawron: This is even too mild! I would play G2 instead. The difference is very important!]
;W[jo]
(;B[cn];W[in];B[go]C[Can't decide if these 2 stones were essential.  I thought if he takes them, then I would have to answer to save my three lower stones, so I should play this move.  Was I wrong?

gawron: Well, if you think the stones were importnant, why did you capture instead of playing J6 yourself ??!!!]
;W[kp]C[Now I tried to evaluate the whole board here.  Since he lost the 4 stones, I think I am ahead and that group is alive and strong.  How should I use that group to dominate in the game?  I saw his   2 weak stones at k16 and k14 as the biggest target.   But the outcome of the game is that I steadily lose my advantage and lose by 12.5 points.

gawron: The game got much easier for you since white made a huge mistake, but you also made some bad moves before and you didn't take the full advantage of white's mistake. The outcome of the game depends on wether white makes use of his moyo in the lower right center and how effectively you can attack white K14/K16. 

I think the key for attacking them are the clamp at J14 or the hane at K17.]

(;B[ef]C[gawron: This is bad - the hane at E13 gives white excellent shape (and sente to move with his weak stones).]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[ig]C[gawron: Now white is attacking black ... Your stones won't die, but with this weak black group it will be easy for white to turn much of his moyo into territory.]
;B[kh];W[mh];B[gg];W[ii];B[jc];W[id];B[ic];W[gh]C[His weak group has connected but I did make some profit on the upper side.

gawron: But what about white's moyo? It's very urgent to reduce it!]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[hd];W[ng];B[qj];W[ki];B[rm]C[gawron: Wrong direction! White is threatining to make quite some points in the center! This is not the time to grab points on the second row. J8 and P10 are important moves now.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qe];B[re];W[pd];B[rd];W[pk]C[Now his chance to win is to make points in the center.  Not sure how to foil his plan.

gawron: I could also say: Black just the lead by allowing both L11 and Q9!]
;B[pm];W[qk];B[rk];W[rl];B[ql];W[rj];B[sl];W[qi];B[qb];W[rh]

(;B[pe]C[gawron: Is this still necessary? Your upper right group is alive as it stands, so you should not take points in gote but play O7!]
;W[oe];B[qf];W[pb]
(;B[pc]C[This must have been a big mistake.  I felt unsure about this group, but I should have played S5?  The upper goups has a miai in s18 and s13.

gawron: I think the mistake was Q15.
If you play tenuki now, white can start a ko with S18 (see variation).]
;W[ro]C[Well now I gave myself a weak group.

gawron: Yes, you must be very careful now.
Neither R6 nor Q8 seem to work. You can connect by playing S6, but white could then Q7.]

;B[qn];W[pl]C[gawron: white could also try harder and play S6. maybe he had counted that he could win without killing the whole group.]
;B[rn];W[ol]C[Now looking not good.  I had to live and I sacrificed the move to the center from this group.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[nc];W[pd];B[qc];W[ob];B[mc];W[od]C[Do you think I did well here?  I tenuki now and go somewhere else.

gawron: I don't see how you could have got more points in the upper right.]
;B[il]C[gawron: Yes, this is big.];W[dj]C[I was very unsure about the approach to take here.  And I did lose the area badly.
gawron: I think you lost the game here.]
(;B[ci]C[gawron: Oops. This is quite an overplay. If you want to connect, E11 is better.]

;W[gk]C[Thought I could cut my way out but to no avail.  Unless B18 would still put up a fight?

gawron: Well, white is alive even if you play B18. Your group is dead, so the game is over.]

gawron: Yes, this move is big.];B[bl];W[ak];B[so]C[gawron: This is move is small and creates bad aji in the corner. T4 would have been better locally.]
