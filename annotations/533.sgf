C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I'm not certain
what my biggest problem is, either in general or in this game
in particular, but I can think of two that came up in this game:

1) I often have difficulty what part of the board I should be
playing in in the first place, never mind figuring out which
point in that part of the board is the correct one on which to
play.

2) Whenever I try to attack, I only seem to make my opponent
stronger.  In this game, my opponent seemed to have no problem
completing a large framework.

result for black but see variation for one possibility];W[eo]
C[zoz:White should have played E4];B[do];W[jp];B[pd]C[Fedya: Here I figured that since I was sente, I'd play in the
remaining corner.  I thought I came out ahead in this exchange.

zoz: not bad for black but maybe Q5 in response to K4 is better
than q16 since top right corner is still open];W[po];B[mq];W[pj]

LB[cf:a]C[Fedya: Does it make a difference here whether I attack from the
right or from below, at C14?];W[cg];B[ic];W[ck];B[cm]C[Fedya: I think my stones here are heavy.  But I'm not certain
where I went wrong in the lower left.  Clearly, White has more
potential on the left side.];W[ep]
(;B[dp]C[D4 is solid but something like D18 or even n5 is better]
;W[dc];B[fe]SQ[ci][pm][mo][qp]C[This is not a good respone since you are reasonably stable and
you are not building too much territory by playing F15. A better
move at this point is Q7 or N5 or C11 or simply R4];W[qq]C[Fedya: In the following sequence, White seems to have no problem
reducing my territory greatly while building a great framework.
Since I had played first in this corner, I should have been able
to come out with an equal position.  Where did I go wrong?

See variation.]

(;B[hr]LB[ko:a]C[Fedya: Should I have played at G2 or H3 instead in this area?

Or, should I have played at L5?  I know that in general, a move
like L5 is good for disturbing eye shape, but I rejected L5 because
of the stone at K4.  I figured the K4 stone would allow White
to build a net of some sort to capture a Black group at L5.

zoz: H2 is not necessary since you already have K2. You now should
play a reduction move. See variation for possible reduction moves.]
;W[hp];B[en];W[ek];B[fn]C[Fedya: I think this move is too slow.  In light of White's next
move, I should probably have played in the top right.  I didn't
realise just how big a move it was until after White played there.

zoz: I like F6! It sets up an invation at p8];W[rd];B[qc];W[qe]

(;B[rc]LB[ol:C][dg:B][of:A]C[zoz: too early to play s17. I like A, B, C instead. Maybe C is
most important];W[ld];B[lc]C[Fedya: I think I should have played off here -- at L18.  In that
case I'd still be able to connect the two groups and save a good
deal of territory.];W[kc];B[mc];W[kd];B[ef]SQ[nf][ie]C[Fedya: I didn't think I could play L18 here (but eventually tried
anyhow), so I decided to try something else.  To be truly honest,
however, I really don't have any idea where I should have played
in this position.  Anything would have been a wild guess.

zoz: E14 only helps w. Just play a simple move like J14 or O14
(I like J15 since it helps G17 and attacks white.];W[df];B[kb]
C[There is no connection there so you should not try it!];W[jb]
;B[lb];W[jc];B[ib];W[ja];B[ia];W[ie];B[fp]C[Fedya: Is this move a waste of time?  I thought at the time I
played it that it would reduce White, but now I don't think it
does much of anything.  Perhaps I should have played H6 instead.

zoz: not a good move at all. You still have to worry about Top
group.];W[fo];B[gq];W[gp];B[fq];W[gn];B[fl]C[Fedya: Compare this position to what the board might look like
had I played at H6.];W[gf];B[ge];W[he];B[hd];W[id];B[hc];W[eg]
;B[de];W[ce];B[ee];W[ff];B[rl]C[Fedya: I felt like I was far behind, and needed to do *something*
to reduce White's territory.  This looked like the best place
for me to try.  I figured that I'd be able to make a two-point
jump, plus either a jump to the side or out into the center.

It turned out in the game that the invasion survived, but at
a cost of allowing White a surprisingly large amount of territory
in the center.

zoz: this invation is too low. You need O10 at this point in
the game.];W[pl];B[ri];W[qi];B[rj];W[rh];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn];W[qn]
;B[qm];W[pm];B[ql];W[rp];B[qj];W[pi];B[ne]C[Fedya: I figured here that the invasion would survive, so I had
the opportunity to use sente to do something.  The only problem
is, I have no idea exactly *what* I should do with sente in this
position.

zoz: this is ok];W[qk];B[rk];W[pk]C[zoz: now you should have played in the center of play o13 or
F7]
(;B[qd];W[re];B[ng]C[zoz:good];W[ni];B[hl]C[zoz:maybe G7 is better (see variation)]

(;W[jl];B[im]C[Fedya: Should I have been extending toward the center instead?

zoz: this is good. but cut still there.];W[jm];B[hj];W[jj];B[io]
;W[ip];B[hh];W[hg]
(;B[ih]TR[kf][ne][ng]SQ[ei]C[Fedya: I think this is another mistake.  I should probably have
played at K12 instead, which might have allowed me to reduce
White's territory somewhat more.

zoz: maybe e11, k12 is open at k14 as an extension fo the two
marked stones, See variations to E11];W[jo]C[zoz: J6 is too small.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[kh];W[ki]
(;B[ig]C[Fedya: As it turned out, I still had chances to make life difficult
for White.  I probably should have been doing something on the
left side of the board, but I couldn't figure out what.  My guess
is that right now, F12 wouldn't be so bad.

zoz: J13 is too small, you still have E11. Maybe a dan player
have a strong response to E11 but I do not see a good response
for white except to play defensive. See variation];W[gh];B[gi]
;W[fh]
(;B[if]C[Fedya: And I make matters worse by not playing at F11!]
;W[hf];B[fj];W[ej]C[Fedya: Now that White has more or less completed all his framework,
there's not much left to comment on.  The rest of the game consists
mostly of endgame-type moves.];B[eb];W[db];B[da];W[ca];B[ea]
