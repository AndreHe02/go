C[Hey Bob,

I agree, it seemed as though you were focusing too much on the local matters a lot of the time. I think it's a good idea to think about how your local moves will affect your other groups every time you put something down. Also, I think another thing for you to keep in mind is that you don't have to save every stone you put down - in the middle game you would keep on adding and adding to your weak groups and they became too large to sacrifice.

Anyways, my comments are given throughout the game. Feel free to contact me at etrynus@gmail.com (not the address I'm sending this to you from) if you have any additional questions or if you disagree with some of my comments (I'm bound to be wrong somewhere =P).

Thanks for the interesting game.

Regards,
John

Hi:

This is a game I played as White. I won by a few points, but only by starting a ko near the end where I was able to exchange a smaller group for a larger one - otherwise I would have lost by a few points. In general, it seemed like a pretty even game throughout.

The whole game seemed to be fighting, which makes me suspect that I'm missing the "strategic" points at which I could make my overall position stronger. Spending a whole game fighting - when playing someone my own level - seems kind of like flipping a coin; neither of us can predict far enough ahead to really know what's coming, and to really be able to claim to be in control of the game.

So I'd be interested in better understanding the strategic view of this game and the missed opportunities for development.

Thanks,

(;W[op]C[see variation];B[qp]C[B now has the corner and W's influence in the middle is flimsy.

One way to easily tell that B has the advantage here is by looking at how the already placed stones work together. Each B stone is performing some function. W's R3 stone, however, is pretty useless.

When you played P4, you should have pictured that B would respond with R4 and then looked for a better move.]
;W[oq]C[I think I would have tenuki'd here. Something like D10 or R10 feels a lot better.

With P3, W is becoming heavy. That means that W is investing too much into his lower right group and now it will be more painful to sacrifice it later on if need be. The group can now become a liability rather than an asset.]
;B[qo]C[B should defend with P2 here. That way W's group in the middle will still be on the defensive.]
;W[or];B[lq];W[pn];B[qm]C[B should extend one more at R6 before jumping. W takes advantage nicely in the next couple of moves.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[ro];B[rp];W[rm];B[so];W[ql];B[pr];W[gq]C[G3 is ok but remember to keep your eye on the R7 ladder. Those things always cause trouble later on.]
;B[go]C[Overplay by B.];W[hp];B[fp]C[Continued overplay.];W[fq]
C[This time I would rather start the fight by continuing to pressure the K3 group (I haven't read everything through but K5 seems like a good continuation).

If you continue with K5 there is no way B can block off F3 and prevent your new group from getting to the middle at the same time.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[cp]C[Unless this is some joseki I'm not familiar with B's play is a little erratic.]
;W[dq];B[co];W[jo];B[ko];W[kp];B[lp]
(;W[jp]C[Errr why not M5?];B[lo];W[nn]C[In this specific situation I'd prefer O7 because it helps with the ladder problem and prevents B O6 at the same time.]
;B[km];W[jn]C[Really really slow. B is out already.

It feels like you are wasting a move just to set up a fight. If you want to start avoid games totally fight-oriented I would start by reflecting on why you played this move.]
;B[dm]
(;W[kn]C[This is an important tip that will have applications in every game you play:

Attack not to kill, but to build yourself up. If you can attack from more than one side, attack from your weakest side.

In this case, your weaker side is your O6 group, since your K4 group is almost guaranteed life. By moving L6, you are forcing the fight over to your weaker side, which you will soon regret. On the other hand, if you attack from your weaker side and the fight spills to your stronger side, your stronger side will be able to take the abuse.

If you look at the variation, you can see a good example of attacking from your weaker side. N8 both strengthens your weaker side and forces B to make a defensive move.]

;B[nk];W[jl];B[pj];W[ok]C[Wow you are nowhere near strong enough to fight! Do something like R10 to secure yourself.]
;B[oj];W[nj]C[This move and the last were huge overplay.];B[mj]
;W[ni];B[mk];W[lk];B[mi];W[nh]C[Now you have created a weak floating group for yourself.

Perhaps a better plan for W would be to forget about those two stones and move elsewhere.]
;B[ph];W[mh]
(;B[ki];W[lh]C[Again this is really heavy. W is losing the ability to sacrifice the group without much loss.

I would have probably jumped to O16 or O17, or tenuki'd.]
(;B[kj];W[kh];B[ii]C[B K9 sente would be pretty good.];W[jh]
C[This is getting pretty nasty =(];B[ik]C[I think W managed to not get off too badly from this sequence because B was too scared of losing his group and kept of making small jumps out. B should have really put pressure on the floating W group (see variation from moves 74 and 76).]
;W[md];B[mb];W[od];B[pc];W[pf];B[og];W[pe]C[I like P14 a lot better. It's one of those shape things.]
;B[qg]
(;W[pg]C[You really need to be attacking the middle right B group with something like S14. What W ends up doing feels like giving up.]
;B[qf];W[oh];B[qh]C[B should cruise to a victory here.];W[cj]
;B[cg];W[cd]C[Why??? Is D16 in any danger?  W needs to protect the new C10 group.]

;B[ek];W[cn];B[do];W[bo];B[bj];W[fo]C[Purpose?];B[fn]C[Purpose? B should take his sente at B4.]
;W[gp]C[Yeah, so from here on out you guys make a lot of endgame style mistakes by making really small moves when there are much larger points on the board.]
;B[gn];W[ih]C[Slow.];B[gi]C[Slow, and H12 is better anyways.]
;W[ji];B[jj]C[K9 sente.];W[hi];B[im]C[Bad sente to take because it removes the aji from the L7 stone.]
;W[jm];B[gj];W[il];B[hk];W[hl]C[G17 is a lot bigger than this stuff.

L3 is pretty decent too.];B[gl];W[ij];B[jk];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb]

;B[nb];W[la];B[id];W[kc];B[je]C[K14 better for eye building. Also B has sente at M16.

Comments end here.

To both: your endgames are pretty awful! It is probably your easiest place to improve. Just take a couple of seconds to look around the board before making 1-2 point moves.]
