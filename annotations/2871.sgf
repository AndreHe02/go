C[Llywelyn: To say that I lost this game is an understatement.  Thanks for any help you can give me in this!

Munisai:  Hi!  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to look at your game.  I'll proceed any comments with "M:" and as always, take my comments with a healthy dose of skepticism.  

M:  In summary:
1.  Study life and death problems daily.  This game featured some heavy fighting and black spent some crucial moves defending unnecessarily (moves 29 and 87/89, for example).  
2.  Take care of weak groups first.  For example, move 39 allowed white to undercut black and was too loosely connected to the original group.  
3.  Split your opponent whenever possible and don't let yourself get split.]

C[M:  This move is usually played if white has support around J17 (triangle).


M:  A pincer, the kosumi D15, or the knight's move D14 are other options (circles).]
;B[ed];W[od];B[pf]
(;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[kc]C[M:  Now black must defend the E16 stones.  If he doesn't, white's extensi
on to H17 is a solid attack.])
(;W[ld]CR[ic]TR[qc]C[M:  Joseki is R17 (triangle).  The move played invites black to complete a base on the top with a move at J17 (circle).

M:  I think J17 is fairly urgent for black.  Without it, black is heavy and will have to run if white attacks.  However, M16 is not especially supportive of an attack, so I think white would have been better served following the joseki (shown).]
;B[pi]C[M:  This move is not especially urgent.  M16 was not an attack on the black stones, as black still has the option to either take the corner or extend down the side.]
;W[qc];B[pd]C[M:  S17 is standard.];W[pc]C[ M:  This leaves black with bad shape.  S17 is better because it takes more of the corner and leaves black with a stronger shape.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[pm];W[pk];B[qj];W[pl]C[M:  White's objective is to get out to the center.  This move invites black to make that more difficult.]
;B[om];W[rk];B[rj];W[rd]C[M:  White is taking advantage of black's shape.  S15 is a possible response (instead of R15).]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[oe]TR[ic][df][nk][jq]C[M:  White should play elsewhere.  This does not require a response from black.  J17, D14, and K3 are all big points.  White can also escape with O9.]
;B[pe]C[M:  Before making a move, try to figure out what your opponent wants to accomplish.  
1)  White Q15 isn't a threat, since you can connect at R14.  
2)  White P14 starts to enclose your group.  

Therefore, if black wishes to respond locally, P14 is good.  More widely, J17 is still important.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[oi]C[M:  White is threatening to connect to the stones at Q9.  If those stones are connected or escape out, then black's group will be completely shut in, and white will have a large amount of center influence at a very small cost -- just 8 or 9 points.  Black is playing a catch up game now and needs to make some big plays.]
;B[fq];W[kq];B[iq]TR[ic][cj][cn]C[ M:  Don't press the issue so early.  L3 does not attack the stone at F3.  J17 is still urgent, and the second kakari at C6 or the splitting move at C10 both look interesting.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[er];B[dn]CR[fq][iq]TR[ec][ed]C[M:  E2 should be responded to.  F2 is solid.  Jumping out to put pressure on the white group at L3 is also an option. 

M:  At a higher level, avoid making weak groups. Black already has two groups that need attention, and since white can split the D6 stone from the stone at F3, it will need attention, too.]
;W[fr]C[M:  White has cut undercut black's base.  To make eyes, black has to run to the center.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fo]TR[do]C[M:  In general, split your opponent's stones whenever possible.  D5 still leads to a hard fight in this case, since black does not have the ladder and is split into two weak groups, too.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[do];B[en];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn]C[M:  White has done a great job splitting up the black groups.]

[dl][el][pl][ql][dm][em][fm][gm][im][dn][en][in][io][iq]C[M:  Don't lose yourself in fighting.  At every move, consider your opponent's move and decide if it demands a response.  If it doesn't, take a step back and look at the whole board.  

M:  Black has three very weak groups and 24 (fairly) sure points.  White has two weak groups and more than 50 (fairly) sure points.  To have any chance of winning, black needs to strengthen several of his groups.  Moves like L7 or F11 are interesting because they strengthen weak groups while attacking white.]

;B[fj]TR[fi][gi][fk][gk]C[M:  Not necessary.  The bamboo joint cannot be cut and black already has a sure eye at F10 or G10.]
;W[hh];B[hj];W[ef];B[hd]C[M:  Black should consider playing on the third line for safety here.  This group needs eyes, and a stone on the fourth line can be undercut.]

(;B[dj]TR[fk][gk][co]C[M:  This has some very interesting continuations.  White has to beware of the cut at C5, and black is likely to sacrifice the stones at F9.]
