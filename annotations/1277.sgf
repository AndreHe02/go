C[Special help needed with opening and defense against invasions.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[ed]C[OK,
this move always gets to me!  I always feel I should be doing something about
it, but I don't know what.];B[pn]LB[pj:a][cj:b][jc:c][cd:d]
C[looks not as large as some other points, that I've indicated with letter (can you see the letters on the board ?)]
;W[jq];B[nd]LB[qj:a][jc:b][cj:c][cd:d]C[Is this sensible under the circumstances?  I really need help with my opening!

A general rule is corner, then side, then middle.  The 4-4 points take care of the corner, so the points left are challenging the remaining corner and the side points, so I still think the lettered places are larger.]
;W[dj];B[cc]LB[ce:a][cd:b]C[This can't be good, maybe I should have played D3?

Maybe  "b" is better, since if w answers C17 at "a" w gets big territory along the side.]
;W[cd];B[ec]LB[dd:a][de:b][dc:c][fd:d]C[Was this also a mistake?

w getting big territory on side while b getting less.  Instead of E17, how about wedging in at "a" .  If w then atari's at "b", b connects at "c", and instead if w atari's at "c", b comes out at "b" which threatens to play "d" and capture a stone in a ladder which gives b a nice territory at the top.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[dd];B[fc]LB[bb:a]C[w getting more than b here.  Instead of F17, how about "a" .]
;W[cb];B[ic]C[I
felt that I had messed up my invasion, but should at least try to get something
for it, maybe try and connect to my stones at the top right corner.]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[fp]C[In
retrospect, I don't like this move.  Should it maybe have been at H3?  Or
should I have kept up the pressure on the white invasion at R11?]
;W[eq];B[fq]C[OK,
yes, I know that I don't want to be in this situation, as K3 is already there.
 How should I have avoided this?];W[dn];B[iq]LB[lq:a][jo:b]
[fn:c]C[Don't contact the stone you want to attack.  Play "a" instead.  If w jumps out to "b", b jumps to "c" gradually reducing w's moyo while attacking.  Also note how "a" starts to make even more territory for b.]
;W[ip]C[this way w getting stronger and b getting weaker];B[hq]
;W[jp];B[mq];W[hp]C[now b is on the run and w middle stones stronger.]
;B[fr]LB[gp:a]C[how about "a" instead to reduce some of w's liberties while maintaining fighting stance and preventing w force of his own at "a"]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[fo]C[b being pushed around, w making center territory]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[ge]C[w making large center.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[do];B[pi]LB[oi:a]C[Same mistake again.  Don't contact the stones you want to attack !  Play "a" instead.]
;W[ph]LB[qj:a][rk:b]C[as w, I would have answered at "a" instead of Q12, aiming at "b" after that.]
;B[pj];W[oh];B[rh];W[ri]LB[qh:a][rf:b][rg:c]C[for w, I'd answer at "a" instead of S11.  Then if b plays "b", w can answer at "c" and b has to defend.]
;B[rf];W[qh];B[rg];W[nj];B[ok]LB[oi:a][ni:b][nh:c]C[the b stones are already strong so don't cower with P9.  Instead, push with "a" and if w blocks with "b", then b can cut with "c" .  w shouldn't have played N10.  I think N12 would be much more safe for w.]
;W[nk];B[oi];W[ni];B[nh]LB[ng:a][mh:b][mg:c]C[now it may be too late for the cut.  w has more liberties, so w can atari at "a" and if b plays "b" w chases with "c".]
;W[nf];B[mg]LB[mh:a]C[as b I'd prefer "a" so w doesn't have forcing atari's to work with.]
;W[me];B[lc]LB[lf:a]C[b got confused.  The top is strong so why defend at M17 .  The weak stones are the N13 and O12 ones.  b should strengthen those ones, which sets up attack on either o's O11 group or o's top stones.  So instead of M17, I perhaps like b "a" .]
;W[ke]C[now w strong and b almost dead in center.];B[lf];W[le]

;B[hg];W[hh];B[gg];W[fh]LB[fg:a][ff:b][ef:c]C[w let b off the hook.  How about if w plays "a" instead.  if b answers at "b" w looks strong enough to play "c".  w getting way too big now.]
;B[ff];W[dg];B[df];W[cg]LB[eg:a]C[w being too passive.  For one thing, w can play "a" instead of C13.]
;B[ef];W[cf]
