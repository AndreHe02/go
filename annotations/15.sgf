C[no2k: In my opinion there were 2 decisive moves, which i did not know how to handle. The first one was the 77th move, when black reduced my moyo relative deep. The second one was the 93th move, when i was not able to connect my center group to the left. After a slight joseki error in the beginning i felt good. Was this feeling ok? Every comment is welcome.]

;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[cj];W[nc];B[kc];W[qf]C[no2k: i am trying to erase influence.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[pb]LB[qe:A]C[no2k: Better to play at a first?
perbs: In this situation playing either R15 or R17 is normal. Q18 is to low.]
;B[qe];W[ld];B[qg];W[qh]C[perbs: This move is to early. If white get's to play R17 at a later point in the game S14 is another move to consider instead of R12.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[lc];W[qf];B[md]C[perbs: Good move by black.The right side is not important yet.]
;W[re];B[qg];W[qc]LB[cl:A][cd:B]C[no2k: Should i have played at A or B?
perbs: No. You had to play R17 to make your corner alive.];B[qf]
;W[ph];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]TR[kc][lc][md][nd][of][pf]C[no2k: My corner group is not quite secure. But blacks has gotten a lot of influence with the marked stones.]
;W[di];B[dj];W[ei]LB[ci:A][ei:B]C[no2k: I didn't want to play at A because of black B. Is this right?
perbs: Yes it is correct. B is the normal move here.];B[ci]
LB[bh:A]C[no2k: I expected this move at A. There it would have been better?
perbs: Black can play both moves. The normal move is at A, but since black has a stone at L17 he can play C11.]
;W[ch]C[perbs: Since the ladder is good for black white can't play here. White has to play at D13.]
;B[df];W[ej]C[perbs: White has to protect the cut at C12.];B[dh]
;W[dg]TR[di][ei][ej]C[no2k: I decided to give up the 3 white stones, if it is necessary.]
;B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[cf];B[ce];W[ef];B[de];W[bg]C[no2k: I did not have black connected underneath. But this move seemed slow to me. Is there an alternative?

perbs: If white omits B13 black can't connect. White could try to fight with either E9, G17 or G10. No matter how white move the fight looks very difficult.]
;B[ek];W[fd];B[ec];W[fc];B[fb];W[be];B[bd];W[ad]C[no2k: a misreading.]
;B[ac];W[ae];B[cc];W[bi];B[fj];W[op];B[mq];W[mo]C[perbs: Not a bad move but playing R3 making territorie while attacking looks better.]
;B[pq];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq];B[np];W[no];B[jq];W[mi]LB[nk:A]C[no2k: Too gready? Better somewhere around A?

perbs: black is very strong in the center. White should either play P9 to secure points, or N12 allowing black to invade, but white to erase black's center.
I would probaly play P9.];B[ml]C[no2k: That is the decisive point. I thought a long time about my response. After counting i felt it would be good enough to defend first.]

C[perbs: Correct direction but bad shape. Black can cut at G14. H14 is solid.]
;B[jg]C[no2k: Good move, i think. During the game i thought, that i am able to connect in spite of that move. But how?

perbs: See variation 3]
(;W[ji]LB[jh:A]C[no2k: Perhaps better at A. Attaching to make me stronger?]
