C[Dear reviewer,

I played this with Black on the KGS server.
The game is a mystery I can't solve. In move 86  when I felt like winning, White played the
Sabaki invasion at E8 which I still don't know how to handle. Seems the two white stones were
stronger than my 5 stones at the bottom plus my enclosing framework. I lost a group and the
game, but all other variations I analyzed seem to end up with White ahead as well.

The file was messy with variations, so I've removed most of them. Hopefully, you got some better ideas.
I'd also like your comments on the opening.

Many  thanks !
Christoph];B[dp];W[qp];B[dd];W[pd];B[cj]C[olaf: a littlebit uncommon because it contradictes the idea of influence (already 2 hoshis) a little.]

(;W[fc];B[id]C[I play this move to keep the upper side from becoming white, but my continuation may
be to blame for the result.
olaf: i think the move isn't bad, but for the reason to build up a wall in the center rather than preventing white territory at the top.]

(;B[hq]C[This H3 is an "extension and a pincer", usually receiving excellent marks in the opening books, but...
olaf: the exellent remarks are for extensions from strong positions and a pincer. Here you have to look after a pincer which strengthen your position on the right a bit more. I would play J3. In the game you have weak points around N3 and K3.]

(;B[ej]C[olaf: localy not bad, but isn't it a pitty that you wish to play here? What if C10 stands at D10? Than the moyo would be perfect without a second play. Due to this second play you didn't find the time to protect the weaknesses on the bottom. :-(]

(;B[mp]C[After so many moves in that area, the white stone's aji should be taken care of
and there ought to be time to play this N4. But wait until White plays E8...

olaf: So you are aware of the defects in the position. That should have been a hint that E10 isn't as big as it looks first.]
