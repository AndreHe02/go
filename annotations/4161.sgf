C[Dear reviewer,

I played this game as White. I chose to submit the game for review because I think it fairly representative of the games I play - things get settled fairly quickly and then it is a slow grind to the finish. Do I need to be more 'light' with my groups?

Otherwise I've made a lot of comments and questions throughout on what I think about my own moves, so please tell me if there is anything wrong about my train of thought.

Thanks a lot,
John

Hi John, this is an interesting game.  It started calmly. As usual in such game small mistakes accumulated to affect the outcome.  I will review for both sides.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[How to respond to this? My answer probably the slow answer =/.

Jay: What you did was fine, but a bit slow, as you mentioned. W could also choose to tenuki and play the right side. W doesn't want B to develop a moyo there.]

(;W[dr];B[fc];W[hc]C[B seems to be building a moyo. Maybe I can build a wall to counter it?

Jay: Right thinking.];B[cc]C[Jay: B is not consistent here.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[ce]C[Jay: Not a joseki move.  C14 jump is.]

(;W[eg]C[Jay: Not correct.];B[cg]TR[eg]C[Jay: the marked exchange made up B's mistake one move earlier.]
;W[nc]C[Right direction?

Jay: This is ok.];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ld];B[fo];W[qn];B[np]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qk];B[qi]C[Maybe I shouldn't have chosen the joseki I did since it gave B this fine move?

Jay: This is fine for W.  The game has developed into a slow stable game up to this point. B has not played consistently, especially the UL corner, and F5 move is a bit slow.  The game is a little better for W at this point.]

(;W[em]TR[cg]C[I had no idea what to do here. Seems like the board reached a steady state.

My plan with this was to start building a framework on the left with this move and the next.

Jay: This is a wrong direction for W. B has the marked stone, thus the potential on the left is not great for W.]
;B[er]C[Necessary to respond to this?

Jay: W usually has to respond to this move, but the problem is that if W responded, then E7 stone would appear poorly positioned, too close to the LL corner and over concentrated.  This shows that the previous W move was not so good, better played at D10 or D11. As in the game, W left weakness in the corner.]
;W[ci]
(;B[bi]C[Jay: This move is slow.  B should invade the corner now, or attack W's right weak group.]
;W[bj];B[bh]
(;W[cj]C[Jay: This W move is not needed.  Too slow.];B[kd]C[Jay: W gave B a change to catch up here.]

(;W[ke]C[Jay: This W move is overplay.];B[le];W[je];B[md];W[lc]
;B[mc];W[me]C[Jay: W was too greedy here.  But, B didn't capitalize on W's mistake.]

(;B[ne]C[Jay: wrong move for B.];W[lf];B[nd];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb]
;B[oc]C[Jay: The result still favors B somewhat, because B gets a big corner, and W's top is not much a compensation.]
;W[rq]C[How slow is this?

Jay: almost necessary now.];B[cr]C[Jay: Now it's payback time for W in the LL corner.  C3 may be better though, but this is sufficient for B.]
;W[ds];B[dq]C[Jay: B should still play C3.];W[cq];B[eq]
(;W[cp]C[B2 a lot better? I was probably seeing things that weren't there.

Jay:  Playing B2 is ok to protect the corner.  You will have to give up D4 stone and leave some aji for the left moyo in gote.  But the game is a little worse to lose some points in the corner.]

;B[pk];W[pl];B[ol];W[ql];B[ok]LB[om:A]C[Jay: Better to connect at A. This side is to emphasize the upper right side. The lower right side has some weaknesses. The right side is less promising for both sides. 

It's time to do counting: B has about 50 pts, while W has 43 pts. W has a slightly bigger moyo than B's Thus, the game is very close, but W is still slightly behind despite the successful invasion at the bottom.  The center is urgent right now. I would play to build the center.]

(;W[nf]C[I dunno about this one.

Jay: It's a big endgame point, but slow to play now, it's not building any center potential. The center is now important, because B is thick everywhere.]

(;B[of]C[Jay: B should not respond to this move.  Definitely should go into the center.]
;W[jj]C[Jay: Good.]
(;B[kh]TR[nf][of]C[Jay: Seems a wrong invasion point.  Too close the W's strong wall.  This made the marked exchange good for W.]
;W[mh];B[li];W[jh]
(;B[jg]C[Jay: This is again a bit single minded for B.]

(;W[oh]C[Jay: This is slow . Bigger moves are S10, B3, and G2, and J8. and even R2. Out of these, the sente moves are S10 and B3.  B3 is sente only for W, though, as shown in a later variation, while S10 is sente for both sides. So, S10 is the obvious move for W now.  The current W move could be treated as a losing move if W would lose in the end.]

;B[po];W[pn];B[ng];W[mg];B[mi];W[nh];B[mf];W[bq]C[Jay: Big. reversal sente (8pt.).  This also has excellent follow up move for W by playing G2 to attack the E3 B group. See later variation.]
;B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[ck];B[il];W[hm];B[rr]C[Jay: This is a big point, but smaller than H2.]

(;B[ho]C[Jay: This is a losing move for B.  No need for B to be provocative here.  B should just connect the ko, since B is winning (very slightly, despite some small mistakes in the end). B doesn't have enough ko threats and most of these are point losing threats; and what's worse, this is a fatal ko for B and unconsequential for W (B only gains 1 pts.). In fact, B lost the game by losing this ko.  Sad game for B.]
;W[ms];B[if];W[jf];B[ls];W[qp];B[pq]C[Jay: B further loses points in the ko fight.  Not worth it.  Instead of fighting the ko, B is better to simple connect at R4 earlier.  See the variation before the last one to illustrate this.]

Hope that this review helps to clarify the game for you. Thanks for presenting this interesting game.]
