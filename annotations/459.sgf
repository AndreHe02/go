C[I'm Rubus and playing Black. I'm 18k and Oxygen 17k on NNGS. I'm not used to play without handicap. Where should I start to play?

*thinking* Well... 4-4 point maybe   :o)];B[pd]C[vlkplk: For first move of ("live") game, it's polite to play at white's left hand part of board. That is, somwhere inside the K10, K19, T19 triangle. However, it's supposed to be rude to place first stone directly at K10 (tengen).]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]C[Here I was thinking if I should secure my corner or attack white's corner. I choose to secure on my base.

vlkplk: Almost anything is good. It's matter of taste. My favorite is K16, which makes strong position. Non-conservative move would be at K10.]

(;B[fc]C[vlkplk: This move is usualy played as response for whites attack at C14. I don't know about josekis so much, but I doubt its useful. The reason is that it does not secure corner - consider white's move at C16. But maybe even it's not a large scale move, it's alright. See some book about joseki (but I didn't find this move among basic josekis).]

(;W[cf]C[vlkplk: To respond for this white's move, I would choose C16. It is a simple move, secures corner, Doesn't leave any room for white to do something later in corner and leaves white to decide what to do to help his stone at C14. See variations .]

(;B[ce]C[vlkplk: Instead of this move, see previous variations. This moves is played usualy when black has no stone at F17. When you play contact move like this, inspite of makeing yourself strong, you help oponnent to strengthten him self as well.]
;W[be]C[vlkplk: Now black can switch like in variation. Don't allow white to take initiative.]

(;B[bd];W[ae];B[ad];W[bg];B[df];W[dg]
(;B[ef]C[vlkplk: Seems you fall a bit under white's intention - see previous variation.]
;W[eg]C[vlkplk: See variation !]
(;B[nc];W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[se];B[sd];W[rg];B[pf];W[pg]
C[vlkplk: Same as before ... Maybe even more urgent.]
(;B[of];W[og]C[Not so pleased with the result. It looks hard on the bottom. So I try to attack...

vlkplk: In both upper shapes there is serious weakness. If white gets to haneh there on head of two black stones, it's generaly considered to be bad for black (as you see later). You should go ahead a little bit as in variation.]

(;B[cn]C[vlkplk: I don't like this kind of moves. It allows to white to push you against his strength, where you are not going to have chance of making any damage. Considering symetry, maybe move at K3 or K4 would be good.]
;W[dn]C[This surprised me...

vlkplk: It's right move, I think.];B[cp]C[vlkplk: Apropriate response.]
;W[gp]C[vlkplk: Now descending is good, I think. The reason is: safety for black group and later may come in hand on lower side. Don't make so strict moves as next one so often.]

(;B[dq];W[eq];B[dr]C[vlkplk: Maybe white had to play D5 first.]

(;W[er];B[do];W[ep];B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[eo];B[co]C[vlkplk: This sequence, even black has made some damage on right side, ends in blacks got eh. This is VERY important now. White has free hands to: secure his right side/central territory or make moves at F14 or O14. But one thing should be prized: this sequence makes white stone at F4 almost useless. In situation when black has already made something on right/lower side, this sequence would be advantage for black, I think.]
;W[fm]C[Looks good there... But how do I get through white's wall?

vlkplk: Yours next move is right. Then try something inside whites moyo (but this is question what exactly). See variations.]

(;B[fl]C[vlkplk: Good move. Black tries to diminish whites moyo making use of his strong position on left side.]
;W[el]C[vlkplk: Natural move.];B[gm]C[vlkplk: Good.];W[fn];B[dl]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[dj]C[vlkplk: Now consider weakness of black three stones. See variation .]

(;B[dk];W[ej]C[Feels like a problem. What do I do with my stones on the outside?

vlkplk: Now black has better to abandone these stones. And hope they will come in use later. If you really want to protect them, then you have to spend one move and play something like in variations .]

(;B[cj]C[vlkplk: How much gives you moves like this ?];W[ci]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[fj];W[ck]C[Hmmm... I felt secure...

vlkplk: Actualy, black seems secure. See variation. What is important, he wants to use moves like E11 or F11 and try to connect...]

(;B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[aj]C[vlkplk: Now black central group has hard life.]
;B[al]C[vlkplk: No use move !];W[es];B[ds]C[vlkplk: No use to defend here. Black has not so many points to lose and lives sure anyway.]
;W[gi];B[fh]C[I try to connect...

vlkplk: It's too late. During play You should give careful look at how many weak groups there are on the board. The one who has more weak groups is usualy in great disadvantage (here black has one, while whites all groups are safe.]
;W[fi];B[fg];W[eh];B[ng];W[nh]
(;B[mg]C[vlkplk: It is right move now. Variations shown before makes white strength to help his corner too much. After this, white corner is more open, so GOOD !]
;W[mh]C[vlkplk: See variations . I think the one starting with black M12 (or M13) is best.]

(;B[qn]C[vlkplk: If black can manage this stone to live and destroy enough territory of white...

BUT ! Blacks upper territory, which seems big, needs at least one more move to secure (M12 or M13). So do this move and than invade is BEST.]
;W[pn]C[vlkplk: Now, black central group cannot be rescued.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[pq]C[Mistake... Guess I should play R5.

vlkplk: Maybe a mistake.];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp]C[vlkplk: Black must connect.]
