C[Dear Reviewer...

this is a game I played on IGS against a slightly stronger opponent. I lost, but not as badly as I usually do against 18k*.

I'll go through this game myself and put some comments in, but any advice you can give will be appreciated.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[I almost always play low Chinese as black.  Maybe I should learn some other standard openings.]
;W[dj];B[iq]C[patrickb: I'm not sure playing low at J3 is particularly good here. You know have three stones low on the third line. I'd be a little worried about white pressing my stones low and not getting enough compensation. Chinese openings try to balance territory and influence. It's not a *big* deal at this point, but I thought I might note my unease. :)]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[mq]C[patrickb: low again, a little too far, and not severe enough. I'd prefer P4 here, though if you want to play low, O3 is better. P4 gets you off the third line while putting more pressure on w. The white stones can now attach at P3 to try and make shape/influence. See the variation for details.]

(;W[ql]C[patrickb: w plays a thank-you move. This is just what you were looking for.]
;B[pl];W[rl];B[ok]C[patrickb: this connection is a mistake. It gives w the free push at S9. This is one of the places where it's worth connecting solidly, because it lets you resist the push in both directions.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[qn]C[patrickb: submissive by w.];B[on]C[patrickb: good. Take advantage of where w played slack]
;W[oo];B[ln]C[I was very happy with the sequence up to this point.

patrickb: *Nod* b's shape is still thin around P3, but you did get something from it.  I don't think M6 did enough. Looks a little vague to me. Perhaps just playing S4 would have been right helps strengthen against P3, and threatens w's eye-space. Drive him into the center and make territory at the bottom while he runs, perhaps?]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[mn];B[mm];W[rj]C[patrickb: w is being very generous. Push here once instead, then jump.]

(;B[qh]C[patrickb: NO! You *need* to push at S9 first.];W[qj]
C[patrickb: a w mistake, though not so bad. S9 looks better for w.]
;B[rk];W[sk];B[pk];W[pi]C[patrickb: because now w's still on the run while b builds the top right.]
;B[ph];W[oi]
(;B[oh]C[patrickb: This should be at O13 instead, threatening N11. This move just helps w into the center, and makes no attempts to get ahead in the pushing race.]
;W[mi]C[patrickb: w's jump here is a bit optimistic, but b's shape on the right, combined with the potential of the cut at M7 make it viable, I guess.]
;B[lk]C[patrickb: not a bad choice, given the cut at M7. See now why O13 was preferable to P12? Wouldn't you rather P12 be at O11 now?]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[mg];B[nf];W[lj]C[I think I gave him too much during that sequence, though.  How could I have prevented this?

patrickb: The push at P12 was the problem.];B[jd]C[Looked
 like the last really big point on the board, and a good time to grab it.

 Is this the right place for it, or should I have played closer to my stones,

or further away?

patrickb: in terms of taking the big point, it's okay. Why not play a forcing move at O10 first, BTW? It robs w of good shape... I'd be tempted to play O10, then N14, *then* this move.]
;W[fc];B[ge]C[patrickb: strange choice for a move. What was the reasoning behind this move? It doesn't really build territory on the top, since w can keep sliding to H17. It *might* help you get into the left side, but better to just go straight in at this point. Are you trying to attack w's right side group? If so, you need to get the forcing move at O10 in first, and even then it looks hard to attack w, since he can hane at L9, and you still have the thinness around P3 to worry about.]
;W[qc]C[3-3 invasion is welcome at this point... strengthens my attacking stones at K16 and G15, correct?

patrickb: Okay, so you *are* thinking that you're attacking the center w stones. I'm not sure that's realistic right now. This was a good invasion by w. There's not much territory at the top for you, since w can jump to H17, so blocking at Q17 isn't optimal, but blocking at R16 is clearly wrong, too.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]
(;B[nc]C[patrickb: at least play atari at Q19 before protecting if you're going to do this]
;W[qa];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[se];B[rf];W[sf]C[patrickb: It's only worth blocking here if you plan on attacking the w group on the right side. I'm not convinced that's a viable attack, however.]
;B[sg];W[sd];B[rh];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[ml]C[patrickb: terrible, awful, horrendous move. You just made an empty triangle when M8 is available. Why?]
;W[ll];B[lm];W[kk]C[patrickb: and now w is bulletproof, and b looks well short on territory.]
;B[gn]LB[hn:1][in:3][jn:5][ho:2][io:4][jo:6][ko:7][ip:10][jp:9]
[kp:8]C[Is this good, or should I be moving my attention back to my attack in the upper left?

patrickb: What attack in the upper left? where does w have any weak stones? I don't see any... This move does one thing - it tries to make a bigger area at the bottom. It puts a slight amount of pressure on w's left side, but w is happy to defend that at C6 right now. Say w plays C6 or F3. How much territory did you gain? Something about 10 points. His gains around the corner are worth at least as much.]
;W[fq]C[patrickb: This is fine by w, though a bit small in scale and ambition.]
;B[gq]C[patrickb: Why play this? You just reinforce w's corner for at best marginal gains. Look for opportunities to ignore your opponent's move. This is one such opportunity.]
;W[fp];B[gp]C[patrickb: You *need* to get getting into the left side. W should play there now, perhaps after pushing around N4]
;W[mp];B[lp]C[I
 have some nice territory now at the bottom and top right, but I must do something

about white's influence on the left side.

patrickb: The territory at the bottom really isn't that big. I think this move should be at M3 instead.]
;W[nq];B[nr]C[Overplay, right?

patrickb: absolutely.];W[mr];B[lq];W[or]C[patrickb: interesting double-hane if you think you're behind and want to risk things on a ko. See the variation. An overplay because the ko is difficult for b, who has a lot to lose, but I think b's behind, so it's worth considering.]

(;B[pr];W[ns]C[Now my corner is cut off and I need to make life.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rr];W[oq]C[Wasted move for white, I believe...

patrickb: yes. and a bad point to waste a move. B should go into the left side now.]
;B[mf]C[Too passive?  Maybe I should have played somewhere around D14 or G12?

patrickb: Making this exchange before going into the left side isn't terrible, but the danger is w will ignore this move. After making absolute life at the bottom right, w is in no danger with this group. Simply playing C15 would make this a *very* difficult game for b.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[dg]C[Now he's really strong.  I think I should have tried really hard to get there first.

patrickb: yes, but he has a "folding door" shape in the upper left corner. b should be able to invade it and at least get a ko.]

(;B[dn]C[Attack the weakest remaining point in white's moyo...

patrickb: this would have more force if you hadn't forced w to play F4, but is a good place to come in now, yes.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[dk]C[patrickb: force at B7 first.];W[bl]C[patrickb: good move by w.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[cl];B[dl];W[bj]
(;B[ej];W[ak]C[I
 thought about playing that point myself, but figured that both sides were

strong enough that splitting them wouldn't do much good.   Should I have?

patrickb: Yes. What does this move do? It's not making a lot of territory, and w might even be tempted to tenuki and play H17 or protect the upper left corner absolultely.]
;B[fk]C[I've

been thinking about shape more, lately.  My old style would have been to

play E11 instead of this stone, but I decided to be a little more defensive

and make shape.

patrickb: playing defensive shape where you're strong, isn't a good idea. There is some weakness around E9 that is annoying, though, so this isn't so bad. However, a bigger point is this - what is the score? If you're ahead, playing defensively makes sense. If you're behind, you have to take some chances. b has 30 points at the upper right, and about 25 or so at the bottom, as a rough guess. W has 25-30 between the bottom left, upper right, and right side, so if he makes anything more 25 from his upper left, he's ahead. So, b has to take a more aggresive stance, and *at* least play E11.]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[en];B[em]C[Good exchange for me, I believe.

patrickb: yes, certainly helps b more than w.];W[gm]C[...except...

patrickb: except what? play something simple like H6. b has one eye already, and can jump to F12 after w defends the cutting stone. You're too eager to play atari. The general guideline is to atari a stone only when you think you can capture it, or as a necessary forcing move. (though that's only a rough guideline that is frequently broken.) Here you have two different directions from which you can atari the w stone. You don't know which direction is better, so it's better to wait and decide later which atari is better.]

(;B[hm];W[gl];B[fl]C[patrickb: why play this? why not play H6 instead?]
;W[go];B[hn];W[ho]C[patrickb: and now the game really is over.]
;B[io];W[hk]
(;B[gk]C[patrickb: Again, waiting on the atari is probably better. See the variation.]
;W[hl];B[jm];W[ip];B[jp]C[patrickb: why not double-atari here?]
;W[hp];B[hq]C[Not

so great for me, since I got split up.  Could I have handled the cut better?

patrickb: this isn't terrible.];W[in]C[Obvious blunder by white...]
;B[fo];W[eo]C[patrickb: no need to respond to this. The F5 stone is small. about 3 points. Try to invade the upper left now, though it's a bit harder because of the w wall at B10.]
;B[go];W[jl];B[im];W[di]
(;B[ei]C[patrickb: what does pushing here gain? Don't push from behind against your opponent. Jump to F12 instead.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[fg]C[patrickb: see how much you're giving him? You should have jumped instead.]
;B[gh];W[gg];B[hg];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[ig];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij]
;B[gi]C[Alive,

but split up again.  Is there a way I could be handling these cuts better,

or is the problem just that I'm leaving these cutting points in the first

place?

patrickb: leaving them behind is the main problem, as is pushing against your opponent. Just extend at H12 instead of hane at H13.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[he];W[id];B[ie];W[ib];B[jc];W[jg];B[jf]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[kg];B[jb];W[hb]C[And now I've let him get too much territory in the corner.

patrickb: yes. Time to resign.];B[ef]
(;W[df]C[Mistake by white, I believe.

patrickb: I'm not so sure. W is ahead. He can give up a few stones to guarnatee his victory. There's some bad aji in the corner otherwise.]

of two useless attacks I made.  No harm done to my game, but I know it's

bad etiquette.  Need to work on my reading skills so I can avoid things like

this.

patrickb: yes. You should be able to see that this doesn't work.]
;W[ji];B[jk];W[ik];B[ki];W[kh];B[ri];W[sj];B[cm];W[bm];B[do]

;W[ad];B[eb];W[fb];B[da];W[bc];B[fa];W[ga]C[End
of the invasion, and end of the game.  Was there a way I could have made
this invasion work, or was it doomed from the start?

patrickb: It was doomed. His pass was a bit optimistic perhaps, but there was really nothing here.

Regarding the
 whole game, what were my biggest mistakes?  What strengths and weaknesses

do you see in me as a player?  If I'd attacked the upper left before he had

a chance to strengthen it at D13, would I have likely won the game, or were

there other crucial mistakes that I haven't noticed?

patrickb: You tend to push from behind against your opponent's stones, something that is almost always a bad thing to do unless you have to do it to make life for your own stones. Some of your moves were also vague and didn't have a solid purpose -play moves with a purpose. In fact, try to play moves with *multiple* purposes.

If you have more questions about this game, feel free to contact me about it. I'd be happy to go over it in person on KGS, where my login is patrickb (If you hadn't guessed by now. :) ) Overall, your game isn't bad. Just some bad habits (playing atari prematurely, pushing from behind) that you need to try to break, along with playing some more. A pleasure to review your game. Thanks for the opportunity.
