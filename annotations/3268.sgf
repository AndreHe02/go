AB[pd][dp]C[*X*: Hi, Rodney.  The GTL email said you were looking for direction of play advice.  Lucky for both of us, that's one of the stronger areas of my game.  If you were looking for expert analysis on a life and death issue or a complicated fight, I'd have a much harder time.  Anyway, my comments will be preceeded by *X*: (for "Xopods," my KGS username).

Before even looking at the game, I'd like to repeat some basic advice about two-stone handicap games that I read somewhere on Sensei's: two stones is not a big advantage, even though it may feel like it early in the fuseki.  There's no need to play recklessly to try to catch up too quickly.  Make as many stable fighting units as you can, play thick moves and try to get close enough that grabbing the biggest points in the endgame will be enough to put you ahead.

Now (10 minutes later), having looked over the game once, it seems my preemptive advice was quite apt.  You played too wildly.  Black made enough mistakes that if you just played steady moves you would have had an easy game.]
;W[pq]LB[qf:C][po:A][qo:B]TR[pd]C[*X*: Personally, I don't like to play komoku in handicap games, because the relationship of the marked stones is bad for White.  If Black gets to play A or B, he will have a good opening.  Still, because Black is likely to take the last corner instead of approaching immediately, you may get to forestall this by approaching at C yourself.]
;B[dc];W[de]LB[qf:A]C[*X*: I won't say it's necessary to approach at A immediately - D15 is certainly big too - but try to end in sente so you can come back and get A before Black can approach the lower right.]
;B[fd]
(;W[ch]C[C17 is usual, but ends in gote.  If this is an attempt to get sente, it may be okay, but I'd prefer immediate tenuki, in that case.]
;B[qo]C[*X*: Black has resisted your attempt to get sente and gotten the big approach on the right, so you should look for a way to continue in the top left.  H16 looks like a good squeeze.]

(;W[po]C[*X*: Although you want to achieve solidity for yourself, you don't want to solidify Black too much, either.  I'd prefer something other than contact.  How about a pincer?]
;B[pn];W[oo];B[on]C[*X*: Bad mistake for Black.];W[qp]C[*X*: Good shape for White.]
;B[qn];W[no];B[pi]C[Black seems better here.  Did I do something wrong in lower right?  Should I have played elsewhere sooner?

*X*: No, this is better for White.  You're thick and have a lot of territory.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]
(;W[cl]LB[jp:a]C[Would this move have been better around A?

*X*: Absolutely.  Around A (or K3) you get a moyo on the lower side that's as big and more solid than Black's right side.  Then Black has to extend to C10, so you settle yourself in the top left with C17 and end in sente to invade the top side.  See variation.

Also, once F3 and F4 are strong, you can think about exploiting Black's weakness at C3.  In the game, you tried diving in there without defending yourself first, so of course you ran into trouble.  Make a fist, then strike.]
;B[cm]C[*X*: This is a bad move by Black, since after you play D8, Black still has weaknesses in the corner.  See http://senseis.xmp.net/?ClumsyDoubleContact.]
;W[cd]TR[cm][eq]C[*X*: This move is by far your worst of the game.  It's wrong locally and globally.

First of all, you absolutely must play D8.  Then you'd get perfect shape with C12 and have weaknesses to aim at in Black's corner.

Secondly, if you weren't going to play D8, then K4 is the next biggest thing on the board.

Finally, this move is pointless in the local context.  It induces Black to make a large territory in the corner and gains you very little, since you'll be left with a weakness at C14.  The three triangle-marked moves were all very wrong.  See a pattern?  Unlearn this move and you'll be at least a stone stronger.]
;B[cc];W[nc]C[*X*: D8 and K4 are still the biggest moves on the board.  Considering only the top side, I prefer the wedge at L17.]

;B[pf];W[qe];B[og]LB[nd:b][od:a]C[Presumably this was an error by Black, who should have played at A ?or B

*X*: Yes, of course.];W[od];B[nd];W[oc]
(;B[mc]C[*X*: Ridiculous.  N16 would still lose a bit locally for Black, but at least he'd have a thick position and good prospects in the centre.]
;W[ne];B[nb];W[of];B[ob]C[*X*: Black was way too concerned with saving a few stones.]
;W[md];B[lc]C[*X*: Should be a won game for White now.  Go back and play K4 and Black's chances are slim.]
;W[cq]C[First, should I have played in lower left corner now?   If not, where?

The way I did it worked out badly.  Where did I go wrong?

*X*: I'd be tempted to call this the game-losing move.  Invading the corner is an endgame move and, worse, weakens both F3/F4 and C8.  Either D8 or K4 is better.  Once you're solid on both sides, *then* you can think about invading the corner.]
;B[er]
(;W[bo]LB[fr:a]C[Should this have been at A?

*X*: No.  Should have been at K3.  I still don't like C3, but at least if you go back and play K3, you can consider C3/E2 to be a probing exchange.  Locally, C5 probably better than B5.  B5 lets Black play C5 in good shape.  If then W B7, B D8, W C9, B B4, White has gained little.]

(;B[gr];W[fr];B[fs]C[Now, how best to constrain Black?];W[hq]
;B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jr]C[*X*: Big mistake.  You have no choice but to keep pushing.  However, even without taking weak groups into account, you can see that Black's intrusion on your lower side potential is far greater than what you've gained in the corner.  Add to that the fact that you end up with a weak group, which can usually be evaluated at minus 20 to minus 40 points, and you've lost the game.]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[jp];W[kr]LB[gq:a]C[Better at A?

*X*: No.  Having played K2, you're committed to fighting it out.  However, when Black cuts at A, you have to play H4 and let the three stones go.]
;B[gq]
(;W[gp]CR[hq][iq]TR[fp][fq][fr]C[*X*: This is really, really, really terrible.  Maybe worse than C16.  You have two sets of stones - the triangled ones and the circled ones. Which ones are important?  The triangle ones are doing nothing at all, while the circled ones are cutting stones.  It's no contest.  H4 is the only move, even though it's terrible shape.  Of course, you'd rather play J5, since that's usually the right shape for saving two stones in a position like this, but here it doesn't quite work.  See variations.]

*X*: D9 is okay...];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[gl];B[gk];W[em];B[dm]

(;W[en]C[*X*: It's too soon to start making eyes.  Fight a little first.  H9 is the only move.]
;B[eo];W[co]C[Move
order?];B[do]C[(I may have recorded move order here wrongly, but final result is correct.)]
;W[fo];B[hl];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn]C[*X*: Getting squeezed like this is too painful to endure.]
;B[hk];W[bm];B[cr];W[br];B[cp];W[bp];B[dq];W[rp]C[*X*: If you're going to start playing endgame moves, B3 is definitely bigger than S4.  It's not just one stone... it makes a difference of something like 8-10 points immediately and, if Black doesn't answer, later C2 would be worth another 8 points gote.  It also makes the Black group not quite alive, so later events in the centre might make life and death an issue.

However, I think doing something about the center is more urgent.  If Black gets to play O7, he'll make a lot of territory there.]
;B[ro];W[ng];B[dd];W[ce];B[ee];W[ef];B[ej];W[fj]C[*X*: Unreasonable.]
;B[nh];W[nm]C[*X*: Good.];B[om]C[Now, how best to reduce (or invade!) Black's moyos at top and on right?

*X*: Well, it isn't a moyo on the right, it's territory.  The top is likewise hard to reduce much, but I would try a shoulder hit at J16.  F11 is, of course, huge for both sides.]
;W[mh];B[le];W[fi]C[*X*: Good!];B[mg];W[nf];B[mi];W[lh]C[*X*: Good.  I don't think the three stones are worth the Black ponnuki in the middle, so this is correct.]
;B[nj]C[*X*: Obviously a mistake.];W[oh];B[ph]
(;W[ld]C[*X*: Too small.  J16 much better.];B[kd];W[lg]C[*X*: Silly move.  M13 and O11 are miai, so you needn't play here.]
;B[ff]C[*X*: Huge.  Biggest move on the board.  You should have played J16 or at least F15 before now.]
;W[eg];B[kk];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[jf];W[jg];B[ig];W[fg];B[gf]

(;W[aq]C[Losing move!

(;W[bk]C[*X*: Silly.  You could resist.  See variation.];B[bn]
;W[al];B[ao]
(;W[am]C[Wrong

*X*: Yeah, ko is your last hope.];B[cn]C[The rest is not so interesting, I think.  Black won by 6 points.

*X*: Agreed, so I'll end my comments here.  There were so many tactical blunders by both sides that it's hard to point to any one spot to say "this is the game-losing move."  However, I'd say your biggest mistakes were in the lower left corner - first omitting necessary moves to solidify yourself, and then invading the corner for a few points of territory at the expense of losing a chance for a 40 point moyo on the outside and ending up with a weak group.

My advice is to concentrate more on fundamentals.  You're addicted to fighting and tactics, but those are just tools to accomplish your strategy, not substitutes for having a strategy.  Play thick moves.  Understand that thickness doesn't mean the same as influence; thickness has more to do with being free of weaknesses.  A solid territorial group can be as thick as a wall, so long as it is alive and not sealed in.  Don't be biased in your reading.  Take account of your own weaknesses as much as your opponent's and play to remove your own defects before attacking those of the opponent.]
