C[hi
i think i left places maybe i should have followed up with more or took more time and see if i could kill...like a group in the top right..i do alot of life and death but i never seem to be able to apply it to the games.]
;B[pd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 4k in my national ranking list. I hope my comments will be useful.

dede: W played too aggresive in this game, leaving many bad aji. Unfortunately, B wasn't able to use these ajis to punish W.]
