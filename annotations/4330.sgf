C[Hi,

I usually don't like to send games like these to review.  But I got out played the entire game :(.  I don't know what I was thinking.  Any and all comments would be good.

Overall I think white has played several unreasonable moves.  Black didn't take advantage of these moves and punish white for profit.  Also, black made a few passes during the game, and that caused black the game.]
;B[pd];W[cd];B[pp];W[dq];B[ed];W[gc];B[fe]C[ISK: I Found out this is not a good move .. but I don't really know how to play against 3,4 :(.

No, the game move is part of joseki.];W[jc];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc]
;W[be];B[hd];W[hc];B[id]C[ISK: This seemed bad, as it just helped him I thought about playing H14.  But my group seemed like it was hanging by tight thread X_X.

This is a critical point for black.  If white plays here, he will have a good shape.  You are pushing write down to the third line.  He is not making much territory.  You are building power by forming a wall on the fourth line.]
;W[jd];B[if]LB[je:A][cf:B][df:C][dg:D]C[Too timid.  Keep up the pressure by playing A.  Your aim is to build up power and later come back to harass white's upper left group with B.  White's upper group is missing a move.  Normally he will play C or D to complete the joseki.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[ISK: I Played this in hopes i'll make him heavy .. but didn't expect P17 >_>.  I guess it's true I rely too much on books :(.

Your thought process is sound, and the game move is proper.  Just don't expect your opponent always follows your wish.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[rc]LB[rb:B][rd:A]C[This is not good as you lose sente.  If you don't defend and take sente, you allow white to cut later, as occurred in the game.

Normally you have two choices here.  Play A to take sente, or B to take corner profit.  In this case I prefer A.  Please see the two variations.]
;W[rb];B[mc]LB[pj:A]C[Black loses sente here.  Play A.];W[mb]
;B[md];W[qd]C[This is big for white, but it's too early.];B[qe]
;W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[pj];W[jf];B[ig]LB[jg:A]C[In a shape like this, always hane at A (proverb - hane with your eyes closed).  Black is thick, and welcomes a fight if white cuts.]
;W[ph]LB[ke:B][pe:A]TR[mc][md][nd][od][pd][qe][re]C[ISK: Troubles begin ...

Positional analysis: black's marked group appears to be strong, but it has a weak point at A.  I will peep at B first to cut off white's path.  You can't expect to capture the invading stone, but pressure it to build center thickness as compensation.]
;B[ni];W[pf];B[pe]LB[nf:A][rf:B]C[ISK: Was that needed?

Yes.  If black plays somewhere around A instead, white's move at B is problematic.]
;W[mf]
(;B[of]LB[qg:A]C[A is better.  Please see variation.];W[og]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[nh];B[qf]LB[lf:A]C[A is better.]
;W[lh];B[kg];W[lb];B[mj];W[kh];B[jg];W[kj];B[ml];W[pn]C[ISK: White plays every where .. and I couldn't stop him.

I agree.  White is too greedy.  The starategy is to confine him to the side and take thickness as compensation.]

;B[rj];W[nn];B[lp]LB[mn:A]TR[pf][ng][og][kh][lh][mh][nh][ph]
[kj]C[Block at A to seal white in.  If you do that, white's marked group will be in danger.  It's unlikely you can kill this group, but you can profit from attacking.]
;W[ii];B[gi]LB[cf:A]C[This attack is too blunt and premature, and the strategy is risky.  Play A and see how white reacts.]
;W[cg]C[Now white invites black to attack his center group.  If it lives, black will be far behind in territory.]
;B[gk]LB[hk:A]C[A applies more pressure.  Black doesn't have to worry about cuts.]
;W[ik];B[kl];W[im];B[ip];W[jp]LB[jq:A]C[ISK: How do I answer this?

A is fine.  It looks submissive, but white helps black to solidify the lower side territory.]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[ko];W[iq]
(;B[lq]LB[io:A][hp:B]C[Connect at A.  The atari at B is too good for white.  Please see variation.]
;W[hp];B[io];W[jq];B[ho];W[gp];B[gm];W[oi]C[ISK: Didn't read enough :(.  Because I should have played P10.

I made a comment in your variation.]

right, this is a pass.];W[hl];B[gl];W[jk];B[kn];W[jm]LB[sn:A]
C[ISK: Game over .. after this I lost hope :(.

Black's only hope is to play A.  White is not alive yet, and black may be able to kill.]
;B[ci];W[cn];B[bb]LB[cp:A]TR[gi][gk][gl][gm]C[Not that it will change the outcome of the game, black should play A to live in the corner.  A is the weak point of the "large knight" enclosure.  Since the marked stones are strong, in case white drives black to the center black can handle the fight.]
