C[Warder05 [15k\]: Good luck.
Georgi [14k\]: hi];B[qd]C[When I look over this game, I realize it should really be considered a victory for White. Until the invasion 3-3 invasion very late in the game, I was in control of the board or so I felt. I'm particularly interested into how to make better use of my thickness, but any insights would be appreciated.

Hi this is my first review for the GTL. Ill try to do my best if u have any questions after this review u can always email me.

;B[qj]TR[oc][qd]C[Maybe I should have approached white's corner stone, but I don't feel that this was a particularly bad choice.

This is a normal extensions from the corner stones. But i think a aproch to the C16 would be a little better beacous this seems a little passive. In my database the pro players made a aproch at E16.]

;B[pj];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[si];W[rl]C[Warder: While White has the Corner, I feel that my outside thickness more than makes up for it. Especially, since The O8 stones are really inefficient.

Yes its a VERY good trade for u.]N[Compensation];B[df];W[cf]
TR[df]SQ[gd][if]C[i would block off the intrusion of ur moyo first with J14 or a extra attack at G16 white attacking the D14 stone would be less big when u can secure ur moyo.]

;W[ce];B[dd];W[dc]TR[dd][de][df][dg]C[Warder05: Moves 55-62 probably weren't the best exchange. There was a bad taste left in my mouth after this sequence.

Yes securing ur moyo more or blocking the 3-3 would be better. White got the solid teritory there  and this wall dont got alot use.]

(;B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf]C[Warder05: Such a small reward! There had to have been a more severe attack than this. Maybe if I'd made it earlier.

Attack is not always the way of winning closing ur moyo off earlier would had been better.]

(;B[fq]LB[cn:a]TR[cp][cq]C[Warder: This was an attempt to stop the 3-3 invasion. Maybe if I'd taken more time to think, I would have been able to limit the damage. I also probably should have played 173 at 'a'.

The only move to stop the 3-3 is C4 or C3 but C4 is the best of the 2 F3 or C6 will turn it in a ko.]
