C[Thank you for the review.
There was no time limit on the game.
No take backs

I am just starting out. I have read a number of books and am trying to get better at this very frustrating game. I I felt good about my opening. It was later that everything fell apart for me.
I have Tried to comment where I think I did things wrong. I like to study my games so I can improve.
I am not looking for a lot of detail. Ilike to figure out issues myself. I would appriciate a few "you need to look at this move" pointers.
Thanks

Lonnie-

   There is good news and bad news.  The good news is that you played a nice game.  Much better than you realize.  The game was scored wrong and you won by over 35 points.  Nothing really fell apart for you.
     The bad news is that a review of a game you won is not that helpful since the moves you made were good (at least relative to your opponent's moves).  However, I will comment on both white and black to point out some of the weaknesses in the game.  My comments will be preceded by >> in the game record.
        If you have any questions about this game or future ones please feel free to send me a record and I would be glad to take a look at it. 

 Welcome to the game of go.

 Barry];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[eq];B[on]C[>>This is an unorthodox move by black and not a standard joseki.  I'm not saying it was a bad move, but something I'm not very comfortable with.  Typically beginner players utilize territory building moves more in the beginnning of the game.  A stronger player may have been better able to exploit the weaknesses in the move.


 Here are some general rules from a book called "Five Hundred and One Opening Problems" that might be of some help in deciding moves.

 When making a move in the opening stages there are three essential questions you should ask yourself in the following order:

 1.  Is there an urgent move?
        a. one that makes a base for your stones
               b. one that takes away the base of your opponent's stones
               c. one that takes the initiative in a certain area
        2.  Is there a big move?
               a. one that extends from you own position
               b. one that prevents an extension by your opponent
               c. one that threatens an invasion
               d. one that prevents an invasion
        3.  Is there a big moyo? ( a moyo is a framework that maps out a large potential territory)
               a. Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
               b. Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo.


               These are some good general rules to think about when deciding your next move during an opening.]

(;W[dq]C[>>Poor move by white. For example, he would have done better by sealing you off in the corner. [see var.\]]

;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[ce];B[eb]C[>>While this is a good move, black could have easliy done the same thing after extending to f16 first and then connect the cutting point.]
;W[qq]C[Was this played Ok if not brilliant?

               >> Actually if white wanted to close off the corner, r5 would have been better.  That moves captures the corner and threatens to play under black's stones]
;B[id];W[gf];B[gd]C[>>While not a bad move it was not the biggest move available.   It was not critical to protect that cut.  The corner is safe and you can easliy extend along the top from j16.  Perhaps an extension along the left side would have been better.]
;W[ei]CR[ci][cj]C[>>Weak move by white he would have been better served by solidifying a base at c10 or11.]

;W[pn];B[om];W[oo];B[lp]C[Good Move?

               >>It turned out good, but only because of the way white played against it.  What if white had tried to split that stone from the top right?  [see var.\]]

               >> I think white could have cut you off and driven the stone into the white wall, if he had not played so conservatively.  Don't play close to your opponent's strength.

               You might have tried to attack his group in the upper left by first splitting it off.  [see var\] or sealing off your moyo on the top.]

(;W[rd];B[rc];W[rf];B[sf]C[>> white is just trying desperation moves at this point.   This is generally regarded as impolite if you are merely relying on a misclick by your opponent to try to win, especially if you are playing against a stronger player.

               I don't have any more comments at this point and but will try to give you some helpful general pointers to help you improve.

               1.Practice life and death problems.  This will help you the most at the stage you currently are.  

               2.  Look for the biggest move on the board];W[qg]
