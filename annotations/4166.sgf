C[Dear reviewer,

I played this with White on KGS and lost by 10 points. Going over it, it is still far from clear what caused the loss except perpaps my poor way of treating Black's first invasion at C8 and my play at tengen in move 82.
I guess your view will be much clearer.

Thank you very much for reviewing this !
Hans Meyer



Hello,

Overall, this was a correct game, thought both players have been fairly smooth with one another.

There was never a situation when a group was at stake, and basically, you lost because of a difference in efficiency in eroding each territory.

What cost you the game were appreciation mistakes, the most severe being at move 26.

You must learn to look for weak points in your opponent shapes (a good reading is "how to make good shapes" by Bozulich).

Also, in the same reading appreciation, there was a weaker play by white in the sequence starting with black 43.

i'd say those two mistakes cost you the game, despite a good yose.

Hope this helped.

Regards

Emmanuel];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk]MA[ec][ed]C[This is not usual :

One of the main point about C16 is that it should call for a more urgent move than the chinese R9, because W would then take the corner with E17

Therefore, most of professionnal answers to C16 are played at E17 or E16

There is only one game in Gobase that has this fuseki : Chen Zude - Fujisawa Hideyuki in 1973. (White played then O17, just in order to make a fool of what I just said about the corner ...)]

(;W[jp]C[A preventive counter measure to Black playing here, as is the intention of the Chinese opening.


An other is to take the corner at E17
That would have been my choice (it is slower however), but K4 cannot be bad]
;B[fc];W[dj]MA[dc]C[Again : my style would get me the corner, forcing B to extend.
Then you can play D10

(;W[db]C[Now that he chance to kill is gone, taking the large corner instead


Ah, this is important.

The chance to kill is not gone.
In any case, B is weak, and you SHOULD NOT abandon a severe play against a weak group.

Remember the 4 rules :

- Am I weak ? -> play urgent defense

- if not : is he weak ? -> play immediate attacks aiming a putting opponent off balance (shape moves, eye stealing, ...)

- if not, where is it big for me ? -> play there

- if nothing really big, is there something big for him I can take ? -> play there.


In comparison, here you get 8 or so points , not even sente because you are not threatening life. This is a yose move.]

Those K10 stones have aji, because the triangled stones are weak.

However, you MUST be sure to end with sente, because this is not the largest part of the board, which is M16 / M17 ...

Because you have miai points with the K10 aji (L11, G9), it is much likely that black will not be able to transform the centre into territorry, even if you finish gote with an M17 invasion.]
