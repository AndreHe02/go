C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I will be reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name, so you'll recognize which comments are mine.

The biggest mistake both players made was completely overlooking what moves were needed to keep their stones connected; and the other side of this, which moves could cut their opponent.]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[pd];W[qp];B[ee];W[nc];B[pf];W[hc];B[kd]C[is l16 ok?

Ted: It's not a bad idea.  White played O17 and H17 too far apart.]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[ld]C[how to react? ^^* I was confused here...

Ted: That's a good question!  I must admit that I too have difficulty figuring out which side of a cross-cut to respond on.

I looked at a couple of lines starting with N16 and have included them.

(I should add that I once had a single-digit kyu review one of my games, and when I asked which side of a position I should have played on, he responded that he too had difficulty which side is better in many situations!  :-)]

;W[la];B[mb];W[nb];B[le];W[ma];B[ld];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[je]
C[Ted: I think this move is too small.  Better to let White play K15 if he wants, as long as you get a nice approach move like E3 or P3 first.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[ng];B[pi];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[qe];W[qb];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[dj]C[Ted: Good idea finally taking sente to play a bigger point!]
;W[fc];B[gd]C[Ted: You really didn't need to respond to White's last move, which is small.  Use sente again.  Anything along the bottom like E3/4, K3/4, or P3/4 is good.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[ic];B[hf]C[Ted: Unneccessary right now.  The stones at G and H 16 can connect to E15.]
;W[gh];B[dn]C[Ted: Good!];W[ep];B[qn]C[Ted: Another good move!]

(;B[kp]C[Ted: I don't like this move, largely because I think you should try killing White in the bottom left corner.  I think I'd play D3.]

C[Ted: I think here I would have played C16.  Keep everything connected, and you can reduce White if you get the chance to play E18.]
;W[cd]C[Ted: White turns from you trying to split him, to him trying to split you.]
;B[cc];W[be];B[ac];W[dd];B[ec];W[ed]C[Ted: Note that the Black group at the top is not connected to anything!  Further, White has a weak point at B18 to exploit.]
;B[fd]C[still possible to kill this group ?
and from the beginning?

Ted: I don't think it was possible to kill the group from the beginning; better to get more territory.  I think you eventually got lucky in that your group in the top left didn't get killed.]
