AB[pd][dp]C[I will appreciate the comments.
I will also appreciate if the reviewer can create some important/critical
variations into the review file.

I lost the game by 4.5 points. Aside from the comments, i have one question
: What could I have done In the end-game to win the game?

Thank you very much.

;B[mp];W[pj];B[jd];W[dj];B[fc]C[This move is good, it works well with your own stones and is a nice approach to w's corner.]
;W[df];B[cn]C[Again the right direction. B has maintained his lead from the two stones up to know.]
;W[cl];B[dh]LB[qg:A][ip:B][cc:C][db:D]C[But this is, maybe, questionable.

1st of all, around 'A' there is still a big move left on the board, also around 'B'. Both nice places to play now.

But 2nd, depending on the development of the game you can reduce w's territory on the left with 'C' or 'D' later. So there is no need to rush to play there. It is ok that your opponent gets something somewhere, as long as you develop your own positions as well.]

And that's what I meant with "sligthly too early" in my comment about the ponnuki in the var. Now you have to enter the corner, because w has get too much territory on the left side otherwise. But if you had played 'A' instead of the invasion somewhere in the near future, you would more like to invade at 'B', than at 'C', probably.]

C[I think your endgame is quite ok. In my oppinion your biggest goal you have to long for now is to overcome a strategical false habit: You don't grant your opponent any bit and you don't want him to hurt anything what is your sphere of influence. Examples of the first statement are the moves #18 and #32, for the second is #28. I do not want to say more than this, because it is *the* outstanding mistake in your game.

How to overcome it? It is a problem of the early stages of the game, the late fuseki and the early middle game. Try to concentrate on this part in your next games. Every time, when you have the feeling that you want to invade something or protect something of your own, ask yourself two questions. 1st: Are there some really big moves left on the board and if not 2nd: What is the trade-off I want to make with this invasion/reduction/securement. What will I gain, what will I lose. Is there a bigger tradeoff? E.g. #26, invading the corner. You gain a lot - the corner. But you have to pay for it - your upper side hurts a bit.

Well, that's the way it goes. Ask both: What will I gain, what will I lose. And if you are sure that you lose less than you gain, give it with pleasure. If you want to have everything, you will ending losing everything. Look again at the board, at this end position. How many stones have you so eagerly invested in the left side, trying to destroy everything w has there. What was the outcome? w captured them all...]
