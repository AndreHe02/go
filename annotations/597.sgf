C[This was a game played on Jun 27, 2001.  I played black and thought I had the better strategy throughout the game but my tactics were subpar as usual.  Any advice would be appreciated.

rev: Hi, I앐 Jorge Antonio Blanco Montagut, jorgeant 12k* in igs, but believed me, there is not much difference between us, so even i앐 to do my best, don앖 believe me too much ;-)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[pi];W[pf];B[oe]C[Here I planned to answer most any response with K16.

rev: mmm, i앐 more agresive so i never play your 3,5 so i am not sure what black should do, but honestly, i don앖 like 7, i would prefer r15, it look for less territory, but is more agresive and secure, now i bet white will spoil your aim with k16 and 6 can live to the right or escape]
;W[og]C[rev: all right, no more bets ;-)];B[jd];W[qd];B[qc]
;W[md];B[mc]C[rev: attacking too close is not good, always better indirect attacks like being strong around like with q16 or something like f17]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[rev: in general the defender extend with m17, here cutting at o16 is better, but p17, mmm]
;W[nd];B[nb]C[rev: always too close, it helps the attacker]
;W[lc]C[rev: ?];B[mb];W[mf]C[This seemed slow to me so I ignored it.

rev: yes, but something like q17 would make the entire white group unsettle]
;B[fc];W[dc]C[He really wanted that corner so I left it at that.

rev: 22 is bad and you should continue pressing with something like c14 aiming to extend right and bottom]
;B[cn];W[ck];B[cq]C[rev: the bottom is too open to play c3, better going before to f3]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[en]C[rev: too conservative, what a black moho is borning]
;B[fp]C[I had planned on playing K4 or K3 depending on thinking he would react to this play.

rev: if 35 is trying to close a door, you have left to much room in the bottom, i would play somewhere between 1 and 33]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[rev: you are not going to be able to keep the entire bottom, so i would like r8 and then lets see which is my slice, remember that most of the time to attack from the weak side is the right move]
;W[pk];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql]C[rev: why not white q8?];B[ni]
;W[qi]C[rev: being white stronger up and down your dragon, it really hurts, but i also think it압 too close]
;B[nk];W[ph]C[rev: white shoudn앖 leave the dragon escape so easily, p8 is THE move]
;B[pj]C[I have doubts about this move, it seems wasted as a fuseki.

rev: p8 is also your move but white has to answer at r10, so ...]
;W[qj];B[fn];W[em];B[fm];W[jq];B[lq];W[kq]C[rev: bad];B[kp]
C[rev: use to be better to extend when you are strong and to cross when you are weak]
;W[hq]C[rev: but of course good or bad depend also from the answer ;-)]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[ir]C[This seemed a silly move after I played it, but it helped at the end, any better alternative?

rev: don앖 play a killing move if you are not sure, better let white a little scarcely life making you big territory with m2]
;W[lp];B[mq]C[rev: don앖 be afraid, m2 continued being a good move]
;W[iq]C[rev: bad, h2 was THE move];B[hr];W[in];B[lo]C[rev: l6]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]C[rev: what a item life and death!, but here i would have player s3]
;B[qp];W[sr]C[rev: i can앖 imagine how white can be alive now, THE move was s4]
;B[so]C[rev: is not a good tactic let white live with s4 ;-)]
;W[rs];B[rq];W[sq];B[ro]C[rev: q1 was the kill move];W[ps]C[rev: s**t, that was so many point, but don앖 worry, you can앖 imagine how usual are this kind of burdens in much much stronger players, anyway, let go to a neccesary item, counting ...
white uper left 12
white low left 15
white right 15
white right corner 2
so white 44
black up 10
black low left 12
black low right 17
so black 39+sente
so the game is balanced, but what should you think about now? you have to keep alive 9,21 group, invading left white moho and trying to kill white low group to make point, let see]
;B[rl];W[rk];B[rm]C[rev: there are urgent moves, big moves, and "other" moves ;-)]
;W[sk];B[pl];W[rn];B[sn];W[qk];B[sm]C[rev: with 87 you have changed sente for 5 points, i would prefer sente, there is all around big moves]
;W[oj];B[oi]C[rev: mmm, you save 4 point, but that area has many defects, perhaps would be better to give up those two stones ...]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[rc];B[rb];W[rd];B[ci]C[rev: attack a strong group is not the best way because it don앖 have to be defended, i bet white should do something like c13]
;W[cg]C[rev: it hurts!];B[ei];W[ek];B[fg];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc]
C[rev: it looks overplay];B[hd]C[rev: good];W[hb];B[ld]C[rev: !!! i can understand f16 or j17, but 105 ...]
;W[od];B[kd];W[fd];B[id];W[fb]C[Should I have reinforce the top board now, I seem to think that M17 is dead so could make an eye?

rev: white is unneccesary, you never would let live 102 group, of course m18 is dead and 103 group is joint to 13 group, what to do now?]
;B[pd]C[rev: a good choice];W[me];B[pe];W[qe];B[il]C[I did this as a cap and use my thickness to the right and top.

rev: it압 also good but i only want to mark that the right white group has some interesting defects so would be interesting to fix the black border with o10 sometime]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[km];B[lm]C[rev: be thick, don앖 put stones inside if it is not a killeyes stone]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[hk];B[ik];W[gm]C[rev: it hurts me, a move i haven앖 view, am i the reviewer?]
;B[ho]C[rev: very good, better that i would do];W[io];B[ge]
C[rev: h6 and so on!, white 64 is not attached to 126];W[fe]
;B[ff];W[de]C[rev: very bad move, it압 not only unnecesary, it let you close your central moho, here you are going to make a lot of point in the center, but believe me that no stronger player would be so generous with you, make points in the center is very difficult, you should try to change your style (well, i don앖 know if you always try to do the same), but not be offended, i also used to try the same when i was even weaker than now ;-)]

(;B[lg]C[rev: of course h6 continue being THE move, in relation with 133, i suppose it responds to accept that 64 and 20 groups are alive, and in that sense ...
white top left 32 points
white left 14 points
white right 17
white right corner 2
black bottom left 14
black bottom right 17
black top 13
so black needs 21 point in the center, it압 posible with 133 but i can앖 wait more, see variations]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[hm];B[fl];W[fk];B[el];W[dl]C[The next five stones seem a misread on my part, but it seemed to grab whites attention later giving me 2 free moves.

rev: well, you don앖 loss anything ...];B[eo];W[do];B[dm];W[fo]
;B[gp];W[cm];B[bi]C[rev: locally good, but the board is so big ...]
;W[bg];B[bk];W[bl];B[bm];W[dn]C[rev: big mistake, he had to play c8]
;B[al];W[bn];B[cl];W[dk]C[I see reviewing it that the entire white group has only one eye at the moment.  I did not think of this in the game,

rev: well, in fact there is a second one in the bottom];B[mg]
;W[hi];B[ij];W[fi];B[gh];W[fh];B[eh];W[fj];B[eg];W[bl];B[hf]
C[rev: many time a very conservative move is the best move, but ...]
;W[am];B[bj];W[nf]C[rev: s**t, that was your move, anyway, the battle hasn앖 ended]

(;B[im]C[rev: see variation and about 171, what do you win?]
;W[ko];B[mp];W[jo];B[lp]C[rev: so little ...];W[kl]C[rev: here was your move and now it hurts!]
;B[kk]C[The next few sequences I let white build my walls for me.  I figured giving one more eye to a live group would be worth that.]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk]C[rev: n7];W[mm];B[nm];W[mn];B[nn];W[nj]
;B[mj];W[of];B[sc]C[rev: mmm, i think j18 is bigger, but let counting to see how it goes ...

white top left 31
white right 15
white low felt 5
white right corner 2
+ 5 captured
black top 17
black center 28
black low left 13
black low right 8
+ 2 captured
(see again my past countings to see how badly i count ...)
so white 58 black 66+sente so now don앖 put yourself in troubles and try to keep sente, it압 very important to play the moves that keep sente and now is easy to see which are them]

rev: he is very skillfull in that ;-)];B[ng];W[bh];B[ai];W[bs]

;C[Pass];C[Pass];AE[fc][gc][lc][hi][fs][bs]C[Pass
--> done <--
{Game 6: koforgo vs applinc : W 56.5 B 70.0}

Thanks again for any help you can offer.  I tried to play this game safely as I thought my stones had more advantageous position thus no big captures on my part.

rev: all right, but please, try to focus your play in an ordinary behaviour, that is to develop first the borders and don앖 bother with burdens, that압 just time, good luck!]
