;B[jd];W[dc];B[dj];W[jj]C[Here I tried To balance it out];B[hk]
C[My bigest problem is how to respond to someones threat];W[il]
LB[ik:A]C[Here i thought of getting the bottom

This move is reasonable, I think.  I think playing at A is also pretty common in this situation.]
;B[ij]LB[ji:B][ik:A]C[I was confused at what to do

I'm
not sure that this move requires a response, and I am pretty sure you don't
want to play at A.  B seems like a pretty good move.  You can see now that
things might have been simpler if you had played at A initially.]
;W[lj]LB[gc:G][ce:E][cf:F][ch:H][dh:I][jh:D][ji:C][ik:A][jk:B]
C[So i just kept building my area

This
is a mistake.  You should either strengthen your wall at A or B, extend to
C or D, or play elsewhere.  I think C is probably what I would do.]
;B[ki]C[Now
Black will try to seal your group into the corner.  He is also working toward
a large territory in the center of the board.];W[cd]LB[ce:A]
[cf:B][ji:C]C[i started deffending the top area

If
you're going to play in this area, you should play at A or B.  C might also
be good, putting a hole in Black's wall in the center and threatening his
stone on the right side.];B[bf]LB[gc:A]C[as far as i see he is trieng to make more teritory for himself

Yes, and he's doing a good job of it.  This move doesn't need to be answered right now.  You should probably play around A.]
;W[hd]C[so i try to do the same, but i think i went out to far, it's just that i was worried of loosing the midle

You
have the right idea.];B[fd]C[This is the problem with a three-space jump.
 Black can split it, and then things get complicated.];W[fb]
LB[fc:A][gc:B]TR[hd]C[since i feel a thread i deffend my top right area

This would be better at A.  This stone can be separated from the marked stone by a play at B.]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[gd]LB[kc:E][ed:A][de:C][ee:B][cg:G][ji:D][ck:F]
C[i thoung of conecting my stones to have a stronger deffence,

Your
stones are connected strongly enough already.  You might want to play at
A, but the goal would be to get into the center, not to connect your stones
more strongly.  I think B or C is better for getting into the center than
A.  I would also think about playing at D-G.];W[ed];B[he];W[ic]
C[im not sure why i made that move];B[hc];W[kc];B[id];W[kd]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[ia]LB[ka:B][kb:A]C[This
is a mistake.  You need to protect the cutting point at A.  Play at A or
B.  Black should have played at A on his next move.]
(;B[ha];W[ja]LB[kb:A]C[Again,
you need to protect the cutting point at A.  If Black plays there, you lose
three stones and the corner.];B[gb]C[I'm not sure why Black did this.  He might be trying to make an eye, but he doesn't need to.]
;W[ga]C[Obviously a mistake.  Your stone is in atari.];B[fa]
;W[eb]LB[ea:A]C[Good move.  Playing at A will cost you.];B[kb]
C[Black notices your cutting point.];W[ka];B[la];W[kh]LB[ke:A]
[kf:C][lf:B]C[This
leaves both sides too weak.  A or B would strengthen your stones at the top.
 Black can split your three-point jump by playing at C.];B[ji]
C[This move threatens both white groups.];W[li]LB[kj:A]C[A is better.]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[ke];W[le];B[lc];W[kg];B[ld];W[ea]LB[ee:B][ig:A]
C[This
is much too small a move for this stage of the game.  A or B would be good
to start reducing the center territory.];B[kj];W[jk];B[ii]LB[kk:A]
C[Black should probably be more aggressive here and push in at A.]
;W[kk];B[hl];W[ik]C[This move is worth 1 point.  You need to make bigger moves at this stage of the game.]
;B[gj];W[hm]C[This
is another endgame move.  You need to reduce the size of the center territory,
not grab 1 point here and there.];B[gm];W[im];B[de];W[ef]C[It's too late for this move now.]
;B[ee];W[fg]C[Black
has so many stones around to help out in this fight, there is no chance of
making life in the center.  Your only hope is to connect to the stones on
the right.];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[gg];B[ff];W[gf];B[df];W[hf]
;B[if];W[ig];B[jg]LB[jh:A]C[Black
has made a big mistake.  If you play at A, you can save most of your stones
in the middle, and Black loses about 20 pts.]
(;W[je]C[This move is pointless.];B[ih];W[jh]C[One move too late.]
;B[hg];W[hh]C[No point in playing here, these stones are dead.]
;B[ig];W[cg];B[cf];W[ce];B[dd];W[cb];B[ec];W[bg];B[gh]C[This
is a pointless move by Black.  These stones are already dead.  Cutting them
apart does no good.]

(;W[ed]LB[bc:A]C[This move allows Black to kill your group.  This move is worth less than one point.  You should play at A.]
;B[bc];W[cc];B[bb]LB[da:B][ec:A]C[Now
the White group cannot live.  The eye at A is false, and you can only form
one eye around B.];W[fe]C[This move won't do you any good unless Black falls asleep.]
;B[ge];W[ab]LB[cj:A][ck:B]C[The
white group is dead, so playing in this area doesn't do you any good.  You
should be making territory in the lower left.  Make use of that big strong
wall.  Maybe a play at A or B?];B[ba];W[ca];B[ac];W[ck]C[Good.]
;B[cj]LB[dk:A]C[You
should play at A.  A better sequence in shown in the variation starting here.]

is a mistake.  If Black plays at A now, you're in trouble.  Even worse, he
could start at B.  See variation.]

got off to a great start in this game because White was too cautious in the
opening.  Tactical mistakes also cost White quite a few points in the endgame.
 Work on protecting those cutting points.])
