C[>My rank still varies. it depends what kinda day i'm in. ^^
>This, I played when i was 28k
>I'm white.
>I lost this game by 3.5 points.
>I screwed it up making a weird shape, you'll see
>I'd like to know how my fuseki is.

sure, no problem.

fuseki wise, you have a little trouble with choosing the correct direction of play sometimes, but that's not a major difficulty at your level.  and it's not so hard to learn.  more importantly, you focused too much on playing very small moves in the bottom left over making big moves when the situation was not urgent.  also, your extensions were a little off, and you didn't ever approach the white 3.3 corner, which I thought was a big mistake.  that said, for 28k your fuseki is coming along fine.

overall, besides some obvious unnecessariness...I thought this was a good game for two 28kish players.  two things that both players should focus on:

1) Shape.  there were more empty triangles in this game than in a geometry book.  pick up a copy of "Making Good Shape" or something similar.
2) Stop making slow gote moves.  Every move you make, ask yourself "is this slow, and gote?"  =)  Ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with this move.  what good does it do?  if you are protecting a cutting point, look and see how many different ways you can protect it...and then choose the best one.  check to make sure the cut works!  Don't stop reading at the cut...check the followup and see if the cut actually does anything harmful, or see if you can maybe give up a stone or two for a superior position.

your ability to determine what moves are possible and which are impossible will improve with experience.  if you have any questions or comments, feel free to send them to me at vorpalita@yahoo.com

(;B[qi]C[this move is a little weird.  not wrong, but it would be better placed at any of the marked locations.  Playing low on the right side is not as interesting as the left side, since black already has a low stone on the right, and both sides are high on the left.  If black wants to play on a large scale on the right hand side, the star point at q10 would be better balance.]

(;W[qf]C[this is unforgivable. =)  Black's bad move at r11 now looks like a good move.  White's best response is to tenuki.  See variations.]

;W[cn]C[good.  the right move.];B[dl]C[also good, though I might choose a low pincer.]

(;W[cl]C[ahhhhh!  bad!  white absolutely must make a one point jump to the center here.  there is no other move.  with other board positions, immediately jumping into the corner is okay, but here it would be disasterous for white.]

(;W[cp]C[this is also terrible.  now black can settle the shape in sente.  ANYTIME you see the pattern of C8/D8 & C6/D6, play D7.  Do not create the same pattern again and be so easy on black.  punish him for his mistakes.]

(;W[eq]C[this is slow, and gote.  what are you afraid of?  is black going to kill those stones?  no.  how many points is this move worth territorially?  maybe 4 points at most.  just about any other move on the board is worth more...  I'd go with K16/K17, whatever your taste is, or Q4.]
;B[gp]C[black decides that sente and points are overrated.]

(;W[dg]C[hrmm...maybe the wrong direction, but not a bad move.  D13 is extending towards the C9 stones...which are already strong.  black can not attack them.  so why help them out?  why not extend to G16 instead?  if black comes in and trys to invade on that side, he is going to be in for a fair amount of pain.]

(;W[di]TR[ci]C[>was it a good idea to try and connect passing the right side of the black stone marked with a triangle here?

not a bad thought...you can't connect any other way.  except that you don't need to connect these stones.  don't waste moves connecting two groups of strong alive stones.  better to attack more strongly, maybe D9.  Remember, attaching strengthens both stones.  don't attach to weak stones.  attack from a distance.]

I don't think so.  If you want to put pressure on black here, play high.  also...come from the other direction.  your stones on the left are stronger than your stones on the right.  why help out the strong stones?  start thinking more in terms of the strength of your stones than just making territory, and you will be come strong.]
;B[nc]C[great move by black]
(;W[oc]C[ahhh!  don't do that!  the black stone at o17 is weak.  the 3 space knight's move from k16 is exteremely loose.  touching this stone makes it stronger.  and this move doesn't defend the corner.]

I think you're doing fine.  make sure to go through the variations I've included and try to understand why they work, or don't work.  shape shape shape.  study shape.  study it until looking at bad shape make you physically feel pain.  you want bad shape moves to actually hurt you to have to make.  then, you will be on your way to becoming strong.]
