RE[W+10.50]

C[Dear Reviewer,
O played White in this game and won by 10.5 points; However, I am not not satisfied with my game during the opening and middle game stages. I have the feeling that Black came out of the middle game with a slight advantage.
Please help me understand how to improve - any comments are welcome.
Thanks! Avi.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[nc]
(;W[fq]C[This is in the wrong direction.  Because black has a shimari in the upper right, the right side is bigger than the bottom.]
;B[cm];W[jp];B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[rq]LB[qk:A]C[Too small.  Black should play at A.]
;W[ql]C[I decided here to give the corner and establish presence on the right side; The alternative of Black closing off this side looked to me favourable for Black.

Good.  The right side is big.];B[qr]C[Is P3 better for Black?

Yes.];W[pr];B[qp];W[pq];B[qs];W[ps];B[sr];W[qi]C[This is a great result for white.  White's framework at the bottom has become territory, and white has a safe group in the right side.  Black only got about 6 points in the corner.  White is ahead now.]
;B[qg]C[I looked for the best way to connect the side group to the bottom; I am not sure I found the best approach.

There is no need to connect.  just jump out into the center and your group is safe.]

(;W[om]C[This move is a little dangerous because there is a cut later.]

(;B[pm];W[pl];B[on]
(;W[nm]C[Is O6 better for White?];B[nn]C[This sequence is bad for black.  Heis pushing from behind, and just making white stronger in the center.  If these moves let black invade the bottom, they would be ok, but they don't.]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[Bad shape.  Hane at the head of the 3 stones.];W[lm]
C[Good.];B[kp]
(;W[lq]C[Good.];B[jo];W[kq];B[ko];W[ip]C[Overall it does not look too bad for White, but not too good either...

I think white is ahead.  White has more secure territory, and is thicker in the center.]
;B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[dr]C[Seems to me Black could use the sente better than D2...

Correct.]
(;W[oe]C[This was initially a probe to see Black intentions - I felt the side group is strong enough at this point.

I don't like this move.  There are big moves at the top and left. You can invade the upper right.  This move could help black secure the upper right, and can give him a target to attack while taking territory on the top.  or he could play below this stone and negate the white thickness below.

This is where you went wrong, giving black secure territory in exchange for a weak group on the outside.]
;B[og]C[...this means White has to attack the top...]
(;W[oc]C[You could also try attaching to the stronger stone, intending to cut off the weaker stone.  Usually attaching to the stronger stone is better.]
;B[nd]
(;W[ne];B[od];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd]C[This leads to a cut, but it feels wrong, since you are filling your own liberties.]
;B[pc];W[pf];B[pg];W[qf];B[rf]
(;W[qc]C[I would just cut at S13, since it leaves aji in the corner.  Exchanging this move for P18 makes black much stronger here.]
;B[ob];W[re];B[rd];W[rg];B[se];W[rh]C[I was quite satisfied with the result - although Black gained the corner, because it was Black's in the first place.

The corner wasn't black's yet, so this is only a good result if you can get a strong attack on the 3 stones in the center. Your stones are weaker, so it's unlikely.

Can black capture you with a move at N14?  You are very short of liberties, and black is thick above.  Without the exchange of R17 for P18, you are much stronger here.

It seems black can also capture you with a move at N15, which would work even without the exchange of R17 for P18.]

(;B[pi]C[Seems to me Black should have played N13 right away, is not it?

N13 is the key point if you have more liberties, but I think black can just capture your stones by playing at N14 or N15.]

(;W[me]C[I like the diagonal move better, to attack the weak group.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[nh];B[ng];W[lc]C[Looks good for White]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[jg];W[kf];B[kg];W[ie];B[gc]C[I felt Black is creating a new weak group while his middle gorup is not settled yet; I did not find the best way to take advantage of it.

Black's center group is close to settled, so it's hard to attack now.  Black's invasion is good. If this stone lives easily, white gave black a large corner for nothing.]

(;W[ec];B[jc];W[kd]C[Since you have to defend here, it seemd that you should have attacked from the other side.  Your stones on the right are too weak.]
;B[jd];W[je];B[lb];W[mb];B[kb];W[mc]C[Again it would be nice if you had not exchanged R17 for P18 earlier.]
;B[nb];W[ma]C[Is M19 better?

Unclear.  It gives black a forcing move.  If the same sequence is followed as the game, M19 would be better.]
;B[md];W[kc]C[This fills your own liberty.  I would play at M16, and fill an opponent liberty.]
;B[qb]
(;W[hd]C[Your move at L17 set up a peep at J18.  You should think about using it now.

This move reduces the usefulness of that peep.];B[hc]
(;W[fb]TR[hd][jg]C[Is this correct, or should I have played F17 and let Black live small on the top?

It is inconsistent with the marked move.  When black comes out, your  group to the right becomes weak.  I would take the outside.]

;B[eg];W[df];B[ib];W[hf];B[cj]C[Big.];W[ch]TR[eg]C[I think you should capture the marked cutting stone.  Your group in the upper right is weak.]

(;B[bi]C[Black misses a chance here to attack the big white group.]
;W[ii];B[mj];W[id];B[ic];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[ha];W[jb];B[kb]
C[Black lives anyway... At this point I thought Black slightly leads. The only way to take back the lead was to attck the Black group in the middle and gain some territory.]

(;B[ji]TR[li]C[Wrong side.  Black can capture the marked stone.]

(;B[rk]C[This was a nice gift from Black's side...

There is some danger from a move at M8 ...

Otherwise, this is a big success for white.  Black should have had some points in the center, but now has just a string of stones, and whites weak group is now safe.]

(;B[jl]C[Can black play N8 instead?  Since black is behind now, it seems he has to try.]

;W[ek];B[dl];W[bd]C[This is where I felt I am leading slightly.
The rest of the game is yose, and I think I managed to use sente to extend my lead a bit.
Any acomments on this stage are welcome as well!

Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

You are ahead already, and the endgame doesn't change the score much.  No more comments.]
