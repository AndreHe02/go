;B[qh];W[nd]C[ndkrempel: I wasn't sure of the best response here, I played Q14 quite quickly as a natural looking move...

PC: Looks good to me.];B[pf];W[pc]
(;B[qe]LB[pg:A][qc:C][qg:B]C[PC: The joseki has White exchanging 'a' for 'b' here before playing this move. Because White has omitted the exchange, it may be possible to resist by playing 'c' - see the variation.]
;W[qc]
(;B[rf]SQ[qj]LB[pg:A]C[ndkrempel: Fair result?

PC: Just considering the top right this is good for White: it's similar to the result of the joseki except that White has sente here. You have some compensation in that the marked White stone is cut off, but overall I prefer White.]
;W[jq];B[ck]LB[lc:A][oc:B]C[ndkrempel: Maybe kakari at C6 better?

PC: Yes. The problem with your move is that White will obviously push you towards the two strong stones at the top. First, though, I'd play 'a' (threatening 'b') to strengthen the Black stones and prevent White 'a' (which would undermine the Black stones) in sente.]
;W[cn];B[ch];W[ef]LB[db:A]C[PC: I'd expect 'a' here, taking territory in the corner and threatening the Black stones on the top edge.]
;B[lc];W[hc]
(;B[ic]LB[hd:A]C[ndkrempel: Sacrificing F17 to invade at 3-3.

PC: This is the first move by either side that I really don't like, as it leaves you split into two groups - neither very strong. Yes, you can invade the corner, but that will build White's influence, and that influence will affect both your group on the top and the one on the left. The simple move at 'a' looks better. White can live, but he'll damange both of his corners in the process (see the variation for some possibilities).]
;W[hd];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bd]LB[bg:A]
C[PC: There's no need for this sacrifice, which just helps Black make shape. White should just play 'a'.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[bc];W[bf];B[ad];W[mc];B[fb]LB[ea:A]C[ndkrempel: My overplay?

PC: Probably OK as it makes 'a' your sente.]
(;W[fa]LB[ea:B][fd:A][gb:C]C[PC: White could also consider 'a', answering Black 'b' with 'c' to keep his own stones connected and your top edge group weak.]

(;B[ga]SQ[fb][fc]LB[gb:B][hb:A]C[ndkrempel: Should be at H18?

PC: I don't think H18 ('a') helps much; White can answer at 'b' and, while your group at the top will be OK, White will gain strength by capturing the two marked stones and can look forward to attacking your group on the left. (see variation)]
;W[gb]LB[de:A]C[PC: It feels like White is trying too hard here, as your capture of F19 is sente because of the threat of 'a'.Just connecting seems good enough.]
;B[ea];W[fd];B[ha]C[ndkrempel: Should be at H18 and take gote?

PC: H18 would keep everything connected.];W[ib]C[ndkrempel: Aji here is bad for me. Should just K18 now.]
;B[hb];W[jc];B[id];W[kc]
(;B[lb]LB[gd:B][he:A][jb:C]C[ndkrempel: My overplay I think...

PC: Yes, but I think you need to try something here. If you play sensibly with, say, Black 'a' White 'b' Black 'c' (see variation), I don't think you have enough territory.]
;W[kd];B[he];W[gd];B[ld];W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[md];W[nc];B[mf]
;W[if]C[ndkrempel: I didn't see this move, it's amazingly effective.]
;B[ie];W[hf];B[jb];W[ge];B[ia];W[je];B[ib];W[jg]C[PC: White has a lot of thickness here, menacing your left side group, but the top right White stones aren't looking strong so you still have chances.]
;B[rd];W[ne]
(;B[rb];W[me];B[le];W[lf]
(;B[nf]C[ndkrempel: O14 should be at L18, wasn't reading.

PC: Yes. L18 still leaves White with some problems in looking after his group - see the variation.]
;W[kb];B[ka];W[mb];B[gc];W[la]
(;B[dq]SQ[ch][ck]LB[cq:B][er:A][hq:C]C[ndkrempel: What's best move here instead of D3? I think I should go back and look after my C9/C12 stones.

PC: Defending C9/C12 looks too slow. See the variation ,at the end of which the points on the board are roughly equal but White has sente and can profit by harrassing the C9/C12 stones, which are still not entirely safe.

If you want to play in the bottom left, 'a' is one idea, followed by 'b' if White doesn't defend the corner, or 'c' if he does.]
;W[eq];B[cp]C[ndkrempel: I don't know the standard way to live here?

PC:This looks like as good an attempt as any.];W[do];B[cr]
(;W[bp]LB[ep:B][er:A]C[PC: White 'a' might be better, working with the K3 stone. Note that Black can't cut at 'b' because the ladder works for White.]
;B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[gq]LB[bq:A]C[ndkrempel: I think G3 is an overplay, I can H2 instead perhaps, but there's no point. I should just play B3 or go back to C9/C12?

PC: I'd play B3 ('a'); if White plays there then you don't have two eyes. You're right that H2 is too small to play now.]
;W[hr];B[gp];W[fo];B[bq];W[bo]LB[co:A][cq:B][nq:C]C[PC: Gote, better to exchange White 'a' for Black 'b', then maybe continue with Whtie 'c'.]
;B[ho]LB[ek:A][lq:B]C[ndkrempel: Here I think I should play E9, and abandon those 2 stones for now?

PC: Pulling these stones out is a definite overplay, particularly as you're running towards your weak group on the left. You could play E9 ('a') now or, if you want to make use of your G3/G4 stones, play 'b' so that pulling them out will actually attack the White group on the bottom edge.]
;W[jo];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn];W[fl]
(;B[mq]C[ndkrempel: Definite overplay! K7 instead?

PC: K7 is the obvious move. See the variation for a continuation that might give you a chance, provided that your left edge group survives.]
;W[jm];B[hk];W[gl];B[hl];W[jk]C[ndkrempel: Can't see a way out of this now?]

(;B[ci]C[ndkrempel: C11 should be at D11? Still seems tough.

PC: K4 doesn't appear to work - see variation.];W[iq]C[ndkrempel: Only 1 eye, I resign.]
