AB[pd][dp]C[Hi... thanks for reviewing my game.  I've commented on moves that I feel unsure about, and would appreciate the most comments at those points.

Thanks again for your time...
-Eric];W[dd];B[pp];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og];B[me]C[I wonder if I should have played R15 first here.
:: yeah R15 is necessary];W[qc];B[qe]C[I feel as if Q17 might have been a better move instead of this.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[pc];B[fc]C[comment:: before this move ,, P17 first]

(;B[fd]TR[gb][hb][ib]C[comment:: this move is now least efficiency
F17,F16 is too near H17 (just 1 point!)
(* too narrow) you needn't play on Joseki now

and there is no area on (black triangle) too

back and see variation];W[cg];B[pj]SQ[cg]LB[eg:a]C[Looking back, I wonder if I should have followed whites marked stone with a play around 'a' instead of playing where I did.

comment: this move is right (attack white weak group)];W[jp]
LB[jo:a][jq:b]C[After white's move I was rather unsure of what to do next.  I considered either capping the white stone with 'a' or sliding under it with 'b', but since I was playing against a stronger player, I'd better err on the side of caution.]

(;B[gq]C[So, deciding that my stone on the left was weaker, I made an extention.

comment :: nope , wrong direction!
    see Q10? see variation ^-^];W[nh]
(;B[lh]C[Here I was trying to give my group in the upper right some breathing room, while at the same time enclosing the stones on the right.

comment:: don't worry ,,  because white has weak group too , so he can't attack you group  and you group is a bit strong  see variation]
