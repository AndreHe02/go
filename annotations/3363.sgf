C[Thanks in advance for taking the time to review my game =D
I am playing White.

-----

Alex:  Thanks for taking so much care with your own comments.  If you keep reviewing your games this way, you will surely improve!  I hope that I can manage to say something helpful too...

I made this review using the software "Jago" (http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/).  If you're using different software, it might display variations one move earlier than where I refer to them.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pc];B[oq]LB[pe:a][kq:b]C[This is a fuseki I see a lot (although usually I play R16 instead of Q17).  For some reason, when Black opens this way, I feel unsure of how to procede.  I guess part of me feels threatened that Black's going to take the entire bottom, I usually play F3, but somehow that felt uncomfortable this match.  What would you recommend?

-----

Alex: Actually, I feel that black P3 is a mistake, because it leaves black's shimari (P3-R4 enclosure) facing the 'wrong' way.  See the variation to the next move for an explanation of this.  Normally black would instead play somewhere in the area of 'a' (Q15) or 'b' (L3).

I would recommend white 'a', or perhaps R15.

Yes, black can threaten to take the entire bottom.  White can threaten to take the entire top.  And white has komi too.  There's nothing to be afraid of here!]

(;W[fq]LB[cn:a]C[Alex: if you want to play in this corner, it's better to approach from the more open side, i.e, play 'a' (C6) instead of F3.  That gives you more opportunity to use your D16 stone: instead of trying to destroy your opponent's territory right away, try building a framework of your own.  See the second variation.]
;B[dn];W[iq];B[pe]
(;W[mc]C[Alex: I don't like this move, because (a) it looks very passive, and (b) the connection between your two stones is thin: there's potential for black to cause trouble later.  Better would be O17.  Even better is R15: see variation.]
;B[ph]C[Here's that fear of losing an entire side again... I know the two-space extension on the 4th line is usually stupid, but I was looking for a way to keep the bottom right and upper right black groups seperate.

-----

Alex: Again there is nothing for you to be afraid of.  I think black made a mistake here, and should have played R17 instead.  If you just leave this position alone, you should find later in the game that there is plenty of room to invade under the 4th line stones if you need to.  Right now, the most important thing is to develop your D16 stone, e.g, with a move at C10.]

(;W[pm]C[Alex: by putting down a target for attack, you make it easier for black to develop the side.  It's too early in the game to be playing this sort of invasion.  Compare the variation.]
;B[pk]LB[qh:a]C[ANOTHER two-space extension on the 4th line?!  This formation is what got me the most frustrated.  I know that can't possibly be secure, but no one's ever tried that against me before, I have no idea how to take advantage of it.  Later on I try and fail to do something about it, but for now I just focused on the safety of my Q7 stone.

-----

Alex: It's important to remember that a string of stones on the 4th line does not take any territory.  If you play at 'a' (R12), it's nearly impossible for black to capture.

It is in attacking that the black stones will show their strength, so you want to avoid complicated fights in this area of the board.

Handling the Q7 stone is now a problem for you.  The more stones you play in this area of the board, the less you can afford to sacrifice, and so black can attack more effectively.]
;W[nm]LB[cj:a][oo:b]C[Alex: instead I would try either 'a' (C10), or 'b' (P5) aiming to invade the corner later.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[bd]C[I think I have a problem with underestimating the importance of the corners.  My first thought after black played this move was to play C17, but then I thought about Black playing C11 and decided against it.

-----

Alex: your first thought was quite right.  See the variation to the next move.]

(;W[ch]C[Alex: this leads to some rather complicated joseki, but I think it doesn't work so well with the stong black stones at D4 and D6.  See the variation to the next move.]

(;B[ck]C[Alex: a mistake by black.  C17 is still the most important point.]

(;W[df]C[Alex: C17!  See variation.];B[cc];W[dc]C[Alex: good move.]
;B[ce];W[dg]C[Alex: well, after mistakes by both players, white ends up with a good result, beginning to build a moyo at the top.  Well done.]
;B[cb];W[lq]LB[me:a][dr:b][np:c]C[Alex: I'm pleased that you resisted the temptation to play D18.  However, M3 is very small: it only expands your territory by approx 5 points, makes black only approx 5 points smaller, and doesn't really help your weak stones at O7 and Q7.

I think the important points in this position are 'a' (N15), 'b' (D2) and 'c' (O4).  It's hard to decide which is best, but my choice would be 'a'.]
;B[jd]C[Alex: this is a good move by black.  Now it's important that you attack this stone.  See variation to the next move.]

(;W[ic];B[id];W[hd]C[Alex: after seeing what happened next, I'm sure you realise that H17 instead of H16 is a better shape.]
;B[he]C[At this point, staring that those three Black 4th line stones was severly pissing me off.  So here's where I try to do something against it.  For some reason I thought that the cutting point at H17 wasn't a big deal, no idea what I was thinking.  But in the end it worked out I guess because I didn't lose that much and I got sente out of it.

-----

Alex: um, no, it looks to me like things worked out very badly for you.  You should play H17 here.]
;W[pf];B[hc]
(;W[gd]C[Alex: see variation.];B[jc];W[gc]C[Alex: it's better to leave this move unplayed and go back to the R14 area instead.  The reason is that you want to keep your options open: you might decide later than instead of G17, you would rather have played H18 to spoil black's eye shape, or M18 threatening to rescue the J17 stone.

This type of move (G17) is called "aji-keshi".  Aji is the 'potential' in a position: the stone on J17 means that you have a number of possibilites to choose from.  Aji-keshi is a move that deprives you of some of those choices--usually a bad thing.]
;B[hb];W[gb];B[ib];W[oe]C[After the game I played out a few variations and determined that this was a mistake.  I tried playing out P14 instead of this, but it wasn't much better.  A few trees ended in seki, but I couldn't find a way to kill.

-----

Alex: this is a complicated position, and it's hard to tell what the best move is.  I think I would try either R14 or Q13.  Playing a hane (P15 or R15) leaves cutting points in your shape, making it easier for black to fight.]
;B[pd];W[od];B[qf];W[qg]C[Alex: good move.];B[qc]
(;W[qe]C[Alex: perhaps Q18 is better.  See variation.];B[qd]
;W[rf];B[oc]C[Ouch.  I had completely and totally missed that cutting point.  At first I thought I could make it work, but then I realized it wasn't happening.  I ended up playing it out far too long too.

-----

Alex: this is the point at which you regret playing N17 back on move 10.  Imagine how much happier you'd be now with that stone at O17 instead.]
;W[pb];B[ob]C[Alex: at this point you should realise that the Q18 stones are captured, and look for the best way to give them up.  See variation to next move.]

(;W[qb];B[rb];W[rc];B[rd];W[ra];B[sc];W[oa];B[na];W[nb];B[pa]
;W[nc];B[qa];W[qi]C[Alex: This is a good idea, but I feel a bit nervous about the cutting point at P14, so I think I would play at P13 instead.  See variation to next move.]

(;B[qh];W[rh];B[og]C[Alex: a bad mistake by black.  This is another example of "aji-keshi" (see move 36): black loses the chance to cut at P14.]
;W[of];B[ng];W[lf]C[Alex: good move--but I think that N14 would be even better.]
;B[mf]
(;W[me]C[Alex: better to play M15, so that there are no cutting points in your shape.  See variation.]
;B[lg];W[nf]LB[mh:a]C[Alex: this is aji-keshi--it deprives you of the chance to play 'a' (N12) later.  It would be better to omit O14 and play L14 now.]
;B[mg];W[kf];B[ol];W[om];B[mk];W[kb]C[Here I had some grand delutions of killing the J18 group and winning back the points I lost in the upper right.  In retrospect, I must have been insane.

-----

Alex: actually, this looks like a good idea.  Black has two weak groups, and your stone at L14 is ideally placed to attack both.  The problem is that you made a mistake with your next move...]
;B[kc]
(;W[lc]C[Alex: this allows black to defend in sente.  See variation.]
;B[lb];W[la];B[jb];W[mb];B[jf]C[I knew it was over as soon as he played this move.  But I was hoping to get some kind of positional advantage of continuing the attack.

-----

Alex: black's J17 group will be very hard to kill now.  Your best chance is to attack the stones below.]
;W[jg]C[Alex: again you leave a cutting point.  Better to play at L13.]
;B[if];W[hf]C[Alex: L13 is still the right move.];B[kg]C[Alex: the position now looks hopeless for white.  There is very little territory, and no weak black groups that can be attacked.]
;W[ig];B[le]C[He completely caught me off guard with this move.  It's quite beautiful.

-----

Alex: there's nothing you could do to prevent this.  If you defend here instead of playing J13, then your stones on the outside (K13, H14) are too weak.

Yes, it is beautiful!];W[ld];B[ke];W[ge]C[As soon as I played this move, I realized that H13 was a way bigger cutting point than I had thought.

-----

Alex: yes, you should play G14 instead.];B[mo];W[rl]LB[lm:a]
C[kinda had to make sure that group lived.

-----

Alex: true, but by running down the edge of the board, your position becomes passive--and S8 doesn't actually make your stones alive!  I would play 'a' (M7) instead, and hope that some time in the future I could play O4.]
;B[hg];W[ie]C[Alex: the H15 stone is not important.  You get better shape by playing G14 instead.]
;B[ih]
(;W[jh]C[Alex: see variation for a more adventurous way to play.]
;B[ji];W[hh];B[kh];W[gg];B[ig];W[hi];B[rk]C[I thought I'd read that out, but I guess not.

-----

Alex: this is a good move by black.  Now it's hard for white to stay connected.]

(;W[qk]C[Alex: I think your best chance here is S10, although it gets rather complicated.  See variations.]
;B[qj]
(;W[pl]C[Alex: I think R8 is better.  See variations.];B[pj]
C[Alex: a mistake by black--I see no reason not to capture at R8.]
;W[ql]C[Alex: and now of course black should play S11!];B[lm]
C[HUGE mistake on Black's part.  At this poing I was already playing out in my head how I was going to get my group some eyes of its own, and had give up hope of connecting.  Thankfully Black missed this.]
;W[rj];B[pi];W[ri];B[fo]C[Alex: this is a mistake.  Black should play D2 instead.]
;W[cq]C[In retrospect, this was impossibly stupid.  It completely destroyed my territory on the bottom.

-----

Alex: no, I think this is one of your best moves in this game!  You can't make more than 10 points at the bottom anyway, and this way you do more damage to black--on the condition that you find the right follow-up moves...]
;B[dq]
(;W[cp]C[Alex: here you must play D2 first.  See variation.]
;B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[br]C[Something tells me I either made a mistake in the joseki or I didn't defend against this right.  I end up living, but just barely.

-----

Alex: both.  There is a better way to defend: see variation to next move.]

(;W[ao]
(;B[ar]C[Alex: this is a mistake.  Black can make a ko by playing A3.]
;W[bs];B[aq];W[ds];B[as];W[bq];B[cs];W[ap];B[es];W[bs];B[gq]
;W[gr];B[fp]C[I was expecting F2 instead of F4.  Maybe he was taking pity on me =(]
;W[fr];B[io];W[ko]C[Alex: M5 is better.];B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[gp]
;B[go];W[hp];B[ho]C[Alex: H5 removes an important liberty--black is now threatening to play H2.]
;W[hk]C[at this point I realize that territory reduction is pretty much my only hope, so I start pushing in.

-----

Alex:Yes, but making your stones at the bottom live is even more important!]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[gh];B[ei]C[Alex: This is a mistake by black.  You did a good job of punishing the mistake!]
;W[dj];B[di];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[cg];W[bh];B[dh];W[gk];B[ej]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[cl];B[dl];W[bk];B[el]C[Alex: this is a good point to estimate the score. Try to count how much territory each player has in each area of the board.  For example, at the top right, black has 7 points of territory, one prisoner, plus 5 points where stones were captured earlier in the game, for a total of 13.  Work out the total for each group on the board, then compare with my answers at the next move.  Of course the answers will be a bit approximate--some guesswork is needed!]
;W[jk]LB[nr:a]C[Alex: my guesses are:

Black:
  top right--13 points
  bottom right--approx 12
  top left--approx 8
  centre (near E5, O10, L14)--approx 25-30

total: approx 60

White:
  top and right side--15
  top (near E17)--approx 8
  left side--6
  bottom left--10 (remember the prisoners!)
  bottom--10, assuming these stones live
  komi--6.5

total: approx 55

so after your good work with the invasion on the left, you've nearly caught up: white is a little behind here, but it's not hopeless.

--

I think K9 is a mistake here.  I would prefer 'a' (O2), because is does two things: enlarges white's territory and stops black's expanding.  K9 achieves only one of those two goals.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[km];W[kj];B[lk];W[jj];B[jl];W[li];B[il];W[gm]
;B[hm];W[hl];B[gn];W[np]C[Alex: because your position is thin (gaps at N3/N4 and L3, and a weak point at H2), this way of playing is very risky.  O2 is still the right move in this area.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jr];W[lr];B[hr]
(;W[ir]C[And here's where I completely implode.  I totally missed the killing move of F1.

-----

Alex: yes, you must play H1 instead.  See variation.];B[lp]
C[Luckily, so did Black.  For now at least.];W[mp];B[nr];W[qo]
C[Alex: this move makes it easy for black to take territory in the corner.  S5 or S4 would be better (S4 can lead to complicated positions).]
;B[po]
(;W[pn]C[Alex: again, either S5 or S4 is better.  See variation.]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[pp];W[rn];B[rp]C[Alex: Let's repeat the counting exercise we did at move 177, and compare the answers.]
;W[ni]C[Alex: this is how I see things.

White:
  right side--18 points
  top (near E17)--approx 8
  left side--approx 6
  bottom left--10
  bottom--10
  komi--6.5

total: approx 60

Black:
  bottom right--15 points
  top right--13
  top left--approx 8
  centre--approx 35

total: approx 70
