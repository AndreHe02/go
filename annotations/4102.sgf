;B[pe]C[[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.];W[pp];B[ed]
;W[co];B[dq];W[hp]CR[fp]LB[do:A][cp:B]C[I couldn't find out, how to play after this move. How many possible joseki continuations are there?
A real game continuation
B would have been better, I think.

[EV\] The W pincer is wide and does not put much pressure on your stone, so I am not sure there are joseki continuations, or rather there are lots of choices, depending on your strategy.  The circled point (F4) would be my first thought, splitting W and preparing to jump into the center or take the corner later with B.  Your move at A is fine.  I initially did not like the move at B, but the variation diagram looks all right.  Tenuki also seems possible, particularly for a B extension along the left side, as W cannot kill with a single additional move.]

(;B[do]
(;W[dn];B[eo];W[cp];B[cq];W[en];B[fn]C[[EV\] This hane is normal when W does not have a stone around H4.  With H4 in place the cut is more dangerous.  I have no idea how this fight should turn out.]
;W[fo];B[fq];W[fp];B[eq];W[hn];B[fm];W[cl]C[Now, Black is not so happy with his stones in the middle, they are hunted by the opponent, who gains points on both sides.

[EV\] I think this is still even.  B has invested one less stone in this area than W, so a more fair evaluation would be after the next B move.  W has not yet made territory on the right.]
;B[fk];W[dj];B[fi];W[cd]C[[EV\] I think this is a mistake in direction.  The right and top sides are bigger than this area.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[be];B[ic];W[dg];B[ff]C[[EV\] This exchange was bad for W.  Both sides gained 10-15 points territory, but W is enclosed while B gained outside influence.]
;W[pj]C[A moyo versus moyo fight begins.];B[pc];W[hl]CR[eh]
LB[jd:D][qg:C][qn:A][nq:B]C[White attacks the stones in the left middle to enlargen his moyo.

[EV\] The W framework looks too wide open to be called a moyo, and no B stones are under attack.  Note that B can play the circled point on the left (E12) in sente any time to ensure a solid connection.  W cannot turn this area into territory with one or even two more moves.  I prefer any of the marked points for W.]
;B[qn]C[I guess I spotted the opponent's weak spot for my invasion.

[EV\] Good timing and good invasion point.]
(;W[ql]LB[pn:A]C[Slow move? Better on A?

[EV\] The attachment at A looks worse.];B[nq]C[A recently learned Korean invention.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pq];W[qq]C[White decided for outside influence.]
;B[po];W[on];B[qp];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[qo];W[np];B[nn];W[om]
;B[oq];W[mq];B[mr];W[lp];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[lr];B[nr];W[jd]
LB[ii:A]C[Now the White moyo is greatly strenghened and White presses deep into my moyo.

[EV\] The W moyo is now larger than the B moyo, so it seems strange for W to want to reduce B -- it should be the other way around.  I like a W play around A (J11), expanding his moyo and taking aim at the weak B connection around F13.]
;B[jc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[le];B[ij]C[I tried a counterattack to capture his reducing stones.

[EV\] Good direction.];W[hh]C[Again, White tried to use my weakness.]
;B[gi];W[fg];B[gg];W[gf]
(;B[hg];W[hf];B[ig]
(;W[lh]LB[fe:A]C[But he failed.

[EV\] What happens if W attacks with A (F15) instead of running?  The continuations look good for W.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[ie]C[[EV\] Nice move.  Good result for B, because W lost a tempo with M12.]
;W[jk];B[qh]LB[ki:A]C[[EV\] If B calculated that this gives a win, then it is fine.  But B still has a nice move at A to harass the W stones above while reducing the moyo below.]
;W[gq];B[kg]C[[EV\] How does this move help B?  Unless it is a preparation for L10 or L11, it needlessly strengthens W.]
;W[lg];B[oh];W[ni];B[mf];W[lf];B[mc]C[Now, I got back some territory.]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[md]C[[EV\] Bad shape and aji-keshi.];B[nc];W[rj]
C[[EV\] Think how much more threatening this move would be without the N16-O17 exchange.  W could contemplate corner invasions like R17.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[cm]LB[dl:A][bp:C][bq:B]C[A trick play,

[EV\] Which loses many points.  A play at A instead would make a nice reduction in sente.  B and C are also very large.]
;W[dl];B[cn];W[dm];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[bq];B[br];W[ao]C[But White wasn't tricked.]

;B[nh];W[mi];B[kj];W[lj];B[fr]C[[EV\] Very big.  W could hane and connect here in sente.]
;W[gr];B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[ls];B[bb];W[fl]C[I had overlooked the cut, so White took back the lead in territory. Once again the joseki in the lower left was unsatisfying for me.

[EV\] What cut?  And note that part of the problem is the failed trick play, not the joseki.]
;B[gl];W[el]
(;B[gk]C[[EV\] Why not connect the other way?  W cannot do anything.]
;W[gm];B[hk];W[il];B[di];W[ci];B[dh]C[[EV\] Bad shape, loses liberties.  Just draw back to E11 or switch to A17.]
;W[ch];B[ej];W[ek]LB[fh:A]C[[EV\] Too submissive.  F12 puts B on the spot.  Last comment.]

(;W[dp]C[[EV\] Another possibility for W.  The continuation is from a pro game, so I presume it is equal :)]

C[[EV\] This continuation looks OK for both sides.  B normally plays this way when a B stone around D10 is already in place, but now B has sente to play there, so the result is similar.  (Note that W should exchange E4 for E3 before playing G5, to make the enclosing wall solid.)]
