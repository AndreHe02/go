;B[pd]C[I think that I probably could have picked up the 2 points needed to win this game several
 times, but white, no doubt, also had several opportunities to increase his score a small amount. Identifying these is interesting in this close game.

My biggest question is:  Is there is a better way to handle white's invasion of the bottom and reduction of black's central moyo?

Any other large conceptual errors that you can identify will help improve my game.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ch]LB[dh:A][cg:B]TR[dp]C[C -> this pincer is very rare. It does not mean, of course, that it is a bad move. A and
B are more usual. I would have played A in this position, because it works well with
the marked white stone.];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[ed]LB[eb:A]C[C -> this move should be at A. It leaves too many weakness]
;B[bb];W[db];B[jc]LB[ee:A]C[C -> A is a very important point for both players.]

;W[ee];B[df];W[eh]MA[ed][ee][eh][hc]TR[pd][pj][pp]CR[bb][cc]
[cd][de][df]C[C -> the white marked stones negate somehow the influence of black's. More over
the black rounded group is completely surrounded which is almost always bad so
early in the game.];B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[C -> not sure about this move. I prefer A here.]
(;W[cq]TR[pd][pj][pp]C[C -> because of the marked stone and the fact that white has to add an other move or more to secure the left size territory, I think it's better to play as in the variation. But
I'm not totally certain.];B[iq]C[C -> this stone is too low, it is not really effective in this position. That's why I don't
like d2.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[nf];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[jd]
