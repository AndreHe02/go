C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game, i don't know why i lost it, maybe i should have spent some time counting.
If you notice something looking like a mistake please tell me. :)]

;W[id];B[jq];W[qj]C[Big points. If W wants to play a moyo game, D10, but Black is looking too strong (this type of play would make the low K3 stone bad).]
;B[ql];W[qg]C[This is ok... but think how much better this stone would be in the variations of M17.]
;B[qe]
(;W[pk]C[[Blue88\] What's the best way to get out there? Q9 looks ok i think, but i don't like the idea of a Q9-Q8 exchange.

[Malweth\] you could play Q8 first, otherwise playing out at P13 or P10 are normal moves (Both allow B to make moyo in the LR corner).]
;B[cj];W[ch];B[cm];W[fp]C[[Blue88\] Is F4 ok? I wanted to attack the 2 black stones on the left as well as build up some influence towards the black group on the right, but in the other hand it gives me no territory

[Malweth\] It is almost impossible to make territory in the LL corner. The only way is to play C3, but this is cowardly and against the purpose of the D4 stone (outward influence).

Because of the K3 stone, playing C12 was bad - this should have been at C6 or C7.

Now it is probably best to protect at C5. This builds the best influence against the C7 group. It is impossible to attack K3 currently, so if this is your aim, attacking C7 first is important.]
;B[bp]C[Now C7 is safe and W is being attacked. W has a chance here, but shape will be concentrated and small.]

(;W[em]C[This gives black the LL corner 100%.]
(;B[ej]C[this move is not great for B... B should play C3.]
;W[di];B[dj];W[ip]C[This move is probably better around H3 or C3. The high stone aims for a center moyo and this is impossible now.]
;B[jp];W[io];B[jn];W[jo]C[If you push...];B[ko]
(;W[pl]C[Probably better for B to not respond to this... the cut hurts too much.

This is also big, though.]
(;B[pm];W[kn]C[the cut is good];B[lo];W[km];B[im]
(;W[jm];B[in];W[ml];B[gm];W[fl]C[[Blue88\] This move makes me feel strange, on the one hand it cuts the 2 black groups, but on the other hand it forces black out. Is that ok?

[Malweth\] It depends on what you want. Chasing the black group is probably good. It will give you some moyo potential in the upper right. Black's thickness in the corner mars this.

The only worry is that the F4 group is getting weaker. If you feel you need to _escape_ with F8, it is important to defend locally first (C3, J3).]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik]LB[ll:A]C[A is now a problem, isn't it?]

C[[Blue88\] Was sacrificing the (triangle) marked stones right? They seem to be important cutting stones, but i feared that not only the black (square) marked stones might get out, but also my stones in the lower left might die.

[Malweth\] The triangle stones ARE important cutting stones, however, black can connect the square group anyway. It is better to save the corner group. See variation.]
;B[ho];W[ki];B[qc];W[dc]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[[Blue88\] Is there a difference between A and B?

[Malweth\] Yes. A is the better side because J16 is further away.]
