C[Dear Reviewer,

 Here's one of my recent games on IGS. (I play black.)

 Being surprised in joseki, I thought I recovered but then W used his center influence.
I was pressing a weak W group, but it eventually broke free. The game ends with my blunder.

 I really appreciate the time you put into this, and hope to get some idea of what I was doing wrong.

 Regards,
 Oleg.

This was a difficult review for me early in the game. You have done some good post-game analysis and the questions that you ask early in the game are too difficult for me to give sure answers. Later in the game, your strategy is to capture a large group. You give this goal too much single minded focus. Throughout this segment you are leaving weaknesses in your own positions. However you do end up with a viable group to reduce w's large left side and a good piece of the top.  Then you make 2 huge mistakes. One is lose the stones at the bottom and the other is to allow w to invade your top. The game would be close if not for those.

Mark];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[ec];B[eq]TR[ec]C[Would a high approach (E4) have been better?

I am not sure, but a high approach would tend to prevent w from making a wall in the lower left to face his triangle stone.]
;W[gq];B[eo]C[i'm not sure it's the right fuseki.

W's plan is clever: try to build walls on both ends of Left side]
;W[dn];B[cq]C[not sure about this one either

(joseki dictionary mentions J4 and D8 as possibilities)

The game move looks a little questionable to me. W's reply seems good and creates 2 possible cutting points.]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[hq];B[bp]C[W can't F5 now, but can later]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[fo]LB[kq:A][lq:B]C[
I am trying to decide how or if w should avoid sacrificing his 3 stones. Maybe he should save the cut and jump out now to A or B. He could let you worry about your weak stones while he fixes his own.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[go]C[J5 didn't work, also considered H5

Doesn't this look a little awkward for Black?

 -- next I think G6 would've been better for W

Yes it does, I am not sure that G6 is better. The game move gives w a strong position on the left.]

(;W[fn];B[gn];W[fm]C[
This is another point for w to consider a different move. If he plays on the bottom, b can force at F7 and w is smaller on left, but secure on the bottom.]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[io];W[jp];B[hr]C[ok i win local battle, but W got 2 walls
(+ some aji to show later)

You might be right, in saying that w gained in this corner, but not so much so that b should panic.]
;W[nq];B[oo]C[i wonder now if Q5 or P4 were better

B wants to stay high here

Also, keeping in mind that W G7 is sente... should B play G7?

I like Q5. The game move seems to attack a pretty secure w group, while leaving some b weaknesses. G7 is a good but not urgent move to keep in mind.]
;W[op];B[pp];W[no];B[on];W[gm];B[in];W[ql];B[nn]C[
This move seems good to me, but it is a lot better if it makes the pincer work later.]
;W[mo]
(;B[qn]LB[qi:A]C[looks too defensive here

Yes,  i  like a pincer around A or some kind of invasion into w's left side before it gets too secure. However I see that the pincer does not work too good.]
;W[qf]C[this is unpleasant]
(;B[nd]TR[ql]C[i also thought about a pincer R12

The game move seems natural. I would be nervous about the pincer, but maybe it would work since w's triangle stone would be weak.
I think the other pincer at R10 might be better.];W[rd];B[qh]
;W[qc]C[ok joseki is now R15]
(;B[qj]LB[oh:A][of:B]C[too slow?
what if attack from top, P9?

I agree about the game move. You could also consider a jump to A. If w plays at B, you could then attack from P9 or so]
;W[ol]
(;B[ml]LB[nj:A][oj:B]C[wasn't O8 better here?

Or just A or B. W is going to escape, but you need to see to your weak group too.]
;W[nk]
(;B[nh]C[B would like to run W to the top (not towards G7) but then B side is weak.

Here, I intended to link O16 and R12 groups but W stone at R14 is like a thorn

Your analysis is correct.];W[mk];B[lk]C[
Your are pushing w toward your weakness. This is only OK, if you really will be able to capture him. It is dangerous.]
;W[mi]
(;B[mh];W[lj];B[kk]C[B would like to take profit on both sides of this. However, the top profit is marred by R14 stone.

Yes and there is really no profit to be had in the region of the game move. The big moves are at the top and on the left.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kh]
(;B[df]C[i looked where he's runiing and it's here...
need to make a base here

joseki is D15 -- i think it is better

I think this game move is pretty good. It makes a w pincer too close to w's wall.]
;W[cd];B[di]LB[ci:A]C[maybe I ws too scared of W wall below, so wanted to stay high

low might give you more chance for some kind of base. I like A.]
;W[dk];B[kg]LB[ic:A][hc:B][cj:C]C[
I don't like the sequence that starts here. I still don't think that you are going capture w and the big moves are now at the top. This move is only good if it aims at something like A or B to follow. The stones on the left are a little weak. Adding C might help them. If w doesn't reply to C, it might be too slow.]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih];W[kj]
(;B[gd]LB[gc:A]C[simply to break the ladder, but the placement is a bit awkward

It is awkward, but the dual role as a ladder breaker and claim on the top is important. Interestingly,  A also works as a ladder breaker and is less awkward.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[nc]C[want to get the top

good];W[of];B[jf]C[the cut N13 will haunt me

Yes, I think protecting it now is urgent.];W[gc];B[hc];W[gb]
;B[ib]LB[hb:A]C[this is an odd one. Now I think would be nice to sente against N5 group.
P3? L6 is a nice holding move, too

Just play A.];W[ee]TR[df][di]C[W nice development. GnuGO still thinks B ahead...

I have trouble estimating the score of positions at this stage, but I think that the score is close, provided that you can keep the top and solidify the triangle group.]
;B[de]C[try to reduce corner -- isn't simply F13 better?

Or maybe C15 to widen your base, while attacking w's corner as much as this.]
;W[fe];B[dd];W[dc];B[fg];W[gf];B[ce];W[bd];B[ii]C[both attack and connection

This is good.];W[ij];B[hj];W[jk];B[ik];W[jj]
(;B[hk];W[jl]
(;B[lm]C[this is played very fast, but wrong.
L7 is the better alternative (?)

Yes, it is the vital point in this kind of shape.];W[km]C[this is a disaster]

C[OOPS!!!

yes];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[kl];B[hl];W[hm];B[lq]C[

same. w captures a stone and has to fill in 1 point, comes out even]
;W[ac];B[cf];W[ad];B[ch];W[hf];B[ig]C[J14 better?

(my spirits are deflated here by losing the big fight)

J15 is key point as you can see from next move.];W[ie];B[je]
