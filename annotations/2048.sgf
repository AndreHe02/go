C[Hello my name is Rogerio and I am dayafter playing black.

It has been some time since I improved my game, so any general hints would be apreciated.

I will go through some of my moves, but any time you want to feel free to give any comments.

Thanks :)

Frank: Hi Rogiero. 
I had a look at your game and made some comments here and there. I think you made one big -strategic- mistake, leaving your cutting stones around G16 weak during the first half of the game. For the rest, you could try to pay some more advantage to making good shape (something I have to do too...). Believe me, it pays off in the end.]

;B[be];W[dg];B[fb];W[gc];B[fc]C[F: You could leave the situation as it is and cut later, depending on the circumstances.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[hc]
(;B[hd]C[This move will prove to be weak later in the game, maybe I should have left the weakness at G16 for the future?

F: Yes, or you should extend the other way. See variation];W[id]
;B[ie];W[jd]
(;B[fe]C[F: This shape is not so good/efficient. See variation]
;W[cf]
(;B[cn]C[F: White 24 is not sente, but leavin your cutting stones alone now is dangerous. See variation]
;W[ck];B[fn];W[gp];B[cq]C[F: If you want to invade at 3-3, you shouldn't exchange 27 for 28. After playing out the corner sequence, it will look like as if 27 is caught on a big scale.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]C[This makes 2 weak groups, but since the left was already his I thought I could profit later on.

F: I don't understand what you mean. The left wasn't white up till now. If he plays a splitting attack now, one of your weak groups will be in big trouble.]
;B[bn];W[ao];B[eq]LB[fr:a]C[F: Better at a (F2). It's also gote, but leaves more options later on (you're not completely blocked off).]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[fk]C[F: There is the splitting attack.]
;B[di]C[F: Risky. It's still better to make you're cutting group stronger in the first place]

(;W[ci]C[F: See variation];B[ch];W[dh];B[cj];W[bi]
(;B[bj]C[F: The normal move would be D10. See variation];W[dj]

(;B[bk]C[F: If white just connects, you're in trouble. See variation.]
;W[ei];B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[fm];B[en];W[gm];B[gg]
C[F: G 14 or H 14 give better shape.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]
;W[qh];B[qg]C[F: Bad, makes white stronger. If you want to defend the corner, you should play R14. This leaves also less possibilities in the corner]
;W[ph];B[qk];W[je];B[if];W[kg];B[ng];W[ni]C[Now this seems like pushing him up to my weak stones... seems a lot like trouble.]
;B[mf]
(;W[li]C[F: Not necessary. Time to launch the attack on the black center group. See variation]
;B[lh]C[F: Premature, since your weak group around G16];W[kh]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[ki];W[ih];B[jf];W[kf];B[ke]C[F: Fighting spirit, but ...]
;W[le];B[kd]
(;W[jb]C[F: Good shape. If white plays hane, black can connect his G16 group. See variation]
;B[ld];W[md];B[me];W[lf];B[kb];W[lb];B[kc];W[jc];B[hh]C[F: A loss of over 10 points, and you still have to rescue your group.]

(;W[ig];B[ii];W[ji];B[hg];W[kj];B[gi]
(;W[fh]C[F: Better seal black in and make a huge moyo at hte bottom side. See variation]
;B[ee];W[cd];B[bd];W[df]C[F: Not necessary.];B[hk]C[I manage to live, he made some mistakes and the game gets really close, but I seem to lack a lot in yose.

F: Thje problem still is your weak group, but white is to eager to kill it. If he let you leve and seals off the bottom, he will have a much larger victory. Your yose isn't that bad at all, apart from one big mistake.]
