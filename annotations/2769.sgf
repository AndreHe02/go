Generally this is a good game for white.

Black takes the corners and gives white influence in the centre. Also black leaves some weak groups. More balance is necessary. 

However white misses an opportunity to win the game easily. With two weak black groups close by a splitting attack is the best move. Some thing will die or else white can build up a lot of territory either way he can win.

White's invasion at the top was blacks opportunity to grapple for the centre. Black had the territorial advantage but did not expend enough effor destroying white's centre.]

No. This white move is good. Generally these moves are bad for black. 

 Black has the option shown in the variation. When he choses the variation that cuts himself off from the black stones above this is bad for black as you now have a nice target to attack. See variation.]

Earlier you let black off the hook a bit. You might be right the two stones are not so important as black is quite strong. However this big problem is that you have given up all four corners and now allowed black to build a strong group in the centre. 

I count (always a good thing to do). 
White 41 +komi   Black 49  If you can make territory in the middle you will do well]

You should give up one stone for two, I think. See variation.]
