C[jlim:  Hi, I will be reviewing this game.  At time of writing, I have been on a hiatus from GO for a couple months, so I would estimate my rank as 12 kyu on KGS.  Please feel free to ask stronger players for a second opinon ^^.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[eq]C[I had intended this stone for the 3-4 point but i misclicked and since I don't have any fuseki memorized or anything decided to go along with it.]
;W[pd];B[dn];W[qm];B[qn]LB[pj:A][np:B]C[jlim:  Perhaps a wide pincer around A would be better.  You usually don't want to attack a stone by attaching to it.  Or if you want to further solidify the bottom side, B would work too.]
;W[pi];B[dh]C[I think you're supposed to extend the other direction from a shimari, but i was concerned about losing a third side. Is this the wrong way to think?

jlim:  I think this is fine.  If W plays on the bottom B can attack from both sides.]
;W[mq];B[or]C[jlim:  Overemphasizing the corner territory, but slightly forced because R6 was played.]
;W[mo];B[gd]LB[om:A]C[At this point I thought I'd make territory on the left side, then try to connect the lower right corner to that.

jlim:  I don't quite see how you hope to connect this to the lower right.  Suppose W plays near A?  The corner is quickly sealed off.  I like your reasoning, but not sure this is the best way to go about it.]

[mq]C[jlim:  I don't think this move is necessary.  Black should be able to live on the edge.  Perhaps a move at A could then threaten a followup at B, and Black could try attacking the marked White group.  

Another approach might be to aim high, perhaps at C, ignoring the bottom side, and allowing White to connect at B.  Black would then play near the center of the board, and hope to gain territory there.  

Note that the lower left corner could be invaded at C3.];W[ip]
;B[ih]LB[in:A]TR[id][dh]C[jlim:  Good idea, I like how the marked stones work together.  I feel that the area it encloses is too small, especially when you imagine the White group in the upper left corner trying to get in.  

Perhaps a play at A?  It would limit White's lower group, and aim to gain more of the center territory.]
;W[kh];B[hj]LB[jj:A][in:B]C[jlim:  You don't have to retreat in this case.  You could start to build a wall at A, or play B as mentioned earlier to build a framework.]
;W[jl];B[jj];W[kj];B[kk];W[ki];B[jk]C[jlim:  Very strong position for Black.  Black can run in and ruin territory, and should be able to defend his/her own.]
;W[mk];B[ll];W[mm];B[lm]LB[qc:D][ce:B][hn:A][hq:C]C[jlim:  Black has already been blocked, so a move elsewhere would have more impact.  

Perhaps A to solidify the center territory.

B to enclose the territory on the side while threatening White's group.  

C threatens the lower side, but should be soon followed up by securing the lower left corner.  Also, the lower side is not as crucial and White may choose to ignore it and run into Black's framework by playing A.  

D to gain territory as an endgame move.];W[jn];B[il];W[im];B[kl]
TR[jl]C[jlim:  This marked stone does not do much; it has little value.  Even if you capture it there are bigger moves on the board.  See variation.]

(;B[oo]C[jlim:  I don't see what you are trying to accomplish with this move.  If you are worried about the cut at Q6, a simple extension to R5 should allow the Black group to live in the lower right corner.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[af];B[df];W[ce];B[fe]C[I wasn't sure what the best move to defend here was.

jlim:  I think this move is good for sealing in the W group.]

jlim:  C12.  White is trying to live inside Black's territory.  Since White has nowhere to run, Black should attack along the sides, giving White no room to make eyes on the edge.]
