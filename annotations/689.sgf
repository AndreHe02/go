C[Over all, B misses several big opportunities.  Keep in mind, your focus is at the board level, not at the local level.  Also, one very common mistakes: Inconsistance.  Follow through your thoughts.  From what I saw, your skills are good enough; working on your concepts, you will imporve faster.  Of course, after you imporve your concepts, you need to imporve your skills to accompany it.  Good luck.

If any question, I'm Peninsula on IGS.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[oc];W[pj];B[cn]C[I expect White C4, Black C9 and White elsewhere...]
;W[gp]C[This is a surprise. Is this a good move?

It's not a bad move.  The lower side is somehow big because B could Q8/R8, W has to R12 -- B could take R3/R4 -- two wing expension.  That's the reason why W move to the lower side early.]
;B[cq]C[ I decide to take the corner ...];W[cp];B[dp];W[cr]
;B[bq];W[eq];B[do]C[E4.  B E4, W can't C4, because B has B2 (so B D2 or C5 become alternatives).  After B E4, W can't B2 (B E5) D5 either, because the liberity is too tight.]
;W[br];B[bp]C[Here, B used too many stones to catch one stone.  If C6 is at C8/C8; or D5 is at E4, B would be in a much better shape.]
;W[nq]C[As it turns out, G4 is a good move (W is building up at the lower side).]
;B[qm]C[I was not sure where to play here. Q6 and R6 seemed to slow to me.
Comments?

R6.  The reason is that B has an ugent thing to do: Reduce the moyo at the lower side.  So, B has to play solid so that there's chance to invade the lower side.  B doen't want to invad the lower side and been double played (the invasion force and Q4) -- that's the reason to play solid here.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[jp];B[qi]C[I liked to make an extension from my upper side and attack also the white stone. Maybe Q12 was better?

The mission now is to reduce the lower side moyo. M3 would be the move.]
;W[pi];B[ph]C[R12.  B's R7 group will be weakened if W R9 is sente.  if B R12, W R9, B could P8 to keep the attack position.]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[mi];B[gc];W[jc];B[lc]C[I attack the white stone in order to avoid that White can easily settle down here.

Actually, B is the one who is been attacked.  Put in mind that B wants M3; thus, B should settle down G17 ASAP to avoid any complication if B has a chance to invade at M3.]
;W[je];B[ge];W[df];B[db]C[B's previous comment: I'm attacking W.

If so, why not G13 or R13?  M17 & G15 is attacking, but D17 is to live?  Inconsistance.]
;W[cc];B[ib]C[I try to settle down my group here and then attack the K17 K15 group.

The idea is: If you are pursuiting W, no need to settle down.  Besides, chance for you to double play W's R16 & Q10 groups.]
;W[jb];B[le];W[ic];B[hb];W[cb];B[ec]C[Better at E18?

Better at L13 to cut W from each other.  B has G13 to run or E17/E18 to live -- to live is not the ugent task now.]
;W[fb];B[if];W[jf];B[gg]C[J13.  It's the shape.  See how bad it becomes for B when W gets J13?]
;W[ig];B[hf]C[J15 is the shape here -- gives you more space to make eyes.]
;W[lg];B[ch]C[This one is a good one.];W[cg];B[dh];W[fm]
(;B[fn]C[I think this was a big error. If I had played O5 as in the variation the game would have been still balanced.]
;W[gm];B[gn]C[Again not good I think ... :( ... pushing the cart from behind ...

This actually truned out to favor B.  Cause the F7/G7 is facing B's stones; thus, not potential of territory.]
;W[hm];B[no]C[I switch to play elsewhere.

O5 is still good, no problem of this move.];W[mp];B[oq];W[or]
;B[np];W[mq]C[W played this sequence because with B G5 in its current position, no gain in the center no more.]
;B[nh]C[Maybe a move at around K10 would have helped here ... ?
But I decide to cut now White into two groups and fight.

Hmm....  Looks like B N12, W M12, B M11 would work.  B has the strength at the upper right, no reason not to use it.]

C[N14 is the move -- save cut and seal territory.];W[ml];B[kj]
;W[ji];B[mk];W[nk];B[ll];W[mm];B[mo]C[It's more urgent now to live the center than to cut off W.  Once the center lives, W has all kinds of problems.]

(;B[hg]C[I think it would have been better to play at J8 (see variation) and continue to fight ... now White plays there and seals off a big territory and the game is over ... :(]
;W[il]C[From here on, it's hard to make comment move by move.  I'll stop here.  See veriations for some other explinations.]

(;B[il]C[I believe I still capture the White H11 group and now White has to be careful about the whole group L12, since I threaten to connect to the M8 group with my next move. In the ensuing fight I should be able to get some profit of reduce White's territory considerably ...

Comments?

Up to this point, H11 is just dead stones.  J8 is good thinking.]
))
(;B[no];W[mp]C[Why would W play N4?  W could M3.];B[oq];W[or]
C[Wishful thinking of B...  If W N6 here, B P3 W O6 -- the center grows even bigger.  If B O6 (responds to W N6), W P2, B achieves nothing.]
;B[np];W[mq];B[im]C[I believe this move is good since it reduces the possibility of white to make any territory in the center and puts pressure on the top group which is still floating without base ...

This move is actually too deep.  B's stone is far awaw from each of the groups.  Besides, G17 is not alive for sure yet.  W E13/F12 to cut off, and then B has two groups in danger.  OR W could pursuit J7 from F9, J7 would make a move to go home; then W could C9 -- the left side is wasted.  This kind of move will work only if you don't have weak group to worry about -- which you do for the time being.  Therefore, it's too deep.]
