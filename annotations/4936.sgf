C[Hi. My name is Alfa (17k) and this is my game against other player in IGS who is stronger than me, so I got reverse 6.5 komi. In the end I won by 1.5 point, but I feel I played very passive. I almost drenched by his/her moves.

Please help me.

[ck:A][cl:C][op:D]C[[Broege: The bottom-left corner is not finished yet, Black needs one more move to settle there. Usually Black plays A. B is slightly too far as the stones can be cut at C.
As for why Black has to add a stone - imagine White A or C - Black has to run into the center while White will attack taking territory both on the bottom and on the left side. Please remember not to leave your groups weak.

Assuming that Black is settled on the left I would approach this corner either from the top or (more likely) on the fourh line (think D). This prevents the move White played in response which aims at shutting Black off the center and influence.\]]
;W[po];B[qq]LB[mp:B][lq:A][rq:C]C[[Broege: Why not simply A which is secure or B for a fight (search for Shusaku Joseki for more info)? 
Playing here only strengtens White which can attack the newly added stone while reinforcing own stones.
As an exercise try to think what should Black do after White C?\]]
;W[nc];B[qf]LB[lc:F][ld:E][pf:B][pg:C][qg:A][ql:D]C[It's a bit strange by looking the potition in the right bottom. should I continue attacking there or this is correct?

[Broege: As White has left the bottom-right corner you don't have to play there. As for answer here - the move played and moves A, B or C are often played, depending on global context. Personally I prefer B but I'm too weak for it to be more than just a matter of preference.

Because White can easily extend from the bottom-right corner (at D for example) perhaps a pincer (i.e. E or F) is more appropriate - this way White will have to run into the center and fight and Black will settle on both sides. The move played allows White for an easy way to settle on the top (which not always is a bad thing).\]]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[[Broege: This is the same sequence as in the bottom-left corner but with a single difference - White did play the necessary stone and is quite safe now.\]]
;B[gc]LB[pf:D][pi:B][pj:A][qj:C]TR[qf]C[[Broege: Perhaps extending at A, B or C would be better as it would give Black group more space. Of course after playing C it would be better if the triangled stone was at D.

The move played does not attack White in any way nor closes the corner - so White can easily ignore it (as he did).\]]
;W[qh]LB[qj:A][pl:B]C[[Broege: This seems like an overplay. White should approach with more respect here (A perhaps) - Black still would be cramped while White would be perfectly safe and happy with territory on the right side (imagine White B next).\]]
;B[qj]C[[Broege: Good. Overplays should be punished.\]];W[cf]
LB[cd:A][ci:B]C[Another strange move I think...
why white didn't answer in P12

I think it'd be harder to me

[Broege: Perhaps White didn't want to fight yet. Or he wanted sente to decide the course of action. When playing a weaker player it's sometimes preferable to leave weak groups as probably the weaker player will not be able to attack them with force enough. Of course whie playing even or better player this is not recommended - in general having a weak group means that the opponent can dictate what's going on.

Now White is planning to settle on the left side. He probably expected for Black to close the corner in an automatic answer (A) so White can extend to B. Extension to B would also put some pressure on Black stones in the bottom-left corner as they are not settled yet.\]]
;B[ch]C[[Broege: Nice move. Black didn't fall for the obvious move of closing the corner.\]]
;W[ef]
(;B[fd]LB[fe:B][eh:A]C[[Broege: I don't think this is necessary - please check the variations to see what White can do here. 
Locally maybe applying some more pressure at White with A would be better.

Considering weak Black stones in the bottom-left corner perhaps playing B would be a fine way to settle all the stones by inducing White (see the variation).\]]
;W[gf]LB[fd:A]C[[Broege: Now Black is in trouble - still one stone is needed to protect the corner and the group is shut off from any further action. This is a direct result of an unnecessary move at A.\]]
;B[ic]LB[bd:A][cd:B]C[[Broege: I would advise closing the corner with A or B - this gives Black more territory - see the variations.\]]

(;W[rq];B[qr]LB[mp:B][lq:A][rr:C]C[[Broege: Black position is still weak. White can approach at A or B and give Black minimal space to live (Black C is necessary then).\]]
;W[bq];B[ck]LB[bo:A][co:B]C[[Broege: Of course White A captures the stone.
Black could have played A or B to protect the stone but I prefer the move played.\]]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[op];B[nq];W[mo];B[kq]LB[lp:A]C[[Broege: Perhaps Black should try to move into fourth line (A for example). Staying everywhere on the third line has two serious disatvantages:
1. Black makes less territory than he could.
2. (more important) Black has much less influence as he can be cut off from the center.
\]];W[iq];B[ko];W[qb];B[rb]LB[ql:B][qm:A]TR[qj]C[[Broege: Such moves are best left for yose. Black should care more about his weak groups (why not play A - it stabilizes the triangled stone and at the same time attacks White group in the bottom-right corner.
After White plays B the triangled stone will have to be protected and White will have some territory there.\]]
;W[rd]C[also a weird move I think.

[Broege: Yes, this is an overplay. Black is safe here.\]];B[rc]
;W[qe];B[rg]LB[pe:A]C[[Broege: This could be a very costly move for Black - please see the variations for possible answers by White. Black should have played A.\]]

(;W[fi];B[pe]LB[fi:A]TR[rg]C[[Broege: One move too late. Black is lucky that White didn't take advantage of this escape route.
Please notice that the triangled stone is almost unnecessary now. This means that White got move A for free.\]]
;W[rh];B[qm]C[[Broege: Good. At last all Black groups are safe.\]]
;W[rf]LB[eb:A][mb:G][se:E][fg:I][qh:F][rk:D][bl:B][po:J][er:H]
[mr:C]C[[Broege: Let's take a look at the balance of the game after these 50 moves. All the edges are more or less claimed.

Black has stable groups and probable territory around A-E groups. Should Black capture F group most of the right side will be his.

White has stable groups and probable territory around G and H. Group I is safe but it does not claim any territory of its own. Its best prospect is to connect with G and create big influence in the center. Group J is currently very weak and it needs to run into the center.
While will hope he can escape with his F stones so Black has two small groups on the side instead of one huge group.

As Black leads in the territory he should play safely and just neutralize White influence in the center. If Black fails to neutralize this influence White will claim quite large central territory.

From now on the comments will be centered rather on tactics than strategy.\]]
;B[sf]LB[qg:A]C[[Broege: It seems OK (very safe) but Black can also play A to weaken the two White stones below.\]]
;W[om];B[oj]LB[lm:B][ro:A]C[[Broege: As White group is weaker than Black, Black should play some more severe moves, attacking White as hard as possible. Think about a forcing move at A and bending at B to attack White group while gaining better access to the center.\]]
;W[mm];B[km];W[mk];B[oh]LB[mi:A]TR[qh][rh]C[[Broege: Again Black could use some more pressure on White. As the triangled stones are virtually captured Black can play at A to force White into more running and claim more territory.\]]
;W[rr];B[rs]LB[fg:C][nm:D][bp:B][pr:A]C[[Broege: This move is not necessary yet - White hasn't got much to gain here (except for incursion at A). Perhaps securing B stone is more important.
Strategically Black should attack two weak White groups - C and D.\]]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[ap];B[qn]LB[ro:A][rp:B]C[[Broege: This is too soft. Black move at A is still connected and it threatens a cut at B so it can't be ignored.\]]
;W[ro];B[rm]LB[rn:A]C[[Broege: This is very strange. If Black wanted to protect the second line - why not just A?\]]
;W[jb];B[ib]LB[dg:B][hp:A][jr:C]C[[Broege: White plays all the sente moves he has. Black should try to find some sente moves on his own to thwart at least part of White plans.

Take a look at A, B or C and try to check whether White can ignore them.\]]
;W[kr]
(;B[jr]LB[lr:A]C[[Broege: Black has fallen into White trap. Playing securely at A would be better - see the variation.\]]
;W[jq];B[lr];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[jk]LB[kk:C][hn:B][ir:A]C[[Broege: Black does not have to run yet.
It is best to take what yours after the opponent has gained some advantage.
Black can play A which should not be ignored by White (as it would open most of White territory there for an invasion.
Black can always escape at B so it's not or C so he does not have to choose one of the directions that quickly.\]]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[jo];B[jn];W[io];B[in];W[en];B[jh]LB[gl:A]C[[Broege: This stone is only loosely connected to the running Black group. Perhaps it would be better to enforce it first with a move like A (which threatens connection to the left side) and then run.\]]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[gl]LB[gm:A]C[[Broege: Why not just A?\]]
;W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[co];W[cp];B[bl];W[bg];B[bh];W[ia];B[ha]
;W[ja]
(;B[gb]LB[jc:A]C[[Broege: Black could play A first as it is a sente move - see the variation.\]]
;W[ab];B[ca];W[is];B[np];W[no];B[mp]LB[kn:A]C[A wasted move...

[Broege: Not really. Rather connecting at A was a wasted move - it gave Black almost nothing - only one stone saved in gote.
This move may be seen as a forcing move which protects Black group as it has no weaknesses now.\]]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[hh];B[hj]LB[li:B][el:A]C[or K14 better?

[Broege: Personally I would try to connect to the left side at A or to the right at B.
But first it would be good to attack White group in the top-left quadrant - it is very weak and only loosely connected.\]]
;W[el]C[[Broege: Now Black group on the left side is alone and has to live small.\]]
;B[jf];W[ej];B[di]LB[cg:C][dk:A][dm:B]C[[Broege: This does little to gain eye-space for the group. How about C first (it's sente) and trying forcing moves at A or B.\]]

[Broege: You played well for 17 kyu. To play better try to follow the next few general advices:

1. Don't play soft moves Always try to find a move which hurts your opponent the most. If you play soft moves your opponent may simply ignore them and force you in another area of the board.

2. Don't leave weak groups unsupported just to play elsewhere. Such groups can be attacked by your opponent either to create territory or influence.

3. Don't play small moves in the beginning. There were just a few but it's best if there are none.

4. Don't play unnecessary moves - especially in yose. If you do so - your opponent will take sente and gain points with each move.

5. Don't answer all moves of your opponent - sometimes it's good to ignore even a sente move and attack elsewhere (if you can gain as much as you loose) - so at least you thwart the plans your opponent made. If you follow the plan of your opponent you will never take initiative.

6. Try to solve some life-and-death problems so your reading will become better. It always helps.

I know it's easier said and done but at least one can try...\]]
