C[Commented by Cristiano Chris.sado@tiscalinet.it
Local rank (Italy)  8 kyu.];B[dp]C[I apologize if you just know that, or if my  program doesn' t read well the coordinates, but it is an ancient japaneese tradition to  play the first move on the upper corners, as a sign of respect of the other player.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[pd];B[jp];W[qm]C[Ithink it' s better to play the kakari at r6  than play at 6.
However,6 is good to prevent a possible extension of the san-ren-sei on the right side.]
;B[pj];W[om];B[qf];W[pg]C[It' s also interesting to play o16-s16-r17
with a black estabilished group on the  right, with black in sente, but with a white
territory on the upper side and an invasion.
10 isn? t a plier (which is one step below) and
isn' t an extension of 4, because black can  divide the two stones.]
;B[qg]C[It' s usually a bad idea to make a territory with stones on the third line; in this way you make about eight-ten points, but you give a beautiful  moyo to white, which gives him a great influence on the center and on the high side.
>From the point of view of 7, it' s better to play  11 at Q14 to divide white and to attack both the corner and 10.
The plier on O17 is also possible.];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[qj]C[If 16 is played at Q14, white has a great moyo and a very good game.]
;B[pk];W[qk]C[It' s little to save this stone.
Better is to play at 19.];B[pf];W[ni]C[Very well: white jumps to save the three stones and both attacks the two black stones below.]
;B[nk];W[mm];B[nf]C[Good move !
Black extends his group making week the four white stones (which means to defend undirectly his group of three stones) and both he threatens the corner !]
;W[nd];B[rd]C[Perhaps now the corner is little.
White lives in the corner also without playing at 25, and there are many bigger points.
For example, black can make amove to consolid his weak group, or he can make tenuki.
25 makes only about 10 points (if white doesn' t replies).]
;W[qe]C[A little unuseful, because after 27 tgives only to blach some aji and ko threatens.]
;B[re];W[qc]C[To make tenuki or to extend your weak group isa better.]
;B[lj]C[Good.];W[mj];B[mk];W[lk]C[It' s good idea to defend your stones cutting black and starting a fight for life !
(And it' s also very funny).];B[ll];W[kk];B[ml];W[li];B[nj]
;W[kj];B[km]C[Now both groups qare alive.
In Go , when thereare two weak group near,
botrh them will survive.];W[ln];B[jn]C[Black is escaped, but his stones begin to be a
string, which is the worst form in Go.
At the contrary white has used his influence to make some good forms and to close a corner and to consolid his invasion on the bottom right corner. He has a good game, because of 9-11-13-15.]
;W[np]C[Perhaps, it' s time to take the corner with R2, because 40 will reduce black' s moyo.]
;B[nn]C[M3 to make territory on the lerft and then to fight to live in the corner.]
;W[nm]C[White 45 is a winning move !
If black plays at 44, white 67 will win all the corner and the bottom part of the goban.
If B P3,W 44 or WO3 let B lve, but very, very small.];B[oo]
;W[qo]C[After W 67, 43 and 45 are dead and the game is end.]
;B[qp];W[op];B[ro];W[rn];B[lo]C[After BQ5 WR6 Bn5 Blach lives With other variations B makes one eye and it' s W turn to suffer for living.]
;W[ko];B[oq]C[Q5-R6-M4 starts a good fight for black.
If BQ%-WS4 BR6 WS3, I am sure that B will kill some of white stones.]
;W[nq]C[Good ! Now white liberties will become more than Blach.]
;B[po];W[qn];B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[mo]C[The final cut !];B[kn]
;W[pq];B[mn];W[lm];B[kl]C[Unfortunately White 64 was sente ...  ... or no ?]
;W[or];B[qq];W[qr];B[mr];W[mq];B[lq];W[nr];B[lr];W[kd]C[White has killed all black group and has sente.
74 is quite big, but 105 (m16) and 90 (S17) are miai (for life).
So, it' s not necessary to play here.
I suggest 137 (C11) or a move on the upper left corner.];B[fc]
C[If the game is quite equal, It' s better to approach the corner from the oyther side, but now it' s a good idea for black to play at 75 to start a difficult gama trying to equalize.]
;W[hc]C[Great ! Also if now it' s possible to have a fight, white is good on this part of the goban, thanks to the hoshi-stone and to his influence on the center.]
;B[fe]C[I suggest to play at C14, with the idea of invade the corner or to build up a moyo on the left.]
;W[df];B[hd]C[White has 42 points on the lower corner,  about 25 on the upper side (even if an invasion is still possible) 15 points on the upper left corner and sa little in fluence on the center.
Black has only few points on the right side and  many in fluence in the lower left (about 35, but white can invade).
So, it' s too slow to make a little invasion here  helping white to build up a moyo, because, also if the moyo doesn' t make points, it consolid white' s position on the high side.
It' s very riskious, but useful, to invade on the upper right corner, or to extend the territory on  trhe down left.
75 and 77 will fight to live in a second time (and only if white will attack them).
Who is loosing has to make often tenuki to force the other player to loose points replying.]
;W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[if];W[jf];B[ig];W[jg];B[ih];W[si];B[rh]
;W[rc]C[White is many points up, so that calm move is good, but an approach on the down left corner is bigger, because it can try to reduce black enormous territory in that zone.]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[og];W[oi];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh]C[With L12 black can try to divide white (but I? m not sure it' s possible).]
;W[kh];B[lf]C[The lower corner is bigger.];W[oe];B[of];W[lg]
;B[mg];W[kg]C[It' s only a point or few more !
It' s better to make tenuki.];B[ld];W[me];B[mf];W[le];B[kf]
;W[ke];B[eg]C[Good, black now is less bad.];W[dh]C[Until now, white and black has played above their theoric strenght, but now they make two horrible moves : You mustn' t leave a hole between two stones when a group can enter.
Black could have cut white with many complications.];B[dj];W[ei]
