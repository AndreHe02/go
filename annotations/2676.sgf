C[Hey Jonathan -

I'm John, and my level is ~4-5kyu.  Your game was honestly a real pleasure to review because I have been unable to play the whole summer and I've been itching to do something Go related!  So thanks to you :-)

Anyways, so I've made heaps of comments, and I hope you will find them helpful.  A general summary is at the end.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by e-mail, or look me up as 'etrynus' on KGS once I get my internet back...

Regards,
John];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[ee]C[Hmmm... even I had to look this up, since I don't think it is commonly played.

E15 turns out to be a trick play of sorts, and the correct response by B should lead to a slightly favorable result.  The joseki is shown in the variation.]

(;B[cg]C[This move falls into the white trap, since it leaves the corner.]
;W[cj]C[White should have happily taken the corner at C17 or C16 for an early lead.]

(;B[eg]C[>> Aim for the corner instead or pincer perhaps of the c 10 stone?

You can probably gather from my previous comments that B should settle in the corner already!  I still like C17 at this point.

A pincer of the C10 stone is a bad idea - see variation.];W[ge]
C[take the corner.. blah blah blah];B[cc]C[Yes!];W[cb];B[bc]
;W[jd]C[>> Peep at f 16 and then try to push white out from under perhaps?

That is a good idea.  White's move at K16 is very thin, and his group can be easily attacked.  Look at the variation for a possible continuation.]

(;B[oc];W[nq]C[>> White's position on the top left is obviously too high, but I didnt want to risk getting hemmed in and having to make a weak group and being forced to make two eyes.  I thought if I secured the corner THEN attacked it'd be better but that's not how it worked out.  What could I have done?]
;B[lq];W[pq]C[This is a bad move - W will usually play R3.]
;B[qq]C[Good.];W[pr]C[The cut at R4, as you point out later, needs to be defended right away.  See variation.

Don't worry about M3 yet, with White's weak group nearby, it will be hard for W to effectively attack that stone.]

(;B[iq];W[qp]C[This is HUGE!]
(;B[rp]C[>> I lost the corner to  this cut, what would have been a better course of action?

First, I think B should have atari'd the other way as in the variation.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[po];B[op]
(;W[oo]C[W lost an opportunity here.  He should keep in mind that his R5 group is completely safe since R3 is captured.  See variation for a possibility.]
;B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[rn];B[rm];W[qm];B[sn]C[Try moving out at Q6 first before capturing the S6, to give yourself more opportunities.]
;W[pn];B[sq];W[rr];B[rn]
(;W[sp]C[Oooh... W lost big opportunity here.  See variation.]
;B[ql]C[Good.  Very good.];W[pm];B[qk]C[This move, however, is slow.  Better at R10, or possibly R11.]
;W[rj]C[This move is ridiculous.];B[qj]C[A good and solid response.]
;W[rk]C[Even more ridiculous than his last one!]
(;B[rl]C[Don't be so passive!  See variation.];W[qi];B[ok]C[I think this move is better at Q11, to put more pressure on the extremely weak white group.

Also, for future reference, if you want to jump out, it should be two spaces from a three stone wall (ie. at O9).]
;W[qf]C[Doh.  Painful for B that W made a living group here so easily.]
;B[lc];W[re];B[rd];W[md];B[mc];W[pd]C[*Rubs eyes*  This is a really poor move.  The exchange can only help B.]
;B[pc];W[jb]C[>> White is separated here, I could easily attack the connections but I couldnt figure out how.

How about this... (see variation)]
(;B[od]C[A slow move.];W[pe]C[W should just ignore and move somewhere else.]
;B[cm]C[It is beyond my level to say that this move is definitely bad, but I don't particularly like it.  It would be easier to play more simply.  If you want to emphasize attacking C10, then move C8.  If you want to emphasize the corner, move C6.  I would say this move is 'lukewarm'.]
;W[bl]C[This is a bad move.  In general, try not to shoulder hit a stone from below.  It will just make that stone stronger.  W should be jumping out, or shoulder hitting from above (D8).]
;B[co]C[>> Would jumping to the 3,3 have been better?

Another poor shoulder hit from below.  3-3 would be a good choice, as would a move like C8 or D9.]
;W[cp]C[Because of B's last move, C4 becomes a very good point for W, taking territory and attacking at the same time.]
;B[bo]C[This move has little value.];W[bm];B[dm]C[Slow.  Better to jump out at E7.  White cannot cut at C6.]
;W[bp];B[do]C[This move is painful for B, but it has to be made.  It is a result of the previous mistakes.]
;W[gp]C[W needs to protect his left group.];B[gr]C[B needs to protect his left group, by attacking the W group.  Both players ignore the left for a while, which is unadvisable.]
;W[fq];B[fr]C[The best way to reduce more territory is with the monkey jump at D1.

However, the best move for both B and W is still concerning the weak groups to the left.  E10 is a good point for both sides.]
;W[er];B[oq];W[or];B[mq]C[O2 is better.];W[nr];B[mr];W[gq];B[hq]
;W[jp]C[>> White used peeps on me constantly to hem me in, whats a more aggressive way to counter?

A more agressive way to counter would be J4 or J5 perhaps, however, K3 in this situation is fine.  The reason is that W cannot make much territory in the lower center because B has entry points at P9, N5, and G7.]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[fo]C[This move is questionable because I'm not sure what you are trying to do.  W's lower left group is already strong, so attacking it is useless.

If you want to attack W's left group, E10 is good, if you want to move out your own group first, G7 would be my choice.]
;W[eo]C[Poor.  Now B gets a chance.];B[en];W[ep];B[ek]C[Good.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[bi];W[bn]

;W[bk];B[dj];W[cl];B[dk]C[The last four moves were worth little.  The biggest areas are probably the top left, and the middle right.]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[hr];B[hs];W[ip];B[ir]C[Waste of a turn.];W[hl]

(;B[il]C[>> I'm clearly not making territory at this point, where are some white weaknesses?

Well, W finally patched up his F16 weakness, which was around for about 100 moves.  See the variation for a possibility.]
;W[hm];B[gk];W[ik];B[mk];W[lo];B[mn];W[mo]
(;B[nm]C[Slow.  No need to save the N6 stone yet.  If W tries to capture it, you can reduce elsewhere while he is trying to cut you.  See variation.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[ml];B[jl];W[kl];B[jk];W[kk];B[jj]C[ooh.  This looks harmless now, but later it turn out to cost you about 20 points.  When your stones aren't solidly connected like they aren't now, you should just capture, and remove the bad aji.]

The usual answer is N18, and O18 is another.  See the variation.]

;W[ij]C[>> Should have cut earlier at j18?

J10 is worth a lot, as is J18.  Both should have been played by both players earlier.]
;B[ll]C[Well, everything seems to be clear endgame from now on.  I see two remaining large areas on the board.

J18 of course, is worth about 20 points in gote.

D16 and then B18 (as in the earlier variation) is worth around 10 points in sente.

Remember sente moves are worth double gote ones.  And also remember that moves in the center are worth much less than they appear.]

(;B[nn]C[>> Upon look atthe final board, I see that my stone placement is extremely ineffecient, and that the final shape is far too heavy.  How could this have been alleviated?

I'm not sure what you mean about the final shape of your stones.  Check out the final variation I have for you, and my closing thoughts are below.


I think this game was lost simply because W took the bigger points before B did time and time again.  A good thing to do throughout the game (or every turn!) is to take a step back from the local situation and try to find the biggest point on the board.  That is the move you should be playing.

That being said, I think B had many chances to win this game, and W was far less dominating than you may have felt during the game.  W made a lot of overplays that were not punished.  J10, J18, A5 - W got there first on every one and ONLY won by ~30 points.  If B had gotten those first, it'd probably be B+50.

Anyways, my closing closing thoughts... I've talked a lot about sequences that were missed during the game, which may be hard to see.  So I've come up with a few moves during the game that I really didn't like, but that I also think you can fix right NOW.  Try to remember what you were thinking when you played these moves :-).

1) Move 49 (S8) - When you are peeped at, your first instinct should not be to connect, but to find some way to avoid connecting.

2) Move 101 (B10) - You must play A5 to cut, regardless of whether W can live after wards.  Making two eyes is expensive for W and you WILL take profit regardless.

3) Move 121 (J2) - Make sure you need to defend before playing a defensive move.  A waste of a turn in the early and middle game is worth at least 15 points.  And in this situation, it took little or no reading to find out that J2 was unnecessary!

4) Move 167 (J15) - Even a 30k will tell you that is suicide!  Take one second to check as to whether everything is connected before you move deeper in.  The only reason J15 survived was because W took profit elsewhere.]
