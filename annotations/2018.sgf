C[Hi there, thank you muchly for the review, I feel both me and my opponent played well this game, and I hope you will enjoy going though it.

 Im playing as white.

Hi Joshua, I hope my comments will be of some help for you.]

This move is generally not good in this situation. 

The purpose of this move is to make Black overconcentrated when you have already a stone around K4.

A move at C6 or D6 would be more common.];B[gp];W[dm]C[I know the 2 pt. jump here is not standard but I figured if my opponet tryed to exploit it I would live in the corner with the D4 group and pressure with the D7 stone to make a wall to work with my D16 stone.

----
Blacks G4 is not at the right place (should be F4). So he may not be able to invade the corner directly at C3 if you play correctly at D6.

I think with this two-space jump you give him more space for maneuvers than necessary. If he tries to invade at C3 your plan will not work.

Don't bother yourself with complicated plans at the first few moves. And never expect your opponent to play the moves you want him to. ;-)]
;B[jq]C[----
Black's shape looks a little bit cramped. G4 better at F4. This move here would then be correct.

With G4 a play at L3 is more suitable.];W[gn]C[I played this because I didnt like the thought of him getting so much influence with a similar play.

----
Generally the right approach. "Press the black moyo while expanding your own". But I feel this move comes too early. You could counter a black play here by playing around Q6.

In the opening it is better to first play in the corners, then play at the sides. I would try to establish a position at the right side first. Play an approach at one of the starpoints or just between them at R10.

Also this move is not a thread to Black. (the gap at H3/J3 is too small to invade). So you have to expect Black to ignore this move and play a big point at the side.]

Oh.

Black has helped you A LOT here. :-) Lucky you!];W[mc]C[I played a bit futher away from the usual O17 because it felt more connected with D16 and E8 groups.  Also, I felt my opponet was less likely to pincer because he would not know joseki for it at our level.  I felt a pincer would hurt me bad in this situation.

----
If you are afraid of a pincer then play at K16 for example. Works well with your strength from E8. 

Do not play lukewarm moves. With this move there is still plenty of space for Black to establish a position between D16 and N17]
;B[pf];W[qh]C[I played this to get into the big territory along the right side if black played anything about R13

And if he took something like R10 I would jump behind and make a push for the corner, which did happen as planed.

----
You were lucky that Black did try to defend the corner later. I think it would be better here to just establish a secure postition by playing at R9. R12 and R6 are then miai for you. To allow Black to make a large double-wing formation while putting pressure on you is big for him.]
;B[qj];W[ql];B[pi];W[qe];B[pe];W[qc];B[qd]C[-----
This is wrong. Black should block at Q17. If he wishes to play for territory he should play Q14 at R14 in the first place.

Black would build a HUGE wall. Wich would be worth more then the sealed in white group. He then could easily attack at the top.]
;W[pc];B[rc];W[oc];B[cj]C[----
Too close to your strength];W[ch]C[----
good];B[ej];W[dk];B[dj];W[fh]C[----
The two-sapce jump is a little bit thin. Just move out with one-space jumps. This would drive Black into the center without a base while White buuilds up a magnificient moyo at the top]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[eh];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff];W[fe]C[----
A lot of cutting points :-) I wonder why Black did not try to exploit them...]
;B[fi];W[gf];B[fg];W[df];B[gh];W[io]C[Was this move worth my while? It seemed good at the time..

----
I'd rather suggest to take care of the R8 stone somehow. You can also invade at R3 or reduce around O4.]
;B[ip]C[----
better L4 for example and Black starts building a moyo...];W[ho]
C[----
If you played J5 to reduce the lower side, this move is not consistent. Play K5 or maybe even L5. If Black cuts, you both will have two groups floating but I think you have the advantage here]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[jp];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko]C[----
Try a light move. E.g. at O4];B[ln];W[on];B[no];W[oo];B[op]
;W[np];B[mo];W[nq];B[oq];W[rp]C[----
The idea of giving up lost stones is good.];B[nr]C[----
Submissive. Better R4 or R3. I do not think the four white stones would be able to get 2 eyes.]

;B[dc]C[------
In this situation Black could easily live when invading at the 3-3 point, I think.

It is well worth remembering that an invasion at 3-3 under a starpoint almost always works. Even if D14 would be at C14 Black could get at least a ko out of it.]

I would try to exploit the weaknesses later.
For now it may be a better idea to reduce from the other side. At K10 for example.]
;B[mg];W[kd];B[ke];W[je];B[kc];W[kb];B[kd];W[jf];B[jg]C[I felt as though I made a mistake, or tryed to do something that just couldn't happen and it bleed all  the way over to the right hand side of hte board where it got secured by the edge.

----
Well, Black is much stronger here. Just reduce from the other side.

There may be possibilities. But don't waste your chance by just playing one atari after another. Only play here when you see a clear sequence. Otherwise just let the position stay as it is and reduce from the other side. Maybe you see a sequence later or new possibilities arise with new stones played.]

I made a comment at some move in your variation. Your sequence would not have worked. (Others maybe, but Black looks very strong)]

A good and interesting game. 

By just improving your reading skills, you would improve a lot.

Also remember to play moves which are a real threat to your opponent or otherwise do secure weak positions or give you a lot of points.
