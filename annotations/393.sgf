;B[qd]C[seppos: I wrote some questions and comments, I think mr. vinkupallo will do the same. Thanks for review in advance!

vinkupallo: Mr seppos is indeed correct.  To make the full importance of this semi-titanic struggle rightfully clear, I will tell a little story.  You see, we both are from this little city up in the north called Oulu.  I am 2k in the Finnish ranking system, whilst Mr  seppos is 3k.  Yet we both have the exact same EGF rating at the moment, viz. 1760 points.  So, you can imagine, quite a bit of our respective reputations (ha!) was at stake in this game.

 On to more serious matters ...

Hi! Thanks for the good comments and nice stories on the game :) I learned alot myself. This was my first review, so hope I didnt do too bad.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[vinkupallo: I always play the ni-rensei.  If this opening is one day "refuted" I will stop playing Go!  Seriously though, I do not feel I want to take the time to study different fuseki at the moment and I like the star points in general.  So, this takes the stress away for a short period of two moves.
  I would like to see the most comments on the moves that follow from here.  Especially the problems with direction that occur soon would be interesting to see covered in detail.  I can see what mistakes I make in the latter endgame myself, though if the Dear Reviewer wants to work out them in detail I will not complain.  But I rather you spent your time on the really difficult bits in the earlier part of the game.]
;B[fc]C[vinkupallo: I am not very good at countering the formation black could make with P16 instead...]
;W[id]LB[db:A][ib:C][cc:B][ld:D]C[vinkupallo: I have done quite well with this move in general.  Black's play surprised me, though.  Would it not be more active to play F15 or make a counterpincer on the left side?

Good and hard question vinkupallo. Most people play c14 here. I`ll give some variations as some of them are quite interesting but also very difficult. To say something about F15 and C17: C17 is of course a joseki. But maybe not so good in this situation because after the joseki white has the nice move of P16. I like F15 as it very free, you leave many options open. After F15 and D14 you dont have to play the joseki of Black A, white B and Black C. A pincer at D is also interesting.. (if you like fighting) I think you just should experiment with all the possible moves and see for your self what you like. In my opinion the opening of course has some basic rules, but also many moves are matter of taste.]

(;B[cc];W[dc]C[seppos: Was this right side white to block? Or is there no difference?

vinkupallo:  I do not have a stone at D10 so I could never make a wall pointing that way.  The difference seems to me between winning and losing already :-)

Yes seppos, vinkupallo is right. Blocking at C 16 is only interesting if white allready has a stone around D10 to support his moyo-in-the-make.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[vinkupallo: it's a joseki!]
;W[od]C[vinkupallo: I was happy to be able to make this move.]
;B[oc]C[seppos: I thought this joseki is all right for black. Pincer would be bad?

vinkupallo: This lets me take control of the upper side very well.  I was happy with the result I got.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[qf];W[fd]SQ[aa][ba][ca][da][oa][pa][qa]

[gc][hc][ic][jc][kc][lc][mc][gd][hd][jd][kd][ld]C[vinkupallo: a proper move, as I want to play solidly in the opening. I`ll just put some ugly marks on the board. To answer the question about the joseki un the upper left, black made a good decision. A pincer is too dangerous with white`s big wall to help him. Although I know how white feels know. "Wow this is becoming a nice upper side for me" But if we count teritory we see that black has 33 points and white 32. So about the same.]
;B[fq]C[seppos: Is this right direction?

vinkupallo: It certainly made choices very difficult for white.  I was thinking that both the left and right side are now not very valuable.  This would be because I've been told by suspicious & mysterious people that the low-lying stones at C14 & R14 make it so.
  I did not want to pincer for some strange reason, so I decide to ignore the kakari.
   yes this is the good direction, left and right sides are not so important. Vinkupallo is right in that. So I think its strange you make the kakari never the less. Pincer again is best here. A variation:]

(;W[qo]C[vinkupallo: ...and played here.  Now, it will take a little more than a few words to convince me that this is a bad move.  I thought that a pincer by black would be quite low in value here.  I felt that I would have plenty of opportunity to enter the lower side at my leisure and keep black from making too much territory.  The moyo on the upper side would grow later...
  Looks like a good move to me, but...

But i think this kakari is wrong direction.];B[op]C[good move]
;W[ql]C[vinkupallo: Wanting to keep my stones safe...

yes this is ok move, but still you are not so happy with a group here.. For black I think C6 is also wrong direction. Lower side is still very important. I`ll give an example:]

(;B[cn]C[vinkupallo: And suddenly I found myself worrying about how to proceed now.  So maybe the good move was not so good after all.  This is how it is with go for me always :)

pressing at f4 looks better in this situation than pressing at d6. see variation.]

(;W[dn]C[vinkupallo: Looks like the wrong direction.  But I am not sure I would have liked pressing at F4 either... playing E5 is also possible if you dont like pressing.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[jq];W[eq];B[fp]C[seppos: I thought this was nice result for black, right?

vinkupallo: I had been thinking about making the left side overconcentrated here.  But the problem is the fact that it still gives black territory.  And he's got some on the lower side too.  But let's watch as I go into action (hee, hee):]
;W[cm]C[by playing here you make black very strong and you never can attack them anymore. a bad move, if you want to protect the cut, d5 is better.]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[em];B[dl]C[vinkupallo: This sequence is my old favorite.  It takes care of the cutting point as black does not have liberties after d5-e5 to cut at e4.  Also, I am looking at pushing that way up there...]
;W[df]C[vinkupallo: Question is, is black getting over-concentrated here?  Or is this just a high-level strategy of losing gracefully by white?]
;B[cg]C[playing e 13 is better.];W[dg];B[lc]C[seppos: This seems to be a quite good invasion point...

vinkupallo: I wanted to play M16 first, but thought that making a weak group to harass would be more fun.  It does not look like *I* could put that thickness to any good use anyway; meanwhile black will connect by O18 and laugh all the way to the bank.

Haha, yes m16 is too submissive, n18 also looks like only move to me.]
;W[mb];B[ke]C[nice move];W[pe]C[vinkupallo: Forcing first, just to see whether I could try out some nice tesuji in the corner.  I think black should answer this though, speaking seriously for a moment.

yes connecting leaves a lot less aji.];B[qg]C[vinkupallo: Black leaves bad aji, so is this worth it?  I'd play R15 in a heartbeat here, or even after thinking.

right, I also would have played r15];W[jc]C[vinkupallo: So, at least the forcing move was answered.  Now I try to put black into bad shape.

good move.];B[kc]LB[kg:A]C[this is not good. black looks like he is leading so instead he should jump away very lightly with A. Gou Juan always tell us to leave or heavy bags when climbing in the mountains. M17  and L17 are heavy bags.]
;W[kb]LB[kg:A]C[L 18 is very safe. How about attacking at A? Maybe I`m too aggressive, but L18 can`t be good.]
;B[lb];W[la]C[vinkupallo: Yes, it is submissive!  But I thought that making myself very safe would be good and black has shape problems now.  Especially as he so wisely decided to lower the number of liberties he had... :-)]
;B[jb];W[ka];B[jd]LB[kg:A]C[still black looks like getting more and more heavy bags, still like to play at A.]
;W[ic];B[ie]LB[je:B][jf:A][lg:C]C[still want to attack.. something like White a, black b, white c]
;W[le];B[he];W[kf]
(;B[je]C[vinkupallo: Please see & comment on the variation.]
;W[ig]C[yes! very good!];B[hg];W[ih];B[gg]C[strange shape, but maybe very good. H12 would be normal, but than H14 might become a problem..?]
;W[gd]C[vinkupallo: see variation previously for why I did this...

Yes, now it becomes more urgent. So good move. Although it is a shame that white misses the move at g11.]
;B[gi]C[seppos: So it became heavy group but get away nicely. Invasion was ok?

vinkupallo: I felt I was falling behind too much at this point... but there was this weak group and I could maybe fiddle around elsewhere before coming back to torture it

Yes it came away ok, but next time you should try to leave some heavy bags when invading!]
;W[hq]LB[qp:B][rq:A]C[vinkupallo: So!  Time to stir up trouble and look impressive before I die..

wow, daring! the biggest point on the board is A for white and B for black. But stirring up some trouble is of course best when you are behind.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[gr]C[seppos: This threatened cut at D5. :)]
;W[er]C[answer at d5 maybe better?];B[hr];W[lq]C[vinkupallo: Deep, deep.  But I am hoping that the aji of the two white stones will prove decisive.  The two next moves by black flummoxed me quite badly, though.]
;B[lo]C[yes, perfect!];W[kp];B[jn]C[vinkupallo: Oh #Â¤&@! I am gonna die (so I thought).

yes black plays well here.];W[mo]C[seppos: This move caused much trouble to me and white got easy sabaki here. Maybe N6 would be better response to this move?
N4 is ok i think. see variation.]
(;B[lp]C[vinkupallo: Please note & comment on the variation (or the situation in general).]
;W[mp];B[kq];W[on]C[seppos: Now my corner seems vulnerable. :(

vinkupallo: I was happy with my result now.  It started to look like a game worth playing again.  Please note how carefully I try to save the aji of L5 or M6 for later.  Don't I look cute or what? :-)]
;B[qp];W[ro];B[mr]C[vinkupallo: This move turned out to be a nasty surprise.  I thought I could keep black separeted more easily.  But at least I got sente, so my shoddy reading did not kill at this time...]
;W[mq];B[lr]C[seppos: Black got his groups connected, but white did some reduction and got sente.. still seems good game for black? yes black has more points.

vinkupallo: Hmm...];W[fh]C[vinkupallo: I read out some variations after w c12 and b d12 and did not like what I saw.  So, I thought, let us peep and see what comes of it.  It gives me C12 for later too.]
;B[hi];W[hl]C[vinkupallo: This seems to be a move of little value... ?  But I wanted black to push me to the edge.]
;B[fi]C[vinkupallo: like this.  Is it magic or just bad go?]
;W[ch];B[di]C[vinkupallo: This peep is such a simple move but it annoyed me quite severely.  I did get my stone at C12, at least.]
;W[dh];B[el];W[rh]C[seppos: Really big.

vinkupallo: I am aiming at the aji of thrusting and cutting at R15, of course.]
;B[qh]C[seppos: This seems bad now, when I was playing this felt good. :) Aji keshi?

vinkupallo: Maybe black S13?  Trouble was with R13 much earlier, though, as far as I can see (but that is not very far in general :-).]
;W[ri];B[rg];W[ob]C[vinkupallo: Still with my eye on the aji in the corner.  I was expecting black to answer this directly.]
;B[qi];W[rj];B[nn]C[seppos: This move was too aggressive.

vinkupallo: I hated it nonetheless.  Or maybe it was the 15 minute lag we got at this point... Sheesh!]
;W[no];B[oo];W[mn]C[vinkupallo: My idea here is that black will gain Q6 anyway.  I want to save the aji of the L4 stone as long as possible.
  W q6 b o7 was too difficult to trust.];B[pn];W[nm]C[here black first should play  P7.]
;B[po];W[qm];B[mg]C[vinkupallo: As to why black did not cut, I have no idea.  I was worried about the weaknesses here and now I could correct them, though in gote...
Yes cutting is very severe, also because black can cut at Q7.]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[lf];B[ne];W[nd];B[ko]C[vinkupallo: And finally black thought the aji was too much to bear.  That is what I think he did, anyway.
M6 takes more points.];W[qb]C[vinkupallo: I really liked to spend time & moves on this corner.  At least the product is a weak group, eventually, so it all does not go to waste.  Or?]
;B[pd];W[oe];B[pb];W[pa];B[rc];W[og];B[oh];W[pg];B[nh]C[vinkupallo: Perhaps I missed the severe cut at O12.  But I did try to keep the possible weakness of the O7 group below in mind.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[oj];B[oi];W[rb];B[pm];W[nj];B[mi];W[jj];B[lj]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[lm];B[kk];W[ml];B[lk];W[pl]C[vinkupallo: I did not see a possible kill anywhere, so I wanted to take it easy and keep myself safe.  I felt that I had caught up by attacking the weak group.  And it was fun too, as well :)]
;B[jl];W[km];B[jk];W[jm];B[ij];W[rq]C[vinkupallo: This move signals that I move into the endgame.  And what an awful endgame it turns out to be, but I manage not to lose.  Or maybe black managed to lose.  What do you suggest, Dear Reviewer, about the state of the game now?

Ok, I`ll try to count, although I`m bad at it. Black: UL: 10, LL: 6 Lower side: 24 Total 40 points.
White: upper side 15, right side: 13, LR: 12. Total 40 points. :-)]
;B[rp];W[sp];B[qq];W[rr];B[qr]C[seppos: White steals another corner. Unfair. :)

Yes black was a bit unlucky in this game. I`ll stop here commenting. I think the main mistake in this game was the way black treated his group on the upper side. (and the submissive play by white there)
Have fun, maybe we meet some day on igs.];W[lh]C[vinkupallo: S1 was a big move for a long time.  I did not fully appreciate the effect of black R6...]
;B[mh];W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[bn];W[do];B[bp];W[bq];B[aq]C[seppos: Two blunders in row.. please no comments for these moves.

vinkupallo:  I had not read this situation out at this point, which was very careless of me.  Luckily black had had some trouble with reading too :-)]
;W[ar];B[br];W[ap];B[bo];W[cr];B[qn];W[rn];B[pj];W[pk];B[mj]
;W[om]C[vinkupallo: I have my eye on the black group's weak point.  And soon...]
;B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[fb];B[hd];W[hc];B[fl];W[oq]C[vinkupallo: Here we go!  I was still worried that depending on how black plays he will later get S1 and I cannot fight a ko and I will lose the corner back (and the game).     The thing is that it is much easier to attack than to defend, much too often.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[np]C[vinkupallo: aji keshi, of a minor short.  Just R1 better?]
;B[pp];W[qs];B[pr];W[in]C[vinkupallo: perhaps j8 would have been better, as it would have made K11 sente?]
;B[io];W[hn];B[gk];W[cj];B[dj];W[be];B[ce];W[af];B[bd];W[ae]
;B[ad];W[ag];B[ba]C[vinkupallo: to avoid a seki, of course]
;W[rs];B[ji];W[re]C[vinkupallo: is T18 just bigger and better?  I can't trust my judgment here.  Besides, I had read the situation out wrong before and thought that black could make a big ko after this.  Turns out he couldn't, so I jumped in with relish.  (Awful playing.)]
