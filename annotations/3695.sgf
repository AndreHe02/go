C[Thankyou in advance for offering to review this game for me.

I felt white gained an advantage over me early in the game, but I don't really understand where I made the mistake to let this happen. Obviously, I'm hoping this review will shed light on something to help me improve my go.

-Ben


-->Hi, Sorry about this, but right around move 217, I somehow deleted the main line of play, had to reenter it by hand, and realized only at the end that I'd missed the first move -- the result was b winning by 0.5 rather than the actual game in which white one by 1.5.

As for overall advice... I'd say you should concentrate on thinking about the balance between yours and your opponent's moyos.  You need to find those critical points that are crucial for you both.  Other comments are tied in to the moves themselves.... Hope this helps!]
;B[pd]C[Benjimin [9k\]: hey
kazusan [9k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp]C[I really have no idea at all about fuseki. This is a problem for me. Any early-game comments much appreciated.

-->so far, so good];W[qj];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[iq]C[-->w helps b here.  This kind of low shoulder hit is usually a bad move.]
;B[jq];W[cq];B[ck];W[qn];B[np];W[qf];B[pf]C[--> w has bad shape on the right side -- he is overextended from the center in two directions, and all of his stones are on the third line.  Here you help him get stronger by attaching to his stone.  The defensive move at p17 seems more natural to me.  The instinct to make him overconcentrated is good, but that would work only if he already had tight shape.  If you just play away, defensively, he either has to come back and fix up in gote, still leaving some gaps, or you can totally invade once you are solid on the top right if he plays elsewhere.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[jc]C[--> a good sequence for w -- gets solid on his overextended side AND takes the huge point at k17 -- b has very little but the corner where he already had a stone.]
;B[ld]C[-->move leaves lots of aji, but in a 9k game that's probably okay.]
;W[cg];B[dc]C[-->good.  e18 also possible here.];W[ec];B[cc]
;W[ed];B[cd]C[b 15 slide more effective];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb];B[da]
;W[be];B[gb]C[was this bad?

-->not great - just helps w get strong and connected without making too many points -- gives him strength to invade top right easily.  Better to take territory and strengthen your top right around m17, THREATENING the k17 stone with this kind of move]
;W[gc];B[fa];W[fc];B[bd];W[hb];B[pn]C[-->same principle as before.  You could invade at r8!  Or you could just take your corner at r4 and threaten r8.  this move doesn't do much for you but help white.]
;W[ga];B[bb];W[ea];B[db];W[qq];B[qp]C[Is the other side better?]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[nr]C[--> not good -- full of holes and not actually defending much territory.  Something like r8, or else somethign moyo expanding like k7, threatening to take territory between the K and R lines 4-8.  Also, k15, expanding your mid/upper/right moyo and negating white's powerful influence is a good move.]
;W[lb];B[nc];W[bq];B[ql]C[->good.];W[oj];B[ip];W[hq]C[any comments about where black should be playing?

-->now, absolutely.  Look at the board.  Where is the most potential for b territory?  What about white?  Your next play in the middle of the board is an indecisive (slack) response that tries to compromise and both expand b and reduce w, but it is too far from either to be useful..  W can play safely on either side of that move.  You should probably shrink white's potentail and expand your upper right side around k15.  If w defends, keep pressure on (especially if you can threaten to creep in from your weak left side group, strengthening it and reducing white in sente) until it is gote for you to threaten to shrink his territory any more (that is, until he can ignore and still prevent you from getting more than a few points, then come back and expand your bottom with something around o8 .]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[kj];B[ok]C[-->small!  w capturing your center stone is huge; it makes your play there wasted in excange for capturing this single stone and having your huge moyo erased and white's potential increased.]
;W[ji]C[-->great by white.  now his center moyo is looking good]
;B[og];W[ph];B[oi]C[-->again, small!];W[rk];B[qk]C[->very bad move, just helps white.]
;W[ri];B[rl]C[white can live without responding.  b gets lucky.  ;-)]
;W[sk];B[rd];W[re];B[pj];W[ij];B[qi]C[this sequence turns out not to be sente. not sure whether or not it is good to play anyway

--<good sequence, but erasing w's moyo and helping your lower left group both urgent]
;W[rj];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[pi];W[dj]C[-->great move by white.]

(;B[fn];W[jk]C[-->white should have played k14.  if b runs, w can put lots of pressure on the bottom group first in sente, then come back and safely connect his center stones.]
;B[jf]C[-->key move.];W[ke]C[BAD!  Just helps b get stronger, now he can fully invade.]
;B[kg];W[mc]C[bad again - h14 huge!];B[hf]C[good];W[nb];B[oc]
;W[dm]C[Good move by white. B has to play c7];B[dn];W[em];B[cj]
C[You have to play c7 here.  W gets c10 in sente, but with 36 and some room on the bottom, plus the push at d9, b should all be okay.]

;W[fl];B[gk];W[in];B[hn];W[il];B[go];W[gp];B[eo];W[do]C[-->I have no idea why w gave up his f5 stone -- just connecting at f4 is fine.  If b plays away, the atari at h5 captures two stones, or all four if b connects.]
