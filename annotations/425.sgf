C[Hello

I would like to request a review of this game.  I am ~25 kyu (I think my rank on KGS, where I played this game, is too high as I 'accidentally' defeated an 8 kyu player) and I played black ('wysi').

I do know why I lost this game - I got pushed around too much and did not stake claim to enough territory.  I would like a reviewer to focus perhaps on a) what moves I could have made, apart from those I did make, that could have helped me to build territory (and perhaps crucially when I should have made the moves), and b) to point out any egregious mistakes I did make irrespective of my strategic problems.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Joe.
I'll try my best. My comments are marked with (morten), and I've put in a summary at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[jc];W[pj];B[qg]LB[cj:a][ce:b][de:c]
[fq:d]C[(morten)
This is OK. You get the double-wing formation which is good.
Other options are C10 ('a'), C/D15 ('b','c'), or F3 ('d'). Personally, I would probably have played D15 ('c')]
;W[qn];B[jq]LB[np:a][nq:b]C[(morten)
This is very far. normal responses here would be O4 ('a') or O3 ('b')]
;W[gq];B[dj]LB[cj:a]C[Joe's comment: It was at about this point when I began to feel that I might have trouble staking out some territory.

(morten)
Nothing really bad so far. There are other alternatives as well, which will all give you a piece of the left side. Without wanting to go into specific josekis, the chosen move is OK. Maybe C10 ('a'), one line lower is better   Look at the potential territories: two corners each, you have two half sides (bottom & top) and he has a small side on the right. Your last move will make the left split half/half, so you're in the lead.]
;W[ci]LB[cj:a]C[(morten)
This quite aggressive and really an overplay. His stone is only weakly connected to his upper left and not at all to his lower right. It does ask for a response, though, otherwise you will find yourself without anything on the left, and your stone at D10 goes to waste. Play at e.g. C10 ('a'). See vars.]

(;B[og]LB[rj:a][on:b][fd:c]C[(morten)
Very small. Your left side stone needs support.  In this situation, you really should respond around your lone left stone. Otherwise, there was no reason to play it to begin with.

If you want to play elsewhere, you should consider S10 ('a') - mostly territory, but also robbing his group of a base, P6 ('b'), also sente towards his right group and pressing his group low while building centre influence, F16 ('c') is sente towards his upper left corner and creates influence and takes territory.   The reason your move is small is because white can still happily take away your corner territory here (e.g. by an invasion at the 3-3 point) , and that the move is not sente (white doesn't have to respond).]
;W[oc]LB[pc:a][ld:b][ie:c][kf:d][fc:e][de:f]C[Joe's comment: From here I was hoping to contain white to the corner and not allow him to spread too far.

(morten)
This is not a very good strategy. Letting him take this corner will give him quite a large territory, and loose you the equivalent. Your stones are strong - you should attack him. You have four stones in the area against his single stone - it is he who should struggle, not make lots of territory :-)
A simple descent to Q17 ('a') will give him the headache of how to live. If he tries to escape with e.g. M16 ('b'), you happily play J15 ('c'), let him get out with L14 ('d') and then approach his corner gently with F17 ('e') or aggreesivly with D15 ('f')  .
If he had invaded at the 3-3 point I would have agreed with you, but not when he is 2 lines further out.]
;B[nc];W[qc];B[od];W[pc];B[qd];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb]
;B[kb];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[se]LB[rj:a][rp:b][on:c]C[Joe's comment: Was this move too conservative? Should I have attacked at  S17 instead?

(morten)
Attacking at S17 would not have made any difference - you would have been captured by White S18.
However, this move (T15) is probably not the biggest move on the board. Saving your stone on the left is more important, or extending towards the upper left.   During this exchange, your play was consistent with your initial thought - giving him the corner in exchange for outside influence. But was it equal? You have given him more than 40 points (approx. 12 points of territory which was yours and is now his + the stones placed inside what would have been your territory). To make up for that, your influence must be able to create more territory than you gave away.   Normally you use influence to create territory in other parts of the board. In this case, you should be able to use the influence you have to attack his right hand side group from the bottom, so that you end up with a large territory at the bottom.  S10 ('a') is the right idea but the wrong direction. S4 ('b') takes territory and robs him of the easy glide into the corner. P6 ('c') builds a moyo while pressing him down and building influence.

However, before you start chasing him into the centre, you should make sure that your lone stone on the left is strong first.]
;W[rb];B[ja]LB[ka:a][fd:b]C[(morten)
This move has no value and gives him sente.
If you really want to play here, then play L19 ('a'). But an extension towards his corner F16 ('b') is much better. You should never play on or below the second line unless there's a really good reason to do so.]
;W[ib];B[ic]C[(morten)
This is the best way to respond to his peep
:-)];W[hb]
(;B[ga]C[Joe's comment:  Not sure about this move.  An attempt to limit white on the top.

Could moves in the ensuing fight have been better chosen?

(morten)
To be honest, a fight on the second line (involving stones on the 1 st line!) is not worth fighting. Your moves on the first line have absolutely no value. The last move in particular doesn't do anything - it doesn't attack white, it doesn't take territory, it doesn't build influence....
Related to your earlier strategy to give him the corner in exchange for influence, you should be pleased! He takes 2nd line territory (1 point for each move) whilst you build influence towards the centre. Let him do that, it's not to his advantage.

See var];W[gb];B[hc];W[fa];B[fb];W[eb];B[ea];W[fc];B[gc];W[fa]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fb];W[da];B[fd];W[fa];B[fe]LB[cg:a]C[Joe's comment: This is the end of the fight.  White got the territory and lots of prisoners.  I later won the corner.

(morten)
OK. You have exchanged territory for influence - let's see how you use it :-)

BTW, the upper left corner in the end is dead (your stones, that is)

Your move invites him to push you along and taking 5th line territory - he'll be (very) happy. The one stone you are protecting has no real value. You are better off trying to reduce his enormous corner.  Try something like C13 ('a') instead.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[df];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[dh];B[di]C[(morten)
Hmm. Again, you have exchanged a very large territory for influence - let's see how you use it :-)]
;W[cj];B[qp]C[(morten)
This is very good. The right idea and the right direction. You attack (take away his slide into the corner) and take territory.   Now that your left stone is safe, you can attack his right hand group and drive him towards your wall. Don't count on killing him, but just take territory as you push him along.]
;W[ph]LB[ri:a][rj:b]C[(morten)
This peep is not really dangerous - you are very stong around here, he cannot gain anything by seperating these two stones from eachother.
Since you are strong here, you can afford to be a lot more aggressive - he is the one under attack !
Consider S11 ('a') or S10 ('b').];B[pg];W[oh]C[Joe's comment: From here I started to try to keep the side but ended up ceding a lot of the middle to white.  I didn't get much of the side either.  Should I have tried to keep white on the side, or try to keep the side myself, but with closer attention paid to the white framework developing in the center?

(morten)
It's a question of direction. Taking actual territory in the centre is very difficult - you are usually a lot better off basing your territory on a side and pushing or swelling out from it. Normally, you should chase your opponent towards your thickness, not away from it. In this case, this means that you should be pushing from the bottom, chasing him up to the left, whilst building your lower group.
His 'framework in the centre' is a group struggling to find life! Attack it!]
;B[ri]C[(morten)
Good, but maybe a bit too late.];W[qh];B[rh];W[mh]C[He still has no real base on the side, so you can still chase him.]

(;B[mg]LB[on:a][mf:b]C[(morten)
This is the wrong direction. He doesn't want to go this direction anyway. You are pushing him towards his own safe haven, the lower left.
Consider the difference between this move and a move around P6 ('a'). See variation.

If you wanted to push from this direction, N14 ('b') would normally be better as well. Touching stones you are attacking is not normally a good idea.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[nh];B[mf]LB[lg:a]C[(morten)
Since you are strong around here, you can play at M13 ('a'). If he cuts he's caught in a ladder on both sides.

In general, he is weaker than you are - you should be inviting a fight here.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[lh];W[li];B[lg];W[jg];B[jf];W[hg];B[hf]
;W[if];B[ie];W[ig];B[ke];W[jk];B[jn]C[(morten)
Nice move.];W[km];B[cq]LB[cn:a][mp:b]C[(morten)
You're leaving the door wide open for him to walk straight into your largest potential territory, by not answering his last move. If he plays N4 ('b') you will be left with nothing!

This is a tight invasion. Even though it works, you would probably have been better off just approaching the corner from e.g. C6 ('a') - that would also give you a chance to cut off his centre group to keep at least some sort of pressure on it.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cn];B[bo]LB[co:a]C[(morten)
Strange play by white. Black can just just push up at C5 ('a')?]
;W[co];B[bn];W[bl];B[am]LB[bm:a]C[(morten)
Strange play by white. Why not just push up at B7 ('a')?];W[bm]
;B[ap];W[al];B[an];W[dk];B[fj];W[gi];B[fi]C[Joe's comment:  there are mistakes from this sequence (I end up filling a bamboo joint).  The idea was to try and connect to the stones at the bottom side.  A bridge too far perhaps?

(morten)
The idea of connecting to your lower stones is very good. More than connecting your own stones, you are also separating his. He still has a weak group - although it will live, you can still attack it.

However, when invading at the 3-3- point, you always give the opponent outside influence, which will make it difficult afterwards to cut him apart...]

;W[fk];B[gk];W[ej];B[ei]CR[gk][gl]C[(morten)
Leave him those 2 stones - they are a lot smaller than connecting your stones at G9/8 to the bottom group!]
;W[ek];B[gg]C[(morten)

Why this move? You are already connected there - it is not sente...? Yes, it is one point of territory, but there are bigger moves on the board :-)]
;W[hk];B[im]LB[hm:a]C[(morten)
Better at H7 ('a') to connect up.];W[hl];B[hm]C[(morten)
?];W[gm]LB[mp:a]C[wysi [21k?\]: doh

(morten)
:-)
I am sure you can see that this sequence was hardly optimal for you.
Now, the tables are turned - he has a strong group and it is you who look thin around him. Now is the time to play at e.g.  N4 ('a') to salvage some territory at the bottom]
;B[gn]LB[ql:a][on:b]C[(morten)

This is small. This is not where the points are.  You could still profit from a move at R8 ('a') or P6 ('b'), or the move I suggested just before.]

;W[af]C[(morten)
Contrary to what you said earlier, black is dead. He hasn't got one eye, never mind 2 :-)
His stones at B15 are in atari, and even if he connects at A16 white can take them at A18. Even his eye at A18/19 is false since white can throw in at A18.

Summary:
The black opening was OK, but you made several bad choices related to direction.  In principle it is OK to play for influence, in order to use the influence to create territory - but in practice this must be followed up - you never managed to use the influence you exchanged for territory.
It must also be said that you exchanged a lot of territory for not that much influence. You should be more assertive and not let the opponent do as he pleases. You found yourself in situations where you should have fought harder instead of giving in.
Something else which struck me as important was the sente/gote relations. In some cases, you did not answer a move which really needed answering. Your opponent didn't really take advantage of this, but it is a habit you must try to shake off. I am not saying that you should always respond to your opponents plays, but some times, there are move you must make.
Similarly, you played several moves, especially towards the endgame, which lost you sente. A good endgame can make 20 points difference, and it is worth staying concentrated, although the majority of the game seems to be over :-) (I do this, too)

The biggest errors you made were errors of direction. I get the feeling this is because you don't always realise the strengths/weaknesses of your own, and your opponents groups. When I was your level, I read Davies 'Attack and Defence'. Although much of it is at a high level, I still think it's a very good book for middle/high hyu players - it gives good examples of the use of thickness, forcing moves etc. If your local go club has a copy, I'd suggest you give it a look.  You should also try to sometimes look away from the board, take a deep breath and look at the board 'with fresh eyes'. Getting too much tangled into a fight which is not really of any importance is annoying and should be avoided. Try to see the areas where there are many points to get - and play there first!

Good luck with your game - please get in touch if you have any questions on this review.

Best,

Otherwise you play there and he has no base left at all.];B[io]
LB[qk:a][pk:a][nk:b]C[(morten)
You create a large moyo and he still has to get his group somewhere safe.  Leave him with his worries about living, whilst you profit. In the end, he will probably live with <5 points of territory, but in the meantime, you have constructed a large territory around him.
He also has the cut at the 'a's (Q/R9) to worry about, and you can have some fun by playing moves like O9 ('c')]
