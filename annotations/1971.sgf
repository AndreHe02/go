RE[W+55.5]

C[Hello, I thought for the beginning of the game i was winning, and then i fell apart completely. I would appreciate any help that you can give me. Thank you for your time and effort.

[tartuffe\] Hi, my name is Peter.  I play as tartuffe on KGS where I am rated about 10k.   I will do my best to reveiw your game.  Thanks for using the GTL!

BIG ideas that will GREATLY improve your play:

1) Cover your cutting points.  In this game, most of your problems originated from cutting points.  Look at moves 26, 47, 66, 77, 113, 123, 125, 167 in particular.

2) Try to make territory in this order:  CORNER, SIDE, CENTER.

Why?  It's easy to surround corners (2 sides already blocked), a little tougher to make territory on the side (1 side blocked, and you get support from the corners), and difficult to make territory in the center (very easy to reduce center territory).

During this game you spend much of your time trying to surround the center.  I'll admit, this is an interesting approach, and it *can* work, but you should still understand the CORNER->SIDE->CENTER concept in case your opponent takes measures to prevent you from taking much of the center.  Using this idea will help you find the best move during the opening and will guide your play when you have sente.  Compare how big the center looks at move 63 and the end of the game.  That's how much the center can shrink!  Now look at the corners.  Three of the corners are rock-solid throughout the game.

3)  After the opening each of your moves should do at LEAST one of these things, the more the better: 1) Attack a weak group 2) Defend a weak group 3) Take territory 4) Destroy territory.

Why?  Otherwise you make pointless moves that accomplish nothing.  The above principle will help guide your thinking.  When stronger players review my games they remark on this sometimes... you should be able to say why you made every move.

If you can do these things you will quickly improve.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[pi]C[[tartuffe\] k16, p4 are good moves that are consistent with your center-oriented approach.  I like P4 because it prevents white from getting the whole corner.]
;W[oq]C[[tartuffe\] Solid, but maybe a little slow.];B[jj]C[[tartuffe\] Whoa!  Too early for this point.  Grab points in the CORNER, SIDE, then the CENTER.  See the beginning for an explanation.]
;W[cf];B[ce]C[[tartuffe\] Better at f16, f17, or c12, but this is playable.  This is a VERY common position, and the attachment at c15 is best if you already have a stone at, say, c10 or thereabouts.  If you have a stone there, then c15 takes away white's base and forces white to run into the center.  At your level this is okay, but as you get stronger you will want to shift your thinking a bit.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[bg]
(;B[ae];W[bf]
(;B[fj]C[[tartuffe\] D14 is the urgent point here.  F10 does not do anything.]

(;W[cj]
(;B[dg]C[[tartuffe\] Whoops!  This MUST be d14 to cover your weak points!]
;W[de];B[cd];W[df]
(;B[jm]C[[tartuffe\] Whoops!  This MUST be in the upper left corner.]
;W[jp];B[fp];W[fe]C[[tartuffe\] Big.]
(;B[fd]C[[tartuffe\] F17 is probably safer, since the e16 cut is dangerous for you (as you can see).  The variation shows what happens if you play F17 and white tries to cut.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[ee];B[fg]C[[Tartuffe\] CORNER SIDE CENTER.  You aren't going to make much territory with this move.  Defending F16 will help you get MUCH more territory.]

(;W[ge];B[do]C[[tartuffe\] It might be dangerous to leave the upper side right now... if you lose sente here white WILL do serious damage to the upper side and probably make territory there.]

;W[bm]
(;B[fr];W[er];B[gs]C[[tartuffe\] Very small.  Take the opportunity to play somewhere else!  Would you rather save the f2 stone or save your territory in the upper left?]
;W[cl]
(;B[he]C[[tartuffe\] Good idea, but this is in the wrong place.  Try G17?]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[hd]
(;B[je]C[[Tartuffe\] Saving your H15 stone isn't very important, since it isn't doing anything.  Here you could play one of many big moves.  The one that jumps out at me is Q6.]
;W[jd];B[kd];W[jc];B[lc];W[kc];B[le];W[ie]C[[tartuffe\] Slow move by white, probably the weakest move so far by white.]
;B[oo];W[hf]C[[tartuffe\] Not needed.]
(;B[ol]C[[Tartuffe\] You were very wise not to respond to white's last couple moves.  However, why not play p8 at r6?  You get more territory, and you reduce what white could possibly claim.]
;W[mq];B[ig];W[hg]
(;B[hh]C[[tartuffe\] You defend the wrong side here.  Defend the other side and you have a winning game, if you can help your stones on the left side. :-)]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[if]
(;B[jg]C[[tartuffe\] letting white get much farther into your moyo is very dangerous!]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[gh]
(;B[hi];W[lf];B[mf]C[What was the correct move here? I knew I had to stop black, but i failed.

[tartuffe\] You have too many cutting points (N15, N13, M12) to defend right now.  You WILL lose some stones, so try to cut your losses.  Give white a few points and try to defend your territory.]
;W[mg]C[should I have abandoned the stone at m13?  do you think I could have saved the group?

[tartuffe\]  You have to decide which group lives and which group dies.]

(;B[lh]C[[tartuffe\] You chose to save the center and sacrifice the upper side.]
;W[me]
(;B[ld]C[[tartuffe\] Save your territory, not 4 stones!];W[nf]
C[[tartuffe\] This is the real disaster.  Most of your territory goes *poof*, and saving your six stones is a Phyrric victory.  Check out the variations.]

(;B[md]C[[tartuffe\] This move works, but it is bad shape.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[od]
(;B[oe];W[of];B[pe];W[oc];B[ne];W[mf]
(;B[pb]C[[tartuffe\] This was your last chance to save the group.  P18 starts a ladder.]
;W[nb]C[[tartuffe\] Black dies.];B[ob]C[At this point I thought the group was dead so i tried to protect my corner

[tartuffe\] Great idea!];W[mc];B[pc];W[lb];B[gb];W[hb];B[pg]
;W[mh];B[ji];W[mi];B[mj];W[ni];B[oj]C[At this point i knew i had to make territory in the center and prevent white from connecting, but i could not

[tartuffe\] Look at where you are now making territory:  On the right side! Let white snake his way through the middle and connect, if he wants.  He makes no territory, and you get HUGE profits!

Quick score check:
Black:
Upper left corner: About 15 points, potential for 0 more.
Right corner/side:  About 30 points, potential for 15 more.
Right-Upper-Middle: About 5 points, potential for 10 more.
Left-Lower-Middle: About 2 points, potential for 10 more.
Total:  52-87 points.
Black should grab the whole right side with r6 ASAP!

White:
Upper side: About 15 points, potential for 0 more.
Lower side:  About 20 points, potential for 15 more.
Lower Left Corner, Left side: About 30 points, potential for 10 more.
Total (plus captures): 75-100.
White should play r6 ASAP!

Black still has a chance to win this game!  Find the contested areas.]
;W[nj]C[[tartuffe\] White misses the point, too.  R6 would be huge!  F12 captures many points, but is not as good.]

(;B[mk];W[nk];B[qo]C[[Tartuffe\] Great idea!];W[rp]
(;B[mm]C[[tartuffe\] Here you slip a little.  P9 is good and solid.]
;W[nl];B[nm];W[ml];B[ll]C[[tartuffe\] Blocking the wrong side.  P9 makes your wall very solid.]

;W[pf];B[qf];W[oi]

;W[sl]C[I thought that sacrificing those 2 stones would help me fortify my side territory

[tartuffe\] after the s6 mistake, this is probably your best bet.  Good recovery!  Now the game looks difficult to win, though.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[pl];B[lo]C[[tartuffe\] Good, the Q9 cut isn't *that* big, so you can ignore it.  White gains nothing by connecting two live groups.]

[tartuffe\] You played an unusual style aggressively, so kudos for that.  Your instincts were often right on, but tactical mistakes caused a few disasters.  Many of your problems came from having too many cutting points.  Your game will reach the next level once you begin to apply the concepts I put at the beginning.  I hope this review helps, I had fun doing it. :-)  If you see me on IGS or KGS feel free to ask for a game.  Good luck with your future games!]
