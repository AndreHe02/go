;B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq]C[Let's look at the board here: if it were'nt by D6 and R14 it would be
simetric, nevertheless upper and lower sides are, and not only it means  it's kind of miai, groups there are stable and on the 3rd line, so, to
overstate it, the position is played out.
then right and left remains. At the right side R14 and R8 are low, so again it
looks like played out ... unles black wants to try some cosmic variation (see it)
So, only the left side remains, and C8 (or C9) threatening B6 looks interesting.]

(;B[lq]C[B37. OK? If not, where better?

B37 looks like a big (about12 points?) yose move disputing the points
from K to N. It's not yose time now.];W[mq];B[qi]C[B39. Same question.

(Almost) same asnwer, plus: the N3 stone is a very good (even if it could
look slow) move by it's own, it strengthens a lot white's corner, the M3 stone,
as it stands now, does almost nothing ... unless it's followed up by M4. That
would be better than R11, which is anyway too low: usually one tries to keep
balance between 3rd and 4th line.];W[dk]C[It looks (over simplification?) that white is making 4 more points at the left
than black at the right, plus the M-N 3 echange at the lower side is better
for white if it's not followed up, and that would mean giving the initiative
to white, who could, for example, play simetrically at the top.]
;B[ck]C[B41. Same question.

But difficult to answer now!  Sente at this stage is all important, and it's easy for white to grab it now, letting
black whith a weak group there that later will prove a burden, reduce the rigth
side lightly in sente and then attack the lower side. In theory. I still prefer M4,
that would also help in attacking any reducing move to the right.]
;W[dl];B[dj]C[B43. Same question.

D10 looks like the natural move to me, perhaps playing first D14 to see what
white does is interesting, trying to tangle things to either keep sente or beeing
able to settle the black stones in the left.];W[ej];B[di];W[dg]
;B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[bi];B[bj];W[ci];B[cj];W[eq];B[er];W[hq]
C[Very good move, white has reinforced the upper left stones in sente, levaing
a weak black group and forgetting about the side points uses sente to attack  the lower side.]
;B[fp]C[If you are worried about white shifting the side territory by a center one
then C10, or even B10, should have been played at G10. this is the key point
to get power in the center. I think that now H4 (or H3, but looks too submissive.)
trying to link all black stones, is better.];W[gr];B[fr];W[ir]
;B[hp];W[jq];B[ip];W[jp];B[gm]C[B65. Was this sequence OK for B?? If not, what would have been better?

White will play at G9, if it was an important point before, now that black's
lower group is still unsettled all the more. White has been deprived of points
at the left, but the ones that will make at the lower side *plus* the ones lost
there *plus* having weak groups to torture make for that.];W[gj]
;B[fg];W[fd];B[gc];W[df];B[ih];W[cr]C[Chasing black to the center feels good here.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[lp]C[White proceeds as expected, but M4 could be at N5, going to reduce blacks
prospects on the right.];B[pn];W[ij]C[Maybe M7 instead of J10 would be better for white.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[km];W[cl]C[After C2 white is quite safe, C8 is not as big as it looks.
Reducing on the right (M7, L10, P11 or even Q7 to test blacks reaction
come to mind) and trying to keep sente to play C8 or B7 later seems
better.];B[bl];W[bm];B[am];W[bn];B[kj]C[B87. At this point I though that I had a winning position. Was I right? If not why?   It's the kind of position I prefer myself too, but lets count:
White: LL 10 pts. LR 24 pts UL 7 pts. UR 7 pts. = 48 points + sente
Black: UL 12 pts. L 2 pts. CL 2 pts. RS 26 pts     = 42 points  + center project - 2 weak grps.

(for this conservative way of counting, take a look at Cho Chikun's book
High Speed Game Analysis)];W[mn];B[nm];W[ne]C[White is reducing very conservatively, N10 or Q7 before O15 and N6
to test black reaction could be more damaging ... and risky.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[ji]C[First move taken advantage of a weak group, of course if black can play now
M12 and survive it would be a won game.];B[if];W[he];B[hf];W[ic]
C[L11, or something reducing the center looks better, in fact even R18 is
bigger than J17.];B[mg]C[When closing is better to reinforce the weaker part: I think M12 is best, but
N8 would be safer.];W[ki];B[mi];W[lj]C[Again a move taking advantage of a weak group, N10, closing the right side
bye 8th line would be nice, but, if white plays then M8, cutting the black
group, can it survive?
 It's a difficult fight, I think black dies, but then losing by 6 or by 60 ....]

(;B[mm];W[mj];B[oj]C[B105. I thought that I was ahead, so I played conservatively. Was this correct?

From my previous count white 4 more points at the upper side with J17, while denying
to black the same move for the same points, so 8 points difference,  and has sente
to play at R18, B:S18 W:S19 B:T18 W N15 thus about 3 more points there,  while black  has gained about 10 points in the center. But H18 is also sente so I think white is
still ahead and blacks center growth has been compensated bye white's moves.

Besides, why not O10 instead of P10 ?];W[kg]C[Looks like a dame point ...]
;B[ak]C[... that loses the sequence W:A6 B:A8 W:A10 B:B9 and white takes away 2 points from
black. Black thankfully takes out one of his own points with A9 instead of A10 :-)]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[il]C[Small compared with R18 or H18 or other sente moves as T5.]
;B[im]C[Same.];W[fn];B[gn];W[an];B[al];W[ai];B[aj];W[lf]C[Big gote, but not big enough.]
;B[gi]C[B119. Once again I thought that I was ahead and therefore played very conservatively. Evidently, I was mistaken but I still don't see it, so please explain.

It's a matter of counting points, the right side looks bigger than it actually is, you
have to imagine the boundary with all the black stones added to protect from
white's attempts to enter and count the remaining vacant points.
OTOH, if white gets to play J15, white's upper group becomes surprisingly big.]
;W[so];B[sn];W[sp];B[rn];W[nj];B[ok]C[Instead of P9  O11 seems bigger. If White then plays P9 black can cut at O9.]
;W[ni];B[oi];W[nh];B[oh];W[je];B[ie];W[id]C[Not as big as it looks, R18 is much bigger.]
;B[qb];W[hb];B[gb];W[oc];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[bq];B[oq];W[or]
;B[pc];W[nn]C[Not as big as it looks, connecting at P18 is bigger.]
;B[ln];W[ll];B[lm]C[B147. Same.

Because of white's continuous sente moves against weak groups, there
will appear points for him everywhere (killing L10 or N11, e.i.) This points
are unnoticed till the end, but they add to the total.];W[lo]
;B[ob]C[Now the game is close again.];W[nb];B[pa];W[fo];B[go]
;W[fm];B[gq];W[hr];B[ae];W[af];B[jf]C[B1159. In retrospect this seems too slow, but played for the same reason.

Looks like a good sente move to me, there's no much more left now.
The game is very close, white a little ahead maybe.

Of course this sequences are just a possibility.]))
