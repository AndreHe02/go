hello, it is a game i played on the internet with another player.
i played white in this game
i think i made quite a few mistakes in this game, like not defending my territory properly.
please feel free to point out other mistakes.
thank you very much

----------
Hi, freeBIRD:

I'm SirBowen on KGS (~11k). I'll preface my comments throughout the game with <SB>.

The main thing I hope to do in reviews is to use the game to point out general principles, rather than make too many "you should have played this stone at X" comments. I hope they're helpful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[jp];B[jc];W[dj];B[cf]C[<SB>
Play up to here has been pretty straightforward.

This play by Black, however, puts a stone in a "pre-pincered" position - not a usual move.]
;W[fd];B[ef];W[hd];B[gf];W[ib]C[freeBIRD:
should i connect my top left stones with the bottom left ones? i chose to defend

----------
<SB>
Your upper-left group was not in any trouble - even before you made this move.

There's plenty of space in the corner, and along the top edge, for eyes/territory - and there's still access to the center. If Black started to attack one of these 3 spots, you just gain safety in the other two.

Oddly enough, it's Black's group (around the E14 stone) that's floating and somewhat weak - because Black put himself in a weak initial position starting at C14.

It's not that you can kill the group - it also has ways out. But you can chase it around while it tries to make a secure base or connect to another group, during which time you can gain some advantage. Of course, this should probably be AFTER you make some more opening-type moves to sketch out a larger moyo or interrupt his moyo-building.]
;B[jd];W[nq];B[jb]C[<SB>
With this move in the upper-center, Black is getting way more strength than you, right up next to your J18 stone. This should send up a warning flag that it's becoming urgent to reinforce your position in the area.

As I said, this stone wasn't critical to play in the first place. But we'll ingore that for a moment.

As a general rule, if it's worth playing then it's worth spending the moves to defend it when the need arises. After all, making big plays doesn't buy you very much if they just get taken back later for lack of defense.

So here's a general rule - urgent moves take precedence over big moves. And an urgent move usually protects something you've already gained.

That's not to say that you have to protect every stone on the board. Sometimes for tactical reasons you'll sacrifice stones. And, besides, sometimes we just make a mistake, and many games have been lost by protecting a previous mistake that we should have just abandoned.

But at this point you weren't considering the J18 stone to be either one of these cases. Not protecting it now is what cost you later.]
;W[pq]C[<SB>
Here's another principle... touching an enemy stone is reserved for when you're defending a weak position. Don't use it for attacking or invading.

(This refers to this stage of the game when you jump into contact with the opponent - later on, of course, as the board fills up you'll end up bumping into one another for a variety of reasons.)]
;B[di]C[Here Black does the same thing - but he's actually using it in somewhat the right way (the timing is wrong, but we'll ignore that for now).

By making this contact play, he's gaining space for his floating group that I mentioned before. Now he has some depth to the group that can turn into eye space or territory.]
;W[ej];B[op]C[<SB>
Well, he needs to follow up on the effort he started in the middle left...

But this brings us back to illustrating the problem with jumping into contact with his stones. When you contact his stones, he gets the next play. And if he reinforces the stone you touched, like he just did here, then he suddenly has a numerical advantage in that area...

Now his group at Q4 has 5 liberties, while he's touching two of your stones - one has 3 liberties and one has 4 liberties, so they're weaker.

If we move forward a few plays...];W[mp];B[np];W[no];B[oq];W[or]
C[freeBIRD:
i made quite a few mistakes in the fighting of lower right corner. is playing at q3 and p2 bad decisions?

----------
<SB>
...we can connect your feeling of making mistakes at this point to the existing weakness of your groups. His one solidly-connected group here is directly touching 5 of your weak stones, each of which can easily be cut from the others. Two of your stones have only 2 liberties, making them easy targets for atari.

So Black is now able to cut up your position. While you're saving one of your stones for atari, Black is setting up an attack on the next. Everything that follows in this corner is just a result of having so many individual, cuttable stones around.

So, next principle: keep your stones connected. It may seem like you're being too conservative and giving him too much advantage. But it's better to do that, and to gain back advantages later from a position of strength.]

;B[qs];W[os];B[nr];W[mr];B[ns];W[qo];B[mq];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr]
;B[ms];W[ks];B[lp];W[kq];B[mo];W[gp]C[<SB>
At the point where you end up with a solidly-connected group in the lower-middle, the carnage stops.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[ao];W[an]
;B[ap];W[dr];B[er];W[fr];B[cr];W[es];B[ep];W[fp];B[do];W[co]
;B[eo]C[<SB>
From this point until almost the end of the game, Black's position in the lower-left corner is unsettled (meaning that whoever plays there next wins). You could have killed it with one play there - he could have secured it with one play there.

In order to see this sort of thing, I recommend spending time doing life-and-death problems. They improve your game a lot.

Personally, I've liked the "Graded Go Problems for Beginners" series of books. But there are plenty of others to choose from.]
;W[fn];B[nn];W[en];B[ic];W[hb];B[hc];W[gc];B[ge];W[gd];B[bd]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[bi]C[freeBIRD:
am i too conservative here? i was trying to attack the c14 black group.

----------
<SB>
In making this decision, the main thing you should have in mind is WHY are you attacking the group.

Most beginners think in terms of attacking to kill. This almost never works - there are simply too many ways for them to live. Only attack to kill if you can actually read out a sequence that kills the opposing group. Otherwise, you'll generally fail and, in the process, hurt your own positions.

(Of course, you might attack to kill as a desperation move if you're going to lose the game and have no other options - a sort of "Hail Mary" play hoping that something turns up. That's not the case here, though.)

Otherwise you can attack to reduce his territory, or attack to gain influence, or attack to push him back enough get get eye space, whatever.

That said, this move undercuts some space that he could claim as territory if he got the next move here. A reasonable choice, though I might have preferred to come from the outside since this is the only of your groups that is going to have reasonable access to the center.]
;B[ei];W[cj];B[ch];W[bh];B[bg];W[kn];B[ci];W[aj];B[ah];W[gj]
;B[he];W[ij]C[freeBIRD
i was trying to reach the center

----------
<SB>
A noble goal. But really with the G10 play you had kept your access to the center.

More important right now is that you have pretty much nothing on the right half of the board, whereas Black has significant footholds on the left half. This is a sign that it's time for you to invade, and there are still plenty of places on the right half to do so.

To be honest, if Black had just played conservatively from this point and solidified his positions, he would have won handily.]
;B[qf]C[<SB>
And, for a bit, it appears that he's going to do just that...]
;W[lo];B[oo];W[kp];B[ln]C[<SB>
In this exchange, both you and Black get too focused on capturing/saving single stones. Since you both do it, it really doesn't affect the outcome much. But you should have been taking this chance to invade, Black should have been shoring up his positions.

So, another principle: Don't worry about single stones or small groups until the very end-game (unless, of course, they are strategically important, such as cutting stones).]

;W[il]C[freeBIRD:
should i play j7 instead of j8? i was worrying black might have the advantage of attacking, but black didn't attack

--------
<SB>
Yes, J7 would have been better. This goes back to the previous discussion about keeping secure connections. You were fortunate that Black didn't see the cutting point at J7 until later, when you had already had a chance to reinforce the position.]
;B[lp];W[jk];B[kl];W[mp];B[im];W[jn];B[hm];W[fo]C[freeBIRD:
i was trying to stop the connection of h7, j7 to the lower black

---------
<SB>
There's not much danger in this particular case, but it's good that you can see the potential for this sort of thing.]
;B[hl];W[ik];B[lp];W[kj];B[lj];W[li];B[mj];W[mi]LB[ki:A]C[<SB>
Once again, the bend at M11 was somewhat over-aggressive on your part, leaving a cutting point at A. Fortunately Black didn't see it until it was too late; if he had played there you would have been hurting.

Again, watch those connections.];B[lk];W[ni];B[jh];W[lg];B[hh]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[gi];W[ji]C[<SB>
This is a key turning point. Your cutting point at A is finally protected, giving you a projection into his upper-right area. Any time up until now he could have cut it off.]
;B[kh];W[ki];B[nj];W[pi];B[lh];W[mh]LB[mg:A]C[<SB>
Now there's another cutting point in your position, at A. Again, Black never saw it, and by missing it he allowed you to take even more space.

Watch Those Connections!];B[pj];W[pf];B[nf];W[qg];B[pe];W[rf]
;B[qe];W[og];B[pg];W[ph];B[of];W[pg];B[re];W[se]C[freeBIRD:
i was immediately regret when i placed this stone

----------
<SB>
This is a pattern you'll just learn to avoid through experience.]
;B[rg];W[sf];B[sg];W[rh];B[sd];W[mf]C[<SB>
Now you've covered that cutting point, and gained access to the upper-central area. Black could have prevented this up until this move.]
;B[ri];W[ne];B[oe];W[md];B[nd];W[me];B[ng];W[mg];B[nc];W[ke]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[mc];W[ja]C[<SB>
This is the move that causes your later loss in this area. It's very similar to the pattern that started at T15. Again, you'll just learn to see this kind of thing coming.]

;B[ee];W[ed];B[ld];W[le];B[ig];W[ac];B[kg];W[kf];B[sh];W[qh]
;B[qi];W[oi];B[oj];W[qp]C[freeBIRD:
i decided to attack the lower right black territory
was it a wrong decision?

----------
<SB>
Well, I can't say it's right, since it should have been a futile effort on your part. Black's play here was way off-target. With even marginally better play, he should have been able to kill your group.

However, I can't say it's "wrong" either, because you need to do something at this point.

Even with all of the mistakes that Black made in letting you encroach into the upper-right area, he's still way ahead at this time (~35 points).

(One thing to notice - though your encroachment in the upper right chewed up a chunk of his territory, it didn't actually make any territory for you. That's the nature of this type of "snake".)

So, it doesn't cost you anything to try, and you may just pull a rabbit out of your hat.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[so];B[ss]C[freeBIRD:
i was expecting black would  block my extension of my tiny s5 white group

----------
<SB>
Yes, that would have been fatal for you. Just one of Black's many mistakes here.]

;W[pk];B[om];W[ol];B[ok];W[pm];B[qk];W[sp];B[pl];W[rq]C[freeBIRD:
i guess i was lucky that black didn't attack my stones while making two eyes to survive

----------
<SB>
Yes, and I think that your being able to make this observation is precisely why you made life here. I don't think that Black knew what he was trying to prevent, while you knew what you were trying to achieve (namely, eye space). He seemed to go back to picking off single stones here and there.]
;B[nl];W[sr];B[rk];W[rs];B[sl];W[qr];B[pq];W[ps];B[os];W[qs]
C[<SB>
So there's your rabbit. Nicely done.];B[rn]C[<SB>
Yow. This game is close now.

Black totally wasted a move here. I don't even know what he thought this would do.

If, instead, Black had taken this move to secure the lower-left corner, he probably would have STILL won by a couple of points.]
;W[cs]C[freeBIRD:
the lower left black group is weak, so i decided to attack

---------
<SB>
Now that you played here first, it's not just weak, it's officially dead. He can't make two eyes here unless you completely mess up.

So this is really where you won the game.];B[nh];W[bs];B[ag]

i am not sure if this move is necessary to destroy the black group, but i placed the stone there anyway

---------
<SB>
As mentioned, the corner was dead with C1. You didn't need B1 or this move. Again, life-and-death study helps a lot.]
;B[gb]C[freeBIRD:
i didn't see the weakness of my white group until the black placed the stone there...
my questions ends here
thanks for your time reading

----------
<SB>
You're most welcome.

I hope the comments help, and I hope that you enjoy playing this wonderful game!]
