C[A game from a local tourament.
Time 1 hour + 10moves/5mins

Kerem2d (W)- Sercan1d(B)

I was Black

Result: W+Resign


I wonder the first 65 moves of the game mostly.
After 60-70 moves game becomes much more complex.
So i couldn't put the moves in this SGF.

Big fights begin in 20 moves and in the end E13 group dies.


During the game W tried to take everywhere and had.
Black couldnt punish any risky move.
