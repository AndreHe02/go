C[J: Hi!

I think you can improve easily in the following ways:

- before placing a stone, make sure it's really necessary: there are a lot of stones placed "automatically" (by both sides), thus losing the initiative.
- beware of cuts!
- don't be confident on center territory: this game is a very good example on how it uses to shrink.
- stop from time to time (best after finishing a local battle) to consider the global situation: if you need to invade, do it. Timid invasions often lead to "unexpected" results.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[jd];B[pj];W[dj];B[fe]C[j: This move is a little bit extrange...]
;W[df]C[j: I understand you have decided to fortify your left side leaving open the top]
;B[fc];W[ph]C[j: Too wide (leaves Q14 as easy invasion) Why not Q13, or R14?]
;B[pf];W[md];B[qh];W[nh];B[id];W[ic];B[hc];W[jc];B[ie];W[je]
;B[nf];W[lh];B[dm];W[fl]C[j: This move I don't understand: What are you trying to accomplish? You'll find hard making points on the center (mostly with the J15 group), and this move invites black F6, making him stronger]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[ef];W[eh];B[de];W[ce];B[ee];W[cd];B[ed];W[pl]
C[J: I think it's time to enter deeper, to avoid him making a big moyo down.]
;B[qk];W[ql];B[pn];W[nl];B[oj];W[mj];B[oh];W[og];B[oi];W[of]
;B[ng];W[oe];B[mh];W[mg]C[j: No, better O11, splitting him]
;B[ni];W[pg];B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[qe];B[mi];W[jh]C[j: I think you're too much worried about those stones. Why not let them stand and invade/reduce the lower side of the board? (F4 or similar)]
;B[lg];W[mf];B[kg];W[kh];B[jg];W[ig];B[if];W[ih];B[jf];W[lf]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[me];W[le];B[kf];W[ld];B[ne];W[nd];B[nh]C[j: Let's examine the board now:

- you have territory on the upper right (big!) and left side.
- he has only a few points of secure terr. on the right side, and a moyo-to-be down
- you have a unsettled group in the middle, but nothing to worry about, I'd say, as you can link it to the left or make life easily.
- you cannot kill any of his groups

So... why not a big invasion down? If this zone becomes black's territory, you'll have a big problem.]
;W[od]C[j: No need for that!];B[qi];W[qn]C[j: with this "humble" invasion, you're helping him to fortify... let's see]
;B[qo];W[pm];B[rn];W[qm];B[rl];W[pk];B[rj];W[rm];B[rp]C[j: see? Now, he is stronger, and you have accomplished nothing...]
;W[on];B[po]C[j: Now it's the time to O4!];W[sn];B[ro];W[sm]
C[j: Why? Try to avoid this "automatic" moves; always check if a move is really necessary or not!]
;B[sl];W[no]C[j: Ok, good direction, but too timid];B[oo];W[nn]
;B[np];W[lo]C[j: why not N4?];B[lp]C[j: See? He is securing his bottom side!]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[mo];B[kp];W[ko]C[j: the zone you're delimiting on the center seems big, but let's see how it finish. It's very difficult to obtain points in the center]
;B[jo];W[cm]C[j: again, too timid. I'd hit on F or G 4];B[cn]
;W[cl];B[fh];W[dh]C[j: Why not E11???];B[fi];W[fj]C[
 broxie 29k*: sorry, net problems];B[ej];W[ei];B[ek];W[el];B[fk]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[hj];B[gl];W[dl];B[em];W[dk]C[j: No! Now he must close the bottom-left (F7)]
;B[fm]C[j: Of course. I think you're done (almost) already]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[il];B[im];W[jl];B[jm];W[jj];B[kl];W[km];B[kn]
;W[ln]C[j: I understand this is a mistake... M7!];B[lm]C[j: your center territory vanishes! :-(]
;W[ll];B[mm];W[nm];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[lj];B[kk];W[jk];B[nk]
C[j: now, you're really done. I think you made a few mistakes here. You should never let him cut you, unless both groups are absolutely safe]

;W[ja];B[gb];W[pi];B[qj];W[li];B[cq]C[j: Ok, even it was a possibility for a 3-3 invasion. But no more...]
;W[bn];B[bo]C[J: see var on your next move... (more aggresive)]

(;W[bm];B[ao];W[an]C[j: again, no need, just 1 point move... ok, maybe not too many bigger ones around...]
;B[do];W[so];B[sp];W[pe]C[j: you don't need to take this stone; better left as it is (one point more)]
