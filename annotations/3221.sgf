AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer, I played this game as white in a go club during simul game with Alexandre Dinerchtein 1p. The game was played rather quickly because of time constrains so there can be tactial errors I would not make in normal game. Still the game was interesting for me to get reviewed.

csh: Looking at your comments in the game, I assumed you played Black. I will try my best to help.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[ci];B[bp]LB[jd:A]C[Not sure if this is good move - perhaps it was better to play elsewhere.

csh: It's a solid move - it protects the corner, and threatens the white group with an invasion later. However, there are bigger moves on the board. Since the lower left is already somewhat secure, you can also play big moves that would make a large moyo (framework.) Something like 'A' comes to mind, but then you'd have to be able to handle the subsequent invasion by White later on.]
;W[pm];B[np];W[qf];B[pj]TR[qf]C[I'm trying to play actively :) In retrospect I think I would prefer this stone at Q11.

csh: I think this is the right idea, since it's trying to keep the white stones from becoming a single group.  I don't know if Q11 would be any better, particularly. The white stone in the upper right can always invade the 3-3 point, so both this move and Q11 don't put a lot of pressure on the marked white stone.

Finally, the one thing that this pincer sacrifices is the stability of the black stone in the upper right. White may get another move to attack the upper right.]
;W[md]C[I didn't have a good plan how to respond here.

csh: When in doubt, fight to get out to the middle. It's better because 1) you can connect to something and save your corner, and 2) it keeps his stones separated.]
;B[pf]C[csh: Right idea.];W[pg];B[qg]C[I'm cutting expecting support from Q10 stones. If the stone was at Q11 this would work better I guess.

csh: I don't think this is the right choice here. I show a joseki, and why the result isn't optimal. I think merely getting out and keeping his stones separated is a better result.]
;W[re]
(;B[qd]C[csh: This was the problem move. See the variation.]
;W[of];B[pe];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[og];W[ph];B[rd]C[Too slow? Was it better to play O14?

csh: Yes, this move is too slow, but this move wasn't the problem. R16 was the problem move.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[oi];W[qk]TR[pg][ph][qh][rh][pm]SQ[md][mf]
[nf][of]C[csh: The white triangle group seems stable. The white square group doesn't have a base, but it has room to make one. In contrast, the black group is floating, and the corner is sealed off from the center. This isn't a good result.]
;B[rf]C[csh: This is an endgame move. Your corner can live without it.]
;W[pk];B[cg]TR[md][mf][nf][of][ng][og][oi][pj]C[I decided to tenuki as I didn't see any good idea how to develop marked stones.

csh: I don't think the "development" of the stones is the main issue. If your stones are captured on a large scale, I think you are in trouble. While you don't have to save them all, I think that pushing in from the outside, and threatening to save those stones can significantly reduce White's territory.

It is always good to consider playing tenuki, but I don't know that I would do it here. If your stones run to the center, then the triangle white stones can be pressured. If the triangle black stones are captured, the triangle white stones become much stronger, and White has little to worry about when expanding across the top of the board.]
;W[dk];B[jc]C[Perhaps it was better to play this stone closer to the top left corner.

csh: It's hard to say, as the 3-3 is still open. White won't invade now, but look to reduce first, to make your wall (after  the white 3-3 invasion) worth less than if he invaded directly.]
;W[je]C[csh: So here's the reduction. Note how it also helps strengthen the N14 group.]
;B[hd];W[cc]C[csh: And then the invasion.];B[dc]C[I was not sure which side to block.

csh: This is the right side. It has more potential than the extension down the lefthand side of the board.]
;W[cd];B[cb]C[csh: I was debating about the joseki choice, but I think you made the right decision.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[de];B[ee];W[ce];B[dg];W[bb];B[db];W[bg];B[bh]
;W[af];B[ch];W[lh];B[ba]C[csh: I'm surprised you tenukied. Your move is sente, so I guess you can see how he answers.]
;W[ab];B[ad];W[bd];B[ah];W[bf];B[cm]TR[ng][og][oi][pj]C[Again I'm trying to play actively and attack white stones on the left side. Was it better to run with marked group?

csh: I think at least trying to get your stones out will help. Even if you sacrifice the four stones, the moves you play int the area of O8 or so will still check the growth of his territory on the right.

Also, note that C8 might be a better attacking move. It can connect under to either side, and it still robs the white group of its base. The problem with this move is that it "forces" White to connect his stones.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[lj];B[fm]C[csh: Okay idea, but it's hard to keep them from connecting to the M10 group.]
;W[gk];B[hl]C[csh: Black is too thin in the center to really pressure White.]
;W[gh];B[fg];W[ih];B[fj];W[fk];B[nk]TR[ng][og][oi][pj]C[Dump mistake - I wanted to sacrifice marked stones and try to build moyo on the bottom side. Of course it didn't work out :(

csh: I think it's a little close now, with M12 and M10 played. It's the right idea, though, but probably a little late.]

;B[jn];W[ln]C[Nice splitting attack.];B[io]TR[ll][nm][pm][ln]
C[I missed the fact that white can capture my group now.

csh: This shape is actually one to remember, because of the tesuji White plays.]
;W[nn];B[mm]C[csh: Just FYI, but it doesn't work if you hane, either. White will cut at O8.]

C[Here starts the yose. I don't play yose well as usually my games rarely get to the yose stage (there is usully a resign much ealier :). By my estimates I was still having an advantage at this stage. Any advices on my major mistakes in the yose?

csh: Yose is when the territories are pretty well determined. I hesitate to call this yose, because I feel that the life or death of the lower right is not yet determined. (Well, more so before you moved.)

Do you count or estimate territory? I estimate about 40 points on the right for White (with the capture) and five in the upper left. I don't know what I'd guess for White towards the top.

I estimate about 40 points for the top for you. You probably won't get much on the left, but the lower side is pretty big.

Seems like it depends on the status of the group in the lower right, to me.]
;W[lr]C[csh: I would be tempted to play along the right, and give up the N2 stone if he goes after it.]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[qn];W[pn];B[qo]C[csh: Seems like a decent result. There's a big point at the bottom of the board to close the open skirt, and the top is big, too.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[oc];B[rl];W[rk];B[ql];W[pl];B[gj]C[csh: I think the upper right might be worth more. But this is sente.]

[pj]C[csh: The end result gives White a wall, and leaves your marked stone  in trouble. You also get a wall out of it, but since you don't have an extension across the top of the board, you aren't getting as much out of it. White's marked stone isn't in as much trouble since it has room to make an extension. 

The problem started with the crosscut. It's a good choice sometimes, but in this case, it hurts the Q10 stone.]
