Black: Deepak (3 stone handicap)

White: MFGO (level 1 at 30 seconds)

Your biggest mistakes happen in the middle and endgame. I don't know if this helps you, but they seem to have to do with cutting and connection. In each case you misread how much a cut or connection is going to help or hinder you or your opponent. You need to look for cutting points and analyze them in terms of whether or not the groups of each color on both sides of the cut can survive or not. That is up to 4 groups, 2 of each color. This analysis tells you if the cut is even important for either side. If all 4 groups live, it is not. However, if a cut is going to leave a chain of your stones eyeless as it does on the left, you need to connect. On the right, you could hane because the hane stone could run even after it had been cut, and you had a good chance to kill the enemy edge group if it didn't get too big. At the bottom, you had multiple chances to cut off an invading group. You didn't, probably because you were afraid that one of your groups was weak, but the invading group was even weaker.

Good luck on your future play! I hope this helps.];W[ep];B[np]

(;B[mc]C[Black should have been more aggressive here ... in retrospect,
I should have attached at m16 and battled to kill white here

I don't know. Both moves have their merits. You are strong here, but not so strong that w is not going to be able to get something out of his invasion, either a small life on the side, an escape to the center, or thickness in the center. You have the opportunity to harass w's weak stone and get something for yourself at the same time. The game move tends to chase w into center where you will probably be able to harass him some more. You are strengthening the corner, but it is not secure yet. See alternate for one way to play the move you suggest. I am not saying that this line is best for either w or b. There are a lot of possiblities here.

So far, your moves are at least reasonable.];W[ld];B[qm]LB[hc:A]
[pj:B]TR[np][pp]MA[qf]C[This is the move to criticize, not your last one.

When reviewing your own games take advantage of hindsight. The go proverb that applies here is (something like): "Your enemies key point is your own." If you had played A, w would not really know how to best use his 2 stones and you would secure real territory in the upper left. When playing with handicap you should seek to put pressure on w's weak stones and use that pressure as a handle to turn the game in your favor. Actually to keep the game in your favor since the handicap makes it in your favor to begin with. Your should know that w in turn is seeking to create confusion, so that his superior analysis will win. You want to look for moves that keep w's stone's weak while creating big frameworks or consolidating your territory.

The game move has some merit as a claim for either territory in the corner or central influence, but it does not put any pressure on any of w's stones and is really a narrow extension from the triangle enclosure. An ideal extension would be B and this would also put some pressure on the square w stone. B in conjunction with the triangles creates a big framework. You probably won't get all of this as territory but its potential size forces w to consider how to reduce it and, in turn, limits his options.

A is probably the urgent point here and B is a big point to hope to play.]
;W[hc]C[Good move by white to surround this black stone

It's not so much that the b stone is really dead as that w is able to create confusion as I said earlier. The fact that w is able to make you "feel" surrounded is part of this confusion.]

(;B[hd]LB[id:A][gc:B]C[I am not sure what is best here, but A or B deserve some consideration. See alternates.]
;W[lf];B[ic];W[nf];B[oe]LB[rd:A][qd:B][qc:C][qi:D]C[This move is small and slow I think. It does sort of protect a weakness in b's position, but A-C would be bigger for that position. It does sort of threaten to cut through w's loose postion, but a move like D would put some pressure on w with more territorial meaning.]
;W[me];B[of];W[co];B[jq];W[hb];B[gc];W[id]
(;B[ib]LB[jb:A][gb:B][jd:C]C[I can see why you play this move in that you certainly don't want w's 2 stones to live and separate your group, but this move is classic "bad shape" and should be avoided unless nothing else will do the job. The bad shape is the so-called "empty triangle", 3 stones around the empty point at A. Why is this bad? It is inefficient in that 3 moves are made around 1 point and it is all too easy for b's stones to find that that point is their only liberty.

In this situation, I like the b move B better. This side of b's group is more important than the 2 stones, because b has more invested in terms of number of stones and hopes for territory in the corner. W will hope to exploit his 2 stones to somehow get most of the corner.

C followed by B deserves some consideration in that it gives the b stones more liberties and threatens to separate the w stones. See alternates to this and previous move.]

(;W[ha];B[gb];W[ie];B[ia]C[this move was unnecessary at this point, loss of sente

I totally agree.];W[hq];B[io];W[oh];B[pg]C[Good move.];W[qg]

(;B[ph]LB[qh:A]C[Black is ahead in a "race" between 2 walking or pushing groups. The question is when can he afford to hane to block w's advance. Can he play A now instead of the game move? I think he can (See alternate.) If he waits too long, w will get life on both sides.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[qk]C[Black waited too long to hane. This is a big loss. W has taken a big piece of b's side of the board that he did not have to get.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[ql];W[ng];B[nj];W[ig];B[hg];W[ke]C[See how w anticipates b's next move to give himself good shape?]

[eh:B][ei:C][di:D][dm:E][dg:F][dk:G][ch:H][cm:I][eq:K][dq:L]
[cq:M]C[This move is better to save for later in the game. It gives b some points in gote, but b has bigger fish to fry. He got his nose out with the triangle stones by attacking w's center. Now, he needs to take advantage of that by launching an invasion or reducing move into w's left side. W cannot be allowed to have this whole side. Where is the best place to start is difficult to say. Conservative moves might be A-G. H or I might be too bold. Maybe start with one of K-M in the corner. If b could take the corner and push down the side he would be doing very well.]
;W[ma];B[la];W[sk];B[rl];W[rk];B[pk];W[lj];B[ml]C[B maybe needs to make this move, but the left side is calling.]

;W[hi];B[gi]C[We are entering the endgame and I think w lost more opportunity from the small middle game moves than b did. B's corner is really big and he still has chances to ruin some of w's left and make territory grabbing plays of his own in all 4 corners.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[eg];B[ej]LB[gh:A]C[Oh no! Watch the cut at A!]
;W[cp];B[el];W[gh]C[Good move by white, I should have connected here to make it easier
to live

Yes you had 2 chances. This could be the most important move of the game. It hurts to be destroyed like this, but at least you can see clearly what happened. If you had connected, you would have been able to continue to pillage the left side. Now you are dead.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[gn];W[hn]LB[fn:A][hq:B]C[I am thinking that w should have maybe cut at A instead of or in addition to the game move. He should have aimed at sacrificing the game stone after the cut at A and maybe even the stone at B as well. He needs to hold onto the left side even at considerable cost.]

That is the danger of 3-3 point invasions, but lets see...  See alternate. I don't think you could stop w from taking the corner, but you could gain some leverage to attack the left side. It might turn into an exchange of territories.]

I can't comment on this. The game record has so many illegal moves at this point that I find it hard to correct them and figure out what the real moves were. As far as this game is concerned, I think we have seen most of the important moves.]
