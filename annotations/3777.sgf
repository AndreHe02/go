(;B[cf]TR[jj]C[this is correct, (better than sans san), but still now, a play at K10 is required.

C14 is not consistent with the idea of letting the top right corner open :
- the difference of white or black playing in the corner is about 15 points.
- what you take with a play at C14 is not more.
- the san ren sei opening is an influence game, and while you build it consistently, the value of a play at K10 is now larger than anything on the goban, since it both completes influence and acts as a territorry move.]

The three white stones are strong,

By comparison, the 3 black stones are somewhat weak (no real base) if they come to be cut.

Since the invading white stone will get reinforced, the 3 black stone may suffer if you attack the white stone from P11

I may have chosen a leaning reinforcing attack (see variation)]

this is a wasted move : absolute gote because there is nothing in danger, and even if there was :

- white is already alive, si his group is not at stake
- the maximum penalty would be 2 black stones, that is 4 points ...

Yes, this repays your stone at S7 ...

C[I disagree.

There is no potential here.
You are only despriving white from 15 points in gote

The centre is now beconming huge with a play at G8

10 point left botton
40 point top
5 points right
5 points bottom right


Black only territorry is the centre

- 30 point bottom and right centre
- 10 right
- 5 left

sente before you play R17

you are behind if you don't try to leverage your centre, which is the biggest potential.

Furthermore, you can still reduce white with a big play at H16, you are strong both sides]

All in all I want to do better in the corner invasions, and I wanted to find a way to break up the top
I know keeping that huge moyo on the bottom is unreasonable, but my opponent let me, I should have won for that reason alone I think, something told me his top was not so secure

Ok : I see 2 main things, and a small one

- you missed some opportunity in the chuban (#33)
and in the corner invasions (black and white), but the most critical was the answer to white G5. This is a pure reading problem, and you could usefully practice some tsumego to get trained to a couple of shapes / situations that will help. You had a better opponent at this on this game

- but more serious, you (both) ignored the value of the centre until very late.
By playing there more early, you could have made the game easier for you.

- last, your reduction of the white top was a good idea, but since it is more difficult to master, you chose a way that was less efficient than it should have.
