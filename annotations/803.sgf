C[mc: this was a game between mcshotty 30k (me) black  and soramame 30k as white, on IGS (with byo-yomi set to 15/1). I lost, but it was a close enough game that I think I could have succeeded if I had done a few plays differently. This is my first game submitted to the GTL.  I have added some comments (labelled 'mc') which mostly reflect my after-the-fact thoughts on what would have made a better play.

reviewer: Hi, this is my first review for GTL. I hope that my comments will be helpful for you.

P.S.: I'm a beginner as well, so do not take all my comments 100% serious i might as well be wrong.]
;B[dd]C[reviewer: This is not a serious mistake, but it is considered polite to play the first move in the upper right side of the board. Of course nobody will refuse to play with you just because of your first move ;)]
;W[pp];B[cp];W[oc];B[nq];W[pn]
(;B[no]C[mc: is this good?  I also considered q2 or q3 to limit white in the corner, but those seemed too low.  Or extend back to the star point?

reviewer:
I do not like O5, normaly you play it to run if you do not have space enough to settle your group locally (e.g. when there is a white pincer at M3)

Normally Q2 or K4 is played instead of O5 (see variations)]
;W[jp]C[reviewer: Good white move, he punishes you for not playing K4 yourself]
;B[jc]C[mc: playing on the point of symmetry.

reviewer: when this is the only reason why you played it you should overthink your strategy.
I do not say that it is a bad move but you should certanly have a better reason for that move than playing on the point of symmetry when there is none.]
;W[oq];B[lp];W[jn]
(;B[lr]C[mc: would k2 have been too risky?];W[jr]
(;B[ln]C[reviewer: you can omit this move for running. just go ahead with O7 or N7 (variations)]
;W[eq]LB[eo:A][do:B]C[reviewer: again a very good move of white, this certanly requires a black answer.

A or B might be good choices.];B[nm]C[mc: was still hoping to jump over and connect at the right, containing the lower right white group

reviewer: you do not take your opponents move serious. compare the value of M6 and E3, this exchange was bad for you, and yet you play another slow move instead of answering E3.]
;W[ol];B[om]C[reviewer: this move is questionable, i do not think that it is useful, you just strenghten your opponent while it does nothing for your strong shape]
;W[pm];B[lm]LB[ll:A][kl:B][mk:C]C[reviewer: this is terrible slow, when you want to run play A,B or C instead]
;W[nl];B[kl];W[ml]
(;B[pe]C[reviewer: still you didn't answer E3];W[qc]
(;B[re]C[reviewer: this doesn't look good, normally you would extend here  with this move you allow white to attack your weak group and at the same time extend from his wall.]

(;W[rd]C[reviewer: this white move isn't really needed here]
;B[qe]C[mc: trying to stablize myself as well as building a wall of influence pointing down the right hand side.

reviewer: now you got over concentrated, and your group lacks eyeshape.]

(;W[oe]LB[qi:A]C[reviewer: now white helps you in developing. still you could extend to around A this would hurt white much]
;B[of];W[ne];B[nf];W[le];B[lf]C[mc: continuing to build a wall, though I think the three white stones at o8 neutralize its influence

reviewer:  I do not like the way white played her moves now.
white is not really gaining something from P15 O15 and M15.]

(;W[lc]C[reviewer: this is not good, it's too small to lose sente]
;B[pj]C[mc: start to build a moyo on the side, supported by the wall above, also something for the bottom center group to connect to.

reviewer: nice move, now white is the one being punished for bad moves.]
;W[pk]LB[qo:A]C[mc: could I have accomplished a better invasion of the lower right corner, or did white already have it tightly secured at this point?

reviewer: i'm not absolutly sure if black can successfully invade the bottom right corner, but he can try to start with the peep at A (variation)]

(;B[qj];W[qk];B[rk]C[reviewer: this move is very small (normally you should keep it until endgame) you also have to be sure to keep sente now, because E5, C10 and G17 are big.]
;W[rl]
(;B[rj]C[reviewer: it's more  important to keep sente here and play a big point, just omit S10, you can afford the few points (variation)]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[nj]C[reviewer: white helps you build while gaining nearly nothing]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[li];W[kj];B[lj];W[lk];B[kk];W[ll];B[km];W[mm]
;B[nn];W[ki]
(;B[kh]
(;W[lh];B[mi]C[reviewer: white helped you to protect your weakness]
;W[lg]
(;B[jh]C[mc: wanted to keep the two white stones at L10 out of the top half.

reviewer: your move is ok but there are different possibilities (variation)]
;W[mf];B[kf];W[mg]
(;B[jj]C[mc: I think this last sequence was some bad play by both sides, I just got lucky and came out ahead.

reviewer: i don't like K10, you capture only two stones that had no real chance of escaping anyway and lose sente again]
;W[cf];B[dj]C[mc: d12 here instead maybe, since I was already strong on the top?  Alternatively, f16?

reviewer: it is not easy to estimate your move, but i think it is ok to play there now as long as you take care to play E5 or D5  soon.
F16 should be ok as well];W[fc]
(;B[hc];W[jb]C[reviewer: i don't see white's intention in that move maybe he wanted to connect but this move doesn't help at all]

(;B[cc]C[mc: trying to establish strength for myself and keep white seperated (though it may be too late already for that)]
;W[hb]C[reviewer: i do not think that this white move is good
white shouldn't be able to connect (variation on next move)]

(;B[eb];W[fe];B[df]C[reviewer: mandatory];W[dg];B[ef];W[dh]
;B[eg];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[ei];B[di]C[mc: b7 here instead? By cutting white I forced a decision between e12 and c11, but probably could have found a bigger move.]
;W[ci];B[eh]C[mc: seems like a useful cut

reviewer:  seems to be ok]
(;W[ej];B[cl]C[reviewer: good];W[bk];B[bl];W[ce];B[ed]C[reviewer: wise ;)]
;W[fd]
(;B[hi]LB[gc:A]C[treviewer: his move is not good,  it doesn't really do anything it's not making territory, it doesn't attack and it doesn't defend nor does it create influence. this move is nearly as good as passing.   a black move of A might be cool here (variation)]
;W[il];B[gp]C[good move];W[gq];B[hp]C[mc: f8 or g8 probably would have gotten more territory in the long run, but I wanted to get stable on the bottom edge (and failed)

reviewer: i think f8 or g8 woudn't be good, it's ok to stabelize this group first]
;W[iq];B[ip]C[mc: probably should have skipped back to the left here; I still had some faint hope of conecting with the group to the right.

reviewer: this move is pretty dangerous white could do better]

(;W[hq]C[reviewer: this white move is wrong see variation]
(;B[dr]C[reviewer: not good, it's better to save the three stones here (variation)]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[er];B[cr];W[dp]C[reviewer: here white starts a nice leaning attack]
