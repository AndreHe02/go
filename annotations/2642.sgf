C[Hello, my name is Henrik Sætra, I am 24 years old and from Norway, I wish to thank you very much for taking the time to look at this game of mine and maybe help me reduce just a little of the mistakes I do.

I am black in this game, I play as 3k* on igs and this game is against a player from igs called ozu66, which is 1k*]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[I am currently practicing the Chinese openeing, plus i like it, so I went with that]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[I usually pincer at m17, but thought I'd try pulling back for once, I see people doing that too. :)   Is there much difference between R14 and Q14 here? I chose R14 because I wouldnt like white to get a move around R12 later, but that might be stupid of me.

janr: personally, i prefer Q14 here.

M17 leads often to the variation shown.  After white takes the corner, it will be easy for him to reduce black because r9 is low.
If this stone would be at Q9, this reduction would be more difficult.

Also, the chinese/san-ren-sei is often used in a moyo-building strategy.  One of the ideas is to get either a big point on the upper side or the lower side (K4 or K16 say).  After M17, the upper side becomes uninteresting, and black ends in gote, so white gets the lower side.

Concerning an invasion at R12, notice that white can only invade one side.  E.g. after the common invasion at Q5 in variation, Black will get a stone at P9, which will make R12 impossible, even if R14 is at Q14.]

(;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fq]C[
As all blacks stones are low, he is playing territory-oriented.]
;W[ip];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[ir]LB[pq:A]C[I wanted a base before I started doing anything, plus I think this move is good for making life harder for J4

janr: it is joseki.  Still, with A in place, the variation is an other option that is playable.]
;W[fm]C[
This feels as an overplay as there is no stone supporting the moyo on the left side.]

(;B[lp]LB[in:C][ip:A][ir:B]C[This was a move to continue pressuring J4, to connect my groups a bit and to help the later attack on the approachmove that will come at Q/R5 later. Is the move to vague?

janr: Playing on the left side might be more urgent.

Now, it feels a bit as white has succesfully forced black to play some submissive moves, e.g. after A, black prefers now C instead of B.]
;W[cf]C[
This makes a black group on the left side much more difficult.]
;B[ck]LB[fc:B][ok:A]C[I wanted to get in there now, but didnt know where, so chose there, so I might get a cut around D7 or a group the other way. Waould a move in the G16 area be better?

Because black ignored the left side the previous move, it got more difficult to make a stable group there.  The cut at D7 is not so valuable I think.  

Maybe moves such as A or B are bigger, or it is better for black to play more lightly on the left.]
;W[ci];B[dm]C[
janr: this does not look good.
white could simply connect and get strong, attacking two weak black stones.]

(;W[cm];B[em]
(;W[cl]C[White is too submissive.
He should keep black split.];B[cn]C[
immediately playing at D6 could be a little better.];W[bn];B[en]
;W[co];B[fl]LB[ek:A]C[playing A instead would be bigger.]
(;W[dk]C[I am somewhat pleased with this, at least I got what I see as pretty good influence over the lower center/right part of the board now, but did I give white too much secure territory at the left while getting that influence?

janr: Black gets a quite good result due to whites mistakes.
First, white played submissively.
Next, D9 is a slow move.  It is much better to reduce black.]

(;B[jj]C[This move i was also very insecure about, but I wanted to make my potential greater while I wouldnt like a white move there. How do you feel about a move like this?

janr: the variation gives some alternatives.];W[qo]C[I was waiting for that. I could have enclosed the corner myself, but would rather play at tengen and try to attack the approachmove while building territory from my influence on both sides of that corner.]
;B[qp];W[po]
(;B[np]C[white plays quite heavy];W[qm];B[ok];W[rl];B[rk];W[rp]
;B[rq];W[rn]
(;B[ne]C[This is another point where I didnt really know what to do, but I thought that O15 looked buig anyway, so I played tehre instead of going in to reduce whites area.

janr: I like the variation which enlarges the mioyo in sente after which black can close another side in gote.]
;W[sq];B[rr]LB[dc:A][ke:B]C[Was this too small to reply to at this point of the game? Would L14 for example have been better here?

janr:Replying is indeed small at this stage of the game.
There are big moves such as A and B.];W[lf]C[
janr: very big.

perhaps it is better for black to reduce white now rather than to start a fight immediately.]

(;B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[md];B[me];W[le]C[And we have a fight on our hands..  :)

janr: this is an unfavourable fight, because black is short on liberties
perhaps it is better to first try something else before start the fight.]
;B[je];W[jf];B[ie];W[if];B[ge];W[he];B[hd];W[hf];B[jc];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[fd];B[ic];W[fc];B[gb]C[Did I settle too quick here, should i have tried harder to fight instead of just making life and move on?]
;W[qb];B[rb]C[probably it is not really urgent to play here.
In the end, white plays here only to live, 
While replying is sente at this moment, reading will be required for black to decide at which point to tenuki,
Black can also answer later when he has first taken bigger points.]
;W[pc];B[qd]C[Is this the "correct" place to connect in this situaton?

janr: yes, probably, with s18 present and no atari at O16, this is ok.]
;W[ra];B[sb];W[kb]
(;B[jb]C[
black may tenuki here.
he will not die.]
(;W[mb]C[
janr: i'm not sure this is necessary.  
Will white really die if he plays tenuki?

White would be really happy if he can play tenuki, as black could have taken sente for two moves already.]
;B[fi]LB[fm:A]TR[fg][gg][fh]C[Now I wanted to disrupt whites area while threatening to put G15 to work and expanding my own area too. Was it too far though?

janr: a bit thin due to the aji of A

Also, G15 is very difficult to put into action.
you really need a stone at one of the marked points for that, which might be too close to play immediately.]
;W[fk];B[gk]
(;W[fj];B[gj];W[gi]C[At this point I was very insecure..];B[ei]
C[i chose this move first to gain some time (I was running low on time.)

janr: dangerous, white could decide to go for a trade.]
(;W[dj]
(;B[gh]C[And I thought Id make something of a potential fight here too.
atari on the other side seems bigger.];W[hi];B[ij];W[hh];B[kg]
;W[kf]C[This is dangerous for black, as now, there might be a false eye at K16.]
;B[gg];W[hg];B[gf]C[My plan with these plays was to seal in his group while sacrificing my group (G13-group). I thought I could get him down to enough liberties so that he would have to capture the group, but I guess this was too optimistic :)

White can just ignore te situation, as he can play anytime the sequence in variation and connect or make the semiai much bigger.]

(;W[lh];B[lg];W[mg];B[kh];W[ki];B[li];W[mh];B[ji];W[mf];B[mi]
;W[oh]C[I'm not sure wether I like this or not. At least I get to solidify my influence in the lower side, but at the cose of my left side.]
;B[ni];W[pg];B[nh];W[ng];B[of];W[og]
(;B[qh];W[pf]C[It seems that black loses the game here.];B[qg]
;W[od];B[ee]C[Now I wanted to see if I could make something of that group
janr: perhaps black is wasting many endgame points here.  e.g. f18 is very big for black.]
;W[fb];B[nd];W[oe];B[di];W[ch];B[ed];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[eg]
C[I see i cant make two eyes, but I thought I might get some opportunities to do something at the top corner or left side through this

janr: I dont think so, white can safely tenuki it seems?]
(;W[fe];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg];W[ff];B[cj];W[dl];B[om]C[I left for now, but I did think I might get to do something at the top left later on.]
;W[on];B[nn];W[op];B[oq];W[pm];B[ol];W[hb]C[I didnt think about this, stupid of me, now the group is dead.. At least as far as I can see :)]
;B[ha]C[So i decided to try my plan on the left side/corner, this move was to prepare for the ko I was hoping he it would get me.]
;W[jd];B[bh];W[bi];B[bf];W[ah];B[cd]
(;W[be];B[ec];W[db]C[janr: this does not seem optimal for white.
the variation a few moves earlier prevents this.];B[eb];W[ea]
C[There, I got the ko, I was happy with this after the group had died, at least I could get a ko for soemthing, allthough I didnt have many kothreats that were big enough.. :)]
;B[fa];W[ga];B[ek]C[This was the only big threat I saw I think]
;W[hc];B[ej]C[So I was somehwat satisfied with saving that group too, it would be many points for him, but he did kill the top side group, but I think thats smaller.]

As I said, this is a game i was pretty satisfied with, but I bet its full of mistakes, but i cant see them so well. :)

Anyway, thank you very much once again for taking the time to look at this game, I hope it wasnt too boring for you. :)
