C[I am black.I don't know my ranking.For the opening (moves 1-16), is it go= od to do what I did (i.e. cover more area with a weaker connection of stone=
s) or is it better to do what white did (i.e. cover less area with a strong= er connection of stones)?

RCarter: First: in a Go game player's goals are different. Black's goal are (in order of importance) 1) make territory 2) Avoid that White make territory;
White's goal are 1) Avoid that Black make territory 2) Make territory.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd];B[ij]C[RCarter: Very unusual move, better and simpler R13, L16, K4 etc.]
;W[cj];B[hd]C[RCarter: Another unusual move: in the beginning of a game you must define your territory with a few moves, and your territory can't be too weak (that means that you can't leave alone a lot of stones, like Q16, 3). You can't hope to obtain the whole goban, you only need a point  over your enemy to win! You'd better enforce your first moves]
;W[qj]C[RCarter: White invade where you are weaker];B[ok]C[RCarter: Better Q10 to let white live small]
;W[gj];B[hm]C[RCarter: Better enforce your corners or contain white's R10]

;W[cs];B[er]C[RCarter: not useful: if White E2 you capture with E1]
;W[do];B[dm]C[RCarter: No, better F6, so you connect and you'll be stronger for the center]
;W[fn]C[RCarter: Too late];B[em];W[fl];B[fk]C[Is move #47 a good one? Would i= t have been better if I had placed that stone diagnally to the 3-stone chai= n?

RCarter: No, I think this is a nice move, but also White help you to win with next moves]

[ss]C[Thank you for taking the time to look over my=  game and to help me become a better player.

RCarter: In my opinion you have to focus you attention and improve in:
1) Beginning of the game;
2) More attention on your cutting point and where you cut
3) You must know when a group has no chance to live, when you know it, leave it!
4) Some of your moves weren't necessary and there were more important moves to do

But don't worry, you aren't bad! This  is an avversary you can beat if you pay more attention.
Hi and see you in KGS (I'm RCarter).])
