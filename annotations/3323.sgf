C[[Rilvar\] Hi, I'm new to online playing, and this is the first game I've submitted to GTL.  Overall, there's a few things that I think could use improvement in my games.

 - Influence on center.  I seem to do fairly well at taking corners, but I often find my opponent with huge center territory that ultimately wins the game.  Any suggestions?

 - Destroying Invasions.  I am pretty weak at destroying invasions (as was done in the upper left corner this game), is there some key points I'm missing here, or do I need to recognize weak areas in my territory?

 - Making Invasions.  I have a hard time judging if an invasion can live, and then making enough living space... after the borders were semi-formed, were there any good opportunities that I missed?

Otherwise, thanks for reviewing this game!

[H\] Hello, here's Hannes, so I'll mark my comments with [H\] 

It would be nice to get some response on whether my remarks were useful. And feel free to ask via email, if something is unclear or if you have more questions.

To the questions above (after commenting the game):

1) In this game it's not so much "corner vs. influence" but "how to make the oponents potential territory smaller without making him too strong."
And you are right: keep access to the center (not to make territory there, but to prevent your oponent from doing so).

2) The 3-3 corner invasion against the 4-4 is  usually (i.e. without surrounding stone) nothing you can prevent unless you play some more stones in this corner before.  But there were some mistakes that I point out in the game.

3) Making invasions: As I comment on your invasion, there are some things that make the (really difficult!) search for good invasion points more easy.
a) The aim: Be sure about why you are invading. Is it for settling yourself in this place (which means you have to get eye-space there) or is it to harm your oponent's position (then, you don't have to build a living shape, but should at least be able to escape into and connect with friendly areas).
b) And if you know your aim and look for good invading points, think of counterstrategies against moves that prevent you from extending in some direction.]

C[[H\] Bothing to worry about; Whites move at A was perfectly well. 

But let's have a look at the overall situation on the board.

1) White has made sure territory in the upper left with  a good possible extension to B. C is open to extensions on both sides, making B even more attractive.

2) Black has only potential territory. He placed his stones nearly unconnected and hopes that they will become helpful in the future.

It's easy to understand, that sooner or later, White must aim at reducing blacks potential territory, but there's one thing, he has to keep in mind: every attack (invasion) makes Black's weak stones stronger and will transform some of Black's potential territory into real points.

There's no way out of this dilemma (besides killing Blacks groups) so White will have to adapt his strategy.]

(;W[nq]LB[jq:B][lq:C][nq:A][oq:D]C[[H\] The idea of playing on the lower side fits Whites strategy in making Blacks potential territory smaller. 

But I'm not so sure about whether A was the best choice. Especially: if Black responded with C instead of D,  White would have had to evade into the center, letting black strengthen his position while he attacks white.

Look at the variations for an outline of an invasion at B instead of A.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[on]LB[on:B][pn:C][np:A]C[[H\] White A is a reasonable move, especially if compared to how the situation would look like, if Black played there.

I would have played black B at C, but that's a matter of style, as B is more aggressive while C makes the corner territory more secure.

But anyway: White could have expected something like this as Blacks answer to A.  Up to now, the situation seems not to have made Black potential territory much smaller, but has strentghened his now extended corner.

But the sequence is not finished yet...];W[jp]LB[nq:A]C[[H\] good extension (one more than the size of  the wall that you expand from, as the rule-of-thumb says)

the drawback (which results from attacking at A) is: Black has the lead now and can attack White while  (at the same time) strengthening his loosely connected stones.

It's important to check whether the result of one's move compensates for loosing sente (the active part). And I'm in doubt here.]
;B[hq];W[jq];B[ho]TR[jc][qg][pk][ol][pl][cm][dm][pm][cn][dn]
[dp][hq]C[[H\] This result does not look too good for White.

He succeded in splitting Black's potential territory but Black is strenghtened on both sides such that the splitting is not very valuable.
At least White has access to the center.

Black has extended his left corner with a very good shape (see the marked stones).

There are still invasion possibilities for white on both sides as well as extensions on the upper side and on the right.]
;W[lo]LB[lo:A]C[[H\] I think White lost one move here.  The idea for playing A was probably to secure White's territory by closing the upper side of the A-group.

But this group was not meant to get White lots of points. It aimed at making Black's potential territory smaller, and A does not do the trick.]
;B[lm]LB[jc:C][pl:B][lm:A]C[[H\] white should see the danger of being closed in, here. And notice, that A makes invasions around B much more difficult.

White C is still a good idea, but probably ( I really cannot judge this) not as important as loosing  access to the center.]
;W[jd];B[qg];W[qf];B[pg];W[pf]LB[qe:B][qf:A][qg:C]C[Defending at A nearly necessarily results in this situation which is already quite valuable for Black  (even without the wall that later emerged.

If White's aim simply was to defend the corner, B would have done the job. Remember that contact-moves make the approached stone (C, in this case) stronger.]

[sk][cl][dl][ol][pl][ql][rl][sl][cm][dm][om][pm][qm][rm][sm]
[cn][dn][jn][pn][qn][rn][sn]C[[Rilvar\] It seemed like this wall would benefit me as it was so far from the board edge, but it gave black large influence on the center... was this improperly played?

[H\] I would say so.

First, it's nearly always bad if you are the one behind in some wall-building.

And second: Even if Black could not invade your corner at A (I'm not sure whether he could), have a look at possible attacks of the Black and White territory.

If Black attacks at B, White's corner is quite big. But if White attacks at C, Black gets nearly the same number of points *plus* his lower right corner. 

And this already gives a hint on possible other white moves:

1) Stop the wall building, secure your corner and connect (loosely) with the marked stone on the upper side by  playing B
2) Attack Black with  C or a point in its neighbourhood (playing D or E would be more aggressive, making sure that Black responds). This would result in making Blacks territory small (and quite secure) *and* to get influence into the center.

3) Invading on the left is still an option, as well as extending on the left side (above F), but I think they are not as big as the proposals above.]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[lg]C[[H\] That's the problem with pushing the wall from behind: Black can decide, whenther to go on or whether to jump like here.]
;W[kf]LB[ee:D][ge:C][le:A][lf:B]C[[H\] I cannot see the aim of this move. If it is defending the white territory, then A or B would have been better (as they are better connected to the wall).]
;B[lf];W[le];B[kg];W[ke]LB[ke:B][jf:A]C[[H\] White could have played A instead of B, which  (though a bit more tricky, if Black starts fighting) would have served the same purpose.]
;B[ig];W[ch]LB[fe:B][he:C][cg:A][ei:F][cj:D][cm:E]C[[H\] I'm not sure about that one either. On the one hand, it prevents Black from extending to A. But on the other hand, a move around B or C would have been bigger.

Second: It provokes an reaction from Black that will inescapably result in making D stronger. Even if Black goes the smooth way by responding with E, his profit (making invasions nearly impossible)  is by far bigger than the few points of territory, White gets.

So: Invading somewhere around E is another option for White. As is going into the center by playing F or the like.]
;B[ej];W[eh];B[gh];W[ff]LB[fi:A]C[[H\] Both sides are quite happy with these moves, as both close their territory. But notice that Black is vulnerable at A.]
;B[jj]LB[jn:A]C[[H\] I don't know why Black played here. closing White in at A would be better.]
;W[cn]LB[he:F][bk:D][cn:B][en:E][bp:C][cp:A]TR[cq]C[[H\] By choosing an invasion point, you have (1) to have a specific aim and (b) to have counterstrategies to the attacks that will follow.

I don't see the aim here.  if Black simply plays A, white is in danger, especially as the two-space jump is not available here.

And for the counterstrategies: The rule of thumb says that an invasion stone should have at least three directions in which he can extend. So he has two left, if the defender answers. 
In this case,  B can slide to C and D, and escape to E, but escaping to E is not really an option, as he runs into black territory with no help in sight.

The 3-3 invasion of the corner would be another possibility, which would take some points from black, giving him walls, that do not help him in the rest of the game, as this territory already is his.

Closing at F would be quite big. Although there is some space for an invasion ( the the upper side is empty to the third line), I would recommend this.]
;B[en]C[[H\] This black move gives white  the chance to make his invasion a success....]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[do];B[eo];W[cl];B[dn];W[co];B[cm]
;W[bm];B[dm]C[[H\]... which White happily accepts :-) Well done!]
;W[jn];B[hl]LB[im:A]C[[H\] Extending to A would have been a good idea, as Black now has to decide whether he should stop White by blocking the left or the upper side. He cannot do both though.]
;W[jl];B[jm]C[[Rilvar\] Black ended up separating one of my stones with this move... is there a better way to connect?

[H\] no, regardless of the side you play, there are always two cutting points for black. But it's a good example, that the one-space jump is not *always* save.]
;W[im];B[km];W[in];B[il];W[mn];B[kn];W[ko];B[io];W[jo];B[mm]
;W[hc]LB[hc:A][he:B]C[[H\] Playing A is all right here. B would make the territory bigger, but (as was said before) could be dangerous.]
;B[pr];W[mc]LB[mc:B][oc:C][mf:A]C[[H\] I think, White should just connect at A.  There is very little space here for Black to get settled, and if White insists on securing, he could play C, as B does not prevent the 3-3 invasion.]
;B[qc]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[[H\] There is a lot of things, one could say about this invasion, but the most important is: The defender can choose, in which the situation develops. Playing A makes Black respond at B and vice versa. 
(usually, but not here, though :-) 

And if the invasion succeeds, the intruder will live, giving the defender a strong outer wall. That's the reason for not invading as soon as possible, but to wait for a situation, where the wall does not help the defender any more.]
;W[qd]C[[H\]   I cannot judge whether there is a way for white to kill Black without any escape, but some White moves were wrong, so I'll concentrate on them in the following.]
;B[rd];W[pc]C[[H\] Whites aim is to make Blacks group as small as possible, hoping that it ends in some dead shape. this move does the job quite well.]
;B[re];W[rf]C[[H\] cutting Black off is a must.];B[qb];W[pb]
;B[ra];W[pa]LB[pa:A]C[[H\] This move is of no value. If the fight is about live and death here,  all that counts are eyes, and even if Black comes to play A, this does not give him an eye. So white looses one move here.]
;B[sf]
(;W[sg]LB[rg:A]C[[H\] playing at A would have been better, as it does not change the situation concearning live and death, but takes some points off Black's territory.

And: White would not loose sente (see the variation)];B[sb]
;W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[nn]C[[H\] I won't say much about the next moves, but keep in mind that you play these endgame moves first, where you do not loose sente.

(And if you have to choose between two moves that both let you keeping sente, choose the one, which would let your opponent keep sente, if he was to play. But that is not so important, as beginner's games tend to be lost by lots of points. Mine still do.)]
;W[no];B[ln];W[mo];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[rh];B[qi]
(;W[ri]LB[sk:A]C[[H\] The monkey-jump at A would have hurt Black more.]

;B[fg]
(;W[ef]LB[eg:A]C[[H\] playing A would been better. White probably feared an atari, but Black could not have made anything dangerous (see variation)]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[de]C[[H\] Not necessary. What should Black do?]

TR[qi][qj][rj]C[[Rilvar\] I know there was more space in the center-right, but it seemed like I had a better chance here because of the possible connection above...

[H\] As to the last invasion: What does White aim at, here?  Does he want to live inside the Black territory, then he would have to got fot the side, btu there is not enough space. 

Planning to cut the marked stones off seems impossible to me.

Have a look on how the situation changed:

2) A and B are nearly as weak as before
3) White has somewhat settled himself on the lower side and has access to the middle of the board. 
4) Black is divided.

Possible follow-ups for White are: 
1) Cutting off A or B from  the corner groups
2) Extend on the upper side
3) Extend the lower white group (but then White should invest some time checking, how much Black profits from his defending moves).]
