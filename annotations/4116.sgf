C[Sub: I'd really like to know about my  weak points and strong points, often I don't know when it's time to tenuki and where is big moves :)

C[Sub: I didn't know how to play here.

GY: I think the result is better for black here, as his group is somewhat settled, and very solid. White, on the other hand, needs to play 2 moves rather urgently. (A and B)]
;W[ep]TR[bi][aj][cj][bk]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[GY: I think this is a bit risky. White could set up a splitting attack. See variation. (a)

I think the better move here would be to simply defend the marked white group, with B or something similar.]

(;B[dq];W[cn];B[eq];W[jc]TR[dq]C[GY: Although I still say the result so far is better for Black, I'd say White is lucky Black played a submissive move (the triangle marked stone), and let White settle all his groups.]

;B[of];W[qf];B[le]C[Sub: Here I was afraid that this is n17 k 17 group is too weak and tried to reinforce it.

GY: I don't think it's really weak. They can be connected easily. However, I wouldn't say defending it is a bad idea.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[me];B[ne];W[mf]C[GY: This is a good move. White is strong in this area, so he can afford to attack at a large scale.]

I would consider playing something along the lines of A.];B[pn]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[oj];B[qh]C[Sub: Didn't know how to deal with this.

GY: Black plays a lot of overplays, that's for sure. He has one group already weak, and he's letting you set up a splitting attack here.]

C[GY: White did fine in this game, except for a few mistakes in the endgame and opening. I think White needs to concentrate more on his opening moves, and also on how to react to overplays by the opponent (you did well for the most part).

Apart from that, White should consider losing a few points of territory in order to save a potentially larger group as well (try counting).

That's all then.])
