C[Sick: Have a nice game
*NANAKO3*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.


Overall Black plays fairly well, and could have created a closer game if some of the mistakes were not made.  Blacks opening is stronger than whites, however white reduces white's territory a lot, which results in the black loss.

I hope that this review provides insight to your game

Cheers,

If white hadn't played D17 and instead D16 I'd say ok to Q10.

Perferably is any one of the points shown.
The board is unbalanced in that corner, in that white's position demands a response, where as the rest of the board is balanced.]

(;B[qo]LB[ql:A]C[If this stone was meant to attack white's R6, it fails miserably.

Contrary to many beginners ideas, R5 is actually a defensive move.  It says this is my corner.  The result of by move 18 is a clear indicator of this.

A better move, especially with blacks support on the upper right side is A.  White is then forced to run into the center and black can continue to build influence for Q4 along the bottom. (See move 14)]

See next move for comment];B[gk]LB[ne:D][cj:E][gk:A][hk:B][gl:C]
C[A may have been a bit too close.

Ideally the way that black handles this, is by trying to drive white into the wall that has been created along 15.

B would probably prove to be the best move in this situation since black also has a wall along 5, but white has the possibility of escaping and running towards D.  Playing at B reduces that possiblity.

Caution must be taken to prevent E from being attacked which could lead to the loss of the left side.]

C[A is better.  If white plays B, black need only play C and black will gain sente.]
