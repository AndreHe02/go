AB[cc][qc][dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp][cq][qq]C[Hey,

my name is Jan, I'm a 13 kyu on KGS and will try my best to review your game.

However, I have to confess that I have never played, or even seen, a game with a larger handicap than 9, let alone one with 13 stones. Therefore I was forced to come up with my opinion without a real back-up provided by game experience or books. Hopefully you will still find this review worth your while. 

Please feel free to contact me via mail or on KGS (my nick is Aveneer) for additional questions.

[ri][rj]C[where else can i play? i play here thinking that later i will manage the center.

--

J: I think your choice (and the triangles) are a good play; they avoid being too close to the strong corners and offer some possible follow ups to build a base (see squares). 

Alternatives might be the circles, which would on the one hand be farer away from blacks 2 stones in the corner, but on the other hand could be pincered against as with R14, for instance. Playing on the 4th line might be safer, but due to the extreme handicap you will have to desperately play for territory so I wouldn't advise it.]
;B[md];W[mc]C[trying to complicate things and to eliminate all plans of territory of B inmediately.

--

J: Hitting a stone like that nearly always strenghtens it. M17 is a better choice; however, both moves aren't the biggest ones available. Either you could try to build a base at the R13 stone with a move like S11, try to jump to P15 in the hope of building some influence or play at something like C7 or R7. Maybe I'd go for S11; or R11, hope for R10, and extend to S15.]

(;B[nc]C[J: I think this is the wrong direction, pushing white away from blacks stronger stones. See variation.]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[kc]C[J: I would have prefered a jump to K17 so black can't confine you with that move. See variation.]

C[going for the center as soon as possible. i usually jump just one space but i cant have that luxury now.

--

J: Risky, with all the black influence. Still, you really need to neutralize some of it, or else...]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[qe]TR[oi][qi][ri]SQ[ch][cn]C[J: I marked a couple of alternatives for your next move. The triangle moves R11 and S11 are supposed to build a base and aim to more plays on the side. P11 could reinforce, if not stabilize, your weak group, and threaten Q10 in the process - which, again, might help with a play in the lower right side. 

The squares show some possibilities for tenuki. C12 might be more interesting than C13 since you can avoid getting too close to blacks strong influence in the top. C6 is the biggest move for opening up new territory.

Maybe I would choose C12.];W[cg]C[i felt i had to leave things unfinished at the right side to play first at another place.]

;B[gf]C[J: Should be F10 or G10.];W[gh];B[ih];W[fj]C[it feels good to play here and getting some shape and also pushing openly to other scenario.

J: This result was very bad for black. White now has the potential to build eyes and a new direction to flee, while black has made little territory whilte attacking white yet.]

J: I would have preferred G3 here, since your group on the left might be usefull. Or go for O3.

Remember what I said about played directly next to a stone!]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[qh];W[lg]TR[mi]C[making space for later making shape...but now i think  that B can attack this center group by playing around the triangle.

--
J: Agreed. I would prefer a white play at N11 instead of one a M13. Like this, white is heading towards a black wall. With N11, hes heading towards (yet) empty space, away from black's thickness at the top and aiming to seperate black groups.]
;B[fg];W[ci];B[fh];W[di];B[rg];W[mi]C[J: That was important.]
;B[hi]C[B is insisting in this side];W[ck];B[gi];W[qm]C[J: Here, I think continuing the seperation plan - and neutralizing blacks influence towers the middle south east - would be in order first. Maybe O9 or M9.]

;B[pm];W[ql];B[ln];W[iq]C[i think is best to extend to the other side where B is strong and take the risk.

--

J: Well, the left seems more interesting to me, as well, but only due to the fact that your white group at E7 might provide you with some help to keep sente. 

I wouldn't play so slowly, though - you have to hurry to reduce his territory and make your own! H3 would be a good start. Remember: When you're far behind - and you probably still are - you'll need to play fast and effectively, and jumps are cut out for that!]

--

J: Good idea.];B[fr];W[gq];B[gp];W[hp]C[J: Too slow. I'd suggest playing E5 in sente, since black will most likely want to defend against the F4 cut, then play N2, wait for O2, and try attacking B6 next - not to kill it (see later comments), but in the hope of reducing his territory further.]

(;W[jg]C[i still feel insecure with this group

--

J: Yes, the group's status is hard to tell. Connecting at M11 doesn't seem to be good enough for it to make life, though, so K13 seems reasonable to have any chance for life.

I included a bunch of variations that I could think of. I'm not too sure about them, though. Judging from them, however, it would appear as though white cannot make life.]

(;B[ig];W[jh];B[ji];W[li]C[J: Alive!];B[kj];W[kf]C[J: Unnecessary. The group is already alive, and the left side - both top and bottom - is more interesting for making territory or reducing your opponent's.]

J: Firstly, I'd like to say that you played quite well, a) making sure your opponent doesn't secure his territory while you're busy securing your own, and b) keeping the initiative through a lot of the game.

Why, then, did you loose? I'd say mostly because of your failure to spread your territory wide enough. Looking at the board, you'll notice how you effectively destroyed black moyo, but how you only have a bit of your own. Thats because you didn't make use of jumping moves like you should have done, especially on the top and the lower sides, but also in the middle during midgame.

The second reason, perhaps somewhat more minor and uncertain, for your loss is that you didn't take the chance to reinforce your center group and seperate black's. A play there would have prevented you from being forced to worry about your groups and, thus, would have given you a chance to reduce his territory there. 

You gave me an interesting and unique game to work on. I hope this review will add a bit to what you learned in it.]
