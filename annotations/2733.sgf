C[NB:
Hi,
In this game I played as white and lost by resign.
I went through the game myself and pointed up some occasions where I'd like to get some advices.
But of course feel free to comment on any point you like.

Thanks in advance

Mimulus:  
Hi.  I've done my best to see where you might have improved your moves, but please keep in mind I could always be wrong.  

All in all, I think you played better then you realized, which led to some overly aggressive play at the end.  Try getting yourself to count the score as the endgame approaches and you could win more games like this one.  (That's advice I myself would do well to listen to!)  

I hope my review proves useful.  Good luck!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]

;W[cm];B[cq]C[NB:
At that point I was thinking:
"Black has three weak stones. I'm going to keep them separated, chase them and the game will be a piece of cake !"
But eventually, black settled all groups quite easily.

See the upcoming situation after move 44
---
Mimulus:  You were right to feel optimistic.  I think black's move here is not a good idea.  It allows you to build strength against the other two weak black stones, and when the corner sequence was over things looked good for white.  As I'll point out, though, I think you could have been more aggressive after that.]

(;B[cf]C[I think this is a little too loose, considering white's strength below.]

(;W[ce]LB[ce:1][df:2]TR[dj]C[A thank you move.  Black is delighted to exchange 1 for 2 and get the ideal formation with the triangled stone:  a 3 space extension from 2 stones.   I think you can make better use of your strength in this area and attack more aggressively.  See variation.]

TR[de][cf][df][dj]C[NB:
I have no corner nor side at the bottom and the left. So I feel quite dissatisfied
Did I do something wrong?
---
Mimulus:  To my earlier comments I'd add that you could still profit by attacking the marked stones, maybe at A.  All in all, I'd say that you're not that badly off, although black did come out a bit ahead from this.  But I'm not sure you should leave out B.  I don't like the implications of black moving there.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[NB: Wrong direction I think

Mimulus:  I think it's okay.  I often make the same choice in order to use the resulting thickness to weaken white's topside.]

[ch:C][pj:B][mn:D]C[NB:
Mistake
Black P19 next threatens the corner

Instead of O18, what is the biggest point:
Near Q10? near C12? elsewhere?
---
Mimulus:  Yeah, this move is damaging to you.  My strong first choice is A.  It completes a great looking formation on the top for you.  (Black can then expand his moyo even further around E or D but then you can make the game close with a good attack around C.) Somewhere around B is also urgent.

Now that I look it at more.  D looks bigger.  A black play there would hurt you alot.  Jeez, I can't decide between A or D.]
;B[oa];W[me];B[nd];W[md];B[na];W[pj]LB[jc:A][fj:C][mn:B]C[NB:
If black Q19, white can live with a ko.
Do you agree?
---
Mimulus:  Yes.  However it's just not a very desirable situation for you.  That is a big ko to have to fight  especially since black doesn't stand to lose a thing from it.  But at this point, maybe you were right to leave the corner to a ko and play Q10 since black is pulling ahead now.  After all, black never played Q19 anyway.

Instead of Q10, I prefer A, B, or maybe C, though.];B[qj];W[qp]
C[NB:
A bit risky...
C12 better?
P19 urgent
---
Mimulus:

I don't like it.  It feels like a panic move to me.  Suppose you live in the corner:  You'll be tightly sealed in and your group to the left will be seriously weakened by black's resulting thickness.  I would continue tending to the Q10 stone, or get that flexibility for your N4 group with N6.]

[mg:C][pi:B]C[Mimulus: A, B, or C look bigger to me right now.]
;B[pi];W[kf]C[NB:
Now I have to capture J14, else I loose the game.

I've often lost games in that configuration. I mean trying to capture a large group. And at the end, my oponnent connects and I have to resign.
So i'm interested in your opinion as to:
1) whether capturing J14 is an easy/reasonnable/desperate goal
2) How you would proceed if you were white
---
Mimulus:  I'm not convinced that you can kill it, but I'm not convinced it's necessary either.  I'd chase it just a little to link up with the still vulnerable N4 group and maybe gain some center strength, but trying to kill it will probably not help you.  P10 is probably an important move for you too.  But from then on I'd focus on endgame:  e.g. Q10, M18, F17, etc.

In your games you might want to think about whether you really need to kill a group that is weak, because often you can gain much by chasing it to build strength.  And you can lose much by trying to kill and then failing.]

;B[hk];W[gk];B[il]C[NB: No more questions.
Consider I resigned there.

Mimulus:  But I'd say you're still very much in the game!  Here's where you need to try to relax, take a breath, and forget about the black group that you thought you had to kill.  Just look at the whole board afresh.  Black really doesn't have all that much more than you, so try and find the sente endgame moves, then the big endgame moves, and you might just chip away until you're ahead.

Instead, you got caught trying to unnecessarily take too much out of Black's right side territory.]
