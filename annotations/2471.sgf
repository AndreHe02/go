AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, i'd like you to comment this game for me.
I am white (EmptyMind), my name is Eric.
I think this was a strange game, but i do not know exactly why...]
;W[qf];B[rd]C[Is this a normal answer from black? What are the advantages VS disadvantages and was my ans. good?

[ I don't think this is a normal answer.  Usually I would expect something around O16/O17, or a pincer. 

The advantage of this move could be that it puts a lot of pressure on your R14 stone 

The disadvantage might be that black really needs another move around O17, or else this becomes a good move for white later... \]]
;W[of]C[[ I think i would have either made an extension down the right side, or else leave this stone for now, and play in a corner 

The problem with this move is that it encourages black to play another fourth line move at O16 getting him quite a big corner. \]]
;B[nd];W[pj];B[cd];W[lc]C[Was this attack prematurate?
Where were bigger points?

[ The lower right corner is still open.  Or an approach move at E17/E18...  \]]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[lb];W[kb];B[nb];W[ec];B[cb];W[ee];B[df];W[de]
C[[ This move invites black to connect at C15, and doesn't really help white too much either.  You might have been able to build a position on the left side, which might have forced black to connect later, but now that possibility is gone. \]]
;B[ce];W[fg];B[eh]C[Up to there, and with my next move that attack the left group, I thought I had the upper hand...
Is it the case?

[ I agree, i think you are doing fine.  I think that maybe its better for you to take the lower right corner now though... \]]
;W[eg]C[[ Again, you are forcing black to connect without really getting to much in return.

These kind of forcing moves for no real gain could be called "aji keshi" I think... \]]
;B[dg];W[cj];B[ci];W[dj];B[qp];W[di];B[ch];W[dh]C[Here, did i push too far?

[ Nah, this cut is huge!  Very good move \]];B[bj];W[bk];B[ai]
;W[cn];B[bp];W[qn]C[should I have continued around  b6 ?

[ No, B6 is strong enough to leave now. R6 is ok, but maybe P4/P3 could have been better since this move invites black to enclose the corner \]]
;B[oo];W[pn]C[[ You need something faster, like maybe P7...  This move is just asking for black to take a good point at P6 \]]
;B[on];W[pp]C[??? a move i tried, was not good

[ I agree :) \]];B[po];W[op]C[should i have added the stone at Q3 ?

[ I don't know if Q3 will work, but it looks like it has better chances than this, because it will have more liberties \]]
;B[np];W[qo];B[pq];W[rp];B[qq];W[iq];B[gq];W[lq];B[ip];W[mq]
;B[nq];W[hq];B[hp];W[jp]C[is this a good sequence to settle my group?

[ It seems fine to me...  I'm not that great at knowing when/how to settle groups \]]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[jo]C[same thing as earlier... Up to now, I thought I was winning!
What is you analysis of the situation at this point?
What are the big points now?];B[go];W[eo];B[ep];W[do];B[co]
;W[dn]C[[ You should know this shape is not too great...  I like D7 better here \]]
;B[bn];W[bm];B[an];W[fi]C[[ Very important move to make.  Good timing, I think. \]]

;B[mf];W[md];B[mg];W[nh];B[mh];W[nj];B[ni];W[oi];B[og];W[oh]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[kc]C[I'm losing control here, what should i have done to prevent or avoid such a situation?

[ if you wanted the huge center - you might have tried to play 79 around N15 to stop black from getting in that way... but then you would lose something on the side - I think this is an ok situation, but you should try not to make your strategy count on a kill... I know that can be hard to remember sometimes :) 

Another way to handle this situation could have been to play 93 around K15...  or something to save M16 stones from danger, build some top-side territory and attack black at the same time... \]]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[jb];W[ki];B[kf];W[jf];B[kh];W[jh]C[Tring to capture, here. I thought mabe that was one of the reasons I lost...]
;B[li]C[[ Actually i think if you just play L10 here (instead of M10), you have a pretty good chance of killing everything... \]]
;W[lj];B[jg];W[ig];B[ji];W[kj];B[ih];W[if];B[le];W[lg];B[kg]
;W[jj];B[ij];W[hi]C[I think I should have played P7 from a long time, here]

;B[cl];W[dk]C[[ As you saw later, you could have lost your group.  If you play 169 at C9 instead you could save it. B8 also works, but C9 is better style because you want to play stones on your living groups first in case you decide to give up the dead side in a ko later... \]]
;B[am];W[aj]C[He had my group but didnt capture... Dunno what happend. I think he simply did not see it.

[ yep!  very lucky for you!  i guess you have to count on mistakes as white in a hanidcap game \]]

(;W[kq]C[wonder if i didnt make the wrong choice  :p

[ Hmm, you did :)  Let this be a lesson in counting...

with your move, consider everything in this area, with your move at L3 followed by blacks move at P3, you got one stone, and 7 points of territory (5 empty spaces plus the dead stone at L2)... so you got 8 points.  black captures two stones and makes three points of territory...  5 points... so this way you made 3 more points in this area than your opponent.  and you got sente.

if you play O4 instead, black will play L1.  you will capture 7 stones and make seven points of territory, (14 points) and black will capture 5 stones and make five points of territory (10 points) that way you made 4 more points than black, and you also have sente.  plus the O3 stones will be in atari so you could capture those for more points later. \]]
