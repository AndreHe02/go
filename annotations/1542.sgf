RE[B+13.5]

;B[qd]C[I try my best effort in this game. I think I make a few losing move and lead me to a hard place. The beginning is not good. Black get a lot of place and difficult for me to attack. Beside, my attack point have problem.

ug: Hello! I reviewed your game. Actually, I think that in the beginning white was clearly ahead. But later, white made several moves which did not really achieve anything, so black came back into the game.

For what it's worth, my strength is around 3d KGS.];W[dq];B[dd]

(;W[op];B[np];W[oo]
(;B[mq]C[ug: Not so good, because white is very happy to play at Q3.]
;W[pq]C[ug: Good.];B[jq];W[qk];B[dj];W[gq]C[ug: This move looks too small. The black group at the bottom is pretty strong, so the only thing this moves achieves is to take a few points. Playing at P16 or F17 would have been better.]
;B[od];W[qg];B[gc];W[cf];B[ch]C[ug: This is not ideal for black, since the D10 stone is too close to the C12 stone.]
;W[cc]C[ug: White is happy to invade the corner.];B[dc];W[cd]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cm]C[ug: White has a good game now.];W[bn]C[ug: Too small. This is really just an endgame move. Breaking out with D14 looks interesting. Playing aroung K15 might also be good.]
;B[bm]C[ug: Also too small. Black should not answer here.];W[db]
;B[eb]N[After 30 move, I think is even];W[cb]
(;B[ge]C[ug: Too close to the D15 wall.];W[iq]C[ug: This doesn't help white, but it makes black stronger, so it's a bad move. Locally, J2 looks better, but there are more important points on the board right now. Either reducing black's top moyo with L15 or something like that, or expanding the white moyo, maybe with P13, might be good.
P13 has the additional benefit that it makes reducing black's moyo a bit easier, since it is on (or close to) the sectorline of the two moyos.]
;B[jp];W[jr];B[kr];W[hr];B[pm];W[kq]C[ug: This only strengthens black.]

;B[nm];W[pl]C[ug: Not necessary];B[nn];W[qo]C[ug: Again, this is not necessary. Now black has reduced your territory in a significant way, and in sente. You didn't have to allow that.]

has a better outside];W[qf];B[ph];W[rf];B[of];W[ob]C[ug: Too deep. Maybe K12 or so is playable. Then white certainly is istill in the game.]

;B[sd];W[se];B[sc];W[ll];B[mm];W[po];B[pf];W[sg]C[Summarizing, you should try to think harder about the purpose of each of your moves. Ask yourself questions like: Is it necessary to answer here? Where is the most important area of the board right now?

You can easily become a tone or two stronger, if you avoid playing moves that serve no purpose. (I know that this is easier said than done, but I'm sure that trying to do this will help you improve your game.)

Good luck!]N[Finally, I lose 13.5])
