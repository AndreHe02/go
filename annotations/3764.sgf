RE[B+Resign]

C[xedover:  Thank you for reviewing our game.

I think I focused too much on trying to kill some of black's groups.  How could I have played differently to keep black's territory small (instead of trying to kill) while keeping my groups safer.

Sometimes I think protect when I don't need to, but at other times don't realize when I need to protect still.

Don't pay too close attention to our dragon go server ratings, rafial and I are close to the same level even though our AGA ratings are even further apart in the other direction. So far, the last several games he and I have played together, it seems that whichever one of us plays white loses.]

;B[oe];W[ld]C[xedover: too soon for this invasion? maybe its not needed?

Too late, but it is well-placed. The drawback is that your stones on the left are getting a bit thin.]
;B[nd]C[Should have been at O17.];W[je]C[Good, you're creating a lot of central influence.]
;B[eg]
(;W[lp]C[xedover: I was hoping to fake an invasion to soon create a ladder break for black's cutting stone at e13

As you realized, it only invited another ladder breaker from black. I think you should have started a fight with F13: you have support on the right from K15, and a corner enclosure below. This way you can make territory on the left and build a good position in the middle.]
;B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[no];B[jm]C[xedover: my opponent sees right through me and creates his own ladder break

And it will help him when he wants to cut through at N5.]

;B[hb];W[jb];B[ie];W[if];B[hf];W[he]C[xedover: I didn't read this out correctly. I was hoping to connect to my f14 group (or create another ladder breaker)

I think this works out fine, it's a good sacrifice to link up with the left. Black is spending a lot of stones on that corner, far too many for its size.]
;B[hd];W[hg];B[gf];W[gg];B[ge];W[jg]C[xedover:  I should have played f13.  I don't think it was necessary for my to protect the k14/j13 cuts

F13 or E12 would have given you an impressive wall, although with K7 already there, it's already weakened a bit.]
;B[fg];W[fh]C[xedover: this was probably a bad move, but black was kind later.]
;B[fe]C[xedover: I think black should have come out at e12 instead of taking my two stones yet]
;W[eh];B[gh]
(;W[hh]C[xedover: humm... wasted move? I see now the cut at N5 was more important. Any other big moves I should have seen?

That black stone is all alone, cutting two strong groups. There is no need to chase it into your framework. When attacking, it's seldom good to play too close to your opponent: you do that when you want to escape. You could consider something like D7, staking out a big framework, or (better, I think) K5, which defends against the cut and attacks on a grand scale.]
;B[mo];W[op];B[nq];W[lo]C[This is not good: that black stone has a lot of space to run into, your group on the right has weaknesses, and K7 is bound to get in your way. N6 would have been better.]

C[xedover: I still have my eye on killing black's k7 group, and soon lose sight of saving my own weakening groups

This is the right move though: black's centre group is not alive as long as he hasn't killed your right corner group, and it's crucial to keep D8 isolated. Your right corner group still has the ko as a life line, although it's very unfavorable.]

xedover: too many mistakes. I didn't think I could catch up now, so I resigned.

The main reason why you lost, apart from the mistakes you made, is that you didn't use the influence you built up on the top and right. You didn't turn it into territory, or use it to attack black. The fact that you had black's top left corner completely surrounded should have been enough to give you victory.]
