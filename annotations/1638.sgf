C[This is a game I (rstubble) played on IGS the other day.  I'd like to see 
what big plays get missed in the middle of the game.  I think I'm aware of most 
of the bad moves I made, some of which I just wanted to see play out, but I'm 
less aware of the good moves I didn't play.

Thanks

SC:  I will put my initials in front of my comments like this. Overall, black started out well.  Black failed to invade white's areas early in the middle game.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq]C[SC: this is a good start for black.  Black has stones spread out fairly well on both the third and fourth lines.]
;W[jd];B[cg]SQ[cf]C[SC:  the ususal approach move here would be at C14, but this move isn't bad.]
;W[cl]SQ[cg];B[cj]SQ[cl]C[SC:  Good, this makes a good base for black's stones.  The fact that black has room to do this shows how white's last move was too far away to be a good pincer.  Now white's stone needs to make a base or flee into the center.]
;W[co];B[cp]C[SC:  Good.  This move helps secure the lower left corner while also putting pressure on white's weak left side group.  Always look for moves that do more than one job at a time.]
;W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[fo];W[fn];B[go]C[SC:  Good.  Black doesn't want to leave cutting points behind. Besides,  each of black's moves is helping make lots of territory on the lower side.  Meanwhile, white's moves help strengthen this group, but it is unlikely to actually gain much territory.]
;W[gn];B[ho]C[that was maybe one too many, but I didn't mind getting pushed along the 5th 
line...

SC:  Pushing along the fifth line is fine.];W[pj]SQ[nc][mc]
[fc][gc][qg][qf]C[SC:  After 20 moves, black has more secure territory while white has more potential territory sketched out.  Neither of the two small left side groups is in danger currently.  Thus, it looks like time for black to invade white's potential territory before it becomes secure.  The spaces marked with squares are all possible choices for black invasions.]
;B[qm]C[SC: this is too small.  This is black's first bad move.  If black allows white a chance to secure the area sketched out on the top and right sides, black will lose.
     This move suggests that black is hesitant to invade.  An invasion is little risk to black.  If black doesn't invade, white gets the top side automatically.  If black does invade but dies, the white still gets the same area on the top side.  So, no loss for black if the invasion fails.  If black invades and lives, then white loses a large area of potential territory.
     The only time this logic doesn't apply is when black already has a weak group on the board.  An invasion is automatically a weak group that needs your full attention to defend.  If you already have a weak group, then don't invade and create a second weak group.]
;W[ek]C[SC:  White ignores black's last move and starts to attack black's side group while strengthening white's own side group.]

(;B[fg]C[SC:  This attempts to run out into the center.  There aren't any black stones to run towards, however, so this is less useful. I prefer pushing against white's lower left side group to strengthen black's group.  See the two variations for some ideas.  Black could also ignore this move and invade the top or upper right side.  Black should have time to come back and defend this group later.]
;W[pm];B[pn]C[SC:  Again, invade.  If black passively secures just the lower side and leaves the rest for white, black loses.]
;W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[nn]C[or pushing from behind on the 6th...

SC:  This does make a lot of territory.  But...an invasion is still better.]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[mm];B[ko];W[jn]C[seems to me that playing k5 on any of the next, oh 50 moves would have 
saved me some points.

SC:  True, but this would be an endgame type move.  So it is OK to wait about 50 moves to play it.]
;B[qj]C[SC:  This is a little better.];W[qi];B[pi]C[I was pretty sure Q11 was going to lead to something messy, 
but I wanted to see it play out.  didn't like how it ended up at all.

SC:  "Messy" can be fine.  Just realize that a cross-cut generally means that you get one side and your opponent the other.  If you try for both sides you generally lose both.  Also, your opponent gets to pick a side first.  Thus, only cross-cut if you would be happy with either side.
     In this case, the  area turned out badly for black largely because black never finished the ko fight that was started here.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[rj];B[oj]C[SC:  So, white chose to take a low position on the side leaving black with outside influence.]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[ql];B[qj]C[SC:  Now there is a ko fight.  If black wins by connecting, his stones are secure for the moment and white has a weak group on the right side.  If white connects, then black's stones are essentially dead.]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[pj];B[cd]C[SC:  This is a decent ko threat.  I would prefer a 3x3 point invasion at C17 in this case.  Making life for a 3x3 point invasion takes several moves.  Each move can be a ko threat since white will probably want to contain black in the corner.]
;W[ce];B[cc]C[SC:  Now black ignores the ko leaving his stones there in trouble.]
;W[dc];B[be];W[bf];B[cf];W[de];B[ad];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[ig]
TR[bg]SQ[qj]C[SC:  All of this started as a ko fight.  Now would be a good time to take the ko.  This move doesn't accomplish much.  It doesn't make territory.  It doesn't reduce white.  If you want to strengthen the left side group, the atari at B13.  If you want to strengthen the stones on the right side, the capture the ko at R10.]
;W[kg]
(;B[ij]TR[ai][bi][bh][ah]SQ[fi]C[SC:  Don't plan on making much territory at all around the square. Center territory is very hard to secure since you have to wall off 4 sides.  Corner and side territory only require walling off only 2 and 3 sides respectively.  In this circumstance, white can push up from E9 and reduce this area to essentially nothing. If you jump ahead to the end of the game, the only territory black gets here is around the triangles.  The entire area around the square ends up worth nothing.
     Black still  needs to invade the upper right corner.  See the variation for sample invasions.]
;W[kj];B[il]C[SC:  Black appears to be trying to cut off white's left side group.  That group should be able to live by itself, so cutting it off doesn't hurt white.]
;W[hn];B[kl]C[SC:  Don't both cutting apart two strong groups.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[kn];B[ln];W[lm];B[lo]SQ[ij]C[SC:  Is white have any less territory or any weaker groups than when black played the marked stone?  Does black have any more territory?  I don't think so in either case.  Thus, black's last several moves haven't accomplished much at all.]
;W[io];B[im]SQ[ip]C[SC:  Defending at J4 saves more territory.  This peep just forces White to connect where he would want to anyway.  Try to avoid forcing your opponent to do what he wants to do anyway.]
;W[in];B[hp]C[I can't really explain this move.  it's just slack.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[hq];B[gq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[kp];B[lq]
;W[rn];B[rl];W[rk];B[ro];W[sl];B[qo];W[sm];B[kf]C[This was not a good move.

SC:  This is sort of an invasion.  If it was one square to the left it would be a reducing move.  This is just barely an invasion. For invasions, however, barely is not good.  This stone will be cut off from the rest of black's stones and will have to make life.  It is much easier to make life in the corner or along the side.  So, if you are finally going to invade, jump in deeply and work towards making life right away.]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[je];B[jg];W[lg]SQ[ke][kf]C[SC:  The invaders are cut off as predicted.  They have nothing resembling eye space yet.]
;B[nc]SQ[ke][kf]C[SC:  This is better.  Black should plan to sacrifice the marked stones.  Trying to save them will distract from making eyes in the corner.]
;W[ld];B[kc]C[SC:  This is good use of the two dead stones as a sacrifice to force white to play where you want.  Without them, white would probably play at M17 to seperate black's stones.]
;W[kd];B[qc];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[qd]SQ[kc][nc][ke]
[kf]C[SC:  Black will probably have to sacrifice all of the marked stones and focus on making life for the stones in the upper right corner.  When invading, be quick to sacrifice even half of your stones if you can save the rest in the process.]

C[SC:  Now we finally get back to the ko.];W[bc];B[bd];W[pj]
;B[ph]SQ[gd][bn]C[SC:  This is not a ko threat.  Black still has some decent threats. I think white would respond to a black play at either square.]
;W[nj]C[SC:  White wins the ko];B[oh];W[nh];B[he]SQ[re][rh]
C[SC:  This is a good reducing move.  Securing the upper right corner is more important now, however.  S12  would be good now. S15 is not a bad alternative.]
;W[rh]C[SC:  Now black is short of Liberties.];B[qf];W[hc];B[ic]
C[SC:  Black should secure the upper right corner by capturing at S15]

C[SC:  These stones are not  going to survive.  
Save the upper right corner.];W[od];B[lc];W[jc];B[me];W[md]
;B[nd];W[mc]C[this move kills that black group.  I don't know 
exactly where I thought I was going to get that other eye...

SC:  I would say this group has been dead for a few moves.]
;B[ne]C[SC:  This move doesn't help save any dead stones.  It is a forcing move, so White will have to respond.  It should be saved to use as a ko threat later.]

moves ago.  letting it get into ko-life was very very sloppy.]
