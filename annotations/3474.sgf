AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I played this game at 2 stones. This guy used to just be unable to beat me evenly (he's in the local go club) but now he can beat me easily at two stones - and I really don't know what I'm doing wrong... it's very confusing, especially since I always think I'm winning till the very last moment =P

I need help !

So, thanks for taking the time to give me a review, I've asked a few questions along the way, but if you see anything that looks strange, do tell me ^^

Again, Many thanks,

-Jon (LithiumTwo)


pto: I am not much stronger than you so you should consider this as peer review. My ideas are based on my own style and might be utterly wrong for some others, but that should not prevent you from learning from me. I hope I can help you.]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[oq];B[po];W[mp];B[ql]TR[qk]C[could I have gone at triangle? I was just worried about R7 move if I did that.

pto: There is no yes or no for that and I don't intend to show you ton of variations about what might happen. Study it on your own and check what kind of results you can get from it.  I'd say play it and try it for some time and then decide.]
;W[fq]
(;B[cm]C[pto: I always say that this is a bad stone. Play C6 instead This leaves a lot bigger opening in the corner and it does not do much more on the side. I like to get over with things and C6 would be a lot more solid for future: now you need to fix it later somehow.]
;W[dr];B[cf];W[ch];B[cj];W[di];B[cq];W[cr];B[ef]C[is it okay to leave the bottom left group as is?

pto: It is dangerous at least. There are several weak points that need to be fixed at some point. But I think black can handle every white attack but he has to resort to full defence.]
;W[fd];B[eh];W[ck]C[pto: This shows flexibility from white but I would prefer running out.]
;B[dj];W[cl];B[dm];W[bj];B[bi];W[dk];B[ej];W[ek];B[ei];W[bp]
C[pto: I think this misses the vital point at C5.];B[bq];W[br]
;B[aq];W[bn];B[bm];W[bl];B[am];W[eo];B[do];W[en];B[em]C[pto: Only this separates this result from being disaster for black. The worst possible outcome would be being sealed in. It would propably lead to early resignation if white build huge territory on the lower side.]
;W[co];B[fm];W[dn]C[pto: Lets consider some alternatices for a second.

What happens after H17? Or how about daring attack at E17? Hmm. that may be a bit too much.  Would capturing white around B9 be bigger than losing the corner? Lets see, B F9, W C6. Black has sente? Then H17 to make huge framework on the upper right corner. I don't know, I am not a pro after all.]
;B[cn];W[ep];B[ap]C[pto: Was this necessary?];W[dq];B[cp];W[fk]
;B[hm]C[pto: I would try to lean on that weak white group a bit more, with G8 or H8 perhaps.]
;W[bo];B[ao];W[hk];B[hp]C[I kind of wanted to attack the bottom right group... so I thought if he kept attacking me I might build up some kind a thickness to attack it with... but never happened.

is there some way I could have gotten an attack ont the bottom right into this game?

pto: I spot a flaw in your mindset here: "if he kept attacking me I might...". How about replacing it with this: "if I kept attacking him I might...". White has a weak group in middle. Attacking it defends the heavy black group and builds thickness towards your intented target.

I don't think that attacking the bottom right is interesting. Because white is strong at bottom left there is no splitter attack and white can easily live by going to corner or extending along the side. To enable serious attack toward bottom right, moves 1-50 should be played differently so that also white group at bottom left would be in danger.

I think that black primary objective around here should be to prevent white from making territory by keeping invasion points open. Upper left corner looks a lot more interesting for black. There black could build territory while attacking. H17 or more modest O17 perhaps.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[in];W[fn];B[jn];W[il];B[im];W[jp];B[gj]
C[with this move I wanted to keep white weak and heavy - but this doesn't seam to do any damage... is there a move I should have used to make white weak and heavy?...

pto: White is heavy. His group can get one eye in gote. Losing this group would decide the game. If that is not heavy then what is?

But how to proceed? Attacking this group will make it alive - you canot capture groups like this. And black has heavy group too that makes capturing certainly impossible.

My plan: attack from right and build influence toward upper and right sides (and try not to lose your heavy group).  This weak group forces white to defend and on the moment that is is alive enough attack all out agains upper left corner and force it to crawl to live. Then you should have huge moyo on the right and all you need to do is to make more territory from it than what white gest from lower side.

If things go well  white gets one barely living group at middle and one small corner. Black has huge moyo. Instead of defending the moyo black  connects H4 and makes one eye while destroying white territory. White invades the moyo and black wins the game after vigorous defence.]
;W[gk];B[jk]C[pto: This is like shooting you own foot. Black attacks directly and ends up not attacking at all.]
;W[jl]C[Kind of gave up making white weak and heavy - didn't think I still had a chance of it...

pto: Like said, white is already heavy. I can see the huge black moyo on the upper right corner. Think it, who has advantage in upper right corner?

I tried to make a bit of an invasion as I needed a second eye and didn't want to be pushed to my group on the left...

pto: Attack the upper left corner first and try to get out from it with sente. Then invade bottom.

What was wrong with my play that got me into this position?

pto: Black group around D12 is fairly strong so black could have pushed white weak group around C9 agains it. Then this weak black group would have become central influence that would face black framework at right. Black would then have options to attack upper left corner or invade lower side. And attack agains upper corner is likely to end with sente, he might be able to do both.]
;B[ip];W[ko];B[jq];W[kq];B[jr];W[hr];B[ir];W[kn]C[pto: In situations like this I consider living inferior to running. Group that makes eyes canot attack anyone, but groups that run for their lives are sometimes fatal for their opponent.

If black had got L6 he might later be able to attack either one of weak white groups. Keep your opponent weak, cherish his weaknesses (without attacking them) until he will crumble or defend. And when he has defended one weakness go all out agains the other one you have been cherishing.]
;B[gr];W[gq];B[hq];W[fr];B[hs];W[qf]C[pto: This corner is almost empty as both have been busy in opposite corner. But that makes this corner so huge. But white has so many weak groups now that going here is fairly dangerous. If black manages to foce white live on the side and build outside influence the heavy white group is in imminent danger.

I think that both white and black have underestimated the importance of this corner.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj]C[pto: White entrance here was simple and efficient and beautifull. It promises future possibilities around R6 and R 17.]
;B[kl]C[pto: Cutting these groups is difficult and I think L7 would be better start because it has one liberty more and it can connect to a living group. White group on the right might make this cut impossible.]
;W[kk];B[km];W[jj];B[pq];W[lc];B[mr];W[qc]C[pto: These stones were furikawari.  Black has lost all his potential in upper side and white has lost his group at lower side. Now black has to crawl to life which propably ends with white having sente and then he can bring his lower group out. So not good for black I think. And black attack at H17 is losing it's best edge.]
;B[pc];W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb];W[ob];B[nc]C[attempting to make strongish shape, is there a better shape move? or should I just run for it?

pto: Black is heavy and without eyes.  It is time to run for your life (and try to kill the heavy white group while doing it).

... or should I be attacking the bottom (L6 and that lot)?

pto: Something arounf N6 surely kills white there. Then white tries to rescue that group by attacking L7 group from outside and build more influence towards upper side. And then at correct moment white throws stone to N13 or something like that. Splash.

That might be intersting and fierce fight for rest of the game. But white would have upper hand there so I don't think that is good alternative for black.]
;W[nb];B[nf];W[mm];B[no];W[mo];B[np];W[pb]C[pto: Think about the result in upper right corner. It was black corner which has now become a heavy group without eyes. What kind of exchange can justify this result?

And what else has happened? White captured K9 making his heavy group almost alive, and the white group at lower right corner is almost in fine shape. Here black has lost the game.

I think black was too concentrated on lower side and lower right corner. You said in your comments that you wanted to attack the on group, and you sure did that. Only the weak black group at upper side prevents you from capturing the white.

But for what price? After lower left corner was settled in tie it was upper right corner that would decide the game. White won there 10-0.]
;B[nn];W[lm];B[mn];W[jm]C[pto: Worst possible result. Two weak white groups connect and live togather. White is also building influence that will crumble black in upper right corner.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[qh];W[rg];B[ok];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[og]
;B[qi];W[le];B[mf];W[lf];B[mh];W[id]C[pto: H17, the attack that would have been corner of my whole strategy, has lost its meaning. At this point I might play E17 just because I was pissed about losing H17. But then again, I resign a lot.]
;B[bd];W[cc]C[pto: This exchange server only to make your group alive. If you want to hurt your opponent invaede at 3-3 or do something more drastic.]
;B[ij]C[This move was an attempt at outlining some territory around H13... I got about 3 points in there in the end... should I have spent my time doing something else?... is it just sufficient to erase white's territory-making potential in this area - or is it okay to try for territory (in which case - what'd I do wrong?)

.. gee, that was a mouthful

pto: What is open from two sides will not become into territory. And this are is open from three sides. I don't think there is more than yose left. But white G14 would be annoying so that might justify playing there.]
;W[ik]C[at this point it looks kina impossible to invade... the potential for it seamed to just disappear without my noticing... which move should I have used to invade with?? (top)

Thanks for the review,

see you around

pto: This game was not decided more by attitude than by skill. White was more flexible and arrogant. He made several strategical attacks quietly and gracefully. Black stones didn't have the innovative and experimental flow. Black seemed to play only in the lower right corner.

White and black are in skill except in yose where white was stronger.

So what to do differently? 1) keep your groups solid, strong and preferable few, 2) with every stone try to find and make your opponent weaker and 3) be flexible and arrogant and bold.  Experiment and don't fear defeat.

The first step from becoming stronger than another is that you can see his weakness. Do it and you will win. And never, ever give anything without a fight like you did in upper right corner. If you want to win this guy again study his games so long that you can tell what is his weakness. You will become stronger while doing it. And this is actually one of the best ways to get stronger: choose a nemesis and work to win her.

Happy hunting,
pto])
