C[I was black in this game.  I was doing fairly well and think i may have even had a lead at some point, but i made some mistakes and ended up losing by 1.5 moku.  I'd appreciate any general advice.  I feel like a lot of my moves were too slow, and then there were a few that were just
genuinely bad ;)  Thanks!


game commentary by kicker(4k). Parts of analysis where done in an online session with wonkie on KGS]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[kicker> Very good. I like to play the low chinese fuseki as well :-)]
;W[dj];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[fq]C[kicker> until now the game could have been played by dan players. but whites next two moves are a little bit slack]
;W[eq]LB[dn:A]C[kicker [4k\]: this helps black. better at A]
;B[fp];W[dm]LB[dn:A]C[kicker> and this jump is one row too far. there is no need for B too exploit the weaknesses here right now (because W will not spend another move here)
but W14 leaves a lot of aji for the future]
(;B[po]C[kicker> this is not a bad move at all. but a move around tengen would be more in the spirit of chinese fuseki. the idea of the chinese opening is: let opponent invade and gain from attack.

wonkie [13k\]: i see.  but are you saying that this sequence should wait until later?
kicker [4k\]: yes
kicker [4k\]: because w will not play in this area in the next couple of moves
wonkie [13k\]: ok, i understand
kicker [4k\]: Q5 is not a bad move
kicker [4k\]: but in chinese fuseki you often wait with this shimari
kicker [4k\]: and play big mojo game instead];W[mq]
(;B[kq]LB[lo:A]C[is there a stronger response to the invasion?  I was trying to take away his base and strengthen my group to the left at the same time

kicker> i would like to play at A instead.  the idea is: let w live small and seal him in. b will get huge thickness in exchange and the b stones in the bottom would become much more effective as in the game
wonkie [13k\]: yeah that makes a lot of sense.  my only problem is profiting from the attack, seem to have trouble with that sometimes :)
wonkie [13k\]: i'm always reluctant to force them into my potential territory, but i assume the idea here is to seal him in and build a powerful wall?
kicker [4k\]: with L3 you force W to run into the center
kicker [4k\]: as the result your bottom groups gets isolated
wonkie [13k\]: my plan was to enlarge my framework on the right side by attacking his weak group (which ended up working out okay)
kicker [4k\]: thats why i think that a move at A is better
kicker [4k\]: right side worked ok
wonkie [13k\]: yeah i understand.  i'm still too reluctant to give up potential territory, something that i need to work on
kicker [4k\]: but at the end bottom group became very weak]
;W[mo]TR[fp][jp][fq][kq]C[kicker [4k\]: because the shape of this stones is not very good
wonkie [13k\]: i think i was assuming that my left group was already strong enough, but i see that it's not
kicker [4k\]: also you want wo exploit the weakness around D5 soon
kicker [4k\]: and this is much easier with a strong bottom group
wonkie [13k\]: yes, definitely]
(;B[nn]C[trying to enlarge my right side, possibly too greedy?

kicker> i still like to develop the bottom group];W[mn];B[nm]
;W[mm]
(;B[nl];W[or];B[pr];W[oq]C[kicker [4k\]: maybe time to tenuki here

wonkie [13k\]: yeah, i guess i didn't really need to respond to that]

(;B[op];W[np];B[no]C[kicker [4k\]: he got sente
kicker [4k\]: thats the problem
kicker [4k\]: sente is very important
kicker [4k\]: w should have played elsewhere now];W[lp]C[We both make good shape in the bottom, and i take a big area
kicker [4k\]: M4 is way too slow
kicker [4k\]: chicken move:)
wonkie [13k\]: :)
kicker [4k\]: maybe now right time for D5];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[bc]C[I think this is a deviation from the joseki.  What's the best way to punish this?]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[ed]C[kicker [4k\]: your question was how to get profit from whites unusual move
kicker [4k\]: i think your profit here is, that you didnt get sealed in like in normal joseki]
;W[dg];B[oc];W[qh]C[kicker [4k\]: this should not work
kicker [4k\]: too deep
kicker [4k\]: you must attack right now]
(;B[qg]C[wonkie [13k\]: yeah, one of my biggest problems right now, giving up territory to take a bigger profit]
;W[ph]
(;B[oj]C[kicker [4k\]: also too submissive
kicker [4k\]: protects maybe 4-6 points of territory
kicker [4k\]: and puts no pressure on w

(;B[bm]C[mistake on my part.  is the variation the correct way to play?
kicker [4k\]: this was what you played
wonkie [13k\]: yeah, which seems to be a mistake
kicker [4k\]: i dont really know if w could have killed you
kicker [4k\]: but lets look at variation you gave];W[bp];B[an]
;W[bq];B[ck]C[Trying
to make some eyes, but i feel like this isn't a very good move.    iended up making life anyway, but only because my opponent missed an
opportunity to kill.  What's a better way to make 2 eyes here?]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bi]
(;B[bk]C[I probably could've lived unconditionally with the variation.
kicker [4k\]: B9 was clear mistake as you already found out]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[aj]C[I was very relieved when he played here :)  A8 is what i was afraid of]
;B[al];W[ai];B[ak];W[qp]C[kicker [4k\]: this should not work]
;B[pp];W[qr]
(;B[qq]C[Here i decided to let him take some of my territory because i was afraid if i decended to q1 and cut him off, he'd be able to make a living group.  should i have been afraid?]
;W[ps];B[rr]C[kicker> this move is very small. wshould have ignored it]
;W[qs];B[rs]C[kicker [4k\]: last 2 moves were small];W[os]C[wonkie [13k\]: yeah i see that now... again me being a chicken!
kicker [4k\]: :)];B[rp]C[kicker [4k\]: but this is -1 in gote
kicker [4k\]: = worst move in game];W[od];B[fr]C[kicker [4k\]: good
kicker [4k\]: you remembered the weakness of this group]
