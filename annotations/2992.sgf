AB[pd][dp]C[For the reviewer:
This game played a few days ago and this was a league match.
Thank you very much,
Utku.

Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen. I'm EGF 5 kyu from Finland.

Overall few comments about the game.

In the beginning you gave white large moyo and influence too easily. In general, where is the correct direction to play. Also if you start rescue some stones you should consider is this necessary? It is not okay to run towards to your own moyo because white is coming there too. In otherwords, sacrifying stones when they have served their purpose. I added some comments and variations for both players. Hope they help.]

[dk:E][cl:B][dl:C][fp:A]C[JT: At this point the sequence played helped white a lot. See the comment in the next move. Black must do something with to prevent the two wing formation.]

(;B[co]C[JT: This corner sequence is good in many cases but now it is wrong when thinking the whole board situation. White is only too happy when playing like this. White gets strong wall towards the upper left corner and forms moyo.]

[op]C[I think the right side is clearly open 'cause of H6.

JT: Black has a lot of potential in the right side but like you said there is plenty of open places. Atleast those marked places are open for invasion. 

The H6 is a big point for both. If white takes it, black makes 5th line area at the bottom, and white strengthens it wall which makes the reduction of whites moyo even harder.

The E17 move is also urgent.]
(;W[gc]C[JT: Good move from white. Black stone is now under attack and white is strong on both sides.]

(;B[ee]C[JT: This is ok.

I give some Joseki continuations, see the variations.]
(;W[cf]C[JT: Here white can play the marked stone one line higher into D14. Because if black has to run out white can un along in fourth line and making nice territory. 

(See the Joseki variations from move 26.)]
(;B[fb]C[What sould I play instead of F18?

JT: This move is somewhat weird. It does not do pretty much anything. Black can secure some base by sliding into the corner ie. by playing C18 instead. But then black is closed into the corner and white makes profit.]

JT: not much harm. Black has nice area on the upper right corner. And the corner group is in no danger. See the variations.]

JT: At this point black has still a quite good position, though the effect of the 2 handicap stones is prety much gone. However after this stone it seems that black was too eager to save these two marked stones. (It is just a two stones...)

Trying to connect these stones to the lower left corner, is not easy and it has more harm to black than helps him.]

Some reducing points for white D,G,F. E is more like an invasion.]
