C[Andrew:
Recently had this game at the MSN zone GO room.  I'm black and
play at about 5k-7k most of the time, though have played higher.
 White reported himself to be at about 2k.    Basically I felt the game went okay through the opening, but
wnet quickly down hill from there.  I would like to know where
some of the big errors were and also just some info on how those
position could have been improved.]
(;B[dp];W[pc];B[dd];W[oq];B[pe]C[Unobjectionable, though against a stronger player you might consider d10 or r15.]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[qd];B[pg];W[nc];B[po]C[Big mistake here not to complete the joseki in the upper corner.  As W now, I will pincer and separate B into two groups - with w just having one group with lots of space.  A play around r9 or even r10 would be joseki, I believe.  You should look it up.  I should know it, but I'm poor at remembering exact placement - I just know it should be finished here.  Even a play at r7 or r8 makes b more solid and w have less wonderful moves than the coming pincer.]
;W[qm]C[Yep. There it is. Low is right here, though high is playable.  B should now look to use his upper stones and his stones on the left by counterpincering 12 or by capping it immediately.  5k players tend to slide into the corner here though - something I'm sure w expects.]
;B[qq]C[Yep.  There it is.];W[qh]C[Now b loses his base and w is safe everywhere.  W can target two b groups; b only one w stone.]
;B[rf];W[ph];B[oh]C[I would move out with 17 here.  Any contact play will just make w strong.  so a move around n 15 or even n14 looks about right.]
;W[oi];B[nh]C[Notice the effect on the b corner group and the w stone on the bottom - devastating.  Not that b is killable - yet - but that w gets such a wonderful attack while gaining points.]
;W[ni];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh];W[kj]C[24 forstalls b m11 and looks to preventing b from building anything in the center and much on the left side and helps the lower w stone.  W alternatives would be something on the left side or lower side.  Notice how w's wall faces an area where something can be done while b's wall faces a nearby white stronghold - the upper corner group.  Which has more influence in the game?]
;B[pm]C[Go proverb:  play away from strength.  You are playing right toward the teeth of the w dragon.  W will not respond passively here - w is too strong.  So you will strengthen this q stone, weaken yourself, and either build a tiny, sealed-in group in the corner or  have a group running in the midst of w who will build territory on the bottom and influence in the middle.

Let's see.];W[qn];B[pn];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[li];W[lj];B[mj]
C[Ouch.  W will ignore this cut.  The two w stones are strong enough to fend for themselves and the side group is alive.  So w now wants to help out the lower stone to keep the pressure on the b running group.  Stronger players would do this indirectly inviting b to use his big wall to eat the w stone small - and so would be likely to approach the lower left corner first, then  pull back toward the w stone - remember the proverb - play away from strength - and approach strength slowly.  So w should play around g3 or even h3 to avoid a pincer.  B responds in the corner and w does a two point jump toward his deeply shadowed stone.  But at 2k, w probably plays around m3.]
;W[lq]C[Yep.

Now what should b do?  Any play around those two stones makes them strong and weakens the b group.

I like c10 - for territory potential on the left side - d10 for fighting more in the middle.  Though a bit curious, something biased toward the top along the left looking to then play on the top works with the b strength.  Very hard to find the best move here- other than don't attack the lower w stones directly.]
;B[jq]C[W will one-point jump, helping his two stones on the lower side and the two stones in the middle and weakening the b group and the attacking stone on h3.    35 is a very, very, very weak move in this situation.]
;W[lo];B[jo];W[lm];B[jm]C[Now w will attack the b group, settle his own group, leave with sente, and make a move to keep the last three b moves from becoming too valuable.  Let's see.]
;W[nm];B[om];W[pr];B[qr];W[rp];B[qo];W[ro];B[pq];W[or];B[rq]
;W[no];B[oj];W[pi];B[pj];W[nj];B[ok];W[qj];B[qk];W[ql];B[rk]
;W[rl];B[rj];W[qi];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl];W[ml];B[ri];W[rh];B[sh]
;W[sg];B[sl];W[sm];B[rn];W[sk];B[sn];W[so];B[qp];W[rm];B[op]
;W[np];B[oo];W[jh]C[So w settles both sides, and leaves with sente and now plays a most interesting move.

Can B afford to ignore it and play something around d7 or d10?  I think so if b is confident in fighting and is willing to cut off a stone or two.  But safer would be to play around o15, n15 or m15 - making a simple, resilient box.]
;B[jg]C[This will do what - strengthen w.  What direction - toward the left side and bottom.  Where did b have potential to do something?  Left side and bottom.

W should run on 12 as long as b will push him.    Let's see.]
;W[ig]C[Oops.  A mistake by w.  B should descend to k 14 - thus w helps b create the box b wants anyway - and w also leaves a cutting point behind.]
;B[ki]C[Ugly - empty triangle at L12.  And the cut doesn't work.  This makes w 84 into a good move.]
;W[ji];B[jj];W[jf]C[See?];B[jk]C[Now the b group can be attacked - notice that the very reason to play the stone on k13 was to help the b group on the upper right - and that whole point is now gone.

BTW, notice how none of this happens if you finished the joseki rather than approach the bottom in the first place in the opening.  This cascade of events is why it is joseki to play around r10 early on.]
;W[lk];B[kg];W[hh];B[dj]C[93 is good - except that having given w the wall from J12 to k14, w can begin to compete for territory now.]
;W[fc]C[  Yep.  There it is.];B[id]C[Hmmm.  Settle your group first.  Shoulder hit at n16 looks right.]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[me]C[Trading one weak group for another is not a way to win at go.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[mf];W[lc];B[lf];W[fe];B[df];W[fg];B[dh]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[gc];B[dc]C[And indeed you lost a weak group at last.

Now it is easy for w.  Just  live inside  your framework at the bottom and reduce it a bit - and the w upper side should be enough.

The 3-3 invasion looks good - followed by reduction of the center territory.  Or something along the left side to see what happens.

By the way, count the points.  W has about 60. 65 is often enough to win.  B has 30 upper left and 20-30 in the lower left corner.  So B is still in it, though less secure territory at this point than w.  This particular power in the lower left quadrant is why w 34 should not have been played so close to b strenghth.]
;W[cm];B[dm]C[You can't kill w here.  do  you want points top, bottom, middle or where?

19 is about the worst move of the options open to you.  I like c5 - almost takes the corner and squeezes w.  I would chase w out to the w upper group - taking points below and to the left all the way.  Now you are in for a fight for the game.  If you can get 40 points in the middle and side and 30 in the upper left, it will be close.]
;W[cn]C[Hmm. not the best for w I think.  to heavy.];B[dn];W[bp]

;B[jl];W[bl];B[ak]C[Notice how w has lived on the side and taken away b's middle, and split the corner.  This is not a good result for b.  And w isn't done yet.  Better for b to have chased w out to his w group.]

;W[hm];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[hp];B[go];W[ho]C[W is alive and threatening the b wall that was to have been so valuable - and has taken away points on the bottom.

All you had to do was use your strength to harass and chase w and that would have been enough - or at least a countable game.]
;B[gq];W[cp];B[dq];W[bn];B[an]C[Alive with seki - and the push at k6 still makes in not only unconditionally alive, but threatens to make two weak b groups.]

;W[ko];B[kq];W[kr];B[gr]C[Now count the points.  Game over.  B gets 35 in the upper left and 12 in the lower quadrant - fewer than w who was outnumbered about 7-1 when w invaded.

Two biggest errors by b - not finishing the joseki and not playing just to limit w in the lower left quadrant at the end of the game.]
