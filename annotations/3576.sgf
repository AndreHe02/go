Hello salvor, I will do my best to review your game.  Since I am not much stronger than white, you will need to take my comments with a grain of salt, especially when relating to white's moves]
PL[W];W[pq]C[I feel one of my biggest difficulties presently is the opening.  If you could examine this opening, and recommend some specific and/or general mistakes I could address, that would be great.]
;B[de]C[--
taking the third corner is certainly standard, though C16 is more common than D15]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[--
O15 or O16 seem at least as good here. 

It feels like you are trying to complicate the game when you are already 25 points ahead.  Why not play textbook go for a while, and wait for white to complicate the game?]

(;B[qo];W[qp];B[po];W[np];B[pk]C[Was this too small?  Looking at it now, it seems like too many stones bunched on the right hand side.  Does R5 need the protection?

This seems wrong, as soon as white supports F3, black will be left with two week groups.  It is better to simply help D4 with C/D 6]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do]C[When should this continuation be used over C5?  Was this correct here?

this is correct, otherwise white can punish.];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]
;B[eq];W[cn];B[fp]C[This was very small I think now.  Was this required?]
;W[cc]C[--
white varies slightly from standard joseki which is to approach the upper left corner from the other side because white oes not want to approach the 5-4 point from the 7-3 point.

Black can take advantage of this by taking sente and approaching C6]

;B[ld]C[--
this is a good result except that it does not punish C6, but that is a minor matter.  I would have played M16 at M17 myself to put more pressure on white.]
;W[jd]
(;B[ne]C[--
I dislike this move, it allows white to connect and destroy black's moyo, while only building a small moyo.

In many ways I think this move was the turning point in the game]
;W[jf];B[jh];W[lc]C[--
black lost a lot of points here, black's choice of joseki in the left is rendered useless, and black must take compensation on the right.

I think the game is close now, white may even be ahead already.]

this does not help];W[kd];B[le];W[lb];B[kf];W[jg];B[kg]C[Bad sequence for me I see.  Where did I go wrong around L17?

by permitting the connection you make it easy for white to fight]

;B[mq];W[nr];B[nq];W[op];C[Result: W+Resign
--
Overall, you lost the game through two very costly mistakes

The first was permitting white to destroy the upper moyo through permitting the connection.  It is essential to keep your opponent weak when they invade your moyo, so you cannot leave a gote connection for them.  The second was the misread in the complex fight on the right.

Both of these mistakes have the same theme: If you are going to play a moyo centered game then you have to respond slowly and extremely carefully whenever white invades that moyo, because the entire game rests on every move.

I hope this review helps]N[RESULT])
