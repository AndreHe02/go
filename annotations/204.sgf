C[Paavo (Olawi)): My opponent, neWay is someone with whom I am personally familiar with. He always seems to win our games by superior play in the opening. That is why I most often try to win them by starting a fight :) This game is an example of this, I made some inefficient moves in the opening and in the middle game started fighting too early against too strong groups.

Tim: Both players seem to make weak groups far to readily. You have to learn that if you have a weak group on the board then you have a problem. If you have two weak groups on the board then you deserve to loose the game.

Of course. to make these statements true, you have to learn what you can do when your opponent makes a weak group. Well, of course, what you do with weak groups is that you attack them! But the question is, what do you want in return for attacking the group?

Just to make is absolutely clear, you should NOT attack your oppont's group with the aim of capturing it. Almost all groups in go find some way to get that second eye. If you chase your oppoent's group all across the board whilst trying to capture it and then it lives then you probably end up with no territory.

Of course, sometimes you oppoent will do an unreasonable invasion and then you have to kill it to punish him, and at other times you are going to have to resign unless you capture one of the opponet's groups, but these are special cases.

So what should you try to do whilst attacking?

1) Well the best advice in in the proverb "make territory whilst attacking". You play attacking moves that also surround territory whilst your opponent has to make defensive moves that just surround 2 points.

2) A slightly more indirect plan is to make thickness whilst attacking. Then you can use that thickness to attack another of your opponent's groups or to invade his territory,

3) A third option is to chase the opponet's group into his own territory. This means that the opponent's weak group connects to some of his other stones and becomes strong, but if you have destroyed a lot of his territory in the process then you can be happy.

In fact this is a good general point: If you attack your opponents's group you will force him to play defensive moves. This is good because you keep sente like this. But because your opponet is playing defensive moves his group will eventually become strong. So the amount of attafcking you can do is limited. You have to make the most of your attacking chances.

One important part of making the most of your attacking chances lies in finding the right "direction of play". For example, if you can attack your opponent's group from either the left or the right, and you have a chance of making territory on the left but not on the right, then you should obviously attack from the left. When I say it like this it sounds easy. In a real game it is never that simple, and strong players spend a lot of time trying to work out the correct direction of play in middle game fights.

As a rule of thumb, if your opponent has a weak group on the board then you should expect about 10-20 points worth of profit from attacking it.

O.K. that is enough general comments. Let us look at how the weak groups in this game should be attacked.]
;B[qd];W[qp];B[dc];W[co];B[de];W[ic]C[This is a slightly strange move, but I suppose that it is possible.

One very classical bit of opening theory is that it is bad to let the opponent make two shimaris. White has given you the chance to make a second shimari here if you want it.]
;B[kc]C[Tim: However this is also a good move. It puts pressure on white. After this you can go back an make a shimari in the top corner.]
;W[oc]C[Olawi: I should be OK at the top, but which move would you suggest?

Tim: This looks like a mistake by white. It looks to me as if white should end up with two leak groups at the top. Black then gets a splitting attack and wins. Well that is the theory at any rate.]

(;B[md]C[This looks like the wrong side to attack from. Instead I would recommend ... (see variation).]
;W[qc]C[Tim: This is sensible play by white. White want's to make his group alive as quickly as possible here so he dives into the corner.]

(;B[od]C[Olawi: Is there a better reply? I figured that my thickness would be better than what white gets in the corner.

Tim: This is the right direction. You want to shut white into the corner and make him have to search for eyes whilst you build a nice wall.

However there may be a better move to achieve this.];W[pd]C[The problem is that this move gives black a lot of cutting points so black has to defend and ends in gote.]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[oe];W[fc];B[fe]LB[cj:A][pk:B]C[Olawi: Is this any good? Now it looks clumsy to me. Maybe 'A' or 'B'?

Tim: I think that this is quite a good attacking move. The two white stones are quite weak because black is strong on both sides. You would like to attack a bit to build a wall and then extend down the side. When you knwo exactly how strong your wall is you will know how far to extend.]
;W[he]C[This looks like the wrong shape to me. A one point jump, one space to the right, looks better.]

(;B[cj]C[Tim: This is a good move, but I think that you should go on attacking at the top a bit to see what happens.]
;W[dq]
(;B[iq]C[Again this is slightly strange. I think that you should play an approach move against the bottom right corner instead.]
;W[gq];B[oq]C[Olawi: I thought that there was no pincer that would hurt too much.

Tim: You're wrong. White plays in the middle, and you it is you who has two weak groups. You really ought to play a 2-space extension to make your group safe, then you have no worries annywhere on the board and can take the initiative.]
;W[lp];B[qm]C[Olawi: Is this over-aggressive? I still thought that I could avoid trouble at the bottom.

Tim: No, I think that is good provided you know what you are doing.

It is unreasonable for black to try to save both of the black stones at the bottom. However, as long as the contact move at M3 is available it looks like black can build some sort of live group in the bottom area.   So it is quite all right to treat the black stone near the corner lightly by playing this move to build up on the right side. This is good because black has the wall at the top to use to build a nice moyo on the right. If black can get this we don't care if white gets the corner in exchange.]
;W[op];B[pj]LB[pq:A]C[Olawi: Should white now play 'A'?

Tim: 'A' next is the honest move, but it is quite slow. I think I would play it myself, but I can understand white wanting to do something move aggressive.]
;W[re];B[qe];W[rd];B[rf];W[ni]C[Nice to see someone who know about reducing moves.]
;B[se];W[sc];B[qg]C[This is a very passive answer by black. There are much move interesting things to try.

The white group at the top is still weak, you could have a go at attacking it. Depending on what happens there, black might get stronger in the centre, and can then try to attack white's reducing move.

Also, white did not play a defensive move in the bottom right. Now is a chance to start a fight there. Again, the way that that fight develops might affect how you choose to answer white's reducing move.]
;W[pl];B[rb];W[rc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa]
(;B[ql]C[Again, this is very very passive. White's thickness in the centre is almost certainly going to be worth move than 10 extra points that black gets on the side.

First note that the black formations at the top left and the top right are both very strong. So the stones that you need to worry about are the three black stones near the bottom in white's area. You have to fing something worthwhile to do with these. I think that you choose to save the wrong one. A better idea is to start a fight in the corner.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[oj];B[pi];W[on];B[np];W[oo];B[lq];W[kq]
(;B[mq]C[This is a very heavy move. Look at it this way. Black two potential weak groups at the bottom. You started out with the stone at J3 and the stone at P3. It is natural to want to save one of these stones, however it is unreasonable  to expect to save both of them. If you do try to save both of them then your opponet should get a splitting attack and it will be a disaster.   So you are going to sacrifice one stone in order to save the other. This is the essence of light play. The secret is to not make up your mind as to which stone you are going to save until you have to. You want to try to confuse your opponent so that he does not know which stone you want to save. Then, when you see how the fight is developing, you can work out what to defend and what to sacrifice.

The problem with this move is that it makes it very clear that black is trying to save the stones near the corner, and after white connects, the black stone at J3 is pretty useless. If you are going to give up a stone then you want to make it costly for your opponent to capture it.

So what I am saying is that black should cross-cut. (see variation).]
;W[kp];B[pq];W[qq];B[pm];W[qr];B[nl];W[mn];B[kr];W[jr];B[lr]
;W[jq];B[nr];W[om]LB[cm:A]C[Olawi: At this point, I thought that I was doing well. Perhaps 'A', and I would be ahead?

Tim: Let's estimate the score after black 'A':

White:

Bottom left: 20 (assuming that the black stone at J3 is effectively captured)
Bottom right: 10
Top right: 10
Top edge: 5
Komi: 5

Total: 50

Black:

Bottom: 5
Right and top: 20
left side: ??

this is tricky because there is a big gap in the middle so it is not really territory. But if it all became territory then it would be about 25 points. That is a reasonable assumption because it would be dangerous for white to invide on thie left with the weak white group at the top.

Total 50

So it is a close game. There is also a question of what happens in the centre. It looks as if white has a better chance of making territory there becuase of his wall in the lower right, but on the other hand there is the weak white group at the top.]
;B[ol]LB[cm:A]C[Olawi: This cut is probably premature. A game-losing -move?

Tim: Perhaps it is a little bit premature, but this is quite a good plan. Black is very strong in the top right. You would really like to use this thickness to attack. By cutting here you are giving white a weak group close to this thickness. Furthermore this means that white now has two weak groups in the top half of the board. If you can make a splitting attack against these two then one of them might actually die. And even if you don't kill one of them, white will be so busy defending that you ought to be able to win the game during the fight. Say by turning the left side into solid territory.

Now is it premature? Your one problem is that your two cutting stones will become a weak group. White will be able to defend his stones by attacking you. This gives white a chance. The moves in the fight will be very important and it will be essential to send the fight in the right direction.
  If the cut is premature then you would like to find a move that makes white worry about the possiblility of you cuting. 'A' might be a way of achieveing that. 'A' is a big move in itself. And if you cut later and both black and white both run across the middle of the board then the stone at balck 'A' might ind up in just the right place for the black weak group to connect to.]
;W[ok]
(;B[ll]C[This is not right. Black is trying to push white into the black wall at the top. Also, white is thick at the bottom (even thicker than he appears at first sight because white cam play moves like N4 in sente to increase his thickness.) So black wants to move away from the bottom.]
;W[mk]C[The other problem with black's last move is that it leaves white this peep which helps white a lot.]
;B[ml];W[kj]
(;B[im]C[This is a bad move. It must be almost possible for white to cut here and capture the four black cutting stones. Even if white can't do that, black will still have to add another move to strengthen this jump. So in fact this move is slower than the more normal one point jump.

The key proverb in running fights is "The one point jump is never wrong."It is not always true, but ignore it at your peril.]
;W[ik];B[km];W[gl]C[Here we see white making good use of an attack. White is building thickness in the centre whilst attacking. This thickness means that the three white stones at the top are no longer so weak. It also limits the amount ot territory that black can make on the left side.]
;B[lj];W[li]C[Good style by white.];B[mj];W[mi];B[lk]LB[nk:A]
[oi:B][nj:C][ki:D]C[Olawi: This way, because I figured that if white connects with 'A', I would play the moves from 'B' to 'D'.

Tim: Yes, but this is not terribly relevant. white would only play A if he was certain that he was going to kill black. Otherwise the move at A is worth at most 2 points gote. If white is interested in killing black then it would be better to attack the rest of black's eye-space and leave this half eye alone.]
;W[jk];B[io];W[mp]LB[pr:A]C[Olawi: Should I have saved this group with 'A'?

Tim: That would be sensible. Saving this group is worth more than 30 points gote. May be even 40. Furthermore, if you keep this group alive then the surrounding white group is still a little bit weak. That will help you save your group in the middle.]

;B[hn];W[dr];B[ej]C[I think that the game is now effectively over.

Assuming the black lives in the middle:

White:

Bottom right: 35+
Top right: 10
Bottom left: 20-
Top: 5
Komi: 5

Total 75:

Black:

Right: 20
Top: 5

This means that black needs to make 50 points on the left side. No chance really,]

(;B[kp]C[Now white has a difficult problem. Sure, white can caputre half of the black stones, but that is OK. Black was going to sacrifice them anyway.

This is the secret of sabaki (making a viable group in your opponent's area of strength.

The formation like this where one player has a shimari in one corner facing a 3-4 point in the neighbouring courner is one that has appeared in professional games for a long, long time.
