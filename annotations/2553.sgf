C[Hello, I am curious to which moves will be strongest and most efficient in the opening.  I would also like to know moves to settle fast with efficiency and correct time.  Fighting moves to attack groups with efficiency too.  Although this game is a short one, I am looking for good openings in beginning that will keep me settled strong and efficient . GOOD LUCK

Hi!

I don't know if I can help you with your wishes formulated above, but I hope you will find my commentaries at least a little bit helpful anyway :)

I'll sum up my commentary at the end.

Good luck with your games!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[jp]C[Would like to develop a nice moyo.];W[qn];B[od]LB[po:A]
C[Not sure if this is correct way of playing, but I think that it works well against white stone.

- - - - -

Making a shimari can't be bad, but there are many other ways of playing of course. Did you think about B A?]
;W[qq]LB[qk:A]C[I prefer W A here.];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[po];W[op];B[qo];W[oo]LB[pn:A][rr:B]C[Is this right? usually white will capture q3 instead.

Bad because A is such a good point for Black. White should play B instead.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[pn];W[lq];B[kq]C[perhaps k3 would be wiser in the outcome later on.

well, you didn't know about it at this moment :)];W[lp];B[on]
LB[ql:A]C[How about A here?!];W[qi];B[qg]C[like this because it makes n17 not as important on top right.]
;W[ql]C[Observing game 49 (mlopez vs. T0kyo) :
        guest14 NR
Found 1 observer.];B[no]LB[nr:A]C[I really don't like this move. It adds nothing to the black position but eleminates a lot of aji in the white group. Without it, Black can try A for example. So attacking the right at once should be better.]
;W[np];B[pk]C[Best way here to attack group?

- - - - - - 

Looks fine :)];W[qk];B[pi]
(;W[qh]LB[pj:A]C[Bad, A is the only move here (see variation).]
;B[ph];W[rg];B[rf]C[I think if he just connects at q10 i will be in trouble.

- - - - - 

Better for White, but not that bad for Black :) (see variation)]

(;W[qf];B[pg];W[re];B[rh];W[sf];B[qj];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[kc]
LB[fc:A]C[because the r13 has no more impact perhaps here is nice to develop?

- - - - - -

A is at least a more positive way of playing.];W[fc];B[mo]LB[ln:C]
[nn:A][lo:B]C[Very very bad :(  Maybe the worst move of the game...  It leaves a weakness at A and forces Whie to make a good move at B, which reduces your moyo and weakens your stones at the bottom. If you want to enlarge your moyo here, you should play at C!]
;W[lo];B[ci]LB[lm:A]C[Very big in my opinion.

Yes, but not consistent with your last move. If you didn't want to continue at the bottom, why did you start playing there?! Leaving things like this only give White a perfect move at A.]
;W[cg];B[cl];W[dr];B[el]C[Here because i don't want to lose the base on left to let white attack two weak groups.

- - - - - -

A useful move, nothing to say against it.];W[dk];B[ck];W[hq]
C[Would have been nice if I k3'd before.];B[gp]C[Only way to attack?

- - - - - 

Who is attaking  here, Black or White?!];W[iq]LB[hp:A]C[Must be at A.]
;B[lr];W[mq]LB[mr:A]C[Also weak - why not A??];B[ip];W[fr];B[hp]
;W[gq];B[fp]C[Probably not urgent as running into center is?

- - - - - 

A good, thick move];W[oj];B[pj];W[en]C[Good!];B[bn]C[Not even sure if sente.]
;W[cm]LB[bo:A]C[Should be at A.];B[bm];W[co]C[White gives away a lot, in gote moreover,  and gets nothing back in return. A most likable opponent :)]
;B[fn];W[dl];B[lm]C[Yes!! :)];W[km];B[kn];W[ln];B[mm]C[Felt cut was only way to use moyo properly

- - - - -

Fighting here is normal.];W[jm];B[jn];W[im];B[gl]C[Works well in attacking the 3 stone and escaping no?

Good one...];W[in];B[kp];W[ll];B[ml]LB[jj:A]C[Is this an attacking move?! During the last moves, you said: my positions here are strong, I'll attack you! But this one is more like: whoa, your positoion is strong, I'll better defend. A move around A would have been more consistent.]
;W[jj];B[ik]LB[hc:G][eq:B][er:A][gr:E][jr:C][mr:F][nr:D]C[One way to attack?

- - - -

Looks ok, since  you have to look after your own stones, too. Maybe you should probe at A at some moment to test White's response there. W B can then be answered by B C (threatening B D), W F, B E. If  White answers in a way that gives you some eye shape at the bottom, you can play at G then, making points and building up strengh for an attack, too. If White defends in the center then ( with a move worthless in terms of territory), you can take another big point]
;W[jk];B[il]LB[ih:B][hi:A]C[Almost useless. How about B A? I myself would have played B B, but that is maybe a little bit unresonable :)]
;W[jl]C[Bad shape - Black can't cut there, so simply jumping out was best.]
;B[hi];W[jh];B[hg];W[ij];B[hj];W[jf];B[id]LB[hc:A]C[Better at A]
;W[ih];B[hh]C[Felel good here about influence and using the moyo]
;W[lk]TR[jf][jh][jj][jk][jl][ll]SQ[id][hg][hh][hi][hj][ik]C[ I think you gave yourself a difficult game here. Please look at the marked white stones - the are all useful, reducing the scale of Black's potential territory. The marked black stones do nothing at all! So, the only way to justify them is to capture the white center group - a lot of hard work  ahead :)
So, please, play an attack in a way that makes sure you will get some profit out of it!]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[oq]LB[qs:A]SQ[mo][no]C[This is a rather short game and the opponent ran out of time here.  I think that he can live with me losing n2 stones.  But from here on out, im not sure if i can win with the given positions, any comments on playing and attacking globabally as well as settling groups strong would be nice to hear.

SINCERLY, TOM 2k* IGS

This  doesn't kill the white group - White can live with A. I would like to see you play moves like p3 only if you are sure to kill, because otherwise you lose points (B A instead of the marked stone would have been a nice sente endgame here).

Too sum up the game: I think you played quite well. If you can avoid bad moves like the squared ones, your game will improve a lot. Strategically, if you attack, please work out a way to profit from the attack before starting it! The way you attacked the white stones in the center was a bit thoughtless.
