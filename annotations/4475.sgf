AB[pd][dp]C[SC I will use my initials in front of my comments to make them easier to identify.]
;W[jp]C[SC This is an unusal opening move.  If white has a specific plan in mind, then this is OK.  If this is more of a "gee, what happens if I put a stone here" sort of move, then it is a bad move.
Standard opening moves in the corners are standard because they work best most of the time.  So, unless you have a really good reason, don't do weird stuff.]
;B[dc];W[pp];B[mc]TR[pc][oc][nc]SQ[de][ce][co][cn][dj][cj][di]
[ci]C[SC This isn't a good opening move. 
The current move is too far from the upper right corner to really defend it.  It is also too close to the black stone at Q16 to be a good opening extension across the top.  So, If you really want to play on the top side, then either secure the corner by playing on one of the triangles, or stake out more territory by playing K16 or K17.
The variation starting next move helps explain why this move is too far from the upper right corner to defend it.
The opening is all about staking out large areas of potential territory.  One rule of thumb is to find the largest gap between stones and play in it.  In this case, the space between the black stones at D17 and D4 is the largest empty space.  The squares are all reasonable options for playing in this space.]

(;W[dd]C[SC See the variation for a white invasion of the top right corner.]
;B[ec]C[SC This means black doesn't want a fight.  Since black is receiving a handicap, we would assume that white is a better player and thus should be better at winning a complicated fight.  So, black's calm move here is a good idea.
Similarly, if you are white and giving a handicap, then you probably want to start several fights and make things very complicated for black.]
;W[de];B[cm]SQ[cc][qn][ch][pj]C[SC This move has the same problems as mentioned on move 4 at N17.
Also, the upper left corner isn't secure yet.  The 3x3 point (C17 in this corner) is generally the key to controlling a corner. In this case, the first person to play on C17 will most likely end up with control of this corner.
The squares are all better moves for black.  The two squares on the right side are examples of playing in the largest gap between stones.  The two left side squares are ways to pressure white's 2 upper left corner stones.]
;W[cf]SQ[cc][fq][ic][qf][pj]C[SC This is another example of a move that doesn't secure the corner and doesn't extend down the side enough to be a good opening move.  The squares are all better moves for white.]
;B[cl]SQ[cc][qe][qn][id][fq]C[SC This is much too small a move to play in the opening.  The stone at C7 isn't in danger, so black doesn't need to play here to defend it.  This move enlarges black's potential territory by 2 points (A8 and B8).  The squares all do much more for black.]
;W[cc]C[SC White is the first to play on the 3x3 point.  At the end of the game, white has control of this corner.]

(;B[gc]SQ[fd][gd]C[SC Black has too many moves on the third line.  Another opening "rule of thumb" is to play about half of your stones on the 3rd line and half on the 4th line.  If you feel an urge to play on anything other than the 3rd or 4th line during the opening, then stop and think very carefully since there is probably a better move somewhere.
Locally, the squares are both better than G12.
Globally, since white now controls the upper left corner, the black stones at D17 and E17 are not worth much.  Black should consider playing other important moves on the board and hope that white wastes time killing these two black stones.
See variation.];W[fc]C[SC White is starting a fight.  As mentioned previously, this is usually a good strategy for white when giving a handicap.]

(;B[fd]C[SC Black still needs to stop and consider whether it is worth while to try saving the two black stones at D17 and E17.  I think that black would be better off sacrificing them.
See Variation for an example of what I mean.];W[fb]
(;B[ed]C[SC Black can still sacrifice the two stones for a larger gain.
See variation.];W[gd]
(;B[hc]TR[ee][df]SQ[cd]MA[ge]C[SC This is a contact fight.  Contact fights are all about increasing your liberties while reducing your opponent's.
Before this stone was played, black had a 4 stone group with 4 liberties and a single stone group with 2 liberties; while white had a 2 stone group with 3 liberties and a four stone "group" that should be able to make two eyes in the corner.
The four white stones are considered a single group because black can't cut them apart by playing on the square.  If black had stones on both triangles, then the cut might work and white's stones would be considered 2 groups.
At this point, black can either attack white or run away.  Running away only works for one group at a time.  Since black has 2 weak groups, running away would mean sacrificing one of the groups to save the other.  If black attacks, then the only thing to attack is the 2 stone white group.  White's other 4 stones can make two eyes, so they can't be killed.  Attacking live groups doesn't accomplish anything.
The current move works for running the single stone group away; which means that black should be planning to sacrifice the 4 stone group.
Playing at the 'X' and then at F14 works for running the 4 stone group away and sacrificing the single stone group.
See the variation for black attacking white.];W[ge];B[cb]SQ[id]
C[SC Black started to run one group away but now switches to the other group.  This is bad.  Playing at the square is better.]
;W[db];B[ca];W[eb]SQ[gc][hc]C[SC Now black has 3 weak groups to defend.  The marked stones have the most liberties and they face black's stones in the upper right corner.  These two stones can be saved easily. The other 2 black groups are doomed and black should quit wasting stones on them.]
;B[cd]C[SC At move 18 I mentioned that this cut doesn't work for black.]
;W[bc];B[ac];W[bd];B[bb];W[ce]C[SC White doesn't need to capture here.  Even if black played here first, black's two stones would still be in Atari]
;B[aa]SQ[dc][ec][ed][fd]C[What would be a better way to secure this corner?

SC The variation at move 18 leads to a much better result for black.  Even further back, playing move 10 at C17 rather than C8 would have secured this corner.
After white played on G16 (move 19) there hasn't been any real hope for the marked black stones.  The 5 black stones around A19 never had any real hope, although white might have made an error and let them live.]
;W[ee]SQ[dc][ec][ed][fd]C[SC White doesn't need to do this.  The marked black stones already can't escape.  Once the stones are dead, stop killing them.]
;B[gb]TR[dd][de][ee]SQ[gc][hc]MA[bb][cb][ca]C[SC This is an empty triangle.  They are bad shape.  This means that making an empty triangle is almost always NOT the best move. So, if you feel an urge to make an empty triangle, stop and think and look around for something better.
The marked white stones are not an empty triangle because of the black stone at E16. This full triangle is not nearly as bad as making an empty triangle.
Playing this stone at H16 would be a better move for black.  One way to tell that H16 is better is the fact that it makes a full triangle.
The only time empty triangles are good is when you are making eyes.  So, the black empty triangle at C18 isn't bad because black was trying to make two eyes in the corner at the time.]
;W[fe]C[SC White didn't need to capture at this time.  These black stones were dead even before white's previous move.]
;B[id]C[SC Good];W[ad]C[SC The black stones in the corner are already dead.  They have one true eye at B19 and one false eye at A18.  They have no room to run away or to make another eye, so they are dead and white can move on to something else.]
;B[jd]C[SC This is good locally, but these stones are not in danger at this time and there is still a lot of empty space on the right side to claim.  So, while this isn't a bad move, it is too early in the game to play it.]
;W[da]TR[fq][qf][pj][qn][nq]SQ[ce][ee][fe][ad]C[SC White's past five moves have all been unnecessary. This means that white could have passed for 5 turns and accomplished about the same as these five moves did.   Imagine what the board would look like if white had played these 5 stones on the triangles instead]
;B[qj]C[SC Very Good
I would say that the opening is now finished.  The big fight in the upper left corner was a mid-game type of exchange, and white's last two stones on the first line are more like end-game moves. But the opening could not really be finished while there was such a large open area on the right side.
Playing end-game moves during the opening is a good sign that you are not selecting the best possible move.]
;W[jj]TR[pf][pg][qf]SQ[cj][fq][ql][qp]C[SC I don't think this is the best move.  Starting here, white works to connect the upper left and lower right corners.  This would be a good idea if one of the white groups was weak and threatened. Both groups are strong and secure, however, so connecting them doesn't do anything useful.
Similarly, black spends a lot of time trying to prevent this connection; which is also a waste of time.
Playing this move at one of the squares would be better.  Playing at the triangles is also better, but more risky]
;B[ig]TR[ad][bd][ce][de][ee][fe][ge]SQ[pj][eq][qn][hq][qe]C[SC Don't cut strong groups.
Playing on any of the squares would be better.  Black should avoid playing on the left side near white's huge wall.]
;W[ik];B[nj]C[SC Good.];W[hk]SQ[hm][gj]C[SC This is too close to the J9 stone.  If white wants to connect these stones to an edge, then small knight's moves, like the squares, are better.]
;B[if];W[gf]TR[fe][ge]SQ[gg]C[SC This makes an empty triangle.  Playing at the square would be better]
;B[hh]SQ[mg]C[SC This move doesn't secure any territory for black and doesn't threaten any weak white groups. Playing around the square would secure a lot of territory for black.]
;W[ih]SQ[kh][li]C[SC This starts another contact fight.  This fight has no purpose, however. Neither player has weak groups to defend and there isn't any center territory to destroy or capture.  If white wants to reduce the huge potential territory in the upper right, then the squares are better.]
;B[hg];W[ie]
(;B[he]C[SC At this point, one of black's main goals should be to secure as much of the potential territory in the upper right as possible. That is more important that killing one white stone.
See variation];W[je];B[ke]SQ[nj]C[SC This is a ladder.  Both players should be able to read out where the ladder will go.  In this case, the ladder ends at the marked black stone with white dying.]
;W[jf]SQ[li]C[SC Since the ladder doesn't work for white, don't waste stones playing here.  White could play on the square instead, since that would serve as a ladder breaker and let white live.  Once that is done, white can start to play out the ladder.]
;B[jg];W[ji];B[kf];W[hd];B[hf]TR[he][if]SQ[ib]MA[mg][qn][nq]
[hq]C[SC This increases black's score by 1 point while making an empty triangle. There are a lot of moves worth more than one point on the board. If you really want to play a stone in this area, then the square is good for protecting the potential cutting point at J17.  Otherwise, the X marked spots are all worth a lot more than 1 point.]
;W[jh];B[je]C[SC This makes 2 eyes for this group of black stones.  They don't need this done, however, since this group is connected to the upper side black stones]
;W[hi];B[fi]SQ[fh]C[SC The small knight's move can almost always be cut by a determined opponent.  Locally, the square is better since that can't be cut.  Globally, black is still wasting time trying to cut apart strong white groups]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[gg];B[gj]TR[fi][gi];W[hj];B[ek];W[fk];B[gk];W[ej]
;B[fl];W[fj];B[dj]C[SC This is a ladder that works for white since it runs into the white stones in the upper left.]
;W[ei];B[eh]SQ[gl]C[SC Don't play out a ladder that you can't win.  Locally, playing at the square saves 4 black stones.  Globally, this exchange seems to be helping white secure more territory on the left side. If you are helping your opponent, stop and do something else.]

SC This makes an eye, but black doesn't need to make eyes at this time.  Black has enough space here to make eyes at any time, so black is not in danger.]

;W[gr];B[kh]SQ[ng]C[SC Good. This helps secure the large area around the square for black.]

(;W[gs]SQ[qn][qc]C[This was unnecessary...  Better ideas?

SC The squares are better.  The 3x3 point invasion in the upper right (see variation at move 5) allows black to make a large wall, which normally would be bad for white.  In this case, however, the black wall faces an area that black already controls.  So, white gains the corner without giving much to black.
