C[Don't speend too much time on me, I made a lot of stupid mistakes. I just didn't see them before the happened. If you can give me a short overview that would be great. I think my opening was bad and I let myself get boxed in.
Thankyou

JoJoprova [?\]: hi...i'm total beginner..GO!
cospof [?\]: I'm also a begginer is that ok
JoJoprova [?\]: :)

Hi, you played a pretty good game.  The main problem is that you made a lot of unnecessary defensive moves.  If you'd played a bit more aggressively, you would've done much better.  In the review I give some examples of some possible places to play, especially when you make a defensive move, these are just some suggestions and you shouldn't think that they're necessarily the best place to play.   The important thing is not so much playing at the proper spot, but rather playing with the right intention, i.e. trying to attack instead of always defending.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd];B[jd];W[pe]C[This is a very slow move.]
;B[ld]TR[dj][pj][qj][qn][jp][nq]C[Not necessary, this move doesn't do much.  White's Q15 move gives you a chance to get ahead.  Some common moves are marked with triangles.]
;W[mg];B[jj]C[Good move!  This enlarges your framework and reduces his at the same time.]
;W[mi];B[ji]LB[kg:A]TR[jd][ld]C[This move's way too slow, and doesn't accomplish much.  white can still push through.  If you wanted to play in the area, playing around A would probably be better, as it would help build a wall and at the same time make a loose connection to your top stones (marked with triangles)]
;W[jp];B[gn];W[jn];B[hm]LB[im:A]C[Another slow move.  Don't be afraid to play more aggressively, especially in the beginning.  I recommend playing at A instead, as this puts more pressure on his stones and makes a better connection to your center stones.]
;W[in]
(;B[hn]TR[hm][gn][hn]SQ[qk][qn]C[Unnecessary.  You create an empty triangle (the triangle marked group) which is an inefficient shape.  You don't need to respond to J6, maybe you could use this as an opportunity to invade.  The entire right side is still wide open, white has some stones in the area but they are spread out pretty thin.  Some good invasion points are marked with squares.  See the variations for a few standard continuations.

You could also use this as an opportunity to strengthen your framework, the best place to do that would probably be the left side star point.]
;W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[hk];W[ho];B[fo]TR[go]SQ[fp][fq]C[Your past few moves have been a little passive.  Don't be afraid to play more aggressively, for instance here you could play at G5 (triangle) instead.  Or if you were trying to start an area along the bottom, F3 or F4 (squares) would be better.]
;W[kg];B[jg]LB[ig:A]C[In general, you want to avoid playing contact moves (with some exceptions that you will learn as you get stronger).  Playing  one space back at A would do a better job of building a wall and keeping white out of your prosective territory.]
;W[jf]
(;B[jh]C[This is another passive move.  You're stronger in this area than white is, so you should attack him instead of just defending.  See the variation for one possible way of continuing.]
;W[kf];B[kd]TR[if]C[This move cost you a lot of territory, as you let him break into your area with his next move.  Keeping him out of your potential territory at J14 (triangle) is a must here.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ig];B[ie];W[id];B[je]LB[hd:A]C[Here's a time that it would be good to atari.  giving atari at J16 (A) before connecting at L15 would be a better continuation, as it attacks white more strongly.]
;W[hd]
(;B[ih]C[Try to avoid playing atari's just because you can, this is a problem that a lot of newer players have.  It's usually not a good idea to play an atari unless you have read out a continuation that works for you.

In this case, if you'd atari'd from the other side you could've captured the stone in a net (see the variation).]
;W[hg];B[nd];W[hi];B[ij];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[ep];W[le]
(;B[dn]TR[he]SQ[hd][id][hf][hg][ig][hi]C[Not sure what you were afraid of here, this was a move that doesn't seem to be defending anything.  White's marked stones are in a lot of trouble right now, they are stuck up against some strong black stones.  you should try to attack them, a good place to start is H15 (triangle) so that you can split his forces apart.  Once you split him up, it's very unlikely that he will be able to make both groups live.

See the variation for one possible continuation, where white gives up his top group to try to make his bottom group live.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[nf];B[fl]C[Another unnecessary defensive move.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb];B[ik]TR[jb][lb]C[What were you trying to do here?  You don't need to worry about your center stones getting separated, J9 and H10 are miai to connect the 2 groups. (that is, if white plays one of those 2 points, you play the other).  You should attack white on the top, he's in a bad position right now.   You can cut at either of the triangle points and you should be able to capture a stone or two and make at least one eye.]
;W[nc];B[hh];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[hj]TR[gg][fh]C[Here you're doing white a favor.  You should instead decend to G10, this way you catch the white stone at H11 and you have several cutting points to attack at the triangle points.]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[fk];B[em];W[el];B[dm];W[dl];B[fm]C[Too defensive.]

;B[gg];W[gi]
(;B[fg]C[At this point you still could've saved your L16 group, see the variation.]

[br][dr][as][bs][cs]C[You played a good game.  The main problem was that you played too defensively.  Here are a few things to keep in mind that should help a lot:

1. Don't let your opponent push you around.
2. Tenuki whenever possible.  Tenuki means playing away from where your opponent just played.  So if your opponent makes a small move at the top, don't respond there but instead take a bigger point somewhere else on the board.
3. Try to keep your stones connected (you could've saved your top center group if  they hadn't been cut off)
4. In the opening especially, don't place your stones too close together.  It's important to spread your stones out so that they can work together efficiently.

Nice game, keep practicing and good luck with your future games.]
