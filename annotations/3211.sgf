C[I resigned early because of a serious local mistake (the move 92 I think, when instead of capturing I continued a net). After that, everything was going crazy.
So,
1. I would like to know if, after that terrible mistake, I could find a way to make things better.
2. It is not first time, so, when I have a running group, caught in claws, what should I do (my right up group is an example)? How to jump somewhere and make safety for that group?
3. Why and how I recognize situations in which I am in danger in being caught in claws?

Thank you, Radu



Hallo Rado,

Thanks to you, that I have the chance to comment this game. 
Please bear in mind that i am not much stronger than you too.
But I will try< to point out some of my thoughts.
I hope you will enjoy it.
I enjoyed tha game very much, it was quite interesting.

C[g4: A little loose.];B[ce];W[de];B[dd];W[cf];B[be];W[bd];B[bf]
C[g4: Unnecessary, and making white stronger.];W[bg];B[ee];W[df]
;B[ch]C[g4: Blunder as white is connected.]
(;W[bh]LB[dh:A]C[g4: Why? At least cap on the top with A at D12. So black gets little outward influence for nearly nothing. But easier may be the variation]
;B[ci];W[cm]C[g4: Good, taking black's base.];B[cg]C[g4: Another blunder.]
;W[eh]LB[fg:A]C[g4: Tha shape move is at A at F13. But this is fine too.]
;B[bi];W[af];B[ei];W[gq]LB[fh:A][gh:B][dq:C][jq:D]C[g4: This seems the first time, you missed a chance. Black has 2 weak groups. Kepp them separated. Therefore I like A at F12 or B at G12.
Locally the move at G3 does not protect the corner. I would prefer C at D3 or D at K3.]
;B[fh]C[g4: Black uses his chance.];W[fg];B[gg];W[fi]C[g4: This is dangerous. If the black stones get strong black can get his M17 stone running.]
;B[gh];W[ej];B[di];W[dk]C[g4: This leave a lot of bad aji. See variation.]

(;B[ck]C[g4: But black is friendly.];W[dl];B[le]C[g4: Once black is strong white is in trouble. I think you cannot recover both white groups. One possible approach to this may be to give up the 3 stones on the right. There still remains a lot of aji because all the black stones are high and the corner is open. See the variation.]

(;W[lg];B[kf];W[ke];B[kd];W[je];B[lf];W[mf];B[jf]LB[kg:A]C[g4: I would have turner at A at L13. But now the white stones look lonely.]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[kc];B[ld];W[jb];B[mb];W[db]C[g4: This is too early now. You might want to have F18 as a last ressort to bring your stones to life.]
;B[eb];W[bb]LB[gf:A]C[g4: Better to take the 3 stones. The the cut at G14 (A) works.]
;B[mi]C[g4: Dangerous by black.];W[ge];B[gf];W[eg]C[g4: Not necessary now. Black can connect with the Ko. But he could have done so the last 20 moves I think. 
But if you want to protect, it is better to take the stones.]
;B[ff]C[g4: This sequence was only helping black. His stones are strong now and I don't see how white can recover.]
;W[kh]
(;B[ii]C[g4: Good move by black as he saves his already dead stones. But he could have played more aggressive as in the varaition.]
;W[ji];B[fj];W[ig];B[ih]LB[if:A]C[g4: ? A at J14 is the only move.]
;W[if]C[g4: Now you recovered a lot.];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[lh]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[mh];W[mg];B[ob];W[ij]C[g4: This makes not much sense. What if black take the stone at F11?]
;B[kj]C[g4: Strange idea.];W[gi]C[g4: Very dangerous. You play on knife's edge. What if black followes the variation?
The black group on the left seem to be your main target. But this are only about 20 points. The right side is much bigger. It is very important to be ahead there.]

(;B[fk];W[hj]LB[hh:A]C[g4: Why not take the 3 black stones at A( H12). Then white looks fine again.]
;B[jj]
(;W[ki]C[g4: Even now you could have played as in the variation. 
You should always look for the best moves, even if you realized that you played a bad move.]
;B[hh]C[g4: This looks similar to the variation. Now the game is really over.]

(;W[ik]C[g4: The last chance is to play as in the variation.]

;B[qd]C[g4: Black should continue pushing.];W[ka]C[g4: Good. You are rescuing your white center group.]
;B[pb];W[lb];B[mc];W[qc];B[qb]
(;W[rb]LB[rc:A]C[g4: A at S17 is the only move. See var.];B[rc]

(;W[od]C[g4: Better to take the stone. See var.
It seems as you had resigned by heart.];B[oe];W[nd];B[rd];W[jq]
;B[mp];W[lq];B[nr];W[on];B[ok]
(;W[nk];B[ol];W[pn];B[om]C[g4: Gaame over. 

This was really a fighting game. There were some reading errors. But I think this is normal for us amateurs.
But you should have a picture of the whole board. And you should try to imagine have the board looks like if a reasonable sequence is played. 
During the game the status of the game changed often due to living and killing of important groups. 
I hope I could give you some hints to think over. If there are any questions, please contact me.

Have fun with your next games

You should be aware that all the black stones at the left side hve only one eye in gote. A move at A (B9) kills them all.]
