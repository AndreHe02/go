C[As you can probobly see this is a game played between two total beginners, and as such a game both make some huge mistakes. We both did however play to the best of our abilities. I believe we played for alot longer than an hour, and spent an other 45min discussing the game afterwards. I would really appriciate it if you had time to comment on this game, since i believe it would improve both mine and my friends playing.


Hi, I'm a 15kyu from Germany, I'll start my commentary with 'Paw:']

(;B[pf];W[jg]
(;B[lm]C[Do you think i should have made this move more into the middle?

Paw: As a rule of thumb, corners are most attractive, then borders, then the centre. Invading the left border, with C14 for example, would still be a good plan.]
;W[jk];B[nl];W[mi]
(;B[li]TR[jg][mi][jk]C[Paw: You're putting your stone in a weak position between the marked stones, and playing a contact, which tends to be favorable for the opponent in general, only makes it worse.]
;W[lj];B[lh];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg]
(;B[nh];W[ni]
(;B[og];W[oh];B[oi]C[Do you think that i should have moved more to the middle at this point? Also i think i moved way too late into the left side, in such a situation how would you move towards the upper and middle left?

Paw: The best option would have been not to initiate that fight with M11, the position resulting from that was just favorable for white.]
;W[ph];B[ng];W[pj];B[mj];W[nj];B[oj];W[mk]
(;B[nq]C[Paw: This is somewhat inconsequent. You should have played either N9 or P9, this way you just gave white a free advantage.]
;W[ok]
(;B[rf];W[rh];B[qo]C[Paw: This move is not really necessary, the corner is already safe.]
;W[qm]
(;B[rn];W[rm]
(;B[sn];W[sm];B[qf]TR[pf][rf]C[Paw: This is too defensive. The marked stones already create a wall that's very strong.]
;W[pi]
(;B[on];W[ol]
(;B[nm];W[nk]
(;B[mm]TR[nl][lm][nm]C[Paw: Also too defensive. The three stones are already impenetrable.]
;W[pg]
(;B[of];W[qg]
(;B[pe]C[Paw: Also unneccessary, there isn't any danger here. There are still many big points to make.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[ne]
(;B[oc];W[mc]
(;B[nb];W[mb];B[na];W[ma];B[mr]C[Paw: Again a move in an area that's quite secure for you.]

;B[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[de];B[dc]C[I think this move was a bad one from me. Do you think i should have played it somewhere around G17 or D13 instead?

Paw: I think C14 would have the best approach move, allowing you to move to C17 into the corner or C11 along the border alternatively.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cd]

(;B[nf]C[Paw: Too early to give up the corner yet, there's still some potential.]

;W[ld];B[kh];W[jh];B[kg];W[kf];B[oe];W[me];B[jb]C[Another useless place to play. What would have been a good place to play at this point when i've almost completly lost the left side?

Paw: No, it wasn't useless. At this time, it's already very hard to play anything useful, it would have been important to develop the left side of the board much earlier.]

;B[dm]C[Is there really any point in playing in this direction?
What would have been better?

Paw: At this point, if white doesn't make any major mistake, it's very difficult to do anything on the left side. Perhaps a very strong dan player would find a way to live, but from my perspective it's pretty hopeless.]
;W[em];B[fi]C[What would have been the best course of action at this stage to make the 3 black live? I was lucky when my opponent made a mistake later on, but is there any way here to live if the opponent doesnt make a big mistake?]

;W[ig];B[di];W[ck];B[dh];W[ci]C[I think this mistake really saved me on the lower left side, if he would have played at D13 i think i would have been dead. If he had played on D13, what would have been the best course of action, or was it completly lost already?

Paw: Yes, white's lead was too large at this point to turn the game around. I will stop the commentary here, since there's nothing much to do anymore in this game.]
