AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[My comments in this game may sound very harsh, but I didn't find another way to express my thoughts on this game. So I apologize in advance... And one more thing, I find it very hard to believe your opponent in this game is 6k - there is not one move he made which I can critisize, so my guess would be that he is a dan player, not a kyu player.]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[fc];B[hc];W[pi]C[Attaching like this looks very impatient. You cannot fight with B so early in the game when he has many handicap stones. You need to be patient and build strong groups first.]

;B[bk];W[eh];B[dg];W[hf]C[when you have to go back here to defend, it clearly shows the error of invading without being strong. In a handicap game the key is to keep as much potential as possible. Rushing in before you are strong enough to see it through is a sure way to destroy potential.]
