C[Hi.

I won this game by 0.5 points but I feel I should have lost it. Still I can only find one real misstake there I directly see how I should have done it better.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj]C[Sanreisei is a favourite of mine. I play very influence based Go.]
;W[ec];B[dj];W[ch]
(;B[dn]MA[cn]C[I personnally prefer C6 (X) instead, because you have more chances in the corner and an extension from the fouth to the third line is more difficult to invade.]
;W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[jp]C[Looks interesting: Although the left group does not have a base yet, the last move spends some help. I think, it is OK.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[nn];B[mq];W[nq];B[gq];W[fq]C[This sequence is not good. You strnghthen White on both sides while still remaining very thin. If you think, your group is already in trouble, e.g. just walk to the center. this would also help your left weak group and keep the pressure on the white groups.]
;B[gr];W[mr];B[lq];W[qq]C[Now you see the problem: The lower black group still does not have a base and White easily enters the corner (because you have strengthened him).]

(;B[qp]C[I think it is better to seperate like in the variation. This keeps the pressure on the white group.]
;W[pq]C[Now the white group is strong and black has still lost the corner.]
;B[kc];W[qf]
(;B[qh]MA[pl]C[No, too small. You have already a stone there (Q10), so why not keep pressing on white like in the variation? The drawback is that you do not even do a lot for the right group. White can still easily invade at Q8 (X)]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe];B[hc]
C[relatively big, but I think defending the right border is now most urgend. The problem on the right side is: White is now strong at the upper and lower border, so a fight, which started by separating the black group would surely leave black in a very weak position. See the variation.]

(;W[bj]C[Also quite big, but the invasion on the right is more urgend and surely sente.]
;B[cl]MA[nj]C[This move I'm not sure about. What is the best way to defend against that underslide?

TA: You are right, this does not help. There is no more black territory here, so what do you want to defend? Better use the move elsewhere (e.g. X, which also prepares an attack against the upper right).]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[lr];B[kr];W[eh];B[ge]C[I wasn't really sure how to play here. I felt that if he could play G16 then he would have a huge corner that I wouldn't be able to do much about. This move limits his corner a bit and sets up for a move on the left side to increase my moyo.

TA: That's quite OK. But to defend against the invasion on the right is still most important, as you see.]
;W[pl]C[Eventually the hard hit!];B[om]C[Now two weak groups are struggeling. I think the game is already decided...]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[nk];B[nm];W[oj]MA[ok]C[this should be at X, since black can force this anyway, and then 56 is not helpful at all.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[oh];W[qm];B[mh];W[pi];B[oi];W[qj]C[Now black has already suffered a huge loss. this was his area of influence...]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[mk]C[This fight didn't go very well. I'm not sure how I should have played instead.

TA: The fight istself was not so bad, but to let it come to this fight was the error.]
;W[sb]MA[mf]C[If white is afraid of his group, he should first run into the center.

This is very often a good idea. Weaker players prefer seeing two small eyes in the corner against a huge group streching out to the center. Even though, you cannot see clearly where the eyes come from I recommend running into the center. this will very often help some other groups of yours. Make your stones work together! Here I would have suggested X.]
;B[mf]
(;W[ef]MA[gh]C[Much too small. If black could make a move here, you only lose 5 points or so. Instead a move at X (G12) would serve at least two good purposes: Annulate a lot of blacks influence in the center and increase the pressure on the bottom left black group. this is perfect: While attacking, you make some profit. If black defends his upper territory, a severe attack on the left group will follow. See the variation...]
;B[gh]C[Good. Surprising big black territory comes up...];W[fi]
;B[hj]C[Maybe G11 would have been better but I was afraid that he would start a wall downwards and that my left group would be isolated. This way I thought that I still had the chance so connect out with it.

TA: Its good anyway to play loosely like 73 and stay a bit awy from the opponent. this way you are more flexible.]
;W[fk];B[fn]
(;W[fr]C[It is much more effective to make a move on the outside, because it serves double purpose again. See the variation.]
;B[hq];W[mj];B[lj];W[lp];B[kp];W[mp];B[lk];W[qb]C[Why such a small gote move. You cxan still make it when you are in trouble...]
;B[pb];W[ra];B[hl]C[G8 maybe?];W[gn];B[fl];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[ik];W[gi];B[hi];W[ho];B[jn]C[To connect out with my low group and still keep white from running in from the left.

TA: OK.];W[qn];B[qo];W[kq];B[jq];W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[ll];W[mm]

;W[io];B[jo];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[gc]C[Here I made two dumb mistakes but I was behind as it was now so this was not deciding in any way.

TA: I agree...];W[ib];B[fb];W[ja];B[kb];W[ka];B[mb];W[ic];B[id]

;W[oo];B[po];W[rq];B[rn];W[rm]C[Here is the move that saves the game for me. But in the end I'm not sure he could have done better. I find no way for the white group to live here. Still I didn't play S6 to kill his group it just felt like a big move at the time. This is why I think I should have lost the game. I only killed it by mistake.

TA: Poor white, maybe you are right.];B[ql]
(;W[qk]C[I think, this is the big error. Why not the variation?]

[bs][cs][ds][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Not sure where it went wrong. His upper left corner is huge but I couldn't find a good way to invade it.

The strategi I used is one I often use, not careing so much for the corners but instead trying to use influnce to build large side moyos that like in this game might even extend into the center. I guess I play a sort of cosmic Go but I agree with Takemiya, it's the way the stones move naturally for me.

This strategi often work fine for me. I win maybe 2/3 of the games I play against 12-10 kyu players. Only (except here) loosing then I make terriable fighting misstakes.

TA: Building influence is a good strategy. But keep in mind that you use your influence best to attack and to profit while attacking! This is the secret! Only making big moyos while your opponent does the same does not help so much. You lost the game, when white split your right group into two and easily attacked them while profitting. OK, surpisingly you won, but you know that was very lucky.

Please try to use your strenght differently: when you have influence, attack! When you have a weak group, first secure it, so your opponent cannot attack them so easily, OK? This will at once make you three stones stronger, I bet!

Good luck!])
