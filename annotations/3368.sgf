AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[[Rilvar\] Hi, I'm Rilvar ([R\] hereafter), playing Black this game.  Right now I'm ranked around 26k on KGS.  Overall, any suggestions for black would be appreciated, but, as this is one of only a few handicap games I have ever played, any suggestions for handicap style play would also be appreciated.
K> hi, I'll try to give some tips as the game progresses but to start with some brief tips on handicap games as black: first, you should try not to get drawn into small local fights because that is what black wants. In the early opening use wider pincers than usual if they can double as wide extensions from another corner or group. Second, don't cling to territory early on - I know this sounds weird but if you can *enclose* white into small areas, chances are you will get greater benefits later in the game. For example, if white invades a corner, do not feel obliged to kill the invaders, if you can either wall him in or share the corner while keeping your access to the centre, you can consider it a success for you.

Enough vague ramblings, let's get to the game...]PL[W];W[nc]
;B[pf];W[qm]C[K> white is aiming at R12, which is an extension from R7 and an approach to your corner enclosure]
;B[lc];W[pc]C[[R\] Should I have enclosed my corner at P17 first before the pincer at L17?
K> first, A does not enclose the corner - the invasion at the 3-3 point is still available. Second, white is playing a short sighted move: you can force him to make small life in gote, while you build a strong outer wall in sente]
;B[qc];W[ne];B[le];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[kc]C[K> so far so good - you have opted to share the corner, which is fine, and forcing his group to run away while building a good wall facing along the top side]
;W[qh]
(;B[qg]C[K> this move is rather passive, consider instead P13 - it pushes out into the centre to defend your group, plus threatens to attack both white groups - see variations]
;W[ng];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[nq]C[K> when you are defending against a double approach to your star point, your objective should be to run out to the centre. You achieve this by attacking one of the approach stones (usually the *weaker* one), starting with an attachment to the *other*  stone - do *not* be too concerned with corner territory (unless white changes plan and backs off) , because you will get a strong position in compensation - see variation]

(;B[oq];W[no];B[np];W[mp];B[op];W[mr];B[qn];W[qo];B[po];W[pn]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[on]C[K> OK so you have a large corner (15 points or so), but see how white is dominating the right and bottom sides! If he keeps the right side he will get 20+ points, and he can expect another 10-20 on the bottom.]
;B[gp]C[[R\] Would it be better to play a star point move (D10) or to extend like this?
K> your move is the correct direction of play - picture white playing here first, it would work very well with his wall in the lower right, and he would have a strong position on the bottom (lots of points).]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[ip]
(;B[hp]C[K> not good - there's a better way to strengthen your position, see variation]
;W[ho];B[dj]TR[ho]C[K> your move is certainly a big point, but the triangled stone is powerful against you]
;W[dm]C[[R\] Here it seems that I should have been able to drive his stone into the center, but I had difficulty doing so.  Was my attack flawed, or was my framework simply too weak?]
;B[dn];W[ck];B[cj];W[dk];B[ek]C[K> so far so good, but this move is inconsistent with you aim of forcing him into the centre, consider C7 instead]
;W[el];B[bk];W[cm];B[cn];W[en]C[K> still so far so good, although this hane is a strong move, consider E5 as your response]
;B[cl]C[K> ask yourself what this move achieves? for this move you have the choice of answering his hane e.g. at E5, or you can tenuki and get a big point elsewhere e.g. C16 (which makes you large moyo in top left difficult to invade). With this move you put yourself in gote and lost a ko threat]
;W[dl];B[bl];W[fk];B[ej];W[gl];B[eo]C[K> well I think that went OK actually; I think you lost an opportunity with C8 but even so kept white bottled in, protecting the lower left corner and upper left side just fine]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[ef];B[gf]C[K> very nice];W[fn];B[fh]C[K> B16 would be better - if white then tries to jump out to the centre, you are in a good position to cut across his jumps]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bd];W[bi];B[bj];W[ci];B[ce];W[be];B[bb]
;W[de]
(;B[cd]C[K> you didn't need to fill in here - although it looks as if you have a weak position you have A17 to fall back on, and putting a "spike" into white's eye space is more urgent e.g. B14]
;W[ae];B[ad];W[bg];B[id]C[K> white cannot easily invade here so this move is not necessary; to decide if an invasion is a threat try this rule of thumb: the invader must have a double threat, e.g. make life or connect out; choice of 2 directions to connect out; connect out or kill a group etc. This works on the theory that the defender cannot defend 2 things at once.

In this case, a white invasion would have only one option, to make life. He cannot connect along either edge, or run to the centre, or kill your groups.]

;W[gj];B[jl]TR[ik]C[K> right idea, wrong direction, should be L9. As it stands you will lose these stones and strengthen white in the process]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[il]
(;B[kl]C[[R\] I played here not wanting to let my stone go, but it ended up being captured anyway (along with many others).  Was there a better way to do this?
K> see earlier comment, and variation from here as another option (sacrificing the stones that are already doomed)]

;B[gs];W[br];B[ar];W[bs]TR[bq][eq]C[K> the key point in the white shape (which is called "bulky 5" - picture the points it enclosed when there is a white stone at F1) is D1, if you play there he is dead 

(in THIS case there are other moves you can make too due to being at the edge and the triangled stones not being part of the shape, making it weak, but in general D1 is the vital point)]

K> Overall you played pretty well. Your opponent seemed more aware of the weak spots in your shapes early on, maybe he'd read about a few tesuji's (although this tailed off later), but you came through it OK. You lost because of that big group in the lower right, but you know that already!

One thing it is worth doing is having a quick look at how the board ended up, and how the emergence of certain shapes during the game led to the position at the end. In particular, look at how centre-facing walls early in the game created territory later in the game (or not). High level players consider "influence" to be very important, but it is difficult for us beginners to see why while the game is unfolding. So a quick whizz through afterwards can make you see patterns that you didn't see at the time]
