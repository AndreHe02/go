AB[pd][dp]C[It's a 2 stone handicap game I thought I had won but it seems I played too weak and white manageg to get lead. Anyhow I lost by time.

>>> Hello. I left in your comments so you can see when I replied to something you said, but I took the liberty of deleting any chat that I felt wasn't relevent. My comments will be marked as are here.

>>>Now, for some general comments: Your feel for the opening is good, but it seems to me that you rely a bit too much on the joseki you know - try exploring variations on those and figuring out how to punish moves outside of joseki. Joseki are joseki because they're the best local moves for each side - this means that more often than not, a move out of joseki is a bad one. Your middle game and yose are both as good as can be expected for a 10k... My yose skills are pretty weak for my rank , so I can't say much about that. Finally, if you don't have it already, I'd reccommend that you pick up a copy of Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go". It's quite easy to read, and you're at about the ideal level to make your first read through it. It's a wonderful book, and it will last you a long time before you outgrow it - I know dan players who still read it.

>>>Overall, this was a very interesting game. I can see why you would like it reviewed.]
;W[dd];B[pq]C[>>>This is an interesting move. I don't see it too often in handicap games - most people I play against tend to play 4-4. That doesn't mean it's a bad move, though. My main complaint is that it seems to invite R5 sometime soon, but that can be dealt with pretty easily, and it certainly gives more solid territory than hoshi would. Also, you can get a Chinese style opening at r9 which would work well with your d4 stone if w doesn't make a move there. Finally, I see this more often when I watch dan-level handicap games so maybe there's something about this formation that I don't understand.

>>>Sorry for the essay, but I figured the move was neat so I'd comment.]
;W[fp];B[cn]C[>>>This is a good response - probably what I would do under the circumstances. W isn't in a good position to invade the corner, and at most can make a long knight's move or a two-space jump along the side and still be reasonably secure. From there, I'd probably aim at q9 or r9 to make a moyo.]

(;B[pj]TR[pd][on][pn]C[Can this extension be made at R11?

>>>More than "can". It should. R11 is nice because it helps balance high and low on the right - the marked stones are all high. As well, q10 is overconcentrated and it leaves the q14 area open to invasion. If you were to play r11, q14 or r14 would be much harder for w to pull off, since effectively, w would play into a pincer. See the variation for what R11 looks like and a few more details.

>>>It's very good that you saw it would be better to move there on your own. That shows me that you have an eye to making your formations as efficient as possible.]
;W[pf]
(;B[qf]C[Seems not the best way to answer.

>>> I think I'd go for an extension here - w is pretty much pincered by the q10 stone, even if it is a loose pincer. You can squeeze w's weak group between the top and bottom, and gain profit as you do.

>>>See the variations for details.];W[qc]C[>>>This is a move outside of joseki, which means it's probably bad. One of the characteristics of the on-space high pincer is that it leaves w in a poor position to invade the corner. See the variation for details.]

;W[op];B[mo];W[jp]C[B];B[cj]C[I had now a huge mogo below. Should I try harder to defend it?

>>> I'm not sure what you mean. However, because of n5, playing either at l6 or k6 is very urgent - w can push you up as follows in the variation, otherwise, and that would not be verygood. Perhaps it would have been better to play one of those before c10.]

(;B[lo]C[>>>This should definitely be at k6 - b has a nice thick wall, and m5 goes against the principle of playing away from thickness. Also, it encourages w to take the key point at k6 next. Your thinking is right, though - w does need to be enclosed.]
;W[jn]
(;B[km]C[>>>This should be at k8 or k9 to cap - l7 also goes against the principle of playing away from thickness. You're just encouraging w to run all over the centre, and since the group isn't weak, he'll damage your potential territory with every move.

>>>Incidentally, though not as urgent as responding to k6, a sansan invasion of the top left would be a good idea soon.]
;W[jm];B[kl];W[jh];B[lh]C[I really didn't know hoe to answer.

>>> You're again playing too close to your thickness. Carefully examine the board before this move. You have a good, thick game this far - where is w thin? 

>>>three points spring to mind almost immediately - the f12 area, k15 area, and the corner. Of those, I'd say that k15 would be the best at the moment - your influence from the left makes reducing the f12 area immediately a bit difficult, and sansan would give w a wall to use against k15. 

>>>After reducing there, go to sansan, and then see what you can do about the f12 area. After all that, w's top left should be far more manageable.

>>>When an opponent is building up some huge area, like w is in the top left, you have to think in terms of destroying as much of that territory as possible - m12 loosely surrounds maybe 13 points. With a move elsewhere, you can destroy far more of w's territory than 13 points, and then come back later maybe to play that.]
;W[kd]C[>>> now that k15 is impossible (and the alternatives in the area, l14 and k14, are far more difficult), I'd say go to sansan and try your luck with the f12 area, then if w hasn't plugged the hole at k14, try your luck there.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[md];W[ke];B[lf];W[dl];B[cl];W[cc]C[>>>f12 area reduction is very urgent now, and k18 is still a nice reduction for later. The key to the game is how much b can reduce w's top. right now.]

Incidentally, when w cuts, b must first atari at g10. Playing atari the other would would be a disaster for b.]
