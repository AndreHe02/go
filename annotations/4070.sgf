[ml][pl][lm][mm][lo]C[skish [20k\]: thank you, not mine tough

black has soo many cutting points!!! dont play to keep white contained when hes already escaped at the bottom. play at  A instead, this way you make a nice table shape which fixes your cutting points, and gives some to white.

;B[cn];W[fq];B[df]LB[bp:A][cq:B]TR[cn][hq]C[slide in at A instead of playing d14..... now you have three stones that are isolated

slide in at A forces black to defend the corner at b then you can attack the other corner if you wish.]
