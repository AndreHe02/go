LB[cp:A][fp:C][eq:B]C[Is this a joseki? I had difficulties trying to find an answer here. I think that A ,B and C are all weak. I chose A, but now I think that was wrong, although my opponent didn't see the chance.
JH : C is not good, B is the usual way but A is not bad at all]

JH : Both playable but I prefer A or "b"];W[cj];B[ej]LB[fc:a]
[pk:b]C[Is this correct? I had the feeling that white E10 would be big.
E10 will be a good move for White but I think 13 may be slow. May be "a" or "b" are usual]
;W[dk]C[It looks vulgar but I cannot say that White is bad after the sequence]

;B[dj]LB[cm:a][go:b]C[JH : This is clearly a bad move as you gain nothing from this atari. Should play at "a" or "b"]

Very good point];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[oq];W[rp];B[qo];W[qr];B[ro]

;W[km];B[mk]LB[nd:a]C[This looks slow. I agree with you to play the kikashi at "a" is a good play.]
