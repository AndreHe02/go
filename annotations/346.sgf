what i mean in this Go game. I will also try my best to write
in the better way, so that you can understang my English.   *I
hope you can give me your comment in every move i have made.]
;W[qn];B[ql]C[I think this is a best move i have make, is it? I learned it
from a 2 dan professional player.

Ziad: This is a correct Joseki move];W[qp];B[pq];W[qq];B[po]
C[Till here, everythings are just like what the teacher had mentioned
and i followed what he had taught me before.];W[pn]CR[rn]C[Everything went smoothly untill here. The white stone was put
at Q6, it is strange for me and i have no idea where to put my
stone. Can you give me some comment?

Ziad: I think w S6 is better. Your P6 is correct and later you
can play S5. See variation]
(;B[on];W[rm];B[qi]CR[jp]C[I don't think this is a good move, right? If i want to put in
this area, was it better for me to put it at Q11?
Or is there any best places for me to put at?

Ziad: I like to play R4 . I think R11 is small at this time]
;W[jc];B[lc]CR[jp]C[What do you think about this move? Bad, right?

Ziad:
 B M17 is ok I prefer R4];W[kb]CR[gc]C[Ziad:
G17 is better than L18];B[kc]C[Is ti more better for me to put it at M18?or somewhere else?

Ziad: L17 only helps W. Simply play M18 or play R4];W[lb];B[mb]
;W[jd]
(;B[ke]C[I think is also another bad move i have made.

Ziad:  I think you should solidify with N16. See variation]

(;W[iq];B[kp]CR[kq]C[I don't know where shall i put my stone, so i made a decision
to put my stone here. Am i right?

Ziad:
L4 should be at L3];W[kr];B[hq]CR[lq]C[Was it more better for me to put it at M2?

Ziad:
I would play B  M3 at this point];W[hp];B[ir];W[jq];B[gq]C[I think step 26 is a wrong step, am i right?

Ziad:
Once you played H3, G3 is a must.];W[mr];B[mq]CR[ol][fc][cj]
[mc]C[If my stone 26 put it at N2, was it more better? Because i have
loss the corner.

Ziad:
W N2 is small at this point.  Playing P8 is a better move at
this time. See other possible moves. You are trying to protect
an area that you already compromised.];W[nq];B[np];W[nr];B[oq]
C[This move was wasted, i think it is more better for me to put
at M3. What's your comment?

Ziad:
Yes P3 is bad M3 is a better move];W[lq];B[mp];W[io];B[jn];W[lp]

;B[co];W[dn];B[bp];W[an];B[fl]CR[mc][ib][gc]C[If step 58 put at B8, will it be more better?

Ziad: 58 at F8 is useless. W at C6 is alive. F8 should be at
G17 or connect at N17];W[fn];B[fp];W[ak]CR[qf][mc][gc][cf]C[Ziad:  W at A9 is and end game more. W should look at the moves marked
in red. I think w should play G17 first.];B[bj];W[gc]C[Ziad:
Finally!];B[fc];W[fd];B[ec]

;W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[de];B[bb]CR[dh][cg][fi]C[Was the stone put in the right way?
What do you think about the places like D13, E13, H8, and H15?

Ziad: You need to play C13 or F11];W[dh];B[ac];W[ae];B[bd];W[ce]
;B[ee]CR[mc][qd][ni][ol]C[Shall i put the stone at E16?

Ziad: Look at the rest of the board for better moves. Better
moves are P8, O11, N17, R16];W[ed];B[dc];W[fh]

group at D10. Leave these for KO threats. You should play E10]

put it at L16.

20 points at this time];W[sd];B[qf];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb];B[fa]

Ziad: yes, although you should have done then earlier.];W[ld]

So you should ignore J18 and play L15. You will have to lose

Thank you for the comment you have made!

Ziad: You need to solidify your groups and you should look at
the rest of the board before responding to white's moves. Evaluate
your groups's strength compare to adjacent white groups and make
sure you keep a good balance of power. Do not get attached to
loose useless stones. Use them rather than save them.  Playing
B11 would have saved your group at C10 and you would have won
by 20 points.  Good luck])
