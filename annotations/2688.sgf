RE[B+2.5]

C[Hi, i was playing black in this game and won by 2.5 points, it was a very close match.

I would appreciate that you could tell me what i did wrong and where i could improve, thank you very much.

My current rating is 11kyu in IGS.


This was good game to review in that I get the feeling that both players were playing well and it was a close score. Both players ignored some big points early in the game. W potentially had a good lead until you invaded on the left side. This was the crucial point in the game and w let you get a bigger position than he should have. His position was too open to kill you, but he needed to keep you smaller than he did. Your mistakes were earlier in having too much of a center of the board orientation. and being a little too cautious at various times. Good luck in the future.]
;B[pd]C[amoogye: hi];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp];B[pj]C[This is my favorite opening, i always like to play for influence rather than territory.

Me too.];W[eq];B[jj]LB[fc:A][jc:B][jd:C][fd:D][cj:E][jq:F]C[
I see better players than myself play this move in the opening from time to time, but it is not the best. It violates the principle of playing first in the corners, then the sides, and then developing into the center. Better moves would be any of A-F.]

You can play A here for a few more points];W[kd];B[ld];W[kc]
C[The joseki as far as i remember is m15 instead of l17, this seems better for me because i get to split white.

I don't know this joseki well, but it might be workable either way. Let's see what happens.]
;B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[ng];B[lh];W[jg]LB[lg:A]C[
W's corner stones are under attack, but he is building a nice wall to work with his upper left. It also becomes apparent that b's splitting attack is hurt by his weakness at A after this move of w's.]
;B[ph];W[og];B[pg];W[lg]C[This is where the fight begins... My only consolation is that the right side is secure and worth 20+points.

I agree.];B[kg];W[mg];B[kf];W[kh];B[li];W[jh];B[jf];W[hh];B[hf]

B has 2 eyes for his group as does w. W's side is a little bigger. The key point now is around A.]

;W[me];B[ja];W[nb];B[ka];W[ma];B[ia];W[ge]C[
Both sides are making endgame moves and avoiding the big points such as on the bottom. Later it becomes evident that w needs another move to make his corner secure.]
;B[hd];W[qn];B[rb]C[I thought i could kill the white group...

Hmm, maybe you can.];W[ni];B[nj];W[oj];B[mj];W[mi];B[lj]TR[li]
[lh]C[Maybe i should had played diffrently here.

I don't know. Your triangle stones just weren't strong enough to hold w in.]
;W[pi];B[ok];W[qi];B[oi];W[oh]C[And here i didnt wanted to risk the ko.

I am not as good as I should be on ko, but this looks like a much more risky ko for w than b. W's big life is at stake, whereas I think b will live even if he loses the ko.]
;B[oj];W[mh];B[ql];W[qp]
(;B[pn]LB[qq:A]C[
I would have played at A, attacking w by pushing him against your center thickness and at the same time making territory in the corner or along the bottom. You end up making a territory in the center which takes more stones and therefore is smaller.]

;W[hm]C[
B's next move is really the key point. W should have played near there. W's moyo is huge but it is a little too open.]

Yes it almost is already.];W[ch];B[dh]

You could have played A for a few more points but be careful.]

You don't need to. You could play A. Your groups on both sides of the w stones are much stronger than they are.]
