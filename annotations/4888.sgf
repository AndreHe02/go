C[I left some of the lines of chat that I thought were relevant in. They are seperated to keep things easy though. :\]

This game was a win for me, but is partially because of big mistake by white late in the game.

Thanks in advance for the review.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[nc]
;W[dk];B[qj]LB[po:B][qo:A]C[Would R9 have been better? Or maybe Q10 or Q9?

R9 gives white less room for an invasion, as it stands there is still room for a conventional approach at A or B which makes white's job of breaking up the right side fairly easy.]

(;W[np];B[qo]C[this is overly timid, Q5 is much better];W[kq]
;B[dg];W[cf];B[ci]C[Would C10 have worked?

No, that provokes white to respond at C9 which would solidify the lower left considerably.]
;W[co];B[fc]
(;W[ec];B[ff]C[white should have played to seperate the two black groups rather than take the corner.  With two weak side groups to care for it is unlikely black will have time to take advantage of the open corner.]

black must aim to attack the floating white stones, if he can solidify the center top and his fairly secure upper right while harassing the marked stones then the game will be well in hand for him.]

;W[mo];B[nn]C[this turns out to be a bad exchange for black.  Before this white had no large territory to match the huge black right side.  Plus, white has sente.]

;W[bm];B[cl]LB[fd:A]C[connecting is fairly small, there are plenty of larger moves on the board.  White would have to invest a second move at B9 to make the ko large enough to matter and the point at A, among others, is easily larger.]

This gives you a great opportunity to cut at M16 taking a lot of territory along the upper side.]

(;B[gk]LB[km:A][lm:B][lr:C]C[Instead of playing here, I was thinking maybe J19. I added a short variation to show what I was thinking.

Best of all is to leave it all alone to preserve the vague aji for a ko fight.  Also the cuts at A and B might have something to do with a fight that breaks out when black clamps at C, which is probably what you should do right now as it is a huge reducing move against white's only big territory.]
