C[Here Tim Pollio and I, both VT go club members, play a friendly game. He is much better at fighting than me and Im slightly better thanhim at the opening and joseki, so hes probably a couple of ranks higher overall. Thanks for the review, 

-Richard

k-san: you're welcome! let's begin.];B[pd];W[dc]C[Jihad [7k\]: ultra wow]
;B[pq];W[ep];B[qk];W[co]TR[cp][fq]C[k-san: a minor gripe, having the large knight's enclosure is faster, but this is still fine.]
;B[ci];W[cg]LB[cf:A]C[k-san: w overextended here. A makes a normal enclosure, and b has no room to extend up there.]
;B[cl];W[bm]LB[bj:B][bk:A]C[k-san: ick.  always a or b.];B[cm]
LB[ei:A]C[k-san: b is only helping w here, by adding more stones in the corner, and making himself heavier. instead,  A would be a nice and light jump out.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[cn]C[k-san: b is feeling uncomfortable now.]
;B[ce]LB[df:A]C[Is this a bad thing, I think I need to keep white from attacking my left side group too effectively or atleast make it an even fight

k-san: yeah, definitely a bad thing. this is simply an overplay. but how should w punish?  i think the kosumi at a will do.

(this is a big turning point.)];W[bh]C[k-san: i'm concerned about this. i think he should kosumi immediately.]
;B[bi];W[df];B[de]C[k-san: this isn't a good result for w, he's getting himself into trouble.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[dd];B[ef];W[fe];B[bc];W[eg]LB[fd:A]C[k-san: w has to play f16 (A).]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[ff];W[ge];B[fg];W[eh]LB[fh:A]C[k-san: what about the double hane at a?]
;B[fj];W[fh];B[hf];W[gh]LB[hg:A]C[k-san: a is stronger move for w.]
;B[hg];W[gc]LB[id:A]C[k-san: this is really slow. j16.];B[hi]
LB[hj:A]C[k-san: a is better connectivity for the weak group on the left side,]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[dj];B[dk];W[cj];B[ck];W[hh];B[ih]C[I try too hard to keep the pressure on white, is there a better way?

k-san: not really, w can now try to settle by getting something of the upper left corner if neccessary.]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[gf];B[gg];W[ig];B[if];W[jh];B[kf]C[k-san: the hunter becomes the hunted. although w had to flail around, he still came out punishing the overplay.  b's going to have a very rough time from here.]
;W[fk];B[fm];W[jq];B[ic]
(;W[id]C[k-san: l17 is a stronger invasion. w is only helping b here.]
;B[jd];W[ie];B[je]C[k-san: now b has a much bigger top right.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib]C[k-san: more free moves for b. he's extremely happy.]
;B[cb]LB[oj:A]C[k-san: corner's too small, a's a really big move.]
;W[po]C[k-san: b/c of k3, this is easier to play now, but it's still not too comfortable for w.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[oq]C[k-san: s2 is the only move here.];W[qm];B[ol]C[k-san: s8 instead. always remove the base first. since p3 was played instead, now w isn't open on both sides.]
;W[rr]C[k-san: huge move for w locally.];B[pf]C[k-san: good move.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[k-san: hm....what about hane from the outside (p17?)]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[oc]
(;B[od]C[k-san: this only helps w. b needs to remove the base.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[nc];W[md];B[nb];W[oe];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng]
;W[mg];B[kh]C[bad move? , N12 or )12 maybe better? I was trying to lean and then attack here.

k-san: i agree with your thinking here. kudos^^];W[nh];B[ph]
;W[mb];B[mc];W[lc];B[lb];W[ob];B[ma];W[qd];B[pe];W[qb];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[rd]C[k-san: b forgot the p19 exchange.];W[pa];B[mh]
C[k-san: an overplay. it's easier to peep with m12, then keep attacking, b/c it's really hard for w to pull out.]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[kg];B[ki];W[jg];B[li];W[lg];B[na];W[oa];B[ka]
C[Jihad [7k\]: oops];W[nn]C[k-san: g9 is looking pretty good right now instead, should keep k14 in mind.]
;B[jf]C[Stones [6k\]: LOL];W[pr]C[k-san: very painful for w now if he doesn't switch to the center dragon.]
;B[or];W[qs];B[ij]C[k-san: g9's a big move locally, but that bottom right group is extremely weak now.]

Stones [6k\]: great time to start thinking =)
Jihad [7k\]: yeah really

k-san: no cut. n8 is so important.];W[cd]C[Jihad [7k\]: oops]

;W[ip]LB[gp:A]C[k-san: i think crosccutting at g4 is easier to play than j4.]
;B[gp];W[hr];B[gr];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[jp]C[k-san: odd move. would prefer j5.]
;W[io]C[k-san: what about m3 first? this opens up some bad aji with b's keima  at n4, etc.]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[lq];W[mq];B[mp];W[js]C[should I make him live in gote by connecting to G4?]

;B[eq];W[dp];B[ls];W[ir];B[hs];W[fq];B[fr];W[ho];B[hm];W[gs]
;B[fs];W[ds]C[k-san: ah well.

i think the big turning point that started everything was the left side, first came out heavily with the splitting invasion, then the overplay caused a very messy problem for b. later, the invasion in the upper right was important. but in short, it was the fighting that was the focus of the game here.

hope you two found this helpful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  thanks!
