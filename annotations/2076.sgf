C[Michael S. Taylor, 28 Oct 2003.  Approx. 25-20k?  Have only played a few 19x19 games.  Working through "Learn To Play Go II (Moving Horse)" and Iwamoto's "Go for Beginners.".

This game is me (black)  against Goban v57 computer program (white) for Macintosh, on easiest computer setting.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A general comment on the entire game:
White didn't play very strong or consistent.  Black got beaten mainly by his own mistakes and not enough reading and counting of liberties.
You should go more for tempo and influence in the opening, and play a bit more solid and conservative in the middle game.

I am sure that if you take the time to THINK you'll beat the program at this level every time; you don't need to learn anything new, just use what you already know.  Keep it simple!

Two rules of thumb:
Attack from a distance, defend with contact moves.
Make a base for your stones before attacking.

Your strongest moves are more than good enough to beat white in this match, what you need to do is weed out the worst mistakes. Keep it up!]
;B[pd]C[Standard opening

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Standard joseki yes.  But remember that the hoshi opening gies you influence but no real territory without two more stones in the corner.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo]TR[qn][po]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I liked the marked spots better than R5.  I have also seen offensive players go directly to D10 this early, separating the enemy corners.]
;W[qf]TR[qe]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Another possible response.  White Q14 is then to be expected, and then it's urgent for black to play Q15.]

(;B[nc]C[Originally played O16, but decided to play Knight's Move at O17 instead. This may have been a mistake, because white originally played over on the left side of the board, but played S16 in response to my O17.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Generally I have the impression it's right to play "symmetrical" to the enemy's approach.  -Unless you make the contact move at R15.-]
;W[rd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
S16 is joseki.];B[jp]TR[cn][de][qc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
R17 is joseki.
C6 or D16 would have been good sente moves here.];W[de];B[fq]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This invites white to reinforce on the upper side of the corner stone, more or less staking out the entire left side.  Black gains less than he helps white to gain.]
;W[jc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
With the semi-solid wall in the corner white can make this fairly strong extension, building territory.]
;B[pj]TR[qi][dj][dr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I've marked a few moves that are better than Q10.  Black needs to gain sente and tempo, black needs to enlagre his bases.  I think Q10 isn't expansive enough.]
;W[of];B[pf]TR[dr][pg][qc]C[I'm not sure what to do here, and where my game begins to break down.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Q15 feels pointless, I'm sorry to say.
R17 would give black a base to live in the corner.
D2 is joseki, eating away at the corner.
Q13 threatens to cut, and white Q14 is to be expected.  Then black R13 would give a good and solid extension from Q10.]
;W[pg];B[pe];W[dn];B[og];W[oh];B[oe]TR[ng]MA[ph][qg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Protect the cutting stone.  No doubt, play O13 here.
You could have to nice future cuts waiting for you.];W[ng];B[dj]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White has reinforced both the left corners, so D10 doesn't really have much impact now.  White can afford to ignore it.]
;W[oo]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
...and he does.];B[po]TR[np][pn][pm][jj][mm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Q5 does not "feel right".  Of the top of my head I've spread a few suggestions.  I think O4 and Q7 are the most sensible. N7 and Tengen are long-term investments preparing to kill P5 and friends in the future.]
;W[ch]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White works to take away the base from D10, extending from the corner at the same time.  A very good, strong move.]
;B[dh]TR[cl][ci]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
D12 doesn't really achieve anything useful.
PLaying on the third line would make more sense.];W[dg];B[ci]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Black now has 3 very weak stones.];W[eh];B[di];W[mo];B[mp]TR[lm]
[mq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Attack from a distance, defend with contact moves.  In this corner black is safe, white is the weak intruder.]
;W[np];B[op]TR[mq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
N3 is better.];W[nq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Black has now actually HELPED white weaken his position.];B[nr]
TR[mq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
N3 IS better.];W[mr];B[lq];W[on]C[For the past few moves in this corner, I thought perhaps I was doing OK, but after more reading and reviewing this game, I realize that I don't have a strong base to guard the lower part of the board.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
You HAD a good base.  But you helped white break it up.  You should not have played contact moves so soon.  It would have been better to attack from a distance on the outside, and droven white into the wall.]
;B[pl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Q8 is too small.  Q7 would be correct.
Atari on C13 or doing something else about the upper left corner would have been good.]
;W[or];B[lr];W[qi];B[oi]TR[qj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Stop white from eating away at your base!];W[go];B[hp];W[bg]
;B[bh]TR[dr][id][ed]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A few better alternatives!];W[cg];B[bi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This has helped white reinforce his position and left him with sente.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[er];B[gp];W[nl];B[om];W[nm];B[pn]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White has ended up with a stronger position and can push towards black as we've seen the last few moves.]
;W[ld]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
DANGER!  Now black has to make a base for the group on top, or decide to give up on it.]
;B[nn];W[mb];B[no]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White has just exchanged two small stones for a large area on the top with many dead black stones in it.]
;W[ob];B[oc];W[pb];B[nb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Trying to keep the group alive now is probably futile.];W[kb]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[pi];W[km];B[kn];W[ni];B[nk]TR[cm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
The last few moves looks as if black is a bit lost or without any plan.  Extending from the wall towards the corner could have been better.]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[mj];B[ok]C[T];W[gi];B[fi];W[fh];B[gh];W[hi];B[jj]
;W[gg];B[hh];W[ih];B[hg];W[ik];B[ij]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White is getting a good grip of the centre.  The black stones are spread and without support.  At this point white is about 70 points ahead.]
;W[hj];B[jk];W[gf];B[hk];W[il];B[gj];W[ii];B[jm]TR[fk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Secure the cutting-points, try to make life for the group on the left.]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[lm];B[mn];W[gk];B[fj]C[H];W[bk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Too late.  White moves in for the kill.];B[hl]C[For this series of plays, I was trying to trap his central white pieces.]
;W[im];B[hm]TR[gl]C[Had you played atari instead you might have saved your left group.]
;W[jn]TR[fl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Capture the white stone in a net.];B[ln];W[fl];B[ml];W[kk];B[ll]
;W[hn];B[ho];W[mm];B[jo];W[fo]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White is now more than 100 points ahead.
The left group might still be saved, all the central black stones are dead.]
;B[gn];W[in];B[io];W[lk]C[I didn't see that coming at all.  Oops.  It's also quite obvious that he's controlling the entire upper part of the board.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Count your liberties.  And abandon dead or hopeless groups.]
;B[ll]TR[qj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
What the **** is the point of suicide on M8???
R10 at least makes sense.];W[rj];B[ph];W[nf];B[qg];W[og];B[qe]
;W[rf];B[rg]TR[re]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
S15 is a lot better.];W[re];B[pk]C[I'm still obviously weak playing along the edge.  THis was a desperation move to try to strengthen my position in the lower right side.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
It did strengthen your stones, but is redundant.  Atari on R10 followed by S9 is better.]
;W[sg];B[mh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Suicide.];W[mi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
At this point it looks like black has a large corner in the lower right, all the rest is white.  White leads with perhaps 140 points.
The black group on the left MIGHT still be saved.];B[li]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Another suicide.];W[fr];B[gr];W[gs];B[hs];W[rl];B[rm];W[sm]
;B[rn];W[qj];B[rk]TR[fs]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
S9 is nonsense.
Kill G1.];W[qk];B[qm];W[sn];B[ro]TR[so]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Atari is better.];W[so];B[sp];W[sl];B[rp];W[ql]C[And so much for my control of the lower right side.]
;B[pm]TR[fs][eq]C[A wasted move, again from desperation.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Better to kill G1 or press at E3.];W[eq];B[ek];W[fn];B[gm]TR[cm]
C[Abandon the dead stones.  Tro and save the group on the edge.]
;W[ig];B[if]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This achieves nothing.];W[fs];B[hq]TR[hr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
H2 is better.];W[fp];B[hr];W[nh];B[ji];W[jg];B[kh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Here you're only giving away prisoners.];W[gq];B[kf];W[fq];B[je]
;W[hd];B[lg]TR[hf];W[ol];B[ki];W[kd];B[ke];W[hf]C[Another move I didn't see coming,]
;B[ie];W[he];B[id];W[ic];B[mc];W[lb];B[lc];W[na];B[lf];W[le]
;B[kg];W[mg];B[ne];W[me];B[ag]TR[cl][cm]C[Try to get some territory on the lower left side.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Better try to make a base and live.
The recent exchange of stones in the centre has been pointless from black's point of view.]
;W[af];B[ah];W[bf];B[ei];W[dl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White makes sure the black group will die.];B[dm]C[I have no idea how to proceed.]
;W[bl];B[cl];W[cm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Nasty double atari.];B[dk];W[el]
(;B[fk]C[Originally played G8 but white played F7 and I lost group.  Caught me by surprise, so used Undo and played F9 instead.  Poor form but computers are soooo forgiving when you're a beginner. <grin>

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
But how / where should you make the second eye?];W[gl];B[ck]
;W[bj]C[Failed to get my second eye.  I've since learned how to tell if I control an eye or not.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
That group has been impossible to save for some moves now.]

;B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[ec];B[jb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Not much sensible to say as comments.  White keeps on securing his already strong position.  Black's stones doesn't really count as attacks.]
;W[ib];B[gb];W[fb];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[ia];B[ja];W[ka]C[Finally accepted that rest of game was futile and resigned.  Only place I have territory that I believe I can maintain is lower right corner.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Right.  White is almost 200 points ahead.])
