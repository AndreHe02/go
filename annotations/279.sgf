C[Commented by Rafael Caetano dos Santos, rafa 9k* IGS.

Rafael requested comments on his own comments. Those are
provided by Erik Ekholm (EE), Swedish 3 dan.];B[dp];W[pq];B[dd]
;W[qd];B[nc]C[This move is not incorrect per se, but it is usually played in special situations.
I'm not strong enough to tell you which situations, but I guess the current
position is not one of them.  It gives W the opportunity of enclosing the corner.

This approach is not very common nowadays, and it may be simpler to play the
one-point approach at P16, or P17.

Not a big deal, though.

EE: I agree with the comment, but feel that on this level, it could be seen
as a matter of personal style.];W[oc]C[This helps B.  It is simpler and safer to play the kosumi at Q17.

EE: Yes, it encourages Black to make thickness towards the left, which
works well together with his two starpoint stones to make a big framework.]
;B[ne]C[Extending at o16 is better.

EE: Yes.];W[oe];B[db]C[Your stones at the top right are a bit weak, so you should take care of them
before switching to another part of the board.   Forcing at P16, W Q16, B O16,
followed by W defending one of the cutting points, and B extending to K16,
may be satisfactory.

Besides, D18 is too defensive a move. You should bear in mind that a stone
at the 4-4 point is not intended to take (immediate) territory. You should
use it to take influence in the center.  This is not a simple matter, though.

EE: I couldn't have put it better myself!];W[ic];B[kc];W[fc]
;B[gd]C[This sequence strenghtens W, and so weakens B at the right.
A general principle: play from the weaker side.

EE: If White answers G17 and Black plays J16, it might work
out allright, with Black getting some kind af wall towards the centre.
But perhaps that is too complicated.];W[gc];B[fd];W[ec]C[EE: H16 is an urgent shape point for both.]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[cc];W[eb]
(;B[cj]C[This point is big, but the situation at the top is urgent.  The B group at the top left now has 2 cutting points.
You could link at C18, threating the W group, which is not alive yet.
This would also protect against the cut at C16.

Or maybe running with the group at the right.

EE: C18 looks better than C16 since the former keeps White insecure, but H16 is still
a good point (see variation).];W[cb];B[cd]C[If you can, force before defending.  In this case, B18, then W captures, and B links
at C16.

EE: Good advice!];W[bb];B[id]C[Good, trying to link up your groups. But note that W could break through at K16.]
;W[dg]C[This is dubious, since it is too near the strenght of the B group above, and it is
pincered by the B stone at C10.  It has little space to make eyes, and it doesnt have
W influence to back it up when it tries to run away.

EE: Yes, it poses no threat to the Black wall. Try to play moves that affect
the strength and weaknesses of groups already on the board. White should continue
the contact fight above at K16 or reduce at E10 to keep the moyo from getting
too big.];B[cg]C[You should grap the opportunity and attack the lone W stone.   I think this is not to the best way to do it.  Maybe the knight move at E11
would be better.   Another general principal: when attacking, you should avoid playing
contact moves, since they usually end up strenghtening the enemy.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[The cross-cut leads to complications. In this case, B can afford to cross cut, since
there is a strong wall above to back up, and the stone at C10.   Even so, it would
be enough to draw back at C12.

EE: Cutting helps White making shape. Pulling back is the correct move.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[di]C[EE: White should force with E14. When Black pulls back to D15,
he makes TWO empty triangles.];B[bf]C[Unnecessary.  C10 is alone, so B should link it up with the group above by
playing B12.];W[ef]C[EE: Good.];B[de];W[eh]C[Although W invasion was a bit premature, W is fairly good now.

EE: Yes, Black's moves ended up too close to the wall to be efficient.]
;B[bh];W[ci];B[dj]C[Just link it: B11.  Then W could play a severe move: D10, but at least your groups
would be connected.

EE: B10 would also connect, and then D10 would be less severe on Black.]
;W[bi];B[ei]C[You are trying too hard to kill W.

EE: Yes, overplays.];W[bj];B[bk]C[Now there are 2 cutting points, C9 and E10.

EE: C8 or E10 would be normal shape.];W[ej];B[fi];W[dk]C[EE: This helps Black to protect a cutting point. Better just extend to E9
or cut directly at C9. The latter will be the quickest way for White to take
care of the weak group.];B[ck];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hh]C[Another overplay, another cutting point (h11).

EE: Probably, but White will have to play carefully to keep his
group out of trouble.];W[hg];B[ek]C[EE: J12 would be quite severe.]
;W[ih]C[See?  B gave W the chance to play this atari.];B[hi]
;W[if];B[jc];W[ib];B[je]C[Good. Very important move, keeping your groups connected.]
;W[qn];B[kp]C[Big.
But you still should play at the upper right corner.  You could even keep sente.

EE: It is not unusual to see contact fights like the one at the top
left unresolved for many moves in games with weaker kyu players. The one
who playes there next will get a local advantage.];W[of];B[nf]
;W[oh]C[Now W is forming a big territory at the right side.]
;B[nh]C[EE: Black seems to be staking everything on attacking the white group
on the left.];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[gf];W[hf]C[This is a bit awkard, but it threatens H15.

EE: This is a fundamental mistake. Black can and should cut off and kill the left
part of White's group. H15 is no real threat. White should have
played G13.];B[ii]C[You should cut at G13!
Then W could play H15, B G15, W H16 cutting B groups and linking his, but
both B groups live, and W group at G12 dies.];W[ji];B[lh];W[lg]
;B[mg];W[le];B[lf];W[kf];B[ke];W[mf];B[ld];W[ge]C[B loses the chance to cut.]
;B[he];W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[fe]C[The capture is very small itself.  B can only play this way if it is to kill
the W group. But this is a bit hard, since that group is out in the center.

EE: Well, the difference between a white capture and a black is a
completely alive group versus a totally eyeless gorup, so it is more at
stake than just the 7 points. Black doesn't have to kill the White
group to justify this move. If he can successfully attack it while securing
territory below, or gaining strength to invade the right white side and destroy
the territory there, it doesn't matter if the white group lives in the end.
That is not to say that Black couldn't adopt the strategy of playing from the
outside and *threaten* to play F15 later.];W[jj]
(;B[fk]C[Unnecessary.  The W stone at E10 cannot escape.  If you are worried
about the group at e11, it would be better to play something like H9.

EE: Well, the escape is actually a tricky affair (see variations). H9
looks more efficient, but it might actually be the case that the slow
capture at F10 is honte (the proper move). I would probably attack White
around K8 and hope to patch up the defects in the course of the fight.]
;W[dm]C[Unreasonable.];B[dl]C[Unnecessary.   Think what W could do if you had ignored D7. Would
W link at D8?  The B stones at D10 are linked anyway, so linking would be useless for W.

EE: Yes, Cutting stones are important, and those who don't cut aren't. Although D9
helps to make E10 a false eye, the chance that that will be of
importance is small.];W[fq]
(;B[hq];W[fo];B[em]C[You should care about D4.

EE: Yes, play away from thickness.];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co]
;W[dr];B[bo]C[This position is a bit complicated (for me) because of the surrounding W stones.
Even so, I think it is best to play the  "traditional" E2, keeping W split.

EE: Agree.];W[eq];B[eo];W[ep];B[do]C[W gained substantial territory in sente.]
;W[il];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[kl];B[jm];W[lk];B[kh];W[jh];B[oi]
;W[ph];B[on];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[mi];B[mh]C[Wrong.  B should give away 2 stones, and connect at O11 to save the stones
around P9.

EE: Don't forget that the big white group is lacking eyes. It is
probably weaker then P9 is. And Black is so far behind that he now has to
try to kill it. Thus, I would also play N12.];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj]

(;B[li]C[EE: Wrong direction. White can't make two eyes here anyway. See variation!]
;W[lj];B[pi];W[ki];B[ng];W[pj];B[oj];W[mm];B[lm]C[Better force at Q5 and attach at P3.]
;W[ll];B[nm];W[mn];B[qi];W[qh];B[km]C[The situation hereafter is a bit complex for me to comment, and both
sides made mistakes, but suffice to say that B's mistake was letting W cut its groups apart
at O11.   B could even steal the second eye of the big W group in the center, but its group at P10
does not have an eye, so B would probably lose the semeai (capturing race).

EE: Yes, this is an overplay. Black must first take care of his cut-off group.]
;W[np]C[EE: Now Black's game is beyond salvation. (No more comments by me)]
