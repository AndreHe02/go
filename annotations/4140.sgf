C[Thanks in advance for the review.
I'm playing black (jms) and am about 16k KGS.

(;W[bc];B[eb];W[cb];B[id]C[Question: Was this an even exchange?

Was it better for black, because of the thickness?

mite> Certainly it's better for black, even if open E16 slightly weakens the group a little. White played the corner in a bad way which led to this, see variations earlier.

Is there a better move than J16 to capitalize on the influence?

mite> It's hard to say so early which move is the best. All I can say is J16 looks effective.]

(;B[ql]C[mite> There's something about this move I don't agree with but it maybe just my personal feelings. It's low (3rd line), not influencing much, it's far from R4 which is still vulnerable with O4's position and it's on the wrong side, considering top-right corner is only taken by 1 stone whereas bottom right has 3.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[oq]C[I was unsure how to respond to this move.  I decided to seal him in with P4, but I also considered Q3 and O3. Would either of those have been better?

mite> I think you chose well, you'll build your right side, keep options open to the left, and your to-be strong right side will help in reducing W on the same side.]

(;B[ni]C[This seemed like a prety big move -- but what about a cap at P11 instead?

mite> Ah yes, expand and reduce at the same time, plus if white were to take this spot it would be a ladder breaker to J14. Good thinking. As for P11, W on the side already lives with ease and there aren't territory-wise moves for him left  there, in that sense I think P11 is useless and O11 perhaps captures a few more points from the center.

mite> Another good move might be S10, at the risk of getting less in the center but as we know, it's hard to make a big center anyway.]
