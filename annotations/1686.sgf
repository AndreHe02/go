Thank you to rewiew my game.

FR: 
Hi "PO"
You played and interesting game. The main point in this game was the attack on the J4 black group, so I'll focus on that. It's hard to say how strong you are, based on one game, but you surely look much stronger than 24k]

(;W[qn]C[FR: Nothing abnormal up till now. Here I would suggest the other side (O3). See variation]
;B[ql]
(;W[on]C[FR: Jumping in the corner might be better. In the game you are chased in the centre without base.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[mq]C[FR: not good, better attack the two white stones]
;W[lp];B[rp];W[pl]C[FR: Better M6 to connect];B[pk];W[mn]C[FR: Good !]
;B[cn];W[do];B[dn];W[fo]C[FR: You asked about this move. The idea is good, the only drawback is maybe the weak point at E4]

(;B[ip]C[FR: You cannot "prevent" this move. It seems a bit of an overplay because he's invading deep in your moyo. The question thus becomes: how can I punish him for this overplay ?

Let's have a look at some possibilities (variations)
There are many more possibilities, but I hope you get the idea of how you can take advantage of a situatation like this]

(;W[jo]C[FR: A good start !];B[io];W[jn]C[FR: But this is to soft for black. This way he can easily escape]
;B[in];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[el];W[fl]C[FR: The idea to strenghten your left side, so you can better attack the three black stones, is very good (I suppose this was your idea playing  these moves)]
;B[im];W[kl]C[FR: OK: continue the attack];B[ik];W[di];B[ci]
;W[ej];B[dk]
(;W[ek]C[FR: This move is not really necessary. You could attack right now on J11 (see variation)]
;B[ii]
(;W[cj]C[FR: Not the best point to harass these stones];B[ck]
;W[ch];B[bj];W[dg];B[bh];W[hj];B[ij];W[id]C[FR: This  "leaning" attack on the upperside black group is again a very good idea: get some white stones over there to better attack the centre black stones.
You could also attack the group by moves like K18 or E18, but then black would run into the centre and connest with his other stones.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[hb];W[he];B[gd];W[ge];B[jd];W[ie];B[jc];W[kf]
C[FR: Very good up till now.];B[jb]
(;W[lc]C[FR: But now is the moment to attack the centre black stones. Your white stones in the right upper corner won't die and because of the K18 stone, you won't make much territory on the upper side. See variation]
;B[kj];W[oh]C[FR: This is not sente, because black is very strong on the right side. Better split at N10]
;B[nj];W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[oi];W[lh];B[kk];W[ll];B[mj]C[FR: Now black is conected for sure. You played the end game rather well and without the blunder later on the difference would have been about ten points.

You couldn't keep your territory on the lower side. This is no problem if you know how to attack the invader and take the profit in the process of doing so.]
