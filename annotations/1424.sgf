;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[cn]TR[dc][pq]C[There's nothing wrong with this black move, though it's generally accepted that to approach "unfinished corners", in this case top left and bottom right, is better than approaching corners with 4-4 and 3-3 stones, which have miai. White in this case don't mind taking F3 or C6, since locally it's of same value.]

(;W[gp]LB[ep:1][fp:2]TR[gp][pq]SQ[cl][fq]C[Please notice how Q3 is "low" on bottom. White don't really have much growth potential on bottom with Q3 being there, and so 3rd line is much better. Besides, a 2 space extension here just leave a weakness that can be exposed later by black. If white want's to play on bottom, F3 is much better in this case. I would prefer the pinch at c8 idea my self  (see in variation)]

(;B[jq]C[Black should just leave the weakness in white's shape to attack later and settle the C6 stones first.]
;W[cl];B[en]C[This move just gives white a target to attack.]
;W[ci];B[ce]TR[cn]C[This is an overplay by black. Avoid having 2 weak group on board.]
;W[gc]C[This move is too weak. White should attack  the C15 stone aggresively, as it's cramped and hard to settle. Diagonal move at E16 is better.]
;B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[cg];W[nc]LB[cd:A][ci:B][cn:C]C[This move is wrong and put "Big before urgent". (Proverb says : "urgent before big") 

Black A group is now strong, and so weakened white's B group. By attacking white's B group, Black's C group will be strengthened, and then Black can attack lower left corner. A rough illustration is enclosed.]

(;B[ic]C[This feels like an overplay by black.];W[kc];B[ie]
C[This is a mistake by black, as white can connect 2 weak group (look at variation). Black should play K16 instead, which will prevent the connection.]

(;W[pc]C[This white move is wrong for several reason. First, this move helps black by settling Q16. Second, C8 group and corner  group is still weak and urgently need to be fixed.]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[od];B[pe]C[Black got profit from white's mistake.]
;W[po]C[Still, i feel defending C8 group is better. One way is to play E8, defense and attack at same time.]

(;B[qo]C[A better idea for black here is to pinch at Q8. Look at variation. This move just help white to settle.]
;W[qn];B[ro]C[Black should draw back instead of this.];W[rn]
;B[qp];W[qj];B[qh]C[White is happy to settle in black's area of influence.]
;W[nq]C[This feels like overplay. Too cutable. Again, the issue on the board is to defend white's weak group.]
;B[lp]C[Cutting white's O3 by playing P4 or P5 seems possible and better]
;W[no];B[hq];W[gq]C[This is mistake by black, helping white to settle.]
;B[bp];W[cq]C[And more mistake by black];B[bq];W[cr]C[White should B2 here i think. More eye shape for white and less for black.]
;B[hp]C[This is a bad move as it serves no purpose, and just make k3 group heavier.]
;W[og];B[pg]LB[gc:B][ci:A]C[White's intention is to make a big moyo on top, and swallow the top black 2 stones as whole. Moyo however don't really work well when one have a weak group to take care of, as opponent can chase the weak group into ur moyo and completely ruin it. So moyo strategy is quite risky to take in this case.

With black having weak group on board, it's hard to predict the outcome of this strategy. However, there are somethings that white must look at :

1. Weakness of group A. Black can use this to give chase and enter white's moyo.

2. B group is not completely safe. We deduced earlier that it's safe for that time since white can connect under to L17 group. But in making this connection, black will make living shape on top, and thus forces white to take the center. However, again, by chasing A group, black can enter the center.

3. The moyo still has hole on the left side and right side.]
;W[of]C[To illustrate the points i've mentioned earlier, what would u have done if black has played D14? (look at variation)]

(;B[pf];W[jk]C[After looking at the variation earlier, this move is kinda futile. It defines no territory at all.]
;B[jn];W[ge]C[G14 seems possible here];B[ig];W[ii]C[When attacking,  the direction where opponent wants to run to which is more profitable to u. In this case, black don't want to run to bottom. So this feels wrong]
;B[gg]C[This feels like leaving too many cuts for white to use. Contact move like G14 seems  better.]
;W[dg]C[This following sequence is really bad for white.];B[dh]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[df];B[ch];W[di]C[Now white feels the need to defend C11, but it's a bit late]
;B[eh];W[el];B[go]
(;W[fo]C[This move is a thank you move. White is helping black fixing his shape. Look at variation]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[dn];W[ei];B[fh];W[dl]C[This just make the group heavier and don't improve the eye shape.connecting the 2 group with G10 seems better]
;B[fl];W[km];B[kn];W[ln];B[fi];W[bh];B[bj];W[bi];B[bl];W[cj]
C[This is wrong. White looks dead. White must not let B8 connect. White's only move seems to be B7. Look at variation at white's loss if black connected at B9.]

(;B[bm]C[Black failed to punish.];W[bk];B[or]C[Area of concern for white now is top left. White should cut Black at  C13 (threatening to B15), and then underconnect G17 with L17. The following few moves are bad.]
;W[oq];B[nr]SQ[oi]C[White's potential area is around Q8. Protect this with P11.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[lq];B[kq];W[oo];B[oh];W[oe];B[oj];W[mj]C[Again this move is nothing.]
;B[ol];W[ql];B[om];W[ml]C[I will end the review here as there's not any specific question from the player, and i feel much of the game focus is reached at this point. If there's any specific questions, please contact me at my email (available at my info in GTL)

As a parting note, i will share this tip i got from my teacher:
"Before making each move, ask yourself this 3 questions:
1. Am i okay? (Is all my group healthy?), if not, fix.
2. Is he okay? (Does my opponent have weakness i can attack in profit)
3. If both is ok, where is big point on the board?"

I hope this short review is helpful to any of u reading this.]
