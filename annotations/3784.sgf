AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I'm your reviewer for this game. I'll try my best to point out significant issues without berating you :D.

I'm XCMeijin on te KGS server, but i'm not on nowadays, due to lots of crappy schoolwork (yeah, i'm still in school: i'm only 13k on KGS tho). If you see me, feel free to ask questions.

I'll be replying to your questions by beginning with "XCM:..." so you'll know where to look.

Have a nice day.];W[qf];B[pf]C[Here is the right first move?

What should I have done here?

Could be a answer in san-san?

XCM: White at san-san now wouldn't be so good. You'll be helping black build up his central inluence. I've included an example.

See how he's got 2 handicap stones already at hoshi? As you may know, the fourth line is also known as the "line of power". I would actually be more inclined to play R14 at Q14. You can find josekis for this around the place in your free time.

The point is: influence is a major factor when early into the game. Don't give it up so easily.]

(;W[qd];B[mc]C[After this, i tried to claim the upper right corner.

XCM: By all means, go for it. But let's take a look at the situation now.

N17 is nice for black. As it's on the 3rd line, we could assume to some degree that he want 3rd line territory. Had it been on N16 (the power line) we could assume otherwise, that he wants influence. but either way, the corner is small cookies for him.

This is the kind of analysis you need to make during games. "Oh, 4th line? He's looking for this...No, 3rd line, he wants this instead..." Get into the mind of your opponent, don't just play against the shapes o the board.

Back to your question: Taking the corner isn't bad, and it actually gives yor white stones a base. However, it does give black another chance to build up influence. So, in the end, it's up to you to choose the lesser of two evils.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[oe];W[qe]C[XCM: Hmm, nice that you get big corner. Black's influence is intimidating though...]
;B[pj]C[XCM: Ha! He really is showing us his plans. (You stare blankly at me). Ok, ok, let me explain...

If black was playing with a territorial mindset, he would have played in the vicinity of H16. With the black wall around P14 facing the north, that would provided him with loads of territory.

Instead, black has chosed to extend in the (theoretically) wrong way. Look closer, and you'l see that Q10 is on the 4th line. AND it's on the side that white is on so far.

What does this mean? He wants to block white from the centre, and grab heaps of centre influence to boot.

Hey, don't sweat it, you'll learn to think like I do when you get stronger :D.]

(;W[fq]C[XCM: At this stage i would probably prefer a 4th line joseki, to kill off some of his central inflence. I've enclosed an example.]
;B[fp]C[Again, I tried to put some pressure in White here. But i don't know if it worked out.

XCM: There's another joseki here you could've used to run to the centre. I've enclosed the example.]

(;W[eq]C[Here i tried to not do the same I have done before, because I saw that Black was gaining too much influence.]
;B[ep];W[dq];B[cq]C[XCM: classic bad shape. "Hitting the head of three stones."]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[jp]C[XCM: See how similar K4 is to Q10? 4th line, and aimed at keeping white in check.

Had it been me, i would've played something wile like G13, try to live, and nullify black once and for all :P. Obviously, a play like that is highly advanced...]
;W[gp]C[XCM: Nice-youve just hit the head of 3 stones...twice. However, taking into account C3, proceed with caution.]
;B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[fo]C[Here i'll start a fierce battle to survive and try to kill some Black stones. Even though, I wasn't sure about this.

I don't know if it was a good idea to fight right now instead conquer some territory in other corners.

Don't be so hung up on the corners. The centre is huge, y'know, if you know how to play right.]

;W[hl]C[XCM: Passive... H8 at J8 is possible. Cause a big fight to make mayhem. Nullify the centre.]
;B[il];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj];B[gk];W[gj]C[If I have answered incorrectly, could be possible to Black capture these stones?

XCM: It would have to be VERY incorrect. White seems like it's poked a big enough hole into the centre. those 3 black stones would be dead, giving you eyes. all in all, it's ok.

Ok, time to look at teh bic pic: see D11, E11, G11? BIG wall facing the north. good idea to play there before black does, or else he'll beke massive influence AND territory!]

(;B[gl];W[hn];B[in]
(;W[fl]C[XCM: Not neccessary. Better to play on and wreak havoc into the centre. F11 looks good.]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[ij]

;B[jk];W[hk];B[hi]C[XCM: Black has many weaknesses here. F11, J11, K10...

USE THEM! When used properly, i can guarantee you that black will be slapping his head in frustration!]
;W[pp]C[XCM: You are still hung up on the corners, i see...]
;B[op]C[Usually I respond a tsuke (a contact move) with hane (a diagonal move). However this answer is like a instinct.

It's like Bruce Wilcox says in his book EZGO, it's a reflex action. But sometimes is a little bit suspect.

XCM: Nothing wrong with hane, only that it helps black build the centre. I would probably experiment and hane on the outside, with P5.]

;B[dh]LB[jc:B][qm:A]C[Again i ignore some basics of Go. I tried to expand the center group to somewhere. Would be better if I had played in 'a' or 'b'?

I know that in 'b' would be rough to survive, but that way i will be able to split Black groups, right?

XCM: there is a proverb - don't bother splitting two live groups. 

Out of the choices here, I'd go for A.];W[fi]C[XCM: Wrong defect. J11 and K10 are much better pickings. Personally, i prefer J11.

Problem with F11 now is that it's not as defective as teh former two.]

Usually this kind of form is weak, isn't it?

XCM: You mean blacks one? Why complain. 

Yes, empty triangle is traditionally bad.There may be 1 or 2 tactical reasons for this. In this case, black wants to prevent the double atari.]

GarouFH [21k?\]: thanks];W[tt]C[According to Score Statics, Black have won by 9,5. But the Placar shows something different, right?

In general, what you think that i should do? I recognize that my fuseki is a quite mess and I almost never study this kind of stuff (even though I know is really important study fuseki).

Generally, I just rely on the basics moves: tobi, ikken-tobi and keima.

Anyway, thanks for your patience and I hope I was able to do myself clear enough.

XCM: If you wish to be stronger, you really should do some self-research,

Generally, i think you need some work on intermediate level concepts. Read up on influence and entending on "the right sides". 

And try to get into the mind of your opponent. Ask: What does he want? Why did he play there? Where will he play next?

Good luck. I hope i've helped.
