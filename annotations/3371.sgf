C[Hello,

recently I've either played or lost games by only few points and I really wonder how to make the difference. Here I'm playing as black.

Thank you for all your comments!

;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn]
(;B[dr]LB[dr:A][jp:B]C[R: sliding into the corner seems a bit early I'd like K4 for speedy fuseki]

(;W[cq]LB[cq:A][od:B]C[R: seems a bit slow I'd like P16];B[iq]
;W[dk]C[R: after building a rock-solid formation in the lower left corner w should not expand from there it gains only little territory and w will fall behind in development]

(;B[fc]TR[pj]LB[qo:C][fc:A]C[R: since w seems to try for a moyo competition I'd like Q10 to see how w will handle the threat of a b shimary around R5]
;W[hc]
(;B[fe]LB[cf:B][fe:A]C[R: good but you should also consider double kakari C14, plse check your database for variations]
;W[df];B[id]
(;W[eb]LB[ec:B][eb:A]C[I didn't find this in my pro game database so it shouldn't be joseki at least. But what to do about it?

R: since wE17 (see varation ) forms a joseki you should instantly block at F18]

(;B[cc]LB[cc:A][fb:B]C[R: a brave attempt to spoil w's strategie right away but seems too heavy]
;W[dc]
(;B[be]LB[bf:B][be:A]C[R: I'd like B14 (B) more];W[ce];B[bf]
;W[bd];B[ch];W[bi]C[Now it seems to get tough and the three stones at the top are unsettled.

R: well your stones at the side will escape so the position seems playable to me your stones at the top are light and you should regard this as a sabaki situation]
;B[ci];W[bj];B[ei];W[cg];B[bh];W[bg]
(;B[ag]LB[eg:B][ag:A]C[R: here you should abondon some stones and fix your shape with a play at E13]
;W[cf];B[ah]C[R: you must have nerves of steel ;-)];W[fg]C[R: w was allowed to play a perfect splitting attack but since there are no w allies around b escapes easily into the center]
;B[gi];W[hg];B[ii];W[gd]
(;B[he]LB[pj:B][he:A]C[R: b should treat his stones at the top lightly and grab the last big point]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[fd];B[gg];W[ff];B[gh];W[od]
(;B[ld]C[Do you think this is the right choice?

R: feels a bit lukewarm since M16 is too close to the b thickness in the center N16  seems more severe]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[mc];B[pf]C[Maybe I should have played M17 instead?

R: no finishing the joseki and emphasing the right side seems right]
;W[kb]
(;B[qi]C[This and the previous stones seem too small for fuseki moves, maybe R6 instead? Or are there urgent moves somewhere?

R: R6 I'd like more than the move played but O6 confining w to the side and building a large moyo seems urgent to me]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[rq]
(;B[qr]C[R: theres more territory to gain on the outside];W[rr]
;B[cr]C[R: big but to early];W[br]
(;B[pk]C[R: way too small now P7 maps out territory and attacks the w stones]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[jg];B[hf];W[ig];B[hi];W[lg]
(;B[bs]C[R: since w set her stones in motion O15 became most urgent]

(;B[ji]C[R: this is not necessary better fix the defekt at Q13]
;W[mi]
(;B[nj]C[I wonder if there's a way to kill the group... I managed to separate it but it didn't turn out that good for me.

R: these w stones should die a natural death if u fence them in on a larger scale the shoulder hit is to close N8 seems right]
;W[lk]
(;B[il]C[R: wrong direction you must keep the w group seperated from their allies in the lower right corner maybe you were worried about your big group had still no eyes but this group is a lot stronger than the w one so a fight is in your favor]

(;B[ie]C[This was to support some ultimate tesuji that I realized not to work after all, stupid me :).

The rest should be pretty uninteresting yose.

R: well yose is always interesting ;-)
since you lost the game by two points you can call this the loosing move if you had played some sente yose e.g. H4 and D18 instead you should have won at least by two points]
