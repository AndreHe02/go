C[Hi.  I've put all my comments and questions on the moves to which they pertain.  Thank you for taking the time to look over this game.  I always enjoy reading reviewed games and appreciate the time you spend on it.

I chose this game because I think it is an example of my best play.  As I was playing I was trying to work on a few things.  First, not engaging in fights I can't win.  Second, building box-shaped moyo.  Third, looking for moves that will help me indirectly to attack another group.  Any improvements on these or anything else that I could make would be great to hear.

Oh, finally, at move 162 take the variation.  The rest of the moves are just me trying an attack that fails.

Thank you,
David Britt

Hi!

My name is Rainer (8k) and I did the review of your game.

Generally I would like to suggest to choose a game you have lost the next time you request a review. It is very difficult to review a game where you, as you write yourself, played one of your best games. You can learn so much more from games you have lost, where you made mistakes or your opponent forced you to play moves you were not sure of.

Your concept of building box shaped moyos is good, but try to find the big moves first. The generation of moyos should happen all by itself in the process.

Unfortunately White played a very defensive and territory orientated game, missing most of the opportunities there were.

I hope my comments in game file (marked with R:) will help you to enjoy this great game even more :-)

Best regards

Rainer];B[qd]C[BigVat [16k\]: Hallo, gg!

[od][ce][de][cf]C[R: Why not playing a kakari?];W[nq];B[fq]
LB[fp:B][hq:A]C[R: This invites the invasion at A. Better play at B.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[qk];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[md]C[R: Up to this point you follow a joseki...]
;B[ok]LB[nf:A]C[Here I'm trying to make the box-shaped moyo.

R: But you let White the chance to play A, which would limit your possibility for expansion towards the center.]
;W[jc];B[ci];W[de];B[dg]C[I risk the pincer and it turns out to work.  I'm worried things could have been more complicated here.  (Ignore the variation)]

(;W[ck];B[ce]C[Is this weak?  I'm trying to avoid leaving D17 to be a weak group, but I give him influence in the process.

R: Do you know the proverb "Never touch a stone you are attacking"? Because you will almost every time make it stronger.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[qn];W[qp];B[on]CR[oc][nf][ej][fn]C[Box shaped moyo again.

R: That's ok, but there are bigger points on the board (like the marked ones).]
;W[nf]C[I think this was a weak move on his part that helped me quite a bit.  It leaves him with moyo open at one end and allows me to strengthen up with my next move.  If I were him I may have played L15 instead.

R: This move is ok. L15 would have been too slow. White threatens to invade Blacks moyo and gains influence in the process.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[pi];W[og];B[pg];W[fc]CR[fg]C[R: Bad move. F13 would have made good shape.]
;B[ej]CR[gg]C[Here I'm looking to invade his 1-sided moyo, so I try to push in the other direction to get a wall.

R: Why not invade directly at G13 for example?];W[ff]C[But he sees my ploy ^_^]
;B[fh]CR[dd]C[I get box-ish shaped moyo.  I didn't like this move but I didn't find anything I liked better.  Is it okay or is there something else?

R: A move to secure what you have achived is sometimes in order. See the variation what could happen.]

(;W[gg]
(;B[kh]C[Here I'm beginning a reduction.  I don't want him to close that moyo off.

R: Or you could guide him while he closes his moyo and you build one youself during the process (see variation for a possible continuation)]
;W[kf];B[ig];W[gh];B[gi];W[pd];B[qc];W[er];B[fr];W[fs];B[gs]
;W[es];B[hr]C[I was worried he was going to take all of the boundaries with sente.  But he let them go.

R: This are endgame moves but it is still middlegame...];W[pf]
;B[qf];W[of];B[qe];W[ek]C[This was another move of his that I thought was weak.  It gives me the change to close off my space.  I would have played E8.  Between that move and move 30 I think he gave me the game.

R: White is playing too defensive in this game.];B[fk];W[el]

;B[ji];W[mj];B[mk];W[kg]CR[lo][mo]C[I consider saving M13, but I think it would have cost me big.

R: Why not sacrificing both stones and closing the moyo on the lower right?]
;B[jh];W[mo];B[ko]C[Here I decide between defending above and to the left.  I chose to defend the left because I already had that secure box above, but nothing secure at the left.  I'm never sure which way to direct when someone splits my moyo though.  Is there any way that people use to decide?

R: Hm, well, generally I would say play the way you get more points :-)]
;W[lq]C[This move was very generous of him.  He should have invaded.  (In the end the move is worth ~4 points.)]
;B[lm];W[lh]C[This was a little better (In the end this one was worth ~6 points) but again it allows me to secure my moyo.  I was glad to see 88 and 90.]
;B[mn]C[Now my moyo is secure.  I imagine N6 and M7 are worth more than 10 points to me, making the exchange very good.]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[jg];B[hh];W[fg];B[eb]C[Here I begin to take each boundary.]

CR[ob]C[R: Why not P18?];W[ob];B[oa];W[na];B[pa];W[kq];B[jr]
C[So I took 5 boundaries to his 1 (before at F1).  That nets me 8 points.  Without those points I would only have won by 4.5.  (He probably could have taken at least 2 of them earlier when he took the first one.)]
