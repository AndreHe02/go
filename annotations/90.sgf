AB[pp][pj][pd][jd][jj][jp][dp][dd][dj]C[This game was played at home between me (white) and my girlfriend (black). I introduced her to Go and can still give her nine stones and win. However, I am a weak player myself. I reviewed this game but would like a stronger player to go after it and extend, add to and correct my comments. Also I don't play white in a high-handicap game often, so would like pointers where I could have played better.

Thanks, Steven van Dijk

General comment:

Advice to Black:

In general,  in a 9-stone game, Black should avoid complicated fighting and life and death situations.  Black's strategy is simple:  keep your stones connected and strong and keep White's stones separated and weak.  I have pointed out a few situations where you might have played more simply and solidly.

Advice to White:

Congratulations on winning a 9-stone game.  It is certainly not an easy task.  :)  It seems from this game that you have the fighting spirit and the desire to improve that are necessary for becoming a stronger player.

If you want to improve as quickly as possible, I recommend that you spend as much time as possible solving tesuji and life and death problems.  In this game, you made a number of tactical errors that your opponent was unable to punish.  (For example, neither you nor your opponent realized at the end of the game that for several moves Black could have killed a bunch of White stones along the lower right edge of the board.)  Also, some of your analysis is incorrect and fails to consider Black's best responses.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe]LB[rc:a];B[pc]LB[rc:a]C[Comment:

Q17 is of course extremely solid, but Black should think about playing at a instead.]
;W[qi]LB[qj:a][pi:b][oj:c]C[Comment:

There are some moves in go that are virutally automatic.  In response to White R11, the automatic response is Black R10 (marked as "a").  The natural continuation is White b and Black c, and Black has a terrific position.]
;B[qm]TR[qj]C[White expected triangle. This still allows white to push through, although it does protect the corner somewhat.

Comment:

Black suffers a big loss by dropping back to R7.];W[rk];B[qk]
;W[rl];B[ql];W[oh]C[Probably wrong, since white has plenty of eyespace.

Comment:

Agreed.  In 9-stone game, once you make a position, you should play elsewhere as soon as possible.]
;B[nj]C[Black can now strengthen herself.];W[np]C[This was meant to prevent black from turning all that lower right potential into territory.

Comment:

Incorrect thinking.  In general, even in a 9-stone game, you should avoid playing too close to thickness.  It seems here that it will take a couple of moves for Black to make secure territory in the lower right, so an invasion at this point is premature.]
;B[pq]TR[oo]C[I think that triangle would have been better, since black should make white live small here. Also note that black is still open on the right, so the corner may be smaller than it looks.

Comment:

Black Q3 is all right.  It solidly defends the corner, while preventing White from making a base.  Playing at the triangle instead invites White to attach at Q3, leading to complications that Black should avoid in a nine-stone game.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[oo];B[po]LB[rm:a][rj:b]C[Comment:

Sometimes the "automatic" move is the best move.  No matter how natural a move appears, always consider that there may be a better one nearby.  Q5, of course, provides a solid connection.  But what happens in Black defends at a instead?  This locks up the lower right corner, and also threatens to play at b, capturing  White's two stones at S8 and S9.]
;W[ko]LB[kq:a][jq:b][or:c]C[White is making eyespace. Maybe he should have played 'a' now, followed by 'c'.

Comment:

WhiteL5  is okay.  Trying to make a base here is inconsistent with the approach move at O4.]
;B[lq]LB[jo:a][kn:b][km:c]C[Good move.

Comment:

Good move, but the timing is wrong.  When someone plays a shoulder hit, nine times out of ten, the best response is to make a solid extension.  Here, it is imperative that Black play at a, to which White will probably response at b or c.  After that exchange would be the right time for Black to play M3.]
;W[jo]C[White aims at swallowing those two stones.

White 23 is a painful, but necessary move for White.  The reason that 23 is painful is that it would force a stronger Black to respond at J4, which represents a big loss for White.

Comment:

The idea of "swallowing" the two stones is unrealistic except against a very weak player.  My advice to you is to play games against players who are at least as strong as you are, and make your moves assuming best play for both sides.]
;B[hp]LB[ip:a]C[Black doesn't let him.

Comment:

Black H4 is too thin.  Playing at a is stronger.];W[kp];B[kq]
LB[jq:a]C[Instead of L3, Black might think about playing at a instead, to try to keep connected.]
;W[ip]LB[iq:a][jq:b][jr:c][ir:d]C[Comment:

The wheels are starting to fall off Black's position.  It seems here that Black might try to salvage the situation by  fighting the ko starting with the sequence a-d.]
;B[jq];W[iq];B[nr]C[Good move to connect.

Comment:

Agreed, although Black has suffered a big loss.];W[ho]LB[ir:a]
[hq:b][hr:c][cn:d]C[Comment:

Let's take a look at the overall position.  The White groups at the bottom is now very strong.  Is the H4 stone important?  Maybe it was important earlier in the game, but right now the H4 stone is probably not worth trying to save.

The H4 stone is still useful, though.  For example, if Black plays hane at a, White must pull back at b.  I'll leave it to you to figure out why White cannot block at c.

Here, playing at d seems like a calm way for Black to hold onto the handicap advantage.]
;B[hq]C[Don't help worthless stone.

Comment:

Agreed.];W[ir];B[hr];W[cn];B[fp]C[Comment:

This move  helps the stones at H2, H3 and H4, which were short of liberties.]
;W[fn]LB[en:a][bp:b]C[Now black is sealed in and must live by itself.

Comment:

The White cover is extremely thin, and Black should be able to break through, for example, by attaching at a.  However, it's probably better to hold this move in reserve and simply defend at b first.]
;B[mn]TR[cp]CR[mp]LB[bp:a]C[The triangle would allow black to live easily. Now she still is open to invasion at the 3-3 point.   This move threatens to cut off the three white stones. If white doesn't answer, black can play at the circle.

Comment:

The three White stones are relatively small here.  It is much bigger to protect the lower left corner at a.]
;W[mo]LB[cq:a]C[Comment:

Defending the three stones is relatively small.  Invading at a is bigger.]

Black should have pushed at a first.];W[dr];B[er];W[br];B[ds]
;W[cr];B[go];W[hn];B[om]LB[ce:a]C[Black thinks she is safe in the lowerleft. However, she played three times here, securing maybe nine points of territory. That is too inefficient.

Comment:

Black is safe in the lower left corner.  With best play, Black cannot be killed.  However, I agree that Black has much bigger plays available, for example, "a."]
;W[eq];B[fq]LB[fr:a]C[Comment:

It's easier for Black if she responds at a instead of at F3.]
;W[fr]LB[ep:a]C[Comment:

Here, Black must capture the white stone at E3 immediately, and then she should be able to live.  (See variation.)]

(;B[es];W[fs];B[ep];W[cs]TR[hs]CR[gr]LB[eq:a][fo:b]C[White aimed to squeeze black and then connect by playing triangle, thus poking out one eye. However, black can play circle, and white will be short of liberties and fail.

Comment:

It seems that if Black connects at a, the group is in severe danger if White then plays at b.  (See variation.)]

(;B[is]C[Black want to connect to the other group, but this attempt can never work.]
;W[js]TR[ir]C[This white stone can always connect to the triangled stone, thus seperating the two black groups for good.]

;B[eq]TR[gs]C[This was a huge oversight on both parts. Of course black should play triangle now, making a double atari! White will save his six stones and allow black to make two eyes.

Comment:

Agreed.];W[gs];B[en];W[em]LB[dn:a]C[Comment:

By continuing at a, Black has a chance to break out into the center.  (See variation.)]

(;B[dm]LB[dn:a];W[dn];B[el];W[eo];B[fm];W[en];B[gm];W[gn]C[Comment:

Now the Black group has been totally cut off.

Let's try to figure out the current score.

White:  The lower left hand corner is worth more than 40 points, and the right side is worth perhaps another 20 points, so White has locked up around 60 points.

Black:  The lower right hand corner is worth around 25 points.  The middle right is worth perhaps another 10, and the upper right corner is worth perhaps 10 points.  So black currently has around 45 points.

The good news is that Black has terrific influence in the upper left part of the board.  Black still has a chance to make up the territorial distance if she makes the most out of her moyo.]
;B[cl];W[mr]LB[ec:a]C[Comment:

Even if you could kill the black stones, this is the wrong time in the game to play this type of move because it is too small.  Attacking this group should wait until later in the game.  Also, by playing here too soon, you may be giving up some valuable ko threats.

At this point, Black could even ignore this move and play, for example, at a.]
;B[mq]C[Black shows why.]
(;W[ls];B[kr]C[White can never win the capturing race. It does win him some ko-threats, though.

Comment:

As a general rule, if you play a move that appears to be going nowhere, play somewhere else as soon as possible.

By continuing to play stones in this area, you might be cheating yourself of the opportunity to play a more interesting and profitable sequence here later.]

(;W[cf]LB[ce:a]C[Comment:

Black should respond to the approach in a way that best takes advantage of her surrounding moyo.  One simple way to play is to attach at a.  (See variation.)]

(;B[ch]LB[ce:a][be:b][cd:c][df:d]C[Comment:

There is a couple of concepts here.  First, try to avoid playing too close to thickness, either your own or your opponents.  The second concept is that in a fighting situation, try to help your protect your weaker group and the more open area.

C12 may look attractive for Black in this position, but the problem is that it is too close to the stone at D10, and is therefore not efficient.  Also, the upper left hand corner is open, and the single stone at D16 may be weak.

Therefore, here Black should help the D16 stone by a move like a, b, c, or d.]
;W[ef]LB[cc:a][dh:b]C[Comment:

Good move.  Going into the corner at a  is often a correct response to the pincer, but here it helps Black build up too much outside thickness that should work well with the other stones in the Black moyo.  You might also consider playing at b, attaching to a strong stone.]
;B[fd]C[Comment:

Good move.  Puts pressure on the two White stones.];W[hd]C[Comment:

This is an overplay that Black is unable to punish.  Of course, this is a nine-stone game so perhaps this move is justified.]
;B[gc]LB[ge:a]C[Comment:

Black must separate the White stones.  Playing at a is a simple way to proceed.]
;W[hc]LB[ge:a][ff:b]C[Comment:

It is still urgent for Black to move out and separate the White stones.  Playing at a leaves a cutting point now, so Black might think about playing at b instead.]
;B[gb];W[hb];B[ge]LB[ff:a]C[Comment:

Right idea!  But the contact move at a has the advantage of not leaving a cutting point in your shape.]
;W[gd]LB[fe:a][fc:b]C[Comment:

Black must connect at a to keep the White stones separated.  If White then tries to cut at b, Black can kill the cutting stone.  (See varation.)]

(;B[ec]TR[fe]C[The two white stones are looking weak, so black probably should have played triangle, connecting securely and seperating the white groups. She may loose the two circled stones but will be compensated.

Comment:

Connecting at the triangle is a solid way of playing and puts a lot of pressure on White.]
;W[fe];B[he]LB[gf:a]C[Comment:

It would be safer to help the cutting stone by extending at a instead.]
;W[cc];B[ee];W[ff];B[df];W[dg];B[de];W[ce]LB[cg:a]C[Comment:

Here, Black can do a lot of damage to White's position by cutting at a.]
;B[dc]LB[cg:a]C[Good move. It prevents the eye-stealing tesuji (when white plays there) and secures two eyes.

The cut at a is much stronger.  If Black captures the D13 stones, she won't have to worry about eyes.]

Comment:

Disagree.  Capturing here is unnecessary.  If White connects at E18, Black can capture four stones by playing at a.

If Black really wants to play here, she should at least play at b, which captures White's stones at the edge.  If White then plays hane at c, Black can descend with a, and White cannot atari at d because he is short of liberties.]
