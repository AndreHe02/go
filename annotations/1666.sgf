C[g: I added some variations to the game. These variations are an idea, how to coninue the game. If you can find better moves, feel free to use your own moves. 

Gerhard];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[cd];B[dc];W[fc];B[cc];W[dd];B[ed]

(;W[dg]C[g: Instead of this move, white can cut. See variation.]
;B[ec]MA[fc]C[g: This position is good for black. White's marked stone is weak.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[dk];B[bn];W[cm];B[di]
(;W[ej]C[vernon: Was E10 too aggressive, considering my weakness in the upper left?

g: I think white should try to keep his groups connected. Otherwise both groups become weak. With this move, white helps black to split. See variations.]

(;B[ei];W[fi];B[cg];W[df];B[cf];W[de];B[dh];W[ff]C[vernon: I felt that my D16 wall was being surrounded, so I am trying to escape.

g: Right. But I had played F13 to make it more difficult for black to escape. But I'm not sure which move is better.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ek]C[g: This move seems a bit slow. See variation.];B[ck]
C[vernon: B seems to be building territory, so I am building on the outside. Sensible?

g: Since black can build territorry on the lower side easily, a wall on the outside seems a bit slow. White doesn't have any territorry at all.]
;W[cj]C[vernon: a toss in to let me play C8 in sente.

g: This is a mistake. See variation.]
(;B[ci]C[g: This is a mistake of black. See variation.]
(;W[cl]C[g: Here white can reduce black's territorry in sente. See variation]
;B[bj];W[en]C[vernon: I am thinking that this makes thickness toward the center.

g: Yes, but black can make this thickness useless, for example by playing at F4.

g: In this position, the right side of the board looks interesting for both players.]
;B[fp];W[hq]
(;B[gq]C[g: What abaut a variation?];W[hp];B[mq];W[kq]C[vernon: was B's 40th move mistaken for giving me a base on the side?

g: I think the black move was correct. Since black is ahead in territorry, he should keep the game simple.]
;B[qn]C[But he gets the corner solidly (for now).];W[lp]C[vernon: one more stone here to settle it.]
;B[mp];W[qk];B[jd]C[vernon: This seems to be stealing potential territory if I can save my wall.]

(;W[fd]C[g: White might sacrifice the stone on F17 to keep his stones connected. See variation.]
;B[ee];W[fe]C[vernon: Now I have a wall and no possibility of territory.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[fg];W[fh]C[vernon: I connect at either E12 or F13.]
;B[gg];W[eh]C[vernon: I escape again, but now the upper wall is in danger.]
;B[fb];W[gb]
(;B[eb]MA[hc][jb]C[I think he should play H17 or K18 to kill my eye space. I think he can save the corner if he plays 58 at H17, though it looks tough.

g: See variation.];W[hc]
(;B[he]MA[jb]C[vernon: Wrong way. He should attack at K18.

g: Correct way. Black keeps his stones connected. See variation.]
;W[jb]C[vernon: I am worried about that F16 group living, so I am getting some base for eyes.]
;B[nc]C[vernon: He lets me extend that base.];W[lb];B[lc];W[kc]
;B[kd]
(;W[oc]C[g: White can try to escape. See variation.];B[mc];W[pf]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[ri]C[g: I think white can keep his stones connected by crosscutting. See variations.]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[rj];W[ok];B[rg];W[rf]C[vernon: I feel that I have walled off the corner well.]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[pg];W[qf];B[lo];W[ko];B[le];W[ni];B[oi];W[nj]
;B[of]
(;W[lk]C[vernon: I jump into the center for life of the Q9 group.

g: This group is not really in danger. Since the black group around Q4 is not settled, I would have played M6 and R3. See variation.]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[no];W[ml]C[vernon: I wanted to widen the bridge from the P9 group to the L5 group and cutting into the growth space of his Q4 group. But I could have done things like: C3, R3, O18, and B14. What was best?

g: I think R3 should still work.];B[gf];W[hd];B[ie];W[jf]C[vernon: My turn to steal eye space.

g: You can't use this move to reduce eye space of black. If black answers correctly, white gets nothing. See variation.]

(;B[je]C[g: This is a bad move for black. It gives white the chance for an attack. See variation.]

(;W[jh]C[vernon: Again, jump into the center.];B[ig];W[jg];B[if]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[hi]C[g: Good. White blocked black.];B[kf];W[kg]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[gh];W[gi]C[vernon: I now have a center moya by default.]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[ij];W[go]C[vernon: I want to shore up a weak spot in the moya so he cannot get out.

g: correct.];B[fo];W[fn];B[gp]C[vernon: perhaps he should have gone to G6.]
;W[hn]
(;B[bm]C[g: Black should play B8 instead.];W[bl]C[vernon: I could have monkey jumped to A12, but I wanted to separate B5 from D10.

g: Correct, separating is better.];B[bf];W[ib]C[vernon: I feel that this was late. I should have saved this group earlier. But you cannot do everything at once.

g: I think this is not necessary. I can't see any possibility for black to kill white. If you see one, please let me know. A15 were big, and sente.]

;B[jk];W[il];B[jl];W[km]C[vernon: I decide to give up on the J9 group and play at L7 to keep this K10 group from breaking out. It only has one eye.

g: correct.];B[im];W[in];B[ki];W[kh];B[li]C[vernon: This is a complete waste of effort. He gives me more points than if he had gone to N12.]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[mj]C[g: N13 were better.];B[mg];W[nh];B[ng];W[pm]

;W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[pl];W[om];B[ql];W[ol];B[lm];W[kl]C[vernon: First priority is to keep one eye dead.]
;B[ll];W[kk];B[lq];W[kp];B[rk];W[qq]C[vernon: This is the cost of not guarding the corner.

g: If black answers correctly, white can't live. There are too many black stones around.]

(;W[do]LB[aq:a][dr:b][cr:c]C[vernon: I missed A3, which I think would have saved this corner. If W to A3, B to D2, W to C2 will get a second eye either at B3 or D2 (I think).

g: After A3, black connects. I don't find any way for white to live. See variations.]
