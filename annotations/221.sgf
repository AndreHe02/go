C[hello reviewer. i am mark fyffe (buckyyowza 7k* igs).  i played white in this game.

i have no clue what my opponent's strengh is, his account is 7k* igs, but at 184 wins / 6 losses, it is hard to say.  i felt like i played well during the game, but looking over it now, it seems i was struggling.  if you could help me to understand what was happening, i'd appreciate much :)]
;B[jj];W[cc];B[od];W[dp]C[How about taking the bottom right corner instead? That would make it more difficult for Black to use the stone on tengen as part of a moyo.]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ec];B[gd];W[fd]C[Good move, creating a couple of cutting points in Black's shape.]
;B[fe];W[fc];B[ge];W[ee]LB[hc:a][gc:b]C[This looks premature: the two Black stones aren't cutting stones and the White group has plenty of eye space, so capturing them isn't very big. The big move for White in this area is 'a' (H17) - compare this with Black playing 'b' (G17), which leaves Black in a good position to make territory along the top edge.

Alternatively, you could just take the empty corner.];B[ef]
;W[de];B[df];W[ce];B[pp]C[buckyyowza: this seemed good (for white) to me, but considering later in the game, looks very bad now.

PC: The Black stones certainly coordinate nicely, but White has 20 points or more of solid territory in the top left, plus the komi and sente, so I wouldn't start panicking just yet.]
;W[nq]LB[qj:a][pj:b]C[You could play 'a' (R10) or 'b' (Q10) instead. Black is clearly looking to build large-scale moyos or start a fight to make use of the influence that he's built; either of the suggested moves would make this more difficult.]
;B[lq];W[pq];B[qq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[np];W[qn]C[Good move, making it difficult for Black to shut your corner in and build on the right side.]
;B[fq];W[cm];B[qd];W[nd]LB[hc:a][fo:b]C[This looks like the wrong area to be playing in, given that you have 'a' (H17) available to break up the top edge if you need to. With the benefit of hindsight, 'b' (F5)is more urgent: you're already ahead in territory, so starting to erase Black's influence makes sense.]
;B[oc];W[nc]LB[ne:a][nf:b]C[This is asking to be attacked. How about running away into the centre with 'a' or 'b' (O15/O14)?]
;B[kc];W[nf];B[oe];W[ne]LB[ld:a]C[Heavy. I'd consider 'a' instead, which starts to generate some eye shape. If Black wants to push through and cut off the O14 stone, let him.]
;B[nh];W[jd]C[Good. Your stones are heavy, but they're also thick, and this makes some use of that thickness.]
;B[kd];W[kf];B[je];W[ke];B[ie]LB[id:a]C[Should be at 'a' (J16) to capture the cutting stone.]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[jc]C[Cute. At first sight, I didn't believe this worked, but I can't find any flaws.]
;B[hb];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[lc];W[mb];B[la]LB[ob:a]C[Aji-keshi, because the White response to this move prevents Black from playing 'a' (P18) in sente.]
;W[ma];B[ja];W[ld]C[buckyyowza: after this fight, i felt like i was leading but it looks now like i got a tiny group in gote.

PC: Given that I don't think you should have been playing in this area in the first place, and that you started off by making a heavy group, this is not a bad result. Essentially, you've spent a move destroying any chance of Black territory on the top edge, made 12 points or so of territory yourself and have no weak group to worry about. On the down side, you've damaged your top left corner a little, solidified Black's top right (though you have Q18 to reduce it) and allowed Black to get in O12 without having to spend a move on it.]
;B[fo];W[om]LB[im:a][pn:b]C[This is a difficult point. You have about 50 points of solid territory (including the komi), whereas Black has very little territory but lots of influence. Given that you can let Black make 30 points at the bottom and still be in the game, I'd be inclined to play a vague, floating move like 'a' (J7), aiming to establish a group in this area without coming under severe attack. You're idea of coming in from the right with P7 doesn't look unreasonable, but you might be better playing the tighter move at 'b' (Q6), avoiding the problems that Black's next move causes.]
;B[ql];W[of]LB[qm:a][pl:b]C[You could play 'a' (R7) here.Black might answer at 'b' (Q8), but even then he can't cut off your P7 stone without sacrificing the two stones at Q4 and Q5.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[pl];B[qk];W[ok]LB[jm:a]C[This looks a bit heavy. How about treating P7 and Q8 as forcing moves and running away lightly with something like 'a' (K7)?]
;B[pi];W[ki]C[buckyyowza: starting to notice the enourmous moyo on the bottom here. what is the best plan of attack?  should i have pushed it from the left instead to avoid being destroyed on that side?

PC: See previous suggestions.];B[lk];W[ni];B[rq];W[rr];B[mi]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[pj];B[qj];W[mj];B[ph];W[lj]LB[pf:a][pb:b]C[buckyyowza: again, looks like i'm doing nothing while my opponent takes huge territory (the right side). what should i try to do instead?]

(;B[nl];W[nk]C[Good - this helps your eye shape, and it's not necessary to save all your stones.]
;B[pf];W[ob]LB[ml:a]C[Too small at the moment. I'd keep moving into the moyo, e.g. with 'a' N8.]

;B[li];W[kh];B[mh];W[il];B[hj];W[gl];B[dm];W[cn];B[fj]
(;W[dl]LB[el:a]C[You should be concentrating on getting your centre group out of trouble, e.g. with 'a' (E8), rather than strengthening the corner group.]
;B[el];W[em]C[Strengthening the wrong group again.];B[fl];W[fm]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[gn];W[jk];B[ij];W[pk]LB[kn:a]C[Maybe better to start with something like 'a', threatening to make eyes while destroying Black's moyo. If you succeed in making an eye in sente, you can come back and play Q9 for the second eye.]
;B[jm];W[km]C[buckyyowza: this is where i started to feel outranked. how should i have fought this differently?]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[jo];W[gk];B[gj];W[ko];B[jp];W[fk]C[buckyyowza: bad timing, or just bad idea?]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[dk];W[jl]LB[cl:a]C[If you can't answer by connecting at 'a' (C8), you'd be better off not playing the push through and cut in the first place.]

(;B[cl]LB[lm:a]C[It looks like Black has time to kill you by playing 'a' (M7) - see the variation on the previous move.]
;W[lm];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[cf]LB[bm:a]C['a' (B7) looks like it kills your group, but Black's move puts him well ahead in territory anyway.]

;W[ip];B[im];W[ir];B[bo]C[buckyyowza: i felt like there is still some fight in this game, but my opponent told me to resign (specifically i was trying to read a kill for the black group on the lower side).  is there anything that can be done?   pls see variation on move 197 for what i was thinking about.

thanks for your comments, i hope you've enjoyed going over my game.]
;W[ak];B[bj];W[aj];B[bi];W[bg];B[bf];W[nr];B[ns]LB[mr:a]C[Black 'a' (N2) makes two eyes easily.]

(;W[mr];B[rn];W[sq];B[no];W[ms];B[os]LB[ks:a]C[Black lives because the connection at 'a' (L1) doesn't work.]

(;W[no]LB[mr:a]C[Black can live by capturing at 'a' (N2), allowing White to capture the five stones above.]

(;B[mp]
(;W[on];B[op];W[mr];B[ms]LB[ks:a]C[Black could play 'a' (L1) instead and live.]
;W[ks]C[buckyyowza: maybe this?

PC: It needs at least a couple of mistakes by Black. There's also the question of whether this is enough to win, e.g....]
;B[pb];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[gb];B[ab];W[bb];B[hl];W[ac]
;B[ad];W[bc]C[At this point, we have:

Black
  right side: 32 points
  left side: 80 points
  total: 112 points

White:
  top left: 16 points
  top edge: 14 points
  bottom right: 65 points
  komi 5 points
  total: 100 points

So even if the bottom right Black group dies, Black still has enough territory.]
