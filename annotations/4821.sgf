you punished a very nicely];B[ee]LB[dg:A][jp:B]TR[cg]C[usually you only play this move if the marked stone is weak... which it isn't in this case

C[White wins by 6.5 points.
I missed quite a bit of stuff in the endgame i'm sure, please give me some tips of improving my game, I appreciate it.

Well, it is hard to say from one game (and you always welcome to send me more games :))

but from this game I would say: you focus quite alot on center influence, which helped you alot in the opening of this game, but.... you need to take territory in the beginning more than you do =)

and don't play dame points :P

Have a nice weekend!])
