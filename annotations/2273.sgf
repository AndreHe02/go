C[Erik:
Thank you for reviewing this game.
I played black in this game, which was played without komi.
I won this game by 1.5 pt, but would have lost it if white had filled the last pt rather than passing.
With the exception of one major mistake I felt that I played close to the best of my abilities in this game.  I am therfor interested in what can/should be improved.


dieter verhofstadt: my comments will be preceded with dv. The review is made using CGoban. "See var" means "see the variaton starting after the previous move (so it is an alternative for the current move", whereas "See var : " means, see the variation starting after this move (so it is an alternative for the next move)". 

If you remember one thing from this commentary let it be the damezumari at the right side.

I gave more diagrams than explanation. I didn't come round giving a coherent commentary in the given time I feel like doing a poor job this time but I hope it is of value anyway.

Cheers

;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[qb];B[qn]TR[rf][og][qh]C[dv: The influence of the marked black stones rather works towards centre and left than along the right side. Also, the right side is open due to White's marked stone. These things make the lower left corner a much more interesting place than this one.]
;W[np];B[rp];W[pg]C[
dv: White also mistakenly considers the right side to be important. This cut is premature.]
;B[ph];W[oh]
(;B[pf]TR[ph][qh]SQ[og]C[dv: However, this is a technical mistake, a so-called "crude atari", reducing the liberties of the triangled stones, while leaving a possible atari on the squared cutting stone. See var.]
;W[qg];B[rh]LB[ng:A][pj:B]C[dv: This is also rather heavy. The two moves that come to mind are A, giving some shape to the cutting stone and B, making shape for the cut off stones.]

(;W[qi]C[dv Could have been worse. See var.];B[rk];W[ri];B[si]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[ql];B[qm]C[dv: It is very important to learn the weakness at the side: three stones on the second line are a source of damezumari. See var:]

(;W[pl];B[ng]C[Erik:
all in all almost woth it to get this in sente.

dv: Yes. With all the disastrous events at the side, at least you made shape for your cutting stone. Still, the three stones can be captured.]
;W[nl]C[dv: This move and the previous one were quite slow. White invests a lot in capturing worthless stones.]
;B[cn]C[dv: So, now that you are allowed to approach the corner which was most important to start with, the game is almost level.]

(;W[be]LB[cf:a]C[better at A];B[bc];W[de];B[cg]C[dv: This no bad move at all. However, White can easily strengthen his stones. See var:

Black has no big territories anywhere and is not all that strong either. White is ahead now.]

(;W[ef]C[dv: This strengthens Black.];B[eg];W[ff];B[hf]C[dv: Very nice move. Makes White walk on dame while Black is strengthening left and developing right.]

(;B[pb]C[Erik:
this seems small, but I think it's the correct time to play it.

dv: It certainly is not small. It is the epythome of a large territorial move. The time looks right as well because White would not have answered another time in the centre.]
;W[kh];B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[li];B[lf];W[pa]C[very uncertain about answering, but with all stones so i felt that white could do a lot of damage.

dv: Big for sure to answer.];B[oa];W[qa];B[ob];W[gk]LB[fn:F]
[go:E][jp:B][lp:C][jq:A][kq:G][lq:D]C[Erik:
I felt it absolutely necesarry to play in this area, but this stone is maybe to low?
are one of the variations better?

dv: The stones on the right are still vulnerable. An invasion might hurt them. In the left corner san-san is stil open. An invasion may end up in gote. Hence, i wonder Whether a reduction move such as F isn't the best option. If you invade, I like G best.

dv: I disagree. The black group at the bottom is not out of danger and white can damage the left side by threatening it.]
;W[br]LB[oq:A][qq:B]
(;B[oq]C[I messed this invasion up badly.

dv: Not only that: an invasion is not called for, given the weakness of your group. You overestimated its strength, probably because you didn't know the weakness at T10.]
