C[I lost this game with a lot of points so maybe it is worth a review. I am particulary interested in comments on the fuseki. Thanks!

Hi,

I reviewed your game and hope that my comments are of some use for you. Keep in mind though that I am probably not much stronger than you, so please do not take my remarks as definite answers but rather as food for thought.

ug: Yes, I think so. Another question is if R9 is too far from the lower corner.]

ug: Black must be careful to avoid his R9 stone simply being swallowed by white.]

C[Overplay?

ug: Hard to say. On the other hand, if black just plays at S9, white gets a very good result by playing at Q10 himself.]

;W[mj];B[ol];W[ph];B[pl]C[I must be ahead now, but how should I continue?

ug: Black is ahead now. White has a few relatively weak groups on the board, from which black should be able to draw further profit. So black should try to keep white's groups separated, and to make it difficult for white to settle them. On the other hand, there is absolutely no need to desperately try to kill one of the groups - black should just take profit by attacking them. (Of course, if black can read out a clean kill, then he should go for it.)]

ug: R13 instead of S13 also looks very severe (see the variation). But I think S13 should kill white, too.]

C[I
feel that since I am now behind I have to kill his invasion. Correct? What
is the best way to kill?

ug: I don't think black can kill the invasion. (Although I would probably played H17 instead of K17 in white's place.) White's groups are all pretty strong now, so there is not much hope for black.]

Thank you for the comments.

ug: I think you should have resigned earlier, since white was clearly and unshakably ahead as soon as his invasion group lived.

Summarizing, this game was decided by tactical mistakes. So in order to improve, you should try to read more accurately in you games, and study tesuji and life&death problems to train your reading abilities. Good luck!]
