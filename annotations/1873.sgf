C[I'm B in this game. I felt that I played a reasonable opening (probably because W wasn't aggressive enough, which made it easier for me). But from the early middle to the end felt like it just kept going down hill for me. I was not able to effectively use the early lead that I got, and I'm not able to pinpoint the errors that I made (besides a few obvious mistakes). I'm looking for feedback in the following area:

1. Things to improve in the opening phase.
2. Once I build moyo, how to properly defend it.
3. Properly recognizing thickness and make use of it against my opponent.
4. How to stay ahead in yose.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dq]C[This isn't moyo play. If you want to use a moyo style play, you should place the black stone somewhere at the lower right corner to support the stone on your upper right. In your play, a black stone diagonally to each other is more of a territory reducing style of play.]
;W[pp];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[nq];B[ci];W[fc];B[qj]C[So far I have decided not to shimari at lower left because it'll be too slow, and I already played three stones one the left side. If W decides to play C5/D5 at this point, I can always pincer at C7 and chase it out. Is this line of thinking reasonable?

Your thinking is reasonable but pincering at C7 would be a waste of the C11 stone. I would pressure the stone from the top and let white live small (see variation)]

(;W[kq]C[W is playing very slow here];B[jc]C[For both K17 and R10, I'm not sure whether I should play on 3rd or 4th line. What are the factors that I should consider? Is there any reason to play on 3rd for one and 4th for another, i.e., asymmetrically?

A general rule is to play 3rd line when intending to focus on capturing the sides. 4th line play is for gaining influence towards the center. Mostly, people play a mixture of both 3rd and 4th line so they can have a choice to get either the sides or center depending on the development of the game.

A 3rd line, 4th line play is ususlly standard in this case. A black stone at either N16 or Q13 would give black a pretty hefty chunk of territory (unless white jumps in at the 3-3 point)]
;W[pm]C[Another slow move];B[co]C[Just because W is playing slow doesn't mean you have to follow. There is enough B influence at the left for you to safely jump further at C6/7]
;W[fe]C[Another slow move];B[hc]C[This is another place I'm not sure whether it's bigger to further extend on the upper side or should I have extended from the shimari on the bottom, e.g., J3. The reason I played H17 is because I was concerned about a W invasion at N16/17. The lone K17 will be rather weak. Again, I'm not sure I'm trading off correctly. Since W is so timid here, I don't really pay the price by playing a suboptimal move.

This is slow. If you're worried about W jumping in at N16/17, playing at N16/17 yourself would net you a bigger profit than H17. As it stands now, H17 and K17 stones are not alive yet. W can still jump in at N17 to pressure your stones.]
;W[bd];B[he]C[This is still slow. Actually, the biggest move now would be the bottom at around H3/4 or J3/4. But the second biggest move would be at N15/16 which would have the added advantage of connecting the K17 and H17 stones to make them alive.]
;W[gg]C[Seems like W is trying to run to the center here, trying to reduce B center influence. This is not a good move as W is already alive in the corner. W would be much better off if he tried to make a separate live group in the center.]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[hp]C[This move puts pressure on the W stone but that's just about it. In fact, you already have 3 stones pressuring that single white stone. This stone could be better placed at J5. It doesn't put as much pressure on the white stone but it has better influence towards the center of the board as well as containing the lower right]
;W[jo];B[hn]C[Again, slow. There are only 2 stones there and they are not dead yet. You should try placing your move at point like N16, Q13 or even D8]
;W[qf];B[pg]C[The following fight gave me quite a sweat early on. My initial thought was to hem in a W group on the inside to get a thick wall facing the center. But once W reached out, I kind of got flustered and didn't know how to get a thick wall while being sandwiched.

Containing W is a good idea];W[qd];B[qc];W[of]
(;B[pf]C[Don't be in such a hurry to split. Play R15 first to see what W would do.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[oc]C[Would a connection at R17 be better? Before P17 was played, I can't decide whether P15 or S17 is weaker, so I connected at P17. But in another game review, I was told I made too many of this type of connections, and can result in a weak stone at the edge (P15 or S17).

This kind of formation is usually not encouraged as it gives the opponent a chance to peep at O16 or Q18. However, in this case, its alright.]
;W[pi]
(;B[pj]C[Try jumping in at S7 first.];W[qi];B[oi];W[og];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[rg];B[si];W[qg];B[rj]C[The fight didn't end up as I had hoped for (a center facing wall). I don't quite know what the value of the W wall at P is for W (I think W can really use the wall to claim a big piece of the center by playngi at M13, reasonable?). I'm a little uncomfortable about the B group getting cut off from the top edge, but I'm not sure how to make this fight a bit more favorable for B in the end.

White's 3 stones are being surrounded by your stones. If you're worried about W playing at M13, play on that spot yourself to trap W more efficiently as well as gaining yourself more influence towards the center.]
;W[rc];B[rb]C[Good play here];W[sc];B[qb];W[re];B[gi]C[The purpose of this move is to try build a box and try to claim the left third of the board. In addition, I was hoping to chase the running W group into the P W wall while build a B wall along 11. I debated between this and something like K13 to try to contain the influence of the P W stones and cut it off from the top left white group. The reason I chose G11 is because I have very little in the bottom, and I don't want to chase the W group down and make G3 potentially useful to cut the B group apart. I'm still not sure which one is better.

Both plays are equally valid and there is currently no danger of G3 cutting any black groups anytime soon. In fact, I would leave the center alone for the moment and jump in at S7 or S5 area to reduce white's territory. Center fights should be conducted last.]
;W[il];B[hl]C[Too close. G8 would be better. As a general rule, don't place any stones adjacent to opponent's stones if you want to encircle territory. Only do that if you want a fight.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[hi];B[hj]C[This following sequence is another questionable exchange. I played partly because I tried to create more cutting points along W's lines. The reason I want more cutting points is that I'm beginning to worry about the size of the territory that W is staking out on the lower right. If I get more cutting point, it may make future reduction easier. However, if W's more skillful, I may lose a lot here. Is this overplay? Is it better to conect solidly at G10.

You can still jump in at the S5 area. And your group at R10 can still extend outwards. You are not losing territory wise anyway.]
;W[ij];B[ik];W[jk];B[ii];W[jj];B[hh];W[hg]
(;B[qq]C[I played here to experiment with timing of 3-3 invasion. I didn't read carefully at that time, but I think because of O3, 3-3 invasion here is doomed since W can hane at S3.

At this point of the game, I see several choices for B (instead of R3):

1. Protect the left side by playing E11.
2. Bring the R B group out to the center by playing N11, hoping to separate the top W groups from the bottom one.
3. Jump in the middle of the lower R space and attempt to reduce it.
4. Try to develop the top B group more, e.g., M14, with the side effect of trying to separate the two W groups on the top.
5. Slide under at S7 and try to reduce the side.

I'm really not sure what is the best to do here.

Sliding under S7 would be the best move here.];W[qp];B[pq];W[rq]

C[Perhaps tenuki instead?

No. This move is necessary if you don't want your groups to be split]
;W[hq]
(;B[hr]C[Why are you giving yourself more cutting points??]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[jq];B[ir]C[Now that bottom group is almost dead]
;W[jr];B[js];W[gr];B[gs];W[fs]
(;B[fr]C[Very bad move, deserved to be punished :).

Yes. Why don't you try saving the bottom group instead of fighting over a few stones??]
;W[hs];B[er];W[ps];B[mp];W[mo];B[ns];W[or];B[ms];W[lq]C[The bottom group is now dead.]
;B[gp];W[mh];B[mf]C[Is there a better response here if I want to protect the top and make sure W doesn't claim too much territory along the 12-14 area? I thought that if W can connect all it's groups, the game will be very even. This is when I suddenly felt that I've basically lost the lead I had coming out of the opening into early middle game. May be the bad 3-3 invasion did me in, I'm not sure.
N14 It feels very ineffective, and I make moves like this all the time when I'm pushed.

A solid connection at O15 should be better in this case since it cuts off the potential atari]
;W[ne];B[od];W[nf];B[nd];W[me];B[md];W[ld];B[le];W[lf];B[ke]
;W[kf];B[je];W[if];B[jf]C[I have a question about forcing moves like this one. Am I using them right, or am I using them up too often for no good reason?

Forcing moves cause the opponent to place stones at particular locations. Here, these locations actually help strengthen W at the center as well as threatening your group at R10 so you shouldn't force.]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[ig];B[mj]C[My attempt to reduce W here. I know that as long as W doesn't play P10, I can likely make the right B group live. N10 is an attempt to both reduce and trying to protect O10, I don't think it's very effective for either purpose. Any better options in using the B group to reduce W, since that side of W is completely open?

Before you try to reduce W, you should try to make sure you're alive first. Your group there has the potential to be cut at P10, especially since you're surrounded by W. Sliding in at S7/8 would make sure you live.]

C[Perhaps I should have protected the upper edge of this box earlier at E11. One problem I find with moves like this is that it's hard to be defensive and offensive at the same time, which means I'll have to lose sente to do so. If I do it too early in the game, I lose out else where. If I play too late in the game, I get reduce. Is there some underlying principle to find the optimal time to make defensive moves like this?

There is no fixed rule for every situation. The general rule is to play urgent points first before playing for large amounts of territory. But since everyone's definition of urgent is different, it usually depends on your understanding of the game.]

[bs][cs][ds][es][fs][hs]C[Black didn't play badly. However, there are times when black was in danger. White didn't capitalise on those times as he didn't think ahead far enough.

A word of advice to Black though. A good move is one that protects your stones as well as helping you gain territory. Stop focusing on saving one or two stones and look at the bigger picture (ie: the whole board)
