C[this game i think was played badly by white (myself) but i won because my opponent made some mistakes in the endgame.
please comment for better moves.


Hello,
Your game in general was not so bad.  You took advantage of your opponent in many ways, and your opponent missed the standard ways to take advantage of you in the opening, thus leaving black behind for the whole game.  You played a few moves in the middle game (O15 and O10) which are moves which specifically seemed like you were aiming for a big center.  If this is so, remember that if you play like this often, you will have many games like this one where you try and kill a large center invasion.  Such games are very tricky.]

;B[qm];W[cg]C[trying to separate black here, which is the best place to play ?

First of all, generally you play urgent moves before big moves.  Right now, the lower right corner is very weak.  I would probably add a stone there before going on to attack the left.  Luckily, your opponent didn't take advantage of that.  But in regards to splitting black on the left, the spot you chose works fine.]

I think that it is fine if black can cut the side at that point.  Your side group can still connect out the next turn. (see possible variation)]
