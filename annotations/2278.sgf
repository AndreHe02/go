C[Paul,

I reviewed your game and added some comments (preceded by "ug:"). I hope they are of some use for you.

(ug on KGS)];B[dp];W[qd];B[pp];W[ec];B[jp]C[PM: Sanrensei is my favourite :)]

;W[on];B[np];W[pk];B[qo];W[rn];B[qk]C[PM: I'm never sure of the order of this joseki...

ug: So far, it is all right.];W[pj]
(;B[qj]
(;W[pi];B[pl];W[ol];B[qh];W[pm];B[ph]C[PM: I think maybe i should have left this

ug: I agree. C16 is very big now. Furthermore, locally R13 may be better shape.]
;W[ni];B[od]C[PM: I'm never sure where to play at this stage. My thinking here was that I would try and enclose him in the corner against my peices on the edge... I think maybe my edge is too weak. Should I be looking at the whole board a bit more?

ug: Enclosing white in the corner is of course good, if it is possible. But what if W plays P15? (See the variation) I think I would have played in the upper left instead. The potential of white's upper right corner is already diminished by the Q12, R12 stones.]

(;W[oc];B[nc];W[pc];B[nd];W[qf]C[ug: This is ok for black, but I think he should finish off enclosing the corner by playing at P13 or so.]
;B[jc];W[qi];B[ri];W[oh];B[rg];W[rf];B[qg]
(;W[sg];B[sh];W[sf];B[og];W[ng];B[of]C[ug: This result is okay for black, I think.]

(;B[kc]C[PM: I think a double hane may have worked better here...]
;W[gc]
(;B[ef]C[PM: I often end up with these large moyos, but they always seem to weak to make anything of...

ug: See the variation for another idea. If you generally have the impression that having large moyos leads to difficult games for you, than you should play the fuseki in a different way: no san ren sei, but something more territory oriented.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mq]C[PM: Am I attacking or defending? I want to attack, but the contact seems to be the only move because my corner is so weak.

ug: You are attacking :) You should try to split the two white groups. See the variation.]

(;W[lo];B[kq];W[lp];B[lr]C[PM: I thought this was a reasonable outcome, my edge seems reasonably in tact.

ug: Indeed this looks godd for black.];W[no];B[oo];W[mn];B[jn]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]C[PM: I reckon we both have about 50 points of territory:
Black - bottom-right=20, bottom-edge=30
White - bottom-left=10, top-left=20, top-right=15, centre=5

So I just have to use my moyo...

ug: The count for black may be a little optimistic (imagine W playing S4 or maybe even R3), and W will probably get more than 5 points in the center and has komi on top of that, but B should certainly get something on the left side and in the center, so I think this game doesn't look bad at all for black.]
;W[cj]C[PM: Happens everytime! :) Now what? Surely I attack...]
;B[bk];W[ej];B[gj];W[fi]
(;B[gi];W[fh];B[gf];W[gh]C[PM: oh no, its all going wrong now

ug: What's the problem? :) Remember that you don't have to kill this white group. Just by chasing it you will make profit automatically. You should not stake the game on killing this group, so you should make sure that your own position remains thick. White is the one who is under attack here, and you certainly  do not want this to change.]

;B[fe];W[fg];B[gd];W[ee];B[fd];W[ed]C[PM: game over really. I think we both might have made some tactical errors in the fight, but I'm more interested in what direction I should have pushed the fight in.

;W[bj];B[dk]C[ug: I don't think black can achieve anything here right now. If there were a way to make life for the C13 stones, that should be done of course, but unless you can read it out you should leave the situation for the moment.]
