C[Ichijo : Hello I play black here, i feel like my opening are not very good.. you'll see later

Kevin:  Hello, Ichijo.  I'll be doing the review for this game.  I'll include my comments below yours, marked with a K.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[dp];W[qd];B[oc];W[fq]
(;B[cq]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[Ichijo : yep.. this move is it good ? please don't tell me to read a book ^^, because there's no igo book around my place..

K:  You're worried about preventing a corner invastion at a place where you really needn't be.  This early in the game, you should be thinking more in terms of lightly sketching out territory.  Instead of playing 7 at C3, I would suggest someplace more like A or B, which greatly extends your potential influence.  As it is, White can now make a similar extension (probably to around C12) from his own piece, which would have been more dangerous were your stone there.

Even if you don't have a stone at C3, if White invades there, you can simply play straight down from your star-point stone.  (see variation.)]
;W[qo];B[mp];W[iq];B[qf];W[qb];B[pc]C[Ichijo : this move, small isn't it ?

K:  Yes, at least at this point.  Again, during the opening you should be concentrating on more "sweeping" moves, so to speak.  You're getting a nice little set-up in that corner, and I would suggest using its power as leverage.  Try, for example, threatening the white stone at R5 with a move like R7.  It would probably be invaded in the middle, but it would be easier to contain either side.]
;W[qe];B[rf];W[pe];B[qc]C[Ichijo : Small again ?

K:  Not as much so as last time, but still not as compelling as it needs to be.  Right now you haven't taken away enough of White's liberties to make surrounding him a threat.  And as it stands, White can escape by playing S17.]
;W[rc];B[md]C[K:  That's a good move.  You might even have considered playing a kakari (approach move) on White's D17 stone, and then worked back from there to connect with the three in the upper-right.]
;W[re];B[qi];W[pf];B[pg];W[og];B[of]C[Ichijo : here's i want to break a part white's group.. but  i didn't make it

K:  Yep.  The thing about cuts is that they almost always leave the cutting stone with only two liberties.  That means that you either have to immediately threaten your opponent's group with the cut, or you have to be able to make a second stone in either direction a threat (since he gets to decide which way the cutting stone moves out if you don't put him in atari straight away.)

Here, you would probably have been better served by playing Q12 to prevent White's coming around or in.]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[ce];W[gc];B[cc]C[K:  This is okay, but it's not that much more troublesome than if White had invaded you at the bottom left (back around moves 7 & 8).  There are far more profitable extensions to be made on this board.]
;W[cj]C[K:  Like that.

Here's something to keep in mind: Always (okay, almost always) try to work using whatever influence you already have on the board.  That is to say, look at where your existing groups are and how their power affects each other.  (As well as the opponent's groups.)  In this case, when you played C17, you effectively created two very separate groups, one in the upper-left and one in the lower-left.  Now White 34 has split them cleanly and will force each one to make life in its respective corner.  Had you taken something like C10 instead of White, the groups would be more or less connected now.]
;B[cl]C[K:  A good recovery.  Now you've got some much-needed eyespace.  Just remember not to neglect your other groups, only two of which (the upper-right side and the upper-left corner) have anything approaching eyespace.]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[cn];B[el]C[K:  Certainly an answer like you'll find in the books, but I think it might have been better to play D6 this time.  With this move, White can come out, too, and while your groups will continue to be disconnected (creating two more groups that need to struggle for life), White will probably be able to connect to his two stones at the bottom of the board, also increasing his influence and denting yours.]
;W[al]C[K:  Wasn't expecting that.  And although it's certainly hard to stop, it's hardly the most effective move White could have made.]
;B[bk]C[K:  White just left you a huge opening with his misplay--take advantage of it.

I know that right now it seems very important to keep those White stones from connecting, and with the possibility of a push into White's upper-left side group (which is not alive yet by any means) it is not a completely useless stone.  But think of it this way--Black 41 doesn't do anything to advance the cause of either your search for eye shape or your attempt to connect to other groups.  This move would be much better at, say, E6, where White should have played to begin with.  (In addition, even without this play, if you take E6, White would have to scramble to keep the C6 and A8 stones from being cut off and would probably lose at least one of them.)]
;W[bj];B[eg];W[ak]C[Ichijo : I let them connect, but i don't want to let them hmmm.. grow ?

K:  Once again, keeping those stones from connecting wasn't really something you should have been worrying about.  (Had you wanted to, you should have played 43 where White played 44.)  You need to do *something* to connect your three floating stones around E8 to another group, or get them life somehow.  They're not as bad off as they were with Black 43, but they're still in a very precarious position.]
;B[ej]C[K:  Good.  Now we're starting to get things connected here.]
;W[jj];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib];W[hd];B[hf];W[id];B[kc];W[jd];B[kd]
;W[jf];B[lg];W[jh];B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[dd];B[fb];W[fc];B[ed]
;W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[cd];W[cf];B[bc];W[bg];B[bm];W[bl];B[cm]
C[K:  You should take advantage of White's position to strengthen yours.  Notice that if you play A7 instead of C7, White will be forced to protect his three stones, which he will probably do by capturing the B9 stone.  Then you can play C7 anyway, and not worry about White causing all sorts of problems with an invasion at A7.]
;W[am];B[an];W[ck];B[bn]C[K:  Similar effect.  This also works, though you could debate which path gets you the most points and influence.]
;W[ql];B[pi];W[nf];B[oe];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[ni]C[Ichijo : arrgh.. this is when my hand getting sweat, can you tell me were i did wrong ?

K:  The long and short of it is that you let your groups get disconnected, a development which can be traced through the entire game.  Here, Black 87 is far too non-threatening to White, not to mention doing little or nothing to aid you.  You would have done well to play where White played 88--it is the point which would have allowed you a chance to connect the stones at M13 and N13 with the small group on the right side.  Now, I'd probably chalk off the three stones as dead, barring some series of horrendous mistakes by White.]
;B[kg];W[kf];B[se];W[sd];B[sf]C[Ichijo : whoops.. this must be because I was nerveous

K:  I think you're just incorrectly valuing the moves.  Black T15 is an extremely small move given the number of much more pressing concerns to be had on this board.

More to the point, however, White can now slaughter your group with a cut at S12.  (Though we've all been in this situation before... )]
;W[rh];B[li]C[Ichijo : I'm trying to escape here, but somehow i feel like white next move can give me some way to the exit, i just don't feel confident to make a move.

K:  Although it's possible that this group can snake its way out of White's immediate grasp, building a living group in the center is hard enough as it is, and what you're doing is basically trying to make life in the thick of enemy territory.  White's next move should be something like an attachment at M10, from whence he can control that group fairly handily.]
;W[lj]C[K:  And there it is :X  I would strongly suggest leaving a group in a situation like this for dead, and just hoping to use them for their aji (leverage) later in the game.]
;B[pd];W[ml]C[Ichijo : I think I'm in trouble here.. I just don't like the word resign ^^

K:  It would probably be your most elegant option.  But I know sometimes you can't help but play on :)  (Anyway, there are still plenty of lessons to be learned from a losing game, probably more than from one you win.)]
;B[oh]C[Ichijo : sente..

K:  In name only.  White can escape at any time by capturing at T13, so what would otherwise be a deadly trap turns into little more than an extravagant ko threat--which you've just expended to no practical effect.]
;W[sg];B[oi];W[nh]C[Ichijo : White is so want to kill me, but this move bad isn't it ?

K:  It looks like a good move at first, from the perspective that those stones on the top aren't dead (not as dead, anyway) if you can connect them to your other group.  He's keeping you split apart.

However, you found the correct response and managed to connect all the stones.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[mi]C[K:  Well done.];W[nk];B[oj];W[ok];B[jg]
;W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[gf]C[Ichijo : this is when I was getting over confident, because i tought i can win this race.

K:  What race?  As it is, this is probably a good move, since otherwise those two stones would probably have been swallowed up and destroyed.]
;W[je];B[gb];W[hb];B[ea];W[qj];B[ri];W[rj];B[ih];W[hh];B[ii]
;W[ji]C[Ichijo : This white moves.. wrong isn't it ?

K:  Not necessarily.  If White were to play H11 instead and let you kill his K12 stone, the three (then four) stones to your left would probably still stand little chance of surviving.  So he chose to connect to a group he could definitely save rather than extend one he probably couldn't.]
;B[hi];W[gh]C[K:  Maybe I overestimate White's foresight... clearly, you perceive how to contain him.]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[eh];W[fi];B[fj];W[ei];B[di];W[dj];B[gg]C[Ichijo : This move is useless.. am i right ? is it better if I play at c12 ?

K:  This move or D12 are probably your best bets.  C12 would neither threaten White nor expand your territory or influence, and in fact would leave you open to more troulbe than putting the white group in atari now.]
;W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[dk];W[gj];B[ij];W[ik];B[fg];W[hj];B[jk]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[kl];B[jm];W[hn];B[hl];W[lq];B[ki]C[K:  This move doesn't especially help you, and meanwhile White is knocking at your door on the bottom right.  Remember that those two stones still have almost no eye shape, and it behooves you to get some--or at least connect it to the three stones hanging down from the center--before White takes it all away.]

;W[jq];B[kp];W[ip];B[ls]C[K:  You should save these sorts of moves either for the endgame or as ko threats.  To use them simply because they're there is wasteful.]

C[Ichijo : what if I play at F5 ?? better ?

K:  Maybe.  But there's no really good solution to this situation.  Since White will probably descend to C5 now, I would almost just tell you to consign the handful of stones at the very bottom left to the realm of the dead, and try to make sure the rest of your pieces are alive.]
;W[do];B[co];W[eo];B[cp]C[K:  Interesting choice by White.  Not sure how this will work out.]

Game is completed.

Ichijo : OKay game is completed, thanks for reviewing my game

K:  Sure thing.  Some thoughts in summary:

You won this game because you managed to kill White's group at the top-center, but it was looking perilous for a while there.

You shouldn't worry so much about the little things in the very early game; think more about sketching out possible territory.  Invading, for the most part, is the domain of the middle and end games.

Finally, think more globally:  it's easy to get caught up in one local conflict, but when you're fighting one (or when you might fight one), think about its effect on the rest of the board.  In addition, try to keep your groups connected.  Here they ended up that way, but where it not for White's disasterous escape attempt in the left-center, there were one or two of your groups which might have been doomed.

Hope that helped, it was fun to review your game.  Best of luck playing Go!]

(;B[cj];W[cq]C[K:  If White invades here...];B[dq]C[K:  ...threaten him nicely this way.]
;W[cp];B[co]C[K:  From here, White may take the corner, but it shouldn't be hard to keep him cut off from his F3 stone, which becomes very weak.  In addition, you'll gain a lot of outward influence through this sequence.]
