C[Hello!

My name on KGS is Talaer. I am around 10 kyu. I'll do my best to give pointers and answer your questions. My answers are far from definitive, however. I'll try to precede any of my comments with the letter T.

Thanks,
Tim

----------------------------------------

CaeZaR: Short game here. I'm interested in general comments and answers to specific questions.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[fp];B[dl]C[T: See variation here.]

(;W[pj];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]LB[bq:A]C[C: Isn't this better at 'A'?

T: I think A would be the normal move here.];W[co]
(;B[dq]LB[eq:B][er:A]C[C: I think this should be at 'A', as my reply at 'B' is painful.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[ds]
(;W[jq]LB[kq:A]TR[dp][fp][eq][fr]C[C: I'm trying to build off my triangled strength.  I'm thinking one more space ('A') might have been right.

T: This move does feel a little close, but one more seemingly urgent thing is staring at me right now. The position on the lower left seems potentially killable via placement. Let's see.]
;B[oq]C[T: Black wants to be attacked very badly it seems. He's now got two weak groups and one killable group on the board.]
;W[mq];B[oo];W[qn];B[pm]LB[om:D][qm:B][on:C][pn:A]C[C: I guess I have a choice between 'A' and 'B', right?  Which to choose and why? I picked 'A' with the aim at cutting at 'D' if he replied at C.

T: This move is easily an overplay by black. The knight move is for attacking, and he is far from being in the position to attack. However, I would have preferred the move at A instead of R6 to begin with. If I were to choose here, I would cut immediately and fight. Playing B here seems to submit to his will.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[om]C[T: Good.];B[nm];W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[mn]
TR[nl][nm][on][oo][oq]C[C: At this point, I'm feeling good about the right hand side. His wall (triangled) is somewhat offset by my two bottom stones.

T: This 'wall' is thick but barely effects anything since it faces your already strong group.  It has no base and maybe one eye for now. This group should be a burden on him for the rest of the game. Your result here is splendid.]
;W[qf]C[C: I felt this was a good kikari with the right hand side.

T: Certainly one of the larger opening moves, but typically in the opening weak groups are worth more. Being that you are approaching a hoshi (4-4 point) stone, black can pretty easily ignore your move to strengthen himself.]

(;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc]
(;W[fc]C[C: Invading to avoid Black getting the whole top of the board.

T: You are already very far ahead in territory. It would take black multiple moves to secure the entire top, or the upper left corner. Instead, you should attack.]
;B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[ic]C[T: See how your exchange has aided the stones on the left side. While they can still be attacked, a play there now will be cramped and have a much harder time being effective.]
;B[kc]C[C: I thought this was a good point for Black to pick up.]

(;W[ie]C[C: Wasn't sure about this move. Thought that extending into the center was a good idea as this group is kind of tight.]
;B[di]C[T: Black how now received enough sente moves to secure the left side (to a degree) and fix his weaknesses there. It is still open on the lower end, so his points there should be limited. However, this exchange was still to his benefit.]
;W[mj]C[C: Again, not sure... But I thought it expanded the right side and kept Blacks lower group in danger.

T: Good idea.];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[jp];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[in]
;B[im]LB[jm:A]C[C: I think Black is being too agressive.  I think I should have cut at 'A'; do you agree?

T: I'm not sure. Black has a strong thick shape with his group, so he might have the right to be aggressive here. This move might help exploit aji around L3.]
;W[hm];B[il];W[hl]
(;B[hk];W[jm]C[C: Now I cut anyway.  With so many cutting points in Blacks line, I think I have to be able to take advantage of the situation somehow.]
;B[jl];W[km]
(;B[kn]C[C: Empty triangle.  Not good.];W[ln];B[ko];W[ll]TR[jm]
[km][ln]C[C: I want to make sure the triangled stoned connect to safety.]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[lk];W[mk]LB[kk:B][ml:A]C[C: 'A' or 'B' and I think I'm free to connect with the right side.]
;B[ml];W[kk]
(;B[ik];W[lj];B[lo]C[C: It looks as though all the Black stones in the bottom right are dead.  Black must have thought as much because he resigned at this point.

T: It probably can not live at this point. The bottom left is still killable and black can be greatly reduced on the left side.

I hope this review was helpful at all, this game is pretty short and you won too. If you have any questions you can email them to me at helxis@comcast.net

Also, if you ever want lessons online, add me to your buddy list on KGS. My username is Talaer and I give free games or reviews all the time.

Thanks!])

(;W[cj]C[T: Black stones feel lonely now.])
(;W[mk]C[T: Maybe a move in this area. Try to attack the black stones and develop some influence. This black group is thick though, so I would not try to kill it unless I definitely knew I could.]

(;W[co];B[dn]C[Forcing this sort of exchange first is a good idea because black played D8 far too close. Now he is very overconcentrated and your corner is more protected.]
