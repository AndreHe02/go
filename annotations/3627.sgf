C[Dear Reviewer,
I chose this game because i felt that it was very close from the beginning until the end, were i made quite a big mistake being short on time. This game is dominated by fighting were i probably made some shape mistakes which lead to inefficency, but see for yourself ;) i played white in this encounter ;)
thanks in advance];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]

(;W[pe]LB[cc:A][hc:C][qe:D][ci:B]C[Dakre: i thought A and B would be good miai so i chose to tenuki and prevent the shimari in the upper right...

SGF: An alternative way to prevent it is to nullify it before it is made.  See the variation at C.

Also, as shown by the response to this move, it would probably have been better to play a low approach.  See variation at D.]
;B[md]C[Dakre: i didn't really know how to respond to this move... never saw it before... i remember o16 and white responds with the attachment at r17, so i thought when i continue with that sequence it would be better for black... so i chose to tenuki again ;)

SGF.  Best to settle this stone.  If B attacks it then the chances of ever invading the top will disappear.]

(;W[qn]C[SGF:  Not good.  Just asks for a double pincer.];B[pg]
C[SGF. Way too close.  W can temporarily abanson this stone and settle himself on the right.  There is plenty of aji left in it for the future.]
;W[np]LB[qj:A]C[SGF:  WRong direction.  W is scattering stones with an invitation for B to attack them all.  Settle the right side and wait to use the aji at the top right.  I would play A]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp]LB[qj:A]C[Dakre: i thought this was a mistake by my opponent, but i was not really able to exploit that... but maybe r4 is alright... i chose to cut

SGF.  If this cut worked then this would not be joseki.  Play A.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[op];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql]C[Dakre: serious fighting develops... ;)]
;W[om]C[SGF:  W has got himself into trouble.  This move does not really help much as it just forces B to attack the stones at the bottom.  Leave this sort of move in reserve until needed.]
;B[nn]LB[mo:A]C[Very heavy. 'A' is better shape];W[nm];B[mn]
;W[rl];B[qk];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[pr];W[lp];B[qr]
(;W[kn]CR[dq]LB[rk:A][jp:B]TR[nm][om][pm]C[Dakre: is this the right direction? i wanted to build influence to the left and thought that the marked white group would be able to escape due to the weakness of the black r8 group, what do you think?

SGF.  R8 is not weak because A is sente.  This move is way too aggressive.  W should stabilize his own stones in sente (if B ignores then the B stones about come nder attack.) and forget about the three marked stones for the time being.  

Starting at A would be a good start because the sequence shown in the variation kills the corner.  B would not be able to play that way and so W would have the advantage.

As it is, all this move does is leave a weakness behind for B to exploit.  The idea of building thickness to the left is dubious given the position of the circled stone.]
;B[mm];W[ok]C[SGF: No way for this to work.  This is just offering up a sacrifice.]
;B[rk];W[sn];B[ml];W[nk];B[pj]LB[pi:A]C['A' is better shape.]
;W[mk]LB[pe:A][rk:B]C[SGF: W cannot expect to get away with this.  As W tries to save these stone there is going to be two major impacts on the rest of the board:

'A' is going to die a natural death without B even having to try.

The lower side is going to be severly weakened as B runs to the left.

Now that B has 'B' in place the killing sequence in the lower right does not even work any more.

Given that W has committed himself to saving these stone he probably has little choice but to continue.  But his prospects of winning are bleak.]
;B[kl];W[kj]LB[lk:A]C[Dakre: i was not very consequent with that idea now driving black to the left ;)

SGF:  This is a weak shape. B can push throuigh and cut very easily.  'A' is the only move.]
;B[il];W[ip]C[Dakre: looks somewhat like a shape error... but i didn't see a better move here

SGF:  It is necessary to defend the lower side, but as you say, there is not a really nice shape move.  Also, having to play here loses the initiative in the center.  W is in trouble.]
;B[mq]C[SGF:  Irrelevant.];W[mp];B[nr]C[SGF:  Why would B take gote on these small moves when there is a fight raging in the center.  Suddenly W is back in it .]
;W[ij];B[in]
(;W[gp]C[SGF:  W needs to defend first.  One possible variation is shown.]
;B[ko];W[jo]
(;B[lo];W[kp];B[jn]C[SGF: B is now safe. The pendulum has once again swung in his direction.   Neither player is reading very well at this stage.]
;W[nh]C[Dakre: protecting the cut and threatening to pull out q15...]
;B[of];W[qc]LB[nc:A]C[Dakre: ... with the idea of trying to live in the corner... but i was not able to read all the variations here... maybe black could have played sharper...

SGF:  Playing 'A' first would have been sharper.];B[qd];W[pb]
C[SGF:  Have to cross-cut.];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb]LB[pd:A][rd:B]
TR[nc]C[Dakre: i had two moves in mind... A and B, but i think A would not work...

SGF:  Which all goes to show how useful a stone at the marked point would have been.]

(;W[rd]
(;B[pd];W[qe];B[ob]C[SGF:  W is dead.];W[rg];B[qh];W[oe];B[nd]
LB[nf:A]TR[of][pg][qh][pj][qk][rk][ql][qm]C[Dakre: black played very calm i think... now i felt happy being able to attack the marked black group...

SGF:  It is hard to see how that can be attacked effectively when W has to worry about living.]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[mf];W[le];B[lh];W[li]LB[mi:A]C[Dakre: shape question again... maybe A is better?

SGF: Absolutely.];B[kh]C[SGF:  Now B is threatening the W group below.  This would not have happened had W not let B live so easily below.]
;W[ih];B[mi]C[SGF:  This is wrong.  There is no wayh to directly attack this group.  But W is also weak at the top so B should be looking for a splitting attack.]
;W[mh];B[ki];W[lj];B[ni]C[Dakre: i thought of giving up those two stones protecting the cut at k10 and connecting my two weak groups around k14.

SGF:  Is that a connection?];W[oi];B[oh];W[nj];B[jj];W[ji];B[jk]
;W[lg];B[mg];W[mj];B[jg]C[SGF:  Very optimistic.];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[og];B[pf]C[Dakre: i don't know who would have won the semeai if i connected at m14 and black played o13... but i thought even if i play m14 and black just plays s14 and the white group lives, black takes sente to attack the marked white group which would be eyeless (when black has s14)... see variations for explanation ;)]

(;W[ng];B[lf];W[ld];B[mb];W[je];B[ig];W[cc]C[SGF: There is no time for this.  The W group on the right is not safe.  But more importantly, if it becomes safe then W can harass the B group below.]
;B[he]C[SGF: Perfect.];W[rh];B[sc];W[se];B[ri];W[rf];B[co]C[SGF:  I think I would play high here. It puts more pressure on the 3 white stones in the center.  Because W is open below B is not too worried about the size of the corner.]
;W[cm]LB[dl:A]C[SGF:  I prefer A.  Better balances with the top left and also leans out towards the three center stones.]

(;B[cq];W[cr];B[br]LB[dp:A]C[SGF: Better to play A and challenge W to a ko which he probably cannot win.]
;W[cp];B[bq];W[dp];B[dr]C[Dakre: i thought this was a bad move by black, but who knows... ;)

SGF:  B really does not have a good option.];W[er];B[cs];W[bp]
C[Dakre: i at least felt happy with this result...

SGF:  Yes, a success for W.];B[jc];W[kc];B[jd];W[jb];B[ib];W[qf]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[ja];W[kf];B[kg];W[dj]C[SGF:  W has a very comfortable game now.  B has played some really small moves]
;B[gj]C[SGF: Too small.  B has to threaten in invade the side in order to get more in the center.]
;W[gh]C[SGF:  W does not really need to safe these stone.  B is trying to capture on a small scale and so by forcing him to do so W can gain quite a bit to the left.]
;B[dg]C[Dakre: now i became very short of time];W[cg];B[fh]
C[SGF: Funny move.why not extend?];W[fi];B[gi];W[fg]C[SGF:  Very dangerous.  Even if W succeeds in saving the center stone there is no guarantee of overall success.]
;B[eh];W[hg];B[hf]C[Dakre: i was happy again that black made l15 sente for me

SGF:  This is dame.  W cannot cut.];W[ef];B[ej];W[di];B[ei]

(;W[fo]LB[gn:A]C[Dakre: mistake number two ;) maybe A would have worked... but i guess black is ahead by about 10 points anyway when i let him in with playing at A... so the game was lost before...

SGF: On the contrary, W is well ahead after the variation shown]
;B[go]C[Dakre: my game became messy at the end because i was short on time and my opponent was able to deal with that being faster ;)
i'd be interested in your oppinion especially considering the opening and the excessive fighting where shape seems to be important
