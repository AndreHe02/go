AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[RS: Hi Oren. I am 8 kyu on DGS (Dragon Go Server, www.dragongoserver.net) which is a very good site to play time-based go games. I highly recommend it. If you want, we can play a teaching game. BTW, if anyone stronger then I says something differenct, you should probably believe them.

One thing I never try to do unless forced is directly fight with someone 9 stones stronger then I am. I never play right next to their stones unless I am *absolutely* sure I will be safe. Do not fight as you did here, but threaten. To threaten, you play close to them but NOT right next to them. W will always win in a fight, but if you threaten, if W tries to fight, your response will strengthen you stones.

If W plays within 2 lines of a stone of yours, this should make you nervous, since he's looking to attack.]
;W[nd]C[toto12 [28k?\]: hii];B[qf];W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[RS: For instance here. You are initiating a fight with someone 9 stones stronger then you. There is a reason they are 9 stones stronger. You will loose 95% of the time. See variations.]
;W[od];B[qc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[rc];W[nb]C[toto12 [28k?\]: good]
;B[oe];W[rb];B[qe];W[hd]C[RS: W's looking to attack k16, but your next move, f17 was good, just not the follow-up.]
;B[fc];W[hb]C[RS: As you play handicap games, you will see this stategy more and more. W will threaten 2 coners on the same side of the board like here, and then capture your k16 stone. Here is a good chance to cause W trouble. BTW, Bf17 was a good move since it strengthened Bd16 AND threatened Wh16 (1 move with 2 purposes).  See variation.]

(;B[hc]C[RS: Instead of Bh17, try 'a'. Again you're playing right next to W, and he wins.]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[id];B[jc];W[if];B[je];W[hg]C[RS: Here was another chance to save your k16 group. See variation on the next move.]

(;B[eg]C[RS: This is way too high. W can still invade at c14 for instance.]

;W[kg];B[lf];W[kf]

C[RS: See, I said  W would probably try something like this back at move 26.]
;B[ce]C[toto12 [28k?\]: tnx

RS: This was exactly correct. Playing the hane at c15 to seal W into the coner.]

(;B[ba]C[hitsuji [12k\]: no.
hitsuji [12k\]: 27k does not know moves like b19
toto12 [28k?\]: tnx

RS: W is correct that 27k's normally do not know this move. Though this would normally kill W's corner, W had g19 to play. However, see variation to kill the corner.]
;W[ga];B[gb];W[fa];B[ib];W[ha];B[jb];W[ac]C[RS: I believe this is a mistake by W. See next move's variation.]

(;B[da];W[eb];B[ec]C[toto12 [28k?\]: good move];W[lb]C[RS: I'm not sure why W made this move. His stones seem safe, your stones seem dead to me.]
;B[md]C[RS: It seemed to me you also thought your stones were dead. If so, don't throw good stones after bad. Since you have sente, play elsewhere, c4 for instance.]
;W[ke];B[jg];W[jf];B[jh];W[ld];B[gh];W[ca]
(;B[ge]C[RS: This move is not necessary. Yes, it forces W to play h14, but W can do that anytime. Higher ranking players would say you should save this as a ko threat in a possible ko fight. Therefore, now would be a good time to strengthen your lower left corner, since it's still open and W has given you sente (advantage of the move). See variation.]
;W[hf];B[gf]C[toto12 [28k?\]: bambo

RS: Better would have been d4.];W[cn]C[RS: Ahhhh, now W invades.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[gq];W[ck]C[RS: W is securing himself a base with c9 and pressing either/both up into the center or up towards the top, therefore you should play c10 because you cannot stop him from pressing into the center but you can stop him from pressing into your territory.]

;W[me];B[he];W[ie];B[ee]C[RS: Good move! This would have been necessary some time, and you timing was right to wait until the endgame to make it.]
;W[lr];B[tt]C[RS: My main suggestion is in a 9-stone handicap game playing B, do NOT attack W by playing right next to him, but theaten by playing 1 or 2 lines away in the begining. If you want to play right next to W, then only do so by extending from a strong group as in the middle game. 

Also, if W plays within 2 lines of you, BE CAREFUL, he's looking to attack.]
