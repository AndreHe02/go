Hello,

You won this game because you played against the computer and it made many mistakes (30k mistakes in my opinion).

The problem is that you entered Black's sphere of influence too early and you gave Black control of the game.

When you see your opponent develop, you must not rush in and invade, it is better to develop your own moyo.

Later on, when it is appropriate, you can invade or reduce your opponent's moyo.]

(;W[qf]LB[jp:B][mp:A]C[Was this a good place to approach or was Q5 better?

There is a general strategy in go that says: "Attack while gaining profit".

This move allows Black to attack White while gaining profit (territory on both sides). Therefore, it is safe to say that a play at White R14 or Q5 is bad (even vulgar since it helps Black and hurts White).

It is better to develop the rest of the board and then invade or reduce when it is appropriate. For example, moves like A or B are nice, big opening moves.]

(;W[mq]C[Is attaching at this point a good idea?

--

The solution to this problem is really to play N3 before Black plays M3. 

Now that Black has played M3, the situation is bad for White.]
;B[mp];W[lp]C[I chose to cross-cut instead of extend because I think black's M3 stone would be weaker and he would have to capture W38.

--

Battles like this usually end up solidifying the stones involved. Black has territory to gain from this battle so he will play to secure the territory.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[kq];W[ko];B[jp];W[ip];B[nq]C[I have doubts about this move; wouldn't J3 have made more use of the G4 stone?

--

G4 is still a big thorn in White's foot and Black secures territory in the bottom.]

(;W[mo]LB[hr:A]C[Should have been at G5, attacking the black stone.

White is open on the bottom and Black can live quite easily down there.

Will White's resulting thickness allow him to get compensation for the lost territory?]

--

This has nothing to do with heavy or light or sabaki.

This is a plain old invasion. It's a very complicated invasion with repercussions all the way up to the the top corner (try reading out long variations to see how the top corner is affected).

You are trying to take a chunk of the center. But it is open from too many different directions.

I think you would be better to play something that has more concrete results.]

There is nothing to cut. Later on, you make reference to possible territory here, but there are too many ways in.

It seems like a big hole on the board, but once you put in the borders there is very little of that hole left to be territory.]
