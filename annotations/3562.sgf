C[Ryzours  : Hello.
I played white in this game which was played on the dragon go server in august 2005. We agreed before the game that we could use any books, websites or sgf editors to try to make the best moves we could. The game was quite even at the beginning, and I had troubles to figure out which moves where the more urgent. I ended up losing because I didn't defend a weak group, and I'd like advise about the timing of the moves and their shapes.
Thank you for your time.


Dakre: hi... it was interesting to review a game where the players put so much effort in it. Games played on the dragon go server with almost no time limit seem very appropriate for the GTL.
You fell somewhat behind in the Fuseki but i think there are more important points in the game where you should concentrate on - to evaluate the strength or weakness of a group... to think during the middlegame of which groups of your own can become a target of attack or which you could try to attack yourself... cutting and connecting... these are the important points of this game, i think]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[dj]C[Ryzours : My opponent used the low chinese formation, so I'll probably have to play around L3 or to invade at Q5 sooner or later. As I couldn't figure which was best ( I don't like either. I don't like playing against the low chinese.), I played the san ren sei to see what happen next.

Dakre: I think I often see a move around L16... when playing white it may be a bit slow to play D10, but generally it seems ok... i am not a that good fuseki expert to judge on this ;)]
;B[fc];W[hc]LB[jd:A][kd:B]C[Dakre: this princer is too close! as you see in the variation black can press white down and build a lot of influence facing the bottom which perfectly works together with the low chinese.... but playing a princer seems to be the right idea... maybe A or B...]
;B[fe];W[df];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[hd];B[he];W[jc];B[kd];W[lc]
;B[fq]LB[kb:B][nc:A]C[Ryzours : I'm not good at josekis, this one is one of the only ones I know, but I don't  really understand it. I don't like the possible cut at L17, and black can still invade at C17. But as black chose not to defend at G16 and there's a possible cut at J15, I guess this is allright.

Dakre: the cut at l17 is not a problem yet... it may become one when black has a stone nearby at A for example... then black may be able to undermine the white base with B.
If you plan to cut you should not play G16... it makes an empty triangle and G15 is more effective... but the problem with that is as you already found out yourself, that black can life in the corner afterwards... that is why black does not have to defend that cut yet... (see variaton)
Black may consider playing N15 which completes the shape and gives nice influence]

(;W[cn]LB[dh:B][cl:A]C[Dakre: I think this move is a bit overconcentrated. black has spread all his stones on two and a half side now and white has little territory at the top and a big left side which still is open for invasion at A and B... white can not defend both with one more move... so C6 may be better at the lower side princering the f3 stone and reducing the black moyo at once... k4 looks good to me for example]
;B[jp]C[Ryzours : My opponent is starting to use the low chinese formation to create a moyo, so I guess it's time to start an invasion.

Dakre: K4 is a perfect move for black now... white almost has to prevent the shimari in the lower right, but the princer at R9 is already wating]
;W[po];B[np]
(;W[pl]C[Dakre: this is a bad move. a shoulder hit is almost like touching stones and it makes both sides strong... this is good when you are weak and the other side is already strong, because you will benefit more from "both getting strong" BUT in this case the black stone at r9 is weak. it may be a good target for attack later... so one idea may be to lean on the lower side to become strong and then attack the r9 stone (see variation)]
;B[pk]C[Dakre: very good move from black and it is so natural that he could not miss it... ;) these two stones exert their strength to the upper side which should catch your interest now. that is why Q8 is not so good...]

(;W[qp]C[Dakre: R4 is giving away too much... R3 is still possible... don't be afraid of the cut...]
;B[qq];W[nn];B[lp]TR[pk][qk]C[Ryzours : I ended up with a strange looking group. Its shape seemed ok to me so I played elsewhere.

Dakre: this group has no base... it is undermined by r9 and it's weak. black has perfect shape at the bottom and the marked group is threatening the white while preparing the upper right to become territory...
i think black has come out ahead in this opening];W[qf];B[qh]
;W[of];B[nc];W[fp]LB[md:C][oh:D][hq:A][er:B]C[Dakre: this move again stregthens both sides... so it takes the chance to invade around A... but it secures the corner as well... but i think black is getting more from this exchange... when you want to secure the corner, which isn't small, i'd prefer B and hope for it being sente...
but there are other big points on the board like C or D... both protect the marked group from an attack...]

;B[pi]LB[ec:H][kc:I][gd:G][md:J][rg:B][ch:D][ij:F][nj:C][dl:E]
[rl:A]TR[id][jd][pk]C[Ryzours : I had many possibilities at this point. On the right side, I had two weak groups surrounding a black weak one.  So I could have attacked the weak group to strenghen mines, with moves like A, B, or C.
There was two possible invasion points for black on the left side, wich i'd liked to protect (D and E).
Playing toward the center also semmed a possibility (something like F), which could have multi-purpose (or be useless, i'm not sure).
 Moves like G, I and J also crossed my mind, but I felt uneasy about the possible black invasion at C17, so I decided to settled that first and played H.

Dakre: A is worth considering because it strengthens your group and weakens the black one... but B is inferior, because the upper group is out into the center and doesn't need a base here... C maybe slightly from the wrong direction... same cause... the upper white group is stronger than the lower right... so N8 may be a better move if you want to play from the center.
D and E are much too slow... at this point you still should be happy when black invades there because you get a lot of influence with which you can attack one of the marked groups...
F seems interesting but a bit off it threatens the upper group somehow but it is too far away... the right group is not threatened!! imagine black moving out with something like N9... this would defend that group and attack the white group at the bottom at once so black does not have to worry, but white should...
I don't like G (or G15 as said before is a bit better) because black can live in the corner...
but i do like H and J... I is nothing white has to worry about ( but with O17 black may play L18, but thats no problem for white...
H protects the corner and threantes G15 to become severe!! and J splits the center group and the corner and connects your groups... but i probably would have played around N8 attacking the right group while strengthening the weak white one... it should be sente and white can continue at the top]
;W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[fb];B[gb];W[db]
(;B[gc]C[Ryzours : Now the cut at L17 look more serious. I wanted to strenghen the white top center group quickly.

Dakre: the exchange of F18 and G18 was unfavorable for white i think...]
;W[hb]
(;B[ga];W[md]C[Dakre: the only move!];B[oe];W[ne]LB[nf:A]C[Dakre: black MUST cut at A here!! this is very important... difficult for white now!]

(;B[nd]LB[nf:A]C[Dakre: ... but black doesn't want to ;)];W[mf]
C[Dakre: you were lucky... ;) perfect shape for white now!]
;B[rc]C[Ryzours : I was quite happy with the result of this sequence. My top groups are somewhat alive. I decided it was time to attack the black left center group.

Dakre: yes, white can be really happy with this result... black is confined to the corner and white has it's two weak groups connected! the advantage of black after the fuseki is gone...]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[nj];B[oi];W[ni];B[rm]TR[nl][ol]C[Ryzours: Maybe I attacked from the wrong direction, and as a result the Q7 group was weakened.

Dakre: this seems ok, because you have sente and can concentrate yourself on your only weak group... and black will have a hard time saving the marked group...]
;W[mm];B[nk];W[oj];B[lk];W[ll];B[mk]
(;W[ki]TR[id][jd][he][lk][mk]C[Dakre: i think, this is the wrong direction... splitting the two marked black groups is important, yes, but your lower group needs your attention... black should not be able to connect those groups with one move... (see variations)]
;B[kk]
(;W[ie]C[Dakre: no! these are the wrong priorities... you want to catch those three stones in gote while the rest of blacks group builds perfect influence? this is not a good plan ;) black did well in the game to exploit that mistake...
see the variation for a probably better idea

this was probably the game loosing move... until here you had very good prospects to win.]
;B[hf];W[jf];B[if]C[Dakre: here black gave you the chance to swtich your mind! playing K13 is much better than connecting at K15! see the variation]

;W[jm]C[Dakre: yes, very important... but now black can connect his two weak groups...]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[hj];W[ji];B[jj]C[Ryzours : The Q17 group has a strange shape, I'm not sure it had a lot a eye potential. Even with the use of an sgf editor, it's hard to estimate the living chances of this group, as there are too many possible variations.

Dakre: the Q16 group looks basically alive to me... black can always play S15 when he is in need for a second eye...]
;W[fm]LB[hm:A]C[Dakre: this move may be better placed at A...]
;B[ch];W[eh];B[ce];W[cd];B[cf];W[ci];B[de];W[dg];B[ee];W[cg]
LB[hm:A]C[Dakre: you saw yourself that A is necessary for white :/ not only that white still can cut when connecting at J11...]
;B[on]LB[hm:C][om:A][oo:B]C[Ryzours : Black is at least attacking my group. I had to chose between securing part of it or trying to save it completely. I probably made the wrong choice, but I felt the game was still too close and that I cannot afford to lose many points. Black had still attacks to make and points to take around Q13, b13 or E8. And I was pretty confident about the potential eye shape of my group :-). Even if I couldn't see clearly how to make it live.

Dakre: i can not see how white can live after black played C... :/ so C may be the only option for white now... but even then the game seems close...]

;W[rb];B[re];W[nq];B[nr];C[Ryzours : I spend a lot of time during the few last moves trying to find a good variation with my sgf editor, but I couldn't find one.

Dakre: i couldn't find one too... white seems dead... :/
i want to point out two things which i find most important... the first is that you should probably try harder to estimate the strengths and weaknesses of groups (positional judgement)... this is very important as it decides your strategy during the middlegame...
The second is the cut at J15 which wasn't worth too much but gave black the chance to build a lot of influence... you should have attacked that group on a grander scale...
if you have any questions left feel free to write me an email. I hope the comment is helpful]

A, B, C and D are some options for example...
A is not a good idea because black would play B and white is split and has to worry about too weak groups... white would be the one who is attacked. B pushes black to the top and builds influence... what to do with that influence? maybe attack the upper left group ;)
C is similar to B and D to A...]))
