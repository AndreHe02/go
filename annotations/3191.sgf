C[hello,
playing black, i will mark my comments with "H:"

i am especially interested in mistakes i made on a global scale as there were nearly any fights here.

thanks to the reviewer!

Hi,

I am Juhazi, 8k on EGF(European Go Foundation) scale and I will be your reviewer for this game.

On a global scale you did very well considering your rating. You can see it from the fact that before and after white's invasion got cut off you were in a large lead. Sadly some L&D and reading mistakes got on the way and made the game close.

// Juhazi];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[jp];B[dj]C[Good, stable play. This kind of attitude will take you far.

// Juhazi];W[ck]C[Huge mistake on whites part. Now you get strenght while white gains a few measly points.

// Juhazi];B[dk]C[The right choice.

// Juhazi];W[dl]C[White is starting to have regrets.];B[cj]
LB[el:A]C[What about A instead? The chinese is a moyo opening so in my opinion you should stick to it and perhaps play C10 a few moves later. Hard choice here.

// Juhazi];W[cl];B[qi]C[H: i don't know much about the chinese opening, but one thing i remembered was: if you get both wings, you win. so i was quite happy with that situation but obviously wasn't able to make good use of it.

The move is in the right area at right time too, but perhaps slightly too close to your corner. Q10 would have been my play(probably hoping white would just repeat what he did on the other side :-) ). Not a big mistake at all as the stone still makes a large effect.

// Juhazi];W[pj]C[One of the reasons why play Q10 instead :-(

// Juhazi];B[pi];W[qk];B[nj]LB[fc:2][mc:1][gj:A]C[H: would the left side (around A) would have been a better extension of the moyo?


They seem pretty equal but perhaps developing the right side is more important as Gap #1 is larger than Gap #2 and thus more easily invaded. O10 makes sure that such invasion will be harder.

// Juhazi];W[gk];B[el];W[em];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[il];B[gm]C[H: i was happy to reduce his territory with this like of blacks, but he got the strong walls in exchange. was it the  right decision, to run into his moyo like that?



Yes, it was in my opinion the right decision. Now you can try cutting white while destroying his moyo. note that both white 3-3 points are still open.

// Juhazi];W[hk];B[fj];W[go];B[hn];W[fk];B[ek];W[jn];B[oj];W[ho]

(;B[ol]C[OK, there seems to be something that both of you missed. see variation.

// Juhazi];W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[pl]C[H: this sequence is the one, which later secured his lower right corner. should i have played differently, knowing that?


If you wish to keep the 3-3 point open you should stay away from it. I would say leave this situation as is and come back later for the 3-3 invasion.

J7 is screaming to get played.

;B[kg]C[This cut is good too but you could have cut earlier at J7. Now it looks dangerous due to strong K10.]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[lc];B[nc];W[ji];B[mi];W[li];B[mh]
;W[gj];B[fi];W[gi]C[H: i must have maken some mistakes in the following sequence as white gets a lot of territory on the upper side


White should be dead, yes :-)

// Juhazi];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[ie];B[je];W[jd];B[hf];W[id]
(;B[kd]LB[gd:A][nf:B]SQ[hc]C[H: i should better have defended the left or right side (A or B), right?



Actually, the best move in my opinion would have been the calm and peaceful Fatality of an extension at H17.

Both sides are in excellent shape, only small piece of danger comes from J17 stone, so that is what needs to be defended.

// Juhazi];W[ld]C[Still H17... capturing that stone does not give white an eye. see variations.

;B[ap]C[H: after this corner, there were just endgame moves, and i strongly believe that i could have made a few more points here which would have made me win.


The endgame has been going on for a while before this point ;-)

I did not really spot any endgame mistakes that can be found without a book and in reasonable time. Apart from D17, quite normal end of the endgame. In my opinion the scores are quite set from this point forward.
