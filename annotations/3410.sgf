This game was one intense corker. After over an hour of intense thinking from my opponent and I the game ended, with me barely clinching a victory (I consider any win less than 10 points close). Though this was supposed to be another one of my 5-3 experimental games, it turned itno a heated battle.

Also, could you point out some good yose moves to me?

Thanks for taking time to review my game!

Finland.


Prib: Just a little about me.  I'm about a 10kyu player.((i have two account in KGS [8K and 12k\])).  i am  indonesian and not really good in english, so i hope u can understand my comment even if it`s didn`t speel right ^_^]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[ce];W[pp]
(;B[ch]C[XCM: Yes, I know this is slow, but something still tells me that it's not bad. I know that there may be better moves around, but i stress, it's an experiment :)!

Prib: All the same, what other moves would you recommend at this stage?]
;W[ed]C[XCM: Ah, something different. Usually white would play at D17. I believe in this case white took into account the C12 stone. However, he does allow me to take the corner rather easily. Thoughts?

Prib: like u says, D17 is ussuall place, and  better place for white. it`s because left side was yours (with C12) white can`t give u upper-left this easy, or u will got very nice upperleft-left combination that uninvadeable.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[dd]
(;W[jd];B[ee]TR[jd]C[XCM: K16 was a little confusing, but i reaoned that the E16 unit wasn't fully settled yet, which is why i played the not-so-attractive move of E15. Thoughts?


Prib:
Right, E15 is vital point for both,i think u play the best move here
and another reason why K16 is bad, is because he need extra stone to connect with E16.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[nc]
(;B[oe]TR[nc]C[XCM: Hmm, i don't know. Perhaps i was thinking of attacking the O17 stone at the time. However, upon reflection, i now think that it wasn't all that good a move. Thoughts?

Prib: i think it was bad move, to soft for an attack, but not much help the defend too (it doesn`t make base for black at all!)]
;W[pj]C[XCM: Yes, now white looks very ahead.]
(;B[jq]C[XCM: I reasoned that i needed to attack now before white's framework became to large. Was K3 good? Is there a better?

------
Prib: K3 was very ussuall place to invade in white position, ur comment in move 19th say u already know the reason why..

Prib: yes there is a better place.. it is F3. because it push white to your strong group.]
;W[gq];B[mq]C[XCM: Obviously if white took one side i'd take base on the other. Thoughts?]
;W[oq];B[pm]C[XCM: I seemed to be taking a few risks so early on in the game. But i believed that it was necessary, lest white makes more territory. Opinions?

Prib: not this time, ur Q16 can easyly counter-attacked by white if he answer correct]

(;W[qn]C[too defendsive-minded]
(;B[ql]C[XCM: Here, am i digging a deeper wound? Or a deeper grave?]

(;W[pg]C[XCM: Should I have protected my corner? If so, which side first? And if not, how should I run?

Prib: it`s better to protect from right side first, because it is more sente. a move like R14 may be better now.]

(;B[pb]C[XCM: Just protecting the corner...];W[qe];B[qd];W[me]
;B[nf];W[ip];B[ko]C[XCM: Is the knight's move here alright or should i have played along J3 first to dig deeper? Or is there another way to jump into the center

Prib: not sure, but i prefered one point jump, in N5.];W[ck]
C[XCM: Ack. I think white is quite ahead at this point.];B[cm]
C[XCM: Ooh, another risky manouvre (did i spell that right ?:P). Was this too much? Is there a better place?]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[ek];B[bk]C[XCM: I believe this was enough to keep my C7 group connected. Is my thinking wrong?

Prib: i am not sure black can connect with B9.. i think it`s easyly cutted by white B10]

(;W[jp];B[kp];W[di];B[bi]C[XCM: Ah, i think i made a mistake here. Is B10 supposed to be the correct move? Any other suggestions?

Prib: yes, B10 make C7 connected with C12 and that things is absolutely good for black]
;W[bl]
(;B[dk];W[dj];B[cl]C[XCM: I thought long and hard before making this move. Though it does make an empty triangle, it was the only move i could come up with. Thoughts?]
;W[dl];B[cj];W[bm]
(;B[el]C[XCM: Rather than fight the ko at D9, i decided to run into the centre. I force white to connect at D11 before running further. But "Weak players avoid ko, Strong players seek it" goes the saying. I guess i'm a weak player, huh? Or was my strategy reasonable?

Prib: i don`t agree, i say it again that connection here will makes  big different for black. because u can play aggresively only if ur D7 group is strong. that can use for either to reduce white corner or kill D10 group.

so, i reccomended u to play ko.

P.S: u take the first ko here, so white need extra ko treath to won this ko.]
;W[dk];B[fm];W[dn];B[em];W[gk]C[Prib: because F7 group is weak, u need to run, otherwise if it`s strong u can play F11 stone.]

;W[nh];B[og];W[oh];B[ph]TR[rf][pg][qg][rg]C[XCM: Did i screw up here? Or was there really no way for me to take the four white stones?

Prib: u can`t take the four white stones.];W[qh];B[pi];W[qi]
;B[oi];W[nj]C[XCM: Double Ack. I didn't see the net here. However, i think i utilised its aji quite well. What do you think?]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nm];W[ol];B[nk];W[om];B[pk]C[XCM: Ultra firey conflict. I think my escape to the centre was close.]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[pn];B[nl];W[on];B[pl];W[lh];B[mi]
(;W[ni]C[XCM: I believe white didn't need to capture those 3 immediately. Or did he see something i didn't?

Prib: maybe better for white to play N10 first];B[mj];W[mh]

(;B[ih]C[XCM: I needed to claim some centre territory and reduce white's influence. Was J12 good enough? Are there better moves?


--------
Prib: not bad , but i think side is more important because not many sente move in center. 

Prib: i prefered move in J3.];W[hg];B[jg];W[ng];B[mf];W[lf]
;B[eg]C[XCM: Maybe i was being desperate. Maybe i was greedy. But i was thinking i could kill the white stones over here ( i failed in the end :P). What do you think?

Prib: to late now, ur move here just make u lost the control (gote?)]

;B[kj]C[XCM: Take the centre. At this stage, i believe the game is still in white's favour.]
;W[ke]C[XCM: Gote move? Should i have played something other than O15?]
;B[ne];W[md];B[kg];W[lg];B[bo]C[XCM: Ah, i thought this was really good :D! Force white to take C6, then invade at 3-3! However, it ended in seki... Still, it was a great reduction :D]

(;B[eq]C[Prib: F2 is better shape.];W[fq]
(;B[er]C[Prib: F2 is better shape];W[im]C[XCM: Ooh, payback time from white. Now he's making a reduction. I played at J6, but was there a better move?


----------------
Prib: again because D7 group is not solid, u cannot cut the J7

Prib: i found there is a way to trade your F7 with big territory and strong K3 group.]
