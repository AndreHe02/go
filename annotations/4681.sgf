[np:B][nq:A]TR[jp]C[This is a joseki, but I think that it gives black an advantage on this board.  
This joseki would be ideal if white *already* had a stone around K4.
Otherwise, according to theory, the outcome will be in black's favour.

Better would be to play a shimari or a pincer: A, B, or something around C.]
;B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[qj];W[np]TR[qj]C[White ends in gote, black now has a stable group, and the R10 stone, which is working well with Q16.]

(;B[iq]C[J3 is understandable, but I think it is out of envy and not as good as K16.  The K16 area is much bigger.]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[oq];W[nq];B[lq];W[om]C[It seems that P3 had much more destructive potential that I thought.

DAB> it is a light stone.  I like white's response to it here so far.  But white must have a plan if/when black decides to make use of P3.]
;B[pl]TR[kc]C[White played L17 next, which is a big move.  However, the bottom of the board is very active and white should either press black's J3 group and profit by making it weaker, or fix white's P6 group first.
I'm thinking, something like the following sequence:]
(;W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[je]LB[ke:A]C[normally K15 is at A.  I see why there is a knight's move here, but I'm not familiar with this idea.  
pressure on J17?  But J17 is very strong, and white has the weaker group here I think.  If F16 was absent, then I would say ok.]

(;B[bo]C[this probe is very premature I think. F3 is the better move to approach D4.
It is tempting, but very likely a gross exaggeration to suggest that this is move shifts the game into a winning position for white. 

See variation.];W[bq];B[bc]C[odd, why does black play the probe and then a move like this.  Granted, B17 is fairly big (8-10 points?) but B5 is about to be consumed.]

(;W[cd]C[C16 seems rather slow.

dab>  Agreed.  You can ignore B17 and crush B5 I think.  See variation.]
;B[ck]C[alas, B5 escapes.  Still, white is not in a bad situation.]

(;W[cn]C[With C6 I wanted to build a big wall towards the center in exchange for letting B5 connect to C9 and live small at the side.

dab> if white wants power in the centre, why is he playing on the 3rd line?  This is not for centre usually.  See variation.]
;B[bn];W[cm]
(;B[bm]C[this seems so submissive for black.  B5 is more interesting as a probe to be sacrificed than seen as a stone to make a group out of.]

(;W[gq];B[bi]C[a nice move for black.];W[bh];B[ah];W[bg];B[gp]
C[This is a nice move by black.  It touches a strong stone (g3) and seems to help the weak black group while neutralizing white's wall.  It makes me think that my previous idea of black defending at M6 is much inferior.]

(;W[fp]C[F4 feels too close to white's own thickness. See variation.]
;B[go];W[hq];B[io]C[now black looks pretty stable to me.];W[hp]
C[The sequence from H4 gets some points at lower side, but it keeps all black stones connected. Maybe there's a better way of taking advantage of black's weakness here.

>dab:  After the H3 J5 exchange, black doesn't look that weak anymore to me.  See previous variation.]

(;W[jq];B[kq];W[jr]
(;B[kr];W[jo];B[kp]C[nice cut.];W[ir]C[Instead of J2, cutting with K6 would put a lot of pressure on black, but I took territory in sente instead of risking a fight. I felt that I'm leading (miscalculating P3 influenced that too), so I didn't want to risk.


I can't tell who is ahead.  black has more profit in terms of solid territory, but white has power over weak groups.]
;B[kn]C[I don't think this is a working net.]
(;W[hm]C[The plan was something like a ladder breaker to cut F8 group in sente. Or if it connected in the end, to make it difficult enough that I would get a nice wall in exchange.

>dab: just extend.  I could not find a way for black to capture K5 with L6]
;B[jn];W[de]C[Taking advantage of sente, I'm trying to finish enclosing the center left. I wasn't sure yet, whether F8 group would be in the enclosure or not, it still felt like a lot of points.]
