;W[nq];B[pj];W[fq]C[White is putting a new stone directly under the attack of two other stones, plus, black gets to make the next move. It's three on one.]
;B[er]C[Q: Too low? I wanted to protect the corner, so I played there. But maybe E3 was better...

A: I feel that this either makes White F3 too light, or make it strengthen itself. I think D6 itself is enough pressure. If white strengthens, you have to be careful of K5 at some point.]

;B[hc]LB[qc:A]C[Q: Maybe I should have played N16, now white N16 is a big move... and he saw it.
A: White N16 is not as big a move as you think, since black has A, black can take away the corner in sente (about 10 points) while white secures a territory of about 14 or 15 points. Hardly a bad trade, considering there's 2 white stones on the top right to start with.]
