FG[259:]PM[2];B[ce];W[ee]C[In 9x9 goban this central move is wrong?

== Pedro ==
I think it is very right for Black (at her first move)!
Not sure I like it so much now :)];B[ec];W[cg]LB[df:A]SQ[dg]
C[This move aims the corner territory. It's correct considering the position?

== Pedro ==
This is a strange position ...
and I don't like the idea of Black coming through these White stones (at A),
I probably would play on the square];B[ge];W[gc]TR[fd]SQ[dd]
CR[df]C[The white piece in g7 can be isolated or captured, considering the black pieces at e7 and g5?

== Pedro ==
Probably not captured, but it can be isolated (at the triangle) ...
the triangle also isolates the two black stones

and the square another two
and the circle two white stones];B[eg];W[de];B[cd];W[cf];B[fd]
;W[dd]TR[de][ee]C[== Pedro ==
empty triangle :)
but you reinforced the two very weak white stones on line 5]

(;W[fc]LB[ff:A]C[This move aims to build a living group at the corner, considering the cutting move f6. It's correct?

== Pedro ==
I think the bottom right corner is more important now.

Maybe better to play at A and let Black attack the top right corner]

better at A for that]

Yes, A would have been better];W[be]C[New atari at a5...];B[bd]

No, not this time];W[ad]

A protects the triangled stones at the expense of a few points]

I like C7 more];B[ci];W[bi]C[Is c7 better?

yes];B[ed];W[fe]C[Is c7 better?

hmmmm ... maybe not -- you are menacing too big a cut];B[ff]
