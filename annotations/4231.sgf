C[Dear reviewer,

I am Amygdala, 2k IGS. Off the Go board, my name is Christoph Klawe. Thank you for taking time to review this game.
I began my remarks and questions with an "A".
In the course of pre-reviewing the game, I made out several problems, which are probably impediments on my way to improvement:
1.
Difficulties in using thickness and with a series of hanes (moves 34-49).
2.
A poor Yomi. I can hardly read more than 10 moves ahead.
3.
Moving out with unimportant stones and the ensuing difficulties (moves 53-96).
4.
Missing opportunities.

If you will find out more specific difficulties that I can work on, I would be grateful for any hints.]

C[A:
I guess this is a little exaggerated. Maybe the conventional move at C10 is better. What is your opinion?

R:
The white three stones are too heavy right now for you to leave them; if you wanted to play something like this, do so before connecting at D14. At this stage, I would stick with C10.]
;B[cl];W[en]C[My instinct that this point is to backpincer at C10 and see what black does. For black to play C11 is too painful.]
;B[fp]C[Black's mistake.];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj]C[A:
Is it better to crawl along at D11? I got scared about the possibility of black D8 or D7, but in retrospect I think that was irrational, wasn't it?

R: You can just play along with black at D11. D8 reverts to the regular sequence, and D7 is somewhat pointless: it gives white a stronger wall while keeping the corner weakness (C3).
If you really don't like losing the C6 stone, you may also try to make the exchange White F5, Black G4 first and then play D11.]
;W[dl];B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[eh];B[cg];W[dg];B[bg];W[bf];B[bi]
;W[hq];B[bo];W[bn]C[This move is too small; both black groups are pretty much invulnerable, so there isn't a point in separating them; I would try to seal the black in (G5) or take the upper right corner.]
;B[co]C[This move is too small for black];W[go]C[A:
I was satified with the result so far. White got a lot of influence. The only bad thing is that white loses sente. G5 does not have any immediate impact on black. Do you go along with that assessment?]
;B[fg];W[ed]C[A:
I assumed that the variation would follow. But that would have been to easy. Anyway white cannot connect at E13, that would be too docile.

R:
Peeping here isn't very meaningful. Just connect ing at E13 would do fine. Attacking your opponent so aggressively is slightly dangerous since there are several cutting points on your wall.]

(;B[fd];W[ec];B[eb]C[A:
Only now I noticed that I cannot cut at F18 the way I liked. For the first time in this match, I was impressed by the art of the black player.

R: It's clever, but still going a bit beyond his ability]
(;W[fe];B[ge]
(;W[gf]C[Consider cutting at D18, creating variation...];B[he]
C[black should have ataried instead, to leave trouble for white.]
;W[ff];B[hf];W[hg]C[Pointless, get upper right corner!];B[ig]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[hh];B[ji]C[A:
This must be a very bad development for white, as he is horribly overconcentrated. His influence is almost annihilated. How could white have done better? Where did white go wrong?

R:
#1, he had the chance to play a sequence that led up to the cut at G16 (see earlier variation)
#2, he could have ignored black H14 and played at the top right corner. It's big!
#3, it's not that bad for white, I still see a weakness for black, though it can't be exploited immediately.]

(;W[if];B[jg];W[kf]TR[ig][jg][jh][ji]C[A:
I think that was unreasonable. Probably white should have played at the Hoshi Q17. But I felt it was unbearably painful to accept that the white influence is erased but the four triangled black stones remain connected to their fellows. What is your opinion?

R:
See earlier comment. Also, you should not use up all aji immediately. Keep some to use according to future situation.]
;B[ie];W[jf];B[kd];W[mf];B[md]C[A:
This is like "pseudo-hunting" the black stones along the 4th line, but it is the white group that is weak!

R: I would have played at M13 instead of N14, it exerts a bit more pressure on the black 4 stones.]
;W[jk]C[A:
I thought that that might be the right use of the white center thickness.

R:
Forget the center thickness. Thicknesses are not used to surround territory (you do start out by building a wall around the territory you want, it's too slow), but for fights. What you should do is to drive your opponent towards your thickness with moves like M12 or M11.]
;B[mh];W[of];B[pd]
(;W[qf]C[A:
Instead I thought of turning like in the previous variation. I was also worried about the wedge-in black M14, but as far as I can figure it out (see variation), this does not work for black at the moment.]

(;B[qe];W[pf]C[Don't bother connecting. That stone isn't really important.]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[oh];W[jd]C[A:
White tries to make life with his group. Perhaps white R12 would be the proper first move.

R:
White can make life by extending at R11, and get a bit of territory in the points. It is not easy to kill an opponent who has so much room to run about.]
;B[je];W[ke];B[le];W[lf];B[jc]C[I still see a structural weakness in black.]
;W[od]C[Leave this unplayed.];B[oc];W[ni]C[A:
As often in situations like that, I do not know if this is Aji-keshi or Kikashi. As the peep leads to no special advantage later on, I tend to think of it as Aji-keshi. What is your opinion?

R:
Personally, I get the impresison that the peep slightly strengthens the black group, especially when regarding the fact that the toup white group isn't alive yet.]
;B[nh];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[rg]TR[qi]C[A:
Should white have taken the triangled stone with R10 instead?

R:
And what if black counterattacks?];B[qj];W[me];B[ld];W[oe];B[nd]
C[Stupid move by black. Leaving too many cuts to save a single stone.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[re];B[rd];W[qd];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb];W[pe]C[A:
I felt a little relieved now, as the white group was definitely alive, but black has got a large and secure territory. White, on the other hand, has no real chance to attack the black center group.]
;B[pj];W[qp];B[qn]C[A:
This extension felt a little narrow now, so white was satisfied.

White is not satisfied because white doesn't have enough territory.]
;W[on];B[ij]C[Black is strengthening the white position now. Black can play somewhere like O3 and has a pretty good chance of making life.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[hk];B[fj];W[gk];B[ej];W[eg]C[A:
Do you see any better way to give life to the white group?

R:
I would play E10 instead of G9. What's black going to do?];B[gj]

(;W[dm]C[A:
I was quite unhappy with this move, because it was purely defensive, but I disliked a black Hane at the same spot a lot. How would I have answered it? Should I rather Tenuki and play like in the variation instead?

R: I agree that the alternative looks much better];B[mm];W[mo]
C[I'd exchange at P8 first; If black plays at N9, you have the hoice of cutting off black at R8 later on. When you play N5 first, black may respond at R8 when you play P8 later on.]
;B[om]C[...or he may not give you a chance at all.];W[lm];B[nn]
;W[ll];B[mk]C[black doesn't gain much territory by playing here, especially when white has sentes at K10 and M11.]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[nj]C[Ouch for black!]
(;W[fr]C[A:
Now I got not much time left and thought that I should take all big Sente moves I could make out. Can white reduce the black group in a better way and keep Sente?

R:
See variations.];B[er];W[gr];B[eq];W[ro];B[rn];W[ri];B[rj];W[es]
C[Sente, but not very big. I'd leave this for later.];B[ds]
;W[fs];B[cr];W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[bq]
(;W[ac]C[A:
Probably bad, I think. White can successfully cut at D18 as in the variations. Is that true?

R:
Yep! Although I'd try a different sequence, as shown in previous variations.]
;B[bc];W[ad];B[ab];W[ae];B[cb];W[ak]C[A:
Can I kill the black group? I did not find a way.

R: Doesn't look like you can.];B[aj];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[ch]
C[Largest way for black to make life: A13.

Yes, I know htat obsession with half a point is pathetic. But that's what professionals fight over (and no, it usually doesn't make a difference in my games. But I scrape every part of a point anyways).]
;W[oo]TR[ac][ec][ad][ed][ae][de][fe][bf][cf][df][ff][gf][dg]
[eg][hg][eh][hh][ih][ei]C[A:
A very bad mistake: at least from now on black can kill the triangled white stones with the sequence in the variation! But none of us noticed... As E15 is perhaps an unusual beginning, this might make a nice Tsume-go problem.  Apart from that, white loses Sente.

R:
Nice point! I missed it myself.]

(;W[lk];B[no];W[np];B[mn];W[ln];B[qo];W[rp];B[pn]
(;W[po]C[A:
The endgame is alittle erratic, I am afraid. This white move is not big enough and Gote again, isn't it?

2 points in gote. Ignoring O9, I would play T10 (sente in any case) and then T18. See variation.]
;B[fo];W[fn];B[gp];W[hp];B[si];W[nk];B[oj];W[ol];B[ok];W[pm]
;B[nl];W[dd]C[A:
And only now I notice that this group can be killed. I could have gambled a little, but that would not have been right, I felt.

R:
No need to gamble: You're winning.];B[pl];W[rm];B[qm]
(;W[mp]TR[hp][hq][fr][gr][es][fs]C[A:
I thought about the variation, but was unable to read it out until the end: in fact, there wasn't any danger, right?

R: None whatsoever. Marked white stones already have a pretty decent eyeshape, if that's what you were worrying about. Btw, I would have played T6 instead of S7, since it's sente and black has S11 stone in atari.]
;B[rh];W[qg]C[The stone wasn't quite big enough for you to connect]
;B[so];W[sp];B[sn];W[kh]C[A:
Finally I hallucinated that I could cut there.];B[kg];W[lh]
;B[lg];W[ki];B[mg]C[A:
Anyway white ends in Sente and black will have to take at P11 later on, which is nice.]

(;W[fk]C[A:
Once more I could not read properly and was afraid of the variation. But again, I did not have to be scared.]

;B[bj];W[am];B[ag];W[bd];B[sg];W[sf];B[sh];W[be];B[cc];W[tt]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[A:
Because of the server functions, we did not fill in Dame and so black did not take at P11... White gave 6.5 Komi and in the end black won by 4.5 moku (in fact: 3.5).

R's final comments:
Close game, you had several chances at shattering black but didn't quite make it. I would advise you to do a lot of life and death problems because you can never have enough calculating power, even if you're a strong professional player. The disadvantage of the lack of calculation powers are two-fold: you miss some opportunities and you shrink from others out of uncertainty.
Hope my comments are helpful.])
