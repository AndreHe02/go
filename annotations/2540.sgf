SilentLamb [6k\]: hi gg

chalmo [5k\]: enjoy];B[cp]C[B: This game was decided rather early on. I see three points were white might be able to improve his game: 



1. White should not let himself get closed in in the opening. Territory is important, but also influence is important. Having much influence means, you have the advantage in fights which might later break out, and it also means that you will be able to get territory later.



2. There is the diagonal move toward the center. (Kozumi). In many circumstances it is a strong move. The one point jump toward the center can also be good, but always look if the diagonal is better.



3. If your oponent makes moves which look like threats against your group, dont just defend all the time. Look if oponents move really is sente. If it doesnt threaten the life of the group, but only threatens to take away some of your points, it might be better to make a big move elsewere. Just think about it: If your oponent makes a move which vaguely looks like sente but it is not strictly sente, he expects you to answer. If you dont answer it might be like a blow to him.]

;W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[do];W[br]C[B: So far your opening is very good! But I do not agree with your move B2 here. F5 is absolutely necessary! If black is allowed to build a wall facing upwards, that is going to fit in well with his stone on D17. F5 also threatens the stone on G3. F5 (the diagonal move, Kozumi) is a very important move here. 

Dont let yourself be closed in!];B[fn];W[bp]C[This going to be Gote. It is nice to have a base, but here it is more important to get out. I think F5 would still be good.]
;B[bo];W[aq];B[eo]C[Suddenly black has the better position. His influence is far more worth then your points in the corner.]
;W[cn]C[I would keep moves like that in reserve. Black will not play here. so you can play this move later in the game. maybe later in the game you would want to use this black weakness differently. Or you need a Ko threat.]
;B[co];W[fp];B[ho];W[jq]C[Here you are playing the right direction. But the point is just a little wrong. It is not really a threat against the knight move (G4/H5). And it is also not the ideal distance to your stones P3/P4.

J3 would be the vital point for an attack against the knight move. L3 would be an ideal extension from your stones. Both moves would be better. 

One possible sequence: white L3, Black J3, White L5

Another sequence: 

White J3 Black H4 white K5 or K4.



I think I like white L3 better.];B[lq]C[Now you are in trouble as you cannot really cut the knight move.]
;W[jo]C[you should play L4 (the diagonal move, Kozumi). It would be a strong attack against M3. Here jumping into the middle can not be good. Black has to much influence. Also if black also jumps out, you will have two weak groups.]
;B[lo]C[I think Black has already won here. You got two weak groups and no influence. It is going to be very hard for white.]
;W[on]C[Good!];B[ml];W[jm];B[jp];W[ip];B[kp];W[hp];B[io];W[in]
C[This can not work out well. Your three stones in the center are floating in the center with little hope. Treat them lightly! at the moment the threatening cut at G4 is most urgent. Play G4 or G5!

You can not allow black to capture your stones H4, J4.



Your moves now dont fit with your last move H4. If you want to keep those central stones, you should have played J5 instead of H4. After J5 there would have still been the threat of a cut through blacks knight move. So you would have kept all your stones (that line would have been far better then the line in your game, but I could not recommend that line either, as the stones have no base.)]
;B[hn];W[hm];B[gp]C[This is a very bad result!

Black has no weak stones on this side anymore. Black is far ahead in influence, and I dont think you are much ahead in territory (if at all). I think here the game is completely lost. From now on you are catching up a little but not enough.]
;W[qq];B[qm];W[qf]C[Against all that black influence the tight move R15 would have been better.]
;B[pe]C[This moves seems to help you.];W[qe];B[pd];W[qd];B[md]
;W[oc];B[ne]C[This is a good result for you!];W[cf];B[ch];W[cc]
;B[cd];W[dd];B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[ed];B[ce];W[db];B[ee];W[fd]
;B[ao]C[This black move is to small. Black sould continue to press with F15.]
;W[fl]C[This stone can easily be cut off with Black G7. It is also the wrong direction. F15 would be a good move. It would keep the black moyo small. If black plays F15 he gets a big moyo.]
;B[dl]C[This is an overly defensive black move.];W[ej];B[gm]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[gk]C[The white position collapses];B[hk]C[It looks as if white has to loose either his central stones or his scattered stones on the left side.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi];W[fg];B[fe]C[This is a very important point. If black keeps your left corner stones seperated from the center you dont have any power in the center. A typical situation: One player has four corners and the other players wins because he is so strong in influence.]
;W[hg];B[ii];W[kj];B[kk];W[ji];B[il];W[im];B[jl];W[kl];B[jk]
C[White has lost his center stones. But the were rather hopeless anyway. It would have been better to treat them lightly from the beginning. If white would have tried to keep them (e.g. instead of H13) the loss on the left side4 would probably have been even bigger. I think anyway: It is more important who gets the next move at G16/G15. This is the crucial point of the game right now.]
;W[lk];B[jj];W[ll]C[It would be better to treat those stones lightly. You cannot expect much here.]
;B[mk]C[No good move either];W[mm];B[km];W[lm];B[kn];W[mj];B[nj]
;W[mi];B[oo]C[Black is playing in the wrong area. Black G16 is huge. Black could then attack the scattered white stones on the left side.]
;W[no];B[po];W[mp]C[This move is not necessary. The cut at O4 is not threatening. A move of defense which is not really necesssary. Those moves can cost a lot of points, as you are loosing the initiative.]
;B[mq]C[Also a very small move. Because of that weak answer you didnt loose anything with your last move.]
;W[ge]C[Good! Black has missed a good oportunity.];B[gd];W[he]
;B[gc];W[fb];B[id];W[eh];B[bf];W[ci];B[dh];W[di];B[df];W[rp]
C[Good!];B[ro];W[rq];B[pn];W[om]C[This is to small. Dont defend every stone! Black is not threatening much here. (In this region O7 would be bigger as it threatens two stones. But I would not play in this region at all).

You are far behind in the game. Try an attack like L16. Or make big moves like R11 or O11.]
;B[fi];W[ei];B[bk];W[jf]C[Good! Prepares the ground for L16.]
;B[gb];W[ec]C[Think carefull before you make such a move. Wasting an unnecessary move in defense can cost the game. I dont think G18 was sente against your corner. So do not answer it in the corner! This is a wasted move. As there are so many big points (L16, O16, O11,B12) I think this move easily costs you 10 points or more. If you avoid those costly moves you will get much stronger.]
;B[ke];W[je];B[jd];W[kd];B[kc];W[kf];B[le];W[mb];B[lb];W[ki]
C[What follows is endgame. I will not give much comments on that as it does not decide the game.]
;B[qh];W[oj];B[ol];W[ni];B[nm];W[nn];B[nl];W[pi]C[Good!];B[qj]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[qk]C[This allows black to defend his weakness. S12 is better (black has probably to defend at S10 and you play S13 for some points of territory. Maybe before  plaing S12 you should play Q14  what black probably answers.]
;B[rk];W[pk];B[ql];W[nr];B[nq];W[fr];B[gr];W[fq];B[ph];W[nk]
C[The biggest question left on the board is: Gets white the "touchdown" on the left side (by playing B12?) or can black connect at B11. Most moves now of black and white are small compared to that.]
