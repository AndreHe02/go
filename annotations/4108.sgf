C[buckyyowza: Hi Hans.  I'm Mark Fyffe and will preceed my comments with "buckyyowza".  I hope you enjoy reading my commentary as much as I enjoyed looking through your game :-)

Dear reviewer,

My name is Hans. I played this with White on KGS and lost by a huge margin. This is a moyo against moyo type of game where it is not quite obvious at which point territory gets made or lost. At move 76, the game already seems decided. I added some of my own thoughts, but I really wonder at which point I lost this game in your view, and what better moves you would recommend.  Thank you for reviewing this !]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq]
(;W[ec]LB[nc:C][pj:B][jp:A]C[buckyyowza: when playing white, more so than with black, your priorities are to a) get sente, b) keep sente, and finally c) don't lose sente (until you're well ahead).  Here, white plays a mirror play to black's big gote (R4).  By nature of this play, it also is gote and establishes even footing for both players, so the advantage goes to whoever has sente... that is, whoever's turn it is.  After black plays shimari (P3/R4), the big points on the board are K4 and Q10 (K3/R10 are also as big).  However, these are not urgent since they are not sente; and if black takes one then white can take the other.  K4 is simple for white already, but Q10 might be a little more difficult without some support... therefore, I'd approach the upper right corner now with O17, see variation for how this might work.]
;B[pj]
(;W[dj]LB[nc:C][jp:A][jq:B]C[buckyyowza: The area around K4 is more interesting to prevent the dreaded double wing shimari formation.  White's best options at this point are K4, K3, and O17.  I'd still prefer O17 (see var) because black will have to pincer or allow white the double-wing formation with a strong extension along the upper side (actually, as happens in the game).  Generally, it is good strategy for black to always take the big point and let white fight it out, but this doesn't work as well for white because the big points are a bit more scarce.

Black greets me with my own opening. I was thinking of alternatives here, but could not find any.]

(;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]C[buckyyowza: Here is black's first mistake:  This is already a center game, so this corner is too small to be worth playing a 2nd line slide already.  Of course black's play is joseki, but it is not a good fit here.  Now a high approach like N16 or O16 is in order for white to emphasize thickness, then white can play something like M4 in sente (after finishing the joseki, of course).]

(;W[jd]LB[hp:B][cq:A][iq:C]C[buckyyowza: this is big, but it is best not to leave C3.  after white C3, black will need to play H4 or J3 to complete the joseki, so you can come back to K16 after that.]
;B[ip]C[buckyyowza: should be J3.];W[nc];B[qf];W[jj]LB[mm:A]
[cq:B]SQ[nj][jm][pm][mp]C[buckyyowza: tengen is big, but here it is not deep enough.  For example, a stone at N7 can extend to any of the marked points so it is not only a guaranteed a large reduction, it also has an easy escape route.  K10 now only helps black to build a huge, impenetrable moyo in the lower right.  Since white is down a stone at C3 and is a bit overconcentrated in the upper left, black now leads by about 30 points... though I'd hardly say that the game is over; it is only more of a challenge now than it should have been ;-)

My tenuki after D2 allowed me to take tengen. Now I felt like I was leading.]
;B[cj]
(;W[di]LB[ci:A]C[buckyyowza: white needs the left side, so should hane this stone directly, at C11.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[bh]
(;W[cg]C[buckyyowza: this is too easy on black - white is already thick, why not use the thickness instead of building more while black gets easy life on your left side?]
;B[bg];W[cf];B[pb];W[ck];B[bk]
(;W[bj]LB[bl:A]C[buckyyowza: This play is ajikeshi, white should B8 directly now.]
;B[bi];W[bl];B[aj];W[cl]C[buckyyowza: Black gets an easy invasion in sente, now the game is his ;-)  See var on #28 for the correct sequence.

I wonder if the whole action was worth taking gote.];B[lc]
(;W[jc]C[buckyyowza: your thinking is not bad: L17 accomplishes the same thing, but retains sente.

Maybe I should have played M16. I'm sacrificing O17 for sente, planning to expand my moyo southward eastward. Too much of a sacrifice ?]
;B[md]
(;W[jm]LB[mm:A]C[buckyyowza: K7 is not bad, but N7 is best now - it reduces the right or the lower side. Black can decide which.  I wouldn't recommend your variations here, they give black too much of the lower right too easily.

I looked at alternatives (variation), but could not find anything satisfying.]
;B[fn]LB[jg:C][dk:A][lp:B]C[buckyyowza: This is black's second big mistake.  D9 is already a cutting point and a simple solid play like M4 is apropriate to counter K7.  White's moyo is easily reduced at K13, so it is not urgent to reduce it from this direction.]
;W[fl];B[jg]
(;W[lf]LB[ql:C][mm:A][pm:B]C[buckyyowza: black is in after K13.  The best local play is J14 to minimize the reduction, however reducing black's lower right is a more interesting idea, so I'd tenuki now and play N7, Q7, R8, etc.  Any play like M14, L14, etc will only help black make a stronger reduction.

This looks like a blunder. L14 is more stable (variation).]

;B[gg];W[hf];B[ij]
(;W[jh]C[buckyyowza: L10 and M15 are both good here.

taking a move that looks like sente, but is probably inferior to K9 or L10.
I was also a considerung M15 (variation) taking back the territory I sacrificed, but opponent kept me so busy that I couldn't find time.]
;B[jk];W[ii]
(;B[kj];W[ji];B[hk];W[il];B[ik]C[buckyyowza: this whole exchange is too good for black.  white needs M15 or H13 to escape the L12 stones, and G7 to save the K7 stones.  Black will be happy to swallow either one.  K12 is where white dropped the stone he needed to remedy this situation.]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[jl];W[ll];B[km];W[lm];B[kn];W[mo]LB[ph:C]
[pl:B][pm:A]TR[il][jm]C[buckyyowza: This is a difficult direction for white to attack.  Black need only play at M4 to seal the lower side.  Q7/Q8 looks best to me now.  The following plays from there should allow a better chance to invade the lower side or even something like Q12.

Of course I must get compensation in Blacks sphere of influence, but since his is not a central moyo, it is much harder to invade than mine.]
;B[hh];W[mq]C[buckyyowza: black H12 cut off one of white's easy escape routes, so white should play M15 now.  Also, white shouldn't play N3 until protecting against the cut at M6.]

(;B[kq];W[ff];B[le];W[ql]LB[mf:B][pl:A]C[buckyyowza: White is considerably behind, true, but there is no point in giving up now!  It is difficult to get stronger if you insist on every game being a clean win by move 76 :-)  There is is plenty of aji on the board for white to close the gap to 10 points or better... and black still has to manage to maintain his lead without many mistakes.  R8 is a good idea, though I'd still prefer Q8 to better play off of your big dragon.  However, N14 is urgent to answer black M15 so it should come first.

I'll be playing all the big spots now, but still I'm behind by a considerable margin. So probably the game is lost. Later opponent dropped R4 group and gave me winning chances, but that is another story.]
;B[qj];W[gm];B[cq];W[kp];B[jp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm]
LB[pm:A]TR[pn][po]C[buckyyowza: Q7 is better, otherwise black can cut the marked stones in sente.]

(;B[op]
(;W[oo]LB[nn:A]TR[pn][po]C[buckyyowza: The empty triangle is nearly always to be avoided.  O6 is more efficient to accomplish the same thing.]
;B[mf];W[gj];B[gk];W[fj];B[fk];W[ek];B[hj];W[fo]LB[hm:A]C[buckyyowza: To play in this area, you might as well finish off what you started and play at H7.]
;B[bo]C[buckyyowza: white's yose in the next moves leaves too much weakness, as can been seen later in the game.  I'll try to suggest alternatives.]
;W[cp]C[buckyyowza: one point sente, but loses white 1 liberty. this is best left for later.]
;B[bp];W[gp]LB[go:A]C[buckyyowza: G5 is much more solid, and allows white to recover J8.]
;B[gq];W[hp]LB[ho:A]C[buckyyowza: another 1 point sente that weakens white's shape by 1 liberty. H5 is bigger.]
;B[hq];W[eq]C[buckyyowza: better to tenuki now. E3 leaves white's shape in a state where something will need to be sacrificed if black plays at all in this area.]

(;B[er];W[ko]LB[oh:C][in:B][ln:A][fp:D]C[buckyyowza: this pushes black into attacking two of white's groups.  should be M6 or J6 to protect one of them.  P12 is still more interesting than this area. Better yet, F4 protects against the big weakness left in the stones there.]
;B[jo];W[jn]LB[in:A]C[buckyyowza: white misreads too much here, and drops almost 20 points in this area.  Should be J6.]

[dm][em][dn][en][nn]C[buckyyowza: White has little chance of winning now.  L18 is arguably one of the biggest plays on the board, worth about 4 points in sente.  Lets see what else is on the board:

white has 2 captured stones, 35 points in solid territory in the upper left, about 4 around E6, 3 more from the big dragon, and 6.5 komi = 50.5 points

black has 4 captured stones, 42 points in solid territory in the upper right, 8 in the lower right, 22 in the lower left, and about 4 more in aji = 80 points

So, the score is down to 29.5 points and the biggest plays on the board are worth 4 in sente.  At best, white will be able to recover perhaps another 10 ten points, but black still wins.  Of course, there is always the chance that black will misread the lower right ;-)]

[hs][is][rs][ss]C[buckyyowza:  Well, this has been quite a game!  Thanks for a chance to look this over. In general, white's opening in this game is too slow and therefore he finds a difficult time getting enough points to win.  Then, later he gets a lucky break and nearly wins, but loses his chance by leaving too much weakness behind in yose.  It seems that your middle game strategy and 'whole-board thinking' are not too bad, it is tactics that lose the game for white this time.

I hope my comments have been of use ;-)  Please feel free to contact me via email or look for 'bucky' on KGS if you have any further questions.]
