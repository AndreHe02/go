C[JS: Dear Wasiqi, my name is Jürgen Suntinger and I am hoping to help you in understanding the basics of this wonderful game. 

As you have already mentioned you are a bit overranked becaus the few games you've played on KGS where all against stronger players around 14 kyu. I advise you to also play agains weaker players around 20 kyu and you will enjoy some winnings.

My comments always begin with my Initials JS throughout the game.

Good luck for you Go carreer!];B[pp]C[anberka2 [14k\]: hi];W[cc]
C[Wasiqi [15k?\]: Hello];B[oj]LB[pc:B][pd:A]C[JS: This is a very strange move. Generally playes in the opening are on the 3rd or 4th line to secure terretory. A generally principle is to first occupy the corners, then the sides and at least the center. This is becaus it is easier to make terretory in the corners than on the side., or even in the center. So a play around A or B would better.]
;W[pd];B[jp]LB[pp:A]C[JS: Here too, your opponent will take the 3rd corner after your side extension and your 3 stones are still easy to invade.

In the given variation I just show you how easy it is for your opponent to invade you Hoshi (4-4) Stone at A.]

(;W[dp];B[pf];W[mc];B[jj]C[JS: Going to make terretory in the center is generall no good idea, because it can be reduced alot.]
;W[ci];B[ih]LB[dd:B][fq:A]C[Is this over extending?

JS: This move is not really attacking your opponent, and does not give you soo much terretory becaus your opponent can still invade your growing moyo.

Attacking at A or reducing at B would be better coices.];W[qn]

(;B[mg]C[JS: You are still enlarging your moyo, although your opponent invaded it. Now he will have no worries about living in what you have staked out for your own. See my variation for a better usage of your stones to attak the invasion.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[ro];W[qo]

(;B[sp];W[pr];B[ps];W[rr];B[rs];W[qs]LB[se:A]C[JS: This situation is actually Ko. Note that you cannot capture back immediatly because this would be against to rules. So you have to find a Ko Thread. This should be a move which threatens to gain more than the value of the Ko which the opponent has just captured.

See the variation starting with]

;B[kf];W[cl];B[fm];W[fo];B[gi];W[cj]C[JS: Now, one can actually see, that your opponent has taken all the side terretory, while you got the center more or less. It is still very insecure and hard to defend. At a first glance this center looks very big, but it is very dangerous to estimate such a terretory without counting it correctly. It is much smaller than it looks. And when you look at the number of stones you have invested in getting it,  this terretory looks even smaller. 

If you look at whites upper left side he uses 4 stones to secure a lot of side terretory, whereas you have used 3 times as much stones to build half the wall of your center terretory. Just think about it :-)

Here my comment ends.

;W[pn];B[np];W[qk]LB[pj:A]TR[oj]C[JS: This is a standard variation, but now the marked stone should have been on the 4th line at A.

What you want to do in a situation like this when your opponent invades a big terretory is to not let him have two eyes to live, so that he has to run out. When he does so you are getting terretory on the side of the road to victory, or even kill him because he is not able to escape.]
