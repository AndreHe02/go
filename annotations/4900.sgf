AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I'm Kim (aka phantom).  I'll be reviewing this game for black (adamkrajew).

To best view this review, follow the main path and move to the variations only when instructed to do so.  Be sure to check the last move for my final comments.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email (gophantom@gmail.com) or look for me on KGS where I play as phantom.]

(;B[cf]LB[cf:A][cg:B]C[There are times when solid moves like A are best, but this is one of them.  In this situation, protecting at B would be better.  (See variation.)]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd]C[What are you trying to do at this point?

It seems as though you are trying to confine white to the corner as much as possible.  But, as white shows with the next move, he can just keep pushing out.

Since there's nothing to be gained by trying to block white in, this is a good time to consider playing somewhere else.]

(;B[eo]LB[dn:B][eo:A]C[Pushing on white's stone here just gives him an excuse to build a strong wall.  A better follow up move would be to just take the side. (See variation.)]
;W[en];B[dn];W[ep];B[do];W[em]
(;B[dm]LB[cl:B][dm:A]TR[dl]C[When both players are building walls next to each other like this, pay attention to who is ahead.  In this case, white is a move ahead.  This lets him play moves like his next one (a hane at D8).  The player who is ahead, is often going to get more out of the exchange.  So, you want that player to be you.  Playing at B instead of A here would have helped you pull ahead.  (See variation.)]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[di];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk]C[Letting white split like this, hurts a lot.  Black's corner group is closed in completely, and white can threaten black's other group a bit now.]
;B[ak]C[This is a bit of a wasted move.  It doesn't help your group, and it only expands your territory by a couple of points.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[hg]LB[hc:B][hg:A]
C[Take a look at what each player gets by building a wall here.  Especially, if white continues to push one move more...  (See variation.)

If you really want to develop that group, consider a move at B instead.  Things have changed a little since the last time we looked at this part of the board.  Notice that if you play there now, you really can block white in.  Furthermore,  you'll be developing your group in a useful direction.]

(;W[oq];B[pq];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[nm]C[This time you're ahead in the wall building, which is very nice.  But, you still need to be careful.  First of all, keep an eye on how far you are from the side of the board.  If you leave too much space there and too many cutting points, there is a good chance white will be able to invade.

Also look at what white is building.  He can use his two walls together, like you can use your wall and the side of the board, to make a space that is very hard to invade.  If that space gets too big and too difficult to invade, you could have problems.

Right now, both players look pretty vulnerable to invasion.  So, it's hard to say who is crazier to be building these walls.  But, one simple solution might be to back off a bit and stake out some tough to invade territory on the side and leave the other player to worry about cutting points in invasions.]
;W[mm];B[ml]C[Both players are just asking to be cut by playing like this and leaving so many cutting points.  I'm surprised neither is adventurous enough to try anything exciting yet not frightened enough to just defend a little...]
;W[qe]C[When white tenukis here, I'd think about going back and taking advantage of some of the cuts he left asap, if not immediately.  (See variations.)]

(;B[nf]LB[me:B]TR[oe][pe][qe][of][pf]C[Have you learned about empty triangles before?

This is a notoriously bad shape that double digit kyus seem to love to make.  Both players have made one now.  As black will show in a couple of moves, white gets into a lot of trouble with his.

But, the trouble with empty triangles isn't limited to situations where they end up getting killed.  They're usually bad because they are really inefficient.  Usually, when someone plays an empty triangle, he has missed a better move.

In this case, black's best move would probably be to just capture white's stones.  But, let's pretend that's not an option and that black and white are just trying to decide the borders.  Think about what would happen if black played B.  (See variation.)]

(;B[qi]LB[qi:A][lk:B]C[Black doesn't really need this move.  Things could get very complicated if he doesn't play it and still wants to kill R11.  But, there are certainly bigger moves on the board, like B.  (See variation.)]
;W[lk];B[ol];W[hc];B[hd]LB[kd:B]TR[gd][ge]C[This is another empty triangle.  However, at this point, even the most efficient shapes in this area won't accomplish much.

Instead consider making something out of the top by playing B.]

(;B[bq];W[cq];B[tt];W[tt]C[Overall, this was a pretty close game until the little blunder at the end.  The main problem was in letting white develop such large center territory, despite his weaknesses and cutting points.

For future games, I suggest keeping a careful eye on weaknesses that you and your opponents leave in the borders between your groups, and fixing yours while exploiting your opponents'.  I also suggest trying to watch what your oppoent is getting out of your exchanges.  If he's getting a big wall that you don't want to deal with, don't give it to him, play elsewhere.

Best of luck in your go studies and in all your games!])

(;B[bp]C[Sometimes you have to finish a ladder this way.];W[ao]
;B[ap]C[As long as white stays in atari, you can break the usual zig zag of the ladder and still capture.

It's pretty common for opponents to find cutting points to exploit at the end of the game around your level, and it's easy to get lazy when reading out how to defend.  But, after getting burned by it enough times, you learn to be more careful.]

This is a good point to explore whether or not white can do much damage with R10.  (See first variation.)

If white decides R10 doesn't work, he can always just play Q11 and let black worry about fixing.  (See second variation.)

In any case, the point is that the capture of R11 earlier would only earn a few points for black, but moving into the center would deprive white of many more.]
