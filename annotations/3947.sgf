C[`` Hello, I'll be reviewing this game for black.

I begin all of my comments with `` to make them easy to spot.  I try to define all go terms I use when I introduce them, but if you run into any you want better definitions for, I suggest searching Sensei's Library (http://senseis.xmp.net/).]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[pd];W[dp];B[df]LB[jd:A][op:B]C[`` When you play your opening moves on the star points, moves like this to strengthen the corner are not useful.

If you have a stone on a 3-4 like D17, then a nearby stone somewhere like C15 or D15 will give you a nice strong corner enclosure.  (See variation)

But, stones on 4-4 points are better for gaining influence than territory.  Even when you add another stone like you did here, your corner is still open to invasion.  So, it's better to accept the fact that your first stone can do its job all by itself and look for bigger moves elsewhere on the board.

A better option here would be to either build more influence over the entire top of the board with a move at A or try approaching white's corner with something around B.]

(;W[jd]LB[lc:A]C[How to attack it?

`` You chose to attack with A.  That was the best side to approach from because the left side of the board is stronger than the right for you right now.  So, with a move around A you can get stronger on the right while pushing white towards your strength on the left.

Keep in mind, that K16 has a lot of room to move, so when you attack, you won't be able to kill it.  Remember that you do not need to respond to every move your opponent makes.  At this point, you could also ignore that stone and tenuki (play elsewhere).]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[ld];W[gc]
(;B[ge]C[ok?

`` This sequence went well for you right up to this last move.

I would definitely tenuki after white's G17.  Your move (G15) does not really threaten to hurt the white group, so white will be able to ignore it and move on.  You want to be the one who gets to move on first!

If you spend the entire opening following your opponent’s around the board and only moving on when they do, you'll find that they always seem to come out of the opening with a better position than you.  So, you should always keep your eyes open for opportunities to be the first to move on.

At this point R4 looks like a nice target.  Approaching it at P3 or P4 would be something white would have to respond to. (See variation)

Notice that when white gets there first, it really limits your options.  There's a proverb that states "your opponent's best move is your best move."  This situation is a good illustration of that proverb.]
;W[oq];B[pj]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[`` Playing on this side of the board is a good idea right now.  White would really like to extend in this direction because his corner enclosure on the bottom right points upward.  So, denying him the opportunity to play here is great for you.

It might have been better to play B instead of A though.  Up until this point, most of your moves have been on the fourth line rather than the third line.  Just like moves on the 4-4 point go for influence while moves on the 3-4 point can make territory, moves on the fourth line will give you influence and moves on the third give you territory.  Since influence and territory are both important, it's generally a good idea to look for a balance between the two types of moves.

Another reason it is good a stone on the third line will be clearer after white's next move...]
;W[ql]C[`` Because you played on the fourth line, white can threaten to sneak in under your stone by playing here.  So, you have to defend.  If your stone was on the third line, white wouldn’t be able to threaten.  (See variation)]

(;B[rk]C[ok?

`` Yes, this is fine.];W[qk];B[qj];W[rl]C[`` It's possible to ignore moves like this early in the game if you really want to move on.  (See variation for what would happen if white gets the next move here.)]

(;B[rj];W[fp];B[ol]C[wanted to trafer influence to the bottom and threaten an attack on th r8 group...

`` That would be a good idea, but you run into two problems when you try to use this move to do it.

First of all, your move doesn't do much to actually threaten the R8 group, so white can chose to ignore it.  When you intend to use a move as a threat, try to read out what you'll be able to do if your opponent ignores you.  If you can't see yourself getting a lot out of it, your opponent is likely to decide that he can ignore your threat.

Second, it is too far to have much of an impact on the bottom of the board.

If you want to establish something for yourself on the bottom of the board, it would be better to just jump right in.  There's enough space there for you to easily establish a living group.  You don't want to give white more chances to make it harder for you to establish something down there.]
;W[dj];B[ci]C[`` A diagonal approach like this (a shoulder hit) is a bad idea in this situation.  You give white an excuse to make his loan stone at D10 stronger.

Use shoulder hits to reduce large territories, but don't use them on lonely stones.  Attack lonely stones at a distance so you don't give them excuses to call on friends.

(See variation for other possible moves.)]
(;W[cj];B[di]C[`` This move is also just asking for trouble.  There's a proverb that says: "always hane at the head of two stones."  This is good advice because it usually gives you very good shape.  With this move, you create two stones for white to hane at the head of, which is exactly what he does.  Try to avoid moves that give your an opponent a reason to make such good shape.

In future games, try reading just a move or two ahead to figure out whether your moves will help you or your opponent more.  Ask yourself, "If I was him how would I respond?"  Then ask yourself, "Does the board look better for him or me now?"]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[fh]C[now?

`` This is another situation where it helps to try to read ahead a bit.  In the game, you saw what happens if you try to attack white's weakness.  So, it seems like the best thing to do is just play something safe like E13.  (See variation.)]

(;B[fi];W[ej];B[fg];W[dh];B[ch];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[gg];W[hi]

(;B[mp]C[`` Here you move on a little too soon. (See variation.)]
;W[jq];B[oo];W[om]C[is it possible / necessary to connect / to fight ?

`` This is a tricky situation to read out.  Staying connected is a good goal because if you can stay connected, you won't have anything to worry about.

You handle the situation pretty well.  There's just one place where I think you should have played differently.  I'll point it out when we get there.]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[pm];W[ok];B[on]C[`` This is where I would have played differently. (See variation)]

(;W[pk];B[pl];W[ef];B[ee];W[fe];B[fd];W[ff]
(;B[gf]C[`` Rather than connecting here, it would be better to connect at G16.  (See variation.)]
;W[gd];B[jf];W[if];B[ig];W[ie];B[hg];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[ii]
;W[li]LB[ik:A][ml:B]C[where should I pay my attention to now?

`` Ideally, it would be best to find a way to connect the J11 and O7 groups.  They are both a little weak, so connecting them would solve a lot of problems.

The J11 group seems the weaker of the two, so you should run with it.  I might start with a move like A.

If you'd rather start with the lower group, B is a good move.]
;B[nk];W[lk]C[`` Capturing here is pretty big.]
(;B[oj];W[ml];B[nj];W[rn];B[gi]C[`` Try to think of keeping this group as a whole alive rather than keeping the individual stones all connected.  It's not possible to connect F11, so just leave it as something you can threaten with and concentrate on saving the whole group.]
;W[gh];B[hj];W[hh];B[ih];W[kh];B[ij];W[jl];B[hl];W[in]C[`` At this point, you're running out of eye space for your group.  So, this is a good time to sit back and reevaluate the situation.

First try to find a way to make that group live.  If nothing seems to work, look for other places to play.  By continuing to struggle with a group that is pretty much dead, you're just making your opponent stronger, which weakens your other groups like the N5 group and limits you invasion options.

This would be a good time to concentrate on the N5 group at bit.  By fighting with it, you should be able to make it bigger and stronger.]
;B[gn];W[fl];B[gm];W[gk];B[hk];W[qn]
(;B[pn]C[`` Rather than making protective moves like this, make pushing moves like M8 to expand your potential eyespace.]

;W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[lp];W[mr];B[lr];W[nq];B[jr]C[how could I have made both groups live? ^^*

`` From what I can see, at this point, there's no way to do it.  (See my previous advice and variation for suggestions.)]

;W[lf];B[mf];W[co];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[ap];B[ao]C[`` At this point, it would be better to concentrate on making your corner group live.  Your big group in the middle doesn't even have one eye yet, so you can't really make it live.  But, you've used it nicely as a threat so far.  So, it would be best to continue to use it as a threat and try to make a group in the corner.]

Could you enumerate and show my general mistakes, please? Do you have any other comments or general adives how to play? What are my weaknesses?

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

`` There are two things you can work on that will really help your game.  The first is your reading ability.  In your games, practice predicting what your opponent will do and reading out sequences.  Also, try solving some go problems; they can really help your reading ability.

The other thing to work on is learning to control the flow of the game.  Only respond to your opponent’s moves when you have to, and look for moves that you can use to make your opponent respond to you.

I play on KGS and DGS as phantom if you ever want a game.

Good luck in your go progress and in all your future games!

First look at A.  It is a good place to invade the bottom because it has a lot of room to move and get life no matter how white attacks.  Since you have nothing urgent to take care of, invading would be a good idea right now.

B and C are also interesting possibilities.  Making a move at B would force white to protect against a move like C which could cut off D10.  After white protects, you'll be able to play A.

If you play C immediately, white won't have a chance to defend, and you should end up with something good.  But, you make not be the first one to play around A, which is important.]
