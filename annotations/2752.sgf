C[Balanzu [15k\]: hi

RickMott: Hi, a while later... :)

Overall, I think your play was quite good.
You missed a few big moves, and if you are
looking for the quickest and easiest way to
improve your winning percentage, concentrate
on sente in the endgame.  I've been working
on the fifth Janice Kim book; that is her
suggestion, and I think it would help you
a lot.  There are some local tactical things
you missed, but in general I would focus on
making sure you look for big sente opportunities
throughout the game.  Every time, before you
respond locally, make sure you really need to.
Giving up a few points to get 10 or 15 elsewhere
is a good trade.  Good luck!];B[pp]C[Senna [15k\]: hi
Senna [15k\]: good game];W[pd];B[cp]C[Balanzu [15k\]: you too]
;W[dd];B[qf];W[qh];B[of]TR[nd][qj]C[Balanzu [15k\]: At this point, I am not sure where I should put my next stone. I was thinking to put at O16 or R10.

RickMott: Joseki isn't the strongest part of my game, but it is unusual for Black to jump out
right away.  Most players will respond to a pincer by playing on the 3-3 point.

I think O16 is best, and if you're going to extend from the other stone you should go to
R9 (2-space extension), not R10.];W[nd]C[RickMott: I think this is good.  If Black tries to pincer you, his stones aren't really
strong enough to support a severe attack on your R12 stone.]
;B[pi]
(;W[qj]C[RickMott: Don't jump here; you're just inviting Black to push and cut.
Consider pushing and cutting yourself (see variation).];B[qi]
;W[ri];B[pg];W[ph]C[RickMott: Good!  You want to separate white.]
;B[pj];W[qk]C[RickMott: I wouldn't do this.  I would push up at P17 to separate black's stones
and attack the upper group.  You can live on the right side, but Black becomes
strong on the outside and harder to attack.];B[oh];W[rg]C[RickMott: This move is too small.  Saving the 2 stones is only 4 points,
and they aren't important cutting stones anymore.  Maybe R6, which
combines a nice extension with a corner approach, would be better.]
;B[qg]C[RickMott: Bad shape and overconcentration for Black.  If you let him capture,
he's invested 9 stones to get 6 points!  Play elsewhere.];W[rh]
;B[ni]TR[pi][qi][pj]C[Balanzu [15k\]: Do you think I should try to capture the black stones or play somewhere else?

RickMott:  How  would you capture the stones?  They're connected to a big group.
Definitely play elsewhere.  S15, for example; it defends your corner and connects
your groups.  If you don't like that, try K16 or L17.  In any event, you want to help your
two stones which are now near black thickness.  You don't want Black to play a 3rd
line approach on the upper side and still have the option of invading at 3-3.]
;W[cn]C[RickMott: Approaching an unbalanced corner is good in general, but (a) helping
your two stones in the upper right is more urgent, and (b) you should approach 
from the other side.  Letting Black jump to E5 is too easy for him.]
;B[eq]C[RickMott: Not the best response for Black.  He should play E4, which
both takes a bigger corner and puts more pressure on your stone.]
;W[ck]C[RickMott: Ok position for you.];B[cf];W[ch]C[RickMott: Good!  This is what I would do.  You force Black to live small in the corner
and build outside strength from which you will complete the upper-side moyo.]
;B[ef]C[RickMott: Once again, Black jumps out.  Just extend along the 4th line at the top.]
;W[fd]C[RickMott: You're not going to be 15k for long... :)]
;B[eh];W[dg]C[RickMott: This is not the urgent area of the board.  You should be looking at
the top center, or making the upper left corner solid.   Starting a fight here
doesn't serve your purposes.  A contact play at C15 or a play around K17 or
K18 would be better.];B[gf]C[RickMott: But you're lucky, and Black makes a poor response.]
;W[df]C[RickMott: Yes, now push and cut makes sense.];B[hd]
;W[jc]C[RickMott: Right idea, but I might play at L17 instead to make a stronger link
with the upper right stones.  You are way ahead now, with a huge left side
and upper left corner.  Stay strong and plan on reducing black's territory
from the outside, and you should have an easy game from here.  This move
leaves Black some ways to fight in the upper right.];B[me];W[md]
C[RickMott: But he forces you to fix up your weak linkage.  Did you
thank him properly?  :)];B[ke];W[ld]C[RickMott: I'd play L16 instead.  Then you can poke in on either side
by making a tiger's mouth, and if Black tries to push in at M16 you
atari while making a tiger's mouth connection.];B[hc];W[eg]
C[RickMott: This is a small move.  Why not just protect your big corner
instead?  Something like G18.];B[fg]C[RickMott: But black responds, so it must have been psychological
sente.  However, you've forced him to fix up his weakness, and you
got no points and no threats, which is not a good exchange for you.]
;W[ge]C[RickMott: Again, all you're doing here is forcing Black to patch up his
position for no gain.  This is better left unplayed.  It might have been
interesting if you hadn't played E13 previously; then you could have
pushed at F14 to create some cutting points.];B[he];W[fe]C[RickMott: Bad shape, and a very small move.  Black should ignore
this and play elsewhere.  There are plenty of big moves: bottom center,
for example.];B[gh];W[ff]C[RickMott: 2-point move.  Surely there are 10 or 15 point moves around!
Look to the bottom center, lower right corner, upper left corner  -- all much
more important than capturing one stone.];B[cc]C[RickMott: Oh, right, I forgot this one, too.  This is worth maybe
20 points.  I don't think you can stop it, because black can
threaten to live directly in the corner or connect out to the
H line of stones.  You have to protect as much of your territory
as you can, while ensuring that the sequence ends in sente
for you.];W[cd]C[RickMott: Blocking on this side is correct.  You want to preserve
as much territory as you can, if you can't kill.];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb]
(;W[fb]C[RickMott: I considered a few variations on this, but it's not bad
and it does end in sente.  Because of the potential cutting point
at H14, it's probably good to keep the corner separated from
the H line of stones.  I'll tell you why in a few moves.];B[bd]
;W[be];B[bb];W[db];B[cb];W[ea];B[ad]TR[bb][cb][cc][dc][bd]C[Balanzu [15k\]: At this point, I am not sure how to capture all the black stones. I think I made wrong moves a few steps ago.
Balanzu [15k\]: Actually I had intention to play at A15 or A18. Is it better if I play there? or is there any other better move?

RickMott: I don't think you could capture the 3-3 invasion.  This is not bad;
you confine Black to a small corner and you get sente.];W[ca]
C[RickMott: This is a forcing move, but you should save it for
a ko threat.];B[ba];W[ac]C[Balanzu [15k\]: Do you think I should defend at D19, instead of attacking at A17?

RickMott: It depends on whether your opponent answers correctly or not.
You should assume a correct response, and leave A17 unplayed as a ko
threat.];B[da]C[RIckMott: But this is a bad move by Black.]
;W[eb]C[RickMott: This is wrong.  You should play A18 and let Black take
the ko at E18.  If you win that ko, the corner dies!  You should get
a big benefit somewhere else.];B[ab]C[RickMott: Now Black is unconditionally alive.  This is a big lost opportunity
for you.];W[ae]C[RickMott: bad move.  This looks like sente, but it isn't because
you have to defend the cut at C15 after Black captures at B17.]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[qd]C[RickMott: so Black takes one of many huge points.]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[qe]C[RickMott: I think S17 immediately would be better.]
;B[pe];W[oe];B[re];W[rc]C[RickMott:  The cut at Q17 probably kills your corner.  See variation.]

(;B[ne];W[od];B[ib]
(;W[jb]C[RickMott: Don't defend here.  You can break into Black's moyo, and the cut at H14
is still there.  Start with M15.  See variation.];B[kd];W[kc]
;B[ol]C[Balanzu [15k\]: At this time, I was confused, whether to make a move at R6, or try to attack  black's lower part.

RickMott: I think R6 is good.  Otherwise Black will get a huge lower right corner
while attacking your stones.];W[nq];B[qn];W[rm];B[qm];W[ql]
;B[lq];W[jq]C[RickMott: This is not good.  You're going to create two weak groups.  Jump into 3-3 instead
in response to a tight pincer.];B[lo]TR[ol][qm][qn][pp][lq]
C[Balanzu [15k\]: At this point, I was thinking to extend my stone to O5, but I was afraid that it will be useless, since I was surrounded by black's stones.
Balanzu [15k\]: So, I try to connect my two white stones at M2 instead. But now that I think back to it, I think it was a bad move.

I think a slide to Q2 might be good.  Your outside stone can still run into the center
or make a base at G3.];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[mq];W[nr];B[ms]TR[jq]
[kr][lr]SQ[nq][nr]C[Balanzu [15k\]: My two groups of white stones are completely separated now. M2 indeed is a bad move  :(
Balanzu [15k\]: Next, I try to extend to the lower right corner. But in the end, I can't manage to make two eyes.

RickMott: That's because you should jump to 3-3.  Then you can live easily.]

(;W[pq];B[qq];W[qp]C[RickMott: OK, crosscut is a good defensive idea.]
;B[rp];W[qr];B[qo];W[rq];B[qp]
(;W[oq]C[Balanzu [15k\]: Do you think I will do better if I put my stone at S2, instead of P3? or both moves are useless?

RickMott; I think you live with S2 (see variations), but it may not be worthwhile. 
You have 2 weak groups to worry about.  Giving up the corner and making
your bottom center group live with G3 is worth considering.]
;B[rr];W[rs]C[RickMott:  Once Black cuts here, you can't make two eyes inside.  You should
probably  play elsewhere (like the G3 extension).];B[sr];W[ps]
;B[ns];W[os];B[np];W[op];B[oo]C[RickMott: All of these plays inside are just forcing Black to strengthen his
position, and removing any ko threats you may have.];W[mp];B[no]
;W[kq]C[RickMott: OK, that was a good forcing exchange.];B[lp]
;W[gq]C[RickMott: Good!   But it would have been better if you had just played G3
a long time ago and left the forcing moves as aji.];B[io];W[eo]
C[RickMott: This move tries to do too much.  You can't seal Black into the
corner (he can come out at F4).  It doesn't help your bottom group for
the same reason, and it doesn't do much to restrict Black's moyo.

I think either a play to ensure life for the bottom, like E2 or F2, is
better.  Then a deep jump, say G7, to reduce Black's center moyo
and enlarge your left side.];B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[ep]
(;B[dq]C[RickMott: This is a mistake by Black.  He should play H3, sacrifice the corner,
and kill your bottom-center group in sente.  Then complete his giant center
moyo with G8, and it's a very difficult game for you.  See variation.]
;W[hp]C[RickMott: This sequence turns out well for you, but it shouldn't have.]
;B[go]C[RickMott: Another bad choice by Black.  He should give up the two
stones; they aren't critical.  He should play H5 in sente, then complete
the center moyo.];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn];B[gm];W[fo];B[gk]C[Balanzu [15k\]: I totally forget about the center part, until black attack at G9. But I guess its too late now  :(

RIckMott: Not at all.  Black's wall is not strong.  There are two major weak points: the cut at J6, and
the push/cut sequence at M15.];W[le]C[RickMott: Ok, this is fine, you should end in sente and get the other one too.]
;B[lf];W[in];B[hm];W[jo];B[jn];W[im];B[ip];W[jp];B[jk]C[RickMott: Ok, good sequence, you got them both and ended in sente.  Very good!]
;W[jm];B[km]C[RickMott: Be careful; if you fool around here too much and end in gote (forced to take
the 2 black stones to connect), and Black gets to connect the crucial cutting point at
L14, that would be very bad.];W[kn];B[kl];W[fm]C[RickMott: Not big enough.  Black should connect at L14.]
;B[fl];W[ik];B[hl];W[il];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj]C[RickMott: Actually, this is a good sacrifice.  Black gives up 8 points in exchange for a
big reduction of your left-side potential];W[gl];B[fj];W[el]
;B[ln];W[ej]C[RickMott:  The cut at L14 is MUCH bigger.  This is 4-5 points in gote.]
;B[ei];W[ek];B[fk];W[di];B[bn];W[bo];B[bm]TR[cp][dq][eq]C[Balanzu [15k\]: I try to find a way to capture black's three marked stones, but I can't figure out any ways to capture them. Is it possible to capture them?

RickMott:  I think you should be certain you capture the two stones that are
invading your territory first.];W[co]C[RickMott: This connect is crucial.]
;B[bp];W[es]C[Balanzu [15k\]: Is there any better moves to push black further to the corner?

RickMott: Your best chance to kill is probably the 2-2 point.  If Black is going
to make eyes, it will be in the corner.  You want to fill his eye space with a
dead shape.  Since the 2-2 would be an excellent point for Black to try to
live, you should take it first.];B[dr]C[Balanzu [15k\]: This is near the end of the game
Balanzu [15k\]: So I have no more comment further on.

RickMott: This is a terrible response by Black.  Now
if you take the 2-2, you should kill him.]

;W[dm];B[cl];W[bk];B[an];W[dl];B[ap];W[je]C[RickMott:  Too bad.  The cut at L14 is much better.  You threaten the double atari at N14,

been enough to win.  He should push at T17 before connecting.  That would be worth 2
points.];W[sc];B[lb];W[mb];B[ls];W[ks]C[RickMott: A response here is only 1 point.  There are sente moves left;
