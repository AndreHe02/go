C[I guess I've made 4 mistakes.
If there were any other mistakes, or if there were better ways to attack, tell me please.


This game has many small errors intechnique or shape that I will point out, and a few strategic mistakes as well.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[qf]C[An immediate approach like this is unusual, but playable.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[pp];B[nq];W[jq]
(;B[kq]C[Usually attaching to a stone like this is an emergency measure when your own group is weak and needs help.  Since the white pincer is very wide, the black stone is not is much danger, so this attachment is not necessary.

When you attach to an enemy stone it ends up stronger.  If you don't attach, this stone will be weaker and easier to attack later.]
;W[jp];B[kr];W[fq]C[Good extension]
(;B[pq]C[Again this attachment is not good, since it will strengthen white. Black is much stronger now, so should attack with a pincer.]

(;W[dp]C[Again, this attachment is wrong since it will strengthen the black stone.  White is already stronger here, so you don't want to help black.

Remember to use attachments for defense, and one point jumps ot knight's moves for attack.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[cq];W[co];B[eq]
(;W[ep]C[A small technique:  This move makes an empty triangle, and gives black more room on the edge.  It's better to play one move to the right.  Emty triangles (at E5) are bad since they are inefficient.]
;B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[de];B[cb];W[fd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[qj]
;B[qp];W[qm];B[po];W[qe]C[Good attack.  In this case attaching to attack is OK, since your attaching stone is supported by the stone at Q16, so black doesn't get stronger, just heavier.]
;B[pf];W[nd];B[lc]C[Leaving the two black stones (at R14) undefended is dangerous. White should be able to attack them now, and
gain something while chasing them.];W[ic];B[nb];W[ob];B[nc]
;W[oc];B[md];W[ne]C[Good for white.  The two black stones are now much weaker since there is a very strong white group nearby.]
;B[jb];W[jc];B[ib];W[lf];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd];B[fc]C[White has built up wonderful outside walls, while giving black secure territory.  But it is difficult to surround territory in the center unless you do it while attacking.  At this point I would play a move to attack the two stones in the upper right, and possibly capture them.]

(;W[op];B[qn]
(;W[oo]C[You missed a chance to cut black here.];B[oq];W[pn]
;B[qo];W[pm]C[Still, this outside thickness is a good result.]
;B[ri];W[qi];B[rh]
(;W[rj]C[I would play this move in the center instead.  You should attack strongly, but do it in a way that even if black lives, you get sente and a good result.  Continuing to surround the center would be good.]
;B[qh];W[rf]C[Again I would play in the center.  If you chase the black group out into the center, and it ends up living, you will give up a lot of your potential territory.  Better to force him to live on the edge and take a huge center territory in compensation.]
;B[rg];W[re];B[oh];W[og];B[pg];W[ng];B[pi]
(;W[oi]C[This move is too close, and helps black get stronger.  The point at Q12 is already a false eye since you have stones at P13 and R11, so there is no need to play here to stop the eye.

The shape attack is at O11, surrounding, and preventing an eye at P11.  Black might die then, and even if it doesn't you will get a nice outside position.]

(;B[oj]C[This is the wrong side, and helps white surround black.  Black needs access to the center to run away.]
;W[ni];B[pj];W[nj]
(;B[pk]C[Making an empty triangle is usually wrong.  You should look for something better.]
;W[qk];B[sj];W[ql];B[ol];W[nn];B[om];W[on]
(;B[nk]C[Again black needs to get out into the center.  If white chases you though the center it is very good for black, since it destroys white's potential territory there.]
;W[pl]C[This move is very bad.  You are too focussed on killing this eye.  Black can easily run away.  And it fills in one of your own liberties.  Since white doesn't have eyes yet there is always the possibility of a semeai later, so this is a liberty you might need.]

(;B[nm]C[Again black should run into the center rather than just trying to make eyes.]
;W[mm]C[Again it is too close to black, and doesn't prevent the second eye.]
;B[ml]
(;W[lm]LB[mk:a]C[Should I play w92 at 'a'?
Is this possible to kill the blacks?

This is the first mistake I've made, I guess.];B[mj]C[Now black is alive, and did not get surrounded.  White would be much better if there was a white wall around this group after it lived.]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[lk];B[mk]
(;W[ll]C[I would use this move to more completely surround black.]

(;B[cg]C[Black must invade.  This move is a little too close to the white wall though.  I would play lower, to allow extensions in both directions.]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[bh];W[cj];B[cf];W[ce]
(;B[eh]C[The knight move is a little dangerous since it can be cut.]

(;W[ch]C[This move is not very effective since it forces black to connect.]
;B[dg];W[fg]C[Good.  Surround, and at the shape point.];B[ef]
;W[ed];B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[fj]C[Good.  Attack while surrounding trerritory.]
;B[hj]C[Another dangerous knight's move.  When the opponent tis strong so none of the local ladders work, it can be cut.]

(;W[hg];B[gl]
(;W[el]C[You could try another cut instead of this move.  When you are strong, cut.]
;B[fo]C[I wouldn't worry too much about this peep since white is so strong. Another chance to cut black instead.]

(;W[fp]C[White is letting this weak black group push him around.  White should be attacking here, not black, since white has surroundig thickness.]
;B[em];W[fl];B[fm]
(;W[gm]C[Good.  A cut.  Unfortunately it lets black build a nice wall. Still, it captures the group above and should win the game.]
;B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[in];W[jm];B[dl]
(;W[gk]C[This move is very safe and gives you a winning position.  I would be more agressive (see variation), but that way is also much riskier.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[ej];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[cm];W[ei];B[bk];W[aj]
;B[bo]C[Now the lower black group is safe, and the white stones below are weak.  If you save the lower white stones, you win.]
;W[dn]C[The black group is already alive since it's connected to the corner, so this move doesn't gain anything.  Save it for a ko threat.]
;B[dm];W[gr];B[er];W[jn];B[kp]
(;W[ki]C[This move has to defend the bottom, since black can cut off your stones.  If you defend the bottom stones, you have an easy win since the upper middle black group will die.]
;B[jo]C[I thought there was enough space to survive while w152. But alas, after b153, the whites are in danger.

Should I play w152 at 153?
After b153, was there any chance for white to survive?

You needed to defend.  I prefer to right of 152 to take a few points.  At this point I don't see how you can survive.  Your group has very little eye shape, and no forcing moves.  BLack is too strong.]
;W[io];B[ko];W[jr];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[ir];B[ho];W[hq];B[io]
;W[hs]C[Since white is already dead, this move can be saved for a ko threat later.]
;B[js]C[With this capture black is way ahead.  White did well in the endgame to make the game close.]
;W[kn];B[bf];W[ae];B[ag];W[ai];B[ah];W[af];B[bg]C[This move doesn't help black live.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[hh];B[hi];W[kd]C[Good.  Since black is adding stones to a dead group, take some points elsewhere.]
;B[ji];W[kj];B[kc];W[jd];B[me];W[mf];B[mi];W[rn]C[Good this is a very big endgame move since it has a good follow up.  Responding in the center is much smaller.]
;B[ro];W[rm];B[lj]C[This move loses points.  Black should play at M12 to reduce the center.]
;W[mh];B[oe];W[od];B[of];W[nf];B[pe];W[so]C[Good.  Black filled a dame, so take some points.]

(;B[qq]C[This move is better one to the right.]
(;W[sp]C[White can jump here.  It's bigger.];B[sr]C[This move is bad.  It can be captured if white fights a ko.]

(;W[sq];B[rr];W[sk];B[mo]LB[lp:b][mp:a]C[What was the best point for white before b203?
203, a, b, or somewhere else?

N4 (a).  Black might even answer, and you would gain about 3 points.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[np];B[mp]
(;W[si]C[A9 is bigger, since it is sente.  You can get it and this move.

In the endgame, always look hard for sente moves before you play a move that doesn't need to be answerd.  Especially a move like this that is only worth one point.]
;B[ak]C[Good.];W[cc];B[bb];W[dc];B[db]
(;W[ld]C[Again, this is one point, and not sente.  Take the sente endgame first.]

(;B[le]C[This is only one point, and not sente.  Take the sente endgame first.]
;W[ke];B[mc];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[lb];W[sg]C[This move costs points.  Black can never make a single point here on the edge, and after he responds you must play a ko to save your stone.  So if white wins the ko, white gives up sente for zero points, and if white loses the ko, black gains a point.

A16 is better.  It gains a point.];B[sh];W[sf];B[qd];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[li];W[lh];B[jj]C[Black gives up a point here.  The game is very close, so black should be taking points, not giving them.]
;W[kh]C[Since black is slightly ahead, I would take A16 and take my chances on keeping black dead.  Ideally this near the end of the game you should have a very good idea of the score.]
;B[ik];W[ih];B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[ii];B[di];W[gi];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[ij];W[df];B[ad]C[So black gets the last point.];W[rq];B[rp]
;W[sn];B[ln];W[tt]LB[sj:a]C[I should play at 'a' before I passed.
This made me lose two more points.

Yes.  But just one more point, for the prisoner.];B[sj];W[qr]
;B[pr];W[si]
(;B[jl]C[Playing at L7 gets one extra ko threat compared to this move.]
;W[km];B[sj];W[rs];B[qs];W[si];B[gj]C[This is not a ko threat, since there is a snapback.  If black captures at F11, white recaptures at G11.  

White should fill the ko now, and will gain a point from the ko, and another fromone more prisoner.]

(;W[fi];B[sj];W[tt];C[Thanks for your review.
All comments are welcome!

Black still needs to fill the ko.  IGS will give black an extra point for the unfilled ko.  White has another ko threat at M19.

Overall, a good game for white except for overlooking the cut at the bottom.]
