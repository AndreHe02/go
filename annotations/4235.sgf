C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game, and lost by more than 20 points.
Unlike other games of mine, I did not make a gross error that caused a large goup of mine to be captured, so my mistakes were probably more strategic. I felt behing right after the opening, so may be the problems starts there.
Any comment is acceptable - a summary of the main points I have to improve will be appreciated.
Thanks, Avi];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq];B[ep]C[I would have played Q5 instead, to work with the star-point stone, but probably this is more a matter of style than what is really better.]
;W[hp];B[en];W[cm]
(;B[el];W[dk];B[kp]C[I think so far is a joseki.

I think if you wanted to pincer you should have build up more strength, and pressed white down to the third line, as in the variation from move 9.  Here, if white and black both run out, white gets 4th line territory on the left side; probably good for white.]
;W[mp]C[I saw more the N3 approach.

This looks aggressive for white,but this is white's side of the board; white has more stones than black here.  Still, it should be a reasonable fight.]
;B[mq]C[Is this the correct response?

I think this helps solidify white, and still doesn't get you eye shape.  Perhaps later you will wish you had attached on top instead.  I do think the idea is right: lean on white's strong group here in order to build an attack on H4.  The idea of strengthening L4 is that then maybe you can play a move like H6 later.]
;W[np];B[lq];W[hn]C[I think this spells trouble: black has two weak groups.]
;B[cq]C[At this point I felt the E4 group needs reinforcement.

This is why you should have strengthened the E4 group before pincering at L4.  Then you could decide whether to play L4 or not, based on how white responds to this C3 move, for example.  Now white is happy to give you the corner if it makes a strong attack on the E4 stones.]
;W[bq];B[dq];W[bo]C[White plays very simply here, staying safe and keeping black weak.]
;B[go]C[This was supposed to protect the E5 defect.

This strengthens white!  The L4 stones look weak now.  If you want to protect E5, do it in a way that makes eyes for your group, like F3.]
;W[ho];B[iq]C[Again strengthening white!  These trades have to be bad for black.  White is going to get a lot of center influence and territory on the left side, and all you get is a tiny territory on the bottom.  You are not using the star point stones!]
;W[hq];B[ir];W[hr];B[fq]C[After I saw next White's move, I regreted this move.

If you had played here without the exchanges at G5, J2, J3, then you could aim at H2 still, so your stones on the right would not be so weak.

Those exchanges, strengthening white, are what caused your problem here.]
;W[kn]C[What to do here? I am sure I did not find the right answer. Or is it too late for a good move?

Black has one group almost sealed in--completely without influence, and just a tiny territory.  Your other big group here is also a little weak.  Meanwhile white's groups are not really attackable.  So this position is already good for white.  Instead of J3/J2, you should have directly played L6 yourself to give some hope of a counterattack against white's stones.]
;B[jn]C[This looks like your best try, but it's not going to work out so well.  Perhaps a simpler, safer move like M5 would be better.  Your only hope is if you can get a good counterattack going against white's H6 stones, but that doesn't look likely right now.]
;W[jm];B[km]C[Perhaps pull back at K5 first, aiming at cutting next at either J7 or L7?  Still, if you K5 and white L8, it's going to get tough for you.]
;W[jo];B[ln];W[ko];B[lo];W[lp];B[jp];W[in]C[Now white's group has almost two eyes, AND you have three weak stones in the center, AND your two bottom groups are tiny, one is sealed in, the other not definitely alive ... this is horrible.  LIke I said earlier, your only hope was a counterattack against the H6 stones, and now that hope is gone and you have gained nothing from it.]
;B[kr]C[White should have to give you two stones of handicap at least to make up for a move like this one!  Now white can simply play some move like Q10, and what will you do?  Or, even worse, white can go on the offensive still with a move like E9.]
;W[kl]C[This is a waste of a move for white; these black stones are already weak, no need to capture them again.  Just play Q10 and black won't be able to do much with these stones anyway.]
;B[lm]C[This is a waste of a move for black; these stones are so weak!  Instead, play Q10 and limit white's influence in this area.]
;W[ll]C[Now I have to save the M6 group...

NO!!!!!  You have to see what you can gain by sacrificing the M6 group.  They are weak stones, and white's groups nearby are going to live anyway.  If saving these stones let you attack on one side or the other, then great, save them.  But there's no attack here.]
;B[nn];W[nl]C[Look at how much influence white gets.  Even if you live with these stones, every move you make here is losing points.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[oo];W[nq];B[nm];W[ol];B[qn];W[ql];B[qp];W[qq]
C[So, count the points: white gets about as much in the corner as you get on the sides, and look at the L8, M8, O8, P8, R8 stones.  Each of those is almost like a free move for white.  So now you should be taking almost a 5-stone handicap to make up for it.

Saving those stones is a game-losing mistake. And it's still not entirely clear that you're going to live!]
;B[rp];W[pp];B[po]C[White is helping you make eye shape here.]
;W[rq];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[pk]C[Look at white's wall now!];B[ro]
C[And gote for you.  Now white could PASS and still win.  Any simple move (K17, R14, C14, whatever) is plenty good for white to have an easy win.]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[nr]C[White shouldn't waste time here; these stones will live anyway.  This is a waste of a ko threat for white.]
;B[jq]C[The 2 groups at the bottom have life, but White has blocked their way to the center and in addition he has sente. I think White leads.

You THINK white leads?  White is at least 5 stones ahead.];W[cf]
C[White can just play simple moves now; the game is over.  Looking at the bottom, white and black have about the same number of points of territory, but the difference in influence is HUGE.]
;B[fd]C[Black can't afford to play simple moves like this: mix things up with a complicated pincer, give white chances to mess up.]
;W[hc]C[White shouldn't take risks like this: if white wanted to invade the top, play K17 in the first place instead of C14, or play L17 now to make O17 and H17 miai.]
;B[jc]C[I felt I cannot let White live easily.

Yes, absolutely make the game complicated!  Still all white has to do is run and link up to the strong H6 stones.]
;W[he];B[je];W[bd]C[White is giving you chances!  Just keep running, H13, and white still has an easy win.  Now you have a chance to attack the H17 stones and maybe catch up.]
;B[cc]C[This seems a little slow.  Jump out at E13 to keep up the attack, or lean at D13, perhaps.]
;W[bc];B[bb]C[This also looks slow: the H17 stones are the important ones, not the points in the corner (though life in the corner would be nice, you're not going to get it anyway.)]
;W[db]C[I think this is a good move for White. I probably should have played C18 instead of B18? The problem is White would easily escape with H13, and extends his lead...

NO, playing C18 is PURE PROFIT for white, so you cannot make a move like that and expect to win games ever.  I can think of very few cases where the right response to pushing in like B17 is to give way like C18.

If you don't like B18, DO NOT play C18.  Instead, what you do is play E13, or G18, or something aiming at attacking the H17 stones.  That is, when white pushes in on one side, don't give in: push out on the other side!

After all, the H17 stones are bigger than the corner.

I like E13, aiming at reducing white's left side, getting out into the center to live, and attacking the H17 stones.  Play there instead of B18 in the first place.  Now it may be too late...]
;B[cb];W[fb];B[ec];W[eb];B[gf]C[Attacking this group is probably your only hope, but it's really too late to expect anything good to come out of this.  The group got a lot stronger with D/E/F18, and your group got a lot weaker.  Perhaps by leaning here you can get a good invasion at C12 later though.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[ch]C[Too deep, I guess? May be D13 better?

No, you are desperately behind, so invading deep and hoping your opponent makes a mistake is probably your best strategy.  D13 makes things simple; white takes the left side and wins.  Perhaps you could have made a few more attacking moves against the J13 group to build up strength first, before invading deeply like this.]
;W[dg];B[ge];W[dh]C[White tries to seal the victory here, but G15 was a real threat...]
;B[ie]C[I think letting Black cut was a mistake, but it did not cost White much. Could I have punished more severely?

White is certainly giving you chances.  This seems like the right way to start the attack.]
;W[hd];B[hf];W[ib]C[Looks like white, with sente, has enough space to live here.]
;B[jb]C[I did not find a way to kil.

If you can get enough points in the upper right to win, maybe it's OK anyway.]
;W[gd];B[hh]C[On F15 I planned to answer with E14.

Any chance of killing if you start with H19 maybe?  Hm, or F17 first?]
;W[fc]C[Looks like white lives now.];B[ee];W[gb]C[Slack, is not it?]
;B[jh]C[I had to capture these important stones, but then...

Why do you have to capture them?  You have half an eye in the corner (play A18 to get one eye), at least half an eye at e16, and what looks like half an eye at F15 too.  So, probably those stones can live even without capturing these two.  So, play R14 and hope to get a huge territory at the top!

Capturing stones like these is VERY important if your stones on either side are weak.  But here your stones on both sides are strong, so there's no use in capturing them.]
;W[qc]C[White invades the corner and from then on basically maintains his lead.

Yes, this is a nice simple move for white.  R14 is probably not as good for white: too overconcentrated with the strong stones at Q9/S9.]
;B[qd]C[Is this the right way to block?  You'll make a wall here, but it'll be facing white's wall, so not so useful.  Blocking the other way will be overconcentrated, though.  This shows the importance of closing the corner instead of K12.]
;W[pc];B[od]C[Why?  This takes away even the few points of territory you could have had in front of your wall.]
;W[nc];B[qj]C[Don't play so close to strong stones.];W[qk];B[rj]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[nd];W[mc];B[oi]C[I think T9 might well be bigger.]
