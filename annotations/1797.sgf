C[A :
I'm Andre. I will do my best in reviewing your game];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[dj]C[Both use san ren sei opening. In my opinion, san ren sei is good to make territory and influence at the same time. It offers great flexibility.

Umezawa Yukari sensei mention some variation at this point (I forgot which episode, I think it's around 12 for simpler answer and around 30 for deeper answer)]

(;B[jd]C[Maybe an approach would be better? I just wanted to try this opening, but it didn't go too good for me

A :
There is a pro's game similar to this played by Cho Chikun. He played the exact sequence so I thought there is nothing wrong with this move. You may approach to threaten to take corner if you like.  Basically when playing this move, you play for influence and not for territory, you have many choices as in variations I made]
;W[jp]C[A :
White choose to play simple too, this game may develop into simple game]
;B[jj]C[A :
This move always occurs at beginner's game, black has advantage by gaining tengen position.]
;W[nq]
(;B[np]C[A :
No touching please, white's not too strong and you're not too weak either. Touching strengthen both side so only touch when you're weak and touch opponent's stronger stone.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[nc]C[A :
Compare this to the variations I made before, will you ? You'ss find a nice treasure there.]
;B[oc]C[A :
No pleaseee, no touching...
White's stone is already weak by K16 and Q 16, touching white will only benefit him]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[ld];B[fc]SQ[hc][ld]C[A :
At this point F16 is wiser, you got yourself weakened by M16 stone and F17 lacks the strength. He may hasame at H17 and he gain some base.]

(;W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[kc]C[A :
This move is good because it takes white's chance to make base]
;W[mg]
(;B[lc]C[Too slow, maybe play elsewhere?
White desperately need base and connection, you remove his base so normally he seek connection, play at K13 instead]
;W[jg];B[mo];W[lp];B[pn];W[hg];B[ee]C[A :
An overplay, see variation]
(;W[de]C[A :
a nice move by white, the result will be different if he play as my variation]
;B[if];W[ig];B[ge]C[A :
a bit too soon, should threatn his connection first];W[lj];B[mk]
C[I considered my tengen stone as dead....

A :
noooo!
pity your tengen stone...
tengen has greatest flexibility, it can live easily because of more space available.]

I think this move is too small, see variation];W[hi];B[ef]TR[ee]

This move is a waste, black should not worry about connection because his E15, G15 and F13 stone cannot be cut.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[fj];B[ni];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb]
(;B[pc]C[Automatic play. I was convinced he was going to play P16 so I played as if he had played what I thought he would play. Bad habit, I know, but sometimes happens....

A:
If he does, you should not answer his move, let's see what happened IF he play on P16 and you choose not to answer his move]
;W[ka];B[kb]LB[mc:A]C[Right answer? I hesitated because I felt like something was missing at A

A :
Monkey jump worth 8 points and if you ignore, it will take all of your territory.]
