C[Hi, I'm Tom, and I play white in this game.  Black is a good friend of mine, so if you could review for both sides, that would be great.  In particular, the big midgame fight was very difficult to read.  Where were better plays (for white or black)?  A few plays could have easily changed the outcome of the game.  And also, what in the fuseki and joseki led to this fight?

Thanks.

Hi my name is Ian Davis, I will try to give you as much insight as I can into what went wrong and how to improve]

(;B[fc]LB[bd:A][cf:B]C[This move was new to me.  In retrospect, maybe my move was too slow?  Would a fighting play like f16 be better?

Black's move seems strange, there are two more usual ones at A and B]

A black play at Q10 would be big.];W[jc];B[ng]

This looks a bit clumsy to me.
The gap is still quite wide, no reason to start a fight yet.
I'd prefer to play elsewhere and think about invasion later.]

This seems reasonable to me, black could also try walking from the weak group]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[ln];B[ij];W[jk];B[jq]C[This seems like a key crossroads.  Black attempts to use white's aji as a threat, then build a way out.  Here white chose to tighten his net around the black middle stones and sacrifice the whole bottom.  Good choice?

I wouldn't sacrifice everything myself! White can live and retain the threat against the weak black stones.]

yes owing to your sacrifice suddenly they became weak!];B[gj]

It's hard to say yes or no. I can imagine it's possible to. I will show some tries.]

yes the sacrifice was very daring! you have to be certain you can kill when you take such a risk]

Interesting play by both sides. Try to focus on the simpler things though - don't leave groups weak. Don't make wild saacrifices when you have a simple attack to finish first.
