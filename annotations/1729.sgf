C[Hi, my nick is dredd at KGS.  I would like to have my game reviewed.  Thank you.



Hi, my name is Rainer.
I marked my comments in this game with R:

As you have not asked for a special analysis of your game I will just give you some general advice.

- You tend to make unnecessary moves that do not help you in any way. Try to avoid these moves and search for the urgent and big points to play on.

- Try to make your own territory before destroying the territory of your opponent. While you try to destroy, your opponent will strengthen his positions and counterattack with even more power.

I hope this review will help you.

If you should have questions, don's hesitate to ask.

Best regards

(;W[dj]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[R: This would have been a good time to make the kakari at either A or B]
;B[pj];W[po]LB[jp:A]C[I would like to know what other options do I have at this point?

R: You could continue your play with A without attacking as you would still be even with Black. You will end up with a cramped position after Q5]
;B[np];W[pl]C[R: Now you have a weak group. This weakness can and probably will be exploided by Black.]
;B[jp]C[It looks like black has a better position at this point.  So, should I played somewhere along the bottom side before I play at Q5?

R: See my comment on move 8.];W[nl]C[R: You are trying to get into the center do get some influence there. Perhaps you should make a save base befor that.]
;B[ll];W[nj]LB[pg:B][qg:A]CR[pj]C[R: Perhaps would something like A or B be better. You would put some pressure on the marked stone and attack the corner stone.]
;B[ph];W[gp]LB[ok:A]C[R: You leave the cutting point A open.]
;B[fc];W[fe]C[R: This is a dangerous move as the corner is far from save.]
;B[df];W[ee];B[eh];W[ch];B[eg];W[hd];B[hc]LB[hc:2][nc:C][oc:B]
[hd:1][nd:A]C[Again, it seems that this move only strengthens black position on the upper side, so should I invade at A first? or develop the lower left corner?

R: Yes, you should play in the upper right corner area befor playing 1. A, in my opinion, would be to high. Playing at B or C would be more profitable.]
;W[gd]C[R: Again you force Black to strengthen his position.]
;B[gc];W[cc]C[R: Good move, protecting the corner is important. Always remember, play urgent moves before big moves.]
;B[id];W[hf];B[gi]
(;W[gg]C[R: This move is definitely gote. Black has no need to protect and plays elsewhere. If you want to cut do it right away.]
