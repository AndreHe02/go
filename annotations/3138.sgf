C[buckyyowza: Hello, comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed with 'buckyyowza'.  I hope you enjoy reading my comments and find them to be of use.

To the reviewer:
Hello : ) Thanks for taking the time to review my game! I am white.

I found myself falling very far behind in this game, and I can do nothing but speculate as to why. I'm going to put some comments to try to let you know how I think.

Any help you can give is much appreciated! : )];B[qd];W[dp]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]TR[cd][qd]C[buckyyowza: d8 is also normal, and it relates reasonably well to the C16 stone (that is, it will be difficult for white to begin now on the left side). However, black's two opposing komoku (C16 and R16) are not the best shape; in black's position, I would prefer to see black's R16 stone at Q17 to better balance the upper side.  Perhaps, the upper side is a better place to begin an attack if that is your aim.

This black move is usually at C9. I thought to myself...I can probably attack this group if I get a stone in there on the left side. Plus, I don't want black's move here to become a good one.]
;W[ec]
(;B[gc]LB[df:B][ec:A]C[buckyyowza: I do not like a close low approach (E17) here: If black simply defends the corner at D14 as in the variation the result is not favorable for white.  However, black's choice to play a pincer works out quite nice (for white) in terms of thickness.]
;W[ee];B[df]
(;W[dh]SQ[ee]TR[cd][df][gc]LB[cb:C][ef:D][eg:A][hd:B]C[buckyyowza: I agree, D12 is not a good play here.  From a tewari viewpoint, black's D14 stone looks like a peep that threatens to cut the (long knight jump) shape created by white's E15 and E12 - Since it is now black's turn, the cut is inevitable.  Black's left side position is quite strong, so such a cut will leave white with two weak groups.  The normal play would be at H16 (see var) or C18.  I would tend toward the H16 play so that white's upper left thickness would face the white stones on the lower left and right. It is also worth note that black's D14 play is a lower shoulder hit, which is almost always bad style.  In order to follow up that shoulder hit, white could have begun a wall at E14 though in this position that would be too good for black.

I don't think this move was appropriate here. I'm never very good at handling the one space tight pincer. I guess that's why everyone likes to play it against me : )]
;B[ef];W[gd];B[hc];W[ff]LB[gf:B][he:A]C[buckyyowza: I would prefer not to hane here because black's stones are much stronger and the hane sequence makes a sacrifice out of D12 without much compensation.  It is like poking a tiger with a stick ;-) The plays at H15 and G14 take white out futher toward the center without this danger.]
;B[fg];W[gf];B[eh]
(;W[fc]LB[gg:A]C[buckyyowza: I prefer G13.  The aji of black G12 only creates a neutral area in the lower center, and otherwise white's influence will only improve from such a play.  A play like F17 is small gote, so it should only be reserved for when there is no other option for getting a second eye (or for the end game).]
;B[lc]TR[gc][hc]LB[ei:B][lc:A][qn:C]C[buckyyowza: Black's M17 play is a bit lackluster, in that the marked black stones are neither in danger nor are they that important.  I agree that the D11 is area is more important;  E11 is certainly a huge play for black!  However, I do not see an immediate way for white to salvage that side without digging a bigger hole somewhere else.  For now, I think it is best for both players to focus on the lower right side, around R6.

Had black played D11 instead of M17 I believe I would have been toast.]
;W[dj];B[cg];W[ei];B[fi];W[fj];B[gj];W[gi];B[fh];W[fk];B[hg]
;W[cb];B[nq];W[bh]LB[hi:A]C[buckyyowza: it is too soon, yes. stealing eye space is not really pointless, though :-)  B12 threatens the eye space of both groups.  It is too soon, however, because H11 is just too big to miss.

too soon and pointless? black could ignore this if he wants to.]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[bg];W[bq];B[ek]
(;W[ej]C[buckyyowza: This certainly seems sensible, but to me after taking so much effort to begin an attack on black's left side, why let him force you into this heavy shape.  See the variation for some other (probably equally questionable) ideas.]
;B[fl];W[bj]C[With this move I am aiming at C8.];B[cp]
(;W[cm];B[dm];W[dn];B[do];W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[cl]C[buckyyowza: actually, i like this quite a bit -)  White can extend at B7 and probably take half of black's stones.]

(;W[gl];B[dq];W[dr];B[ep];W[eq];B[fm];W[hj];B[gm]
(;W[bc]LB[ie:A][ii:B]C[buckyyowza: not so tiny, but quite poorly timed.  Remember to enclose the outside of a group before leaning against the inside.  Because this does not threaten black in any way, it is gote.  In this area, start at J15 or even J11.

Tiny move. No wonder I fell so far behind!];B[go];W[iq];B[kq]
;W[hp]TR[qi]LB[oc:A]C[buckyyowza: Yes.  At this point, the game is such a mess that a reasonable count would be difficult to estimate.  When I see this kind of game start to happen I like to grab as many big spaces as are left available instead of making the mess even bigger;  this way, if white can get some big points the fight becomes much simpler.  Unless white begins to grab areas like R11 and P17 there is little hope in the game except a few enjoyable skirmishes.

I don't like this move much anymore. Playing again I would probably play R11.]
;B[qq]C[buckyyowza: Black is all attack in this game, and the best way for white against such an opponent is to be patient and wait for him to fall on his face.  I would play at Q3 here before R4.

I don't feel I can R4. Tenuki is an option, but I don't know where to play. Black seems way ahead.]
;W[pq]
(;B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qn];W[np];B[mq];W[ko]
C[buckyyowza: I disagree, this is an excellent play: Black should not have played at R4.  Now the entire lower side belongs to white and black's lower right corner is not much in return (10 points vs. 25 points).

A move made without reading. False intuition is the killer of all go players ; )

I asked my opponent where he would play as white, and he suggested O6 to my P7 suggestion.

I've gotten myself deep in muck. The rest of the game is nothing but me trudging about, trying to find my way out.]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[mn];B[no]
(;W[nn]LB[pn:A]C[buckyyowza: how about Q6?];B[oo];W[on];B[pn]
;W[lp]C[buckyyowza: The situation is already bad, but this play forces black to make eyes and virutally eliminate the P3 stones' aji. After the P5 cut, it is best to move on and use your aji for later in the game.]
;B[mp];W[lq];B[kp];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[jr];W[jq];B[op];W[ls]
C[A silly move. : )];B[qo];W[ns];B[ms];W[pj];B[ks]C[buckyyowza: Quite an oversight, most likely due to frustration ;-)  There are two main things that will help you prevent this sort of game in the futue:

1) A good knowledge of opening strategy and which areas of the board are the most important throughout the game will help you to find where the points are, so that losing 5 stones doesn't become a devastating blow.  Observe some 5 dan games played at about 1/8 (or :40 byo yomi), and notice when and where they tenuki.  You will certainly get some ideas without much trouble.

2) Walk away from the fight!  Black played quite aggressive in this game and you chose to remain in the war zone and let him stay on the attack the whole time.  To reiterate, you've got to keep moving around if you want to survive the game.  Judging from black's play, I'd say he primarily reached his level by killing as much as possible as fast as possible.  I reached the 5 kyu level in about a year playing like this... and that was about 6 years ago.  I've gained a whole 4 stones since, and only through going back and studying all that opening strategy, counting, life-death and other stuff I should have been paying attention to the whole time.  As a general rule of thumb, do not become engaged in a battle until at least move 120; instead as soon as you feel reasonably safe enough take sente and play somewhere else.  There are usually many big plays somewhere on the board before then - once the fight is down to 20 points then move on and take 50 -)

Thanks for the chance to look over this game.  I have played one like it more times than I care to mention.  I recall giving 4 stones once and resigning on about move 40 because of a misread ladder.  There have been other times when the mistake was not so obvious ;-)  I hope I have shed some light on things for you, so that next time you run into a fighter you can calmly take a more non-violent path to winning.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about this game, or look for me as 'bucky' on IGS.  I am also 'bucky' on KGS, but I have not played there much for quite some time.

The dramatic conclusion to a hopeless game.

In this game I feel like I was white against two handicap! : o

I hope that you can help me so that I never play this badly again.

Again, thank you for your comments!])

;W[hj]C[buckyyowza: No big kills, but this is not much different from the game except that white now has 3 liberty aji (around B7) against a 5 liberty group that black cannot afford to lose.  It is like putting money in the bank because black is not quite alive yet, and this could easily come back to haunt him.]

[am][an][bd][be][bf][bg][bh][bi][bj][bk][bl][bm][cf][cg][ck]
[cl]TR[gc]C[buckyyowza: white's shape is quickly improving, but also helpling black to secure a minimum of 24 points on the left side, and probably another 10 in the upper left corner.  However...]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[od]C[buckyyowza: black will find the upper half of the board to be quite a difficult place to accomplish much unless he sacrifices a large portion of the upper right in order to live small there, such as by playing a pincer now instead of the more common joseki]

(;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jd]C[buckyyowza: the more common joseki - clearly a good result for white]
)
(;B[mc];W[ne];B[jd];W[pg]TR[mc][qd]C[buckyyowza: The pincer - now white's profit is in thickness, and a gote option to take the upper right corner. Continue this variation to see why black's marked stones are cut.]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[pd];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[md]C[buckyyowza: this way black has to find sabaki on the upper side and will either lose sente or die trying to keep it.]
)))
(;B[df];W[gd]LB[hc:A][hd:B][id:C]C[buckyyowza: white can settle anywhere around G16]
;B[oc]LB[ic:A][nq:B]C[buckyyowza: black is better here, territorially speaking. A black stone such as J17 or O3 will very quickly erase white's potential on the sides.  Consequentially, black has no such weakness in his moyo.]
