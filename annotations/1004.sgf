RE[B+Resign]

C[Hi,

Could you review this game? It is one of my first
online and I'm very frustrated because I seemed to
keep going wrong at every turn. I played white. I also
want to know how I could have saved the large stone
group toward the end, before I resigned.

Thanks so much!
Chris K

z:
Game reviewed by Dimitri ("zenjutsu" on IGS, 12k*).  I will preface
my comments with the "z:" notation (as above).

Groundrules:  (1) I always extend an open invitation to further
questions and/or comments regarding this game or my commentary
on it.  (2) While I will try to give solid guidance, remember
that I am only a 12k so my comments are bound to have flaws of
their own.  (3) I try to comment both black and white moves because
they both always offer learning experiences.];B[pc];W[cp];B[qp]
;W[dc]C[Danthekyu comments (dtk)
I'm a 4k IGS, so I'm not that strong myself. My comments and advice should be taken that way
1st comment: at your starting level, try to stick to openings with the 4-4 point until you feel comfortable enough with them (for exemple in your handicap games)]
;B[jc]TR[pc]C[since delta is low, maybe should be on 4th line]
;W[jp];B[pj]C[ok];W[dj]C[z:
At this point, I started to wonder if white was playing a "mirror"
strategy.  I do not think white is, however if they are then
they should be aware that "mirror" strategies are generally not
the most productive fuseki.];B[jj]C[Dtk: ok, playable];W[oq]

(;B[pr]TR[lq][lp][mp][op][pn][po][mq]C[z:
I am not familiar with this joseki.  In the joseki I've seen,
when white approaches at the 3-5, black responds with a pincer,
cap, or move up the side (marked with triangles).];W[pq]TR[ep]
[de][pe][pf][qf][qe][lp][lq][mp][mq][pn][po]C[z:
Too slow.  This stone only gains you a few points, and costs
black a few in the corner.  It also allows black to solidify
his corner, thus eliminating the possibility of any future attack.
There are plays on the board elsewhere, or in this area, which
are worth more points.  I've marked some samples with triangles.
Unfortunately, I am uncertain which would be best.];B[qq]C[z:
Black makes the expected block, which solidifies his corner.]

(;W[or]TR[mq][lq][lp][mp]SQ[gc][fp][fq][eq][ep][df][cf][ce]
[de][md][pe][pm]C[z:
If I were black, I'd ignore this move.  While it helps secure
your side, the side is not too secure right now.  Black can still
attack at any of the triangle points.  Furthermore, if white
plays R2, it is a smaller loss of points than black could gain
by playing any of the square points (as examples).  When somebody
plays a stone that does not require a response, such as white's
in this case, it is called "tesuji".
dtk:no a tesuji is a skillfull play];B[qs]C[dtk simply bad]

(;W[os]TR[lp][lq][mq]SQ[ep][de][pf][qf][qe][pe]C[z:
Another move that is too early.  This move can be played later,
in the late mid-game or the end-game.  The move does not maintain
"sente" (which translates as "initiative") because it does not
threaten black.  Also, it does not _secure_ white's side because
black could still invade at the triangle spots.  White could
dtk:bad move
_secure_ the bottom by playing one of the triangles, or even
N5.  Or, white could play elsewhere, such as at one of the squares.
dtk: bad];B[qn]SQ[oo][pm]C[z:
Black is being very cautious.  I would probably place this stone
at one of the square points, or (more likely) play elsewhere
on the board.];W[hd]TR[no][mq][lq][lp][mo][mp]C[z:
Good.  Time to move away from the bottom right, unless it is
to _secure_ the area at a triangle point.]
(;B[nn]C[z:
Good.  Black does two things with this play: (1) maintains sente
because white must respond or risk losing the four stones in
bottom right, and (2) uses the threat of capturing the four stones
to build their own territory.
dtk: too close to your own thickness
black should attack white territory];W[mp]C[z:
...white must respond....];B[je]TR[md][fp][fq][eq][ep][df][cf]
[ce][de][pe]C[z:
...and black continues to build.  Personally, I would play this
stone elsewhere if I were black.  Perhaps a triangle point.]
;W[qe]C[z:
Good!  Black was building a moyo which is FAR too large.  If
white does not invade now, the opportunity to do so may be lost.]
;B[qd]C[z:
Interesting.  My limited understanding of joseki indicates that
this response by black is _not_ a recommended reply to white's
3-5 approach.  White can extend and make a threat (see upcoming
alternative white move tree).]
(;W[rd]C[z:
Probably not the best response.  Too easy for black to block.]
;B[rc]
(;W[sd]C[z:
Again, easy for black to block, and it isn't giving a strong
shape for eyes.]
(;B[sc]C[dtk:bad];W[rf]C[z:
Good.];B[pe];W[pf]C[z:
Good.  the support of S14 allows white to do this without hesitation.]
;B[oe]
(;W[qi]C[z:
Making space for eyes.  Good.];B[qj];W[rj]TR[qh][ri][pi]C[z:
Hmmm.... not a very solid play.  Easy for black to block, and
white probably has to respond, which wastes a stone in this race.
Perhaps a triangle instead?
dtk: ok!!];B[rk]
(;W[sj]C[z:
Risky.  Black does not have to respond to this, and can try to
attack white's eye shape.
dtk not ok];B[qh]C[z:
Perhaps too harsh.  White can most likely block this attack.
See upcoming alternative move tree.]
(;W[rh];B[qg]
(;W[qf];B[pi];W[ri];B[rg]C[z:
White is on verge of death, but can still make a run for the
center (see alternate move tree).]
(;W[sg];B[se];W[re];B[sh]C[z:
Now white has only one eye and one false eye.  The only hope
is to run to center, or use the group as aji later in game.]
;W[sf];B[og]C[z:
...and now center appears unattainable.];W[of];B[nf];W[rl];B[sk]
;W[ig]C[z:
Good.  Cut your losses and play elsewhere.  Good.];B[jg];W[jh]
C[z:
A little aggressive, but white appears far behind in score, so
a little aggression may be necessary to make some magic happen.]
;B[kg];W[jl];B[ji];W[ih];B[kh];W[lk]C[z:
This jump may be capturable.];B[kk]C[z:
...black makes the first cut.];W[kl]TR[ll]C[z:
Now black could probably make the second cut at triangle and
prevent the white finger into black's center.];B[np];W[jk]TR[lj]
[ml][ll][ep][de]C[z:
Too slow.  Better plays exist that are worth more points.  Triangle
points are examples.];B[kj];W[nq];B[op]
(;W[pp]TR[ij][lm][ml][ll][hj][de][ep]C[z:
Too slow.  Only threatens to reduce black by a few points.  I
think I'd play a triangle instead.

(;W[ib]C[z:
Right idea (reduce black while building self).  Not certain if
it's the right place.

;W[lb];B[fj]TR[fp][fq][eq][ep][el][fl][fm][gm][hm][ch][dh][ce]
C[z:
Ouch.  White's 8 stones are dead.

While the game is not done yet, white has no real hopes of winning.
Black has large, secure territory, and white has very little.
Black can still invade white at triangles.  Black has definitely
won at this point.

GAME SUMMARY:

The early exchange in the bottom right heavily favored black.
Black built a large and secure framework in the bottom right
with fairly efficient plays, while white had a slender and unsecure
side built with overly concentrated stones.  This triggered white
to invade, which was good; however white's capture on the right
was catastrophic and could have been prevented with more joseki
and life-and-death study.  The capture build black's strength,
and did not give anything to white.  White needed to make life
with that group.

In summary, white may benefit from (1) counting the value of
plays to ensure they are not making end-game plays during the
"fuseki" (early game) or mid-game, (2) studying joseki to help
with invading and protecting corners, and (3) studying life-and-death
problems to better understand making two eyes with tightly surrounded
groups.    The only comments from here forward in game are smattered random
comments, and response to white's specific request for analysis
of the top group, and an end-of-file comment pointing here for
game summary.];W[fi]C[not reading];B[ei];W[ej];B[gj];W[eh];B[hj]

...especially not now.];W[mf]C[z:
Black can ignore this.  White currently has no eyes.  The _potential_
for one on the bottom (if white plays M19 before black does)
and the _potential_ for one here (if white plays L14 before black
does).  However, since both _potential_ eyes require moves, black
can play elsewhere, allow white to make a single eye, and then
close the other eye thus preventing life.];B[nh]C[z:
Black plays the safe route.  Considering the size of the group,
and the risk if it survives-- as well as black's currently sizable
lead-- an appropriate choice.];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[mg];W[lh]

No no no.  Black should just play M19 to kill the top eye.  Allow
white to make this eye, and ignore the ko.  Quicker, easier,
and no ko battle needed.];W[qk];B[si];W[ng];B[la]C[z:
