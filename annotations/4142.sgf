C[Hi GoAnderson,

my current rank is 16k, so please take my comments with care. I preceded my comments with "Axel:". 

During the game you and your opponent basically made the same errors:

- Attaching too much value to single stones. I.e., you tried to rescue every stone you played. In order to do so, you have to play a few moves and gain no territory. Your sole gain is that your opponent did not get the point for capturing your stone,  which is hardly worth the trouble.  Furthermore your opponent can/will take advantage of your inclination to rescue every stone.
- Playing endgame moves too early. Repeatedly you and your opponent decided the precise border between your groups while much bigger points awaited to be taken. A play on the first or second line is a good sign for an endgame move. Learn to not play those moves until the life/death status of every group has been decided and you cannot extend anymore from your position. Additionally, learn to not respond to those moves and take a bigger point instead.
- Inefficient opening. Normally one starts by first taking the corners, then the sides and then extend into the center. This sequence is the most efficient one in terms of territory and influence.  In the game, the left side was ignored while both of you were concerned extending into the corner.

So, enjoy the review and feel free to email me in case you have any question.
/Axel

Played April 17, 2006 on KGS.

White: GoAnderson, 25k?

Black: vitor, 25k

Komi: 6.5

Result: White wins by 7.5

Comments: I feel I fluked here. Being myself I started by passing, due to some ridiculous clicking off-game, but thankfully vitor was gracious enough to allow its remedy. The game itself was exciting for me, especially as I made one stupid mistake after another... To win by nearly eight points is shocking. I'd like to know why, and so I've sent this to the Go Teaching Ladder. Please, go easy on me.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[qf];W[pi]C[Would a jump to O16 or 17 be better, or a tighter pincer? In the end I just decided, "Aw, to cain with it!" and slapped down this stone.

Axel: Yes, O16/O17 would have been way better. I like it when beginners start to experiment with pincers, but you have to take a look at the whole side to decide whether a pincer is doable at all. In this position black has a 4-4 stone in the lower right corner and thus your marked stone is on his own in case black decides to jump out. To make this more clear: Suppose black had played at O17 instead of R14, a pincer would then have been excellent as it would be a nearly perfect extension from your upper left corner.]
;B[oh];W[oi]LB[pl:A]C[Axel: Obviously your goal was to isolate (or even kill?) the black stones. But this is way too aspiring as black has a lot of options to take advantage of this. Pincers almost always lead to fights. Furthermore both of your connected stones have bad shape, thus giving black easy attacking possibilities (e.g. at 'A') and thus easy profit.]
;B[od]C[Axel: Gross overplay by black. his stones can easily be cut]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[pc]C[Axel: too conservative. No need to connect directly. More of concern is that your stones have almost no shape. Thus you are weaker than you ought to.]
;B[nc]C[Axel: playing at the star point at K16 is now a good extension for both players.]
;W[qe];B[pf];W[rf]C[Axel: rather slow (== inefficient at this stage). Your corner stones are alive and connecting to the ones below gains you too little. It is easier to make a base for both your stones (P11,Q11) right away. Remember, a play on the second line is seldom efficient enough during fuseki.]
;B[rg]C[Axel: black should have ignored your move and taken a side instead]
;W[re]C[Axel: again unnecessary as your stones are alive nonetheless.]
;B[ob]C[Axel: a move on second line is typical of the endgame.]
;W[pb]SQ[ob][nc][nd][od][pf][qf][rg][oh]C[Axel: You chose to protect your eye space. I'm not sure whether you had to, but it is better to choose the safer way until you can read the situations out. Note that black's stones have neatly surrounded your corner stones and contained them to the corner. Thus the exchange was quite successful for black, although his stones on the right side are overconcentrated (they should project influence down the side but are hindered in doing so by your stones.)]
;B[oa]C[Axel: endgame move. and a very bad move too. It is important that you learn to not answer such moves. Huge territories await to be taken, fiddling about the precise border is not the issue.]
;W[pa];B[mb]C[I've not seen or heard of any joseki like this pattern. White gains a few points in sente and Black builds a wall to stare down the rest of the board... Black's the favorite by now, I'd suppose.


Axel: Just the first four or five moves can be considered joseki. A good joseki reference is "Kogo's Joseki dictionary", which can be found online (Just google for it.).  Yes, black has the advantage as the walls he has built are a lot more worth than white's twelve points. A more efficient and enjoyable way to improve your joseki instead of learning them by heart is to learn tesujis. These employ the techniques necessary to understand why a certain move is joseki. And playing tesuji your opponent didn't anticipate is always fun :)]
;W[on]TR[pm]C[Axel: Good idea, you recognized that you have to stabilize both stones at P/Q11. Two points have to be critizised: Firstly, you played on the fifth line, which does not form a base. You have to play on the third or fourth line for this. Secondly, you extended too far from your stones. The proverb goes "Extend two from one stone, extend three from two stones." 

Thus the triangle would have been a good place to play.];B[mp]
;W[qn];B[nn]C[Axel: A short criticism of this move:
- Black is strong above and below while you have an overextended position. A contact play in this position erases a lot of aji and thus black will not get as much out of this position as he deserves.
- It is way too small in this stage of the game. Remember, the basic opening strategy is to first take the corners, then the sides and then extend into the center . Due to black's thickness in the upper right corner, the left side is the most valuable point at the moment.]
;W[om];B[gq];W[nm]C[I didn't know what to do, so I blocked, hoping to run into the center and keep that side territory. I considered S10, but I also considered that it would be putting all my eggs in one basket.

Axel: Well, take a look at the position:

a) Your group at the right (variations): It is safe. Determining the precise border is part of the late middle game and end game. Basically your group in the upper right corner together with the R6 stone render a black invasion infeasible.

b) The lower side: pretty fortified by black, a moyo is in the making. A good invasion/reduction is called for. But these are more advanced techniques, for which you need a good understanding of influence.

c) The upper side: White cannot extend along the side too far as black's position on the right is strong. On the other hand black should not approach white's corner (D16) from the right as this violate the principles of influence ("Drive your opponent towards your thickness", "Do not use thickness to claim directly territory").

d) The left side: The side star point is still to be taken and a good extension for white (because he cannot extend to the right) and for black as well (good extension, builds formidable moyo in the lower left). Extra bonus is neglecting your opponent a very good move.

A note on your move: It is called "thousand dollar turn" and it is actually a  very good move, just too early. Remember this move, when you have gained a deeper understanding of thickness, you will appreciate it :)]

(;B[mn];W[ll];B[mm];W[ml];B[rj];W[qk]C[Axel: see my previous comments.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[kn]C[too small.];W[jk]C[Axel: Your group is already alive. Extending your territory this way is too slow. Taking territory along the side is safer.]
;B[el]C[Axel: Good idea, but a play on the fifth line is easily invaded (on the third line)]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[oo]C[Axel: the last moves gained black ca. 7 points. Endgame moves. You should have ignored them and taken larger territories.]

(;W[po];B[np];W[rh]TR[qg]C[This was a point in the game I was very unsure of. I did, however, figure that I had nothing to lose at this point and, if I could kill those four stones below somehow, I'd be in a better condition. Seems an overplay, though.

Axel: It is in the wrong place.  Black has a weakness, the cutting point at R13. The peep at R12 takes advantage of this. Your stone forces black into a better position..]
;B[qh]C[Axel:  ... as his weakness has been fixed and his groups are connected.]
;W[sg]C[Axel: Rescuing your stone is too small. Remember, a play on the second or even first line is typical of the endgame.]
;B[qi];W[qg];B[ph];W[pg];B[of]C[Axel: good connecting move by black. Although it has a weakness which you spotted but did not exploit.]
;W[cf];B[hc]C[Axel: Black does not take full advantage of his thickness. In this position you nearly always extend all the way, i.e. F17.]
;W[ng]C[Bah, idiotic move. Shoot me now.

Axel: No, I would not say that it is a bad move. Actually I like it :) . Your follow-up was not ok.]
;B[og]C[Axel: black is forced to connect. Otherwise his group on the side dies.]

(;W[rg]C[Axel: Hmm. I probably said it a thousand times by now: You played an endgame move. You made two points in gote. Usually these are the last endgame moves one plays.]
;B[ni]SQ[oi][pi][pj]C[black spotted the correct place to take advantage of your bad shape: Your marked stones form an empty triangle, a very weak formation due to its few liberties.]

(;W[mk];B[nk]C[It took me a bit but I figured out what vitor was aiming for. So, I responded at Q9... But was my previous move dubious? What should I have played besides the simple block?]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[nl]
(;B[mg]C[Axel: too tight by black. Better catch a stone on a large scale, i.e. by forming a moyo (see variation). I would have ignored the sole white stone and taken more territory along the side. Territory in the center is always harder to defend than on the side.]

[qc][rc][sc][qd][rd][sd][se][sf][ol][pl][pm][qm][pn]C[Done solely to take sente... Aji-keshi?

Axel: No Sente. This is an endgame move, roughly four points in gote. Black should have ignored it. Aji-keshi refers to destroying aji. Black's stones are solidly connected, thus no aji to destroy.]
;B[nj];W[je]C[Axel: Reductions and invasions are a valuable technique you should strive to master. But you have to understand the concept of thickness and how it relates to territory in order to understand when an invasion/reduction is successful.]
;B[jf]C[Axel: Never ever do a contact play against a weak stone. Just catch him on a large scale.]
;W[ie];B[fd];W[hf];B[jh]SQ[jf][mg]C[Axel: Now you see that the contact play did not restrict white possibilities sufficiently. Note that black's stones form good shape though.]
