C[Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen. I'm finnish 5k. 

In the beginning of the game you had problems in reading the whole board situation. Furthermore your corner invasion was a bit early to the lower right corner. Somehow it seems that you early moves seek a handicap game atmosphere... 

In the midgame there was some tactic moves that you missed which I try to point out during the review.

Hope this has any help for you and enjoy the game of Go.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[dq]LB[co:B][do:A]C[JT: The marked white stone gives black a chance to prevent the corner enclosure and at the same time make a strong position on the right side. Also this gives nice moyo for black. Therefore instead the sanrensei good points for black to play are a or b.]

(;B[jd];W[cn]TR[jp][jq]C[JT: When white plays the corner enclosure blacks urgent point is to take away the optimal extension from it  which are marked on the board. Otherwise if white gets this point, the invasion towards the corner enclosure gives white too much area.]

(;B[pj]TR[pd]C[JT: in general this move is correct, its the optimal extension from the marked star point stone. But it doesn't take into account the whole board situation. So  it should be in the K3 or K4.]

(;W[qm];B[qq]C[JT: This move is way too small and early. Still the K3 or K4 is possible.]

;W[mp]LB[jp:A][kp:C][jq:B][kq:D]C[JT: The corner invasion was too early because you only take there few points and at the same time white gains lots of influence towards the corner enclosure. Luckily white didn't took advantage from it. White could play the marked white stone into A,B,C or D, which would make your opponent a nice moyo.]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[nr];B[ms]C[JT: Some variation on what other choices white would have on handling this.]

C[When I played this, I was hoping too seal him in to the side.

JT: Makes nice framework for black.];W[rf];B[jj]LB[fc:A][qc:B]
C[I thought this moved looked good, but maybe there are some other better possibilities?

JT: It makes nice moyo for black. Though it is still very easy to reduce. For instance in A or B. In the game white made quite "exotic" approaches.]

See variations.

White group would still have to struggle for eyes, and while black is chasing him, you can make your own groups stronger.]

;B[kh]TR[df][dk]C[JT: Atleast these two marked moves would be nice for black at this point. The weakness in the upper left corner is seen with in next moves. Black would be more solid if there would ne stone in D14.]

;B[ii];W[jh];B[ji]LB[df:A]TR[gj][gk]C[JT: The E16 cut is now very dangerous. Especially when white has those two marked stones as an aiji. Joseki move for defend that cut would be in A. 
When white made the connection and secured the upper group, you ended up white lots of cutting points. Therefore the A move would have secured a lot and removed tha aiji of the marked stones. There will be examples later on the possibilities that white had.]
