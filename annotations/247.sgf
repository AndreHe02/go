C[dear reviewer,

thanks for your labor.

in this game, i take white and find somewhere confused. i have reviewed it myself, and put some questions forward to request your guide. after your finishing evaluating all of my moves, would you please point out in which field should i improve myself most urgently and what is the best way?

your assistance will be greatly appreciated.

sincerely,

china];B[dd];W[pc];B[cp];W[pq]C[i like komoku rather than hoshi, because the former has more variations, but unfortunately it develops slowly along the border(needs another move to protect the corner).]
;B[eq]LB[qe:a][qo:b][cj:c][dj:d]C[generally, it has more value to protect the komoku(a,b) than to split the border(c), but here i dislike black's d to make a moyo along the left side.   your guide please?]
;W[cj]C[HK:  White 6. I would move here too.];B[po]LB[np:a]
[qq:b][qr:c][qp:d][or:e][qk:f]C[if white plays a, then b,c,d,e,f as the sequence, white has lost some territories in the left-lower corner first and has no definite recompense else where, so a is not good.

HK:  Black's left-lower corner shimari is already restricting the influence of right-lower white.

So the value of Black 7 is a little less than that of Q15.

And the joseki you proposed here is not good for white, because black's extention to R9 is too beautiful.  I propose an alternative example sequence in the variation.]

[np:j]C[i am afraid white's 8 leaves choice for black's a to make moyo along the bottom with the sequence b,c, then white answers with d,e or f, but black can always exchange g with white's h first, and return to get the critical point i.

white'8 seems not good, but i do not like its another choice j either(the explanation is at the former move).

what about your response to black's 7?

HK:  White 8.  White 8 and the sequence you proposed here is not bad for white. After black i and white d white has aims of invasion at M3 and E5.]

[pj:h]C[obviously black wants the following sequence from a to h, then h can do two tasks with only one move, which is what i do not prefer. so i decide to put my next stone at the right border to split black's 7,9 and 11, but where it should go is quite a problem.

there are several variations which i have thinked over.

HK:  The sequence (from a to h) you proposed here is not bad for white.

white has aim
 of invasion at   s12 or S8.]
(;W[ph]C[finally i selected q12, but i do not know whether it is proper or not.

here your guide is valuable.

HK:  White 12.  Not bad, but I would prefer R15.];B[pn];W[nq]
;B[pj]C[i think black is good here, because its 15 achieved two goals, one is to extend itself, the other is to attack white's 12.]

(;W[nd]C[HK:  White 16.  I think O12 instead is better.

Let's try a variation. (one move back)];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[qd]C[HK:  Black 19.  No need of black 19.

One move back and refer to the variation.];W[rb];B[ne];W[md]
C[i think black's 21 is not good, because it lost some territories with white's 22, but its follow-up move is quite severe.]
;B[nh]C[HK:  Black 23.  A little thin move.  O13 may be better.]
;W[oi]LB[of:a][mg:b]C[white wants to escape first, and then aims at the combination of a and b to cut and attack black.]
;B[mj]
(;W[nk]C[HK:  White 26.  White should move at P10 instead.  Black can cut apart it.  See the variation here and the previous one.]

(;W[oj]C[HK:  White 28.  white should connect with bamboo joint.

Refer to the variation. (one move back)];B[ll]C[but black gained with 23,25,27 and 29.

what about your suggestion against black's 23?];W[qj];B[qk]

(;W[rj]C[HK:  White 32.  White should try to cut apart the outer black group.  Let's try a variation.  (one move back)]
;B[qg]C[good shape, black gave itself a little base and aimed the cut of white's 30 and 32.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[pg];B[pf];W[rk];B[rl];W[pi]C[white's 38 induced black's block, and made black can not ignore white'40, otherwise white's take of black'15 will be sente.]

;B[op]LB[mo:a][mn:b]C[white was afraid of being enclosed by black's follow-up move around a or b, so did not connect. but the result came out not good to white either.

your guide please?

HK:  Very hard situation for white.  But white can not help but connect at P3.  Let's try some variations.]

;W[mq];B[mn];W[lp];B[lo];W[rg]LB[nn:a]C[white wanted to settle itself first with 58(at least make one eye in sente), and then cut at a to fight the ko. if white could win the ko, black would be busy in making alive, and it has no choice to semeai with white's right group, but...]
;B[mp];W[mg]LB[kp:a][lq:b][mr:c][lr:d][ns:e][jq:f][mo:g]C[white wanted to separate black with 60, and then attack, at least white could go out into the center by this attacking.

as for the ko in the bottom, if possible, white wants to extend at a, if then b,c,d,e,f, white has g, so black could not enclose white easily. if black take action there first by b, then c,d,e, black needs to capture white's 56 with a, so white can get sente to play else where.]
;B[oc];W[od];B[pd];W[pb];B[ng];W[mi]LB[me:a]C[white should play a first, which is sente and thick, as well as provent black's a which is also sente.

;W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[fc]LB[rf:a]C[at this time, i think the game is good to black, so white did not secure its life with a, and kenuki with 72 to try to make moyo along the upper side. i think white's right group can not die easily.]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[qf];W[qi];B[si]C[white had only one eye and could not connect with its upper-right corner.]
;W[nj]C[white wanted to escape out, or semeai with black's upper-right group, which had not two eyes definitely either.]

(;B[li]C[HK:  Black 79.  Black should move at M10 to establish his win.  One move back and let's try some variations.]
;W[lk];B[mh];W[mk]C[HK:  White escaped already.  So Black should cut at M3 now.]
;B[kk]LB[kj:a][kl:b][lj:c][ki:d]C[white was not willing to escape out with the sequence a,b and c, because the road to escape is to narrow. and wanted to play d instead of c, but black had the choice to cut at c, then...]

(;W[re]LB[kj:a][ki:b]C[white attempted to see what is black's answer. if black ignored it and enclosed white inside, white could connect.   but now i think white should play a,b combination of course, for leaving the choice for black to enclose white inside has no good.]
;B[rf]LB[kj:a]C[if i were black, i would like to play a to enclose white in sente.

your guide of the choice?

HK:  Of course black should move at a.];W[sf];B[sd]C[here in the game, suddenly i found the exchange of white's 84 and 86 with black's 85 and 87 is bad to white, because...

(see variation please.)

HK:  Black should move at L10 even now.]
(;W[kj];B[kl];W[ki];B[lg];W[kh];B[kf];W[le];B[kg];W[lh]C[at last, this move made white fly out and annihilated black's one eye at n13 at the same time.

^_^];B[lq]C[i wonder if black should continue to play in the center, for black's 97 would be gote.]
;W[mr];B[lr]C[HK:  Black 99. Black should move at L4 ponnuki instead.]
;W[ns];B[kp]LB[jd:a][hi:b]C[this game adjourned here by me, because i had scheduled an appointment at that time.

i did not escape ^_^

to tell the truth, i still think the game is favor to black now. black's big group has two eyes in gote, while white has one. and black's bottom, left-lower and right-lower are quite thick, while white only has 15 points in the right-lower corner and a moyo in the upper side.

but white has sente now! there are two good points to my view now ---- a and b ( i prefer a).

what about your judgement at this very stage?

(thanks for your patience to review my game.)

HK:  Black passed up a lot of chances to secure his win.  But he still keeps his advantage.  At the end of my review I would like to give some points to both players.

I feel you both are not so good at life and death, shape and tesuji.  Life and death problems and tracing pro's game will be helpful to your improvement.

Thank you.
