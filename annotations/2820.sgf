C[Dear reviewer,
please review this game for white. Although I won by resign the game was tight until black made a mistake in the very late stage of the game. Until there black was on the way to win the game by some points.
I made some remarks at the decisive stages.
Thank you in advance.
Thomas

Comment: I'll do my best :)];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[qf]
;B[qh];W[of];B[md]LB[qc:B][nd:A]C[Comment: Always played at A. It gives a better result when white invades at B.]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rj];B[rk];W[rh];B[sj];W[qg]C[I think this is a good result for white.

Comment: I think it is over concentrated, though. Moreover there is aji on the stone.]
;B[ok];W[jp]LB[qn:A]C[Comment: I would've played at A];B[qn]
;W[np];B[qq]C[But now I regret. Better I'd played r6 instead of k4. When I separate the r3-stone with r4 the white wall faces only a strong black position.
I am right with this?];W[qp];B[rp]
(;W[ro]C[Comment i think that now black is strong so you'd better try to make points.]

(;W[cf]C[Comment: Now your influence is spoiled.];B[dn]
(;W[ef]C[Comment: It's much better to pincer, because it has a double purpose: put some pressure on the black stone, and extend your stone.]

Comment: I would advise you to be consistent: B3 was played to remove the base. Why not continue ?]

;B[pr];W[nq]C[Whith this situation a was very happy. Black has a weak group for attacking and I can still hope to invade the upper left side.
My groups seem to be segure and below I have a big potential for territory. But...

Comment: Black group is not that weak. Besides, i don't think you have that much profit to gain for the attack. Finally, i think you have to do something in the north. Conclusion: Black has a comfortable  lead, to me.]

C[I am happy that i could connect the corner with the edge but now the potential of territory shrank.

Comment: indeed. What you have to be aware of is that black is much stronger now also.]
;W[bd]C[I tried to play sente until I can secure the side below.

Comment i still think it's urgent to invade.];B[cc];W[oc];B[od]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[hn]C[Better h5?

Comment. definitely];B[go];W[hp];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[bh];B[ci]
;W[ch];B[ck]C[Happy that I can tenuki. All groups are safe.
Time to count:
Black: 42 upper side
 12 left
 12 right
 68

White 35 below
 8 right
 10 center
 53

I have to make territory in the center! Let's try.

Comment: i don't think you can make territory in the center, because it's open in various places.]
;W[ie];B[if]C[Overplay by black?];W[je];B[id];W[ke];B[kd]
(;W[lf]C[n8 bigger?

Comment: no, you cannot allow blck to play M15.];B[oi];W[ph]

Comment. see ? you don't make points in the center :)];B[kj]
;W[jj];B[ih];W[ig];B[kh];W[ii];B[jh];W[hh];B[mh]C[Now it is a tight game. I made some territory in the center but couldn't catch up totally. L11 was a big mistake.]
;W[pj]C[Now i tried to make as much sente move as possible.

Comment: This is your privilege. moreover this move is aji keshi (think of Q8)]
