C[Adalberto [7k\]: hi];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[ep];W[hp]C[TJ: It's funny that White should choose this joseki. Because Q3 is low on the bottom, it would be hard for her to get the most out of building thickness facing in that direction. On the other hand, the high two-space pincer leads to some really tricky lines, including the famous "Magic Sword" joseki. Sometimes, knowing a complicated set of joseki well can be a valuable weapon, because your opponents could go so wrong locally at an early stage that it would matter little if the joseki was in fact the wrong choice for the whole board. That said, it's probably better to learn to choose joseki appropriately :-)]

(;B[dn]LB[dm:A][en:B]C[TJ: This doesn't look bad, but there are two other ways of playing that you might prefer.

It is essentially a 5-4 point joseki, but H4 has its effects.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dq]C[TJ: This is weird: D7 is a massive point.]
(;W[cq]
(;B[cm]C[TJ: I cannot believe this is good for Black - you've got too many cutting points. D7 looks much safer and stronger. Running along the fourth line is never a bad deal for you, although it does give solid profit to the other player.]

(;W[bn];B[cr];W[br];B[dm];W[kq]
(;B[gq]C[TJ: This is playing too near to thickness. Better is A, which is large in addition to being aggressive.

That said, you "thickness" has is imperfect, so perhaps G3 is in some ways necessary to patch up the cutting points. That is your punishment for playing the odd-shape move at D3 a few moves ago.]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[ir]
(;B[qj]C[TJ: Good - you realise that your attack is not going anyway at the moment, so you take a large point. On the debit side, maybe this move is too low. Even better might be an enclosure at P17.]
;W[od]C[TJ: Good direction by White.];B[oc]C[TJ: Be warned, some people will play the Avalanche Joseki with Q16, not that it's suitable here, but you cannot always rely on getting O17 as the reply to P17.

For your information, I have provided a couple of lines showing what might happen if White decided to play the Avalanche here.]

(;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[pe]C[TJ: Looks good in relation to R10 - the popular alternative, R14, would probably be too low.]

;B[dk];W[cj];B[ei];W[ci];B[kp]C[TJ: White has about 20 certain points on the side, but I should think the "dead weight value"FN (my term) of the Black thickness should alone balance that.

FN - By "dead weight value", I mean the number of points the thickness is likely to produce simply by virtue of its being there, without you even trying to use it in an active way. That is, even if you don't try to attack using the thickness here, it will still help you to the value of about 20 points simply because of the menacing effect it has on the opponent's movements.]

You can also play at B3, but then you have to keep a constant eye out for E2 and tactics based on it.]
