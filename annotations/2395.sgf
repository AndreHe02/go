;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc]C[you say in your comments about the game that this is a moyo game.  That's surprising to me at this point, where white plays the territorial 3-3!

It should turn out to be a battle between white's territory and black's influence.]
;B[fq];W[dn]C[This white stone should turn out awkwardly placed with the 3-3 in my opinion.]
;B[jp];W[fd]C[White is being greedy here.  If black simply plays the variation, splititng white, it will be hard for white to make good use of this move.]

(;B[qk];W[go]C[white is being even MORE greedy.  This move is pretty big, since it limits black's moyo expansion, but it's not urgent: black can still split white's aea.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq]TR[gp]C[This exchange is good for black.]
;W[ho];B[io]C[So is this one.];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[strengthening white like this may not be the best idea, but it certainly makes a big moyo.  I would simply answer with the one-space jump, hoping to get sente, as in the variation.]
;W[md];B[mc]C[I have to admit I don't know this joseki, so I'm not sure what kind of result you're trying for.

It seems odd to start a fight on the upper side, though, where you have more white stones than black ones.  Black should play more patiently and wait for white to have to invade the big moyo, so black can be the attacker.]
;W[lc];B[mb]C[It seems like black is trying to take territory and let white get outside influence, which contradicts the moyo strategy at the bottom.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[lb]C[Now white took the territory and black can get some influence so this looks good for black.]
;B[pc]C[Shouldn't black atari the single stone first?];W[nb]
;B[me];W[ld];B[ob];W[ma]C[White gets strong but black gets some VERY nice forcing moves out of this.  Black should be ahead now.]

(;TR[ok]
(;B[ci]
(;W[cg];B[cl]C[This would be LOVELY for black: white's lower corner becomes almost a weak group.]
)
(;W[ck];B[cf]TR[hc]C[White's moyo is greatly reduced.  It is sad that the upper side eliminates the future potential around the marked point though (because white's group is so strong there).  There is still some aji around the 3-3 point stone though.]
))
(;B[ok]C[This move puts a lot of "meat" into the moyo.  When you have a 3rd line stone involved in moyo building, the one-point jump is very important!]
))
(;B[im]C[J : At this point I felt black had done well on the top right and white had done well with a high position bottom left - so I though it was best to stat to "look into" the white moyo while expanding my own.

Was a deeper play more appropriate?

schwa: Yes, I think you can still split, as in the variation, since you have room for a 2-space extension both ways -- you won't come under severe attack, so your moyo won't be too much reduced.  Also, for putting "meat" into your moyo, this is not the move: your 3rd line stone needs to be expanded to the 5th line, rather than going out to the 7th line over here!  Again, see the variations, and also the variation for white's next move.]
;W[dj]TR[ok]C[This move is good for white, stopping a black splitting play, but black's moyo is open enough that the marked reducing move is still possible.]
;B[dl]TR[ce][ch][lf][ik][il][im][ji][jj][kg][kh]C[J: Ultimatley the game left this invasion ded but gave black the lower coner. So perhaps it was correct.

Given white's strentth I didn't see a good alternative. when I played this my thinknig was that  this left the best opportunuties for running away - sonethnig which was comletely incorrect.

What alternatives would you suggest

schwa: imagine what happens if both moyos convert into territory along the rough boundary line sketched out with the marks.  If black's half of the board is bigger, then white has to invade black's moyo, not the other way around!  So I would still play the one-space jump, extending from the 3rd line up to the 5th.

If you wish to invade white's moyo. note that there are 5 strong stones aiming at this invasion.  But you do have your lower side one-space jump, a very strong stone, to help it.  Still this invasion should help white get a strong hold on the upper left side area.  I would try an invasion at one of the two marked points at the top, trying to find a thin spot in the bigger part of white's moyo.  My thinking is that the marked stone on the bottom already prevents white from gaining too much in this bottom area, and white's fairly strong 5 stones prevent black from gaining much by attacking or invading, so the top part of white's moyo is where you should invade.]
;W[gl]C[This looks reasonable for white and now it feels like 7 against 1 for the poor black invasion stone.  Don't get so outnumbered unless you have to!]
;B[cj]C[Attaching like this shows you're desperate to defend ... not good.  White will build up strength to help reduce your moyo.]
;W[ci];B[ck];W[di]C[Now white looks SOLID in the whole upper left area!  This exchange has been VERY good for white.]
;B[cn]
(;W[cm]TR[ci][di]C[white attacks just a bit too hard here.  Hane the other way, let black live: white still gains a lot from the outer strength!  Look at what the marked stones do to help the upper left part of white's moyo.]
;B[bm]
(;W[dm];B[co];W[bl];B[do];W[eo]C[white has made some overplays here, and black gets away with a lot.]
;B[cp];W[ep];B[dr]C[Black was good to give up the three stones and take the big corner.  Black got lucky for white to play this way!]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[cr];W[er];B[br];W[eq];B[bn]TR[er][hq]C[Even so, black gains a few points in the corner but white's marked stone plus the atari threat take away at least as many points on the lower side, plus white's upper area has been solidified as well ... white is still gaining.]
;W[cl]C[A big move, but a bit slow.  Now black has lots more sente moves to threaten to save these three stones.]
;B[ok]TR[dj][kf][ci][di]C[J: At this stage I felt it was important to strengthen my framework and limit the reduction  white might inflict.

Is this thinking too passive?

 At the time I felt things were going well. On reflection white is still terribly strong in the top left. Is pushing in more urgent now?

schwa: this move would have been better sooner, before white's outside got so strong with the marked stones.  But this is still a huge and calm move for black.  I might try to move around the marked junction area at the top, though, since this move looks so good for white at this point.

The key mistake to recognize is that by invading where white was already strong, black has created new strength for white.  What black gained in the bottom left corner is outweighed by what white gained on the outside.]
;W[le];B[mf]
(;W[qq];B[pp]C[J: Too passive?

schwa: I would hane without even thinking about it.  As soon as you play here it's like you had a 4-4 stone instead of a 3-4 stone, so you know white will get an easy life.  And in fact if you had a 4-4 stone you might have wanted to block the other side!  So yes, I think this is too easy on white, you must hane.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qr]C[Good move by black, white should have haned on this end first before the push on top.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[qm];B[pm];W[pn];B[po];W[pl];B[om];W[ql];B[pk]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[rk];B[rj]C[White has given black a few points on the bottom, taken a few on the side here, but given black much more outside strength.  So white's push up the side was dubious.]
;W[rl];B[nk]TR[kg]C[J: I thought this was being solid. Is it simply a waste of sente?

schwa: it is strong but white still has the edge sente later, so the diagonal connection on the edge might be more points.

The real question you have to ask is not whether it's a waste of sente, it's what the score is!  If you can win by playing here, then obviously it's good to be safe, strong, and solid like this.  If you are losing, then just as obviously you don't have time to make a move like this!  You should defend it indirectly around the triangled point instead.

My count suggests white is winning if he gets the triangled point first, so you should go there instead of this move.]
;W[kg]C[...and in fact white goes there, good move by white, and black now faces a tough fight to catch up.]
;B[ii]C[j: I finally realise how big white is up there. This did not turn out weel, but is a gentle pusdh the right idea anyway?

schwa: again, the answer is not in the position's strength or weakness but rather in the overall count.  Does this reduce white enough to win?  If so, then of course it's better to be safe like this.  If not, then try something more severe/wild/crazy to try to catch up.

I think the game is close enough that this approach is reasonable.  If white just defends, black will catch up.]
;W[ik]C[So white has to counterattack like this.]
(;B[ki])
(;B[hj]C[J: I didn't think somethnig like the alternative would be enough. Is my judgement wrong?

schwa: even if you run away like the alternative, white still needs a move or two to solidify things, and meanwhile your running away helps you solidify some territory ... maybe enough.

If you don't think running away is good enough at this point, then perhaps you should have invaded more deeply to begin with.]
;W[il];B[ig]C[Looks like maybe one move too much at this point.  Run away, then threaten either to go here or to save your three stones after you are sure your invasion is not going to get killed!]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[mh]TR[ki][ne][of][qj][ri]C[white is just saying "OK, you reduce me, I can reduce you just as much".  And with the weaknesses at the marked points, he's probably right.  Still I would probably have made the hane first to attack your invasion more severely.]
;B[oh]C[You have to count which is bigger: the territory diffference of white playing here, vs the territory difference of you jumping in one more time to white's territory.  Here it looks like they're fairly close to equal, so defending like this is probably OK (given all the weak points white could aim at otherwise).]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[hg];B[gg];W[hf];B[fh]C[hm.  White's peep is so tempting now ...]
;W[gi];B[hi]C[if you connect the other way, white can't cut!]
;W[gh];B[gj];W[fi];B[fj];W[ei];B[ek]C[White gains a lot here.  Game looks over for black.]
;W[dk];B[fc]C[Good time for a desperate move.];W[gc];B[kh];W[jg]
C[J: All the following sequence fails for me. Is any such deep invasion realisitc? How better to go about it?

schwa: given how much strength white now has, it's too late to invade I would think.  Attaching on the 3-3 stone maybe has a chance.  But the real lesson is that you need to be decisive: is white's moyo bigger?  If so, deal with it early!  Split the side!  If black's moyo is bigger, then ignore white's moyo, just make yours stronger and wait till white jumps in and you get to attack!  Then you build up strength by attacking, so you get to hurt his moyo more than he hurt yours.]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[ed];W[fe];B[dc];W[cd];B[ee]C[hane on top instead (3-2 point)?]
;W[fb];B[cf]C[at least try the ko?];W[ec];B[dd];W[db]C[now black DEFINITELY has no chance to live in here.]

schwa: yes, white could have played much more simply here, no need for white to keep fighting with such a big lead.]
