C[Hi vincet to my opinion to coment a game one has to be at least 4 stones stronger than the players. I am 1k at IGS so I am not sure to be very competent. But I will try my best.]
;B[dd]C[
 vcr 4k : Have a nice game];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[co];B[bo];W[dn];B[er]LB[dm:a][cm:b][bn:c][em:d]
C[this seems a bit too low. the normal move here would be d7 (then w c7, b b6, w e7, sente for black)]
;W[cm];B[eq];W[ep];B[fp]C[this cut is not very dangerous for white because his left group is totaly safe.]
;W[gq];B[fo];W[bn]LB[ip:a]C[why? a move at j4 would punish blacks cut.]
;B[hp]C[now its white, who is under attack.];W[dq]C[one ko threat less.]
;B[dr];W[br]C[this doesn´t work];B[cr];W[fc]LB[cf:a]C[to give up the gf3 stones is a very big loss.  furthermore f17 should be at c14, this would be a natural extension from his thickness. now black c 14 devalues this thickness.]
;B[hq]C[this is big! but I dont know whether b c14 would be good, too.]
;W[qn]LB[cf:a]C[w c14 would be better for sure. because of b h3 the q4 stone is not weak. if now b c14 it would be an easy game for b.]
;B[np];W[pj];B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[hd]LB[ic:a][jc:b]C[perhaps j17 would be better, now b has an easy invasion point at k17.]
;B[nc];W[lc];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[od];B[nb];W[me];B[qh]LB[ql:a]
C[risky. I would invade at r8.];W[rp];B[oh]LB[qj:a]C[why not attaching at r10 to make a base?]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[nj];B[mh];W[lj]LB[qj:a][ri:b]C[better a or b to prevent black from making a base while building territory]
;B[kh];W[ji]LB[of:a];B[jh]LB[of:a][rj:b]C[black should force with p14 and then slide at s10.]
;W[ih];B[jf];W[ig];B[lf];W[ke];B[kf];W[if];B[je];W[kd];B[pf]
;W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[mg]LB[rj:a]C[??? its hard to see, why black dont slide into whites territory while making eyes.]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[rf];B[rj];W[rk];B[qj];W[qk];B[pi];W[pk];B[pg]
LB[li:a]C[better a (m11),];W[rc];B[rb];W[rd];B[sb];W[lp];B[lq]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[kn];B[hm]LB[kr:a]C[i would prefer a (l2)];W[ir]
;B[hr];W[in];B[hn];W[qr];B[pr]LB[kr:a]C[perhaps still better a (l2)]
;W[kr];B[mn]LB[pn:a]C[not good. better b q6.];W[no]C[now w is back in the game]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[nq];W[nn];B[pn]LB[kp:a][jp:b]C[the cut at a (l4) and then b (k4) would work, black would win the  semiai.]
;W[pm];B[qo];W[ro];B[qm];W[rn];B[om];W[nm];B[pl]LB[kp:a]C[better cut at a.]
;W[lo];B[lm]C[very bad. b has to live with his group!];W[km]
;B[ll];W[nl];B[kl];W[jl];B[kk]LB[oo:a][ns:b]C[now w can kill black with p5 or o1.]

;W[ls];B[ms];W[mr];B[lr];W[ms];B[rm];W[ol]LB[li:a]C[not necessary, its no eye anyway. w can play m11.]
;B[sm];W[sj];B[qs];W[rs]LB[rr:a]C[wrong. with s2, white can get a seki.]
;B[rr];W[sr];B[ss];W[ri];B[qi];W[rs];B[jp];W[kp];B[ss];W[li]
;B[lh];W[rs];B[ks];W[rq]C[why?? this is almost like resigning. now white has to kill the k 10-group, not an easy task, because w has a weakness: a cut at j 15.]
;B[or];W[dg];B[fg]C[its hard to find the best move here for black. I don´t know.]
;W[fh];B[eg]LB[gh:a]C[better g 12];W[fi];B[fj]LB[gk:a]C[better a (g9), whites peep was not so good.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[de];B[ce];W[dh]LB[el:a][em:b][fm:c][ci:d]C[difficult fighting. black has a and crosscut which will be helpfull for connecting the middlegroup with a move like c11.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[bi]LB[gf:a]C[now its a hard job for black to live.]
;B[gg]C[too slow.];W[he];B[fe]C[black will not get an eye there.]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[dc];B[cd];W[fd];B[el];W[em];B[dj];W[cj];B[ef]
;W[bh]LB[gf:a][bb:b]C[not necessary, just a (g14) to prevent the second eye. on the other hand, white can now kill the ul groub with b (b18)]
