C[Before I begin this review I would like to point out that what is keeping both of you from improving is simply that you both seem to be ignoring the whole board. This review will come to naught if you don't re-read what I say above a few times to realize how serious this is. You will NEVER improve until you start looking at the whole board before placing stones in a local situation.

In this game I saw many very simple examples of neglect. Ladders - These are the basics of GO once you see one when you are 35 kyu you understand that if you don't have a ladder breaker in place you simply can't play the ladder- unless you need to create a miai situation where you start a ladder, then play the ladder breaker as compensation for losing your stones. But this is another matter entirely.

In this game Black (I'm going to be hard on Black as it is my opinion that black is simply ignoring some of the fundementals of the game. I'm not saying white is also, but Black won this game not by clever playing but by gross whole board judgement by white. Black looked like was bound and determined to throw the whole game away by ignoring FUNDEMENTALS. I thought the game was over for black so many times.. I was so surprised to see that he won ;)

1) If you don't know ladders don't play Go (This is a proverb, it sounds mean but it's intention is to make you realize that you must pay attention to simple fundementals.

2) Count liberties of your units

3) Don't play aji-keshi. These are aji destroying moves. Black almost seemed in this game to make aji-keshi move after aji-keshi move

4) Look at the whole board

5) Play flexibly quit settling your position(s) so early in the game. If you settle a position to early there is no way you can react to the whole board position later on. The only way you can learn this is to quit caring if you win or lose and experiment, get reviews

6) Both of you have little or no understanding of thickness. You don't use thickness to make territory

7) You must learn what it means to say; "Leaning attack", "splitting attack"

8) Moyo's are not territory - If you play a moyo oriented fuskei and then start going for territory you are going to lose everytime.

9) Don't play so directlty. Learn to be more subtle. You may think that you can't read through the variations. But you must try or your reading strength will never improve.

10) At your strength QUIT CARING ABOUT WINNING!!! Play to learn try new things that you don't understand. Play bizarre moves, that have some basis on strategy and tactics. Then evaluate these moves at the end of the game.

11) Learn some basic joseki. Don't memorize the moves. Understand the best you can why each move is made in a joseki. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the game.  For Black I would suggest picking up the book "Power of the Star Point" Learn the joseki in this book and why they are played.

12) Both of you should pick up "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol 1, Vol 2, Vol 3, and Vol 4. 

Okay lets start the review...

Boy betcha you'll never ask this nasty guy for a review again ;)]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[fq]C[This is an odd move by white. It is so rare of a move that in over 5000 professional games in my fuseki library I could not find one reference to a opening where white played 4.

Had I been black I would have taken the last corner and sat back to see what white did.]
;B[pj]C[Black plays a sanrensei. This means that black is going to play a moyo oriented game.

The choice of whether it will be used as a fighting moyo or terratorial moyo is most often choosen by your opponent.]
;W[dd];B[cj]LB[fc:a]C[So far so good. I question Black 7 though? Why did you play this?

You must learn that in GO sente and gote are not just words but fundementals. You must learn to take and lose sente at appropriate times. Black 7 loses sente. As when white plays his next move. Which is a dual purpose move i.e it combines a pincer with an extension. Black must respond in gote. Therefore he loses sente.

I think it would have been better for black to approach at 'a'. Expanding his top right side. This is a matter of style and I think 7 is playable as it splits up the left side in compensation for losing sente. But then W gets to make the first approach move and take initiative at the top.]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[jc];B[jq]LB[mq:b][nq:a]C[It's important for both of you to realize that none of your corners can be counted as territory. How you must be looking at the board now and the questions you must ask yourself is. If my opponent invades my corner and lives (and he will live unless he makes a gross error) are my stones  placed in such a way as I can get thickness and build a moyo? If your answer is no then you probably played the wrong strategy and already your game will be difficult.

Black 11 is approaching to close to whites strong position. The Go proverb that says don't challenge strong stones to a fight is applicable here. Black should have played at 'a' or 'b']
;W[nq]C[And white of course invades ...];B[oq]C[Black 13 is good]
;W[lq];B[jo];W[lo];B[jm];W[lm];B[gp]C[Why black 19? Way to submissive. Its like you whispered into your opponents ear.. Geez I'm scared that your going to beat me up here. So I'm going to settle myself....]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[hp]C[Variation]
(;B[hr]TR[gp]C[This was real bad.. Go backl one move and see the variation... Remember before you play a move... Look at the board... Try to figure out what it is you want to do locally and globally. Then find a move that satisfies that. Don't just blindly play moves in a fight without looking at the possibilities.

Black complely ignored the ladder at marked stone.];W[ip];B[jp]
;W[go];B[fp];W[ep];B[fo];W[fn];B[gn]C[Here the game is starting to be a loss. All becuase you ignored the fundemental ladder.]

;W[ll];B[pg];W[oh];B[qg]C[Again here? You should easily see that the marked B stones are dreadfully important.,. But when you ataried here a couple moves back.. White connected. You needed to protect the cut... 

You must pay attention to where you can cut and where you can't. Where your opponent can cut and where he can't. What I'm saying here is you both often seem to protect cuts that don't need it.. and fail to protect ones that do ;)... This is just simply opening your eyes... Looking at a cut and asking yourself "What happens if my opponent cuts there? Is it a real threat? Will he gain an advantage?]
;W[nj]LB[is:a]TR[jj][jk][hk][fk][fl][gl][hl][gm][gn][jm][kn]
[io][jo][jp][jq][jr][iq][hq][hr]C[And white cuts... 

The eye at 'a'  is false as it stands or should I say  can be destroyed by W playing there. B must save the marked Black dragon..]
;B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[ol];W[mm];B[nm];W[lj]C[Game over..

I find I can teach more by doing teach games on IGS... If either of you would like one send me email.. I wonder if this review could have been better. It is so hard to review this game as the errors are in the fundementals.. I can't teach you to OPEN your EYES and look at where you can be cut and where you can't. You must learn to pay attention before you slap the stones on the board.

White could have easily killed the black dragon...

I prefer to do teach games on IGS and find they are better for me to teach. If either of you would like one.. email me RedIron@dowco.com..

(;B[go]LB[cn:b][om:a]C[White is in trouble. One move...is all it took. Black just needed to look further... now his group is settled .. It is difficult for white to extracate his stone.. Black is thick... He can attack the floating white group... by playing in the 'a' area later.,..therby strengthing his side and attacking white at the same time.. This is how one should play. Also white is open at 'b' for an invasion later when it is strategically sound for black to do so..]
