C[Hello. I've been playing this excellent game for only about 2 weeks, and I wanted to know if this is how I should be doing things. I won this game by resignation, and I wonder is it that I made the right moves, or at least good ones, or was he just not playing his Best? Please simply point out my (Or even his if you want) good moves, bad moves, etc. I'm Ben, I played White. Thank you in advance.]
;B[gc];W[cg];B[gg];W[dc];B[cc];W[dd]C[White : This moves does makes the stone stronger, but 6C is a better move as black isn't in a good position to cut. But its fine here, unless black can make u 1 straight line in the middle and even kill you(very rare, unless you are playing with strong people).]
;B[bd]C[Black: Could have gone for 6C instead.];W[ce];B[db]
;W[eb];B[ea]C[Black: If you are playing as black, I think you should know, don't ever do this. You are exposing your own weakness.]
;W[cb];B[fb];W[da];B[ec];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[gb]C[Black : As seen, it strengthens black but it was not necessary. Wasted move.]

(;W[bc]C[White: Don't think this move was necessary either, so long you force black to go to the corner and seal off its sides so it has only 1 eye.]

;B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[dh]C[White wins about 4.5 (chinese counting) at this play.

Hence, you should always try to exploit your enemy's weakness at your advantage.]
