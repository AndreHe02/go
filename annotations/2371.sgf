C[*X*: Hi, I'm Alex Weldon, 2d CGA.  My comments will be prefaced with *X* (for Xopods, my KGS username) to distinguish them from your own.

I'm not sure this was the best choice of game for review; ideally, you should pick a game you lost.  In this one, you were winning the whole time, though you made some bad moves near the end and almost let Black catch up.  There are probably some things you can learn from this game, but next time, consider choosing a game you lost, preferably one where you're not sure *why* you lost.  Those are the most educational ones.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[qj]C[I played R10 rather than Q10 to settle quickly on the right

---

*X*: This is the normal move.  Q10 is less common.];B[fq];W[ip]
C[I didn't want black to get strong on the lower side, because of my lonely stone on the right

---

*X*: R10 is not a weak stone.  R13 and R6/R7 are miai, so it doesn't need help.  However, J4 is a fine move.  I love the two-space high pincer, and there's nothing wrong with it in this position, that I can see.]
;B[cq]C[*X*: A little unusual.  Jumping out at F5 is more normal.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co]C[*X*: Weird.  D2 is normal.];W[dn]
C[*X*: Sure.  You could probably hane, though.  The stone at F3 doesn't help a cut at D6 as much as it would a cut at D5.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cm]C[*X*: So, this is almost a normal joseki, except W has pushed one more line, and B has crawled one more line.  I think that makes it a bit better for White, though it does slightly reduce the value of D16, so maybe it's okay for B.]

(;W[fp]C[*X*: This is wrong.  Too slow.  After Black has crawled one more line on the left, the aji of F3 is diminished significantly.  I think you should O4.  See variations.]
;B[jp]C[I thought black made a mistake, and I tried to take advantage of it

*X*: This move is weird, to be sure, but then again, B is contacting a strong stone, so it's not so bad.  Maybe instead of hane you should J3, though.  The continuations don't look good for B.  See variations.]

(;W[jq];B[kq]C[*X*: B's only answer.];W[qn]C[*X*: Tenuki is not good.  B can make the double hane at J5.  See variations.]

(;B[pn]C[*X*: Luckily for you, B decides to answer you locally, instead of continuing with the K4 stones.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[nq];B[oq];W[kp]C[*X*: Good.  Tsukenobi was the wrong continuation for B on the right because you get O3, which helps you here.  Still, you're lucky B gives unreasonable resistance.  He should let you take L3, and capture J4 in a ladder.  See variation.]

;W[jj];B[kk]
(;W[li]C[*X*: In the upcoming moves, you try too hard to seal Black in.   You get into amarigatachi (overwrought shape) - too many weaknesses.  Here, I think L10 is better.]
;B[ll];W[lm]C[*X*: This move only strengthens Black.  It's not good for W.]
;B[km];W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl];W[mj];B[lk]
(;W[is]C[*X*: At first, I was going to say that you didn't need this, but yes, there's a shortage of liberties if B finds the tesuji at N6.  However, there's a better way to defend against it.  N3 works too, and takes some points at the same time.  See variation.]
;B[jk];W[ij];B[hl];W[el];B[gk];W[gi]C[I wanted to build a big moyo on the upper side

*X*: Obviously, you should be protecting O10, but as you said, you didn't read it out and see that it was neccessary.]
;B[ek]C[I thought a lot to find a good move : I thought about the black corner, the left side, ...]

(;W[dk]C[*X*: Again, you're trying too hard to stop B from connecting.  If you want to build a moyo, it's more important to keep him out of the left side!  See variation.]
;B[ej];W[cn];B[nj]C[I didn't read it ...]
(;W[ok]C[*X*: Bad bad bad.  Once he cuts you should read it out and let him capture the one stone...]
;B[pk];W[oj];B[pj];W[qk];B[oi]C[*X*: Ugh, that was so bad for W!]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[qh];B[dj];W[ck];B[cf]C[I think black should approch from the other side

*X*: I agree.  Or just take the last big point at K16.  THis is small.]
;W[lc]C[*X*: The B shimari is strong.  Don't play near it.  Something like G17 is better.]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[kh];W[hd]C[I was very happy of that

*X*: Yes, B is playing small moves.  If you can get big territory on top, it's okay to let B capture the six stones in the middle.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[*X*: Okay.  You could also E15 and let B take the corner.  See variation.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[ec]C[I'm not sure it was good for white

*X*: Very bad.  Don't touch weak stones.  Just connect at E16.  Think about reversing the move order.  If you connected at E16, and B played F16, would you answer at E17?  Didn't think so.]
;B[jc]C[*X*: Good timing for B... now you see why M17 is too close to the shimari.  Too bad B throws everything away a few moves later.]

(;W[hc]C[*X* I don't like this.  B should L16 now and has a chance to come back in the game if he can capture M17.]
;B[lj]C[I don't know why black insist playing in the center

*X*: Neither do I.  As I said, B should L16 and things get tough for W.]
;W[kd]C[*X*: Good.  After H17, you can attack strongly like this, but B still has a chance!  You'll see what I mean in a few moves...]
;B[jd];W[je];B[ie];W[id];B[ke];W[jf]
(;B[lb]C[*X*: Very wrong.  B must L16 first.  See variation.]
;W[kc]C[*X*: Good refutation!  B has nothing now.];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[eb];W[dc];B[db];W[bc];B[cb];W[be]
(;B[bf]C[*X*: Horrible!  B must give up these stones and try to live in the corner, or the game is really over... but I don't think he can.  See variation for how W kills.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[dh];B[ci];W[gb]C[*X*: As I said, B can't actually live, so W doesn't need this.  But still, you've got the game already, so I guess it makes sense to remove any chance of making a mistake later.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[fb]C[it was not very brave of me. I should have played J14 or something like that

*X*: Yeah.  Seal them in, and they're dead.  Connecting one eyeless group to another eyeless group is not going to do B any good.]
;B[hg];W[jg];B[hi];W[hj];B[gh];W[hf];B[ig];W[if];B[jh]C[*X*: Now B has swallowed up your middle stones in compensation.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[qr];W[rf]C[*X*: This is very big.  Probably bigger than the lower left, so B should have ignored P1 to play here himself.]
;B[mb]C[*X*: Bad, L18 is bigger, and sente, since after W K18, N17 is atari.]
;W[kb];B[pf];W[le];B[lh];W[sc]C[*X*: Monkey jumping from a stone that isn't solidly connected is usually not a good idea.  Here, there are *many* variations, and it's easy for B to go wrong, but I think that with correct play by B, there's no way W can avoid suffering a loss.  See the variation for one possible line that ends with W losing the monkey jump stone, in sente.  That's the best result I can find for W, assuming B makes no mistakes.  It's easy for either player to go wrong though.]

*X*: Yes. S3 would save your stones.  B should have just S2 originally and forced you to defend R7 in gote.  But since you made a mistake, B gets more than he should.  You're lucky you still had enough of a lead to win.]

Unfortunately, I can't really offer much general advice.  This game was mostly fighting, and you were winning the whole time, so it doesn't give me a chance to point out the weaknesses in your style.  Play more calmly, don't try to take too much, don't play too close to your opponent's stones.  That's all I can say.]
