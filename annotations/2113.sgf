C[Hello.

I kindly request a review for black. The game was won by white by resign. I was seven points behind in the end game and didn't see any possibility to catch up with that. It's a rather close game, but I feel I've could have done better.

So any remarks are welcome...

Thanks in advance,
Florreke

Fl];B[pd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 4k in my country ranking list. I hope you'll find my comments useful.]
;W[qd]C[dede: This move is mistake for 2 reasons. It's not good to start immediate fights. Game can easily become unpredictible. Second reason is that White directly attaches, so in the fight he is one liberty behind.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[pc];W[re];B[rf];W[qf];B[pe]C[Up till here everything looks like normal joseki. But white plays different now ( W s16 instead of s13),
so it confuses me a bit..];W[rd];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
;W[fq]C[white f3 breaks the ladder from r14. So better to play q14 here for black ?
I also had a bit trouble how to decide where to play next if not q14.

dede: You should definitely capture with q14. The strong wall would be very helpful. Now Black can play in one of free corners and easily build]

(;B[dd]C[dede: big mistake. Now White's corner group is again working for him.]

(;B[oi]C[dede: Check the possibility of second hane here. Look variant for example]
;W[lg]
(;B[ql]C[dede: this is too shy. It's obvious that White will enter corner now. Instead of this, you should play there.]
;W[qp];B[nq];W[pq];B[kq];W[iq];B[cn]C[I played c6, but I was not sure about that. After white c3 I end up in gote..

dede: c4];W[cq];B[ck];W[cf]C[dede: Now c12 works as hasami and an extension from c9. Alwaus try to make moves with more than one meaning.]
;B[ce];W[ci];B[fd]C[dede: this is not joseki position. White c14 and c11 stones are weak and you shoud immediately put them under pressure. You can't build terrain while defending stones. White has 2 weak groups. You can only gain attacking them.]
;W[ic]C[dede: This is  too aggresive];B[jd]C[Didn't see a better move than k16. Not really happy with it..

dede: It's ok];W[hd];B[jf]C[k14 was meant to separate the two white groups, but in the end both white groups live... Maybe j15 had been better, I don't know
