C[MW: This is my game from the first round of this year's Cambridge go tournament, or rather, as much of it as I could remember afterwards.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[oc];W[pp];B[cp]LB[dp:a][eq:b][ep:c]C[SGF: there is absolutely nothing wrong with this move but I would be inclined to play either A, B or C to prevent a kakari at C]
;W[ep]
(;B[cn]LB[dn:a]C[SGF: I don't like this, even though it is in the joseki books.  It has the feeling of answering a kikashi.  There is nothing wrong with the variation at A]
;W[jp];B[eq]C[SGF: This reverts to the standard joseki but it cannot be denied that B has made it too easy on W.  First of all, W gets a nice shape here.  Second, B game W the option to do better than W8.  All-in-all, nothing has been gained by playing 7 before 9]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[fp];B[qj];W[qm]LB[ql:a][qn:b]C[SGF: This seems a bit like a compromise move.  A would have more effect on black but at the risk of leaving a weakness and B would strength the corner more.  This move seems sort of in between.  I would expect black to try to take advantage of this later.]
;B[jc]LB[jd:a]C[SGF: Black is very low all roudn the board. A look more appealing, both for balance and to count the high W position at the bottom.]
;W[je]LB[oe:a]C[MK:  What are the options to answer this move?

SGF: It is this response which makes B15 bad. Keima on neither side is very appealing.  If black plays towards the UL then W can come in at A, but if black plays towards to UR it does not solidy his position that much.]

(;B[ld]LB[oe:a][cf:b]C[MW: Is this too slow an answer?

SGF:  I don't like it.  White can still play A later so black in not gettign enough.  I think that playing A directly i better than this, but the variation at B is more interesting I.]
;W[qh]LB[ql:a][rd:b][pk:c]C[SGF: This is not needed.  Because W14 is not at A (see earlier comment) this stone does not relate well to W14.  B is an interesting idea at this point to see how black responds. Depending on B's response to that then building up a moyo with C might work.]

(;B[oj]C[SGF: seems timid.];W[oh];B[mj];W[mh];B[kj];W[rd]LB[rc:a]
C[MW: I wanted to separate White, but I didn't get to do this. Would S15 be better?

SGF:  You are not going to separate W and keep the corner so you have a choice. If B just takes the territory at the top in sente then he can be fairly happy with the exchange.  Separating W in exchange for corner territory is not guaranteed to return enough..  Given the B has the 4 stones bearing down on the W moyo below I would try to take the corner in sente without letting W get too good a shape. So .... try A]

(;B[qe];W[re];B[rc];W[qf]C[SGF:  Too easy for W compared to playing 27 directly]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[rf];W[kh];B[ij]C[SGF: Too late.  W has stabilized himself for the time being with the sequence from 24 to 30.  THat makes this only a defensive move.  Having said that, it is probably necessary, but it hurts to have to play it.]
;W[md]C[MW:  I thought it would be too passive to just hane underneath - is that right?

SGF:  Only reason not to hane would be if you thought you could kill the W group.  Giving up the territory at the top is big.  I do not think there is much chance of a kill here so the defense is best.]
;B[le];W[me];B[lf];W[od]
(;B[pc]LB[oe:a]C[MW:  After this move, it seems things will go badly for me. Is there another option, or was M14 bad?

SGF:  B35 was the bad move.  Having played that it is hard not to play 37.  I came up with one variation at A but only followed through one line.  It is worth looking at and may give you some ideas for further analysis.  No sure if it is actually good because there are too many things to read out.]
;W[nc];B[mf];W[lc];B[of];W[qg]
(;B[sd]LB[kc:a]C[SGF: Check the variation starting at A];W[kc]
C[SGF: This is too big to permit.  I think I would have played B45 here.  After all, if  W captures the two B stones on the edge it is still only one eye (although he can easily get a second he still has to do it, which is worth something to B).]

(;B[jd]C[SGF: Questionable.  Every liberty is important. Look at the variation at A]
;W[kd];B[ke]C[SGF:  The ice is getting very think for B.  He needs to step very carefully.]
;W[ie];B[hc];W[nf];B[ng];W[ne];B[nh]LB[og:a]C[SGF: A is much better]
;W[og];B[mg];W[ni];B[mi];W[lh];B[oi];W[kf];B[nj];W[pf]C[SGF: B has been completeyl outplayed.  It all started with B45]
;B[gd]LB[lg:a][fc:b]C[SGF: Presumably B is aiming at the W stones but given that A is sente W shou.d be able to make shape.  Because of this I would also consider B]
;W[hh];B[pe]C[SGF: What is the point of this?];W[oe];B[fe]LB[cf:a]
C[SGF: I judge B to be behind so I think this is a little slow.  I would hope that these stones can take care of themselve if need be and play at A.  I acknowledge, though, that there is a risk involved.]
;W[cf]C[SGF: and this is the reason I would have played there myself with B69]

(;B[fg]LB[lg:a][jg:b][db:c]C[SGF: not really very helpful.  If W plays A followed by B he is pretty much alive and this B play ends up as dame.  I would slide to C. See the variation.]
;W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[dg];W[lg];B[ni];W[jg];B[ig];W[hg]C[MW:  I thought J12 would have been better for White.

SGF:  I agree];B[ih];W[if];B[jh];W[gf];B[ff];W[hd];B[id];W[he]
;B[fc];W[jb];B[ic];W[eh];B[df];W[ce];B[dh];W[gk]C[];B[il]LB[bg:a]
[db:b][dk:c][ki:d][li:e]C[MW:  I was too afraid for my big eyeless group to attack around G7.

SGF:  Attacking at G7 is not likely to produce much.  Ba, Wb, Bc looks more promising.  The big B groups should be able to look after itself because both D and E are sente]
;W[gm];B[db];W[cb]LB[cc:a][bh:b]C[SGF:  I prefer Wa followed by sliding at B]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[bb];W[eb];B[ca];W[ec];B[bg]C[SGF: W can live but is risking a lot]
;W[gb]LB[fa:a][da:b][ga:c]C[SGF:  Threaten a ko with Wa, Bb, Wc seems safer.]
;B[hb]C[MW:  G17 would have been better?

SGF:  It does let W connect out with ko so probably not.];W[bd]

SGF:  yes - costly];W[ab];B[db];W[ed];B[fd];W[cb];B[ej]LB[gj:a]
C[SGF: Not big enough.  W would have to answer A];W[aa];B[gj]
LB[fj:a]C[SGF:  If  B129 were played first, B would not now play at 127 -- he would play A -- which shows that 127 was wrong]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[fj];B[fk];W[gi];B[gl];W[fl];B[gj];W[ji];B[fi]
LB[mb:a][nd:b]C[MW: I thought the thickness I would gain here would be enough to give me the game, but there were more weaknesses in the top-middle group and on the left than I'd realised.

SGF: You have one potential threat at A.  (For W to let the eye at B go would be too much) but you are still likely to lose this ko.  All-in-all, you have little choice here.]
;W[ii];B[nq]C[WM:  Should I invade like this? Or would another move to strengthen the centre be better? Is it possible for Black to attack White's bottom-left group?

SGF:  You have not time to strengthn the center.  Anyway, there really isn't a whole lot W can do right now.  Maybe there is later if you are not careful, but for now I see nothing better than invading.  You are not going to do anything with the LL white group unless W makes a mistake.  Discounting the W moyo B has a clear territorial lead so he should be ok]
;W[pq];B[no]LB[pn:a][po:b][mo:c]C[SGF:  A bit slow. but fairly safe.  The question is, whether W can get enough territory out of this to win.  I suspect the answer is yes.  i would at least play kikashi with A and B first and then maybe paly C instead of 143]
;W[om];B[pn]C[MW:  Supposed to be a probe.

SGF: too late];W[qn];B[lo]LB[dl:a][fn:b][em:c]C[WM:  Nothing _too_ eventful happened after this; in the end, W won by 1 point.

WM:  Suppose Black gets to play a move to try to turn the whole left-hand-side into territory. Where would be the best point?

SGF: depends on how much you need to win.  A is the obvious choice if it is enough.   If you need to be more agressive you can try B but that is risking a lot. C is a compromise.

At this stage of the game the territory is fairly even and the winner will be determined by the fight which is in progress.  If  W gets sente to invade the left then it will be tough for B.

I think B missed more opportunities in the game than did W and he probably should have won.]

;B[cc];W[ee];B[ic];W[ge]C[SGF:  This seems better for B given than W is not going to die in the middle.  Taking the corner in sente is very big.]

(;B[kd];W[jd];B[kb];W[jb];B[ic];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[jf]C[SGF: B has given up the top in excahnge for an attack on the side W group.  Whether this sort of strategy will work depends on the players.]

(;B[rc];W[qe];B[pd];W[kh];B[ij];W[ih];B[nq]C[SGF: Something like this looks playable.  White has got very little for his invasion because, after the W16, B17 exchange B was not going to get a huge territory at the top anyway.]

(;B[cf]C[SGF: By ignoring W16 for the time being B17 sees how W responds.  Then black can decide how to answer W16]
;W[fc];B[dj]LB[di:a]C[SGF: If W18 then B19 or A is good enough.  Now W16 looks out of place.]
))
(;B[dn];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[bo];W[iq];B[qj]C[SGF: This seems very reasonable to me. W started with two hoshi points and so this position does not really utilize them very well.  B has other options for 13 but this gives the general idea.]
