C[Dear Jaxarle,
my name is Greogr, I'm 17k on KGS and doing my first review. I'm at the beginning of go too, so take my hints as suggestions, not as truth :)
I will start every comment with "Gregor:" and refer to the moves with "bn" or "wm" for the nth move of black and the mth move of white.
Thank you for allowing me to review your game!

Dear Reviewer,

My name is Jaxarle and I am requesting a review of Black's play. White's moves really confused me in this game, attacking very closely, which I thought was bad, but had no idea how to deal with them. Any advice on this would be extremely helpful. Also, any advice on breaking out into the centre would be of great assistance, as I've had a lot of trouble doing so in many recent games.

Thankyou for your time,

-Jaxarle.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[qj];B[jp]C[Gregor: The lower rigt corner looks very good for b!]
;W[jq]C[Gregor: I don't know if w8 k3 is really good for w. In the books it says: keep distance to attack, touch to defend. As w I would have made a base and an atack with w8 at r14 or q14 or taken another big point as  w8 c10 or k17.

Now to b9: Perhaps m3 may be reasonable but defensive answer, but b9 f3 seems also possible. (see variants)
Recently I read that in fighting 1 w  against 1 b just to eliminate liberties as b did with b9 at l3 is very good!]

(;B[kq]C[J: I had thought that this was a relatively safe move, that W would back off to J3..]
;W[kp]C[Gregor: a cross cut  - see the discussion on sensei's library http://senseis.xmp.net/?Crosscut.
It's not bad at all! It leads to fighting!
The usual follow up is extension, not atari. (see variants)]

(;B[iq]C[J: I decided to aim at the bottom stone to secure this area.]
;W[jr];B[lp];W[ko];B[lq];W[ip];B[ck]C[J: Aiming at either C6 or C12, and an maybe an eventual ladder breaker to reclaim the bottom.

Gregor: seems to me a good idea!];W[cl]C[J: W's attacks really confused me in this game. I've been taught not to attack so closely, which leaves me at rather a loss for what to do when the opponent plays this way. Was strengthening this stone then extending the right thing to do? Or should I have attacked C8?

Gregor: I understand your irritation. Perhaps w loves fighting and complicated situation. You should remeber (I'm citing from the books): if w plays too aggressive, she may end up with a lot of weak groups. So attacking with b19 at d8 may be a good idea - as just before in the lower middle of the bord! see variants]

(;B[dk];W[dl];B[dg]C[Gregor: perhaps better on the 3rd line.]
;W[cf]C[Gregor: building a wall looks a litle bit slow. Perhaps b23 e14 or f14 or e15 is possible. see variants.]

(;B[cg];W[bf];B[bg]C[J: In hindsight this seems a pretty appalling attempt at creating a group.. was there a better way to have played in this sequence? I was mainly going for life for the group, and then maybe a path into the centre afterwards.]

(;B[io]C[Gregor: Maybe it's better here to give up the two stones k45 and attack the corner. But I don't really know - ist confusing for me too. see variants]

(;B[fc]C[J: The group on the left suddenly seemed dead already.. was I wrong? Could it have been saved? I've had similar groups attacked and killed before. Instead of trying to save it against the wall, I thought to attack the top corner, and perhaps connect down later.
Gregor: Im not sure, if the group is really dead. it may be possible to run out with a move around f13. see variants]
;W[gc]C[J: Again, the close attacks that I couldn't think of a way to counter.
Gregor: Perhaps a pincerattac at m17 or h17, j17 would be better. see variants.]

(;B[fe];W[ef];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[bb]C[J: Should this have been B16? I was hoping to reconnect to the stones at F15/17, but I guess that was already impossible.]

J: Thank you once again for reviewing this game, and for any light you may be able to shed on my confusion.

Gregor: Thank you again for letting me review your game.  I learned a lot in doing it. I hope, my comments are somehow helfpul. Allow me so say in general: don't be afraid, if your opponent makes unusual moves. Perhaps they are genious, perhaps they are very risky for her/him!
Good luck, Jaxarle!])
