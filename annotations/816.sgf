C[Hi,

After playing a number of quick, casual games this  is the first serious game I've had in a while.  The  game felt close to me all the way through, with me  (white) slightly behind.  I think I also made some  yose errors.

Since my opponent was only 7k* that presumably  means we both made about an equal number of  mistakes and I'd appreciate some ideas about  which mistakes I made (or mistakes they made that  I missed).

MW: Hi, I'm Martijn Wallage. I'm a Dutch first kyu. I  hope you learn something from my comments.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cj]C[All very standard so far.  C10 isn't a move I  particularly like as B, but that is probably just my  personal taste.

At this point I thought I'd try a kakari (sp?) around  P17 and hope for Q14, K16 or so.

MW: C10 is a move that prevents white from  making a moyo.   A kakari around P17 is indeed the biggest move for  white.]
;W[oc];B[jc]C[I hesitated here since M17 seemed to give me  comfortable space and B's advance onto D16 leads  to me pressuring c10, b pressuring D4 and then I  thought I could take sente and split B's two groups  at F15 or wherever, depending on the moves.
I wasn't sure about leaving d4.];W[lc]C[MW: This is ok.];B[gc]
C[I'd expected F17, but decided this move didn't change how I would respond, it seemed important to give d16 breathing space.]

(;W[cg]C[MW: This is ok. I've added another possible way of  playing that I like more myself.]
;B[cm]
(;W[jp]C[I wasn't sure about K4.  I felt C7 was too weak to  demand I played close while at the same time I  didn't really want to leave it entirely, especially  since with G17 there were no good splitting moves

MW: I don't like K4. It doesn't really help the stone  on D4. And I think you should help that stone now.]
;B[lq]C[I considered K3 but decided Q10 would be too  valuable to B and I had to do something about it.

MW: I find this a very difficult position. I think  defending at F3 is really big. But I agree white will  then fall behind. Playing at R6 is a more positive  idea.]

(;W[pj]C[MW: It quite surely prevents black from playing  there.  But it doesn't do much else.
By the way, if you're going to play there, it would be  better on the third line. Because territory and a  base are worth more than influence in this game.  Since there is no moyo in this game.]

(;B[qg]C[MW: Black made a weak move here. He wasn't  under that much pressure.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn]C[I was pretty happy with that, I get gote but I'm fairly  settled. I worried a little about B G3 but I decided K4  was on the fourth line so not about to get trapped.

MW: As you see now, you would prefer to have Q10  at R10. But you're right aboot 17-18 exchange  being good for white. And you're also right about K4  being a light stone about which you don't have to  worry much.
You didn't really get gote. Locally, the proper move  for black now would be O4. At some time in the  game he will have to play there.]
;B[np]C[MW: Well, isn't that a nice proper move black made  there? I'm sure his mother will be proud.]
;W[jn]C[MW: And you just said you just worried a little  about K4, this is a little too much. This move seems  to run out into the center with K4. But that's really  strange with so much room around. Defending the  corner at F3 or some such move is much better.]
;B[mn]C[I spent a couple minutes over this next move.  It  seems the fuseki is over and we're into the  midgame, with no particularly obvious targets to  attack.  I considered E6, g3, E13, e18, L15 and P13  mainly.  I decided the goal was to extend my  groups in a way that threatens to connect them  since that would allow me to put pressure on the  relativly strong B groups.  I was also aware I had  very little settled territory.

MW: Let me give you a somewhat more general  word of advice: Play real moves. Moves that really  do something. Most of the moves you were thinking  about all do a lot of things a little bit. (and in this  case, a little bit doesn't go a long way).
E6 builds some influence and puts a little pressure  on the two black stones. But the influence isn't  worth much since it won't make any territory  because white is open at the bottom. So black can  slide in there.
G3 is a move I like. It defends the corner.
E13 gives a little strength and a little influence. So  forget about it. The best move in that area would  be E17. That really makes territory and it puts some   real pressure on the two black stones.
The lower left seems most urgent to me though.];W[og]C[MW: Since there isn't a moyo this move really  doesn't do that much. White still doesn't have any  territory.]
;B[pg]C[This seemed ok to me, the key question is if I go to  P14 or P12.  I decided to pull back since a cut at  P12 might kill Q6 if I have to jump Q10 out.

MW: Well, it doesn't seem ok to me. It attaches  imortance to a not so important stone. Black should  at least first slide in at D18 and then play  somewhere in the lower left. Both players shouldn't  be bothered by this area at all.]
;W[oh];B[of];W[nf];B[oe];W[ne];B[od]C[it was a pity to lose a good R18 invasion, and this  wall isn't going to be especially useful, so I guess  this line of play is non optimal?

MW: Both players didn't play well here. White  could have at least  exchanged R17 for S17 and Q16 for R14  somewhere. Or else black could have exchanged  Q17 for P16.
Still it's good for white. Because black maybe made  about 10 points of real territory but that's not such a  big improvement over the territory he was going to  get there anyway. White has a magnificient thick  wall which he can always use very well to put  pressure on black.]
;W[nd];B[pc];W[ob];B[qj]
(;W[qi];B[ri]C[I wondered about this for a while and eventually decided that if I captured s11 then B could split at Q11 but S10 would connect to R6 so it was probably the best line of play.]
;W[rj]
(;B[pi]C[I didn't expect this, but I decided a ponnuki couldn't  be bad.

MW: And you're very right indeed. That's the worse  that could happen to black.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[oi]C[I considered Q12 instead but then b would just use  escaping as a ko threat.  I was hoping to leave this  unresolved with me winning the ko, and eventually  to play P9 or similar once moves got small enough  for b to restart the ko.

MW: If you think the ko is important then you should   connect cause you can't win it.]
;B[qj];W[eb]C[I picked this since it settled territory and was sente  against G17.

MW: You can't win the ko, so don't try to.  Connecting at P9 is urgent.]
;B[fb]C[At this point I wondered if I should have played D18  instead since this isn't a position I particularly  wanted to leave

MW: locally you want E17.];W[qi];B[ph];W[ec]C[MW: It's endgame. White should defend the lower  left.]
;B[qj]C[MW: This is a severe danger to the white group on  the right side.]
;W[jd]C[MW:  Three proverbs:
1. Don't use thickness to make territory.  2. Don't attach to weak stones.
3. Urgent moves before big moves.

You have to defend the group on the right (and in  the lower left, but you can't do everything)]
;B[id];W[je];B[kc];W[ld];B[ie]C[seems b is alive and I don't particularly want to  take the ko or connect at P10, so not a very good  result.

MW: You might not want to. But you really have to.  you're right about It not being a good result.]
;W[jf];B[ge]C[MW: whooo, I think not even his mother will like  this.  Ok, he passes.  Are there any dame points that need to be filled  somewhere?]
;W[ml]C[this was my idea of a loose connection at P10, and  threatening to make a nontrivial territory in the  middle. Not exactly honte I suppose.

MW: If black can win the ko white is in trouble.];B[nm];W[nl]
;B[om];W[pl]C[MW: He's really nice for a dragon. I think he's a  sweet dragon :).]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[ol];W[ok];B[km];W[mm]C[I thought this was sente

MW: It threatens to cut and if black defends then  white can somewhere in the game take the four  black stones. So that's a very good move.]
;B[ln];W[kk]C[MW: A lot of territry. But your really not allowed to  make territory with thickness :).  Didn't it seem strange to you that while so many  moves have been played at the right side of the  board, not you nor your opponent did something  with the three white stones in the lower left?]
;B[jm];W[en]C[MW: As I said, this move doesn't do something  real.]
;B[jk]C[I think that went well for black

MW: I think so too.];W[kj];B[jr];W[hq];B[iq];W[ip];B[hr];W[gq]
;B[gr];W[eq];B[fq];W[fp];B[fr];W[hn]C[MW: So you end up with very little territory. This is   what you'll get when you don't play real moves.]
;B[bp];W[bq]C[whereas this went terribly for me, I misread C5 as preventing the E2 cut]
;B[cq];W[br];B[cp];W[dr];B[do];W[eo];B[dq];W[ep];B[er];W[co]
;B[bo]C[there is where I misread];W[dn];B[cn];W[eg]C[this seemed big, I'm not sure where I should have  played.  I decided it was bigger than O6

MW: I think it's worth about half of O6.
R18 is much bigger though.];B[hg]C[MW: ok, he passes again.]
;W[nn];B[no];W[oo];B[op]C[MW: wow, you got it in sente.];W[jj]
C[MW: Not so big.];B[ih];W[jh];B[im];W[jq];B[ir];W[lp];B[mp]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[lo];B[mo];W[ik]C[MW: All this time R18 has been the biggest move  for white. And Q18 is the biggest move for black.]
;B[in];W[ho];B[io];W[hm];B[il];W[hl];B[hk];W[jl];B[gk];W[ek]
;B[fl];W[el];B[fm];W[dl];B[cl];W[hj];B[gj];W[ei]C[that wasn't quite as successful as I had hoped]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[fh];W[fi];B[gi];W[eh];B[fg]C[I'm guessing b is slightly in front now.  52 points in  the bottom group and 25 elsewhere while w has 37  in the middle, 5.5 komi and 20 in the upper right, so  about 12 pts difference with w to play

MW: I think it's a bit late to go counting.]

C[MW: finally.];B[pb];W[pa];B[qc];W[rb];B[rc];W[sb]C[I wanted to go the last step even though it was  small because of the eye at T19

MW: Well, it's worth some points but it is gote and  not reversed sente er anything. M18 is sente.]

;W[rh];B[sh];W[si];B[nc];W[rg]C[I made the wrong call here, I read out b answering S11 and w using either Q or R14 to trap Q13.]

;B[da];W[ca];B[fa];W[sp];B[rq];W[sq];B[sr];W[so];B[rr]C[from now on the yose went badly for me. Perhaps I  should have taken a reverse sente move here

MW: Well, I can hardly imagine someone screwing  up a game at this stage.

I have to correct myself here. I just replayed a  game between Ryu Shikun 7p and O Rissei 9p for  the 26th Kisei Title. And in that game Ryu Shikun  overlookes an atari when filling up the dame-  points.]
