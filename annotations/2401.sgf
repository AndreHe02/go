C[Hello Reviewer, my name is Johan Meijerink, I played this game on KGS, and I have honestly no idea what my current strength is. Before this game I beat a 1d, and 2d. So I would like some help from you to give me a clue about my own rank, and what my strong-and-weak points are in this game. I played as white against a 3d, komi is 6.5.
I hope that you'll be able to give me a nice understandable review, and also enjoy doing so. :)

[EV\] Hello Johan, this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked [EV\].  This was an interesting game, and I hope I can give you some useful pointers.  It is hard to estimate someone's rank from one game, so just keep playing and let KGS sort it out.]

;B[mp]C[The opening so far, I chose this formation because I hate it when someone plays a shimari against me. Is it good enough for white to begin with, or is there something better?

[EV\] This could be a professional game so far.  R8 could also be R9, and N4 could also be O4, both are joseki.  B could also switch N4 to something like C14 for a faster opening.  Just a matter of personal style.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de]
(;B[bf]C[this was kind of unexpected, I expected him to play E13, because now I could cut there... though something was telling me not to cut inmediately so I chose to extend with F17 first.

[EV\] Both E13 and B14 are joseki.  E13 emphasizes the center, while B14 goes for more profit.  When B plays B14 it is normal to cut immediately.  See the variations for the next few moves in either case.]

(;W[fc]C[[EV\] This move is slightly too conservative -- the joseki starting with D14 should be followed up on a larger scale.]
;B[be];W[eg]C[so here's the cut.. B15 seemed very slow to me

[EV\] Once F17 is played, the value of B15 is much reduced, since the normal W answer at C17 would be too small.  Exercise for the reader: can W later block at B16, or does this leave too much aji in the corner?  

[EV\]  This cut still seems reasonable, but it was more severe before the F17-B15 exchange.  I would consider leaving this corner alone for now, in order to make an approach move somewhere in the lower left.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[gi]C[I think this move of mine was a bit too passive, maybe better to cut at D11, and then extend to C11, to create some aji there?

[EV\] Once a pushing fight like this starts, you have to keep going.  The question is whose moyo is growing fastest?

[EV\] Taking time out to cut at D11 does not work.  B has a ladder at F13 which would end the game :)]
;B[ej];W[ne]C[trying to start making a moyo with that move, maybe too soon

[EV\] B can now push at G10 and keep pushing forever.  W has too few liberties to do anything but keep extending.  B can also jump to H10 to get ahead in the pushing fight, since a W cut would be unreasonable.  In either case, B gets a really large moyo, but the W moyo is more secure.  Hard to decide who gains more, so I think your move is playable.

[EV\] B could also try H11, which looks interesting here.  See the variation, which looks promising for B.

[EV\] As W I guess I would  continue the center struggle at G10.  But I think your move is  possible.  Switching to the lower left also seems possible.]

(;B[hh]C[this move set me to think for a while.. couldn't think of anything better than to defend]
;W[gg]C[[EV\] What if B cuts at F12 now?  The resulting fight looks good for B, with forcing moves like H13 which reduce the W moyo and strengthen the B cutting stones.]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[he];W[gj]C[[EV\] Yes, it looks like W has to run out now.  At first I thought H17 was good enough for W, but then the B enclosure at H10 looks too good.]
;B[gc];W[hc]C[[EV\] This sort of contact move usually ends up strengthening both sides, which W does not want here.  I would just answer at F16 to keep E14 safely captured and let B struggle.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[je];W[dk]C[after seeing the move on H12 from black, I tried a sort-like move playing D9

[EV\] Looks unreasonable to me.  B is strong here, and I don't think W can take time out from the ongoing fight to risk creating another weak group.  Even after B answers defensively, I don't see that W has gained anything.]
;B[ci];W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[jh];W[kg]C[[EV\] The last two pushes in sente were fine, but this move presses the attack too hard.  This seems like a good time to consolidate the W position on the other side, which is getting thin.  How about  F16 instead?  This move captures the E14 cutting stone and also makes territory by ensuring the connection under G18.]
;B[dc]C[[EV\] B finds an interesting invasion point.  But even the simple cut at F15, creating threats on both sides, would be difficult for W to deal with.]
;W[cc];B[ed];W[ec];B[db];W[cb];B[ee];W[cd];B[fg];W[fh];B[fd]
;W[gb];B[gd];W[eb];B[gf]C[[EV\] This result is too good for B.  The weak floating W group in the center will cost more than the territory W made on top.  At this point I think B has a won game.]
;W[fk]C[this move.. I think it was a too hastful decision.. might be better to extend with G9 or something else?

[EV\] Yes, G9 is better, or possibly J11.  W cannot afford to get cut here.  With no weak B groups to play against, something should die.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[ii]C[[EV\] Good, makes the best out of a bad situation and creates some complications for B.  In the continuation, this time B pushes the attack too hard.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ij];W[hl];B[hm]C[[EV\] The sequence B chooses here is tempting, but leaves too many weaknesses behind when W fails to die.  G7 looks like a safe way to keep the lead, making territory while attacking safely.]
;W[gm];B[fl];W[fm];B[el];W[jj];B[il];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[kh]
C[[EV\] The B attack has fizzled badly.  Now the B moyo is gone, the top B group is no longer alive, and W gets a strong counter-attack.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[cj];B[di];W[en];B[cl]C[[EV\] The continuation from here is difficult.  W can cut at D8 and live on the side, or use any number of forcing moves like D5 to take part of the B corner, or invade the corner directly, perhaps at C4.  There is so much aji here that B cannot defend everything even with an extra move, so W could also just settle the center group immediately with K8.]
;W[cm];B[fn];W[gn];B[dn];W[fo];B[dl]LB[io:A][cp:C][cq:B][dq:D]
C[[EV\] W is now clearly leading.  A move around A would settle the W stones and keep the B center weak.  Once W is settled, the B corner can be invaded at any of the points B or C or D.]
;W[do];B[co];W[eo]
(;B[cn]C[I think this was a good result for white

[EV\] B should connect at C4 instead of C6, to strengthen the corner.  Then W gains nothing from the last few moves -- see the alternate sequence.]
;W[jm];B[eq];W[jg];B[ih];W[kk];B[kd]C[seemed like an overplay to me so decided to put some pressure on his group before defending the upper side

[EV\] W should have an easy win from here, so not too many more comments.]
;W[if];B[ie];W[ig];B[hf];W[mg];B[lh];W[mf];B[kj];W[jl];B[lj]
;W[mi]LB[qc:B][qh:A]C[[EV\] Sorry, I can't resist.  Why attack so hard when you don't need to kill?  The next few attacking moves don't make any territory unless B dies, which is unlikely.  Switch to A or B instead.  These moves make territory and prepare a stronger attack later.]
;B[mk];W[nl];B[nk];W[oi];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[fq]C[I think that I had to make that move.. before black would get the chance to play there and get even more territory..]
;B[pb]C[black responded with Q18.. I don't think it is just as big, but ok]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[lq];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr]
;W[ir];B[jo];W[ip];B[mq];W[kn]LB[ok:A][er:C][kr:B]C[is this result good enough for white? or could I have done more? or black for that matter.

[EV\] A and B and C all seem bigger than the last move, since B cannot rescue H7.  Looks like W still has a safe lead in any case.  This is my last comment.]
;B[nn];W[on];B[pl];W[pm];B[ok];W[qk];B[om];W[no];B[mn];W[qh]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[ob];W[mb]C[this was a stupid move from my side.. came to my mind after I played it.. black could play M18, and I was in big trouble.]
;B[of]C[instead he chose this move.. perhaps trying to capture the whole L14 group thanks to the error I made on N18, or creating eye space.. hmm]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[se];W[sg];B[rd];W[er]C[in the game I thought he would respond to this move, just a feeling I had, and luckily enough he did so.. still leaving the weak point at M18 though]
;B[cr];W[oe]C[it was a risk.. but I think I fixed the weak point by playing this.]
;B[ma];W[lb];B[lr];W[pc];B[qc];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[pk]
;B[ol];W[ko];B[rr]C[S3 also possible and bigger.. but I guess keeping sente was bigger?]

C[and this is the game.. I won by 7.5.. I think that black invaded too soon to break up my moyo.. if he would've concentrated on his own territory and defended it I think I would be having a really hard time. Instead he created a weak group from that early invasion, and thanks to that weak group I suddenly had a chance to win the game. But I don't know..
I would like to hear all your opinions about this game, advices, explanations, what I did wrong, what my good points are and so on. I hope that I'm not asking too much, but I want to learn as much as I can from this game.

Thank you for your trouble and time by reviewing this game, I really do appreciate it.
If you want to ask me something about this game or perhaps something that wasn't clear enough, feel free to contact me by email: Blizzeh@hotmail.com

;B[ih]C[[EV\] W must answer H11 at G10, anything else is too submissive.  This is just one possible continuation.  The fight looks easier for B than W, since B has W stones to play against, while the B stones to the left have no weakness for W to exploit.]

(;W[eg];B[dh];W[ff];B[eh];W[fg]LB[cc:B][be:A]C[[EV\] This is the usual sequence when B descends to B14.  White's shape with K16 looks good here.  B can exchange A for B immediately or wait for a good time to invade at B.]
