C[You have asked some interesting questions about this game which I have tried to answer.
However, by the end of the game, it is clear that you as black have played a much stronger game than white. I would suggest that you set your rank higher, try to play some stronger players, and send more evenly matched games for review. Although there are interesting points for dicussion in most games, your play will benefit the most from a review of a game that you lost and do not understand how you could have won. In addition, it is more fun for the reviewers to point out how the whole course of the game could change in a few moves! :-)]

;B[br];W[qc]C[I'm always really bad at defending corners and side, can  you show me some moves that either limit W's movement  or capture it's pieces?

You can not really expect to capture all of W's pieces here unless he makes some blunders. You have a good sphere of influence in the upper right and on the right, but you are not quite strong enough to take it all as your territory. In that sense, W's invasion is well timed.]

(;B[pc]LB[pd:A]C[I might play at A instead. When you have to give up some territory as in this situation, it is usually better to build a wall facing your largest potential territory. In this case that is down the right side. see alternate line from previous move.]

(;B[pb]LB[rd:A]C[A is better here. See alternates.];W[rd];B[qe]
;W[re];B[rf]LB[qf:A]TR[qe][qd]C[In the game this works, but I would be afraid of a W reply at A leaving your triangle stones with only 2 liberties.  He would likely sacrifice this stone, but the fighting could allow him to escape down the side or even capture a couple of your stones. If you play A then, of  course, W extends down the side ruining your good territory. You see how you are building a wall which faces a narrow territory at the top?]

;W[ql]C[again, I want to make moves athat will restrice white's  movement...

This is an interesting situation. It is certainly possible to confine W to taking a small bite out your side, but you want to make his invasion an utter failure. That might be possible, but it is a close call. W has picked the point where your position is most open, but you are strong. I will look for some chances.]
;B[qn]LB[rn:A]C[This move seems good. It restricts W's movement and strengthens your lower right. I am not sure if A would be better or worse.]
;W[pk];B[ok]LB[qj:A]C[Here is where you are making a commitment to trying to kill W.  An alternative is to something like A to harass him and force him to play at your game move himself.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[pl]C[Now your problem is your cutting points.]
;B[nm]LB[nk:A][om:B][ok:C][nj:D]C[ I might try A instead. Your stone at B is stronger than at C, W's cut at A strengthens his isolated stone at D, and whoever plays at A gets more influence in the center.]
;W[nk];B[oj];W[oi];B[pi]LB[qj:A][ni:B]C[A play at A will almost certainly kill W's 4 stones and is no doubt better. It would give W chances to damage your top after his connection at B.]
