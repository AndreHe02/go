AB[pd][dp]C[Kyo [16k\]: Hello !

I am Kyoshinai, 16k on kgs, and playing white. This is a game I played on kgs against grasses [14k\]. We messed the handicap thing, therefore I start with a two stones handi, since I am white. This game was pretty interesting though, but I made at least 3 _huge_ mistakes which I realized too late.

Please say anything that seems relevant to you, I've tried to analyse my own game too. So feel free to criticize my point of view and correct it, and comment on black's moves too.

Thank you for your time


g: I'll try my best. :-)

Gerhard];W[pp];B[cd];W[ed]C[Kyo [16k\]: Actually, this is the first time I begin with a handicap, so I do not really what to do. I was thinking that if I let B build safely, I would surely lose. But is this the correct way to attack ?

g: This move seems ok.];B[df];W[hd];B[jd];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc]
;B[hf];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[md];W[od]C[Kyo [16k\]: Again, I'm being quite aggressive, and I do not know if that is the way I should play (usually I'm more the shy type)

g: Usually, contact plays are not aggressive. This move helps black to get territory, but white gets some thikness. I can't say that it's wrong.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[ld]C[g: This move may be not so interesting for white, because black can make a strong position as well as some territory. See variation.]

;B[kh]C[g: Now white's upper right group is under attack. White should run out.]
;W[mh];B[mj];W[ro]C[g: Walking to the outside at M11 is more important here.]
;B[rn];W[qo];B[kj];W[dk]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here again I thought I had to invade the right side. But is this the correct time / place ?


g: It's the correct idea. I had placed it on C9 because black is strong in this area. Any fight would favour black.]
;B[di];W[dn];B[eo];W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[dg];W[ef];B[ej];W[cj]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[de];W[fd];B[ci];W[cp]C[Kyo [16k\]: After the game, it seems that this is not as valuable as connecting the E12 group. But I thought that I could still make it live later, and that I needed territory.


g: I think C4 is ok here. Otherwise this group will come under heavy attack.]
;B[cq];W[co];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg]
(;W[fh]C[g: This is an important situation here. See variation.]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[gj];B[ek]C[g: Now white has two weak groups. This is very good for black.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[gl];B[gn];W[io]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here I still do not think I should have gone on with escaping, instead of protecting the lower side. I am making quite an interesting territory, and the G8 group can still escape.


g: The move makes influence on the lower side. This is not territory so far, because black can still invade. It also threatens to connect at  J7, so this is a good move.]
;B[im];W[kn]C[g: This is a bad move, because black can isolate the white group in the center by playing E7.]
;B[kl]C[Kyo [16k\]: To me, this is quite an unnecessary move. B might have tried to prevent W from escaping with F7, which was more interesting, I think.


g: I think, this is true. Black should play E7.];W[fm];B[em]
;W[fn];B[fo];W[en];B[gk];W[hk];B[gm];W[fk]C[Kyo [16k\]: First big mistake. I was ready for long to give up the F12 stones, but I played too hastily, without realising my stones were not connected anymore.]
;B[fl];W[fj];B[hl];W[hh]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here I tried to have W live, but it seem I did it the wrong way. Maybe W E11 - B D10 - W H11 - B G9, and then try fighting the ko. Though I tried some variations, I did not come up with any good result.


g: After the exchange w E11, b D10, black can reduce or attack white's territory on the left side later. So I think E11 is not good for white.]

(;B[bq]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here I think B should have gone on with his idea. I have found no way for W to counter it, and at best W connects it stones but makes no territory. If you find a better way, please feel free to point it out.


g: Black is ahead in territory. He shouldn't take any risk. Playing at B3 is the proper answer. See variation.]

;W[sf];B[sh];W[sg];B[qg]C[Kyo [16k\]: My second huge mistake. I firmly believed the eye at S14 was a false eye, which of course is not true, since B cannot approach at T15 (the best he can do is fight a ko). And what is more I made some very stupid moves thereafter, which I really cannot explain. Maybe I should have taken some time to cool off and calmly return to the situation.


g: S14 is NOT an eye. Black can win a lot and lose little by playing the ko.]

(;W[pg]C[g: White should try connect his stones. See variation.]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[lg];W[je]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here is the consequence of my thinking that the eye was false. I could have played calmly at N13, thus making a second eye and then live. But since I thought there was no way for W to make two eyes, I decided to try connecting with the K17 group.


g: Generally, connecting is better than making two eyes, because making two eyes costs a lot of moves and the territory becomes small. However in this situation I don't see any possibility to connect the whole group. It seems best to play at N13.]
;B[mg];W[kd];B[nf]C[g: My review ends here. I don't see any chance for white to win in this position.]
;W[kf]C[Kyo [16k\]: Another bad move : I'm trying to make my group live, while it is already alive.]
;B[pn];W[jl];B[il]C[Kyo [16k\]: From here on, W collapses, and even without the final huge mistake the game was over.]
