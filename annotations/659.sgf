Q) What should i have done to invade this corner? OR is invasion a correct response?]

Q) is this meaningul?
(MyReview)meaningfull? B right down corner needs a few move for perfect eye space. so W can put more tight to the corner .]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[gq];W[qh];B[pl];W[om];B[nm]C[
Isn't this Click-missed move ?
I guess this move comes strange place.];W[ol];B[pk]
(;W[oh]C[
This isn't Bad and isn't good];B[nn];W[on]C[
Q) instead of this move i thought of playing N5, a diagonal extension to cut B if he cuts my stones... It looked too complicated to follow. I decided to play simple.
(MyReview) I guess so.White looks surrounded by Black.];B[ok]

Q) this move makes me feel the previous W move was wrong? was P16 wrong??
(myReview) I don't think so.]
(;W[qg]C[
Q) how about the answer?
so so, Q12 looks simple and easy.];B[ph];W[ng]C[
Q) I realized B could not play R14 and cut me so I wanted these stones to be more effective as threats.]
;B[oi];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[nh];W[pi];B[oh];W[qi];B[mg]C[
Q) i wonder what B thinking. This move was too defensive.
(My Review)I guess so.];W[lo]C[
Q) instead of playing at the top, I made myself secure here. B could easily connect the two stones and I would also be running out for eyes...
(MyReview)
Good decesion.This doesn't things complicate.];B[mc]C[
Q) Expected move, but I probably could not respond properly]
;W[kd];B[ob]

Q) I believe I gained more by playing these... Did I ?

(MyReview)Obviously, W just gain.];B[pc];W[qc];B[pd];W[pe];B[nd]

Q) was it correct?
(MyReview)i guess so.];B[ci];W[dj];B[eh]
(;W[dg]C[
This move is bad.];B[ei];W[ff]C[
? W down left stone looks weaker.
F9 would be better in this case.];B[cl];W[dl];B[bl]C[
Q) I guess previous W move should have been "under" the B stone :)
(MyReview)

I guess so, But I think White D13 should have been anothr place.]

Q) did i really need this one?];B[gi];W[fj]C[
is this necessary ?];B[ej];W[ek];B[ck];W[dk];B[gh];W[il]C[This is over jumping.

Q) i hadn't realized the 2 W stones were in danger until this move... I thought a lot here and took risk.]

Q) start of another big fight, but this was the plan when I decided to play risky. I wasn't sure i would be able to connect to right side. Anyway, now i am in trouble again.]
