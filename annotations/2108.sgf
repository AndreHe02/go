C[The review was requested by haniwa  for the black side.

Reviewer is Tommie, 3dan (EUR).
Comments are sometimes put in [ brackets\] to set them off against the players comments.

I used SmartGo by Anders Kierrulf as SGF-editor.
Several diagrams might be intercalated, please look at all of them.
The SGF is branched.

Please pay attention to the comments on the moves: 13 (importance of sanrensei), 19 (don't leave weak groups), 21 (attach for shinogi), 27? (pivotal point), 28! (taking pivotal point), 33, 47 (take sente), 49 (kill a group), 83 (wrong direction of attack), 88 (light play or direct live?), 96 (shape leaving a cutting point), 97 (not cutting), 159 (finish the ko early & kill).

I finished the game commentary after move 159.

I hope that you enjoy the commentary (I did),

;B[dd];W[cp]C[This fuseki is called "white's facing 3-4 points", I believe [Tommie\]]
;B[op]C[I'm expeCting white to attaCh [below\] and then to play somehting like the small avelanChe to generate outside shape here to work with my nirensei.

[T\] There is so much possible in this Fuseki.
Also the avalanche joseki gives many variations of which some are quite lengthy. Lengthy josekis diminuish the options for both sides in the rest of the game.
To know these Joseki & evaluate their usability in this fuseki is beyond my knowledge of Go.
Due to the upper left hoshi some/more ladders will work for black. That is a good start in complicated josekis with - on our levels - unpredictable outcomes.

Conclusion: Black 5 simply follows the heuristic rule 
"Corner, approach moves, side, center" 
and is therefore a good move.

Another possibility had been Sanrensei (K16).
We'll come back to that.]
(;W[pn]C[This looks like a good way for white to Counter the nirensei

[T\] I agree. To criticise/praise these moves is beyond my level.]

(;B[qq]C[[T\] Really just a flash idea - if black were playing now sanrensei with 7, how would white proceed?]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[kq]LB[ep:a]C[Is this ok for blaCk? white's position is, I believe supposed to make the right hand side unimportant for either side now, whiCh I think is good for white vs. the nirensei.

[T\] First I wanted to comment that "I don't like the gote-ending with 11" until I realized that black's kakari at "a" is quite big. Hence, white will perhaps not permit itself a sanrensei-splitting move (14) now and accepting  kakari a.

Conclusion: Yes, I think it is ok for black.];W[eq]LB[fq:a]
[hq:b][cn:b][iq:c][mq:d][dj:e]C[White closes the corner by kogeima shimari.
Later, white can check black with "c", threatening an invasion "d".
This could help building up a white mojo on the left (e.g. if there are stones around "e").

If white had chosen the o-geima shimari "a", black had options to threaten to invade later by extensions "b" and "b".]

(;B[dj]C[I played this as I thought the Left seems bigger than the right. White would love to play here.

[T\] It is true that white would like to play at 13, however Sanrensei looks also attractive to me.
To put it in clearer words: I find sanrensei better. 

In my personal opinion I evaluate power of the sanrensei minus the good development of white 13 
higher than 
the value of the actually played, good move 13 on the left side minus the white move 14, splitting the sanrensei.
The synergistic value of two overlapping (not redundant) extensions (K16) of nirensei 4/4 points is quite high.

The 4/4 point is made/meant for speedy development to the side.]
;W[jc]C[14: Good white move, indeed.
Necessary too.];B[hc]C[continuing with the idea  that the left is bigger than the right...]

(;W[nc]LB[mc:a]C[I expeCted A.

[T\] Because there is already 15, I also think that would be a good idea.
However see the diagram that some normal continuation is not satisfying.]
;B[pf];W[pb]LB[lc:a]C[18: White leaves an invasion point at "a"]

(;B[cm]LB[qc:b][lc:c][qh:d][ph:d][pi:d][ld:e][qj:f][cl:g][ce:h]
[fd:h][cd:h][cf:h]TR[pd][pf]C[I like this move loCally, but from the Continuation, would it be better to play b to sort out the top right and leave 19 and the invasion at c as a sort of miai?

[T\] Correct ex-post-facto conclusion. I agree. "b" is better (also simpler!)
Black got the idea from allowing white "b" most probably from fusekis with yon/sanrensei on the right where black builds bigger moyos to compensate for the invasion "b". Black could think that 19 builds up a big moyo, but that is not at all comparable with yon/sanrensei. After 19 it is still easy for white to invade the left side. The most important difference, however, is that the two triangled stones (Q14/16) become targets after white "b" and a checking extension around "d".

Imagine the sequence black b, white e, black f, white g and black somwhere around h. (Other players might criticize some of these choices) My guess is, that black is better off globally seen, than in the game. (cf. diagram)]
;W[qh]LB[qc:b][ld:c]C[Although I said that I think the white shape in the bottom right is supposed to be defensive and hard to Create terratory with, this looks strong as it attaCks at the same time as making points

[T\] True, on the other hand will a black move "b" urge white to defend at  "c".
White 20 is far away and could become separated from the other whites.]

(;B[og]LB[oh:d][ng:e][oi:f][nh:g][nd:h][ce:m]C[I was worried white would play d-e-f sequenCe here - is there a better way to play 21? I didn't want to attaCh to 16, in order to preserve the invasion.

[T\] I would have attached at 16 (O16).
The invasion (M17) is not powerful if white still has the sansan option.
Hence, strengthening white where white is not weak does not lose points.

Black 21, white d, black g, white f, black e is building up black strength, where black is not making points, whereas white d/f are quite useful.
Hence, I think 21 and black g would be bad (=inefficient) shape.

Also, after 21-wd-bg-wf, the black attachment "h" (= the move you thought about instead of 21) seem to me an indirect way of protecting the cut at "e". Then, why not starting with this move "h" instead of 21?

My opinion would be: out of this upper right quadrant situation quickly - settle.

If black would get sente - how much is a move at "m" worth?]

(;W[cf]C[I would have expeCted a 3-3 invasion to reduCe this moyo, but this looks quite good.

[T\] Also the 2-5 point invasion and others are possible. 
White 22 is bad ...];B[ce]C[because of 23!];W[df]C[Now white is made heavy.]
;B[fd]C[23 seems to be the only option, attaCking from below seems to waste 13, but 25 now feels Cramped.

[T\] 25 feels good to me:
I tend to call this the neo-Clausewitz strategy "Defense is the best attack".]
;W[ci]LB[cj:G]C[to play G felt a little like being forCed in my own area, but allowing 28 must ahve been poor

[T\] I call 26 poor because it would allow such an excellent move as G!

I have seen only one professional game where white played like this (Chinese fuseki) and it must have been under special circumstances.

Black must play 27=G for several reasons: 
1) it builds black's base
2) it takes white's base, resp. limits the eye space
3) it makes white 26 bad shape];B[ff]LB[lc:a]C[[T\] Wrong sense of direction!
27 could be right only after black 28.

Even in that case it would not build up a black moyo on the right or have a great effect.
Black's invasion a is not so threatening for white because she has the option for a base at sansan.]
;W[cj]C[Desaster!
28 takes black's base away and gives white a base and (last but not least)
additionally also makes directly some plain points.];B[pi];W[qj]
;B[ck]LB[dk:a]C[Difficult to judge what happens if white cuts at a.

(;B[rf]LB[od:a][qe:b]C[It is better to push at "a".
This 33 leves a nasty double-inside-peep from "b" which will be troublesome later.

It is ineffective, because it does neither secure a base, make territory or attack other stones.
For taking gote, giving white sente, I even find it useless.


For an alternative see the previous diagram.];W[qi]
(;B[ej]LB[ei:a][dk:b]C[How about H as a better way to attaCk white. I was worried anbout the Cut below 13.

[T\] 35 is a strange move.
I cannot see an 'H' in the SGF-file (hence, no comment on it).
Perhaps you meant the sagari downwards to the edge (like a permutation by a computer)
It is true that the cut at "b" (below 13) must be considered.]

what is the use of plonging down another group of partisans?
This is not a handicap game.];B[cd]LB[be:a]C[[T\] 39 at "a" is as simple as the played 39 and so much more effect on the white group below (and almost the same as 39 on 38).]
;W[be];B[bd];W[bf]LB[bc:a]C[I really don't like white's aji in the Corner,

[T\] White's play was not consistent.
Without the move 38, white also would have the aji at a,
hence white's aji would be bigger.

Anyway this aji is just normal to such corner positions.
Every one evaluates and hopefully finds the right moment to deal with it  (protect, counter or temporarily ignore until the aji vanishes).]

(;B[ko]C[forCed to proteCt against invasion?

[T\] That is relative ... (locally yes - globally no)
look at the many diagrams, which I inserted,  how black could have killed the white left group now (instead of 49).

Even if black was not sure about killing the group, black himself at 52 had protected the cut (triangle) in sente (this could have been guessed).

If white then , instead of being killed in gote , decides to attack the squared lower group a furikawari (exchange) would be even in size.

But black's group has the big advantage of access to the middle, whereas white's group is cut off of everything.

This translates in big aji for black (e.g. moving outside or destroying the left white shimari etc.) and white had not enough compensation for the loss of her left group.]

;W[dn]C[I felt hat this move gave white a real terratorial advantage so i felt i had to use the invasion in the top to mix things up a little, even though the group on the right is not very strong yet.

C[To 78 white lives in the Corner. My attaCking wasn't very inspired - I think maybe 73 at I or 77 at J are two options that look ok, but they don'tr seem to work either.


[T\] I covered 75 at 'i', it gave black a chance to take some points or complicate the game.
77 at 'j' just gives white a perfect move at 'k', because 'm' is sente due to 'n' (if this were not the case is a standard move).
 Here 77 also protects 3 points of territory and a bit the cutting point of 'x']
