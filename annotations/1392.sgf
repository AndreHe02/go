C[---> say hi
This keeps happening; I gain an advantage then I throw it away and lose the game.  I am playing Black; what could I have done differently right around move 174 to prevent the embarrassing loss of the enormous middle group?  Also, how better to have invaded the left side?

Hello, I'm just a begginner like you, but I'll try my best in this review. I just opened the .sgf file, so I wil-l approach this review with an open mind.]

Well that's it. My recomendation is to keep away from strength and to try to keep balance in the game, you only need 0.5 points to win, so think about that next time you want to play close to an opponent formation]
