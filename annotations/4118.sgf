C[Thank you for reviewing this game!

I may have won this game, but I feel like I lost it, and furthermore that Black let me off easy.
There seems to be some difficulty on my part on timing and strategy.

Andy (kiseki)(white)

C Hi there, this is the reviewer! My name is Stefano and I'll try to help you out on this one. 

My general advice (come back here after looking at the review of the game):

 - try to get a feeling for the "push / get ahead" thing (when you play near a weak group, sometimes it's better to solidly extend in order to attack later, and not hane!)

 - try to study the balance of stones in the opening (3rd and 4th line stones)

 - in the opening the important thing is to have strong groups, so that you don't need to come back to defend them later... this also explains a lot of the strange safety moves you find in josekis]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[cf];W[ch]TR[cf][cp]C[C Duhh, I don't like this one, because of C4, you see? 3 low stones on the west side already. Even one low stone makes its side uninteresting, and... you already had two there! (C14 and C4)
The fuseki principle is to seek balance between high and low stones.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[bd]C[This first joseki confused me greatly, and after this point, I'm not sure where the mistakes are.

C I'm not sure how to handle this too. From theory, this should be bad for black, but...]
;W[cc]C[C Right];B[dh]
(;W[di]C[C I don't agree with this one, I think in these cases the best policy is to build strength to attack later (hane looks sente but you'll have to reinforce later... !)]
;B[eh];W[cg];B[dg]
(;W[ck]C[C You need to hane at B14 first, it's very big (considering that black B13 is sente, too)]

(;B[fq];W[qn]C[C Hmm, I would have liked to strengthen the left side group, extending to C6. A bit slow, maybe, but makes your group strong. Esepecially if you didn't hane at B14.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[qj];B[mp]
(;W[oc]LB[jc:A]C[C Locally yes, but maybe it would be good to complete the shape of the upper left group, playing around K17. Also P17 looks big, but then it's very easy for black to reduce the east side moyo you are attempting here (maybe a shoulder hit at Q11)]
;B[jc]
(;W[lc]C[wrong/right direction?

C If you know how to handle your three stones upper left, then right direction
Overall, it's the right choice after you played P17 instead of K17... at least you're not changing your mind (which allegedly makes you lose 5 points ^^)

Anyway, Maybe I'd feel more like playing H17, see the variation (simpler & you get a moyo anyway)]

;B[fg];W[hf];B[ie];W[ke];B[jf];W[ig];B[gg];W[gf];B[kf];W[lf]
C[C Same point as before, nobi (extend) don't hane (turn)!]
;B[lg];W[mf];B[kh];W[cn]C[C You see, the problem of not playing a move like this early in the game, is that you need to come back and defend later when the action is much hotter...]
;B[fj]
(;W[hq]C[Better invasion point?  This whole thing was very uncomfortable.  I wanted to somehow take advantage of the losose shimari, and I wanted to be close to back-up stones.
However, even though his moves look like they are ok, I feel liek I got away with highway robbery.

C Sounds like a good reasoning, and pretty good place to invade.

Anyway, usually you want to invade where your opponent is making the "big points". Maybe in this line of thinking, you could have chosen L3. Still I like the idea of attacking the shimari.]
;B[jq];W[gp]
(;B[fp]C[C This move is not very ok... he is pushing you!! This was the biggest mistake. He need jump ahead, like var]
;W[jp]
(;B[kp]C[C He makes the same mistake as you do. He needed to extend (L3)]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[hh];W[bc]C[C Yes, but I think it's still worthwhile to split his groups (maybe K11), he can still seal you in, but you can make life with B17 the moment he does. Like this you leave him the option of sealing you in, without being cut.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[bf]C[C Strange time to play this move];W[gb]
;B[hb];W[fb];B[ic]C[C Useless move, you get to lead after this 2 empty black moves.]

C In the variation I explored on move 76, there's the obvious sequence when you nobi.. looks like a big reduction, but it ends in sente for white... Isn't that bigger?]

;B[ho];W[go];B[hn];W[fm]C[surely he messed up somewhere to let me get off this easy, and I messed up in a way that wasn't punished

C I don't think he "let you get off" very easy, for one thing he ended in sente!]
;B[ih]C[C Ok, if he gives up sente to play in front of white wall... >_<]

(;W[ag];B[bg];W[aj];B[bh];W[cj];B[ci];W[ch]C[is there a better way to handle this monkey jump?  I can't believe he go so many points in sente.

End of my comments

C Well, usually you can block a bit better, but not with the aji of the C7 cut there. And I think the end result is only 1 or 2 points worse than the standard 9 points loss.

Anyway, I explored a few variations along the way.

End of my comments. Look at the general advice on move 1. Bye!]
