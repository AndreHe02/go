C[*********Hello, my name is Rogerio Luz... I am "rogluz" 6k IGS... every time you see the remark  "R>" I will be speaking to you :)     I'm ManuelAzua, playing as a 15k in IGS. I'm sending this game to the GTL because even though I won, I played horrible go all along and my victory left me feeling uneasy.

I will post messages along pointing out to the mistakes that I see and to see if the reviewer can give me ideas for other more effectives moves.]
PL[W];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq]C[ Usually by this time I encounter my first problem in my games. Do I go for the mojo or do I attack white with a kakari?

R> This is a personal choice at your level.   In Pro games I've seen both ... since you are black the considerations are: IF he makes a Chinese Opening will I be willing to later invade? Will I be able to defend my influence after the exchange of joseki with white give him sente?]
;B[pj]C[ This time I went for the thickness in the right side.]
;W[nd]C[R> I think this is a bad play... it threatens nothing... just puts in check blacks influence. Since black can play at P17 a pincer here at R14 is very risky. See variation]

(;B[pf]C[ I welcomed this move as it allowed me to develop towards my stone at 10Q.

R> Q14 is more solid ... it balances 4th and 3rd line better.]
;W[kd]C[R> This white move is a little tall... a 2 space jump in the forth line is not connected as surely as in the third]
;B[co]C[ I wanted to prevent a doble wing fomation on his part so I attack.

R> excelent choice];W[cl];B[eo]C[R> actually this joseki is F5... since the pincer is one space farther, you have not to worry very much with the imediate safety ... so a 2 point jump works better.]
;W[gc]C[
Now that I see this move is gote, and calls for a pincer to the stone at
8C in order to take territory on the left from white.  See variation]

(;B[jp]C[ However at the moment taking this big point seemed good.

R> seems to me K4 is better than a possible pincer around C11 ... remember that the pincer is still available after K4 and K4 has the advantage of expanding your moyo and limiting his.]
;W[di]C[ And now that pincer to 8C is hard to make.

R> Yes but white is telling you "please attack my stone at D3..... please!!!!"  ;)]
;B[fq]C[ So I try to enclose white

R> good];W[dn];B[do];W[cn]C[ I then want to dispose of the corner. See varition.]

(;B[bq]C[ and this to kill the corner.

R> much better];W[qe]C[R> here it gets tricky... I think since he is at so a high position at O16 and L16 you should block at R16 and make him think you want to kill him enough so you make thikness again and possibly gain sente to play at M18. But that is just a thought. ;)]
;B[qf];W[qd];B[pe];W[pc];B[cc]C[I
 think this is my biggest mistake durig the game. It simply forces white to
develop too much thickness. Besides thanks to 17G I live small.

R> Yes you are right ... maybe playing at Tengen (K10) could work better with the moyo... and if invading is your thing maybe you could invade at C14... but this I think is smaller than your actual invasion. :)]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[bd];W[be]C[R> here you lived small not by his awesome play but by your loose play at B18 ...  this is better at B17, since he has a lot of weaknesses (aji) in the outside ( E16 and C15) he has to mend them before making a atari at D18... see variation if he choses to just atari]

C[
Now I was clueless as to what to do. Too much thickness for white everywhere.
Do you have any ideas that may help me dimish territory from white?

R> first of all your territory isn't that little as you would HAVE to diminish his territory or you will lose, seems to me, at least for now, that you are still at least 20 points ahead. Furthermore, P17 (sente) followed by O17 (sente) is a good way to make use of all that thickness you are building.  Don't forget Tengen (K10) too :)]
;B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[fk];B[jn]C[R> what is this aimed at? building territory?????? with thickness??????  bad... bad... boy.... :)     this is a moyo game... G9 is a turning point for both players... AND it's sente. ;)]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[hl];B[hm];W[jl];B[oc]C[ I try to take some space on the top from white.]
;W[qb];B[nc];W[mc];B[md];W[me];B[mb];W[lc];B[od];W[ne];B[il]
;W[ik];B[im];W[hk];B[le]C[Big Mistake, not much to do there. The othe move I though about wa a cut in 9L

R> think bigger... threatning to cut at L9 makes a lot more of a moyo for you... L9, K9, L8....]
;W[lf];B[ke]C[R> ?];W[kf]C[R>?];B[je]C[R> ??];W[ld]C[R>??];B[jf]
C[R> ???];W[kh]C[R> ????];B[jh]C[R> ?????];W[ji];B[kg]C[R> ??????]
;W[lg];B[jg]C[R> ???????];W[ki]C[ Now I messed up and the cut at 9L is undoable.

R> wow! that was a long string of "let me try to get white in the game again ... it's more exciting that way"  BUT... ther is aji for a great efort in M14...see variation]

(;B[qq]C[
So I play this move in gote. Maybe 3N would also protected the corner and
protected the space between my stones at K4 and Q4.

R> N3 never protects the corner... R3 or R4 protect the corner... and if it was a gote play you wanted protecting the corner this way is the best... now you have 3 corners and a fight for the midle... you are ahead. :)]
;W[he]C[ This move seems a mistake, I was expecting an invasion around the right side

R> this move is a mistake he must invade... preferably at the right side since it has a chance of connecting to his midle stones.]
;B[mp]C[ Protecting the bottom

R> actually if I were to be picky N3 is best because of the high-low eficiency, but N4 keeps focus on of whats left of the thickness to help the  right side too ;)]
;W[ll];B[km]C[R> no good, R7 is much more valuable.];W[mn];B[kl]
;W[lj];B[lk]C[ After this I go for the cut.

R> go for it! :)))];W[mk];B[lm];W[ml];B[mm];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk]
;B[nm];W[pk];B[oj];W[qj];B[ok]C[ I think that he should have connected.

R> not if he can live inside, R9 seems promising. see variation.]

(;W[pl];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[qo];B[ql];W[qm];B[rl]C[R> and here white loses the game... see variation]

Later when I went through this game I realized that the position was alredy
left, but the jump in to the corner worried me at the moment.

R> it is dead... no worry :)];W[tt];B[na];W[tt];B[ac];W[bd]
;B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[And
that's it. What I didn't like is the way that the board got to be, alomost
half white half black. It reminds me of the type of games I played when I
was a 25k and that's why I dislike so much.

Well, Thank you for your comments.

R> some pro games finish like this... great groups ... and who ever can make them live wins :) . You lost some good opportunities and he lost some too. Remember to stop and look at the hole board more often... and think on follow up moves for your plays :)
Glad to help ... any further questions feel free to ask :)   PS: Sorry seems my internet provider did not send this message for you. Sorry for the delay :)]
