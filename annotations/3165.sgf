C[Jaydee [20k\]: hi

jlim:  Hi, I will be reviewing this game.  At time of writing, I have been on a hiatus from GO for a couple months, so I would estimate my rank as 12 kyu on KGS.  Please feel free to ask stronger players for a second opinon ^^.]

jlim:  3-3 invasions are rather common, and without supporting stones, can be tough to kill.  If you aren't sure you can kill it, I would suggest at least trying to limit the damage by enclosing it.  

If you are not confident in dealing with a 3-3 invasion, and think you are ahead in the game, you can always play safe by placing a stone at the 3-3 point first :)  Be aware that this may turn out to be an unnecessary move.]

jlim:  An interesting game - W was only able to catch up after two 3-3 invasions.  

Tips for Black:  

After more experience with 3-3 invasions, hopefully you will be able to handle them with more confidence.  

Slow down a bit and read ahead a few moves when things aren't going the way you expect them to.  For me, personally, I can usually tell I need to slow down when I find myself clicking away without reading ahead a bit.  

Good luck and have fun!])
