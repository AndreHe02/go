;B[db]C[Olaf: an empty triangle is seldom a good form.]
(;W[cf]C[I'm not sure about this fuseki,can i play better?

Olaf: you are fine so far. :-) Black gets already a weak group that you can attack. Your last move seems a bit too solid to me. You can go evan further to a point around D10 (perhaps first exchange C6 for F4).]
;B[cj]C[Olaf: good point for black too. :-)];W[fq]C[is d6 better?
Olaf: i don't think so. F3 is the right direction for attacking the corner. A white stone at D6 would be outnumbered 2:1 right from the beginning. If you are afraid of the black territory he may get, there are some points to reduce it later (D9 for example)]
;B[dm]
(;W[cp]C[Olaf: bad.
Maybe, you will live in the corner. Naturally black gets a wall against the lower side which is by far more valuable.]

;W[cr];B[eq];W[fr]C[do u think f2 is too early?
Olaf: yes, i think so. Do you know what to do with the bottom? Perhaps you want to play around O3, perhaps around R6 to build a moyo by your own allowing one for black? What you do is burden yourself with some more stone to worry about. This way you limit the possibilities to only one. You have to try to safe these stones. Note: a single stone can be abandoned. Whith every stone you add it will be harder.]
;B[es];W[fo]C[i think that cause i played f2 then i must finsh my work,so i play f5 now.any comment?
Olaf: This sentence smells to me as if you feels abit uneasy about it, right? Thats good. :-) Now black has 3 white stones to go after, thats fine only for him.]
;B[jp]C[Olaf: ideally place for black, combines an attack against your 3 stones with an extension on the bottom.]
;W[cl]C[i think it's bad move but he reply me.at first i think to leave aji that place
Olaf: what is evan worth, if he reply, he strengthens his stones what has a bad effect on your own .  So you are forcing him to make moves he likes to make.]
;B[dl];W[qn];B[ql];W[np]C[i want to turn to attack at the bottom.do u think it work?
Olaf: the move isn't that bad, but the reason behind it is bad. Its not you, who is attacking at the bottom, its black. You can use this stone for some help for the 3 left stones, but think to attack is a bit naive.]

;B[qp];W[pq];B[pn];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn]C[Olaf: now look at the board. there are several secure groups with some territory. The key are the weak groups now. There is still the weak black group on the top and the weak white group at the bottom. Its your turn, so try to find a place to attack while treat to help you own stones.]

(;B[gn]C[very bad continuation,but i think black miss in this move.]
;W[gk];B[fp];W[go];B[gp];W[ho];B[hq]C[Now, that this fight is over, its time to examine the board once again:
White managed to strengthen the weak group and in his 3 secure corners got arond 30 points. in the upper right you can add another 10 points, so white has 40 secure points and no weak group!
Black has about 25 points at the bottom and right + a weak group on the top.  There is a comfortable 15-points lead for white now. :-)]

(;W[gb]C[i think it's not good but i still don't know how to attack this group.
This is a typical question and there is no simple answer. Perhaps there are more questions to ask.
How many eyes can black get on the top, evan if he playes first? Answer is in the previous variation.
How many eyes can black get after your move? Answer is in the next variation.
If black can't live easy on the top he has to flee into the center anyway. In other words the first priority should be to hinder black an easy escape route. Unfortunatly there is no single move the block black completly, so you have to attack more indirect. One possibility is K15. If black flees immidiatly, her runs through neutral area while you can get a nice possition on the top right. If he playes at the top right himself you are able to block black on the top left much more severe than now.]

(;B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[gc];W[jd]C[can i jump?
Olaf: perhaps you can, but why do you want to jump? Your move is good enough and while attacking, you strong to the right.]
;B[fb];W[ef]C[is this good?
Olaf: its not bad, but not necessarilly good. :-) You just build up a good position on the top. Now a move on the right would be great for both sides. As your move is sente against the black group, you can get this play anyway.]
;B[gf];W[if];B[he];W[fe]C[Olaf: absolutly needless. Better at R14 or there around.]

;B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[lh]C[Olaf: finally you got a lot from the attack. If you would switch the white stone at J13 to R14 it would be ideal. :-)]
