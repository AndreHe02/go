C[Hello
I´m Arnold and I submit this game because I´m not shure about the result of it if I had not resigned and about the moves i chose to play. Also I appreciated an "deeper" review )of course just if that´s possible) to see where I´m standing.
Thanks in advance

Hi Arnold.  Thanks for submitting your game.
I'll do my best. :)  I'll precede all my comments with 'Sirkut>' which is the name I use on KGS.]
;B[qd];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[qp];W[op];B[pq];W[oq];B[kc]TR[dd]
[dj][dp]C[Sirkut> I like your defensive openning, but this move contradicts that.  You should keep it up by either grabbing more corners and preparing for white to use the influence he's built on the other side.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[qf];B[qi]C[Sirkut> This is aggressive.  As you learn in the next move, S17 is urgent.  A good tip is to think about the strength of your stones before thinking about your opponent at all.  Wasting a stone being too defensive is better than being torn up later!]
;W[rc];B[rf];W[pb];B[rd];W[pd];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]TR[gd][le][oi]
[ql][jq]C[I think the game was pretty good until here: I had two corners and two were still "available".

Sirkut>  I agree.  But white is gaining influence quickly.  Consider the effects of white playing any of the marked possitions.]
;W[hc];B[nb];W[ob];B[jb];W[ec];B[cp];W[ke]TR[de]C[Sirkut> D15 probably would have served white better here now.]
;B[jd]CR[hb][md]TR[mb]SQ[dj]C[I´m trying to get outside/left-side influence by building a group through L15 and H17

Sirkut> Being sandwhiched between two groups and have one base stone in contact with white would make me think to play one more stone to give a good chance of living small, and then not worry about it until later.  N18 would probably give you the best chance of making life.  If white continued to attack you could either  jump out or over to get more space for another eye.
A better way to get outter/left-side influence would be to play the star point at D10.]
;W[he];B[je];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg]CR[ke][kf]TR[qi]SQ[le][me][ne]
[oe][pe][lf][mf][nf][of][pf][lg][mg][ng]C[Sirkut> While your run did get you out and built a dragon that's more difficult to kill, it also gave white a pretty strong block of territory, and equally sized dragon, and a wall facing your strategic R11 stone.]
;B[ig];W[gg]
(;B[dg]TR[cd]C[Sirkut> White stands to get a lot here, but has not protected the corner at all.  He deserves a more direct threat; C16.  See variation.]
;W[de];B[cf];W[ci]
(;B[ce]C[Sirkut> One-point jump is fine here too.  See variation.]

C[Here I thought the B15 group was dead

Sirkut> You were in pretty bad shape after E11.  You would have had to fight into the corner I think.  See the variations on move 45.]
;W[cm]C[Sirkut> This is a critical over-extension by white.  While white has a lot of influence, he is also quite weak.  Look for the critical opportunities to take advantage of it, but until you see them, be defensive.  See the variations on the next move.]

(;B[el];W[en];B[ep];W[fk];B[bn]C[Sirkut> Good to ignore white's last move.]
;W[bm]TR[bo]C[Sirkut> This shape is susceptable to the 'clamp.'  You need to protect at C6, C5 or B5.]

(;B[dm]C[Sirkut> It's usually better to cut a knights-jump at the far stone as long as you have some support on either side, otherwise don't waste your time.  See variation.]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[dl];B[em];W[cl];B[dk];W[al]C[Here I should have started an attack on C8 group but  I didn´t.....

Sirkut> C8?  Defend first at E9, then you have no problems.]
;B[bk];W[hi];B[di]C[...........At least B15 group was save

Sirkut> nice!];W[ek];B[ej];W[fm];B[fn];W[jh];B[gn];W[kq];B[iq]
C[Sirkut> Nice.];W[qn];B[ql];W[rq]
(;B[po]C[Sirkut> You have plenty of room to make life here.  You are letting black bluff you out of attacking him or making territory.  Don't be afraid to experiment and see if you can pull it off.  And remember that it's easier to fight when you have live groups (even if they're small) than when you still have to be worried about finding life.  See the variations.]
;W[pm]C[Now I had difficulties to save the three stones on the lower right therefore I tried to get outside and connect with an living group]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[rp];W[pr];B[pp];W[qr];B[nn];W[om];B[sq];W[sr]

(;B[on]TR[mo][no]C[Sirkut> O5 or O6 would be better here.  They give you better shape and still keep you connected.  See variations.]
;W[mo]
(;B[mq]C[Sirkut> Good idea, but you let up too soon.  Decide what you might be willing to sacrifice for a larger gain, then get everything you can out of it!  See variation.]
;W[mp];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[ok];B[pl]TR[qk];W[ol];B[qj]CR[sn]
TR[rl]SQ[qi]C[Sirkut> These two groups were already pretty well connected.  It's generally safe to leave two spaces between a two-stone wall and a single stone.  Consider how if you play S8, then you have a chance to connect to your corner group, and make your wall bigger which strengthens its connection to R11.  Try to make every move have more than one potential benefit.]

Sirkut> I cannot see a way to save them.  Notice that you started the situation that put them at risk by playing L5 on move 118.  Always keep the goal of keeping your groups connected in mind.]

But I think I would have lost anyway because the lower left (or parts of it) seems to be dead.
In the end this was an interesting game Ithink.
I´m looking forward for the review.

Sirkut> See my final comments on move 211])
(;W[as];B[kd];W[hg];B[le]C[Sirkut> Here are the few key things that I noticed in this game that I think will improve your strength quite a bit if you give them some thought:

1. Keep your groups connected.  Larger groups are harder to kill.

2. Defend before attacking.  The best response is often not a direct response to your opponents stone.  When you do play just as you opponent would expect, you are letting him control the game.

3. Don't let your opponent push you around or scare you into thinking he has something until he 'really has it.'  Similarly, don't be afraid to experiment and just try and get something.  If you don't get something out of it, you'll still learn from trying and your opponent will too (the score will stay about the same because your opponent will have to fill territory to stop you).

Games are lost (and won) by 'mistakes.'  So try to make as few of them as possible by being defensive and staying connected.  Then when you feel that you're in pretty good shape, lay the pressure on your opponent and try to get him to be the first to make the mistake.

Thank you very much for submitting this game.  It was exciting and enjoyed reviewing it!  Please email me if you have any questions or comments!]
