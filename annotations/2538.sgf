When white invade at R3, both directions are good for him, so I think it woule be better to avoid this pincer. 
You sequence was still ok.

Yes, you were right.

You are right. Black is a bit overconcentrated here, and as the marked stones are high, but it is still ok for him.]
;W[qn];B[cl]LB[om:A]C[I feel this move is wrong because:
- it pushes white info black territory (so attacking the two white stone may damage black moyo)
- if black gets a weak group, his moyo may suffer from that too.]

Black don't have much to fear because he is strong at the bottom, but the black move looks ok.]

Yes! You can't let white get connected. If white connects, he will be 100% safe and with some territory, then black has a group without base of eyes. Difficult for black....

I think capture the white stone directly is better, since is removes adji but this is ok. black have to care about there stones anyway, otherwise even the corner may suffer.]

Yes, this is much better!
Here black still have some territory on the bottom, and the difference of points on the corner is about 30 points (20 points for black now + white is doing 10 points on the other variation), so this is much better. 
Of course the moyo is gone, but not the bottom territory, and there is such a big difference of points!]

White M4 can be played at L3, it's a quite new joseki, but the idea is the same; white is squeezed and black is building on both sides.
