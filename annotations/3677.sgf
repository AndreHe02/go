C[Dear Reviewer

This is a partial record of an over-the-board game played in Cape Town, South Africa, in which I was white.

I will precede my comments with "R:"

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.

;W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[ph]TR[qc][rd]LB[of:A]C[R: Slightly inefficient for Black.

PC: Yes, 'a' looks better, and omitting the exchange of the two marked stones would also be a slight improvement.]
;W[nq];B[lq]
(;W[qq]TR[ph]C[R: I think this is White's first big mistake, because the framework on the right that Black gets doesn't have any obvious invasion/reduction points (see variation).

PC: This looks OK to me. Yes, Black gets territory on the right, but not an unreasonable amount for the number of stones invested, particularly considering the inefficient marked stone.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rq]
(;B[rp]C[R: I think this is a slight mistake. Kogo's Joseki Dictionary recommends the variation.]

;W[ln];B[mm];W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq];W[kr];B[ip];W[jo];B[io]
;W[dm]C[R: White should have played K6 or L8, because Black L5 is dangerous (see variation to next move).]

(;B[ep];W[ec]TR[dj][jd]LB[df:A][mg:B]C[R: I'm not sure if this is the best way for White to develop his framework.

At this stage I was fairly confident of my chances, but somehow things went wrong.

PC: If you look at the two marked White stones, you can see that D10 is weaker than K16: it only has one other White stone near by, and Black's C4s stone undermines your eye space. So developing towards your weaker stone, e.g. with 'a', is more interesting than E17, which is mainly concerned with the corner and (to a lesser extent) the top. Another possibility is to play at the border of the two moyos with a move like 'b'. Black would probably respond by invading the left side, as he can't compete by expanding his own moyo. I think that would give you a reasonable game.]
;B[dh];W[fj]LB[ei:A]C[PC: This looks rather mild. I'd prefer to put more pressue on Black by playing 'a'.]
;B[fh];W[hj]LB[fi:D][gi:C][gj:B][hi:A]C[PC: Again this seems rather easy-going. The knight's move at 'a' is interesting, though there's a risk that Black will counter-attack with Black 'b' White 'c' Black 'd', so perhaps White 'c' is better.]
;B[cf];W[bd]
(;B[ci]LB[cj:A]C[PC: 'a' would give Black more eye space.];W[cj]
;B[hh]LB[ii:A]C[R: Black is threatening to invade the top.

PC: The Black group is still not entirely settled, so if you keep the pressure on  with a move like 'a' then invading the top now would be a little risky. However, your group is also unsettled, so Black may be able to get away with it - see the variation for one possibility.]

(;W[hd];B[mg];W[jj];B[lj];W[ld]C[R: Here I realised that I had fallen behind. N13 and M10 were much bigger than H16 and M16.

PC: I think you're still in the game here, as Black still has to spend a move looking after his weak group.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[kh];W[fn];B[fo]
(;W[hm]LB[gn:A][go:B]C[PC: This double knight's move is a weak shape. The solid move here would be 'a'; 'b' also looks interesting - see the variation.]
;B[ee]C[R: Black is threatening F17, F16, E16, D17, G16.

PC: It might be possible to take a big point here and answer F17 at G17. I've sketched out a few possibilities in the variation, but it all gets rather complicated!]

(;W[gd];B[rc]
(;W[rb]LB[bo:A][cn:B]C[PC: You need to try taking a big point of your own, e.g. 'a', rather than answering Black here. I can't see a way for you to win after Black gets both S17 and 'b'.]

(;B[fb];W[fd];B[ed]LB[dc:B][eb:A]C[PC: White 'a' leads to complications, but I can't find a move for Black if White just connects at 'b'.]

(;W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[cc]LB[bp:C][cb:B][cd:A]C[PC: Now trying to hang on to everything with 'a' seems to lead to a ko. Sacrificing part of the corner with 'b' looks safer, and ends in sente to take the big point at 'c'.]
