C[Hi Reviewer,

This was an exciting game, and I have just recently become fond of thickness and how to use it.

I also have been practicing the Chinese fuseki a lot and would like to hear a couple of fuseki ideas in which to use it.

I won by resignation (as Black) but I would like to hear comments for both Black and White.  I was able to force White to live in two places and won the game.

Thank you so much for donating your time.

Sincerely,
Kyle Blocher 1d US

Hi !];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ic];W[cg]LB[dg:A]C[Usually this is at "A" so I decided to counter-pincer, as an attachment will probably be misplaced.
---
This move (c13) is sometimes played by professional players (see Kobayashi Koichi vs Wang Lei , ou Cho Chikun vs Kobayashi Koichi). But the answer is usualy at D10.]

;W[ed];B[ec]LB[cb:A]TR[cd][ce][de]C[Also thought about "A" here, but I felt I had enough liberties on my marked stones to push.

C17 is a weakness usefull for white to keep black separated.]

yes];W[co];B[bn]TR[dl]C[Another thank you move - doesn't White usually play this before A is played?
