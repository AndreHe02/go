C[Joe Carl (IGS 3k*, KGS 3k*) reviewed for White];B[dp]C[The game started with 3 stones handicap. They were placed odd though, but that happens to be the way they are placed on the site where I played.

(;W[qo]C[Slow move for White  Q3 is in no danger at all, so this is just taking territory.  It doesn't affect any of black stones at all.  So it only took and additional 5-10 points.]
;B[pj]C[Wrong direction.  K17, or D10 is better. Makes the game look like a 6 or 7 stone game rather then a 3 stone game.]

(;W[dh]C[Seems too close to black.  C6 can dive into the corner if pincered, but what happens to D12?  better to just settle your shape.  It's too early to be making weak white groups.]
;B[dk];W[lp]C[Jean: Some comments on the opening so far?

M4 is horrible.  Not only is it too close to you Q3 shimari but you ignored a pincer 

K3 is the proper extension here.    4th line is for influence, 3rd line is for territory.]

(;B[iq];W[ql]C[White only plays territory moves.  These do not effect black much.
If black answers them, then White keeps sente and then a bad move looks like a good move.]

The only time a kill should happen is if you attack and the opponent tenukis.  Then you can kill.  But assume he'll live.  Thus the attack move is doing something more than just trying to kill, it's developing something else.]
