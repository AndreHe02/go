C[Thanks for the opportunity to comment your game. Remember, my opinions are only those of an amateur dan, and are valuable only to perhaps stimulate your thinking. The real truth about go comes from high ranking pros, not I.   J Stephenson 2/7/2003]
;B[pp]C[I don't recognize any blunders in my game, but I still came out behind.

Ok, lets see what happened.];W[qd];B[do];W[dd];B[ci]C[C11 makes a hamete (trick) formation. The proper move is D3. Still, Black tries for a fast development. It is interesting. We amateurs may do whatever we want, so we have more fun with go than pros.]

(;W[jq]C[K3: slack. The left corner is biggest. Due to the C11 stone, white should play C3 instread. See variation.]
;B[qj]C[R10: slack. The top right and the bottom left are both larger areas at this moment.]
;W[eq]
(;B[cq]C[C3: F4 might try to work with C11 and flatten with K3, but may give away too much. See variation.]
;W[gp];B[cl]TR[ci]C[I expected C14 instead of C8.

A stone at C9 would be normal if C11 were not there. Imagine that it was Black's turn with C8 already in place, then Black played a two point extension to C11 as his last move; would you say it was slow? Changing the order (tewari analysis) often reveals inefficient play.

Right now Black seems behind by around 4 points.   If you must complete the left, D8 tries harder than C8.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[no];B[jc]C[K17: slack. Approaching the upper right corner is bigger than the top at this moment.]
;W[nc];B[fc]
(;W[fd]C[F16: perhaps an improper attachment because it forces Black to fix up his weakness at H17 naturally. White should C14 instead.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[eb];W[ec]
(;B[fb]C[F18: joseki is D17 etc. See variation.];W[db]C[D18: better at C17 for solid defense.]

(;B[cf]C[C14 is sente, but also erases potential for Black in the corner. So it is too early.]
;W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[bd];B[qg]C[R13: good checking extension.]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[ne]C[W34: seems slack.];B[pr]C[Q2: big move.]
;W[or];B[oq]C[P3: better at R3 for defense. Then the white shape still has some weaknesses.]
;W[op]C[P4: this is an awful atari. It forces Black to fix the bad taste he has at R3. White should simply O2 instead.]
;B[pq];W[nr];B[oo]C[P5: may be aji keshi (loses N4 peep).];W[np]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm]C[O7: makes mischief.];B[on];W[nl];B[ln]
;W[mo];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[pl]
C[It seems the white stones were forced to run in a narrow area. A minus for White. Black stones face the outside and can easily take care of themselves.]
;W[mh];B[gn]C[G6: seems a little dangerous to push in the direction of your weaker stones instead of directly strengthening them; i.e. at L11. Depends how much Black judges he needs to win.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[go];B[fn];W[jm];B[jn]C[K6: severe.]
;W[jl]
(;B[km];W[jo];B[kn];W[ik]C[J9: slow.];B[ii]C[J11: this could be thin. Does Black have to kill the inside White stones to win the game. If so, gambling is fine. If not, gambling is not fine. L11 may make a more solid running defense.]

;W[fh];B[fg];W[fi];B[eg];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[kh];W[jg];B[kg]
;W[jf];B[gg];W[if];B[hg]C[H13: this move isn't right. It seems like 1.5 point gote. Is J13 an important stone? (An important stone connects two groups, cuts the opponent or defends valuable territory.)]

(;W[ki]C[L11: White decides to help Black.];B[kj];W[kf];B[li]
;W[kk];B[lk];W[kl];B[il];W[hk];B[jj];W[jk];B[lh]C[M12: good. Now White must also find life. However,  remember G6? It did not secure any cash.]
