AB[pd][dp]C[First game of Polish Internet Tounament.
Me: white, 2 handi stones.];W[dd];B[qp];W[nc];B[oc]
(;W[ld]C[should have played the nobi.
(black stone isn't good: what better?)

O16 is more common see b in previous.  I think it's because the corner is easier to invade after O16]
;B[pf];W[dj];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fc]C[better on 4th line?

I am often told that the 4th line puts more pressure on B.]

(;B[eh]C[what!?
is it a good move?

I'd expect D12 for B instead of this, followed by something like W D7 to establish W on the left.  Losing the position on the left here may be the biggest source of loss for you.]
;W[cj]LB[ch:a][ci:b]C[what better move for white.
i guess this one is awfull.
a, b ?

I prefer a];B[dm]C[You might start here at b to get a base given C10.]

(;W[fj];B[fe]C[a is too low.  Need to pressure B more.]
(;W[ic];B[he];W[op]C[Hahem, what should i do whith those poor 3 white stones on the west edge: last black move is bad for them. dunno => playing else where.

See my comments around move 15.];B[pq];W[oq];B[pn];W[kp];B[hp]
C[This is ok.  Now, you still have time to reinforce your 3 stones on left.  However, they are out into the center so danger is minimal.

W is not in much danger on the top side, a very solid position.  The prospect of a B wall forming along here isn't too much to worry about so I don't see much need to jump out.

You could invade on the right if you like complications (W is supposed to like complications).]

(;W[lf]C[bad move i guess: it's still time to save the west white stones.]
;B[ii]C[Looks like B is trying to caputre W on a large scale.]

(;W[hi]C[here comes panic: i follow the well known phrase "attach to the other's stones for defense"; but perhaps should i play life on 3rd line?

Sorry, dont know that phrase.  The one I know is "when you attach your opponent will strengthen his stones" or something.

This succeeds in reinforcing B.  I would look at leaning on B in another directon befor beginnning your attack on the B group.  Trouble is B is relatively stronger than W here.  The lean strengthens W before the attack on B.

Instead try something like b (E8) in previous frame.];B[hh]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[gi];W[hj];B[gg];W[gj]C[I'm very bad at middle game battles: what could have been better in the same spirit?

See alternatives to H11 above.];B[pj]
(;W[jj]C[Too slow.  Still can slide to B7.];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh]
C[Time to invade: b, c, d, or e come to mind. f might be hard.]

(;W[mh];B[mi];W[mg]C[B should link with b which makes Q12 harder too.  So you got an opportunity and took it!]

(;B[lj]
(;W[ph]C[same question as previous.

Invading lower on 3rd line is still possible because of the chance of connection to N12 so you get more time to build a base.  I tried some alternatives you might want to look at.  See b in previous frame.]
;B[oi]
(;W[og];B[rg]C[b reduces B be more I think.]
(;W[rh];B[qg];W[qh];B[rj]C[b is the usual end game, but loses sente.  After B reinforcing at S13 a W corner invasion becomes hard.]

(;W[pb]C[that move will not give anything: is there better?]

C[Is it time for that? should have been sooner? later?];B[dq]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[br];B[jq];W[kq];B[mo]
C[I think 74 might be an overplay.  See if you think b works.]

(;W[kn];B[lm];W[km];B[ik];W[jk];B[il];W[ij];B[gl]C[b is Bs weakness.  But you may have to link at N4 first.]

(;W[fp]C[hmm... what else?];B[fq];W[hn];B[in]C[b is better and allows you to link up.  a shouldn't link.]

(;W[ho];B[io];W[ip]C[B will find b easier to deal with -- it protects lots of cutting points.]

(;B[gp]
(;W[gm];B[fl];W[im]C[I guess there are many  good sequences over here: feel free to show me some of them ;)]
