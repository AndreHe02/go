AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've preceded my comments with my name, in order to distinguish them from your comments.

The biggest mistake you made in this game was to play unnecessary connecting moves -- that is, moves which directly connected groups that would your opponent couldn't split anyhow.  This gave up the initiative too often.  The other thing you missed regarding connections were several moves that your opponent needed to play in order to keep his stones connected.  You missed chances to kill multiple groups of stones.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[en]
(;B[dl];W[fl];B[fj];W[nc]C[Ted: Note that White plays lightly, as this is a high handicap game.]
;B[ob];W[nq]
(;B[fp]C[My idea here was to try to cut-off the group that White is attempting to build on the left side.

Ted: I think this is better than your idea of trying to gain influence in the center.  It's easier to get territory on the sides, and this pressures White from the bottom as well as from the top.  Consider the Black position if there's a White stone at F4 instead of a Black stone.]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[pn]
(;B[oq]C[Secures the corner for Black, but makes connection with the remainder of the right side difficult.

Ted: R6 is probably better, but I don't think P3 is that bad.  Since you can jump to the right with your F4 stone, you can limit how much White gets from on the right side, as most of that territory is going to be not on the side, but in the center.]
;W[np];B[op]C[Ted: As the proverb goes, The empty triangle is bad!

I think I would play something like R7 instead, but not with the intention of connecting the right side to the bottom corner; rather, the idea is to make it difficult for the Q6 stone to get a base on the side.  You might only get a small amount of territory in the corner, but you get more on the side, and make it hard for White to get anything substantial.]

;W[oh];B[nf]C[Ted: I'd much rather play P17 here and put pressure on the O17 stone.  You may be able to jump out into the center depending on how White responds.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[mc];B[nh];W[oi];B[pi];W[ph];B[qi]C[Ted: Again, the empty triangle is bad!  Better to play R12.]

(;B[jj]C[Would answering at K12 have been better?

Ted: White is trying to get two big areas of territory, one at the top and one at the bottom.  Trying to reduce either is a reasonable idea.  K10 isn't a bad move for trying to reduce the bottom; I also suggested H4 several moves ago.  As for the group at the top, I'd try H13, or even H14, instead of K12.  See the variations.

L14 is, I think, another point of interest.];W[jl];B[hj]C[Ted: I don't think this is necessary yet: the K10 stone can connect to M12.]

Ted: I don't think it's vitally important to make certain that the group on the left connects to the group in the bottom corner.  The goal isn't to kill every White invasion, but to take territory while making White try to live.]
