C[Daedin: Hello. I am Daedin, around 5k on KGS.

Daedin: In this game I tried to apply a strategy to attack weak groups while getting points. However I was not really successful in this, and my main concern is : how could I improve this ? Is there a problem in the strategy, timing, direction or other general ideas ? Or is it rather a "technical" problem, i.e. do I lack technique to attack / kill ?

Daedin: Apart from that, any other comment is of course very welcome :)

Daedin: I hope you will have fun with this game. Thank you.

--

B.A.: I'll try to to respond to what you asked for, thanks :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
(;W[cd]LB[ed:D][gd:B][ce:A][ge:C]C[Daedin: I did not really know how to respond to this. I then did a bit of research, and found that Black has four main responses (from A to D).

Daedin: In the game I really considered only A or D (I did not think of B and C). I did not play A because I found that the result would be inferior to the similar tsuke-nobi joseki when White has a stone on the hoshi rather than on the komoku (the corner is safe in the latter case). Therefore I chose D, but did not really know how to use it.

--

B.A.: Most joseki sources, I believe, would call this move rather slow, but that of course, depends on the whole-board position.

As far as I 've seen, this move is usually played when White is strong in the surrounding areas, and wants to attack the D15 stone without making it too strong. Given the surrounding conditions in this game, I would call this a bad move.

A and D are both normal moves - I wouldn't think of B and C either, if I were you.

I, however, have to disagree with A being inferior for Black. It would have been inferior for White, in my opinion, because White could have gained territory in the same way by going one point farther - see variation.]

(;B[ed];W[qj];B[ec]C[
B.A.: Good, thick move. White should've taken this point.

It doesn't gain much in terms of territory, but thickness like this becomes very important later in the middle-game.]
;W[mc]
(;B[jc]TR[qj]C[Daedin: At first it seemed a bit far from the wall, but now it seems ok with the D15 stone.

Daedin: I also thought of a play at C15 to close White, but felt that it was a bit slow.

--

B.A.: I'm not quite sure about this. The length of the  pincer-extension is definitely fine, but what I would question is if Black should make a pincer-extension.

However, after exploring some alternatives, I can't really see why this would be inferior - so I think this is fine. (I've included the said alternatives in the variations - feel free to explore).]
;W[ce];B[qh];W[qm];B[qo];W[nq]
(;B[on]C[Daedin: P6 seemed ok during the game, since it allowed me to attack either O3 or R7. Maybe something like in the variation ?

--

B.A.: The concept is fine, but the move is a bit strange, in my opinion. It looks like it puts only a little pressure on either White group.

I don't like your first variation, but I like the second one - check out the comments.]
;W[jp]C[Daedin: This seems a bit far from O3. Better at L3 ?

--

B.A.: Perhaps, yes. Black's Q4-R5 formation makes cutting the White stones apart a bit easier.]

---

B.A.: Good idea.];W[nj]
(;B[mh]C[Daedin: Again separating. However letting White get N9 was painful, and it seems White could not directly connect.

---

B.A.: This depends on Black's priority - which group does he want to, or rather, which group can he attack more effectively?

At this point, I think Black has no choice but to split them apart - sealing in the lower White group would be difficult, if not impossible.]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[oi];B[og]LB[pg:A]C[Daedin: I did not find any better move to protect here. Maybe Black should then have played at P11 himself to threaten the cut and strength the link between his stones ?.

---

B.A.: This move is fine, as is Q13 (marked A).];W[pb]C[Daedin: I did not really know how to respond to this move. I chose to defend at the san-san to get points.

---

B.A.: Again, no choice, I think. The initial flaw in the whole plan, I think, was move 23.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[dj]C[Daedin: White keeps on tenuki to get the big points, but the top group is not safe yet.

--

B.A.: But it's very close to being so. I would probably tenuki myself.]
;B[je]C[Daedin: Feels a bit vague, but I felt that this move helped to build the top side as well as put pressure on the White group.

--

B.A.: What might be the problem here is another White tenuki. That makes me dislike this move see variation for next move to see why.]

(;W[kb];B[jb]C[Daedin: This looks like a bad exchange for White, since it doesn't really protect the N18 weakness.

-- 

B.A.: It's a preparatory move - preparing to attack, more or less. Given the circumstances, I think it's the only move.]
;W[df];B[mb]C[
B.A.: I don't know about this - White seems to live easily enough. I would try to reduce his eyespace with M18.]
;W[pc]
(;B[nc]TR[kb][mc][me]C[
B.A.: Normally, you should definitely defend the corner - this move attacks the three White stones, which in comparison to the whole group, are small. However, I tried some variations, and it seems there's nothing Black can do anyway. See variations to see what I mean.

Nonetheless, I'm convinced the corner is bigger than the three marked stones.]

(;W[qd]LB[rc:A]C[
B.A.: This move depends on White's intentions - if he wants to live with the corner no matter what, A would've been the proper move.]

B.A.: Black could have saved the corner (at the expense of the of the side, or vice-versa) with A. See variation.]

B.A.: Indeed. I guess White was afraid of jumping due to possible shortage of liberties.]

Daedin: I hope youu had fun during this game, and thank you again for you comments.

--

B.A.: I've tried my best. This was a difficult game to review.

Summary:

Move 17 was correct in concept, but incorrect in execution.

I would call move 23 unnecessary.

Move 41 was strange, and I would call it a tactical error.

Move 47 was a huge mistake.

Move 73 was the wrong strategy. White followed it up with a mistake at 76, however, and Black did well up to move 89.

Black messed up a chance at 113, and again at 127.

Black's invasion starting at 155 was smart, but I believe it wasn't nearly enough to turn the game around. The fiasco in the left side was a bit too favourable for White.

Moves 203, 227 and 235 were endgame mistakes.

--End of summary

I didn't comment much on the endgame because that would put too much detail on endgame counting, which I'm terrible at, and because the endgame wasn't a decisive factor in the outcome of the game.

Answering your questions at the beginning of the game, what made Black lose here is:

1. Various tactical errors, including the ones where you tried to kill White
2. Tendency to make unnecessary moves
3. There was one or two strategical errors, but not much. The significant one was the one in the bottom, when Black defended instead of cutting White apart.
4. Failure to realize when a group is really weak.

The last point is important - Black thought White was rather weak in the upper right, when according to me, White wasn't really. This also played a part in the left-side invasion.

Note: Points 3 and 4 are somewhat related, since 4 affects 3 directly.]
