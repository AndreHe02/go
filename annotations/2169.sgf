C[Hello Dear Reviewer,
I am playing Black, and I lost by a big margin. Could you help me find my mistakes?
Thanks!

LoP: I think the main mistake of this game was the F4 invasion. It demonstrated that you are only concerned about local board positions and don't think about the global consequences of your moves. I think this is the most important thing you should understand to become stronger.]

(;B[pf];W[pb]
(;B[lc]C[LoP: This means that you want to build outward influnce facing the right side and the center at the cost of giving away the corner.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[Is it a correct answer? It looks havy, but I think it secures a large area.

LoP: I don't think this is a good idea here. The purpose of M17 is lost. If you want to play here now then you should have played M17 at R17 before (see var. at move 7).]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[In view of Black next move, is it a correct approach?

LoP: I think this move is quite usual. But the next black move (R8) doesn't look too good.]
;W[qn]
(;B[ql]LB[oo:A][np:B]C[LoP: There is a overconcentration of black stones on the right side. Q10 already acts as pincer stone against R6. It's not a good idea to play a redundant pincer stone at R8. Also the important stone is Q4 since it is under attack now. Black should jump out with something like 'A' or 'B']

;W[pq];B[mo]C[What do you think about this outcome? I do not know if it is good for white or for black.

LoP: I think it is very nice for white. White went through black's position and has a pretty strong (nearly alive) group. Black's N5 is in very bad shape and black's territory around S8 is small.
I think white has an advantage already.];W[ml]
(;B[nm]C[LoP: Since the cut doesn't work black shouldn't play this move.]
;W[nl];B[ol]C[Seems to me this cut is not good - I did not manage to contain the white group.

LoP: This cut only helps white, black cannot play aggressively with weaknesses like S8]

;B[oh];W[nj];B[mg]LB[ec:C][ed:B][cn:D][gq:A]C[Seems to me f3 is much better now.

LoP: N13 is a slack move, it doesn't really accomplish anything since white's O10 group is alive. Other moves to consider are A-D. I would probably play A since the black group at the bottom is in bad shape and needs eyespace in form of an extension.]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[iq]C[LoP: Now black is under heavy attack.]
(;B[jp]C[LoP: This is maybe not good enough, since it also helps white quite a lot.]

(;W[jq]
(;B[kq];W[ip];B[jo]C[LoP: Because of L3 black cannot play J5.]

(;B[fp]C[I am trying badly to prevent white to close off this area, but pay a big price for that and almost get killed.
Is simply c3 better? or c6?

LoP: You don't think about the rest of the board.
White is thick around J5 and your F4 stone will come under heavy attack, in the course of this attack white will just make territory on the left side. Black has no chance to expand any territory from F4. So all black accomplished with this move was giving white a target to attack and the initiative. White doesn't care at all about the possible territory he lost around f4 because he knows now he will get even more on the left side, also his J4 group is not really in danger.
Before you invade like this you have to think about the profit white can make in the course of the attack. If this profit is bigger then the territory you destroyed with the invasion then it's clear that the invasion was a very bad idea.
(Proverb: Stay away from thickness!)];W[dn];B[fn]

This move cannot be good, since your group will be cut and then the group will not be able to make 2 eyes. J17 has to be better than this, it doesn't matter if it is possible to kill white or not, at least your stones are connected.]
