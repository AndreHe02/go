C[Hello. I'm KGS's Agilis, currently ranked 13k, and I'll be reviewing both sides of this game. I shall mark my comments to distinguish from the ones already in place.]

(;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc]C[I think is is pretty much the standard Chinese Opening, upto here anyways.]
;B[pf]C[[Agi\] Yes, O17 is quite standard, as isQ14 response.]
;W[po]TR[pb][kc][jd][kd]C[[Agi\] Q5 here is not really standard. First priority should be given to settling O17 somewhat or laying a framework near the triangled points. Black can make a lot of profit on the sides if O17 loses its base and is chased.]
;B[np]C[[Agi\] That said, answering Q5 might be more urgent, in which case O4 is a perfectly normal response. Safety before attacking is always reasonable if you lack the confidence to defend your Q3 stone after another white move down there.]

(;W[ql]TR[pl][qm][qq]C[[Agi\] I find this attachment very suspicious. More common moves are at the triangled points. I am sure white is trying to pick a fight. It is likely white is confident about their reading.]
;B[pl];W[qm]C[[Agi\] White has taken Gote here, the temptation to attack is strong. [see variation\]]

(;B[pj];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[fq]TR[or]C[[Agi\] There's a weakness in this position I feel the need to fix. White is essentially alive now and black looks thin on the bottom with just 3 stones. [see variations for some ideas\]]

(;W[eq];B[fp]TR[jp][jq]C[[Agi\] E3 shouldn't be played unless  there is a white stone  at the marked points. The idea here is, with a stone around K3/K4, to make the black group heavy and unable to make a base, making it cumbersome to run with.]

(;W[gq]C[[Agi\] I cannot call this anything but overplay. It is like an invasion, that attaches to a wall on the first move in.]

(;B[fr];W[gr]TR[do]SQ[dp][fp][eq][fq]C[[Agi\] The triangled point tends to be a weak spot to that particular formation of squared stones. Black has the chance of severely damaging white's corner.]

(;B[jq];W[iq];B[ip];W[er]C[I think I am doing decently well upto here.]
;B[fs]C[[Agi\] Black properly punishing white for the G3 mistake]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[gp];B[go]C[I am a little worried about my lower group.

[Agi\] In this situation, I'd say white is also very worried about the lower group also. Black can run away. White HAS to make eyes in that tiny space.]
;W[jp]C[[Agi\] continuing the attack seems almost obligatory. [see variation\]]

(;B[jo];W[io];B[in];W[ip];B[ko]C[I chose to sacrifice a stone for more outward influence.

[Agi\] Sacrificing things sometimes is well and good, but you should try to get the most work out of the sacrifice as possible.]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[kr]C[Here, I debated if I should have done the alternate B41.
But, I was somehow uncomfortable. Maybe, that's my instincts being not as they should be.]

(;B[lq];W[kp];B[lp];W[lr];B[cj]TR[hn][jn][fo][lo][or]C[I went for one of the remaining large points. I think all my groups are safe. Although now that I am looking at this again. I thik my lower right seems a little thin, and fraile.

[Agi\] At this juncture, White has lived on the bottom. Black has influence, yes, but there are weaknesses which worry me and can probably be exploited later. F5's cutting point in particular worries me. as does M5. 
K6/H6 aren't as important seeming as those three other points but can still cause trouble later on. As a rule of thumb, 2-stone walls are usually okay, but if  one section gets in a bad spot, a large chunk of it can break down in a very messy cascade. Always keep an eye on them especially near end-game.]
;W[ci]C[[Agi\] Again with the attaching. This is an imitation of some Korean games I've seen but I don't understand it enough to comment with any certainty. My feeling is that this is simply bad play.]
;B[di];W[ck]C[[Agi\] This clamp is very strange to say the least. Black can soundly split white up if he chooses. [see variation\]]

(;B[dk];W[bj];B[dj]C[Again outward influence. I thought it was a good idea.]
;W[ch];B[cl];W[bk];B[dg];W[cg];B[dn];W[cn];B[fc];W[ec]C[[Agi\] Again, this isn't a recommended play. The presense of O17 makes things slightly less bad, but hardly enough.]
;B[fd];W[gc]TR[ec][fc][dd][fd]C[[Agi\] This marked sequence strikes me as very peculiar and hurts white more than helps. White is inviting black to cut with F18. [see variation for rough idea\]]

(;B[gd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[lc]
;B[ne]C[I am really happy up to here.

[Agi\] Black's center moyo is certainly impressive, the game hinges on white's reduction, though it seems extremely difficult, there is only 1 tiny doorway inside on the upper left, and another slightly wider one on the bottom right.]

(;B[ef]C[[Agi\] I think you can get away with a simple extension, though this works also. [see variation\]]

;B[oo];W[pp];B[oq];W[pn];B[kj]C[[Agi\] I feel this is almost 1 point loss in gote. with so much black power along the sides, an invasion shouldn't expect to work if black is very careful.]

;W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[nr]C[All the way up to here, I was really happy with my game. However, now in hine sight, I am kinda wondering whey he didn't challenge me more about the center. But then it started to crumble.]
;W[lo]C[I deal with this move badly, I think. Maybe I should have just gone for the k6. But I was worried about the black stones on the bottom. Again in hind sight, I think they could have bee able to live on their own.]

(;B[ln];W[hn]
(;B[hm]C[Again, here maybe I should have gone to j7 in stead.]
;W[jn];B[im];W[kn]
(;B[km];W[jm];B[jl]C[I probably should have read this out a bit more, and reduced my losses. I think I paniced and just tried to stop white from taking more blindly.

[Agi\] It is easy and natural to panic when things start to crumble, when something goes wrong like this, just admit it's going to hurt and be willing to pay a few extra points to minimize the pain. Leaving weaknesses in your positions was what started the trouble, so remember not to repeat the mistake! =)]
