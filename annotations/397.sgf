AB[pd][dp]C[dear commentator!

could you please look after my game, and my comments about my
moves. i feel i had all the time no grip on my opponent, i didn´t
know how to stay in the game. maybe you can give me a few hints
about my strategical and tactical behaviour in this game.

looking forward to your review,   and thank you very much for
your work!

Duumvir

In this game black could have won if he had played more adventerously
.. in particular there is a ko that he may have won and secured
a group's life. Black shows good play at the end of the middle
game. To improve I would suggest that you practice life and death
problems .. not because you will come across the situations they
have but because it is very helpful to improve reading skills.
There was a couple of times where if black had read out the moves
he would have played differently. Also black needs to remember
strategy ... attack from strong groups .. see if there is a way
to strengthen a weak group by attacking one way so as to go the
other .. and use attacking moves to strengthen his groups.

I hope I have been some help in your growth in this wonderful
game.

Robin];W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[dn]C[wanted to play for influence..

Yes playing for influence is best];W[dr]C[But white makes an error d2 is way too slow so best for black
to capitalise on it



Look at my variation..]
(;B[cq];W[jp]
(;B[dj]C[is this ok? take a big point and make a side extension?

I think d10 makes your stones too conentrated];W[jc];B[pj]C[wanted to take another big point]
;W[pg]
(;B[mc]TR[oc][qc][qd][nc][rd]C[thought this move had two meanings: to defend my q16 stone and
to attack the k17 stone; is this ok?


The problem with n17 is it is quite loose. I have marked the
vulnerable points to the shape I can see];W[gc]
(;B[dg]C[i wanted to go on with playing for influence; however, i thought
playing round c 13 can´t be bad, either? what do you think?

c13 has the same problem .. presumably you are worried if white
invades .. see variation];W[ng]
(;B[qc]C[R17 looks right to me because of the weaknesses n17 created but
not necessary now .. all groups are weak in this area so black
does not need to be defensive unless he is planning to attack,]
;W[pm];B[nj];W[dl]C[what is a good response to that move? c8? (see my variation also)

See my variation .. as a general rule .. in an invasion think
about attacking the stone to build territory but only attack
from a position of strength and look to see if there are any
sente moves you can do that are defensive where you are weak]

(;B[cm]C[i thought with this move i can attack the white stone and secure
my black group];W[di]C[again as a general rule where you are strong play solid rather
than cut .. cut where you are weak]
(;B[ei]C[for the case white lives, wanted to build a strong wall to the
center];W[cc]C[You go the wrong way here .. block on the side where you have
a stone]
(;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[ej]
;B[ci];W[dk];B[cj];W[fi];B[eh];W[fk]
(;B[lj]C[my plan was to reach out in the center, prevent a future attack
by white and to go on attack on the o13 group of white; is this
a reasonable plan?


Yes .. but white has a lot of territory in the bottom.];W[pq]

(;B[lg]C[what do you think about this attack? what move is good in this
situation for black?

Because both groups are on the 4th line it is hard to kill group
so attack needs to be to either build territory or strnegthen
a weak group .. see variation];W[lh];B[mh];W[mg];B[lf];W[nh]
;B[mi]C[i was quiet satisfied with this development..];W[oi]
;B[oj];W[pi]C[so how can black attack this white group?

Black cannot kill this group at the moment .. so only attack
of you need to live, or you can build substantial territory and
it is the biggest move around

I would play a thick move now to hold the centre]
(;B[qf];W[qg]
(;B[qi]C[this was not good at all! maybe s14?];W[rf];B[qe];W[qh]
;B[re]C[again, bad move. should have played r11 instead i think.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[rg]TR[gj][mo][jq][hq][hb]C[This is not good as you loose sente .. looking at the board there
are a number of important places black can play];W[rh];B[sf]
;W[ld]C[Play thick here .. l12];B[jh];W[md]
(;B[nc]C[Too slow];W[mp];B[hq]C[i just didnt know how to go on, but thought i must do something
to reduce the white territory. what is a reasonable plan here
for black to play?

I think here is fine];W[iq]

;B[gh];W[ge];B[fr]C[thought this was worth a lot points, is there a point on the
board with more potential points?

No this bigger and should have been played earlier];W[je];B[cl]

Plenty of good ko threats for black   If black group lives then a good chance that black wins the game.]
