C[Rasa: First off, thank you very much for taking the  time to review my game.   I play Black in this game and am 18k on IGS. I have  asked a few questions throughout the game  concernig tactics. Could you give a couple of  general comments on my strategy that I need to  improve on *and* have done well with? Thank you.

benni: Hi, im only 5 kyu in germany and therefore all my comments are intended to be read carefully. My go-"wisdom" is very unsafe ;-) but of coorse i will do my best. If there are any questions about my comments feel free to ask me (benni@obda.de) or a better player.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qo];W[dp];B[op]LB[pq:A]C[benni: Of course there is no way to say a move is bad so early in a game (at least for me), but if the purpose of this move was to secure territory in the corner, than it was bad, because it is still open for invasions. the standard shimari would be at A.]

;W[qg]LB[jd:A]TR[pc][pd][pe][pf]C[Your stone A is in perfect distance to your wall (marked). Good play so far.]
;B[fd]LB[fc:A]C[I would prefer the low kakari at A. The reason is the balance of territory and influence. white is leading in terms of territory so it may be good to play low. the proverb says 3th line is for terrotory and 4th line for influence. But i am shure you know this allready ;-)]
;W[df];B[ff]LB[fq:A][cn:B][ck:C][ch:D]C[questionable. It is big because it is the frontier between two mojos (framewors of influence and potential territory), which is allways good in the opening. But here i think there are bigger plays elsewhere (A-D for example)]
;W[dh];B[jq]LB[fq:A]C[I would prefer a kakari at the bootom left at A, because your stones at the bottom right are so high, that there is still no territorry.]
;W[le]
(;B[md]LB[md:23][lc:A]C[Rasa: In the game this went bad. Would A, m16,  have been better or could I have played this move,  n16, better to keep these connected?

I think there is no way to connect with one move. I would play as given in the variation.
the idea is to take profit while attacking the single stone. even if you not able to kill it you should gain something, because white plays in your sphere of influence.]

(;B[ok]TR[hh][gh][hg][ih][ji]MA[gi][hj]C[benni: and again: the bottom left is bigger. but you should here attack the marked white stones to strengthen the black marked ones. alternativly you can discard the two stones.

(;B[cn]C[Rasa: Though I knew I probably could not kill any of  W's stones with this sequence to W156, I was  hoping to reduce his territory here as much as  possbile. I wanted to do this now since I felt this  was the biggest move. Is this correct?
