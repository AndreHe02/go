AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[OK, no specific questions have been  raised so I will just give a general review  encompassing both sides.]
;W[fq];B[eq]LB[dn:a]C[No, this move strengthens white more  than black. It is too early in the game to be  playing contact plays. A play at 'a' is fine.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[nq]LB[jq:a]C[This is an overplay, even in a handicap  game. White has only given 4 stones and  cannot afford to stretch out like this.

White should play at 'a' and make an  ideal shape.];B[lq];W[no]
;B[pn];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[nr];B[ns];W[ro]
LB[ip:a]C[Black should take sente now - an attack at  'a' would be very difficult for white to  handle.]

(;B[qo];W[rn]C[Notice that black does not gain anything in  the exchange of these two stones. In fact  white has gained!]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[mr];W[jq];B[ko];W[mp]C[These white stones are a burden now.  White should ignore them and save the  stones on the left.]
;B[lp];W[nm]
(;B[pl];W[qm];B[pm];W[ln];B[kn];W[dl];B[fn]C[Yes - good move.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[en];B[fo]LB[em:a][dm:b]C[This should be at 'a' or 'b'. 'a' is a severe  attack on the white stones but requires  some good reading. 'b' is much simpler -  black's aim is to make masses of territory  on the left side.]
;W[ep]LB[em:a][dq:b]C[Good move - makes miai of 'a' and 'b'.  Black is stuck for a good response.]
;B[hq];W[dq];B[er];W[dr];B[fr];W[gr];B[gq];W[fs]LB[em:a][dm:b]
C[Black should now play 'a' followed by 'b'.  The bottom is small and the bottom right  black group does not need protecting. In  the game, white gets a fantastic result in  the lower left.]
;B[hr];W[es];B[ho];W[dm];B[cm];W[cl];B[cq];W[cr];B[bo];W[bq]
;B[bp];W[cp];B[co];W[bm];B[bn];W[bl];B[em]C[No, black should play elsewhere - this  cuts apart two living groups so does not  achieve anything.]
;W[qf];B[qh]LB[nc:a]C[Better not to pincer here - black is open on  the right side so will not make any  territory. Extending to 'a' looks better.]
;W[of];B[ql];W[rd]LB[nd:a]C[It's better to shut white in with 'a'. The  move played is too low.]

(;B[qc];W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[md]C[A lovely result for white. He has played  into the corner and on the outside. The  game should now be won for white - his  thickness is massive and he has a good  lead in territory.]
;B[rc];W[fc]C[Good.];B[hc];W[fe]C[This is a great way to use white's  thickness - black is being split up and  should not be able to make up the  difference in territory.]
;B[df];W[db]LB[ch:a]SQ[hc]C[I think 'a' would be better. If black defends  the corner white can then attack the  marked stone.]
;B[cc]LB[ci:a];W[cb];B[bb];W[dh]LB[he:a]C[Better one line lower to attack black's  base. Alternatively, white might play 'a'  first to wall white in.]
;B[he];W[fg];B[cg]LB[hg:a];W[ch]LB[hg:a][gl:b]C[Capping with 'a' looks more interesting.  White can then attack the group at the top  and also aims at making some territory in  the centre later with 'b'.]
;B[kc];W[bd];B[bc];W[ce];B[de];W[bg];B[bf];W[cf];B[be];W[dg]
;B[cd];W[cg]LB[hg:a];B[gb]C[Black has achieved a good result up to  here.]
;W[fb]C[White can kill black in the top left now,  and should do so - it is very big! See the  variation.]

(;B[mb]LB[lb:a][re:b]C[Greedy. This severely weakens black's  top group. 'a' would be better - remember  black has 'b' to live in the corner if he  needs it.]
;W[lb];B[nb];W[lc]LB[kb:a];B[kb];W[la];B[ke];W[mf]LB[lf:a]C['a' is better, it forces black to answer]
;B[oh];W[rh]LB[mh:a]C['a' is better. White should get out in the  open and maintain a threat against the  upper black group.]
;B[ri];W[rg];B[re];W[qi];B[pi];W[nk]LB[mh:a]C[A bad move. These stones should be left  for dead. This gives black a gift of a  splitting attack at 'a'.]
;B[lm]C[Small and not the correct way to attack.  Black should think on a larger scale to  attack white successfully.]
