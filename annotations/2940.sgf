;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[le]C[roge: according to Yoshio Ishida P16 seems good]
;W[rd]C[Would S17 have been better? Or perhaps somewhere else?]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[po];B[qp]C[roge: Black R4 seems to be a bit submissive. I prefer O4]
;W[jp]C[Is it allright to use q5 as a forcing move here?

roge: I don't fink Q5 is a forcing move

roge: Instead of K4, P3 is good];B[mp]C[roge: I prefer o4: more strong]
;W[oq]C[Probably overplay. What would you have played here?

roge: I don't fink this move is an overplay

roge: It seems white is more supple than black

roge: suppleness is a very good quality];B[qo]C[roge: Here P4 seems to be the key point (instead of R5)]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[np];B[mr];W[nr];B[nq];W[pp];B[or]C[roge: black as no ko threads, so he can't play P2.]
;W[mq];B[de];W[nq]C[roge: instead of O3, Q2 seems better];B[fd]
;W[ce]C[Should I have played R3 instead? And who is ahead at this point?

roge: R3 is a very big point. But I fink C15 is more important

roge: I prefer white position. But the game is not over];B[pr]
;W[lp];B[cf];W[df];B[cd];W[be];B[dd];W[cg]C[roge: Before C13, B16 is big]
;B[bd];W[bf]C[Is this the right way to get thickness on the outside of the corner? Or is there a better where I give less territory? Was it right to give up the corner?

roge: White gives a big corner, but white has still good potential]

;B[lm];W[km];B[kl];W[ll];B[jl];W[kn];B[gl]C[Looks like black got the better result here...

roge: looking at the center white group (not alive), Black L10 seems very stronger]
;W[pl]C[Bad move I guess.

roge: Yes. You need to attack black center group while protecting your own center group

roge: K10 seems the key point for both players];B[ol];W[ok]
;B[qk];W[qn];B[pm];W[od];B[oe];W[pf]C[roge: bad move: black can answer at P12!!]
;B[pe]C[roge: Q15 veru submissive!];W[jj]C[roge: yes !!!];B[gj]
;W[hk]C[What would be the right move here?

roge: J8 seems good];B[ik];W[ij];B[hl];W[hj];B[gk];W[im];B[il]

;B[fl];W[fi];B[dm];W[dn];B[gh]C[Black should die here. what was the worst move I made in the following sequence?]
;W[ff]C[roge: I prefer H13];B[ig];W[if]C[roge: J12 seems better]
;B[jh];W[ih];B[ii];W[hg];B[ji];W[ki];B[hi];W[kg];B[kj]C[roge: L10 not urgent because black can live with L10 or E6

roge: L12 seems better];W[mg]C[From here on I was playing rather carelessly, so I dont want to bother you with that. Thanks a lot for going through my game as far as this!]
