C[uchihara:
Hello.
I played this game on KGS as black. Even though I feel I was leading during the game, it turned out to be a close game (Black +9.5 with komi=0.5).
I would appreciate pointers on big moves I missed, mistakes I made as well as answers to my questions.

Thank you!

Christian: 9.5 points is not a close game.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq]

(;B[ej]C[uchihara:
is this move ok? It seems to be a little passive. Maybe should I have played somewhere else?

Christian: Yes, this move is too slow.

;B[qn]C[... good! That hurts!];W[pn];B[pm]C[uchihara:
I don't know if this move is bad. Maybe R7 is better ?

Christian: I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to answer this question.

Since there is a stone at O4, this is not aji-keshi - you can cut at P6 later.

The more I think about it, the more I like Q7.];W[om];B[pl]

Is K3 a better move than Q11 or R11?
Being surrounded in the right side was a problem for me later in the game.

Christian: The lower side is more important.];W[qj];B[rj];W[pk]

is this the good direction? I thought that R16 would not give enough territory for black.

I feel like this move was pretty bad: too much stones and I'm not surround enough territory
