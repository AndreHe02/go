C[baru :
Hi this is my game at IGS I'm playing black here.
I lost 12 points without komi because my opponent is 16k player.
I don't know much about joseki and fuseki could you please give some suggestion and thank you for reviewing my game]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc]C[baru :
is this approach correct ? what is the best move ?

PNH: This approach (kakari) is excellent. There is no single best move in this position.]
;W[hc]C[baru :
ugh i hate when white pincered me];B[fe]C[PNH: But this is a fine answer.]
;W[cf];B[he];W[kc];B[mc]C[baru :

the purpose of this move is to attack white from both side
is this move to long ? should at o17 or is there any best move ?

PNH: I think this is excellent. Better than O17, maybe.];W[oc]
;B[pc];W[od];B[pe];W[md];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[nc]C[PNH: White played well but he's stronger than me! A stronger player might advise you on a better defense with these last few moves...]
;B[id]TR[cn][fq]C[PNH: This peek might be a bit premature. Your stones are in no immediate danger and there is much unclaimed territory along the sides.]
;W[ic];B[jd]C[PNH: Same comment. This is not a proper opening move. White could ignore this and play something big elsewhere.]
;W[kd];B[jc]TR[ci][qk][cn][fq]C[PNH: Same comment. The marked points are all more important. I would favor F3 or C6 myself since they compel an answer from white.]
;W[jb]C[PNH: You might think it is good since white is forced to reply. However it is bad since it removes "aji" (potential). These moves can be used later in the game with more effect (as "ko" threats for instance).]
;B[ke]C[PNH: This also gives back initiative to white for him to make some big territory point.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[qg]C[PNH: This is what I meant.];B[qf];W[pg]
;B[qo]TR[qk]C[PNH: Good. Although somewhere around R9 might be better. Not any higher however (such as R10). You must never play close to a wall, either your own or your opponent's.

Playing close to your wall is inefficient (overconcentrated). And playing close to an enemy wall is suicidal. (You can get squeezed and crushed.)]
;W[qk];B[lf]C[PNH: Bad timing. Claim territory first. The sequence : 1) corners, 2) sides, 3) center is primordial in Go. There is always less territory in the center than it seems. Only move to the center to escape with a weak group in case of emergency (when your group does not have a base and could easily be killed)]
;W[mf];B[cj]C[PNH: I prefer something like C6. Your move allows C7 and you do not have a base.]
;W[cm];B[dh];W[ef];B[ek]C[PNH: Your escape gives white much advantage.]
;W[bh];B[mp]TR[jq]C[PNH: This is too timid. Go at least for K2.]
;W[kq];B[iq]C[PNH: Good. This is a proper response.];W[ko];B[fq]
SQ[iq]C[PNH: Very good again. You make an ideal base.];W[dq]
;B[io]C[PNH: Very good. You consolidate your group while attacking white.]
;W[mr];B[mn];W[lo];B[mo];W[kl];B[en];W[dn];B[il];W[gm];B[gk]
;W[em];B[eo];W[ep];B[fp];W[im]LB[ff:1]TR[dh][cj][ek][gk][il]
SQ[fc][jc][id][jd][fe][he][ke][kf][lf]C[PNH: It will be hard to threaten white now that he is virtually connected. You however have two groups that could easily be attacked. For this reason I might play something like F14 here]
;B[jj]C[PNH: This still works towards connecting your two groups but it allows white to invade.]
;W[fg];B[hh];W[fj];B[fl]C[PNH: This is a nice trick.];W[fm]
;B[fi];W[gg];B[hg];W[gi];B[gh];W[fh];B[ei]C[PNH: Very well played.]
;W[gd];B[bl];W[bm];B[dl]C[PNH: Answering white's G16 is now more urgent. This only removes aji. (potential ko threats for later)]
;W[dm];B[ml]TR[ge]C[PNH: Same comment. You can not cut and kill white anymore, I do not think.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[ho]SQ[gm][im][go]C[PNH: You will learn to recognize this pretty and useful shape. (good for making eyes)]
;B[in]

;W[jo];B[im];W[gq];B[gr];W[gn];B[hs]C[PNH: You seem to have a quite good feeling for life and death for a two month old player!]
;W[js];B[is];W[ir];B[ks];W[jq];B[hr]C[PNH: Now you live. Congratulations.]
;W[or]
(;B[nq]SQ[pr]C[PNH: I would have blocked along the side, myself. See variation. But you might be a better player than I ;-)]
;W[nr];B[lq];W[lp];B[lr]C[PNH: Very good tactical play!];W[mq]
;B[ls];W[oq];B[pp];W[ms];B[js];W[op]
(;B[oo]C[baru :
i think p5 is a wrong move because white can make two eyes here
could you give  variations that can kill white

PNH: O4 seems to work. See variation.];W[np];B[pr];W[os];B[ps]
;W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[mm];W[nk];B[mk]SQ[fc][fe]C[PNH : The center is not so important. Take care of the top first.]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[mi];B[li];W[mh];B[lh];W[qm];B[rf];W[ge]C[PNH: This was an important point.]

SQ[na]C[PNH: This is "gote" (gives initiative back to white) You should play something "sente" like O19.]
;W[sm];B[rp];W[cl];B[pj];W[oi]C[PNH: This only removes "aji"]

that's it the game is over i lost 12 point,but i think is not so bad for 28k, huh ?
any suggestion for me to improving my game i just learn  go for 2 months because go not very popular in my country is very difficult to find book about go.
Anyway thanks for reviewing my game for me. i'm really appreciated

PNH: You are mighty strong for a two months old player. Follow only some of my general advices and you will beat me if we meet online. Focus more on border territory on the opening (right after the corners) and you'll gain two stones in strength right away. Right now tactics is really your strong point.

Good luck, and continue to enjoy this beautiful game,

(;B[np];W[oo];B[pm];W[nm];B[mm];W[ok];B[om]C[PNH: This might work. You have to try some variations. You seem as good as me in tactical play!]

(;B[pr];W[lp];B[mq];W[ls];B[ns];W[nr];B[os];W[js];B[fs]C[PNH: You live unconditionally but white must win the "ko" to live also. You need to make many ko threats to win this ko. See my earlier comments about "aji".]
