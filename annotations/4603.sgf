C[Hi,

The main thing you need to realize is that you cannot form too many weak groups in the beginning. They will plague you for the entire game and prevent you from taking the initiative.

When I say too many weak groups, I mean you can only have as many as your opponent (if he has a weak group, then you can afford to have a weak group also).

You must also become aware of the concept of exchange. Many of your moves allowed Black to gain at your direct expense. You must gain at least as much as Black if you don't want to lose.]

(;W[pn]LB[po:A]C[You could also have approached the corner at A.

Please look at the variation, it will be used as the basis of the discussion.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qk];W[po];B[qp]LB[qk:A][mq:B]C[Notice that this is the same position as the joseki I have showed you earlier, and we see that Black has made his choice.

He chose A instead of B. I said that Black would like to play A and B at the same time, but he cannot, he can only play one of the possibilities, because now it is your turn to play.

Let us consider the possibility that Black would have chosen B instead.]

(;W[qg]LB[qk:A][mq:B]C[Was it a good move to place a stone here?
I was trying to threathen r9 and the right structure.

--------------------
Please look at the variation where Black plays B instead, then come back here.




Remember that I said Black wants to play at A and B. By playing at R13, you are letting Black play at A and B!

Black is developping better than you are. This is horrible.

What should you do instead? You should prevent Black from playing at B.]
;B[mq]LB[qk:A][mq:B]TR[qg]SQ[pn][qn][po]C[Oh no, Black got A and B!!

Your stones are now heavy and you have a single stone that has no base. Black will be able to profit from attacking you.

If I was Black, I would feel pretty relaxed right now, and looking forward to an easy game.]
;W[dk];B[nc];W[iq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn]

(;W[bm]TR[cm][do]C[This move is not so good, you're leaving weaknesses behind that may be exploited later.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
(;W[fr]TR[eq]C[Again, you are leaving a weakness for yourself.

A weakness is usually something that your opponent can exploit for goals that have nothing to do with the weakness.

Obvisouly, black cannot cut. But he can use this weakness to reduce your moyo (making your stones overconcentrated).]
;B[dj]TR[cd][df]SQ[qg][pn][qn][po]C[What is Black trying to do here?

He is trying to seperate your stones. You must not let him seperate your stones.

You may not be aware of it, but once you are seperated, your 2 stones become very weak.

You already have weak stones all over the board, you cannot afford to get more (the more weak groups you have, the higher the chance that one of them will die).

There doesn't seem to be goot solutions for you. There are too many ways in which black can hurt you.]

But when i look at it again, it doesn't seem all that great.

---------------

It is not all that great. There is a proverb that says, don't play close to thickness. Black is thick here, don't play close to him.

You will be attacked and black will gain profit from attacking you (he may not be able to kil this stone, but he can build up a wall that will allow him to kill other groups).]

;W[hi];B[gh];W[gi];B[jg];W[qc]C[I think I had many problems securing the top right corner.

----------

No, the problem is too many weak groups, you can't afford to invade the corner, you have to take care of your weak groups first.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[qf]C[You only made yourself weaker (i.e. you made Black stronger).

Why are you trying to save this stone? Black will die anyway.]

You made the mistake of trying to save a useless stone, and this let Black destroy you.]

If you had solidfied your group at the beginning of the game, you would not be stuck in this situation, you could be in an offensive position here (to reduce Black's territory at the bottom).]

Where do you play?

Well you know that if you play somewhere away form this corner, Black will play at A. (You know this because Black played at A in the real game).

Knowing this, you want to prevent Black from playing at A by playing at A yourself (actually, you would play 1 line higher - remember the proverb, from 1 jump 2, from 2 jump 3, ...).

So A and B can be seen as an exhange. Black plays B and lets White prevents him from playing at A.]

You get a nice little wall that works well with your stones. This will lead to some good development potential.

Notice that the black stone is caught in a ladder, if Black plays a ladder breaker, you will need to capture black otherwise you will be cut.

I would advise you to capture the stone before Black gets the chance to play a ladder breaker.]
