A:
I'm andre, I'll do my best in reviewing this game.];B[pd];W[dq]
;B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[co]TR[cc][fc][fd][cf][df]C[A :
This opening is rather weird, your 2 stones are at hoshi which means prone to attacks. Usually the 3rd move or Black 7 is at Q10. If you like attack more than defense, you can attack D16 at some spots depending on what do u want. D 16 is weaker than D3.]
;W[cm];B[fq]C[A :
This answer creates 2 weak stones : D3 and C5, only one will prevail]
;W[eo]C[A :
now white tries to cut the connection between C5 and F3, how black should react ? either abandon C5 and play at bigger spot such as G5 and attract an attack at around K3 and then cut the connection between D3 and E5 or test white's reaction by attacking D16 or touch D3 at c3 to strengthen position. Many possibilities at this point. your answer at F3 creates complicated battle.]

(;B[dn]C[A :
You threaten C7 with 2 weak stones ? this won't work.];W[cn]
C[A:
I think this is white's mistake, you should use this opportunity to threaten c3-E5 connection as well by playing at d4.]

(;B[do];W[ep]
(;B[en]C[A :
I prefer e7 than this move];W[dm];B[kq]C[A:
this move is weak!
d3 worm can still make some territory by attacking around j3]
;W[gc];B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[fn];W[go];B[hn]C[A:
Instead of saving F6 worm, why not abandon it or using it to strengthen G4 area and then play around Q10 which is the largest point right now.]
;W[gn];B[fl];W[dj];B[ic]C[A :
This move is too weak white can hasame at N17 while attacking Q16 at the same time]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[hm];B[kn]C[A :
with this move, you decided to abandon H5 area and strengthen N5 area, let me remind you that your corners aren't secured yet.]
;C[Until the move 29th, I feel the black moves a little bit slow here; resulting in sacrifice of the black 21. Is there any better position to invade the white place for I suppose the black 7 is the root caused this competition.

A:
I've answered this question, at this point you've already read my comments.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc]TR[ic]C[A:
This is false, this move strengthen white and weaken your stone J17.See Variations.]
;W[nd];B[lc];W[mc];B[eb]TR[cc]C[A:
You should strengthen M17 group before attacking here.
E18 spot is not good, you should attack at C17];W[gb];B[cc]

(;W[ac]C[A:
A false move by white, white should be able to kill B18 snake, see variation]
;B[ab];W[be];B[ba];W[ec];B[fb];W[fc];B[ie]C[From the move 35th to 50th, I think the compound of the black is compressed too low, which the black side cannot be satisfied, for it makes white place more concrete outside reinforce the with the 24th (white stone). However, if the replacement with the stone on D14 nearby, it seems to be rush to invade the white area, that is not encouraged when reading some book. Or what else ought to be better move in compared to the move previously referred to?]
