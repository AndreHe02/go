;B[dq];W[dc]
;B[pq];W[qd];B[jp];W[co];B[ok]C[It would be better here to play in direct response to white's C5.  Perhaps something like E4 or E5...]
;W[ep];B[fr]C[D3 would be more solid.];W[dp];B[cq];W[oc];B[pg]
;W[jc];B[dj];W[oe];B[lm]C[An approach move at D15 or C15 would be good timing here.]
;W[ld];B[cg]C[You could safely play higher - W should reply, allowing you to then play a stone around here.]
;W[ce];B[mk]C[You have two stones that are not very strong on the left side.  A good move would be C7 or C8.]
;W[gc];B[eh];W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[bp];B[bq];W[ef];B[fk]
;W[em];B[dl]C[Good move - this strengthens your weak stone at C8 and puts some pressure on W.]
;W[dm];B[gi];W[gg];B[ni];W[mg];B[il];W[gm];B[in];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[rf];B[rg];W[qf];B[qg];W[ih];B[ij];W[ki];B[kj]
;W[ji];B[lh];W[li];B[mi];W[hh];B[gh];W[fg];B[eg];W[df];B[dg]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[ff];B[jj]C[It would have been good to connect at N12, and get support for the lone stone at M12.]
;W[lj];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[mj];B[nj];W[mh]C[Now it is too late, and you missed getting into W's territory.]
;B[nh];W[nf];B[pi]C[Not really needed.];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[gr]
;W[hp];B[hr]C[J3 might be a bit better.];W[bm];B[fq];W[fp];B[ip]
;W[ho];B[io];W[hn];B[el];W[fl];B[gl];W[fm];B[nl]C[A safe move, but slow.  W cannot really do much there.  However, W could live on the right side, if you don't play around R4 or R5...]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[jk];B[ik];W[lg];B[og];W[pf];B[ag]C[The usual move here is A14, followed by W A15, then B A13.  This move, however, keeps sente for you, since W replied.]
;W[af];B[ak];W[aq];B[ar];W[ap];B[br];W[sg];B[al]C[Oh, big mistake...  W should not have played A7, and if he had played the right side, at T11, it would have cost you a lot.]
;W[am];B[sh];W[sf];B[rh];W[hl];B[im]C[Why not just connect at G9, and save the stone?  There is no worry here that W can push through.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[mo];B[mq];W[ko];B[mm];W[on];B[po];W[nn];B[pm]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[ln];B[mn];W[no];B[op];W[mp];B[nq];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[kn];B[jq]C[This move is superfluous.  If you had played at Q6, W could not have even tried to push through on the right.  But, all in all, you played this sequence solidly.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ro];W[rn];B[so];W[sn];B[rl]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[hi];B[hj];W[nm];B[ml]C[Not needed.]
;W[kh];B[ng];W[jm];B[dr]C[Not needed.  Each move like this costs you one point.]
;W[hm];B[cf];W[be];B[hk];W[gl];B[gj];W[hd]C[You won by 6 points, and should have won by a few more - if you hadn't played those unneeded moves in your own territory.  While you played a passive game, that's what you need to do as a beginner.  Play solid, then attack when you are sure you are safe.  Good luck.]
