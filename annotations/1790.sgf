C[Dear Commentator,
My name is Martin, i am playing white (i am 2k-1k in Germany). This was a reasonably fast game on KGS. I think it is still ok to ask for a review for this game, because i have serious questions ;).

I know i played this a little too relaxed at the beginning, but on the other hand those games show the general mistakes of the player more clearly than when one is trying very hard.

I have two questions:
One is about the very beginning how about my try against the chinese fuseki. I more or less completely missed the goal and was behind from then on (i did not count during the game though).

The second is more general: since i lost only by 9 points (without the 0.5 komi) there were probably  chances for me to get those points. I wonder where.

I am more interested in strategic arguments for decisions than in detailed variations on local tactics (though thats where the decision is made ;).
Thank you very much in advance,  Martin.];B[pp]C[Hello , Martin , I am the reviewer . My go strength
is around 4 D in china which means 3 handicaps to professional player . currently , I have serveral 5D* account in IGS . 

Well , My English is not so smooth to explain everything to you . Unfortunately we have common language which is GO .]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi];W[md]C[China fuseki ! In this case we call it territory China fuseki because the position of B5 is considered to be a low and safe place . 

anyway W6 is a common way to deal with it .];B[kd]LB[pe:a]C[Martin: here is the main problem.
I know from some professional games, that N16 is a good play, expecting black Q15 or a fight like this.
This is the first time i get the fighting answer with this L16 - but i made probably a mistake in direction or in general strategy later on.

***********************************************
Q15 , even in the professional games , you can
see B7 is a common move . I think more and more
players become aggressive . So in that case , Q15
seems little bit too slow in our fast-changing world .
**************************************************]
(;W[oe]C[P15 can be considered . the main approach is to cut-in B7 and B3 . then make the board much 'wider']
;B[qe];W[lf])
(;W[pe]LB[oe:a]C[W8 is bit 'too brave'

usually black can fight back by place at a]
(;B[oe];W[od];B[pd]C[in this example , B9 cut-in white . and definitly white is in a dangerous position .]
)
(;B[qe];W[qf]C[so actually B9 lost a good chance !];B[qd]LB[lf:a]
[oi:b]C[this is really a important moment for white .
because Black 5 exists ,  Q14 might not be necessary . So I recommend a then later b . 

in any case , never make your stones 'heavy'];W[pf];B[nc];W[mc]
LB[oi:a]C[Martin: this was a bad move. I thought about N14 and something around P11 instead, but they did not so appealing. I thought that they are too soft, since black got the territory and is connected when he plays N17 himself.
 What is the main idea to handle situations like this ?
What arguments should me lead in this kind of position to choose the right move ?
**************************************************
Yeah , White 14 is too hurry . usually before start a 
battle , we need to make some preparation . In this case position a might be a good step before starting fighting.

But actually White 14 is not very bad , it is a consideration if you have confidence on your fighting skill .]
;B[nd]
(;C[I do feel White 16 should be at O15 , it is a very important key place . take a look at the variations]
;W[ne];B[me];W[nb]C[the next key step!];B[ob];W[mb];B[mf];W[jc]
;B[oh];W[ng]LB[oe:a]C[bad aji in the black corner 
and because position is sente , so white 24 can jump out .]
)
(;W[me];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf];W[ng];B[lf]C[Martin: when i played N17 it was just because admitting a black play there would be too good i thought, but it took me a few moves (i played a little too fast here) to realize, that white N17, well, just doesnt work ;(.
**************************************************
now the battle is over . big loss in white side . 
I do feel now it becomes a very difficult game for white side]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[fc]LB[nj:a]C[Martin: i thought sacrificing was best, although leaving my O13 stones alone. Since i made a mistake i have to suffer, just how to take the least pain is the question ;)

***********************************
good choice ! although position a might be the more reasonable move . 

now white has to wait for black making some serious mistake :-)]
;B[li];W[pj]LB[ni:a][nj:b]C[Martin: this Q10 os probably an overplay by me, but just O11 looked not so good. A better move than Q10 is heavily needed, which one  ?
**********************************************
at first Black25 is not good . to protect the territory 
, somewhere like a or b is better .

White 26 is a good idea to make the board much wider and wait for the mistake from your opponent]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[qj];W[oj];B[ql];W[ol]C[Martin: black was a little passive here i thought, but im still not out of trouble
********************************
yes 29 can cut white at P10 , it will become a complicated fight then . Surely black now consider the safety first .]

;B[qo];W[oo];B[qq];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq];B[lp];W[kp];B[ln];W[jq]
;B[ko]C[Martin: that is a big price to pay, giving black this big territory on the lower right, but at least, assuming that my Q14 group can live, i have some breath now to make it a game on the left side.
*******************************************
agree !  it is a very dangerous trip for white . 
but this might be the only way to confuse Black];W[jo];B[jn]

;W[mk];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[mi];W[nj];B[nh]
;W[oh];B[mg]LB[lk:a]C[black play quite poor in this trip . finally the white can live  easily and later position A is a turn over point]

;W[il];B[kn];W[jl];B[in];W[hl]C[i think now black will regret .]
)
(;W[oe]C[Martin: probably black could have killed my white group, but if that happenend it would be ok since it was a direct implication of my mistakes before and if i just kept running that would only make the rest of the game a bad trip.
***************************************
So 78 lost a chance .];B[cp];W[lk];B[kk];W[co];B[cq];W[dq];B[bo]
C[in this corner , white should consider to get sente so , L8 is still a attractive place to put your stone]

C[94 should be at 9D];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[in];W[ce]LB[kl:a]
C[Martin: i felt now i have a chance, if i get enough in the left.
Considering that i was 9 points behind in the very end i wonder if that was a right assumption or if i should have given up earlier ;)
*************************************************
unfortunately , white is still behind at least 20 komi. and now the board is 'smaller' . so in my point of view , because white didn't cut at L8 , white lost the final chance to win]
