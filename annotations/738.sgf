C[I don't think my strength differs much from the players in this game,
so I'm flattered to be asked for a review.

I also hope that I'll hear some criticism of my comments, so I have a
chance to learn from the player who requested the review as well!

Thank you.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[fc]C[This makes a solid group
for white, almost alive already.  A very slow move when white has a stone
at D4; I would play around D12.];B[fe]C[This move seems like a mistake:
it's leaning on a white group that's already alive.  Instead black should
play C17 to get life, I believe, with the white stone at D4
threatening.];W[ce]MA[fe]C[I play this move to make the X stone
overconcentrate.

This is a good idea, but I would be thinking quite the opposite: instead of
making black overconcentrated (strong), I would want to attack black by
playing at D12.  Maybe this is an overplay, though ... but with the solid
strong stone at F17, you get overconcentrated too.  Still, taking advantage
of black's failure to play C17 must be a good idea.];B[cf];W[cd]
;B[df]MA[fe]C[now the X stone is overconcentrate

True, black would want that stone one line farther out.  Still, I think the
left side is more interesting (that is, both black and white should have
been looking at the area around D11 instead of F15)];W[qf]C[This looks
like a good direction to approach because the upper side isn't very
valuable.  But I think the left side is bigger, since black is strong there
now.  It makes a big difference who plays around C9
first!];B[nc];W[pj];B[cn]C[Now black gets the key point on the left side,
backed up by the strong stones in the top left.];W[dn]LB[cl:a]
C[i think i
should play 'a' instead.

Yes, this move of yours helps black get the left side, but C8 looks like an
overplay.  D7 might be a good idea though.  Still, if you're in a situation
where D7 is your response to C6, then I think it would have been better to
play C9 in the first place instead of R14.];B[dm];W[en];B[co]
;W[cp];B[em];W[fm]C[right?

If you don't play here it looks like black's moyo will get even bigger, so
I think you have to limit it with this hane.];B[ek];W[fl];B[dj]
;W[bp]C[This
move looks slow: just takes 20 points or so in the corner, in gote.  I
think K4 is bigger (aiming at Q5 next).  Or if you want to defend, defend
solidly.];B[fn];W[fp]C[That feels awfully thin.  Your two stones above are
going to get into trouble.  Black's overconcentrated group in the upper
left is looking very strong now.];B[fo]
(;W[gp]LB[ep:a]C[my very stupid move. i think 'a' is better.

Yes, I think you're right.  But if you're so weak here, you should have
played F6 instead of B4 in the first place.];B[do];W[ep];B[eo]
C[Now you
lose the F7/8 stones and black is happy.  Connecting at F6, if black had
taken B4 you could have made a big move like Q5 and been
happy.];W[qo];B[mq];W[kq]C[Since the group in the bottom left corner is
already pretty solid, maybe R3 is bigger than L3.  L3 doesn't really look
any bigger than the upper side ...];B[qp];W[ro]LB[po:?]C[I don't sure
playing '?' is better.(white is still weak and  black will get sente)

Usually this early in the game it's better to play upward to get influence
in the center (think of it as helping your F7/8 stranded stones).  Your
move takes more territory, but black is looking awfully strong in the
center.];B[po];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[rp]C[A terrible move for black.  This group was going
to live anyway, this move has no effect on white.];W[qc]C[This is a good
idea for white: take advantage of black's only possible weakness.

But after seeing the result, I wonder if S16 would be better.  If black
answers R17 then white can play M17 to pressure the whole
group...];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[nd]
;W[od];B[oe];W[rf];B[sf];W[pf];B[pe];W[pc];B[mf];W[sg];B[se]
;W[rh]C[This looks like joseki, white getting
territory and black getting strength.  But the amount of territory white
gained (in gote!) doesn't seem like enough.  Maybe the original R17 was
an overplay, and should have been just S16.];B[hc]C[Whatever territory
white gained on the right side (maybe 20 points?) black has gained back
on the upper side.  I think overall the exchange in the upper right was
good for black (because black got sente; if white had sente to play J17
or the like then I think it would be good for white).

In other words, white can't afford to spend a move to play T13 or
S12.];W[gd];B[hf];W[hd];B[ic]C[Let's look at the score.
White has: maybe 14 points in the upper left, 6 points upper right, 20
points right side, 30 points lower left, total mabye 70 points.  There's
really noplace where white will get much more than 70 total.

Black has: 10+ upper middle, 30+ left side, 15+ lower right, total 55, but
with plenty of prospects for future growth.  So the key here is how much
white can limit the growth of black's areas.];W[jj]C[This looks like a pretty good reducing move.  Black can't answer at
H10.  However with H,J,K4 all sente for black, and similarly with some
moves on the right side, it may turn out to be an overplay!]
;B[eb]C[Looks
like a nasty attack, but probably an overplay for black.

If I were black I would be thinking more about where to lean on white to
gain some strength for attacking K10.];W[fb];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd]
;W[db];B[gc]C[Oh, I missed that sequence.  E17
wasn't an overplay after all!

Black gains a few points here; white didn't lose much, but the job of
reducing is going to get hard.  That K10 stone is definitely in the right
place, but it's going to get busy for that stone soon!];W[jf]
;B[ie];W[lg];B[nh];W[hg]C[where should I play instead of this move?

I would be more concerned with running away than with running into black's
moyo.  M10, K8, that sort of thing would be where I'd be looking.  This
move is only looking at the ten points or so of reduction that you could
possibly get in this area.  There's a lot more than that to be had down
around L5 ...];B[gg];W[if]C[Another overplay, should be at H12 to run
away.];B[hh];W[he];B[ig]C[Now you are in for a difficult fight.  Black is
strong on all sides...];W[id];B[jd];W[je];B[ge];W[kd];B[ie]
C[now black is even more solid, and you don't have
time to try to fight at L17.];W[kh];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[lf]
;B[of];W[me];B[ne];W[mg];B[ph];W[qh];B[hl]C[This looks small.  The area around L5
looks bigger, since both sides could make territory
there.];W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[gk];W[lj];B[jq]C[An aggressive attack by black!  I guess white can't afford to
hane, though, even though that would be the natural move.  All the
territory in the lower left might
disappear.];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[jp];W[nf]C[Sente, true, but it's very
small.  Isn't A7 MUCH bigger?];B[ng];W[pg];B[og];W[js];B[kr]
C[Why not black atari right away?  Maybe I'm missing
something.];W[ks];B[ls];W[is];B[lq];W[sp]C[The corner is big, true, but
what if black gives up those points and plays B5 instead?  Isn't that even
bigger?  Or B14, that looks very big too, much bigger than this corner.  IF
the P3 stone weren't there, black might have to answer T4, but as it is, I
think black should play B14 or B5.];B[sq];W[so];B[rq]C[But black lets you
take these points.];W[bf]C[It's hard for me to tell whether this or A7 is
bigger.];B[bg];W[be];B[bo]C[Now finally black tenukis a bit to take the big
point.];W[ag];B[bh];W[ah];B[ai];W[af];B[bi];W[na];B[ma];W[oa]
;B[mc];W[km];B[ip];W[hp];B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[rm];B[jl];W[kl]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[lo];W[mm];B[nn];W[mn]C[I count white has
18 upper left, 8 upper right, 5 center, 22 lower left, 16 right side, total
still 70.

Black has 26 lower right, 60+ for the big group stretching from the left
side to the upper side ... an easy win for black at this point.]
