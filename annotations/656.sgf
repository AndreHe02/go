C[Andre: Hi,
this is a real-life game I played at a tournament. Due to time constraints I did not record it to the end. I thought I (Black) had a pretty good game at times but when I tried to attack White's groups seriously I failed and lost.

Tim: White does seem to have used the "never defend a weak group, just keep on invading strategy". It is fundamentally flawed, but quite difficult to punish. You played quite well, but white managed to get away with it.

One thing you should look out for is what the book "Attack and Defense" calls inducing moves. The idea is that if you want to play a defensive move at C, then it is better if instead you can find a move A, which forced white to play B and in turn white B forces you to play at C, which is where you wanted to play anyway. This is more efficient than just playing at C. It is not always easy to do, but you should be on the look out for opportunities when you can apply this. A related idea is the proverb "force before defending". Another realated saying is "the best form of defense is attack". But you should also remember the go proverb "first make your groups strong, then attack."

You could say that playing the middle game well is about choosing the right fight at the right time and then playing efficient fighting moves. It is very difficult, and the best way to learn is to plya games, then go over them with a stronger player. So you seem to be on the right track.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq]C[This move is good.

It would also be good to approach the 3-4 stone in the top left corner. Approaching a 3-4 stone is normally bigger than approaching a 4-4 stone, but in this case your move works well with your stones on the right side of the board so it is as big as the other approach.]

(;B[lc]C[This pincer is OK, but just extending is OK too. (See variation)]
;W[ne];B[pf]C[Good. (white's last move was not necessarily good.)]
;W[kd]
(;B[oc]C[This forcing move is not necessarily correct.

In fact this joseki is one that I have always meant to study a bit, but I had never got around to it. Because of this game I have now studied it a bit, so thank you for submitting this game to me.

In fact there is very little about this joseki in any of my books, and the white jumping out move (O15) does not always meet with approval, and the most useful book I found was Get Strong at Joseki vol. 3.

So this forcing move is not necessarily correct because even after it the corner may still be invadable, also it gives white options (see the variation).]

(;W[nb];B[ld]C[Pushing up here is the wrong order. White should answer at L17. You should push at L17 first.]

(;B[md]C[This move is a bit slow, it might be better to wedge in at N15 instead.]
;W[qc]C[I don't really believe this white move.];B[me];W[mf]
;B[nd];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd]C[This move would be slightly better if it was one space to the right. That would do a better job of sealing off the edge after white defends the corner.]
;W[rc]C[I think that this result is OK for black, both sides have a little bit of territory and something in the centre. The white stones in the centre have a lot of cutting points.]

(;B[ci]C[This is certainly a big move, but I think that there is a more important move in the centre.]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[qn];B[pk]C[I think that this pincer is OK, since if you can cut at M14 you start to build up a reasonable area in the middle. It is a pity that white can jump in to S15.]

(;W[on]C[This jump out is strange. If I was white I would be happy to jump into the corner and take the territory.]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[rk]C[Now black has a nice formaiton across the bottom. It is hard for white to compete with that.]
;B[ed]C[Good, you want to isolate the whtie stones in the centre so that they become a target for attack.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[cd]
(;B[ff]C[This move is a bit timid, and it encourages white to defend his weak stones.

I think that a better plan is for you to cut at M14 straight away. Then white has to run away with his weak stones, at which point you can probably play a move somewhere round here as an attacking move.]
;W[hg];B[fi]C[This is also quite slow, it does not put much pressure on white, and your stones round here are already quite strong.

You could still cut at M14, or you could expand at the bottom with something like N6.]
;W[kq]TR[rc][rk]C[White probably needs to invade here, or he will be behind on territory. But it is quite dangerous. This is going to become a weak group, and the white group in the top middle is also weak, and 2 weak groups is normally bad news. It all comes down to how well you can attack.

The question that you have to ask yourself at this point is "what do I hope to gain by attacking?"

Here are some standard plans:

1) Make territory whilst attacking.

This is the best plan, when it works, because there is very little risk. Unfortunately that does not seem very easy here, there is nowhere where you have a chance to build a really sizable area. It would almost be possible on the right, if only the two marked stones weren't undermining your territory there.

2) Make thickness whilst attacking.

This relies on the thickness doing something useful later, so this is much harder. You might hope that you could get thickness in a place that lets you attack the whtie group around R6, but unfortunately that white group is almost unkillable.

3) Attack to destroy your opponents territory.

Perhaps you can cause the fight to run into your opponents moyo and stop it being a moyo, or perhaps you can build thickness that lets you invade his territory. Here most of the white territory looks pretty solid. The only move that might give you something is C7, but it is hard to see what is required to make that work.

4) Attack to kill.

This is normally a very bad idea. It is very risky, because you have to commit everything to killing, and then probably the opponent lives anyway, and you find that all your attacking stones are too weak, and then you lose the game. But sometimes there is no option. This might be one of those times.

You have got 2 weak white groups to work with, and you did play the moves at F14 and F11 which means that you are strong. So your plan should probably be to chase the weak group at the bottom out into the centre, then play a splitting attack.]
;B[mq];W[ko];B[mn]C[This looks like a promising start.

In this shape it is normally good if you can play the peep at Q7 before this move, but here you probably don't have the time.]
;W[jr];B[ir]C[This exchange probably helps you as much as it helps white, so you are happy.]
;W[km];B[kk];W[cr]C[Andre: I thought this is a pretty unreasonable move, but my "punishment" did not go very well.

Tim: I agree.   White might try to claim that he is making your black group weak to turn this into a fair fight, but that is just wrong. White must play somewhere in the middle.]
;B[in]C[This looks like the right sort of move. Peeping one space to the right might be a little bit better but it is not clear.]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[fn];W[kl];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[nm];B[mk];W[mo];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[jk];B[jj]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[lr];B[mr];W[ms]C[So far the fight is going reasonably well for you. If the white group at the bottom lives, it is going to live with 2 points. You have build some strength in the centre which means that you will be able to attack the white group above, for example cutting at M14 now attacks whilst making territory.]

(;B[ks]C[But this is a really bad move.

You should always try to attack from the outside. Then, even if white lives, your stones will be doing somethign useful. If you play a move on the inside, then when white lives it looks like you have played a stone inside white's territory. Instead, if you play a move on the outside, and white plays inside to live, then it sort of looks like white is playing inside his own territory.

Playing a move on the inside like this is a bit like playing a ladder that doesn't work, i.e. bad. You should only play a move on the inside like this if you have read out every variation and know that it kills.   Well, that is not quite true. You might play a move on the inside to prolong the fight when you can see that that lets you take territory whilst attacking. Simmilarly, you might play a few moves in a broken ladder when that lets you squeeze.

So what I am trying to say is that you should play O1 instead.]
;W[ls];B[js];W[oq];B[op]C[Peeping at Q5 is probably better.]
;W[nr];B[rq];W[pr];B[ro];W[rn];B[qp];W[no]C[Andre: Well, obviously I did not see this one... Big disaster :-).

Tim: Can't you connect at N4? Then you are alive because you can either capture some white stones, or you can play R2 as in the game. Saving the cutting stones is big, because the white group on the right edge is now weaker because you captured the stone at S4.]
;B[qr];W[mp]
(;B[jf]C[Andre: I tried to go all-out to kill the whole White group, maybe just a cut somewhere would have been better.

Tim: you could stil try the cut at M14, but it looks like just capturing the two stones is not enough, you do need to capture this group now. It might be possible, since black is quite strong, but it is not easy.

Actually, I think that the cut is a better way to start the attack, because white's best chance to escape is to connect out to the right, and cutting seals off that line of escape.]
;W[kf];B[jg];W[ng];B[kg]C[Andre: In the end, the White group survived and I lost the game.]
