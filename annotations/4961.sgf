Hi Michal,

My name is Frank and I will be reviewing this game.  My comments will be prefixed [Frank\].

Hope it helps!


A summary:
I think you built up a fairly nice lead in fuseki, but started getting too comfortable.  You need to continue to play your game for the rest of the game.  Instead, you got too passive and your opponent took advantage.  In the end, I would say that it was more a matter of you beating yourself with overly passive moves.  As for advice, I included some variations along the way, but the main point is that if you get a lead in the opening, you should not play as if you've already won.  Just play normal, calm go and you can finish the win.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[qn];W[np];B[lq]C[
When white answers at o4, instead of o3 (should he have done this, since I have d4?) I like to play here, but perhaps it's over-agressive. I have noticed this play occurs often in handicap games by white.

[Frank\] I dont think this is over aggressive on your part.  It may be a fuseki mistake for white, but you should not dwell on it as if you have a big lead now.  White missed some moves to the "proper" play.  See move 10.]
;W[mo];B[ip]
(;W[ql]C[[Frank\]This is too tight in my opinion.  W gets overconcentrated later.]
;B[qf]TR[fc][jc][cf][dj]C[
I now think this was a mistake - i probably should've approached the other corner...

[Frank\]I think this move is fine.  In fact, I like this move.  You can think about these moves and if W plays on the top, you can approach the top left for a double win extension]
;W[jc];B[cf];W[fd]
(;B[dj]C[
Should I have played b16 first ?

[Frank\]I like this better.  3-3 is still open.  This is a very simple way to play and I think B has a clear lead.  Another option is to play D11.  See the variation.]
;W[mc];B[qj]C[
Again, perhaps b16 would be better here, or maybe an invasion at h17, or c6...]
;W[pm];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or]C[
I was quite happy with this result, white seems quite overconcentrated in the lower right, and he doen't have much points there. But i do lose sente, of course.

[Frank\]Yes, I think you've exploited W nicely here];W[cn]
(;B[fq]C[
Would it be better to play c8, since my bottom is fairly settled already ?

[Frank\]I like C8 better...see var.];W[bp];B[cl];W[cq]C[[Frank\]Now D3 will look kinda bad...when you picked F3, you should have been expecting B4 to come.  This sequence is very natural for W.  B on the other hand, seems to be seesawing around two different ideas with C8 and F3.  Pick a plan and stick to it.]
;B[oj];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc];B[pf];W[ne];B[pb];W[ch]

White invades. The result of the invasion was that white solidified her top, which eventually cost me the game. So somewhere here I should have played better...]

(;B[dg]C[
The results after the d12 move didnt seem good, so I played this. I figured since I had c8 and d10, killing the invading stone was a viable option.

[Frank\]My teacher once told me that the most natural thing to do here is D12 (for B in response to C12.  That should be your first option and you should make that move most of the time.  W has a lot more options now...]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[eg];B[fh];W[df];B[cg];W[ce]
(;B[bh]C[

So I have the cutting stones.. Problem is, white eventually got a lot of points at the top.]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[gf];B[dn]C[

Perhaps this was the wrong idea.. i wanted to connect my stones, and start to build a moyo in the center.. but of course it was still open from the right..]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[do];B[en];W[eo];B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[ep];B[gn]
;W[jj]
(;B[hj]C[
Very passive, and probably bad, but I didn't see anything better... The white reducing stone had lots of ways to run (up, down) and white doesn't really have weak groups which I can attack..

[Frank\]Yes much too passive.  See variation.];W[go];B[ho];W[gp]
C[korakael [5k\]: uwazaj na czas];B[jh];W[jl];B[ln]C[
So i tried to play actively, pressuring the center W stones.. but it's hard to make points somewhere there..]
;W[ml];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[nk];B[mj];W[lm];B[kl];W[km];B[kk]
;W[kj];B[lj];W[kn];B[jm];W[kh];B[ki]C[
Probably an overplay I think.];W[ji];B[kg];W[li];B[lh]C[
Panic move :\] I didn't do well in this fight. Also, I was already in byo-yomi, while my opponent had 9 minutes left...]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[mh];B[ki];W[jk];B[lk]C[
Terrible shape of course :\]];W[kh];B[nl];W[mm];B[ok]C[
I should have taken the ko here first, I think.];W[mi]
(;B[ig]C[
Blindness caused by the heat of the battle :\]

[Frank\]Not necessarily...see variation.  I think B is not behind by more than 10 or so...I think you still have a decent chance and should not have gone into desparation mode.  Seeing as you did, it helped end the game.  This is the last comment.]
;W[nj]C[ouigkmy [5k\]: pff lol];B[cc]C[
This invasion cannot work I think...];W[bd]C[korakael [5k\]: shit happens]

;W[pq];B[pr];W[kh];B[hb];W[fa];B[ki];W[ph];B[kh]C[
Well, I managed to have a living group there.. But the game is alreasy over I think. G3 seems a gigantic move by the way.]
;W[qh]C[
Ouch!];B[rn];W[so];B[rl];W[qk];B[rk];W[ri];B[rj];W[sn];B[od]
;W[oe];B[hl];W[hr]C[
So I resigned here. Major mistakes were in the fighting in teh center I think. Thank you again for looking at the game, I'm looking forward to your comments :\]
