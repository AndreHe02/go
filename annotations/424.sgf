RE[W+77.50]
TM[1800]

C[Hello   I would like to request a review of this game. I am ~25 kyu (I think my rank on KGS, where I played this game, is too high as I 'accidentally' defeated an 8 kyu player) and I played black ('wysi').  
I do know why I lost this game - I got pushed around too much and did not stake claim to enough territory. I would like a reviewer to focus perhaps on a) what moves I could have made, apart from those I did make, that could have helped me to build territory (and perhaps crucially when I should have made the moves), and b) to point out any egregious mistakes I did make irrespective of my strategic problems.  
Thanks in advance!  
joe  
Hi Joe. I'll try my best. My comments are marked with (morten), and I've put in a summary at the end.



Hello, morten and Joe. I have commented some of morten's comments, trying to find some points which possibly could help understand the reasoning behind some commented moves.

--Olawi];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[jc];W[pj];B[qg]LB[cj:a][ce:b]
[de:c][fq:d]C[(morten) This is OK. You get the double-wing formation which is good. Other options are C10 ('a'), C/D15 ('b','c'), or F3 ('d'). Personally, I would probably have played D15 ('c')]
;W[qn];B[jq]LB[np:a][nq:b]C[(morten) This is very far. normal responses here would be O4 ('a') or O3 ('b')



Olawi: here, it would be good to point out *why* the move at k3 is too far. The reason is that white can now make a double approach by playing at o3 or o4, and he is backed up by the stone at q 10.]
;W[gq];B[dj]LB[cj:a]C[Joe's comment: It was at about this point when I began to feel that I might have trouble staking out some territory.   (morten) Nothing really bad so far. There are other alternatives as well, which will all give you a piece of the left side. Without wanting to go into specific josekis, the chosen move is OK. Maybe C10 ('a'), one line lower is better Look at the potential territories: two corners each, you have two half sides (bottom & top) and he has a small side on the right. Your last move will make the left split half/half, so you're in the lead.



Olawi: this is only my personal opinion, but I feel that the left side is so open that a more urgent point is to do something at the bottom right. Also, it could be pointed out that an approach at d15 would also be valid strategy.]
;W[ci]C[Olawi: It should be pointed out that this move is weird.]

(;B[og]LB[rj:a][on:b][fd:c]C[(morten) Very small. Your left side stone needs support. In this situation, you really should respond around your lone left stone. Otherwise, there was no reason to play it to begin with.  
If you want to play elsewhere, you should consider S10 ('a') - mostly territory, but also robbing his group of a base, P6 ('b'), also sente towards his right group and pressing his group low while building centre influence, F16 ('c') is sente towards his upper left corner and creates influence and takes territory. The reason your move is small is because white can still happily take away your corner territory here (e.g. by an invasion at the 3-3 point) , and that the move is not sente (white doesn't have to respond).



Olawi: Is this really so small? I think that since this move threatens an invasion at r8, it indirectly reinforces the lower right corner. Also, it makes the invasion at r10 to be smaller than it would otherwise be. I also think that the lone stone at d10 is not in serious trouble since it has plenty of space around it, and the attack at c11 is not too severe.]
;W[oc]LB[pc:a][ld:b][ie:c][kf:d][fc:e][de:f]C[Joe's comment: From here I was hoping to contain white to the corner and not allow him to spread too far.   (morten) This is not a very good strategy. Letting him take this corner will give him quite a large territory, and loose you the equivalent. Your stones are strong - you should attack him. You have four stones in the area against his single stone - it is he who should struggle, not make lots of territory :-) A simple descent to Q17 ('a') will give him the headache of how to live. If he tries to escape with e.g. M16 ('b'), you happily play J15 ('c'), let him get out with L14 ('d') and then approach his corner gently with F17 ('e') or aggreesivly with D15 ('f') . If he had invaded at the 3-3 point I would have agreed with you, but not when he is 2 lines further out.



Olawi: This white move is very bad, and it should be pointed out clearly, as to convince the player receiving the review not to make this kind of move. (Although it was his opponent's) It is good that you stressed that the simple descent is a very good answer and leaves all the problems to white. The player clearly confused this situation with the invasion at 3-3 -point, which you politely pointed out.]
;B[nc]C[Olawi: Here it could be mentioned that the vital point is q17, and black shuold have played there and nowhere else. This move gives white too much.]
;W[qc]C[Olawi: Both miss the vital point. In a review, repeating the obvious is never excessive when the lesson is important.]
;B[od]C[Olawi: Okay, this is the third time, but here it should be commented that the white stones *must* be split apart whatever the result.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[rd];B[re]
;W[sd];B[se]LB[rj:a][rp:b][on:c]C[Joe's comment: Was this move too conservative? Should I have attacked at S17 instead?   (morten) Attacking at S17 would not have made any difference - you would have been captured by White S18. However, this move (T15) is probably not the biggest move on the board. Saving your stone on the left is more important, or extending towards the upper left. During this exchange, your play was consistent with your initial thought - giving him the corner in exchange for outside influence. But was it equal? You have given him more than 40 points (approx. 12 points of territory which was yours and is now his + the stones placed inside what would have been your territory). To make up for that, your influence must be able to create more territory than you gave away. Normally you use influence to create territory in other parts of the board. In this case, you should be able to use the influence you have to attack his right hand side group from the bottom, so that you end up with a large territory at the bottom. S10 ('a') is the right idea but the wrong direction. S4 ('b') takes territory and robs him of the easy glide into the corner. P6 ('c') builds a moyo while pressing him down and building influence.  
However, before you start chasing him into the centre, you should make sure that your lone stone on the left is strong first.



Olawi: It is good to point out that this move is small. (It does not threaten to kill white.)



In my opinion, the reason why this sequence ended with white getting too much territory and black getting a wall in the wrong direction is that the player hanged on into his preconception as to what will happen when white enters his formation at the upper right. Black failed to see any alternatives to his actions, because his thoughts about the proceedings were rigid. This would be a good example of what playing dynamically is all about. White did not want to enter the corner, because he possibly thought that black would get too good a result, and so decided to play a bad move at p17. Upon seeing this, black should have let white run off with a weak group and take all advantage of this situation instead of hanging into his original idea about the usage of his stones.]
;W[rb];B[ja]LB[ka:a][fd:b]C[(morten) This move has no value and gives him sente. If you really want to play here, then play L19 ('a'). But an extension towards his corner F16 ('b') is much better. You should never play on or below the second line unless there's a really good reason to do so.



Olawi: Good point.];W[ib];B[ic]C[(morten) This is the best way to respond to his peep :-)



Olawi: Yes. The reason being that at this stage, the center is much more important than second-line territory.]
;W[hb]
(;B[ga]C[Joe's comment: Not sure about this move. An attempt to limit white on the top.   Could moves in the ensuing fight have been better chosen?   (morten) To be honest, a fight on the second line (involving stones on the 1 st line!) is not worth fighting. Your moves on the first line have absolutely no value. The last move in particular doesn't do anything - it doesn't attack white, it doesn't take territory, it doesn't build influence.... Related to your earlier strategy to give him the corner in exchange for influence, you should be pleased! He takes 2nd line territory (1 point for each move) whilst you build influence towards the centre. Let him do that, it's not to his advantage.  
See var



Olawi: Again, with this kind of moves, it is good to point out very clearly that they are bad and useless. Perhaps a beginner would benefit from a general rule such as 'Dont play on the first line at the opening' or something like that.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[fa];B[fb];W[eb];B[ea];W[fc];B[gc];W[fa];B[ec]
;W[ed];B[fb];W[da];B[fd];W[fa];B[fe]LB[cg:a]C[Joe's comment: This is the end of the fight. White got the territory and lots of prisoners. I later won the corner.   (morten) OK. You have exchanged territory for influence - let's see how you use it :-)  
BTW, the upper left corner in the end is dead (your stones, that is)  
Your move invites him to push you along and taking 5th line territory - he'll be (very) happy. The one stone you are protecting has no real value. You are better off trying to reduce his enormous corner. Try something like C13 ('a') instead.



Olawi: Perhaps it should politely be hinted at that all of the moves in the fight were rather useless, and at any point a move in any of the big points around the board whould have been infinitely more valuable.

The point about 5th line territory is good.];W[ee];B[ef];W[df]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[dh];B[di]C[(morten) Hmm. Again, you have exchanged a very large territory for influence - let's see how you use it :-)



Olawi: And the territory is indeed, very large. It could be said that this is the result of pushing somebody on the 5th line, repeating the point made earlier.]
;W[cj];B[qp]C[(morten) This is very good. The right idea and the right direction. You attack (take away his slide into the corner) and take territory. Now that your left stone is safe, you can attack his right hand group and drive him towards your wall. Don't count on killing him, but just take territory as you push him along.



Olawi: Good point. It should be noted that this move threatens the invasion at r8 and practically forces white to protect his stones.]
;W[ph]LB[ri:a][rj:b]C[(morten) This peep is not really dangerous - you are very stong around here, he cannot gain anything by seperating these two stones from eachother. Since you are strong here, you can afford to be a lot more aggressive - he is the one under attack ! Consider S11 ('a') or S10 ('b').



Olawi: Good point. r8 is a point that, again, should be mentioned.]
;B[pg];W[oh]C[Joe's comment: From here I started to try to keep the side but ended up ceding a lot of the middle to white. I didn't get much of the side either. Should I have tried to keep white on the side, or try to keep the side myself, but with closer attention paid to the white framework developing in the center?   (morten) It's a question of direction. Taking actual territory in the centre is very difficult - you are usually a lot better off basing your territory on a side and pushing or swelling out from it. Normally, you should chase your opponent towards your thickness, not away from it. In this case, this means that you should be pushing from the bottom, chasing him up to the left, whilst building your lower group. His 'framework in the centre' is a group struggling to find life! Attack it!



Olawi: Very well said. The point that thickness is not to be thought of as territory is very important and very often missed by beginners, so it cannot be stressed enough.]
;B[ri]C[(morten) Good, but maybe a bit too late.



Olawi: And, actually misses the vital point, dont you think? The move at r8 is very basic, but in my opinion the best. The difference is that this move does not split white, which is the basic form of attack, and should be pointed out.]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[mh]
(;B[mg]LB[on:a][mf:b]C[(morten) This is the wrong direction. He doesn't want to go this direction anyway. You are pushing him towards his own safe haven, the lower left. Consider the difference between this move and a move around P6 ('a'). See variation.  
If you wanted to push from this direction, N14 ('b') would normally be better as well. Touching stones you are attacking is not normally a good idea.



Olawi: Both good points. The consept of direction is rather difficult, but in this case, it could be said that the idea is to push white in the direction of your thickness (*not* potential territory, as this move seems to imply) and make him weak and make profit elsewhere. It could be repeated that it is difficult to try to turn the center into territory.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[nh];B[mf]LB[lg:a]C[(morten) Since you are strong around here, you can play at M13 ('a'). If he cuts he's caught in a ladder on both sides.  
In general, he is weaker than you are - you should be inviting a fight here.



Olawi: Good point.];W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[lh];W[li];B[lg];W[jg]
;B[jf];W[hg];B[hf];W[if];B[ie];W[ig];B[ke];W[jk]C[Olawi: It should be said that this result is very bad. Black has gotten very little territory and white has turned his weak group into powerful thickness. Why did this happen? Because:

1) Black obviously thought that he should use his wall to make territory in the center, which is wrong wrong wrong and  
2) Black did not attack the white stones using the most elementary tactic, the invasion in the middle of the 3-space extension.  


This result is very bad and a result of invalid reasoning from the black side. Somehow it should be told here that this is a result of invalid attitude towards thickness and the failure to recognize a weak group.]
;B[jn]C[(morten) Nice move.



Olawi: Yes. Reason being that it does something to equalize the balance of power in the center, protects against an invasion at the bottom and threatens an invasion at the right and left.]
;W[km];B[cq]LB[cn:a][mp:b]C[(morten) You're leaving the door wide open for him to walk straight into your largest potential territory, by not answering his last move. If he plays N4 ('b') you will be left with nothing!  
This is a tight invasion. Even though it works, you would probably have been better off just approaching the corner from e.g. C6 ('a') - that would also give you a chance to cut off his centre group to keep at least some sort of pressure on it.



Olawi: I dont think that the invasion at the bottom can be completely prevented by any move. This invasion at the 3-3 is good in that sense that white will do almost nothing with the thickness that will result from it. Also, if white gets to move at c5 before this invasion, it will be very big. This could be seen as an attempt to catch up in territory, which is a good idea, given white's upper left.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cn];B[bo]LB[co:a]C[(morten) Strange play by white. Black can just just push up at C5 ('a')?



Olawi: I think that the white move is okay, it is  a rather new move though. (Go World summer 2000 said that it is a 'new move frequently played by Takemiya Masaki') Black's answer is at b6. I dont think that I am qualified to comment this move, but there must be something wrong with black pushing at c5. It probably is that after playing c5, white will get sente. In this case that would happen anyway. Like I said, I'm not qualified :)]
;W[co]C[Olawi: It could be pointed out that this reverts to the 'classic' continuation.]
;B[bn];W[bl]C[Olawi: This is not too bad :)];B[am]LB[bm:a]C[(morten) Strange play by white. Why not just push up at B7 ('a')?



Olawi: You meant: by black. This is again playing on the first line, and as useless as before. Perhaps something should be said about this habit of black's, very politely of course :)]
;W[bm];B[ap]C[Olawi: Here again.. altough this time there was a kind of reasoning behind the move.]
;W[al];B[an];W[dk];B[fj];W[gi];B[fi]C[Joe's comment: there are mistakes from this sequence (I end up filling a bamboo joint). The idea was to try and connect to the stones at the bottom side. A bridge too far perhaps?  
(morten) The idea of connecting to your lower stones is very good. More than connecting your own stones, you are also separating his. He still has a weak group - although it will live, you can still attack it.  
However, when invading at the 3-3- point, you always give the opponent outside influence, which will make it difficult afterwards to cut him apart...]
;W[gh];B[gf];W[gj];B[fh];W[fl];B[ek];W[dl];B[el];W[em];B[gl]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[ej];B[ei]CR[gk][gl]C[(morten) Leave him those 2 stones - they are a lot smaller than connecting your stones at G9/8 to the bottom group!



Olawi: Good point. Also, plays around the bottom black group and the white group at the right will be crucial. Of course at this point, the most important thing is the cutting stones.]
;W[ek];B[gg]C[(morten)  
Why this move? You are already connected there - it is not sente...? Yes, it is one point of territory, but there are bigger moves on the board :-)]
;W[hk];B[im]LB[hm:a]C[(morten) Better at H7 ('a') to connect up.]
;W[hl];B[hm]C[(morten) ?



Olawi: Indeed. Perhaps the concept and importance of cutting stones has not been stressed enough, perhaps this is a mouse-slip. I think latter.]
;W[gm]LB[mp:a]C[wysi [21k?\]: doh  
(morten) :-) I am sure you can see that this sequence was hardly optimal for you. Now, the tables are turned - he has a strong group and it is you who look thin around him. Now is the time to play at e.g. N4 ('a') to salvage some territory at the bottom]
;B[gn]LB[ql:a][on:b]C[(morten)  
This is small. This is not where the points are. You could still profit from a move at R8 ('a') or P6 ('b'), or the move I suggested just before.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[fp]LB[gp:a]C[(morten) What would you've done if he'd played G4 ('a')?]

;W[cb];B[be];W[ce];B[bb];W[bc];B[ac];W[cc];B[ba];W[bf];B[ae]
;W[af]C[(morten) Contrary to what you said earlier, black is dead. He hasn't got one eye, never mind 2 :-) His stones at B15 are in atari, and even if he connects at A16 white can take them at A18. Even his eye at A18/19 is false since white can throw in at A18.  
Summary: The black opening was OK, but you made several bad choices related to direction. In principle it is OK to play for influence, in order to use the influence to create territory - but in practice this must be followed up - you never managed to use the influence you exchanged for territory. It must also be said that you exchanged a lot of territory for not that much influence. You should be more assertive and not let the opponent do as he pleases. You found yourself in situations where you should have fought harder instead of giving in. Something else which struck me as important was the sente/gote relations. In some cases, you did not answer a move which really needed answering. Your opponent didn't really take advantage of this, but it is a habit you must try to shake off. I am not saying that you should always respond to your opponents plays, but some times, there are move you must make. Similarly, you played several moves, especially towards the endgame, which lost you sente. A good endgame can make 20 points difference, and it is worth staying concentrated, although the majority of the game seems to be over :-) (I do this, too)  
The biggest errors you made were errors of direction. I get the feeling this is because you don't always realise the strengths/weaknesses of your own, and your opponents groups. When I was your level, I read Davies 'Attack and Defence'. Although much of it is at a high level, I still think it's a very good book for middle/high hyu players - it gives good examples of the use of thickness, forcing moves etc. If your local go club has a copy, I'd suggest you give it a look. You should also try to sometimes look away from the board, take a deep breath and look at the board 'with fresh eyes'. Getting too much tangled into a fight which is not really of any importance is annoying and should be avoided. Try to see the areas where there are many points to get - and play there first!  
Good luck with your game - please get in touch if you have any questions on this review.  
Best, Morten.



Olawi: Very good points and very clearly told. Perhaps some major issues should be stressed even more.  


Tactically, black made many useless moves several times in this game. Most of those were on the first line, and this seems like a bad habit. The player would probably benefit from the kind of advice that he should never play on the first line unless he is absolutely sure of what he is doing.  


Strategially, the most important points were the use (or mis-use) of thickness and the failure to spot out weak groups and attack them. These are seemingly very simple points but are difficult to explain effectively.  


Also, the consept of 'direction' is very  difficult to grasp, so perhaps this should be avoided in a commentary like this and try to use simpler terms if possible.  


On the whole,however,  I think that you made very good points about the flow and direction of the game, and made them clearly, definitely helping the player who requested the review in the first place. Personally, I believe in repetition in education, so in a commentary a good thing could be to make 2 or 3 major points, and repeat those whenever applicable :)
