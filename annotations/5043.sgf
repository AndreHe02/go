C[Hi,

Thanks for adding all the questions, I will answer them and add variations where I find it appropriate.

Hello! I am KGS 1d. Playing black.

In this game there was lots of complicated fighting and I did some mistakes which cost me the game, even if I got a good start.

The game was interesting and I felt I was ahead until the final part of the game. I had lots of influence but I failed to turn it into profit.

I felt I played in the correct direction most of the time, but could you tell me if there are some mistakes in my direction of play?

Also could I end some of the fights easier?

Thanks.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[qn];W[ec];B[gd]C[Looks a little strange, after the 'normal' joseki (see variation) you will have a wall towars the right stone, I would choose something else here (playing bottom right is very big).]

(;B[gh]C[This leaves many cutting points, see variation]
(;W[dc]C[Zedi: I feel I am clearly ahead in this point. I have nice walls and I feel saving the 2 corner stones is small in this stage (white's last move)

Ball: Right, although your wall could be stronger, still the game looks promising for you.]

(;B[cn]C[zedi:I also considered Q15 and R15.
Is this OK?

Ball: This does not feel so right, starting to make territory with your thickness like this. See variations]
;W[ie]C[Strange cut from white, does not look possible, but with G12 at H13, this stone would be even easier to capture]
;B[kd];W[je]
(;B[jd]C[Bad shape, you will get in trouble because of this later..]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[ke]
(;B[jg];W[ld];B[le];W[kf];B[lc];W[md];B[lf];W[kg]C[Now K13 at J12 keeps white cut instead of making it possible for him to connect.]
;B[mc];W[hg]
(;B[pe]C[Zedi:Did this leave too much aji? O16 or O14 better?

Ball: Yes, this again leaves too much aji, same as with G12 and K13...]
;W[ne]C[Very strange from white to want to play here, even if he can get out it is very small, seems better to play somewhere else.]

(;B[me];W[nd];B[nf];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob]
(;B[hb]C[Zedi: Trying to live in sente so that white cant play P14 :) Impossible I guess...

Ball: Yes, trying to kill all of his stones here looks impossible. But you have to play something like this, see variation]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[na];B[gb];W[if]
(;B[of]C[Impossible];W[jb]C[I thought I  might have more liberties after w takes my eye and i play Q18... Didnt realize I will have 0 eyes, not 1.]

(;B[ia];W[ga];B[eq]C[Zedi: Now W is ahead I feel, but my thickness will cause W lots of trouble.

Ball: There is not so much of you thickness left, you were strong all over the centre, while now you only have a wall on the left side. The game looks good for white now.]
;W[ep]
(;B[dq]C[You help w to cover his weak point, better not to play here...]
;W[dp];B[fp]

(;W[dl]C[This might be a little too much];B[dn]C[Good];W[en]
;B[eo];W[cq];B[fn];W[fq]
(;B[fr]C[Here you want to take everything, why not give 2 stones away here?]
;W[gq];B[cr];W[br];B[gr];W[gp];B[fo];W[dr];B[er];W[cs]C[Now you have an extra group to take care of and white is not much smaller.]
;B[iq]
(;W[em];B[ho]C[nice move];W[do]
(;B[ck];W[ej];B[dj];W[fi];B[di]
(;W[fh]C[This is too small];B[fj];W[gi];B[nq]C[Very good];W[ek]
C[Zedi: Now I feel the game is maybe even. I should be able to kill most of the w stones in lower part of the board...

Ball: Ok lets see the score, white has about 50 points at the top side, 8 in the bottom right and 6.5 komi, so total around 65 points.
Black has 20 points on the left, around 15-20 in the top right, 10 points bottom left , total almost 50 points, and a lot of potential on the right and bottom side. But white is a little stronger in the centre. Since you are to move I'd say the game is better for you, but not very much.]

(;B[qq]C[Feels too small, see variation];W[qp]
(;B[rp]C[Zedi: Q3 better?

Ball: Yes, give him as least as possible to play with];W[ro]
;B[rq];W[qo];B[rn];W[pn];B[ql]C[Now white is on his way to some eyeshape]
;W[pm];B[so];W[pq];B[oo];W[po]
(;B[nn]C[Too direct, also bad shape for you, see variation]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[nk]C[Zedi: Didnt want w to escape. Maybe overplay?

Ball: Yes this looks too lose, too many cutting points to do something like this here, better to play Q10 and take the points it seems.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pj]C[This looks like way too much];W[qm];B[rm];W[rj];B[rk]
;W[sk];B[rl];W[qh]C[You have eye problems yourself also now, not a good thing to have]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[sn];B[sm];W[sp];B[sq]
(;W[oq]C[zedi: W missed his chance to kill (s2)

Ball: nope... see var];B[rr];W[np];B[pi]C[good move, kill these stones]
;W[re]
(;B[rg];W[qg];B[rf];W[qf];B[qi];W[rh];B[rd];W[qe]
(;B[qd]C[zedi: Is this good? maybe O11 better?

Ball: No you need this move, see variation];W[ri];B[sj];W[og]

(;B[ni];W[nh];B[ng];W[oh];B[mh]C[many cutting points, again you choose a dangerous way]
;W[si]
(;B[sg]C[You are behind on points, so I understand that you try to kill this group, but that seems rather impossible. If you can read that you can't kill the group, better cover on the outside and try to get something somewhere else.]
;W[mi];B[ph];W[pg];B[nj];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[li]C[zedi: Which does not work :(

Why not, you can kill him here if he doesnt take you of faster, right? So I don't understand what white is doing in the game, see variation]

(;W[sd];B[sc];W[rb];B[se];W[sh];B[ra];W[lk]C[zedi: Should I capture right away or make an eye?

Ball: Better make eye here, good chance you will need it later]
;B[mj];W[ml];B[nl];W[mm];B[nm];W[mn];B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[lp]

(;B[mq]C[Zedi: This was a mistake. Misread.
I should play P4 and make a KO for white's life!

Ball: It looks like a ko for both your lives, also not easy, but you can leave it for later, see variation]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[ji]C[So now the game is about living here, if you live here you win, and if you dont, you will have to take the white group at R12 off before white takes you offf, looks like that should be possible]

;B[fm];W[fl];B[hl];W[go]C[zedi: Failed to see some moves and I was low on time so I played badly here.

I lost the game :(

Maybe I shouldnt focus so much to making liberties to my O6 group? I can kill W anyway even if he gets his multistep ko.

Balladeer: Yes you misplayed the start of the semeai here, but I think the mistakes are earlier.
