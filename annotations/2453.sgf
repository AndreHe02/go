C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

I played black in this game. But having several mistakes, so that I lost this game.

I am a territory-oriented player, and I would like to change my style a bit to make me more balance, but I don't when to start a fight, so would you pls show me when is the best time to start fighting.

Moreover, I think I am very weak in ending the game, therefore, I lost a lof of points during the ending moment.

Could you give me some advices to improve these two aspects

Thank you very much.

csh: I think it is too early to worry about your style of playing. Playing a territory-oriented game isn't necessarily a bad style of play. You must be aware that your opponent can gain more he takes the outside.

Learning when to start a fight is more difficult. There is a Japanese proverb, "A rich man shouldn't pick fights." It means that if you are ahead, you should play solid moves and not start fights, since you have more to lose. You should only start a fight if you are behind.

I will also try to give some advice about the endgame.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dp]C[C: This is my first time to use this starting. Because, I just want to have a big fight at the beginning. However, everytimes I just don't when to start a good fight.

csh: A diagonal opening tends to lead to more fighting than a parallel opening. However, it is very difficult to say whether or not there will be a big fight in this game.

Why do you want a big fight?];W[dd];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq]

(;B[hq]LB[fp:B][hp:C][eq:A]C[Q: Should I play H4 to get the outer influence?

csh: The problem I have with H3 is that the potential territory to the right looks rather flat. If L3 was at M4 instead, then I think H3 would be a better move.

I marked E3(A), F4(B), and H4(C). I added variations for these three moves.]
;W[dr]
(;B[cq]C[csh: The corner may not be as important as keeping White in the corner. See the variation.]

;W[cr];B[nn]C[C: Now a good moyo have been built, I think.

csh: Yes, but it has an "open skirt." The left side is still open at H2. O6 is the right idea, tho. It's much better than if White got to play at O5.]

(;B[mj]LB[kj:A]C[C: This is the first step to change my style, this move is never been played in most of my previous games.

Q: Is this a good time to start fighting?

csh: Before starting a fight, you should look at your potential territory and compare it against White's potential territory. It looks to me like you have more, so I don't think you should start a fight. You have a strong position, though, so you might be able to play the double hane at L10(A). See the variation.

In this case, however, the cut doesn't work. White can catch the marked cutting stone in a ladder. Because the stones can be caught, the cut is a bad move.]

;W[ni];B[mh];W[nh]
(;B[kj]TR[lj]C[csh: I don't think the marked stone is going to escape. It doesn't have anywhere to run. Maybe extending is better. See the variation.]
;W[mg]C[csh: White hanes, and it causes a lot of trouble.];B[kh]
;W[lg]LB[lh:A][li:B]C[C: Now, I am considering whether M12 or P14 to expend. Finally, I chose the latter.

Q: Am I right? Or I have to concentrate back on the fight?

csh: I see two possible moves for White, A and B. I added both as variations.]

C[C: Originally, I think the white stones were all dead. However, I made a serious mistake later on, so I lost. I have no comment about me. haha~~~
I havd wasted my extremely good moyo!!

csh: When you have a big moyo, you should expect to get all of it. Usually an invasion or a reduction will reduce the number of points you get from it. In this case, however, you did very well. Almost all of the moyo turned into territory! If you didn't make the mistake later on, the center would be all black territory.

Q: Am I need to take them all before hand?

csh: You don't need to take the white stones now. If you did, it would waste a move. However, you *do* need to make sure that they do not escape. If you didn't make a mistake later in the game, I think you would have won easily.]

;W[oq];B[or];W[po];B[mr]C[csh: This is an unnecessary move. Because you played this move, White gets to play at a big endgame point.

;B[ch];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[ie]LB[hg:A]C[csh: This makes an odd shape. White can cut at H13(A) and cause problems. While White cannot do anything by cutting there, you need to be aware of it.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gc]
(;B[gb]LB[hb:1][ic:2][hg:3]C[csh: I think this move is where the danger starts. White has three cutting points to aim for. Since you are ahead, you should play solidly. See the variation.]

C[csh: Right now, both marked groups have 3 liberties. You don't need to play at K16 or K17, but you need to make sure that you always have more liberties than the white group.]
;B[fb]LB[fa:2][ga:3][ha:4][ia:1][eb:1][jb:2][jc:3]C[csh: Now your group has four liberties and the white group has three.]
;W[jb]C[C: Actually, I didn't realise there was a fatal point at H13, and I just thought those stones at J18 were dead, so I kept on attacking.

csh: Obviously it's a mistake, but you already know that now. :)]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[ed];W[fe];B[dc];W[cd];B[cc]C[C: I think I was too greedy this time. This should play at J13 or H13.

Q: Right?

csh: I think J13 was bigger than this whole sequence. Again, you don't need to take risks if you are ahead.]
;W[hg]
(;B[jc]C[csh: This move uses up one of your liberties. See variation.]
;W[if]C[csh: At this point, you need to read ahead. Can you prevent White from connecting to his group? If so, where should you move? If you can't keep him from connecting, then you should find some other line of play.]

(;B[ih]C[C: At this point, I was frighten and don't know how to respond. But after reviewing by myself, I think I should play at J13 to make KO to live.

Q: Am I right? Or still have any other great moves?

csh: You shouldn't play because you're frightened or because you don't know what to do. It's best to read as far as you can, and choose the best move. I show the ko and another option. See the variations.]

What aspects do you think I have to improve?

Thanks again.

csh: Obviously, the mistake in the middle cost you the game. Before that mistake, I thought you had a commanding lead.

Some other advice:

1) Start a fight if you are behind, but play solidly if you are ahead.

2) Practice reading. You are playing moves before you are reading out the consequences. As a result, you are adding to your losses. Life and death problems and other go problems will help you improve your reading.

3) Don't play unnecessary moves. By playing extra defensive moves, you are missing the chance to gain points in other places on the board.

I hope you find this review helpful. Good luck!])
