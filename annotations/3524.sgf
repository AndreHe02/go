Hi,
I played this game as black, I lost it by 8.5 point, I think I had the chance to win the game, I made few mistakes I am aware, however I had problems to stop the black invasion on bottom, and it costs me the game. Could you please review this game for both side, and show where we did wrong, and tactical mistakes. I put questions and comment along the game.
Thanks
Reviewer: Hi!
I would comment this game for both side.]PL[B];B[qd];W[dc];B[dp]

I guess this is joseki, my goal is to make a shimari on top later and pincer any white stone played on right side
R: Yes, b5 is joseki. But the value of w6 is increased by the next move (x or x  position), but it decreased by the distinction of the next move. For a weak point of w6 is leftside. In other word,  w6(A) and X positions are a set move.　 If white wants only one move, then should select o or o position.
However, this explanation is adequet only in early stage of the game.]

I didn't expect white to play here, but I quite happy he does, is this a white mistake?

I felt it's too small to play one more move to make sure to capture f3, this move m3 makes an extention while putting white corner under pressure. White played E7 next, was it better for black to play there?
R:A is vital point for both side and  you should select the point instead of b21.]

this move is maybe bad... I tried to play some sacrifice stones to prepare the way to reduce white top side
R:As b47 was too close to strong white stones, the the value of the move is small. 
   The squared point is vital for both side.

This is what I wanted, so I'm happy, but maybe there was beter to do, like strenghten the right side?

white only got 1 eye, and my bottom side starts to look nice, so I'm quite comfortable to let white live eventually. I feel uneasy about white l3, but I can't play one move there now]
