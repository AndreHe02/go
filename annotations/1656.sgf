C[I hold black in this game. The game was played on KGS. 



This game was played without komi. I won by 0.5 point. If playing with usual komi white would win. 



I gave some comments about the moves I made. I had difficulties at the start and in near the end of yose, yet the mistakes of my opponent helped me to win by slightest margin.]
;B[pd]C[barvinok [1d\]: hi];W[dq];B[dc]C[With opposite komoku the side that starts gets advantage. This is the basis of Shuusaku joseki in which white makes kakari before playing in the emty corner.]
;W[qo];B[co]C[Low approach trying to be a little bit more territorial. Recently I am more and more for outside influence as things develop later in the game.]
;W[dl];B[fo]C[Nikken tobi to sacrifice.];W[fq];B[dj]C[perhaps too close



klin: This ok, a matter of preference.];W[do];B[dn];W[eo];B[en]
;W[cn]C[Here we go, I could not find anyting better than influence.]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[fp]C[I am not sure if this is correct. Yet it is a treat, so]
;W[eq];B[fm];W[bo];B[cl]C[Perhapb8 was better



klin: This is a normal move.];W[fl];B[dk]C[klin: W F8, B D9 exchanges favor B.]
;W[hq]C[I am not happy with black's shape.];B[op];W[pq];B[oq]
;W[pp];B[oo]C[I don't know joseki here. P5 seemed to be an important turning point. Extension is usefuls as well. 



klin: P5 is an absolute move.];W[lp]C[I think that was too close to the wall.]
;B[qn]C[Horrible



klin: R6 at Q7 safer.  But R6 is playable.];W[po]C[I did not expect this, shows my mistake. I give too much to the opponent.]
;B[on]C[What else?



klin: Once playing R6, B has to play Q6 here.  W P6 cut, B N5 fight.  At the corner, B has Q2, R2, R3 cut.]
;W[pn];B[ol]C[Trying to get ahead and accumulate strength



klin: B lost a lot here.];W[pm];B[ml];W[pl];B[qj]C[Too close to the strength but it seemed to me that I gave too much territory already



klin: B should build center thickness by playing P9, if W R10, B play at K16.]
;W[om];B[nm];W[ok];B[nl]C[klin: B in bad shape here.];W[mn]
;B[nn]C[Horrible group turnes heavy.];W[pg];B[oi]C[I have to try to escape.]
;W[nc];B[oe];W[ng];B[me];W[nf]C[This nozoki was bad IMO. 



klin: W O14 bad move.];B[md];W[pi];B[pj];W[oj];B[ph];W[ni];B[oh]
C[klin: B P12 should R11.];W[nh]C[klin: W O12 at R12 better]
;B[qg]C[somehow my opponent failed to use my weakness];W[pf]
;B[qi]C[Now I see that this is slack. I had to play r14];W[qf]
;B[rg];W[qc];B[mc]C[I am lucky again.];W[qd];B[jq]C[I want to settle the heavy group. Now something like l7 looks better]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[kp];W[jo];B[lq];W[ko];B[kq];W[ho]C[klin: W chose not to fight.  B can satisfy.]
;B[mp]C[Perhaps not necessary



klin: slow.  If B wants to play here, P2 is bigger, and may be a sente.]
;W[oc]C[Seems small to me. 



klin: small];B[hc]C[Now I am not so bad after all 



klin: H17 can play at a higher position, say, H16.];W[jd];B[jc]
C[Very difficult moment. I decided to connect but gave opponent too much in the center.]

;W[fe];B[ed];W[ke];B[ld];W[kg];B[df]C[It seemed a good shape but is I am stong here had to play d13



klin: Either way is ok.];W[dh];B[eg]C[Wrong direction of attack. From the side of the weaker group, stupid.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[ei];B[gg]C[klin: B G13 slow.  If keep pressing at F11, B may kill W group.]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[gj];B[gl];W[fk];B[el]C[klin: B E8 not needed. W cannot cut here. Should play at H7 or K6]
;W[hi];B[gh];W[hk]C[This is a big problem for me. I play for influence at the beginning and the opponent ends up with the center anyway.]
;B[ff]C[Small. 



klin: Very slow.

klin: No comment after this point.];W[ig];B[od]C[small again. It seemed to me that there was some potential in that corner. But I was wrong. MIsread.]
;W[gn];B[pc];W[pb];B[fn];W[ek]C[Thank you very much];B[dm];W[bk]

;B[bj];W[bs]C[Now is afraid of ko gave me a lot of points.]
;B[ai];W[bh];B[hh];W[ih]C[murx [11k\]: L14 :/];B[lf];W[hg]C[Mistake, from the other side.]

;B[lc];W[of];C[Black won by 0.5 point. 



The game was full of mistakes? 

Why does it alway happen to me that while I play for outside thickness at the beginning I quite often gave the center to the opponent. I don't know how to build territory in the center. 



It seems that I gave too much territory in the beginning not knowing joseki. 

Three corners and center is too much for the opponent.])
