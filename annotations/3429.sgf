Dear reviewer, I'd really like to know why i lost this game, I followed all principles I know, but still I saw my teritorry vanishing and my thickness becoming useless.

Basti: Hi I'm your reviewer for the game. I think the problem was not really how you used the thickness. There were a couple of other problems.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ec];W[cj];B[qk]C[looks like it is one line too far, isnt it?

Basti: The wrong direction. Black should play P4. As an extension I think the move is ok.]
;W[oq]C[Basti: White is happy to make the shimari.];B[nd]C[Basti: I think K16 or F3 would be better.]
;W[qi]C[Basti: Very aggressive.];B[qn]C[Basti: Because black can still make a 2-space-extension it is not easy to attack him.]

(;W[pk]C[Basti: Your strenghtening black when you want to attack him. That is not good.]
;B[pl];W[ok]C[Basti: Q10 would be better because there would be no cutting point.]
;B[qj];W[oi];B[pj];W[oj];B[og]C[Basti: A thank you-move.]
(;W[ol];B[pm];W[on];B[pi]C[Basti: White's thickness is a little thin and the black territory is on the 4th line!]
;W[qc]C[i think, when white is able to live in the corner, this result isnt bad for her, but i only got a ko, is there a better way?

;W[sc];B[rc];W[oh];B[ph];W[rd];B[qq]C[Basti: I think P7 is a better threat.]
;W[se];B[rp];W[nn];B[iq]C[my favourite part...
i never know how to handle this kind of moves, its between my corner stone and my thickness, shouldnt i be able to get something out of it?]

Basti: I think A would be a little dissatisfying. White seems to be behind so you should welcome complications.]

Thanks for reviewing.
I think endgame clearly favoured white, and I didnt find any mistakes in fuseki, was the middle game the problem or am I just too weak to analyse a bad fuseki?

Basti: The problems were mainly in the middle-game. On the right you played illogical (move 12) and suffered a bad result. Next you didin't punish black for his greadyness in the lower left.
When playing for thickness and especially when you are behind you should welcome fights but when you had the chance (at move 64) you chickened out. In the endgame you were indeed lucky.]
