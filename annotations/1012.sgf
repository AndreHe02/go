C[Please comment on the opening:  I don't understand opening strategy well, so I would appreciate some pointers.

Hello, my name is Aaron. I'm 1d or so...

I think in the opening you try to find a balance of making territorial prospects
and putting your stones in a good position  to fight.  As always, try to make the biggest move possible, but sometimes there are urgent points that do not seem as big that must be made.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[fq]LB[pj:a]C[This move is fairly normal, "a" is of course
also common.];W[cn];B[ip]LB[jp:a]C[Your move is fine, and this sequence has
appeared in more than a few professional games.  "a" is probably more common.]
;W[kc]LB[pj:a][qj:b][cf:c][mc:d]C[This move is a bit unusual, but I'm not sure how I would respond either. Maybe a, b, c, or d.]
;B[nc];W[hd];B[pg]LB[qe:a][pj:b][qj:c][cf:d]C[I think this move is not very good for black.
If black wants to secure the corner, the move
is probably "a".  However, the biggest point
on the board is often the most wide open  area, and I think b or c work better with black's other stones.  "d" seeks to stop white from forming a large territorial framework.]
;W[qk]LB[qn:a][qh:b]C[This seems like a favorite kind of move for white, who has the option of a or b.]
;B[qn]LB[qm:a]C[I think this is the correct direction to attack,
but I think "a" puts more pressure on white.];W[qh];B[qg];W[ph]
;B[og];W[nq]C[This is a dangerous move for white, because the stones on the right side are a bit weak.]
;B[oq]C[I think this is correct];W[np];B[kq]LB[lq:a]C[I think "a" puts more pressure on white.]
;W[nn]
(;B[ci]LB[cf:a]C[Is this a reasonable move?  How should I evaluate moves at this point?

I think 23 to 26 give white a better result than a move at "a".  See variations.  Although white takes territory in all circumstances, this is only natural, since
he starts with five stones to none on the left side of the board.]
;W[cg];B[cl];W[cc]C[White gets territory and black looks slightly uncomfortable on the left.]
;B[lc];W[kd]C[I think the 27-28 exchange is bad for black.
Black makes a one space extention, which
strengthens white, who now has a strong  two space extention.    As a note, look how much space the white's
six stones are influencing compared to black's six stones.  It's true black's territory is a bit more secure, but white is also fairly safe now also.]
;B[pl]CR[ph][qh][qk][nn][np][nq]C[I was also considering R8 here.

The idea here is that white has two weak groups, so black 29, this move, is the correct idea, to split the groups.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[lo]C[In attacking, you must make your threats real, so that your opponent must defend.

But sometimes we try too hard to actually capture the stones.. or even too hard to  chase them, and end up not realizing much profit from the attack.    I have killed many stones by playing calm moves that keep myself strong and force white to answer, but I have also had the misfortune of attacking too hard, and ending up with little to show for it.

I think it is better to play solidly, in time you will learn which moves are most forceful and effective.]
;B[lp]LB[oj:a]C[I think I would start with "a" here to seal white in (living small), in the process becoming strong on the right.  Then black can use the strength to press on white from the left, which will help the stones on the bottom and left.   That would be the plan at least :)]
;W[mp];B[ln]C[I played this move to make the white group struggle a bit more for eyes.

Having given you my lengthy philosophy,
you can probably guess I do not think 33 and 35 help black.]
;W[ko];B[jq];W[dq]LB[dr:a]CR[ph][qh][qk][ql]C[This move is big for white, "a" might be better locally, however I would be concerned about the group on the right side of the board.]
;B[er];W[dr];B[nl];W[mm];B[lm];W[ml];B[oj]C[I think 45 is a good move for black.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[pi]
(;B[rg]LB[nj:a]C[I think black 49 would be better at "a"];W[oi]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[mk];W[ll];B[mh]LB[mg:a]C[It may be too late to seal white in, time to move on to bigger moves, or threaten to seal white in with "a".]
;W[mi];B[rj];W[qj];B[rh];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[li];W[lh];B[ki]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[lg];W[ne];B[of];W[kh]C[At this point I realized that I had no hope of killing the white group, so I just played for territory in the corner.

Probably the correct idea.];B[kg];W[jh];B[lf]C[White has a nice way to play here (variation)]

(;W[ji];B[me];W[kj];B[jn]MA[lm][ln]C[This exchange coming up worked out badly for me.  How should I have played?

The big white group has half an eye, but many ways to secure others, it also has the sente move at o7 to connect all the stones,
so black 81 really does not have much value.

Black would be better suited to abandon the
marked black stones and make a move that helps the two black stones on the left.

After white cuts you do have some help for the stones on the left, but it cost you a few points.]

;W[kb];B[hl];W[ik];B[if]LB[ei:a]C[It might be better to reduce from the direction of your weakness, the stones on the bottom, with "a" perhaps.

Black 105 seems like a fairly neutral point.];W[gf];B[hg]LB[ei:a]
C[I couldn't see a better way to assault the middle, but it doesn't seem as if I'm getting much here.

Assault is probably the wrong word here.
All you can do here is reduce white, I think I would still make a move around "a".]

C[OK, I know this was a blunder.  Very stupid.

It happens, believe me.];W[ok]LB[ol:a][nk:b]CR[nl]C[This is a subtle point, but if you are careful in these circumstances you may gain a couple of points.

With 178 white captures your stones. It is now your turn to make the biggest move.

White cannot move at "a" to capture the marked stone, because you would just capture him with "b" and save your stones.

On the other hand, if white captures at "b" you can simply connect at "a".. or you can make a bigger move if there is one.

When you connect at "a", you are forcing white to take your stones off the board, eliminating a potential ko threat.

As I said this is a small point, but it could mean the difference in a close game involving a ko.    Realizing things like this are  part of the joy of getting stronger at go.]

;C[So, I lost by about 5 points.  I guess my blunder at N9 cost me the game, but I am sure I could have played the opening better.

Thanks for your comments.

All in all, it seems you did fairly well against a higher ranked opponent.  Just remember to take big points, protect your weaknesses, and attack strongly, but not recklessly.

I hope these comments are able to help you a bit.

Good luck!])
