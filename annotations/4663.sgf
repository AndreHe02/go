C[buckyyowza: Hello Oleg!  Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed with 'buckyyowza'.  I hope you enjoy reading through this review and find my comments to be of use.

Dear reviewer:

 I'd like you to know that I appreciate time and effort that go into reviewing this game.

Some specific questions that I had:

* Move #32: is E4 better?
* Move #44 and later: is there a better way to settle this group?
* Move #68 and later: any suggestions on how to handle the invasion better?
* Move #81: Is there anything that can be done: I think I'm already behind at this point
* In your opinion, what are my main weaknesses that I need to work on most of all?

But of course, if you notice anything else, please let me know :)

Thanks, have fun!

;B[cd];W[cq];B[ic];W[qf];B[nd];W[pi];B[qe];W[ed]LB[pf:A]C[buckyyowza: don't be so eager to get sente.  black is sure to play a gote move sooner or later.  Q14 is important here, and white will have to come back to it to prevent black's upper right corner from becoming unreasonably large for this stage in the game.

E16 is, of course, an excellent play when placed at the right time.]
;B[ec]
(;W[dd]LB[dc:B][fc:A]C[buckyyowza: this should be F17, if black plays D17 now, then he becomes immediately settled leaving white with only 3 liberties.]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[df]C[buckyyowza: see var on #11 for a slightly better position]
;B[nq];W[kp];B[nn];W[qm];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qr];B[kq];W[jq]
;B[lq];W[jp];B[do];W[dl]SQ[df]C[buckyyowza: I prefer D8 to E4, actually.  It plays better off of the upper left group, building a moyo on the left side.  K3/K4 is not really in danger and a pincer makes black struggle more, considering that D5 is a 4th line play and that white is controlling the center in this game.

* Move #32: is E4 better?];B[fp]
(;W[fm]C[buckyyowza: try not to be so passive! Black's D5 stone is very weak here.  Developing a base for C3 will weaken it further.  See var for a rough idea.]
;B[dq];W[co];B[cr];W[bq];B[br];W[dn];B[dp];W[bo];B[gn];W[gr]
LB[jm:A]C[buckyyowza: The result in this corner is a disaster for white; a 3-3 point should secure the corner with a side moyo, but here white is reduced to a side moyo (however a large one) on the left, but has lost most of the center thickness, which was white's main advantage in this game.  White's best bet for the K4 group now is to jump in to the center - there is no eye space on the lower side.  Try a play like K7 to start.  If black plays K7 now, then white's lower side group becomes very difficult.

* Move #44 and later: is there a better way to settle this group?]

;B[gp];W[hr];B[eh];W[ch]LB[fg:A]TR[jm][kn]SQ[df][hl]C[buckyyowza: C12 is good.  Another good place to start is at F13 - to try and seal black in.  However this is a little dangerous for now because the D14 group is not settled and the H8 black stone can cause trouble for your lower side group if not handled carefully.  Further comments about his situation begin on #72.

* Move #68 and later: any suggestions on how to handle the invasion better?]
;B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[ge]LB[cj:A]C[buckyyowza: this is poorly timed.  white needs to protect at C10 to avoid losing a huge moyo!  True, black is not connected out but remember: safety first, attack later.  White's influence around F8 is weakend by the lower left plays, leaving enough aji for black's invasion here to work.  See var for some possibilities.]

(;B[gi];W[hk];B[il];W[ii];B[ih];W[kk];B[hh];W[nk];B[rf]LB[lc:B]
[cj:A]C[buckyyowza: keep playing :-) white's plans have been frustrated by black, but he is certainly not losing!  M17 is still a big invasion point.  If white protects at C10, then his left side is huge and all white's stones are essentially settled.  Black has played a very aggressive game so far, and it is easy to get discouraged by that.  Just remember to remain flexible and it should not be too hard to turn this game into a win.

I would suggest ignoring S14 now, and playing C10 instead.  Black will probably play another move around S14 then, leaving M17 available for white to invade his upper side moyo.  After that, I would say white is winning.

* Move #81: Is there anything that can be done: I think I'm already behind at this point]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[rh]C[buckyyowza:  R12 is simpler for white, and also regains sente if black continues with this sequence.]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[sh];W[rj];B[je]C[buckyyowza: M17 cannot be played now.]
;W[bc];B[fd];W[fe];B[ee];W[de]LB[ef:A]C[buckyyowza: although it looks bad, E14 is actually bigger: either way, you lose two stones, but this way black gets at least 16 points, with E14 it is 4 points territory plus a 1 point sente move at B18.]

[mr][nr][or][bs][cs][ls][ms][ns]C[buckyyowza: good :-)  I'd say that after black's successes on the upper side, and white sealing the left with C10, that the game is essentially over with a win for black - I count a 26 point lead for black (see marked points).  However, there is still a lot of yose and also black has some bad aji in the lower left, so the game is still playable just not very promising.]

;W[fo];B[ep]C[buckyyowza: Thanks for submitting this game.  I always enjoy an opportunity to look over a game, and this one was quite exciting!  In general, I'd say that white played a little too passive in sente, but that defensive play was generally good.  It seems that you play with a good strategy, but have a little trouble taking control of the game to carry out your plan. I'd suggest that some time spent studying tesuji would definitely be of benefit.

I hope you've enjoyed my review!  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions - either via email or look for 'bucky' on KGS.  Thanks again :-)]

In the game, white gets similar thickness, but here black's upper side is divided leaving white some nice invasion points around M17.  Also, F13 plays better off of white's other stones than the position in the game.]
