;B[id];W[jp];B[pj];W[cm]C[This feels over concentrated, and so is a bit slower than black.  O3 maybe]
;B[cj]C[This is a very calm opening for both players, but I think black has the better of it.  Therefore, I don't think he needs to jump into this point yet.  M3 is okay, and G4 is likely a better place to attack something from, K4 in this case.]
;W[mq];B[oq];W[gq];B[bl]C[This move is basically pointless: black can't make life on the side, so this move makes white firm up the corner area without making any progress towards living or running to the centre.]
;W[bm];B[bk]C[Black is no really heavy.  White should look at a play like D9.  See variation]

;W[md];B[of];W[ne];B[od];W[oe];B[pe];W[nf];B[og];W[ph]C[This is unreasonable for white.  N15 is a big cut, and the black group here is quite strong even if the cut were not there.  White is butting his head against a stone wall]

(;B[rf]C[This seems like a difficult way for black to play.  See variation.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[oh];B[pi];W[qh]C[O13 is the only move.  Simply split the two weak white groups, and chase them around.]
;B[nh];W[oi]C[Black playing O12 pushes white this way, and exposes the R9 cut.  Where as O13 so obviously puts pressure on both groups, the R9 cut likely won't enter into the fight for a while]
;B[nj];W[ni]
(;B[oj]C[See variation.  Black can do much better here.];W[mi]
;B[ej]C[Now the weakness of black's plays on the left side become evident in the need to help this group.]
;W[qk]C[The fix on the left is of course paid for by letting white get a really nice cut on the right side.]
;B[rl];W[ql];B[qm];W[pl];B[pm]C[This is where black should stop chasing this white group from below.  Black has made a massive corner through this sequence, but still has more to do to white.]

;B[kl];W[kj]C[White was the one who was weak on this side of the board, but now it is black who find himself under attack.]
;B[il];W[gk];B[el];W[gm];B[en];W[dn];B[em];W[mh]C[White's group is now safe, and connected, and black's centre and left side are still very much under attack.  This basically comes from not letting white take his due on the right.  Black couldn't capture anything, but tried repeatedly, and in the process littered stones all over the board, the N8 stones being the prime example, for white to pressure as he did through the last few moves.]

;W[hi]C[Now if black plays out the seqeunce from before, he loses the stones above L11 in making life.]

(;B[eh]C[Why this?  These stones are not important, and this move doesn't even help the left side group make the needed eyes.  Black should play out the sequence I found for life, but with the lose of the L11 etc stones above.]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[ff];B[hn];W[gn];B[go];W[fo];B[fn]C[This is unreasonable.  There is enough sente in the centre for black to just live, but trying to capture white from the left, just makes white put more pressure on the black centre.]
;W[ho];B[gp]

C[Black needs to stop trying to save everything.  Give something up to make a move that will actually make live for most of the stones.  Black can't save all the stones here.]
;W[hl];B[jn];W[jk]C[DeepTuna [12k\]: That was intense
DeepTuna [12k\]: Thank you
kk1 [10k\]: thank you, great game

[to the reviewer: the game ended here. I played out a few more moves to see where it might have gone. still a close game, but we were quite mentally exhausted after such a long struggle.\]]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mo]C[Because white tried to save the lower side, he ends up letting this move happen. Whats worse is that he tries to resist.  the game is won, but its still bad reading.]

(;W[lo];B[ln];W[nn];B[no];W[on];B[oo];W[pn];B[qn]C[For the most part, black and white both missed opportunities to pressure the others weak groups.  Black was worse off in that one of white's weak groups on the right was treated as if it was quite strong, and white ended up getting a very nice result on the right, even without the centre kill.  

Both players need to also give in to reading ahead a few moves, and see inevitable sequences for what they are: inevitable.  It is bad to continue to play through a sequence you know ends badly, or at least is unnecessary.  One usually donates stones to the other player.  An example of this is black's play with the centre group.  All the moves from L11 up in the centre ended up as donations to white even in the best variations for black in the centre.  This demonstrates another rule: live first then attack.  So try living first, before trying to attack.  once living fails, then out of desperation try this attack sequence.  

Alright, hope this helps.  email me if you are confused at salvor7@gmail.com or try to catch me at kgs or dragongoserver under salvor7.]

(;B[ng]C[This move basically tests whether white thinks he can live above at N18 without defending.  We also get to see if white thinks he can really capture the black Q10 stones.  Its not clear that white can do either, so white, to be safe, should fis the upper side group.]

C[This I think is a better result for black.  Certainly, things could go many ways through this sequence, but black should press on the weaknesses of all the white grous as in this example.  

From here if white tries to save P8, black builds up strength to capture, hopefully, P12, and vice versa.  This is much better than living in a seki in what was black's area of influence.]

(;W[rk];B[ql];W[ri]C[White makes small life, but black gets that thick wall.  The cut at N15 is quite big now, and black's small group on the left is not looking so lonely.  D9 no longer works for white so well for white as the centre won't develop so nicely now.  C17 is looking very nice also.  

In short, white may live on the right, but it is small life, and the centre influence exchanged for that life is worth much more for all the trouble black can cause with it.]
