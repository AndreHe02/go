[di][pi][dk][pk][dl][pl][dm][pm][dn][pn][do][po]C[Thank you for reviewing this game.

My rank at DGS is probably fairly accurate. I've been playing several opponents, and my rank has been improving from 25 kyu to 19 kyu over the last few months. Ryan doesn't play any other opponents online besides me, so I'm not sure what his rank should be. We just try different handicaps and hope for a good game. My previous game against Ryan at this same handicap level was close -  it was almost tied on the board and I would have won by only the 0.5 komi, but Ryan overlooked a double atari at the end and I won by 7.5 instead. Our current game has a 9 stone handicap and I'm losing badly.

I've looked through this game record myself, but I'm not sure what advice I should give Ryan to help him improve his game. Earlier I recommended that rather than starting contact fights against white stones, he should try to loosely surround and separate White without giving me the chance to stabilize through contact moves. Maybe he played a bit too loosely in this game, and that's why I could divide and surround his stones on a large scale.

Please write comments on both the Black and White moves, and point out whatever big mistakes or missed opportunities you see. I've added comments about what I was trying to do with my moves. Some are obvious, but please let me know if I'm accomplishing what I think I am, or if there's a better move to do the same thing.

Thanks again, -Fred


R> Hi, I also play on DGS (as chrisg67)

I've tried to point out some alternative plays for B and W here, it's quite tricky to do both at once so please bear with me :-)

OK, for B in a handicap game you get some stones to start with, what is important is to see them as a whole think of the lines of connection between them as ways of using them together.

For W your purpose is to destroy these lines - split groups apart  attack them hoping that somethnig will drop off, or you can make sufficient outside influence to take a large territory.]
PL[W];W[nc]C[R> Usually a good place to start - the biggest open side.]

(;B[qc]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[R> Is playable, but small - B needs to make his stones work together, 'A' is a fairly normal repsponse and keeps the B stones working together

In fact in a handicap game I would _recommend_ that you play 'A' or 'B' it helps join your stones together.

Playing R17 is a move that helps Q16 live on it's own, and doesn't put any pressure on W]
;W[fd];B[cf]C[R> This is better, compare what happens at the end of the game in these two corners]

(;W[fp]LB[jd:A]C[I always scatter my White stones near each corner at the beginning of handicap games so I can come back to them later and try to develop them in combination with the rest of the board.

R> As long as B plays submissively this strategy should work for you, but what if B plays K17, or K18 next, where would you play? My preference in this situation would be to play perhaps K16, and let B take K4

OK you loose the initiative, but you are gaining some strength to run to with your weak groups]

(;B[eq]C[R> This is usually a good move, *if* B has a stone around K4, but in this circumstance ...]
;W[fq]C[In response to a contact move by Ryan, I strengthen my stone and build a tiny wall facing an open area along the bottom.]

(;B[jp]C[R> ... Interesting, good move ... works well with 4, and challenges F4 to a fight]

(;W[hp]C[I've seen this in pro games, so I guess it's a good way to stake out a little eye space and access to the center.

R> yes, and some usual responses follow in the variations]
(;B[ec]LB[lc:C][cn:F][dn:B][mp:D][iq:A][mq:E]C[R> As B I would probably play one of the marked variations, this move only helps W make a move he wants to make

'A' because it puts pressure on H4 etc
'B' or 'F' because it reinforces the left hand side, allowing it to take on huge proportions
'C' because it threatens O17
'D'or 'E' because it balances K4, whcih is close to W's strength]
;W[fc]C[Again I strengthen my stone in response to a contact move, but this time I've already got a stone at O17 across from my mini-wall.

R> B making contact moves only helps W, this is a thankyou move - B forced W to make a move that he wanted to play.]

(;B[qq]TR[lc][pf][qf][cn][pn][qn][np][nq]C[R> B seems to be more concerned in local strength. Ryan you need to make your stones work together, R3 may take the corner, but ... there's a long distance between Q4, and Q10, similary for Q16.

I would prefer any of the marked places.

Also consider that Q4 isn't under any immediate threat, and moves like R3 are really emergency measures.

It looks like you're on your back foot throughout this whole game]
;W[lp]C[A pincer against K4 to prevent Black from getting a double wing from the lower right corner.

R> Well there's two pincers here M4 is also in a pincer]
(;B[ko]C[R> interesting, but slow and a contact move];W[lo]
C[Again, responding to his contact move.

R> Again B is playing on W's side :-)];B[kn];W[mm]C[Trying to maintain access to the center and avoid getting surrounded inside the lower right corner.

R> Good move, though be wary of the cut];B[om]C[R> Also a good move, though R7 is safer]
;W[ne]TR[do]C[Making a bigger wall opposite my mini wall, and threatening to enclose the upper right corner.

R> And making a ladder work, but still too loose, W has lots of weak groups and nowhere to run to.

B should leap at playing K16 ASAP];B[jd]C[R> Excellent - someone needed to play here, now W has two weak groups at the top]
;W[jf]C[Capping in an attempt to surround K16, or at least make a useful wall if he runs out.

R> Shouldn't work. Even if you get the wall you want, B has undermimed your territory, and you might not even live in that area.]

(;B[hg]C[R> That was a good invasion, but B just gave up too quickly :-(]
;W[he]C[Closing the net.

R> B can still run out at M15, perhaps K16 will die, but it will still be sufficient to reduce W's territory]

(;B[ff]C[R> Good , but can still run out at M15]
(;W[gm]C[Another move copied from pro games. I'm running my lower left group out to the center, and starting to surround the L6 group.

R> This is certainy joseki, but ... D5 looks interesting too, B has omitted D6.]

(;B[km]C[R> a tad slow, L8 should be possible];W[lk]LB[le:G]
[qg:E][jk:C][il:B][cm:D][km:A][mn:H][nq:F]C[Staying ahead as he runs.

R> These knight moves are all very well, but they can be cut. The cut relies on a ladder, which works for B

B has the next move, so lets have a look at the biggest areas on the board

The Stones at A are in trouble, so a move at B or C is quite big in the current running fight

D would help reinforce the left side

E would do the same for the right

F would put some pressure on the M4 group

G would help to rescue K16, or reduce W's top area

H would cut W apart at the bottom... though with the 'A' stones in danger this doesn't look so hot.]

(;B[gk];W[il]C[Closing the net.]
(;B[ij]C[R> It looks like B is too willing to believe that W has killed his stones]
;W[jk]C[I start a contact fight and seal the connection between my two groups.]
;B[jj];W[kj]C[Use the Tiger shape connection to reach toward my group at the top.]

(;B[kh]TR[pf][qf][cn][dn]C[R> This doesn't do much, B needs to think about reinforcing his territory now, any of the marked moves would be good]
;W[lf]C[Close the gap.];B[og]C[R> Again very high like P7, S13 make look submissive, but is more solid]

(;W[cn]C[Invade the largest open area on the board, and isolate the lower left corner.]

(;B[dn]C[R> Another contact move, this doesn't look good for B

Try something like C4, or F2

Or more importantly, try and connect this stone out earlier, you had a few moves in the centre where you could easily have played D6 sooner]
;W[dm];B[em]
(;W[en]C[Punish the double hane.

R> The double hane was an overplay, but ... so's the punishment, see variation]
;B[do];W[el]
(;B[co]C[R> See variation];W[fm]C[Not sure what I would have done if he hadn't allowed me to connect here.

R> So the "punishment" wasn't that good ;-), and c6 can still be chopped off]

(;B[mi]C[R> This move doesn't make any territory for B, or cause any trouble for W, making these moves just gives your opponent a free choice where to play next]
;W[oq]C[Jump into another large open area and stake out eye space in case I'm cut off here.

R> and this breaks the ladder, but not really a large open space,  B 10 or R7 look interesting]
;B[no];W[of]C[Going on the offensive to strengthen my stones and reduce Black's side territory.

(;B[pf];W[pe];B[qe];W[oe];B[qf];W[ng];B[oh];W[qk]C[I don't have much experience invading and making a living group, so I decided to practice here. Since Black is on or above the fourth line, I thought I might have enough room to do it.

R> Looks like a reasonable start, yes B played too high with P7 and P13, would you have tried invading if they were at S7 and S13?]
;B[nk];W[qn]C[Can this White group be killed?

R> I wouldn't say it was alive just yet]
(;B[mp];W[mq]C[Staying connected.];B[lc]C[R> A little late for this, you needed to continue with your invasion earlier]

R> Yes, B should avoid making contact moves - they do exactly the opposite of what you expect. They don't damage your opponent, they reinforce your opponent - by forcing them to ad stones, thereby gaining liberties]

(;B[ji]TR[ij][jj]C[R> This move only damages B, making the famous empty triangle ... how many liberties has it got now?
how many before this move?

Avoid making the empty triangle it is naturally short of liberties, without the W stones around it it has 7 liberties, whilst 3 stones in a line have 8 liberties. It doesn't sound much, but every liberty ocunts in a fight.]

A5 doesn't demand an answer from W, so W can play else where.

R> Right let's see what the main points are: -

For B: -
o   Making contact moves forces your opponent to stengthen his stones,
     so is not normally a damaging way of attacking. 
     There is a proverb - "attack from a distance" which covers this quite well
o   Making inefficient shapes (empty triangle), is an easy way to loose a fight.
o   In a fight situation don't automatically atari, and be aware of making moves
     which give your stones less liberties.
o   You made some good invasions in this game, and then were all too happy 
      to give them up. If you're going to invade  ... have faith in yourself and continue
      down the road you've started - pull those stones out - don't try and let them 
      live on their own.
o   The player with the most groups is the player most likely to loose a group 
     (you can't defend everywhere at once).
      - Connect your stones together
      - Keep your opponent's stones apart (where possible)

For W: -
o  Keep an eye on the 3-3 point for invasions - learn one or two ways of invading 
     at the 3-3 point.
o  Be aware that the knights move can be cut, and that it involves a ladder.
o  Atari does not mean sente, your opponent can give a stone or three up to make 
    more points elsewhere.
o  Don't make lots of weak groups at the outset of a game, you'll eventually end up
    playing lots of defensive moves.

For both: -
Enjoy your games :-)]N[RESULT])
