(;B[dp]LB[oe:a][pe:b]C[RB: Here I decided to take the last corner rather than answer the approach. I'm not sure how wise this was. In the end I managed to make it work okay, but it cause me plenty of concern.

-playing on (a) or (b) would have put white in a situation where he would have to answer, though. (b) would be a joseki, i think (see var). whereas (a) would make for influence on top for black.

but playing into this empty corner is very big and you can still put up against white if he plays on the top right one...
i think it is a matter of taste if you take the last corner or reply.]
;W[nc];B[pe];W[pf];B[oe]MA[nc]C[- rembember the last variation: white's marked stone  is on the vital point of this shape.]
;W[ld];B[jp]MA[pf][qe]LB[qj:a]C[RB: Here again I decided to risk this corner by taking the lower start point rather than making good an escape.

-loosing this corner would be very big, though.
perhaps you should play around q10 to attack the marked white stones, preparing to escape or live with your corner stones.

if you really accept to loose the three corner stones then you should avoid to add more stones to them and play from the outside (see later on).]
;W[qi];B[dj];W[cn];B[gp]LB[dn:a][en:b][cp:c][cl:d][cf:e]MA[dj]
C[RB: In hind sght,I wonder if I should have played at (a) here and played more aggressively. Was this the beginning of my furture problems on the right side? I'm just curious if I could have used the marked stone to put extra pressure on white early.

-not necessary contact play like (a).
consider (d) or (b) or extending with the marked stone towards white's top left corner and simultanously attacking it with (e).  even shutting the corner with (c) is an option here. you will have to strengthen the marked stone later on then.

your corner stones is stronger than your lone stone on the left. so you should consider to play from there.]
;W[ck];B[dg]LB[cj:a][dk:b][dl:c][el:d][em:e]MA[pk]C[RB: Would (a) have been stronger? I guess I was trying to make some sort of framework here.

- (a) would of course hinder white from extending towards the top.  i would also consider (b), (c), (d) or (e).

(b) would be rather slow but as effective as (a). keeping white low on the left and working together with the buttom stones.

(c) would leave some cutting pottential in white's flavor but is faster than (a) and attacks the white stone little more.

(d) and (e) would extend the buttom-framework.
consider playing around the marked position on the right side afterwards.]
;W[fd]MA[fl]C[-you should strengthen your weak stones on the left since white is building sort of a pot around the two black stones on the left...
(consider white playing on the marked position.)]
(;B[qm]LB[ci:a][el:b][em:c][ce:d]C[-with (a) trying to build up livingspace.

(b) or (c) going for connection with the buttom group.

(d) extending the basis.

if black could play a sequence constiting of (a) and (d) would be very good.
(see var for some ideas.)


i.e. the two stones on the left are too weak to be left alone (like the top right corner).]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[fo]
(;B[co]LB[do:a]C[-d5 threatens to cut at e6. the resulting ladder seems to work for black.
still think about your two weak stones on the left!
the pot's walls are getting even higher...];W[do];B[bp];W[cj]
C[RB: Ouch! I regretted not play here.];B[jd]C[RB: I felt I had to try to reduced the top before it was too late. But, I was less than condident about this move.

- your stones in the right top corner are very weak, so are the stones to the left. seems so as this stone has no place to run to later on...
better do something about your weak groups before attacking anywhere else.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[mf];B[of]C[- this will do no good. it doesn't help you anyhow and helps white to build up a wall which helps capturing the two black stones just played.

one cannot fight on two fronts and suspect to win on  both (if the groups on both are weak).]
;W[pg];B[og];W[mg];B[qd];W[rf];B[oi];W[jg]C[RB: This may have been what ultimately hurt me in the left side. Frankly this is where I feel I struggle the most - knowing when to head for the middle. I don't think I ever recovered from this one.

- you always have to consider where your and your opponent's territory is. to me it seems quite balanced. though black has more weak groups.]
;B[qk]C[RB: I decided to pressure white's group on the right beofre trying to live on the left.


- you'll have to think more about what's more important. and i think living(?) or escaping on the left side is bigger...]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[ie];B[lc]C[RB: with no options open in the middle for this group now, I fight for life at the top.

- there is virtually no way to live here.
better play from the outside, not adding stones to be captured for the opponent.]

(;W[md]LB[mc:a]C[- if white attacked more severe, black would have had hard time to live, i think.]

(;W[hn]C[RB: Though I didn't see it at the time, this seems to be where I missed my last chance to escape. If I had played here, I may have lived on the left.


- see variation for some ideas.

with this move white widens his territory. if you played there so would have you (possible connect or at least reduce a great deal).]

(;B[dk]C[RB: I felt I needed this extra stone before heading off towards the middle.

- when i am in such a situation, i always think about abondening such stones.  pretending to try to rescue them, meanwhile reducing opponent's territory from the outside is that way of playing.

before that you'll have to check the balance of territory.
this seems equally here (if the reduction works, i.e.). both players have set up big frameworks.
a little reduction and strengthening the own position could win the game for black.

so, where to play?
see variation for an idea.];W[dm];B[gk];W[jj];B[jn]LB[im:a]
C[- that's somewhat slow. (a) (white played there) would be better for black also... you still can try to connect or at least pretend to.]
;W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[ci]C[RB: Decided to try live at the edge since connecting in the middle seemed hopeless.]
;W[bi];B[ch];W[cf]
(;B[fm]LB[ll:a][kl:b][lk:c]C[RB: White shut me down quickly on the left edge. I decided to push make what I could of a framework with the space left to me.

-consider this:
as i already wrote, the board seems to be cut into two equally big parts: the left top for white, the right buttom for black (also considering the living group on the top).

playing (a),(b) or (c) seem to strengthen the situation. (i'd play (a), just for the fun of seeing white cutting at  l7.)]
;W[go];B[cl]C[RB: I thought that cutting off these stones would be a fine way to live. Hmmmm . . .]
;W[bj];B[fh]LB[gg:a]C[RB: Would (a) have been better here?

-well, it creates a bigger framework. but that is still left for battle.
this way it leaves less space for reduction to white (the stones are connected better i.e..)

but it's hard to life enclosed like that...

i think supposing white playing properly, black will have virtually no chance to live here. at least one should not hope for bad play on opponent's side...

if you can live it will be a very small life but reducing white's territory quite a bit.  well, ok, you'll have to try...]

C[-connect with d8!?];W[gj];B[fj]MA[ck][cj][bj][bi]C[RB: I think white already saw that he could force me into a killable shape at this point. At least it felt like he could already see it. I was still hoping rather than seeing :-|

[fj][fk][gk][ek][dk][dj][ci][ch][dh][dg]MA[bn]C[RB: I decided to try one more time to save the marked group.

;B[kb];W[je];B[oa]TR[kb][mb][nb][mc][lc][jd][jc][ib][hb]LB[bh:a]
MA[cl][cm][bm][dl]C[RB: I played here because I was less than sure that the marked stones were alive. And I was under time pressure to decide. I think they may have been alive without this move. Hmmmm. . . I had been looking at (a) for the past several moves knowing that I needed to make this move.


- yes, white could connect there.  but you have a weakness at d8. so white will connect (with (a)) or the marked stones be cut off.   it seems a good idea to connect with the move you just played.
 since as you can see on the group to the left: connectedness is a very important concept in go.]

you should try to keep the option of connecting stones or groups to each other. connected stones are much stronger.
take the invading stone on the top as an example. he had no really good way to go.
you should first establish some stronger group an invading stone could get to if you can see that it alone will not be able to live.

you should stick more to stones you played and not always reply stones your opponent played at once. e.g. the corner stones on top right should have been strengthened more severe so are the two stones on the left. they've been very lone and you left them, playing elsewhere.
if you change your mind all the time, you'll get many weak groups of stones.

and you should make use of the option to play from the outside.
