C[Rex: Thank you for taking the time to review  my game. I am playing white. I have put in  some questions preceeded by my name. In  addition to these 4 questions could you  please see if you can spot a couple of  general tendancies I have throughout the  whole game that I should be aware of.  Thanks again.]
;B[dq];W[pp];B[co];W[pd];B[dd];W[jp];B[hp];W[iq]C[Rex: I played this move since I was fairly  sure he would play H3. I have 3 reasons for  this move. 1) It strengthens the K4 stone, 2)  I wanted sente coming out of here, and 3) I  was afraid if I did not play J3 and played  tenuki, B would pincer my K4 stone which  would cause me problems.
   Now, I know this strengthens B which  negates the possiblily of reducing by  playing F4 or thereabouts and have read  that you should keep your options open as  long as possbile.
  But could you explain, shortly, why the  gain in territory is less valuable then a  nebulous possibilty.
   Sorry this was so long. The other 3
questions are not.

Kirk: I think that, from a whole-board point of view, Q10 would have been better, or even D10 or D11. But, since you are a relative beginner (and your opponent is as well) you can safely play this move. As you say, you were pretty sure he would reply with H3, and he did. A stronger player might not have played there. I could see R7 as being a good move, and sente, forcing you to reply. If B plays a sente move, and you reply, he can always come back to H3. B has a huge gote move at D10 as well...]
;B[hq];W[fd]C[Kirk: This move gives B exactly what he wants - the left side. A move around C11 would have split B some.]
;B[df];W[jd];B[qj]C[Kirk: W should have played here first...]
;W[qm]C[Rex: I believe this is the correct direction to  pressure from rather then at R13. Is this  right?

Kirk: this is good, but a bit weak. B can ravage your lower right corner easily. But, again, remember the level of your opponent and take more chances.]
;B[qg];W[qe];B[qq]C[Kirk: see? If you had played R6 you might have been able to stop this. But it's not that big a loss....]

(;W[qp]C[Kirk: you should have played the other side... see your comment later.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[rp];W[ro]
;B[sp];W[so];B[rr]C[Rex: Looking at it after the game, I now  believe I should have created my wall  facing the left since the 2 B stones on the  upper right negate the thickness of the wall.  Correct?
  I just made a variation beginning  on move 18 exploring the wall in the other  direction, and it looks much better with more  possibilites. I guess I just answered my  own question. Any fault in the reasoning?

Kirk: you answered your own question. :-)];W[cj]C[Kirk: Now, with the D14 stone, this is less effective.]
;B[ci];W[cm];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[em];B[fl];W[bi]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[bg];W[bn];B[bo];W[bm]C[Rex: I played here thinking that if B played  here I would be in real trouble. I don't think  he can kill me but surely enclose me on the  side while getting strong influence in the  center. Is this correct?

Kirk: I would have played F7. It's much more important to get out inte the middle.]
;B[gn];W[in]C[Kirk: you could still play F7. If he blocks at G7, you can cut at G8 and threaten his wall. It is weak, and has several cutting points.

If you want to make territory from the bottom, N6 would be much bigger.]
;B[gg]C[Kirk: huge move...];W[eb];B[db];W[ec];B[dc];W[mc];B[of]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[pk]C[Kirk: Excellent thought! You have him running in the right direction. He gives you the game here.]

C[Kirk: A waste. Look at how big G10 is? Much bigger than losing one stone. You must learn to let go of your stones.

F10 is risky, but you could do damage. Push at G7, cut at G8, cut at D11... and see what he does.]

;B[nj];W[kj];B[ki];W[kk];B[qc]C[Kirk: That's bad. Instead of playing small moves in the center, you should have played S14, then R17. Look at the whole board, not where the action is ...]

You're welcome. Best of luck in future games. If there is one lesson to be learned: look at the whole board, find the biggest move at all times.]
