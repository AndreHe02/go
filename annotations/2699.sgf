C[Dear reviewer.
Thanks a lot for your time in advance.
I played white in this game.

I felt quite comfortable in the beginning. But after losing the Ko, I thought I felt behind.

Please can you tell me where were my basic errors. I am mostly interested in the beginning and the middle game. My endgame was poor.

regards
Peter (go4fun)

dear reviewee,
i enjoyed reviewing this game.

too many of your sequences end up giving away stones to give your opponent strong shapes. this is one of your biggest problems. see moves 44, 140, 150, and 180. having a sense of sacrifice is good, but these are places where you give away key stones that make your opponent strong, when you didn't need to. if you try to change this feeling you will get much stronger.

missing a couple of life and death problems could have turned the game around, so i suggest that you study some basic life and death.

cheers,

this is a good cut for white. black cannot hope to save both sides without a white mistake]

yes. that would have killed. this is the second time you've missed a life and death situation unfortunately =( each time would have earned you 35 points -- probably enough to win the game.]
