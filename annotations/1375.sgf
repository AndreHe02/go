;B[cd]C[Hi.I'm about 5k but I want to know how good I am.So I play with 1 dan.
This game I want to know my opening.
M18 stone is it good or bad and I want to know how to attack the  middle left white stone.
After white P14 I think I should play at N14 and I like to know my  mistake in the others spot.
Thank you very much.For review my game.];W[pq];B[pc];W[cp];B[ed]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pg];B[nc];W[qk];B[ep]C[I definitely think C10 is bigger for black than this  approach.  The pincer, which is at the same time an extension from  Q3, gives white an easy attack. I think F3 is a better approach if  you want to play this side (easier to settle).]
;W[dn]C[I think white should pincer, to make use of the Q3 stone.]
;B[iq];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[eo]C[this seems slow.  If white cuts, you can give up the E4  stone.  C8 or C11 is bigger, or maybe M3 area if you want to defend  this group.  E5 is unnecessary, therefore bad.

The important direction is the side.  E5 is heading into the center.  Better to treat E4/F3 as light stones.]
;W[fr];B[gq]C[white gets a big corner here.  E5 looks even less useful now.]
;W[cj];B[qo]C[again black approaches a little too close, a little too deep.  R4 is a severe attack on this stone since it is already pincered by  R9.  Black should play Q5.  Also maybe C12 is bigger (threatening  C8).]
;W[op]C[I think black can now settle by attaching at R3, so this  looks slow for white (is white trying to attack black's J3 group?  Silly!)]
;B[pl]C[a stylish move.  Drawback: white's weakness at R11 is fixed.  Advantage: maybe black can be first to play around N3.]

(;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn]C[these look like mistakes for white.  Now black is strong  here.  White only gains a few points, and R11 still looks  interesting.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[pk];B[mo]C[a bit aggressive: how will black answer white O6?]
;W[mq]C[white should cut and fight, I think, this is a bit submissive.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[ch]C[you can't leave an exchange like P9-P10 on the board!  If  white plays O9 now, your P9 move turns into a huge mistake.  You have  to follow it up at O9 or O10.

C12 is a big point, but the time to play that would have been before  your invasion of the lower right ... or just leave the P9-P10  exchange out.]
;W[ej];B[eh]C[Another slow move.  O9 or O10, for sure, but also the upper  side is bigger.  White doesn't gain much by playing E12, so you don't  have to prevent it.  J16, maybe, would be my third choice after O9 or  O10.]
;W[gc]C[white P9 looks very, very big.  More urgent than G17, which  is also big.]
;B[fc];W[gd]C[D17 is still open, so F17 is rarely a good move in this type  of position.  Black can usually gain a lot more with J17.

In this particular situation, though, it seems like this might be a  reasonable direction for black to be pushing.  White's strength is  canceled by the strong stone at O17.]
;B[dk]C[this looks overly aggressive; white played E10 to defend this  area.  But you do have that move at E5 that you want to try to turn  into a good move. White has some weaknesses, but so does black.  On  the whole I'd say it's an overplay.]
;W[dj];B[dm];W[en]C[white chooses to fight ... probably the right thing to do here.]
;B[fl];W[gj];B[jc]C[good, now black maybe gets a good double-attack going.]
;W[he]C[looks a little slow for white.];B[fk];W[fj]C[This exchange seems to help white more than it helps black.]
;B[fn]C[The big direction is G12, splitting white's two groups.  Now  white plays around there and links up, and black's attacking  potential is gone.]
;W[cn];B[em]C[why answer this way?  Doesn't B8 keep white separated?  I  suppose you're focusing more on defense than attack here.  But you  shouldn't be able to win with a move like this.  White can link up  now.]
;W[kd];B[kc]C[instead of handing black the upper side like this, I'd play  around G12, link up, then invade M17 if I were white.]
;W[ld]
(;B[lb]C[M18 is not good, should be M17.  Taking away liberties of  those two stones will make a big difference if you later try to push  up at K16 and cut L15.

If you want a more stylish connection, play N17, supporting a jump  out, splitting white's group on the O15 side instead.]
;W[jd];B[ne]C[see variation for the better shape black could have at this point.]
;W[nk]C[this is a big point, but I think the biggest move for white  now would be G12 or in that area, linking the two weak groups  together.  This move is also good, though; it weakens black's group  here and gets more center strength for helping white's weak groups.]
;B[lp]C[I still wonder how black will answer O6.];W[lq];B[kp]
;W[ol]C[This is slow for white.  If black connects, you can play N10  if you like.  O6 is sharper.]
;B[nn]C[black gets O6; this looks like a good game for black!  Now  white has weak groups, black has none, so black can attack (on the  other hand, black does need to be careful of white's strong stones at  O9.]
;W[of]C[a very slow move.  White seems to think he's way ahead.  Again, G12 looks better, or for a center play, J9 perhaps?

Is white aiming at P16?  STill seems slow.  P16 doesn't really work,  because white ends up short of liberties (see variation)]
;B[gg]C[black separates white, so now there's some good attacking  potential.  But with the link-up of B8 possible, maybe it's just a  bit too slow, so I think you're right about N14 being a key point (to  cut off the other group, and to prevent white from getting center  territory too).]

(;W[mf];B[il]C[a slow move.  After playing E7 to link up, this move oes  nothing but take a bit of center territory, and with O9 and P8 on the  board, black's not getting much here.  There are plenty of  territorially bigger points on the board (B8, S3 even)]
;W[kq]C[This seems slow for white again.  B8!!]
(;B[jq]C[Is it really necessary to answer white here?!];W[jk]
C[white looks like getting a lot of center territory now.];B[jl]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[ig];W[kf]C[white defends solidly like this: white thinks he's leading.  L12 might be better (for defending the center territory)]
;B[bl]C[Now it's too late, K9 being on the board, K11 takes territory  and defends white.  Earlier, B8 would have had some more attacking  meaning.]
;W[bm]C[force before defending (black has to answer this, otherwise  white can omit K11).]
;B[cl];W[hh];B[hg];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj];B[gk];W[ll]C[N7 instead?]
;B[kn];W[jh];B[ii]C[mistake.];W[ih];B[jg];W[kg]C[now white will win unless black can do something big at the top group.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[me];W[lf];B[fe];W[fb];B[eb];W[fd]C[bad move for white, eliminating the D17 potential.]
;B[ec];W[bh];B[bg];W[bi];B[cg];W[gh];B[fg];W[ic];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[jb];W[jf];B[gr];W[er]C[white does not need to answer here for life, does he?  If  not, S14 is bigger than answering at E2 (G2 was fine for black).]
;B[lm];W[mm]C[small!  S15 is much bigger.];B[np];W[nq];B[mn]
;W[rp]C[This one is big too.];B[sp];W[sq];B[so];W[rq];B[sl]
;W[rl];B[sm];W[sk];B[oo]C[not necessary, so S15 area is bigger.]

;W[ah];B[be];W[jr];B[ir];W[kr];B[ci]C[white seems to be getting all the big endgame points.  black  needs to look for whenever it is possible to ignore white and take a  bigger point elsewhere.  Yes, white's move looks like sente, but  count how big the threat is and see what you can do in another part  of the board.]

;W[pd];B[od];W[pf];B[nb]
;C[I would say black needs to work on endgame quite a bit.  If  you're 5 stones weaker than white really, as you suggest in your  opening comment, about two of them come from endgame: following white  around the board, answering every sente move instead of making a  threat of your own somewhere else.  White gained 15 points or so  during the end of this game.]

(;B[bl];W[jp];B[jq];W[jo];B[km]C[I don't see white escaping with those two stones, do  you?  So K3 was unnecessary, B8 instead.]
))
(;W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[ob];W[pb];B[qb];W[pd]C[white has to play here to prevent black P15.]
;B[pa]C[and now white has no more threat.  SO P14 is indeed  slow.  If W wants to jump out, just play N13 or so straightaway.]
))
(;B[lc];W[jd];B[md]C[compare this with the funny shape you ended up with in the game.

For example:
If you play M15, then J16 is a threat ... in the game, white's extra  liberty means there's no worry about J16 at all.]
)
(;B[mc];W[jd];B[ne]C[black's attacking chances might be better this way.  Also white will have trouble cutting ...]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[md];W[me];B[oe]C[white is short of liberties on this side.]
))
(;W[pk];B[ol];W[rm]C[This variation avoids strengthening black so much  (still white threats at Q6, for instance)  If I were white, I would  play this way.]
