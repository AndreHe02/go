C[Koosh: *Hello to the person reviewing my game for me ^_^ I'm going to make some random comments as to my line of thinking.*

Hi, I'm Peter. I hope, that I can help you by giving some suggestions. Enjoy!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[ld]LB[fo:D][cq:B][dq:C][hq:A][jr:E]C[Too slow. The three W stones are too close to be efficient and the gap to the left is too big. You've build up a group that you are now bound to and that's too early.
The B position at the bottom is more balanced. If W attacks at a, B gets a strong wall around k4 and still has the LL corner left open to step into at b. Thus sacrifying one stone to get profit to both sides. If W saves the corner with c, B has nice followings at d or e.
The UR corner is no longer open and if B attacks the three W stones from the left, W has to play a securing move to keep them alive, giving B the chance to extend towards the UL corner. The result is a good base for B and the upper side is reduced to nearly nothing.
That means: Better play around f now and even more, if done without the previous exchange q18 r17.]
;B[qj]LB[qm:A]C[very defensive. I would've played a to invite a W invasion on the right side. By attacking that invasion B could develop the upper position to back up the attack at the three W stones.]
;W[jj]C[Someone I've talked to a few times who is 2d goes by the proverb that he made up, "Grab tengen as soon as possible." I thought it'd try it ^_^

That's a true proverb, especially in moyo-games like this one. And there are two points to think about:
What is meant by "possible"? 
What use shall I make of tengen?

Possible means not only to be in sente but also that there are no other more important moves left to play. Otherwise you could have played tengen on your first move...

The use of tengen isn't to make territory. Tengen is basically the most influential point on the go-board. So the goal is to make influence. Depending on the situation the point of maximum influence is slightly beside tengen or completely somewhere else. So the meaning of this proverb should be: Take the most influence you can get as soon as possible.

In this case I think it's good to take tengen!
There were two other possibilities: Strengthen your position and take territory or try an invasion. The first one is too defensive, leaving B the control and the chance to take tengen. The second one is too early and risky with no saving point to run to.
With tengenthere is the opportunity to build up enough strength for backing up an invasion.]
;B[cf];W[cj]C[I didn't want to extend from D16, lest he play C8 and threaten C5. Plus, an extension would be overconcentration, wouldn't it?

No overconcentration as long as the three W stone are really far away, but this move is the right consequence of tengen. Put B under pressure, no room for a base and no stone to run to.
Good move.];B[ff]
(;W[fd]LB[cd:A][df:B]C[ok, you're going to take the upper side.

Another move could've been first a, closing the corner and threatening the cut at b. See variation.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ee];W[dg]LB[ed:A]C[No!

This move isn't even threatening a cut. You really should connect at a.]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[ed];W[ec];B[gd];W[df]C[There's still no cut.]
;B[de];W[gc]LB[bc:A]C[Better save the corner first at a.];B[hd]
;W[hc];B[bi];W[ci];B[bc]C[Ouch!
Now B has enough eye-space plus an outside connection. And the pressure onto your top group increases.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[dc];B[cb]C[I know this is a black mistake...after my white mistake. Capturing at B15 would have made my placing there completely pointless -_-

There's no need for B to kill b15 now, he's already captured. C18 is a good move to reduce the eyespace of your top-group, if B manages to cut your stones off.]

(;W[bh]C[As mentioned, c15 is already captured and this attack of little value; and gote.

Maybe you should've better tried to make use of c15 to save your top group in sente.
See variation.];B[ch];W[bf];B[be];W[bg];B[ce];W[id]C[No longer was the H17 group looking secure...so I had to risk leaving the cutting point at D11]
;B[di];W[bj];B[ei];W[gg]C[This had the goal of G16 and F13..unfortunately, I did not see that F13 would not connect my white group at D13...so I guess this was only hoping for a mistake by black.]
;B[gi];W[hh]TR[df][dg][dh]C[The marked stones are lost. So leave that single stone. There is some aji in it, but with this move, it's few left of it.
You still have tengen. Try to build it up, don't make him just another single stone by pushing strong B groups towards him.]
;B[pm];W[mp]C[How should I handle this? He's so developed on that side...I placed N4 blindly in hopes of making sabaki....and splitting his groups

Sounds already a bit desperate to me. Ok, you lost the UL corner, but the game is still open.
It's the right time to invade now, but keep cool. It should be enough to escape into the center or establish a living group at the bottom. If you are also able to close the LL corner by the time, his groups are splitted and not much terrritory is left there.]
;B[oq];W[qo]LB[mn:D][jq:B][mq:A][mr:C]C[That's no sabaki, it's harakiri ; )
You split yourself without getting any strength. Better think about a - d.
With this move you lose any chance of a supporting 3-3 invasion.]
;B[qp];W[pn]C[Another thank you move.];B[on];W[om];B[qm];W[nn]
;B[oo];W[ol];B[oj];W[ni]C[??
That's no help for your haunted group.];B[mk];W[nj];B[nk];W[ok]
C[This puts me into quite the predicament...oddly, though, I thought it a decent move at the time o.O

I suppose building a base now would be best...or running...though that looks very difficult.

You got the point.];B[oi];W[nh];B[li];W[ge]C[This was itching at my brain...I was worried about him seeing it. Leaving my group at the bottom was a mistake though...a big mistake.

You're right again. There's no time for capturing two stones while you're in danger of losing a quarter of the board.]
;B[fo];W[fm];B[dl];W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[fk];W[el];B[ek];W[dm]
;B[fl];W[em]LB[dk:A][fn:B]TR[el]C[I know, you didn't want to lose the cutting point at a, but it's much more important to keep your foot in the door.
Better connect with the bamboo at b and leave the marked stone for a possible ko.
If you lose the group to the right, the whole game is lost. So the chance to connect them to the LL corner has highest priority.]
;B[gm]C[Now the door is shut.];W[ko]C[I am content with leaving the capture of the E9 stones for a later time...since it is gote.]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[mg];W[ng]C[So many weak groups ;_;];B[nf];W[mf]
;B[ne];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[le];W[kg]LB[kh:A]TR[lg][mg]C[a would've been sente on the marked stones.]
;B[lf];W[ki]C[I didn't want to have to end this in gote....but it looked necessary.

I would have rather played something along the lines of L8.

L8 really would've been the better move.];B[kk];W[lk]C[I have a feeling this was a mistake.

Not necessarily. Keeping the B stones apart is no bad move. The other move I suggest is k9.]
;B[ll];W[lj];B[mm]C[From here on it's completely hopeless...but I wanted to try ^_^]
;W[nm]C[the move to keep in play.];B[mo]
(;W[lo]C[empty triangle.
This move neither connects nor cuts it anything. And it doesn't create eyespace. See variation. (There are several more sequences, of course)]

;B[il];W[jk];B[ik];W[nq];B[nr];W[kq]C[A move made with time troubles on the mind. I was also considering M2.

Both give you no eyespace; and I don't see how to get some.]

C[That's it for B. He takes away his own liberties.];W[sp];B[rn]
;W[qs];B[qq]LB[np:A]C[I resigned here after one simple statement. "^_^"

Why that???
What, if W plays at a? The B group is dead.

But besides this, B brought you back into the game. You lost it with your desperately played invasion.
B played a very solid style and you fell into a hazardous gambling, when there still was a chance of taking profit of B's very defensive moves. Go back to your N4 invasion and try  to just reduce territory while running into the open center. Then take the LL corner and after that count the points. You will get an even game with potential in the endgame, especially against a such defensive opponent.
But earlier in the game you should've been more consequent in using and extending the influence of tengen.
You made no catastrophic mistakes, but lost your line and self-confidence against a strong positioned opponent. Maybe you should sometimes look for the same strength in your positional play to avoid such reaction.

I hope this can help you and you enjoyed this review nevertheless.]
