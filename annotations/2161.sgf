C[-Hello,
I'm my name is Thomas Geier. I'm 14k on IGS and 6k on KGS. I'll try my best to review this game for white.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me:
ziggystar@gmx.de];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]C[gobq:  Im never really very creative with my openings.  I play a 4x4 opening but am not sure what other starting positions might be better.

-I usually do the same. I think the opening isn't that important for us amateur level players. So sticking with a standart opening should be fine.]
;B[fq];W[hp]TR[cn]C[gobq:  Here i try the pincer, but usually i am  not very comfortable with the resulting fighting.

-Usually you make a pincer when you have some supporting stones on the right side. 
-I would prefer The usual C6 answer];B[cn]C[gobq:  wow, that was more aggressive than i expected.

-I think the normal answer would be to cut black with E5.]
(;W[dm]TR[dn]C[gobq:  here im trying to make sure my stone on the 4x4 can get out somewhere.

-I don't think this move serves its purpose well.
D6 can separate your white stones.];B[cq];W[fo]C[gobq:  still going for outside influence with my stones.

-White is giving away too much. White had the first stone in this corner. White should try to get at least half of it, which still is possible. See Variation next move.]
;B[dq]
(;W[op]C[gobq:  time for my own approach.  is this too aggresive though?  need i worry about a invasion around m4?

-This is not time to tenuki for white. And I think you wouldn't call it an invasion but a pincer, since the bottom isn't white's yet. White has two stones there. That's not much. Black F3 also radiates influence into that area.]
;B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[nd]C[-The lower corner isn't finished yet. Always remember the proverb 'Urgent moves before big moves'. A play around O6 is definately urgent for white]

(;B[lc];W[pf]TR[oe]C[gobq:  here i try to fence in his stone on the 4x4 to the corner.

-The white stones can be easily separated with P15. Try to avoid this double diagonal play if you want to stay connected.]
;B[oe];W[me]C[gobq:  it looks like he is squezing out, it feels like i should have been able to keep im in the corner more effectively.

-Trying to keep black in a corner if he played there first doesn't seem to be a realistic goal. Only if he plays badly. But this has to show.]
;B[hc]TR[jc]C[-Usually you only make a 3 point extension on the 3rd line because of the weakness of the 4 point extension.

-There's also a proverb that says 4 stones on the third line live.]
;W[fc];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk];B[cj];W[di]C[gobq:  building outside thickness.  im typically not very good at using outside influence though.

-Yes. You have to keep this in mind and find the right time to play a stone in the center to claim some territory. 
Giving black two lines of territory at the side is still acceptable.]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[ch];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[cg]C[gobq:  my stones at d13, e12 look a litte dangerous?

-They have cuting points. Not nescessarily very dangerous right now. But maybe later. You should think about using your thickness by playing a stone in the center before black erases your influence by playing there.]
;W[df];B[dn];W[en];B[hr];W[jq];B[no];W[nn]C[-See why O6 was an urgent move for white?]
;B[mo];W[om];B[pn];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn];W[pj]C[gobq:  this move looked pretty big. trying for an extension from my Q14 and fencing in his stones around Q6

-I think you don't really do this. Your stones on the right are weak and you first need to stabilize them a bit instead of extending creating more cutting points. White's O7 group isn't in immmediate danger. But Q14 needs support. Also I don't think you realize that the two white stones at P4 are lost, if black attacks them with something like O3 and threatens to take a big corner.
With white O2, white can probably either connect out or live. Very big. connecting would also mean separating blacks N6 group from the corner. The N6 group will later become blacks entrance to white's huge center. See variations.

During the game both player continually keep missing to play in this big area.]

(;B[qk]
(;W[qj]C[gobq:  the iron pillar is strong?

-This answer is ok.];B[rj];W[ri];B[sj];W[si];B[rl]C[gobq:  shouldnt these sequences all the way to the edge be left for the end game?  was there more profit for me elsewhere?

-White had to safe it's group, so answering was appropriate. Since it black kept answering, the sequence turned out to be good for white, now having some more support for Q14.]
;W[he]TR[gd]C[gobq:  to utilize my outside influence, im trying to cap in his stones on the edge.

-I think white's group on the right side still needs some care. And again the double diagonal play leaving a weakness at G16 where black can cut and break through.]
;B[ke];W[mg];B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[hg];B[gg];W[gf];B[ff];W[hf]
;B[fe]C[gobq:  i think i tend to attack stones too closely.  if i attack from furhter away, can i containg black more effectively?

-Usually you try to attack from a distance because playing contact plays helps the attacked stones. Sometimes you have to do it, like here (where it succeeded).]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[ee];B[nc]C[-See variation for a nice attack on blacks G16 group.]

(;W[od];B[oc]C[-Very many small plays by both players, completely ignoring the big lower right.]
;W[pe];B[md];W[ne];B[id];W[kg];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[rd]
C[-This is a small endgame sequence (gote for black, btw). Ignoring the lower right (which can turn the game completely for both sides), C14 and G18 would be bigger and sente.]
;W[nq]C[-Finally someone plays here.];B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq]
;B[lr];W[kq];B[pq];W[lo];B[oq];W[mr];B[np];W[kr];B[nr];W[ls]
C[gobq:  did i get lucky here?  i think white could have captured my stones around N3?

-Not a good result for white, since the P4 stones, which separated black's center from the corner are now lost.]
;B[km]C[-Now the doors are wide open for black. Let's see what white can save.]
;W[jm];B[kk];W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[fh];W[gh];B[eg];W[fi];B[jj]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[ii]C[gobq:  trying to use my thickness to its advantage...]
;B[li];W[nj];B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[mi]TR[mh]C[gobq:  separting black seems like a good idea...

-Not possible here. Black can simply plays N12 to connect.]
;B[mj];W[mh];B[lh];W[lg];B[ok];W[lj];B[mk];W[ki];B[kj];W[kh]
;B[nk]C[gobq:  now it feels  like not conecting stones around O8 was a big mistake...]

(;W[oj];B[kn]C[gobq:  at this point if I had not allowed the bamboo joint at L6, could i have killed the large black group from K11 to L7?

-This connection was solid, even without L6. L6 just sneaks into white's territory. (variation)]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[cf]C[gobq:  this seemed pretty big.  was it?

-Indeed];B[cc];W[dc]C[gobq:  i get a little panicy when i get invaded on the 3x3.  could i have stopped this  better?

-I think the invasion should be successful at either connecting out or living.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[ae];W[cb];B[af];W[bg];B[bh]
(;W[bc]C[gobq:  looking back, would white at A13 have been better?

-definately (see variation)];B[ag]C[gobq:  now black is connected :(]
;W[bd]C[-With the next move, endgame begins.];B[ad];W[gq];B[jn]
;W[in];B[gr];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[cp];W[jh];B[le];W[lf]TR[mf]
C[gobq:  looking back, this move (M14) doesnt look very good for white?

-Indeed it doesn't serve any purpose. A black stone at N14 would be no threat.]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jo];W[ir];B[jp]C[gobq:  here again, i think i made a mistake not connecting?

-No need to worry. The white stones can live on their own.]

(;W[ga];B[ha];W[fa];B[ib];W[ln]C[-Black answered this move in a wrong way and ended up losing around 30 points and because of it the game.
See variation for correct black answer.]
(;B[lm];W[ol]C[gobq:  here im feeling pretty proud for setting this up.  even if he connects he is in atari.]
;B[pp];W[ml];B[sf];W[sg];B[qi]C[-Capturing T14 is an option here.]

(;W[qh];B[se];W[rh]TR[rg]C[gobq:  i agonized over this connection for a while.  i think i chose correctly, but for some reason it looked strange to me.

-White had to protect against the double atari at S13];B[jf]
;W[ig];B[ie];W[pm]C[gobq:  i drive a spike into blacks teratory to reduce it...]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[rn];W[do];B[co];W[ac];B[ah];W[qo]
;B[ro];W[pc]C[gobq:  for some reason this looked tempting, but it didnt work...

-White is even catchable in a ladder.]
(;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[nb];W[jg];B[kf];W[if];B[hd];W[tt]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[-White decided to play a influence based center game early when abandoning the lower left corner. 
White often missed to play urgent moves to save groups (but quite as often did black miss to punish him).
Both player played small moves instead of big or urgent moves.
Especially the lower right corner had been ignored constantly although it hold the potential for white to get a huge center territory by cutting off and eventually capturing black's N6 group and for black to get a big corner and a base for an invasion of white's center.
After black ensuring this connection black was ahead in points but failed to handle white M6 and losing 30 points, ending up with a close defeat.]
