;B[pd]C[Hello, and thanks for taking time to review my game. I was playing white in this game, and I lost without really understanding where I went wrong.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[qo]SQ[cf][df]C[Though R5 is not unplayable, I'd prefer to stabilize the upper left corner.

The point is to finish the lower right joseki with sente, then ...]
;B[ql]
(;W[qq]TR[fc][pd][ql]C[Because of the black formation initiating a moyo, I'd choose a more centric joseki (see variation), but there is no harm yet in this joseki.]

(;W[qn]C['always' hit on the head of 3 stones ...
This allows you to either put the pressure on those stones, or get into the centre ...]
;B[om]
(;W[jq]TR[fq]C[is this one space too near?

No, this seems correct to me, but personnally, I would play F3, which is enough to reduce the moyo very solidly]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs];B[gq]C[good play by black]
(;W[jo]C[is n3 better here?

Yes, because it stabilizes more efficiently your shape, and nullifies the influence of the black wall.

Your group wont be safe right away, but I prefer the variation]
;B[go];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[lq]C[This is the wrong direction from black.
You should try to refutate this]
(;W[jm]LB[hp:A][lo:C][lr:B]C[this is annoying : you should try to expand your shape and defend it :

The most common techniques are

A) kikashi (always play first when defending)
B) attach to stabilise (see variation)
C) shape move];B[ip];W[jp];B[hm]C[now black has a stronger shape and you have a liability]
;W[kl]TR[io][lp][mn]C[same comment. (too slow)];B[mc];W[cg]
C[ok];B[dl]TR[go][hm]C[what is white's best response now?

This stone is not well connected, and if you try to cut it from the marked stones, you will oblige black to stabilise on the side, while strengthening yourself inbetween.

This might be helpful for your lone stick
(see variations which just show the spirit, not to be taken for granted )]

;W[ik]C[should white have moved somewhere else here?

the problem with this move is it's uneffective.

- no territorry
- no specific influence
- no attacking potential
- only 1/2 eye.

The proper moves have been show previoulsy];B[ci];W[ec]C[is d17 better?

yes, because after BF16, there is still aji at C17.

Besides, the exchange of WE17 against B F17 is too good for B]
;B[fd];W[eg]C[is this too slow?

I think the next black move answers this];B[jd];W[hl];B[gl]
;W[im];B[cm];W[cn];B[ck]C[Black helped you significantly here by playing extremely slow moves.]
;W[gm];B[gn]
(;W[gk]C[No !

H6 is the only move !
You miss the opportunity to make a ponnuki, making you almost unconditionnally alive, and threatening to cut the black shape.]

(;B[fl]C[black helps you there too !];W[qd]C[what is the correct way to invade here?

This is correct.
S16 is also playable];B[qe]C[correct]
(;W[pe]C[see variations for usual plays];B[qf]
(;W[pf]TR[gk][hl][ik][im][jm][kl]C[No, this is a mistake in direction : because of you centre group, you should take the corner]
;B[pc];W[qg];B[rd];W[rf];B[re];W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[rh];W[qj]
;B[pj];W[ri]C[p10 first is better right?

yes];B[qk];W[rj];B[rg]C[Hmm, P10 again];W[qh];B[oj];W[qc];B[rc]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[ne];B[nd];W[nh]C[is n15 here better?

I prefer O12, because B will play it if you play N15];B[mj]
C[at this point it seems like white is too far behind in territiry already. is that right?

not too far behind.

You have sente.
With a play at E18, you can start to catch up.

Besides, B should not make any territorry on the bottom, if white play there first (as I showed in the beginnig).

The game will be hard, but still a game]
(;W[og]C[Of course, you make 2 eyes, but playing within your shape means you lost 10 points.

You should flatten B on top while expanding your group.];B[fk]
;W[gj];B[kr]C[this hurts];W[mo]C[good];B[np]C[would h18 work here?

Yes, likely];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc];W[bh];B[bi];W[hn];B[en]
;W[jr]TR[hf][ld][pm]C[your last moves were excellent, and you made big yose moves.

However, there are bigger points now];B[me]C[This hurts];W[nf]
;B[ff];W[mp];B[mq];W[pn];B[on];W[ld]TR[ai][bn][nk][no][sh]C[at this point i was desparate, since i figured i was going to lose if i played normally.

end of questions.

You are 15 point behind, but you have sente.


You have several ko threats or reduction plays, but that might not be enough.]

;W[np];B[lp];W[lo];B[jj]C[ltan has resigned the game.




The main reason you lost the game was because you played not efficiently enough with your centre shape, which remained a liability, instead of being used for attacking / reducing black.

Also, since you did not take the upper right corner, Black ended up with a consistent upper side.

Remember to make territory 'opposite' to your strength.

Last, you moved a couple of stones too slowly (centre group, P13) and let B take the initiative.


Hope this helped.
