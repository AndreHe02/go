C[Andre: Hi, this is a real-life game I played at a tournament.
Due to
time constraints I did not record it to the end. I'm currently
in a slump
and lose most of the time, so I'm looking for a way out :-).

Magnus: Hi, initially I just looked through the game quickly
and seems to me that you have at least one bad habit you could
work on: You often play forcing moves that make the weak groups
of the opponent stronger.];B[pd];W[ec];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[dr];W[hq];B[cq];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[gp];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr]
;B[hp]C[This push is very bad I think. You should just play G5.  1) Then you can severly with K3 and the peep at j2 is good aji
even if white defends the group.

2) The you can aim at a peep at E5 later followed by cutting
through white with D5 etc.];W[iq]C[Now white has an eye And your stones are heavy with only three
liberties.];B[cp]C[Another forcing move. White get stronger from this move.
B5 is better. It makes your corner alive and threatens to cut
white.];W[do];B[gm]C[Andre: Is this good direction? I felt I had to do something for
the four stones...

MP: I would play M3 first, forcing white to play perhaps j4 and
then jump into the center.];W[bo];B[dq]C[D3 is not a move you need for your eyeshape, at least not right
now.];W[ep]C[Now You have lost the atari at f5 that could make the difference
later in center fighting.];B[co];W[dm];B[en]C[This is a good forcing move. The opponent is forced to play a
move he does not gain from.];W[dn];B[bp];W[bn];B[br]C[Andre:
Maybe this is not really necessary...

MP:
I think it is but is to complex to read out.];W[io]C[Bad move. It leaves a severe cut.]
;B[hn];W[nq];B[ip]C[Andre: I
felt this is more important, or is it to safe?

MP: it is ok to play here but the followup should be different.]
;W[jp]C[Cut where it hurts. See the variations.]
(;B[jo];W[kp];B[jn]C[Black got safety but the price was high. White now has perfect
shape and territory on the lower side, and that is because black
has forced those good moves despite several mistakes by white.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[oq];B[op];W[pq];B[qq];W[mp];B[qo];W[pn];B[nn]
;W[qj];B[qr]C[Andre: Again I play 'safety
first'...

Yes but since this group is out in the center you want to attack
the white group on the right side first. If white then defends
that would be good opportunity to play in the corner. If white
plays in the corner then you simply invade white or attack from
the outside in order to develop the upper side.];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[rd]C[Now black has no territory at all];B[dk]C[Andre: Now I thought it's time to
attack. By the way, White's formation on the right looks not
too solid, I
suppose an invasion at R12 is possible, but is it a good idea?
In the end,
White had all the territory on the right, which may have been
a reason for
his victory.

MP:
Yes, all the mistakes so far has summed up and became the territory
on the right side. Attacking severly is probably the best strategy,
but you have to be consequent.];W[el];B[fj]C[This move does not stop white and it can be cut. Black should
perhaps make a short extension to D12 perhaps. Then white would
be eyeless in the center.];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk]C[Perhaps D11 would be strong even if it is often accused of being
bad shape. Your extension will end up ineffective if white cuts.]
;B[cf]C[Andre: I anticipated
the moves that follow, but maybe a more intelligent plan to keep
pressure
on White is possible.];W[ek];B[ej];W[dj];B[di];W[cj];B[ci];W[ck]
TR[cf]C[The bad stones end up in a bad low position.
In this case it was not hard to predict since the cut was imminent
and you should have decide on how to treat the cut before you
played C14, and then you could have realized that C14 was a bad
move and played something else.];B[cc];W[jd]TR[cf][cc]C[This white move is very bad.  The marked black stones are a loss
because they are too strong in a small area - that is overconcentrated.
Now white played a thin move that allows black to use the strength.
White should have played h17.];B[hd]C[Andre: I
was rather surprised by White's move, but is my answer any good?

MP:
It look good to me.];W[cb];B[bb];W[ce];B[dd]C[Andre: Again, a rather weird move by White, no?

MP: Playing moves like this in a desperate situation is normal.
It now becomes complicated which was the hope of white I guess.]
;W[db];B[ed]C[BEEP! This is completly the same mistake as H4 earlier on.

The only move here are D15 (capturing a stone once and for all
or even stronger G6 that would make it really hard for those
white stones to get away.];W[fd]TR[hd]C[Now the marked stone get in trouble, and the cut does not work
as well this time.];B[fc]C[Andre: Maybe not so great, is F15 better?]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[gc];B[fb];W[gb];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[he]C[Playing Black J15 and then J16 look crazy but I thin that is
the way to fight here.];B[lc];W[ie];B[jb];W[ib];B[jc];W[ic]
;B[rc];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[od];W[oj];B[rn]C[Andre: Now White looks good on the right, so I decided to
start the endgame :-).];W[rm];B[ro];W[ql];B[sd];W[re];B[nf]
;W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[ns];W[mr];B[bi]C[Andre: I totally underestimated how much the following moves
reduce my territory, so maybe this is a big mistake?

MP: No this is a good move. Perhaps a small mistake but not a
big mistake.];W[gg];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dh];W[gh];B[ei]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[gf];B[ee]C[Andre: Now I think White's position is good, because he has
also more center influence than before.

Yes, but E15 is bad it is worth less than 4 points in reverse
sente. B9 would be better I think.];W[le];B[lg];W[mf];B[mg]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[of];B[mj]C[Andre: In the game I
though that capturing White with L15 was not possible but now
it seems to
me it is. Anyway, the center was rather neutral in the end. I
made a
five-point blunder in the late endgame, so 8.5 points for White
gives a
more realistic result. Thank you in advance for your comments!

MP: L15 does not work as far as I can see.

Ok. I found some things in the game you can look at.

One important thing is that when you play a forcing move your
stone has to be worth *more* than the move the opponent answer
with.

A common bad habit is to think that every sente move is good
but it is not. -5 points in sente is worse then passing!

The best value of sente is not that you can keep it, but because
it allows you to play a big move. Perhaps the vital point in
the fight. If you plays forcing moves all the time the opponent
will likely simply become stronger and your eliminating your
potential to play other moves later.])
