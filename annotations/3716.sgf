C[Kamtre [24k\]: hey, good game

Hey reveiwer.. I don't really have much to ask except for corrections on my errors, and how to push thru defenses more effectively/safely.
Thanks!

;W[pg];B[od]LB[pg:A]TR[pd][qd]C[[Broege: A good move by Black, known as 'one thousand dollar turn'. It projects influence to the top side of the board. Moreover White A stone is too close to the triangled stones.\]]

;W[kq];B[ko]LB[dq:A][dr:B]C[[Broege: This move does not attack White stones hard - they are quite strong after the last move. Perhaps playing at A or even B would be better - White group would be partially cut off from the edge and in need to find to protect its eyespace below or to run into the center.

Moreover a move like A would strengten Black control of the corner.\]]
;W[ld]C[[Broege: This is rather too close to strong Black stones. There is a saying that one should not play too close to thick (strong) stones - neither opponent's nor own ones.\]]

;B[gk]LB[ci:B][dj:A][dq:C]C[[Broege: I don't understand the idea behind this move. It is not connected to anything, does attack any White stones nor does it strengten Black groups nor maps territory. How about A or B for enhancing own influence or C for attacking White?\]]
;W[dg];B[gg]LB[ng:A][nj:B]C[[Broege: This move is similar to the previous one - it's hard to see its purpose. Certainly it does not make any territory - even if Black played A and B the centre would not become his territory.\]]

On the other hand Black is so much behind that some more drastic measures should be taken - i.e. invading at B or trying to get most from the bottom by attacking at C or D.

[Broege: Joseki is a sequence of moves (usually in a corner, sometimes at the edge) that gives roughly equal result for both players. It may also be though of as a sequence of correct moves.\]]

[Broege: I have two final remarks that could help you play better:
1. Play more bravely in the opening - extend further from you stones, try to attack more. In my opinion it's much better to overdo it than not to try. If your attacks don't work - you will see why as your opponent will defend. If they do work - you gain territory and/or influence.
2. Try to solve some basic problems - like capturing stones or killing a corner. This will allow you to avoid weak shapes that can be exploited by your opponent.\]]
