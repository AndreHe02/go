----------------------------------------------
Hi,

I am Jens-Uwe and currently around 14k on KGS (user 'jug'), so please take my comments in this review not as the absolute truth, but I will try and give what insights I can at my level.

All my comments begin with 'JUG'. When introducing go-concepts i mostly use japanese terms, but i've added a short description on first use; a more detailed explanation you may find on Sensei's Library http://senseis.xmp.net/, which is also a great free resource about all topics of Go.
I've used CGoban v2.6.12 to edit this SGF.

JUG: In the game W (white) wanted to go for center-territory and B (black) aimed to get the corners. Then the game quickly evolved in a heavy fighting game.
Requested was a review for the W side, but i also added some comments about the B moves. You can learn from those comments as well.

Please follow the main-path and the referred variations there, because some basics are explained in those variations, that are needed for understanding some follow-up-comments in the review. I refer to them as "see var before (this move)" or "see next var". There are many variations, and not all are referred. If there is more than one branch, it's good to check out all vars.

At the beginning i've included many basic things, so it's quiet some text material to comprehend.
At the first dozen moves i make statements about "proper" play, later i concentrate more on the moves actually made.

For the main game i almost always commented on the played moves, chances W and also B missed, what to look out for and how to handle certain situations.
At the end of the game i finish with a summary and on what to concentrate to improve.

Sometimes the comments may sound a bit harsh or reproachful. If that's the case, i apologize for that in advance.
We all have gone through this learning process. Try to be open-minded and embrace new ideas how to play Go.

Enjoy the review.

Cheers,

JUG: B goes for the corner, which is a normal first move.

By the way, some go-etiquette: the first play of B is normally played in the upper-right corner at one of the marked places ABCDE. That's part of showing gratitude and respect to play a game. This has its history in ancient times. The W player normally is stronger and playing here implied a "bow".

Some basic terms first: a game is divided into three stages:
- 1. fuseki (the opening), where each players claims a portion of territory and moyo (frameworks) to develop further
- 2. chuban (middle-game), here normally the fighting about territory starts
- 3. yose (endgame), where the borders of the territories are closed up

Back to the game:
There are so-called "proverbs", which contains some go-wisdom in short sentences.

One is: "corners first, then side, then center".
It refers to the fact, that territory is easiest made in the corner, then go for side-territory and after that, go towards the center. To illustrate this, see first next var (variation).

For beginners a play at 'A' or 'B' is recommended. The other moves (C, D, E) are special moves not to be bothered with at first:
- a stone at 'A' on a hoshi (star-point) has a bigger desire to grow and show influence towards the outside, but it can be invaded at the 3-3 point (P15) at any time. To close such a corner, B needs normally 2 more moves.
- a stone at 'B' is a more solid claim to get the corner and influences also the side. Can be closed with only one move more, e.g. at 'E'.

IMPORTANT:
I now describe a way how to find your next move.
At every move you ask yourself 3 questions to get the aim for your next move:
- 1. are my groups ok ? how many weak groups do i have (count them) ? -> should be no more than one. If you have weak groups -> help them to get healthy
If you have no weak groups -> 2nd question
- 2. are opponents groups ok ? how many weak groups does he have (count) ? -> if he has one -> attack
If opponent has no weak groups -> 3rd question
- 3. are there big areas open for a play (count them) ? normally there are always at least 4-6 areas to consider -> play in the biggest area if no own weak groups to defend or weak opponents groups to attack

Those three questions i refer as "THE-LIST". I sometimes include examples during the review for it.

Here for example:
1. am i ok ? -> yes (no move played ;), 2. is B ok ? -> yes, 3. where are big areas ? => area 1,2,3
so play a big point, but where ? ask yourself, what is the biggest area ? -> it's area 3, so play there. Then look for a move in that area, for example at '3' or at 'F' or 'G' or even at 'H'.

Go is a game of balance and the goal is to get more territory than the other, but you can't get ALL the territory. The other get's something too. Don't envy your opponents territory too much. Better to build some territory too, than the game will be fair.
Funny thing is, that when you try to get too much, you could be punished for your greed and mostly end up with less territory. Mostly the one who breaks the balance first, is going to loose.

For two examples of a normal game checkout the next 2nd var.]

(;W[id]LB[nn:A]C[JUG: This is not a natural move: 'A' is the biggest area to aim for. As seen some moves later, W may wanted to get the center, but that is very difficult to do (mostly impossible at such early stage of the game).]
;B[nd]LB[dd:C][dn:B][nn:A]C[JUG: B took another big point, though not the biggest area at 'A', and B splits himself on a large scale.
A good point for B would also be at 'B', because that works better together with his 'C'-stone.]
;W[ei]LB[ci:C][dn:B][nn:A]C[JUG: this is not the biggest area, that is at 'A' or 'B'
also this move is making zero points and is too high, B can play under it at 'C' (see next var for example)]

(;B[nn]C[alski: im new

JUG: another big corner];W[ni]LB[dn:A]C[JUG: 'A' is biggest area now]
;B[nh]LB[of:E][mh:B][mi:D][oi:C][dn:A]C[JUG: this is a bit early and could be regarded as overplay (a move that want to gain too much). It's simply not needed, B can simply play at 'A', or if he wants to help this corner out, play at 'E'.
On a 9x9 board this move could be acceptable, but on the big boards one must follow different strategies and tactics.

W could also answer this ...
- at 'B' (hane), see 1st var (end up not so good for W)
- at 'C' (extend down), see 2nd var (should be best i think)
- at 'D' (extend up), see 3rd var]
(;W[in]LB[dn:A]C[JUG: biggest area is 'A'];B[dn]LB[oo:A]C[noggles: me too

JUG: B played all corner-stones at the hoshi (4-4 stone: D14, O14, O4, D4).
Those stones can be invaded at the 3-3 point, e.g. at 'A' (P3) -> check var for that]

(;W[on]LB[ol:A]C[JUG: this is also possible to reduce (attach to stone), but more difficult, at 'A' is more simpler]
;B[oo]C[JUG: a B "hane" (bend around) is a possible answer]

(;W[mn]LB[nn:A]C[JUG: this is a bad move.

A basic concept in go is to stay connected, because connected stones or groups are strong and cannot be easily attacked.

Here W played at the other side and split himself, therefore it's a bad move.
The 'A' stone sit where W would like to connect.

The variations on previous move show better ways to handle this situation.]
;B[om]LB[nm:A][no:B]C[JUG: playing at 'A' or 'B' as Black is better (be strong, less cutting points, and W's stones looking weaker)]
;W[pn]LB[nm:A][no:B]C[JUG: this was good, don't make it too easy to catch you.
Without this move B needed only one move to capture the W stone.
But now, B needs THREE moves to capture the 2 W stones, this can be used to your advantage.
B has 2 cuts now at 'A' and 'B'.];B[po];W[pm]LB[po:A]C[JUG: this was good too, W escapes now]

(;B[qn]LB[ol:A]C[JUG: a mistake, B's only chance to capture W is playing at 'A' (see var before)]

(;W[pl]LB[nm:A]C[JUG: good, but even better would have been the double-atari at 'A']
;B[ol];W[no];B[nm]LB[mo:B][no:A]C[JUG: whenever you make a move like this, there remains a cutting point at 'B' to be aware of, which eventually it's better to defend soon]

(;W[qk]LB[ok:A][pk:B]C[JUG: this has to be on 'A' or 'B' (see var before)]

(;B[mo];W[np];B[lo];W[ok]C[JUG: good];B[mm];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm]

(;B[ll]LB[mk:B][ml:D][nm:A][np:C]C[JUG: this ladder does not work for B, but B is forced to do that, or else his 'A'-stones are to be captured. He may try a move at 'B' or 'D' instead (see var before), but W may put heavy pressure on it.

The only chance B got here to save 'A' is to increase his liberties then capture Ws 'C'-stones]

(;W[ko]LB[km:A][mm:B][mo:C]TR[lm][ln][mn]C[JUG: a mistake, the ladder favours W, so at 'A' now is the ONLY move here for W (see var before).
That's because those marked 3 stones are cutting stones and therefore very important. They cut 2 B groups apart: 'B' and 'C', making them weak.]
;B[km]C[JUG: too easy for B, thanks to this move capturing the cutting stones, B is now connected, alive and W is weak all around that B group]

(;W[dm]LB[km:D][fo:C][mp:E][op:B][pp:A]TR[in][ko]C[JUG: playing at 'A' or 'B' would be quiet big (see vars) and takes the corner.
Leaving a place where you are weak to open up a new fight, is generally not good.
Besides of that, directly attaching a stone is generally not good either (only in special circumstances).

An approach move at 'C' may prove better, it also works better together with your marked stones (see var before).

Worth a note is also the B 'D'-group here:
As it is now it's a strong group, which can easily live by escaping to the center or capture the corner (move at 'E').]
;B[cm];W[bm]LB[dl:B][em:A][cn:C]C[JUG: don't split yourself, better extend first at 'A' or 'B' or crosscut at 'C']
;B[cl];W[cn]LB[em:A]C[JUG: this doesn't work, better at 'A']
;B[co];W[bn];B[bo]
(;W[eo]LB[do:A]C[JUG: this move is called a peep, because it threatens to cut at 'A'. It's used to get a free move to be used to aid some other stones normally.

Instead of a peep you should almost consider a direct cut too (here that would be 'A').

BUT if you have no follow-up-attack after a peep or cut, then better don't peep or cut, because it will only help the opponent becoming stronger, making such a move a so-called "thank-you-move".]
;B[de]LB[db:D][dc:F][ch:E][cn:C][do:A][eo:B]C[JUG: correct for B would be 'A' now, which keep the W stones split, and so making 'B'-stone weak and captured the 'C'-group
Though this move at D13 is big (it aims for securing corner territory), but can still be invaded with 'D' for example or reduced from the bottom side around 'E'-area. A better move to secure territory in the NW (north-west) corner would be at 'F' instead.]
;W[em]
(;B[bl]LB[do:A]C[JUG: a mistake by B, 'A' maybe better (keeping W split), but it's still difficult to tell (see var before)]
;W[do]C[JUG: very good]
(;B[en]LB[fn:A]C[JUG: a mind-slip of B ;)
here a peep at 'A' may come to mind, but ... (see var before)]
;W[fn];B[an];W[am]C[JUG: good, keep split];B[ao]
(;W[dp]C[JUG: Good. After this move the corner is dead for sure. There's nothing B can do.
W could even tenuki (play somewhere else) here. Then the only way for B to live in the corner is with a ko.
So this move may be ok to avoid B living with a ko and keep things simple.]
;B[cp];W[dq]LB[ap:B][bq:A]C[JUG: this isn't needed, B can't make 2 eyes (need 2 moves in a row for that at 'A' and 'B'), so B is dead as it stands ("unconditionally dead")]
;B[cq]
(;W[bq]C[JUG: this isn't needed, B still dead (see var before).
That's because B needs 2 moves in a row to live.

To get better in tsumego (life & death) you have to know the killing and living shapes.
I've included the most common one in the next var.]
(;B[bp]C[JUG: misread by B (self-atari).
There's a proverb for this situation: "In the corner strange things are happening." ;-)]

(;W[ap]LB[aq:A]C[JUG: good!
Playing at 'A' would have also killed the group, but is inferior (see var before)]
;B[df]LB[ib:2][dd:H][nd:I][of:4][bh:3][ph:J][ci:A][ii:1][cl:B]
[pl:D][km:G][cn:C][po:F][np:E]C[JUG: this is a bad move (too small), if here, B should better take 'A' (this helps his 'B'-stones and closes the corner more

So let's apply "THE-LIST" to find the next move for W: first ask 3 questions:
- 1. am I ok ? -> 'C' is ok, 'D' is ok, 'E' not ok (but we discussed that earlier and so skipping it, though saving 'E' and regetting the corner is still big)
- 2. is other ok ? -> 'B' not ok, 'F' not ok (can be captured, already discussed, so skipped here), 'H' is ok, 'I' is ok => so 'B' would make a good target
- 3. big areas ? -> areas numbered: '1' looks big, but is a bit vague (B can enter from at least 3 directions), '3' is big (especially if B gets another move here, e.g. at 'A'), '2' next biggest, '4' not so big (because skirt open around 'J') => must prevent that B gets area '3'

so area '3' and attacking 'B'-group is the target:
now we search a move for that purpose.

Another proverb often helps in such situations: "Play where the other wants to play"
=> so 'A' would be the move (see next var), because that move is also to Bs likings.]

(;W[ck]C[JUG: You had the right idea, but according to another proverb this is "too close to thickness", meaning that a single stone has not much power to harm a "thick" group of stones. In such cases, you must attack from a distance (see var before).]

(;B[eg]LB[oh:A]C[JUG: B choose to ignore, which is not so good, though maybe he saw no way to help his attacked 3 stones (but see var before).
And this move he made, is a small move ->at 'A' would be much bigger]
;W[bk]LB[id:B][ch:A]C[JUG: good, W now also can slide in at 'A', though helping the 'B'-stone is now more urgent]
;B[eh]C[JUG: another small move]
(;W[ak]LB[bh:D][di:E][ei:C][fi:F][dk:A][ek:B]TR[dd][de][df]
[eg][eh][fh][gh][hh][ih][jh][kh][lh]C[JUG: this is not needed, B can't escape any more, if here a move at one of 'ABDEF' would have been better, also helping your 'C'-stone.
B is building a strong wall, and may aim for a big moyo (marked), so there's no time to defend here (also see var before)]
;B[di];W[dl]LB[lc:B][bh:D][ei:A][ej:C]C[JUG: not needed, the urgent area is now at 'B', so better get some big points there.
Doing something for Ws 'A' stone, for example at 'C', or even ignore it and slide under at 'D' is inferior.]
;B[ci]LB[bi:A]C[JUG: this is a big side (B is happy), W can still slide in later at 'A' (but that should be reserved for yose (endgame)).]

(;W[al]C[JUG: those 3 B stones are already dead, no need to capture.
This move is worse than passing, because W played in his own territory, so -1p.

In fact W gave up sente (the initiative) here. That's another VERY IMPORTANT concept in go.
One should keep sente (the initiative) as long as possible to play the big points without forgetting to keep healthy groups. So sometimes you have to give up your sente to protect a weak group.
To know when you can play away and don't need to capture is a learning process, which makes go so interesting.

With this move you take gote (a move that need not to be answered) and give up sente back to B.]
;B[bj]C[JUG: also very small, this gives W sente back and the chance to get a big point]
;W[bi]C[JUG: this is a good move, but should be reserved for the endgame and that's not started as long as there are big areas open to play]
;B[bh];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[cj];W[dj]LB[ej:A]C[JUG: this is not good, because B can put you on double-atari with 'A' (see next 1st var).

If here then better at 'A', but bigger points are more urgent now.
B could also ignore this (see next 2nd var).

From here on i don't mention the "big points" any more and concentrate only on local moves.]

(;B[dh];W[ag]LB[bg:A]C[JUG: this doesn't work, B could simply capture the stone with 'A'. If W runs, B follows (see next var)]

(;B[af];W[bg];B[ch];W[ae]
(;B[bf];W[cg];B[cf];W[fh]LB[fi:B][ej:A]C[JUG: This leaves back cutting points 'A' and 'B', which B can exploit at 'A' for example (double-atari)]

(;B[ld]LB[lc:B][id:A]C[JUG: B took big point (though at 'B' would have been more severe, attacking the base of Ws 'A'-stone).
Now it's very difficult for W to do something here.]
(;W[fg]LB[ef:1][dg:2]C[JUG: this move is ok locally.
B has 2 liberties, so B was a bit fearful to capture at '2' now]
;B[dg]LB[fj:A]C[JUG: a W move at 'A' fixes Ws cutting points]
;W[ng]LB[oc:C][id:B][pd:D][nh:A]C[JUG: 'A'-stone splits Ws shape, so not good, must help 'B' first, or invade the corner at 'C' or 'D' while it's still open]

(;B[nf]C[JUG: same mistake by B this time (maybe he imitates you ;)]
;W[oh]C[JUG: excellent];B[mh];W[mg]C[JUG: good move, keep B groups split]
;B[lf]LB[of:A][og:B]C[JUG: this is strange, B should better peep at 'A' to threat a cut at 'B']

(;W[li]LB[lh:A]C[JUG: if here, then better atari at 'A'];B[lh]
;W[kh]LB[lg:A]C[JUG: have to be on 'A', keeping B split

NOTE: from here on, i comment not on every move (because still 200 moves to review)]
;B[lg];W[me]LB[oc:B][og:D][ki:A][mi:C]C[JUG: this move is a bit doubtful, though may be a good preparation to invade the corner 'B'.
Though B could make the situation more complex with an atari at 'D' (see next var).]

(;B[mf];W[og];B[kg]LB[id:B][kf:A][of:C]C[JUG: this is bad shape for B (the three stones around 'A' form an "empty triangle").
A move at 'C' now is big or attacking 'B'.]
(;W[nc]LB[oc:A][pd:B]C[JUG: good idea, but easier at 'B'. Living with a ko at 'A' is possible too, but not now, because W has no ko-threats to use (see vars before).]
;B[jh]LB[nc:A]C[JUG: it's not good to ignore 'A', W could give up one stone and live in the corner now (see next var)]

(;W[ki]C[JUG: this is ok too];B[md];W[ih];B[jg]
(;W[le]LB[ke:A]C[JUG: if here, then better peep at 'A' (see var before)]
;B[ke];W[oe]C[JUG: good];B[ne]
(;W[je]LB[oe:A]C[JUG: only peeping without a follow-up move or attack is not good, so go on with your plan at 'A' (see var before)]
;B[jd];W[jc]C[JUG: this atari is a good idea];B[kd]
(;W[qp]LB[ic:A][jc:D][ie:B][pp:C]C[JUG: same here, if you play an atari like this (at 'D'), you are leaving back two cutting points at 'A' and 'B'. So it's better now to go on playing there (see var before).

In general, if you have a plan, don't abandon it, but stick to it.
A plan could be "try to make life for a group", "attack another group", "connect some groups", "split some groups", "start a fight to make things complex" (e.g. in handicap-games).
A plan can have global implications (over the whole board), but often has a more local character.

You can combine searching for a move by applying "THE-LIST" with making local plans.
Use THE-LIST to search the important area to play, then make a plan (e.g. "attack a weak group"). Then search for moves to fulfill your plan (and stick to it). Abandon only, if you encounter a situation, where you are going to loose more than winning.

Beside of that, this move at R2 is a good idea to rescue the corner, but 'C' would be the move (this was already discussed at the beginning).]
;B[op];W[qm];B[mp];W[qo]C[JUG: good, get something at least]

(;B[nq]LB[pp:A]C[JUG: this wasn't needed, the 2 W stones had only one lib (liberty left), so it was dead, though it removes a W sente-move at 'A' (see var before).]

;B[jb]LB[hg:A]C[JUG: it's funny to watch this game.
The B player showed a better understanding of strategy (big points and so), but has more difficulties with reading.

Reading is the ability to think of moves ahead in your mind before you play them.
Professional players are able to think ahead 20 moves, and even more if it's involving a forced sequence.
Improving in reading is the key to get better as beginner and also for stronger players.]
;W[ib]LB[bc:A][pc:D][gd:H][de:K][le:B][pi:E][hl:G][co:F][no:C]
TR[gi][hi][jj][jk][jl][im][io][ip][iq]SQ[da][db][dc][jo][jp]
[jq]C[JUG: now half of the game has passed.

Let's now take a break and count territories.
In a game it's good to count from time to time, if you lead in territory or if falling behind.

Knowing this then, you can adjust your playing style:
- if leading, play simple moves
- if behind or leading with a close gap, you must be or may be more offensive to catch up or stay ahead (depends)

To count, you descend from key-stones down to the borders or directly compare territories.
- 1. identify possible areas and imagine reasonable borders (simply descending gives a good estimate)
- 2. determine who owns the areas, determine undecided areas
- 3. count or estimate the territory in the areas, sum them up, and compare them for both players, also add the captured stones and the komi
note: a stone in ones territory counts twice (the stone itself and the point it covers)

Example:
- ad 1) identified areas A-H
- ad 2) B areas are A, B, C;  W areas are D (also K16 + Q13), E, F (all spaces left from 'G'-area);
'H' is undecided, each side has stones there and can claim it, so it's reasonable to count half-area for each player
'G'-area is mostly Ws, though still a little open to Bs reduction
- ad 3) A=19p, B=2p, C=10p, D=12p, E=14p, F=13p, G=30p, H=24p
=> B has A+B+C + H/2 + 11 (captives) = 54p
=> W has D+E+F + H/2 + 26 (captives) + 6,5 (komi) = 83,5p

That means, W is in the lead by about 30p, if W can keep all his territory at D, E, F and gets all the points at 'G' (which is not decided yet) and gets at least half the points of the 'H'-area.
So it's not easy for B to catch up, even if B has this strong wall at 'K' and sente for the next move and W has many weaknesses.

The good thing of counting is also that you identify areas, that are still open and are worth to be engaged.
Professional players count a game at EVERY single move, but in the beginning it's good enough to count or make a rough estimation at least once in a game (you get a feeling for the best time). Better would be to count after fuseki and before the endgame.

A good and easy trick is to compare territories that are of the same size more by estimation that by exact counting.
That's much quicker than counting every single point.

For example: you could say:
- identify areas: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H -> then compare equal ones
- 'A' is as big as 'F', so they cancel each other out
- 'B' + 'C' are as big as 'D' -> cancel out
- that leaves 'E' and 'G' for W; and no compensation-area for Black, and area 'H', which is undecided
=> conclusion, W could get half of 'H'-area and leads by the 'G' territory, which puts W in the lead.
Simpler, isn't it ?

With this method, you can make a quick estimate, what's the current status of the game in regard of territory.
A precise counting may only be needed at the endgame when the game gets close.]

sum areas:

- W has E+F+G+H+K + captives + komi = 9 + 12 + 13 + 9 + 19 + 29 + 6,5 = 97,5p

JUG: it's interesting to look what happened to one's original plan (W propably wanted to get center-territory), but the game naturally developed into taking corners and sides, even when born out of heavy fighting.
The B player showed a better feeling for the big-points, though not much and often put himself in self-atari.
The W player often played some very good moves locally, but often missed the big points. W played more unanswered moves and captured already dead stones decreasing his score, also giving up sente, though overall you had some good fights.


What helps you most in becoming better are two things:
#---------- 1. improve your reading-ability ----------
The best (and as the most people say, the only) way to accomplish that is by solving tsumego (life & death problems). Typical tsumego are to kill groups or bring groups to life.
Start with very easy ones, problems you can see the solution in 3-10 seconds. Take 10 or more minutes and get yourself ca. 10-20 problems a day and solve them. That will make you better in a very short time. If you solve harder problems, and can't see the solution within 1 minute, better skip it (without looking it up) and go to the next, or decrease the problem-difficulty.

Here are 3 references for tsumego:
a) Get an account for www.gobase.org (take some weeks). There are some excellent problems under  http://gobase.org/studying/problems/academy/ . The first problems can be solved without an account. If you solved the first 400 problems simple glitches like in this game won't happen again.

b) Get problem books. For beginners, i would recommend the following two books by Kano Yoshinori (containing also some joseki and play for fuseki):
* K46: "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 1, Introductory Problems, 30k-25k"
* K47: "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 2, Elementary Problems"

c) A free resource of go-problems of all kind (not only life&death) is http://www.goproblems.com/

To really get better with tsumego, you must use the right approach. That is, reading out the solution in your mind until you convinced yourself you found the correct solution. Then, you may lookup the correct answer. If it's wrong, rethink about the problem why your answer is wrong. This is VERY important. Soon you are able to read ahead several moves.

Knowing about dead and living shapes makes you don't loose your groups in games and enables you to kill opponents groups. By this alone you may become stronger by at least 3 stones or more.

#---------- 2. Learn the basics ----------
That's the more challenging part to learn in go, because you must adjust your thinking.
In your games apply THE-LIST introduced at move #2: 1. am I ok ?, 2. is the other ok ?, 3. where are big areas ?
For each move you play, try to evaluate if it's sente (must be answered) or gote (you or the other can play somewhere else). That will give you the big points and will also improve your game.

I don't like to advertise, but here i make an exception:
To learn the basics of go, you should take some of the "1 EUR Audio-Go-lessons" by Guo Juan [5dan professional\], which can be found at http://www.audiogolessons.com/
Especially for beginners, i would recommend the course "Step by step course". It mainly covers the same basics as i explained in this review, but in greater detail.

---
Phew! That was a long game. Hope this is of some help.

It's also a good idea to play many games. Review them with others or if nobody available, review them yourself trying to identify where you messed up and try to find better moves. This is also a great help. And if you are totally puzzled about a game, send them to the GTL to get some work for us reviewers ;-)

Have fun with this wonderful game!

The groups with the triangles are all alive as they stand ("unconditional live"), because they have the marked points miai to live. That means that if W takes on, B can play the other and therefore live.

The 'K'-group is a "twisted-four", which is unconditionally alive.
The 'H'-group is a "bent-four", which is unconditionally alive (if not in the corner like 'D'-group)
The 'C-'group has more than 4 free spaces not arranged in a "bulk-five"-shape, so it's alive (easy to make 2 eyes).
The 'E'-group lives only because it's 2 eyes at D14 and K12 and all stones are connected with them.

The groups 'F' and 'G' also live in a seki (mutual life). This situation arises when 2 groups split each other (marked with boxes), each outside group is alive. Then the 2 inside groups 'F' and 'G' can't capture each other, because neither can approach without putting himself into self-atari and being captured himself ;)

The 'L'-group is a "bent-four" in the corner, but with the short end not in the corner. Then it lives.
But here's a special case at 'D'. That's a "bent-four" in the corner with the short leg in the corner. That's not unconditionally alive. If W plays on 'M', a ko is starting (you can play on 'M' now to see).]

So making 18p with 14 stones against the 9p with 16 stones in the center.

;W[mo]LB[ic:B][of:A]C[JUG: settle the corner
other possible W moves are at 'A' or 'B', though this is also nice]
;B[ni]TR[da][na][db][nb][dc][nc][de][ne][df][nf][dg][ng][dh]
[nh][fi][gi][hi][ii][ji][ki][li]C[JUG: another big point, also denying the SE (south-east) corner an extension here, so it's a double-purpose move.
Here B has a big moyo (framework), i marked it.
But this doesn't mean that it is Bs territory, it's only potential territory. A framework will normally be reduced by the other player giving each one the half of it.]
;W[lc]C[JUG: reduce widest area now];B[of]C[JUG: joseki-move]
;W[nb]C[JUG: joseki-move (same as in SW (south-west) corner]
;B[oc];W[ic]C[JUG: make a base (now W is alive)];B[fc]C[JUG: help corner]
;W[ok]LB[pi:A]C[JUG: extend from corner and threatens to slide under at 'A']
;B[oi]C[JUG: protect side];W[dh]C[JUG: must reduce (shoulder-hit) biggest area now]
;B[ch]C[JUG: protect side-territory];W[dg]C[JUG: stay ahead]
;B[ej]LB[dh:A][fn:B]C[JUG: split W 'A' and 'B' and attack 'A'-stones]
;W[gg]LB[ic:D][ge:A][ig:B][gj:C]C[JUG: keep group healthy (3 directions to run and 'D'-group near-by to connect, so not easily killed)

... and so on ...])
(;W[cm];B[dl];W[fn];B[dh]C[JUG: B would love this, so W helped B here to develop]

(;B[id]LB[cl:A]C[JUG: another variation (san-ren-sai)];W[cf]
;B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[nk];W[mn];B[nh];W[oc]TR[id][nh]C[JUG: B formed a double-wing, so invade to reduce that]
