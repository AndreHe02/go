AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

thanks in advance for your efforts! Tough I resigned the game after some combat, i would be glad to get some hints about how to handle so many handicap stones. I made some annotations of myself, but I don´t think could have changed the result much with those minor modifications...

Hi, 
My name is Johanna Tuominen, I'm 5 kyu in Finland. Overall you were way too passive in this game. In handicap games you, as a white, should take the initiative more often. 

In 9 handicap game white have to fight against blacks whole board influence. Of course white have to make territory but not necessarily in the beginning, When making territory on the sides, white have also remember the center. Analyzing this game is a bit difficult since it is hard to guess where black would respond. But altogether in 9 handicap game black will do something that you can punish him for (otherwise the number of handicap is wrong). Just have to be patient. Furthermore, In high handicap games it is useful to use fourth line approaches aswell. I tend to mix between the third and the fourth line. The idea behind this is that by approaching always on the third line I more often end up givin black huge center. But the fourth line approaches takes care of the center much better. 

These handigames are unpredictable but I suggest that you could go through some high handicap games between single digit or dan players. I've added some comments and variations. Hope they help!

Enjoy the game of Go]PL[W]
(;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]LB[qc:B][qe:C][ph:A]C[JT: blacks corner is still not secured so thats why I recommend to play some where else. Like those approach moves (see variations). Good attacking points towards blacks corner are for instance A ,B,C. in the local situation. Though white would be more secure if he collects some strength first.]

(;W[jc]LB[fc:A][fd:B][gd:C]TR[nc][jd][nd]C[JT: Not good. This move ended up strengthening black. I would consider playing an approach towards the upper left corner. The whites two marked stones are by no means week. By playing one of those approach moves makes pressure towards the marked black stone.]

JT: There is not much territory defend so I would consider it small move. But giving ponnuki for black is big and stregthens the marked stones too much when considering the upper left corner. So yes. See the variation.]
