;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[ip];W[qo];B[np]C[I would play either a pincer, or P4 after a low kakari, this seems a bit cautious.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[rq];B[qj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf]
;W[ng];B[ic];W[ck];B[fc]LB[cf:A]C[Was A better to avoid big white moyo on the left?

If you want to break up white's territory a bit, A is certainly playable. Your two stones on the top can take care of themselves for a bit. It is not bad to wait however, as you did here. There remain gaps in white's structure.]
;W[df];B[qm]C[Good move, put pressure on white and extend your trerritory, preparing an attack on white stones on the O-line.]
;W[er];B[fr]C[But this is a bit docile. Pursue the attack with S2, force white into the middle and build up strength to attack the O-stones and strengthen your group on the bottom. F2 is small, and there remains a gap around M4]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[oh]C[Now white has the initiative.]
;B[qh];W[ec];B[on]C[Could I kill the white group on the lower right?

You can certainly make it suffer, but I doubt you can kill it. Make sure your attack serves a purpose apart from killing groups. Otherwise, if they get away, you're left with empty hands.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[rn]LB[oj:E][le:D][fo:A][fd:C][di:B][cc:F]C[I considered the following moves and went for E. Was a reduction at B feasible?

If you want to strengthen the cutting point at R8, there are better moves to do that. B is a good move at this point. White is threatenening to build a very big moyo, starting with C.]
;B[oj];W[fd];B[gc];W[eq];B[fo]C[Necessary.];W[fm];B[mi];W[kf]
C[You could consider N14 now, to attack the white group directly.]
;B[ie];W[lh];B[ig];W[jh];B[kj];W[hm];B[jm]C[It has now turned into a battle of two moyo's. You're still ahead in points by quite a margin, so your prospects are good.]
;W[mh];B[dh]C[Good move. Risky, but there is enough space.]
;W[eg]C[Half-hearted move by white.];B[eh];W[bh];B[gh]C[That was easy!]
;W[ni];B[nj];W[ld];B[kd]C[At this point, I was not very clear on what to do and did a lot tit for tat answer

If you don't know what to do, count. You're well ahead at this point, so don't do anything wild, just play conservatively, strengthen your own groups and keep white weak. But don't follow white around.]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[ql];B[pl]C[That doesn't make any sense. Protect your teritory in the middle, connect at R6.]
;W[qn];B[qk];W[ol];B[qm];W[mj];B[om];W[li]C[Bad move. The pay-off of the ko would have been M10, which breaks into your territory. Now you have N9.]
;B[nl]C[Not good.];W[lk]C[Should have been at M8 or N8.];B[kk]
;W[ll];B[lm];W[mc];B[le]C[Strange move, since you defend at L17 anyway and then lose this stone. Better defend at L17 straight away.]
;W[md];B[kc];W[rr];B[pr]C[Small. This would be a good point at which to take back sente. You could invade the top left corner, for instance.]
;W[ke];B[fg];W[in];B[jn];W[go];B[gp];W[gj];B[ej];W[fi];B[fj]
;W[fn];B[gi];W[gk];B[ij]C[Why? This move neither defends nor attacks, and there is no territory to be won here.]
;W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gq];W[lb];B[kb];W[eb]C[Now your chance to invade the corner is gone. You've been following white around too much, and he/she's gaining ground fast. A slack move like J10 can cost a lot of points.]
;B[fb]LB[el:B][cg:A]C[Was A bigger? or B?

A would certainly be big, but you need to defend the top now to hold on to your points and make sure it doesn't get into trouble. It is not securely connected at J10.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[cg];B[bi];W[ah];B[ai];W[bg];B[cj]LB[al:A]C[Was A bigger?

A is big, but you need the connection, otherwise white will cut you off, starting with C11.]
;W[bk];B[el];W[dl];B[dk];W[dm];B[gd];W[fe];B[ge];W[ho];B[hp]
;W[ra];B[sb];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[hl];W[gl];B[cq];W[bp];B[cp]
;W[co];B[bq];W[mb];B[bo];W[bn];B[ao]C[Should be at A4, to make an eye. Then you would have been alive.]
;W[bs];B[dq];W[ep];B[br];W[ds];B[oc]C[Not good, this stone simply goes to waste.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[ob];B[rp];W[of];B[kl]C[Killing the corner is more urgent, starting with S1.]
;W[rs];B[ml];W[hk];B[ik]C[Should be J8.];W[pg];B[qg];W[pe];B[qf]
;W[qe];B[re];W[fp];B[lj];W[mk];B[nk];W[mi];B[oe];W[bj];B[ph]

;W[if];B[hg];W[jf];B[im];W[io];B[jo];W[fk];B[hl]C[That doesn't work.]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[pe];B[gn];W[eo];B[be]C[Could I livae in the upper left corner?

B18 should kill it.];W[cb];B[bb];W[bf];B[cd];W[ba];B[db];W[ca]
;B[dc];W[da];B[de];W[ed];B[po];W[bc]LB[qp:A][ci:B]C[What was bigger: A or B? What is the method to count?

A kills, so it's bigger.];B[qp];W[aj];B[op];W[ci];B[sp]C[Oops! thought T3 was needed to capture whitegroups on the right.]

[an][am][al][ak][ai][ag][af][ad][ac][aa]C[You captured the lower right corner, but by that time you had already thrown away an awful lot of points. Until halfway through the middle game you were ahead, after that you left the initiative to white, allowing him/her to gain ground, and then in the endgame you lost a lot of points by sloppy play. So: more fighting spirit and a sharper endgame should see you improve a lot.]
