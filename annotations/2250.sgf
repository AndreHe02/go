>>
Thank you for reviewing my game for me. This is a 2 stone handicap game i played against a [KGS 15kyu\]. I'm [KGS 20kyu?\]

I appreciate your comments, whatever they may be, the harsher the better ^_^

*My name is Barry and I am ranked as a 10k AGA, and rated ~ 9k on KGS and ~16k on IGS under the name "bconwil".   Please keep in mind that my suggestions and comments may help in some ways, but the advice is only as good as my rank...  I will mark my comments with  *.

Overall, your played a very good game apart from a few moves that allowed your opponent to seize the advantage.  I was impressed with your beginning game and feel for the direction of play.  Some your moves were a little passive, but it it something easily corrected when you gain some confidence in how to attack your opponents weak spots.

As far the opening (fuseki) goes, one of the best pieces of general advice I can offer is from a book I recently read.  The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move? 
    a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."


Try to make your moves dual purpose, such as extending your territory while attacking.  Also,  If there is a move that is gote that you have to make,  try to make some sente moves before relinquishing control.

"sente"- a move to which your opponent must respond 
"gote"- a move to which you opponent can ignore and play elsewhere.]

[id:b]CR[fe]C[I tried a pincer here in response to his approach, was this good, or are there better?

*  I prefer the move at a or b for black instead of at h16 .   I feel this is an easier opening move.  In response to your move White typically jumps out into the middle.  See the discussion at the following website. http://senseis.xmp.net/?CatenaccioJoseki]
;W[hc]
(;B[ic];W[gc];B[id]C[Something tells me there must have been a better way to respond to his attachment. Is there?

*  It depends what you were trying to accomplish when you made the moves.   Its very solid, but the extension is very long and will probably be subject to attack later.  Perhpas your move 8 should have been at k16.]
;W[fe];B[md]C[* It seems you are trying get territory, however, this moves seems high.  Try to balance your first moves.  n17 may have been better.]
;W[qk];B[qg]C[* This move could have been better utilized.  Did you consider this point urgent? It lets white take sente and allows him to make a move to which you must respond.  The top right is already safe.]

(;B[ef]C[* I don't think this move worked very well for you.  If you were trying to attack the top white group you should have made your corner group solid first.  Its good to remember that you should attack from a postion of strength. Perhaps  black should have taken b14 (see variation).]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce]C[* Where should black move?  You took d15.  What about e16?  It would threaten to cut white and gve you sente.]

;B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[gn];W[hn]
(;B[jn]C[* This move is not aggressive enough.   White's bottom center group has a weak shape and I believe you could attack it. Further, the move is gote and does not require white to respond.  Even if you wanted to move at that location make moves that require your opponent to respond.  For example: black r2, white s3.  (see variations starting from previous move.)]
;W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[hm];B[gk]C[* Nice move.  A good extension that could be connected to either of two groups.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[qc]C[* nicely timed attack by white.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[nc];W[qd];B[qe];W[rb];B[rd]C[* Was there a bigger move than this  that would allow you to keep sente?]
;W[rc];B[se];W[ra]C[I get this feeling there was perhaps some way to have killed this group, if not, reduce it to less than what it had taken up at the end. Was there?

*No, this was a good invasion by white and while you could have reduced it some, I would have saved that for the endgame.]

(;B[sc]C[* This was a small move, something for the endgame.  There are many more important points on the board.  For example 011, r2,]
;W[sb];B[sd];W[mi]C[This move bugged me. I was thinking about moving here, but for some reason I decided to finish up with that white group in the upper right.

* This is a good example of making sure you think about which move is bigger in the global scheme of things.]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[mg];W[lg]C[* You next move was at l14.  A nice defensive move, but I feel that white was overextending and you probably needed to be a little more aggressive and cut at l11.  See the variation]

(;B[ks]C[Here is where I felt the game was just comepletely lost. I neurotically placed stones, insisting that if I connected at the end of this, this would have been good. But I turned out to be wrong, and lost all of my handicap advatage at this point.  What would have been the proper response to this?

* m2 would have been the best first response.  This was a very unusual scenario and could have been easily missed.  However, Don't give up hope so soon.  You were not that far behind and sometimes you can make up enough points at the end.  That capture was probably worth 25 points.  Without this loss and the later one it was a very close game.]

;W[nq];B[mp];W[pr];B[lq];W[qs];B[iq];W[hr];B[sh]C[Afterwards, everything felt like I was being pushed, back, and lost major points. I lost an embarrassing amount of stones leading to a 45.5 gap at the end.  I'm content with how I played, but I hope you could help me get a little better. Any and all suggestion would be great. Thank you for your time. ^_^

*** In summary I thought you played a good solid game.  Although you could have been bit more agressive at the beginning of the middle game.

Also, make sure you try to think globally on each move.  Look past the little battle you may be fighting and look for the biggest move on the board.  Those little differences can really add up.

I would also recommend that you study some life and death problems.  Your opponent had some weak shapes that you could have attacked or pressed to your advantage.
