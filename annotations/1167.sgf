(;B[ql]TR[jp][lp]C[question: Bad move ? N5 is better ?

Difficult. I do not htink M4 was good so perhaps  R8 was ok. N5 would have very little effect on M4 and K4 so I would not recommend it.]

me.___Question: r11 is better ?___];B[de]TR[ql]C[The marked stone is weak now. Pulling out the stone in the ladder does not like a good idea even if the ladder was broken. R11 would be a patient move and white would be behind in territory.]

oponent's weak stones, which enables me invading his Moyo.

Magnus: I do not agree because the marked stones already controls the moyo.

But allowing white to play this sequence make it hard for black to get a good result.]

magnus: I think the problem black had in this game came from playing complicated tactical moves at every opportunity. Sometimes the moves works but most of the times a strong player will easily punish these moves.  
Black has to try to find ways of winning in a simple fashion. I did not count the number of nonstandard contact moves but there was a lot of them. Contact moves can often be very strong, but one should never play such a move without a really good justification and after considering other alternatives.]
