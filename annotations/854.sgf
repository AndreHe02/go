C[I played Black in this game, and thought I was doing well.  I was  surpised to see I had lost in the end.  I have no idea what I'm doing  wrong.   At one time I was beating 4k* and 3k* regularly, now I can  barely win against 5k*.

I would like a good review of this game and  where I went wrong.    thank you  shadow.

--------------------------

The overall level of play on IGS has increased by around 2 stones
over the last 3 years because so many professionals are playing
as 4d*. An IGS administrator said that currently around 70% of the
4d* on IGS are professional players. I hope I can help you realize
what you're doing wrong, and thus help you improve.

[ho][no][np][mq][nq][oq][nr][or][ns][os][ps]C[If you can stop playing unneccessary forcing moves, you can improve a lot.
You make very many small errors, and the sum of these is the reason you lose.
Your opponent in this game just makes one very huge error, but overall his play
was better.

You need to study the fundamentals:

Don't play unneccessary forcing move, but leave the aji for later
Don't play sequences that doesn't work (like chasing a stone in a ladder that doesn't work), but leave the aji for later
There's usually only one way to cut, but there are many ways to connect -- evaluate all of them and connect in the most
efficient way.
Attack from your weak side and drive the opponent towards your strong stones.

There is a very good book, "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" -- if you have it, read it again, and if you don't have it, buy it. It's that good.

I'm sorry if I seem overly critical, but after all, you asked "Why did I lose?" -- I'm just trying to answer ;-)

Good luck with your Go!
