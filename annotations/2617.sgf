;B[ok]C[krv: Is P8 better?

R: P8 is usual as it leaves less bad aji, later the cut at Q8-9 may became troublesome]
;W[qo]
(;B[oo]C[krv: Is Q5 or R4 better?

R: the standard way to attack white would be with the R4-Q4-O4 sequence, to avoid white go to the corner,
but with P9 insead of p8 white may be able to settle himself more easily using the aji at Q8]

;W[rm];B[ro];W[om];B[pk]C[krv: Bad exchange?

R: it is just useless, these stones are weak and with this move you're making them heavy]
;W[rl];B[jd];W[dj];B[jj]C[R: a little strange, an approach move at F17 or F3 would be natural
The tengen doesn't seem a big point in this position];W[lj]
C[R: this move is strange, too.
It seems as white is just answering black, but since K10 is not a big point W can just ignore it and play a big move like G17 or G3]

(;B[lk];W[mk]C[krv: Please show me my mistakes in the following struggle.]
;B[mj];W[li];B[oi]C[R: the real mistake is to try and save these stones...
If you want to save them you didn't have to play K10 in first place but escape immediatily
In second place it is really not important to save them];W[ml]
;B[mi];W[og];B[mg];W[kk];B[qi];W[ri];B[qh];W[rh];B[oh];W[rf]
C[R: ait is difficult to say who gianed in this fight
 there was really no need for black to save these stones since W could not capture them with one move anyway, so leaving them as aji would be more interesting.
On the other side the move at L9 is big for White, but it leave a black the possibility to play a ladder block, pheraps playng at M8 insetead of S14 would have been the proper move (honte)]

(;W[kg];B[ii];W[ih];B[fc]C[R: You'r trying to capture W, but it is hoping for too much, since the Black stones around don't seems strong enough
Just Playing F12 is safer];W[gh]C[R: this move is troublesome for B, the H10 stones are weak, and to defend them you weakened the K7, this is why capturing W is hoping for to much]
