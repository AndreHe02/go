C[I am Ginko, playing black

I added some comments on what I was thinking at a some points i thought important.  Hopefully you can correct my thinking where I am off track!]
;B[pd];W[cc];B[dp];W[qq];B[jj]C[I read an interview with Go Seigen where he said this was the best san rensei.  I don't believe I understand enough to see why, but I do like to try it out sometimes.

I thought it would be fun to see how it developed here against 2 3-3 points.

This fuseki is still playable, so long as black can make full use of the tengen to build moyo or fighting.]

[iq]LB[pp:A]C[I tried to keep a coherent, influence oriented opening to take advantage of the tengen point.  I suppose W liked the exchange, since he repeated it.

I found this quite aesthetically pleasing :)

Black is still OK I think, but to play at point A, an attractive spot, (instead of black D10) is possible too, because of the fact that the two marked white stones are lowly placed.]
;W[hc]LB[he:A]C[I prefer black A to build a moyo.];B[ic];W[hd]
LB[jf:A][kc:B]C[Black A can be considered too, this move prevent the invasion for white at B.]

(;B[de]LB[pp:A][ec:B]C[I was not sure of this approach, but I decided to strike out a bit.

Perhaps the lower right corner (black A) is more important (D15 is slightly doubtful as invasion at B is possible).]
;W[ed];B[cd];W[bc];B[ee];W[fd]LB[jf:A][pp:B]C[Is it time to move on?

I was torn between continuing to play locally and playing in the lower right.

Black can choose from A or B, both are good points.];B[bd]LB[ch:A]
[pp:B][jf:C]C[I hoped W would respond to this, but after I played it I thought W would tenuki.

It looks big too as it sort of prevent white from invading at A, but I will prefer to play B (mentioned repeatedly), hoping to get sente, then play C.

Personally, I don't like to play 2nd line move too early in the game.]
;W[dd]TR[cd][bd]LB[kc:A][ce:B][cf:C][pp:D]C[Did I get lucky?

Maybe white should consider A, since cut at B is not big, black can always play C and give up the 2 marked stones.

In this position black should play D to further restrict white's territory to the 3rd line.]

(;B[qo]LB[op:A][ql:B][cl:C][ch:D][kc:E]C[Once again, I am unsure how to approach.  I need to work on 3-3 point joseki!

Google on "Kogo Joseki Dictionary", you will find the resources you need :)

Actually, white to reply at A is fine, black has to play B, white got sente to play C, D or E.]
;W[qm];B[pq];W[pr];B[qr];W[oq];B[pp];W[rr];B[or];W[qs];B[nq]
;W[nr]C[Not a good move, white should rather use the aji of the ladder at later stage.]
;B[op];W[os];B[mr];W[oq]LB[mq:A]C[Black should play A or even tenuki, N2 stone is light and can be sacrificed.]
;B[kq]C[This is sort of thin.];W[or];B[mq]LB[fo:A]C[White should play A to reinforce.]
;W[cr]LB[gq:A]C[Aji at A for black.]

;W[pk];B[of]LB[jf:A]C[Maybe black A better.];W[rc]LB[jg:A]C[Black A is better.

Think twice before you play 2nd line move.];B[qb]LB[jg:A]C[A bit too submissive to me, white gained in sente this way.

You should play at A instead.];W[co];B[cp];W[cf]LB[ce:A]C[Black can play A and make white C14 a "thank you" move, as white remove the cut at A...]
;B[cg];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[df];W[ad]
(;B[jg]C[Now I start to lose my cool a bit.

This move is OK.];W[nj]LB[ln:A]C[Black to play somewhere around A is perfectly OK.

The moyo on top can only be reduced but not completely destroyed, so it is no big deal.

Black is still leading, so you need not try anything drastic.]

This is a good move too, white can't cut at O4 now.]))

This is OK too, or say black K6.]))

Look OK to me.]))

Yes, this is the correct move, nevermind about the empty triangle.]

OK to me.]))
