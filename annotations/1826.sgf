C[yoyoma [4k\]: hi
Altair [3k\]: hi
yoyoma [4k\]: Dear reviewer, please take a look and make some suggestions about where I could improve my game.]
;B[pp]C[yoyoma [4k\]: oops forgot i was black
yoyoma [4k\]: haha];W[pd];B[cp];W[dc];B[iq];W[ce];B[jc];W[hc]
;B[mc];W[oc];B[pj]C[can't say this is wrong, but it is inconsistent with the prior two black stones - after w p17, b should play n15 to stabilize the group and to keep white from getting much on top or the right side

now w can attack at some point from above if w wants outside influence or from below if wants to put the group in motion or from the left if wants territory on the top left]
;W[cj];B[pf]C[wrong direction - leads to giving w a splitting attack against this stone and the group at top.  
Better would be r13 - solid, strong, not provoking, reducing w.

or even d6 or e4 or p4 all look better - more consistent with building strength at the bottom.

think of it this way - you already have a base to reduce the w framework, so if the game becomes one of who builds the best and biggest framework, b wins easily.]
;W[qf]C[yoyoma [4k\]: I didn't expect this reply, I assumed white would try to split black, although maybe the attack is not severe enough?

w is thinking of settling for a stronger attack later, perhaps.  But the splitting attack is better.

though this solidifies w and makes b a little bit too cramped and inefficient - b would now want the stone on Q10 at Q9.]
;B[qg];W[qe];B[pg]C[now Q10 is too close to the two stone wall.]
;W[nq]C[good move, correct approach.  tough response for b - simply extending seems too passive; attaching on top settles w in a big way against the b stones on the lower left, perhaps best is simply p3 since b cannot build a big framework on the right because of the settling of the upper right corner.

if b allows w to dive into the corner, then b becomes increasingly overconcentrated.]
;B[np]C[yoyoma [4k\]: I chose this continuation based on the high Q10 stone, and the fact that J3 is already in place.  Good choice?

see comment on possible responses to white.

this would be ok if the three stones above Q10 had not been played yet.

but it is certainly playable and I don't mean to criticize it too harshly. It is ok here, just perhaps not showing quite enough full-board thinking.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[op];W[mr]C[Ok.  Now what do you want to do - were you taking the corner or building the right side?  where is the one move to build the right side?

n5 - though that strengthens w a bit and weakens b j3 - but w is already strong here so strengthening w is no problem.]
;B[qq];W[pr]C[too small for w -allows b to solidify on lower left]
;B[eq]C[good, though I like the high one-point-jump here - since j3 is low and since if then w approaches at c6, the attack at c8 is much more severe.]
;W[cn]C[sssss [22k?\]: dunno
yoyoma [4k\]: Retorical questions, aimed at GTL reviewer :-)]
;B[hd]C[yoyoma [4k\]: First I lean on white to gain some strength

ok - but you lose f17 or the threat of f17 while making w strong on both sides of your weakest, but no longer weak, group.

what is the follow-on?  do you want to leave with sente or is gote ok?]
;W[gc];B[cl]C[yoyoma [4k\]: Since white responded peacefully, now I start this invasion.  Is this a good way to handle this position?


Ok.  look at sealing w in with a play at O15 - and add a stone at n5 - and now you make sense of the three stones on the upper right, the three stones on top, and the conservative move at e3 instead of e4.  W must respond by invading or reducing the framework or else b wins easily with a series of capping moves

By playing here, you have forced w into the very space you would want to use to make a framework]
;W[dm];B[dj]C[simplest is probably best here - d9 - fair fight with chance for b to create two weak w groups with b running toward friends and w running in a b space.

the attach here leads to settling w quite easily, losing the stone on c8 - if this was the plan, better would be just play d8 immedietely and skip c8 or play d8 now then dodge up to d10]
;W[ci];B[di];W[dl]C[yoyoma [4k\]: It gets pretty tactical here...]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[ch];W[bh];B[bg];W[cg];B[dh];W[bi];B[bn];W[bk]
;B[bm]C[yoyoma [4k\]: Black succeeds in cutting some white stones.]
;W[dg];B[gi];W[gl];B[eg];W[ef];B[eh];W[ff];B[il]C[this has turned out a bit better than you deserve, because w has played so conservatively

57 is very good.];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq];W[hk];B[ii];W[ik]
;B[hf]C[a significant mistake by b.

you must keep up pressure on the w group by playing k8.  the center bl group is in a fair fight - w isn't settled yet either and b can run to friends top and right.

now w will settle easily and have strength to keep the b framework small.]
;W[jl];B[me]C[yoyoma [4k\]: Black has a large moyo, but it is pretty thin...

perhaps better is to play L10, threatening j7, so w must respond there - and then back to 015 -  which gives you a sizable and solid moyo]
;W[pl];B[ok]C[yoyoma [4k\]: Any other ideas you have for handeling this invasion?

What do you want to do?  take points with your moyo?  Attack the stone?  Build strength somewhere?

I would actually play j7 here];W[ol];B[nl]C[this looks good , but leads to complexity - are you ahead or behind?  Do you need to play like this or can you just take the points?]

;W[qm];B[pn];W[sn];B[qp];W[ri];B[rg];W[pi];B[oi];W[rk];B[sl]
;W[sm];B[sj];W[si];B[hp];W[ho]C[I don't understand the point of your play here.  If you were going to let w live, make w live small and take points.    I think better would have been to chased w out with b taking the side points and keeping a target.]
;B[io];W[hn];B[co]C[small - take the points in the moyo at L10.

or push into w at g16];W[jp];B[ip];W[in];B[mo];W[lp];B[rd]C[yoyoma [4k\]: Another tactical sequence...

the right play here is usually r17 - then make w capture it three times as you take points outside.]
;W[re];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[se];B[pc];W[nd];B[ob];W[nb]C[ok, you again got more than you should - b was dead inside if w 112 was at p18]

;B[pe];W[qd];B[od];W[oe];B[rc];W[ji];B[jh]C[lots of weak moves by boths sides here - but too complex to comment on online.

I would look to playing simpler, fewer cuts - though b has come out of this much better than w

41 should be at k10 - but since you are now well ahead, safe is ok.]
;W[ki];B[kh];W[li];B[ij];W[jj];B[kk];W[jk];B[kl];W[pk];B[mh]
;W[om];B[ln];W[mb];B[db]C[this can't possibly work - not enough help, too settled all around.  simply pushing in with g16 and j18 should be sufficient.]

;W[na]C[what happens with b e9?

I think it doesn't quite work - but e10 is very strong, giving b a few points.]
;B[oa]C[The game is very close now, so it is more clear that the invasion at the upper left corner was not necessary - simply taking some points was enough.

and the point at e10 is actually large now - giving b about 3 points in sente]

[as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][ss]C[Need to learn a bit more about tactical fights - often you can play a bit more simply until you can read out what is going to happen.  As you play stronger players, you would get severely punished for the tactical omissions and overplays.

But the thing you can improve most easily perhaps, and what was most apparent was the inconsistent strategy in the late opening- early middle.  This is very hard to believe and to learn, but if you just can see the relationship of all the stones and learn to estimate the value of teh points and power a bit better, w would have been done early in this game.
