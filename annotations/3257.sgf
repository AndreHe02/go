C[Hi, 

I supose you're the black player, so I'll review for black :)

I'll focus on the weak and strong groups, where I think you made many oversights. White did play very abuseively and got away with far too many weak groups. Other than that, that was a nice game to review, and you played some very good moves. 

Le frog];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[nc]C[This is unusual. The corner approaches on hoshi stones are deemed non-urgent. In other words, white wants to have fun :)]
;B[lc]LB[dd:A][pj:B]C[This pincer here is more efficient when there is a blck stone on the other side, as a hoshi stone in the corner (A). Furthermore, one usual continuation of this pincer being san-san invasion, here it wouldn't be as nice for black, because there's no black stone around (B). See variation]

(;W[ne];B[pf];W[qn]C[White is playing strangely really :)];B[ql]
LB[ng:A]C[In this case, the pincer feels better than in theprevious case, because of the black stones in the corner. And if white ever pushes further at A, for example, then black will be happy to play on the side. If whites later tries an invasion on the side, this stone might help.]
;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[Here, I must say that usually, on attaches to the stone that isn't pincered, with the joseki shown in thevariation]
;W[dd]TR[le]C[White acts like he can hold sente forever, but he's played many tenuki, which black should now take advantage of. Especially the marked point looks promising]

(;B[cn]C[THis approach is not urgent. The urgency order is 1 - settle your weak groups, 2 - threaten your oponent's weak groups and 3 - approaches. In this case, I think the group at O17 needs a little tickling.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[cf]TR[cj][dj][dk]C[This is too wide. The usual proper extension is at C10. The marked stones need to be a little lighter,as they're heavy on their own, and would be in trouble if white attacked them around the marked points. In fact, here white can make a good pincer.]
;W[di]C[Which he doesn't miss...];B[dg]TR[di]C[I am not familiar with this response, I've seen it with komoku approcahes, but more rarely with hoshi. I suspect this might give too much easy territory to white in the upper corner. And for the marked stone, it can extend easily below. On top of that, black B16 doesn't make life like it would in the corresponding position shifted one row up (with a komoku stone rather than hoshi).]
;W[gc];B[ic]TR[nc][ne]SQ[ck][dk][cn][dn]C[This play doesn't put much pressure on the white stones at O17 nor on the isolated white stone at D11. I'd suggest t first play D9 or C9 to stabilize the C6 stones.]
;W[bd];B[ck]C[Good];W[cj];B[fn]TR[kp][lp][lq]SQ[dk]C[I don't like this move, as it helps white on the bottom, and might prevent a future black pincer around the triangle points. On top of that, white has an easy good shape move at D9.]
;W[ip];B[lp];W[no]TR[fn][ip]C[If what you wanted was to pincer, then the marked exchange has been good for black. You shouldn't have payed it. Now white can play this and be strong because of the white triangle stone.]
;B[jo];W[io];B[ln]TR[dk][io][ip]C[The irony is that black is struggling now, while the white stones were the ones that were weak in the first place. And if white extends the J4 stones, then you'll miss not having played D9.]
;W[nm]
(;B[qi]C[If you wish to defend the corner, getting thin, you might want to play a combination like P6/Q2]
;W[im];B[in];W[hn];B[jn]TR[hm]
(;W[gn]C[I'd play H7 as white here];B[ll];W[nk];B[ie]TR[le]
[dk]C[what about M15 ? or D9 ? They both seem better to me. This move doesn't threaten anything.]
;W[pb];B[ng]C[I don't understand this answer. R17 would make white lacking a life base. Now if white plays R17, he is alive without any problem and got away with another weak group.]
;W[dk]C[At last...];B[el];W[ek];B[fl]C[I understand the willingness not to let white connect, or the willingness to get the black group out of here. however, all white groups except O3, etc are a live now. Not all blacks are (C14 D13)]
