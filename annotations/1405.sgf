C[Andre: Hi, this is a real-life game I recently played in a tournament. I recorded the game afterwards from memory, but I think it is exact (to the point where it ends). I think I handled the lower left badly and was too ficed on the attack of the center group, but any specific hint is greatly appreciated. Thanks!]

;B[op];W[nr];B[mo]C[Up to here the game follow standard patterns: nothing to complain for either side.]

(;W[rq]TR[nr]C[But this move is way too slow. It is possible to play it instead of the marked stone, but than it has a completely different meaning, because it is intendet to secure the corner. After w played the marked stone the corner is allready secure: Thus there is no need to add another stone. See the variations to this move for furher explanations.]
;B[fc]C[The summary of the previous is: your choice to play tenuki here was correct.]
;W[jd];B[gd];W[df];B[db];W[nc];B[lc]C[Andre: Is this invasion too early? I thought "Strike while the iron is hot" :-).

Well, the problem with hot iron is: It can handle a strike quite flexible... :-)

What I mean is, there are only two white stones. If w could not think of anything else, but making a group out of these two stones at the top, then the strike would be excelent. But there are alternatives, see var.]

(;B[pc]C[Andre: I chose this direction, because I didn't want the centre group to get away easily.

The center group comes away when you block at the other direction? Let's have a look...]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[nd]C[Andre: Maybe Q14 or P13 (which I played soon anyway)?

Agree. this move seems to be way too slow.];W[cj];B[if]C[Andre: Is this good or can White make an intelligent sacrifice there?

B is so strong around, w is really forced to play tenuki here. This b move is overconcentrated. I make an experiment to show you why. In the variation node, I have deleted the 6 w and 6 b stones, let's see what happens]

(;W[je];B[og]LB[qg:A]C[Very good! You threat the new heavy group at the top (w played there and showed you that he cares about it) and you threat to shut in the top-right group later with A. Two birds with one move.]

(;B[do]C[This move does only exists if these stones are a row lower, i.e. c3 at c2 etc. See Var. for joseki.]
;W[bp];B[ep]C[Andre: I didn't want to connect (shape) and didn't like the idea of ko, so I switched the side.]
;W[dq]C[Funny, capturing the stone would be the only thing that comes to my mind...]
;B[kj]C[Andre: I thought I can treat the stones in the lower left lightly...

Difficult to say what to play in the lower left, I don't like the b stones there, but don't see a good continuation either. l10 is definitly a nice spot.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[ko]LB[fn:A][co:B]C[Andre: I liked it when I played it, but I got into trouble.

Yes, you have a real problem now. I think it all doesn't help, you have to push one more time with A. The sad thing about all this is that the stones are definitly no longer light after that and B becomes absolute sente for w.]
;W[fn];B[hi];W[hf];B[ig]LB[he:A][hd:B]TR[if]C[Why not cutting at A? I don't see a problem. Do you fear B? In that case, how about sacrificying th marked stone directly?]

;W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[dk];W[dn];B[dj];W[ck]C[After you lost the left side you are behind, thus you cannot play normal endgame, but have to think about something special. What comes to mind is the endangered w group at the top. Let's see if it might be possible to kill it.]

(;B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[lh];B[qg];W[rf];B[ce]LB[hq:A]C[Andre: Is this big enough?

;W[gr];B[fl];W[rm]C[Andre: In the end, I lost quite big (16.5 points), more than I thought. So, where did it all go wrong :-)?

Yes, that's roughly what you are behind now, it seems you even gained something in the endgame.

I think the game was about even until you played the non-existing "joseki" in the lower left. This costs some points and the handling of the poor b stones who ended up beeing there did the rest. If you want, you can call L5 the losing move.

You may wonder why I "allowed" w in one position to gracefully scriface some stones and why I say in another position that sacrificing stones is the losing move. For this I want you to compare the positions after move 42, 47, 57. After move 42, w's group is very heavy, with no eye potential and with very strong b positions all around. A burden as big as a burden can be. After move 47, w is outnumbered 2:1, b has the initiative in this corner. Due to the wrong joseki after 57 it is w who has a good position. Nevertheless the b stones can easy escape, at moderate costs, because some friends are around. Thus, no need to sacrifice them.

Another point: Look at your right side moyo. You remember, your initial strategy was to build a moyo there. Of course you have to be flixible and change ideas when better opportunities arise, but I think you gave it away for too few. Q17 is the main mistake that caused this.]

All in all, the position isn't bad for w now, but you are back in the game.]

(;B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[co];B[bp];W[ep]LB[er:A][bq:B]C[B continues now with A or B. In this case I would suggest B, because the left side is more important than the lower side.]

(;AE[ic][jc][kc][lc][nc][id][jd][kd][ld][nd][ke][le]C[Do you think the actual played stone is well placed?

Ok, maybe this question is a bit unfair. But what I want to stress is: Think bigger. Your move might be (locally) a good kikashi, but globally seen it is a small gote play. A kikashi is nothing worth, if the opponent does not answer it. See var. for a better w play.]
