C[Hi

Before I begin the review, I'd like to apoogize for the delays, most of which were due
to a bug in the sgf editor i used which could not save this game properly

Second point is, when in the main game I'll start all my comments with "j>" on the line
so they are not taken for kibitzes. When in variations, I'll simply add a few notes if needed

Hope this review will be helpful];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[jq]
C[j> I rather play this stone on k4 to make a san ren sei, which is more influence oriented
(and you said later you wanted to go for center, then play on k4 is best)]
;W[cn]
(;B[co]C[I adopted this more conservative  joseki because I wanted the sente to  play at the right side...

j> The problem with this move is that it enables white to have perfect extension on the left side
(thus a perfect left side)
See variations.
If your only guide in choosing joseki is sente or not, and you want sente, then simply tenuki
eason for this is : white can depart from joseki you know, and you end gote]
;W[dn];B[fq]C[j> this must be played on f4 and not on the third line, where it puts no pressure
at all on white];W[dj]C[j> White now has a perfect extension from his two stones wall : 2+1=3 spaces before extension
And his left side is ideal

I think even with the stone on f3 white can enter the corner at 3-3 and devstate it]
;B[qj]C[yep I did it...

j> sure, but at which cost ? you gave white a perfect side, and because white C6,D6 and d10 formation is  solid, your lower left corner is open]
;W[jd];B[qf]C[maybe I should have played at K10  we were both center orientated

j> there's a major difference between black and white in the game : white has all stones except one
on the 4th line. He plays for center.
On the other hand, Black has 5 stones on the 3rd line. This is more territory-oriented.

In spite of this remark, k10 is attractive, and maybe i'd play it, depending on my mood]
;W[nd];B[rd];W[qn]C[j> this stone *must* come under severe attack]
;B[qo]C[j> good];W[pn]
(;B[nq]C[j> bad
must play on o4 (see variation) to pressure white];W[qh]TR[qj]
SQ[qh]C[I tried to make this  stone (X) become a  weak group and made  the next move to try and  gain sente...

j> maybe r8 is playable here, to get some base for your marked stone on r10, which will soon become
very weak else]
(;B[qc]C[j> this move is sente only if white agrees to answer]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[pi]TR[qj]C[j> you lost sente here (same remark as for joseki choice in the very beginning)
black's triangle looks lost in a white zone];B[pj];W[oi];B[ol]
TR[qh][oi][pi]C[If I coul run or get strong  a 2 way attack at the  marked stones look  ideal.

j> problem is the white  triangle stones are already out, and lots of allies wait for them  near the center
also, if O3 was at O4 the two W stones on Q6 would be under more pressure]
;W[nn];B[ql]LB[rk:A]C[good shape... thought it  made life

j> it's enough to have a base on the side
life is another question cause it requires two eyes, and there's only room for  one. For example a white stone at A (S9) can link to allies with s11 or s7 later]
;W[po];B[qp];W[np];B[op];W[mp];B[of]C[now my double attack

j> this would be a real double attack if your four stones around r10 were really strong
white has forcing moves against them (s7 for example) that reinforce white]
;W[mq];B[nr]C[Saving my corner

j>  corner was not endangered for living, only for a few points]
;W[pc];B[qb];W[gd]C[I can see my group at  right-top is a little weak  ... but I thought he had  much more problems  than me at this point

j> so you must attack his weak stones while reinforcing yours, or expanding your influence
(n14 or n8 maybe ?)];B[cg]C[so I invaded.

j> i think it's best to invade when you're behind in territory and have strong positions,  or when you're completely behind
if you think you have a good position, simply improving it is best than risking a huge
fight resulting from an invasion];W[ce];B[bj];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci]
;B[bi];W[dg];B[cj]C[j> bad
must defend against white b13 which removes base on the left side]
;W[cf]C[j> b13 better for white i think];B[dk];W[bg]C[j> now black has merely one eye on the side]
;B[ek];W[cl];B[ck];W[fn];B[ho]LB[hq:A]C[I was afraid of a pincer  around (A)

j> A is not a pincer
if W plays A, you can ling K3 to the right playing M2

for white on b8 see a few moves later];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl];B[fk]
;W[gp]C[Now I saw the defect but  thought it to be minor...

j> B must say goodbye to H5 and keep the side, i think];B[go]
C[j> g3 better in my view];W[im]LB[bl:A]C[j> W at A (B9) instead would have caused B lots of trouble
B would then have to choose between answering at A12 to have one eye on the side,
or to ignore this stone and seek two eyes in the center];B[bl]
;W[ip];B[fp];W[hp];B[fo];W[iq];B[lr];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[hm]
;W[hl];B[oo]C[exploiting his bad  shape... maybe it could  wait... secure the  left-bottom corner?

j> Cutting at J8 is much more promising and would cause W lots of problems]
;W[on];B[no];W[mo];B[mn]C[j> embarking in a huge fight
maybe better to play n14 to create weaknesses in W upper side when he tries to save
stones on the right];W[mm];B[ln];W[lo];B[lm];W[ml];B[ll];W[lk]
;B[kk];W[mk]LB[kl:A][ko:B]C[I thought this position a  long time... and made a  stupid mistake... maybe   (A) or (B) ??

j> I'd play A or K8 (didn't try all variations)
K8 is also a peep against the cut at J8 so it has my preference]
;B[nm];W[kl];B[kn];W[km];B[ko];W[kp];B[jp];W[jo];B[nj]TR[qh]
[oi][pi]C[seeing my mistake I  went for the kill on those  3 marked stones.  Perhaps the cut was  dangerous .. but it was  the awnser I expected  him to make.

j> hoping to kill white is unreasonnable cause you must make life for your stones too]
;W[oj]C[here it is... :)];B[nk];W[ok];B[pk];W[nl]C[j> all over for black]
;B[lj]
(;W[jn]LB[om:A]C[This was a surprise I  thought (A) was a very  worse cenario... for me

j> see var to check the result];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh];W[mi];B[mj]
;W[li];B[kj];W[ng];B[nf];W[mg];B[lh];W[mf]C[He lived but I had plans  for the midle board and  some influence at the  upper side...]
;B[qi]
(;W[pg]C[see variation];B[oh];W[og];B[ph]C[j> White has been very nice here]
;W[pf];B[qg]C[Well then the right side  was a thing I couldn't  hope to win so far...]
;W[pe];B[jk]C[j> useless
cut directly at j8 if you want to try];W[il];B[hk];W[ki]
(;B[kh]C[j> wrong direction
better to give two stones and make the center a no man's land, playing at k11]
;W[ji];B[jh];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[gh]C[I should have run it to  the end...

j> what for ???  to put more stones in a row under white influence ?]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[gi];B[fh];W[fi]C[j> blacks stones in the center are very weak]
;B[ei];W[ig];B[gf];W[jg];B[if]TR[gf][if][hg][fh][gh][ei]C[By this time I had my  group dead and was  trying to live with  absolutely nothing worth  those 6 stones. Very  lucky he played bad.]
;W[jf];B[je];W[ie];B[hf]
(;W[eh]TR[ih][jh][kh][lh][mh]C[This was completely  wrong... he should have  killed my (triangle)  group and maintained  the center let those  worthless stonews  meat... ? they weren't  even alive yet..

j> even with this, black still has trouble];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf]
;W[le];B[kg]C[j> problem is that even now, a white stone on K14 means black has only one eye in the center]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[di];B[id];W[ak]C[what was he wanted  with this?

j> looks like an eye-stealing move, but black can link with j9, or extend
his space with b7 etc... so it doesn't work
if white is only a little more solid below , a9 kills];B[ik]
;W[me];B[kd];W[cq]C[This was my worst  played corner of the  game in my opinion...

j> see comments at beginning of the game
corner is open];B[cp]C[j> i don't know all variations on the corner invasions
i believe this (c4) can't be played now cause Black has no space out]

better to give all the corner directly to white];W[ep];B[cr]
