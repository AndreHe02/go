C[Hikaru128 [7k\]: hi have fun
decade [6k\]: have a good game

Thank you for reviewing this game.

I am black - 7k (i'm not sure if I'm really that strong).
My opponent was 6k.
This game was difficult for me. In the end I won just because White made a mistake and lost his group.

Hello,

I think you begin the game well but you need to work out your " whole board vision" of the game.

You have many opportunities to break in white center and reduce it to just a few points, but you where keeping on answering his moves : try to ignore your opponent's move if you think there is a bigger move to play elsewhere. I also wrote some comments along the game.

Enjoy the comment,

White has a slight but confortable lead in the yose. It is solid everywhere, so nothing should happend.

(Exept if white is comitting suicide as he did with his upper group)

That s it.

I hope it helps  ^_^]))
