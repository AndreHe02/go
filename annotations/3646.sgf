C[Hello, I played white in this game and won by 1.5

Even though I won, i think i could have played a lot better and missed many good moves in the game.

It would be valuable to get a stronger player to comment on some moves.



Many thanks,

Neil

Hi,
As you won the game, the review may also contain comments on black mistakes.  
janr];B[dp];W[pp];B[pd];W[dd];B[pn];W[np];B[nn]LB[qi:A]C[janr: this black move is not optimally effective, as the right side is still open to invasion,  Coinsider now e.g. white A]

(;W[qf]LB[qh:A][qi:B][lp:C]C[Here, black A would still allow black to extend from his two stones pincering at the same time.
I think C is the most quiet move, developing on the 4th line.  Even if black makes a moyo on the right, o6 is not the biggest point.

White B is another possibility];B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[oq]LB[nn:B]
[lp:C][rq:A]C[s3 correct?

janr: the joseki is at A (locally, if B is not present)
When attacked, it is very easy for black to live now by playing A himself.
Alternatively, C is an answer to B.];B[qi];W[qd];B[qc];W[rc]
;B[pc];W[re];B[jc];W[md]C[
This is too aggressive.
There are still many big points on the board.];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]

(;B[oi]LB[hg:A]C[Stay ahead in a running battle.

(;B[ge]LB[mb:A]C[
This is quite slow and painful

Consider A ?];W[fe]
(;B[gg]C[I prefer hane];W[ff]
(;B[gf]LB[hh:A]C[
empty triangles should be avoided.  I would prefer A];W[hi]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dg];B[fi]C[
This is very solid.]
(;W[di]C[
It looks like an overplay again.  c11 is the normal move locally]

(;B[fk]C[The variation is more active.];W[ki]C[was the last 20 moves ok?

janr: whites attack was more successful than expected.];B[lj]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[kp];W[cq]C[

This is dangerous as black may get a big center.];B[dq];W[cp]
;B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]C[the connection is probably a bit slow.]

(;B[jl]LB[hl:D][jl:C][hm:B][mq:A]C[
'A' becomes a bit sente move for black now.

I prefer B (or D) above C, as now white runs more easily into blacks moyo]
;W[hm];B[dh];W[ch];B[ci];W[bi];B[cj];W[bj];B[cg];W[bh]LB[bh:A]
[ci:B]C[
If white answers at A then in return for the weakness at B, black can not follow the game variation.  He should either capture two stones or start with a probe]
