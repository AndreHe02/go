(;B[hd]TR[di]CR[pc][cp]C[See variation for joseki.
A note on D11 and H16 stones : both 4th-line stones facing the 'wide' side of a takamoku (4-5 stone in the corner). This side tends to be less important than the 'narrow' side of the takamoku because of the typical continuations from a 3-4 kakari against the 4-5 stone (marked points). the 4-5 stone typically gets thickness cacing the 'narrow' side (for example, the Q15 stone is likely to get thickness facing the right side), and the 3-4 kakari stone gets a lower position and safe territory. In that case, the marked stones would not be effective. Try it out.]

[pk][qk];B[hg]LB[fi:a][ck:b][dk:c]C['a' is preferable as it has a continuation at 'b' or 'c'. H13 emphasizes the W group being a cutting group. Sort of the feeling you get from the black pillar in the center seperating the 2 w stones, compared to the white pillar seperating the corner stones.]
;AE[jl][il][ik][hl][im][ok][pk][qk];W[id];B[ie]LB[ic:a]C[W 'a' now captures the B stones. B should just play 'a'.]
;W[jd];B[if];W[ib];B[cc];W[ec]LB[cb:a]C[ 'a' is better and safe.]
;B[cd];W[cp]LB[dl:a]C['a' is better as it prevents B from using his thickness.]

(;W[hc]LB[eb:a]C[W can still tenuki without too much damage here (see variation) - try it out, W wins semeai easily , but if you are going to play here, play 'a'.]

[pl:b]C[B could take sente by playing R3, W Q8 and attack the 2 white stones by C9 or D9. B invested a lot to get the thickness in upper-left, and it would be a lity not to use it. If W gets D8, the thickness becomes ineffective.]
;W[qq]C[If W wanted a corner base, then R4 is the move in the first place (instead of Q5)]

C[ w should attack, not defend. P13 is a good start. The square-marked group is still vulnerable to attack, and as W builds power by attacking the triangle-marked group, at the same time getting safely out to the center, an attack on the squares becomes more deadly. Almost always prefer getting out to making such painful moves.]
;B[nf]LB[oh:a]C[overplay, encouraging W to split B. This move seems to sacrifice the 5 black stones . 'a' almost settles one group, so the other one is likely to live too.]

;B[mn];W[ok]LB[mm:a][lm:b]C[gives B a perfect opportunity to defend his weakness. better to push at N7 twice, then play around H4. B will not have a fatal or very fruitful attack against this W group - M14 stones make sure that any wall B builds in the attack is not effective.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[go]C[Good. The game now looks a little better for B. Note T14 saves the B stones there (endgame 12 points)]
;W[nn];B[no];W[kn]LB[io:a][dl:b]C[J5 is a better reducing point, but D8 still bigger.]
