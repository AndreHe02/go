C[*X*: (Before reviewing) Hi Chris.  My name's Alex... I'll be prefixing my comments with "X" for Xopods, my usual username.  I'll try to look for large-scale problems in your game, as requested.

(After reviewing): The biggest problem I see in your game is a failure to understand when a "light" move is actually light, and when it's merely thin.  Having come to appreciate the benefits of light play, it's easy to get addicted to light-looking shapes... but there are, of course, times when solid play is called for.

Maybe it's easier to see the difference between thick and heavy than it is to see the difference between thin and light, so before choosing a loose move over a solid one, ask yourself whether you would consider the solid shape "thick," or "heavy."  If the solid move is going to be thick, you want to play it.  If it would be heavy, then you want to play the light one.  Playing the light move when you could have been thick is a mistake.

The two main places I noticed this were moves 17 and 75.

There are also a couple of points where you failed to put the  maximum pressure on your opponent - moves 31 and 93.

In the end, though, you lost the game by making an unneccessary defensive move when there were many huge endgame moves to be played.

Hope this helps.

Chris: Dear Reviewer, I played Black in this game. After the opening was over, I felt Black was ahead because of a faster opening. I am not too comfortable handling moyo games, so any pointers where my biggest weaknesses are ("meta-comments") would be much appreciated.

C[*X*: I don't see anything wrong with this move, but you could also play at R10... then White would be forced to enter your moyo around P4, because a play there would be too good for you.  The goal, then, would be to try to end in sente (which you should be able to do, since you have White vastly outnumbered) and get the first move on the top side, which would be tedomari.]
;W[df];B[jd]C[*X*: I think the area around R10 is larger... given that White answered at D14, you can probably treat F17 as a probe and tenuki.]
;W[dr]C[*X*: Okay there, buddy.  Black R10/Q10, game over.]
;B[pj]LB[fq:5]C[Chris: Black has developed much faster in my eyes.   Should Black 5 be strengthened now, considering the influence white has built? I thought B5 was expendible.

*X*: No, you did the right thing.  B5 is, as you say, totally expendible.  Just remember that when he attacks it, and you should have an easy game now.]
;W[hq]
(;B[ip]C[*X*: This seems okay to me... but if you aren't comfortable with an omoyo game, maybe you should leave it for later... keep other moves as options.  You could also just jump to L5... make sort of miai of P4 and H4.]
;W[hp];B[in]C[*X*: Just J5 would be fine, but I can't say this is wrong.]
;W[op];B[pq]LB[pn:A]C[Chris: Maybe A is better.

*X*: I don't know what's best.  You're probably right about A, though.]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[po];B[oo]C[Chris: I thought I needed to put up the biggest fight I can.

(;B[qi]C[Chris: Is this move too slow? It felt like correct shape.

*X*: I would have attached at S10 to seal White in.];W[ql];B[pk]
;W[kn]C[Chris: I thought this must be overplay.

*X*: Sure, but there's no way White's going to win this game by playing reasonably at this point.]
;B[ho];W[gp];B[go];W[fp];B[jl];W[jo];B[io];W[ll]
(;B[lm]C[*X*: I don't think you need to cut.  You're very thick to the right, you could just continue pressing White towards your wall.]
;W[km];B[kl];W[mm];B[lk]C[Chris: Shutting White in seemed to be of greater importance than continuing the attack to me.

*X*: You're still winning by a mile, but I think you let White off too easy.]
;W[ml];B[lo]C[*X*: I think this is aji keshi.  It doesn't gain much and you never know if you might prefer to play N5 or N6 later instead.]

;W[mk];B[lj];W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[mj]LB[mq:A]C[Chris: Better take profit at A?

*X*: No, White gave you a second chance. N10 was good.];W[kp]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[nq];W[no];B[nn]C[Chris: Since I was reading a long time beforehand I wanted to play sente. Of course this is very bad.]

(;B[rj]C[Chris: This move was slow and ineffective. Better places to play?

(;B[gg]C[Chris: Again I felt like I need to attack as strongly as possible.

*X*: Well, you have to live, first and foremost.  But yes, attacking the cutting stones is the best way to make life in this situation.

However, I think H13 is better than G13.];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi]

;B[hj];W[hh];B[jh];W[ig];B[jf];W[ie];B[id];W[dh]
(;B[mc]C[*X*: I think this is a wasted move.  White should not be able to live in your territory with you so thick all around.

This could be the game-losing move, since there are large endgame moves to be had - O10, for instance, and D18 and H7.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[mi];B[li];W[oi];B[oj];W[nh];B[nk];W[nl];B[ok]
;W[ol];B[ph];W[hm]C[Chris: I cannot find a way to save these Black stones. Should I have protected this cut beforehand? If yes, when?

*X*: As I predicted, N17 turns out to have been the game-losing move.  Given that you lost by 10.5, being first to get D18, O10 or H7 would have been enough to make the difference.]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[fn];W[hn];B[cc]C[*X*: Not the right time to tenuki: F7 is a pretty big double-sente move.]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[cd];B[cb];W[be];B[ac];W[db];B[bb];W[ga]C[Chris: From now on, only endgame is left. I lost in the end by 10.5 points.]
;B[gb];W[fa];B[ha];W[eb];B[hb];W[nc];B[md];W[fm]C[*X*: You shouldn't have let White get this.
