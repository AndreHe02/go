Hello Davpek,
     First of all, I would like to point out that it is a crime that someone rated eight stones higher then you took black and didn't even give a komi of 5.5.  Don't let anyone do that.  :-)  I have added comments under four dashes wherever you have had comments, and have done my best to give adequate commentary on the whole game.  If you have any questions or disagree with anything, feel free to contact me via e-mail.  I hope this review doesn't seem overly harsh, that was not my aim.
    I noticed three main things wrong with your play.  Probably the most obvious one was a tendancy to be overly protective of your groups.  I counted at least twice when you jumped to secure life for groups that weren't under serious danger and still could have run into the center and improved your whole board position.  Once you played a very small move to protect a small number of stones when they were really almost incidental to the position.  It would be a good idea for you to stop and think every time you feel like struggling for life to see if the stones you wish to protect are really in serious danger, and if there is any other way to get them out of it.  Struggling for life can often be more trouble then it's worth.  Additionally, you should think about wether your really need the stones you are trying to protect.  There are two relavant go proverbs in this area.  "Don't protect worthless stones" and "Capturing stones doesn't win the game, losing stones doesn't lose!
  t!
he game"  Some times it is best to just sacrifice some stones instead of trying to save them.
    Another thing I noticed is that you seem to have a hard time seeing how all the groups on the board interact with each other.  This is understandable, it is one of the hardest concepts to understand in go, but it is also one of the most important.  It would be profitable to stop and think at any pause in hostility to analyse how you might better be able to get your stones to work together.  Practice makes perfect!
    Lastly, you need to practice making judgements on the value of a move.  Often times you will play small moves when there are many more very big moves left on the board that your opponent should not be allowed to have all to himself.  Again, another thing to think about during your games.  I hope this review is helpful!

LB[qc:A]C[Consider playing this move at A instead.  It keeps black out of the corner, and you need not worry about the crosscut.  The cutting stone will end up caught in a ladder because of the marked stone.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[of];W[oe]LB[qf:1][nd:A][jd:B]C[i guess 1 would have been better?

This move is not the best way to protect the upper side.  For one thing it creates an empty triangle which is a very weak shape, and your opponent could have exploited this.  (See variation on next move.)  For a better look at the weakness of the empty triangle, go to the following URL: http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheEmptyTriangleIsBad
Instead, consider playing this move at A, which produces a resiliant shape which is hard to cut.  Additionally, a play at a would aim at an extension to B, which would give you a firm hold on the upper half of the board.
The cut at 1 is also an option, although it is a more violent way of resolving the situation in the corner.]
;B[rc]C[You get off easy, black does not exploit your defect.]
;W[pc];B[nf]C[How could I have prevented blacks
wall towards the right side?
---
-
The wall in itself is not a terrible thing, as you can see it is rather far away from the lower right star point.  It is how you play against it that matters.]

(;W[qn]C[I tried to invade the right side,
but achieved the opposite.
What would have better?
---
-
This move was your first serious mistake and it was fairly severe.  You did have the right idea though.  Black's moyo on the right side does need to be put in check before it becomes too expansive.  This is not the right move for it though.  It presents black with a golden opportunity to convert his influence down the right side into real territory.  Blacks strength on this side requires a lighter invasion.  See the variations for another idea.]
;B[qk]MA[sc][qf][qg][qh][qi][qj][rj][sj]TR[qn]C[The pincer is very severe.  Just for referance, with this one move, black has surrounded 12 points of real territory, and that is just a conservative estimate.  In addition to this, he is also attacking your approach stone.  So he is accomplishing two things with one stone, a very effective move.  The marked stone will have to seek life, while black can continue to attack and make profit.]
;W[pm]LB[on:A][ok:B]C[I did this to prevent black thickness
towards the center
---
-
This move is another mistake.  This move is far too slow and heavy for this situation.  It allows black to grab even more territory while keeping up the attack.  Your stone is not under severe enough attack to warrant this kind of heavy play.  The standard continuation in this situation would be the one point jump to A, but this again would not be great as black can give chase at B, further enlarging his terratory.  Careful consideration of the situation would show that the best thing to do would be able to somehow stop black from continuing to gain territory and influence with his strong group on the upper right side.  There is a go proverb that states "Your opponents good move is your good move.  The capping play at B would be a decent move in this situation.]
;B[ok]MA[rj][sj][pk][oi][oj][oh][og][sc]C[Black keeps up the pressure and expands his territory by yet another nine points, for a total of 21.]

(;W[nm]C[Panicking and fleeing towards the center is not the right attitude in this situation.  Take a look.  Black has three stones in the area for your two, that is not a big disadvantage.  On top of this, your stones have a strong connection, so lets use this to our advantage.  It's time for a strong counter attack at the point where black is weakest, the star point stone.  A high approach move from the other side of the side star point would be very effective.  See the variation.]
;B[on];W[om];B[mp];W[rp]LB[jd:A]C[To ensure live of this group...
----
Not nessissary.  You can still run into the center, so now would be a good time to play a bigger point like A.  As you will see, the resultant fight lets black build up strength along the lower section of the board.]

C[Whith this move, hostilities have stopped for the time being and now would be a good time to take stock of the situation.  At this point you have successfully surrounded about 12 points of irreducable territory.  Your opponent has surrounded about 29 points of irreducable territory.  So in terms of raw territory, you are about 17 points behind.  In terms of influence, your stones at the upper right corner cast influence across the top of the board, and his stones in the lower left cast influence across the bottom part of the board.  Additionally, blacks group on the right side has a little influence in the center and is in a position to support an invasion of the upper part of the board.  It is very clear that there is some catching up you need to do.

There are about three big points left on the board, A, B, and C.  These aren't nessissarly the exact points to play on, but rather the general area.to play in.  Let me rank them in order of importance.    Probably the most crucial point at this stage of the game is A.  Considering that white is behind, let us see what happens if either player plays here.  If white plays here, he takes advantage of his strongest group of stones to solidify his claim on the upper side of the board.  It would expand his moyo and make it fairly difficult for black to invade anywhere except near the upper left corner.  If black is allowed to play here, he has strong support for his group on the right side and can easily destroy what little influence white has on the board right now.  All of whites groups will be more or less locked in and black will be able to throw his weight around.  Clearly black cannot be allowed to play here.

B is probably the next most important point.  If white is allowed to play here, he has little or no support, but would't have too hard a time establishing himself.  If black is allowed to play here, he will get a firm grasp on the bottom of the board, but it will be fairly inefficient, as he is playing fairly close to his thickness.  This is a decent place to reduce black in the future.

The least important point by far is C.  It isn't a bad point in and of itself, however, given the whole board position at this point in the game, it will not do much for either player, and only give thier opponent the opportunity to play at a more important point.]
;W[dj]C[Unfortunately, you chose the least important move.]
;B[dl];W[cl]C[This is not a good way to play.  I will explain why in several moves.]
;B[cm];W[ck];B[dm]TR[mp][nq][or][pq][pp][oo][on]LB[gp:A][dl:1]
[cl:2][cm:3][ck:4][dm:5]C[This last sequence was almost like a corner joseki, however white clearly comes out on the losing end of this.  Black's four stones on the left work perfectly with the marked stones on the right.  The last thing you want during any part of the game is for your opponent to get two opposing walls of influnece.  Blacks lower side desperately needs to be reduced.  If he is allowed to build a secure moyo in between his influential groups it could end up worth upwards of fifty points, not a healthy proposition when you are already trailing.  However, any stone dropped between his two groups far enough to have be of any effectiveness will most likely come under immediate severe attack and will have to run for thier lives with a poor chance of surviving while black happily chases, solidifying his territory all the while.

The required response to blacks move at 1 would have been to invade and reduce his territory somewhere near A, to keep him from building up so much influence.]
;W[fj]LB[dg:1][jd:A]TR[nc][pc][qc][pd][pe][oe]C[Would something around 1 have
been better two prevent the next two black moves?
----
Something near 1 would have been better, but I'm pretty sure a play at A would have been even better.  One of the most important concepts in go is to make your stones work together, and your marked stones are being woefully underutilized.  A play at A would expand white along the upper side, and create a double winged formation about the star point in the upper left, making it moreresistant to attack, and suddenly you have three groups of stones working together.

The move you played seems somewhat aimless, and blacks next two moves do very well to wreck what little amount of framework you had.]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[fd];W[hc]LB[hd:A][id:B]C[The pincer here was the right idea, however the low pincer is somewhat ineffectual.  A pincer at A or B would have worked better with the stones you have in the upper right.]
;B[dc]C[is there a standard joseki for this
situation in the upper left?
----
There probably is, but you are at the stage right now where you shouldn't worry about joseki.  A good many pros state that ameteurs cling to much to joseki, "relying on them like sacred cows" without really understanding them.  Right now what is needed is to read out a situation and respond as best you can given the whole position before you go learning josekis, that way, once you know them, you can properly apply them.]
;W[cc];B[de];W[db]TR[dj][ck][cl][ej][fj]C[This is the wrong direction.  The marked stones are both the weakest, and easily reachable group.  You should be fighting to reach them, because if black can seperate you from them, he will have two weak groups he can harass simultaneously.]
;B[ed];W[cd];B[eb];W[ec]LB[cf:A]TR[ck][cl][ej][dj][fj]C[This does not get you very far.  At this point, treating the uppermost stones lightly is a much better option.  I would have played at A, letting black get the small points so that you can attempt to connect with the marked stones.  Your primary concern right now should be to strengthen your groups,  instead you are scrambling for small points and will let your opponent get even more points as he gains strength.]
;B[fc];W[fb]LB[jc:A][kd:B]C[Again, this is the wrong direction.  Black is walling you off in the corner, and next he will be able to play an invasion around A.  Instead consider ceding a couple of points to black and protect your upper right with a play at B.]
;B[ea];W[gb];B[kc]LB[hd:A][id:B]C[Here is the invasion. You get off very lucky, black could have turned this into a hard fight.  You can also see how  if your original pincer stone had been at A or B, black would not have been able to get away with something like this.]
;W[dc]SQ[eb][ea][fb][gb]TR[dd][cd][cc][db]LB[cb:A][cf:B][he:C]
MA[hc]C[this is small but i thought it was necessary to kill the marked black stones and thus secure life of the marked white stones
----
Again, small things are the least of your worries right now.  You are still behind and you need to play aggressively to catch up.  You won't really have to worry about the triangle marked stones, because if black takes ko, you can play at A and you are pretty much guarenteed life in the corner.  Losing a couple of the stones is very small in comparison with what you can do on the rest of the board.  Two things to consider at this point would be to try and connect your two main groups on the left by playing near B, or to launch a counter offensice by jumping out to around C.  This would threaten black on both sides.  It is important to keep an eye on your stones marked with as square, they have the potential to attack blacks invader so they are serving a purpose.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[ce]C[This move hurts.  He has now cut off your group in the middle left from your live group in the upper left.]
;W[be]LB[ip:A]TR[fj][ej][dj][ck][cl]MA[kc]C[Small play.  There are too many big moves to be playing here.  A couple of them would be to try to reduce blacks area surrounding A, or to try and give the marked stones more room to live.  Doing something about blacks marked intruder is also high up on the priority list.  It could connect to his group on the right with relative ease, and it is close enough to a number of your weak points to tear your position to shreds.]
;B[bf];W[bd];B[cg];W[ch]TR[fj][ej][dj][ck][cl]MA[kc]C[again I am trying to ensure life,
again he is building thickness towards the center...
----
This group has two options right now.  Fight for life, or run.  Right now running would be the best option.  It would not have a hard time getting into the center, and then it can either  try and connect with your stones in the lower right, or the ones on the upper side of the board, although this second option would be more viable if your upper side were stronger (again, if you had played a higher pincer so black couldn't invade), and blacks marked stone is poised like a wrecking ball waiting to destroy your territory.]

;W[al]C[this move is not necessary, i guess
----
No, it isn't.  Your attention really should be focused elsewhere.]
;B[am];W[di]LB[di:A][dk:B]C[A waste of a forcing move.  This move gets you nothing.  A and B are miai, that is if black plays at one, you can play at the other.  You net gain here is basically zero, so it is a waste move.  On top of that, it could have remained as a ko threat, which would be useful if you got embroiled in a ko fight elsewhere on the board.]
;B[eh];W[bj]C[necessary?
----
This definitely ensures the life of the group, however the group is not in immediate dange of dying because the route into the center is still open, and it gives up sente.  In this position on the board, allowing black sente is just too costly.]
