C[Hi, My name is Johanna Tuominen, I'm EGF 4 kyu.
Some comments: Occasionally, you're moves were bit too slow, especially in the beginning. You played locally good moves while black was thinking more the whole board situation, which resulted more influence and bigger moyo for black. There are some comments and variations in included. Hope they help. Enjoy the game of Go!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]
(;W[dj]C[JT: The D10 move is possible... But in my opinion it's a bit too slow. I would start approaching the blacks sanrensei. See variations from move 5.]
;B[fq]LB[hp:A][ip:B][jp:C][hq:D][iq:E][jq:F]C[JT: Pincer is also possible here.]
;W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[kc]C[JT: I would prefer the three point extension to K16 instead to L17. That is if you don't want to slide into the corner right away.]
;B[oc];W[nd]TR[kc][nc]C[JT: These stones are a bit overconcentrated now.]
;B[jj];W[go]C[What about g5? Wanted to threathen a cut...

JT: It is Ok. However, it would be better if black didn't have stone in tengen (K10), because the the influence what white creates is weakened right away.]
;B[dr]
(;W[hq]TR[np][nq]C[but I think this cut could be cut... -.-

JT: Or maybe to save the cut later and approach to the lower right corner now.]
;B[jq];W[io]C[
so I protect it, ok?

JT: Now it is more difficult for you to approach the corner (mentioned few moves ago). And black is not dead yet in the corner. Black can live for instance by playing C3.  So therefore it would be easier for you to approach the lower right corner before black have an opportunity to play something like K3.]

JT: The invasion was ok. Directly to 3-3 point is also possible.But that was the result where you invasion ended anyway.]

(;W[qh]LB[mh:A][oh:B]C[this was just a try; saw it in some other games ^^*   at least it's aji ;)   is it possible to invade there, or on 3x3? is it necesarry?

JT: I would make the 3-3 invasion because it is safer. It is not easy handle the marked white stone now since black is so strong in the area. It is right invasion point if black do not have the two stones (A and B).]

Could you enumerate and show my general mistakes, please? Do you have any other comments or general adives how to play? What are my weaknesses?

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(;W[mb]LB[lb:1][md:2]TR[ch][dh][fh]C[JT: two eyes...  This would be whites game if you could capture the three marked stones. But unfortunately it is not possible... (If black plays right). Because white had to defend the upper group in gote, black will have sente and the urgent move for black is to rescue those marked stones.

Of course, if black plays somewhere else then white can capture these three stones, for instance by playing F14. Then wihte would be little ahead but it would all depend on end game.]
