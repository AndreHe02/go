(;B[fq]C[sronen71 [10k\]: Q: How is this move compared with E3 (variation)?

Canbek — There isn't much of a difference between this move and E4. It's more like personal preference, but at all times going wider always leaves you more open to invasions. I personally prefer E3, but as I said, this move is basically the same value.]
;W[ce]
(;B[cg]C[Canbek — Pincering is this position is good, although D13 would squeeze white better.]

(;W[cc]C[sronen71 [10k\]: I did not know  the joseki
sronen71 [10k\]: Black has an enclosure in the south west corner, so
sronen71 [10k\]: the pincer at C13 is  a good way to make territory on
sronen71 [10k\]: the west side by attacking]
(;B[de]C[sronen71 [10k\]: black move D15 is not know to me as joseki

Canbek — I've seen this before, but I have no idea how to respond :p]

(;W[cf]C[FreeSpirit [10k\]: play...

Canbek — This is a little passive, pretty much making him stronger.]

(;W[kc]C[sronen71 [10k\]: I played L17 since I wanted to limit black territory on the top left

;B[kb]C[Canbek — Yuck, disgusting probe.];W[lb]
(;B[jb]C[sronen71 [10k\]: is M16 better then M17?

Canbek — Well let's look at some variations.]
(;W[lc];B[jc]
(;W[jd]C[Canbek — Slow. There are a lot of big moves. He has some influence, albeit it is thin in the top left.]
;B[id]
(;W[je];B[ie]C[sronen71 [10k\]: J14 may be an overplay for white?

Canbek — Not really, but K14 would've been better (followed by a cut on the top left group).]

(;W[if];B[jf]C[sronen71 [10k\]: this cut looks good for black
 
Canbek — It is alright, but it's not a huge cut.]
(;W[kf];B[jg]
(;W[le]C[sronen71 [10k\]: I played M15 since I was worried of b L15 or L16
sronen71 [10k\]: but maybe this was not necessary

Canbek — You could've solved this with one move. (see move 30 variation 2)]
;B[hf];W[kg]C[sronen71 [10k\]: K12 looks better instead of J13?

Canbek — I'd play K12 instead because it's worth more points.]

(;B[ig]C[sronen71 [10k\]: J13 doesn't look like the correct move for b]

(;W[jh]C[sronen71 [10k\]: I hane and black cuts again

Canbek — Hane too slow. There are bigger moves available.]
;B[kh]
(;W[ki]C[sronen71 [10k\]: now I decided to turn black inside my moyo

;W[sb]C[Canbek — This game was good, although both players played a little recklessly. I believe you did a good job dealing with his foolish "cutting-every-single-place-possible" tactics. However, you played a little too passive and should attack more often. If you have any more questions regarding anything dealing with this game or with how to study, contact me.

I also play on KGS under the name "lovely". I try to be on, but lately I haven't been able to do so, so if I do get distracted, please wait a few days for a reply.]
