C[J: I will proceed all my comments by "J:".  I am currently rated 4k on KGS and a 1k AGA.  You played more of a moyo game, which is not my style.  I gave  my approach to playing the Low Chinese openning, but it is not the only way play.

J: I hope the comments help.  If you have any questions, you can email me at jag_home@hotmail.com.]

;W[cp];B[ic]C[J: I tend to approach at this point.  A high 3 space approach.]

(;W[iq];B[dj];W[cl];B[pj];W[dh];B[fj];W[fh];B[em];W[ed]C[Another move I was strongly considering here was F5,
but I decided to try to do some symmetrical damage, rather than defend.

J: I think where you played was much better that F5.  F5 is not good shape and could cause problems in the corner.  

J: E16 is attacking the corner and providing eyes space at the same time.  If you can do 2 things at once, it is usually a good move.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc]LB[dd:B][hd:A][pf:C]C[J: (A-H16) doesn't threaten any groups or territory.  You should try to settle the stones or play else where.

J: It is always easier to live on the sides and in the corner.  You could press black into the corner and get a base on the side.  See variation at (B-D16). 

J: B might be a good way to approach the upper right corner and also provide help to the upper left group.]

(;W[hd];B[df];W[ef];B[de];W[ff];B[di];W[ci]C[J: I don't like C11.  You should have just played straight down at C12.  By staying connected at C12 you give your heavy group options. You still block black from getting eyes on the side and provide a options for C8.]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[ch];W[cj];B[bg];W[dk];B[fi];W[dn];B[ek];W[dm]
C[J: At this point your upper group has become a liability.  Black can pressure you to live small and get a large wall to surround a large moyo.  If you had a settled white group you might have been able to attack the black group, but now any attack will just weaken you white group.]
;B[hi];W[en]C[J: This is a risky move.  It allows black to have a strong attack on you.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[jh]LB[ji:A]C[J: Black got greedy and has made himself weak. He should have played (A-K11).  Black is attacking for the kill not profit, which allows the game to stay close.]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[hh];B[hj];W[jg];B[kg];W[jj]C[J: This is an excellent move.  You have created lots of weakness, and now you should take advantage of it.]
;B[kj];W[jk];B[il];W[kl]C[J:This move is slow.   You are too worried about those stones. It will be very hard to kill black.  It allows black to start repairing his weaknesses, which he does.]
;B[lj];W[fm];B[fl];W[el];B[gm];W[gn];B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[ln]
;B[jl];W[kf]C[J: This is a good move to take advantage of the weaknesses.]
;B[lg]
(;W[ke]C[J: This is a thank you move.  You made black do exactly what he wanted.  See better variation.]
;B[jd];W[io];B[km];W[lm];B[ll];W[kn];B[kk]C[J: This was a good series of move that provided a good solid moyo]

(;W[jn]C[I'm thinking that this was a wasted move.  Probably I should have taken sente and gone at R8?

J: You are right that this move is not needed and that sente is much more important.  I think that the upper left corner is important to take now, rather than R8 see varitation.]
;B[qn];W[pn]LB[qq:A]C[J: Black should take the corner here.]

;B[na];W[oa];B[pb];W[ma];B[pa];W[qb];B[na];W[ra]LB[sb:A]C[J: The corner is dead (A-T18) kills it.  No white stones should live in the in the upper right corner.]
;B[po];W[oo];B[op]
(;W[np]C[J: This is a  mistake.  As you played it, you should lose the whole corner.  I look to see what black could have done.  You should have played under, see variation]
