As a matter of fact, G9 was a mistake in the first place, because it allows B to cut at H9.

G9 is not important, your group H8, J6 and K3 is more important, because it is enclosed between two very strong black groups, and will be very difficult to save.

Thanks for reviewing this game.  If there are any general comments on weakness or strategy and tactics, I would greatly appericated.  Thanks again.


Ok.
You obviously played a B player stronger than you were.

The game was lost when you played R17 instead of P15 (stone NÂ° 34)

Even if you had not lost many groups, B would have had an easy game in the centre.

Then, your 3 weak stones (see stone 71) ended up dead, as Black thought they were.


Black had an easy game because you let him cut your stones. This is the main point you need to work on. Build solid (I don't mean thick) shapes, and you game will improve.

Also, learn to recognise dead shapes, you will play usefull moves elsewhere instead of trying to save already dead groups (andthus, reinforcing your opponents shapes)]
