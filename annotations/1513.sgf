C[To Reviewer:
First of all i want to thank you for reviewing my game. I´m sure that this will improve my play a lot.
My name is Andreas and I played white in this game. I´m about 28k and I lost by 5.5 moku.
I haven´t got many questions because i´m not yet very familiar to the game.
But i hope this won´t stop you showing me where my weaknesses lie.]

C[Was this move OK, or should i have played D10?

I think D10 is probably better.  Now Black could jump in around there, and he may wind up with a large territory in the center.]
;B[dj];W[cg];B[dm];W[bo]C[Good response? Or should i have played in the middle at G7 or G10?

I don't think any of those choices are very good.  I kind of like K10.  Give Black some trouble making a center framework.]
;B[bn];W[cn];B[cm];W[bm];B[bl];W[an];B[al];W[bj]C[Here White takes Black's base away, forcing him to run into the center.  From his initial placement on the fourth line and his influence to the right, Black was after the center anyway, so I don't think I would help him take it.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bh];W[ch];B[ck];W[di];B[cj];W[ei]C[White's last two moves were good.  White gets out into the center, and the Black group is now in serious trouble if it doesn't run.]

;B[kp];W[kq];B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[mr]C[These moves are too small to be made at this stage of the game.]
;B[nq];W[nr]C[Crawling on the second line is a bad idea.  For each move, you are getting one point, while Black is getting a very powerful wall facing the center.]
;B[or];W[ip];B[ki]C[This is a big move for Black.  Look at the difference if White moves here instead.]
;W[lh];B[li];W[mi]LB[kf:C][lf:A][kg:D][mh:B]C[White should have played at A to make a solid shape.  He has cutting points at B, C and D that are too close together.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[nh];W[kg];B[mj]C[Look at the big territory Black is getting in the center.]
;W[ne]LB[io:A]C[A move at A would be much better, it would help to limit the size of Black's center territory.]
;B[io];W[hp]C[Did I loss territory by that play at the bottom?

This is the right move, but the move before that gave Black a lot of territory.]

;B[hj];W[gi];B[cc]C[I think, the following sequence made me lose this game...

I think you lost the game because you didn't get out into the center and reduce Black's framework.]
;W[cd];B[dc]LB[ec:A]C[The standard move here is A.  I have added a variation showing the usual sequence.]

(;W[bc];B[bb];W[ab]C[Very bad move i thought after i had played it, A17 or A16 would have been a lot better...

A17 isn't very good.  B16 is probably best.];B[ec];W[bd];B[gc]
;W[gb]C[This move is too aggressive.  H18 would be better if you want to secure the territory at the top.  Black's group could still die if you play there, as well.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[eb];W[cb]LB[fd:A]C[If you play at A, Black is dead.]
;B[db];W[ba];B[fe]C[I didn´t realize that weak point

Yep, Black catches the stone in a net, and all of his stones are connected.]

;W[oe];B[pe];W[od];B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[sd];B[qn];W[nf]C[Was there any opportunity to kill black in this sequence?

No.  All you did was help his finish his wall, and donate a large group of your stones.  There is a variation at move 115 that shows a better sequence.]

;B[tt]C[Did I concentrate too much on the corners, so the enemy could gain a lot territory in the middle?

Yes.  You lost this game in the opening and early middlegame.  I pointed out multiple opportunities to get out into the center.  If you would have take advantage of one of these opportunities, Black's center territory would have been easily cut in half, and you would have won by 20-30 points.]
