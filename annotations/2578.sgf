;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[op];W[mp]C[RGW: I'm terrible at remembering joseki myself, but my Dictionary of Basic Joseki says that this move "is played very infrequently.  It seems a little to close, but it is the severest attack on [the\] approach move."  This doesn't make it very clear if this move is good or bad.]
