C[D:  Hello, my name is Darrell and I will be reviewing your game.  I am 4-5 kyu on KGS.

Good game.  Interesting fighting.

Your primary weakness is that you pick fights where your opponent is strong.  Try to make your groups strong and attack him where he is weak instead, and your game will improve rapidly.

Hopefully you are using an SGF viewer where you can see the variations as they are not all marked with comments.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.];B[qd];W[cp]
;B[dc];W[qp];B[de]C[This is standard frameworking, right?

D:  Yes, this is good and normal.];W[eq];B[pn]LB[oc:C][od:D]
[op:A][oq:B]C[D:  This is a funny move.  I don't really like it.  You are asking white to attack this stone while making territory on the fourth line.  Any of ABCD are more natural.]
;W[op]SQ[oq][pq][qq][rq][sq][or][pr][qr][rr][sr][os][ps][qs]
[rs][ss]C[Just like this.  White is profiting while attacking black.]

(;B[ro]C[I think I lost the corner here... wasn't sure how to approach the R4

D:  You seem to want to take away white's area.  This is not uncommon among beginners, but it is not reasonable.  Your opponent is entitled to *some* territory.  You should just work to get a bit more than you let him take.

See variation for an idea of how this might be played differently.]

;W[rl]C[Telemakhos: not starting out so good :P];B[rk];W[rp]
;B[sl];W[oq];B[nl]C[D:  Actually, this came out reasonably well all things considered.  White got a fairly large corner and a wall facing the bottom center.  Black got a little territory and good influence into the center and right.]
;W[pr]C[This was a wasted move for white.  It had the same value as "pass".]
;B[nn]LB[oc:B][jd:C][od:A][cj:D][dj:E]C[D:  Once again -- much too greedy.  Do you think white should get NO territory?  You are attacking white's strongest stones.  Better moves are marked.  See how they start making huge territory and how they work together with the other stones you have already got on the board?]

(;W[so];B[sm];W[lp];B[om]LB[kc:C][oc:D][cg:B][cj:A]C[D:  I like this move as it exerts great influence on the lower center of the board.  White should just ignore this move.  The stone you have ataried is not worth saving.  Any of ABCD would be good for white.]
;W[oo];B[bn]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[
Fourth line for influence (like A)
Third line for territory (like B)

D:  Good move by white.];B[ld]C[Pincered too far?

D:  No, this is good.  Good move.];W[md]
(;B[nd]C[D:  Complicated.  Learn to play simpler.  You shouldn't really be trying to kill white here.  You want to attack the white stones and profit from the chase.  Killing is surprisingly rare in go.]
