C[Hi

During the game, I had the feeling that I have no chance. Looking again at the moves, I realized that some moves could be better, and that overall the game wasn't so a disaster. Please, could you point the real loosing moves?

I was Black. But also, if you spot some real good W variations let me know.

Thx, Radu];B[qd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pq];B[od];W[pj];B[de];W[fd]
(;B[ch]LB[cd:A][ce:B]C[Is this fair enough? Should go further?

c12 is ok 
A  is a large point for whoever takes it
an option to c12 is to play at c17 to settle the shape but lo leave the aji at A is also fair play]

(;W[fq]
(;B[cn]C[Again, is that fair enough? What about a pincer, or larger move (d7)?

so far so good
d7 leaves the corner still open but it is an option];W[jp]C[W played larger. What about h4? Is that too early?]

(;B[qo]C[I usually jump inside opponent moyo pretty soon. Like here. What time is appropriate invade like this? Should first get free points, like k17, r12?
it is a matter of taste and skill
however is better to come for the borders
the risk of invading too deeply is that white can get thick while attacking a weak group
deep invasion are usually white tactic

[hp:A]C[I didn't realize how weak is my upper right corner. Because opp didn't play there I considered it strong enough. My mistake.

at this point black should consider an invasion at around A or expand his corner at B
the problem with B is tha it is gote although a large one]

that is gote and white has the chance to play wherever pleases]

Thank you for your time
Radu

to play toward the center is good 
you problem is lack of concentration and reading practice
your ideas are good but need to read more carefuly])
