C[This game is from tournament held in Prague on 21.1.2006.  I am reproducing it from memory, so it is possible that I made some mistakes in move order.  I play black. I am 6k European rating, 8k on kgs.

I have written ideas that lead me to play the way I did at some moves (especially in fuseki).  I would appreciate if you could comment on whether these ideas are reasonable or not, and whether there are better/alternative ways how to achieve the stated goals. Of course, if you see anything else noteworthy, please tell me as well.

Thanks in advance.

Hello, 
My name is Neil Mclean and I am a Scottish,UK player.
I do not know if I can give you good advice on this game. I am 5k KGS and 1K IGS, about 2k European. So I am not so much stronger.

Anyway I will try, and perhaps you can get another review also.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]C[I don't like moyo games, so I decided to split the white's side.

NM: This is my favourite opening as black, I play at F17 now and depending on white there are variations]

(;B[ci]C[NM: I'm sure this is playable, why not C10 though?
If white C13, black C8 then white C6 and black is not good.]

(;W[od]C[NM: This is playable, lets black have miai on left side.]

(;B[mc]C[NM: In Whole board thinking in Joseki, this is wrong joseki choice because D16 white is on 4x4 point. And fight is not best for black because of D16

Whole Board thinking in joseki recommends P17 attach to take territory.]

(;W[qc]C[NM: This wrong white choice also]
(;B[rc];W[pc];B[re]C[NM: Black takes little territory]
(;W[md]C[NM: O15 is joseki here.
N16 helps black more?];B[ld];W[me];B[kc];W[po]C[NM: This is big move but not urgent. More urgent at top? 
because black can tenuki and attack white first, perhaps f17/f16 first then p14? To make white shape bad.]
;B[qo]C[NM: I'm not sure of joseki choice here. perhaps black Q8 high, so to help attack P16 group and extend R16 group.
R5 is good I think too it takes territory.];W[qn]C[NM: White mybe better play Q4, since white D4 is good position.
This way R6 limits D4 potential];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq]C[NM: Can White extend R14 first? mybe it is overplay.]
;W[qj]
(;B[gc]C[NM: I dont like this move. It is not severe enough.
F16? 
But black still leads so it is not a bad move.];W[cf]C[Now I need to do something about c11 stone. I considered two ideas shown in the variations (or some similar results).  I chose overextending to c6, since it seems more active choice to me. Black in the game replied in a way that helped me, I think.]

(;B[cn]C[NM: I think it is over C6, since c11 can always jump to centre]

(;W[dn];B[dm]C[NM: Yes, this helps black to have a safe group. White needs territory so should look to attack more]
;W[en];B[co];W[cp]C[White invasion on c9 is still possible, but I think I can keep white busy for now and protect on say e11 later.]

(;B[fq]C[This move would not cause w as much problems as I hoped.  Perhaps playing at f4 would be better?]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo]C[I expected something like the variation.  White's choice seems weird to me.]

(;W[er];B[ep];W[do];B[cl];W[jq]C[This seems a bit small to me.  It does not really endanger anything, and lower side is open anyway.  So I tenuki.

NM: Black is ahead in territory, K5 is probably best played now though, white must answer black K5]

(;B[db]
(;W[fe]C[NM: I really dont like this move, the shape is bad.]
;B[cc]C[NM: letting black here is almost game over. This is huge, worth 17 points?]
;W[cd]C[There is a weakness at e18, but I should be able to live in corner even if I get cut, so I ignored it for now, and went back to the plan to try attacking p16 group]
;B[nc];W[of]
(;B[qg];W[eb];B[fb]C[I missread this and believed it connects.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[dc];B[ea];W[cb]C[It does not, but I can still reduce the corner in endgame like in the variation, so it is not that much of a problem.  Worse is that d16 group is now quite strong and cannot be attacked.]

(;B[jo]C[Not much idea what to do now, so I decided to attack the lone k3 stone and see what happens.]
;W[lq];B[mo];W[hr];B[fr];W[mr];B[nr];W[io];B[kr];W[kq];B[hq]
;W[gr];B[fs];W[iq];B[ip];W[jp];B[hp];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[in]
C[The lower left corner got weakened, which I like.  The cutting group (h4) seems a bit weak now, but I believe I can escape with it without major problems.  So I still try to keep l3 group weak, in hope I will get stones around o8 and that I will be able to threaten q6 group.]
;W[mn]
(;B[nn];W[mm]
(;B[lo]C[NM: This only helps white I think];W[km];B[nm];W[ro]
C[I don't like just answering this move passively.  I tried to split white at r8, but it does not work.]
;B[ql]
(;W[pl]
(;B[pk]
(;W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[rp];W[pj];B[pm]C[This move now looks weird to me now, the obvious variation looks quite good for white.  Perhaps I made mistake in the order of moves as I remember them from game.]

(;W[om];B[ol];W[ok];B[ml];W[qm];B[on];W[nk];B[nl]C[Nevertheless, this definitely is the situation that resulted.W now attacks the g4 group.]
;W[jm]C[NM:];B[im];W[il];B[gm];W[hl];B[gn];W[gl]C[I could run out, but this seems to weaken c8 group and help white make some center territory, so I rather make eyes and let her close me in.

Right choice]
(;B[ho];W[ei]C[I am not really sure about this move -- it was something like that, I did not consider necessary to answer it. I can now cut off corner.]
;B[em];W[bo];B[bn]
(;W[dr]C[I considered this move weird and hoped to be able to kill, but in the end I got only gote seki. Any better way how to attack?]

(;B[bq]
(;W[bp]
(;B[cr];W[ds]
(;B[cq]
(;W[dq]
(;B[bs];W[ar]
(;B[ao]C[In game, I made mistake, w could have lived like in the variations]

(;W[aq]C[But she made a mistake as well,];B[br]TR[fa][ka][la]
[ma][eb][kb][lb][mb][lc][rd][sd][se][rf][sf][aj][bj][ak][bk]
[al][bl][am][bm][cm][go][io][qq][rq][sq][pr][qr][rr][sr][ps]
[qs][rs][ss]SQ[ad][bd][ae][be][ce][de][ee][sk][sl][is]LB[lk:A]
[kf:B][ph:C]C[So it again became seki. At this point, she resigned. I am not sure that was necessary -- I seem to be a bit ahead on territory, but I stll have some weaknesses (j17) and there are quite a few big moves (she might be able to get enough territory in the center), so I don't think the game is already decided.

NM: I did not find a way to kill, there may be a way as it is not easy to read.

NM: There are entry points into White Moyo, so it is not big. Black is ahead in territoy.
B46 W24 + 10 to 15 points moyo + komi.
So black ahead by at least 5 points.
Yes perhaps too early to resign.
Black has some big endgame plays, M2, S6, B18, so it looks good for black.]
