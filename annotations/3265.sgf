C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and won, but I not satified with this play as I think I won because White made too many mistakes - I think he could win here. That is why I submit this game for review.
Any comments you come up with are welcome!

Thanks, Avi];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]

;B[pl];W[cf]C[I would like to get your comment on the sequence so far. I am not sure Black should be satisfied: Suppose both dragons (M17 and O17) live, White's potential on the left seems to me bigger than Black's on the right. What do you say?

This position seems reasonable for both players. I think it's easier to invade the W area than the B, so although it looks a little bigger the value is about the same.]
;B[nm]C[Trying to increase Black's territory as long as pressure can still be applied on White

I think O7 is the right move, but maybe not for the same reasons as you. I would like to play J12 here to enter the W area, but it seems slack - so I think of O7 as an inducing move, forcing W to move to the left and then J12 flows naturally.]

(;B[ig];W[kn];B[he]C[I am not so sure about this move - it may be an overplan - see later.

yes, this is an overplay by B];W[kf];B[lf];W[jh];B[jg];W[kg]
;B[kh];W[ie]C[Here I felt a bit risky as Black. Trying to capture K12 in a ladder does not work, and simply J11 does not work either because White will atari L12 and escape. so...]
;B[mh]C[I peeped first here to set up a ko on L12.];W[nh];B[ii]

(;W[lm]C[I think White should at least try the ko. In my view M7 was not an urgent move and Black could tenuki and secure M17. Please comment.

M7 is in fact an urgent move. It's not obvious that W can fight well without covering the cut here (although I think he can). He chose the simple and clear variation and it's not unfavourable for him, but maybe he could gain something more by risking more.]
;B[ji];W[hf]C[White tries to take profit on the top left, so I though this was the last opportunity to invade there and reduce.]
;B[fe];W[gf];B[cc]
(;W[ge]C[this W move is very bad.];B[dc];W[eb]C[... and this move is even worse, trying to kill something which cannot be killed always leads to disaster.]
;B[ec];W[fb];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[cg];B[db];W[cn]
C[I think Black has a problem in this position, again because White is dominant in the bottom left part of the borad. Am I reading the situation well?

W needs about 25-30pt from his framework in the lower left to be even with B - I think that's about the amount he can get so the game seems even to me.]
;B[ei]C[too deep.];W[gi];B[gj];W[hh]
(;B[ih]C[I think you are saving some pretty unimportant stones here - although you get two secure eyes in the process, losing E11 is too much.]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[fi];B[fk];W[ek];B[hi]C[this move is a bit slow since the upper B stones are more or less alive already you can consider to play E8 hane and fight with W.]
;W[el];B[gn]C[Is this the right move, in view of White's next move?

locally, yes - but maybe you would like to play D3 instead.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[md];B[ld];W[qc]C[I was not surprised to see White invading here - I selected to separate the invading group from the O17 group, which is still not fully secure. Is this correct?

yes];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nb];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[oc];B[mc];W[sd]C[The main benefit Black achieved here is that M17 has almost secured the second eye, and sente.]
;B[og]C[Protecting aginst the bad aji on R13 in sente.

you're not 100% protected even after this move.];W[of];B[mp]
;W[im]C[White is rushing to secure his group - but in my view he should have playd L4 instead. This will serve to reduce Black area, and also increase his chances to secure his group - I was happy to see this move...

I think he's aiming at G7 cut, but L4 makes it small. I agree with you, L4 is a better point.]
;B[kp];W[io]C[At this point I thought White is leading, and Black should start pishing...

I invested a few moves to reduce White territory on the top.]
;B[fc];W[gc];B[gb];W[hb];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[fd];W[if]
C[I think White could tenuki.

yes, this W move is almost like playing pass.];B[iq];W[gm]C[White is thinking all the time about securing his group. If this is his concern, I would play H4 if I were him and at least apply some pressure on Black.

somehow he thinks he can attack the big black group if he separates it from the rest, but it's just wrong.]

;B[cp]C[Suddenly it is Black who captures the bottom left corner. I think White could at least play C4 before Black played there and win many points.

yes, you are right - now the game is about even again.];W[fp]
C[... of course W should not play these moves as they waste ko threats and increase your territory]

;B[em];W[fm];B[en]C[I felt ahead here, so I played thick and connected instead of playing the ko.

this move is almost like playing pass, since white has only three liberties and you have many more on both sides. if you play P3, there is no way W can catch up.]
;W[kj]C[White is trying now to kill the Black dragon. I was surprised to see that my group there was not fully secure yet...]
;B[ki];W[oa]C[I thought first White's L18 and after Black's M18 White's N19 would be a problem for Black - but then I saw that Black's N19 makes miai of capturing M19 or make an eye on P19.]

;B[op];W[nr]C[With this invasion, Blacks lead was reduced to a minimum

yes];B[eg]C[I decided to take a chance and invade. It seems to me that if White plays correctly, this invasion would fail.

this kind of thinking is very dangerous. you should never rely on your opponent's mistake unless you are very desperate and you just said yourself that you believe the game is close with maybe a small advantage for B...]

yes, he would win the capturing race and probably the game.]
