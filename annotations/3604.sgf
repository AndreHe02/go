C[D:  Hi!  Thanks in advance for taking a look at my game.

I played black this game.  White's fuseki was non-traditional, and I responded too conventionally.  Hence, I feel like I was behind from the end of the fuseki.  I also had some difficulty deciding when to consolidate versus when to reduce; could you take a hard look at the fuseki and early mid-game?

Thank you!];B[pd];W[jd];B[dp]C[D:  I'm a little confused, so I play to build up influence on the opposite side of the board.

B: ANY corner is good in response to k16. Your move is fine (though I think I'd play in the top left to sort of pincer k16).]
;W[jp]C[B: I would be happy as Black, that White is giving me corners.]
;B[ed]C[D:  My goal here was to lessen the influence of the K16 stone.  In retrospect, I feel like I should have played the 5-3 move (E17).  What do you think the proper corner move is here?

B: k16 is light, with too much space on every side to be able to put pressure on. Now White can (perhaps now, perhaps later) play c16, and get the corner while you get outside influence - but your influence will be (at least partially) neutralised by k16.

D:  Is a non-corner move (like tengen, perhaps) a better option?

B: Honestly, I think playing tengen would be playing into your opponents hands. It seems to me that it would not achieve much - certainly not making territory or putting pressure on the two White stones.]
;W[jj]C[B: Again, I would be happy to take the last corner.]
;B[qp]C[D:  Again, in retrospect, I feel like I played the wrong move; P3 or Q3 seem better.  Is this 3-4 facing the wrong way?

B: Yes. this 3-4 is facing the wrong way. Better to face q16. But with three White stones in the middle like that, you can't expect a great framework on the right side (nor anywhere, for that matter), so 4-4 might be better.]
;W[qf]C[B: Your first four moves were easy - taking the corners. That was the area where conventional play allowed you to take the lead. Now it gets difficult. You are ahead, I would say, but your lead is only slight. Perhaps with perfect play it might be 10 or 15 points, which is not much, especially when compare to the mistaked that you will both certainly make in such an unconventional game as this one.

But regardless of all that, you should be happy to be put in this position, to test your knowledge of the truths of go outside of the conventional flow of a game, and even I should be happy to be reviewing it, to be challenged to make sense of it and explain it.

With the first seven moves, White set the stage. With White 8, at r14, the game starts. I do not know how Black should respond. I will look at some options. You pincered, and my only thought right now on what that means is that you are not supporting q16, and q16 is a stone that will need support. But White's stones in the middle mean that White can expect to gain some advantage in this area whatever happens. In fact, as all four of the corners play out, you should expect to see White come out better than normal, purely because White has such influence in the middle.]

(;B[qh]C[D:  A pincer of some sort seems right, but the one space low pincer gave white a lot of influence.  Would you pincer?  Would you play a more distant one?

B: You must ask the question "Why pincer?". Normally it is to put pressure on White, or to push White into the corner and take influence. But here when White jumps out you lose all hope of attacking him because of his stones in the middle, and your two stones are split apart.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[pi];B[qe];W[rf];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[ql];W[pg]C[B: I honeslty think White got more on the outside than you got in the corner and on the side. White has weaknesses to aim at on both sides. What if White r6, for example?]
;B[cd]C[B: I'd be scared for those stones in the top right. Surely White will attack them now...]
;W[dj]C[B: I think the attack would be better. Even if Black d10, White still has the stones in the centre to help reduce the moyo, nor does White d10 have a lot of territory potential.]
;B[dh]C[B: I'd prefer the other side. This way White is attacking your lower left corner with a three stones to one advantage.]
;W[dn]C[B: As White, I'd prefer c6 for balance, and a little more acces to the corner.]
;B[cn]C[D:  I chose not to play F4 because K4 restricts the extension, but I hated going for contact so early.  What option do you favor?

B: If you have fighting spirit, try d8. If not, I think c6 is okay. Yet White finds a good response...]

(;W[ep]C[B: E4 seems good to me. White's plan is clear. Obviously White c7 would leave White overconcentrated.

B: Perhaps e3 now, to make a big corner? Let's see what it would (might) look like...]

(;B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[en]
(;B[em]C[D:  D3 seems more important now; I played E7 to protect the weak point at C7.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cl];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[cp]C[B: Painful! Yuck. (and b5 would be better, not making an empty triangle, and not leaving an endgame play...)]

(;W[qc]C[B: Did this move make you regret d12? It should have.]
;B[pc]C[B: Yes, I think you need to be defensive here.];W[qd]
;B[qb];W[re];B[pe];W[op]C[B: White can still atack later, with s18. Especially if he gets a move around m17 first. But p4 is also a wonderful move. White must have felt very happy when he played it.]

(;B[oq]C[B: This leads to a good White position. What other options were there? Perhaps n4? After all, it seems you will need to get into the moyo somehow.]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[np]C[B: So good!]
(;B[pn]C[B: Thin. Let's see...]
(;W[rb]C[B: I think this is the wrong side. The corner is not so big. It is not needed for White to make life.]
;B[lc];W[le]
(;B[gm]C[D:  At this point, I feel like I'm behind.  I have some stable territory, but white's bottom and top center are huge.

B: I feel the same. I'll look at some other options...

B: No, this is good, but for a reason I think you didn't see - it builds up to an attack on d10. If you can capture that on a large scale, it will turn the game.]
;W[fj]C[B: He sees it. But even now, you can attack. H10, capping, splitting, and pushing him towards your strength. Do it!]

(;B[hc]C[B: It makes territory, but that is not enough. You need something more, or something bigger.]
;W[eh]C[B: He feels his weakness.];B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[jb];B[nf]
C[D:  I really wanted a way into the center from the top; was it worth ignoring K18 to get one?]

;B[kg]C[B: What if White n14 now?]
(;W[lh];B[lg];W[nb];B[ob]C[D:  This was a reflex, but now that I review, I realize M18 is fine.]
;W[lb];B[nc];W[mb];B[oe];W[me];B[ne];W[pa]
(;B[li]C[B: I'd take r19 first, I think.];W[jh]C[B: White is so smart, making territory while attacking.]
;B[kh];W[mk]C[B: And again. He can't be far from being 1 dan, because he has cured himself of "kyu disease" (the desire to kill groups).]
;B[mi];W[pb]C[B: There was a time when White probably would have answered r19. Let's look at if he hadn't...]
;B[oa];W[qa];B[oc];W[nm]
(;B[im]C[D:  I definitely ignored the bottom too long; when would it have been a better time to disrupt the bottom moyo?  Also, what moves have more potential than this one space jump?

B: I can't say what is better. Nothing further away seems to stay connected. But I don't know why you say you waited too long - you got to play here before White, no?]

B: When White played o4, the bottom was gone for you.

B: This was an interesting game. In my (humble) opinion, White played very well, and it was only because of his unconventional opening, disregarding territory, that he was not further ahead at the end.

B: I think the major lesson you should learn from this game is to pay attention to the stones that are around. The one space pincer at the beginning of the game was a strategic mistake, because you neglected the White's influence.

B: C16, taking the top left, again ignored that the top right was weak and surrounded.

B: D12 ignored the fact that d4 had no support and a White stones looking at it from k4.

B: P3, in a sense, ignore the great White moyo building to the left (where you see now that White got most of his points).

B: H17 ignored all the friendly Black strength around the two White stones to the left, neglecting an opportunity for attack to take a not very big purely territorial point.

B: That's pretty much all I have to say. If you have any questions, or if you need clarification on anything, or if I missed anything out, or if you see any errors in my reading, drop me an e-mail at ben.bildstein@gmail.com.]
