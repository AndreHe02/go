AB[dp][pd]C[Dear Reviewer,

I lost this game by a lot, mostly because I had no consistent strategy. I am black, playing against a stronger player with a handicap. In general I'm not good in such games. The opponent built many separate groups and all survived, because I wasn't consistently attacking. So my questions will relate on how to better attack, and also protect my moyo. Thanks!

Jernej

Dear Jernej,

I am Amygdala and I will henceforth mark my comments with "A:", yours with "J:".
I hope that I can help. If I do not answer all your questions sufficiently, discussion and further questions are welcome.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[lp];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]C[J:
I was not sure here what to play. Was Q5 OK?

A:
Yes it was. It is joseki.];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[A:
So this is a little lenient.];W[pj]C[A:
Still, I like the variation better.]
(;B[ql];W[qk];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp]C[A:
The white group is the "L+2 group" (see James Davies' "Life and Death", chapter 23), which is alive as it stands.]
;B[rl];W[rk]C[J:
Seems like I only made white stronger with the last moves. What would be better alternative?

A:
Yes, you are right. See the previous comments.];B[cf];W[gd]
;B[di];W[fq];B[hq];W[cq];B[cp]C[J:
Would D3 be better, to build moyo on the bottom right?

A:
No. With c4 you go for the wider side, and that is correct.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[go];W[nr];B[os];W[kq]C[A:
From now on, anytime you wish you can install a ko in white's corner.]

(;B[lq]C[J:
Here I was struggling with a good response. Since black is so strong, is there a way to prevent white from living all together?

A:
For me it is also difficult to find a way to capture the white group right away. So in accordance with the proverbs "Do not touch weak stones" and "If you do not know where to play, play elsewhere" I would rather take a big point. See previous variation.]
;W[lr]
(;B[kr]C[A:
The wrong side. When white captures this stone, he gets a strong and flexible shape.]
;W[jr];B[mr];W[ks];B[mq]C[J:
Again, I gain little, and made white strong. Argh!];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[ck];B[cm]C[J:
Again, how to respond best to this white invasion?

A:
This hasami (pincer) looks natural. Good.];W[dm];B[cn];W[dj]

(;B[ei]C[A:
Bad, see variation.];W[ci]
(;B[ef];W[ch]C[A:
Good for white for the reasons given above: he has a base now.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[ip]C[A:
Bad: "Never play next to a cutting point". Rather, keep the opportunity for later.]
;W[jp];B[hr];W[io];B[bq];W[hp];B[gp];W[iq];B[gq];W[br]C[J:
Is there a way I could have killed the bottom left group? Bottom right seems to be alive.

A:
The best you can get in the right corner is a ko, as illustrated previously. If white plays correctly, you cannot kill the bottom left group. But he does not!]

(;B[bp]
(;W[en]
(;B[eo]C[A:
Unnecessary. After the hane of death you will win any running battle.]
;W[ar]C[A:
Now white is definitely alive after all.];B[bl];W[cl]
(;B[ph]C[J:
I wanted to do R12, but got scared, and tried this instead. Which didn't bring any profit at all.

A:
This move only strengthens the white group. Again, rather take a large point elsewhere.]
;W[qh]
(;B[pg];W[qg];B[jd]C[A:
Better deep and one farther to the left.];W[jj]
(;B[jh]C[A:
At most times, the center is least important.];W[mf];B[pf];W[kf]
;B[ld];W[if]CR[jh][lh]C[J:
In the end I lost the game mostly due to the center, where white got most of the points. Maybe playing M12 or around, to prevent white from building anything in the center would work here?

A:
As you did, I would also prefer the other direction to offer help to the weak group to the left, but take the straight one point jump.]

(;B[hi];W[kh]
(;B[ol]C[A:
From now on, the endgame gets a little erratic. Both sides often take small points instead of the big ones. I am not an endgame expert myself, but tried to find a better order of moves for the first stage of it... Once again: take points at the edge rather than in the center.]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[ff];B[bd];W[cc];B[gk];W[fk];B[cg];W[fh]
(;B[fi]C[A:
Bad shape, an empty triangle.];W[jl];B[gl]C[J:
I was afraid for the two left groups, and wanted to have a chance to connect them. I guess they were safe, and I should have played M8.

A:
The lower left black group is alive, the upper one is still weak. The idea to connect both groups is not bad.]
;W[mm];B[ll]C[J:
This was bad response, but I just couldn't accept a totally defensive move at O6 or around.

A:
I do not think that it was so bad. It will not capture the white stone but creates potential for later.]
;W[lm]
(;B[nn]C[A:
This is not consequent. Stick to your ideas and do not change the direction midways! See variation.]

Any way to kill the R17 group?

I do not think so.]

In summary, your way of playing has nice potential! Here are some hints for further improvement:

1.
Learn proverbs! They can be quite helpful. I can recommend "Proverbs", Yutopian Enterprises.

2.
Study the basic shapes of life and death, especially corner problems. Repeat them over and over.

3.
Prefer points at the edge to points in the center.

4.
Never be afraid. Know that you still have to study, but while playing, trust in yourself. If you cannot read out the danger, do not protect against it. Attack instead.

Thank you for letting me review your game!])
