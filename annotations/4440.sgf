AB[pd][dp]C[Andrew, my name is Frank, I will be reviewing your game.  My comments and variations are scattered throughout.  I think the game became difficult early on because of a few early mistakes.  From then, it was basically uphill.  In terms of endgame, I'm not sure if there is much to be said.  You did a pretty good job of keeping sente and B made some big mistakes.  The biggest thing though is just maintaining focus.

I hope this review helps.



I'm basically looking to get a feell for what mistakes I made throught out.  The game ended up very very close, but it felt that I was catching up for the whole game.  the a few mistakes in the end game cost me 1 or 2 points, which made it a black win by 1.  I would like to know how I might have gotten ahead a bit faster, and some of the places I gave up initiative early.

I've pointed out some of the mistakes I'm awareof throughout.

I'm also particularly interested in whether my end game choices, and move orders could have been improved.]

If you kakari Q4, you can still aim for the 3-3 point at R17 later on..

I think this was a mistake.  L14 is obviously, in retrospect, needed to prevent scores of aji around k18.]
