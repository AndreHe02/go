C[Flux: hello!
Tuk : hello! Thanks for reviewing this game...

Thanks for giving me a chance to review this game - it was interesting. the game wasn't decided until the final 3 or 4 moves - B missed one last chance to win...

Both W and B seem quite good at developing moyos - big areas of potential territory, but less good at reducing or invading your opponent's moyo. It's very rare to see strong players play a game with such little fighting or invading. 

Usually weaker players are too aggressive (especially me ;-) but here I think you should probably be a bit more aggressive. Remember it's important to choose when to play passively and when to be aggressive.

I have indicated where i would play in some situations and left quite a lot of potential variations in the file, but remember they're only ideas - only pros can talk with real authority]

LB[cn:A];B[fn]LB[fm:A]TR[jp][jq]C[Jumping as far as A is more usual. A joseki move at one of the triangles would be fine also]
;W[po]LB[mp:A]C[A might be an alternative]
(;B[np]C[Tuk: I think it's my first mistake here... is P5 better?

yes i think so - O4 is a defensive move]
(;W[op];B[oq]C[Flux: Is this good for white, because the shape is bad...
the idea was to make black crawls.

Usually this exchange is good for black,];W[no];B[mp]C[pushing black from behind this way is generally bad for white]
;W[mo];B[lp]C[this is good for black];W[pj]C[Flux: L6 and Q10 are miai?

L6 is not so big, I think playing in the corner is very large though]

(;B[kn]C[Tuk: is this too early ?

Yes I think so- I'd play R5. It does provide a way for B to reduce white on the right though]
;W[ce]C[Flux: I lost the sente here but i though it was good...
was it really worth it?

(;W[og]C[L6 makes it easy to invade white's right so it might be bad to play 28, R15 is more usual]
;B[qe]
(;W[qg]C[Flux: O14 better?

I'd play S14. If B answers then take sente, if not, then you can reduce the corner later. This is slow]
;B[nc]C[Odd move- you can play m16 or n15 to take more territory, even these are slow i think.]
;W[nf];B[gc];W[od]C[This sequence doesn't do much damage to B and removes the aji around N17, say.]
;B[oc];W[ne];B[nd];W[oe]
(;B[pe]C[These two stones are not important - sente is bigger]
;W[mh]
(;B[re]C[Also a bit slow. 
White has big moves on the right and the left - D10 and possibly N8 or so. This move secures the corner (see variation) but lets white take the initiative.]

(;W[dm]C[Good - taking territory, but i would play at D10, I think, to play on a grander scale]
;B[me]TR[ci][cj][ml][nl][mm][nm][qo]C[I think that the top is less urgent than the left or the right. I would play on one of the triangles]
;W[mf];B[le]
(;W[lf]
(;B[ke]C[Usually this sort of pushing helps B more than W but here B has taken about 6 points on top, but lost Sente. There must be more important places than this.]
;W[lm]C[Very large - bad news for black];B[sh];W[sg];B[rg];W[rh]
;B[sf];W[ri];B[si];W[sj];B[sg];W[rj]C[This is a big endgame sequnce]

(;B[dg]TR[kj][lj][qo]C[Tuk: I didn't know what to do on the west of the board although there was space...
The result was bad i think cause I lost this stone later.

This is the right idea but not enough - I would invade a bit deeper. .]
;W[ci]C[Very good -this move makes D13 look like it's in the wrong place by taking away B's room to make a base on the left]
;B[ff];W[fd];B[gd]C[Things get complicated here. B needs to be careful because white might take control of the center with moves such as K13. However, B cannot give up the left as easily as you do...]
;W[ef];B[fe]C[The side is bigger than the center - E13 i think is better]

(;W[eg];B[kf]C[I think jumping to L12 is more effective.];W[fg]

(;B[jl]C[This move encourages W to secure more territory, how about L10 or M10]
;W[km];B[jm];W[lk]C[Flux: L7, K7 exchange reinforce black but makes my stones stronger was I wrong?

playing simply at m9 without l7/k7 leaves more potential to reduce]
;B[gg];W[fl]C[good spot for both sides];B[ee];W[de];B[qo]C[About 50 moves too late i think ;-)]

(;W[fm]C[Flux: Is this too nice for black... G7 better? (variation)

no real difference];B[gm];W[fk];B[en];W[dn]C[W is clearly ahead now. The only danger is the middle...]
