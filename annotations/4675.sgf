C[I know that there was only 15 minutes per person, but I was never short on time.  I didn't play all the way through, so I thought about every move.

I thought this game was going really well for me, but I just started falling apart in the middle, so I would like to know what you think about my opening.

In particular, I have a question about how to handle J15 (move 42), because I obviously had no idea.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

My name is Johanna Tuominen I'm EGF 2 kyu from Finland.
Hope my comments help, and enjoy the game of Go!];B[pd];W[pp]

[do:B]C[JT: Yes, nice direction of play. Both A and B are good moves for black.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[do];W[fp];B[ck]LB[dk:A]TR[co][do]C[Where should I go here?  Is D10 better?
JT: I would say that D10 is too far away from your marked stones. C9 or D9 are better. I would have played the mmove in A because it takes more influence to the center, but both are ok.]
;W[cd]C[I didn't really know what to do about this, but I was happy with the result.  How should I have played?

JT: The C15 move is simple, good answer. Another possibility is to play C17. But then white goes to th left side, which in this situation is not good.]
;B[ce];W[cc];B[dc];W[be];B[cf];W[cb];B[db];W[nd];B[kd]C[Is this pincer ok?  Which should I use instead, if it's not?

(;B[bf];W[ad]C[Do I need to add another move on the top here, because his wall is facing mine + my stone?

JT: Well it is safer that way. I probably would play on the top. Of course if you find a bigger move, and you are ready to maybe sacrifice a bit then no.]

(;B[hd]C[Is J17 better? Or did I just mess up the continuation?

JT: Yes the J17 would be better.];W[id]C[JT: Instead of the hane in J17, I would just to H17.]

(;B[ic];W[jc]C[Maybe I should just sacrifice those stones, too, but that seems too big for him, considering it seems like I'm a bit behind.]
