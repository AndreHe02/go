(preceded by "NM").];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd]C[This is what I usually play, hoping to get K10 next and after it - D10 or Q10 - a big moyo.



NM: Fair enough];W[jj];B[jp]C[NM: "Don't break symmetry"

:-). More seriously, this

is fine because a move around F3 and one around )3 are miai.]
;W[hp];B[nq]C[NM: Good];W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[kp];W[jq];B[lo]
C[NM: OK. You could be more agressive and playu J3

directly. At least it's a

useful kikashi.];W[mp];B[mq]C[NM: O4 also possible; the idea is not much different.]
;W[ip];B[no]C[NM: the right move, but don't fool yourself - the W stones are not dead. (Consider L5 followed by N5)]
;W[dj];B[qn]C[Should I waste the move and kill?



NM: I think I would have played somewhere round R10, or else D7; but certainly killing is possible - the best move to kill is probably K7 (see variation a little further on for why that works). The problem with this move is that W can play so as to devalue it, e.g. by playing Q8.]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[mo]
(;B[kn]C[NM: I think I would play the variation and sacrifice 3 stones.]
;W[mn];B[np];W[qq];B[po];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp]
(;B[ln]C[NM: The 4 W stones are well worth killing now; I think N7 does the trick. See variation.]

;W[oj];B[pl];W[ol];B[mj];W[lk];B[kj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[ph]
C[NM: Up to now the attack has gone well, but this move is not good. I think you must reinforce your weak O3 group with something like R10. This doesn't help either that group or your Q10 stone.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[qj];B[qk]C[NM: I don't understand what you're trying to do.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[qh];B[rl];W[pm];B[pn];W[qm];B[rm];W[sj];B[nn]
;W[nm];B[pr];W[qr];B[pq];W[rr];B[op]C[I had a feeling my bottom right group was not unconditionally alive. But I took the risk (my opponent thought it is).

NM: looks to me as if you can make two eyes at the bottom. See variation.]

(;W[pg];B[cq]C[NM: This is quite good, but I think I would make a probing move at D7 first, to see how W responds, given that K10 and D10 are both isolated and weak. But there's nothing wrong with invading now.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[fq];B[gm]C[NM: This is a big reduction, but that's all. I think a move like C12 or R15 is bigger.]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[hn];W[gn];B[go];W[fn];B[ho]
;W[il];B[gq];W[gp];B[fp];W[gr];B[fo];W[en];B[ci]C[NM: Not good. C12, D12 or C13 would be better. Or if you want to be agressive G10.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[df];B[cj]C[NM: Once you play at D13 you have to cut at C14, even if it means abandoning C11.]
;W[dh];B[bl];W[bm];B[am];W[cl];B[bk];W[ck];B[di];W[ej];B[ei]
;W[eg];B[fi]C[NM: OK, you've got out and you've separated W; but one group is absolutely alive and the other has a pon-nuki; and your D16 stones is greatly weakened. Not a great result for B.]
;W[fj];B[cd];W[bh];B[fd]C[NM: I think if you're going to play on the side it should be at G17. But I would play G11, which keeps a bit of pressure on the pon-nuki.]
;W[gi];B[hd]C[NM: NO! If you want simply to make territory, N17 is clearly bigger.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[al];B[ak];W[nd]C[How should I deal with this invasion? I think I had big losses here.



NM: What you did wasn't bad. You clearly can't kill it. Another possibility would be simply R14 and leave W the problem of how to develop the stone. Neither of you is going to make much territory here anyway.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb]C[NM: I would play R14 now, which is clearly bigger.]
;W[rd];B[md];W[ld]C[NM: If you're going to play N16 you must follow up with N15. As it is you give him a pon-nuki for little benefit to yourself.]
