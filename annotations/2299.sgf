C[Xris: Hi, this game was absolutely fatal for me and I would like to know why. I added comments and prefixed them with "Xris:".

S> Hello, this is Scartol (aka Eric Piotrowski). I'm 6k on KGS right now, but I don't get to play there as much as I'd like so I have a (?)

S> You hit the nail right on the head when you acknowledged that you play too closely. When you have an advantage (such as a large wall around the middle), but especially when trying to kill: Back off. Cut off escape routes and eye space, and be sure to avoid capture. Keep your distance and you'll be much more deadly.

S>As I'm sure you've noticed, my comments will be preceded by the S> symbol.]
;B[qp];W[dc];B[pc];W[dq]C[S> An unusual opening for a 20k game, but there's nothing wrong with it. All I will say is that these moves have a very complex relationship to each other (or at least they should). To make things simpler, you might want to try starting with less complicated opening moves like the 4-4 or 3-3. Once you master the most common variations for those, it's easier to move along to others. Just an idea.]
;B[nq]C[S> This is wide for black. Not necessarily bad, but something to notice for later perhaps.]
;W[pe];B[qg];W[nd]C[S> Not bad, so long as you realize that you're going for outside influence.]
;B[nc];W[pg]LB[mc:A][md:B]C[S> It's usually bad to ignore a contact play this early in the game. Either A or B is more appropriate here.]
;B[qh];W[pj]LB[ph:A]C[S> Notice that you're leaving a long string of single stones lying around. Black will certainly try to exploit this weakness. When black pushes at R12, follow him at A.]
;B[qj];W[pi]LB[qk:A]C[S> A is better. As much as possible, keep your opponent divided. (Makes it easier to conquer!)]
;B[qk];W[mc];B[od];W[ne];B[oe];W[of]LB[nf:A]C[S> The last few white moves bother me, but I can't decide what would be better. For now, notice that A is a dangerous cutting point for white.]
;B[pd];W[qe];B[qd];W[re]C[S> Good -- cutting into his framework, keeping him divided!]
;B[rd];W[qi]LB[de:C][ph:A][do:B]C[S> This is very small. Black can easily defend, and the defect at A remains for white. Indeed, after the exchange, A is much more dangerous than it was before. Just because a move is sente doesn't mean it's always good.
--
S> Now is a great time to play B. (Can you figure out why B is better than C right now?)]
;B[ri];W[nb];B[ob];W[oc]LB[dj:B][do:A]C[S> It's too early for a ko. If black won't seal the atari up, just leave it. You don't want to get caught up in a fight right now. Either A or B is better.]
;B[pa];W[nc]C[S> It's one stone -- let it go. You must learn to sacrifice stones unless they serve some higher purpose.]
;B[qb];W[jd]LB[dj:B][do:A]C[S> Good, but this is slow. Either A or B works on a much larger scale, and will help more when the inevitable black invasion comes.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[rh];W[jq]C[Xris: Up until now I thought my massive outside influnece would get my a win easily but....]
;B[fq]
(;W[fp]C[S> Too close. See variation.];B[gp];W[gq]LB[ep:A]TR[jq]
C[S> You do NOT want to start complicated fighting here. When the enemy moves into your lair, keep things simple and let HIM scramble to survive. Just retreat to A and keep an eye on the marked stone.]
;B[ep]
(;W[fo]C[S> This move says: "I'm trying to save everything. I don't have to give up anything," which is of course wrong. Let that one stone go. Either of the variation moves is better.]
;B[eq];W[dp];B[eo];W[fn]C[S> Let these go! Protect the corner while you still have it.]
;B[do];W[co]C[S> Otherwise, the enemy will stretch you out and capture something.]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]
(;W[br]C[S> Still too early for this. You must extend once more. See variation on how to live.]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[Xris: Here I lost the corner because I simply overlooked the atari. He was tricking me int quick play :-P. But still, this is maybe worth 30 pts and I still had a good point advantage.
--
S> Black has captured the corner not because of the missed atari, but because of white trying to save everything. White is still very strong on the top, but: (a) black now has a very powerful position in the bottom left corner, like a snake coiled up in a basket; (b) the capture has shredded the position of the other white stones along the bottom; and (c) the capture is a painful psychological blow against white (at least it would be for me). 
--
S> Thus we can see how one little move (not extending a second time at B3) has probably cost white the game. I don't wish to be harsh, but it's important to emphasize the urgency of caution when fighting on the goban.]
;B[cp];W[cf]LB[di:A]C[S> This is a little timid. Black is threatening to strike up there, so you need some support below to prepare. I suggest A.]
;B[bn];W[dm]C[S> This doesn't do much. If you're going to cut, cut. The proverb says: "Never peep at a cutting point."]
;B[dn];W[cj];B[hq]LB[dh:A][ej:B]C[S> This is a wasted move by black -- hopefully you had written that stone off anyway. Seize the initiative and play a big move like A or B.]
;W[gr]C[S> By all means, do not try to save a lost stone.];B[hr]
;W[hp];B[gs];W[fr];B[fs];W[go];B[er];W[gp]C[S> All this has done is give white a dense, clumsy shape on the bottom. Meanwhile, the upper framework (where black is sure to head soon) is flimsy and under-fortified.]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[kr]LB[dh:C][ej:B][kq:A]C[Xris: And again I had a very strong outside wall.
--
S> If a strong wall is what you want, then you should play solidly at A. Still, I suggest making the top area stronger with B or C.]
;B[fc]LB[hc:A][ee:B]C[S> Here it comes. Rule #1: Don't panic. If you want quick territory. pincer at A. If you want to protect the left, jump out to B.]
;W[fd]C[S> When you attach, you help your opponent get stronger -- but it sounds like you know this already. As the proverb says: "Only after the first 50 blows will you see the punch. Only after the first 100 will you duck."]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[he];B[hc];W[jc]LB[ed:A][dh:B]
[ej:C]C[S> Never mind about the top -- you've given it up to keep black out of your middle. Now protect the middle with A, B, or C.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[ec];W[ed];B[db];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc]C[S> Good!]
;B[dh]LB[ej:A]C[Xris: From this point onwards it was clear that I lost as I failed to kill b97. How could I have prevented this?
--
S> Again, don't panic. You do need to kill this in order to remain in the game. 
--
S> Step one: Close off escape routes. This is more or less taken care of. Black might still flee to the strong bottom left corner, or maybe the bottom right -- but that will be a last resort.
--
S> Step two: Do not let black capture anything. Capturing a stone is the easiest way (often) to make an eye in a tight spot. Back off and keep the pressure on from a distance.
--
S> Step three: Attack eye space. Look at it from black's point of view: If you wanted to make eyes, where would you strike?
--
S> In this instance, the one-space jump (ikken-tobi) is probably best. A is a nice solid multipurpose move.]
;W[ch]C[S> Too close. Back off.];B[di];W[dj]LB[ci:A]C[S> Too risky. Connect at A. The more black can stretch you out, the easier it will be to make eyes.]
;B[ej];W[ei]C[s> Too soon to cut. You don't want to settle for a few stones -- you want all of them. You need all of them! Cutting too early gives the enemy forcing moves.]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[ci];W[bi]C[S> Too close. Extending to A is safer, although then black gets a good shot at connecting to the bottom group.]
;B[bh];W[bj];B[cg]LB[bf:A]TR[bg][dg]C[S> Black now has one eye so long as He eventually occupies both of the marked points. A provides a good shot at making a second eye.]
;W[df];B[bf];W[be]LB[ag:A][dg:B]C[S> If black plays at A, he makes an eye. (Of course black can falsify the other eye by playing at B.)]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[gh];W[ff]TR[bi][ei][fi][gi][bj][cj][dj]C[S> Never mind about this. You cannot allow black to capture the marked stones. Protect them!]
;B[hi];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[hg];W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[ih];W[if]
;B[gf]LB[ag:C][dg:B][hh:A]C[S> Black now has two eyes -- A is certain to become an eye (so long as black plays his cards right). B and C are miai for the second eye. Because the black group can live, white should resign.]

;W[mh];B[ni];W[pf];B[mi];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji]C[Xris: Now I shut him off completely and I saw the "glimpse" of victory.
--
S> No. If black keeps up, he's got two eyes. White here is just hoping for a mistake by black.]
;B[ii];W[jh];B[jg];W[kh];B[kg];W[lh];B[ig];W[hf];B[li];W[mf]
;B[gg]LB[ag:C][dg:B][hh:A]C[S> A is obviously an eye now -- with no hope for a ko fight -- and B and C are still miai for life.]
;W[af]C[S> A good move -- black made his fatal error. Now let's see if it bears fruit.]
;B[kk]C[Xris: Now I only needed to smuggle in a ladderbreaker in order to kill the large group, but ... (again a but :-( )
--
S> A vain hope for a game like this, and a tad disrespectful. It's better to reisgn with dignity before exhausting every last chance to make your opponent stumble blindly.
--
S> I hope these comments help. You've got a good sense of whole-board play; keep practicing and have fun! If you see me on KGS, feel free to ask for a game -- I always enjoy teaching others.

S> End of comments.];W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[kl]C[Xris: b171 destroyed my hopes and I was only hoping that he will make the mistake of going into a ladder instead of a net.]
;W[on];B[oo];W[pn];B[qn];W[lj];B[mk]C[Xris: Which he didnt, and since I cannot win the semai I resigned four moves later.]
;W[bg];B[ah];W[dg];B[ch];W[ag];B[mj]C[Xris has resigned the game.

Xris: Was there a way to turn the tide? And why did I fail to kill the group? My guess would be not enough distance between his and my stones.


Thank you very much for reviewing the game. I hope you also include comments on bad moves in general (and maybe good ones if you can find any ;-). Also my style of play definitely needs improvement so ALL comments, really are appreciated very much.
