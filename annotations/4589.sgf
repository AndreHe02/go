AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi Michael,

It's Jenson here. Nice to see you here. So this is a match with handi, all right I'll try to give you the best review, but don't expect expert review from me, as I don't think I'm fit to be called expert.

Well. let's the review begins.];W[nc]C[Masuran [20k\]: Hello :)
chabochan [16k?\]: hi

Well, maybe I should not comment on the opening move, as it's the freedom of Go players to choose where they want to place their stones. Normally, we choose to play at these 2 different spots to counter-attack white's corner approach. Please see the variations for details]
N[Various variations are available]
(;B[ob]C[This is quite rare as I seldom see players playing this move. But it's a good try to secure your corner too.]
;W[qf];B[oc];W[nd];B[nb]MA[qe]C[Well, Black's move 6 is not neccessary for the moment, the important move is to block white to further extend from it's Move 3. 

Black should try to play around R15, to prevent White from breaking Black's efforts in securing the corner.]
;W[rd]N[Better approach for Black]
(;B[qd]MA[qc]C[This move is not good enough as it still leave space for White to further  breaking down Black's wall.

Black should play at R17. Please see variation for this move.]
;W[rc];B[re]CR[nb][ob][oc][pd][qd]C[No way to escape if your group is not settled down yet.]
;W[qe];B[rf];W[rg];B[fc]TR[nc][nd]C[This is ok as it secure the corner and waiting for chance to extend further right and attack White lonely group on the right.]
;W[hc]C[White extends too much to the left, Black should take the chance to punish White.]
;B[ec]C[This is giving up the chance for attack and allowing White to settle down.]
;W[lc]TR[nc][nd]SQ[hc]C[Now White strengthen the tie between stones and connect the two lonesome stones on the right to the left.]
;B[mc];W[md];B[mb];W[jc];B[cn]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[No, extend further as your top left corner is secured by one more stone played.

Should try extend to C10 or D10.];W[qb]SQ[ob][nb][mb][mc][oc]
[pd][qd]C[Now White has turnover the situation, forcing black group to become unsettled.]
;B[qc];W[lb];B[rb];W[sb];B[ra];W[qa];B[sc]C[Well, wasted efforts as While can always capture your stones easily. Sorry to say that. Just to point out the mistake.]
;W[sa];B[ep]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[Again, this move is almost worthless, try to extend further to K3 or K4.

These moves helps Black spread out faster and building big Moyo, which might turn up as lucrative territories or base for launching attacks.]
;W[ch];B[mq];W[hq]C[White is too greedy.];B[hr];W[gr]N[Better move goes
here]
(;B[gq];W[ir];B[hs];W[is];B[gs]C[Again, the same mistake made.

See variation for better move at Node G2];W[fr];B[qo]C[Again, should try to extend further =)]
;W[qm]C[Now Black leaves too much space for white to extend and attack.]
;B[ql]C[Always avoid attach move, as this is very destructing.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[pl];W[nm];B[ol];W[po];B[oo];W[pn];B[rm]
;W[op];B[no];W[qp];B[pq];W[ro]C[Masuran [20k\]: Interesting shape :)

Now White has penetrate through Black's corner and trying to make White group making enough space to survive.]
;B[oq];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[sp];W[nn];B[mm];W[mo];B[np];W[mn]
;B[nl];W[lq];B[so];W[rn];B[lp];W[mp];B[lo]TR[mp][mo][mn][nn]
[nm][on][pn][pm][qm][po][qp][qq][rq][ro][rn]C[This move is useless as you can't kill that white group.

Play at N2 is a better move to survive on the board.];W[mr]
;B[nq];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[kq];B[km];W[ko]
;B[mm];W[kp];B[sn];W[qn];B[ck]C[White has take a great advantage from black.]
;W[cq]N[Variations for alternative moves]
(;B[cr]C[This move is not the correct reply to White's 3.3

Please see variation above.];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[br];B[fq]
;W[fs];B[cf];W[cc];B[cb]C[Again, this is not the correct move, please refer back to the variations shown before and study how to apply them here.]
;W[bb];B[bc]TR[eb][ea][da][fa][fb][gb][ga][ha]MA[db]C[I dont think now you are able to take back the corner that easily. Should try to play pull back at D18 to secure the other side and waiting for chance to counter-attack White's invasion.

And to extend to the board's centre.];W[bd];B[cd];W[ac];B[dc]
;W[bf];B[bc];W[be];B[ab]C[No, dont play here. Try to play somewhere here and keep this ko to allow you to threaten white.]
;W[cc];B[ad]C[This move is a wasted move. It won't help you at all.]
;W[bc];B[ba];W[db];B[ca];W[da]C[Masuran [20k\]: I can't belive I screwed that up :(

Until now, you not even give up the corner to white, but also help White to connect the corner to the white group on the right.]
;B[co]LB[bp:A]C[This is useless, I must say, play at B4 is much better]
;W[bp]C[Now white take the spot to further extend and prevent you from squeezing down the territory.]
;B[en]LB[ri:A][ho:B]C[Well, this move is not that important yet and it's still early for you to play there.

Try to play somewhere else like S11 or H5.];W[ho]C[Now White come out and destroy the dream for Black's big Moyo.]
;B[hp]C[Good try.];W[ip];B[gp];W[in];B[jo];W[jn];B[ri]C[Now you played here. That's the right move, not too late yet. Give yourself a round of applause.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[qh]
(;B[pg]LB[qj:A]C[No, this move is not important. Play at R10 instead.

See how it goes from the variation above.];W[qg];B[sg];W[rj]
;B[sh];W[se];B[sf]SQ[rf][re][sg][sh][rh][ri]C[Now your black group is dead.]
;W[si]C[Masuran [20k\]: Very good game
Masuran [20k\]: Thank you :)
chabochan [16k?\]: thx

Well in order to win this game, a lot of improvements need to be made.

I will roughly list out for your references.

1. Opening
2. Calculation
3. Ko and Ko Threat
4. Avoid unneccessary moves
5. Don't play too much attach approach.
6. Analyse and play on urgent place instead of playing at worthless points.
7. When need to extend further, avoid playing securing move.

I think that's all I can think for the moment by reviewing your game. 

Hopefully it helps you along the way.

Thanks.

Regards,
Jenson])
(;B[qj];W[rj]TR[rh][ri]C[If White want to capture two black stones, he will fail to do so as you are one move faster than him. Follow the next move.]
;B[sj]SQ[re][rf]C[Do you think now White 2 can escape? Forget about the black stones as they are dead stones.

Now matter how White play here, you will still be able to capture it and play at other places later on. Don't focus too much on one area if there isn't any urgent moves to be played there.]

(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]TR[pg][ph][pi][pk][pj][pl][pm][pn]
[po]C[This is one of the outcome that will allow black to secure the right. At the same time, black reserves the rights to fight with white for the top right hand corner.

This approach secure Black's right but also make sure the top right and bottom right have the chance to link up together to form a bigger territory, but allowing white to make enough living space on the top. It might seems to be fair play, but it's more advantageous for Black.]

(;B[lc];W[pb];B[qc];W[mb];B[lb];W[ne];B[pf]TR[kc][jd][id][hd]
[gd][fd][ed]C[This is also another possible move for Black and White, leave White four stones unsettles and strengthen the Black's right and allow black to extend towards the way that I show with triangle marks.]
