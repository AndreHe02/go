C[Dear reviewer,

This is a 60 minutes tournament game where I had White. During the whole game I felt like I was winning, though I was really 40 points behind. Then in the Byo Yomi phase I seemed to get in trouble for the first time, but actually the Byo Yomi helped me turn the game around.

The first 130 moves of the game could be reconstructed, for the rest, the order of moves is random.

I wonder what my strategic misconceptions were and if you could point them out to me.

Hi: I'm "gougou" from KGS. Feel free to msg me if you have further questions.

Several things you can work on:

1) first take care of weak groups, only then worry about the rest. 

2) Dont destroy taste by playing unnecessary sente moves.];B[dp]

;W[fo];B[ep];W[go]C[R: looks good for white... C10 is misplaced.]

R: seems fine to me... it makes good use of g4 stones.];B[np]
;W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[on];W[qp]C[R: this exchange hurts R7. Better go o4 directly and leave the potential cut for later!]

C[This is considered huge, but I guess protecting my bottom territory was urgent here.

R: locally , something like L4 might be better];B[lp];W[mq]
C[R: this move is not urgent.. How about p8 first? see variation.]

;B[kr]C[Not only did B steal my territory, he can also keep my groups separated and play against my left group.

R: You have to realize that without a stone around L4, this was never "your territory". However if you get time to play p8, then it's fine.]
;W[cm]C[F];B[co];W[dm];B[ej]C[Something like G8 is in place now, but then B might play H17 and enlarge both his territory and his moyo.]
;W[gc];B[fm];W[fl];B[fn]C[R: Overplay... G8 is the right response (see var)]

(;W[eo]C[R: See var in move 59..];B[fk]C[R: at the moment, your g2 stones are close to death. You should take care of them first! everything else is secondary... They are too big to lose...]

(;W[ge]TR[ec][cd][pf][cj][ej]C[Feeling I should reduce Black's territory while preparing a box shape of my own. But the marked stones give B a decisive advantage.

R: you must take care of g2 stones first!!! everything else is secondary.

What if black cuts at H5 now? You might die...]
(;B[ef]C[R: b must cut now! see var];W[io];B[ip]C[F];W[gg]C[OK this is definitely bad timing]
;B[ol];W[nf]C[This is much better, and I was lucky B allowed me to play here

R: black should still attack g2... see var.]
(;B[ng]
(;W[of]C[looks weird, but in the game I figured since its sente it cant be bad

R: actually this is the wrong thinking. Not all sente is good, and this sente is very bad because it solidifies black, gets rid of any taste.]
;B[og];W[mg]TR[of][og]C[A mistake

R: The mistake is the exchange of triangled stones.];B[mf]
(;W[me]C[R: It is usually (but not always) bad to atari the cutting stone.
See var.];B[lf];W[le];B[kf];W[je];B[kh];W[mh];B[ll]C[A huge gain by Black, probably time to resign
