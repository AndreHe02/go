;B[pd]C[Art:
My name is Joseph and I am a 1k* on IGS.  Thank you for letting me review your game!  I've done my best to comment on the game, but pleased remember to take my suggestions with a grain of salt.  Only professionals have any hope of definitively saying what the best move in a situation is.

I felt some of the key issues in this game were:
1.) Black played very poorly in the corners.  White needed to take better advantage of this.
2.) Moves 54 and 60 for white were nearly passes.  Barring the accident by black at the end, they would have gained white 5 points total, which is much too small.
3.) White failed to adequately pressure the two weaker groups that black created.  Doing so would have resulted in a much closer game.]
;W[qq]C[I say: hi];B[cd];W[dp];B[dj];W[ec]C[This move isn't terrible, but perhaps better might be R14, a nice extension resulting in a moyo-type game.  However, if invasion is your style, I think this can be played.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[dd]C[Empty triangle means this is very inefficient on black's part.  White should punish this. See the variation]

(;W[ic];B[ee]
(;W[jq]C[K3 may have been my first mistake

K3 probably wasn't the best.  Your suggestion of R14 seems good.  However, if you wish to play something with the E16 stones, G16 is locally better than your suggested F16.]
;B[lc];W[db]C[D18 is a very slow move, especially since it ends in gote.  If black plays E18 at some point, w F18 is a perfectly fine response, so D18 is not urgent.  G16, moving out to the middle, is still a good choice if you want a local move.]

;B[ge];W[jb];B[cn]C[As W, I feel really behind now

Yes, the top ended very poorly for you and C6 exploits that fact nicely.]
;W[fp];B[fh];W[qj];B[pp];W[pq];B[qp]C[Another joseki mistake by black that white should punish.]
;W[op];B[qn]
(;W[qg]C[I'm not sure if there is a better move than R13

R13 isn't terrible, with the later goal of pressuring the black R4 stones.  However, the whole right side looks pretty uninteresting.  I think i may have perferred playing P5 in an effort to extend your lower moyo.]
;B[qe];W[ql]C[I still think P5 is a better way to pressure these stones.]
;B[oo];W[np];B[no];W[mp]C[N4 is somewhat submissive.  Was there a reason you didn't play N5?]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[sq]C[Wow, very small move by black, especially being so strong on the left and with plenty of room to live in the center.  White should play elsewhere.]
;W[sr]C[Ouch, this move just provokes black to live and removes the aji at S5]

(;W[fr]C[Maybe something better than F2.

I put in a few variations of moves that came to my mind.];B[ho]

(;W[fn];B[em]
(;W[jk]C[This move seems rather strange.  It doesn't claim any territory and there is little danger of black forming points here.  What is it doing?]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[kp];W[lp];B[kn];W[kh]MA[fm][ln][nc][bo][rf]C[This is similar to K9.  Remember, it's very difficult to make center points.  I think I would prefer any of the marked points.  They're each sente and help reduce black's points.]
;B[le];W[ln];B[kl];W[ng]C[Don't run away from a fight.  The L4/L6 stones are the crucial issue here.  M7 seems vital.]
;B[qi]C[This seems to be an overplay.  Regardless, white let black off too easily.]

Yes, very tough at this point for white to win.  Without the mistake at the end by black, it would have been an easy win.  (No comment beyond this point.)]
