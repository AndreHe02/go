C[Game played over lunch. White lost by 1.5 but passed on winning
move. (Was late for meeting after lunch.)

I'm John (W) and played good friend Scott. Please review for
both of us.   Some help on direction of play and advice on generally
bad moves for both of us.

We both had large surrounded territories (which is unusual for
us.) Some advice on how to invade/reduce chunks of territory
would be helpful as well.

We are both about the same level, informally told to be 14 or
15kyu.

Thank you.


Hello John, Hello Scott,

my name is Christian Reiling and I will do a review for you.

I am 5k* on IGS and 1 dan in Germany.];B[dp];W[dd];B[pd];W[pq]
LB[po:A]TR[pd]C[The book "Direction of Play" states that playing the 4,4 point
wants to play stones towards the sides. I couldn't decide which
of black's sides to deal with. I decided to go for territory.
should I have played the 4,4 here myself?

There is no doubt, that 4-4 point would be ok. And it is also
true, that a black kakari at A would make full use of the marked
star point stone.

But I can not really say that this is bad move.


When professionals say this or that move is not the optimum,
it is not said that such a move is a disadvantage in a game with
weaker amateurs.

Go is free game, and if you want to play 3-4 here, just do it!]
;B[iq]LB[po:E][dj:D][cf:C][jd:B][fc:A]C[But this seems really strange to me.

This is neiter a shimari, nor a proper extension from the star
point.

And what is even more important, is: "this is the most uninteresting
side of the board".

Shocked? - I hope not.

Look at the 3-4 point in the lower right corner.

This point makes influence on the right side and territory on
the lower side.

This is the reason, why the lower side - especially the 3rd line
here - is not that interesting now.

What i would suggest are the move A,B,C,D or E.

Especially E deals in the right way with the 3-4 point, as explained
before.];W[hc]LB[jd:A]C[This move is also no shimari and too narrow for an extension.

But here the upper side is playable, especially the 3rd line,
because of the star point in the upper right.

So, If an extension here, it should be at A.

This is the center of both starpoints, making maximum use of
the own left starpoint and eliminating maximum influence of the
right opponent starpoint.];B[lc]C[This is the least interesting side, because white ist already
(relatively) strong here.];W[qo]C[I was tired of playing influence-only games, so I went for at
least one piece of territory early.];B[cf]C[Good move!]
(;W[ci]C[I had to pincer here because I felt the alternative would have
been difficult to deal with. See var.

The pincer is ok - good move!]
(;B[df]LB[fc:D][cc:C][ff:B][ef:A]C[This is not playable, it's a very heavy shape.

I would here suggest A, maybe B, surely C or even D.

See variation.]
(;W[cm]C[This is the wrong side to defend/attack.

Look at the two black stones - they are heavy, but your single
starpoint stone is bit thin against them - there you should reinforce.

See variation.]
(;B[cn]C[Strengthens White!

See variation.];W[dm];B[cd]C[Too soft. See variation before.]
;W[cc]C[Good move.];B[de]LB[dc:A]C[Bad shape. Better cut at A.]
;W[dc]LB[bd:A]C[Better first atari at A.];B[ch];W[di];B[dh]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[rf];W[pc];B[oc]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[qk];B[qj]LB[mq:A]C[Black had bigger moves like A. Contact moves only make the opponent
stronger.

Yes, you are right.];W[pk];B[pi]C[Strange.];W[lq]C[Good move. Double wing formation.


By the way ...

The extensions from the shimari should be usually far wider,
but there is of course not enaugh room :) .

In general your extensions were to narrow.]
(;B[kq]C[Such move are only played, when you are in danger!]
;W[lp]C[White is happy.];B[ei]C[Yes, this is good.];W[ej];B[fj]

(;B[jb]LB[bc:D][bi:C][bm:B][rk:A]C[I think A, B, C, or D would have been worth more points than
this.

I agree, that this move is a bit strange.

Your suggestion D is an overplay. See variations.];W[ib];B[kc]

It's a pity that you didn't see s13 - if you had won.


I hope I could help you with my comments.

If you have further questions, feel free to ask.
