;B[pd]C[ PacoRuiz 6k*: Hello. sk1 6k*: Hello.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[pk];W[qo]C[Paco:Bad move. q5 if he wants to move in this area

wild : yes I agree. That's the Chinese fuseki.];B[np]C[P:r4 better

wild : yes, r4 is better. with that the position of q9 becomes excellent.]
;W[oo];B[rq]C[wild : I can understand intention of s3 is to prevent white s3/R3 to build eyespace. But I feel it is a little passive. White can't get 2 eyes at corner. Even if it did, it would give black chance to completely seal it in the corner.

It is important black continue to play here to pressure white. I think there is a directional issue here but I can't decide which is better, i.e. to push white towards top right or to push white towards center. My intuition is towards pushing white towards center. So I will consider r7/q7.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qr]C[wild : I will consider r4 but be prepared to give up corner in exchange for moyo. see var]
;W[qp];B[rp]C[wild : this leaves bad aji];W[oq];B[pr];W[op]
;B[jp];W[nq]TR[mr]C[P:too small

wild : not small. this gives black no eyespace at all but it may not be the best move to destroy black's foundation. I would have played n2.]
;B[lq];W[ro];B[or];W[nr];B[rr]C[wild : Black has lost the advantage it has in playing first. White group is very strong, making black's group to its left weak.]
;W[mp]TR[hq]C[P: too small

wild : yes. but idea is right to continue attack on this black group. To attack, consider region of h3. Black group has no eyespace.]
;B[de]TR[fq]C[wild : Good in general. F3 more urgent now.];W[no]
C[P: It would have been better to stop the ladder in other place

wild : This is very bad. white has only remove a useless black stone that has no harm whatsoever to white's strongly connected group. No need to even stop the ladder.]
;B[fq]C[wild : Yes, very important move. Black has now gain back the advantage of playing first.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo];W[ep];B[fr];W[dn];B[jc]TR[pk][ph]C[P: Im not very happy about this move. I think I would have attack 4 but Im not sure about it.

wild : marked black stone is too close to very strong white group though it is light. It may be good to strenthen it a bit by playing in the region of Q12.]
;W[gc];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[cl]SQ[ci]C[wild : too far. normal to play c11.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[bl];B[bk];W[bn]SQ[cl]C[wild : white's moves 42-46 have made black's c8 a good move. the feeling one gets with white 42 was that he/she was trying to protect the corner but there's another gap at the bottom. so the protection is incomplete]
;B[cj];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[hq];W[hn];B[io];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[pf];W[kc]SQ[lc]C[P: very closed

wild : I agree. It should be at m17];B[kd]SQ[kb]C[wild: I would prefer hane at L18. Takes away white's eyespace.]
;W[lc];B[jd];W[nf];B[ph];W[ge];B[me];W[ne];B[jg]SQ[me]TR[ne]
C[wild : The marked exchange did nothing for black. Should have left it. May get a chance to play O15 later on in the game.]
;W[fh]TR[cj][bk][cl][dl]C[P: c12 better?

wild : Hard to tell. The marked group is not weak, so black would only have to take care of the group on top. But this move is not too good, it's like inviting black to patch up his weakness.]
;B[dh];W[mh];B[lg];W[mg];B[mf]TR[jj][kj]C[wild : A bit slow. Could have 2-point jump to K10 or L10.]

;W[nb];B[jb];W[kb];B[rm]TR[rl][qm]C[P: too long?

wild : Yes. More natural to be at R7 or s8.];W[qj];B[qi]TR[pk]
[rm]C[q10 better?

wild : Yes, I would play Q10. This is like telling white, ok you take that 2 stones.]
;W[pj];B[qk]TR[qi]C[wild : This is bad. Not consistent with your  earlier move.]

;W[er];B[oh];W[ng];B[os]C[P: It should have been done before

wild : I don't think so. It's safe.];W[fs];B[gr]TR[gs]C[wild : I think it's ok to play G1.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[if];B[ie];W[he];B[jf];W[hg];B[kn]C[P: It should have done before?

wild : Yes, I didn't see it earlier either.];W[ko];B[jn];W[mn]
;B[lp];W[lo];B[nn];W[mm];B[ll];W[kp];B[kq]C[P: m2 better

wild : No I think this is fine.];W[lr];B[mq]TR[kr]C[wild : This is the move that allowed white to live! Should have just blocked at L2. No way white can make an eye there (unless black allow white to make two consecutive moves there).]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[jq];W[ns]
(;B[im]C[wild : Note that the big white group is not out of the woods yet. If black make he move first, white dies. See variation.]

TR[rj][sk][oe]C[P:It seems to be all dead, but its not. I wonder how I should have done this.

wild : It is all dead. Marked points are all false eyes. In fact, it should have been dead much earlier.]
;W[le];B[md]TR[ld]C[wild : Should just block at m16.];W[ld]
;B[lf];W[ke]C[wild : Too late to save it now. I think the black will lose the killing race with white's big group.]
;B[mc]C[P: very bad. There's no way to kill and I dont wanted to accept it.

wild : This is a game black should have won. It's leading for most of the game. You missed a few crucial moves, the most critical of which is move number 229.]
