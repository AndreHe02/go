AB[pd][dp]C[dear commentator!

i have added a few comments of mine, and would be glad if you can give me some hints if i´m right with my ideas.   thanks for your work and your efforts!

Duumvir

DRS: Hi.];W[pp];B[dd]C[DRS: The first four moves are 4-4 points.  This means this is an influence/fighting game, not a territorial game.  If you like territory, you may want to study 3-4 or 3-3 even.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[DRS: This move is inconsistent with the D16, a 4-4.  D14 is a consistent, influence-oriented move that puts greater pressure on F17.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[DRS: Same comment here as for move 4, plus the handicap go books recommend K17 or K16 to separate White's top side into two weak groups.]
;W[ch];B[dc]C[i wanted to stabalize my corner, with the option of the future attack on f17 or c12. is this ok?

DRS: You've stabilized your corner, but it would be better to run out into the center.
  This is not a large corner, and this is only a two-stone game, so you shouldn't play moves that are quite this slow-and-steady.]
;W[ic];B[cj]C[and now the attack on c12..

DRS: This is good.  Prevent White's base.];W[eh];B[ej]C[DRS: I like this too, although arguably O3, R6 or K4 would be better.]
;W[cn];B[fq]C[what do you think about this answer?

DRS: This is still too territory-oriented for a 4-4 like D4.  It's good to play low like this if White has a stone around H3 or so, but I think usually with a 4-4, you should play 4-6 after a kakari at C6.

DRS: Also, in this position, my first reaction is B C5, W D6, B F4.  This makes White heavy, gives you something to chase, while at the same time you take a firmer grip on the corner (not a solid grip, but a firmer grip).]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[DRS: W should probably have played at C8 to make a small base]
;B[en]C[i wanted to put pressure on the white group and getting influence toward the center. is this ok?

DRS: Seems ok.];W[dl]C[good move of white, splits my groups]
;B[jq]C[wanted to make some territory, and playin round k6 in the future

DRS: I do not think this move is urgent, and I don't think it's as big as a kakari at O3 or R6.
B can easily get settled with B2 or K3 later.];W[lq];B[jp]C[DRS: I think this is slow.  If you want to play locally, K5 is faster, and still pretty safe.]
;W[fl];B[gj];W[ff];B[eg]C[wanted to fight at this moment. do you think its correct to start a fight here? (in the end i won this local battle, but i´m not sure if this was correct)

DRS: I would probably R6 or R8 here. If you push and cut here, you may end up damaging your E10 group.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[dg];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[de];B[ei];W[dh];B[fd]
;W[fe];B[ed];W[gd];B[ce];W[dj];B[di];W[bj]C[what can i play against this move?

DRS: C11 is fine.];B[ci];W[bi];B[dk]C[DRS: Two things about this move.

DRS: 1) D10 was a small stone.  It does not connect your weak group or groups, nor does it separate your opponent's weak group or groups.  So it is worth very little.    DRS: On the other hand, B12 is an oiotoshi kill of a decent-sized group, plus it connects your corner with your center giving you less to worry about later.]
;W[bk];B[gh];W[he];B[qn];W[qq];B[pj];W[qh];B[qj];W[oh];B[pc]
;W[nf];B[ih];W[jf];B[cl];W[ck];B[bg]C[DRS: This erases the beautiful move at B12.  It is a "thank you move"]
;W[bh];B[dm];W[el];B[cm];W[bn];B[bl];W[dn];B[em];W[ak];B[al]
;W[hi]C[hard to handle; whats the best response here?

DRS: I think either G11 or H12 is fine.];B[fj]C[wanted to play safe..]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[hj];B[gl];W[fm];B[fn];W[gm];B[gk];W[hm];B[ah]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[br];B[ho];W[gi];B[fi];W[hh];B[ai];W[rh];B[rf]
;W[hl];B[on];W[np];B[cg]C[DRS: Not necessary.   You have three liberties, White had two.  Better to play a more important point elsewhere.  It is generally best to stay one move ahead of your opponent in a capturing race.  If you're not sure how many moves it will take each side to kill, count and see how much risk you can tolerate/induce.]
;W[gn];B[fo]C[I like G5 better.  More pressure on H8, and it doesn't make an empty triangle.]
;W[rc]C[whats a good answer against this move?

DRS: I like R18.  IMO, this is attack of White's is a bit overambitious.  Usually if a corner has more than 7 spaces in it, it will be hard to kill.  But as with all things go, that is not always true.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[oc]C[DRS: I don't like this move. It makes an empty triangle, and it does nothing to put pressure on S17.]
;W[qb]C[again: how to play against this invasion?

DRS: It's getting harder to kill White inside.  Perhaps S16 or S19 will work though.]
;B[rj];W[rd]C[DRS: S19 still might kill.];B[pg]C[DRS: I don't like this move.  If you must play it, save it for late endgame.  It makes no points for you, and begs White to strengthen his or her group.]
;W[ph];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh]C[i think, this was a bad manouvre! but what else to play in this situation?

DRS: I'd try S19.];W[oj]C[now white has a big moyo at the middle top!]
;B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[md];B[of];W[mf];B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]
;B[im];W[qg];B[oe];W[sd];B[sb];W[pa]
(;B[na]C[such a lousy move! :-D

DRS: Yes.  Good if you learn from it.];W[oa];B[mb];W[mc];B[qe]
;W[ma];B[ok]C[maybe its better to play n11?  trying to connect th n12 group to my other stones?

after the next moves i realizes that it would have been best to attack th white g6 group, maybe with j6! (is this right?)

DRS: I think you can probably get away with not defending R10, so yes, something like H6 is probably good.]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[in];B[jm];W[jn];B[km];W[hn]C[DRS: I like L6.  But I'd probably count before playing it.  If I'm ahead without killing K6, I'd just play G5.  But if I'm behind, I'd play L6.]
;B[go]C[is L6 better?];W[kn];B[lm];W[lo];B[pi]C[DRS: Of what benefit was this?  It begs White to make a stronger shape, and erases a ko threat.  Sometimes, if you don't push at White and beg him or her to strengthen his or her shapes, a fight will spill over from another area and destroy something that was left weak - something which would become a rock against which your fighting stones are crushed if you beg White to strengthen.]

;W[rq];B[qp];W[nm];B[nn];W[om];B[pm];W[mm];B[ln];W[ko]C[is there a possibility to attack the lower right corner group of white, maybe round p3 or something like that?

DRS: I think the lower right is too big to attack well.  Unless you think you are way behind and don't mind acting out of desperation.]

DRS: I think so.  Probably D5 is better.  With D5, you get a kill in sente.]
