komi: 5.5   Questions: I (black) have  the feeling, that I could have played  more agressively in the beginning.  Please give me some hints, where I  could have played better.


Hello,
I´ll do my very best!];B[qd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[pj]C[This move is not bad at all, but if you  want to play more agressively play a  kakari in the upper left now e.g..]
;W[jc];B[ce]C[good!];W[fd];B[ee]MA[cc][ch][ci][di]C[This move is a bit strange. It shows  your fondness of bigger mojos :-)

You should think of mojos as  spheres of influence rather than of  territory. The opponent should  invade to make it easier for you to  gain influence to the center and   some territory at the edge while  attacking.

In this case it is to easy for white to  get a group settled at the left edge.  Therefore trying to build up a mojo  immediately is not efficient. You  could even get into trouble because  your two stones have no base yet.
So I´d suggest to extend to one of  the marked points instead.]
;W[od];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc]C[phi: was this too far? I think S16  leaves less possibility to enter later.


B S16, W S17 would be a big  success for W.  There is no need to simply give up  the corner. Your move is good and it  is definitely sente.]
;W[pc];B[dj]LB[re:A][rb:B]C[BUT!

You should play once more in the  upper right corner. A move at A or B  would give you a very strong group,  a lot of almost secure territory and  the basis to attack the lower right  corner or to invade at the upper  edge.
But, your right, a extension from  your two stones in the upper left also  is important.
Here you can see a natural problem  of a mojo-oriented style of play.  The  distances between the stones are  quite big so you often have to defend  and thus give up the initiative.]
;W[iq]C[A little slow.]
(;B[fq]C[quite defensive!
This is a good chance to attack and  to try to gain something while  attacking.
See variation for one example.];W[lq];B[nf]C[You just help W to defend a  weakness!
This move is to one-dimensional.
Better attack the lower right corner.];W[md];B[cm]C[Defensive again!]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[lf]C[WHY ?];W[qm]C[This part of the board is much more  interesting now. Both players can get  some territory there.]
;B[je]LB[qk:A][eh:B][bc:C]C[phi: I thaugth of A(R9), B(E12) and  C(B17) also.

B is too submissive but A and C  (perhaps even one line to the right of  C) are the biggest moves now if you  don´t want to invade somewhere.
Again you move just helps W. The  only thing you get is a slight  increase in influence.  You´re trying to hard to build up a  mojo in the center, you would need  several more moves to close it, so  W still has the chance to reduce and  he profits at the edge from moves  like this one.]
;W[jd];B[le]C[Again!];W[ld];B[hp]LB[qk:A][eh:B][bc:C]MA[gj]
[hm]C[phi: this makes a big moyo. But still I  wonder if A, B and C or even better  moves are around?

I´d prefer to invade in the lower right.  But (A and) C is good too.

I don´t see much of a mojo now. The  lower left center is still open at two  sides and even if  you manage to  close it around the marked locations,  you still only get about 20 points.  And that is less than what you can  get by C or any invasion.]
;W[fh];B[dh];W[fj];B[fl]LB[el:A]C[phi: I was afraid that white could  reduce my moyo. Playing on A(E8)  would have been more secure I  think.

Locally your  move isn´t bad, but it is  too small! (As mentioned above)]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B[en];W[ip];B[ho]C[What is left of your "mojo" now is  almost nothing!]
;W[rj]
(;B[qi]C[phi: I did not find a way to block more  efficient. See variation to the  previous move. Is there any better  protection?

I don´t see one either.];W[ri];B[qh]LB[rh:A]C[Now you can play at A.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[cd]C[BIG!];B[qk]LB[qq:A]C[phi: this is sente. But I think there  are more important points than  reducing my aji.
What would you have played?

Definitely A.];W[rk];B[qg]MA[rb][bd][he][hr]C[phi: this was not necessary. Where  are the important moves for black?

Right not necessary at all.
There are no really weak groups to  attack . But there are
1. two invadeable corners
2. big endgame moves (marked)
3. some potential in the upper right  center.];W[be];B[bf];W[cf]
;B[cg];W[de];B[df]C[not too big, but ok];W[rb];B[qq]C[good]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[nr]
;W[mr];B[ol]C[because it is no threat for any W  group it gives W the time to reduce  the possible mojo!]

(see the marked locations)];W[hq];B[gq];W[ie]
(;B[if]LB[jf:A]C[phi: overplay? I think so. See  variation to the previous move. I  think A(K14) was better.

;B[sd];W[rc];B[se];W[pd];B[eo]C[Summing up it´s difficult to give you  some exact hints. You don´t play  silly moves and you seem to build  up aplan before playing, what is very  important.

The key to improvement for you  could be to get better survey, to look  at the board as a whole.
This starts with the analysis of  territory and influence. Who got how  much of both mof it.  AND are there weaknesses? If you  are leading in territory and influence  you can afford to strengthen your  weak groups. If you are not leading  you have to decide wether to catch  up by enlarging your own territory  or influence or by destroying some  of your opponent´s. As you see this  also includes your question of  beeing more aggressive or less.

As your opponent trys to win too, it  also is a question of flexibility. If you  apparently don´t get what you gained  for think of changing your plan (if  necessary). The disadvantages of  big moyos e.g. is that if the  opponent invades succesfully, it  often is verry difficult to get  compensation for it.

I know that these are quite abstract  thoughts, but perhaps they help you  by showing some important things  you can think of .

If you have further questions feel  free to ask.

Bye,
Martin])
