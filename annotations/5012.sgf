Hi Thomas,

this is Zoran Rilak aka wayward[2k\] on KGS.  I will be reviewing your review of the game.  If you have any questions or comments on the review, feel free to contact me at zoran.rilak@gmail.com .]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qj]C[-- This is a mistake by White.  If Black had only a single stone in the upper right corner, then r10 would be playable, because White could extend in both directions.  As it stands, it looks premature.  White was probably afraid of Black forming a large moyo early on which he wouldn't be able to match.  If that's the case, then top and bottom plays, where moyos meet, are much more important than the side.  Black seems to have understood this as his continuation develops the q3 stone in both directions, making use of r16 shimari.]
;B[qn];W[qg];B[jp]SQ[on][qn][pq]C[move 9 is to wide, the two marked stones are wide so it might be better to play move 9 at n3 but this feels awkward, for me 9 would be played at d14 or d6. the idea is a priciple of GO that is keep your opponents stones separated. by play at 9 you are forcing gosei to play as he did, what you what is for him to make you move to that place you want to move, it does two things one it covers your true intent, two it gives you sente and a free move.

---

Actually I rather like k4.  It is a healthy extension away from q3/r6, and Black has good prospects to a continuation both with a shoulder hit at q9 and an approach at f3.  Early opening is no time to be thinking about securing territory (except as a result of corner fights); Black n3 would be a move that completely erases Black's advantage gained by White's r10 mistake.  It doesn't do anything significant in terms of early group development since Black's oogeima shimari is already stable (it can extend either to the left or to r8, which is almost sente in terms of White r10).

Another important point is that Black is not 'forcing' White to play n3, as n3 would be a mistake both for Black on move 9 and for White on move 10.  When White plays n3, he creates another weak group early in the game (first one being the two stones at the right) and it would be only too easy for Black to chase them one towards the other, then divide and gain enormous strength in the center/right.]

(;B[np]C[this is not good. period.   this is the beginning of the game
there are no ko threats anywhere. two things one if you have to fight it is because you are behind in the count, two
ko's are based on fighting.
between 9 and 11 they for me are your losing moves.
and make no mistake because you won this game
these moves have become as good to you and you will consciencely make these moves again, but with a stronger player you will get punished and you will not know why. if you must play here then play 11 at n5 there-by using k4 force also. for me i would play 11 at m3 make gosei struggle for life this way you make it easy for him to get eyes.

-- Black is not being severe enough.  Of course he HAS to play there, White has handed him a weak stone on a silver plate.  I would say that the proper direction of play would be to cap at n5, building thickness against r10 and making White live small if at all (see variation).
Also, where is the ko you mention?];W[kq];B[kp];W[nq];B[mp]
;W[oq];B[op];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[lq];W[lr];B[lp];W[jq];B[iq]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[ho]C[keep in mind that the game of GO is about 1/2 point nothing esle matters.
it is NOT about capturing (killing) it is about cooperation give and take understanding which groupe is worth more when to cut your loses if you learn to count , how to count in the stage of you go playing then when and if you get to single digit kyu then you will be hard to beat

-- As reviewers, we should strive to be legible and easy to understand.  That means not only using proper English grammatical structure and punctuation, but also illustrating our points in a manner which is easy to grasp.  As a rule of thumb, I avoid to raise any topics which are difficult to illustrate because they are too complex or haven't manifested themselves wholly in the game at hand.  Those topics that I do raise, I always try to put into action and clearly state the opposition of "right" and "wrong" style of play from that viewpoint.  Here, for example, Black needs to understand that the trapped White group is: a) alive; b) not important to the course of the game, being already shut tightly; c) marginally significant to Black as a possible source of ko threats much later in the game.  This translates well into the eternal "sente vs. gote" idea.  Black should be made to understand the significance of his strong outer wall, how it relates to other stones on the board, and more particularly why White h5 is a sloppy move (avoid peeps, esp. avoid diagonal peeps, don't play close to thickness).]
;B[js];W[kr];B[ks];W[ms];B[nr];W[or];B[rr];W[rs];B[qs];W[rq]
;B[ss];W[rp];B[pp];W[ns];B[io]C[-- Wrong connection.  A simple, solid connection at j4 is what Black needs to play if he really feels he needs to solidify his position there.  However, I would much rather see a move like f3 or f4 which would give eyes to j2/j3 in case they get cut off, threaten to take the corner and to separate the h5 stone.  Even f3/f4 may be a bit slow here given that White can capture the lower right corner after Black's failed attack on r2, but still, it is better to develop your groups instead of connecting when possible.

Another idea is to play h4 and ignore White peep at j5.];W[hp]
;B[ip];W[fq]C[-- Here White successfully erases Black's strength along the bottom, which anulls all his plays at j2, j3, j4 and j5.]
;B[pk]C[-- Good idea by Black, but came a bit late.  Here it should be stressed that q9 is greatly diminished in value by his failed attack at the bottom and subsequent loss of a big corner.  So, the idea of attacking r10/r13 should be complimented, but criticized at the same time for coming only at this point.]

-- I think you are being too harsh on the fellow here.  He would benefit more from a structured analysis of the game, illustrations of proper plays in place of his mistakes and variations which exploit his opponent's weaknesses.  You are right about "learning when not to fight": beginners (and experienced players alike) fall into the heat of the battle all too easy.  For that purpose us reviewers need to gather what little knowledge of the game we have, put it in use and show the correct path to gaining power and territory.  We all used to be double-digit kyus at some point :)

I end my review here with you.  As to your style of play which I could glimpse from your remarks, I would advise you think a bit more about balance of power, how to develop while attacking and the fact that the best way to create territory is not to create it at all (i.e. it should grow of itself).
