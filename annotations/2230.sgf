C[Game Reviewed by Richard Rumley.  richard@rumley.net
I am currently ranked about 5 kyu AGA
All of my comments begin with RR:
Any questions, please send me an email.

The person asking for the review (Andreas Olsson ) is playing black.

My Analysis after reviewing the game:  Black needs to learn a little bit of restraint, and not fight with every move.  Sometimes, playing further away from an opponent's stone is more of an attack than touching the stones.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qq];B[co]C[RR:  So far, so good for black.  White is developing on the lower side, while black has moyo on the top side.]
;W[fp];B[cl];W[cf]MA[jq]C[RR:  White should expand on the bottom.  It is way too early to jump into a fight.]
;B[ch]TR[ce][df][gd][cj]C[RR:  I think that black should use it's strength to build on the upper side.  The sequence Black C 15; D 14; G 16, C10.  This would give white a secure base on the left side of the board, but would give black a nice base on the top side.
However, I think that by black using the D16 stone as an attack stone, black is doing well, so I cannot say anything bad about this move!]
;W[bd];B[df]TR[cc]C[RR:  Keeping white out of the corner should be the direction of attack.  It is a good idea to build a wall with the black stones, but I don't think it would work here.  If I was playing white now, I would play at the C17 spot, to make a base in the corner.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[cc];B[jc]TR[dc]C[RR:  I think that black should play one more down here to the 3rd line.  Also, the current jump is 1 space too far.  A 3 stone high wall should jump out 3+1=4 spots, or J17.]
;W[eb]C[RR:  White under cuts blacks moyo, and expands its base.  This is a good move for white.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[ec];B[ed]C[RR:  Empty triangle...]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[eh]C[RR:  This cut is too soon.  Need to protect the other three stones.]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[ci];B[dj];W[bh];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[bg];B[fj]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[hc];B[gd]TR[ib]C[RR:  One rule I like to follow:  If your only move is to make an empty triangle, then find another move.  I think that playing at J18 is a better move.  Force white to try an live.]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[ib]C[RR:  Because of black's empty triangle, white can attack and then capture some stones.  Black's position is difficult now.]
;B[jb];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[qj];W[qn];B[kq]C[RR:  good spot to play to get in the middle of white's moyo.]
;W[hq];B[nq];W[qh]C[This sequence here, i wonder if i could have done better?

RR:  Black's next move is a contact move at Q12.  If you look at the area, you will see 4 black stones and 1 white stone.  Since white is weak, and black is strong, black should play distance away from white.  By playing contact moves, white will get stonger, and black will not be able to use the strength that has been developed.]

(;B[ph]C[RR:  Contact moves while you are strong only makes your opponent stronger.]
;W[pg];B[oh]TR[qg]C[RR:  Once these moves have been made, I think that black has to cut at R13]
;W[qg];B[og]TR[pf]C[RR:  This move pushes white towards the other white stones, making white stronger.  Perhaps pushing up, keeping the two groups seperated would be a better idea.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[oe];B[pe]TR[od]C[RR:  Empty triangle...This helps with eye development, but it also helps white.  I don't see eye space on the edge, so pushing into the middle is still the best move.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[od];B[mg];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]TR[rb]C[RR:  The black stones are dead.  By playing at S18, black can start a ko for life.]
;W[rb];B[se];W[rf];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[pm];W[pi];B[oi]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[qm];B[oo];W[rj];B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[ha];B[jf]
;W[nm];B[on]C[RR:  Black has a huge central influence.  white is trying anything to live.  If black plays away from white, and makes a big net, then white will loose this battle.]
;W[mm];B[jo];W[oj]C[RR:  This cut doesn't mean much to black, since black is connected at the top and bottom.]
;B[nj];W[ok];B[nl]TR[mk]C[RR:  This type of move will help to make white strong.  Better to play out and watch white squirm.]
;W[ni];B[nk];W[jm];B[km]TR[in]C[RR:  Play big moves away from the white stones.  Again, look at the marked area at J6.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[kn];B[lm];W[ln];B[ll];W[jn]C[RR:  Black may not have lost any stones in the last few moves, but white now has a strong group, facing the three stones in the lower left.  The cross-cut by black was what started this.]

;B[ij];W[lk];B[ml];W[le];B[lf];W[me];B[bq];W[cr];B[bk];W[kf]
;B[ke]TR[kg]C[RR:  In a fight like this, I like to be conservative and atari from the inside.]
;W[kg];B[jg]C[Misread there, thought i was safe playing k13.]

;W[jd];B[id];W[kd];B[ic];W[hb];B[ma];W[ja];B[kb];W[lb];B[la]
;W[mb];B[na];W[ob];B[je]C[RR:  We are getting close to endgame, and it's time to look for the big moves.  There are some big plays in the lower right, and even the lower left.  Leave these points until later.]
;W[ld];B[pr];W[pq];B[oq];W[qr];B[os]C[RR:  Since making eyes is not a problem, I would simply connect at P2.  By playing this move, white has 2 ko threats, and black doesn't really gain anything.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[jp];B[jq];W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[iq];W[ir];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[qo];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[pp]C[RR:  small move and an empty triangle.  Play somewhere else.]
;W[lo];B[no]C[RR:  empty triangle eye killer.....Ok, I stand corrected on my earlier empty triangle statement.]
;W[go];B[hp];W[io];B[jo];W[ko];B[lq];W[cp];B[bp];W[cq];B[eo]
;W[en];B[dn];W[ep];B[do]TR[br][bj][kh][mj][qs]C[RR:  Again, small move.  Look at the marked points.]

;W[bi];B[aj];W[ck];B[bl];W[dm];B[bo];W[ek];B[dl];W[oa];B[ka]
C[RR:  Again, small move which is not needed yet.  I know time is running down.  R1 is probably the biggest move right now.]

;W[hi];B[hj];W[pn]C[Here we have extreme latence and i was in byo yomi and lost the game because i didnt have time to respond(less than 3 seconds). But i have added the moves we talked about after the game since we wanted to know who really won.

Also, after the game i noticed that i could probably have killed whites lower left corner witha  peep at f2? Or is there some move i am missing?

Anxiously awaiting a review, thanks.

RR:  White has 12 prisoners + 21 + 10 + 43 + 9 = 95 points
RR:  Black has 6 prisoners + (1 big territory of 90) = 96 points.
Too close to call with my counting skills!!!

Let me make a variation for the F2 peek.
After several minutes, I belive that the peek at F2 does kill the white group.]
