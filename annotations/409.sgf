C[game reviewed by Allan Wickberg (lobo2me@igs). comments tagged "l2m".

l2m: i have commented up to move #50. after that, it is basically the same mistake - continous contact fighting when it would be better to keep a distance, or playing elsewhere - repeated for the rest of the game.

l2m: contact fighting is for trying to survive, as it strengthens both parts. to kill, surround first before getting close.

l2m: i am just an "experienced beginner" myself, but i have some games archived, in which i played very much like this, so at least i have learned that lesson :)]
PL[B];B[do];W[qd];B[op];W[cd]TR[dc]C[l2m: so far, so good. white moves are fairly solid, although 4 may be better played at d17 to get more potential along the top by making the stones work together.

l2m: black is playing way too far out in the board; it takes a stronger player to make use of being this aggressive. at this level, the first 20-30 moves should probably be no higher than the third line.]
;B[cj];W[pj]LB[ec:a][fc:b]TR[qp][dq]C[l2m: the lower corners and side are still wide open, so there is plenty of time for white to build good foundation, at e17, or f17 (rather than the corresponding moves at the right corner, since black is stronger on the left) before attacking.

l2m: q10 is not really an attack, either (but maybe it was not indended as such). r4 or d3 are, to me, the obvious points of aggression.]
;B[ec];W[qo]LB[dc:a][cg:b]C[l2m: "urgent before big" is a good rule; lower left can still wait - the top left white stone is threatened.

l2m: c13 is a defensive response; d17 is an agressive response - i think i would go for the latter. then, c13 would be my response to black e 16, alternatively o17 would be my response to black h17.

l2m: white d17 will also push black to defend the upper stone, which will allow white the initiative to attack the lower corners, AFTER securing top stones.]
;B[qq];W[db]C[l2m: good. top left corner needed reinforcement, although black has now secured the lower right corner.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[eb];W[cb]C[l2m: good moves at this part of the board, so far, by both.]
;B[dd]C[l2m: but now black is getting too heavy, i think.];W[ce]
LB[oc:a][lc:b][jc:c]C[l2m: ...and so does white. white's corner is safe, and black has a solid wall up there now, so white should try to limit black's potential on top by strengthening the top right corner (a), and later extend from it (b,then c), given the right opportunity. that would probably be after attacking the lower left corner.]
;B[de];W[df]C[l2m: fighting has its merits, but here,  following black around like this is vastly increasing his ability to extend from the wall along the top, in exchange for just a couple of points for white along the left side.

l2m: "stay away from thickness" indicates that black's wall should be attacked from the opposite side, and from a distance, if attacked at all - apart from the lower right corner, the rest of the board is still wide open.]

;B[gi];W[cf];B[fk];W[dk]TR[cl]C[l2m: white d9 at c8 instead, would be a better way to attack the c10 group -  "don't touch what you intend to kill".

l2m: if white can capture that group, the investment in stones at left might pay off. otherwise, it would be better to leave the two white stones, and attack from the bottom by invading the lower left corner. that way, the e9 group is useful as a possibility to hit black from behind.]
;B[ck];W[dl]TR[dm]C[l2m: white d8 at d7 instead, and white would still have a slim chance to kill.]
;B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dn];B[cn];W[en]C[l2m: at this point, white has not gained any more points since move #28 (at c11), black's left group is safe and strong and will prevent white from getting too many points in the lower left corner, while at the same time gaining good points at the bottom as well as threatening white's e50 group.

l2m: black's wall has some weak spots, but he  may still grab most of the top, so to me white looks like the loser here. appearently, black was not able to realize this potential, so white won anyway. end of comments.]
