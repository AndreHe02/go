C[buckyyowza: Hi pleny.  I will do my best ;-)  I think this game actually has more opening mistakes than the last, making it difficult for black to catch up in the middle game.  Then white makes several middle game blunders which black _almost_ takes advantage of.  It is quite an exciting game!  In general, I'd suggest that you read a little more carefully, watching especially for bad ajikeshi and losing sente - your biggest downfalls in this game.  Read on for more specific comments.

Hi Mark I play black in this game? I think I made a lot of mistake.  Please point out]
;B[pd]C[hakushuu: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
pleny: hi];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[ej]C[buckyyowza: Strange fuseki by white.  This seems almost a misclick.]
;B[jp];W[gq];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[cg];B[ec]LB[fe:A]C[buckyyowza: black plays too many tsuke (touching plays) in this corner, from this shape it is better to jump out to F15 as soon as possible and establish a thick dragon.]
;W[eb]
(;B[fc]C[buckyyowza: F18 seems better, see var.];W[fb];B[dd]
LB[fe:A]C[buckyyowza: F15 would make much better shape.  This tsuke forces white to defend and improve his shape, but does not benefit black's eyespace or thickness, F15 benefits both.]
;W[bc]
(;B[db]LB[bd:A]C[buckyyowza: This play is bad ajikeshi - removing the ability of black to cut white's corner and side groups in sente.  By forcing white to fill C17 from this direction B16 is no longer sente for black. see var.]
;W[cc];B[gb];W[da];B[gc]C[buckyyowza: this result is not terrible as long as black plays something like B15 as soon as possible to prevent white from connecting the upper left corner to the left side moyo.]

(;W[nc];B[lc]SQ[gb][ec][fc][gc][dd][ce][de]C[buckyyowza: Yes, white's play at O17 is just _begging_ for a pincer ;-)  The marked black stones work well together and black will almost definitely get a good position after this joseki.

Is this correct response by b?];W[ne];B[pf];W[ld];B[kd];W[le]
;B[jc];W[be]C[buckyyowza: This play should have been prevented, see #19 and #23.]
;B[jf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[po]LB[np:A]C[buckyyowza: B is not behind yet - white is on the attack and black is building large side moyos with center thickness while white gets small groups in black's sphere.  This is typical "amashi" strategy for white, and usually leads to a fighting game - though normally is not a good choice unless playing white in a no-komi or hanidcap game since it becomes harder to retain sente playing against an equal or stronger player, therefore black should select a joseki that gets sente then attack the left side in a way that weaken's white's invasions.  I'd suggest starting at O4 (see var).

I think b is behind now.
how b play here?]
(;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[rl]LB[nq:A]SQ[jp]C[buckyyowza: S8 is too slack - O3 is the normal play here, and considering the K4 stone is a good choice.  The right side area is not under threat from white's shape.  In fact, white's stones really have little to play from - Q5 was not the best place for white's attack.]
;W[rm];B[np];W[ql];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[sl]LB[cn:A]C[buckyyowza: an overplay by white! This is perfect time to invade at C6.]

(;B[qi]C[buckyyowza: Unnecessary (or at least small gote), see var.  The C6 invasion is much bigger than anything this area.]
;W[jr];B[jq]LB[kq:A]C[buckyyowza: beware the tsuke play ;-) this should be L3 instead, white can L2 now and still be connected into your moyo.]

(;W[ir];B[kr];W[cn]LB[dh:D][el:A][fl:B][fm:C]SQ[be]C[how black can invade?

buckyyowza: Get there sooner ;-) See #23, #38 and #53.  The white stones at B15 and C6 have effectively sealed this big area.  Now reduction is a better choice, try E8, F8, F7, or even D12.  You'll want to be careful now, because though white is ahead due to the lower left moyo, black has a lot of center potential.  Black's best best strategy now is to seal off and then attack white's weak group in the upper right.

Trying too hard to invade a side moyo will invariably result in white reducing your center potential (black's biggest asset!).  With such thickness, black will want to reduce the side and surround a huge moyo in the middle - then white may decide that black's center is getting too big and leave a weakness that can be broken through.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[ep];W[dr];B[eq];W[do]
(;B[er];W[cr]
(;B[gp]TR[gq][ir][jr]C[buckyyowza: These white stones are dangerous to black's invasion, it is more effective to cap them at G5.  Recall that tsuke play is not always good:  Hane is almost always is good, but you cannot hane a stone that isn't touching.]

[gr]SQ[le][ne][gk][pm][ln]C[buckyyowza: compare to the var on #67. Now black is cut up without a base and white is running all over the center. The marked white stones play well together, and the marked black stones are in serious trouble.]
;B[lo]LB[lm:C][mn:B][lp:A]TR[hl][im][km][jn]SQ[kn][ln]C[buckyyowza: Another tsuke play - M4 is much more efficient. It may seem that white's stones are attacked by this play, but they are in fact forced to strengthen; either N6 or M7 will improve white's shape and attack black from here.]
;W[il];B[hk];W[jl]
(;B[mn]C[buckyyowza: K7 works better for black, white is trying to attack from too many angles and therefore losing control of the situation.]
