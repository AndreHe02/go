AB[pd][dp]C[dancinblue [16k\]: hello

RS: Hi. I play most on DGS. You can find me there under my id rasa. Take my comments with a grain of salt, because if anyone higher then I am says something differently, listen to them.

In general I would advise not making contact so quickly. Start reading articles or books on fuseki. Sensei's Library is a very good source of information. For tactics, try not to hane twice from 2 two-stone groups as both of you did. You can get into trouble quickly.]
;W[pp]C[moutard [18k\]: hi];B[cc];W[qi];B[jp];W[jq]C[RS: Immediate contact like W does is not so good in the beginning. The reason being is B can easily come out of this in sente and take a big point. See variation.]

(;B[kq]C[RS: Simply drawing back to j4 is ok. B begins to build a fine wall.]

RS: I believe you're talking about the marked stones. Hmmm, let's see. B gives away 10 points, and W gives away 29 points. An excellent trade for B. See variation for a better W55.]
;B[ci]C[dancinblue [16k\]: pretty much yes.];W[di]C[moutard [18k\]: or one group hitch

RS: "In a cross-cut, extend." This is a go proverb. B should extend to c12 or d9. Hard to say which would be better. W seems to know this proverb. Variation.]

;W[kd];B[ke];W[ld]C[RS: Again, B and W have haned twice from only 2 stones.]
;B[le]
(;W[me]MA[kd][ld][le][ke][jc][ic][jd][id]C[RS: One reason why it's dangerous to hane from 2 stones is all 4 groups marked with an 'x' only have 3 liberties. You should always keep a mental note on all your groups that have 5 liberties or less. I know 5 liberties seems like a lot, but when a group has less then this things can go wrong quickly. With 5 liberties, you should think, "I need to remember that group"; with 4, you should check several times whether it's safe; with 3, do something about it now.

W see this on B's next move. No, no W group was killed, but W was defintely cut in two. The more seperate groups you have the harder they need to fight for life and the less efficient they are in getting territory. When B cuts, W uses, in the end, 13 stones to get 3 points of territory. Sometimes this is necessary, but W should not be satisfied. A 9 dan professional advised that from the very beginning you should imagine your stones as *only* 1 group and play to keep them that way. See variation.]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[md];B[lb];W[jb];B[nc];W[mc];B[mb];W[mf]
;B[kh];W[hd]C[RS: B, your next move is g16, but this is unnecessary. You can connect at f17 or g16 when needed. Simply connect at k15.]

(;B[gd];W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[if];W[jg]C[RS: B sees why it is bad to hane twice from after 2 stones.]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[hh];W[ii];B[hi];W[hj]
(;B[gj]C[RS: From here for the next 120 moves, B has a chance to cut at 'a' because of the 2 hanes after only 2 stones. See variation.]

(;B[fl]LB[el:a]C[RS: Playing straight up at 'a', I believe is better since it captures the 4 W stones more securely.]

(;B[jk]C[RS: All the way to here from W132 (g10), B could have cut at k12 and it would still work instead of B252 (k9). This is also another reason why haneing twice from a 2-stone group is bad. Variation.]
