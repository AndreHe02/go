C[Hi and thanks for reviewing my game. I played black in this game and won by .5 but only because of a blunder by my opponent.  I am curious particularly about ways I could have taken greater control of the game in the fuseki.  I felt they were in charge for the most part though I was fighting.

-> Hi, sorry for my (hopefully not to) weird eng. :) I hope my review helps you to improve although i'm not able to comment every move. :)]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[nc]C[This is a move I have been playing for some time now.  If given the chance I will often play the shimari in the lower right in the same way before a move on the other side.  If you have any comments on this choice I would appreciate them.

-> there is nothing wrong with it; although i prefer to decide where to fight next :)]
;W[pi]C[This seems to be among the better responses to my strategy.  Especially this move I felt it difficult to reply to because it is close enough to my shimari to feel like  it's preventing my expansion potential but also seems far enough away to be difficult to attack.

-> there is nothing to worry about your upper stones. In fact you could use them to drive the wite stone into.]

(;B[pg]C[Too small. There is no need to defend.]
(;W[kc];B[qn]LB[dj:A][do:B]C[Too small. White dont need to defend Q11 and can tenuki -> building some Mojo at A. How about attacking at B?]

Its better to append after a crosscut. There is no way to live for white then.]

(;B[lq]LB[kp:A][kq:B][lr:C]C[This seemed to me too big to just let go especially as I had already sacrificed up on the upper right on top of playing a losing joseki.  On the other hand I felt pretty guilty playing that empty triangle.  What do you think?

-> there is no need to play an empty triangle. 
In fact it doesnt look nice and C can be played in sente by w now. How about A or B?]
;W[lr];B[kq];W[gq];B[hr];W[sg];B[fn]LB[sj:A]C[Bad move. Doesn't attack, gives only few points, not needed to defend. 

I think A is urgend now. Even if you can connect the right group to something else w will get much profit pushing you arround. 

Also its easier to operate from a living base :)];W[qk];B[qj]
;W[sj]
(;B[sk]LB[rj:A][sm:B]C[no!!

keep that stone for something else. 

w can't cut at A and you won't get a 2nd eye with B.

As W must answer at B its no disaster but at last a waste of ko threads.]
;W[sm];B[ej]LB[mj:B][oj:A]C[good move but if you loose you group at A, you will loose the game. So it should be your priority to connect or get a 2nd eye.]

;W[bl];B[bm];W[co];B[bk];W[dp];B[hl]LB[il:A][jl:B]C[There is much influence for black and white is very weak. So A is better. Even B might work well.]
;W[hi];B[hk]LB[ki:C][fl:A][hl:B]C[no.

The connection between A and B is save without that stone.

How about trying to catch all stones !? ... it may fail, but at last you can connect your right group that is still missing an eye.]

;W[bn];B[bc];W[cc]C[This seems like a goof on white's part.  I expected them to play C16 and then I would play D18 even though I didn't expect it to come to much.

Even C17 might work as there is much room for 2 eyes for w.]

;B[en];W[dn];B[es]C[Ok. ill stop the review here, as there are no bad mistakes for black any more.

There are 2 major ( one minor ) points i see where you can improve.

1. keep always track of the status of every group. Even if there are huge points on the bord, play urgent stones first. Also a life-giving-stone turns a weak group into a strong one. A strong group is a exelent base to give your opponend some headache; so a urgent stone mostly is a big point in some other context on the board.

2. you sure know those nice "black to kill/live" problems from go-magazines etc. There is one thing about these you should remember. They may appear often on the board; but on most situations on the board there is more than _one_ way to attack or defend. Even if you found a move that works well in your situation; there still may be a better one that makes the same plus something else.

3. learn how to handle a crosscut :)];W[gr];B[gs];W[ds];B[dr]
