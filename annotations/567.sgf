Hamlet program
Have beaten Hamlet on 2 stones only once and previous best beat on 4 stones was by 7 points.
Turned out well, but I would like some advice on how to handle Whites invasion into the top right moyo, W169.

Thankyou for your time.];B[qf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[oc];W[jd];B[ne]C[

I think this move should be at o16 because it puts more pressure on white...]
;W[re];B[qe];W[rd];B[rf];W[nd]C[

... and the actual played move leaves white this opportunity.]

(;B[oe];W[nq];B[qm];W[cn];B[fq];W[dj];B[cg]C[

You play a lot of knight-moves (oogeima?)! Especially at the right I'd play at q7 instead of r7 since this harmonizes better with the wall above.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[

I think you are making those kinds of moves (oogeimas) because you fear to loose the corners.
In fact loosing a corner is big but if you can make up with territory created at the outside, why not let the opponent have a small corner? This is especially true with the right side, again.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er];B[eq];W[dr];B[dq]C[


This is too solid. Playing black I'd attack the lone white stone to the right or try to put the two white stones above in trouble.]
;W[dn];B[jq];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[

Right. Or - well - if you'd like to see the right side turning into your territory you should perhaps block on the other side...!?
There is surely less territory for black on the left side than above since white's stone at E2.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qp];B[qr]C[


I think it is better to go upwards with Q5 here...];W[po];B[ps]
;W[rr];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr]C[

"Don't crawl along the second line!" Better cut at R5 perhaps. Anyways your prospects around q10 have vanished now.]
;W[qn];B[qk];W[pm];B[pl];W[rm];B[ql];W[om];B[gc];W[sb];B[rl]

Endgame-move. Nothing much happens for white if black'd capture the S7 stone (would even be gote!). White making the monkey-jump would be big though currently it is not the right time. You are loosing sente that way!]
;W[eb]C[


Again: the corners! Don't be too greedy taking the corners. Why not attacking white's stones to the right?]

(;B[cb];W[ed];B[ec]C[

you cannot help loosing your lone stone. Better build strength with your left group now for messing up the right side later on...]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[fb];W[fd];B[hc];W[gb];B[db]C[


Play somewhere else. Leave the situation here open!];W[fa];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[ic]
(;B[hd]TR[lc][nc][nd]C[


White gives you the chance to get those stones! You cannot escape with the stones you are moving here without much damage. Better play on the other side!]

;W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[ef];W[de];B[ce]C[


so what should one say here "congrats for saving this former three stones by adding 5 more and letting white make a wall!" ?
What I want to say is you better sacrificed those three stones around H16 earlier since they cost you too much. (BTW You didn't make any territory with them but helped white getting some influence through the wall he was able to build while chasing you.)]
;W[ke];B[lf]TR[md][me]C[


So playing N16 at N15 would have been better, saving you one move here!?]

F10 or somewhere around G9 would be better pincering the white group between black stones to the right and left side.]
;W[hi];B[fj];W[em];B[gk];W[ik]C[


If I were white by now I'd fear about my group to the left. Very well done separating the two groups!]

Better play M13 for example... ;-) or maybe F2.];W[ek];B[am]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[gr];B[fr];W[fs];B[hr];W[bs];B[gq];W[al];B[an]

Endgame-move. There are still much bigger points on the board to be played!]
;W[hj];B[ll];W[kl];B[ln];W[mm];B[mk];W[kh];B[lh]C[


still, M13 is more solid.];W[op];B[oq]C[


this move is not really necessary since this group is connected and alive. So in the end your move is worth one point (Q2). There should be a move of that value left on the board somewhere...]
;W[oo]C[



...though it is sente with some points.];B[mp];W[np];B[ol];W[gn]
;B[hn];W[sf];B[sg];W[qh]C[The invasion, how should I respond to this?



How about capturing to start positive? ;-)]

C[

Not really necessary and bad shape. How about playing at M13 instead if you want to play up there?]
;W[jh];B[ck]C[


Ok, this one takes one point from white's scoring and creates big gote for you later on.
If you already was unsure about your territory on top right a move like S11 for example would help you relaxe.]
;W[dk];B[jl];W[gi];B[fi]C[


right, there is a possibility to put this white group under pressure or even kill it. Now, does the move you played distroy eyespace? No, it doesn't since white still can play at F12.
Efficiency is very important in Go as you should have noticed by now (see this M14-thing earlier).

How about playing F12 yourself? But very likely this white group will live.]
;W[aj]C[I missed this move, cost me a few points.];B[ah];W[ak]
;B[nm];W[jk];B[il];W[nn];B[nl];W[ri];B[qj]C[A threat to cut.  Trying to make his thick without eyes.  He was trying for a seki?


I don't know. A seki? Seems hard to get here. Maybe hoping for a mistake by you?
After browsing through the rest of the record I have to admit: "Well, a seki, oh, looks reasonable." ;-)]
;W[qi];B[ki]C[


This is not a good move since white can put this one in atari or something with his next move. Better not play it.]
;W[lj]C[I was trying to make eyes, but every effot failed.  Can you show me how I could have secured life?




I hope I could give you some ideas with the "fictions" I added later.]
;B[li];W[oh]
(;B[oi]C[

Too close to white! Better play farer away to not give him strength by touching his stones!

Now that I've gone through the record it comes to my mind that particularly this stone will be one cause of your downfall later on!]
;W[pj]

It would be better to play so as to put pressure on white.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[nh];B[pf]C[


perhaps P14 makes better shape?];W[rj]

In such situations do not go for making your borders secure but go for creating eyespace!]
;W[nf];B[mf]C[False eye, but a start


right ;-)];W[ng];B[of];W[ok]C[

I think you mustn't tenuki here (see later comments).

I think this is the most important point of the game.]
(;B[kj];W[lk];B[jj];W[ni]C[


I think it is a big mistake to let white play here (he gets one eye for sure). You should have played P10 instead of L10 two moves earlier (see variation for move 220)]

(;B[pg]C[


Actually I think you should focus on one way to achieve your goal. But you should be able to dynamically change according to the situation.
Here you play to the left with your K10 and then you suddenly start playing inside with Q13 again.
You already have seen what would happen to the white group to the left if you had persuaded your path till the end...]

It is not necessary to kill that way. You are just giving away points...]

No, it is alive. White couldn't block on C1 and actually had to play A2 though.]

Congratulations!
One important point I'd like to repeat here is to not play moves just because they are sente! E.g. R16 is one of those moves.

Now that you secured your group and killed the white stones around here, this is "almost" sente against the white group to the right. So white will have to make one further move to secure it and some territory.]

CGoban's score-estimation thinks that black is leading by 35 points now.
Therefore black could let the white center-group live with no problems.]

one has, of course, to consider this, too. This is not that simple though.]

This I'd guess is also to consider. But still black is likely to win the capturing-race.

actually black's stone at R7 is now bit too close to the wall at the buttom. But anyways this gives white some strange feeling.]

(;B[me];W[oe];B[of];W[od];B[pf]C[

Looks better than the actual sequence to me because of the following reasons:
- builds a nice wall towards the buttom.
- white will have to play once more into the area at the top if he does not want to get into trouble with this stones later on.
=> after white defends black can extend from his wall!]))
