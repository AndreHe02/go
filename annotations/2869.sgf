C[Hello, my name is drakelord, and I'll be reviewing your game for you today.  

If you have any further questions, or would like some tutoring, you can contact me on msn with drakelord_nK@hotmail.com or by email at drakelord@unbounded-world.net]
;B[jj];W[dd];B[cj];W[jc];B[kg]LB[gc:C][ke:A][cf:B][ek:F]C[Alright, we will start here.  This move is too small, so lets try to adjust.  *labels some varations*

These would be better spots, because the side play at l7 just pushes yourself in.]
;W[hk]
(;B[gj]LB[fk:A][ik:B]C[Alright, here, white has made a successful attack, and chances are, this formation will not die.  So, what would be better would be to limit it.]
;W[hj];B[ik];W[hi];B[cf]LB[gk:A]C[Ok, right now, we need to close off the other formation before we worry about gaining more.]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[ce];B[bf];W[fj];B[ej];W[be]
(;B[dg]LB[ef:A][fh:1][fi:B]TR[gc]C[Here, there was no need to play to the inside, instead, push more towards the outside and expand yourself.  Or, make it so he has to capture your other piece, then follow up by playing 1.

But, what would be more important right now is getting a foot hold in his back.  With just one more move, he can seal it off, and keep all of that territory to himself.  The triangle would have been the good invasion point.]
;W[gd];B[ek];W[gi];B[gh];W[il];B[jl];W[gl];B[fm]LB[ee:B][ke:A]
C[F1 wasn't needed yet.  instead, you can play at some area for more points.]
;W[ke];B[lf];W[le];B[jh];W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[bg];W[gf];B[if]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[fh];B[ij];W[mf];B[mg];W[me];B[lg]LB[hg:B][gh:A]
C[This was another time you could have played elsewhere.  Piece A is in trouble right now, and is in need of rescuing.  So a play at B would have been better.]
;W[ie];B[ch]LB[ee:B][hg:A]C[Again, another time you could have played somewhere else.]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[ig]

;B[kk];W[gm];B[df];W[ee];B[fg];W[gg];B[dh];W[ff];B[kc]LB[ec:A]
C[At this point, it would be reallllly hard to invade, but if you were going to be risky, and try it anyway, I'd probably try it at A.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[ib];B[lb];W[ja];B[ld];W[kd];B[md];W[lc];B[dc]
;W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[da];W[ea];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[ab]LB[bd:A]
C[Here, the computer made a mistake.  You probably didn't see it, but if you play B10, the formation can live.  Either you will end up killing his entire back formation, or you will just live in the corner.  I made different varations of what could happen, just look through them.]

(;B[ba];W[cd];B[aa];W[ac];B[li];W[kf];B[bl];W[de];B[dk];W[ef]
;B[ll];W[tt]C[This move wasn't needed.  Everything is already secure, so there is no need to take away your own points.]

[al][cl][dl][el][kl][ml][am][bm][cm][dm][em][km][lm][mm]C[How is it that I end in this situation every time?

It seems that when it comes to the scoring, I get killed by an minimum of 19 moku or more.

What the {censored} am I doing so terribly wrong?

----------------------------------------

Just to summarize, try not to close yourself in, and look out for good spots to attack.  If you need help, just contact me.]
