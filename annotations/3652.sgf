C[Game reviewed oct2005 by Allan Wickberg. Comments marked "al>".

al> Bear in mind that I am sort of 20-15k myself - a stronger player would probably correct some of my statements.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dd];B[qp];W[oc];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[md]
C[al> Up to this point, the opening looks fine, to me. The players appears,at least, to know what they are doing. W N16 here is the first deviation from what could be expected; it seems that it allows black to get an unnecessary large corner by playing Q17.]
;B[fq];W[fp]C[Yippie: Move 11-12 How should I react to wF4? the reaction I had led to a horrible result

al> I think the problem for black in this situation is a lack of strategy. B F3, which is a normal move, indicates that black wants to make territory along the bottom. For that purpose, B G4 would have been a natural answer to W F4.]

(;B[cq]C[al> With C3, however, black indicates the he wants the corner instead. Needless to say, black can't have both (unless white is much weaker as a player).]
;W[dq];B[cp]C[al> By this point, black have chosen to take the corner, and should therefore be willing to sacrifice the F3 stone in exhange. Black's trouble comes from wanting to save both groups. Look at the game as a negotiation for territory - you have to give something to get something. With even players, it is all about getting a little bit better result than the opponent at each exchange.]
;W[co]
(;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[es]C[al> E1 at B5 (standard move) would have settled the black group in the corner.]
;W[fs];B[fr]C[al> B F2 is a wasted stone, since white can fend it off so easily. Often, it might be a good thing to append a stone to make a two stone group before sacrificing both. The benefit of that approach is that it makes the opponent worry and maybe spend an extra move to assert the capture, giving you the chance to grab points elwhere on the board.

al> In this case, I feel that B G3 would have made white worry a lot more than B F2 will. In any case, B B5 is the urgent move, still.]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[kq]C[al> "Urgent before big"; it is more important to settle the black C2 group than extending from P3. Also, L3 should probably be at M3 to work better with the black stones in the lower right corner. Imagine white answering with N3. Furthermore, it is wise to approach the thickness white has (or will have once the black G2 group is captured) with caution - M3 first, then K3 if the opportunity should arise.]
;W[jq];B[cj]C[al> I think B L4 would have been appropriate before playing elswhere. There is nothing wrong with B C10 per se, but if we take into account how the game develops, B L4 would have given black a better thrust towards the center. The idea behind B C10 is good, though (I imagine) - break up white's potential territory along the left side.]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[bp];B[bq]C[Yippie: wB4 kind of made me lose this game should 29 have been played there or is it to early in the game for that kind of attack - I mean for me to make territory behind white ---
what is my greatest flaw in the opening?

al> Yes, #29 should have been at B5, as pointed out earlier. The black group in the corner is now dead.]
;W[ao];B[pc]C[al> And black has the sense to not try to save it - good!]
;W[nc];B[pj];W[pm];B[ql];W[qm];B[ko];W[mm];B[mn]C[al> I think the playing has been excellent, up to now. If B wants to capture the white stones, then contact play like with N6 is not a great idea ("don't touch what you intend to kill", or something). Also, it is often the case that the threat of capture is more profitable than the capture itself. This situation is a perfect example of how black can chase the white group out into the board, while staking out territory on both sides in the process. B O5 or O9 are possible moves to this effect. Approach from a distance, so that white cannot counter attack too easily, and make sure to deliniate new territory with each move.]
;W[ln]C[al> As seen here, contact play make it easy for the opponent to get away by counter attacking. Contact play inevitably strenghtens both players in that region. So, for survival, contact play is the right thing to do.]
;B[lo];W[nn];B[mo];W[kn];B[cc]C[al> B C17 seems to go in the wrong direction. Black has two corners, and should be aiming for presence in th center now. B F17, with the intent to run out into the board, would be better, for instance. I would probably have played E13, or why not K10, to work as a ladder breaker in order to cut at M7. Black should keep up the pressure on white's N7 stones as long as there is significant gain from it.]
;W[jo];B[jp]C[al> This sequence makes black heavy without gaining much in return. B K6 would be more interesting as it poses a better threat to white's stones.]
;W[ip];B[kp];W[in];B[ne]C[al> B O15 feels to small. B Q13 would be better for securing territory along the right side. B F17 would make a nice dent in white's potential territory along the top. B L17 would put pressure on the white group at the top. B K10 also looks really nice right now.]
;W[id]C[al> We can see that B O15 did not make much of territory for black, but rather hade the effect of inducing white to stake out the top.]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[ed];W[df]C[al> B E13 would have been nice to have in place here.]
;B[cf];W[de];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[dg];B[ch];W[dc];B[db];W[fd]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[pn]C[al> Again, contact play is not so good for attacking. If black had played P5 instead, it would have been both a greater threat (to cut), as well as a step to hinder white from poking into black's area by means of O5. Also, since it would not have been as easy to attack for white, black could have gotten the chance to play elsewhere earlier.]
;W[on];B[oo];W[qn];B[po];W[ee];B[eb];W[fa];B[cb]C[al> As far as I can read, B C18 is not urgent. Cutting at F15 would be more interesting at this point, even more if B K10 had been in place.]
;W[mi];B[oh]C[al> For the purpose of securing territory, I would play R13 instead of P12 (but that's me :) because of the amount of space P12 leaves open behind black's lines. More important, B K10 in order to get inside white's embroyic moyo in the center, feels like The Move right now.]
;W[me]C[al> B: about 84 pts, W: about 85 pts. (I better add a disclaimer for bad counting :)]

;W[lm]
(;B[nm];W[lk];B[kk];W[kj];B[ll];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[om]C[al> The white stones are cut off from the others, so P7 should not be necessary. It also creates an "empty triangle" which white can atari by O9. Consequently, O9 should be played by black instead.]
;W[hq];B[ir];W[hp];B[is]C[al> B J1 does not feel right. OK, it yields larger territory, but is easy to lose if not under constant watch. Because of the liberty at H1, the danger is not imminent, but it is too easy to forget, so I would have played K2 instead. B J1 is also gote, since it does not threaten white in any way.]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[ck];B[fg]C[Any general flaws in move 90-150?
I meant to reduce w in center - perhaps I should have aimed to strengthen my own existing territory - waited with my attack somewhere - I would like you general thought about the moves done

al> It was a significant reduction, and I have pointed out a few things along the way, but other than that it was fine, I would say. To figure out when to reduce, or to increase your own territory, it is necessary to have a reasonable sense of who is in the lead. When you are leading, try to increase your own territory; when you are behind, it is better economy to try and destroy the other guys territory.

al> If we look back to #90, or rather #86, before the reduction started, the game was pretty  even. However, since black had the side and corner moyos and white seemed to have more to gain in the center, it was logical for black to aim for a reduction. It is always easier to destroy territory in the center, rather than to build it.

al> At this point, W has about 85 pts, while black has about 100, thanks to the large bottom right corner. The reason white has about the same points as at #86 is that the reduction has taken away white's *potential* territory, which I did not count as real points.]
;W[ff];B[mg];W[lg];B[nk];W[nj];B[oj];W[hs];B[pb]C[al> oops - the black j1 group is unguarded now.]

;W[he];B[mr];W[lr];B[lq];W[ls];B[ms];W[qh]C[I'm really bad at countering moves like wR12 in what way should I reduce the chance for it to live?

al> white should really not be able to live here, but to be safer, stones like R13, as I pointed out earlier, is really nice to have in place at situations like this. The important thing is to not allow the invader enough room to make eyes, but not get too close until needed to not get into contact fighting, which generally favours the group that tries to make life.]
;B[qf]C[al> good, but s14 is better, to undercut white.];W[rf]
C[al> the best place to play is often the same for both players. since S14 is good for white, black should have played there first.]

any tips on what I need improve most at?

al> I think you should improve your reading, both for taking advantage of the opponents mistakes (I have pointed out a few of white's) as well as for making life, or capturing. One way is to do Go problems or play a lot of 9x9 games. Another is to review your games thoroughly afterwards. You can check out reviews of other's games at the GTL, as well - I do that a lot. Overall the playing is pretty decent for 22k. Good luck in the future!]
