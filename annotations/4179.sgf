Hi Lukasz,

I found this a hard game to review.  I hope you find the review helpful.  I disagree with four or five of your chuban moves and I imagine they would have been enough to win.  To pick a random example, I estimate C17 rather than H17 would have got you ten points in the corner rather than the three in the centre you finished with.

Score wise, I think S10 cost you more than anything else but I have included more commentary on the other points since I think they are likely to turn up in other games more often.

Strategy wise, I think you concentrated too much on moyo at the expense of territory.  Also, having concentrated on moyo it is very important to convert that moyo into attacks or territory extremly quickly, I think you were too willing to take gote.]
;B[pc]C[
teabing: I put some questions in the game. The most important for me is how shoul i have dealt with the invasion on the right side. I'd apreciate if someone told me what else I did wrong.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf]C[--
I would prefer to take the empty corner rather than play Q14.  If you look at a few professional games where Q14 is left out, you will see the cost to white is relatively minor.  However, if you play Q14 but not Q10 then the three white stones become somewhat heavy.]
;B[nc];W[pj]C[--
This is fine, but I'm not convinced it fits in with the strategy of taking Q15 before the empty corner.]
;B[dq]C[--
Odd, I had expected hoshi for some reason];W[cf]C[--
C5 also okay];B[ci];W[fc]C[--
C17 also okay];B[df];W[db]C[--
C17 probably better];B[ce];W[jp];B[dm];W[jj]C[teabing: I think that up to now it is even. Black has some secure teritory and white gained influence.
--
I would not have played tengen here, though I agree the game is about even.

My logic is this: When a game is heavily unbalanced between the territory and influence between the two players it is much harder to think about.  I find it easier to play when the territory and influence are roughly even.  So, I would have been looking at J17 and G3.

Still, K10 is a nice move.];B[qq]C[--
Big mistake by black];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq]
;B[pk]C[teabing: To me it looked unreasoneble but probably there was nothing better for black in this area. It turned out ok for black. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere?
--
Black made a big mistake invading at sansan before reducing the moyo.  Now black needs to do something creative.

White's job therefore is to keep the situation simple and generally make sabaki awkward for black.  White cannot prevent sabaki, but white can at least discourage it :)]
;W[rq]C[teabing: This looked like sente so I played this before dealing with Q9

It is sente];B[rr];W[rp];B[sr]
(;W[qk]LB[oj:B][qj:C][ok:A]C[teabing: Was this a mistake? A, B and C are other moves I considered here. I think that B or C could have won the game. Am i right?
--
I would have played B...  I think R9 is okay but allows black the crosscut that black will want.]
;B[pl]C[--
Q8 is heavy, black allows you to take P10];W[ql]C[--
wrong direction, there was only one eye this way anyway];B[pm]
C[--
Mistake by black again! P10 now and black is in real trouble]
;W[oj]C[--
Well, I disagree with several of your moves in that sequence, but I think you should be very happy now.]

C[teabing: I think that up to now it looks ok, but i should have stoped trying to kill black here (In fact at this moment i already thought that this was imposible) and use the influence of the marked stones to invade the left side or maybe play at A for profit.
--
attacking black here is sente, so won't cost much];W[lo];B[ln]

I would tenuki now
J17, G3 are both still available];W[kn];B[kl];W[jl];B[kk];W[fq]
TR[nr]C[teabing: I'm not sure if this is the right direction. The other side is open so i need yet another move to make teritory there. Maybe I should invade on the other side?
--
Ithink F3 is a little far.  Black can respond at D5 and if white doesn't add another move there are easy invasions for black.]
;B[do];W[fo]C[--
This prevents the invasion but costs sente];B[kj];W[jd]LB[dl:A]
C[teabing: I wanted to dave a ladder breaker so I could play at A

I would prefer J16 since it threatens M17];B[lc];W[dl]C[--
K17 is extremely large too];B[cl];W[ck];B[cm];W[dk];B[ei]C[--
Good result for you.  Seems you can't quite tenuki and live so I guess you cannot K17]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fn];W[gn];B[ne]C[teabing: That was big. I see it now, but I didn't even consider it during the game.
--
it is big, but gote.  K17 is bigger];W[mr]C[teabing: This was big]
;B[hc]C[--
I would play C17];W[ps]C[teabing: I didn't read this carefuly
--
heh... It doesn't matter];B[pr];W[rs];B[qr];W[ns];B[qs];W[hd]
C[teabing: I think that this was the best move to deal with the situation here. Is this correct?
--
It is hard to say.  My feeling is that K16 can escape easily and with C17 open I would choose points instead of connecting]
