===================================

Hello,

I find this game is characteristic of many of my matches.

I find it difficult to play vs. opponents who are very aggressive attackers.

E.g. the attach - hane - attach types.

My defense seems weak, and even if I am successful in getting life, I am split into several small groups and have yielded much of the board.

I welcome comments and suggestions, not just about specific tactical points, but also regardng ways to generally improve my play in these sorts of situations.

Thank you very much for sharing your time and experience.

;W[dd]C[Reviewer :

It is very good for you to have reviewed and tried to learn by yourself. Consider doing this for each game you submit for review.

I can see you master some tactic materials. However, this is precisely what killed you, because it burdens you, and keep you focused on small points.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[jj]C[This move seems a little ambitious to me. My reaction is to plan to stake out territory on the sides and not worry about the middle yet.

R : Sure, this does not make sense at at this stage];W[jd];B[lc]
;W[kc];B[dq]MA[ep][eq][fq]C[R : not usual. Joseki is on the marked places]
;W[cq]C[I try to defend the corner, and hope to attack from above.

R : Ok with me so far];B[dp];W[do]MA[nq][jp][qn][pj]C[R : i prefer somthing more agressive ... but this is not a mistake to me yet]
;B[jq]C[R : this is why I would have played at K4 before.];W[qn]
MA[pj]C[I don't want to give up all the right side, so I will try an approach and fall back to form a base if possible

R : there is not "giving up" at this stage of playing (to my understanding of Go), but rather an orientation of the trades you want to make on the sides ...

Is this a suitable play?

R : ok with me

Would one of the star points have been better?

R : I don't have the star points on my viewer ... Q10 would be ok]
;B[ro]MA[qo]C[Black usually defend at R5]
(;W[pk]C[Beware of letting a black stone invade from downards your side ... S5 stone could sneak in your right side later

I prefer either S6 or even R5];B[rn]C[Hmmm ? (I had not seen the move to make my previoous comment ...)]
;W[rm]C[Beside, this gives you a loose shape];B[qi];W[qj];B[ri]
;W[rj];B[ce];W[cd]C[Again, I want to defend my corner

R : There, the point is not really the corner, but which direction you want to give to the game I am ok with this.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[ef];W[dh]C[I need to frame out more territory on the left.

I'm trying to pressure black against my 3 stones at top.

But perhaps this approaches too closely.

Would C12 or D10 be better here?

R : You made a clever reading ... afterwards

There is a go saying : "play away from thickness"];B[bi]C[R : too low]

(;W[ch]C[You must think of what you want to achieve with this kind of moves ...

Attacking ? no chance to capture Territory ? there is none actually Influence ? not the good direction, and too close ...]
;B[bh];W[cj];B[ci];W[di];B[bj];W[ck]C[So far, this is very good for white ... B is helping W building thickness toward center, and getting peanuts on the side]
;B[bk];W[bl]C[Black runs further down into the bottom half than I like.

R : you read my mind ... but beware of weaknesses]
(;B[cg];W[dg];B[cf];W[df]C[Trying to prevent black from connecting the group on left with the center.

R : OK, but this might reveal not only being overplay, but possibly a mistake, because K10 stonne is helping E14, and B may build on E14 toward centre]
;B[de];W[ee]C[Pushes to cut black off];B[fe];W[ed];B[ff];W[fg]
MA[fh][nq][fr][ld]C[Now I would like to add some depth towards the center for this group.

I get a few stones out, but overall I think the shape is a little flat.

R : flatness here is not really the point, though I understand what you mean. The thing is : Go player think in terms of "big" and "small" This is small because it does not help very much territory nor influence

Should I be helping this group?

R : This group does not yet need help. Rather chase bigger points down the board ...

Or would a play elsewhere make more sense?

R : If you wanted to stick with this group, rather play F13, less prone to black attacks Otherwise, get where points are ...]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[gg];W[fh];B[fd];W[fc];B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[jf]
MA[id]C[Also hoping to squeeze black into a small space left of this wall

R : Yes, but are YOU building anything ? you still have a weakness I would rather be cautious and defend at J16]

(;B[jg];W[kg];B[jh]
(;W[lf]C[Trying to protect against the cut and get more shape

R : There was no need protecting against the cut there ...]
;B[ld];W[le]MA[kh][pi][nf]C[Same comment : Territory ? nil Influence ? nil]
;B[kd];W[ic]C[Hoping to secure a connection to the territory on the upper edge]
;B[gc]
(;W[gb]C[This turns out to be a blunder.

Maybe E18 would have been better defense];B[ec];W[fb]C[Didn't want to lose the stone in atari]
;B[dc]C[This starts a capturing race that I lose

R : What race ? count the liberties ...]
(;W[cc]C[This pressures black, but does not give me much leeway

R : Yes it does, count the liberties ... (btw, look at this shape : B D17-E17 embedded in W stones, and remember it ...)

Perhaps one of the variations would have been better?

R : I admit I have not browsed all variations, because of the very simple W answer]
;B[ad]
(;W[ac]C[???????????? (easy to say afterwards ...)];B[ae];W[bb]
C[This is the final error.

Black gets sente and I can't escape

R : Well ... yes D18 was the only move];B[cb];W[bc];B[ba];W[hd]
C[I finally admitted that the group is dead and look for somewhere else to play.

I was intending to try to split the (emerging) group in the corner from the stones at J14-15.

However, in hindsight, this move seems very small.

R : Yes

Would H10 or F5 or M9 or P6 been better?

R : Probably ...

Or some other move?

R : O3, also Also, G16 ... B cannot defend G17];B[id];W[hc]
;B[he]
(;W[gf]C[Should have played at G15.

This would have assured connection to the stones above.];B[ge]
;W[gd];B[hg];W[jl]C[Okay, I've lost the upper left corner, but I hope that I have some strength in the middle left, middle right and upper middle.

R : Hmmm ... and what about B ?

My plan is to try to either connect left and right,

R : Hmmmm ... why ? where is the territorial thought behind this ?

or if black tries to prevent, then build territory up and down to either side.

The next 30 moves or so illustrate a frequent problem for me: I slide on the defensive, give up sente and get backed into a tiny area.

How can I prevent this?

R : play (often) :-)

Okay, enough teasing. The game is lost at this stage, not because what you think (next 30 moves), but purely by reading the board and your mind ...

You assume bottom side is Black, for instance ! now, just count on corners and sides what B has got in term of potential territory, and w has in counterpart. You can also count this assuming you had not lost the upper left corner ...

See what I mean ?];B[li];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[jn]C[Ouch !];W[km]
C[Is a shoulder hit here a good response?

Would a 1 point step to M8 or H8 been better?

(1 point steps seem too lose in this situation)

R : unfortunately, this is not the point ... A good response to what ? and for which purpose ? Just Tenuki (ignore), and attack elsewhere]
;B[jm];W[kk]C[Hoping to maintain some depth and strength to one side

R : OK, but I prefer L6];B[jk];W[il]C[Push through black and keep top and bottom separate]
;B[ik];W[gl]C[Reach out toward my other stones - try to gain some space from black.]
;B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[fj];B[gh];W[ki]MA[ep]C[I figure I can join up either up or down with this move and isolate the two stones to the right.

Where would have been a stronger play at this point?

R : Think Global (whole board). B will not change the face of the game from those two M11 stones However, there are many worth points for YOUR territories, which can change the whole board. Just figure out the difference in the game direction if B plays E5 or W play it first ...

Since the bottom remains quite virgin yet, a few attacks are still valid (already mentionned earlier)]
;B[kj];W[lj]C[I chickened out, though and got concerned about the stone at L9.

However, this play did *nothing* to save it, in fact, black could double atari at M9 (but does not)]
;B[kh]C[So now L11 is wasted.];W[lh];B[ji];W[mj]C[Try to force black to play at L11.

N10 gives me more thickness along black, then I can reinforce below]
;B[ki];W[ll]C[Protect the weak cutting spots.];B[nk];W[oj]C[I want to make sure that upper middle group stays connected.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[nj];W[oh];B[pi];W[oi];B[pj]
(;W[ql]C[Perhaps P7 or O7 a better play?

R : Probably. The only threat would be T10];B[nm];W[nl]C[Hmmm ...]
;B[ml];W[ol];B[lm];W[mm]C[Another big blunder.

I completely missed the fact that L9-N10 group is in atari.

Moreover, I'm still mystified why I even thought playing into atari was a good move.

What was I thinking?!];B[kl];W[in]C[Better to cut my losses.

I thought hard about playing L6 and hoping to cut off the 2 black stones, but it seemed too risky.

I am hoping to consolidate a pocket around E7, F6.

But this gets punctured and the bubble collapses.

In this situation, is it better to play a direct attachment like this?

R: I have few knowledge of the "direct attachement" What I see is J8 group being attacked soon to the detriment of J8 stone Each time you "attach",you lose a liberty

Or would it be better to step away from black and play H6 or F5?

R : to me, yes]
(;B[kn]C[black chickens. He could make things really bad]
(;W[jo]C[Here again, you stick to your diagonal shape, instead of creating safety and thickness This remains weak, and will probably cause you some trouble

Here again, attaching agaisnt a black group is not something you really want to do]

Black wins handily.

I made some major errors: Losing the upper left corner, losing my group at M9, allowing black to penetrate so far in the lower left.

Still, even without those, I feel like I was simply outplayed.

Black's attacks just kept forcing me to respond defensively and I never regain sente for more than a play or two.

Any suggestions or general remarks?

R : Okay :

1) Don't think "tactics". That is what killed you, because you kept focused on a few stones here and there, and not on the whole board

(see comment at stone 209) For instance, sente is not really needed to be mastered until you reach 13k or so on IGS.

2) Look again at what happened when you attached played a stone alone, attached to a black stone ... And don't do it again ... unless you have very good reasons

3) More generally, you should be thicker in your defenses what happened in the middle of the board is an example. Don't use too much of diagonal stones, and prefer adjacent

Any recommended reading, resources or practice?

Readings ? I don't know.

Resource : Sure, get revied games at the GTL, of players around 15 k or so

Practice :play.

Thank you for your input.

R : Hope this helps
