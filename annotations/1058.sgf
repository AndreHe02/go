RE[B+1.5]

C[Hello,

my name is Peter Strempel, I am somewhat around 7k in Germany, playing as 11k on IGS.
You did not comment your game, so I will try to identify the questionable positions.
Although you are german, too, I write this review for the GTL in english.]
;B[pp]TR[oe][pd][pe][qc][qd][qe]C[It is more usual to start in the top right corner for black.
Not too important, but it is sort of polite.];W[dd];B[dp];W[pc]
TR[qd]LB[qe:A]C[This is questionable, as black should now approach the 4-3 stone at (A) with
backup from his lower right 4-4 stone. More common would be to play Q17 at R16
instead, so a black approach would face the upper left white corner.]
;B[cf]TR[qe]C[Black should approach the 4-3 stone instead. If white gets to play the corner enclosure
(shimari) at R15, this will be a strong position for white.]
;W[fd]C[Ok.];B[bd]
(;W[bc]C[This move is a mistake. C17 is normal. I give a variation.]
;B[ci]C[Black ignores your mistake. He could now take the corner with C17.]
;W[cd]C[This is bad, white has to add another move here now. If you compare with the first variation,
White had sente to play K17 or R15. Now white ends with gote, as black can ignore this move.]
;B[qe]C[Good move.]
(;W[od]LB[nd:A]C[Also a good move. But as you are strong in the upper left corner, you could
extend a bit more here to (A). See variation.];B[of]TR[qh]C[Questionable. Black should extend on the side. The white position is very strong.]
;W[jc]C[Ok. But you invest too many stones on the top side. You could take your chance
now and invade the bottom. If black invades the top now at K17, he will play between
two strong white positions, so white should get  no bad result.]
;B[qj];W[pn]TR[fq][nq]C[This is a mistake.
Approach from the open side.
If black answers your move properly, white gets no good result.]

(;B[pl]C[This is too aggressive from Black. He should play as in the variation.]

(;W[qp];B[qq];W[po]TR[qo]C[Normally you extend to R5. But as black as a strong position above your stones,
white gets cramped. This makes your original R4 questionable.]
;B[qo];W[rp];B[ro];W[pq];B[op];W[rq];B[qr];W[pr]
(;B[rm]TR[rr]C[Why didn't black just capture the corner?];W[rr]
;B[nn];W[om];B[ml];W[nl]TR[ol]C[Just extending to P8 is enough. Question is, should you rescue those stones at the moment.
Lower left corner offers bigger plays for now.];B[ol];W[nm]

(;W[fs]C[Not necassary. Lets see what happens if you dont capture now.]
;B[je]C[Good move by black. Keeps white top in check.]
(;W[ke]MA[hd][ld]C[Possible response, tho keep the knights move to the side in mind, usually a good
response.];B[kf]

Instead, K16 is a big point.];B[bk];W[al];B[ao];W[di];B[dh]

;B[id];W[ic];B[he];W[ge];B[jf];W[hf]TR[me]C[N15 is big. If black gets to play there, he can indent the top. Also whites shape is
somewhat odd with the cutting point at H17.]

;B[tt];W[as];B[ap];W[fh];B[dg]C[Record ends here. Close game. Both players made many mistakes. But this is fine, doing mistakes
helps to learn the game.

Some general remarks:

Try to look for your own weak points. Those are the most important moves to play.
If you have a weakness, you need to protect it, else your opponent will strike there.

Next best moves are moves that strike at the weakness of your opponent. And if you can build up
own territory while erasing the opponents territory, this is even better.

Moves that connect your groups and split the opponent groups are very valuable. Remember,
connected groups are strong, split groups are weak. Strong groups won't be attacked, but you
can yourself launch an attack from that group. Weak groups are usually prey for the opponent
and hardly make territory. You don't need to kill a group, if you can wall it in and limit to a
couple of points, this is enough as a success.

Moves that simply make territory for yourself but dont apply pressure on your opponent
are usually big, but if you have one of the above moves, prefer those.

Do not give every atari you spot on the board. Too many ataris spoil your game, especially if
after a sequence of three ataris you suddenly notice you didn't gain anything at all. Read ahead some moves. I know this is difficult, wish I could do it myself. :)

Try to learn some of the standard patterns in the corner. I see you already know some. It's not worth
to remember too many by heart at your level, but the most common ones should be in your repertoire.

Keep playing, and look at your games afterwards, trying to identify your mistakes. We kyu players  do heaps of mistakes all the time, the important thing is to notice them. Doing the mistakes by itself
is not the problem. And keep sending games to the GTL. It helps a lot. I should do it more myself as
well.

If you have further questions, don't hesitate to contact me. You find me as "Zotan" on IGS and KGS.
I hope the review can help you a little to learn.
