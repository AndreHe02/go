C[Jaydee [20k\]: hi

Hi.  My name is Tim, and I'm reviewing your game.  I'm 9k on KGS, and I play as MatCauthon.  Most of my comments will have variations nearby, so make sure you check them out.  I'm not going to say "see variation" every time I make a comment.]
;B[oq]C[Zhora [19k?\]: hi];W[qd];B[dp];W[dd]
(;B[jd]C[It may be easier to approach the stone to the right than to play here.  It would also be easier if you played on the third line - then you can make a base easily.]
;W[hd]
(;B[nd]C[This is too far - your opponent is strong here.  See variation.]

(;W[ip];B[qo]C[This is kind of strange.  Q5 would be much better.  Here I think it's too easy for White if he plays Q4.]
;W[cm]C[At this point, you need to be thinking about White's framework already.  You might even jump in now, rather than protecting the corner.  White's stones aren't that close to your corner, so you shouldn't get into too much trouble.]
;B[fq];W[ej];B[kp]C[Good!  Attacking while making territory.]
;W[in]
(;B[iq]C[Not that good.  Better to make a big framework.]
(;W[hq];B[hr]C[BAD!  See variation.]

(;B[br];W[ao]
(;B[ar]C[This is too small to play this early.  Play a big move - it's time to do something about that framework.  You have several good moves.  You could make a framework of your own, or see vars.]
;W[ap];B[an]C[This doesn't do anything useful.  Don't play atari just because you can.]
;W[bo]
(;B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[hn]C[This forces White to make good shape.  See var.]

(;B[cc]C[Please help me.  Whenever I invade at the 3-3 point I end up dead.  Whenever I am invaded at the 3-3, they live.  I don't know how to be successful at this or stop it in my territory.  Where is a good place to learn more about this particular invasion?  People show me interesting things, but I canâ€™t seem to develop them properly.

First of all, your other group is not alive yet.  You can't do this now.  Second, you gave white a wall facing the corner, and then invaded at the 3-3 point.  That's not a good idea.]

When you want to kill stones, you shouldn't play against them - your stones should not touch theirs.  See var.]

If you had played the move to live in the upper left, it would have been a close game - that's worth at least 22 points.  If you don't let White push you around in the lower right, that's worth about 9.  I see two problems - you don't always play the biggest points first (neither do I :), and you left an unstable group alone for most of the game.
