C[I played black in this game.  It was my first 19x19 game.   I tried alot of things, some worked, some didn't.  If you could answer the questions I've inserted plus offer any insite to bad (or good) moves that I made that I may not have commented on.

I had a hard time fighting in the corners, but because of the passivity of my opponent, I was able to generate a large enough territory so this didn't hurt me.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

*Overall this game was well played.

I have answered all your questions as best I can, but If you need any clarification, feel free to send me a message.]

(;B[di]C[Here I start an attack because my opponent is content not to attack me.  I ultimately lose many points in this area.  Please critique what I did and offer any suggestions for a more successful invasion.

*Firstly, you need to start lower.  You don't have any supporting stones here, so you need to try to establish a base against the side.  It is possible to live (see the multitudinous variations).  It is little different than the begginning to make a live group here, as long as you play closer (but not to close) to the edge.]
