C[Hello, I'm kokorini. lets see the game
any questions feel free please.];B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[pe]
;W[op];B[mq];W[qq];B[pp];W[pq];B[qm]C[vernon: Here, I do not know the proper joseki, and because I feared the capping of the two stones, I moved where I thought I guaranteed life.

Kokorini: mmhh.... I dont think so. see next move];W[cn]C[Kokorini: look variation]

(;B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[cj];W[gd]C[vernon: Standard joseki for both.

Kokorini: Yes, but I feel it a little pullback for black];B[jd]
C[vernon: I know that the triangle Q15, Q17 and K16 are considered a perfect extension, though I am not skilled enough to understand why. However, in this instance, K16 is probably too close to W's thickness at D16.

Kokorini: Yes, more exactly is too near to G16 leaving too much room around N16.
probably M16 or L16 are better.
Anyway downside looks more urgent.];W[pl]C[Kokorini: the fact of place more stones ont right side will make more and more urgent to play on the down side]
;B[pj]C[vernon: I was perhaps mistaken in thinking that my Q4 group was thick. I wanted to drive Q8 into my Q4 thickness, which causes me to lose Q4.

Kokorini: thing that probably not happend if you have play before P5, witch is sente.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[qk];B[pi];W[pm]C[vernon: the W encirclement of Q4 begins. B unwisely has driven W onto his own weak group.]
;B[qn];W[rq]C[Kokorini: P4!!];B[rp];W[rl];B[rm];W[po]C[vernon: At this point, I am claustrophobic and need to bust out of here.

Kokorini: when you make a force at Q11 facing up was becouse / thanks-to / giving white a force facing down, so:
you have to think in you opponent stones result to.];B[ql]C[vernon: a double attack on Q9 and S9.]

(;W[rj];B[pk]
(;W[qo]MA[ri]C[vernon: I think this is a mistake. W needs to save R10 group. Perhaps S11 is better.]
;B[ri]C[vernon: In addition to the saving of R7, this makes a wonderful upper right corner.

Kokorini: thats right];W[pn];B[sj];W[rn];B[rk]C[vernon: Right now, W is not doing well.

Kokorini: not really];W[ro]C[vernon: While this is needed to save the lower right corner, it gives B a crucial sente. W was thick in lower right, and he could have used it to drive N3 into the thickness and make territory (possibly). But then B saves Q4.

Kokorini: becouse you are right about the crucial sente, If I was white, I do not play s5. I play for example J3
S5 is about 14 points, not too much at this stage of the game.]
;B[jq]C[vernon: The absolutely most conservative way to keep N3 alive in the shadow of W's thick position.

Kokorini: good];W[ld]C[Kokorini: now white have to compensate somehow the strategical lost on the right]

(;B[nd]MA[ke]C[vernon: This is probably wrong. Q15 is thick, and B should drive M16 into it. However, I used the idea of Attack and Defense that you want to induce your opponent to force you to make a move that you wanted to make anyway. I wanted to make K14 anyway, and O16 induces M14 which then forces K14. It is very risky, though, as I am encouraging W to drive K16 into his thickness. It worked out, but it probably shouldn't have. Probably better is L15 to drive M16.

Kokorini: Yes, I like much more L15. The point here is: why you want to play K14? is ok, but becouse you  walk  making territory on the right.... but.... wait! that is allready yours! so.....
what if first you make base with K16?];W[lf]MA[ke]C[vernon: probably better here is L15 to attack the K16 stone. This would drive K16 into W's thickness.]
;B[jf];W[lh];B[jh];W[eg]C[Kokorini: see? black group at K16 is begin attacked]
;B[dh]C[vernon: W cuts K16 from connecting to the left side at the cost of giving B territory.]
;W[lj];B[jj]C[vernon: Both have escaped into the center.

Kokorini: both without making territory or influence.];W[ll]
;B[nl]C[vernon: Here I was using the idea from the book Attack and Defense that you drive the weak group close to the another one, and then split them at the last minute. It did not work well, perhaps because both of W's groups need to be weak, and P4 is not weak. Also, my K16 line is weak. This drive and split strategy is dangerous for K16.]
;W[mn];B[lc]MA[mm]C[vernon: I get cold feet and decide to give K16 a base rather than cut M16 from its live allies. Perhaps I should have carried on with N7 to cut W's line from P3.

Kokorini: forget p3 cut, p3 dont cut with those 3 stones captured.
I like M17, after taking white base N7 is more important];W[mc]
;B[kd];W[md];B[kb]C[vernon: This gives eye space, but strengthens W.

Kokorini: well... you have to give something to your opponent]
;W[ne];B[od]C[Kokorini: O17 better];W[ok]C[vernon: I had already given up on splitting M16, so this did not bother me. I felt the territory at the lower left was much bigger.]
;B[gq]C[Kokorini: nice!];W[dl];B[ej];W[jo];B[go]C[vernon: all four B groups are alive, I believe, so B's strategy is a matter of reducing any center territory for W.

Kokorini: Mmhh... I likeG18 or around there];W[kq]C[vernon: W also embarks on a strategy of reduction.]
;B[kr];W[iq]C[Kokorini: looks like an overplay];B[ir];W[ip]
;B[hr];W[lq];B[lr];W[lo]
(;B[hc]C[vernon: B shores up a second eye on the upper side, but at the cost of strengthening W's upper left corner in gote.

Kokorini: see var];W[gc];B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[fl];B[gm];W[gl]
;B[en];W[do];B[jl]SQ[fa][bl][er][or]C[vernon: Again, simply reducing center territory.

Kokorini: bigger sente moves: B8, F19
  bigger but not so much: P2, E2];W[hm];B[hn];W[im]C[vernon: W is intent upon cutting the two live groups. B is unconcerned.

Kokorini:ok];B[hj];W[hg];B[gh];W[gg];B[eh];W[hh];B[hi]C[vernon: I want to preserve the connection between K10 and C10 in case the K line breaks. W at H12 now makes the line breakable.]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[fh];B[fi]C[vernon: K10 is still connected.];W[bd]
;B[be];W[rd]C[Kokorini:MMMhH?????

time tesuji perhaps?];B[qd];W[ni];B[og];W[ng];B[nf]C[vernon: bad move for B.
Kokorini:yes];W[of];B[pf];W[mf];B[oh];W[rc];B[re]C[Kokorini: no!  r18.... keep him away from the corner]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[se];B[rf];W[nb];B[ra];W[qa];B[pa];W[rb];B[sa]
C[vernon: the W attack is dead.];W[bl];B[eb]C[vernon: B mistakenly thinks he can attack.]
;W[fa];B[fc];W[ec];B[hd]C[Kokorini: at least you make H16 sente]
;W[ge];B[bk]C[vernon: Some territory in gote.];W[ck];B[dk];W[cl]
;B[bj];W[mp]C[vernon: B still gets to attack.];B[kp];W[lp];B[jp]
;W[ko];B[jr];W[in]C[Kokorini: useless move];B[or];W[pr];B[er]
C[vernon: Cheap territory grabbing.];W[dr];B[el]C[vernon: attack that loses a stone.]
;W[em];B[ek];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[ho]C[vernon: Fortunately there is the threat at J5 to keep sente.]
;W[io];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[lb];B[kc];W[he];B[ie];W[jg]C[vernon: I had long since stopped worrying about K10, because it is connected to C10 and cannot be killed by an attack along the K line.]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[kg];W[ji];B[ii];W[ki];B[km]C[vernon: I had been looking at this move for a while to puncture more territory.

Kokorini: A16, A8 are better];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[ms];W[jk]
;B[ik];W[kk];B[il];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[dp];W[cp];B[eo];W[dn]
;B[nj]C[vernon: a stone thrown in on a lark, which is useful later.]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[ol];B[nh]C[vernon: This was the point of 191, to gain the atari at O12. This begins a long sequence of B holding sente, which is unusual for me.]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[lg]C[vernon: W blocks an initial threat to N16.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[lm];W[mm];B[la];W[mb];B[ga];W[fd];B[kf];W[kh]
;B[jg];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[al];W[am];B[ak];W[bm];B[de];W[ee]
;B[bg];W[mq];B[ps]C[vernon: B miscalculates and loses this stone.]

;W[fk];B[fj];W[gm];B[gk];W[ke];B[je];W[gs];B[hs];W[fs];B[le]
C[vernon: B now rekindles the thought of threatening the N16 group.]
;W[gh];B[ke];W[me];B[ma];W[na];B[ka];W[kj];B[ij];W[os];B[oe]
;W[hf];B[nc];W[ob];B[oc];W[ps]C[vernon: the trap is ready to spring. The problem is that playing P19 is too obvious. W will defend with N10 and the threat to the whole of N16 is lost. The best that can be hoped is catching a couple of stones and saving O10. I calculate that this trap threat was worth 7 points.]
;B[mj]
(;W[nk]C[vernon: W saw the trap. See variation for what happens if the trap is sprung.]
;B[mk];W[ml];B[li];W[mi];B[ni];W[lk]C[Kokorini: ok for the tesuji.]
;B[ln]C[Kokorini:];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[if];W[li];B[oa];W[sb]
;B[sd];W[hq]C[vernon: Before komi, W wins by 5.

Kokorini: thats becouse, I think, you concentrate too much on doing book's things, witch I think is ok becouse the people who wrote the book plays incredible good, but... dont force situations to something readed.... just wait for the moment to use it. I hope you understand me.

anyway, here the first problem I think it was to not have profit from the chasing of  N15 group.
look: your territory on the right is the same before white invade upside.

well, I hope you feel my comments usefull.
