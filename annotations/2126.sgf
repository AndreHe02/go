C[*** Hi, my name is Josh I am 7 kyu on KGS. This was an interesting game. Black creates a lot of influence in the beginning rather than making explicit territory. This leads to white making a desperate invasion later in the game. I think this game is a excellent example of how influence should and should not be used.]

;B[ed]C[11- Was this move correct or should I have continued with the three stones on the right?

*** The main issue with the stones on the right is the weakness of the knights connection. It is possible for white to cut that connection later, so it may need to be reinforced. It would have been better to play the 1-space extension at O15. If you are prepared to deal with white makig that cut, then there is nothing wrong with E16.]
;W[df];B[id]C[*** A 3-space extension on the 4th line is very light. You cannot hope to gain much territory from this play. Furthermore, there is the weakness of G16 to bear in mind. If you want to claim ome territory along the side with this stone, placing it at H17 or J17 would be better.]
;W[kc];B[ke];W[kd];B[lg];W[gc];B[ql]C[At this point I did find that trying to rescue e16 was not a good idea...

*** Q8 is an interesting move. Clearly, it is going to make life difficult for white along the side, but you are leaving the corner open for invasion. This is not bad because an invasion there should lead to outside influence for black. Black is definitely playing an influence oriented game. However, you should bear in mind that that influence is only going to be useful if you can turn it into profit.]
;W[qq]C[*** The 3-3 invasion may not be wise given the overall situation. This invasion will result in a black wall facing towards the left. After that, blacks influence will become daunting...]
;B[pq]C[*** Avoid attaching to weak stones. P3 is better for black here.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qo];B[qn];W[rn];B[ro]C[*** Black is unlikely to kill white here so I would prefer R7 to make a strong wall with few defects. This also gives white a free stone...]

(;W[rp];B[rm];W[so];B[pn];W[dc]TR[cm][cn][jp][iq]C[*** This move is very small. Even if black manages to exploit the corner and make life for E16, it will be small and unimportant. There are much bigger points on the board. The marked positions are places that I think would be better.]
;B[jp]C[*** Good! Take a big point. Another idea is to play along the left side. The left side is easy territory for black or white, but the bottom side is hard for white. So, why not make life difficult for your opponent?]

;W[mf];B[mg];W[ne];B[lf]C[I now know this was a bad move because white cut me off from the two stones on the right ...

*** Yes. Black is too concerned about stopping white at all costs. Black attaches and plays atari at every opportunity - this is playing too close and gives white too much leverage.]
;W[of];B[me]C[*** This looks like an automatic response. Is black really evaluating what is happening on the board? Were those one or two points really that important?]
;W[md];B[og];W[pf];B[ld]C[*** This is a very small move. Playing on the left side is massive.]
;W[lc];B[pg];W[qf];B[pj];W[qi];B[pi];W[mp]C[*** This is an awful place to begin an invasion. The potential to make any territory (despite what happens in the game) is low. White should be looking to approach the stone at D4.]
;B[lq];W[mq];B[mn]C[Here is my big question;  This very bad move set white stone in movement and almost cost me what I tought would be an easy game.  This is not the first time that my opponent seems to be able to livee inside or escape on of my strong position...  Can you give me some advices on these situations (and of course this one)?

*** Firstly, don't try to kill everything on the board. Your goal should not be to kill all of your opponents groups. M3 is not a great move, but N6 is very good. It threatens whites life by making it hard to find eyespace, but even more than that it helps you to create territory in the centre at the same time! This is a better objective than trying to kill whites group - make territory while attacking.]

*** By playing J18 next, white ensures the life of the L17 stones. However, if white captures M18, black can start a ko. I am not sure that starting a ko is in blacks interests given the interesting situation on the bottom.]

*** Here is my advice for your next few games: 

(1) Think more carefully about attaching to your opponents stones. In general, attaching to stones makes them stronger. If you have a strong group and attach to a weak group, you are only helping your opponent. However, if you have a weak group, then attaching to a strong group can work in your favour. 

(2) If you are going to play an influence oriented game, expect your opponent to invade and try to reduce your influence. When they do that, you need to have some idea of how you are going to deal with the invasion, i.e., how you can profit by attacking their weak stones?]
