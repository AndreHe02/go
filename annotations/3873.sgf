DavidB [13k\]: Hi];B[dd];W[qg]C[I never know what to do when white plays an approach like this.  I think in the game, my choice was not best.]

(;B[md]C[I think your answer is possible too, but requires later to cover r17 invasion.]

(;B[jd]C[Here, is there a "best" location for an attack on this group?  Is black strong enough yet for this attack?
I was thinking to build centre influence and/or kill this group.  In hindsight, I think that statement shows that I'm still trying to do too much with my stones....  :P

Looking back at the game, I think this is a turning point.  Black is behind and must catch up.  White chooses to defend with K17 to this shoulder hit, then instead of building centre influence, black plays as if he can kill white, but white still can run.  Run right into the area that perhaps I should have been developing.

Also, in the fuseki, I'm thinking I played it too slack, allowing white a whole side....]
