C[hmph: This is a close game, being a 2.5pt game had there been normal komi.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[oq]TR[kq]C[hmph: looking back, i think playing at the marked point would be better, since the kakari allows a pincer.

L: you don't need to worry about a pincer. If you played at the marked point you had allowed your opponent to make a shimari. According to classical go theory this was the reason for your approach.
If you really dislike the result of the pincer you could consider playing the high approach at p4 wich proffesionals seem to play four times more often than the low approach (cfr. gobase.org)]
;W[lq]
(;B[qn]TR[qm]SQ[oq]C[hmph: I should have played this at the marked spot instead, since that is joseki. I had planned for that, but somehow wanted to try R6. What's wrong with R6, leading it not to be part of standard joseki?

L: some remarks:
First of al your move seems to exist so it is some kind of joseki. But the result is complicated as there rests al lot of aji in your marked stone. I think you should play this way if you are a good fighter.
var2 shows a more easy continuation
var3 is form the only professional game i found with the same pincer

Conserning the difference r6 r7: i think it are just different ways of playing, both complicated (to complicated as far as i'm concerned ;-) )]
;W[po];B[pn]
(;W[no]LB[on:a]C[hmph: didn't expect this. which was better?

L: The variation should be better, more solid.
The played white stone is only good i think if white 'll play at 'a' afterwards]

(;B[qj]C[hmph: I think this move was too hasty. I should have played the other variation, but it seems to reduce the adji in the corner. So which was better?

L: to know this you should have a good knowledge of the aji in the corner. The variation shows a few possibilitys. apparently there still rests quite some aji in the corner.
But it is important to see that p6 is a very good point for white to play, so it is also good for black.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[dj];B[fq]TR[er]C[hmph: i played this as i was afraid that W would form a big moyo here. I was afraid of a reply at the marked point.

L: see variation]
(;W[fo]LB[cq:a][dr:b][hp:c]C[hmph: didn't expect this
L: the common responses are a, b and c. Personally i prefer b]
;B[iq];W[dr]C[This looks good, make territory and attacking.]
;B[er]C[hmph: is this a little slow?

L: it doesn't look lide a nice move, but on the other hand playing more to the left is likely to provoque a white response there wich might take away your aji.]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[dq];B[fp];W[eo];B[kr];W[lr];B[kq]
(;W[nc]LB[lp:A][mp:B][mq:C][nq:D][mr:E][nr:F][ls:G]C[hmph: I knew this left the moves of A-G for B, but i thought it was small at this point. Hence, i responded to the kakari instead of playing A to G.

L: it is not that smal because you have a nice follow up. see the variation.
Moreover both black as white could give a hane at the head of two stones. so playing there is big for both of you.]

(;B[ob]LB[pf:a]TR[qj]C[L: i'm not fond of this move. It is considdered rather slow and defensive. Locally i'd play 'a' so you make a nice combination with the marked stone.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[nb];B[jc]TR[ob]LB[pb:a][kc:b][ic:c]C[hmph: Is this a bit too close to W?

L: this feels strange: the marked stone is considered a very defensive move (defends the corner) and now you use it to attack. Moreover you allow Wa and this is verry nice for him. 
I'd play Ba Wb and then you attack with Bc. This way your stones have better shape.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[oa];B[lb];W[ne];B[qf]TR[pf]C[hmph: couldn't decide between this and the marked spot.

L: certainly at the marked spot. You want to attack so you must play higher, and you have a stone at r10. Now your stones on the right are too low.]
;W[hc]
(;B[hb]LB[id:a]C[hmph: I regret this move.

L: see variations
'a' is better i think (var4)];W[ib];B[ic];W[gb];B[hd];W[gc]
;B[gd];W[fb];B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[jb];B[kb]LB[kc:a]C[L: this is an overplay. Better at 'a']

(;W[ha]C[L: looks like white trusted the calculation of black too much]
;B[md];W[of];B[ch]LB[ef:a]C[hmph: I knew W could invade the corner, but i knew my wall at the top could not be utilised if i defended the corner instead. Additionally, the W moyo looked threatening and i thought i was behind. Am i behind?

L: You are right not to defend the corner, it is very smal compared to the white moyo. A white move at 'a' would be a catastoph to you. So invading is indeed the most logical option. 
I think white is ahead at this point, but it depends on who succeeds first in playing at the bottom right.]
;W[dh]LB[cj:a]C[L: Playing at 'a' instead would have been more quiet and better than in the game. moreover black needs another move to save his stone so white has sente to (i reapeat) play in the bottom right (=BR)]
;B[di];W[ci];B[ei];W[bh];B[cj];W[bi];B[dk]C[hmph: B can capture the ko here, so was it a mistake for W?

L: I think so. White didn't want to give black territory so he lost a lot of his own.]
;W[ck]C[hmph: didn't expect this
L: i don't think this is good for white.];B[ej];W[bj];B[cl]
;W[dj];B[bk];W[cj]C[L: good respons by black. Now white has a fat, hump of stones, and his moyo at the bottom is completly erased.]
;B[em]LB[el:a]C[L: It looks like you want to play in a sabaki way. But i think playing at a is sufficient and more safe.]
;W[dn];B[ce]LB[bl:a]C[i wanted to protect the corner, but is this move really sente?

L: not absolutely sente because white can always play a for example to save his group in the most easy way.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[de];B[cd];W[bf];B[df]LB[bm:a][ph:b]C[hmph: is this cut alright? I felt that i was behind, so i had to take risks.

L: not the most urgent place on the board. BR or 'a' or 'b' are also big. I prefer 'b']
;W[dg];B[ef];W[eg];B[qq]C[L: finally];W[rq];B[bm];W[id]LB[oh:a]
C[hmph: this move looks to me to be an overplay since the upper right white group looks unsettled.

L: Both players seem to do thier best to make the game as complicated as possible. 
BR is the most urgent now, but it is true that this is a defect in your position.
If white wants to cut there he must first lean on your position on the right. For example 'a' is the calmest move.]

L: to me neither.];B[jg];W[if];B[le];W[mc]C[L: this is no use for white.]

(;B[mf]C[L: this is not the good order, see variation.];W[nf]
;B[ni];W[mi]LB[mh:a]C[L: if you had played the variation, it would have been as if white answers now at 'a' which is clearly bad for him.]
;B[oi];W[ek]LB[kh:a]C[hmph: again missing the point? Defending the upper right still looks like the right move to me.
L: Wa is better i think. It defends and attacks at the same time.]

C[L: strange move. 'a' would have been absolutely safe];W[qk]

(;B[rn]C[hmph: I was trying to play safe since i thought i was leading.
L: see previous comment.
you are leading, but you must try to keep your groups connected, this is the safest play, see variation.
Moreover, keeping your groups connected often assures you of extra points.]
;W[rl];B[so];W[qa];B[rb];W[jo];B[jl]TR[jk][jm][jn]LB[il:a][im:b]
[fr:c]C[hmph: too deep?
L: suppose you play at 'a' or 'b' instead and you force white to play on the triangled point. If i count estimate the score i obtain

W: 50
B: 58

So after you force white to make territory you have sente to play at 'c' for example (8points)]
