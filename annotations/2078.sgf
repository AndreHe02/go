AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello.  Thank you for reviewing my game.  I am Sirkut, playing
white.  I felt like I was ahead most of the so I was a bit surprised
when I lost by 12.5.


Hi Bill,

I'll do my best to share my ideas as I go over your game.

Robin Hobbes (Robin on igs)];W[np]LB[jp:A]C[Lately I've been trying to learn more about the openning because
I think it is one of my weaknesses.  Perhaps here I should not
start with joseki, but something more flexible a less risky like
K4.  Instead, I play K4 on my second move.

I think at the beginning of a 5 stone handicap game white wants
to play lightly for the first few stones. Hopefully he can then
capitalise on the aji created later.];B[oq]C[Black plays to close to white .. white does not need to respond
.. I would play at the opposite corner now like c14. or I would
attack black at r6 hoping that I could seal black in. If that
happened it would be a wonderful result for white];W[jp]C[White plays loose .. good]
;B[hq]
(;W[fq]C[Seems like I invaded too early.

I think a little early .. any invasion will solidify both positions
and you do not want black to have any increased power at the
moment.

See variation as one possible way for white to play lightly]
;B[ho]C[I would now attack black h3 group .. see variation]

(;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[fp];W[gr];B[gq];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[go]
C[The big problem for white now is that black has sealed white
in and has massive power .. it becomes a very difficult game
for white now]
(;W[do]C[I think this is too much .. c6 would be better];B[co]
C[Sirkut [13k\]: watch your time

Black makes a mistake d6 is better .. let white have those two
stones .. it is nothing];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[cm]C[This begins a run that give black a large solid group on the
left.  I was trying to get a wall of influence into the center,
but I feel I shouldn't have carried it as far as I did, but I
wasn't sure how to stop it sooner.

This is good play by white .. capitalise on blacks mistake]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[cf];B[cd]C[I would protect the cutting point here I think]

(;W[be]TR[jc][fc][qj][nc][qf]C[This seems too slow .. end game move really

I have marked where I would thin pf playing at this point];B[bd]
;W[ci]C[Again too slow as this isn't sente];B[bi];W[bh];B[ce]
;W[df];B[hr];W[bq]C[Yes white has to play to live];B[bp];W[aq]
;B[ap];W[jr];B[jn];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[ns];W[ms];B[pr];W[jd]
C[I like this area although I think I would play k17];B[gc]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]C[When I hit this joseki in games, I don't think I'm playing it
right.. Black ends up with large moyo facing away from the corner
and I don't seem to get that much in return.];W[oc];B[pc]
(;W[pj]TR[qg][qf]C[This is too loose now as it invites black to play r13 and get
lots of territory

I would play where I have marked the board];B[qg];W[pn];B[qo]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[rp];W[sn];B[ro]C[White plays well here]
;W[hd];B[so]MA[fk][jl][ri][fn]C[endgame move bigger places around]
;W[sm];B[ln];W[lp];B[nn]TR[hj][en][hc][ri]C[White doesnt need to play p5 .. both white groups are ok so better
to play at the marked places];W[oo];B[ml];W[ec]LB[bf:A][ch:B]
C[Here I hoped I had enough aji on either side to make this successful.
But I know that my shape around B13 is weak and probably just
got lucky.

In a 5 stone game white must overplay sometimes .. this seems
as good as anywhere to do that!!];B[dc]
(;W[gd]C[See variation .. you really have to split up black now that he
makes a mistake];B[fc];W[ed];B[eb];W[fd];B[hc];W[ic];B[hb];W[ib]

(;W[fk];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[gk];B[gn]C[E9 is not necessary]

(;W[ek];B[ik];W[hk];B[nj];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[mh]C[At this point I'm starting to get a little worried.  Black has
3 corners and a fourth solid group.  I have two groups in decent
shape, two in risky shape but some strong center moyo.  Still
seems even though.];W[me];B[nf];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[jg];W[hg]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[mg]C[Again o13 not necessary as cutting here does not threaten a group]

(;W[ng];B[nh];W[og];B[od]C[White must play to protect n17 now]

(;W[lg];B[kg];W[lh]
(;B[li]C[Now begins may attempt to break up black's center aji, but I
don't feel I'm very strong at the tactics in this part of the
game, and black's responses are good.];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[le]
;W[ld]C[Black has helped white safeguard the weakness at n17]

[er][kr][lr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][ks][ls]C[White plays a safe game and underestimates the territory he owns
and looses by rather a lot. I think it would improve white of
he developed  three parts of his game. 1. When playing 5 stone
handicap games as white play lightly for the first few moves
to create lots of arji.
2. Only cut two groups when the cut results in an attack on black
such that black needs to get a further eye. then make territory
by attacking black
3.Consider the biggest moves on the board and play endgame moves
(ones that solidify the edges of your territory) after playing
the moves that significantly expand your territory or effectively
attakce black.])
