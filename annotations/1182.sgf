AB[pd][dp]C[
Dear reviewer, I'm playing black. My questions start with "o:" Thank you for taking your time to review this game.

Hello Theodore Kolokolnikov , I'm Jonas T. Doi, a brazilian player.. I'm glad to review your game. My English is a bit poor, but I think you will not have too much problems to understand me. And have in your mind that I'm not telling you the exactly right thing to do, but I will help you to understand the sittuations and show you other alternatives to take a better profit of your play.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[ql]C[o: Somehow, r8 seems overly aggressive? Oh well, this is a handicap game...

It's sure agressive.. In your game level, it is a bit dificult to give up a territory, to achieve a better cause.. You should have in mind that in a handicap game, the stones you have in the 4-4 point, don't make a territory on the corner for sure, so you have to be prepared to use this stone to make influence or attack your opponent stones.. For exemple here, your R3 group is not alive, but it's in Sabaki, there will be no problem to make eyes here. But, if take a look at the O3 group you are in sente, so you have the initiative to attack him.. There is no need to worry about your group for now.. Attack the R 8 stone is better.. See variation]

(;B[qr]C[o: I considered r10 as an alternative; but thought that would leave my r3 group too weak... Any other alternative?

There is a lot of variations.. This move is not wrong..];W[pq]
;B[qj];W[ol];B[nn];W[qo];B[qp];W[qn];B[op];W[kq]
(;B[oj]C[o: Maybe q7 first?];W[pk];B[pj];W[pg]C[o: Seems like an un reasonable play... Now w has two weak groups to care for...

Yeah, he's trying to invade your moyo, but he has 2 weak groups ande the threestone wall is very thick.. Too bad for white]
;B[mk];W[ml];B[pm];W[pl];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[ro];B[rk];W[rp]
;B[sm]C[S3 better];W[sn];B[rn];W[po];B[oo];W[rm];B[sl];W[nk]
;B[nj];W[lk];B[mj];W[ln];B[lm]C[o: o14 better?

Yes because, it's not possible to kill the white group at this point.. So you have to secure you moyo..]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[nl];B[mn];W[km];B[lo];W[kn]
(;B[ko]C[o: My plan was to attack o3... In hindsight, o2 seems to work. See variation.

See N2 variation];W[jo];B[lq];W[lr];B[oq];W[or];B[kp];W[jq]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[np];W[jp];B[nr];W[ns]C[Trying to take the three stones on the botton is to small!! Tenuki now!!]
;B[ps];W[nq]C[White lost his chance to run away with is weak stone at Q13]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[nr];W[om];B[on];W[nq];B[ne];W[nr];B[ng];W[mo]
C[o: Unreasonable?

Yes, sente for you, he got just about 6 points..];B[rq];W[mp]
;B[fd];W[jd];B[cf]C[Not sure about this move... Maybe f14 first? Or d14? Suggestions?

Both moves are common];W[df]C[If you are trying to take the corner, see variation]

(;B[cc]C[Again, perhaps there is a better reply?];W[dc];B[cd]
;W[ce];B[be];W[cg];B[de];W[ee]C[Close here C 15 here.. See variations..]

(;B[ed]C[o: c15 better?

Yeah, see the var of move 91];W[ce];B[bf];W[de];B[bg];W[ch]
C[If you want to run, keima or kosumi is possible... If you choose keima, you will sacrifice the 2 stones and make a wall attacking the K16]

(;B[hf]C[o: my time is low here. My opponent gave me extra time later.  o: This is one of those moments in the game where it's difficult to guess the right move...

If you want to run away with the F 16 group, you shouldn't extend this way, you have a severe cut at G 15.. A keima is better but a kosumi is possible here too..]
;W[cn];B[cp]C[o: white's wall comes alive... Did I neglect the lonely d4 for too long?

The problem is that you didn't get the sente.. Sente is very important..]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[ge];B[cl]C[o: My opponent was kind enough to give me extra time at this point.]
;W[el]C[This move from white is terrible!!!! After you play on the top, you should cut C6..]
;B[he];W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[ic];W[id]
(;B[gc]C[o: "trigger-happy" move... Locally, j18 seems better in hindsight? It starts a very complicated fight... See variation.

Your variation is the right way to play.. The battle that started in the game is a bit unreasonable..]

;W[dm];B[cm];W[do];B[en];W[eo]C[o: if I connect with c5 here, white gets what looks like a big chunk in the middle...

This battle comes from errors from both sides.. I won't show all the variations that you should play because it's something you have to improve by yourself.. But, here, black HAS TO PLAY C5!! It is huge!!]

(;B[em]C[o: See alternative g10. Not sure what's better.];W[gj]
;B[dl]C[There are many variations.. C2 would be much more severe but, black can save the D4 group if it descend to B4 and peep at B6.. I didn't figure out a way to kill the entire group or a way to black to save all his stones..]

(;W[bp]C[c2 seems more severe... perhaps black even dies?];B[bq]
C[Well, the rest of the game, white plays some non-sense moves to take the lead, so my comments ends here..
I enjoy a lot review your game, and I expect that my comments help you.. If you want to ask something else, you can send me an e-mail: jdoi@uol.com.br. See ya!!]
