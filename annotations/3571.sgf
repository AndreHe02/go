(;B[qj]C[I don't know a lot about josekis is it right/possible to do for the moment ?

[MW\]: Well, technically this isn't joseki yet, it's fuseki.
I think R10 is ok, but maybe a little bit slow. Playing the first two moves on hoshi (4-4 point) means, you're trying to play an influence game rather than based on territory (since both cornes are open for invasion). So playing the standard san-ren-sei on Q10 would maybe be a little bit better.

But playing on Q10 or R10 means also, you're giving away your big advantage as black in the beginning: sente. White has now all options, can freely decide where to play now, where to invade black, and black has to wait and see what white will do.

I would probably prefer keeping sente and attacking one of the white corners (see variations). Especially the UL (upper left) corner, since white is threatening there to make a huge corner-enclosure with something like D15.]
;W[hp];B[kc]C[He takes some territorry, I take some...fair ?
Maybe I should ensure mine because I have more than him for the moment...

[MW:\] Well, at the moment there isn't any real territory on the board. Black has two open corners and white has something like territory on the BL (bottom left), which is still invadeble.

The move at L17 isn't bad, since it takes an important point at the upper side. Still I would prefer to attack one the white corners.]
;W[np]C[Now white attacks your corner while making territory on the lower side.]

(;B[pq]C[Don't know how to answer this... is it ok? I thought : don't let him go to the bottom left corner

[MW:\] Better to play at Q6 or R6, to support your stone on R10 and to make territory on the side. Q3 prevents the 3-3-invasion but leaves the BR side still open for invasion.]
;W[co]C[[MW:\] White secure it's corner and threatens a double-wing-formation, making huge territory on the BL corner.]

(;B[cj]C[I wanted to invade somewhere because he is actually taking a lot but I don't know if it's the right point to do it ?

[MW\]: Good, white gave you sente with securing its corner, so now you can invade or attack some of white weak groups. C10 looks okay. White taking C10 would've given him huge territory on the left side. Another possibility would have been to attack the UL corner or attacking the weakness on the lower side attacking the single stone.]
;W[cd]
(;B[oj]C[Maybe I should have play C14to ensure territory. ? I don't really know here, look toward the center.

[MW:\] Yes, I think this move is too slow, too peaceful. And IF you want to play peaceful, than better secure the UR corner or the side by playing at R14 or R15 or Q7. C14 would be a little too far, since white could split black with C12.
The single white stone on O4 is still weak.];W[pf]C[[MW:\] Now white has to attack the corner to prevent black from getting a huge side.]

(;B[qf]C[I don't know anything about defense. Is it ok ?

[MW:\] Better not attach to the attacking stone. Attaching to a stone makes it stronger. Better to secure the corner by playing at O16, making territory on the upper side and connecting to your weak stone at L17.]
;W[qg];B[pg]C[[MW:\] the cross-cut is very risky, white could start some ugly fighting by playing R15 or S14]

(;W[of]C[What do I do if he play Q12 ?

[MW:\] Instead of P14? Play at P14 yourself and capture the white stone at Q14 (see variation)]
;B[qh];W[qe];B[rg];W[kp]C[The bottom is now nearly white territory. Maybe still invadable, but things would get difficult now.]
;B[pe];W[nn]
(;B[om]C[P6 is better ? Or N10 maybe ? Hane at O14 ?

[MW:\] I think this move is okay, maybe Q6 or Q7 would be slightly better. (Better not to attach to an attacking stone.)

What should N10 do?

O14 would attach to the white stones ... better play N14 instead, if you want to attack these stones.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[or];B[pr];W[nq]
(;B[qd]C[[MW:\] I think this is too slow. Better play around O17 making territoriy at the top while securing the corner. (At least after O17 it would be hard for white to get his stone at R15 to live in the corner. )
Another option would be reducing white's territory with C7.]

(;W[mf];B[cm]C[I should have play C14 maybethis is a bit narrow...

[MW:\] No, C7 is good. It prevents white from making a double-wing-formation, getting huge territory at the BR.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[Still don't know how to defend correctly and what's following ?

[MW:\] difficult situation. I would have probably played P17, forcing white to extend to O16 and then taking sente to play H17 and secure the stone on L17, making territory on the upper side.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[ne];B[od];W[cg]
(;B[bh]C[[MW:\] Good move, reducing white an securing the black group ... but I think H17 would have been bigger. Or maybe a reduction move around E6.]
;W[ni];B[nb]C[[MW:\] too slow ... I think it would've been very difficult for white to get this stone alive. Better H17.]
;W[ic]C[[MW:\] Now white took the last big point on the board.]

(;B[ld]C[[MW:\] this is too slow. It threatens only to capture one stone, white can ignore this move.
Better attack the weak J17 stone or reduce white with E6, D6 or B6, or punish white for ignoring your B12 stone with playing B14 and taking away some of white's territory.]
;W[em]
(;B[ej]C[E9 ? K18 ? O10 ? Something else ?

[MW:\] E7 threatens to make a huge territory on the lower side. Playing E9 or E10 doesn't do anything against this and isn't making any territory for yourself.
E7 is in my opinion a little bit too far, so better to punish it immediately with D6. Don't let white get away too easily with this.]
;W[ll];B[nj];W[gl]
(;B[gj]C[[MW:\] With its last two moves white made an huge territory. H10 is too slow. If you want to have a chance of winning now, you have to kill the upper right group. So better play around N11 or L14.]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[fg];B[hg];W[he];B[kf]C[[MW:\] good ... cutting white off]
;W[le];B[ke];W[mh]
(;B[mj];W[lj]C[How could I have avoid this ?

(;B[lh];W[jj];B[ji];W[ki]C[I really didn't see the atari I was focusing elsewhere but after I thought maybe I did good if I had connected at L11, he could have entered me at K11 ?

[MW:\] Yes, sacrifying L10 was okay, probably you could've played L11 instead of M12 before, to prevent this. But anyway, you successfully seperated the UR white stones from the rest, which was your primary target here. This white group should be dead now, the game is even.]

(;B[fh]C[Is this ok ?

[MW:\] yes, why not, although you have to keep in mind, that attaching a stone at two opponent stones like this can put this stone immediately in atari with the next move. So playing instead at G11 directly would'nt change much in terms of points, but would'nt put your stone in danger.]

C[Thanks for reviewing

[MW:\] I enjoyed reviewing this game very much. It was a good game and without the errors at the lower right side you would have had a fair chance of winning.

Overall, you gave your opponent a huge territory on the lower side, which you normally don't want to allow. But you got good compensation by catching the white stones on the upper right side.

As you have overseen several ataris, this really shoudnt happen ... take your time for every move, look at the move of your opponent and try to understand, why he probably played there.

Don't rate yourself as 30kyu next time, you're far better, I would guess around 20kyu or something.

Since this was my first review, feel free to give me any feedback if it was helpful, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.]
