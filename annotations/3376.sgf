C[ **please review the white side**
my questions/statements are located at moves...

   22,29,49,55,86,117,128,185

...of course if you see any other flaw that i've made please point i out.

***your help is much appreciated***

xed_over:    I hope my comments prove useful.

Some things to work on:

1)  Don't try so hard to kill your opponent's stones.  This is a game of sharing (only you want the bigger half :))

Surrounding from afar will help limit your opponent's territory, while gaining territory for yourself.

2)  Look for "bigger" or more urgent moves.  Be willing to sacrifice some of your stones in order to gain an advantage elsewhere.

3)  Try to keep your own group connected (don't let your opponent separate your groups).]

xed_over:  At this point in the game, I don't see that its necessary.  You are well ahead so far, strengthen what you have.]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[eq];B[gq];W[er];B[cn]LB[dk:A][dn:B]C[how should i have gone about pushing the black stone out of where i want my territory?

xed_over:  Attaching usually strengthens your opponent.  A (d9) makes a nice pincer and extension at the same time.

Don't think of it as your territory yet.  Your opponent will get some territory whether you them to or not.  You can't kill everything.  Just keep your groups alive and connected, while minimizing your opponent's territory best you can.]

xed_over:  One the other hand, sacrificing this stone gives you an opportunity to strengthen the corner above.]

(;W[ag]LB[ce:1][cg:A]C[xed_over:  A (c13) would have been better here.  Black would not then invade at 1 (c15).  Even so, you would have been in better position to ward off further attacks.]
;B[ce]LB[cd:A]TR[ag][bg][ch]C[i'm thinkin' that playing at "A" would have been a better move

xed_over:  No, either way, your B13 group will be in trouble.  Take the corner and let Black have that group for now.  Who knows, but maybe that group will prove to be a useful sacrifice later in the game.]

[ch][dh][eh]C[Here i try to surrond my opponents stones but what i really wanted to was invade the top right stones, though i can't tell where to begin my attack.

xed_over:  The D12 group is all but dead already.  Don't throw good stones after bad.  If you want to invade the upper right, then go ahead and give it a try.  What's the worst that can happen? You might lose the game? :) (just kidding)

Several fun possibilities are there. Not sure which would be best.  Maybe A (N16)]

(;W[kd]LB[mf:B]C[xed_over:  Too soon. You'll just push Black into your other group which is not yet secure.

Running out is better.  It keeps Black separated and gives you a better chance to connect up with your right side group.]

;B[hd]LB[he:A][hf:B]TR[gc]C[xed_over:  G17 eye is now false.  White A, Black B makes G15 eye false also, killing the white group.  

A Play at B (H14) is your best bet, with a chance to run out to the center.]
;W[hb]LB[hf:A]C[xed_over: Wasted move, that eye is already false.  Black A kills the group.]

;B[ga]LB[hf:A][hg:B]C[xed_over: Yea!!  Black gives you a huge chance!  Those three stones are willing to sacrifice their lives for their brothers. White A lives. (Even White B lives also)  What will you do?]

xed_over:  Save your other group now!!!

Okay, you never do, and eventually that group dies (100 moves later)

So, the M16 group....

Separate black's stones, or jump out towards the center.];W[le]
C[xed_over:  Too slow.  A one space jump would help you move out faster.]

xed_over:  Never count on that.  Even if your opponent is a beginner, rest assured that they are learning (and sometimes even during the game)

A move like Q1 can be used at other times for a ko threat (just store that in the back of  your mind for later).]
