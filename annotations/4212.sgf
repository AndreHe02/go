this game was very close until end i think
I'm not sure what i need to work on right now xD
I usually try to stay away from making running groups but i
had a big one in this game.
Some of the moves might seem pointless or very small
because i was stressed on time and thanks for reviewing!];W[dq]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[do];W[fq];B[cl];W[nq]C[white's chosen position looks too low and conentrated
on the bottom.];B[lq]TR[np]C[this looks wrong to me, but not outrageously bad.
It is predictable that white will jump out, and both
black groups will need to scramble to survive.

This sets the direction for the whole game.  My choice
would have been to press down at O4, which forces
white to defend an ineffeciently low position on the
bottom, and tends to leave black with powerful
influence toward the top.];W[no];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[jq]C[wanted to play o7 right away but i felt like this stone
should run

This looks like an error for white to me.  If black
jumps up to M5 as you would expect,  the white
group O3 is in trouble.  So by playing this way,
white is just weakening his own group.];B[kp]C[when white responds to this at K4, white will
be stonger and black will be weaker. So why
would black play this way?];W[jp];B[nm]C[If white just plays to contain here, it looks very bad
for black (see variations) if black tries to defend m3-l4.
Don't take these as definitive, but they're what I would 
be thinking.   Since black can't defend, he should
abandon the two and take his profit on the right
side.]

got some stones in trouble, and the only way

true, but the mistake is being in this situation
at all.];B[pl]C[black loves this another extension on the

of errors type game, where both players lost large
groups unnecessarily.  Least blunder wins.

Tactical reading will improve with practice, and
the blunders will end up looking smaller because
the big groups will all survive, but the real weakness
that needs to be improved is to select an overall
direction of play that doesn't lead to these huge
running fights.

It's not necessary or wise to contest every point
and try to kill every group.  It's about getting the
bigger piece of the pie, not getting the whole pie.

Think about how the expected response will
affect the local situation, and try to play moves
that will simplify your subsequent situation,
not make them more complex.])
