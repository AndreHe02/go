RE[W+6.5]

C[Hi,
My main concern on this game is how could I improve my general play. I sometimes play moves that degenerate in a huge loss of territory. It seems that I don't see the larger consequences of my moves.

I've tried to analyse bad moves that I saw, but I'm sure there's plenty more!!!!

Any other tips would be welcome.

Thanks!

PS : I play Black on this game.

Xif: Actually this is a good invasion here. See your varations and they can all live. Your goal should be to be able to chase the group and build up a wall or territory]

Thank you for the revision!
Simon.

Xif: I think you played a pretty good game. You have a good grasp of making sure not to leave weak groups weak and a decent endgame. However you begining needs to be focused more on the whole board and less on the local move. Also you need to look for whites weak groups and attack them a bit more aggressivly. I think you play a bit to quick. Try taking your hand off the mouse during internet games and keep your hand off the stones in person to person games, take the time to consider other moves and evalutate them. You seen to be playing the first move you see a lot of the time. If you have questions you can email me back or find me online on KGS as Xif (Although I am not on much during the summer) Also I am only a 10 kyu player my and my comments maybe wrong in some areas so don't take my words as the law but as some suggestions to help you improve.]
