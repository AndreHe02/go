C[Hi, My name is Johanna Tuominen, and I'm EGF 4 kyu from Finland. The Ko fight in the game was big, and it favored white, but resigning the game at that point was not necessary. Black had nice inluence towards the rest of the board, so the game was still playable. However, you weren't able to utilize it, allthough you had possibilities to do that. 

The Ko fight included lots of variations how black can play. In general you should concentrate the number of Ko threats that you have, and of course how many your opponent has. The Ko-fight like in the game has significant impact for the rest of the game. Thus, if you don't have enough threats, consider just direct connection, or is there some other way to refuse may be few threats later.

Well, the result was area for white, and influence for black. At this point of the game, black should concentrate to make profit out of he influence. For instance does white have some weak group that black can attack on, which you spotted correctly but you didn't kill it while you had a chance. In general the killing is not necessary in all cases since one way to use influence is to chase opponents group, and at the same time make territory of your own. 

Hopefully my comments help, and enjoy the game of Go!
 
 My (Black, zwoelefant) strength: 11k* on IGS

Topics: Use of influence and Ko fight.

There was an interesting and very big Ko fight at an very early stage of the game. I (black, zwoelefant) lost it in the end, but was contended with the result. Although white had about 30 points secured I got overwhelming influence over the rest of the board. Unfortunately I was not able to use these influence in the right way and had to resign. So my general question is: Was my feeling right, that the game was still not decided after the Ko-fight and what would have been the right way to take adventage of my gained influence?]
;B[pc];W[dd];B[dp];W[pq];B[po]C[JT: I added few Joseki variations  for this high approach which can be useful in the future.]

(;W[np]
(;B[pl]LB[pe:F][qe:E][qj:B][qm:C][qn:D][qp:A]TR[po]C[JT: I consider this move somewhat questionable... It is of course influence oriented move which is not bad. But then you should have plan how to use it. However, the two marked stones are very vulnerable to attack. White can thread black to steal base from A or B. Or steal it attacking from C or D. Also the approach move at F or E allmost forces black to pincer otherwise an extension to B is a multipurpose move for white (fixes white shape, and attacks at the same time), See the Joseki  variation from this situation. Thus black cannot expect to gain much territory if he does not utilize the influence well.]

(;W[cn];B[dj];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[zwoelefant: I am not sure any more of this move. Would it be better to play it at F4 or somewhere else?

JT: This is better than F4. See also variations from move 10.]
;W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[br];B[iq]C[zwoelefant: I wanted to use my wall at the left side and thought a pincer is quite the right attack. Was this really a good idea, or should I have played somewhere else (M3 or around K16 resp. Q11)?

JT: Idea is OK. The other moves are also big, but choosing the attack move is ok as well.]
;W[fo];B[io];W[fm];B[dl]C[JT: The D7 in D6 would be more secure, because the cutting point in D6 caused you a lot of trouble later on in the game.]

(;B[on]C[zwoelefant: I thought of linking up with my group around L4 and to wall of the lower right corner. Is this idea o.k. or should I have played maybe at R6?

JT: Your group in the lower side is ok at the moment, because you can always play at for instance at G2. Therefore playing R6 instead of P6 is better. See the variation from move 34.]

(;B[jk]LB[jk:A][hl:C][jo:B]C[zwoelefant: I played this move, because I had the following sequence in mind (see variation 1: wH8, bJ9, wH9, bH10). Now I think it would have been better to play at K6 (see variation 2) or even H8 (see variation 3). Is one of this three moves correct, or is there another better move?

JT: I like the C variation most, because it gives you the most solid influence. The B lets white out and possibility to attack your wall on the left side aswell. I continued these variations a bit with some comments.]

(;W[jo]LB[hl:B][jo:A];B[ko]C[zwoelefant: It took me some time, before I made this move, but I didn't want to be cut. Should I have risked maybe J4?]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[ho];B[hp];W[hq];B[io]LB[gp:A]C[zwoelefant: This is the promised Ko fight, and I think you will agree that it becomes larger and larger... Maybe you can look at my Ko threads: Are they o.k. or would there have been other possibilities?

JT: Well the ko ended up in very dominating position in the game. At first I considered, what if white would have played in A. See the variation.]

(;W[kl]C[JT: At this point, what if black just connects the Ko.]

(;B[ll];W[ip];B[gp];W[fp];B[io];W[kk]C[At this point black have go threats in G3 or G5 and also in R3. However white has one severe threat in D7. So maybe at this point I would have connect the Ko]

(;B[ik];W[ip];B[gq];W[hr];B[io];W[er];B[dr];W[ip];B[gr]C[zwoelefant: Maybe better at G5?

JT: Its not over but b√∂ack has to able to utilize the influence well.]

(;W[ph]LB[sa:B][ph:A]C[zwoelefant: For me this white move is a failure. I would have played on the upper side around G16. So I was quite happy and tried to enlarge my influence...

JT: Well you should also consider the territory at this phase since you are behind.]

(;B[kj]TR[nh][oh][mi][ni][lj][mj][lk]SQ[ll]C[JT: White can still escape since ladder favors white in two ways. It hits the white stone on the right side and on the way ataris the squared stone.]

(;B[ie]C[zwoelefant: This move was intented to prevent a white eye, but maybe it would have been better somewhere else?

(;B[lh]TR[li][lj][kk][lk][jl][kl]C[zwoelefant: Maybe this one was a failure. Is this move better at O13 or P12?

JT: Well it depends what black wants to do. The M12 move that you played threatens to kill the marked stones. That is if white tenukis black plays N11.
P12 is also sente move. See the variation from move 162. 

The O13 is too passive since it leaves a white a chance to atari.]
