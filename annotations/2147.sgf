;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[jq]C[I'm not sure about this move for white. I can't really see what it is aiming to achieve. I can't say it's bad, but it feels a little lukewarm.]
;B[dr]LB[cq:a][dn:b]C[I would prefer to jump straight out to F5 and preserve the 3-3 invasion. 



More usual responses would be at A or around B];W[dn]C[An odd response- i expected c3]
;B[fo]C[At A would be an interesting alternative. It's a big move terratorially, and I can't see a good reply for white.]

The exchange of 7 for 10 does look unnecessary now, though.]

;B[fm];W[dl];B[pj]LB[mm:a]C[Was Q10 the best move? (biggest/most important)



It's hard to criticise because it's very big. 

If white can settle the K2-5 stones then he can regard the loss of 4 stones as a good exchange so black's key to success lies in attacking them.

35 is a good start.



From now on, until about move 73,  I think that the important direction of play relates to the weak white stones. A black play around A (N7) would be huge.]
;W[nc]C[I think it's worth tenuki-ing here and playing around N7]

(;B[kc]C[I think L17 was good responce, M17 would have been too close to O17. Thinking in the whole board, can you suggest a better/bigger move?



It's a good move. M17 is good too. See variation.

I still would play at the bottom right, though];W[qf]
(;B[qh]LB[oe:a][nd:b][pf:c][qc:d]C[This is not needed - Q10 already limits the stone from this direction.



Usual responses  are A B or C, or in special circumstances at D.

Here probably B or C are best];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[Did i chose the right side here?



The lower side is bigger for black, so this follows the principle 'block on the larger side', but with 39 in place it feels overconcentrated. See Variation.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nd];B[of]C[This is overconcentrated. O15 is aggressive, but feels better.]
;W[oc];B[hc]C[A move at O15 is good shape across the right hand side and helps L17 indirectly as well. 


Don't be afraid to sacrifice the L17 stone - the right hand side is bigger than the top.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf]C[This feels very overconcentrated now. 

I think that the best thing to do would be to try to sacrifice the three stones PQR--16, but I'm not strong enough to figure out how exactly.



Consider how small these moves are compared to one attacking white's weeak group though...]
;W[fc];B[fd]C[Black usually plays like this when he is weak. You don't need to attach. how about jumping to H15 instead?]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[ec];W[eb];B[ic];W[ed];B[he]C[The black group is now safe, but white has got terratory in the corner in exchange.

On the whole, white has got the best of this exhange, and in sente.



Assessing the whole board, you have about 15 points on the bottom left, plus the right hand moyo. 



White has about 14 in the bottom left, 10 in the top right and maybe 20 in the top left. Plus of course, the weak group on the bottom.



Therefore you need to make about 30 points from your moyo to win. I think you're ahead, but your lead has shrunk with the plays across the top.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[Good - makes white heavy and takes terratory.]
;W[qk]C[Black is strong here, so white must play lightly. I would consider 68 at P6 maybe, but this is possible too.]

(;B[pl]C[A big battle has begun ...  

I ended up losing the battle here and would like so see some variations on how i could have succeeded



When big fights break out the variations are too many for most of us amateurs to read out. the important thing, therefore, is to try to have an objective in mind during the fighting.  Here, you are strong, so you should seek to punish white's group. However you do not necessarily need to kill the group. The other weak white group along the bottom can also be attacked, so any splitting attack will be powerful.



69 looks like building thickness toward the centre. However, white's O16 stone will limit any central moyo.



A standard response to the R5 attachment is White at Q6, so perhaps 69 at Q6 is good too.]

(;B[ql]C[You can consider 93 -94 as more-or-less miai for the life of the white group.

93 is a purely local move but 94 (or N5 maybe) has a whole-board effect so is better.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[rj];B[sj];W[np];B[nq]C[Because block at 101 doesn't work, a play at N4 makes more sense. Letting the two weak groups connect is a disaster]

;B[mn];W[lq];B[ln];W[kp];B[kj]C[I chose L10 move instead of protecting my stones at P3. Was this a good choice?



It looks as though the black group will live. I would play elswhere also, but I am not sure about 109.



Maybe a move around N15 would be better with regard the centre]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[or];B[pr];W[rq];B[rr]C[White still has 10 in the top right, 15 in the bottom left and  20 odd in the top left as well as 15 due to the bottom right group.



You have 10 across the right, 15 on the bottom and 12 in the bottom right. 



You have some power in the centre, but white's potential across the left is better, I think. White can be happy with his invasion.]

I count roughly:

White has:

11 in the top right

16 in the bottom right

12 in the bottom left

20 in the top left



You have:

25 in the centre

10 in the bottom right

22 on the left

10 on the top.
