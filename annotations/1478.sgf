AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[f:  This first set of notes is by fugume (Mark).  I played black.

Hi
Mark, I'll try to help review this game.  I don't get too detailed on
saving groups but more just tell some fundemental areas.  Usually these
avoid the need to save groups anyway.

I note you are playing
against a 12k, lost by about 100 which puts about the right area for
rank at the moment.  This should change quickly as you are asking for
advice from sites such as this.

To begin:  You have the
handicap, so use it offensively.  You do not have guarenteed territory
whatsoever at the beginning.  You use you stones to attack (force a
defensive response, not to kill) you opponents.

Hi, my name is Dave  Byrne (4k KGS)  I will give a second opinion on this game.]
;W[nq]C[Hi.
I am mainly interested in the game before move 200 or so.  Please see
comments inside.  Thanks in advance for the review.]
(;B[qo]LB[no:a][mp:b][qq:c]TR[jp][kp][lq]MA[pn][qn][qo]C[Right
off the back playing defensively.  The triangles make a good offensive
play making white respond a, b or c.  The x's play defensively which
white may tenuki or plap k-4 or l-4.

Play offenisively.  See variant.

DB: I agree];W[fq];B[cq]C[Again, too defensive.

DB:
Definitely.];W[fc];B[hc];W[fe];B[ec]MA[df]C[Bad, common move is the
marked spot, blocking whites attempt to wall your corner off.]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[cc]MA[dd][de][ee][dj][dp]C[Don't be afraid to make full triangles that face good directions.

The marked stones would play well together.

DB:
Strange shape for both players.....D17 works instead of c17.  This
keeps the original intent of c17.   Difficult to decide if it is better
or worse that d15.];W[de];B[ef];W[df];B[dg];W[eg]C[White overplays blatantly and is punished.

DB: good];B[ff];W[eh];B[cf];W[dh];B[ce]TR[cg];W[dm]
(;B[cm]C[Here is something good to learn.  Attaching to a stone does not attack, but stregthens your opponents stone.

You have a very weak corner.  Couple of ways are in variant]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[dl];W[em]
(;B[al]LB[bn:A]C[f:
Oops.  Probably should have played A here.  The two stone group is
short on liberty, and A would have helped that, in sente.

Lets
see];W[bn];B[bk]C[Bad.];W[ck];B[cj]LB[bj:A]TR[bk][al]C[f:  Instead,
maybe A?  That would have made one of the two connections needed to
save both marked stones.

Alright, now this may sound
patronizing.  Look at those two stones.  what do they accomplish that
prevents you playing at K-16, K-10 or K-4?

A worthy leader has to be willing to sacrifice men for a greater cause.

DB:
I don't even know if I would play a big point here.....The lower right
corner looks crippled......better to spend a move and avoid disaster.]
;W[am];B[bj];W[fm];B[kc];W[dk];B[or]TR[lq][oq]C[Two
triangles better than this.  Depending on your mood.  No joseki, just
play what feels right.  M-3 feels best as it leads to attack an F-3
soon.

DB: M3 far superior to p3 or p2];W[oq];B[pq];W[nr];B[pr];W[ch]
;B[cg]SQ[bh][bj][cj][dj][bk][al]C[DB: Big mistake.....b12 is essential to maintain connection to a living group.]
;W[bh]C[DB:  This is very painful for black];B[no];W[lp];B[lo]
;W[kp];B[eq];W[fp];B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[pf]
(;B[pg]LB[qf:A]TR[kc][pd][pj]SQ[nd]C[f:
I thought I had enough of a lead in this area to make this direct
attack.  But, maybe A would have been better.  That might have lead to
better chances for holding on to all of the right side territory.

Ok, another fundemental concept you need to know.  The triangled stones are not territory.  They are potential to be exploited.

As said earlier, attaching is not attacking at this point, it only makes white strong when it was weak.  See variant.

DB:  I think something as simple as o16 is sufficient.];W[of]
;B[og]C[DB: Again, o16 is a very big point];W[qg];B[qh];W[qe]
;B[qd];W[ng];B[ph];W[nd];B[nc];W[oc];B[od];W[mc];B[nb];W[ob]
;B[mb];W[md];B[lc];W[qb];B[rb]LB[eb:D][he:C][le:A][rg:B]TR[qb]
C[f:
I thought the corner was still mine, just that I'd need to fight a bit
for it.  But, has white fully evened up the position with the marked
stone?  Should I already be writing off the deep corner, and start
heading elsewhere with A, B, or C?  A and C both harass a little while
making territory, and B is harassing while trying to firm up the wall
protecting all of my remaining right side territory.  Or, maybe D,
because white can play at D in sente, and start to work on eye space
(as white does much later on move 127)?

DB: I think your best
option is to play as shown in the variation, then come back and play C.
C is a huge point, but you can't afford to lose the whole upper right. 
Maybe S17 is a mistake on his part....tough to tell, but after he plays
it the variation seems reasonable.];W[rc]
(;B[sc]C[Ok, see variant, but you should place yourself in these positions.]
;W[sd];B[rd];W[sb];B[qc];W[ra];B[pb];W[pa];B[pc];W[oa];B[na]
;W[qa];B[lb]C[DB:
This is a big lose for black.......losing the whole corner in gote. 
H15 is still bigger than protecting at m18 though.];W[nk];B[ol]
;W[he]C[DB:  White is VERY lucky to get this move in, but still is very attackable]
;B[rg];W[re];B[qf];W[oe];B[rf];W[ok]C[Ok,
another fundemental is don't get surrounded.  Right now, white is
unintentionally getting the center blocked off.  The reason is you are
defending oddly but that improves with time.  Always break out to the
center from a settled group.  This keeps it from being too big of a
prize.  With three corners, the top middle, and splitting the center,
you would win.]
(;B[oj]LB[pk:A]TR[qf][rf][og][pg][rg][ph][qh]SQ[pl][om][pm]
[nn][on][pn][oo][po]C[f:
I had a tough time chosing between this move and A.  With hindsight,
the more conservative A looks better.  This group is already solidly
rooted to eyespace thanks to the marked group above, and so it can
adventure into the middle, but it will be hard to get anything there. 
A would have not only protected the right side, but also the marked
area below, which I think should have been all mine.

Another
fundemental, keep connected.  Connected groups do not fight for life so
may expand with ease.  Split groups are divided efforts.

Q-9 was mandatory not conservative.  After that white must try to block you off but will fail miserably.  See variant

DB:  I agree];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn];B[po]
MA[lo][no]C[f:  Was this move premature?  Should I have waited and connected later, at r4 if necessary?

No, at your level, it kept the marked stones in play.];W[qn]
;B[rn];W[ib]C[f:
Well, I thought I had the upper side, but now it looks like I may have
given white one too many free moves up here.  Can I still claim this
territory?];B[ic]C[DB:  I think h18 might work better here.  See variation]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[gc];B[fb]MA[jb]C[f:  Oops.  Now these last two moves, maybe even last three moves, are looking pretty bad.

K-18 may work better];W[eb]
(;B[db]C[DB:  This is a big tactical mistake.  See variation.]
;W[ea]C[DB:  It still works from here.  See variation.]
(;B[da];W[dc];B[cb];W[ga];B[nm]TR[ol]C[f:
Saving the marked stone and securing a little territory.  I don't see
anything better.

Forget that lost soldier, K-18 is still strong, plus play out to the middle if anything else.

DB:  I agree much better moves....primarily saving your crippled group at the top]

;B[jj]LB[kh:A]C[f:
Too conservative?  Maybe A, which would have started a run towards the
top side, possibly saving both the center and top groups?

Well, again, avoid the whole question by saving it earlier by connecting.]

LB[fo:A]C[f:
Still perhaps not thinking very clearly.  Following white's last move,
how could this group ever find life?  Yes, I need to be agressive about
getting in to white's lower side territory, but this won't work.  Maybe
A?

missed your shot 5 moves back.

Game is over.  Hope the
review helps.  Just look up the fundementals and stick to them.  Keep
connected, know influence from territory, know thickness, know ladders
and nets, know good shape, know urgent and big moves, know when to let
go of a stone.  Not all the fundementals but this should help.]
;W[hn];B[gq]LB[hq:A]C[f:  Oops.  Walking in to this one.  Maybe I should have been one over at A?]

;W[hp];B[gs];W[gq];B[jq]LB[ir:A]TR[hr][gs]C[f:
My marked stones are too vulnerable for this.  Maybe A would have been
workable.  Anyway, that makes for 5 silly mistakes in only 7 of my
moves.  On 198 I played myself into atari, on 200 I extended a dead
group, on 202 I played myself into unavoidable atari, on 204 I extended
a dead group again, and now on 210 I've extended too far, leaving my
base open to attack.  The game looked tough before this sequence. 
After this, I probably should have resigned.];W[ir];B[hs];W[is]

This seems to be a very painful exchange for black in terms of
territory.  The upside is white is left with two near dead stones. 
However blacks stones is just as weak, making it tricky to attack.  If
the two white stones survive, the triangle stones become a bad
exchange.  Also, why play p3 at all? why not play something like M3? 
Just an idea.];B[kc]SQ[he]C[Now, this may not be the best, but
