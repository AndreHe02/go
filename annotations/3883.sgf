C[Hi,

this is a game I played today against a 2k+ on IGS. I feel that even if I wouldnt have made the mistake in the top right, I still would have lost. It was a game where I think I played right into Whites hands.

Thank you very much for looking at it.

Chris

MR: Hi Chris,

please see my comments in the game.
You asked for some meta level advice. In my opinion, your main problem is that you want to have *everything* and that you dare not to give *something* to your opponent. In go, it is always "give and take". You get influence and your opponent gets territory or the other way round. You just need to have half a point more in the end :-) 
If you feel that your opponent makes "strange moves", you do not need to "punish" them. In most cases, they are punishment on their own. Just make moves that you feel are "normal" and see how things develop.
One more thing: Do not play sequences where you can already read that they do not work for you. If you can't capture stones (like on the upper side), just leave things as they are for the moment - you might want to use the aji of the somewhat open position later on.

(;B[pj]C[MR: I feel that this move is "asking for trouble". Why place a stone in the middle of whites influence? White should seperate the two black stones and use his thickness in the bottom to chase the middle black stone.]

(;W[qk]C[Chris: This felt like a mistake to me, I wasnt sure how to punish it though. I tried to make White overconcentrated, but we ended up fighting in is area of influence (which I dont think is any good).

MR: I agree that this move looks strange. Now it becomes black who can separate the white stones (with R10).]

(;B[pk]C[MR: This looks strange to me as it allows white to "connect" with R10.]

;W[ng];B[rf];W[oe];B[nf]C[MR: This move is really strange as the ladder is favorable for white.

I think that you should be happy enough with R15 (although the whole result is still not good for black, but this is the result of Q9 and Q10).]

;W[fo];B[gp];W[el];B[cp]C[MR: Although this might be joseki locally, my feeling is that this is not the topic of the game. On the one hand, this weakens C7. On the other hand, white has started to build an impressive moyo in the center ...]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[bo];B[jo]C[Chris: I thought this might be my only chance to get an entry point in this huge area.]

;W[hp];B[iq];W[ho];B[hq];W[jn];B[ko];W[go]C[MR: This is gote for white. Now black can walk into the middle starting with L6 and hope to come back to living on the left side afterwards.]
;B[ql]C[Chris: Here I started a sequence, I missread. Is there a better chance to use the 2 white stones there?]

C[MR: You are asking for everything! On the one hand, you want to destroy the white moyo in the center, and on the other hand you want to keep every stone on the edges? This will not work in go ;-)]
;W[pn];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[om]C[Chris: Realising the errror....]
;B[ed];W[gc];B[fe]LB[cc:A][gc:78]C[Chris: I didnt want to play A obviously because I didnt like the influence white would get. So I played this, knowing there are some kind of joseki around and that this move properly separates the corner from white 78. Unfortunately I do not know any in this position. What would be a good way to work into whites moyo from this?

MR: Your move F15 is perfectly ok. It is a good move after G17 if you do not want to settle the whole area immediately and instead prefer to stay flexible. There are very many different variations, depending on the white answers. (You may want to look up some of them in your joseki dictionary.) Key continuation move for black in the upper side direction is H16. In this game, the black goal should be to get a save group looking to the outside.]
;W[de]C[Chris: After the game I checked Kogo's Joseki Dictionary but a sequence like this is not listed. I feel like I have been tricked.

MR: Yes, I haven't seen this move before either. But it should not make much difference with respect to josekis developing on the upper side compared to W D14 instead. In my opinion, black should try to find a joseki variation giving him gote and should then play a move on the left side to revitalize C7.]

;B[ge];W[ec];B[dc]C[MR: As said before, you cannot get everything! You created yourself a cut at K16, and now you try to seperate in the corner. This is asking for too much.]
;W[jd];B[jb]C[MR: ?];W[db];B[fc]C[MR: You should be able to read that you cannot capture the white stones around G17. If you did so, you should not play the following moves.]
;W[eb];B[fd];W[fb];B[ib];W[gb];B[if];W[kd];B[nc]C[MR: Did you read that this connects to the three black stones K17 etc.?]
;W[lb];B[ii]C[Chris: I thought I had to work my way in quickly.

MR: If you thought this, why did you first place the three stones K17 etc.? Also, the center is still somewhat open at L6.]
;W[eg];B[li];W[kg]C[Chris: This feels like a mistake to me. I think the shape point should be Blacks next move.

MR: Yes, in the following moves white is much too kind to you ...]

;W[ni];B[im];W[in];B[ik];W[jl];B[jm];W[fj];B[cj]C[Chris: I was trying to use this to create a second eye in sente somehow.
