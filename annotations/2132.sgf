C[Hi, my name is Dylan Carter and my friends name is Paul Brennan, Please review for both sides. Thank you in advance.

;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl]TR[kf][kg][mh][no][dp][kq]C[Dylan: It is at this point I start taking a bit of centre, In my games i do this too early sometimes, and it costs me dearly to do this.

With the white marked stones quite strong, it it very hard to make territory in the center. So it is true black should not focus on this.]

(;B[kj]LB[hd:A]TR[og][mh]C[Dylan: Somewhere around H12 better maybe?

It doesn't look like a good idear to try to make territory in the center. instead, black can use his strength in the center to  attack the two marked stones and/or to invade arround A.

not necessarily black gets horrible shape if he connects but in this case it looks like it's the only move working, so it is probably the move.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[ih];B[ij]C[Dylan: It looks bad, but i was trying to wangle some thickness

It looks like black is trying desesperatly to get back some center territory  ;-)
Black should  let it go and concentrate on someting else, since this is reinforcing white.]

Black main mistake was to want to make territory in the center, but the upper right black corner was too big as white invasion stones get captured. Black did a nice endgame too.

About the endgame, it's good if you had fun trying stuff, but I beleave this is not a good habit to play moves that are not working and loosing all ko threats... Futhermore it usually make your oponent stronger, witch removes some oportunities... 

About becoming stronger.... If you get a magic recipe, tell me! :)]
