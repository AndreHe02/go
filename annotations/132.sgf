C[It was interesting to review this game.
I think black could benefit a lot from studying som tesuji and life-and-death problems.

Black had a good game and one can perhaps say that he deserved to win. He captured a big group, but due to a black misstake white was able to rescue it. White also got away with an unreasonable invasion. Black also gave up a favourable ko-fight for no good reason.

I hope my comments can be of some value. For sure, I have learnt a lot by doing this review.

/ Tomas Boman (bom)];B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd];B[nc];W[qg]C[This is a territory oriented move. When white plays like this he typically want to seal off the corner completely at q17 very soon. In this game, I don't think it is a very good strategy since black is threatening to build a huge moyo, and if white stops that, then black can very easily steal the corner.]

(;B[kc]C[Good! But I think k16 or k17 are slightly better since they work a little bit better with the upper left. White m17 is no threat since the corner is wide open.  An invasion at r17 is another possibility.

Now, I think that white should at least play the p17-o16 exchange immediately since it makes a corner invasion a little bit more difficult, and he can claim that black has become over concentrated.
If l17 is one step further away on the other hand, then white must play q17, so black get sente if white want the corner]

C[White wins by 16.5 points. Black made several misstakes that worth more than this. For example killing the invasion on the left side would have increased black's score by 20 points.

On at least two occasions black failed to se the shortage of liberties for empty triangles (move 45 and 155). For the future:
Try to avoid making empty triangles (and other heavy shapes) if possible, and try to exploit the weaknesses when your opponent plays them.]
