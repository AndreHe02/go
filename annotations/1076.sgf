C[Dear Reviewer: My name is Alex Weldon (Xopods on IGS).  I've been playing Go for about 8 months (just teaching myself from web resources and practicing vs. my computer) and I'd estimate that I'm about 18k or so (weaker on IGS, of course).  This was a pretty good game against a stronger opponent.  I didn't see myself make any massive blunders... I seem to have lost the game mostly from a strategic perspective and, to a lesser extent, due to a few smallish tactical blunders.This game seems to me to be a good candidate for review... I expect that I can learn a lot from your comments.

J: Hi, Alex, I'll try to do my best. I'll prepend my comments with "j" (from jaime)
I've included some "free-hand" variations, please don't pay attention to the actual moves but to idea behind them.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[dd];B[qi]C[I usually tend to play the low Chinese opening.];W[dj];B[ic];W[qn];B[nq];W[qk];B[oj];W[rp];B[rq];W[qp]

;B[pi];W[ok];B[nj];W[nk];B[mk];W[ml];B[ll];W[nl];B[lj]C[This seemed to work out fairly well for me.  No doubt I could have held him a bit smaller, but overall it seemed like a pretty fair exchange of territory for influence to me.

J: I agree with you, good exchange. Now don't forget to use thick wall for influence, NOT for actual territory]
;W[mo];B[np];W[lo];B[lm];W[lq];B[mr]C[J: maybe this is the first "wrong" move; when you've a thick wall, use it to press your opponent against it. In this case, pressing him from the left (maybe J4 or similar)]
;W[lr];B[qj]C[J: this is *not* an urgent move. How many points does it deserve? Why not F3? Don't forget to take profit from your opponents' weak groups (M3 group now)]
;W[pk]
(;B[fc]C[J: good, but better on the lower side of the board]
;W[ec];B[cf]C[J: ok, but maybe the standard response (F16) was stronger here, the upper zone turning *very* black. Anyway, it's ok.]
;W[cd];B[ee]C[Closing him into the corner and strengthening my top...];W[nc];B[ld]C[J: wrong direction, IMHO. You're pressing white against your corner. The idea here should be let him live inside and small (he's played on the 3rd line, so should be easy). I'd rather play O16, or even P16]
;W[pd]C[J: see? If he makes a wall in the outside, your R11 wall will be nullified]
;B[od];W[oc];B[pe];W[qd];B[qc];W[nd];B[oe];W[qe];B[qf];W[rc]
;B[re];W[rd];B[rb];W[qb];B[pb];W[ob];B[qa];W[rf];B[rg];W[se]
;B[qg];W[sc];B[sf]C[Don't know what I was thinking...

J: yes, :-) Anyway, it's turned quite ok, but he's lived near your wall... Now you should attack the O16 group *while* making points]
;W[sg];B[sh];W[sf];B[rh];W[sb]C[J: your last chance to live dissapeared... a pity you kept playing yose moves..]
;B[ne];W[lc];B[md];W[mc];B[kc];W[oa];B[kb]C[I suspect I could have played the top right corner much better than that.
J: surely you could. This last move is not necessary, good for later. You still have plenty of room for attacking the M3 group, and a weak group to defend (C14)]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[jj]
(;B[ii]C[J: wrong direction, again. Prior to place an stone try to imagine the opponent's answer... Now it's time to make solid your territory in the upper rigth (maybe it's over-thick, but...)]
;W[ji];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh];W[li];B[lh];W[mi];B[mj];W[ij];B[hj]
C[j: you keep playing in the wrong direction: the central lower-left zone should be no problem, as you have your wall to back you up. However, you've invited white on your right-upper zone... close this zone and you'll get a good bunch of points!]
;W[hk];B[ik]C[One of the aforementioned tactical mistakes.];W[jk];B[il];W[hi];B[ih];W[gj];B[jl];W[mh]

;B[fk];W[fh];B[fg];W[gm];B[hn];W[fm];B[io];W[jp]
(;B[jo];W[ip];B[rj]C[j: why? white should not answer this stone! You should be busy trying to avoid white connection on the lower left!]
;W[rk]C[J: anyway... :-)];B[cg];W[bh]C[j: you're lucky white replies all of your moves... there's plenty of battle left on the lower side. White has to live, and you could make some big influence while attacking, for a latter invasion / reduction of the lower left]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[ho]C[J: a pity, now it's too late];B[jn]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[gn];B[fb];W[eb];B[ed];W[ac];B[de];W[cb];B[ce]
;W[ea];B[fa]C[j: NO! You must do something with the lower left corner. It's a HUGE white territory!]
;W[db]C[Top left worked out well for me];B[cq]C[J: ok, albeit a little bit too late];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[br];W[fq]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[bk];B[bp]C[J: no need to];W[gg]
C[Obviously the weakness left here was another tactical blunder, but I'm not sure at what stage I should have prevented it.
J: that's difficult, it has to do with earlier stages of the game. You should have closed a little bit more from the inside. Also, you could have defended it instead of, for example, playing F19... anyway, it's a fair problem]
;B[gf];W[eg];B[dg];W[ff];B[ge];W[fe];B[fd];W[of];B[pf]C[J: no, you don't need to connect that, both groups are ok, better close him]
;W[mf];B[me];W[lg];B[lf];W[ng];B[kg];W[mg]C[Another small loss due to bad tactics and leaving weaknesses.
J: don't be too worried about that, this kind of things are the easiest to learn, as they directly *hurt* :-)]
;B[jf];W[lb];B[la];W[pa];B[ma];W[ds];B[cr];W[kk];B[lk];W[mq]
;B[nr];W[kl];B[km];W[sq];B[sr];W[sp];B[rr];W[gd]C[And here he goes a third time...];B[hd]C[j: this time you could save it. Just play H14 and you should have no problem. Your F19 group if big and full of liberties]
;W[hf];B[he];W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[jg];W[gl];B[ef];W[fg];B[bg]

;W[sl];B[sj];W[rm];B[na];W[qb];B[nb];W[mb];B[ka];W[pc];B[mp]
;W[lp];B[nf];W[hj];B[kj];W[pr]C[I found this move a little condescending.  No way that group is dying.
J: yes, there's some kind of player who enjoys trying to kill *everything*. Too bad IMHO]
;B[pq];W[or];B[rs]C[That's it.  Final result: White wins by 44.5 points.  Not a slaughter, and pretty good considering the difference in our levels.  My specific questions: 1) how could I have played better to prevent those three small tactical losses, 2) how could I have held white smaller in the top and middle right? and 3) the game was obviously not lost on tactics alone... how could my strategy have been better?

J: I hope I've answered most of the questions; now I'm going back to make some variations (very fast-paced, just for you to see the difference). Contact me if you have any doubts.
Also, I believe you should concentrate on strategy (opening and middle game); maybe some books will help you a lot. Good luck!]

(;B[ip]C[j: you don't need to connect till he escapes atari]

;W[gq];B[fq];W[gp];B[er];W[hs];B[fs]C[j: this last few moves maybe too "free" but probably you could live.]

(;B[ki]C[j: your attack finished ok, as you built a big zone on the upper right; anyhow, i'd attacked from here...]

;W[ii];B[hl]C[J... maybe entering the lower side. Note you could connect with the upper left *or* right group, so you're strong here, and his H13 group is not at all near alive]
