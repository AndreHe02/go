C[This was a rather interesting game I played on DashBaduk recently.  We were both rated 10k and there was no komi.

I played white stones.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time...

Result: Jigo


This was a fighting game with some good moves and some bad moves for both sides. It is some balance in your game, keep it this way, I refered to  attack-defence here.
If you want my advices to improve your strenght, here it is:
Play and play and play again :)
Belive me this is the best option you have, second is GTL of course ;)
If you have other questions about the game or about my comments please feel free t ask me if you see me online on KGS, my nuckname there is RoninRo.]

Now you have sente and must do something with left side])

But black end in sente now and catch another move to strenghten his left side.
So I think it`s better to don`t move right now at s10 and switch the play to the left side]
