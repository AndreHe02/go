C[brian81 [?\]: hi ZackRau [?\]: hi

SC: I will preface my comments with my initials.  BTW, I tend to use masculine pronouns since I don't actually know anyone's gender.]
;B[pd]C[I think if white had not given up black would have had a much harder time than white thought.

I was hoping you could rank black. White resigned after he believed that Black could take the middle and expand from there.

SC:  I agree that White resigned much too soon.  At the time White resigned, I would rather be playing White than the Black.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[SC:  This is a fairly standard start.  Black has played on the 4x4 point in both of his corners.  This implies that Black plans to play a game focused on building influence and attacking.  Black's later play doesn't follow this idea, however.  In retrospect, Black should have started out playing on 3x4 points.]
;B[nc]TR[pj][fq][cn][de]SQ[qd][oc]C[SC:  This is not good.  To enclose the corner well, the black stones would both have to be shifted one space to the right to the spaces marked with squares.  With the current stone positions, white could still invade at the 3x3 point.  So, this stone does not really secure the corner and does not really secure much of the side either.  If Black plans to play this way, he should start on a 3x4 point with his first move.  Then he can make a better corner enclosure with his next move in that corner.  Currently, the triangles are all better moves for black.]
;W[dj]C[SC:  This is worth much more than Black's last move.]
;B[qn]TR[de][pj][fq][gd]C[SC:  Same comments as move 5.  The triangles are all better choices for Black.  You don't want to concentrate all of your stones in one area during the opening.]
;W[lp]SQ[iq]C[SC:  This is a bit too close to Black.  White should expect Black to respond with a pincer around the square.]

(;B[oq]TR[rs][ss][sr][sq][sp][rp][rq][rr][qs][qr][qq][so][ro]
[qo][qp][ps][pr][pq]SQ[iq]C[SC:  This is way to passive.  Black has now used three moves and finally has the lower right corner secure.  This corner is worth at most 18 points (marked by triangles).  White has been making moves worth more than 6 points each, however.  Black should pincer around J3.  See the variation.]
;W[ip]C[SC:  Now white has played to prevent a black invasion around J3.  The main problem with White's position is that almost all of his stones are on the fourth line.  This makes his position easier to invade.  For the opening, it is best to have about half of your stones on the fourth line and about half on the third line.]

(;B[ld]TR[fd][de][cq][pi]C[I was wondering if black is playing too defensive? (I'm black btw.)

SC:  This is bad.  It is much too small for the opening.  The triangles are all better choices.  You will note that I am now suggesting a 3x3 point invasion in the lower left.  This is the first time I have suggested it.  This reflects the growing strength of White's Moyo in the lower left.  Black moves around F3 and C6 are now un-workable.  The corner invasion is less desirable in general because White will build a strong outward facing wall as he contains the invasion.  Now, however, this wall will not be much stronger than White already is, so the invasion makes more sense for black.  See variation.]
;W[id];B[kc]C[SC:  This is another bad move.];W[qj]TR[ic][cq]
[cm][cf]C[The next series of moves is a fight over the middle. and i'm not sure if my moves were too passive at the beginning. regardless my opponent lets me take the area.

SC:  This is not a bad move for white.  However, since white is ahead by a large margin he can afford to secure what he already has.  Thus , the triangles would all be good choices for white. If white really wants to invade, I would play one space up at R11 since that is more equal distance between black's strong groups.]
;B[pf]TR[cq][fc][de]C[SC:  Black should probably ignore this invasion by white and play his own invasion now.  The area White invaded isn't really black territory  anyway.  The triangles are still good moves for Black.  An important concept is to look for the best move on the whole board.  You don't always have to play close to your oponent's last stone.]
;W[qg]C[SC:  Good, white needs to establish a base on the right side to live.]

(;B[pg]C[SC:  This implies that black will attack and try to kill white. Normally, I would call this too aggressive.  However, black manages to kill white, so apparently it isn't too aggressive for this situation.  Normally, I would say black should play to contain white and build his own territory at the same time.  See variation.]
;W[qh];B[qf]C[SC:  Good, this keeps white out of the upper right corner.]

(;W[rf]C[SC: This is bad because it is Gote.  Normally, black would answer at S15 then white has to play S13 in Gote.  A better choice is for white to play S13 here.  Black should then respond at S14 and white keeps Sente.  See variation.]
;B[pl]C[SC:  Black should block at S15.]
(;W[qk]C[SC:  White should invade the upper right corner since black failed to guard it.  See variation.]
;B[ql];W[rl]C[SC:  again white plays a Gote move.  S9 makes an empty triangle, but it is still a better move than this one is.]
;B[re];W[rh]C[SC:  White should just connect solidly at S13.  This is probably the point where white's group begins to die.]
;B[sf];W[rg]TR[rm]C[SC:  White should just sacrifice this stone and expand downward at the triangle.  White now has really bad shape here.  In general, bad shape means you have been making bad moves.]
;B[sg]C[SC:  This is rather small.  Black should play at S7 to contain white.]
;W[sh];B[se];W[qi]C[SC:  Again, white should extend downwards now.  Black can't cut here so white doesn't need to defend here now.  If white really has to play here, Q11 makes better eye shape for this group.]
;B[rm];W[sl]C[SC:  White should just connect at S9.];B[sm];W[rk]
;B[sj]C[SC:  This is probably the best move of the game for Black.  This play turns white's space into one big eye instead of the two eyes needed for life.  White now has no hope to live on the side and must run into the center to save this group.  Black can expect to build nice walls as he chases white into the center.]
;W[ph]SQ[oj][oi]C[I thought that was good for black?

SC:  Black has done well by allowing white only one eye here. This move for white is too tentative.  He needs to flee quickly into the center.  Either of the squares is better.]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[pj]C[SC:  This is good.];W[pk]SQ[pi]C[SC:  White should just connect at the square.]
;B[oj];W[og]C[SC:  Again just connect at Q11.];B[nh];W[of]C[SC:  This is really bad for white.  He needs to focus on running his side group out into the center.  This move doesn't help accomplish this.]
;B[oe]C[SC:  Just connecting at Q15 is better.];W[qe]C[ here is where i first noticed those stones in trouble. i was worried as to if i could save them or not.

SC:  Assuming good play by black they are OK.];B[pe];W[qd];B[rd]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb]C[SC:  If White plays at S18, Black can Atari at R18.  Black can then capture white in a ladder going towards P19.]
;B[rb];W[ra]C[SC:  Now white has a group of 4 stones with 3 liberties and black has a group of 7 stones with 3 liberties.  Since it is black's move, he should win the capture race.]
;B[sc]C[SC:  White still has 3 liberties but black is now down to 2 liberties since he filled in one.  Perhaps black felt he should make an eye.  However, there is no way to make two eyes and making just one eye doesn't make life.]

(;W[sa]C[SC:  See variation for a better white response.  White should try to increase his liberties by expanding out to the left.]
;B[pa]C[SC:  Q18 is better.  See next move.]
(;W[qa]C[ white realized that he was in trouble. but wouldnt it have been better for white to cut black earlier?

SC:  White never really had a chance to capture black here (assuming black plays well).  Since this is a high kyu game, it is probably worth it for white to try, however.  If White had cut one move earlier, Black would have been able to capture white in a ladder.

SC:  Right now white should play at Q18 to capitalize on black bad move at Q19.  See variation.]
;B[pb];W[ni];B[nj]C[Though this game didnt come to any 'complete' conclusions. It went long enough - i hope - to be reviewed. I know we both went for a combined time of about 50 minutes]
;W[lf]C[SC:  White has still not saved his right side group and keeps playing elsewhere.  This is bad.]
;B[nf]C[ again i think i'm playing too passive here. but it's hard to for me to tell.

SC:  Right now this is OK.  Black is trying to kill white by cutting him off from the center.]
;W[mg];B[ng]C[brian81 [?\]: 2 days on the 19x19 board brian81 [?\]: 2 weeks overall
ZackRau [?\]: i see 
ZackRau [?\]: yeah about as long as me.];W[mh]C[SC:  Bad, white should play at N11.]
;B[mi]C[brian81 [?\]: i played you before 
ZackRau [?\]: really? 
ZackRau [?\]: when?

SC:  Good, this cuts white off and should finally kill the large white group on the side.]
;W[mj];B[pi]C[SC:  Now white wishes he had connected at Q11 several moves ago.]
;W[li];B[ni];W[lj]TR[cq][ce][gc]C[SC:  Now that black has killed the large white group, he should turn his attention to invading on the left side.  The triangles are all good ideas.]
;B[me]C[SC:  Much too small.];W[nn]C[SC:  White should defend against invasions on the left side. He is ahead and can afford to secure what he has.]
;B[om];W[nl];B[ol];W[ll]C[it looks here that it would be hard to invade whites territory... i was thinking maybe expanding diagnol from thirteen or something in the top middle. (granted i didnt get to do this.)

SC:  Expanding in from around L15 is a reduction.  This situation calls for an actual invasion along the left side.  Invading along the left side seems very far away from any of your stones.  However, it is much easier to live on the side, so you are better invading at C14 than playing closer to your stones in the center.]

(;B[mq]C[SC:  OK locally, but too small over all.  See variation.]
;W[lq];B[lr]C[SC:  This is Gote.  Black wants to keep Sente and attack White.]
;W[kr];B[mp];W[mo]C[if white moved right of 83 i think that would have been a problem.

SC:  Yes, it would reduce your corner more.];B[mr];W[ib]C[88 spoiled my plans of going around into whites territory.

SC:  J17 would be more solid and still prevent black from going around.]
;B[nm];W[mm];B[no]C[SC:  Black is securing his area on the right with endgame moves. This is still the midgame and time for invasions however.  If black succeeds in his goal of securing all of the territory to the right of line N or O he will lose by  50 points or so.  Thus, this is a bad strategy.  So, find a new strategy.]
;W[mn];B[jc];W[ic];B[je]C[was thinking of expanding somewhere. perhaps going around the large group there or going down some.

SC:  This is better, but still not the invasion that is called for.]
;W[if];B[kf]C[i chose to go down :)];W[kg];B[ie];W[he];B[jg]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[ih];B[kh];W[lg]C[SC:  Bad, white should connect at M12 and sacrifice the stone at L13.]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[ks]C[here i was buying time while i was trying to find a way to save those three stones there.

SC:  If you are really desperate for time, this makes sense. Otherwise, you could probably think better by just pausing to contemplate.]
;W[js];B[ls];W[jr];B[mk]C[again looking for a way in the middle.]
;W[nk];B[ok]C[SC:  Good, this keeps white from saving the side group.]
;W[ml]C[i didnt want to make that move leaving the black stone stranded there.]
;B[ki];W[kj]C[here is where i decided what i wanted to do.]
;B[ii];W[jj]C[i was planning on him moving there.];B[ig]C[here is where white resigned. I think his best move would have been to stop me from taking the two stones: 96 and 102. by playing to the left. then i would kill the remaining stone in atari. if white let me i would have moved to the right of black 105 and cute off that group of 5 white stones. then proceeded to try and gain territory from there. however, white still has a great deal more than I had. In any case i'm not sure how the conclusion would have been but i think black had just as much of a chance as white did.

SC:  White is ahead at this time.  So, I would rather be White right now.  Particularly since Black shows no signs of  invading the left side.  Black's main problem was playing too small in the opening.  This allowed White to build a large potential territory while black had only two small corners.  Since move 15 Black has been trying to catch up and actually doing a rather good job of it.  White did well in the opening, but didn't manage the invasion of the right side well.
SC:  Black needs to study the opening and White needs to study middle game fighting.]

If you are not sure about the Seki, lay this out on a board and play through it until you see that whoever plays on T18 first dies.  R19 is a false eye.  Thus, neither will play there and both are alive in Seki.  This is bad for black since he should have been able to kill white.]

;W[pj];B[rh];W[ph];B[om];W[nl]C[SC:  white invades the upper right corner and, after sacrificing some stones, escapes out into the center with his right side group.  Remember, an invasion can succeed if you live.  It can also succeed if you escape into the center after reducing your opponent's territory.  Here we have examples of both types of success.  Also, note how many stones I was willing to sacrifice to save the main group of stones.  When you have a weak group, a sacrifice can be a good strategy to save it.]
