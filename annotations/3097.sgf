C[Hi. This is a game played between me and my friend. We both dont know how to play very well but we are trying to learn. Could you please comment on where better moves would be for both players?

Thank you very much! ^_^

Calvin: I will try.  Remember that I am still a weak player myself, and it is hard even for very strong players to make definitive comments.   I am not going to attempt comment on every move; instead, I'll just point out common habits and some good things to think about during to the game.]
;B[pp]LB[pd:A][qd:B][qc:C][qe:D][pe:E][qq:X]C[As a point of etiquette, the first move for black should be near his opponent's left side.  

In Internet Go, there is a convention that this means the upper right hand corner.  The most common moves are at A-E, with A and B dominating 20th century Go.  The most important thing to understand about this move is that it does not take any territory.  Indeed, it is possible for white to invade at X and black will have no territory.  The reason it is okay to play at the 4-4 point is that the influence that is built if white invades can often be worth more than the territory white makes when invading.  This depends on the outside position.

So this move is for developing quickly (because it is symmetrical with respect to a diagonal across the board) and to support large frameworks and fighting.]
;W[dd];B[eq];W[pd];B[qf]SQ[pp][eq]LB[cf:A][cp:B]C[So far, so good.  Each player has played one move in an empty corner, which is recommended for beginners.  The three marked black stones are working well together.  Black can also consider approaching from the other side at A or enclosing the lower left corner by making a shimari at B.]
;W[gf]LB[nc:A][do:B]SQ[pd][dd]C[This is the first questionable move.  At this point I'd like to introduce the "three questions" which you should ask yourself before every move.

1. Do I have a weak group?  If so, protect it.
2. Does my opponent have a weak group?  If so, attack it.
3. If there are no weak groups on the board, find the biggest point left and play it.

As a beginner, it is hard to tell which groups are weak and which are strong, but it is important to start thinking about it right away.  For now, I'd say a good rule of thumb if group is weak if it is not yet alive and can be surrounded by the opponent's next move.

Black 5 is threatening to start surrounding white by playing somewhere near A.  If white is comfortable defending the marked stone (Q16) if black plays A, then he can play elsewhere.  So two good options for white are to play at A himself, following the proverb: 

Proverb: your opponent's good move is often your good move.

White 6 is not an urgent point or a big point.   

Proverb: "The corner is gold, the side is silver, the center is grass."

White 6 occupies a point nearer the center, but there are still big open areas near the corners and sides.  It also has a poor relationship with the marked white stone.

The largest point for white other than defending the marked stone is probably near B.]
;B[oe]LB[nc:A]SQ[pd]C[As I mentioned in my previous comment, a positive strategy to punish White 6 should be to play a double approach at A.  This move is not as good because it touches the marked stone.  Go is strange.  Unlike, say, boxing, where contacting your opponent is the key part of an attack, in Go the opposite is often true---contacting your opponent makes him stronger, and contact moves are used for defense, not offense.  For attack, the key principle is to surround.  See variation.]

(;W[fp]LB[od:A][do:B][nc:C]TR[eq]C[I mentioned in the variation that white should play at A to strengthen his stone and start making fourth-line territory.  Instead, White 8 ignores black and makes a contact play in the lower left.   Contact plays are used mostly for defense in areas of the opponent's strength.  It is usually bad to ignore a contact play to an isolated stone.

In this position, it looks like white is offering a trade: "Hey, black.  I'll sacrifice the Q17 stone and let you take a big corner, if you just let me play two moves in a row in the lower left."   This would not be a good trade for white, because it is not possible for white to kill the marked black stone even if he gets a second move in the lower left.  On the other hand, there is a good chance his Q16 stone will die or at least come under serious attack if black plays A or C.

White 8, a fourth-line angle play against a third-line stone, is called a "shoulder hit."  This move sometimes good when it is used to reduce a large territorial framework.   However, the timing is a little off here for that.  For white, it is bigger take a point like B near the corner to start building his own territorial framework.

But white has no time for either move.  'A' is urgent.];B[ep]
LB[od:A][fq:B]C[This is a good move for black.  Because there are outstanding contact fights on the board, I think that the main choices for black are A, B, and Black 9.   I'd prefer A.]
;W[fo]C[White 10 is the usual shape after a shoulder hit.]
(;B[en]LB[dn:A][eo:B]C[Black 11 shows good idea of trying to run ahead of white.   However, it's a little optimistic to try to make territory on the fifth line.  A is enough, and is safer.]
;W[eo]C[It is a basic instinict to try to push through gaps like this.  Whether it is good depends on the quality of the tactical follow-up.]
;B[do];W[em]LB[dn:A][dp:B][fn:C]C[Usually, when white pushes through like this, it is natural to consider cutting with A or B.   White 14 looks like a clamp tesuji, but it is only good when A and C and both good moves.]

(;B[fn]LB[dm:A]C[Black shows good fighting spirit by splitting white.   Black can also consider protecting one of his cuts by playing at A.  See variation.]
;W[gn];B[fc]LB[fm:A][dm:B]C[This invasion, while at a nice point, leaves a hot battlefield behind.   Black should continue with his plan to split white by playing at A.   A more peaceful strategy would be to connect at B.]

(;W[gm]LB[fm:A]C[White should play the atari at A first and then connect at 18.  This would leave fewer defects.]
;B[go]LB[dm:A]C[This is an overplay.   It is now urgent for black to protect the cut at A.]
;W[dn]C[White has done very well in the lower right.];B[ce]
SQ[fc][do][ep][eq]LB[cn:A]C[Black is making another contact move, which helps white.  Black is also splitting himself, and now has three weak groups on the board.   But it is urgent for black to save his corner by playing something like A.

Both players in this game neglect to defend weak groups.  Remember: if a group can be surrounded, consider it weak for now.]
;W[ne]LB[od:A][cd:B]C[Locally, it is better to play at A.  This move invites black to split white by playing at A himself.   But I think B is a pretty big move, splitting black and preparing to make some territory in the upper left.

It is very important in Go to stay connected.];B[ch]TR[ce]LB[od:A]
[cn:B]C[Black decides to defened his marked stone by making a base.    A is a bigger move, but I think B is the most urgent spot for black, or else his corner can be taken.  It is important to defend the biggest weak group.]
;W[fd];B[ec];W[co]LB[ed:A][od:B]C[Proverb: "Even a moron connects a peep."   (Yes, that actually is the proverb.)

Black 25 is a peep, and connecting at A would be good.   Similarly, connecting at B is good.  It is a basic principle to stay connected.]

(;B[ck]LB[cq:B][fq:A]C[Black can probably salvage something by forcing at A and then playing something ilke B.   See variation.]
;W[of]SQ[oe]LB[od:A]C[White should still connect at A.  Connect first, then worry about cutting your opponent.]
;B[pe]LB[od:A][nf:B]C[For white, this is like: "Well, I tried to capture black's stone, but he saw through my plan and connected."    White is in a mess in the upper right now, because he has two cutting points at A and B and black has no defects locally.]
;W[pf]C[White seems to be continuing with his previous plan.   Let us see if black sees through it again.]
;B[qd]LB[qe:A][od:B]C[...and black does!];W[qc]LB[od:A]C[White has three cutting points now, and black is solidly connected.  White should connect one cutting point by starting at A.]
;B[od]C[A natural move, splitting white.   Good.];W[pc];B[rd]
;W[oc]LB[nb:A]C[White might be better off sliding to A immediately.]
;B[nd]C[Good.  Keep white split.];W[nc]C[Good.];B[md]LB[nf:A]
SQ[ne]TR[of][pf]C[Good.   Black can also consider the atari at A, threatening to capture either the white stone at O15 or the two white stones at P14 and Q14.]
;W[ng]LB[lb:A][mf:B]C[Defending the cutting point is good, although B is better shape.  White might also slide to A if he is not sure about the life-and-death situation in corner.]
;B[me]LB[mf:A]C[It is better for black to save this atari for later, as a ko threat.   It does force white into a bad shape, though.   This is why white 40 would be better at A.]
;W[nf]LB[og:A]C[White's shape is bad now, because of the "empty" triangle at A.  There are five white stones here, and not much to show for it.  This group is in danger of becoming "heavy" -- easy to attack, hard to sacrifice.  In fact, it is telling that white loses these stones in the endgame.]
;B[qh];W[mf]LB[oi:A][oj:B][ni:C]C[White cannot hope to hurt black by filling in liberties---black is too strong here.  If white wants to protect his heavy group, he should jump to A or B or C.  I'm sure which is best.

When one has a weak group, a basic principle is to run.];B[pg]
LB[cb:A][ed:B]SQ[ec][fc]C[This just fills in a white liberty.   I think it might be a good idea for black to slide at A now, to protect his two marked stones and threaten to cut at B.]
;W[df]SQ[dd][gf][fd]TR[ce]LB[ed:A][dc:B]C[The four white stones would make an ideal "light" shape, if only the marked black stone weren't already there :-)   It is better for white to just connect at A here.   If white does that he can later play at B to cut the black stones off from the corner.]
;B[cf]
(;W[oo]LB[qq:A][nq:B]SQ[gm][gn][fo][eo][fp]C[This shoulder hit is bad.   White should preserve the opportunity to invade at A later.  If white wants to play here, I think B is the move.   He may be able to use the marked stones to help.

Here I would like to remind white of my previous comment that it is possible to invade at A.  Therefore, neither player should think of the lower left corner as black's territory.  It could easily be white's.  See variation.]
;B[po]LB[qn:A][op:B][nq:C]C[This move is natural.   B is the other direction.   A and C are also possible because white can't push through and cut.]
;W[on];B[qm]LB[qq:A][nq:B]C[White can no longer invade at A easily.   This one reason P5 was bad.   Black can also play 51 at B, which would be a common shape.  R7 emphasizes the right side more, and black already has a low, strong position on that side, so we Go players say that that's the "uninteresting side."   But this is a subtle point.  Black 51 is pretty good here.]
;W[np]LB[nq:A]C[This move is somewhat misplaced, and doesn't have a good follow-up.  Would black play here himself?  No.  Black would slide to A.  A is also an okay move for white.]
;B[op]SQ[go]C[This move is what we call an "aji keshi".   That's bad.

First of all, it helps white get stronger.  But more importantly,  if white gets stronger here, it becomes harder for black to use the marked stone, which is not yet dead.  (As you become stronger, you'll realize that stones like G5 can be very useful.)   Black doesn't gain much more territory in the corner by playing here, but he increases the chances that white will be able to make territory on the lower side.]
;W[mn]LB[nq:A][lb:B][ed:C]C[Locally, white should play at A.   Black A is a big endgame move.  However, if I were white, I'd still be worried about the groups at the top, so something like C or B might be better.]
;B[cn]C[This move accomplishes nothing.];W[dm]LB[dp:A]C[It is probably better for white to just capture at A.]
;B[om]C[This move doesn't threaten white much, and it is not necessary to defend here.]
;W[dp]C[This is what we call a "honte" move.  It is slow, but good.   Black has much less potential in the corner now.   However, white should also consider the territorial balance now.   White's investment seems to be mostly in the center, where it is hard to make territory.  Black has real territory on the right and left sides.   White must make enough territory on the lower side and center to catch up.]
;B[pn];W[mp]LB[ho:A][nq:B]C[B would be better that White 60 for endgame purposes, but I think now white should play at A and capture the black stone in a ladder.  This would remove the remaining aji black has on the lower side.]
;B[mm]SQ[mn][on][oo][np][mp]TR[ec][fc]LB[gd:A][nm:B]C[The marked white shape is very strong.  It is hard for black to do anything to it.  In any case, the correct shape would be at B.  At  61, white can push through at B and create two cutting points, which is not good for black.

Black should ask the first question: "Do I have a weak group?"  The groups on the right side and left side are strong.  The lower left corner has some scattered stones that have some aji, but are mostly dead.  Black's triangled group at the top is not dead, and has some potential, because the white group nearby is a little thin.   I think the player who gets to play at A first has an advantage at the top, so I think it is time for black to play there.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[lm];W[ml];B[ll];W[mk];B[mo]SQ[ll][lm][mm]
LB[im:A][ho:B]C[This move is interesting, aiming at a squeeze.]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[no]C[It's good to practice squeezing techniques like this, but here I don't think it accomplishes much here.]
;B[qj]LB[nk:A]C[If black wants to defend this side, it is probably better to play at A.]
;W[ol];B[nk]SQ[om]C[The correct stone to save.  I commend this choice.  The marked stone has little value, because black can use these cutting stones.]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[pm];B[pl];W[om];B[lp]LB[pk:A]C[A wasted move.   Note that white can play another double atari at A.]
;W[ko];B[jc]SQ[ll][lm][ln][mm]LB[lk:A][il:B]C[This is not a good time to leave the fight.    Black's marked stones are heavy and need help.  I would start with the atari at A and then jump near B.   Also, black 83 is too far away from the two black stones at E17 and F17 to be of much help.]
;W[lk]SQ[mk][ml][ll][lm][ln][mm]C[This is a good move.  Previously, the two marked white stones were in danger if being captured in a ladder if black ever got a ladder breaker in.  More importantly, the marked black stones are now in serious trouble.]
;B[km]LB[kl:A][kn:B]C[It is hard for black to find the right move, but I don't think this can be it.  This shape makes two empty triangles at A and B, and this is quite bad.  Black is surrounded and has only three liberties.   He still might have to play at A and make one empty triangle, but to me it looks like saving these stones is hard.]

C[These stones have very little hope.];W[ni];B[nh];W[oi];B[pi]
;W[oh];B[mh];W[mg]LB[lf:A]C[This is a bad shape for white.   White should move out at A.]
;B[og]SQ[mf][mg][ng][nf][ne][of][pf]C[Good move, black.   The marked white stones now only have two liberties.]
;W[pk]LB[lh:A][ph:B]SQ[mf][mg][ng][pf][of][ne][nf]C[White doesn't have time for this forcing move.  White must play at A, forcing black to capture at B, in order to protect has marked stones.]
;B[pj];W[ql]LB[lh:A]C[It would have still been possible for white to play at A.]
;B[lg]C[Now white's stones are captured.];W[lf]C[This doesn't work.]
;B[kf];W[lh]C[White should avoid this type of move, hoping that black won't see the atari.]
;B[le];W[ng]C[Suicide.  Black doesn't even have to answer.]
;B[mg]LB[ph:A]C[Black doesn't have to answer.  If white plays at N13, black can simply capture at  A.]
;W[ik];B[nf]C[Unnecessary.];W[jj]C[Also unnecessary.];B[hc]
SQ[jc]LB[mb:A][rm:B]C[Now we see why the marked stone was misplaced.  If black feels the need to add a stone here, it's means that K17 should have been playd at H17 to begin with.   For endgame moves, A and B are big.]
;W[dh]LB[rc:A]C[White may have to play at A now.];B[ci]LB[di:A]
C[Locally it is better for black to hane at A, but the moves I mentioned earlier are still bigger.]
;W[di];B[cg]LB[dg:A]C[This move is not necessary now.   When black plays here eventually, he should play at A.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[dl]LB[cm:A]C[Better to capture the black stone at A.]

;W[ih]LB[rc:A][rm:B][dc:C][cd:D]C[The same advice goes for white:  A, B, C, D are all bigger.  I am not certain about the order, but the point is to finish up the edges first.  This is where the most territory can be made or lost.]

To summarize:

1. Remember the three questions.  Consider them at every move:
 a. Do I have a weak group?  Protect it?
 b. Does my opponent have a weak group?  Attack it.
 c. If there are no weak groups, take a big point.

2. Stay connected.
3. Contact moves are for defense, not attack.

There is a proverb which goes something like this: "The third line is the line of territory, the second line is the line of defeat, the fourth line is the line of victory."   It is good to force your opponent to crawl on the second line.  It is sometimes okay to force him along the third line, depending on the whole board position.
