hi,
i am intrested mainly in strategic mistakes i have done and mistakes in the di
rection of play(i played white)];B[qd]C[grrr [8k\]: have a good game]

(;W[jc]TR[oc]C[where is the biggest point on the board?

Comment: Here, since P17 is low, B has no aim at the upper side. Therefore, it
 is better to play elsewhere. Moreover, remember not to play to close from str
ength :) This implies to play in the biggest zone. I would play one of the var
iations.];B[pj]
(;W[np]C[is this a good aproach move?

Comment: I'd rather extend on the hoshi. Because of the shimari, B is very str
ong on this side, so let him repair his weaknesses himself :)]

(;B[lp]C[Comment: This pincer looks contradictory to me. That is, contradictory w/ the hoshi.]
;W[nn]C[Comment: to me, it is a little bit annoying to leave the connection to black.]

Comment: Indeed :) (see variation)]

;B[qq]
(;W[nr]C[Comment: To me, the capture is rather small compared to a good use of your influence.]
;B[jp]TR[lp]C[Comment: The marked stone is very light, so B should not extend from it.]

(;W[fp]C[Comment: tsuke is bad here (see move 22+actual game). I'd advise again to play away from strength :) However, the game result is not that bad.]

(;W[cl]C[this moves attacks from the thickness side and not towards it but b could
 have slided to w territory so i felt the gain in territory is more importent

Comment: F16 is the move, i think. Please keep in mind that you have to strengthen your groups before attacking :)]
