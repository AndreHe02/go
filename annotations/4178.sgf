Hello, Thanks in advance for the review.  I'm playing as white here.  KGS rank 17kyu.  This game was what I would consider smooth playing except for midgame.  Please let me know what part of my game needs the most help and what parts, if any, are fine.  I've left comments within.

Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm about 5k AGA.  If you have any questions, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com]

This probably isn't a very good move.  This will make Black stronger, and not do too much for you.  When you're strong in an area, it's usually better to attack from a distance.  See variation.]

The main problem you had in this game is that Black invaded your area twice, and you let the groups connect and become strong.  When you invaded his area, he kept your group relatively weak until late in the game.  Having your group weak at the top allowed the territory on the right to become too large.

From the late midgame to the end, both players were taking points in the middle that weren't worth very much.  Usually the big endgame moves are around the edges of the board.

The mistake in the top left is probably what lost the game for you.  When you realize that something bad is about to happen, try to figure out a way to minimize the damage.  In this case, giving up three stones would probably have been the best you could do.  It's hard to let your opponent capture stones, but as you get stronger, you'll start to do it more and more.  The three stones that I suggested you sacrifice weren't important - they only represent 6 points.  Stones are much more important when they're doing something useful - like keeping two groups apart that aren't alive yet.]
