C[Joonas Tyystjärvi: I played this game in a bar some time ago (I'm replaying from memory, so there may be very small mistakes in the move order). I've placed some questions in the places that I was the most unsure of. Thank you for reviewing this.]
;B[oe];W[ec];B[op];W[co];B[ep]LB[qe:B][dq:A]C[JT: Is this approach good? I also considered A and B.

I the move you did best.  Your other two stones aim at influence and this one does the same.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[dp];B[eo];W[dm];B[jp];W[pc]LB[qd:A][qe:B]C[JT: how should black answer this move? I considered A, but didn't see a good continuation, and B seemed somewhat slack.]

(;B[oc];W[pd]LB[pe:A]C[Even now its best to change direction with A]

(;B[od];W[qf];B[qe];W[pe];B[pf]LB[re:1][rf:3][pg:4][qg:2]C[All pro games on gobase 2 continuted W1, B2, W3, B4]
;W[qg]LB[rd:A]C[I wonder if A works?  It is intresting to try out on a board.]
;B[pb];W[rd];B[rc];W[qd];B[qc];W[re]TR[ec]C[JT: the result seems good for white to me - the triangled stone makes it difficult for black to develop on the upper side and white has gotten a strong group into a previously strong black area.]

(;B[jc]LB[cd:B][qp:A]C[JT: I played a low extension to protect against the cuts in the upper right.

I might like A better but your move looks ok.  You also should consider B.  instead of this.  You can sack two stones in the corner if need be.   The game has the positive of keeping you strong though.]
;W[cd]
(;B[ci]LB[di:A]C[JT: is this too early or in the wrong place? A seemed very good for white.]

(;W[pp];B[pq];W[oq];B[qq];W[nq];B[oo];W[jr]
(;B[lr]C[JT: is this wrong already? I didn't really consider any options here.

probably no need to start this chaos];W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[mq]
;W[lp];B[mr];W[ip];B[jo];W[io]
(;B[mp]C[JT: this seemed to be a mistake.

certainly this isnt needed];W[fn]C[JT: is there any simple compromise that black could take now?]

it seems to me this should work out ok.];W[dg];B[df];W[cg];B[eg]

No i think you can do it.  You need to play A in your squeeze to make more eye shape though.]

Im not so sure about that.   Whites next move kills it anyway.]
