C[Claude> Hi. I lost this game by about twenty points. Even if I spotted some of my mistakes, I'm sure I missed a lot of them.]

;B[cc];W[fd];B[gc];W[dj];B[gd]C[Claude> maybe the right side is already more important... but white answered.

It may indeed be a little early for this];W[ge];B[po]LB[lp:A]
[kq:B][lq:C][mq:D]C[Personally I am not a big fan of this move in this kind of situation.
I think a pincer would be more interesting];W[lq];B[qg];W[nc]
;B[kc]C[Claude> Is it better to invade white moyo, with C3 or F3?

I like this move, attacking the white stone while making territory. You still have plenty of options to invade later]
;W[co]C[Claude> Here I felt already a little bit late... White already has a stone in my territory whereas I still have to invade. Hey! How comes it looks like I'm one move behind?

Black has more secured territory though, white has mostly potential]

(;B[pc];W[kd];B[jc];W[ld];B[ie]LB[ne:A]C[This move doesn't do much for you
A threatens a Cut while at the same time building strength of corner and increases potential of the side.]

;W[nf];B[oh];W[mh];B[me]C[Claude> This whole sequence is not very good since I just reinforce white. I had read a cut but it just doesn't work...]

There is aji but cannot do anything with this right now]

Doesn't seem so to me, already fairly strong in there];W[lj]

(;B[mk]C[Doesn't gain you many points 
Tenuki for now and come back there later];W[qr];B[ij]C[Claude> Probably too deep...

Bad move in many ways
Again consider B15 and L2 and as for this area M9 gets you more territory]

Hope my review taught you a few extra tricks and feel free to contact me if you have questions, otherwise good luck.

Might be tempting to play something like C but that is gote and there is more important points. Although it would be good later]
