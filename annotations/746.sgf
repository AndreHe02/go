C[forfun (FF) - This is a fighting game.  It must have been fun to play.  Both W and B seem to like stretching their luck :-)  There are several situations that were too complicated to cover completely.  I don't know whether I have assessed them correctly.  All explanations and variations should be explored with an open mind - there are undoubtedly better ways to play not yet listed!

Black has two particular bad habits that most of us share:
1. Playing forcing moves whenever they are there.  At several points B hurts his game by destroying his own favorable aji through forcing moves.  This is a habit that needs to be worked on.  It requires that one take a calmer view of the whole board.  We should always ask ourselves, "If the opponent takes time out to play there and I get my choice of a move anywhere else, am I actually worse off?"  Most of the time the answer is no.

2. Playing extra moves to live.  This is a key weakness for amateurs to overcome.  B hands his opponent sente in the lower right and twice in the upper left.  This is like passing 3 times in the middle of the game.  This habit can be improved through practice with tsume go problems and such.  One way or another it requires the confidence to decide that a group is safe and then to act on that decision.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[fd];B[dg]C[FF - The knight's move in answer to the knight's move is non-standard.  W's original move is slow-paced and not too threatening.  Black will usually make a 2 or 3-space extension down the left side.  He can always attach at A to settle his stones, so the tenuki is another possibility.]
;W[jc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]
;W[kq];B[nc];W[ql]C[FF - This is an overplay with no other stones on the right side to support it.]
;B[qj]C[FF - This is a good aggressive approach];W[pk]
(;B[qg]C[FF - This is completely out of character with the preceding move.  It fully justifies W's overplay.  The only choice here is to push up (see the variation).]
;W[qr];B[on];W[mn];B[ol]C[FF - My own preference would be for something a little more vague here, such as O7.  The trouble with this move is that it leaves behind a weakness at Q7.  At the same time it forces W to push out against the B stones on the right.  B should want to attack the two W stones.  The best way to achieve this is to push to the left and attempt to surround W on a large scale.]
;W[pj];B[pi]C[FF - Following on the last comment, this move forces W to do what he wants to do anyway - jump out into the center, threatening B.  Simply drawing back at R11 may be better.  Notice that W may be able to play R9, threatening to capture the stone at R10.  If B answers, then W is ready to peep at Q7.]
;W[nj];B[oi]C[FF - This is questionable.  I think B is playing to make W answer and push B into playing in turn against the other W stones in the center.  However, W's bamboo joint is very strong and B is left with an insecure connection to the outside.]
;W[nk];B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[io]C[FF - A tremendous overplay that goes unpunished.  There are no weak W stones here.  This invasion is not connected to any of B's other stones.  In any case, B is aiming at the wrong target here.  The issue on the board is whether B can successfully attack W's 5 stones on the left.]

(;W[iq]C[FF - There is no reason to answer in such a passive way since W's stones are all strong here - see the variation.]

;B[eo];W[do];B[dn];W[em];B[dm]C[FF - This is aji-keshi.  B does W a big favor here.  B should play J7 immediately and leave this move unplayed.  Later he may be able to play out at F8, threatening to capture 2 stones in a ladder at G9.]
;W[el]C[FF - W is very strong in the center now.];B[ep];W[hr]
;B[er]C[FF - This is an extremely complex situation - or so it seems to me :-).  The issue is what happens of W connects at D3 instead of playing the ko directly.  I have added a bunch of variations but I do not know whether I have included the proper plays or not.  Definitely however, B should be regretting the play at D7!]

(;W[dr];B[dq];W[pm];B[eq]
(;W[om]C[FF - Considering that B has just lived in the middle of what was W's area originally, this does not look that big.  The question is what happens if W plays S7, trying to capture the whole group? I don't know the real answer because the situation is pretty complex.  However, I played with some variations as shown.]

;W[mq];B[nn]C[FF - This is aji-keshi.  Without this move R11 would be sente for B and help strengthen the right side.  B is already alive here.]
;W[nm];B[so]C[FF - This move was unnecessary and gives sente to W.]
;W[bd];B[cd]C[FF - Just playing B15 is better here.  After the C16, C17 exchange, capturing the one stone is small.  W wisely ignores it.]
;W[cc];B[be];W[cj];B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fk];W[fl];B[fi]
;W[eg]
(;B[ef]C[FF - Basically the losing move.  Black should play E12 (see the variation).  In the game, B forces W to run out into the center and creates two weak B groups while doing so!  W destroys B's left side and strengthens the top when B is forced to make eyes.]

C[FF - At least B should use this move to connect D9.  Any blocking move by W around here would be gote.  However, I think that W is securely ahead now.  B can not convert the upper right into all B territory.]

;W[lk];B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[ji];B[ij];W[gj]C[FF - W should play in the center and force B to live at G10 himself.  W's left side stones are too weak to prevent B from escaping.]
;B[li];W[mh];B[lh];W[mg];B[lg];W[jf]
(;B[lf]C[FF - When W connects at O11 with his next move, B does not appear to have an effective play against the W stones on the left.  That means that B needs to cut (see variation) instead of playing here.]
;W[ni];B[je];W[if];B[ie];W[he];B[fg];W[eh];B[ke];W[gf];B[dd]
C[FF - This is unnecessary.  It gives W sente to play on the right.

If B threatens to win with two moves in a row then W has to answer and the fight turns into essentially unlimited ko threats for B.  This is the kind of counting exercise that I hate to encounter in a game :-)]
