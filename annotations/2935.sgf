C[I made many mistakes in this game but of particular note
1.the need to kknow how to follow up a kakari
2.towards the end i felt that my RHS should have been MY territory, but i responded badly to his invasions
3. I also responded badly to the invasions on the lower side
4.I normally have a plan to look for good moves on the 3/4 rank before playing elsewhere..i got sucked in to a lot of centre play
5.i did not read the ladders, or rather i did but misjudged the fact that the end point was not safe
6.whilst i was down a lot on time, this was NOT an excuse but i did feel i was playing too quickly despite the fact i used much more time

=======================================

I've tried my best to provide the information you needed. In most cases, there are variations when I say a better sequence possible. If that's the case, please do see the variation.

Enjoy the review, I hope you find it helpful.

p.s. File best viewed with CGoban 2. If using another viewer, please turn off the "show next move" option. Enabling the "Show next move" option will interfere with the symbols I have placed.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[eq]C[a departure for me. Would normally play K3, or, if feeling adventurous, c10

=======================================

K3 and C10 are both of territorial and peaceful nature. But this kakari is also not bad, try experimenting with different openings, that's good.]
;W[dq];B[ep]TR[dq]C[Have only just started trying to use a kakari and did not know the follow up moves

=======================================

This is probably the best response to White's ttach at D3 (marked stone).]
;W[dn]
(;B[jq]TR[ep][eq]C[K4 instead perhaps? but was thinking of territory not influence

=======================================

This, or even K4, is good. The difference between K3 and K4 is that K3 aims to hold off invasion, while K4 aims to get influence through opponent invasion. In this case, I would prefer K4, since it is unlikely that the oponent can invade succesfully -without- suffering much.

For example, if the opponent does invade against K4, Black can get a lot of influence. (See variation).

With the marked stones in place, it's probably more favourable for Black to go for influence, but that is my opinion.

K3 here is also great, it depends on what you want. All said and done, it's back to what you said :)]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gq]
(;B[iq]TR[jq]C[This is not good...
Black should have extended towards H2, since the connection with the marked stone is already solid.

See variation to get an idea of how Black can retain his territory.]
;W[gr];B[en];W[dm];B[gn]C[just looking for some life for E4 grp

=======================================

Good idea. Trying to save it later might be too late.];W[fo]
;B[fp]TR[ep][eq]SQ[fo]C[Good move. Even though the marked (triangle) group can be considered to have bad shape, this is still a great move, as it captures the stone marked square.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[em]
(;B[eo]C[D5 instead perhaps.. i was not looking for a close fight but felt that i had to respond

=======================================

Yes, D5 would be better, and would probably leave you with the initiative. (See variation)

Another option would be F7. It would also help you run out.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[er]
(;B[ho]C[i think this was a bad move..achieves nothing. I wanted to play N3 or R10 but was worried about health of F4 grp

=======================================

True, this move is rather slow. However, F4 is not exactly alive yet, and this is not the ideal move. See variation 1 for a better and faster option for Black.

As for N3, that would be super slow. A White invasion there would hardly work. (See variation 2)]
;W[ip];B[lq];W[fq];B[ce]TR[dm][em][fm][dn]C[another attempt at a kakari, hoping to follow up with c12

=======================================

Good move, although you might consider D15 instead. There is not much difference, but with the influence White has around D7, I'd advise a higher move.]
;W[cg]
(;B[ee]C[a pincer :-(   Now what? considered f17 instead of e15

=======================================

Don't we all hate pincers..? 

Rather than running out, I'd go for C17. As for F17, that would be efficient if you want territory on the top side.]
;W[fd];B[eg];W[dh];B[bc]C[a bid for the corner

=======================================

Yes, good move. Black cannot be sealed in as of now, so Black should go for the corner.]
;W[df];B[de];W[ef]
(;B[bg]C[happy to sacrifice E13 in exchange for a base around b15

=======================================

I wouldn't be too happy with this exchange... The reason is that White gets too much outside influence.

Instead of this... I would rather move out at F15 first. (See variation)]
;W[bh];B[bf];W[fe];B[qj]LB[cb:A]C[felt that base was secured around b15 so looked to gain some territory on RHS

=======================================

Good idea. A (C18) would later become a big point.];W[jn]
(;B[hm]C[again worried about life of f5 grp so looking to build a second eye

=======================================

The concept of trying to make another eye is correct, but the move isn't. I would prefer something at around J7 or H8. (See variations)]
;W[gk]
(;B[jl]C[I would never recommend a knight's jump when running out. The reason is that it is cuttable, as White later showed.

Only use a knight's jump when the cut is well protected. 

I would prefer attaching to G9 or K6. (See variations)];W[ik]
;B[ll]TR[hm][en][fn][gn][eo][go][ho][ep][fp][eq]SQ[hl][im]C[Bad. The points marked square are cutting points, so you should defend either first. Black can still run out after defending not to get cut. The rule here is defend before running, as long as life is still ensured. To sacrifice the marked group would be too big.]
;W[il];B[im];W[jm];B[io];W[jo];B[in]C[securing the second eye but W could have played here previous move and that would have been trouble for me

=======================================

How true.];W[jp]C[Who is winning? Probably 1/4 thro game and i thought fairly even. A W moyo based on B4-B11 seemed threatening but could not see a way in

=======================================

The game at this point is very close. But White has better followups in midgame now, so I say White would have a better chance.]

(;B[kq]LB[cb:A][pb:B]C[This move was unnecesarry. I'd move at points like A or B. 

See variation to see what you can do if White cuts.];W[kl];B[jk]
;W[kk];B[jj];W[kj]SQ[jc][kc][lc][mc][gd][hd][id][nd][fe][me]
[df][ef][lf][cg][kg][bh][kh][ki][fl][gl][hl][il][dm][em][dn]
[do][cp][dq]C[the next passage of play is really bad by me ( B) i could see the ladder hitting e13 but did not take into account that was no use. If i had gone straight up K line then what do i achieve? Even now as i look again, i cannot see a plan for B. Unless i seek to build a moyo extending out from my firm ( which proved fragile!! ) base along RHS

=======================================

Well...I'd say Black should give up the 3 stones. Everywhere around that group is White influence. It would next to impossible to make that live. 

The square marks mark the area of White influence.

If B goes on extending...]
(;B[ij];W[hk];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki]C[j11 better?

=======================================

Well, in my opinion, the group is already dead, and cannot be saced, you can utilise this move to get outside influence though. (See variation in next move)]
;W[ii]
(;B[hj];W[hi];B[gj];W[fj];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[ei];B[fh]C[so i read the ladder,, just that ladder foundation was broken!

=======================================

;W[li]
(;B[kh]TR[jh][ki]SQ[gc][hc][ic][jc][kc][lc][mc][ld][le][lf]
[lg][lh]C[i should have kept with my plan and played say, O9 or P12

=======================================

Very true. Besides, the stones yyou just defended are dead... The square symbols mark the area of White influence, the reason why the marked stones are dead.

As for O9 and P12, they are bothh good choices.];W[lh];B[lg]
;W[mg];B[lf]C[i KNOW that building territory in the centre for beginners like me is very difficult...so why did i waste effort  :-((

=======================================

I don't mean to be rude, but this looks more like building dead groups in the center :)]
;W[mf];B[nj];W[lm];B[ml];W[mj];B[nk]C[this at least i thought was the semblence of a plan..space on the RHS

=======================================

Yes.];W[ni];B[oi];W[nh]
(;B[og]LB[oh:A][oj:B]C[For some reason, I don't really like this move. The reason is that if White pushes at P12 (A), the cut point at P10 (B) can be a little dangerous later on. I would prefer a move at P12 (A) instead, for Black. (See variation)]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[mm];B[nm]C[p12 better

=======================================

P12...?];W[nn]
(;B[no]C[Not good. Not only does this weaken the side and center, but also the bottom. You should have extended at P7. (See variation)]
;W[om];B[nl];W[mo]
(;B[on]C[Wrong direction. Atari at N4 is better. (See variation)]
;W[mn]C[i was worried about the cut at p5 and the aji (?) afforded by Wp7

=======================================

This position is certainly not good for Black. His shape is a bit too thin.]

(;B[oo]C[Bad move in this case. O4 was much better.];W[mp]
(;B[lp]C[perhaps i should have sac m5 and played n3

=======================================

That would have been much, much better. (See variation)];W[mq]
;B[mr];W[nr]
(;B[lr]C[now my ' secure base' will be lost.. if i had played correctly then my stones could have been saved and i would be 30 points better off]
;W[oq]
(;B[pr]C[looking to protect my corner

=======================================

The corner here is small compared to the life of the cut off group (M2 group). You should have played H2.]
;W[hr];B[ns];W[os];B[ms];W[or];B[ir];W[is];B[js];W[ks];B[hs]
;W[kr];B[np]C[pointless! q4 may have been better

=======================================

No doubt about that.];W[nq]
(;B[oc]C[looking to protect other corner..should i have finished attempting to secure r5 area first?

=======================================

The R5 area is not in much danger as of now, so this is good. A move at P18 (A) however, might've made more territory. (See variation)]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[nb];B[oe];W[nd];B[ne]C[q4 better.. this was a vain hope to rescue m14

=======================================

Well, this is a forcing move. So, you can play this first, then follow up with your next move.]
;W[me];B[ke]TR[lf][lg][jh][kh][ki]C[looking for eyes,, the next passage of play was dire by B.. skip to move 175

=======================================

This move was pointless, as you have realised. The chance of the marked group living is next to impossible.]

You probably mean B18 (A). It could have been played earlier, or you can just play that instead of your next move, D19 (B).]

;W[bb];B[ac];W[ae];B[sa]LB[nf:C][lk:B][do:A]C[Again, another slow move. Pushing at D5 (A) would be better. M9 (B) and O14(C) are also better choices.]
