C[Dear reviewer!

This game was played rather fast than slow;, has a clear result, but nevertheless, I would like to get some cammentaries.

The game was played on IGS today and both players have a  '+'  behind their grade and the weaker one has been the challenger and has taken white in order  to force a promotion in the one hand, ore a relegation on the other.

Now, have a look, enjoy and confirm your knowledge!

... and many thanks in advance:];B[qd];W[dd]C[I gave him the decision to choice a diagonal Fuseki ...]
;B[cp]C[... and hi has choosen the aggressiv one, as I wanted.]
;W[pp];B[eq];W[od]LB[cj:a]C[I took the ikken takakakari, no territory, but Influence.

Reviewer: 'a' is an ideal extension for both Black and White, so both should try to get it as soon as possible.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd]
(;B[or]LB[qe:a]C[Playing on the second line in the opening is not good. White can press this stone down and build influence. Furthermore, in this situation White can build more influence on the right side by playing at 'a', making a huge moyo on the right side.]
;W[nq];B[qq]
(;W[pq]LB[qe:a]C[This is a thank-you move. White should look for a way to end in sente so as to be able to play 'a'.]
;B[pr];W[qp];B[rq];W[rp];B[nr];W[mq]
(;B[qm]C[This stone is too close to the White thickness. White should attack it.]

(;W[dj]LB[qm:a]C[This is a big point, but I think attacking 'a' is more important, otherwise White's thickness in the bottom right corner will go to waste.]

(;B[cf];W[ce]C[I must not give him 4 corners!]
(;B[ci];W[df];B[bf];W[cj]C[This result is not good for Black. Again, like in the lower right corner, Black will live small, but White will build influence. Both groups will end up sealed in, so they won't contribute to the rest of the game, but White's influence works together.]
;B[di];W[ej];B[bj];W[bk]
(;B[aj]LB[ak:a]C[Not good. Now 'a' is Black's sente as well.]
;W[ei];B[bh]C[Being sealed in like this is painful for Black.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[pj]
(;B[qk]C[Again, approaching an enemy stone like this is not good. White will just block at 'a', and then what will Black do?]
;W[qj];B[eb]C[Another move on the second line. It seems Black wants to build lots of small groups, all disconnected from each other, while allowing White to build well-coordinated influence.]
;W[fc];B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[This could be another thank-you move, allowing Black to connect.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ae];W[cd];B[bc];W[db]C[White has ended in gote again, like in the lower right corner.]
;B[jc]
(;W[nb]TR[jc]C[Do you have another idea to answer the triangeld?

Reviewer: see variations.];B[hc];W[gb]LB[jc:a][qm:b]C[This feels like a small move. White should ask himself how to make profit by attack Black's weak groups 'a' and 'b'. Something like what was shown in the previous variation. The focus is on White's influence and moyo on the right side.]
;B[cm]C[Black leaves too many weak groups.]
(;W[kb];B[jb];W[hb];B[bl]C[Doubtful, move, because it  connects two strong groups. Better to help the weak groups.]
;W[qf]LB[pe:A][nf:1][pg:2][qg:3][qe:a]C[Invitation to play 'A', in order to get the points 1,2 or 3.

Reviewer: But 'a' is the vital point; see previous variations for a continuation.]

LB[jc:a][og:b]C[Playing this way is a bit dangerous for White; now White has to kill one or the other Black group, 'a' or 'b'. I think it would have been safer to seal in 'b'.]
