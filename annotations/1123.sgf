C[Hi,
thanks in advance for the review :) I was playing white, i would really appreciate all help you could give me in improving my game. Thanks

I believe there were some close fights, and i think i only won due to some mistakes from my opponent. Could you help me improve my play? Thanks

phi: I will do my best.];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]C[phi: good to take the corners first. Proverb: 1st corners 2nd edges 3rd center.]
;B[fq];W[hq]LB[cn:A][eq:B][dn:C][fp:D]C[Is this the correct answer to F4? what were the other options?

phi: your option is good. A bit agressive but playable. I Prefer A(C6) or C(D6). Other ways are D(F4) and B(E3). I sometimes play B(E3) when I already have a stone near K4.]
;B[fo];W[dn]C[phi: good: This sequence i a standard joseki (a win-win sequence).]
;B[fm];W[qk]LB[dl:A][kq:B]C[phi: I this situation I prefer something like A(D8). If your oponent (black) plays this, you will get surrounded in the corner!
Another way is to play B(L3) to save H3 and to reduce the force of the black wall.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[dj];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[en];W[dk]
LB[ck:A]C[phi: A(C9) is one point less territory, but you don't have cutting points [A(C9)\]]
;B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[bn];B[dn];W[bp]C[phi: good until now.]
;B[ci];W[dh]C[I think that after the fight black grew stronger... was there any other way?

phi: you have to do sometthing. I think it is a good move. You must not ignore the Black move (C11) otherwise black plays on C9!]
;B[di];W[ei];B[ch];W[dg]LB[eh:A]C[phi: In such cases I prefer A(E12). I don't like cutting points!]
;B[cg];W[cf]LB[df:A][fh:B][ej:C][eh:D][ck:E]C[phi: I don't think, that it is necessary to surround black. It is enough to confine him to the edge. I would have playd A(D14) or B(F12). With your play, you have many cutting points A(D14), D(E12), C(E10) and still E(C9)! See variation on E(C9).]

(;B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[cd];B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[ed];B[eh];W[dc]
LB[bd:A]C[phi: Too deffensive. If you want to get the corner, simply paly A(B16).]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh];B[eg];W[jd]TR[ei][fi][fh]
C[phi: This is a big point.];B[ld];W[ge];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[qf]
;B[qe];W[re]C[phi: This is what we call "sentai-gote". You have sentai  (meaning your oponent has to react). But if he reacts, you will have gote (meaning that you have to ract again. So your oponent gets sentai from your first sentai move.  In this case simply play A(S14). It is one point less in value, but you will keep sentai (the upper hand) which is worth 6 points.]
;B[rd];W[rg]C[phi: see: you have gote now.];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]
;W[lp];B[jq];W[jp]LB[jo:A][ip:B]C[Again i did the same response... altought most ppl tell me i shouldnt touch the piece i want to attack...

phi: this is true! If you touch that peace, it will get stronger. Only touch for defence. If you intend to attack that stone, play A(K5) or B(J4).   To touch == play adjacent to an opponents stone.]
;B[iq]C[phi: see: your opponents stone has now 4 liberties. Your stones have just 3 liberties. So your opponent gets strong.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[kq];B[hr];W[jr];B[gq];W[ir]C[phi: This is an endgame move. If you opponent ignores this, you make 2 points and your opponent gets 6 points (sentai) somewhere else!]
;B[hq];W[oi];B[qn];W[rm]LB[rp:A]C[phi: Your move is very near to your  opponents black stone at R6.
This forces black to respond. Again: Do not touch  a stone, you want to attack.  I would have played A(S4). This move attacks R6 and secures the corner at the same time.]
;B[rn]C[phi: See: Again black gets strong. That is not what you wantet. Your stone at S7 is very weak now.]
;W[rp];B[on];W[no]LB[np:A]C[phi: again: Don't force black to get strong. A(O4) makes a lot of territory and attacks P6 also.]
;B[oo];W[op];B[nn];W[mo];B[mn];W[lc];B[mc];W[lb]LB[kb:A][kc:B]
[md:C]C[phi: your move is playable. I prefer B(L17). Both moves (yours and B(L17)) produce blacks weak cutting point at N16. But after your move you still have weak points of your own  -  like A(L18).]
;B[mb];W[kd];B[le];W[if]LB[kb:A][jm:B][pm:C]TR[mn][on][nn][oo]
[qn][rn]C[phi: Now, or in the near future you have to protect against A(L17).
I think now it is time to attack the weak black stones at the right bottom (marked).
B(K7) attacks from far away. C(Q7) attacks while extending the right territory.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[jh];W[jk]TR[mn][on][nn][oo][rn][qn]LB[jf:A]C[I knew i couldnt let black get the whole center! was this a correct move?
phi: excellent! You move gives a great pressure on the black lower right group!
There is one weaknes, you just missed at A(K14). I normally play such moves immediately as a "natural flow of the game".
But anyway: your move is good.];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[lj]C[phi: good: you have to rescue your center stone.]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[kj];W[kl];B[jl];W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ik];W[ij]
;B[jk];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi]LB[ll:A][ck:B][jf:C]C[phi: I think now it is time to secure some cutting points like A(M8), B(C9) or C(K14).]

;B[kn];W[ll]TR[mm][mn][nn][on][oo][pm][qm][ql][rl][qn][rn]C[phi: good. To protect this ko is very important. This brings the black group under a very big pressure: Black has to find a second eye.]
;B[po]C[phi: here the second eye is. You have sentay.];W[qo]
LB[ma:A][bd:B]C[phi: this is not big. I prefer A(N19) as sentai. Or B(B16) as a big gote move.]
;B[om];W[io];B[in];W[ho];B[hn];W[hk];B[hl];W[fk];B[gk];W[ck]
LB[ie:A][kb:B][bd:C]C[I was afraid to get cut here... was there any other important move? I fell
i just leave to many weak spots in my defenses...
phi: this was of course an important spot. There are some more A(J15), B(L18) or C(B16).]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[br];W[bq];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[bd]C[phi: good. The corner is worth a lot of points.]
;B[bg];W[ma];B[nb];W[nf];B[ne];W[lf];B[me];W[ke];B[hf];W[ie]
;B[he];W[hd];B[fe];W[fd];B[na]C[What should i have done here?
It's not bad. If Black takes (1 point at M19), you simply extend your group to L18.]
;W[jc];B[la];W[ka]LB[kb:A]C[phi: Attention! You should defend this with A(L18). See variation, what black could have done! A(L18) is "Double atari": you will loose one group.]

(;B[ma];W[gf]LB[kb:A]C[phi: Still an important spot at A(L18). See variation...]

(;B[hg];W[hj];B[gj];W[sl]LB[kb:A][mi:B][sd:C][ar:D][go:E][fl:F]
C[phi: Your move is Sentai-gote: You have to answer the answer of your opponent!
There are still weak points: A(L18), B(Black Q12 white R13 followed by black N11 is dangerous: ATARI on your big group).
There are more valuable Sentai-Points: C(T16), D(A2), E(G5), F(F8),]
;B[sm];W[sk];B[sn];W[aj]C[phi: again "Sentai-Gote".];B[ai];W[ak]

(;B[mi]C[phi: Black played the wrong order: See variation:]
;W[ph];B[li];W[je];B[kb]C[And again...]
(;W[kc]LB[jb:A]C[phi: White could defend easily at A(K18). See variation.]
;B[ja];W[ib]LB[jb:A]C[phi: too deffensive of white. Play A(K18) -> KO.]
;B[ia];W[gb];B[ga];W[fa];B[ha];W[fb];B[gc];W[gd];B[hb];W[hc]
;B[jb]C[I was lucky my opponent did this mistake, otherwise i think black could have won...
phi: no way. White hat too big territories.];W[ka]C[phi: White wins by about 40 Points. This is normal that black resigns.]
