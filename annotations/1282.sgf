C[Hi,
I played black as 15k igs.  My real rank should be somewhere around that.
 I set about playing an offensive game against white who I don't think was
suspecting it.  He is 5k*.];AB[dj][pj][jd][jp][jj][pp][dd][dp]
[pd];W[qn]C[Say: Its set to free];B[qo];W[nc];B[oc];W[cn];B[dn]
LB[nd:a][pn:b]C[Thought I'd vary slightly, but white seems to respond weird

Its ok, but I would encourage you, to ignore such a move and punish w for his tennuki by playing at a (o16) or b (q6). the result would be a very strong position for b. A double attack onto the black d4 stone wouldnt be dangerous.]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[This seemed the right direction for the wall.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[bn];B[nd]C[Sente is nice here.  Did I respond correctly?

Very good!];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[nb];W[pc];B[mc];W[rc];B[rd]
;W[pa]LB[sc:a][sb:b][ra:c]C[This white group is dead. You could have killed it with the sequence a (t17), b (t18) c (s19).

White p19 instead of q19 would result in a ko.(same a-c-sequence)]
;B[sc];W[sb];B[sd]C[Good beginning, but this was wrong. s19 instead would  kill the w group.]
;W[ra]LB[pn:a]C[But anyway this is a very bad result for white, living on a small scale in gote at such an early stage of the game. Black a now (q6) and its hard to see how white will be able to turn the game.]
;B[pn]C[very good!];W[qq]C[Same mistake from white as in the upper right. The invasion is to early.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[rp]C[Very good! You are much stronger than a 15 k! White is dead now.]
;W[qs];B[rq];W[qj];B[qk]LB[qi:a]C[I would prefer the other side a (r11). your move seems overconcentrated to near to your bottom thickness.]
;W[qi];B[pi]LB[pk:a]C[Looking back, S-9 makes better use of my wall, opinion?
Yes, s 9 seemt better to mee, too. Or evan a (q9). White may live again on a small scale, but black will get a tremendous moyo.]
;W[rk];B[rl]LB[qh:a]C[a (r12) looks better here.];W[ql];B[pk]
;W[rm];B[rj];W[sl];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[sn]LB[pm:a]C[very bad from w. he has to get out into the center. Now a (q7) is sente for b.]
;B[qg]LB[pm:a]C[better first a.];W[fc];B[ec];W[fe];B[df];W[ch]
LB[eg:a]C[Ah, here my lower rank begins to show through.

No cause for fear. Just a (e13) is enough an w is the one who has problems.]
;B[hc];W[gb];B[gc]C[good!];W[fd];B[ci]LB[eb:a]C[first a (e18)]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[ei];B[fg];W[gf];B[hg]LB[gg:a][hh:b]C[not so good. there is no need for creating cutting points in your shape. a or b is better]
;W[eb];B[db];W[gg];B[gh];W[ie];B[je];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[kf]
;W[ke];B[le];W[kg];B[lf];W[ig];B[jh];W[ih];B[ji]C[Ok, I didn't contain white, so I built my wall

its ok, you are still clearly on the winning route. white has just 4 points in the upper right, 2 points in the lower right, less then 10 points in the lower left. black is far far far far ahead.]
;W[hh];B[fi];W[ej];B[bg];W[hb];B[ib]LB[bh:a][el:b]C[locally j17 is better. but this region seems small to me.  better a (b12) or something around b.]
;W[ic]C[too small for w];B[id];W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ia]
;B[hd]C[this are just 2 unimportant stones, not worth one move at this stage of the game. Its a big endgame move, not more.]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[big mistake! just connect, and propably w dies. If he could manage to live, then he will get another 4 points in gote. afterwards you can attack the 4 white stones.]
;W[dc];B[ed]LB[cb:a];W[cb];B[bc]LB[bh:a][cf:b]C[better secure a (b12) if white plays a, he has the annoying move b (c14).]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[bh];B[be];W[dl];B[fm];W[ho]C[now the game begins to turn. white has some points ans now he tries to reduce your moyos.]
;B[in]C[ok];W[fr];B[er]C[good! this are no 15-kyu moves.];W[cr]
;B[fq];W[gr];B[gq];W[hq];B[ip];W[hp];B[hn];W[fp]LB[dm:a][ir:b]
C[now black a (d7) and b (j2) and white is dead.];B[fo]C[not necessary]
;W[gp];B[ep]LB[eq:a];W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[kq];W[hs]LB[fs:a]C[white is dead. a (f1) will kill him.]
;B[iq]LB[fs:a]C[now white a, and he only must give up 2 stones.]
;W[ir]LB[fs:a]C[again white is dead, with a (f1) you could kill]
;B[eq]C[very bad. f1 is sente for w and so he will get 2 eyes.]
;W[fs];B[io]LB[pm:a]C[first a (q7) which is sente.];W[es]LB[pm:a]
C[ver bad. white lives anyway. with a (q7) he can rob you some points in the center.]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[fk]LB[bb:a][pm:b]C[much to small. there is nor territory for b in this region. dont forget the sente a (b18) and of course b (q7)]
;W[pm]C[as you notice, my ability at containing lacks somewhat.

:)];B[on]LB[om:a]C[better a (p7)];W[om];B[nm];W[ol];B[nl];W[ok]
;B[nj]C[good.];W[nk];B[mk];W[oj];B[ni];W[oi];B[oh];W[hj];B[ij]
C[Suggestions?

no];W[gi]LB[hk:a]C[now a suggestion: what about giving uo this one stone and playing a (h9)?]
;B[fh]C[it was just a suggestion :)];W[hk];B[bb];W[ca];B[ba]
;W[da];B[dm];W[cm];B[el];W[dk];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag];W[bi];B[ro]
;W[rn];B[sj]LB[ik:a]C[this is too small because its no sente. better a (j9)]
;W[sk]C[not necessary];B[ik]C[here my comment ends. Black made a few slack moves but more very good moves for a 15 k and at the end gains an impressive win.
Hope I could help you to improve a little. C U];W[gl];B[gm]

;W[mj];B[ll];W[lm];C[Ok,
I won by alot, but if white did the standard openings I would definately
have faired less.  More a lack of handicap experience on his part than skill
on mine.

Thanks for the review.])
