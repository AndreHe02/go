C[Hi, my name is Michel Schaake (8k). my comments start with M:]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ec];W[dc]LB[de:a][df:b][hd:c][gc:d]
[gd:e][ic:f]C[is this proper joseki

M: although it's never mentioned as joseki it is playable. most common joseki moves are at: a(D15), b(D14), c(H16), d(G17), e(G16), f(J17)]
;B[ed]C[is this the right way to respond?

M: yes, although in the game the sequence wasn't finished. (see later comments)]

(;W[iq]LB[df:a][cf:b][ph:c]C[M: here white should've played at a (D14) or b (C14)

see variation]
(;B[cj]LB[df:a]C[M: this is an excellent chance for white for fixing his mistake of playing tenuki with 8. Black should have played at a(D14).

see variation];W[ch];B[cm];W[qf];B[nc];W[jc]
(;B[hc]LB[id:a]C[M: Better at a (J16), especially in combination with your low position in the upper right corner. (see variation)]
;W[lc];B[ie];W[mc];B[nb]LB[qc:a]C[M: You should consider using this move to get to the center with these corner-stones, you could do thid while pressuring white. Note that you didn't secure the corner with O18. white can still invade at a(R17), or easily escape as he did in the game.]
;W[le];B[po];W[fp];B[cq]LB[ei:a][cf:b]C[M: When playing this move you should be aware of the fact that white can build a wall facing upwards while allowing you to live small in the corner. The problem with that is that it puts white in an excellent position to attack your C7 and C10 stones. Perhaps you should first play a(E11), threatening  b(C14), thus giving your two stones some more possibilities if white builds that wall]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bo];B[eq];W[fq]
(;B[fr];W[gr]
(;B[fs]C[M: wrong move (see variations)]
(;W[gs]C[M: W34 is not needed];B[dr]C[could white have played differently to kill black?

M: Black should be able to live with the C3 invasion. Look through the included variations to see some of the possibilities and problems. In my opinion this a good result for white, especially since he now has sente]
;W[lp]LB[of:a][qc:b]C[M: I do think white missed an opportunity here to confine black to the upper right corner in sente at a(P14), threatening b(R17)]

(;B[qi]LB[of:a]C[M: The idea of this approach is a little bit dangerous, as you are inviting white to attack the upper right corner

You might consider keeping the white stones on the upper side and right side seperated by playing a(P14). This will leave white with two weak groups]
;W[qh];B[rh]LB[pi:a]C[M: white can easily escape, so it's pointless to try to destroy his eye-space. I'd rather see a(Q11), working better towards building territory on the lower right side.]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[qd]LB[of:a]C[M: White is nice to you here, as he could have secured sente by playing a(P14)]
;B[qc];W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[sd];W[se];B[rb];W[pe];B[od];W[of]
;B[oi];W[qn];B[ql];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn];B[mq]C[M: With this move you've made White 36 (M4) into a good move (shoulderhit). Your move doesn't secure the corner and doesn't escape]
;W[lq];B[rp];W[oo];B[qo];W[rn];B[rm];W[om];B[dd];W[db];B[cf]
;W[cg];B[df];W[mb];B[ej]LB[di:a]C[M: Why not a little more aggressive at a (D11), instead of giving white something to peep at?]
;W[fa];B[gb];W[je];B[if];W[ph];B[pi];W[ok];B[pk];W[nh];B[nk]

;W[bi];B[ci];W[aj];B[al];W[ei];B[fi];W[dg];B[fh]C[M: good moves. White shouldn't be able to make life on the right side, so you're right in making thickness]
;W[be];B[bf];W[bg];B[af];W[ef];B[ee]C[serious mistake
e13 is better, right?

M: yes, so far white didn't have a change to let his group live, and in my opinion shouldn't even have tried. He only succeeded in making you strong on the outside.

But white is still dead (for now), see later comments];W[eh]

(;B[bj]C[M: this is a more serious mistake, you've just given white his second eye. see variation]
;W[ag];B[fg];W[eg];B[eb];W[ea];B[ce]C[M: nice ko-threat, but where is the ko?]

(;B[il]LB[hd:a]C[M: here you should have connected the ko at a(H16) White G8 is no threat (see variation)]
;W[hd];B[jm]C[M: this threat isn't big enough either];W[jn]
;B[gd];W[fm];B[hl];W[hd];B[in];W[io];B[gd];W[em];B[dn];W[hd]
;B[kn]C[was this a bad move?

M: yes, most of the ko-threats weren't big enough and this is one of them.]
;W[gd]C[M: both players had loads of opportunities to connect this ko]

;B[jg];W[jd];B[lf];W[ke];B[mf];W[me]C[what would the final score have been like?

M: this is very difficult to tell, but i will give one estimation.....

Some observations:
- when playing a move, consider what effects your opponents responses will have on nearby groups
- don't approach your opponent too strongly, that will only help him get strong
- when ahead, play secure, even if it means letting your opponent live (i.e. if you're not sure how to kill him)]

[lh][oj][ck][oc]AW[nd][oe][nf][ng][oh][sg][so][ro][no][lo][ln]
[ml][jp][kp][is][aq][am][ol]C[M:... This is what you would approxamately get:

Black: 81+20=102

White: 68+27=95

Black leads by 7 points

So it was very close at the end, and it could have gone both ways in the endgame.]

(;B[hd];W[hl];B[fm];W[il];B[fk]))
(;W[gd]C[M: White connects the ko, and there's far too little room for black to make two eyes.

Note that when black captures E19 and F19, white will simply throw in at E19]
