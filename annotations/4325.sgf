C[Hi, Thank-You for reviewing my game.  I been out of go for a while.  Just starting to get back into it.  I think I was doing okay in this game until at the end when I lost focus and just started finish :(.  I made comments in the game as to what I was thinking.  Please let me know where I need to fix my game, my openning is my biggest weakness :(.

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt.  I'm 2dan at the local club which means I'm too weak to tell you what the correct moves are, but maybe I can give you ideas what to think about.
Please use an sgf reader that displays variations properly - cgoban1, qgo, jago, gGo, glGo all work, but cgoban2 (the KGS client) has some problems.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[nc];W[nq]LB[qj:A]C[ISK: I Considered R10, but with wide corner enclosure I figured this would be enough.

crux: Splitting the right side seems like the most important thing to do.  So, this approach is probably the wrong direction.  In this position, A occurs in 97% of professional games in my database.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[qp]C[ISK: Wrong side?

crux: Quite.];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]
(;W[qj]LB[qi:A]C[ISK: Since Black blocked on the wrong side R4, I decided to invade, I didn't want to go above or below R10, b/c that would give black too much to play with.

crux: I think I'd prefer White A - probably an extension from the shimari is more valuable to Black than an extension from the wall (if White extends up, it feels like it'll have a larger effect on the corner than extending down will have on the wall).]
;B[qh];W[qm];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]TR[dd]LB[cf:1][fc:4]
[ic:A][jq:2][lc:3][oj:5]C[ISK: First place in the game, that I was lost.  I considered the following moves.

1: Stop black from approching, but it didn't seem good move b/c I don't have any future development.  I play 1, black plays 4.  To me 1 and 4 are miai.

2: This seemed like the most important move as it stops black from getting base for his stones.

3: I thought this would be a good attack, but I couldn't see how I would follow it up.

4: Again same reason as #1, 4 - 1 miai, so I was going to let black approch first.

5: I didn't think I was in imidiate danger so thats why I didn't think that was important.


crux: White at 2 looks uninteresting to me - there isn't much potential on the lower side, and the black wall isn't in any immediate danger.  I think the top right corner has the biggest potential for growth in this game.  If Black can extend on the top side, he'll limit the potential of the triangled hoshi stone.

White at 3 has the drawback of coming close to a pretty strong stone which in general you'd want to avoid.  White A, leaving room for a two-space extension, might be safer, and looks like a reasonable extension from the marked stone.

Playing 5 now strengthens this group and prevents many sente moves against it later, which also limits Black's potential in the top right somewhat.

I'd probably go for A, but 5 is a serious contender.];W[jq]
;B[cf]C[crux: Wrong direction again, I think.];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[oh]C[ISK: I expected black to play D12, seemed normal to me.  But after black played P12, I didn't know where to answer.  I thought about P10, but played P7 to threaten O4 cut.]
;W[om];B[pn]C[ISK: To obvious huh?

crux: Well, this move just helps White fix a weakness - a peep on the other side is the usually more troublesome.]
;W[ok]C[crux: Looks like some kind of shape, but maybe simply connecting would do the job better.]
;B[lp]
(;W[ch]LB[lc:A]C[ISK: Since blacks stones were too far I thought it would be a good attack.

crux: It's only an attack if your stones are stronger than the ones you're trying to attack.  That isn't the case here since you're outnumbered 5 to 1 and it's Black's turn.  Likely you'll end up with the weaker group.
Instead, I'd try something in the top right corner now, or possibly just extend to A (now that you're strong in the opposite corner)]
;B[ef];W[eh];B[bc];W[bb];B[cd];W[db];B[de];W[ed];B[pm]C[crux: This doesn't seem to help Black.]
;W[pl];B[rm];W[qn];B[qo]
(;W[on]C[ISK: Bad move?  Should I have done S6 instead?

crux: S6 has a bigger effect on your eyeshape, but Black has S5 as a reply which threatens the corner.]
;B[rn];W[ql]C[ISK: Def bad.  I don't know why I didn't just catch.]
;B[np];W[rq];B[gf];W[gh];B[hd]C[ISK: I think I should have ansetred this at H18 to make it easier for my group above.  ANd to rob black of any potentional at top.  But i didn't, I don't know why.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[ek]C[ISK: Bad move I think .. white is too open.  After playing that I thought about how I would answer D11, and I could't decide on any good answer :(.

crux: Just connecting seems to work fine.]
(;B[el];W[fl];B[em];W[fm]LB[dk:A]C[ISK: Greedy?  I should have defended at F9?

crux: D9 (A) looks like a shape point.];B[fn];W[dk];B[cl];W[lc]
LB[qc:B][qf:A]C[ISK: I finally get to play this, but I think it was a bit inmature ... I should have played H18 first.

crux: This move might not be such a good idea now - Black seems to be stronger in all the surrounding areas, and you might end up with a third barely alive group that doesn't actually make you any points.  When entering an area where your opponent is strong, try to find a move that allows you to get settled quickly.

It's hard to come up with good moves in this position.  Maybe something could be done against the corner at A or B.]
;B[jc];W[le];B[ne];W[lg]C[ISK: Now I have two weak groups I was at a lose :(.]
;B[ig];W[mi];B[mr]C[crux: Not sente I believe.]
(;W[oq];B[hq]LB[bq:A]C[crux: This could be an invitation to just play A.]
;W[fo];B[gn]C[crux: White invited Black to weaken the left center group.]

;W[jh]C[ISK: I felt I was behind now.];B[gc];W[qf]C[ISK: My crazy attempt to reduce his corner, I think I got lucky.

crux: With his positions on the outside of the corner, there might be enough aji for White to exploit, so I don't think it's an crazy attempt.  In fact, I'd probably have tried something like this earlier in the game.  Here, you probably got slightly more than you deserved, though.]

;B[be];W[ak]C[ISG: That sequence to do this monkey jump good idea? bad?  I think bad now that I see I end up with gote.

crux: That, and you made a gift of one stone to Black, which is unnecessary.]
;B[bk];W[aj];B[al];W[hg]C[IGS: Bad move?  b/c at the end i ended up with Gote.  and black got to play a good move in center.  Maybe I should have played K8 first?

crux: That does look bigger.];B[hf];W[je];B[ie];W[ih]TR[hg]
C[crux: This move looks unnecessary; you can afford to give up the marked stone.]

;B[eb];W[ec]C[IGS: Again I didn't even try to read the cut at F14 .. just answered :(.  But looking at it now I don't think it would have made a difference.  Bad call :(.  I think I was about 5 points ahead if I played normal.  But I am not sure.]
