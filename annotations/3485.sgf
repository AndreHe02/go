C[I'll make a few comments about what I think is going in the game, but feel free to contradict them or point out more important things.  Thanks in advance for your help!

D:  Game reviewed by DimitriLW (4k* on IGS).  Comments will be marked with "D:".  I must stress that my comments are just random ramblings of a player who wishes that he was stronger than he is, and should be taken as "food for thought" and not as "things worth memorizing".  

B will note that the two key mistakes are:
(1) tactical errors -- move #41 and moves immediately after are the key ones.
(2) strategic errors -- B sometimes appears uncertain of what stone to play, and what direction to take the game.

Thank you for sharing your game with me.];B[pd]C[I am black.]

D: I am not strong enough to say what joseki pattern is the best option, however I can say that this pattern is found in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary.]

;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qi]C[D: I like this stone, but then I'm only 4k.  Perhaps my like of this agressive play is a reason for my own weakness?  Anyway, in this game this stone really works for W.]

(;B[qb]LB[qh:A]C[This may be too passive for me, because white didn't play at A, but one space further.

*****
D: This is far too passive.  Now W has a huge framework coming together, and sente.  That's too big a gift.  This stone sets a downhill pace for B's game.]
;W[cj]C[D: I think I prefer W just shoring up the bottom-right corner and claiming a secure lead.  ...but this stone works.]

;B[lo];W[jq]C[D: B needs to be cautious, as cutting points are becoming abundant.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[hp]LB[mo:A]C[I question this move.  It might be better to reinforce at A.

*****
D: ...or at N4.  This move needs to be at either N4 or 5 (I prefer N4).]
;W[mp];B[np];W[mo];B[mn]C[D: This can't work for B.  Now B is giving points to W, and that is the final straw that leads to the resignation.]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[nn];B[qq]LB[mm:A]C[An overplay on my part.   Obviously black has to play at A.to prevent a ponnuki.]

(;B[ch]LB[lm:A][cl:B]C[Is it bigger just to capture at A?  Or perhaps the atari at B is bigger?  Or maybe none of this matters compared to the status of the black group in the lower right corner.  I'm clueless!

*****
D: When you have sente, and feel clueless on how to best use it, that is a good time to stop and assess how the game is going prior to your move.  After W's stone #58, I estimate W ahead by 10 or 15 points (but I have to confess that I'm horrible at score estimates).  Now, let's assess how the different moves you suggest might affect the score... (see alternate move trees).

The results of other options:
Capture at A = W+5+sente
Atari at B = W+5+sente
LR Corner = W+10+sente

And if we estimate the game play, the score appears to be about even, with sente in W's corner.

So I'm going to go out on a limb (and likely be corrected by a higher-rank player) and say that B's play is okay, however B needs to remember that W holds sente, and W's potential territory is looking better than B's, so B will need to ensure that W doesn't continue to develop a sizable framework for territory.]
;W[ej];B[eh];W[dg]C[D: ?  This peep looks odd.];B[dh];W[fe]
;B[ef]C[D: Good.];W[gj];B[qs]C[D: R4 is easier.];W[qr];B[qp]
C[I think this group lives now, but it is small.

*****
D: True.  Was it worth it?  I'm not certain.];W[fg]C[D: W needs to remember how damaging a B stone at R5 or Q5 would be.]
;B[eg];W[fh];B[ff];W[km];B[gf]LB[ml:A]C[A bit slow compared to A.

*****
D: Even more important than A is just noticing how your lower-center stones are noticably weaker.  They need a secure connection to the lower-left-corner stones, else they risk capture.]
;W[hh]C[D: I'm not certain that this is the best stone for W, locally speaking.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[dl]LB[cl:A]C[Terrible.  Certainly black has to play the atari at A instead of peeping.

*****
D: Yep.];W[dj];B[cl];W[og];B[ob];W[nb];B[pc];W[hn];B[hq];W[hr]
;B[ml]C[D: I don't think B sees how the lower center group is tenuously close to being cut off.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[ho]C[D: Ouch.  Score estimate: W+30];B[gr]LB[gm:A]
SQ[lo][hq][ko][kp][hp][ip][jp]C[This cut doesn't get anything.  Maybe I black should just play something like A.   But the fight is hard for me to judge.  I think black's marked stones are basically captured now, so one question is how to use them?

*****
D: I don't know the answer.  I think this game may be beyond recovery now.

I think that the key to the game was two things:

First, and most obviously, are the tactical errors that B makes which lead to the capture of the entire bottom area.  The whole early exchange in the lower right really hurt B in the long-run after move #41.  B needed to play more cautious and reinforce his stones.  Live-and-death problems are excellent for improving tactical decision making.

Second, and more important for the long-term, is developing a skill to see big-picture.  B is clearly working on this skill, as demonstrated by their own acknowledgement of being clueless at certain points in where to place a stone, and then taking the initiative to consider a few options.  However, B will want to continue to develop this skill.  Honestly, the reviewer is in desperate need of improving this skill also, so I hesitate to recommend methods of improvement.  Perhaps learning to count territory would be good for both B and the reviewer?  Also, knowing some go proverbs can help guide the way you approach a go board. My favorite go proverb is "Don't follow proverbs blindly."  :)

Again, thank you for sharing your game with me.  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.  I will try to answer them, or if I do not know the answer, then I will direct you to a superior go-player who can offer an answer.

End of comments.];W[fr];B[ir];W[gs]LB[ge:A]C[My last moves would seem to be wasting ko threats since they don't work.  Perhaps black should just play at A.]
;B[cr];W[br];B[jr];W[kr];B[dr];W[er]SQ[ml][mm][mn]C[I resigned at this point.  Black has lost a lot of the bottom, and the marked group is weak.  I do not see a way for black back into the game.]

(;B[lm]C[D: Score estimate: even to W+5 (plus sente, of course).]

(;B[cl]C[D: Score estimate: W+5 (plus sente, of course).  Also, note that sente here could be dangerous... W N8, B M7, W M8, B L7... W just got quite a bit of strength for free.]
)
(;B[qp]C[D: Score estimate W+10 (plus sente, of course).  This play isn't really valuable because B could still either live in the corner, or do damage along the right.  The four stones in the corner were not a waste, unless B only sees them as a live-dead group, and not as aji to use in order to make life on the right.]

(;B[lc]C[Maybe black can invade now.

*****
D: Perhaps.  However I do not think this is the right time to consider such a stone.]
))
(;W[go];B[gn];W[gp]SQ[pp]C[This variation might work better with white's marked stone (Q4).

*****
D: This sequence is not a standard joseki pattern, and I think the reason is that there is far too much space between the G-stones and the marked stone.  Also, W's C4 stone looks weak now.  Playing light (as in the real game) is often the better option, especially this early in the game.]
