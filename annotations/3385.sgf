AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][dp][jp][pp]TR[dj]C[Hello!

this is ozelot ^^
my opinions may differ from stronger players opinions.
sometimes i can get harsh.
dont take it personal :)
this game was played with unreasonable handicap.
you need more than 7 stones against a 16k opponent.
you are 28k at best in this game.
still i was able to put in some advise and comment on some sequences.
look at variations where i did include them.
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO REVIEW YOU NEXT GAME,
TO CHECK YOUR IMPROVEMENT!


lets start.


ok, placement of handicap stones.
you should have placed the marked stone into the center, in respect to both lines of symmetry.
Having a ston on the tengen(center point of the board) prevents ladders towards the center in all four corners.
This is an important point.
So this is actually your first mistake.

;W[pj]C[ok. white invades with *1*.
attacking from either side would gain little as white can just slide to the other an gain a living position instantly.
so its correct not to attack white1 directly.];B[nc]LB[qn:B]
[ph:A]C[ok. you play black2 here.
a keima aiming to exert the power of the two marked stones towards white1 on a point like A.
but still there is the same problem as before:
white can just simply slide to lets say B.
but actually what happens if white counters your plan an takes the primary direction of your 2stoneformation away by playing there on his own?]
;W[qf]C[in this position whites group is settled for the moment.
but there is NO secure white territory on the board yet.
black also has no secure territory, but black has an huge advantage regarding influence/power.
so your whole game strategy should be:
gain territory while attacking.]
(;B[rd]LB[qm:A]C[this is certainly no attack.
and as we see next white ignores it accordingly.
better extend towards white formation from the other side at A and concede the corner to white.
you can the continue to attack the isolated stone.
see variations!];W[fp];B[eq];W[fn]LB[dn:A]C[its always good to keep your stones connected!
so why dont you simply play A?];B[fj]C[this move does not accomplish anything.
accordingly it gets ignored.];W[dg];B[cf];W[fc];B[ff];W[cc]
;B[dc];W[de];B[df];W[db];B[cd];W[bc]LB[eg:A]C[what about A?]

read ahead!

there is no excuse in GO for not counting or not reading even ONE MOVE AHEAD.]
;W[qb];B[pa];W[md];B[ld];W[mc];B[mb];W[lb]C[zenbones:  Here I realized that any assault into the upper right corner would fail, miserably, at this point, I will be back to this later, when I have established better footing in my opinion.

sorry to be so harsh but if you completley lack the technical understanding, how are you supposed to devise a startegy?
read beginners books and go to www.goproblems.com until you have some understanding.]

Too many times in the past, I've lost corners due to large over extentions and then the oponent playing at the 3-3 point.  I did not see any major threats at this point, so I played here to prevent a further invasion into space I controlled.]

C[zenbones: I was attempting to solidify up here, to  gain back some teritory lost early in the game.  I failed, but I was wondering if you could give a better approach both at the begining and the end to this.]

try to play some small board games to improve your fighting.
9x9 or 7x7 work best.
next play some 13x13 or 15x15 if it works better go back to 19x19, but for now you simply do not have an understanding of the game as a whole.
read someth. like <<go a complete introduction to the game>> by cho chikun.
do tsumego!!
check out sesnseis library on the net.
download an play with igowin until you can reach 10k easily.
before that you lack the technical knowledge.
keep playing! think before you put down a stone!
a move that can easily be ignored is not a move at all!

if you have any more specific questions dont hesitate to email me.

;W[rd]LB[of:F][pq:E][cp:D][dc:C][rk:B][qc:A]C[white would probably simply dive into the corner with white5.
what next.
remember, that we wanted to offer the corner for outside, so DONT react at A.
its time for some serious analysis.
one could think about another slide to B.
but the corner in the lower right is still open for invasion and you might make a mistake while fighting.
and besides B is not a lethal threat at all.

our plan was to make territory while attacking. not to keep attacking just for fun.

lets do smth. that soothes our mind.
so what about closing a corner on C, D,or E taking safe profit?
well, not bad, but this is to defensive. one must not let slip the initiative so easily.

what comes to our mind might be a capping play at F.];B[of]
