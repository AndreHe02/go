C[Game review prepared 24/4/2001 by
Neil Mitchison (Niall 5k*) at the
request of Adrian Nedan, who played  black. Adrian's comment and questions  are unprefixed; Neil's comments are
prefixed by "NM".];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[op]C[NM: early! It's certainly playable,
but if B chooses a joseki where he
ends with sente, he can play in the
empty corner.];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[dd]C[is R6 better?

NM: "better" is always difficult, but
I would play R6. If W answers, say K4,
your BR corner is totally safe and  you can then play in the TL; if not, you
can get a good attack by playing K4
yourself. And if you don't play R6,
W can - now or later - play R5.];W[ci];B[cf];W[cl];B[cn]C[NM: Good!]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[er]C[Seems K3 or K4 is better

NM: Difficult to judge; I think I prefer
what you played. This prevents the  invasion at C3, which is annoying
otherwise; and it's nearly sente.];W[fr];B[jp]C[NM: It's a good move, but I think it's a
bit early. I would prefer to reinforce  the corner group first, with R6 or Q5]
;W[jn]
(;B[ko]C[I'm not sure how i should have played here. I also  considered M3.

NM: the usual response of a keima
(H5 or M5) doesn't work well here
because the W stones are strong on each
side. The tsuke at L6 is I think
possible (see variation). But this way, although a bit heavy, is perfectly
possible; I don't think White can
hem you in. And if he doesn't, you'll  have broken him into two groups, and
you have quite good possibilities of
making eyes on the lower side.];W[kn];B[lo]C[NM: I prefer N5.]
;W[ln];B[mo]C[M3?

NM: No, you have to try to get out.]
(;W[on]C[NM:White O6 doesn't work - see  variation.]
(;B[nn]C[NM: Black N6 doesn't work - see
variation.];W[om]
(;B[oo]C[I thought i could capture the three white stones

NM: Yes, this should have been O7 -
see variation.];W[no];B[po];W[mn];B[nm];W[ol];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm]
;W[mk];B[kl]C[big mistake

NM: Yes, the only play here is M8,  terrible shape and all!
(L7 fails against L8)];W[ll];B[lm];W[km];B[mr];W[nr];B[mq]C[I wasn't sure i could save my group. Seems  that white can kill it.

NM: I think so - I can't see
how you could deal with an attack at L3.]
(;W[jo]C[Looks like N4 is better for white.

NM: I think that lets you live,
though small - see variation.];B[mp];W[ip];B[jq]C[I think my group is alive now.

NM: I think so. But W is clearly ahead.];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir]C[NM: W should play elsewhere, e.g. F17]
;B[qm]C[Looks small but i wanted to be sure i don't lose  the corner

NM: It's quite big - a good move.];W[qk];B[qf]C[Maybe O17 would be better but white can take a  lot of teritorry here if i don't stop him.

NM: You're behind, so maybe you
need some slightly unreasonable
plays. And it's true that if W attacks
with R12 you can play R17.];W[fc];B[qi]C[NM: Good!];W[of];B[qc]
C[S16 looks safer

NM: Yes, it would have been much
better. This way you can be split into
two weak groups.];W[qd]C[NM: Essential!];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb]
C[NM: Bad! This allows you to link the  two groups. White should have played
O17 and continued to press you down.];B[od]C[O17 is joseki but i felt i could get something by  playing P16

NM: This is joseki too, but has to be
followed up with S16.];W[nc];B[ne]C[Probably a mistake, S16 seems to save the  corner.

NM: More important, it links your two
groups.];W[rc];B[oh]C[overplay?

NM: I don't think so - you must save
tthe R14 group, and this may enable you
to do so.];W[nf];B[hc]C[Perhaps i should secure my left group first.

NM: Yes];W[db];B[cc];W[cb]C[NM: W should play F15 here, and try and
capture the H17 stone on a large scale.
He is not using his massive thickness
at the bottom right.];B[kc];W[me];B[fe]C[NM: The idea is good, but I would jump straight out at H15 first.]
;W[gb];B[gd]C[NM: Lets him live. I would play H18 to
keep White off balance, even if it lets
him come out at G16 (you can answer  with J14).];W[hb];B[ei]
C[Is this the right way to play in this position?

NM: It's quite good. It reinforces your
corner/top group, which is still thin,
while pushing around the White C11 group.

Another possibility would have been E7.

But I think it's still more urgent to
settle your R14 group, by playing  something like S15 or P10.]
;W[dj];B[di]C[NM: A bit pointless, and inviting
C12, which is big. What about H11?];W[ch];B[dg];W[ej];B[gi]

;W[nh]C[Q13 looks like a better move for white

NM: Yes];B[oi];W[ni];B[pg];W[pf];B[qe];W[rd];B[re]C[bad shape?

NM: Yes, terrible ... but they
probably live now! Though I'm not
sure what happens if White plays S13.];W[qb];B[ec];W[eb];B[dc]

I would appreciate if you could tell me what my  weaknesses and strengths are.
Thanks in advance!

NM: I can't assess your weaknesses and
strengths very well on the basis of
one game, but I would say that you
weren't thinking enough about the
weaknesses of your own groups. OK, you
made a mistake with O6; but R17
was very bad strategically. On the
other hand, you attacked the weak  White groups quite well.]
