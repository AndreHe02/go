C[[yip\] Just an observation before starting - from the game info, this looks like a game between a 4d and 14k with no komi.  Assuming that is accurate, I believe that part of the motivations behind white's moves was an attempt to win by as little as possible (a half point).


[TOTAL\] Basically, I think I shouldn' t have allowed the opponent to draw a line from g5 to g8]

[yip\]
Or if you wanted to be even safer as far as keeping your stones connected, F8.  White would end up with about 5-7 points in the corner, while you would get a couple more in the lower right, as well as a strong center wall.]
;W[gd];B[fb];W[ih]C[what is the strategic importance of this move?

it later appears to threaten survival of the black group in the corner, however could the opponent have predicted this at such an early stage?!


[yip\]
At first, I thought the opponent may have accidentally clicked on the board while reading out a sequence.  Then I noticed white's rating, and I'm not so sure if it was unintentional.

As far as predicting it at an early stage, it's not so unrealistic; it's feasible that the F3-H4 stones will be cut off from the rest of the board, and have to make eyes in the corner.  J2 and H2 are vital points for doing so.

The question is whether white had read far enough to tell that the G7 group would be able to survive long enough to threaten the corner.  I'm not certain what the answer to this is (it's certainly beyond my abilities to read...)]
;B[hh]C[maybe rather h3 to strenghten white point's division from g5 group?
or g3

or play elsewhere, say g8?
white's move at g8 suggests the latter, but is there a way in which j2 unanswered could be dangerous?

[yip\]
If black g8, white may be able to cause complications with the combination of E6 and E4, while also threatening to live in the lower right.  Black's territory on the upper edge would be huge, though.

H3 seems weak; it doesn't really accomplish anything except to connect strong stones with each other.  It actually makes J2 more effective, since J2 would be sitting on an important point for eyes.  With H2, black has more possibilities.

I'd probably ignore J2 and just connect the stones together with G8.  Unless white is planning to use some aji to reduce black's territory while expanding from the left side, I'm not sure what white's plan is.]
;W[gb];B[he];W[hd]
(;B[hb]C[should be j5 instead

[yip\] J6, maybe?

I don't think it matters, though:  white can always cut through the F7 stones.

H8 was definitely a mistake, though.  Better at F6, forcing white to live in the corner, then attacking the left side.]
;W[ha];B[id];W[ib];B[cb]C[since white g8 group was now secure I decided to conquer some plain territories

I think it was now better than struggle for the black to stay as one group]

;W[ed];B[af]C[[yip\]
D2 is bigger; it helps to expand and stabilize the lower left group, reduces white's territory, and has good followups.  White isn't going to be in a hurry to play B6 (it's gote for white right now), so there's a good chance black will still be able to play A4 later.]

;W[gg];B[gh];W[gf];B[hg];W[eg]C[hadn't I run out of time, I would have definitely played f1
and I think it would give this group a  chance of certain survival

then I guess he would do d2
which would be followed by my h1
or vice versa (miai is the name for this), but less likely

My forecast calculations say black could have won by 2.5

[yip\]
Given that there is no komi, it would be close.  I think black would win by a small amount, though,]
