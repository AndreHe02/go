AB[cc][pd][pp][dq]SQ[cc][dq]C[Hello

A very unusual handicap game.  Neither side seem to follow conventional handicap style and the result seems almost random at times.

I think the clearest indication of the above can be seen in the positioning of the handicap stones.  Traditionally the marked stones are on the star points.

I hope that my comments are helpful and provide some insight into improving your go playing skills

Any questions or concerns feel free to e-mail me.

Cheers,
MadRussian]N[This is a bit of a weird game somehow. I think My mains errors
are in the opening, maybe I need to be more offensive when I play against
handicap. Thanks for the review]PL[W]
(;W[qq]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[This is incorrect.  White is only strengthening black with this move.

Something like A or B is better.  
I would play A instead of B because of the pressure the stone at D3 would place on B.]

It's a bit difficult for white to gain from this corner as blacks got a decent moyo going and white does not have a lot of influence directed at it.

Personally I think any of the lettered positions are better than C3 (had black stomped out white).  Note that it would probably be a battle for life if white were to play here, but that's expected in a handicap game... Black is ahead and white has to fight to gain the lead back]

Overall, I think black was too concerned with trying to kill white as opposed to building a moyo.  White didn't try and build influence but rather just tried to invade black.  With that type of strategy, the best white could hope for was a major mistake by black to win the game.

Handicap games cannot be calm and causal for white or else white will lose.  White needs to take a couple of calculated chances and learn to exploit the weakness that black is going to leave.]
