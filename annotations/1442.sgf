C[Hi,
I played W here. But the guy who played B asked that this game be reviewed
by someone with higher level. So, there are more questions from him.
I
only put a few questions here, but I'm more interested in the weakness of
my style of play, or could I have done better in certain moves, etc.

I'm andre, I'll do my best in reviewing your game. 
I
made tons of variations.Reviewing for both side requires me to made these
many and long variations. The number of points i mentioned during reviewing
is the points a side got not a difference point. for a difference point,
multiply it by 2.];B[dc];W[qd];B[dq]
(;W[fp]TR[oc][od]SQ[ce][de][cf][cn][co][do]C[I
question this move, an empty corner is always a bigger move than an attack
at opponent's opponent's corner but there are some cases when you attack
first enemy's corner but usually it's on a corner near yours such as upper
left corner. This move is better at Squared point (if you insist on attacking
at beginning but black will attack upper right corner at either P16 or P17

Weiss: I think B made at least two mistakes which seem
fatal, had he didn't make those mistakes, would it be harder for me? Ow and
like I said in the beginning, I really appreciate if you can comment on my
style of play.

Thank you.

Andre :
Allright... here's my conclusion

Black
likes tenuki a lot, usually this is because he got his knowledge from replaying
pro's game. He is lack in reading big points. He doesn't recognize any overplay
yet which should give him more & more territory. And black always plays
smaller than he should have.

White likes doing overplay, he is better
than black, and would be better without the overplays. Your reading of Live&Death
problems is about average, and should study more. And your style of play...
your opening rather weird, you intend to take side rather than attacking
corner, this may cause your opponent to play shimari to secure his corner

Both
of you has the potential of getting better, just play and study more. Read
my other reviews for basic principle which I don't include here. And because
both of you still below 14k, try mastering standard opening before using
non basic opening. I recommend mastering San Ren Sei, Mini Chinese, Chinese
& Classic Honinbo Opening. There are many non basic and powerful opening
such as Daigo, Shin Fuseki, Cosmic and you should be able to master them
easier if you have mastered the basic opening.])
