C[glui: I am 2K(IGS) playing black and my oponenet is also 2k(IGS) playing white. I won the game due to my opponent "passed" too early. 
*** mmh, not sure (see variations)

This is a interesting  game to me. I would like to have my honourable reviewer to give me comment on how to make use of moyo.
Thank you in advance for your kindly comment.

;W[qf]C[glui: I hate W18 as I always donot know what to do here. If I play o16 white will build a huge teritory on the right. If I play around q12/r12,  this stone would under a big pressure from the lower right white thick wall.
********
The usual answer is O17 (see var 1 & 2), but O16 is also played sometimes (see var 3). 
I think it's not good to invide now.
Black has no reason to be afraid of the right w territory: it's widely open at the top and there is some aji with black stone at R6.]

;B[mh];W[ni]C[glui: I played the next ten moves as I believe no matter what I did, white can have the right side as his territory. So I tried to build my moyo in compensate. Am I right ?
*******
No, I think it's bad to fix w territory like that without other atlernative.
Your moyo is too widely open and, after the sequence, a good move like N4 or M5 has no meaning.
Here I prefer to play G17 for exemple (see var).];B[mi];W[nj]

C[glui: is the B47 a right move at the right time?
******
I think it's too late (see earlier comments)];B[dj]C[glui: I didnot follow the W46 because I though white would not gain much on the lower side due to the Blank 15-17. Am I right?

Yes];W[km];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[il];W[hm];B[hl];W[kq];B[gm]

C[glui: I didnot like the Black79 but I have no choice as I want to settle these black stones before I do anything else. But by B79, white also settled its conner ? Any suggestion ?

now, E3 is needed.];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr]C[Here Black can play the variation]

C[glui: At this moment I realy didnot know what to do next. How to keep my moyo? 1) I donot want to play around jk16 nor cd13. Hence, I play c9 first and then c17. Then wait for white invasion. Is this a right startegy.
*****
see var from move 82.
Otherwise black could play E9 to be coherent with the next sequence after w invasion.]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[cc];W[ic];B[gc]C[glui; is B95 a right move
***

yes, i think so.];W[lc];B[le]C[glui: is B97 a right move?

Sometimes N18 better, but here with kikashi at N15 I think it's ok.]

(;B[kc]LB[ej:A]C[this move is for sealing w alife (see var from 98 to try to kill).
Moyo is a strategy to attack and kill if you can.
Here with the moyo open at A, black need to seal w sente at least.
So for your plan, C9 is a mistake.];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb];B[id]

As you can see in var there is nothing here back can do.
