AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Thanks in advance for commenting this game. I'll try to explain what was the reason for some of my moves and from your remarks I hope to learn if I payed attention to the right things here and what more important things I overlooked.


First off, you are welcome, and as soon as you feel comfortable please return the favor by review a game for someone else. Second I would like to comment on playing against computers in general. I recommend playing computers as a last resort in train your go sense. It is not a great habit to get into, assuming your goals involve playing good go against actual people. I do not intead offense, only to suggest that your go would possibly progress more quickly were you to play other people.

I will mention this: I am commenting on this game my first time through, so I do not know what is going to happen. My concepts will be focused on general concepts that can help make begining players stronger, and so even though I may be wrong in my analysis, the concepts are solid; taught to me by stronger players who in turned learned from even stronger players and so on. Basically this advice will be more abstract and concept related. I hope it helps with what you are trying to accomplish through your game.]
PL[W];W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[the basic concepts that this move ignores:

1.) Corner first, side second, center last. The move at D6 is more of a center oriented move. Basically, this is the last place you need to be playing. even though there are joseki that work this way, our goal should be to get these basic concepts down before deviating from them.

2.) Touching a weak stone. D6 might seem like a sever attack or at least a pressuring move. But one of the things it does is force white respond, making the white formation stronger. If wish to have the viable option of attacking a group or individual stone later, you do not want to touch it directly

3.) Playing aggressively while ahead. If you look at the whole board it is a 6 to one battle right now. There is no reason for black to push so hard on white in this position. It is important to remember that you cannot prevent your opponant from gaining something and that if you are ahead your goal should be to defensively shore up your position in a way that gains you more than your opponant]
;W[dm]
(;B[em]TR[cg][ci][mq]C[This probably was not necessary now. Maybe I should have played somwhere else now, like the triangles. Pushing white this way gives him a good group close to the edge.

None of the triange spots are bad moves. E7 being neccessary here is not the problem i see with the play. because you attached to the stone, the natural instinct is to hane. White becomes stronger.

is to play a more solidly defensive move. As soon as you touched the stone at C6 you declare that your intentions are not to kill and that white would be succesful in this  area. From that respect you want to play away, however leave an atari/cut so close to the LL corner is not a great thing. E7 doubles whites options for ataris and cuts, give white the opportunity to push you around some.

Basically it is the same as before. even though it seems aggressive this play is strengthening white. and assuming correct play on whites part, white will gain a lot while you build more weaknesses for white to attack later. (see variation)]
;W[dl];B[el];W[gp];B[lq]C[After white playin G4 I did not have much hope for gaining a lot in lower left corner, so I decided to work on not letting white gain a lot in the bottom.

I disagree with the not much hope part G4 is weak and alone, and if the space is limited its seems likely that black can gain a lot by harrassing that stone. M3 isnt close enough to Q4 to make a strong shimari, and it is not close enough to G4 to take away possibility of a base.

I think here i would play the more aggressive moves of j3 keeping a careful eye on the cuts at E6 and D5. even if black only just lives in a small corner the gains from pushing white up against that corner could be great for black.]
;W[pm];B[qn]C[again touching a weak stone, but the corner 1st idea is good]
;W[qm];B[fq]C[this is good, but it also shows some conflict in your direction. if you decided that you didnt have a chance for a corner and played away,  coming back to it before the tenuki area is settle seems very indecisive. Try to do one thing at a time.

Also here again you touch a weak stone.];W[gq];B[qg]C[this move is similar to M3 to far to be defensive not far enough to be offensive.]
;W[fc]
(;B[cg]LB[hc:B][cg:A]C[See the variation. This is the sequence I play quite often against GNUGo. What do you thing about it?

The variation is good but please see my earlier pincer variation. playing on the second line in that scenario just isnt worth it at this point in the game. being as white left weak groups all over the board the pressuring aspect of the pincer is correct, although i think in this case the open skirt that variation ends with is a serious liability.


you seem to use the large knights move a lot. this is NOT a secure shimari. while a computer might ignore it, a human play that knows this will exploit it. stick with the basic shimari for enclosing a corner  when you are trying to do so.]
;W[ic];B[mc]CR[cc][qc][cq][qq]LB[ci:1][qi:3][jq:2]TR[en][do]
SQ[oc][ce][qe][nq]C[Still trying to prevent white from building a large base on any of the edges.


remember to share, it is a huge part of this game, if you try to prevent white from gaining anything you will great weakness like the cuts marked as triangles, the thin spots marked as squares and the invasion points marked as circles.

believe it or not all of those are weaknesses, Also white has been left with the opportunity to build  adequate bases all over the board at the numbered places.

so pretty much even though it looks as if black has covered a larger area white is actually not so bad here, because black tries to hard to keep white from getting anything, he forgets to make what he takes solid. I really hope this makes sense, it took me a long time to understand these concepts. (even though they are so basic) but just by watching for the the things discussed so far your go will increase incredibly]
;W[qj];B[cj]C[This was done with a direct attack at the D7 group in mind. Unfortunately the attack was not done well and maybe even costed me the game.]
;W[co];B[do];W[bq];B[cq]C[This is the move I regret. White is trying to get to the corner and I should have let him - I did not count on much in that corner already. I think that this is the moment when I should have played B8. Playing it one move later was too late.]
;W[dk];B[bl]C[I guess that now I should have played E10  to limit white's perspectives or maybe F11 to keep my groups connected and threaten the relatively week top group of white stones.

I like the move you made better than either E10 or F11, it presures white to make eye space and it is side first gain some security for your UL group. This is a good dual purpose move]
;W[br];B[cr]C[right];W[ek];B[cm]C[I just did not count the consequences of this move. I played this sequence badly and this costed me some points. A6 would probably be much better but still not in this phase of the game.]
;W[bn];B[ei]C[in reference to C7 cut  here was the mistake. and it is one that can be solved by reading and basic concepts yet again. first this is a center first move, we want corner first, side second, and center last.

Secondly if you read out the progression/liberties etc of the involved groups a play at b9 here keeps your formation safeish and keeps the pressure on white  by maintaining the cut , when this little fight was over you lost more than a few stones, infact the cut itself was more valuable IMO that twice what you lose here

after this I think I will save comments for response to your queries or restatement of the concepts already covered. I believe and hope that the basics already covered in this review should be enough to keep you occupied with progressing your game for awhile.]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[bk];B[gl];W[db];B[bc]C[C17 reduces the unecesary weakness of this nights move and accomplishes the same thing.]
;W[jq];B[gj]C[I'm not sure why white did not use the E9 group to attack the centre and allowed me to build those stones around his group. If I was playing white I would certainly try to connect this group to the top group thus putting presure on my upper left group and on the centre.]
;W[oj];B[nh]C[I tried to keep as much territory as I can in the corners (the GNUGo program is much stronger than me when direct fights come out) and keep my groups connected preventing white from getting a large territory in the centre.


keep in mind that both the right side corners are still very open and succeptible to invasion. Even though they might look like blacks right now the lower right is actually starting to look quite weak.]

;W[pb];B[ob];W[rf];B[rg];W[qb];B[oe]C[This is wasted move but the whole sequence seems ok for me. I gave up the corner (some 10-12 points for white) but earned a strong wall giving me good perspectives in the top right area.

first P15 is not a "wasted" move itis just gote. And with the bottom right corner still open to invasion I think you can see how black is being forced through the weaknesses we covered earlier into a smaller and smaller area.

NOTE: 10-12 pts is what  white potentialy gained. The lost is actually much higher than that as the same area if you remove the white stones is  closer to 20 pts for black.]
;W[cs];B[ds];W[bs];B[er];W[go]
(;B[gr]C[I'm not sure about this move - probably not worth it. It was better to try to limit the Q7 white group now. Do I have a good move now that limits both white groups in the bottom right area (Q7 and G5)?

I agree that G2 is slow and not especially sever at this point in the game. But again, thinking more about gaining territory or protecting your own area is more important than limiting your opponant. IF you can pressure your opponant in a way that benefits you that is best i would suggest M5 as a possibility (see variation)]
;W[hr];B[fs];W[cp];B[in]C[It's too easy to cut this stone from the M3 stone. Not perfect move I imagine.]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[ip];B[ko]C[these last few moves are great moves that usually only a computer will allow you to make.]

This is a process of reading which side is more valuable. A good rule of thumb: (yes again) corner first, side second, center last]

Its good that you see it, they say it takes 20 or so times to start noticing these things then another 50 before you are able to completely avoid them. so you are nearly there. Playing more will reduce these mistakes quickly]

This was not handled correctly, if you have a situation where you only need to respond under certain conditions, and your response is solid meaning safely avaialbe, you dont want to make it until you are forced to do so. This is more a matter of opinion though, as I will still ocassionly space off such things, and that can really hurt.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[I lost three corners in this game and allowed for huge white territory in the top left. I managed to keep all my groups connected as I wanted. And I lost the game probably because of taking care of small things when it was time for bigger actions. Dear reviewer, please advise where to put most pressure to improve my go skills. Thanks.


I enjoyed reviewing this game, and I think the answer is simple. Go is a game of balance. I think there is to much pressure in your game. I think you need to concentrate on playing what is safe and solid.

I also think it would be a great idea to learn when to and when not to fight, and the techniques for fighting.

I hope you are happy with the review, I look forward to seeing new games from you.

NOTE: when you first start trying to implement some of the simple things I covered your game will get weaker. Also I am sure you will notice a similar drop when learning to play against people rather than a computer. The most important lesson go teaches us, is to be patient and humble, and work hard through loss and sacrifice in order to gain the power of play we desire.]
