C[Hello Reviewer! Have fun with our game and please review for both sides.
I added variations and questions too.
Game info is correct.
(It was not a close game ,therefore no review needed for the final fight when white dies)
Thank you very much for your help

Hi guys, hope I can help you a bit!
I just had a look of your ranks on KGS so I will try to make the comments appropriate!
Phew finished, if you have any more questions about the game feel free to contact me on KGS (hotspur, amongst other aliases)]

See variations

This move is very unusual. Usually black only plays this if he has a very special reason.
In this case I think just jumping to F5 or diving in to the corner with C3 would both be good options.
However, I can't claim this move is unplayable =)];W[ip];B[gp]

(;W[jq]C[See variations

Is this move absolutely necessary?
If it were me I would like to avoid complications by playing at D6.
Depends how much you like learning josekies i guess =)];B[dn]

(;W[eo]C[See variations

So we are off joseki already :-p
Another reason for playing simple lines ^^
By the way, I am not trying to avoid fighting, quite the opposite infact. I like to get the corners out of the way as earlier as possible so that the real fighting can begin !!

I would be tempted to go straight for the corner here, white cant net black in so there is no rush to get out.]

(;B[hn]C[See variations];W[en]
(;B[dm]C[This move seems quite heavy. Now you are doomed to have to save D6.
I would be tempted to dive in to the corner or jump.

See variations];W[em];B[dl];W[eq]
(;B[er]C[See comments on variation];W[dr]LB[el:A][io:B]C[Hard to say whch is better.

Maybe you are correct and B is a little better. IF this is the case you should answer A with B.]

(;B[el]C[see variation]
(;W[oq]LB[gl:A][io:B]C[This is big but not urgent I think, better to try to attack blacks groups in lower left

I agree that A next is probably best for black.


IF you feel that A is too slow, can push at B first to protect it then answer in lower right (See Variation)

See variation]
(;B[cf]LB[gl:C][io:A][po:B]C[see variation

Not urgent at all.

Better to play at A, B or C

See variations];W[po]C[Quite big, seems nice for white.

C14 was small compared to this move];B[qo];W[pn];B[qm]
(;W[gm]C[see variation

I prefer this to F16. Firstly it uses you thickness to attack blacks weak group and inevitably turn the bottom in to territory.

Also, it stops the left hand side turning in to such a big moyo.

F16 would still be a powerful attack for black though, but where will he get the time for it with this group so weak?]
;B[gn]C[This seems like a thank you move, white is only to happy to answer]
;W[fl];B[jn];W[io];B[in];W[qn]C[Interesting idea, I wouldn't think it was time to leave the fight yet. But this is a nice asking move nevertheless. And it is hard to find white next move to attack so perhaps this is nice]

(;B[pq]C[this is quite crazy =)]
(;W[pr]LB[rn:B][op:F][nr:D][or:C][qr:A][ps:E]C[see variation

I agree that pushing through at S6 is very playable.

See var

This move looks odd also, but seems quite playable.
IF Black plays A the sequence to F seems likely, and is better for white than when he played S6 directly.

So Q2 seems like it might be ok.];B[rn];W[rm];B[rl];W[ro];B[sm]
;W[qq]C[Shame about the ladder =(];B[rp];W[pp]C[This result is of course nice for white than the joseki]

See var];B[lp];W[lq]
(;B[nm]C[Maybe a bit loose?

(;W[fj]C[I think it helps black

Its thick but maybe unnecessary as white is safe here for now

(;B[mp]C[Seems like black is starting an unnecessary fight.

See vars];W[nn]
(;B[mq]C[see variation

Black really doesnt want w to have anything =)

I think it would be good for the black player to look at the variation with the "wall of steel" and try to understand that that result is incredibly good for black.

There is no need to fear your oppo getting some points somewhere ^^]

This forces black to play a move that he wants to play.
And leaves you with a cutting point

It does indeed seem wrong, but I think it is ok cos white wont get enough unless he tries something crazy like this
