For the reviewer:

Hi, I am Arcin.

This was a game with reasonable time limits. I played White and won by 1.5. But as you will realize at the end, with a nice move black could have won because of my ignorance.

Anyway, this was a very close game. I tried to play the big points without getting lost in the small fights. I put some attention into the endgame, trying to maximize my chances.

Can you comment on my strategy overall? Did i make the right decisions, etc.


Hi, this is Dan, LungChing on KGS (3 kyu).  There's a lot here I can't comment on, so I'm going to request a review of my review.]
;B[pd]C[arcin [6k?\]: gl];W[dp]C[dreme3 [7k\]: thx, ^^ u too]
;B[pq];W[cd]LB[dd:A]C[Dan: Most common in pro games is A instead.  But your move is probably fine.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd];W[po]LB[qo:A]C[Dan: Good.  Also A is good.]
;B[np]LB[qm:A]C[Dan: Kobayashi plays A here instead.  This is the first time B didn't play a pro move.]

(;W[qj]C[Arcin:

Did not know what to play, so I played light. I know i invited an invasion at R7 or R8.

What is good way to play here?];B[qh]C[Dan:  This is a poor move because it asks White to solidify his overextension.]

(;W[no]C[Arcin: There was no invasion. so i decided to build a wall.

Dan: I'd probably play as in the variation.];B[mp];W[mo];B[op]
;W[oo];B[lo]LB[ck:A][qc:B][kp:C]C[Arcin : i believe he played wrong here. he could have played a much bigger move.

DRS: If I played tenuki, I'd probably play A or B.  Locally, I like C.]
;W[jq]LB[gq:A]C[Arcin: Extension + attack type move. I was not worried about an invasion around R7. I thought i had enough thickness to fight back.

Dan: I don't think this attacks a weak group.  Also Black can play A with dual purpose.]
;B[ln];W[nj];B[nh];W[jo]C[Arcin: I felt I had laid a bigger territory.

Dan: Looks nice to me.]
(;B[kp]C[Arcin: he did not need to defend here.];W[jp]C[Arcin: i am happier.

Dan: Agreed.];B[cm]C[Arcin: expected this move. otherwise it would be too late for him.]
;W[ck];B[cp]LB[bp:A]C[I probably would play A instead.  B doesn't feel all that strong, in which case it's best not to attach it.]
;W[co]LB[dq:A][co:B]C[After my pincer+extension at C9, i did not know how to play this move. I could also have blocked at C3. But then, we would have some strength and weaken my C9 stone, so I played like this.

Dan: I'd probably just extend at A.  It's a fairly normal thing to extend when you're atached.  B will also end up strengthening Black.]
;B[bo]
(;W[bp]C[Arcin: i am not sure whether this was a good move.

Dan: Please see variation.];B[cq];W[bn];B[bq];W[ao];B[dq];W[ep]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr]C[Arcin: This was a mistake];B[gq];W[fp]
;B[hr];W[aq];B[gs];W[gp];B[hp];W[ho];B[ei]C[Arcin: later on in the game I started to realize I was giving him all the sente.]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[hi]C[Arcin: he is nicely running out.]
;W[hg]C[Arcin: I had to do the same, otherwise he would have an immense presence at the top.]
;B[ji];W[mc]C[Arcin: just like his C7. if i waited more, it would be too late.]
;B[kc];W[ne]LB[pb:A][qc:B]C[How about A instead?  Or B?];B[oc]
;W[lf];B[ld];W[md];B[jg];W[pf]C[Arcin: desperately trying to live/link.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[og]C[Arcin: I am more stable.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[pl]TR[ph][qh][ln]C[Arcin: This was a good attack. He had the chance to use the marked black stones and go towards the size/corner.]
;W[pj]C[Arcin: Not sure this was the best move. Tried to block the link of the two black stones at the top with the single invasion stone AND link my top group. But the linking was not really there.

Dan: I think this is reasonable.];B[nm]C[dreme3 [7k\]: awful fight >_<

Arcin: actually i think he is doing good.];W[qq];B[qr];W[ql]
;B[qn];W[pn]C[arcin [6k?\]: it is getting widespread... everything is affected.]
;B[qo];W[qp];B[pp];W[qm];B[rq];W[ol];B[ih]C[Arcin: again he has sente.]
;W[di]LB[ci:B][ek:A][ch:C]TR[dp][ep][fq][fp][gp][co]C[Arcin: this is the biggest move I found. But the attachment was maybe not a good idea. Maybe at B ? But then we would play A and try to revive the single black stone.


Maybe I could also play at A for territory.

Dan: I like C if you want to connect.   But connecting two strong groups tends to be low priority.  I think it's too late to attack with the triangled wall, and A feels big at this point, so making territory from the wall seems reasonable right now.]

;W[fb]C[Arcin: In two cases he played an extra stone letting me keep sente. I believe this is how I close the gap. Actually i did not know I was behind. I tried to count a couple of time but never finished my counting.]

I tried my best trying to play the big moves, but he actually had more territory when the middle game was over. I cought up I believe only in the endgame because he played too passive.

This is the killer move.];W[bi]C[arcin: only white defence.

Dan: Sounds right.];B[cg]C[Arcin: black will die BUT while he dies white will play 2 extra moves in his territory :) considering white won by 1.5, I would actually lose by 0.5]
