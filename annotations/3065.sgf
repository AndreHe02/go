AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,
thank you by advance for reviewing my game.
i think i have a big lack in strategy. i already had a few games reviewed by stronger player and usually they just say that here or there i made a mistake but it doesn't help me much because i can usualy understand those mistake alone.
Let's say what i would like to get by this review is more :"how to play better" than "why i've played bad". I want to understand better how to make stronger groups and how not to let my opponent have strong groups.
I'll ask you some questions within the game.
Thank you very much.

Hi,

I hope you will find this review useful. You can contact me by email or on KGS (I'm linfir) if you have any further question.

I didn't comment on the yose (endgame), because it is fairly technical (and I'm not very good at it), and I think it is not the main issue in this game.

This is a bit too nice for white];W[cc];B[hd];W[jc]
(;B[ic]C[Is it a good answer?
was n17 better maybe?
why?

-- 

J17 looks very submissive. I don't like it for two reasons : first, contact moves are best used to defend when you are in difficult situations (and also in josekis); second it's better to go out to the center than to try to keep at all cost what you think as your land, because here it is small (a bit more than 10 points).

I'd prefer M17 (see variation) or maybe N17.];W[jb]
(;B[ib]C[-- 
This is bad ; your stones look overconcentrated. It's better to go directly at K16.]
;W[mc]
(;B[jd]TR[ib][jb][ic][jc]C[I played that because i read a go proverb that say that in this position( the marked stones) this move is usaully the biggest in the board.
Is that move correct here?

-- 

No, I don't think so. The logical followup (see variation) is not good for black.

It's probably better to attack a bit the white stones at P17 for example (see variation) and make some profit in the corner.]
;W[kd]
(;B[qn];W[qf];B[qe]LB[pj:A]C[-- 
It is bad. You should play the tsuke (R15) only if there is a black stone around A. Because now it is too easy for white to live there.]
;W[rf]LB[pf:A]C[-- 
This is a bad move, the normal move is at A.]
(;B[re]LB[pf:A]C[-- 
A would be much better ; then white would be struggling just to live.]
;W[jp]TR[qf][rf]C[-- 
This is terrible; the two white stones must be defended first.]
;B[lp]LB[pf:A]TR[qf][rf]C[-- 
It is better to attack the two white lone stones; A is very painful for white. You don't have to kill them, just make some profit in sente, then come back to play on the lower side if you like.]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr]LB[mp:A]TR[ib][re]C[-- 
This is the third time you answer there, on the second line (the so-called "line of defeat" :o). This kind of move is better left for the yose (endgame). It is way too small right now. Locally, it's better to play at A.]
;W[kp];B[mp]C[i think m5 would have been better here.

-- 

Right.];W[fq];B[cn];W[ql];B[qj]LB[qi:A]C[-- 
Very good. Now white has two (very) groups. 
However, A is a bit better, because now the two white stones can't get a shape by playing at R12.]

(;W[ol];B[oj];W[of]C[o17 is a mistake  i guess...

-- 
No, not at all. It is retaliating to white, and that's a good thing to do, even if it leads to some fighting...]

(;B[oc]C[-- 
You should try to fight back a bit before defending. Fighting spirit is very important; you just can't win if you back away as soon as white threatens to attack... See the variation for an example of 'fighting back'.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[qi];B[pk];W[pl];B[ne]LB[ne:A][mk:B][nk:C]C[-- 
This move has no meaning. The fight is now happening elsewhere. If you play A, it is to kill the R14 group; I think it is a bit hard.

However, by playing at B or C, you can try to seal in the Q8 group, while getting you black stones out of danger.]
;W[ml];B[mj]C[-- 
Necessary.];W[nf]
(;B[dj]C[-- 
You can still attack!];W[jl]C[-- 
... too late.];B[pi];W[pf];B[nd];W[lf];B[je]LB[dq:A]C[-- 
Too small. A (for example) is bigger.];W[cl]LB[dj:A][cl:B]C[How to react to this move?
do i have to try to kill?

-- 
You don't have to kill, but just to make sure not to make it too easy for white.

You have to know, even approximatively, how to react to B at the moment you play A (move 44). If you find it difficult, maybe it's better to play one line closer (C9).]
;B[dl]C[-- 
This is the usual answer.];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj]LB[dm:A]C[-- 
Here, white made a mistake; he should have cut instead. Thus, black can safely connect at A.]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[ch]TR[di][dm]C[-- 
This is bad. There are two cutting points now. Having one was a bit annoying, but now it is dangerous.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dm];B[fj];W[cm];B[dn]LB[cq:A][dq:B]C[-- 
It doesn't defend the corner very well (what do you do against A ?). It's better to play at B for example.]
;W[em];B[ef];W[cg];B[bh];W[qq]
(;B[pq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]TR[mp][mq][mr]C[-- 
It isn't very easy, but I think that using the wall, and playing at A instead of B to push white on it, you can kill white. See variations.]
;W[qp];B[qo]C[is that too risky? (w can play q5)

-- 
No, it is not. If white cuts, you can kill the corner (see variation).]

(;W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[qs]LB[oo:B][rp:A]C[--
White seems alive, so it's better to play some yose sente at A, and then to connect at B.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[ps];B[os];W[qr];B[po];W[gm]
(;B[fo]LB[jj:A]C[Here i really don't know what to play, i guess this move is weak what would have been better?

-- 
Right, It doesn't do much. When you don't know what to play, look for :
 - weak groups (to attack or defend them)
 - big points

Here, I see: 
 - a black group which is a bit weak (Q10) and alone
 - a white weak group on the left side (Q8)
 - there is a lot of aji on the top left white group (see variations), so it is attackable.
However, not just right now because of black's weak group.
- and big endgame points in the lower left corner.


That's why I would play at A, to help the black group, and to prepare an attack on the top left.]

Good idea, but a bit late. And if white can avoid the cut by answerwing at A, and giving up two stones (the variation is showed move 84).]

You're welcome.
I think the biggest issue you have is that your play is way too timid. You don't attack, and almost always respond to white, letting him take the lead. In other words, I think you should develop your 'fighting spirit' ;o)

Bye,
