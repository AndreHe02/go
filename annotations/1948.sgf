GC[I tend to have a reoccuring problem of getting cut off (how white took that large area at the top/middle) in my games.  I was wondering if you see any problems in my joseki or just my play in general that would be causing this.  Also, since I very seldom play online im not sure what I should set my rank at on IGS.  Based on this game, do you think I should just leave it at 28k or go lower?  Any other observations/comments would be appreciated also.]


C[Hello David,

my comments will be marked by <tomjk> which is my nickname on IGS and KGS.
I hope you find my comments useful.

<tomjk> Summary:
Opening was characterized with prudent 3-3 play from which a whole board development is difficult.
Both players missed often the direction of play during opening (books like "In the Opening" might give useful hints where to play). White entered the middle game with a thin position. Black a little stronger, but some stones off place for future development.
In the middle game both players played often for small points. Black lost the opportunity to capture the upper left corner or at least attack it early in the game. As a result the upper black group gets very weak and barely survives. Black allows thus White to build considerable territory in the center and top by attacking this weak group.
Both players often miss vital points (here study of go problems or the "Tesuji" book should give some hints).
End game by White was better, as he consistently played more often the big points. Black responded too many times locally. Black should try to look out for "sente" moves which retain the initiative. Again Black missed some basic tesuji. A study on the topic could be beneficial.]
;B[od];W[cq];B[qq];W[cc]
(;B[jq]LB[ed:A][pp:B][pq:C]C[<tomjk> A looks more natural to me now. See variation. K3 would be good if R3 on B or C. Also K3 does not put any pressure on white.]
;W[po]C[<tomjk> good.];B[pj]LB[pl:A][op:B]C[<tomjk> too far away. White can now play at A and be happy. Playing ont B looks like a good idea to me and then wait what white does.]
;W[qd]C[<tomjk> this seems to be getting a complicated fighting game... :)]
;B[qe]C[<tomjk> good];W[de]C[<tomjk> white plays strange. now Black can attack the lone white stones with profit ...]
;B[dj];W[do]
(;B[dg]C[<tomjk> no urgence for Black to play here. He can if white D8, black D13; if white D13, black D7. This is called "miai" (two equivalent moves).
See variations for some ideas where to play elsewhere.];W[oq]
;B[qo];W[pc]C[<tomjk> White comes back to his two stones. Black has missed a chance here.]
;B[pd];W[lq];B[fr]LB[gq:A]C[<tomjk> A is normal];W[rd]
(;B[pe]LB[pe:B][pf:A][qf:C][fp:D]C[<tomjk> maybe at A would be better. Protects cut at B and C. See variation.

;B[be];W[gc]LB[dd:A]C[<tomjK> not good. Leaves the cut at A.]

(;B[jd]LB[ic:B][oc:A]C[<tomjk> good. Before could start wiht play at A for a strong wall, then later B. See variation.]
;W[cf]LB[dd:A]C[<tomjk> seems like an overplay. There is still the weakness at  A to fix first.]

(;W[hi]LB[ei:A]C[<tomjk> this move I do not understand. White should pull out his stones with A and Black is in big trouble. See variation.]
;B[fg]C[<tomjk> good! Captures also the four white stones.]
;W[li]LB[oc:A][pn:B]C[<tomjk> A looks bigger now for White. Also a very big point for Black. Also B is big.]
;B[jm];W[mf];B[md]LB[oc:A]C[<tomjk> better A - which forces White to live in the corner and gives a nice wall to Black.]
;W[kg]LB[fc:C][oc:A][re:D][pn:B]C[<tomjk> both players miss the big points at A, B, C and also D.]

(;B[kq]LB[kp:A]C[<tomjk> A connects and denies White the forcing move at B later. See variation.]
