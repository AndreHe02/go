C[ziggystar: Hello.

Andy:  Hello.  I will preface my remarks with A: so you know it is me.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[mq];W[pj];B[qg];W[qm];B[qo];W[mc]
C[A: Perhaps this move should have been closer to the corner.  It prompts black to make a shimari with an excellent extension already in place.  The two right hand corners leave behind for the rest of the game.  Blacked would have pincered, but you would have kept him from having an ideal corner.]
;B[oc];W[jc]C[A: Black seems concentrated, though in good form, while white seems light, which is also fine.  This move, k17, could usefully have been at k16 instead, I think.  To explain exactly why is above my rank, but a general rule is that have side stones mixed between the third and fourth lines is better.  All on the fourth line is invadable and all on the third line reaches out to the center too little.]
;B[ce]C[A:  Note how black has kept you from making a shimari.  Had you done the same in the upper right, it would have been a different game.]

(;W[ee]C[A:  In this sequence coming up, Black lets White get away with a lot.  White comes away with an excellent result, making it hard to critique.  But I might have considered a pincer.  Not C13, I think, but D10, D11 or D12.  If black jumps to E15, then F16 answers fine and black is constricted.  If black jumps further to F15, then G16 might be ok.  I am not sure.  You want to keep black constricted and uncomfortable there and that might be a way of doing it.  See variation starting last move.]
;B[bc]C[A: Lousy move that lets white contain black, keep the top and get lots of the side.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[cf];W[de]LB[ef:A]C[(White) A (E14) probably better

A: Saves a point later on, perhaps, but not a huge difference.  It achieves the main point of boxing black in.]
;B[cd];W[cl];B[fq]
(;W[hq]C[A: This pincer works out ok.  You seem to risk the corner to maintain it though.  Had black been more forceful, it might have turned out badly.  Also, his taking K3 seemed damaging in the long run.  Lastly, you forego the chance to make a big moyo.  Perhaps that is the biggest thing. Consider F6.  Big moyo.  Now black has to try to break you up, instead of the other way around.  See variation starting last move.]
;B[fo];W[ho];B[fm];W[hm];B[fk]C[A: Perhaps this is a chance for L3.]
;W[hk];B[df];W[eg]
(;B[cr]C[A: Too ambitious a jump by Black, well-handled by white.  There are a number of ways black can make profit or eye-space here.  This isn't one of them.  See variations starting last turn.]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[br];B[er];W[cs];B[jq];W[hr]C[A: A good move by white.  Black's feeble response gives white some profit later.]
;B[gr];W[gq]C[A: This is not so great.  You are not looking to kill black, but to have good groups yourself and to limit black.  It is true that this pressures the black group, but N14 or peeping at E6 or L4 do much more for the game.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[do];W[co];B[ep]C[A: Don't fill.  If he takes, you go B4 and it is fine.  This is a chance for a big move, like D10 or N14]
;W[cp];B[dj];W[el];B[fl];W[dm];B[em];W[ek];B[ej]C[(white) Maybe a cut at F10 would now be adequate?
My next move is somewhat stupid, because I misread the board and thought I could prevent black from getting an eye at E5.

A: The cut at F10 would be great, getting you, in all probability, a good chunk of stuff on the left and forcing black to spend a few stones on making eyes.  Without the cut, denying black eyes is sort of beside the point, because black can escape.  Your goal here is not to kill black outright, but to capitalize on the fact that black is pouring stones into a position that gets him no territory, gets you 20 or more points on the left and influence on the right.  The cut gets you 20 more points and black has to put at least 2-3 more stones in to live.  I try out some variations, and while black can certainly live, the cut is the best thing.]

(;W[eo];B[en]
(;W[cj]C[A: You could still have cut here, even though black is now alive.  The profits of that cut would have been big, I think, either on the left or on the top.]
;B[gj];W[ii]C[A: This is not a good move.  It does not threaten any of black's positions.  It does not create or extend your claims on territory on the top.  It does not give your center group either eyes or territory and it does not even connect it to the top or the right side.  (black H10, white J10, black j9.)  The black position in the two right side corners and the bottom gives him a good shot at a lot of territory.  You need to press him down and claim your own.  In the end, your center group gets as compacted and useless as his left center group is.  Lastly, it prompts black to move into territory that you want to claim.  Try H13 or G12 or L4 or N14 or N13 or ...]

;B[hj];W[ij];B[eh];W[jk];B[ck];W[bk];B[dk];W[cm];B[dl];W[ci]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[dd];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[eb];W[fb];B[db]C[A: The following exchange of moves is way too slow for white.  Why not J15 instead?  Or why not some big move in the middle.  You have a big wall there but not claim on territory at all.  Why not L4?]

(;W[hf];B[ig];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[kh];W[kn]C[A:  Not an ambitious move.  You are behind in territory now. You have things could can be doing based on the sides or corners, stretching out on the right or top, invading the lower right corner, pressing down the bottom to make at least a bit of a framework.  This move tries to carve out profit in the center.  Carving out profit from the center is the hardest thing to do if there is not some other aspect or threat or fighting to give you some leverage.  Look at black's next move.  Get's him some potential profit, limits your scope and prompts you to make a defensive move.]
;B[mn]C[A: I suspect that the center white group is alive.  It is the group on the right that needs help.  This would also be a good time to try an invasion at R3.  You can probably get a ko out of it.]
;W[ll];B[nl]MA[pj][jk][ll][qm][kn]C[(white)I wanted to connect these stones. But it seems that it was too far. But they could live on their own.]

;W[on];B[jo];W[jn];B[ln];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[mo];B[mm]
C[A:  Black has succeeded in limiting your effort to get territory in the middle with a long threatening spindle.]
;W[oh]C[A: S11 might have been better here.  You can still get into black's area from the top.]

;B[in];W[im];B[io];W[hn];B[jj];W[jl]C[(black) Endgame begins now. I'd be glad if you could point out situations where I could have played a better oppurtunity first.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[rn];B[ro];W[ks];B[ls]LB[js:A]MA[jq][kq]
[mq]C[(white) This monkey jump went quite bad for me. I was confused by the marked stones and the unusual answer.
Next stone should have been A (K1) I think. Could have costed me the win.

A:  The monkey jump was perfect. You are exactly right that the follow up should have been k1.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[lr];B[mr];W[gs];B[fr];W[bg]C[A: Perhaps B12 in sente instead.]
;B[bf];W[ji];B[kj];W[pg];B[pf];W[od];B[pd];W[nc];B[pc];W[qh]
;B[rh];W[ph];B[rf];W[pi]C[A: This move is one point gote at best.  B12 would be better there]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[dh];W[fg];B[ag];W[di];B[ei];W[ai];B[ah];W[hi]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[fi];W[mh]C[A: I don't think was a great move.  It doesn't get you anything and winds up costing you the point you won at Q11.]
;B[ni];W[lh];B[ki];W[nh];B[mi];W[qn];B[oi];W[lp];B[lq];W[kg]
;B[jh];W[ik];B[mp];W[op]LB[qq:A]MA[qo][pp][oq]C[(white) This is another bad move by me. I wanted to press against the marked stones, so that black has to play a stone at A. Black had the correct answer for this.]

[ss]C[Result:
Black: 73
White: 68.5

A: It is hard to review, because you both played near my level, so I am sure I missed many things.   Both players played slowly and tentatively, not taking big risks.  Both players built big, wasteful, tentative groups in the center, but with black having three corners, it was just enough to put black ahead.  Nonetheless, either side could have won this and it came down to endgame play.  There were a few fluffed endgame moves, but the monkey jump fluff decided it.

Hope this helps.  All the best.  Andy.])
