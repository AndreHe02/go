AB[pd][dp]C[I would like to submit this game for review. I'm mainly interested in comments about the fuseki and what B could have done about the large W mojo that formed in the top left after move 57.

Many thanks in advance,
-Ives


Hello,

I've marked all my comments "Rev:" for reviewer.  I think the most important issues in this game are issues of shape - that is, when you can take advantage of your opponent's shape, and how to play secure shape yourself.  The bottom right corner is the most telling example in this game.

Also, you need to develop a better sense for the big opening points.  White pretty much beat you to the biggest points consistently.  An easy guide to the biggest point is to count the number of open spaces between positions.  For example, to play between a 3-4 point and a star point is somewhat bigger than playing between two star points, and if a 3-5 point is facing down the side towards a 4-4 point, the area on that side is not attractive early on.

Finally, be wary of trying to make secure territory around a star point.  It is very tough to secure the corner efficiently.]

(;W[dc];B[pq];W[df]C[Rev:  This is an unusual enclosure, both high and a little loose.  If white ends up basing a moyo around it, you should aim to invade rather than reduce from the outside in most cases.  White probably plays this way because he expects, as the stronger player, to be more familiar with how to deal with it.]
;B[kd]C[Rev:  This is a big area, but the right side is bigger.  I would prefer to grab the enclosure in the bottom right, or try a chinese-style opening.  If you must play here, it is probably better to extend one point farther - it still leaves you a comfortable amount of space if white invades between your stones, and it is a more severe reduction of white's influence.  In any case, the right side is definitely the bigger area since it is one point wider.]
;W[po]C[Rev:  The biggest point on the board.  You can consider a pincer to try to make use of your high stones on the top.]
;B[qo]C[Rev:  This is almost never bad, aiming to take secure territory.]

(;W[pp]C[Rev:  White wants to create complications by playing an avalanche-type joseki.]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]LB[pn:C][qn:D][qq:A][or:B]C[Rev:  I can't see anything immediately wrong with this, however the usual moves are at A, B, C, and D.  A keeps things simple and takes territory, and B is fairly similar.  C and D aim at starting fights.  This move doesn't really improve on A much, and it leaves you with some bad aji in the corner that white may capitalize on later.]
;W[or]C[Rev:  This is a little slow by white, I think, since it doesn't protect the cut and leaves you with the hane on top.  However, it seems he had a plan to exploit your shortage of liberties.]

(;B[qm]C[Rev:  Your shape with this move is too thin.  If you want to just move out, extending is enough and is thicker shape.  A hane (at the head of two stones) also looks possible.]
;W[qn]TR[or][pr]C[Rev:  White is trying to take advantage of the marked exchange, which lost you liberties.  Check the variation.]

(;B[rn]C[Rev:  This is too submissive.  You have to atari on top if you want to get any kind of a good result here.]
;W[pn];B[rq];W[jp]LB[pm:B][op:A]C[As black, I was not pleased with this result. It seems I got a small corner and white got himself lots of influence *and* a big piece of territory... right? What would have been a better way to play in the bottom right?

Rev:  See my comments on the preceding moves.  Also note that white is not completely secure here yet, as the cut at A depends on a ladder.  The ladder works now, but it may not work later, so you can aim at cutting here.  Also because of this cut pushing up at B is strong and forcing - see the variations.  Because of the sequences I show there you shouldn't have any trouble reducing white's territory here.]

(;B[pi]LB[qf:A]C[Rev:  This is loose.  You are too low nearby to make efficient use of this stone.  It is better played closer to the corner - A is conceivable.]
;W[hc];B[hp]LB[pm:B][gq:A]C[What's more important here: to stay away from W thickness, or to prevent a big extension around f4/g4 for white?

Rev:  You can do both, if you play slightly closer to the corner - at A for example, or the small knight's move.    This move is an idea, though, since it aims at the push at B I showed earlier.]
;W[jn];B[ol]LB[ch:A]TR[pi]C[Rev:  This move misses the shape point, and it is too close to the marked black stone.  In any case, the left side is much larger now.  A looks good, aiming at plunging into white's loose corner if white pincers, or making a moyo in the lower left if white defends the corner.]
;W[pm];B[ql];W[pl];B[pk];W[rm];B[rl];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[mi]
;W[nj];B[ni]C[I was quite happy with this result. Looking forward to a nice chunk of territory at the top right. But how to defend it in the next moves?

Rev:  The upper right is still too loose to be considered territory.  White can probably plunge straight into the 3-3 point and get a good result, since you will be heavily overconcentrated.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[nd];B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[qd]C[Rev:  White is aiming to make things complicated.]
;B[qe];W[rd]
(;B[rc];W[od];B[pe];W[nf]C[Rev:  This is a reasonable sequence for you, since white is far from secure yet.  However you must worry about your isolated stone.]

(;B[oc]C[Rev:  This isn't a good idea, it's too easy for white to sacrifice this stone.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[nc];B[qb];W[kf]LB[jf:A]C[Rev:  You can't afford to sacrifice this stone, white's area is too big.  A is a thought for getting out, white is too thin to keep you completely enclosed.  You will be attacked though, and severely.]
;B[dk]TR[ch][ci]C[Rev:  This is a little tight, since white can play at either of the marked points for an efficient corner territory.  You have lost the chance to exploit white's loose enclosure.]
;W[hf]C[And now I got scared. This w framework looks immense. Can B still attack or reduce it? If so, where to start?

Rev:  It is possible, but difficult now.  The top left corner can still be invaded.  Pulling out your stone after white plays here looks very tough, but you can surely get some forcing moves.]
;B[hn]LB[ch:A]C[Rev:  This is a good point, but A is much bigger.]
;W[go];B[ho];W[do];B[co];W[dn]LB[cn:A]C[Rev:  White is again trying to make trouble here.  Keep calm about it.  A is the best response here.  After this things get a little out of hand.]
;B[fk];W[ep];B[dq];W[cn];B[eq];W[cp]C[Rev:  You can extend once in response to this, then sacrifice both stones for forcing moves (cf white's sacrifice in the top right).]
;B[eo]LB[fp:A]C[Rev:  A is better.  Keeps your stones unified.]
;W[fp];B[fn]LB[fq:A]C[Rev:  A is safer.  You run the risk of cutting yourself in half this way.]
;W[fq]C[Rev:  This is a very important point for both - it makes your stones short of liberties and is separates you.]
;B[cq];W[bo];B[fr];W[gn];B[fm];W[gm]TR[fm][fn][gn][hn][go]C[Rev:  This is awful shape for you, allowing white to slice clean through like this.  When this happens you can be sure something has gone terribly wrong.]
;B[bp]C[Rev:  This stone is not important, especially since white can do horrible things to your cutting stones.  See the variation for one way.]

(;W[gr];B[er];W[gq];B[im];W[gl]LB[fl:A]C[Rev:  It's hard to justify not playing A next, since if white plays there his stones are completely secure.]
;B[nl]
(;W[iq];B[jm];W[lm]C[Rev:  Silly move, loose shape.];B[op]C[Rev:  The cut doesn't work immediately, so it may be better to hold it in reserve]
;W[nm];B[ml]TR[op]C[Rev:  White can, and probably should, capture your marked stone at this point.]
;W[mm];B[om];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[ll];B[lk]
;W[lp];B[kk];W[lq];B[mr]C[Rev:  Locally, it is better to play this move one point to the right.]
;W[lr];B[os];W[jl];B[kl];W[km];B[ik]LB[hm:A]TR[hn][ho][hp]C[So I managed to get the group at O9 *and* P3. More than I hoped for. And I have more influence in the center. But I still didn't know how to play at the top...

Rev:  Note that white can still play at A to capture your three stones, or cut them all off.]
;W[fl];B[el];W[em]C[Rev:  See the variations.  There is enough space in the top left to invade and get a living group or an outside reduction.]

;W[ap]C[Ouch :^/.

But would B have had a chance without this unfortunate mistake from W?

Rev:  In short, yes, I think so.  Black is behind before this, but not by so much by kyu standards.  If you get life in the top left corner you are ahead.  My comments end here.]

Also, if you don't connect your stones on the bottom white can cut those off too.  Finally, keep in mind that this sequence gave you an extra move locally, so white got a move elsewhere.  This should be enough, I think, to convince you that going for that stone was a bad idea.]
