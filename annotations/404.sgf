;B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[qm];B[rl]C[Is 15 joseki for the high Chinese opening?  I don't know, and you can look it up, but I would not want to induce W to play at p7 since it may be better for B to play there - especially since B's fuseki moves 5 and 7 are high

I would consider something like f16 or c10];W[om];B[nk];W[ml]
C[W 18 cannot be right - inducing B to build an even stronger, thicker wall to play well with his top formation.  I think  W needs to look at something like N5 or O5 of P4 - I haven't read out the full fight, but any of these should work well given the weaknesses in the lower black group]
;B[dj]C[Timing is off.  I would continue to push at N9 - build that wall and chase white as long as you can.  From this distance the effect on the lower B group is marginal - it is already blocked in - and can be made to live.

I also like C10 instead of D10 here - it doesn't  play that well with the upper right and since w is high, b should be low - in general.]
;W[ce]C[I think this is wrong - the shimari is facing B strength and has limited development chances.  What W would like to do would be to get the double wing from the hoshi in the lower left.  So W at C7, B at C14, W at G17 or something like that.]
;B[cn]C[This is correct, though it is possible that the high move is better here - but Iike the lower one here.]
;W[fq]C[W 22 has to be wrong.  W already has a stone on the side - and B is thin  -invadeable at c8 or d8 - so if w wants to reach out this direction, W should play F4.  I personally like the contact play, D6 which makes b overconcentrated as it is played out and plays well with the starpoint stone on the bottom and the stone on N8.]
;B[ch]C[This seems wrong to me.  E6 reinforces B's left side formation and has an effect on the center and the W group.  Also, W's best extension from the shimari is along the top - so that is where B wants to play - "my opponent's best play is my best play" - something like  g17.

The b group on the side has plenty of flexibility and so needs no immediate reinforcing.]
;W[qf]C[White is faced with a problem here.  If w extends from the shimari now, it seems small and strengthens B's stone on K16.  But that would be ok since the 3-3 invasion in the upper right is still available.

I think better would be the extension around g17, B K14, W R17 - joseki played out  -

then a light reduction by W somehwere around m12 - or maybe the push at N9 before the reducing move.]
;B[qh]C[Wrong direction.  Take the corner and make W run or live small on the side.  So 15 should be either R16 or R17 followed by B S15 and B 016 - the b side group can be treated lightly - and run to the top, left, or live.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[lq]C[I thin a reducing move is more urgent here, O12 looks right - perhaps a forcing move like P10 first.]
;B[oc]C[B should not ignore w 36.  The bottom group is now in danger - unnecessarily.]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[pb];B[mc]C[This is very poor B overwhelms W in this area and ends up in gote?  Leave the aji behind - the push on B 37 was wrongly timed.  BTW, if b plays n17 before the push, B gets almost the same result in sente.]
;W[nr]C[Study this.  The right move is W42 at P2.  Play it out a number of ways to learn why.  B may live, but most painfully.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[oq];W[op];B[ns];W[ms];B[os];W[lr];B[bp];W[cq]
;B[gc]C[B is getting all the big points here - w is getting pushed around.  But B could consider E6 to flatten the w group and build his own or n9 is still huge - or M10.  By giving w the corner, B has staked the game on the b center  - not on the b top side and now must look after it. so 53 is probably not the biggest move right now - though it looks very big]
;W[en]C[This is big, but reducing B's moyo with a move around M10 is the most urgent thing.]
;B[lj]C[this is good];W[cl];B[dl];W[dm]C[There are josekis for this situation - and these need to be learned.  Here, the wedge at d9 is right - w either gets out or captures the two stones on the bottom.  Actually, because of the accumulated strength here, w c8 should probablyhave been at d8 which would give w a good wall and build w's outside territory while reducing B.  As things turn out, B gets the side and reduces W territorial chances.]
;B[cm];W[dk];B[el];W[ek];B[ck];W[jf]C[Desperate - too deep.]
;B[ig]C[Possibly too ambitious.  M14 seems to be enought to win.  Take the side, chase white out - don't let w make eyes - and take territory.  you could chase white and make lots of points here.  this 65 says you plan to kill white.  not gonna happen.]
;W[jg];B[fk]C[too small -can't ignore the white invasion - this makes a mockery of 65]
;W[if];B[ej]C[this makes for three unanswered moves - no wonder w lives.]

;W[me];B[kh];W[lg];B[lh];W[mh]C[The turtle shape on the left is not sufficient compensation for the devastating invasion by w.  This was much too easy for w to live.  Read Kato's attack and kill or some other book about handling deep invasions.]

C[This is very small - B2 or B3 are much larger.  So is D16 or D17 or a number of other attacks against the w shimari - B is now so strong around it that many things work well.]
;W[bq];B[bo];W[bg]C[Too late to attack the corner.  Any move to the top by B would have been larger than defending at B5.  Count the points - it is really quite small.]

;B[dn];W[eo]C[Very small endgame moves these last few - look at the b center and the upper left - lots of points yet - w can start by threatening to pull the stones out F16, followed by w f17 is worth more.]
