;B[dp]C[I am a 26k. This game was against a 21kyu with no handicap.  I am black.
I think my major problem was i have trouble penetrating the opponent's
defensive line. This ends up leaving me with little territory.
I need some advice as to how i can avoid this from happening


I have made comments in the game I hope they are of some help.
It looks to me like Black gets into difficulties because of the
beginning of the game. It is better if black plays on the 3rd
or 4th line in the beginning of the game and then builds a large
framework. Black will not get all the territory he creates with
the framework but when white invades then he can attacke white
and build territory while doing so. It sounds easy doesn't it!!!

Enjoy your go playing life

is useful to think of a stone as either maintaining a connection
