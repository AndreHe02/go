C[(DaiTatakai) I dont know where I went wrong, or how could I have won the game.
Sorry for not making much questions/comments, I wasn't sure where to play many times.  If someone reviews this I am grateful, thanks.

forfun (ff) - This was an interesting game.  It had a number of twists and turns along the way.  I thought that it would not take too much for Black to improve significantly.  In the early going Black several times needed to appreciate better what White could aim at on the board.  Of course this is one of the hardest tasks that every Go player faces regardless of what level they play at :-)  In this game White had to find a way to utilize a very strong position in the lower left to make something happen in the center: either a big territory or a big fight.  If Black had better understood the limits of what White could try to achieve, it would have been easier to develop a strategy to develop Black's potential while countering White's chances.  I have tried to point out some chances to do that.  Later, in the middle-game fighting, Black missed a couple of chances to turn things around.  In particular late in the game, Black found a very nice tesuji to exploit a major weakness in White's position but did not find the right timing to use it.  The end result was a tough loss in a game that could have gone either way several times.]
;B[pd];W[do];B[pp];W[dd];B[dq]C[ff - This is natural but Black needs to keep in mind that there is a good chance that white will seal Black into the corner.  This is rather inconsistent with the two star points on the right side so Black needs to be watchful about making his strategy consistent.]
;W[fp]
(;B[co]C[ff - See the variation.];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn]
(;B[fq]C[ff - See the variation for an alternative from professional play.]

(;W[gp]C[ff - Usual is G3, see the variation.  However, there is nothing wrong with this play.  The G4 stone is very strong and radiates thickness across the board.  Black should regret this exchange when the two stones on the right side are star points.  They need to make use of their outside influence but this becomes more difficult now.  Nevertheless Black's overall position is not bad here and he has sente.]

(;B[fc]C[Fuseki is extremenily hard for me, I dont often know where to play. People say I should make my stones work together, but I dont know how. I also considered playing at Q10.

ff - Fuseki is extremely hard for everybody.  However, not everyone realizes it :-)  I think this is a completely natural choice and good.  See the variations for other ideas.]
;W[df]C[ff - A natural choice for White.  The alternative would be to pincer at J16 or H16.  The result would probably be a tense fight as Black allowed himself to be driven down the board to erase White's thickness while looking for the opportunity to turn back on the pincer stone(s) or erase White's left side potential territory.]
;B[jd]C[ff - This leaves behind the invasion point of H17.  In this case I think that it would be better at J16 instead.  Naturally J16 leaves a bigger gap at the top right for White to play into.  However, in this game if Black can prevent White from properly utilizing the bottom thickness, he will be in a good position strategically.]
;W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[ff - This is clearly a mistake in direction.  Black has not grasped the meaning of G4.  There is no way that the bottom will be more interesting than the top for Black.  See the variation.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[oj];B[ol]C[ff - Considering the state of the board, I think this is a good, calm answer to White's P10.  A huge question in this position is whether Black can get away with a play at C12.  This is the natural weak point of White's upper left.  However, the bottom left is so strong that Black will face a difficult fight.  Black needs to avoid having too many weaknesses across the board before invading.  This play strengthens the bottom and moves out into the center while keeping pressure on the White group above.]
;W[di]C[ff - This play is too conservative.  White has to expect to get more than fourth-line territory along the left side for the thickness at the bottom.]
;B[re];W[rf]C[Didn't know where to play..]
(;B[db]C[ff - Probably P3 is the largest point.  However, the other big question is what to do about the balance of power in the center.  Black has two common invasion points at the top: M17 and H17.  Until now if White invaded at H17, Black can answer by jumping in to the C17 point.  The slide is a heavy play in this position since Black can no longer settle himself lightly if White answers at C17.]
;W[ld]C[I wasn't sure how to answer here.. so I played based on intuation (like I usually do)

ff - In this case intuition lied to you :-)  The basic intuition in this position is that the White invader is weak (in other words, surrounded by Black stones).  In addition, the White stones on the right side can still be threatened.  The critical point of play is the upper side, not the upper left corner.  See the variation.]

(;B[cc]C[ff - See the variation.  This is not urgent.];W[lf]

(;B[qe]C[ff - This play may secure the corner but it essentially forces White to connect the top-side invaders to the right-side group, making them all stronger.  Black should be dissatisfied with this result.]
;W[of];B[oq]C[ff - A very big play but again it is not the right time for this.  Black needs to close the weakness in the top left.]
;W[hc]
(;B[nf]C[ff - This is not reasonable after White has played H17.  Black can not easily threaten the White stones on the left so it is difficult to start something here.]
;W[mc]
(;B[oe]C[ff - This is not a good idea.  Black is thinking in a purely defensive way.  Instead Black needs to assess that White's threats in the corner are not more severe than Black's threats on the right side.  See the variation.]
;W[fd]C[ff - Now Black faces a serious problem as White threatens to make a large territory in the center.]

;W[ck];B[cl];W[cm];B[dl];W[bj]C[I got scared here, I was afraid of white N3, so I played O3 and let white decide what happens.

ff - There are two cases:
1. You could read out that N3 would lead to the capture of Black's stones.  Then you really have no choice except to play on the bottom side.
2. You were not sure what would happen and backed down.  This is a kind of bad "move".  The joy of going through with B7 alone is enough that I think Black should "want" to take the chance :-)]

(;B[nq];W[bn]C[ff - Compare this situation to the variation.]
;B[rr]C[ff - I guess the question is whether or not Black assessed that the game was close at this point.  If so, then the judgement about playing O3 instead of B7 can not be faulted.  Only Black knows the answer to that :-)

(;B[bm];W[ak];B[bn]C[ff - Black captures the lower left corner.  At a guess this is worth about 35 points before we sort out what happens around N3.  On the other hand, Black captured the lower right corner in the game for about twenty points.  This can not happen if Black ends up in a capturing race after White N3.]
;W[mq];B[mr]C[ff - N3 by itself is not sente.  If White plays O3, Black captures with M3.  So White will not be able to play down at N2.  However, this has the minus of pushing White to the left, making a connection to the dead White stones on the left side a bigger threat.]

(;W[kq]C[ff - White has lots of choices here.  The fight looks close.  I do not know who wins and do not intend to try to analyze it to the end.  The objective result does not really matter if we are not strong enough to read it all out over the board.]

Note that this is a dual purpose play that both threatens to erase White's center and to greatly expand Black's bottom right.  Black's top is larger than White's left side (C17 is still open and the lower left is limited already.  So the question is whether the center is worth more than the lower right corner and the lower left corner.  The issue is not completely decided but Black should be happier than White :-)]
