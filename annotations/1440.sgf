C[You have two main problems in this game:

1) You're getting into fights against a much stronger opponent. The best cure for this is to get stronger :-).

2) You're getting into fights against much stronger groups. You need to think more about which fights are worthwhile, and be more willing to give up stones, at least temporarily.]
;B[qd];W[od];B[mc];W[qc];B[pd]LB[pc:a][rc:b]C[The joseki moves here are 'a' (Q17) and 'b' (S17). Your move leads to your stones becoming short of liberties when White answers at 'a'.]
;W[pc];B[pg]LB[oc:a][pf:b]C[If you want to defend your two stones you need to play closer to them, at 'b' (Q14). The other alternative is to play the cut at 'a' (P17), which gets complicated.]
;W[rd];B[oe];W[oc];B[re];W[ne];B[rc];W[of];B[pf];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[rb];B[sd];W[kc];B[ld]LB[ec:a][ic:b][cd:c]C[This is heavy. The White group to the right is strong and the Whtie stone at L17 can extend along the top edge to make a base, so you're creating a weak Black group between two strong White ones. It's unlikely that you'll be able to attack either White group, so all you're doing here is destroying a few points of potential White territory and creating a burden for yourself. Instead, I would play something like 'a' (E17), leaving either 'b' (J17) or 'c' (C16) to follow.]
;W[kd];B[le];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb]
(;B[ke]LB[nc:a]C[You need to connect at 'a' (O17) if your group is to serve any purpose. If you connect then White will need a move to stabilise the L17 group, and by forcing you to play O18 and O17 he has weakened his other group, making the fight a bit more even.]
;W[nc]C[Now all the White stones are safe.];B[hc]LB[id:a]C[... which makes this move dangerous, as a White move at 'a' (J16) attacks both H17 and the weak Black group at the same time. I would just abandon the four Black stones around M16 for the moment, as they serve no real purpose, and just take one of the corners instead.]
;W[fc];B[he];W[fe];B[jb];W[id];B[ie];W[ic];B[ed];W[hd];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[cd];W[ge];B[hh]C[You're still adding stones to a group that has no purpose, just take a big point instead. White can't capture your stones in one move, and it's not worth him spending more than one move to capture them unless he can do so on a large scale.]
;W[fh];B[dg];W[ci];B[ch]LB[ec:a][cf:b]C[This provokes White into strengthening his stone and still leaves you with a weakness at 'b' (C14). If you're worried about the corner group, 'a' (E17) would leave it secure and is big in terms of territory.]
;W[di];B[bh];W[hj];B[ji];W[de]
(;B[ee]LB[dd:a]C[Connecting at 'a' (D16) looks much safer.]
;W[dd]LB[ec:a]
(;B[dc]LB[ec:a]C['a' (E17) might be possible, but it's not really clear - see the variation on the previous move.]

;W[eb];B[df]C[White couldn't have played here, so there's no point you playing here.]
;W[dc];B[qk];W[qm];B[ok]C[Good. Not only does this defend the side, it gives your weak stones in the centre something to connect to as well.]
;W[om];B[qo]LB[pq:a]C[A bit too aggressive. Playing 'a' (Q3) would leave you with options of enclosing the corner or extending along the side, and the White stones would look badly placed because they'd have nothing to attack and not much room to make territory.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[qj];W[qq];B[pn];W[pm];B[oq];W[ro]
(;B[qp]LB[rp:a]C['a' (S4) looks like it separates the two White groups - see the variations on the previous move.]
;W[rp];B[pq];W[qr];B[nn]LB[kq:a]C[Better to play something like 'a' (L3) to give yourself a base. Your move looks like it's trying to attack the White group, but that isn't possible any more.]

(;B[np]LB[nq:a]C['a' (O3) appears to capture the White stones - see the variation on the previous move.]
;W[lr];B[nq];W[js];B[jn]LB[kn:a]C[This leaves behind a cutting point at 'a' (L6). That might be OK if you were attacking the White group, but it's too strong to attack now.

Playing in the bottom left corner would be very big.];W[jk]

(;B[mj]C[I don't think that you need this move to keep your stones connected, though there are a lot of possible variations here so I'm not really sure. Even if you do need the move to save all your stones, taking the lower left corner looks bigger unless White can capture all of the centre stones, which seems unlikely.]
;W[cp];B[cl]LB[bj:a]C[Jumping to 'a' (C10) would be safe, but as you're behind I think your move is a better idea.]
;W[bi];B[co];W[jg]
(;B[lg]LB[bp:a]C[Living in the corner with 'a' (B4) looks bigger than rescueing these stones - see the variation on the previous move.]
;W[bo];B[dp];W[cq];B[do]C[The problem with this is that it makes White's next move obvious. I can't come up with any more promising moves though.]
