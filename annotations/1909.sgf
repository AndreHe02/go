;B[pq];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[ee];W[fe]C[Thank you for letting me review this game.. you made lots of mistakes, but you are learning with them and thats good.
First F15 in this situation is like begging black to separate your stones with E16. A good move would be D15 that would enclose the corner well. Other good moves include E16, try that in the next games.]
;B[ef];W[ed];B[ff];W[fd];B[gf];W[de];B[ge]C[What were the major flaws in the opening? i was in defensive right from the start, forced to save my pieces from atari and being captured.]
;W[gd]C[You got a great result there, normally getting 3rd line territory is even because black gets 4th line influence... but in this case you got 4th line territory which is very good, just count the amount of points that are possible yours there.]
;B[dj];W[jq];B[jd];W[hc];B[id];W[hd];B[he];W[ic]C[This move is not really necessary, and other moves like Q10, C13, B5 look bigger.]
;B[if];W[gp];B[gn];W[dn];B[em];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm]C[here you started a war where you were behind in number, black has 3 stones vs your 2 and the next turn he will have 4 stones. I would be very difficult to make something good out of it.]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[en];W[fo];B[hn];W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[fj]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[hl]C[Black got great shape here, and you got 3 hanging stones, neither close enough to a group to save... so dont even bother and play somewhere else.]
;W[eo];B[ej];W[fi];B[dk];W[do];B[gj];W[ei];B[eh];W[di];B[ci]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[dg]C[your opponent was kind enough to let you off the hook... :)]
;B[df];W[cf];B[fh];W[cg];B[gi];W[ce]C[If you are unsure of whatever linking is necessary imagine a black piece there and how you would react, in this case, a cut would never work so you could have played somewhere else.]
;B[cj];W[hp];B[go];W[bm];B[ik];W[kb];B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[jb]
;B[lb];W[lc];B[ld];W[mc];B[md];W[mb];B[nd];W[la];B[nc];W[lb]
C[Very bad move... you just took 1 point from yourself instead of making more points... Good alternative moves Q5, Q10, O4. If you still wanna finish that zone, O18 is better.]
;B[nb];W[na];B[oa];W[ma];B[ob];W[mp];B[np];W[no];B[oo];W[op]
;B[nq];W[po];B[on];W[pp];B[oq];W[pn];B[nn];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln]
;B[jn];W[nl];B[mk];W[mm]C[Very good capture, you just gained lots of leverage to fight in enemy zones.]
;B[om];W[pl];B[ml];W[nm];B[qp];W[ol];B[qn];W[pm];B[km];W[qo]
C[Good cut];B[qq];W[rn];B[ro];W[qm];B[rp];W[mr];B[nr];W[ms]
;B[ns];W[so]C[N3 is urgent. Black can easily cut you and. Besides there are very big points elsewhere like Q12.]
;B[sp];W[rr]C[I placed 128 there because I thought i could kill him off.. but I was wrong.. any suggestions on how to finish black?

There is no way you could have killed black, it is alive. Unless black dosent responds to your attacks.]
;B[qr];W[rs];B[qs];W[rq];B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[sq]C[Even if black didnt used your weakness at N3 he could easily capture with T2 and T1. The black group is too solid to kill.]
;B[mq];W[lq]C[You lost lots of points because of N3. Count them.]
;B[lr];W[ls];B[ks];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr];B[js];W[is];B[nk];W[oi]
;B[oj];W[nj]C[Another fight where you start in desavantage... dont do that.]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[mi];W[lj];B[kj];W[lk];B[ll];W[ok];B[pj];W[li]
;B[lh]C[i struggled to fight for the middle, what else could i have done to get some grounds in the middle? You were fighting a lost fight, in the end however you still got something out of it.]
;W[mh];B[nh];W[mg];B[ki];W[pi];B[kk];W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[nj]
;W[ng];B[lg];W[of]C[P12 is the key point. Its urgent. As they say "Play urgent moves before big ones". J2 is also urgent.]
;B[oh];W[og];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[qi];B[qg];W[rg];B[qf];W[pe]
;B[qe]C[Your stones are already dead.];W[oe];B[qd];W[lf];B[kf]

[ja][ka]C[for a while i thought i was winning because i've got all these areas (X). But at the endgame i somehow let him penetrate through and lost most of the grounds.]
;W[bh];B[ch];W[ah];B[bi];W[ho];B[ai];W[al];B[bg]C[not paying attention, its too late now and he got through.. my question is how to stop him further advancing?

Easy, make atari. B14 and A14 close it.];W[ag];B[af];W[ae];B[be]
;W[ad];B[bd];W[tt];B[bf];W[tt];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb]
;W[cb];B[ca];W[da];B[ba];W[db]C[At this point Black is already the winner, despite your best start.]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[kp];W[lp];B[ir];W[jp]C[making more mistakes not saving 146, black is gaining a lot of my 'secured' grounds.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[hs];W[gr];B[iq];W[gq];B[gs];W[is]C[F1 was the answer here.]
;B[fs];W[er];B[ir];W[iq];B[is];W[es];B[fr];W[fq];B[hj];W[eq]
;B[rh];W[ri]C[again failed to save my 2 pieces. i think i need to be more aware of atari of the pieces.]
;B[sh];W[si];B[dm];W[bl];B[bk];W[bn];B[ak];W[lm];B[kn];W[jo]
;B[in];B[fs]C[ You can easily get better if you pay more attention to those urgent spots, and create less fights in areas where you are outnumbered. Good Game. Hope my review helped you.]
