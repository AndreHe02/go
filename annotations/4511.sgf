;W[id]C[what is the best extension to D16? (he always can attack at F and G so i need to be flexible)

* I don't see a good way of extension. Your move seems a little slack. The two white stones are comfortably alive already and if B  invades the corner now, he probably  gaines enough for a comfortable lead.]

;W[lf];B[je]C[was it a bad exchane for white because my upper teritory can be stolen easily (maybe he can make teritory there)

* In the end it was a good exchange for W. But only because B didn't play moves which were severe enough to affect the stabitlity of your upper group and attacked the lower one at the same time. Playing double-purpose-moves is an important concept for becoming stronger. 
There is another rule:
"Attach or play near the the group the attacked group wants to connect with in order to get thickness there."]

;W[tt]C[Can you add some weaknesses of me?(In which knowledge of go iam behind my rank[7k\])

Iam looking forward to your e-mail :D

* First, if you were far behind in some knowlendge of a 7k, you wouldn't be a 7k, would you? ;-) I think you have a good sense of shape and severe (attack) moves already. In this game you dominated the midgame phase after a not-so-well fuseki, you split B in three small and one big group while you had one small and two big groups which shows that you played some strong midgame moves.

If you want to improve, think about the following words:

- In most cases attack isn't for definite killing but for gaining strong groups which can be used for invading or moyo-building later.

- Don't cut when you're not sure if you're cutting stones are at least of equal strenght as the enemy stones around or do have enogh place to flee. Against a stronger opponent your running group in the middle would have been in extreme danger and you'd probably had to abbadon some of the upper group stones to save the middle group. However, the attack on the upper left black group worked fine, you build a big upper moyo, also the group on the bottom right survived which granted you the victory.

Other things you may work on are:
1) Direction in fuseki. (learn to block from the right side)
2) If an enemy move hardly threatens any group or stone, think a while and when tenuki looks bigger, tenuki. 
3) Tsumego (life and dead problems) - you misread if a standard group could be killed in this game. 
At goproblems.com you can do nice problems in order to sharpen this skill - it helps a lot.

That's all I can remark. Greetings,
