C[Hi Daniel,

I reviewed your game and added my comments. I hope they are helpful for you. For what it's worth, I am around 3d on KGS, so many of my comments may not get close to the truth; rather take them as food for thought ...

;W[on];B[np]LB[mq:a]C[black gets out of usual joseki at a

ug: This is joseki as well.]
(;W[pl]C[it seems ok for white

ug: Yes, this is ok for white. White could also play at R3 (see the variations).]
;B[ql]C[ug: This is a bit heavy. R4 or R9 instead are better.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[qi];W[qq]C[now is it still ok?

ug: R3 looks like an overplay. I would be tempted to invade at R17 or Q17 instead, maybe after playing Q11 or P12.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pp]C[it seems i cannot play r4 now];W[qo];B[oo]
;W[no];B[op];W[pn];B[qp]
(;W[rp]C[maybe strange?

ug: I think white should maybe play N4 directly instead, which is quite severe. N5 is also possible and is a very thick move.]

(;B[rq];W[mp]C[i am trying to focus on strength towards center, but....looks strange
maybe r3 move was not ok after all

ug: Since black answered S4, white still gets N4 ... good!]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[ro]C[ug: Too small.]
;W[jq]C[ug: White can be satisfied with his position now. (That does not mean that white has a huge lead now, but I think he is ahead.)]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[hq]C[i feel ok, am i right?
if so, did black make a mistake

ug: White's position is good now, I think. Black's S3 and S5 were mistakes, I think. (Much earlier, R8 was probably not optimal.) Instead of H3, C10 or D10 also look interesting, or maybe still Q17/R17. H3 is of course very solid, but it looks a little like "just endgame".]
;B[rh]C[looks too cautious to me, am i right?

ug: There still is some bad aji here, but if black wants to play here, I would prefer S6. But right now, other moves seem more important.]
;W[qc]C[ok to invade now?

ug: Invading is ok. But maybe Q17 or P18 are better points, since now black is glad to black at Q17.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
(;W[rf]C[ok to play this?

ug: Since this is clearly gote, white should play elsewhere instead. Black can then play S14 himself, which white has to answer, but since S14 does not achieve very much for black, this is not a problem. The white move at S14 is close to being a wasted move.]
;B[ch];W[ck]C[reminds me of 4 stones josekis hasami];B[eh];W[ff]
;B[gd]C[i do not recognize this move, what to do?

ug: This is a standard move, which threatens E15.]
(;W[gh]C[ok?

ug: Looks a little thin.];B[bf];W[be];B[cf];W[ce];B[dg];W[ef]

(;B[dj]
(;W[eb]C[ok? or should attack other group?

ug: See the variation.];B[ec];W[dc]
(;B[fb]C[ug: Much too small. See the variation for a better way of playing.]
;W[gj]C[ug: I still think that D9 is very good for white. Now that the group in the top left corner is safe, G10 is the wrong direction, I think.]
;B[dk];W[cl]C[extension ok?

ug: I think I would prefer to play hane, but the extension is probably ok, too. However, note that it makes a big difference whether black or white gets D9!]
;B[cj];W[co];B[fk];W[hl];B[en]
(;W[fp]C[ug: This looks a little small. I would try to enclose the center, and to threaten to reduce black's top at the same time. In addition, there may still be bad aji in the corner even after F4. (See the variations.)]

(;B[gn];W[in];B[gk];W[hk];B[oi];W[mj]C[ug: This is too submissive. We see now that it would really have been important for white to be the first to play around here.]
;B[mi];W[lg]C[what about this move?

ug: Since black was able to play first in the center, white has a problem now. This move looks ok, but I think it would have been better to play it directly, instead of N10. Now the N10/N11 exchange does not look good for white.]
;B[nn];W[mo];B[nj]
(;W[nk];B[lj];W[mk];B[ki];W[jg]C[should i n12 first?

ug: No. What would N12 achieve?];B[hi]
(;W[ld]C[too agressive?

ug: It's good to ignore the peep (which was a bad move, since it does not pose a real threat). But M16 is too risky.]
;B[ke];W[ng];B[rg]
(;W[lf]C[ok?

ug: See the variation.];B[le];W[me];B[md];W[kl];B[gi]C[ug: Small.]

(;W[ji]C[i wanted so much to connect i accepted to lose territory
was i right? any previous mistake?

ug: Why do you want to connect two living groups? White loses a lot of points here. See the variation.]

;B[bj];W[aj];B[ai];W[ak];B[bh]C[not really necessary i believe?

ug: If black plays elsewhere, white can A12 and A14. But instead of B12, black should play A15 in sente, which also fixes the weakness.]
;W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[gb];W[sn]C[ok to play like this?

ug: Yes, because black still has a ko to cut off T9, otherwise.]

;B[ni]C[ug: Hmmm ...];W[qh]C[of course it helps a lot to win, but without this , i was not leading!

ug: Yes. The main reasons are that the white center is pretty small without capturing these stones (see comments on white F4), and that black got a lot at the top (mainly by cutting off M16).]
