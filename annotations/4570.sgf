AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, this is XCMeijin. I'll be glad to answer the questions you've put into this review application. Not just that, but I'll put in opinions and comments wherever I feel neccessary, OK?

First thing: Seeing as this is a handicap game, the principle behind victory for White (you) is to play a "bit" more aggressively. I say a "bit" because there's only 2 handicap stones in this game, but when you encounter more, you'll see white fighting even more aggressively.

Right, let's go through the game!]
(;W[dd]C[XCM: Good. Seeing as black's 2 stones ate on the 4th line, you should put a star-point stone up to counter any influence.

Most people think the first move doens't mean much. I'm here to tell you that it means LOADS.

In my opinion, because of my above comments, 4-4 is ideal. I reckon it fares better than the 3-4 (the next most common opening move) because 3-4 is on the 3rd line, plus it has the obvious weakness of the keima assault to deal with.

See variation to see what I mean...];B[pq];W[po]C[XCM: Good, attack the unbalanced corner.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[np]
(;W[pk];B[om];W[nn]C[kluther [9k\]: Probably should not have fought, probably r7 or s7 better?

XCM: Definitely NOT S7, that's way too low. If you really want to go on the defensive, R7 might be best.

However, like I said, in a handi game, white must be more aggresive. In that sense, I can see the motivation behind O6.

I think your problems started when you put Q9 on the 4th line. Bases/extensions are usually on 3rd line, remember? (SEE comments at move 6)]
;B[qn]
(;W[ro]C[XCM: You've got the wrong idea here, i think. There's no way you can confine black, too many holes. Rather, try to press black down and maybe create some thickness.

See variation...];B[ql];W[qk];B[nm];W[no];B[mp];W[ln];B[nk]
;W[pm]C[kluther [9k\]: probably q12 better?

XCM: The outcome seems to be similar, but again, i'd aim for the 3rd line extension at R13, perhaps. Also, this acts as a large keima assault against the Q16 stone.

GO TO move 25 to see my point.];B[pn];W[pl];B[on];W[oo];B[qm]

(;W[ni]C[XCM: SEE variation...];B[ll]C[XCM: Your tactics to surround and kill black here are NOT working. You must approach more indirectly. Keep that in mind.]
;W[ok];B[qj];W[rk];B[qh]
(;W[sm]C[XCM: ALERT! Just so you know, the correct tesuji to connect here is T8 or T6, the diagonal.

See variations at move 30-31...]

;B[qq];W[rr];B[qr];W[qs];B[ps];W[rs];B[or];W[op]C[kluther [9k\]: slack move, should be c10?

XCM: Yes, your white group is very much alive now, better to take out some big points.]
;B[nq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[oq];B[mr];W[jc]C[kluther [9k\]: again c10 was better

XCM: perhaps D10, even. Remember what i said about the 4th line?]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[jm];W[cj]C[XCM: Well, doesn't matter, you still got it :P]
;B[cm]
(;W[pb]C[kluther [9k\]: not good, should be n17?

XCM: Could go even further, O17 even. That's the usual assault pattern, right?

Q18 is only giving black the chance to create thickness.

(;W[bh]C[XCM: Should probably atack from above, something like E14.

See variation...];B[ef]C[XCM: Oh noes... not black has run out to the centre... YOUR centre.]
;W[fd];B[dh];W[bf];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[gc];B[gf];W[je]C[XCM: Weak. Considering you have 2 points of contact (K17 and M10) you can afford to go even further. L13 or thereabouts looks like a good move.]

1/ Don't be greedy
2/ Don't play unneccessary moves

Other than that, work on your opening theory a bit. Your other principles seem to be at a good level.

Good luck in your Go!
