C[Greetings.
I notice that you've not added any of your own comments of your own so I'm going to do a general review on everything. Do note that I'm only a 10k so take my comments with a grain of salt.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp]
(;W[nq]C[A bit unusual for white to start attacking and ignoring the upper left corner here but still playable.]
;B[np];W[oq];B[pq];W[op]
(;B[oo]C[This move leaves black a bit thin with 2 cutting points whereas white has a solid shape. It would be better for black to make a solid connection and gain territory on the right instead. (See variation)]

(;W[mp]C[White decides to aim for the side instead of the corner. There is another way white could move. (See variation)]
;B[no];W[lp];B[qj]LB[qn:A]C[note that black is still open to invasion at R6]

(;W[nc]C[white should have gotten the upper left corner here instead of attacking so soon.]

(;B[nd]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[Actually, black also could have ignored this move as it does not threaten any stones and get the upper left corner instead.

However, if black really wants to respond to that move, perhaps Q14 or R14 would be better as it would secure a large piece of the right side.]
;W[oc]C[Pretend I'm saying it over and over again for both white and black.

Play at the upper left.];B[pc];W[od]
(;B[oe]C[The same mistake is being made here. Black should connect instead of trying to contain.]

(;W[md]LB[ne:A]C[In this case, I think it would be better if white splits the black group with O15 and get the corner as there is no friendly stone at the top.]
;B[ne];W[kd];B[qg]C[Nice move here. Gets territory and protects the cut at Q15 at the same time.]
;W[pb]C[This is a very small move. There are larger moves at this stage of the game. Upper left for instance.]
;B[qb];W[pa];B[qa];W[nb];B[qc];W[do]C[Another slow move here. However, white is gaining an incredible moyo at the center. Black should do something about it by either playing at the upper left and extending to the center from there or play at the center point (K10) now and connect it to the right or make 2 eyes.]
;B[cd]C[Finally the upper left. However, in this case, I would prefer the 4-4 point to ease the extension to the center. The 3-4 point facilitates gaining territory on the side.]
;W[de]
(;B[ec]C[Try extending the other way first.];W[ce];B[dd];W[fd]
C[White shuts black in nicely.];B[fc];W[gc];B[ed];W[ee];B[gd]
;W[fe];B[hc];W[ic];B[hd];W[id];B[hb]LB[cj:A][dj:D][ck:B][dk:C]
C[Small move here. Black should play elsewhere. (eg C9, C10, D9, D10)]
;W[ib];B[dj]C[Good move. Reducing white at the side as well as potential to expand to the center.]

(;W[ch]C[Actually, white could attack from the other side and push black into the wall but white must be careful not to get crushed as well.]
;B[cl];W[cj];B[fj];W[fl];B[fk];W[el]
(;B[dl]C[I'm not sure what black's intentions are over here but if black wants to make eyes, I would advise connecting to a living group at this stage of play.]

;W[cq];B[em];W[fn];B[di];W[fi];B[ci];W[dh]
(;B[bi]C[Actually, this move is not important. Black should play in the center quickly.]

(;B[eo]C[This stone was a mistake. It should have been placed at H6 to create an eye.]
;W[fo]C[H6 now is still playable although you lose 5 stones]

(;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fr];B[fq];W[es]
(;B[gr]C[These are all small points. Black should play elsewhere. eg H14 for attack or H6 to defend. Actually, defending at H6 is more important.]
;W[hn]
(;B[ho];W[in];B[jm]C[It's no use placing stones like that. It only helps white strengthen its territory.]

[on][pn][rn][sn][po][qo][so][gp][qp][rp][hr][is]C[This is the end of my review. Basically, the endgame moves have nothing special to comment about except that the N5 point could be filled for an extra point. Both players played well. It is not that easy to take so much territory at the center. The major mistake by black was to allow the L7 group to be taken, else, black would have won. White's tendency to go for the center first is unusual for a 25k but still workable. Most importantly, this review is done by a 10k so do not think that my comments or variations of moves are the best option available.

Thank you.])
