C[Hi i'm 19k on kgs, thanx for reviewing my game, and make lots of commens!lol...and pls comment ne moves i have done wrong..and better variations..thank u]
;B[pd]C[My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I will be reviewing your game.

I think you won this game largely as a result of your opponent's passive play.  All of us amateurs make mistakes, but in this case, your opponent never punished your mistakes!

In future, I think you might also be better off sending in a game that you *lost*.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qj];W[jp];B[cf]C[Ted: It might be better to approach from the other direction, at F17, since F17 would also serve as an extension from the Q16 stone.]
;W[ci];B[cc]C[Was this a good time to enter the 3-3?

Ted: the 3-3 move is a perfectly good move in this situation.  Indeed, it's a standard joseki against the pincer attack]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[Ted: The more common move here is to play at D17.  Black ends up with territory in the corner, and uses the C14 stone as aji -- Black is willing to sacrifice it, but uses threats to connect it to the corner as a way to gain more territory someplace else]
;W[be];B[bb];W[ce];B[cm]C[Ted: I really think you ought to play another move on the top.  White doesn't need to respond here right away, and can use the extra move to play at D17 now, which would confine Black to a very small life in the corner while giving a good deal of influence to White.

See the variation.]
(;W[ck];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq]C[Ted: I think White would have been much better off playing D5 here.  It's OK to let one's opponent get a small amount of territory if you can play moves that allow you to get more territory, although this is easier said than done.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[bl];W[df];B[np];W[nc];B[qf];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld]
;B[mc];W[md];B[nb];W[kc];B[oc];W[nd];B[fc];W[hc];B[dc]C[Ted: You were extremely lucky that White allowed you to get this point.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[pm]C[Ted: So far, White has played rather passively and allowed you to get quite a bit of territory on the right -- more than White has anywhere else on the board.]
;W[lq];B[gp]C[Should i have went on the fourth or third line?i went on the fourth thinking it was easier to escape because i had stones on the side should the situation arise..tell me wat u think..

Ted: Playing on the fourth line is fine here.  In fact, I don't think you really need to worry about escaping -- play moves that are designed to reduce the amount of territory White can get (like this move splitting White into two groups, and while White is worrying about looking after his own groups, your stones should almost be able to look after themselves.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[iq];B[do]C[Ted: Look at the difference between this position and if White had been allowed to play here earlier but let you get B3.]

(;B[en]C[Ted: I'm pretty certain that you don't need to play here to connect.  Better would be to cut into White's territory with something like L12, or to prevent White from attempting to play R12 (which, if White can connect, would cost you a good deal of territory) by playing at P12.]
;W[kh];B[ik];W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[lk];W[nr];B[io]C[Ted:  Play something bigger.  P12 is still out there, while Q2 is simple and gets the whole corner for you.]

;W[ki];B[lj];W[ji];B[jl]C[maybe i should've connected at J10 instead of going after the two stones?

;W[qn];B[po];W[rl];B[qm]C[Was this move necessary?

Ted: I think you could have waited one more move before playing here.  But in a position like this, I'd play a safe move like this instead of passing anyhow.  You're far enough ahead that playing one extra stone isn't going to make a difference, and playing this stone gives you peace of mind.]
