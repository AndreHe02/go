AB[pd][dp]C[io(11kyu at the moment): I'll do this review for Peter, who's playing the black stones. Enjoy.]
;W[pp];B[dc]C[<>PR  staking a presence in the remaining corner

io: Exactly the right thing to do now.];W[fq];B[dn];W[kq];B[qj]
;W[rm];B[qg];W[mc];B[kc]C[<>PR  trying a pincer, my thought here were to follow up by L15 and then N14 if allowed

io: Both sides played very well until now. Next move at L15 is a good idea. N14 afterwards is ok, but i'd rather think about securing the upper right corner (or at least half of it). Leaving some territory at the edge, maybe even a (small) corner to white in change for some influence is not bad in this stage of the game - but can you turn the influence into territory in the end?]
;W[me];B[ke];W[mg]C[io: This is just what you would expect from white.]
;B[ce]C[<>PR Decided not to pursue into centre but aim to secure a corner

io: Good idea. The correct order in the opening is to play in empty corners first, then play in "unbalanced" corners (the only unbalanced corner here was D17), last play at the sides.]
;W[dl];B[dj]LB[di:X]TR[df][dg][dh]SQ[ce][de]C[io: This move should be OK! You might even think about giving some way playing at D11 instead.

How can you dicide how far away from your own stones you should play?
A good rule of thump to determine the "correct" distance is: if one, jump two - if two, jump three - and so on.
This usually is if there are no other stones arround. Playing closer is more secure (for example if your opponent already has some stones in place) further away your stones can usually be seperated.

Here you can assume that you have a wall of two stones on C15/D15 (squares) by shifting the D17-stone in your mind. So you can jump three (triangle) from your stones and play on D11 (X).]
;W[bk]C[<>PR expected him to play F8 as stated in my 'In the Beginning book'

io: This white move is strange... White would be lucky to live here so he'll have to escape into the center anyway.]
;B[cj]LB[bj:A][fn:B]C[<>PR  so thought about a wall creation to help protect D16 area. Bit worried here that he might now play F6, isolating a group

io: for F6 see var.]
(;W[bj]LB[ck:A][fl:B]
(;B[ck]TR[cj][dj]C[<>PR  unsure what to do here ...perhaps F8 would have been better.. see my variation

io: Almost everything would have been better than an empty triangle, which is bad shape. What about C7 or D7? P17 or D3 are big moves, too. H16 to secure your territory at the top or, if you like, attack white in the lower right region?]
;W[cl];B[ch]C[<>PR Conscious of being heavy so extended

io: ...if two, jump... one?!? No! Your stones are totally overconcentrated now.]
;W[bn]C[io: White needs a base!];B[fm]C[<>PR  and now looking to build a route for D6 group.. realized that no chance of isolating/capturing C8 group

io: You don't neccessarily have to kill your opponents groups. Instead you often get more profit, if you keep him buisy making life while setteling your own territory, for example with B6 or B7 in move 20 or 22. Now that white has a base, he doesn't fear to be sealed in...]
;W[cq]C[io: ...instead he calmly takes the corner.
This move, by the way, is "light". The C3-stone is connected either to F3 or to B6. White can leave the decision to you and he will win in any case.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[fk]C[<>PR  a sort of outer wall to compensate his inner corner. In this position was beginning to wish i had played L13 earlier

io: What does this move do? It cuts off the white escape route to the center, which white doesn't need any more! White does not only have secure live, but gets a nice big corner-territory, too. It does _not_ secure or enlarge black's territory in the top board region.
It probably ensures a connection for the black D6-group. That doesn't seem most urgent. Your stones would get a connection to a living group almost certainly. White is in almost the same situation with his N15-group and doesn't seem worried so far.]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ci]LB[bi:B][di:A]
(;B[di];W[bi];B[dg];W[fl];B[el]C[<>PR  i played this because i thought it separated his stones..but was it playing into danger as playing a stone which would only have 2 liberties and normally i try and search board for this situation with aim of  attacking/defending it

io: If you want to keep the connection between F9 and F7 this is your move, but maybe it's not the best plan here.]
;W[gl];B[em];W[gk];B[fj];W[gg];B[gd]C[io: You could have had a stone here for ages.]
;W[kg];B[hi]C[<>PR  thinking of looking for opportunities to isolate groups]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[hj]LB[gh:A][fi:B][ii:D][ij:C][hk:E]
(;B[gh]C[<>PR  I had a number of thoughts here F11, J10, J11, H9. To seek atari or to extend (H10 ) into centre. And, H11 only has 2 liberties. I do not think i played this next passage well

io: let's see... (vars.)
So, of your alternatives J10 seems to be the best one, but... you already spent about 15 stones for about 35 points of territory in the upper-left region. And the ratio will even get worse, if you put any more stones in.]
;W[fi]LB[eh:A][fh:B]
(;B[eh]LB[fh:B][hh:A]C[<>PR  Looking to isolate F11 group]
(;W[hh]C[<>PR  but!  did not consider this..notice i am also now losing time ground]
;B[hk];W[ij];B[hm]C[<>PR  using a lot of time here. Again isolating the G8 group but the whole scene seemed complicated and i recognized that H9 only had 2 liberties..feeling under pressure here]
;W[hl]C[io: And that's why the geta doesn't work here.];B[ii]
C[<>PR  which one of the many threats to combat];W[ih];B[ji]
;W[jj]LB[fh:A][iq:B]
(;B[fh]C[<>PR  trying to relieve some of the pressure by removing F11

io: If you had played F12 instead of E12 you could now just remove the F11-stones.
But anyway, the last... 12 moves at least did no good for black. 
I understand that you felt under pressure because your time was elapsing. Even so, it would probably have saved time, if you leaned back once in a while, to look at the _whole_ board. There still is a big move at P17 for example. The corner in the lower right is still open, and after you put in lots of stones at the D-row and in line 7, you could aswell use the influence to put some force on the white F3-stone.]
;W[ki];B[ei]C[<>PR  FORCED.. so i had to capture here!

io: indeed];W[id]LB[ic:B][ie:A]C[<>PR  A surprise..my mind was still in H10 mode

io: :)]
(;B[ie]C[<>PR  Under ( J17 ) or over (J15). I chose J15 because of ' isolate group ' theme  but J17 may have made connection between L17 and G16]
;W[jd];B[ic]C[<>PR  boxing him in but i did not realize dangers ahead]
;W[kd];B[ld]LB[jc:B][je:A]C[io: I'd prefere the sure connection at K17. If white decided to play the next move here instead of K15 you'd get into even more trouble.]

(;W[je]C[<>PR and now cutting points for W to exploit are appearing everywhere]
;B[jf];W[le];B[kf];W[lc]C[<>PR  and the boxing of K16 group has failed]
;B[ik]C[<>PR so shifted focus to my other problem area];W[il]
;B[jk];W[kj]LB[jl:A][kl:B]
(;B[jl];W[im];B[in]TR[gm]C[<>PR  G7 may have been better here instead of chasing a white G* capture dream

io: Even if you had an extra stone at G7 the ladder doesn't work for black! Reading ladders properly is very important and it's not really a hard thing to do. With a little practice you can read any ladder, all across the board if neccesary, in no time.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kl]C[<>PR  just did not look ahead enough..also now 6 minutes down]
;B[kk];W[lk]LB[jc:B][nd:A]C[<>PR  just a stupid mistake. L9 was a complete blind spot.]

(;B[nd]LB[jc:B][nc:C][md:A]C[io: The order of moves is of some interest. (see var. on move 86)]

(;W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb]LB[oa:B][nb:A]
(;W[nb];B[pa];W[ob];B[pl]C[<>PR  W is well in front now.. i was looking here to just occupy space and hence try and prevent W from a O6 moyo

io: There usually is no territory in the center. Instead you force white to turn his insecure framework into territory.
The "good" spots are about the same, you already had in move 60.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[hd];W[ld];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm]C[io: *This* is what you wanted? You could still try to live in the lower right corner, but with the white wall you just built it's become almost impossible.]

;W[jn];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[hp];B[gp];W[hq]LB[fp:A][gq:B]
(;B[fp]C[<>PR  considered G3 here but as my previous attempts at group separation had been futile, now was taking a more conservative approach..but as i am losing perhaps wrong thing to do

io: Definitly the wrong time to get scared. White's position is very cutty. :)]

;W[qm];B[rk];W[jh];B[gi];W[if];B[hf]C[<>PR  Mistake.. am way down on time and missed J15 being in atari

io: Don't worry too much, that's only one stone.];W[he];B[ge]
;W[gf];B[ie];W[ig];B[he];W[ff];B[hg]C[<>PR  looking to see again if i could isolate something... G14 group

io: In this case your attempt is working (but for what price). Often you can make more profit if you let your opponent live on a small scale while staking out a nice framework of your own, instead of fighting hard to kill.
As you try to separate and kill your opponents group, he is forced to fight back! Expecially in handicap games black doesn't want to end up in all-or-nothing fights as white wins too often.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[fd];B[fc];W[fe];B[de];W[kb]LB[hb:B][jb:A]
(;B[jb];W[ja];B[ia];W[hc]C[<>PR this came as a shock.. i had thought that K18 was safe and could be easily connected..i was wrong

io: Only experience will help to avoid such situations... and the practice of reading out more and more complicated positions calmly to the end.
How often did you play a ladder (that didn't work) to the end before you learned that it's better to stop early? See? :-)]
;B[gc];W[ib]LB[hb:B][ef:A]

[ip:B][ss:A]
(;B[ss]C[io: This move was wasted. Your group was alive already. And it's time for endgame now, so what possibilities do you have? (see vars.)

Variation B is the biggest and should therefore be played first.  I count a value of 9 Points (more or less ;) Even if an endgame sequence was gote it should be played if it was more then twice the value of the biggest remaining sente endgame.

Variation C is next. As you don't have any sente endgames you play the biggest one that would be sente for white.

Then white will probably play his remaining sente endgame (var. E)]
