RE[W+8.50]

C[Hello!  Thanks for reviewing my game. I was playing black. I would especially appreciate comments on the fuseki, but also on anything else you might think to comment on as well.  I've put a few questions/comments throughout the game record. Thanks again!

Ilya: Hello, I've tried to spot most serious mistakes in the game and offer my variations. But I'm just 6k* on IGS and while I'm several stones stronger then you I'm perhaps wrong in some cases and perhaps I didn't spot some important moments of the game. So I suggest you to treat my comments as ideas to think about, as ideas which you can try to apply in your games if you find them reasonable. I hope you find this review useful. Feel free to email me with further questions about this game at ilya@martynov.org

Ilya Martynov];B[pd];W[cp];B[ce];W[pp];B[eq];W[eo]C[Ilya: This white move is a hamete (trick move) according to Kogo's joseki dictionary.]

(;B[gp]C[Ilya: Last move by black is mistake. See variation which shows how white could punish this move. See variations on the previous move for correct response.]

(;W[dc]
(;B[bc]C[Ilya: Last black move is bad. Usually move on second line is being played to settle stones quickly. Here it is too pasive. You were first to play in this area so you have advantage here. See variation on this move for some ideas.]
;W[gc];B[ci];W[cl];B[nq];W[pq];B[kp];W[pj];B[jc];W[ge];B[jf]
LB[je:A]C[Ilya: Probably too far. I'd play at A. Black is not very strong in this area to afford double space jump.]
;W[qg];B[qe]SQ[pp][pq]TR[pj][qg]LB[cq:A][qm:B]C[Ilya: I don't like this move - it seems too passive to me. It doesn't really threats white. I'd consider myself points A and B. A takes under control over the corner. B starts splitting attack on the marked stones.]
;W[pm]SQ[pj][pp][pq][qg]TR[qe]C[Ilya: Now as you see white consolidated all its stones on the left side. It is perhaps still possible to invade this formation but it is much harder then a move ago. The last black move allowed this.]

(;B[md]LB[og:A][qh:B]C[Ilya: If I were building moyo I'd consider playing at A threating further play at B. See variation. The actual game move seems too passive.]
;W[ee];B[ng]TR[md]C[Ilya: Now the previous black move feels wasted.]
;W[cg];B[bg]TR[ee]LB[ng:A]C[I realize this was bad.  What would a better response be?

Ilya: I tried several variations but I could not find any better move. You'd better answer marked stone instead of playing at A on the previous move. But white didn't play good foollow-up here. See variation on the next move for good line of play for white.]

(;W[dg]C[Ilya: This is very wrong for white. It gives black a chance to fix all problems on the left side.]
;B[hg]LB[bf:A]C[Ilya: .. but you missed it. Move at A is a MUST.]
;W[bf];B[be];W[bh];B[cf];W[ag]TR[hg]C[Ilya: You missed your chance unfortunately. The lesson - always play urgent moves first. The marked stone is NOT urgent move.]
;B[cb];W[db];B[cc];W[eh];B[ej];W[el];B[gi]LB[gj:A]C[Ilya: Keima usually is bad for running as it gives your opponent cutting points. For example your opponent could use this weakness to get big territory on the left (see variation on the next move).]

(;W[ei];B[fj];W[dj];B[jj]LB[cq:C][or:B][rf:A]C[Ilya: Marked points are much bigger. In fact all of them will the biggest moves for both sides for several next moves.]
;W[mi]LB[cq:C][or:B][rf:A]C[All throughout this middlegame stage I felt as though it was hard for me to get sente -- I would try to make sente plays that turned out not to really be sente, or I would lose it again in only a few moves.  Do you have any suggestions as to how I could have kept the initiative?

Ilya: You were trying to enclose small center territory. None of moves you played to enclose the center were threating anything to white and thus they were not sente. Don't understimate moves on the side like I marked. They give you territiory and they are sente - if white doesn't answer them you can ruin a lot of his potential territory.]
;B[lh];W[ml];B[gl];W[mo];B[mp];W[no];B[fn];W[kn]C[Ilya: Both sides worry too much about the center :)]
;B[ip]LB[io:A]C[Ilya: Locally A is a bit better (but of course moves I showed ealier are still much bigger).]

;W[lm];B[in];W[jn];B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[np];B[lp]LB[mq:A][oq:B]
C[Ilya: It is better to protect at A. In this case next white move at B is not forcing.]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[or];B[ns]C[Ilya: This is gote. It was better to play sente moves somewhere else first.]

[ek:F][ko:C][og:D][os:B]C[In retrospect I realize this was too far.  Do you think the biggest remaining points are in this area or should I have played somewhere else?

Ilya: Yes probably. And anyway if you played closer to your stones you'd end up in gote. I marked all moves which are sente for you. You'd better play them first.]
