C[Kyo: Hello !

I am Kyoshinai, playing Black.

Except for the two huge mistakes in the endgame, I did not feel that I made big mistakes, and the game was quite close.

Please point out everything you feel relevant, especially durng the yose, which I'm very bad at.

Thank you :)];B[pd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 4k in my country ranks. I hope you'll find my comments useful.]

;B[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[pm]C[Kyo: I did not really know how to deal with that...

dede: This move is bad. Contact play will make B corner stones stronger.  W don't want it, because O3 and friends have bad shape and are unstable. May be W tries to play some kind of sabaki, but here it is unnecessary. R8 would be better, but first of all W should repair shape with for instance L2..]
