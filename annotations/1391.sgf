AB[pd][dp]C[My
opponent here was listed as 8 kyu but after the game I read the kibbiz by
the spectators. These included a 1dan and a 3kyu who both knew my opponent.
They discussed Fallafels real rank and agreed on 5kyu. This of course I didn't
knew until after the game.];W[pq];B[dd];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[dn]

It looks OK to me. other possible moves around the marked points.]
;W[qp]
(;B[op]LB[jd:A]C[I
don't like this move. the reason is the wite wall. your move aims to make
influence, which is good but the influence you get is in the same area as
the white wall has. I would extend along the side instead, or leave this
area for now and take the big point at A. See variations.];W[oq]

(;B[nc]C[see
variation];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qk]C[this is not so efficient because it is
too close to the wall below it and it does not put somuch presure on white.
Compare it with the variation at move 27.];W[lc]

always miss this kind of move. Not seeing and playing the vitalpoint instead

but you can always connect using the tesuji at M18. For a demonstration see variation.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[dl];B[ch]C[Again going for the large point instead of the safe point.
To
be honest, I like this move. Of course white can invade the corner, but i
find it difficult to believe that he can completely kill the black stones
in the corner. I think that after the invasion, black can get something in
return for the corner (like attack on the C8 stones). But i am only 4k :-)
I might be wrong.];W[cq]

him in the begining but  after 20 moves or so I saw he was better then me.]
