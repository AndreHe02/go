C[Ltn:  Hi, I'm Ltn and I play black in this game.

Hello, I'm djna.

Ltn: Thank to take some time for reviewing my game. I appeciate it
Ltn: Somehow I manage to win it, but more by luck by anything else, evan if we both done VERY big mistake.

My overall impression is that B was putting pressure on W and probably
should win. W gave opportunities for B to attack. With correct play B
should make the attacks work. Sometimes in such games B makes 
mistakes and then W can win. Here B kept things together well.

Ltn:  Please, don't review all the game, I just have specifics question about general strategie.

Ltn: Right from the start, I build strenght, while white build territory. I just want to be sure I use this strenght / influence rightly

Ltn:  so please, comment especially the following moves:
13 : direction of play
45 :direction of play
53 :What's the best joseki to use in this case ?
57 : direction of play
89 : the way to attack



I think that this is a very good way to seek advice. You ask questions
about strategic ideas rather than tactical sequences. I believe that
this is a good thing for a review.


Ltn: Don't mind the Ltn:  I put before my sentence. It helps me to sort out, witch was my original sentence, and witch was you're reply

I usually mark my comments with djna.

Ltn:  I'm french, so if you are, or want to answer in french, no problem :)

I wish my French was good enough :-( 

Ltn:  Thank again

Overall, B does well in building thickness and handles the fights pretty well but in two cases misses the killing move. B has already discovered some other tactical errors.

W was very tenacious, and close to exploiting those tactical errors to get a victory.  W got into some unreasonable fights because he allowed B to build too much thickness and started fights in areas where B was strong.]
;B[dp]C[daba [8k\]: hi];W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[kp]C[djna - standard opening]
;W[oq]LB[pj:B][pm:C][cn:A]C[djna - normally bad for W. Too easy for B to force W to a heavy 
shape and attack.

W often plays at the makrked places instead];B[op]LB[pq:A]C[djna - makes life easy for W. B wants W to run with a heavy group to the
centre and let B build to left and right. A is better to achieve this.]
;W[pq];B[pp];W[qq]LB[kp:C][pp:A][oq:B]C[djna - now it's like W played 3-3 invasion under A and Black didn't hane at B. 
Something is not efficient for B. C doesn't feel like it's in a helpful place either.

But W should not be too happy, why is he playing invasions so early in the game?
B is getting thickness.];B[rq]LB[rp:A]C[
djna - don't play moves that leave a weakness you don't want to protect.

Perhaps just play A. It's very hard for W to ignore so you probably keep sente.]
;W[rr];B[qf]LB[pj:B][qj:A][op:C]TR[rp]C[Ltn: What about this one ?
Ltn: The idear was to build a largs side, or chase any white stone comming this way

djna - ok, so the proverb says "play away from thickness" and that's what you are aimng to do. So it's a reasonable idea, provided that you have good thickness.
Now there's something odd to me about this B wall, probably because of the marked defect. Also it's not a *very* big wall.

Another proverb says "extend 3 from a wall of 2, 4 from a wall of 3. In other words the natural sphere of infliuence of your wall is probably not as far as where you've gone to.

I think that the proper move is to extend to A, but this is  a bit slow. 

My conclusion is that the wall you built is not really optimal. Compare with a san-ren-sai opening when you already have an extension at B.  

C was the origin of a problem.];W[qh]LB[qk:A]C[Ltn: White wasn't to happy with my side ;-)

djna - W can be praised for resisting B's
plan. As W has room to form a base at A
this is probably OK, certainly interesting!];B[of]LB[qc:A][qk:B]
C[
djna - I prefer this to playing A. W would end up with a wall opposing yours and W would be able to extend to B to nullify the B wall.]

(;W[nc]C[djna - see  variations for discussion of joseki choice.]
;B[pi];W[pg]C[djna - not joseki, things now get messy.

Look at the variation for the joseki line.
B should review the position he expected to reach when he played the joseki.]
;B[pf];W[og];B[ng]C[djna - Getting a little exciting. 

B is doing well to resist strongly.];W[rj]LB[nf:A]C[Ltn:  I suspect this move to be very bad
Ltn: P12 seems quit better

djna - yes S10 is very bad, R11 probabaly results in a live group. P12 may give W a floating weak group and long term trouble.

Ltn:  From now, I will try to kill the white stones

djna - W is in real trouble now. B does have to watch that cutting point at A. 

The danger in these tight tactical situations is to lose sight of the overall strategic goals. Killing is good, but staking the whole game on being able to kill is not good. 

I think that the primary objective should be to confine W and build strength on the outside. If W grovels on the second line and lives then you are still happy. If you have a strong group and W has to run away then you are happy.]
;B[qi];W[ri]SQ[oh]
(;B[rg];W[rh];B[qg];W[ph]C[
djna - seems like a bad exchange? reduces liberties on B for no benefit?]
;B[oi]LB[qg:1][ph:2][oi:3]C[djna - whenever you consider any sequence 1-2-3 always consider "suppose I just play 3"

Often "just 3" is good, and may well save ko threats!];W[ql]
TR[rg]SQ[op][pp][qp]C[djna - this is irritating, W lives too easily and I can't see a good alternative for B. 

I show an alterntive line instead of the marked stone but I don't really like it.

The reason that W is not punished is that your wall is too far away to give enough help.]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[ol];W[qm];B[rn];W[om];B[nm];W[pl];B[nl];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[on];B[nn];W[qn]LB[nf:B][nh:C][nq:A]TR[nk][nl][nm][nn]
C[djna - worth reviewing the situation here.

W forced B into making a very solid marked wall. This is B's major success.

A is a big point for W and sente against the stones above.  So the bottom may not be a big B area.

There are some other defects in B's wall, B and C look like potential problems. How much more strength does W need before he dare cut?

You are correct to indentify this as a major decision point in the game.]

(;B[lc]LB[rd:A]TR[nf]SQ[of][pf][qf][qg][rg]C[Ltn: He manage to live, but I was happy :

Ltn:  1. He have no real territory in the side
Ltn:  2. I build a nice wall

Ltn:  But now I have to use this wall, how to do that?

Ltn:  what about M17 ?

djna - For this to be good move we need 

1). it's a real threat to create a weak W group.
Again, we don't need to kill, but this must be real threat to do so.

2). W cannot afford to ignore it - could W sacrifice the whole corner?

3). We need to be strong enough in the surrounding area. We're stimulating another battle. That cutting point worries me.

4). It's urgent. Would W get time to protect here if you don't play here? Is there somewhere bigger to play.

My feeling is, we pass tests 1 & 2. 3 I'm a bit more doubtful about. But we fail 4. W can't take time to play a defensive move at the top (e.g. A, A is big but Black can ignore it - notice than unless you are attacking the W corner you can sacrifice the 5 marked stones. Getting 2 moves elswhere on teh baord is worth more at the moment.]
;W[qd];B[nd];W[od];B[mc]C[Ltn: this one was a mistake ! (see variation)]

(;W[nb]C[Ltn: But I was lucky, whote doesn't use it :-)];B[ne]
C[Ltn:  So I was able to protect

djna - good result for B suddenly his wall is very strong. W has a solid corner but no potential for expansion]
;W[fq]C[Ltn:  Like before in my wariation

Ltn:  I suppose I have to use a joseki who press white down, but doesn't find any :-(((]

(;B[eq]LB[dn:A]C[
djna- this attachment is best when W cannot extend so far from his two stones.

I would just play A.

In this area W is entitiled to life and you just want a share of the corner. You cannot attack this stone very strongly.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[iq];B[fc]LB[cl:D][cn:B][dn:A][eq:C]TR[nb]C[Ltn:  good move ?
Ltn:  C14 Better ?


Normally you don't try to build in an area where you are open skirted (marked W stone) but here you have such huge central influence I think this is good. You aim to build a huge moyo.

BUT, if you play to play this then A should be at B, or instead of C you should be playing B.

A is high and vulnerable to moves at D.];W[hc];B[fe];W[cf]

Ltn:  1. kill them is possible ;-)
Ltn:  2. Else using this threat to build the right side

Ltn: Is this strategie good ?


Ltn:  and is C12 the move for the job ?

djna - this is excellent.

Your suggested variations allow w an easy life
on the side. Calculating whether they
give you enough in the middle is too difficult.

What you play in the game really puts pressure on W and fits with the rest of the game.

In the game W didn't die, but in fact you did kill him. Notice also that the upper W group is also dead after A. 

Your strategy has worked. You just fouled up a few tactics. 

I don't do any more detailed comments after this. The game is actually over!]

So how does B feel about this?

My current thinking is to try to always prefer thickness to territory.  Here I feel that B is a little behind because the marked stones are not working well.

Overall, I think B gets into a more interesting game by playing this way. If the result is not perfect here, it probably comes from the original move at A]
