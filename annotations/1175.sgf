RE[W+4.5]

;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]C[This is a mistake.
It is now (or some moves later) good for white to approach  at P4 or P3. You would like to pincer
(around M4), but your pincer stone will not really be placed well (between P4 and D4).

Better play Q3. If then Q5 your pincer becomes a good move as it is also an extension from Q16.]
;W[op];B[lp];W[qq]C[This is not so good with that pincer.
White will not have a good extension  after Black S3, White Q3]
;B[rq]C[Good!];W[pq];B[ro];W[qn]C[R6 not very josekish to me ...

True: R6 is bad. But black has to cut  white into pieces now! Black Q5 is obligatory. After that two white  groups are under attack.]
;B[dc]C[I thoght S3 group could be on its own for now, and I could take corner while leaving Q5 aji.

Not good! Now white should play  Q5 or R5 attacking your group.
You would have to run out on the second line. White would get the superior position. Furthermore:  your stone at M4 would then not be in a good position.
For both of you Q5 is such an urgent point. Both of you would probably  answer if the other plays Q5. That means: there is no room to leave Q5 for later.]
;W[ce]C[Probably for the next 20 moves I could always write: Q5 would be better then that move. Look at the difference if white or black plays it! Do you see it? One cannot leave that point.]
;B[fd];W[ch];B[cd];W[de];B[hd];W[jp]C[Very good move! (after Q5)]
;B[qj]C[R10 correct ?

No. You cannot really ignore the attack against your M4 stone. Still Q4 the most urgent point. But still: R10 is a good point. (White must play Q5 or R5 now)]
;W[jc]C[This move is the wrong area.
The lower part of the board is hot.
Also localy: K17 can be easily attacked.
White is only producing a problem for himself. Locally O17 would be better (but Q5 is necessary)]
;B[lc]C[Good attack!];W[gc];B[fc]C[or G16 ?

G16 is much better. Keep your stones connected! If you want to fight you could play H17 (which gives a good fight for you). F17 is to soft.]
;W[gd]C[Sure!];B[ff];W[ge];B[fe];W[hc];B[ke]C[Good! Attacks the white group and maps out a moyo on the upper right. Hard to say who has the lead now. It still seems to me: The one who plays Q5 will have the lead.]
;W[gf];B[cn]C[not good! Whites attack at C8 or C9 looks very good now.

The other side looks better: F3.  There is some hope that the white stone on K4 could come under pressure.

But in general: It is rather funny!
Both of you start fights everywhere and you leave those hot positions!  1. White attacked your stone M4 but did not continue.

2. Your stones around R4 can be attacked or can attack, depending who plays Q5.

3. You attacked the white stones at G17 but now you stopped.

In general one should continue all those attacks! If you are the one attacking you  should always be able to get a lot of strength (or profit) while attacking.]
;W[cl]C[Good!];B[fq];W[fp]C[A little doubtful because it weakens the white stone at K4. Better E5 or C3]
;B[cq]C[Black must play G4!  (hoping to weaken K4)];W[cp];B[dq]
;W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[gq];W[gp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fh]
C[Good move as it is splitting white apart.
There are so many urgent points now on the board! H4/H3 is also very urgent.]
;W[eg]C[Not good! Helps black! The whites stones G17 will get even weaker.

Good moves for white:
Q5, H3, J15];B[fg];W[be];B[bd];W[hq]C[Good!];B[ln]C[looking left and right (Q5)

I dont really see the look to the left.
White has to play Q5 now! It is the only move.];W[nc]C[Yet another attacking field! But it rather looks as if white wants to create one more problem for himself. Putting a weak stone at O17 doesnt work when there is such a weak white group (G17)]
;B[oc]C[Black N16 looks better.];W[lb]C[Interesting move. White succesfully strengthens his weak stones. But black O16 is now huge! This is a high price for white.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nd];W[qf]C[again not good. This white stome is to weak.]
;B[qh]C[It is better to play from the other side first (R15). It will be much harder for white (if not impossible) to save his stone.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[of];B[ni];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh]C[You want to defend against the cut at P11. But if you look at that cut you see, that part of that cut is already defended.

This means: E.g. N10 is much more efficient then P11. It also helps to stop white moving left. Maybe even better would be N13.  Another strong move would be R13 threatening Q14.]
;B[oi]C[not so good.];W[qg]C[White gets good shape! Thats why black R13 would have been strong.]
;B[rh];W[qd];B[qb];W[mg];B[nb]C[too small, despite sente ?

This is hard to tell. I find that move good.];W[kc];B[po]C[Finally!]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[on];B[pn];W[pm];B[oo]C[No! Black is taking away his own liberties! R7 is corect.]
;W[no];B[om];W[qo]C[Good!];B[nn];W[pp];B[on];W[rp]C[White is out of trouble now. Blacks stones at Q11 are not so much worth anymore.]
;B[qm];W[pl]C[In the game this becomes a wasted move.];B[rn]
;W[mn]C[Bad move.  White should play R4! Black would probably defend against the cut at S7. There is one more problem with this N6: white will need one more move to defend his three stones. Moreover the move Q8 was a wasted move if white allows the capture at R4.]
;B[qp]C[This is a little dangerous. White might play N7. The three black stones to the left  might die. This could become bigger then blacks gain on the right side. Further more black would need one more move to really make the profit. I would play Black N7 here and keep R4 in reserve. (Of course if white captures back the whole thing is an even bigger success for black)]
;W[qo]C[All the last white moves were a little like running here and there without any success. Black got far to much from that fight. White should try N7 (or should never have made moves like Q8 and N6)]
;B[mm]C[Yes! Now blacks position is superior.];W[mq];B[lq];W[qp]
C[Not good! But white is in a bad position here. Black could capture three black stones with O4. Play it out yourself:
Black O4 if whiteN4: Black O3, White N2, Black O2, White M2 Black L2, and there is no hope for the white stones.]
;B[np]C[Good! You have seen that attack!];W[qn];B[ql];W[jr]
C[Strange move. It doesnt help the attacked white group, as black could seperate (e.g. with M2) and attack at the same time.]
;B[li]C[1st mistake.
I should have taken at N4, fonrcing R3 group to get alive.

Yes. But even better moves are moves like M2 or O3 (also capturing the three stones, but making it more difficult for white to live).]
;W[lh]C[White should play N4 and be happy again.];B[ki];W[mp]
C[Good! Now black cannot capture anymore with O3.Now White threatens M7.]
;B[mr];W[nq];B[lm]C[That means: N4 was sente. White got his group to live in sente!]
;W[jg]C[It is more important for white to do something for the left side now. Black moves like C10 look worrysome now.]
;B[kh];W[kg];B[mh];W[lg];B[ie]C[stupid];W[le]C[Good!];B[me]
;W[lf]C[Two empty triangles! White should play M16: More efficient.]
;B[ig];W[if];B[hf];W[jf];B[hg];W[he];B[eh];W[ej]C[This looks a little thin. D10 is more solid.]

(;B[di]C[not very efficient in the end ..
there might have been better (C13 ?)
Yes, probably. But the difference is not so big. White answers C13 with D12. I commented your variation.]
;W[cj]C[White should play C11.];B[ci];W[bi];B[dg]C[Far to small. Black should play B10. White has to defend against B12, and then Black breaks through at D10.]
;W[dj];B[cg];W[bg];B[ef]C[Big mistake! There are still many big moves. This gives you just 2 points in Gote. Play elsewere! Somewhere in the center. E14 is purely an endgame move and a small one! E.g. H2 or is a bigger endgame move.]
;W[il]C[I should have played this earlier ...];B[jn]C[J6 is bigger. You might even activate the cut at H4 later.]
;W[in];B[jo];W[io];B[gj]C[again: G9 is possible. and gives white more problems.]
;W[fk];B[gk]C[This sequence helps white to solidify his teritory.]
;W[gl];B[fl]C['time' move.
I dont understand this remark.];W[gm];B[fj];W[ek];B[gb];W[hb]
;B[fb];W[so];B[rm];W[kk];B[jl]C[Good! L9 was an overplay.];W[jh]
;B[jk];W[gg];B[hh];W[gh];B[hi];W[nh];B[mi];W[gs]C[mistake. Corect: H2. After the sequence in the game black still has  a rather big move at H2.]
;B[fr];W[ij]C[This is a neutral point. Playing there is close to worthless.]
;B[ik];W[fi]C[I dont think black has to defend here any further. Black should now play the sente move A5 before white plays there.]
;B[jj];W[ii];B[hk];W[ap];B[aq];W[bs];B[ds];W[fs]C[Mistake! Black answers H2 capturing the stones G1 and F1.]
;B[cr];W[nr];B[se];W[re];B[sf];W[lr];B[hr]C[If you see that move: C2 was a wasted move!]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[ms];B[iq];W[hp];B[jq];W[ks];B[kq];W[hs]C[G2 is bigger.]
;B[gr];W[cs]C[Very good move! defends against black K1 followed by E1.]
;B[br];W[js];B[as];W[is]C[White should rather play A5 and leave the three stones to black, if black wants them.]
;B[es];W[ls];B[ip]C[Black A5 is a big sente! If white answers A6 black plays a huge Ko with B6 which could decide the game. This J4 is not so  big]
;W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bb];W[bh]C[What is that move for? looks like a wasted move.]
;B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[ld];B[md]C[Black must feel very sad about that! M16 was always Blacks sente move. Black should have always been able to play M16 and white would have answered. Black doesnt really need to answer white M16. White destroyed Blacks sente move and kept sente! You must feel hurt about that. Try to feel it.]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[dh];B[ei];W[gi];B[hj];W[pe];B[nf];W[ng];B[ma]
;W[ka];B[sn];W[sp];B[sc]C[Both of you dont see A5?
T17 is bad. Now white T16 is an attack against both sides. locally T18 is better.]
;W[sd];B[sb]C[second one. This is a real blunder.
What else? T17 was the blunder.];W[sg]C[White should finally play A5! Much bigger.]
