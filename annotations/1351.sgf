C[laver: Hi, in this match I am black.
I present you many of the thoughts I had during the match, hoping to give you some idea on what to comment about.
Anyway, I will appreciate particularly comments not related to my considerations. New ideas are the best way to impreve oneself.
I am interested in comments about both sides.

tanguy: I will try to answer to your questions. and give a lot of variations
that come to my mind.
This does not mean that this variations are optimal.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]
(;W[kd]LB[nc:A][kd:C][de:D][pf:B][jp:F][mp:E][jq:G]C[laver: I've never seen that move.
By sure the vital points in the fuseki change a lot w.r.t. white 'a', but I'm not such a strong player. I know that things change, but I don't know how they do that.
So, I play as usual, even if I know that I will have some surprise.

tanguy: yes this is a strange move,
the usual approaches are at
A, E, F or G.

A good way to juge such a position is to
use tewari (reversing moves order)
from the standard sequence  A,B,C,D.
(see previous variation).]
(;B[jp]C[tanguy: ok wait and see...];W[qo]C[laver: white is bad here. This move is too deep, especially after black K4. Now it's time to take advantage of this bad move.

tanguy: agreed
white is jumping into fire.];B[qp];W[rp]
(;B[rq]LB[po:A]C[This move seems ok
but A is also playable,
black is happy to wall white,]
(;W[pp];B[qq];W[ql];B[op];W[po];B[pj]C[laver: white is with unsettled shape, while black has good profit at the bottom. Nice!]

(;W[qi]C[laver: white seems nasty, but I think he's playing worse and worse. By sure he will have two weak groups to take care of.

tanguy: white move is an overplay.];B[pl]C[Good !
white is going to suffer a lot.];W[rl];B[rk];W[oo];B[np];W[qf]
TR[ql][rl][oo][po][qo][pp][rp]C[tanguy:for me this is overplay,
white delta group is almost dead now.]
(;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[pm]LB[mk:B][ol:A]C[laver: white made black huge at the bottom. He has two groups under attack, so black has nothing to worry about his group on the right.
Good for black :)
But now, how to exploit this advantage? No idea...


tanguy: yes develop the cutting group  with A or B  and see what will appen.]
;B[ol];W[mb]C[tanguy: yet another stange move]
(;B[nb]C[tanguy: wrong direction balck want to
kill one of the 2 white groups not
make points in the corner.];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[rf]C[laver: white is worse and worse. Now black has a very strong group in the corner, while white has nothing at the top.
I think it's time for black to exploit white's weaknesses.

tanguy: now white made shape in the
north: time to attack the south.];B[nn]C[tanguy: mm hard to say, this move seems ok.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[on]
(;B[rn]C[laver: most probably this is a very stupid move from a strategical point of view. O7 encloses white in sente, which would be very nice for black.
I was too greedy...

tanguy: the point is that it is better  to know the issue of the battle before
its begining.
My opinion is that stealing white eyes
and see how white will do with his 2 weak
groups is more fun than walling.];W[ro];B[rm];W[qm];B[sl]
(;W[sm]LB[sm:1]C[tanguy: this sacrifice is interesting.
At he cost of 1 point white steals half
a liberty to black.  Is it a necessary move ?];B[sn];W[qn];B[sm]
;W[nm]LB[om:1][pn:2][so:3][sp:4]C[tanguy: the number of liberies is the same for white.]
;B[mn];W[om]
(;B[ml]TR[ml]C[laver: from a tactical perspective, this is bad, I think. BNlack can do nothing for blocking white, which is getting much stronger.

tanguy: the first Idea of exploiting both white groups weakness is still good.
splitting attack is a good strategy here.
delta is too close and does not work.];W[mm];B[lm];W[nl];B[nk]
;W[mk];B[oj]C[tanguy: now black's cutting group has become weaker.]

(;W[ll]LB[nj:A]C[tanguy: better to play at A before.];B[mj]
C[laver: anyway, black still has the Q14 group to attack. The splitting attack is still present, even if now is less effective.

tanguy: yes];W[lj];B[mi];W[li];B[mh];W[mf];B[lh];W[ln];B[km]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[lp];B[ko];W[nq];B[oq];W[nr]C[tanguy: let's count the liberties.
black: 5
white: 5
but its black turns now =>  he should win this semeai.]
(;B[kq]C[laver: I misread the semeai. I think P2 is good, threatening N3, or even M2. If white playsto protect the cut, black makes life in the corner with S2, for instance. White has no hope.
Unortunately, by feeling that, I played thoughtlessly.

this move is a bit slow
now the diragnositc is
white: 6 libs
black 6 libs  + white turn];W[or];B[pr];W[rr]
(;B[os]C[tanguy: there are many other moves  to try.];W[sq]
;B[mq]C[tanguy: big loss here.];W[qr]TR[le]C[laver: Ok, the fighting is definitely lost. But since white played so bad in the beginning, I think the match is still open. Black is very thick at the bottom, he has lots of ko threats, white has few points of territory more than black.
The question is: how to attack the left side?
This is a problem of direction of play. I decided to attck D4 by exploiting my thickness. Do you see anything better?

tanguy: M15 is also interesting
but it does not seem to work right now.]
(;B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[laver: I think white is bad. Black gets the corner, while white's thickness will be facing black's one, so it will be pretty much useless.

tanguy: I would have calmly answered
at f3 to erase blacks power.
but this is playable.]

(;B[gq]TR[cl]C[laver: White gets really nothing :)
tangy: he gets a lot: delta is really a big point.];W[bl]C[laver: that move seems to me slow, but white will capture the two stones in sente... So I respond.]
