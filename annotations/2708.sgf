AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[This game is played on IGS August 16, 2004

The player is 17k* IGS, I'm not sure about my rank

I played Black.];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[ne]C[does this work? i'm sure B-O16 is a common choice, but then after W-N14, White  got a quite influence to the center.

It is usually not played, because it allows white to approach later at N17 or O17.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[nf]C[Here you must be consistent with your previous move.

No need to fear the pincer on the R12 stone, since it can still escape in the center.]

;W[ro]
(;B[qr];W[rr];B[rl]C[this is a yose move - white may decide to play elsewhere.

And if you want to attack white, better play S1 first.];W[rm]

(;B[bj]C[the first line is called the "line of defeat" :-)
this is small];W[cj]

;B[de];W[cc];B[cd];W[db]
(;B[bc]C[is this move a blunder? or e19 is better? I feels like if B-E19 white will live on the corner.

Yes, white can easily live in the corner if you play E19 - see variation.

So your move is not a bad move.];W[ea]

Yes, it is the standard response.];W[lb]C[White exploits the weakness...]

;W[lq];B[lp];W[mp];B[mq];W[kp];B[mo];W[kq];B[lr]C[wrong for three reasons :
1. weakens K3
2. gote

I still prefer moves like O6];W[kr];B[ls];W[ks];B[nr];W[jp]

(;B[gq]C[wrong]
(;W[jl];B[gm]C[i'm not sure about this move. but i feel that i have to reduce white influence in the center... is it too far?

No, not too far... anyway if white tries to cut, you can escape towards the top groups (which makes me think you could even play further)]

yes, O17 is better - you must protect your territory];W[nc]
;B[mc];W[me];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc]C[yes, this is necessary];W[le]
C[and now white can cut];B[nb];W[ne];B[pa]C[i manage to make the group alive. but resulting black stones L15 and M14 in danger probably dead.]
;W[kf]
(;B[rb]C[should have played m13 or n13 instead

yes, probably];W[lg]
(;B[ln]C[What is the purpose of this move ?
It's almost a dame.

Instead, you should maybe have protected the cutting point at O7 like in the variation]

C[again... is this too far?

No, but there are not much points left in the area...];W[nj]

Please make a summary of my game.

You played quite well in the beginning.
Until black N16 (move 104), black is largely ahead.
