;B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn]LB[pd:C][cl:B][em:A][pn:D]C[reid: This push by black is "aji-keshi" which means black may be throwing away some potential aji that he may want to save until later.  The main idea here is that right now black doesn't know which of D6, A (E7), or something along the side like B (C8) is going to be the most important.  So leaving the decision for later is a good idea.

Black could just play C now, or D is pretty goo d too (making it hard for white to invade the lower side).]
;W[cm];B[pd];W[nq]C[reid: This deep invasion seems too early for white.  In general, you want to choose your battles such that you can fight with an advantage.  This usually means fight where you have more stones than your opponent.  Here, white chooses to start where black already has a pretty strong advantage.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
;B[pn]LB[om:A]C[reid: Here black A would be better.  Since black already has the investment of D6 on the left (he exchanged influence for white territory), he should make this moyo grow larger.  Q6 is pushing from behind - not usually a good idea.  In this case, black pushes white towards q16, reducing the value of the high outpost in the uppr right.

However, black still seems to get a better board position - Q6 vs. P7 is a small issue.  Black's moyo is impressive no matter what.]
;W[jq]LB[qo:B][ip:A]C[reid: This invasion is certainly too soon.  If black just plays A, for example, white will have a hard time.  He may be able to live here, but it will be small life, and black will get massive thickness.  And white still has a problem at B.]
;B[qo]C[reid: Too soon!  White owes a move here, but black's moyo on the bottom is bigger.  Black should defend the moyo first., then come back later for R5.

You should try to get a feel for the rhythm of the stones.  A deep invasion like this has two reasonable outcomes: either white lives in gote, or he dies (not in gote we hope!).  Thyis means black should take the fight to its natural conclusion here first.  Then, if white manages to live, black R5 is a natural (and very large) continuation.

By pushing at R5 first, black misses the chance to fight where he has an overwhelming advantage.]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[qm]C[reid: This was black's last chance to defend the moyo.  Taking this one stone is big, but the moyo is bigger.]
;W[nr];B[os];W[fr];B[es]LB[fp:A]C[reid: Black may think he must keep white separated here, but black A (F4) would be a safer move (better shape).

Letting white connect is actually not very big.];W[hp];B[gp]
;W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[iq];W[fp];B[go]C[reid: I think black is expecting too much here.  Black ignored a white move inside his moyo, and now it looks like he expects to kill the invading white stones.  This is not reasonable.  Black is no longer strong on the lower left, white can probably live.]
;W[ir]LB[fo:A]C[reid: If white continues with A instead of J2, the black group on the left could be in trouble.]
;B[fo];W[lp];B[kr]C[reid: Black L2 is a real problem.  Black is expecting white to answer at A, but even if white meekly connects, the exchange is better for white than for black.  L2 is a "thank you" move.]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[mr]C[reid: Urk - terrible shape.

Black  has four liberties, white also has four, but it's black's move.  Black can capture the three stones.]
;B[mp];W[np];B[kp]LB[lo:A][mo:C][mq:B]C[reid: This is the kind of move that black should make only after reading out all the possibilities.  Because if it goes wrong, it could be disasterous.

When white answers this by extending to A (M5), black's path is much harder to see.  If instead black just connects at B (N3), then the black and the white groups have 4 liberties each.  But since black has the atari at A (M5), white cannot seal black in with C (N5).]
;W[lo];B[jr];W[jp];B[mq]LB[ln:C][io:F][jo:D][ko:B][mo:A][ip:E]
C[reid: Another misread by black: If black plays A instead, white cannot cut with N3 because of black B through F.]
;W[mo]C[reid: Now the black group cannot be saved.];B[ms];W[js]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[ip];W[kp]C[reid: At this point, white has about 12 points in the lower left, maybe four in the lower right, and 14 in the lower center.  The two upper corners are even, so black has only the thickness from capturing R6 to go against white's 30 points of cash.

Once white lives with a fairly large territory in the middle of black's moyo, the game is over.

In go, one must always judge the relative size of moves.  The person with the better judgment, the one who sees the truth more clearly, is almost always the stronger player.

In this game, black judged that taking at R6 was larger than letting white get an extra move inside his moyo.  Normally, taking R6 is just too big.  But in this game, black's only compensation for letting white have two corners was his bottom-side moyo.  Taking R6 in exchange for losing the moyo was simply too small.

Analysis ends here.];B[ed];W[gc];B[ef];W[ec];B[dc];W[dd];B[fc]
