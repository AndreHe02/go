C[Hi, I am white in this game and I was totally outgunned by my opponent, I think I didn´t handle the 3-3 invasion on my moyo very well, could you please give me some sugestions on how I should have dealt with it? thanks in advance

--
Sure. This was an interesting game to comment.
Opening was weard (but not bad) and thinking correct moves wasn't easy to me. 
 
The reason for your loss was interesting.
I hope you get some new ideas!

(I don't know how to remove variations so my bad ideas are included also. Don't take them too seriously.)

High approach with P4 or O4 probably better because B's Q10 stone. Now B P4 is a nice move.]

Black could also pincer and make it complicated.

Nice move, but I still prefer keeping the corner.]

Big, but not necessary.]

Luckily B didn't take sente.

Good point but it is a little bit uneffective. 
See variation.];B[cd];W[ej]C[Was this the right time for this move? or shoul I have first tried to ensure the corner?

--
This is a good move and it has good follow ups like C14 and F4. I think this is the correct idea.]
;B[cq]C[The 3-3 invasion that gave me all the trouble

--
Black is forced to this invasion. There should be no problems.]

(;W[dq]C[I think that I responded in the wrong direction, maybe playing at C4 would have been better?

--
Hard to say. Maybe C4 slightly better because now C10 and E10 stones look weard.]

;B[gj]C[Right, I don´t really know how to deal with this move, I think he just hit in the right spot, is there any good move to counter this?

--
B has to fight. So you should give him what he wants. There are a lot of aji in B's position.]

(;W[bd]C[--
This is not the correct strategy in positions like this. You have a lot of influence so you should fight.

This move and following tactical sequences are
the main reason for your loss. This move ignores whole board! 

See variations.];B[ce];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb];B[jd]C[--
Now B's G10 is a lot stronger. 
:(];W[be]C[--
Yes, you don't want to be even surrounded.];B[cf]C[B looks now better because he can counter your lower side moyo with G10. G10 is not weak anymore. 

--
Finding opponents weak points like R8 is important and there is still a change.]
;W[ee]C[I was trying to make him defend the upper side to maybe capture the G10 stone in a large scale

--
Shape point. Unfortunately B is pretty strong in upper side so this is an overplay. :(]

Good move but bad timing. It is almost too late
to attack against B effectively because you have streghten B's center group.]

(;W[ji]C[was this move apropriate? was there another move that I could have made to weaken this group?

This move is strenghtening B. B is strong. Attacking B's center seems hard for W. 

There are some possibilities with W K9 B K10 W N9.]
(;B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[il];B[ik];W[nk]C[Now I wanted to separate both walls to capture at least one of them, but I think that I got it wrong somewhere

(;W[lh]C[was this move necessary? was there another sequence that I could have played?

--
W M12 is very important, but if you want to win this game you can not sacrifice N9 stones. 

It seems that M12 is a must if you want to save your G12 group.]
;B[lm]C[There, he managed to capture the 3 stones, or is ti a way to save them?

Seems impossible.];W[ll];B[km];W[mm];B[mn];W[om];B[on];W[oj]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[ok];W[ol];B[oj]C[I lost the semeai by one move

--
Game over. No more comment after this point.

Your fuseki was powerful and I think you were slightly better off in the beginning. 

G10 was a normal reducing move which totally confused you. This game was a good example how to play tactically well but by ignoring whole board aspects it can result a terrible position.

I hope you get some fresh ideas.
