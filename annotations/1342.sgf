C[Hello reviewer.  My name is Mark Fyffe, and I played white.  I am 5k on IGS. I felt pretty comfortable with this game while I was playing it, but it became clear later on that I was not seeing all of the aji.  I hope you can help me to find some of it ;-)]

C[>What would you suggest at this point? is there any disadvantage to this play, or advantage to another?

All I can say is that you're falling in with W's plan. This is exactly the kind of development the chinese fuseki aims at. If you want to prevent it, the 'standard' way is playing on the upper side before the lower side. For example N16 instead of O3.]

(;B[qe]LB[nd:A]C[This move is bad. The W stone is caught in a pincer, and is a weak stone -- attaching to it is in general not a good idea, unless it is to make the stone heavy. I have seen B play as in the variation, and it leads to crazy fighting, but playing A is the traditional way.]
;W[qf];B[qd]
(;W[pf]C[This move is very bad. You just made your stones live or die as a unit, so now they are very heavy. When playing in the opponent's sphere of influence, you must not only be prepared to sacrifice stones, but actively looking for ways to sacrifice. Connecting your stones like this makes it impossible to sacrifice.]

Yes. The B stones are no weaker than the W stones. I see a huge problem for W in managing the upper right group which has no clear eye shape, nothing to connect to and is too big to be sacrificed. Creating another weak group would be very dangerous for W.]

W lost the game when his upper right stones were captured. This was a terrible misfortune, as W was ahead most of the game, but failed to make his positions secure and win the game. The fighting in this game seems to have no proper direction, like the players are attacking without purpose or consideration for the global situation.

I think that in order to improve you need to focus on positional judgement. That involves counting. It also involves looking at the whole board and not playing moves with no clear purpose.]
