C[Joonas Tyystj√§rvi: I've added some comments and variations throughout the game, please look at those. A general advice I might make from this game is to read the situation before defending, as sente can be very valuable.]
;B[dp];W[cd];B[pp];W[pc]LB[pd:C][qd:B][pe:A]C[JT: this gives black a very good approach at A. B or C is better here.]
;B[jp];W[pe]C[I tried to be rather territory orientated

JT: This is good - black 5 really should be here.];B[qj];W[ed]
LB[ic:A]C[JT: I think A is bigger, as it's also an extension from your shimari.]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[mc];W[dj];B[jj]
(;W[qo]C[now the target was to built up little towers inside the large layout

JT: this is a really heavy way to enter the black moyo. I've added some variations.]

(;B[po];W[qn];B[pn];W[qp];B[qq]C[JT: black overplayed here]
;W[pq];B[qr];W[oq];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql]LB[rl:A]C[JT: also, black could have played A here (although it's still a pretty bad result).]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[op];W[nq];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq];B[lp]

(;W[kq]LB[jr:A]C[JT: A is better here];B[jq]C[JT: this is a bad result for black]
;W[pr]LB[jr:A]C[JT: white has 7 liberties against black's 4 here, so this isn't really necessary. If you feel you absolutely must defend in a situation like this, it's better to at least play A (which is a big endgame move too).]
;B[kp];W[rl]C[JT: this is not very big.];B[rk]
(;W[cn]C[JT: this is big, but I don't think it's urgent to play here yet.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en]
(;W[dl]LB[em:B][co:A]C[JT: this is a pretty odd and somewhat slack move. If you want to take territory, you should play A. If you want to reduce, B is better than this.]
;B[co];W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[pk]LB[pf:A]C[JT: this is definitely an overplay. Simply A is good enough here.]
;B[qk];W[pj]TR[pk]C[JT: the triangled move was a successful forcing move. You got it basically for free, so you shouldn't try to rescue it like this - it's only making your forcing move heavy.]
;B[qi];W[qf];B[pi];W[mk]C[JT: again, this is extremely heavy - your 3 stones are against two thick black walls.]
;B[mi]C[i tried to count a little, finding myself in front if i could realise a large framework on the left]

(;W[nc]C[JT: this is pretty small];B[hm]C[roughly at that stage I was quite shure to be in front quite comfortely

JT: white is about 14 points ahead by my count, which is well enough at this point in the game.]
