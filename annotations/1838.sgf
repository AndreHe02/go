TR[qf]C[This is a two space extension.  The rule is "stand one, extend two: stand two, extend three".  In this case the W triangle stone is "Stand one", ie a one stone wall, so it seems that this two stone extension is correct.  However, if B now exchanges 'A' for 'B' W suddenly has a two stone wall and so should extend to 'C'.  Therefore it is standard in this shape for B to make the 'A-B' exchange, forcing W  into an over concentrated shape]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[kp]LB[qi:A][jp:B][kq:E][qq:D][pr:C]C[This is similar to the shape in the top right.  Because B has played on the 4th line it is better than W's 3rd line move at 'A'.  However, it is more common to extend to 'B', or play the sequence Bc-Wd-Be]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[np];B[mp];W[mo];B[no]LB[lp:B][op:A]C[This is a "thank you move".  Black gains nothing by it and loses a lot.  Once W has connected he loses some potential in the corner.  With a W stone at 'A" it is very possible that a life-saving atari will not be availalbe if B tries to invade.  B should just plzy at 'B'.  After all, the atari will still be there later unles W protects against it.   And is W does protect then B has sente and he has not lost his aji (threats) in the corner]
;W[op];B[lo];W[mn];B[lq]LB[mn:B][lo:A]C[The 'A-B' exchange strengthened W more than it did B and so should be left unplayed.  Just protect the cutting point and leave W to be the one to worry about a weakness.]
;W[mm]LB[nn:A]C[Very heavy.  Presumably W is trying to secure the capture of the one stone but a simple capture at 'A' is the best way to do this, leaving behind no threats at all for B.]
;B[cn]LB[dj:A]C[Two small.  'A' is the point on the left side and it is a betgter balance with the two star point stones.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[jd]LB[db:B][cc:C][ic:A][lc:D]C[Wrong.  Joseki calls for 'A'.  If W is going to play this then he should omit the 'B-C' exchange. This is also wrong because it permits B to play the multi-purpose move at 'D': undermining W and helping his own 2 stones.]

(;B[hc]C[This is a little precipitious when the w B stones to the right are not yet stable.  Look at the variation./]

;W[fe];B[hf];W[fg];B[gg]LB[ef:B][hg:A]C[Another gratuitous atari.  B expects W to connect and so he will have to connect at 'A' anyway.  Best just to play 'A' directly and leave the atari.  Once B is alive it may be more useful for him later to be able to peep at 'B']
;W[dg];B[cg];W[eg];B[gh]LB[ch:A]C['A' is more important.];W[cb]
;B[bb];W[jg];B[ig]LB[ff:A]C[Unnecesary.  B is already connected.  In fact, he can capture at 'A' in sente   He should be getting concerned about the 2 stones in the upper right.]
;W[jh]
(;B[rd]C[This is not the time to play light moves like this.  W can invade.  B needs to follow the variation shown.]
;W[jb]
(;B[ic]C[This move is almost never good.  B should block and play the ko as shown.]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[gb];B[mc];W[ib]LB[ic:A]C[It is a pity to let W make this connection.  Now there is no chance of ever developing an attack to the left.  This is the main reason that the connection at 'A' is bad.]
;B[di]LB[ch:B][ci:A]C[A little risky.  The B stones to the right and not alive and have no chacne to fight back against the nearby W stones now that W has connected underneath.  For this reason a solid move at 'A" is better.  It is very possible to imagine W being able to take advantage of the weakness at 'B' later if he gets strength from attacking the B group to the right.]

;W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh]LB[ni:A][oj:B]C['A' is better.  Secures the capture just as well and prevents the artari at 'B']
;W[oj];B[ni];W[nk];B[ok]LB[jl:A]C[Hopeless.  There is no way to make a live group in there.  Leave this one stone for aji and secure the lower center with a play at 'A']

C[This move loses the advantage B gained by his previous moves.  It should be at 'A' to cut off the 2 W stones.  After 'A' is does W no good to cut at 'B']
