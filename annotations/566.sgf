C[Hi,
This is a game that I lost, but I don't see an obvious game losing blunder. I am hoping to learn something that will improve my play. The questions are mine (fess, black) but Pekka (white) has also asked for a copy of the review, so I am sure he would appreciated comments directed at his play as well.]

(;B[pi]LB[pk:A]C[I considered playing at A here as in the high Chinese opening, but I had the thought that the game move would be a more severe pncer. Would A have been better?
Olaf: There is nothing wrong with Q11. In my eyes it is better than a move at A. In the chinese opening you would answer a kakari by attacking the white stone. But in these circumstances white would have sente and would be able to play a second stone against the chinese position. That would contradict the chinese strategy.]

(;W[rd]C[Olaf: dangerous. Black playes the pincer, if he will build a poition on the top. The normal way for white would be to move out first, to check this intention.]

(;B[qc]C[Olaf: not necessarily bad, as it leads to a well known joseki, but it looses a chance.]

(;B[qh]LB[mf:A][cn:C][fq:B]C[I didn't what to play here. I was afraid that I was just strengthening w with this move. Maybe I should have just left this side for now.
Olaf: That were right, you should leave the position for the time being. An urgent point is at A. other big points are at B or C.  If you want to do something locally later, see the variation.]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[qk];W[qi];B[pj];W[og];B[oh]C[Olaf: What function do your 2 stones have? Are they cutting stones? Are they necessary to secure your life? Do they treat to kill white? No, they are not necessary at all. Let white the fun to capture them and play elsewhere. Taking sente is much more important in this stage of the game the defending these 5 points.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[pm];B[ol];W[nn];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp]
C[I felt pretty good about this position. I was afraid that w would pincer my approach at the bottom left.]
;W[ld];B[me]C[Olaf: Hmm.., this is a good move if you can attack on both sides. But on the right, white is almost alive, so he can concentrade on the top, leaving you with nothing. In this position i would prefer the more peacefull way to play at M17.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[kd];B[jc];W[lc];B[lb]LB[nc:B][id:A]C[This move seemed like a mistake right after I played it. I now like A or B better.
Olaf: A seems good as it hems the whit group in a little bit. That would give you the chance of defending the corner in one way or another.]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[nc];B[oc];W[ob];B[md];W[mc];B[pb];W[oe];B[od]

(;W[rc]C[Olaf: why not jump to S18? This would leave black with no eye in the corner. White is strong on the right, so he will be able to manage the upper group easily by chasing the black group.]
;B[rb];W[id]C[Olaf: a move at R15 seems necessary now];B[qe]

(;B[ph]C[Olaf: Dont hang on these three little stones. Here you should be happy to throw them away for a big and secure corner.]

;W[lf];B[mf];W[pe];B[li]C[Olaf: now that the dust has settled, lets try to count a bit. :-)
Black has secure territory on the top (8 points), on the bottom (24 points) and a living group in the center (6 points) 38 points at all.
White has 6 points on the right, 8 points on the lower left and thats all. That white has some weak groups on the right and in the upper part on the board. These groups can give some additional poins, but if black can attack them, black gets additional points too.
There is only one black group, that is not secure. The group around C9. White should now attack these group in order to strengthen the white weak ones.]
;W[rp]C[Olaf: as said one move before, white should play on the left.]

;B[io];W[ho];B[ko];W[hp];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[go];B[jo]C[Olaf: now, what is the result of the fight? The black territory is no untouchable and worth 21 points (3 points less than my last count in move 89. The white group to the right is a little bit more secure, but still not allive (if white leaves it for now). So the whole fight was for about 3 points.]
;W[lm];B[bf]C[Olaf: this hits the vital point. Now black is clearly in the lead. The only thing which is a little bit unsecure is the center now. As white has strengthened themselve here, black is a little bit weak here.]

(;B[mi]LB[nh:A][ni:B]C[I played this so as to not give up the eye at A, but maybe whould have been better.
Olaf: Yes, play at B and all will turn to be OK. :-)];W[nj]

;W[oj];B[oi];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml]C[Olaf: what was about 12 points before, now becomes 36 points now.]
;B[lk];W[mm];B[km]C[This move seemed too small after I made it. I feel now that I should have played in the center before w did. But where exactly?
Olaf: Now the game is in whites favor (in terms of territory he leads by about 6 points). But it is still close. The game comes to the yose, so you should look for the biggest endgame moves now.]
