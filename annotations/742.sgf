RE[W+Resign]

C[Hello and thanks for reviewing this game. I used to play on IGS and reached 12k* there, then stopped playing for various reasons. This is my first game (played on Yahoo) after more than a year of inactivity, and as you will see I'm more like 21k in strength now. ;) I play white here.

The reason I submit this otherwise silly game full of blunders is that it also has some strategic problems I remember I also faced when I was a regular player.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc]LB[cf:A][df:B][hc:C]C[Usual response are A or B.

C is not popular in this situation.]

;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]LB[fd:A][eg:B]
[df:C][bh:D]C[There are four intersting points in this position.

A is the proper move BUT white is then overconcentrated so this way of playing is too slow. That's why the pincer is not popular.

D is an important tesuji worth knowing to make position on the left side. But know, it's not possible because o the weak group so white must play A first then think of D.

B & C are staightforward way to attenuate the aji of black F17 stone in sente BUT it's not so good because doing so loose the possibility of a play at D.]

(;W[nc]C[At this point I felt comfortable, probably another move near the UL corner would be better?

O17 is not so good because all you have 8 stones on only one side and you live all the rest to black.
Better to play R6

Mibe you think U17 somewhat protect you against the bad aji of F17 but it's not so.]
;B[eg];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[fh]C[F13 is better. With F12 you leave bas aji behind.]
;B[gg]C[No good. F13 shoul be possible in the future.]
(;W[gh]TR[dg][df][de][dd][dc][ec][eb]C[I felt so strong here I thought I can afford this move. Should capture and connect instead?

This move is bad : you play contact with o weak stone (G13) allowing him to flee more easily. Moreover, triangle group is unsecure.]
;B[ff];W[kd]TR[dg][df][de][dd][dc][ec][eb]MA[eh][fh][gh][fc]
CR[eg][ff][gg]C[Another tempting but questionable move?

LOSING MOVE  There is a fght we can qualifie as close-combat. There are FOUR weak groups in the area.
Whoever play fist wins the game.
L16 is just a dull move with a normal value(say 10 point)
In a combat, each move is worth al least 20 points, with no upper-limit.
It is your GREAT DEFAULT.

Maibe you think : "L16 take points AND it SOMEWHAT help the fight because it's near"
But it's not so.
FIRST : SAVE YOUR WEAK GROUPS or ATTACK ENNEMIES WEAK GROUPS
SECOND : TAKE POINTS
not the other order.];B[hg];W[hh];B[he];W[ig];B[if];W[jf];B[je]
;W[kf]C[This slow and useless walking/pushing is typical in this game, better connect at F18 and accept the outside separated?

No problem with this move. Black can capture your group and it's no small loss BUT
1) Your make fine influence
2) To suffer a cut is untolerable];B[fb];W[ea];B[fd];W[ge]C[The D15 group is dead now, right? I don't this this move works at all.

Anyway, even if I have connection, this was an area where I felt much stronger, and managed to get less than nothing here. I think something (or a lot of things) was terribly wrong.
Yes D15 group is dead but this move allow you to ptotect against a cut at J12 in sente]

(;W[lg]C[Another move I need advice at. I wanted to protect the cut and strengten the connection between G12 and the UR, but this move cannot accomplish these, right?
This move desn't work, see var dor tesusi];B[kh]C[The usual way to escape. But seems too early for me.]
;W[ki]C[Good direction : you push FROM your weak group TO your thickess.
So far, so good.];B[lh]
(;W[mh]C[NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Don't change your mind in the middle of the fight.
When you begins to push you CANNOT stop.];B[li]TR[ki][mh]MA[lh]
[li]C[this shape is alway bad. You must never let black traverse you two triangle stones like that.]

(;W[pn]C[I thought this will be a running game, and wanted to establish myself at some important points on the sides. What would be the correct moves and strategy here?

TERRIBLE : it's the secong time you do the same mistake.
You take 10 miserable points in the corner and loose 20 points letting black weak group becomes strong in one move.]
;B[kj]C[OUTCH !
How painfull. That hurts.];W[ji]C[Felt slow, but I didn't want to allow B to capture and get strong.]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[jj]C[painfull];W[ij];B[ik]C[painfull];W[hj]C[Again this group felt so strong I probably left it too long. Although black has several cutting points, maybe it was a mistake to let him turn under here at all?

YES : To let your opponent turn on you is always bad.];B[hk]

(;W[ek]C[I don't understand why didn't I play a single jump in this game. :) But jumping here would feel like letting black take all the left side, and staying in a nasty position between 2 black groups. On the other hand, this feels slow.

When and how should W enter the left side and the bottom? I'm really confused here. Maybe just play near C7 now, and hope for the connection?

ANSWER :There is little difference between E9 and F7. But playing C7 would have been fatal.

;B[oh];W[cl]C[I thought this is the last chance to save this group, and left the UR. But again I felt even if I live, the game is lost.

Looking at it now, maybe W can press and probably kill the O11 group? But with the big group in danger and short of liberties, and P10 and K5 in a questionable state, I'm totally confused.

You are right, even if you live you have lost. The only hope is that black try to kill you ans finish loosing his corner like in the var abive.]
;B[mf]C[ok black is not an idiot, he just don't try to kill.
You can abandon now.];W[nf];B[lf];W[me];B[kg];W[ng]C[This doesn't worth it, right?

yes, the lower right is more important.];B[cn];W[bk];B[bm];W[bl]

R15 is fine. Th corner is weak, you don't want ti fight just for life.]

Provided W tries to save this group, what is the best sequence? I guess not this slow and uncreative pushing. In my active days I understood I need some sacrifice stones at some places to create aji for later fighting, but almost never found the proper time and place for them. :(

White should die here.
BUT you can make furikawari : exchange your dead group for the corner]

G13 is a bad move because F13 is so good.
You cleanly take the stone destroying all aji in the process. What did black gain in exchange : just a weak stone with only 3 liberties and no meaning.

Black loose many possibilities in that exchange :
-- to play F13 (impossible now but in the future...)
-- to play E11 or F11 in sente.

Beginners always make that kind of bad moves just because the opponent MUST answer.
They think it's kikashi but it's not, it's aji-keshi (destroying of aji)]
