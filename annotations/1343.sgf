C[Dear reviewer
I played Black in this game, and I lost.
My big troubles are:
- Attacks
- Cutting points
Thank you

Hello,
my name is Peter Strempel. I am glad to review your game and will try to point you to your problems.
I play somewhat around 8k in germany, 11k on IGS.
If you have questions or comments, feel free to contact me on IGS ("Zotan" there) or via email at zotan@web.de.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[op];W[dd];B[jd]LB[co:A][do:B][qp:C]C[K16 is certainly not bad by itself, but generally it is better to approach the white 4-3 corner before white
gets the shimari (corner enclosure). So instead I would approach the corner at A or B here, or enclosure
your own corner with C, aiming at the extension at Q10 to setup a large framework.]
;W[co]LB[iq:A][jp:C][jq:B]C[You really would not want to allow white this move. You missed your approach move here in the last move and
White instantly gets this.
Please also note that P4, which is high and aims at influence towards the bottom is now getting somewhat less
efficient because of the strong lower left white corner.

A very big point next for both sides is around A-C, which is both an extension to each players corner and
limiting the extension of the other player. If White gets to play one of those points, the high position
of P4 is being nullified.];B[qf]LB[iq:A][qp:B]C[I would play A or B instead.

A was explained in the last move, to get this extension from P4 and limit whites extension from the
corner at the same time, or B to enclose your own corner.

Please note that your upper left corner is *not* yet secure. A 4-4 stone requires 2 stones for an
enclosure, so B would be more urgent here.];W[jq]C[White is playing the big point. Now you allowed white to get two big moves in a row missing
to get them yourself.
P4 is looking worse now. When White invades the corner at R4, you wont get a good result
anymore as P4, aiming towards the bottom, is neutralized by the strong white position already.]

(;B[pj]LB[cf:A][fc:B][qp:C]C[I would approach the upper left corner with A or B instead, or enclose the lower right with C now
and aim at playing Q10 afterwards.
Note that white can invade at C now, and should play that very soon.]
;W[dj]C[White should probably invade at R4 instead. If black may play R4, Black would get a good position with the
P4, R4, Q10 formation.

D10 is certainly not bad, it gives white the double-wing formation after a corner enclosure, which is a
very strong shape (usually K3 would be high at K4).]
(;B[gd]LB[fc:B][qp:A]C[R4 !!!

If white invades at R4 now, your framework is quickly ripped apart.

If you play a high corner opening like 5-4, this does not mean you should *never* play the
followup enclosing move. Especially if you do play an enclosing move for a 4-4 corner (R14),
which in fact is not an enclosure (P17 missing still) while ignoring the R4 enclosure, this does
not make too much sense.

Instead G16, rather play the approach move at F17 (B), white would maybe not ignore it, so
you can play R4. However, White probably would ignore F17 and invade at R4 instantly.
You are missing to play R4 much too long.

G16 is lukewarm. White can ignore it. It neither attacks white nor makes territory for you.]
;W[qp]C[Yes. This move hurts you severly. Note how you cannot put P4 to optimal use now with the
bottom already conquered by strong white forces.];B[pn]C[This move aims for influence. However, white is strong on the bottom, so your influence
is already neutralized.]
(;W[rn]
(;B[ec]C[Bad move.

Two reasons:
1) It "forces" white to block at D17 and get a huge corner. A "Thank you" move. White says thank you for
being "forced" to play D17, as White would had loved to play D17 anyways.
2) You should punish white in the lower right corner for playing elsewhere. See variation.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[de]TR[ec][ed][gd][jd]C[It should be obvious white gets the better deal out of this sequence.

The black stones are too close together and overconcentrated.]
;B[db];W[cb]
(;B[da]C[Bad!

Connect solid at E18 instead. Then you later have a good endgame move.
This way white descents to C19, you lose your endgame move, and you end up in gote as well.
This is a common beginner mistake, and you should get used not to play these moves. The first
line descent is usually only played when you need to make 2 eyes quickly, and this is not the
case here.];W[ca];B[eb];W[cc]C[Not necassary to protect here. There is a ladder if black cuts.]

(;B[lp]LB[eo:B][oc:A][qq:C]C[This move is lukewarm. It does nothing. It does not protect your stones, makes no territory for yourself
and does not attack white.

Instead either enclose the upper right corner at P17, carefully attack the strong lower left white position
or attack white in the lower right corner. Latter was shown in an earler variation.]
;W[jo]C[Yes, your move induced this (good) white move. Invading the lower side is now getting more difficult for
you. So your M4 didnt do yourself anything good but only helped white to strengthen himself.]
;B[kn];W[jn];B[km];W[ql]C[This hurts. In the last 2 moves White got the better deal, as your invasion in the bottom is now very difficult,
while your own side is still very open.];B[pl];W[qk];B[qj]C[Tough. After white pushes at Q9 you leave behind a lot of cutting points.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[pk];B[ok];W[il];B[kl]C[K9 instead should do.]

(;W[of]C[Your group on the lower right is small, very vulnerable and has cutting points. White bottom left is very
strong. White lower right corner is now alive. This did not go well at all. Why this happened I explained before.]

(;B[nh]LB[oc:A][oh:B]C[You should enclose your corner or defend the cutting point at P10. O12 does not do that.]
;W[od]
(;B[nd]C[O16 is attaching a white stone which is (still) weak. By attaching a stone you will only help it to
get stronger. So your "attack" here only helps white. This is probably not your intention.]
;W[oc];B[oe]C[Dangerous cut.];W[ne];B[pe];W[md];B[nc];W[nb]
;B[mc];W[lc]
(;B[kc];W[lb];B[le]C[You cannot attack white anymore. Your move on the pivot is an attacking move. However, this white group
is alive now.];W[mb];B[pb];W[mf];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[pg];B[ph]
;W[me];B[qg];W[ng];B[lf];W[ld];B[ke];W[kb];B[jb]C[Ok, so you walled white in. But white destroyed all your framework now. This is usually no problem as
you get something in return and can then destroy your opponents framework. However, the walls towards
the center you got here are quite useless to attack the lower left side. Your M4 etc. moves helped white
to build the nice wall on the K line while you got nothing in return.]
;W[ee]
(;B[ff]C[F15 instead is better.

You need to do something about the bottom. This will be very difficult. But to keep a chance in this
game - it actually already is lost - you must destroy a large amount of white territory, and white
has a LOT on the bottom left and a good chance to build on the left side.]
;W[ef];B[gf];W[eg];B[fh];W[ei]C[Again! You just help white to turn a large junk of space into secure territory while you get not
an equal amount of profit yourself.

The space white gets on the left is larger than what you get between the G and K/L/M line. So if your
moves benefit the opponent more, then do not play them!

Also you now can forget about a reducing move against the left side.]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[gh];W[ij];B[jj];W[ii];B[ih];W[gj];B[ji];W[ik]

Your opening was not very good. But openening theory is extremely complex, and I am certainly
not strong enough to give good advice for this. But I tried to point out why white managed to
get ahead early in the game. Your opening moves were pretty inconsistent. Basically, approach
the enemy, play extensions from your stones which at the same time limit extensions of your
opponent, try to make your stones work well together and aim at playing moves your opponent
will not ignore.

Later in the game you failed to invade and/or reduce the lower left and the left side, leaving
white a large junk of points. But worse, when looking on how white gained the large territory,
one has to note that you just helped white to take it! This is something you definately need
to change. When moves benefit your opponent more than yourself, then do NOT play them!
I have given a couple of examples in the game when you played such moves.
I know this is a complex topic when deciding when a move should rather not be played although
it looks thrilling. I wish I would be able to apply this in my own games. :)

Also later in the game you left too many cutting points around without protecting them.
Actually, worse is to create cutting points, although you can not always prevent it. If you must
protect the cut, you need to waste a move, so try not to create such cutting points. However,
this requires some reading ahead and is certainly no easy task.

When you attacked the white invasion in the upper right, you played attaching moves which
only helped white to get stronger. When you attack, play from some distance while making
some strong group and/or territory yourself. Fending off an invasion while getting profit
is a good tactic. You usually dont need to kill the invader. In this game you managed
to get a nice corner, which was good. But if you had attacked white more severly, you could have
gotten a bit more probably.

I think what you need to concentrate most on for now is to learn to not play moves which
appear to be forcing your opponent to answer on first glance, but on second glance they
actually help your opponent while you get nothing or much less in return. Those moves
are often played by beginners because the opponent will answer them. But he answers them
not because you threaten something horrible, but because his answering move is a move he
wanted to play anyways. You need to differ between forcing moves (moves that actually
threaten something) and "thank-you" moves (moves your opponent answers with pleasure).
Playing the latter is just like giving your opponent points for free and thinking this was
good because you forced him to take them.

If you have questions and comments left, feel free to contact me and ask. I hope I could
assist you a little with this review.])

(;B[fi]C[Instead you should try to reduce the opponents framework from above, when an invasion is too risky.
If an invasion fails, the group is dead and the opponent got territory AND strength towards the center, so
it is a difficult decision in such a position. A reducing move is less efficient than an invasion, but will
usually not be in danger.

However, you are so far behind in the game now, if you dont invade, you have lost. If you invade and are killed,
you lose too. But that is not much of a change to the other option. Reducing might not be enough in this
position now.]))
