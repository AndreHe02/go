AB[pd][dp]C[Hello Michaela,
you are as strong as I am, so i do not have very much remarks for you
I think w 53 is a big mistake (and maybe you lost the game here).

bye
Pieter


Hello,

this was a 2 stone handigame against a 1kyu (kgs).
I had white and lost 3.5 points.

Best regards

In this attack, b can lose this centre moyo and so the game.
That's the reason i think that  D3 (square) was wrong direction.]

-> better to protect the top corner and attack the triagle indirectly

It looks as if b can kill this group...
The triangle is the urgent point:
 - it saves your group
 - it takes territory];B[hc]C[good !];W[ic]
