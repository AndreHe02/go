C[Hi there and thanks in advance for your review,

this is the first game I submit. I noticed that you have only a few 9x9 games on GTL. I especially like the "small boards" reviews, because you can read them first and they are not as complex as the big boards. Nice for beginners.

Nevertheless I found this game I played yesterday very exciting and hope that you are going to review it. I played black, the opponent is somewhere between 15 kyu and 10 kyu.


jlim:  Hi, I will be reviewing this game.  At time of writing, I am currently 10k on KGS.  Please feel free to ask stronger players for a second opinon ^^.  FYI, my experience with 9x9 games is rather limited to igowin, where my average level is a 6k.]

(;W[bc]C[snakebite: This move is really bugging me. Is B7 really necessary? A5 should have been fine for a win for white; A4 would be even better. (see var.)

I can't shake the feeling that white let me win intentionally...


jlim:  this move is easy to ensure white is alive in the corner.  white would need to protect in gote if white made the descent to A5 anyways.  A4 would actually be worse as it would setup a ko, or lead to the same situation as in A5.  See variations for a better explanation.]

For reference, see J-Groups, L-Groups, and Bent Four in the Corner.  

I hope the reader learned something from this as well!])

(;W[bd]C[jlim:  Even if W wins the ko at A5, W needs one more move to protect the corner.  If B wins the ko at A5, W should have simply descended to A5 in the first place.  In short, there is no need for W to start this ko.]

(;B[ab];W[bb];B[af]C[jlim:  If White responds at A5, Black can kill White with a "bent four in the corner."  If White wants to live, White should play A7.]

(;W[ae];B[ac];W[bd];B[aa];W[tt]C[jlim:  Note that this is not a seki - Black can first go around the board removing all ko threats before playing B9 to obtain  a bent four in the corner, and White is dead.]

(;B[ca]C[jlim:  Black can actually kill the corner as it stands with the hane.  This would more than compensate for White's move at H6, and would probably force White to resign.  I have listed the top branch as the one with the strongest moves for both sides, and gone in some depth into the other variations.  

It would be good practice to try and verify that white is indeed dead.  If you don't fully understand why each of the moves are made, don't worry about it too much as this is a more difficult problem.]
