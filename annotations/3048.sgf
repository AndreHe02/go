C[This is a game game that I (Kim, aka phantom) started playing on DGS (a turned based go server) about a month ago.  I just finished about two weeks ago and have been wanting to have it reviewed ever since, so I'm submitting to the GTL for comments.

There's no specific part of the game that I want comments on, but I'll try to go through and make comments on what I was thinking before submitting it.

Thanks in advance to the nice person who's going to review this for me!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[po]C[Black's move at Q5 made me rather uncomfortable.  I'm not used to dealing with stones at the 5-4 point.  In the end it would have given b a pretty big corner if I hadn't pulled off a 3-3 invasion.  So, if you have any comments on how I dealt with this stone at any point in this game, I'd like to hear them.

The Q5 stone is not such a big deal. One thing that really hurt you is that you never got any good use out of your d16 stone. 4-4 point stones are good for attacking or building moyos, and you never really worked on either of these. Extensions along the upper or left sides could have helped this stone tremendously towards the beginning of the game while making black's groups uncomfortable in the upper right and lower left.

You also had a tendency to play mostly useless extensions from your strong groups. Moves 16, 28, 30, 82, and 140 are examples of this. None of these surrounded much territory or weakened enemy groups. Most of them appear to be defensive moves, but none of them were necessary defenses.

I really liked your lower right invasion. Excellent job there.]

;W[qj];B[qm];W[pl]C[This move is not necessary because the r14 group is already strong. You should be looking for opportunities to collect more points on the upper or left side. J17, c10, c4, c17 are a few possibilities that come to mind.]
;B[cf];W[gd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce]
;B[fb];W[ic]C[This move isn't very useful. If you wanted to play a stone in this area, m17 would be okay to attack the upper right corner. Then if black defends you can follow up with j17 for territory.

You also have a wall stretching from b15 to g16. This gives you the strength to play an invasion around c10, also a good move I think.]
;B[ch];W[ld]C[Just one spot away, m17 would have given you some immediate territory and would do more to attack the upper right corner. As it is black can still play m18 to take territory and stabilize the corner group. The only value I see in this move is that it increases the size of your wall (b15 to m16) which is only significant if you eventually find a use for that huge wall. This never happens.]
;B[kq];W[bp];B[bn];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[kr];W[fn]C[This move is alright. Some thing in the top center is probably worth more though.]
;B[gh];W[eh];B[jj]C[I think I ended up letting b do far too much in the middle of the board as the game progressed.  I wonder when and how I should have done more to threaten the group that b ended up with in the middle in order to either reduce it or kill it.

By this point it's too late to do very much with the middle. All center stones, black and white, can easily reach safety. g12 was a pretty good move in terms of destroying white's options in the center.]

;W[ae]C[In this area, B13 or A14 are worth more points. On the board as a whole, I would probably go with n18 or r8, which get more points and also threaten invasions.]
;B[af];W[mb];B[nb];W[re]C[Were moves like this one less than urgent and is this where I should have been worrying more about those black stones in the middle?

This move isn't too bad. I prefer n17, g18, s8, c5, or even an invasion in the lower right corner. Not sure if that last option would work.]
;B[rd];W[rf];B[mc];W[lc];B[jg];W[og]C[This move is very small. M18 is good here. In addition to getting some immediate points (saving the stone) you create a sente play at o19 for later. Invasion also seems possible in that case.]
;B[oi];W[nk];B[lj];W[ql];B[hb];W[qq]C[I think that this stone ended up working well for me.  But, was there a better place I could have started in order to do just a bit more damage?  Or was there any point in the entire sequence where things could have gone differently?

You handled this invasion very well.];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[qr]

C[h7 defends more territory. It is a weaker shape, but I don't think it would be a problem.]

;B[hl];W[dm]C[I don't think this defense is necessary. Better to get more points with t16.]
