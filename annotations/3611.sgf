C[Hello Reviewer, thanks for reviewing my game.

In this game I felt like I gained a strong lead only to lose it in the end. Somehow the White player managed to heavily reduce my territory. Advice as to how I might have avoided this would be welcome.
----
*Hello Dave, I am Thomas Derz, 3d (Eur) and I enjoy commenting on your game. To relativate the value of my comments that my weaknesses are Joseki and Fuseki (and endgame). 
I am not bad in shape and middle game. 

My comments will be usually marked and start with an asterix *.
I will call White "she" and indicate white moves and stones with "her".

I would not only like to comment on where you might have lost this game, but on black and white moves & concepts in general. To assign a single move or sequence as the losing one is usualy not the full picture, we all play a mix of weak, good and excellent moves. However, sometimes it might be, that we play the proper tactical sequence for a   less than good purpose - or inversely have the correct game evaluation and a good next aim in mind, but tactics are not adequate. Hence, I'll see what I can find to comment on.

Hence, I will try to follow these guidelines for Reviewing:
<http://senseis.xmp.net/?GuideToReviewing>

Because the Senseis website is very useful, I add some references to it (I am sure that they will also exist in the future).

I use SmartGoPlayer 1.1.2 from Anders Kierulf for editing my commentary. It works very nicely.

Please follow the variations of which I entered many. If you use an SGF-FF4 compatible reader there should be no problems of viewing all the variations and comments.\]

Summary of concepts, mistakes and good decisions:
B11: wrong shape + idea of how to attack
Yilun Yang's book "Fundamental Principles of Go" would be a great help for you. (http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo)

B15: shape mistake in Joseki leaves 2 cutting points
B23: pushing battle for influence
B35: keep cutting aji in reserve
B45, 53, 55: do not push on the 6th line
B51: do not establish another group
B59: appreciate the "hane-at-the-head-of-two"-proverb
B67 makes Black heavy in gote
B87 a big move enabling a monkey jump, but exist bigger moves?
B123ff: B could have punished White's aggressive contact attacks, but made a 3rd eye for an already safe group.
B125 fails to separate White
W132 sets up a ladder - but ladder does not work
B133: know ladders
B151-153: know getas
B152 good mental approach, stirr up trouble when behind!
W152 W could have chosen another geta
W158 & W162 W could play safer
W170: fails to capture the pivotal cutting stones B69 ff.
W180 misses the vital point for a sure life
B181 too misses this point
B185 another vital point could lead to ko
W186: your proposal, improve essential, simple reading ability

Dave, my advice for you is to improve your shape and basic moves in Life & Death.
You could do that by reading books like "Tesuji" from Davies or Fujisawa Shuko, TsumeGo and "Fundamental Principles of Go" by Yilun Yang.

I wish you much success and improvement in your Go career!]
;B[qp];W[dq];B[pd];W[oq];B[op]C[*Black could play this attach-&-extend (tsuke-nobi) variation when there were black stones on the right side (not counting the upper right hoshi).

The attach-&-extend-technique always leads to strong reinforcement of both parties involved.
If it is played in a handicap game (hence with a 4-4-stone, where Black perhaps got the idea from to play it) there is often such a helping stone on the right side (e.g. Q10).

Here, there is no such stone on the right side,
hence I think, that the disadvantage of reinforcing White is not outweighed by own advantages (e.g. building a moyo or so), after all the right side is still open.

Now what could Black have done? (instead of B5)

Yilun Yang's book "Fundamental Principles of Go" would be a great help for you. (http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo):

- Occupying a free corner is always of great value (upper left)
(the next differentiation is how: 4-4, 3-4, which one, 5-3 etc)
- playing a kakari (e.g. lower left)
- playing a pincer e.g. vs. W4];W[np];B[oo];W[pq];B[qq];W[ce]
LB[kq:X]C[*White should , and usually would end the sequence by protecting at X.

That she did not, does not mean that Black has to attack this group directly with the next move.

Often it is more effective to wait for the most valuable time to attack there.
If white gets the chance to defend the 3 stones, Black still gets his rightfull sente.

My message is here: 
you do not lose anything if you do not attack immediatly !
Take your time ! Be patient.
White's weaknesses might materialize for you later.]
(;B[mq]MA[lp]C[*This move is very bad!

It forces White to connect, but B11 has no good continuation, because black's shape of B11 is very bad.

B11 only has 3 liberties after the immediate white connection and 
is more a help to White's position than a threat.

This B11 is a premature attacking move and only strengthens white.

If Black wanted to attack now - he doesn't have to IMO - than the attacking shape move is X.

There is a joking proverb "Cut first - think later"];W[nq]C[*By this exchange,
 White gained a lot:

The cutting point is connected,
B11 is weak himself.]
(;B[dc]CR[ed][ce][ih][lm][np][dq]C[The next white move presses Black down.

This shape mistake in Joseki leaves 2 cutting points
No matter whether the initial choice of B13 was good or bad,
now Black must go through (cf. Ishida vol. 2, p. 133, dia. 1).

W16 punishes immediately.

*No, it is not, please cf. with my remark on move B15.

B23: should push now at W24 and force White to take the stone,
thereby creating more black influence to the right side.
(there is not much lost black aji vs. the white position to consider)

On the contrary B23 is now low.

Pl. cf. http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushingBattlesInJoseki3];W[fd]
C[*W24: White immedeately seizes the chance to cross the line between possible moyos.

This is a good idea and keeps Black low on the top.]
(;B[do]C[*Despite the disadvantage on top, this is a good decision:

if Black was ending up in gote on top,
White would take a very valuable shimari here.];W[eo]MA[ce]
[ed][fd]LB[en:B][dp:C][cq:D]C[*Ishida: "The idea of W26 is not to fall behind in influence".

White knows that the right whight group is strong and plans to establish a moyo there.

A pincer from the top would have been equally good (IMO), 
because the X-marked stones can also form the bases of a moyo.

Therefore I would prefer to neutralize that a bit by a black hane at "B".
However the global position is already uneasy for black, 
as the bottom right and the top left corner were left disadvantageously.

Bumping into the position with "C" as in the game feels disadvantageous too, because Black will usually get sealed in.

If you want to pursue your idea, the san-san attachment "D" would lead to similar, complicated sequences (which I will not show here).
Pl. ref. to e.g. Ishida, vol. 2, p. 82, dia. 54 ff.]
(;B[dp];W[ep];B[cq];W[dn]C[This was a bit confusing to me on white's part. How should one continue?

* W30 is a "basic instinct" move called "hane at the head of two" and very valuable.

I added 2 joseki sequences, which you both could have reached in transposition.

The outcome would be that Black had diminuished white's influence on the right, but White had gotten a position on the left and vice versa.]

If black wanted to play in this direction,
simply and only jumping to B55-tobi (without B51)

it should not become all white territory,

As I elaborated before,
Black did not appreciate some fundamentals (which I referenced to in Senseis) and White immediately did.

However my assesment of territorial balance may have been off. That is, perhaps white areas were more secure than mine and white would have found some way to compromise my areas no matter how I played. I was, in fact, never ahead.

On these and other aspects of the game, I await your advice.

It is better to play black C (hane), White cuts at D,
Black connects at E and White would set up a working ladder with F.

Therefore, in order to prevent the ladder, Black better plays G,
hence White gets an atari H, Black connects at E,
White extends to I with the options of making sabaki at J
or jumping to K.
