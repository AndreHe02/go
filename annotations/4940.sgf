C[B: Hello Dear Reviewer!
I've preceded all my comments/questions with B:

My questions mainly concern the opening, living/dead groups and middle game strategy eg what to play after move 141.

Thanks in advance for the review and have fun.

Fr�d�ric


Hi,
I added some comments which I hope are helpful. W's getting life in the upper-left has to be accepted, but your loss on the bottom was very big and important.

Mark];B[dp]C[buitenland [13k\]: hi];W[pd];B[dd]C[buitenland [13k\]: good game]

;B[hd]TR[op][mq][oq]C[B: Is H16 a good move or would N3, P4 or P3 be better?

I am not sure, but I guess I like P4 best. All of these moves are good big moves. Of course, if you play one of the triangle moves, W has the option of doing the same so it is something of a miai.]
;W[jj];B[hj]TR[op][mq][oq]C[F: Would a side extension be better than H11?

Now I definitely like the the side extension. W's and B's moves are big, but  violate the corner, side, center order of play.]
;W[mc];B[oq]LB[mq:A][op:B]C[B:

You get a good point. W's last move should have been at say, A. I like B for you a little better, because W's next move works well with his stones above.]

I wonder if you shouldn't play A or even elsewhere now];W[fq]
;B[dq]TR[cn]C[B: C6 better?

The game move seems good to me. W has to try to make a small life.]
;W[hq];B[dm]TR[io][jn][jo]C[
Builds territory while threatening W. The triangle moves might also be good for the same reason.]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[cc]
(;B[dc]LB[cf:A]C[B: Is this correct?
And what would be a good sequence starting from here?

I think that the game sequence  is good from here. I might have played the move here instead of  A.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[cd];W[bd];B[bf];W[ba]LB[da:A]
[ab:B]C[B: Is White alive? (W seems alive)

Yes, B would have to play on both A and B to kill W]
(;B[jb]LB[ic:A]C[
This move and B's next move aren't good, especially together. B gives up too much. Here A is the point to think about. If B doesn't want to play at A, he has to realize that W might. Maybe B should just invade the right side. I notice that you make this diagonal 2 point jump several times in the game. It can work, but you need to read out the consequences of W playing in the middle.]

B has to be careful, but I think he should separate W with A.]

I don't think that this is needed. You need to think about the border between B and W territory. Moves like A-D are interesting. I don't know if an invasion like E or F is really going to work at this point.]

The game move and A are miai to connect. B needs something like B-C to reduce W's territory.]

[iq][jr][js][is][hs][np][nq][oq]LB[nn:A][lp:B]C[B: Can Black's bottom group live after M3?

No, If your cutting point at A was alive, you could kill W's stones by playing at B.]
;B[lr]TR[ji][pg][oi]C[B: If the Black group is indeed dead what would a good move for Black now?
Black needs more territiry to win this game, so he has to invade, but where?
I played K11 but had little profit with that move.
What about Q13?
Or P11?
...I'm lost here : )
I tried some varaitions at 141

The moves that you suggest are worth a try as a long shot, but given good play by both sides, B has no real chance to win at this point. The game is W's to lose if he is careless. B can try some invasions ans sacrifices to make the game confusing and hope that W makes a mistake.]

Here is one of those jumps. W plays on the key point. If you played at A, it would gain some points relative to the game move, but not enough to win the game.]

(;B[pg]C[B: Is this a possible variation?

I think that this a good chance for what I call "flailing around wildly" and that is what you need to do when you are behind. The chances aren't good, but something like this is the only chance you have. I extended the variation, by a few moves to show a possible cut by W, but it is hard to say how the actual game would have gone.]
