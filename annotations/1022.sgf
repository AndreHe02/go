C[Here o10 becomes a very critical point.  Since it is your move is it imperative that you play it.  Following will be two variations that show the difference between white and black playing it.  For white the size of moyo in the lower right is drastically different depending on who gets O10.]

(;W[gd]C[Your aim here should be to connect the two groups.  Connection will make them better able to handle the attacks of black and eventually you'll be able to attack the P12 group and C12.]
;B[he]
(;W[hf]C[All your stones around here are physically disconnected from each other.  This makes them weak in close combat.  You shouldn't add further weak stones to the fight.]
;B[ge]C[Black has the rigth idea in adding a stone to the one being attacked.]
;W[fd];B[gf];W[eg];B[gh];W[ei];B[ck];W[ek];B[fh];W[eh];B[dj]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[ic];B[jc];W[ie];B[id]C[Disconnect his groups.  H16 is definately a good cut.  J17 is not important enough for you to allow black to connect.]

(;W[hc];B[hd]C[now both your group are sturggling to live and blacks group in between is quite strong.  Saving J17 cost you quite a bit.]
;W[hg];B[ff];W[ef];B[mg];W[mf];B[og]C[This peep is quite a serious threat.  Allowing black to connect through P14 and take the territory in that area is a massive loss of points.  Keep the pressure on black by connecting.]
;W[dm];B[eo]C[This may or may not be nesecary for black.  It would have to be balanced against P14's importance.]

(;W[go]C[Mistake, see variation.]
(;B[ej]C[This move is definately less important than P14.];W[fj]
;B[fi];W[gj];B[hh];W[ih];B[ii];W[jh];B[fp];W[fq];B[dp]C[Black would do better to push out at G4.]
;W[gp];B[eq];W[gm];B[lq];W[np];B[of]C[There finally black sees P14 and takes it.  Now whites center group is in grave danger while blacks group surrounding it are all living and strong.]

(;W[nm]C[White misses the fact the center group easily die.  The error is compounded by playing an unnnessecary stone.  O10 does better at holding this area for white.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[lo];W[lm];B[mk]C[Black should pick a direction to attack the white enclosure.  Either try to make his group live inside it or press in from outside to shrink it, not both.]
;W[nk]C[White should take the opportunity to attack blacks group on the lower side at K3.]
;B[nj];W[ok];B[kk];W[jm];B[kl];W[ml]C[Why?  Block the peep and stay strong to try and kill blacks group on the lower side.]
;B[km];W[lk]C[Allowing black to connect at L6 will make it difficult to kill his group.  Grabbing the stone at N9 is not adequate pay off to allow black that connection.]
;B[lj]C[N9 is not important enough for black to forgo connecting at L6]

;W[qi];B[pi];W[pj];B[rh];W[bm];B[pq];W[qq];B[op]C[Black will get points if he connects his groups.  Letting him losing white quite a lot.]

(;W[oo]C[this allows connection and makes black strong in what could have been white territory.]
;B[nq];W[pp];B[oq];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[kp]C[When making a connection play one that the opponent can't use against you again.]

(;W[ip]C[This allows black an easy connection and generates points for black as well.]

;W[rn];B[qn]C[White loses this game allowing black make connections when white had easy ways to prevent them.  Thus all blacks groups become strong and whites being disconnected from each other become weak and in the end two large groups die.  White would do well to study good/bad shape and how to connect/cut.  Please forward any questions to salvor7@yahoo.com]
