C[Hello reviewer.  I am Mark Fyffe, and I play black in this game.  This game is typical for me lately:  it feels to me that I am in control of the action, but unable to think through a decent enough plan to carry the entire game so end up at a 10-20 points loss.  In fact, this is the fourth game this week that ran pretty much this way.  I'd appreciate any advice in weighing the areas of the board and making some of the more difficult decisions throughout this game.  Thanks in advance for your time! ;-)]

(;B[qm]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[reid: Hello Mark.

Here black missed his first opportunity for an easy game.  Up to Black 9 (K4) there are no mistakes, but white 10 (Q5) is a problem when black has a stone at K4.  See the variation - it's a good sequence to remember because it seems to come up a lot at the "close to shodan" level..

White should play A or B instead of a one-space approach.];W[qq]
C[bucky: I am not so sure that I play this joseki quite right.  Although the high approach seems not uncommon, I have a lot more practice responding to the low approach here.

reid: As you can see from the previous variation, the high approach should *not* be common in this position.  And the stone at K4 makes all the difference in any discussion here.]
;B[pp]LB[qp:A][qr:B]C[reid: Hmm, I don't think I've ever seen this.  Black's choices are A, B, and perhaps tenuki.  A is the most common, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason to tenuki.  B is low and lets white get light shape by jumping out.

The josekis that continue with black A are worth learning (white cuts at Q4 and black extends to R5).

But as my teacher likes to say "this is all impossible" because black should have played Q8 instead of R7.]
;W[qp];B[oo];W[pn]C[reid: This is terrible for black.  White comes squirting out between the two black positions like  water squirting out of a hose!  A splitting attack is most effective when the positions being split are as close together as possible.]
;B[qr]C[reid: Can black do this?  What if white cuts at A?  See variation.  Probably Q2 is the honest move.]

(;W[qn]LB[rn:B][qo:C][ro:A]C[reid: Urk!  Terrible shape for white!  You must banish this kind of move from your library if you want to get stronger.  A or B is a better way to protect the cut.  Even connecting at C is better!

But the worst problem here is that this move indicates white is afraid to be cut.  Fear is your worst enemy and your opponent's best friend!]
;B[pr]C[reid: If black had played Q2 instead of R2, and white had still played at R6, whould black want to play R2 now?]
;W[pm]C[reid: Now we can see just how bad R6 is.  See variation.]

(;B[ce];W[fd];B[dj]LB[bc:C][ch:A][ci:B][em:D]C[reid:  What is black trying to do with this move?

If black wants to defend his C15 stone, he needs to play at A, B or C.  If he wants to grow his bottom side moyo, he needs D.  D10 is halfway between these two which puts it strategically nowhere.

D10 is a moyo-making move.  But white F16 and Q7 make it impossible to build a moyo in the center, and C6 undercuts any left-side territory.]
;W[kp]LB[nc:A][qf:B]C[reid: This is not a very reasonable invasion for white.  It is too deep and too early.  White has lots of other points that are bigger (like A or B).]
;B[kq]LB[ko:A]C[However, black answered so that white can continue.  Black should be more aggressive here.  After all, the Q3 group can always find life with the hane at S3, so they're nearly as good as alive already.  I would hane on top with A and try to make the C10 stone into a good move.]
;W[jq];B[lq];W[ip];B[jo];W[io];B[iq]C[bucky: K2 better, or it is also easily cut?

reid: K2, encouraging white to connect and get stronger, is not good.]
;W[hq];B[ir]C[reid: Bad mistake here!  Black should take the K3 stone off the board.  Now H2 is sente for white so he can connect at F2.]
;W[hr];B[jr];W[go]C[reid: As long as white has the fallback of connecting at F2, he has no threat against the H3 stones.  This is not a fair fight.]
;B[gr];W[hs]C[reid: white can still connect at F2.];B[em]LB[en:A]
C[reid: Black leaves behind a big cut at white A.  About 20 points that white can pluck any time.]
;W[in]LB[dl:A][en:B]C[reid: This move has no affect on black.  The K5 group is too strong, and the proverb says "play away from strength".

If I were white, I't find it hard to resist A, but maybe taking the cut at B is good enough.]
;B[jd]LB[co:B][do:A][er:C]C[reid:  OK Mark, this may be an indicator of why you're struggling.  To my mind, the situation on the left side is screaming for resolution - there's a scattering of black stones that could be attacked in several different ways.  But instead of trying to settle the situation there, you've grabbed the big point of K16.

Remember the proverb that says "play the urgent point, not the big point".

What's urgent?  That's not as hard as it might seem: life and death is urgent.  The black stones on the left are far from alive.

K16 is the kind of move you make when all the other situations on the board are stable (or when you think you're so far ahead you can just play easy moves).

Here's the sequence I would aim at: start with black A to get a solid connection.  If white answers (probably at B), then black C is a huge territorial move that also splits the weak white stones from their safety.  After that fight settles down, maybe it'll be time for K16.  Or maybe something else will be called for.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[reid: Black Q14 naturally helps white to build  in a direction that will help white make a large territory (Q13).  You should try to avoid helping your opponent (assuming you want to win, of course).]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qj]LB[nc:A]TR[qf]C[bucky: Am I too nice to white on the right side?  I want enough influence to make white's dragon difficult, but looking at the right side now, I am not sure that this was the best choice.

Reid:  So how much did black gain compared to just answering  the triangled stone with A?  Maybe 5 to 7 points?  But white has gained nearly 20 points on the side.  I'd say you are very nice :-)]
;B[og]C[reid: more help.];W[ph];B[km];W[nc]C[bucky: works for white?  how should I respond to this stone?

Well, black didn't complete the joseki, so of course white can do something here.

L7 is too small anyway - black can't attack the H3 stones because E4 is too weak, and there is no territory to the right of L7 because of Q7.

I am going to end my commentary here.  You have a couple of questions later, but I'd say the significant issues you need to work on have already been dealt with.

Go is not a game of chance, at least it's not supposed to be.  If you play hoping that things will work out and that your opponent will make a mistake or not see a trick, you will not progress.  Your opponent is there to make your life as difficult as possible: you should assume he sees everything you do and then some.  Instead of hoping for future mistakes, you must deal with the mistakes that are already on the board.  Respect your opponent, but don't do anything to help him.

Real strength comes from seeing the true situation on the board and playing the move required by the current situation.  The person who sees more correctly will be the stronger player.]

;B[ff]C[bucky: the next 100 moves are so are a big fight over this dragon.  I see some misreads reviewing this battle, both by white and by black, but how to win without turning the whole left side into a bloodbath?  Also, when are some good opportunities to let go of the fight without sacrificing so much.]

C[When black has the triangled stone (or even one closer at L4, but not further at J4!) white cannot play a close approach to Q3 and expect a good result.  Black pincers with Q8 (instead of A), which limits white's choices considerably.  White can think about B, C, and D:

After B, black takes white's base with the hane at R2, etc and white will not be happy.  

If white C, black follows the joseki starting with F and his K4 stone ends up in just the right spot - again white is not happy.  (Note that E is never a real choice after black Q8: blakc F, white G, black H and the fighting will be good for black).

White's last choice is D which looks like it might be reasonable.  But if we continue:]
;W[no];B[nq];W[lo];B[lq]LB[pi:A]C[The standard joseki has white jumping twice with black taking slod third line territory on the bottom.  White will get compensation for that territory by attacking black with a move somewhere around A.

But now black M3 and K4 just look too slow!  Black missed a chance for a better sequence:]
;AB[mp]AE[lq]C[With K4 in place, black can peep at N4 instead of submitting at M3.  White must answer this, and then:]
;W[mo];B[qg]LB[qf:C][pj:A][qj:B]C[Now black gets to reinforce his R8 stone like this and a white invasion around A or B is nearly impossible (black will have one weak group between two weak white groups - an ideal splitting attack).

So white has given away territory on the bottom and he gets nothing in return - black has an easy game.

Note carefully that R13 is better than something like Q11 or R11: Black wants white to invade near A or B, not near the C (R14)!]
