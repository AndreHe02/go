RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[MM: Mike Malveaux "wegobad" making a GTL review, focused primarily for White, July 2006.]
;B[pd];W[cq]C[MM: Interesting move. I do not often see this.
Black declares an interest in influence by playing high, and White emphasizes territory with a 3-3, diagonally opposite Black's corner, which may mean less early fighting.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[nq]TR[nc][dd]C[MM: I am not sure, but my sense is that it would be better to develop from the D16 corner not the C3 corner.  So, perhaps O17 instead of O3.]
;B[qn];W[kq];B[dp];W[dq]TR[cp]C[MM: The L3-O3 stones should be able to care of themselves.  I think C4, reaching toward the side with more potential, would be better here.]
;B[cp];W[eq]C[is Hane at E4 better?

MM: This E3 looks slow, but I think it is better than the E4 hane.  The hane would just encourage Black to get stronger, I think.  This E3 is very safe, leaves no cutting points for Black to play with later.  If you get a stone at H3 or H4, then you have basically claimed the whole side.]
;B[qf]C[MM: This R14 looks wrong to me.  The two stones at C4 are not settled.  Right up against the strong Whites, these two Blacks badly need help.]
;W[ql]TR[ck][dk][cl][dl][eo][ep]C[I think this is a bad invasion

MM: It is a good invasion point, and you can get a good result such splitting Black's side, but the timing is wrong.  First you should punish Black for leaving the two stones so soon.  I think anything near one of the triangles would be good now.]
;B[pl]
(;W[qk]C[MM: I think a hane works better. You have too little space to easily make eyes, so you need to break Black apart and run to the center or to the O3 area.]
;B[pk];W[qm];B[pm];W[rn];B[qo];W[ro]TR[rj]C[MM: So close to the edge of the board, this is not good shape.   If you let Black get S9, you have real problems.  This might be better at S10, I think.]
;B[rk]C[MM: Good move by Black.];W[rl];B[sl];W[rm];B[rj];W[rp]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[po];B[pn]
(;W[op]LB[oo:B][op:A];B[oo];W[sm]C[MM: A wasted move.  The group is isolated and does not have room to make two eyes, so it is dead. The worst part is that Black has beautiful strength facing the center.]
;B[sk]C[MM: Black wasted a move too. Capturing the T8 stone would not help White at all.]
;W[pj]TR[cl][el][ep]SQ[qk][ql][rl][qm][rm][sm][rn][ro][qp][rp]
[rq]C[MM: Since the large White group is dead, this looks like an overplay to me.  Why not attack the two Black stones?]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[qh];W[ep]C[MM: Yes!  Good move.];B[fc]C[MM: What?  Black does not care about the two stones?  This looks crazy to me.]
;W[hc]TR[dj]C[MM: Doesn't the D10 area look better?];B[jc];W[he]
;B[cf];W[ee];B[bd];W[cc];B[cj]C[MM: Too bad, you let Black reinforce the B4 stones. The area you gained around the F17 stone is small, compared to the area you lost on the left.]
;W[ch]TR[dm]C[was this a good invasion?

MM: It is late, but it is a good place to invade. The D7 area also looks good.]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[cg];W[bi];B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[bj];B[bf];W[ah]
;B[ck];W[bk]TR[dg]C[MM: No, not necessary. You already are alive no matter what Black does.  Cut instead.]
;B[cl];W[bp]C[MM: Good move!];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[mc]C[MM: Another good move.
Do not forget to collect your sente moves around the D6 area.]
;B[nc];W[kc]TR[md]C[was this a good move?

MM: I think N16 would be better.];B[eg]C[MM: Eliminates the D13 cut. Good for Black. Odd timing, though. I think the fight near K17 looks bigger.]
;W[jd];B[bl];W[ak]C[I think this is unnecessary

MM: You are right, it is not necessary.];B[al]C[MM: This also was not necessary, at least not yet.]
;W[nb];B[oc]
(;W[hq]C[MM: This would have been a good move before you went at E4.  Now it looks too slow. Maybe something near F6 instead?]
;B[qc];W[oq]C[MM: I do not like this move. It does not gain points for White. It does not take points away from Black. All it does is force Black to fix a weakness. You should save this move to use as a ko threat, in case a ko pops up.]
;B[pq];W[no];B[sq]TR[ml][en][nn]C[MM: Not necessary. Black could play something like O6 or N8. Or even better, something near E6.]
;W[gh]C[MM: Good! That's the right idea, make Black's center-facing thickness into useless stones.]
;B[sp];W[gk]C[MM: Yes! Another good move. Black is wasting moves capturing dead stones in the lower right. This is a good way to profit from the Black mistakes.]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[fk]C[I started to control the middle

MM: Yes, and you should have started sooner.

Now the huge Black wall is only making a few points, when it could have controlled the center.]
;W[nh]C[MM: This looks like a good way to sacrifice the two stones, in exchange for a huge center territory.]
;B[oi]C[MM: Of course, a normal move.]
(;W[nj]C[MM: No, you do not need to save just two stones. Instead, use them to get leverage and build a wall facking the G10 stones... Check the variation.]
;B[ni];W[mi]SQ[mh][mj]C[MM: Risky cutting points];B[mh];W[lh]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[ng]C[MM: A wasted move. Instead Black should cut at N10.]
;W[lj]C[MM: Good!];B[gd]C[MM: This looks too late.];W[hd];B[cd]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[de];B[fe];W[ff];B[ef];W[ge];B[fb]
;W[eb];B[hb];W[gb];B[ga];W[gc];B[fa];W[ea];B[gf];W[ha];B[fg]
;W[gg];B[fe];W[hf];B[ff];W[fl];B[el];W[nn]C[MM: Good];B[on]
;W[fm]C[MM: Very good. White has a large territory, and should now win the game.]
;B[em];W[ml]TR[fn]C[MM: I think F6 is more important];B[ns]
TR[ms]C[MM: Good timing for the monkey jump reduction. I think this could go all the way to N1, for a larger reduction.]
;W[mr];B[ms];W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[or];W[nr];B[os];W[ob];B[pb]

C[A ?

MM: Yes, A is better by one point.];B[nm];W[ek];B[ej];W[ce]
;B[be]C[Did I manage the middle well, or did black make a mistake?

MM: Black made some mistakes, and you were able to take advantage.  Good job.]

;W[ka]C[May I please have 2 questions answered?

1.What are my weaknesses?

2.What do I do to improve them?


Thx for the review!!!!

MM: To me, it looks like you have weaknesses in two main areas. But do not worry, all of us share these weaknesses, and they become less severe as you play and study.

First is seeing the big parts of the board. You should have played something like the E4 attacking the two stones at C4-D4 *much* sooner.  You should have cut at D13 to split the Black group, and probably kill one or the other. You should have neutralized the Black left-side wall and claimed the center sooner. You did not, because you thought other moves like P4, O18, and H3 were bigger.

Second is tactics. For example, your handling of the R8 group, and playing at A9 when you did not need to, and creating weak shape with O10. Luckily, Black did not take advantage, but the center territory could have turned out very differently otherwise.

What to do to improve? First, play serious games and try to win, then review the game while it is fresh in your mind to see what you could have done differently where you felt unsure. Second, solve lots of life and death problems to improve your tactical reading. The GTL sister site www.goproblems.com has lots of good tsumego. Later on, you may like to study joseki, but I do not think it's the most important for now. Third, actively look for situations where you can sacrifice stones to gain more than you lose.

Your lack of fear is a strength. Some players are afraid to invade, for example, but you are not. Keep playing and striving to improve, and I am sure you will eventually reach your goals.

I hope my review is helpful. If you have questions or find some of my mistakes, please email me:
