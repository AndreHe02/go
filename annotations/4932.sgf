C[hudou: hi

Hello reviewer, please review for white. This game was played on KGS, my opponent was unrated, and I am 8k. I am still kind of lost and confused as to how I lost so badly during the course of this game. Then again, I am still kind of weak, so i am lost and confused about many things :P.

Hello.
I reviewed this game from White's side. White's problems are : 

- attacking from the wrong direction : you should attack from your weak stones towards your strong stones, not the opposite.
- making some moves in the beginning/middle that had no value (like saving 1 stone, or making plays in an area where there'll be no territory) : it is important to try to remember to make plays that have value.
- creating too many groups, hence having the burden of lots of weak groups to defend, and ending up living in gote or dying. These weak groups and their high number is the result of a play style too aggressive, that privileges cutting and double approach moves, leaving some weakness (extending is good!).

See the end for more general guidelines.

And remember attacking does not mean killing. Pressuring the enemy in order for yourself to extend and take points is enough to win.]

Those are the most common moves in that position.
A is the normal defensive extension, see variation
B and D are pincers aiming at preventing a potential black moyo, see variation
C is another good move, but more aggressive since it ignores black's approach on white's corner]

A black move at A is here more usual, the move played here is a bit more aggressive.]

Reviewer:

This is correct shape. White keeps itself connected and keeps black separated. Corner is open to black (A), but then again black tenukied when white approached, so if Black A, White B and takes the other corner, game seems equal so far.]

Reviewer:

This seems a bit slow to me. The triangle marked stone can get out still easily, so aiming at making a moyo by playing on the 6th line seems a bit ambitious. White's marked stones can get out easily and are connected so adding another move does not seem urgent. If Black approaches White's bottom corner with A, B, White will pincer in order to profit from the strength of the square marked White stones. Therefore, I wouldn't play on the left side either. In my opinion, taking the top right corner with C is the best move, although approaching the bottom corner with D or E also seems playable.]

White here played 6 moves for zero territory., that is what I meant when I said it was slow.]
;B[ci]C[--------------
Reviewer:

Black up to this point seems extremely territorial.
First signs where his first 2 moves on komoku (aiming at corner enclosures), then he immediately jumped into the first open corner. This extension, which is by the way a bit too close, and on the 3rd line only, seems to highlight his extreme territoriality.]

Reviewer:

I think it would be more better to jump at A.
The correct way to attack in go, is to play from your weak stones towards your strong stones. Here the 1 group is weak while 2 is strong. By playing from 2 you'll only make 2 stronger (not usefull) while weakening your 1 group.]

(;W[qf]LB[qc:C][ej:A][dm:B]TR[ck]C[Somehow this attack went all wrong too

Reviewer:

Once A was played, White just cannot ignore it, and should defend his marked stone. It's a very important stone, it's crucial in defending the corner.  A play at B seems fine.

Black is very territorial. It seems a bit ambitious for W to make a double approach move on the top right corner. Simply taking territory seems better, with a move at C for example. Here white just invites black to play a kosumi and separate him, increasing his number of groups to 4 already, with 3 weak groups...]

This seems bad shape to me, this kind of shape usually makes you end up in gote. Once again, it will developp Black's marked stones, making White's marked stone even weaker. Simply extending at A seems better to me.]

Reviewer:

The exchange of A for B seems very much in favor of Black. White got out to the center, but none of black's group are in danger since they have a strong shape, and Black B is another territorial move taking points. It would have been better to go to the contact at C, I believe.]

Reviewer:

This is very very small, it has zero value. Black's triangle marked stone means there'll be no territory for White in the triangle area. Same for the square marked stone. To summarize, there'll be no points for anyone at the top, so why play there? Approaching at A or B is better. Also have to remember to defend around C soon.]

Reviewer:

White gets the correct idea here, but sadly White choses to make his move ignoring a serious Black attack, after a couple of useless and small moves Black made. Black's last move makes the 1 group under big attack and could prove problematic for White because when Black moves out in the marked area, both White's 1 and 2 groups will become under attack. So white should extend his 1 group.

Also, this is the second time that White made an approach in a Black corner, and that Black ignored, allowing White to get his second move there first. And in both cases, White chose to make a double approach instead of just taking corner territory, adding another group to his already long list of weak groups. Potentially 6 groups for white here... 7 if Black approaches the bottom left corner.]

Mistake. The 2 group can still get out by playing around the marked area. It's not the 2 group that's under attack, it's the 1 group. But White here is reinforcing the 2 group, which will reinforce black in the middle and weaken 1 even more.]

We see here white A was played too far from the corner, and why making a double approach move on the corner is a lot worse than just taking corner territory. White has way too many weak groups to defend.]

Totally unreasonnable cut. White's weakness is that he has way too many groups. So why cut to create even more of them? Black can still live in the corner so it does nothing but create more trouble for W.]

6 groups for white.];B[jo];W[ll]C[The fatal error; I resigned after this sequence, as I have almost no points on the board and am losing points fast.

--------------
Reviewer:

Black is simply attacking White's weak groups and making points out of his attacks. White cannot attack any Black group since Black was very territorial, making simple if small extension, and getting bases for all his groups. But White kept attacking, cutting everywhere, and creating too many weaknesses for himself.
The corner approaches are good example. When you approach a corner, what do you do? You *threaten* to take it (and therefore take corner territory points) if the opponent ignores you and moves elsewhere. Twice white had that opportunity, but instead chose to make a double approach move, doubling his groups, enabling black to keep the territory and getting no points out of it. The very beginning was fine for white, until he spent a couple of early moves for no purposes. Generally white seems to have decent shape moves, but clearly creates way too many groups for himself. My advice would be to extend more often and pincer/double approach less, and to try to keep the number of groups at no more than 4 for a start.]
