C[--> Main point to learn from this game: attack more solidly!  Both white and black try too hard to kill groups and end up damaging their own positions as a result.  White does this first on the right, but black makes up for it in grand style by destroying himself in gote on the top.  Your instincts on your opponent's weak points are good, but your methods for exploiting them are too aggressive and don't take the rest of the board into account -- play solid moves that threaten those attacks in sente, then use your strength on the rest of the board.]

;B[cq];W[qf];B[qh]C[-->b should high pincer at q13 -- makes w's potential smaller, makes it easier to run, and lets him build a huge wall facing his k16 position if w invades at r17]
;W[of];B[nd]C[--> Up to here, this looks like a pretty good game; then it gets a bit sloppy]

;B[rl];W[rm];B[rg];W[rf];B[rk]
(;W[sl]C[--> playing underneath here actually helps b make eye shape a little; usually the hane is a good killing move, but in this case your "wall" is too weak, and playing underneath leaves even more ugly cutting points (r7, p8 after the push, and everywhere else)]
;B[ri]
(;W[sh];B[sg]
(;W[sj]C[-->too early for this move.  Unless you are 100% sure b cannot break out, ALWAYS start with pressure from the outside.  In this case you had a chance to build an absolute wall facing every direction while b might have scraped by with four points in gote.  Once you were that strong, you could invade the top, expand your bottom, and/or make a moyo in the center.... the game would have been yours to direct.  So remember: pressure groups from the outside first unless you have a clean kill (though sometimes a single placement or two inside an enemy group allows you to make a solid wall and force gote life)]
;B[si];W[sk];B[rj];W[sm];B[pk]C[Forcing him to run did not look good to me because of the many weaknesses that exist in my walls.

->that's correct.];W[ok];B[pj];W[ol];B[rd];W[sf]C[-->bad, bad move.  why not let b connect his two living groups?  You need to complete your wall]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[ng]C[--> w gets almost nothing, and b gets a lot on the top (except that in the game he throws it away for a failed attempt to kill white), life on the right side, and a lot of cutting points with which to bother white.]
;B[nf];W[ne];B[mf];W[oe];B[od];W[me]
(;B[lf]C[-->posibly the losing move; b only hurting himself here....]
;W[le];B[ke]C[--> b stakes everything on killing, and ends up destroying his own top territory and leaving a weakish center group.  Losing this battle is almost like losing the whole game.  This is another example where pressure should be applied in the direction that is most beneficial to the attacking group, assuming the defending group lives.  Unless b is absolutely sure he can kill (or unless the game depends on killing regardless of whether it's 100%), he should play more strategically and less aggressively.  See previous variation.]

;W[nh]C[Now to attack his weak center group.];B[mi];W[ni];B[ki]
;W[mk]C[--> If if you are attacking a group and have your own weak group in the area, you should strengthen your weak group first -- in his case, just lj11 or so.  b can't cut at o9 yet, so the best he can do is try to run and play n9, letting you get completely solid in the process and still not being completley alive.]
;B[ih];W[hg]
(;B[ij]C[--> critical mistake.  b should absolutely push at h12, and then again at h13 first -- w doesn't get anything out of g13/f13, but b gets much stronger, develops bigger potential in the center, and has sente so he can come back and play around here or even further.  This is a crucial tactic when running, lean on enemy groups, especially when strengthening them doesn't hurt you at all (b's h17 group totally alive, w's running j14 group makes no profit)]
;W[gi];B[fg];W[gh];B[kk];W[eh];B[ci];W[eg];B[ff];W[ei]C[--> b does a nice job of grabbing c11 in sente, but pulling back with f14 is too small now, and hurts b c11 by asking for w e11.]
;B[ip]C[-->this is a huge mistake by b.  The shoulder hit helps w connect his stones that are spread too thin for this stage of the game -- he can be split at f-h 3.  The idea to build a center moyo is good, but b's group in the middle is very resilient now and can be put to use to help attack one or the other of w's eyeless split groups.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[lq]C[--> b can't make up his mind -- does he want center influence or small bottom territory?  w l4 is too perfect a move to let w have it.]
;W[jp];B[hn];W[jn];B[hl]C[I guess he is almost alive.  After I blundered later I tried to kill it, so maybe I should have still played around this group now.  But it looks alive to me.  Didn't do a good job chasing this group.

--> You had your own weak group to protect];W[rr]C[Figured it was time for large yose moves.]
;B[qs]C[-> bad!  he should play s1 in SENTE, just as you should have played j19 instead of l19.  This is a very costly time to lose sente, especially in what would have been a close game.  B loses his chance for the edge with this move.]
;W[kr];B[lr];W[no];B[lo];W[op];B[nq];W[mo]C[now w does well here]
;B[lp]
(;W[ln]C[Too small??

-->not exactly "small," since it also helps you reduce b's center, but there are definitely bigger -- the variation you suggest is one way.]
