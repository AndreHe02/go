GC[This game was recreated and the ending was removed in place of a resignation by white.]


C[This was a game played between me and one of my long time friends. We both wanted an even game because he is pretty good. I am white.

cg -- I will prefix all my comments with "cg -- ".];B[qd];W[pq]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn];W[nq]C[cg -- I always feel like this joseki is a bit slow for white.  I would probably play a pincer at Q9 instead of R5, but that's just personal preference.]
;B[pj];W[od]C[I had a lot of trouble thinking of what to do here. I am weak in moyo games, so I tried to prevent one. However, I think that I shouldn't have tried this, but instead, tried C14.

cg -- This move is quite normal and should be fine to reduce black's moyo.  But since black already has the extension in place at Q10 you can't really expect the result to be even.]
;B[mc]LB[ob:C][qc:D][ne:B][of:A]C[cg: B, C and D are probably the most common variations here.  I prefer B.]

(;W[of]LB[oc:B][qf:A]C[cg -- I don't know much joseki either, but I don't think this is one.  It allows black to connect at p17 and get a huge corner, and white ends up with a weak group.  See variations here and at previous node.]

(;B[qf];W[me]C[I don't think I followed joseki here. In all honestly, I didn't know the joseki.

cg -- Letting black get the corner so easily was a mistake.  (Even though black didn't take it until much later.)]
;B[kd]C[cg -- I think you must L14 here, otherwise black can close your three stones in quite effectively by playing L14 himself and building a large moyo in the process.  Later in the game you mention that you like to play the two space extension but it ends up getting cut.  In the fuseki that is often okay, and I think it would have made sense here.  That is, play M15 instead of N15.  Or possibly even counter-pincer at L17, which is a more "active" style.]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd]C[cg -- Maybe black should play F17 instead, for balance with L16, and to make invasion more difficult.]
;W[cj];B[ep];W[gq];B[cq]LB[dp:B][bq:A]C[cg -- I actually prefer varation B here.  I tried to find the best outcome for black that I could, and I think it is still better for white.]

(;W[bq];B[dq]LB[cm:B][cn:A]
(;W[cn]C[I was wondering if C6 is correct, I think the normal move is B5, however I wanted to move slightly faster because I felt I was behind.

cg -- I have seen B5 and C7 but I'm not sure about C6.  With either C6 or C7 I don't see any reason for black not to play B2 first.  See the variation for an alternate line of play.  (The variation would still work with C6.)]
;B[fq];W[gp];B[br];W[bp];B[kq]C[At this point, I felt that black made a mistake by leaving his D3 group because it is attackable. So I did not respond to L3, but instead, I attacked black's D3 group. Was this the correct choice?

cg -- yes, absolutely];W[gr]C[cg -- This is a nice, dual-purpose move.  Threaten to kill the group on the left and gives a nice wall to drive L3 into.]
;B[op]
(;W[ds]TR[od][me][of]C[cg -- How about E5 instead?  It gives white lot's of influence toward the center and make it ko to kill black.  Unfortunately, the ko is probably bad for white because of the liability in the marked group.]
;B[er];W[es];B[fs];W[fr];B[cs];W[gs];B[dr];W[ar];B[fs];W[es]
;B[en]LB[eo:B][jp:A]
(;W[jp]C[I decided to leave the battle to semi-settle my stones. I didn't notice that white's stones at B4 is actualy unsettled. Black attacked those later.

cg -- Believe it or not, I think E5 works out very well for white here.  (See variations.)  I don't like K4 much because it forces black to rescue his L3 stone.  Probably better to push up a bit more with the G-line stones (perhaps G6) and then cap at L5.  There's not much hope of actually capturing L3 though, because O3 is weak.]
;B[kp];W[oq]C[I almost did not want to play P3 just yet, but I decided to do it just for security reasons. In retrospect maybe I should have continued to attack black's D3 group?

cg -- P3 seems not so important to me right now, since L3 has already run out.  In any case, I would suggest N3 instead.]
;B[mp]
(;W[gn]C[cg -- See variation.  I like D8 here because (a) it removes any weakness on the left side that might allow the black group to live easily, and (b) the bottom white group can now build strength while attacking the C1 group, in the hopes of cutting later at O4.]
;B[fm];W[jn]C[This move bugged me for the rest of the game. I wonder if instead of playing K6, I should have played F9? F9 seems to give me a nice moyo at the top left, enough to make the game even again. Later in review, I showed black F9, but he responded by doing G7 first, which forced me to do K6, and then he did D8, and then it led to many variations. Would F9 have been better for white?

cg -- I think this move is okay.  If you can make your G1 group secure there is some potential for pushing through at O4.  F9 looks like an overplay.]
;B[io];W[jo];B[fp];W[dp];B[go];W[fo];B[eo]C[Black realized that he overplayed by doing G5, and I tend to agree with him.

cg -- Absolutely.];W[ho];B[cl]C[This was hard to respond to. I was wondering what the optimal move is for white?

cg -- D8 is good.  It's possible D7 works because of the potential cut at E7, but hard to say.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk];W[el];B[ck]
(;W[dj]C[I didn't want to allow B to attack or kill C10 and C14 because it would have been too big a loss so I decided to play D10. I think either way, im in a tough situation.

cg -- I would do the opposite and drive black toward the C10 stone with E9.  If he tries to save his D9 group white will have a chance to attack the bottom left black group.  Once you've decided to risk the entire B4 group you need to go through with it.  See variation.

cg -- C10 and C14 aren't enough compensation for the lower left corner, given that white can invade at C17 using the aji of C14 stones.]
;B[ek];W[fl]C[At this point, I consider actualy killing black in the bottom because I couldn't be sure that i could make 2 eyes with my C4 group.

cg -- If white plays first the C4 group should be able to live.  Otherwise dead.]
;B[aq];W[ap];B[gm];W[bl];B[gk];W[bk]C[In the end, It ended up like this. I decided that I had to allow black life in exchange for a connection to my C10 group. I realized that i could still force a ko with B1 so I could still potentially kill black later in the game if I had him surrounded.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[fi];W[eh];B[jq];W[mn];B[np];W[fh];B[kf]C[After i saw L14, I realized that F12 might have been a mistake. However, I think that if i didn't play F12, but instead play L14 myself, that B would play F12 and i'd be in trouble regardless. However, I think that L14 instead of F12 gains more for white.]
;W[fj]C[cg -- You should atari at F9 and escape.  Just capturing one stone at F11 is small.]
;B[fk];W[gi];B[bi]C[cg -- This move can be ignored.  This is white's chance to rescue the top right group.  See variation.]

(;W[bj];B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[bh]TR[ob][qc][pg][hl]TW[fi][go]
C[cg -- B12 is very small.  White needs to secure the top right with one of the marked positions and H8 is a useful peep.]
;B[im];W[in];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[km];B[jm]C[I had a feeling that black would cut me up. I like the 3 spaced jumps, but people seem to cut me up with them all the time. However, if I do a 2 spaced jump, it just looks extremely slow.]
;W[ko];B[lo];W[mo]C[cg -- These two forcing moves by white are anti-suji.  They only serve to reduce your liberties.]
;B[lp];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jr]C[I think black made a big mistake here by not playing N7. Black realized it pretty quickly though.]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[mm];B[kj];W[mj];B[nh];W[ok];B[pk]C[At this point, I was having a very hard time trying to decide where to play. I considered trying to connect to the top with N15, and I considered attacking L10 and K6. In the end, I think I played it wrong.

cg -- Very hard for white now, with two weak groups and black strong everywhere.  Black is ahead even without killing either of the two weak groups.]
;W[ol];B[lk];W[jl];B[kl];W[hm]C[I got lucky that black didn't notice this. However, I still felt I was far behind.]
;B[mk];W[nk];B[oi]C[I didn't know what could be the best move here. I planned something with S6, but I misread and it turned out very bad for white.

cg -- Should play J8 in sente and then save top right if possible.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[qm];B[ql];W[rl]C[This was a desperation move. After this, I felt really bad and behind because I didn't read it properly.]
;B[pm];W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[qi];W[oj]C[I dont know if I could have done anything with that side, so cutting and attacking black's 2 stones at N12 and P11 seemed a good consolation prize.]
;B[ni];W[li];B[nj];W[nl];B[jk]
(;W[ik]C[cg -- This was gote.  Just capture at J8 in sente and then save your top right group.]
;B[il];W[hl];B[gl];W[jl];B[kh]C[I don't know if I could have done anything to eat O11 here. Is it possible if black plays it right?

cg -- It's possible if you didn't have to play K8 in gote.  See previous variation.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[mg];B[lj];W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[kg];W[mh];B[mi]
;W[ii];B[jj];W[ih];B[ij];W[hj];B[hk];W[il]C[I somewhat wanted this part to happen, because now I have surrounded black's bottom group and can use the ko at B1 with a good chance to kill black.]
;B[og]C[But in exchange I had severely threatened death for white's top right group.]
;W[nf];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc]C[In the end, I couldn't make it live by itself so I decided to play the ko at B1 and if it didn't kill B in the bottom, it would atleast allow me life at the top right.]
;W[bs];B[as];W[ng]C[At first I thought this was a complete misread and a non threat, and it still seems like black could have avoided responding and dealt with the cut at L15 later, however black decided to respond so the ko battle was saved.

cg -- This is not a threat.  At the very best it allows white O16 to live in gote here, which is irrelevant since black would win anyway.  Black should fill at B1.]
;B[le];W[bs];B[gj];W[hi];B[as];W[oh];B[og];W[bs];B[em];W[el]
;B[as];W[qe];B[bs];W[rd];B[ro];W[rp];B[sn];W[hd]C[I was wondering if this is the correct move. I didn't know how to invade and do a lot of damage, if its possible at all.]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[id];W[gc];B[hb];W[gd];B[fc];W[gb];B[ib];W[jc]
C[I felt I might have had a chance to save both G17 group and K17 group.

cg -- Even if there were no chance, this is a good move.  "Sacrifice two stones instead of one."]
;B[jb];W[jd];B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[kc];B[kb]C[It turned out that I couldn't save them, and I only hurt myself because now black has his J15 stones inside a potential moyo i could have made if I had ataried the other way at J15.]
;W[gf];B[fb];W[hf];B[ig];W[fa];B[ea];W[ga];B[db];W[lc]C[I just wanted to see if it was possible to do anything with my K17 group. I had to try, because I felt far behind.]
;B[lb];W[ld];B[md];W[ke];B[lf];W[lr];B[mr];W[mq];B[lq];W[nr]
;B[kr];W[ms]C[At this point, black got impatient and he did extremely unreasonable moves, to the point where I ended up killing black's L14 group, J15 group, J18 group, and O17 group. He resigned when i killed them. However, to this point, I think black was still focused and playing correctly. If yose had played out properly, I lose by around 9.5 points.

In the end, I really can't figure out where I went so wrong as to be behind the entire game. From what I see, it was that intial move at P16 that got me behind. That, and the fact that I ended up trying to barely live everywhere, so I was short on territory. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me : 

cg -- I'm not sure if P16 was the best possible move at the time, but I don't think it was fundamentally wrong.  The problem came more with the two followup moves, P14 and N15.  These three stones made kind of a clump and black was able to easily make territory on either side of them.  There were two problems: (1) I don't think P14 is joseki.  It allows black to take the corner with P17, which is too good for black (even though black didn't take advantage of it).  (2) I think you should play more dynamically there. For example, instead of N15 try a counter-pincer at L17, and then mix it up (fight) a little.]
