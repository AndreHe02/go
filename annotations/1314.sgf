C[Dear reviewer,

I had white in this game.
After the game my opponent said that according to him I played too many moves on the second line during the fuseki.
Common go-knowledge says indeed you shouldn't play too many second line moves in the opening, but how should black have played to punish this (up till move 57 where the fighting begins) ?
Any other comments are also welcome.]

Hai, my English is not very good and maybe make some mistakes in my spells, grammer and Go terms. But anyway hope I can help you to read the game.]

Yes, it feels that w is somewhat slow. If both b and w play most correct moves now to the end, then perhaphs b will win a few points.

But 2 w groups are very solid, so I do not think it's a big problem consider there is a possible target, b triangle group.

sorry I cannot find out any immediate way for b to beat w.

For high k*s and low d*s, the most important thing is too learn how to fight in the middle game. The opening is important but it's much harder to master and usually it do not determine which one of us will win the game at last.]

I think this move is correct.];B[ck];W[ff];B[hd]

Maybe too brave.
This can be a good move if w is strong outside. But now I cannot find 2 clear eyes from 5 outside w stones.]

Yes this is a joseki, but better do this when w was strong and b was weak.
Or say this is a defensive joseki for b.

Now left side w group(D15 group) become stronger with sente. So I think it's an even game now, or perhaphs w is leading.]

Well you asked me to evaluate your 2nd line stones before this move.
So I counted 2nd line stones on board and they are as follows.

w 2nd line:  6
w 1st line:  1
b 2nd line: 6 (including H2)
b 1st line: 0

so are there any significant difference between w and b?];W[kq]

w is winning I think.

I will do this.];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[fb];B[bk]
C[QianJiang, Jan2003:
w can live in the corner, but with no big area. <10 points?

what I feel: b lose ~15 area at a19 coner, but the value of 35,37+31+39 is enough to counter, and   39 is a big place! w group have to make eyes near strong b wall. what we can foresee is b will become even thicker in the process and get a sente to make a moyo in leftbottom(a1 coner).]

(;W[bk]C[QianJiang, Jan2003:
I think the most important thing for w now is ensure the safty of this group.

B9 is important point for both side. If b go here, w group do not have enough space to make 2 eyes?]
;B[cm];W[cl];B[dl];W[bl]LB[be:A][cc:B][ek:C]C[QianJiang, Jan2003:
Now w strengthened this group and then he have some choices.
For A19 corner, maybe just A is enough for w.]))
