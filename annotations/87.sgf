AB[dd][pp][pd][dp][dj][pj][jp][jd][jj]C[I am black.  I play against this person with a nine stone handicap
reguarly, but I usually lose.  The beginning moves are fairly
standard for our games.

Here are my comments .. I hope they are some use to you .. please
email me back with feedback on them. Generally I think Black
plays well in this game. White is rather over cautious.

Robin Hobbes];W[fc]
(;B[df]C[This is my standard response to an approach move when I am getting
a high handicap];W[nc];B[pf];W[jf]TR[jd]C[This is how my games with this person always start.  If he manages
to surround the marked stone and connect his three white stones,
I generally lose the game

Black decides to save the stone .. another possibility is to
give it up and get thickness as a result.]
(;B[le];W[ne];B[lg]C[m13 is very good. It is a fast move separating white into 3 groups]
;W[ng];B[li]TR[ph]C[The sequence up to here is also standard for our games.  I have
normally played 10 at the triangle insead of here, however. =

So, this is where the game becomes unusual for us.];W[ph]
(;B[og]TR[ph]C[I wanted to cut off the marked stone and isolate it   The problem with this move is that it strengthens white - threatens
your m15 group and leaves the corner still open to invasion]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[mg];B[lh]C[I played here to maintain my connection back to the upper side
handicap stone];W[rh]
(;B[rf]TR[qf]C[Is this a better way to keep white out of the corner than playing
at the triangle?
There is yes .. see variation];W[qj]
(;B[qk]C[r9 is not solid enough. It allows white to attack.  Nearly always
when black with 9 stones play solidly];W[pk];B[ql];W[oj];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[qi];W[qh]
(;B[ri]TR[qj]C[This was my first mistake.  I should have captured the marked
white stone];W[rj];B[pl]C[This move was intended to make a better moyo on the lower right
in Sente

I think this is best local move];W[ok]
(;B[pc]C[I was worried that white would invade the corner and possibly
kill my group.

I agree although it is a bit premature so probably d17 is best]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[mk];B[lj]TR[nj][ni][nh]C[I decided to expand my two walls by forcing white to capture
the three dead stones];W[mj];B[nl];W[nk];B[ol]TR[ql][pl][ol]
[nl]SQ[lj][li][lh][lg]C[Are the two marked walls worth enough to make up for white gaining
a strong group in this area and isolating my upper right corner?

I think so .. black plays well locally];W[nq];B[pq]TR[pn]C[I thought that jumping out to the triangle would be playing too
close to my wall.  Blocking the corner seemed better

Blocking the corner is much better .. well played!];W[lq]TR[kq]
[jq]C[I was suprised when white only extended this far.  I had expected
white to jump to one of the marked spaces.];B[jq]C[k3 is also very good. Solid]
;W[mn]
(;B[no]C[I wanted to make more territory on the lower right side by pushing
against this white group.  I hoped that the territory would be
worth enough to make up for strengthening white here.

Yes this is a bit early. Only strengthen white when you need
to defensively or there is no other big move and so the territory
is worth it but there are a number of big moves left.];W[mo]
;B[nn];W[fq];B[dq];W[cn]
(;B[fo]LB[cn:53][dq:52][fq:51]C[Was this a reasonable response to white's moves?

This is a bit loose given how strong black is here.];W[go];B[gp]
TR[fq]C[I intended to isolate the marked white stone.  I wanted to kill
it.];W[fp];B[gq];W[eo];B[fn];W[ep];B[do];W[en]TR[go]C[Now that white got out, I decided to attack the marked stone]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[in];W[gr];B[ip];W[hr];B[hp];W[er];B[dr];W[dn]

(;B[bo]TR[cn]SQ[co]C[I wasn't sure I could live in the corner without adding something
to block the marked stone from undercutting me.  Should I have
played at the square instead?

This is a bit complicated and I am not sure see variation for
one possibility]
(;W[cr]C[white moves too early];B[ds];W[bq];B[bs]C[I didn't want white to play here and start making eyes]

liberties.];W[cs];B[br];W[cq];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap];W[as];B[bs]

 But black is very much ahead - merely a blip!];B[hh];W[bh]

two weak groups now];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[dc]C[Very good timing]

the upper left corner
 Yes good idea];W[hc];B[gb];W[ae];B[be];W[af]

continue in the upper left];W[bd];B[cd];W[bc];B[bf];W[ag];B[sj]

anyway, so I save these 4 stones];W[of];B[pg];W[qe];B[oe]TR[nf]

me to cut off the invading stone.];W[mf];B[qf];W[lf];B[kg];W[kf]

marked stone.
 This is probably best as marked group looks potentially vulnerable]

territory here

play at 223];B[ei];W[mm];B[nm];W[an]

any more groups after the lower middle group died.

to connect here.
