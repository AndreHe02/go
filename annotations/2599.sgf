C[Thank you for reviewing my game. I was White in this game.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[do];W[cm];B[en];W[fp]C[This seemed reasonable, but is apparently not a joseki move.

Comment: In the joseki continuations it  ends not being an efficient stone, and also has a weak point around H3. G3 is one joseki.]

(;B[dl]
(;W[ck]C[Comment: This gives B a chance to settle his stones....]

(;B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[br]
(;B[jp];W[fn]C[I felt it was important to keep Black split and get out into the center, but this might not have been the best way.

Comment: The proverb says "don't attach to stones you want to attack." You end up making your opponent strong. 

Perhaps a better approach would be to strengthen the left first (maybe D10?). B moves into the centre, which induces W to fix up the weak spot at E3/H3. Your move at F6 leaves your groups thin everywhere!]

(;W[dg]C[Maybe I should have played the double hane.];B[cc]
;W[dc]C[I felt I had to block this way to prevent overconcentration.


Comment: On the other hand, you are giving up territory, and the thickness you get blocking on the other side does exert a little more pressure on the B stones ...  blocking this way leaves you behind in territory, so you have to make the thickness count.]

;B[gm]C[Maybe I should have responded to this to stay ahead, but in the game I got to h6 first anyway.

Comment: It doesn't seem likely that you will gain much by answering. The B stones are strong, and W doies not have much territory, so you have to go all out and get some!  A B move at N16, N17 limits the value of your thickness.]
;W[nc]C[Comment: Good! Playing here 1st is big. You might also consider O16.]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[me];B[gh]C[A very nice point. Now the group has eyespace and it will be difficult for me to use the wall effectively. Is there a move I should have played in this area earlier?

Comment: I don't think so. W has made the best of the top,  and the three N15 stones reduce the B moyo on the right hand side. The B group in the middle is not that weak: its hard to find a decisive attack here.]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[om];W[hn]
(;B[jn];W[jr]C[A silly move, maybe.

Comment: Yes. If B ignores this and plays (say) J8 to stake out the centre are you going to follow up K2? The W stone is very low, and the centre is big....]
;B[lq];W[kj]C[This doesn't turn out well. A safe extension to around n12 may have been enough.

Comment: The B centre is still open at H7, so this is unnecessary. Moving out with J7 looks better.]
;B[pg];W[qi]C[Comment: This is asking for trouble.]
(;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[qg];B[re];W[qf];B[oe];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf]
;B[rd];W[qk];B[pk];W[rk];B[pj];W[rl]C[Connecting is nice, but doesn't seem to be necessary or big enough. The next few moves decide the game.

Comment: Your group does appear to be alive without this. So how about a move like K13? This would expand and protect the W moyo at the top, as well as providing support for L10.]
;B[kg];W[mg];B[mh];W[im];B[jd];W[jf]C[Comment: This leaves the W stones in trouble!]

C[Inexcusable.];B[hc];W[id];B[ie];W[ja]C[Comment: W lives, but B is well ahead. Although you do get to make some nice reductions in the middle, B secures enough territory in sente.

Overall you placed too much emphasis on attacking the B stones in the bottom left early on, neglecting the territorial balance. The thick W stones (D16) did not have much impact, and the W stones on the right were low.]
