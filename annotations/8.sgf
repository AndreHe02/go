C[I played this game rather recently after not playing for a few weeks. I tried to improve my beginning game, by not allways just responding locally, but trying to take big points.

I am around 10-12k and so was my opponent (apparently)

RickMott: i'll take a quick look at this one and add some
comments, too.]PL[B];B[dd];W[pp];B[pc];W[dp];B[qe]C[I liked this start. I have had something similar played against me before and I am quite happy for this as an opening taking advantage of the black lead. Any comments?

>> I like this opening too, its one of the more standard openings that you see.
(not necessarily the best.)
The "focal" point of this opening is k16 (A), White usually responds here, if not
its a great spot for black];W[fc];B[jc]C[Loose pincer to strengthen q17]
;W[dc];B[cd]C[Was contemplating c17. Saw some danger at c13 if he played there, forcing life, but he didn't]
;W[ed];B[cg]C[So I played there, securing the top left of the board and leaving corner undecided

RickMott: seems overconcentrated.  I'd probably play C17; you get
either the corner or the side.  You'd like to extend to C12 from
a 2-stone wall.  If you get more liberties plus corner strength
first, you can.];W[hd]C[>> I dont like white H16 here. It asks black to strengthen the k17 stone, which he
does next

A better move for white would be at a(f13) or simply to play elsewhere]
;B[je]C[I liked this as it made a nice? shape. Any other recommendations to keep the presure on yet build up on the top right?

>> this works nicely with the upper right corner to map out territory
It doesnt really put pressure on  the white group which is pretty strong]
;W[pj];B[cn]C[was hoping for a bottom board response and then to take a point around c10

RickMott: Some play to disrupt white's development will probably work
better.  I'd like a play at O3 or K3, for example.  The left side
won't be big for either player.];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp]
;B[cj]C[This worked just as well.


>> i would prefer A or b here, You dont want white to get too much center influence
if you play at A and white invades at c10 you have a great target to attack]
;W[em]C[This left the cutting point but, I think I had to respond?

>> yes, you had to respond to this, if you played elsewhere, both c7 and d8  would have
been great for white
If c10 had been at c8 you could respond at e8, which is slightly better]
;B[dl];W[el];B[jp]C[To prevent k4 being taken by him :) Maybe the cut first? But I wasn't sure it would still work and this seemed bigger

>> I agree. Save the cutat d5 for later when you know how usefull it would be

RickMott: Yes, this is good timing];W[hp];B[nq]C[>> This is a little too wide here, white is strong on the left and attacking at m3 could
well seperate your group in half.
  RickMott: No this is a fine move.  This shape is easy to attack
but hard to kill.  I use it all the time.];W[np]C[>> White just helped your possition here, w should attack at A or strengthen
his position for a later atack at A. (Using b or c)];B[mp];W[no]
;B[oq];W[qq]C[wasn't sure what to do after r3, so I decided to play elsewhere, trying to make the top right bigger. I was contemplating n13 which I think would of been better]

(;B[ph]C[RickMott:  I think you're in pretty good shape in this
game.  You have no really weak groups, so let's see where
White might be attacked.  Your weakest group is at the
bottom, so any attack should support it or at least not
weaken it further.

F4 is a possibility, aiming to cut off H4 and make the
white wall useless.  If you want to take territory in
the upper right, P15 is the standard move.  C17 is still
good.  Q7 is playable also.

You have some fairly solid territory, so your goal now
is to destroy white's moyos while keeping your groups
secure.  If you can do that, you have an easy game.];W[qi];B[qh]
C[>> you should be pushing towards your thickness, not away
 Dont expect that corner to get really big, want you want to do is keep
white small and push him towards your large group so that you can defend it while
pressing him];W[ee];B[eg]C[to try and enclose the white group

>> A is preferable here, it protects your area and the two black stones and still
leaves you with the ability to get out to the center
It would be really hard to enclose the white group, it has plenty of room to get to the
center.

RickMott: agree, this is too small, build the upper right enclosure
with something like N14.  Makes it much harder for White to get in.]
;W[mg]C[RickMott: as you see, his next move is an attempt to reduce
your moyo.  It's so wide open this is impossible to stop.];B[me]
C[he got there first];W[mo];B[lp];W[io]C[RickMott: 43 is a small move for black.  You should either complete
your territory with P14 or try a move like O11, theatening
to enclose white N13 on a huge scale and giving you a way
to reduce his lower right side later.];B[kn];W[nj];B[mm]C[to try and decrease the territory on the right (better ideas?)

RickMott: White has shape weaknesses you should take advantage
of.  Consider R9 (if he ignores it, R10 threatens to cut or
connect) followed by Q6 (again, threatening to cut with P4)
and then R5 to start making shape.  White has to worry about
life in the corner now.  You should be able to live or run.]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[lo];W[mn];B[kl];W[jm];B[mk]C[trying to find space for life, with the option of withdrawing to the top or the left, while also threating the right side. (I was not sure it could live by it self)

>> You might be able to exploit p4 a little here

RickMott: I still like Q6 instead of trying P4 directly.];W[ll]
;B[lk];W[nm];B[ml];W[nl]C[RickMott; White's territory is solid now, which is
too bad; you didn't get much for it.  Now you MUST
try to cut off N13.  Best now is probably O12.];B[nk];W[ok]
C[RickMott: P11 peep is very good here, with
continuation at O13 and N13.];B[jj];W[op];B[mi]C[try to join to the top]
;W[ni];B[mh];W[nh];B[ng]C[was I strong enough to cut here?

RickMott: Yes, you have to after this sequence.
But maybe separating with O12 originally instead
of N11 would have worked better.];W[mj]C[>> blocking at m10 would probably have worked fine. (see the variation)]

(;B[lg]C[secures the top but makes life hard for the middle group

RickMott: I don't like this.  I'd protect the weak stone
by extending at P13.  Yes, white has some ataris, but
they don't lead anywhere.  You wind up with a huge
corner as compensation for sacrificing the middle group.]
(;W[kj];B[jk]C[RickMott: cut at M10.  Nothing bad happens; read it
out.  If white ataris your connection is also atari.];W[lj]
;B[gj]C[L9 should of been played at this stage?

>> w l9 does capture];W[mf];B[nf];W[lf];B[kf]C[why he played that sequence I don't know.]
;W[og];B[of]C[RickMott: Why block when you can cut at P12?]
;W[rh]C[>> A is fine here]
(;B[qf];W[rg];B[rf]C[I feel as though I lost a lot of points in this sequence, but was there a better alternative? Should I have been looking elsewhere?

>> S14 is pretty small.  E9 Would have been fine];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj]C[This makes joining up with the left hard..]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fi];B[ih]C[trying to give room to the centre group while also threatening to connect to the top area - stil cuttable though..

RickMott: G13 here captures in a net.  Some complication if he
ataris at E12, but no big deal.  or even play wider at G14, but
you want to cut off and kill those 3 stones as your connection
from center group to left side.];W[gg];B[fg]C[try to force the connection]
;W[hh]C[RickMott: White 98 is a mistake.  Your best  sequence is a throw-in at G12.  If white
captures, squeeze at H11 and if he connects, you
have a ladder into your top group. starting with
the atari at G14.

 He shouldn't play this, so you capture the
3 stones and connect to the left side.]
(;B[gi]C[>> this should be at A, still forces the connection, but leaves you with  a move to connect to the top]
;W[gh];B[hi]C[this makes the connection secure between j12 and k10]
;W[gf];B[if];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[jg]C[I think this should of just been a simple connection at j13]
;W[kk];B[jl]C[Should of seen this earlier];W[ll];B[im];W[in]
;B[jn];W[lm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hk]C[This was too small.. the big points I see are :
H18, (is that the best place to start?)
J3 (again, is this the best place?)
c18
Is it too late to try to do something about the bottom right?

>> this is fine , white must protect his area now which leaves you with sente
And some aji for use later];W[gn];B[cc]C[got one of them, but maybe not the right point.]
;W[db];B[pr]C[another bigish point];W[qr];B[do]C[try to cut...

>> if your arent going to follow up with the cut at e4, save this for later
It leaves you with 1 extra liberty if white tries to use c7]
;W[eo];B[he]C[force life];W[ge];B[hb]C[big point, and really force life if ignored]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jd];B[kd]C[this was confusing];W[id];B[kc]C[but it seemed to work out (but lost sente, prolly j3 first)]
;W[ci];B[dh]C[response to threat];W[cl];B[cm]C[I was uneasy here, but not sure why, b8 seems better]
;W[cf]C[
>> This is where you see the moves i suggested earlier would have
helped.. (d14 and c8) Both of those would have removed all the
aji white uses to his advantage now)];B[bf]C[RickMott: Why underneath?  Play D14, he
can't do much.  Not enough liberties.];W[be];B[ce]C[this lead to an interesting battle]
;W[df];B[bg];W[cb];B[bb]C[but this secured it I think];W[iq]
;B[jq]C[should of played here before before losing sente];W[jr]
;B[kr];W[ir];B[fb]C[I played this to try and punish c11

move!];W[gc];B[gb]C[>> This should kill white, he only has 1 eye]

at M2, which makes a big problem for you.];B[eb];W[jo];B[ec]

something at the bottom is better here];W[sf];B[se];W[sg]C[>> bad move by white]
;B[nr]C[I was scared about this group as mentioned before

>> l1 might be better

RickMott: Agree, this move doesn't make a sure
eye.  I like N2, M2 or L1.  White still has big
aji with the clamp at M2!];W[ri];B[ko]C[worth 4..];W[pq];B[or]
C[>> l1 deffinatly worth more];W[ks]C[RickMott: weak move by White.  if he clamps
at M2, what do you do?  Not sure you can live.]
(;B[ls]C[bad responce, this must be m2]
(;W[mq];B[mr];W[lq]C[I nearly fell for this one...

Thanks for having a look

>> Your welcome.  Some general comments:

Trying to defend your upper territory early let white build his lower right
territory.

You tend to leave a lot of  bad aji in your positions (potential for white to do your
groups harm ;-) Some slightly better shape in the beginning would have helped
you towards the end.
