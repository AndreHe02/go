AB[dd][pp]C[Dear Sirs,

I have a rank of 20k and I would like to have a review of this game ...

I have also a disire to get some advice for making my play "lighter" I
think its rather to "thick"
Also how can I cope with an invasing starting from the second rank. I
think I won with my moves 150 152 154 ...

The moves before move 150 lets say 50 moves back I really had no big
clue what was going on ....

Thanks in advance and looking forward to a nice review,

Joeri];W[pd];B[dp];W[fc];B[dj];W[fq];B[jp]C[K4 is an fine move -- but it can be very complicated.  You  might consider simpler the simpler variations at e3.

The most probable line from that is b e3, w f4, b d6 and then w h4-ish.

Another alternative to k4 is d6 and h3.

Again -- there is nothing wrong with k4 -- it's just a very difficult move.   Don't play there just because it's a star point. :-)]
;W[dr];B[fo]C[f5 is not  so good.  it is not hard enough on w.  you've got a good idea in going after  outside influence -- but f5 is too timid.

f4 would be stronger.

c3 is also a good move.];W[iq];B[qn]C[i'm honestly not sure if this is a  good move or not.  my feeling is that now isn't a good time to leave k4 --  maybe reinforce with j4 or h5?

take h5 for example.  this sets up a nice wall across the bottom -- b h17 is  now a powerful attack.  the idea is to drive the white stones towards the  wall at the bottom.  not necessarily to kill f17 -- but to make it live  cheaply, and build another great big wall to drive more white stones against  or create territory with.

this is not to say that shimari at r6 is bad -- i just don't know if it's  the proper time.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[kp];B[lq]C[
this is not so good.  you are strengthing w here, and hurting your k4  stones.  the profit that you gain on the lower right (which is still open to  invasion) is balanced by the damage you're doing to your center.

pulling back with h4 would be much better here i think.  it makes f5 a  valuable stone, and you'd still have room to do something in the lower  right.]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[hp];B[io]C[j5 makes the "empty triangle." this is just about the  heaviest shape you can make.  you almost never want to make this shape.

"lighter" shape would be j6/k6.  im not really strong enough to say which is  better. :-(]
;W[cf];B[df];W[cc];B[ce]C[why not c16? c16 sets up b17 and makes  the threat of d17 much greater.

c15 is a bit timid.];W[dc];B[cg];W[cd];B[ed];W[be];B[bf]C[good.  capture here is absolutely right move.

your stones are very strong, you should be able to turn this into some real  points on the left side and into the center.

btw -- the caputer at b14 forms a 'ponuki.'  a ponuki is the epitomy of good  shape. :-)]
;W[fd];B[bd]C[b16 is an end game move.  your c15 group is alive  without it, and b16 only reduces w score by ~6pts or so.

this is not a very good place to spend sente.

reinforcing your stones along the bottom at h5 is also a huge move.   an  approach move against q16 is also possible.  even q3, solidifying your  corner would be better than b16.]
;W[bc]C[b16 seemed like a good move,  because now white did what you wanted -- he answered you.  it feels like  sente.

but just because you can force someone to do something doesn't mean you  should. :-)

now -- white does have to block here.  if w ignores b16 then b b17 puts a  lot of pressure on the white c 17 group.  but, if you save your b16 stone,  then white has taken sente.

at this point, it would still be best to play elsewhere, even if that means  w captures b16.  to prove this -- just imagine  . . .

b h5, w a16, b l5.  your top left group is still safe, and now your bottom  groupis all connected, and w is sealed in on bottom!]
;B[ae]C[again -- a15  would've been much better as an approach against q16.

another example -- b o17, w r14, b q8, w r17, b l17  puts you in a much  better position.

with the sequence begun with b16 and continued here at a15 you spent your  sente.  always make sure you get enough for spending sente!]
;W[jc]C[
ouch! what a great move for white!

could anyone doubt this k17 is bigger than the capture at a15?

always spend sente wisely! :-)];B[qj];W[ho]C[with h5 you can start to see  why j5 was not so good. w is threatening the sequence w j6, b k5, w l6 for  the net and capture.

if you had originally played j6 instead of j5, then you could answer h5 with  k6.  this would form "the bamboo joint" and make you a nice shape for  escaping.]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[in]C[
i wonder if playing b3 might be better?

a big part of w's ability to invade the left side comes from his threat to  connect up with his c2 stones.

if you're worried about the atari at j6 then a plausible line of play would  be:

b b3, w j6, b m6.  m6 threatens to save the stones in atari, and makes some  nice territory for b.]
;W[bm];B[bk]C[c8 maybe? remember, on the second line,  w needs a line of 8 stones in a row to live unconditionally.

so -- perhaps b c8, w c7, b d8, w d7 and b caps at f7? that's the general  idea anyway.

the key to remember is that you want to flatten w out, since he needs so  many stones on the bottom to live.

and also -- take note that countering b7 would be very, very easy if you had  a stone at b3.  this is because white couldn't use threats to connect out to  extend his base.]
;W[dm];B[fm]C[
think how much more effective f7 would be if you had c8 and d8 to allow the  cut when . . .]
;W[el]C[white plays here and you answer . . .];B[fk]C[with  e7.

but since you played b9 instead, i think you pretty much have to let w out.  :-(

at this point i think f8 is probably better than f9.  f8 shows very good  spirit -- trying to get ahead and trap the invaders -- but it is very loose,  and w can punch through it.

f8 keeps the pressure on w, and reinforces your lower group at the same  time.  this is important, because your lower group is coming under attack  now.

one thing i am working on right now is never, ever leaving weak groups  behind.  i felt like i was being to conservative -- but whenever i can force  myself to do this, i win.  so -- don't leave weaknesses! (like i usually do  :-()]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej];B[di];W[fi];B[gj]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[gi];B[hj];W[gg]C[white's  invasion at b7 has been a complete success.  i think we can blame j6  (instead of reinforcing at b3) and b9 (which should've been at c8).]
;B[hh]C[
what is h12 for? w can defend easily at f13, and f13 just makes him  stronger.  also -- w can still h11 with no problems. i think this is another  case of forcing the enemy just because you can.

watch out for moves like this, they make the enemy say "thank you."   personally, i am especially prone to make these moves at times just like  this, when the enemy has just won something from me.

trust me -- it only makes matters worse! :-) when you've lost something,  it's best sometimes just to take 30sec to relax, and look at the board.

to me, three places on the board cry out for attention.

1) The lower left.  You group needs some reinforcement.  imagine if w were  to play e5 right now! near as i can tell, your c3 stones would die!

2) l5.  this is critical for turning your large moyo in the lower right into  territory.  if white pushes up through here, he can cut the area in two and  rob you of many, many points.

3) an approach or invasion against the upper right.  im really not strong  enough to say what properly should be done there.]
;W[fg];B[cn]C[good! guards against e5 in sente!

it's moves like this that victory is made  of!];W[cm];B[bn]
;W[dn];B[do];W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[gn];W[go];B[hn];W[fp];B[am]
;W[al];B[an];W[bl];B[bp]C[good.  makes life without  a  doubt.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[ij];B[hk];W[ih]C[you are lucky here.  w should  definitely l5.]
;B[ji]C[
k11 is a good move.  keeps w from taking a ponuki in the center.  there is a  proverb, "a ponuki in the center is worth 30pts." basically, you always want  to block a ponuki if at all possible.  (a ponuki is the shape that would be  formed if w captured by playing k11 instead of black)

please notice the ladder that black is possibly setting up.  if white  doesn't protect j12, then o16/17 for black is very attractive as a ladder  blocker and to get a foothold in the upper right.]
;W[hg]C[
w protected himself against the ladder, so now b still has the great move at  l5.

because w squandered sente with his atari at j12, b has a chance to get back  in the game.]
;B[ko]C[
EXCELLENT! :-)

this move is as important as 150-156 in securing the game for you.

if you didn't play l5 here, i don't think you could've won the game.

let us take a moment, and reflect on the power and beauty of l5.]
;W[qh];B[rh]C[enough reflecting on quiet beauty of l5.  s12 really helps w  as we'll soon see . . .]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[qg]C[now -- you managed to keep sente  in this exchange which is very good.  not so good is the exchange itself.   for yourself you secured about three points of territory.  at the same time,  you forced white to strengthen his upper right corner.  your option in the  upper right are limited now.

going back to s12 -- i think you might have been better off attacking with  q14.  you are so strong in the bottom right, you should be able to  vigorously attack r12 and make q14 live.  that would make white just look  silly. :-)]
;B[jh];W[ig];B[jg]C[
still -- the upper right is crying out.

b would be much better served by an invasion at r17 or o17]
;W[nh]C[
even if you'd been able to keep sente, k12/13 wouldn't have done you much  good.  p11 would'nt gain any extra territory.  p12 would let white sneak in  at q11.]
;B[nj];W[li];B[kj]C[
n11 might work better for b here, threatening to cut w off with m12.

b n11, w m12, b m10 is likely variation.  if w l10 then be can l11 with now  worries.
b n11 would keep w from using atari to break into the  territory.]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[pj];B[pi]C[q11 is not so good.  gives w lots of  oppotunity to monkey around.  q9 is correct.]
;W[oi]C[
fortunately, w p11 is not so good either.  w should instead play r11.

imagine:

w r11, b p10, w s10 (atari), b r9, w captures s11 stones.

or . . .

w r11, b s9, w p11, captures black stone.];B[oj];W[pk];B[ni]
;W[oh];B[qi];W[mi];B[qk]C[
i think o8 would work much better here.

b o8, w r9, b r9, w s8, b cuts at r8.  b should be able to kill the q9  stones no problem.]
;W[kk]C[
uh-oh -- this could get ugly! but i think if b n9 the all will be  well.]
;B[pl]C[uh-oh! the danger here is to the m9 group.  r9 should be able  to connect to r6 no matter what.  i know it seems like r9 is the bigger  group -- but the stones in the center (m9, o10) are in much bigger danger.   they are probably worth more,  too.]
;W[mk];B[ll];W[ok];B[nk];W[mj];B[ol];W[ml];B[mm];W[nm];B[lm]
;W[nl];B[nn];W[lg]C[w has done an excellent job of reducing  black's moyo.  although you made many tactical mistakes along the way, i  think that you should look at move 102 at q11 instead of q9 as the problem.

q11 is too aggressive.  it is important to be reasonable in go -- especially  against stronger players.]
;B[jf]C[
o15 is better i think.

also, consider an invasion at r 17.  i beleive b can unconditionally make  life there.]
;W[ld];B[lf];W[mf];B[kf]C[
m15 is better.  it's still connected, and threatens further penetration into  w space.]
;W[he];B[ff]C[again -- r17 cries out for invasion -- even if it  doesn't work, you'll lose nothing in sente! :-)

to me, it looks like it's about even on the board, but w has many more nasty  things to try.  also, if w is tied going into the endgame in a handicap  game, then b is in trouble!

at any rate  gote moves like f14 arent going to win the game.  you've got to  pull out the real show stoppers!]
;W[ge]C[
well -- i guess it's only gote if he answers! :)

but consider the horrible violence that w can do to black with moves like  b10 or m2.

w b2 is also excellent right now.  takes some profit in the corner and is  absolute sente.  if w b2 and black plays elsewhere then w b3 kills the  entire group!  (white either gets the atari against c3 and then the  placement at b5 to kill the eye, or if b connects at d3 then w a4, b a5, w  c5 kills black again.

so -- g15 is a very bad move.  which means that f14 is probably a bad move  too.]
;B[gf]C[
i can't stress this enough -- what does g14 accomplish? yes -- it forces w  to connect at h14 - but - what wants to do that anyway!

g14 forces w to do what he wants and doesn't make a whit of difference in  points.  what's worse, after w h14 then w e14 is atari against the b stones.    so b has to choose between gote and his stones.

a bad choice. :-(];W[hf];B[fe];W[eg];B[ie]C[r17 still sings out to be  played.

white's threats at b2, m2, and b10 still remain.  all this stuff is very  minor compared to those.

ask yourself -- what does j15 really  accomplish?];W[ee];B[ef]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[dg];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd];W[id]C[very bad of white.  he needs to j17 here.  j16 is very  insolent.  we must punish him.  oh yes, he must pay!]
;B[le];W[me];B[ic]C[
good! this is the right idea!

only -- it is better to start the attack with m17.  why? because if w  decides to ignore the first atari and protect his other stones, losing m16  hurts way more.  there is much more room to expand over there.  always give  the enemy the most chances possible to shoot himself in the foot!

but it's a minor point.  j17 is definitely a good move, and you are on the  right track.]
;W[hd];B[lc];W[md];B[kb];W[jb];B[ib];W[mc];B[ja]C[yummy!

im honestly not sure which is better -- to capture at k19 or to connect at  m18.

i think you did it right  . .. but im not sure.];W[ec]C[i would ignore this  atari in favor of playing p18.  b  p18 is a great move.  after b p18 there  are two great moves for b -- either n18 or c17.  both are utterly  devastating to white.]
;B[de]C[d 15 is worth a whopping 7 points in gote.   this is not so good compared to

p 18 was easily 3 times this.];W[gb]C[g18 is not so good.   w needs to  protect p18.]
;B[hb]C[
h19 is almost worthless.  maybe you'll get two points out of it.

p18 is still the biggest point on the board.

t13 is very nice.

b2 is pretty good.

as is l12.  in fact, l12 is absolute sent as we'll see in a bit).]
;W[lb]C[
w has the idea now.];B[ga]C[
not so good.  still very small.

t13.  b2.  l2.

even connecting at l17 is better than g19.];W[fa];B[ha];W[kc]
;B[jc];W[la];B[aj]C[good! protect! :-)];W[ck];B[cj];W[br];B[eq]
C[
okay -- this took me awhile to figure out, but it looks to me like w can  kill black now.  here is the sequence:

w b3, b e2, w d3, b e4, w f2, b e1, w c4, b c5, w a4, b c3, w d1, b f1, w  h2, b a5, w a3, b b1, w g2, b a2, and w c4 is atari.  b can't win this since  white has infinite liberties between capturing a2 and c3.

that was only one of the paths -- but they all either end up with b dead  outright, or some ko which w wins because of infinite internal ko liberties.

so -- e3 is bad.  b needs b3.];W[er];B[bq]C[
excellent! :-)];W[lr];B[mr];W[mq];B[kr];W[jr];B[ls];W[hr]C[
now -- i now it makes you kind of dissappointed not to get anything out of  the atari at h3.  but -- you do get something out of it -- w had to protect  it, so now you have sente! :-)]
;B[nq]C[
good idea! when you are ahead so late in the game, it's best to defend  weakness.  the only thing i might suggest is q3, since that puts some severe  pressure on n3 AND it makes it harder for w to mess with your corner.

but o3 is still very good.];W[on];B[om];W[mn];B[no];W[ln];B[kl]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kn];B[jn];W[lo];B[jo];W[mp];B[lr];W[np];B[op]
C[
this entire sequence from o3 on is excellent.];W[sg];B[sh];W[ka]
;B[jb];W[dk];B[ak];W[ki];B[jj];W[kh];B[kg];W[hc];B[if];W[js]
;B[qq]C[
i don't actually know if this move is necessary.  i think i would make it  myself though.  it just makes it so there is no question whatsoever -- b  wins! :-)]
;W[aq];B[ap];W[ar];B[bo];W[dq];B[ep];W[ph];B[ac];W[ab];B[ad]
;W[bb];B[lc];W[nb];B[mo];W[pc];B[mg];W[mh];B[lh];W[pj];B[pk]
;W[lg];B[kc];W[ng];B[gm];C[
all in all you did a good job.  to highlight a couple of points:

1) Never waste sente! Keeping sente is a big part of winning.  If you have  to lose sente, make sure it's for something worthwhile.

2) You don't have to play in the same area as previous moves.   It takes a  lot of courage to play elsewhere -- but you've got to play the moves worth  the most.  If you can make yourself do this (especially in the first  50-75moves) you'll jump several stones in strength.

3) Never, ever make empty triangles, if you can at all avoid it.

4) Don't play on star point stones just because they are star point stones!  (I did this when I was your strength -- it really held me back for awhile.  :-()

5) Before you play a move always ask yourself -- why am I playing here? If  you don't have a good answer -- play somewhere else.

Finally -- a book suggestion.  If you do like playing sanrensei (three  handicap points in a row) then I highly recommend the book "The Power of the  Star Point" by Tokugawa.  You can get it from Kiseido.

I also suggest the site http://www.goproblems.com.  Work on the problems  there and you'll learn tons about proper shape.

And -- another finally.  In the grand scheme of things, I'm not that much  stronger than you are.  Every thing I said (except that part about not  wasting sente! :-)) could be flat wrong.  Much of it is almost certainly  sub-optimal.  Don't take anything I've written  (except the general sente  principles) as gospel.  It's just advice from someone a tiny bit more  experienced . . . .]
