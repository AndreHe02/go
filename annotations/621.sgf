Hi,
   I was playing as black with 4 handicaps and I am about 17kyu. I know I  have many small problems to fix in my game but my main concern for this game  was defending strongly outlined territory. The main points where this was a  problem were in the bottom left, and the middle right. I am not sure whether  there's a problem with how I secure the territory, or how I defend it from  attacks. Are there any problems in how I secure area that is causeing some  of the small captures such as in the left middle and right middle? Thank you  for your time.

no2k: I was happy to comment this game. You played a good game. There were only some slight mistakes, but they counted very large.
You should have connected on the left side. As you lost this 6 stones, your complete center stones died too. This small mistake lost the game.  Don' t hang on stones which have no meaning. In general a single black stone attaching a white 4 stone wall is completely useless. Ignore this stone. Play big moves.  During the whole game the corners were unprotected. A 3x3 invasion was possible. Try to avoid 3x3 invasions when your resulting wall will make no sense.
In the end you made some unnecessary moves, which allowed your opponent to retain sente. Try to play big endgame moves for your own.

enjoy your next games,  Peter Hoehe as no2k];W[jp];B[jm]LB[mq:a]
[gq:b]C[no2k: A capping move is good only, when you can attack strongly. This white stone is easy to defend at points around A and B.]
;W[jd]C[no2k: So white didn't answer];B[hc]C[no2k: Good];W[ho]
;B[hn]C[no2k: Another capping move. And you are attaching. Attaching makes both sides stronger. Was this your aim?]
;W[fp];B[fn]LB[dj:a]MA[fn][hn][jm]C[no2k: You built up influnce with the 3 stones. You should try to use it. Play around A.]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[nj];W[nm];B[nl]LB[ol:a][pk:b]C[no2k: This only helps white. Without this move there are cutting points at A or B.]
;W[ol];B[mo]C[no2k: What pupose?According to theory moves should defend territory or attack. This move tries to connect two groups, which are not attackable strongly.]

;W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[os];W[ns];B[qr];W[mq]C[no2k: Black secured a big corner. But white got a big territory at the bottom. Black's N5 stone is superfluous now.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[ko]C[no2k: Good sequence. Black reduces th white bottom area.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[ph];B[oi]LB[nh:a]C[no2k: If you have a 2 stone 'wall', you always extend 1 stone. Play at A. These stones can't be disconnected.]
;W[pi];B[qf]C[no2k: Good];W[me];B[md]LB[pb:a][oc:b]MA[oi][oj]
[nj][nk][nl]C[no2k: Seems to be misreading the situation.  1) This does not secure the corner. A move at A or B is necessary.
2) White is surrounding the black group on a large scale. Black should avoid beeing catched.]

[cd:b][dj:c]C[no2k: White has invested a lot of moves to kill the 5 stones. Just give them up and take territory at A or B or perhaps play at C (still good).]

;B[ij];W[jk];B[ik];W[dj]C[no2k: Good. I would prefer on the 3rd line.]
;B[ck]C[no2k: I would prefer A. White might attach now, and will become stronger.]
;W[cj];B[ej]LB[dk:a]C[no2k: That does not work. You cannot expect to kill this group. But if you play at A, you will surround territory on the left side.]

(;B[dg]LB[cg:a]C[no2k: 4th line moves are for influence. Black cannot use influence very good here.  Black can secure territory in sente with moves around A, which threaten to leave white with only one eye. See var]
;W[ei];B[fj]LB[cg:a][oc:b][dq:c][cd:d]C[no2k: This stone is useless. Give it up. Play at A, or one of the other big points on the board.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[eg]MA[bg]C[no2k: Failure in direction. Be careful when your partner 'looks' into your territory as the marked stone does. White can reduce with the monkey jump later in the game.]
;W[fi]C[no2k: Black and white have both solid positions. White has a considerable area at the bottom. Black on the right side. Now the big pionts become urgent. 3 of the corners are not secured. Black should secure at least 2 of these.]
;B[gi]C[no2k: The following moves are are very very small. Try to count the value of a move in the center, and one of the move i pointed out.]
