C[Llywelyn: First, thank you in advance for reviewing my game.

*UH6* Thank you for submitting it! This is the first game I've been asked to review for the GTL and I'm pretty psyched about it.

I have two goals for this review:

1) I hope to be able to give you good general feedback on how to think about variouis situations.  I think this is more immediately helpful than getting caught up in specific variations.

2) The other thing I'm going to do is try very hard not to over-reach myself.  I have weaknesses in my own game and I'm sure I'll miss a lot of things and that a better player could take issue with some of my suggestions.

This is ok because to my mind the main goal here is to help you improve your results, not to teach you to play perfect go.  :-)]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]C[Llywelyn: This is the first time I've experimented with the High Chinese Fusek

*UH6*  I don't know anything about the chinese opening. I play it myself sometimes but mostly I play san rei san or if I'm in a more conservative mood something like what white has done here with the two 3-4's.

I do think generally speaking that this type of move is very passive.  Approching one of white's corners puts pressure on him right away and that is always a good thing.  Later this will be a a big fuseki point to take but for now I feel like this gives white his choice of options and a reasonably comfortable game.

However this is only my opinion. A lot of strong players play exactly as you have.]
;W[pg]C[Llywelyn: I've seen a couple of opponents do this in actual games and the computer seems to do it every time I play against it, and I am never quite sure how to respond.]

(;B[nd]C[*UH6* 
 This is fine.  Here are a couple of other plays you might try in your games but your move here is good.

Notice that both of the variations I suggest are LOW MOVES (on the third line)

Low moves are good for getting settled right away and for making territory.  High moves (4th line) are about getting influence and encouraging the opponent to invade so you can force him to accept a small cut-off territory while you end up with potential territory all around it.

The main complaint about the one space jump you made is that those stones are a lot less secure than they look.If white ever develops along the top then invades that corner you could find those stones baseless and hunted.  You might find moves that give you a more solid position work better. I try to keep a balance in my own games between high and low plays and it makes a big difference.]
;W[de];B[eq]TR[pk]C[*UH6*
here is part of the problem with playing the marked stone so early.

white now has a shimari (corner enclosure) in the top left.

you were left the option of either approaching his other stone to keep him from getting a shimari there, or making your own shimari in the lower right and allowing white to have 2 shimari to your one.

As it stands you have to get sente out of this or he can approach your 3-4 and have one shimari to your none. 

Notice if white had not played 3-4 moves in each of his corners he couldn't do this.]
;W[do];B[hq];W[fp];B[fq];W[jc]LB[pk:a]MA[nd][pd]C[*UH6*
this is a very good move
My first response would have been to approach the lower black 3-4 stone preventing the shimari and weakening the 'A' stone.

however white finds another good move. he makes his perfect extention from his shimari and at the same time puts pressure one the two marked stones. 

So now as black you have to ask yourself 'hmmmm do I take a big point and let him attack my upper right, or do I make a move in the upper right and let white get 2 big points in a row?'

Not a happy choice to have.];B[qo]
(;W[ho]LB[ch:a]C[*UH6*
White should probobly follow up with something like the variation. a move around 'a' keeping his options open is good also.

building a wall like white is doing is probobly a little premature since he is sooooo open on the left.]
;B[ip]TR[qf][cg][ng][ch][dh][ci][di][cj][dj][ck][dk][cl][dl]
C[*UH6*

I like any of the triangle moves.  I think black's move here is a little slow.  The three black stones are pretty resilliant.  the biggest thing here is keeping white from building a huge framework and the way to do that is to play around that middle left star point area. attacking the lone ranger in the upper right and at the same time settling those stones is big too.]
;W[jn];B[cj]C[Llywelyn: It was about here that I realized that if I let this point get taken, it would be very difficult to get the entire left-side back.

*UH6* 
Yes, I agree :-)];W[ln];B[lp]TR[cg][dh][ei][ek][dl][cm]C[*UH6*
Good move. big walls like the one white is building don't always mean big territory. 

Since you have so many good (marked) points to extend to right now you ought to be able to still get in at least 2 of these moves.]
;W[gc]CR[gc];B[lc]TR[qf]C[*UH6*
I think the marked move is more agressive. white now has to think about how he's going to keep that lone ranger in the upper right out of trouble.

The move played does strengthen your stones but... it threatens nothing. White essentially got in a nice move for free here.]
;W[no];B[np];W[on];B[pn];W[dq];B[cg];W[ce];B[cm]C[*UH6*
Goood good! 

i think black is winning here by at least 25-30];W[ep]C[*UH6*
tiny.];B[gp]TR[bf][kf][qf][eg][qi][fl][fn][bo]SQ[fo]C[*UH6*
Noooo! :-)

here is your chance to really put this away with any of the marked moves.

This has been a tough habit for me to break. The habit of responding to all the opponent's moves. this move in not worth a respons here. Really, what is white going to do if you play elsewhere?

Note that the move at the square is a cut that leaves most of white's wall floating in the middle eyeless and surrounded on three sides.]
;W[go];B[op]C[*UH6* 
My Guess is that you realized you were ahead and are just being really careful. This is a good way to end up geting behind. You should always look to increase your score. :-)]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rg];B[jj]TR[fh][qi][fl][fn]C[Llywelyn: Attempting to reduce the entire lower side and perhaps a bit on the upper-left as well.

*UH6* sure this is good.  And in this position mucking up the middle ought to win for you. 

Consider the marked moves though. they reduce AND make territory at the same time. double bang for the buck.]

;W[an];B[bl];W[lb];B[mb];W[kb];B[mc]TR[fn]C[*UH6*
The marked move threatense a nasty cut AND expands the left side.

Remember in the late middle game to look for moves that do more than one thing. The marked move does three (attacks, makes territory, and reduces opponent).]

;W[sj];B[rl];W[es];B[fs]C[Llywelyn: Is it my imagination or could white give me hell right about now by playing G2?

*UH6* 
Not really but it does look scary! That is why i suggested the other move when you made the empty triangle. why make shapes that will give you trouble later?

the next move I put in a variation of what happens if white tries g2.]

;W[kh];B[jh];W[lh];B[kj];W[lk];B[lj]C[Llywelyn: I liked this move because it neatly separated the two white groups, however, would a play around E12 or G12 have been bigger?

*UH6*
I haven't commented on the last few moves. But yes E12 has been begging to be played for a long time. you systematically cut of his groups and connected your own.

Trouble is, all the groups that you connected were already alive and all the groups of his(hers,its) you cut off were also alive.

this is a case where it is better to just take big endgame points like E12 than to seperate.
the way to tell is this:

If you seperate, will the opponent have to play moves to make life so that you can take big points? If yes, seperating can be good.  If not, dont sweat it. same with connecting.
If hes just seperating 2 living groups while you make big endgame plays, great for you.]

Yay! :-)
Nice win.

here are the things I think will help you the most based on my observation of this game:

#1) Be agressive.  Always try to make moves that pressure the opponent.  In the opening you missed many opportunities to go on the attack with forcing moves.

#2) look for moves that do more than one important thing.  In the late middle game you were ahead by about 25-30, you won by 3 1/2.  you recognized that a move like E12 for instance was big, but you allowed yourself to get distracted by smaller moves until it was too late. :-)

#3) Don't be afraid to tenuki when the opponent makes a small move. If you always respond to every move of the opponent you will always be a move behind.  If he is threatening a one point move in the middle game, play a big move somewhere and let him have the one point.  Only exception is if he is actually threateing the life of a group or a really big cut.  Make sure a threat is worth a response before you decide to respond to it. If it isn't... then YOU decide where the action is going to happen.

If you do these three things more consistantly I think your play will be 4 to 5 stones stronger just from that.]
