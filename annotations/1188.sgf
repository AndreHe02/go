C[This game was very close. Although I had a greater amount of territory, white had enough captured pieces and (my) dead stones to beat me by 1 1/2 points. I am still a beginner to Go strategy so I would appreciate it if you can give me some useful tips on how to improve my game. I am unsure of my current rating, though it is probably 22-24 Kyu. Thanks.

laver (7k): I am pleased to review your match. I will focus on the black side, although some comments will be referred to white.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[po]C[laver (7k): Until now, a very common fuseki has been played.
While black has secured a corner, white choses an opening strategy which is likely to bring to hard fighting. All of his stones are on the fourth line (influence-oriented rather than territory-oriented), and he claimed no territory, yet.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[np]C[laver (7k): This move is not considered joseki, because it leaves the weakness at P3, which could be exploited by white. The best move for black here is O3.]

(;W[qj]C[laver (7k): Also this move is not considered joseki. White is a bit overconcentrated. R11 is better. White should not be concerned about the invasion in R9, because it only works with a black backup stone in R13 (see variations)]

(;B[jc]MA[pi][qi][qj][pj]C[laver (7k): This move is in the wrong direction. In an ideal situation, the best move for Black to develop his shimari is one of the marked points. Since White is already in there, the best move would be R12.]
;W[qf]C[laver (7k): now you see how R12 was big? Good move for White]
;B[jq]C[laver (7k): very good move for Black. It also strengthens the group in the lower right, and reduces the weakness in P3.]
;W[fq]C[laver (7k): very slow move for White. No territory is secured, and little power is gained. A good move would have been D10, making a san-ren-sei, for instance.
Do you remember? White chose a fighting opening strategy, so he should continue on that...]
;B[cj]C[laver (7k): Great! If White does not play in there, it is up to Black now! For Black C10 is better than D10, since it secures a base.]
;W[cf];B[gc]CR[hb][ib][jb][ja][ia][ha]C[laver (7k): A bit dangerous for black: if White C7, black does not have a base.
Why to risk so much for the mere 6 marked points?];W[fc];B[cm]
C[laver (7k): WOW. Black thanks White for his indulgence, even if now I think you can realize that the extension at G17 is a bit weak now...]
;W[gd]C[laver (7k): indeed!];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[je];W[if]
C[laver (7k): The match is entering the middle game, so let's stop for a while thinking about the situation.   1) It seems that no group is in danger.
2) Black is strongly ahead in terms of territory:
 - the invasion at C17 is still possible
 - the invasion at C3 is still possible
 - black has very solid groups in his two corners
 - white has just some points on the right
 - black has also part of the upper and lower sides.
3) White is slitghly ahead in terms of power:
 - black has very little power (most of his stones on the third line)
 - White has some power on the right
 - White is developing a small Mojo on the upper left.

So, at the end of the day, Black seems to me to be ahead, now.
What to do next? The mojo white is building on the upper left is not so big, especially if you think about the invasion in C 17.
Moreover, if you try to reduce it, then most probably you won't be able to invade at C17 any more, so your reduction won't be very effective, giving secure points to white in the corner.  I would reduce white's power on the right, with moves like O6, P10 or Q14. Otherwise, I would invade the lower left corner.   In any case, Black has very little to develop, since he has little power. His only concern now should be to reduce White's power.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[fb];W[ec];B[bg];W[bf];B[cg]C[laver (7k): the last three moves were rather poor: The redution was very little, now white's group is very solid (and big!), while black's gainings are very little.]
;W[dg]
(;B[re]C[laver (7k):Noo!! Black is trying to reduce white's territory, while the focus is now on the center. If white grabs it, he will win! The correct move would be P10, for instance (see variation)]
;W[rf];B[pf]C[laver (7k): the previous move made White too solid. Now you're in trouble...]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[rd];B[rc];W[se];B[qc];W[pg];B[jf]C[laver (7k):black should continue in reducing white. P13 is the key point for both players. Another key point is O6.]
;W[bh];B[ch];W[ag];B[bi];W[ah];B[ai];W[af]C[laver (7k): Black thanks White, who has lost sente for mere 6 points, while the goban is completely open!]
;B[eh]C[laver (7k): this move is rather slow. If black wants to develop, By sure K5 is faster. But P 13 is  crucial...]
;W[fh];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq]
(;B[fi]C[laver (7k): what about the proposed variation?];W[gh]
;B[og]C[laver (7k): At the end!!!!!];W[ph];B[oo]C[laver (7k): What was your intention? I don't see any threat beyond your move...
Moreover, you have to continue you reduction with P12...];W[iq]
C[laver (7k): white neither...];B[ip]C[laver (7k): you neither. At the end, O5 has been a wasted move.

If you wanted to develop your group at the bottom, the peep at P6 or the calm move at O6 would have been better.]
;W[hq];B[jp];W[bo];B[co];W[ap];B[bn];W[aq]C[laver (7k): Once more very little moves for White. Black thanks and takes sente.]
;B[on];W[pn]C[laver (7k): Do you see now that O5 has been wasted?]
;B[rn]C[laver (7k): Again, fighting for few points on the second line is still premature now... This time it's black losing his sente for very little gain.]
;W[rm];B[sn];W[gi];B[he]C[laver (7k): ??? OK it is sente, but then? Keep this move as a future ko threat.]
;W[hf];B[eb];W[db];B[cb]C[laver (7k): the invasion in the corner is too late. That was possible until move 31, but then you decided to strenghten White...]
;W[da]
(;B[do]C[laver (7k):very nice exchange for black :) Compare it with the variation.]
;W[ep];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[jg]
(;B[ig]C[laver (7k): ??? You are strenghtening White again.   Keep it as a general rule. If you see some weakness in your opponent's group, but you don't know how to exploit it, leave it as it is.  Either your opponent loses his sente for protecting it (and so you have sente for gaining points somewhere else), or you will have the chance to exploit it later, when you will have prepared precise plans.]
;W[hg];B[kg];W[jh];B[kh];W[ji]C[laver (7k): in this case, by the way, there's no weakness in White's group. Your stone in J13 is of very little use...]
;B[ho];W[oh]C[laver (7k): Do you remember move 66? Now white takes this point, and gets much bigger]
;B[ng];W[nl]C[laver (7k): here White plays very well. O8 not only secures some territory, but also threatens N6, which would be a big reduction of Black's territory.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[nh];W[mn]C[laver (7k): Got it! Black has to protect against M4!]
;B[sm]C[laver (7k): Noo!!! why to play on the first line? Do you think there are no more points in the goban where it is possible to gains 5-6 points?]
;W[rl];B[mo]C[laver (7k): Aaah! Very good :)];W[ln];B[lo];W[kn]
;B[oi]C[laver (7k): A bit too deep...];W[ni]C[laver (7k): White punished you...]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[jn];W[jm]
(;B[ki]MA[oi][pi]C[laver (7k): you still have to exploit the two marked stones with N11!!!]
;W[mi]C[laver (7k): Too late. Now the two sones lose completely their aji.]
;B[ih]C[laver (7k):????];W[ii];B[lj];W[li];B[jj];W[ij];B[mj]
;W[nj];B[pl]C[laver (7k): ???];W[pk];B[rk]C[laver (7k): ????????? Remember: either you have a precise plan, or wait!

Suppose for a while that White has a weakness: why to loose such an opportunity by playing moves without any idea behind them?
Patience is the the virtue of the strong man...];W[sl];B[ro]

C[laver (7k):  ???];W[dc];B[fg];W[ff];B[df];W[ef];B[ce];W[de]
;B[be];W[bb];B[kj];W[jr]C[laver (7k):black played 5 sente (but completely useless) moves.

Why to do that?
I give you some reasons not to do that

1) You likely fix you opponent's shape, removing the possible weaknesses.
2) You don't gain any extra point
3) You waste ko threats
4) You waste chances of creating more serious problems in the future
5) Finally, sente is not an absolute concept: if your opponent does realize that he has no need to answer to your move, then you will loose sente for nothing!!!

Don't play moves just because they are sente. Stop for a while and think.
Make plans of 3-4 moves for gaining something: either power or territory.
If you don't have any plan in your mind, continue in thinking. If you still have no idea, that means that you need some help. Save your match, and talk about it with someone stronger than you, or send the match to the Go Teaching Ladder, including the thoughts you had during the match. New ideas make Go players stronger :-)]
;B[kr];W[ir]CR[en][em][fm][gm][gn][fl][el][dn]C[laver (7k): both players are too much concerned about moves in the second or first line... The center is now bigger! In this case F6 would give to Black more or less  8 points!]
;B[ks];W[pp];B[oq];W[op];B[nq]C[laver (7k): Do you see the problem of playing O4 in the fuseki (move 12)?
Now black loses sente. Even if the weakness has not been exploited in depth by White during this game, a sente is still worth around 10 points now.]
;W[fn]C[laver (7k):White took F6. Very good for him...];B[fo]
C[laver (7k): Nooo! You can't cut. It seems to me that you were desperate here.

My thought is: if you did realize with just one move of delay that F6 is very important, do you think you could realize it one move in advance, and play it?

This is very important in go. Try to imagine your opponent's or your stone in a place, and just try to feel the importance of that point.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[go];B[gn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]C[laver (7k): First defend, then attack! You have a strong weakness in D6!]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[hp];W[dn]C[laver (7k): Aaargh! Too late :( Now white's reduction will be very effective.]
;B[ao];W[em];B[dm];W[el];B[fr]C[laver (7k): Again, sente but useless moves...]
;W[er];B[js];W[fs];B[hs];W[hr];B[is];W[fl];B[dk]C[laver (7k): very good move for blocking White]
;W[hn]
(;B[in]C[laver (7k): I think you could save your stones here (see variation)]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[hk];B[im];W[gm]C[laver (7k):];B[dl];W[il]C[laver (7k): Aargh! Pay attention...]

;B[io];W[ko];B[kp];W[sc];B[rb];W[sb];B[lh];W[oj];B[qg]C[laver (7k): Again, why to do that?

This is a very close match. You don't have to do miracles to win. Keep on concentrating about the best end-game move, and you'll win by sure!]
;W[qh];B[ll]C[laver (7k): ??? Don't exagerate, it is not the case now.

The match is very close, so each mistake, even if very small, could compromise the whole match!]
;W[lk];B[mm]C[laver (7k): ???];W[nm];B[no];W[nn];B[bc]C[laver (7k): Again, sente but useless.]
;W[ca];B[gb];W[ea];B[fa];W[gs]C[laver (7k): that was an extra poinyt for white. Black G1 would have been sente AND useful: 1 point for Black.]
;B[cn];W[en];B[ra];W[rg];B[hl];W[gl];B[il];W[sd];B[sa]C[laver (7k): Some final comments.

I think that you have really good chances of getting much stronger of your opponent in a few days.

Look at the final situation. Read again your comment about the match. You said: Black has large territory, but White captured a lot of stones in the center. Right?

Think about the fuseki. I said: Black is ahead in terms of territory, White in terms of power. Power is to be used for fighting, i.e., for instance, for capturing enemy stones.
This is what happened during the match.

What I am trying to say to you is that from the fuseki the match has taken a very specific direction, which has been mantained through the end: Black had to maintain the advantage, White had to exploit the advantage in power to pull back.

So, in your opinion, which player in this match should have sought hard fighting during the match? The answer is: White !!!!

Instead, what you did was to fight and try hazardous moves! Look again at the situation in the goban.
Look at every captured stone. ALL of them (yes: ALL!) are now captured because you made some overplays seeking an overwhelming victory.


So at the end, I would suggest to you:

1) don't do sente moves without any idea
2) if you are in territorial advantage, as in this game, play SOLID moves.
3) if you are in disadvantage, play moves which bring to a hard fight.
4) Play calm. Think ALWAYS. You lose this match also thank to the bad end-game moves from 216. I know, it seems very stupid, but that's it.   Hope at least some of my comments will be useful to you :-)]

2) if Black wins the fight, then he will grab mere 10 points to White.]
