;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf];W[ne]C[[bart\] looks to the center, threatens r11]
;B[qi]C[(fred) white seemed a little high, but I felt establishing a
base was a better idea than an attack.  perhaps I should have
played Q11, one line higher?

You could but remember that playing one line higher may turn your extension a little vunerable to attack!]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[qk]
(;B[nq]C[Could also have been at Q6, see variation];W[fq]C[[bart\] better keep black from building a big side]
;B[eq]
(;W[iq]
(;B[dj]C[(fred) This was intentionally wide, as I wanted to see if an
attack on my corner could be withstood.

Well, it is difficult to defend the corner when you have a stone in the 4-4, but I want to call your attention to one aspect, joseki (see variation from black 13)]
;W[cm]C[[bart\] try to split black];B[bp]LB[cn:B][co:A][fp:C]
C[Too weak! Too defensive! Too mild! Bad move!

You could have tried one of the A-C moves];W[co]C[[bart\] need to make a base]
;B[eo]C[(fred) rather than close at C4, I felt that making an exit to
the middle of the board would be more effective later in the
game.

You could have done this by playing F4 remember?];W[cp];B[cq]
;W[bo]C[[bart\] try to make life];B[cf]C[(fred) rather than saving B4 which seemed small to me, I played
another wide move at C14.  I think one point closer might have
been smarter.  One line higher?

I think this move was ok! D10 stone is high enough so if it gets cut and attacked it will be easy for it to scape to the center!

I am concerned with K16, have you though of what could happen if white has a chance to play there?]
;W[ef]C[[bart\] i'm thinking of attack at c12];B[cj];W[fp]C[[bart\] that is dull]
;B[em]C[Nice!];W[dl];B[el]C[(fred) I needed this stone to keep white inside, but I realize
that B4's death means no chance to kill white in this corner

That's right but he didn't capture it yet, and Remeber that your group in the corner seems somewhat weak still, so you have to watch out to your group first!]
;W[bq]C[[bart\] forced to make life - can't get out];B[br];W[aq]
;B[cr]C[Ok!];W[do];B[ep];W[en]C[[bart\] another poor move];B[fn]
C[[bart\] i would have attacked at d6

D6 is not an attack! White is alive and you cannot attack a live group!]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[io]C[[bart\] don't want to get cut off from center]
;B[id]C[(fred) Too much open area on the board, so this was my attempt
to reduce.  Should it have been closer to one side or another?

It seems ok so far!];W[kc];B[fd]TR[gb][gc][hc][gd][hd][ag][bg]

[bn][cn][ao][ap][bp][gq][hq][gr][hr][gs][hs]C[(fred) Instead of F16, perhaps I should have tried something
more agressive, M16 or N16?
[bart\] i think you are too high - third line would be more trouble
for me

Well, let's count:
White has:
upper right corner  = 26 points
right side = 4 points
upper left corner = 9 points
Left side = 9 points
bottom side = 6 points
TOTAL = 54 points

Black has:
Bottom right corner = 18 points
Bottom left corner = 6 points
right side = 4 points
left side = 7 points
upper side = 5 points
TOTAL = 40 points


So black must start to worry about territory now!

Analysing the game we can conclude that there are some good points to explore like:
 1 - You can always try to invade the 3-3 point in C-17 and erase the white territory there, and better still you will finish it in sente and shift to some other place

2 - there is also a possibility to invade at R-17 BUT, it could cause harm to your group on the right side, SO you should attack the white right side group first, get strenth and then invade.

3 - L3 seems to be a good point also, it enlarges your territory and it limits white's potential to enlarge his.

BUT it is white's turn so  let's see what he does!];W[db];B[if]
;W[ed]C[[bart\] i wish i had played d15];B[fb]C[(fred) This shape for black seems unusual and not too secure
and it still leaves the M/N16 options open for me to split]
;W[lq];B[oi];W[pn];B[qc]C[(fred) this is the start of a sequence for which I do not know
the correct plays, as evidenced by the result.

So far you played well.];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc]C[See variation for the correct sequence]

(;B[nc]C[(fred) I am thinking that this is a pretty poor place to play!

Yes it was! this was a very serious mistake];W[ob];B[rd];W[re]
;B[qe];W[rc];B[od];W[pe];B[rb];W[sd];B[nd];W[qb];B[ld]C[(fred) no reason to continue dontating stones to the corner,
now I want to try to save the few that I can.

[bart\] instead of L16 (too ambitious) i should try to connect.]
;W[kd];B[me];W[oe];B[ke];W[nb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[mc];B[md]
;W[jb];B[mb];W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[hb];W[ib];B[jc]C[Nice kill.

Let's count:

White has = 56 points

Black has = 64 points

So you are already ahead ( if you can save the right group and get some territory)

Now you should go to the center and try to do 2 things:

1 - Prevent your opponent to get territory there
2 - Make some territory if you can];W[no]C[He will try to get territory in the center!]
;B[mf]C[(fred) until this play, I felt the shape had a weak point if
attacked from the right... later plays seem to confirm this.

[bart\] i still had hope of worming my way out until you played
that!

I would have thougt of N13 first but I have not thought of the whole sequence yet]
;W[nk]C[[bart\]i think this starts to build nicely

Too nice for white, the time to invade is NOW!];B[hm]LB[mm:C]
[kn:A][lo:B]C[You have to go deeper!

Anywhere in A-C is more agressive!];W[im]C[See?];B[hj]C[May be B16 first!]
;W[ce];B[jj];W[kl];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni];W[mk];B[lj];W[ch];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[df];B[bg];W[cg];B[bf];W[di];B[eh];W[ei]C[(fred)  I completely lost track of liberties and did not realize
until I played my stone that I was in Atari.  This did not help
my score at all!  What possible outcomes had I extended?

[bart\] let's see - i think the group at b14 would die];B[ci]
;W[fh]C[Bad mistake!
The attack has just finished!];B[bh];W[ek];B[fk];W[dm];B[dk]
;W[ej];B[gm];W[bk];B[bj];W[fe]C[(fred)  now the attack to try to rescue the top center stones!]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[ic];B[jd];W[hc];B[gb];W[hd];B[kb];W[kc]
;B[kd];W[fc];B[gc];W[ha]C[[bart\]i feel dumber now than before!!!]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[ga];W[ia];B[kb];W[fl]C[(fred)  I felt I had enough strength in the shape at the top
left to survive a ko battle, so this was an easy answer.  I also
thought that I could manage enough ko threats as well.];B[fm]
;W[kc];B[mp];W[lp]C[You have to continue the invasion on his territory!]
;B[kb];W[mo]C[(fred)  It seems the ko was momentarily forgotten, lucky shot
for black.

Dont'think so!  If white plays the ko he still has to play 3 stones before he can capture your group, so he played well and you missed the oportunity to invade his territory!]
;B[ja];W[gk];B[gl];W[fj];B[hk];W[gj];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq]
;B[ip];W[jp];B[ho];W[il]C[(fred)  I think I could have played at J6 with better results...
Yes!];B[hl];W[hn];B[go];W[ih];B[hh]C[[bart\]oops! i went a step too far]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[gi];B[hg];W[ro];B[rp];W[po];B[qp];W[rn];B[op]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[og]C[(fred)  I would have liked to play black here first, too much
impact on my territory, but it seemed to turn out okay in the
end.

Want to see a goo impact on his territory? 
1 - Play S10
2 - Then play L1 in Sente
3 - Then play A 17

This sequence can wipe out some 20 points from his territory!]
;B[ng];W[nf]C[(fred)   I think it was this shape for white that gave me a clue
that I could perhaps accomplish something useful.];B[qg];W[ph]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[pg]C[[bart\] good move, Fred!];W[oh]
;B[of];W[rj];B[rg];W[be]C[(fred)  after this play by white, I didn't realize that I was
a single stone away from a dead shape here.  Wouldn't black's stones be dead if white played at A11?

[bart\]yes

NO! B8 captures a stone and you are alive!];B[ks]C[[bart\] but maybe it gets messy]
;W[kr];B[ms];W[js];B[ls];W[ir];B[ai]C[(fred)  But I luckily got the chance to do something about it!]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[kk]C[Why not M9?];W[lk];B[kj]
;W[oj];B[nh]C[(fred)  this capture seems a bit premature in retrospect

Yes you had a lot to do before capturing this group!];W[np]
;B[oo];W[on];B[si];W[sj];B[qj];W[rk];B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[sp]
;B[sq];W[so];B[rr];W[ar];B[bs];W[sh];B[sg];W[gf];B[hf]C[Why not G13?]
;W[gg];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bc];B[cl]C[(fred) another lucky shape for black, one that I'd never seen
before

I was looking at his one a wild now, you will end up in sente also!]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[bm];B[pf]C[(fred) in the real-life game, white did not see the Atari, but
I felt obligated to point it out.  I think it would have been
the win for me (black) but it would not have been sportsmanlike
play.

Nice way of thinking, of course that if it were a tournament game you shouldn't point it!]
;W[pb];B[gn];W[in];B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[mr];B[ns]C[Well do you HAVE to connect now? Q10 sente, A1 sente....]
;W[na];B[dc];W[cc];B[fc];W[ea];B[fa];W[cb];B[as];W[ap];B[pj]
;W[pk];B[fl];W[si];B[sf];W[se];B[gh];W[rf];B[lr];W[qq];B[pq]
;W[or];B[pr];W[os];B[oq]C[Well,

First you have to make COUTING a habit in your game, you cannot know who is winning or losing if you don't count frequently.

Second, you have to first make YOUR groups secure, afterwards you can think of attacking one of your opponents weak groups

Third, try to study some basic joseki, you lost wonderful chances of getting nice position just because you didn't punish your opponent for not playing the joseki.

Fourth, Try to think of the sequences in terms of Sente and Gote, it is hard in the beggining but you will get used to it and should improve your game

If I had to recomend any book to your improvement they would be:

1- 38 Basic Joseki ( Elementary Go series - Ishi Press)
2 - Tesuji (elementary Go series - Ishi Press)
3 - Positional Judgement (Ishi Press)

If I had to recomend only one it would be definetly - TESUJI

I think that you have a lot of potential to improve really fast, but sometimes you lose track of your game because you don't seem to count very frequently.

I hope I could have been of some help.

Good luck and Enjoy your games
