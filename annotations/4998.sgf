C[Hi, Myrcutio.

Thank you for letting me take a look at your game.  You wrote that you were worried early on about the scale of black's moyo and felt that you needed a moyo in the middle to win.  My initial impression is that you helped black build his moyo by playing reactively.  

Let's take a closer look.  I'll preface my comments with "M:"

Munisai79 on KGS];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[od];W[po];B[qo]
C[M:  Your opponent's move surprised me.  I was expecting a pincer, since it both attacks your stone and works well with the shimari on the top.  This territorial approach weakens the value of the shimari.]
;W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[pm]LB[pn:A]C[M:  I dislike this move.  I feel it should be played at (A) to make the solid connection since black is strong on both the top and bottom.  Then, if black neglects the bottom and chooses to pincer on the top, your position cannot be cut in half (see variations).]
;B[qi]LB[pj:A]C[M:  Black wants to fight.  I think the pincer stone should be closer, though.  As it is, white has some flexibility.  Perhaps black should play at (A)?]
;W[oq]C[M:  See variation.]
(;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[pp];B[qr];W[dj]LB[mq:A]C[M:  A big move ... but not an urgent one.  White must continue to play in the bottom right, at (A).  A black play there is just too painful.  Note the weakness because of the hanging connection.]
;B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[M:  I dislike this move because it lets black strengthen his stone and take the top.   Once he takes the top, he has made the large moyo that you feared later.  Furthermore, as you found out, your corner is not so secure.  See var for one idea that uses a pincer to keep black's moyo down.]
;B[fd];W[cg]LB[cf:A]C[M:  By splitting the difference between the corner and middle stones, white is playing too far from his corner.  Play (A).]
;B[cc]LB[jc:A]C[M:  This seems too early to me.  Black should be happy to play (A) to build his moyo.]
;W[cd];B[eb]
(;W[dc]LB[db:A]C[M:  I prefer the variation that uses (A).  With this line, white gets little in the corner.]
;B[db];W[cb];B[jc];W[mq]C[M:  Good.];B[cq]C[M:  IMO, black is hasty.  White will get a good result here.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[fq]LB[fr:A]C[M:  I prefer the double hane variation (A), as it either gives you sente and the corner or a great deal of thickness (your choice).  The bottom is already open on the right side, so it is of little value.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[dl]LB[fk:A]C[I read this position a long time, trying to find a way not to be reduced, i was fairly confident i could either block it entirely, or kill black if he grew too bold. either way, it seemed to work.

M:  If you can't read the kill ... don't try it.  It'll make for a fun chase, though.  I would probably start with (A).]
;W[cl]LB[gl:A]C[M:  This is a successful reduction for black.  You have traded a stone for a stone, and he can just jump out lightly to (A), perhaps.  You must threaten the capture the black stone on a large scale, and that means playing above it.]
;B[dk];W[fk]LB[ck:A][cl:1]C[M:  If you were going to play this move, it was better that you played it before (1).  As it is now, I would have played (A) to keep your forces connected.  Being cut as you were is painful.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bl];W[cm];B[bj];W[bi];B[fm];W[em]LB[ci:A]C[From this point on i was worried about the weakness at A.

M:  Yes, it is a real weakness.  If black gets any stronger in the area, white is in trouble.]

(;B[en];W[dm];B[jf]C[M:  Black should have continued to play in the center left.  This is another big but not urgent move.]
;W[fr]LB[ci:2][ep:1]C[M:  Yes, sente ... but not enough.  White has a weakness at (1) and a weakness at (2).  White will have to continue to play here to shore those weaknesses up.]
;B[dr];W[oj]C[M:  Nice moyo building, but I am still concerned about the left side.]
;B[jp]LB[ep:1][mr:A]C[I wasn't very sure how to handle this, i thought it was too deep, but i couldn't find a way to outright kill it.

M:  This is difficult.  Normally, my instinct would be to block any connection to the bottom right (A).  It seems too deep for black to jump out with even one jump, so he will have to live in place.  In this case, I fear he may do so because of the weakness at (1), but I can't read that far.

I don't think white can successfully resist this.]
(;W[ik];B[jm];W[in];B[kk]LB[im:A]C[I was surprised by this, i expected black to respond at A]

(;B[ij]LB[ln:A]C[M:  If one goes this route, I prefer black at (A).]

;B[sf];W[qh];B[lr]C[It hurt to deal with black 93, i couldn't find any way to cut it from K4 while keeping the N3 stones alive.  I had resigned myself to sacrificing them]
;W[mr];B[ms];W[kr];B[lq];W[kq];B[lp];W[kp];B[mo]C[I couldn't understand why black didn't capture my N3 group here, or at least Q5

M:  Just a mistake, I'm sure.];W[op];B[ko];W[jo];B[lo];W[ir]
;B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[mf]C[I was very paranoid about black's moyo at the top, it seemed unbearable to let black play here first, so i tenuki'd with my weak group at the bottom.

M:  Urgent first, then big.  Shore up your weak groups first. In this case, white seems fine ... but it's harder reading than I can do in a game.]

M:  Black lives, but it is close.  See var.  

M:  No further comments from here.  An interesting game.  In the future, please consider two things:
1.  Play the urgent moves before big ones.  (Your first priority is to defend your groups.)  You left many weak groups in this game, and it was fortunate that black did not capitalize.  
2.  Do not simply react to your opponent's moves.  Several of your early moves did not reflect the thought you demonstrated in the middle game.  Pause, look at the board as a whole, and decide how you wish to play.]
