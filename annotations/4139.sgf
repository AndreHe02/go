C[Dear reviewer,

I played this with White on KGS. This game is interesting due to the unusual opening played by Black. It puts positional judgement to a test, and of course I failed miserably. Had it not been for a last-minute blunder by Black, I would have lost this. I found some local tactical errors myself, but I guess you'll have some large scale comments to make !
Thank you for reviewing this.

Hans

Review by John Rae 4kyu IGS

Yes Black's late blunder just gave you the game.  However eliminating your "small tactical errors" would be enough to have won without theis blunder

There many points where you responded for no reason and failed to use sente to good effect. 

The opening was unusual but black did not take much advantage of your uncertainty. There are fewer large scale comments than you expect.

Overall white seems to me to play more soundly. Simply learning to use sente better and thinknig a litle longer term will lead to a fair bit of improvement]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[nq]C[J: OK black's trying to be a little unusual (I've not been on the receiving end of this either) Nothing to be worried about though, it fairly heavily emphasises the left bottom.

Options are to ignore it for now or to  play in the corner immediately.]
;W[dc];B[qn]C[J: So black challenges on a large scale

Again the options are to ignore it or to invade at 3-3 and worry about dealing with black's outside influence later.

I'd leave it. It will be a bit of a waste for black to make the corner solid with 3 moves so early in the game]
;W[ce];B[nn]C[this radiates influence across the board, so Black got the advantage

J: Well its a large corner but white can still invade.]
(;W[qh]C[I didn't want to allow -->variation, which enlarges Blacks moyo

J: The variation is certainly good for black, if white goes along with it. (see comments in variation)

This extension is not good. it is to far from Q16 or not far enough]
;B[db]C[J: While you are worrying about the black moyo black seems to be worying about your corner.

This sort of move is more usually used as an invasion It seems out of place here]
;W[cb];B[ec]
(;W[eb]C[J: OK but I prefer the variation];B[dd];W[cc];B[fb]
;W[da];B[fd]C[J: White has done nicely out of this exchange

Time to take sente and move elsewhere.]
(;W[gc];B[fc];W[ic]C[J: White's peep at G17 is not too close to black's stones. As a result the extension is narrow and J17 is a small move.

so much better to take sente instead of G17];B[gd]C[J: black uses the weak stone to gain a 2 stone wide shape to run from]
;W[hc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bf];B[de];W[cf];B[fa]
(;W[ea]C[J: Not necessary and a missed opportunity.

White does not need the eye. Black does not gain an eye.

Attack instead.];B[bc];W[ae];B[gg]C[J: compare this position to the alternatives on the earlier moves. See what E19 cost you.

The black group is strong and white has a small corner.];W[do]
C[Black was threatening to form a huge bottom moyo
(which he did anyway)];B[eo];W[en];B[ep];W[dn];B[ho]
(;W[mq]C[J: As the game shows this leaves whiter with a weak running group or( in the alternatives you found) the corner.


J: The objective is to reduce the moyo on the bottom, not the corner. (Because the 3-3 invasion is still left for later) I'd consider the alternatives]

Black has some strong walls but whgite seems OK];W[cj]C[This didn't even work

J: It looks a bit far from D6.

Its a fair enough (but low) extension from the strong corner. But that is not the important bit, its the three stones that are weak so you play to protect them.

Remeber the proverd play away from strength - your own or your opponent's]

It might be better sacrificing the 3 stones. Black is strong outside so white can do little with any outside stength of his own.]
