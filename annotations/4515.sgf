;B[dp]C[Hello zorg,
I think you (white) lost the game in the middle game. Your position was very bad then, but black was not able to use his advantage. You were still a little behind, when the endgame started, but you played a very good endgame, and black did not. So you caught up in the endgame. after the last move the game was won for you. Unfortunately you didnt play all necessary neutral points at the end and the KGS server (or maybe only the program CGoban I am using) adressed wrongly two points two your oponent. This turned the score in his favour.]

(;W[fe];B[gd];W[eg]C[Your position is cramped. The Joseki would have been better.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ic]C[This weakens your stones even more. I would rather try to settle the stones. But the outcome is hard to predict.]
;B[hc];W[id];B[ge];W[gf];B[bd]C[Right idea of black: Taking your option for a basis.  It is still the wrong move, as black ends in Gote. Black should play C16.]
;W[be]C[Good!];B[cd];W[hf]C[Very good! Black made a slack move and you used it to escape.]

(;W[rh]C[This is not good. Black lives anyway so you do not need to keep this stone. your stones become heavy.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[rn]
(;W[rm]C[Wrong direction!

Because of your strength above I would prefer to attach on the other side (with the exchange of q8 for q9 beforehand). I would rather give something in the corner away and capture the two stones above.]
;B[qm];W[qn];B[rl];W[ro];B[sm]C[Now blacks position is clearly better then yours. His stones are safe and your stones are heavy. Furthermore: The corner looks cramped.]
;W[qr];B[nn];W[bp]C[It is still more important to play M14. But your position is very difficult now. It is a miracle that the game became so close later.]
;B[cn];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[co]
;B[do];W[cr]C[This is an engame move. You do not need it to be alive. It is a big move, but still: Avoid playing endgame moves in the middle game.]
;B[fq]C[Oh! Black answers. Black answers your engame move with an endgame move. So: No damage done. (Black should have played N15).]
;W[gl]C[This invasion is to deep. It hurts your weak stones around P12. Something like M9 is better]
;B[jj]C[H11 would be harder on you];W[gj];B[jg];W[jl];B[lk]
C[blacks move is to slow. N15 is right.]
(;W[ho];B[lf];W[ki];B[ji];W[kg];B[kf];W[jh];B[ih];W[kj]C[Black should play L9. If white defends with L12, the black move J14 attacks two groups.]
;B[kh];W[kk]C[Good!];B[li]
(;W[lj];B[lh];W[mi];B[mj];W[nj];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl];W[ml]C[This is crude. Playing P10 directly leaves more options open. This way every aji will be played out.]

;W[qi]C[Did this white group deserve to survive? Was it good to keep it?

This one is hard to answer: It is clearly not a good result to live with such a group on such a small scale. But of course: If you would have lost this group, you have no chance to win the game anymore. So of course: Given your difficult position from a few moves back, it was good to keep that group.]
;B[ld];W[om];B[pl];W[rj]C[This is not sente! Black has got two eyes. Black should start attacking now.]

(;B[rk]C[Black is kind enough to answer.];W[lc]
(;B[kd];W[kc]
(;B[hq]C[Very defensive. Black is thick everywhere and should attack!
Because black missed all his chances to attack, the game is close again.]

(;W[kl]C[locally there is a better move: see variation. In fact this tesuji (M7) is worth learning. It can be applied very often.]
