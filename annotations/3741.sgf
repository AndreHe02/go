C[This is a game i played on the TOM website, i lost on the white side by 4.5. Can you point out any moves that i have stupidly made and maybe point out a much better move?
thanks.

xxc : hi
i'll do the review
i try to stay as simple as possible, maybe it is the answer to many of your questions ... simple, try to stay simple :)
go is already awfully difficult to handle, so no reason to make it harder

i'll follow the flow of the game, just pointing out "better" moves in my point of view]

xxc : here there is a difficult fight
the best you can do is searching for yourself each possible move, then keep only the best (those who gave a good result) and then try to understand why

i follow a lot of var ... and it's easy to follow a trap or to switch to an other result (ie b can let the A  to keep presure on the center and kill B)

b should have take a clear lead here earlier (C13)]

Were there any better ways for me to end the game? Like the procedure of my endings, please give me some useful tips, thanks!

xxc :ok :)
i hope comments will be usefull

my studie path (as it's clear you allready understand basics of the game)
1 opening paterns
2 corner paterns
3 end games
4 fight
and loop on that grabing just 1-2 things each part
each one may help you in other parts

about end game : just have a look at first var

found when end game might start is perhaps the key
from my point of view, end game have 2-3 stages
i'll try to show you on your game (sorry, but it is not really suitable for endgame studie)
move 35, 68 and 141all circles are endgame moves (the first to get there may gain something)

overall comment
nice game, not so much "stupid" moves as you say in your first comment :)
mistakes in fight reading (but it's a really hard part to master), and some slow moves
try to give an easy line to your game, make strong goup before fighting, extend before invade ...
play solid (not small), take care of your stone, first think about your own stones, are they all ok ? ... yes ... so can i attack something ? ... and it will be fine in your coming games

thank u])
