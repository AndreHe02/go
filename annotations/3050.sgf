;B[pd]C[uraken: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.];W[dd];B[dp]
;W[pp];B[qn];W[nq];B[pk]LB[rp:A][qq:B][qk:C][pj:D]C[dada: this move, though ok is unusual in this context. Either play the sequence A-B-C or play at D right away.]
;W[pf]
(;B[ph]LB[md:a]C[Is this move overconcentrated? Better Black at a?

dada: this move is ok. See variation.];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[od]
LB[rc:A]C[dada: not good. White can play at A immediatly and make a base in the corner.

This move is the first step of your downfall on the right side later on.]
;W[nf]
(;B[me]TR[od]C[Black trying to press and force White build a base on the right, in order to get territory on the upper side and influence to the center as well.

dada: actually, this is not good. But the reason is not this move, but the marked one. See variation]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[jc];B[nh]C[dada: the upper B group is not strong. But defending there would be awkward. So I understand the impuls of playing here.]
;W[qg];B[lc]TR[nh]LB[qh:A]C[dada: this is inconsequent. You played the marked stone to harrass the W group a little bit more. You have to follow up this move by playing at A now.]
;W[qi]LB[qh:A][qj:B]C[How to stop White´ invasion here?

dada: by stopping it one move earlier :o)

If you play here, there are two moves to consider: A and B]
;B[qh];W[rh]
(;B[qj]LB[rj:A]C[dada: "A" might be a good choice too. See variation]
;W[pi]
(;B[jq]TR[lc][od]SQ[pk][qj][qn]C[I guess, it is wrong for Black to tenuki here?

dada: the variation does not look that good either.
The problem was caused by the two marked moves. Now your group on the right is weak too. But the lower right corner is still open, so tenuki here is an option.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[og];B[ri];W[pg];B[oj]TR[ri]C[dada: small. You should regard the moves here as forcing moves and the stones as light. You got the marked stone in, which helps your group on the right. Tenuki now.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[cn]LB[cf:A]C[dada: W playing here first is big. Imagine the difference if you had played at 'A' first.]
;B[ck];W[pj]
(;B[ok]C[dada: does not look good to me. See variation instead.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj]
(;B[qp]LB[rp:A]C[dada: I don't like this move. You invested heavily into the center influence by giving up part of the right side. Now you should try to enclose it. See variation for an idea.

As the following moves show, at least you should have played at 'A', Attaching makes your enemy stronger. You don't want to do this in this area.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[Here Black neither wanted to give up the corner nor get closed into it.]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[qo]
(;B[po]LB[rp:A]C[dada: big mistake. Whatever happens, you have to play at 'A'. See variation.]
;W[rp]C[dada: ouch!];B[op];W[qp];B[oo]TR[pq][pr]C[dada: now your marked stones are dead.]
;W[mp]C[dada: and W moves into the center.

Black lost big here.];B[qr];W[rr];B[jo];W[nn];B[ro]C[This move was just a Black-out :-)]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[so];B[pm]C[dada: this hurts. Black must have been in tears at that point.]
;W[ln];B[lq]C[dada: what is the purpose of this move? Play elsewehre. This move does not accomplish anything.]
;W[lp];B[mq];W[np];B[ch]LB[ni:A]C[Black here ok, or should there be some defense move at the center, as the ladder at A is working no longer (which I forgot during the match)?

dada: playing on this side is ok, although if you extend you should play a real approach move to the top left corner. The ladde r is no problem.]
;W[nj]
(;B[nk]C[dada: no!! See variation.];W[mj];B[mg]TR[mi][nh]C[dada: the marked stones are not important. Why are you trying to save them? What do they contribute to your position?]
;W[li];B[mk]C[dada: again switching plans. So now you give up the stones anyway.]
;W[lj];B[kf]C[dada: this move is almost a pass play. You should run with your group on the right or gamble, tenuki and play on the left.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[kl];B[on];W[lm];B[km]C[dada: another Black-out?]
;W[ml];B[fd]C[dada: ok];W[nl];B[ol];W[mm];B[om];W[mh]C[dada: White captures an unimportant stone. This is a pass. Black should be grateful.]
;B[mf]C[dada; what? why? There are many other large points on the board. This move is very, very small.]
;W[ng]C[dada: another pass by White.];B[dc]LB[ff:A]C[dada: by attaching W will become stronger. An interesting idea would be to invade at 3-3 or jump to 'A' instead.]
;W[cc];B[cb]LB[ec:A]C[dada: this move has to be at 'A'. That way W gets the corner and B the upper side.]
;W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[cd];W[bc];B[bb]LB[bd:A]C[dada: playing at 'A' is more natural, as W loses the atari forcing move.]
;W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[ac]C[Black did not mean to be shut in, originally...

dada: well, why did you play like this then?];W[ef];B[fb]LB[hc:a]
C[Better Black at a?

dada: 'A' is too timid. If you are unsure, play elsewhere, e.g. on the lower left side.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[ea];B[hd]LB[gf:A]C[dada: should be at 'A'];W[je]
;B[jd]C[dada: again you are attaching the stones you are trying to attack. Attaching makes them strong!]
;W[id];B[kd];W[he];B[ic];W[ie];B[jb]LB[hc:A]C[Black did not see the double atari at A.]
;W[hc];B[kc]LB[ib:A]C[dada: better to play at 'A' instead.]
;W[ib];B[gd];W[jc];B[de]C[Black now constantly tried killing one of the white groups.]
;W[df];B[ic];W[gb];B[gf];W[ge];B[ia];W[jc];B[fe];W[ee];B[ic]
;W[hb];B[jc];W[fa];B[ff];W[ig];B[gh]LB[fh:A]TR[ig]C[dada: should be at 'A'. After the marked W stone the W group can easily connect to the W stones below. So your aim has to be the W group on the left.]

;W[hi];B[ei];W[dh];B[di];W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[ek]C[dada: strange move. Does not accomplish much.]
;B[ij];W[ik]
(;B[hk]LB[jj:A]C[dada: ?? why didn't you play at 'A' instead? See variation.]
;W[jj];B[fj]LB[gm:A][hm:B][dl:C][dm:D]C[dada: no. If you play a safety move here, then play something like 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D']
;W[em];B[dl];W[el]C[dada: what did you gain from this exchange?]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[cp];W[dk];B[cl];W[eo];B[fn]C[Black trying to prevent White from living - or better trying to shut the lower edge?

dada: forcing here is ok, if you follow it up with closing off the lower edge.]
;W[en];B[gp]LB[fp:A]C[dada: this should be at 'A'.];W[ep];B[eq]
;W[fq];B[er]C[dada: yep. White breaks up the lower side. Although: the W group is pretty weak and has no eyes yet. The question is: are you sure you can kill it? if not, then you lost big with this all-or-nothing strategy.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[go];B[gn];W[gl];B[hl];W[gm];B[hn];W[hm];B[il]
;W[im];B[jm];W[in];B[ho];W[io];B[ko];W[hp];B[hq];W[fm];B[ip]
;W[bm]LB[bo:A]C[Can Black prevent White from getting two eyes here?

dada: yes. just play at 'A' next.]
(;B[cj];W[bo];B[bp];W[an];B[fk]LB[bl:A]C[dada: as W lives here, better to play 'A'. This gives you more points.]
;W[bl];B[co];W[cm];B[bk];W[al];B[ap];W[ao];B[jl];W[mr];B[lr]
;W[fo];B[hp]LB[fr:A]C[dada: I think playing at 'A' is larger than saving these stones.]
;W[kp];B[jp];W[nr];B[fr];W[rb];B[ra];W[ke];B[le]LB[kq:A]C[dada: small. There are bigger moves, e.g. 'A']
;W[ne];B[nd];W[ls];B[jr]LB[kr:A]C[dada: 'A' is the correct way to play.]
;W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[kr];W[ms];B[ak];W[jk];B[jf]LB[af:A][ag:B]
C[dada: dame. Instead play e.g. at 'A' or 'B'];W[ki];B[da];W[lo]

;B[ae]C[dada: why start the ko?];W[ad];B[ga]C[dada: not a good ko threat.]
;W[ha];B[ja]C[dada: proof];W[ae];B[dj]C[dada: no more points on the board. Should end the game now.]

[sf][sg][sh][si][sj][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[dada: so Black lost by 11pts. 

Despite the problems on the right side, Black still had a good game, as White played "pass" moves and small moves every now and then. The real problem was hanging on to unimportant stones, the decisive error in judgement in the upper left corner (living small instead of going for the side), attaching stones you are attacking, and small endgame plays. Going for the kill on the left (although it looks possible) is always a dangerous gamble. Better to make territory instead of all-or-nothing plays. 

I suggest that you look more at the center of the board and try to determine where you can make territory or where your opponent can make territory. And then play there. And don't save unimportant, useless stones. And don't attach weak stones you would like to attack. Attaching makes the enemy stronger.]

(;AB[rc][nd]AE[od]TR[rc]LB[od:A][nd:B][me:C]C[dada: if you compare this diagram (stone at A moved to B) you could play the marked stone instead of playing at C. White has no base in the corner and has to run out even more. That way you easily make territory on the top.

Rule of thumb: keep your opponent weak and running and you will make territory effortlessly.]

But that means you lose sente and White gets to play along the top first. So your move in the game looks ok.]
