C[I played White, and won.
I would specifically like to know where :
- I was not sente (or not enough)
- I made wrong shape or allowed my opponent tu put me in bad shape
- I made improper use of my strenght.

Thanks in advance

C[A Black San-ren-sei should be in the back of your mind.  If you aren't going to utilize the D4 stone by making a shimari or chinese type opening, then best to play a 3-3 or 4-4 point instead.]
;B[pj];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no]C[This looks like a Cho-Chikun game]

(;W[oq];B[pq]C[When White as a low strong stone in the lower left, then protectiong the cut is the best move]

(;W[jq];B[mq]C[Q : I'm not sure this is very productive for B, even with a follow-up at N5. Is this correct ?

This is a 1 point loss, not horrible, but Black could have simply just pushed at N5 rather then cut, so this also removes aji for later as it settle the position.  If the cut is not a threat for white, then white can push through at P4 with no fear.  Black settling this so early will ruin his moyo.]
;W[lq];B[mr];W[lr];B[mo];W[lp]C[Black did okay here, white looks very cramped, but Black didn't gain much for it, his moyo did not grow by much.]
;B[mj];W[jc]C[Probably should be the 4th line,  Black is probably thinking about capping this stone to build is moyo even bigger.]
;B[cj];W[cl];B[df]
(;W[ch]C[This because I have the ladder on both sides

This is attacking, but without a purpose.  What is your goal here?  To capture some stones?  To split Black, to take Territory?  This is a small area]
;B[ej]C[So many weak groups.   White has 3 weak groups, white Black has 2, this fight is unreasonable for white]

(;W[eh]C[This is not an important stone.  It can connect to C8 or D16 or run away,  with 3 options its not proper to run away.  D16 can be crushed into the corner or lose it entirely.  C8 has the same problems.  White should just take territory and bide his time.]
;B[ff];W[fd];B[fh]
(;W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[qf]C[Q :Is this correct ?
Any other thoughts to reduce B ?

Count the score, White is leading, black just has a moyo.

Black isn't that big yet.  Just approach at O17 is bigger and safer for white.  What can always attach at R10 to invade, because N10 is too far away to help in the fight.  A move around E7 would make a big moyo for White to compare with Blacks.  there is no need to make yet another weak group.]

(;B[pf]C[Black helps white accompish his goal though.  Black should attack white here]

I don't have the correct sequence that leads to a ko at best, and neither do I have the refutation of B moves when going astray.

Any thoughts ?

The corner is bigger, but a source of many ko threats, so figting ko is a sure way to lose.]
