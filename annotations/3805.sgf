Andreas: Dear Reviewer, thank You in Advance for the review.

This game was played in the 2nd Season of the German federal go league, league 2. I made a serious blunder in the opening, which gave black tremendous thickness along the lower right. In the late middle game i captured a few important cutting stones, which took the pressure from my weak group, and due to slack endgame by my opponent, i managed to catch up. The Jigo felt like a win to me, because i was far behind during the middle game. I would like comments mainly about the middle game, which is my biggest weakness.]
;B[qd]C[A: Black is Christian Haberbosch, EGF 2 Dan, playing for Freiburg 1]
;W[dc]C[A: White is me, Andreas Teckentrup, 1 Dan EGF, playing for Trier 1]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[de];W[ce];B[dd]C[A: Nadare. I dont know the joseki very well.]
;W[cd];B[ec]C[
janr: If white does not know sufficient variants of the joseki, he can play c17, which is simple and ususally sufficient]

(;W[cf];B[cc]C[This seems to be a Mistake by black, ive never seen this atari before the sequence of B d14 W d13. What is the best way to punish this mistake?]
;W[db];B[bc]LB[df:A]C[
janr: Black can not save his two stones.  It is better to push once at A and look to use the aji later.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bb]C[i pushed twice because i didnt want black to play f18 in sente.]
;B[eg]LB[dh:A]C[A: Should i answer this move?

Playing at A can not be bad, but tenuki is ok too I think];W[od]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[lc]C[A: i didnt extend one further because my opponent already had some influence on the left]
;B[cg];W[co];B[bd]LB[df:A]C[A: could my opponent have captured my c15 stones with better moves?


janr: it is difficult to capture white here, as black is not very strong.

For both sides, A is an important point]
(;W[bg]LB[df:A]C[It is important for white to push once at A.  It creates cutting points for black, and avoids the variants shown for the case black plays there immediately]

(;B[ch]C[
Black too misses an opportunity to play at the important point.
Even if white answers correctly, the situation gets a ko I think (?).]
;W[bh];B[ci]LB[cb:C][be:B][df:A]C[
The variant is better in two ways:
1) white creates cutting points in black shape,
2) white fills a black liberty at B instead of C, making the black move at A gote.]

(;W[cb];B[df];W[be];B[jp];W[qn]C[A: Approaching here seems to be common sense to me]
;B[qk];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[po];W[op];B[qo]C[
janr: maybe the ladder is better, i dont know]
(;W[qr]C[A: Since my opponent didnt play the atari, this seemed to be the best way to play here to me.]
;B[pn]C[A: i obvously should captured the Q3 stone now.];W[hp]
C[A: The following sentence was a catastrophe for me, and i think it could have been even worse.]
;B[oq]C[
janr: White should get in an alarmed state now and stop this one-street-to-death sequence as soon as possible.]

;W[ir];B[ip]
(;W[lr]LB[lo:B][hq:A]C[
janr: I think it is clear now that if black plays B, he wins the capturing race.

playing at A instead is a way to reduce losses.  It makes a bit of territory, reduces blacks liberties to 3, and leaves some more aji in whites stones.]
;B[lo];W[mr];B[jr];W[kr];B[mo];W[nr];B[no];W[or];B[oo]C[A: at least i came out with sente, but the result is horrible for me]
;W[nj]C[A: trying to reduce. going even deeper seemed to risky to me, and there was a decent follow-up at q10.]
;B[hr];W[js];B[eq]C[A: my opponent captures the h4 stone in sente, but strengthens my corner.
janr: just connecting at h3 seems simpler.];W[ep];B[dr];W[er]
;B[fq];W[cr];B[dp];W[cq];B[gp]
(;W[eo]C[janr: maybe it's too small to play this move now, especiaaly as white is a bit behind.]
;B[pi]C[A: b defends on the 4th line. I am not satisfied with the outcome of the next few moves, so i would like to see some alternatives.]
;W[nf];B[ng]
(;W[mg]C[janr: the hane builds white influence (which is not so useful).
It may be better to just run out white the reducing stone.]
;B[mh];W[og];B[nh];W[of];B[qh];W[lg];B[ki]C[A: B clearly gets too much, i made something wrong]
;W[ik]C[A: desperate measures, i am far behind];B[gn];W[kk]
;B[dn];W[do];B[jj];W[im];B[jk]C[

janr: black strengthens white too much.  Attack from a distance.]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[km];B[ll];W[lm];B[ml]C[

janr: I think black can play hane.];W[mm];B[nl];W[gl]
(;B[dl]C[
janr: black is trying extremely hard to capture white. It may be better to give white 2 points and make some territory elsewhere.]

C[A: better at k15?];B[kf];W[kg];B[jf];W[fh];B[kd]C[A: this surprised me. blocking in the g13 area seemed move valueable to me.

(;B[bm];W[cm];B[pr];W[ps]C[A: If black plays the hane at s3, he wins]

(;B[fr];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]C[A: I think this move was worth 12 points]
