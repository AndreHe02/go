C[[A\] Hi, In this game I played Black and lost by resignation. See specific questions insde; I would appreciate all comments, but especially on the early and middle parts.

Thanks!

-H- Hi! I am your reviewer. Thanks for submitting your game to the GTL.

;W[pb]C[[A\]: This move is hardly being played by professionsals, yet I experience it a lot in my games. I know the more common continuation is L16, leaving the option to invade at R17 later.  What is the best answer for Black?

-H- Just play R17 and be happy. White has then lost the option of invading R17.]
;B[qc]C[[A\] This is supposed to take away the possibility to establish a base in the corner from White. But...

-H- Good move. Bad exchange for White.];W[ic]C[[A\] M17 feels alone now... White build territory on the top left, and M17 is under attack.

-H- So is the white group, so there is no need to worry yet.]
;B[le];W[ng];B[ph];W[mh]
(;B[je]C[[A\] I am not sure about this move. What is better?

-H- I feel that this is too fearful. Black could go to J15 for more speed. Of course, you have to determine what to do about the peep L16 first (see variation).]
;W[kg]
(;B[hd]C[-H- Have you looked at what happens if White pushes up and cuts? I've shown some possibilities as a variation.]

(;W[hc]
(;B[gd]C[-H- Perhaps you don't want to give White his territory so easily. Then, you could play at J13 now instead, with H16 giving some protection to the keima.]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[id]C[-H- This move seems unnecessary to me. Most likely it is aji keshi, since White might want to use that shape differently later, e.g. playing K14, J15 or K16.]
;B[ie]
(;W[ec]
(;B[gf]C[-H- Too slow, in my opinion. H15 can't be cut yet, and the three stones are disposable, anyway. Better try and put more pressure on the white group.]

(;W[qb]C[-H- This crawl is almost like passing at this stage. It is better to seek shape and development in the center.]

(;B[rb]C[-H- Answering here is very slow, again! Your right side is not really threatened.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[df]C[[A\] This is a big point - but I do not know how Black could have prevented it.

-H- I think that the lower side is bigger now, but I may be wrong.]
;B[ih]C[-H- Now it is painful to answer again. Do you see how G14 seems almost useless now? Consider that the three stones around G16 can be thrown away, because they have been answered by White below.]
;W[kb]
(;B[kc]C[[A\] I would have preferred M18, but then how would I answer L16?

-H- Then don't play here. Perhaps later the opportunity for M18 arises. For now, be happy that White answered a move like J12, that helps the center, with a move like L18, on the second line. If he plays M18 or L16 later, even better: you get another move in a more important part of the board.]
;W[lb];B[mc];W[mb];B[ck]
(;W[qn]C[-H- Unusual direction. Normally, White wants to approach from the more open side, and here it would also help develop D4.]

(;B[ql]C[-H- In such a situation, where Black has a stone around Q9 or Q10 in place, normally you want to prevent a slide by attaching at R5 first]
;W[on];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq]
(;B[rr]C[-H- With O4 high, the extension is important, so you should consider L3 now.]
;W[rm]C[-H- White is very determined to live small.];B[rl];W[lq]
C[[A\] Again...

-H- Now you see how L3 would have made it much easier for you. But don't be afraid here: White is still unsettled on the right side.]
;B[mo];W[nm];B[kp]
(;W[kq]C[-H- I think this is a mistake by White, because the group becomes heavy.]

(;B[jp]C[-H- I think that this might give the territory to White too easily. However, Black gets thick, and has a nice target for attack on the right side.]

(;W[ir]C[-H- Why on the second line again? White can push once more, then jump. Now White will not even get much territory for letting Black the outside.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[gq];W[iq]C[-H- Again, a useless push.];B[ip]
C[-H- This exchange helps Black.];W[fr];B[fq];W[er]C[-H- This is quite catastrophal for White.]

(;B[cn]C[[A\] I considered also C12, but White would play C or C7 and the corner is very big. May be D7 better?

-H- Well, after White gave Black such a nice wall in exchange for 6 points of territory, you could consider using it, e.g. attacking on the right side.]
;W[dn]
(;B[co];W[do];B[dm];W[em]
(;B[dl]C[-H- C9 seems too close. See variation.];W[go];B[ho]
;W[oi]
(;B[pi]C[-H- At least think about the alternatives first! You don't want to let White eliminate his weakness. See variation.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[nk]C[[A\] The territory Black was trying to build in the center has been reduced a lot

-H- There was no territory in the centre envisionable. What you have actually lost is a huge opportunity to attack White. White was allowed to eliminate his weakness almost for free. Now, Black's lower wall seems to be in danger of becoming an eyeless dragon.]

(;B[mm]C[[A\] C12 better I think

-H- I can understand that you feel the need to do something for your lower group, but I am sure that it is not in direct danger. Also, White has not too much to gain from attacking it. C12 seems good.]
;W[ci]C[[A\] Good punishment...]
(;B[dg]C[-H- The wrong point for invasion.];W[cg];B[ef];W[cf]
C[-H- With just two moves, Black ensures that White gets his territory.]
;B[di]C[-H- This looks like an attempt for sabaki, but I believe that the black group is thick enough. A move around O2 or B3 would be huge now.]

(;B[il]C[-H- Not so big.];W[jk]C[-H- Bad idea for White, I think.]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[ki]C[[A\] although Black has captured K9, I think White slightly leads:
- Top left: ~43, Bottom left ~15, Bottom right ~3, Capture: 1, Komi 0.5 = 62.5

Black:
- Top right: ~28, Center: ~22, Left ~8 = 58

White also has sente which is very important now.

-H- Sente is always important.];W[ek]C[[A\] Start of a good sequence taking advantage of sente]
;B[fk];W[cp];B[dk];W[gk];B[gj];W[gl];B[hj];W[pr]
(;B[qr]C[-H- Consider the variation beginning with P2 here.]
;W[oq];B[po];W[pn];B[nr]C[[A\] Trying to prevent the connection but of course does not work

-H- I don't know what to say - in the following few moves, Black deliberately and obviously throws away around 5 points plus his sente.]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[lr];W[mp]C[[A\] White's lead now is significant];B[no];W[ig]
;B[mf];W[kh];B[jh];W[hh]C[[A\] A over play I think by White - he could easily secure the win with O14. Black now has some chances - but White defends well after all and wins also this way]
;B[ji];W[jg];B[nf]C[-H- This is Black's chance. I will show some moves for Black in the following part that perhaps take the black lack of liberties in the centre better into account.]
;W[sl];B[li];W[mg]
(;B[oj];W[mi];B[nj];W[mj]
(;B[nn]C[-H- This move doesn't seem helpful, since Q8 almost guarantees an eye for White.]

;W[hf];B[he];W[lh];B[ij];W[lf]C[[A\] Securing life and wins. End of my comments.

-H- Yes, especially since Black even has to answer on the right side again.]
;B[me]C[-H- Connecting is four points, protecting at T9 is ten or more.]
;W[ke];B[jd];W[rk];B[pe]
(;W[oc];B[qk];W[rj];B[ri];W[ra];B[rc];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp]C[-H- Black seems to play in a rather thick style, which I like. However, to make your thickness work, you have to pay close attention to the opponent's weaknesses and attack them when the opportunity arises; this game was mostly decided by White linking up at O9. Also, don't be afraid to invade when the situation demands it; D13 was the second big mistake. It is also important to play efficiently. Keep an eye on which stones can be thrown away (e.g. you lost a move with G14), and don't play endgame before the endgame (S18...). Also, when you feel behind, you have to calculate better, not worse than before - O2 might be excusable, but M2 is not. And the last point - I still have no idea where you saw potential territory in the centre. Use your thickness to attack, by driving weak stones against your walls!

White's style is difficult to describe - the most notable characteristic seems to be searching for life immediately and without regard to a consistent strategy. He got very lucky that Black in this game seemed to see only his own weaknesses, so that he could win by grabbing some territory. There are lot of bad habits that hinder your play, like pushing into keima that can't be cut (J16, J3), crawling on the second line (R18, S3, S7, L18, J2). You too, even more than Black, have to pay attention to the efficiency of your stones. Try to make them work together - you don't have to destroy all enemy territory, you just need to have a bit more than him in the end.]
