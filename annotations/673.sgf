 This game both players concentrated on moyo/territory building.

Several critical points were missed for killing or puuting severe pressure on the opponent.

W closed the game out by exploiting a crtical weakness in Bs strucutre(c15). B failed to spot Ws weakness. (n18).

I felt W was more "in control", but both players should consider seeking more severe moves. Groups tended to die by accident rather than design. :-)

IMHO its  important  to avoid an attitude of "I'll ignore your weaknesses if you ignore mine", and that single moves can win/lose games.]

It is not a very good threat or anything, but I thought it was
too good a move for white to get.


B should protect C15]

;B[rb];W[pc];B[rd]C[I am not sure about 29. Is that good or should it be at R16 instead
to stop white from next move?


Yes
Both players should note value of g13
Even if B omits rs16  for g13, he protects mstones and gets nice moyo]
;W[od];B[pe]C[I didn't like playing Q15. It was small but I thought it was
neccessary.

Perhaps W reasons that Gstones are alive and therefore efficient to leave them.
Problem is that W will have to take gote to save Gstones after B g11....
B gains profit (strength) in sente.]
(;B[ql]C[I decided to defend the upper side due to the group M17-M11.
Is that correct?


Right idea and finishes R moyo
  but W has G11];W[on];B[ol];W[nq];B[qp]C[Is R4 the best move to stay alive in the  corner?

r4 is fine
But after p8 B should attack W with  n18 for instance
B might even live in corner as well!];W[qo];B[cq]C[I was getting scared of the larger territory. I thought if I
got rid of part of it I would win.


c3 isn't unreasonable
Territories are pretty equal (if we forget about Wc15 and Bn18 :->)

I prefer f3 to reduce Ws moyo];W[dq]C[W makes nice wall and moyo]

Must address Ws moyo];W[km]TR[ni][mb]C[Excellent
Thisputs W strong position to win game, but B should try to kill   Now g11 /n18 is screaming]

(;B[gj];W[hl];B[dl]C[I played 67 to get some life to the string C10-H10 and to make
sure C12 wasn't going to connect. Should I have done anything
else instead?

C10-H10 is strong  something like h15];W[dm]

right corner and if I had stopped the invasion in another way

end. Usually I stake out large territories in the beginning but
loose them in the end.    Please feel fre to comment the other player as well as other
moves in the game.    Thanks in advance.  Best regards / Mans Ullerstam

Corner was worth 40 pts or so, and would only have lost 12 pts if W just got seki.
So perhaps I've been overly critical of Bs play up until the corner accident!!
