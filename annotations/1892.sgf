C[This is a game between me and my brother, we both have been playing a while and arent too sure about our ranks, which is why I'm requesting a review..  Also if u see any specific mistakes either of us have made that would have made the game end differently please comment.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Carey: Please include the final result of the game in your opening comments next time.  

After reviewing your game,  I would estimate your ranks to be in the 21-24k range]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[oc];B[pe]LB[oe:A]C[Carey: A is a better extension, helps to wall off larger territory.]
;W[co];B[nd];W[qk];B[qo];W[qh];B[nc]LB[kc:B][ci:A][fp:D][jp:C]
TR[oc]SQ[qo][pq]C[Carey: This is generally a small move.  Sure black captures that one peice and the corner, but all these other moves would have been better.  A would have broken white's moyo, like white did to Black last turn.  B would have been a three point extension, and it still would have been the marked stone to live.  And C would have been an extension from a shimari (marked square), which is a strong move as well.  C would of also opened up an attack on D]
;W[jc];B[ce];W[fd];B[ep]TR[ce]C[Carey: I would have extended from the marked stone.  It's clearly in danger]

(;W[dq]C[Carey: Not a good move on white, white is doing exactly what black whats them to do.  As you can see by the result, black gets a very large framework on the bottom side.  See variation]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[iq];W[od];B[oe];W[nb]C[Carey: white is clearly trying to escape since they can't live.

Black's plays the next few moves are too timid.  See variation]

(;B[lc];W[mb];B[kc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[jb];W[rc];B[rd];W[qc]
;B[ic];W[cd]C[Carey: This move is a "thank you" move.  Black was already weak, but white just made a move to make him stronger, a move he wanted to make anyway]
;B[de];W[gc]LB[ci:A][di:B]C[Carey: White is already safe in the corner.  A or B would have been significantly better.]
;B[ci]C[Carey: See how black took the point that white should have?]
;W[ne]C[Carey: Excellent place to cut];B[pg];W[me];B[ph];W[qi]
;B[ie]LB[jd:A]C[If black was trying to protect the top side, while abandoning the two stones, A would have given him better shape and reduced the Aji (bad feeling) of the white stone in his framework.]
;W[mc];B[oj];W[qm]LB[cl:A][jp:B]C[Carey: This move is not completely necessary.  It may guaruntee life, but white could have lived without it.  A would have been a more efficient extension, and B would have been a great moyo-reducing move.  If black]
;B[cm]LB[ck:B][cl:A]C[Carey: This extension was probably too far.  A would have been safer.  This move leaves room for a strong attack at B]
;W[er]LB[jp:A][lq:1][nq:B]C[Carey: Again, there are bigger fish to fry.  This move is small compared to an attack on the lower side either at A or B.  If Black plays at 1, white is going to have a very hard time reducing black's territory.]
;B[ff]C[Carey: Good capping move];W[ng];B[pi];W[om];B[ld];W[md]
C[Carey: This is another "thank you" move.  Black made white have a stronger wall, while black is left with an emptry triangle.]
;B[mp]LB[lp:A][lq:B]C[Carey: A or B would have been a better extension from a shimari.]
;W[gq]
(;B[be]C[Carey: This was a very good move by white, and black was very wrong to ignore it.  See variation]
;W[bd];B[lj];W[ck];B[bo]LB[bn:A]C[Carey: I don't see the purpose of this move. White should defend at A, attacking two stones at once]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[bn];B[bm];W[ek];B[an];W[bp];B[fm];W[gk];B[gp]
;W[fq];B[ei];W[hl];B[io]C[Carey: Black should be worrying about the weak white gruop connecting to the right side.]
;W[kk];B[kj]LB[lk:A]C[Carey: A would have been better];W[km]
;B[im];W[il];B[ml];W[dj];B[di];W[ko];B[kp]LB[mn:A]C[A would have been better.  It would have left that long white group without eye space]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[no];B[op];W[jj];B[ji];W[ij];B[hb];W[gb];B[rn]
;W[qq];B[rm]C[Carey: Black should have responded to white's move, as the result clearly shows.]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[pr];B[or];W[nq];B[np];W[oq];B[pp];W[nr];B[pl]
;W[qf];B[ql]LB[pk:A]C[A would have been better,  play R8.  The white stones would have been separated, ,and the center group would have been in trouble again]
;W[re];B[jm];W[jl];B[ll];W[kl];B[fl];W[fk];B[gi];W[gn];B[go]
;W[fn];B[en];W[bl];B[bj];W[al];B[jo];W[el]LB[am:A]C[White A would have made the white group in the center live unconditionally.  Alternatively, Black A would have made it hard for white to live]
;B[em];W[fo];B[fp];W[eo];B[do];W[dp];B[gm];W[dn];B[hn];W[do]
;B[hm];W[am]C[Carey: Many moves later, the most important point is taken.]
;B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[qe];B[pd];W[qg];B[of];W[rk];B[sg];W[rf]

;B[ln];W[pk];B[ol];W[lg];B[pj]C[Carey: This is a very small move for Black, they should be worrying about white's top right group pushing into his framework.]
;W[qj];B[kn]LB[jd:2][ge:3][jg:1][kn:A][lo:B]C[A and B are miai for black (if white plays one, black plays the other).  When a situation like this appears, it's best to play elsewhere.  

1, 2 and 3 (in that order) are the best moves I see right now for Black]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[ir];B[jr];W[hq];B[ip];W[hr];B[ga];W[fa];B[ha]
;W[ec];B[lb]C[Carey: The last few moves were the last moves you are supposed to make in the game  There is still a vast amount of territory to be faught over in the center.  Whoever can play there first gets the best results]
;W[gg];B[fb];W[ea];B[ih];W[gf];B[ge]LB[fe:A]C[A would have been better.  White would have connected, but Black would have pure profit on the left side.]
;W[ef];B[fg];W[ee];B[eb];W[da];B[db]C[Carey: This sequence is an obvious mistake by black]
