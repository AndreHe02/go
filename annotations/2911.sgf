C[Hi!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[kc];W[jq]C[This was a bad move for W, because it was out of order. First, the sen-ren-sei should be made, by playing at C or D-10, before you extend. By playing K-3 here, B is given a chance to invade the left side, and break it up. Also, if W wants to play more aggressively, I think he could approach the bottom right corner, to break up the right side.]
;B[qo];W[cj]C[Good move, now its like you made the sen-ren-sei earlier, and played K-3.]
;B[ej];W[dl];B[ci]C[I think that B could also treat E-10 as kikashi (a forcing move), and make an extension on the right side (Q-10 ) instead.]

(;W[dj]C[I'm concerned with pushing up and cutting here, because it makes B stronger on the other side, and makes it easier for him to attack the two W stones in the upper left. I would consider playing D-10 instead.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[bj];W[ek]C[Why not block with B-9?]
;B[ck]C[B can now dig out more of the left side, and W is left with bad shape.]
;W[dk];B[dg]C[I would make a soild connection instead, at D-12. This forces W to get stronger by playing E-14]
;W[bk]C[This is a small move. Taking care of the two stones in the top left is urgent, by playing E-14. Now, B can begin attacking.]
;B[ce]C[I think that this is a thin move, as W can cut right through.  Instead, I'd play E-14, which is a strong hit on the head of the W stone, and helps B get some breathing room by escaping.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ef];B[ee];W[fg]C[Although W does enclose the B group, B gains so much in the top left corner. I would consider E-15 instead of E-14 as another possibility, to prevent B from getting all of that territory so easily.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[fq];B[jp];W[kp];B[fj];W[fh];B[gj];W[jo];B[fe];W[bh]
;B[qi]C[I think B has the right idea, but this feels flat (there's an imbalance of the 3rd and 4th lines). I'd prefer to have it on the 4th line instead, like Q-10.]
;W[cc]C[Its going to be hard for w to live in the upper left now.]
;B[db];W[bd];B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bf];W[cg];B[cb]C[I'm not so sure that B needs another move to kill the group.]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[je]C[Nice attacking move. As for reducing the top, a move like H-15 would be good.]
;W[mc]C[This move doesn't do much for W. He should jump out instead, with N-13.]
;B[oc]C[B should be more aggressive, and attack W from below, with M-14, etc.]
;W[lf]C[This is too slow.  N-13, is faster, and can't be cut, unless the opponent's surrounding stones are strong enough.]
;B[jg];W[lh];B[ji];W[lj];B[jk];W[ll]C[I think W came out of this with a much better result than B. B didn't gain much from this, while W is now in the center, and facing the right side. It's going to be much easier for W to reduce or invade now.]
;B[mo]C[This is a thank-you move for W, it forces him to close that gap between the two groups, and B doesn't gain anything out of it. B should hold off on this until a better time.]
;W[km];B[gl];W[gn];B[of]C[This is a good idea, or P-11, making miai of the two sides.]
;W[oh]C[I think this is too light. W should play either Q-12 or 13, or reduce the right side, because it's larger.]
;B[oj]C[Nice move.];W[ol];B[ql];W[pk]C[Too small, as this isn't worth much. I would worry more about the other side.]
;B[oi];W[nh]C[It would be great if W could play Q-12 instead, but because of the aji left in W's connection, its dangerous.]
;B[ph];W[qk]C[With the peep at N-9 looming, W needs to strengthen his connection here with O-9, etc.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[nl]C[This doesn't cut W simply, I think N-8 would be better.]
;W[nm];B[ok];W[ml];B[pl];W[nk];B[pn];W[mi];B[hh];W[gf]C[This is a thank-you move for B. I would take a big point elsewhere, or, if you want to play locally, peep at J-14 first.]
;B[ge];W[hf];B[ie];W[ig]C[Another thank-you move for B. This doesn't help W.]
;B[ih];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[oq];W[mp];B[no];W[ip];B[im];W[jn]
;B[fl];W[fm];B[hn];W[ho];B[gm];W[fn];B[in]C[This is a small move, B should play elsewhere.]
;W[on];B[oo];W[nb];B[ob];W[lb]C[I would make the hane and connection at P-19 first, then work on the other side.]

;B[pg];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[el];W[oa];B[pa];W[na]C[I would come back and block at E-7, even if it means letting B capture the O-19 stone. Its definitely worth more.]

C[I would also think about P-1 or O-17.];B[fk];W[nc];B[mm];W[pf]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[rf]C[To keep things simple, B should play S-13.]
;W[qg];B[rg]C[B should play R-12, and end this quickly.];W[qh]
;B[pi];W[rh];B[ri];W[sg];B[si];W[sh];B[nn];W[nl];B[lm]C[Hane at S-9, to prevent losing more points.]

[sq][ar][qr][rr][sr][as][qs][rs][ss]C[Overall, I think the turning points in the game were the big corner in the top left, and the fighting on the right side (B's bottom right corner looks large too). Because W's connection wasn't totally solid, B was able to cut off some stones. W was also too light in reducing.

Anyway, I hope that you enjoyed this review, and found it helpful.

Thanks!
