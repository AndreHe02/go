C[SS: We have played  twice before and I won  both after budo  resigned. He got drawn  into fighting to close  and I out manouvered  him.   I'm not sure where  I could have played  better strategically and  I have some questions  about some corner  fights.

Otakung: Your big mistake is not attack when you have many influnce and it's sente. In the middle game you must think about attack and defense weak group, the move that get profit but not attack or defense weak group is endgame move that can play after middle game.]
;B[qq];W[dd];B[qc];W[dp];B[hp]C[SS: I wasn't sure how  to respond to this. I  concluded that no direct  response was  necessary and played  elsewhere.

;W[nq];B[po];W[fk]LB[fm:a][dj:b]C[SS: This probably  wasn't great. I was  thinking black would  respond at a to keep  connected allowing me  to follow up at b.

Otakung: You should answer at O5 or anywhere that jump to the center. This move doesn't help anything.]

[il:c][cl:d]C[SS: I couldn't decide  where to play at this  point. I considered  extending to a,b or c, or  sliding under with d. I  opted for trying to  reduce black  at the top because it  seemed to be most  sente.

Otakung: This move is good, attack the weak group, but you must be careful at the cutting point at D15.]

C[Otakung: It's not the big point. There is a weak group on the top or you can attack the top right group. This is only endgame move.]

;B[dm];W[el]C[Otakung: D6 is better.];B[dn];W[dk]LB[co:a]C[SS: This was just  stupid. I think I just  missed the marked  stone or something.  There was an urgent  move at a.

Otakung: Yes , C5 is urgent.];B[ek];W[dj]C[SS: trying to rescue  this was futile.]
