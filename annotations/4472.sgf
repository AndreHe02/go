C[Hello! I think my opening has improved since last game. But my middle game looked so bad. Hope to get some help :\]

Chris: hey dimitri, your opening has indeed improved! well done! whats missing now seems to be experience and calmness ^^]

Chris: I do not agree. Even if you have more cash, Black has much much more potential. Blacks marked stones are working together very nicely. White has little potential in the centre. Imho Black is ahead.]

(;W[hc]C[Chris: Small: no threat, 5 points of terretory, whites already alive, blacks already alive...]
;B[ng]C[Chris: Black takes a large lead.];W[kp]C[all troubles started here.

Chris: This is again what I didnt like in the first game you sent me. You felt there has something gone wrong in the opening giving Black more potential. This is an attempt to immediately make good shape, which normally is a good idea, but if you compare the efficiency of the Black stones compared to the White you should see that Blacks are more efficient, meaning the error was earlier.]

C[Chris: You may think Blacks and Whites attachment are essentially the same, but this is not true. This attachment has a completely different meaning: It is a leaning attack.Apart from taking away some terretory, it tries to continue building thickness, facing the weak centre group. This is the kind of attachment one should learn to play.]
