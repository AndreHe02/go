(;B[pq]C[is this approach  correct?

Answer: This is not very good, but not too bad.]
(;W[np];B[oq]C[I'm not sure about this and in general with the joseki I try to play here.

Answer: This is a very complex joseki. B11 stretch is a simply variation, especial when you don't sure how to play.]

;B[hj]LB[dj:A][fd:B][fn:C][ld:D]C[I have to take some risk now. I felt myself behind. Was true? How to play instead of this

Answer: It's hard to say which point is best. maybe it is not necessary to invade so deep. "A" is another choice. And at the same time, Black could invade from "B" , "C" and "D". So the White space will not so big.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[gk]C[White is also very dangrous. If Black alive inside, White have not enough space.]
