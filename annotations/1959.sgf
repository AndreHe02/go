C[snip [8k\]: Hello];B[dp]SQ[qc][pd][qd][pe][qe]C[<Bass> Hi, I am Bass, a 1-kyu from Finland, and I will be reviewing your game. My comments will be marked with "<Bass>" at the beginning of the line.
<Bass> Even though this game was played on the net, it is polite to play the first move in the upper right corner :-)]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq];W[pj];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc]
;W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]C[<Bass> So far, looking good for both.]

(;W[dn]C[<Bass> a white move at Q7 or threabouts would also be big, since it ruins black's chinese opening. Most likely it will also be sente. (see var)]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[co];W[dl]C[<Bass> Although not a common joseki, this feels good for black. White got what he wanted, but black's corner is huge after F4.
<Bass> furthermore, there will later be some aji around C10 (see var), so black should feel all right.]

(;B[fd]C[<Bass> You should play at F4 to protect your lower side. now your position is unfinished, and white can destroy the bottom easily.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[nc]C[<Bass> now you have left two weaknesses behind, omitting a move F4 and the leaving the cut at G16. White should be able to exploit one of them later. (see var)]

(;W[ne];B[pc];W[od];B[qc];W[qd];B[rc];W[rd]C[<Bass> white is being nice to you.]
;B[pl]C[<Bass> this is a common follow-up to the chinese opening, and a very good point.]
;W[op];B[pq];W[lo];B[oq];W[np];B[mr];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[pm]
;W[ql];B[po];W[on];B[qk];W[rn];B[qo];W[pk];B[nm]
(;W[nn]C[<Bass> white should have played S9. (see var at previous move)]
;B[rk];W[rm]
(;B[ro]C[<Bass> You should save your cutting stones, especially in this case. (see var)]
;W[nl]C[snip [8k\]: nice move

Shiny [8k\]: clamping tesuji or what is it called? im not sure

snip [8k\]: don't know what it's called.  But it's nice];B[oh]
C[<Bass> This is a difficult move. you cannot attack the white P16 wall yet, and as a reduction move it is too deep. It will be difficult to do anything useful with it, since you really cannot afford to lose sente.]
;W[mh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nh];W[mf];B[mi];W[lg]C[<Bass> that ponnuki truly is worth the proverbial 30 points for white, the G16 cut now really hurts.
<Bass> the black stones, on the other hand, are weak, and cutting two live white groups apart.]
;B[qi];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[qg];W[sg]C[<Bass> T13 is strange, white probably hasn't noticed that black can connect under with S8.]
;B[rg];W[se];B[rl];W[ol];B[sh];W[sf];B[ri];W[om]C[<Bass> This white move (P7) is totally useless.]
;B[id]C[<Bass> and you fixed your biggest problem. Very good.]
;W[ld];B[gg];W[lc];B[mb];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi];B[en]C[<Bass> and you also got to play around here first. very nice.]
;W[em];B[fn];W[jo];B[ip];W[io];B[hp];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er]
;W[cp];B[do]
(;W[bp]
(;B[bn]C[<Bass> looks like you could have killed the white group (see var)]
;W[br];B[ds];W[cs];B[cr];W[qj];B[rj];W[dr];B[es];W[cr];B[aq]
C[<Bass> this is useless.];W[ap];B[ar];W[as];B[bs]
(;W[bm]C[<Bass> White should have lived right away with B3]
;B[an]C[<Bass> This must be at A5, to turn the corner into a real ko.]
;W[as]C[<Bass> No.];B[ae]C[<Bass> There is no ko. and, while this move takes points and is a ko threat, it also destroys any potential left in the C14 stone.]
;W[bf];B[bs];W[si];B[sj];W[as];B[am];W[bq];B[bk]C[<Bass> Well, you got your threat even though there was no ko :-)]
;W[bl];B[al];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj];B[ak];W[dj]C[<Bass> white is behind in secure territory now, so maybe you could just try to reduce the center now.]

(;B[dm];W[cl];B[el];W[dk];B[ek];W[ej];B[fm]C[<Bass> gote.];W[ji]

[ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[<Bass> In the end, quite a nice game. The center changed owners twice, but you got it in the end, and that decided the match.
<Bass> To improve your play, I recommend studying life-and-death problems, it will probably improve your overall strength the most. 
<Bass> Another bit of advice: learn to stay calm even when the battle is on. Some of your moves looked like you had played them hurriedly, without a second thought, when the fighting was hottest. Learn to question your intuition.
<Bass> Also, find some professional games and place the stones on a real goban. This will improve your opening, since you'll soon learn to finish josekis and not to leave cutting points behind.
<Bass> That's all, hope you find this review helpful.

Shiny [8k\]: yes, but i think your invasion shouldnt have lived

snip [8k\]: no, you had the game won

Shiny [8k\]: they were too deep, but i made mistakes
