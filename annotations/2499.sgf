C[Hi, my name is Eric, I played white and lost.
I
made many big mistakes, but what I am interested to know is how I could
have played differently to keep the initiative more. I felt like I was
pushed around in this game.

Thank you for your time     =)

Firstly,
generally you didn't play a bad game. Twice black ripped you off, move
61 and move 219. These two mistakes alone represent most of the
difference between you two players. Then the corner invasion, at C17,
is very big and remains while many small moves are played. When black
invades, white can kill. To improve, the thing you should do is study
Tesuji and Life & Death. There are plenty of good books to help
this. I recommend problems books like Graded Go Problems but there are
plenty of others.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp];B[cj];W[cg];B[cn]
;W[cl]C[Was this too bold?

No, it is fine. It sets up a fighting game.];B[dl]
(;W[bl]C[This
is a little unusual. It would be more common to cut. It takes territory
but black does have a wall. See variation for an example.];B[do]
;W[bn];B[eq]C[It seems to give black a nice wall from here]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[co];B[dn];W[dr];B[er];W[dq];B[dk];W[kq]C[was this the right moment/spot to invade?
It is OK and neutralises blacks wall. However, black attacked you from the wrong side. See variation.]

(;B[iq];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qj];W[jo]C[was this in the right direction?
This
is an OK move particularly as black answers :)];B[ho]C[This point in
the game, is very difficult and where to move is really a matter of
taste. I prefer a little more ambition although it can cause
complicated situations. See variations for some ideas.]
(;W[jd];B[oc]
(;W[qh]C[here, i think around R6 or 7 might have been better...?
There
is no difference in the space between the black stones at the at R12 or
R6. One difference is that you have a group close by. However, there
are risks there too. A splitting attack could be very dangerous. I have
tried to illustrate some of this in the variation.];B[ph];W[qe]
;B[qg];W[pg];B[pf];W[qf];B[og];W[rg];B[pg];W[qc]C[Going into the corner is good.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rh]
(;W[sf]C[Good move?
Solid connection is probably better.];B[pc];W[qb];B[pe];W[rc]
C[Again you should probably connect below at S15. It avoids the rip off later.]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[on];W[sh];B[ri];W[na];B[si];W[sg]C[This is the mistake. You should not connect.]
;B[se];W[re];B[rf]C[obviously, i had not foreseen this... was this because of my stone at T14?]
;W[sd];B[sf];W[pb];B[ob];W[oa];B[mb];W[ld]C[Big or small? Any suggestions?
You
get away with this because black answers. I think that a move at D17,
to take corner territory, or L14 to enlarge your moyo could be better.]

;B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[in];B[hn];W[il];B[hm];W[jl];B[hl]C[These are all good moves and I think you are pushing black around!]
;W[jk];B[ij];W[ml];B[nk];W[gg]C[At
this point it is difficult for you to make many points in the centre.
Blacks move at J10 makes this difficult. I think you should take the
corner. Again because black answers, it becomes a good move for you.]

I'm
not sure this is possible. I think this exchange where you steal some
of the corner and give up these four stones is good for you]
