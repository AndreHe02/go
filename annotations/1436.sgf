C[I
played black this game.  For most of the game it was somewhat close (although
I was behind), but he managed to do much better than I in the endgame and
won by 15.5 points.

The biggest problem that I see with my play in
this game is that I made a lot of slow moves.  I'd appreciate any insight
into how I can improve.  Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[pj]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[kq];B[cn]C[Would
it have been better to approach his 3-3 stone instead?  I haven't played
against many opponents who use a 3-3 opening, so I'm never sure how to respond
when I see one.

pem: No, I think this is ok. There's no rush to approach the 3-3 stone.]
;W[dn]
(;B[cp]TR[kq][nq]C[I'm
not very familiar with joseki in this position.  The one that I'm somewhat
familiar with is the attach-and-extend, but I felt like if I played that
out it would work too well with his marked stones.

pem: Black can't
play like this, he must play D7 anyway. Now White will wedge between Black's
stones with C5. If he dislikes the attach&exten variant, he should perhaps
enter at F3 instead. (Although I think C6 is better anyway.)]

(;W[cq]C[pem: A mistake. White must play between Black's stones.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[ep];B[dm];W[fc];B[en]C[Was this too slow?  Would now be a good time to approach his top left corner?

pem: No, I think it's very good. White should have connected.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc]C[pem: This should be O18.]
;B[me]C[Mistake on my part, should've continued pushing at O16

pem: No, this is ok. It's joseki when White playss O18 (instead of P17), and I can't see that this is different.]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[md];B[ld];W[mf];B[mc]C[Trying to stay connected.]
;W[pf]TR[ph][qh]C[pem:
White has played too close to Black's wall here. Black should try to take
advantage of this. It's difficult to give any exact sequence in a fight like
this, but a starting point might be to play Q12 or R12 to keep White without
a base. The white stones should become a burden, and Black should get profit
from chasing them (not necessarily killing them!) on the right side or in
the center for instance.];B[nf]LB[of:1][og:2][ng:3]C[This cut didn't work out like I thought it would, was probably a mistake

pem:
Yes. See previous comment. If Black want to cut through the white stones,
the sequence is P14, P13, O13, but this requires a favourable ladder which
isn't the case here.];W[ng];B[of];W[og];B[oe];W[ph];B[qi];W[qq]

(;B[qp]C[pem. A good choice (compared to the other josekis).]

(;W[rq]C[pem: This should be S2.];B[or];W[rs];B[rp];W[sr];B[qr]
C[pem:
Black must simply connect at P3. Compare this with the josekis where White
either connects out or gets a larger corner. This would be good for Black.]

pem: No, that's inside Black's own territory.];W[pi];B[qj]TR[qh]

pem: Yes, I can't see anything terrible happen from a White atari at R10.]

This is good.];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq]C[pem: Even better, since
White continues to crawl from behind instead of jumping.];B[lp]

not necessary.  Trying to seal him in and stay connected with my 4 stones
on the bottom.  Gave him a nice point though

pem: Probably wise. But locally, G6 or G7 is better.];W[cg]
;B[ci];W[cj]C[pem: This looks like an overplay...]
(;B[dj]C[pem:
This is probaly also ok, but might make it easier for White to wriggle his
way out. (And it's leaning too close to Black's strength.)]

pem: Better at H17.];W[cf];B[ee];W[dd];B[dg];W[be];B[ed]C[Too slow and gote... should've probably extended along the top]

Not sure what this does. In the center, H12 might be interesting. (But B3
is still there...)];W[ii];B[ki];W[lk];B[hj];W[hi]C[pem: Black hardly wants White to connect here, so why force him?]
