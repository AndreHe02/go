C[Hello,  I am your reviewer, odif(on kgs)
My first thoughts on your game is that you wasted a lot of time on the right side playing non-urgent moves. Some of your problems stem from technique, this is not so important as this will improve with experience. The main thing is not that you were not aggressive enough, but that you did not look at the whole board from the beginning. In the opening try to sketch out roughly some influence or potential territory. It is not important that you actually get land at the beginning of the game, but only at the end.If some stones die,it doesn't matter, as long as you are continuing to develop everywhere.]
;B[pd]C[This game was a horrible loss. (w +61.5) Well actually, I've lost by more ;).

Still I would like to know how white won by so much so that I won't lose like this again. (at least not lose like this as much)

My theory was that I wasn't aggressive enough and didn't invade until the end. But being a 30k, I don't really know.

Anyway thanks in advance for reviewing.];W[cd];B[qq];W[co];B[pj]

in answer to your question of not being aggressive enough, I think that you were very aggressive, but just on the right side.I think some of your moves were very aggressive, which helped your opponent make strong his stones and give him a huge influence on the left. you never even contested the bottom left area, and then when you did invade on the left, it was too late.]
