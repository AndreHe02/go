C[This game was decided early on with the enourmous moyo and outer influence on my side (black) but I feel like I could have used my influence better... in the end I ended up loosing a lot of stones that I was sure would live. Thanks for your time!

Mils: Sorry that this review was so long in coming, but thanks for waiting. I'll be prefixing my comments with an "M". I'll also be commenting the move in the original game before the variation I provide - just letting you know so that there's no confusion.

I think I addressed just about everything, but if you're in doubt about something, I hang around KGS as Kifudancer. If you want, let me know if you're confused, or just want a game, teaching or otherwise.]

;B[qo];W[qq];B[po];W[or]TR[cf]C[M: Be aware that as soon as this move is played, the ladder for the triangled cut still works, even if it doesn't appear to. I'll give you the variation when white actually cuts in the game.]
;B[qj];W[jq];B[co]C[I was thinking of turning this into an attack on C10, but in review of the entire game, would a reduction move be better than a full invation?

M: *doubtfully* An invasion here looks fine to me.];W[bp]C[M: I've seen this move a lot, but personally, I don't like it. It seems to me that it strengthens the attacking stone. As per the following moves...]

;B[fo];W[cf]C[I should have expected that and cleaned up with C13 earlier if I wanted to attack C10

M: As you can see with the variation, it was alright. If white's confident enough to play the ladder, you've basically won.]

M: Again, see the ladder. No need for aji here.];W[cg];B[dd]

;B[df]
(;W[af]TR[bo][co][fo][cp]C[Now I have confined him to the side with a huge moyo on top. Should I have played P15 now to start making territory now and then help the marked stones live?

M: See my comments on P15 when it was actually played. At this point, I'd be feeling more inclined to play a move at C8 to give life to the triangled stones.

Everything could go pear-shaped if you're forced to run with this group, as white will run along side you, harrassing you, and building more than enough strength to nullify your moyo. (Following the proverb and assuming perfect play, that is)]

(;B[jo]C[M: Unfortunately, this move I don't like. Playing on top of a group like this is rarely a good idea. It generally just creates another weak stone to have to take care of - the one you played on top to begin with.]

M: You were right. The wall IS too big to kill. However, that won't stop many people from trying, as you saw. Although, you'll want to watch your weakness at C6 (triangled).]
;B[oo];W[kn];B[jn];W[km]
(;B[kl]C[Should I have gone for K7 here?

M: Most definately. Try not to play on top like this unless you've read a definate benefit. Again, it generally doesn't do anything but create another weak stone to try and have to pull out. :) As I'm sure you found out.

Plus, this is the mistake that cost you your wall.];W[jm];B[im]
