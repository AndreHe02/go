C[Hi, this was a close game and I would like it reviewed. I played white. My rank says 27k on kisiedo go server, but i don't know if that is at all accurate.
I know both of us made several obvious mistakes in the game.
I would particularly like comments on how I could have minimized the invasion on the left side.
Also, any help with the opening and endgame would be appreciated, as well as any other important things you see.

Thanks,
--Pete


Fabian: Hi, I hope my review is useful and that you will enjoy playing go as much as I do when you get stronger.]

;W[po];B[jc];W[dj]LB[oq:a][pq:b][qj:c][pj:d][jq:e][jp:f]C[I wasn't sure if it is better to play something like p3 here, or after the taking the start point. In general, I would like feedback on my opening move choices.


Fabian: After going through this game and also a few ones on kgs that you played, I must say that you shouldn't be worried about the opening to much, other things are probably more important. I will address this in my summary. Anyway it is not bad to examine a few ideas, when playing the opening, even at your level. Don't be scared to try out new things, though!

Q5 is very influence-oriented and it is not a move to keep things simple and straight (like 4-4 and 3-3 corner plays are in a way). It can easily be invaded at a or b for example, but white can usually build up a nice wall on the outside. Especially in the beginning such a powerful wall can be more important than a little territory in the corner, at the same time approaching a stone at 4-5 from the outside is not such an attractive option, since it gives a lot of territory to the other player. Therefore playing around a stone at 4-5 must be very well timed.

Something to aim at in the opening is a so called "double wing formation", a corner stone and extension on both sides. Black could play at c or d to form such a formation. At the same time White could play at e or f, this would also work together very well with the Q5 stone. so blacks next move is not in a bad area.

To answer your question about p3 move, I think forming a corner enclosure (shimari) at b would be the best play in that area and is definitely possible. However the idea of playing at 5-4 is often not to form a shimari, but invite an invasion and play in a way that you can gain from attacking that invasion. I f you want to focus on making a territory with a corner enclosure 3-4 right away is the usual idea. However we also often see 5-4 plays end up as an shimari with an additional play at b.]
;B[kp];W[oq]LB[pq:a][qq:b]C[Fabian: This is slightly unusal, playing at a to form a shimari (corner enclosure) is the usual idea. This way an invasion at b is probably possible more easily (at least with supporting stones on the outside later on)]
;B[pj]C[Fabian: Black grabs the key point];W[ip]C[Fabian: good! both attack the black stone and create your own double wing!]
;B[kn];W[in]C[Fabian: good, create strentgh in front of your corner formation, this could soon turn into a "moyo" (are of influence which could become territory).]
;B[nn];W[on]LB[pm:a]C[Fabian: This contact play is the worng idea. Since contact plays tend to strenghten both sides in the same way. Therefore to attack this Black group (what you should be doing), don't touch it! I would rather play something like a.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[oo];W[pn];B[no];W[op];B[ol];W[pl];B[pk]C[Fabian: In this exchange you got some nice territory around the corner and black was able to settle his group easily, playing a little too careful though. 4th and 5th line territory is a big success for white.]
;W[cf]C[Fabian: Very good. Both an extension from your double wing formation and an approach move towards blacks corner.]
;B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[ef]C[Fabian: up to here it is good for you, since you are now forming a wall towards your moyo at the bottom. It is still possible for black to invade this area, but will definitely get some profit there.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[gg]LB[ge:a]C[Fabian: instead of this I would try to do something to split black or reduce his area somewhat. a looks promising.]
;B[ge];W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[kk];W[kj]LB[qc:a][pc:b][cq:c][dq:d]
[cp:e][hg:f]MA[gg]C[Fabian: I think continuing on the upper side is better since black is not going to make so much territory in the middle, whereas on the top it is starting to get *a lot*.
Also you should consider that although the lower right and upper left corner are going to be territory, the upper right area is still open for invasion at least at a and b and the lower right at c, d and e.
You must therefore evaluate if it is going to be better to play at e for example and to accept reduction from the outside, than a later invasion from the inside. At the same time invading yourself at a or b is very big.
After you started with the marked stone, I would now play at f, but then switch either to e and forestall an invasion or b to invade myself.]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[ed];B[ee];W[eh];B[ec]C[transform [27k?\]: is this game untimed?

Fabian: This move is definitely very small. Capturing a single stone which does not cut apart to groups and that would probably be dead anyway is a bad move.]

(;W[mq]C[Fabian: invasions or forestalling one definitely better right now.]
;B[lr];W[kq];B[lq];W[jq];B[np];W[nq];B[mp]
(;W[mr]C[Fabian: small, although black can jump to p1 (monkey jump tesuji), invading is *much bigger*.]

;B[ik];W[il];B[jj]MA[jj][ij][ii]LB[ih:a]C[Fabian: this black looks very odd. It forms an "empty triangle* (where two stones share a liberty, thus reducing the liberties of the group by one, marked, which is therefore a bad shape to avoid) and leves open the cut at a.]

(;W[ki];B[ih]C[Fabian: now, black has guarded his cut and your stones face a doubtful future.]

(;B[co]C[I wasn't sure how to deal with this invasion, and was unhappy with the amount of territory black won in this battle. How could I have minimized this?


Fabian: I will include variations on this invasion and how to deal with it, but the main point is: an invasion is still possible and it is your fault, that you didn't prevent it earlier,  since black gave you the chance.
the way black plays here is dangerous, but you answered incorrectly see the variations i included.]

;B[cn];W[ic]C[Fabian: the following moves are all quite unnecessary and obvious failures. Although they do not hurt your score, it is a bad habit to "just try". instead try to find weak points and read out if you can exploit them, if you can't find any way to invade where you couldn't easily stop yourself do not try it. if you are unsure though, it is ok. that way you won't annoy your opponent and you will at the same time practise your reading skills.]

;W[js];B[ls];W[ms];B[ae];W[af]LB[fh:a]C[Fabian: this is very small (1 point in ko) if you guard at a it is worth 8 points if compared with the later result, you could have gained 7,5 points. You probably missed the danger there though. So my main comment about endgame is: try to count how many points you can loose if you don't defend and how many you can take away from your opponent elsewhere. this is often difficult. especially since continuations are sometimes hard to see. keep in mind that you do not have to answer your opponents moves if they don't threaten to do evil things and you will not be off too bad.]

Fabian:   Summary:

-ugly mistakes are still the dominant element of your game, so just keep playing and you will get better, since you will stop making them! Learn the fundamentals (as Kageyama says in "lessons in the fundamentals of go" if you see a stone that looks like it can be captured, hold up two fingers and think can I capture it in a ladder, can I capture it in a net?).  Consider if a cut does not have to be guarded because the cutting stone could immediately be captured and grab the initiative instead.

- both territories were very big, and invaded at a very late point. if you do not see any way to reduce your opponents area from the outside but an invasion seems possible, do it immediately, since it is usually huge.

- opening and endgame are very important areas in the game of go. However very difficult areas.
.it is impossible to play accurate endgame moves, when you still aren't sure of how stones are connected, can be captured unconditionally, and so on. You made very many moves inside your opponents territory in the end, which were all captured. I would have made not a single one of them because for the stronger player they are obvious failures. If you cannot read this out you must first acquire this skill, since otherwise you will never be able to tell if it is safe to leave things as they are or necessary to add a defensive move. So additionally to play a lot without worrying too much, try to read out as much as possible in a very short time and don't make a habit of defending automatically. if you don't see a threat, try to find a big point for yourself.

- opening is even more difficult. but many things are possible there and maybe quickly going through some pro games can give you some idea of  what fomrations can emerge naturally. otherwise do not worry too much, keep things simple. try not to form weak groups to early.


I hope I gave you some ideas to experiment with, however the most important thing is to play a lot. If you just play games for another month, you will probably see a lot of mistakes in your games that you play right now yourself. If you feel stuck, do some problems on tesuji, which will certainly increase your reading abilities by a lot.]
