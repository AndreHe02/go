C[<W> Thank you for reviewing this game. I will comment on my thoughts behind most of the moves; feel free to correct my thinking when wrong, but I'd prefer if you not focus on it overmuch, but just use it as an aide for reviewing.

<W> In this game where I take white I felt I made a rather good start, then played overly agressive when I should have played safe to win, and then only won because of a big black mistake. Things I would like help with are my timing (when to tenuki or not) and any technical mistakes that I have not already commented on and understood trough my personal review.

Nathan: If you are winning a game, definitely play solidly and try to wrap it up.  Make sure to fix any weakness to prevent against any comebacks or upsets.  B failed many times to exploit weaknesses in your shape/positions.

It was a pleasure to review your game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ed]
C[<W> I am experimenting here; I have never played 5-4 much, and am trying it out to learn.]
;B[pk];W[nc];B[lc]
(;W[ne]C[<W> I am unsure at this point whether moving out is a good idea, but don't feel that jumping into the corner is better. Any other options I should have in mind?

N: Jumping into the corner is fine - you can use sente to reduce B's moyo.]
;B[pf];W[ng]LB[pb:A][jc:B]C[<W> Too far out?

N: You may want to consider playing A or B.  This move is not entirely bad or game-losing.]
;B[ph];W[pb]C[<W> I am trying to get some base for my group. Some have told me saving the potential in the corner for a later 3-3 invasion is better, but it doesn't really suit me to leave such a large point for black to take.

N: This looks OK.];B[hc]LB[jc:A]C[N: This looks thin and as White, I'd prefer to play at A.]

(;W[jq]C[<W> Want to stop black from getting any double-wing formation.]
;B[dc]C[<W> Here I am unsure how to reply, and upon reviewing the game, this move isn't even in the joseki dictionary. Did I handle the situation ok?

N: E17 looks like the proper move, even though you are giving B a big corner.  Letting Black connect underneath at E17 seems to let him off the hook too easily.]

(;W[dd];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[gd]C[<W> I was kind of expecting a black move on the left side, allowing me to build up more potential in the center, but I am satisfied with this result aswell.

N: B seems to have gotten off easy here.];W[dh]LB[di:A]C[N: too close to your wall, A is better]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[<W> I thank black for his generous move];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]C[<W> Want to leave as little potential as possible for the C6 stone]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[gp]LB[go:A]C[N: Wrong move, should be A.  This leaves weakness in your shape.]
;B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[jj]C[<W> Realizing I leave a weakness behind, I still feel that completing the moyo is more urgent at this point.

N: These weaknesses reduce the potential of your moyo.];B[fp]
;W[fo]
(;B[jl]C[See variation for B];W[hl]C[<W> I invite the sequence that follows, becomming solid in exchange for a slight reduction.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[ij];W[gi];B[gf];W[he]C[<W> I did not see any weakness at all in blacks tobi, so kikashi at once

N: I don't like this exchange.  Just play R17.  J4 is also big as is approaching the lower right corner.]
;B[ge];W[qc]C[<W> Felt this was getting warm, as my group is in the middle of alot of black influence. Considered briefly playing k15, but didn't want to attach too much importance to h15, and black would just solidify his top.

N: YOu could also consider playing M16 to protect the weakness at P17]

(;B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[nj];B[nh]
(;W[og]C[<W> In retrospect I think N12 is better, which was the reason I played O10 instead of O11 in the first place.

N: See variation];B[oh];W[pg];B[qg]
(;W[mp]C[<W> Reducing/attacking from the other side instead, and in doing so help reduce the aji of the j4 weakness aswell.

N: There is a weakness at the top.]
(;B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[go];B[im];W[po]
(;B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[or]C[<W> This all seem generous of black, does he not have more severe moves?

N: See variations at move 69.  B could've played more severe.

<W> Looking at this position in review, I see that I should win easilly; I have three stable groups to blacks four with one weak, and more territory than him.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[on];W[no]C[<W> In retrospect does not look like the right shape at all. P4 better?

N: Looks fine];B[rn];W[qm];B[rq];W[rm];B[ro];W[ol]C[<W> Had read this out, knew black could not cut without getting in trouble here. Thought I could capture P6

N: B can cut...]
(;B[nn];W[pl]C[<W> But here I have to meekly defend while black escapes.]
;B[mo];W[qk]C[<W> Looked too big to resist, and I needed time to think about the O4 situation without tipping off my opponent.]
;B[pj];W[ri]
(;B[qi];W[rh];B[qh];W[mn]C[<W> Best I could come up with. Realized I couldn't capture, but was hoping to play P5 in sente.]
;B[lo];W[np];B[mm];W[lp]C[<W> I'm sure I can live now.];B[ko]
;W[lj]
(;B[ji]C[See variation];W[ki];B[jh];W[kh];B[mg];W[nf];B[kg]
;W[jg]
(;B[kf];W[ig];B[hh];W[ii]C[<W> Since my cut didn't work, I made another.]
;B[ih];W[hi]C[<W> I was sure this was sente, H13 looks awfully big.]
;B[jk];W[kj]
(;B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[oj];B[qj];W[rj];B[rg];W[sk]C[<W> Alive here aswell]
;B[hm]C[N: B should play H13];W[fl];B[fm]
(;W[hg]C[<W> I did not see any big followups to F7, so I took the big point of H13. How I missed the big black moves that could bring c6 back to life is beyond me. Chalk it up to kyu disease.]
;B[el];W[jd]C[<W> Realize here that my big moyo is reduced to nothing (but still not seeing the C6 stone as alive) I try to make the most out of my resurrected way into blacks top center.]
;B[jc];W[ld]C[<W> Aiming to cut at N12];B[md];W[le];B[mc];W[nd]
C[<W> Didn't dare othervise.];B[mi]LB[bb:B][nb:A][lh:C]C[<W> Of course black connects]

(;W[mk]C[<W> Resisted the impulse to play N10; Q8 is alive and L12 can capture H12 in time

N: There are bigger points such as A or B.  Locally, the move is C]
;B[mj];W[ml];B[nm];W[gh]C[<W> But I don't feel too confident about it, so I safe it out. At this point I felt I had a grip on the victory anyway.]
;B[lk];W[ll]C[<W> Just to preserve as much of the aji of these stones as possible, I give them another liberty]
;B[kk];W[ir]C[<W> Felt like endgame time.

N: B18 is much bigger, as is defending the weakness at P18.]

(;B[hr];W[bb];B[en];W[dm]C[<W> I still do not see how dangerous the C6 stone is.]
;B[dn];W[bn]C[<W> Now I do...];B[em];W[eo]C[<W> Too greedy?]
;B[ck];W[gm];B[gn];W[gl];B[fn];W[bl]C[<W> Unsure here if black can kill, but has to struggle the best way I see how.

See variation]
(;B[dk];W[bj];B[bk];W[ak];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[cj];B[dj];W[bh]
;B[cg];W[bg]C[<W> I am confident here that black will connect at D11; if I cut I feel certain I have the liberties to kill.]

(;B[cf];W[di]C[<W> Black wanted a fight it seemed.]
(;B[dg]C[See variation];W[dl];B[ei]
(;W[be]C[<W> I did not see that ladder... I realize there's alot of aji around the H6 and E9 cutting points, but don't dare do anything until I am alive on the edge.]
;B[bf];W[af];B[ce];W[cd];B[fj];W[hj]C[<W> I thank black for fixing up one of my weaknesses]

;B[er];W[hs];B[fr];W[jp];B[jo];W[mr];B[gs];W[db];B[eb];W[ca]
;B[je];W[lf]C[<W> Absentminded, silly move that does nothing and threatens nothing.]
;B[hf];W[lg]C[<W> He ignored my non-existent threat, so I followed trough.]
;B[lh];W[cm]C[<W> This seemed such a huge move in and off itself that I didn't realize it was sente.]
;B[hn]C[<W> Black defends on the wrong side; that connection is already good.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[fk]C[<W> All I really had in mind was the half point at G9]
;B[eh];W[fg]C[<W> Blacks big mistake. Without this he had a 10-point lead on me atleast.

N: I show what B should've played.
