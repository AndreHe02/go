Reviewer: Hi, I hope this review will be helpful to improve your go :)
All my comments are marked with "R:" before them.
For any question you can find me on KGS as Wiles.];B[cp];W[pq]
;B[dc];W[pc];B[qn];W[qj];B[qq];W[qp];B[pp];W[po];B[op];W[qo]
;B[pr];W[oo];B[np]C[R: i think it is better for black to simply take one stone, so white cannot play the big move of S3 too, i think the result in the game is sightly better for white]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[no];B[mp]
(;W[cj];B[qe]
(;W[qg];B[qc]
(;W[pd]C[R: building a wall is not the best choice since you don't have an extension on the side (if C10 was played at K16 instead, this would be the way to play)]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[qf];W[pf];B[rg];W[qh];B[pb];W[jd]C[White 32: better at P18 ?

R: Now you see why your strategy with Q16 was not so good. White cannot get both P18 and an extension on the side, so he's not satisfied]
;B[nb];W[me];B[cf];W[cm];B[hc];W[hq]C[White 38: better at E3 ?

R: I think so, letting black make a shimari at E3 simplifies the game too much.
Black has three corners and is very solid, you have the big moyo on the right, but it is not clear how many points you can make. 
If you are sure you can make enough points then is a good choice, but is hard to judge...]
;B[eq]
(;W[kq];B[ko]C[R: i don't like this exchange, since L5 weaken your moyo.
M6 seems a very good move to play instead];W[ho];B[eo];W[bo]
C[White 44: better at B6 or B12 or H15 ?

R: this is just a yose move... 
H15 seems best, but after L5 is in place it is not easy to expand your moyo]
;B[bp];W[nk]C[White 46: better at H15 ?

R: Yes, this is slow];B[km];W[kj];B[lg]C[Black 49: better at H14 or H15 or J15 ?

R: all the move you suggested would be better, black is going too deep, this is a good chance for you]
;W[he]C[White 50: better at H16 ?

R: this is ok];B[jf];W[hd]C[White 52: better at H13 or F15 ?

R: H13 would be very interesting, surely it cannot be bad];B[ic]
;W[je];B[gc];W[ef];B[hg];W[ed];B[ec];W[ce]C[R: very good, now you have the initiative, black has only got trouble for himself with M13...]
;B[ch]C[Black 61: better at C16 ?

R: I think a move to defend the center group is needed here]
;W[cd];B[eg]
(;W[df]C[R: this is bad, you should try to cut black, this move only help him fixing his shape]
;B[dg];W[bf];B[cg];W[nh]C[White 68: better at F13 ?

R: yes, but it was more effective without the D14-D13 exchange]
;B[bc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bd];B[bb];W[if]C[White 74: better at F13 ?]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[kf]C[Black 77: better at K12 ?

R: sure, this is a gift from black...];W[jh];B[ff]C[R: Another reason why the D14-D13 exchange is bad, now you also have liberty shortage]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[fe];B[de];W[dd];B[ee];W[fd]C[R: of course having black make life for this group "sente" is a big loss for white...
Even so L14 was a big gift and in the end it was enough to secure the victory, but next time you may not be so lucky, so better not to waste the opportunity to attack such a group]
;B[hf]C[Black 87: aji-keshi ?

R: a bit, but it's not a big problem];W[ie];B[jc];W[ld];B[lc]
;W[mc];B[lb];W[bi]C[White 94: better at B10 ?

R: this is ok];B[ah];W[bn];B[bj];W[bk];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[dk]

;B[ls];W[iq];B[io];W[mq]C[White 122: better at S2 or S12 ?

R: yes, but since this is sente you can still play there later]
;B[nr];W[nc];B[mb];W[rh]C[White 126: better at S2 ?
