game I as gonovice (26l - 22k?) played against geronimus (16k?)
gonovice - black - me
geronimus - white

I think I played a bad fuseki and gained too little territory

I think my invasions worked well but lost a couple of crucial fights

I allowed white to gain sente at the end to reduce my territory

I would welcome any comments or suggestions

Many Thanks,

Hi!

I'm Jean.
I'll try to put some comments];B[qo];W[dd];B[qc];W[dq];B[pq]
C[fairly standard opening
top right corner secure with one stone little area
bottom right secure with two stones larger are];W[ck];B[pf]
LB[jp:A][jq:B][iq:C][do:D][co:E][gq:F]C[think I did wrong here ?
gains more territory but unsecure

Yes, Too vague
3-3 at the begining is difficult to
extent.

I like A,B or C to extent low-right
or D, E to attack the corner

Or F and then  D,E  if W answer at B
or A otherwise];W[jd];B[jq]C[am getting concerned that I have less territory even though territory more secur

White not secure either at this time];W[gq];B[ch]C[start an invasion on either top left or left sid]
;W[cf];B[cc]C[white has predominance in top left ... try to win space in corner
(too early perhaps?

TOO early, specially with C12
risking a separation from the
corner after the white response

little Black territory and big White
influence];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[ad]LB[db:A]C[First, play at the other side A
or white will kill the group];W[cb]C[Black collapse];B[bb]
(;W[eb]C[White should play A (B17) first
to suppress an eye and then
kill with B (B19)

See variation];B[bc]C[have secured corner but lost  sente

4 corner points (because
white played bad)

big moyo white];W[nc]C[moyo extention
cool];B[ob]C[would p17 have been a better defence?

Yes I prefer P17 at contact
and good with Q14 (good shape];W[nb]C[P18 force white to
a good answer
(thank you move)
reinforcing its territory];B[oc]C[have allowed white to cordon off top sid

and black has to add a stone
and lose sente];W[qj];B[ij]LB[qm:A][qh:B]C[aiming for a link top right to middle left

very bad move for a beginner
at least (I am of this kind!)

No answer to the White attack
R10. W will stabilise quickly
at the right with A or B

On the other side, it will be difficult to connect C12
white pressure at D11, E12

the only meaning would be
an extention of the bottom
right moyo. but too long and
the white R10 remaining as a threat];W[gj]C[not good
too far away of C9];B[de]LB[ef:A]C[hoping for white to play the ladder e15 ... I can join to i1

don't play hoping your
oponnent will play bad!

White A (E14)  should take the Black stone
See variation]
(;W[df]C[bad : see prev];B[ee];W[gd]C[should better continue to cut
the black stones from the centre
at F14 for ex];B[ql]C[badly need territory no

good!
not only for territory but to attack
white also (both attack AND defense together is always
better)];W[qg]C[maybe to far];B[qf];W[pg];B[nf]C[start the move top right to cente

good cut + extent];W[od]LB[nd:A]C[I think Black could answer A
because he's strong in the corner

try variations]
(;B[pd]C[very defensive];W[ne];B[oe];W[nd];B[ok]C[start the move bottom right to center

atack and defense : good];W[og];B[of];W[rf];B[re];W[rh];B[lj]

too far away from white :
better P11 for example];W[jo]C[maybe better at N3];B[ko];W[lq]
;B[kp]C[I should be able to contain m3

sure];W[kq];B[jr];W[jp];B[jn]C[threaten i4 to ladder to c12]
;W[ip]C[bad shape

H4 better];B[iq]C[threaten h4

white is separated in 2 groups  but black also : beware...]

(;B[pp]C[i think this is the move that lost me the bottom right corner

q2 instead threatening p4 follow up with r4
?

loosing the corner is not always
bad if you become stronger
outside

You cannot win everything,
both side,..

the variation try Q2 and W has the corner threraning to save the  M3 group and live]
;W[pr];B[op]C[this is good for you :
white loose the sente to take  10 points in the corner];W[in]
C[I think you can kill white in the corner at S3];B[jm];W[im]
;B[il];W[hl]C[have allowed white to build a wall to cordon off bottom left.

Not sure how I should have played to prevent this

The demarcation line is
better four you

You can still attack bottom left];B[ik]C[too slow at this time]

think to your stone left at
the up : aji];W[lf];B[mg];W[ae]C[strange!];B[af];W[ag];B[ae]
C[can still form two eyes threaten b13 to win sente

you have 2 eyes for long

white should have play
A14, threaning A15 which
get the eye];W[bg];B[eh]C[trying to enclose a13 group

no problem for W if good answer

you have to connect these
2 black stone or better live at
the left side];W[ef];B[gi]C[a13 group has broken free (for now)
trying for link i10 to left middle

yeah!

think to attack C9, aiming  left bottom];W[hi];B[hj]C[no: will reinforce white]

become difficult to attack C9];B[hg]C[your left left stones are weak too!
should end with a big white

biggest escape for white is b12 or f15

blacks stones are still very weak

white played not very good but
no real risk for B13 group];W[eg];B[fe]C[good for black if F11 lived]
;W[ei];B[ej]C[had I played f12 white could surround me?

but this move allowed white the opportunity to split my attack

See prev comments
Black should have attack
at the left side

black saved the D15 stones
but made not enought territory

to get life];W[dj]C[good

white could still respond with f8 though];W[el]C[good];B[hk]
C[threatening g8 ... all this does is force white to make more secure with g8 or f8

white will answer at G8
and G8 is GOOD for white

that's a thnk you move];W[gl]C[black stones are taken];B[ca]
C[very few points to get here];W[db];B[fc]C[start attack on d18 group

GOOD]
