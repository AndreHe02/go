C[[jfc\]

I'm playing White (drunkard).

My biggest concerns in this game are the opening and early middle game.

Later in the game, I was occassionally forced to move before I was ready but with 1 minute byo-yomi I had a reasonable amount of time even when I felt rushed.

I realize that I'm losing at the end, even if my big dragon lives.

my questions below will be prefixed with [jfc\]. 

Thanks in advance for the review.  

[prana\]
Thanks for giving me this interesting game to analyse.

The fuseki of this game is on a high level.
Black built up a framework, white answered blacks moves in a solid way.

I don't see a siginificant advantage for black in the beginning. But if you feel uneasy about this kind of fuseki, there are plenty of alternative moves, which disturb blacks plans right at the beginning. This appears to be more a question of personal preference...

The decisive part of the game is the fighting in the early middle game: Because White failed to defend the bottom group properly, Black could start a powerful attack on it. Black skillfully harassed the escaping group. Eventually, the unlucky group died. (This, of course was unnecessary).

I will show some variations on how this weak group could have been settled (sabaki).
There are plenty of standard techniques for invading and making sabaki, which are essential in a lot of situations.

Studying this techniques (e.g. with books or by replaying professional games) might enrich your Go skills significally.

Enjoy,

(;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[ob];B[qi];W[nd]SQ[qi][kq]C[[jfc\] I don't like this result.

The two marked black stones make an invasion at P4 difficult.

[prana\] 
I think the result is ok.

I don't think that invading at P4 is difficult.
There is still plenty of space there.]
(;B[cf]C[[prana\] Black could play P4 immediately.]
(;W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[op]LB[oi:B][pm:A][oq:C]C[[jfc\] before this move, I think B is ahead by a little.

I don't like what results from white P4 but in retrospect I'm not sure what would be better.

[prana\] w gets 7 points komi. I think the situation is quite even.

P4 is good. It prevents the shimari.

Alternative moves one might consider are A, B, C.
But I think P4 is the best one.

In the following I added some variations to demonstrate how to settle the group in a light and flexible way (sabaki).

I found some of the moves in pro games, others just look natural to me (these are probably the bad ones ;-) ).

My intention was not to look for the best solution, but to give you an idea on how to play lightly.]

(;W[kd]C[[jfc\] I think this move should be at O8.  Black O8 is very hard for white

[prana\] I agree. 
This is the first really bad move in the game.
You must strenghten your bottom group.
If the bottom group is solid, you can think about reducing the black territoty or attack the bottom black group later.
The difference is huge.]
(;B[cq]C[[prana\] Wrong direction. This weakens the black stones on the bottom.]

First, settle the bottom.];B[co];W[do];B[cp];W[ck]C[[jfc\] I think white C9 is questionable because of the black cut at D6.

[prana\] I agree. It is not sente on the upper left group.

[prana\] Yes, W is in trouble. 
You should have played q9 before. It is sente.

But I think, it stil cannot be killed.

(;W[qj]LB[op:A]C[[jfc\] is this better than whie Q17?

later I was dissatisfied with the result of my invasion at 'A'.  My opponent and I both thought R10 gave a better result than what happened in the game.

[prana\]
R10 is an excellent move. It gives you a foothold within blacks framework. It has nice extension up and down.

But in my opinion Q17 is also possible.]))
