C[solipsist: Hi

Hi Bilgo,

my name is Rainer (8k). I did this review and hope you will find it helpful for your future games. My comments are marked R:

Basically you should always keep in mind that Go is a territorial game. Battles will of course occur from time to time at the borders of territories or if one player tries to invade the opponents moyo. But to fight is not the underlying motion in this game. Try to protect what you have before you try to invade in your opponents moyo. In the end the player with the bigger territory will win...
Also try not to waste moves. Try to figure out how your opponent will react to your moves. You will get better at this if you play more often :-)

See you around

C[solipsist: welcome !

[kq]C[Bilgo: : )

R: Next Black wants to play an extension to his corner enclosure. So a possibility would be to play there first :-)]
;W[nc]CR[jc][qi][cj][cn][dn][jq]C[R: This move is too small. There are more important places to play.]
;B[jq];W[lq]C[R: It's a bit early for you to dive this deep into the moyo of Black. Either you help him build his territory or get killed.]
;B[gq];W[jp];B[cf];W[di]LB[fc:A][jd:B]C[R: Another possibility would be to play at A and later at B...]

;W[cj]C[Bilgo: be right back];B[cg];W[dh];B[bd];W[bi]TR[ch]
[dh][di][cj]C[R: The marked group is alive. Now it would be good to put some pressure on Blacks group.]
;B[ee];W[ed]C[R: This is a defensive move to protect territory on the upper side.]
;B[de];W[fe]C[R: Good. You keep Black at bay and build a moyo on the top.]
;B[cb];W[fd]TR[cb]C[R: Not a good move if you still try to build some territory on the upper side. Black has a foothold you have to block.]
;B[cd];W[db]C[R: Ok];B[cc];W[dc]C[R: Either try to lock Black in the corner and deny him entry to the center or/and secure your own territory on the top.]
;B[df];W[ef]C[R: This is no move to lock Black in the corner. Black could get out...]
;B[ff];W[eg]C[R: Black is shut in the corner, now it is time to secure your territory on the upper side of the board.]
;B[gh];W[fg]C[R: Wrong direction.];B[gf]C[Bilgo: where are u from?
solipsist: canada.  you ?];W[dg]C[R: Not necessary. You are save and Black is alive.]
;B[gg]C[Bilgo: I am from China
solipsist: you are Chinese ?];W[bg]C[Bilgo: yes];B[bf]C[Bilgo: are you?]
;W[ah]C[solipsist: no.  I'm Canadian, but I'm a teacher and I sometimes teach Franch to Chinese-Canadians
solipsist: French];B[kf]C[R: Black is getting strong in the center.]

[dd][ed][fd][fe]C[R: The marked group looks strong, but it is still vulnerable. Better to play there to build territory and strengthen your position.]
