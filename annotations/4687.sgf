C[Thank you for reviewing my game.  I am playing as white.  Mainly I would like help on my major attack and also on endgame reductions that I feel could have been better.  Please try to ignore a couple really stupid moves on both our parts.

Thanks again.

Hello,

My name is Philip and I am an AGA 1 dan. I'll mark my comments with "P:"]
;B[pd];W[do];B[pp];W[dd];B[hd]C[He's aiming at a moyo?

P: This move is strange, i.e. not joseki. The general principle is that if your opponent makes a strange, non-joseki move, you must respond, else he may get a good result.]
;W[gc]LB[df:B][hc:A]C[Too rash or is this playable?

P: Too rash. You are forcing him to descend to A, which is good for him. Just playing B seems fine.]
;B[hc];W[gd];B[he];W[dg]C[P: The problem with this is that black has a nice wall, and white's corner is still open to invasion.]
;B[ld];W[qg]LB[dq:C][nq:B][qj:A]C[No double-wing.

P: This approach is wrong. White should consider one of the marked moves instead.]
;B[og]LB[qe:A]C[P: If black plays A here, he will get a good result. This way, the corner is still too vulnerable.]
;W[qj];B[qm];W[oj];B[om];W[nq]LB[dq:B][qc:A]C[P: White seems to be playing too close to thickness. Invading at A would be big, also enclosing the corner at B is big.]
;B[pq]C[P: Good.];W[jp];B[gq]C[P: This move is strange. White should be happy to enclose the corner here.]
;W[dq]C[Should this be closer?

P: This is correct.];B[lq]C[Please help me with this attack.]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[kq];B[mq];W[go]C[Correct beginning?

P: Yes, I like this sequence for white.];B[ho];W[hp];B[gp];W[ip]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[fm];W[ep]LB[gl:A]C[P: White should extend at A first.]
;B[gl];W[hn];B[fp];W[dl];B[el];W[dk];B[hl]C[ I think he has much more severe moves]
;W[in];B[lo];W[fk];B[ek];W[ej]LB[fj:A]C[P: Just extend to A here.]
;B[fj];W[gk]C[P: This is too much. White should be happy to just turn the left side into territory. Black is gaining nothing in this fight.]
;B[fl];W[gj];B[fi];W[ij];B[gi];W[ik];B[di]C[no fighting spirit?]

(;W[ch];B[dm];W[bl];B[jk]LB[ii:A]C[This is where I messed up - please help

I thought of the branch, but not the other move.

P: White should play at A here. See variation.]

(;W[ji];B[hj]C[
darn];W[ii];B[hk];W[hg]LB[gb:B][qc:A]C[next couple of moves are pointless

P: White should play one of the marked points. B is quite large because it reduces black, while also providing some protection against a 3-3 invasion at C17.]
;B[if];W[gk];B[hi]C[P: Black can tenuki, of course.];W[qc]C[P: Very good.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf]
(;W[cc]LB[qb:A]C[is this correct?  I am not sure about the timing

P: This is the right idea. The descent to G18 would be a better way to protect the corner however. See variation. R18 is also very large.]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[fr];W[dr]C[E2 or no?

P: E2 is slightly better.];B[ge];W[gb]C[P: Good.];B[hb];W[fe]
;B[ig];W[lg];B[le]LB[ga:A][qb:B]C[I think I got lucky here from scaring him.  It would have been really close otherwise - thus me submitting it at all

P: Black has much larger moves with A and B.];W[kg];B[fg];W[ff]
;B[gf];W[df]LB[qb:A]C[P: Playing at A is quite big.];B[lf];W[mg]
;B[ga];W[eb]C[could I have just f19?  I couldn't read fast enough

P: F19 is fine.]
(;B[pi]C[I messed up with this sequence

P: See variation.];W[qi]C[P: This is a "thank you" move, since it eliminates the bad aji shown in the variation. White has gained a lot here.]

;W[ck];B[tt];W[tt]C[Thank you again and I look forward to your comments.

P: Overall, this is a good game by white. It seems that white is strong at local fights. Some things to work on would be direction of play and the opening. The opening is easy in that there are many basic principles you can follow in order to learn it. These can be picked up from either studying professional games or reading books on fuseki and joseki. Direction of play is more difficult. By this I mean deciding on which direction to attack from, when to defend, and concepts like this. An important principle is to attack with the purpose of gaining territory, not with the purpose of killing. In my opinion, this skill is best gained through playing experience.]
