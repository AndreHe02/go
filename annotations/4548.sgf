AB[dd][dp][jj][pd][pp]C[M: Hi ! Im Masacroso from KGS, I think I dont played very bad this game but anyway I lose in the last moves. I want to see what I didnt correctly; I feel that my opponent didnt their best and anyway he win :( Later, reviewing the game I see some useless moves but considering that I played with 5 handicap stones and my opponent dont play astounding moves I feel that I lose not only for make little moves, I want to know about moves for a better direction of play. I go to make comments about the moves that I think were little or bad. Thanks in advance for your time reviewer!

P.S.: sorry by my english, feel free to correct my words ;)

Hi,
My name is Avi Ben-Nun. and I am a 3K player on IGS, so I am not that strong to give you definite answers - but I will do my best.
My comments will be frefixed with "A:".
My summary is at the end of the game.
Enjoy!];W[pm]C[A: White's approach is not usual - the more common approach is R6. This means that White puts more emphasis on central influence, on account of settling a base.]
;B[pj]C[A: In view of the previous comment, may be a better direction is O4. The reason is simple: The corner is bigger than the side.]
;W[np];B[oo]C[M: Maybe a bad move or hard to pull off correctly, my idea was separate white stones or complicate their developtment forcing to white to attack the corner that I was ready to defend.

A: I think it is a good move.];W[nm];B[nj]C[A: This is not consistent - you said you wanted to split White, so you should have continued with O5! O10 is too vague - it allows White to connect, and does not close the territory on the other side.]
;W[mo];B[qn]C[M: surely a bad move, if i dont remember bad this shape isnt very good, maybe better P7/R7 to attack white?

A: I agree R6 is odd shape - it just invites the R7 block. Q2 is better.]
;W[qm];B[oq]C[A: This move is also bad shape - Q2 is better.]
;W[nq];B[gq];W[fc];B[df];W[nc];B[ne]C[A: I do not like O15 - it induces White to play in the direction of F17 and take territory on top. It is true that Black make territory as well, but it is easier to take territory on the side (top) than in the middle.
I would play the pincer at M17, which splits White and force him to fight - Black is strong in this area, so he should not play passively.]
;W[kc];B[ke];W[qf]C[A: White prove to black here that it is not easy to make territory in the middle...]
;B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[od]C[M: maybe a very little or unnecesay move, surely C10/D10 or similar are better choices

A: This move is playing safe, so it is maybe OK. But look how White too over the top side in an area that was dominated by Black...]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[cn];B[cp];W[ek];B[ei];W[en];B[jq];W[qo]C[A: White explouts the bad shape of Black]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[po];W[rn];B[rp];W[je]C[M: I seems that this move from white was a very good move and I dont knew how to counterattack later this move, if you see the end of the game I think this move let the victory to white more than others moves, maybe better a change in my direction of play? I played L14 to defend my territory but maybe better another move?]
;B[kf];W[jd];B[jf]C[A: K14 is small. If you want to reduce White's top, H16 is better. But there are other big points: D18, M2, even G5.]
;W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[M: I know that the empty triangle is bad shape but later seeing posibles secuences I find this the best move that I could do, anyway, do you can show me better moves?

A: Bad play. Black is strong enough to hold here - E4 and then G4 will capture the invading stones.]

;W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[cd];W[cb];B[er]C[M: this was another little move, bigger moves to do :(

A: Correct...];W[rj];B[ri];W[qj];B[qi];W[pk];B[oj];W[gf];B[fe]
;W[ge];B[fd];W[gd];B[ih];W[dh];B[ch]C[M: later reviewing the game I see that this move was very soft, surely playing D11 is better, I was thinking about play the more safe posible because I feel that I was winning by a little]

Points for improve:
- Selection of direction to play
- Selection of big moves versus small points
- Shape and life and death situations])
