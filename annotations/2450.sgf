;B[pd]C[RickMott: Hi, Lothar.  Perfect play so far! :)
I will try to give you some general principles as well
as specific tactical tips, but joseki aren't the strongest
part of my game.

One thing I can say is that you need to think harder about sente.
Strong players' games are a continuous struggle over sente;
you have to be aware of it at all times, and keep it as long as
you can whenever you get it, especially in the endgame.

Your opening is pretty good, but in middle game fighting you
are reluctant to let your opponent have anything.  You feel a
need to jump into the middle of his potential territory, often
before securing your own, and the resulting fighting damages
your neighboring position.  Learn to count the game as you go,
and if you are ahead, play simplifying moves that settle areas
rather than complicated invasions you can't read out.

You've improved 3 stones in 3 months, though.  That's good progress!]
;W[dd];B[dp]C[RickMott: If you're going to choose a diagonal opening, that usually
results in a fighting game without large moyos.  Therefore, on your
second corner, you should probably play 3-3 or 4-3 rather than 4-4.
Having both players stay on the 4th line in all corners is unusual
for a diagonal opening.];W[pp];B[cf];W[fc]C[RickMott: This is not best for white.  You should slide at B16 right away;
white is overconcentrated after defending the 3-3 point.];B[di]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[RickMott: Good.  The "standard" play of F4 doesn't work here, because you don't want white to get the
ideal extension at C9 with the slide at B11 as a followup.  That would make you overconcentrated.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[qf]C[RickMott: Hmmm.  Not sure white should leave his two stones in the lower left yet.
You should probably ignore his approach and do something to take away white's
potential to make a base in the lower left: C5, C4, maybe even B5.  White will have
to run, taking no territory and not threatening you in the least because you have
strong positions on both sides, while you can build strength chasing him.]
;B[nc]C[RickMott: and if you do respond, you should play on the 4th line.  
Same argument as for white in the upper left; if black slides and
you block at 3-3, you are overconcentrated.];W[ic];B[qh]C[RickMott: Ok, but better to slide at B16 first.  White should respond.]
;W[og]C[RIckMott: White is too weak locally to try a leaning attack.  You should separate him at Q14 immediately.
You have the advantage in the resulting fight.  See variation for one plausible sequence.]

(;B[pk]C[RickMott: I think a 3rd-line extension is better.  This makes a white long-knight's move at R7
sente, because of the good followup at S9 for white.  The top extension he actually played
is OK, but playing R7 first might be better.];W[lc]C[RickMott: Small gote move.  I don't think black is forced to defend the corner.]
;B[qd]C[RickMott: But you did anyway, so white keeps sente.
I think you should ignore white's approach, because his
two stones on the upper right are two weak to support
an invasion of your corner.  You should (a) attack white's
lower left group, or (b) approach white's lower right
corner.  Either would be big, and put you comfortably
in the lead.  White has two weak groups and should
be at a disadvantage.];W[jp]C[RickMott: 4th line is probably not best for white here.  There's not much chance of moyo-building;
this is a game of fighting and small territories.];B[qn]C[RickMott: Ok, good, this strengthens your right-side group and threatens to slide into the corner.]
;W[rp];B[lq]C[RickMott: I don't think invading now is your best choice.  After the resulting fighting,
you may have to make a defensive move in the lower left or white's weak stones there
may have somewhere to run.

I would slide at H3 first, which does 3 things: (1) strengthens your lower left group,
(2) supports a future invasion/reduction of white's lower right, and (3) helps in a
future attack on white's two stones.

White is then faced with unpleasant choices.  If he defends the lower right, your
attack on the lower left is more severe.  If he chooses to make a base or run
with the lower left stones, you will do more damage to his lower right with a
strong position nearby after chasing his lower-right stones.]
;W[hq];B[cp];W[no];B[oq]C[RickMott: Wow.  You seem way ahead now.  I don't see how white can kill you, so
his entire territory is destroyed.  All he has left is the upper left.  How did you manage
to lose from here?  You should be playing to simplify the positions from now on.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[lo];B[pq]C[RickMott: This push is not good.  Generally, when trying to live inside, a slide (R2) is better.
You might want to slide on the left at K2 first, because it's sente; if white doesn't respond,
you can cut off the H3 stone.  Then play R2.  White is left with nothing.]
;W[qq];B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rn];B[qm]
;W[rm];B[rl]C[mistake..

RickMott: Not necessarily   If White cuts, you can capture.  See variation
on the following move.];W[ql]
(;B[qo]C[bigger mistake..

RickMott: Yes, making an empty triangle is bad here.  Giving up the Q5 stone in the
variation on move 44 is much better.  You want your Q9-R12 stones to stay strong
so you can attack white's two stones above.];W[rk]C[RickMott: Try the cut at R9.  See variation.]

(;B[ro]C[and one more...

RickMott: Yes, cutting at R9 is better.  If white extends at Q8, you keep him
in atari until he is forced to capture your S8 stone, then connect.  See variation.]
;W[so];B[pl];W[qk];B[qj]C[it doesnt stop...

RickMott: This is not necessarily wrong.  I think maintaining the
possibility of attacking white's two stones above is worth more than
the 10 points you give up by allowing white to capture 5 stones.
After all, he has spent a great many moves to get them.];W[pm]
;B[pj]C[RickMott: But you should atari at S10 in sente before connecting.
Then make a double tiger's mouth with Q11 rather than Q10.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[ne];B[md]C[RickMott: Good!  I like this move; keeping pressure on the three white
stones is very important.];W[gn];B[hp]C[RickMott: This is a difficult attack, because white's stones on the right are
connected to his corner when he captures your 5 stones.

This contact move will strengthen white locally.  I would be more
inclined to take territory with F2 or G2.];W[ip];B[ho]C[RickMott: Good, keeping white separated.]
;W[fl];B[ek]C[RickMott: the white stones won't be easy to kill.  I would slide at K2
in sente, securing life for your bottom right and threatening to cut at J3,
and then take solid territory with G3.  Take your profit now!  You are
still ahead in territory; even with the loss in the lower right side.  Play
to simplify the game.];W[fk];B[me]C[RickMott: Good idea, but better to settle at the bottom first.]
;W[ng];B[ni];W[lg];B[ke];W[bd]C[RickMott: Ouch.  This was a really big move for both sides, and white got
it first.];B[kc]C[RickMott: You really have to respond in the upper left, otherwise white
can reduce your left-side territory by quite a bit.  White should give up
the M17 stone, because you've spent 3 or 4 moves to get it.  A white
invasion at C12, for example, would be difficult to handle.]
;W[kb]C[RickMott: but he defends locally, so you get another chance.]
;B[jc]C[RickMott: Both players are making small moves.  This area is not
important compared to the upper left and bottom, where both
sides can make or destroy lots of territory.];W[jb];B[ld]C[RickMott: This move is not necessary, even locally.]
;W[mc];B[lb];W[mb];B[ib]C[RickMott: What are you thinking here?  You must defend your corner with
the sente atari at O18.];W[id]C[RickMott: white misses the chance to destroy your corner with O18.   The J18 cut is
an overplay, and will be captured even if white doesn't defend J17.]
;B[nb]C[RickMott: so you get to save the corner anyway.  Lucky... :)]
;W[la];B[je]C[RickMott: Bottom and left side are still bigger.  Are you worried about the cut at
O16? Then protect it indirectly by playing P15, preventing white from making a
bamboo joint and threatening cuts at Q14 and O14.  By making this play, you
encourage the white cut at O16 and create unnecessary complications.]
;W[hb]C[RickMott: This is a white mistake.  He doesn't need this play to capture the stone.
He should cut at O16 and fight, hoping to settle his weak stones in the upper right,
reduce your corner., and attack the top-center group.];B[kh]
C[RickMott:  Aha!  The gauntlet is thrown down.  But you have some weakness to worry
about...];W[nd]C[RickMott: Good start by white.];B[od];W[kg]
C[RickMott: Mistake by white.  See variation.]
(;B[jg]C[RickMott: If you can't read the whole killing sequence out (I can't either :),
this may be a bit risky for someone who's ahead on the board.  Depending
on how this fighting goes, there's a risk that white may succeed in attacking
your top-center group, which doesn't have two eyes yet.

White made a mistake by not making the double tiger's mouth at N14 on
his last move; you can play there immediately and either capture two stones
or capture more if white tries to escape.];W[jh];B[lh]C[RickMott: Wrong direction to extend.  If you're going to fight here, extend at L11 instead.]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[if];B[kf];W[mh];B[li]C[RickMott: The empty triangle is bad shape; N11, preventing the white push there,
is better.];W[mi];B[lj];W[mj]C[RickMott: This looks scary.  White may have an attack on your center-right
group, and has a lot of liberties now.];B[mk];W[nk];B[lk];W[nl]
C[mistake by white];B[nj]
(;W[pi]C[RickMott: This was not the best attacking move for white.  He could possibly win
here.  See variation (from last move).];B[nh];W[mg];B[ph];W[ie]
;B[nf]C[RickMott: Good reading.];W[oe];B[of];W[pe];B[pf];W[qe]
;B[mf];W[ji];B[hg];W[ob];B[oc];W[pb]C[RickMott: Overplay by white!  Descend to O19 and separate  You will have 5 liberties plus the
attack on white's eyeless group.  What can he do???];B[re]C[RickMott: extending at S16 is better.]
;W[rf];B[rc];W[se];B[rd];W[jd];B[pg]C[unnecessary, better O19

RickMott: yes.  But how many points?  Maybe 10.    Go back to a sequence
I spoke of earlier, and slide at K2 in sente (if white responds by connecting
at O19, the cut at J3 is worth much more).  If white does respond at the
bottom, making corner territory in the lower left is probably as valuable
as O19 in gote.];W[na]C[RickMott: Gote; look for sente!];B[rg]
C[unnecessary...];W[rb];B[sd]C[and once again an unnecessary move...]
;W[jm]C[RickMott: Black is now enormously ahead.  How did you manage to lose
from this position?  K2 (sente) and G2 or F2 and the game should be
over.];B[ik]C[RickMott: Only 10 points even if you capture.  Settle yourself at the bottom
first.];W[il];B[hi]C[RickMott: When your opponent plays contact, extend.  This way, he can connect out
with K9 and you cannot prevent it.];W[fi];B[mm]C[mistake... better somewhere else like K9.. or G3

RickMott: or K2... :)];W[ml];B[lm]C[RickMott: This is just giving away a stone and making white stronger.]
;W[ll];B[om];W[pn];B[nm]C[RickMott: Forget the two stones, connect at P8 in sente]
;W[kl];B[ol];W[kj];B[lf];W[fg];B[oh]C[given the number of mistakes I already made I felt it was better to be safe then sorry.

RickMott: Making unnecessary moves because you're afraid you'll forget them
won't make you stronger.  Wait until you are forced to capture, if you are.  Strong
players' games are fought mainly over sente, so giving it up at this stage of the
game is very bad.  K2!  It's not as big as Mt. Everest, but almost... :)]
;W[kk]C[RickMott: Very small move, gote, so you get another chance.]
;B[jj]C[RickMott: Giving away a stone.  White can capture this with J10, so it's worse than
a pass.  You have to focus on the uncompleted boundaries between black and
white territories, not fights over a couple of points.  Get Janice Kim's 5th volume
and study, study, study the end-game estimation techniques!  It will help you a lot.]
;W[ki]C[RIckMott: Fortunately, white keeps answering you, and even misses J10.   But the first player to awaken
from the local-fighting trance will have the advantage.];B[ii]
C[RickMott: A little bigger, maybe 6-7 points, but still gote...]
;W[dk];B[ej]C[RickMott: Don't try to save the clamped stone; focus on your edge territory.
C9 both protects your territory and threatens to capture the clamping stone.]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj]C[RickMott: You still have to give up E9, and you added E10 for dessert. :)]
;W[ei];B[dh];W[eg];B[ce]C[RickMott: This is a "thank-you" move, making white connect and still leaving
him the mokey jump.  It will end in gote, without making you any territory.]
;W[cd];B[gf]C[RickMott: Good move!  Destroying potential white territory.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ee];B[dm]C[too early better to play G3 first, but as you will have noticed I didn't really read it out at all..]
;W[el];B[dn]C[RickMott:   Also good!  But if you play K2 first, you probably win, because
this, although big, will end in gote.];W[eo];B[do]C[RickMott: Oops.  Wrong peep to connect.  Should be E4.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[gq];W[fr];B[iq]C[mistake (again) G2 of course

RickMott: Yes.  This was probably the losing move; it's a huge swing, 20+ points.
If you catch white's cutting stones, he can't win.];W[hr];B[jq]
C[RickMott: I like E2 better.  Protect the corner in sente.  White must answer.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[cr];W[kq];B[kr];W[kp];B[jr];W[hk];B[gj]
C[RickMott: Looks like sente, but if white plays H10 you cannot connect.

Real sente plays: S1, D1, T18, E7.   Also A15, preventing the money jump, is worth
more than the 4 points you would save if white ignored G10.  So white should
play B13 now (after playing R17 in sente, of course).];W[fj]
;B[gk];W[gl]C[RIckMott: Now white gives up sente.  R17 would be big, with A13 as a follwoup.]
;B[ge]C[RickMott: White can ignore this; this area won't be territory for either side.]
;W[gc];B[be]C[RickMott: Big point, but take D1 and T19 first in sente.]
;W[kn]C[RickMott: This would have been good for you, too.];B[em]
C[RickMott: Good!];W[fn];B[fm]C[RickMott: Not sente, white can ignore you.]
;W[gm];B[fh]C[RickMott: Dame point.  White shouldn't answer.]
;W[eh];B[gh];W[gg]C[RickMott: Ouch.  It was worse than dame; if you save it, white threatens to get
double atari at G11 or cut off your two stones at H14.  Big loss.]
;B[hf]C[RickMott: correct choice.];W[gi];B[hj];W[hh];B[ih];W[gd]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[ok]C[RickMott: one-point gote.  You have to learn to look for sente at the edge; the difference
between black D1 and white C1 is 4 points plus retaining sente for both sides!]
;W[km];B[sj];W[sk];B[si];W[kd]C[ouch 4 points that in the end will cost me the game since I lost by 2.5 points..]
;B[ds];W[er];B[ch]C[RickMott: You could get your 2.5 points back right here, by playing A18 in sente
followed by T1 in sente.  This connection is not needed.];W[fe]
;B[ef]C[RickMott: What are you thinking?  This is not a point for either side.  You give up sente.]
