C[I played White in this game.

This game was played on the Dragon Go Server (www.dragongoserver.net). It was played over three months, at a rate of a few moves each day. As such, you will probably not see as many mistakes as you would in a real-time game. But nonetheless, I know there are mistakes, and that you will be able to help point them out and analyse them. I have put in a fair few comments and questions that I would like you to address if possible, but I am most interested in the issues that I can not even see with the benefit of hind-sight: tactical or strategic mistakes that I did not see, opportunities that were missed, and different ways of looking at things. Also, feel free to comment on Black's play, as I'm sure that he will also read this review.

Thanks again for your time and effort in doing this review.]

;B[dg];W[nc]LB[ch:B][ci:A]C[In hindsight, d13 is overconcentrated, but does put more pressure on the top left White group, which is thin. Perhaps this was not a good time to tenuki.

reid: D13 is indeed odd.  And while I agree that tenuki may naot be appropriate, it's for entirely different reasons.  But let's back up a bit first.

Two moves ago, white had a choice of B18 or E18 to continue the joseki.  B18 is appropriate when white wants to undermine black's eye shape at attack the D15 stones.  It is often seen when black is invading a white left-side moyo (like if white already has C11 due to a Chinese-style fuseki).  It's difficult to say at white move 10 if those stone will really be attackable or not, so white E18 is probably more common in this position.

However, black responds with D13, which doesn't seem to be any kind of joseki move.  Now white has a chance to turn the B18 move into a reat attacking move.  A white approach at A (C11) would be very fierce now.  Black will almost certainly help white take territory on the upper and left sides as he tries to find some footing for this floating group.

Of course, black would be better off just playing joseki with A or B.

White 12 (O17) is not bad, but it misses an opportunity.];B[pf]
LB[ci:B][cj:E][ck:C][cl:D][cn:A]C[reid: Black could fix his problem by playing A (C6) now.  If next white B, black C is a better fight for black than for white.  If instead white D, black can counter-pincer with E (the three-three invasion is C3 is still available for black).]
;W[pb]C[reid: white should still play at C11.  The O17-Q14 play leaves the 3-3 invasion at R17 available for white, so he doesn't need to rush to finish this joseki.  Especially since it is difficult to find a comfortable spot for white's next move after black responds here at R16.]
;B[lc]C[Of course, if Black had played r17, I would be very happy. I think m17 is pretty good, and looking back on it now, I wish I'd played r17 to secure this group so that I only had one slightly weak group to worry about.

OK, there are three pointss I'd like to make regarding your reaction (above), and your play.  (First), I am happy that black played M17 because (second) I was afraid he would play R17!  Just the oppposite of your reaction :-)  And (third) next white *must* play R17.

There are two variations here for the first two points, and the last one should become clear as we proceed throught the next few moves.]

(;W[ne]C[The reason for this move, in my mind, was to attack the m17 stone, which is surrounded by White stones. In hindsight, I think that can not be a very strong attack, and the q18 r17 exchange takes away my chance to jump into the corner.

reid: Exactly right.  And you'll see in my comments on move Black 29 how it should have turned out even worse for white than it did.]
;B[qc]C[reid: This is the correct move to punish white for O15.  Now the white stones are heavy and a burden.]
;W[kd]LB[ic:A]C[Is there perhaps a better way to attack here? With this move, I'm sort of blindly following the idea from the low approach / one space low pincer idea.

reid: Because of the exchange of Q18 for R17, white can't really counter-pincer around A: the white group is just too heavy.  However, without the Q18/R17 exchange, that's still an option because the jump into the 3-3 is still available to white.

By the way, there's a little known ladder involved with L16,  see the variation]

(;B[kc];W[jd];B[ld];W[le];B[jc];W[id]C[H16 better?

reid: After H16, how do you respond to L15?  That's why J16 is joseki.]
;B[hc]C[Couldn't Black split White apart straight away with n15? Are the Black stones under so much pressure?

reid: yes, but H17 is still sente, it's large in points, and it undermines the black eye-space.  In contrast, black N15 now is just points in gote.  And it helps white build his strong wall, which could have adverse consequences for the D13 group.]
;W[hd];B[gc]C[Was this exchange (h16 for g17) worthwhile?

reid: It's reverse sente.  If white tenukis, black can mount a very severe splitting attack with H16.  Neither white group is very stable, so white needs to connect them or strengthen them somehow.]
;W[fc]C[I'm not happy with the result here. My move does not put enough pressure on the top group to be sente. Really, it is a small defensive move, and still I have a lot of cutting points in my shape.

reid: Yes, I'd say that's accurate.  I'd even go a bit further and say that black has just about won this game already.  Looking at the board, we see that the bottom half is even, but in the top half, black has easily 30 points while white has less than 15 (being rather generous).  And as you say, white has a number of weak points while black has almost none.]
;B[cn]C[reid: black takes sente to help his D13 group while attacking the corner.  Good.

N15 would also be big, and also reverse sente.  I think I'd prefer to play N15 taking about 15 points in reverse sente because white cannot press the D13 group too hard with all his cutting points in that wall.]
;W[ci]C[Perhaps this is not "playing away from thickness" (Black looks fairly strong above). But the combination of d13 and c6 seemed to suggest a two-space extention from c11 to c8, and I also wanted to use my thickness above to attack the Black stones in this area by playing e11 if I got a chance.

reid: Ah, but your 'thickness' has a few problems.  This could be risky.  On the other hand, when you're behind, you have to try to stir things up, gamble a bit.]
;B[ck]C[reid: Black responds patiently.  White is really going to have his hands busy here.]
;W[ei]C[Now the black stones above look weak. I think from here I should be able to attack them profitably.]
;B[fg];W[gd]C[Now I think this is too slow. Black splits me apart where I am weak and starts attacking me.

reid: Perhaps, but the fault is really that white was behind to start with (before C11).]
;B[md]C[reid: Ah! black gives white a chance!];W[nd]LB[gh:A]
[gi:B]C[reid: But white fails to take it!  In fact, by connecting, white makes life even harder for the E11 stones.

O17 and Q18 aren't doing anything for white.  They are just a burden, and white should welcome the chance to dispose of them.  You would love for black to make another move at O16 to take them.

Instead, white should attack with A or B.];B[me];W[nf]C[reid: Ouch.]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[mf]C[Ouch. When was the appropriate time and what was the best way to have avoided this? And did I have any other option apart from o16 in response to n16? Now is the time when I wish q18/r17 weren't on the board, because I could jump into the corner.

reid: Yes, I think it's all a lot clearer for you now.  Sometimes the painful lessons are the most useful.]
;W[ng];B[ph]C[Drat. Black is making territory while attacking.

reid: And he can do that because you so nicely gave him groups to attack :-)

Actually, now black is even further ahead than before, and white has three, almost four groups that are ripe for attack.  By rights, white should lose this game by 100 points.  That you brought it back to 2.5 must be due to some miraculous intervention.

I'm going to end my commentary here.  I hope you can get some idea of the kinds of things to be thinking about in the early parts of the game.  It is very important not to worry too much about territory in the first 80 moves or so.  You should be thinking a lot more about strength and weakness, attack and defence, and the relationships of stones and groups.  Make sure all your stones are working together, and avoid putting down stones that will lose their effectiveness.

Every move is critical!  In this game, Q18 was the starting point for a whole sequence of problems.

Good luck, and regards,

I think I played a good late endgame. I certainly tried hard enough. My opponent said that he thought it was quite an even game all along, but I think he played a very good opening and early middle game, and I slowly caught up to a fairly even result. Is this an accurate analysis? What were the major mistakes that Black made?

As I said at the beginning, there is no aspect of my game that I am not interested in or that I do not want to improve, so everything that you can say will be appreciated. And of course, I am most interested in the issues that I did not even know enough to address.

Actually, after Q18/R17, this may still be OK for black - he can atari at N15 and then connect to kill the O17 and Q18 stones (or better, just play N15 directly instead of sacrificing L15).  If Q18/R17 are not yet played, white can live in the corner after black N15, etc, so sacrificing L15 is not good for black.]

PL[B];B[qc]LB[hc:C][kc:B][lc:D][ld:A][nd:E][qn:F]C[Now white must extend to either A or B.

A clearly leaves a big hole - black can jump anywhere into the top side and give the white stones on both sides a hard time.  So it seems like white really has to play at B.  But even that leaves C for black to exploit, so white will be uncomfortable (and he'll have a hard time attacking the D13 stones with that weakness left behind).  Also, black seems to be building up the right hand side, and white B gives black a chance to play A, white C, black D (perhaps after black gets a chance to play in the lower right corner around F).

So this is why I am afraid black will defend the corner.])
(;W[qc]C[When black pincers, I am happy to play at R17.  All my concerns about white extending along the upper side have just been erased.

Black chooses this pincer when he wants a wall facing down and somwhat to the left/center.  But white will be able to remove a lot of that wall's influence while at the same time preparing for an attack on the D13 group.  Here's how the joseki goes:]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[md]LB[hc:D][ic:A][rc:G][rd:F][re:B][ci:E][qk:C]
C[To here, white takes the corner and sente.  So now he can play at A, B, or C to reduce Black's wall.  Probably A is best since that removes black's severe attack at D.  It also makes black a bit nervous about a white follow-up attack at E.

Black of course gets a forcing move at F sometime in the very near future, but white just answers at G.]
