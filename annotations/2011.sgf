Hi,
I'm Black in this game.  I already went over some parts with my opponent, but I'd like some additional input.  There are already some variations in this SGF file.
Thanks in advance,
Bernd
Reviewer:Hi, I am a go-lover with 3 or 4 handicap stones to the professional players. Now I'll add some couple of points.]

Should Black play elsewhere?  The top left comes to mind, but I'm not entirely sure which move to play there.
R: I think W is living and also B 2stones (D4 andF3) are living. Å@Çsherefore, you must search W weak point.
As D17 stone is single, the stone is a good target. as attacking points, A or B may be suitable.

This is the situation I'm most interested in receiving comments on.
In retrospect, I don't like any of my available options, so maybe the fault is earlier?
(R: yes b36 was bad )
R:now b have only two selections, i.e. A or B as shown in branch.]

The idea was not to let White easily make a live group; but this was criticised strongly by my opponent.

How would you evaluate this result?
R: B stones were not alive, but all w stones are almost alive, and as territory,  b is somewhat prominent. Therefore, white may be prominent than black.]

Nothing very interesting happened beyond this point; I hallucinated a few liberties during a fight and lost a big group...

My opponent suggested this line of play...];W[re];B[rd];W[sf]
;B[qd]C[
During the game, I rejected this on the grounds that White lives easily, and Black's wall doesn't seem all that useful.  My opponent felt it would have been a good result for Black.]

Better here?  Since I end up playing there anyway, it seems like I don't need the move at F3.

As A is weak point, sooner or later black must lay this location. Therefore, the difference is minor.]
