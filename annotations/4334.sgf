C[Hello reviewer,

I play black in this game and thanks for the review

Most of my question is on opening.  I think my opening is still has many problems.

Please also comment my bad move];B[pd]C[Suzan007: Hello~!];W[pp]

;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[qf]C[Personally i would respond to R14, because you can still approch Q4 on both sides, or pincer if you are worried about a right side moyo]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[on]C[How about 3-3?
I am not very sure if this joseki is good in this situation.

This joseki is not recomended unless black doesn't want to invade the 3-3]

;B[pk];W[pl];B[ol];W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[qg]
C[the problem with this joseki is you give away a lot of territory]

(;B[pm]C[and it's gote];W[jq];B[nc]C[I go O17 but should I go E17, E16, F17?
Which corner is better?
Or I should start reduce at K4?

The attack at O17 could be very profitable for white, this move is important, just as the E17 area is, in the K4 area you have the wall to counter any moyo attempts down there]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[cf];W[kc];B[cj]C[What about S16? should black take S16 first? I was worried about white go C12.

S16 isn't too big, i would be more focused on how to make Q12 effective. C10 is a good move

also if you look here there is little white can do to make a moyo here, so there a reduction around K4 earlier would have been pointless.]
;W[rd]C[here you still have the chance to make Q16 a solid group by R17]

pleny has resigned the game.

remember if you had just caught the P13 stone you groups should still be alive.
This game was difficult after your mistake on the left. If it had not happened you wouldn't have had a problem with a weak group in the center. remember even walls can become weak.]
