 Three started observation.];B[on];W[ql]C[A bad move by white. According to Kageyama, Black's hand should be trembling with eagerness to play the next move and punish white. Look at the variation.]

;B[nd];W[mf]C[And white runs off..];B[ld]MA[mk]TR[oj]C[Dangerous.. A play at the point marked with the rectangle would protect the cutting point at the triangled point which has become urgent.. also, black would get room in the center and later a connection to his group at the bottom.]
;W[lg]C[Good.];B[ph]MA[mk]C[Does not threaten anything. Black has to run out at the marked point *now*.]

(;B[oh]TR[ni]C[It is not always good to defend a cutting point like the marked point directly. This move gives black bad shape and he still is not moving out. Look at the variation for two examples of different moves. If possible, your moves should accomplish more than just ensure a connection.]

;W[ed];B[ec];W[dd];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd]TR[be][ce][cf][bf][ae]C[Black should realise that his shape is eyeless! Look at the marked points. That shape should be familiar! Black has to run as quickly as possible.]
;W[bc];B[ac];W[ab];B[ad];W[ba]MA[ef]C[Not necessary. Black can't get an eye by cutting there. White should probably play the marked point, killing black.]
;B[hd]C[Black is not alive on the side..];W[ee];B[bf];W[ce]
;B[df];W[be];B[ef];W[ck];B[dr]C[This move is normally used to settle a group. Black is already strong at the bottom so this is a duplication of effort. All it means is that white gets the corner.. Black should invade at 3-3 instead.]

TR[hn][mm][mj]C[Overplay. White should play fewer invasions :) White is ahead in territory so he should play calmly. Remember that the marked group is dead. White should try and grab some central territory, for example by playing at the marked points. (The top point on the right is sente!)]

;W[ar];B[tt];W[da];B[tt];W[tt]C[Ok, here is my impression of the game, I will try to point out any weaknesses I have found.

Black first: If you look at the board now, what you should notice is that white has taken
four corners, which gives him a lead in territory. It sometimes seemed like Black did not
quite know what to do in corner positions.. Especially the urgent point in the lower right
would have given black an early advantage (and corner territory which is now white..).
Personally, I'd recommend "Get Strong at Joseki", that will give you a very good idea
of good tesujis in the corner in no time. Don't bother spending too much time reading
the variations though (it annoyed me when I was weaker.. :) The other two mistakes black
made was that he neglected to play urgent points and answered some threats too obediently. (Like the connection at P12). Again, playing moves that have more than one
purpose would be a good idea.

White: White did a good job killing the weak black group on the left and getting some central territory. Also, white seemed to try out a few tesujis which cannot be a bad idea.. although they sometimes did not work out (not all clamping moves are good :) Specific weaknesses I seemed to notice include: A lot of unnecessary answers in the endgame (perhaps white was very sure of his win?) that cost quite a few points and too much
invading. Note that while this tactic may win you a game against a weaker player,
you may throw away a large lead against a stronger player. There is only one solution: Estimate your territory before your move. There is a good book called "Positional Judgment" by Cho Chikun that deals with this..

That's it, I hope my comments will prove useful, especially the joseki variations if you did not know them. I've always found it to be a good idea to replay a game like this when I have received comments.. put the stones on the board and then compare the positions to the result of the variations.. it looks very different on a real board :)
