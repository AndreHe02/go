Hi Mat,
You asked me for an estimation of your rank.  Playing on-line is an odd experience, especially if it's somewhere like IGS where ranks are notoriously strong.  When I used to play there regularly, I was 8k* but could enter tournaments in England at 3k and win 3 from 3.  So, be cautious when entering a rank on-line, as black seems to have been here.  He is not as weak as 13k and you are not as strong as 2k, especially not on-line.  I would estimate you as being around 7 or 8k in real life, and Black around 6k. So on-line you might want to try 10k on IGS and see how it goes. On other servers, such as NNGS and Kiseido, ranks tend to be closer to real life. If you win some, fine, if not, drop it down by a couple.

;B[cc]C[[DP\]
A fierce joseki - you need to know the variations if you're going to go in that strongly at C13!  Black's response is the most common. The main routes (apart from that in the game) are given in the branches.]

(;W[cd]C[[DP\]
In the game, you play C16 which is the way to keep your stones connected
[End\]];B[dd];W[ce];B[cf];W[bf]C[[DP\]
and everybody plays by the book up until here...  the standard continuation is in the branch
[End\]]
(;B[df]C[[DP\]
...when black wimps out of the E17 move - if both sides then capture, the result is considered good for black. However, things get quite tricky here - see variation for standard continuation
[End\]]
(;W[bc]C[[DP\]
This is not as effective as E17, since now Black gets that move, keeping sente whilst you are forced to capture, and working very nicely with his two star-point stones on the right hand side.

If instead you get E17 as per the variation, you maintain more of a presence in the centre, which will be useful to counter the influence of those two star-point stones black has played in the fuseki
[End\]];B[be]C[[DP\]
This gains Black nothing - it is in essence a wasted ko threat
[End\]];W[bd];B[ec]C[[DP\]
...and Black regains the initiative he lost when playing E14 instead of E17 earlier
[End\]];W[cb];B[bg];W[ae];B[ch]C[[DP\]
Black has come out of this exchange rather favourably - he is strong on the outside and White is confined to the corner on both sides with no means of escape.

Before playing your next move, you should now consider the whole board position.  Black with outside strength and two star-point stones is getting very strong in the centre, so a move at Q10 or thereabouts should be very high on your priority list. You want to try to avoid making Black any stronger in the top left
[End\]];W[eb]C[[DP\]
...but unfortunately these next two move do just that - you gain a couple of points, whilst Black is constructing his fortress
[End\]];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc]C[I was quite pleased wih this outcome in the top left. Is it good or does black have too much power? If so, how best to counteract ths power at this point? q10? k4? o3, k4 as i played?

[DP\]
Your thoughts are very much on the right lines.  Black has too much power, as you guessed.  Recognizing that and handling it are key steps in moving up the kyu grades.   See variations for some possible lines from your suggested moves.
[end\]]
(;W[nq];B[dg]C[[DP\]
Correct move by Black in response to O3 - this makes him even stronger top left. It is now increasingly important you get some centre influence with a move like Q6 which fits with your sensible strategy of attacking the Q4 stone (away from thickness)
[End\]]
(;W[jp];B[cn]C[[DP\]
Black hasn't quite woken up to the fact that he's sitting on a goldmine yet.  Q10 would work better with his stones all around the board.  But it's not a bad move
[End\]];W[dn]
(;B[dm]C[[DP\]
Black would probably get more profit by pushing away from his thickness, rather than being squeezed back against it - see variation from previous move
[End\]];W[en]C[[DP\]
Good - moving into the centre - don't forget, the reason the centre matters in this game is all to do with the joseki top left at the beginning - that has determined the shape of this game
[End\]];B[cq]C[[DP\]
OK, that's the trade-off - you get centre moves and he gets some corner territory.  Now is the time to consolidate with D3 and E7, and the game will start to come back into balance
[End\]]
(;W[cp]C[[DP\]
As you found out, this doesn't work!  See variation from previous move for an alternative
[End\]];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[fr]C[should i just play f3 here to get my o3 and k4 working better with my d4 group?

[DP\]
Well that would be one way to stop Black getting a position inside your area of influence.  See variation from previous move.  The double hane is a powerful sequence, but the exchange of corner for outside ponnuki is often there for Black and should be in your thoughts before you go down this line
[End\]];B[fq];W[ep];B[gr];W[dr];B[fs];W[cr];B[bo];W[bp]C[[DP\]
You'd be better off simply capturing at B3 here, removing any possible later threat from those stones
[End\]];B[jq];W[cm]C[too early?

[DP\]
Here it is not so much a question of timing as of direction.  Stand back and consider the whole board.  White has 12  points top left, 10 points lower left and virtually no influence / thickness.  Black has influence / thickness at top left and now at lower left with his ponnuki, plus his star point stones.  And although you can nick 10 points or so from Black on the left side, he still has at least 25 remaining there.  So, you're around equal in territory, and way behind in influence.  This should guide you towards a move like Q6 or Q10 instead, to try to restore balance.

There's also the minor detail that C7 doesn't work as you found out around move 51... :-)
[End\]];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[em]C[[DP\]
This is an excellent move, starting to contain the Black influence
[End\]];B[dl];W[fp]C[[DP\]
Unnecessary - you're alive in the corner and you should be playing away from thickness, especially since Black is alive there after he played K3
[End\]]
(;B[gp]C[[DP\]
As Black I would have played H3 instead - see variation from previous move
[End\]];W[hq];B[gq]C[[DP\]
Now you can have a go at Black - J3 hurts as per the variation
[End\]]
(;W[kq]C[[DP\]
Unfortunately this way leads to Black having an unconditionally alive group with more centre influence, as you found out
[End\]];B[hr];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[ip];W[io];B[hp];W[kp];B[oq]
;W[qf]C[is s10 a better landing spot?

[DP\]
Presumably you meant R10?  You weren't seriously thinking about the 2nd line were you? :-)  I'd actually prefer Q10 still - it's that old thickness problem.  But also, you have left an important move unplayed at bottom right - O4 will gain Black a lot on the right.
[End\]]
(;B[qh]LB[qh:A][hq:B]C[[DP\]
I suspect Black would get a lot more profit if he squashed you here with Q14 to use thickness, or even better P14 to avoid shape-making contact moves.  See variations from previous move]
;W[of]C[[DP\]
Good, this starts to negate Black's thickness - though it will be tough for White!
[End\]];B[oh];W[nd];B[ne]
(;W[od]C[o14 to help l3 group?

[DP\]
I'd push through at P15 instead and capture in a ladder, using *your* thickness!  See variaion from previous move
[End\]];B[pe]
(;W[pc]C[[DP\]
I don't think you should sacrifice both P14 and R14, since it give Black too much thickness on the right. I would connect at P15 as per the (many!) variations from the previous move.]
;B[oe]C[[DP\]
Black is taking his profit now
[End\]];W[qc];B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[rf]
(;W[no]C[[DP\]
Good use of sente - N16 would also have been good but I think I prefer your direction, since the work top right has reduced the top left influence sufficiently and you're now playing in the most important part of the board.  However, O4 is the key point, not O5 - Black can push through.  See variation from previous move and note how N2 is also protected
[End\]];B[nr]
(;W[pm]C[took me some time to come up with this. what do you think?

[DP\]
Urgent moves before big moves.  The group on the lower side is under severe attack and needs defence.  The sequence is difficult because N2 does not work. See variations from previous move

(;W[qk]C[[DP\]
Oops - S7 is the key point here to defend a rather large number of cutting points!  You might want to investigate what happens with other defences - I think this is the only one that works
[End\]];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[so]C[[DP\]
This has been a good sequence for Black, robbing you of the corner and getting 10 points there himself, so probably around a 20pt play
[End\]];B[qr];W[sq]C[[DP\]
Tiny - these are endgame moves and the whole centre needs dealing with
[End\]];B[pq]C[[DP\]
but luckily Black has also been distracted from the bigger picture...
[End\]];W[hn]C[don't want to be chased upwards...but was n16 the move here?

[DP\]
N16 is without doubt a big move.  But you are right to concentrate on the urgent stuff first and getting connected there is vital. Good decision
[End\]];B[md]
(;W[nb]C[[DP\]
I don't understand this - N17 is quite playable and the double hane can be handled - see variation from previous move
[End\]];B[mc];W[fk]C[[DP\]
Black should come back and play N18 in sente now
[End\]]
(;B[kl];W[mb];B[kc];W[jk]C[black middle looking so big.

[DP\]
Ever since the top left joseki really :-)  but Black is not defending it well so you get to eat up most of it.  There's not really much more to comment on from here on in.  Black's main mistake is to defend it with contact moves all the way through rather than dropping back a line to secure the territory.  Consequently you are able to make shape and continue invading
[End\]];B[kj];W[kk];B[lk];W[jj];B[ji];W[pj]C[[DP\]
I don't like this - that area is already reduced - see what happens if Black ignores it
