Hi, i am beginner in Go, and i would like some tips.

In this game, I found that I chose the josekis badly, and he catch the center, then, it was difficult to take his territory.



[Rich\] Hi there, I'll go through with comments and summarise at the end.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[po];W[dj];B[jp];W[ip]
(;B[qj]C[[R\] - If someone plays a ston just next to a single stone of yours, you should almost *always* respond by either extending or playing hane. even if you just both keep extending upwards, you are on the centre line here so have the advantage.]
;W[fq];B[mp]C[[R\] you don't need to play here, it is too close to all your other stones and doesn't do anything definite. K10 or K16 are much bigger and spread out your influence much more. And they will have a big effect on the centre.]
;W[jd]C[I find that I must have played for here before.];B[ce]
;W[cd];B[de];W[cg]
(;B[fd]C[[R\] - see variation];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[bd];W[bc]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[ae]C[[R\] - Your group is in the middle of white's influence, so it's important to get it safe, even if it means giving up a few stones.

You don't need to protect B16; it's only a few points difference whether you do or not. A move around D or E13 would do a lot more to settle your group.]
;W[bf]C[[R\] - Again, ignore this and expand your group toward the centre - you'll take points from him and settle your group at the same time.]
;B[be];W[nd];B[oc];W[nc];B[od];W[hd]C[now, he have a great influence in center, and i have to fight to save my group, what it made with he gained more influence and was with a good moyo in left side.

[R\] - You have to settle your weak groups, especially when they're in  your opponent's influence. Even if you live, you will probably be surrounded in and your stones will not do anything for the rest of the game, all for a couple of points.]
;B[gf];W[if];B[he];W[ie];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[ic];B[ac];W[ab]
;B[fb];W[da];B[ad];W[ba];B[gh];W[gj];B[eg];W[ii];B[ef]C[[R\] - Now almost the whole lower left is his, compared to a few points for you.]
;W[jl];B[cq]C[now, I was trying to diminish the territory of it, but I think that this was not the best play.

[R\] - It's not bad if you know what to do with it! If you're playing a move like this, remember two things: firstly, work out your opponent's likely answer and a way to deal with it, and secondly, be prepared to give up stones to settle your group.]
;W[dq];B[dp];W[do];B[bp];W[co];B[dr];W[ep];B[br];W[bo]C[the two following plays, had been exactly necessary for make life?]
;B[ap];W[er];B[ds];W[ng];B[pg]C[I think that I must have played in O9 before it, instead of defending my territory.

[R\] - Defnding territory on the fourth line is nearly always big. It's hard to say which is better.]
;W[nk];B[lh]C[now I had to try some thing to diminish her moyo, but this play is realy the best?? I thought that I could try to connect of a side if he cut me in the other.

[R\] - My advice here is - try to read it out before you play. I don't think this stone should survive; I would have looked to cut off O9 if possible, I think. 

Also, a play around J/K5, or maybe just K3, has been important since the beginning of the game!]
;W[ni];B[ih];W[kg]C[[R\] - White should play K12 here.];B[kh]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[jg];B[hi];W[ij];B[hj]C[I used to advantage myself of the previous plays, to invade the left side of the territory of it.

[R\] - This is good play, taking advantage of white's mistake keeps you in the game!]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[jj];B[gk];W[hl];B[fj]C[give atari here, is a good idea?

[R\] - In this case, yes.  It completely captures the stone and your group now has a chance to get further into white's territory.]
;W[fk];B[gi];W[gl];B[ek];W[fl];B[ej];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[em]
;W[dm];B[ch]C[I tried to kill this two stones,, but for some reason I did not obtain

[R\] - As far as I can see, they are connected and can't be cut off. You did a good job reducing the territory here, though.]
;W[dh];B[bh];W[dg];B[di];W[ci];B[bi];W[ei];B[bg];W[cf];B[af]
;W[bj];B[ao];W[am];B[an];W[bm];B[bn]C[[R\] - This is a small move, there are many more points to be gained in the lower right.]
;W[cn];B[gn]C[if it placed here, it would have good moyo

[R\] - but I think if he plays better, white can capture this. I might be wrong, it's a difficult fight and a good idea. But it's not a big moyo here, you can make bigger with your lower-right framework.

The knight's move (E7-G6) is good for attacking, but it can be cut, so it's not always so good for reducing. F6 or J5 would be better, I think.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[fm];B[hp];W[hq];B[iq];W[io];B[gq];W[hr];B[gr]

(;W[ir]C[[R\] - see variation];B[jq];W[jr];B[kr];W[kq];B[kp]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[mq];B[js];W[lp];B[is];W[lo];B[np];W[nq];B[oq]
;W[ko];B[hs];W[en]C[[R\] - this is a tiny move, compared to something around R7-8]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[gj];W[fh];B[fg];W[di];B[fe]C[only guaranteeing my two eyes

[R\] - good play];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg];B[gg];W[mo]C[[R\] - again, white needs to play around R7-8]
;B[no];W[nn];B[jo];W[jn];B[in];W[im];B[ho];W[oo]C[[R\] - this is a bad atari. It makes you connect your stones (which is good for you), doesn't help him in any way, and you end up with initiative to play R7.]
;B[op];W[on];B[qm];W[ln]C[[R\] - for good shape, it should be played one line higher. P18 is much bigger.]
;B[ob]C[[R\] - you can play the hane at O18 here, but well done on getting the right area!]
;W[nb];B[ne];W[me];B[oe];W[mg]C[now, what you think of my yose?

[R\] - so far, it is much better than white's! This is how you won, making bigger moves than white in the endgame. It's a hard way to win.]
;B[na];W[ma];B[oa];W[mc]C[[R\] - M18 is better here];B[oh];W[nh]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[ok];W[oi];B[pi];W[og];B[ph];W[ol];B[pl]
(;W[om]C[[R\] - Good work! See variation];B[mr];W[nr];B[or]
;W[pk]C[[R\] - ah, white sees it. :)];B[pj];W[ql];B[qk];W[pm]
;B[rl];W[pn];B[qn];W[nf];B[of]
(;W[fo]C[[R\] - This is very small, only one point. E1 must be answered (see var), and O1 is worth a couple of points.]

[ha][ga][fa][ea][ca][aa]C[[R\] - You played a good endgame compared to white, well done - you can see how this can easily make 10 or 20 points difference. White can still make one point difference by playing at E1!

Having a weak group is bad - it doesn't just make a few points, it can lose points. Managing weak groups takes a lot of skill - you did well to break through at F10, otherwise you would probably have lost.

Three golden rules to remember with groups

- don't get surrounded, like the top-left group did. Always try to keep a way out, a path to the centre or along the side

- don't try and save every single stone. Giving up stones is necessary to get stronger.

- settle your weak groups as soon as you can, and NEVER have more than one weak group.]

(;W[es]C[[R\] - if black plays elsewhere...];B[ns];W[bs]C[[R\] - this threatens a snapback if white plays at C2, so black has to connect...]
;B[cr];W[ar]C[[R\] - this threatens a snapback at B3, so black has to connect...]
;B[bq];W[as]C[[R\] - and black is dead, as this becomes a bent four in the corner. So black MUST answer E1 at, for example, B1.]
))
(;W[pk]C[[R\] - white is better this way];B[pj];W[pm];B[ql]
;W[pn];B[qn]C[[R\] - since the cut at O8 doesn't work ( I don't think), white now has sente - or initiative - to play elsewhere. P2 I think.]
))
(;W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hs];W[kp]C[now white has a better position than in the game, and black still has to connect at E1 for his group to live.]
))
(;B[ec]C[[R\] - since white played C13 instead of F16, you can settle things more efficiently by playing here. Whatever happens, you should get a live group easily from here.]
))
(;B[jo];W[io];B[in]C[[R\] - This already looks better than letting white play K5]
