AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][pj][dj][jp][jd][jj]C[Hi, Brian. Hope my comments are useful. First off, some general stragegy notes in high-handicap games.

1) Make w live in a small space. Since you're getting the high handicap, you're unlikely to be able to read well enough to kill w's groups. So settle for making him live with small territory.

2) Attack, attack, attack. You have a *huge* advantage to start and w must work hard to overcome it. Don't let him off easy.

3) Connect to the center. Your biggest territory is in the middle. Play to minimize w's influence there and if you feel a group getting weak, run to the middle with it.

4) Break up w groups. There is an old go adage: If you have five groups, one of them is dead. Work to keep w's stones seperated.

Now, on with your game. :)];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[do]LB[fq:A]
[fp:B]C[BTP: Umm, yeah, I know, empty triangle = bad. I should have played  A or B right?

A or B would be standard plays, yes.];W[fn];B[fp];W[bj];B[cl]
C[Good instinct here. This move aims to split the w stones.]
;W[dk]
(;B[cj]C[With this move, however, you miss the opportunity to break up w's group. See the variation where you play one spot lower.]
;W[ck];B[bi];W[bl]C[See the nice base w has there now? No real eyes yet, but enough flexibility that he needn't worry about attack.]
;B[dg];W[ej];B[ei];W[fk];B[hj]C[Another good instinct. prevent w from gaining the center. Unfortunately, your group has too many flaws.]
;W[fi];B[eh]C[Now w has gained access to your center-top and his group is well settled.]
;W[qn]C[So he attacks elsewhere.];B[qo];W[pn];B[nq]C[BTP: I learned my lesson this time... didn't really help me though.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[qd]
(;B[pc]C[You can play in the 3-3 point here instead. See the variation.]
;W[qc];B[ql]C[Good move. w now lacks a base with this group and must run to the middle for eye space.]
;W[nn]
(;B[ol]C[With this follow-up, you miss the opportunity to expand your attack above as well. You give up sente, initiative, for a fairly small move. See how, in the variation, you can move against w's other group and still be able to come back and make this move.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[ri]
(;B[rn]C[Not a bad move but one that ends up losing sente again. Better to press the attack from the top of the group as I've done in the variation.]

;W[kl];B[kk];W[lk];B[ml];W[km];B[pk]LB[mi:A]C[BTP: I thought I had to do something to garauntee life for the middle right group. Was that
necessary?

Probably not, you can run to life effectively at A. Also, this move doesn't guarantee you life. You need a few more moves to make all your eyes. That makes this group a great target if a ko should come up.]
;W[po];B[pq]LB[qp:A]C[You need to defend A here, as you learned later. ;)]
;W[mi]C[w cuts off your avenue of escape, forcing you to play to live in that space. Notice how small that space is...probably only get you about 4 points. Of course if w kills you, he gets over 20, not counting dead stones.]

(;B[kd];W[ob];B[nf]C[BTP: Is there anyway to kill the N17 group? After the game, we couldn't come up with any. At
this move, I realized that my m16 group had no terretory, so I needed to get some eyes...

Not as it sits now. See the variation for how you could have killed it earlier.]
;W[pb];B[og];W[pg];B[oh]C[You've built up a good attack on w's middle stones here.]
;W[ji]C[And w knows it, tries to connect out.]
(;B[kh]C[And you let him go. :(

Notice that your stones on the 16 line are connected to your live group on the right. you needn't worry abou them. Look at the variation for how you might have continued the attack.]
;W[kj];B[mh]C[And you give up the attack a second time, handing w larger territory in the middle.l]

;W[er]LB[dr:A][cr:B]C[BTP: Again, should this stone be able to live?

I think not. By playing outside of it, however, you let w get access to the corner where it is easier to live.  Better to play A or B here. Either builds you a good base in the corner and pushes him out along the side to live.]

(;B[gr];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[ar];B[bs]LB[fr:A]
C[BTP: Again, after the game, I think we determined that A is better. The played stone
certainly didn't help any...

Indeed, w should play c1 and live...as it turns out, however, he gave you another chance you missed....]

(;W[cs];B[fr];W[fs]C[this is a w mistake....];B[in]LB[es:A]

unlikely...

Oh, yeah...at least one of these stones is dead. Let's look at some variations.]

;W[rh];B[qg];W[rg]C[So, in summary, neither of w's groups in the left corners should have lived. That's about 25 points of territory you're missing out on, plus any captured stones. Where you mostly went wrong, however, was in letting w dominate the center. His big presence there squeezes your top groups down to only 14 points of territory.

You demonstrated some good instincts, though, so keep at it.]
