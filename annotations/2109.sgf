C[Hallo,
I'd like to comment this game where I suffered a totally desaster.
I have the impression that I lost this game already in the first 50 stones.
I have added some comentary for which ones I guess were the "loosing moves". I' m sure?
Thank you in advance


Hi, I have commented your game.  In the fuseki a difficult 4-way running battle started, but black played a few moves away from the main battle.  Also late in this battle white cut black, but black just accepted that he was cut instead of fighting back (although black could have considered it a trade--ignoring the cut to finish the ko on the topside).

Generally I think you need to focus on where the weak/strong groups on the board are, and how to play based on that.

There were also a few cases where black could have killed white's groups, and one case in the very end where black didn't connect a large group of stones in the endgame.
