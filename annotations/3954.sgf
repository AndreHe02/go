C[Hello, my name is Arnaud Boucherie. I play as 8k on KGS (account ExplO) so I might make mistakes. I'll star each comment with AB.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[gc]C[AB: The lower left corner is yours so you can try something more ambitious, such as E16, F16 (which develops the D17 stone more), or a pincer (which puts more pressure on the C15 stone).]
;B[cc]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I'm white he's black];W[cb];B[bc]
;W[cj]C[Starstreak [21k\]: i dont think ive made any large errors up to this point, but was the C10 move the best extension or no?

AB: You should play D16 first. If black plays it he makes good shape and the D17 groupe would be really weak.]

(;B[ch]C[AB: Black should consider D16 first.];W[jq];B[cn]C[Starstreak [21k\]: My opponent liked to fight alot during the fuseki]
;W[cm]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I think he was trying to pincer C10 but it backfired on him

AB: The idea is correct but C8 is probably better here. Attaching his stone will make it stronger. You also have stones in the area so you can fight.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[dn];B[bn]C[Starstreak [21k\]: Right now the group looks pretty dead. however, because of a stupid error of mine later in the game the group ends up living

AB: I don't think you can kill the black group.]
(;W[bm]C[Starstreak [21k\]: By the group i mean the C4-C6 group]
;B[mq];W[jc]C[Starstreak [21k\]: Was K17 truly the best move?  Should i have done a knights approach to Q16?  I just feared another pincer and then being chased around the board in a little line while he makes all the territory he wants

AB: Hard to say beacause the D17 group is weak, but a black move around Q10 is big. You can still play D5, killing the C4 group and making the k3 stone more efficient.]
;B[mc];W[qj]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I think that R10 was a good move (it ended up winning me the game in the end) but I'm not sure

R10 is a really good move.];B[qg];W[qm];B[qn];W[rn];B[qo]
(;W[gq]C[AB: You have already have many stones around so this move is too territorial. Building the moyo with K5 is better.]
;B[lo];W[jo];B[pm];W[ql];B[ro];W[sn]C[AB: S7 and T8 are both better. Descending is correct only if it is the only move to ensure life for your group. Next black can play T5 in sente so you have the worst possible endgame there.]
;B[so];W[rm]C[Starstreak [21k\]: Were my responses to his moves in my S6 group ok?
Starstreak [21k\]: the group did live, but my opponent was a 22k (I therefore had no komi)
Starstreak [21k\]: against a better player I fear that a move at T8 might have cut my life short

AB: you can run out easily so your group can't die if you take care of it.]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[pi];B[qh];W[rk]C[Starstreak [21k\]: S9 guaranteed life and influence into the center]
;B[mf];W[fj]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I have been told by other good players (10k+) that my 2 primary weaknesses are inability to keep and use sente to its fullest (such as guiding the shapes that my opponent and I create) and lifedeath
Starstreak [21k\]: F10 was an attempt to overcome that weakness.  I wanted to create a giant territory on the bottom left (to me it looked like a good idea)
Starstreak [21k\]: If he had simply responded to my moves and blocked, my territory would be greater


AB: I can't really say about sente. I agree about life and death, you made several wrong statement in this game about the status of groups.
Back to this game, F10 is a good move.];B[ph];W[pj];B[fh];W[hj]
;B[hh];W[jj];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[jh]C[Starstreak [21k\]: which is exactly what I did
Starstreak [21k\]: I have gotten a bit better at determining what moves my opponent plays are Gote and what aren't so i try to take advantage of having sente with L12, a decent reduction i think

AB: K12 is useless, the H10 is already strong and there is no territory around F14. B18 is a large endgame move, helping your upper group at he same time. L7, enlarging your territory and aiming at reducing the territory around O5 is another possibility.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[if];W[lg];B[mg];W[lf];B[dd];W[ec];B[ed];W[ge]
;B[fe];W[fd]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I'm just reducing his territory and expanding my own here.   i think i did an ok job of it, but i don't know

AB: If you had played D16 instead of K12 and K13 there would habe been no black territory.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[gg];W[me];B[ne];W[le];B[md];W[mh];B[nh];W[mi]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[lh];W[li];B[kc]C[Starstreak [21k\]: This move i planned about 5-6 moves in advance, and while it's small, I take alot of pride in it :)]
;W[ng]C[Starstreak [21k\]: This move i mean

AB: It's quite big :)];B[nf];W[oh]C[Starstreak [21k\]: obviously a halfdecent player would never be caught in something like this but at my level anything can happen]
;B[og];W[nh]C[AB: This is small and gote.];B[pf];W[kb];B[lb]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[ka];B[la];W[jb];B[mk];W[pl];B[om]C[AB: The Q8 P7 exchange is only helping black.]
;W[jm]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I try to further enclose my area from his.  With some backthinking i now think that perhaps i should have soon invaded his upper right at the 3-3 point

AB: Unless black makes a mistake you can't live in the upper right.]
;B[lm];W[kl]C[AB: This is small, B18, B11 and M2 are larger.]
;B[ll];W[ol];B[nl];W[qq]C[AB: This can't work];B[pq];W[pr]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I do make the invasion at the bottom right successfully.  if i were playing you would you have responded differntly than my opponent and been able to kill my group?

AB: The first moves your opponent played were right. The problem is that later he played elsewhere thinking you were alive while you were still dead.]
;B[or];W[qs]C[AB: Actually you die in gote, I show why later.]
;B[kk];W[jk];B[km];W[jl];B[kj];W[ki];B[lj];W[rr]

;B[ie];W[id];B[di];W[dj];B[bi];W[nk]C[AB: 1 point in gote, you can't cut.]
;B[mm];W[bj];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[bl];B[ej];W[ek];B[ei];W[fk]
;B[bb]C[Starstreak [21k\]: This is all just standard endgame stuff, i might have lost myself a point or two but i dont think i made any gigantic errors

AB: B18 has been the biggest move for quite a while. In the end you won by only half a point so the importance of B18 can't be denied.]
;W[da];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[qp]C[AB: Black S3 would still kill while White S3 instead of r4 would give life.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[os];W[ps]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I confirm life for the bottom left
Starstreak [21k\]: *bottom right

AB: see previous comments];B[si];W[rj];B[sj];W[sk];B[sh];W[je]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[ii];W[ih];B[hg];W[ji]C[AB: H11 instead gains 4 or 5 points.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[ij];W[ik];B[hk]C[Starstreak [21k\]: Yea yae this was stupid
Starstreak [21k\]: plain stupid on my part
Starstreak [21k\]: i know
Starstreak [21k\]: as soon as i played the move i knew

AB: I don't understand you here. You can connect at G10 and nothing happens.]
;W[hl];B[gj];W[gk];B[hj];W[gn]C[AB: B3 is better to remove the aji.]
;B[fi]C[Starstreak [21k\]: I lost a stone and gave my opponent 2 points of territory...what an amazing move on my part lol
Starstreak [21k\]: i was simply thinking my opponent was going to try a reckless invasion and try to connect to his side group. it had a slim to zero chance of living but at my level i wasnt below giving up 1 point to make that chance of life for him 0

AB: I understand your point of view but it's not the proper way to improve. You should try to play the move that you think are correct, not the moves you are comfortable with.]
;W[kn];B[bq]C[Starstreak [21k\]: and THIS
Starstreak [21k\]: is where i make my final stupid error
Starstreak [21k\]: i CANT BELIEVE I LET THIS GROUP LIVE
Starstreak [21k\]: like i said, lifedeath really is a weakness..
Starstreak [21k\]: i should have play B3 far before this when my opponent did a Gote to ensure this grroups death
Starstreak [21k\]: i mean my moves around M15 were worth a few points, but this group living cost me like 8

AB: I don't know how you count but black living here costs you like 25 points.]
;W[cr];B[br];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[cs];W[ds]C[AB: No ! Black cuts at C2 now.]

(;B[bs];W[dr];B[ar];W[an];B[ap];W[am]C[AB: A pass move.];B[ln]
C[Starstreak [21k\]: my bad 13 points
Starstreak [21k\]: so angry with myself over that]
(;W[db]C[Starstreak [21k\]: As a small move, should i have done C19 rather than D18? i was scared of my opponent playing E18 and then getting into a messy situation

AB: See the variation.];B[ba];W[ci];B[bg];W[ld]C[AB: You can't cut, so M16 is a pass move.]
;B[od];W[sq];B[qc]C[Starstreak [21k\]: yea i know
Starstreak [21k\]: what was i thinking.  THER WAS STILL A 3-3 CORNER TO TAKE
Starstreak [21k\]: at move 201!!
Starstreak [21k\]: and i completely miss it

AB: As I said previously there is no way for you to live here. Black gives you a point.]
;W[sp];B[oo]C[AB: No need to protect, if black doesn't protect you lose by half a point. You were lucky black is not confident.]

C[Starstreak [21k\]: wow
Starstreak [21k\]: gg
diomedes [23k\]: close
diomedes [23k\]: :)
Starstreak [21k\]: o yea

Starstreak [21k\]: and this,,,
Starstreak [21k\]: i mean WOW
Starstreak [21k\]: talk about close
Starstreak [21k\]: i had forgotten i had no komi so i thought it was in the bag in the endgame
Starstreak [21k\]: but sheesh
Starstreak [21k\]: if this were a real game (meaning Komi=0 and not 0.5) this game would have been declared Jigo
Starstreak [21k\]: but in the end i get a win of .5 points
Starstreak [21k\]: i think my major screwups were:
Starstreak [21k\]: (tell me if i miss anything)
Starstreak [21k\]: 1.  I let the bottom left life
Starstreak [21k\]: 2. i didnt take the top right
Starstreak [21k\]: 3. i gave him free territory around H9
Starstreak [21k\]: 4.  I might have not been aggressive enough in the early midgame
Starstreak [21k\]: if there are any other major screwup please let me know, those were just the ones i saw
Starstreak [21k\]: Thanks for reviewing my game i really appreciate it :)


AB: During tournament, when a jigo happens, the rules usually give white the victory because he had to overcome the handicap.
Letting black live in the bottom left was a real mistake.
You should have tried to take the upper right corner when there where only 3 stones there. I think you are disapointed because you wanted to invade there in the end but it should not work.
You misread around H9 but I don't think it was a major mistake.
You were not aggressive during this game, but your right group and you top group were not so strong so it would have been risky to make random invasions.
Overall you seems to have a plan when you play. I mean you try to balance your position and you don't follow black's moves all the time. This is a good thing. What I think you should work on to improve is your reading. You can find life & death problems for free at goproblems.com It will help find estimate the status of each group (is the group weak or strong?) and find the weakness in shapes to invade or attack.]
