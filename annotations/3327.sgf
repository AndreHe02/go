AB[pd][dp]C[White: Cathound (me, Kalle Timperi)
Black: goggol

KKMD: The game is very soon irreversibly lost for white, so there is not much to comment.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[dc];W[ed];B[cf];W[id];B[mc];W[qi];B[qd]
;W[qf]C[Here I thought that it is beneficial to play in front of black's shimari and reduce his potential territory. When analysing the position I realized that for example K4 is bigger than R14. Is K4 or K3 the best move or is there something better?

KKMD: I'm not sure about this one, maybe you should ask a stronger (dan) player. I feel that black R16 is a slow move you don't need to answer. There are indeed still big points to be taken, the most obvious being K4/K3. No move seems obviously bigger to me, though certainly there are other possibilities, like probably F3. Again,  you should ask a stronger player for details.]
;B[jc];W[ic];B[di];W[fq];B[cq]C[KKMD: Certainly an unusual move...]
;W[cn]LB[jq:A]C[I guess the double-kakari is a bad mistake here. It ensures that white gets two more weak groups and black can increase his influence.

KKMD: Indeed, a simple extension at K3, for example, seems wiser.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[gq];B[dl];W[cl]C[KKMD: Contact moves are usually good ideas in order to settle quickly in enemy field.]
;B[ck]
(;W[cm]LB[bk:A]C[KKMD: Too heavy. In this kind of situation, A is a usual technique (see variation).]
;B[dm];W[bp]LB[bk:A]C[White should first force with A.];B[bk]
;W[bl];B[bq];W[dn];B[en];W[cp]LB[bo:A];B[jp]LB[bo:A]C[KKMD: Black is nice. He could have killed you, or at least tried hard, with A for instance.]
;W[ho];B[nq];W[dq];B[eq];W[do];B[dr]C[I didn't even realize how much ahead black was at this point. My main concern now was to make sure the white group at G3 doesn't die.

KKMD: Indeed the game is as good as won for black.];W[gn]C[KKMD: Bold...]

(;B[eo]LB[bo:A]C[KKMD: I think black could have killed you with A (see variations).]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[bj];W[fm]C[This move was designed to threaten to cut at E7 and I was hoping to kill the black group in the upcoming sequence. Black didn't take the threat seriously.]

(;B[qn]C[KKMD: Again, black could have killed your group (see variations).]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[oq];B[np]C[KKMD: This is terrible. Letting your corner being surrounded like that is the worst mistake you can make in such a position.]
;W[ql];B[oo];W[rn]C[My idea was that if I get to connect my stones on this side, they are strong enough to protect the corner, which was clearly bad judgment from my side. The formation is very loose.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og]C[At this point I realized, that I had to get a lot of territory in the center if I was going to stand any chance against black. My following moves are my attempt to make territory in the center.

KKMD: Black is thicker than you all around the board, you cannot expect to make much territory in the center.
You still have the weak group H5 to care about !];B[nf];W[jd]
;B[kc];W[dd];B[cc]C[KKMD: The last three moves you played are terrible. They fix the shape, killing all possible aji in black's positions. You should play like that only when you're ahead. It actually seems like you're helping black...]
;W[ng];B[ef]C[Now I thought it was time to cut black and threaten to kill it. In retrospect we see that the idea was a bit optimistic and any territorial move is bigger at this point.]
;W[em];B[jn];W[nl]C[KKMD: Hey, did you forget about your weak group ?]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nm];W[nk];B[lf]C[It's easy for black to make territory in the top.]
;W[lh];B[fk]C[Now I saw that the white group around G6 was anything but secure and I initiated a protective maneuver.

KKMD: But F8 could have been a more useful forcing move.];W[el]
C[This forcing move was probably completely useless. Well, if we suppose the white group lives, at least it takes away one point of territory from black.]
;B[dk];W[gl];B[gk];W[io];B[jo];W[hm];B[iq];W[il];B[gf];W[gd]
LB[gb:A][gc:B]C[I guess the sequence w-F15, b-F14, w-G15 might be better for white.

KKMD: Now black can invade at A. Your sequence is no better to prevent that. This is difficult. Maybe you should just have played B.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[op];B[or];W[nr]C[I didn't see the possibility of capturing the stones at Q4 until it was already too late.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[po];W[ro];B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[sm];B[qe];W[rg]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[re]C[KKMD: Too small !];W[om]C[I thought once again that I must get territory in the center or I'm finished, which I already was, more or less...]
;B[pm];W[mm]C[KKMD: You shouldn't expect black to answer that. This threat is way too small at this stage of the game. (not counting, of course, the fact that your left group is still not alive)]
;B[on];W[kl];B[mn];W[lm];B[ln];W[km]C[Instead of this I guess J10 or J12 would have been better. This is no threat.

KKMD: Of course. Obviously black doesn't care, the game has been long won.]
;B[kn];W[aq]C[I decided to check if I can kill black.];B[br]
;W[ar];B[er];W[fr];B[bs];W[cs];B[as];W[ap];B[ep];W[bo]C[This wasn't necessary.]
;B[es]C[Neither was this.];W[mg]C[This is small.];B[hk];W[ik]
;B[hh];W[jh];B[ii];W[ji];B[ij];W[jj];B[hl]C[I completely missed the point of this black move.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[ig];B[im];W[in];B[jm];W[go];B[hr]C[At this point I resigned.

I think I didn't play at my level in this game, but I'd like to get it reviewed anyway, and I'm especially interested to hear comments about my reasoning along the game. Secondly, at this case I'm perhaps more interested in what I did right than what I did wrong, because I can identify many of my mistakes myself. Of course there are mistakes I haven't noticed, and I'm very interested in hearing about them, too.]
