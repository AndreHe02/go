C[I am W.  The game was played on dragon, so I had unlimited thinking time.  It was against a team 1d & 2k.

I felt really behind until the middle game, then came back.]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[dd];W[pq];B[po]C[This move feels a little funny to me.  I'd play P16 to work with D16 instead.  But this can't be too bad.]
;W[pl];B[qq]C[W: i don't know how to deal with this

It is a mistake for black, punish it as in the variation.]
(;W[qp]C[This looks like an overplay.];B[pp];W[qo];B[oq];W[pr]
C[W: maybe just give them up?

Black would get territory and thickness by capturing the two stones.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[qn];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[pn]C[W: ouch.  So now q8 looks bad

This exchange is very bad for white, yes.  Not just Q8, but black's thickness is worth a lot more than white's territory in the corner even without Q8 on the board.]
;W[cj]C[W: I didn't want to let him get this

Yes, this helps reduce his thickness a bit.  I'd play even closer to the corner, C6 or maybe even F3, to try to make black play too close to the thickness.]
;B[jp]C[Black plays too close to the thickness anyway!  Black should play around C8 and then F4 in my opinion.]
;W[fc]C[This feels like you are hurting your own C10 stone.  Too greedy!  First support C10 by playing C7 or C6, then you can play here.]
;B[ec]C[Bad for black, giving strength to the F17 stone.];W[fd]

(;B[df]C[Also bad for black, giving C10 room to move around.]
;W[jd]C[W: I'm happy with this.  My low vs his high on the left.

yes, black D14 was a mistake.];B[cl];W[ch];B[cg]C[Black's corner shape here is very bad.  If C14 earlier, then E14 now would be just right.]
;W[dh];B[ff]C[This fails to hurt white's strong stones at the top.  Black has given white too much.]
;W[ee]C[White is making an overplay here, hurting the left side stones.]
;B[ef]C[The E15-E14 exchange helps black attack white.];W[ce]
;B[de]
(;W[bg]C[W: this should be c14, right?  Then the middle left group is alive and B is sort of floating.  Of course the whole E15 thing feel wrong anyway...

I don't think C14 works (see variation).];B[cf];W[bf];B[be]
;W[fq]C[W: creating another weak group...

Black looks like getting a severe attack at B11 later, plus still has threats to enclose you.  So this looks bad for white.  F3 is definitely an overplay.  ow about P17 instead, if you want territory?  Or E10, for defense?  Something that helps give this group some life.]
;B[dq];W[iq]C[This is almost always bad shape.  Black is happy to play K3 and get strong.  H3 is better shape.  Or in this case, just run!!!]
;B[jq];W[ip]C[W: feels really wrong.  pushing the cart from behind...  but what else can I do?  k2?

J3 was already the mistake: should have been H3, or H4, or F5 ...  After J3-K3 exchange, there's nothing good to do.]
;B[ir]C[Black helps white here, again.];W[hr];B[jr];W[fn]C[Now white's group is in pretty good condition.]
;B[fp]C[Overplay.  White can give up F6 anyway.];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[go];B[gn];W[eq]C[W: this turned out to be so bad, right?

E3 seems bad, helps black. Just give up F6.  Reduce black's territory to the right: come out at J6, for example, threatening to capture G6.]
;B[dn]C[W: ouch.  i think i need to save f6 to have a chance

Let black take F6, and use its sacrifice to get into the M6 area and reduce that thickness even more.]
;W[io];B[gm]C[Is this really so big?  Black could consider P17 or R13 area instead.]
;W[od]C[White J5 is a very powerful stone.  Now black can't easily enclose.  So the center won't get too black, probably.  White has gained a lot, as long as that left side group stays alive.]
;B[qi];W[qg]C[How about playing on top at P11 instead, helping your weak Q8 stone get out, maybe making it easier to reduce black's bottom area?]
;B[oi]C[Now Q8 looks pretty sad and this black area looks potentially pretty big.]
;W[nl]C[W: 3 weak groups now

But at least here black has R11 weak stones that you can maybe do something against.]
;B[om]C[Black should not play this way: black is strong here already!  Black is coming from the wrong side.]
;W[pj]C[This helps strengthen black's weak group.  Is it really worth it?]
;B[pi];W[rm];B[ol];W[ok]C[Black is giving you strength here.  Why?  White can play K6 so this bottom area is not so big anyway.]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[oj]C[W: that whole exchange seems good for me

Yes, black gained only a few points on the bottom, white gained strength for the group and some ability to attack the R11 black stones.  Black attacked in the wrong direction.  Attack TOWARD strength, not from strength.]
;B[ld]C[Overplay for black, now white gets a great chance to attack P11 stones.]
;W[ke];B[me];W[og];B[mg];W[ni]C[W: so happy about this

Yes, now you have black split in two instead of the other way around.]
;B[jc];W[id]C[W: too afraid?  the space on the left seemed too wide

Seems like you have to try J17 hane at least.];B[kc];W[ic]C[Well, if you J17 and black L17 then you J16, so same result but in a different order :)]
;B[nc];W[oc];B[of];W[ng];B[nf];W[pf]C[P11 stones are big!  Now white gets some territory and no more weak group there.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[lf];B[mf];W[li];B[lg];W[kg];B[ob];W[nd]
;B[mc];W[pb];B[kh];W[lh];B[na];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[mb];W[bd]
;B[cd];W[ae];B[bc]C[W: now i have a chance to do something in the UL corner, right?

Not much chance.  Black is out into the center...];W[dl];B[dk]
;W[en];B[eo];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[el];W[fm];B[jl];W[kn]C[W: I figure I'm losing, might as well go for it

OK, but isn't K6 enough?];B[jo];W[jn]
(;B[im]C[Black should cut here. Or maybe not.  See variation.]
;W[in];B[er];W[lp];B[lr];W[lm];B[gk];W[fj];B[jg]C[W: I guess he's trying to kill the top]
;W[no];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq];B[mo];W[mr];B[lo];W[ko];B[mm]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[ii]C[W: this ended up not being that good

Reduce more gently: make sure you stay connected, don't jump in deep like this.  Especially with black so strong in the center.]
;B[hi];W[dj]C[W: because he might kill my e6 stones.  I should probably be worried about the top though.

The top is bigger and seems to have more eye space worries.  Also B9 is more sente and probably almost as big as your E6 stones anyway.]
;B[hh];W[he]C[W: I think I live.];B[ge];W[gd];B[hc];W[kf];B[ih]
C[W: I had missed this move.  K12 and L11 don't work for him and I thought I was ok.]
;W[jf];B[if];W[ie];B[kd];W[hf];B[ig];W[gf]C[W: maybe unnecessary]
;B[fe];W[gg]C[W: it would have been nice to get l11 in sometime.

L11 threatens to live, so you could play it any time he threatens to kill.]
;B[ki];W[fh];B[qb];W[pa]C[W: i figure i'll get a ko on the left so it'll be ok

Yeah, black can't play this, because the other group dies then.  He needs the O18 eye.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[rd];W[qe];B[sb];W[oa];B[la];W[nb];B[lj]C[W: I was worried about like O12 and squeeze, especially before his r18]
;W[nh];B[ob];W[sd];B[se];W[re];B[sc];W[ra];C[Result: W+Resign]
N[RESULT];B[nb]C[If black just lives with this group ... is it really time to resign?  There are still big points left (B9, S6, F2) and it seems close enough to be worth finishing the endgame.]

(;B[in];W[im];B[hn];W[il]C[Hm, maybe black shouldn't cut here.  This looks hard for black.]

(;W[cf]C[If C14 as you suggest...];B[bg];W[dg];B[cd]C[Isn't black ahead, 3 liberties to 2?]
))
(;B[cf]C[Black should play here.  Then white can't defned both F16 and C10.]
;W[jd];B[cl]C[Black has a fairly severe attack in this case.]
