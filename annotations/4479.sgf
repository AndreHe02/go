AB[pd][dp]C[JFR : This game turned into one big fight (which I think I could have won with a var. on move 174).

I have listed questions on moves.

Thank  you.];W[pp];B[dd];W[df];B[ee]LB[fd:a][fc:b]C[F: This is a little strange, normal on a or b.]
;W[cd]
(;B[hd]C[F: This is not good. White is coming into your corner, so you have to defend it. See variations]
;W[cc]C[F: Now white gets the corner and he can jump into your upper side.]
;B[cj]MA[dc]C[F: So you should defend at x];W[qf];B[nc];W[jc]
;B[hc]C[F: This would be good, if you had defended your corner. Now you only attack the white stone, while it could have been an attack+making profit on the upper left side.]
;W[je];B[hf];W[rd]
(;B[of]C[F: Defend the corner is better. This is not really threatening the K17 stones. See variation]
;W[pc]C[F: This is to greedy. Normal would be R17. See variation on nextt move]

(;B[oc]C[F: Too defensive. Variation];W[qc];B[jg]C[F: Good]
;W[mf];B[oh];W[ne];B[oe];W[mh]
(;B[ke]C[F: This doesn't seem to be the good point to attack. See variation.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[lc];B[kc];W[le];B[kf];W[kb];B[lb];W[mb];B[jb]
;W[la];B[ib]C[F: You gained something, but the problem is that white has become very strong and can attack your stones on the right.]
;W[ni]
(;B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[pg]C[F: Just connect gives better shape. Variation.];W[pj]
;B[qi];W[qj]
(;B[nh]C[F: This is only making white stronger];W[ng];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[oj];W[mi];B[ok];W[qh];B[ri];W[ph]C[JFR : What would have been the best way to avoid this cut?
F: See variations on previous moves.];B[rj];W[fq];B[dm]LB[dn:a]
C[F: This is too wide. Normal on a];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]TR[dm]C[F: But thanks to the white invasion, black X  is on the right spot now.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]
(;W[dc]C[F: Variation is better];B[ec];W[de];B[nq]C[F: This is more important than connecting on the upper side.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[pk]
(;W[qp]C[F: Not so good. See variation]
(;B[nn]C[F: Rather vague];W[np];B[mp];W[oq]C[F: Now white gets the whole corner]
;B[no];W[nr]
(;B[mq]C[F: Better take. See variation];W[mr];B[kj]C[F: I think it's better to defend your bottom side. Whites next move is extremely big.]
;W[kq];B[kp]C[JFR : too close?  Should white of played the hane at k4 here?
F: This move is OK]
(;W[jq];B[jp];W[ed];B[iq]C[JFR : Is this bigger than responding to the upper left?

F: Yes! You're strong on the upper side, so whites move isn't so big.]
;W[ip]C[F: Seems like overplay]

C[JFR : was this needed?  It seemed so at the time, but I could have used an extra move for fighting.

F: This move and a move on X are miai for the life of your group so it's not really needed, but big]

(;W[pr]C[JFR : This move not needed for white?

F: No.];B[jl];W[il];B[hk]C[F: Good, you're very strong on all sides in the centre, so you can go for the kill.]
