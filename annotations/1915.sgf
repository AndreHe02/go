C[i am black, i am black, my opponent is igc 16k. i am 18k in real life.

If w had not made the endgame mistake, it would be a very close game. You ask very good questions. If you had more clearly understood the issues in the upperleft and lowerright, you could have won by a big margin. A 3-3 point invasion is always possible against an isolated 4-4 point stone. The invader doesn't get a big life, but he takes a lot of territory that the other player may have been expecting. Usually other opportunities against the 4-4 stone are also present. There are several good 3-3 and 4-4 point opening books if you want to read about this situation. Good luck in your future play.]

C[is 10 an unresonable move? but it is alive at last. if so, what is wrong with my moves.

It is probably not unreasonable, but I probably would not pick the narrowest place for an invasion and then try to make life there at this point in the game. As black, you should not feel that you failed if w gets life here. More comments after w gets his life.]

C[ 
w has life, but it is worth 2 or 3 points at the most. This is only a problem for b if he expected to be able to claim almost the whole bottom side for himself. That is unrealistic. b has some compensation. The area between the triangled stones and the corner is now closer to b territory than it was before. On the other side, b's group can extend into the corner or run into the center. b needs to be aware of the cutting point at A.]

[dq:B]C[I wonder if this move correct as 8 is in the middle.my land will be lesser than white if we keep on jumping vertically to the end . where should i put then?

If both sides could keep their halves, b would be a little worse off at the top, but because his stones are a little closer togther, it is a little easier for him to defend against invasion. Also b's triangle stones take away some of w's half already. However, I am even more concerned about the cutting point at A now that w has defended his corner with B.]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[qg];B[qe]C[will it be better if i place 35 at R11

Good question, I honestly don't know. They are more or less miai points (of equal value)]

I don't think so, see alternate.];B[oc];W[pe];B[qc];W[qf];B[re]
LB[qi:A][qj:B]C[
At this point, I think A or B is bigger. You get to both have the upper right corner and protect your lower right while continuing to threaten the w groups life.]

A probably better to prevent w atari with cut];W[nj];B[mi];W[nk]

(;B[pl]TR[mh][mi][ni][lh][ph][pi][pj][oj]C[will it be better to place 65 at 0 14?

It might be interesting to find out. w will want to struggle to make life or kill one of b's triangle groups. See alternate for one possible line.]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[nf]C[white is alive >_< !!!!!

Yes but looking back at 34, w had every right to life since you could not play on both sides of his invading stone at the same time. The fact that he had to struggle so for it suggests something wrong with his play.]
;B[lk]TR[lh][mh][mi][ni]CR[nj][nk]C[i think 69 is a bad move, isn't it?

Not at all! This move protects your triangle stones by capturing w's circle stones and aims into the center.]

(;W[cl]LB[if:A][ig:B]C[this is a waste too. am i right?

w has bigger moves like A or B, but a b move at the game point could be effective. See alternate.]
;B[fm]LB[go:A]C[i doubt whether 71 should be place here. what do you think?

I don't know for sure. If it works, it is a bold move that protects the cutting point at A, while holding w lower on the left and expanding b's center influence. It is a little far from the cutting point so there is some concern.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[fo];B[eo]
(;W[kn]C[i think 76 is a wrong move. it should be  j6(white) h6(black) then L6(white). am i correct? is there any chance that white will alive after that?

I play this out in the alternate. It doesn't seem to work for w. Actually the game move has some potential.]
;B[km];W[in];B[lo];W[hn];B[jo]
(;W[hm]C[
I like the alternate better, but don't know for sure if w can escape.]

(;B[gm]TR[fr][fq][ep][eo][gp]C[83 should be G8 right?

Hmmm... At first I didn't think so, but maybe you are right (See alternate)]
;W[hl];B[fk];W[hj];B[ji]LB[fi:A]C[sould i attack white from this side(right side) right away in the begining in  83?

No, I don't think so. There is benefit in having 2 routes into his territory. Your stones on the left are poised to poke out into his claimed sphere of influence. In fact, A is probably better than the game move.]
;W[fi];B[hi]LB[hh:A][cc:B][fc:C][cf:D]C[
I like A better than this contact move. B is also going to have think about the best time and place for an invasion while he can still make one. Like at the 3-3 point, B or maybe C or D]
;W[gj];B[gh]C[
This is too small.];W[fj]LB[fh:A]C[
This is not needed. A is better];B[fh]C[
Good];W[en];B[fn];W[ek];B[fl]C[
Too small. Invade!];W[er]C[is this a waste move too?

Yes, endgame move. Contest is all in UpperLeft.]
(;B[dg]LB[fc:A]C[
Maybe not the best point. I like A See alternate.];W[fc]C[is 100 a waste move?

No, b would havve been able to play here very effectively.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[ci];W[cj];B[di]LB[bi:A]C[
A better];W[qq]C[ah...... should i protect this corner by 3q or other move ealier? if yes , when?

Yes and no. The battle in the upperleft was bigger, but you have played some smaller moves, most recently 105]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or]
(;B[pr]LB[qh:A]TR[nr][mr]C[i wonder is this a correct move.

It doesn't turn out too bad by itself.  See alternate for another possiblity. What you really need is to play A at the earliest opportunity even if you lose a couple more points in the triangle area. You just want to play here enough to confine w to the corner.]
;W[qr];B[nr];W[ps];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[oo];W[rj]C[can this 120 be caught? if yes, how?

See alternate.]

good];W[he];B[if];W[lb];B[mb]C[will it be better to play on L17 before this move?

No, This move wouldn't be sente then.];W[kb]C[will it be better to play on M17 or L17 (more land)]
;B[jk]C[should this be on j9 or it is simplly a waste move?

j9 is better, it takes more territory];W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[kj]
;W[ei]LB[je:A][ef:B][bi:C]C[this is another waste move, isn't it?

Not totally but A-C are bigger.];B[ik];W[hk];B[ff]LB[bj:A][ie:B]
C[i think 159 is no good since there is no harm if black play on F15 afterward. am i right?

This is worth a point or 2, but A or B are better. Consider b F15 vs w F15. If b F15 w has to play F16 and ultimately E16, loses 2 points of his territory.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[eh];B[eg];W[dh];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[fs]
C[can black 169 kill the white group on the right if white dont respond ?

No, see alternate.]
(;W[gq]LB[gs:A]C[
This is the wrong move. b can ignore this since it is a snap back. w should play A.]

Well they are good moves if they provoke w to make a mistake. But yes, w's 206 was a mistake.
I play a reasonable alternate from 206 where w wins by 1 point so it was very close.]
