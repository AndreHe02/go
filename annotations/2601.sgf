C[Dear Reviewer,

this is a game I just played on KGS. Throughout the game, I was quite happy with it, until I made a stupid mistake at move 242. Later, I found out, that I didn't have an advantage, but was behind. And moreover, I had been falling behind quite a while ago. So I probably would have lost the game anyway, mistake or not.

My inability to judge the game roughly correct is a hindrance. And also, that I play what I feel to be good moves and fall behind while doing it makes me wonder... something seems to be wrong with my Go.

Maybe you can help me find out.

Thank you in advance.

Christian Luehrs


Hi
My name is Yannick, I'm currently 5k on KGS. I hope this review will be of any help.]
;B[dd]C[It is considered good manner to start in the upper right corner, but you probably know this already.]
;W[pp];B[dp];W[pd];B[nq];W[pn];B[kp];W[cj]C[I like this move, to prevent him from playing there.

Yes it prevents the game from being moyo-oriented. It is a good choice if you're not comfortable with such games.]
;B[cg];W[cn];B[co];W[dn]C[I was happy that he forced me to play in a way that fitted the situation well, I think. Now the extension c10 is exactly right.

You're right, C5 is not a very good move.];B[gp]C[Moreover the G4 extension is slack, it's better at F4. Later W can aim at E4.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[This pincer is not consistent with the large knight move, wich aims at securing the corner territory. The pincer urges W to invade the corner (see variation).]

(;W[fe]C[It is not recommended to jump with this pincer.Indeed B can easily cut off the base of the two W stones, as shown in the variation.]

(;B[kc];W[mc];B[qf];W[qh]C[Same remark as before. B could also stabilize his stone by attaching at R16 (cf. var)]

;B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[ol];B[ql];W[pj]C[I should probably have connected at p9? Would have been better for my outside influence.

Yes I agree];B[ok];W[oj];B[nk];W[nl];B[nj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rh]
;B[sj]C[Now he lives on the side anyway and his group o9 is like a wedge.

Actually I don't think B's group is alive (see var). 
Even if it's not the case, W should have no worries about the O9 group since both W groups are quite strong.]

(;W[rn];B[rk]C[B plays the vital point. But it's OK since B lives with 3 points of territory while leaving two groups very weak (O9 and R14)]
;W[of]C[The R14 stone is captured];B[ni];W[dc];B[cc];W[cf]C[I am not very good at invading yet...

It was better to invade at the san-san.];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[bg]
LB[bh:A]C[B should play the double hane at a]
(;B[bf];W[ch];B[be];W[dg]TR[dc][fc][fe]C[I thought the ponnuki would be a good thing.

ok but B stones are connected and the 3 W marked stones are still weak.]

(;B[ed]C[This is bad shape. B could capture the D17 W stone thanks to the infamous 'stone-tower' tesuji (see var).]
;W[ec];B[cd];W[cg]C[I should have connected at f16 and let him capture to recapture immediately, I guess.

Yes];B[fd];W[bc];B[bb];W[gd];B[gc];W[af];B[bd]C[Too much profit for him and not enough for me.

Yes, beside connecting at F16, I don't see what you could have done to prevent this]
;W[le]C[To reduce his prospective territory and enlarge mine. Plus, to weaken his group o9.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[pi]C[I didn't understand this move at first but then...]
;W[oi];B[mg];W[mf];B[pg]C[... this follow-up move presented me with a tough choice - to connect at p13 or q12. After some thinking, I decided, that my smaller group r12 coule make it on its own.]
;W[og];B[ph];W[qg];B[pf];W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[qd]C[W can capture at R17 (see var)]

(;W[rd];B[sh];W[rg];B[qc];W[rc];B[oe]C[things got more complicated...]
;W[nf];B[od];W[pc];B[oc];W[qb];B[pe]C[This surprised me - I thought he would capture at q18 and I would have to concentrate to prevent him from making a second eye.

This is because his stones were in atari];W[pb];B[md];W[ld]
;B[lc]LB[mb:1][ob:2][nd:3]C[Play at 1, it makes miai of connecting at 2 or 3]

(;W[nd];B[nc];W[mb];B[ne];W[me];B[kd];W[ke];B[je]C[better at M13 than take the ko]
;W[nd];B[kf];W[md];B[lg]C[This is a bit disappointing for W since B has saved his O9 group]

(;W[ff]LB[ep:2][hp:3][ip:4][cq:1]C[This is really small.

You should invade B side at 1, 2, 3 or 4

C[This was probably too small. I should have played to reduce his center territory and enlarge my side territory at the same time.

It's ok you can still do it at this point];B[fh]C[bad for me]
;W[eh];B[fk]LB[km:1]C[Here you can break into the center territory at 1. I think it was the purpose of playing K6 anyway.]

(;W[el];B[fo];W[fn];B[km];W[ip]C[I played here to set something up in order to capture his stone at o3. And reducing his territory while doing so seemded nice.

Where should I concentrate to improve? I am rereading Otake's "Opening Theory Made Easy" right now, because I lately started to feel uneasy about my opening play again. I abandoned my plan to concentrate on fighting skills for now. I had started to read "Tesuji" and "Attack and Defense" from the Elementary Go Series.

But maybe I am looking in the wrong direction - so I appreciate suggestions from you.

Thanks again.

Christian

 "Opening Theory Made Easy" is a very good book, I enjoy reading it a lot. I think maybe the problem in this game is that W let B map out a moyo (in the left bottom corner). It is not a problem by itself but this game was what I would call "small-scale", i.e. with a lot of weak groups, with a lot of fighting. Usually this kind of games ends up with little territory actually made. B had loosely connected stones at the bottom, so W should have tried to seperate them when all his groups were settled. The aim is of course not to try to kill anything but rather to split the B corner and side. This is for the strategy comments. Beside this, I recommend to practice reading in order to avoid big losses like the one in the top left corner. I heard this game was reviewed by someone else, so I hope the reviews will be consistent and that you end up not too confused ;-)

Best regards
Yannick])
