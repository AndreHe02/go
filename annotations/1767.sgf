Hi Andy
This is the first game I comment on.
I'd love feedback on how you like or dislike it.];B[pd]C[yellowking [27k\]: Yea, thank you. ;-)
yellowking [27k\]: Good game, have fun!];W[qp];B[dp];W[cd]C[moutard [27k\]: u  too]

C[[Pedro\] A move on the 4-3 point needs another move on the same corner to stabilize it.]
;B[jd]C[[Pedro\] By playing two 4-3 points you allow black too much liberty while you stabilize your corners (I think).
I usually only play one 4-3 point with Black and may answer one 4-3 point by Black with one of my own.]
;W[oq];B[dj];W[ec]C[My thought was that getting a shimari is best followed by encroaching on black's corner stone.  However, I was pretty discouraged looking at the board at this point, it looked like he was staking out larger areas than I'm used to seeing.

[Pedro\] At this point you have two safe corners (with territory, but it's too soon to mind about territory) versus Black's moyo.
But I'd much rather have stopped Black from making the double-wing instead of making two safe corners for White.]

C[[Pedro\] the triangled space (where there was a Black stone) is not important.
It is not cutting your groups apart, it is not doing any work towards Black development -- let it be and play somewhere else

A is a good move to patch up that area
B, C, or D to invade
E defend your moyo
F reduce Black's territory];B[sm]C[[Pedro\] Black had no need for this now]
