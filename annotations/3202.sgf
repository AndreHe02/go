C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: Any comments are welcome since we both are quite new to the game. We both have added some questions and comments to our moves. As playing white i am quite interested on how to avoid giving black such a great mojo on the middle and about my approach move at the top left and of the followup. Thank you for taking the time to comment on the game.

My comments are marked by "al>"

Since the game was even throughout, there was a lot to comment on. I found myself lost in variations until I realized I had to limit myself that wasn't way over my head. Since I am somewhere between 15-20k in strength I might still be off here and there, especially since the game was very much about "influence playing" instead of the sequence of local skirmishes that are common at this level. It was a fun game to review - thank you for giving me this opportunity!]
;B[dq];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd]
(;B[hq]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Comments on the fuseki from here on out would be quite welcome also.

al> To secure a base immediately, the black stone should be at G3, otherwise white can play F3 and cause a real disturbance for black.

al> Otherwise, I believe that O3 is more common as a means of building territory along the bottom. Of course, there is the risk of a pincer at M3, but the possibilities for black is still better if he plays O3 before white does. I have tried to show an example in the variations.]
;W[pj];B[di]C[al> Take a look at the board at this time: neither player has secured any territory at all yet - there are plenty of opportunities to invade almost anywhere. Things are a bit tight down at the lower left, but far from settled.

al> This kind of play, mainly on the fourth line, implies that the players are fairly strong, and are both aiming for influence, rather than territory, in the beginning.

al> One standard advice to weaker players is to stay on the third line for at least 30 moves or so, as it takes some experience to cash in on influence.

al> But, what the hey, you learn by trying, and this was a quite friendly game, so it worked out alright for both players :)]
;W[fc]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Should i have done something to the lower side instead since black has approached there. Also, since black has a stone at D11 should i have approached more carefully. Could black have answered diagonally here somewhere around F15 and given up the corner?

al> This looks perfectly OK to me, although white has to decide wether to go for the sides or the center. The three initial white stones builds towards the center but they need to be followed up by moves that supports that strategy, like (I think) K16 if white wants to pursue the race for the center. This move, F17,  is clearly an attempt to take the corner or the top, rather thatn the center.

al> Since black seems set on creating strong influence towards the center, I can imagine black responding by playing H16 or G16 to white's F17.

al> Otherwise, the D11 is good for black to have in place for use when answering with a pincer at H17 and white runs out by F15 instead of jumping into the corner with C17.]
;B[db]C[al> Black D17 is better for securing the corner. What happens if white plays c17, for instance?

al> C14 is better for building territory along the left side, although that might also allow white to share the corner.

al> H17 is more aggressive, and could work well for building territory at the left side by chasing white without necessarily killing him.

al> H16 may be a more consistant move in a quest for the center.]
;W[fe]LB[cm:a][kq:b][qm:c][qg:d]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White: I guess this was just begging for a pincer.

al> W F15  induces black to enlarge the corner. W J17 instead of F15 would be a start forwhite to builld territory at the top, but since black D18 is peeping "below" white F17, it would take another move to make a  base; F18 or M17, or maybe now F15 if white wants into the center. Anyway, the exchange seems to be unfavourable for white - black gets a huge corner, 15+ pts, while white gets some 10+ along the top, maybe. (Disclaimer: my counting is poor; however black gets more points than white..)

al> Due to the black stone at D18 not being placed at D17, white could throw in a stone at C17 to mess with black. Even if that stone ends up lost, black cannot ignore it. In return white could gain influence on the upper left part of the center, or get the chance to play elsewhere before black.

al> Another option is to leave the situation immediately and let black worry about the unsettled corner, while white is going for some other area of the board; invade at C7, try to split black at F3, start to outline territory by R13 or R7 or L3. I am finding myself to like J16; it can be used either for gaining territory at the top, or gaining influence towards the center. It would be interesting to hear what someone stronger than me thinks of that option.]
;B[id]SQ[fc][fe]TR[dd]C[B J16 does not work as a pincer. The normal counter to a pincer is to run out into the board, and white is already doing that as the line between the two white stones are crossing the line between the two black stones. Also, since the J16 stone is on the fourth line instead of on the third line, it has no base, and invites white to attack it. White M16 seems like a good option.]
;W[ic]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White: Should i have already now moved towards blacks side? Or run with the 2 stones to the center and give black the top?


al> Remember that the black stone is not a severe threat to the white group yet. It is actually the other way around. This is characteristic of Go; whether you are the hunter or the prey is often more a matter of your state of mind than on the position on the board.

al> White's two stones are to think of as a wall and the approach should be to drive the black stones against it. Thus, white should play around M16, or maybe M17 or L17, depending on if white want the center or the top.

al> To engage in contact play gives black too much ability to defend himself. Things get complicated and unpredictable when contact fighting..]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[if]C[Waino (black): Is this jump too small? Could I have played H14 or J13 instead?

al> The move looks like it does not accomplish much for black. It adds no pressure on white and since the black stones are not in immediate danger it is not urgent.  The rule "stay away from thickness" applies to your own stones as well as those of the opponent, so J14 feels too close to the J16 group. A better move might be G13, or the like, trying to prevent white from coming out in the midddle, and maybe teasing him to try to cut off the two black stones. In that case, black can pretend an attempt to salvage the stones, while really outlining a moyo in the middle left of the center.

al> Remember that there are still no points secured on the board, and the top left is definitiely up for invasion, so even if white catches the two black stones, that does not mean he automatically gets the whole top. However, trying too hard to actually save the stones will settle the top in white's favour, I would say.]

(;W[hd]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White :I was wanting to settle this group as quickly as possible for moving to other places of the board before black took it all. What would have been the fastest way to settle?

al> White H16 prompts black to defend immediately and would probably lead to white getting the top while black becomes unbearably thick towards the center. White N17 instead of H16 would make this region easy enough to defend for white to play elsewhere. M17 is even safer, but slightly smaller and does not tie the group together with the corner as well as N17.

al> If you want to be able to play elsewhere, do not attack, as that results in a response that will keep you engaged longer in one place. 

al> Always look at the whole board before each move, especially if engaged in a fight. Ask yourself: are the points I am fighting for worth more than what I could gain somewhere else on the board?

al> At this point in the game, there are still no points taken by any of the players; all corners are open and only the J17 group is starting to become safe. Black is very far from having taken "it all".]
;B[he];W[gd];B[kc]
(;W[mq]C[al> This is big for white, but the group at the top is not settled yet - G18 is critical for both players.

al> The value of making life for the top group lies not in the points it might make by itself, but rather in how many points the extension of F15 might destroy in blacks potential moyo.

al> As white, I would at least play F13 before going elsewhere. That would sever the line between the black group and the D11 stone, leaving it exposed for attack from the right. Regarding the black group,  L15 looks like a critical point for both players.]

(;B[kp];W[kq]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White: I felt that i should slide underneeth, but then again i guess that gives black just more influence to the middle. Would M4 M5 or N5 have been better as working towards the middle?

al> To slide underneath black, L2 would be a better alternative. This move, L3, will prompt an answer that will stop white in his tracks. Remember that when you start a contact fight, the situation gets settled and strenghtens both players. Playing from a distance creates more possibilities, like in this case, still having the possibility to go for the middle of the board, or sliding further underneath black.]
;B[jq]
(;W[jr]C[al> A solid connection by playing M3 would have given white some peace of mind regarding this group. Now it is too easy for black to attack and build thickness towards the center in the process.]
;B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[mr]
(;B[mp]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Here im quite happt that black doesnt separate my 2 groups. But he got the center in exchange. So bad exchange from me i guess.

al> Black has to protect the back of the M3 group before ha can split white's groups.]
;W[np]C[al> Now, on the other hand, black can split the white groups, but white probably has more points to gain in the corner than what can be made by saving the L2 group.]

(;B[mo];W[ls]C[al> I believe it is questionalbe to save the L2 group at this time. White would be wiser to secure the corner with P3, for instance, to get the chance to play elsewhere.

al> The fact that black does not save the N3 stones immediately presents white with a good opprtunity to break out from the bottom into the center, but that is not something white could hace taken for granted at this time :)]
;B[on];W[pn];B[om];W[pm];B[pl];W[ol]C[al> So far this exchange has been very favourable to white; something like 25-0 in terms of points, due to the large white corner, unless black can exploit the holes at P4 and Q5 somehow. Of course, black is aiming to get his points later, but right now it doesn't look too promising, as the structure facing the center has som many weaknesses.

al> It feels right to cut here instead of defnd with R8, because of the wall black would get by playing R8 himself. On the other hand, how long can white expect black not to play M4?]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[ql]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White: Hane instead?


al> No, I don't think so, with R8 white more or less settles a large corner. Hane at O10 (which I assume you meant) would induce black to strengthen his wall towards the center, and it is also too far from the right side to secure territory for white. It won't take white out into the center, either.

al> However, R8 does not look like a critical move here, especially since white has several forcing moves to chose from, N4 for instance, but also F13 or L15, to name a few.]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[oi];W[mc]C[Waino (black): Does this have to be answered, or could I have secured my side with something around D6 instead?

al> No, I think there are other things that are more urgent for black to fix (besides the fact that D6 does not secure the side - it is still wide open). The vulnerability at M4, for instance. Black K4 would keep white from breaking out into the board. The black J16 group is not really in danger yet, especially not if black manages to establish a grip on the center.

al> THe white move here, N17, is no severe attakc on the black group, it is more for territory buidling. Although I think white should rather give priority to stopping black from sealing off the center.]
;B[me]C[Waino (black) : Was this a good place to block? Should I have selected a purely defencive (M16?) or more offencive (R12?) tactic instead?

al> To protect the group, locally, L15 is the move that creates eye space, and G13 is a good move for running away and at the same time cutting white's access to the center. But since the group is not in immediate danger, this move (N15) is neither urgent nor big. I think K4 is the critical move for black here. Remeber that the issue is to prevent white from breaking out into the center, not to save the M3 stones.]

(;W[ld]C[al> See variations on how white breaches the black wall. White M16 is another example on why attempts to penetrate a wall from the outside only makes it stronger.]
;B[kd];W[df];B[be];W[fg]TR[fe][df]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Im starting to prepare an invasion to blacks side and also towards the corner at D5.

al> I believe that the shape created by the three marked stones are considered to be, if not outright bad, at least "not good". Good shape would be if the F13 stone were placed at G13 or E12, according to my gut feeling. Of those, E12 is pushing towards the black D11 stone, which might prompt black to defend and thus strengthening the very side that white is planning to invade. G13, on the contrary, might distract black to protect his group at the top instead of guarding his left side. Also, it is a good  step out into black's potential moyo in the center.

al> To invade the left side, C7 is the natural move, followed by C9 or C4, depending on what black responds.]
;B[hh]C[al> Even if black had a solid wall at K4, this move H12 is not enough to stop white from reaching further into the center and destroy black's chances to gain many  points there.  White can easily jump to F11 and further. Black has maybe ten points in the upper left corner, and if he is not successful in sealing off the lower center, his strategy of buiding influence will have failed.

al> For that purpose, H12 should rather be at G11, I think (but the K4 vulnerability makes it futile, anyway). It is VERY HARD to make a significant amount of territory in the center, compared to at corners and sides.

al> Another thing with this move is that it is not visually appealing (to me, at least). It leaves the black stones open towards the lower right, and white can push through with M15, which would not be so funny. To settle the L16 group and gain points around M12, M15 would be a better bet.]
;W[fi];B[gk]C[Waino (black) : Is this a good place to block? Do I leave my stone at D11 too isolated?

al> In relation to the H12 stone, it is pretty good for cutting off white from the middle of the board. The D11 is beginning to look a little lonely, but it is not in any severe danger yet.]
;W[dm]C[al> Invading at the fourth line is difficult, because it is so easy for black to prevent the white stone from getting a base along the side. Black C6 or C8 would make lief hard for white here.]
;B[ek]C[al> I think C8 first, then cut the line between the white stones. Black would want to drive white down towards the lower left, gaining territory along the left side as well as protecting the center.]
;W[dk];B[dj]C[al> E10 would be safer in order to spilt white groups.]
;W[do];B[cp]C[al> This is the wrong direction. It is not good to push white out into black's planned territory (again, if it was not for the K4 vunlerablility, of course)]
;W[co];B[fq]C[al> F6 would be better for protecting the center. (I am ignoring K4 again, in order to comment locally on the moves)]
;W[bp];B[bq]
(;W[dp]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : It hit me once i placed this stone that im leaving a terrible cut at B5. I didnt want to get into a Ko since there werent that many threats yet. So i should have prolly played A5?

al> Actually, the whole board is full of suitable ko threats (M15, C17, O7, H6....) but B5 is very small compared to other possibilities, M4 being the biggest of them. The object here should be to make the group live and then reach as far out into black's would be moyo as possible.

al> If black would have had K4 in place, D4 should rather be at G6. If black cuts at B5, white gets eye shape in sente by responding with B6 so that cut is nothing to worry about, even if one stone is lost.]
;B[cq];W[bn];B[fn]C[al> Good. (Well, K4...)];W[el];B[fl];W[ej]
;B[fk];W[ck]C[al> White C12 instead of C9 would kill the D11 group, I believe.]
;B[ei];W[fh];B[fj];W[cj]C[al> C10 at B11 would be bigger. However, M4 would be a winning move, of course. Another option (if M4 was not an option) is R13, which is bigger than B11.]
;B[em];W[dn];B[dl]C[Waino (black): Was this too small? It's just one point, but also protects me from white playing atari at E6, which I would have had to protect from anyhow.

al> K4. OK, I have mentioned that already. Yes, D8 is very small. M15 is big. The upper right corner is up for grabs. The side around R13 is open, although for black it would probably be more consistent to push from the center towards the side, rather than  a regular invasion.]
;W[cl];B[of];W[pf];B[pg];W[qq]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : I had been planning on doing this for a while already but never found the right time.

al> I am not able to get black to live in the corner even without the white stone in place at R3, so I would say that white can wait with playing here until black invades. (Reservations for my poor life & death knowledge..)]

;B[oe];W[iq];B[jp];W[ip];B[io];W[hr];B[hp];W[ir]
(;B[lp]C[Waino (black): Finally my blindness ended.

al> You might as well have waited longer - once black played K4 this point was not vulnerable any more. It is not many points compared to what is open elsewhere on the board; S16 or G2, or C13 for instance, are bigger that M4. I have doodled some variations.]
;W[no];B[nn];W[bf]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Whats a better way of attacking the white 3 stones, or is there one?

al> If you pound on the group from the outside it will only get stronger, that's for sure. But on the other hand, the group has to be surrounded in order to kill it, so I am not really sure. A throw-in of some kind might do the trick; if I was black I would not take the corener for granted if my opponent was reasonalby strong.

al> However, I would worry more about blacks ability to come down from D11, or jumping to S16 and eat my points.]

(;W[qh]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Here i didnt read it out, stupid mistake

al> I can not  see that the move locally is such a big mistake, but then I am not aware of what you thought you tried to do here. The outcome might even have been better by playing like you did, because with R12 white puts pressure on black to resolve the situation around R11 before jumping into the upper right corner. The trick is get out ahead (which white, in effect, did in this case) to cut off black's access upwards before he gets the chance to go there.]

(;W[nq]C[al> I do not think that O3 is critical or big; just image what would happen if black played here instead. As far as I can judge, it is not a real threat.

;W[dh];B[bc]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: White : Was this needed by black, was it killable?

al> I do not feel that this is a critical point, even though I am not strong enough to prove it. To test your question, image that you are black, and that white played at B17 instead of black. The object for white would then be to either create a "killable shape" inside the corner or make it a liberty race between the groups. A strong player might be able to accomplish something like that - suggestions, anyone?]

[ko][lo][ar][br][cr][as][bs][cs]C[MaxMakinen [23k\]: Any overall comments? What do you think we should study specially much?
Waino (black): Thank you for taking the time to comment on this game.

al> You are welcome! It is always rewarding to be given the opportunity to review someone else game - for some reason, the effort of explaning things gives a lot of new insights.

al> In the end, black won by 9.5 pts, which is not much at this level. Had white been just a little bit more aggressive defending the endgame points, the result could very well have been the opposite. The K4 vulnerability was a massive issue, of course.

al> I got the impression that both players felt that building on the fourth line secured territory underneath. It is good to remember that playing on the third line builds (almost) instant territory, while building on the fourth builds influence, that is, power towards the center, which has to be converted to points later on.

al> It has to be repeated that building territory in the center is very hard. You get ten points in a corner with the same effort that is needed to earn one point in the center, is one way of putting it. The size of black's middle territory in this game is rarely achieved, since it is so easy for the opponent to destroy it.

al> Overall, the game was rather balanced, which is what Go is all about; a negotiation about how to split the available territory. Fighting is not really needed until negotiations break down :) Also, both players seemed to look at the whole board from time to time, judging from their ability to not get stuck in local fighting, which is good. Another good thing is that the shapes in the game was not looking as weird as what is pretty common at this level, so that feels promising as well.]
