C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

I played black. And I think I am very weak in ending the game. Therefore, originally our points are very close, but I lost a lof of points during the ending moment.

Could you give me some advices to improve these two aspects

Thank you very much.


Hello, I am Vincent Cantin from Taiwan. You're welcome.

I will do my best to focus on the important part which is the end game (also know as "yose" in japan and a lot of countries where they are using the japanese terms).

I am not sure of my level in openings and joseki, my strenght is in deep reading and attacks. So listen my advices about opening, but don't take them as "what you have to play".]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[do]C[C: I did this to prevent white from enclosure, and try to get some adventage during attack.

A: I usually use my feelings in the openning of a game. I think this move is ok for the reason you mentioned. It is better to match a feeling that a pattern, since if our own way doesn't work, it is more easier to find during analysis when the game don't go like what you wanted.]
;W[fp]
(;B[dl]C[C: At this time, I wondering whether I should play at C3, because I just want to invade the corner. However, I have a worry about the living problem of those stones. So, I played D8 first.

Q: Am I right for that? Or just still can play at C3?

A: let's forget that we are so early in the game, and let just consider the local position in this corner : If you have to worry about live, then if white play C4 then you will have to protect, and he will get some points in the corner and a easy life as well. When you have the choice bet ween 2 moves to insure life, always take the one which attack the opponent and always try to keep sente like this. D8 threaten nothing, but it can help to have a good position in the center and on the border.]

(;W[dg];B[pj]C[C: Now I think this is the right time to capture Q10.  But I am still worrying about the living of (B5 & 7) stones.

Q: Should I deal with the living of those stones first?

A: It is too early to worry about those stones. You need to finish the openning fist by playing the bigger moves first. Remember that you still have the possibility to sacrifice a group and a living space and play a killing-the-territoty-of-the-opponent instead. Here, Q10 seems good enough.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[le];B[ic];W[gc]
(;B[ie]C[C: Now, I am worrying about shuting off of my stones, so I played J15.

Q: Is this correct? Or still have some other good moves?

A: See the variations that I propose. I think that the idea to exit is a good idea, but perhaps not so early, there is some big points to do instead. The idea of making life IS a good idea here since there is a little too many white stones around to afford the sacrifice of the black stones.]
;W[dj]C[C: I just miss the chance of capturing C11. Those two stones are weak. Therefore, I wondering whether I should play C10 or C3, but I just think the corner is more important, so I did C3.

Q: Am I correct?

A: my own go proverb : always chose to attack the weaker, because you can use it and keep the sente while chasing it. Imagine if white play C4 before D10 ? The result is that his group in the bottom may be stronger and easily alife. I still think that you should play C3 instead of D8.]
;B[cq];W[pn]C[C: Now, white invasion comes, however, I don't want white to get the upper left corner, and I think I can still invade into that, so I just leave (W20) alone and invade the corner first.

Q: Am I right? Actually, I didn't respone to white invasion for I don't want white become strong because of my attack. Am I correct?

A: Yes, you are right.];B[cc]C[C: The following sequence was easy invasion and living problem. I think I did quite well. I was happy about that.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb]
(;B[bb];W[jq]C[Q: Am I need to play (B31)? Because I missed the chance to extend and attack white at K3.

A: See the variation.];B[lq]C[C: By now, middle game has entered, and the points of both sides are quite even.

A: I think you have potentially more points that white. You just didn't use this potencial and you went on some meaningless attacks instead, like G16.]
;W[pl]C[C: I just think white this move was too concentrated, so I ignored it and played for the corner.

Q: Am I correct?

A: you should not ignore *because it is too concentrated*. You should ignore if the move doesn't threaten you, and play the best move.]

(;B[dp]C[Here, D2 seems better than D4.];W[dr];B[gd]C[Q: Am I too early to pressure white? Is C2 is better?

A: R5 is better (huge). P17 is also better (bigger). P3 or O3 are more secure.]
;W[fd];B[ge];W[fe];B[gf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[np]C[This attack from white is gentle ... If I was white, I play in R3 and I destroy your potencial points.

O4 try to make some points in the center. It is better to work in the corner.]
;B[nq];W[oo]C[this move is also very gentle ...];B[oq];W[nk]
LB[ph:A][qh:B][pj:1]C[O9 is too gentle, white should play A or B in order to make the black stone alone and reduice his territory.]
;B[ni]C[your opponent gave you the opportunity to make your groups stronger. At this state, you should win the game.]
;W[og]
(;B[qh]C[what are you afraid of by playing to far ? See variations.]
;W[oi]
(;B[nj]C[You should not let the white group connect so easily. The result you have is a 2 stones group alone in the center, and cuting nothing. The second stone that you added is useless.]
;W[oj];B[nh];W[oh];B[mp];W[pk];B[qj];W[rk]C[C: Originally, I just think (W62) is a little endgame point, so I just ignored it and played at N5 and try to get out to the centre.

Q: Is S10 nessesary?


A: if you want to have your points, then yes, it is necessary. Be realist. Imagine that when white will play a s12 then it will be sente because you will have to worry about life.]

(;B[mo]C[1) N6 extends faster.

2) a black stone in H3 seems better. The invasion of the center can wait.]

(;W[qo];B[qp];W[ro]C[C: Same problem again! I just think this is a small end game point.

Q: Is S4 nessesary?

A: S4 is big for the points. Of course, if you want to win, don't let the opponent take your points. it is not a shame to play S4 at all, points are important.]
;B[jo]TR[hq]C[I don't see clearly the meaning of the stone. It doesn't help any group, it doesn't make points and it can only help white to be stronger by playing H3.]

(;W[jf]
(;B[kd]C[I don't see the meaning of this stone neither. if it is for points, then you should also consider to play near the borders.]

(;W[ke];B[je];W[lk];B[li];W[ji]C[C: Now, I realised that I have to save those four stones.]
;B[kj]C[Q: Is this move OK? Or having other good moves?

A: There is too many escape possibilities for me to be able to convert all of them. It seems that K12 also work, but L10 have the advantage to be more simple for you.]
;W[kk];B[jj];W[gh];B[hg]C[this stone is not good (not efficient), white can play J12 and separate your stones again.]

(;W[fk]
(;B[ii]C[Q: Should I extend at J10?

A: J10 doesn't help enough you to connect you stones.];W[jh]
;B[hh];W[jk]C[This is a slow move ... H3, S3, T12, C2, C9, etc ... are still playable.]

[rp][cr]C[C: I played this because I want to connect it to the center, but failed.

Q: Can I get out to the corner?

A:You don't need to connect the center, all your groups are already alive. Play the moves that give points instead.]

;W[ln];B[nm]C[good/];W[sr]C[C: Now, I realise the mistake I had.]

(;B[qr]C[Q: Am I respond correctly?

A: I propose a better sequence where you don't fill your territory in R2. See variation.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[sq];B[rr];W[sh]C[C: I just lost the sente previously, so white used the same strategy to reduce my territory.

A: yes, in fact, R2 was really useless. it can be seen easily when we compare your variation and the one I propose : the meaning of R2 is then a -1 gote move.]

A: Don't be agressive, play well. Of course, it means to attack when we can and defend when we have to.]

What aspects you can advise me to improve?


Thanks for your time reviewing my game.

A1: you need to play H7.

A2: you have 2 main problems :

1) Your moves are not enough point oriented, you played some useless-but-good-for-feeling moves around the center.

2) Your end-game is really not good. You need to think more where you can take points to your opponent and where he can take yours en sente. (A3 for example). Don't let your opponent play such sequences.
