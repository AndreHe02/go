C[I'm fearing to even look at this game I was beaten so badly. It is the 5th round of the Iwamoto tournament, which is a very good ontline tournament if for no other reason then to get to play even games with people considerably better then me.  In a typical game I'd have stones in every corner and one at tengen against funkygroov.  This was a terribly difficult game for me,  I was just plain outsmarted.
Any suggestions would be helpful.  My main question is what could poor black do?



Hi Zwom,

I ll do my best to help you in this game

Have fun :)];B[pd];W[pq];B[dd];W[dp]SQ[pq]C[before the game I had decided to adopt a sanrensei strategy.  However when I saw white had a 3-4 stone, I preferred to approach that first, and try to get a sanrensei in a moment.

yes, playing on the lower right is better. Anyway, you can't decide what to play before your opponent has played]
;B[qo];W[po]SQ[jp]TR[dp]C[Look at the variation, which is the correct joseki

This position is not "bad", but unconfortable for you, as any acceptable continuation is a hard fight to take your part on the low side
Anyway, Black will have to go in a hard fight here.


Moreover, as D4 is on a quite high position at hoshi, I think Q5 would have been better and more simple than R5, which asks for complications

White response at Q5 seems logical. He tries to make this game difficult for you.]

(;B[qp]C[This is me improvising joseki.  I don't like white tiger shapes, let alone ones that make cutting points against me.]
;W[pp];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[om]C[White is pushing from behind on the fifth line I thought this was going well for me.]
;B[pl]C[White seems to have a lot of influence but it's not exactly a thick wall.]
;W[jp]TR[om][on][po][pp][pq]C[Now White is much better, since you will have a lot of trouble taking your piece on the lower side. sanrensei on the higher side is not enough a compensation, because of white thick wall
Besides, you don't even have the lower right corner.];B[jd]
C[I get the sanrensei I was hoping for but so did he.

This move is not so good now, too defensive. You should keep sente after your bad joseki on the lower right]
;W[cf]
(;B[di]TR[ch]MA[dd][jd]C[This move leads to an awful situation :  D11 is alone, while you have to attack the lower side at the same time. I wonder how you will do these 2 things at once.
I think C12 would have been better in this situation];W[ef]
;B[fd];W[gf]C[not joseki];B[cm]TR[di]LB[ck:A][hd:B]C[This stone seemed weaker then the two stones in the corner so I played here.  Is this correct? Or do I need another move on top?


This move is dangerous as Black group is weak, at A for instance.

The weakness at B is why you usually don't play D11];W[hd]
(;B[hc]C[Why answer when you know he can cut? C16 seems better if you want to defend]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[id]TR[jd]MA[dd][fd][gc][hc]C[Now K 16 is totally useless, and you don't even have the corner. Indeed, you have to take it in gote now]
;B[qg]TR[bd]C[This seemed big but I think I needed to play at the marked point, I didn't realize I could get a large weak group now..]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[eb]
(;B[df]C[This cut, "hanekomi" is usually not recommanded, some specific cases aside. 
In other words, don't  cut a tobi if you have not already read the result]
;W[dg];B[de];W[eg];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[dh]TR[di]C[Painful for Black. The marked stone  is not any good now]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[ha];W[jc];B[fb];W[ec];B[ed]
(;W[co]TR[cq]C[Strange move, too defensive and don't take the corner as san-san is still possible. Black can still try to play in this game]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[ah];W[ci];B[bj];W[cj];B[ck]C[It seemed wise to link my corner group up to this, even though I had to drop to the first line.


yes, it is, but it is gote too, and quite painful as you are crawling on the first line while White is building moyo on the middle]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[nc]C[The result of not preventing c17 way back when is pretty severe.  I'm way behind already.]
;B[oc]C[usually, Q 17 is played because it prevents White from invading at san-san later]
;W[nd];B[db];W[dc];B[ea];W[cb];B[da];W[ca];B[fa];W[ab]C[I misread this I thought I could kill but it's a reduction in sente so it didn't really change anything it's still my turn.]
;B[ol]TR[gp]C[Is there a better move here?  I thought that this would strengthen the corner a bit.  I don't know what to do in this situation.



you want to have some moyo in the middle, which is not a bad idea.
But White is big on the bottom side
The situation is difficult here. As a mere 4k, I would have tried a light approach such as G4, to use White's weakness in the left corner]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[ml];B[je]C[This move is not very useful, while playing at the bottom is urgent.]
;W[gd];B[jg];W[qc]MA[pc][oc]C[this is painful for black.  P17 should be at Q17]
;B[qd];W[ob]C[At this point I have no idea how to catch up and still don't.  The rest of the game is me overplaying trying to catch up, but I couldn't get away with any mistakes from this kid, and just get punished for everything I try.]

(;B[jq]C[This move is too heavy, considering that you have no support here. Moreover, you let White choose the side, which is never a good thing to do.]

Indeed, it seems this game was difficult for you. You lacked some knowledge of joseki to beat White here. All 3 joseki you played were bad. 

Therefore, up to move 80 you could have catched up in this game. White didn't really punish you for your bad joseki, letting all your groups live.

I think after move 80, you started to think your only chance was to completely slice him on the bottom. But you usually can't do that in go, that's why your heavy attacks were severely punished (moves 81, 87)

Try to play lighter, without "kamikaze" attacks, even if you are not winning the game. It will probably lead to better continuations

Have more confidence too, mental is important in go :)

Good luck

Yes, it is better. Personally, I would not have played it as the game is now "one big block against the other", and it amplifies your bad joseki on the lower right.
