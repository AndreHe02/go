B#26 helps w to shape up. It doesn't threaten w, but only makes b itself overconcentrated.]
;W[gl];B[jd]C[-Direction-

l am not sure if this is bigger than playing on the left side or bottom

DW: 

Bottom is not a choice because of w G8, even if b plays at bottom, w still can invade. And b's D4 group is very thick already, playing at bottom side will probably make b overconcentrated.

B#28 looks ok, but D14 would be better. It prevents w from messing up the fuseki with something like d13.]

Bad. B has no choice but cutting w, otherwise b f13 would be wasted.

Should you distroy w's shape first, so that w can't fight back.]

B#64 is too slow, and definitely not a point. You should have seen w is aiming at the corner. At least you should do something to strengthen it. But see in variation.]
