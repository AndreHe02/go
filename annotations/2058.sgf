C[Hi, I hope it isnt too soon to submit another game. Your reviews always help so much. The moderatior told me last time that i didnt have enough comments so i tried to go through and ask questions and give a general idea of what my plan was. Thank you for your time and help as always ~Erithid

Hello, I enjoyed reviewing your game. I hope my comment can help you.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[de];B[pj];W[ec];B[eq];W[cq];B[eo]C[Up to now everything ok]
;W[cn];B[cj]C[This invasion is not so good, I think. In my opinon K4or R5 would be better]
;W[ch];B[di];W[dh]C[With this invasion you help White solidify his position in the upper left side. White has no problems with his groups.]
;B[fi];W[jd];B[oc]C[i wasnt sure whether to defend my corner or go in the k4 area. I knew that whichever i did he would do the other Should i put this defending stone on 0 17 instead? Or is there a better point?

I would rather play O17, but I dont think that your move is worse. K4 is surely a very big point which I would play now. Your corner can be defended later on, too]
;W[jp]C[I would play M3 or something like that here];B[el]C[Itried to make sure these stones could connect and make good shape

Yes, it is not bad, but your stones don´t have much trouble now in sight. This move is nevertheless good, I think because now there is not much that can happen to those stones]
;W[cl];B[ck];W[bl];B[qo]C[this move was prolly too defensive, but i knew that i was still invadeable in that corner

I don`t think that this move is bad, it takes the corner and puts a bit pressure on the K4-stone]
;W[jn];B[gk]C[I didnt think that that k6 stone required a response so i tried to push into the center with good shape

I don´t think that this is a very good move. Your stones are a bit overconcentrated in my view.
I would play at M3 or so attacking those white stones in the bottom center while extending from your shimari on the right bottom.]
;W[qj]C[ok this situation happens a lot, and i get owned every time. I dont think that that invasion should be successful, but best that I can come up with is to cut my losses

I don`t think that this invasion can be killed, but it should be good for you]
;B[qk]C[I thought botton was bigger and easier to defend

Yes, that`s right];W[qi]
(;B[ph]C[trying to restrain w

Simply play at Q11. You get cut with Q12. I think this invasion works very often and you should just let white live as small as possible and get a wall in exchange. Look at the varition, White has not many good opportunities and can not play as in the variation and Black makes big influence.]

(;W[jl]C[Is w's k8 stone important enough to sacrifice the 02 03 stones?

Look at the variation. When you play there, the white stones will have a hard time]

;B[fs];W[hs];B[cc];W[jj]C[was c17 wrong? i admit i didnt see the cut at k10, but seems like i couldnt have done much there anyhow.

c17 is a very big move especially when it is not answered];B[db]
