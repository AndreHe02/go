C[Dear reviewer: I played black and my opponent is gnugo 2.7 (computer
program). I
don't know my rank and the opponent play on IGS about 16k.  I won the game
(+5)
without komi, with komi i lose 0.5.  I played few games with human
opponents.  I'm
a beginner but I read some books.  Thank you for your commentaries.]

(;B[ed]C[This is an unusual approach
to the
3-3 stone.  The usual approach is the 4-4 point (Hoshi).  See variation from
the
previous move with one possible continuation.];W[de];B[ee]C[This response
is
ok, but...];W[df]C[it is painful to allow/force white to continue along
the 4th
line and...];B[ef]C[this move continues to push white from behind, while
not
gaining enough strength for black to compensate.  However, black's next
play...];W[dg];B[pj]TR[ed][ee][ef]C[makes efficient use of the plays in the upper left.]
;W[qo];B[qp]TR[pj]C[this is an excellent play by black for this
situation.  The presence of the marked black stone means that white may be
forced
into an inefficient extension.];W[po];B[np]C[good continuation by
black];W[ql]TR[pj]C[white would like to extend one more space from a two stone
wall,
but Q10 interferes.];B[jp]LB[qj:A][jq:B]C[I feel this is the wrong side
for
black right now--black should consider A (R10) instead to strengthen the
upper
moyo and to put additional pressure on white's group.  In this manner, black
is
forcing white while securing territory on both sides. The lower right corner
is
secure for now.  One other comment--a play in this area by black should be
at B
(K3) instead of K4.  It makes better shape and balances better with the
corner
stones.];W[ph];B[jc]LB[qj:A]C[White Q12 should not be ignored.  Black
has
several choices, but should work to keep white's stones separated and weak.
Allowing white to connect underneath and settle his stones is too lenient.
A
(R10) is still a good play];W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[pm];B[om]
;W[pi];B[pn];W[qm]C[White is settleld,
with
12+ points of territory.];B[oo];W[hp];B[dj]C[A reasonable place to start
on the
left side.];W[je]C[This move is hard to ignore...why let black's moyo be
so
easily invaded?];B[cm]C[This isn't exactly a forcing move, but white
responds];W[bn];B[bm]C[This, however, is definitely slow, and white tenukis]
;W[kc];B[id];W[kd];B[mc]C[a very slow move.  the left side and upper right side
are more
important, now.];W[eb]C[White is seeking to set black's stone floating]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[fc];W[me];B[eg]C[Also a slow move by black.]
;W[oe];B[qf]C[a
good move--gains territory and threatens at the same time.]
;W[qg];B[mk]LB[jj:A][jk:B][jl:C]C[much too close to black's wall.  Should be
around K9
or K10];W[kk];B[jn]C[This doesn't pressure white's L9 and allows white's
next
move...];W[lm];B[ln];W[mn];B[mm]C[good cut];W[pf];B[mo];W[qe]
;B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[kn];B[lo];W[km];B[ko];W[jm];B[in];W[ml]
;B[nn];W[ll];B[nl]C[black is
perfectly safe, but all of this has been relatively slow and white now is
threatening a central moyo of some size];W[hl];B[ch]C[good move]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[eh];B[fh];W[hn];B[im]C[there are still large moves than
pushing
one stone at a time.  B14, e.g.];W[ik];B[il];W[jl];B[lk];W[hk]
;B[fj]C[again,
too small.  there is no hope that black is going to kill white in the upper
left.
E18 ensures this.];W[hm];B[em];W[co];B[jj];W[jk];B[kj];W[io]
;B[jo];W[qn];B[on]C[do not need to connect at this point.];W[fi]
;B[gi];W[ei];B[gj];W[fg];B[gh];W[ej];B[gf];W[ig]C[The remainder is late middle game and end
game.
Black's instincts in the opening were quite good.  In middle game, black
should
focus on larger moves where possible.  You must consider the consequences if
you
tenuki a position and your opponent tenukis your own move--is it an even
exchange
or do you suffer in comparison?  No further comments];B[ii]
