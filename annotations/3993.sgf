AB[pd][dp]C[Hi I will try to review as good as I can];W[pp]
;B[dc];W[cj];B[cg]C[ok?

Yes I think so, I dont know if white move was good at this stage, maybe he will have space for an attack later, but for now he must extend to C7]
;W[cm];B[dn]C[and this one?

Maybe C6 or C7 if yor intention was to defend, C6 and f3 are more common.]
;W[cn];B[gq]C[Now the move should be c5, g6 was good in the previous move]
;W[mq];B[pj];W[kc];B[hc];W[nc];B[pf]C[If you think you will make sure terrotory in the 4th line think again, maybe p17 was better  or r14 following your plan]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qm];W[qn];B[kq];W[pn]C[this group you made have lots of weak points, Q12 is giant now, but also r18 is a big sente move in endgame for white and there can be problems in this 2 white stones against the only black]
;B[ol]C[I think you wanted to make a light move, dunno if you wanted to escpe or to make more points, but in this case for that is Q8 even if this is not urgent now, Q12 can divide you in 2 week groups as happened in the game.]

;W[mi]C[how to catch and enclose it? ^^*

You cant do it as far as I tried, you cant fight that kind of dragon with your shape.]

;B[ed];W[df];B[eg];W[dj];B[ej];W[ci]C[I see a problem here, in this game you left a lot of stones to cut easily by strong shapes of your opponent. The thing you have to study more is about shapes and strenghts of groups of stones.
Look how he made strong groups of stones (overconcentrated, what he made is not very good either), but you gave power to his formations, look now at D13, E11, E9, D3, the thing he made with Q12 and lots of weak stones you left in the board.]

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

Well, learn more about shapes and strong vs. weak groups, your sense of go is good for what i see but you left lots of cuts and weak groups (that was what I was marking all the time)

Have fun playing go and thanks for letting me review your game.

Any Questions, find me as Draculinio on KGS, soon you will teach me.]
