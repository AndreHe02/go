C[This is my first game i sent to GTL. I played it on IGS with 1/10 time limit, but i didn't feel time pressure in this game. Feel free to comment in any style you prefer. I add comments in SGF file on moves i thing was wrong.
Thank you in advance for the review!
This game was played on IGS on 08/02/03.
W: KonVin 17k*
B: gEn 18k*
I am White in this game and i lost 6.5 points. It was very close game and I finally lost it in the UL corner in the endgame. But i more interested in the open and middlegame. When I played, i can't find any target for attack. I'll be very appriciate if you point me out, how should i play to force Black to create weak groups or to explore any weaknesses in Black's shape.
I put some remark and suggestions to help you to understand my way of thinking.
But please feel free to comment everything you want - i'll find it usefull for sure :-)
Thank you!
And sorry for my bad English.

(;W[cn]LB[dj:C][dn:A][fq:B]C[Wrong? Black got too big LowS mojo from it.  D6 (A) better? B? C?

     Plase have a look at the comments to see my opinion....]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[hq]LB[cj:B][fq:A]TR[hq]C[I decided to invide now, not finishing with C10, becouse Black at H3 too good for B... it seems...

Yes, but it is very risky, if black p-lays at A for example, white has to defend the marked stone and then black can invade at B an you will have problems...]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[fq];W[ip];B[jq];W[jp]LB[hm:A]C[Thought about A, but decide to stengthen my wall first. Right?

Well you do strengthen the group but I think that walls are only good if they attack something OR make any territorry. Here your wall does not make anything so I prefer to play at A ou near A.

Your white is not safe yet, remember that "Walls may have ears but they surely do not have eyes"!]
;B[kp];W[hm]C[Good];B[oc];W[pf]LB[pe:A]TR[pf]C[I frequently play like this or in A, both are very strong moves.....]
;B[md]
(;W[gc]LB[cj:A]C[I thought it is sente... Now i think A (C10) is better - settle my LL group and looks good with D16... If he invade, i could develope my corner while attacking...


Remember one thing: Try not using the stone at the 4-4(Hoshi) to make territory, if you want territory in the corner try 3-4 (Komoku) or the 3-3 (San-san). As you can see it was not sente, and the white weak group can pass by a strong attack.


See variation....];B[ci];W[ck]C[So i have C9 instead of C10 and Black have C14 to extend]
;B[ce]LB[cd:A][de:B][cg:C]C[I confused with this move. How should i respond?

This is a diferent move, you can Play a A to get territory, B to get a strong wall or in C to start a fight, it is up to you, but I prefer A.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[ef]LB[cc:A]TR[ef]C[I left cut at A till endgame.
But game was close later and i felt  a bit behind... so missed the correct time :)

I prefer to conect first before playing to marked stone];B[dg]

C[You can play at A and B too, C is good to keep him from attacking to the marked groups, but it doesn´t make much territory.]

B? seems more solid...
With move at K18 i was trying to reduce B's US. But it seems i managed it to help Black...

Try to keep only a few groups on the board, if you have too many groups, one of them must be weak and can be attacked, remember the left bottom group?

Dont miss the monkey jump anymore, it is a nice territory destroing move, and it ends in sente!

I hope that I can help you improve your game, any comments will be very welcome,
