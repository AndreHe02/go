;B[np];W[on]C[Should I have just left this walking, or continued to press across row 4, or something else?  I wasn't sure, so jumped out to attack white elsewhere.

Eric: I would choose an invasion, most likely at R14. I would have similar difficulty with this decision, though.]
;B[ic]C[I'm thinking in retrospect that I should have attacked Q16 rather than attacking the stronger group of 3 stones.  However, I'm was fearful that white would counter my attack with a pincer move around L17 or M17 and end up with a large upper white territory.  (Also, I generally don't do well vs. pincer moves.)

Eric: If you are going to invade (which would be my choice also) something closer to Q16 seems better. It is by far the weakest target, which makes it easy for your invading stones to be effective. In the case of a pincer you would have the easy options of a double approach or switching to the 3-3 point, so there's nothing to worry about.]

C[Eric: I would have taken the 3-3 point instead of jumping out. That would leave you with two nice invasions, only one weakness on the board (H16, which is only a little weak), territory on the left and a moyo on the bottom. Not a bad combination. I'm not sure that P14 is a bad move, but it does complicate things for you.]
;W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi];B[fq]C[I'm not sure about this move (F3).  Should I have kept on with O12, etc?  Also, this one-step knight's move (I forget the name) doesn't seem very strong to me.  I suspect it is, but it always seems like slow play, and certainly is gote.

Eric: This seems like a good time to work on securing your moyo. I prefer K3, but that's just a feeling. Your upper right group is looking very weak, but I still get the impression that it will survive.]

;W[nh];B[qg];W[rh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[lf];W[kf]C[At this point, I knew I was in trouble with my upper middle group.

Eric: Yes, M14 was a mistake. White still has many weaknesses in this area, though, so your group should be able to escape.]
;B[kg]C[I suspect K13 would've been better, to try to break through.

Eric: Agreed. The only moves I would consider here are K13 and H18.]
;W[jg];B[mh]C[Eric: This move feels like giving up to me. Do you have a plan to save the upper group after white captures L13? L16 would give you life easily.]
;W[kh];B[ni];W[jc];B[ib];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hb];W[jb];B[ee]
;W[ed];B[nj]C[Eric: Your situation is still very good. The upper right is easily alive. White has only the top side for real territory (almost matched by your bottom territory), and you have better prospects for expansion on the left side.]
;W[qj];B[pm]C[Eric: That area is small. Leave white in peace and take easy territory on the left.]

(;B[bk]C[Eric: No need to stretch so much. Your C8 stone is overworked if you do this, and it will not be able to handle both of the jobs you are giving it. Also remember that you don't need to kill this group. You are winning, so keeping it simple is more important than getting more points.]
;W[dl];B[dm]C[Eric: That connection can't be maintained. I would recommend C9 here. If your F7 group had more liberties I might recommend D9 to continue the fight, but backing down still leaves you in the lead overall.]
;W[cm];B[ck];W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[fk]C[Is there a better way to attack this white group then just both of us extending along C and D in time with one another?

Eric: Maybe, but I like this. It keeps your F9 group solid, opening up the possibility of continuing the attack on the F6 group.]
;W[ej];B[gn]C[Eric: Too early. Your F9 group is still too weak for this. Just continue the running battle with F10.]
;W[go];B[fo]C[Eric: You are creating too many weak groups here. I like H6 better.]
;W[gm];B[hn];W[hm];B[fj];W[ei]
(;B[hl]C[Eric: If you want to attack the two white stones, I recommend hitting the head of two stones with J7. I haven't read it out completely, but it seems to work. You just need to keep all of your cutting groups on the board long enough to finish off E6.]
;W[im];B[hk]C[Eric: Even after this move, the F8 group is in horrible shape. Its only chance is for F6 to die first. With that in mind, I like B6 instead. I think you would win the capturing race.]
;W[gp];B[fp]C[Eric: Probably you were trying to protect F3. That is a valuable stone, but protecting your cutting stones is absolutely necessary at this point. The F5 stone was already safe, so J5 would be good. J6 might be even better since it also helps the F9 group.]

;W[cg];B[df]C[Eric: This is a difficult situation, but I think B13 might have worked.]
;W[ch];B[dg]C[Eric: Trading one liberty for one liberty. Not a good trade when you are behind on liberties. B13 or B14 maybe? I would focus on strengthening the upper left group because your center left group still has the option of B7.]
;W[dh];B[bf]C[At this point things started to fall apart (even more.)]
;W[bm]C[Eric: White made a critical mistake here. Your weakest group was in the upper left, but white attacked the lower left instead. B13 was the correct move.]
;B[bh]C[Eric: Good response.];W[bg];B[bi];W[af];B[ae];W[ag]
;B[dj];W[ce];B[di]C[Eric: You were winning by one liberty. This stone should have been played at B15.]
;W[be];B[ac];W[cd];B[ah];W[ad];B[dk]C[Eric: This exchange doesn't help you and is better saved as a threat for ko fights. Better to focus on saving the center group (and sacrifice what remains of your left side). The game looks hopeless at this point.]

;W[ko]C[Eric: Saving the left and the center is impressive, but you are still short on points.]
;B[nk]C[Eric: You don't have time to save that little group. M5 or N5 is still needed to save the center group.]
;W[lp]C[Eric: White could have played M5 to kill.];B[lk]C[Eric: Why ask for a ko battle? That white stone has almost no value, and white could now play N5, N6, or M5 to make a ko for the life of your center.]

Eric: You almost did save it, though. I think you missed the N4-O5 cut because you were focused on your own clever attack. Too bad it backfired.]
