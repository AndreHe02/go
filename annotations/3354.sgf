C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game, and lost by big margin. I think I failed at looking at the whole board and taking the right strategic decisions, so I appreciate your comments on this level - but all your comments on the tactics are most welcome.
Thanks, Avi

crux: Hi, my name is Bernd Schmidt, I play as 2dan at the local club.  I hope this review will be helpful.  Please use an sgf viewer that displays variations properly; I recommend qgo, ggo, glGo, cgoban1 or jago.  The KGS client, cgoban2, has some issues.  To avoid confusion, I've marked all variations that I've added with "(*)".

I think the biggest issues were mistakes in direction during the opening, and a couple of very small moves early on that caused Black to fall behind.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[kd]
;B[oc];W[ld];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[lb]C[I guess up to this point it is a normal fuseki.]
;B[jc]TR[lc]C[I decided to use the aji of the marked stone to create a group here. Was it a right decision?

crux: No.  White is strong here, so Black shouldn't be trying to build a group nearby.  This isn't using the aji, this is destroying it.  You should wait until you can see whether this peep or pulling out the stone gives you an advantage - at this early stage neither option is helpful.]
;W[kc];B[fc];W[jp]
(;B[fe];W[df];B[jb];W[fg];B[ie]C[crux: This seems quite small.]
;W[kg];B[ig]C[crux: This looks like a dame point.  I don't think White's group is in any danger of dying right now, so attacking it isn't productive.]
;W[pg];B[of]C[Is it the correct move in this situation?

crux: It seems reasonable; it keeps White separated for now.]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[nh]
(;B[nf]C[crux: I'd say this move is a problem, because it lets White connect easily and does not gain anything for Black.]
;W[lh]TR[nf]C[crux: Of the two marked stones, the white one is a lot more useful, making this a bad exchange for Black.]
;B[jh]C[crux: Too slow.  You're still taking dame points while trying to attack a group that isn't all that weak.
Look at the left side of the board - there's a wide open space there.  In the opening, the widest open area is often the one where you need to play.]
;W[mk]
(;B[nl]C[crux: Not helpful; it looks like you're trying to attack White but he's in no danger.  This move has a poor relation to your other stones.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[nk];W[mj];B[ml]
C[In view of White next move, I am not sure about this one. I probably should have pushed to N3 first.

crux: N3 is certainly joseki, but you'll probably end in gote.  Still, it's probably the best play at the moment.  The game move again feels rather slow.]
;W[mq]
(;B[no];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
(;B[qo];W[mp]C[This is a big difference relative to Black pushing at N3...]
;B[ln]C[crux: Rather small.];W[jk]C[This is a crucial point. The game will be decided by what will happen to the empty parts of the board. Is my next move the right direction?]

(;B[cn]C[Another option is shown in the variant  (Start with E14). Is it better?

crux: I'd probably prefer to wedge around C9 in order to split the side and still leave the lower left corner open.  After the game move, White gets a nice pincer.]
;W[cl];B[cj]C[crux: As you noticed, this allows White to split you in two.  Instead, entering the corner would be normal, but might not be enough in this position.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[dk]C[White splits Black, and I did not find a way to live on both sides. Did I play correctly?]
