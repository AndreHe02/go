AB[dp][pd]C[Hi thanks for the review

The review will be for both black and white.  We each have some questions throughout the game. I'll mark who wishes to know what.  Thanks again

In general I, (sleep667) am not very good at handicap games so any advice on that would also be appreciated.

* Hi, my name is Ben Bildstein. I'm something like 2 dan in Australia, but ranks are all relative, I suppose. I'll mark the beginning of my comments with an asterisk (*).

White has asked for guidance in handicap openings. Black is interested in the middle game.

I once heard (or read) a pro say that a two stone handicap game doesn't really count as a handicap game, in terms of strategy for White. You should just play like a normal game, and either you will play better and catch up, or Black will play well enough and win. In all handicap games, I think you have to accept that if Black plays as well as White, Black is going to win. Also, I think two- and three-stone handicap games are qualitatively different from higher handicap games. In two- and three-stone games, you get to take a corner.]
;W[dd];B[pp]
(;W[qn]C[* I suppose this move aims towards fighting, and is okay.

Having said that you don't need to worry about handicap strategy and can just play normal go, I'll show you what I like to do in a two-stone game. See variation.]
;B[nq];W[pf]TR[nq][qn]C[sleep667: i was thinking this was too thin but was trying to ctach up form the handicap,i was expecting the pincher but still didnt like how it turned out. your thoughts?

* In a two-stone handicap game, you can't make overplays. I.e. don't try to catch up - just play, and let the difference in strength slowly make up for the handicap. That said, when there's an option, opt for fighting rather than both sides making equal sized territories. I.e. make opportunities to catch up, but let the actual catching up happen naturally.

As for your actualy move, I think it's fine. The last two moves (marked) were both low, so it's definitely not urgent that you play in this area. Now's a good time to tenuki, and given that you've already got two stones facing the top right, it makes sense to approach it. I think I'd approach from the top because that side is high and the right side is low, but you got the right idea.]
;B[qh]C[* A pincer makes sense for Black. White's stone being on the 4th line makes it a bit harder, though, so I'm not sure where the best point is. If it's too far, White will make a double approach, which wouldn't be good for Black.]

(;W[qj]C[* My thought was the two-space extension, because then it doesn't need to be defended. See variation.]
;B[oh]C[* Good move by Black. White is weak on both sides.]
;W[pl]C[* This makes White overconcentrated.];B[qf]C[* Good attack. Serves to make black strong.]

(;W[pe]LB[cn:A][qq:B]C[* White shouldn't play here. It makes Black strong. The board is open. A is a good move. B is interesting, because White is strong here and Black has only those two stones in that area.]
;B[qe];W[od]
(;B[pg]C[* This is good shape. See variation for another possibility.]
;W[pc];B[qd]
(;W[oe]C[* This is heavy. You should only play this way if you're there are no lighter options.]
;B[qc];W[jd]LB[rp:A]C[* Black gets sente. Black is doing okay so far. Because Black doesn't particularly have anything to worry about, A would be a fine move, protecting the corner and putting pressure on theWhite group on the side.]

(;B[cf]C[This moe is also good - playing in the largest open space.]
;W[ch];B[cc]
(;W[cd]C[* This is blocking on the wrong side. Normally, the joseki is to block on this side because you capture a stone (marked) and have support here to make you stronger (marked), and if you block the other side your support stone is not as useful and you have a wall that's not doing anything and can easily be neutralised. But in this case, with k16 there already and more thickness further across the top of the board, you should definitely block the other side.See variation.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[ec]C[* Generally, you don't want to play on the third liine unless you have to, so jumping ahead like this is a good idea. Here, however, it just doesn't work, for tactical reasons. Hence the joseki is to extend once more (to d17), then to jump (to f17).]

(;W[ed]C[* This is a mistake by White, letting Black have what he wants. See variation.]
;B[fc];W[dn]
(;B[cl]C[jiva: i was wondering about this pincher,since the pincher is also already being pinchered it seemed white would ahve the advantage, the result seemed good but would the bottom be bigger?

* This move is okay. Black should not have too muchtrouble here. For territory, c6 would be okay (the White moyo can be reduced later).]
;W[cm]C[* This move isn't good. Black gets stronger, but White doesn't.]
;B[dl]C[* Black has a good move at c5 now.];W[dj]C[* Hard to be sure, but probably better to help the weak group below. Now Black has the initiative to attack White.]

(;B[en]C[sleep667:i wasnt sure how to respond to this move, could you recommend some alternative sequences?

* I think first I'd want to clear up the possibility of Black connecting underneath and leaving White floating, so play b8. Then there are some interesting options.]

(;W[eo];B[do];W[em];B[dm];W[fn];B[cn]C[* Not great, but not so bad. Black certainly did well here, but he was lucky.]

(;W[jp]C[* Not sure what this aims to do. Black's response makes good territory. Perhaps f3 would be better?]
;B[fq];W[gp]C[* Again, I'm not sure what this move does. There is no moyo here - Black has four ways to get in to the centre, from d8, o3, p12 and f17.

Let's consider the balance of territory. We'll say the lower left is secure, although c3 is certainly a weakness. We'll call the lower right secure, because if White invaded at r3, the White group above would suffer too. The top left is secure, though there's still an issue of a push at d18.

So Black's got about 20 points lower left, 10 points lower right, 15 point top right, and 10 points top left, for a total of 55.

White's got 5 points right side, maybe 10 points top, maybe 10 points left side, and maybe, tentatively, 10 points at the bottom (around the h5 area), for a total of 35 points.

So White needs either 20 points more territory (unlikely to happen), or to invade eiher at r3, c3, or d17. My feeling is that White isn't desperate enough to play r3 yet, and so instead should play s4 in sente (although perhaps leaving it in case it does become desperate would be better). d17 I don't think works yet, really, but a move like h17 would certainly make it viable. h17 would also make territory at the top, so that could be really good. And c3 is an option, though I don't really know what would happen afterwards.

But it's Black's turn, so, for Black... g16 would secure entrance in to the middle, and protect against d17... But you're ahead, so a calm terrtiory-making move like r4 can't be bad.]
;B[jf]C[* This move would make sense if White had a big moyo that you couldn't extend in to. But you had e9, n12 m4 or g16 to move in to the centre, so you really shouldn't go in so deep. Now White has something to attack.]

(;W[he]C[* This isn't the right way to attack. You're pushing Black back towards his strong p12 group, which is not wrong in itself, but you're not making any territory on the other side of h15, so it's not achieving anything. I'd still prefer h17, which makes terrtiory, helps to keep k14 cut off, and threatens to cut at d17.]
;B[hc]C[* Good! This protects against d17 and makes territory and stops White from making territory and threatens to push in even further with k18 or such.]
;W[gd];B[gc]
(;W[le]C[sleep667: since the top is still opne cause of h17 should i ahve played elsewhere ( i was concerned about the safty of trhe p16 group)

* Well, you've got thickness now with h15 and g16. Now it's time to try attacking k14. If it gets captured it will be huge for you. It's only other options are run towards p12 (relatively easy), run towards d8 (hard, and by then you'd probably have gained all the territory on the left as you chased it), or live in the middle (difficult). So stopping it running to p12 should be your first priority.

Also note that h17 is a good way tto close of the top and turn it into potential territory. I'm not sure how far Black can get with p18 - but he probably didn't know that move :)]

thank you again

Jiva: as for me i'd like some advice on my middle game. Any comments on my fighting would help me out a lot
Thank you also

* Jiva, k14 was your major middle-game mistake. Better just to reduce from the outside when there are so many openings.

It's very important to realise if you're ahead on territory and play conservatively if you are (like spending another move killing the r6 group). Also, in the middle game, don't play end-game moves like a9!

Lastly, don't play e17 again. It's not joseki, and for good reason.

* Sleep667, remember that the point of attacking is not to kill, but to make territory elsewhere (or in some case, to erase your opponent's territory elsewhere). So all you have to do is figure out which way you want your opponent's weak group to run, and then push them that way, so you can make territory while attacking. If there's nowhere you can make territory, then just play elsewhere, because that part of the board is settled.

And remember that after a 3-3 invasion (c17), you need to look at both options for blocking (c16 or d17), and see which one lets you make more territory.

Lastly, look out for double sente. Especially take note when you find yourself replying to your opponents move in a place where you think he would have responded to yours, and give yourself a slap over the wrist. The first rule of the end game is sente before gote. The second rule is don't allow your opponent to play double sente.

* To both of you, and also to anyone else reading this review, let me know if you have any questions (or corrections): ben.bildstein at gmail.com]
