(;B[mp]LB[nm:B][qq:A][lr:C]C[Not sure if this is good

Ix:  The purpose of this move is to make a group heavy (too much invested in the group to lose) and then attack it.  In this case white has several ways to make life (A-C).  Better would be to play elsewhere I think.]
;W[np];B[qq];W[qr]
(;B[rr]
(;W[lr];B[iq]C[Ix:  Learning not to make this sort of move will push you to single digit kyu easily.   This move is bad in 2 ways:

1.  It is small.  If white plays here it is about 8 points or so.   Notice how white's stones are all on the third and second line.  

2.   A white move here is not sente (a move that you are forced to respond to or BAD things happen :-)  )]
;W[fo];B[fd]C[Ix:  A move around here is big at this time.]

(;W[hc]C[Ix:  I think this move really is not so good.  It helps the top group (which is fine as it is) and the black stone is light.  Better would be to help the corner.]

(;B[df]C[Ix:  Good move!  C14 looks nice but I think in this situation the attach and decend joseki would be to nice for white.]

(;W[ee];B[cc];W[dc]C[Ix:  Correct side.];B[cd]
(;W[gf];B[de];W[ed]TR[dc][dd]C[Was that an even exchange?

Ix:  Black got the better of it. The corner, white with bad shape, and sente!]
;B[ne]C[Ix:  Good. The importance here is it pushes down white.  Thus he has little chance for a big muyo now.]
;W[oj]TR[kp][mp][iq]C[Ix:  The general rule for a cap is to respond with a knight move.  Now this gets a bit tricky.  Black does not want to provoke a fight that will get the marked stones into trouble.]

(;B[mj]C[Am I prepared for a cap here? I thought so.

Ix:  This does not work because white can easily escape.  The reason why it is so easy is because he can run faster then you can chase.  With each jump white makes black have to cut him off from two or even three directions.  Unless white is almost completely surrounded black can not keep up with the connection/make life threats and fails.  

So what black should do is make moves that gain territory while making life more difficult.   My instructor called it "building a arena" for the fight.  Only try to kill when death is certain or the game would be lost if he lives.]

(;W[oh];B[pl];W[ol];B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[ll];B[mm]C[His only group to connect to is cut off, right?

Ix:  White has easy life.  Once a group has made it to the center its extremely hard to kill.]

(;W[mh];B[ml];W[lf];B[mo]C[Ix:  This connection was important.]
;W[qh]C[Ix:  I have went over this several times and am not sure how to respond to this move.  S13 seems rather passive.  I think your choice of R18 is probably best hoping he will defend.]

(;B[pg];W[ph];B[pe];W[qg]TR[mj]C[Now he is settled.  I must have done something wrong.

Ix:  The cap without having the necessary support to kill.]

(;B[ni]C[Ix:  Here you want to attack the marked group.  First you *MUST* prepare for it.  Make a couple of moves to make living on the side impossible.  Then do this move.]

(;W[oi];B[nh];W[ri];B[rj];W[rd];B[rc];W[sh]C[Ix:  No way to kill now.  Only ko threat possibilities now.]

(;B[nr]C[I guess its a waste.  

Ix:   This sort of move helps white.  The reason is you force him to live!  These sorts of moves are ideal ko threats.  So try and put these moves off till later.   Even if you do not get into a ko battle black can still get some points here by playing at R1 rather then at O2--see variation.]
;W[or];B[ks]C[Not in sente so it was a bad move.

Ix:  Correct!  White can totally ignore this.]
(;W[md];B[op]
(;W[ns];B[fm];W[cj]C[This seems risky for white but I could not refute it.]
;B[di];W[el]C[Ix:  This peep is not so useful.  Black should not respond to it.]

(;B[em];W[fj];B[fh];W[hj];B[hh];W[jj]TR[hh]C[Ix:  I am thinking here is when black should stop the jumps.  With the marked stone he can use it to invade up top.  Now black should take the side.]

(;B[jh]
(;W[im]C[Ix:  this seems like blind running.  White is almost certainly able to connect or make eye shape now.]
;B[gn];W[kh]
(;B[kg]C[Ix:  When chasing a group try to avid this wild melee with lots of hane.  Play simpe extensions when possible.  Here white can escape.]

;B[gl];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[lm];W[mg]C[Bama [10k\]: thanks
backpacker [11k\]: thx

Ix:  The biggest flaws in black's play IMHO was too much a desire to kill a big group.  Killing big groups is not very common and extremely hard to do.  

Suggestions for improvement:
1.  Look for ways to merely "threaten" to make life difficult while picking up points.   Those jumps when you chased white for example did not gain any.  

2.  Try to make more use of extensions in fighting.  

3.  Try not to force a group to live.  You are just eliminating your own ko threats.  

I hope that these suggestions are helpful.
