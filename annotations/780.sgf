C[Hi

Thanks for reviewing my game.

my name is Niklaus and I am a 19k on KGS, my opponent (playing black) was 20k.   I have been playing Go for about 4 months now, mostly in real life against friends and family, (where I win most of the time because nobody of them plays longer and more than I do), gnugo (which I beat most of the time now) and not that much on the internet.

I'd appreciate comments on what aspects of my play need to improve most, even if my opponent didn't exploit all my errors (I won the game by 9.5 pts.)

RR:
The Reviewer's (my) name is Richard Rumley.
I am ranked around 5 kyu by the AGA, but I'm not an active player anymore.  I play some friends, who are ranked around the same level, and can hold my own.

I will put an 'RR:' infront of all my comments.

Any questions?  Please email me at richard@rumley.net.];B[dp]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[pd]C[RR:  Common opening.  All of the stones are on the 4,4 point.  None of the stones requires a follow-up move.]
;B[gq]TR[dj]C[is this a good fuseki move? it does not seem very effictient to me

RR:  A go professional once told me that during the fuseki, play the furthest away from your stones as possible!

Now, since both black stones, and both white stones are on the 4,4 point, they don't need a follow up move (same for stones on the 3,3 point.)  So, the best thing to do is to extend.  If I was black, I would play either at the marked point (san-ran-sei, please forgive my go term spellings) or an approach move to whites stones.

Remember, a stone at the 4,4 point DOES NOT get the corner, it is to be used as a wall to fight with.  By black playing at G-3, he is trying to get the corner early, however, white can come in at the 3,3 point and take it away.

So, to answer your question, no, this move is not effecient.]
;W[fc]C[RR:  White has the right idea.  Ignore Black's last move, and make the correct move.]
;B[cf];W[db];B[ck];W[id]TR[jd]C[RR:  As white, I like to play this stone at the marked (triangle) spot.  It works better with the stone in the upper right, while still holding onto the two stones in the upper left.  At it's current location, the newly-played white stone seems heavy.

If white plays at the triangled spot, black can play somewhere around H17, but then white slips into the corner at C17 and lives.]
;B[qj]C[RR:  I don't like this move.  Since the right side of the board is symetrical, and black plays in the middle, its like a passive attack move.  Black is telling white to pick what white should save, rather than black taking what he wants.
This is probably more of a style issue than a go playing issue.]
;W[qm];B[qg];W[qe]C[RR:  It is important to realize the Whites last two moves(R15 & R7) do not get the corner.  All they do is to hold back black's base along the right hand side.]
;B[mq];W[oq]C[what about this and my last move? I wanted the territory in the corner (which I got, but I'm not sure whether this was because of me or of my opponent)

RR:  I believe that the corner is still open to a 3,3 attack.

A stone on the 4,4 needs two support stones to guarantee the corner.  I don't know off the top of my head if the R7 stone protects the corner or not.  I think that black can at least get a ko in the corner.]
;B[jq]TR[mo]C[RR:  For black, I don't like this move.  It says "I only want this amount of territory."  Black should think big, and play around N5 instead.  This move would push down white on the right side, and expand black's moyo towards the lower left.  By playing the stone that black did, it severly limited any future expansion of this territory.]
;W[ol]C[RR:  At this point, the fuseki is pretty much over.  It seems that black has played all of his stones on the third line.  This means that black is going for solid foundtaions, with not much Moyo.  White has most stones one the third line as well, but has 1 extra stone on the fourth line (j-16)    Just a very rough count of the "territory" at this stage:
black 64
white 60

Bastically a tie game still.


This move by white is a good one.  White has no stones in the lower left quadrant, and needs to make sure that the whole quarter of the board doesn't become black territory.  By white pushing against the two black stones, white can then jump into the lower left somewhere, and run away to this newly played stone.]
;B[oj];W[md]TR[id][jd]C[RR:  White needed this to try and avoid a black attack.  Remember at the beginning of the game I said the the J16 stone should have been played at K16?  Wouldn't that look better right now?]
;B[cq]TR[fe]C[RR:  Black seems to be afraid of thinking big.  If I was black, I would play around F15, and build a huge moyo on the left side, then I would welcome a white attack at C3, so I could build another moyo to face the top.]
;W[ig]TR[fe]C[RR:  I don't see what this accomplishes for white.  White would be better off around F15, because it accomplishes the same thing for white as it would have for black in the previous move.  Making a good moyo at the top, and keeping black pushed down.]
;B[lj]C[RR:  Is black afraid of life on the right side, and running away?  I don't understand this move.  A move to build up big moyo on the bottom is black's highest priority now.]
;W[lg]TR[dj][ek][dg]SQ[rf][og][pi]C[RR:  There is still moyo potention and moyo reduction.  It is too early to try and solidify points in the center of the board.    A better move would be on the left side somewhere.  (see the triangle points.)

Or to hurt his base (see the square points)];B[ng];W[mn]C[RR:  same comments as before.  This move doesn't really do much.  It doesn't attack the black stones.  It doesn't isolate them, as they can still run to the left, and it doesn't make territory.

It does prevent black from playing there, which is a good thing.  Otherwise, there would be a huge moyo in the lower left.  So, white should find better ways of reducing potential moyos.]
;B[hl]C[RR:  White still has no stones in the lower left quadrant of the board.   Black seems to be making huge territory.]
;W[gi]TR[dg][ch]C[RR:  White is playing in the middle of the field.  This usually isn't good.  If white wants to play out here, white should pressure black somewhere else to get the influence.  (see triangle points.)]
;B[dh]C[RR:  Black closes off any easy way for white to reduce.]
;W[fg];B[fe];W[ge];B[eg];W[cc]C[RR:  This is a good point to play.]
;B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[km]C[RR:  What is this move trying to accomplish?  Whenever you make a move, think of these three things (in this order):

1.  Where am I weak?
2.  Where is my opponent weak?
3.  Where is the big point.

If you can answer "nowhere" to 1 & 2, then play the big point.  This move doesn't appear to answer any of these questions.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[im];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi];B[fk];W[gj];B[ff];W[gf]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[hh];B[gk];W[fi];B[eh]TR[ei]C[RR:  Black should play at E11 here.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[dj];B[dk];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi]C[RR:  Very good reduction by white.  More than I would have hoped for.]
;B[bh];W[lo];B[lp];W[mp];B[kq];W[ak]TR[al]C[better ways to reduce b territory?

RR:  The other way is the Monkey Jump, which is one space further away.  Setup this position on a board, and verify to yourself that there is no way for black cut.  It also ends with white sente, so its a great move to know.]

;B[jo];W[kp];B[jp];W[lq];B[lr]
(;W[nq];B[mr];W[lp];B[os]C[RR:  Again, the monkey jump is appropriate here.]
;W[pr];B[ps];W[rs];B[qs];W[rr];B[qr];W[qq];B[or];W[nr]C[this may be the winning move, the only capture of a bigger group]

;B[kj];W[lk];B[kh];W[kg];B[rl]C[RR:  This is a big move for black.  White should have jumped down here sooner.]
;W[mg];B[nf];W[mi];B[mj];W[ql]TR[rm]C[better alternatives?

RR:  Other than playin there first?  I would have blocked along the side.  Black can push along the edge, and there isn't much that white can do to stop black.]
;B[rk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ne]TR[rm]C[RR:  W should block black at S7.]
;B[qf];W[od];B[sn]C[RR:  Again, the monkey jump would go one space further.]
;W[rm];B[sm];W[ro];B[so];W[sq];B[rn];W[qn];B[rp];W[qo];B[sp]
;W[rq];B[qk];W[nh];B[oh];W[sh];B[si];W[se]LB[qh:a][ph:b]TR[rh]
C[RR:  White missed a great move here,  If White played at R12 (a), black would have to defend at Q12 (b), allowing white to capture the marked stone.]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[sg];W[sf];B[sh];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[dc];W[ec]

;B[qb];W[pb];B[rb];W[rd];B[mk];W[ml];B[ok];W[nl];B[pl];W[pm]
;B[jh];W[jg]C[better alternatives?

RR:  No.  You are walling off white's territory, and black is not making any points.  Good trade!]
;B[ms];W[ns];B[lh];W[ki];B[li];W[ji];B[ih];W[ii];B[ln];W[qp]
;B[sl];W[de]C[didn't work out, I thought I might kill the upper b group]
;B[ef];W[ce];B[be];W[ea]C[probably not necessary, just wanted to make sure]
;C[The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 84 territory + 12 captures + 0.5 komi = 96.5
   Black = 83 territory + 4 captures = 87
White wins by 9.5.

Thanks again for reviewing my game

RR:  You are welcome.

Here is my free information for you about your game (and it's worth every penny!)

1.  You fight well.  This game went right from the fuseki into fighting mode.  It skipped the middle game.  There are many more points to be found during the middle of the game.

2.  Learn how to make moyo, and learn how to reduce your opponent's moyo.  This is the fun of the middle game.

3.  When you study fuseki, think about #2, and how it applies to the direction you want to play.  The direction of play is a difficult topic, but its always worth just thinking about.

Good luck!
