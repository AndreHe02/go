Handicap: 3 stones

be better.];W[gd];B[cc];W[dd];B[de]C[no,  connect at c16];W[ee]
;B[ef];W[ff]C[Looking at white, I might have been a little late at countering the expanding mojo, but I can not clearly see a way to do that without placing my own stones in danger.]
;B[eg];W[gf]C[too slow for white.  Try to keep the
initaitive and erase black's handicap.
Any of the other big points would be 
better.];B[gh]C[too soon to move out into the center.
Black should aim to use the influence
of the handicap stones to make 
areas that are hard for white to 
invade.];W[fp];B[eo];W[dq]C[
White should think about the
overall direction of play here.  You
are more or less forcing black
to form a wall that consolidates
his left side, and with such an
agressive move, you can't expect
to end the sequence with sente.];B[cq];W[ep];B[co];W[fo];B[en]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[eq];B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[kq]C[white has somehting, but black
got more.  One more move on the
left and it will really be too late for
white.];B[mq]C[good];W[qh];B[qj]C[i was trying to keep white from getting any base and eyeshape there.

R10 now becomes a target,
and the areas at top right and bottom
right will shrink to nearly nothing.

I think black needs to respond
in the corner rather than opening
another front.];W[rf];B[rd];W[oh];B[oj];W[ng];B[ne];W[md];B[iq]
C[Same idea, distroy white base

The top right is too insecure
to leave it yet.  It makes a big
difference if the white side group 
connnects to the top  or not, and
it makes a big different if black 
ends up with eyes in the corner.

also, J3 is the wrong place to 
attack on the bottom.  The
wall is too solid  You should aim
to contain, not kill, and build
thickness outside.];W[jp]C[I expected white to jump at L5 so I was a little suprised by this move

-- so you won't be surprised next time,
right?  white has a nice wall at the left,
he's just using it here.  L5 would be
correct if the white stone didn't have
any support.];B[ho]C[trying 2 things here. Getting connection, keep the 2 black goups separated]

;B[mj]C[I tried to make a sente move to be able to take the ko back, but was afraid to overstretch it.

A good thought, but I think white
has too many options to be bothered.
Best would be to bank this ko and
see what develops later.];W[jn]C[This ends any possibility of a ko, which
I think is the best thing for white to do.];B[me];W[le];B[mg]

;W[ri];B[rj];W[re];B[kg]C[
although the black left side looks
unassailable, reducing it (for white)
or shoring it up (for black) ought to
be the first priority.  The outcome of
the game really hinges on if this area
survives as a black pond.];W[hm]C[
white agrees with me, but this is a
very timid move.];B[fl];W[jf]C[this seems small];B[ig];W[qq]

Result W+3.5

Black is attacking a bit too wildly.
Especially  when taking a handicap,
your goal should be to exchange
and hold the better end of the deal,
rather than to attack and kill everyting.])
