C[Dear reviewer,

I played black in this game.
Apart from your general remarks, I would be greatful to hear your opinion on the following points:
1) Alternatives for my fuseki in the lower left corner.
2) I have problems with shape (as you can see in this game). Your remarks, suggestions are welcome.
3) At several points in the game I thought about playing kikashi's against the lower left white group, but I didn't. Was that right ?]

;B[pp];W[cp];B[ep];W[gp]C[eek: Very aggressive choice.];B[en]
;W[cn];B[ip]LB[cq:a][bq:b]C[eek: Black usually exchanges 'a' for 'b' first to limit White's possibilities here.]
;W[gn];B[el];W[dm];B[em];W[eq];B[dq];W[dp]
(;B[fq]TR[gn][gp]C[eek: It is important to keep the marked white stones disconnected from the ones on the side. The variation seems to do that.]
;W[eo];B[fp];W[fo];B[gq]C[eek: Cutting off three black stones makes this a good result for White.]
;W[gl];B[dk]LB[dn:a][do:b][cm:c]C[eek: This is heavy. The most aggressive thing Black could do with his stones would be a-b-c which isn't very threatening to White. Thus Black's stones are of very limited use and should be treated lightly. So I suggest extending a bit (2 points?) farther up and be ready to sacrifice the three stones if needed in exchange for a settled group on the left side.]
;W[di]C[eek: By attacking this heavy group White gets a good initiative.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[gj];W[ej];B[fl];W[hm];B[fk]C[eek: This is probably the best shape for Black (I found no serious shape flaws in your game.)]
;W[ii];B[gh];W[hg]C[eek: Perhaps White overstretches here.  If he plays from the other side, which is also weaker, he will gain territory while Black remains insecure.]
;B[dg]C[eek: A good chance and Black takes it!];W[cg];B[cf]

[hl:b]C[eek: Black is out of immediate danger without losing too much ground.

Regarding your question about playing kikashi against the white group, I guess one candidate is 'a', but it is not certain that white will answer it. If he does answer, it looks like a good exchange for you, but the timing is difficult.]
;B[pc];W[qk];B[jd]TR[ec][ed]C[eek: Maybe better to hold back a line here or even play on the right instead. The marked stones are fairly solid and it is hard anyway for White to make territory here, since your left group can jump out.]

LB[iq:a][jq:b]C[eek: If White lives inside your area, this move will only be good if it is possible to profitably attack the group above. Maybe it is, but otherwise you could consider 'a' or 'b'.]
;W[nr];B[os];W[jq];B[jo]LB[iq:a]C[eek:  The risk is that you lose tempo in the fight if you still have to go back and defend here later - therefore 'a' would be the honte (but I can't promose that it is correct here).]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[lp]C[eek: Black has left too many weaknesses behind to feel really comfortable with such an aggressive move.]
;W[kp];B[mq];W[iq]C[eek: This is troublesome. This group is cut off and eyeless and the bottom right black group has some weaknesses too.]
;B[jm];W[mn];B[ll];W[nm];B[pl];W[mk]C[Not sure anymore of the exact order of moves from here]

[rp:b][rq:c][sr:d][rm:e]C[eek: Black could play 'a' instead, which threatens to kill the corner with b-c-d. Then he would have a spare eye (without ko) at 'e'.]
;W[nj];B[om]C[eek: Big, of course, but if the centre dies ...]
