RE[W+2.5]

AB[dd][pp]C[Hi. This is a game I played on IGS. Even though I (White) won marginally, I would like comments on how to handle some moves by black, and also my endgame (in which I believe I made a lot of mistakes)

Thank you.];W[dq];B[pd];W[cf];B[be]C[I had absolutely no idea on how to handle a move like this. So, I tried...things.


It's a very territory-oriented move -- treating your stone lightly was a good idea.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[bf];W[de]C[I know F17 is the joseki, but I didn't know how to follow it up. I decided on this to connect my stones.

-->this is a bad move here.  B has invested a lot of stones in small territory, so that's not good for him.  However, he is strong, so you want to play LIGHTLY with your c14 stone.  The logic here is more important than the move itself.  

Think about your c14 stone.  It has very little potential to become territory, and no potential at all to attack the over-secure black group.   Moreover,  b's territory is on the second line -- so you can just look at your c14 stone as a potential (later) vantage point from which to keep him pressed down, or a useful stepping stone to invade from if he tries to make a big moyo on the right.  You really don't want to play here right away.    Extend away from your heavy group around k16/k17 on top to make them strong and efficient.  You STILL have the 3x3 invasion here (c17) anyway....]
;B[cg];W[cd]C[Looks like a tesuji but only strengthens black.]
;B[cc];W[ed];B[dc];W[ce];B[bd]MA[cd][ce][cf][de]C[this was a very bad sequence for white.  You lose the corner invasion and gain only heaviness.  Look at white's shape -- what are your c16stones (marked) accomplishing?  This shape and your need to play another move to protect it should tell you white is not good here.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[jc];B[eg]C[this is not good timing by b.   Both groups already stabilized, and b can later cap around k15 if w moyo starts getting big.]
;W[nq];B[or]C[Another one to deal with :)];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn]
;B[nr];W[qf]C[This tenuki is very good, and in the right direction.  B's corner looks lonely and white's stones are coordinated.  A pincer by b can start a complicated fight but w has the advantage on both stones.]
;B[rd]C[From my opponent's moves thus far, I got the impression that he was very, very territorial.

Yeah, looks that way.];W[pj];B[qh]C[w should be happy to keep the lone b stone separated from the others, than hit o17 for a nice squeeze on the top.  Just jumping to p14 here gives w a sente attack on the upper corner, expanding the top side, and then lots to look forward to in chasing the invader.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[qg];W[pg];B[rf]C[Just q14 better than r 15.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[co];B[jq]C[b so low... has played so few moves above the third line...
should be expanding his investment on the right rather than trying to develop the bottom, which is blocked by white d3 AND reduced by o3.]
;W[cl]C[Too slow? I wanted to avoid being driven towards the black wall.

-no, I think this is an ok extension -- not slow at all considering you don't want to play too near b's thickness.]
;B[cj]C[Bad move by b to answer this move -- too many stones in upper left for too few points.  Move on top much bigger]
;W[op]C[top right still begging to be played.];B[oq];W[po];B[qp]
;W[np];B[gq]C[while ok for the bottom, b needs to think a little off the third line.]
;W[qj]C[the top is so urgent -- you both have investments up there, it's whoever plays first!]
;B[mc]C[b VERY happy to get this point, puts him right back in the game.]
;W[lq];B[mr];W[ip];B[iq];W[jp]C[good job pushing down on his already low and strong group to make a moyo]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[kp];W[ko];B[kq];W[lp];B[hp];W[lk]C[I know the proverb says not to use tthickness  to build territory, but I had no idea whatt to attack using the thickness. Any ideas?

b very stable almost everywhere.  Besides trying someting at p17, you have very few sente moves.  There always comes a time when you turn your moyo into territory....]
;B[mf];W[oe];B[nd];W[je];B[ff];W[ri];B[rg]C[I think this was a really bad mistake by my opponent. It definitely affected the final outcome.

Not really bad -- it's a good number of points];W[jk]C[n12 for expanding your moyo, or if you really want the bottom j6 builds more territory --with k9 you are expanding over neutral ground.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[ho];W[mh]C[got n12 anyway.  :-)];B[jm];W[km]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[im];W[ll]C[I wasn't sure about this move. Is it necessary?

nope, unnecessary, though b can try some complicated things without it.  Much more fun to cut at f 13]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[fe];W[ee];B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[hc];B[jd];W[kd]
;B[kc]C[Bad mistake by my opponent?

yes, big.];W[ke]C[Very good move by white.  b loses either l17 or the three stones at j17]
;B[hf];W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[lg]C[I couldn't understand why Black played L18 and then tenuki-ed.

he should have gotten n18 in sente at least.  But I am assuming he was worried about white trapping n14 for an even bigger center.]
