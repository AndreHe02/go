AB[pd][dp]C[This is the first game I try to comment and I have played less than 50 games on a full 19x19 board so my own comments might not be that good. Any advice on misstakes and what to work on is appreciated.  I'm playing as black.

S> Hi, I'm Scartol. All my comments will have this S> mark in front. From the looks of things, you suffer from a problem most people around 20k have -- too much enthusiasm for capturing small groups and difficulty looking at the whole board. Let's see if I can help out.]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[ip];B[qo]C[S> This is all fine so far. Most of it is joseki.]
;W[qm]
(;B[qq]C[S> This is common, but I prefer to get out into the middle first. I know how nice it is to have a base to work from, but keeping white split apart is important too (and getting into the middle does this). See the variation.]
;W[qr]
(;B[pp];W[rq]C[S> Your move allows white to play this atari.]
;B[qp]C[S> Now black's group is thick and overconcentrated.]
;W[oq];B[op]LB[nn:A][om:B]C[S> This is pretty slow. It's tempting to run along with white. but it's better to pull back and look at the whole board. How about A or B?]
;W[np];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[on];B[no];W[mp]C[S> This is silly of white. She should realize her stone is in a ladder and let it go.]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[mn];W[lq];B[lo]LB[on:A][qm:B]C[I dont really know what to think about the black group. It hardly makes any teritory at all and is closed in on most sides. On the other hand I kept it alive and having a strong group here proved usefull later.

S> This exchange definitely worked out well for black. The marked white stones are all alone, and black can gain by putting pressure on them. See the variation coming up.]
;W[mr]
(;B[io]LB[in:A]C[I have given up on the down edge but hope to cover it with a wall of black stones to compensate for whites teritory.
S> This contact play is much too close. Playing here is definitely not the most urgent move on the board -- now would be a good time to attack on the right (see variation) or defend the top or left. But if you do play here, you should play at A, to give yourself a little more room. Playing this close is asking for trouble, and you shouldn't start fights when you're in this advantaged situation.]
;W[pj]C[S> Wow, I hadn't seen this move when I made that variation. Just goes to show that your opponent's good move is often your good move.]

(;B[nc]C[S> This is too soon to play such a defensive move. Play on the right first and use the pressure on white to expand your moyo. See variation.]
;W[qf];B[mj]LB[nj:A][qd:B][jd:C][dj:D]C[Mabye I should have tried to secure the top right corner. But trying to keep whites right side away from the rest of the board looked like a good idea too.
S> Well, this move feels like it's very uncertain of its mission. If you're going to cap, a one-space approach at A is the way to go. If you're going to expand from the bottom, do it more in the middle. If you're expanding from the top, play closer to the top. The better move is at B, C, or D. These are all more useful.]
;W[fc];B[cf]LB[ic:A]C[S> This is okay, but a play at A does two things -- attacks white, so she has to either run or play the double approach, and it expands your top right moyo. Multi-purpose moves are usually the best ones. (A is as far as you want to go from the stones on the right -- no more than 5 spaces is the rule)]
;W[ic]C[S> Wow. Again -- your opponent's good move is your own.]
;B[kc];W[ch];B[ck]C[S> Good -- apply the pressure.];W[eg];B[fo]
LB[fe:A]C[I was thinking that I could live in the top left corner eaven if I spent a move somewhere else.
Keeping white locked down seems important.
S> Yes, but A is better, since it threatens to keep white split apart.]
;W[dj]
(;B[ek]C[S> The variation is more usual. Get thick and you won't have to worry about getting cut.]
;W[ej];B[cj];W[ci];B[dk];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[gl];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[hj];B[ik];W[ij];B[hm];W[jk];B[il];W[ki];B[fe]LB[mj:A][ml:B]
[mh:C]C[White is surrounding a huge territory so I'm hoping to make it a bit smaller and hopfully gain some room for my corner stones.

S> Yes, but white is threatening to surround the A black stone. Playing at B or C is therefore urgent.]

(;W[ge]C[What if white would play E15?

S> Let's have a look. See variation.];B[ff];W[gg]
(;B[ef]C[S> Aiiee! No -- white is spread out; use that! See variation.]
;W[je];B[ke]LB[le:A]C[S> Again, too close. A is better.];W[kf]
;B[lf]LB[le:A]C[S> Here you've given white an atari cutting point at A. Get thick first by playing A yourself.]
;W[lg];B[mf]C[S> Better.];W[mg];B[ng];W[nh];B[og];W[ph];B[pg]
LB[mj:A][ml:B]C[White is getting his top-left and right edge group together. This cant be good but I have no idea if I could have avoided that.

S> Yes, by not playing so closely to white when she started to build that wall. However, the A black stone is now extremely isolated. Playing B is absolutely essential.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[db]C[I was sure the black group here was safe but this move make me wonder if it will stay alive.

S> Let's see.]
(;B[ec]C[S> This is definitely not the way. See variation.]
;W[eb];B[fd];W[dc];B[ed];W[cd]
(;B[bd]C[S> White didn't protect the white stone A. Use that to link up to the right. See variation.]
;W[bc];B[ce];W[be];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[bf];W[ad]
(;B[af]C[S> Go aherad and capture -- white has to connect anyway. See variation.]
;W[ac];B[ae]C[The group is saved, but was it luck or skill?

S> It's skill; white didn't protect her cutting points. But making more eyespace for yourself at the start of this skirmish is even more skillful.]
;W[bg];B[di]LB[ml:A][jf:B][cr:C]C[S> As you know (hopefully), this doesn't do much. A, B and C are all more valuable.]
;W[ei];B[dh];W[dg];B[df]C[S> Not very urgent. Even if white pushes in, you can still make an eye.]
;W[ml]C[S> This is probably the game-winning move. Now white can surround a BIG piece of territory in the middle. Saving that one stone may not seem like much, but when it's a way into white's area, it's very valuable and needs to be protected and linked up. At the very least, black needs to play at P12 now, and try to use cutting points to break inside. See variation.]

(;B[kq];W[lr];B[jp];W[jr]
(;B[jq]C[S> Be more assertive! Use atari to break white apart. See variation.]

;W[nm]LB[oh:A]C[S> Here again, pushing at A can do more for black than just hoping white won't seal up (as she does). Make cutting points, then cut.]

S> This is better; but getting into white's territory is even better. A and B are more valuable.]

S> Yes, well, we've all done this at some point or another.]
;W[re];B[sc]LB[rc:A]C[Good or bad?   White at S17 looks thretening.
S> You can capture, so you're okay. In general, though, it's better to play at A, get thick, and not give white the chance to cut.]

White win with 2,5 points.

S> Well, the half-point ko is usually meaningless. Best to let those go. You've got a good fighting style about you .. Just work on seeing the whole board and keeping your stones connected. Keep practicing and have fun!
