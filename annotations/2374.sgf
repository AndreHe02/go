;B[dd]C[I believe that heading into the endgame that I had a good lead, but it slipped away. This happens to me often, that I get a good lead and can't hold it. What could I have done differently.

;B[pf];W[qe]C[No use fighting this early. A stone around N17 would do wonders for your territory count.]
;B[nf];W[nd]C[Small move here. You would be better off with N17]
;B[oi];W[pj]C[Another relatively small move considering the size of unplayed spaces. You seem more interested in containing B rather than getting more territory.]
;B[jc];W[jp]C[Knowing now that he squeezed me into the Q16 corner, should I have played M17 at this point instead?

M17 is small. You need not respond to all the move that B makes. Its more important to get your own territory.]
;B[li];W[nk];B[nq];W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[lr];W[mq]C[Another small move here. This is actually a good opportunity to get territory at the left side which is still empty.]

C[I knew I had to invade his moyo, so I just picked a point in the middle so I could flow in any direction. Was this the best?

Not the middle. Try invading at the sides or corner first. Its easier to form a live group there. C14 seems like a good point]

Are you sure this is a good presence? Your stones are far apart and are surrounded by B.]

You didn't have much territory at the center anyway. To be able to reduce B by this much is already very good.]

D12 and C9 already form a strong foundation. Also, they are near each other and at the side which makes it easy to form a living group. Unless B makes a big mistake, that territory is not invadable.

Also, the territory you have at this point is still lesser than B.]

;W[an];B[ak];W[am];B[cl];W[jl];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[In this game, you have let B dominate throughout by responding to his moves all the time. At no time did you gain the upper hand. You should learn to ignore small moves by B and focus on getting territory instead of containing B stones.

There were opportunities in the game where you could have gotten more territory but those came early in the game. You could have ignored some moves by B and gotten yourself more territory.

There was relatively little fighting in this game. B was content to let you respond to his moves while he gets territory in the meantime.

Always responding to an opponent's move is a habit you have to kick. Its a good way to let your opponent lead you throughout the whole game.

This is the end of my review. If you have any other questions, feel free to drop me an email.
