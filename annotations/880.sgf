C[Dear Andras,

Thanks for letting me review this game, where you took White against GnuGo. As you probably know, computer programs are not yet strong Go opponents. Some of GnuGo's moves in this game simply make no sense to me. Even so, it was an interesting game.

My comments are prefaced with MM.];B[cj];W[ej]C[MM: Approaching with this kakari is probably OK, but maybe a little aggressive. More usual would be to play in one of the three empty corners.]
;B[kk]MA[dc][dd][cd][dh][gk][gj][hj][hk][kd][kc][jc][jd][di]
[cg][dg]C[MM: This feels a little weird. It doesn't seem to build with the black stone already on the board. I would expect something at one of the marked points instead.]
;W[jj];B[jc];W[je];B[dc];W[de]C[The first four moves seemed quite natural for me

MM: They seem a bit strange to me, but they're interesting.

Black is in good position to take the corners, but White may dominate the center. White's position aims to take 'influence', while Black has a good grip on some 'territory'. Ultimately, 'territory' is what wins the game... but in the mid-game, White may use 'influence' to attack and take enough territory to win.]
;B[ke];W[jd]C[It was already less natural - other possibility I thought of: W L8
I know something about the opening patterns, but little about the connections of these four for example.

MM: This may be OK, even though Black's natural followup at L10 gives Black the good 'hane at the head of two stones' shape. L8 also seems OK. L10 would probably work too. Even after trying some variations, I am not strong enough to be sure which is the best. This move -- and the next three or four -- are the main reason I'm asking the GTL for a review of my review.]
;B[kd]
(;W[ic]C[MM: There is a proverb that says 'hane at the head of two stones.' This good shape is what Black has against the White stones in the upper right. But I think it's OK for White in this case, because while Black defends the corner, White can build strength to attack the left.

A more forceful way to play would be to first put a sacrifice stone at L11 ... 'hane at the head of two'... and follow up with the atari at J11. This would give White sente for attacking the left. If Black doesn't take the sacrifice, then White can live in the corner.]
;B[jb];W[ib]MA[hd]C[MM: Maybe a wasted stone? Better to protect the cutting point with H10?]
;B[kj]C[MM: See, here White loses sente. Black can afford to leave the corner fight, and play in another part of the board. This probably would not happen if White had sacrificed a stone at L11.

Even so, White can attack the upper right corner later, with a stone at L12. But this just reduces Black's area rather than killing it.]
;W[ji]MA[jk][id]C[MM: I think I'd prefer to block low at K3.

At some point, you need a move like H10 to cover the cutting point at J10. This probably isn't the time, but you should do it soon.]
;B[ek];W[fk]C[Here I tried the other possibility (as mentioned before)]
;B[dk];W[fj]MA[ki][cd][bd][fc][lh]C[MM: Solid, but too slow, in my opinion. White's stones feel unified and strong, so attack! I like one of the marked points better. Of these, perhaps F11 is best since it helps that pesky weakness at J10.]
;B[ch];W[jk];B[lh];W[jg]MA[kg]C[MM: At first, I thought you didn't need this move at K7. But if Black gets that point, then the fighting becomes complicated. So it's probably a good place for White to play. L7 might be better -- it would threaten to cut Black, so it would keep sente, I think.]
;B[ce]C[MM: A big move for Black, and a lost opportunity for White.

After quickly counting, I estimate Black probably has almost 60 points on the right and left now. White seems to have less than 50 points in the center, top, and bottom, not including komi. Much is still unsettled, but it looks like a difficult game for White.]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[dg]MA[bf]C[MM: Too passive. Play to split the opponent's stones apart! B7 seems natural.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[id]C[MM: This is what happens when White doesn't cover his cutting points.]
;W[hd];B[jf];W[ie];B[if]C[MM: Ouch -- Black is driving a wedge through White's stones!]
;W[lg];B[lf]MA[kf][he]C[MM: Eh, maybe not Black's best move. L8 might be better, or H9.]
;W[kh];B[kg]C[MM: Weird time and place for a ko. Computers do the strangest things.]
;W[kf];B[jl]C[MM: Not a very compelling ko threat, is it?];W[li]
;B[ll]MA[hl]C[MM: Black misses the chance to destroy White's territory. Black should go to H2 first.]
;W[kg]MA[le]C[I wanted to be sure about the right side.

MM: You would probably be OK by attacking at M9 instead, because I think you can win the ko. Especially since Black is a computer, and computers are notoriously bad at ko. But it makes sense to connect a ko when you want to be sure.]
;B[lc]C[MM: Black's corner looks safe now. But White seems to have caught up a bit, thanks to Black messing up the ko fight and the right side and corners. Now the game looks about even.]
;W[le]MA[bf][il]C[I tried to attack the group in the upper right corner

MM: A little too late. Better to split the left side, or defend the bottom.]
;B[la]C[MM: Strange. I think Black at M10 would be safe, and keep more points for Black.]

(;W[ja]C[MM: Instead, I think I'd try the M10 attack here.]
;B[kb];W[ld];B[mb]C[MM: Black now alive.];W[kc]MA[kb][la][mb]
[lc]C[But I did not really manage it.

MM: No, but you did as well as possible in this situation. The biggest mistake is capturing those two stones -- they are not important.

Black is alive once there are stones on each of the 1-2 and 2-3 points (marked). In fact, those 4 points constitute the smallest formation that is unconditionally alive.

But, Black has only two points of territory, and is cut off from all the other black stones, so this is good for White. Now White seems to have a clear lead.]
;B[bf]C[MM: A big move! Too bad White didn't go there instead of capturing two stones.]
;W[kd]C[MM: Only one stone. You have much bigger plays available. Don't be afraid to give up a few unimportant stones.]
;B[hl]C[MM: Ouch! Black got two big moves in a row. White's lead is disappearing quickly. Contrast the value of Black's last two moves with the 6 points gained by White's last two moves.]
;W[gl]MA[hk]C[MM: This looks good at first, but H3 may work better. Even though Black connects along the bottom, H3 will stop Black from reducing White's center.]
;B[hj]MA[if][jf]C[MM: This is horrible for White. If Black rescues those two stones at J8, White might as well resign.]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[gk];B[ij];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hf]MA[ed]C[MM: Not Black's strongest follow-up. Black should play something like E10 first.]
;W[db];B[cb]
(;W[ec]C[MM: I'm don't think White can afford this. Better to play solidly at E10, and give up a stone.]
;B[ed];W[eb];B[ee];W[df]MA[dd][hf][if][jf]C[MM: Not necessary yet, and forces Black to connect at D10. Better to make sure you capture the three Black stones, or else White's center territory will come to nothing.]
;B[dd];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[cg];W[eg];B[fg]
(;W[gg]MA[cf][de][df][dg][eg][fh]C[MM: This is no good. After Black extends to F6, there's no way to save the 5 stones on the left. But White doesn't seem to have anything else that works, either.]
;B[fh];W[eh]MA[ei]C[MM: Not safe. Black can capture with E5. But White probably has to give these up anyway, in order to save some center territory.]
;B[gh];W[hi]
(;B[gj]C[MM: A blunder by Black. J5 would be better.];W[gi]
;B[hh]MA[ei]C[MM: This should be E5 instead.  White got lucky.]

(;W[fi]TR[eh][eg][dg][df][de][cf]C[To save the marked group.

MM: Later you mention having this at E5 instead, but this F5 works better.]
;B[di];W[ei]C[Still necessary for saving it.
Maybe it had been better to do this directly instead of the former move.

MM: No, because then Black at J5 would save 7 black stones and leave White with nothing.]

(;W[ea]C[MM: You have bigger endgame moves you can play to keep sente.]
;B[ca];W[mk];B[ml];W[lj];B[lk];W[mj]MA[md]C[MM: Just two points, and gote too. Play N10 first.]
;B[fl]MA[ki]C[MM: Black should first gain one point in sente with the atari at L5, then come back for this.]
;W[fm];B[md]C[MM: Black plays gote. Good for White.];W[me];B[mc]
;W[ia]C[MM: This is sente, but not really a point. The score is the same whether White plays J13 first or Black plays L13 first. So, it is less important than White N10 would have been. Maybe it's better to leave this for ko threat if necessary.]
;B[ka];W[em]MA[be][bg]C[MM: Good.

The cuts at B9 and B7 look interesting, but as far as I can tell, they ultimately don't change the score.]

[mm]C[The endgame I found trivial

The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 29 territory + 15 captures + 5.5 komi = 49.5
   Black = 37 territory + 0 captures = 37
White wins by 12.5.

MM: Thanks for the chance to review such an interesting game.

Your opening was unusual and interesting. In the middle game, you missed some chances to make your territory larger and safe, and by move 80, I was sure you had lost. But you persisted, and when GnuGo made some mistakes, you made a good recovery. Your endgame could have been a little more precise, but was OK.

I don't know if you play humans much. If you don't, I think you should try it. You are strong enough now to enjoy competition in the double-digit kyu ranks, and live opponents are always available on the Internet.

For improvement, I would suggest simply playing more, and studying life and death of course. More specifically, practice giving up sacrifice stones to gain tactical or strategic advantage. On a related note -- do not rescue small groups of stones unless they serve an important function, like separating they opponent's groups. Similarly, don't capture small groups of stones until the endgame -- unless you need to capture so you can connect or live.

(;W[kc]C[MM: After White's sacrifice, Black has a couple of options: extend to the left, but then White can attack the right.. or defend the corner, but then White can attack the left.

...I'm sorry for the large number of branching variations here. What are the best plays for White and Black? It's an interesting question, and I don't know the answer. Hopefully, the next GTL reviewer may know.

For now, don't get bogged down in the details. The main idea I want to suggest is to think about sacrificing a few stones, as a tactic for building strength somewhere else or for keeping sente.]
