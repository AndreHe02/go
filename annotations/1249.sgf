C[rika:
Hi,  I'm Chun-Kit reviewing a game requested by CarlJung (IGS 25k) who played black.
Currently I'm 10k IGS (nick: hotaru9), 7k KGS (nick: rika), 8k DE. So our difference in IGS is 15 stones which is rather big. I hope despite of that I can give you some good tips, good moves, good shapes...]
;B[dp]TR[sa][rb][qc][pd][oe][nf][mg][lh][ki][jj][kj][lj][mj]
[nj][oj][pj][qj][rj][sj]C[Just to remember when playing an even game on a real board. It's polite to play inside the triangled zone.
Since I haven't heard an etiquette for Internet Go so far, no opponent will point it out.]
;W[pc];B[qp];W[cd];B[kq]C[The Low Chinese Fuseki
If you want to read the idea of that Fuseki, I recommend the articles of Charles Matthews http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/fuseki/09/ following.
and the book "The Chinese Opening" by current Honinbo Kato Kensei (Masao)
I rarely play these Fuseki myself, so I will try to give some theories since your opponent destroyed the formation and posses the lines 1-4]
;W[pg]C[A rather irregular opening move. It doesn't enclosure the corner nor it's a good extention. Natural weakness is Q15 (see var). To say how that will develop is difficult.]

(;B[pj]C[This is strategically important point of the Chinese Fuseki.]
;W[cn]
(;B[ed]C[Playing elsewhere after wC6 is ok. But white can destroy the Chinese Formation by playing F3 or F4. So bF4 is in my eyes a must]
;W[ec]
(;B[dj]C[not consistent your style, he attached you inviting you to make your bE16 stronger, but playing tenuki (elsewhere) at this point has one problem: You already gave up your interest in the upper left corner and want to harass wC6 which has no problem to develop himself.
I'll give you some continuations/josekis in the upper left.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cl]
(;B[dl]C[this black stone just help white to dive into the middle (a "thank you"-move so to speak). If you want to keep white low, stay away, don't make contact moves, I recommend bE6 or bE7]
;W[dm];B[em];W[en];B[fn]C[the double hane doesn't work with wC6. bD4 is in danger]
;W[md]C[white wants to make territory in the upper right corner and aims for K17.]
;B[eo]TR[el][fm][fo]C[too small. makes the white group strong and (more important) leaving cutting points at the triangle marks]
;W[dn]
(;B[mh]C[recalling wN16. It's easier to make points in the corner and at the side, so in my opinion at this stage the upper side important (see var)  You emphasis the center, but I think a player at your level has difficulties to kill an enemy group in the center.]
;W[do];B[fp];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[I blocked here to give white a small territory on the lower part of the board while giving me thickness above. Would it be wiser to block at r2 instead? If so, why?

rika:
wP3 is not the right approach with black "Chinese Fuseki", black can simply bQ3
reason: it's easy to make a living group by creating a base. Since there is a black stone at bL3 a perfect extention isn't possible (see var.)]
;W[pq]
(;B[qq]C[better bQ4, because you don't need to worry about dangerous cutting points. White will atari your bP4 without hesitation]
;W[pp];B[po];W[np];B[oo];W[mq];B[mo]C[white is more or less settled (wM4 looks painful for black) so probably next best move is bL5 and still the exchange in the upper left]

(;W[no];B[nn];W[lq];B[mp];W[nq];B[lp]TR[mo][lp][mp]SQ[mn][on]
[qo][kp]C[you surely heard of the proverb "4 on the 3rd line die, 6 on the 3rd line live". 5 on the 3rd line AND the right to move first live.  moreover: you just created an empty triangle which means this group has only 3 liberties left (wN4, wN5 has 3 liberties on its own), that's why it's a bad shape on its own (but in certain situation it's powerful, not here)
The cutting points can be very painful as you saw that in the game]
;W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir]C[of course bJ3 is safer (extra cutting point), if white push to J2 white will gain only 1 point at the 1st line (and 1 point at this stage of the game AND is already alive is too small)]
;W[iq];B[hr];W[go]
(;B[gn]C[not very sure if protecting F5 is safer];W[mn]
(;B[mm]C[i believe i could have played differently here but I can't predict the outcome of it.

rika:
yes, that's the result of having too many cutting points. I give L5 a try but outcomes are different (see var)]
;W[ln]
(;B[kp]C[this move doesn't increase the number of liberties (3). I would go to capture J3.]
;W[ip]
(;B[io]C[Perhaps k5 would have been better? I find it hard to see how that would develop though.

rika:
I have added some var (I found out there are too many variations with different outcome)]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jp];B[lm];W[lo];B[jn];W[ho];B[hn];W[hq];B[ke]
SQ[fo]C[still I like the exchange in the upper left I mentioned before; after your move it's natural for white to protect the upper side with everything he has.
F5 cut is dangerous];W[kc];B[id];W[ic]
(;B[gd];W[gc]C[face to face situation... very difficult for me how to play the best. I'm very sure white will use the wedges to dive into the center since black has more to in the center than white at the top.
so connecting e.g. F16]
(;B[df];W[fd];B[fe];W[fc];B[de];W[dd]
(;B[ee]C[natural for beginners to save atari-stone, as you can see wH16  (white next play) has reduced your territory more than that one single stone (see var)]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[he];B[hf];W[ie];B[if];W[je];B[jf];W[jd];B[mf]
C[I don't think saving your territory is the right time now. unsettled: the lower left (F5 for me the most important point, because a connected group give you more points than 2 seperated groups). the left side noone will gain much by playing there first.
upper right: black can surely invade there, but after N14 white will add more stones at the upper right, so a successful invasion will more and more unlikeable]
;W[oe];B[oh];W[cp]
(;B[cj]C[the corner is much more worth then the left side];W[dq]
;B[bj];W[ep];B[ph]C[bF5 still would make a difference about 20 pts.]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[si]C[I wouldn't play bT11 right now because it's gote (a move which the opponent won't answer locally), difference about 6 pts.  better bF5]
;W[bk];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[fo];B[fl]SQ[ad][ak][qr]C[doesn't look like the cut is in danger, so the squared marks is my favorites next plays.]
;W[on];B[nm];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[qr]
(;B[qm]C[I think black can survive this by playing bS2 (difference ~25 pts)]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn];W[qp];B[rm]C[the cut s7 isn't in immediate danger, only after wT5 you have to do something there]
;W[og];B[ng];W[me];B[lf]C[M15 locally 1 pt more];W[nf];B[le]
;W[ld]
(;B[jo]C[gote 1 pt. there are 2 sente moves for black, that are A9 and A15 (see var)]
;W[aj];B[ai];W[ak];B[bh];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[sp];W[sq];B[so]
;W[sh];B[qj]C[lost 1 point];W[kd]C[summary:
losing a game by 50 pts for a beginner is ok, a little bit too much, when I was at 25k I didn't care about counting either. Beginners like me at that time have to learn certain situations of the game, I guess you haven't played 100 19x19 games upto now. Just compare playing Go like learning a foreign language.

Looking at the ending position: white has the whole top and bottom (3 lines each, that makes roughly 120pts).  You need fewer stones to make territory in the corner and at the side.
I hope you know the following board: white has all the 1st and 2nd line, black has the middle 11x11 area. w-b: 136-121
So play simple, 3rd and 4th line is ok, first corner then side.
All stones from the Chinese Fuseki has been captured (sad thing).
In all 4 corners there were no Joseki played out. I think studying some exchange in the corner would help you very much. try: KoGo Joseki Dictionary (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm)
or TurboGo for Windows at www.turbogo.com (you shouldn't play against Computers, because they have behaviours a human shouldn't copy)
Your main weakness I discovered are cutting points which you created
If you are making solid groups, you don't have to worry about cutting points and being captured.
1 pt. move only at the very end of the game (see exchange A15 and A10)
From time to time look at the whole board situation and don't play immediately after opponent's move.
If one of your stones is in atari, pause for a second, and think over, if saving that stone has a big consequence or not.   OK, I hope this will help you a little bit, keep on playing serious games and you will surely promote to 20k if you just keep my advices in mind.
