AB[pd][dp]C[
DA: My summary of this game is that B made a
couple of errors on the left and by the
early middle game had a lost position.

After that there are minor errors in the
yose but they are not crucial.

B Needs to decide which stones
are worth saving. Distinguish between
cutting stones and stones that just
occupy a few points. Look for
your own territory rather than  how to destry your opponent's.

W showed a good feeling for bad shape
and how to punish it. He might have
been a little over-confident about the
group at M3-J3, I think B's best chance
would have come from attacking it.];W[ce];B[ec]C[
DA: Not in my joseki dictionary. Normally D16 if
B doesn't want to play in the corner.

But why play here at all? There's an empty
corner.];W[cc]C[DA: I feel that this is encouraging B to get a high
position. The original 5-3 move was outward
facing so tor consistency  I might try  something such as F15 or D16.]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[de]C[DA: This feels cramped. Perhaps D14 would
get ahead a little? It might leed to a fight if
W cuts but there's no reason to avoid the fight.];W[df];B[ef]
;W[eg]C[
DA: W seems to be doing well here.];B[ff];W[fg]C[DA: This is an appealing point but I'm the sort
of person who worries about the cuts.

So I would play D13.];B[pq]C[
DAThe top does not seem to be resolved,

I would play C6 to reduce the value of
W's thinkness or K16 to make sense
of the B stones];W[po]C[
DA: I'd prefer to play on the left. Perhaps C6?

To me the top left feels unresolved.];B[np];W[qf]C[
DA: This is a little bold. It looks like W wants
to play everywhere.

Leavijg things half finished tends to be
punished later];B[nd]C[DA: Did B consider R10?];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[pj]C[DA: Usually this is considered bad.after S16.

This is because S16/R17 removed the
3-3 invasion. So now you have committed
to stabilising the R14-S16 pair but Q10 is
not connected. R11 is joseki and probably  right. Sometimes Q12 or Q111 are played
but Q10 is too far];B[ch]C[
DA: This is a good idea, but note that the upper
side is not complee. After O16 one  really needs K16 or K17. If you intend
to tenuki then play O17 in the first place.

We now have incomplete positions
on the right and upper side. So this
gets very tricky to play for both sides];W[dg];B[dk]C[M! I felt I hadn't been too clever here. I had nearly had some
white thinkness facing the side, now I suddenly had some white
thickness neutralised by the two Black stones.

DA. I agree that W seems not to have
got as much as he would like.  Hence F13 was probably an overplay.

B though has established a position too close to the
W thickess.

I would be inclined to play D9 at C7. W
would then find it difficult to extinguish the C12  stone and ends up with no good way
of using his thickness.];W[iq];B[fq]C[A: I think I played on the wrong side. Would M3 or L3 have been
better?


DA: I think so. Partly because the flow of
W at 3, B E3, W F4 will lead B to play where
he wants which is somwhere on the left  such as C7. But also because you can then
happily Play Q 7.];W[lq];B[mr]C[DA: This feels cramped and cofirms that
F3 was probably bad.];W[cn]C[DA: a reasonable idea but W needs to
worry about the weaknesses he's leaviing.];B[en]C[DA: Too vague. Doesn't really attack W and
dosn't really connect D9.

I'd play B2 to stablie one group and then hope
to chase W out and attack one of his two groups.];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[cj]C[M! I've decided it's my job as White to create some complications
so I'll try to alternate White and Black down the side and connect
something to something.


DA: this is how I play in a high handicap game.
Here it smacks of not really having a plan.
As it happens B goies badly wrong, but
W did not *make* it happen.];B[di]C[A: I think I committed my usual error of trying to save all my
stones. It might have been better to sacrifice the C12 stone
and play C9 instead of D11?


DA: Yes this is the key moment of the
game. You say you make this error often?
Then you must try to find a way ofn thinking
 to avoid it.   The problems with D11 are:

1). W has 7 stoing stones. So:

a). You will never attack them.
b).  "Play away from thickness"

2). Suppose W got a wall up along the 10 the line
and you get a correspondng one alond the
9th. He will get about 20 points for an investment
of 10 stones. And NO potential to grow.,This is a rotten return. You could easilyg et that many points
of the left with more potential at the top. So
youn want him tom spend stones capturing  C12.

3). Stones worth saving are nusually cutting
stones. Cutting stones are useful if thay
cut off weak stones.

So play C9 and with any luck you get sente.];W[dj];B[fi]C[DA: very dodgy to jump so close to a wall.
How confident are you about dealing with
E 11?];W[ej];B[ei];W[bh]C[M! I'm not sure at this point whether I can connect the middle
to the top or not but the great advantage of the white group
at the top is I feel it's pretty safe

DA: Hmm this is a bit suspect. What about
B C13 making miai of B13 and C14?

I'd be think about mves around C8];B[bi]C[DA: This seems like a very bad mistake.]
;W[ci]C[DA: I can't see an answer to this.];B[dh];W[bg]C[M! This is good, I now have a nice Black group to chase.

DA: Yes this makes the game very difficult for B.
What's more the left side is devastated,

However notre that the 5 black stones are not
very valuable. They do not separate W and
so could be given up even now];B[ck]C[A: Here I go again adding to a sacrifice when I need to play
F10 and H11!
I think I was trying to surround c6.

DA. Yes this seems off the point. Conceivably
B might get 12 points in gote with this move.

Of your alternatives the one I like bast is H11.
I'm not sure whether it works! But you
might be able to follow up by P12 and K16
and make a substantial mojo.];W[bk]C[
DA: From this point on the tactics become
very tricky to calculate. I was thinking
W B10 was better because it left better
corner aji, but the game shows that
there was plenty aji anyway.

On a "hane at the head of two stones"
principla this is good.

B should note how C9 was played very
closely to the W wall and hence was  always likely to be in trouble. As a  rule making territory this close to strength
is unlikely to work.];B[bl];W[bj];B[cm]C[

DA: natural, I thought at first B had done
remarkably well. I don't see a good alternative,
and that suggests that C9 was bad.];W[dm]C[
DA Ouch Now if this works B gets very upset.
Given the shape here it's worth a try.];B[ek]C[
DA:  B needs to have a clear objective
in mind. He now realises that B7  threatens to connect and should be aware of
the corner aji. He's not going to get miuch  territory here so he *must* avoid being shut in.
A long term goal is to follow N2 and attack M3 and J3];W[fj]
;B[gi]C[DA: No!!! These stones have no meaning let them  go.

E7 is the best I can see.];W[fk]C[DA. Now B cannot hoe for a good result.
It should be obvious that E8 is coming.
Best B can do is submit at B2.

W is doing very nicely.];B[em]C[DA: If B sees B2 as a possibility then
he can't play this move];W[bo]C[M! I was pleased with this double-purpose move: either I connect
to the corner or I catch the five Black stones just above.

DA: yes this seems like a very neat move.
W has exploited his extra move (because of
H11)  in this  area very nicely.];B[bp]C[DA: Concedes the entire side, but bat least
thye corner is safe.];W[el];B[fl]C[DA: B wastes ko threats.

At this point B needs to tae a deep breath
and think of a way to win the game.

I would go after the two stones at the bottom.];W[dl];B[cl]
C[DA: Feels like a rush of blood to the head.

At time like this you need to make yourself
read it out.];W[dn];B[bn];W[an];B[co];W[bm];B[do];W[al]C[A: what can I say


DA. B has actually weakend his wall by
reducing its liberties.];B[dq]C[
DA: If this was necessary B should just resign.
To give up the left side in gote is too bad.];W[gn]C[DA: has the feel of an overplay.
W should now win but has two
prblems, the weak stones at the
boittom and the mojo at the top.

This move migh help the two stones
But In reckon M5 is better.];B[gm];W[hk];B[hm];W[hg]C[DA: Very nice. B needs a move on the
upper side urgently, But those two  white stones at the bottom are under threat]
;B[gj]C[DA: B has a real problem in giving
up stones!];W[gk];B[ii];W[jl];B[hn];W[jg]C[M! I am happy to be chasing this black group across the middle
and buildig a wall facing into what was going to be Black's territory
in the top. At this point I expected to kill the Black group
but once again Alan wriggled out. I wonder what I should have
done to kill it.


DA: You don't need to kill it. In fact the
best thing you can do it keep on not killing
it It has already given you free moves on
the left and at H13, K13 and K8. This game
is already over. B has gained precisely 0
points from 9 moves. Wriggling out and
living withy 2 points is of no purpose.
B should be looking to build territory. He  can't now.];B[jn]
C[DA: Good move W needs to be careful now.];W[lo];B[of]C[DA: How about O6?]
;W[nn]C[DA: Yes W's week group is helper a lot by this];B[ph]
C[DA: Usually bad. R12 would be
more intesting. B needs to make
something dramatic hapen.];W[qh];B[gg]C[DA: B is going to suffer huge losses somewhere
by making W strong.];W[gf];B[gh];W[ge]C[DA: B's only chance now is to attack hese two
stones. There is a small chance that B could
take the entire upper side. But he must look after the
cutting stones F26 is a must];B[hf];W[ig];B[ik];W[il];B[jk]
;W[kl]C[M! I deliberated for a while as to whether I could play this
one point higher at L9.

DA: Your're winning. keep it simple. This
is fine.];B[hj];W[ji];B[kk];W[lk];B[ki];W[lj];B[jh];W[kh];B[li]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[ng];B[mg];W[lf];B[ih];W[jj];B[kj]
;W[hh];B[ij];W[ie]C[A; with one eye I desparately tried to get another and in doing
so lost track of the territory at the top.


DA: Yes. But that was ineviatble.

You need to undestand that this wasn't
because you "lost track" it was because
that's how go works! You're playing
on the inside so W is playing on the outside
and so get's strength and so can use it
to do damage.

You needed to give up those stones
a long time ago.];B[ni];W[pg];B[nf];W[mf];B[og];W[pi];B[oh]
;W[gc];B[ll]C[A: I should still have tried to secure the top but a glaze came
over my eyes having got the second eye I tried to kill more.
The top is crying out for urgent action

DA: I don't understand this comment.
The middle of the top is under debate but
the bottom right seems larger and
more undecided.];W[ml];B[lm];W[nk];B[hl];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]
;W[os]C[M! Idly probing for a sensitive spot. That wasn't it.]
;B[or];W[mq];B[lr];W[kr];B[nq];W[gr];B[kq];W[jq]C[M! I was pleased with this move which which enables me to play
L5 and rescue the three White stones in the middle.


DA: Only if B cares about this one stone ;-)];B[kp];W[ko];B[lp]
;W[km]C[DA: what happens now If B plays K5?
How confident are you that W can live?];B[mn]C[DA: another little error]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[jo];B[ho];W[io]C[DA: B should count the game at this point.
It should be clear that W is miles ahead.
It's better to resign and play another game
han eek out the yose.

Having a rough estimate of the score  is important.];B[fr];W[ld]
;B[sp]C[M! Indeed! Could have been worse, could have been a monkey jump
at T5.];W[rn];B[gq];W[hr];B[hq]C[DA: Very small and gote.];W[mb]
C[M! I was a bit surprised to be allowed to get this, along with
the earlier G17 and M16 in. It was ultimately worth quite a lot
especially as I capture the Black stones in the top left.


DA: this is indeed very large. It's worth
noting how costly B's small gote move was.];B[mc];W[lc];B[nb]
;W[md];B[nc];W[rc];B[pf];W[qg];B[rb]C[M! Yes, I wish I'd played this.

DA: Pretty much B's privilege.
From here on the yose is normal];W[qd];B[pb];W[nj];B[no];W[on]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[lb];W[kb];B[la];W[ka];B[ma];W[jc]C[M! I deliberated over whether I needed to do this but couldn't
bear the thought of being wrong. I was pretty sure I had won
this and didn't want to throw it away.];B[kn];W[ln];B[in];W[sb]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[bq];W[gl];B[fm];W[rq]

;B[ne];W[oi];B[lg];W[kg];B[rp];W[qo];B[cg];W[cf];B[cb];W[bb]
;B[ib]C[A: i think I stretched too far better might have been G18?

DA: In see no chance at all of 2 eyes here];W[gb];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[fe];W[dc];B[db];W[fc];B[fb];W[fa];B[eb];W[ca];B[ba]C[M! Nearly a nasty surprise.

DA: I don't see it. There's no
space for a second eye.];W[aa];B[da];W[bc];B[ra];W[sc])
