C[
Hello,

I want to know why I lost this game and how to improve my game. Also, I would be grateful  if mistakes are pointed out. I played black, and my current rank is 12k.

Thank You

Teemu Leppanen (teemu.leppanen@oulu.fi)];B[pd]C[I play chinese opening when I'm black because I have studied a book about it.

You know more about this than opening than I do, since I haven't read any books about it.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[qf];B[nd]C[To get some area. This move is consistent with the opening. Maybe I should have played
pincer because stone 4-4 means influence, perhaps it is better to make area from the 3-4
stone?

I think this is fine];W[rd];B[qc]C[I dont know if this is passive since there are bigger moves, but because I started to make area
I played this.];W[qi];B[cn]C[Consistent with the opening.];W[co]
C[I know this is a bit sloppy move. How should I take advantage of it?

I think D6 takes advantage of this.  However, it's not a bad move on White's part; there's not much to take advantage of.  It's only a bit sloppy in the context of the entire board, not in the local situation.  The problem is it allows you to claim a large space on the left side.]
;B[ck]C[Another possibility would have d6, but I dont like that move because white plays next somewhere this move. Problem here is that white can play d6.

D6 is the better move.  You have to be bold, and not be afraid of losing the C6-D6 group.  This move is too timid, I think.  You should let white play around c9 and then counter squeeze white.  This will let you build up a big area.]
;W[gp];B[lq]C[Instead of this move, is it possible to play c3 to "punish" white? I dont like this move, because it seems to give white good development. What should I do instead of this??  Maybe make my own stones stronger in the  upper left corner (e17 or e16?) and when  white invades, make area by chasing him??

I don't think C3 is a good move here.  You have many options, and I don't think this (M3) is a bad move.    E17 or E16 would also be good moves.  M4 might be good, or O3, or I even like K10.]
;W[nq];B[iq];W[gq];B[mp]C[This is sloppy move. Better would have j5??

I agree this is sloppy.  I'm not sure what is best.  J5 is probably better than this.  N2 is another possibility, as is N5 or M5 or, if you want to be bold, R3.]
;W[bo]C[This was ood move from white?? Now I should invade the lower right corner.

This makes your left side look a little weak. but an invasion on the lower right is indeed possible.]
;B[bn]C[This is not a bad move, but now C9 is too close to your wall.]
;W[qm];B[qq]C[good];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[oo]
C[I dont know if I would have been able to live there if white have not played this move. Of course I can cause trouble by playing r5.]
;B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[so]C[This is a bad move by White.  Better would have been T4 but best would be elsewhere, such as J16, C14, D6, or some such]
;B[sp]C[I think I needed not to answer white this move. Anyway now the corner seems safe. S1 was
better as shown later.

I also think this move was unneeded.  You should have moved elsewhere, perhaps at E18 or E18 or K10 or E6 or J5]
;W[io]C[I wish it was my stone in that point. But when I can play d6 this seems not too bad.
Of course now white can play inside my stones.];B[hr]C[Make eyes, and when white answers move to the center.]
;W[gr];B[mn]C[I think it is better to protect your eye space more.  Maybe N2 would be a good first move.  That would make use of your now very strong corner stones.  Another option would be K4, which has more influence on the center.]
;W[jr]C[I don't think you can kill this white stone.  So best not to try.]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[lr]C[This move should be at L3 since you can't kill the white stones.]
;W[ir]
(;B[kq]C[Just trying to keep my stones connected. Any better ideas??

You could play at H3 and save a couple stones, at the expense of a little less eye space when you're done.  It would probably be worth it.  See the variation.]
;W[hq];B[jo];W[hn]C[ This was weird move from white.];B[jn]
C[This is of course the answer.];W[ec];B[df]C[Make area. Is d17 possible and when white runs to the center play this move??

I think both d17 and this are possible.  I also like E16 to build a wall to make territory on the left side.  Another option is D15, which is also joseki.]
;W[ee];B[de]C[Instead of this take the corner with d17 or c17??

Yes.  Deny white eye space and make white run.];W[gc];B[ie]
C[Makes moyo.];W[gf];B[ld]C[The corner is more important.  Your stones J17 and J15 are strong enough.  This is too many stones in this area.   H18 would be better than this move, as well as M15 or N14; but best is D18, I think.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[di]C[Is there something better??
I like this one.  But now you are behind, I think.];W[ac];B[ad]
;W[ab]C[White played very small here. It is weird, even when white plays small moveslike this   he still wins.

Agreed, white played small];B[dn]C[To make white area smaller.

This is a timid move.  You should at least move to E6 here.  But S17 is more important, I think.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[qb];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[og]
C[Enlarge my moyo and make whites area smaller.

Fine.];W[oi];B[nm]C[Any better reductive moves?? Im aiming at q6.

I like this move];W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[pn];W[qn];B[mh]C[Enlarge my moyo.]
;W[jl];B[im];W[mk];B[km]C[I was bit afraid of not getting two eyes.

This was too timid.  Instead, a move like J8 threatens and extends; or perhaps H7.  M8 is also possible.]
;W[gm];B[do];W[cq];B[jh]C[Is this too passive??];W[kc];B[kd]
C[What should I do here?? This seemed somehow natural.

When trying to kill an invading stone it is usually best to not play in contact.  Conversely, when trying to live, it is usually best to play in contact.  It would be better to play H18 and let white try to live inside, which is a hard job.  Another possibility would be K18, but that it is probably too timid.]
;W[ib];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ka];B[lb]C[I though this was the easiest way. This was very good for white. I hope I could have played h18 earlier. Maybe this was the losing sequence??

The problem was earlier, with L18.  This move here is not bad.]
;W[hb];B[ph]C[Reduction. Small move??

not bad.  Definitely sente.];W[qh];B[pi];W[pj];B[en]C[I am trying to make wall. Now this move seems funny. I was afraid of being cut from d6 if I have played e5.

This is a very bad move.    First playing E4 and then this move would be better, sacrificing one stone.  E5 is possible but also ugly.  F5 works, as does E8 or maybe F8, but I like E4 first best.]
;W[ep]C[Of course white answers this and now I make area.];B[fl]
;W[jg]C[Big reduction from white. I wasnt aware that this move is possible.

I would have fought this with J13 or J12.];B[kg]C[Maybe instead j13??]
;W[ig];B[kf];W[lh];B[lg];W[li];B[kh];W[hh];B[ef];W[fe];B[fg]
C[Making profit.];W[pf];B[of];W[nh];B[ng];W[mi];B[mg]C[This is too small.]
;W[ek]C[Another reduction. I should have played this instead of f8.

No, the problem is your response.  White is getting away with invasions you should be able to capture.  You should be able to capture this with F9.]
;B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[fm];B[fk];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[fi];W[dh]
;B[ci]C[This is a bad move.  Instead, you should play at E12 and capture.]
;W[fh];B[eg]C[Instead, play at G12 and  I think you might still win.  Try and avoid these empty triangles.]
;W[eh];B[gh]C[I was running out of liberties.

This is useless.  Try to save your stones now.];W[gi]C[Here I made big mistake. This was more that ten points.]
;B[gg];W[gj];B[ch];W[gl];B[kl];W[kk];B[nl];W[nk];B[il];W[ik]
;B[hg];W[ih];B[hf];W[ii];B[ao];W[bp];B[ap]C[There were bigger moves. Another mistake.]

;W[op];B[no];W[ns];B[os]C[This is not so good.  You could play S1 now.]
;W[qs]C[I should have seen this before and played s1 instead last move.]
;B[pr];W[rr];B[sr]C[White made ko-fight here. Luckily he did answer my moves, even when they were not ko threads!]

;B[sa];W[ki];B[jj];W[ra];B[fb]C[This is not a ko threat.];W[fc]
;B[sa];W[lo]C[This is not a ko threat.  Either N6 or L5 makes eyes.]
;B[ln];W[ra];B[oc]C[This was unnecessay.];W[sa];B[tt];W[tt]
;B[tt]C[
 pauno dead @ L17
 etsu dead @ R13
 pauno dead @ M5
 etsu dead @ F18
 etsu dead @ B2
 etsu done];C[White won by 16.5 points.

In general, I think your big problem is that you let white get away with invasions that should not work.  But you are better than white at avoiding small moves.  If you had not lost the fight over the stones at E12, you would have won nicely.]
