AB[pd][dp]C[Thanks for reviewing my game. I'm johi, playing black. I've been playing for a couple of months and would appreciate any general feedback on what I most need to improve.

I made at least a couple of bad mistakes in this game. I left the top right undefended early on (which white took advantage of around move 113) and I lost a group of stones which should have been safe around move 175.

I would like to know how I should have played in the top right early on ... what would have been the best way to secure that corner? As well as any general comments on the game.

Thanks a lot, Jo

Hello, I'm Thorre, playing around 9k in Germany and I'm your reviewer for today. I marked my comments, so you should be are able to identify them.

Check out variation 2. Here are some examples of good shape.]

(;B[cd];W[qf]
(;B[pf]LB[qe:A]C[johi: would this have been better at R15?

THO: The marked move is okay, it starts a common joseki. Look at the possible continuation (it starts from 6. move).

A move at R15 (marked with A) is possible too. Check this variation.

So if you want to choose a joseki-move you have too anticipate the rough patterns that will follow. Both ways of playing could be successful if they fit your whole board strategy.]
;W[pg];B[of]
(;W[pj]LB[qd:A][qe:B][re:C]C[THO: This move seems unusual. Common joseki start with A,B or C - at least to get a piece of corner...]

(;B[nq]LB[md:B][qe:A]C[johi: I guess I should have defended at the top here, insteading of this. Would N16 have been ok?

THO: For securing the corner against the white forces from below you could play at A. 

If you play at N16 (marked as B) look at the possible continuation. Your position seems a little bit overconcentrated now.]
;W[lq]
(;B[jp]LB[no:A][qq:B]C[Would this have been better at K3??

THO: The marked move seems unusual. At this point you should check 2 main possibilities. If you want to go out take A. If you want to get the corner take B.

Check both variations.];W[jq]LB[lo:A][mo:B][mp:C]C[THO: This move seems questionable. Why not force black to defend with A, B or C?]

;B[po]LB[ed:B][jd:A][cj:C]C[THO: At this point you could think about three main questions that will help to decide the next move:

1. Defense: Is there a group of your forces at the the board that will need a defensive move? If your group is in acute danger your move should be a defensive move.

At the moment there is no need to defend your P4 group. There is no group of your forces in acute danger.

2. Attack: Is there any weakness at your opponent´s groups that you could exploit by attacking? 

Yes, there are some weak points at your opponent´s positions and you could attack them. But for the time being it seems to me there are no really big profitable targets to attack. So:

3. Big Moves: Check the board and look at the biggest open fields. Play in these fields. 

At the moment it seems to me, that positions around A, B and C are very big points to play. 

I think they are better than Q5.];W[qq];B[pp];W[qr];B[pr];W[ps]

[nq][pq][nr][pr][os]C[THO: The power of the marked stones isnt very useful, cause their thickness is erased by the three white stones around L4.]
;B[ko];W[ip];B[jo];W[hp];B[lp];W[kq]
(;B[ec]LB[fc:A]C[THO: The marked stone seems to close. I think you could play at A. Check possible continuation.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[cj];B[ch];W[dl];B[dn]LB[jd:A]C[This seems like a bad move. How would K16 have been here?

THO: Indeed, a play around A seems bigger. But then your corner group around D4 could get under attack. So your move seems okay to me.]

C[THO: Think about the "Three Magic Questions"... Even if you dont want to attack the week white D8 group you should now play around A. It is a really big point!]
;W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[jn]LB[jd:A]C[THO: Again, you should play around A.]

(;B[fh]LB[dh:A]C[THO: A play around A is solid and seems better than the marked stone.]

;W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[ce];W[cg];B[ff];W[fi];B[eg];W[gh];B[ji]

(;W[nd]CR[lo]LB[id:C][ld:B][qe:A]C[I realise I should have played here much earlier. But even so, is there a better way I could have played to minimise the damage? Would I have been better playing to the left of the white stone?

THO: You could try to stabilize your corner position by attacking the white group below with a move like A. 

Then, if your corner group is a little bit stronger, you could press the marked white stone against your thickness with a move like B and then secure territory with C.

BUT: 
Keep in mind that your H9 group isnt very strong. You should try to connect this group with your thick group below or with your corner group.

Note further that your stones around K5 are lost, if white ataris at M5 (circled). So you should look for a chance to defend them.]

THO: There is no really good answer, I think. You could puzzle a little bit to check out a continuation that saves the most points for your Q4 group, but  there is not very much to get here.]
