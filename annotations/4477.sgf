C[ -- I will denote my comments with the double dash like so.
Your question was "How should I have proceeded to keep Black from developing so strong on the left?"
Let me take some time to mention that people stronger than me will surely be able to see my mistakes very easily, and my moves are not the best by any means, but I can offer some of my own feelings on certain moves and variations.  Think about them for yourself and see if they make sense to you.  If not, ask me or someone else to see if they agree.  Learning is about thinking critically and incorporating new ideas.  So at the very least I should be able to offer up new ideas for you to think about and accept or reject.  Thanks!

;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[eb]LB[jd:A]C[Moving to A would have better secured White's position here.  The given move simply opens White to a Black invasion around A.
 -- This is correct, plus it is makes white heavy, try to play light. (i.e. keep your stones possible to sacrifice, and covering as much ground as efficiently as possible)]
;W[fb];B[eg];W[jd];B[he]LB[hc:A][hd:B]C[ -- If Black has no base, try to push him away from thickness or strength.  Check variations.  In this case, contact is probably okay, but in general I would always consider some more alternatives first.]

(;W[hc]C[The contact move in the variation is, I think, stronger as Black'c cuts at G16 and J16 are not particularly bothersome.  As it is White set the stage for further reduction moves by Black.
-- It appears that way, but contact fights can easily get out of hand and messy.  Better to try to maintain control. (See variations)]

[qg:B][kh:C][ph:A]C[Too timid.  A direct contact move at A or B would have been stronger.  Also, as White's moyo needs expanding a move around C or D would have influenced more territory and put further pressure on Black's Q13 stone.]

How has your summer been?  Mostly hot and sticky over here.

Later,

riad: No, that's probably it. The bottom right might still need reinforcing (BO1, WN2, BR2, WR3, BP2, WQ2, BQ1...), but we can leave that I think?

Is my opponent correct about the lower right?

White: 59 territories + 0 prisoner + 6.5 komi = 65.5
Black: 130 territories + 9 prisoners = 139
Result: B+73.5

-- I would assume there is not much black can do in the bottom right.  There are many comments that look good in the middle of the game and variations.  The ones that needed some work I added to.  Also, about learning not to fear cutting points.  Practice making mistakes.  No one will remember those games they played with you back when you were 20 kyu level.  That's where you learn to see what is possible and what is not possible. Make bold moves and see if they cause destruction.  Often times you'll be surprised to find that they don't.  If they do, learn how to minimize damage, and it will carry over to smaller mistakes.]
