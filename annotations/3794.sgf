C[
rakdver: I lost this game by a fairly large amount (30 pts).  Still, nothing went dramatically wrong.  Till some moment, I felt just fine, I was quite a bit ahead on points, and I thought I will be able to prevent white from catching up on me.
prana: Black showed good fighting spirit in this game. But white succeeded with his solid and calm play.]

C[rak: I should have probably played e3 next
prana: yes, e3 seems to be normal. Works fine together with c6.]

(;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[fr];W[cq]C[rak:I considered ignoring this and playing around k4, but the white group has quite bad shape and I wanted to keep it week.
prana: b d2 is a strong move:
First, as you say, it keeps more initiative.
Second, it is big, because of the endgame at b3.];B[dr];W[iq]

(;B[go];W[fn]TR[go]C[prana: try to avoid pushing your opponent from behind. The exchange is good for w.]
;B[hq];W[kq];B[ip];W[jp];B[ir];W[jq]C[rak: Now I wanted to attack d4 group, and hopefuly get a stone around d10 in sente.  It did not quite work (39 is bad idea).

Perhaps I should have just taken a big point on right.

prana: I agree. Playing around q10 is big and easy.
Attacking d4 is too early. At the moment, this group isn't weak at all.
(especially after the exchange b g5, w f6)];B[co];W[cp]C[prana: c5 is aji keshi. Now, b b3 doesn't work anymore. 
Furthermore, c6 is heavy now.];B[bn];W[ck];B[dl];W[dj];B[fl]

(;B[hp]C[prana: j4 is not important. Better try something else.]
;W[im];B[hn]C[prana: This doesn't work, it helps only w.
Unfortunately, you are forcing w now, to make moves he wanted to make anyway.]

(;W[jl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fk]C[prana: w was very nice to give you the connection (keeps you in the game).]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[ef];B[fh]C[prana: overplay. w is strong in this region. No reason to fight here.]
;W[eh];B[gi];W[gh];B[qn];W[ql];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[rp]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[rn]C[rak: Continuing with o3 seems a bit small to me, so I decided to let w enclose me in the corner, and take the extension from both positions.
prana: No, o3 is a big move. Gives you profit, and keeps the aji of r6.]

(;B[qh];W[oq]C[prana: big and sente.];B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[mc]
C[rak: I now have some 25 points of territory, + I should be able to get at least 15 points in upper right.  W has almost no sure territory, but a lot of potential. So I decided not to hurry and just to reinforce what I have.
prana: w has around 30 points territory in the lower right and around 20 points in the upper region. I think he is slightly ahead in territory.]

(;B[oe]C[ch: too slow. Try to reduce the white mojo now.];W[qj]

;B[hb];W[kb];B[ia];W[lb];B[fb];W[qf]C[rak: W center is now becoming big.  I perhaps should have done something about it now (like P13, and if he tries to save  r14, just do something and jump to say n9)?
prana: trying to reduce the w mojo is a good idea, but w is very thick, so it is not easy to do. You could play around N9 as a probe.]

(;B[ph];W[of];B[pf];W[pe];B[pg];W[od];B[qe];W[ne]C[rak: 115 was stupid.  I just push white on 9th line, making it harder to make n6 area smaller.  Probably something like n9 or n10 now?
prana: 115 looks normal to me. w is very thick in the lower part, so it will be difficult to reduce. But since you are behind, you also can try n9.]
;B[pj];W[ri]
(;B[rh]C[prana: why this? This is very small. Only yose.];W[pk]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[mk];W[ok]C[prana: after n9, you should continue playing light. 
(Of course there is some risk in doing so)]
(;B[nj];W[mj]C[prana: bad shape for b. p10 is heavy, n9 almost lost.]
;B[lj];W[mi]C[rak: I hoped to be able to get in now by sacrificing n9, but it of course does not work.]

(;B[jj];W[lk];B[kk];W[ll];B[kl];W[km]C[rak: I now have some 40 points of territory, and not much chance to get significantly more. The next move is almost pass, I should have played q16.  With it, I would have some 50 pts.

n6 area is almost 40 pts for white, plus komi, plus say 8 pts on the rest of the board, + potential in center. After he plays q17, I have only 45 pts, W gained some 6 more pts, and very little potential to get more, so I have basically lost.

prana: q16 is huge...]
(;B[jk]C[prana: ...and k9 is very small.];W[pc]C[prana: game over. My commentary ends here.]
