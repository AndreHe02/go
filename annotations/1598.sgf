C[Game played on IGS on 02 may 2003, the clock was set to 10/10. I was white, and I don't really know where I lost the game.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[pc];W[do];B[fp]LB[dq:A][cq:B]C[stef : I think this was a mistake from black.

A is the normal approach, while B gives white a lot of influence, so is rather played when the top is not going to easily become a big moyo.

But I don't think that black loses too much aiming for simplicity.]
;W[dq];B[jp];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc];B[qc];W[pf];B[qg]
;W[oh]LB[nd:A][oh:B]C[Connecting at A is more usual. Jumping at B would make sense in a radically center oriented strategy, but here a black invasion at the top makes the wall rather useless.]
;B[id];W[ec]C[This move seems bad, not only it does not apply pressure to the invading stone, the "wall" is weaker than it seems and black will settle there too easily.]
;B[mc]LB[nc:A][ne:B]C[A and B are other less peacefull possibilities for black here.]
;W[kc]LB[ob:A][ne:B]C[stef : Most of the time, cutting a 3 point jump turns out bad for me ...

Because of the connection at A and the easy escape to the center for the J16 stone, the invasion here feels bad. But is hard to find a good move for white ... maybe just reinforce at B, hope that black will reinforce at the top and then be the first to play at the left.]
;B[kd]
(;W[ld]LB[jd:A][jc:B]C[This hane is 99 % of the time bad, after black cuts white is usually left in an inferior position.

A or B are the standard followups. look the variations.];B[lc]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[jc];B[je];W[ic];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[gc];B[dj]
LB[me:A]C[Capturing at A seems safer for black, and the white stones are under pressure, so black maybe can be the first to play at the left side anyway.]
;W[me];B[ob];W[qi]LB[qh:A][qf:B][rg:C]TR[oh]C[The standard move is A, that threatens to wedge at B and cut and maybe capture the black stone, so it's ususally answered with black C, beeing sente.
That's why the white marked keima is usually answered at A by black: better the keima beeing sente than allow A in sente later.]
;B[cm];W[qn];B[nq]
(;W[on]LB[hp:A][co:B]C[This is of course big, but letting black get the initiative at the left is also big. Because of the invading possibilities at A if the corner is stronger, I would play at B, see variations.]
;B[cp];W[dp];B[co];W[fr];B[gr];W[fq];B[gq];W[cq];B[cg];W[rp]
;B[qq]C[stef : At this stage, a quick estimation made me felt 10-15 points behind, and I had less influence in the center. I didn't know what to do next, and finally decided to attack the baseless stones at the top.

White territory is easy to count: 
24 at top, 8 at lower left, 20 at right beeing generous 
= 52 + komi + sente

Black is not so easy:
20 at left, 24 at bottom, 15 at upper right = 59 + influence

Black has much more influence into the center, so either the bottom or the left side can grow easily, while the "weak group" is not really very weak cause it can scape easily.]
;W[ff]LB[hf:A]TR[jd]C[A is the key point to attack the black stones there, it's both the central point point in front of the 3 stones an it combines with the marked stone to make a false eye in the connecting point.]
;B[hf];W[fd]LB[hh:A][gp:B]C[Too slow. Although a safe move, black can now settle the group and the attack is over.

I think that white's hope is to continue to pressure black with A, and gain some kind of stable position in the center so black can't aim for a big moyo. Then either expand the right or invade at the bottom, maybe cutting at B instead depending on how the center ends.]
;B[mf];W[ne];B[le];W[md];B[nf];W[of];B[fg]C[The attack is a complete failure now: black has just increased it's influence.]
;W[mo]C[This keima is risky, black can cut it and try to fight. Even if the white stone survives, the right side territory can get damaged.]
;B[lp];W[lh]C[Again too loose, black can figth back, but there are even simple measures. See variation.]

(;B[mk];W[ok];B[mi];W[fn];B[mh];W[eg];B[ef]LB[fh:A]C[Bad, just A is better, now white can enter.]
;W[gg];B[fh];W[gf];B[ee];W[fe];B[ce];W[lf];B[nh]LB[jh:A]C[Strange, A seems the key point in the central figth.]
;W[jh];B[jg];W[kg]TR[ce][nh]C[stef : I was happy to capture a few stones, but this didn't change the outcome.

12 move before I would say capturing was impossible !
but the mistake then with the crosscut and  the slow marked moves made it happen.
But both moves, specially the one at the left had big followups that make up for some of the points lost in the center.]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[pj];W[qk]C[It's usually bad to leave this gap.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[pk];W[ql];B[jj];W[ih];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc]LB[rq:A]
[rh:B]C[stef : Here again I didn'tknow what to do next ... I finally decided to try making a few points in the center.

There's no way to make points in the center, black has more thickness here !

A and B are probably the biggest points, if you are sure to be able to reduce black's center prospects.]

[sr:B][gs:C]C[This is big, about 6+ points, but is gote.
A, B or C are maybe smaller, but do threaten far more than 6 points each, so you can play all of them now in a row and black won't have time to protect the 3 stones.]

;W[sr];B[qr];W[hk]LB[gs:A][bb:B][bp:C]TR[ii]C[Small, there 2 points to reduce here, the marked ones, so black is not going to get much. First A in sente, then  B or C is better.]

LB[hj:A]C[stef : This is a new concept : a gote ko threat :-P

well, the ko itself looks rather pointless to me anyway ...

;B[nc];W[lb];B[od];W[pi];B[il]LB[mb:A]C[A is enormous: if black plays there gets 4 more points while white loses at least 2, and there's another capture hanging worth about 6 more points, while if white plays here saves the 6 points, plus the next possible 6 while threatening to capture 5 stones ....
I don't think that there are so many points hanging on the ko]
