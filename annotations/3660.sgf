C[Hi, I am Fabiano, playing with Black. This game I did played on IGS (September 25, 2005).

Komi: 0,5

Comments by Erwin Bruinsma (nickname on KGS is flipper), 3k in the Netherlands]
;B[pd]C[Some remarks about looking at a game:
-try to estimate the points you and your opponent are making (balance of territory)
-look at thickness (balance of thickness)
-look at strong and weak groups
Keep an eye on these three things during the whole game.

One of the most important things about the fuseki is to try to avoid weak groups!]
;W[cp];B[pq];W[cd];B[eq]C[Probably better to play E4 (high approach)]
;W[eo];B[gp]C[This move seem wrong...];W[kq]
(;B[qo]C[This move doesn't really attack the white stone. 
White is playing an invasion, so he has to run or make eyes. 
Your move is not destroying eyespace or attacking the stone.]
;W[hq]C[White is happy now.
The black group and the white stones didn't have enough eyespace before this move. 
White is making a base and some eyespace. At the same time he is attacking black; it will be very hard for black to make two eyes at the side now.]
;B[fp]C[This move is making an connection, but doesn't put pressure on the white stones. 
G3 is defending the cut and puts more pressure on the white stones.
G3 also contributes also a little to eyeshape for black.];W[cq]
C[This move takes the corner 
This move destroys potential eyespace for black, the black group becomes weak.]
;B[cj]C[The three black stones are not strong enough to survive on there one. They will come under attack sooner of later.]
;W[cl];B[cg]C[Making a base is important (avoiding weak groups). Good move.]
;W[em];B[jp];W[jq];B[hp]C[Black can be happy with the fact that white isn't splitting the black stones.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[iq]C[The black group is still weak.];B[qj];W[lp]
;B[ed]C[... and this is dubious.

It is possible.];W[de]C[This is a good white move.
It seperates the E16 and C 13 stone.];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[be]
;B[dl]C[This is dubious! It doesn't really make the black group stronger.
It is better to make the group stronger by going to the center.]
;W[dm];B[ck];W[bl]C[This move makes the black group really weaker!]
;B[eh];W[ee];B[hc]C[Very good move.];W[ff]
(;B[pc]C[too slow... where i play to get the corner?

see variation, move 38];W[bb];B[jo];W[ln];B[cn]C[You are wanting too much now.

Priority for black is the weak group on the lower side, it doesn't have eyes.
The group at the left side is also not very strong.

Weak groups have always top priority! Either to defend your one or to attack your opponents.]
;W[bn];B[do];W[dp];B[ep];W[dn];B[fo];W[en];B[hl]C[Good move. 

Makes the weak group at the lower side stronger.];W[fk]C[Good move. 

Seperates the both black groups.];B[gh];W[dk]C[H10 is important

Seperate the both groups, attacking two groups with one move is always nice.]
;B[dj];W[ek];B[bk];W[bh];B[bg];W[dg];B[dh];W[bf];B[ag];W[bi]
;B[ch];W[ej];B[eg];W[df];B[gg];W[he];B[jd]C[Good move];W[md]
;B[lc]C[White N16 is invading black moyo, how black can protect your own moyo?

A moyo is NOT territory!
So there is always a chance that your opponent comes in.
It isn't bad for you, as you opponent comes in. As long as you get something back!
E.g. secure territory on the right side.];W[mc];B[qg]C[This is a good move, you try to secure territory on the right side.
Maybe R14 is a little bit better.];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[ic];W[fd]
;B[fc];W[ge];B[gb];W[gd];B[eb]C[It is good, to keep your stones connected!]
;W[ld];B[kc];W[qh]C[Mistake.

White has three weak stones at the top. He cann't afford to have an other weak group. 
Black must seperate R12 and N16 group, see also variation.]

(;B[rh];W[rg]
(;B[ri]C[this... i did played very wrong... where is better?

S11 is a mistake, see variation move 88.

R13 is more important for black than S12, so you have to save that stone.
R13 is the stone that seperates R12 and S13 from N16!];W[qf]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[re];W[rf];B[qb];W[ng]C[White is very happy with the connection between the S14 and N16 groups]
;B[pi];W[ne];B[hj]C[Good move];W[gi];B[gj];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj]
;B[ci];W[hm];B[im];W[hn];B[in];W[gm];B[ho];W[il];B[jl];W[ik]
;B[jj]C[Good move!];W[hk];B[gk];W[gl];B[jk];W[km];B[ij]C[Good to play this first!]
;W[hl];B[jm];W[fr];B[er];W[dr];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[lk];B[jg]
;W[hi];B[ih]C[Good shape!];W[ob]
(;B[qd]C[wrong... if black did played 217 instead r16, can he lived?

This is bad shape (empty triangle).
S17 looks like the keypoint and will secure two eyes.];W[rc]
;B[rb];W[rd];B[qe];W[se];B[nn];W[pb];B[nl]C[this move is wrong... where is correct move to black get territory in right side?

P8, I think.
O8 leaves an opening between R10/Q11 and O8. White is using this opening later.]

;B[kn];W[ko];B[kp];W[lq];B[mr];W[jn];B[gr]C[Good move. 
White has no connection at the lower side and the K2 group has not enough eyes, so this white group has to connect to the stones above.]
;W[es];B[dq];W[cr]
(;B[mb]C[See variation move 188.

There are chances around N11!
Weak groups have always priority, to attack in this case.];W[nb]
;B[lb];W[nj]C[Very important for white to play in this area.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[kn];W[lm];B[lo];W[mo];B[mn];W[ko];B[mg];W[lo]

(;B[af]C[The white (big) K2 group is still very weak, see variation move 206.]
;W[no]C[This is where I stop my comments.

Keep in mind that weak groups have priority, either to attack or defend.

I hop this reveiw will help you to become a stronger GO-player. 
I also hope GO will bring you a lot of happiness in the future (just as it is bringing happiness to me)

But black is really happy with this. Black has a big moyo.

White is making 6 or 7 point in the upper right corner, about 20 points in the lower left corner, the two other white groups will probably life, but will not make more than a few points.
Black has a big moyo, but also some weak groups. If black keeps his groups alive he will win.]
