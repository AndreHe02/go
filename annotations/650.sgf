C[I'm White, a 30k, or so i think.

I only heard of go about 2 months ago.

I know I'm not good at fighting close.  This game shows my skill in that area.  I'd like to get stronger at fighting close, so an analysis of my fighting would be helpfull.
Thank you.

Game reviewed Aug 27, 2001, by Allan Wickberg, probably between 20k-15k, something. Comments are marked "al>", and indicates what I think would be right to do, IMHO.]
;B[dp];W[pd]C[
 dudune 29k*: hello];B[dd];W[pp];B[jp];W[pj];B[jd];W[dj]C[al> Beginners are usually adviced to play the first 30 or so moves no higher than the third line. Playing on the fourth line, like this, is for building influence on the board, rather than territory, something that weaker players generally have a harder time taking advantage of.

al> D10 would probably be better off at C10, where it would be easier to make territory.]
;B[qp]C[I was glad to have this lax opening,  because i hate fighting. I'm no good.

al> It is OK to walk away from a fight, if there are bigger points to be made elsewhere. No matter how good or bad fighter you are, it is still the guy with the biggest territory that wins :)]
;W[qq]C[al> Since the board is still wide open, it would be quite OK to ignore blacks attack and play somewhere else. I think I would have played C3, or C17, just to see how black would react to that. Another option would be to play C6, or C14, to try to build territory along the left side. The white stone at Q4 is not in any immediate danger, anyway.

al> Contact fighting strengthens both players positions in a region, and it should be used for surviving in a tight spot, or for defining territorial boundaries. If you are out to kill, contact playing is most often inefficient, since it leaves the attacker with a lot of weak spots, as we shall see later.

al> To me, this move indicates a will to grab the corner, as well as some territory along the bottom, pushing black towards the upper white stones in the process. Black would probably make a small (due to the white stone at Q10) living along the right side, but white would still be pretty happy.]
;B[qo];W[po]C[al> This looks OK, cutting the line between black's R5 and K4, to keep black contained to the right.]
;B[qn];W[rp]LB[pm:a][ql:b]C[al> This looks like putting the effort in the wrong place. To undercut black, S3 would be just as threatening, and make for a more solid position for white. However, playing Q7 (a) or R8 (b) seems more interesting. (a) to keep black to the right, while gaining influence towards the center, or (b) to chase black out into the board while building territory along the right as well as in the bottom at the same time. (b) also prevents black from going too far up the right side.]
;B[pn]C[al> Still time to play R8.];W[on]C[al> This cuts the line between the two black groups, but also creates a weak spot at P5. O5 would have been better for this purpose. N4 would cut less, but instead outlined a bigger chunk of (potential!) territory for white.]
;B[ro]C[al> If S4 had been at S3, white could now have answered with R8, putting pressure on black. This is why it is often better to hold back a little and build a stronger position, rather than to try to grab too much.]
;W[sp]C[al> White has to play S3 sooner or later. Might as well do it now, to secure the corner, and prevent the mess that black may cause by cutting at Q3. Another option (better, I think) is to play Q3 to ensure that a black cut at P5 will be trapped in a ladder, sacrifice S4, and then follow up with either R8 or M3.

al> A black cut at Q3 would split white's stones into two groups and suddenly white would be the one having to eascape from between two attacking groups.]
;B[om];W[pm]LB[pl:a]C[al> This cut puts white's stone in a ladder, at (a), which would give black not only life, but also access to the center of the board, being able to diminish the influence of white's Q10.]
;B[qm];W[pl]C[al> Black can still break out by hitting at white's weak spots. See var 2.]

(;B[ql];W[nn]C[al> O5 would be a better prevention of a black cut at P5. The black stone at P7 would still be rather lonely. O5 would also make white less open to the left, and make it easier to defend against a cut at Q3. Then again, without the weak spots, white would by now have a pretty solid territory in the lower right.]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[nm];W[ok]C[al> P9 keeps up the fighting without really accomplishing anything. White could put the foot down at R10 instead and start building territory in the upper right. P3 would also be a way out of this endless fight and score some real points.]
;B[qk];W[ee]C[al> I imagine this is supposed to counter the ladder breaker at D16? In that case, it would probably be better placed closer to the middle of the board; M9 perhaps. E15 will provoke black to strengthen the upper left corner, which will give black more points than white can hope for towards the center. If white wants to attack the top left corner, I think it should be done at C14, to connect to the other white stone. It is also possible to snatch the corner by playing C17.]
;B[de];W[ef];B[df];W[eg]C[al> It looks like white is trying to create a domain in the center of the board, but it is very hard to make points there. Corners first, then sides, then middle is the general order of making points.]
;B[mn];W[mm]C[al> It is more urgent to secure the bottom right corner. P3 is still a key point to prevent black cuts at P5 or Q3.]
;B[oo]C[al> Var 2 shows white playing P3]
(;W[no]C[al> I still think P3 is the important place to play. If black cuts at Q3 now, he gets the corner. see variation.]

(;B[op];W[pq];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[mq];B[mp];W[nl];B[lq];W[mo]
;B[mr]C[al> The corner is cut off and needs eyes, so white needs to play S2. See var 2. If black plays there first, white loses the corner altoghether.]

(;W[lp]C[al> Var 2: Black plays S2 first]
(;B[mq];W[or];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn]C[al> Black is getting a huge amount of points along the bottom, due to white's contact play. If he gets to play S2 first, the total is around 50 pts, including the corner, compared to white's 6 pts.]
;W[km];B[os];W[ps];B[nr];W[ns];B[ms];W[pr]C[al> black can still mess with the corner (see var 2). the critical thing is the weak spot at S3]

(;B[so];W[rr]C[al> Local score in lower right quadrant is now something like black 20 - white 15, but black has very good potential along the bottom to the left, and also to reach into what could be white territory along the right side.

al> If you are behind, it is easier to reduce your opponents territory than to build your own fast enough. Maybe then it would be good for white to invade the bottom right, at F3. However, as the board is still very open, there is a chance that it is better yet to try to stake some land elsewhere.]
;B[qj];W[qi]C[al> White adds another weak spot, Q11, to the one already present at P10. Black's group can't be killed anyway, so this move does not accomplish much.]
;B[pi];W[qh]C[al> Good. It is better to save R11 than Q10. There are more (at least easier :) points to be made along the upper right side than in the center.]
;B[oj];W[oh]C[al> R14 would be a better follow up to R12. There is no sense in attacking a live group.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[oi];W[mj];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[kj];B[li]C[al> White M10 now would make a solid wall and secure a couple of points.]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml];B[nj];W[kl]C[al> L8 is not so urgent. The white group only needs M7 to be alive, and there are bigger points to be made elsewhere.]
;B[nk];W[lg]C[al> M13 seals the black group in much better than M12 or N12 would have done, and is a good example of why contact playing is often to be avoided. Unfortunately, there are more urgent places to play, like R13.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[rj];W[ri]C[al> White should worry about the weak spot at R13. A black cut there would be very troublesome for white.]
;B[si];W[sh]C[al> See variation for a black cut at R13.]

;B[ld];W[mc];B[ke];W[lh];B[kg];W[kh];B[jf];W[dn]C[al> D6 should be lower, at C6, to attack the corner properly as well as to start outlining some territory along the left side.]
;B[jh];W[ji]C[al> J13, followed by J12, would be a better way to answer black K12. Then white could maybe get some points around F11. This way, white drives black into that area, destroying potential white territory. But there are other places to be played first - grabbing the lower left corner by playing C3 is one of them. Come to think of it, F3 would be even more aggressive, followed by C3 or J3, depending on black's answer.]

I didn't resign this game because I was proud of how well I'd done.

al> Being brave is good, but not enough. Actually, I think you would do even better if you would fight less. Remember that the bottom line is about territory,not about kills (although great kills can yield a lot of territory).

al> Some general tips:
- If you want to kill a group, enclose it from a distance, and remove it's eyespace. Then it is time for contact.
- Build solid walls (i.e. along the grid lines) to use as foundations for fights.
- Often it is better to chase a group without being too concerned with killing it, if you can build territory in the process.
- Look at the whole board, rather than getting intangled in local fights. There may be places where you can get more points even if it means losing the local situation.

al> Thank you for submitting this game for a review - it is always interesting! (And it is always much easier spotting mistakes when you are viewing a game afterwards, instead of when you are in the middle of it :)]

The other white group is weakened, but there are still so many big points to score on the board. The M3 stone might be bigger somewhere else, but I put it there to show a local possibility.]
