I'm going to just 'think out loud' in my comments, feel free to comment when the reviewer think i am seeing the position incorrectly.

Thank you very much in advance.

-----

Hey,

first of all, I'd like to thank you for giving me an interesting game to work on. I gave my best at judging the situations as well as giving explanations and recommendations, but often I felt that I was on the edge of my limited 15k (KGS) skills. Therefore the variations that I included are meant to be examples how things could work out; they are, however, by no means textbook examples - with a few exceptions that I actually took out of a book.

Secondly, I'd like to encourage you to continue working on your own games as thoroughly as you did before turning it in for a review. Your thoughts and questions helped me a lot to determine what you would like to know and how you saw the situation, and I strongly believe that the review was greatly improved by that. Moreso it encouraged me to give my best to give you the review that you deserve.

You will find a summary of thoughts about the game in general as well as recommendations on how to improve at the end of the game.

Enjoy,

Jan];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]C[truesaint: Everything seems normal up to this point.]
;B[nq]C[truesaint: then black invades...

A bit background information: I'm a beginner (starting out in november), so most of the time I'm playing black. Black move makes this a very unfamiliar territory...

--------------

Jan:

You'd best get used to this approach move as soon as possible. It's very often played in the fuseki (the opening), especially against a 4/4 stone since both players are likely to get an equally good result. 

See variation for a basic joseki worth remembering.]
(;W[qm]TR[pn][qn]C[truesaint: Looking back, this is probably 'too small'. Maybe i should try a pincer at L3 or something?

--------------

Jan:

I don't think it's too small. Actually, the standard response is either Q6 or R6, so the R7 is fairly wide; I don't think it's a bad move, even though I'd prefer to play solidly especially in the fuseki. 

See variation on your move.];B[jq]TR[lq]C[Jan:

This is too wide an extension. The weakness at M3 is just asking to be exploited...]
;W[gq]TR[fc][cf]CR[nc][qf]C[truesaint: Again, a rather passive move. At this point in my go study, I'm getting a bit paranoid to make aggresive moves since it usually meant losing the game...:)

--------------

Jan:

Loosing a game isn't a disaster if it helps you to learn. Don't play passively just because you might loose if you take a more active role - you're only likely to improve if you act on your own. It's especially important to do so as a beginner, in handicap games, for instance. Try not to think of the stones you get as points you just need to hang on to, but use them for attack instead.

I know a nice quote on that:

"Playing aggressively is a way to learn, not to win."

G3 isn't a bad move, but I think it's smaller compared to, say, an approach move at the marked positions. However, it has the added effect of threating the M3 play somet ime. Still, I'd prefer a different play for now.]
;B[pq]C[truesaint: This one is expected, actually. After K3, I was facing the choice of blocking on the left or on the right. I chose left (G3), so Q3 is naturally.

--------------

Jan:

Q3 is not that big, so don't worry.];W[dj]TR[qi]CR[qk]C[truesaint: instead of 'defending' again at R3, for example, which leads nowhere, so i played tenuki instead. A second alternative i was thinking about is somewhere around R11, but i chose this one instead.

--------------

Jan:

a) A play at R11 is too wide and is likely to get attack by a play at R9. 

Always keep this in mind: for a single stone on the 3rd line, the ideal extension is only 3 lines away, at R10 in this case. The two stones cannot be divided that way. If you have 2 stones, then the stone can be 4 lines away, etc. 

Playing any further is very risky and is only likely to endanger your objective. Besides, such a 3 line extension is almost enough to ensure your stones live if things get ugly.

b) D10 is a rather passive move - black can just ignore it and move on. Theres no doubt about the fact that it is a big move, but quite often even better than making a big move is making a big move that your opponent has to answer. Maybe an approach move would be a good idea now. R14 would be a good alternative, for instance. 

c) I wouldn't want to give up my corner to black like that. R3 might not be the biggest move, but your lower right is under attack right now and due to the large knights move at R7 you played, it's not that stable so I'd rather add a stone at R3 now to secure things.]
;B[cn]TR[co][bp][cq]CR[cj][ck]C[truesaint: I was getting *very* worried at this point since the opponent seem to be very aggresive...:) This happens a lot on my games, though, that the opponent will 'insert' a stone between my stones (a 'wedge' ??), and suddenly i'm feeling claustrophobic.

Any suggestions on the right line of thinking behind this?

--------------

Jan:

Two pieces of advice:

1) Don't think that one or two stones are enough to make something "your territory"; you might make actual territory there some time, but only far in the future. If you only think of it as possible territory thats likely to get reduced dramatically then such a move feels a bit less desastrous.

2) A quote from a fantastic fuseki book (Opening Theory Made Easy by Otake Hideo): "Have a counterplan to deal with invasions." 

Yes, that might seem obvious, but actually it's not. More often than not beginners (like myself) know that there is a risk behind their groups but instead of playing differently they just hope that nothing will happen. When you make a big move, try to play as if you expect that your opponent will invade. 

Here, you essentially have two options: pincer at C10 or C9, to which your opponent will almost certainly invade at C3 (note that your G3 stone is too far away to be of any help), so I wouldn't recommend it right now. Or you can defend at C3, B4 or, as you suggested, C5. 

See variations.]
(;W[cg]C[truesaint: This is another tough choice for me. I could either defend my corner with C5 or something, or ignore the threat. At that point i chose C13, but this could probably mean losing the corner if black plays C4 (??).

--------------

Jan:

It's fairly obvious that you got confused and didn't know what to do. Even though this move is also a kind of approach move, it's not severe enough to threaten anything in this position. You basically say that "I can't decide which move to play in the corner, so I don't play a move there at all. Instead, I'll just play a move that doesn't require you to answer and wait for your move."

I tried to come up with a few alternatives and to find out whether an invasion would work out. The play of C4 won't get black the corner since you can block at C3. He might get a piece of it, but not too much. Additionally, I expect you might come out in sente if he tries, which in turn you can use to attack him.

See variations.];B[ce]C[truesaint: I was chuckling at this point, seeing that the opponent is probably worried about the same thing...:)]
;W[pg]TR[mc][nc][qf][qg][cl]SQ[jg]C[truesaint: same idea as the C13 move. The plan was to test black's mindset. If black blocks, white takes K13, and reverse the situation on K3.

--------------

Jan:

Erm. You got me confused there.

Let's see. First of all, Q13 doesn't force black to do anything really. It's not an approach move (which would be found on the marked lines), nor does it limit black stones potential. It doesn't really make territory, either. All in all, it wouldn't be my choice of play, not even if I "wanted to test black's mindset".

Next up - K13? I might be wrong, but to me it looks like K13 would just sit peacefully in the middle of the board like a toad in the pond and be satisfied with doing nothing. Don't get fooled by the fact that it might look like the 3 stones have a connection since they are on the same 13 line. They don't have such a thing. In fact, we have 3 toads in 3 ponds a thousand kilometres away from each other! 

Additionally, just copying a formation doesn't copy its principles. If you were wondering about recreating the K3 situation in a way (which I don't get), then you have to play the exact formation in the same relative position in the board - on the third line, in other words.

Then again, maybe it's just that I don't get the whole mindset-testing-thing.....

As a side-note: Maybe C8 is a good alternative now. It gains you some territory, gives you enough nice eyespace and attacks the lonely black stone.]
;B[qi]C[truesaint: turns out didn't work as well as i expected...:) Black did this three times already, filling a stone 'inside' (on the third line), is this some general heuristics that i didn't know yet?

--------------

Jan:

Well, the basic idea is that linked groups are much harder, if not impossible to kill. Seperating them from each other means that one has two groups to worry about. Instead of one big group. This makes it much harder to ensure life.

The general mechanism of attempting to kill a group is to first prevent it from linking it up and then make sure it doesn't get eyespace or even eyes. Even if it isn't possible to kill a group (which is much more often the case than not, which has led to numerous defeats), then the mere fact that two weak group exist is enough for the attacker to make profit.

If you keep this "divide & conquer" strategy in mind, you will instantly become several stones stronger.]

(;W[oj]C[truesaint: i think this is looks rather good, in the sense that if I'm playing black, i'd be very worried about R11....:)

--------------

Jan:

Not a bad play, but don't forget that black normally doesn't want to live in the side. It wants to divide your stones and destroy possible moyo. 

See some possible variations.]
(;B[ql];W[pl];B[qk];W[jd]TR[qg][rg]C[truesaint: continuation of the original plan...

--------------

Jan: 

Might be a little early. I'd have like to put some more pressure on black on the side first, say, with R13 or S13.

K16 is a fairly big move, though, so theres nothing wrong with it. I'd play one of the moves above first - to which black is likely to answer to help his struggling black group - and then play O17, which might get black into trouble in the corner. But K16 is fine, too.]
;B[cp];W[cq]C[truesaint: a block is required here, i think?

--------------

Jan:

See? No worries above "losing the corner" ;)];B[co];W[md]C[truesaint: normally, i would do something about that C4 wall black is building, but i was in a teaching game earlier, and the sensei told me to 'play light'. At that point, i was also thinking about C8, but took N16 instead.

--------------

Jan:

It's allright to tenuki, but please keep in mind that your lower left corner is fairly unstable. I'd like a connection between D4 and C3 to feel save.

C8 would've been much better earlier. 

Now I would Prefer O17 much more than N16. The reason is that N16 doesn't build territory (the 4th line is the line of influence) and doesn't threaten blacks stone at Q16.]

(;B[nc]C[Jan:

That's where you should've gone..];W[fc]C[truesaint: seems like it's working... if black defends, i'm attacking...:)

--------------

Jan:

That's the spirit! But don't forget to make a securing move every now an then :)]
;B[ec];W[hd]C[Jan:

You saw the gap between your stones and realized that they're fairly insecure. Well done! However, you can't be too greedy now. The stone at K16 might help you a bit against a stone at h17, so now I would instead of H16 focuse on the upper right side and block with N17. Remember - the upper right corner is fairly open, and you might be able to get a good result since the moves that threaten the black group on the side also threaten the corner.]
;B[lc]C[truesaint: in retrospect, this seems 'wrong' for white, Maybe i should have fortified N16 first?]
;W[mc]C[truesaint: can't afford black having a wall here...]
;B[mb];W[kc];B[kb]
(;W[jb]C[Jan:

Argh! Just switch the order of the moves and things are okay. See variation.]
;B[kd]C[Jan:

Here are a few possible continuations if you had decided to use the ko. All in all, I don't think that taking the ko is a must here. Especially if you want to keep things simple, its better to just connect calmly for now.]

(;W[jc]TR[ic]C[truesaint: i don't know how to play ko, so i close it  instead and keep it simple. I'm wondering what J17 will do to black though...

--------------

Jan:

J17? I tried a few possible continuations. J17 will either result in the same situation you can get by connecting, or you might get the chance to either conceal black or attack the upper right corner. All in all]

Jan:

You got the ladder, so I wouldn't have connected. L15 would allow you to confine black now!]
;B[bq];W[br]C[Jan:

Dangerous. See variations.]
(;B[bp];W[dr]C[truesaint: i was looking at C2, but suddenly it seems that D2 is better, so i took it instead. Probably tired of blocking five times in  a row...:)

--------------

Jan:

Well done!];B[eb];W[fb];B[qg];W[ke]C[truesaint: After black R13, looks like that the right side is black's... should i be strengthening the right wall instead?

So i decided ignore the right side for now, and try to run to the center...

--------------

Jan:

I think you were right. You have a lot of influence in the center so keeping black from running there is a good idea. Only problem is that you are still short on secure territory, whereas black has 2 corners and 2 sides. Claiming the lower right corner would some time would be a good idea.]
;B[le]
(;W[je]C[truesaint: defending again... this looks bad for white.

--------------

Jan:

I'd have played M14. Preventing black from entering with that group is far too urgent to worry about defending a cut now!!

Besides, black can't make too much out of it. See variations.]
;B[lf];W[mf]C[truesaint: same situation, if black take M14 instead, those are dead...

--------------

Jan:

They're not dead that easily, but its better to get out of there nonetheless.]
;B[qp]C[Jan:

There goes the corner.];W[po];B[qo];W[rn]C[truesaint: I can't see why i was doing this move, though...

If black respond with R6, I'm going to have to deal with two cuts at Q7 and S7.]
;B[ro]C[truesaint: lucky?];W[qn]TR[pn]C[Jan:

Aaah, an empty triangle...!

Seriously, empty triangles are considered to be _the_ prime example for bad shape. Though there are sometimes cases where they need to be played, its better to look for alternatives - the marked place, for instance.]
;B[rq];W[qc]C[truesaint: this 3-3 is a mistake. I just got really fed up at defending....:)

--------------

Jan:

I asked a stronger player for her opinion and she came up with the analyzation that white can't live if black blocks at R16. However, since it blocked at Q17, you *can* live there - and had a very obvious chance to do so.

I won't give variations to this as I think they are fairly complex and won't help you much. Instead, I'll give comments on the way you played.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]
(;W[pb]C[Jan:

I'd have gone for S15 first, then made the cut at Q15 and then connected at S16. You'd be as good as alive then. (... I think ^_^)]

;B[rd];W[pe];B[oe];W[pf];B[qf]
(;W[nd]C[truesaint: very 'small'.

If i knew that the corner is dead, would have played elsewhere...

--------------

Jan:

An interesting alternative can be found in the variation.];B[ph]
;W[od]C[truesaint: Q12 was probably an 'enclosing' move meant to kill Q13's three stones.

P16 turns out to be not that bad, this is 'atari' that black couldn't ignore.

The thinking was to  connect later at P12 or something.];B[oc]

(;W[of]TR[ng][og][oh]C[truesaint: ???

Probably should have played either O13, P13, or P12.
Don't know what i was thinking...:(

--------------

Jan:

I don't think your stone is that bad. You suggested the marked locations; I tried them out and come to the conclusion that I like your move best. 

See variations.];B[la];W[ja]C[truesaint: i can't really see why black needs that M19 stone. Just to make an eye shape?

--------------

Jan:

It doesn't need it. If trouble arises black could just run out to the middle.]
;B[na];W[rc]C[truesaint: these are probably the sequence that lost me the game, since i didn't know that the group is dead anyway.

--------------

Jan:

Don't forget that your opponent has to answer your stones. Even though you keep putting stones into his territory that give him moku in the end, he has to put his own stones in there, thus reducing his territory. In other words: As long as the opponent responds, he doesn't make a single moku of profit.]
;B[re];W[pa];B[oa]TR[ra]C[Jan:

This is your chance! Black decided to play P19 instead of S19, the vital point of your group, for some mysterious reasons. If you had just played there, black couldn't have done anything. 

(You don't need to play T17 for that.)

See variation.]
(;W[sc];B[ra]C[truesaint: kaboom! :)

(;B[pk]TR[jg]C[truesaint: i knew that i was in trouble if i didn't stop the L13 formation, since those have two eyes already....

But my other stones are also in trouble here, if i try to close the K12/K13 gap, those two moves could cost me my whole O12 group.

--------------

Jan:

a) You don't need two moves, only the marked one.

b) Though O12 group doesn't have 2 full eyes yet, it can easily get them, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.]
;W[pm]C[truesaint: another error, it seems.

It would probably be better to block at P9, but that will invite a cut at Q7. The question is 'which one do i fear more'. Q7 wins.

--------------

Jan:

Allowing black to cut at Q7 is fairly dangerous as your stones might get seperated. I think protecting like you did was correct.]
;B[ok];W[ni]C[truesaint: trying to save the group.

I'd rather worry about the group on the lower right for now.]

(;W[gn]C[truesaint: probably should have captured here. I was somehow under the impression that those stones are dead anyway....:(

--------------

Jan:

Yes, capturing the stones would be huge for you - connecting two big group like that will be very likely to help you out when trying to convert your influence into territory soon.

G6 is too wide. I'd prefer to play F5 and stay out of trouble, if you want to defend.]

C[truesaint: just linking up stones up to this point. Maybe should have solidified two eyes in that corner instead?

--------------

The group is alive, not need to worry. F8 is an ok move; black can interfere, but you might be able to exploit that then.]

;B[hg];W[hh]C[truesaint: those H13 stones are getting on my nerves...:) Any advice on how to best handle these situations? Can't seem to think straight after that black K9 move.

--------------

Jan:

It's a difficult situation. I think I would have protected against the cut after K9, despite the fact that black will have a good position to go after territory and hunt your groups in the center then. There's no simple way to stop these stones from intruding, and thats enough of a catastrophe to accept problems concerning your weak groups.

The serious problem is that you're far behind on territory right now. Black has 3 corners and most of the right and lower side. You have hardly anything but weak groups - K12 group, for instance. You're group in the lower right isn't really save, either, so black might try to attack it some time. In such a situation, it's better to prevent further problems such as that H13 problem.

All you can do for now is use black to solidify some territory and build up strength.]

;B[mp];W[no];B[np]TR[hm]C[Jan:

Black is being rather friendly, helping you like that. Playing H7 is very huge now, as it keeps black from running into the center. 

Additionally, the group at M11 has no eyes and bad shape, and killing it is fairly easy at this stage. If you succeed in doing that, you have turned a good portion of the center into territory! However, having H7 open might cause problems, so playing that first has priority. Black will have problems making eyes with all that white around it.]

;B[mn];W[oo];B[op];W[nl]TR[lq][kr]SQ[fg][fh]C[truesaint: Two issues here that i need to ask:

1. The last 10 moves or so, both of us were playing very closely, just attaching stones. Is this too early ?

2. Sometime during those moves, i realized that those M10 stones could still be dead, if i can keep them from making two eyes. If those are dead, then my O10 formation will live, and i still have a chance.

--------------

Jan:

1. No, it's not too early. Even though you were "just attaching", you did so for a reason - to protect your moyo from being invaded, for instance. Even if there were big alternatives, your moves (or similar ones) had to be played. I think the marked moves are wasted, though.

2. The M10 stones are as good as dead. You might want to finish them off soon.
However, the O10 formation isn't dead even if the M10 stones live. To illustrate that, I will show you the possible moves once again.

I'm not sure whether I like O8. It's asking to be attacked, and you can't make territory big territory down there. I like on of the marked places better.]

But J11 makes one eye for black.... I was probably upbeat enough to think that it's not a problem.

--------------

Jan:

J11 doesn't seem to make much of an eye to me.

In all honesty, I think black is dead no matter how he plays. 

In such a situation where you know that there is no space for black to make eyes, it's important to play solidly. Don't play single stones right next to the group if you don't have to; that might give him the chance for a capture and a great shape for making eyes. Instead, play the stones in places where black has to jump to some time. 

See the variation for both of what I mentioned.]

GTL Reviewer, thank you in advance...!

--------------

Jan:

Even if you had played out the yose (endgame) correctly,  it sadly wouldn't have been enough. (Instead of putting your own stones into your territory, you could've used some gote endgame moves.)

--

Looking back at the game, I think there were 2 main reasons that caused you to loose the game.  

a) The Fuseki

You played some moves which didn't seem to give you much profit and thus you couldn't keep up with black making steady progress. Look back at the moves C13, N16 and, more importantly, Q13, for instance - all of these stones didn't secure territory but were focussed on influence. Even though it's important to have influence, you need to find a balance between that and territory, especially in the opening
Don't forget that the easiest location to make territory can be found in a corner, followed by the side. The center is the hardest to use for territory. Though you were able to make a lot of territory in the center (partly because black didn't seem to mind until it was too late), focussing too much on influence is dangerous and didn't pay out. Actually, you were lucky here; things could've been much worse since black could've invaded in your territory earlier on, and in the end (due to your problems with catchig a dead group), he could've even destroyed your whole territory! 

This isn't meant to say you have to focus on territory only. It's meant to encourage you to try to find a balance. Look at the board - notice how you hardly have any territory in the corners or sides?

b) To Tenuki Or Not To Tenuki

Knowing when to tenuki and when to play safe is extremely difficult and takes a lot of experience. You will even find Dan players being either too defensive or to agressive from time to time. 

Every time you consider to tenuki, ask yourself the following questions: How will my opponent react? And is the move I play in tenuki really bigger than if I just played safely? Often we want to tenuki but don't realize that it might be much more profitable to just hang on to what we have for a second. A prime example is the H13 stones walking into your territory, or how the O19 group came to existance in the first place.
Don't be greedy. You don't need to have the whole board as your territory in the end. All you need is a puny 0.5 moku difference; winning with 150 moku isn't better than winning with 0.5. A win is a win.

--

I'd like to say two final things. 

First, Go is a game; a very serious game at times, but still a game. Thus, don't hesitate to try out new things, or play an all-out agressive game when you feel like it. A nice proverb for that is: "You won't improve if you don't question anything." Don't feel forced to play cautious just because you lost some games. The only way not to loose is not to play. Theres a Japanese saying that goes: "Even a monkey falls of a tree from time to time".

Secondly, even though you lost the game and I've been critizing your play here, I think you played a good game, especially in the late middle. Many of the mistakes you made come from your lack of experience and you played some very good stones, too. 

All in all, I expect you will become much stronger soon (especially if you consider some of the stuff I mentioned ;-), and I'm looking forward to see some of your next games here on GTL, no matter who reviews them.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me or ask me on KGS - my nick there is Aveneer.

Have a lot of fun!

From now on things get unclear. White will try to get the whole upper right corner, which constantly serve as a ko-thread. Maybe white can even succeed in getting the corner. The black group in the upper side can live then, though, but with the corner as a compensation and your influence in the center, thats not too bad. It depends on whether you have something in the upper half to attack with your strength, and I expect that will be the case.]

C3 might turn out fairly similar to the joseki I showed you earlier, and it might be an alternative to C5 since it seals a part of the corner completely and might (1) might help to stabilize with G3. The drawback is that a) you loose territory, b) allow black to make easy life and c) you don't use your other stones to their full extent.

Personally, I don't think it's a very bad move.]

C[Jan:

Now white has multiple options. 

a) The approach move of C14:

White has a nice follow-up now: C14 is an excellent move as it's both an ideal extension from the two stones at C10 (4 spaces away, remember?) and an approach move towards D16. In other words: You build - fairly secure - territory, ensure life and force the opponent to react to your move. See possible continuation.

b) The hane at G8:

A rule of thumb is to never allow a hane at the top of your stones. And even though, of course, "no generalization is always true", it's undoubtedly a big move to play right now.

The it has a few drawbacks, though. You leave multiple cuts behind, which is usually not a good thing to do. And you push black into the direction of blacks own stones, which means you basically force him to connect them.

Additionally, I'd like you to take a look at the lower left corner. The stones look a little lonely, don't they? Sure, they got enough space to make life; but forcing black to confine them in the lower left corner isn't a great option. 

All in all, I'd prefer to leave things as they are right now and stick to a).

c) Use the white group in the lower left to attack:

Theres also the possibility of trying to attack with your lower stones, which means that the stones you use to attack also work to reinforce the group. A play such as D6, for instance, is heading for the cut at D8, attacking the stone at C6 and gives white options towards the center.

The fight will be quite complicated, though, and it's unsure how big your profit might be. 

Recommendation: First use option a), then, in the future, go for option c).]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[hc]TR[jc]C[Jan: 

Black is in a fairly unfavorable situation now. H17 is at the week point of blacks group - he would've preferred to secure his group by playing at K17, but now it's too late. Added to that is the threat of a 3/3 invasion at C17. In short, black's alternatives are either running away and giving you the chance to make territory attacking him, or try to live in the corner and help you build influence by keeping him there.

If black runs out, you have a nice thickness waiting for him in the middle left side, which you might be able to use for your advantage.

All in all, I like this alternative.])
(;B[cq]C[Jan:

You were wondering whether or not the C5 stone helps against an invasion of C4. I don't think thats a big problem. I was more interested in the idea that black tries to invade at some point. 

I tried it out and came - provided white plays what i consider "correctly" - to the conclusion that black cannot live in the corner as long as nothing down there changes, though it can gain a bit of territory and / or influence if it tries. I wouldn't worry too much about that, though.]

TR[jp]CR[lq]C[This is the joseki. Note that black 3 asks kindly whether it is allowed to invade the corner or not, to which white 4 gives a harsh no. Black then settles with 5. (Sometimes the hoshi at K4 can be played, too)

At some point in the near future, white would like to play at 6 to stabilize his group further and have nice options for development. When to play it is a matter of style, though; maybe it would be a good idea for white to use sente now and make an approach move of its own.

(Note that the exchange of 3 and 4 are often left out. In such cases, black will play at K4 to protect against a cut at M3.)]
)
(;W[kq]TR[qq]SQ[no]C[Since black can't easily make a base now, he will have to either invade at R3, abandoning the O3 stone in the process but gaining a third corner, or he can try to jump out with O5, thus dividing your stones and hoping white ends up weak with one of the two groups so he can attack them.

It's difficult for me to find a good example on the second idea. I made a few suggestions, but I'm not too satisfied with both of them. I think I'd go for the invasion if I were black.

The bottom line is: playing a pincer will almost certainly lead to fighting. Whether to play it or not is a matter of your playing style. However, if you decide to pincer, I'd prefer M3 as it's a bit tighter and more severe.]
