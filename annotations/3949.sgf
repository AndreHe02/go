C[-- Hi Nikolai,

my name is Zoran Rilak aka wayward on KGS.  I'll be doing the review for Black.  If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at zoran.rilak@gmail.com or leave a personal message at KGS.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[oe]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[-- An unorthodox move.  It seems Black's intention is to emphasize the top side and center.  P15, however, does little to secure any real territory this early in the game, and it leaves right side too open; White now has a good play at A or B.]
;W[md]C[-- White chooses to pick up a fight :)];B[jd];W[mf]
;B[le];W[me];B[ph]LB[qe:A]C[-- Good, Black has gained an excellent position at the right side (although it is a bit too high, White may be able to invade later at A for instance) but it is a very strong fighting shape.]
;W[od];B[pd];W[oc];B[dj]LB[pe:A][qf:B]C[ok until here?

-- Actually Black needs to protect the cutting point at A.  See what happens if White cuts there.  White can also play B if he feels like fighting.]

(;W[pj];B[nh]TR[oc][md][od][me][mf][ph]C[and this move?

-- It's a very good move, both as a reinforcement for Q12 and as an attacking move against White stones.  It's just the type of multi-purpose moves we usually try to make.]
;W[of];B[pf];W[ne];B[pe];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd]
(;B[ke]LB[je:A]TR[le]C[-- M15 is not an important stone anymore; it has played its part well and can be abandoned now.  White can cut at A at his heart's content and cause Black to lose much more than just one useless stone.  Better would be to keep pushing ahead, building strength towards the corner stone (see variation).]
;W[gd];B[ie]C[correct?

-- Totally.];W[ec]
(;B[ed]C[-- Wrong direction!  Black is strong to the right of the invading stones, so he needs to build strength to the left as well and attack with all his might.  This way, it is just too easy on White.  See variation.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[-- Better to seal off the corner with D17];W[dc]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[dg];B[ff]LB[fe:A]TR[dg]C[right?

-- E14, one line lower and in line with the four Black stones,  would make a better shape.  Notice the cutting point at A.  While it is true that White will not attempt to use it right away (Black cutting at F16 would hurt), it works well with the triangle stone for any possible michief White might want to try later in the game.

As a rule of thumb, it's better to play solid shapes when fighting up close; E14 is a basic shape-making move, which I'm certain you know of, but must have missed it in the heat of the battle.]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[hf];B[if]C[-- K13 would make better shape];W[hg]
;B[ih]C[-- here too, K12 is the shape we're looking for];W[hh]
;B[hi]LB[bb:A]C[-- A very important thing is to know whether you're chasing stones for a kill or simply directing their route outwards.  This White is in no immediate danger because it can easily live with A, so Black should consider it as alive and divert it away from his weak stones.  Black stones on the left are somewhat weakened by the escaping White, so instead of bending White towards them he should play F11.]
;W[gh];B[fi]TR[dg][gh]C[-- but now F11 is a bad idea since White can easily push through.  F12 instead.]
;W[gi];B[ii]C[-- Neither of these two stones is important; they don't make any territory, they don't cut apart or keep together any groups, nor do they have much of a fighting potential.  Black should play F12 instead to protect the left-hand group.]
;W[gj];B[dm];W[fh];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[ej]
(;B[fj]C[-- I suppose you meant E9 :)  See variation];W[fk]
;B[fj]C[unneccesary?

-- Quite.  As we said, this White group can be considered alive for all purposes (if Black takes B18, which is a big endgame move but no threat to the White group, White will just skip ahead to meet up with his friendly stones).  There's no point in trying to destroy its eyes.  Eyes are the last thing you should be concerned with; if you're after a group, first try to cut it, then see if you can close it off, then see if there's a way to make it lose its eye shape.  Similarly for defense.]
;W[dk]C[-- Note the difference between this and the position where Black took E9 point.]
;B[dh];W[fe]
(;B[ef]C[?

-- Don't do this.  It's bad shape; the name is "empty triangle".  A "triangle" because we have three stones at an angle, and "empty" because their pivoting point (in this case E13) is vacant.  What all this means is this: while Black is bending, he is getting only one additional liberty (that at D14), while all of White stones remain with the same liberty count.  This is almost never good (except in some rare cases, almost all of them concerning the corner).  Now if there were a White stone at E13, the shape would not have been so bad, because White would be losing a liberty at E14.

See variation for a better local play.];W[ee];B[de];W[cj];B[ck]
C[-- Risky...];W[cl];B[bk];W[dl];B[em]TR[ef][ff][fg]C[-- This is not the safest position to leave.  White has a cut at D14 to begin with, and in some variations it can lead to an unpleasant ko which might cause Black to lose his corner.  Better to play at D14 and make sure everything is stable up there.]
;W[bl];B[bj];W[cn];B[gl]C[-- Don't move those two stones just yet.  They are too close to a very strong group of White stones to be able to actually do any good.  Better to forget about them until a new fight emerges in their vicinity.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[el];B[hm];W[gp]C[-- now White can make territory while attacking weak Black stones, every Go player's dream]

(;B[nj]C[?

-- Here Black needs to make use of his strength by doing a split attack.  See variation for one promising idea.  Playing O10 only helps White gain more territory.]
;W[pl];B[np]C[right plce to attack?

-- It's playable];W[oq]
(;B[on]C[-- You should play the popular joseki here.  If you don't know how it goes, see variation.]
;W[pn]C[-- White is more than happy to secure a large side territory]
;B[kq]LB[mr:A]C[-- This is not so good anymore; White can slide under at A.]
;W[iq];B[io]LB[jp:A]C[-- White can break through at A.];W[ll]
;B[nl];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj];B[ij];W[lh];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh];B[ki];W[om];B[nm];W[oo];B[nn];W[no]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[eo]C[-- The morale is: don't go for center territory.  It's never worth as much as it looks.  Here Black has about 35 points in center territory by the most optimistic counting, and White has the same amount at the right side and corner alone, by the most pessimistic count.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[eq];B[hp];W[hq];B[ol];W[pm];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj]
;W[rk];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[ld]C[-- mistake :)];B[je]C[-- you needn't answer that]

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 20k)

-- It is overall a solid game; your strategical and tactical understanding of the game is balanced.  You are probably wondering in what way you should train yourself to progress.  I believe I've given some answers to that in my comments and variations during the game.  I believe you would profit the most by changing your attitude towards the game just a little bit: for instance, try going for corner and side territory instead of pursuing a large center.  Practice your reading and try to think in terms of "equal exchange" where players get comparably equal profits - then you'll be able to see if your opponent has made a mistake by giving you more than you'd optimally get.  Look at some higher-kyu or even pro games and see what josekis they play and what patterns emerge, how stable they are, how well they "work" with other stones on the board etc.

I hope you find this review helpful!  As I said, feel free to e-mail me with any questions you may have.

Best

(;B[pm]LB[nm:B][qp:A]TR[pj]C[-- This move is both an attack against the marked stone and an approach move in the corner.  White will have a hard time making good moves in both areas, especially so because Black is strong at the center.  Another use for this move is to indirectly help the weak Black group in the lower left, so this would be a triple-purpose move.

I've marked possible continuations for Black for the reference, illustrating the three main ideas of this move: A to mess up White's corner, B or something similar to attack the Q10 stone and stretch outwards towards the weak group.]

;B[dl];W[ek];B[cj]TR[cl]C[-- (note that an atari at C7 would be a terrible mistake by Black; I'll leave it to you to find out why)

With this sequence Black easily gains 5 points in the corner with an additional 4-5 if he gets the time to capture the C18 stone, plus some 10 points or so on the left side alone, especially if he manages to capture the marked White stone.  So, the initial two stone sacrifice was more than compensated for.

The general idea is to be able to look at more than just the stones immediately involved in combat.  The more one can "look around", so to speak, the more points will his moves be worth.]
