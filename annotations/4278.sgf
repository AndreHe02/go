;B[po];W[dd];B[oq];W[jj]C[Q: Hmm... that's not what I expected.(either Q16 or D4) why did white make that move?

A professional player wouldn't make this move, right. But it is not really a bad move either. It is a different kind of strategy, going for influence. I already saw high dan amateurs play such a move.]
;B[do];W[pd];B[fq]LB[cq:A]C[Q: Now my two corners are fortified, but he has more territory. Where should I have attacked first, the center or the corner?

First of all: your two corners are not save (as you see later in the game). Especially the lower left corner is open for an easy invasion. There is no way to kill an invasion at A. See the var. for a possible continuation.

And then: W has no territory at all, rather some infuence at the upper side of the board.

I think the position would be much better for b if he had some real territory, i.e. blacks stones were closer to the edge, as shown in the second variation.]

(;W[gl];B[dl]LB[jc:A]C[This move is ok, an alternative would be to play at A, to reduce the potential of whites moyo.]
;W[ll];B[lm]LB[jc:A][ql:B]C[Bad, because it achieves nothing. White is playing in the nowhere, no need to follow him. Still A is much better, or a move around B]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[jn];W[im];B[in];W[hn]
(;B[gm]C[Why? You are about to build a nice territory at the lower right. Continue that work! See var.]
;W[hm];B[ho];W[gn];B[fm]MA[gm]LB[go:A]C[Golden rule: Don't rescue every stone! The marked stone is nearly worthless. Continuing to build the lower side territory with A is much better.]
;W[go];B[hp]LB[ep:A]C[Q: white is heading towards my corner, and I didn't know how to stop it. I retrospect, would F4 have been effective?

H4, the move you played, is ok. The lower right territory is more important at the moment (because it's bigger than the corner). If you want to protect the corner, A is the correct point.]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[dq];B[co];W[cp];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[er];B[fr]
;W[eq];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[cr]C[Q: How could I have stopped G5 from taking place? The D1 group would be a good balance under other circumstances, but is it here?

As I said before, the corner was not so important. You got a good compensation the the lower side, and also a bit on the left.]
;B[fl];W[fp]C[Q: Ouch! should've seen that coming.

Your last move was not so bad. This white move is a mistake, because...]
;B[eo]LB[gq:A]C[... no need to answer by saving this stone. Just play A, to protect your territory at the lower side.]
;W[gq]MA[es][fs][fr][fq]TR[ep]C[Now your squared stones are lost. You lost them while saving your triangled stone. A bad exchange...]
;B[gp]LB[hq:A]C[Q: was that a good move? I succesfully enclose the WH6 group. But I'm worried about F1, now.

Since F3 is lost, you enclosed in fact nothing. It would be better to give up the 4 stones and play e.g. at A]
;W[fo];B[hs];W[hr];B[hq];W[gr];B[ir];W[gs];B[is];W[iq]MA[ir]
[is][hs]C[You can (and maybe should) save the three marked stones, see var.]

(;B[io];W[jq];B[hl]LB[jc:A]C[Q: what I tried to do with H8 was force WG9, then play L8. Unfortunately, I was unsuccesful. Maybe I was thinking too hard?

Yes, you saw it later. Again, take a look at the whole board. Stil, A is a good move. ;-)]
;W[gk];B[ik]C[Q: at this point I realized L8 was not a good option. But I guess I wasted my time trying to save H8

Again, you are right.];W[hk];B[ij];W[il];B[fj];W[jr];B[ko];W[js]
;B[kq];W[mm]MA[kq]C[Q: grr! How do I get out of this situation in the lower right? He's really pushing me.

Your last move (squared) did not achieve much. Maybe you should have played whites move (N7) yourself.]
;B[ml];W[mn];B[ln]LB[lo:A]C[*Very* bad shape, in fact it is an empty triangle. A is much better.]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[mo];B[kp]LB[lp:A]C[A instead helps to connect to the stones at the right.]
;W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq];W[np];B[kr];W[mr];B[nq]LB[cf:A][jc:B]
[qf:C][nc:D][lr:1][ks:2][jp:3][jo:4][ip:5]C[This move does not achieve anything. Your stones in the lower middle are definitely lost. They have only 5 liberties. White has still more, even if he does not answer.

I would play one of the moves from A to D instead.];W[ms];B[jk]
;W[jl];B[hj];W[kk];B[gj];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk]C[Q: isn't N9 a bad move? I would think so! lol.

Not really bad, compared to the moves before. Still, both of you are missing the big points at the upper side.]
;B[nl];W[nk];B[nm];W[op];B[no]MA[nq][oq]LB[pq:A]C[You still try to kill white. But this is not possible, especially because white can easily capture the two black stones by playing at A.]
;W[mp];B[nn];W[pq]C[Q: I seem to be missing a lot of urgent points.(likeQ3) Could you please point some out to me?]
;B[fk];W[hl];B[ji];W[kj];B[fn]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[Q: Argh! I was supposed to play M11!

Your last moves were good, solidifying a great wall. F6 is not needed, white cannot really push through there.

But why M11? You meant L11 (which would be better)? If not, are you trying to kill the big white dragon in the middle? Maybe you missed the fact that it is connected the the lower left group?

If I had to choose a move, I would use the wall and play A or B.]
;W[pp];B[pn];W[oo];B[on];W[pl];B[li]C[Very bad. Your stones around O6 are in immediate danger. You have to play there to save them. You cannot capture the white dragon, as explained earlier.]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[nj];B[mi];W[oj];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[pj];B[qm]
;W[ro];B[rk];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl];W[sm];B[rl];W[rn];B[ki]
;W[fq];B[ni];W[oi];B[ii];W[rm];B[dm]C[Why? White cannot cut here. A move on the upper side would still be good.]
;W[qn];B[de]C[Q: I give up on the lower right. lol. I suck. ^.^

Which is very wise to do now! Finally you found a move in an area wher big moves are available!]
;W[pm];B[ed];W[dc];B[ec];W[qo];B[of]LB[nc:A][nd:B][ce:C]C[A, B or C are better. They threaten to build a hughe territory and/or kill the upper left corner.]
;W[om]C[White has to be carefull. He had captured many of your stones, but also let you play many moves around the upper side. He could very well lose the game, if he continues to play overly save. All of his last moves had in fact negative value, just putting stones in his own territory.]
;B[jd];W[jp];B[dh]LB[nd:A][ce:B]C[This also is a move insiede your own territory I still would prefer A or B.]
;W[jo];B[od];W[ip];B[pe];W[ks];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc];B[oc]
;W[qb];B[oa];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa]C[The board is now more or left divided from the lower left diagonally to the upper right. If you can kill both corners, wou will win the game. If not, winning will become very difficult.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[re];W[sd];B[se];W[sb];B[sc]LB[ra:A]C[Big mistake. A is the move to kill the group.]
;W[ra];B[oe]C[Q: BAM!! don't get mad, get glad! Ziploc tight! lol.

Yes, unnecessary. Killing the uppper left would give you some hope to win the game.]
;W[lr]C[Q: ouch.

Yes, ouch for w. Taking these (already dead) stones off the board means putting another stone into his own territory, and gives you a free move somewhere else.  White is really about to lose the game now...]
;B[oh];W[ph];B[og];W[pg];B[jf]LB[ce:A]C[White cannot live there, still A would be better.]
;W[hd];B[gf]LB[ic:A][ee:B]C[There are two ways for you to protect white from making life there. Cutting off whites room at the edge, because it is easier to make eyes at the edge. That would mean to play maybe A. Or stabilizing your own weak stones, that would mean to play B.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[fc];B[gd]LB[eb:A]C[Q: How about this move here? Is this good? I'm definitely nervous about keeping white out of my massive territory.

A is better: Holding white seperated, killing the corner, and making it difficult for white to make eyes at the edge with his upper-middle group.]
;W[gc];B[ge];W[ic];B[id]LB[jc:A][eb:B]C[A is better, narrowing whites space. And, of course, B, which is important for both sides.]
;W[he];B[if]LB[jc:A][eb:B]C[Still A (or B). There are no eyes in the middle.]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[ie];B[je]LB[eb:A]C[Q: This whole exchange is leaving me fairly anxious. I know that he knows what he's doing. I don't know what I'm doing. But I am learning.

If he knew what he was doing, he would have played A, connecting both groups and making life It is much better than all of the last moves.]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[jc];B[kc];W[eb];B[jb]C[Q: is that a a good move?

Not bad. But since white lives now, no matter what you do, the game is over.]
;W[ib];B[kb];W[ce];B[cd]LB[cf:A]C[Q: what about that move? Risky, eh?

Yes, A is better.];W[cf]C[Bad mistake, see variation.]
(;B[cg];W[df];B[gg]C[Q: it's shaping up to be a repeat of F5!]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[dg];B[eh]C[Q: I stop it. *whew*];W[bg];B[ch]

Mh, I don't know what you mean here...];W[aq];B[ap]C[Q: From experiene, that's definitely an urgency! lol.]
;W[rg]

A toast! to the reviewer! *raises imaginary wineglass* You wanna know why it's imaginary? I take medication that would cause a lethal reaction should I come into contact with alcohol. Therefore, I will be beer free for my entire life. ^.^ Oh boy.


Generally speaking, when playing on a 19x19 board, you should try to look at the whole board, not just playing where your opponend played. I pointed out many opportunities to do so.

You also should improve your life&death play. In many times you tried to kill groups which were not killable, or missed the vital point, like S19. You should focus on these things first, the fight in the upper left was very complicated. To train life&death, you can play games on smaller boards (it is a good training, no matter what rank you are), or read books, like the Graded Go Problems for Beginners. I would suggest Vol. 2 for now.]
