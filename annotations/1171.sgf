;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep];W[do]C[eo: A bit unusual, but might be ok.]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[en];B[go];W[di]C[RGW: This doesn't look quite right.  Is there a better play here?

eo: Looks fine to me.];B[gd];W[de]C[RGW: Is this a reasonable defense?

eo: Yes. But whites position is a bit unbalanced, since all stones are on the left side, so maybe it's better to play at J16.]
;B[jd];W[qj];B[qn];W[qg];B[qe];W[kq]C[eo: Nice move. Since O3 and H3 are miai, there shouldn't be any problems to make a base here.]
;B[iq];W[nq];B[pr];W[ko];B[nc];W[or]C[RGW: It seemed like I needed some defensive move here.  Was this ok?

eo: It's not urgent to defend, but P2 is nice if you wan't to create som aji in the corner.]
;B[oq]
(;W[op]C[eo: I don't like this move. All possibilities in the corner are gone now.]
;B[pq];W[oo];B[on];W[po]C[RGW: The sequence from here got me in some trouble.  Was this move a mistake?

eo: This move will make the group heavy, but it could be ok if you have a plan to handle the situation.]
;B[qo];W[pn]C[RGW:
This ended up allowing black to cut apart my stones so I'm guessing it was
wrong.  Would O6 have been better?  Is there an even better move here?

eo: When you have played Q5, this is the natural continuation.]
;B[mq]
(;W[nr]C[RGW: Another mistake?  I should have played N4?

eo: The game losing move. You can only play O2 if you have read out that the cut at O4 is safe. P2 is not imortant, so O4 is probably best (see variation).]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[pm];B[mo]C[eo: Black should capture immediately at n2 (see variation).]

(;W[lp];B[mr];W[nn]C[RGW: Another mistake I suspect?  Maybe L7 or O7?

eo: Yes, the L5-group is getting weak so L7 is necessary. Difficult game for white now.]
;B[mn];W[nm];B[lm]C[eo: Black N7 is better.];W[ip];B[hp];W[jm]
;B[dg];W[fi]C[RGW:
I have the feeling this move was completely off base, but I didn't know what
my goal should be: Save the stones in the corner? Save the stone at D11?
Attack the black stone? Grab territory somewhre around D9?  I didn't (and
still don't) know what should be a priority.

eo: This is your chance to get back into the game. By attacking this stone you might be able to take some profit and/or reduce blacks territory on the top side. F11 looks ok, but maybe E14 is a stronger attack.]
;B[bh]C[eo: F13 seems more natural.];W[bj]C[RGW: Too passive?  Wrong side?

eo: You had to defend here, a black move at C10 would be unbearable. B11 is also fine.]
;B[ce]C[eo: C16 first is probably better.];W[cd];B[be];W[bd]
;B[df];W[ee];B[fg];W[ff];B[fh];W[fd]C[eo: Strange move. Why do defend where there is nothing to defend?   Play G14 directly to keep the preassure on the black group.]
;B[gc];W[gf]MA[fd][gc]C[eo: Look at the marked stones. Who gained on this exchange?]
;B[hh]C[eo: Black should hane at G11 first.];W[gi];B[hg];W[hf]
;B[hi];W[jk];B[hk];W[ij];B[hj];W[io];B[jq];W[ml];B[fk];W[el]
C[RGW: Reasonable defense?

eo: Yes.];B[fl];W[ld]C[RGW: Reasonable reducing move?

eo: No. M17, L16 or N17 are the normal moves. M16 lets black connect easily, so you don't really reduce much.]
;B[lc];W[kc]C[RGW: Wrong side?

eo: Not very big difference.];B[kd];W[mc];B[lb];W[md];B[mb]
;W[ic]C[RGW: Another useless move?

eo: Seems so.];B[id];W[oc]C[RGW: And another.];B[od];W[fc];B[gb]
;W[fb]C[eo: Not urgent to defend here.];B[fn];W[of]C[eo: Good move! If black had played here the game would be over.]
;B[nd];W[mf];B[lf];W[lg]C[RGW: I sacrificed three stones to get more territory.  A reasonable trade?

eo: Very much so. Give 6 points to take 25 !];B[me];W[mg];B[kf]
;W[kg]C[eo: M8 is more important.];B[jf];W[dh];B[eg];W[br]C[eo: Big, but too early.    M8, R7 and S14 are all bigger.]
;B[dp];W[bo]C[eo: Is it really necessary?];B[kl]C[eo: M8 is more severe.]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[kj];B[mk]C[eo: This doesn't work.]

;W[ql];B[rl];W[qk];B[rk];W[rj]C[eo: S14, G19 and h2 are bigger.]
