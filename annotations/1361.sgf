C[Black Rank: 24.14 Write Rank: 23.8 Round: 5  Requesters comments:
A very close game with some areas I think could have turned this into a victory. I have put in some variations which may have made a difference but lack the experience to be sure they are reasonable.


Hello Kurt

this game was interesting to go over. Both sides had their chances to win.   I hope my comments will be helpful to show you other possibilities of play. I might have made mistakes in my judgements too.   Please keep in mind that only pros understand this game fully :-)]

(;B[pf]TR[jd]C[Tetsujin (T):Approching White's stone from the left side is better as it stablize your marked stone. At the moment you deliberately create 3 weak groups on the board to look after.

the variation of move 63. but I can't be sure I have seen the best moves for white

T: All right, first let's roughly estimate how many points every side has earned so far.   1) White (marked with squares)

- has got quite secure territory on the lower part of the board which is worth approx.26 points

- upper side 6 points

total: 32 + 5.5 komi = 37.5 points

2) Black (marked with triangles)

- left side: 34 points

- right side: 27

total: 61 points

As you can see Black is leading by comfortably 23.5 points at the moment.   Concerning your second question about the best answer for White if Black plays at B. see variation.]

C[T: Black q5 is better as it gives Black 2 more points of territory.

Playing q1 now is far too small. It's an endgame move. There is no need to play it at this stage of the game.]

obviously wasn't there.
