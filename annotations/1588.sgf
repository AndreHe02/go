AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Thank you for looking at this.  I have a few questions.    RickMott: glad to help. :)

1.) Did I need to protect myself from getting cut at e15(mv 24) and b9(mv 36)?  RickMott: no and no.

2.) Was mv 58 (P1) what made me lose the bottom right corner?  RickMott: yes, just
connect at P3 is better.  But this was not a huge loss.

3.)On mv 110-118, should I have played that any differently?  RickMott: This whole
little sequence was played in a relatively unimportant part of the board.  See the
detailed commentary in the game for where the key areas were.

Also, if you have any other comments on the game as to how I could have played better or have changed my game, please let me know.  I played with a 4 stone handicap against a 12kyu player.
Thank you very much.

RickMott: In general, you are play extraordinarily well for your level of experience.  Your
minor errors are in missing some cutting/connecting problems; bigger issues are learning
to evaluate where the big potential is for both sides, and finding dual-purpose moves
(enhancing your potential while constraining your opponent).  But of course, it's been 3
weeks since you played this game so you're probably better than I am by now... :)

There are lots of comments throughout on tactical issues, but mostly I tried to help
you find the most important areas of the board at any given time.  Learning to recognize
when you don't have to respond locally and can make a big play somewhere else
will make a huge difference in your game.

Good luck!......   Rick Mott

  
Ling [?\]: hi
Ling [?\]: gl
cloud122 [12k\]: hi];W[jj]C[RickMott: This is a very unusual move for white, and should be a disadvantage.
It does  make a moyo strategy for Black more difficult.  You should take any
3rd-line side point in response.];B[qj]C[RickMott: That's a good one... :)]
;W[gp]C[RickMott: Again, an unusual approach.   Too high to make territory, too far
to pressure black's corner stone much.  I would ignore this and play K17.]
;B[cn]C[RickMott: This is too close (overconcentrated).  4th line would be OK (D6).
I still think K17 would be bigger, though.];W[np];B[qn]C[Ling [?\]: where are you from?

RickMott: Again, extend on the 4th line in response to an approach on
the 4th line.  Q6 is better.];W[dj]C[cloud122 [12k\]: nj u?]
;B[ck]C[Ling [?\]: ID, with no Go club

RickMott: Too close to White's isolated stone; you will just make it stronger.
Also, not as big as a move at the top.  Your two stones are already strong
enough, you don't have to reinforce them.  You can't make much territory
in the lower left, because there are high white stones on both sides of you.
So look for a big play elsewhere.   Focus on the largest open area of the board,
which is now the top.];W[cj]C[cloud122 [12k\]: none here too

RickMott: None??  At least 4 clubs in NJ: Princeton (me), Livingston and
Piscataway (both run by Feng Yun 9P, www.fygc.com) and Hoboken (at
Stevens Institute of Technology).];B[dk]C[RickMott: after this exchange, white has forced you into an overconcentrated
position and has an ideal extension from his two-stone wall to C14, which is
also a good approach move to the corner.];W[ej]C[Ling [?\]: I thought nj was bigger than idaho... hmm]
;B[bj]C[cloud122 [12k\]: well there are some but not close bt me

RickMott: The top is still bigger, but if you're going to play
here you should extend down from the corner stone at C13
to prevent white's extension.];W[ce];B[de]C[RickMott: I would defend the corner with C16 instead.  Because white
didn't answer B10, you can always hollow out any white territory here
with B11 or B12 later.  But this isn't bad.];W[cd];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[ec];W[bc];B[db]C[RickMott: This result looks good for black.  You get a very strong shape facing
the open top area. while white gets at most a few points.];W[df]
;B[ef]C[RickMott: This move is good, but it might not be sente.  As white, I might ignore
it and play an invasion at the top, somewhere around K16 or L17,  to prevent you
from completing the moyo.  I think you should play at the top center first.]
;W[dg]C[RickMott: but white responds locally, so you get another chance.]

(;B[ee]C[cloud122 [12k\]: this move is not needed

RickMOtt: Right, top center is critical for both sides.];W[nc]
C[RickMott: This is a big loss for you.  Compare the situation with having a black
stone at K16, for example.  You could pincer at M17 and either chase white into the
center, making territory as you go, or seal him into the corner getting a strong
outside position.  Either way, you are far ahead.];B[qf]C[RickMott: Again, the 4th line is better (Q14), but in this case you might want
to consider a pincer from the left at L17, for example.];W[jc]
;B[hc]C[RickMott: Much too close to your own strong wall.  White's extension is an
overplay in an area of black strength; you really ought to play M17 to separate
white's stones.  The fighting will be to your advantage.  White will have a hard
time keeping both stones alive.];W[ne];B[og]C[Ling [?\]: bt?

RickMott: This move neither puts pressure on white, nor makes much
territory for black.  White has two 4th-line stones at the bottom, which
is highly unusual; you should take advantage of it.  Invading at M3 or J3, or
playing to separate white at K4 or L4, would be good.  You could also
play contact at P17 to make white's top group overconcentrated.  On
balance, I like the bottom invasion slightly better because it also gives
you some chance of attacking later.];W[qc]C[cloud122 [12k\]: *by]

(;B[qe]C[Ling [?\]: ahh
Ling [?\]: sorry

RickMott: This is too passive, letting white get too much.  The variation is better.]
;W[pc]C[Ling [?\]: feel free to comment on my plays after the game, cause I am a newbie]
;B[qd]C[cloud122 [12k\]: oh when u started playin?
Ling [?\]: a week ago

RickMott: This move is not important.  The bottom is still much bigger.  If you
want to play locally, play P16 instead, but I would prefer to play at the bottom.]
;W[ek]C[cloud122 [12k\]: haha
cloud122 [12k\]: u play very good so far
Ling [?\]: why you laugh? thank you
cloud122 [12k\]: i thought 
cloud122 [12k\]: u were better than me
cloud122 [12k\]: i was wondering about ur rate
cloud122 [12k\]: cuz u play very solid]
(;B[bk]C[Ling [?\]: oh no, just watch I will lose

RickMott: You are very strong here, ignore white and play at the bottom.  Or play
P6 to make your right-side moyo bigger first.];W[em]C[Ling [?\]: but thank you for your comment
cloud122 [12k\]: u play much better than a newbie];B[fq]C[Ling [?\]: thank you, but I still have a lot to learn

RickMott: This is too close to your strong corner, so it doesn't make much
territory, and it forces white to turn his isolated stone into a two-stone wall
facing the open bottom territory.  A teaching professional I know calls this
a "thank-you" move, because you help your opponent.  As a general rule,
don't play adjacent to a weak (isolated) opposing stone.];W[gq]
C[cloud122 [12k\]: as do i];B[gr]C[RickMott: This is an end-game move.  You really need to invade white's potential
territory at M3 before he can enclose it.];W[fr];B[er];W[eq]
;B[fs];W[fp];B[fr];W[ep]C[cloud122 [12k\]: thats ur pic?];B[dr]
C[RickMott: Blocking at D3 is much better.  You also retain sente (initiative) since
if white doesn't block at H2 you can reduce his bottom area.]
;W[dq]C[Ling [?\]: nope, its just a pic of someone
cloud122 [12k\]: oh]
(;B[hr]C[cloud122 [12k\]: i'll review this game after if u want
Ling [?\]: thanks
cloud122 [12k\]: np
cloud122 [12k\]: what made u interested in go?

RickMott: You really ought to defend with C3.  If white cuts at C4, no problem.
See variation.];W[cp];B[do];W[co]C[Ling [?\]: Well, I really love all of asia, and I saw this game on a cartoon, and figured I would look into it
cloud122 [12k\]: hikaru no go ?
cloud122 [12k\]: haha];B[dn];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[Ling [?\]: maybe that was the name of it, not for sure

RickMott: You can cut at C3 and keep the entire lower left corner.
I think that would be bigger than defending here.  See variation.]
;W[oq]C[cloud122 [12k\]: should connect
Ling [?\]: q3?

RickMott: Yes, although the cut at C3 may still be bigger.]

(;B[os];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[op]C[RickMott: This doesn't do much and leaves complications.  Descend at S3 instead.]
;W[qp];B[rq]
(;W[no]C[RickMott: This is a mistake by white; he can capture in a ladder starting with Q5.
See variation.  That means your previous descent with S3 was wrong.]
;B[rp];W[iq];B[ir]C[RickMott: Both sides continue to overlook the cut at C3.  White's move fails
to defend the bottom; black can jump (K2) instead of making a solid extension.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[hp];B[ip]C[RickMott: this cut is too aggressive; white should ignore it.  Shielding his
eyes from glare of the neon sign flashing "Play C3!!! Play C3!!!", locally white
should surround this stone on a large scale with something like P5 atari followed
by a jump to P8 or P9.];W[jp]C[Ling [?\]: how long have you played go?
cloud122 [12k\]: hmm];B[io]C[cloud122 [12k\]: i learned
cloud122 [12k\]: around 4 yrs ago
cloud122 [12k\]: only been really into it 6 months ago
cloud122 [12k\]: so i guess around 6 months exp
cloud122 [12k\]: mayb longer
cloud122 [12k\]: in the summer
Ling [?\]: I see... what brought you into the game?
cloud122 [12k\]: the cartoon haha
cloud122 [12k\]: then i just got hooked];W[jn]C[RickMott: White plays too close here.  He can afford to be much further
away.  So you, resolutely ignoring C3, should play something like P6 to
expand your right-side moyo and constrain white's center area.]
;B[ho];W[fn]C[Ling [?\]: I see that the cartoon is bringing a lot of people to the game
cloud122 [12k\]: yea

RickMott: You need to learn to stop throwing good stones after bad.
By adding stones to the hopeless J5 group, you're forcing white to
strengthen himself on the boundaries of his center area.];B[cq]
C[RickMott: GREAT MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :)];W[cr];B[bq];W[br]
;B[bp];W[jr];B[fo]C[RickMott: Excellent!  White can't escape.]
;W[go];B[gn]C[Andreas [12k?\]: cranes nest
cloud122 [12k\]: see u are no newbie
Andreas [12k?\]: im impressed

RIckMott:  Me too :)]
(;W[pl]C[Ling [?\]: seriously, I have only played for a week
cloud122 [12k\]: haha
cloud122 [12k\]: u read any books?
Ling [?\]: no, just did some go problems on this computer program
cloud122 [12k\]: ic
cloud122 [12k\]: good job in seeing that
Ling [?\]: thank you];B[ol]C[RickMott: Attaching to the weak stone from the outside is too aggressive; you
create complications, which favor the stronger player.  I like P6, which keeps the
stone from connecting to the bottom white group and also serves as a launch pad
to reduce the white center.]
(;W[om];B[pm]C[RickMott: White was nice to you here.  He would have done better to push through
at Q7.  He has the aji of an atari against P4-Q4 to help him connect out, and can
also push on the other side through Q9.  The result would be very complicated fighting,
but your P8 stone might well be in trouble.];W[pn];B[qm];W[qo]
C[RickMott: This is a mistake by white.  He can keep sente by playing P5 atari, then P9 atari
and connect at Q9.  Your single stone will be fighting at a disadvantage.  Or he could push
through at Q9 and keep fighting after the P5-R5 exchange.];B[on]
;W[po];B[nm]C[RickMott: This is good for black, but you shouldn't have done this well.]
;W[nn];B[pk]C[RickMott: This play is not necessary.  the big area in dispute is the boundary between
black's right area and white's center area.  You should either jump to M7 to reduce
white, or play around O8 to complete your moyo.  You are way ahead at this point,
though.  Hard to see how black can catch up.  You should play to simplify the game
and take no chances.];W[ro];B[rn];W[so];B[rr]C[RickMott: It's sente, but you can't live here.  Save it for a ko threat.  Big plays
elsewhere:  jump to B12 to reduce white's area; jump to M7, ditto; B18, secure
the corner in sente; J15, enlarge your area and reduce white's potential; O10,
complete your moyo.];W[ps];B[lm]C[RickMott: Good, this is one of the choices I gave.  I think it is one of the better
ideas, because you reduce white and enlarge your own potential at the same time.]
;W[gm];B[hn];W[fg];B[gf]C[RickMott: This is small; N13, M10 would be much bigger.]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[gh];B[fh];W[eg];B[hh];W[gi];B[ff]C[RickMott: Why are you worried?  If white pushes and cuts, you will atari his stone
at H14.  Do something to complete or enlarge your moyo on the right.]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[jh]C[RickMott: Small moves on both sides.  For black, these two stones are not important.
For white, although it's too late, reducing black with N10 is bigger.  So is saving
territory with B11, but that's too passive.];B[hf];W[if];B[ie]
;W[je];B[jg];W[jf];B[kg];W[ji];B[kh];W[hm];B[jm];W[in];B[eo]
;W[kn];B[km]C[RickMott: Compare the result of this move with completing your moyo, which
can now go all the way to M10.  Ignore the single stone, don't connect it.  It
is not important.];W[im];B[il];W[hk];B[jl]C[RickMott: You don't need to make this connection.  The stone is
small, and white can't cut anyway.  You would capture in a net or
ladder.];W[mi]C[RickMott: right idea for white, but one line too high.  N10 would be very difficult to stop.]
;B[li];W[mj];B[lj]C[Ling [?\]: I am using too much time];W[lh]
C[RickMott: White should jump back to N13 instead.  He will get a good reduction of
the black territory.];B[lg]C[cloud122 [12k\]: well its good tat u think]
;W[mh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nh]
(;W[ki]C[RickMott: White missed a bet here.  M9 is dangerous for black.  See variation.]
