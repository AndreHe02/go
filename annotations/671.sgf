This was an interesting game to comment and I  hope you like the review. As I made comments for  both sides pls. forward this review to your  opponent. If you like my style of reviewing feel free  to download other reviews I made for GTL.

As always - any questions, suggestions or thank  you notes are welcome :)

Danthekyu [5k\]: yes, i agree

kankatsu1 [5k\]: indeed. i mismanage your invasion  in  the left upper corner
Danthekyu [5k\]: but me also in the end
Danthekyu [5k\]: was not severe enough

White made a bad start and then lost the game at  the bottom-left. Black had serious problems in the  upper-left that made the game close. Had white  attacked black on the left side he could have won  the game.
Both players made some mistakes in the endgame  but that did not change the result.

Thx. for listening :)
