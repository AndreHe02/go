AB[pd][dp][pp]C[RS: Hi Abe. This is my first review here at GTL, so maybe take this with a bit of salt. I am 7k on Dragon Go Server where my ID is 'rasa'. (As an aside, this is an excellent site for playing go: www.dragongoserver.net) I am a bit confused as to why you asked for this review since you killed white. In any case, I'll try and answer your questions.
  I have found when I play a handicap game as B, I have almost always lost when I attack W directly since W is almost always stronger at fighting. I have found the best strategy for me is to threaten. Threaten to cut him, threaten to kill him, threaten to invade, etc by playing close to him but not next to him. When you play close to him, you will almost always be playing from other B stones making yourself stronger. W will live, but small with little territory, and you will become stronger with more territory.]
;W[ec];B[gp]C[agong81 [20k?\]: hi
agong81 [20k?\]: This first move was a misclick.  I meant G3

RS: Usually it is recommended to approach W in the upper left so he cannot get a corner enclosure; somewhere around c14/15, d14/15.]
;W[kq]C[maboon [17k?\]: hi];B[nq]C[RS: Good. From the correct direction.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[hp]C[RS: Along traditional thinking, W is now a bit overconcentrated.]

(;B[dq]C[RS: See variation. This seems to me to be from the wrong side.]
;W[cp];B[co]C[agong81 [20k?\]: All through this I felt clumsy blocking white;s kakari]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[bo];B[cj]C[RS: I think you should have played c6. Now W can use this to pressure you.]
;W[cl]
(;B[bl]C[RS: See variation.];W[ck];B[bk];W[cn]C[RS: Since your b9 group is weak you should strengthen it at c13 or d10. You can ignore Wc6 and still live. See variation.]

C[agong81 [20k?\]: Wasn't sure what to do with this ko fight so I went for a big move elsewhere.

RS: I see little point in fighting this ko. W can win it to easy. In any case, there's a saying, "There are no ko threats in the beginning." Meaning either side can ignore a ko threat and make it up later. One of the points of a ko fight is to make the ko threat greater then the ko fight so that if the theat is ignored and the ko filled, you will come out ahead.]

(;B[nn]C[agong81 [20k?\]: For the next several moves I was trying to surround white in the lower right corner.
agong81 [20k?\]: It seems like he overplayed badly by trying to invade even after I had strong walls on O234 and 10PQRS

RS: Yes, W overplayed, but here I would not be sure I could capture W, so I would connect my stones at p3. You would be alive for sure, but W would have 2 very weak groups. While hasseling these 2 groups, you could also hassle W's bottom center group.]

;W[pl];B[qm];W[om];B[lo]C[agong81 [20k?\]: M5 worked really well.  He never responded well.

RS: m5 worked only because W did not respond well. I would've moved either m7 or m8.]

(;W[mk];B[ll];W[lm];B[lk];W[mj]C[RS: Also here, W should've played L6 or L7.]
;B[lj];W[ni];B[km];W[oq]C[agong81 [20k?\]: By this point I was pretty sure I had white captured. It helped a lot that he kept trying to save the group.]
