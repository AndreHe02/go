C[Was white making mistakes in direction or
taking tactical losses or bad tenukis or?

Hello,

I reviewed your game and added some comments (preceded by "ug"). I hope they are helpful for you.

;W[dj];B[ic];W[gc];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[ch]
(;W[ci]C[ug: This looks like bad shape, since it leaves a weakness at C9.]
;B[dh];W[cn];B[po]C[ug: I think that this is too small. I would have played at F3, or around M16.]
;W[hq]
(;B[cq]C[ug: See the variation for an alternative for black.]
;W[dq]
(;B[bp]C[ug: See the variation for the standard sequence.]
(;W[bo]C[ug: Maybe C2 instead is even more severe.]
(;B[br];W[dr];B[aq];W[cr];B[jo];W[cp]C[ug: White should choose a more active way to defend his weakness here.]
;B[kd];W[lq];B[kp]C[ug: I'm not sure what the best way to deal with this invasion is. M5 instead of L4 is one possibility. L4 doesn't look bad, either, though.]
;W[mo];B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[ll];W[om];B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[mq]C[ug: Very bad. Instead, black should try to set up a splitting attack between the two white groups.]
;W[nq];B[mr];W[oq]C[ug: Good!];B[pr];W[lr]C[I think white is slightly ahead.

ug: Yes, white is definitely ahead now. The invasion at M3 was very successful.]
;B[kr];W[nr];B[ec]
(;W[ed]C[ug: Maybe W can D15 first, and capture the black invader. See the variation.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gb];W[dc];B[eb];W[gd];B[db]
(;W[cb]C[ug: Too small. White should run into the center, and at the same time attack black's C15 group which is pretty weak now.]
;B[fh]C[ug: Now it becomes very clear that C18 was the wrong direction of play.]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[id];B[jc];W[df];B[cf];W[eg];B[eh];W[ho];B[fg]
;W[ff];B[de];W[ef];B[bd]
(;W[ac]C[ug: This move is completely unnecessary. White has exactly one eye in the corner regardless of this move, so this is almost like passing. I think white is still ahead, but he lost much of his lead by now.]
;B[ih];W[hf];B[hg]
(;W[if]C[ug: As far as I can see, white is alive without this move, and should tenuki instead.]
;B[md];W[re];B[rd];W[qe]C[ug: Probably S7 is larger.];B[rk]
;W[rj];B[qk];W[qm];B[rm];W[pn];B[qo];W[oo];B[gn]
(;W[go]C[ug: H6 instead might be better, since it will be much harder for black to get any territory in the center.]
;B[fn];W[em];B[fl];W[el]C[Looks like black caught up in the last 50
moves.

ug: Yes. The main reasons are white's moves at C18 and A17.]
;B[hn];W[sd];B[li];W[fk]C[ug: Since you don't follow up on T16, we see that T16 was too small - not really sente at this point.]

(;B[cg]C[ug: This was a strange sequence. B13 just gave a prisoner to black. And I think that C13 is not actually necessary - see the variation.]
;W[ad];B[ae];W[ql];B[rl];W[sk]C[ug: Much too small.];B[ir];W[hr]

ug: I count black ahead by about 2 pts. So it is quite close now, but probably there is no chance to win this game for white any more. (See the variation.)]
