C[Hello,

I think I played a pretty good game, and saw several mistakes that Cerga made.  and yet I lost.   I am not sure why.

any advice would be great.

A : I'm Andre, i'll do my best in reviewing your game

Basic principles :
1. Play for bigger points as always.
2. At opening sequence, enclose corner first then proceed to side then centre. But don't focus on corner too much. 2 or 3 corner is enough
3. Create a balance between territory and influence
4. Avoid touching your opponents stone. Touching makes both side stronger. Only touch when you are weak, if you have more than 1 choice in touching your opponent's stone, choose the strongest so that if it gets stronger, no big difference because it's already strong enough
5. In fight sequence focus on killing your enemy's stone or at least making it overconcentrated.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[dp];W[cn];B[fq]
(;W[cp]C[A: This is white's mistake
touching makes both sides stronger, in this case, white's position is not weak, this helped black gain strength at lower left corner]
;B[cq];W[co]
(;B[ep]TR[fc][gc][fd][cf][df][qh][ci][oo][qo][np]C[A:
This move is small, black's group does not need enforcement. See variation

I recommend playing at other corners, see marked spot.];W[op]
LB[np:1][nq:2]C[A:
This move is small too, usually white plays at O4 and black might respond by playing at O3 and taisha joseki develops]
;B[oq];W[np];B[qp]
(;W[ro]C[A: This is a mistake by white too, O3 is bigger. See variation]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[rp]C[This move is for protecting corner. but white can tenuki for bigger points]

(;W[rn]C[Only 4 points worth, this is white's mistake, white can tenuki for bigger points]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq]TR[dd][cn][qn]SQ[pd]C[I knew he was getting good thickness, but I liked the teritory, and figured I could get thickness above.

A: take a look at the big picture!
A lonely black stone is being seperated from his comrades

White has framework to create a huge moyo by attacking this lonely black stone. Black MUST invade NOW!]
;W[lp];B[jq]
(;W[pj]C[A: Too small, white can get more];B[qg]LB[gc:A][df:B]
[cg:C][ci:F][di:D][dj:E]SQ[mj]C[I  generaly like this move, but here I don't think it was very strong.  any better suggestions?

A:
I think this move is good, whis weakened white's position after he made a mistake by playing at Q10. Remember : a move at 4th line s for influence not territory so white loses many territory because of this move

now white has several choice, 1. defend the available territory
2. proceed his plan and take center area
3. Tenuki and play at other spot

1 gives white 15 points
2 gives white 18 points secure territory and huge influences
3 unpredictable, white may play at marked spot but the result is unpredictable

I prefer 2 and this can be achieved by playing at O10];W[ri]
C[A: White choses the smallest among 3 choices];B[fc]
(;W[df]TR[fc]SQ[jc]C[A: I think a hasame at K17 is better. Black's upper right corner territory is not secured and still can be attacked while attacking F17 stone at the same time]
;B[jc];W[oc]
(;B[nd]TR[pc]C[A:
This move gives white a chance to build his base. Black should play at Q17]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[nc];B[md];W[qc]C[A: now white's based settled]
;B[dj]C[as soon as I made that move I wished I had made one with room for a four stone extention.

A:This move is better at D10, white's position at D16 and D14 is not suitable for securing territory]
;W[dl]C[A : white intended to cut black's connection with lower left corner. But he forgot that his upper left corner is weak]
;B[cg]
(;W[cf]C[A : this move is too weak, see variation];B[eg]TR[dg]
C[A : And this move is weak too. Better at D13];W[dg];B[dh]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi];W[bg]
(;B[cl]TR[ek]C[A : This move is small, take the influence (bigger points). I recomend playing at E9. See Variation]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[bl];B[el];W[dm];B[em]C[here I was trying to connect, but was worried that my thickness had some weakness.]
;W[eh]C[as I was afraid of...]
(;B[fg]C[A :
This move is a mistake, black got seperated from his other group and white may invade to black's potential.]
;W[di]
(;B[cj]C[A: this is a mistake, black should abandon C11&B11 stone to secure more potential, see variation]
;W[bk];B[ei];W[dh];B[fi];W[fh]
(;B[gi]C[A :  A mistake, black lets his group to be seperated, he must fight!]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hf];W[hi];B[ig];W[hh];B[ee];W[ef];B[fe]
;W[ff];B[gf]
(;W[dc]C[A : Small!, better at L11];B[mc]C[N17 and k4 had been calling to me for some time. I finally took one of them.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[pe];W[rf];B[qf];W[se]
(;B[qe]C[A: Black too afraid to fight for ko, he has some potential to win this ko fight, he can play at S17 and R13 to win this ko fight.

This ko fight worth about 16 points but with this ko fight black can win some territory]
;W[rc]
(;B[mh]C[here I was trying to break into the middle.  This seems to direct though.  Any better ways to do this?

A : by doing this move, black tries to attack while protecting his own, but because white's possible area is bigger thyan black's, black should trade his trritory for white's destruction, see variation]
;W[ge]C[A WHite's mistake, his area at center is bigger and treathen by black, black should tenuki and attack white's area, by playing at N9]

(;B[he];W[gd];B[fd];W[mj];B[hj];W[jh]TR[ji][jk]C[A : This move is weak, better at L11, but the pur pose is unclear, better at K9 to secure some territory]
;B[ij];W[io];B[jp];W[jo];B[hp];W[ho];B[go]TR[kl]C[A : What did black expect to gain here ? these 2 white groups is strong enough and doesn't need connection and so isblack's E8 group. This move is better at L8 to destroy white's moyo]
;W[ip]C[A : this move is 16 poibts worth and can be ignored for white's 20 points destruction at L8]
;B[iq];W[gp];B[hq];W[gn];B[fo];W[gm]C[A : What is the purpose of this move ? it's better to play at L8]

(;W[jm]C[A :
I consider this point as a start for endgame moves.
The important thing during endgame moves are :
1. Play at big points as always and try not to lose sente if you already have it or gain sente if you don't. Use your sente to squeeze your opponent
2. Ensure connection between groups
3.  Avoid playing at dame points until there are no other spot unless you play at dame point]
;B[bp]C[I was looking for a way to kill white in the bottome left, since he only had 1 eye.  I figured I would start with a hane.

A : WHite has nice shape and already has one eye. It's impossible to kill]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[ap]TR[im][mq]C[Small, better at J7 or N3];B[aq]
;W[ao];B[bm]C[I played through this a lot and discovered that b7 was a mistake.  I don't think there is anyway to kill hime after white a5.]
