C[exswoo[9k\]:Hi, I'll be reviewing your game this time around.  I'll keep only to the basics since I think that's what will help you out the most at your level.

Also, I think the person you were playing against is much stronger than you are so you shouldn't feel too discouraged  by the fact that you've lost...but this game does make it hard for me to point out how you should've played since it didn't really go on too long.]

;W[po]TR[pd]C[-taking the corner is more common, although this is playable.]
;B[oq];W[op]LB[pl:C][qp:A][qq:B]C[-I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with your move.  It doesn't put much pressure on black.  If you really wanted to play a diagonal move, I would play A since you can assume a response at B.

Overall I think creating a base with a move like C is more important though.]

A)Avoid empty trianges!

B)Don't be afraid to make jumps!

C)Stop playing right next to your opponent's stones.  That is a very offensive move and will often lead to you losing out if you dont have friendly stones near by...which you often didn't in this game.]
