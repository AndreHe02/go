GC[This game was played on the Kiseido Go server, and is probably the
best game I've had where I felt my weaknesses showed through clearly.
I played white, and lost by 16.5 stones (it would have been 11.5 with the
usual 5.5 stones byo-omi).

I often find my opponents get much larger moyos than me in the
early phases of the game, leaving me to make up ground in the middle
game by fighting.  This works fine with players who're weak, and I
sometimes steal back a lot of territory, but this is obviously untenable
against players who're of a similar standard.  Perhaps in this game it
was made worse by me playing white (which I rarely do!).

Any comments or advice would be hugely appreciated. Although I've
played a lot of games (and studied problems, joseki, etc) I think my
improvement has stopped.

- you should work on your life and death and invasion techniques. although u were able to make 2 living groups inside of B's territories, those groups were alive because of black's mistakes. your priorities are localized - you focus on getting territory (even if it is small pieces) while your opponent spreads his stones strategically across the board and forms a lot of potential. you want to prevent the opponent from doing that, otherwise you will fall behind.]
