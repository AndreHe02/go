;B[do]C[i play on the 5.4 , because i dislike the symmetric ones like sansan or hoshi

As long as you are familiar with how to work with this move than this is fine.]
;W[dd];B[oq]C[this time 5.4 to get not too aggressive

Both of these moves leave the corners rather open.  This could be a good way to entice white into invading these corners so you can have a game with lots of fighting.  Even if that isn't your plan, you should have some sort of plan.  The more unusual your moves, the more carefully thought out your plan should be.

You do have one stone on the 3rd line and one on the 4th line. In general, good opening play involves moves on the 3rd and 4th lines almost exclusively, with about half of the moves on each line.]
;W[pd];B[dq]C[a on point jump shimari aiming for l4 or l3

Eventually, playing around L4 is good, but for the opening you need to spread your stones around the whole board.]
;W[po];B[kq]TR[pj][qf][cf]SQ[fc][nc][jd]C[i chose l3 because of the approach at q5

hope to get double wing formation

At this point, white has stones in 3 corners and black has stones in only 2 corners.  Black's stones are too close together for the opening.  Any of the squares would be better for spreading things around.
During the opening, a good rule of thumb is to find the bigges gap between stones and play in that gap.  At this point, the biggest gap is between white's two top corner stones, so I would say the squares are best.  The moves marked with triangles are also better than playing at L3.]
;W[pq];B[nq]SQ[np]C[I like O4 here.  O4 is still connected to P3 but gives black more room.  I think P4 is too close to white's strong stones at Q3 and Q5.  P2 makes a very low group with little chance of influencing the rest of the board.  Plus, P2 violates out rule of thumb to play opening moves only on the  3rd or 4th lines. (it is a rule of thumb, meaning there are times you should violate it, but not without careful thought)]
;W[pr]C[This is small for the opening.  White's corner is already pretty secure, so this doesn't add much.  You are correct to ignore it and play elsewhere for now.]
;B[cf]C[approach move - hope that the opponent does not pincer

This is fine.];W[ce];B[ci]TR[df]SQ[cf]C[2 point jump to extend. longest possible.

bigger play elsewhere maybe on the top or right?

Right now, the marked stone needs some support, so playing D14 is better than jumping away.  The two white stones in the top left count as a single group since black can't seperate them. So, we have a single black stone in contact with a group of 2 strong stones.  This is a contact fight.  Once a contact fight has been started by either player, you need to continue it until all of your groups of stones have 5 or more liberties.  Right now, your black stone has 3 liberties.  If you play D14 now, you will have a 2 stone group with 5 liberties.  If white doesn't fill in one of those liberties with his move, then you can play somewhere else on your next turn.]
;W[df]C[See how much stronger white is compared to how this would look with a black stone on D14.

Another good rule of thumb is to figure out where your opponent would like to play a stone and play there yourself first.  So, if you could predict that white would want to play D14, then you should consider playing there yourself.]
;B[cg]C[This is a good contact fight response.  Your group went from 2 liberties to 4 with this play.  You still need to get to 5 or more before you are done here and can move on.]
;W[dg]
(;B[ch]SQ[dh]C[i think that mov is too defensive, variation would have been better to gain access to center on left side and to connect to lower left

i include only one main variation, because i am still not good a the direction of play

I think that D12 is better than C12.  With a stone at D12, all four of black's stones would be considered 1 group.  White would have to play on C12 to seperate these stones and that would put white's cutting stone into Atari, so white won't cut.  Diagonal plays make better potential eye shape.  Later in the game, this group is almost killed.  Setting up better potential eye space now would have made the fighter later in the game much easier for black.]
;W[jj]C[Both groups now have more than 5 eyes, so it is time to stop the contact fight and play somewhere else.]
;B[qf];W[qe];B[qj]C[This is too far to jummp from your R14 stone.  They can be seperated too easily.  
Again, this is a new contact fight and you need to continue making contact plays until your groups all have 5 or more liberties. Q14 is good but Q13 could be considered as well.]
;W[qh]C[White takes advantage of black's too-large gap.  When deciding where to play, spend a moment looking at the result from your opponent's point of view.  If you were white, wouldn't you want to play between these two black stones?  If the answer is yes, then you need to rethink your move.]

(;B[ph]SQ[oi][oh][og]C[This is a new contact fight when there is still another unfinished contact fight.

You don't kill stones by playing contact.  You kill stones by surrounding them with about a 1 space gap.  So, the squares are all possibilites if you want to try killing this stone.

I wouldn't try to kill the stone, however.  You can usually get more benefit from harassing and threatening your opponent's weak groups than you can by trying to kill them.  If you try to kill and fail, you have wasted a lot of effort.  If you harrass a group, your opponent will spend a lot of effort just defending it while you are building up nearby areas.  Plus, if you opponent makes an error, you may be able to kill the stones and still get the other benefits.
See the variation for an example of what I mean.];W[qg];B[pg]
;W[rf];B[pf];W[qi]C[This is a bad move by white.  Running into an opponent's stone like this is almost never a good idea.  Before this move, the two white stones had 3 liberties.  After black's response, the three stones still have just 3 liberties.  So there is not significant gain for white.  Meanwhile, black gets a better wall.
In the end these three white stones get captured, which just helps prove that this move does little to strengthen white's positon.]
;B[pi];W[rj];B[qk]SQ[pj]C[Playing at the square would settle black's stones and make a nice wall.  
With this move, there is still a potential cutting point.];W[rk]
;B[nj]TR[qk][qj]SQ[pi][ph][pg][pf][qf]C[This is still a contact fight.  The group marked with squares has 5 or more liberties as is.  The two stones marked with triangles have only three liberties, so the contact fight is not finished. Black could push along the third line and hope that white will continue to crawl along the second line.  Black would need at least 2 more stones to get enough liberties for this group.
Black could also connect these two groups, since the resulting group would have more than enough liberties.  This move does connect the groups, but only until white plays a ladder-breaker on the top.  This move makes maintaining the connection very complicated.  A simple connection at P10 would be better.  See the variation starting next turn.]

(;W[ql]C[See the variation for what happens if white tries to cut now.]
;B[pl]SQ[ok]C[P9 is a good option to consider here.];W[qm];B[ol]
C[This is pretty good shape and black should be able to make an eye around Q10 eventually.]
;W[pm];B[lh]SQ[jc]C[It is time to play elsewhere since black's side group is secure for now.  This move is a bit small, however.  The area around K17 still looks wide open.]
;W[hi];B[ic]C[Good];W[gc];B[nc]C[This is rather far to jump from a single stone.  White could play around L17 and has a good chance of killing the J17 stone since there is nowhere for it to run.  If white does this, however, black gets to reduce white's territory in the top right corner. So, you are probably safe in assuming that white will defend the corner, but that is not a sure thing.]
;W[oc]C[White likes starting contact fights.];B[mc]SQ[nd]C[Playing at the square helps connect to black's right side group better.  Either move is an acceptable response in a contact fight, but only O16 does another job (connecting) at the same time.]
;W[ne]C[This starts to seperate black's two groups.]
(;B[ob]SQ[me]C[This is small.  You will eventually have to connect at O18, so this move is Gote.  N15 is better.  See the variation.]
;W[pb];B[nf];W[oe];B[of];W[pe];B[re]C[lol@this one i never thought it would work ;)

I was about to make a comment about useless this move was, but then it worked ;)]
;W[rd];B[rg];W[se];B[ri];W[sg];B[rh]SQ[pk][qh]C[This also makes black's group completely alive since you should be able to make an eye near each of the squares.]
;W[rl];B[me]SQ[mc][nc][ob][ic]C[at this point i had no idea where to play so i chose to connect those two groups

If you have no idea what to do, then pause and look over the whole board.  making a rough count of the score is also helpful. For a rough count, look at the live groups and count to the nearest multiple of five.  
White has about 20 points in the lower right corner, 10 in the upper right, and 20 in the upper left for a total of 50.
Black has about 10 points in the right side, 15 in the lower left, 5 on the left side, 5 on the top and 5 on the bottom for a total of 40.  Black has more potential to make territory around H2 and B8.  So, overall, the game is close.

Connecting groups is useful if it strengthens one or both of them.  If both groups are already completely alive, then connecting them doesn't accomplish much.  So, if you think that the marked group at the top is weak, then connecting is a good idea.  If you think that the marked group is safe, the you should play somewhere that gains more territory.  Playing around D8 or K4 secures more territory than the current move.

Similarly, seperating two of your opponents groups is only useful when one or both are weak.]
;W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[mf]C[This is a nice solid move to connect the two groups.]
;W[dh];B[lj]TR[ie][ko][ip]SQ[di]C[Turning in front of White at D11 is big.  With a black stone here, the whole area around C8 starts to look like black territory. With a white stone at D11, this is a lot less certain.

The current stone at M10 expands black's territory by only 1 or 2 points, so there are several options worth more.  
The triangles are also good choices.];W[no];B[mm]SQ[di][ko]
[ip][ie]C[This doesn't expand black's territory much.  Black's right side group is alive, so you don't need to connect it to anything. White's lower right corner group is also alive, so trying to cut it off from the rest of the board doesn't threaten it.

The squares are all still good options.];W[lo];B[kl];W[il];B[ip]
C[Good];W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[go]TR[io][ip]SQ[lj][kl][mm]C[Good, with three moves (triangles), black has turned the empty area around G3 into about 20 points of territory.  In contrast, the previous 3 black moves (squares) gained about 6 points.

The last several white moves haven't really made any territory for white, so black is pulling into the lead.]
;W[gm];B[fn]SQ[dm]C[Around the square is better.  Black's area around G3 is more secure than the C8 area is.  So, defending around the square is better.
If you like to pick out a single move and call it "the losing move" then I vote for this one.  From here, white moves all the way to the left side.  This cuts off and almost kills the group at C12.  This also means that black gets no territory around C8 while white does get territory aroundF10.
I think that calling a single move "the losing move" over simplifes things too much, so I don't generally use the term.  This is still a bad move no matter what we call it.]
;W[fm];B[em]C[You should block at D7.  Contact is not good for surrounding stones.]
;W[el];B[dm]C[Good, playing at D8 now would leave too many cutting points.]

;W[gn];B[fo];W[hn]C[Now black has Sente and should pause to look at the whole board. White has about 20 points in the lower right, 10 points in the upper right, 20 points around F10, and 20 in the upper left for a total of 70.  Black has about 10 points on the top, 20 around O10, and 40 in the lower left for a total of 70.  So, the game is still close.  Most of the board is already claimed.  Neither side has weak stones to attack.  The largest unclaimed area is around H14, so this is a good place to focus on.

Black did play in this area, but I just wanted to walk you through the sort of thought processes you should be considering at this time.]

For most players, this would be time to stop.  A single digit kyu player would be very annoyed by someone wasting time with the sort of moves that make up the rest of the game.  With both players around 25 kyu, it isn't necessarily bad to try these sorts of moves, however.]

[gj][gi][ej][ei][eh][fh]SQ[jm][kn][lp]C[A lot of black's recent moves inside white's area don't really have much chance to do any good.  Since this is a high kyu game, it is probably worth trying since white might mess up and let black kill something.  As long a white responds to each of your moves, the score doesn't change.

Even a 25 kyu should ignore this move.  The left side of white's stones here have 4 eyes around B9.  The right side of white's stones here have 3 eyes at the squares.  So, there is nothing black can kill in here.  The only other thing black could hope for is to make a live group inside white's area.  If white allows black to play on all of the triangles, then black will be alive. It will only take 1 move for white to destroy one of the eyes and kill the black group.  So, white can ignore several moves here before a response is required.]
