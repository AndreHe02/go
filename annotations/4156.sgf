C[I was quite satisfied with the game. At one point, I had to make a deep invasion; it survived, but in the end I lost by quite a lot anyway.  I am not quite sure where the things went wrong.  Thanks in advance for the review. - Rakdver

Hi,

My name is Ruben Cornelissen (Kurippular) I am from Holland, and I am the reviewer for this game. I recently got promoted to 2dan, and I hope my comments will be of any help. I also made comments on some Black moves, these comments may be useful to you as well.]

(;B[fp]C[This seemed like a quite bad choice to me; after the double hane that follows, I had whole corner and influence on left.

Black makes a bad mistake here. See variation.];W[dn];B[en]
;W[em]C[Very good moves]
(;B[fn];W[dm];B[fm]
(;W[ek]C[I should have probably played something like P4 instead.

Yes, a splitting play on the lower side seems better, and even if you don't play E9, there are no severe things Black can do on the left side.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pj]C[Later, I wished I had played this on the third line; however, I wanted to play a bit more to the center, so that the bottom moyo does not get out of control.

Like you said, playing on the third line is better here. On the 3rd line it is easier to make a base. I think you may be too afraid of a Black moyo.]
;B[ql]C[Good move, showing why playing on the 4th line was a mistake]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]
(;W[pl]C[I thought about either closing the upper left corner, or playing around k17 now, but I decided to try to limit the moyo at the bottom first.  The following sequence however does not seem to work very well -- I strengthened blacks corner and did not achieve much.

After the game, I considered o7, but black will split then and my group around r17 gets quite weak.  Maybe something like j7?

Things like O7 and J7 are interesting, but not when you have a weak group on the board. Reinforcing it is most important, so the idea of Q8 is good. However, it strengthens Black's corner, so it is probably not the right move here. See variation]
;B[pm];W[ol]
(;B[om];W[qk];B[rl]SQ[nl]C[Nobi is very big, else Black will play double hane]

(;W[ed];B[gc];W[ic]C[After game, I considered g15 instead, black will play e18 and k17 then and I could build some moyo on left and in center; however I think it would be still better for black that way.

G15 gives away a lot of cash, so you must only play this way when you expect to make more in the centre. J17 seems logical to me.]
;B[ge]
(;W[ie]C[Perhaps m17 instead?

See variation];B[kc]
(;W[hd]C[This peep makes Black stronger, and should not be played. You probably played it so Black couldn't connect, but then you should play it after he tries to connect.

See variation];B[fc]C[Black should just connect, this strengthens White corner a lot.]
;W[ec];B[ff]C[Very bad shape. The only moves possible here are F15 and E15, and in this case F15 seems best.]

(;W[ee]C[You missed a big opportunity here.

See variation];B[fe];W[eg];B[ef];W[df]C[Vulgar and blunt play by Black. Don't push when you don't cut afterwards.]
;B[fg];W[eh];B[ig]
(;W[oc]C[I did not quite know what to do about the j16 group; running with it does not seem very appealing to me, so I decided to just give it up.

The group is too big to sacrifice, so running is the only option. Black is not very strong either, so he will have to run with you]

C[This is more than enough for Black]
(;W[gr]C[my group around r12 is quite weak now, so perhaps jumping with it to the center would be better.  However, I feared that the bottom area is too big, and I did not want to give black chance to strengthen it.

In my opinion, the R12 group is not very weak anymore. Invading makes sense.

See variation];B[fr];W[jq];B[lr]C[Now White has no eyes. Therefore I prefer playing as in the variations, that is, trying to settle a group there quickly.]

Summary:

In the opening, you had a lead after Black's mistake on the left side. But after the high invasion Black got the initiative, and after he caught the upper side stones he was ahead a lot. Your endgame was ok, this is not where you lost the game.
