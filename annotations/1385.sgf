RE[B+Resign]

;B[qd]C[Comments by Ryan];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[od];W[qj];B[qh]
LB[ql:a][ol:b]C[Better at 'a' since you want to drive white towards your thickness. Playing here makes some points, but lets white off far too easily. After 'a' black can aim at 'b' next to build a framework]
;W[qn];B[ql]LB[qp:a][po:b]C[This seems overly agressive to me without first having a stone at 'a'. With a stone at 'a' you are guarenteed a good connection between your invading stone and a base, as it happened black was forced in to a very low position.

Therefore 'a' seems better since it secures the corner and sets up for this move. 'b' might also be possible, though I wouldn't recomend it since it makes the white extension ideal]
;W[pl]LB[qk:a][pm:b]C[Black played at 'a', but he should play 'b'. See variation]

(;B[qk];W[pk];B[rj];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph]LB[pg:a]C[Better to play at 'a' without giving atari since that makes whites shape stronger. Of course, if white doesn't answer black next has a double atari]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[pg];W[oi];B[qg];W[og];B[jp]LB[nq:a]C[This is okay, but the next natural move for white would be the splitting attack at 'a', so perhaps it would be good to play closer]
;W[qm]C[This is a very slow move for white akin to passing, black can play anywhere he wants]
;B[mq];W[fc];B[jj]LB[pm:a]C[This is okay, but black could also aim at the cut at 'a' since the last move acts as a ladder breaker. Playing tengen here is a little vague]
;W[cm]LB[dl:a]C[Since black doesn't have enough space for a 2-space extension on the side, the shoulder hit of 'a' might be better than invading. The goal of 'a' is limit how much terroritory white can build without endangering any of blacks stones.

Black is ahead in the balance of terroritory, and regardless of which way white answers 'a', white cannot hope to gain too much. See variation for blacks next move at 'a']

(;B[ci]C[If black wants to play on the side, this is the best spot]
;W[cg];B[ck]LB[ei:a][eg:b][el:c]C[Black doesn't need to make a base here, and the extension is cramped anyway. 'a' is a more natural move, extending towards the friendly stone in the center. Trying to make a base gives white 'b' or 'c' potentially to menace the stones while building up his own area of influence]
;W[eq]LB[dq:a]C[White should have played at 'a'];B[fj];W[em]
;B[jd]LB[jc:a]TR[fc]C[Because of the marked white stone, this move would be more effective on the 3rd line at 'a']
;W[hc];B[lc]TR[jd]C[Hard to see what the marked stone is accomplishing now]

;W[ms];B[ho]C[It is unfortunate, but there was no way to stop white from living. Black's original extension was loose, so black should have defended it before now since it is difficult to use the thickness adequately]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[ro];B[rr];W[sp];B[oo];W[nn];B[pr]
;B[dc]LB[ed:a]C[Unreasonable move by black. 'a' might have been more reasonable (see variation)]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[ed]TR[hc]C[With the marked stone, it would require a major mistake by white for black to live]

;B[je];W[ic];B[he]LB[hd:a][bl:b][er:c]C['a' worth 1 more point, though black should really just play elsewhere such as 'b' or 'c']
;W[bl];B[kb]LB[er:a]C['a' bigger since this is only 4-6 points at best]
;W[ib];B[cq]C[This is a bit much.];W[dr];B[cr];W[gs]LB[cp:a]
[bo:b]C[White should have played 'a' and killed you, black gets free reign with this move. 'b' is the natural followup to make a base]
;B[dq];W[fr];B[ds]LB[bo:a]C[Pointless. Black wants to extend upwards to make eyespace]
;W[er];B[cp];W[bo];B[do];W[ep];B[co];W[bp];B[eo];W[fo];B[fp]
LB[fn:a]TR[im][in][io][ip]C[If white plays 'a' black is dead. This is reckless since the white stones are dead, but have aji. Black is massively ahead, black should play simply and wind up the game]
;W[gp];B[hp]LB[fq:a]C[Should be 'a', the stones can't directly get out. 'a' is also sente]
;W[fn];B[dm];W[dl];B[dn];W[el];B[cl];W[bn]LB[fq:a]C[Because 'a' is sente, black can dispatch with the white stones easily starting at 'a'. See variation]
