C[Nataraj : Hi, my name is Helmut, I am nataraj at IGS, I play black here. I would appreciate your comments on my game. Obviously, both myself and my opponent made some critical mistakes but please point out the (to me) not so obvious weaknesses in our play. It is equally helpful to me whether you show  me why something turned out bad for me or where my opponent could have taken advantage of my blunders. Thank you very much for reviewing!

Gost : I will now review this game from the black side.

On a global view, black made some big mistakes in the direction of play and strategy in the opening, which resulted in white taking a huge lead. Happily for black, white lacked a little in confidence and fighting strength, and did not kill some killable black groups, and black won. Of course, and particularly for beginners, it is quite awkward to review a game that has been won by 30 points, from the winner's side. A lost game should have been submitted, for real progress to be done.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[nq]LB[oq:a]C[Ghost : This corner enclosure (shimari) is too wide and leaves some weaknesses in the corner. A play at 'a' is the usual move.]
;W[ck]C[Ghost : with White 6, White uses a low chinese opening, which is usually used to create big moyos. Therefore, it is probable that black will have to make some invasions later in the game.]
;B[pj]LB[fc:a]C[Ghost : A big point, but perhaps too passive, particularly considering the 'weak' corner enclosure. Approaching at 'a' would be better.]
;W[nc]C[Ghost : White profits from black's passivity and makes a very big approach]
;B[qf]MA[kc][kd][jd][jc]C[Ghost : too passive. Black is now overconcentrated on the right side, and lets white take all the big points. A pincer around the marked locations was the only move.]
;W[jc]LB[ic:a]C[Ghost : A little too cautious from white. 'a' was better]
;B[cf]LB[co:A][do:B][fq:C][jp:D][ci:X][ch:Z]TR[ck]C[Nataraj : At this point I was thinking about A-D, but A and B seemed to be in too tight a spot, C was not much of an attack and D too slow if W anwered somewhere near C. I thought I could either extend to X or invade at the top

Ghost : As it stands, Black is already a lot behing, because of earlier mistakes. The weakest area for white is the bottom. So approaching at 'B' was good. 'A' is a mistake that would result in black living small (if at all) and sealed by white. Black 11 enables white to extend at 'Z' beautifully, using perfectly the marked stone and attacking black.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[ch]LB[fd:a][fc:b][ec:c][cc:d]C[Nataraj : what is the proper response here?

Ghost : White 14 is a mistake. It should have been played at 'a' or 'b'. Now, white can play 'c' with the idea of 'd' later. White will have to be carefull about getting out / living, and in either case, white's territory is lost in the corner.]
;B[fe];W[fc];B[ee]C[Ghost : this accomplishes nothing but allow white to claim the corner safely.]
;W[hd];B[eg]LB[dh:a]TR[cf][df]C[since I have no base make some eye space - maybe too soon?

Ghost : Black lost 5 moves in a row in the opening to make a small group that attacks no stone and makes no territory. If black was scared about his marked group living, a simple move at 'a' would have been enough. White can be pretty happy with the result.]
;W[ei]C[Ghost : since after since sequence, black's group is not even safe, white can build influence and make territory by attacking black]
;B[co]LB[gf:a][do:b]C[Ghost : a mistake. A white move at 'a' can probably kill or at least seriously menace black's group. And the approach should be at 'b'.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[cm]LB[gq:a]C[Ghost : weak. 'a' was better for white]
;B[fq]TR[do][co]C[now I have more of an attack

Ghost : You must not forget that you don't attack for the pleasure of it. You must always gain something, wheter it is territory, influence, or just kill some groups. In this situation, the correct idea would be to sacrifice the triangle marked stone when attacking white's corner group, and use the circled stone to build a big moyo on the bottom.]
;W[ep];B[eo]TR[fq]C[decide to give up F3 rather than the E5 group

Ghost : a mistake. Even if your 3 stones get out, they have zero value. the bottom stone was usefull to make territory. Remember, the aim is to have more territory than the other, not more stones.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[jp];W[hq]TR[go]MA[co][do][eo][fo]C[this was maybe lucky, could have separated my groups at G5, no?

Ghost : Indeed. And black would have lost his marked stones]
;B[ho]LB[go:a][fl:b]C[try to connect

Ghost: this does not connect anything. The cut at 'a' is still possible. Playing 'a' or 'b' to get out was correct]
;W[ip]C[Ghost : a mistake, should have cut];B[io];W[jq];B[kp]
;W[go];B[fm]C[escape to center and attack left side

Ghost : no. you don't attack anything with this. You have to be realistic. White's groups are all safe. Your group is the one under attack : if you get out safely and leave, you can be happy.]
;W[hp]C[Ghost : useless.];B[gn]TR[fo][eo][do][co][fm]C[now i feel my F5 group will live one way or another

Ghost : Now it lives, but only because white made some mistakes.]
;W[hn];B[in]C[I think I can make some territory on the right by following white]
;W[hm];B[gm];W[hl];B[gk]LB[jl:a][gl:b][fl:c][fk:d]C[try to keep W separated

Ghost : White can play at 'a' and fight. Black's shape is bad. White can play 'b', black 'c' and white can cut at 'd'. Then black is in trouble]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[hk];B[fk]C[Ghost : a mistake. White should have been more confident and cut like specified before]
;W[hi]LB[jl:a]TR[gk][fk][fl][fm][gm][gn][fo][eo][do][co]C[Ghost : too linear. 'a' was the key move for shape, attacking power, and invading black's moyo. As a consequence, a play around this is good for Black. On the other hand, Black's group on the left (marked stones) is under attack and has to live now (2 eyes)]

;B[gh];W[fg];B[gg];W[dj]LB[ek:a]TR[gk][fk][fl][fm][gm][gn][fo]
[eo][do][co]C[Ghost : big mistake. White should have played 'a' to kill Black 's marked stones.]
;B[ek];W[ci];B[dg];W[im];B[jn]LB[jm:X]C[I did not dare the hane at X

Ghost : you should have.];W[jm];B[kn];W[lm];B[km];W[kl];B[ll]
;W[lk];B[ml];W[mk];B[nl];W[nk];B[ok];W[oh]C[Ghost : this fight was messy on white's part. It enabled black to build huge territory worth a lot more than white's center, when white's group was not really threatened. Also, the moves were slow on both sides. Only 1 point jumps and connections were made. Both players should create more volume by playing a little wider.]
;B[of]LB[cc:a][oc:b]C[Ghost : Slow, slow. Invading the top corner at 'a' and protecting black's corner at 'b' were the strongest moves]
;W[ni];B[qh];W[lr];B[mr];W[me];B[ng]MA[kk][jl]LB[cc:a][oc:b]
[kr:c]C[since there are a few cutting points maybe I can separate some stones. at least reduce the white center

Ghost : the points precised ealier were bigger.
Big points are 'a', 'b', 'c'.];W[mg];B[mf]C[I had read out the sequence as it was actually played so I thought this was safe. was it really safe?]
;W[lf];B[mh];W[nf];B[nh];W[og];B[oi];W[mi]LB[lh:a]C[Ghost : 'a' was correct.]

[qo:c]C[Ghost : 'a' killed white since after 'a', both 'b' and 'c' can be used to destroy white's eye

This is the end of the commentary, the rest of the game is pretty messy.]
;B[sr];W[sp];B[rr]LB[sn:X]C[now I think by playing X instead, I could have killed W. Playing S2 gives W a false eye only?]
