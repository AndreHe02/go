GC[Commentary for GTL given by Steve Fawthrop, AGA 5d.  
Comments prefaced by [SGF\]]

C[This game was playes on the Dragon Go Server, meaning that it went for a little over two months and both of us had a lot of time to think about our moves. We set out when starting the game to comment on all our moves as we played (which is something that the long time limit really facilitates). So the SGF file has a lot of comments, and the best thing about it is that the comments are what we were thinking *at the time*, not what we think now, meaning that they are not blurred by the precision of hindsight.

You'll very rarely find a game between two players as weak as us where so much thought was put into the moves. It seems to me that any mistakes we made were definitely not blunders, which suggests to me a great potential to learn from this game.

By the same token, I think reviewing this game is going to take more effort than usual, because in our comments we raise a lot of questions and issues and make a lot of statements that need considering.

So thanks in advance for your time and effort in reviewing the game.]
;B[pd]C[Ben Bildstein: Well, it's hard to know where to start. I figure it's either 3-4 or 4-4 for me. Generally I play 4-4 as White because I feel it's a little slow to play 3-4. As Black, I'm never sure.

I didn't consider 3-5 or 4-5 because I figure I don't understand 3-4 and 4-4 well enough to start expanding my horizons yet.]
;W[pp]C[John Rae: I don't play 4-5 or 3-5 for similar reasons, I tend to find playing against them not too much of a problem, they go so imediately for one directional influence. I often play for influence but a weakness is sometimes leaving it to latre to invade my opponent's moyo. The 4-5 and 3-5 openings pretty much force me to take that decision earlier so I escape me worst problem.]
;B[dp]C[Ben Bildstein: I don't feel like I understand influence well enough, so I generally think more about territory in the opening. I think perhaps the major problem with this is that I am not very good at reduction, which I think is one of the more important uses of influence.

I didn't expect q4 (or correspondingly d16). It's on a 4-4 point, and so is my first stone, so it can't be an error in direction. I couldn't think of any outstanding way of responding to it, so I decided on d4, thinking that if you play in the last open corner (and I think you should), I can attack one of your stones with support coming from two directions (d4 and q16), which should be pretty good.

[SGF\]  There is nothing wrong with this move at all, but it is somewhat unusual.  The reason is that the original 4-4 is played with a view to making a moyo and is likely to lead to fighting, whereas a diagonal fuseki tends to lead to a slower paced game with less fighting.]
;W[cc]LB[dd:A][nq:B]C[John Rae: d4 seemed unusual to me, d17 or c17 is what I normally play and come across.

Because black is first I don't want to give you 2 corners to appoach so I'm making the top left uninteresting. with a cross fuseki i thinka bit of teritory more worthwhile than influence, it could become a territory gme

[SGF\] I don't like this. It seems to make it too easy for B to make territoriy on whichever side he chooses.  Playing "A" immediately for B, or approaching with a knight's move, all work well.  B can also delay an approach at the top left and play "B", waiting to see how the game develops before committing to the top left.  W could play either D16 (which would lead to an unusual game) or C17.  But perhaps more interesting would be to play at a 5-3 point with the intend of nullifying at least on of the B 4-4's]

(;B[df]C[Ben Bildstein: But I don't want a territorial game.

So I will approach the 3-3 stone already, even though conventional wisdom might suggest that it is less interesting than the bottom right corner (but I really don't know).

Sensei's Library says that Black 5 is "the most common way to approach a 3-3 point, in professional games." If that's the case, and given that the other three corners are all settled for now with stones on 4-4 points, I guess now is an appropriate time to use the high ogeima approach.

So, in summary: Black 5 seems okay locally; All the stones so far are in symmetrical positions in their corners, so no area of the board is clearly the biggest; I played on the 4th line because that's the sort of game I want to play.

[SGF\] The logic seems reasonable and the move i certainly standard.  But considering the whole board you might want to consider a closer approach.  Look at the variation.]
;W[nc]LB[qf:A][pp:B]C[John Rae: Well I expected an appraoch at O3 or R7 since the conventional comment is that C17 is settled.

My first reaction was to play F16 but that seems to ignore the whole point ot playing 3-3 in that corner.

Therefore I decided on an approach move. Ideally I'm hoping to go through a j0oeski following this and come out with sente to go back to the corner.

However that may not happen in which case black will maybe get a double approach to the 3-3 stone which will probably result in some outside influence.

I picked O17 because it will work nicely with F16 should i get the chance to play it. Otherwise it might let me get a position on the top that nullifies any influence black might gain.

Having said all that I suppose I should expect a pincer joseki - so white will get more territory but have to deal with the influence later.

[SGF\] This move makes no sense to me.  First of all, leaving the top left just invites B to continue there and gain a lot of influence.  Second, this is the wrong side.  The 3-3 stone cannot easily be sealed in at the top without giving W a lot so it is not so big.  Approaching at 'A', with the backup of 'B' makes more sense.  See the variations as to what might happen at the top left.]

(;B[lc]LB[jd:A]C[Ben Bildstein: Well, I had to think about time. Two days, I think it's been.

I think my approach in the top left emphasises the left side: I wanted to ignore your approach in the top right and instead surround your stone at 3-3 in the top left, but I couldn't find a way.

Then I wanted to use some joseki that takes sente in the top right, but I couldn't think of one.

Then I decided to pincer, put the only pincer I really feel I know how to use is the one space low pincer.

I think I'm happy for you to jump out into the center, but I don't really know what would happen if we went down that path. I'm also happy for you to jump into the corner, even though I think you get sente that way.

Either way, I think the top will end up uninteresting (settled?), and that the left side will probably end up being where the action happens.

But nothing is for sure in the opening.

[SGF\]  How about a wider pincer?  See variation starting at 'A']
;W[qc]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[John Rae: Well I said I was expecting the pincer so I'm really going with the flow. This seems logical and I like this joseki becasue of the aji sometimes left with the O17 stone if black tries for sente.

If white gets sente I'll have to choose between playing to nullify the outside influence you gain from the joseki or dealing with the left side. I've not really made up my mind yet - somehow it feels more real once I see the joseki stones on the board.

[SGF} This is perfect.  B cannot block at 'A' because this requires and extension to be in place on the right side (otherwise W just plays there and nullfies the influence) so B must block at 'B'.  But then the pincer is too close.  It is not good to play te pincer unless the extension down the side is in place.]
;B[pc]C[Ben Bildstein: I figure I have to block on this side because I have no support on the other side, so if I blocked there my influence could easily be neutralised and my stones might end up heavy.

I sort of expected o15, but for no reason I can think of. r17 is certainly joseki.

I don't think I'm going to try too hard to get sente, because I don't feel there is anything urgent anywhere else.]
;W[qd]C[John Rae: I think that is the right side to block, certainly its wht I expected, for the reasons you say.

I read somewhere a pro say that in a pincer you "always" jump into the corner so I usually do. I'm sure always meant mostly but still...]
;B[pe]C[Ben Bildstein: Hmm. I hadn't heard that, but I suppose I can't imagine it being an obviously bad thing, to jump into the corner.

I've heard that the hane is playable in this joseki, although most joseki dictionaries will say otherwise. In fact, I understand that when this pincer was first played by professionals, the hane was played at this point.]
;W[pb]C[John Rae: Well I've seen people play the hane and often it comes unstuck. What it should do with best play on both sides I'm not sure.

I quite like the white position in this joseki becasue it often turns out quite well - which it shouldn't since its joseki.]
;B[ob]C[Ben Bildstein: Yes, it seems to do okay for White. But I suppose the pincer should be played when Black wants to emphasise the top side, so the influence in a real game should be worth slightly more than the joseki itself would suggest.

If it works well for White generally, it might be because kyu players like us aren't as good at using the influence that Black gets as we are at using the territory that White gets. It makes sense, really - you don't have to be good at using territory, that's the whole point of having it!]
;W[qb]C[John Rae: It all depends whether black uses sente or completes the joseki - both are playable.

The sente could be big here but not completing the joseki leaves intersting aji for white.]
;B[oc]C[Ben Bildstein: (Bildstein:)
With sente, I would probably play something like f17 to try to make a moyo at the top.

But I think the aji is to real/big, so I will probably finish the joseki and leave you with sente.]
;W[qf]C[John Rae: :)  Yes I agree, in this situation I think the aji would really work for me. But sete will let me reduce the effect of your outside wall so I think I'm OK either way.]

(;B[og]LB[ec:A]C[Ben Bildstein: Okay, I think you have sente, but r12 or there-abouts seems very big for Black. In fact, I might take it next move, depending on what you do now. Or, if you go for the honte/proft move of r13, I will have sente to put my thickness to use.

[SGF\]  This is the wrong direction.  Trying to create a moyo here is not good when the top left is so open. B should play 'A'.]
;W[fc]C[John Rae: Yes the thickness is imposing so i don't feel I have time to worry about my top right being enclosed. I think this move is prudent and does a fair bit of cutting into the moyo.

[SGF\] Perfect move.]
(;B[qh]LB[qg:A]C[Ben Bildstein: And now nothing seems urgent, again, so I will take this big point.

[SGF\] Joseki calls for 'A'];W[qg]TR[df]C[John Rae: This makes the group safer and takes a litle territory.

I feel comfortable becasue the top left has reduced black's influence a little.

[SGF\]  These comments are valid.  B has been very slack.  The marked stone is not working with the top right at all.]
;B[ph]LB[qg:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I think closing White into the corner is good for Black. And I think there is still some aji in the gap at r15.

But White has sente now. I suppose the top left corner is now the most interesting part of the board?

[SGF}  Black has taken gote to build a wal facing down the side, but this is immediately nullified by the W star point below.  Had B played the correct point ('A') in the first plae he would have sente.]
;W[ic]LB[di:B][qn:A]C[John Rae: closing in seems good.
My teacher's email classes suggest white's R13 makes things safe in this shape, but we didn't quite get there in the expected order so this may not be correct here.

anyway I think I need to reduce the influence further.

[SGF\] Small.  B is never going to want to play here, for two reasons.  First it is gote for B as it does not threaten the W corner.  Second, it is too close to B's own thickness.  If B is not going to play here, why should W?  Depending on the type of game he wants W should play either 'A' (slow drawn out game) or 'B' (quick fighting game).]

(;B[di]LB[di:B][jp:A]C[Ben Bildstein: Since your move takes territory while neutralising the thickness, I think it is good.

Now a proverb says, play away from thickness, so I will leave the top alone.

But am I thick? I have influence, but ther may be weakness in my position. In fact, I know there is. I think you can cut starting with p14 (but I don't think it's a good idea yet), so perhaps I am not thick and should play there.

Either way, I don't want a pincer against my d14 stone, so I'm protecting it.

Since we're both putting so much thought into our moves, I get the feeling that most of the mistakes in this game are going to be strategic.

[SGF\] B's thinking is correct, but there is an indirect way to prevent the pincer.  A B play at 'A' with threaten an approach to the lower right and, at the same time, create a moyo on the left.  The moyo would reduce the appeal of a W pincer in around 'B'.  See the variation.]
;W[fq]LB[jp:A]C[John Rae: I seriously considered C6 instead, on the basis that the d14/11 stones are high and so potentially chaseable into the centre. However a pincer would have been a very good response.

I agree that your top right is not really thick but also agree it may not yet be the time to do anything there. I see no immediate attack and no huge territory black can gain around the position.

Therefore my decision was really between an appraoch on the D4 stone or a move like r6 - towards your wall facing down the side. Along the bottom seems to offer white more development and since I can't do both at once it seems the only move.

[SGF\]  B is thick all over the board, so W needs to be careful.   The lower right is a single stone with nothing to back it up so this approach naturally invites a pincer around 'A'.  This would not be good for W.  I think a better way is to play directly at 'A' and see how B responds.]

(;B[dn]LB[bf:A][dk:B]C[Ben Bildstein: I'd have played f3. It's the largest open space. r6 would let me have, say, k4, which I think would be too much. The I suppose I'd have pincered, you'd have jumped into the corner.

So here is my response. Now for the question of why I chose here. I also considered pincering, but I'd be giving you a fourth corner, which would make my game rather difficult.

I figure that I am strong in the top right and on the left side, and with a stone in the lower left corner, there should be some strategic principle to guide me in putting pressure on you, but if there is such a principle, I don't know what it is.

[SGF\]  This seems very slow.  The left is not so appealing because it is open at the top right (W can slide to 'A') and also the  gap on the left around 'B' is wide.  B should use his influence to play a center game.]
;W[dr]LB[jp:A]C[John Rae: Yes black has relatively stable positions, although not fully settled I think. My instinct tells me that black is all on the 4th line, which means that either there will be lots of territory to come and/or that white can invade and live on the side.

Well with D6 being high the emphasis is going to be on attacking the bottom side. Q4 can fend for itself at present so I feel the natural thing is D2 and either settle with C3 or J3 depending on your response.

Black has lots more influence, white more territory, should lead to an interesting game from here.

[SGF\]  B is ignoring the stone in the lower right.  This move just gives B an opportunity to creaste more thickness.  If should be played at 'A']

(;B[cq]C[Ben Bildstein: I prefer territory to influence, because I know how to handle it better. But that is probably the case for everyone except the pros. Or perhaps  feel that other people my strength know how to handle my influence better than I do, so I prefer territory. Anyway, it's clear that I can't shy away from the position I'm in at the moment.

c3 because White c3 would undermine my two stones too much. If I had played on the third line instead of d6, I may have considered other moves.

Now I expect j3. I'm sort of happy with this, because it leaves room for a posible Black base on the lower side with o3 and l3.

On another note, in hind-sight I think I should have played j17 instead of 
r12.

[SGF\] B should pincer - looks are the variation.];W[iq]LB[pp:A]
[cq:B]C[John Rae: perhaps yes on J17

 I half thought you might play H3, although I've usually seen that with the stone at C6 not D6. Its a move I quite like and after white C3 black would e3 then f4 making the influence much more imposing.

I've really no option other than J3. It makes a base so nearly all my groups are settled which will leave me free to do something about the influence.

[SGF\]  With strong W groups top and bottom it should be fairly easy for W to control the expansion of B's moyo.  There are no threats against the bottom group so B should probably try to start sealing in at the top before W gets the chance to do something there.  This joseki also strengthens the stone at 'A', making it harder for B to do anything in thew lower right or right side.  This is all because of the B move at 'B'.]

(;B[dd]LB[ed:A]TR[ph][qh]C[Ben Bildstein: I think now's a decent time for this move. I don't think it's aji-keshi because I don't see any other aji in the corner (but perhaps I'm wrong?), and I think it helps to strengthen the Black left-side moyo.

Also, it looks like sente, so afterwards I should be able to go back the lower right quarter of the board, which is where I think is most interesting at the moment.

Of course, if it turns out not to be sente I might have to accept a local loss to keep sente and attack the lower right quarter.

[SGF\] This is the wrong move.  It strengthens W but does not do s much to help B. The left side is still under cut.  See variation starting at 'A'.

The lower right  is not as important as the comments above imply.  The marked B stones are very solid making it uninteresting to develop the right.  If B invades the bottom then he will probably end up losing his central moyo.]
;W[dc]C[John Rae: Not quite sente, but the idea of taking the corner and leaving the two stones to fight for their life did not really appeal.

However it does strengthen black's position a bit so it was touch and go.

[SGF\] There was no other move to consider.];B[gd]C[Ben Bildstein: I often see games between stronger players where they press down on the two-space extension along the third line. I don't think I understand the tactics of it very well, but I think I can force here. I fully expect g17.

I think the regular follow-up for Black afterwards would be j16, but it doesn't look to great, so I may end up going back to the lower right straight away.

I also considered f16 and h16.];W[gc]C[John Rae: Yes I think that was forced. I'm not sure if it keeps white out of the centre or not. As I understand it the tactic often involves losing the pressing stone in exchange for getting a solid barrier a row or two back.]
;B[id]LB[hp:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I think this is going to do a fairly good job of closing you in.

I know the lower right is big and this is gote, but I can't see any way to make progress in the lower right in sente.

I just wish I knew how to judge which area I should be playing in.

[SGF} As commented earlier. B needs to get to play at 'A' first, so any move here must guarantee sente.]
;W[ee]LB[ck:A][hp:B]C[John Rae: I think its a must for me to break into the middle so it was semte :)

Whether this does the job for me is another matter. I think it may give me a bigger corner rather than breaking into the middle but that seems OK

[SGF\]  If B plays correctly this does not get in too far.  W would probably do better to play around 'A' before B gets to play at 'B']

(;B[ef]C[Ben Bildstein: Looks to me like it works. It's certainly not a move I considered.

[SGF\] This looks timid to me.  LOok at the variation.]
(;W[fe]C[John Rae: Not something I'd normally see. The advantage of

a) slower play on Dragon
b) stopping to comment moves rather than just playing

Well I have to continue into the middle I think. D15 was tempting but the extra corner isn't that big really.

Now I think its about how black approaches the lower right and when/if  white invades or reduces the left.

I have this gut feel that white getting into the centre helps to pressure black's top right in some way, although I'm not clear how. Its not sente or anything.

[SGF\]  W can be more agressive - see the variations.];B[ff]
C[Ben Bildstein: Yes, I'm slightly nervous about the top right.

For now, I figure I can keep pushing here.

[SGF\] Why be nervouse about the top right?  It is solidly connected to the strong stones facing down the right side.]
;W[gf]C[John Rae: Well I can't keeppushing and let you build another wall so it has to be a hane. I'll get 2 stones inside the moyo and have to run to live - but it will reduce it lots more.

[SGF\]  As shown in the earlier variations, the hane should have been earlier.  This stone is much harder to make shape with than an earlier hane would have been.]
;B[ge]C[Ben Bildstein: Here I felt I had to make a choice between h17 and g15. I chose g15 because I figured if I were you, I'd ignore h17 and connect with g15.]
;W[hf]C[John Rae: Yes no question, I expected G15 and would have gladly connected given the chance - if you'd followed through after H17 I would take sente.

Now I'm hoping he threats to the stones on top will allow me to run effectively. After which I think white has a slight lead in territory.]
;B[ie]C[Ben Bildstein: I'm not going to make any predictions. Time will tell.

I am happy about having a weak group to chase, though.

For me the decision at this point was between j14 and j15. My reading of it is that if Black j14, White can immediately h15 and end up cutting j14 off, and probably capture it.

[SGF\] This is the only move.  Now W has two isolated stones.  If he tries to save them hs should almost certainly lose because B will build territory to the left and reduce W's moyo at the bottom while chasing.  All W can rally do with these stones is threaten to save them while building a moyo at the lower right.]
;W[gi]C[John Rae: Not a prediction there's  a lot to happen yet :)Just a feeling that will influence how i play.

J15 seems correct to me.

This jump seems ideal in the circumstances and will hopefully allow the group to develop shape to live.

I was tempted to leave the 2 stones becasue white could really use sente now, but its far too risky.

[SGF\] All this move does is invite B to secure a large territory on the side while W plays a series of dame points.  W has almost no territory potential in the center, so running with these stones is pointless.]

(;B[jg]C[Ben Bildstein: There may be some effective way to attack these two stones, but I don't know what it is. So rather than playing some forcing move that actually ends up helping you more than me, I will instead try to put pressure on you stones while making territory.

Of course, I'm not sure if I'm doing this the right way, or from the right side, but, well, I'm only a kyu player.

[SGF\] See the variation.]
(;W[qn]LB[gk:A]C[John Rae: Well, i'm taking sente and risking losing the two stones.

No idea if its best since they are cutting stones but I'm not seeing lots of value in the cut compared to R6 which seems to start to make territory in the corner and reduces the effect of a black approach there.

[SGF\] Cutting stones which cut two live groups are a fantasy.  Now that W has added an extra stone it is impossible to give them up.  In addition, B failed to play at 'A' so W should try to take advantage of that.  Although this play is big, it is not urgent.]

(;B[hh]LB[gk:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I agree. You move is very big. I though that logically I would end up with sente, but I suppose it is one thing to acknowledge that a group is weak, and another entirely to figure out how to attack it.

Still, I figure I must attack. I hope to be able to force you into a heavy shape and then cut off your escape with g9...

Actually, upon further consideration, I'm really not sure which I should play first, h12 or g9.

[SGF\] This is a very small move.  W can easily give up the two stones as they are not effective as cutting stones.  'A' is the only move.]
;W[ck]LB[dj:A]C[John Rae: well the logic of my last move was to acept losing those stones so I really ought to continue with the strategy.

I reckon that it I reduce the side I still have the aji of those stones and can reduce the centre by threatening to save them.

[SGF\] This is very good thinking but I would try 'A'.]
(;B[cj]LB[bf:B][dk:C][ek:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I like your move. It is a nice splitting move, leaving my stones both above and below slightly unsettled.

I will try to make you heavy and then start a splitting attack between your invading stones and you center group.

[SGF\] but the trouble is that it is hard to make W heavy.  His jump to 'A' in the game was a nice move.  Because B is open at 'B' it is pointless trying to make territory at the upper left.  Playing 'C' looks better.]
;W[ek]C[John Rae: And I like your response :) I was expecting you to make me live inside and felt happy reducing and making territory.

Now I have to run and let the aji of the stones above help me attack the black stones below. Not sure if there's a real attack though.]
;B[dl]LB[bk:C][cl:B][cm:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I don't know how to handle your move. I hope this forcing move is not aji-keshi.

You have significantly more territory than me. I am going to have to attack these central stones effectively if I'm going to win.

[SGF\] This is aji keshi.  There are several other points B might want to play around here (A, B, or C for example) and which are lost by this move.]
;W[dk]C[John Rae: Not sure, it seems to help the bottom stones although it does leave room underneath the D8 stone.

Certainly white now has 2 weak groups which are getting heavier by the minute. At least one has to escape otherwsie its a big big centre.]
;B[fl]LB[fj:A]C[Ben Bildstein: I feel I've left myself in a position where I can't stop your two groups from connecting (i.e. by playing f10) without giving you enough forcing moves to make one of your groups completely safe.

So I will let you connect them and hope they still end up heavy.

[SGF\] Nice idea, if it works.  B can also consider splitting at. 'A' but I prefer the move played.]
;W[el]C[John Rae: Connecting would be nice but I think I have to first look for eyes somehow.]
;B[em]C[Ben Bildstein: I'm not sure why, but your move seems a little aji-keshi somehow. I suppose you are planning on playing c8 now.]
;W[fk]C[John Rae: I wamted to set up an atari to help me run a bit more and I think I may have the possibility of an eye on the side as well. Options for an eye seem to be  D10 C8 or C7, even B7 but I'd be equally happy to get G8 and run.]
;B[gl]C[Ben Bildstein: You're looking stronger and stronger, and I'm being forced. I clearly have much to learn.

[SGF\]  Another way to look at it is that you are forcing W to make you do exactly what you want him to do -- force you toward his moyo while having to live.]
;W[dj]C[John Rae: Outside influence is tricky to use - it can easily go badly wrong if the attack fails.

My group is gaining strength ~(as would be expected with more moves) but it isn't alive yet]
;B[ci]C[Ben Bildstein: My group above is getting weaker.

Your move made an empty triangle. I wonder if there wasn't a better way to achieve the same thing.]
;W[ei]LB[cm:A]C[John Rae: Yes the empty triangle is an issue. I couldn't see another way that made sure of an eye, for example if I'd done this straight away would D10 would have been Ok for black even though it made another empty triangle?

On balance I think you're right, there must have been a better way.

[SGF\] I think W played well enough here.  W is as good as alive.  Playing 'A' gives a second eye]

(;B[cl]C[Ben Bildstein: Well, you've got one eye. I suppose if I'm to have any hope of keeping you weak, I'm going to have to stop you getting an eye on the edge here (I think b7 would have got you an eye).

I'm not happy with how this fight turned out. I feel like I've already lost the game. I suppose I'm going to have to do a good job of reducing your lower side to have any chance.]
;W[eh]LB[bk:A]C[John Rae: Yes I think your descent was good.

I thought about B9 to keep you apart, which looks good but I think the priority must be more eyes.

[SGF} 'A' is big.  Not only does it connect B and this secure all the stones, it forces W to run away.  In the process of running away the W moyo will automatically be reduced.]
;B[hi]C[Ben Bildstein: But does e12 do that?

Well, upon consideration, I think that e12 puts a lot of pressure on the three stones around c11. For example, it seems that if you played b9 you would be threatening to capture them with c13, and even that I couldn't answer at b10 because you could still capture at c13. Of course, I'm not completely sure.

I think you now have a move at g12 that gives you great shape. I get the feeling that if you play there and I want to kill you or keep you weak, I'm going to have to waste a move playing inside your shape with f10.

I was ready to play b9, but my instinct says to enclose you. I don't know why. You may be able to attack on the left severely enough to make a second eye - I don't know.

Oh well. Here goes.

[SGF\] I think this is too ambitious.  B will probably lose something in the upper left now and has not gained a whole lot on the outside.  True, this move is thick, but it does not gain as much as it loses.]
;W[cg]C[John Rae: On reflection I don't think e12 was good, H11 is a great reply. The white group only has one eye becaue you can play inside if I do something simple like G12

H11 also strengthens the H12 stone which I much prefered being solo. This means the 2 stones at G14 are likely to die so I think I'm best threatening the group in the top left while at the same time aiming at the three B11 stones.

[SGF\]  Nice move. B will lose some stones if he tries to stop the W group from connecting to the corner.]
;B[bk]C[Ben Bildstein: Well, I don't think d13 works because you can squeeze the c11 groups so well that you can get half an eye on the edge and then cut my group off with g13, killing it.

My move aims to connect the c11 group and give the e14 group two ways to run - g13 (although this could lead to a painful squeeze) and d13 (which should now work).

I think e12 was fine. I think you're in a good position. When you live, I'm not going to be left with much.]
;W[dg]C[John Rae: I was tempted to play G13 and go to capture the whole group but I'm not 100% convinced I win the capture race - you get lots of forcing moves to reduce my eye space.

So this seems to temporise well. I expect you to play G13 and I'll then try to connect on the side.

[SGF\] G13 does not work.  This move is correct.  It is sente and now W can connect to the corner any time.  This means that W gets first move in the lower right.]
;B[gg]C[Ben Bildstein: It seems the most I can hope for now is sente. I think I can get it, but if it turns out I'm wrong I'm going to wish I'd abandoned the three stones at e14

I didn't consider that you might be able to capture with g13. It's something I'll want to have a look at some time.

I'd gladly trade placed with you now.];W[be]C[John Rae: I thought about risking F13 to get sente but I think its too risky.

I think I've come out of this phase pretty well but sente would really be huge now. Capturing those 2 white stones has made the top right are much safer territory for you and black has quite a bit of influence so I don't feel comfortable yet.

It may well be that this is too cautious and might lose the game.

[SGF\] This move is too slow.  It can be played any time and it is gote for B to prevent it.  Save this move until needed.]

(;B[nq]LB[jp:A][pq:B]C[Ben Bildstein: It's hard to say. You may have been able to pull off something bigger (sente), but I'm not sure. Also, though, f13 might not have hurt anyway, even if it didn't give you sente (or allow you to capture those four stones).

Now, where to play? I really don't know. I considered k17 (big but too gote), q7 to try to map out a large territory. What did you expect me to play?

I think r6 being on the third line helps me to play o3, because after a possible White p3 for Black o4 exchange, I have q5 to aim at.

[SGF\] This is the wrong idea.  B has a moyo in the upper center.  Invading will cause W to chase B out and reduce that moyo.  B should be looking to increase his own moyo while reducing W's.  'A' is the move to do this.  B could consider playing 'B' before 'A' to test W's reaction.]
;W[oq]C[John Rae: I have to say I expected O3, it seems the best move to me.

I anticipate O4 followed by M3 and then as you say its a bit of a scrap from which I hope I'll be able to take sente.

I did consider Q3 which I expected would lead to L3 and my sente but this felt like making it too easy for you.]
;B[np]C[Ben Bildstein: I think q2 would be better (and more normal) than q3. It secures the corner a bit more, and doesn't allow Black to play p2 in sente, which would increase his eye-space a bit.

I wanted to tenuki here but I couldn't find a suitably big point. I guess that's why I played here in the first place. k17 and q8 seem big. Perhaps we'll get one each.]

(;W[qk]LB[on:A]C[John Rae: yes q 2 would be more normal but aji at R3 was why I thought about the route of Q3

However back to what we actually did.

My original thought of M3 is all very well but is perhaps not sente (I confess it was your comment that prompted me to re-evaluate.) Letting black get Q8 would be very big I think so I'm doing this first.

K17 is big but now I think M3 is a bigger threat so I'm not sure if you will play L3. I think I'd do so becasue the black outside influence is coming into play strongly now - H4 is looking dood for black soon.

However K17 is also very big so I'm not certain what to expect.

[SGF\] This move is not so good.  It is very close to the B thickness above and has little effect on the B stones below.  I prefer 'A', which threatens the B stones and aims to reduce the B moyo in a big way.]
;B[kq]LB[jo:A]C[Ben Bildstein: It's okay to be influenced by what I say. It gives you more to think about and hopefully we end up playing a better game.

I was thinking of playing q8 instead of r8, so as to start to turn some of the influence in the centre into territory. You could slide to s8, but then I could make some central moyo with something like m8 (or something in the middle there - I really have no idea what a good point would be).

h4 is big and sente. k17 is probably bigger but definitely gote. g2 is something for later - it will probably be sente by the time it gets played.

I'm still hoping to get a chance to play q5, but I'm not sure how much good it will do.

But all things considered, I don't think anything can be as important as making a base for my stones, especially given that m3 for you would be a pincer and an extension.

I wonder if I had let you play m3 how I would continue. Force at m4, and then at q5? Maybe that wouldn't be so bad, but it's hard to tell. And I figured if I let these stones get attacked, I'd have no hope of making territory in the centre.


[SGF\] This is a little unimaginative.  B should be aiming to help the moyo above. 'A' looks more interesting.]
;W[jc]LB[io:A]C[John Rae: G2 was a thought I'd not considered. however i think its worth risking leaving that for a little.

I like k17 because if its not sente I get the chance to do serious harm to your territory up there. I have O18 and should be able to pull out the O17 stone. I think there is a good chance you will respond to K17 the balance of territroy would be so much in white's favour if black loses that on the top.

[SGF\] No doubt that it is a big move.  Buit is it urgent.  True W can reduce if B ignores, but a move around 'A' is bigger.  It would be a multipurpose move, whereas this move has only one intent.]
;B[ld]LB[io:A][jo:B]C[Ben Bildstein: I mean c2, not g2. Sorry about that.

Your move is difficult to respond to. I should have considered exactly what I could do about it if you played there. I was thinking too much about how good it would be if I played there and not enough about how good it would be for you if you played there.

Perhaps this was more imnportant than making a base at the bottom. No, surely not. Surely nothing can be more important than making a base. I don't know.

I wonder if my move is the best. L16 and L17 didn't seem to work.

[SGF\]  This is not so big.  'A" or 'B' is much better.];W[io]
LB[jc:A][ld:B]C[John Rae: Sorry, I edit my comments so must be putting the tags in the wrong place :(

M16 does look better than L16. I somehow feel there is still aji in the position either with the O17 stone or the H14 stones but I don't see how to use it :)

G2 I thought was an interesting idea - aiming to kill/threaten the whole group on the bottom - I couldn't clearly see if it worked but I was genuinely concerned I was missing something. C2 is equally worrying

Anyway I think I now need to worry about c2 or any other attack on that bottom group. C2 would be a safe way but I'me still worried about the centre. I've chosen this way because it also puts some small pressure on your group. I don't think this is sente against the bottom, my main interest is to move into the middle.

I expect H4 forcing H3 and I hope this will lead to moves that will spill over to the right and threaten the black group

[SGF\]  Good.  W shuold have played this on the previous move and when he did not, B should have played it.  The 'A' exchange is almost incidental to the main flow.]

(;B[ko]C[Ben Bildstein: k17 m16 is a good sente exchange. You made profit, so you don't need to worry too much yet about how to use the aji.

I don't like the h4/h3 exchange yet. I'm simply not willing to risk my group getting weak. But perhaps with this move I'm starting to work up to putting some pressure on your group on the left.

I'm starting to worry about the cut at f7.

[SGF\]  This is the honest move, but if B is confident he can live at the bottom there are several moves to expand the b central moyo whcih may be more interesting.  The cut at 'A' is not a problem right now.  B can respond at 'B'.]

(;W[nk]C[John Rae: I'd not even considered f7. I think at present there would be little difficulty connecting to the top stones but it might help white push into the moyo.

I don't feel able to take a move on the bottom. Now your group is safer it seems most urgent to jump into the middle as soon as I can

[SGF\] Perfect.];B[pk]LB[nk:A]C[Ben Bildstein: (Bildstein:)
Yeah, I still don't think it's time for f7. It just looks like I'm going to have to worry about it eventually.

I see the two space jump as too far. I'm not sure how to attack it, though.

[SGF\] This looks a little unreasonable.  True, B can cut off 'A', but W is strengthen on the right so B will have to be sure of killing 'A' in that case.]

(;W[pl]C[[SGF\] This is a little too direct and have little chance of success.  Be more indirect.  LOok at the variations.]
;B[ol]C[Ben Bildstein: In light of a game I played last night, p9 may have made a better attack for Black (instead of q9) if it meant I could sacrifice it to solidify in other directions. I should have considered p9 as a possible sacrifice, but I didn't, and I'm not going to worry about it now.

I'm really not sure wheter to go p8 or p9. I can't even come up with any concrete critereon to help me choose. So I'm following my intuition.

No other moves occured to me.

I agree that you'll probably end up being able to attack my bottom group again.

[SGF\] Obvious.  W has problems]
(;W[pj]C[John Rae: I've had connection problems at home so only able to move at work - which gives me less time to think on the spot but more inbetween times.

I've decide the attack on the bottom is not strong enough to be of value and its more important to break into the middle

This way will lead to some form of local fight I think - and its not clear how it will work out.

[SGF\]  Dont' see how this can work.];B[ok]C[Ben Bildstein: If you play p10 now, I'll have three cutting point. It's going to be hard to maintain connnection to the bottom right.

Of course, I'll be short of liberties, too.];W[oj]C[John Rae: yes, its going to be tricky :)]
;B[nl]LB[qj:A]C[Ben Bildstein: (Bildstein:)
I really don't think I can win this game. You have so much side and corner territory. How did I get myself into this mess?

I think I'll have to get all of the centre to make it.

[SGF\] B must cut at 'A'];W[ql]C[John Rae: Mmm, Its not quite so clear cut but yes black has more. I think the group in the upper left connecting and living made a big difference becasue it removed some of the benefit of all the outside influnce you'd built up in exchange for territory.

I was expecting some cut and fight because I think you need points in the middle. Now I've connected I feel a bit safer.]
;B[qj]C[Ben Bildstein: I think I can cut. This is a sort of tricky move, so be careful.]
;W[qi]C[John Rae: Nice move - I don't think I've any option]
;B[rj]C[Ben Bildstein: I didn't see it until just now.

Why sacrifice one when you can sacrifice two? :)];W[ri]C[John Rae: I considered switching to an attack on the botom with N10 but I don't see it somehow.]
;B[pi]C[Ben Bildstein: Me neither really.

I don't have much to say here because q11 is obviously just a follow-up to s10.]

(;W[nj]LB[rk:A]C[John Rae: Well, i've decided that centre is just to big to allow so time for some risks

[SGF\] Hard to give up the side. There is no guarantee of living in the middle.]
;B[rh]C[Ben Bildstein: Good. That's what I needed. Now I have a chance to kill these four stones on a large scale, which should give me a chance to win the game.

(and s12 is nice to have against the top right, for later)

But I'm not saying I would have done anything differently, except perhaps o9, but I'm not sure exactly what.]
;W[ml]C[John Rae: :)

I think R8 was my mistake, left me with no choice but to  somehow live in the middle - it has lost me a lot of territory on the side]
;B[mm]C[Ben Bildstein: Your stones are weak, but they two groups to run towards (f9 and j5) and a slight possibility of living without connecting out, and my stones are very short of liberties, and my group at the bottom is not beyond attack.

So my summary is that I might be able to kill you, but chances are you'll be okay.]

(;W[kk]C[John Rae: Yes, I agree my group has good chances to run.

I thought about the double hane at M7 but decided a simple run was safer.

[SGF} W should not be thinking of running.  The double hane is correct and makes shape while forcing B to play dame.]
;B[mk]C[Ben Bildstein: I'd have played the double hane.];W[mj]
C[John Rae: You could well prove right, the double hane already looks more attractive :(]
;B[lk]C[Ben Bildstein: Can't tell if this works, but I can't see any obvious problems and it's sure better than m8 if it does work, because of White m9, which seems almost to force Black n8, which would of course be horrible.]
;W[rk]C[John Rae: Just taking the end game play while I decide between M8 and M10 (meeting to go to)

I'm tempted by M8 but I'm not sure it works and the count is awfully close if I sacrifice those 5 stones]
;B[si]C[Ben Bildstein: Taking these two stones seems nice, but I can't see anything wrong with your move, unless it influences the top right corner. s9 would have been double sente eventually.

I wonder if I have anything in the corner (apart from reducing with s15 or t15). I'll have to have a good look eventually.

I've got no advice for you on whether to choose m8 or m10. If only we had a 5 dan around :) m10 followed by k10 is one line I considered (probably the most).]
;W[lj]C[John Rae: Yes, i agree this line seems best, or at least prudent.

I'm not sure if there's anything major in the top right. I think there is lots of scope to reduce but not more than that. Of course I could be wrong, which would be a big problem]
;B[ll]C[Ben Bildstein: I've got good shape everywhere on the board now. After I see how this pans out (when it stops being urgent) I'll have to figure out what the balance of territory is. All territories are fairly well established now, so I should be able to get a fairly good idea. Then I'll have to decide whether just to play the end game, or try to kill/split something.]
;W[jj]C[John Rae: Yes, black is pretty settled, but white is not. By my count white is ahead in territory (unless this centre group dies) so I'm expecting to experience some attacks.

I'm a bit worried about H4 or similar now. If that areras was solid I think I'd not have trouble living

[SGF\]  The game now depends on whether W lives.  Pity to miss the double hane earlier in the sequence.  The roles are now completely reversed.]
;B[ki]C[Ben Bildstein: I think you can't afford to let me l10, and this may stop you getting an eye later on. And I don't think I need the aji of a possible atari on l9 (or a few stones including l9) for later on.

I'm still trying to capture the whole group.];W[kh]LB[hj:B]
[jm:A]C[John Rae: I considered L8 but its not quite there.

I'm expect you to simply play K11 or similar. i'm not sure if having this stone there inside your territory is a help or not but it just seems it might be.

I'm not feeling too confident - my decision to go with this group in the centre instead of tking the safe route on the side is not looking too sound - but it was a lot of points in the middle so perhaps there was no choice. I'll have to recount it after the game and see if it was a blunder.

[SGF\] No need for anything fancy here.  Just connect.  It makes miai of 'A' and 'B" and W should be able to cope.]
;B[ji]C[Ben Bildstein: I don't know what's going on any more. I think I can force here at least. But after that I've got no idea whether it should be k8 or j9.]
;W[kj]LB[kh:A][ji:B]C[John Rae: Well I put off connecting by one move - not sure if the stone at L12 is any use but its there

K8 J9 is a hard choice I'm not sure either is the harshest attack. Somethnig more in the middle of the gap looks interesting ( around J7?) but its out in the open so weak. I can't read it at all well, just too many options.

I'm hoping to find ways of playing at M7 to give a few forcing squeeze moves but I can't see ity at present.

[SGF\] No the exchange of 'A' for 'B' looks very silly. 'C' is now not a good a move for W]
;B[im]C[Ben Bildstein: I'll try it. I immediately thought of k8 and j9 because they are angle plays, which are notoriously eye-stealing. But I think this move does a better job of cutting off access to the bottom group, and still works okay with m8.

I expect h10, sooner or later, and I'm not sure how I'm going to handle it.]
;W[jm]LB[hj:A]C[John Rae: Yes it looks too good :(

Oh well lets see, theres a very outside chance I can force at least one eye in exchange for being cut off

[SGF\] W should not force B to solidify himself.  Try 'A' directly.- it is going to be needed anyway.]
;B[il]C[Ben Bildstein: For the record, I'd have played h10, or if I was filling skillful, something that aimed at h10 (but I can't imagine what). The k7/j8 exchange certainly doesn't help.

My think here is this: My response really has to be something that answers the threat of k6. I chose the move played because I wanted to be as strong as possible in the direction of h10.

There seemed to be a few options, and I couldn't really decide between them, but in these situations I usually decide to choose a move that I can justify on logical, rather than tactical, grounds. That way, if I'm wrong, I can find or have someone point out to me the logical reasoning for whichever move is better, and hopefully learn something.]
;W[lm]C[John Rae: Yes you're right, i'm in trouble.

Only option is to find some attack on the stones cutting me off.]
;B[km]C[Ben Bildstein: (Bildstein:)
Yes, I thought you were aiming at playing that (eventually). I'm still mindful of h10. I think if you escape, it will involve playing h10.

My move aims to capture this stone while making k6 and k8 miai.]
;W[jn]C[John Rae: L7 was nice, I'd not considered that.];B[jl]
C[Ben Bildstein: Thanks. Black k8 seems to mean that I can play j10 in response to White h10 now, instead of Black g10, which I thought I would have to play.]
;W[hj]C[John Rae: Thats what comes of my playing in a rush before I go to work :)

But I don't think I had a good way out];B[gj]C[Ben Bildstein: Nor me. What do you think is the score (balance of secure territory)?

I wonder which side I should cut: g10 or j10. They both seem to work, but this one seems a little better in that I think it means I can connect through rather than just cutting.]
;W[ii]C[John Rae: I'd score black about 90 white possibly 75 (including komi).

This is primarily becasue I've been greedy and tried to pull out thise stones. If I'd simply connected on the right and accepted losing the middle I'd counted white was about 5 up. I felt this was too close to risk. Before that  O9 was too greedy for the same reason. One of my major failings comes to haunt me :(


I think my only chance is to look to capture these two stones. I think you have to let me do it. This may leave some fight in the middle but I'm not confident.]
;B[ih]C[Ben Bildstein: (Bildstein:)
I didn't consider that move. Still, it seems to work out okay.]
;W[ij];B[gk];W[jh]C[John Rae: Finding a second eye looks unlikely though]
;B[kg]C[Ben Bildstein: It will almost certainly decide the game.

h14, etc., still seem to have some aji. They are the reason I'm not playing m12, which was my thought after j12.]
;W[lh]TR[il][jl]C[John Rae: I agree about the aji, also agree I don't see any specific line of play

Don't know whether to expect M13 or O12 in reply. I think there may be miai

[SGF\] W looks very dead.  Forcing B to play the marked stones with no return for W was costly.]
;B[lg]C[Ben Bildstein: I was worried about how the cut at j13 would threaten g12 (saving the group) if I started driving you up starting with m12.]
;W[mg]C[John Rae: Well the only chance is to run towards the top and hope for some space. Its not harming anything since this was all black territory anyway.]
;B[mh]C[Ben Bildstein: This seems like the obvious move. I suppose you could try o12, but I think I should be okay.]
;W[of]C[John Rae: Yes that pretty much finishes off the group, i think the only chance is to use threats to safe it to reduce your territory somehow. But fisrt threaten to cutt off the group on the side]
;B[pf]C[Ben Bildstein: I think I'm safe to play here because as soon as you play q13, Black has r15 to capture two stones and connect.]
;W[ln]C[John Rae: Yes, I'm on last desperate struggles, it could be time to resign soon.]
;B[kn]C[Ben Bildstein: Just ddon't resign until you're sure. No move is quite as aji-keshi as resignation.]
;W[kl]C[John Rae: I always wait until its hopeless, but in this case that may be soon :)

This cut is a must. Not sure of the follow up yet];B[ml]C[Ben Bildstein: Yep, that sure isn't aji-keshi.]
;W[lo]C[John Rae: This looks sente as well.

I think M4 will be black's move];B[lp]C[Ben Bildstein: I was a little worried about n5 (instead of m5 as played), but I thought it would be okay anyway. But now these three stones are definitely captured, so I will not have to worry about the strength of this group again.]
;W[ke]C[John Rae: Yes I didn't think of M4 until after I'd played :)]
;B[kd]C[Ben Bildstein: Difficult. Black k16 looks like it would let you save either l15 or h14.]
;W[jd]C[John Rae: Small tricks are the only opportunity left, but the position seems to leave a few.]
;B[je]C[Ben Bildstein: Fair enough. As long as I can't see any problems, I'll keep trying to hold my ground.]
;W[mr]C[John Rae: Lets twist down to the bottom. I don't think I can reduce the big group to a dead shape but there may be gains to be made.

[SGF\] W is now in panic mode. This is a good point to stop reviewing.]
;B[nr]C[Ben Bildstein: I guess if it's going to happen, this is the place for it.]
;W[kr]C[John Rae: but will it work?  Does not look hopefull. Just nibbling the edges is not enough, white has to capture something and/or get the middle to live.]
;B[jr]C[Ben Bildstein: No, it doesn't look hopeful. And o2 weakened the bottom right corner.]
;W[lq]C[John Rae: My thinknig is that in the circumstances the weakening of the corner does not matter that much, white's lost anyway unless somethnig special comes off.  Any loss is acceptable if the centre can spring to life.]
;B[mq]C[Ben Bildstein: Sounds reasonable.

I didn't consider m3.];W[lr];B[jq]C[Ben Bildstein: As long as m6, etc., remain dead, I should be alright.]
;W[hm]C[John Rae: yes, and they look dead to me];B[hl]C[Ben Bildstein: I guess I should keep it simple. F11 was tempting, though.]
;W[gh]C[John Rae: I think F11 was better cos this is sente then I try F7]
;B[fg]C[Ben Bildstein: Yes, but I'm more confident that this way works.]
;W[co]C[John Rae: True - I'm running out of ideas];B[do];W[bl]
;B[bj]C[Ben Bildstein: I didn't consider attacking from that side. I suppose after c5, I should have. I was worried that if you approached at b12 I would end up having to connect all the way back to b8, but that's end-game, I suppose.]
;W[cm]C[John Rae: With black's lead I'd have played B7 and accepted losing 3 stones. I didn't see any other clear danger there.

Now there's the chance white mught capture more - but I think black ought to win the race.]
;B[dm]C[Ben Bildstein: I think I'm okay. I have five liberties, and I can't see any way for you to connect b8 to c5.]
;W[bn]C[John Rae: No I can't connect but the threat might help things in the corner]
;B[cn];W[bp]C[John Rae: Mind you the group on the bottom will be in danger now :(]
;B[bq]C[Ben Bildstein: Yes. It's already looking thin.

This seems to take us to a five-liberties-to-five situation.]
;W[bm]C[John Rae: Yes if white loses this then the game is definitely over]
;B[cp]C[Ben Bildstein: This seems like the only move. I can't see how I could attack those four stones without first forcing b5.

What I'm really worried about here is a ko. For example if one of us captures a stone on the first line.]
;W[nh]C[John Rae: The ko doesn't seem to help me, i'm at leat 2 moves behind. So its look elsewhere]
;B[li]C[Ben Bildstein: This is definitely forced. I wanted to play o3, 'cos it's a move I love so much, but here it just doesn't seem to work.]
;W[ng]C[John Rae: and now I run a bit :)];B[nf]C[Ben Bildstein: Considering the shortage of liberties of r13 and r14, and the strenght of the stones on the left after the capture of three stones with m11, I think I can get away with this.]
;W[mf]C[John Rae: Yes I think you probably can :)];B[ne];W[me]
C[John Rae: Try as I might this is going nowhere Resign next move I think

Thanks for the game, an interesting experiment to do the comments.

Overall this game seems to me to be a prime example of making the last big mistake. Once white had a heavy group in the centre it was alsways going to be a loss unless it escaped. I'm not sure the risk of this was ever necessary so O9 probally started the problems.]
;B[nd]C[Ben Bildstein: Yes. Thanks for the game. It really has been an interesting experience. I just hope we left enough mistakes that our reviewer has something to say :)]
