C[Dear Reviewer,

I play black here. In this game, i took alot of territory first to the extent that the game became very unbalanced -- and i had to pay a high price (except i got lucky at the end and still won). Could you help in pointing out how I can play a more balanced game.

This is a recurring problem in my games: i get too much territory and my opponent gets too much influence. I would like to play more balanced way.

Thank you!

forfun (hereafter ff) - This is an interesting game with some wild swings back and forth.  For review purposes, however, I will concentrate on the beginning.  In my opinion Black needs to improve at creating a more balanced game.  Black does seem very fond of territory and to underestimate the potential benefits of thickness.  Even though Black says this in the statement above, the comments later in the game file seem to indicate that the recognition of the problem is not very strong yet.  Let's see what I mean...]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[cf];W[ep];B[fd];W[df];B[dg];W[ef]

(;B[cc]C[ff - This shows confusion with the D11 pincer joseki.  There White has the initiative and Black dodges into the corner.  In this case, however, Black has played a double approach move when White played away.  Black has the initiative and needs to get sufficient compensation for playing twice in the upper left.  Jumping in to the 3-3 point is too passive an approach.  C15 is literally the "only play" if you check professional games.  See the variation...]
;W[ce];B[dc];W[cg]C[ff - White has been allowed to make too strong a position here.  In addition, the choice of F16 is now questionable because of the defect left behind at H17 that we will see later.]

(;B[cm]C[looks like the black got a better deal here... is that right?

ff - The fundamental point that Black should take away from this review is that this position is *not* good for Black.  First the play in the upper left was too passive/conservative.  Now this 2-space extension is the same thing again.  If Black has to react to the White thickness in the upper left, the choice of play in the upper left corner was even worse than it appeared considering only the local situation there :-)

What should Black do instead?  See the variations...];W[dn]
C[ff - White reacts well, pushing Black down consistently across the board.]
;B[cn];W[cq];B[bq];W[dp];B[co]
(;W[jq]C[ff - Normal is D2 here (see variation).  In any case, however, White is spreading out across the board while Black is huddling in the corners...]
;B[bf]C[ff - Just weakens the corner.];W[be];B[qn];W[nd];B[nq]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on]
(;B[pr]C[Is 3-3 better here? Or other alternatives? See variation.

ff - 3-3 is normal.  What would Black have done if White replied at 3-3?  White lets Black off easy here.  Basically in this game Black wants to live everywhere and deny White any territory.  This just does not happen in Go between two opponents of similar strength.  Black would be better to consider the idea of *exchanges*.  "If my opponent gets X, where do I take my Y in exchange?"]

(;W[qo];B[qq];W[qm]C[ff - Presumably White is content to build more thickness toward the center while Black plays passively in the corner.  Notice that Black's Q2 is lower than the usual Q3.]
;B[qg]C[ff - Again a small, conservative play from Black.  This is basically a single-purpose play to blunt White's thickness in the lower right.  It is too low to serve as an attack on the White stone on the upper side and is too narrow to make significant territory for Black.]

(;W[jc]C[ff - A mistake by White.  It invites Black H17 which both attacks White and patches the Black defect in the upper right.]
;B[hc]C[ff - Black should be really pleased by the opportunity to play this.]
;W[mp]C[So far, i like black... what's your assessment?

ff - Despite White's recent misstep at the top, I prefer White.  Where does Black go from here?  Where are the prospective territories?  Black has four corners (assuming White does not get the upper right after attaching at R17) and nothing else except a potential attack on White's upper side extension.]
;B[lc]C[This seemed the right point at this stage... but somehow it resulted in too much influence for white! What would you have played here?

ff - This is normal for a direct attack.  The problem here is deeper than what stone to play now.  Because Black has four separate low groups in the corners, there is no very good strategy for going forward.  The White stones are not subject to a dangerous attack (one that would threaten to capture them entirely).  Black has no good *indirect* plays to make here that might result in building a large-scale net around the White stones.  This is a result of the previous play.  It is an indication that Black should be dissatisfied with his play up to this point.]
;W[qc];B[rc]C[ff - Another passive play.  Black is strong here.]
;W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[mc]C[again, white is invariably bulding a huge framework...

ff - White is just reacting to Black's play.  If the result is invariable, it is due to Black rather than White.]
;W[md];B[jb];W[el]C[Could you give your assessment here? What's the right reduction point for black now?

ff - There is no *silver bullet* that will solve Black's problem.  White has a very deep, very strong framework.  

*Important*
Note that Black has played played twenty-four stones so far.  Twenty-one have been played on the second or third line.  Only three stones have been played on the fourth line - and two of them (D13 and Q7) have been sacrificed in order to play more third-line stones!  Not even one stone has been played above the fourth line.  Black *should not* expect to win this way.]

(;B[ip]C[ff - Again Black wants to erase everything.  To my eye, this stone is like the one at Q2.  Black needs to work more on judging what is a reasonable compromise.]
;W[im]C[now j4 looks kinda bad...

ff - The problem is not that Black might be captured (although that happens here).  Rather it is that while Black struggles to make life, White can create further areas of territory in the center and on the sides.  That is the natural result from White's earlier center-oriented play.]
;B[fq];W[dr]C[ff - The exchange of F3 for D2 looks fairly  natural as Black tries to live.  However, Black should recognize that D2 is a very good play for White that results in a big profit in the corner and (later) on the left side.]

(;B[jp]C[ff - This looks pretty slow.  Black pushes from behind.]

;W[lk]C[ff - White should play N5 first?]
(;B[nm]C[ff - Again, Black should take the opportunity to play N5.  See variation...]
;W[mo]C[ff - Spoils Black shape]

;B[hq];W[gr];B[gp];W[ho];B[eo];W[do];B[lg]C[at this stage, game over for black.. but i decide to fight on...

ff - I would say at this point that White is probably 25-30 points ahead.  Since White throws the game away later it is hard to argue with Black's decision to play on.  From the point of view of study, however, the game *is* over.]

;W[op];B[ll];W[kj];B[jk];W[jl];B[gs]C[ff - Note that everything Black has done since M13 has strengthened White in the center.  Black is less likely to capture the upper side White stones now than at the time White played Q17.  If White just answers this (H1 or F1),  everything holds.]

ff - If Black is afraid of something like this, then the original play at O3 was wrong.  Although there are many variation possible, fundamentally in the double approach joseki, Black can not keep both sides.  Going back even further, if the threat of White making territory on the bottom is greater than the opportunity for Black to make territory on the right, then Black should have played at O3 instead of R6.]
