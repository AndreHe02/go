C[groden 11k vs coyoc 10k at KGS

Hi!  My name is Terry Wright and I`m a 4k on KGS using the handle "ixiah".   I hope my comments are helpful.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[eq];W[cj];B[po];W[jp]LB[jc:C][oc:B]
[od:A]C[groden: now I was utterly confused, didnt know what to play

Ix:  White has split black here.  The triangle stone is light (it is on the 4th line).  Best  would be a approach move or to split white.  Shown are a couple common joseki`s.]

(;B[lq]C[Ix:  This move is bad because it only grabs six points.  That is way to small for this stage of the game.   Worse is that black is becoming too concentrated on one side of the board.]

(;W[gq]C[Ix:  White should keep on building rather then worry about this stone.]
;B[iq]C[Ix:  This does destroy any chance of a base.  Here black *needs* sente or white will get a huge move up top.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[lp]C[Ix:  Good move by white!  Attaching to a strong group is very useful in making life.]
;B[mp];W[lo]C[Ix:  Here I would go ahead and just split white`s groups.  If he makes life with one the other dies.]

(;B[mo];W[jn];B[in];W[fo]C[Ix:   F5 is greedy and black should be able to punish.]

(;B[cl]C[Ix: The extension is not so good here.   It does not put enough pressure on white and it gains only a few points.]

(;W[dq]C[Ix:  White is playing against strong stones in order to make life.  If he runs then you will get territory.]

(;B[dp]C[groden: this sequence suprised me];W[er];B[fq];W[fr]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[ep];W[hp]
(;B[go]C[Ix:  This is a error--black can make a ko with h3 and if he wins whites corner dies.]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[io];B[hq];W[gr];B[jr]C[groden: k1 was stupid

Ix:  Its a painful loss but dont forget that this is a game amongst us k`s.  You can still come back from this if you play well.]
;W[ir];B[hn]C[Ix:  Here you might want to let the situation just "sit".  The reason is that if you get into a ko fight later on you have a threat that is not easy to ignore. This way you eliminate it helping him defensively.]
;W[hr]

(;B[ch];W[cd];B[cf];W[ej]TR[cl][gn][hn][in][cp][dp][ep]SQ[cj]
C[Ix:  Okay---very important moment here.   White`s square stones are weak and are close to the *VERY* strong triangle black group at the bottom (the two white stones at f5/4 are killable so black is one big group).  Now is the time to attack!!!]

(;B[bj]C[groden: B10 was to connect but I played it wrong, turned out ok anyway

Ix:  This is way to passive.  It also touches a weak stone which helps white (contact with stones makes them stronger).]
;W[bk]
(;B[ci];W[ck]C[Ix:  White is alive now :-(.]
(;B[dk]C[Ix:  This really unreasonable.];W[dl];B[dm];W[el];B[em]
;W[fl];B[ei]
(;W[di]LB[dj:B][cm:A]C[White can tenuki here since A and B are miai.]
;B[dh];W[dj]C[Ix:  White is now over concentrated.];B[bm];W[eh]
;B[eg]C[Ix:  Good move!!  Black does not want to get sealed in here even if it costs a stone.]
;W[fh]
(;B[bd]C[Ix:  The problem with getting sealed is that now you have 9 stones getting about 9 points and are not contributing for the rest of the game.  This is very important because later on black can invade up top and threaten to connect to this live group or make life.]
;W[bc]C[Ix:  Small---it is already alive.]
(;B[be];W[fg];B[aj];W[kc]C[Ix:  Black had to get this in.    Black has to do a invasion now before white consolidates.]
;B[hk]
(;W[gj]C[Ix:  A mistake by white.  The white group here is in no danger.  Better is to build muyo.]
;B[hj]LB[oc:B][jd:A][od:C][rd:D]C[Ix:  Black needs to invade at one of these points.]
;W[nq]C[Ix:  White is very optomistic ^_^.];B[mq];W[qp]C[groden: is this supposed to die?

Ix:  He can get a ko for life.];B[pp];W[qq];B[qo];W[pr];B[or]
;W[rr];B[ps]
(;W[qr]C[Ix:  This was a  serious mistake by white and black did a good job punishing him.]
;B[rp];W[qs]
(;B[sr]C[Ix:  Not necessary---its already dead.];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[os]
(;B[mr];W[kj]C[Ix:  Now white has a giant muyo--this is why losing that move in bottom right was so important.]
;B[ln]LB[oc:B][jd:A][od:C][rd:D]C[Ix:  Very small.  White is already alive so this does not help.  Black must invade at one of  the spots shown before white consoldiates further.]
;W[kn];B[lm];W[ih]C[Ix:  White continues to seal black off.]
;B[ql]C[Ix:  Extending from strong group again >.<.];W[rk];B[ok]
;W[oj]TR[ih][rk]SQ[ok][ql][lm]C[groden: felt I had to invade now, maybe p17 or something would have been better?

Ix:  The problem is you have made several moves which have hurt your invasion.   See how the trade of the triangle stones for the square ones has made it more difficult?]

(;B[mi];W[mk]TR[mi]C[Ix:  One thing to keep in mind is that the triangle stone is not a group.  You can invade elsewhere and threaten to connect up with it later.  See var.]

(;B[ml];W[mj];B[ji];W[hl]TR[hj][hk]C[Ix:  Dont hesitate to sacrifice these 2 stones if you can get good compensation.]

(;B[il]
(;W[ij]C[Ix:  White makes some mistakes in here.  Better for him is to keep black seperated.]
;B[jj];W[ik];B[jk];W[jl]C[Ix:  A blunder.];B[ii];W[im]LB[ik:A]
C[Ix:  Not defending at A was definitely good!!  Here I think g7 is best.]

(;B[hm];W[ik];B[gl];W[il];B[ki];W[fn]C[groden: didnt see this :(]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[gk];W[kk]C[Ix:  When faced with this sort of thing the best thing to do is quickly run into the open.  Then try to work your way to the edge.  Useful in escape is attaching to enemy stones.]

(;B[gi];W[fi]
(;B[fj]C[Ix:  This is a very bad move since it makes only a false eye.   Much better is f9.]
;W[fk];B[hh]C[Ix:  This is too slow.  You must claim a lot of space so that two eyes can be formed.]
;W[ig];B[kg];W[ie];B[ke];W[ni];B[mh];W[lf];B[lg];W[mf];B[nh]
;W[oh]
(;B[jd];W[id];B[jc];W[ld];B[jf]TR[jd][ke][kg]C[Ix:  Beware this sort of back and forth "connection" for as white proves---it is no connection at all.]
;W[if];B[ic];W[gc]
(;B[hb];W[gb];B[kb];W[lb]TR[hb][kb][ic][jc]C[Ix:  M15 is better.

On a side note--frequently K19 is better then L19 because it stops white h17 from being a forcing move.  See variation.]

(;B[mg];W[of];B[gh];W[ij]TR[ok][ml][ql][lm][ln]C[groden: here I gave up

Ix:  I have watched a ton of games between players of various skills.  The difference between a 11k and a player several ranks above is not that much.   

Here are the things that you need to work on:

1.  The biggest is easily that you tend to play too closely to your strong groups.     For example the triangle stones you played earned a additonal 10 points or so but gave white a large muyo.  

2.  When facing a sabaki situation you need to move fast, play against enemy stones, and be ready to sacrifice if need be.  

3.  I would highly recommend picking up "Opening Theory Made Easy" by Otake Hideo and "Sabaki" by Yang Yilun (available through Wings Go Club).  They cover these topics.]
