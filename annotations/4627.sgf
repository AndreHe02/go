C[XCM: Hi, I'm XCMeijin, 4k on KGS, though the way i've been playing recently you'd never know. Especially this game, which I won by resignation, only because my opponent made two dangerous oversights near the end. Though i won, i still feel weak. I hope this review may help me get back on track. Thank you!

-XCMeijin

idigo: Hi, XC. This was a pretty interesting game, and though there were a number of simple mistakes (on both sides), I was nonetheless able to put much thought into a number of positions.

In this game, I think there were a few shortcomings to your general attitude. O3 and the omission of C17 seemed in particular to indicate that you suffer a bit from jealous play. You probably need to have more confidence in your own ability to make territory, and be more objective about the scope of your opponent's when deciding where to play, since invading too early can really make the game quite unfavorable for you. Probably related to this jealosy are a few mistakes in direction, and some misunderstanding about how to attack an unwise invasion (such as an unassisted approach on komoku in the low chinese, as in the game).

Maybe it is just that you are 4 stones weaker than me, but your attitude is a little bit 'high-concept', I think. Rather than focusing about playing high or low in response to nirensei, or splitting hairs in yose questions, it is more important to simply play consistent, practical moves throughout the game. 

In general:

1: Focus foremost on urgent plays for the security of groups, especially where they effect two groups at once and/or are double sente. Your opponent's key move is your key move.
2: Realize that it is sometimes possible to treat stones lightly, even in the opening. Sometimes, making a single stone into a group is not very profitable, particulary when it is close to a strong position. Often, there are alternatives. Pay attention to areas where your stones are heavy; where you MUST make them into living groups, in some sense, and hence do not have so many options.
3. Identify the main areas where you can play, and play where you can expect to make the most profit with the least investment. Choose positions in interesting areas; try to make it hard for your opponent to efficiently develop his own.
4. When attacking, or playing stones which can be attacked, identify the area/way in which profit will be generated. Prefer not to play stones which can be attacked for easy profit; cast a critical eye on an attacking move which doesn't clearly help your position in an identifiable way.

I hope that my comments throughout the game help to provide some concrete ideas on how to improve. Best of luck with your recent slump, if you haven't rocketed out of it already... :)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[kc]LB[cf:A][pg:C][pj:B]C[XCM: Low chinese. What do you think? I felt i wanted to keep low in response to white's high 4-4 stones.

Also, could you show me some variations that exploit this position please?

i: There would be nothing wrong with playing the high chinese, either, or approaching at r6 or enclosing the corner, etc. The fifth move of the game is largely a matter of personal taste :)

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'variations that exploit this position', but maybe white most commonly continues around either a, b, or c.]

(;W[cf];B[dh]C[XCM: I just used this pincer out of curiousity. I knew better than to play at C12, because that's in white's influence. But perhaps pincer is not the best move here; what would you recommend instead?

i: Just f16 would be the most normal, most natural idea instead. The low chinese is a territorial formation that emphases the top, so taking your points there is natural. l17 is in a good place to extend efficiently from black's corner.

D12 seems playable, but white will likely get a stronger group.]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[bd]
(;B[cl]C[XCM: Rather than defending the corner i decided to make base. Was this the best way?

i: Absolutely not. This is slack play. W c17 would get strong immediately and leave good followups on either side, but black c17 would have been sente, and protected many points on the top. Therefore, it is too important to pass by.]

(;W[bi]
(;B[cn]C[i: Seems like a slow, heavy idea. Black certainly isn't prepared to take many points this way, and it is difficult for white to make an interesting territory on the right, too.

It would be better to treat c8 more lightly, trying to play toward a bigger area. As it is, you are inducing white to take a position on the bottom, which is larger than the 6 points or so that you can hope for by making a group on the left side.

Note also that when you play at c6, it is very clear that c8 is not in a good place; better at c9, say.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq]
(;B[fm]C[i: Your group is basically alive, and w doesn't yet have any big influence to reduce, so this move is a particularly slow and passive way to spend the initiative. You'd do better to play more actively.]
;W[jp];B[nq]C[XCM: I was just afraid of white's huge swath down below, but now in hindsight i reckon playing along the right side would have been better, as i could've gained a double-wing formation. Thoughts?

i: The right side is both bigger and easier for black. It is too early to invade like this, when the right is still unclaimed. As it is, you are waltzing into the enemies zone of control and asking to form a group there. W will probably let you, but since white controls the environment and has a clear profit area on the right, the price will be pretty high.

W will attack you, since you don't have an easy base on the side; you'd effectively ignored a pincer at k4 at the moment that you invaded.

Anyway, 'huge swath'? It'd take white a couple of moves to get rid of all the invasions, and the framework can't really grow except by extending along the right side. It's a side, certainly, but it's nothing that huge; it's roughly comparable in scope to what black is claiming on the top.]

(;W[qn];B[no];W[oc]C[XCM: I think i failed to fully utilise the low chinese in this game here. Please help!

i: This may become a bit messier than usual since the the left side of the l17 stone isn't a very solid position, but nonetheless, p17 is a bad play. The idea of l17 w/r to the 3-4 stone in the chinese fuseki is that it acts as a pincer against any stone that approaches the corner. Here, w has effectively ignored a pincer, which is not generally such a good idea. White can expect to come under attack, with black putting white in a situation where he must spend many moves to get safe, all of them good exchanges for black.]

(;B[od]C[i: Contact plays like this have a tendancy to settle the shape, since a reinforcing move (e.g hane) by one player generally makes the other player want to reinforce, too. The corner is open, so it is pretty easy for white to make small life. Your attacking prospects will probably diminish greatly as both w and b strengthen themselves.]
;W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[mc]
(;B[qg]C[i: There's no cut at q16, so I'd probably prefer to fix my top side.]
;W[hc];B[ke]C[XCM: I ignored the threat to the corner; should I have done that?

i: Well, it might have been simpler to have fixed before w got in here. It is hard to know for certain what is best without reading it all out, but l15 is probably the toughest, most positive response from black, not allowing white to settle his groups easily.]
;W[he];B[bc]LB[ff:A]C[i: beware that getting out at A is the main move, and black should try to be sure that he gets it.]

(;W[cc];B[cd];W[bb];B[db]LB[gf:A]C[XCM: Haha, this was actually a misclick, but maybe it turned out ok for me, what do you think?

i: If white submits, this may become an effective kikashi to help weaken the h17 stones by removing the sente from slides around f18. White may have difficulty playing at A just now.]

(;W[be];B[dc]C[i: Again, be careful to not end in gote with this sort of move.]

(;W[cb]
(;B[ge]LB[ff:A]C[i: this generally strengthens white, so it is usually better to get out directly if you can.]
;W[hf];B[ff];W[fg];B[eg];W[gf];B[df];W[fe];B[ee];W[gd]TR[mc]
[oc][pc][nd]C[XCM: OK, after the first 50 moves i feel a little lost. Black (me) seems to be here and there, and white seems to be a bit better off. Any thoughts, comments, at this point?

i:You have an opportunity on top to harrass the marked stones, but it is hard to see a very clear way to profit from attacking them (if they live). The white group on the other already has some eyeshape, and black will be running on a neutral area with the l15 stones.

Because of white's invasions, your territorial potential on top was not realized. Both black groups on the bottom were played in areas where they couldn't actually generate much profit for themselves. However, white did not work hard to punish o3, so you have a reasonably good chance to win this game. After you finish with the top, you can maybe look to play around h3, aiming in part at isolating k4. Your f7 stone may come into play, then.]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[nb];W[mb]LB[me:A]C[XCM: Critical oversight by me, i expected white to play M17 for some reason...

Perhaps there's a way to use this? Thoughts?

i: Well, white can't make two eyes on the top anymore, since you can m18 to threaten stealing even the single eye. However, because it is not so easy to see profit in this attack, it may be best to play at A, easing the pressure on your stones, then take sente to play elsewhere.]

(;B[pr]LB[me:A]TR[mb][mc][oc][pc][nd]C[i: DON'T tenuki like this. If white gets n14, he will be able to switch from a defensive to an attacking posture. If you didn't want to risk a running fight with the marked white stones, then you should have just played at A to get out while forcing white to play on the second line, then play at q2.]

i: You didn't have time to play here in the game. You were too busy defending weak stones.]
;B[id]C[i: The white stones aren't so easy to attack, as they have some eyeshape already.]

-XCMeijin

i: I think that with komi included, it is a pretty close game. Maybe black leads by 2 or 3 points, dunno. White was probably more disgusted than shrewd, in resigning ;)]
