C[I am playing black.
My problem in this game was that I didn't quite know how to deal with white's clever invasion.
My positional judgement was wrong, so it would be great if you could give me some pointers on that.
Also my direction of play in the opening was perhaps not so good since I ended up with several small isolated groups. So any help here will be appreciated as well.

Don't be fooled by the final score, it was more or less an even game until white's skillful invasion destroyed my territory. Moves after 168 can be omitted.

Thank you.];B[pd]C[emvae [11k\]: hi];W[ec]C[andsok75 [12k\]: hi]
;B[pp];W[ep]TR[ec]C[First off-  marked stones show that W is overly ambitious. you should use these moves as an indication that this will be a fighting game.]
;B[pj];W[nc]
(;B[ne]LB[ce:A][gq:B]SQ[nc]C[As W is building a large framework, B should not fall far behind. I suggest A or B here. Your move is find, but you should know that while it put pressure on marked stone, it does little for overall board development.]
;W[jd]
(;B[cd]LB[gq:A]TR[pp]C[i think A is better, as you will be playing it from position of strength (you have marked stone to fall back to. With C16 you are completely on your own.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[cg];B[bf];W[bg]
(;B[de]C[First big mistake];W[ef]TR[de]C[marked stone helped W get a better shape and as friendly as we are helping your opponent is not good. the problem is that you still need to make another move to settle in the corner.]
;B[dc];W[ee]CR[ec]TR[de]C[Again, marked stone slowed down your development and forced W to make **2** good moves. While corner is settled - you spent 2 moves where 1 is needed AND helped W get better shape.]
;B[eb]LB[dg:C][dk:B][co:A]TR[pp]C[Too small. Consider A or B instead. Cutting at C may work as well as ladder breaks by marked stone.]
;W[fc];B[fb]LB[dk:A][co:B]TR[df][ef][bg][cg]C[ok move, but timing is not good. Because of marked wall, invasion is needed along A or B]
;W[gb];B[cn]C[I arroached the 4-5 stone at C6, as opposed to C5 for instance, because I really did not want to be shut off in the corner. I wanted to extend along the left side.]

(;W[cl]C[W responded correctly.]
(;B[cq];W[el]C[correct direction by W]
(;B[gq]LB[en:A]C[I think I made a big mistake here, H4 would have been better. The move I played is too low and allows white to press down on it and, hence, helps white to build a big moyo in the center.

******
2 problems here.

1. stones are too far apart.
2. flow is not natural. Remember in the beginning W acted as if territory to it is of lesser importance then influence. It has been consistent so far. Understanding this, you should make an effort to reduce W's ability to do so.

3. I would suggest A  here instead of marked stone.]
(;W[dq]C[This is not the best move by W, but is is anxious to punish you more then to play the right move. His spirit of a fighter shows again.]
;B[cp];W[en]C[Yup - he cought up. BTW, i am reviewing the game as it goes along - i actually don't look ahead.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[dp];W[eq];B[jq]C[Nicely done.];W[ho]C[Again - W shows correct direcion of play.]
;B[jo]C[And you do too.];W[qp]C[I am not familiar with this invasion, I don't understand why white played it instead of san-san.
Perhaps w just wanted to start complication.

this is a call for special joseki, where W wants you to choose the side to keep so it can take the other side.]

;W[or];B[pn]LB[jo:C][gq:A][jq:B]C[with this move you are weakening B and C stones. Part of the problem is that A is too far away from B]

(;B[km]C[lack of purpose here];W[kl]LB[km:B][gr:A]C[A concerted effort by white to shut me off from the center again. I saw what he was doing of course but tactically speaking it was too late. After he played H2 my strategy was to settle this group quickly and then get out in the open. I did not want to run right away because I knew I could make two eyes locally.

*********
You thinking is correct but your actions in a game are a bit inconsistent. make life with A instead of B and move on to center.]

(;B[nh]C[I played here to let white live inside and build a wall facing the center. This wall would riun much of white's moyo I thought.

close his center moyo converting it into territory.
