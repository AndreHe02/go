AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Obvious problem at the beginning. But I only see them when it is to late!
My
area becomes smaller and smaller and I can't intrude at my opponents. I'd
like to have some general advise cause this problems are always the same.

Hi.
That
was an interesting game. I hope my comments will help you to improve your
Go. Please keep in mind that my suggestions may be wrong, afterall I am not
a Dan. ;)

Summary:

You were quite ahead in this game. You lost,
because of some endgame/reading mistakes in the top left. Nothing too serious.
Improve your reading ability.

Some more suggestions:

- Take the initiative. Don't let White push you around.

- Play moves with more than one purpose

- Play moves  wich have good follow-ups

-
Territory is first build in the corners, then on the sides. And it is easy
for white to invade if all stones are placed on the fourth line.

- Do not try to defend imaginary territory. Find the weaknesses in your opponents groups and exploit them to gain an advantage.
You should build territory indirectly while attacking.

- Take your time and think before you place a stone. Unnecessary moves hurt you.

-
To improve reading and feeling for good plays: solve small problems (tsume-go)
Try to search the internet for problem.sites or buy a book]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[----------
This is a very good start. :)
Your move is influence oriented and puts pressure on White.]
;W[pj];B[jp]C[----------
This is certainly a big point.
Another idea is to improve your group at the top with a play at K17. This would also develop D16.

But
I think your move is ok. Nevertheless, you have to expect to come under pressure
when White plays at the other side of your corner group. E.G. at K17 or M17]
;W[qn]
(;B[np]C[----------
Hm.
This move is locally ok, but I do not like that all stones are high on this
side of the board. It will be very easy for White to invade here.

With your stone at K4 another joseki is better. See the variation.]
;W[cn]
(;B[fp]C[----------
You like this move, don't you? ;-)

Now
you place another stone on the 4th line. With more stones and some developed
influence I suggest to take the initiative and e.g. pincer the white stone.

Play moves with more than one purpose. See variation];W[dj]

(;B[dg]C[----------
Don't play all of your stones high. You may want to build some territory on the sides, too. :-)]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[fc]
(;B[dc]C[----------
Should make the corner safe. But I think this is too passive. Take the initiative.]
;W[je];B[ke];W[en];B[hp]C[----------
ok];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[----------
This is a mistake.

The rule is: cut where you can cut!
You
make it too easy for White. All your places on the fourth line should have
been played to gain influence. Do not try to use them to build territory
in the first place. Use them for attacking and making territory in the process
of attacking.

See variation];W[qp];B[po];W[rn]
(;B[nm]C[----------
This may look big. Hm. I'd suggest to attack the weak white group in the upper left or at least close your corners.

There will not be very much territory made by either side. Bith players have stones in the center...]
;W[pn];B[on];W[ol];B[jj]C[----------
What is the use of this stone?

If you wnat to fight in the upper left (for example with the cut, it may come in handy...]
;W[of];B[ll]C[-------
smaller than closing corners

Do not try to make territory in the center directly if this is what you are trying to do :)]

Good.

I
kept wondering, why both of you played all these other moves. The corners
are really big. They don't look big, but they really are.];W[qd]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[qb]C[----------
Or cut.];W[rb];B[pe];W[pf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[sd]

This situation calls for playing a Ko. It would be in favour for you. Nothing to lose.

This is the right spirit.

gain even more influence. Do not try to defend imaginary territory. Instead,
try to find the weaknesses in your opponents groups and exploit them.]

(;B[cj]MA[cl][dl][dk]C[----------
Pincer White. Put pressure on him and develop D16. In the fight, both of your positions will improve.

There is more than this pincer. Some others include the marked points.]
;W[fq]C[----------
Don't be afraid of a second approach.];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo]C[----------
Play the same moves as suggested earlier. Both white groups are very weak and you can take your advantage out of it.

Of course you have to attack and continue to put White under pressure]

(;B[pn]C[----------
This is a very common joseki. The main variation goes on like this...

This Joseki will also improve White's shape. But I think it is a fair trade. And you take the initiative.]
