C[Here are the general issues I would like to address in this game:

Fuseki:  after we cover the four hoshi, I don't really know where to go.  And how do you stay out of small, endgame-style fights during fuseki?

At some point (in this game, it's around move 111, the large unclaimed territory in the center gets fought, and I don't know how to fight for it very well.

Lastly, I think I have a tendency to abandon groups too early.

Thank you in advance!!

druid@psu.edu];B[dd]C[Hi, I'm Eoghan, aka the AcidCasual.  It seems like it's traditional to start any GTL review by explaining that the reviewer himself is a player of meagre talents and that his analysis and advice should not be treated as gospel, and far be it from me to make an exception of myself.  I'm around 14k AGA/KGS/DGS which means I know next to nothing about this game so if something I say seems stupid or outright wrong, it probably is.

I hope this review doens't come across as being overly negative...mistakes are easier to spot than good plays.  Good play usually looks very natural and obvious...afterwards.

I'll preface my comments "AC:"

Nowe read on....];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp];B[jj]LB[nc:C][qf:D][dj:A]
[pj:B][jp:E]C[Fuseki, I think, is one of my weak points.  After WQ4, I'm not sure what to do with sente.  This move is, I think, somewhat greedy.  Avarice was a problem for me throught the game, I think.

AC: This move certainly isn't commonplace although I would't exactly describe it as greedy.  It's more common to play closer to the edges of the board where it's easy to make territory early on...K10 may come in useful later but it's way too early to say.  

I would say your main options here would be:

1: Play around D10 - this is an extension from both D16 and D4 and starts to create a moyo on the left side.  Equally you might play around Q10 to prevent white from doing the same on the right.

2: Play an approach move to one of the white corners - playing C or similar should develop a position along the top.  Playing around D will break up the right side for white but he will probably pincer you so be ready to fight.

3: Play an extension along the top or bottom side.];W[pj];B[jd]
;W[jp];B[qc]LB[pc:C][qd:B][pf:A]C[AC: right now, I would think D10 is a bigger point.]

(;W[pf]C[AC: the standard response for white here would R16 - see the variation for how that works out.  White's actual response should result in you getting more territory.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[od];W[pe]C[AC: this is a very good result for you...you get most of the corner while white has little to show for it.]
;B[in]C[Looking at this again, I'm suspicious that d10 or such would have been a better move.

AC: D10 is certainly a better move - probably the biggest point on the board right now.  I would also consider making another move to shore up your group in top right.

J6 exerts no pressure on white - he can easily extend along the lower side to G4 and the big gap separating D4 and J6 will become very apparent.  Although it may look like black is enveloping two-thirds of the board, the black stones are very loose and white will have no trouble invading.]
;W[lp]C[AC: again white lets you off easily with a very defensive move.]
;B[ko]C[AC: this move does little to help you - in fact it makes white stronger as he will inevitably play L4 and you will be left with a lone stone clinging to a wall of three white stones.  This is a classic example of a thank-you move...one where your opponent should thank you for making it.  

A move around H4 would have more going for it, preventing a white extension along the lower side, and bringing J6 into the game more.]
;W[kp];B[jn];W[jo];B[kn]C[AC: so now playing L5 has led you to this position - white has a strong position on the lower side and is free to push into it.]
;W[io]C[AC: This is very slow...white should really think about jumping a couple of spaces to G4 or G5.]
;B[ho]C[Here, what I'm concerned about is a white wall starting from j5 and moving left.  However, I left myself open for a cut here.]
;W[hn]C[AC: This cut is not such a big deal really...you should just extend to G5...the white stone will be isolated and white you will not be in danger of being captured.]
;B[hm]C[AC: The atari is not always a good option...you are forcing your opponent, it's true, but are you forcing him to do something that helps you or hurts you?]
;W[gn]C[Now white has escaped, and I'm not sure how to recover from this.]
;B[gm];W[fn];B[ip]C[Here I've let him cut far too far into my territory, and d4 seems pretty lost and alone.

AC: well, it was only potentially your territory....

D4 isn't really in serious danger yet but a play at D6 or F4 would certainly have firmed up you position.

J4 is bad news...it's very unlikely that this stone will survive, played so close to strong white position.]
;W[hp]LB[dm:A][go:B]
(;B[dm]C[An attempt to save poor d4.  Perhaps d6 would have been better?

AC: Either is fine I think.  

You could also play at G5...the ladder does not work];W[en]
;B[dn];W[do]LB[co:B][eo:A]
(;B[eo]C[AC: I think you must play C5 here];W[co]C[And at this point, it looks like I've just let him complete his wall that I was afraid of.  I think this all goes back to my response at h5, or g7.]
;B[bn];W[cp];B[ep];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[bp];W[fo]C[AC: you can't escape from this...better to cut your losses and play elsewhere.   There's still plenty of unclaimed space on the board.

A move at B5 forces him to capture at F4, then you can play freely else where...D11 maybe.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fq];W[fr]C[I think this sequence, ending here and beginning about 20-30 moves earlier, is part of what lost me the game.  At the beginning, the lower left had strong potential for me, and I lost it entirely.

AC: You're still very much in this...hang in there and see what develops.  You make a few mistakes, you're opponent will probably make just as many.]
;B[qq]C[This was an act, I think, of desperation; trying to collapse his territory in the corner and get a strong moyo for myself between d16 and r3.  I don't think it was the appropriate answer.

AC: not an act of desperation at all - it's a perfectly cromulent move.  A  lone stone on the 4-4 point is always open to invasion at the 3-3 point.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[op]C[AC: Again white is being generous - the standard move would be P3.  I would keep pushing for at least one more move.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[sp];W[qo];B[or]C[AC: Don't sell yourself short...take P3.  It's one line higher.]
;W[mr];B[so];W[sn];B[rq];W[rn];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[ms]
C[AC: don't bother with this move right now...it's an endgame move, worth only a few points.  White can do little to hurt you here.]
;W[ls];B[ns]C[Here I've staked out some nice territory for myself, I think, but i've wasted a lot of time.  This is another one of my chronic problems, during the beginning of the game, I get lost in small moves instead of big ones.

AC: Well, it's not so bad really...white has lost about thirty or forty points here and you've come out of this with sente...it's true that the right side is pretty much white territory at this point but you still have very good potential.]
;W[lr];B[dj]C[AC: Finally...];W[dk]LB[mg:A][ek:B]C[AC: I wouldn't take that lying down...E9.  Attacking his weak stone will build your strength.]

(;B[mg];W[ff]C[This situation (f14 and d9) is a long-standing problem with me.  I have a very large territory staked out, but I don't know how to handle invasions.

AC: You have a large territory staked out but one of the golden rules of go is that you don't get to keep it all.  When white pulls something like this, play moves that will start converting potential territory into real territory while making it hard for him to establish a base (eyespace) for his  invading stones.  I think D14 would be a good solid response - it starts to secure the left side and strengthens D10.]
;B[nl]C[The sequence beginning here is my attempt to delay dealing with the upper left, and forcing him to play as small as I can in the lower right, trying to drive his territory against my wall in the lower right.

AC: I think it's more important to take some territory of your own while beating off white's invasions.  His invading stone is surrounded...make it run and take profit while you do so.  That lower right area is unlikely to become much territory for anyone with two walls so close to each other.]
;W[ol]C[AC: when white attaches here he just makes you stronger.]
;B[nk];W[ok];B[oi];W[ph];B[pi];W[qi];B[oj];W[pk];B[lm]C[AC: too cautious...dive straight in there at 06.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[om];B[og];W[pg];B[rd]C[AC: Save this for the endgame...you have a good strong wall in the middle of the board.  Push white's F14 stone towards it...]
;W[re];B[se]C[I think this diagonal form, t15, s16 and r17, is very weak, and I found no way to protect it.

AC: yes, it's pretty bad news...play S17 or T17 instead of T15.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[sd];B[sb]C[AC: Another endgame move...if white wants to play T18, let him...you could be making much bigger moves elsewhere.]
;W[sc]C[AC: bit of a blunder by white...I'm sure you spotted later that you could just capture by playing S16.]
;B[qb];W[qf];B[iq]C[this is me thinking that I can cut his territory in two in the lower border.

AC: It's important to keep in mind that the E4 stones are dead...imagine the board without them on it and you'll see that J3 doesn't offer a lot of hope.]
;W[hq];B[cr];W[ir]C[here I've given up on the cut...was that premature?  I think I have a tendency to abandon stones as dead before they really are.  Those stones are certainly dead now, but I don't know if they were in move 105.

AC: not premature in the least...letting go of stones that are doing you no favours is an important lesson to learn in go.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[es];W[de];B[ee]C[At this point, I've deicded that I'm going to have to deal with the upper left and the center.  I find in all of my games that there comes a point where the edges are pretty much claimed and the center remains.  I don't have a good concept of how to move into the center at this point, and I think it shows a lot in this game.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[ed];B[ce]C[AC: White should not let you capture D15 so easily...the shape your four stones make is called a ponnuki and is a very strong shape.]
;W[fe];B[de];W[eg]LB[dg:B][eh:A]
(;B[eh]C[This move invites him to push through...better to keep playing along the fourth line]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[fh];B[ei];W[ej]C[AC: his ladder doesn't work - it's probably worth playing out of it.]

(;B[fd];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[id];W[jf]
;B[ke];W[kf]LB[le:B][lf:A]C[AC: You should just extend  to M15.  M14 allows him to cut.]

(;B[lf];W[le]C[I think what I see now that I didn't while playing, is that I was too focused on playing under him.  I think my position on the outside was strong enough to pincer him against my position on the corner.

AC: Bear in mind that playing under him as you describe it is making you a lot of territory whereas his string of stones in the middle of the board gets him very little.]
;B[kd];W[mf];B[lg];W[nf]C[Now, the moyo in the center that once was mine is his.  Again, I think this is mainly due to the way I kept playing under him, instead of cutting into the center.

AC: He has no moyo in the centre, any more than you have one...actually, his centre stones could conceivably die yet if he doesn't play carefully.]
;B[of];W[ng]LB[nh:B][oh:A]
(;B[oh];W[nh];B[nj];W[oe];B[ne]C[AC: better to extend to O16...the P11 stones are cut off no matter what you do but should have no problem making life.  Defend your territory above.]

(;B[ek]LB[fi:A]TR[eh][ei]C[At this point I give up the marked stones as dead.  Again, I question that decision.  Perhaps A would have been a better move here, instead of e9?

AC: the variations following from F11 seem okay.  I'm not wild about E9...C10 seems like a better move to me.  If he doesn't capture the two stones after that then F11 becomes a better option.]

I think you were in a very good position in this game but didn't quite manage to capitalise.

The biggest thing I would have to say to you is "corners, sides, middle".  Play the corners first - that's where it's easiest to make territory.  After that play on the sides, and finally the middle.  It's hard to hold on to territory in the middle...you have to seal it off on all four sides and if you leave the slightest chink, your opponent can worm in there and wreck all your hard-earned territory.

Don't count your chickens until they're hatched - your comments give the impression that you think you have territory when all you have is a few stones scattered around the board...then you seem a little downcast when your opponent elbows his way in and makes himself at home.  It isn't territory until you can defend it against any conceivable attack.  

A big part of learning to play go is learning when you should respond to your opponent's move and when you can safely play elsewhere.  Both players in this game make many moves that are either very small and not worth responding to or that do nothing at all.  Often the opposing player responds in the same area, so little is lost but the sooner you can cut down on the small moves and concentrate on making the big ones, the quicker you will improve at this game.  A fair rule of thumb is that moves on the second and first lines are probably endgame moves.  Think twice about them before you make them early in the game...think about how much difference it would really make if you didn't play them and played elsewhere instead.

Don't be afraid to give up stones if they're going to be expensive to hang on to...often you can give up a sacrifice a couple of stones and make other nearby stones strong while your opponet faffs around capturing them.  And remember, until those stones are off the board, they may still have potential that allows you to make forcing moves against your opponent.  Use your half-dead stones as a threat.  

I guess that about wraps it up - your biggest mistakes in this game all seemed to involve letting your opponent push though holes in your formations.  Sealing those holes often seems like a pretty small move but if it saves a pile of territory, then you'd better make that move and the sooner the better.  Let him be the one battering his head against your impregnable defenses, instead of you running around trying to plug a dozen holes at once.  When your opponent pushes into your territory, usually it's easier to stop him if you don't attach directly to his stones.  Attaching to his stones is like hammering jelly...he'll just scoot off into whatever space you leave open.  Think about catching him in a loose net instead.

Apart from that, keep your nose clean, don't take any wooden nickels, and listen to more Dexys Midnight Runners...they truly were celtic soul brothers.
