(;B[dq]C["vernon: Is this wise, or is the 4-4 better?"

I think at this point in the game, you should make a move on the outside of the white territory. Often with moves such as e5, the player is merely wanting the outside influence and inviting their opponent to invade so they can push them into the corner or side. If you create some sort of area outside, then perhaps this can help your invasion later. [see variations\]]

(;B[po]C[I think this move is fine, you could also layout more framework on the right and invite a pincer if white moved to this corner. [see variations\]]

(;B[cp]C[I think this move limits your eyespace and is not particularly good shape. [see variations\]]

(;B[pe]C["vernon: I debated between this and Q9, which would push the lower right into the middle. Or should B shoulder hit also with M5?"

I think that this particular move [q15\] is small. Right now you are trying to get a foot into the middle ground, so that is what you should focus on. 

q9 would be good, I think. It helps solidify your large corner and keeps white from completely keeping you out of the middle. m5 doesn't seem useful to me in this situation. It is sort of floating about, not really threatening your opponent nor gaining anything for yourself. [see variations\]]

C["vernon: I wrestled with whether to keep the corner and be sealed in or take a ponnuki on the side with some reach into the middle. I chose the ponnuki."

I think the ponnuki here was the better choice. A chance in the middle and some territory in this area far outweighs the small territory that would be gained in the corner with no chance for expansion.]

(;B[lc]C["vernon: I feel that B was inconsistent here. Either O14 should help the center or it should help the attack on the upper side. B starts to try to reduce the center, but then shifts to the upper side."

Yes, I agree. Black is inconsistent here. I think the center is more important than the upper side. [see variations\]]

C[I think that in this game, you should have tried to see where you could reduce by extending out from already-existing groups [such as along the right and top sides\]. It would be more successful than simply trying to make a group live in the center. Also, try and make some good shape. Good shape can help your groups live and also be able to attack your opponent's groups later on. There are some good shape articles on www.gobase.org. If you need further clarification feel free to contact me.]
