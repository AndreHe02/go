Ranked AGA 5 kyu 3 years ago.
I now play infrequently, and don't know my real strength.
Any comments/questions/corrections, please send me email.

--richard];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[gc];B[dj]C[Probably OK, but it seems to me that Black is a bit thin here, maybe trying  to jump farther than he can?]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[I would play on the 4th line (Q6) because my stone in the upper
right corner (q16) is also on the 4th line.
But, then again, all of black's other stones are on the 4th line, and
most of whites are on the 3rd line.  So maybe 3rd line is the correct
play.];W[pr]C[This move concludes all fun in the corner, and leaves Black
happy.  Instead of this move, use your stone at D4 and play at K4.
Then, later white can play moves such at R3 and try to steal
the corner from black.];B[qq];W[kq]C[Local Joseki is ok, but look at your D4 stone all alone.  Play
at K4 instead.];B[cn];W[co]C[This move helps Black build nice influence on the left side.  Instead,
pull back to F4.  If Black takes the corner, white will have territory
on the bottom.];B[dn]C[Black is now very very happy on the left side.]
;W[fo]C[Too early for 5th line play.  Extend along the bottom (F4) Or if you
are brave, look at the upper right corner.  I would play F4]
;B[qf];W[nc]C[Another spot to play would be Q10, forcing the black right
hand side into a low position.  The corner (3,3 spot) is still open
for attack, and the prospect of big white territory on the top is
very slim because all of whites stones are onthe 3rd line.]
;B[lc];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[od];W[qb];B[rc];W[nd];B[ic];W[cd]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[bn]C[This is the wrong place for White to attack.  It is not protecting
the corner (still open around G3 or D2) and it forces black to make  a huge territory on the left side.

Instead, pop out near O14, or O5.  Maybe even take Q10 and
reduce blacks right side.  Another good spot would be around  K16, puttinging some pressure on blacks upper group.

In reviewing the whole game, I would pick this as "the loosing move."
White's gain is very small, and the solidity of black is very good.  White
needs to be more concerned with the upper group and the right
side.];B[bm];W[bo];B[le]C[Black makes his upper group stronger, whites upper right group
weaker, and breaks the ladder.  This is a good move for black]
;W[ne];B[pj];W[og]C[Black is forcing white to try and live, while black is making good
territory on the right side.

At this point, it might be worth considering abandoning the upper
right group of stones, and use them to make a group around the
P13 stone?  But it will be hard to make up this loss.];B[ph]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[mf];B[hp];W[gq]C[This move tries to defend the corner.  It might be a better idea
to try and isolate the H4 stone by playing somthing like H5 or  G6.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[eo];B[gp];W[do]C[White takes 3rd line territory.  black can flee.]
;B[em];W[gm]C[This is good.  But you might want to try a different sequence.  By playing
a stone around K4, you will force black to try and jump out.  Then
you can play your G7 stone, and it will have more of an attack feel.]
;B[fq];W[er];B[gr];W[iq]C[I like to put off forcing moves like this one.  It really doesn't gain White
very much, and Black is assured 1 eye.  Hold off on this, and try to contain
black on the bottom.  Better to make him live small than to let him escape
into the center];B[hq];W[ir];B[hn];W[gn];B[ip];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo]
;B[in];W[bl]C[This is a neat trick move, but not enough setup has been done yet.
You really need a stone at G8 or so for this to work.  Better to play
at L6 and make black run into the center.];B[am];W[cl];B[cm]
;W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[fm];W[fk];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck]C[Here, White has 2 choices, play the Ko or sacrafice C8 group by playing
at C10.  At first glance, it seems to me that white wants to avaoid a Ko
fight.  Also, if White makes a small wall starting at C10, the Black
stones connected to B15 will be weak.];W[dm];B[gl];W[en];B[dl]
;W[cj]C[Good!];B[bk];W[dm];B[me];W[oe];B[dl];W[jd]C[ladder breaker for D10 stone as well?]
;B[al];W[di]C[Good.  It would have been nice to have a stone at B10 as well, but
this is good.];B[ie];W[ei]C[Always capture the ladder.  It makes your shape stronger.  Later, black
can peep at F10.];B[je];W[hd];B[id];W[fd];B[bj];W[ci]C[If white would have captured D10 earlier,  White could ignore this move.]

;B[kk];W[jj]C[Black and white are now both connected, and the groups are both
not out of danger.];B[ee]C[No more comments from here to the end (unless requested later on)
White seems to follow black's moves from here until the end of the
game.  To me, its pretty obvious that black is very much in the lead,
and can relax the rest of the game.];W[fe];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf]
