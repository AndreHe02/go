C[Dear reviewer,

This is the first game I submit to the gtl. I have black in this game.

Although, I was able to win the game in the end, I didn't (and still do not) understand a lot of this game.
After the opening, I had a lot of influence, but I don't think I used this in the best manner.

Alle comments are therefore welcome.
Basic time was  1 hour + 20 stones in 5 minutes byo-yomi. I entered byo-yomi rather soon (around move 100), therefore I only included the first 130 moves.
I included some questions denoted with [tomc\], but since I'm rather clueless all remarks will be appreciated.

Remarks about general things, books you think I should study are also welcome. (So far, I have not really studied a lot, but starting with this game would be nice :-) )

Thanks in advance.];B[qd];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dp]
;W[qp]C[[tomc\]: I usually don't like these kind of moves from the hoshi because Black happily plays P4.
It is of course possible, but I would prefer to play either D14 or Q4/P3/Q3, what is your opinion?

[donal\]:I agree except:
I would not play white B yet, because the lower right corner is bigger.
I would not play black A, because a white pinching move from the left is rather severe. Playing farther to the left makes for an easier game emphasizing the black framework on the left side.]

(;B[op];W[oq]C[[donal\]:White is playing a very tight territorial game, but I would be worried that Black will become too thick in the center.]
;B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jp]C[[tomc\]: I looked up the joseki and apparantly it should be low as this is fragile to invasions at M3 or M2? 

[donal\]:I like the high move here as it works well with the black stones on the upper left, making a framework that looks like it might be difficult for Wihite to deal with. Be careful of learning too many joseki, as they can mislead you.]
;W[od]C[[tomc\]: as White, I would prefer to play D14 now, as this seems too soft on Black?]
;B[df]C[[donal\]: I think the key point here is around C8. 16 and 17 aren't bad, but as the game progresses you can see that both players start wishing they had a stone around C8.]
;W[dj];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]C[[tomc\]: I think I should have played D16, followed by e.g. F17. My motivation was that I wanted to have sente to play C8 (or around there), but being cut is probably not worth this?

[donal\]:Yes, A was correct, but then since White will presumably defend the cut, you should just extend to the right. You can now either pinch at C or on the upper right. This is very good for Black, which means that White's play on the left side was probably too close to the black stones. Maybe he should have played around C.

Note that if you were trying to get sente to play at C, you could have just played there immediately and left the attachment at the top for later.]

(;W[ed];B[fc];W[dd];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[fe]C[[donal\]:Black's nice wall has been broken and half his stones are under attack. He hasn't gained much in compensation. This is a terrible result for Black. Too bad, because he had an excellent game up to this point.]
;B[cl]C[[donal\]: Good.];W[bj]C[[donal\]: This is good, too.]
;B[ff]C[[donal\]: Giving up the three black stones is probably best. Capping the two isolated white stones looks interesting. This is where White would probably want to play if it was his turn. Or using a shoulder hit to run away while attacking White is another option. This is quite natural too, because White made the decision when playing 30 that he was willing to risk being attacked in order to avoid Black sliding in at 30. If Black could play 30, of course he wouldn't mind giving the three stones up.]
;W[gf]C[[tomc\]: The best I could think of was giving up those 3 D14 stones in exchange for influence. In the game I was rather happy with this, but now I think this was the wrong plan?
I probably shouldn't have played F18 to start with.];B[ge];W[gd]
;B[fd];W[ee]C[[donal\]:White should probably capture instead. I would be afraid to play black 35.]
;B[he];W[ef]C[[donal\]:Here White could atari from the other direction and try to take all the black stones. The actual move lets Black off too easily.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dh];B[ei];W[di];B[gh]C[[tomc\]: is this ok?

[donal\]:This is a great result considering where you were a few moves back.]
;W[cq]C[[tomc\]: is this good timing for the invasion, I find this very difficult to judge. I think that White can still wait with this as Black is not that strong yet?

[donal\]:I think it is better to extend on the upper side and neutralize the influence Black just made there while defending the lone white stone.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[bn]
C[[donal\]:White 56 is not urgent He should extend on the upper side or erase in the center.]
;B[bm]C[[donal\]:Black should not have answered. If you always answer your opponent's moves, he can do anything he wants with sente.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[em];B[cm];W[qc]C[[donal\]: An extension would have been better. Black can still pinch from the left.]
;B[ek]C[[tomc\]: Is this too optimistic? Tenuki is costly in the upper right corner...
[donal\]: Pinching on the upper side is probably better. But this is a fine move because White must now urgently erase the center. Don't worry about the upper right corner. When building a moyo, you must concentrate on that and not get diverted.]
;W[kc]C[[donal\]: This is a great point, but actually two moves on the upper side were not needed, meaning his previous move was partly wasted. As a result, the center is getting huge.]
;B[ic]C[[donal\]: Not needed! White has gotten 64 in sente. There was no decisive attack against Black here.]
;W[rd]C[[tomc\]: I find this a very interesting position, but it is too difficult for me :-(. Black has an interesting (potential) moyo, but white also threatens to make a lot op points in the upper right corner.

It would be really helpfull if you could give some comments on this positions: possible plans (goals) for both black and white.

I think I should play first somewhere on the right edge, but I can not really decide where...

[donal\]:Black should not try anything on the right. White is incredibly strong there and if Black tries to invade he will have to run away into the center to survive. As White chases him it will erase the Black moyo and White will win.

Black's only chance is to make as much as he can in the center.

White should not worry about surrounding the right side yet, because it's wrong for Black to play there anyway. White should carefully try to limit Black's moyo.

Black should peep at Q5, White should connect and then play a knight's move to expand his moyo, while limiting White somewhat.

Black has a hard game now, because of his mistake in the upper right corner, and then failing to extend from the wall he made on the upper side, and finally answering too many of White's moves.]
;B[pj]C[[donal\]: This will likely get Black into trouble, as discussed previously. For example a shoulder hit at P9 will force Black to run, and Black will lose more in the center than White loses on the right..]
;W[ph]C[[donal\]: This white move lets Black get away with it though.]
;B[po];W[qm];B[om]C[[tomc\]: is this too slow?

[donal\]: This is fine. Even if you give up the black stone on the right, it's OK. Just concentrate on the center.]
;W[ni];B[ld]C[[donal\]: There's a huge danger that White just ignores this and takes the opportunity to erase the center. N10 would have been much simpler and better.]
;W[kd];B[oh]C[[donal\]: Interesting. The ladder is now blocked, but can't White's stone in the center escape anyway? Probably an unneeded complication.]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[pg];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[mh];B[nf];W[kf];B[pf]
C[[donal\]: The position is getting pretty complicated, but the result seems to be that White has good chances to erase Black's moyo, and this happened because Black greedily tried to take away White's territory on the right side.

Both players tended to get off track strategically in this game. A little study of the "direction of the stones" would make a big difference. In Japan, I use Go Seigen's book "21st Century Fuseki" which is excellent, but I'm not sure if you can get it in English.]

;W[kg];B[ke];W[je];B[le]C[[tomc\]: More or less around this time I ended up in byo-yomi...]

;W[ca];B[da];W[ej];B[gj];W[fi];B[fj];W[ol];B[pl];W[fh]C[[tomc\]: In what follows I'm not entirely sure of the exact order and I was in time trouble anyway, so I will stop the notes here.

In what followed, White tried to do something inside Black's influence. At the moment White lost on time, all his aji in this center area had disappeared, so I think I was ahead.]
