This Game I have won happily, but there are 2 questions I'm not sure about, you will find them by the appropiate move.

I'm playing white.];W[gg]C[i find it easier to play e5 with white and cut black apart next]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[better c5 which doesn't strengthen black unnecessarily]
;B[eh]C[/?????????????????????????
stupid computer!];W[fh]C[?? way too small
just play d7];B[ge];W[dc];B[hf]C[computer hopeless... should e3 to lock white in]
;W[hg]C[bad! get out at e3 first!];B[ee]C[now black e3 would kill white]
;W[df]C[like here];B[dg]C[shld e3 instead];W[ef];B[cf];W[de]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[ed];W[ec]C[e3 is top priority]
(;B[fb];W[gf];B[he];W[fe];B[fd];W[fc];B[fi];W[gi];B[ig];W[ei]
;B[eb]
(;W[dh]C[bad since it is gote]
(;B[db];W[dd];B[ff];W[eg];B[ch];W[ci];B[be];W[bd];B[bi]
(;W[di]C[Question1:
Is there any move to kill the black stones in the left-down corner???

u shld have played ko, now bklack lives easily with a2];B[bh]
C[this lives too, but not so easily]
(;W[ae];B[af];W[ad]C[this was definitly false!];B[ah]C[now the black group lives]
;W[cb];B[fe];W[ih];B[if];W[bc];B[gd];W[ce];B[bf];W[hb];B[gb]
;W[id];B[hc];W[ic];B[ib];W[ia];B[hh];W[gh];B[ii];W[hi];B[ih]
;W[da];B[ea];W[ca]C[white has no eye, black needs to make one at g9 to leave white dead]
;B[hd]C[terrible];W[ga]C[Question2:
My white stones in the upper right corner live happily, but it seems to me black has played very bad, but in which move???]
