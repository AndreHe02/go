Hi,
this is my first game on KSG, so I'd like to know if I'm bad or terribly bad! ^_^]

TR[bb]C[Olof:
Best to play C18 here, it might not look like it but it's a large move and
it creates more eyespace for white and destroy some for black.]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[op];B[oo];W[od]C[As the up was free, I tried to attack...

Olof:
Best to settle the lower group first. Black has a nice combination of P3
and then either P2 or O4 depending on how white answer.];B[pe]
;W[mc];B[bc];W[bd];B[dc];W[cd]C[Olof: Now you see why you should have played B18.]
;B[pj];W[jp]C[I don't know if i should play here or on the left side

Olof:
Hard decision. You are a little low on this side so a move on the left is
larger but this move strengthens the weak right group so I think it's better.]
;B[pb]C[Olof: This is a very large move by black, nice play.]
;W[jc];B[ib]LB[jb:A][ic:B]
(;W[jb]C[Olof:
better to play J17 first, if black answer with K18 then continue forward
with H17, but most likely he will answer at H17 and the you play K18. (See
vars)];B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[ie];B[np];W[oq];B[mp];W[mq];B[ed]
LB[ck:B][dk:A]
(;W[dk]C[Olof: This is better one line down at C9. This way D3, C9 and D16 form a wave, that wave is a good shape.]
;B[cn];W[cp]TR[do]C[Olof:
This move is joseki but it doesn't work well with the other stones at K4
and D9. I think D5 is best here, it works nicely with K4 to create a moyo
on the right and puts pressure on black at the same time.];B[cl]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[dl];W[ek];B[fl];W[el];B[em]LB[bl:A][fn:B]

(;W[bl];B[bm];W[dm]C[Was there a way of keeping black to go to the right?

Olof:
No but you should care about him doing so, instead chase him toward the right
and build a large moyo (see var for a start)];B[al];W[dn];B[en]
;W[do];B[bo];W[cm];B[co];W[bl]C[Olof: You shouldn't feel bad about this result, it's very good for white.]

(;W[kp]C[Olof: K5 is better.(see var)];B[jo];W[io];B[ip];W[iq]
TR[ho]C[Olof: There is a Go-proverb that goes like this: "Then cut, extend." I think extending here would be better. H5
Be
aware that this will start a fight there black will try to create a life
on the bottom. Stopping him might be hard but you should be able to profit
on the outside.];B[hp];W[hq]C[I know that i should'nt follow like this but I didn't know what to do...

Olof: Maybe H5, this will start a difficlut fight, hard to read out.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[in];W[fp];B[fo];W[eo];B[ep];W[fq];B[gn];W[gi]
LB[ki:B][hk:A]TR[lk]C[I tried to expend the territory on the left

Olof:
There is a problem with this move and that's the black aji on the top, black
can play E14 and destroy a lot of that territory. Better to remove that aji
first if you want to expand here. But it's a very hard aji to remove.

I
think that the first thing you should do is to play B9, this will 100% sure
kill the black group (if black plays C8 instead he is 100% alive.

After
that you should look at the black wall in the bottom. Let's say black plays
L11, now he has a huge moyo. You should try and stop him from getting that.
Jump right in, M9 maybe. There is no way he can capture that stone and most
of the black wall is neutralised.]
(;B[hk]LB[ii:A][ij:B]
(;W[ii]C[Olof: Be a little more aggresive and play K10. This will force black into a lower position. (see var)]
;B[jj];W[ff]LB[he:A][ef:B]C[Is this move okay to protect?

Olof:
I would prefer E14, as it is now black can play there and if white plays
the hane black can crosscut and white will be in trouble.  (see var)]

(;B[he];W[hf];B[fe];W[ef]C[Olof: Good solid move.];B[gf];W[gg]
;B[ge];W[hg]C[Olof: I don't think it's necessary to defend this cut.]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[nc];W[nd];B[oc];W[ji]TR[mj][mk]C[Should I have played somewhere near N12 to expend some more?

Olof:
Right now it's more urgent to reduce the black moyo, your top moyo is small
and easy to invade and if you try to defend it black will only strengthen
his moyo. You should invade, but the problem is finding the best place to
do so. I think N10 or if you are bold N9 is best but I'm not sure.]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[lj]C[I cut to keep black from going up]
;B[lk]TR[lh][mi]C[Olof: Here black should have followed the proverb and extended. N11 or maybe even M12]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[mh];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[ph]
;W[pc]C[I did this to threaten the empty triangle];B[pd];W[na]
;B[qc];W[oa]C[so i can go further

Olof: this is yose moves better to leave for them later, as ko threats for example.]
;B[pa];W[gk]C[this way, I tried to protect my left center];B[gl]
;W[fk]TR[gj]C[Olof: G10 is more solid.];B[hj];W[hl]C[I wanted to play F7 after that

Olof:
This is the start of a desperate atempt to reduce blacks territory. Because
of a few black misstakes you do manage to reduce is slightly but this attack
is way to late. Black has a nice thick possition here now with very little
aji. The attack should have come before black got the top wall in place.]
;B[fm]C[but he saw through it ^_^];W[il]C[so i wanted to cutthe 2 stones above]
;B[jl];W[ij];B[ik];W[kk];B[jk];W[kl];B[km];W[ll]C[i gave up on the stones on K8 and i tried to expend to the side]

C[Olof: Misstake by black, R10 looks like the most solid move here.]

C[Olof: better to play T8 first this is sente.];B[sm];W[sn]

C[I wanted to expend there, so I expeted black to keep me from cutting]
;B[pf]C[that's what he did];W[ri]C[then I attack the stones on T7]
;B[so];W[qh]C[and attack the R11 stone, so I could expend some more on the right]
;B[pi];W[qg];B[re]C[but I saw it was'nt enough

Olof:
Nice try all in all. You did manage to get something out of it in the bottom.
The problem with this attack was it's timing. It came way to late. Black
was already thick here, more luck then anything else if you get something
here.];W[ac];B[bb];W[ab]C[Olof: this is gote. Play sente moves first. R2 and J19 for example (and of cource A9).]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[ob];W[ma];B[hi];W[hh];B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[gh]

Could please tell me where I could improve my play?

I don't know how I can thank you afterward... So if I don't find a way or another :
Thank you very much ^_^

Olof:
I think you played very well. A huge mistake towards the end but that happens
to everyone (with the number of large mistakes I do I should know :-) )

The
thing you need to practise most on is timing your invasions. If you invade
too late the invasion is doomed to fail. But if you invade too early you
will only strengthen your opponent. This is a hard call.

Also remember
the proverb "Then cut, extend". This does not mean that you ALWAYS should
extend then cut but you should consider the option. More the 50% of the time
extending is preferable to playing the atari.

If you have any questions
you can either mail me at mcgreag@ludd.luth.se or ask me then I'm online
on KGS. My nick is Mcgreag, you can find me in the swedish room.]
