C[wb 10k vs. Mikesh 11k on KGS 10.10.03
Result: B+3.5

Dear Reviewer,

I marked some moves, which IMHO were mistakes. Some are quite obvious and were punished in the game. With other I just had some bad feeling. Feel free to find and comment the threethousandfourhundredandfiftytwo I missed. I also added some comments at moves, where I had absolutely no clue what to do next. :(

I'm looking forward to your explanations.

Greetings

(;W[gq];B[bp];W[cq]C[black happy on left side];B[pj]C[and on right!
good beginning by black, thanks to below level moves by white]

(;W[rq]C[not good];B[rr];W[ql]TR[rq]C[should have been done directly
delta (s3) is pure loss]
(;B[lq];W[kq];B[lp];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[nq]C[black is inefficient because he has invested too many stones in the corner]

(;W[qi]C[not right];B[qj];W[qf]C[I find this behaviour of W extremely aggressive. Is it really feasible to play in such a style? (I always loose playing in this way.)]

Q13 better?

to play at contact is never good when attacking, so maybe the other plays are better]

the cut (see var) maybe required];W[ic];B[kc];W[mf]C[now white seems safe & happy!
turning point in game]
(;B[mj]C[Maybe J18 instead?
this move does not work a lot, you are right to wonder];W[nl]

(;B[en]C[Bad feeling with this move.];W[dc]C[good!
now black cannot invade and white controls the quarter north west]

too late!

yes];B[me];W[nf];B[mc];W[kd];B[nc];W[gc]C[There it goes B J18.]

the real mistake goes  back in time!
now you cannot do a lot];W[de];B[eg];W[dg]

some trouble in the bottom group with the (wannabe) wall as
backup? The least possible is some reduction of W at the bottom, I think.]

(;B[do]C[I wanted to add some further support before attack. Was this necessary? During the following exchange W fixed any remaining
weakness.
