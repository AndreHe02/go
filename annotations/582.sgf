C[bene: i think that black(you) and white  played well and reasonably. black made some mistakes around the bottom side and that made a difference.]

;B[qc];W[kc]C[BH: This is a joseki, which I didnt know.
bene: the rationale behind these move is understandable and reasonable. but i think that attack around Q12 is better for black's next move.]
;B[pq];W[cj];B[qm]C[bene: right direction.];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp]

C[BH: This is a Joseki, I do know. S2 makes it Gote for White, so this is probably not so good for white.]
;B[rm];W[oq];B[qi]C[bene: right];W[cf];B[cm]C[BH (black): so far I felt rather well. I do not know, where I lost the match.
bene: because white ignored black's attack at R11, capture of the white stone at P12 was probably better
or, you bad better defend the corner by F17. this move was somewhat idle]
;W[fp];B[hq];W[fr]C[bene: you played well through the game, but made several problematic moves around here.
firstly, H3 is a good attack. but because white stone is light, you need to make F4 to become heavy. (ie, E3 instead of H3?)
secondly, L3 is a good move for stabilization, but exerts little influence towards this white group. i recommend E3-F3-H5 seqence]
;B[kq]C[During the game, I thought, it would be a good idea to erase the influence of whites position on the lower right by playing H3 and L3. The way the game went, I am not so sure anymore. I had to spend a lot of moves, to keep H3/L3 alive.]
;W[cq]C[bene: because you skipped E3, white could happily invade here]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[cr];B[dr];W[bn];B[bo];W[co];B[cn];W[bp]
;B[bm];W[ao];B[fn]C[BH(Black) I still thought, I am leading. Unfortunately my thickness (D2-B7) later became a heavy group.]
;W[go];B[im]C[bene: this is an elegant-looking move. but as the results shows later, i think the direction was not good. i think instead J5 was good
at least, J7 move leaves a weak point at H7. more tight move at H7 was probably better]
;W[io];B[ip]C[bene: this is surely an opponent-helping move. white becomes stronger, and your weakness at H7 is now apparent. i guess that you want to defend the lower group, but i wonder whether this was necessary. if this is necessary, your J7 is surely a bad direction.]
;W[in];B[lo]C[bene: H7 instead? your left group will be weakend after w;s H7.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[hl];B[dk]C[bene: this is a reluctant move. this is a sad situation incurred by w's H7.]
;W[dj];B[fk];W[hj];B[ej];W[bd];B[cc];W[hc]C[bene: white's mistake. F17 will be more severe attack.]
;B[fc];W[pi]C[bene: you should have punished white's tenuki(ignorance) earlier.]

;B[li];W[sq]C[BH: My joseki book says: T4 is correct. But as it is endgame -gote, it might be to early anyway?
bene: i agree];B[lg]C[BH: the  idea was to defend the cut in sente.]

;W[if];B[fo];W[em];B[dn];W[dl];B[dm];W[fl]C[BH: as that would be a rather bad Ko, I played E9 and white managed to be alive. As this is Gote for white, I still considered the whole attack as a success.]
