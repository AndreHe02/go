AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[bignose:  I would like the attached game reviewed.  It is a 9-stone handicap game
played on KGS.  I (bignose) was White.  I've made notes in the SGF file
on areas of the game that troubled me.

As a fellow reviewer, I also have some suggestions to make game reviews
easier to read:

  - Please mark your comments with your name to distinguish them from my
    comments.

  - Please don't use coordinates alone to describe a point on the board;
    this is SGF, you can make marks, letters and numbers directly on the
    board diagram and refer to those in the comment.

  - Feel free to make branching variations if it will illustrate a point
    better.

Naturally, these are suggestions only, and I appreciate the time and
effort to review my game.  Thank you in advance!


I don't often play White against high handicap, but I took this opportunity to do so recently on KGS.  Although I won by 3.5 points, I think my performance was terrible, especially given that the rank difference was greater than 9.

I felt the game giving way toward the end of the middle-game, but I'd like to know if I was correct in thinking White had a strong lead up to then or whether that was an illusion.

The fuseki also went along lines I'd never experienced, and I'd like comments on my handling of Black's poor (I presume) opening.


----------
Jorg: Hi bignose. Your suggestions show, that we do reviews the same way. I also dislike coordinates. :-)

I try my best to make a helpful review, but please note, that my suggestions are my own humble opinion. If a point is not clear, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I will add a small summary at the end of the review...];W[qn]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[po]C[bignose: This move is an apparent favourite for Black, who (it turned out) had never heard why an empty triangle is bad.  I had no real idea how to punish it (it occurs in all four corners).

----------
Jorg: It is a good idea to be patient. Now, there is more room for an invasion around 'a' later in the game.
I think there is no good way to punish him directly, because there is no obvious weakness and you should take care of your own insecure group in the first place. The important point is, that Black's formation is not very efficient. This stone is wasted and gives the initiative to White. You should be happy.]
;W[mp];B[on]
(;W[qk]C[-----------
Jorg: I do not like this kind of move. It is often played by us amateurs but never by the pros. The reason is that Black welcomes this move. See VAR next move.

So play VAR instead.]

;B[sn];W[ro];B[sk];W[sj];B[rp];W[om];B[pk]C[bignose: Already I was flustered; I think I let Black off the hook in this corner and let him lead me around, but I couldn't see an opportunity to play away before this.]
;W[fq];B[nm];W[so];B[ol];W[sm];B[np];W[mq];B[nq];W[jq]C[bignose: Again, I feel I have given Black too much on the right side, so I need to shore myself up before attacking.

----------
Jorg: If playing White in a high handicap game, it is important not to make settled groups too early. A save black group can not be attacked anymore.

You also should not expect a quick victory. It often seems that White is behind, but keep in mind that Black will make a lot of mistakes. So keep on playing, develop fast, play for influence, start fights and rely upon your greater reading strength.]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[kp];W[iq];B[ip]
(;W[dn];B[eq];W[fp];B[ep]C[bignose: Black's second empty triangle gift to White.  I had already played both sides of it so felt I should play away.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[pe]
(;W[qi]C[bignose: Again Black weakens himself and gives me sente. But is this a good use of my sente?

----------
Jorg: It connects your groups safely. I think this move is ok.]

(;B[io]C[bignose: Black misread this ladder badly and we played it out for many moves, causing Black's position to become quite hopeless.

----------
Jorg: By the way. The ladder is to Black's favour. Follow VAR. (But hard to read, I played it out, too) ;-)]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[mn];B[mm];W[ll]C[bignose: As it turned out, the surrounding White stones died later on.

----------
Jorg: I think there are serious reading mistakes from both side involved in the previous sequence.]

(;B[mr]C[----------
Jorg: A mistake. See VAR.];W[lr];B[ms];W[nn];B[ml];W[cp]C[bignose: An attempt to use Black's weakness, but it looks pretty lame to me now.  I don't know how else I should play here though.

----------
Jorg: I don't think this point is too bad.];B[lk];W[kn];B[kk]
;W[jo];B[fm];W[eo];B[fn];W[hl]C[bignose: Too aggressive?  Should I be looking further, or is it vital that I exploit this area now?

----------
Jorg: I think you should take the corner first, with e.g. VAR. The Black stones you are attacking here do not really serve any purpose. Black could as well ignore you here and take a big point in the upper left quadrant.

There is even the danger to strenghen Black's center if he is willing to sacrifice some stones.   Such points are best saved for later.]

W: 11+ 106

You have a big advantage. If you save the corner by playing VAR you should surely win. I wonder how you lost the game. Let's have a look...]

Jorg:

Final score: White wins with 3.5

That was close

There is not pretty much to say about that game. You played well and had a good 80 points lead until you played the loosing move, lost two own groups and a lot of prisoners. It turned out that you won with only 3.5 points. :-)

One important point was, that you did not realize that the upper left group was not yet alive. You made some other minor reading mistakes, too. But nothing too bad.

Your biggest mistake was clearly the misjudgment of the situation in the lower right, where only one wrong move enabled Black to capture 80 points.   I think you played good. You won and Black can be happy, too.]
