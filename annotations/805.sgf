RE[W+9.50]

C[Dear reviewer,

thanks a lot for reviewing my game.
I am Zotan, playing White. My rank is 15k* on IGS and 10k on KGS.
My name is Peter Strempel, you can reach me via <pstrempel@t-online.de>.

This has been a good game for both sides, I feel it was one of the better ones I played lately. So I would like to hear some opinions about it.
In the middle I lacked a bit the ability to see the good moves, as well I think I messed up one corner play a bit. Moves where I was in doubt I have commented.

I won the game with 9.5 points, but had the feeling it was a pretty even game and we both took our chances equally (or missed them).

Hi Zotan,
I play as Grahamq 6k* IGS, GRaham Lamont 2k UK in real life.

This game was an interesting contrast in styles.
W played more solidly whilst B invaded created more groups and aji and generally tried to limit Ws territory.
By move 29 B should win, but B seemed too interested in minimising Ws are rather than converting his powerful moyo.
 because of Ws solidity no W groups were in danger.

W missed 3 big opportunities to kill the game:
1 Killing e7 stones
2 killing j17 stones
3 L14 to make 25pt center.

B missed 2 big opportunities:
1. to follow "winning strategy" after move 29
2.turn low chinese into territory at move 51];B[pd];W[dq];B[cd]
;W[qp]C[I have been experimenting lately with the 4-3 point.
I did not find this opening play for white in the gobase database, so I guess it's not very common.
I always played 4-4 lately, so Im now experimenting a bit with this.]
;B[ic]C[And Black seems to enjoy the chinese opening.];W[dj]
SQ[cp]CR[dg][qf]TR[nd][ed]C[Now I wished D3 would be at C4 instead, then D10 would make a perfect extension.
I know there are other ways to deal with the chinese opening. This seems to be a common way.
But maybe the stone does not work very well together with D3 here, except W would play right into a pincer if he app roaches at D5 or C5.

R
D10 is a big point, but not forcing. D12 looks a ggood response.
The marked red  points are standard points for starting to reduce the low chinese. with typical triangled responses.]
;B[oq]CR[dh][pj][qj]C[I would prefer these pts to emphasise and expand the moyo b4 "invading"]
;W[mq]SQ[lp]C[I like M4 a lot as well here. But I just had a game with aji before and the plays where identical until now, so I thought I should try something else here. :)

R:
Good move. works well with low D3. Builds Lside moyo.];B[oo]
;W[pn]C[aji [11k\]: hey it was a different pincer even];B[lp]
;W[pq]CR[mp]C[R
W should start to cut B.
L side statrs to look big + B Thin.];B[pr]C[So far it seems to be joseki, if I am not mistaken.]
;W[op]LB[ff:B]TR[qr]C[I think this move was not very good.
I should have kept things simple and blocked at R2, see variation.]
;B[np];W[pp];B[nq];W[qj]CR[lq][ed][qf]C[Here I felt I had to extend else that group might get under attack later.
If I had played like in the variation, the white position maybe had been more stable.
So P4 didn't gain W anything here, I think.

R
P4 just strengthened B and took away N4 cut.
B has recovered. W still has M3

Marked pts are more urgent than R10];B[qg]TR[qh]SQ[oj]CR[gq]
[dh]C[Think I should play P10 now or soon.  If B had played at R12 instead, I had played P10 for sure, but here as B is a bit distant, I thought I can tenuki.


R
R13 is ok but is not urgent. It doesnt threat anthing big.

Marked pts are bigger

If B can erase aji of n13 completely and gain lower side this is big.
WP10, doesn't really gain much, there are more urgent considerations.]
;W[co]CR[jq][ed]TR[hq]C[R
 something happeneed with my editor at this node :(
You said something like:
W didnt want to invade at e16 + c5 seemed big.




R:
c5 is slow. locally d5 emphasises relationship with d10.
Red  pts are the urgent ones
c5 ttends to induce h3 from B];B[qr]CR[hq][gq][fd][dh]C[Big point, but I think W R2 before had been gote, as black would probably not have answered as long as the black group can extend to the left side to be safe.
I had liked to play R2 myself, but not now in gote.

R  r2 is 6 pts gote
Marked pts ar 12-15  pts];W[oj]CR[ed][jq]C[Maybe a bit too wimpy? Feared B would now get in around R8 and after B R2 the W clump looks a bit eyeless.
Guess that's suffering from playing P4 instead R2 before in move 14.

R
This is very slow];B[dh]C[ R
Good];W[hp]C[R See previous comments suggesting k3];B[iq];W[hq]
LB[ip:A][hq:B]CR[lq]C[I never know if I should block or play towards the center with those moves.
Maybe I worry too much about my territory, but I would hate it B gobbles everything up to the left until the D line.

R  W should probably play m3 rather than let n3 get swallowed.
Now B has erased n3 aji];B[ir];W[ip]SQ[hr]C[Should I descending another time here instead?

R h2 is locally better yes.];B[dm]C[R
Aggressive but  Good move.
W appears to have little territory and B has LC+ 2 extensions.
B leads by about 20 here
All B needs to do is live d7 and make conservative territorial gains in his upper moyo to win]
;W[fj]C[R  Good idea.  W best chance is to isolate 29];B[fm]
CR[ek]C[R  e9 1st];W[el];B[em];W[hm];B[gl];W[hj];B[hl];W[il]
;B[im];W[ik];B[hn];W[jm];B[in];W[jn];B[jp];W[jo];B[kq]CR[cj]
[ck]C[R
B should be moree worried about his group. eg c9-10];W[ed]LB[io:A]
CR[dl]C[Connecting at A instead looks important. Often I fail to see the difference between urgent moves and chicken moves.

R
48 is correct assuming B alive
But W could try to kill B.
I can only count 1 eye!];B[fc];W[df]SQ[dh]C[Aiming to attack D12 stone.]
;B[cf]CR[ec]C[R
B shoulnt worry about 23 its light
E17 is big and utilises the B moyo
After E17 B has UL corner + Uside
Compare this with what happens];W[ce]CR[de]C[R  52 looks like overplay
B should cut];B[cg]C[B did not follow my plan. Pity. .)];W[be]
;B[de];W[dd];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef]
(;W[cc]LB[ff:A]C[Force once more at A here, and then C17? But I thought B would cut at F16 anyways.
See variation.];B[fd];W[eb]C[Chicken move or necassary?];B[bf]
;W[bd];B[dl]CR[oc][nc]C[R
Big point
B must live now
Otherwise op17 looks very big]
(;W[nc]LB[qc:A]C[I think invading at A had also been a good idea here, as B played the large knight extension.
This move allows Black to get a nice corner. So I think, A had been better.
But on the other hand, then B would get a nice wall facing the top side.

R
With A:Once B confines W to the corner he has a nice side... I prefer66]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[lc]C[ Would be way too nice to let white play L17.

R
Right idea to take Ws base];W[pe];B[qe]CR[od]C[R
B could try p16 instead leaving the cut at o15];W[pf];B[qf]
;W[od]C[Destroying any aji here for the future? But I think W R17 doesn't work here anymore. And I wanted to erase the cutting points in my currently pretty eyeless group.
Q13 also looks like a good point for white.];B[qc];W[le]TR[pg]
CR[ge]C[ Q13 instead better?
Now W has gained strength maybe its time to attack the B upper stones.
Its always a hard call to work out , because if W invests too much effort to killing B and it doesnt work it makes B v.efficient.

If WQ13 BM15 and B has stable stones and W cant convert the moyo to much territory.

Now Q13  gives B choice JK14 or g15 for safety or chance q13 to stop Ws area.]
;B[pg]CR[kb][jb][hb]C[Obviously Black thought as well Q13 had been a good point. :*)

Now W must ataack Bs vital point L18 would be my choice];W[nf]
C[R
Misses point];B[pk]TR[pj]CR[qm]C[Argh. I never know how to handle those moves.
Connect at Q10 or block on the side to get territory?


R
This seems ajikeshi for B it induces r9 which is what W wants
In this area r7 would be better threatening the q10 weakness more indirectly and the r6 cut.]
;W[qk];B[po];W[qo];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[ol];W[ok]C[Bs strategy has misfired 79 has gained nothing]
;B[pi];W[pj]C[Although here I was following black around, I think W got a nice result here.
Some points and the group is even out in the center around P10.]
;B[if]C[R
Good Important to stabilise Bs stones];W[kd];B[kc];W[nh]LB[jd:A]
CR[ff][ge]C[Pushing once more at A would make sense?

Good time to activate the aji on 58, split the 2 B groups and cause some trouble

94 is stable but very slow];B[jd];W[bj]C[Trying to seperate the two black groups, and leave me the option of F14 for later.
I didn't really expect to kill one of both black groups tho.]
;B[ek]C[R
Safe + correct W should reply];W[ej];B[fq]TR[hr]CR[fk][fp][fo]
C[ To be expected I think.
I had liked that point myself, but as W was still open at H2, playing F3 or F4 myself didn't look too attractive. Tho would connect my stones.

R
??
I dont understand B or W here   The middle B group still technically has no eyes  For B simply f9 gives 1 eye and threatens g10 cut.

99 just induces f4 or f5 to split black
Theres not much  territory around here because of the open skirt at h2  Now W has built a wall B has to worry about]
;W[fp]C[R good];B[ep];W[eq]CR[fo]C[R
Should be as marked splitting B];B[gp];W[fo];B[gq];W[gn]CR[go]
C[Umm. Didn't work. I hoped to make H7 a false eye.
But I think going for the kill here is unrealistic, tho W might have some potential after making H7 and E8 false eyes and then trying to occupy the area around B7 first.
No idea, that's too high for me to read it out that properly.

R
G5 looks a good start.
B may survive but W will get profit in sente];B[go]
(;W[ho]LB[fn:B][hr:C]C[aji [11k\]: "Now you boys stop fighting like that or someone is bound to get an eye poked out

Good saying. .)];B[gm]
(;W[eo]LB[fn:B]C[Zotan [10k\]: chicken move

Yes. .) I said it. But during the game I tried to read some other moves, and decided to play this way as I didn't see a good alternative.]
;B[fn]
(;W[io]LB[hr:B]C[Hmm, looks like H2 would not work. See var.]
;B[hr];W[ff]C[Lets try if that works. The group did not look killable. If I play B12 first, black simple plays F14 and should connect.
So I thought this is a bit more promising to force B to make 2 eyes on the left side and preventing black to eat F15 and make territory there

R  Good move See prev.];B[eg];W[gg];B[fg];W[hf];B[bi]CR[gh]
C[R
Unnecessary for B
If W tries to take eye with B12, B replies at C11...else just B12

Looks vclose on the board B needs to look to make or reduce territory

G12 threatens the 4w stones + f10 cut];W[ci];B[bh];W[gh]CR[ig]
C[ Chicken move or necassary to connect this clump?


R  Would be a good move for B. see prev.
Perhaps j13 would be more efficient];B[he]CR[ig]C[R  J13 is big point.... almost into end game now]
;W[fb]C[Dont really know what I was thinking here...];B[gb]
;W[ob]C[R
Big];B[pc];W[mk];B[gf];W[ge];B[gd]CR[ig]C[R
J13 is by far biggest pton boars esp after 128];W[gf];B[hd]
;W[ig]C[R
Yes!
W wins now.];B[ke];W[rh]CR[kf]C[R L14 big point now
136 is  not bad tho];B[rg];W[qi];B[qh];W[og]CR[kf]C[R
small];B[ld]C[R small]
