C[Note to GTL reviewer: I am playing white, and I feel that I have the following problems, so if you could spot them and let me know that would be great:
1. I try to be fancy because I don't know a "normal" move.  Anytime you see an obvious normal move please notate it!
2. When I "attack" I don't seem to profit much.  I know all the ideas of trying to attack in a way that is profitable, but I don't do a very good job.
3. Related to (1), the style of the city of Santa Cruz is full of fighting overplays, so point out where I'm fighting in an unreasonable fashion.

The black player would also appreciate your comments, I'm sure, since he seemed to have the advantage for a long time (and I won by a bit of a swindle).]
;B[cp]C[Hi friends,

My name is Horst, 1-kyu in real life. I'm afraid your questions/topics are a bit difficult for me, but I do my very best.

To make a good start:

a normal move ;)];W[pp];B[dc];W[eq];B[qd];W[de];B[do]C[I would prefer a pincer, may be c 13.  [I am not a good book-learner. I try to let you know my feelings. But I cannot say: It is so, because xy had written ...)]

(;W[ci]C[This is the first move I'm sure is questionable.  I get a bad overconcentrated result from it.  But I wanted to prevent black from getting a pincer/extension combo from the lower left.  It seems my reasoning about when black would get a chance to play it is a bit wrong.

I am afraid, this is the first difficult question for me. The point looks good, I too would have played it.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df]C[There is no problem in this overconcentration. c4, d5 is very calm, too.]

You both played a good game.

You, Kenn seem to think too much about joseki.
Your "feeling" is good, remember my comment to R10
Just follow your feeling. 
If you want to cut, fight it.
Losing the lower right corner was fairly bad.

Ken should concentrate a bit more on possible cutting points in your groups.
You "forgot" to attack the upper white group, that would have been nice for you.

You are nearly as strong (weak) as I, so I hope my review satisfied your wishes a bit.

Keep sente
