C[siegoman is requesting this review

comments by wittel:

would be great if you send me the review of today's game. I just had a look at it, i think my worst mistake was move 153, I played c10, but that was fatal. d10 would not have sealed me in i think. after that i didn't have a concept anymore. if you get a chance, you could also ask your reviewer, how b should continue after move 156, that is w to f10. I have no clue how to continue after that.

d> Hi, I will do my best to review this game, if you still have some questions, please email me.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[df]TR[ce][de][cf]C[d> A bit unusual, shimary should be at C15, D15 or C14]
;W[kc]
(;B[ic]C[d> I think this is the wrong direction you push white on the weaker stone, black should instead push white to the stronger group (however the move at D14 makes top left not as strong as it should be). I would play N17]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[d> This is not very good, you help white to reinforce, and you won't finish sente]
;W[nd];B[ob]C[d> not good to play on second line like this, black should jump at Q14 instead]
;W[jq]C[d> big point, white did good not to respond to P18, however white has to be aware black group on top right is not settled yet, white should play around R14 when possible]
;B[pj];W[ck];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[rq]C[siegoman: with Q10 this seems small.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[gc]C[siegoman: too deep I guess, what are some other options for the upper left corner? or overall board?  goal is to sacrifice territory and gain center influence.  thanks!

d> Too agressive in my opinion, black simply has to play J15 and you get 2 weak groups... hard to get a good result]
;B[ie];W[ge];B[ig];W[ke];B[gf];W[ed];B[dd];W[ff];B[fg];W[gg]
;B[hf];W[eg];B[fe];W[ef];B[ee];W[fh]C[d> good result for black locally]
;B[pf]C[d> a move in that area was indeed necessary, but I would play it at  R13 to have a better balance, this move on 4th line creates a weakness because Q10 is also on 4th line]
;W[fd];B[de];W[eb]C[d> I think black can kill the white group safely, see variations]

(;B[db];W[ec]C[d> white still dead if black knows where to play]

(;B[hd]C[d> big mistake... see variation];W[hb];B[ib];W[fb]
;B[ha];W[ga];B[hc];W[ia];B[ja]LB[ha:B][jb:C][gd:A]C[siegoman: white is trying to keep the cut at G15 and have the group live.
A ( G16 ) : the move I made, relies on ko to work.
B ( H19 ) : the move that gives life, and appears to be sente... threatens both C and A.  defending C is more likely, as D16 is likely to live, and J18 is likely to connect to P18, and make some profit by attacking L15.


d> Well, the problem is that black failed to kill white, this situation should never have happened. With white properly killed, the other white group at L17 would be under great pressure.  The game would have been almost won for black.

In this situation, I would play L18, pressuring the white group at L17 a maximum and relying on escaping to the center to live.]

(;W[gd]C[d> White should be happy to live there, and shouldn't get too greedy, this G15 move is a mistake, white must simply play H19. Even white cut black group, black has more chance than the white L17 group]
;B[ha];W[ea];B[gb];W[qh]C[d> white should first settle the L17 group, by playing R12, he's hurting the L17 group]
;B[fa];W[qe]C[d> white is hurting the L17 group even more];B[qd]
;W[qf];B[pe];W[pg];B[og];W[of]
(;B[nf];W[oe];B[mg];W[kg];B[ph];W[qg];B[qi]C[d> this move is a bit too much in my opinion]
;W[oh];B[ng];W[pi];B[nb];W[mb];B[ne];W[od]

(;W[lc];B[kd];W[jd];B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[kf];B[je];W[jc];B[mi]
;W[qb]C[siegoman: I've been studying too much life and death I guess, but I thought this stood a chance.  R15 and N18 have a few liberties, it seemed the only hope to save them was to kill P18 or R16.
does this corner attack seem reasonable?  thanks.

d> R18 looks like a vital point, I guess there is no risk to try, but I'm not sure black can be killed]
;B[qc];W[rb];B[rc];W[pb];B[pc];W[sc];B[sd];W[oa]
(;B[pa]C[d> I think this is a mistake, see variations, without this mistake the game was almost won for black.]
;W[qa];B[na]C[d> black gives white a ko...]
(;W[sb];B[ra]
(;W[ma];B[pa];W[mh]C[siegoman: black has the choice to keep Q17 group alive, or keep O13 group alive.  I like the center, so I would have saved O13.
black keeps option open to escape with O12

d> if black simply had blocked white at O19 earlier, he would have his 2 groups safe and white N17 group dead.]

(;B[sa];W[nh]C[siegoman: as white I was really happy with this

d> I understand, but it was a very dangerous play, and you have to give  thanks to black's mistakes.]
;B[oj]C[d> Black mistake... black must invade bottom/bottom left before it's too late]
;W[jo]C[d> good move from white, white getting too strong for black to have a chance to win this game anymore...]

(;B[cn]C[d> black should  have played F3 instead, left side is still reducable due to B13. However it won't be easy for black as white has pretty much won the game]

(;W[dn]C[siegoman: as white, my goal was to seal black in the corner, but I may have lost my vision when I saw the undercut at C3

d> if your goal is to exchange some left side territory for a big territory on bottom, this looks ok]
;B[co]C[d> black shouldn't play here, he's sealing himself on the left side, later he will have trouble to prevent white to have huge territory.]

(;W[do]C[d> mistake, see var];B[cp];W[cq];B[dm];W[cm];B[cl]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[dl];B[bn];W[em];B[am];W[bk];B[dm]
(;W[cm]C[siegoman: white played it safe, didn't want to risk the large influence building. in the alternate play it appears C6 could die.

d> yes it seems to be c6 dies too.];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[jj]
;B[ci];W[bh];B[dh];W[dg];B[dk];W[be];B[cg];W[bi];B[eh];W[fg]
;B[fi];W[gi]C[I thought the squeeze by black was excellent, but it stopped, why not H13 now?

d> I'm not sure, it helps white too, so I guess it wasn't so important]

(;B[ei];W[cf];B[bj];W[bf]
(;B[cj]C[wittel: I played c10, but that was fatal. d10 would not have sealed me in i think. after that i didn't have a concept anymore. if you get a chance, you could also ask your reviewer, how b should continue after move 156, that is w to f10. I have no clue how to continue after that.]
;W[ek];B[ak];W[fj]C[wittel asks:
how b should continue after move 156, that is w to f10. I have no clue how to continue after that.

d> at this point black has pretty much lost the game, there are no really reasonable way for him to get a chance to win unless white makes a mistake, however, I see a weakness at D3 that might be exploited, but white better give up 2 stones and prevent black from living. So that won't be enough for black.
See one possible variation, black doesn't get much...

Black had many chances to win this game.

Comments end here.]
(;B[gj];W[hi];B[hj];W[ii];B[jk];W[ol]C[siegoman: this point was a guess, wanted to either separate K9 from N11 or R6 from Q10.  maybe I was waiting for black to do something.]
;B[nm];W[ql];B[qk];W[nk];B[lk]C[siegoman: when black made this move I saw it as a pivital point.  I thought for over 5 minutes on what to do next.  it seems my P8 R8 combo were too deep.]
;W[mj];B[mk]C[siegoman: somehow I felt relieved when black played this.  althought I don't know why.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[li];B[oi];W[lj];B[lh];W[ph];B[kh]C[siegoman: at this point I had just under two minutes to make 15 moves.  so I was trying to play it safe, and not lose on time.
wittel was also short on time, 3 minutes for 9 moves.];W[jh]

;B[ml];W[im];B[ij]C[siegoman: I thought I could ignore this, having J12 and M12 capture to fall back on, removing eye space for M6 seemed bigger.  at the time I did not notice, but I could sacrifice F14 and B14 and maintain the cut at G10.]
