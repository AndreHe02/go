C[Hi Brannon,

My comments will begin with [A\]. 
You will find general comments and advice on the last move.

Feel free to contact me by e-mail for any question about the review.

And finally, keep in mind that my comments are just my opinion and not uncontestable truth.

Hope it helps,

So far, both players have chosen a peaceful opening.
Black's D7 is intending to build a big moyo on the bottom. But it is maybe a bit small ; as a similar move you could play A instead.]
;W[ck]C[[A\]
This shows why D9 would have been better.
With  this move White secures quite a bunch of points on the side and also limits the influence D7 was tryingto build.]
;B[pj]C[[A\]
Nice. This is coherent with the previous moves.];W[qg];B[qh]
LB[kc:B][rj:A][ek:C]C[[A\]
This is not good.
I guess you played this in order to secure some territory on the right side. If you want to do so, a move at S11 or S10 would probably be better. There is one thing important to know : a contact play is a defensive move. It is not a good offensive move since your opponent might use it to consolid its stones.

Personally I would consider A, B or something around C instead of the played stone.]
;W[jd]C[[A\]
Very nice from White who ignored your contact play and achieves a beautiful moyo with K16.]
;B[rg]LB[jj:A][fk:B]C[[A\]
Too early. This will give you a few points on the side, but I believe a move around A or around B would be very big.
In a moyo game, the biggest moves are often on the border between the two areas of influence.]
;W[qf];B[rf]C[[A\]
Small... See previous comment.];W[re];B[rh]C[[A\]
Not needed for the moment.
Here, taking the initiative to play in the center or invade would have been very important]
;W[ph];B[pi]C[[A\]
Not needed either.
Playing this way just helps White build his framework on the top.]
;W[oh]
(;B[oi]TR[pi][pj]C[[A\]
Very submissive.
One other thing you might want to keep in mind :
During opening and middle game, empty triangles are almost always bad (it is a bad shape).

Now Q10 has become a useless stone.];W[bm];B[bn];W[cm];B[cn]
;W[dl];B[em];W[el];B[fl];W[fk];B[fn]LB[gk:B][gl:A]C[should I have waited until later to do this move

[A\]
I think you need to answer F9 or your wall would be too weak.
But A would be better than the played stone.
I think B would be posible too, but it might lead to a fierce battle if White cuts.]
;W[gl]C[[A\]
That's why H8 would have been better than F5.];B[gm];W[hl];B[hm]

[ic:E][kc:F][mc:G][cd:A][pq:H]C[[A\]
It is easy to see here that White was able to build a bigger framework. (~40 pts bigger).
But there is more room for invasion in White's moyo.

A to G are possible spots where to start an invasion.
White can only invade around H.

But White is ahead anyway.];B[nn]C[[A\]
Not needed.
Black doesn't have much to fear at this cut point.
You should definitely use the initiative to invade White !
I W plays E17 next, he will probably win the game.];W[fm];B[en]
C[[A\]
From now on, Black and White are playing yose (endgame) moves... but there's still room to invade !]

Not needed...];B[se];W[sd];B[sf];W[an];B[ao];W[am];B[bo];W[cc]

Nice ! (although better at E17)
White should have played it before A6 or K8.];B[pg]C[[A\]

This move is ok, even if after the hane at A you won't be left with much territory.]

Both Black and White played a nice sequence so far.]

You wanted too much here.
A is the only move. (possibly preceded by a J16-K15 exchange)

Indeed, I think White shouldn't live here.]
(;B[br]LB[dq:A]C[[A\]
I think this move is a mistake.
You should simply descend to A instead shutting White into the corner.
You can check all the variations I've included. I can't find a way for White to live after D3. Maybe he can get a ko ? Try it out !]

Should still be at D3 in my opinion.];W[cr];B[aq];W[bs]

Without the lower left mistake, the game would have been even. But White shouldn't have let you live in the center. 
Anyway your two invasions show that you have nice fighting skills !

Some advice I could give you :

- take more into consideration the global position on the board. Sometimes just take some time to look at the board and ask yourself : where are my weaknesses ? where are my opponent's weaknesses ? Where are the biggest points on the board ? And try to elaborate a strategy. Which implies : don't play too fast games ! I think you'll improve much more by playing a slow and collected game and reviewing it than by plying 3 fast games.

- don't follow your opponent everywhere on the board. Taking and keeping the initiative is extremely important ! Often the big points on the board are the same for you and your opponent. If you let him the initiative, he will take them all and get a big lead.

- observe many dan/pro games. Don't try to understand every move or to study it in details, but just try to feel the pace, the style, to observe and 'feel' the whole board, the overall playing direction... Even if you won't notice it at first, this will learn you a lot !]
