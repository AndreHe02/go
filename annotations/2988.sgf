C[Hi! My name is Jan, I'm a 13 kyu on KGS and I'm going to review your game. My comments will be marked with "J:".]
;B[cd]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: Hello
djeezas [22k\]: hello!];W[pp]C[djeezas [22k\]: happy new year
djeezas [22k\]: !
Chaghatai [21k\]: you too];B[pc];W[cp];B[fc];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe]
;B[pd]C[J: Black deserves a slap in the face for that move!]
;W[ph]TR[pi]C[J: This is a mistake you made several times throughout the game: You are too modest. The ideal extension from two stones is at the triangle. Sometimes it's necessary to play tight, but here there is no reason to. 

Try to play on a grand scale in the opening!];B[eq];W[gq];B[fp]
C[J: The usual continuation would be E5.];W[gp];B[fo];W[cm]
;B[dp]
(;W[do]TR[co]C[J: I don't like this move because of the possible followups for black (see variations). Best to play at C5 or C3, depending on your preferences.

I'm not too sure about my C3 variation, though, and I like the result of C5 better.]

(;B[cq];W[bp];B[eo];W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[jp]
TR[kp]SQ[fk]C[J: It's difficult to say whether white should cap black at the quadrangle. I guess I would agree with you and make a base at the bottom. However, the ideal extension is, once again, at the triangle.]
;B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[io];B[in];W[jn];B[ek];W[dk]
(;B[cg];W[di]C[J: In this case, I would have prefered to atari and try to move out into the center.]
;B[ej];W[dj];B[ei];W[jm]TR[jl]SQ[pl]C[J: Jump whenever possible! It's the only way for fast developing your stones. In this case, K8 is far superior to your overly secure (and slow) play.

However, I would go for the quadrangle. The reason is that black is already strong in the center and it's hard for you (and in general) to make territory there. On the other hand, black's moyo will be far from secure even if he continues developing there, so you should have ample opportunity for invasion.]
;B[im];W[il]TR[jk]C[This move doesn't really threaten anything, and you were lucky that black actually responds in the next move. Again, a jump is the superior choice.]
;B[gm]
(;W[kl]TR[jk]SQ[jj]C[J: Try to keep up the pressure! I marked two (local) alternatives. Of course, black can try to peep and run out into the moyo your stacking out, but it's fairly open this way, too.

Look at the alternatives. I played out the quadrangle one for you so you can take a first look on that kind of connection.]
;B[hl];W[ik]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: I like how it's going here]
;B[hk];W[pl]C[J: Huge.];B[mc];W[me];B[le];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf]
;B[jf];W[nd]C[J: No, no, no! Keep up with black! Thanks to this move you lost the chance to keep black pushed low.

This is a major mistake...];B[md];W[nf];B[ij];W[jj]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: from here, move 61, the sequence is forced as I see it]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[jh];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[jg];W[li];B[qq]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: all the way to this huge move for black

J: Yes, this is a big move. However, if you play correctly, you can still win. Black will come out in front by meager 7.5 points (see the variation). As you can see: nothing is decided yet!

Also, look at the variation for reference on how to play out the invasion.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr]
(;W[mr]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: I do not like how it's going here

J: Playing this way is dangerous, even if you don't make a mistake like the one you did. See variation!]

(;B[mq]
(;W[lq]TR[lr]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: mistake

J: Yes. How about quietly extending to M2 in this case? See variations for possible plays.]
;B[mp]
(;W[np]TR[oo]C[J: I think connecting at P5 is the superior move. See variation!]
;B[no];W[op];B[lr];W[mo];B[lp];W[kq];B[lo];W[mn];B[ln]
(;W[nn]TR[mm]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: looking bad

J: If black wants to push you forward, why not go there? See variation!]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[mm]
(;W[ml]C[J: The best thing I could come up with is W N7 and abandoning the 4 stones, linking up to your 6 white ones in the process. See variation.]
;B[nm];W[on];B[om];W[ol];B[pn];W[pm]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: oops]
;B[rp];W[oo];B[qn];W[ro];B[rq];W[rn];B[qm];W[ql];B[rm];W[rl]
;B[sn]C[Chaghatai [21k\]: At least I fell back

J: Actually, black allows you to rescue your stones! See variations.]

(;W[qo]C[J: Uh oh! Errm... no.];B[so];W[sm];B[sl];W[kr];B[ms]
;W[sk];B[sm];W[nc]TR[rj]SQ[dh]C[J: No, no, no! You have (!) to play at the triangle to prevent black from ruining your hard-earned moyo even further!

And even if you could play elsewhere, your point would be rather uninteresting. I'd go for the sente move of the quadrangle and try to reduce black's significant moyo!]
;B[mb]C[J: .. lucky you!];W[nb];B[re];W[rf];B[se];W[sf];B[rd]
;W[pb]TR[sc]C[J: Actually, black should really live in that corner. He only has to play at T17 to make two eyes, after all! 

Play elsewhere!];B[qb];W[pa];B[qa]

;B[cs];W[es];B[fq];W[gr];B[km];W[jl]C[J: Unnecessary!];B[dl]
C[Chaghatai [21k\]: I already wrote this invasion off as doomed

J: It's not as hopeless as you think. Take a look at the variations!

Giving in at C8 will rid you of the trouble, but it costs you some points. If white plays correctly, I believe black can't do anything, but it's a complicated play.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[ck];B[bl]
(;W[bk]C[J: I think this is wrong. B7 should be your choice. First, take a look at what black can do this way. Then look at the consequences of B7!]

(;B[bm];W[bn];B[co];W[cn];B[an];W[bo];B[ak];W[aj]C[J: Like this, black can't do anything.]

[pr][qr][rr][sr][as][bs][ns][os][qs][rs][ss]C[J: First things first: you were much better than the score tells you. You had very good shape in the beginning, even though I sometimes got the feeling you were more interested in good shape than in fast development. 

Therefore, the most important advice I can give you is to learn (and practice) jumps. They will help you to develop much faster in the beginning.

Secondly, please study the variations for the lower right that I suggested. They definitely aren't completely correct (at least not against single digit kyu players), but I believe they should give you an insight into your alternatives. Very important: Learn the 3-3-invasion by heart! 

If you have any questions, feel free to mail me or to contact me on KGS. I go by the name of Fukurokuju.]
