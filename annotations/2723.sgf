C[I felt I got behind early, and basically only caught up because of a mistake by my opponent. Of course I want to figure out how not to get behind early :)

sinprejic [6k?\]: hi :)
Basho [6k\]: hi, have fun

nk2k: Ok, I'm going to make 2 passes on this, editing my comments accordingly.  My summary will be at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[kp];W[qq]LB[no:A];B[qp]
;W[pq];B[op];W[rq]C[To this point I can find pro games on gobase.org that play this way. W wins the one game and thus it seems I have not yet made any terrible moves.]

(;B[oq]C[This is not found in pro play (at gobase.org). I also generally know that it is not the best idea since p3 sometimes is valuable as a liberty for black later, and it forces w into a more stable shape, but how do I punish it? Play undercutting at s5 or t6 is big endgame so It seems I must first block.

nk:  this is overplay. view the variation, it is something important to learn about 5k~ish, showing you what is wrong with a common mistake around that level and above..]
;W[or];B[rp]C[black has played what I think is an endgame move. it seems I should benefit here, but what I played seemed insufficient]

(;W[np]LB[dj:A]C[this looks like overplay to me.  sanrensei on your side looks juicy.  view the variation.  

B might want to play to stop your sanrensei right now.  view the other variation.]

(;B[nr];W[mr];B[no];W[lp]C[weak move, lets b play this sequence (though b does it sloppy..)]
;B[lo];W[mo];B[mq]C[wrong order btw...b could have secured the right side well in this sequence]
;W[ns];B[mn];W[mp];B[ln];W[dj]LB[nn:A]C[i'd be aiming at b's weakness right now.  great cutting point.]

(;B[kq]LB[jd:B][mq:A]C[this seemed odd, though it did later allow one of his groups to live. I suppose I should have tenukied.

nk:  yep.  you let b get away with this for free..  if ever in doubt, count points, and take it slow.  
1 point in sente if black takes A
insane hugeness and power at B]
(;W[lq];B[fc]C[now I feel like I am behind. I was happy for the oportunity to pincer black's stone, ( f17 at k17 seems more natural to me for black).]

(;W[id]LB[ko:A]C[At this point given the black thickness below and star points I felt I had to play for influence

nk: so..why didn't you play the hoshi pincer?  it goes well with your sanrensei.

the cutting point here is also huge...view the variation a move back.]
;B[kc];W[gd]C[I made this "joseki" up on the spot. It probably has holes in it, but I wanted to be sure to get influence out of this no matter what.

nk: how i'd play against this is a variation]
(;B[gb]C[way too low, you get your wish ;)];W[fd];B[dc];W[cc]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[ce];B[cb]C[I felt fairly hapy with this

nk: especially getting it in sente...b is robbed here.];W[qc]
LB[qf:A][ko:B]C[now some territory to balence things out in sente. and try to slide along the top and bottom of the black stones that will be in the p16 to m17 area

nk:  this is so wrong..A is much better.

you allow b to get the entire right side with this play.  you can also do the B cut now.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[nb]
;B[mc];W[ke];B[bc]C[I strongly considered tenuki but in the end it seemed like I was giving away too much if I tenukied.

nk:  it is always bad to tenuki if you have to answer the follow up.]

(;W[cd];B[kg];W[jf]C[this caused black to think a long time.]
;B[jh];W[mf]C[(this would have been better for b to play this) B needs to invade you right away now..and you are cuttable as in the variation.  from some people my level, this would be an instant response to do the variation.]

(;B[mg];W[ne];B[lf];W[le]
(;B[hc]LB[od:A][mg:B]C[This seemed like a bit of a gift from black. see variation

(;W[ig];B[hi];W[gq]LB[ig:A][hi:C][ko:B]C[eh??  if you are going to play a move like a, you'd better aim for the cut next.  the cut at B seems better than the extension, though it should have been played earlier..the ladder works after c was played.  so, the move is correct, though too late.  look at the hugeness of b's right side!  it can be directly blamed on the corner invasion.]

you are going for a unlikely kill shot that damages your corner territory.  bad play.]

;B[ff];W[kh]LB[hp:A]C[Black Resigns here

sinprejic [5k?\]: thankyou
Basho [6k\]: thank you

nk: B's right side is absolutely huge, and this is because of your corner invasion.  Whenever I lose a game like this, I curse at myself because I could have won the game very easily.  killing is almost never a reasonable goal, and you almost always get bitten for it.  And you never realized you could capture the A group?  be careful...ok, time for second pass.

second pass notes:  lots of useful things added, thogh my opinion on the game didn't change.]
