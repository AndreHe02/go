RE[W+26.5]

C[DRS: "LungChing" has submitted this game for review by the GTL. My comments and questions are prefixed by "DRS".

Here are some comments as requested. Remember, only a high dan level pro player knows the truth about go; other opinions such as my own are only useful to stimulate discussion.

- John Stephenson July 8, 2002.];B[po]C[Q5: rarely used anymore.]
;W[dp];B[pc]C[I wonder how Q17 is consistent with Q5? Lets see what will happen.]
;W[dd];B[jd]C[K16: too early and too small.   The biggest area is the bottom, not the top at this moment. Should be Q3. Then the opening is back to normal.

Or, black may try Q11, an unusual form of the Chinese Fuseki style.]
;W[qi]C[DRS: What would you do here?  I was hoping for a kakari on the UR or LR.

R11: Since black did K16, W's splitting move is doable IMHO.

W can also R15 (and I would do R15 immediately.) because then the K16 stone will turn out not so usefully placed.   If you do not like white's R11, why play K16?

I believe white is already ahead.]
(;B[qe];W[ql]C[Q5 is just not well positioned now. (If you could move it, you would move it to P3.)]
;B[rn]C[S6: of course you feel uncomfortable about Q5 being opened. But a 2nd line move early is slow.]
;W[jq]C[K3: This may be a little slack. Black threatens to make a bigger than normal lower right. It's good timing for white to play Q3 on the door line.]
;B[oq]C[DRS: How is this?  Too many stones or what?  How many points of territory should I hope for, when using three stones like this?

In general figure 5 pts / stone. But somehow black is not particularly happy since there is less than normal outside value of the 3 stone enclosure.]
;W[hc]C[DRS: What to do when W undercuts the high stone at K16?

In general a stone on the 4th line means you want to build a moyo or start a big fight.   You may always be "opened" with a 3rd line approach. So, if cash is more important than moyo, do 3rd line move, not a 4th line. K16 was not a good shape in conjuction with Q17 early on. It is not easy to see a moyo game anymore. White has sucessfully punished the black K16 move.]
;B[ic]C[J17: this is bad. It really helps white a lot in the left corner, while black's top is still invadable. Instead of J17, the biggest area move is the left side.   Black can play either C10 or C6. C6 is probably what I would do since white cannot easily pincer. White cannot easily pincer because white should use the K3 stone to build cash. (If K3 was K4, then white could easily pincer).]
;W[hd]C[DRS: I'm unhappy with this exchange, but I didn't really know what else to do.  I'm displeased because I didn't get solidified that much, but W has an ideal extension now.  What's better locally? What's better globally?

White is much better locally. You have two weak stones I think you must continue on top since you did J17. It's a bit dangerous to leave a weak heavy group there.]
;B[dj]C[D10: this 4th line move looks like you are either building a moyo (impossible in the w zone) or reducing something. The left is so wide open you should not be thinking you are reducing. No reason not to play 3rd line to make a base in the open left side zone.]
;W[cl]TR[jd][ic]C[C8: C6 may work better for white. In general, when approaching a light stone like D10, be soft.

Also, white played a non-urgent approach move. Since black did a tenuki after creating two weak looking stones, white may have tried to find some way to punish them immediately. Perhaps white couldn't find it yet.]
;B[cq]C[DRS: Long-long demands a 3-3 invasion?

C3 is almost good timing since white has two 3rd line wings. However, since white cannot secure the lower left in one move, it could also be slightly early.   In genral, perfect timing is doing things at the last possible moment. It is easy for me to state that guideline but often hard to apply it.

Long-long if off 4-4 and wings are high does not demand 3-3 early, since the wing position will become an effective moyo.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq]TR[cl]
C[DRS: Am I correct in thinking I can afford to tenuki here?

Yes you can tenuki, though B6 seems like sente to me. The marked w stone is not very efficient after the invasion. So black gained something here.]
;B[md]TR[jd][ic]C[N16: its urgent to helpl your weaker stones, but N16 should be M16, closer to weak stones and farther from stronger corner stones.]
;W[ch]C[C12: this is slack. White needs to C15 and finish his nice upper left! It still pressures the D10 stone; in fact, even better since the scale is bigger.]
;B[cc]C[C17: really urgent. very good move. Excellent timing.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[fj]SQ[hj]
[bn][gg][io][ip]C[DRS: W's moyo is looking big, and I don't know what to do about it, or even how I could have prevented it.  Any suggestions in how to deal with it now, and how to keep it from arising previously, are welcome.

Don't be jealous. Count the game. Black is doing well in the cash department:

Black is UL: 8, U:9, UR: 12, LR: 16, LL: 7 total 52

White is R: 4, Komi 5.5 total 9.5 so white needs 43 points on the left. It's not so easy to see this many since white has open doors. I have marked some possible reduction points, but if you reduce white to 40 points of cash and also get some center facing stones, you may win without troubles. This shows how slack white's C12 really was.]
;B[bf];W[ce];B[ae];W[bg];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[af];W[ad]
;B[ac];W[ag];B[ad];W[ee]C[You reduced w a bit in sente, so far so good.]
;B[fb]C[F18: white may not answer this move, so it's too early. Also, when w answers it, it also damages the top right.]
;W[gb];B[jg]C[K13: pretty gentle, if N16 were M16 you would have more uuumph, eh?]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[hh];B[ph]C[Q12: time to build? I think continue to reduce with J4 is better? You'd like to have white to have under 40; seem doable without getting into danger.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[oj]C[White got strong on right which makes reducing more difficult on left.]
;B[ni];W[ki];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[li];B[mi];W[ii]C[So, black made some cash but so did white.]
;B[kp]C[L4: this move seems to say its ok for black to build and white to build; but white to build is bigger. Therefore a better way for black is for both to destroy each other's zones. L5 or perhaps K7 on the doorline is possible here? If K7 is too dangerous, then L7? Black must think reduction not construction at this moment.]
;W[jp];B[ko];W[in];B[lj];W[jh];B[kj];W[ig];B[jk];W[hl];B[nl]
C[O8: hmm, black has neglected defense due to M13 cut point?]
;W[qg];B[kq]C[L3: a big move, but R14 is big also and seems to be sente against the w group on the right.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[pe]C[Q15: did you play in your own territory?]
;W[sd];B[rc];W[ib];B[jb]C[K18: b is still thin...];W[jf];B[kf]
C[L14: m14 or m13 better for defense?];W[lg];B[mh];W[ke];B[lf]
;W[le];B[mf];W[je]C[Black shape is crashed.];B[ld];W[me];B[ne]

C[K17: White should continue with L1; it's double sente.];B[js]
;W[is];B[ks];W[ir];B[kc];W[an];B[ap];W[jc];B[jo];W[io];B[kc]
;W[rm];B[ka]C[DRS: Bigger?

Perhaps, but white gained someting nice from his upper attack in sente. White is therefore satisfied.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[qn];B[qo];W[sn];B[qq]TR[ks][kr][kq][kp][ko]C[I guess black is behind by more than 10 now.  Seems to me that black is strong enough to play R3 at T4 unless you are sure white can somehow invade your corner.]
;W[km];B[kn]C[L6: this is ugly. Take H9 sente first?];W[jm]
;B[lm];W[sc];B[sb];W[se];B[qf]C[DRS: Big mistake?

It's too much.];W[rb]C[If you are desparate and have really great ko threats you can challenge with s19; but, yes, R14 is a blunder it seems.]

;B[jc];W[om];B[sb];W[rg];B[nm];W[kk];B[jj];W[ik];B[ij];W[hj]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[nj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[ar]C[DRS: Necessary defense?

Yes.];W[ia];B[ea];W[ga];B[ba]C[DRS: I now think this was probably unnecessary.  What do you think?  Without this stone, it seems that the best W can do is get a ko of sorts - but it seems to be a ko over nothing.  Or W could get a seki if B plays badly.  True?

B19 is not required. If white plays a stone at b19, then black does B18. It is one eye fighting no eye, so black wins. If white next A18 it is not ko. White can never connect nor approach. Black can remove all ko threats and then capture ko. So white is dead inside. White is dead without condition.]

[si][sj][sk][sl][sm]C[I suggest you bone up on reducing and invading.  Here are some general guidelines:

Opponent zone less than 20 points, reduce it.
Opponent zone 20 or more and open to center, can invade it.
Opponent zone 30 or more can invade it.

When invading you want 3rd line entry nearer to relatively weaker opponent side, then play as many inside forcing moves as possible, and end with a fast gote move to live quick.

Good luck!])
