C[Hi Paul,

      I'm glad to review your game, this is the second time i review players' game.

      If you have any question you still don't understand,you can continue to write to me,but you must be prepared to wait for my reply, normally i check my mail twice a week. If you have some personal questions on learing go or when having a game of go,please don't hesitate to write to me, i will always available for everyone who wants to
discuss go with me. 밑밀

no serious mistakes untill now.];W[gc]CR[dj]C[This invasion ends up causing me some problems in the end I think.  Was there a better way to deal with it?

xinhai:
white invasion here seems unreasonable for me. but he can do this too, because he has the marked stone to support his invasion.]

maybe you can try E18 and wait for white response to decide your next move.]

yes, really! 밐밀];B[df];W[eg];B[ef]C[xinhai:
even if white move here,you won't die easily,so your 41 move can move at other places now,e.g. aroud K3 and Q10,you should use you the thickness build by your H16 group to attack white groups, this is general go knowledge.]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[jp]C[xinhai:
white is expanding];B[qh]CR[qk]C[xinhai:
not really good, white can invade around R9. But it's nice too,bacause you can make use of your thick group at thr upper side to attack white.

xinhai:
what i think is, white 78 move ia aimed at attacking and reducing balck's moyo on the upper side. you should play around L13. but this let white to strengthen his moyo and territory.

xinhai:
If you look carefully, white was not dead because black still have weakness that can let white break in, they are marked with alphebet. If white play at c , your black group die. I agree you get more than white with the exchange.]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[hl];B[hq];W[go]C[xinhai:

yes, wasted move,if white plat at 163, black won't dead, white is just throwing himself into the trap. See variation.]

xinhai:
if you don't play wasted move like 163, then you have secured them, therfore, white has the chance to "irritates" you. 밐밀

If in the condition like this ( you already play 163 ) , then i think you can move a, if white b, you c , and so on, you lost less. if you a, white response at d, you can move b, if white next move is f,you can play c. There's many solution and you can figure it out if you look more carefully, but which is better depend on personal favourite and surrounding condition.]

black: 63 + 30 + 0 = 93
white: 58 + 36 + .5 = 94.5

white won by 1.5 stones

xinhai:
white had made several mistakes during the game that make him win over you slightly. Both of you should play more, it helps you to improve.

what i want to say is, try to restudy this game ,you will learn more each ti =me you review your game.

Both of you are too territory concentrated, what i mean is you two are too concentrated on territory, we can't deny that territory is important, but skill is more important, if you don't have enough skill, you can't fight and always under attacks, this is worst. Try to mend this habit,ok?

I have some suggestion for you:
1. Try to do more live and dead question, it helps you to develop your calculate ability and feeling. Feeling here means sense that made you move at the right place.
2. If can, learn more from books and teachers. Study each example in books carefully and try to use them in your game. Teacher can help you a lot, you can learn from him and have chances to ask him questions, seek advice from him, and etc.
3. Study high dan player reviews, especially professional players' reviews. By studying them carefully, you know why they move here, what's the idea or motives behing these moves......
You will know more clearly about their way of thought.

Finally, plays more,it's vital for your improvement.   If you have any question, don't hesitate to write e-mail to me, i'll try my best to help you. ; )

;W[sj];B[oq];W[nr];B[or]C[this protect your corner, but white get a big territory on the upper right side.

xinhai:
allow me to make a small conclusion here for what i think about this game.
you should learn to give up some stones to fulfill your motives. sometimes,give up a little doesn't mean you lost a lot,but to gain a lot too at the other places. To give up stones, maybe it's painful to some beginner,but you shuold try to tackle it. don't be afraid to ko and giving up stones. To tackle this, you need a good calculating capability. To train yourself on these, try to do more live and death questions, they help you a lot.

Besides, opening moves are important too. Someone thinks that,since we are not professional players, we can move where ever we like,i don't quite agree with that, opening moves would affect the whole game too. Go is not as simple as you think,but win or lose does not depends very much on opening moves. Go is formed by many aspects,e.g. opening, middle board fighting,and etc.
every moves is related to each other.
therfore, think carefully on each move is vital. I would make conclusions at the moves following up.]
