(;B[lq]C[This is my usual response to the O3 stone... Is there other good alternatives?

A couple. These're the two I know of];W[jq];B[np];W[op];B[oo]
;W[mp]C[This looks like a mistake, is that true, i never seen anyone playing that...?

Its a major mistake by white as far as I see it. You get a monstrous shape, great thickness, and you have a tentaive hold on the whole right side, plus you can use your shape to warap around him, and white takes only the third line]
;B[oq];W[mq];B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[kn];W[jo]
(;B[jj]C[I always try to play a stone in the center.

Bad move. Tengens great if your used the playing for the center, but the games not far enough along to worry about it. Any of these other spots require more immediate attention, especially the lower left. While white made a major mistake with N4, if you let him hold the bottom left without so much as a fight, the game will be very hard for you later]
;W[ln];B[km]C[Good response, given the situation];W[qq];B[qp]
;W[mn];B[no];W[pk]
(;B[ok]C[I wouldn't have gone with this given how far you are from the edge, but it is a good idea, as white has to try to make life now]

;W[nh];B[og];W[ng];B[of];W[qh];B[qj]C[good move. usually you'd play at R14 or 15 to take away his eye space, but this saves your shape]
;W[qe]C[White looks like he has a solid base...]
(;B[qd]C[But because of your Q10 and O13 groups, its still weak enough to kill, or at least drastically shrink. See variations. S12 looks like the best spot to attack. R16 works as well, but its very defensive, consider how many strong stones you have to support you already]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[nc];W[rd];B[ob];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[rb]C[I felt i won the fight... white has almost no territory and some weakness...

Yes, but you have to exploit those weaknesses quickly, before he fills them in]
;B[nj]C[smart attacking point, he can't play O11 with risking losing that small patch of territory around N7]
;W[mj];B[ni];W[mi];B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[ll];B[nm];W[lm];B[lj]
C[good cutting point];W[jl]C[Strange game whites playing. His stones are holding together, but by a fairly thin thread.]
;B[il];W[jm];B[im];W[ik];B[in];W[jn];B[jk];W[hk]
(;B[do]C[Good time to start a new attack. If white got anymore stones over here for defense, attacking would've become that much more difficult. Although I'm very paranoid about the N10 and O12 groups, so before your attack, you might want to make sure they're dead so they can't come back and haunt you]
;W[gm]C[good defense by white as well. One or two stones away from a cranes nest]

(;B[ep]C[small expansion. I'd go with C3 myself here, to try and get the left edge]
;W[eq];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[fp];W[em];B[fq];W[cm]C[Hes boxed you in, so now you have to go to C3]

;B[fk];W[ej];B[fg]C[terrible, awful move. This is far to easy to cut and is too far away from any support to stay alive if it is cut.]
;W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[fj];W[ei];B[hf]C[nice save, but it was too dpenedent on your opponent]

(;B[ee]C[too small a threat, and too easily blocked off];W[de]
;B[dk]C[Is this invasion acceptable, is it normal to make here a living group?

yes, you have enough threats and enough space that you should have time to make a living group]

;W[hp];B[io];W[ip]
(;B[gp]C[not necessary. if your worried about your stones, just link them after using a snapback. Then I'd cut under white, to take away a little of his territory]
;W[en];B[gl];W[bq];B[br];W[af]
(;B[bh]C[Not necessary. This is pure gote. There are other sente spots that are worth a lot more, especially P-O2]
;W[or]C[and because white still has sente, he can lead you around the board and fill in the gaps in his defense]

(;B[pq]C[one spot too high. I do not believe white can beat Q2]

(;B[cb]C[one spot too far. C19 would work for a monkey jump. Here he can cut you off]
;W[db];B[bc];W[da]
(;B[hl]C[sente, but still very small. These're better. A couple, like T2 and T11 are also small, but M18/19 is almost 10 moku, and H3 is even more. J2 is a lot more risky, but worth more]

Good game black. Only thing I really must stress in once you have sente, think for a long time before you move, because you need to hold sente as long as you can. Had the game been closer going into yose, white could've edged ahead of you]
