C[Olaf Martens (OM): Hi. This is my game from round 5 of the Mindunai Cup 2001 (I played White). I chose this game for reviewing because it shows some of my typical weaknesses: middle game fighting and positional judgement.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[qd];B[od];W[oc];B[nc];W[pc];B[md];W[qf]
;B[ic]C[JH : For Black, to have to play on the 3rd line is a bit flat. I would prefer to play the solid connexion and on the fourth line but it is rather a question of personal style.]
;W[fq]LB[cf:a]C[OM: I think an approach move against the marked black stone would have been better here. Would 'A' be the right spot?
JH : I agree. It may be a good way to avoid that Black build a big moyo. Anyway, White move is not bad.]
;B[dn];W[jp];B[ci]C[JH : looks good];W[gn]LB[de:a][ei:b]C[OM: This is a guess move. Maybe Q6/R6 would be better here. But I wanted to go into the center and at the same time defend against an invasion around H3.
JH : Probably dubious. White should erase Black moyo at "a" or "b". Because you went for territory in the upper right corner, it is difficult for white to go on with a moyo strategy.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[ql]C[JH : May be protecting the corner in sente and erasing Black moyo is slightyt better.]
;B[qq]LB[pl:a]C[JH : To prevent White bi moyo, Black should attach at "a"]
;W[pn]C[OM: I was a bit nervous here. ;)];B[qm]LB[qo:a]C[Normally, Black plays at "a" but still possible.]
;W[qo]C[JH : seems good];B[ro]LB[pm:a]TR[ql]C[OM: The lower right went according to my plans. But what to do now? A move at 'A' seems necessary now (building a huge moyo). But I was afraid that Black could build his own moyo at the top with a move around K10.
JH: It is too late to be afraid. The move at "a" is too good for both players. This is the first big mistake in the game.
By playing "a", you expand your moyo and prevent black from hurting your "delta" stone.]
;W[ck]C[OM: I didn't know if this invasion was the right thing to do. I played there because I hoped Black's response to this move would give me some clue what to do next...
JH: this move is not so good as it may help Black to build the upper left, which is the biggest place.]
;B[ei]LB[pm:a]C[JH : localy good but "a" is so big];W[dr]C[JH : White should move his invading stone]
;B[cq]LB[dl:a]C[JH : not bad but "a" may be better];W[fl]LB[pm:a]
C[OM: Ahhh... much better now. Black has to answer this move. Otherwise his corner group is in danger. And I give up the marked stone and then play at 'A' to get a huge moyo...
JH: No. Black can play tenuki on the left and play "a".];B[pm]
C[OM: Uhhhh. :( Black doesn't do what I want.];W[on]LB[cm:a]
C[White should not answer but try some sente move on the lower right group like "a"]
;B[qi];W[om];B[ol];W[nl]C[OM: Moyo, moyo, moyo!];B[nk];W[ok]
;B[pl];W[oj]LB[mk:a][ml:b]C[OM: Right move at 'A'? I thought that giving up the right side so easily would be too much good for Black.
JH : White seems a bit greedy. The regular move is "b"];B[mk]
;W[ml];B[mi];W[lk]C[JH Not so good as white 2 stones on the right will be almost dead after black play the bamboo joint.]
;B[ni];W[rh];B[hk]C[OM: Another mystery. Why didn't Black answer S12?
JH : Answering at S11 is good enough for Black];W[lj]C[JH : this move is strange too]
;B[li];W[ki];B[ii];W[kh];B[oi];W[de]LB[il:a]C[OM: I knew that a move at 'A' was very urgent. But I was afraid that if I let Black play e.g. C15 I would fall behind.

JH : 'A' is not so big. White move is OK];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb]
;W[cd];B[eb];W[bg]C[Strange move. Playing on the third line is good enough.]
;B[dg]C[JH : Very bad. Black lets white connect on the second line and get life]
;W[cg]LB[bi:a]C[White should play at "a"];B[im]LB[ch:a]C[Should play at "a" to keep white separated and get stronger]
;W[ke]C[May be white will like to invade the upper side if he can reinforce the left side first. So This move doesn't do a lot for white]
;B[jd]LB[lc:a]C[JH: not good at black has still the defect at "a"]
;W[jl];B[jj];W[kj];B[il];W[gj]LB[io:a]C[OM: I think 'A' is better here. It defends against further reduction and links up to the marked stones. Maybe G10 was the losing move.
JH : This move seems too much.];B[gh]LB[fk:a]C[For Black, the tsukekoshi at "a" seems stronger.]
;W[kd]LB[lc:a]C[Bad move : the vital point is at "a"];B[kc]
;W[hi]TR[ck]C[JH : White is trying too much here. White should reinforce the delta stone.]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[hj];W[gi]LB[io:a][fj:b]TR[gj]C[OM: The reason I played all this was that I hoped I could kill Black's center group. I thought that otherwise I would be too much behind. But simply playing at 'A' would maybe enough to win the game? (Total failure in positional judgement)
JH : White fighting was not so good in the middle. May be you should have played at "b" first instead of delta.]
;B[gk];W[fj];B[fk];W[ej];B[ek];W[dj];B[cl];W[di];B[bk];W[bj]
;B[ig];W[jh];B[jm];W[ll]LB[kn:a]C[This move is too shy. Why not play "a"]
;B[ip]C[Now that Black can play here, white is not well in the game]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[hp];B[io];W[jq];B[gp];W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fp]
C[OM: Huge loss for White.];W[ri];B[rj]LB[qj:a]C[May be a bit dangerous : Black can draw back at "a"]
;W[qj];B[qk]LB[pj:a]C[Big mistake : Why not capturing the 2 white stones at "a" : it is sente]
;W[pj];B[rl];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[ng]C[Big recovery for white in sente]
;W[ne]C[OM: Desperately trying to kill another group.];B[me]
;W[oe];B[nd];W[pe];B[lf];W[kf]LB[hg:a][bl:b]C[This move is not sente so White should have try the cut at "a" or at "b"]
;B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[nn];B[lo];W[mp];B[lp];W[lq];B[pr];W[or]
;B[bl]C[JH : very big];W[hg]C[OM: Now I'm really behind. The capture of the two marked white stones gave Black too many points. The rest of the game is just desperately catching small fish.]
;B[fg];W[hf];B[ge];W[cr];B[bb];W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[ee];W[df]
;B[br];W[dq];B[cp];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[km];W[lc]C[OM: White is desperately trying to get the big kill.

JH : This move doesn't seem to work.];B[ld];W[kb];B[jc];W[mb]
;B[nb];W[ed];B[ec]C[Black should simply connect];W[fh];B[dd]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[hd]C[JH : I dont understand why white plays moves that doesn't work]
;B[he]C[OM: Here ends the game record. Although we played the game out till the end because both sides wished to do so. At the end, White lost by about 30 pts.]
