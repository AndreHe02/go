C[I am 11k and this was an even game i won against a solid 9k. It was a much better game than i usually play, i applied some new concepts i learned from studying Shusaku games etc.

I would like to receive some comments as to direction of play, parts of the game (opening, middle, yose), techniques (fighting, defending) and anything else you see

I put my own comments on moves, please comment on my comments :)

Comment: Andre Bergholz (2K, marked with AB)];B[qd]C[Also, please estimate my true strength as i will be entering an tournament in spring and i don't think i am 11k player (stronger :)

I understand that you may be unable to estimate my rank accurately, but just try to expess your opinion about something like this

Opening - 6k
Middle game - 10k
Yose - 12k];W[dc];B[oc];W[qj]C[Strange move by W, but who am i to judge

AB: Yes, a little strange. Occupying an empty corner would be normal.]
;B[dq];W[pq]
(;B[qo]LB[jq:A][co:B][ce:C]TR[qj]C[this move is not to allow W to get the corner

AB: This is a mistake. Of course, preventing a shimari is good per se, but this move is not urgent and leads to a fight that is favorable for White (as Black is outnumbered 2:1). The marked stone R10 is in the secondary direction of development for the shimari, so even if White encloses the corner his overall position is low. Thus, a play in the primary direction 'A' is more interesting (also making miai of 'B' and Q5). You can also play 'B' directly, but then White 'A' may bother you. 'C' is an alternative if you want to tenuki.]

(;W[qm]TR[qj]C[W may have lost the corner, but it has good side

AB: I'm a little uncertain about this move. The development in the variation seems more natural to me. White gets the corner plus a position in front of Black's shimari, while Black is safe but a little overconcentrated.]
;B[oo]
(;W[nq]C[AB: I agree with you that O4 may be a little better, N3 is worse, though.]
;B[mo]
(;W[lp]C[this is inviting attack i started with my next move

AB: Finally White attacks more severly, though one move too late as we saw before. There are not so many possibilities for you to attack here.]

(;B[jq]TR[dq]C[B is hoping to make marked stones work OR attack W to undermine the base it has made

AB: Ok, this is a forcing move (hard for me to say whether it's good). White has to respond but will be completely save afterwards.]
;W[kq]TR[lp][nq][pq]C[I got what i wanted - W defended, and W shape is pretty strong, meanwhile B K3 looks lonely

W has a local advantage there

AB: I would prefer M3 for White here (more solid).];B[gq]TR[jq]
[kq]C[B needs to secure what he has first

AB: This is not good. Black secures territory between D3 and G3, but that is small. Look at it in a different light. Imagine the exchange of the marked stones is not there. After White M4 would you have played G3? Of course not. On top of that, the exchange of the marked stones is good for White as White gets security for his group and Black gets virtually nothing (White can easily get more by playing K2 or K4).]
;W[jp]TR[mo][oo][qo]C[good move by W, but it's small, so i ignored it. If W wants that stone so bad, he can have it

AB: It's hard to evaluate the size of this move, it is not small as it increases the pressure on your group.]

(;B[pl]LB[rq:A]C[the purpose is:

a) make B bigger
b) make W live small
c) reduce possibility of attack by W

AB: Yes, you need to do something for your group. However, I would start with a simple move like S3 to give a base to your group. Territory-wise it's not small either.]

(;W[ql]LB[pm:A]C[This is exactly the responce that i wanted, but if W would respond at A, B would have some problems i think

AB: White's response is not bad. There is no reason to start a fight with an uncertain outcome for White, as he has the lead in the game.]
;B[pm]C[AB: Not so good as it makes your group heavy. It does create some eye-space, but S3 would be better. The Q8 stone must be treated lightly and not be seen as a new problem to be taken care of. A jump to O8 seems like a reasonable alternative to me.]
;W[pk]LB[qg:A]C[AB: Solid, but I wonder if a jump to R13 wouldn't be better.]
;B[qg]TR[qo][oo][mo][pl][pm]C[strong solid move by B

AB: Yes :-). But the marked group is weak.];W[ok]LB[pn:A][rp:B]
TR[pl][pm]C[P9 is a forcing move, B must reply at A to save 2 marked stones. I did not see this]
;B[de]C[This is tough for W, no matter which way it turns it will make B stronger

Please suggest a better move for W

AB: Well, first let me suggest a better move for Black :-). This is an overplay. Black cannot ignore the situation in the lower right. If White now attacks Black's base at S3 or S4, Black will be in severe trouble for the rest of the game. So S3 was necessary now. Jump out to N8 is probably possible too.]

(;W[fd]LB[cg:A]C[i think this was a mistake by my opponent

AB: What makes you think that? I think a pincer at 'A' may have been better as I believe the left side is a bit more interesting than the top, but that's not much of an issue even at my level :-). White's move is definitely not bad. An alternative is to ignore Black's move and attack in the lower right.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cg]TR[cc][cd][de]C[W's shape is not perfect either, because of F16 stone

AB: White followed the joseki, but Black did not. You can extend further down (C11, C12 if you're afraid :-)).]
;W[co]
(;B[cl]TR[cg]C[With C8 i was hoping to provide additional support between 2 marked stones and (depending on W's reply) support the corner.

Overall while the thinking may be ok, i now think C8 was a big mistake, see var with my toughts

AB: Yes, protecting the corner is more interesting here.];W[bq]

(;B[jc]C[I chose to ignore B3 for now, as i felt that K17 move is much bigger and additional var shows is not tolerable for B

AB: Doubtful choice. I think I prefer the variation for Black.]

(;W[ld]LB[cr:A]C[AB: Panic reaction. Just 'A' and the tables on the lower side are reversed. Then the Black group is all of a sudden weak and tiny (see variation).]

(;B[gc]C[i think this was a good choice not protecting at M17 that leaves N17 cuttable

AB: Yes.];W[fc];B[je]TR[ld]C[With this move i launched my attack against marked stone

I think in this position B was a clear leader in the game

AB: Good attack! But is Black leading? Black has almost 20 point upper right, a good 10 points on the left and hardly five on the lower side => 35 points. White has about 12 points on the bottom, about 6 points on the right, 4 points on top and maybe 2 on the left => 24 points. Ok, so Black has the lead on secure points. But Black is overall very thin. White should attack the Black group in the lower right, an easy target that will gain him 10 points and more easily. The Black group on the bottom is thin as well. And on the left, an invasion between C8 and C13 is possible once White stabilizes the corner group (that's why C2 is a very important point). Furthermore, White can treat the M16 stone flexibly. There will be more points for Black in this area, but the game is far from over.]
;W[kd]LB[oe:A]C[bad move by W - why make me solidify

AB: I agree. Makes himself heavy, too. Just jump to 'A' for example.]
;B[jd];W[lf]C[AB: Too narrow-minded and inflexible. Creates a target for attack himself.]
;B[me]C[My plan i started with this move worked.  see next moves to see how it worked out

AB: Normally, it is bad shape to peep on both sides of a bamboo.]
;W[kf];B[md]TR[oc][qd][me][qg]C[to create such structure of 5 stones was my goal. I can continue pushing W 4 stones later]
;W[lb];B[gd];W[bb]
(;B[mf]TR[oc][md][qd][me][qg]SQ[lb][kd][ld][kf][lf]C[Comparing B vs W i thought that my overall strategy should be tailored towards attacking center ASAP to insue my future lead

AB: White handled the top side very badly.];W[jf]C[Was N14 worth K14?

AB: I think so. Just jump G14 now or hane J14.];B[cj]LB[gf:B]
[if:A]C[Here i felt that C10 was a must, before A or B

AB: Ah, that's a bit greedy. 'A' is much better. Helps your group and hurts the White group. The balance of power between the two groups is very important.]
;W[eo]C[AB: C2 is better.];B[jj]LB[if:A][rq:B][eq:C]C[Again, i played this move as an big move. I think that this was a prime of B in this game

AB: Really? No, again 'A' would have been better. This move somehow looks big but achieves very little. In fact, the more I think about it I believe this move is bad. This is not the "ear-reddening"-move that solves every problem. Black now has defintely more points than White, so White must kill something to win. There are three targets: The Black group on top (not very probable), the group in the lower left (very possible), and the group at the bottom (not so unlikely, White F2 is a severe attack). So, 'A', 'B', and 'C' are pretty urgent for Black.]

(;W[pn]C[AB: Big mistake. White needs to go for the whole group, see variation for example. Since White's groups are strong, he can go all-out. Helps Black, because sacrificing two stones is a low price for stabilizing the group.]
;B[po];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[mm]TR[nn][mo][oo][po][qo]C[While W got the 2 stones, B position did not suffer much (i don't think)

AB: You're right. This result is good for Black. But it's just because White did not know how to attack.]
;W[nl];B[mh]TR[lb][kd][ld][jf][kf][lf]C[With this move i started my attack on marked W group

AB: Good. Keep in mind that the danger for the group in the lower left is not completely eliminated, though (see variation).]

(;W[hf]C[he saw it :(

AB: Of course.];B[ge];W[gf]C[AB: Not so good, as it drives the Black group to security. Just jump out.]
;B[fe]TR[gc][jc][gd][jd][ge][je]C[This move was made to avoid future complications to make my marked group alive

AB: Absolutely necessary, And say "thank you", because White forced you to play well.]
;W[ii];B[dn]TR[co][eo]C[This move it typical of my play - the goal here was to weaken marked W stones and the strengthen by center group.

I don't think it is a good move, please provide some input there

AB: The peep is unnecessary. Just C3 for example to stabilize your group and destabilize White would be better.]
;W[do]TR[dq][gq]C[by inducing W to make this move, i achieved the opposite of what i wanted  - now my marked group looks very very weak and over extended]
;B[eq]C[so i solidified

AB: Seems like a good idea.];W[en]C[and lost a chance to strengthen my center group]
;B[hn]C[i don't think this particular move was good, in the right direction perhaps, but not the best

AB: Yes, again a rather vague move that doesn't achieve much. S2 is still big.]
;W[lk]C[AB: Finally a serious attack by White, though first M6, then L8 would be even more effective.]
;B[kl]C[AB: Risky and loose. Best to make a base first (S3). It's difficult to propose a good running out move.]
;W[kk];B[jk]

;B[rr];W[ps];B[rq];W[rs];B[qn]TR[pl][pm]C[marked stones are dead but they still have some aji

AB: Well, I wouldn't call an atari aji :-).];W[om];B[rm];W[rl]
;B[sn];W[ro];B[rp];W[sr];B[sq];W[pg]LB[cr:A][gi:B]C[AB: Let's reevaluate the situation. Black has 20-25 in the upper right, 3 points on the right, 4 points on the bottom, up to 15 points on the left and maybe 2 points on the top => 45 points. White has a little more than 10 points at the bottom, 6 points on the top, 5 points on the left, a little more than 10 points on the right and maybe 3 points in the middle => 35 points. Since there is no komi, the game is won for Black, even if he makes some small mistakes in the endgame. Black can also hope to profit from an attack of the slightly unstable White group at the top, so the area on the left may easily become bigger. The endgame basically begins now. The lower left is the biggest as those two groups are a little unsettled and whoever plays first, will gain a lot in sente. So White should still play C2. Stabilizing the centre group thereby reducing Black's prospects on the left by G11 is also big. The move White played is more out of desperation and not good.]

'B' works most of the time, but again not here (you need a stone at N17 for it to work, variation 2).

[dr][ds]C[B won by 9.5 pts with 0.5 komi

AB: Well, my estimate from a long time ago was pretty good then :-). I think, overall you're pretty strong for your level, definitely 10K. Middle game may be your little weak point. You tend to leave own groups weak and go for territory. Little greedy sometimes (the early invasion move 7, moves 21 and 49). This will work well against weak fighters, but strong fighters will give you a hard time. Also, sometimes you play vague moves that look big but achieve little. Improving reading ability is always good. Don't think too much about fuseki, some general principles that you already know are good enough for the moment. Getting a grip on weak vs. string groups, which territories are safe, where are opportunities for both you and the opponent, etc. is more important.
