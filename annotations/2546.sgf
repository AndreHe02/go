C[Hi, I played this game against an opponent who took it not very seriously, and barely won...   I need advice on any major mistake I made, concerning every aspects of the game.

Thank you in advance for your help

C[White is pushing too hard.  I think Q10 might have been better for him at this point.]
;B[oc]C[This move is pretty aggressive; it will be a fight for you both, and you will both take some profit.  Your main question is one of direction.  Where do you want to end up with strength, and where do you not mind letting white take profit?

(I was wondering about this move i made. Not so sure if it was good and why.)]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[pb];B[qe];W[rd]
(;B[re]C[P17 is pretty vulnerable here, and is easily taken by white.  Letting white have that stone makes white's group there strong.  That group is facing E17 making the beginnings of a very large moyo (area of influence).  

I think cleaning up your weaknesses with P16 would have been better at this point.  See variation]
;W[od];B[pe]
(;W[rb]C[It is a bit of an odd move if he was intending to sacrifice those two stones.  Seems to disadvantage, more then advantage, white.  See variation for what he might have been trying to avoid.

(Here white made a mistake, should have played S17? or somewhere else?)]
;B[rc];W[qb];B[sd];W[nc];B[oe];W[ob]C[The balance in the game to here is like this:

Black - a strong shape facing a loose shimari, influencing the right side.

White - a strong shape facing an extended corner stone influencing the upper side.
 - an untouched corner stone.

A white stone at D15 (or C16 maybe) would put white in a decidedly better position then black.  Black should play to diminish the effect of E17 in either direction or, if it can be managed, both directions at the same time.]
;B[pk]C[Too over concentrated at this point.  D15 easily leaves black trying to catch up.]

(;B[no]C[Would O6 have been better?];W[oo];B[on];W[np]
(;B[nn]C[Too complacent for black.  N4 may make black's position look sparse, but the white P4 shape lacks liberties and it very weak.  white N4 also builds a large amount of territory for no effort, and it works nicely with G5; a couple more stones in between and the lower side is all whites, on the 4th and 5th lines no less.  I would say this could be among black's worst moves. See variations.]
;W[mp];B[lo]C[N14 or L6?];W[mq]C[M4 achieves the same thing for white, but adds to his territory and puts pressure on M5.  This is essentially a useless move for white.]
;B[fl];W[rq]C[The group is alive white, don't over play the area, you could get left behind elsewhere on the board.]

(;B[mf]C[One must be careful to build the opponent only so much as you are building yourself, and only when the balance of territories is equal or in your favour.  I don't think it is at this point since white has all 4 corners and an area as big as your side territory on the upper side.  

A move like J16 or maybe even E15 might have been better.  Use the fact you have a lot of center influence to invade white's upper influence and reduce it.  I don't think you can make a living shape on the side, but you have many places to run to in the center.  See variation.

Fundamental rule:  Always avoid playing near your own strong groups, unless its unavoidable : )

Beyond anything else, N14 is too close to the R15 group which is very strong.]
;W[lf];B[me];W[le];B[lg];W[jf];B[ld];W[kd];B[lc];W[kc]C[White gets the entire upper side, from corner to corner, and I am not certain you have any easy method to invade the area.  N14 has allowed white to build quite a large, reasonably secure area.]

(;B[ij]C[See variations for some ideas, the most obvious being G12.    A deep invasion around H17 or D17 is pretty impossible I think, or at least would take more skill then either of us possess.  In building up The L17 stones the potential for you to take points in the area (aji) was eliminated.  One must becareful to stay aware of what aji is being eliminated with the moves yoru making and the responses the opponent is making; it factors in the analysis of the move, sometimes heavily.  

(Ok, here Whites moyo in top right is getting quite big. I'd appreciate to have some insights at how I could have entered it or reduced. I made an attempt and because of a mistake, it did little good. But supposing I didnt made the mistake (pointed later at move 135 ), would it have been an appropriate way to reduce it?)]

(;B[bg]C[G10, from here even, looks liek it will be the weak point for black.  Black's playing it seems a bit defensive though, so see variations for some other ideas.

C13 seems reasonable.  See variations for likely scenarios.

Infact going through the variations, C13 looks necessary before turning to defend G10.  White has way more to lose in that direction and you can likely end with sente, and then turn back to G10.]

(;B[hm];W[il];B[io]C[Yup.  Additionaly, this move is pretty useless.  A firmer move at H5 would at least highlight white's weakness at E5 for later, potential, use.
