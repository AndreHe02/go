C[i was lucky to win this game because of a mistake at the end,


but i mad some bad moves before (black)   feel free to make any comment]

;B[ql];W[qq];B[qp]C[is this the right site?





klin: Either site is OK.  I probabaly would do the same.];W[pq]
;B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn];W[nq];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[kj]
;B[cj]C[is there a better way?





klin: It depends on the strategy.  This move is more territory-oriented.  If the emphasis is the center, you want it to be at a higher position.]
;W[ch];B[cm]C[klin: This move (C7) usually at C6.];W[co]C[klin: Now C10, C7 are weak.  If you invade the upper side, you may be double-attacked.]
;B[hc]C[right invading point?





klin: OK.];W[fc];B[he];W[jf];B[hg];W[hi];B[jb]LB[cf:a]C[if i try to run out, i will destroy the aji of A and white will


get a big corner.





klin: OK.];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[fb];W[gb];B[gc];W[eb];B[fd];W[ec]
;B[hb];W[pg]LB[eh:a]C[very big but A will be more dangerous





klin: After the exchange around G17, w corner is strong. C14 invasion may not work any more.]
;B[cf]C[is this an urgent point or an overplay?





klin: I think it is an overplay.];W[ci];B[ef];W[ce]LB[bd:a]
C[better A?





klin: W C15 not good, should B10 attack the left side first.  The corner is safe, no need to defend.]
;B[be]C[klin: B B15 trying to get sente. Good.];W[bd];B[de]
;W[cd];B[dj];W[ei];B[jh]LB[mj:a][gq:b]C[i felt that if i can split the white stones, i have a easy game,


or is it better to play a big point like A or B





klin: I would play at F9.  K12 aggressive, not bad if you are good in fighting.]

;W[nh];B[jj]LB[ej:a]C[i thougth allso about A





klin: The ladder is in favor of b, therefore, K10 should at J11.  If w connects, B J10, w is in big trouble.]
;W[dg]C[klin: W D13 is a typical "helping move", it helps b not itself.  Ver bad move.]
;B[df];W[ej]C[is this sente? or should i take the centre stone





klin: Absolutely, take the center stone.];B[dl];W[ii];B[kk]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[gh];B[hh];W[fl];B[fm]LB[nj:a]C[if i played A the game would be easier





klin: F7 or other moves needed.  W can attack the left group, for example at B8.  It is dangerous.]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[gn];B[gl]C[risky?





klin: Very risky.];W[hl];B[gk];W[fk];B[hk];W[em];B[el];W[dn]
C[klin: W D6 too greedy. F5, E6, D6 good enough.  Later B8, B group may be killed.]
;B[fo]C[can black escape?





klin: B has to run.  If the 3 stones are killed, the game is over.]

(;B[ek];W[fj];B[eq];W[il]C[better to give atari





klin: W should block at D3.  B has no time for J8 now.];B[cq]
C[klin: W corner is in danger.];W[bl]LB[di:a][dq:b][en:c]C[very dificult WA threats at B Black will not lose the aji at


C]
(;B[cl]C[so i played this way?





klin: OK];W[bj];B[cn];W[hq]C[how to protect the aji];B[en]C[klin: E6 OK.]
;W[mk]C[the game becomes close?





klin: B is OK after getting a big corner.];B[og];W[of]C[klin: W P14 should at P12.]

(;B[oh]LB[qg:a]C[can i win with A?





klin: P12 good.];W[pf];B[lg];W[mh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mj]C[white is in byoyomi and played the easy way





klin: B should O14, P15, N12 let w decide if it want to capture the 2 stones.]

;W[cg];B[eg];W[bh];B[bg];W[ag]C[klin: B can fight ko at A14 now.  With the ko threats on the lower side, W cannot win.]

(;B[ai]LB[bm:a][ad:b]C[after this sequenz i belive it would be better to play at A.


There is also the big endgame on the top left corner at B





klin: Yes.  The endgame play is not a big deal.  B A16, W B17.]

very close again?





klin: W gained here.];B[qe]LB[qi:a]C[Was A bigger?





klin: From the result, R11 seems to be bigger.  But I would have chosen R15.]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[klin: B should R12, giving up the 3 stones.];W[qh]
;B[mb];W[jm]C[was also double sente];B[kl];W[rj]C[i think this was the turning point. white takes the lead?]
