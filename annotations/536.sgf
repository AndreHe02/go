C[Dear Reviewer.  Thank you very much for reviewing the game.
I played black (aysen) 21k* IGS.  I would apreciate any comments on the general development of the game, specially on issues regarding life and death and attack and defense.  As I reviewed the game myself i found many bad moves on my part.  I added some comments and questions on them, but of course I am willing to recive any advice, specially on the bad moves I am not aware of.

patrickb: No problem. :) One thing to watch out for in general is playing 'thank-you' moves, where you force w to cover a weakness he wanted to find time to cover anyway. These sorts of move are really problems, and I saw one or two in the game, that I'll point out at the appropriate time. I'll also comment on some of w's mistakes as well, since they may prove educational for you, too.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp]C[patrickb: Pretty standard opening stuff.]
;B[ce];W[qf];B[mc]C[patrickb: This move is a little old-fashioned, but not bad.]
;W[pj]
(;B[jq]LB[pm:c][pn:b][qn:a][nq:A]C[On this moment I thought of trying to divide q4 of q10 with  r6 (a), q6 (b), or q7 (c),  but finally played k3. Any comment?

patrickb: This isn't a bad point. Coming into the right side leads to a different sort of game, and in this case plays into a pincer that I don't really care for. It's more of an invasion, and with the bottom open, I like playing at the bottom better than playing on the right side.  Another point to consider is approaching the lower-left at A. This limits the growth of the right side. See the variations I've included for more information. In general, though, K3 is a fine move here.]
;W[pm]LB[fq:B][mq:A]C[patrickb: okay... you've split the bottom. There's not a great need to play at A or B right now, because A and B are miai - if w plays one you play the other, and if w plays A, you play B, and he extends down the left side, you can invade the lower right corner to keep him from getting too much there.]
;B[nq]LB[dj:A]C[patrickb: This move doesn't help *that* much. The left side near A is larger.]
;W[dm];B[cj];W[gq];B[bm]C[patrickb: Don't care for this move, because it forces w to protect against the more damaging corner invasion at C3, and doesn't help b a lot on the left side.]
;W[bo]LB[bk:A]TR[dm][bo]SQ[bm]C[patrickb: Okay, the first question is are the marked w stones a threat to the b stone. In a shape like this, the main point of attack for w would be at 'A' (a placement tesuji), so we need to know if white 'A' works. It turns out that it does (see the variations I've included).

Okay, it turns out that if w plays A, the marked b stone gets in trouble, so at some point, b needs to play another move in the area. The question is - is that big enough now, and if not, was B7 a bad move because of this?

First- b does not need to protect B7 right now. W catching the b stone would be worth about 12-15 points in gote, but at this point that's not big enough. W would have invested both the B5 stone and another play in gote for 15 points, and at this point, that's not enough. So, was B7 a good move? It wasn't a bad move. I'm uneasy about it because it helped w cover the C3 invasion, but it's not bad. The fact that w has a play at A later does not make this a bad move, because w would have to take gote twice to do so.]

(;B[cm]LB[ic:a][id:A][of:b][qh:C][pr:B]C[I think now that c7 was too slow and defensive,   I think now maby j7(a) or p14(b) are better in terms of territory or ofense?  But I don´t see well whats best right now.

patrickb: I agree that C7 is too small at this point. What is big? I like A and B (note that your 'a' is a little low. 'A' is a bit better. I *don't* like 'b'. Why? White has a weak point near C, where you want to aim at invading later. Playing B asks him to cover it. Now, if this guaranteed you lots of profit at the top, that wouldn't be bad, but there is still room for w to maneuver there.]
;W[dn];B[dl]C[Again too slow, right?

patrickb: Painfully small. B is in no danger here. This doesn't protect any cuts, threaten anything of W's or make much territory.]
;W[ir];B[iq]C[patrickb: Good.];W[hq];B[jr]C[patrickb: Should w respond to this? No. At worst, you catch one stone in gote, to make about 6 points, so w should take sente elsewhere.]
;W[is]LB[hs:A]C[patrickb; Bad move by w. If he's going to respond, A is better.]
;B[js];W[hr];B[no];W[fc];B[hc]C[patrickb: Good, severe move. W has come in too deep, and you want to attack. The key thing to remember is to make profit while attacking. You probably won't kill w, but you want to use the threat of doing so to take territory elsewhere.]
;W[fe];B[he]C[patrickb: Good.];W[fg];B[hg]C[patrickb: Jumped out on the wrong side. W should now push the left side flat and make some eye space at the same time.]

(;W[fi];B[dg]C[I think now better,  r3 or p14, right?

patrickb: P14 is now a pretty good move, because of your stones at the top near H13, but there's nothing wrong with D13. It keeps w from settling easily, and takes a lot of profit.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[ek];B[ho]LB[qd:C][of:B][qh:D][qq:A]C[patrickb: Interesting move... expands the bottom some, keeps w from playing to make
a substantial middle. Not bad. What are the other big points on the board? The invasion at A is very large, as is one of B, C, and D. I'll discuss the merits of B-D later.]
;W[hp];B[io];W[ip];B[jp];W[go];B[of]C[patrickb: Okay, dealing with this area is large.]

;W[oe];B[ne];W[oh];B[mg];W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[im]C[patrickb; This push doesn't do much. Invading the LL corner, or playing O12 is much larger.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[ng];B[mf];W[nh];B[nm];W[nl];B[ml];W[ol];B[mk]
;W[il]C[patrickb: Really need to invade he LR corner];B[jl]
;W[ik]
(;B[pq]C[patrickb: close, but no cigar. R3 instead. See the variations. This attachment with O3 in place is usually used to make life in a tight spot.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[patrickb; Interesting choice with the crosscut. Crosscuts like this are sacrifice moves, where you sacrifice onestone to get more out of the other stones.]
;W[qo]
(;B[op]C[Later I thought p3 or q2 instead of p4 to secure myself and define the corner.  Is there any better on the corner?]
;W[rp]
(;B[qr]C[patrickb: trying to hard. You have to make the first ko threat here, and don't get as much reduction as you'd have liked.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[oq]
(;B[nr];W[rr];B[co]C[The idea I had with c5 was to eventually try an invasion on the corner and shrink the white group, which of course didn´t work :-( after the game I tried to find a better move on the corner and I conclude it is already secure for white. Correct?  So, instead of c5 which would you recomend right now?

patrickb: Not a bad idea, but the w corner is already secure. Instead.... Take the ko at Q3, and either save the b stone, or use it to push at Q5 to reduce w more.]

(;B[md]C[patrickb: Not sure this is necessary. If you're worried about hte cut, just play T16 to solidify the corner.]
;W[sc]C[patrickb: And w takes the big endgame point. This is huge. It's sente for both sides.]
;B[sb];W[sd];B[rb]TR[rb][sb][re][se]C[patrickb: Now, if b had played in the upper right *first*, (instead of N16 for example), he'd have 4 more points (the two marked b stones would be his territory, and w would have stones at the two marked empty points), and he'd still have sente. Points like this are very large. You want to make sure you get them first.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[eh];B[bq];W[bp]C[patrickb: Nothing here, unfortunately.]

(;B[mj];W[nj];B[om]C[My idea was to press towards the right.  I would of liked to try an invasion but I couldn´t figure out weak point to attack. Are there any?

patrickb: No, not at this point. W is much too strong for that to be invadeable]

patrickb: :) Overall not bad. You got pushed around in the endgame, and the messed up lower-right corner was more than the difference in the game. The game was decided when you played the unnecessary move at K6.]
