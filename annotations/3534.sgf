C[S: Hi, here is a game I played as white, it was a very exciting game, and I ended up winning by 0.5. There was some moves I wasn't sure about, I guess I made plenty of S: mistakes and maybe took unnecessary risks. I would like you to review this game for both sides, show us where are our mistakes or failure to punish other's mistakes.

I wrote questions along with the game.

Thanks in advance.

(;W[eb];B[ci];W[pc];B[nd]
(;W[pe]C[S: I thought that cutting the 2 black stones like this would be the best, specially I have a strong group on top left, and ladder is favorable for white due to stone in bottom left, is it correct?

N: the ladder in the game is indeed favourable to you, but this only means that the variation you played is possible, not that is in your advantage.
Beware that there are other ladders in the taisha, which are not neccesarily favourable to you, even if the opposite corner is yours (example later on)
In the variations two other possibilities for you.];B[pd];W[od]
;B[qd]
(;W[oe];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[md]TR[pc]C[S: I hesitated to play here or o18 first

N: No, you must use the aji of the marked stone to remove the aji of the ladder in sente, see variations.]

(;B[fq]LB[pg:A][qg:B]C[N: black should first make an extention at 'A' or 'B']

(;W[dn]LB[cl:A]TR[ci]C[N: I don't tink it is correct to play a high move here because the low position of the marked stone. Morover you invite a move at 'A']
;B[fo]
(;W[nb];B[pb];W[ne]LB[ef:A]C[S: as the ladder seems not good anymore (unless I'm wrong), I have to capture now, I'm not so happy about the pressure on my bottom left group, but I get good result on top side

N: I think the moyo on the top (still open to invasion) doesn't compensate for the pressure on the bottom group. However if you have time you can aim at 'A']
;B[cl]C[N: this move is so perfect for black (extention, stabilization, territory and attack) that white shouldn't have allowed this to happen.]

(;W[el]LB[em:B][cn:A]C[S: was this the best move? either I defend at c7 or e3, black can invade my corner, so I thought I'd better jump in the center

N: if you defend on the right side 'A' is better shape, c7 would leave a weakness.
For jumping out i would prefer 'B'];B[co]C[S: expected move]
;W[do];B[cn];W[cp]C[S: I feel it is my first big mistake in this game... however I don't know what else to play, I seem not to have any good move, what should I do?

N: I think this move is ok, considering the starting position, you can't expect to get a fantastic result.]
;B[dm];W[fn];B[gn];W[em];B[jp]C[S: now I get an horrible corner (still reduceable), and black gets good result on bottom, I would say black is better than white here... At least it's the feeling I got

N: it is my feeling too, however you have  a nice move to strenghten yourself and press black in a low position.]

(;W[po];B[oo]
(;W[qq]C[N: This move is not good I think. Black is trying to make a moyo on the bottom. With this move you make sure he can make a nice wall. See the variation]
;B[pp];W[qp];B[on];W[qn];B[qm]C[S: Is this move correct?

N: It is a complicated joseki, however i'm not sure wether it is the best move here.  it is about the same shape as on the left side]

(;W[rm]C[N: this move is possible to, but fits too well in black's plan.]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[qk]
(;W[lp]LB[op:A]C[S: At this point as black got much more than white, something had to be done in bottom... I didn't want to live there small, so I decided to make an invasion and trying to escape in center, damaging black moyo as much as possible, however black wall on right is huge, and black is strong too on left...

What about this white move? What other option does white have to get even with black?

N: after long consideration i think this move is good, but as a probe move. By playing here you treathen to cut at 'A', if white defends the cut, then you can try to run to the center. If white tries to confine you, you can cut and reduce the black territory.]

(;B[ko]C[S: I hoped black would do the mistake to try to prevent me to make a base, this will be a difficult fight, but I had seen the cut at P4 before play M4, so I think I still got a chance]

(;W[np];B[op];W[mn]C[N: this should have been the losing move, these stones can not escape.]
;B[pn]C[S: it's sente, but I didn't understand why black played that now

N: the same move could be sente for white, it is also a good idea to first fix your shape before attacking.]
;W[qo]
(;B[ml]C[N: wrong direction and the first serious mistake by black. 
when attacking a group, always consider the cap and the keima. Here the cap is wrong for the simple reason the keima completely seals white in. Also you should push towards the side of your strong position and the keima strenghtens your 'weaker' groop.]
;W[lm];B[kk];W[jm]
(;B[gl];W[hm];B[gm];W[ik];B[eo]LB[en:A][dr:B]C[S: those 3 stones are worthless, the escape path is too difficult anyway, so I must live in corner, and after thinking about it a bit, I considered myself safe even if black D2, is it correct?

N: after black A and black B you are dead I think];W[ll];B[lk]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[mj]C[S: my purpose is to menace black to have better chance to escape from J9 afterward]
;B[ki];W[ii];B[mh]
(;W[oi]C[S: I didn't plan to save the 2 stones, just wanted to reduce black/make him heavy, but maybe it wasn't the best moment to do so, and use my sente else where. Where should I have played?

N: see var.];B[ih];W[jk]C[S: and I'm not sure I did good like this

N: it's ok]
(;B[li]C[S:but black seems to play something unnecessary? (I think white m11 didn't work, the best white could od is escape the 2 stones, but it's not the most important thing rightnow I guess

N: not unusefull, see var.
and when white escapes with his stones, the black stones in the center become weak, it is much easier to play with strong groups.]
;W[hh];B[jh];W[hj];B[oh];W[ph]
(;B[pi]C[N: this move is not good, the crosscut aims to make sabaki, or sometimes to cut white of, however hereafter black has bad aji.]
;W[nh];B[og];W[ng];B[ni];W[oj];B[nj]C[S: I was very tempted to play o9 next, but I couldn't read it well enough to feel safe, so I preferred to play Q13, I include 2 variation about the main sequence I had read at this point.

N: I included a variation that is good for you, so you could have playd that way. However because you were not sure, you made the right decision to play the safer way. (wich is still quite nice for you)]

;W[dr];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[br];B[cs]LB[fr:A]C[N: this move is very bad, it doesn't kill, so gives white extra points
'A' would have been sente to enlarge territory and defends a weakeness that costed black a lot of points.]
;W[fr];B[hg];W[gh];B[gg];W[fj];B[fh];W[fi];B[gk]
(;W[gj]LB[gi:A]C[S: if I can play K10, I'm sure to be alive, is there a way for white to live if black K10?

N: yes, you can make one eye on the bottom.]
(;B[ek];W[kq]C[S:if this move is not necessary to secure my group, I ought to have played it at G3,

N: the top is larger i think];B[gr];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[kl]
;W[km];B[jq]C[S: I had a difficult choice to make here, I didn't see J2, so I onlyu considered L2 and H2. I played L2, but now, I think I could have tried J2, menacing to connect, then whatever  black plays that is not urgent, I must make my second eye at K10. what do you think?

N: see variation]

;W[jj];B[jc];W[hc]C[S: is this the best way to do?

N: yes, strenghten your weaker side.];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[gd]
;B[kd];W[dg]C[S: I had to do something on the left side... if I fail to reduce black, I have lost this game.
What is the best move to do so?

N: this is a good move, sharp but I can't find a good way to play for black.]
;B[ef]
(;W[ch];B[eh];W[di];B[dh];W[cj];B[bi];W[dj]
(;B[ck]C[N: connecting underneath was better i think, the black bottom side can live or connect.]
;W[bj];B[bh];W[dl];B[dk];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[fk];W[bb]LB[ep:A]
C[S: I get a better result on left side than I even hoped, I start to feel I'm winning this game (which is not yet the case)

N: depends on wether you get the 'A' point i think, if black takes it next:
white 43 points (with komi) of secure territory to black about the same plus the open territory at the top middle, so it seems black is ahead]

(;B[ke]C[S: I don't feel I'm winning anymore... and I start to get nervous. I have to play sente moves by all cost and reduce black to the maximum.... R14 is not really sente, I feared that after R14, black plays S13 (is that move working?)
anyway, I had to try to avoid black to reduce totally that part on the right side...]
;W[qf];B[rf]C[S: I'm happy black plays here...];W[rg];B[re]

(;W[lg]C[S: I'm sure there was better than this...

N: yes];B[ri];W[rh];B[ji];W[hk];B[lc]C[S: good for me... black gives me sente, now I must try hard]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[ae]C[S: due to C12 & C13, this should finish sente for white]

N: difficult exercise but it seems about equal to the variation.]

(;B[pl];W[ge]C[S: ran out of obvious sente moves...

N: always try to reduce the biggest area, if your oppontent plays tenuki, you have more follow-up moves.]

(;B[lb]C[N: black should defend here, it seems even the game-losing move]
;W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[jd];W[gf];B[if];W[fg];B[ig];W[ff];B[eg]
LB[ee:A]TR[lb]SQ[ie]C[S: like I planned. I feel good about having kept sente and reducing black a lot... I feel I'm winning now (not yet the case)

N: the triangled stone won three points in gote
The squared move was worth three points in sente. (compare variation on move 226) but now white could still play at 'A']
;W[jn];B[io];W[gs];B[hs];W[es];B[an];W[gs];B[oh];W[og];B[fs]
;W[aq];B[fl]C[N: better kept as a ko treath];W[cq]C[maybe should take G1 first?]

(;B[iq]C[N: loses sente];W[ga];B[ia];W[ee]LB[ed:A]C[S: gote, but 2 points

N: this is larger then two points, if black plays there he might be able to get to 'A'.]
;B[sj];W[sl];B[qs];W[mf]C[S: gote and 2 points

N: again slightly larger];B[ms]C[S: black mistake?

N: at least a style error. In an famous endgame problem it is shown that one should always defend/attack the largest territory, even if there are only one point gote moves leftj.]

[ag][bg][dg][jg][ch][mj][mk][nk][ol][om][pm][fn][go][hp][ip]
[gq][hq][pr][ns][os]C[N: in this game, black took a good start, mainly due to some white errors (losing sente in the upper right, creating a weak group in the bottom left and doubtfull joseki choise in the bottom right). While attacking the white invasion, black gave to much away to white and in the endgame white succeeded in taking most of the big points.
As an advice to white: when you are faced with a moyo always try to see wether there is a way to reduce it and meanwhile build strenght.
