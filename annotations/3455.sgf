;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[qf]C[teabing: I usualy play at O17 or N4, but I wanted to play something different. I know that this is playable.]

(;W[pi];B[qj];W[mp]TR[pf][qf][pi]C[teabing: I wanted to reduce black side before it expands. Thats why I chose not to defend the R14 group. Do you think that was wrong?

yes, even if N4 is sente in itself (black will probably answer at R5), you then need to play another move on the lower side, and you also need to play a move on the right. If you consider N4 a forcing move (kikashi), you can play like this -- but it clearly isn't, as it gives B secure territory in the lower right]

(;B[qi]C[this move is a bit soft, W can make sabaki]
(;W[po];B[ph]C[a bit slow... B should attack the group as a whole, not use 3 moves to capture one stone]
;W[nf]C[this is heavy - black has already invested so many moves to capture these stones that it's not really efficient anymore. You should instead take advantage from his tenuki in the lower right and wait and see how you should play in the upper right. However, in the game, black's attack fails and he falls behind.]

;B[jd]C[this move is highly dubious - black seems hell-bent on keeping up the attack on the right side white group and ignores territory completely.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[dj]C[now white is winning...];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd]C[teabing: This isn't a joseki, right? I wonder how should I play after this.

usually black pushes at F18 before playing hane here. However, I don't think you can take advantage of that in this position.]
;W[be];B[bc]
(;W[cf];B[kf]C[F18 is left as a very urgent point - it is almost double sente and makes a big difference in points.]
;W[lb]C[M18 is endgame - you should strengthen your center group instead. If you feel like 'daring black to kill you' you should take a big point like J3. If black played M18 you would be happy with his slow move, right? ...]

(;B[mc]C[.. of course if black answers your move, it's good :-P]
;W[fb];B[db];W[mk];B[lh];W[mh];B[kg];W[oh];B[pg]C[these two stones are already small... black has no hope of attacking white anymore - playing R5 is much more substantial (and secures his group)]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[qg];B[pi]
(;W[jp];B[mm];W[qo]C[I think this move is not good, see next comment.]
;B[nq];W[ol]TR[ng][og][pg][ph][ni][oi][pi][qi][pj][qj][pk]C[teabing: Do you think there still is a chance to kill black, or is it too late? What could be played instead of P8?

P8 is usually the right shape, but in the game O9 is an intense counterattack. You should probably play O8  instead. Another idea is simply to strengthen at O5 and let black run out.

I think the main problem with your play here is the exchange R5/O3 - it makes you thin in the lower right. normally you would like to make your center strong and let black link up under R5, but now you've removed all options from him other than 'death or glory'.]
