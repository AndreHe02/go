C[dear reviewer, I won this game by a small amount, yet i am not
convinced that i am a stronger player than my opponent.
i would like to know
a) what is my current strength (24 kyu ?)
b) the answers to my questions during the game (see comment)
c) what else should i attend to?
I also commented on my thoughts at certain points, hope this
helps. Thank you

z:
Game commented by "zenjutsu" (10k* IGS).  Comments to be preceeded by a "z:" (as above).  Please take all of my commentary with a healthy dose of skepticism, as I am also still learning a great deal about go.  Regardless, I will try to give commentary on anything that I can.

First, winning by 18.5 points is not "a small amount".  18.5 is a concrete win.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj]C[z: San ran sei.];W[nc];B[qf]
;W[jd];B[jp]C[z: B working for double wing?  If so, that's always a good way to make territory.  Be aware that the LR corner is not secure yet, as a 3-3 invasion will live.]
;W[dj];B[fq];W[dn];B[qm];W[dr];B[mq];W[qq]C[At this point, i thought R3 could do me no harm because of R7
and N3. I considered letting white live small in the corner if
necessary (10 points or less)

z: I'm not entirely certain, but I believe that N3 and R7 are both too far from the corner to fully protect the corner.  I feel that white will live in this corner.  As you say, perhaps you can force white to live small.]
;B[cc]C[I was in doubt. This lonely stone looks vulnerable. Maybe extending
from the right is better? Or protecting the RU corner with Q17?

z: This stone is not vulnerable.  A 3-3 invasion is an excellent way to reduce your opponent's territory.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fb]
;W[gc]C[I felt that further moves like G18 could only help white, so
i moved on to R4

z: Good.];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[rq];W[op];B[nq];W[rr];B[rp]
;W[sr];B[qr];W[pr];B[nr];W[os];B[qs];W[jj]C[This is where i thought white were alive. My opponent apparently
thought otherwise.

z: Ack!  White is not yet alive in LR corner!  O1 or S1 will kill.]
;B[ns]C[Just to make sure white's dead, and in case of future ko threats]
;W[jn]TR[go][fo]SQ[nd][ne]C[To me it looked like a strong white move. How can i best counter
such a move?

z: W is working to create a large framework through the L and center.  Perhaps a play around the triangle marked points would counter?  ...or a play around the square marked spots to attack from a different angle?]
;B[lo]C[z: Ack.  Only worth about 10 pts in gote.  Better to keep sente and/or play a larger play at this point in game.]
;W[fo]C[Again a strong move by white. This time i could only do what
i did, right?];B[ho]SQ[po][pn][on][oo][nn][lp][mo][no][np][mp]
C[z: Not certain I like this B play.  It demonstrates the inefficiency of M5 stone.  M5 serves only to secure the death of P4.  This stone's death is not necessary to ensure the life of B's bottom or left sides.  M5 does secure some additional territory in the marked area (approx 10 pts), however playing M5 at (for example) H4 would have secured more than 10 pts, and threatened to press into W's territory.  However, after giving up sente with the M5 play, this stone just might have the right idea.  It offers to concede the F3 stone and territory, but W can only capture that stone at the risk of losing a great deal of territory.  At this point, I think B is ahead by about 10 -15 points (note that my score-counting ability is sub-par, so take with a grain of salt).  Also, B's points are all very established, whereas W's center is _very_ reducable.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[gn]C[Is this a mistake by white?

z: I think so.  Playing G4 first indicates W planed to capture the F3 stone.  It also allowed B to strengthen his G5 stone. If W's initial intent was to guard the center, then he should have G6 instead of G4, thus _not_ strengthening B's G5 stone. It would have conceded the survival of the F3 stone, but it would have done so without strengthening B first, therefore enabling B to make a strong push into the center.]
;B[fp];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[eo];W[en];B[ep];W[do]C[Allthough i managed to get a substantial area, i think white
has a big advantage with the wall G6

z: I agree.  The play from my last comment to here felt too slow. ...although I admit I'm not certain where more effective stones would have been.]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[lm]C[This move brought me back into the match i guess]
;W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[ll];W[kk];B[lk];W[lj];B[li]
(;W[ki]C[What if white had done what i thought he would (see var)

z: This stone is, IMHO, a _huge_ mistake by W.  W should have N10 (as in your alternative).]
;B[mj];W[kj]C[z: ?  Who cares if B captures the M10 stone.  W should have used sente to make some points.  This is a mistake by W.]
;B[mi];W[kh];B[ia]C[I wouldn't let white stretch the wall , so i sort of tried to
distract him. Is there a better move?

z: Monkey jumps are about 10 points (usually).  However had you played Q18, you would gain about 7-8 points, prevent W from a few, and maintain sente by threatening to M17.]
;W[pb];B[md]C[i thought this exchange was good for black, giving white the
corner and connecting to the J19 group.

z: I disagree.  The corner is worth points.  Connecting to the J19 group is not.  Your UL does not need to connect to live.]
;W[gb];B[ga];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[pc];W[ob];B[kc]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[kd];B[lc];W[kf];B[ic]C[With this move i tried to move into the center. White's territory
is still awfully big, and N14 entrance is wide open];W[id];B[hc]
;W[hd];B[hb];W[mb];B[fe]C[I was hoping to get a break-through somehow. Were there any possibilities
at this point of the match? What should i have done instead?

z: This attack does not look possible.  Perhaps D3 or something around O14?]
;W[gd]C[z: Unnecessary.];B[cj]C[z: Good idea, however I don't think it should be able to live.]
;W[ci]C[z: I think W should have C9 instead.  B has less room to run before running into C14.]

seems ok though

;B[me];W[ld];B[mc];W[nd];B[ne];W[lb];B[kb];W[na]C[z: ?  Unnecessary.]
;B[oc]C[at this point i had already given up on the two groups inside
white territory. Is there any chance i could have got part of
white's corner back?];W[fh]C[z: Unnecessary.  Another quick score estimate has B up by about 10 points.]
;B[la];W[ma];B[sd];W[sc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[qa];B[od];W[nb]

;B[oj];W[qj];B[ig]C[z: Both W and B are making attacks that appear doomed from the start.  However, such attacks are part of the learning process in order to develop a "feel" for what will live and what will die.]

;B[bh];W[bj];B[hi];W[gi];B[kn]C[it's not gonna work, leave it be

z: Yep.];W[jl]C[z: Unnecessary.  All this does is fill in a point of W's.]
;B[ae]C[z: Good!  Worth 2 points (protect your point at A17, cost W a point at A14).]
;W[af];B[ad];W[bf]C[z: Unnecessary.];B[la];W[qh]
(;B[qg]C[how to handle this situation? Many Faces says S9 is my best move.
Is this correct? (see var)

z: First, Many Faces is a great program which I would highly recommend to any go player (I'm using it right now to review your game).  However, the game's playing logic only results in a rank on IGS of the teens (I think).  Currently I spank MF handily, and I'm not the strongest player around.  Basically what I'm saying is that using MF as a primary learning tool might not be your best reference.  It's handy, but use your own analysis.

Anyway, I agree with MF.  Your Q14-ish group is already strong enough to get 2 eyes and live unconditionally.  Playing S9 ensures that W simply cannot get 2 eyes.

Regardless, I don't think W will make 2 eyes.];W[rl];B[rh]C[z: Ack.  I like S7 more.  W needs to respond to S7 or else B will S9.  After W respond (such as at S9), B can T11.]
;W[ri];B[sh];W[si];B[rg];W[rm];B[qk];W[ql]C[z: ??  W _must_ S9 to keep his stones connected.]
;B[pk]C[z: Ack!  Just S10 or T10 and kill the group.];W[qn]
;B[sj]C[z: Yes!  Good job.];W[pm];B[pn];W[po];B[on];W[oo];B[qo]

;W[fj];B[ei];W[hg]C[now i give up on the infiltration.

z: Yeah, it wasn't really going anywhere.];B[ka];W[hj]C[z: Unnecessary.  Just fills in his own territory and thus loses a point.]

[sa]C[z: Overall, a good job.  I'd recommend continuing to use IGS and the GTL to improve your understanding of go.  Also, www.goproblems.com is a great learning site, and gobase.com (or .org?  I forget) is a great reference site.

Please note that I did not estimate your rank.  Doing so just isn't realistic based on a single game.  If you want a rank estimate, then play 20 ranked games on IGS and let it's system do the work. After 40 or 50 ranked games, your rank will stabilize a bit in their system.

Keep on playing, and don't hesitate to contact me with any follow-up questions!]

(;W[mj];B[ki];W[kj]C[What happens next?

z: Next, B needs to ensure the survival of his two stones.  Pressing deeper into W's center might allow W to capture, such as in the continuation of your alternative move tree.]

;W[mi]C[z: ...begin work to capture B.];B[mh];W[nh];B[mg];W[ng]
C[z: Now B is being seperated.  While the center B group may escape, W can build a nice wall to use to attack B's UR corner perhaps? *shrug*  Not certain, just guestimating.  Anyway, I feel that you are correct, white should have played N10.]
