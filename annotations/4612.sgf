C[

Dear reviewer,



thank you very much for taking some time to review this. I was playing black, and i lost all the battle in this game



No problem, hope you enjoy the review!];B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[cn]
C[a bit unusual to approach directly instead of taking the empty corner]
;B[fp];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]LB[jq:a][pd:b]C[A and B look to be the biggest points.

Completing the shape, and taking the empty corner.];B[ce];W[ch]
SQ[bk][cj][cl]C[Good move. White combines pincer with extension.



The double two space extension is a little vunerable though. Later perhaps there is a chance for Black to exploit this.]

(;B[bc]C[not a joseki.];W[pd]C[seems strange not to answer black. I wouldn't want black to settle.]
;B[ec]LB[cc:a]C[feels like overplay.



What is wrong with Black A?];W[dd]C[good];B[ed];W[de];B[ee]
SQ[bc][ce]C[the two marked stones are unhappy];W[cf]LB[df:a]
C[extending to A seems fine.];B[df];W[cd];B[db];W[be];B[bd]
C[black ends in gote, overall still favourable for white]
(;W[jd]LB[mc:a]C[a big point. Perhaps a tighter extension is better though. 



I would consider a move at A];B[pg]C[a slightly unusual approach, small keima is most normal.]
;W[qi]LB[nc:a][nd:b][qf:c]C[I don't know if I would pincer.

I can see arguements for A or B.

C doesn't look so great.



A and B help resolve K16 overextension/vunerability];B[ql];W[hq]
C[yes, attacks the incomplete shape];B[gq]LB[kq:a]C[the wrong idea.

Black must try to pincer around A.

To play like this makes it too easy for White.];W[hp];B[lq]
SQ[bq][eq]C[aji remains in black's shape];W[bq];B[cr]C[necessary, but painful]
;W[qq]C[a big point.];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr]

(;W[mj];B[nm];W[om];B[nl];W[nk];B[nn];W[ok]
(;B[lh]C[feels too vague.

We have to consider where we want White to run too.]

;W[mi];B[kg];W[qn];B[po];W[km]C[looks good but, not sure it works]

(;B[jl]C[I know this is bad

but i dont know how to respond



Well you had a chance here to make it complicated, but overall White played the better game. Normally for a GTL review you need to ask more questions. Go is not about one fight, you need to look at your games more deeply to understand why you win or lose.]
