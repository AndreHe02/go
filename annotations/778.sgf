RE[B+46.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[varg: Hello Matt. Some general thoughts about the game. Unfortunately this was a rather early decided game and white did not create complications. So the review might be a bit less of value than it could be. Still there was enough to comment.
Generally your reasoning in the game is good. There are some weak points though.
1. Big points are important not only in the opening, but also later in the game.  When the left side was more or less played out (from ove 69 onwards) it was time to reinforce the upper right. I guess you know you were well ahead at that time (because of your comment at move 87). So looking around the board you might have realized that the upper side was the only place where white could hope to turn the tables. So knowing how far you were ahead would have made the decision to play there easy but you played comparatively small points on the left side.
2. tactics. you outfought white everywhere. But that is partly due to whites lack to see his chances to fight back (moves 14,43,59 are prime examples). Well tactics is probably the problem of any kyu player. The only way to get stronger here is to do go problems though that is sometimes rather work than fun :-(

I hope the review will help.  And sorry for my clusy english.

to any readers: I started my comments with varg: , Matts commets are not marked in such a way.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]C[Since I've been playing quite a few handicap games, I have had a tendency to use the san-ren-sei opening and concentrate on using the 4-4 point effectively.  I'd be interested to know your analysis of any mistakes I made in this opening.]
;W[jp];B[pj]C[He seemed to be playing a touch passively so I decided to trade star points.  As black, I would come out ahead.
varg: trading star points is ok. the outcome of the game is essentially the same.]

(;W[cf]C[... but he attacked instead.];B[fc]LB[fd:A][ch:B]C[varg: This stone is too low. A stone on the third line is a rather defensive move (the corner is open for an invasion though. compare the variation at move 69) It goes for territory. But in a 4-4 point oppening and especially a san ren sei opening you stress quick development. So a play at A a line higher is more cosistent. A stone on the 4th line is biased to exert it´s power toward the center which is important in this game. To play the high one point extension on the white kakari is not always correct though. If white had stones around k17 you would like to defend the corner stone and play low.  You could consider pincering at B or somewhere there too. This is also be quick development but would lead to serious fighting.]
;W[dj];B[qn];W[nq];B[jj]C[I was pretty happy with this.  The tengen point seemed pretty big to me at the time.
Varg: It is.];W[jl]LB[mj:A]C[Varg: this white move is to passive. The Tengen (k10) stone serves at least two purposes  here. It threatens to build a big moyo (which will need further stones to be a real threat) and it affects fights along the sides (for example it is a ladder breaker to any ladder running into the center). The white stone does nothing against the first.  A stone at A would affect both purposes.]
;B[hk]LB[ij:A]C[Varg: you are taking chances here. If white willingly follows your way of play now, you get a good result. So white will probably not be so obedient. If white cuts at A a fight will occur. see variation.]

(;W[lj]C[varg: this is the start of a game loosing sequence.]
;B[kk]C[varg: Striking at whites weaki point. Instead of hardening blacks position white might run with his m10 stone. see var.]

(;W[on]C[This last exchange seems flawed to me.  I don't think my move or white's response was optimal but I can't explain why I think that.  Comments would be welcome.  My thought was to connect to the lower stone and keep sente, but I think that white could have prevented that had he played more aggressively.

varg: the whole thing before is flawed (for white). The overall result greatly favors black.  As for the last exchange:  1. you need not stay connected. If white cuts you invade the corner, so you could tenuki ( the easiest way to keep sente :) )  2. black is far ahead, so white should not answer q8 as it does not yet threaten the live of the center stones. p6 doesn´t do much to build white territory because of the gap at l8. White should look now for a way to create complication.
When one is behind that far one has to do a bit of gambling. So maybe white should enter the black moyo now.
3. Your move q8 leaves a weakness at r9. see var. had you played r9 instead there would be none.
4. If white wants to play locally fixing the gap at l8 is more important. Black could not very ignore that. see variaton2]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[hm];W[km];B[io]C[Trying to force him to overconcentrate while building thickness.
varg: overconcetrating is a nice idea. But you are spreading your stones thinly now. If white can somehow manage to cut them he will be happy again. see variation 2  at move 37 for a hint.
there is an other reason this move is maybe not so good:
white may not defend the cut at k7 but play on the lower side, maybe h3. Then your move only induced white to make territory. So it only forces White to play where he wanted to play anyway.]

(;W[jn];B[cn]C[varg: good point :)]
(;W[fq]C[Would c5 or e7 or e6 have been better for him?
varg: e7 would be cut through, bad.
e6 would usually be bad here, but there are some tricks left if you are unaware of them.
usually you would play e6 only if you had a moyo to build on the lower side which is not possible here. for the trick see the variation
c5 usually is a good move when there is a stone on the starpoint d10, as d10 doesn´t allow black an ideal extension from his two stones. But here black has stones on the H line to help, so white would only further weaken his d10/c14 stones. This is also the reason why white would not like d6.]
;B[en];W[fo]C[varg: not a good move, helping black. this is not a forcing but a "thanks you" move]
;B[fn];W[go]
(;B[dh]TR[dg][ch][di]C[I considered this move to be very important to my position.  If I could cut his two stones I could either kill both his groups or make myself very thick while forcing him to live small.  I succeeded, but comments on the following splitting exchange would be very welcome.

varg:Cutting is a nice idea but you cannot cut this way if white plays correct (see var at move 49). The triangeled V are usually the points to play here. The other V is inferior. The two moves on the fourth line are reduction plays. you help white to conect and live, but you get stones on the outside, which regarding your moyo is good. The deeper point is an invasion  point.  There are tons of joseki for that one.   Your problem is that you have three somewhat rivaling goals here:
1. You want to make use of the black stones around E6 without weakening them.
2. You want to keep white out of the upper left corner.
3. you want to complete your moyo on the left side.

Now look at the variations and see which of the aims they fullfill. I personaly like the "cut throat" variation 3 though it makes concessions on point 3.]

(;W[bi]C[varg: bad.];B[bg];W[dm];B[dn];W[cl];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi]
;W[fj];B[gj]C[At this point, looks like he will have to live small and I am very thick here.

varg: well, you defended your moyo, but black will not live small. see var.
you ignored white g5. that was ok, but now there are those nasty white stones around F10 and C8.]

(;W[fl];B[gm]C[varg: good, now the black weakness is gone.]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[hj];W[in];B[hn]C[varg: this is wasting a ko threat.]
;W[ho]
(;B[el]C[I saw a snapback here if he made a mistake, and a lot of eye-killing, territory-reducing potential.  Comments welcome.

varg: I am sorry, I don´t see the snapback. If you can kill this is nice. But the move white found is one destroyinng this hope. I tried a some variations starting a move earlier, which did not succeded (I do attach only two, I attached too may ayway) . So the essence is that either I am blind or a killing is not possible. So some general thoughts if a killing is not possible:  1. the territory of white here is 15 points at most, so reduction moves are too small now, as for example the black upper right corner is still open to a 3-3 invasion. play here only if you can keep sente (absolute sente = moves white has to answer by all means)
2. trying to kill and not succeding is wasting ko threats.  3. you can invade the lower left corner now on the 3-3 point (see var)  without loosing anything (exept sente of course) as your stones around c6 are connected to the center. white might spoil your intention to keep the ko threats and to invade the lower left (see the variation on this) by playing b7 living, but this is a gote move.


Jumping into the corner (or preventing it) is certainly the biggest here (unless you can kill). Unfortunately it is gote. You are already in the early endgame, maybe the late middlegame. So (at lest roughly) estimating the value of moves and playing the big poits becomes important. The concept of sente/gote is more important though. You cannot kill the white group. Moves reducing are worth less then 10 to 15 points.
Invading the lower left is worth maybe 20 to 30 points. But I suspect both are gote.
What else is there: If white still wants to win this game he would have to destroy most of blacks moyo on the upper side (only possible if black makes mistakes). A move like black  q17 (usually too slow) closes the corner and makes it difficult to live on the upper side. I cannot tell you how big a move there is but it is by no means small especially as a 3-3 invasion against a lonely 4-4 stone is sente.

I think I would jump into the corner imediately though it is gote. White would not play b7 anymore then, as he is alive. So black would reach two purposes, invading the corner and keeping the kothreats.   Sorry for the long and maybe confusing text. I just try to give some thoughts.]

(;W[cj]C[I did not expect him to do that.  Again I think he could have been more aggressive.

varg: this move was his right. It kills any aji to kill you might have had. he was alive before e8 because of this move. maybe it was not the biggest but the most secure. Now C11 is one eye and white will have no difficulty to make another around b10.]
;B[dl]C[varg: taking gote. I would not answer(white b9 later lives or on black b9 white b8 lives, any capture is small)]
;W[cm];B[fk]C[varg: small gote];W[ek];B[em]C[varg: gote, this time white does realize it]
;W[ro]C[varg: protecting the corner is not small but here it means to admit defeat.]
;B[qo]C[I played here to be able to block at s6 with sente later.
varg: a reasoable plan. Still the upper right is more important.]
;W[qp];B[rn];W[rp]C[... and it worked.

varg: you solidified your position here in sente. That is nice.]
;B[cp]C[I figured I'd push in to reduce as far as I possibly could.  I was also hoping to build up to a position to where I could jump in and attack the left center white group.

varg: 3-3 ivasion still works, but a bit harder to read than before. It would be still nice. Left center white group alive even if you get miracoulously down to the second line without white answering (see var2). Still the reasoning is fine. you look for the right things, though you do not yet see them clear enough.]

(;W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[do]
(;W[ep];B[jk]C[This was gote but removed what I thought was very bad aji.

varg: you are far ahead, so playing save, removing bad aji is good. though I do not see it here. If you want to remove bad aji the upper right is still the place to play.]
;W[nc]C[When I saw this I decided I had to try to push hard to kill.  I figured I was thick enough to succeed if I didn't make any serious mistakes.

varg: finaly one of you detected the big area to play. white might live provided he plays correctly.]
;B[oc]C[varg: good. Not because it closes the corner( it does not), but because it makes white heavy. Nearly invariably white has to play o16 or give up his stone. This two stones would be like a milstone around the white neck :). white desperately needs to make eyeshape, he cannot afford to play heavy here.]

(;W[qf]C[varg: white shows the right attitude here: don´t try to keep a sigle stone inside enemy territory.]
;B[qe]C[I felt I needed to protect the corner here.

varg: it helps white. white only wants to live somehow. attaching usually strengthens BOTH stones.]
;W[re]
(;B[qd]C[I didn't want to expose myself to an atari from the outside so I didn't play s16.

varg: difficult to say. In a way that is correct attitude: don´t help white, but in a way it is submissive too. white can live quite comfortably on the right now. and you made an empty triangle without need. I will show you an all out example how white might live. see also the variation a move earlier for a maybe better startegy by black.]

(;W[ob];B[pb]C[Don't know if this was a mistake or not.

varg: difficult.  white is trying to make sabaki or at least it looks like that. So white is prepared to give up stones to get shape somewhere. see my example before.]

(;W[nb]C[Should he have attacked at p16?
varg: this white move is very bad. White needs to make shape desperately, but now he has burdened himself with a heavy eyeless group. There is not the slightest bit of an eye yet. p16 or maybe n18 were much better
see the var];B[nd]C[I felt very good after this exchange.

varg: yes! white didn´t make shape now white is ripe to receive the final blow.]

To say it again: this is only an example, an other player might try it differently and find bettermoves.
