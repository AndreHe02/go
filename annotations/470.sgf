C[In this game I play white.
I would to get some comments on the fuseki, because I went in trouble when I tried to reduce black on the left side.
Even if I managed to live, it cost me a lot.
In the middle game I abandoned a lot of points to black in the center. Could I have evitated it ?]

;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[gr];B[nc]C[Black should have finnished the joseki in the bottom first by playing at A mostly to enlarge the moyo.]
;W[pf]C[Usually I like to play this "support move" low, but here this move seems just right as white needs to enlage to the center to competer with black moyo. Of course white could have played a pincer as well, but this is good and simple.]
;B[kd];W[go]C[Good. Black failed to play the keypoint regarding the border of two moyos, so naturally white does it. Suddenly the board looks like there are more white stones out there.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[gl];W[fn]LB[hm:a]C[Usually not as good move as A, and this case is no exception. It is true that you reduce the number of liberties of the black group by one and potentially gain some endgame leverage because of that, but having an extra stone at A looking in the center and controlling the whole board, makes small endgame look irrelevant in comparision.]
;B[en];W[gn];B[fl];W[fc]SL[kd]LB[hl:a][pb:b][qh:c][ie:d][ic:e]
[kf:f]C[I am not sure of the timing of this move. Black can not close the whole half of the bord with any single move, especially since the marked stone is so far from the corner. I would have played hane at A, or perhaps B to provoke black C to attack. Also as I like to try out different moves, I might have wanted to play here in a way that would allow me to play light reducing moves like D while building my own moyo (D-E-F).]
;B[hc]LB[dc:a][eb:b]C[This move is bad in my option. Black should now give white an easy life in the corner. I would have played either A or B.]
;W[fe]SL[dj][fl][gl][fm]C[The marked stones in the center left create lots of thickness. There is an old go proveb which says that one should never approach thickess, and by jumping out you are approaching this thickness. Simply living in sente in the corner would have been enough.
Your opponent is very strong here - if there is a easy way to connect to live, do that - here you can\t conect, but you can easily live, so why not if that is rewarded by a handful of points as well?]

[gn][fn][go][gp][gr][fq][er][dq][cq]LB[qp:a][ro:b][ql:c][qm:d]
C[Wrong direction. The marked white stones emit awfully lots of thickness towards the bottom right corner, and playing towards thickness is bad, no matter who that thickness belongs to. Instead a play at A or B or C is the best. D is a modern move which might also work well in this position.]
BM[1];B[qk]C[Now black is absolutely secure.];W[qi];B[gg]LB[db:a]
[rp:b]C[Black attacks white while, but this move is a bit loose and inefficient. A would probably have been better locally, B globally.]
;W[on]LB[ro:a]C[Wrong. Black has a two space extension on third row which should be attacked by A. A makes territory and attacks the eyebase of the black group. After when black jumps out, you can decide how to handle the situatiobn and how to use the big juicy wally of yours in the bottom center.]

[bo:e][bq:f][cn:g][km:h][lm:i][gc:j]C[I don't think it was the right move to do, but what else should I have done ?




Answer: Not to invade at all - your invasion is a kamikaze move. The marked white stones are a weak group that already have been attacked (slowly) by one move you decided to ignore and now you create another weak group right next to it? One of the white groups should die a painful death, probably the new one.


Instead of making invasions at random, count the score - before this move the game is practically even if white plays a sensible move, so there is no need for desperate overplays. Even if there weren\t another weak white group around, this play would probably be too deep.


The biggest points on the board for white are now A, B and C.

  Also D to G is pretty much sente and big endgame move. This is so because you played f6.

You must also remember that you have a huge moyo on the bottom - by plaing a move like H or I, you threathen to surround really a lot of points. The problem with that strategy at the moment is the marked weak group which should be settled before any other moves by playing J or somethiong else around there.]
;B[cg]C[One row lower is probably better. Or one line higher.]

C[This move has no purpouse. Just strenghtens white. White can play A as B is no threat, see var B.]

(;W[fg]C[You should have given the atari first.];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[ed];W[gf];B[gc]C[The black top is huge but the side is now much smaller. Considering how couragious your original invasion was this is of course a good result.]
;W[pc]LB[rp:a][pl:b]C[A is slightly better as it also weakens the three black stones. Now the juicy peep at B would be interesting.]
;B[ph]LB[rp:a]C[Had white a stone at A now, he could play in agressive manner and push up.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[qj];B[pj];W[rk];B[ql];W[nl]LB[il:a][rp:b][ob:c]
C[Problem is that black can now play at A or so and enlarge a moyo yet again for himself while reducing whites.

Also the big move on the board is B, not the move played. Also C is getting bigger and bigger.

I categorize moves into three groups based on how they make/destroy territory:

1. Moves that do not make or destroy territory.
2. Moves that make or destroy territory.
3. Moves that make and destroy territory.

Moves in group one are dame and should not be played :)

Moves in group three (3) are twice as valuable as moves in group 2. Examples: B makes territory for white and prevents black from making territory here - I call a move like this "a double territory move". The move white played is a single territory move - a move that really only makes territory, but has little effect on the surroundngs otherwise.

Actually to be technically correct, the white move does not make anyterritory, but only influence, but some of it should turn into territory.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[pg];B[oe];W[ob]C[A double territory move.]
;B[jl];W[hl]LB[jn:a]C[Too slow. White can try to break into this potential black moyo later, now a move like A or so would be better.]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[hm];B[jk]LB[hj:a]C[Mistake. A better.]
;W[ij];B[jj];W[mj]LB[kn:a]C[I guess the purpuse of this move was to attack black? Anyhow, it is the wrong direction of play.

White is leading on the board if he simply collects the points from the bottom center with A or similar move.

Not too many comments after this.

The three main problems seem to be:

1. Ignoring thickness.

2. Ignoring weak groups.

3. Ignoring the score.

Improve in these areas and you will be stronger.];B[ii];W[hj]
