C[ Hi Reviewers.  This is typical high kyu zany hijinks.  I was playing black, and i mostly got outplayed, which I feel I understand.  What i don't get is when I make this huge wall, I didn't use it well to attack him.  From move 129 onward, I feel like I should have come out of that much better.  any help?

Thanks,   karl];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq]C[The variation is more easy going and more un der controll...]

Yes. White has succed to play P6 finally whi le making stronger his middle group of stone s. Since black clump h as some options to esc ape, black has to play Q7 or even R7 or R8. Always be careful of a voiding this shape.(vl kplk)]
;B[nl];W[pm]C[After this, complicate d struggle turns bad f or black. It's like al l effort lost in one m oment. This is why str ong fighting is not al ways best kind of play ing. When you start fi ght from beggining, ev en much stronger playe rs don't know sometime s what will happen. Be tter to think first an d don't actualize any idea you get.

(;B[pg]C[Waste move. Since blac k obtained some kind o f strenght from previo us action, he doesn't need to defend here. Black position is on l arge scale, so black's move shall be likewis e. When you are strong than atack! Or defend places which need it. So probably best move here was some kind of connection-see variat ions. Generaly any mov e which acts as a ladd er braker do the work. Only if it's too far there are some posibil ities of white peeping .]

(;B[dn]C[I'm pretty happy with my play up to now, but I'm uncertain of a number of choices. What is the biggest, most urgent move? It looks like I can threaten to kill the white group with H2 It looks like, even though we're 80~ moves in, I can do an opening type move at F17 or D15. It seems like I can also attack at J9. What criteria do you use to choose between these choices?

Black D6 is not bad as it cut off white corn er. But as you mension ed, there is posible t o attack at J9. So, be tter order of moves is like this: keep press ing white clump of sto nes (starting at J9), until white needs to d efend. Than at RIGHT m oment to play D6 and i t's perfect.(vlkplk)]
;W[cl];B[cn]C[This was good move fro m black!];W[cp]C[those last 3 moves seem to make white much strong, seems like a big mistake

Maybe yes. But it seem s complicated and resu lt is not clear.(vlkpl k)]

(;W[di];B[ej];W[bo];B[bm];W[do]C[White D5 I think is  n ot good, since it help s black to solve situa tion more quickly. Suc h position is better t o leave for later use. Noone knows what may happen...(vlkplk)]

C[this is the territory influence exchange I spoke of.  It looks as if I am primed to wreak havoc with my wall on Q-R, but.....

Good idea, just you sh ouldn't allow white to connect. It's surpris ing, how many points i t takes, when one can push through and destr oy connection along si de.(vlkplk)]
;B[gc];W[jc]C[He attacks my stone and takes territory

Problem in this situat ion is, that white has already some stones i n the middle. But sinc e they have no eye, th e strategy would be li ke this: make a move w hich strengthten black stone at G17 and than see white response. W hite has to take care for two groups: K17 an d K9 group. But even a fter some defending mo ve, black can aim at d ividing them. While do ing this, white's uppe r left corner is falli ng to difficulties. (vlkplk)]

(;B[lc]C[Perhaps instead I should have done a 2 or 3 point jump at G-14 or G-15, and let him pick which stone to defend.

Black M17 is wrong dir ection of play. Basic rule is: use wall (or any kind of strong for mation of stones) for pushing opponents ston es AGAINST it. Usualy such a big wall doesn' t die so easy :) (vlkplk)]

;W[lf]C[From now it seems no u se for black to try so mething on white middl e groups, they are alm ost connected. Black could give up pl aying there and shift his attention to his s ingle and VERY weak st one at G17. Actualy, b lack had to think abou t it much more before. ..(vlkplk)]

Yes, poor result for b lack. During this sequence, black could stop at AN Y time and play elsewh ere. It's no use to pr otect some single ston es, when there are muc h bigger points left o n board.(vlkplk)]
