AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi,

   I am Mohit, I been playing Go for about 2 years now, and 8K on KGS, EVILBUU.  I will try to suggest moves, answer your questions as I see them.  I am going to talk about moves as they come, so if there is a better move at a location I will point it out.  My comments will be marked by "*:".

Mohit];W[gd];B[df];W[md];B[lc]C[Our apponent said that we should not live small on the edge. We should have played k14.

*: K14 is a good move, as it keeps white apart, but u got to know that white will most likely make a double approch.  Another idea here is Q14, letting white get part of top.  So you don't have to fight alot.]
;W[mc];B[hc];W[gc]
(;B[pf]C[*: this move is good idea, that is it threats to take space on the right side, but it doesn't put any pressure on white, and doesn't help your weak group.  So before you try making more space for your self, first fix you weakness so white can't attack it and make profit from it.]
;W[jf];B[hd];W[hf]
(;B[he]C[*: Not a good move.  It's like hitting a brick wall, so better to just hane.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[ee];B[de];W[gg];B[ff];W[ef]LB[de:3][ee:2][ef:6]
[ff:5][gf:1][gg:4]C[*: The sequence I marked is very bad for black, as it helps white get a wall that he uses to attack the corner.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[fh];W[dg];B[fe]C[We should have secured the corner insted of cutting.

*: Hmmm You can say that but ... then your stones at H17 come into trouble.  So not just simplying securing the croner but also helping your stonesat at H17 would be a better idea to think about.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[gb];B[fb];W[eb];B[ga];W[cl]C[*: Now if you look at it reall u only got about 15 points, where as white has gotten at least 20 points.  So this exchange favored white. Mind you white is trying to catch you on grander scale but, white still got the upper hand :P.]

(;B[ch]C[We were trying to cut the stone at c8 from the group on the e line. We failed. What would be a better way of doing that?

*: Cut off? They are not connected ^_^".  But to keep them apart ...  I recommend C10.  This move helps white.   And we don't want to do that ^_^"]
;W[cg];B[cn];W[dr];B[dq];W[er];B[gq]C[We considered the correct move c2 but thought that the middle of the board was more important.]
;W[bq]
(;B[cq]C[Yes. We know it's a weak, empty triangle.

*: Yes it is, but ... it is bad for other reasons here.  One of them being it is against your orginal thinking.  You said center is more important, but now you are giving corner more important? choose one not both ^_^']
;W[cr];B[bp];W[fq];B[gp];W[fp];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[ho]
(;B[hp]C[Yes. We know it's a weak, empty triangle.

*: Sadly it is .. the shape move here is J4,  Look at other path.]
;W[gr];B[iq]C[This is a mistake we thought about j4 or j5 but wanted to close off the edge.

*: Why close of something thats alive? It's pretty small to try attack something that is alive.]

;W[bj]
(;B[bi]C[We looked at c11 or b12 trying to keep these groups apart  and it didn't work look like it worked so we played this move in desporation.

*: C11? Doesn't work?  I think you must have misread, please look at the other path.  I tried two verations, and white dies in both of them.]

;W[hm]
(;B[mq]C[*: Did you misread? White is dead there so dont' stop attacking it ^^" just fix your weakness at H13 and attack white ^_^  I tried quite few verations, but all ended with same result as in example.]

C[*: Well thats all there is.  I Hope some of my comments helpped you.  In general your play was good.  But few pointers for future:

1) Onces you made up your mind on what u want to take, take that don't change mind mid way, like with C3.

2) When you attack, don't attack from strong to weak, attack from weak to strong, make the oppent go to ur strong position while you inforce your weak position.

3) When you are attacking a weak group dont' give you easily, fix your weakness and come back to attack, don't leave your weakness alone for too long or it will come bite you.  Or how some pro's say it .. if you take a lone you have to pay it back.  

4) Don't get caught in a sequence like E15 one at start of game, the lost was very big for black.

5) Don't give up on groups like C5, right away when there is weakness try to find the tesuji or hidden move that will help you save your group while threating to kill white's.

If you have any questions please catch on kgs (EvilBuu), or email me.  Thanks!]
