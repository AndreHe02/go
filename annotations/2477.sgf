C[I am mainly concerned about the opening and endgame so you don't need to waste too much time on the endgame though if you see any obvious mistakes let me know.

Hi, I'm Tero, a finnish 4 kyu. Hope my comments help!];B[pp]
;W[dd]C[I (Struggle-white) find that many of my games end up with me killing a large group or letting a group escape and not making enough territory.  I prefer games with lots of fighting--any opening suggestions for having such games?  Or any Pro's games I can study who enjoy a similar style?  Or should I adopt a different way to play?

Any general advice would be very helpful although specific variations are good too.

Tero: I think you might enjoy Sakata Eio's games. Fighting is my prefered style also.]
;B[cp];W[qd]C[I normally play on the 4-4 point here.  I still experiment a lot with fuseki.

Tero: This is ok, though I like to play ni-ren-sei as white, if black seems to be building a chinese opening.]
;B[ip];W[qn];B[on];W[qk];B[cf]
(;W[df]C[Tero: I think F16 would be normal for even games. This attach-and-extend joseki is perhaps more suitable for handycap games, or situations resembling handycap.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[cd]
(;W[cg]C[Perhaps c17 or c15 instead of c13?

Tero: Yes, this seems too greedy. C15 and C17 both ok. See variations for possible continuations.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[ch];B[dc];W[eh];B[ed]
(;W[cn]C[Seems like Black comes ahead here

Tero: Yes, white has nasty peeps remaining at F13 and D11 for later use, and black has sizeble corner with access to the top side. Also without the C12 group being weak white may have liked the E4 variations better.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[ge];W[jc]C[Tero: This move is a bit vague. It does not extend correctly from the top right corner, nor does it attack the white group, which is too strong to be attacked anyway.]
;B[oc];W[mc]C[Tero: This seems like a reasonable move to provide life to the K17 stone.]
;B[qc];W[od]C[Perhaps Q16 instead of P16?

Tero: This is playable. Q16 feels slow.];B[pd];W[pe];B[pc];W[oe]
C[Tero: Maybe R15 would be better here. White would have a nice moyo on the right side, and the top stones are not in danger. Letting black take R16 gives black too strong position, and access to the right side.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[rd];W[qq]C[Tero: maybe still close the right side with S14.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[ep];W[gc]
C[I believe my opponent should have connected at F16 here.

Tero: In my oppinion no reason, J15 provides access to the center and top. I would have played as in the variation on move 55 (as black). 
I think that white should have played K15 here to build a nice moyo.]
;B[ie];W[fd];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]
(;B[gd]C[Tero: This is a mistake from black. See variation.]
;W[fc];B[jd];W[hd];B[id];W[kc];B[jh];W[gf];B[he];W[ig]C[Tero: I like to attack so that I build something while attacking, this move does not really build anything, should the attack fail.]

(;B[il]C[Tero: Here black should play O12 or O13 to live for sure. See variations.]
;W[mi];B[nd];W[nc];B[of];W[mg];B[ld];W[md];B[ne];W[me]C[Tero: Yes, I can not fint a way to save the P15 stones and kill black.]
;B[pf];W[lf];B[en];W[kn]C[Perhaps C8 instead? or L3?

Tero: C8 ok, but gote, L3 also ok. This is a bit vague. You aim to reduce the black area, but end up making it stronger, with only little reduction. Also during this fight black manages to get some influence towards the left side.]
;B[lo];W[in];B[hm];W[im];B[gl];W[kl];B[cl]C[h11 here?

Tero: I think that taking those J12 stones in gote would be too small at this point. S12 would be bigger, but it is also gote. How about K4? See a possible continuation.]

Tero: Yes, it is better than this.];B[ri];W[qi];B[rj];W[qj]

(;W[ei]C[Tero: This is a mistake. Since you made the throw-in at J11, you should now take some advantage from black's bad shape. See variation.]
;B[ej];W[qr]C[Tero: Since pushing at Q1 is gote, Ithink it would be better for you to take Q2 now. It is also gote, but it is a bit bigger and leaves you with a new opportunity push at P1.]
;B[pr];W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[nb]
(;W[lc]C[Tero: Too defensive, you can block at N18 with no worries. It would give you sente to play something like N6.]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[mm];W[mn];B[mo]C[Tero: Black should have taken M6 here.]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[nm];B[oh];W[jl]C[Tero: Still J9 would have been better for you.]

;B[hl];W[nf]C[Tero: This feels wrong. There is no need to connect N15 and N13 like this. Also this makes only one point in gote. If you fell that you must connect, then play at O13 first, and threaten to cut O11 stones away.]

[as][bs][cs][ds][ls][ms][ns]C[Tero: I think your biggest (single) mistake was trying to save C6 after it was bagged. You could have used the aji in that stone to get some points at the tenth line or so. Now you just made black strong against your flawed position around the D13 stone. Black made nicely use of that to disroy your potential and did manage to build a few points for himself.
At the general level you allowed black to make strong shapes in the begining, which made it possible for black to fight without fears.]
