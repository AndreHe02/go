C[I lost the game because I handled poorly the middle game (that is my
impression).
I would like a focus on this part from the reviewer (provided it was the
actual problem in my playing).

Thanks in advance.

C[W O17 is bad move to me.

Proper move is A or B to split the moyo of black.];B[nd]LB[kc:D]
[pb:B][pf:A][qc:C][qj:E]C[Black should play the sequence A to E to get a nice moyo on the right.

This is why W O17 is bad.];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[mf]MA[mf]
LB[le:A]C[Bad move by white, gave black a peep at A.

After exchanging black A with white N15, the marked stone actually created a empty triangle which is bad shape.]
;B[pj]LB[le:A][me:B][pf:C]C[Black should play A (white B) then black C.]
;W[pf]MA[pj]C[It is always bad to get surrounded like this, even though the corner can be easily alive.

This wall of white will exert an influence on the right, weakening the marked black stone.]
;B[qg];W[qf]MA[qf][qg]C[This form of exchange is always bad, unless black further re-inforce with S13...

Let's reverse the sequence, if white play R14 (which is rather inefficient but let's assume white play here), will black play R13?

Never attach to the wall, just assume that a wall has an external influence or radiation of certain kind, stay away from it.]
;B[mc]C[Good move.];W[lc];B[nb];W[jp];B[cj];W[cm];B[cg];W[kd]
LB[mb:A][nc:B]C[White can consider to exchange A with B then play L16.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[cc];W[ed];B[cd]LB[be:A][bf:C][cf:B][ch:E][dg:D]
C[Black A better I think, it's the usual shape here.

Black C15 gave away, white B to E usage.];W[eg]LB[lq:A][mq:B]
C[Black to play A or white to play B, this is biggest point.]
;B[jj]TR[cj][pj]LB[ja:E][jb:G][ka:D][kb:C][la:F][lb:B][lq:A]
C[I wanted to do something about top side.
I thought C10 / Q10 allowed for K10

Even if white K10, it's not a big deal, the territory is still not complete.

Black A is better than K10.

The upper white side is not as big as it may look, if black reduce by the sente yose B to G...]
;W[jg]LB[mq:A]C[Slow move, white A is huge.];B[jc]LB[hf:B][hh:A]
[ja:F][jb:H][ka:E][kb:D][la:G][lb:C]C[Bad move, almost like suicide to me.

Just reduce will do, black A to exchange with white B then take the sente yose C to H...

When you see almost completed moyo, think of reducing it, try not to invade.]
;W[lb]
(;B[gf]C[thought of the variation, but I did not think it would work

You are just putting another dead stone inside...];W[hd]MA[gf]
LB[bf:B][bg:F][bh:D][cf:A][ch:C][dg:E][gh:G]C[White can just exchange A/B then C/D then  E/F, then swallow up the marked stone using G.]
;B[gh];W[ii]LB[bf:B][cf:A]C[A/B exchange is important for white.]
;B[ef]MA[ef][ii]C[White actually lost points for the exchange (J11 with E13), if white want to cut here, he should exchange C14 with B14 first.]
;W[nj]LB[mq:A][nk:B]C[Point A is huge, O10 got no substance.

Actually, black can take advantage of white's thought that center is big, attach at B, expand the side to the maximum...]
;B[pm]MA[jj]LB[lp:A][nk:B]C[At this time, I thougt I was ahead.

Still black A is huge, or B to maximize the right, Q7 too conservative.]
;W[ri]LB[eq:B][mq:A]C[This is end-game move, A or B is much bigger.]
;B[qi]LB[cn:F][co:E][cp:C][cq:A][cr:I][do:D][dq:B][dr:G][er:H]
[fq:J][lq:K]C[Black can actually ignore white S11, snatch the corner using A to J and then play K...]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[ok]LB[eq:B][mq:A]C[White should ignore black R9, play at A or B both huge.]
;B[lq];W[lo];B[ir]LB[cq:B][jr:A]C[Black A or B better, why ask to be splited?]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[jq];W[ip];B[kq];W[fq];B[fr]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb]LB[fi:B][fj:D][fk:E][gi:A][gj:C]C[White can consider A to E, seal up the gap here.]
;W[eq];B[ek]LB[hj:A]C[Black A a better point to enter the center if you want to.]
;W[hk];B[mn];W[mo];B[nm]LB[mk:B][no:A]C[P6 better ?

Maybe you are right.];W[oo];B[po];W[lm]MA[mn]LB[ml:A]C[Black A a simple and effective move.

The marked black stone can be sacrifice...];B[ln];W[kn];B[km]
;W[ll];B[ko];W[jn];B[kp];W[pl]C[Great move! O6 and R8 are mirror moves now.]
;B[ql]C[I thought it was safer to play for the side, rather than for the two stones at N6]
;W[nn];B[oj];W[nl];B[om];W[mm];B[ni]C[I should have played S12

No, this is big too...];W[mi];B[mj];W[nk];B[mh];W[li];B[nh]
LB[cq:A][er:B]C[This is small... Black A is biggest now as compared to white B.]
;W[fm]LB[er:A][gl:B]C[here, I did not find the correct pattern to enter W middle.

This is bad... Corner (white A) is much bigger, just get what you should get in the middle.

Black can enter at B at later stage.];B[gk];W[gl];B[gj];W[hj]
LB[ih:A][jh:C][ji:B]C[White don't need this, nothing here.

If black A then white B. If black B then white C.];B[cq]C[I though there was something possible

Yes, but you make some mistakes later.];W[er];B[dr]LB[bl:C]
[bm:B][bo:A][cn:D]C[Black A better, simply alive.

Black got A to D or D2 next.];W[cp]LB[bp:B][br:A][cs:C]C[Black A to C alive.]
;B[bp];W[br]C[Sharp move by white.];B[co];W[bq];B[do]LB[dm:B]
[en:A]C[White can play A here, black should play B instead.]
;W[eo];B[dm];W[dl];B[cl]C[Nice cut.];W[dn]LB[bm:A][cn:C][em:B]
C[Black A to C can connect, still getting something here.];B[en]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[bn];B[dq];W[ep];B[dk];W[em];B[bl]LB[df:A]C[This move is not big to both sides.

Black should play A.];W[rg]LB[df:A][dg:B][ee:E][eh:F][ff:C]
[fg:D]C[White should play A to F then S13.];B[rj];W[qh];B[ph]

;B[gr];W[fs];B[jr]LB[hs:A]C[Black A better.   2 more points.]
;W[gs];B[hr];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[bb]LB[ab:A]C[Black A better, ensure of eye-shape.]
;W[ce]LB[ab:F][ac:D][ad:E][bd:C][be:B][bf:G][de:A]C[Black A to G, nothing here for white.]
;B[be];W[ff]C[This move can't work, lost 2 points actually.]
;B[fe];W[de]LB[cf:A]C[Black should play A];B[fg]C[that cost me a lot of points (not enough to win anyway). C14 was enough

Yes.];W[bf];B[ad];W[cf];B[bg];W[ag]
(;B[ac];W[bh];B[ch];W[bi];B[bj]LB[af:H][mb:A][op:C][pb:B][pp:D]
[si:G][sj:E][sk:F]C[White should play A to G.

Ko at H too heavy for black...   C11 is gote 1 point, smallest of all.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[ah];B[bm]LB[mb:A][op:C][pb:B][pp:D][si:G][sj:E]

;B[of]LB[ka:C][kb:E][la:B][ma:D][mb:A]C[Black A better, slightly more than 6 points (If black A, he gets to play B to E later).

P14 is dame (zero in point)...];W[oe];B[ng];W[og];B[nf];W[pe]
LB[mb:A]C[Again, white should play A.];B[ae];W[af];B[lh];W[ki]

(;B[pb];W[gm];B[ma];W[la];B[na]LB[hg:C][sh:A][sj:B]C[White should play A to C.

;B[qm]C[Overall, black did not do well in any stage (opening, middle or end-game), maybe you should go through the mistakes I pointed out.

Sincerely hope you learnt from your mistakes, improve and be a better player.
