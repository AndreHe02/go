CR[cd]LB[oc:A][od:B][ec:C][ed:D]C[patrickb: A few minor fuseki comments probably over your head right now, but I thought I'd mention them:

This a strange opening set, probably advantageous for b, for this reason:
1. The formation at the top is called "opposing komoku(3-4)". THe person who gets the first approach is thought to have an
advantage, though it's *not* a big advantage. For examples, pros still play opposing komoku now and then. This is slighly to B's advantage, since it is now b's move.

2. Ths points marked A and B are important for another reason. If B gets A or B, he can strongly pincer any approach at the bottom right.. So, B has lots of good choices here. A or B, or C or D are all good. I think I'd prefer C or D, personally, since w can't pincer happily, and this both takes the advantage in opposing komoku and prevents w from playing C/D and strongly pincering an approach to the bottom.]
;B[oc]CR[oc];W[ed]CR[ed];B[co]CR[co]LB[dk:A][ck:B]C[patrickb: this is a *perfect* place for a w pincer around A or B, because not only is it a pincer, it's an extension from the upper left corner.]
;W[do]CR[do]C[patrickb: This move only makes b stronger in an area where b should be kept weak with a pincer. Attachments are used to make both sides stronger. Here, in many of the standard variations (I show the standard attach-and-extend joseki), b gets a strong settled group in a way that makes w's upper left enclosure ineffective.]

CR[bq];B[aq]CR[aq];W[cr]CR[cr];B[br]CR[br]C[patrickb: Note that this ko is low risk for w, but if w cuts at B5 it is high risk for b. W can also make a useful extension from his wall around K4. Again, though, the direction of this wall is wrong, which is why the original attachment was a mistake.]

(;W[bs]CR[bs]LB[bo:A]C[patrickb: if you're going to fight the ko, cut at A instead.]
;B[cq]CR[cq];W[dr]CR[dr]
(;B[cf]CR[cf]C[patrickb: Too close to a secure w position, with too much space behind it.]
;W[ch]CR[ch];B[cj]CR[cj]LB[ef:A]C[babybaby: should B play at a (E14) first or where else that can safe both C14 and lower left group?

patrick: Really, C14 was the mistake. w is relatively strong in the upper left, and you played too close to a strong w position.
Holding back to C11 or C12 yourself would probably have been better. However, the black group at the bottom is *not* weak yet. Better to go ahead and run out at A now, I guess.]
;W[eh]CR[eh];B[ef]CR[ef];W[ej]CR[ej]LB[gf:A]C[patrickb: Note that the b stones at the top are still weak. W can potentially make *lots* of profit attacking them. Best to try and deal with them now. Just run out at A before you get encircled.]
;B[qh]CR[qh]LB[qk:A][pk:B]C[patrickb: For a move on this side, this is *much* too slow. b is very strong in the upper right, and has a stone at the lower right. On this side, A or B is better.]

;W[jc]CR[jc];B[lf]CR[lf]LB[qo:A]C[babybaby: I feel this black move didn't make a good shape but I have no idea where to play.

patrickb: This isn't a terrible move. It expands your right side while trying to lend a hand to the weak b group. Still, it doesn't help the weak b group that much, and note how w is spreading out on a grand scale while most of the b moves are  concentrated in particular areas of the board. W can still play at A to break up the right side.]

I think that I'm not good in making a good shape. how can I improve?

patrickb: There were serious opening issues that caused you lots of grief later, though you managed to save it with some clever moves in teh upper left, and a blunder or three on white's part. As far as the opening is concerned, try to remember which direction various corner stones and corner enclosures favor, and be willing to pincer, or take advantage of w's mistakes of failing to pincer.  Really, a lot of your early troubles were caused by creating a weak group when you played too close to a strong w position.

A very important go proverb is: "Don't play too close to thinkness."

As far as the rest of the game, I'd just suggest looking at problems, such as "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, volume 2", and "Tesuji", by James Davies.
