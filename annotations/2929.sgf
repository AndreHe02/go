C[Well good day, I will be your reviewer for today, any time you see a  R>  it's me :)

Rogerio Luz];B[pd]C[I am black (ticktock on KGS).   I'm going to make some guesses about bad moves I made during the game, but sometimes I'm wrong about guessing where I went wrong.   [Calvin\]]

(;B[pg]LB[pc:A]TR[pn][qn][po]C[It might be better for me to separate at A.   I'm mainly thinking about attacking white's three marked stones.

R> If your intention is attacking the the 3 stones I think the separation should be at R16... (See variation) because white still has a good move at R9 or R10 to try to settle his group.]
;W[qd]C[R> R10 is still better];B[qg];W[pf];B[of];W[pc]
(;B[nh]C[This is gote., and may be a little slow.

R> Sure is! I don't see why you think you need to defend yet, but R8 comes to mind, S14 is better locally , but I think the tenuki at C14 could be best.]
;W[go]
(;B[mp]C[See variation for another sequence I considered.];W[hp]
;B[mn]LB[hr:A]C[It would seem passive for me to try to save this stone with A.]
;W[ci];B[fc]LB[rn:A]TR[nc][pc]C[It looked big to play here, but I missed the fact that white can play at A in sente.   In fact, this is not so big because white is strong and low in the upper right.  This side is therefore "uninteresting."]
;W[hc];B[fe]LB[cc:A]TR[hc][ci]C[Invading at A might be better.  No matter which way white blocks one of the two marked stones would be too close to his thickness.]
;W[df];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[mc];B[cq]
C[This invasion is not so big.

R> You are right, especially if the Q6 stones live, but it is sente.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[R> Since you managed to make so much aji in this corner (with the threat to live C3 and/or connect F3 with K4 I would think much on R8 and killing Q6, besides the center is much more yours than white's.]
;B[bo];W[cp];B[bp];W[qk];B[pk]LB[qj:A]C[This block may be on the wrong side.  It's hard for me to say.  I can't kill this group, and I don't know whether sealing it in is bigger than tormenting it more.

R> Well I wouldn't say you CAN'T kill the group, but it is nastier, A is to kill Q9 is "ok you live, but let me get all the midle" the question is if the midle is big enough ;).]
;W[qj];B[qi]LB[rn:A]TR[pg][qg][nh][pj][pk]C[Instinct to hane at the head of two stones, but now black is overconcentrated.   It would probably be better for me to play at A, and remove white's sente move there.

R> Still don't think A is sente... S3 can't possibly wish on living after A .]
;W[rn];B[rq]C[I said earlier that I assumed this W56 was sente, but now that I look at it, it probably not necessary for black to protect here.

R> Nope not necessary and you missed the excelent S11 to make him a harder time than what he had before S6.]
;W[pi];B[ql];W[ri];B[rk];W[rj];B[pl];W[rl];B[dj]LB[qh:A]C[I wasn't sure white would answer if I just connected at A, so I took sente to make this reduction.   Maybe not too bright, but I don't know if it's a bad idea.

R> Well S7 is still sente and kills Q6, so I would try first there, but maybe you have a point on the D10 stone, it is very interesting indeed, but I suspect E11 was a better move to check white now.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm]C[This is bad.  It's just pushing on a link.  I do plan to cut, but the cut is useless.

R> This is great for you!!!!! look at that marvelous wall he let you build twords the midle!!! he gave away the game with this exchange!!! The cut is useless but how about J7 or the likes now?]
;W[cm];B[cn]C[I have to cut now otherwise the previous pushing is meaningless.  However, the cut itself doesn't threaten white now, so this whole sequence is bad.]
;W[co];B[en];W[bn];B[gk];W[eh]LB[ar:A]TR[bn]C[I got lucky here.   After the marked stone is played, I think black really needs to protect the corner.

R>Yes ;)];B[ar]C[I catch it before it's too late.   However, the whole pushing sequence ends in gote now, and I don't think the exchange is good for blac

R> if you had E12 the game was won ;)];W[rg];B[oi];W[rm];B[db]
C[I don't see any weak groups on the board so I begin decide to begin yose.  I think this is the biggest point.

R> I think you are wrong... J7 seems the biggest point for you now.]
;W[cc]C[R> This leaves a cut.];B[gi]C[R> G11 is not so good. G12 looks slightly better.]
;W[ec]C[R> There it is];B[fb];W[fd];B[gd];W[ed];B[gc];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[gf];B[iq]LB[lc:A]C[There's something to the push at A, but I couldn't read it out during the game, so I continued with more normal moves.  I figure maybe white will get scared and connect in gote.  This is wishful thinking.]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[jh];W[hm]C[R> There it is... with this invasion there is no more time for black.]
;B[il];W[im];B[ia]C[A terrible sequence follows for black.]
;W[ib];B[ka]LB[ha:A][lc:B]C[The normal continuation of the monkey jumps calls for black to play at A.  However, because of the hole at B, I thought I could be smarter than that.  I was wrong.]
;W[ha];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb]
(;B[ga]LB[jb:A]C[I big miss.  Black can create a ko to capture by starting at A.

R> actually its a ko];W[ja]C[Serves me right for trying to be too smart.]

C[This doesn't work.   Black might just connect at A instead, a known big point.]

;B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rf];B[lm];W[ml];B[kj]LB[lk:A]C[I think A is better shape now.]
;W[mj];B[ig]LB[mi:A]C[This is a terrible move, because it doesn't threaten much.  I think black has to block white's incursion at A, even if it's gote.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[li];B[lj]C[Hideous.   I thought I had removed such moves from my games!  I guess not.]

;W[ij];B[hk];W[kf];B[lg];W[hg]C[I resign.  It's not a large loss, but I don't think there is anything else I can do.   White's endgame positions are too solid.

R> Well I can't see why you resigned, it's still a close game, but you should have won this one easily :).

I hope you get more feeling for the big picture since it seems you missed some great opportunities because of it
