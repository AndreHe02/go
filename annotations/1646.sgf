;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jp]LB[cj:B][cn:A]C[your next move is a little bit slow. 
I would call it a minor mistake.
w has already taken the best spot at the bottom.
Black should go for the other big points now. 
Pros play A+B in this position.]

This is the first really costy mistake by you in the game.]

[fd:B]C[this move doesn't do much. A+B looks much better. Even C is very big locally.
you may have been afraid that your F6 group could come under attack. 
But if you are too afraid of your groups you will miss to take the big points on the board.]

now w can reduce the upper right corner further and takes a solid lead on the board.]

(;B[ld]LB[lc:A]TR[nc][jd]C[this reducing move is not the best in presence of the marked white stones.
often the deep invasion at A works. But white is maybe too strong for it here.
On the other hand w is so much ahead that it is worth a try.]

and 40 in the top. plus a few for the other 2 groups. a total of
about 75 points
b has 25 in the lower right, 15 on the left and 10 in the right.
a total of 50 points.

black cannot hope to catchup 20+ points in the center even
with the help his thickness because his mojo is open to 
3 sides.  The game virtually  over here and my commentary stops
at this point.];B[oi];W[kg];B[mg];W[hh];B[ek];W[dk];B[dj];W[om]
