RE[W+12.5]

;B[dp]C[My
game, as always, seems to rely on my ability to invade opponents moyos.
I need help to move to a higher level of play, as this strategy
increasing proves to be unsuccessful against stronger players.  Thanks
for your assistance.

;W[pn];B[jp];W[fc]LB[cj:B][cn:A]C[Alternatively,
White can make moves like A (to invade the lower left Black's corner)
or B (to split the Black's moyo).];B[hc];W[cf];B[fd];W[cc];B[cd]
;W[bd]LB[bb:B][bc:D][cb:C][cn:E][dc:A][ql:F]C[I have seen pros playing A to D (Black A, White B, Black C and White D).

Black got Sente and play E (to defend the corner) or F (to attack White lower right corner).]
;B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[dc];B[ed]LB[fb:A][ia:B]C[You can consider White A too. 

With a possibility of play White B later, Black will have little incentive to develop the top side.]
;W[ec];B[gd]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[A slow move (playing Black G17 is locally better), Black should consider creating a moyo at A or B.]
;W[bf]MA[cf]LB[ch:C][ck:A][cn:B]C[
Rather a heavy move (burden at later stage of the game), you should
treat the marked White stone more like a dead stone as it's attached
closely to a Black wall.

White should consider playing at A instead, you have 2 good moves at B or C later (Miai in Japanese).]
;B[ad]LB[ae:A]C[Personally I prefer to play Black A instead of A16.]
;W[af]C[White should try not to play this move, you reserve the right to play A17 later.]
;B[ae];W[ac]C[Now, White is in Gote, this is bad.];B[di]C[Good move.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[df];B[gg]C[Good move again.];W[gf];B[hf];W[fg]
;B[gh];W[dh];B[eh];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi]MA[bf]LB[ah:E][ck:F]
[eg:C][ei:D][fh:A][fi:B]C[White should play A to E to settle down.

However,
to stay alive (getting 5 points) and be surrounded by a thick Black
wall, it's considered to be a worst than being dead.

This is why I emphasize on the idea of White F earlier on, rather than playing B14 (the marked stone) which is "heavy".]
;W[eg];B[fh]C[White lost 2 points without exchanging F12/ F11.]
;W[cg]LB[ah:A][ai:B][aj:F][ak:D][al:E][bj:H][bk:C][bl:G][cj:I]
C[White C13, lost 1 point on territory (instead of 5 points if you play at A, now you get only 4 points).

Another
5 points is lost for the chance later to play B to I, if there is a
stone at A (with no stone at A, you can play only B, F, A, H). 

So C13 lost 6 points in total, which is almost the Komi.];B[ge]
LB[dn:A]C[A rather unnecessary or slow move. 

Black A will complete the moyo here.];W[cn]LB[co:B][dn:C][fo:D]
[ho:A]C[Personally, I will invade at A. White C6 too risky to me.

Black can attack at B, White C then Black D...];B[en]LB[bo:F]
[bp:E][bq:G][co:H][cp:B][cq:A][dq:C][ep:D][fq:I]C[A
rather merciful move to me, White can play A to I and snatch the
Black's lower left corner comfortably.];W[bp]LB[cq:A]C[Bad move, entering the corner at A is simpler.]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[bm]C[Good move.];W[cr];B[dr];W[cp];B[dq];W[br]
;B[cm]LB[bn:A][dm:C][dn:B][do:D][eo:E]C[White should play A, simply alive with about 8 points.

You can always play B to E later.];W[dn];B[dm];W[em];B[fn];W[do]
;B[eo];W[bn];B[gp]MA[em]LB[ek:E][el:C][fk:F][fl:D][fm:A][ql:B]
C[Again, another slow move. 

Black should play A (to stay clear of any trouble) or B to attack the lower right corner aggressively.

With Black A, the marked White stone is dead, White C then Black D, White E then Black F.]
;W[el]LB[bk:C][ck:B][gk:D][gl:A][hk:E]C[This
White move can't really work, Black A kills all (if White B then Black
C or if White D then Black E, no way out here).];B[dk]C[Weak move by Black.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk];W[ek]LB[hk:A]C[Wrong timing to exchange White E9 with Black D10.

Black A will kill White's group, responding at Black D10 is not necessary at all.]
;B[dj];W[hl];B[jl];W[im]LB[kn:A]C[Black should play A to block the path of White.]
;B[hk];W[gk];B[il];W[gm]MA[gk][gm][hk][il]C[The last 2 black moves are helping moves, helping White to build eye-shape.]
;B[hn];W[hm];B[hj];W[in]LB[kn:A]C[What if Black A?

I don't think White can survive here.

White should play K7 to have a chance of escaping...];B[ho]
C[Slow move by Black.];W[kn];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[mn]C[Black is far too merciful, contented with getting the lower side.]
;B[nd];W[pf];B[nf]C[Good move, developing the Moyo.];W[pc];B[ob]
LB[mg:A]C[Q18 is end-game move or Yose, still not crucial now.

White to play A to invade the Moyo before it's too late.];W[pb]
;B[oc]LB[ni:A]C[Again, this is Yose.

Black should play A, now the center is bigger than the side...]
;W[pq]LB[ml:E][ni:A][nk:C][pi:B][pk:D]C[Corner is not as big as center now, in term of the potential...

Still, White A is crucial, White has to limit the potential of Black's Moyo, then play the Yose.

Imagine if Black play A to E, giving away the points at the right side, in exchange for the center.

Let's count and judge... 

White (top left: 11, bottom left: 8, right side: 57 points, Komi: 6.5, total: 82.5 points)
Black (lower side: 28 points, left side: 8 points, center: 60 points, total: 96 points)

Black ahead by 13.5 points, this prove my point is correct, center is indeed bigger than side now in this situation.]
;B[qj];W[qh]LB[nn:B][ql:A]C[Wrong
direction, with some Aji at B, White should play A (to protect the
corner and the weakness at B).];B[rm];W[rn];B[qm];W[qn];B[ph]
;W[qi]LB[pi:B][qg:A]C[White
should consider playing just A or B (Black cut at R11 then White A),
ladder at P11 is in favour of White.];B[pi];W[pg];B[oj]LB[pj:A]
C[Black A better, simpler and cleaner way to defend the cut at A.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[pm]LB[mk:A]C[White A to reduce the center, is more crucial now.]
;B[qk]LB[mk:A]C[Black should play A to complete the Moyo.];W[ng]
LB[lf:G][me:E][mf:B][mg:A][ne:D][nh:C][of:F]C[Black should play A and win the game.

If
White play B in vain to complicate the situation, Black can play C, if
White D then Black E, White F again, then Black G to stop.

It may be a big Ko if Black cut at M13 or M15, however White got no good threats.

Black can ignore White B8 threat and win the Ko.];B[og];W[of]
;B[oh];W[ne];B[mf];W[me]C[This is really bad for Black.];B[md]
;W[le];B[ld];W[ke];B[lg];W[kd];B[kc];W[jc];B[kb];W[jb]C[Black can cut at K16, this White move is unreasonable.]
;B[jd];W[ma];B[mb];W[oa];B[la];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[ki]
;B[je];W[kf];B[qg]C[Nice cut, White can't play S13 because of cut at P15.]

;W[jq];B[jo];W[km];B[kq]C[Poor exchanges by White, lost about 3 points here.]
;W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[iq]C[Wrong move, Black N2 takes all, obviously White can't make 2 eyes here.]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[nr]C[At this point, White won the game, I will not comment further.

I hope you enjoy this review.
