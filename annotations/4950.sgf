C[Hello dear reviewer!

I'm playing W in this game.
I have some fuseki questions but my biggest worry is moves 24 to 29.
Those are the key moves for me in this game, B splitting me in two weak positions.
This has dragged me down during the whole game leading to a big loss.
Another key moment in the game is move 90.
So any tips or insights would be more than welcome!

Thanks and have fun!

Frdric aka Buitenland on KGS

PS I've preceded my comments & questions with "B:".

Jewdan: Hi! It's been a while since I've done a review, but I'll do my best. My comments will be proceeded by my monniker, "Jewdan."

I feel that there is a lot to be learned from this game. Both sides made mistakes (some subtle, others glaring), and both sides had a fair bit of insight as well. So, I will try to review how both sides did and then explain how it can help you.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pj]C[Jewdan: This move feels a little odd to me. If the R16 stone were on the hoshi (Q16), this move would normally be played at Q9. R16 is still on the fourth line in reference to this point, so the typical move is still the right one. This leaves the upper-right a little cramped and the lower-left too open.

A fun way to point this mistake out to your opponent is to approach at Q6 before he can form his shimari at Q5 or R5... you have enough room to make a base, but Black cannot do anything without cramping himself or attaching to you (which is always bad for an attack). However, Q5 is probably a better shimari, since even the ikken takabasami at Q7 cannot kill it or profit much from the attack.

Beyond this, there is a problem with this position in that Black's komoku is lined up with White's hoshi on the top. This position is terrible, since any approach White makes (P17, P16, O16, or any other kakari you can think of) is directly supported by the upper-left hoshi while sitting on the komoku's weak point. I believe that Black should have taken the shimari at P17 to cover for this. Yes, White can make a san-ren-sei by playing at D10 (three hoshi plays by the same player that are lined up) or even approach the Q3 komoku, but Black has no flaws left in his shape and is taking territory (the emphasis of the komoku play).

This means that, in these five moves, Black has already exposed two flaws to White. White has none, and is in a position to take the lead in the fuseki.

See the variation on White's next move.]
(;W[cj]C[B: What about W C10 compared with W D10?

Jewdan: D10 is the better move. However, to explain that, I need to explain the concept of direction of play.

Moves have optimal follow-ups. For example, a komoku (the 3-4 point, such as R16) just feels unbalanced without a stone at a point like P17 or P16 to form a shimari. Neither of these points is necessarily better than the other, but both can be thought of comind out from the komoku stone in the same direction. This is the direction of play; since each move is only as good as its follow up, moves "desire" specific kinds of follow-ups to maximize their potentials.

When it comes to the hoshi , the general direction of play is along the sides as far as is possible. When two hoshi of the same color are on the same side, the two stones share the same direction of play. This naturally leaves C10 and D10 as the two choices, which it is easy for a player to conclude as being equivalent.

However, I disagree with that conclusion. Part of direction of play is fulfilling the desire or intent of the original stone. The intent of the hoshi is to build influence on the outside, forsaking early territorial pursuit. And when you have two stones, both desirous of influence and both sharing the same direction of play, the only move that can possibly fulfill their desire is to play another influence-seeking move.

The result is the powerful opening position known as the san-ren-sei. On the outsides, you have two hoshi of the same color, each with a hoshi (the one in the middle) in their direction of play working for the same goal as they are. In the middle, you have the one hoshi with both of its directions of play already settled with stones working for the same goal of influence. This makes the side a terrifying source of power for White throughout the game, as all the stones are resonating with the same purpose.

Despite having said all that, I feel the best direction of play right now is not on the side where you help both of your stones, but in the upper-right, where you can meet your direction of play while depriving your opponent of his. See the variation on this move to see how this might turn out.

For a solid explanation on the concept of the direction of play, get a copy of _The Direction of Play_ by Takeo Kajiwara 9p. It is an excellent book that can completely transform they way you think about Go.]
;B[oc]C[Jewdan: Nuts. One of Black's weaknesses is gone, and now White has a dissatisfactory move as well. On top of this, Black already has a stone on his shimari's direction of play (extending from the original komoku), so he is threatening taking away D16's direction of play while fulfilling the upper-right's next one by making a double-wing extension.

With this play, the chances of winning the board represented have shifted to Black.]
;W[jc]C[B: Which is better K17 or K16?

Jewdan: It is hard to say. D16 wants influence, and the move to help that happen is K16. However, P17 wants a base for a moyo, and the move to prevent that is K17.

Even though it does not help D16 as much as the other move should, K17 cannot be slid beneath, thus allowing Black more territory, and Black's capping it does not truly help Black much, so I would pick K17 as you did.]
;B[jp];W[hp]C[Jewdan: I do not pretend to be a pro, but I have read many professional commentaries in which pros will deride a move based upon how it feels. Likewise, I do not like the feel of this move: it is reactionary, somewhat desperate, too close to D4... there is no specific theory to which I can point to explain this intuition, but I feel that, since Black took what you want, it is better to take what Black wants as opposed to scrabbling for what he hasn't stolen.

For example, if Black responds by taking what he wants at Q5, the threat of pincering K4 diminishes because of the strong formation behind it. That play would set you solidly behind, as you have lost your chance to strike at the two weaknesses Black had while losing two opportunities to meet your stones' directions of play.]
;B[iq]
(;W[hq]C[Jewdan: See the variation on this move for an explanation as to why the only moves right now are in the lower-right corner.]
;B[lc]C[Jewdan: >_< Lower-right!]
(;W[je]C[Jewdan: This, or possibly L15, is the second-largest move on the board. The lower-right is still the most important spot.]
;B[dg]C[B: First invason..the middle game starts.

Jewdan: Black had no choice but to try to prevent E10 from creating two moyos, but he picked the wrong move to do it. He should play the reduction at E10 himself.

You, however, do not have to respond. Ignore it for now and play in the lower-right. If he does not respond to you there and tries something in the upper-left, you can easily respond to whatever he tries in that region without suffering any real losses and likely end it in sente. In that situation, that means you get another move in his corner, and then his position is ravaged. Black likely cannot afford that, and will respond. However, it is easy to make sabaki (settled shape) in sente, and return to the upper-left.

See the variation on White's next move for an example exchange.]

(;W[ei]TR[cl][dl][cm][dm][cn][dn]C[B: Not too sure about E11. I wanted to pince D13 and protect the marked area.

Jewdan: A fine ambition, but protective moves are closer to the regions rather than further away. What I mean is that this move leans toward D13 and away from the marked area... it is a fine aggressive move and a poor defensive move. Likewise, E9 would be a great defensive move and a poor offensive move.

I believe that the best local move is E10: it forms a solid wall that is not easily cut, exerting equal pressure towards the top and bottom. However, see the variation on this move to see what I believe to be the best move.]
;B[fg]TR[cc][fc][fd][gd][ig]C[B: black escapes easily and threats marked area.

Jewdan: Escapes? He was never really trapped, and your move left him no choice but to run.]
;W[fd]LB[dg:A][ei:B][fg:C][fd:D][ej:E]C[Jewdan: This is a good example of an induced sequence. With 'A' in the region, White would like a stone at 'D', but doing directly is gote. 'B' (or 'E' as well) puts pressure on 'A', forcing Black to run to 'C', which forces 'D'. However, this continues the pressure on 'A' and 'C', and thus is now sente. This is good play.]
;B[hg];W[ce]C[B: W protects the corner

Jewdan: Not really. Black can invade. See the variation on Black's next move. Note, however, that now is not the time for Black to try this yet.

Here, the rule to follow is the duality "Force your opponent to live on the inside / Never allow yourself to be forced to live on the inside." When you live on the inside when you could have run, the result is that the opponent gets beautiful thickness on the outside while he clamps you inside. Here, you have the chance to expand your moyo in the lower-left and continue your attack on Black's weak line by playing G11. It is proper for Black to continue running, but if he tries to live inside by jumping into the corner, let him; he is trapping himself by aiming for small fries when there are sharks to be caught.]

(;B[gi]TR[dl][el][dm][em][cn][hn]C[B: I think Black threats this area

Jewdan: Doesn't WG11 look a lot better than WC15 now?

This move shows why E11 is inferior to E10 or E9 in defending the lower-left moyo. It is more difficult more Black to get to and cap either of those moves as he has with this move. Whereas E10 would be a solid position even if capped, E11 has the feeling of being surrounded.]
;W[gk]C[Jewdan: This move is not good. It neither adequately defends the moyo because of the gap at F10, nor does it put pressure on Black's group at all. If Black left, how would you continue the attack? Black can play Q5 now and be content with his position.

F9 is probably the best move, though G10 makes for an interesting fight (though it violates the rule of not attaching to that which you want to attack).]
;B[hj]LB[cc:A][cq:B][ec:C][gc:D]C[B: Considering the wole board position, B has a huge territory on the right side and a dent in W territory. (CGoban Score: B +45)
My positions (W) on the left top and on the left bottom are quite strong.
B's moyo seems weaker. Strong positon at the right top, but right side seems quite weak.

Jewdan: This position is hard to count, and I will agree that currently Black seems territorially ahead, but Black does have the weak group in the upper-left quadrant of the board and the openings in his lower-right corner against him. The game is not lost yet.

However, your positions are not strong. Black can invade in either of your san-sans (3-3 points, 'A' and 'B'), possibly peep at E17 ('B'), or strike the shoulder (or perhaps the buttock, since it's lower on the board?) of F16 at G17 ('D').

I'm sure you've heard many of the nasty names for Kiseido's Score Estimator... my favorite is Score Obliterator. Don't trust it too readily. I highly doubt that the gap between the two sides is more than 20 moku.]

(;W[pm]CR[jg][hk][jn][po][qo]C[B: Is this a good move? What are other possible moves? R5, Q5, k13, k6,H9?
What would be the most efficient way to reduce B's moyo?

Jewdan: This move allows R5, which actually allows Black more territory than his current formation should permit. My favorite move in this situation is Q5, as it can live even if pincered (as demonstrated in the variation earlier). However, I am not certain this is the best move... this is a fairly tough situation, and playing in here at all eliminates possibilities on the upper portion of the side. Fortunately, the upper side has the standard anti-shimari aji at P15 and even S16, so playing here on the bottom before it can be secured seems best.]
;B[qo]C[B: How should I respond to this? What are the possibilities?]

(;W[np]C[Jewdan: This move is too easily cut from O7. It's a set-up for a splitting attack. P5 is probably the best move here.]
;B[mq]C[Jewdan: Black can and should split at P6 now. His J3 and K4 stones can run to his group in the center of the board while helping the harassment of White's group formed by O4 and causing Q7 to die a natural death.]

(;W[nq]C[Jewdan: This is heavy, meaning that it is a group of too many stones in one location not accomplishing what fewer stones while being under attack. Drawing back is the only option; pushing down like this only makes the attack hurt worse.]
;B[on]CR[qj][mo]SQ[pm][np][nq]C[B: For me the key move of this game, I have the impression I lost my game here.
Q10 and O4 are split now in two weak positions.
I've been struggling very badly with those two weak groups during he whole game.

Jewdan: I'm not completely sure the game is over, but the outcome of this fight determines whether you have a fighting chance or should resign. This particular situation is a nasty one where you have to pick which group lives and which one dies, as the natural flow of fleeing with one will surround and kill the other.

The difficulty of this situation is determining which group to save. If you save the lower group, the group will be harassed across the center of the board and help Black wall off the right side and probably some more besides. If you attempt to save the higher stone, you might end up with some central influence to counteract Black's upper-right area, but Black will certainly end up with a very large bottom.

I would probably try to save the Q7 stone because the potential in the upper-right feels larger than the bottom to me, but I can't count it...]

(;W[lo]C[Jewdan: It's interesting to sacrifice the two stones, but you aren't helping Q7, either... this should be treated as a last ditch effort to kill something to catch up.]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[nr];W[lr];B[mr];W[jr]
C[Jewdan: You connected in the wrong place... L4 is the spot. Even if Black takes M2, J3 and K4 are still in serious trouble.]
;B[kp];W[or];B[oq];W[ir];B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[lm];B[jn];W[ml]
C[Jewdan: This move costs you by allowing him to take territory from a higher line. M8 is a better move.]

;W[jm];B[in]
(;W[im]C[Jewdan: The variation on this move works, but so should this one.]
;B[hm];W[hl];B[gm]
(;W[cm]C[Jewdan: An interesting and slightly insulting move. You believe that Black cannot live, and you show Black that with this move. Originally, I wanted to correct you for this move, but the more I look at it, the more _I_ feel corrected. This move is solidly defensive and offensive simultaneously and metaphorically slaps your opponent across the face by saying, "I can win with safe moves."

I spent over an hour on a variation on what I would have played here (a move I feel is less risky), and I will keep it in this review, but I cannot say my move is better than yours - if you know how to follow it up.

See the variation on this move for my idea.];B[ho];W[eq]C[Jewdan: You truly are certain that he cannot live! Another certain, solid move. After this move, however, there is no room for mistakes, for you have freely given him his first eye.]
;B[go];W[ko]LB[ip:A][io:B]C[B: wasted move

Jewdan: Move 29 is not the losing move; this move is. To borrow a line from the computer game _The Time Warp of Dr. Brain_, "You've got the right idea... just the wrong execution."

Yes, you have to eliminate Black's eyes... but you can only eliminate eyes by hitting the right point. L5 is not a point necessary to make an eye at all... you found out the hard way that playing here allows him to live.

The point was J4 ('A'). Black would have to struggle for another eye in the space left to him and then eventually come back to connect at J5 ('B'), or else lose the eye he has.]
;B[jo];W[km];B[kk];W[jk]LB[il:A]C[Jewdan: Simple moves are often better than tricky ones (unless you know for certain how the future will proceed). I would play J8 ('A') to eliminate aji.]
;B[jj]LB[ip:A]C[Jewdan: ... What? Black needs J4 to live immediately. Now is your chance to undo your mistake from earlier.]
;W[fn]C[Jewdan: A good forcing move.];B[gn];W[fo]LB[ip:A][io:B]
C[Jewdan: If a game could have two losing moves, this would be the second one.

Your previous move should have been treated as a kikashi, a forcing move. These moves are large threats that are played as soon as they become the largest moves on the board... but then they are abandoned until continuing becomes the largest move.

Here, you have to follow up with J4 ('A'). Black can bend around F6 as he likes, but that stone will hurt his formation of another eye, and he has to worry about WJ5 ('B') removing the eye he has now.]
;B[ip]C[Jewdan: Black has lived; it is time to resign.];W[fm]
LB[fj:A]C[Jewdan: White needs to save his center group if he is going to continue the game... a move like F10 ('A') would be prudent.]
;B[gl];W[hk];B[fk];W[ij]
(;B[fj];W[ji];B[kj];W[ih];B[jg];W[ig]
(;B[ki];W[if]TR[ig][ih][ji][ij][hk][gk][hl][jk][kl][km][jm]
[im][lm][ln][lo][lp][ko][mo]C[B: Hoera! I managed to save my group.
Still wondering if B could kill it.

Jewdan: Actually, you didn't read out the variations you started far enough... this group should die. Try reading out all of the sequences you can think of from after Black playing J14 as you can. If you persevere, you will see that Black has a response to every trick White tries.

I do not say this nor include any of my own variations to be mean; I do this because this exercise may be the most important one for you to learn from this game. Push your reading capabilities to their limits, and you will grow. Your weakness throughout this games has been a lack of reading, and improving it will improve your game. Get a book on tesuji or fighting if you need some help (I would recommend _Tesuji_ by James Davies), but work through this until you are sick of it. Then, when you have recovered, do it again. The more you work this problem, the more you will grow.]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[kf]CR[rd]TR[dg][fg][hg][gi][hj][fj][fk]LB[fl:a]
[qi:b][qh:c][qj:d]C[Bu: Wondering what would be a good move for W now.
B has a huge territory on the right side.
Cut at F8 seems like a good idea, putting pressure on B's group.
b, c could invade B's territory
Any alternatives?

ps F8 is played at move 94

Jewdan: Black's mistakes have conspired to hand you the opportunity of taking Black's marked stones. There is nothing larger than F8 now.

As for invasions, you want to stay as far away from Black's wall - and your own dead stones - as much as possible. There are weaknesses in the wall, but I cannot contrive any sequence that would possibly allow you to exploit them.

There is an invasion at S16, but the fighting is really hard... it's probably a near-dan move. I'll try some variations, but I won't guarantee that I'm missing Black's proper responses.

See variation on White's move.]
(;W[nm]C[Jewdan: Save a move like this for a ko fight. It is simply aji-keshi... and this position only has aji in a situation where Black has to pick responding here or elsewhere.

In a situation like this, if you want to continue playing, a ko might be worth your while.]
;B[nn];W[om]C[Jewdan: Not even aji-keshi. Black should connect at F8.]
;B[ok]C[Jewdan: Black is afraid of a phantom here, but at least he hit the vital point.]
;W[fl]C[Jewdan: This was another chance to give yourself another fighting chance. Black's group has no eyes and little space to make eyes, but let's see how this fight should have progressed...]
;B[fi]
(;W[eh]C[Jewdan: This move is fine, since it makes Black heavy.]
;B[eg];W[fh]CR[eh][ei]LB[gf:A]C[Jewdan: This move, however, is NOT fine. White's two stones are already somewhat surrounded, and pushing at a place you cannot cut is only going to serve to surround them further. Black cannot hope to get an eye here, anyway (since F12 and H12 are miai), so why bother playing here at all?

Granted, it does not help Black live, but it is poor style.

I think the best move is another peep at G14 ('A'). After that, Black just doesn't have room for more than an eye, even with the bottom open (since it will take gote to get an eye on the bottom, leaving you free to destroy his eyespace in the center). Try reading out his attempts to live after G14.]
;B[gh];W[ch]C[Jewdan: This move is necessary after F12, and since it helps prevent Black from making eyespace, I have no complaints.]
;B[hf];W[ge]LB[he:A][gf:B][fe:C]C[Jewdan: An odd response... Why not the hane at H15 ('A')? If Black responds to 'A' at 'B', 'C' kills him.

This move leaves a lot of dangerous room for cutting that will not bode well should Black live.]
;B[ee];W[df]MA[gf][ff][fe][de]LB[ed:A]C[Jewdan: There are some problems with this move.

1) You just ignored a peep at E16. Peeps are often such scary moves that there is a proverb that states, "Even a fool responds to the peep." As you saw, Black can push through and wreak havoc in your upper position. Only risk this kind of cut when you know for a fact that it does not destroy you.

2) You created a pre-peeped tiger's mouth at D15. While not normally as devestating as a regular peep, a peep on a tiger's mouth is also bad news.

3) You did both #1 and #2, listed above, in the same move.

This means that you gave him room to fight when he should have had none. A simple response at E16 ('A') finishes him, since he needs four more moves (marked with crosses, where D15 and F15 are miai) to live, and you can take any of these points at any time to kill him once your position is secure.]
;B[fe]
(;W[he]C[Jewdan: Another mistake. This is the obvious response, but it protects the wrong cutting point. See the variation on this move.]

They tell your opponent that you do not respect their ability enough to be able to respond to such moves properly, and I for one interpret moves like this as bad sportsmanship (at least against opponents of my level, who know darned well that they won't work >_> ). It may be all right to play moves like this in a tournament, when winning and not growing is the priority, but in casual or learning games, please be polite and try no moves you know will not work.

Forgive me if I am being harsh, or if you thought these moves might work... I have had far too many games prolonged by as much as 45 minutes by people trying every little seeming weakness in my walls and territories when they were no true weaknesses at all. If you respect your opponent, you will find yourself taking your games more seriously and pushing yourself to find better moves; this is one of the easier ways to grow.]

C[Jewdan: This game ended much better than one would expect, considering that you, the player three stones weaker, took White. The difference in the skill between you and your opponent was decided simply by the depth and accuracy of your reading, so akoetou was not far off in saying that you are likely stronger than a 14k.

Get some books on tesuji and tsume-go if you do not have some already and start working on them. Even learning one new move can improve your level of play quite a bit, and if you haven't studied reading much yet, your improvement will be even more marked.

Don't forget the other principles I mentioned, such as the Four Questions and Don't Atari. While they were not the major sources of your loss, they will doubtlessly impact your future games if you start to practice them now.

If you have any questions, comments, or complaints, please E-mail me, and I will do my best to respond.

Good luck, and keep playing!

White's top is looking vulnerable, Black's formerly weak group is now secure, and he has sente, but White has captured 23 stones and has 36 moku in the area besides... a total of 80 moku. White's top is likely to be ravaged, but it is fair to expect White to get at least 16 points from it. Add komi, and White is at 102.5 moku.

Let's count Black. If he is exceedingly lucky, Black will get 118 moku, and win by 16.5 moku.... but if you look at why I included as his territory to arrive at that count, you can see that there is quite a lot of it ready to be reduced (with a move like M15 ('A').

In other words, the game is still playable. It will be a hard fight, but more than likely the game can be brought to a close and climactic finish after this battle that would leave both players happy.

C[Jewdan: There is another rule, like the Four Questions rule I mentioned earlier, that is right about 95% of the time. It is, "Don't atari." In most  cases where the atari threatens to capture something your opponent will want to save, he will connect, eliminating aji (potential) and strengthening his groups... never good. Only atari when you get something very useful for it.

This move does nothing but force Black to connect at R6, making his shape strong. Omitting it is best.]

;B[mq];W[pp]C[Jewdan: Hmm... this is aji-keshi (potential-destroying). Black does not stand to make too much territory by playing this point, and there are potential weaknesses in the shape due to the fact that it is not solidly connected.

(;W[qo]LB[qm:a][qq:b][ql:c]C[B: Reviewing the game now, I would rather invade at R5 now than at Q7.
R5 is also a good move for B, playing here prevents B making a corner enclosure here.
And I have good follow up moves.
If B pinces at R7 w can invade the corner at R3.
If B protects the corner at R3, W makes an ideal extension at R8

Jewdan: This move is too low. Black can respond quite happily at P5, a rarely seen move because of the obvious weaknesses on the other side... but in this case, K4 and J3 cover that weakness.]

Jewdan: Stay away from that hoshi! Play in the lower-right.]
))
(;W[cf]C[B: Is this bigger than G3?

Jewdan: C14 is a bad, greedy move. This kind of move aims at territory with a stone that is not intended to take territory (the hoshi). The best way to play with stones from which you want to get influence (or stones that already have thickness) is to play as far away from them as possible.

My own teacher is trying to pound into my own head the concept of the Four Questions. These Four Questions, when considered carefully and answered correctly, show an excellent move, if not the best move, 95% of the time. These questions are:
1) Where am I strong?
2) Where am I weak?
3) Where is my opponent strong?
4) Where is my opponent weak?
Once you have determined the answers to these facts, you play close to weakness (whether yours or your opponent's) and away from strength (whether yours or your opponent's).

This move is close to close to your strong stone at D16, and thus is bad. See, the trick of the hoshi stone is that you want to extend away from it while leaving wide gaps for your opponent to dive into (on your terms, of course). If he invades, you can either gain thickness by forcing him to live small and low, or you can gain solid territory and chase him out into the center. If he never invades... well, you'll end up with a very large territory.]

C[B: Hmm... B invades the bottom easily

Jewdan: Black gets 6 sure points with potential to gain another 4. White gains perfect thickness worth at least fifteen points alone and with potential for an impenetrable moyo built from the C10 stone. Leaping beneath like this is late middle game, not fuseki.

I have not yet answered your original question, but the answer is that neither H3 nor C14, or any similar moves in those regions, are any good at this stage of the game. The lower-right corner is the most urgent point on the board.

Black: right + bottom = ~15 + ~30 = ~45 moku
White: top + center + right + komi = ~30 + ~30 + ~5 + 6.5 = ~71.5 moku

[Read the tildes ( '~' ) as "approximately".\]

Despite ending the invasion in gote, the group is secure and Black is massively behind. Even if Black took the upper-right corner now, he would still be at least 15 moku behind, and thus cannot waste sente to do that.

With this sequence, White has taken advantage of Black's openings and has forced Black to start the middle game invading deep somewhere in White's moyo. However, if you will notice how I marked White's estimated points, White has staked out more than I've counted, and thus White will only gain points if Black invades as it becomes apparent exactly where White will gain his points. White can play to secure his lead and smile as Black struggles to catch up... and he will likely fail.
