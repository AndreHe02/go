C[Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game. I have put some  comments/questions which are marked (DR).
Please, give me any advise that you think it  could help me become stronger. I thank you in  advance for your valuable time.

 regginos 6k*: hello from Cyprus!];W[dp];B[nq];W[dd];B[jc];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[rb];B[od]LB[nc:a][ob:b][ql:c]C[bent: Did you consider 'a' instead? White may have to run without definite eye-shape or play 'b' with a painfully low position. Your move forces white to live on the upper edge while you build a strong wall, but if white then can play around 'c' your influence will be greatly reduced and of little helpfullness. Your move would be excellent if you already had a stone at 'c', or in another way, if you build a wall here it is important to struggle for sente.]
;W[oc]
(;B[nd];W[pd];B[pe]TR[pd]C[bent: Bad move from white, it is damezumari (taking away a liberty from his stones) and helps for nothing. One should only play this kind of exchange if there's an immediate follow up or threat (as cutting), else keep it in reserve.]
;W[nc]
(;B[md]LB[mc:a]TR[nc]C[maybe hane at "a" would be  better?perhaps not.black would be too  thin.(DR)

bent: you should have considered hane at 'a' or a move before at marked place (see variations), but it seems you can't take sente anyway, so in either case it'll be white's turn to play elsewhere.]

[rr][qr][pr][or][os][ps][qs][rs][ss][ri][rh][rg][sg][sh][si]
[qh][qg]C[i thought this was the right direction.(DR)

bent: The black group above is strong so the territorial value of R10 is not very big and it is to close to your strength. If you intended to make territory in front of your strength it would be nice to extend as far as the marked white stone. I would have played 'a', I presume white 'b', and it's black's turn to play elsewhere. Strength should serve for attack and often generates territory in another part of the board. Compare the marked areas, black 'a' is surely bigger and it keeps sente (because the black group above is not affected by w'b'), whereas w'c' needs to be answered as 'd' next would be to good to allow.]
;W[qo];B[qq];W[rq]C[i don't know how to handle such a move(DR)]
;B[rr]C[bent: this is ok.];W[rp];B[pq]LB[sr:a][qr:b][pr:c][kq:d]
[ok:e]C[bent: this is not. black's stones are not efficient and he still has to add a move at 'b' if white 'a'. You should leave the situation as it is and play elsewhere renouncing for the moment on attacking the white group above or play 'e' enlarging you sphere of influence possibly forcing white to strengthen your lower side group naturally while defending. If you want to respond locally, 'a', 'c' or 'd' seem better to me, but I'm not sure either.]
;W[qh]LB[pi:a][rl:b]C[bent: This is a gift, you should simply capture the stone by playing 'a' (work out some variations for yourself, I didn't, but I know white will be captured because black is to strong above). Attaching at 'b' as you did is to precipitated, helping white to strengthen himself. Your move is not a bad idea as it is some kind of leaning attack, but you don't need to strengthen white here to capture his invading stone]
;B[rl];W[rk];B[qk];W[rm];B[rj]LB[pl:a][qm:b][oi:c][nj:d][oh:e]
[mh:f]TR[qh]C[bent: You should have played atari at 'a' before, if w'b', then atari at 'S10', keeping sente to capture the marked stone with 'c' (or even 'd' (if w'e', b'f')).]

C[bent: This is not an urgent point. You should play elsewhere.]

Dear Dimitris
You didn't make many bad moves in this game but you didn't manage to take advantage of your opponents mistakes or overplays, even with a weak group being chased one has the feeling it was white who dicted the pace of the game. He got away with sente almost every time. Try to keep in mind the importance of sente/gote especially in 'fuseki manoeuvring'.
