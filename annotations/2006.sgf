C[Hi, my name is Pablo (Draculinio in KGS 15 kyu), ian I will make my best effort to review the game.
Maybe i will not give you the total solution (sometimes I don't know what the perfect solution is), I will give you clues and some sequences for you to look at.
Sorry for my bad english but i am from Argentina.];B[pd];W[pp]
;B[cd];W[dq];B[cj]C[Well, maybe c10 is not wrong, but better first vital points than big points, for example a shimari at e17]
;W[jq]C[same comentary , first vital points then big points]
;B[jd];W[cg]C[I really don't like this place ti invade, better a kakari (e17), c13 stone is pinced alone.]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[bn];W[co];B[pj];W[ql];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[pk]
C[I think that the intention here is to defend both sides.]
;B[qj];W[rl]C[And think that black defended better (stronger)]
;B[ok]C[This is why, now black makes an atari and can enter to white influence.]
;W[pl];B[oi];W[be];B[bc];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[fd]C[Right now i feel like black is developing better and white fighting just to survive, like I said earlier, the invasion here was not the best thing to do.]
;W[dj];B[ck];W[dk];B[hg];W[gg]C[Lots of contact moves, try to avoid this, contact will only reinforce your opponent force]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[df]C[What would whites best response to this move be?

Was the move before it wasted?

Well, I made a variation there, c14 makes a menace to cut, if he goes deeper you cut, if he goes back to connect then you close your territory. (actually, thats the way a poor 15 kyu see it, then a 1st dan comes and say "baka, this is bad", but still thinking it is better than make automatically an empty triangle.
But, you made the empty triangle (bad shape), in a very defensive move, this can become good if you can make a bigger territory later. But black made a good presure in the game and your move was not good.
I think you must play more agressive moves, maybe you will not win a lot of games now but you will learn more. If you can, study the variation i gave you and see what can be the results.]

C[Your next move was not neccesary, look at the variation i made. Instead of f9 you can invade the black upper part or make a bigger moyo]

(;W[fk];B[kj];W[kl];B[nm];W[nn]C[lots of contact moves...];B[ll]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[mm];B[ol];W[om];B[pm]C[The question of your next move, i made 2 possible variations.]

(;W[nl]C[Was this move necessary? Should i have concentrated on the invading stone and ignored his stone in atari?]
;B[pn];W[po];B[on];W[nm];B[rn]C[How would i go about protecting my territory from blacks invasion while still keeping my group of five safe?

Well you made it safe...];W[qn];B[qm];W[qo]C[In next move black made a mistake, see variation]

(;B[ro];W[rm];B[qq];W[rp];B[or]C[Whats the best way to stop black from taking the corner?

Well, i was reproducing this and i think that black will have the corner, bo maybe you need to reduce him as much as you can. (Well, later i made a variation where black dies, but study if all this can really happen)
If someone reads this and have another  variation where black dies please send me.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rr];W[rq];B[qs]C[Look at this variation, maybe it works]

(;W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[sr];W[so]C[Was this move necessary?

Well, counting at the libertyes not right now];B[hl];W[hm];B[im]
;W[in];B[gm];W[hn];B[em];W[fm];B[gl]C[study what coulded happen if black atari in f6]

;B[mj];W[mk];B[lj];W[jm];B[ik];W[il];B[jk]C[Just a general question: Do I go for captures at the expense of territory? Should i concentrate more on territory?

Better territory than stones];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]C[well the typical sequence is white r16]

C[The idea of black is save the sichou (ladder)];W[rg];B[rh]
;W[pe]C[Well black played a stone to save the sichou and then played elsewear...]
;B[ag]C[Could i have done anything in the top right corner to gain more territory?

maybe extending to n18 or trying to reduce using your strenght in that position but not a lot of points i think]
;W[bh];B[ah];W[af];B[aj]C[what if black instead of A10 plays atari at B14?]

;B[fr];W[hr];B[dr];W[er]C[What would have been a better move then E2?

 try c2, but i think this was 1 problem, g2 was a not needed contact move, i suggest you to solve some life & death problems to make your mind crear for this situations.]

;B[bk];W[cl];B[tt];W[bm]C[-Just some general comments and questions.

 Any advice on protecting my territory from intrusions like black did in the botton right?

Yes, watch your cuts, it is is better to lose a point somewere than to lose the bottom right like this.
For the corner i made 1 sequence that you saw but if you see it doesnt work just send me your idea.


 -Is there any way to take the top left corner?

I think no, it is all closed now.


Well, I think thats all, if you have questions i will be pleased to view the game with you and comment and look at other variations, you can find me in KGS (Draculinio 15kyu, all the time in cookies go club room) and some times in IGS (Ingwe). If you want, send me a mail to ingwe@keko.com.ar with questions and games.

ADVISES: -Make life & death problems
                   -Play more agressive.

Thank you for letting me review this game
