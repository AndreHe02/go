C[i felt like i played this entire game too passively, could you point out some places where i could have attacked or played more agressive moves as opposed to letting myself get led around the board.  i played black in this even game with 5.5 komi.  we are both rated 19k on kgs.


rhi: Hi, I'll do my best to focus on that "passiv/attacking" concept :-)]
;B[pd]C[ryancard [18k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[oq]LB[lq:A]
C[very strange white approach ...  perhaps should black make the pincer around 'A'  ?]
;B[pq]LB[qq:A]C[Hower, it is well know that "attaching moves" are defending moves:
you attach to strong opponents' stones to strengten your weak ones.
Here, your hoshi ain't weak but white is: you will strengten your opponent.
-> keeping  your idea, a better move is san-san at 'A'];W[np]
;B[pm]C[good answer, its ok for me there.];W[jp];B[jd];W[gc]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[be]LB[df:A]C[the right answer is upper: 'A']
;W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[bf]C[still better on the D14 point];W[df]
;B[dg];W[ee];B[cj];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[fg]C[so far i think i have played correctly

rhi: Yes,  i agree with that, every thing looks ok];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[if];B[kf]C[here i don't think is the biggest move, maybe along the right side or invade the lower muyo

rhi: it looks like a big big move to me: your creating a strongest moyo, it's ok.]
;W[gp];B[ef]C[hum ? what for ?  that's a wasted move];W[ff]
;B[de];W[ek];B[ej];W[hg];B[hh];W[gk];B[fj];W[fk];B[gj]C[watch out ! Your letting white create a big moyo while not doing anything but over concentrate your group.]
;W[ik];B[mo]LB[lp:A][jm:B][nn:C][cq:D][kh:E]C[this shoulder hit was all i could think off to reduce white, playing m4 looked dangerous

rhi: lets look at it  'A' is difficult to manage (neither do I know how to ;)
'B' looks like a nice "shrinking moyo " move
'C' gets my preference to stay in your direction
'D' is the biggest one I think

But what about building your own moyo around 'E'];W[mp];B[no]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[jn];B[jm];W[jl];B[kl];W[im];B[km]
;W[ih]C[waow! white should never have let you done that ...
by the way, he also got some of the pie ... looks even perhaps]
;B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[hl]C[this is a yose move: play it later]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[cq]C[yes ! At least ;)];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bm]C[here black should just play b8 right?]
;W[cm];B[al];W[am];B[an];W[kg]C[i think i lucked out here as white didn't take j11

rhi: I don't understand ... do you fear a capture ? loosing 4 points or so isn't very much at this time of the game.
white move at L13 is better as it shrinks very powerfully your moyo: very much points there !]
;B[lg];W[lh]
(;B[kh];W[jg];B[mh];W[li];B[mf]LB[mi:A]C['A' is better there, see next move]
;W[nj]C[arghh ! This _is_ the good white move.
And as we can see it later on, it destroys your central moyo :(]

that aggressiv enough isn't it ?];W[lm];B[ol]LB[pr:A]C[unnecessary, white looks dead there.
why don't you answer to white move now,
remember at 'a' ?
This is very expensive !];W[jb]C[what is the best defenase against this move?]

The more obvious thing is that both of you attach to much to the stones:
you should now try to take your distance from the stones.
play a bit more opened, do not stick to the stones.

However, the spirit of the game is good.
I don't see that it lacks of agressivity,
perhaps of strength: this ability do defend what is yours yet.

Amy way: good luck for the next years ;-)])
