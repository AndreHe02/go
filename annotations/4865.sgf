C[Hi .. this is one of my first games on IGS in wich i came realy close to winning so I would like to know if there is smt more I could of done in the end game phase , and also i whant to know if my opening was any good

probably there are lots of other mistakes arround so if u can point some of them out i would be realy gratefull.

PS and pls excuse my bad english but i`m not a native english speaker.

Reviewer (R): Don't worry; English isn't my native language either.]

(;B[qj]LB[pj:a]C[R: Unusual; normal would be 'a' to make the formation known as "san-ren-sei", or three star points. San-ren-sei wants to build a big moyo, inviting the opponent to invade, then getting strong by attacking him. A move on the third line means that there is no big moyo to be made, as it guards a bit better against a White invasion on the right side. However, there is a certain order of moves in the opening: First, empty corners. You both did that. Then, unbalanced corners - either enclose or approach. Unbalanced means "not on a diagonal", i.e., not 3-3 or 4-4. There is only one unbalanced corner in this game; it's the lower left corner. The reason balanced corners aren't urgent is that a stone on a 3-3 point is like an island, completely safe but it has no very good extensions. A stone on a 4-4 point can't enclose a corner with one stone; it would need two stones (one on either side) to enclose the corner, so it's not urgent to play there. However, the move you played also threatens a doubl-wing formation both on the top and the bottom, so White shouldn't igore it.]
;W[co]C[R: Enclosing a corner is good for White, but now Black gets a double-wing formation.]
;B[jc];W[jp]
(;B[ci]LB[cf:a][cl:b]C[now i`m not sure if this was appropriate maybe i should of gone more agresive at C17 or something arround there

R: No, invading the 3-3 point in the upper left would have been quite good for White. See variation. The idea of the played move is that it makes miai of extending to 'a' or to 'b'.

;B[cc]C[i`ve finaly made up my mind ... and managed to live there but whitse group at C13 and D12 realy botherd me later on

R: Invading here gives White the chance to build a big wall with which to attack your two separated stones on the left side. Also, you are creating too many weak groups.]

;W[ef];B[ff];W[eh];B[fg]C[R: The stronger Black gets here the less likely it is for the White stones above to escape. White is giving Black a large lead.]

(;W[ch]C[R: Very small. This black stone is not a threat to the White group.]
;B[ad]C[R: Small. Black is already alive in the corner, and this move doesn't threaten White. White should just ignore it.]
;W[bi]C[R: How many times does White want to capture that stone? White should invade on the right.]
;B[dk]LB[cg:a]C[i`m courious if i could of used my corner group to try and kill that whit below it

R: The white group at 'a'? No, you can't kill it. It's too strong. Your stone on the left side is absolutely no threat to it. In fact, it's a bad idea to run with it, like with this move. It only makes a heavy group without a base, without eyes, giving White an easy target for attack. With this attack, White can build a wall in the center, which he can then use to invade Black's moyo on the right side.]

(;W[cj]C[R: Very small-scale thinking. White is killing this black stone for the third time now. Think big!]
;B[ej];W[dj];B[fk];W[ck]C[R: More submissive moves from White. Actually White helps black to build a stable shape in the center. This is a waste, since White is so strong on the left side and on the bottom. White should attack from the center, pressing down on the black stones.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cn];B[fm];W[eo]
(;B[en]C[now i was relatively pleasd that i`ve managed to get some influence towrds the center  but again was there smt bigger to play ?

R: Well, your black group doesn't have two definitive eyes yet, but it's not in great danger as it can try to either link up to the stones above or to escape into the center. This particular move looks good, but it gives White many points at the bottom (see White's reply). However, White has already played so submissively...]
;W[fo]
(;B[hj];W[qf]C[now this rili annoyed me back then
and it gets even worse

R: Why did it annoy you? Did you expect White to sit back and wait while you made three quarters of the board into your territory? The idea of a moyo is to make such an imposing, huge, threatening structure that the opponent simply has to invade. Then you attack him and make profit.]

(;B[re];W[ri]
(;B[qi];W[rj]
(;B[rk];W[qh]C[R: The problem is that Black's shape has cutting points now.]

(;B[rg]C[this i belive to be a mistake
but i riealy wanted to keep the right side to myself

R: You can't expect to kill White. It's better to attack him from a direction in which you can make profit by building strength, for example, from the top. See the variation after when White invaded.]
;W[rh];B[ql];W[rf];B[sf];W[qe]
(;B[qg]C[R: This is bad. You need to secure the top.];W[pg]
;B[pf]C[and now things look grim white has another live group in the midle of my wouldbe territory

R: Like I said, it was never a question of killing White. But regarding this move: pushing up, letting White put Black in atari, then cutting is an idea I don't understand. What if White just takes those two stones? Anyway, you should look where your potential territory is going to be and secure it. The attack on the white group is over, unfortunately. Now White can attack Black's weak shape on the center right.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[se]
(;B[fb]LB[ec:a][pe:b]C[now i don`t know if that was realy necesary right now but i thought of that beeing more urgent then a move arround K6 or H6

R: It's a safe move, locally (or at 'a'), but in order to determine whether it's a good move for the whole game, you have to count. White has definitive territory on the left side, at the bottom and on the right side. Black has definitive territory at the top, a little in the center, and some potential on the bottom right. If the white invasion on the right side had been contained (sealed off) and been allowed to live small, then this move would be appropriate to completely secure the top. As it is, Black's position in the top right is full of holes - Black is thin there - so I'm not sure that you have time for it. Maybe you have to play at 'b' and bet on killing White should he move out with his five stones in the top left.]
;W[pe];B[of]C[R: Don't insist on saving every single stone. This stone is not important; it's not a cutting stone. You don't threaten White by escaping with it. On the contrary, now that White is alive, your stones are heavy and weak and White can just chase them into the center, all the while buillding a wall along the top side, which he can then use to devastate the top.]

(;W[oh]LB[qg:a]C[R: It's not necessary to protect this cut; White could take the two stones 'a' at any time.]
;B[oi];W[nh];B[md]C[wast this right... i think i`ve got a little worried becouse of whites escape to the center]

(;W[oe]C[Now Black is one move ahead at the top, but there are better ways for White to reduce the top; see variations.]
;B[od]C[R: White just gives Black many points at the top.];W[ne]
;B[nd];W[nf]C[R: This is a wasted move; Black's two stones neither could nor wanted to escape. It's like White has passed.]

(;B[ec]C[i think thiswas a mistake .. that group was dead anyway

R: Yes. Ok, Black has passed as well. :)];W[mq];B[or]C[This move helps White to take a lot of territory at the bottom. Black's territory in the lower right corner isn't so big; White can still reduce it.]
;W[mr]
(;B[hm]C[mybe somewhere on the 6 line would of been better

R: This is passive; it just lets White continue to take territory below. Black didn't gain much with this move, but White did.]

;W[fh];B[gh]

(;B[hc]C[got scared again i think

R: Yes, it's very small. You are playing inside your own territory. See variation.]

(;W[ni]C[R: It's not necessary for White to put one stone next to each other. With a living shape, White can play more ambitiously.]

thankyou for your time !

R: You're welcome. Both players made many mistakes. You both helped each other to territory; also, Black didn't attack the White invasion on the right effectively. The idea of an attack is not to kill, but to take profit. Read "Attack and Defense" (see http://gobooks.nemir.org/books/k14.html). And solve a lot of life-and-death problems, which will show you the basic shapes and also gives you a feeling for when a group is strong and can be attacked and when the attack is over.

Yes, you could easily have made two points in the endgame and won, but the other mistakes I've pointed out were much bigger. Take especial care of the direction of play. Only when you've determined which direction you want to play in (where you want to drive the opponent's stones) can you begin reading out variations.]
