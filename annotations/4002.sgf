C[Z: I'm playing white in this game. Me and my opponent are both 9k on KGS.

I cant see any big mistakes in this game, and my opponent plays pretty safely rather than trying to challenge me when I reduce his territory, but still I lose by 1,5 points. I'd appreciate if you told me what am I doing wrong and in which part of the game? I feel my weakest part is usually a not too long before yose starts.

In this game I play roughly to best of my ability, so I think it would be good to know generally what I'm doing wrong.

Thank you.

N: First of all, this was a nice game, in my opinion, if you can controll yourself it is always good to try to play a calm game. If you judge your opponent made a wrong move/overplay you should try to punnish him in some way. But not running blindly into every opportunity to fight is certainly a good attitude. 

To comment a game who ended with such a small difference is difficult because there where probably many opportunities where the 1.5 difference could have been erased and it is not possible to mark the decissive/game losening move. However in this game there was one place of the board that was flashing at my eyes for a long time before somebody played there, although it was a double sente move for both, worth 4 points. Nowing the concept of double sente, could have won you this game with a margin of 2.5 points without doing anything else differently. So i think this is an important lesson from this game.]

C[N: this is a seldomly played move, in this situation A, B and C are the most played moves by professionals in that order, D is also played but much less frequent than an approach in the other corner. So mostly they seem to judge that after black prevents a white shimari, white should prevent a black shimari in the lower left.]
;B[dh]C[N: this is not so good by black, because now in the near future you can choose to attach and leave black with a two space extension from a two stone wall.
Now for this time it might be more urgent to prevent a black shimari in the lower left.

(;W[pq]C[N: this is too small, you are lucky that black responds. Your group is not in any danger and your move doesn't cause danger to the black group. Black could now take a big point.]

(;W[ic]LB[mc:A][oc:B]C[N: Approaching from the other side seems better to me. A is a nice point for you to take in combination with your two stones in the upper right. Also now you are inviting a black move at B. See variation.]

(;W[bd]C[N: The sequence you start now is gote. See variation for taking the corner in sente.]
;B[be];W[cd]LB[ad:A][ae:B]C[N: from now on a black move at A is almost sente (maybe now white can think of ignoring it but as we go into the endgame he can't no more)
and white B is sente. Since playing there is sente for both sides, such a move is called 'double sente' The difference is four points extra for the player who plays first.]
;B[ql]C[N: Here white is ahead in territory, black has some more influence. In the variations are some ideas to reduce the black framework on the right.]

(;W[on]C[N: better to play on the left side i think. On the left, black can enlarge his moyo by leaning on your bottom group as he did. So he has more potential for territory on the left. It seems to me as if you followed your opponent.]
