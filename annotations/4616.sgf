C[Hello, this is a game i have played recently on KGS. In the moment, i am 19k. My opponent had already been ranked 8k, but he didn't play for a long time (2 years), so he is ranked 20k. But i felt he is better than 20k! In fact i lost :-(

I am white

;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[qk];W[nq];B[lp];W[pp]LB[pp:B][qp:C]
[qq:A]C[[Broege: According to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary White usually plays A, then Black plays B or C. Please see Kogo's for details.\]]
;B[qp];W[op];B[qo];W[mp]C[i don't think this sequence is very good for white, isn't it ?

[Broege: Yes, White seems rather cramped here. The problem started with Q4 move, see the previous comment.\]]
;B[eq];W[cn]LB[gq:A][hq:B]TR[lp]C[[Broege: Perhaps a pincer at A or B should be better - it would weaken the triangled Black stone and allow to strengthen White group while attacking it.\]]
;B[hq];W[lo]LB[om:A][qm:B]C[i played this move to forbid black to jump from its stone in M4 and starting building a wall toward the upper side of the board

[Broege: Personally I would prefer to jump first to A to put more pressure on Black, threatening B.\]]
;B[cf]LB[lo:A]C[but i think i should have first extended from the hoshi stone in D16 to form a big moyo, because he is already ahead in territory

[Broege: I think the decision to strengthen O3 group was correct - as C4 and C6 stones are low (third line) taking territory on the left side is not that profitable.
As for making moyo to gain territory - I think that moyos are built for influence rather than territory. Having a moyo and a weak group (imagine Black A two moves earlier) can prove disastrous - while chasing the weak group Black would destroy moyo easily.\]]
;W[ch];B[bd]
(;W[df]LB[cc:A]C[[Broege: This is risky. Black can take the whole corner after playing A (either now or a move later). Probably Black can also use weakness in White stones to break through.
See variant for a calm and safe version which certainly is not worse for White.\]]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi]
(;W[bj]C[This is a mistake i think. i think i should have simply continue at C10 and continue pushing him along the second line (something like in the variation).

[Broege: I think this is correct - see the variation. Generally hane at the head of two stones is correct - it's even in a proverb :) If you want to be on the safe side you could hane after three stones to stop Black.\]]
;B[cj]
(;W[dj]C[[Broege: The mistake is here, not in the previous move. See the variations.\]]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[dk];W[ej]LB[dh:C][di:B][bl:A]C[[Broege: Extending at A would be better. Black could give double atari at B but after C White still would be better off.\]]
;B[bl];W[cl];B[ak];W[bm];B[al];W[am]LB[kd:A][ld:B]C[[Broege: Generally it's wrong to play yose moves so early. White move is not urgent - Black cannot gain anything here (ok, 1 point after playing A7) so White should play some other move instead - like making big extension at A or B.
Playing out situation like this is, at best, loosing ko threats. Most likely however Black will ignore such a small move (here the threat behind it is quite large) and play a big move for himself.\]]
;B[aj];W[dl]TR[ek][fk][el][fl][em][fm]C[[Broege: Again, this is not an important move. The triangled area is not White territory so it does not need to protected. White is split into two groups but that is not a problem as both groups are safe.\]]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[cr]LB[fj:A]C[[Broege: This is an example of a Black move ignoring small White move. Instead of playing A White could have played here himself.\]]
;W[bq];B[jc]LB[fj:C][dl:B][am:A]C[black takes the big point

[Broege: Exactly. White has played at least three moves (A, B and C) of which any could be spared to play on the top and stop Black from making this move.\]]
;W[qc]LB[dg:A][nq:B]TR[mc][nc][qf][qg][qh]C[and i'm afraid so i make this san-san invasion to reduce its territory, but this is not a lot

[Broege: As Black position is still quite open perhaps an invasion in any of the triangled areas would be better.
Anyway - White position is quite hopeless now - Black is safe everywhere, took territory in three corners and White has two groups facing the center (A and B) which are safe but take no territory and a small territory in the lower left corner.\]]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]LB[pe:B][qg:A]C[[Broege: This is overplay by Black, the joseki is at A. Here cuts at A and B are too serious and can be used by White to escape or gain advantage outside - see the variations.\]]

(;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]LB[qb:A]C[[Broege: Play at A finishes the corner.\]]
;B[oc];W[kp];B[jr];W[iq]LB[kq:A]C[this is not a bad move i think.
maybe i shoul have played keima at J5

[Broege: A simpler move at A would be OK. Black is already safe here so there is no much use in forcing an attack.\]]
;B[ir];W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[go];W[hn]LB[pe:A][qg:B]
[ki:C][in:D]C[now i'm thinking of playing in the center to forbid black to enclose to much teritory

[Broege: There is a saying that there is no (or little) territory in the center. After Black plays near tenger White can use cutting points at A and B to either live inside or gain some more territory on the right edge.
And again - if you are planning to play a big move like C then why play D first? It was not really needed to secure White group and ended in gote for White.\]]
;B[ki]C[but he played first

[Broege: Black has mapped quite a large moyo - but it's definitely not a territory yet.\]]
;W[ih]LB[je:B][ke:D][qg:A][oj:E][ok:C]C[i think i could have played better than that to reduce him, but i didn't know how.

Where to play ?

[Broege: Personally I would start by cutting at A and then trying some forcing moves around to make a deep invasion. White is already losing by a big margin so desperate measures are needed. I'm not sure such an invasion would succeed (probably not) - but I see no other possibility to win the game for White.
As for a reduction - how about B or C, or, if one is feeling adventurous, D or E?\]]
;B[kg]
(;W[jf]LB[je:A]C[[Broege: Perhaps a capping play at A would be better as it cannot be so easily blocked - see the variations.\]]
;B[kf];W[je];B[ke]C[my moves are totally useless to reduce black's territory

[Broege: The problem with these moves is that they force Black to put stones in a solid wall - thus creating territory. If you want to reduce enemy's moyo more you have to make some sacrifices. One good way is to threaten reduction from one direction and sacrifice it to enter from another.\]]
;W[om]LB[oj:B][ok:C][pm:A]C[[Broege: This move only induces Black to take territory on the side. Playing at A would be more sever for Black as he would have to connect on the second line. Reduction at B or C instead would be preferrable though - you have to hit Black where it hurts.\]]
;B[qm];W[ok]LB[qg:C][oh:D][nj:A][oj:B]C[[Broege: Now this move is too weak - you have to play on the limit if you are already losing to catch up with your opponent. Otherwise he will just play safe and still win.
White can easily enter at A or B. Because of cut at C possibly White could even get away with D.\]]
;B[pi]C[[Broege: Black plays it safe because White does not put any pressure on him - he is still winning by at least 30 points.
From now on I will comment only on local plays, trying to show some more common alternatives - strategically the game is lost.\]]

(;W[fk];B[fc]LB[ic:C][hd:B][fk:A]C[i should have played somewhere around here (like H16) first,instead of my last move. this is a big mistake i think, cause i'm already late in territory, and i'm giving him the possibility to reduce me a bit more.

[Broege: Yes - this is another example of small moves versus big moves. A move like A does not serve any purpose. White should have tried to protect the little territory he's got with a move like B or C.\]]
;W[fd]LB[gc:B][hc:A]TR[cc][dc]C[[Broege: Why not play at A? Black cannot connect to B16 stone as he needs to play both triangles points and he will have to fight to connect to K17 stone.
This way Black will gladly play B taking a lot of territory on the top.\]]

[lr:G][or:E][pr:C][qr:D]C[i should have hane at L10

[Broege: Not really - it does not protect that much- please see the variation. After Black plays F White can take more territory with the upper group - so the net result is not that bad.
On the other hand White is left with very little to choose from. Typical yose moves would be:
A (sente because of B),
C (gote, with D and E as the continuation),
G to stop M4 stone from coming alive,
H to put pressure on Black bottom group and try to take few points of territory after I
\]]
(;W[bb];B[kj]C[now it's too late];W[lk]LB[jh:A]C[[Broege: Typically it's best to play forcing moves like A before protecting own territory.
Such moves have to be answered (otherwise Black will be cut off) and allow for more freedom later as own groups are slightly stronger.\]]

;B[if]C[I give up

thank you for commenting my game :-)

[Broege: I think the main advice for you would be to refrain from playing small or unimportant moves when there are much bigger points to be played.
Quite a few examples of such small moves were played in the opening and in middle game. You noticed most of them by yourself - only just too late when your opponent played them. Trying to see them just one move earlier might give you an edge :)

As for tactical side - you seem to make typical errors for "high kyu", perhaps with particular weakness when it comes to cutting and connecting. I would recommend doing some problems on goproblems.com - you may choose problems for a given theme and practice your reading. You will also learn a few usefull tesujis this way which will allow you to quickly find better moves.

The last advice - if you play a fighting move (trying to cut, protecting a cut, etc.) try to play the most severe move. Otherwise you will be often forced by stronger opponents, many times with moves that does not actually work.\]]
