 > below follows a game I just played as white on IGS.  May I
ask for a review with special regard on two questions.  Firstly
it appeared to me that I played a rather weak opening and only
won by killing the black corner in the end.  Hence I would appreciate
comments on those opening moves that were particularly bad, and
some general directions
on how to improve this.  Secondly, my opponent warned me before
the game that he/she was much stronger than his/her current rating
of 27k, which turned out to be true.  Is it possible to assess
the true strength from this single game, at least vaguely?

Fegg replies:

in the endgame I cannot guess what level black is from the one
game.

White's opening was a little weak, but there were several great
opportunities up to about move 66. By move 79 white's future
was bleak.

Black had the misfortune to try to win big, gambling the corner
away in the process, and losing the game.

I hope you find my comments helpful. I have tried to talk about
general ideas when possible (walls, aji, sente, gote, "just win",
"rich men do not pick fights").];B[qd];W[pp];B[eq];W[cd];B[ec]

Blacks upper groups are all strong. A go proverb states "keep

your opponent's strength.

this fact to his advantage.]

(;W[jp]C[White should continue the pincer against the two stones to the
right. As black struggles for life, white will get stronger in
the corner as well as at the bottom. This will (hopefully lead
to Q8 dying to give a large area for white.

;W[mq];B[mp];W[np];B[nq]C[White should consider leaving lost battles like these as early
as possible. Continuing to fight reduces the "aji" (latent possiblities)
of the dying stones.

For example if white plays elsewhere now (or P4 then elsewhere)
then much later on it may be useful for white to try to make
eyespace for the K3 group. If white plays at M4 (atari) the black
N2, white L3 (atari), black N3. Now white has used his dead stones
to help his group of three to survive. The point is not that
the above is likely, but that if white plays out the position
(eg by playing N2 immediatly) white can gain nothing later. The
"aji" of N3 will be destroyed.

in "dead" stones.]

A go playing friend of mine has an excellent moto.

He says "JUST WIN". This endgame is a perfect example of when
the phrase would be ringing in my ears. He means when you are
ahead, just play simple moves that allow you to end up winning.
A complicated play that allows you to win by 80 points is FAR
WORSE than a simple set of moves that allow you to win by 15
points!

So black should have checked the score (black is winning by 12
points). Then select a simple, safe move (preferably sente).]
