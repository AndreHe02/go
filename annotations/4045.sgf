;B[qd]C[[AC\] Hi, I'd like to thanks the reviewer. I am very novice, but this match I just played seemed interesting to me becuase I (as white) felt behind the entire game but came out quite well. Both my challenger and I are 22k, so I'm sure there are too many errors to comment on, but any standard strategic input are greatly appreciated. Thanks again.

Ryzours : Hi !
I'll be reviewing this game for you.
As I'm curently 12k on KGS, keep in mind that my way of playing is still full of mistakes. You'll have to think for yourself about everything I say.

This game was a close fighting game, in what I would call the "Igs style". Both opponents are applying pressure upon each other, and sometimes fail to get a good view of the whole board. I'll try to point out the biggest strategical mistakes.]
;W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[dn];W[co]C[[AC\] I don't really know joseki, so all responses in my game are just my intuition.]
;B[dl];W[qf]C[[AC\] I wanted to see how he responds to a similar attack.

Ryzours : Actually, it's not a similar attack. The stones on the lower left are on the forth line, emphasing influence over territory, whereas the top right ones are on the third line,  where territory is easier to build.]
;B[oc]LB[fq:B][dr:A]C[Ryzours : As a result, black gets solid territory in the top right, but the bottom left corner is still open to attacks like A or B.]
;W[kq]LB[pj:A]C[[AC\] I think that this is a low chinese, which is all I know.

Ryzours : Now you're supposed to play around A to build a moyo.]
;B[qn];W[pl]C[[AC\] I was thinking of moving to P3 mirroring his P17, but thought that this might strengthen R14. Also I like the idea of pincers. Is this reasonable?

Ryzours : The pincer is more in the spirit of the chinese fuseki. Playing P3 might allow your opponent to play R11, thus getting life, territory and attacking your R14 stone.]
;B[ql];W[pj];B[qj];W[ph];B[pn];W[op];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro];W[lc]
C[[AC\] at this point I wasn't happy that I wasn't able to prevent him from gaining the right side, so I think this attack was kind of rash... As in chess, I always feel overwhelmed in the beginning as I don't know where to go, and at this point I think I had used a conciderably more time than black.

Ryzours : Black has territory on the right side, but white has influence towards the center, so the situation is not that bad.]
;B[hc];W[on]LB[cf:B][ji:A]C[Ryzours : Playing  around A instead might help white to get a moyo. And the top left is still wide open. I don't like P6, as a contact play might lead to complicated fights, and there still nothing to fight for.]
;B[pm];W[pk];B[qk];W[le]LB[om:A]C[Ryzours : You should as well play A to prevent black from coming to the center. It was maybe the purpose of P6, so it's probably a good idea to finish the job.]
;B[jd];W[ne];B[oe];W[of];B[pe];W[pf]LB[cf:A][jj:C][gp:B]C[Ryzours : This move doesn't seem important. Why not play elsewhere instead?]
;B[jf];W[om];B[qo]C[Ryzours : This is a small attack by black. There are more important things to do.]
;W[jc]LB[cg:B][kh:A]C[Ryzours : If you don't reply to black's attack, which might cost you points in the bottom right corner, then try yo make a move that might give you more points!  It's hard to know the result of a move like K17, and it's probably worth less than plain Q4.]

;B[nd];W[nc];B[od];W[nb];B[lf];W[me];B[ob];W[oa];B[pa];W[na]
;B[qb]C[[AC\] I thought that this was clever, as I always play Q18 in this situation.]
;W[nf]LB[cf:A][jj:B][gp:C]C[Ryzours : The last few moves where very small and slow, when so many big points are still availlable.]
;B[qi];W[pi]C[[AC\] I thought of playing R12 instead, but was afraid it would somehow be able to surround Q(8,9,10) block.

Ryzours : R12 might have been ok.];B[qh];W[qg]C[Ryzours : Really slow move.  Look at the result of the game, and imagine R13 is a black stone. It's doesn't change the results by even a point. So R13 is not a good move at this moment of the game. The top right is settled, and being the first to play in another part of the goban might give a decisive advantage.]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[sh];W[sf];B[sg];W[ib];B[hb];W[kg];B[kf];W[di]
C[Ryzours : The two last white moves worth more than the 10 ones before. Now white is clearly ahead.]
;B[dg];W[fi];B[fg];W[hg]LB[jg:A]SQ[ie][if]C[Ryzours : I like A better. The 2 marked stones are not really important, and it's better to make a big center territory.]
;B[cn];W[ep]LB[fp:A][gp:B][fq:D][gq:C][hq:E]SQ[kq]C[Ryzours : A to E is better, as it also helps the marked stone.]
;B[jg]
(;W[jh]C[[AC\] This move always gives me trouble but I never know what else I should do. The following steps he ended up weeding his way towards the center.

Ryzours : Blocking him farther might be a good idea.];B[kh]

;W[gh];B[fd];W[fk];B[fl];W[el]C[Ryzours : This kind of move might lead to a fight, and your group is the more likely to die in this fight.]

(;B[em];W[ek];B[gl];W[en]LB[ch:B][dk:A]C[Ryzours : A or B look better, your group is still in danger.]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[hk]LB[cj:A]C[Ryzours : black should resume his attack.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[bm];B[cm]LB[cj:A]C[Ryzours :  Black should focus on the attack and play A instead.]
;W[bn]CR[cl][dl][cm][cn][dn]SQ[dm][fm]C[[AC\] I really thought I was going to capture his C7 cluster... please let me know what I did wrong here

Ryzours : Well, the marked stones have 3 outside liberties, and two moves ( marked as squares) are needed to save them, so you can't capture if your opponent makes no mistakes.]
;B[bl];W[bo]LB[bh:A]C[Ryzours :  This move is not needed. Playing around A is better, you should focus on saving your stones.]
;B[ck];W[cj]C[[AC\] Perhaps B9 instead?

Ryzours : B9 doesn't work.];B[bj];W[bi];B[aj];W[ak];B[bk];W[bg]

(;B[bf];W[cg];B[cf];W[af];B[ae];W[ag];B[bd];W[ch];B[hh];W[gg]
;B[kl]C[[AC\] Right here I felt I had lost the game... since I had lost most of the battles, and it seemed he had started his ways into the center.

Ryzours :  The bottom is very big and might become completely yours. You still have decent territory in the center and you can reduce your opponent's on the top left. You're ahead.]
;W[hp]C[Ryzours :  Good, now the bottom is even more likely to be yours.]
;B[in];W[kn];B[jm];W[mn];B[io];W[jn]LB[ip:A]C[Ryzours : Protecting your territory with A is better.]
;B[ho];W[gp];B[ip];W[iq];B[mg]C[[AC\] This move I thought was clever... I didn't forsee it, and it frustrated the hell out of me that he gained so much.]
;W[lh];B[mf];W[nh]C[[AC\] just a careless mistake as I];B[mh]
;W[mi];B[ng]
(;W[ni]C[[AC\] My original plan was to play P13, but I did not predict the vulnerability at O11.]
;B[og];W[oh]C[Ryzours : This move is useless, only 1 point worth.]
;B[pg];W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[kj];W[mk];B[pp]C[[AC\] This cost me the corner. Could you give let me know how I could have prevented it from here?]
;W[pq];B[qq]
(;W[pr];B[rr];W[qr];B[sq];W[rs];B[sr]C[Ryzours :  You handled the situation on the bottom right quite well.]

;B[im];W[km];B[ik]C[Ryzours :  useless move by black.]
(;W[eh]C[[AC\] For a long time I didn't like the shape here around E11, I didn't know what to do with it at all, and really thought it seemed like randomly placed stones]
;B[eg]C[[AC\] I somewhat expected him to invade at either D12 or F12.]

;W[gi];B[hi];W[gk];B[je];W[fh];B[cr];W[dr]C[[AC\] I think I play this well...

Ryzours :  you did.];B[bq];W[cq];B[cs];W[ar];B[do];W[bp];B[ds]
;W[br]C[[AC\] I was proud of this move, and more relieved when he then passed, as I was still worried if he cut at H3, or invaded around O3ish area.
When the results came in at 92.5 to 75, I realized I can't count stones at all.


[AC\] Thank you for the review, I'm sure it will help.


Ryzours : Is was a good game, Moves 74 and 132 were the key moves, playing them before your opponent won you the game. But these moves might have been played before you did, there was plenty of time. Even if IGS games are fast and fight oriented, you have to learn to look at the whole board and to play big points before your opponent do.]
