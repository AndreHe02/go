C[Hello reviewer, I am Mark Fyffe and play white in this game.  This game had a bit of fighting, though nothing too eventful, and settled down to a close endgame driven by a two step ko.  In the end, I lost by 1.5 and would really like to have been able to find those 2 points ;-)  Thanks in advance for your review.



Qian:
Happy to see your game.
My English is not very good, if there is some "bad English" please let me know.:)]

Usually people do not play like this, the space down side is too big.
err...   looks cool anyway.];W[qf];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc]
(;B[pe];W[pc];B[qh];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[re];W[qq]C[bucky: is this timing OK?  Given black's center moyo I would not consider play 3-3 here if black p4 was at q4, but while playing it seemed perfectly natural in this position.


Qian:
In my opinion there is a lot of possible choices in this situation, it's really hard to tell which one is better.]

Qian:
I think it'll be hard for a clean kill, see those b stones, b have sente around A, B.
This will be complex. I'd rather place a stone around C after b F2.]
