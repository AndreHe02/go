C[Marlix (10k KGS):

Hi,

The first 45 moves felt like i was doing fine. After that in the middle a few things failed and in the end i had to resign. I dont know what went wrong. Can you give me some general advise? What is my weakest point in play? How to improve my play?

Thanks in advance for your time!


catch22 (4k IGS):

Hi,

I'll be reviewing your game. I will give comments through out, and close off with some general advice. 

I should say that I think you picked a great game to be reviewed. It is a game of territory (Black) v.s. influence (White). Going for influence first, and catching up on territory later is a more high level strategy than going for territory directly. It requires skill to pull it off, but it is great to watch when it works (unless you're on the other end of the board of course ;-).]

;B[pn];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp]C[Marlix: The correct move for white is K4 I thought.. This felt good for me

catch22: K4 is indeed the common joseki move. Still, I think White got a decent result.]
;B[jp];W[mq];B[iq];W[kn];B[fq]C[catch22: Although this move is dual-purpose, i.e. an extension as well as an approach move, I don't think this is the best move.

Black's four stones are pretty strong already. They can be left alone for now because Black can consider F3 and J6 as miai. If White takes one of these, Black can take the other. 

Furthermore, the stone at F3 is too close to the other four stones to be efficient. This becomes particularly apparent if White plays as I've shown in the variation for the next move.

So, all in all, Black is probably better off using sente to make a big move elsewhere on the board, for instance at R10. This starts a big framework for Black, and also helps the two stones in the bottom right, which have become a bit weak.]

;W[go];B[fp];W[fo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[qk];B[qi];W[qm];B[qn]
;W[pm];B[pr]C[Marlix: Think i was lucky here? This group looked a bit weak.

catch22: You definitely had to make this move to secure these stones. They would have come under severe attack otherwise. However, I would not say you were lucky. The white stones at the right side were always weaker than your corner stones, so White could never have mounted a successful attack.]
;W[nm];B[ch];W[db];B[fe];W[el]
(;B[lc]C[Marlix: This move is bad i think

catch22: Yes, it's not great. First of all, it does not defend against White's invasion that is to follow. Secondly, although it's a good move for taking away the eye space of the white group, an attack seems premature. Because White is strong in the center, the group can easily run away to safety. 

Before looking at alternative moves, let's take stock of the situation so far. Black is definitely ahead in territory. White's only real territory is at the top left, and that's pretty much cancelled out by Black's territory in the bottom right. On top of that, Black has secured territory at the bottom, and good prospects for creating territory in the top right (although it's too early to consider all of this as territory already). On the other hand, White has created significant influence in the center. So Black's main worry should be to stop White from using this influence 1) to mount effective attacks on Black's groups, and 2) to build a big framework in the center. While doing so, Black should attempt to secure and expand his own territory.

I think, therefore that a better move for Black would be K14 (see variation).]
;W[hd]C[catch22: This is painful.];B[hc];W[gd];B[gc];W[fd]C[Marlix: could i have done better?

catch22: I don't think so. I cannot see how you could have captured the invading White stone.]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[dc]C[catch22: Don't play this move if you are not going to follow it up. 

If there is no good follow up, you should not play this move now. It only gains you a point, whereas your chain of stones loose a liberty, which could be a precious loss in potential future fighting. Furthermore, if you don't play it now, this move could become a ko threat later on. Finally, you loose the potential to play differently. For instance, if you don't play this move, C17 could be the start of a successful invasion later on.

So, in short, do not play moves just because they are forcing moves and the other player will respond to them. If possible, keep your options open.]
;W[cc]C[Marlix: could i have done better?

catch22: As I said before, I don't you could have prevented White from saving his invading stone. You shouldn't have made the final push, but other than that, this result looks okay for both sides.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[mn];B[mm]C[catch22: This cut seems a bit premature. Although it splits White into two weak groups, Black does not have any stones nearby to help the cutting stone.]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[nj];B[mh];W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[jg]C[catch22: This looks like a severe attack. The only problem is that Black's stones are spread out a bit too thinly. So White may escape, without Black having anything to show for it....]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[lh]C[Marlix: i tried to make a weak group for white but ended up with white catching me.. What did I do wrong? What should I have done?

catch22: Often, instead of starting a speculative "all or nothing" fight, where the main aim is to kill, it is better to have less ambitious aims, which are more achievable. For instance, just attacking White's group so that it has to run away, while Black gets influence and/or secures territory is good enough.

In this case, maybe before mounting the attack with K13, Black should have first re-inforced his position with a move at P12 or thereabouts. This secures more territory for Black, as it defends against an invasion at R13. Subsequently, Black can attack in all earnest, or if White defends, make a big move elsewhere.]
;W[oh];B[ng];W[og];B[of];W[nf]
(;B[mf]TR[mi][mh][lh][ng]C[catch22: Given your follow-up, this is a pointless move. In positions like this, you should always try to fully read sequences out. If you see a way to save your marked stones, do so. If not, do not carry on irregardless. Consider for instance sacrificing them instead. As the variation shows, this works perfectly.]
;W[ne];B[me]C[catch22: This is a poor move by Black. As White's next move shows, White can easily rescue his stones. So all Black is doing is donating a stone. If, after looking long and hard, you can't see a good follow-up, play elsewhere. Do not carry on irregardless.]
;W[mg];B[md]C[catch22: I think Black's disappointment is showing, as this is another gift to White. If White wanted to, he could simply capture the three Black stones by playing at N17.

That does not mean that White should now capture these three stones, because it is quite small. It is worth only a few points. White stones are all linked up already (he can capture the O13 stone at anytime, and there is nothing Black can do about that).]
;W[li]TR[mg][lg][lf][nf][ne][nd][nc][og][oh]C[catch22: This move is not really necessary, as White's marked stones are already save (for now).

If White wanted to strengthen his position anyway, there are better ways of doing so. For instance, N17 would capture three stones (and prevent Black from starting a squeeze with M15). Locally, L11 seems slightly better, as it also prevent Black from pulling out his three stones, yet it does not give Black the atari at K12 or L11, which he has now.]
;B[gl]C[catch22: This attack/invasion is too aggresive. White is strong here, so Black should be more careful. Make sure that your invasions/attacks are supported by nearby strength before starting them.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[ij];B[ki];W[nh]C[catch22: There is no need for White to capture just yet. Black would put himself in atari if he tries to safe his O13 stone at the moment. Instead, a better move for White would be to capture at H9, and make a strong ponnuki shape in the center.]
;B[jh];W[ni]C[catch22: Another unnecessary move. White is connected as is.]
;B[kh]TR[mi][mh][lh]C[catch22: This move is also better left unplayed. The three black stones do not have a purpose anymore, so saving them is worth only about three points. Therefore you should take sente and make a bigger move elsewhere.]
;W[jj];B[hk]C[catch22: Before making a move like this, be sure that these stones can be saved. Or at the very least, that they can be usefully sacrificed. If not, you are just giving away points.

It looks as if these stones cannot be rescued, so you're better off playing elsewhere.]
;W[gi];B[in];W[io];B[jo];W[jn];B[ho]
(;W[im]C[catch22: Not a good move by White. He is better off playing double atari at H6 (see variation).]
;B[hn];W[hm]C[Marlix: Was it possible to resque those stones?

catch22: I don't think so. The initial move at G8 was to deep to start with.]

(;B[gm]C[catch22: It should be clear that this does not work. So don't persist and give away more points. 

Playing at G6 looks more promising though. See variation.];W[gn]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[fm];B[bg];W[fg];B[bf]C[catch22: A push like this does not give you many points. As an end game move a monkey jump (to A16), or a jump to B15 (which threathens to cut at C16) is bigger.

In this case though, as the group is still weak and White's influence looks menacing, it may the better move though, as it increases Black's eye space. This only helps to illustrate though, that White's strength indirectly affects  the territorial balance.]
;W[be]
(;B[hf]SQ[hc][gc][fc][ec][dc]TR[ki][kh][jh][jg][kg][lh][mh]
[mi]C[catch22: This is not a good move. Instead of making minor dents in White's territory, Black should fix his own weaknesses first. For instance, as it stands, White can still cut off the eight marked Black stones. 

A better move would therefore be J16. This stops White from capturing the marked stones, and also helps the chain of marked Black stones, which are still dangerously short of liberties.]

(;W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[df];W[de];B[ef]C[catch22: This shows lack of reading skill. As White goes on to demonstrate, these stones can all be captured.

Even if this were not the case, saving a single stone is very small. Black is better off re-inforcing his group in the top right (R17 and  R13 are both still weak spots).]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[cg];W[ce];B[di];W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[mo]
C[catch22: Another poor move...];W[ln];B[np];W[mp];B[oo]C[catch22: ... Black lost sente, just to capture one stone. 
Pretty much any move along the sides of the board is worth more points. In particular, you should be looking to play sente moves: moves that White will find hard to ignore so that you retain the initiative.]

(;W[cm]C[catch22: Because White is strong here, he can play a better move. See variation.]
;B[bm];W[cl];B[bl];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh];W[qf];B[pe];W[rd]
C[Marlix: I didnt see this comming

catch22: I think throughout the game you underestimated the power of White's strong position. Although White was initially behind in territory, he had built influence instead, which is worth just as much. 

Also note how all White's stones are connected, whereas you are split into five groups, which each need to be defended separately.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pb];W[rh];B[qe];W[re];B[rg]C[catch22: It should clear again that this does not work...]
;W[rf];B[ri];W[sg];B[nb];W[mc];B[kj];W[kk];B[jk]C[catch22: You should try to read out the result of your moves before playing them. In particular here, because the sequence is pretty much a one way street, you should be able to work out that it does not work, and therefore not play the move.]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[il];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[jm];B[kd];W[ke];B[bo]
;W[id]C[Marlix: Again I didnt see this.. now i had to resign in a few moves.]
;B[je];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb];B[eb];W[cb];B[hb];W[jc];B[ia];W[ja]
;B[ga];W[mb];B[kf];W[le];B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[sb]C[catch22: And here the game ends. All in all, an interesting game.

In summary, my advice is:

1) Try to improve your reading skills. Before playing your moves, make sure you've read the continuation. Only play it if it works out okay. Otherwise, refrain from playing the move. It may work later (with one or more other stones in place), or it could become a good ko threat later. Solving life&death and tesuji problems is a good way to improve your reading.

2) Don't be afraid to sacrifice. Do not try and save all your stones. Sometimes stones cannot be saved, or  not without paying too high a price. In this case, don't try to save these stones, but see instead if you can gain from giving them up.

3) Pay attention to strength and influence. You can attack severly if you are backed up by a powerful position, but otherwise you have to play more carefully. Similarly, if your stones are close to a strong position, you have to take extra care that there are no weakness that can be exploited. 

When you are ahead in territory, that does not necessarily mean that you are ahead in the game. Influence and strength is worth a lot as well (but may require good reading skills in order to be exploited effectively).]
