C[personally i would prefare a pincer at "a"  or "b", but moves are "c" and "d" could be  good too. The move you played is not  nessesarily bad, but have in mind that by  attaching opponents stones you strengthen  his position.
(Generally you attach when you want to  defend. Here you want to attack)]

C[this is what i meant in my previous  comment: white has taken profit in the  corner but black has strength in the outside  . this is more or less a fare exchange, but  me personally i would prefare not to make  black's life so easy in the beggining of the  game. White has to attack. Not to defend.  In this game white plays defensivly. If you  look at the position now, white has no good  targets for attack.]

;B[qp];W[oq];B[pn]C[now black has both taken territory and  great strength at the right edge. Of course  white got territory at the bottom edge but  what black got is worth much more. You  didn't make proper use of the wall you  build (marked stones).]
;W[qq]LB[gh:a]C[this is not the proper moment to take profit  here particularly when it is gote. Black is  given the chance to enlarge his moyo with  "a". White should play "a" himself. That  move would make use of the power white  has at the top.]

 "a" was nessesary. However if you play at  the area you did, then "b" is better.]

lets try to estimate the score: black has 7  points in the upper left + 14 points in the  upper right + around 20 points in the lower  right + 5 captured = 46 points  white has around 40 points in the bottom  edge   + 5 points komi = 45 points
the score (whithout calculating the left edge  and the upper edge where black and white  respectivly will make territory) is about  even.  Now if black got the chance to place a sto  ne  around thepoint where white just played  his territory at the left will be worth at least  35 points. He will be well ahead. White  must use his power at the upper part of the  board  so  a move around the point you  just played looks absolutely  nessesary if white wants to maintain any  chances.]

you are right about playing at the left edge,  but the marked stone is too far extention.  "a" would be better.
I said you are right if you look at the left  side alone. Looking at the whole board,  maybe a move around "b" would be better.]
