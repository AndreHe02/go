AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, my name is Michael ( around 24k on KGS).
I have played the black stones in this game against a 21k on KGS with 0.5 komi.


Thank you very much for having a look at this game.


If you are german, please comment in german.];W[dd];B[qn]C[I don´t know about fuseki, so I thought Q6 is ok, latter on extending with P11, or nearby]

I worried about missing the chance to extend on the right side.]

K17 is probably better because it's more solid.  However, that probably isn't that important right now...  You want to see how much you can keep on the right side and upper right corner.  What if you played n16 (peep)?  Here, watch the cut in a variation.]

False.  Play S14 so you can atari at t15 or t16 to connect.  No problem here.]

The right part of the group has the ability to make an eye, but I feared blacks actions to prevent me of making one there.
Now I see it is easy...

Yeah, this stuff is hard to see at first.  But you actually have several eyes .  the triangles are eyes that probably couldn't be taken away even if white wanted to, and if you thought you needed four, you can make two more at M13 and S12 (miai).

The circles may be trouble.  That corner is a famous well studied shape.  I believe on the side it's certain death, but in the corner you can always live?  I'd have to look it up to be sure.  It'd make me nervous though.  You have to sit there and read into that for like 20 minutes and hope you figured it out...]

;B[lp];W[sb];B[da]SQ[cb][ca][ba][bb][cc][bc][ac][ab][aa][bd]
C[no better ko threats?

It's going to be very hard to find a ko threat worth 25 or more.  this is not big enough.  You're not going to do more damage than the marked region... if that much ... so this threat is only worth 10 or 15, and your ko is worth 25 or so.]

This is a famously bad shape, called the empty triangle.  Try kosumi.]

;W[kn];B[ba]C[This is a zero point gote move.  Yose is all about finding the biggest move.  Sente moves are worth double.  If you must make a gote move, make sure it's worth a lot -- or at least more than zero.]

(;B[ds]C[absolutely stupid, I know...
In that moment I decided, not to play D2 because I thought, white can kill the group with B1.
Now I see, D2 would have made it live...

D1 was a black out...


These things happen.   C1 is hamete.  White hopes you'll make this mistake, and I find the move rather vulgar.]
;W[dr];B[aa];W[ac];B[rs];W[fh];B[eh];W[dj]C[zero point gote for white!]

Not necessary.   I'm not sure what you want to be sure about.  It did cost you one point though...]

Well, white probably should have won by only 7.5 or so ... assuming he's better at the end game.  So this game is maybe a lot closer without the trick at c1.  If you don't play any zero point moves the score is slightly better (4.5).   So I think it's white's game no matter how you look at it, but there's a lot of things you could have done in the middle game to make it so those end game points aren't even necessary.
