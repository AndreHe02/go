;B[oq];W[rq];B[dp]LB[mp:B][lq:A]C[Maybe this joseki is't complete?
how should i do?

reid: Yes, black is rushing a bit.  Normally black should extend to A or perhaps B in some situations (probably not with this board).

White's position is stronger than black in this corner, so an attack seems like a good idea.  White B is a common idea to try to enclose black.  Certainly black will be able to live, but he can expect only a few points of territory while white builds valuable thickness on the outside.  Black's R8 stone will suffer as a result of not completing the lower left joseki.]
;W[op]C[reid: White should aviod pushing from behind.  It only helps black to settle faster.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[mo]C[reid: Black claws his way up to the fourth line.  White is disappointed with this result.]
;B[lp];W[qj]C[i decided to attack

reid: But it's too early.  There are so many large areas still unclaimed that black can ignore this attack for now and leave it for aji.  It is difficult for white to find a move that completes the capture cleanly.]
;B[ol]C[reid: but black takes the bait :-)];W[oj]LB[qf:B][qg:A]
C[reid: Better for white to take a base with A or B.  A seems a bit better because then blacks two stones at R8 are left floating.]
;B[ml];W[qf]C[reid:  So now we can ask: is the exchange of P10 for black N8 a good exchange?  I think it helps black more than it helps white.  The three black stones are impossible to attack now.

Simply playing R14 (without the P10/N8 exchange) looks better.]
;B[nd];W[lc]C[don't sure where to play

reid: Yes.  That's something to watch out for.  R14 seems obvious, but then black's natural answer at O16 leaves white with no very good continuation.

In contrast, if white had played R13 instead of P10, and black defends the corner, then white has good attacking potential against the two black stones at R8.

One should always be thinking about what comes next, not just this move.]
;B[ic];W[oc]LB[nb:A][fc:D][rd:B][ce:E][le:C]C[reid: Too soon.  White does not need to rush to erase black's corner because he has both sides already undercut - he can slide either to A (O18) or B (S16), so black cannot expect much from this corner.

More natural would be to jump out to C.  Black wants to extend to D, but that is the wrong way to approach this corner - white's extension to E is natural and good.]
;B[od]C[reid: Ouch.  White helps black to attack his R10/R14 group.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[pf];W[qg];B[me]C[reid: WIth each move you play, you must ask "how can I use this stone in the future?"  Here, black plays a stone that does nothing for him: the white stones just run out, so there's no attack, and there is no territory between N15 and Q14.  The only way this move can be good is if white ignores it completely and let's black enclose his N16 group.

Instead, black should block at R15 to keep the corner (white S16 is large and sente), or he should do something to help his J17 stone.]
;W[le];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg];W[gc]C[is this good?

reid: Yes, this is very hard for black.  His last three moves only helped white.]
;B[je];W[lg];B[mi];W[jg]LB[kd:B][ld:C][he:A][lh:D]C[reid: K 13 may seem natural, but it's really too slow.  White can do better.

First, white should be confidant that his M15 stones are strong enough that they don't need reinforcment yet.  So white can play A to see how black responds.  He'll probably peep at B which white answers by connecting at C.  If black then jumps to K13, white D is natural.  If black doesn't connect, he'll find those cutting points will be a problem.  Black helps white to attack him.

The way to look at this is that white would like an excuse to peep at the N12 weakness.  Probing with A is one way to do that.  And A looks to the future too because it can help take territory on the left side.]
;B[if];W[ig];B[hg];W[hf];B[he];W[gf];B[ge];W[ff];B[fe];W[ef]
;B[kd];W[ld];B[ee];W[de]
(;B[fc];W[ed]LB[fb:A]C[reid: White helps black again.

Why doesn't white do the normal hane at A?  There is no doubt that white is thin, but if he successfully encloses black, black will have to spend extra moves to make eyes (at best).]
;B[ec]C[reid: The normal connection at F16 leaves less aji.]
;W[hh];B[df]
(;W[ce]C[reid: If you look at the variation on the previous move, we see that white wants to play at D16.  But after C15, if white ever plays on D16 his shape is terrible.  So C15 probably isn't the best choice.]
;B[dg];W[ei]LB[eh:B][fi:A]C[reid: This kind of loose capture is sometimes more efficient, but you must be careful not to leave bad aji behind.  For example, black A or B may be sente later.  White may have to spend an extra move to capture the H13 stone.  E12 seems a bit cleaner.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[cj];W[db];B[gb];W[dh];B[ci];W[ch];B[bh];W[cg]
;B[bg];W[cf];B[qe]C[reid: while this is still a very large move, the black stones on the left are urgntly in need of assistance.  The proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move".  There is nothing urgent about R15 - it's just territory..]
;W[rl]C[reid: Is white afraid of dying here?  Because this move is simply yose.

If white thinks R15 is sente, then he should have played S16 as reverse sente many moves ago.]
;B[rm];W[rk];B[pn];W[rr];B[pi];W[qi];B[lo];W[qn]C[i prevent of cutting at O5

reid: White would love for black to cut at O5.  It is much too small for either side to worry about.  If black plays O5, black happily takes sente somewhere else.

White may need to play S6 later to make eye space while threatening to connect, so R6 is aji-keshi (helps black to patch up his problem).]
;B[qm];W[mn]C[reid: There is no territory for either side here.  Bigger would be to take Q2 and secure the white group's life.]
;B[ln];W[fq]C[Where to invade?

reid: Launching an invasion like this is a bit like making a "cold call".  You have no help - the white stone is far outnumbered, and white will be lucky to get away with a small life.  Black will certainly solidify his nearby territory.

Instead, white should look for a group he can attack.  The black stones on the middle left side seem like the obvious target - they are the only black stones that don't have two eyes yet.

White is behind (he has almost no territory while black has lots), so he needs to try something drastic.  I'd try an invasion / attack at C6 and see what shakes out.]
;B[ps]C[reid: what is black thinking?  Sure, these white stones are attackable, but black H3 looks so natural!  This white group is an excellent source of ko threats that black is just throwing away!]
;W[rs];B[rn];W[ro];B[hq]C[reid: black used up two ko threats there.]
;W[hp]C[is this good?

reid: At this point, white is so far behind that very little is going to be outright bad :-)

Going by just territory, it's fairly close.  But white's F3 group will allow black to make more territory, while white has no prospects of increasing his.]
;B[ip]LB[iq:A]C[reid: Better for black to simply pull back to A here.  Hane makes a little bit more territory on the right, but it helps white to settle his group, which will hurt black's left side.]
;W[gp];B[dq];W[iq];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr];W[hr];B[io]LB[dk:A][cn:C]
[dn:B]C[may be this is very small

reid: Yes.  White J5 would be sente, but it's no big deal.  Black would be much better to atari at A or extend to B or C.  Since black seems ahead, C is safest.]
;W[er]C[i decide to live];B[dr]LB[dm:A]C[reid: Again, extending on the left side around A is better.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[ej];B[bk];W[cl];B[dl]C[reid: Oops - black has a mental meltdown here.

Probably black should simply hane at B9 instead of atari at D9 (two moves ago).  If white then connects the double-hane, black extends to B8.]
;W[bl];B[aj];W[bi]C[reid: better not to make this move until you are ready to kill the group.  It is aji-keshi.  Other moves (on the outside) my be exactly what white needs to kill the D4 corner group later - perhaps A7, for example.]
;B[bj];W[dm];B[el]
(;W[em]LB[cn:A]C[reid: Sente now, gote later.

Better to just play A now.  See variation.]
(;B[fl];W[cn];B[bf]C[reid: black's mental lapse ten moves ago allows white to get back into the game.]
;W[be];B[ai];W[bp]C[where to attck this group?

reid: This is fine.  Looks like the black corner stones should die.]
;B[bq];W[bo]LB[cp:A]C[reid: what?  Why didn't white play at A?  Don't you want to kill those corner stones?]
;B[br];W[cs]C[miss now?];B[ds]
(;W[eo]C[reid: OK, here is some fighting advise: don't make moves unless you have to.  In this case, you should ask yourself if black can get his corner group out.  If he plays at E5, white encloses with F6 (or other fairly obvious moves).  If black goes any further than E5, like to F5 of E6, white can still either enclose or cut off the corner.  So E5 is not neccessary.

If white thinks his enclosure isn't quite strong enough, he should look for ways to strengthen it that work in two directions.  For example, white F7 threatens serious damage to the four black stones at F8

Anyway, see the variation:];B[eq];W[fr];B[cp];W[hm]LB[hl:A]
C[i think to capture 4 black stones and win

reid: A is a better capturing move.  And it does a better job of reducing black's center influence.]
;B[hl];W[il];B[im];W[gm]LB[ik:A]C[reid: white helps the wrong stone!  It doesn't look like black can capture H6, so white should play something like A instead.]
;B[ik]C[reid:  At this point it's just the yose, so I will end my commentary here.  Still not clear who will win, but I think you can see that both sides had chances to put the game away but missed out for whatever reason.

I would say that both players should concentrate on avoiding unneccessary moves.  Stay focussed on what *must* be played next and don't get distracted by non-strategic (territorial) things too early.  There'll be plenty of time for territory in the endgame.

Remember the proverb: "play the urgent move, not the big move".

Watch out for aji-keshi.  Just because it's sente doesn't mean it's good.

Don't help your opponent - make him help you.
