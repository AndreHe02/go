C[Hi, i'm nik0, I started playing go very recently so i'd like
some advice on which of my moves weere bad, and why,
and so on :)
I play black in this game.

Even though i won this game by far, i noticed i did some
bad moves but i probably didnt even spot half of the bad
moves.

I would really appreciate some comments on my play.
Thanks !];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fp];W[eq];B[fq];W[fr]
(;B[hq]C[Was this joseki ?

*Quickly checks joseki dictionary* Hmmm... don't think so. Playing G3 is fine as a defence, so I can't see why you would need a joseki like this for this situation.]

(;W[nd];B[pf];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[ld];W[lc]C[Attaching to your opponent's stone like this is signaling that you want to fight. The general outcome of this is a cross-cut with lots of variations.]

;B[dh];W[di]TR[cf][df][dg][dh]C[This sequence  is hard on black, because suddenly you have to run/fight to keep your marked group from dying, and keep white disconnected. Still, there are quite a few ways to do this. I've included a few variations.]

(;B[eh]C[Or, if you are particularly worried about the fight to save your group, then, yes, this is the move.]
;W[ei]TR[fg]C[Playing at F13, as you did in the game, isn't the best move in this situation. It allows white to get a good move at F12, which leads to the threat of atari and a big fight, as you saw in the game.]

(;B[fg];W[fh];B[ef];W[gh]C["Urgent moves, then big moves."

Although a move on the bottom is big, you want to make sure your group is fine before you play away from the fight, even if this means giving white sente.]

(;B[nc];W[mc];B[md]C[White should have used their next move to play elsewhere. At this point, there isn't really a way to save his M17 group.

So, they should just take sente and be happy. :) Perhaps, later on, there will be a chance to save those stones. If white plays them now, they lose their stones and any chance of rescuing them later is gone.

This is a principle you might use a lot.];W[oc];B[nb];W[gb]

Well, technically, white should have resigned long before this, but, assuming that it's a friendly game and that both players don't mind continuing, white should play the ko.]

(;B[qq]C[P4 was a move that was too easy on white.

This move here, at R3, is trying to take the corner space away from white. Just as it's easiest to make territory in the corner, then the side, and lastly the center, it's also easiest to make life in the corner, then the side, and hardest in the center.

R3 would force white to make life on the side, and this is much harder for white to do.]

(;W[lf]C[Although black wants the fight to stay simple, white wants nothing more than for it to become complicated. If it does, he has a chance at life. If things continue as they are (stay simple), then black will win this fight. White, of course, doesn't want this.

Depending on what you do, white has a few options. Overall, however, this really is a deperate move. White's looking for anything that will save them. If black is calm at this point, he should be ok.]
))
(;B[oc]C[This is starting to steal white's eye space.

Remember - the more eye space you can steal from white on the side, the more white will be forced to try and live in the center, and it's a lot harder to live in the center.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob]
(;W[md]C[White wouldn't really play here. because, as you see here, N17 isn't really an eye, but a false eye.

A thing to remember here, though, is to protect the cut at L15. It'll be a lot harder for you to kill this group if your own group gets cut off as well.]
;B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[ka];B[ja]C[As soon as the liberties on the top line are filled, white has to fill back, as you see here. Therefore - false eye.]

;W[gb];B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[dc]C[Suddenly, all black has is life, while white has this nice wall facing towards the center.

Also, all white has to do to connect is play a net at J12. Even if white can't play the net, black's stone at H13 will have to run, and, if white follows, then white has a good chance of making life or connecting with a living group.

So. The point of all this being, don't use a one space jump where you can be cut!]

(;B[ec]C[Perhaps something like this. 

This gives you space on the edge, threatens to invade white's corner, and makes sure of the connection with your E14 group.

:) All desirable things.]))

(;W[bg]C[If white comes in under here, black's suddenly in a big pile of trouble.  Black will probably escape, but white will be able to gain a lot of territory while harrassing black. It's probably best just to defend, again, at B13. 

So far black's in front. There's no need to be too hasty. Make sure of your groups as well.]
