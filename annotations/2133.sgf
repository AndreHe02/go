;W[jp]C[I thought black getting this place would be too good to be true for him.

: K4 and Q10 are miai (you must take almost one of these two points)]
;B[ci]C[here i really did not know what to do.];W[bg]TR[db]
[cc]C[I decided the marked exchange would be bad if it did not give me any territory or settle my group.

: this move seems a bit defensive, I prefer to attack with a pincer at C8 (because the white group is strong)

: C8 is also an extension from the white lower left corner. It is twice good!

: try to find such dual purpose move (like attack while extend) and your strenght will encrease very hard.]
;B[ce];W[de];B[cb];W[bc]C[: you must block at B18];B[cg];W[cf]
;B[bh];W[be]C[: before this move atari at D13 is important because it destroy an eye shape

: B14 is better than B15 : remember white is strong in this area so no needs to look for eye shape.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[I was not happy with this result. Black looks to get a largish territory on the left side. My group in the upper left is settled, but is not doing anything. It would have to be useful in fighting later to be worth the trouble, which did not seem likely to me at this time.]
;W[nq];B[np]TR[jp]C[I do not understand this move by black. The marked stones ensures the safety of my stones and...

: It seems black want strength and influence to the right side of the board. It is a standard move

: don't forget the lower side can yet be invaded (H3, H4 or others.)]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[qk]C[This way he does not get too much compensation for making me much stronger on the lower side.

: to attack the lower right corner, R6 is the key point. R9 seems good too because it can extend to R6 or R12 or R14.]
;B[pm]C[: this move is not so good, because it does'nt attack strongl the white stone nor defend the corner]
;W[rm]C[: I prefer a larger extension R14 or R12 (more quiet).]
;B[qg]TR[rm]C[I expected black to defend his territory below, but instead he played a combined pincer and extension, which seems pretty good. I think the marked stone was a mistake.

: Black has a good idea: extends from the corner while attacking (don't forget dual purpose move are very strong)]
;W[pn]C[Black seemed to have a weakness here, so I thought I might give my stones a little strength while erasing some territory.

: this move seems not good : if you want to settle your group while grabbing some teritory, R11 is better.

: S6 seems also good. It threatens to take the corner];B[po]
;W[qn];B[mo];W[lp];B[on]C[: at this stage it seems black has a better position : more teritory and more possibilities to get teritory.

: The small white group on the right can be under attack

: So it seems important to invade in the upper right side at O17]
;W[fn];B[jn];W[ln]C[: ????

: Why do you put a stone at such a point it can be cut from its base?]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kn]C[Ouch, though it did leave some bad aji for black.]
;W[ho];B[lc]C[: an black get more toritory! good move for black.

: It seems now R17 is an urgent move for white];W[qc]C[: yes !!! good!]
;B[pc];W[pb]C[: R16 before is better];B[ob];W[rb];B[qd];W[rd]
;B[pa];W[qb];B[re];W[sd]C[: No! T16 is bad move, the proper move is T17 (as you can see with the following moves)]
;B[sb]C[: very good black move: it creates a Ko];W[qa]C[: No! the only move is atari at T17 starting the ko (followed by black S19, white T19)]
;B[se]TR[sa]C[I decided to wait a while with fighting a ko by playing at the marked spot. I figured it was ok if black played here, as I would then get 2 moves in a row elsewhere.I believe I should have lived unconditionally, so this result was pretty carelessly done of me. I considered resigning at this points as I was pretty demoralized by this affair.]
;W[ie]C[Black could easily build a huge moyo around here, so I set about to prevent that.]

;W[hl];B[jj];W[ii]TR[fd][gd][id][kd][ge][he][ie][le]C[I considered it likely that I would not kill at this time, but I thought I might settle the marked group while erasing much of the remaining potential for expanding blacks moyo by continuing the attack.]

C[I think perhaps I ought to have connected the marked group by playing G13..

: yes but ... what happens if blabk play G13?

: the center white group can be circled with no eye !!!];B[qo]
;W[ro];B[qm];W[rn];B[cj];W[fq]C[I had been worrying about an invasion on the lower side for quite a while, so I thought I would remove some aji around here. It seemed much more important than the couple of points black gets by capturing. Of course I also lose the connection.

: weak move];B[dk];W[ei]C[I think I should have been more worried about the cut at G14 than I was at this time.]

;B[mn];W[nm]C[: good sequence for white (destroying eye shape)]
;B[om];W[sr];B[sp];W[so];B[or];W[qp]C[: defending at O2 is better]

;B[os];W[ms];B[il];W[im];B[jm];W[ll];B[nl];W[ml]C[needless to say, I did not expect this result.]
;B[ki]C[I do not know what black was thinking here.];W[eg]C[From here on, I just wanted to end the game simply, since I was clearly ahead.]

;W[jc];B[jb];W[mc];B[mb];W[oe];B[if];W[hg];B[gj];W[hq]C[Better safe than sorry... :-)

: Why ? no neek of this move

: if you want to close your territory why don't you simply play J5 ?]
;B[bb];W[rf];B[qe];W[rg];B[sf];W[oc]C[: is white tired ?];B[od]
;W[qf];B[pe];W[sg];B[rh]C[Black resigned. I choose this game for review because it has all the elements of my usual games: I do not much know what I am doing in the opening and the middle game is ok. This game does not include an entire endgame, but I don't think I have much of a problem with that compared to me being a 7k.And really, thanks alot for taking the trouble to look this over! :-)]
