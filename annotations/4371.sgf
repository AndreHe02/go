C[Dear Reviwer,  I hope you you can give me new insights in this very beatiful game and feel free to comment every mistake or tesuji that I missed.

Thanks in advance,
JÃ¼rgen Suntinger


Hi, my name is Ruben Cornelissen, dutch 2-dan. I hope my review will be of use to you. I'm sorry for sending it this late.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq]C[Is this White move actually a mistake, or just a question of style? Becaus now Black can optimally approach the lower left corner which should work nicely with the upper left komoku of Black.

I thought that if I play the high approach now at D5, then my opponent maybe pincer me with the low pincer at C7, which (I think) settles the lower left corner very quickly for both sides and then White is free to attack my upper left corner, but then I choose the lower approach, which maybe is inviting the pincer even more ...

This move is not a mistake, it's just a matter of style. Numerous pro games feature this opening. 

What you say about a kakari in the lower left corner working together with a your stone in the upper left corner, this is not true. The direction of play of the stone in the upper left corner is towards the stone in the upper right corner, and not towards the left side. 

Furthermore, in case of a high approach against the lower left corner and a pincer at C7, you cannot tell what will happen. There are too many variations possible, which is why you cannot say that is settles the lower left corner.

See variations]
(;B[co];W[ed]C[But here my opponent approached my upper left side. I am still not sure when to tenuki in this early stage of the game in general, because every move is kind of severe ...

Nothing wrong, this is a normal game so far];B[df]LB[ec:A]C[This move is only seen once in a pro game, probably because nowadays pro's believe that this joseki gives away too many points, and maybe because they think that it is focused too much on the left side. I personally think that this is a good choice however

Most pro games continued with A instead of D14];W[cc];B[bc]
;W[dc];B[be];W[ic];B[ep]C[I felt very good for Black because the joseki in the upper left side is Sente for Black and now I was free to press at E4 which looks to work good with my upper strength.]

(;W[ff]C[Strange move, should I answer, or take the entire lower left corner?

Very bad move by White, responding to E4 with E3 is the only move here.

See variation]
(;B[fg]C[Bad style, it is not necessary to attach, you only make your opponent stronger. I would have played E3 immediately

See variation]
(;W[fr]LB[eq:A]C[Bad move, A is the only move here];B[op]
(;W[mp]LB[oq:A]C[I have doubts about this move. Because of White low position at F2, the lower side is more or less played out. As White, I would have played A 

See variation];B[on];W[qn];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[rr];B[kq];W[cn]
C[Here is a very ciritcal point of the game, because I wanted to use the strength of my upper left formation.

This move is horrible by White, here you get a big chance to get ahead]
;B[dn]C[Good move, D5 would also be very good, not giving your opponent any help]
;W[cm]
(;B[ck]C[This move looked very attractive to me, isn't it?

At first sight it seems good, using your strength. However, I think it is not really a good move. First of all, Black is much too thin now. Secondly, what you are doing now is playing from your strength, while you should do the opposite, namely playing away from it. See variation]

(;W[bo];B[cp];W[bp];B[cq]C[Running into, the opponents corner seemed to help me a lot, especially because this two groups have no base yet ...

Yes, Black is ahead by a lot now.];W[dm];B[en];W[dk]
(;B[dj];W[cj]C[This move shocked me at first, what is the correct answer?

Your moves seem good, taking the outside and taking sente]
(;B[ci]C[See variation]
(;W[bj];B[ek];W[dl];B[ej];W[iq];B[jo]LB[ko:A]C[Good move, in case you want to play safe you can play A. This puts less pressure on White however.]
;W[gp]
(;B[jr]C[Maybe I should have seald white in there, instead of trying to take his base there?

Yes, letting White live on a small scale seems better.

(;B[jn];W[in];B[jm];W[im]
(;B[fm];W[jl]C[Ouch, hane at the head of 3 stones is painful...]
;B[ln];W[ik];B[hl]C[Good kikashi];W[il];B[go]C[Bad kikashi, White can play tenuki]

(;W[fp];B[fo];W[eq]
(;B[bi]C[Here you missed an important tesuji, one which you should remember:]
;W[bk];B[nc]C[Big move];W[pl]
(;B[qe]C[Was it right to fully secure my upper right corner now? seems very big, but attacking something else in sente may be bigger?

See variation];W[qh]
(;B[pj]LB[qj:A]C[I am never sure wheather to invade on the fourth or on the third line. What is better in this situation?

This is a usually a very bad move here. If White just plays at A, then he is connected. This is a situation which you should remember. (this is also the most usual continuation if a player ignores a low one point pincer to a high approach move). However, in this case it is good.

See variation];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[pi];W[qk];B[pm];W[qm];B[ol]
;W[ll];B[pk];W[ql]C[Black gained thickness, but it is not really working very effectively due to the White stones in the centre, which are strong. Futhermore, you gave away cash, but since the invasion didnt seem possible, this can't be helped.]
