C[LoP: I think this game features many mistakes from both players. I played black but please review for both sides. I'd like to send it to my opponent too.
I put some questions that came up in the post game discussion into this file.]
;B[qd];W[ec];B[pq];W[od];B[dp];W[qo];B[ld];W[pg]C[Comment: white should play the P14 joseki instead of Q13, after this joseki, black can play the great move at R9]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[pd];B[qf];W[nf];B[og];W[qc];B[qe];W[pb]
;B[qk];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[rq];B[mp]C[LoP: After white approached at c6 I thought the low M3 might be better instead of N4?

Comment: this move is fine because black actually has some potential at bottom, M3 seems to be too passive in this situation]
;W[cn];B[dj];W[fq];B[eo];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[gp];W[bp]C[Comment: white should play E4 first becuase it's the shape point of black, if black play at D5 white can still play B4]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[gq];B[hp];W[cd];B[cf]C[LoP: Aiming for corner weakness. Maybe too far?

Comment: H3 is huge, if black played at H3 black would be winning]
;W[id];B[lf];W[if];B[ng];W[nc];B[ef]C[LoP: Passive?

Comment: H3 is sitll the bgieest move on board];W[ih];B[lh]
;W[ch];B[dg]C[Comment: black did not gain much from the fight, so I am thinking about the variation of black B16, white B17,D16,C17,then black E11

however, black can also simply play at E12, if white B14, blackB15,C15, B13,D14,C13,D13,black can cut at D12 with good shape]

;W[bl];B[bk];W[ck];B[bm];W[dl];B[cm];W[bj];B[al];W[fl];B[hi]
;W[hl];B[ii];W[gn];B[hq]C[Comment: the exchange between G6 and H3 was too good for black, white was playing dummy]
;W[jl];B[dc];W[dd];B[gc];W[fc];B[gd];W[ib];B[gb];W[kc];B[db]
;W[be];B[ed]C[LoP: Maybe black should play more forceful?

Comment: it's not a bad move because black is thick];W[af];B[lc]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[kb];B[mc];W[ke];B[le];W[kg];B[lg];W[gf];B[fd]
;W[kp]C[Lop: Turning point of the game. I didn't find a good play for black here, the result in the game was horrible for black.]
;B[kq]C[Comment: this is the worst move for black, I would rather play thick at F4]
;W[jq];B[jp];W[lq];B[kr];W[lp];B[lr];W[jo];B[ip];W[mq];B[mr]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[op]C[Comment: black lost at least 20 points]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[kf];W[jf];B[je];W[jh];B[he];W[ie];B[ml]C[lop: overplay?  O9 better?

Comment: O8 might be safer];W[ok];B[qm];W[om];B[pj];W[oj];B[oi]
C[Comment: black should play at N10 because the N8 stone is bigger than the Q13 stone]
;W[lk]C[lop: I was quite surprised how easy white got that stone. I guess now it's an easy win for white.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[ni];W[mj];B[bc];W[rn]C[LoP: Nothing really interesting in the late endgame. White wins by 3.5.

Comment: black played pretty well in the early game, but the fight at bottom shifted the game to white's side]
