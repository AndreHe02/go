;B[oq]C[jbriody [28k?\]: Biggest thing is to pay attention to your pieces liberties and thik ahead
Ed: The basic rule is always to make the biggest move. The hard part is knowing which is the biggest. In this early stage, moves should mark out territory with good (thick) shape. That means that moves should not be too far apart (thin), so that the enemy can break through, nor too close together (heavy), so that the enemy can make more territory in the same time.  
Later in the game one of the most important questions is whether attacking the enemy or defending against enemy attack is bigger.]

(;W[qd];B[co]TR[dq]LB[dq:A]C[The opening at the 3-5 point invites an attack at a.]
;W[dd]C[jbriody [28k?\]: See how both of mine are at 3-4 and 4-4?]
;B[qo]TR[qp]LB[qp:A]C[The point a secures the corner much better. In this formation, White can invade at the 3-3 point and make life.]
;W[dj]C[White is beginning to sketch out a large territory.]
;B[eq]C[labradors [29k?\]: Looking at it now, that was my mistake...I had thought I was playing on 3,4, but just didn't look closely enough.
jbriody [28k?\]: While your opening makes you use two stones to make the corners feel safe
labradors [29k?\]: First game on 19-line board, so things look a little different scale.
jbriody [28k?\]: If someone attacks either of my corners then I can either meet the attack play against it to limit where the other player can go]
;W[pk]C[Very large.];B[pm];W[je]C[White's territory is huge. Black has played much too tightly, and still has weaknesses in the corners.]
;B[nm]C[These four stones are much too close together. Black's formations are heavy, while White's are well-balanced and thick.]
;W[qm]C[A mistake.];B[ql];W[qn]C[Compounding the mistake. Continuing this fight gives Black prisoners and forces Black to build a powerful wall.]
;B[pn];W[pl];B[rm];W[rn];B[ro];W[sn];B[sm];W[so];B[sp];W[rl]
TR[rk]LB[rk:A]C[A mistake. Black can capture at the marked point.]
;B[qm]C[Too timid. There is no need to make this connection unless White threatens immediate capture.]
;W[rk]C[jbriody [28k?\]: Anyway--someone attack my side like this]

(;B[qk];W[rj]C[Crawling on the second line is a recipe for failure. Black's strong formation on the third line gains in influence at every step.]
;B[ri]TR[qj]LB[qj:A]C[No.The point a is correct. Black must try to reduce White's territory by invading with moves that cannot be cut off.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[pj];W[oj];B[ok]LB[pi:A]C[Never mind these two stones--invading again at a is much bigger.]
;W[ol];B[nl]TR[nk]LB[nk:A]C[Playing at a instead of the given move captures three White stones.]
;W[nk];B[om];W[ok];B[nj]TR[lk]LB[lk:A][pi:B]C[An invasion should stay away from enemy stones at first, and also maintain a way to connect to the base. A move at a is much better, and don't forget the solid invasion at b.]
;W[mk]TR[kl]LB[kl:A]C[White will try to extend a wall across the board. Black needs to get into the center, perhaps at a.]
;B[ml];W[oi];B[mi]TR[lk]LB[lk:A]C[No. Bend around White with the hane at a.]
;W[pi];B[lk];W[fp]C[An excellent move to reduce Black's territory. This is called striking at the shoulder. Black needs to wall off the bottom, allowing White to build a wall in the center.]
;B[fq];W[ep]LB[gp:A]C[White would do better to play at a, and push even further across, rather than allow Black to block toward the middle.]
;B[gp];W[dp];B[do]TR[cl]LB[cl:A][dq:B]C[A stone at a would make space, which is what this black stone needs most. The point b is also good.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]TR[bn][bo]LB[bn:A]C[Black should capture the marked white stone instead by playing at a.


Black should capture the white cutting stone instead by playing at a.]
;W[bn];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn]LB[dm:A]C[The three black stones are threatened, and have no room to escape. This move is not effective.]
;W[en];B[dn]C[At this point, Black should abandon these stones.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[el];W[fm];B[gn];W[cm];B[go];W[fl];B[gq]
C[Unnecessary.];W[ek]C[jbriody [28k?\]: Your last move was probably unecessary
labradors [?\]: thanks.];B[gm]TR[lk]LB[ij:A]C[Rather than build this tight wall, Black should expand from the marked stone in two-space or three-space leaps, for example at a.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[cn];B[dr];W[ap];B[br];W[gl];B[hl]C[This stone is a good starting point for invading White's territory. White needs to block it.]
;W[ll]LB[kq:A]C[Pointless. An invasion at a, though not really sound, would have some open space to work with.]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[km];W[mj];B[ni];W[lj];B[kk];W[ln];B[kn];W[lh]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[mo];W[nh];B[nn]C[Unnecessary.];W[li];B[mm]C[Unnecessary. Black still has the opportunity to invade through the center.]
;W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[jh];B[ik];W[hk];B[il]
;W[hj]C[White has completed a wall across the board. Black has lost the chance to invade from the base at the bottom.   The territories are approximately Black 80, White 180]
;B[jk]C[An endgame move worth only one point. Invade instead.]
;W[ji]LB[cc:A]C[White should strengthen the corner and sides against invasion at a and in other open spaces.]
;B[hm]C[Unnecessary.];W[gj];B[dq]C[Filling a dame point has no value.]
;W[do]C[Unnecessary.];B[aq]C[Worth a point.];W[ao]C[Worth a point.]
;B[si]C[No.];W[sh];B[sk];W[sj]C[labradors [?\]: Howdy, George.
jbriody [28k?\]: I don't think you'll be able to see his responses during the game
labradors [?\]: oh.  okay.];B[ri]TR[sl]LB[sl:A]C[Black cannot capture these stones. Connecting at a is much better than throwing away a stone.]
;W[sl];B[qh]TR[cc][cf][gc][mc]LB[cc:A][cf:B][gc:C][mc:D]C[Better invasion points are marked. Invasions should not be up against enemy stones, but should have as many liberties as possible, and some space to expand into. The 3-3 point invasion is worth about 20 points.]
;W[qg];B[oh];W[ph];B[og];W[of];B[ng];W[mh];B[cc];W[cb];B[db]
TR[dc]LB[dc:A]C[The marked point is better.];W[bb];B[bc]TR[cd]
LB[cd:A][dc:B]C[Black needs to expand away from the White stones toward open space, or connect.]
;W[dc];B[eb];W[bd];B[ac]TR[cd]LB[cd:A]C[Run toward open space, not toward the edge.]
;W[ab];B[ca];W[ad];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gc];B[fa]TR[gb]LB[gb:A]
C[Expand. The Black stones have no eye.];W[gb];B[gd];W[ge]LB[hd:A]
C[An error. White should play at a.];B[ga];W[ha];B[hb];W[ib]
;B[ia];W[hc];B[ic];W[ha];B[ja];W[fb];B[hd];W[ea];B[jb];W[hb]
C[Quite a reversal. Now the White stones are surrounded and have no eye.]
;B[fa];W[ed];B[ga]C[Black is alive, and has gained about 30 points (9 in territory, and 20 in space taken from White).]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[gc];B[ha];W[cd];B[da]C[No. Expand across the top.]
;W[id];B[hb]LB[mc:A]C[Not needed. Expand at a.];W[he];B[hc]
;W[kb];B[kc];W[lb];B[lc];W[mc];B[jc]LB[md:A][le:B]C[No need to connect yet. Expand at a or b.]

[ss]C[jbriody [28k?\]: Good game--you almost made the comeback in the upper corner
labradors [29k?\]: good game...any comments?
labradors [29k?\]: at least I lived, and got a little territory up there.
jbriody [28k?\]: Personally I think your opening is too wide--makes it hard to defend and you end up spending two moves to secure the corners
jbriody [28k?\]: Playing at 3-4 or 4-4 is more normal
labradors [29k?\]: Okay...I'll go back and review.
labradors [29k?\]: anything else?])

(;W[po])
(;W[qo]C[jbriody [28k?\]: but if you start out at the 3-5 line someone is likely going to attach at the other 3-5 point
labradors [29k?\]: got it.

jbriody [28k?\]: see you around
