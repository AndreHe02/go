(;W[dq]C[>this white move made me happy
yes, it is wrong, W build a wall, but has no stone near K4 and he ends in gote...]
;B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em];B[jq]C[>not sure if this is the best place. L3 better?

I think so, but only marginally... with K3 it is easy for W to decide which side to play on (M3) since playing H3 would be
too close to his thickness. With L3 it is a bit harder to decide.]

Looks natural, but it doesn't really threaten to cut D6 - maybe F5 possible?]

(;B[cj]C[>This is questionnable. I think there exist better places to attack. Maybe one line higher?

I think this is the correct point on the left side, but I think it is preferable to play something to strengthen the other group first.]
;W[ek];B[dn]C[This move is bad (aji-keshi), it just forces W to connect and indirectly makes G6 connection a little weaker.]
;W[en];B[fo]C[>I think I shouldn't have played these moves.

Correct.];W[eo];B[jo];W[io];B[in];W[jr];B[di]C[>E11 or some other move better?

E11 looks slightly better to me. But I would still be worried about the lower side B group, maybe L7 or something is neccessary?]
;W[gl]
(;B[il];W[jn];B[im]
(;W[kn];B[ij]C[Maybe a bit soft, F10 instead is a very severe play. J10 has the benefit of being simple and good.]
;W[fi];B[fh]C[>bad move I think. F14 would have been better.

Hard to find a good play for B here. Maybe tenuki and play R6? I don't like F14, seems to attack with no purpose.]
;W[gi];B[gh]C[This push only makes matters worse for you... You should try to avoid this kind of push from behind. And especially when you are cutting up your own position (H11 cuts you in two)]

I think yes (see variation).]

No, you should play like you did in the game.];W[eg];B[cg]C[>Any other possibilities here?

No, this seems to be the best you can do.];W[gg]C[At least you have sente.]

Hard to say, I feel like I would have blocked in the other direction because of K12 stone heading into the upper side territory.]
