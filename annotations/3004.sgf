AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Alex: I had black in this game.  I think I got off to a good start, but played a few slack moves later on.  Any suggestions you can make are very welcome--thanks for your help.

-----

Your main issue is that you focussed on surrounding territory in the upper right and lower center, rather than use your strength to attack the white groups.]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[df]LB[de:A][cf:B]C[This move is unusual.  It is usually at A or B.]
;B[jd];W[lc];B[nc];W[le];B[jf];W[lg];B[jh];W[jb]C[Alex: This surprised me: I thought white would keep running into the centre.

-----

Making a small base is reasonable.  The prior white jumps threatened to surround your group, but one more jump does not.]

(;B[li]LB[ic:A]C[Playing at A is safe, and keeps up the pressure.  But your move in the center is also good.

White is aiming to play on the right side, you should also condoer a move there.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[hf]LB[id:a]C[Alex: I'm trying to learn how to make light, flexible shapes; but this got me into trouble later.  Is it better to connect solidly at 'a'?

-----

Yes, just connect.   Play lightly like this when you are trying to live with a weak group.  The idea is that you can sacrifice a stone or two to make the whole group live.  In this posiiton, your group is already stable, since it has escaped to the center, and you want to attack the white group.  In order to attack, you need to avoid leaving your own stones short of liberties, since it gives him forcing moves.]
;W[pf]C[This jump by white is a little bit too far to be connected.  You should think about splitting white.]

(;B[qf]C[This lets white stabilize his larger group easily.  You could think about attacking instead.  Your corner is not in danger.

It looks like you are trying to take corner territory rather than attacking the write groups.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[pg]LB[li:A]C[Alex: This is the sort of position where I have trouble making decisions: it seems as though there are lots of big points, and I can only play one of them!  What would you recommend?

-----

I like the move you chose.   It works well with A to make potential in the center.]
;B[jp];W[qn];B[pl];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pn]C[This move is wrong, since you can cut.]

(;B[on]C[Alex: Maybe I should have played R5 instead?  (see variation)

-----

Yes, push and cut.];W[om]
(;B[nn]C[No.  You have to cut here.];W[pm];B[nm];W[nl];B[ml]
;W[mk];B[ol];W[nk]
(;B[ll]LB[pl:A][ol:A]C[No.  Cut and take the corner with sente, then come back to this move.

Since you decided to sacrifice the stones at A, you should get full value for them.]
;W[qo];B[lk]C[You gave up a huge side and corner here.  White has caught up a lot.]
;W[cn]C[Alex: Here again I had trouble deciding what to do.

-----

It looks like you are just trying to surround territory.  On the right this caused you to give up a lot.   In the upper right corner you missed the chance to separate white.

You need to think about attacking white since you are so much thicker.]

(;B[en]C[Alex: This is consistent with my building up a moyo, but I think it lets white get too much territory.

-----];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[dl]C[Alex: This seemed like a good idea at the time, but soon this shape starts looking thin.  Is there a better move?

-----

Yes.  Just play the usual pincer earlier, and you will be thicker.

At this point, this shape is a little odd.];W[jq]C[This is the problem with building a single huge territory.  When the opponent comes in you have to kill him.  It is usually better to take your territory while attacking.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[ip]C[Alex: Should I try to be more severe here?

-----

This is severe.  Block on the side away from your thickness is correct, and so is playing thickly so he has no forcing moves.]
;W[kq]
(;B[kp]C[This looks like a mistake.  He has no where to go in the center. Play this move if you plan to let him live small.  Or you can play to kill him (see variations).

To decide, count the score each way.  If you are confident you can win if he lives small, play this way.  If you will lose when he lives, you have to play try to kill him.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[lq];B[mp];W[gq]LB[oj:B][do:C][eh:A]C[Alex: Now I need to defend against E5?

-----

No.  When you decide to let him live inside your framework, you must end in sente.   You need to make some big move like A or B, and worry about your 3 stones later.

Or play C.]
(;B[dn];W[di];B[oj]C[Good];W[fj];B[gk]C[The territory you have been trying to build has become pretty small.]

(;W[mi];B[ni]C[Good]
(;W[mb]C[Alex: White could make a ko by playing M10 instead?  (see variation)

-----

Or you could cut and take away all the edge territory.];B[nb]
;W[hi];B[kj];W[fk];B[fl];W[cm]C[This is very big.  You needed to find time to make this move sometime earlier.]
;B[gl];W[gp];B[go];W[lp];B[lo];W[id]C[Alex: What is the best way to defend here?

-----

Your alternative move.]

;B[np];W[eh];B[cj];W[bi]C[Alex: White's shape here looks thin, but I couldn't find a good way to attack.  Do you have any suggestions?

-----

Too late now.];B[dg];W[eg];B[qi];W[rf];B[re];W[rh];B[sf];W[sg]
;B[rg];W[hk];B[hl];W[rf];B[se];W[ci];B[mf];W[lf];B[ne];W[ng]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[lh]C[Good, but you should have cut off these stones a long time ago.]
;W[rj]C[Alex: Now is there any way for me to kill some white stones?

-----];B[ri];W[si];B[ql];W[nf];B[me];W[rl];B[rm];W[qk];B[qm]
;W[pi];B[pj]C[Alex: This is where I started to run short of time and make silly mistakes.  This move and the next one are just a waste of two ko threats; I should just attack the group below?

-----

You have to play here to connect.];W[oi];B[nj];W[qj];B[so];W[qr]
;B[pr]
(;W[sp]
(;B[rp]C[Alex: This was a mistake.  I think I can kill by playing T6 instead: see variation.

-----

I think you are right.];W[sn]C[Alex: I should leave this alone now and play somewhere else.

-----]
(;B[rn];W[ro]C[Alex: My estimate of the score now is:
Black: centre, 30 points; top right 20 points, total 50
White: top left, 25-30 points, bottom left 10, bottom right 9, top 12, right side 10, total about 70

so I need to do something drastic to win from here.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to count the score carefully during the game, and I thought it was close, so I just carried on playing ordinary endgame moves.

There's no need for you to review the endgame, unless you have any suggestions for how I could turn things around.

-----

Just look at how small your lower center territory ended up. You gave up a lot on the right edge to get it, and even though you took all the right side territory away, you still didn't get enough.]
