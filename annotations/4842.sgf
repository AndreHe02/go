C[MattScott [1d\]: hello
hiromt [1k\]: hello];B[pc];W[dd];B[qp];W[co];B[jp]C[MattScott [1d\]: slightly unusual fuseki]
;W[pe]LB[qi:B][ph:A]C[Donal: White 6 is a difficult way to play, because the black  pincer at A is ideal. White B is a much easier way to play, blocking Black's double extension.]
;B[ph];W[oc]LB[ob:A][pd:B][od:C][ne:D]C[Donal: This is a very dangerous move! At best, Black will play at A, and White's group will be heavy and subject to attack. But Black might play at B or C, and the variations are extremely complicated. White should simply play at D.]

(;B[ob];W[od];B[nc]TR[ph]LB[nb:A]C[MattScott [1d\]: I think this is bad here, I can settle my stones and the pincer will have lost it's meaning
MattScott [1d\]: Both cuts seem to lead to good results
Donal: That's right. Black should just extend at A.]
(;W[nb];B[mb];W[pb];B[na];W[qc]C[Donal: Even so, Black has a double extension from the lower right corner, and it's his move, so he's doing great. So White's strategy was poor.]
;B[dq];W[ep]LB[fp:A][gp:B][do:C][cj:D][dp:E]TR[jp]C[MattScott [1d\]: this seems the only option here and works well with the plan to build a moyo on the left

Donal: I don't agree. Black should probably have played 18 himself. With 17 he is trying to get more than he deserves. I think White should play A or B. Black will counter with C, White will still get his moyo, and Black won't have as much secure territory.

Donal: The joseki beginning with white 18 is usually played when there is already a white stone at D and no black stone on the right. Both players need to vary their moves in accordance with the surrounding stones.

With the surroundings changed like this, you need to read out what will happen. With the extra black stone, for example, maybe Black could push at E and cut. At least you have to consider the possibility. And Black should naturally consider this option to make best use of this extra stone. The "joseki", if slavishly played out, would make this stone totally wasted.]

(;B[eq];W[fp];B[gq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[hr];W[gp]
(;B[gs]C[MattScott [1d\]: this is not joseki
MattScott [1d\]: but the joseki is undoubtedly bad for black as it leaves him very overconcentrated
MattScott [1d\]: Which is why i played it
Donal: In this case, Black should not jump at 21, he should push once more, then play elsewhere, for example on the left side. As it is, he allowed White to retain sente.]
;W[hq]LB[er:A]C[MattScott [1d\]: this is an attempt to punish black for his departure from joseki
Donal: It's only a punishment if you follow through and cut at A and win the ko. Basically since you haven't got any ko threats, the original atari at 28 is probably premature. You can always wait a few moves to play there, since Black can't take the time to play there himself.
Actually, Black 27 may have been good because it takes advantage of the extra black stone on the right.]
;B[iq];W[gr];B[fc]LB[ci:A]C[Donal: Black A might have been a little better.]
;W[er];B[gq];W[cq]TR[fr]C[MattScott [1d\]: There are no ko threats at the moment
MattScott [1d\]: maybe I should have left the position till more ko threats appeared
MattScott [1d\]: with more ko threats I could capture the triangle stone and my result would be wonderful.
Donal: Black makes a lot of thickness here, so White didn't gain much.]
;B[hp];W[dr];B[cf]LB[do:2][eo:3][dp:1]C[MattScott [1d\]: It's hard to evaluate results like this where one side has got a good formation at the expense of a tenuki and in gote. I have taken the bottom left corner, eliminated the threat of the 1,2,3 cut, but had to allow a double approach move on my hoshi stone
MattScott [1d\]: I think this is fine for white
Donal: I think this position is very good for Black.. It's difficult now for White to invade the right, and Black also got two moves against the upper left corner.]
;W[fd]TR[lc]C[MattScott [1d\]: this attachment is in keeping with my plan to build a moyo on the left, although it makes black stronger at the top and the possible attack at the triangle is slipping away.
Donal: The modern approach is to attach on the other side. Seems illogical, but check how the actual game turned out.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[dc]LB[ec:A][gc:B]C[Donal: White 42 used to be considered joseki, but it's actually good for Black because he has a lot of secure territory and White's thickness is not so good. White should play at A instead, let Black connect at 42, and then cut at B making White thickness That's why you should attach on the other side, because that is the efficient way to make a moyo there.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[ed]
(;B[gb]LB[gc:A][db:B]C[MattScott [1d\]: again, not joseki
Donal: Black 47 seems OK to me. If instead Black A, then white cuts at B, which is not as good for Black.]

(;W[ci];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[ge];W[ff]C[MattScott [1d\]: this result seems bad
MattScott [1d\]: but I see no alternatives for white];B[pk]
C[MattScott [1d\]: what other options does white have here?
Donal: White's mistakes were that he allowed Black to get a double extension from the lower right, he tried to play ko without ko threats, and he played a poor joseki at the upper left. It's hard to win now.]

(;W[oq]LB[oo:A][pn:B][nm:C]C[MattScott [1d\]: this seems like the last possible invasion point, even though blacks thickness opposite is imposing
Donal: You have to play lighter here. Maybe white A, black B, white C?]

(;B[pq];W[pr]C[MattScott [1d\]: this is a bit unusual, I was trying to get a lighter formation]
;B[qr];W[pp];B[qq];W[po]LB[np:A]C[Donal: Black A here seems scary. White is pushing his luck. Black's stones in the corner are already alive, so he won't need to waste noves to defend them.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[np];B[pm]C[MattScott [1d\]: I was happy with this result
MattScott [1d\]: in sente too
Donal: Yes, Black should have attacked White rather than just defending territory. White would have had big problems.]
;W[lc]C[MattScott [1d\]: probably bad, I just wanted to see what black would do]
;B[md]LB[ke:A]C[Donal: It wasn't that bad, but better to follow it up with white A.]
;W[gf];B[ej];W[gj]C[MattScott [1d\]: I have to cap surely
Donal: Yes, but the idea is to chase Black and simultaneously erase his moyo on the right, while being careful that the white group on the lower right doesn't die.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[hj];W[gi]C[Donal: White 76 doesn't seem so good. Better to extend on the other side.]
;B[hl];W[fk];B[ik];W[fl]C[MattScott [1d\]: this seems alright
Donal: Black has so much thickness now that the lower right white group might die. This is not enough for White.]
;B[nr];W[or];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq]LB[mn:A][om:B][nm:C]C[Donal: Black 85 may not be needed. How about black A, white B, black C?]
;W[om];B[ol];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm];B[hf]LB[ln:A][oo:B]C[Donal: Black should play A or even B.]
;W[hg];B[if];W[nd];B[mc];W[me];B[le];W[rh]C[MattScott [1d\]: this is the ooyose now]
;B[mf];W[qm];B[pl];W[rk];B[rl];W[qj];B[pj]
(;W[ql]C[MattScott [1d\]: I think on reflection that this is a very bad idea]
;B[rm];W[qi]LB[ig:A][hh:B]C[Donal: Black should play A or B. He can potentially make a lot of territory in the center.]
;B[qk]C[Donal: Capturing was not as big.];W[pi];B[oi]
(;W[oh]C[MattScott [1d\]: the losing move?];B[og];W[nh];B[qg]
C[MattScott [1d\]: Somehow I overlooked the connection in sente]
;W[rf];B[ng]C[MattScott [1d\]: this is disasterous];W[ig]C[Donal: But White got to play 18 which is big. This is because Black took time out to capture two stones.
