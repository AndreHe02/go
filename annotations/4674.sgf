;W[qj]MA[eq][qn]C[JR: Nothing terribly wrong so far but a little bit passive. I  would prefer a closer appraoch to one of black's stones]

(;B[ql]
(;W[qn]C[Kyoushu: Maybe pincing wasn't good enough. It resulted in a large wall for black and an even larger moyo?

JR: R6 is a bit small at this stage. Black is unlikely to play in the region again soon so the opportunity will exist in the future

Many other options seem better];B[pn]
(;W[qp]C[JR This does not seem ideal];B[po];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr]
;B[or];W[rr]
(;B[qm];W[rn];B[ol]C[JR Black should probably have taken sente instead of playing this move

Although black has a wall its not really facing anything. It would be much better for black to have a stone around K4]

(;W[qg]C[JR It does not seem that important to be supporting / defending the R10 stone]
;B[jd];W[fd]C[JR: This does nothing to really pressure the K16 stone so it is gote.]
;B[md]C[JR I do not think black had to do this.

Also if black is wanting to make a base for these stones they would be better on the third line.]

(;W[ep]C[JR Taking sente to approach is good. Perhaps more towards the centre however]

(;B[eq]
(;W[fp]C[JR This is just wrong. you're inviting black to make territory]
;B[fq];W[gp];B[gq]
(;W[hp]C[Kyoushu: I just kept pushing. OK reduce of the moyo?


JR : no, the moyo wasn't really there yet so you're giving black territory. You need to nane some time]
;B[ef]C[JR I've no idea why black did this];W[cf];B[cg];W[df]
;B[dg];W[ee]C[Kyoushu: Here I tried to form good shape, but again, black makes a wall, maybe not so good for me.

JR: White got a big corner, seems OK  to me.];B[ff]
(;W[hc]C[JR: This is not necessary to defend the corner. 

OK if its an attack on the 2 stones to the right. Otherwsie tenuki]
;B[fe];W[ed]C[Kyoushu: E16 wasn't necessary?

JR NO I think E16 was needed to preserve all the crner. Omitting it was posible but black would hurt the corner.]
;B[qc]
(;W[qd]C[JR

This gives black a lot. Blocking the otgher side is more aggressive.

The 2 black stones are high and so a little vulnerable. H17 looks under them. 

Its a great time for white to form a wall and then attack.]

C[JR : white has done really well over the past few moves.  Black has been following white around.

Not sure about this move however. If white wants to move into the centre I ,prefer H15. It makes some attack on the stones to the right.]

JR. Not a huge amount.

White could just say the centre group is alive and tenuki. P10 is quite big.]

JR:  Well white did Ok in the end but black was much better in the opening.

White should be more willing to invade and fight. Also take sente more often, especially in the opening. There are so many options to exchange your gain in one palce for a loss that may occur if you ignore the opponents move.]
