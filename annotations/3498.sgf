C[Babibo : hello reviewer !
I'm 5k from France and here I'm black.
White is japanese, and has a japanese style : very slow, not deeply calculated, but with good positional judgement.
White built a big moyo, that i did not manage to invade. I would really like you to tell me how I should have prevented the building of this moyo.
After that, white was easy on me. I think he could have invaded me plenty of times but he did not, probably because he knew he had won.

You'll find questions in the commentaries, but feel free to make your own comments. I may not know well my weaknesses.

Thank you very much for your time !];B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]
;B[qe];W[oq];B[qk]LB[jc:A][jd:B][qm:C]C[Babibo :is it the biggest move ?
Was it a mistake for white not to answer ?

PC: I slightly prefer 'a' or 'b', as they're extensions in the most important direction from your shimari and extensions from your star-point stone.

White is correct not to answer your move directly (e.g. at 'c'), as that would allow you to get 'a' or 'b' in addition to your extension on the right.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[gc];B[ec]TR[lc]LB[df:A]C[Babibo : this attack from both sides is seen quite often in my games and usually, white spends a move to reinforce her group.

PC: This is certainly playable. The other option is to strengthen your corner with a move like 'a', looking to play E17 later.]
;W[cf]
(;B[hd]LB[df:A]C[Babibo : probably a mistake. I really wonder how I could have attacked, or even if it was a good idea to attack.

PC: See the variation for one idea using a leaning attack, beginning with 'a', to strengthen your stones before attacking the White stones on the top edge.]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[he];B[gb];W[ge];B[id]LB[df:B][hb:A][ie:C]C[I know, the shape is terrible... I wanted to try.

PC: This is greedy, allowing White to weaken your corner. Better to just connect at 'a', threatening 'b' or 'c'.]
;W[fb];B[hb];W[fc];B[ie];W[db];B[eb];W[ea]C[In this sequence, white is too mild]
;B[cb]
(;W[ca]LB[cc:C][dc:A][ed:B]C[PC: Why not White 'a' Black 'b' White 'c', leaving Black with no eyes and no territory in the corner? If Black answers 'a' at 'c', the result is still good for White (see variation).]
;B[dc];W[da];B[ba];W[fa];B[bc]
(;W[if]C[See variaion for the attack white could have made]
;B[jf];W[ig];B[gg]C[Babibo : I often see this kind of plays in 6d games. Don't know if it is a good idea. I plan to play L14 anyway]
;W[jg];B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[mh];B[dg];W[fg];B[df]C[Babibo : wow I'm safe !]
;W[gh]C[Babibo : From now, I feel like white played much better than me. Very slow, but very thick. White is Japanese, in fact.

PC: At this point the game looks good for you. While White has influence it doesn't compensate for all your territory at the top, and it's partly negated by your stones on the left.]
;B[fq]LB[iq:A]C[PC: A splitting move at 'a' might be better here, as it's harder for White to get a severe attack.]
;W[hq]C[Good move from white, I think.

PC: Yes.]
(;B[cq]LB[fo:A][hp:B]C[PC: Anothe possibility to contest White's influence is the contact play at 'b' (see variation).]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[ok]
(;B[qn]LB[np:D][ol:A][pl:B][pm:C]C[PC: This low, territorial move falls in with White's plans. Some other possibilities are 'a', 'b', and 'c', which can lead to fighting (see variations). Perhaps the best idea, though, is to ignore White's last move and start erasing the moyo, e.g. with 'd'.]
;W[on];B[dn];W[en];B[em]LB[hn:A]C[PC: Here you're making it more difficult to reduce White's moyo and staking the game on being able to make enough territory to compensate. This isn't actually an unreasonable strategy: you have significant territory on the top and can make more on left and right. The alternative is to try to live inside White's moyo, e.g. starting with 'a'.]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[gm]
(;B[gn]LB[co:A]C[PC: This is risky. More consistent with the strategy of competing on territory is to play 'a' to fix your cutting points and let White worry aobut the cut at G6.  This should give you time to surround the left-hand side - see variation.]
;W[gl];B[go];W[fp];B[fo];W[eo];B[gp];W[dm];B[fk]
(;W[fr]C[Babibo : Definitely mild. See variation

PC: Right.];B[co];W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[dl];W[dk];B[cl];W[fj]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[ir]C[Babibo : This was suppose to be kind of sente]

(;W[hr]C[PC: You got away with it :-).];B[mq];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq]

(;B[mo]TR[kr][lq]LB[lr:A][nq:B][op:C]C[PC: If you want to play this jump then you should do so without playing th exchange of the two marked stones. Continuing at 'a', perhaps after Black 'b' White 'c',  is more consistent with that exchange and looks to give you a chance of getting two eyes - see the variation for one possible sequence.

PC: This move looks OK (though 'a' is also very big of course), but it doesn't seem to give you enough to win. However, I can't see a good alternative here. Trying to take sente (or a larger area) by playing 'b' doesn't help - see variation.]
