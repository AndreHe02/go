C[Hi! I played as black in this game.
My nick is wjzz and I"m now 12k on KGS
I lost by 8,5, althrought i was thinking that i was winning :-(
I would like to know where did i went wrong and on which part of the game i should work the most!
 Thanks from advance for your help!

I would like you to make comments for black, but if there is anything about white play that is important i would be grateful if u told me what ^__^


[lf\] Hello, I am Lefrog, and I'll prefix all my comments with [lf\]. 
Overal I think you are playing well, are showing a good sense of the game flow, some sense of timing, and I especially liked the way you pulled out your group on the left side (_the_ black weak group). Let me know if you feel that you need more information, or more details.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq];W[hp];B[eo];W[dn];B[cq]C[I'm not sure about this move...


[lf\] this move is actually part of a joseki. The white response is the one that is not correct. I am showing a simple joseki in variation]

(;W[dp]C[...and this ...];B[dq]C[...and this as well. Could you show a good joseki for this situation?]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn]
(;B[gn]C[[lf\] This is not necessary (see variation)];W[fm]
;B[gp]TR[fm][gn]C[[lf\] I think this exchange is not necessary, it is sort of aji keshi (it destroys potential). Black in the future cannot play E7 as a sente move for example. See variation for a more "open" ending.]
;W[nq];B[po]LB[kq:A]TR[nq]C[i was thinking about a pincer at 'a' instead. would that be better?

[lf\] it could be, it's a matter of choice. Still, I think White is in a tight spot. Here, black makes territory on the right, which can be considered a good exchange. The marked white stone is not out of trouble yet.]
;W[kq];B[fc];W[ee]C[Is this called the "takemiya kosumi" ? anyway, i didnt know how to respond it :-(

[lf\] this move is made possible by the white thickness at the bottom it seems. I think black should not be too nervous, there is still room for invasion later on, but the focus should be stabilisation.]
;B[dc]LB[ic:A][jc:B][id:C]C[[lf\] this way, the white moyo becomes more solid. I would not force white to solidify his position here, I"d play at A or B or C]
;W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[jc]TR[cb][db][cc][dc]C[[lf\] now is the time to challenge the marked moves : were they profitable to black ? to white ? This shape with the white hane (D16) at the head of two black stones is very very bad for black. It is not efficient at all.]
;W[gd]C[[lf\] this feels very good for white to play.];B[gc]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[di]C[[lf\] I think that here, you can see that if you had the possibility of playing E7 in sente, that invasion could be more profitable.]
;W[dk]
(;B[dg]C[[lf\] this feels cramped and tight. maybe using the somewhat sente move of C15 would yield an interesting follow-up.]
;W[df];B[cj];W[ck];B[bj];W[cg];B[eg];W[ch];B[ei];W[gg];B[gi]
C[[lf\] this is ok for black. White is strengthening his stones at H16, but is not taking too much profit.]
;W[hl]C[[lf\] This is more annoying for black. White would have been more inspired to play at G8 though.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[fl]C[[lf\] excellent cut, makes good use of the black stones at E11.]
;W[dj];B[el];W[dm];B[gj];W[fk];B[gk];W[ek];B[ij]
(;W[im]C[[lf\] this is unnecessary];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[io]
;B[qj]C[[lf\] good move. Good timing too. Black is strong.]
;W[bp]
(;B[bq]C[[lf\] this is yose. Very little points. Black is not in danger (see var). This is much too early, and it's time for black to seize the sente.]
;W[kj];B[jh];W[jf];B[lh]
(;W[ql];B[oj]C[[lf[ I think this exchange is not good for white. White can strengthen his group at the bottom a little more, or carry on with the K14 stone to invade the upper right side.]
;W[ol];B[no];W[rn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[rq]C[[lf\] very good for black]
;W[sq]
(;B[sr]C[[lf\] again, this is yose. Black can maybe upset the situation here.]
;W[so];B[qr];W[ml]C[[lf\] this was too easy on white (see var)]
;B[le];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb]
LB[rd:A]C[i would played at 'a" but in the it N18 was looking reasonablebeacude of the J16 and K14 stones. Whats the best response

[lf\] one has to check the variations]

;W[na];B[jb];W[ja];B[ia];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[to me it looks that white has gained too much :-(


[lf\] to me too. HE has extended in both directions, and he was outnumbered.]
;W[ka]C[[lf\] this is interesting. Loss of points in gote. (for white)]
;B[kc];W[pb];B[al]C[big mistake :-( i've forgotten about C11 :( i supose this the losing move, am i right?

[lf\] maybe, maybe not. There is a big loss of points, you're right. Overlooking this happens, even though one might not want it to happen :)]
