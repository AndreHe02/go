C[Goboss [15k\]: good game

[tartuffe\] Maybe it would be better to take another corner rather than play q6 right away.  Taking a 4-4 point would really discourage w from playing r4 or r3 too early.]
;W[qd]C[DCstyle [16k?\]: yeh];B[dc];W[oc];B[jc]C[[tartuffe\] This move is low, so it doesn't work well with p4 and q6.  Also, d17 is already on the 3rd line, making the upper stones easy to flatten out.  Perhaps d15, q11, f4 would be interesting points.]
;W[pi]TR[oc][qd]C[[tartuffe\] These stones work well together]

(;B[bf];W[cf];B[cg];W[be];B[bg]TR[dg][ec][ee]C[[tartuffe\] Black can't be satisfied leaving so many cutting points around.  If white lives, let him live.  Take the opportunity to cover one of the important cutting points. B13 saves what? 5 points? Let it go! F15 would preserve the integrity of your nice upper side territory.  Give a little, save a lot.]

;W[gf]
(;B[gi]C[[tartuffe\] Defend the weaker side. G16 is screaming to be played for the following reasons:
1) G16 is the shape move
2) The upper stones are in danger of being strongly attacked
3) The upper side is weaker than the lower side.  Playing stones on the stronger side makes the white group have an easier time attacking the weak group.]

;B[ik]C[[tartuffe\] -1 point];W[tt];B[tt]C[[tartuffe\] White's prospects looked excellent in this game until the c9 stones were cut off and, of course, when the corner died.  The first error was of a strategic nature, the second was more tactical.  To fix this kind of strategic error try to think in terms of weak groups: avoid creating them and defend them (through attacking) when you do create them (as opposed to attacking enemy stones from the strong side).  Try to avoid having more than one weak group on the board at a time.  This advice sounds obvious, but it is rather difficult to execute.  Tactical errors are more a matter of reading, which you can fix on your own.

Thanks for the opportunity to review, and I apologize for the delay.  If you have any questions, find me on KGS.]
