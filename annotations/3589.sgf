C[This is Degan, reviewing.  I will preface my comments with Degan: So that you know they are not the questions that you asked.  Keep in mind that these are the comments of a 13k (on DGS, on KGS, I've been wildly variable) a higher level play would have much different suggestions.  Also, feel free to email me back with any follow-up questions]

1) White has three of four corners, are you asking if balck should give-up the forth corner.  No - cornsers are valuable.

[sb]C[played it thru over and over again that corners dead but white saw life in it and called it game its dead it has to be but how close would i be if we played it thruogh till that cluste died i lost right?can black gain any more points from here?


at A10 black can take n connect and gain 1 moku
but at f 5 he can loose 1 aswell so this it?

Degan:  upper right corner is dead.  Black probably lost a couple of points proving this.  Squares are a dead shape - bulky five.

A10 and F4 are two one-point kos.  I think playing them out is good practice.  I recently completed a game where my opponent and I played nearly fifty moves to settle a one-point ko
http://www.dragongoserver.net/game.php?gid=119475
I think I have gained some points by making threats in dame territory.

Give the huge center area white did not reduce, loosing the upper-right corner cost the game.

In general, white was strong at creating powerful, thick groups, but could easily have lost by not taking white's center more seriously and looked to reduce it with invasion.

Black did a good job of sticking with a game plan of taking the entire center, but lost on a life and death mistake in the upper right hand corner.]
