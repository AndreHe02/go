C[Tristan: Hi! This was a very enjoyable game because my opponent played in a very tight and "honest" way. I had thought I had won by komi, but it turned out that he was a little bit ahead. It seems to me that both sides played well within their limitations, and I cannot think of any obvious reason why I lost. Please help me! :-)

Hi Tristan! I added some comments; if you have any further questions, feel free
to send me an email.

C[ug: This is seen only very rarely, since W can enter at 3-3, and if B blocks at Q17,
the J17 is not in an ideal position.];W[nc]C[Tristan: I wanted something a little more complex than invading directly at 3-3.

ug: Invading at 3-3 wouldn't be bad, because W would keep sente, and would have
a nice reduction move at K16  or K15 in order to neutralize the resulting black wall.  But your move is playable too.]
;B[pf];W[pc]C[Tristan: 3-3 is possibly a little more honest, but I wanted to make shape at the top and see if I could leave some aji for R14.   I did not fancy invading at 3-3 and letting Black build a wall via Q17.

ug: 3-3 is the most common move here, but your move is ok, too]
;B[qc]C[ug: I think that R15 instead is the proper move for B.]
;W[qb]C[ug: R16 instead might also be possible, but it's hard to read out. In any case, R18 should
be fine, too.];B[qd];W[pb]C[ug: P18 is better shape and would make your group practially alive. Now you still have
to be careful, and that makes quite a difference.];B[eq];W[hq]
;B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]
(;B[jq]C[Tristan: Shouldn't Black push at D8, then after White E9 play kikashi at C6 and B5?

ug: I'm not sure B should push at D8; I would prefer to play C6 immediately (see var.)]
;W[dq]C[Tristan: I wonder if I should have played the turn at D8, but I also wanted profit.

ug: Since W ends in gote (after defending at B3), I think that this is too early.
There are more important points on the board (maybe H5 or M3). The turn at D8
doesn't look so important to me because W doesn't have good prospects
on the left side, and B probably wouldn't want to play E9 or so himself right now.]
;B[er];W[dr];B[dp];W[bq]C[ug: I think this was a bad exchange for W. B could now attack the W H3 stone
with J5 (and virtually capture it)];B[go]C[ug: Strange shape. This should enable W to do something with the H3 stone.]
;W[oq]C[TJ: Again, I really don't know whether D8 would have been better. I chose this because Black could have approached here making good use of his thickness.

ug: I like this better than D8, but since it leaves B the perfect extension to N3, I think
that there are even better moves. If you just want to take the corner, O3 looks better
because B doesn't get a nice extension then. You could also play at M3, or even pull out
your stone with H5 or J4. The latter will result in a fight, but I think that W should be  able to handle it.]
;B[mq]C[ug: Very good for B. This limits W's prospects in the corner, and makes it
much harder for W to do something with the H3 stone.]
(;W[qj]C[ug: This is big, but the upper left corner might be more important now. The reason
is that (depending on the outcome) the black J17 stone might become weak and a target
for a white attack. In other words, W could hope to play in the upper left, and
keep sente to play around R10. (see var.)];B[pi];W[nq]C[Tristan: I wanted to eliminate bad corner aji before playing Q7.

ug: But this also helps B considerably ... I still think that W should try to keep an
eye on exploiting the aji of H3, and the exchange O3-N4 works against that.
You may allow B to catch the H3 stone, but you shouldn't allow him to
catch it on such a large scale.];B[mp];W[pm]C[ug: Let's do a rough count now:

Black:
Upper right: 14 pts.
Bottom: 20 pts.
Top: 20 pts.
Total:               54 pts.

White:
Lower left: 16 pts.
Upper right: 8 pts.
Lower left: 28 pts.
Komi: 5.5 pts
Total:              57.5 pts,

This looks good enough for W, but we have to be careful. On the one hand, black will
have to spend another move at the top to secure the 20 pts we gave him (which he does).
On the other hand, B has more influence than W and has much better prospects to  expand his territory than W. The only thing W can do is to extend to L17 or M12,  but B still has the chance to make a moyo at the top, or to make his moyo at the  bottom bigger.

So I think that it is already a tough game for white.];B[fc]
;W[dl]C[ug: This is not so important here, I think; an extension to C11 or C12 might be better.
(Maybe even to C14 , to make C12 and starting some action in the corner miai).]
;B[ch]C[ug: This neutralises the influence that W got from D8, and is also territorially big. This
is a very nice double-purpose move for B, and that means that the previous W move
probably wasn't ideal.];W[cc]C[Tristan: This is White's last chance to invade. If Black gets the time to make sure with D16 then I can give up :-)

ug: I'm not sure if this is a good idea. A reduction might be a better option. Since B is very strong here, W cannot hope to get many points in the corner, and outside
thickness will certainly be useful for B.];B[dc];W[bd]C[ug: Maybe D16 is better, instead.]
;B[cb];W[bc];B[ce];W[bb];B[db];W[be]
(;B[cf]C[ug: Why can't B play B14 (and kill W) instead? (see var.)]
;W[ba]C[ug: Even now that W lives, he has not gained much, I think. He has got 4 points
in the corner, but B should be able to make 25+ points at the top (thus our count
in a sense remains valid, or improves a bit for B).];B[lc];W[od]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[ke];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[mf]C[ug: There are more interesting points for B, I think, e.g. L13, or around K5.]
;W[gh]C[ug: Good. A light reduction is the right thing to do.]

(;W[gi]C[ug: J10 might be better shape.];B[ek];W[ji];B[pj];W[qk]
;B[pk];W[ql]C[Tristan: Painful to have to defend like this, because Black builds thickness and White is still vulnerable in the centre, but what choice is there?

ug: In any case, Q8 is a little bit better. Furthermore, although it is big, it is an option
to ignore B Q10.];B[gf];W[ig];B[li];W[ik];B[im];W[hm];B[in]
;W[il];B[ln]C[ug: B should continue the attack of the W center group.]
;W[es];B[fr];W[fs];B[gs];W[ds];B[gr];W[lj]C[Tristan: I very much wanted to play N2, but Black also had territorial prospects in the right-hand centre, and I still need to settle things in the centre.]
;B[mr];W[rb]C[Tristan: I don't want to be submissive.];B[ri]
C[Tristan: This move hurt me.];W[rj];B[ps];W[se]C[Tristan: "An eye for an eye".]
;B[rr]C[Tristan: This is about the only time Black slips up in this game, since it extends a little too far, and allows me to snip away S2.]

;B[em];W[je];B[le];W[nd];B[ms];W[bl];C[Tristan: B+4.5

ug: This was a good game. The main mistakes W made were (I think) to let B capture
the H3 stone on a very large scale, and the invasion at C17 (which should have died,
and didn't help W very much anyway). Furthermore I think that you overestimated
the value of the turn at D8 which is indeed a very thick move, but not so important
in this position.

In the end, W got surprisingly many points in the center (B shouldn't have allowed that),
but even so, it was not enough.])

mind that the stones around F17 are light, and can be sacrificed if needed. Since
the black group at M17 is not very strong, the W group in the upper right corner
should not get into trouble, either. (maye it would be good to make sure that the
O17 group gets out into the center before playing R9).

(If B cuts at F16, W responds as in the continuation and gets very strong, so B shouldn't
do that.)];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[hd];B[gc];W[hc];B[fb];W[hb]))
