C[Dear reviewer;  Thanks for taking time to review this game.  I am white, as usual.  This was a calm game - no "oops" or big dead groups.  I didn't feel outplayed, yet it was unusual in that I seemed behind for most of the game.  Pick any aspect you want to comment, as it all needs work.]

I prefer G4, see variations.
In the game black settles big territories too easily];B[ep]

;W[ch];B[di]LB[dh:A]C[A seems better for black, now white can escape too easily, breaking black territory.]
;W[df]LB[dh:A]C[W36:  or C15 or D12?

D12 looks like the only move to me.];B[cg];W[dg]C[D12 still.]
;B[dh]C[Letting C12 stone die like this can't be good.];W[ce]
;B[bh];W[be];B[kp]C[Maybe upper side more important now.];W[nc]
;B[pc];W[kd];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[ic]C[My opening used to be the best part of my game, but lately I seem to give too much solid territory to my opponents.  Is that an accurate assessment here?

Yes, it's what happened in lower and left sides.
The main problem in this game is that you have small, unrelated groups. Even if black failed later to play the more severe moves, the game was better for black or close all the time.]
;B[ee];W[bg]C[Good !];B[fg];W[bf]C[Too early, should not be sente now.]

(;B[ci]C[It's big, but there are more interesting things to do.

See variations.];B[kq];W[mo];B[oo];W[lr];B[kr];W[rh]LB[mm:A]

Are A or B possible ?];B[ii]
(;W[im]LB[kl:A][jk:B]C[This is begging to be surrounded, I would play A or B]

(;B[kl]LB[jk:A]C[Maybe not severe enough, I prefer A.];W[io]
LB[lc:A][mc:B][oj:C]C[I count that I have caught up some since move 50 and that I am only a few points behind - no komi.  Your assessment?

It's difficult to correctly assess this position: you still have 3 unsettled groups: the center upper one has weak points at A and B, the lower dragon can be cut from the rigth with C and lacks eyes, an the center group still will provide black with sente moves in the center to reinforce the position before deciding to play C, or after looking for a miai move that can threaten both groups.

So much depends on what can black really do in those complicate fights.
If all white groups settle without problems, you seem right.]

;B[dj];W[kk];B[kj];W[je];B[jf];W[kf]C[At this point I thought I had done well and it was now a close game.  Your thoughts?

Right. Black failed to find the most severe moves in the lower fights and you settled your stones easily playing in the key points.]

Seems a natural move, I think the mistake comes later.];B[le]

see variation.]
(;W[ke]C[I white can capture, then this is game losing, or at least gives black a good chance.]
;B[mc]
(;W[nd]LB[lc:A]C[Again, W170 a little risky?

Yes,  A is the move to play, then the game is close.

Seems W170 can be labeled the losing move, or at least is the end of all hope.]

Right, Q8 is not possible.
But maybe A is better, next black move is good.];B[og]C[Good, very annoying move.]

With this and komi it would still be a close game.];B[sg];W[ri]

Again, rescuing at A is still possible, same variations aply.]
