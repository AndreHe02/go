(;W[jp]C[This move feels slack. W should approach one of the corners.]
;B[lq];W[do]
(;B[dp]C[>what about this move?

I  don't think it is appropriate. It's a move used to settle the corner quickly with secure profit. In this position, B has no reason to settle the corner quickly, but should aim to make it difficult for W to settle his stones by initiating a splitting attack. The first rule of attacking is to avoid contact plays, so I think this move is unsound.]
;W[eo];B[co];W[cn];B[bo]
(;W[dm]C[This move is heavy. I think it is preferable to quickly link up with the weak W side stone]
;B[fp]
(;W[gq]TR[eo][gq]SQ[fp]C[>bad?

Yes. You're helping B to split your stones. If you cannot connect your stones, you should play in the other direction.

From a shape point of view, you're making a shape where B is already occupying the vital spot.]

(;B[bd]C[Tenuki cannot possibly be good in this position.. Especially to play such a low move.]

(;W[ch]C[W cannot afford an attack considering his extremely weak position at the bottom.]
;B[cc];W[ce];B[be];W[df];B[dg];W[cg]C[>what value compare to  joseki b14 ?

Your position at the bottom is not strong enough to support playing strongly.]
;B[bf]
(;W[di]C[W is making yet another weak group...];B[ef];W[de]
;B[bn]C[This move is rather pointless.. W could ignore it and patch up his weaknesses.]

(;W[bm]C[This is also possible (to keep the B side stone weak).]
;B[cl];W[cm]C[>E13 bigger?

If you want to ignore B, you should do it when he plays B6, as the loss is smaller]

(;B[eg]C[This is too soon. It is a heavy way of playing -- just attack for no profit.]
;W[ek]C[excellent point.];B[gd]
(;W[dc]C[This move doesn't threaten to kill the corner, so it is very heavy.]

(;W[oo]C[Very heavy play. You're defending a stone that B has already answered _twice_. That makes the stone very light (kikashi stones are light). It also gives B a chance to fix the remaining aji (see variation).]
;B[nq];W[ep]
(;B[eq];W[fq];B[go]C[Again a very heavy move. B should think of how to profit from the aji in this stone. Pulling it out immediatly does not make any profit.]

This lack of understanding lead both players to make several heavy moves. Defending these heavy moves was what caused the all-or-nothing fights to happen. I think you need to learn to appreciate the subtle pleasure of taking profit while forcing the opponent to defend. (In many cases, he won't defend, and then you've strengthened yourself and you can attack even more strongly)]
