C[Dear reviewer,

this game is typical for my style allthough the positions are unusual.
I played White on KGS and lost by 2.5 points. At move 176 there is an obvious
reading error (O6) and at move 202 I should have cut where my opponent was
blundering. Apart from this, I see little room for improvement. So I'm leaving this
pretty much uncommented, see what you have to say. I speak German, too.

Many thanks
Christoph];B[pd]C[Basti: Hi nice you have improved by a stone! You lost this game because you failed to punish your opponents greadiness. Early in the game he build a weak group and while he should defend it, he reinforced his bottom, invaded your left side and your upper left corner. Such behavior should be punished. However he got away with it and around move 60 the game was already decided.

;W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[kq];W[ho];B[ko]C[Basti: Greedy move #1. The game could very well be ended by white's next move.]

(;W[hm]C[Basti: I have looked at variations for F6 and G6 and they seem to be good for white. G7 should be possible too.

If you can't kill a group shutting it in is good, too. The black stones on the inside won't play much of a role in the future of the game while all your stones on the outside have influence. So at the same time preventing to be shut in is big. Furthermore if he get's killed he can resign but if he survives he still hasn't won! So don't make such a mistake yourself!

You tried to attack with H7 but you could be a little more aggressive like in the variations. This way you only drove him out.
But don't get me wrong. Hunting your opponent to make territory or strengthen your own groups is great but he has already ignored your move when you attempted to do so with H5 so you can aim at more now!]

;W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[cb]
(;W[ff]C[Basti: This seems too submissive. Now black has invaded twice and still has the time to defend his group.
The C16 group should be ok as long as it has forcing moves at E17 etc.]
;B[hi]
(;W[nc]C[Basti: Not much room for your stones. I'd rather try Q17 or R17.]
;B[pc];W[kc];B[og]C[Basti: This is my final comment. I won't comment on the endgame because you played it much better. See the variation for my endgame. Black should have won by 15 points.

The biggest mistakes where the soft moves 20 and 22. Later you let him get away with his invasions and defended submissivly. When you attacked in the end it was already too late. You could have also played better in the upper right corner but I think the game was already lost then.

My advice to you for this game is to play a little more aggressive.]
