Dear Reviewee,

It is my pleasure to research this go game with you, for it enkindles my nostalgia of go, which unfortunately left me months ago. I love it deeply, but have no time. You know, life is quite a burden.

Your friend with go,
Yao Kai

P.R.China];B[pd]C[Black always plays the 1st stone at the right-upper corner to show respect to the opponent.]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[dn]LB[kp:a][jp:b][jq:c][fp:d]C[It seems white's 6 is not necessarily here at D6, because we always play this formula when there are stones around a(L4), which can be said as the precondition.   But if white does have stone at a now, simple reply with d(F4) is natural and good enough, which can get sente and reserve corner variations for further decision.

(You know, we should play go naturally as possible, for nature is the essence of go and life.)

Note: in this case, white's 2,4 and a form the "high Chinese opening", which has been proved highly efficient, while normally white's 2 always extends itself at b(K4) or c(K3).]
;B[dm];W[en]LB[co:a][kp:b]C[White's 8th stone has another choice at a(C5) to ensure more territory, but it is not good enough yet for no extension at b(L4).]
;B[co];W[cp];B[cj]
(;W[gp]LB[kq:a][fp:b][do:c]C[White's 12 looks not good shape, I prefer a(L3) instead. b(F4) is also good shape, but too solid and less efficient than a I think.

Note: white's 2, 4 and a form the "Chinese opening", which emphasize on territory rather than influence comparing with "high Chinese opening".

If black plays c(D5) in response to white's a ... (see variation please).]
;B[qj]LB[jd:a]C[It seems now black has opportunity to extend its left-upper in both sides of upper and left with a(K16); this kind of shape is always admired.

See variation please.]
(;W[qm]LB[jc:a][jd:b]C[It is good for white to play a(K17) to decrease black's influence.

a for white and b(K16) for black are essential points for both! (not mentioned thereafter)]
;B[qg];W[jc];B[hc]LB[lc:a]C[Black could approach white's right-lower corner first and reserve the choice of 17 or a(M17) for further decision.]
;W[nc]LB[mc:a][lc:b]C[White should play a little solid with a(N17) to avoid black's immediate invasion at b(M17). There are more black stones in the upper side, so white has good reason to show conservation.]
;B[pc]LB[lc:a]C[It is more positive of black to invasion at a(M17) to make white not settled easily, because black is much stronger here.]
;W[je]C[Good! White strengthens itself and decreases black's influence in the center.]
;B[lp]LB[oq:a]C[Not good point for invasion, approach at a (P3) instead is better.]
;W[jq]LB[oq:a]C[White should protect its corner and attack black with a(P3) instead. a is better than 22 because it gains more territory and better shape with 4 and 14.]
;B[op];W[pq];B[oq]LB[qn:a]C[Now black splits white's lower side and makes a relatively better shape comparing with white's 24, 4 and 14, with 14 at a(R6) being normal.]
;W[ko]LB[qo:a][po:b]C[I am afraid white should protect its weakness around a(R5) with b(Q5) now, because black can do something harmful to white there.

See variations please.]
(;B[kr]C[Black may refer to the many variations with the last move.]
;W[mr]LB[mn:a]C[Perhaps it is good enough for white to play at a(N6) instead to force black to survive inside.

Remember that it is usually bad to be enclosed, even if already alive.]
;B[kq];W[or];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[pl];B[nm];W[qk];B[ol];W[ok]
;B[kp];W[jp]C[They are all vulgar moves from 31 to 39 for both.]
;B[ir]C[Black's 41 is not necessary at this time, for it is only yose move, while there are many bigger moves on board.]
;W[hq];B[gr];W[jr];B[js];W[hr];B[is];W[hs];B[pp];W[qq];B[pj]
;W[pk];B[lo];W[kn]C[They are all not necessary to play here from 42 to 53 for both, because  there are many bigger moves elsewhere.]
;B[he]LB[ml:a][cc:b][dc:c]C[No, Black can not leave the right-lower now! Because if white attacks at a(N8) or some places around, black will definitely suffer. I recommend a to survive out.

(The above will not have been mentioned thereafter.)

Even if black does want to play at the upper side, 55 will not be the proper point now, which leaves excellent invasion of b(C17) for white, so c(D17)  to secure the corner is preferred, which brings quite a lot of territory.

By the way, when one side declares the right to start at a new field, it should judge the current situation first and then see what it should do.

For now, see variation please.]
(;W[me]C[Now the left-upper corner is valuable for both.

C[Both white's 56 and black's 57 are good-shaped locally.];W[em]

white a(D8), black b(C8), white 58, black c(C7).];B[dl];W[fk]
C[White's 60 is good-shaped locally.];B[dg]LB[cc:a][ce:b]C[Black's 61 makes white's current invasion at a(C17) more excellent than the time of 55, so I still prefer to protect the corner by b(C15) now.]
;W[ch]C[The value of black's left side territory is much less than that of the corner.]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[bj];B[ck];W[bk];B[bl];W[bf];B[ce];W[be]
;B[bd];W[cf];B[df];W[bh];B[fi]C[77 is small.];W[hj]C[78 is bigger than 77, but not urgent.   Do both of the players believe that the right-lower black group could make alive without any payment?

There is a go saying which is of great value: " the critical point is more important than the big one".   If one can apperceive it, he will make notable progress.]
;B[kl]LB[ml:a]C[79 is to decrease white's center points, but a little aggressive. Please note: black's right-lower group is not alive yet! I still prefer a(N8).]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[nq]LB[ml:a]C[Why? Black could probably ignore this to obtain the critical point of a(N8).

We can compare black's a with white's a: the latter move encloses the black group, which force black to live inside(if it could make it) and black's 79 stone dies.]

[ci][bj]C[Now it is white's turn to begin the yose moves. It should judge the current situation and then decide what it should do.

Black's territory(marked by "X"):
left-upper: 37 points,
left-lower: 6 points,
right-upper: 27 points,
right-lower: 6 points.
Black has 76 points totally.

White's territory(marked by triangle):
left: 4 points(black starts here in sente and white can not make 6 points),
left-lower and center: 53 points,
right-lower: 23 points,
upper: 11 points,
komi: 5.5 points.
White has 96.5 points totally and ahead by about 20.

From above we can conclude that if white make the yose moves as usual, it will surely win.

For me, black could probably resign here, because only yose moves left and black is behind too much.

The following moves have not done much to the result of the game, in fact which has already come out, so there is no further comment.]

White has about 60 points totally, and ahead by 30 or so.

From above we can see that black is eager for over 30 points to win, so what it should do is to gain territory.

But unfortunately black has a weak group(right-lower). To my knowledge, the best step for it is a(N8) to strengthen the weak and then b(D17) to make territory, if it is lucky enough to get the latter.]
