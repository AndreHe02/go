charleslee:  Hi reviewer.
  I am black and set my rank 13k.
I think I was leading the whole game, but I was lost at the end.


Joerg:
I don't think so (see move 110). Look at the score: you lost by 20 points and that's big. You can't say that the few endgame points you lost made you loose that high. My opinion is, that White had a good lead most of the game. The upper side was big all the time and so was the bottom left corner. Maybe you misjudged the situation because you thought your center moyo would bring a lot of points? Always keep in mind that a moyo (and also territory in the center) looks bigger than it is. The key of this game was the lower right corner. You should have defended there earlier and take a good lead. Instead you ended with a weak group. But it was not a bad game, you surely  improve if you make your weak groups safe at the right time. And remember that territories easiest are made in the corners, then at the sides and only after that a territory-oriented play in the center would be ok. Keep also in mind, that a play where both players could expand their territory is more urgent than!
 s!
imply making some points elsewhere. In the endgame try to play the bigger moves first.  ( :-) Sounds easy. ) I notice that you defend a single stone in gote instead of taking bigger points. (For example 191) Don't be too concerned about single stones. Offer them as a sacrifice. Your opponent will have to play another move to catch it, so you could play another move elsewhere. Another good way of improving is trying to count territory during the game.

questions and comments in the game

Bye, Joerg.

[gromit\] well... I agree with some of these comments but not all:
thrue, the lower right corner should have been an attack of black on white and not the reverse, however black could have gained a compensation on the upper right if he played for a big attack/big moyo around moves 61 and 65.
The upper side was not small, but it is quite low and not so much of a concern if black has thickness in exchange... and uses it! Same for the lower left.
So to conclude I would say that you give Black good advice on how to have more territory, but even if he didn't manage to get some, early in the game, he played for influence, which seems also reasonable to me, provided he uses it to attack.]

Make White overconcentrated.

[gromit\] Of course the sequence you propose in the variation is possible, but I do think that what Black played is actually not so bad:
Black has no weakness whatsoever in the corner, White still has to run towards the center, and what you said from your variation is still true, "If [white\] tries to make room, he helps solidifying your upper territory."]

(;B[hq]C[I think you should sacrifice this lone stone and take the bottom right corner or attack the white group to the right instead.

[gromit\] I agree but I think that attacking is more urgent as it will help Black going towards the center and thus he may not need to reinforce the corner.]
;W[nr]C[you loose a lot of points here, because you defended a single stone which served no purpose... :-(

in additon the three black stones here are totally outnumbered and in danger, so that attacking the two white stones severely will be nearly impossible without making the group safe first.

[gromit\] the second point of your comment seems much more important than the first: it's about fighting now, not about a few points...]
;B[mn];W[ol];B[oj];W[oh];B[mk]LB[ml:A][nk:B]C[[gromit\] This is a comment about the game and not the comments, however I think it's important to remember to "push towards your strength". Here Black is strong in the upper right and weak in the lower right, so playing aroud A is probably safer and will induce a White move around B which will help Black build his moyo.]

(;B[qh]C[2. at the 61th move, do I need to defend at r12 or attack p12(the white stone)? If defendence is better, how can I attack this white stone?

I think this move is ok. (VAR is maybe slightly better).  It gives you territory and connects the three black stones around P10 to the upper black group. Moreover white has to bring out his P12 stone now, before you cap it.

[gromit\] Here is my biggest disagreement: I think this move (and the one proposed in the var) is very slow. Of course it's solid, but Black has already given up a lot of territory and his sole compensation is his hope to build a big moyo, see variation for a way to try and save his game.]
;W[mh];B[pm];W[qm]
(;B[mi]C[I don't like this move. It makes White strong.

[gromit\] yes, and it doesn't help black 3 stones which are already connected by R12
now the center looks smaller and the upper right too :(];W[mf]
;B[fe]LB[ge:A]C[In relation to the moyos this move is good. It expands your moyo while flatting out White's.

[gromit\] I would go as far as A: bigger moyo and more threats on the border (around H17)]
;W[hd];B[hf];W[jl];B[hk]C[Not good.   At this point you have to seek live in the corner with the bottom right group.

There was a miai in the corner. Life or move out. With the white move 70 your movement into the center is no longer easy. So you should have played in the corner.

miai: "Two  points  which  accomplish  the  same  result; if        deprived of one, the other must be played." In this case the result should be a living group.

[gromit\] Yes. Moreover, White's group is not completely alive yet and if Black lives in the corner White might have to live too thus letting Black close his moyo...]

;W[id];B[ne];W[me];B[jj]MA[me][mf][mh][oh]LB[jh:A][lg:B]C[3.at the 97th move, it seems that I should put in Q17 instead of K10 ?? I am not sure because K10 maybe can get more points?

That's right. Play in the corners first. To make center territory you need much more stones. The play in the corner is much bigger than K10.

First, White still can reduce by a play around K12.  Second, by playing in the corner you make sure that White is not possible to make territory there himself. It is important that you are the first to play where both players could make points. Therefore a play in the lower left is big, too.

[gromit\] I still think that the lower left reduction is sente
in the upper right your comments are true but O17 instead of Q17 seems more severe (see var).

about a K12 reducing move (A), it may be a little dangerous as long as the marked stones are not connected: imagine a peep at B after A. However it's very true that K10 is small.]
