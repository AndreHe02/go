C[Dear Reviewer,

We are Sylvain (White, KGS 7k) and Stephane (Black, KGS 6k) from Tahiti, President and Secretary of the famous Fenua.Go club (around 2 or 3 members in this club) :-)

We learned together since around 2 years and play frenquently together.

This is a real board game, we would like your review to show our mistakes or misjudgments, for both black or white.

Hope you will enjoy this review, and thanks for it.

crux: Hi, my name is Bernd Schmidt, and I'm around 2dan at the local club.  I hope this review proves useful.  To make sure it is displayed as intended, please use an SGF viewer that properly displays variations and annotations; I recommend qGo, gGo, cgoban1 or Jago.  There are some problems with cgoban2, the KGS client.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[qn];W[nq]C[is pincer better here ?

crux: I don't see anything wrong with this move.];B[pj];W[od]
LB[nc:A]C[crux: A move at A seems to be by far the most common in this kind of position, to make a pincer less likely and less severe.]
;B[lc]TR[ld][mc][md]C[what about this pincer ? is it the right place or better triangle places ?

crux: This pincer is rare - you could say it "doesn't exist".  One space higher is more common.]
;W[qc]C[What about this hole 'non-joseki' secquence ?];B[pd]
C[crux: Bumping into a stone like this is generally bad style, because in the next move it becomes a hane at the head of two stones.]
;W[pc];B[oe];W[ne];B[nd];W[oc];B[pf]LB[of:A]C[crux: Better at A, I think.]
;W[md]
(;B[nc]LB[nf:A]C[crux: If Black is going to sacrifice three or four stones here, he must get some compensation out of it.  If he doesn't manage to seal White in, the whole maneuver is pointless aji-keshi.  Probably Black should play at A to help fix up his shape on the right side.  See the variation.]
;W[mc]LB[lc:A]C[crux: The marked stone is becoming spoiled...]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[me];W[nf];B[ld];W[lb];B[mf];W[ng];B[kb];W[na]
;B[ic]LB[jc:A]C[is the result better for White or Black ? I find equal, white gets black's initial corner, and an alive group going around with menaces on right border, and black get thick ness on left side.

crux: To me this seems clearly better for White.  White has corner territory and access to the center.  Black's four stones in the top right have bad shape and can come under attack; Black's last move seems to be in the wrong spot (locally, A is much better, but even then I wouldn't want to play Black).]

(;W[df]TR[cf]C[I found C14 too easy for black to make closer on left side with big thik moyo on top (variation below)

Is it right choice ?

crux: Even if Black gets a moyo on the top, it's a bit narrow and there seem to be defects around K18.  I don't think it would be too troublesome for White.  I've added a few more variations.]
;B[ef]C[This is another non-joseki sequence. Picer would be better ? no ?
What about the following moves, answering to B E14 ?

crux: There are hardly any joseki for the high approach move.]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[de];B[fd];W[dj]LB[cd:A]C[crux: Here I'd play hane at A as White, to bite off more of the corner, and give the group stability.]
;B[ph]C[is it right move to get thick for black's right side. I find black very concentrated, but White Q12 would be great menace.

crux: Well, it helps patch up a few holes here - the problem lies with earlier moves that allowed Black to get into this position.  However, Black might just want to treat the wreckage lightly and play another big move, such as a corner approach in the lower left.]
;W[fq]TR[dj][nq]LB[cd:B][ep:A]C[This I liked. Is it right ?

crux: It certainly looks like a commonsense move, although locally I would have played at A (it feels like it would make a better balance with the two marked stones).  Absolute judgements of right and wrong are impossible, at least for someone of my strength.  B is still very big.]
;B[bp]LB[cq:A]C[What is better way for Black to invade here ?

crux: A seems to be the most common spot for an invasion inside the shimari.  It may be slightly too early for this.]
;W[bo]TR[bq]C[I prefered B5 (border) to B3 (corner) is ti right ?

crux: The general idea seems to be sensible.  Black should probably try to crosscut and develop a light shape.]

(;B[cq];W[dp];B[br];W[cn]LB[ap:A]C[crux: This seems a bit feeble.  A normal approach would be to play at A to get a ko (check the balance of ko threats first, though).]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[ep]C[crux: Pointless.  White can capture in one move without a ladder - see variation.]

(;W[eo];B[lh];W[gq]C[crux: If you want to make sure Black doesn't pull the stone, simply capturing it is best.]
;B[cd]C[Who is ahead now ?

crux: Again, impossible to tell for certain for someone of my strength.  Somehow, White has manged to end in gote in the lower left, but there seems to be a ko left, which is a big uncertainty.  Black's last move is *very* big, taking the corner and undermining White on the left.]
;W[fg]LB[dg:A][eh:B][rp:C]C[I disliked this move, because Black G13 is hane on two stones, and invasion from C16 is not protected. But I wanted to extend influence in center. What do u think about that

crux: The cutting point at A looks vaguely annoying, especially if Black does play the hane on top.  If White is going to play in this area, I think I might prefer B to eliminate some aji, but I'm not sure I like this direction at all.
White could think about playing C to take solid territory and threaten an invasion on the right.  White could also make plans for a moyo at the bottom, or start the ko in the lower left if he feels he'll get a good result.]
;B[bf]C[crux: What follows in the next couple of moves is purely an endgame sequence.  White should probably just forget about trying to make territory on the left.]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[dg];B[bh];W[ci];B[qq]C[crux: Black took more territory but helped White to patch up some holes in his position.  Black gets sente, so I'd say this isn't too bad for him on the whole.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[pr]C[here I wanted to end sente thinking of variation below. But it was not so good.]
;B[pq];W[oq]
(;B[nr];W[mr];B[qr];W[mp];B[ql]C[crux: This one seems a bit slow.]
;W[gf]TR[pn]C[I think now I choose wrong side. no ?

crux: This seems to be big - both sides are trying to build a moyo around here.  Maybe White should try to develop on the bottom - it seems wider.]

(;B[ed];W[if]LB[hg:A]C[crux: I'd prefer to play a solid move like the hanging connection at A.  The game move leaves too much aji for my taste.]
;B[oo];W[on]C[crux: Don't resist unless it gives you a better result.  Just connecting here would have been OK.]
;B[nn];W[no];B[pn];W[mn];B[nm];W[op];B[mm];W[ln];B[kl];W[hd]
C[is it so good (or so bad ?)

crux: Seems like a smallish endgame move to me.  Too early for this; it'll remain sente for a long time.]
;B[ge]LB[gg:A]C[crux: Seems aji-keshi as it more or less eliminate the cut at A.]
;W[hf];B[he];W[ie];B[gd];W[ij];B[jm]C[This seems very strong

crux: Agreed, a nice calm move.];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[jo];W[lm]
C[now I misread the following cut-secquence leading me to close black's side, with my stones inside. Could I do best with N8 following-cut-secquence ?

crux: I don't think you can realistically hope to achieve much by cutting.  The cutting stone will be in Black's area of influence and is likely to be captured.]
;B[ll];W[ml]
(;B[nl]LB[lj:A]C[crux: This is bad.  Do not give atari needlessly - an atari from this side doesn't seem to help you.  It is probably better to just play at A, and I think the cleanest capture can be had with the atari on the other side - see variation.]
;W[mk];B[lj];W[mh];B[mj];W[nk]C[well, here I should stop deasaster....]
;B[nj];W[ol];B[om];W[pm];B[on];W[pk];B[qk];W[qj];B[oj];W[qg]
;B[pg];W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[pe];W[rf];B[qf];W[se];B[rc]C[ok, all thoses lost to get one ko.]
;W[qe];B[la];W[ob];B[re];W[qm];B[rm];W[qe];B[lq];W[ns];B[ps]
;W[mq];B[re];W[rn];B[pl];W[qe];B[rg];W[qh];B[re];W[jn];B[kn]
C[crux: Better to atari on the other side.];W[qe];B[rh];W[qi]
;B[re]
(;W[os]LB[ms:A]C[probably wrong menace because weaken my N3 group after Black N1

crux: This is a points-losing ko threat, which is usually the wrong thing to play.  I think a move a A would have threatened to kill the whole corner.]
;B[ms];W[qe];B[sc];W[rb];B[re];W[lp]C[My N3 group is too weak now, I must save it  :-(]
;B[sf]LB[sb:A]C[crux: Better to capture on the other side, to avoid giving White a forcing move at A.]
;W[in];B[kp];W[lo]TR[km][ko]C[Black has 2 cuts now, so L4 was probably mistake]
;B[hl]TR[io][ks]C[is it right way ? what about Black J5, or Black L1

crux: This move seems to move neatly into White's central area.  L1 is the other obvious choice.  J5 seems to create unnecessary complications.]
;W[lr];B[km];W[ko];B[hn]C[crux: Nice :)];W[im]C[Playing this I get afraid of Black J5, but (see variation), Black J8 was better]

(;B[il];W[io];B[ih]TR[hm]LB[gk:A]C[crux: This one is not so good.  It's reducing only a small area.  A move at A seems like a better move to continue reduction, it also helps guard against White pushing through the gap.]
;W[hm];B[hi];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl];B[fk];W[ek]C[Here black helped White to close his side, wide enough.What do u think ?

crux: Black didn't choose optimal moves here, but White's territory isn't very big, especially if Black ever decides it's time to add another move to the lower left corner.]
;B[kf]C[crux: Not really big enough at this stage.  It's only four stones or so.]
;W[gh];B[hj];W[mg]
(;B[dr]LB[aq:B][er:A]C[crux: Better to play either A or B, I think.]
;W[er]C[crux: Now, Black seems to need another move to live.]
;B[sb]C[crux: Black can still reduce the left side; I think he should be doing that.]
;W[kg];B[jd];W[id];B[hc];W[kh];B[li]C[crux: Much too small.]
;W[ji];B[lg];W[jg];B[bj];W[bi];B[ai];W[bk];B[ak];W[al];B[aj]
C[crux: Black is running out of liberties... he must make sure that White can't play at B15 during this sequence.]
;W[cj];B[ah];W[bl];B[be];W[ap];B[aq];W[bq];B[ls];W[ks];B[bp]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[bq];B[kr]LB[ns:A]C[crux: Bad,  should connect at A to threaten this cut.  This is another points-losing ko threat.]
;W[ns];B[bp];W[kk];B[lk];W[bq];B[ig];W[jf]TR[ke][kf]C[This exchange also loses points for Black, because he ends up giving up these stones, and because White can now capture the marked two stones.]
;B[bp];W[pi];B[oi];W[bq];B[hg];W[gg];B[bp];W[ik]C[crux: If Black connects, he gets another ko threat or two around here.  This is quite a big ko threat to ignore.]
;B[ao];W[hk];B[bn]
(;W[dn]TR[rs]C[Which is bigger ?

crux: Just connect, I'd think.];B[co];W[do];B[rs]C[crux: -1 point gote.]

(;W[cf];B[bg];W[qa]LB[ra:A]C[crux: Should be at A, although there's not much in it.]
