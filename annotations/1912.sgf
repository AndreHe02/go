Hi reviewer!  I am playing black.  I put a big emphasis on trying to keep my stones connected to each other in this game.  I think it paid off.  I won by resignation.  I still feel like if it weren't for some obvious mistakes my opponent made, i wouldn't have fared so well.

Thanks for the review!

Hi Matthew, My name is Emiliano Bacci, 3k.
Pleased to review your game!];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[de];B[pk]
C[High Chinese fuseki.];W[pf]C[i think this was a pretty bad move...i'm going to exploit it for thickness and territory on the sides]
;B[nd];W[nf];B[jd];W[ld];B[ph]C[should i have put more emphasis on my upper right stones?  I feel perhaps they could be attacked now?

N15 is a must, in my opinion.];W[oh];B[pi]C[i'm happy with this]
;W[fp]C[i think this move was too conservative on my opponent's part

Yes, it is completeley gote. Moreover, it secures no territory.
Black can still aim at the corner. Anyway, White has a nice framework on the left. But Fuseki theory says: play urgent points before big points. N15 URGENT!]
;B[jp]C[this move feels strong

It is big. But the point is the same as ever: play urgent points first!]
;W[dj]
(;B[qe]C[i wanted to enclose the corner...but i did it at the expense of connectedness.  perhaps R14 would have been better, as in the variation?]
;W[pg];B[kf]C[i'm going to create some thickness by attacking the right white group so i can then invade upper left

This is a strange decision to me. I would have applied the "divide" & conquer strategy with N15. Your attack is softer,
but on a global perspective it annihilates the White mojo.
Perhaps your strategy is much better than mine...];W[lf];B[kg]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[me];B[dc]C[this is what i was setting up for.

Black is clearly ahead. White has few points at the top right and his framework on the left is of little value, thanks to your L14 group and  K4 stone. Black has the upper right corner plus something yet undefined on the lower right corner.]
;W[cd]C[White's move is really bad.
If White wants to go for territory, C17 is the key move.
The usual answer at F16 is of little value thanks to L14.
From a global perspective, the only hope to win for White is to separate D17 from L14 and attack. So, I would have played E17.]
;B[fd]C[Great! I think this is game over!];W[ed]
(;B[fc]C[i debated over this move...maybe f15 would be better, as in variation?  i was willing to sacrifice the d17 stone in order to gain thickness.

IThe corner is really huge! You are already thick.
Even if White builds a wall around line 15, your L!4 wall will erase its power, while you get big bucks at the top!
I think Black should be happe to be forced to play E17. See variation]
;W[fe];B[eg]C[i wanted to try and separate the top left 4 white stones from the bottom left white stones, and drive the top 4 stones towards my thickness in the center

Good intention, but I think your plan is unfeasible. 
White's upper group is strong. So your stones seems more like a prey than a burden... If you want to invade, try C12, threatening C10 or E12. But reducing as I suggested before is a calm way to win. The more you fight, the more you give your opponent opportunities to come back.]
;W[fg];B[ei];W[ef];B[fh];W[dg]C[If White wants to connect, C12 is the move.]
;B[di]C[Great!];W[dh];B[ci];W[cj];B[fk];W[ek];B[fl];W[el];B[fn]
C[i am happy with this result...white's 2 groups on the left are separated, and i've gained more thickness towards the center]
;W[en]C[Black's mojo in the center is impressive, while White has gained very little in the left. White should surrender and not waste any further time...]
;B[gg];W[eh];B[gi];W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[hm]C[perhaps this move was a mistake?  i wanted to ensure i had the ladder if white g8]
;W[fo];B[gq];W[ho];B[jn];W[od];B[oc];W[oe];B[qc];W[nc];B[nb]
;W[mc];B[po]C[about time i did that

I think move 55 is best for that move.
I would have played R4 to prevent any invasion, but your 
move is ok.
GAME OVER, Mr White!];W[nj]C[i'm not going to try and kill the white group on the right, only drive it down to gain territory in the center

You cannot kill it, it is already alive. So, it is not a choice of you.]

;W[on];B[ok]
(;W[nl];B[pp];W[ob]C[i'm a little worried about life, now, but i think i have enough room]

(;B[qg]C[see variation];W[qf];B[rg];W[rf];B[re];W[sg]
(;B[rh]C[was this the right move, or would the T12 variation have been better?

The answer is: NOOOO! Look at my continuation on your proposed variation.]
;W[sh];B[si];W[sf];B[rj];W[gf]C[Black is live with a ko in the upper right corner!!!!]
;B[pa];W[na];B[hd]C[H13 better than H16.
White can still play above H16 not to let black have the top.
K18, for example.
White C18/Black B18 huge!];W[hg];B[ii];W[gh];B[fi];W[sd]C[a mistake. 

Yes. This mistake is worthy about 45 points!];B[se];W[jc];B[ic]
;W[jb];B[mh];W[nh];B[np];W[op];B[nq];W[hq]C[i think i should have preempted this move earlier on...this stone was too far away]

;W[nm];B[er];W[cq]C[white resigns
Resignation comes very late indeed...

You played very well, with very few tactical mistakes.
In my opinion the fastest way for you to improve is to 
count your territories from the middle game and make your strategical decisions based on whole board considerations. You made a lot of risky fights on the left. 
Since you are much stronger than your opponent, 
those fights brought you a gain. But with a tougher opponent, those fights are just a chance of loosing a won game.

The biggest error stands on the upper right corner. It is worth 45 points!]
