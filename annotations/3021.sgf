C[Hi! I'm wjzz and i played black in this game. I resigned at the 167 move, because it was looking terribly. I lost two big groups and didnt manage to reduce my opopentts moyos. I'd be grateful if show me where i made mistakes and point out some my bad strategic ideas.

Hi, this is your reviewer!

I think your strategic mistakes were that you did not take care of your groups.  Always make sure that your opponent has more weak groups than you have, and don't start to attack if you think you will weaken your own groups.

When a group has two eyes, it is a very powerful attacking base.]

C[I dont like to play with or against san-rei-sen but i guess the best way to learn is just to try and play it.

---

True :)];W[nc];B[lc]LB[kc:A][jd:C][kd:B]C[This is a bit tight, and will lead to fighting. Something like A,B,C might lead to a looser game]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[oc]LB[jc:A]C[im not sure about this move. i saw something like this in a joseki dictonary a while ago, but i stopped memorising them too much.

---

Well, the important thing about this is that you have to push at A one more time (later on), simply because otherwise you are just creating yourself a weak group.]
;W[jc];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[ld]TR[jc][jd]C[i guess it a good result for black but the marked white wall will be gvery helpful for him to bulid territory at the top.

---

Well, it's a bit weak.  The K17 stone is necessary for white, so I would say he is better off.  It works nicely with the D17 stone.

It's an okay result, as long as you remember the weakness at R17.]

(;B[ce]LB[cn:A][fq:B][jq:C]C[I considered also a,b and c.
maybe a good tactic would be to make a strong group somewhere near to a and then try to do something with white posision at the top. or maybe i am just too much afraid of giving my oppoent any territory :(

Let me examine the possibilities in the variations.

I personally like B best.  It leads to the calmest game.];W[cg]
;B[ee];W[fd]
(;B[bc]LB[dg:B][dh:C][di:A]C[I know this is a bvad move normally, but A or B are going for a fight and with white being strong at the top it could've been hard.

Actually, C is the correct move.];W[cb];B[ci]C[This is shooting for trouble.  Your top stones are not strong enough to start fighting, and the only thing you're going to get is two weak groups, whereas white has only one.]

(;W[eg]C[This move is a mistake - B can (and should!) now connect.]

(;B[fe];W[gd];B[fg]LB[gg:A]C[This is a mistake: remember that touching makes the opponent stronger, attack always from afar.  A would be better.]
;W[fh]
(;B[gg]C[Nonono, if you start to fight, you have to fight.  You have about five stones in the area, w has two.  Cut!  (See variation)

You will need to sacrifice stones, but that's what you chose when playing C11.]
;W[eh];B[ig];W[hi];B[cn]C[W has one weak group.

B just created its third.];W[dn]LB[cl:A]C[This is pretty calm of white :)  I would've played A, I think.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[dk]TR[ci]C[White was wrong here i think. The marked stone was going to be a sacrife and now i got a very strong group and sente]
;W[fq];B[mq];W[jq];B[gl];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[el]C[B is still leading here.]
;W[em]
(;B[dj]C[You are now leaving behind a big weakness at C7.  If you said you were going to sacrifice C11, you should defend your other stones.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[dl];B[cl];W[dm];B[bl];W[bp]C[i dont understand this

---

It prevents you from playing B4 in sente, which takes away the cutting point at B6 and also removes your eye.

Note that the B group has only one eye at the moment, and it can be killed with B10 (except that it can be connected to the other black group.]

(;B[gj]C[I didnt want to capture those stones, just to gain some strength

---

But you should've, because they are cutting stones.];W[gh]
(;B[ik]LB[fj:A]C[This move says "I want to run with my weak groups.  Remember, W can still harrass the left side, and now you are going to give him an opportunity to chase your stones all around the board - and be stronger!

Remember that your top stones don't have two eyes yet either.  W has one weak group, this makes you have two.

You should absolutely capture with A, and then use your strength to harrass the weak white group and reduce the bottom.]

(;B[kl];W[hk]
(;B[hl];W[il]C[Hurts a lot];B[hq]C[major mistake here.];W[jl]
;B[hn]C[This is, in my opinion, the losing move.  You should let those stones go - they are only about 12 points, and after the capture at J9, the white group is alive and those stones serve no useful purpose whatsoever. 

The correct place to play is to protect your own area.  R5 is extremely urgent to prevent an easy white invasion.]
;W[jo];B[ir];W[jr];B[gr];W[fr];B[do];W[eo];B[ep]C[just stupid]
;W[bn];B[fp];W[dr];B[ip];W[jp];B[hs];W[gq];B[gp];W[iq];B[io]
;W[jn]C[white has now won the game, as B has too many weak groups to take care of, and so W can just invade.]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[ah];W[pn]C[This started a big reduction. Please show me how i should have played

---

By my estimation W is already ahead, so it does not really matter.  Losing the middle stones makes w's corner HUGE.

You were lucky in that your opponent did not reduce it more, you actually got more out of the corner than what I expected.

I won't comment on any further, as I think you were losing badly here already.]
