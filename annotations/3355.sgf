;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[cp]C[This is I guess wrong direction, but i was not succesfull to punish it, Ithink. How to do this?

CG: Yes, this is the wrong direction, and I think you were successful in punishing it with C11.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go]
(;B[ci]C[Is c11 good? c10 better?

CG: C11 looks good. Neither C13 nor C9 are very appealing for white now.]
;W[cf];B[cl]C[CG: Now you got the corner territory and your position on the reduces the value of white's thickness to a minimum. You should be satified!]
;W[op];B[oo]C[Is the choice of this joseki ok? What about pincer at n4?

CG: The second question is easier: The pincer would be bad because the lower side is unimportant (neither side can expect to get much territory there).
I would prefer Q6 instead of P5 because there are not so many variations. But P5 looks ok, too.]
;W[np];B[pp]C[CG: Is this the correct move? Q5 looks more natural to me because you can play hane (O6) after white O5.]
;W[no];B[on];W[jd]C[CG: Playing tenuki here looks strange. Black O6 is too painful for white! I think white must continue at N7.]

(;B[nc]C[CG: ??? This looks as if you are answering the largest move on the top with the second largest one - but this way you are loosing points!
I think the right side is more important for black, so I would play O6 and then on the right side (see variation).]
;W[qi]C[CG: This is a good move for white!];B[qk];W[qf];B[rd]
;W[of];B[me]C[CG: This is strange shape. You are trying to attack one of white's groups, but I don't see where you will gain territory by doing so?]
;W[pk];B[pl]C[CG: If you want to ensure getting sente, you should play R8.]

(;B[mh]C[CG: I don't see the meaning of this move. If you want to attack the white stones, just hane at S11. After all, Go is about territory!]
;W[pm];B[ql];W[om];B[qm]C[CG: Ouch. R6 is the move, isn't it?]
;W[rj]
(;B[pn]C[CG: Bad shape again!! At least play O6 first!!!];W[nn]
TR[me][mh][on]C[What is good move for black now?

CG: This is the wrong question! What _were_ the good moves for black _before_?!
Now white's group on the right is safe, the stone on the top is light, and the wall on the bottom right is rock-solid, so white may try to build a big moyo there.
On the other hand, what is the meaning of the marked stones?

White made a mistake in direction on the left side, but now this is more than compensated by some slack moves on the right.

But to answer your question: I think you must do something to against the white moyo. 
I would consider an reducing move (around K7) or invading (K3).]
;B[de]C[CG: I don't know this move.];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec]
;W[db];B[fd];W[gc]C[CG: What is black's plan? Now white's corner is secure and black has a heavy group to look after.]
;B[eb];W[gb]C[CG: This looks heavy for white, too. White should just play G16 or H15.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[je];B[he];W[kb];B[lb];W[ka]C[CG: ??? The peep at J18 hurts!. K18 is also better with regard to territory as it leaves M19 and the aji of N18 (Now M19 is sente for black).]

CG: I don't think black is strong enough to cut.]
