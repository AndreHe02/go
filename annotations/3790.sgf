C[J: This is a game I recently played in a league match. I am black.

N: Hello my comments are marked with 'N'

(;B[fm];W[kq];B[mq]C[J: This moved caused me a lot of trouble later on in the game. Should I have played O3? Or should I have played F7 at K3?

N: If you want to attack the two space extention you have no other choise. B o3 would put no pressure on white. F7 at J4 should be possible too.]
;W[qo]C[N: this looks like an overplay, black attacked the white two-space extention but white plays tenuki. It would be logic to continue attacking.]

(;B[qp];W[po];B[pl]C[J: Is this too passive? Is Q7 better?
N: No Locally this is the best move to attack in a 'kosumi-tsuke' configuration. However you should try to keep white sepperated.]

(;B[mk]LB[ll:A][lm:B]C[N: this is a bad move, these stones are not important, they are not cutting stones. If you want to capture them you sould do this on a larger scale, giving them the opportunity to escape and be chased. Also there are two peeps left at 'A' and 'B' which let white reïnforce later on.]

(;B[dc]C[N: too early, besides white has weak stones floating in the center wich should be attacked first.]
;W[cc]C[N: it is often q good idea to make yourself stronger before attacking]

(;B[hi];W[gi]C[J: What should I do against a play like W G11?

N: my first instinckt is to cutt and try to enclose white]

;W[lf];B[kf];W[jh];B[jj]C[J: I thnk this move was a mistake. Maybe at K9?

N: this can't be a big mistake.];W[ij];B[hg];W[ih];B[fd];W[lk]

(;B[ml];W[lm];B[mm]C[N: here something has gone wrong, it was not important to you to capture the tree white stones, because they where not cutting stones. See variation on node 98 for a more aggressive alternative.]

;W[aq]LB[if:A][ni:B]C[N: In this game you got a quick lead due to a joseki mistake of white. Black didn't get the best result from attacking two weak white groups. After this you captured three useless stones and later on let white reïnforce and spend another two moves to capture these stones (so in total this meant you played three two-point gote moves in the middle of the game! You continued to let reduce yourself at 'A' and 'B'. 
In the end you where ahead, but you could have made things easier by connecting underneath. After destroying the territory in the lower left you where ahead even more, but you played bad shape.]
