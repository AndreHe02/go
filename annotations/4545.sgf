C[I played black in this game, with 1 handicap. KGS system rated me 12k, which seems a bit too strong... (I played rated games only with some bots before). However, the game was close - well, until White killed one of my groups because of a stupid mistake.
Could you tell me where I could have played better? What should I work on?

Thanks for reviewing this game!

(;B[ec]C[playing the 3rd line, means that you want territory. dont forget the power of infuence.]

(;B[dj]C[stop stop stop.

you are playing to much for your territory. 

Please think this way:
I dont want to make territory, I only dont want that my opponent gets territory. so... k4 for you would be better tan d10.]

(;B[jd]C[now you are really overconcentrated. you should search your opponents weak points and not only yours. your right und left upper corners are save! Now its really time to attack.]

You should try to play more characteristic sequences. Like  typical fuseki or joseki. Maybe watching pro games would help here. If you learn them, you will know too how to punish wrong moves!

Your joseki or fuseki is too maybe to unplaned. You should be more flexible and not play to much for territory. Influence is important too.
