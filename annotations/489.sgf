reviewed by shadow (4k nngs) for jpyllman];W[nq];B[oq];W[np]
;B[pn]
(;W[gp];B[fq]C[jpyllman: Have no clue how to play in the begining of a high handicap game as this. G3 as I play in the game feels too slow. Lets black get strong. Should I play something like C6 as I show in the variation. Or should I play elsewhere.

shadow: The goal for white in a high handicap game is to seperate Black into smaller groups so that each one fights on his own.  White should try to seperate black into 9 seperate battles.  Whites superior fighting skill should then win the game for him.  blacks goal is to link his stones together and keep white small.

shadow: Thus G4 is a fine handicap move, it's loose and probably nothing Black has seen before, he's on unfamiliar ground and that is whites goal]

(;W[gq]C[shadow:  The corner is still open and the K4 stone seems isolated]
;B[dm]C[shadow: this is way too lose.  the corner is wide open for attack.  Aji for later that white can exploit.]
;W[jn]C[shadow: good for a handicap games.  The intent is to confuse Black and capture K4 on a big scale.  Or force it to run so that you can move your stones into other positions to cut black apart.  This is a bogus attack of course, but hopefully black is confused and fights poorly.  If he fights well, then this should not have been a 8 stone game in the first place.]

(;W[hp];B[hs];W[jr];B[hq]
(;W[jq];B[fp]C[shadow: huge gain for black];W[df]C[shadow: this is probably the wrong direction.  Black is thick in the lower left and white doesn't want to fight down there.  Better to play in such a way that black gets over concentrated or provides you with another target.  I think R14 is best.  It works indirectly with whites thickness in bottem middle.  Black won't want to chase white in the direction so white will have an easier time of it.]
;B[cg]C[shadow: F16 is the proper move for black here];W[ec]
C[shadow: this is the correct direction but a bit too tight.  When fighting a high handicap game, play loser and allow the opponent to make mistake.  When you fight tightly you practicly point out the proper move for black to play.]

(;W[ef]C[shadow: why is D14 important that you must invest more stones to save it?  Because it's not important at all.  It doesn't cut black into two weak groups, it doesn't claim territory, it doesn't make eyes]

(;B[ob]C[jpyllman: Not realy nessesary I think. Black should play somewhere else where there are more points. N16 might even be localy better. Stealing one eye from white.

shadow: Not true.  White could get a ko before, but now he is dead.]
;W[nb];B[qc];W[qq]C[shadow: this is an end game move.  There are still bigger points on the board to pursue.  The white stone on the top  are still in trouble on both sides.  Black has got way too much territory on left and right as well.  white needs to be active on the right side I think and try to rescue white stones on the top somehow]
