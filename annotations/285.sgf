C[This game I
played Black and I won by 8.5 pts.

Joshua:
It is one of the best examples I've seen for a while of a player
with a sure win getting a bit too greedy and almost losing.
Black still did manage to pull it off in the end ... but if white
had just ignored that first black ko threat?

The big lesson here is to COUNT carefully when you have a big
strategic decision to make, and if you are way ahead, feel free
to play a small defensive move.  Defending is the most important
part of go!  Once your groups are safe, then you can attack all-out,
and while attacking, you will naturally gain territory.  Worry about
your weak groups more than anything else!

Of course it is possible to go overboard in that direction, but with
a 40 point lead....
Besides, once you've defended all your groups thoroughly, it'll be a lot
easier for you to take territory later and a lot harder for your opponent,
since you'll have nothing to worry about and your opponent will have nothing
to attack.

Joshua];B[pd];W[dq];B[dc];W[qo];B[do]C[This move looks like the
right direction to work with D17.  It feels better than C5
would.];W[pq]C[This looks like a slack move for white; a pincer at C7
perhaps would be better.];B[cq]C[I think F4 or F5 would be better; press
white low and reduce the influence of the corner enclosure white just made.]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[fq]C[This low move for white is not very appealing.  E2 takes away
black's sente at B2, so black has to extend and then white can play at G4
instead, much more effective with the corner enclosure.];B[ck]
C[White has
failed to use the corner enclosure in the lower right.  But black (by
attaching at C3 instead of playing F4/5) has made an extension that's too
far away from the D17 stone.  This joseki would work better if that stone
were at D16 or D15 so that C9 is the right distance.];W[ce]
C[White jumps in
immediately since D15 would be very nice for black.];B[ch]C[This pincer is
good but it is extending from an already-live position and white will be
able to get settled in the corner... perhaps D13 is more
interesting?];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc]C[Is B17 joseki?  D16 looks like the key
point.  If black plays B17, white can play E17 and trade the corner for the
outside.];B[dd];W[dg];B[cg];W[de];B[fd];W[bb];B[jd]C[This exchange looks good for black.  There is
still some future attack if black connects at D18 later.];W[hd]
C[This
invasion looks too aggressive.  Why not play on the right side (say, R11,
or R14)];B[ee];W[ef];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe]C[Hm, is F15 necessary, or would G16 or H15 work better?  My
reading ability isn't giving me a clear answer to that
question.];W[ie];B[hf];W[je];B[kd];W[nd]C[White is trying to complicate
things because white is losing.  If black can keep this stone separated
from the other upper white group, black should get a good
position.];B[oc]C[This might be the wrong direction.  L15 instead,
attacking both groups at once?  Also usually if you are going to play from
this side, Q17 makes much better shape for attacking than P17, because then
white has no way to counterattack the corner.];W[mc];B[hc]C[This looks much fancier than it needs to be.  Black is
stronger than white here, so black doesn't need to link up; L15 or N15 or
something like that is the right idea (separate white and head out into
the center).  You only need to link up when your stones are weak.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[jg];B[le]C[Now black plays M15 but black is a move behind in
the center fighting since white already jumped to K13.
If black played M15 right away, white wouldn't have taken away the
connection, so black could still play H17 later.];W[nf];B[pf]
;W[qh]C[Another overplay for white.  Wouldn't a move like M14
do a lot?  L18 is now almost sente for white, plus if black cuts off O16
there's always the corner.  (That's why Q17 is usually better than P17).]
;B[og]C[Good!  Don't think of the corner territory, think of splitting
white and attacking.];W[mg]C[Here again black pays the price for not having jumped out in the
center first.];B[kf];W[ig];B[lh];W[mh];B[li];W[lg];B[kg];W[kh]
;B[ke];W[mi];B[jh];W[ki];B[lj];W[kj];B[mj]C[Could black play L9 instead?  My reading ability
is not enough to be sure, but it looks like you'll get to play N10 "for
free" while white is busy saving his three stones.  But you do give up the
aji of K12 ...];W[nj];B[kk]C[If you're going to play L9 anyway, better to do it first.
Why trade N10/O10?  I suppose it doesn't really matter in the end, the
moves probably transpose.];W[lk];B[mk];W[jk];B[ll];W[ii];B[oi]
C[That white stone at R12 sure looks like a mistake now!  Black
did a good job of ignoring the corner territory and focusing on the fight
when white made that overplay.];W[ni];B[pj];W[ok];B[qj]C[Hm, Q9 is a much more severe attack on the big
white group.  The one white stone at R12 is light; white can play R17
later.  R10 is showing black looking at the side territory too much and at
the attack not enough.];W[kl];B[oe];W[me];B[ol];W[nl];B[kq]
C[Huh?
This move is crazy!
Is black going to sacrifice all those stones in the center which are busy
splitting white in two?  M7!  Or cut at K8 and fight the ko!  L3 is
meaningless.];W[ml];B[hq]C[White lives at any time by playing B2, so it
will take a lot to surround and kill this group.  Even if black plays B2
white can answer at E2 and is still mostly alive.

If white plays at N3, it's still not clear that black's stones on the
bottom are good, since white has a huge center strength now.]
;W[qc]C[I
think N3 is better for white; use the corner enclosure, maintain the
balance of power on the bottom so the white lower left group doesn't get
too weak.];B[qd];W[rc]C[I think white has to play S16 here to have any chance of
living.  it doesn't look like quite enough room.];B[rd];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[ra];B[sb];W[sc];B[rb];W[pa];B[qb];W[pc];B[od]C[isn't white dead now?
Hmmmm... white needed to stretch out a bit more.

More to the point, N3 would have been better for white in the first place.
Or try an invasion like D6 or D8 or C7... white needs to use the center
strength!];W[kb];B[jb];W[kc];B[jc]C[This is small territory.  N3 is big; black's two stones on
the bottom could become weak.];W[gc]C[This doesn't look possible for white.
Even if the cut works the capturing race doesn't look
promising.];B[gd];W[gb];B[hb];W[eb];B[db];W[fc];B[ec];W[fa]
;B[ha]C[When all the liberties are filled in black will need to be a
little bit careful... but white wasted a lot of ko threats here and in the
upper right corner.  Maybe K8 becomes possible?  Oh, I see, even if black
K8 white can just play O9 and black still loses five stones (but gets a
ponnuki).];W[mq]C[Finally white finds the big move.];B[er]C[This is a
severe attack, good!  It might be interesting for white to try E2 and see
if the two black stones in the middle are weak enough to be captured.
White doesn't look like getting enough territory
otherwise.];W[dr];B[fr]C[Black's group looks pretty safe now, and white's
is weak.  So C2 was a mistake for white.];W[eq];B[gq];W[bq]
;B[bp];W[fo];B[dm]C[Now white has no chance to invade the left side or kill the
bottom black stones; the game is over.  White got strength in the center
but can't use it to attack
anything.];W[ar];B[bs];W[br];B[hh];W[ih];B[bf];W[be];B[cf];W[df]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[dj];W[fi];B[gh];W[fh];B[ho]C[black is
doing a nice job of making sure white's center doesn't get too big.  Very
safe and calm.];W[fm];B[qm]C[A big endgame move.];W[lm]C[A fairly small move for white,
since he always has O9...];B[pr]C[Why take chances on dying and increasing
white's territory?  Just play on the outside. like S6 and L5 and M2, to
ensure an easy win.

Let's count:
black has 40+ on the right side, 12 or so  on the upper side, and 20+ on
the left side, and if you play M2 followed by L5 next or some such thing,
probably 10+ on the bottom, total well over 80.

White, meanwhile, has 15+ on the lower right corner, maybe a few in the
lower left corner, a few more in the upper left corner, and maybe 20+ in
the center: total at most 45-50.

Black has a sure win on territory.

The only way black can get in trouble is by starting a fight.

So, don't start one, don't try to take away white's territory; you don't
need to.  Just defend your weakest group, which looks like the bottom one.

White's center strength is useless if it has no targets to attack.]
;W[or];B[qq];W[qr];B[pp];W[oq];B[rr];W[ps];B[qp];W[pn];B[ro]
C[...but it looks like black gains some points
here...];W[pl];B[ql];W[es];B[gs];W[ir]C[...but white's attack has some
potential!];B[jq];W[lr]C[... it would have been simpler to just play on the outside and make
your group stronger while limiting white's
territory!];B[kr];W[ds];B[hr];W[is];B[js];W[gp];B[iq];W[fs]
;B[ko]C[if you
had played here at the beginning, instead of on the lower right corner,
there would not have been any attack for white.  Remember, a move that
defends your group might not take much territory right away, but in the
long run it prevents your opponent from getting territory in sente while
attacking you.];W[lp];B[kp];W[io];B[lq];W[mr];B[gn];W[in];B[ip]

;W[kn];B[lo];W[mp];B[mo];W[no];B[ao];W[mn]C[this capturing race might get serious!
Black has taken some big chances by letting this fight start.

Don't be afraid to defend weak groups!  Even in the endgame, that can be
more important than territory.];B[dp];W[ln];B[ep];W[ls];B[ks]
;W[hs];B[jr];W[is];B[as];W[hs];B[gr];W[jp];B[aq]C[the whole game, which was
very good for black, now might hinge on a ko?  White has a big success
here.];W[en];B[em];W[ap];B[if]C[isn't this threat too small?  wasn't black already alive up
there?  This just gets ten points or so?  Maybe I'm missing
something?];W[jf]C[Well, white answered anyway.];B[aq];W[gm]
C[White is
gaining points here even if he loses the ko (the center territory gets
bigger).  Very good choice of ko threats.];B[dn];W[ap];B[jj]
C[Now THAT is a big ko threat.  Lots of groups could
live or die depending on whether white answers this one.];W[lk]
;B[aq];W[hn];B[en];W[ap];B[ji];W[ij]C[Black's ko threats also ended up giving
white a few points... white profits during the ko
fight.];B[aq];W[oa];B[ap]C[Even winning the ko, black gets only seki. What
a big gain for white!  Along with all the points gained during the fight,
white has a game now.

Black needed to COUNT back at move 143 (the invasion of the lower right).
Black didn't need those points; black was way way way ahead; so take a
small gote move that makes your groups strong!

AFTER you are strong, then invade.];W[nb];B[sd]C[Maybe the biggest endgame point... compare it to F8 and see
what you think.];W[rs];B[sr];W[gi];B[he]C[A good way to defend the shortage of liberties
here and make sure that white's stones around F19
die.];W[qn];B[rn];W[pm];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[gl];B[ba];W[ab]

;B[bh];W[cd];B[ka]C[is M18 possible instead with the
weakness at O17?  looks like it is to me ... but maybe I'm missing
something.];W[la];B[ja];W[lc];B[oo];W[on];B[lf];W[aa];B[ga]
;W[ca];B[da];W[of];B[pg];W[ld];B[ne];W[mf];B[nc];W[md]C[If only you hadn't played L19, wouldn't N18 be nice now?

here.];B[hi];W[hj];B[ba];W[ek];B[el];W[ca];B[mb];W[na];B[ba]
;W[ah];B[ai];W[ca];B[oj];W[ba];B[rq];W[qs];B[gg];W[cs];B[as]
;W[bs];B[ir];W[is];B[hs]C[I think the big lesson of this game
is to COUNT.

In the endgame, defending your weak groups is as important as attacking
your opponent's.  Territory is not as important even in the ending!  What
would have happened if white had ignored your J14 ko threat?

Count how many points you lost in the lower center: your group ended up
with no points when it looked like it could be ten, you lost a few more
making your ko threats in the middle of the board, and a few more when
white gained points making his ko threats, and finally you ignored a white
ko threat worth thirty points or more, plus you then had to play T16 as
well so white kept sente!  All told, certainly over 50 points.

In exchange you took the bottom right corner, maybe 15 or 20 points.

So just think how far ahead you were before you played there: 30 or 40
points at least.

Defend!!!!!])
