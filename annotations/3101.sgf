C[Dear reviewer,
I played black this game. You may wonder about the game because my opponent resigned in a very late stadium but in my opinion he missed a move to save his group.
Otherwise it was a very hard game for me. After the first 50 moves I felt I had a little advantage but then my opponent cought up and step by step I lost more and more terrain.
Please give me some hints where I made the biggest mistakes.
Thank you in advance.

Thomas

Hi Thomas,

I will try to do my best to explain where it went wrong for you.

slowly];B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[jc]C[I would expect W4 around the upper left corner,  keeping balance in the whole board.]

(;B[cc]C[Bigger, I aggree. I thought about something else in the openning too.]
;W[qe]
(;B[qd]C[I think to play a pincer would be  more consistent for B in this situation.
 
My arguments are 

1) thanks to WK17 you can make only few territory in the upper right corner, and you allow W to settle easily in the right side. 

2) with an attach-and-extend joseki, both sides get stronger, but W gets stronger in "your" area.

3) often B ends loosing the initiative.];W[pe]
(;B[nc]
(;W[ed];B[ce];W[ef]
(;B[ne]C[Because of WK17, B cannot expect to obtain any large territory on the upper side. 
I think this move only helps W's two stones on the right side to settle down easily.

Check my variation];W[pi]C[Now W is happy because B reminded him to protect its weakness. It is difficult for me to find a good move for B now.]

(;B[qn]C[A very tight move. Why so defensive? If the W group in the upper right side were very strong, this move makes sense for me. At least BR7 (maybe the checking extension at R9) would be  better. Switching to the lower right side seems also ok for me.]
;W[jq]C[very natural for me, with little effort W is taking a large point while impeding the extension of B's shimari in the lower right corner towards the lower center and quickly developing from its side.]

(;B[dg]C[I think this move is slow, and it allows a weakness of the cut at C14. I prefer the checking extension at C6]
;W[ck]C[Maybe better at O11, but seems ok for me too];B[ci]
C[this is very tight again. So if you foresaw the weakness of the cut, why did you provoke it?]
;W[ej]C[I think C4, D4 are larger enough for W to keep the lead.]
;B[fh]C[this move is important, as it gives a B a small chance to attack W's upper left group while making profit.]

(;W[gg]C[I dont see much use in this move. W is open to the upper left corner.]

(;B[qk]C[big, but slow again. I'm not sure your putting much pressure against W's O15-O11 group]
;W[mp]C[
W wants to provoke you to invade into the lower left corner.]

(;B[cq]C[A safe way to invade. I am not sure this is the best way to do it, because your are allowing W to seal you quickly. I would have tried from the right side.]

(;W[cp]C[It is bigger to block from the right side. This can be painful for W]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq]C[W allowed B to live too easily here,]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[ok]C[this is ok  for me];W[ri];B[gh]
;W[hg];B[ni];W[nh]
(;B[mi]C[This is ok too because it affects W's moyo on the left side. I would have capped  here to surround W's group easier.]
;W[ng];B[mn]C[Should I have been more couragious, maybe g9

g9 allows W to cut black stones at E12, since there are many B stones outside, maybe the fight is favorable for B.]
;W[hk];B[kn];W[io];B[jk];W[il]
(;B[jl]C[I was satisfied with this.
My plan was to reduce whites moyo at the upper side with helb of the both corner groups.
But in the next moves white got an advantage.



I would have played somewhere else instead of just closing a fence. Maybe P3 aiming M4 afterwards, that way at least you keep W busy.]
;W[oo]C[this a good move, and you have to be cautious with it]

(;B[no]C[The cut  here does not work because there is a lot of space for W to live in the lower right corner.]
;W[op];B[np];W[oq]
(;B[pq];W[nq]C[I ended  with gote.

and you fell in your own trap.];B[on]
(;W[bi]C[W should have continued reducing at O5];B[ch];W[bj]

(;B[bh]C[i think O5 is much larger, you are defending around 5 points here.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[kd]
(;B[jf]C[I believe it was better for B to keep connected at O16 and stronger in the upper corner. O5 may be decisive for the game now.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[oe]C[this should be painful for B];B[rd]
(;W[re]C[this is ok, but W could already start picking up a larger fight in the center, and can profit with O5 too.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mh];W[mg];B[kg];W[ke];B[kf]C[I think just to connect at M14 is painful enough, this makes bad shape]

(;W[po]C[this is huge, it destroys your moyo. I bet this move is definitively worth around 15 points if not 20. You can compare the difference if B played here instead.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[oh];W[lf]C[White is punishing your bad shape and living easily on the side, so I don't see much use in B87.]

(;C[Result: B+Resign

I think that you lost the game because of several reasons:


1) at the begging you played too tight around the corners, allowing your opponent to settle very easily. You should try  to handle some pincer moves in the opening. 

2) You appear to be not prepared to handle a fight implying an exchange of territories. 

3) You need to be careful of your shapes and of your opponent's during a fight. Maybe this was the major reason. You made many mistakes and lost some big opportunities in the middle- and endgame.


W took advantage from the beggining. W was not afraid for an invasion, and was more prepared for an exchange of terrritory than B. Maybe that was the reason that he played with less pressure.

You were lucky to win the game though, and showed fighting spirit at the end. You should instead concentrate building up fights in the middle game, where the chances are better.

I hope I did not miss the point too much in my comments
