C[Dear reviewer,

In this game I played black against a slightly stronger opponent and in the end won by 2.5 points (thanks to reverse komi). I'd appreciate any comments about my play and pointers as to how to improve. Thank you for reviewing my game!

Jaakko

B: Your game was well chosen for reviewing. You played a good game, but there are certain points, were you could do better. My main point is about your attacking style: The right way to attack is usually from a certain distance. If you place your stones to close to the attacked group (for example you attach), those stones might become themselves targets for attack. You have to worry about them and cannot continue your attack. That is what the proverb "attaching strengthens your oponent" means. 

The goal for an attack is usually not to kill oponents group but to let it live small thereby building influence or making territory.

Here is something I copied form a book, about a player who changed his style in that direction: "he had learned to exchange the pleasure of making the enemy die big for the subtler pleasure of making him live small." You are not a killer either, so this sentence doesnt fit perfectly well, but nevertheless I think it is a good sentence.

The sentence is from the book "Attack and Defence" by Ishida and Davies (Kiseido) which I recommend for you.

All my comments start with a B:];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[nc]
;W[qi];B[ql]C[Perhaps this should have been one step closer? R9 perhaps?

B: No, that is the right distance. Your move is good!];W[qf]
;B[qo]C[Is this too small? I wanted to settle the corner once and for all, but this seems too slow.

B: This is indeed not good. P8 is better. You would then welcome an attack of white at R5 as you would get a nice target for an attack. It is the wrong idea to settle corners early. Another option instead of R5 would be K4.]
;W[kq]C[B: The right move! If white would allow you to play K4 you would have a good position. In a certain sense L3 is refuting your play at R5.]
;B[de]C[Should I have first played a move against W R11 group? It seems it would be sente.

B: I think your move is good.
An attack against the R11 group is possible as well. As white P15 is sente you should start that attack with P14. I am not really sure if you would end in sente if you would start this attack.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[ce];B[cf]C[Is this the right direction? I was thinking of trying to get a wall facing right side, but I was afraid of W left side getting too big so decided to play this.

B: It is the right direction.];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[B: The game looks even to me.]
;W[ne];B[kc]C[B: To far. You leave a weakness at N17 behind.]
;W[mc]C[B: Good!];B[mb];W[md];B[lb];W[cl];B[ck];W[dl];B[fq]
C[Don't know if this invasion point is 'right', but at least the result seemed to be.

B: Your move is good!];W[dq]C[B: Wrong direction. White should play H3. This way you get to much.]
;B[iq]C[B: Good!];W[nq];B[kp]C[Extending too far?

B: Attaching is not good. The white group is weak. By attaching you strengthen it. A move like J5 builds up a better attack and strengthens your own group. I would have played L5 here. If white K4 you jump to H5 strengthening your group.

If you consider this move L4 as an attacking move you have to think about attacking in general anew. In general the good attacking moves are from a distance (like encircling the endangered group). If you are playing to close, your own stones become vulnerable (you are strengthening your oponent). Only very late in the attack, when you are realling going to kill you might consider close contact moves. 
Usually the goal of an attack is not to kill the group, but to build influence or territory while attacking. Forcing white to live small is usually considered a good result out of an attack.]
;W[jq];B[jp]C[you should play J4 here, treating your stone L4 light]
;W[lp]C[B: White J2 is far stronger. as it attacks your group.]
;B[hp]C[B: Good move!];W[lo];B[eo]C[ladder breaker

B: There is no ladder. But this might be difficult to see.]
;W[do];B[en];W[fl];B[pe];W[pf];B[of]C[This cut was perhaps a bit premature. Instead of being able to mount any serious attack on either side I ended up having one weak group in the middle myself.

B: The variation shows how white captures the cutting stone. So you are right the cut is not good.]

(;W[og];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[io]C[strange move. I think I would have ignored it as P12 is so big.]

(;B[ip];W[oh];B[mg];W[lf]C[B: Because white answered your cot wrongly you are not yet in a bad position here]
;B[lg]C[B: This is the wrong direction! 
Which white group would you want to attack after your cut? Clearly the group around N14. So you should not strengthen it by pushing along row 13. Jump to O11 instead! The white group would be in trouble then. 

This again is the same theme as before: Usually the strong attacking moves are at a certain distance to the attacked group. Do not play contact moves as an attack.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if]C[B: You helped the white group escape. This result is rather horrible for black (I think you realised that yourself). Now white has a target for attack.]
;B[fj]C[Don't really know what I was trying to accomplish here.

B: the position is difficult for black now. I think you try to prepare an escape route for your endangered stones in the middle. But white should be able to cut through.]
;W[ig];B[mj]C[Another move that seems to accomplish nothing. Wanted to get out from there and get nearer to the corner group, but this move does not seem good to me now.

B: The move is good! It was necessary. It is now your group which is under attack and that move is the right way to escape.]
;W[ij];B[pj]C[B: Good!];W[qe];B[pd];W[oj];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph]
;W[pg];B[qh]C[B: Very good for you! Now there is a white group which you might be able to attack! Good!]
;W[mi];B[li];W[mh];B[ih]C[B: Very dangerous! White should cut through with M12.]

(;W[hh];B[ii];W[hi];B[jj]C[B: Here you lost your chance to attack the white group. You should have played M9, attacking the white group on the right. The stones around H11 and J11 are not important.]
;W[lj];B[ik];W[hj];B[kj];W[lk];B[jl];W[mk];B[jn];W[lm]C[B: You barely managed to escape. A bad result for black.]
;B[cm]C[Too early?

B:  The endgame begins, as there is no attackable group on the board. The only remaining big point is H17 for black (J17 for white). So: Yes: It is to small.]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[dn];B[bl];W[bo];B[an]C[B: this is wrong. Your weakness is the cut at B7 as the variation shows. Play B6 to defend this weakness.]

(;W[pr]C[Should I have player here first?

B: This is big, but I think J17 is bigger.
Maybe the best for white would be to play P2 which black might answer and play J17 then. So for you the best would have been to play P2 first and then turn to H17.]

(;B[qr]C[B: The big question is: can you hane inward with P2? I think this is possible, but it is rather complicated. You are a little bhind in the game, but given the reverse Komi the game is still even, so your move is reasonable. If this would be an even game here would be a chance to catch up.]
;W[or];B[ff]C[Trying to get a cut.];W[eh];B[hg]C[Should have played G9 (or the like) first? That way the cut might have worked.

B: If you need 2 moves to prepare a cut  then you better just forget about it: white ignores the first one and defends the cut after your second move. All you would have achieved is losing a move.
Your move is the right one! Reason: you are attacking two groups with this cut.]
;W[gk];B[hd]C[B: This is the right idea! The shoulder hit G16 would have been the right move. White is in trouble after G16]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[gf];B[fg];W[gd];B[ge]C[Misread. Should have played something like H17-18? Would have made some territory in sente.

B: This is right! H17 would have been good!];W[he];B[fe];W[id]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[hb];W[ib];B[fd]C[Well, these moves are not useful. Just basically losing some ko threats without any real gain.

B: In fact the whole sequence is a loss for you as white got all these nice stones J16,17,18. But you realised that yourself]
;W[gc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[gb];B[fh]C[B: At least you proved E12 to be the wrong move.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[ch];W[rr]C[B: white is getting the big endgame points.]
;B[rq];W[qs];B[qq];W[nd];B[rd]C[B: Very good! white O16 was a mistake. He wanted you to defend with P18 or so.]
;W[re];B[pk]C[Doesn't seem to be necessary, and not even the best move locally.
B: You are right.];W[sd];B[rc];W[sc];B[sb];W[se];B[qb];W[on]
;B[er]C[B: Good! A big point. The biggest on the board.];W[dr]
;B[hk]C[B: Not a good sequene you are starting here. You might lose more points around E11 then you are win in the center.
Big moves now are K2, D1 (sente) and Q6.];W[gj];B[gl];W[gm]
