GC[Close game. Hinged on a tough ko battle]

C[I played as black.  My analysis is that I gainned a lead after a large ko.  I think I was outplayed in the endgame, but not by enough to lose my lead.

NM: commented here by Niall 2k*];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]
C[I opened with the high chinese to try and create a large-scale moyo.  White opened with niren-sei.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[jp]C[NM: Good!];W[dj]C[He forms sanren-sei.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[dr]C[NM: too small. Better either as Q5 or an
attack at the top somewhere from F17 to
J17.];W[cq]C[NM; Bad. If W is going to reply (I wouldn't)
he must at least first play something like  G5 to push B down.]
;B[qo]C[Is this the best enclosure?

NM; Very difficult to judge. You can't take
everything with one move, and given that
I would prefer Q5, since this leaves
possibilities for W round M3/N4. On the
other hand this does make sure of the
corner.];W[pb];B[qc]C[NM: same comment applies to B R17,
although less strongly since W L16 is
a little closer.];W[mq];B[kq]C[NM: I think I would attack from above
with something like N5, but it's a difficult
question. Certainly this attack is powerful;
the only problem is that it pushes him into
your moyo.];W[mo];B[fc]C[Should I have kept attacking? Or is playing tenuki ok?

NM: Playing tenuki like this is not  completely impossible - territorially the
swap L3/N5 is clearly to B's advantage. However I wouldn't do it yet. It seems
to me that a capping move like N8 is going
to give B useful extra strength and moyo
possibilities in the TR, while not closing
off other possibilities later.];W[hc]C[NM: Since the corner is completely open,
and the W top is strong, I would atack from
the other side, with D17 or E17.];B[fe]C[NM: For the reasons I give above, I would
dive into the corner now with C17. But this
is playable.];W[df];B[he]C[NM: the other possibility is J16, but I
like this better.];W[id];B[db]C[NM: I don't like this. It doesn't
fully secure the B stones, and it throws
away any possibility later of playing C17.
I would play F12 and then tenuki if W
replies on the side. But this is also a
matter of style.];W[cc];B[me]C[Is this an effective way to expand my moyo?

NM: Looks good to me.  Only perhaps play N8 first?];W[gd]C[NM: too agressive - W would do much better
to attack from outside, for example at K12.];B[fd];W[ge];B[gf]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[gc]C[NM: B sacrifice is good.];W[hd];B[fg]
;W[ne]C[NM: not good. As we see, this ends up  strengthening B.]
;B[nf];W[oe];B[of];W[md];B[lf];W[le];B[mf];W[pm]C[NM: I can see the logic, but I must admit
I don't like it. I would jump straight out,
e.g. to N8, and then aim at R7, which
is the key point for attacking this shape.];B[qm]C[NM: The peaceable answer. O6 and P6 are
other possibilities.];W[pn];B[qn];W[oq];B[op]C[NM: I would just have played Q4 here.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[nm];B[nk];W[lm];B[jm]C[NM: This move is OK, but not my style.  While there is always something unpleasant
in inviting your opponent to close you in,
of the two possible attacks - this one and
M9 - the latter actually gives you
territory amd in that sense is preferable.
However, on balance I think that  I would first play P2, and then attack
at E12. Depending on what happened to that,
I might later want to play M9 rather
than this move.];W[pr];B[or]C[This starts the firt ko of the game.

NM: Only possible reply - good!];W[nr];B[nq];W[ef];B[ff];W[oq]
;B[lk]C[I decided to not try and play a ko threat and instead just take some more territory.

NM: I can understand that, but W's capture
is big. Shows how necessary P2 was.];W[os];B[qq];W[kh];B[lh]
C[Was this response to passive?  Should I have cut off this stone?

NM: That would have been better, given the
immense thickness of your wall. But this
is not bad.];W[ki];B[li];W[ii];B[gi]C[NM: A bit cramped. I would have played
at F10...];W[fj]C[NM: ... as W did.];B[gj];W[hh];B[gh];W[hq]
C[I thought that a deep invasion here was an overplay.

NM: I think you're right - but that doesn't
mean that it's easy to counter it.];B[gp]C[Was the shoulder hit an appropriate attack?

NM: My preferred move would be F5, but this
might work too.];W[hp];B[ho]C[NM: Now that definitely seems like an
overplay to me - see the variant.]

(;B[hr]C[Is starting a ko my best option?

NM: See variant. It looks to me as if  you can win without the ko, but there
may be other lines available.];W[kr];B[iq];W[qf]C[I think taking the ko is much bigger than this threat.  Is this correct?  I also think he could have used this stone better than he did after I took the ko.

NM: Yes, I agree that taking the ko
is bigger - and I also agree with your
second statement. But the problem about
ko is that you also have to think about
other possible threats if you answer this
one. Clearly W has local threats, such as K8; given that, I would do as you did and
resolve the ko.];B[gq]
(;W[qe]C[NM: I think W has to play this - see
variant.];B[pe];W[qd];B[pc];W[rc];B[qg]C[NM: At this point, I think W should play
S13.];W[qb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[rf];W[re];B[se];W[rd]
;B[rg];W[el]
(;B[dh]C[NM: See variant. I think you can invade  more deeply. Maybe you don't have to.
B has 53 points on the R and 32
(including prisoners) on the bottom.
W has 41 on the L and 30 at the top.
The remaining two groups have little territory. So if you come out of this
with sente and manage to take both
C18 and C2 you should be very comfortably ahead.];W[ch];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[di];W[ci];B[fk]C[NM: Certainly not the biggest point
on the board. I would play C2.];W[ek];B[fi];W[cr];B[ej]C[NM: should be C18]
;W[er];B[ig];W[jg];B[jf];W[kf];B[ie];W[je];B[eq]C[NM: Nice attack in sente.]
;W[dq];B[fr]C[NM: even now, C18 is bigger.];W[cb];B[dc];W[qr]
C[NM: also big.];B[sd];W[rb];B[hb];W[ib];B[ha];W[ia];B[gb];W[rq]
;B[rp];W[sr]C[NM: despite the nice attack at J13, this
has been very poor for B. W's L side has
grown to 57 points, and his lower side
from about 5 to 11. B's L is now 51, and the
8 points gained in the centre are barely
enough to keep B ahead.

The rest of the endgame was reasonable,
save that B should have played J14, since
given the weakness at K17 it was sente.
