;B[pd]C[RickMott: Hello -- sorry this took so long (sick kids, mostly)

My most general comment on reviewing the game is that you are too quick to attack or invade, without making your own positions secure first.

When all of your groups are stable, then you can think about attack or invasion.  Otherwise, you end up trying to defend several weak groups at once.  Even if you succeed, you will find your opponent has developed a big lead while you scramble to make life everywhere.

Look for moves with two purposes.  If you can find a move that strengthens one of your positions while threatening your opponent, that is ideal -- much better than just making a big territorial play or an invasion.  You must expect to end invasions in gote, so make sure there are no dual-purpose moves left first.

Good luck in the future!

    Rick Mott];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[nc]C[RickMott: It is unusual not to respond locally to Black's slide at D18, since allowing black to take C17 is too good.  White C17 is the standard play here.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb]C[RickMott:  Continuing the standard 3-3 invasion with S15 etc. might be reasonable here.  Your stone at O17 prevents black from getting the normal tiger's mouth protecting the cut at P17, maybe giving you a shot at taking the cut at Q15.]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[nb];B[oa];W[pe]C[RickMott: Too soon for this.  Your two stones are too weak.  Play O16 first, preventing black from using that to connect to his M17 stone.  Then the cut is a real threat.]
;B[nd]C[RickMott: See? Your two stones can't escape now, and black will win the capturing race.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[qf]C[so far so good nothing unusual untill

RickMott: This is OK for you, black has been forced into an inefficient shape.  You have compensation for losing the two stones.]
;B[ch]C[black C12

RickMott: No trouble, when you didn't defend the corner with C17 these stones became light.  They are now most useful for reducing black's moyo, not making territory.]

(;W[cc]C[now here I really am puzzled what the right respons is..

RickMott: Jump to F15 to reduce black's potential, or sacrifice a stone at E18.  See variation.]
;B[cb];W[bb]C[This brought me trouble think B17 would have been better

RIckMott: with black at C12, you can't make eyes here easily.  Better to jump out at F15.]
;B[bd];W[bf]C[now my group is in serious trouble

RickMott: you must connect at B17 instead.  You can still jump out easily enough.  Black will be forced to link back to C12.  If you connect, you can make an eye in the corner later too (hane at C19 is sente because of the black cut at E18).]
;B[bc]C[RickMott: This is not good for you.  Black got to catch B18 and destroy your eye space in sente.]
;W[ce]C[RickMott: It's not obvious, but I think connecting at either D17 or C16 would be better.  You would get to threaten black's two stones on one side or the other.  Then either jump out at F15 or pincer at C10.]
;B[cl];W[cj]C[RickMott: Your upper group is not strong enough to support a splitting attack yet.  Strengthen it first.]
;B[eh];W[di]C[also here I dont have a strategy, may be plying D12 was better

RickMott: The problem is not this move, but making the D10 invasion before.

I'll make my first general comment: you need to stabilize your weak positions before invading or attacking.  Defense first.  It's the old martial arts axiom: you can't punch very hard standing on one foot.

After black connects, you will have two weak groups to look after.  You must jump out with the top now, or black gets a large moyo at the top while forcing your upper left group to defend itself.]
;B[dh];W[cn]C[RickMott: This move doesn't defend either of your weak groups, and actually forces black to jump out (making your 2 stone group even weaker).]
;B[el];W[dk]C[this went all wrong];B[dl];W[fj];B[ej]C[RIckMott: Now black is being too aggressive when he doesn't need to be.  It's good enough for him to play E11 in sente and chase you while building a huge top-center moyo.  Eventually, he should peep at E15.  He might kill your group, and even if he doesn't he'll have an easy game with a large territorial advantage.]

(;W[ek]C[RickMott: Right idea, wrong side.  Your upper group is much more important, so you want to connect to it or threaten black's 12th line stones if you can.  See variation.]
;B[ei];W[fk];B[fl]C[RickMott: so now your two weak groups are bigger, and black's attacking stones are stronger.  If I were black, I would peep at E15 now and try to kill you group.]
;W[hk]C[now white's running instead of black];B[gl];W[po]C[RickMott: much more urgent to try to help your upper weak group.  If black ever finds E15, you would almost have to resign.  You have no eyes, and you're almost enclosed.]
;B[mq]C[RickMott: He answers locally, so you get a reprive -- for now.]
;W[ql]C[RickMott: This is a small, gote single-purpose move: to make a litle territory on the right.  Black has many good options now.  He can try E15: he can play a capping move at P8 to attempt a huge moyo; he can jump down to G4 to strengthen his 8th line stones and make territory on the bottom.]
;B[qn]C[good move from black, whats the best respons ?

RickMott: Actually, not that good, because he answered locally instead of building his moyo while attacking one of your weak groups.

Not even that good locally.  You can separate black with R4 or R5 and fight.  However, the sequence you followed was good for making strength on the right side so your weak groups have somewhere to run, even though you gave black a bigger corner than he deserved.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qm];B[qp];W[pi]C[RickMott: This is OK, but I think a knight's move at P9 might be a little better.  It indirectly protects the cut at Q7, makes a bigger moyo (black can't really invade your right side and live), and extends closer to your running weak group.]
;B[pk]C[another move that kept me busy but here it didnt end so well

RickMott: This is an overplay by black; he shouldn't be able to do this.]

(;W[qk]C[RickMott: I wouldn't worry about his descending into your territory; he won't be able to make eyes.  How about P8?  It protects the cut (see variation) and makes it harder for black to run out.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pl]C[I thought I could encolse balck but it didnt work out]
;W[ok]C[RickMott: If you couldn't read this out all the way, it would probably be safer to take the liberty at Q10 instead.  Black is still in trouble, and you make the right side secure.  You would have to watch your liberties and cutting points for the lower-right stones, but this sequence should come out all right for you.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[qj];W[rj];B[qi];W[ol];B[ri]
(;W[sj]C[RickMott: oops.  You create a weakness at S9 and don't take away any black liberties.  If you connect solidly at S9, you're still ahead 4 liberties to 3 and you have the hane at S6 to make an eye.

I ran out one variation in which you win; don't know if all the variations work...]
;B[ph];W[oi];B[rm];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[rk]C[RickMott: ouch.  This is a big loss.]
;W[no]C[RickMott: These two stones are not your biggest problem.  H10 or H11 would strengthen your running group and possible center moyo.  Black still has a good attack on your upper group with E15.  Protecting one of your bigger weak groups is much more important that O5.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij];W[gh];B[fg];W[ii];B[ee]C[lots of waisted moves here..

RickMott: No, really only off by one move.  If you'd done F15, Q10 or Q11 instead of O5, black would be one move behind and would have to worry about protecting his F12 group instead of being able to attack you with sente.]
;W[eg]C[RickMott: This is bad, though.  You force black to connect without doing anything useful for yourself.]
;B[ef]C[RickMott: this is a mistake.  Black should connect at F12.]
;W[fh];B[dg];W[cg]C[RickMott: you're just strengthening black.  You have no chance of making two eyes here.]
;B[bh];W[ad];B[ab];W[be];B[de];W[gf]C[RickMott: good, you abandoned the upper left with sente.  However, the cutting stone at H9 is extremely important; you need to strengthen it somehow.  See variation for what happens if you don't.

Compare that with playing white J8, or even just J9 atari and push to K9.  You must fight in the center now to have any chance.]

(;B[gg];W[hg];B[ed]C[RickMott: black doesn't have to do this.  He should cut at H14 right away.]
;W[ff];B[eg];W[hf]C[RIckMott: you got a lucky break here.  If black doesn't figure out the center fight, you may have a chance.]
;B[fq]C[RickMott: and he doesn't.  Now it is absolutely crucial for you to fight in the center...]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[eo];B[dq]C[RickMott: small moves on both sides.  A lot depends on who sees the importance of the center cutting stones first.]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp]C[RickMott: Black comes out of this with sente.  What will he do???]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[jj]C[RickMott: ouch.  What a difference if you had played in this area first!]
;W[ji];B[il]C[RickMott: Ok, the game is pretty much over now.  I don't see how you can catch up in territory.  Black should play to simplify the positions at this point.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[ip]C[RickMott: This is OK for preventing black from making still more territory on the bottom, but to have any chance you have to try something dramatic.

I see only one possibility on the board, and it looks very difficult.  You would have to attack black's upper right group, and arrange the attack so that your two dead stones can fill black's eye space with a dead shape.

You would have to start with a pincer at K17, and hope black misses the threat and makes a reflex pincer from his strong position on the left.  You shouldn't get away with it, but it's the only hope.  Black can probably make it seki, anyway, which isn't good enough for you.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[jo];B[in];W[go];B[hr];W[lp]
C[RickMott: This sequence is just solidifying black's territory on the bottom without making any for you.]
;B[ar];W[aq]C[another useless move...

RickMott: Not completely -- it's one point in gote. :)];B[dn]
;W[bm];B[bl]C[missed D5

RickMott: you can't connect at D5 because black can force a ko for the life of the group  if you do.  See variation.]

(;W[ao]C[RickMott: this is painful; you are forced to give up 5 stones to save the rest from ko.]
;B[do];W[hm]C[RickMott: dangerous!  You risk losng the corner too if black ends in sente and pushes at C5.]
;B[im];W[hl];B[ik]C[RickMott: Black wins this way too, but it would be safer for him to cut at H6.  Your three stones can never get more than 2 liberties that way.]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[fn];B[hn];W[hc]C[RickMott: Right idea, wrong side.  You should try K17 and hope for an oversight by Black.

But if black sees C5, he can kill the entire lower left corner, and then it may not matter if you can capture the upper right or not.]
;B[ne]C[RickMott: no, he answers locally.  You have a chance, even if a very thin one.]
;W[lq]C[RickMott: Oh, no.  Completely unimportant compared to either continuing the attempt at the top or saving the lower left.]
;B[mp]C[RickMott: but again, he's being very kind and answering locally.]
;W[mo];B[mr];W[lj]C[RickMott: your best chance would be L18, threatening to connect to the two stones, and follow up with M15 to keep him from making an eye outside.  But it's dicey.

This move doesn't do much for you.];B[ki];W[kj];B[kh];W[kf]
C[RickMott: black may give you a chance at this yet!];B[mh]
;W[nf]C[RickMott: I think you want to separate with N14 instead.  This lets black make trouble with the cut at P14, maybe.]
;B[mf];W[me]C[RickMott: this doesn't work.  Black has double atari at P14, and even if he didn't he could capture your cutting stone with M15-N17.

That's why a whte play at N14 would be better before.  It still separates black, but there are fewer cutting points and ataris to worry about.]
;B[ng];W[of];B[og];W[re];B[le]C[RickMott: very bad sequence for you.  Now black has a chance of killing your top group if you're not very careful, and if that doesn't work he is bound to get sente for C5, killing the lower left.]
;W[lf];B[md];W[lg]C[RickMott: bad shape, and very dangerous.  You need eyes for your group!  K17 would help.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[li];W[mi]C[RickMott: Looks nice, but shortage of liberties will bite you.]
;B[mj];W[ni];B[lk];W[kk]C[well more mistakes and mistakes

RickMott: This is sente, and you can make an eye for the upper center in sente with atari at K12.
Then a second eye with K17 for sure.];B[kl];W[ll]C[RickMott: Ouch! you really need the sente eye at K12.]
;B[jk];W[ml];B[jf]C[RickMott: Black should attack from the top at L15 instead, I think.]
;W[ke];B[je]C[RickMott: black should connect back at K13; that would kill the eye at H12.]
;W[kd];B[jd]C[RickMott: trying to kill everything.];W[kc];B[lb]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[hd]C[RickMott: now I don't see how white can live.  Black can connect two ways.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[ld];B[me];W[fb]C[RickMott: wrong side.  You can descend at L18 in sente and try to kill black on the top right.]
;B[eb];W[hb]C[RickMott: this doesn't even make an eye.  Locally, you must play G19, but you really have to try L18 first.]
;B[kb]C[RickMott: no chance now.  Black is alive.];W[jb];B[mb]
C[Game full of mistakes, like everything i did turned out wrong.. Black wasnt really 18k but still. Im sure that there will be many moves to improve here, as I cvould see afterwards.
