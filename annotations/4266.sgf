C[Reviewer:

Thanks for looking at this game! I played black and lost by 31.5 points. I have scattered a couple of questions / comments throughout.

-Philip

Hi,

My name is Peter.
This was an interesting game.
I played it thru 2 times.
And I hope some of my hints are useful.
Any question is welcome.

I prefix my commts with g4:

go4fun];B[pp];W[dq];B[qd];W[dc];B[oc];W[de];B[do];W[fq];B[ck]
C[I'm not sure about joseki here.. but I didn't want to immediately jump into the corner and allow my opponent a long pincer / extension.

g4: This move is also good. But I would prefer to jump into the corner to stabilize the group. The entension from the low white stones is not so valuable.]
;W[ch];B[jd]LB[hc:A]C[I knew this move would provoke a response at A, but I figured this would allow me to take another big point at R10.

g4: good thinking];W[hc];B[qj]C[Since the D3 and F3 stones are low, I figured an approach to the Q4 stone would not be very appealing to white.

g4: Maybe, but with white strength the lonely 2 black stones look weak.]
;W[np]C[So white approaches high.];B[nq]C[Is simply playing Q6 better here?

g4: This is a matter of taste I think. It is only important to get sente to add a stone on the left side]
;W[mq];B[oq];W[mp];B[pn]C[g4: looks very big for black!];W[fo]
C[g4: I would have played B4 to take black's base away.];B[cq]
C[g4: At last this stabilizes the black group.];W[cr];B[cp]
;W[oo]C[g4: Usually white extends to B2 to reduce black's eye space.]
;B[po];W[nm]C[g4: Better played without the previous exchange.]

(;B[fn]C[g4: This is the first move which seems too generous.
Black is going to solidify the white moyo. Try to imagine the next moves and the resulting position. White will get a 50 point area and black will get a 30 point area which can be undermined.
See the variation for a reduction instead.
And bear in mind, that a move at B2 is very big for both sides.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[gn];B[gm];W[hm];B[he]C[I wanted to get this move in before responding below.

g4: This is understandable but go is a game where you cannot get everything. You should be prepared if white doesn't answer but plays E6 instead.
But in itsself this move is good expanding your moyo while reducing white's.
You should also be aware of a white move at P15 or O16 which aim at reducing the moyo.]
;W[gd]C[g4: But luckily white answers (while securing territory). Now a black move around M12 seems big.]
;B[eq]C[g4: should end in gote and is far too small at this moment.]
;W[er];B[ep];W[fp];B[dp]C[I think this exchange was bad for black, but luckily my opponent connects here.]
;W[dr]C[g4: Yes this was lucky. But on the other hand the black group became weak. The 6 stones have only 3 liberties and there are severe cutting points at D6 and F7 and the move at B2 is no longer sente.]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[hk]C[g4: Simpler and safer at G9. This hane creates a 3 cutting point. Did you read this?]
;W[gk]C[Overplay?

g4: I don't think so. There are cutting points at D6 and G7 and the black groups don't have much liberties.]
;B[ik]C[g4: Very ambitious. I think white can attack the black right group now solidifying his lonely cutting point. Then he should be able to attack the 2 stones and destroy all the black moyo.
Black can attack now at once. Did you read it out?];W[in]C[g4: White plays very solid]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[fi]C[g4: The black cutting stones are getting weaker with every move.]
;W[gh];B[ih]
(;W[fh]C[g4: I this move is too slow. I think white has to exploit the black weakness at once before it is too late. See Variation]
;B[nk]C[At this point I think I have the lead in the game.

g4: Do you think? Did you count?
Well let's count roughly:
White UL: 35 ,Bot: 30 totals with komi to 70 points.
Black LR: 20, UR: 12, Left: 10 totals to sure  42 points.

So you have to make 30 points more with your moyo as your opponent when he attacks your center stones. By playing conservately this should be possible.
But it is not easy, as black is open at the top and the centerstones are weak.]
;W[jj];B[ki]C[g4: Right idea!];W[kj];B[ll]C[g4: Can be cut. Better at M9.]
;W[ji];B[ln];W[ko];B[lo];W[lp];B[lj];W[kk];B[lk];W[kh];B[li]
;W[jh];B[nr]C[g4: Small the monkey jump is worth 8 points. A move around M14 secure a lot more. Or perhaps at K18 to secure the top.]
;W[mr]C[g4: Ok if white answers this is a success.];B[ms]C[g4: Very slow.]
;W[lc]C[Perhaps my move at N1 came too early.

g4: This is a good move of white. He tries to cut off the 2 stones which would be enough to win.]
;B[jb]C[g4: Not possible. M15 seems to kill all the stones.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[ke]
(;W[md]C[g4: Unnecessary. A move at M13 is sufficient.];B[lg]
C[g4: good!];W[lh];B[mh]C[I decide to block aggresively here. Perhaps this is an overplay.

g4: I do not quite understand this move.  If you want to cut off the whole territory on the right side it is cleary on overplay. White can get good eyeshape for his group and as a result the black top center stones will die.]
;W[mg];B[kg];W[ng];B[ne]
(;W[nd]C[g4: I would prefer O17. Attaching makes you stronger. See variations.]
;B[oe];W[me]C[g4: Useless. N14 is only a false eye.];B[oh]C[g4: I don't think white can make eyes here. I would prefer O17.]
;W[kd];B[hd]C[g4: Good answer.];W[hb]C[g4: Hard];B[mb];W[kb]
C[g4: Useless];B[ka];W[la];B[ja];W[lb];B[mc];W[od]
(;B[pc]C[I don't think I have a choice here.

g4: You have. See var.];W[pe];B[of]C[g4: This is only one big eye. You can still try to kill with O14.]
;W[og];B[pf];W[ph];B[nh];W[qf]
(;B[pd]C[g4: Not bad. But S15 seems to kill all white stones. See var.]
;W[qe];B[ma];W[nf];B[nc]C[g4: gote. Just taking the 6 stones is sufficient.]
;W[pg];B[ld]C[White lives in sente. I think the game is difficult for me at this point.

g4: You have to count after the next white move.];W[pi]C[g4: So...
White
Upper left still 35, bottom 20, center 10, right 5 = 70
Black
Upper right 20, left 20, lower right 25 = 65 points. 

With a move at Q9 you keep the balance. But it is endgame now, and you should play sente moves first.]
;B[pj]C[g4: Good!];W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[nn]C[g4: Small now. First O11, threatens P11. If white answers, playing there is good. But there are also other big moves. L1 or B11 or G15.]
;W[on];B[om];W[mn];B[nl]C[g4: This pattern is well known. In this situation it is best to play O7. White has no alternative to take at O5. Then you can play at N7 if you want.]
;W[mm];B[ks]TR[mh][nh][oh]C[I think the jump to L1 is significantly bigger than saving the marked stones.

g4: Yes, and it is sente.];W[jr];B[js];W[ir];B[jm]C[g4: Why not J1 and L2?]
;W[kn];B[km]C[g4: First M7 taking the 2 stones is possible.]
;W[il];B[lm];W[ig]C[g4: Small. B10, B2 S11 S16 are bigger.]
;B[mo];W[no];B[kp];W[kq];B[jn]C[g4: Unnecessary. K5 is ok.]
;W[jp];B[jl];W[jk];B[go]C[g4: Great!];W[hn];B[io]C[g4: Nice.]

(;W[ho]C[g4: This must lead into disaster. White has to play at J10. See var.]
