C[Hi,
  
   I will try to give comments as good as I can, and I hope they will answer your question.

>I wanted to develop really fast and aim for a right side moyo

>Was it ok?

Well, high pincers are quite difficult moves, I can't say it is a mistake, but maybe a more natural & balanced sequence like following would be ok : black P17, white J16, black M3, white j3, then black can take san-san at C17 (see variation)]
;W[gc];B[me]C[I think this move is much too soft, I would play black p17 or play on bottom. White can take san-san (see variation), black will get a wall, but I think the situation is ok as black will have to play to protect right side. Bottom is getting very big]

(;W[lp]C[Bottom is good too, but I would play M4 at L4, M4 is too far]
;B[nq]C[good];W[iq]C[black can be happy];B[nj]C[good, but you have to know that your right side cannot be considered as territory yet. R7 would be a bit more protective]
;W[md]C[not a good move, this is very heavy];B[ne]C[difficult to say here... this is not bad for black. I would consider maybe play black p17]
;W[jb]C[this is one way to fight, I would be white, I would take san-san (that would have been better than n16 too)]
;B[le]C[heavy and slow];W[kc]C[same];B[kr]C[there are bigger points than play on second line. black can invade san san on top left, protect on bottom right at R7 (maybe a bit slow and passive), ...]

no, black played clearly better than white, white has been very passive and in this situation allows black to have a huge moyo on right, and start to secure the center]
;W[qe]C[white attacked, however even white finds a way to live, it will be small and making black very strong either toward center or secure bottom right moyo]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rc]C[don't invite white to invade your moyo...]

Well, white lived because of black mistakes, however white lives small and black is still winning easily if be careful not to make more mistake letting white destroy the bottom right]
;B[hc]C[>My aim is to cut. If i can cut his stones into 2 groups I think I >have the possibility to kill his top right group.

No, don't try to kill the top, you could invade san-san, taking the corner and making white build a wall toward your wall... means white gets nothing or almost and you get his corner]
;W[hb]C[>He is playing safer than I expected];B[gd];W[fc];B[fd]
;W[ed]TR[eg]C[>My first idea was to play something like e13 to enclose territory >but I thought he had possibilities to reduce a lot of it by the >bottom.
h17 was a bad idea... taking the corner would have been better, now white has the corner.]
;B[hr]C[>So I attack his bottom group.
Bad move... can't live unless white does mistake (see variation after move 95)]

You can be happy white replied so bad to your move, but black play was not good in the first place. Anyway, it is clear black is stronger than white]

Well, you clearly played better than white, you did mistakes, and white more, white didn't take opportunity where he could. I hope the earlier comments help you to understand better. The game looks pretty finished to me at this point. End of comments.]
