C[smlak: This is the first game i played after reading a bit of the book called The Endgame and i really put though in this time, i though what kind of moves would the author of the book make. And it turned out pretty well i guess. I have played a little less than a month and my opponent said he had played 3 years, but i don't think that's possible.
Thanks in advance.


io: Hello! Though this review is for smlak playing white I will comment some black moves aswell.]

(;B[pf]SQ[pg]C[io: The black Q14 stone is too close to Q16. It would do a better job at Q13...]
;W[jd];B[cq];W[cp]TR[dm]C[io: Now the white stones are even more crowded. Imagine the D6 stone at D7.  That would work much better.
Even though the white move is not good I can't tell a better move in this situation. Probably the best you could do is playing C3 before black does!]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[io: Now black has got the corner secure leaving your stones totally overconcentrated.
C3 really was the key-point, watch out for those.];B[fo];W[eq]
C[io: Do you see why black NEEDS TO answer this move?

If you get to play E2 aswell there's a good chance the corner will be killed.
On the other hand that makes it a good ko-thread that you might keep for later.]
;B[er];W[fm];B[jp]
(;W[ho]C[io: With this move you kindly secure blacks territory. H5 is not even connected to the F7 stone.

The room to make territory is not in the middle of the board but in the corners and at the edges.]
;B[hp];W[hm];B[pb]C[io: Black found the second big move here.]

(;W[pm]C[io: This is probably the last chance to invade here! But still...]

(;W[qm];B[ol];W[rq];B[qq];W[rr];B[qr];W[qp];B[de]C[io: Invasions should not be played so close to opposing stones.
Now the white attack at D12 would nicely put up a framework while attacking the black intruder. :)]

(;W[df]C[io: This move whereas is too close. 

Directly attaching to a stone usually strengthens - both of the attached stones though!
White already is strong in this position. The lone black stone is very weak. And your opponent should be very happy about being strengthened.]

In this case it certainly is!];W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[dl]C[io: This is a shape you should remember. D8 works very well with the C11 and E11 stones.]
;W[bl]C[io: Again B8 and D6 are not connected.];B[cm]C[io: And black doesn't wait to proof it.]
;W[dj]C[io: And once again... well...];B[ej];W[cj];B[bj];W[ck]
C[io: The empty triangle is bad shape, but in this case probably the best you can do.]
;B[bm];W[di];B[ch];W[ek]
(;B[fj];W[fk];B[gj];W[dk]C[io: Well done! If black had got the chance to cut here the white stones would have been sealed in and gone.]

(;W[ai]C[io: OK!
If you can keep the black stones sealed in this move kills.
But now black has to try everything to get out. The variation on move 94 shows how.]

io: Well... what about endgame now???
But: this is a really good move!

Some general advices:
 -> Try to keep your stones connected. At least you need to know, when your stones are not tightly connected because you will need a loophole then.

 -> Learn about "good" and "bad" shape. 
A move that makes good shape, often is the right move. It doesn't spare you from reading out the sequence, but you can first read a move that has a good chance to be the best.
Avoid bad shape unless you can't circumvent it after reading carefully.
It's also a good idae to take into concideration a move that prevents your opponent from making good shape (or force him to make a move that's bad shape).

 -> Take at least 30 minutes of time for each side.

 -> Look through reviews of games played by other players of your own strength.

 -> Have fun playing go! :)])

(;W[dm]CR[di]TR[dh][dl]C[io: You could play at least one more space away from your D4 stone.

The rule of thumb says: one stone - jump two, two stones - jump three, and so on... 
If there are no opposing stones around your stones usually are connected.

So in this situation the two-point-jump D4-D7 is good. It is also closer to the two white stones in the upper left corner. From those two stones (counting as a wall of three stones) the extension to D11 would be ideal.]
;B[dr];W[cq]C[io: This move keeps black from taking the corner and is the usual continuation.]
