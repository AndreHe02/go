C[I tried several different moves, but the only way I could win is by making the computer make bad moves.  (Not that I knew they were bad until I made them for it.)  So, please comment on the earlier part of the game too, even though I only showed my thoughts on my blunder.  Before that, I don't know where I went wrong.

Max: I will do my best. 9x9 is a different sort of game and I'm still weak on its fuseki. But I think I found a few key areas for improvement. I also showed how black could have been even harder on you in a couple places. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.];B[cd];W[gf]TR[gc]

;W[fc];B[eg];W[ee]LB[dc:A][gh:B]C[Corner gold, side silver, center grass. I think A or B would be better.]
