(;B[ec]
(;W[pk]C[What is the best move to attack Black ??

I would hold back one space, since black would still play from above (playing R8 feels way too tight), the way you play in the game, you give B various tactics for crossing under.]
;B[pi];W[nk];B[nn]C[this jump feels too slow and heavy];W[ni]
;B[ci];W[cd]LB[cc:A][de:B]C[This moves turns out to be bad. What are the alternatives ?? A, B or somewhere else ??

I don't think it turns out bad, but A is the common move when he has a stone around C11.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[dc];B[dd];W[cb];B[db];W[cc];B[kn]LB[jq:A]
C[Better on A ?

no, there is a fight in the center, he should strengthen his group first.]
;W[fq]C[this looks a bit hurried, I think you want too much here. J6 building strength while attacking B is another option that I like better, and if you want to stretch all the way over to the corner I think you should play the high approach to build influence. Making the lower side territory should not be a priority for W.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[cn]
(;W[jp];B[rk]C[playing on the second line like this is not good, it also helps the weak W group get strong. He should directly invade at M3 and see what W responds.]
;W[qj]LB[mn:B][mo:A]C[I think white should have played first at A, Black B, then at 40.

Maybe, but the S9 R10 exchange is already a big minus for B.]

;B[lo];W[lr];B[hp]C[Somewhere during this fight white lost track and come out poorly. Where did it go wrong for white?

I don't know - did it really go wrong for W? If anything was wrong I think it was the F3 move.]

(;B[ke]C[This is, I think, not good for black, what is a better alterantive ??]
;W[kd];B[me]C[B must be trying to attack the W stones below, but it's a terrible strategy.]
;W[of];B[kh];W[hc]C[now W takes territory and B has made a heavy group.]
;B[fn]
(;W[jm];B[ai]LB[hm:A]C[Too slow ?? Better at A ??

this is a huge move, but maybe he should play A first and then after you answer take the stone. In fact your K7 move is a little slow (playing from strong stones is not so efficient).]
;W[ql]
(;B[rm]C[this is a huge mistake. B's eyeshape disappears.];W[rl]
;B[sl];W[rh];B[ro];W[rp];B[jn];W[hm]C[this exchange of K6 H7 hurts B very much to play. B is now losing the game.]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[ml]LB[gk:A]C[Better at A ? But can white kill black ??

if not killing the stones below, then W will kill the stones above. B should not play G8 at all, but defend his group directly.]
;W[gk]TR[kj][lj][kk]C[this is slow. you should M10 or L9 or L10 to split the two B groups and keep up the attack. Each move has their pros and cons, but I think I like L9 the most.]
;B[fk]TR[lj]C[B absolutely has no time to play here. This move must be at M10]
;W[lk];B[km];W[gj]C[this is not the urgent place. you should play K8]
