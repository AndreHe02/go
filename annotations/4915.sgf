C[Harleqin: I added some questions and remarks marked with -H-. Also some variations from our postmortem are shown.

Fprfun (hereafter "ff") - This was an interesting game.  Thanks to both players for providing good materials for study.  I think that Black showed good overall understanding of the flow during the game while White was a little sharper in tactics.  Black should work on fighting power (tesuji problems and life and death problems would be good exercises).  It can be very depressing to gain the upper hand across the board and then throw it away by missing the best local play - I know that personally from bitter experience :-)

I have commented on various possibilities.  I have also left in quite a few uncommented variations as well.  These are just rambling thoughts about some additional possibilities.  Naturally no reader should take my variations as "correct" or "the best".  They are just alternatives.  Feel free to tear them apart and find the flaws within.  Enjoy :-)]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[fc]
(;W[hc]C[ff - When the lower right is Black, this H17 is a common way to avoid the mini-chinese fuseki.  However, here it is not so obvious why White does not simply answer at C14.  See the variation...]
;B[oc]
(;W[fd]C[ff - White does not normally follow up with this immediately because typically the right side is Black and White rushes to split the side.]
;B[qj]
(;W[ec]C[-H-: I believe this is too slow.

ff - As indicated, I think the issue really starts earlier than this.  However, I think you are right about this play.  I think White would be better off to approach the bottom left at C6.]
;B[cj];W[fq];B[dn];W[jp]C[ff - This leaves behind the invasion point at H3.  Since White has to expect Black to play R6 soon.  The bottom is difficult to enclose in a reasonable way.  I think that J4 would be more interesting here.]
;B[qn];W[nq]C[ff - This play is too passive when Black has made a 3-space extention.  White has to be looking at the invasion at R8.  O4 is necessary here.]

(;B[jc]C[-H-: I also thought about C14. Which is better? Or should I keep back at C13?

ff - K17 looks more natural to me.  Black uses the aji of F17 directly and expanding the right side framework looks more natural.  See the variations...]

(;W[oe]C[ff - To my eye this is a strange choice by White.  The position is not balanced here.  See the variations...]
;B[pf];W[nc];B[nd]
(;W[od]
(;B[pc]C[ff - This is questionable, but White helps Black make the best out of it in the game.  See the variation...]

(;W[of]C[White should play to take advantage of Black's previous play.  See the variation...]
;B[mc]C[-H-: I thought that if I answer at Q13 White can fight with N17.

ff - With the stone on K17, this could probably be at N16, but I agree that Black needs to do something here.]

(;W[qe]C[ff - This White play and Black's reply were probably played because this situation looks familar from joseki books.  However, both plays are poor :-)  White tries too hard here and Black cooperates rather than punishing White.]

(;B[qf]C[ff - Here Black misses a big opportunity.  This play is reasonable only if Black can connect at S15.  Black correctly realizes that this is not possible on the next play.  However, if the connection is not possible...]

(;W[pe];B[rd]C[-H-: If I block, I don't have an answer to w O18.]

(;W[oh]
(;B[pi];W[ch]C[Zwarn [2d\]: ich denke das war gut für mich
Harleqin [1d\]: ich halte die truppe rechts eigentlich für zu schwach

-H-: Is it OK for White to tenuki? I thought that the group on the right was too weak.

ff - Fundamentally it does not look reasonable to tenuki here.  White's stones do not yet have even one eye.  This would not be such a problem if White was strong everywhere else, but this is not the case.  Black can think about invading in a number of places such as H3, C14/C17, M3, R3, etc.  That means that Black does not have to capture the upper right White stones.  All that is necessary is to chase them and build strength to support later invasions.]

(;B[ng]C[-H-: Attacking directly was a bit clumsy, I guess. This peep seems bad, because White can R12 afterwards.

ff - As we will see later, White has no good play on the side, whether R12 or something else.  So this peep is not bad from that point of view.]

(;W[og]
(;B[nj]
(;W[qh]C[ff - White has no time for this because it does not threaten to make two eyes.  Locally this is not the correct way to play.  See the variations...]

(;B[re]C[ff - Better to surround White from the outside.  Locally S14 is better here.  See the variations...]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[mg]C[-H-: Could Black play M13 here (see variation)?]

(;B[mi];W[lg];B[ph]C[-H-: I have to play here, otherwise White can R13.

ff - R13 is small.  It threatens nothing in particular and makes no eyes.  Black gains about 10 points in gote here?]
;W[cq]C[ff - Compared to Q12 this is a huge play.];B[dq];W[dr]
;B[cp];W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[ig]C[-H-: I thought I could gain something here, but it turned out clumsy again. Should I invade the lower side directly instead?

ff - Black recognizes that the White stones are not settled yet and tries to exploit thata.  This is good.  The later play may let White off too easily but the underlying strategic idea is correct.

If Black invades the bottom immediately, it is not reasonable to think that Black can end in sente.  Therefore a Black invasion expects to let White have sente to play in the sente.  There is the Go proverb, "Urgent plays before big plays".  This looks like such a case.  Do not let White off easily.

In addition, here White can not fix all the defects in the bottom with a single play so Black need not worry about missing the chance to invade.]
;W[jd]C[-H-: Is it possible for Black to get a better result with a move like L15 or L14?]

(;B[oi];W[rh];B[rg];W[lh];B[lj];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj]
(;B[lf]C[ff - Fundamentally this is a very cautious play.  Black saves some stones that have not yet been cut off.]
;W[jh]C[ff - As a result of Black's last play, White virtually assures life here, in sente .]
;B[hf]C[ff - This is very painful];W[jk];B[lq];W[lp]
(;B[kq]C[-H-: L4 seems much better.];W[kp];B[mq];W[np];B[iq]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gp];B[gr];W[cl]C[Zwarn [2d\]: ja aber reichen heisst vielleicht komi abstand
Zwarn [2d\]: fehler darfst du dir nicht so viele erlauben]
(;B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[bj]
(;B[bi]C[-H-: Is this OK for Black, or should I have tried D9 instead of D8?

ff - This play is not good, it just helps White.  You should simply connect at D10 here.  It looks difficult to play D9 instead of D8.  White  is strong on the bottom and there is a possibility that White will cut Black in half and capture the bottom left.]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[bk];B[cm];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo];B[pn];W[dg]C[-H-: G17 might be the biggest point now.

ff - It is not clear that this prevents a Black invasion at 3-3.  However, the analysis of all the possibilities is outside the scope of this analysis :-)]

(;B[bp]C[ff - This should certainly be at F2.  See the variation...]
;W[fr];B[nr];W[or];B[mr];W[sn];B[os];W[pr]
(;B[gc]C[ff - Since Black is not willing to exchange the upper middle, is this better at H18?  This play looks heavy]
