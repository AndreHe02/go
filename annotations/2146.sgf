AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[pq]C[While this variation is unusual, you should not be worried. Usually, the objective for white is just to disrupt black. Black on the other hand should use this opportunity to enclose white and build thickness towards the centre. See the variation.]
;B[qp];W[qq]
(;B[fq]C[You should not tenuki here but rather keep the pressure on white. See the variation. The strength built up in the variation is the kind of stregth that wins handicap games.]
;W[op]C[This is the key point. "Your opponents key point is your key point"]
;B[pn];W[oo];B[on]C[Q5 would be bad shape. This is fine.];W[rp]
;B[qo];W[jq];B[pj]C[You allow white the initative a lot.];W[ro]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[qn];W[ol]C[Jump out is better as you suggest.]

(;B[pm];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk];B[rl];W[pk];B[mn]C[This is a good move. S9 is small. Plays of the second line are rarely good.]
;W[lp];B[ll];W[qj];B[fc]C[I don't really like this move. It seems away from the action and a bit small. Usually these types of moves are not ideal for the handicap game.]
;W[qf];B[ph];W[rh];B[nc];W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[Again this is too small. You are following white and thinking on too small a scale. Playing at the centre top of centre right would be better. Look at the two moves. Do they not look nicer to you. Who cares if white takes a corner, we will have the rest of the board.]
;W[of];B[lo]C[This move seems to have been played with nice timing.]
;W[mp];B[dj]C[Very nice move.];W[bp]C[This kind of move is interesting. It threatens to move into the corner or to make a base on the side. It is difficult to answer. Typical strong white move. You can try putting him under direct pressure. See variation.]

(;B[cn];W[dq];B[eq];W[cq];B[eo];W[bn];B[bm];W[co];B[dn];W[ao]

(;B[cm]C[No necessary or at least not very big. Probably reinfoce at the top or in the centre if you are worried about the cut]
;W[bd];B[cf]C[Probably should play more aggessively. This is your opportunity to really fight.]

(;B[bj]C[Too small, I think. See variation];W[lc]C[With this move, I think the game is now lost. Have a look at the variation]

C[I haven't recorded all the end of the game. From this point, it is mostly end game. As usual, the point is not to follow too much. Basically white is already ahead at this time. 
SUMMARY: White played some tricky moves. This made the game difficult and you ended up being a bit too defensive. Keep your eye on the big points.]

(;B[jd];W[bj];B[bk];W[ai]C[Black about 50 points
White about 40 points

You are still ahead although only by about one handicap stone. However, it is still your move and you can probably make more a little more territory by a move a J4 or maybe K5 or L4?]
