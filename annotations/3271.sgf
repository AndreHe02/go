C[hi, thanks for reviewing
this is a game i lost by 0,5 moku
if something special or mistakes jump into your eye, plz mention it :)

jantiff: Hello. My comments are prefixed with "--". I use triangle marking to mean "weak", square to mean "strong". You'll find a summary on last move.]

  * the white stone is high, it can run easily.
  * the marked white stone is limiting Black's prospects on the side.]

Overall: you anwser your opponent too easily ! Take sente, look for ways to seize the initiative: building moyo, attacking weak groups. Please think of this in your next games.

Strategy:  when attacking, always go for a definite gain, be it cash or power.

  * seek balance (P5)
  * don't go for the kill unless you read it 100% ! (P15 etc.)
  * avoid vague moves, give your moves at least one clear purpose or follow-up

Tactics: pay attention to shape !

  * avoid playing into hane at the head (B16)
  * avoid giving ponnuki
  * 1st line moves lose liberties (T10, H19)])
