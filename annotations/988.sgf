AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello,

this is my game against a 12k-opponent on KGS. I have won with 1.5 pts difference, and I feel this game represents my current playing level - both good and weak sides - best of all the games I've played lately. I would appreciate any comments, especially those concerning my fuseki; I have very little ideas as to where to play next in order to balance territory/influence in the opening.

Thanks for your time and hope you won't find this game boring.

Greetings,
Zoran Rilak];W[np]C[Angalot [18k\]: hi pakira];B[pn]C[Hi Zoran!   heez, Most of my go is self learn and I've never review other people games b4 so if there's any problem, forgive me ; p


Your 1st move is fine.];W[pl]C[unreasonable, W cannot get gd result here due to presence of Q10 stone.

The W stones are too separated];B[ql]C[P8 also possible];W[qm]

;B[jd]TR[pj][qj]C[tenuki seemed reasonable here, I thought White couldn't gain much by attacking the two marked stones.
____________________________________________

seems so on the surface, but Q12 is a vital spot for W attack on your Q10 group. W has a weak Q8 group. If u strengthen ur Q 10 group at P12, u have a solid shape (gd shape = influence) and can later aim to  make profit while attack the weak W group.

Nevertheless, K16 is still an ok move for fuseki];W[cc]C[Questionable move(dumb move!?)

With D10 and K16 stones around, an invasion at C17, lead to a solid wall of B. ( Immense influence of B)]

(;B[gb]LB[gc:A]C[I actually wanted to play at A here; why I played G18 I still don't know.

____________________________________________

U're right at playing at A. this will give u ample thickness and make all your neighbouring stones work efficiently.

I guess u're afraid dat W will gain if u play at A thus u want to stop him from advancing. dat's very wrong.   In go, U got to make as little leak hole as possible in the beginning. leak holes such as cuts and inefficient shapes. When W cuts at A u'll lose even more.

besides, there is a go proverb dat says: the 2nd line is the line of defeat and 3rd line is the line of victory. If u play at 'A' and continues to, u are on ur way to victory.

Btw, (I think), A is joseki];W[bd];B[be];W[bb];B[ad];W[bc];B[db]
;W[da];B[fa];W[cb];B[cf];W[ac]C[unnecessary move

W lives w/o A17];B[ae]C[no need to prevent the atari. u can block at A14 after W takes the stone

G17 is urgent. play it 1st to prevent the severe cut

Trying to live so deep is of course impossible. U shld try doing dat at places where ur stones are reachable like O3 (maybe?)

I think it's perfectly fine the Ko is worth is abt 16 pts

basically, i can see u are still not very confident at killing opponent's stones. Beside dat, i think u are pretty fine. practise more on tsumego!
