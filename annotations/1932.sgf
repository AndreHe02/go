C[Hello, mertgs!

My name is lect, I've been playing go for about 3 months now and I'm an 11k on KGS.

Whenever I make a comment it will be denoted with a >>];B[pq]
C[mertgs [23k?\]: hi

---------------------

To the reviewer: Thank you for taking time to review my game. In this game I am playing as black.]
;W[cq];B[dc]C[halo5 [28k?\]: hello];W[pd];B[nc];W[oc]C[>>Usually when white connects to your stone like such, you extend down instead of jumping away. See the variations.]

(;B[ld];W[hd];B[gd]C[It seems like I probably should have played somewhere near C14. What to do?

>>Attaching is definitely what you DON'T want to do in this situation. Attaching usually forces the opponent to strengthen his stone. In this case, he will probably extend towards the center and try to find life. Forcing him to strengthen his lonesome stone will place your M16 group in danger.]
;W[id];B[qf]C[>> Ok. You apply the proverb "the opponent's key point is also my key point." Now W's Q16 group is in danger.

But although R14 is an urgent move, there are some much more urgent moves on the board. You generally want to settle your groups first before initiating an attack on white's groups.]

mertgs [23k?\]: mishit
mertgs [23k?\]: it' ok];W[pg]C[halo5 [28k?\]: you'll work me without undo, trust me

---------------------------

I haven't won any of the 50 I've played (I've been playing for about 2 months now). I thought that white would probably take me in this game because it was even and he is 23k approximately.]
;B[pi]C[mertgs [23k?\]: ok no prob

(;B[rd]TR[mc]C[Is this typically too agressive? Should I typically even try these past several moves?

>>If W plays here, then it will put your marked stone in great danger. Seal off the leaks in your group before you start extending for territory. Also, S16 is not very big, nor is it very urgent. You'd be better off extending at N17.

>>Your last few moves were good. You deprived W of some eyespace and took the corner. Also, you have a chance to run W into the middle and for some decent moyo for yourself.

See the variation.];W[pb];B[qb]C[aqualung [24k?\]: mert];W[nb]
TR[rd]C[>> All this happened because you decided to play the marked stone. Yes, that one stone made a difference. Now your corner group is in danger AND your M16 stone has been completely isolated. Not good. See the previous variation.]

;W[ln];B[mo]C[>>Good.];W[on];B[pn]TR[mp]C[>>I'd be a little happier extending at N4, for various reasons.

1) Prevent J3 from extending into your territory.
2) Prevent any chance of O6 stones from escaping.
3) To strengthen your N5 group.];W[mj];B[lg]TR[mh]C[I'm trying to run and take the upper right corner, I'm not entirely sure that I'm going about it correctly.

>>A cut right here would be quite severe. Also in this case, you should concentrate on eliminate eyespace before you seal him in.]

After reviewing, how might be a better way to invade?

I thought this move would be the only weakness in the wall because I have H9 and G8 now. My goal was to take the group of white stones on H8 down to J5. This was a nervous move for me because I'm not confident in close combat and typically can't pull off an invasion.

>> There is no way to invade his territory. The only reason you succeed is because he misread the shape.]

C[Just killing dead groups and fortifying my walls.. Were these moves even required? If I know the group is dead and I control the area, should I just leave it be and let the scoring do the work later?

>> At this stage (regarding your level) it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a group is dead or alive. If you're up ahead by a lot, kill it for fun. But if its a close game, it will cost u a few points because if a group is already dead, then each stone you add costs 1 point (it fills in territory that is supposedly already yours!)]

My best performance to date and I think I have a lot to learn from this game. I thank you again for taking the time to review my game and can't wait to hear your thoughts. If you would like to continue discussions or get together for a game or two, email me at halo5@revgum.com . Thanks again!

>> Well done. You will develop into a decent player soon. Work on those life and death problems and play more games. Build up that experience and you will break out of the 20k ranks very soon.]
