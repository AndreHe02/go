*Hi, I'm a IGS 15k so take what I say with a grain of
salt];W[pq]C[Loial [25k?\]: hello
Waya3 [30k?\]: hi];B[dd];W[jd];B[me]C[Is N15 good? If I play Q10,D10,K4 is it much better?

*D-10 is the best as it sets up a nice moyo.  M-15
doesn't help you or hurt your opponent.];W[md];B[ne]C[Is O15 alright? or should I play O16 instead?

Neither, just tenuki and play D-10.  Of the two O-16
is best];W[nd];B[oe];W[od];B[pe];W[pc];B[qc]C[No, you just set up a wall.  Make use of it either
approach Q-3 or play D-10.  Save the settling plays
for the endgame];W[pb];B[qb];W[fc];B[cf];W[cc];B[dc]C[This starts an exchange that builds a black wall
with no potential.];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[ee];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]
;B[fb]C[should I connect at E17 instead?

connect];W[ec];B[gb];W[gc];B[hc];W[gd]
(;B[he]C[I think H15 is a bad move, should I play H16 or J18
instead?

You should attack to make life but save it for later.  You are playing for nickels when dollars are out
there.];W[hd];B[id]C[J16 is bad move right? should I play J17 or J15 or
there's much better];W[ic];B[hb];W[ie];B[ge]C[i think J18 is the best move but still my percentage
to protect the E18 group is very low];W[ib];B[fd];W[pj];B[po]
C[I think I should play at E16 instead

No need, white won't play there.  Notice that nice
wall going to waste];W[ed]C[Better to protect at D15 or F15? I have chosen to
play at F15

I stand corrected.  What would happen if you played
J-16?];B[fe];W[de];B[df];W[qo];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[op];B[np]

K-4];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[qj];B[rk];W[pk];B[sk]
C[I think there's much better move than T9

Yes];W[pl];B[pm];W[rn];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[mk];B[ni]
C[is O10 much better?

Yes, the ladder favors you  but what is so important
about those two stones?];W[mm];B[ll];W[nj];B[mg];W[mn];B[mp]

Ok, you both need to practice tesuji like on
www.goproblems.com and study sensei's library.  Both
are linked on this website.    Never be satisfied by the mistakes of others.  And
don't hope for them.];W[fp];B[fn];W[fm];B[em];W[gn];B[eq];W[fq]

group =)
Loial [25k?\]: you played very well in the end
Waya3 [30k?\]: my 4th game 4th loss
Emf [19k\]: and also the k1 group wasn't really alive
if you played correctly =)
Waya3 [30k?\]: i thought so
Emf [19k\]: then you would have a few more points =)
* Emf mentioned that B can kill the W lower right
group by R3; how can that possible? W can easily kill
the R3 stone
