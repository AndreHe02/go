AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Black plays a much stronger player .. more than nine stones difference!!
So he does well to not lose by more.   Some tips:

When you have nine stone advantage play solidly .. with as few
cutting points as possible .. give white territory so that you
can get strong ... study life and death problems .. they will
help your reading ability and help you to see when a group is
dead and not worth playing in ... when you attack do not do it
to kill a group unless you know you can if you doubt it then
attack to build territory..

I have enjoyed looking at your game .. play well and carry on
getting pleasure from this wonderful game

Robin];W[fc]C[When you play a nine stone game you just need to think of keeping
your stones connected.]

is problamatic so better to play]

time to play a big move];B[fi];W[eh];B[gh];W[fq]C[Better to make white heavy now]

(;B[dr];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]C[Better to build solid wall for black as because marked group
is dead white is too strong to attack. If you build a wall than
you will gain elsewhere .. see variation]

I like o11 it gives you possible wide area in upper rt corner]
