C[Hello, I am kungfu, IGS 4k*. My e-mail address is:
FRL8@ROGERS.COM.

This game was played on June 8th between myself and howcome, IGS 1d*. I played black.

Any comments you have for me would be greatly appreciated :) I am particularly interested in the aspects of my play which are not yet up to shodan strength.

==============

hi, alain, 2k* IGS

not sure I'm strong enough to make good comments, so I asked some help from my son : MHDC 4d* IGS]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[qj];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[oc]C[ I feel this is a good move considering white's L16.

==============

yes];W[nd];B[nb]C[Since white responded to p17, why not o18 as well?

90% of the dan players I play in even games will respond to this move. I know it's not a good move, but could you please explain why this move might be good if white responds to it? Also, maybe, could you suggest a better move in this situation vs. black o18? thanks.

==============

tenuki also possible here for white, see a possible variation with C11

O18 usefull to protect the san-san]
(;W[mb]C[I feel I gained a psychological victory here.];B[fq]

==============

bad move   rather play K4 too use your almost san ren sei];W[cq]

(;B[dj]C[Why? Well, I don't trust white and thought I would see how he would respond. I thought that it might turn out to be a nice pressing down manouvre, which would make the left not as important as it seems. So my goals now include connection with d10.

==============

but the 2 stones D2+F3 are weak now and can be attacked

H4 better than J3];W[nq]C[
H3 to attack black];B[iq]C[
O3 is a "Thank you move"];W[kq];B[oq];W[np]C[I feel pretty good about my position now, making white korigatachi (frozen shape, i.e. O3/O4 and L3 too close) twice now.

==============

yes]
(;B[qo]C[Hold back a little because I feel good about the 2 white shapes on the top and bottom.

==============

Q6 better];W[cf];B[ef]C[goal is to press down.];W[eg]
(;B[cg];W[dg];B[ch];W[df]C[
you plaid too heavy, E14 is now completly inefficient]
(;B[ck]C[Is this an efficient move or is c8 better?

Maybe I should have c2 first, and then just f10 if white c8/c9.

I would be satisfied if white c8 or c9 after c2.. But I might lost sente.


==============

yes C8 better, it attacks white group below

C2 first bad, white respond at C8 (even C10)];W[cr];B[kr];W[jr]

(;B[lr]C[
K3 better];W[jq];B[lq];W[ir];B[ip];W[ko];B[lp];W[jo];B[go];W[hn]

C[Unfortunately white now has sente];W[qh];B[in];W[io];B[ho]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[gq];B[dq];W[cp];B[fc]C[E17 better];W[ec];B[fe]

R14 ok];W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[rd]
(;B[pe]C[Probably a mistake

no choice, see the possible variation];W[qg];B[rh];W[ri]
(;B[ph]C[
R11 for shibori];W[qi];B[rj]C[Definately a mistake, in my opinion.

==============

yes, Q10 rather];W[pi];B[rc];W[pj];B[sf];W[re];B[si];W[sh];B[sj]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[rl];B[sg];W[se];B[ql];W[pk];B[rm];W[pl]
(;B[qm]C[
take at T8 better,   in the game you loose sente and the occasion to play O13 (as in variation)

it's probably the loosing move];W[sh];B[sl];W[gf]C[Believe it or not I squeezed life out of that group. But white used the resulting power to kill the upper left.

==============

now you have 2 weak groups... you will probably loose one ?]
;B[jd];W[kc];B[he];W[ig];B[hf];W[hg];B[ff];W[gg];B[ge];W[je]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[hb];W[jb];B[ie];W[jf];B[gd];W[ib];B[hc];W[sc]
C[After this attack I resigned.

Anyway, I think white gained some power in the middle and I didn't know how to deal with it.

Thanks for any input you can give me :)

Sincerely,

kungfu, IGS 4k*


==============

yes white is strong on the other side now, and will looseone group
