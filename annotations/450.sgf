AB[gc][cg]C[[I am Black, computer is White. Not sure why I lost. Suspect misplay in the opening is
crucial.\]];W[cc]C[Hello,
let´s have a look!];B[ed]MA[gg][gf][fg]C[[wanted to fight for that corner. too  timid? D7 instead?\]

I´m not sure which corner you speak  of because you played almost in the  center of the board. To attack the  upper left it is to far away.
You have the chance now to play the  first stone in 3 of 4 corners, so I´d  play at one of the marked points.
D7 is more aggressive but not  necessary now.];W[gg];B[ge]C[E3 would attack as good as your  move and your stones would be  almost connected.]
;W[hf];B[ff]C[[wanted to stop from being cut\]

Where? I see no cut at all.
The white move was quite bad, he  should play at the lower edge  because there is more space to  develop. So you can play at the  lower edge e.g.  E3 again.
You won´t kill him probably but you  don´t have to. Keep him under  pressure and make points in the  upper right and lower left corner.]
;W[eh];B[eg]C[[seemed impossible to cut off E2  from the other whites.\]
You´re right.

So, if you want to attack it anyway  play e.g. D2 and secure the corner in  sente.

But better would be to attack the  upper left, because W now has a  solid base in the lower right. You  can´t attack there much effectively.]
;W[fh];B[ce]C[good];W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd]C[[these last 3 moves of mine only  seemed to induce white to solidify  his position unfavorably
to me. should i invade deeper?\]

No, you played well and got a good  result. You don´t have to kill  everything. Give your opponent a  small life while taking some points at  the outside yourself. And so you did  :-)]
;W[gb]
(;B[fc]C[[looking black, it seems like the  game is lost at this point, b/c these  positions closely
define the eventual boundaries.\]

No, see the variation for one  possible (verry peacfull) succession,  B wins by 3 points.  At this point the game is close  because you can get a lot of points  in the lower left, what you did not in  the actual game.]
;W[fb]
(;B[ac]LB[hb:A][bb:B]C[A is bigger because you´re not only  preventing W from making points  there but even can get some on  yourself.

Locally B is slightly bigger. See  variation.];W[bb];B[ab];W[hc]
C[good];B[hd];W[ha]C[???];B[ic];W[hb];B[ba]C[[maybe it was an error to spend  three moves up at the top left, since  it seemed to let him
develop on the top right. should i  have forseen there was no way to  prevent him building an
eye? I was planning to work my way  toward J8 and D9.\]

Yes, playing in the upper right  earlier would have been better. But  he has to answer your last move to  live at the upper edge and afterwards  you still can play D2 an win!]
;W[cb];B[aa]C[No!
This is gote and much to small!];W[ch]C[!!!]
(;B[dh]C[Better B2, see variation.];W[di];B[dg];W[ib]C[better B2!]
;B[id]C[again to small
again better B2];W[ie];B[he]C[dito];W[if]C[B2];B[fg]C[Why?]
;W[ca];B[ad];W[hh];B[gi]C[Before you can try to kill a group you  have to seal it in!]
;W[bh]C[This is white´s winning move. You  had plenty of chances to prevent it!]
;B[bg];W[ag];B[af];W[ah];B[gf];W[gh];B[bi]C[[i make some futile invasion  attempts here onward.\]

The game is over now, there is one  last point to get at E7.]
;W[ci];B[ig];W[hg];B[ei];W[fi];W[ec];B[dd]C[That´s it.
Over all I want to emphasize two  things.
1. You too often play with aggressive  intentions. Remember that Go is not  a game of capturing but of territory!

2. Play your own game!  You don´t have to answer every  move of your opponent and you  don´t have to kill all his groups.
You should try to play the biggest  move at every time, and often (!) this  is to secure your own group or to  enlarge your territory.


If you have any more questions feel  free to ask!

Bye, Martin])
