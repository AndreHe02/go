cj: Hello, and thanks for the review.  I was not able to take advantage of my opponents weak groups, so I really need help in this.  I'm 9k KGS and played as white this game.

Hi, I will give you my conclusion right in the beginning:

You wanted to know how to attack your opponents weak groups. You can attack weak groups much more effectively when your own groups already have a base. Here it was more like weak groups against weak groups, which makes the outcome uncertain and depends much on fighting skill.
Settling a group often seems small and slow, but in order to attack it makes things much easier.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[qf]C[cj: Is it always a good idea to respond to the star point in this opening?

To play an approach move against the star point ist very unusual as second move, actually I didn't see it in any high dan games. I think you may respond locally as well as play in another corner.

The thing is, when playing the star point it is not possible to make a corner enclosure with a second move there, you need three moves for that. And that's the reason that an approach against 4-4 is not as urgent as against 3-4 or 3-5 or to take aonther empty corner.]

(;W[ql]C[Here we can see it's going to be a hard fighting game, because there are many weak groups, either black or white.]
;B[on];W[nk];B[mh];W[le];B[cc];W[lc]C[cj: Maybe playing out at P4 is better?

p4 is very big, but I like m17.  If you don't play there bleck can keep on hunting you.]

;B[cf];W[ob]C[cj:  I feel this is worthless.  Perhaps even my M18 move was.

well, black has to answer, but it's more like a big endgame move or a ko threat]

;B[dn];W[eg];B[jq];W[lq]C[cj: I think this is probably a mistake as well.  I'd rather have played at H3 so he couldn't have as strong a base.

yes, h3 is much better. Not only because B can make a base now, but because he also makes your left group weak. the right group is strong and alive, so this is absolutely wrong direction.]

It's ok, it's sente and makes good shape for your group. Black d13 would make it locally eyeless.]

(;W[lj]LB[ii:A]C[cj: I think my midgame is full of badly attempted cuts.  Any advice about how I should have played here, or have I already lost the game?

The game looks quite even at this point. But the cut is too hard, this only works in high handicap games :)
A looks like a more promising cut. I think your problem is the same as it was mine when I was in your strength... you always want to kill everything without paying attention to your own weak groups.]

it is hard to win now, but still possible. k13 and m10 were unnecessary sacrifices.]

of course this is hard to read out. but instinctively you should have played the cut where there's more space for you to run. As the game is very close it's ok to risk everything in a fight, if you can't really read it out. Otherwise it would have been better just to threaten the cuts.]
