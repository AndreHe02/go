C[Hi,

This was an interesting game overall.  I made some poor choices later on but I thought the beginning went off rather well.  I've gone through and commented some spots where there was a question or something I think should have been done differently.  I have comments through move 174 or so.



NM: I will try to help you as best as I can. i will try to answer all your points you have made.

Neil];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc]C[ok, ive just read direction of play by takeo, so what he says about the star points is that they want extensions down sides, 
the black corner enclose wants an extension r10, you probably already know this.]
;W[qi]TR[qj][qo]C[I think in retrospect that since the lower right is at 3-4 and not 4-4 I should have scooted over to R10 instead.  I could play at R5 but the pinch is awfully good for black.  It's probably fine, but looks more difficult.

NM: Not a common fuseki move, playable probably.
playing q5 is common i think

I will be using moyogo to help analyse your game, this gives me better knowledge. For instance q5 is indeed the most popular move . r5 is playable, r11 does not occur in pro games , r9 and r10 are reasonable moves

yeah so r5 is not so good because black pincer at r9]
(;B[qo]C[ok so white has maia to make a base so k3 still biggest point, from your star point and blacks corner q3]
;W[jq]C[good move
sometimes l3 is playable- dont know which is better here];B[jd]
C[this move is ok, but c10 mybe better];W[qf]TR[dj]C[I also considered D10, R11 still has miai.  however the reverse sente move R13 looked very big indeed so I took this while it was still possible.

since it is miai i would probably leave it. h17 is a  good move here

certainly d10 is very big too, make 3 star pints];B[cj]C[ok , black takes it.]
;W[cl];B[cf]
(;W[fc]C[i would perhaps play c15 then b d14 , then white f17
because black b16 here

moyogo suggests c16 or c12 as good moves. c12 is interesting and a fighting move.]

(;W[bm]TR[cm]C[I should have just gone straight, almost entirely removes the D5 aji.]
;B[bs]
(;W[mq]C[perhaps attaching at p3 is an idea. usually only when white needs to settle quick unlike this situation where white is thick at bottom.

another area is the top which look unsettled and first to play there will have an advantage, so is mybe sente whereas n3 is very gote]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[jp];B[mp];W[nq];B[op];W[bd]TR[ql]C[My other idea here was R8, but this seemed better.  Plus, C14 to C10 is a little stretched, and I'd like to abuse the funny character of it.

NM:
perhaps try c15 d14 exchange then r8];B[qk];W[pk]C[I didn't like jumping straight out, so I attached.  This may not be that good... hard for me to know, but it seems alright.

good move.];B[pl];W[pj];B[ol]
(;W[di]TR[nj]C[Maybe this is premature, but I feel okay at R11 without more work right now.  It will take multple moves to completely surround me.]

l9 ok];B[ik];W[np]C[This cut is vulnerable now, so I abuse.  Maybe too small?
perhaps defend white at top better and reduce black p15.

it is a shame white cannot get an attack on black now, perhaps the d10 group or the k16 stone and j9 group.

go is mainly about reading ability, hence why some strong russian chess players do very well at go also.

white was in a winning position, and tried somethibng risky, but youve learnt a lot by playing some crazy go and the more you try things out the better you will become. so experiment its fun. If your trying to win in a tournamnet, perhaps mybe not so risky :)

just looking at the game here on last move. black got down to h1 inside of white moyo that should never have happened. defending first correct in reverse sente. 

If youve not heard of moyogo, it really is excellent. moyogo.com
Id be happy to play a few teaching games on kgs sometime with you (im rhubarb)

Sorry if my explanations are a bit short, i am not really strong enough to give you lots of help. 5k kgs. if you ve learn one/two things then good.
