(;B[ko]LB[kn:A][kq:B]C[Now here I need to learn about capping. I guess capping by attaching is a bad idea. A play at B would probably have been safest, but I didn't want white to get thickness in the center. Could I have capped at A and eventually killed off the invasion?

phi:  If you want to surround and attack your opponent, play A. A play where you played (L5) makes your oponent strong. I am not sure, if you are able to kill off the  invasion at all. Play at A (L6) and your oponent has a hard game even if he manages to escape or to make a small live.  Another possibility is to make yourself strong on the lower left side playing K3 (see variation).]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[lo];B[kn];W[lp];B[kq]LB[jo:a][io:b][jq:c][lq:d]
C[phi: This move is dangerous. First you are not sure, if you can get the stone at A (K5).  Playing at B (J5) kills the single white stone in a ladder.  I would have played C(K3). Playing C you still have the possibility to atack A and it makes your position on the left stronger.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[lq];B[kr]LB[mr:a][no:b][rn:c]C[phi:  You are going to loose this one.  I would have reinforce the right bottom corner. Probably palying at A (N2), B(O5) or C (S6), or reinforced the lower left side: J3.]
;W[jr];B[lr];W[mr];B[mq];W[ls];B[nr];W[ks];B[kl];W[jn]
(;B[pj]C[Was Q10 a reasonable move here?

phi: I would have tried to kill the two white single stones first playing at A (K7). See variation. Even if you can not kill them, it makes you a stronger position.

If you fell to play at Q10, I prefer R10, because your oponent already has a stone on the 3rd line (R6).]
;W[km];B[ln];W[lm];B[mn];W[mo];B[mm];W[jm]C[phi: white could play K8 with nearly the same result, but a bit more pressure on the lonely black stone in the center.]
;B[ol];W[np];B[nq]C[phi: I only see 4 points in this move. I prefer K17, or some invasion on the left side (eg. C15).]

(;B[ri]CR[ri]LB[jd:A]TR[nj][nk]C[What's best move here? Stabilize upper right corner with marked stone, or maybe something around A?

phi: I prefer something around A. It makes your ladder (the two marked stones) work.]
;W[oi];B[pf];W[ph];B[oh]LB[qh:A]C[Another blunder. Should have played inside at A

phi: Yes, I would.];W[qi];B[qh];W[qj];B[pg];W[pi];B[rg];W[eq]

(;B[cj]LB[dg:a][ch:b]C[Is there a better move here? I wanted to make a base. Was the 3-point jump too timid? Would a 4-point been better?

;W[gk];B[gj];W[fj];B[eh]LB[fi:a]C[phi: I would have played at A (F11). If white playes A, black has many cutting points.]

(;B[eg]TR[di][dh][eh][eg]LB[fg:a]C[phi: don't play any stones in a lost ladder. The marked stones are already lost.  To make your "spike" you ask later, this would be the point to start it at A(F13). See variation.]

phi. Yes.];B[gq];W[fr];B[hr];W[gs];B[hs];W[rj];B[qc]C[When is it a good time to protect against 3-3 invasion?

phi: I am not sure, if a 3x3 Invasion still works, because you are now very strong in the upper right corner. But normaly a 3x3 invasion is stoped earlyer.]

;W[hk];B[gc]TR[hb][ib][ja][jb][jc][ka]LB[ii:A]C[This lets me kill White's group, but only because she punishes me by taking my group around A]

(;W[ih]C[phi:  this is 20 points for white in the center. But white is going to loose much more (about 30 points) on the top, if black playes G18 now.]

(;B[io]C[Cut my losses here.

phi: This was a mistake of black. White can rescue the top by playing G18 herself. Even if blacks saves the center (20) Points, white saves the top left group. See variation.]
