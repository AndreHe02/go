-Note to Reviewer-

I won this game, but it was close. In general, I'd just like to know what I did wrong in the game, but also what I did right. I'd really like to improve, but I feel rather stuck at my rank, so I would like to figure out what prevents me from being a stronger player. Thank you!]

C[As you can see, now you have what they call "a dragon". That is an eye-less group usually in the center, running desperately looking for life. And you didn't get anything in exchange.

The solution would be to not make any shape mistake (like the bad atari before). If you realise the mistake, just play elsewhere and sacrify the 2 stones. At least you will get compensation in other part of the board while your opponent captures your two stones.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[oi];B[ni]C[This is called "pushing the trolley from behind". You will be always at least 1 liberty behind your opponent, so you will lose the damezumari (fight of liberties) and that Z group will become mochikomi (stones in the opponent's territory that didn't get any compensation), in other words, making mochikomi is the worst possible thing to do in Go. Is like putting your stones in the hands of the opponent and passing the turn.

Whenever you make a move, do it always thinking about getting a compensation for it. You can always sacrifice stones (even small groups) in order to get some compensation and this is NOT mochikomi. 

I used to make some mochikomi and when I finally realised it, I improved from 3 to 5 stones. Is something that will make you go to shodan. Good luck!]

*************************************************************

A FEW COMMENTS TO MAKE YOU IMPROVE
*************************************************************

As I can see, you have good ideas, so I think that you can improve quite a lot.

You should work on your shape problems by visiting www.goproblems.com and solving some problems every week. Even better would be to buy some Go book about making good shapes like "Get Strong at Making Shape" from Kiseido (is one of the latest ones) or even better, I reccomend you the FREE electronic book Shape up!

Just Google it or ask for it in Go-related sites such as gobase.org (I think I downloaded from there).

Another of your problems is that your thinking is very linear. You only focus on one point and then look for the best local movement, without taking into account the whole board (like computers do). This one is a tough one to save, but if you do, you will make it to shodan.

A good advice totally independent from your game is: 
"Always think about two possible continuations and let the opponent choose whichever he likes". When you play like that, is because you are playing with good style and you just don't care about your opponent because you are being efficient. He will think that he is playing his way, but you are the one playing with him like a puppet master.

Good luck with your improvement!];B[ce];W[sc];B[sd];W[kn];B[el]
