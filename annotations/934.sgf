C[Early on in this game I believe I made some major mistakes that I would like to understand where I could have played better

forfun (FF) - Thanks for the opportunity to review an interesting game.  There is a lot of good material here in an epic battle that seesawed back and forth several times.    I think that W let B off easy in the lower right corner and right side.  I have tried to indicate where W could have thought about some alternatives.  In exchange for a big corner/side territory for B, W obtained a beautiful wall - but in gote.  This let B seize tengen and left W with a tough problem to solve.  W continued to battle , however, and got back into the game when B allowed W to break into the left side.  Finally B managed to become thick in the center and was able to win in the yose.

From W's comments I feel that W several times formed an overly negative view of his chances.  W seemed to assume that B could achieve more than was acually the case (similarly that W could achieve less).  As a result W played too conservatively at several important points.  In Go it is important to keep in mind that your opponent also has chances and plans of his/her own.  However, it is also important not to overestimate those chances.  We should always be questioning our analysis and conclusions, "can she really break through (kill me, escape, make two eyes, etc.) here?"

I have added a number of variations.  Some are long, some short.  You should question them all - there is no guarantee that they are correct :-)]

(;W[og]C[I see most people play q13 here, as I understand it, the reason is to remove a liberty from blacks group, but I just do not think the value of one liberty compares to the value of the peep at o13....am I wrong in thinking this?

FF - I think that you are confusing two different joseki here.  Playing the jump to 8 and the shoulder hit at 10 happens in two different positions:
1. When Black 1 is at Q17 (kosumi).  In this case there is no invasion of the corner and White will finish the joseki by connecting with the equivalent of 18 (P13) or Q13.
2. When Black 1 is at Q16 (hoshi).  In this case connecting and living in the corner with a play at R17  are miai.  Generally W plays neither at this point.    Connecting is not out of the question.  However, The main reason for doing so should be to invade the upper side (at M17?) in the near future.  Instead of connecting W will normally chose to extend the wall further down the right side.  See the variations.

Personally I do not like this joseki when White has played the mokuhazushi at R5.  The Black stones on the right are not really threatened and therefore Black has succeeded at countering White's original choice in the bottom right.  I think that it is natural to play a counter pincer around R10 after jumping out at P14.]

(;W[nq]C[this move I felt was questionable, but it seemed that responding at q5 or around there would be too passive

FF - See variarion];B[ro]
(;W[qn];B[rn];W[pp];B[qq]C[at this point, I really wanted to play at tengen, but I felt that as long as my wall had a hole at q8, it would be meaningless

FF - See variation.]
(;W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[jj];W[ed]C[this was an attempt to mabye start up a fight so my wall would become valuable, I wonder if there was a better place to do this.

FF - The natural alternative used to be around M17.  However, When B connected underneath, all threats against the side stones disappeared so it would be difficult to attack the upper right corner now.  B can always play in the corner (for example around S16) without fearing the impact of any W replies on the right side group.

For better or worse W has to try the area around E16.];B[fc]
C[FF - See the comments and analysis of W40.  This looks like an overplay.]
;W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[cc]C[I was totally at a loss for what to do here, so these moves are sort of desperation.

FF - There is no need for desperation.  To feel that at this point:
* You must have decided that B37 was a good move.  Was it?  Why?  Remember the saying, "Play attachments to live"?  Black has invited White to attach against his stones.  If you accept are you badly off?
* You must have decided that you could not let B push you out into the center.  This is an incorrect assessment I think.  If you continue to move out and B follows, The B stone at J16 becomes overconcentrated (it already is somewhat after B 37-39).  You still have your strong wall on the right so you should not fear that B will gain too much by pushing you out.  All that pushing you out does is limit the amount of territory that B can build on the left.  Of course B will make *some*.  That is only natural.  But if he forces himself to play low, he will not gain much.  The attachment in the corner will probably remain for some time to come.  There is no rush to play it now.  (See variation)]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[dc];W[cb];B[dd];W[db];B[ee];W[eb];B[fe];W[bd]
;B[be];W[ac]C[At this point, I was worried because my group had wound up living fairly small, and he gained outside influence to nullify mine.

FF - Again, I think that you are taking too negative a view of the situation.  Although Black has enclosed W in the corner:
* Black is open on the side at F18 and can only close the gap in gote.
* White has a huge attachment at B14 that seriously limits what B can make on the left.  Again this weakness can only be closed in gote by B.
* The upper right corner is still open and W can also still invade the upper side.]
;B[cn];W[en]C[this was another attempt to use my wall, this time I believe that I played right

FF - I agree.];B[cp];W[dq];B[cq]
(;W[qc]C[FF - This looks badly timed.  There was no rush to play here as W can still enter the top.  The issue is still who gets what in the center.  I think W should want to play up from the left in order to disrupt the relationship between the stones on D10 and tengen if possible.  The W wall on the right really comes into its own if W can threaten the tengen stone.  Unfortunately it is not clear what is the best way to proceed here.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[gn]C[and again I was worried here, I could not see a good way to resolve this situation to my advantage, so I think I got desperate. This was where the game started to go seriously downhill

FF - This time I agee that some negative thoughts seem appropriate.  Strangely enough, however, from here W managed to fight back into the game (with some help from B :-).]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[fm];B[io]C[FF - This is a nice play.  I do not see any good way to take advantage of it ...]

(;W[jc]C[FF - The timing of this move is unfortunate.  It looks like W should push once more. See variation.]
;B[kf]C[FF - This is a very important move for B.  It makes him very thick in the center and threatens to close off the center completely.]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[je]C[this connection felt bad, but I though that if I played at k14 to connect, it would only be worse

FF - It is not clear why you felt it would be worse.  Once W has played K17, W is threatening to cut at N16.  You should want to keep pressing B.  K14 seems to push into the center more aggressively than K15.]

;B[eh]
(;W[hj];B[ji]C[FF - The exchange of K11 for K12 is very good for B.  It connects the top B stones to the bottom in sente and becomes very thick throughout the center.  Before this the cut at N16 is a potentially significant threat.  W should probably play K11 before playing H10.]
