C[Katsushiro [18k\]: Black
batosai [18k\]: White];B[pq]C[any comments or tips would be greatly appreciated

I'll do what I can.  It's a bit funny being too critical of a game you won by a large margin, but I assume that's what you want.  Regardless of the comments, well played and well done.]

(;B[qj]LB[qh:a]C[Is there a better extention for me here?

This is fine.  It's a bit loose, but that is actually ok at this point.  White could jump in at 'a', but you would make profit in the fight.

Another very common line of play is shown in variation 2.];W[po]
;B[nq];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]LB[qh:a][pj:b]C[now an invasion at 'a' might be harder to deal with.  At this point, a move at 'b' seems good.  It solidifies the black group against the invasion at 'a' and also restricts the white group.]
;B[iq];W[op];B[oq];W[fc];B[cg]LB[ci:a][dj:b][cj:c]C[Interesting move.  But I think it's too close to 2 and 16.  If white answers around 'a', you won't have room to make an extension along the edge, and will have to run out into the middle, which should be good for white on the left side and top left.

I would instead make this move around 'b' or 'c'.  This makes a large moyo (territorial framework) in the lower left for black and reduces the value of 2 and 16 by cramping white's ability to make an extension on the left side.]
;W[cn]C[Instead white moves here, which invites you to make a pincer and an extension from 17.]
;B[cl]LB[ck:a]C[And you do.  Very good.  'a' would be a good move too.  A bit more connection to 17 and still a very strong attack on 18.  In any case, the pincer was the correct move.]
;W[en];B[fp]C[Very good.];W[fl];B[gn]LB[dj:a]C[Hmmm.  17-19 is rapidly getting weaker, and now would be a good time to help that group out with a move like 'a']
;W[eo];B[ep];W[co]LB[bp:a]C[White should have reached under to 'a' to make more of a base.]
;B[ek]C[Good.  This pressures white and helps your weak stones.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[dm];B[cp];W[bo];B[qc]C[This move is questionable.  See variation 2.]

(;W[qd];B[rd];W[pc];B[rc];W[pf];B[pg]LB[qg:a]C[You leave a cutting point at 'a'.  I think you would have a hard time dealing with a cut now.  See variation 2 for an example.  There are many ways it could play, but black isn't really strong enough here to do well in the fight.  Simply moving at 'a' would take a big profit and leave you with a very strong group.]

(;W[of]C[Instead white moves this way.  Very bad.  Black is now way ahead.  Black has about 30 points on the bottom, maybe 20 on the top and right.

White may have 15 in the top right, but it's loose.  Center top ??  Maybe 10 points in top right.  No meaningful territory on the bottom half of the board.

Assuming black doesn't get cut apart on the left, that's about a 25 point lead.]
;B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf]C[Interesting.  Whites stones on the right are really getting hurt by this wall.  They could easily die.  Furthermore, moves 40, 42 and 44 leave white with a lot of stones in a small space -- almost no profit while black gets this strength.]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf]C[Now white is making profit, but there is no hope of white making any territory on the lower 2/3 of the board.  White will have to try to live and reduce black's territory]
;B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[gg]C[Good.  This helps your weak group on the left.]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[gf];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg]C[Black no longer has any weaknesses.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[de];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[ed];B[hl]C[Very nice.  Attack by surrounding.  Hurts both white groups.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[gl]C[Now the question is];B[gj]LB[fn:a][em:b]
C[A move at 'a' would be better.  It makes 'b' into a false eye.  White has nowhere to run going up so would have to try to make two eyes on the edge.]
;W[fk];B[fj]LB[ej:a][dk:b]C[When you are attacking, beware leaving cutting points like this.   A simpler move than 75 would be just moving at 'a'  White still has nowhere to go and black has no weaknesses that way.]
;W[fn];B[do];W[cm];B[bm]C[I think I was too ambitious here...where should I have played?]

LB[nl:a]C[Missed the snapback at 'a'.  But that's ok, you are still well ahead.]
;W[ak];B[ai];W[bn];B[bh];W[nl];B[ll];W[lm];B[km]C[At this point, black is ahead by about 17 points (See variation 2).  Failing to take the endgame points costs white another 17 points.]
