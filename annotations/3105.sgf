;B[pd]C[Here I play black. This  is a game on Dragon Go  server. Obviously,  I'd really appreciate your comments. I made one very obvious mistake (failing to secure gruop around A15) and lots of less obvious.

Thanks!

Most of the comments are for Black, occasionally there may be some comments for White.\]]

C[[Broege: A or B would be better - typically White can dive to C but Black protects the corner by D.
Black C does not put pressure on White nor protects the corner.\]]
;W[qf];B[fq]LB[qe:A][of:B]C[[Broege: Personally I would try to protect the corner by playing A (not that there is much left to protect). You can also put pressure and begin fight by playing B.\]]
;W[rd];B[cn]LB[pc:A][of:B][oe:C]C[[Broege: Black stones around A are under much pressure now - imagine White B or C.\]]
;W[eo];B[go]LB[cq:A]C[[Broege: The typical answer is A - White is pushed into the center and Black wants to take advantage of this.\]]
;W[co];B[en]LB[dr:A]C[[Broege: A would put more pressure on White as he will have to make another enforcement move.\]]
;W[bn];B[fc]LB[dn:A]C[[Broege: Tenuki in this situation is a bit risky. What about White at A?\]]

[bb:B][hb:C][bc:D]C[[Broege: Typically Black plays A here. White has to play B - if not Black will live in the corner by playing D - and this gives Black time to play C\].]
;W[dj];B[hd]C[I was oscillating between pushing on D10 stone and this move.]
;W[id];B[nd]LB[hc:A][oc:B][od:C][pc:D]C[[Broege: Black A solidifies the top left stones and keep them out of danger. The move played is questionable after White B, Black C, White D\]]
;W[mc];B[nf]LB[oe:A][oc:B]C[Here I decided that I to not want to be locked in a corner and I do not want two white groups to connect.

[Broege: The aim is very good but Black is quite weak here; main weaknesses are at A and B - a White move there cuts the Black group.\]]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[rc]LB[qc:A]C[[Broege: Here White could peep at A to gain more slightly more room.\]]
;B[gf]C[[Broege: This move is too greedy - it tries to surround White group with two weak Black groups. As you can see from the game it couldn't work out.\]]
;W[ff];B[he];W[eg];B[dh];W[df];B[ch]LB[dl:A]C[[Broege: Perhaps play at A could be more welcomed - it would probably allow to strengten at least one of the groups - above or below.\]]

;W[bj];B[dq]LB[dr:A][cq:B][dq:C]C[[Broege: There is a saying that one should not attach to enemy stone. Here it is very true - by playing A Black forces White to protect the corner. By playing C Black invites White to play B which greatly weakens C stone.\]]

[bb:E]C[[Broege: Locally A is the better move. Globally - I would go for living with top-left group at E orstrengtening the Black moyo - by playing around B or C or just close the corner at D.

The move played (and A) are too small - they are typical yose moves. As both Black and White are quite safe such moves are not urgent at all. This of course applies to the whole sequence played.\]]

A very funny configuration with lots of open space.

[Broege: Quite a nice center. It's a pity that Black lost those two groups in the top left.
As a summary - I think you play tenuki too often - if a situation is not stable tenuki is usually not the best option.
You could also pay more attention to life & death (well, that's true for almost anybody, including myself).
