C[Hello, this is a game between two >25k (approximately). I (patu on IGS) played white and I won (W>+40), but I think B could win easily if he connects its center stones. He played very defensively in the fuseki, and I was forced to attack often to get influence in the center. It is the first time I manage to live in the center...
Every hint or remark are welcome, in particular:
-in the fuseki: I think I was far behind. Did I miss too many "big points" (where? when?)? Could I tenuki sometimes?
-in the chuban: Could I stop B extension in the left side? Since B had at this time no "weak" group I tried to reduct its potential. My strategy in the center was sort of a last chance tentative (separate its center stones from the other ones). Could B save its stones?
Thank you very much (you may also comment in French, my native language;-))]

C[As for the center, B was careless to let his stones die.]
;B[qf];W[nd];B[gc];W[fd]LB[fc:A][df:B][id:C]C[This answer was a bit vague for me, but I wanted to attack him. Maybe A of a pincer at C? B was too peaceful, but maybe?

A: Well, it depends on what you want to achieve. This move by itself is not good/bad. It is an option. Is it agressive? Not really.   But it want to create influence on the left side, you have it!]
;B[qi];W[qo]C[A: If the aim was the corner, the move should have been at R4.]

(;B[qm]LB[qq:a]C[A:This answer is not so good. How about R3?]
;W[pn]C[should take R3

R3 is the critical point here...];B[qk]C[A: too tight.

better one line to the left.];W[qq]C[A: B should have taken this place long before :)]
;B[lq];W[np]LB[nn:A]C[Was this move too ambitious? A better?

A: You do not need to start a fight here when there are much bigger places to play. If I were B I would definitely ignore this move and play somewhere else.]
;B[nq];W[no];B[mp];W[mo];B[iq];W[ep];B[er]C[I was surprised by this B move and played something odd, too.

A: th move was probably a typo but who knows.];W[cn];B[dq];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[co];B[bq];W[dp]C[A: B6 would be better.];B[ap];W[eq]

;W[ib];B[ie];W[hf];B[jf];W[jd]C[Was this nozoki useful? Could I attack this group in the large?

A: Hmmm... No.]
(;B[id];W[if];B[je];W[lf];B[bj];W[bl]C[Could I tenuki and follow my attack of the upper group?

A: Hmm... I would try to figure which is more important. If the group in the middle is important, I would play on the left, get a bit stronger and then attack B group in the middle from right.

If other way around, I would attack the middle group from the left and then attack the others...

But I guess the answer is option 1. So playing here is not bad.]
;B[bk]C[A: This answer was wrong. It had to be at A8. Now W has to play A8 and cut...

By the way, there is nothing W can do to prevent the link.]
