C[Hello !

My name is Julien Wiesel. I play as "LeWiZ" on KGS and I'm about 3k.

I'm french. I'll try to use my best english ^^

I hope the comment will help you. If you have any question about the comment, ask me at julien.wiesel@gmail.com !]

;B[cm]LB[cn:B][co:A]C[This move looks strange to me. It doesn't attack the corner and doesn't attack the white stone on left. White can answer 'a' : he is happy with his corner and the white stone on the left is still ok. I would have played at 'b'.]

;W[rr];B[cp];W[cn]LB[dq:A]C[I would have played at 'a' and tried to build a moyo at the bottom. Here 'a' is leaved as a cutting point.]

(;B[bn];W[dn]LB[eo:A]C[This move is very slow and not so useful. 'a' makes a better shape.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[rm]C[This move is heavy. R6 stone is not important because of the white stone just below. You should not spend another move to save it.]
;W[ns];B[ps];W[ic]LB[hc:B][qe:A]C[Strange move. I would have approched the corner at 'a'. If you want to attack the upper left corner, 'b' looks better.]
;B[mc]C[Now white doesn't have a base and is too far for an attack against the upper left corner.]
;W[gd]C[This move helps black's corner.];B[fd];W[ld]C[Now white helps black to build his upper right corner, and he has no base.]
;B[md];W[lc];B[le]LB[me:A]C[I would have simply played at 'a', which is a very solid move that makes the corner very strong and still attack the white top group.]

(;W[rc]LB[rc:A][rd:A]C[White should have played more lightly, at 'a'.]
;B[rd]C[I think white can't live from here.];W[pb]

(;B[nb]LB[nb:A][rb:A]C[White plays at 'a' and lives.]
(;W[gc]LB[rb:B][gc:A];B[ke];W[kd]LB[ge:A]C[This is heavy. White won't make much territory here so I would have played at 'a' in the center.]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[lb];W[kc];B[ie];W[kb]LB[ge:A]C[Unuseful. White should run in the center with 'a']

;W[id];B[je];W[ce]LB[oi:A][in:B][on:C]C[It looks like a yose move. There are still big points on the board and this one is not urgent, for exemple 'a', 'b', or 'c'.]
;B[bd]LB[oi:A][on:C][io:B]C[Black should ignore this move and play 'a', 'b', or 'c'.]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[ff];B[mf]LB[oi:B][on:A]C[This cut doesn't look so dangerous. Black can play increase his moyo with 'a' or 'b' and then attack any cutting stone.]
;W[ec]C[Ouch ! ^^];B[ed];W[dc];B[db];W[cb]C[There is a complicated fight if black wants to try to save his stones... I can't tell if it works.]

(;B[on]LB[dd:B][on:A];W[ef];B[mn]C[This move is big. It both increases black's moyo and reduce white's. Now black has a nice moyo.]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[qh]LB[kj:A]C[This is too deep, I think. Now white must live. It's hard to choose between invasion and reduction. 'a' is a safe reduction point, but is it severe enough ? White has a nice moyo at the bottom, and has captured the upper left corner, so I would say 'a' is enough (and much safer).]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[pg]LB[ri:A]C[Black should play at 'a' and push white into his thickness on the top. White can't live in my opinion.]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[rf];B[sh]C[This is white's vital point.]
;W[re];B[sd];W[se];B[jo]C[Black need one more move to kill white on the right.]
;W[jp];B[io];W[sg]C[Now white is alive and black's moyo can still be reduced.]
;B[gf];W[ji];B[gh]LB[hi:A]C['a' would have been more severe, I think.]
