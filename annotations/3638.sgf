RE[B+46.5]

C[NA-Hello, my name is Nathan Austin and I will be reviewing your game as best I can.  I will put my initials in front of my comments like here.

First off, I'll try to answer the question I recieved from you with the game review request about whether I think losing the 30k rank is good or not.  I guess this question doesn't really seem to have an obvious answer to me, maybe particularly because I didn't start playing on IGS till I had about 22k on the old system.  I guess my recomendation would be to play at KGS more early because I feel it is more friendly to newer players and that it's easier to use.  You are more likeley to have a stronger player give you a review of the game afterwards and it's generally easier to start conversations.  In the end what matters is the fun you have playing not the rank the server says you have.]

;B[cq];W[dr];B[cr];W[ds];B[co];W[cp];B[bp];W[cs]C[i was very tempted to play e 5 but as my oppent being stronger i feared a reading game but did not let white get off easy for playing such a weak shape!

NA- I don't see E5 working because white has two liberties at the edge of the board.  What I see happening is this if you play E5.  White plays d5.  If black is serious about this strategy he must play d6 otherwise white will, and then will be connected and out.  So after black d6 then white either plays C6 or E6, either of which is a double atari, which means that white will capture and be out.  The choice will just depend on whether white is more interested in trying to get out on the side, or in the center.  I don't see either of you having an advantage here because both of you are in akward and weak shapes.]
;B[bq];W[eo];B[do];W[fo];B[gp];W[es]C[at this point it looked alive again but i dont fee that either of my shape's is that weak and felt like if i got the space i would live

NA-This situation is pretty messy.  I don't think either side has a decisive advantage.  Both have serious things to worry about.  I guess I see white as a little ahead at this point just because the D7 stone at least gives white some options in terms of running if it has to, whereas black has two weak groups split by a white one which is bad because that means that each move white makes carries double the threat value of any move black can make.]

;W[nm];B[ml]C[although white i big and has 2 eyes so cutting it from decreaseing my territory was my only option and by playing p 6 i would force a response and guard was pleased with this (assumeing life at L 1)

NA-I don't really understand your comments here.  Why do you refer to P6 and L1?  From the point of view of keeping influence in the center this move is reasonable but you aren't defending any territory.  It does give your group alittle more security though, which is a good thing.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[pj];W[om];B[pn];W[pl];B[on]C[now i got a fun idea]
;W[no];B[ol];W[nk];B[oj];W[pl]C[i never did care much for connecting is this bad??

NA-Generally, yes.  If you don't connect you will lose alot of games to people who are only alittle bit better than you.  If you stay connected your attacks will be so much more powerful.  Staying connected is one of the most fundamental skills in go.]
;B[nj];W[qi];B[rl];W[mj]C[N9?

NA-This is so much more threatening and can lead to good follow up moves.  I don't really see any advantage for white N9 here.]
;B[mi];W[mk];B[hk];W[gk];B[hj];W[qf];B[qe];W[nd];B[nc];W[re]
;B[qc];W[pe];B[oc];W[qd];B[rc];W[od];B[pc]C[NA-this was interesting corner play on both your parts. (that's interesting in a good way.)  This looked to me (though I'm not an expert at all) like a fairly natural joseki ("joseki" is just a word for standard sequences in the corner).]
;W[rd];B[md];W[nf];B[ne]C[NA-This is a good case to show something about go strategy.  This move is an atari.  If white doesn't reply at P15 black can take the two white stones.  I assume you are aware of this and that's why you made the move.  Let's think how much this will be worth if that happens.  It will be worth 4 points (2 for the capture + 2 for the spaces).  The problem is that if white plays basically any move extending from the upper right corner it is bound to be worth more than 4 points.  On the other hand if black were to play either an extension in the area of J17, that would be worth roughly 15 plus sente (meaning white would be well advised to reply by defending the corner).  The value is similar but perhaps larger from the other side. (ie C14 or so)]
;W[oe];B[me];W[ni]C[shiet! now i need the ko];B[oi];W[nh];B[ol]
;W[mm]C[connect or exstend?

NA- I don't really understand this question.  If it's what black should do next, I would say that it seems to me there's no reason to fight a ko over the roughly 15+ points that would be involved when you already have taken them from white and all you need to do is connect.  If you had some really awesome 30+ point move to make (remember that when you take points away from you ie captured stones, and give back points it's worth double what the point count is) it would be worth it but I don't see such a move on this board right now.]

;W[pf]C[NA-These moves are pretty unimportant compared to the huge corner still untapped.  Either of you could have jumped there and gotten a nice advantage.]
;B[rj];W[kf];B[lf];W[mc];B[ke];W[jf];B[lc];W[kd];B[mb];W[ld]
;B[jd];W[je];B[mc];W[le];B[kc]C[i thought this was nice for black but i guess white wouldn't of done it if it was not ok for him aswell i avoid the death of my stones! and im very solid on top :P

NA-This was nicely done by black.  White put themselves in an awkward position and black juices the situation for some real value.]
;W[ke];B[jc]C[NA- A better follow up move would be extending down the side either directly with J16 or maybe even a little more loosely like H17, because even if white takes the K17 stone you can connect underneath and will get more value along the edge of the board than you would by keeping this stone.]
;W[fd]C[NA-White makes a good decision to reinforce the corner but a more defensive enclosing move might have been better.]

;B[dh];W[dg];B[cg];W[be]C[this seemed stupid to me it seemed to strenthen black and die when it was played no?

NA-This move is actually pretty good.  Black is in an awful position here and has weaknesses all over the place.  This move could have ended up being a real thorn in the side of black.  The interesting thing about this corner is that it was so full of opportunity for white right up till near the end of the game and all of it was missed.  One follow up that would have been better than what happened in the game is W B17 right after black replies by taking the ko.  Blacks answer doesn't have any threat to it and B17 would secure a nice sized corner for white and black would still have to close the left side.  There were several missed opportunities like this.  I think it would be good practise to go back and try to find other points where white could have made a decision that would lead to a better position in the corner.  This review notes 2 of those but there are others.]
;B[eg];W[fe];B[ei];W[gi];B[bf];W[fi];B[eh];W[fk];B[el];W[fm]
C[NA-This move seems strange, F8 is worth one point more.  It may not seem like much but the only thing that matter (besides enjoyment of course) in go is points.  There is no sense in making a move that doesn't take a point (or more subtley: allows your opponent to take a play worth more points) when you could just as easily have taken some.]
;B[cc];W[dn];B[cn];W[gc];B[gb];W[hd];B[fb]C[loveing the ko!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[dc];B[db];W[ie]C[b 17 or c 18 bigger no?

NA-B17 is MUCH bigger.  C18 is worth nothing.  B17 is a double atari which means white will take most of the corner away from black.  If white plays C18 then black will connect at B17 and then white has no follow up.]
;B[gd];W[ii];B[bb];W[hd];B[ri]C[was this move worth more then n 1?

NA-counting such endgame moves  can get alittle tricky and are not my strongest skill, but I'll try and work through it.

I guess I would say yes because I'm not sure N1 is a good move.  It doesn't look like it would open you to be immediately killed but at the very least white P3 is a good ko threat that leads to a sequence of ko threats which is basically giving your opponent something.  If you allow white N1 the you have to play the way you did in the game but the issue is settled.  In terms of simple point difference they seem pretty equal so I think you made the right choice.]

;W[se];B[sc];W[sh];B[pi];W[fl];B[mi]C[NA-This move is kind of pointless.  After white captures the black stone they lose one point for filling in a point but they gain one by capturing the stone.  The only value this move has is if white makes a really big mistake and passes or plays somewhere else, and that's pretty bad sportsmanship on the part of black.  If the situation is genuinely complicated enough that you can't see the outcome for sure, then go ahead and play, but if the only way something could come of your move is if the opponent blunders then be respectful and don't play it.  Winning isn't worth the general decrease in friendliness that such transparent attempted trickery causes.]

NA-Thank you for the opportunity to review your game.  I hope you have learned from it.  Good luck!


PS: The best games to send in are ones you have lost by a very narrow margin (5-10 points)  those are the games that, in general, you will have the most to learn from.]
