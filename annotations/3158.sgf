C[SirJohn [8k\]: hi
SirJohn [8k\]: have fun
meet9 [8k\]: hi

Hello. I played black in this game. I have made comments on the game at 
several points.
I wanted to get this game reviewed because, as in many of my games, I don't 
manage to get the most out of a position, and sometimes turn a favourable 
position into an unfavourable one.
I also feel that I can play much better than in most of my games, and I hope 
to find the reason for that.

[DP At an overview level, the things I noticed were:
1) a tendency to attack in contact so W gets strengthened
2) worrying too much about your strong stones and playing unnecessary 
defensive moves - allows W off the hook
3) a need to consider the territory / influence (power) balance when using 
sente\]];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[do];W[cm];B[en]C[[DP The purpose of this play is to separate the W stones, so if you 
achieve that goal you should be satisfied - if you lose a couple of points 
locally it will not matter in the long term.  Think big.  Being consistent 
with the other stones you have played will count for far more than those 2 
points\]];W[cp]C[In the game I considered B C5, E3 and B6, none of which seem to give 
black a reasonable result.
In many of my games my opponent plays an odd move in the opening and I fail 
to get reasonable profit out of it.

[DP  What's the proverb?  Learn joseki and lose 2 stones in strength!  Key 
thing here is to understand the purpose behind each of these moves.
1) The approach is flawless - clearly the biggest part of the board, and the 
high approach fits with your influence based star point opening
2) The tight pincer is too aggressive since W has no strength on that side 
to back it up
3) Moving out into the centre is again consistent with B plays up to this 
point, going for influence and separating the W stones leading up to an 
attack on C7.
4) You don't need to worry about this - your original goal of separating the 
stones is still achievable, and if that wasn't your goal, you chose the 
wrong joseki! - and I don't think you did\]]
(;B[co]C[[DP
C5 is perfectly adequate to complete the separation of W
B6 is not as good for sente
E3 would have been inconsistent (see later!), and W would have been 
delighted to answer with C5

See variations\]];W[bp];B[bo]C[I felt I had to play this move to keep w seperated and for 
consistency with C5...

[DP Yes, otherwise the whole purpose of E6 would evaporate. So far this 
looks good, stones working nicely together with D16\]];W[dj]
C[[DP Oh look, a target!  E6 stones are big enough to look after 
themselves, and W has invitingly left his stones open here by extending up 
to the 4th line rather than along the 3rd.  C12 or C13 are where W would 
love to play to stabilise his group, so get there first and get the 
initiative!\]]
(;B[eq]C[[DP Wrong direction (should be attacking against your wall), and 
wrong type (contact moves are defensive).  These D5 stones, although they do 
not yet have a base, are strong and to be used for attack!  If you subscribe 
to Go World, have a look at the very first championship game there and see 
what W does with his 5 stones on the lower side\]];W[er]C[[DP and by playing contact you're now the one defending.  What did 
this gain - maybe about 10 points when you could have made 30 or so upper 
left  by attacking those two W stones against your wall\]];B[fq]
;W[fr];B[dp];W[cr];B[dl]C[[DP If I had to pick your worst move in the game, this would be a 
contender :-)

1) It is too close to thickness.  Should have been an extension from D16.
2) Strengthens W within your own area of influence.
3) It also doesn't do anything to address your weak point at G3

Much more preferable is a move like C12, expanding your territory whilst 
robbing W of his base\]];W[cl]C[[DP W says thanks very much and strengthens, vastly reducing the 
power of your wall in the meantime\]];B[dk]C[[DP You might think - but I'm building a wall for influence!  So you 
are, but the weakness at G3 (where W can hane at the head of two stones) 
means it will not count for much\]];W[ck];B[gq]C[[DP This is large, but C12 or C13 would be ENORMOUS!!\]]
;W[cf]C[[DP W has figured out the direction of play, but has gone too far. 
The cut at C10 means that C12 is about as far as he can reasonably extend\]]

(;B[ci]C[[DP Unfortunately strengthens W again by making him connect.  
Better would be D12 - see variations and compare results at move 35 in 
each\]];W[cj];B[dg];W[cg];B[df];W[ch];B[dh];W[di];B[ce];W[bi]
;B[ic]C[[DP This is too close to thickness.  You've just made a 5 stone 
wall, so K17 or K16 would be better, and L16 or L17 are also possible\]]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Should this have been on the 4th line instead?

[DP No - this feels perfect - an extension from J17 also acting as a pincer. 
  After the unfortunate exchange on the left side, B needs to look after the 
balance of territory as well - this is the best move\]];W[pb]
;B[qc]C[[DP Yes, ensure W doesn't get a base\]];W[qb]
(;B[nd]C[[DP no, no, no!  The time for this move would be if there was a 
huge moyo in the offing, but since you are open at E10 and Q10, the timing 
is wrong.

S18 takes away his eye space, forcing B into the centre.  you can then 
attack and, without actually killing, take territory on both sides. See 
variation\]];W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[kc];W[le]
(;B[oc]C[[DP Again, you are removing aji by forcing W to connect and get 
stronger.  You should be making an extension instead - see variation. An 
attempt to kill here is doomed to end in a very complicated fight!  If 
you're 6 dan and have read it out, OK, but... have a look at some of the 
variations, by no means exhaustive\]];W[ob]
(;B[lb];W[ma];B[mb];W[nb]
(;B[rb]C[Stupid blunder.

[DP Well, if you consider that you can't actually kill the W stones, then 
perhaps not so bad since it gives you sente\]];W[pc];B[od];W[rc]
;B[qd];W[ra];B[rd];W[sb];B[qi]C[[DP Hmmm.  This is tricky.  Correct extension from 6 stone wall 
would be around R8 or R9, but those two W stones at M17 have potent aji.  
May be better to attack those and in doing so take profit. To attack I'd 
probably go for something around O12, although this is subjective\]]
;W[ql]
(;B[sd]C[[DP Ah - another contender for not a very good move! You are very 
lucky that W bothers answering - it is *not* sente and W should instead have 
played something like F11. The place to hurt W now is at R3, since you have 
strength either side\]];W[sc]
(;B[oi]C[[DP Small scale again - you need something big to attack those 
stones up top - J12 for example means you will be less concerned if W does 
F11\]]
(;W[fc]C[[DP Too deep, with M15 vulnerable. Lighter move like J15 better\]]
;B[je]C[[DP Good splitting attack\]];W[lg]
(;B[ol]C[[DP Wrong direction - continue to press from K13 side to swallow up 
F17\]];W[ph]C[Here a fight started, and once more I didn't manage to get much out 
of it even though i had a better position earlier.
I think the only reason I didn't fall apart completely was that my opponent 
didn't think alot before playing...

[DP This is a good peep by W, adding very little to your position whilst 
increasing the aji from his own\]]
(;B[qh]C[[DP You should connect\]];W[og];B[qg];W[pi];B[pj]
(;W[pm]C[[DP Having pushed through, W should now take advantage and cut\]]

(;B[om]C[[DP Wrong direction again.  Defend the cut and attack W with N10\]]
;W[nh];B[oj];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[qq]C[Maybe an approach was better?

[DP No - this is fine.  You have strength on both sides so W will suffer 
here.\]];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[oq];W[on]C[[DP Oh dear.  Candidate #3 for worst move - but this time from W.  
If concerned about the centre subsequent to standard O3 hane being answered 
by a B cut at O4, W should simply extend at O4 again\]]
(;B[lk]C[[DP OK, let's have a look at this bit.  You have sente, so how to 
use it best?  You have plenty of central influence, so no real need to add 
here.  Territory is evenly balanced, but will shift massively in your favour 
if F17 dies.  This should guide you as to where to play next. So, having 
decided to attack F17, how to do it?  Take away its base, and don't play in 
contact.  Best move then D18, denying the corner and not allowing W a base.  
See variation\]];W[db]C[[DP Excellent timing by W, having done just about enough to let his 
centre group live\]];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[dc];B[bc];W[ed]C[[DP You can still attack this group even now - aim at its base with 
G18 - which at the same time strengthens your top centre group.  Your left 
stones are safe and so there is no need for E15.\]]
(;B[ee];W[fe];B[ff];W[ge]C[[DP by playing in contact you have allowed W to develop ideal shape, 
and seriously weakened your top centre stones\]];B[gf];W[gb]
C[I saw w could H15, but I didn't see how to avoid that...I won this 
game only because my opponent didn't look well enough at the game.
This dissapoints me and I know I can do better.

[DP The mistake is M9 rather than D18 back on move 89, where you missed an 
opportunity to win the game.  Stand back and use the territory / influence 
balance to guide you when you have sente\]];B[he];W[lo]C[[DP Your best bet of winning the game comfortably rests on attacking 
the W centre stones, not getting 5 extra points of territory for an already 
alive group.  Given how the stones now stand, somewhere around H11 would do 
the trick\]];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[ki]C[[DP W is spotting the danger...\]]
;B[jk];W[hh];B[lp]C[[DP Looking back on it think how that initial exchange on the left, 
leaving E11 and E10 open, has influenced the game\]];W[mo];B[jo]

;B[hk];W[el];B[fm];W[dm];B[fj];W[ek]C[[DP one last chance to attack W centre stones - F12!\]]
;B[gc];W[eb];B[gd];W[fd];B[hb];W[fa];B[fh]C[[DP OK, so you got it - now to take profit. Attack from the 
outside\]];W[ke];B[jd]C[[DP Not necessary - these stones are already connected and alive. 
Press from the outside and hurt his eyeshape - N11 would be nice and gets 
you a few points at the same time\]];W[mi]C[[DP OK, W is now alive.  That's the last of my comments\]]
