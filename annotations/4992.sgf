I would appreciate any other comments you have on any of my plays, or just the game in general.

*******Thank You for you time!*******];W[dc];B[pq];W[cn];B[gp]
C[B G4 is weak. Play simple moves. Standard Joseki would be F3. G3 would be possible even though not prefered.]
;W[iq]C[Now you see why it's weak.];B[hq];W[ip]
(;B[oo]C[Playing on the 5th line is twice nothing. Or you attack J3/4 by playing N3 or you make an enclosure with Q5 or R5. The enclosure would be quite useless because white would then extend to M3 or M4. See var.]
;W[de]C[w simply ignores and plays the shimari.]
(;B[cp]LB[pi:B][pj:C][ck:F][pk:D][cp:A][lq:E]C[this is my error!

Not really. All the points you emphasised are big points but there's really only one point to play here: K17. This would be an ideal extension from the white shimari]
;W[ck];B[qk];W[qf]C[The bot obviously doesn't know better but it attacks from the wrong side and ruins the infleunce of it's own shimari.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[jc]C[Now w plays the big point where it should have defended it's 2 heavy stones by playing R11.]
;B[cg]C[I felt at first that this was a decent invasion/reduction, but the response was anything hardly a good thing for me. Where is the money?

The money is at K15 or R12 or even M4. As a local invasion point C13 is correct but you have to consider all of the board.]
;W[eg];B[je]C[Good move];W[he]C[I'm rather confused why my opponent played this way, but it does look like he's got a large amount of territory that is on the verge of rapidly exploding.

Well it's a moyo not territory, which means that it can be invaded. W should have played H16 instead.]
;B[id]C[all i could think of at the time, this is usually always what I do when somebody plays the field

Exatcly the right move.];W[gc];B[ci]C[my opponent never really plays risky moves but, could these two stones have been killed?

It's possible but why not play J17 ?];W[qi];B[ok]C[good move.]
;W[lq]
(;B[ej]C[wrong way?

First of all you can be cut. Second B 15 is waiting for you and then you can play something like in the variation.]

;B[bg];W[be]
(;B[hg]LB[jc:4][qf:3][ck:1][iq:2]C[i kind of played the same move that my opponent did, I was just concerned about that thing growing any larger. any ideas?

Yes see variations. Or simply play J17

At this point w has three weak groups and a weak stone . The thing to do is to build territory while attacking those groups.]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ek];B[eh];W[lo];B[fk];W[el];B[qj]C[Never touch what you want to attack play P11.]

If you want to attack play something like B8 see var.];W[fl]

(;B[ph]C[Not urgent w can't kill those stones.];W[kg]C[around this time, I wasn't so much concerned killing this white group. Do you think that I am in a position to isolate and destroy  this white group?

Yes it's heavy without eyes. Instead of playing R12 you should have attacked it.]

C[Bots always play these endgame sequences quite early but w keeps sente so it's good.]

Big is L18 or P2 or even H16 or B10. All these moves are sente.]

Look for the biggest move.
Attack weak groups, not to kill but to expand your own territory.
Don't play unnecessary moves aka read it out!
Try to keep sente especially in the endgame.

Good luck and if you have any questions feel free to contact me.
