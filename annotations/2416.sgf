C[Dear Ben,
   Thanks for letting me review your game.  I am a 1kyu on IGS, so please take all of my comments with a grain of salt.  Only the professionals can say definitively what the best move is.  All of my comments are proceeded with "JM:" Feel free to contact me with any additional questions you may have.

Summary: After white saved the j5 stones, it should have been a fairly easy game for white.  However, the disaster at the top, combined with the two moves you correctly pointed out as "passes" allowed black to develop a sizable lead.  However, your comment about the endgame ko at a4 show that you also had the ability to lose a won game, although your lead was so large that in this case it didn't matter.

Some suggestions:
-Work on avoiding becoming overconcentrated in the opening.  With the defensive approach you said you prefer, this is especially a concern.
-Improve your counting.  You should not "feel" you're behind.  You should know it.
-Move away from using the sgf editor as a crutch.  This is as dangerous as using a joseki dictionary.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[oc];W[qp];B[dp];W[fq];B[fp]C[I like to settle my groups quickly. This is why I tend to make a shimari with 1 and 3 (only as Black), and why I like the joseki following Black 7.

JM: The advantage that B has in games in that they get the first move.  It may be more a matter of style, but such a defensive approach seems to give up this advantage.]

(;B[cj]C[This seemed to work well with my lower left corner.

JM: I disagree with c10.  Playing something like e14 prevents white from making the large amount of points he did in the upper left.  See the variation.]

;W[eb];B[fc];W[dk];B[el]C[Trying to kill F6.

JM: F6 is important to kill, to keep the g5/g6 stones from being weak.  At this point though, you should notice how terribly overconcentrated you are there.]
;W[dl];B[dj]C[I wanted to make D9 and D8 weak and hopefully get profit out of attacking them.

JM: Good idea.];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk];B[fl]C[At this point, I was checking out a lot of variations in an sgf editor. I wanted to make sure that F6 stayed dead.

JM: Your opponent would probably be a bit upset if he knew that.  Using an SGF editor is a crutch that you should probably try to move away from.]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[fm];W[gh];B[bl]C[Trying to take away the possibility of a White base at the same time as starting to make on for my group and threatening to connect.

JM: As you realized a few moves later, a connection is not possible.  However, this move accomplishes the correct purpose of trying to live.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[cn];B[dm];W[cl]C[At this point, I realised that I couldn't quite connect. See variations.

JM: Correct.]

(;B[cp];W[bo];B[bh];W[bg];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[fi]C[White seems to be trying to stop me from getting out, but I thought I was alive anyway. Was I?

JM: I spent a great deal of time looking at this.  It's a great life and death problem.  In my opinion, you may actually be dead, but it's quite possible I overlooked something.  See the variations starting with the next white move.]
;B[jp]C[White K5 would have been too big. I wouldn't have been happy invading after that.]

;B[pq];W[qq];B[op];W[oo];B[nq];W[pp];B[oq]C[White thought about his next move for a while, and in that time, I considered White N3, and eventually concluded that it could kill my group. Could it have? See variation.

JM: Correct]
(;B[ln];W[mq];B[lr]C[I thought I could kill the White J3 group or save the Black P3 group. Either way, I would be happy.

JM: Yes, one of these two things should have happened.];W[mr]

JM: I think they should have been.];W[hm];B[gn];W[im]C[Unexpectedly good, threatening to capture my G7 group H6. Looking back on it now, however, I can't figure out what was wrong with Black K7 as a response. Can you remind me?

JM: I don't see anything wrong with K7, it seems like the natural response.]

(;B[en];W[hn];B[eo];W[jn]C[Now I feel like I'm behind.

JM: Let's look:
White: UL 17+ LR 26 +5captures+6 komi=53
Black: LL 9+  L 7+ UL 5+ UR 20 3 capture=44

After the j5 group lived for white, you definitely needed to do something to gain some points back. But it's not out of reach at all.]

JM: Yes, these are the moves we should all be thankful for.]
;B[qj];W[jd];B[ic]C[JM: I'm not sure about j17.  Obviously you need to be concerned about the f17 group, but this move seems to be asking white to play well. This is a tough decision though.  h17 is a bit more indirect.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[je]C[I'm really trying to fight here, because I want to make up for my losses earlier. I'm hoping to kill K16.
