AB[pd][dp]C[Joey - Hi, I guess my main question is i lost this game (won only because of opponent's mistake) during the endgame, and I would like to know where went wrong.  Comments about gameplay are also appreciated.  Thanks.

csh: Obviously the upper left corner was very big. It was worth more than 30 points. However, in this review I think it is more important to emphasize the difference between strong and weak groups, especially in the opening and middle game. I will do my best to comment as we go along.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[mc];B[qf]LB[qg:A]C[csh: Usually you can extend to R13(A) because the large knight's move approach isn't a big threat against the corner.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc]
(;W[fb]LB[ca:B][fd:A]C[csh: White's play deviates from joseki. (See variation for reference.) The problem is figuring out what deviating from the joseki means for both sides.

First of all, this move does not protect the cut at F16(A). Black need not cut immediately, but the threat of that cut be a concern for White later on. Secondly, White can monkey jump to C19(B) and reduce a lot of Black's eyespace.]

(;B[kc]TR[kc]C[csh: This move is bad, mostly because of how you chose to play the upper left. It is the wrong time to pincer, after White has strengthened in the upper left. The marked black pincer stone is isolated. After White dives into the corner to create a base for his group, the black pincer stone will be weaker than the surrounding white groups.]
;W[pb];B[md]C[csh: This contact move is the right idea. It helps out the pincer stone.]
;W[ld]C[csh: However, when White hanes, it will be a hard fight.]

(;B[nd]C[csh: Black could cut instead. See the variation.];W[lc]
TR[kc]C[csh: Note that after this exchange, the marked pincer stone is not doing much for Black.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[qc]C[csh: This move is small.];W[qi]C[csh: White took advantage and pressed from the other side.]

(;B[qn]C[csh: This stone is already in trouble. Instead of approaching from this side, it might be easier for Black to approach from the other side, and leverage the support of his stone in the lower left. See the variations.]
;W[ql]C[csh: White immediately pincers, strengthening his stone on the right side, as well as attacking the black stone.]
;B[nq]LB[on:B][qq:A]C[csh: Diving into the corner and making a one-space jump are also valid options. The problem I have with the double-approach is that White is going to get a nice wall.]
;W[np];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]TR[qn]C[csh: At this point, it's obvious that White came off better in this exchange than Black did. The marked black stone is next to useless.]

(;B[lq]C[csh: Consider the hane. See the variation.];W[jq];B[gq]
C[csh: This move is good. This pincer works because the black group on the left and the one on the right are stronger than the pincered white stone.]
;W[lp]
(;B[kr]LB[mp:A]C[Joey - This seems like a small move after the game

csh: It was. I actually think that wedging at N4(A) is better. See the variation.]
;W[df];B[cf]C[csh: Even though it looks like the same shape as the joseki, Black is now a move behind.]
;W[cg];B[ce]LB[bf:A]C[Joey - Should I have played B-14 instead?

csh: It doesn't really matter. At this point, though, Black is shut in the corner. Black needs to start worrying about the life of the corner group.]
;W[dg];B[ir];W[jr];B[js];W[kq]
(;B[lr]C[csh: You can also look at protecting the cut indirectly. See the variation.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[oq];W[op]C[csh: Black has 10 points in the corner, but White has a lot more potential profit at the side of the board.]
;B[on]C[csh: At this point, it is much too late for these stones. It will be awfully difficult for this stones to live next to the white wall.]

(;W[pn]LB[ol:A]C[csh: As a side note, this is the wrong play for White. Black doesn't have enough room to live in the area, so White should just squish Black against the wall and go from there. A play at P8(A) or something would be good for White.]
;B[pm];W[po];B[qm];W[om];B[ol];W[nm];B[pl];W[pg]LB[qk:A]TR[ol]
[pl][pm][qm][qn]C[csh: It could be difficult for Black if White extends to R9(A). The marked black group would not have enough eyespace, and would have to run to the center.]
;B[nj];W[ng];B[mg];W[mh];B[nh];W[oh];B[ni];W[mf];B[lg];W[nf]
;B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[kf];B[lh];W[kg];B[qb];W[pf];B[rh];W[qg]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[qk];W[pj]C[csh: Now the white group is completely alive.]
;B[cl]C[csh: Since the groups on the righthand side of the board are all settled, an extension along the lefthand side of the board is probably the biggest move.]
;W[ee]C[Joey - I'm not sure why he made that move

csh: If nothing else, it connects up his wall. Don't underrate connections: they do help create a lot more territory when the surrounding groups are strong. For example, after this move, it will be hard for Black to invade the top of the board.

You are right, however, this was a slow move.];B[bi]LB[bg:A]
[cq:B]C[csh: This move is bad. It induces White to descend to keep the groups separated, which in turns puts more pressure on the black group in the upper left corner. It would have been much safer to push from the group at the top, like at B13(A), to get more eyespace instead.

Instead of this move, Black might consider protecting the  lower right corner from invasion, with a play at C3(B).]
;W[bg]C[csh: You need to respond to this, but you already figured that out. What you might not realize is that you "forced" him to play here, which in turn "forces" you to respond. It would have been better if you didn't play the previous move in the first place.]
;B[jj]C[Joey - I wanted to exert influence in the center, but I forgot I should protect the corner first

csh: You already figured out why you needed to protect the corner.

Unfortunately, this move doesn't exert much influence in the center. Because the white group at the bottom of the board is much stronger, adding a stone to the center black group doesn't exert much influence in the center.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[dq]
(;B[cq]C[csh: In this case, this move is actually helping White secure his group. Instead, look at surrounding him from the outside. See the variation.]

(;W[je]C[csh: White should just take, removing the bad potential in this position. See the variation.]
;B[hd];W[kb];B[gg]TR[hf][hg]C[csh: This is good strategy. Capture the cutting stones.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[gh];B[fh];W[jc];B[kh];W[dk]C[csh: This move breaks the ladder.]
;B[ek]C[csh: This move makes the ladder work again, but it doesn't really benefit Black. It might be better for Black to just take the stones.]
;W[di];B[fi]C[csh: It's better to capture the white stones, and get rid of some of White's forcing moves in the process.]
;W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[ck];W[ha];B[hl];W[hm];B[hk];W[ad]LB[ac:A]
[bd:B][ae:C][be:D][af:E][bf:F]C[Joey - Is there actually any way to save the corner group from here?

csh: It's going to be rough. As you figured out, you really needed to secure the corner earlier. Since White can make a monkey jump from both sides, life looks really hard.

Possible answers to the monkey jump are listed, but as far as I can tell, none of them work. There's not enough room in the corner for two eyes.]
;B[bd];W[ae];B[eb];W[bb];B[bc];W[ac];B[cb];W[dd]C[csh: After this move, your group is dead.]
;B[da]C[csh: Be wary of moves like this, especially if you do not see a clear way to make life. White can ignore this move. If White ignores this move, Black would have wasted a move, but the black group would still be dead.]
;W[ab];B[rj];W[ri];B[si];W[rf];B[re];W[qe];B[sf]
(;W[qf]LB[rd:A]C[csh: Interesting choice for White here. He could have played at S16(A) instead, for a nasty ko fight. See the variation.]

csh: True. Luckily White answered.];W[be];B[ho];W[rk];B[gp]
C[csh: This move is a mistake. If you decide to ignore a ko threat to end the ko, you need to make a move that will keep your opponent from retaking the ko.

Black should fill at J5 instead. The two white stones should die on their own. The surrounding black stones should have enough liberties.

Playing this move allows White to retake the ko.];W[io];B[mn]

C[csh: Actually, here Black could still connect at S17.];W[sh]
;B[sa];W[se];B[pe]C[csh: Black is already alive. The group has one eye at S17, and another at T18, so it is not urgent to play here. It gives Black one point in gote, but there are bigger plays elsewhere.]

[ps][qs]C[csh: This game was played well by both sides.

Probably the most improvement can be gained from spending more time looking at the relative strengths of groups in the opening and middle game. Weak groups need attention to make sure they do not die, and strong groups can be used to attack the other player's weak groups. At this stage, more can be gained from a better understanding of the earlier stages, making "comebacks" in the late endgame unnecessary.]
