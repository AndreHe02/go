AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[This is a game I (mgriffin) played on KGS.  I have been away from the game for a while, so I'm kind of rusty.
During this game, I felt as if I was being forced the entire time.  I must have made moves which did not attack my opponent severly enough, or I did not understand how to follow up my moves.  Some general tips on how I might play better would be appreciated.  Thanks.

benni: I am a 2nd kyu frrom germany and hope i can make some helpfull comments.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[I began with standard, defensive, opening moves.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[ic];B[kc];W[fc];B[df]LB[ec:A][fd:B]C[d14 is not so good. Black is on the 4th line at both corners at the left side. White has a forceful attack (see variation).   b c14 is better. or  play bA - wB to overconcentrate white first.]

(;W[db]C[Now white has a secure base and black is still open in the left.]
;B[cc];W[qn];B[mp]C[Here again. Better to play on the 3th line to weaken the lone white stone in the bottom left and make territory with the same move. If you play on the 4th line, if w is allready on the 3th line, you cant forceful attack white..]
;W[pj]C[Here I decided that I should reduce his territory on the right side, and I used a capping play to see how he would respond.]
;B[nj]LB[ql:A][qh:B][jq:C]C[Again, not so good. White has two weak points at A and B and there is no territory in the moment. Better to play around C. Your O10 strengthens white weak position in the right and gains not much in exchange.]
;W[qj];B[ol];W[pm];B[om];W[on]C[I wasn't very aggressive here, and I had my center group get squeezed into a bad shape.  Perhaps a play here at N7 could have avoided it.

benni: Not really. The error was before. You cant expect a wall here after you strengthen white that much.]
;B[nn];W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[mn];W[mo];B[ln];W[lo];B[lp];W[ko]
;B[jq];W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[br];B[eq];W[dr];B[fp];W[er]
;B[gp];W[ep];B[eo];W[gq];B[hp];W[kn]C[I felt this was an extremely bad move for me.  If I could have built a solid wall facing the center, I feel I would have won easily.]
;B[ll];W[cl]C[I still am not sure what would have been a good move against this.  I know I had the lone white stone easily overpowered, so I attacked it while building center influence.]
;B[ci]LB[cj:A]C[maybe at A instead. you are strong there, no need to keep away.]
;W[bn];B[bq]LB[bo:A]C[Maybe better at A, so you take possible eyespace away while inhibit the connection.]
;W[el];B[ej]LB[gl:A]C[this makes it to easy for white to escape. Better capping at A.]
;W[gl];B[gj];W[im]C[you dont gain much from this attack.];B[ie]
;W[jd]LB[fe:A]C[i had played at A to destroy your moyo there. But it is maybe a matter of taste.]

[bk:E]C[it is very important to look for sente moves to play instead of such passive moves in the endgame.  A- F are all sente. You can play them first and than still answer ar J10.]
;W[ba];B[ac];W[kj];B[mj];W[le]C[I responded very passively against all of these invading moves, and I don't know how I could have played better.

See the last comment. Just play you one sente moves first. Localy M16 is better.]

Thats normal. It happens to me, too ;-)
... but in this case, i think white O2 is an overplay.];B[mr]
C[correct answer.];W[or]

benni: Dont strengthen week positions, if it is not necessary and dont answer automatically at every move at the endgame. This should gain you much strength.]
