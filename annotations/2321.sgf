C[Please review for the black side. I entered some questions at a few moves where i was not sure how to proceed. Please feel free to comment on other moves as well and point out mistakes.
Thank you];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[kc];W[cj];B[pk]
;W[mp];B[po];W[jq];B[pe]C[LoP: I felt it's nice to defend in this corner, although it's a little slow maybe.]
;W[hc];B[id]LB[cc:A][fc:B][hd:C]C[reid: J16 is a significant problem.  I have a friend here at the local go club who has this same bad habit:   Of course, black intends to invade at A next, so he thinks to get the most from his sacrifice stone at B.  We tell my friend that this kind of move is thinking along the lines of "first, I'll make him strong, then I'll invade".  The invade idea is OK, but you *must* drop the "first I'll make him strong" part.

Here white naturally responds with C.  But the exchange of J16 for C is terrible aji-keshi.  Before this exchange, black's stone at C has all kinds of aji that could be used in different ways.  But after white C, it's all gone.  And black J16 doesn't even get anything significant for black that L17 doesn't already do.  The exchange of black J16 for white C is hugely in white's favor.]
;W[hd];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cd]LB[eb:A][nd:B]C[reid: Whoops!  white is looking for trouble here! Consistency demands white A instead of C16.  Later, white can look forward to the invasion/attack somewhere around B.]
;B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[bd];B[gb]C[reid: But now black gives white another chance.]
;W[hb]LB[eb:B][ec:A][fd:C]C[reid: which white fails to take.  If white A, black B, white C, then black's position is miserable and white has nothing to worry about.

Instead of G18, black should have done something to keep white split - perhaps A, for example.]
;B[fe]C[reid: now white has to struggle for life which will help make the K17 stone stronger, naturally increasing black's moyo.  And F15 makes a huge reduction in white's moyo (compared to what it could have been).]
;W[ie];B[ec]LB[gd:A][jd:B][gf:C]C[LoP: connecting F15

reid, yes, but can't black make his connection in a more positive way?  For example, black A is a sollid connection that also takes a liberty from the three white stones, or C is a ligher move that attacks H16 better and also looks towards reducing the moyo faster (at the risk of perhaps losing some stones).]
;W[gf];B[ff];W[fg];B[ej]LB[ge:C][ef:B][eg:A]C[LoP: Here i was not sure how to play. I thought cutting immediately at E13 will not be good so i thought i'll cap and if white D8 i invade at C3.

reid: It's almost always better to play from your established stones rather than to launch a new invasion like this.  Here we have one lonely black stone swimming in a white ocean.  True, the white stones are far away (most of them), but it's clear that without support, this black stone faces an uphill battle.  White should get the better of any fight here.

How about this instead:  black A to see how white answers?  If white tries to cut at B, black C puts him in a bind: there is a double atari somewhere in white's future, or he can chosse to give up the three H16 stones on a large scale.

If white doesn't cut at B, black of course connects and gets to wander around in what white was hoping to be territory.]
;W[gg]LB[eg:A]C[reid: perhaps A would be a bit better for white.  It leaves less aji for black (making the E10 stone suffer more).  A black cut at G13 is not too threatening as white can easily live on both sides.]
;B[cq]C[LoP: Maybe D8 better?

reid: Too many groups!  You cannot win at go by taking away your opponents territory.  You have to make your own territory, too.

White gets to choose how to attack these weak stones to get the most effective result.]
;W[cp]C[reid:  Given the G13 wall, this looks like the right direction.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]LB[fq:A]C[reid: hmmm, white invites a black position between E3 and K3 as opposed to confining black to the corner.  Is that really what he wants?  I think A is better for white.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[gr]LB[bo:H][bp:A][bq:D][br:F][cr:E][dr:B][cs:G]
[fs:C]C[LoP: I thought having a ponnuki on this side is nice for a future attack on K3. I felt playing the ponnuki at B4 is not so good.

reid: B4?  That would be pretty much a disaster for black. Observe A through H - black gets almost nothing.]
;W[dr]LB[fp:A][gq:B][fs:C]C[reid:  Not consistant for white.  Continuing with A looks like what white wants.  If black B, white can still play D2.  If instead black C, white B leads to nicely placed thickness for white.]
;B[fs];W[cr];B[fp];W[qp]C[reid: White let a nice position slip away.  Now plays around B and C are sente for black, so the E10 stone is much relieved.]
;B[pp];W[hq];B[bq]C[LoP: Is it better to just hane at E5? I thought adding some stones here first shouldn't hurt.]
;W[br];B[bp];W[bo];B[eo];W[dn];B[do]LB[dm:B][en:A][co:C]C[LoP: I think just E6 is better.

reid: Yes, A (E6) is *much* better.  White must respond white B because of the aji at C.  This just burns a black liberty to no good purpose.]
;W[co];B[fo]C[LoP: Here i should push at e6. This move allowed white to make a lot on the left side. I think this is the mistake that decided the game.

reid: E6 is not without its danger, too.  What if white cuts directly?  The F3 group is in imminent danger.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[el]LB[ck:G][ek:C][gk:F][cl:H][dl:B][fl:A][gm:D]
[fn:E]C[reid: why is white afraid of the hane here?  If black cuts at E8 (after white A), white B , black C, through white F and it looks like black is in serious trouble (if later black G, white H keeps it simple).]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gk];W[ek];B[hl];W[gn];B[fn]C[reid: Black came out of this smelling like a rose, I think.]
;W[mn];B[qo]LB[lo:A][mo:B][lq:C][mq:D]C[LoP: I felt that i need to remove the aji because white aims at Q7

reid:  Hmm, I think you should learn to cultivate the feeling that taking territory in gote is painful.

I feel that the three black stones (Q4) are quite strong here, as is the black wall at G5.  I want to attack the 5 stones inside these formations.  C looks like a nice weak spot to poke at, but if white answers at D, it looks like black has some trouble.  So let's try a probe at A first.  If white responds with B, then after white C, black D is not really possible.  (Actually, black can play C direclty, but the readout is a bit long - see variation).

By attacking these stones, black may get an extra stone or two around B which would make R5 unnecessary.  If the attack fizzles out for any reason, black can always go back and take the gote territory if he really needs it.]

(;W[hr]LB[lo:B][lq:A][nq:C][or:D]C[reid: This doesn't address the weak point at A (now black *must* use the probe at B first).

Maybe white should play C instead (leaving D as a big double-sente yose).]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[md]LB[kp:C][kr:B][lr:A]C[reid:  Black fails to keep up the attack!  When your opponent is on the ropes, squeeze him for all it's worth.  How about black A, white B, black C for starters?

N16 is another "territory in gote" move.];W[or];B[nq];W[qi]
;B[qj];W[oi];B[ri];W[qh];B[nk]LB[qh:B][ri:A]C[reid:  Black needs to make up his mind here.  Does he want to split white and attack?  or does he want to go for territory?  If he wants to attack, then helping white get stronger with the A, B exchange is a mistake.  Somewhat similar to the "first I'll make him stronger, then I'll invade" fallacy.]
;W[ol]C[reid Now white wants to help black attack him.];B[ok]
;W[on];B[mi]C[reid: Yes!];W[nf];B[ne]C[reid: No!

Does black want to attack?  or does he want territory?];W[rh]
;B[rj]LB[si:B][rk:A]C[reid: A would be more like a connection towards the R5 stone (and B won't help white make eyes).]
;W[re];B[rd];W[mg];B[qm]LB[nh:C][no:B][np:A]C[LoP: Maybe O4 instead?
reid: Not O4 (A), but O5 (B)!  O12 (C) also looke interesting, although it's probably too late for a kill here.

But R7 is certainly too slow.];W[oq];B[pr]LB[no:A]C[reid:  It's still not too late for A (O5).]
;W[op];B[os];W[ns];B[ps];W[nr];B[eg]C[LoP: I was behind so i started to try a little]
;W[ef];B[fj];W[gj];B[cn];W[bn];B[of]C[reid: Black's last three moves added maybe fie or ten points to white's score.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[oh];B[kh];W[lf];B[hj];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh];B[lm]
LB[jg:A]C[reid:  Another "territory in gote" move.  Black should keep attacking the P12 group to try to solidfy his strength around A.  Then, when there's no more attacking to do, come back and take the big gote point.]
;W[ii];B[jg];W[ij];B[hk]LB[ke:A]C[reid:  Black missed his chance to enclose white with A.]
;W[me];B[ld];W[od];B[nd];W[lh];B[li];W[jh];B[ji];W[ih]LB[kf:A]
C[reid: Black A can still enclose (sort of).  If black exchanges B for C first, A looks like a ko for white to live.

This game was characterised by a lack of consistency from both players.  There was also a lot of aji-keshi, and a fair number of reading mistakes.  Both players should work on all these elements to see improvements in their games.
