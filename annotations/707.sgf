[ic:d][id:e]C[Up to here the opening is fine, but this move is a mistake. There's a proverb that says "Attack from a distance, defend close up", and this move disobeys it. White's stone is a little weak (though not very) because it's outnumbered three to one in the top half of the board. You should be use this weakness to make some profit, e.g. by playing 'a' (M17), which is an extension from your top right corner and threatens to prevent White making any sort of base. If White responds by extending to 'b' (G17), you could then play something like 'c' (D14) to build up your left hand side.

By playing in contact with White's stone you weaken that stone, but you also leave your own stone weak. I've shown a couple of ways that White could take advantage of this: by playing at 'd' (J17) or 'e' (J16) - see the two variations.]

(;W[lc]C[A slight mistake, as this move doesn't affect the liberties of either the White or Black stone.]
;B[ic]C[Good, now all your stones have at least three liberties and White is down to two. In close-quarter fighting like this, liberties are very important.]
;W[kd];B[je]LB[id:a][jb:b][kc:c][fh:d][hd:e]C[Preventing White from cutting at 'a' (J16) is a good idea but it would be better to do it more solidly, by playing 'a' yourself. Your move looks like it does more to help build up your position in the top left quarter, but it has a problem: if White cuts at 'a' you're relying on a ladder to capture the White stone. If White plays a ladder breaker, say at 'd' (F12), and you protect the cut with 'e' (H16) then White gets a move head start on invading your top left.

What I would do in this position is to play the atari at 'b' (K18) - if White connects at 'c' (L17) I'd connect at 'a'. If White didn't connect then I wouldn't need to either, because I can capture the K17 stone to connect all my stones together.]
;W[oc];B[nc]LB[pe:a]C[This is a similar problem to the move at K16: you're playing contact moves in an attempt to attack a group, but the likely result of such moves is that you end up strengthening the group without gaining much. Better to play something simple, like 'a' (Q15), which strengthns your position in the corner, makes some territory and leaves some possibility of attacking the White group later.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[mc];B[jb];W[kc];B[pd];W[kb];B[ib];W[pb];B[qb]
;W[nb];B[jh]LB[hd:a][qg:b]C[This still leaves White the chance to play ladder breakers while invading your area in the top left - 'a' (H16) would prevent this. Also, a move such as 'b' (R13) on the right is big - if White gets a move in around there your top right group could become weak, and White will be able to make territory on the right by attacking it. 'b' prevents this and makes you some territory.]
;W[jq];B[qg]C[Good move.];W[cm];B[dm]LB[dl:a]C[This is consistent with the way you've been building up a framework around the top left corner and extending into the centre - it works will with the stones at K12, K15, K14 and D10. Things could get interesting if White answers at 'a' (D8) - I've tried to show some of the possibilities in the variation.]

(;W[dn];B[en]LB[dl:a][em:b]C[Pushing your luck a bit here, leaving White the atari at 'a' (D8). Better to play the solid move at 'b' (E7), which builds up your centre nicely.]
;W[do];B[el]LB[cl:a][ek:b][cj:c][bj:d][dl:e]C[Now White can play 'a' (C8), threatening to cut off your stones with 'b' (E9) or to slide into your territory with 'd' (B10).  Playing 'e' D8) might be the best option here.]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[dl];B[em];W[bk];B[bj]LB[dk:a][ek:b][ej:c][fk:d]
C[I'd be more worried about White cutting with White 'a' (D9), Black 'b' (E9), White 'c' (E10). To prevent this, I'd play 'a' myself and then 'd' (F9) after White connects.]
;W[aj]C[A bit early to play this, as it strengthens your top left and makes it more difficult to invade.]
;B[ai];W[ak];B[bi];W[qk];B[qj]LB[qi:a]C[This is another inappropriate contact move. It's likely to provoke White into strengthening his stones here, making it more difficult for you to do anything in the bottom right later.

You don't really need a move here at all, but if you want to play here, 'a' (R11) is a better option.]
;W[rj];B[qi]C[Notice that you had to play a defensive move here because your R10 stone was short of liberties. This is the sort of problem that you get with contact moves.]
;W[pk];B[kl]C[A good multi-purpose move, building up your framework even further and moving in to White's potential territory in the bottom right.]
;W[ln]C[Now the game becomes a contest of your top left against White's bottom right. Your area is bigger, but that also means it's easier to invade, so you still have to be careful.]
;B[nm]LB[ml:a][mm:b][nl:c]C[If White plays 'a' (N8), it doesn't look like this stone can escape, but it might be possible to sacrifice it  - see the variation. 'b' or 'c' (N7 or O8) would be safer.]

(;W[nn]LB[om:a][ml:b]C[You could answer this simply by moving further into White's territory with 'a' (O7) - after that, White can't cut you off with 'b' (N8) any more (see the variation).]

;B[fo];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fn]LB[ek:a]C[Playing 'a' (E9) would protect both cutting points.]
;W[in];B[im];W[hm];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[jk]

(;W[hl]LB[ik:a]C[This is a 'thank you' move by White because it forces you to connect at 'a' (J9), which you wanted to do anyway. It would be much better for White to leave the possibility of cutting at 'a' to help an invasion of your top left - see the variation on the previous move for the sort of thing that White could aim at.]
;B[ik];W[fk];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej]C[White has now forced you to fix most of your important weaknesses.]
;W[sg];B[sh];W[rh];B[ri]
(;W[rk]LB[si:a]C[White can capture at 'a' - see the variation on the previous move.]
;B[si];W[nj];B[nk];W[oj];B[rg];W[lk];B[jn];W[jo];B[km]LB[ko:a]
C[Note that if you play at 'a' (L5), White can't cut you off - see the variation.]

;W[mn];B[mk];W[of];B[pf];W[og];B[qq]C[In contrast to the other contact plays I mentioned, this is a good example of how to use them. You're playing in an area where White is already strong, so if the result of the fight is that both sides become strong then White hasn't gained much and you've gained a lot.

White could almost certainly kill this stone, but the way you play creates the chance for White to make a mistake.]
;W[pq];B[rp]C[Good follow-up: create as many weaknesses as possible in the White position and don't spend moves fixing your own - you don't have time to do that in this position.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[ro];B[pp]C[More good moves...];W[sp];B[oq]LB[qo:a]
C[I'd like to play the atari at 'a' (R4) first - if White tries to fight the ko then that's fine - this area should all have been WHite territory anyway, so you're not risking much. If, on the other hand, White connects, having the extra stone at 'a' might come in useful.]
;W[op];B[pr];W[po]LB[nr:a]C[If White had played this at 'a' (O2), it would still be difficult for you to live.]
;B[np];W[pq];B[nr];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[pp];W[oo];B[mp]LB[os:a]
C[This is greedy - if White plays 'a' (P1) now, you don't have two eyes. Just play 'a' yourself and be satisfied with having trashed half of White's largest territory.

See the variation for White playing at 'a'.]

;B[lc];W[fc]LB[gc:a]C[... White can safely extend to F17 instead of 'a' (G17).This gives White a couple of extra points of territory on the top edge, puts more pressure on your corner stone (because the White stone is a point closer) and, most importantly, strengthens the White group by giving it extra space for eyes and more liberties.
