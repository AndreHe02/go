C[Hi Ranppa.  Hope my comments help.  ^_^];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp]
;W[pd]C[I would probably have played in the bottom-left corner first as the corner is not yet secure.  Try to secure the corners first - and from these corners attempt to move towards the side.

I'll indicate a few ways to enclose the corner.  A few other fuseki patterns you can consider is also shown - although the opponent wouldn't necessarily allow you to play them...]

White's move at R17 isn't really a standard response so there isn't really any joseki here.

It does protect from a 3-3 invasion and in this case secure the corner, but so also does R16 and S16 - which in this case might have been stronger moves in the direction of black.

Still...this is a very submissive and small move.  It secures the corner but doesn't really create influence or potential territory outside the corner.

I think black should just continue making big moves to punish this small move by white.  The white player probably played to prevent the 3-3 invasion - but a 3-3 invasion at this point would have been GOOD for white.  Black would gain only about 9 points while black gains quite a lot of influence.]

Seems good.  Black will have to move inside your moyo (potential territory) soon - and then he will be surrounded by black on all the sides of the board.  Still I think white can still easily live so its difficult how the game would progress from here.]

Good move.  White will still get some eye space but black is building big moyos on both sides.]
;W[gp];B[ep]C[This looks very good for black.  Shimari with an extension and potential moyo on the side.]
;W[fq]C[Black should maybe attempt to build his moyos even if it means sacrificing the corner.]

(;B[fp]C[Doesn't really keep black from the corner.  And doesn't really threaten anything.  I think the moves up to here were all very good, but this move seems gote and unthreatening.]

(;B[er]C[Doesn't work very well, maybe rather D2 to keep black from the corner.  I think D2, though seeming passive, works out better than the continuation in the game, and the one showed hereafter.]

You still have bad aji (potential) at E3 and weak shape on the right hand side so I think white will easily be able to live.

Think in terms of the territory game > Even if white lives then at least you must get something worth while - like a big moyo on the right hand side.  Or stated differently - focus on your own game and only attack when there is a real obvious weakness (especially against stronger players)

In this position white's position seems strong while black still has ample aji and bad shape.]

Good strategy but white has quite a lot of territory on the bottom - and is still connected to the outside, and quite a large moyo of his own.  I will try to attack his weak stone at C12 and in the process try and build up the moyo in other more aggressive ways first.]

You might still have tried something at the top by invading on the third line.  Still white doesn't really have too much aji to manipulate, and there are no adjacent black structures to threaten to connect to (and thereby make white block, letting black live in his next move)...so I doubt anything could still have been done from this position.

I think there were quite a few cases of tactical errors and bad shape, but I think that if you focus on strategy first then you would be able to focus on tactical positions from a more relaxed position.

> Make big moves, but get to know the difference between big moves and urgent moves.

I think especially if you made big moves then this game could potentially have been quite a struggle for white - with a potential big moyo on the left and right as indicated in the comments.

Good luck with your game!  Hope my comments helped :)

O yes, you also asked about how to learn GO.  Check out the following blog entry from someone elses blog

http://www.livejournal.com/users/falling_stones/19488.html

Just play and do life and death.  I think if you even just worked through 50 easy life and death problems the improvement in reading skill would really improve your game tremendously.  Also after a few more games you will automatically start to recognize some basic bad shapes.

Good luck with your game!  :)
