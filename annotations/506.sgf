C[Hi namico,

Thank you very much for the chance to review your game. I hope my comments and remarks will help you to improve your playing.

Please understand that my comments are only suggestions. I am a 6k* on IGS (4k* on NNGS, 1k in Europe). So my knowledge about Go is far from perfection. But still I hope my comments and remarks will help you to improve your playing.

In order to view and understand my game comments correctly I ask you to active the "Show next move" option in your sgf editor. (If you use WinMGT you can find this feature in "Options/Set Up" on the "Board" tab).

If your viewer is set that way, you should see an "A" at coordinate Q4, which is the next move. When I refer to 'a', I mean the next move to be played. When I refer to 'b' or 'c' I refer to other possible moves I have marked. If there is a variation connected with them I will write 'See variation.' Also, I refer to black as B and white as W.   You hereby have permission to use and publish this game record with my comments in whatever form you need as long as this form is non-profit for you or any other person or legal entity.

Lithuania];B[pp]C[Some overall remarks about this game:

1. Play urgent moves before big moves.

Sometimes one of your groups is not settled. It may not be alive yet, or in danger to be cut off from other stones. Or sometimes there is a situation which is left unfinished, leaving too many options or some advantage for your opponent if he plays there next.  In these cases making a further move there is urgent and should be done before playing anywhere else, even if there are big points in some other part of the board.

I indicated several of these situations in your game. Please study them.

2. Don't play moves without purpose or need

There are some moves which do not give you anything, nor points nor do they help some endangered groups or attack your opponent's groups.   Learn to avoid making such moves. Train yourself to read ahead and see what a move results in and to find out if a move has some purpose or not.

3. Study tesuji and Life & Death problems

What you need most is some reading skills. Improving your ability of reading ahead a couple of moves and finding the best move for the given situation should boost your playing strength significantly.   I would recommend you to get some books like 'Tesuji' or vol. 2 or 3 from the 'Graded Go Problems For Beginners'. Spend some time with them, and you'll see your strength going up several stones in a very short time.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[cd]C[C16 is a small mistake by W. The usual move would be at D17 or D16. Here, the W stone's direction is across the top, facing the B nirensei formation on the right side (nirensei = two stones on starpoints).   Playing at 'a' is already taking advantage of W's small blunder because it is played in the above-mentioned direction.  But B can do even better by playing at 'b'. See variation.

Remark:  Please understand that in most cases there are no real mistakes or blunders in the opening stage of the game. A move in the opening which is called a 'mistake' must be understood as 'playing moves which are not 100 % efficient'. It is the opponent's task to take advantage of this inefficiency, and this is very often not easy to do.]

(;B[jd];W[nc]TR[jd]C[Playing 'a' is not bad. But B can do better by putting his marked stone to better use. See variation 'b'.]

(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[nd];W[mc];B[md];W[ld]C[.];B[le]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[jc];B[kc];W[lc];B[ic];W[jb];B[je]C[Although it may look like this fight came out in favor for W, B can actually be quite satisfied with the result.

B built a beautiful wall facing downwards. The value of this wall outweights by far the profit which W gained at the top right. B can use this wall best if he gets the chance to play around 'b', creating a large-scale framework.

B should also play 'c' as soon as possible to eliminate in sente a potential weakness in his wall. See variation.]

(;W[id]TR[jc][jb]C[B should play 'b' first, threatening to capture W's marked stones and then capture W's cutting stone of J16 in a ladder. See variation.]

(;B[ec]TR[id]C[E17 is no good. I understand that B was afraid of W playing there himself and making a corner enclosure. But catching W's marked cutting stone is more important here. See comments in previous variation.

Also B's E17 stone is lonely and weak and can become the target of a severe attack.]
;W[hc];B[ie];W[hd]TR[ec]C[It is now urgent for B to care about the fate of his marked stone, probably by jumping out with 'b'.  If W catches this stone, he will get a huge profit at the top and the upper left corner.

It is not much use to play at 'a' here.  B's wall along the 15-th line is already very impressive and dominates with its influence the whole center.  Instead of extending his wall with 'a' B has to play first a move at the bottom to develop his framework in a better, box-like shape.]

(;B[he];W[ee];B[fe];W[dc];B[fd];W[ed];B[fc]TR[ec]C[B managed to save his marked stone. But W took huge profit in the upper left.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[mf];B[pj]C[A good idea.];W[qn]TR[mf][me]C[R6 by W creates another weak group in B's sphere of influence. See variation 'b' how B can exploit this.

Playing 'c' or O4 is also possible. In the result, you will force W to create another small weak group which he will have to worry about later, and build some potential territory on the bottom.

Ignoring W's approach move of R6 and playing elsewhere is definitely not advisable. 'a' is big but answering W's approach move is urgent, and therefore should be played.]

(;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[nq]C[In this situation, I would play at 'b'. Attaching at 'a' only forces W to strengthen his stone.]

(;B[np];W[mq];B[jq];W[qq]C[B should finish the fight in the lower right corner before switching elsewhere. This is urgent.

Blocking at 'c' would be the right idea here. See variation.

The block on the other side - at 'b' - would be wrong. See variation.]

(;B[cn];W[cp]C['a' should be played only if you expect to build something bigger on this side. But W is already strong in the upper and lower left corners. This wide extension gives W a good opportunity to invade and divide B's stones.

By playing at 'b' B  would create a stable group which will be very difficult to kill. This result would be enough for B from a strategical point of view. The left side is W's sphere of influence. He played his first two moves there claiming this side for himself. Establishing there a stable black group is enough harm to W.]

(;B[dj];W[en];B[dl]C[Like mentioned in the last comment it is more important to stabilize your group on the left side. That's why a move on the third line, e.g. C8 might be better here.]
;W[qp]C[Now B gets punished for leaving this corner unfinished.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[qo];B[lp];W[mp];B[mo];W[op];B[no];W[pq]
;B[oo];W[lq]C[B can play at 'b'. If W cuts at M5, the ladder will be in favor for B.

Playing 'a' lets W walk into your bottom territory and divides your groups anyway.]

(;B[ko];W[kp];B[lo];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hq];W[in]C[This is a big success for W. B's groups are divided into small chunks which have to struggle for life.]
;B[fn];W[em];B[dh]C[Play third line to stabilize your group! Here, W can still walk in with a move like B12 and make trouble.]
;W[nm];B[ql]C[A good move. A forcing move which builds some territory on the side.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[qj];W[qm]TR[mf][me]C['a' is certainly a small endgame move worth only several points. It is also not urgent because your right side is not under attack. So B has time to look for a big move...

At this moment, B has sente. He can choose where to play next. When looking at the whole board, one can see that all corner and side territory are mostly settled. But the center is still an open question.   Especially interesting for B is to try to catch W's two marked stones, e.g. with a move like 'b' which tries to catch these stones on a large scale.

Another big point - maybe even bigger - is to run away with the O5 group with a move like 'c'.]

(;B[rl]TR[me][mf];W[nj]C[W is trying to link up his stones. The opportunity for B to get something in the center is gone. The only option now for B is to run away with his O5 group.]
;B[oh];W[mh];B[gg]C[Sorry for the harsh words. But this move serves no purpose. It doesn't create eyes for the group at the top, nor link it up with some other group.]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[eh];W[cg];B[ch]TR[dh]C[If B had played his marked stone at C12 earlier he could now defend against the cut of F12.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[fh]C[Playing at 'b' would catch W's stone. See variation.]

(;B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl]C[By pushing W along like this, B gained nothing. His groups are divided and therefore weaker, no territory was made.  Although B built some strong groups in the top center, he will not get much territory from them because the few, very efficiently placed W stones eliminate B's potential in the center.]
;W[il]C['a' is not urgent because the left side group is safe. B has to care about his top center and bottom group which are in danger. This is most urgent. He could do that by playing at 'b' which links together both groups after which W will not be able to kill them.]

(;B[dm];W[fm];B[el]C[This move does not give anything. If you want to enlarge your territory on the left side, playing at 'b' would be the right move.

'b' is also sente against W because it threatens that B enters the corner with B3.

On the other hand, the left-side group is rather safe now. So B should better care for his other groups, e.g. at the bottom.]

(;W[gn];B[fo];W[gm]C[Better take some territory in the center with a move around  K12.]
;B[ik];W[dn];B[cm]C[Again, B5 is better here.];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl]
;B[kk];W[ll];B[lk]C[This is basically the same mistake like B did with his G10 group. He is pushing W along without building anything, only strengthening W's group.

Playing around L12 instead of M9 would give B some center territory here.]
;W[ki];B[li];W[lh];B[lf];W[lg];B[kg];W[kh];B[lj]C[Saving the M11 stone is small and not urgent. It would be urgent to play at 'a' instead to make some eyes for the center group.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ig]C[W is freely walking into what should have become territory for B.

Although, W is careless here and should be punished with 'b'. See variation.]

(;B[hh];W[gd];B[ge];W[nh];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj];W[hl];B[hk];W[hj]
;B[ih];W[eb];B[nf]C[B's group has only one eye. To save his group, B could play K12 and start a ko fight.   To win a ko fight, you need more threats than your opponent. O14 would be an excellent ko threat. That's why B should not waste it now.]
;W[mg];B[jh];W[kf]C[Now, O14 would have been very useful.

Instead of 'a', B should try 'b'. See variation.]

;B[hp];W[go];B[kq];W[jn];B[lr];W[mr]C['a' is the wrong move in this situation. 'b' would be the best try but still it won't make B's group alive. See variation.]

;W[oi];B[pi];W[rm];B[og];W[rc];B[rd];W[sc]C[You need to play 'b' here. It is the right order of moves. Otherwise, W will play 'b' which will cost you 2 points. See variation.]

(;B[qd]C[W should play 'b'.]
(;W[rb];B[sd];W[bo];B[bn];W[an];B[am];W[ao]C[B should play 'b' instead of 'a'. See variation.]

;W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[bk];W[ck]C[Playing 'b' makes life for your group. See variation.]

(;B[al];W[ak];B[cl];W[cj];B[bk];W[aj];B[ci];W[ei]C[B can still win this fight unconditionally by playing at 'b'. See variation.]

;B[ai];W[bi];B[dk];W[bl];B[ag];W[af];B[bk]C[W has no big threat which he could use in this ko fight.
