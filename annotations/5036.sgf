C[This game is very short so please include many varitions tyvm!
_______________________________________
[eversonyoshi\]: Hi, ok! =D];B[pd]C[Skullfire [16k\]: gl 2 u too
______________________________________
[eversonyoshi\]: Hoshi (4-4) is good to create influence and to play offensive. Like Master Go Seigen said in a interview, Hoshi is faster than 3-3 or 3-4.

  It is good to learn how to play 4-4 because it is played a lot in even games and you will face 4-4 in handicap games (you will play with it or against it...).

  I don't know what you know, then please, forgive me if I say elementary things... ^_^]

(;W[cp]LB[eq:E3]TR[ep][fp][fq]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Komoku (3-4) isn't so fast as 4-4, but it usually gives you secure territory. It is slower because you will need another play to enclosure the corner, like E3. It is called Shimari.

  While 4-4 is a symmetric move, 3-4 isn't. When you play 3-4, you already know (more or less) where the oponent will attack. This attack against a corner stone is called Kakari. And usually is played in E3 or in one of the triangles points.

  Why am I talking about it? Because White played a Hoshi after 3-4, so in my opinion, it would be better to play Hoshi now, because playing 3-4 he lets you choose  the kind of the beginning... It is not a mistake, it is just a little detail... See variants...]
;B[pq]LB[pq:Q3][cp:C4]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I liked Q3 because it already prepares to attack C4. It is also the beginning of a famous Fuseki called Chinese Opening. Fuseki is the name of the beginning of the game and it is regarded as the most difficult part.]
;W[dd]LB[pq:Q3][pd:Q16][dd:D16][cp:C4]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I am watching Lee Changho games and  I am seeing this fuseki a lot (D16 and C4). I don't understand what is behind each Fuseki, but I prefer yours (Q16 and Q3), but these two formations are right and are very used. So, until now, everything is ok.]

(;B[eq]LB[pq:Q3][eq:E3]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You were worried with this move, but there is nothing wrong with it. It is a Kakari. 

   Kakari and Shimari usually has the same value. And E3 is "working together with Q3", because both are almost taking the lower side, and if White plays a stone between E3 and Q3, this stone will be already surrounded and can be severe attacked.

  See the variants for others examples.];W[pp]LB[eq:E3]C[Skullfire [16k\]: wow
Skullfire [16k\]: this is diffrent ^^
I think i should have closed off my corner before approaching my oppents.... And I haven't seen this played out before so if you could show me some diffrent play out of the attachment attack against the corners i wuold be most appreciative...
_________________________________________
[eversonyoshi\]: Like I said, your Kakari in E3 isn't wrong.

You are right about White's move, this is not common. In japanese, attachment is known as Tsuke. I use Kogo's Joseki Dictionary (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm) and it isn't there because it is wrong or maybe not common.

I played these "Tsuke Josekis" in my Go Clube for a time, but I stopped because they hated this... (maybe because they had to read more and be more careful...). But I learned that two things can happen after a Tsuke:
1) One extends connecting (Nobi) and the two sides become strong;
2) One side makes Hane, the other makes a Cross-Cut and a Semeai begins;

 I will explain this in variants in the next move...]
(;B[op]LB[op:P4][qp:R4][oq:P3][qq:R3][po:Q5]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I forgot to tell you that some players do this kind of move aiming to confuse the other player.

P4 and R4 are the most common to me. It follows the second option that I said. As you played P4, I will put variant with R4.

P3 and R3 are the fist option that I said.

Q5 is a crazy and complex idea that came in my mind...];W[oq]

;B[pi]LB[pg:Q13][qg:R13][qh:R12][ph:Q12]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Your move is good because it nullifies the power of White's wall... But I think that it should be at Q12 or R12, or even in Q13 or R13 because it isn't  good to play near a opponent's strong group...]

Ty for reviewing and I also would like to have many variations to make upo for the short game
________________________________________
[eversonyoshi\]: No... You were tired... If had kept your pace from the beginning, I believe that you had won... I think that there is a way to win, but I agree with you that this is very difficult... you have to kill the marked White stones and halt the invasion from L19 and A9...

Well, it's difficult to give you some advices, since you were tired, but:

1) Avoid to play in this condition or play  this way, but just for fun... If you are tired, try to play slower, be more careful, count more...

2) Try to solve Life and Death Problems (Tsumegos), the site Go Problems is very good. It will help you to read better, it will teach you some Tesujis, how to kill and save some groups... Until you reach 10k-8k, try to solve many Tsumegos and play a lot, don't bother if you lose since you learn from these losses...

3) Fusekis and Josekis are more difficult to learn. You  will learn them with the time, reading Go books and watching Professionals games.

4) Don't attack very close. Attack to kill if you are sure that you can kill it, otherwise, just threaten to kill and gain profit from it. If you can, attack the base of a group (the place near the edge where it would make two eyes...) and make the group run to the center, because it's more difficult to make two eyes in the center than in the edges...

5) Kakari and Shimari usually have the same value in the beginning. If you like to defend, play a Shimari. If you like to attack, play a Kakari.

6) You did it right, but be careful. White made many "heavy" groups in this game, avoid this.

7) Try to make moves that do two or three things, like: attack and make territory, defend and attack... Make your stones work together...

  You don't need all these advices, but you will learn new things in Go and it's important not forgetting these fundamentals... Good luck in your next games... =D]
