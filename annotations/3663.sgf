;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[fq];B[oc];W[qj]C[the conventional wisdom is that it's too good for black to for two corner enclosures in the opening. So usually white will play R10 as a kakari in the lower right.]
;B[ql];W[qg];B[ol];W[qq]C[this is definitly too early - big points remain at C4, C15 and after that there are extensions to be played...]
;B[qp];W[pp];B[oq];W[qo];B[rp];W[rn]C[this is a nice move];B[rq]
C[I don't see anything else than S3 ...

you're right - there is no other move.];W[rl];B[po]C[Q5 is slow, catching only a single stone and giving W the Q6 atari. B should better play a move at C4]
;W[pn];B[oo];W[qm]C[this white move is also slow, if anything, W should push at P6]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh]C[this move is an overplay]

(;W[ng];B[nj];W[ci];B[cp]LB[on:A]MA[jc][hq]C[I'm happy to play here, because I thought W would have played C3 instead of C11.

I'm just trying to put the right wall in use.

Other ideas were H3 or K17.

Any thoughts ?

building territory with your wall is not good, as long as the W move at A remains. I agree that C11 was a bit weird, so I think C4 looks very natural. The K17 move is not yet very big since you can still easily enter inside W's framework if he plays there and it doesn't build much territory for B.]
;W[dq]C[this move looks like it's strengthening B more than attacking... I would prefer playing just J3 or taking tenuki to play K17.]
;B[cq];W[iq];B[cm];W[cf];B[mg];W[nf];B[qi]C[misread here.

... and if you were planning on doing something here, why push at N13 to strengthen W first???]
;W[rj];B[qh];W[pg];B[hp]C[Here, I have a 'global strategy issue'

- W : 20 (upper let) + 8 (bottom) + 15 (right)
- B : 10 (top right) + 15 (bottom) + 10 (left)

There are no weak groups

Black has sente plus his central influence, which makes the game slightly favourable for B at this stage.

I have several options I can follow there

- Use the influence to attack :
I don't see a proper target, so I'm not sure I can use it efficiently enough

- get the big point at K17, but this would mean give away sente. I'm not happy with this.

- try to flatten white while beginning to form a potential central territorry.


3 questions :
- do you share my analysis ?

yes, I think your point count is quite accurate, but I don't agree with the conclusion! W has ~8pt more and komi -- sente is not worth that much at the moment, so my feeling is that it is close while B is in danger of falling behind.

- are my options correctly devised ?

K17 is certainly a big point -- but maybe it's better to probe the corner at D18? I don't like the direction of H4, as it looks like it's trying to build the left side where there is no chance of forming any territory. In these kind of positions I like to think it's best to play in the largest open space which is clearly on the top. If you later want to make center territory I think K4 is the right direction.

- is the choice (H4) proper to your judgement ?];W[hq];B[gp]
;W[fp];B[ip];W[jq];B[jp];W[kq];B[lo]C[W's direction of play here was a bit weird -- now you really have a chance to make quite a bit in the center.]
;W[do];B[dp]C[this was probably a mistake.]
(;W[eo]LB[co:B][eo:A]C[I'm happy white chickened ...

I don't agree - B is not possible in my opinion.];B[co];W[kp]
;B[ko];W[go];B[in];W[jd];B[fn]C[just preparing];W[fo];B[hc]
C[now I'm happy to use the influence.

However, this is not consistent anymore with what I prepared initially (central territory), but I thought there was more to prevent White making territory on top than I could achieve with the current central potential.

Any thoughts ?

H17 is clearly one step behind - W got to play on the upper side first, and your compensation was the wall on the bottom. You need to emphasise the center to have a chance. I would play moves like E14 to press W down from above.]
;W[mc];B[jb];W[he]C[now W is building influence in the center, naturally destroying your potential there]

;B[hb];W[hg]
(;B[dh]LB[dh:A][ih:B]TR[dc][gc][hd][he][cf][hg][ci]C[Now I'm being jealous (see variation) , but couting made me decide that I could sacrifice the central potential.

I though that because of H18, I could limit White potential.
With D12, I hoped to  dame the upper central zone.

Any thoughts ?

this is a difficult position -- I think I would prefer to play at H11, it seems like the key point for expanding both the B and W moyous]
;W[ch];B[gf]C[the only reason to play this move is if you were planning on cutting at G16 next...]

no, I think giving the two stones at the bottom is too much]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[ik];B[dr]C[bigger than centre, I thought, and sente.]
;W[er];B[eq];W[fr];B[da]C[same thought.];W[db];B[fa];W[ca];B[ea]
;W[cc];B[df];W[cg];B[de];W[ce];B[re];W[rf]TR[ck][kk][mr]C[At this point, I was happy, because I had played several sente reductions.

23 top
13 left
14 bottom right
10 potential centre ?

total black ~ 60

However, F10 is not totally connected.
and I have sente

18 left
10 bottom
18 right
5 komi

total white ~  61

In the game, I thought I had the lead, though.

18+18+10+5 = 51, not 61... You have the lead now!

I had a real problem here to decide what to play ...

C9 is small and gote, but helps F10
N2 not 'really' sente
L9 gote for ~ 10 points

these moves are all big, but I prefer C9 -- it's big and helps the B group a lot. If you are leading, this kind of steady move is best.]
;B[ck]C[I chose safety first.

Any other idea ?

no, I agree with your assesment.];W[di];B[gh];W[ji]
