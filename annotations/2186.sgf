C[Erik:
I am ranked at 4k on KGS and played this game against another 4k.
I resigned this game.
I made some major blunders that I could identify, and these cost me the game.  But I also feel that I was outplayed in all-round.
I am using CGoban for SGF editing and viewing.

Forfun (ff):
In this game both players fought hard.  I was struck, however, by the number of times each decided to finish in one area and play in another.  Although playing first in a particular area can give you the initiative, playing last in a particular area can give you the profit :-)

Another thing to be more concerned about is the difference between strong and weak stones.  Fundamentally we do not want to make weak stones.  They represent a real penalty because sooner or later your opponent will use them to reduce your territory or increase their territory (usually both at the same time :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[lp]C[Erik:
I am a bit uncertain how to handle this stone.
But felt(feels) there was no urgent need to respond so I played tenuki.

ff - Approaching the lower right from around here is one of the basic ideas in the Chinese Fuseki in professional play. The normal play is one line closer to the corner at N4 rather than M4 here. This play threatens to play into the corner next.  It is unusual for Black to tenuki here.  See the variations.]

(;B[jd]C[ff - This is a big point but if White disrupts the connection between the lower right corner and the stone on Q9, then Black's upper right framework is not actually that big.  Right now if Black answers in the bottom right, he has the advantage over White in the number of stones each has played.  Black should think hard before giving up this advantage by tenuki.]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[ff - This is a reasonable choice by Black. See the variations.]
;W[pp]C[ff - I think this was not a good choice by White.  It should be difficult for White to use the stone on M4 after this.]
;B[qp];W[oq]
(;B[pr]C[ff - The lower edge is not the critical point here.  Besides the Black stone waiting at Q9, Black earlier played tenuki in the lower right in order to add the stone at K16.  It is necessary for Black to make maximum use of those stones so the right side and upper right corner should be what Black is aiming for. See the variations.

In addition, the stone at Q2 is bad shape.  It leaves behind the cutting point at R3.  If Black is going to play along the bottom, he should play R2 (expecting White Q2, Black R3) or the solid connection at R3.]
;W[pn]
(;B[qh]C[ff - Black may not like being pushed along the side on the third line.  However, in this case there is a fourth-line stone waiting.  Playing away at this point was very unfortunate for Black.  This stone is also in the wrong direction.  White will naturally play R6.  Thereafter the slide in to S9 is available so the side is small.  If Black does want to play away (and he should not :-), C6 or F17 look more reasonable.]
;W[qn]
(;B[jq]C[Erik:
In hindsight this move is probably to heavy.

ff - Since Black played away in the corner once (actually twice if we go back to the beginning :-), I think the first priority should be to expand the corner with P2 before anything else.

Black seemed to be in a great hurry throughout the beginning of this game.  It would have been better to finish the fighting in one place before moving on to the next.  In this case the corner is left weak.  White can play forcing moves from either side.  As a result Black can not reasonably expect a good result from fighting in this area.  In that sense K3 has to be considered an overplay.]
;W[gq]
(;B[lq]C[ff - Better to jump out for now.  Again since the corner is weak, Black can not expect to settle these stones by playing in this direction.]
;W[mq]
(;B[lr];W[or]C[ff - This is the basic problem with Black's play in this area.  Black's corner is weak so White can make moves like this.]
;B[rq];W[kp];B[hr];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip]
(;B[hq]C[ff - Better to push along, see the variation.];W[hp]
;B[mr]C[ff - The wrong direction.  G2 would have been much more to the point.]
;W[gd];B[cf];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[ff - This pincer does not have a great deal of meaning here because of White's position to the left.  Black should play from the other side. See the variations.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[ff - Was this the right side to block on?  Although it cuts off one White stone, White naturally lives big in the corner and undercuts the two Black stones further down the side.  Black should not be satisfied with the result.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]
(;W[qf]C[ff - White is thinking of the joseki when there is no stone on R12.  Once that joseki is played, R12 is one of the forcing plays that Black can choose.  Since the stone has already been played, Black can exploit it immediately.  This stone should have been on S14.]

(;B[ni]C[ff - Of course Black has to look after his defect.  But this should already have been done.]
;W[nb]
(;B[oa]C[ff - This move is a tactical mistake.  If Black plays O19, White can only cut Black in gote.  By simply descending to P19 Black hands sente to White.]

(;B[cc]C[ff - This was questionable.  Black has various weak stones around the board.  The play into the corner will naturally increase White's outer thickness and create more threats to Black's other stones.]

(;B[ks];W[ms]C[Erik:
My moves from here on out is a desperate, and futily attempt to kill the white group.  I do not think there is any realistical chance of that suceeding, so you may ignore the remainding plays.

Erik:
A question of form:
Seeing that this game would be lost unless I could kill white, and knowing that it would take a huge mistake by white for that to suceed, should I have resigned here rather than play the moves out.

ff - Yes, I think you should have. In this case the situation was not so complicated.  As you said, it would have taken a huge mistake.  If that was your assessment, then better to resign.  However, we all make mistakes in every game we play so if you feel there are still some reasonable chances, play on.]

(;B[pg]C[ff - As the game shows, Black is troubled by the defect in his position.  It is probably best to fix this as soon as possible.  Suddenly White is sitting in the middle of only strong stones. This type of play is very powerful.  The connection cures the defect in Black's position and makes the Black stones strong, erasing the White thickness along the bottom at the same time.  Now White's three stones have nothing to aim at.  Black will naturally gain while the White stones struggle.]

I would pick C6 I think.  If you want to play in the upper left, at least it must be F17.  The G17-style approach to a star-point is almost never seen in professional play.  It has occasionally been used when the stone on K16 is threatened by White stones further right.  Black must expect White to play E17 and take the corner territory.]
