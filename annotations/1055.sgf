C[Hi and thanks a lot for review this game.
In my notes I refer to the move number thinking at the first handicap stone as the number 1.
I write some questions but, please, add every comments that you think can help me.
I put a question mark after my rank 'cause I haven't actually an "official one".
Thank you very much, Sean.

n - Here you go!   Ness (Hubris)];B[pd];W[tt];B[dp];W[tt];B[pp]
;W[cc];B[pj]C[Black 7: Can the san-ren-sei be considered the right choice?

n - I don't see why not.  It works with your other stones on the fourth line.]
;W[jd];B[dd];W[cd];B[dc]MA[jd]C[Black 11: this is a bloody blunder of mine...the right joseki was Black11 at D15, right?
I think that this move and the following sequence represent the 80% of my defeat.

n - Well, I don't like the approach at D16.  That move is designed to get outside influence, but with the marked W stone, it won't work very well.  I don't think this move is so bad, I think you made your mistake in later moves.]
;W[de];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[gc]LB[ee:a]C[...after the blunder of Black 11 I find myself rapidly buried by White...

n - Hane at A here.  Your stones are a little weak, but not so bad.]
;B[gb];W[hb];B[fb];W[hc];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[ee];B[ga];W[ea]
;B[eb];W[cn];B[fo]C[Black 29: maybe a pincer attack would be better, but I was afraid of the white wall in the upper left corner...after White 30 and looking at the end of the game where White got all the left board, I think that a pincer would be better at all, isn't it?

n - I like this move, it works well with your other stones, which are oriented towards the middle, and also forces W to make territory with his strength.]
;W[dj];B[jp]C[n - Good.];W[qn];B[nq]C[Black 33: better at O4?

n - Probably, but it gives you a wonderful chance to capitalize on W's mistakes in a few moves...]
;W[rp]C[n - This is a very bad move, and gives you a great opportunity, see variation.]

(;B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[on]C[n - This is a disaster for black.]
;B[bp]LB[cl:a][fe:b][ce:c]C[n - This may be your best move, because you have let W get so strong towards the middle on the right, but it uses your outward-facing stones to make a rather insecure side territory.    Actually, I think it would work better if you mixed it up at A instead.  W still has a weakness if you play B and C.]
;W[pf];B[nc]LB[qf:a]C[n - I like A better.];W[nj];B[oh];W[nf]
;B[mh];W[ni];B[nh];W[lf];B[li];W[mn];B[lp]C[Black 53: too much defensive, I suppose.  Maybe an attack against White stones 44/48 would be better, but I can't figure out how to attack them effectively.
Help me, please!!!

n - You are not in a position to attack, your stones are too weak.  Your move looks fine to me.]
;W[po]C[n - This is a slow move.  You must take the opportunity to strengthen your stones in the middle.]
;B[pm]C[n - This gives W back the initiative.];W[op]LB[lk:a]
C[n - Actually, you can even ignore this and play at A.  This would give you a much stronger position in the middle.]
;B[oq];W[qh];B[rd];W[ph];B[oi];W[oj];B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]
;B[ql];W[om];B[qm]C[n - I'm not sure you need this move...it would really only be useful in attacking W, better to move into the middle first.]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[jm];B[lk];W[ml];B[jk];W[hp];B[io]C[Black 77: I think that here (with this stone and the following sequence) I can do better that this.
My original idea was to try to cut White 76 from White 72...

n - I think it's OK, actually...you strengthen your middle stones, which are a little weak.]
;W[ho];B[in];W[hn];B[im];W[fm];B[hm];W[fn];B[fp];W[gm];B[hk]
;W[fj];B[hi];W[hr];B[fr];W[jq];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ks];B[ls]
;W[js];B[lr]LB[hf:a][fe:b][fh:c][cj:d][ce:e]C[n - You did not have to play here.  You have made good shape with the marked moves, so you could take sente for a move like A, B, or C.  There are even possibilities at D because of the weakness at E.]
;W[lc];B[rf];W[rg];B[jg]C[Black 103: at this point of the game I was thinking to try to do something to the left of Black 89  to invade or to reduce that White area, but I was unable to read out something that works.
Was too late to search something on this way and what I can do?

n - This is a slow move, you should go out into W territory!]
;W[if];B[lg];W[mf];B[kf];W[ke];B[ig];W[hf];B[qe]LB[fi:a]C[n - This is very slow also.  You should play something like A.]
;W[mb];B[nb];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[hg];W[gg];B[oe];W[of];B[ne]
LB[am:a]C[n - You have a much better move at A.];W[np];B[iq]
C[Black 123: I think that after Black 123 I had a choice to do more damage to White in this part of the Goban...but I fail in my intention! Can you suggest me something?

n - Oh, that's a good move, I didn't see it.  See notes below.]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[gq];B[ip];W[eq];B[fq];W[cq];B[ep]LB[cp:a]C[n - You have a chance to win the game here, you must grab it!  You play too nicely sometimes!  Play A.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[cr];B[er];W[do];B[gr]LB[gp:a][gn:b]C[n -- Wrong side.  Play A, and threaten the snapback at B.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[na];B[oa];W[ma];B[ob];W[kl];B[kk];W[sr];B[rs]
;W[jf];B[kg];W[gj];B[hj];W[hh];B[ih];W[qf];B[sf];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[ba]C[n - You should have taken this in sente.];B[rj]C[Black 159: looking at the next moves, maybe Black 159 was better at T6? Here White stole me other four points.]
;W[sk];B[sj];W[sm]LB[sl:a]C[n - Play at A and kill W.];B[jn]
;W[kn];B[jl];W[km];B[ko];W[lo];B[gl];W[fl];B[mk];W[nk];B[mj]
;W[ll];B[md];W[ld];B[mc];W[kb];B[sg];W[gk];B[hl];W[pq];B[qr]
;W[me];B[ss]C[Black 185: looking at the following White move at P13, catching other two points, Black 185 was better at P13, right?

n - Your move is worth 0 points, but W should respond.];W[og]
;B[go];W[gn];B[gp];W[eo];B[ha];W[ia];B[pe];W[dr];B[ds];W[cs]
;B[es];W[ca];B[da];W[sq];B[pp];W[sh];B[si];W[rh];B[pq];W[sl]
;B[pn];W[nl];B[mi];W[sn];B[mg];W[ng];B[qi];W[rk];B[rl];C[The End: White win by 38 points. It is a shame for me, just because two days before this game I play with the same White player an even game and (obviously!) I lost, but I lost by 35 points!
More handicap stones = worse lost   ...doesn't sound me!
Thank you very much for every suggestion to improve my poor play!

n - Your style is good, in that you make good shape, but you are too shy.  Once your stones are strong, you must attack and reduce.  You must learn to play tenuki when your opponent plays slow moves, and you must only play the important moves yourself.]
