C[Hello, my name is Tom and this is my first game to submit.  In general, I felt like I had a difficult time keeping my opponent out of my territory.  I'm not sure exactly why I lost or what my weaknesses were.

-- Hi Tom, my name is Zoran, I'm from Serbia.  At KGS I'm rated 8k and my nick there is Wayward, so if you have any additional questions you can leave me a note there or e-mail me at bruce@tesla.rcub.bg.ac.yu.  I hope this review will be interesting and useful. At any rate, don't take anything I say for a Heavenly Truth; every Go player has his/her own playing style, and what looks good for one may look disasterous to another (as you probably know ;) ). Just think over my variations and see if anything I say molds into your playing concepts.  Anyways, have fun, and a Happy New Year!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj]LB[ci:A]TR[dc][dp]C[-- For White it will be good here to go for the "Chinese opening", a popular fuseki pattern formed by the two triangled stones and another stone finishing it up at A.  Check out a variation for White.]

(;W[od]C[-- the idea here looks good, keeping Black low on the top left, but bear in mind that Black has some pretty straightforward josekis to utilize the power of the Q10 stone.  I'll show you two simple ones in the variations, it's useful to wield them in a similar situation with you playing Black.]

(;B[oc]C[-- Now that we've covered some good answers for Black, it's strange to see a low attach-and-extend (Japanese "tsuke-nobi") played here.  Your opponent should have played any of the previous two josekis for a good start (note: both of them started with an attachment at P15, on top of White stone; you do that when you want to go for influence).]

(;W[og]C[-- Standard response here, as far as tsuke-nobi joseki goes, is shown in the variation.  This two-space jump here is light, that is true, but in this situation there really is no good reason to avoid the standard exchange.]
;B[nc]C[-- Notice how Black immediately takes O7, the key spot for White stones which are now floating in the center without eyes.]
;W[jp];B[qg];W[jd];B[nd]TR[og]C[-- Given that the situation is already bad for White, he shouldn't make it worse by playing along with Black's attacks.  As a general rule of thumb, when you're outnumbered, be prepared to sacrifice something or you'll wind up haveing nothing at all.  Here, a possible way to play would be to play double hane and attempt to rescue the P13 stone (see variation).]

(;W[oe];B[qe]C[-- Not needed.];W[cj]C[-- Nice!];B[gc];W[ge]
C[-- This looks too high for my tastes, too loose, but actually it seems playable.  White just needs to stick to the moyo-making philosophy.]
;B[jb];W[lc]C[-- Looks good, it takes away Black's territory, but actually left side is more important.]
;B[lb];W[le];B[kc];W[kd];B[mc]LB[ne:A]TR[lc]SQ[kd][le]C[-- You could have happily let Black capture this unimportant stone and connect with 'A'. M17 really serves no purpose here, since your stones marked with rectangles will remain connected even after Black captures it.]
;W[ld];B[ic];W[ed]LB[ce:A][de:B]C[-- Good, now your moyo is getting large. Still, if you were afraid from Black's intrusion, you could have played 'A' or 'B'.]
;B[pm]C[-- Now take a look at the whole board. Which point is _the_ biggest for White to take and threaten to make some 100+ points?  Of course, it's K10! :)  See variation for the next move if this doesn't strike you immediately.]

(;W[mp];B[cf]
(;W[ce]LB[cd:A]C[I was hoping to keep as many points as possible in this corner.  would B14 or D14 have been better?

-- Contact plays usually help the attacker, and this holds here too.  If you want to keep your corner and make Black fight for life, C16 is more than sufficient.  See variation.]
;B[be]
(;W[df]C[-- Better to block on the second line, for territory. See variation.]
;B[cd];W[cg];B[de];W[bf];B[ce];W[bg];B[cc];W[ef];B[db]LB[eb:A]
C[-- There's nothing wrong with the block at 'A'.  It would bring you some points in the endgame as well.]
;W[gq];B[eb];W[ee];B[mq]
(;W[nq]C[I think perhaps this move was too aggressive.  Maybe M3 instead?

-- Yes, M3 definitely.  See variation.];B[lq];W[lp];B[nr];W[oq]
;B[or];W[pq];B[qp];W[pr];B[jr];W[kq];B[kr];W[ir];B[jq];W[iq]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[kq];W[io];B[np]C[-- Ouch!  This cut really hurt.]
;W[lo];B[op];W[rq];B[rp];W[ps];B[ms];W[qq];B[sq];W[sr];B[sp]
;W[rs]C[-- Surprisingly you managed to live here :)];B[os];W[cm]
;B[cn]C[It seems like I should be able to kill this stone since it is so close to my stones and so far from reinforcements...

-- Yes, that Black stone doesn't have a bright future.  It looks like a preparatory move for a 3-3 invasion that's about to follow. One move to prevent this and attack the lone stone would be to extend to C4 (see variation).]

(;W[dn];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[er];W[fq];B[bp]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[br];W[eo]C[was this overall a bad exchange for me?  It didn't seem like I could prevent this invasion.

-- Well, after you missed the initial mistake by Black (he should have invaded at 3-3 right away, not fool around), this was more or less what was expected. Both of you have made some bad moves in this sequence, from the standpoint of close combat, but that can only be helped by practice and reading excersises.  Studying joseki also helps; I've learned what the fight was really about only after I've studied some 10 or so basic josekis and their variations, and I can wholeheartedly recommend that, if you're a "passive study"-type like meself. ;)]
;B[fr];W[lg]LB[lj:A]C[-- This is the correct line of play, but beware, Black can still invade. 'A' would have done the trick.]
;B[li]C[-- Now, this stone looks too loose.  Knight-move jumps can be flexible, rigid, strong, weak, submissive, aggressive - but almost all of them, in almost all situations, are CUTTABLE!  Whenever you see your opponent play a knight's move, think about cutting it, if not right away, then at some point later in the game.  Remember, kogeima (small knight's move) and oogeima (large knight's move) are almost always a source to base your attack on. 
This move here looks like a veeeery streched-out knight's move, so naturally one should think about cutting and killing the intruder.  Check out the variation.]

(;W[jj];B[ji];W[il];B[kj];W[ni];B[ij];W[jk];B[nj];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[nk]C[I was sort of lost through this exchange, I'm not sure how I could have played better.]
;B[oj];W[mk];B[nh];W[ng];B[oi];W[lj]LB[kk:A]C[-- 'A' instead, it stops Black.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[ik];W[jl];B[mm];W[ll];B[nm]LB[ii:A]C[-- Whenever you get lost in exchanges like this (and this one really is a headbanger), there's a good chance your opponent will be lost as well, especially if you get that feeling that you're thinking the same way throughout the game.  In that situation, whichever player sobers up first and takes a look at the entire board, that player gets the chance to spot something that has been missed by both.  Here, White could actually save a lot of his territory by simply cutting at 'A'.]
;W[gk];B[ki];W[gh];B[hi]C[-- Interesting that you've played twice around it, but failed to see it during the game.  I'm sure you could see it right away after Black protected the cut.]
;W[gi];B[ok];W[ig]C[I think I did an ok job of cutting him of here, but it didn't win me very many points.

-- Yes, Black's intrusion is now stopped, but it was costly.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[mg];W[mf];B[mh];W[lh]LB[hd:E][pd:A][pf:B][ih:F]
[ph:C][no:D]C[-- This is not sente. In the endgame (or "yose"), think about playing moves that your opponent must respond to, or he will lose many more points.  I've marked several sente moves for you.  Also, be careful not to play moves that look like sente but actually make you respond to opponent's response, making them gote for you and sente for your opponent.]

[ar][cr][lr][mr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ks][ls][ns]C[-- That's it.  Without that endgame mistake on the left side you would have lost by about 25 or so points, and if you count the Black stones that are ruining your White balloon in the middle and multiply that by two, you'll see that it was a pretty close match before the endgame.  I'd even say that White was having advantage for the better part of the midgame.  It seems you lost because you failed to notice that advantage and turn it into secore territory while you could.

Overall, there's little practical advice I can give you at this point, since you seem more than capable to make your own way down the learning lane.  Study josekis, there's lots of material on the 'net about them.  And, more importantly - since you seem to be inclined towards making moyos - don't rush to respond to your opponents' moves.  Calmly measure the value of different spots on the board, to the best of your abilities, every once in a while.  The best time do to this is usually when the fight starts and just before the fight ends, so that you know which way to steer your opponent's boat.  And, most importantly - have tons of fun!

   I hope I wasn't too boring or overly instructive.  I get carried away when I try to explain things.  Just be happy you weren't next to me since I tend to wave my hands and hit everything that's in the way. ;)

G'bye and Happy New Year!

Best,
Zoran])

It's very VERY important to retain sente after the fight here is over, that is, you will want to secure that stone (either make it live or flee towards the center) so that after Black completes his structure you get the chance to play 'A'.  'A' is big because it forms something similar to the Black's (now destroyed) "double-wing" formation, and we couldn't have played it before because Black would solidify his double-wing before we did that to ours, and ours isn't a read double-wing at all ;)]
