C[-- Hello Odrade, my name is Sven and I´m about 9 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 14 kyu on KGS. All my comments are preceded by "--", so you can more easily spot them.
If something remains unclear or you have additional questions, do not hesitate to write me! I hope I can help a bit.

-- Basically, the play was well-balanced as concerns your and your opponent´s reading abilities and short-distance fights. However, often you are concerned too much about securing territory instead of building influence. You firmly held to the rule "first the corner, then the side, then the center", which generally is right; on the other hand, it is easier to prevent a big moyo then to invade or reduce it. After the opening game, White was far ahead as concerned influence, and what made him win only scarcely was his failure to turn it into territory.
So if you ask me how you could have reduced White´s moyo more effectively (apart from the notes in the game):
1. Don´t get closed in into all corners. Use the 4-4-point and 5-4-point sometimes, make extensions along the forth line.
2. Open up new territory.
3. Dispose willingly of stones which give only a few points, if you can make big moves elsewhere on the board. Try to think for a little(!) moment before each move, if it is necessary now or wether you should play elsewhere.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[oq];B[dq]C[-- You like the 4-3-point, don´t you? :-)]
;W[do];B[co]C[-- Here you want to secure the corner for Black. That´s ok, but you should keep in mind that this provokes White building a moyo in the upper left quarter.]

(;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[of]LB[pg:A]C[-- I think White should instead play A here.]
;B[pq];W[or]
(;B[pr]LB[op:A]C[-- Too concerned about corner territory. Till now, you have 3 corners, but no access to the center. Better at A.]
;W[oo];B[qn];W[pj];B[mc]LB[fc:C][mc:19][cf:A][qn:17][jp:B]C[-- 17 and 19 are two extensions along the edge. They secure a certain amount of territory, but that´s it all. White need not answer and has sente to play elswhere.
Instead, you should open up new territory, e.g. at A, B or C]

(;B[dc]LB[gd:A]TR[hc]C[-- No! When you played H17, you wanted to make a base for your stones and attack the two white stones at the top (at least I hope so). Now forget about the corner and continue this attack, which will probably not kill White, but prepare you a way into the center.]
