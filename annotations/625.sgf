C[OM: Hi. This is the first round from the Mindunai Cup 2001. I played Black against the current Lithuanian Champion (White). Although I beat him several times in club games, I never managed to do that in a tournament. This time I *almost* did it, missing a win by just 0.5 pts.

Actually, most of the game I felt quite well. I reached a comfortable lead until the second half of the middle game. Then I lost point by point until it was enough for my opponent to win.

Olaf Martens];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[qj];B[ql]LB[de:a]
C[OM: I have seen many pro games with 'A' instead of R8. I wish I knew why they prefer that.

E: maybe they see R13 and R7 as miai for W, so prefer to play elsewhere and save the choice for later; in which case, around D15 is the only kakari left (Q16 and D4 are hoshi, so traditionally a kakari against them is less urgent).]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[ph]LB[of:a][nd:b][pi:c]C[E: hmm, usual for W is W P14, B O16, W Q11.
This move Q12 gives B good options.];B[re]C[E: nice];W[qg];B[nc]
C[E: my impression is, B has better result .];W[jp]C[E: W looks for his fortune in center oriented game, since the R13 group gives thickness if anything. Usually, playing fourth line when P3 is there is less then ideal.]
;B[cf]C[E: B seems to think he has a lead, so tries to simplify the game. good approach.]
;W[ci]C[E: W declines, as should];B[cc]
(;W[cb]C[E: C16 looks better, see variation];B[bb]C[OM: I don't know this kind of joseki at all.

E: hmm, so maybe shouldn't play it in tournament game... If W playes the twice-atari, the ladder works for B (though the problem of a ladder-break remains) so W should just force B to a low position, B gets settled, reasonable for both sides.]
;W[cd];B[bc];W[dd];B[bd];W[df]
(;B[ce]C[E: A tight move, B should already start thinking about a foothold toward the center, mainly because of W R13 and K4. see variation. The idea is to challenge W , deny him his game plan.]
;W[jc]LB[de:a][ee:b][ed:c]C[E: hmm I'm not sure about this one. If now B D15, W can't block at E15 because of B E16, so probably W plans F16 or so, but then B E14 - I don't like it for W. But I guess W D15 B K17 is painful too. so treating D14 as a forcing move  is probably ok.]
;B[cq]C[OM: I thought this part of the board was now most important. I chose this invasion because:

1. I take away the corner and keep sente which I can later use to eliminate W's outside influence, e.g. around K10.

2. I couldn't think of anything better. :)

E: :)
There are 2 relevant proverbs : "If you have 4 corners, you won" and " if you have 4 corners, resign" ...

How about C7 ? C14 is solid, so it makes sense to put some pressure on C11. If W C5, that's ok - P3 means he will not get much territory on the lower side, and c7 cuts his moyo hopes while pressing C11.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[cn];B[eb]LB[gd:a]C[E: ouch ! what for ? as you said, B should be thinking on reducing the center moyo, not attacking here. I mean, this move gives W a valuable profit, so the only redemption is attack follow-up, maybe G16; but why look for trouble ?
B has now about 55 safe points, let W prove he can get more while not giving more to B. Standard D10 move looks quite ok.]
;W[db];B[hc]C[E: W could go for a fight here, K15, B maybe F16, W D15 - after that, C13 etc is sente - and try to build the moyo while attacking, K17-K15 will have help from R13 group.]
;W[hd]C[E: This seems to let B off the hook too easy.];B[ic]
;W[id];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[gc];B[gb];W[gd]C[OM: Is this the maximum possible for B at the top?

E: W D15 looks better to me - as I said, it makes C13 and B19 sente.

B got settled and sente, which is , I feel, more than B should have got from the E18 move.]
;B[ij]LB[lc:a]TR[cf][ql]C[OM: 'A' became a big point later in the game. But now it seemed to me 'not sente enough'. At this moment, I thought a play around J10 necessary to prevent W from creating a big center. The exact spot J10 was just guessing. Would be interesting to learn how to pick the right spot in such a situation.

E: The idea is to use what you have on the board. W has a weakness around D13, and you could use your R8 stone (remember that W Q7 etc. is pretty much sente). try to avoid having to live surrounded, unless you are really confident in succeeding (It is said Kitani Minoru was an expert on this). at least have some helpful stones nearby you can threat to connect to, and use those threats to live. Remember you just got territory where W expected some (top side) and given more thickness in return, so be willing to give W more territory than you would have before the top side exchange. Thus, J10 seems to me too deep - Would probably play kikashi at  Q7, then attack severely. In general I would prefer B's position here, but don't give W a chance for all-or-nothing fight.
Myself, I would play K6 here.];W[gj]C[E: this is way to placid. W can't get enough territory, W has to attack.]
;B[il];W[gl];B[in]C[OM: This was too much.

E: In my opinion, J10 was too much... W just decided now to try to attack, but better late than never.]
;W[kn];B[lq]C[E: W is in no position to fear a cut now. This 3rd line move just give w another kikashi (N4). If your group lives, the extra points around N2 will not matter, and the same if it dies.
Play L7 here to get some eye space, living should not be too difficult after W's 2 moves at G10-G8.]
;W[jk]
(;B[ik]C[E: too heavy. push and cut, or attach at L7. See variations.]
;W[jm];B[jj];W[im];B[jg]C[OM: Again guessing the right moves.
E: K8 looks crude but effective to live.
Looks like you are still trying to erase W potential territory while trying to live. you can't afford it now, just focus all your efforts on living without losing too much ground (that is, while answering W kikashi moves such as Q7 and N4). W should now strike at L12.]
;W[kf]C[E: not enough pressure on B.];B[gi]C[E: good.];W[fi]
;B[gh];W[fh];B[gg];W[rp];B[qo]C[E: did you count the game ? allowing W to live here makes it very close. after W's not-very-effective play against your center group, you should play s3. It is always a balance of what you can afford to give and what not. of course you should continually count the game to know that.

Remember the Q11-P12 forcing moves you have , or R11-S10.];W[ro]
;B[rq];W[qn];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[rl];B[pl];W[rk];B[mn]C[E: this is small. M17, B12, S14 for example, bigger. and H10 you should take real fast.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[kg];B[jl];W[kk]C[E: I don't understand the reason for this move.
now that W traded thickness for territory on the lower right, he can't expect to be so stubborn about B's eyes.]

C[OM: W misread this whole thing, and B was happy to be ahead.

E: true, I can't see how B loses now...];B[nl];W[nh];B[ll];W[lo]
;B[np]LB[lc:a]C[OM: B is too happy and plays THE losing move. 'A' is very big here.

E: true, 'a' is bigger, but I think B should still win.];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[mb];W[jq];B[fc]C[E: B12 bigger, so is T4, and H10 is still waiting... and of course, O16 !]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[nq];W[nd];B[od];W[oe];B[jf]C[OM: risky, risky. After the game, we discussed the variation starting with W at A. (See variation)
