C[tsjanl:

Dear RicePaddy,

Thanks for letting me review your game. It was interesting to do, and I think I learn at least as much from it as you will from reading this review.

I tried to concentrate on general concepts, because that seems to be the most important at your stage of development. That's why I didn't include too many variations (apart from the fact that I would make a lot of mistakes in them).

Be aware that I am 14k at KGS, and only play go for a year, so that I can't tell you 'the truth' about your game. I hope it is good enough to be of value.

This being my first review, I asked Douwe, a club member (8k), to have a look at it. He was so kind to add some remarks.

So, here we go...];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[jq]LB[nc:C]
[jd:D][dj:E][pj:B][qj:A]TR[qp][oq]C[tsjanl: Black's shimari (corner enclosure) in the lower right works best with a black stone around A/B (Q10/R10). In general White answers P3 with A (R10), to avoid Black getting this favourable setup.

If White doesn't like to play on Black's side yet, the top or the right side are more profitable than the bottom. Black's low stone on P3 makes the bottom uninteresting for both players. Moves like C, D and E (O17, K16, D10) are some possibilities.]
;B[kc]LB[fc:D][jd:C][pj:B][qj:A]C[tsjanl: Black misses the chance to play on A or B (R10/Q10). 

Locally, the played move would have been better placed at C (K16). L17 is too far away from Q16 to help in protecting the corner, while it is too low to have enough influence. After C, D (F17) would be a good extension that puts pressure on White's corner.]
;W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[tsjanl: White is the first to play in this important region. Because White plays on the fourth line (instead of at A (R10)), he will have some difficulty securing his group. This can give you the possibility to chase him while making profit yourself.]
;B[qh]C[tsjanl: Good. You take advantage from White's previous move by threathening to slide under him, while strengthening the upper right. In general it's good to play moves that serve more purposes.]
;W[pm]C[tsjanl: White plays a dangerous game by leaving the base for his stones open at both sides.










Douwe: White is not in real danger since he is out in the center, this may be as gaad as making a base I think, this way maybe is works a little better with his other stones

and blacks upper right corner is open to all kinds of invasions]
;B[qm]LB[oh:A][dj:B]C[tsjanl: In general it's not wise to touch the stone you are attacking. It strengthens the opponents stone.

While White is vulnerable, because he has no base, it's not needed to exploit that immediately. If you rob him of his base, he still can go into the center. On the other hand, when you put pressure on him from the outside, you will make profit yourself, while White can eventually be forced to make a base at the side. He will end in gote, which will give you a free move.

At this moment, I would prefer a move around A, which puts pressure on the white group while beginning a moyo (framework) in the upper right. Another possibility would be to switch to the left side with a move around B (D10).]
;W[ql]
(;B[rl]C[tsjanl: See variation.];W[qk];B[qi]C[RicePaddy: i think this move at R11 was a mistake and maybe a move at r6 would've been better

tsjanl: You are right. R11 doesn't threaten anything, while it doesn't bring you territory or influence either.

Douwe: More important: White can make eyeshape by capturing the S8 stone. A must connect position here.]
;W[qn];B[rm]C[tsjanl: Maybe this was a good moment to switch to the left side. White's group isn't weak anymore, so chasing it won't help you much. Saving R7 brings you only second line territory, which makes White happy.]
;W[rn];B[rk];W[qj]LB[rj:A]C[tsjanl: An empty triangle that forces Black to play a move he wants to play anyhow (A (S10)).]
;B[rj];W[po]
(;B[qo]C[tsjanl: See variation.];W[pp]
(;B[qq]C[RicePaddy: Would Q3 be just as good or better than R3?

tsjanl: Q3 leaves a nasty cut at R3, that could create a lot of problems. (See variation).]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[op];B[nq]
(;W[ic]LB[dj:B][or:A]C[tsjanl: At first I thought White had a opportunity at A (P2). But Douwe showed that it is not that good. (See variation).

A move around B (D10) would be better then at J17, because L17 is low.

Douwe: in general white's strategy in the right side has worked out well, he build influence and reduced black territory there.]
;B[dj]C[tsjanl: Excellent. The last big point on the board.]
;W[dg]
(;B[eh]C[tsjanl: This move gives White the opportunity to strengthen his corner, while Black doesn't get a lot in return. See variation.]
;W[dh];B[ei];W[eg]TR[eh]C[tsjanl: The result of E12: Black hasn't created eye space or territory and just a bit influence. White on the other hand is strengthened a lot.]
;B[gh];W[dm]LB[cl:A]C[tsjanl: This is a severe move, although I would like to play it at A (C8).


Douwe: or one line below A (C7)];B[el]LB[cl:A]C[tsjanl: This is a difficult position. At first I thought that making a base at the side (for example at A (C8)) would be better, because it's easier to make an eye there. With E8 you create a floating group that gives White lots of attacking possibilities.

But Douwe remarked that it is not that sure that Black can make a base, so that walking out isn't that bad.]
;W[dl];B[em];W[en]
(;B[ck]C[RicePaddy: i think i went here instead of just at D9 because i think i was trying to extend into Barorton's territory more.  Would B9 be as good or would it be too much?

tsjanl: Going to the second line early in the game is seldom good. (See variation).]
;W[di]C[tsjanl: With his next two moves, White is helping you to secure your group.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[ci];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[bn]

(;B[al]LB[bo:A]C[RicePaddy: i think a move at C6 would be better than this.  i was playing a bit too defensively i think.

tsjanl: C6 doesn't work. See variation.

For the endgame your move leaves the possibility of A (B5) (suggestion of Douwe).]
;W[do];B[fg]LB[gd:A][nh:C][gp:B]C[tsjanl: Let's have a look at the board at this moment. The skirmish on the left did give Black a living group with center influence. In exchange White has strenghtentened the upper and lower left.

If you just push from your center group (like you do here), you offer White the possibility to turn his area of influence to territory. It will give him a lot more profit than it will you. The reason for that is that because it is a corner, White has only cover two sides, while you, trying to create center territory, have to take care of four sides.

That's why I would prefer an invasion here, for example around A or B (G16, G4), or a moyo move around C (P11).]

(;W[gq]LB[il:A]C[tsjanl: Far too carefull. With White's strength in the lower left and the right  a move around A (J8) would be a lot stronger. (See variation).]
;B[lp]LB[fd:A][nh:B]C[tsjanl: But this is too timid too. Because of the strong White and Black groups around the center, there will be not much profit there. I still prefer an invasion around A (F16) or B (O12).]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[kp];B[ko]C[tsjanl: Whith this contact move you strengthen White as much as yourself. The problem is that with every move here, White makes territory, while Black doesn't.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[jn];B[jm];W[mq];B[np];W[mn]TR[pm][kn][ko][po]
[lp][mp]C[tsjanl: White plays at a very good point. It works good with his two marked stones and against your marked stones (remember these patterns, you will see them a lot). You can also see that with just one stone, he has eliminated your prospects of territory in this area.]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[nn]LB[gd:A][nh:B][kj:C]C[tsjanl: This is small. You could look at moves around A (G16), B (O12) or C (L10).

Douwe: how about C17?

tsjanl: Yes, that's big too. I come back to that at move 119.]
;W[lm];B[oo];W[pn]C[i kinda lost my concentration here because Baronrton and I were chatting about ourselves. But only for a couple moves or so.

tsjanl: You lose a few points. At the same time, much more points were to be won on other parts of the board.]
;B[km];W[on];B[om];W[no];B[mo];W[nm];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl]LB[gd:A]
[nh:B][kj:C]C[tsjanl: Your stones are caught. Just leave them and play on a big point.]
;W[ml];B[kk]C[tsjanl: Good, although I think you could play it one line higher.]
;W[lk]C[tsjanl: Now White is making the same mistake as you did earlier: walking with you in an area where you can make more territory than he can.]
;B[lj];W[mj];B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[nh];B[mg];W[oh]C[tsjanl: This has been a very profitable exchange for you.]
;B[pg];W[md];B[nd]LB[ke:A]C[tsjanl: In general, don't play contact moves when you are defending.

After a move at A (L15), White will have difficulty getting life, while you build strength to attack the upper left.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[mf];B[ng];W[og];B[nf];W[lf];B[oe];W[me];B[of]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[lh];B[lg];W[kd]TR[md][me][kf][lf]C[tsjanl: That shape again.]
;B[mc];W[jc];B[lc]LB[kb:A]C[A (l18) gives better shape.

Douwe: and endgame oportunities];W[ld]
(;B[jf]LB[cc:B][gd:A]C[tsjanl: Now that you have strengthened White on the top, an invasion around A (G16) has gotten more difficult. So I think this is a good moment to invade at B (C17).

In general, the disadvantage of a 3-3 invasion is that White can form a nice wall. But now his wall will not have a lot of influence, because his stones are too close. If you wait with invading, white will get more stones in the area, so that it will become difficult/impossible. 

(See variation)];W[je];B[if];W[go]
(;B[hn]C[should i have gone at G6 instead?

tsjanl: G6 is a dangerous contact move. I would prefer G7. See variation.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[ho];B[in];W[io];B[hm];W[fm];B[fl];W[fn]

;W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[he];W[fd];B[fe];W[ee]
(;B[ef]C[tsjanl: This is not a good move, because it is gote. Your position is strong enough to keep it unplayed for the moment. (See variation).]

;W[kb];B[lb];W[ka];B[la];W[ib];B[pi];W[oi];B[ro];W[gj]C[tsjanl: I don't like these kind of operations. Black is so strong in this area, that he has to make a big mistake to blow it. When you play on the possibility your opponent will make a mistake, you will not learn to play go very well.]

(;B[fk]C[RicePaddy: I think that moves 164-189 dragged on too long and they wasted a lot of my moves and my territory. I was unsure of how to defend my middle territory.

tsjanl: You didn't lose anything. For every stone you placed in your territory, you've got a prisoner in return. Only your last move wasn't needed, see variation.]
;W[qc]C[tsjanl: I think that White can only get a ko here. But on our level, this is always worth a try. That is why playing a stone here earlier is a good example of better save than sorry.

Douwe has added a variation to show that White has good chances.]

;B[ls]LB[kr:A]C[tsjanl: There aren't ko threats on the board as large as the upper right corner, but locally, A (L2) would be stronger.

tsjanl: Yes.];W[ir];B[iq]C[RicePaddy: I went here hoping that by putting the L3 group into atari, it would let me put J2 in atari so that i could extend more into White's territory..

tsjanl: Good.];W[hq];B[jp]C[White made a big mistake.

(;B[sn]C[i should've gone to invade the top left at maybe 3-3 instead of connecting here.

tsjanl: You are connecting two alive groups, which doesn't make a lot of sense. An invasion at 3-3 will be difficult, on the other hand. But you won't lose points with it, so you could try it.]
;W[cc]C[RicePaddy: and now the chance has gone =(  is there still any chance to invade top left?  I was thinking of maybe some how attacking the top middle group, but i didnt think its possible.

tsjanl: If you wanted to invade the upper right, you should have done it around move 134.]

Bao

tsjanl: You were not lucky because of the komi, that is there to compensate for the ranking difference. You were lucky because after White was far ahead in the middle game, he played slack moves and made big mistakes.

In general, you have played a good game for your strength. I have the impression that you are on that point where you play often the right moves locally, but where it's difficult to look at the whole board. That is a difficult step to take, but after you have made it, you will see that the game is even more beautiful than it seems already.

Things you could concentrate on in the comming time:

- in the opening, try to play on the sides that are most interesting (in general, where the stones are high, not low);
- attaching to your opponents stones is only wise when you are attacking in his area. Attaching makes both stones stronger, which helps the attacking party;
- don't walk along with your opponent if he will make more territory with it than you;
- try not only to play from you own stones, invade at the right moment, make bigger steps;
- don't try to save every stone;

- and most important: enjoy!
