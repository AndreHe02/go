(;W[en];B[fm];W[jm]C[At this point I think even I did not lost the upper right group at the end game.  I still lost by about 20 points. because of the lower right white territories. Am I right?
>>White's moyo is really huge at left side of the board, at this point white's invasions have been reductive only, that is, it's invading groups may haven't got much territory but reduced your area of influence. 
That means: 
1) Black has played passively, with no sente moves. 
2) White must learn how to invade better, so he can get territory at invading. 
3) Black must learn how to defend, sometimes the best defense is to attack. 

Knowing when to tenuki is crucial in Go strategy, at the same time it's related to Life and Death of groups and (a more subtle topic) Good Shape.

At this point of the game, Black loses because of White's moyo at left side, it's almost impossible to think of a way to invade and reduce that area.]
