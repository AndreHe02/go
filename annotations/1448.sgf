Review by John Rae  4k IGS

2nd Review by Arend, 4d* IGS
A: Hi Johan, hi John!
Nice game and nice review! Complicated fights... I'll add a couple of points.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq]C[I responded with E3.. I don't know if that's a good thing to do so 
JR : 
Black's immediate approach is a little unusual. I've never seen it this early in a game before.  I'm not sure its bad. I would prefer a more normal move taking another corner 
White 4 is perfectly solid. It is also possible to tenuki, pincer at G3 and so on. 
Black seems to be feeling aggressive and looking for a fight so playing solid seems OK

A: B3 may be unusual but it's certainly not bad.];B[cq]C[I thought he would play F3 or D4.. but C3.. came as a big suprise :) 
JR: Another black move I've never seen. 
I'm not aware of it being joseki so the trick is to discover how to punish it :)

A: This is indeed a mistake]
(;W[dp];B[dq]
(;W[er]C[A: My instinct would be to play B3 immediately.];B[bp]

(;W[cn]C[ 
JR:   Generally my thinking is that white will be happy to let black live small  in the corner so long as either 
a) white captures the E4 cutting stone, or 
b) white establishes safe groups both on the side and bottom leaving the cutting stone running away between them. 
I *think* B5 could turn out better but I confess I'm not sure.

A: B5 is a little better, but C6 is also a good move, nice shape for white.]

(;B[br]C[A: Now Black B5 looks mandatory.];W[bo];B[aq];W[cs]
C[A: Better leave that for later.];B[cr]
(;W[dc]C[ 
JR   The cutting stone splits white into two groups which can both be attacked. It becomes dangerous when  black strengthens this stone 
Its quite important for white to make sure both the groups in the corner are solid. 
White does not have time to play elsewhere at the moment. The variation looks to work out much better than the game.]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[gq]
(;W[gr]C[ 
JR White should tenuki here I think. A play in the bottom right would be good. 
After all if you sacrifice these 3 stones its not that many points. And as the game develops the threat to escape with them should be helpful to you.

A: It's a difficult decision. If black can capture white, he get's thick at the bottom.]
;B[hr];W[fp];B[fr]
(;W[fo]C[A: Bad. Better F3 immediately.];B[en];W[fq];B[gs]
(;W[fn]C[JR  This forces black to extend and attack white's group on the side.   It hurts white more on the side than it help the escaping group
A: The point John is making here cannot be stressed enough.]
;B[em]C[A: To be able to make such a move is wonderful. Gain liberties, strengthen your own group, weaken two opponent groups at the same time.

Never, ever even _think_ about making a move such as F6 again (that only presses
black out), and you will immediatley gain half a stone in strength. Promised!]
;W[cl]C[JR White 28 forced black 29 which forced this defence. Handing over sente like this is not helpful.]
;B[fm];W[ho];B[do];W[co];B[jp]
(;W[dk]C[JR Again I think you're playing from the wrong direction 
36 will push black towards the centre - which gains more liberties and also an attack on the lower white group and so will be sente.

A: Just ask yourself: Which group is weaker, F6 or C8?];B[hm]
;W[in]
(;B[bk]C[kinda wasted move it seems B9.. 
JR I think I agree this is not the time for black to play here. 
The priorities for black are to make his running group secure while at the same time making territory by attacking the white running group.]
;W[kn]C[I was thankfull to him/her for this move :)];B[jm]
(;W[jn]C[A: I think this is a little submissive, see the variation.]

(;B[im]C[JR again this does not help black much. K7 will aid black in the future, even if only as a sacrifice. 
M4 seems the move to me. It keeps up the attack, stabalises the bottom making territory

A: I think I agree, but it's already difficult for black. The F7 group is weak. B9 is the move
that caused these problems.];W[lq];B[kq];W[lp]C[A: Bad shape for black.]
;B[oq]
(;W[iq]C[JR: 
See variation on black's next move. Black is alive, although I think you missed a chance to kill in the actual game. 
Therefore white might be better playing in the corner.
A: One thing to keep in mind is that E1 is sente on the corner. In most variations white can play this as a double threat, and black will have to give up the corner.]

(;B[ir];W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[po]
(;W[jq]C[JR   capturing the L3 stone is thinking about living 
H3 makes the eye at g2 false. Black cant get out and cant live]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[hp]
(;W[io];B[pl];W[ds]C[A: Better E1.];B[bs];W[fs]C[tried to make a ko here 
JR: The decision is whether your ko threats are big enough and whether you have enough. 
If you do not - simply wait and play to develop more big threats The ko will always be there, unless black uses a move to defend - in which case white gets two moves in a row. Good for white either way. 
It turned out well for white so this sequence was good.];B[es]
;W[gn]C[A: Goot threat!];B[dr]C[but the ko ended quickly :) 
JR  black did not think he had enough threats to fight the ko and did not accurately assess the danger.
A: Black has threats at D7 and L1 so he should connect at G7.]
;W[gm]C[A: This is very big.];B[gl];W[fl]
(;B[el]C[JR:   black does not look like getting away here. 
Black should sacrifice the stones and play elsewhere. Struggling and dying usually gives your opponent even more strength.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj];W[gk];B[dj];W[ei];B[di];W[eh];B[dh]
;W[cf]C[A: This asks black to move out at D14. You should either play D13, or if you want to keep it simple, extend at E13.]

(;B[dg]C[A: Better at D14.];W[bh];B[eg]
(;W[dl]C[JR: 
 white could keep moving with the 3 E12 stones. 
 So long as you keep enough liberties this capture will always be there - so your stones are safe. 
 I'm not sure it would be better though.

 A: The problem are the moves at C14 and B12 which ignored the shortage of liberties of E12.]
;B[ee];W[de];B[df];W[cd];B[ed]
(;W[cj]C[JR: 
 Capturing the B9 stone is small. White is alive above and below so connecting is not necessary. 
 Equally it is not important for black to connect to B9 - much more important to make eyes along the top 
 The biggest issue at the moment is that Black has all the stones in the top right. Now is the time to do something about that.]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[ec];W[ff];B[ef];W[db]
(;B[bi];W[ci]C[JR: Again I'm feeling white is squashed against the left side, i would want to play a more expansive move.]
;B[ch];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai];B[cg];W[ic]C[JR:  Good attacking];B[hb]

(;W[fb]C[JR: This move will turn out  badly I suspect
 A: Yes, now white will have to worry about the cut at C17 at every move.]
;B[eb];W[ea]C[JR: Having played F18 you feel the need to defend it, but this is black pushing white around - the position should have black struggling.]
;B[fc];W[gb]C[A: Better leave that out.];B[gc]C[JR and now black threatens an eye with F19]

(;W[bf]C[JR: 
 Were you thinking white needed this to live in the corner? Black is not going to get eyes over there. 
 If you think you can trap the black group you should connect at F19, even though it is gote. 
 If you are not sure if black can run away play a blocking move first. 
 Over all I think the best is to ignore this fight for the moment and approach the top corner. The objective would be to develop a stronger position at the top and *then* turn back to attack this group. 
 Its a matter of timing, White is not quite strong enough to kill at the moment so play moves which prepare for a possible kill later. Black will always have two things to worry about so there are good opportunities for White

 A: If you now abandon F18 and G18, you shouldn't have played them in the first place. This shows why F18 was a problematic move.]
;B[af]
(;W[ad];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[bd];B[bb];W[ba];B[da];W[ca];B[ga]

(;W[qh]C[JR: 
 The past few moves were a disaster for White. 
 Black was under severe attack but somehow black attacked white! 
 This invasion is OK in itself but one result is likely to be black developing along the top. Any remaining attack will vanish. Meanwhile black will be attacking the white invasion on the side.]
;B[qf];W[qk];B[ql];W[qp]C[JR: your 2 invading stones are not safe. Nor do they give any sort of support for this second invasion. 
 White looks like ending up with two weak groups under attack. 
 If you wanted to invade here I think you should have started here first. 
 Having invaded up the side the priority is to make the invasion safe, Black has a right to gain some territory while resiting the invasion, this side is clearly Black's area of influence, you canot expect to deny black any territory at all :)

 A: Yes, the correct move should be a  follow-up with S8 or Q9.
 But if you are willing to sacrifice some of the stones, you can try such a strategy. And you made nice use of these stones in the game!]
;B[qr];W[ll];B[jj];W[nc];B[pk]C[A: Good.];W[qe]C[A: Excellent!]
;B[qd]C[A: But black should block at Q15 here.];W[pe];B[oe]
;W[re];B[rd];W[pf];B[oc];W[nd];B[od];W[lj];B[kk];W[lk]C[JR: This attack on the centre stones is good for white. black cannot run without putting the big group in danger.]
;B[kc];W[kg];B[ke];W[ig];B[hk];W[gj];B[hj];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[ih];W[gg];B[ne];W[hl]C[JR: This move was not needed to connect your stones and I don't think it will kill the centre group so its not so important, although black will reply.]
;B[il];W[kh];B[ki];W[li]
(;B[kl]C[JR: I think black does not need this move to live and so should have taken sente.
 A: I think white can kill if black tenukis.];W[kj];B[ji]
(;W[km]C[black mid group is alive.. was there a way to kill it ? 
 JR: Not that I could see, 
 Also white 70 seems gote to me
 A: I agree on both points.]

C[the result was good for me, but b could have done much better than that I think 
 JR: Yes, I've shown some ideas as earlier variation.];W[om]

;B[if]C[A: Black has to play H16 immediately.]
(;W[hg]C[A: You missed a chance here: With G16, the game is over.
 A well-played game, and a well-deserved victory for white!
 Now if you adjust your thinking about such pressing plays as F6, and try to be a little shaper in not missing your changes (G16 here, H3 earlier), and finally try to improve your judgement on shape a little (remember F18?), I am sure you will be quickly improving.

 Good luck!
