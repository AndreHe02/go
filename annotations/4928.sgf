[cp:A][ip:B][pp:I][iq:C][pq:D]C[Imagist: This move is oddly placed.  In relation to the stone marked A, B and C are better moves, and if you want to develop the D stone, E or F would be better.  In this position C is probably the best move if you want to develop the side, but I would recommend an enclosure at E or F, or an approach at G or H instead.  A hoshi stone at I would be better placed to build a framework along the bottom.]
;W[jd]LB[ce:A][cf:B]C[Imagist: An enclosure at A or B would be better.]
;B[di]C[Imagist: Black's moyo is ambitious here (which is good).]
;W[pj]C[Imagist: This is large, but not large enough.  Black's moyo is outshining white's.]
;B[pl]LB[rj:B][ql:A]C[Imagist: This is a good moyo-building move, but it's a bit slow; a play at or around tengen would build more.  A play at A also would be better, as this would set up for reduction of white's side with B.]
;W[cg]LB[cf:B][bi:A]C[This is good, aiming at A, but a more conservative play at B would make more immediate profit and still threaten A.]
;B[cl]LB[eg:B][jj:D][nk:C][eq:A]C[If you want to solidify your moyo A would be best.  B, C or D are probably better though, expanding your moyo.  White will be forced to invade and black can take profit by attacking the invading stones.]
;W[ci]LB[bi:A]C[Imagist: A is better.];B[cj];W[ch]LB[bi:A]C[Imagist: Too slow.  A is again better.]
;B[bj];W[jj]C[This is huge, building white's moyo and hurting black's.]
;B[mq]LB[jc:C][lj:B][qo:A]C[Imagist: Too slow.  The best side to develop this corner is at A, but black doesn't have time for this.  Black needs to do something about white's growing moyo.  I suggest B or C, but black's position is difficult here.]
;W[qk]LB[ei:D][qj:B][nk:C][ql:A]C[This is the wrong shape locally.  It black descends to A, white has gained little and lost great potential.  It would be better for white to play at A or B.

However, fighting over a small segment of the side like this is insignificant next to a large expansion like C or D.]
;B[ql]
(;W[dj]C[should i have played this cut earlier?

Imagist: I think it's not so much the problem of whether to play this earlier, but whether this is right.  White is ahead here because he has more potential to reduce black than black has to reduce white.  If black plays like in the variation, black can pull ahead.  It would be better to play as in the variation.]

(;B[ej];W[dk];B[ei]LB[ep:A]TR[dj][dk]C[now black's group is strong, how can i contain it best? the following fight for my weak group was bad, no?

Imagist: This is a possible way to refute white's cut, but it's difficult for both players.  Here I would not worry about the marked stones, but would instead invade at A while it's still possible.]

LB[in:A]C[now black's group becomes really annoying, he can invade deeply

Imagist: Yes, and white's stones are very hard to save here.  I can't find a very good move for white here.  I would try for a deep reduction at A and hope to rescue the stones in the resulting fight.]
;W[gj]LB[fk:A]C[Imagist: This is too much.  The cutting point at A makes this meaningless.]

;B[em]LB[ho:A][hp:B]C[Imagist: Black has given you a golden opportunity to play dual purpose move: a very deep reduction and ladder breaker at A or B.]

Imagist:  White can resign here :).  But to lose by the least margin, probably saving the group with A would be best.  A not only attempts to connect, but provides support for to protect territory at B or reduce at C.]

after this it's mostly done. there are a few mistakes on both sides that result in prisoners and an ill-going invasion by black at J16 (move 179).

The best way to prevent this is with A or B, since playing at the 33 point doesn't really help you much on the sides.]
