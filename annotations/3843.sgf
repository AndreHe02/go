Thanks for doing this review! I took White this game. I seemed to have the upper hand during much of the game, but at the end made a slip and my opponent gained about 6 points in a sente seki.

I didn't have any strategies for this game beforehand, except for the probe at S16 that I always enjoy using. Other than that, I just tried to play sensibly and flexibly.

Also, I didn't really count at all this game (a bad weakness of mine). It always seemed like it was pretty close, though. . .

Aside from the obvious seki, what other mistakes did I make?

Thanks again!

-------------------------------------

ferdi: Hi! This was an interesting game :) I hope my commentary is of some help.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[nq]C[Wedging in the middle at R10 may have been better, but it seemed too predictable. I wanted to do something a little different, keeping S16 in reserve for later.

-----------------------

ferdi: o3 is a fine move :)];B[pn];W[jp];B[qj]LB[pj:A][cn:B]
C[ferdi: I would prefer BA or BB instead.];W[jd]TR[oc][qd][qj]
C[This seems like a mistake. Perhaps the D10 hoshi is better?
Of course, then Black can enlarge his moyo too. Any opinion?

-----------------------

ferdi: Yes, WD10 looks superior. If Black enlarges his moyo, the low marked stones will give White many opportunities to reduce.]
;B[cj];W[cm]LB[cl:A][cq:D][fq:C][lq:B]C[I wanted to enlarge the bigger of my two moyos.

------------------

ferdi: Why not. But, please note that

- WA would be better in my opinion, because there would be more pressure on the black stone.

- this kind of moyo has a lot of weaknesses (B, C, D), so making a smaller moyo with less weaknesses has advantages, too.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[jc]LB[dh:A]C[ferdi: This is strange. Having played B16, Black should continue with the normal move at A.]
;W[ic]C[I wanted to invade at C12, but played this urgent play instead.]
;B[kc]
(;W[kd]LB[id:A]C[This seems like another mistake. J18 gives a more secure territory and possibly sente. With sente I can invade at C12.

----------------

ferdi: Connecting with A would also be fine.];B[ib];W[hc]LB[id:A]
[ch:B]C[This makes white very overconcentrated.

----------------------

ferdi: Yes. I think connecting at A, and, if Black plays at the top, invading at B is better.]
;B[ld];W[le];B[md];W[kf]C[ferdi: Perhaps necessary, but now Black can defend at the left and White's thickness is not very effective.]
;B[ej]LB[dh:A]C[ferdi: Better at A.];W[rd]LB[no:B][eq:A]C[ferdi: Again I would prefer A or B.]
;B[qe]C[White probes, and Black emphasizes the outside.

----------------

ferdi: Giving White the corner looks strange in view of the white strengh at the outside.]
;W[oj];B[qg]C[ferdi: That is Blacks strong position, he should play at the bottom (maybe even q2?) or ignore the white move and invade the white moyo.]
;W[qk]LB[no:B][eq:A]C[ferdi: You don't have to continue here, haveing prevented a good black move here is already a success. Again, A and B look nice :)]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[pl];W[qi];B[rj];W[qh];B[rk];W[pg];B[rg]LB[re:A]
C[Black makes a major mistake--this should be something like S14.

---------------

ferdi: I would play A.];W[qc]C[ferdi: Too early?!];B[pc];W[qb]
;B[sb]C[ferdi: This, of course, doesn't work.];W[sc];B[rb];W[ra]
;B[pb];W[re];B[se];W[rf];B[qf];W[sf]TR[qk]C[ferdi: I don't think that the marked stone was]
;B[ng];W[mj];B[ni];W[nj];B[mm];W[kj];B[lq];W[qq]C[When black invades, it seems simplest to steal the corner and then worry about the outside.

ferdi: I would have played there, too :)];B[pq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr]
(;B[nr]LB[oq:A]C[ferdi: I think A instead is better (see variation)]
;W[ro];B[gp];W[iq]LB[jm:B][jn:A]C[This looks a little slow. . .

-----------------

ferdi: Yes. How about A or B?];B[hr]LB[em:A]C[ferdi: Strange move! Black A looks better.]

;W[ln];B[mo];W[mn];B[no];W[nn];B[oo];W[nm]LB[dq:A]C[ferdi: Not small, but I would prefer to defend the corner with A.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]C[I have nothing to gain from hane-ing on top, so I hane on the bottom.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[eq];W[bk]LB[em:A]C[I settle my shape. . .

ferdi: Hm. To me, it looks as if there is still aji in the black group at the left, so I would prefer simply jumping to A?]

;W[gc];B[bc];W[gb]LB[eg:A]C[ferdi: Looks small to me... How about emphasizing the center with A?]

----------

ferdi: True :)];B[jb];W[cd];B[ce];W[fp]C[ferdi: But this is not good - Black won't play here for a long time (too small), so by playing these kind of sente move this early, you give away good ko threat material.]

ferdi: No? To me, it looks good :)];B[so];W[sp]LB[sr:A][bs:B]
C[Too greedy!

--------------

ferdi: I think this is the mistake? White should play A instead, and then Black B is bigger than capturing at the right.]
;B[sr];W[rr];B[sq];W[ps];B[rs];W[qp]C[So Black gets a sente seki, robbing me of 6 points. . .
