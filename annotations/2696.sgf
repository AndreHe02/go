AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[My opponent is ranked at 17kyu on the British GO Association. He introduced me to GO in April this year and taught me the moves. I am 57, and though i play chess, i am coming to GO late.  We played a few games at lunchtime where he tried to point things out to me and in order to try and improve I have bought a couple of books and looked at Sensei.   Lunchtime is rushed, and so to give me time to think more carefully what i was doing, we played the following game. I received no help/hints/tips durrring the game. I suspect that he took me very casually and it was only later when the game started to unfold, that he upped his ' thinking'. I do not kid myself that this win makes me a good GO player, indeed if the floor on Dragon was lower than 30kyu, then I would be at that floor. And so...this was my first SERIOUS game

******************************
I'll try to do my best to review your game.
My rank in KGS now is 13k. However, rank difference does not guarantee that I can give a good review.

Hereafter, my comment will be marked after '*' separator


Jerry];W[nd]C[Given any large handicap confuses me a little - if only i could place my 9 stones where i wanted i could create my own shamaris and extensions.. as it is, my 'book' opening reading seems a little irrelevant, so i tried to stick to basic principles, Openings then sides.]
;B[pf]C[***********************

Classic opening. R14 is possible.
There is a difference between third and fourth line
Third line emphasise side teritory, while fourth line emphasises centre teritory.
It takes less moves to secure side teritory, and more to secure centre teritory. Imagine completing a box, for side teritory, you've had one made for you. On the other hand, you need to complete ALL sides for centre teritory. Your pick.]
;W[gd]TR[qf]C[************************
Since B has a lot of handicap stones, W usually makes unreasonable moves trying to confuse B, and play LIGHT readily sacrificing stones. (see the description of LIGHT and HEAVY in Sensei)

So standard strategy is to scatter stones around, keeping B busy attacking those stones, while attack other part of the board]
;B[jf]TR[cf][df]C[**************************

An attempt to separate white, nice try, but I will go for side teritory D14 or C14]
;W[df]TR[gd]C[*************************

You should try to separate W's stones here, creating 2 weak groups: Divide and Conquer.
That will keep W busy looking for life on the sides of the board. And you can get profit attacking those groups]

(;B[fd]C[My d16 seemed to be getting isolated.. i note in my play that i do not know how to attack.  I always seem to end up reacting to my opponent, whether i play W or B. My strategy seems to be, try and get a firm foundation, then look to build a moyo. Any attacks are local tactical affairs with no great plan in mind

****************************************
I think this is not a good move. See my variations.];W[fe];B[ee]
;W[fc];B[ed]C[In chess i have learnt that sacrifices rarely pay off. So here e16 was in response to the atari threat

****************************

In go, sometimes you get better result with sacrfice, but I agree that here you should connect. It leaves W with a lot of cutting points]
;W[ge];B[ef];W[cc]C[I am always unsure when to pay a 3,3 invasion when i am White. Having seen Stephen play this, i went into auto response mode]
;B[cd]TR[cc][df]C[**********************************

I think it's a good move, stil separating W's stones];W[di]
TR[cd][dd][ed][fd][ee][ef]C[i had expecxted him to play d17, not launch an attack elsewhere

**************************************
I think this is W's attempt to cut and kill B's triangle group]

(;B[ci]C[***********************************************************

not a good move. Your stone must gain liberty, or try to connect to other group. 
See variation];W[ei]TR[cd][dd][ed][fd][ee][ef]C[*************************

B's triangle group is not save yet. It doesn't have any eyes, and can be cut out completely.]

(;B[md]TR[mf][nf]SQ[pc]C[**************

Again, touching the stone you're attacking. Bad move W will only gain liberty this way.
Triangles are better. 
Square is probably the best. completely secure the corner, gaining teritory, while attacking white.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[pc]C[*****************************************************

I think you can cut W here.]
(;B[od];W[oc];B[ne];W[nc];B[qc]C[I was thinking now that my handicap had given me the basis of a large moyo so, by playing conservatively and soundly, i could protect what i had been given and slowly build and reinforce it. I was looking here to a RHS territory but would have preferred my handicap stones to have been on the third rank as ' the book' tells me that is better for territory and i am not sure how i can convert influence to concrete territorial games.

***********************************************************
Ok, you still secure the corner];W[jc];B[kc];W[kb]

Still triangle needs to run];B[cn]C[Looking to firm up my base

*****************************************************
OK, acceptable, big move. But there is an urgent move (see previous remark). B's group in danger. Although W might not realise this]
;W[gp]TR[dp][jp]C[HELP!  An invasion... now what?  Or should i be looking at it as i have inherited an automatic pincer?

*****************************************************

It's been pincered by triangles.]
(;B[mq]TR[mp]C[So i ignored it and continued to consolidate, and play on 3rd row, looking for territory as mentioned a few moves ago

*****************************************************

since no other W's stone in that quadrant, fourth line is better.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[hq];W[hp];B[iq];W[pm]TR[qj][qp]SQ[ef]C[Another invasion.. i am Black, should not i have the initiative, or be taking it?

*****************************************************

Now is the time to sit back and think.
How many teritory have you secured?
Do you need to attack or defend?

I think you have secured some 25 on the left, some 15 on the bottom. Corner can still be invaded.
W? some 15 on the top. You're winning.
( I believe W thinks your square group is safe for the time being)

You should make defensive attacking move now.

Triangles are the move. They attack W's Q7 base 
With R10, you secure some other 25 points on the right. (questionable, can still be invaded)
with R4, you secure a solid 10 at the bottom.];B[pn]C[*****************************************************

Bad move. Strengthening W.];W[om];B[ph]C[trying to loosely connect my stones, stop any further incursions I was a bit concerned here that i was falling behind. The TOP of the board seems to have been lost tho i have a fractured wall. RHS is loosely in my controlBottom RHC seems a little more solid for me and the rest is undetermined. Looking back now I can see a moyo developing centred on n12.. but i did not see that during the game

It all depends on skill. Strong oppenent migt still reduce/invade your moyo.]

C[Am looking at the board trying to understand what is 'mine', or potentially mine. The joseki around r3 has just swallowed up ( my? )points. Does that l16 wall do anything for me? Now, i can see a space bounded by k10/ r10/ q16/ k16.. but i never considered that at the time. Or, are those boundaries just aspirational and should i have considered focussing effort on them and making it my strategy?

*****************************************************

Of course the L16 wall enclose your teritory.
The boundaries that you mentioned are called moyo. They need moves to be converted to teritory. It can still be invaded or reduced at this point.
You have to look at the whole board again. 

OK, you consider R2 group alive. and you might consider F2 alive as well. but definitely A is not alive yet. You can attack that group while building wall that enclose your teritory around K10/R10/Q16/K16]

Now triangles are dead They go nowhere];W[so]C[i realized AFTER i had played that s8-t8 could be in danger. I was just focussing upon the t7 group..local tactical battle]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[nk]TR[ok]C[Now at last looking a bit towards the centre space

*****************************************************
Ok, I was going to suggest triangle to steal W's eye (see eye stealing tesuji in Sensei). but it's useless now since W has connect to the bottom group]
;W[jh]C[but another invasion :-(

It's just a reduction now. alive or not, depends on both sides L&D skill]
;B[fg]C[*****************************************************

Finally, you notice your weak group];W[hg];B[gh]C[I was bbegining to think here about the need for W to be able to create 2 eyes and was there a way that i could isolate the g16 group, hence g12]

Unnecessary. B is already connected. Other moves on board is better
A will kill W's square group.
B secure some more teritory.
C attacks W's bottom group.];W[lk]C[another surprise..but then all his moves are a surprise as i was not thinking about his moves, just mine.. and so once more i am in reactive mode]
;B[ji]C[creating an atari to give me thinking space, connecting stones and increasing my liberties of tengen]
;W[qd]C[He ignored my threat! And now r17 looks very vulnerable and the top RHC territory is gone. P-Q16 don't look healthy either

They are safe for the time being I believe];B[qe]C[Counter attack]
;W[oe]C[Ignored again!  Why? What was the point of p15?

;W[me];B[nf]TR[me][oe]C[putting p15 into a net, assuming the thing doesn't fall apart by having o14/15 under attack. I did not consider the possibility that they would come under attack but...and so i went for k12

W is desperate. So, he is trying to confuse you and hoping you make a mistake]
;W[mh];B[mi]C[Now, has the white group at n14 got sufficient room to make 2 eyes, or can i go after those as well as the g16 group. That is what i was thinking]

Better ignore, It's worth 1 point only.
consider other moves];W[dm]C[and again.. these seem to me to be local tactical battles.. tho perhaps i can now see a moyo for white emerging centred upon h8]

(;B[jl]TR[cm]C[so, i tried to invade with idea of connecting tengen to k4

There is no moyo to invade here.

Better connect at triangle  or cut the lone stone from the rest of the group, or attack bottom W's group]
