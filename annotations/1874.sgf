;B[pd]C[Hello my nickname is AbyaIail. I'm black and 15-16k
I'd like a review for black, please^^

My yose is terrible can u correct it please.
What is the losing move, I guess it's whan i build the black wall in the north region.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc]C[isn't the right  hand on Q18 for white?

usually first q18, but this is ok too];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]C[Is it right, or must i play double pincer with F17?

it`s ok];W[fd];B[eh]C[I don`t know if this move is so good because leaves cuting points behind you]
;W[ck]TR[ch]C[this white move is not so good also too far from corner and too far from marked stone]
;B[fq];W[eo];B[iq];W[dj];B[hg]C[Is it good for black?];W[hd]

;B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]C[I think until here the exchange is good for Black, may be N8 isn't needed]
;W[ll];B[mh]LB[md:A]C[expansion from the wall and big moyo with the border, that were my intentions, is this stone ok?

If you want a big moyo right move is A  this way you keep white stones low on upper side and build another wall to develop your moyo]
;W[im]C[this move is slack, white group is quite safe and there are a lot of big moves, white just throw sente away]

(;B[dr];W[lj]C[Isn't D2 sente because of the invasion in C3?

The invasion at c3 was posible before d2, see variation];B[mj]
;W[li];B[mi];W[ii];B[fj];W[el]
(;B[cq]C[I think c4 is better white can`t afford to cut you, see var.]
;W[cp];B[bq]C[B4 better?

no you will lose sente, or later white can capture b4 if you tenuki and move elsewhere]
;W[bp]C[here I`ll go for c17 for sure is so big and you don`t have teritory on the left to damage]

(;B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[jd]C[I think it`s  better for you to asure some eye shape for your group on left while reducing and then try invasion on upper side, after your left group is quite safe.
see var.

I was playing quite a lot in those var. but I wanted you to see how can evolve things there, of course there are thousands of variations. However the ideea to get from this is the one above.]
;W[jc]
(;B[je]C[L16 better?
Here my idea was to prepare the connection of left-middle group with the right

if you chose to play k16 then watch for other variation];W[if]
;B[ig];W[jf];B[jg]C[L14 better?];W[kf];B[kg];W[lf];B[lg]C[He]
;W[mf]C[With is the useless wall is was talking about in the intro

if you don`t want things to evolve like this I mean white making a lot of points you should make life on left and don`t connect your groups]
;B[ng]C[P18  is better?
I never found a way to reduce left white border, is there a way?

sure there was a way but now it`s too late for that, I think you already found that way in one of previous var.

And yes, p18 is huge and better for this moment.];W[mg];B[lh]
;W[nf];B[og];W[oe];B[pe];W[hk];B[gl]C[F8 better?

well, g5 is better for sure, expand your teritory and reduces white]

let`s asume you tenuki there, see var.]

no, he is to strong here to do something];W[bh];B[bc];W[bb]

(;W[ee];B[ce];W[qa]
(;B[rb]C[S19 better isn't it?

no, see var.];W[ra];B[kn]C[Is this the biggest move sente?

no, I don`t think it`s sente at all

sente moves are a4, f4, a13
after those moves, comes the big moves at s9 and a18];W[km]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[rk]C[Too little? T9 better?

it`s big yes, but as I said before sente moves first then big but semi-sente(white can neglect your move and move elsewhere in sente and then come back and defend here)]
;W[rl];B[sk];W[sl];B[ap];W[ao];B[aq];W[bo];B[ah]C[this is not good, white didn`t know how to play here, 
see var.

A13 is the right move here and allows you to move at A18, after]

(;W[ai];B[ag];W[bi];B[ej]C[bad?

P16 looks more like sente to me, f4 as I said before and a18 quite big also t18 but this is gote for you so you should play here after]
;W[eq];B[er];W[eg];B[ei]LB[gg:B][fh:A][gi:C]C[bad?

no,  you must defend there, but f12 is better, else you must defend one more time later, because of white f12 which makes B and C miai]
;W[qk];B[rj];W[kh];B[jh]C[always look for sente moves first  and bigger than half point]
;W[ki];B[lk];W[kk];B[mk];W[ln];B[lo];W[od];B[pk];W[di];B[fp]
;W[fo]
(;B[gr]C[no need to defend there
see var];W[ac];B[ad];W[ab];B[dh]C[bad!

glad you can see that, worse is now e9 is sente for white because of f12]
;W[so];B[sp];W[sn];B[of];W[pa];B[sm]C[futile, if he takes snap back but it's stupid to hope a mistake.

what snap back????
you cannot move in any other spot there because it will be suicide and it`s illegal as you know, so you just give white one more point there.]
;W[sb];B[sc]
(;W[sa]C[in the top right corner i just lose 4 points when i didn't played S19, is it right?

I already cleared this thing, and by the way, you could lose more points there because not defended at t18, but white didn`t know the right way.
