AB[dp][pd]C[DC:

Hi, My name is Dylan Carter I am approximately 5k.

I played this handicap game against quite an equally strong opponent.

I am wondering where i could have improved the play in order to capitolise on any weaknesses you can spot.

I didn't find enough weakness.

The time scale was 1/25 in 5.

-->Well, as you say, this is a handicap game against someone pretty close to you in strength -- so, it's less a matter of finding weaknesses than of creating them.  You gave b territory in exchange for a large moyo that was a little too easily invaded, so he had a fairly easy game given the two stone advantage.  You need to use whatever opportunity you have to pressure your opponent; in this case, the key was really the attack on the single invading stone on the left side]
;W[de];B[qp];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[qn];W[jq]C[DC: Played low with focus on the
D4 stone.];B[gq];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[dc];W[fd]C[--> While you do have the two stones at c6, they are a little too far for this to be an effective moyo-making joseki choice -- b gets lots of territory and then gets to play an ideal splitting move on the side.  
  This might be the losing choice for this game, especially since it is a handicap game against someone around the same strength.]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[cd]C[DC: Is D10 playable?

->not really -- b c15 would be too good a response -- then you wind up having to emphasize center-board territory, while b has comfortable postions everywhere.  Once you've played f16, this is necessary.]
;W[ce];B[ei];W[fn]C[==> a very good idea.  However, in this case w f6 is not convincing because although you can rob b of most territory in corner, b can get out or else make eyes, so he can tenuki the corner and reinforce his splitting stone.  On the other hand, it is very hard to find a good move here because b has so much room to play.  You might instead try to lean on the corner in sente with something like e4, b e3, d5, b c4, e4, b f3.  B gets stronger where he already had 3 stones, and then you have a stronger position to attack b's center.]
;B[el];W[cj]C[-->getting rid of b's base a good way to think, but a little late.  Now you traded two corners for low, low territory on the side.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[dj];W[ch];B[di];W[ck];B[gl];W[hn];B[il];W[nc]
C[==>board is already very difficult for w.  Problem is that b's potential on the right side is greater than w's on top, and b is already ahead in territory.  So now that you have h6, this might be a good time to attack b's bottom corner, with just c3 first to see how b responds.  You should come away with sente and a stronger wall to pin b's center against; continue the attack and try to cut something off or make enough strength to create more territory on the right side/middle if possible.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[lc];B[qf]C[-->b lots of solid territory, w without much potential]
;W[hc]C[-->very big, but b's ideal shape on right side much bigger than w's territory on top.]
;B[me];W[le];B[lf];W[kf];B[lg];W[kg];B[pj]C[b very nice now.]
;W[lh]C[DC: I was quite happy with this hane. But felt unable to capitolise fully.

->normally a nice position, but b too strong here for you to do much.  He should ignore and play around h11 to solidify his group and prevent you from making much in the center.]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[nh]C[--> This is an important point: you should definitely ignore this and start your attack on the b group.  B can't ignore your attack on the middle group, and your play here has accomplished its splitting function.  Don't get too attached to these two stones (l12, n11).  Why give b k11 in sente?]
;W[li]C[-->bad move, just heavy and gives b a chance to fortify his weak position.]
;B[ji];W[lk];B[dh]C[>with d12 and k11, b assures himself some breathing room.]
;W[cg];B[bo]C[>big, but risky with middle group not settled.]

(;W[gh]C[DC: Is this a reasonable attacking move?

-- I would go deeper, ranging from h11 to g10.  g10 might look too deep, but see variation for a possible outcome.]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[hh]C[-->b enough ahead to play it safe with h10.]

(;W[ih]C[-->b has too much territory for this otherwise nice ponnuki.  You have to go for the kill, or at least threaten the kill and break off a part of this group.  The right spirit is to play as in the variation.]
;B[hj];W[hg];B[gj];W[eq]C[DC: Invasion, any good?

-->good, just not enough at this point.];B[ep];W[fq];B[fp];W[gr]
;B[gp];W[hr];B[dr];W[qj]C[DC: Sorry, my best shot time.

-->about all you can do now.];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi]
(;B[rj]C[DC: I considered the conter atari but rejected it for hope of an attack of sorts on the corner group.

 -->this b move is terrible -- gives white a chance to come back.  Should just calmly play q9.]
;W[qk];B[qh]C[DC: I couldn't create an attacking situation, but enjoyed the game regardless. End of comments.]
