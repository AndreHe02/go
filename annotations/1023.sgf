C[
 Thanks you for reviewing this game.
 I played white, even game against 10kyu on KGS.

 I was able to find so bad moves but there were mostly tactical errors.  I'll be glad to have
some strategic concepts to help me during the opening and the middle game.]

(;W[qf]C[pem: White should play R6 or Q5. Allowing Black to press down with R5, R6, etc, is painful.]

(;B[qj];W[qm];B[jp]C[
 R4-R7 is weak]
(;W[nc]C[
 Is better r17 ?

pem: It's also a possible, but hard to say if it's better or not.]

 I fell that the exchange was bad for me. He has now both territory on the right side and
influence.

pem: I think it's good for White. He got a fairly large corner in sente, and is
sticking out his nose on the fourth line on the upper side. Black's shape is
too strong and overconcentrated.];W[cf];B[ch];W[fc];B[ee]C[pem: This is a bit unusual. You normally play D14 when you have C12.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[gd]
(;W[dg]C[pem: Better to leave this unplayed unless you intend to continue running with it
(which I don't recommend). It just strengthens Black on the left side. White
might want to play C10 later for instance.];B[dh];W[bd];B[be]
;W[bc];B[bf];W[gc];B[hd];W[gq];B[cl];W[nm]C[pem: This seems a little thin to me. P7 is probably better. Black Q6 looks like trouble for White for instance.]
;B[gh]C[pem: Too close to Black's stones. Better at E8.];W[el]
TR[cn]C[
 Maybe C6 better ? But It still doesn't protect the corner.

pem: C6 would provoke Black E8 and the corner is still not completely safe.
In order to close the corner, C5 is better.
But I think E8 is ok. It's reducing Black's framework, and it's at the spot where Black should have played earlier.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[bo];W[cm]C[pem: D5 instead.];B[bm];W[ck]C[pem: Should be D7.]

;B[br];W[cr];B[bs];W[lp]C[pem: Not the spot. M2 is a posibility, the only problem being that White is a
little thin between R4 and R7.];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[iq]C[pem: This only forces Black to connect where he really likes to connect. It contradicts the M4-L4 moves. Play somewhere else instead. (J17 is pretty big, or P9 maybe?)]
;B[jq];W[jo];B[ip];W[hq];B[hc]C[pem: Big.];W[le]C[pem: Not so big. Perhaps better to reduce around P9 instead.]
;B[mg];W[ed];B[de];W[pk]C[pem: Also good.];B[pj];W[oj]TR[ok]
C[pem: Yes, an overplay.];B[ok];W[pl];B[nk];W[mk]
(;B[nj]C[pem: Should be N10.]
(;W[mj]C[pem: Overplay again, white should pull back with N8.]

(;B[mi]C[pem: Well, N8, as mentioned earlier.];W[li];B[mh];W[io]

;B[fo];W[ep];B[fn];W[gm];B[fm];W[hk]C[pem: Should be G8. The Black stones will live, so the E8 stones are not important. Unfortunately, White has pushed Black straight through an area
where White might have gotter a few points. The center looks big, but it's
full of holes.];B[em];W[dn]

;W[mo];B[on];W[pn];B[om];W[nl];B[nn];W[no]C[pem: Pushing through a bamboo joint is never a good idea. White still has cutting points that will have to be protected eventually. Should probably play M7 now.]
