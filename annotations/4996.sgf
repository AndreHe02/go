AB[pd][dp]C[I played as black.
I did alright this game and I won by a good bit however, I am unable to face this bot even and win. Please give me some pointers to make my play stronger and feel free to show me something I missed or just show me a better move that I hadn't really thought about.

****Thank You For Your Time!!!****

gryn:  Hello, you are quite welcome.];W[cd];B[pq];W[po]
(;B[oo]LB[pm:C][qo:B][np:A]C[I prefer to play this way and the bot usually responds in this way, does this play have any weaknesses that I should know about?

gryn:  I am not familliar with this joseki.  I would say that white will get a larger area this way.

Instead, perhaps A, B and pinches (in this case high pinches like C) would be alternatives.]
;W[on];B[no];W[pm];B[jq]C[This is how it ends up looking in out games. is this move too far, can i stretch it anymore, or is this just right?

gryn:  I feel here that your stones do not have a good relationship.

Please note that K3 would rather be high against D4.  Additionally, you finished last in this joseki (at least white does not have to respond here, though he does choose to).

Also, the corner could still be taken by white.]
(;W[mm];B[ec];W[df]LB[hc:A]C[I probably would have been more comfortable playing e16.

gryn: Your stone is high, so perhaps you are right.  However, playing A is the correct repsonse after your E17 here (so, good!).]
;B[hc];W[dc]
(;B[nc]LB[ed:A][dj:B]C[I don't like playing enclosures unless i do it as a response, i wanted to play around c12 or something but i didn't.

gryn:  There is nothing wrong with playing an enclosure, even with a 4-4 stone.

There are two things to consider at this situation.  One, allowing white to play A is a very large move.  Two, because of one, your move must be very large.

Your enclosure is large.  However, I believe you are correct when you suggest the left side is larger still.

One can compare the number of open lines, the top has 7, the right 8 and the left 9.  Therefore, we could say the left is larger.

I suggest B.  It is very large.  Additionally, it allievates white's A even more than perhaps O17 does.]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[fq]
(;B[eo]LB[cq:A]C[Is this a good sequence, I think it worked out okay for me but are there any weaknesses to it?

gryn: it is worth alot to get out.  In this situation, you could consider A, since you have stones on both sides, and can fight.]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]LB[dm:B][gp:A]C[gryn: generally, this descent is not joseki. it is better to choose A or B and save the cut for later.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dr]LB[dm:A]C[felt like this move was necessary but I kind of lose sente, was it even correct to play the pincer the way I did?

gryn: there was nothing wrong at all with the pincer.  this move would be better at A, white is already alive, it is more important to enclose him.

Remember, that once a group is enclosed, it can no longer contribute to the game.]
;W[cj]
(;B[el]C[gryn:  when you run like this, white may still connect.  When running on the third line, and white is on both sides, it is often best to kosumi first (diagonal).]

(;B[qo]LB[ie:D][of:B][bl:C][qo:A]C[In retrospect, this was very poor play on my part. I can't decide which other move would have been better.

gryn:  The most important thing to do at this stage of the game is to count.  Right now, you can say white has 40ish on the left, and at least 20 on the right.  If you get the entire bottom, that's 40 points, and your top is about 20 points.

This leaves the bottom right corner, and the center as the important points on the board.  Even if you do not gain anymore points, you should limit your opponents ability to do so.

I feel that all of these moves are good, but it is hard for me to choose between them as well.

Perhaps B and C open up the most possibilities, but A gains you a significant number of points.]

;W[lo];B[lp];W[lf]LB[re:A][ro:B][br:C]C[gryn: Your moves here have let white build up, now instead of 20 points on the right, it's 50 points.  Black has gained some as well, the bottom is 50 points, and the top is slightly smaller than the left.  Since there is no komi, it may be possible to play the big end game points and win:  A, B, C.]
;B[oi]LB[li:A]C[this seemed pretty futile, was this suppossed to have been mission impossible and the bot just slipped up when he tried killing it, or is this move alright?

gryn:  This move is not alright unless you cannot win without it.  White should play A and just kill the black stone.]

;W[ph];B[qg];W[lg];B[nf]LB[bl:A]C[could this have worked out better for me?

gryn:  This worked out fantastically.  White gave you an extra move (by playing A).]

;B[pn];W[ds];B[er]LB[pn:A][ds:B][es:C]C[gryn: the move at A is of little value, compare instead the B end game move which is double sente (which means that playing B is a free 4 points).  A requires a followup.  Additionally, E2 should be at C.]

;B[ee];W[dd];B[do]LB[eh:A][el:B]C[lousy play on my part, where is the biggest move right now?

gryn:  Before asking yourself what is the biggest move, you should first count.  White has 45 on the left, no more than 35 in the center.  Black has 50 on the bottom, and nearly 50 more on the top.

Since you have a *very* solid* lead now, it would be best to find places that will simplify the rest of the game.

for instance, you have two floating groups A and B.  This move helps out one of them, so in that sense it is good.  As long as all of your problems seem managable, you should not worry too much about getting more points, and worry more about just finish the game.]

[is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Black wins by 22.5 points.

gryn:  My number one suggestion is to not play bots.  Barring that, please consider basic endgame ideas such as double sente, sente/reverse sente, and (double) gote plays.  If you have a choice between three 10 point moves and one is double sente, the other sente, the last gote, then you may value them at 40 points, 20 points and 10 points, respectively (when deciding which to make first).  If you cannot count the value, simply choosing double sente over sente, and sente over gote is generally good enough.

Last, but not least, your moves should be tempered with your idea of the score.  Count your games.  You cannot decide a strategy without knowing if you are ahead or behind.

Overall, you defeated the bot soundly.  I am perplexed as to why you cannot do so in an even match.  Perhaps in the end you simply need confidence?  I see no reason why you cannot stomp this bot at an even game.  Go for it!

(well, if you *still* insist on playing bots, that is.)

Thank you for letting me review your game.])

I don't like giving anyone an entire side of the board no matter how small it may be.
