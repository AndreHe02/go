C[Thanks in advance for reviewing the game. I am black 17k playing '8-10k' .

Considering the rating difference I didnt feel to bad about this result. But I'm sure there were many errors. I know my early play departed from joseki at a couple of points (since looked up and hopefuly corrected).

I play a very bad (I think) move at B39, and then another at B61, I am particularly interested to hear what a good move at B61 would have been.

Thanks in advance again.

Scr4rM4n.

Note from reviewer:
Move 39 didn't seem too bad but 61 was really a bad one. See the comment.
I hope you'll learn from the review and please don't take my word as the only truth because the truth of a 5k player is not the same as the truth of a dan player.

C[oops. I think that, as white played a large extension at X, you should not come to contact. This will inforce the attached white stone and will make the X stone a good extension.  Consider an extension on the right. at A]
;W[cq]
(;B[cr]LB[dr:A]C[Not good. You cannot let White cut at A. I think you can play at A yourself. (see variation)]
;W[dr];B[eq];W[br]
(;B[fo]C[CUT. see variation];W[cp];B[iq]LB[jp:A][kp:B][pj:C]
C[too low, too close. Consider A or B or even C.

Think again at the beginning, the 4 first move were at the 4 '4-4' points on each corner. This lead to games where influence plays a major role. So use the influence of your 2 stones on both corner.]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[pn:A]C[Wrong side. Better at A. Don't use your influence to build territory (at least, not directly).  Play on the other side and let white live or escape. If he lives, he will have little territory, and if he escapes you will build a big one.]
;W[no];B[qn]LB[pn:A]C[Too low. A is better.];W[pr];B[qq]MA[qn]
C[See how the X stone is now misplaced. Would have been better one space on the left.]
;W[qr];B[pj]C[OK];W[jc];B[mc]C[?
There are bigger points. You should play on the left side.]
;W[gc]LB[je:A][di:B]C[Not very good. May be too low. 'A' build a good moyo. B on the left side seems also good.]
;B[qg]C[No, No, No. Again, don't use your influence to build territory. A move on the left side is now urgent.]
;W[qc]C[Too soon. A move one the left side is also bigger for white.

However, locally, this is a good move because the corner is still open.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]LB[nc:A]C[Bad. You must extend (and connect) at A]
;W[od]C[Of course];B[nc];W[rd];B[oe];W[pa]
(;B[nd]C[The ladder is not good for Black, so I think you have to take. You might have played at A (see variation) but this leave some weak points and white should still be happy.

I don't know why you think this is a bad move (this is B39 for me). The bad move was not 39 but 33.]
;W[re];B[qe]C[Doesn't seem very good. May be just because this is a bad shape.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[og]MA[rg]LB[ph:A]C[This is not coherent with the move at X. you should play at A]
;W[ph];B[qh]C[Again the same bad shape. Avoid this shape as much as you can.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[ng];B[of];W[ni]C[White is happy. Black time is going to be difficult.]
;B[ke]MA[ng][oh][ph][pg][ni]TR[no][nq][pr][qr]C[Dubious. I think Black should try to cut the 2 marked white groups.]
;W[nk]C[Good];B[pk]C[Not many other choice.];W[dj]C[At last. But could be one space above.]
;B[nm]C[Good idea. But seems a little bit late now because white is stronger, has a big influence in the center. Finally, this move leaves many weak points.]
;W[rq]
(;B[mf]C[?? What are you affraid of? This is really a bad move and fortunately, you notice it.

You must answer on the bottom corner. You are giving, for free, a big corner to white.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pq]C[White is very happy with this situation.]
;B[rp]LB[oo:A][po:B][ro:C]C[And is now happier. Should have been at A to build a good shape. You now have 2 weak point (B and C)]
;W[qq];B[mk]LB[jj:A]C[You leave too much weak point behind.  
Secondly, don't come to contact to this group because this will inforce your opponent and will make his job easier either to live or to escape.

What about A?];W[mj];B[lk];W[lj];B[lh];W[kk];B[lm];W[nl];B[ml]

(;B[lo]C[missed the killing stone.];W[ji];B[ih]C[It seems that you love that 3 stones shape. But it is a bad one. I hope that if this review teach you something, it is to avoid this shape.]
;W[fm];B[gm]LB[cc:A]C[Black is now far behind and can no longer win the game as all groups are settled.

He must reduce white moyo by attacking at A but I think this will not be enough.]
