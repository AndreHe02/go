C[i am white.
game won (less than 10 pts), but thanks to magnus's mistake at the end of the game.
w messed a lot with n3 invasion, how can w play this part?

So, particularly interested in invasion and development(timing, execution) review.
I'll do a move per move analysis to spot some tesuji with gnugo after the review, so don't sweat about this!]
;B[cd];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp]C[not used to play diagonal...

JT: diagonal openings are fun, but remember, you can always force a parallel opening.]
;B[ec];W[dj]LB[cj:A][qn:B]C[JT: Good. This is a big point for both sides. Could be A as well, or simply B.]
;B[jp];W[pj]LB[qn:A]C[choice of big moves

JT: personally, I think I'd just play A here, but this is certainly a nice point to have.]
;B[kd];W[md]LB[hc:A][qn:B]C[... option for the corner, not being too far from the corner

JT: Black's previous move seems like an overextension. I'd ignore this and play B now.]
;B[qk];W[qj]C[... to defend from side high right territory invasion.

JT: right. Black's shoulder hit was a bad move, allowing you to push his moyo back. See variations.]

(;B[qc];W[qd]C[...to throw b on the nearest w stone and make a wall for high right territory.

JT: this block is right (proverb: block on the side of the extension).]

(;B[oc]C[JT: this black move is obviously wrong. I'm giving the usual variation.]
;W[pc]C[... testing corner's defense];B[pb]
(;W[rc]C[JT: cutting seems better here. See the variations.]
;B[qb];W[od]LB[qq:A]C[wall better than several corner's points?!

JT: I think yes. Your two stones are in an ideal position. Now you should start to make your own moyo larger and aim for the invasion at A.]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[lc];W[hd]LB[pk:B][qq:A]C[... to not allow b to play here and try invasion/ moyo

JT: this is ok as a reduction, but I think I'd rather start to enlarge the right side moyo now (or just invade at A for instant profit).]
;B[gc];W[hc]SQ[lc][kd]C[JT: good. With the cutting point at N17, this allows you to isolate (and attack) the two marked black stones if he doesn't cover it.]
;B[rb]
(;W[rd]C[... to not let him play at this side of the wall

JT: this is small. I'd cut at N17 now (see variation).];B[sb]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[mb]C[... cut b from the corner.

JT: right. Black shouldn't have allowed this.];B[ma];W[la];B[na]

;B[ic]
(;W[ke]LB[jb:A]C[JT: should be A. See var.];B[jb]C[JT: now black is connected, and the two white stones at H16 have become quite meaningless.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[he]LB[cg:A]TR[dj]C[... aiming center and d10

JT: there is no reason to try to rescue these stones. They're not cutting anything and their position is uninteresting, so they're only a burden. If you want to do something here, A looks more interesting, as it strengthens the triangled stone and also prevents a ladder capture of the two stones.]
;B[ch];W[ci]LB[cf:B][dh:A]C[... prefer defend low right territory, don't like this move!?
 moyo or pincer d14 better? may be difficult before j15?

This move strengthens black, and should in general be avoided. Black usually replies at A. I'd prefer to play elsewhere here, or invade at B.]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[bh];W[dm]LB[dh:A][dq:B]C[... may be difficult if b plays a10. Not so, variant seems ok for w.

JT: I think you should push once at A to reduce black's moyo. If you want to defend, I think B is the best - this move leaves you with no good choices if black invades.]

(;B[di];W[cj];B[ei];W[ie]C[happy to close, allow connect and making eye(s)!

JT: this is too small. You don't need eyes for the wall (attempting to kill it would be a huge overplay).]
;B[jf]C[b sees the danger];W[kb]C[one eye!];B[ja];W[je]LB[le:A]
C[connect and almost 2 eyes

JT: this is two eyes already, as black can't play the eye-stealing move at A. But as I said, there's no way this wall is going to die unless something goes very badly wrong.]
;B[eq];W[ep]LB[dq:A][cr:B]C[.. prefer  limit his territory upwards to protect corner

JT: The last black move was quite odd, and I'd be happy to play A now, to secure the the corner. Black could now slide to B.]
;B[fq];W[dq]C[.. but protect corner

JT: right, this is very big.];B[rj];W[ri]C[... this is w territory!

JT: well, after this exchange it pretty much is, up to the fourth line.]
;B[rk];W[pk];B[pl]LB[ol:A]C[JT: You shouldn't stop pushing here. The hane at A expands your own moyo and keeps your opponent's back.]
;W[mq]LB[hq:B][qq:A]C[... invading,  n4 better for q6 later or ?

JT: if you want to invade here, A is the simplest. If you want to attack black's stones to the left, I think B is best. Since you can't really make two eyes on this edge, this invasion hurts your own moyo.]
;B[nr];W[nq];B[oq];W[mr];B[or];W[mo]C[about k2 better for a base ? o5 better for q6 ou p8?

JT: yes, I'd play K2. You need to settle yourself here, as running upwards hurts your own moyo.]

(;W[lp]C[JT: you're alive, but the invasion has hurt your own moyo badly, and black has become very strong. Also, this move is unnecessary (see var:tenuki)]

(;B[qi]C[JT: see the variations for an endgame technique black should have used rather than this.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[oi]C[JT: right.];B[fm]C[...
sitation not so good. right low corner very big for b, invasion r3 for w
seems unreasonable. invasion n3 only 2 pts and a big wall for b on the left
is a failure.

JT: there's no way you can live in R3.];W[fk]LB[kj:A]C[JT: this side is uninteresting, as black can't create a lot of territory here anyways. I'd play A.]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[fi];W[fj]LB[el:A]C[JT: Should be A to capture.]

LB[fe:B][ih:C][kj:A]C[too small? m12 better?

JT: I prefer A. You can push in around B later if black doesn't shut this, and if he does, you'll play C.]
;B[hi];W[hj]LB[jh:A]C[JT: this side is uninteresting. I prefer A now, to defend.]

JT: it's not so bad. Black let you in very deep in the upper left. Remember, taking away the opponent's territory is often just as good as making territory for yourself.]

(at least at my level) to comment a game like this that has very little fighting, but I think you lost somewhat in the endgame (I think you could have gotten more territory in the center).
