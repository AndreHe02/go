C[Hi, and thank you very much for the review.

I play white in this game.  Throughout the opening, I felt behind, and sloppy.  It may have been the fighting that lost me the game, but I'm most interested in learning how my openings and other influence-moves could be improved.

Jay: Be glad to help.  

This game was lost by W, not in the openning or end game. The main reason for the loss is because W tends to play too thin leaving weaknesses for the opponent to exploit.]

(;W[dp];B[od]C[I had no idea how to approach his corners.  So...I didn't.

Jay: Such unusual openning tries to get you off balance, nothing to be scared of.]

;W[df];B[cd];W[dk];B[ff];W[jl]LB[df:A][pf:B]C[Pretty - but does it make sense? Was I right to let "A" and "B" get surrounded?

Jay: Well, they (A and B stones) are not surrounded yet, but they are too close to the B's strength. It would be better to have Q0, D9 stones a bit closer to help them out (say, Q11 and D11). But, then, K8 stone doesn't make much sense.]

;B[dr];W[er]
(;B[cr]C[Jay: B could do better here.];W[do];B[ap]LB[ch:B][fr:A]
C[Jay: This turns out ok for W. But, B takes all four corners. It's hard for W, unless W develops an effective plan to invade the upper side or corners. But, W has weakness too around A and B.]
;W[pe]LB[qg:B][qi:A]C[I was thinking about "A", with this move.  In retrospect, it seems like he could have just played "B" and I'd have no response.

Jay: The better move for B is R15, as in the game, less aji. S13 also works pretty well. Q15 move is losing point, better not played.]
;B[qe];W[qi];B[mh]
(;W[fg]C[Trying to make my stones work with the left side, and with the center.

Jay: Good thinking, but such contact move is not advicable at this moment.  This is only used when under attack to turn around. This is another thinnly developed move, that is typical of W's style.]
;B[gg];W[fh];B[gh]LB[bg:A][bm:B]C[Jay: These couple exchanges gave B lots of points on the top, while W's gain is small on the left, because B still can invade at A, B.  See my next variation on the next move. The next move is a risky move by W. The proper move is the variation.  But, even then it is possible for B to invade.]

Jay: W is hopeless.  The problem is that W's group at C12 need one more move to extend its liberty. But, W has no time for that, because of the weakness around B7 and E3.]
