C[Hi
Thanks that you are watching my match.

Thanks for the opportunity.
I went through the game once and I can't find serious mistakes. Good!
I think you played a good game, better than you seemed to think during the game. 
You lost the game in  the endgame.
The first advice from  me  is obvious: Count
(This is also my fault many times not counting)
There are also some mistakes in  the endgame. 
Be aware: There is no territory in the center.];B[pd]C[SimonM [6k\]: hi]
;W[dp]C[SEBSEB1 [6k\]: higg];B[pq];W[ed];B[qk]C[I think its my first time i played a chinese opening, it would be helpful if u add variations how to continue on some normal attacking moves.]
;W[jp];B[qo]C[g4: Slight mistake. R5 is  low and R9 is also low.  So  there will not be a lot of territory.
Alternatives are M4 or K17.];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[g4: I would like to block on the other side.];W[qd]
;B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[nd]C[g4:  solid but a little slow]
;W[dj]C[Its difficult for me to choose how to attack or invite the big influence of white because he always get territory on the other side.
g4: This  is the idea  of  the chinese opening. But there is nothing wrong with your approach. He will  get territory, but you cant't get everything. You  may decide to invade at C3  first then at C16.]
;B[qh]C[So i keep away :D
g4: A little too  early. You might want to play P13 or Q13 instead of S12. That seemed to give you a big  moyo too.]
;W[rf];B[cd]C[I think a good move,
g4: Of  course. But you  should  be careful to  retain  sente to play a  move aroud P13/Q14. As long as there is a hole  it is difficult to build a moyo.]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[but a bad follow up.];W[dd]
(;B[bd]C[g4: This seems too easy for white.  Why not C18?];W[db]
;B[bc];W[cb];B[cg];W[ci];B[bh]C[very little move but iam fearing a cut if i jump out or w take my whole base and get much more profit.
g4: Good move! Making a base. Jumping out maybe  good also, but it may be a wasted move.]
;W[jc];B[fc]C[g4: Good counter. K17 was slightly an overplay.]
;W[ec];B[hc]C[g4: Good.];W[fb];B[id];W[hb];B[gb];W[ga];B[ib]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[gb]C[g4: ? F16 of course!];B[ic]C[g4: Good result for black.]
;W[cq];B[bi]C[Bad move -.-
g4: Yes. This had to be at least at  B10.
But I would prefer M3 or M4. A move like D7 is also possible cutting white into two. After D7 white's D10 group  has difficulties.]
;W[bj];B[jf]C[I want to get territory and take the aji. Is there an other possibility?
g4: First of all I don't see much of aji there. (Perhaps I am blind).
Second, as there is still the hole at Q13/14 you will not gain much.
Starting a moyo with M4 seems easier.];W[pg];B[ph];W[og];B[nf]

[sr][qs][rs][ss]C[That should be my move. Now is black with near 20points behind, am i right?
g4: Now let's count. It's a littel difficult. But count only absolutely secure territory. I markes with circles and triangles.
So black has 5+20+13=38,
white has 5+7+14=26.
On the lower left part of the board, there will be more white territory. If you invade/reduce around G4 or D7 white will get territory on  the other side. But it will be no more than 20 points. And white will get a weak group.
And if you play around P5 there is no more the invasion point at  R7 and you get another 20 points. So I think you are leading.]
;B[no]C[g4: Great! Nearly 15 points more.];W[jn]C[now i must try something or it is to late
g4: It's not too late for D7, also I would place it at D8 now (away from strength).]
;B[ck]C[g4: Risky. White may answer at D9.]
(;W[cj];B[dn]C[g4: I would prefer direction to  the center like F8.]
;W[eo]C[g4: You are lucky. What about  F7?];B[en];W[fn];B[do]
C[F7 is better because then i have the chance to cut white later, but i dont like to run without a little base. Is D5 a very bad move?
g4: I don't see a threat by this move. So white may play F7. If he does,  this will be very difficult for black.]
;W[fo];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[dk]C[Really nice opponent  =D
g4: You are no  more weak here White's 5 stones seem weaker than yours.]
;B[dl]C[g4: Solid];W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[gl];W[hm];B[ek]C[Should i jump out directly or maybe E13?
Looks like it is a good running battle for me.
g4: This is a good move. It gives you eyeshape. When you are strong you can attack freely.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[am];B[ak]C[g4:  E12 maybe better. This forces white to make 2 eyes. Then you can expand your moyo with K9.]
;W[bk]C[g4: Better at A10.];B[aj];W[an]C[g4: Bad, driving you into white's territory.]

(;B[bo]C[g4: I think  B4 would be a little better.];W[bp];B[ao]
;W[dh];B[dg]C[g4: Slow and does not make any territory. Better at E14. That maybe makes territory using your J16 group.]
;W[eh];B[ej];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee]C[g4: Better at D14.];W[fe]
;B[ce];W[ge]C[g4: Great. Protects both cutting points. If you had played D14, white didn't had this possibility.]
;B[he];W[fd]C[g4: Unnecessary];B[hh]C[What is a good peep which take more advantage?
g4: Seems good to me.];W[fg]C[g4: Better at G13];B[ng];W[oh]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[oj];W[nh];B[mk]C[Wrong side.
g4: Difficult. I think it is always difficult to make territory in  the center. So good moves seem to be on the sides as O2. But also M5 before N9 seems good.]

Just helps white getting stronger.];W[lh]
(;B[bb]C[g4: Not so big
Bigger are S13, O2, M5, which all heve follow-ups. M5 seems absolute sente.]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[mg];B[lf];W[oa];B[na];W[pa];B[nb]C[g4: Should be at M19, as you can expect White's J19  move soon.]

g4: You could try M8. It's difficult for white, but for black also, so your move is ok.]

Count again:
White: 6+1+8+43+4prisoners=62.
Black: 9+3+20+32=64.
I think with O2 now you will  win.];B[ik]C[What is the biggest move now?
