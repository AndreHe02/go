GC[W4 is not recommended because it gives B the perfect approach move at D15 which plays perfectly with the D4-Q4 formation.]


C[EmTom: Hi thanks for reviewing this game. ;) I'll be grateful for as many comments on strategy as possible. One will improve reading if he plays a lot but good strategy is much harder to learn ;) Also pls add few comments about who is leading when you think that it is important to consider it.

I also would like you to focus on the bottom side reduction (i probably could have done it much better) for a bit and show me few possibilities and ideas (unless of course invasion was a mistake).

Thanks in advance.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dc]C[W4 here is not recommended because it gives black the perfect approach moeve at D15 -- giving B perfect shape with the ni ren se 2-star point opening.]
;B[nd]C[B5 is the wrong direction -- see prior comment.  Build from your star points -- especially when you can play a double-sided move like D15 -- both an approach and an extension.  This move is just an approach.]
;W[nc]C[Playable, but giving B what B wants -- a high position from which to command the center.]
;B[mc];W[oc];B[md];W[pf];B[ic]C[This B11 is joseki, sort of.  But W gets a largish corner and B hasn't played consistently to look to taking the center.  B should play higher here or even think of something around O13.  Probably J16 is about best.  W should be satisfied with this result, though W6 was probably not the best play -- not wrong though.]
;W[cn]C[w12 -- hard choice.  Since one can't know yet what is best over there, I would either play K3 to keep the game from becoming a big moyo game or approach on the right.  Here, B should pincer creating a big moyo on the bottom and the strong top group will keep W from getting much on the left side and the strong bottom will keep w from getting too much on the right.]
;B[fp]C[The one-point jump is never wrong -- so goes the go proverb-- and this is an illustration of where perhaps the proverb is wrong -- -- The pincer is significantly better -- around D8 or 9 -- playing high.  Or the attach and extend joseki at D6 builds the great wall on the bottom.]
;W[bp]C[This can't be too bad, since it is joseki here, but the pull back to D10 making a large framework along the left is probably better.  W then has the strong, large position in the upper right and a large framework on the left (incomplete as of yet) and B13 starts to look cramped.  Now W will make 13 into a pretty well-placed stone.]
;B[jp]C[EmTom: Ok this is a bit new to me... didnt know what to do about the bottom so i decided to leave it for now. Maybe it was better to invade (cut?) b to stop him from securing big territory?

Omigoshi:  This is consistent with a big framework strategy.  B now wants to play on the right side to complete the framework.  W has miai on the left -- either take the corner or extend along the side -- so play there is not urgent.

Look for the only two-edged move for white --  and extension along the right -- which could be an approach move or a checking move -- you could come all the way into Q6 and then pull back to Q9 or 10; or you could almost seal your side with Q10 and then approach or reduce or invade the bottom at the right time.  Or you could even take the 3-3 point in the lower right since the B wall is not worth quite so much given W10.  But the best would be soemthing around Q10 or R10 or R9 (a bit of an overplay).  I would play Q6 in this position.]
;W[qn]C[This is the right direction -- I would play high, here, at Q6, however.  Your instinct was right, though.]
;B[nq]C[Send B a thank-you note for this --- far too defensive.  Nowyou can play P16 and build a much larger framework.  Or pull back to R9.  The dive into the corner works here ok -- but is less consistent.]
;W[rp];B[ci]C[The point now is to get to Q10 before B does.  So, play to get sente.  Since 19 is so far away from both corners, it threatens neither one.  And since if you approach it from one group or the other, B will extend toward the other group, B has miai here and you can' tell yet which way to play.  So take your sente now and play Q10 or maybe Q9 or R10.  I actually like R10 best as being more solid and putting W well ahead with no weaknesses.]
;W[ce]C[Now B should take Q8 or Q10 or some such -- the W move does not threaten the b stone at all -- it still has miai along the sides and can run to the middle.]
;B[cl]C[But B gets this forcing move first, if B wants -- W must defend the corner -- but must try to leave with sente to  get to that point on the right side]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[qj]C[good play here.  W is ahead -- about 60 points to about 50.  B's low position on the bottom is now exposed as being indadequate.

B still has many chances to make the game complicated and reverse the situation since B is strong everywhere, but W is ahead.]
;B[qq];W[pl]C[EmTom: This is probably too slow for now right? Any better ideas?

Omigoshi -- W is far enough ahead that this is playable -- though it gives up about 5  points.

Better would be P6 -- constraining b's development and making your side framework larger.

Also, solidifying your upper left by extending to C13, making B's right side group respond -- is very large -- But leaving the space between 16 and 26 unprotected would not be wise or necessary -- so you played to improve the correct area -- just not the best move.]
;B[cr];W[br];B[cp];W[bq]C[capture!  This mistake costs at least 5 points.]
;B[dn]C[good move.];W[cm]C[Ouch!  You are making B stronger -- given B a wall and having B connect up his groups.  And taking away one of your own liberties, etc., etc.

Part of your problem here is that you did not capture the B29 stone with W32.

I think the simple B7, painful as it is, is best.  Though if I were playing, I would probably play the attachment at E8 -- though that is a tough fight.]
;B[dm];W[dl]C[EmTom: This cut is bad or I just didnt use it correctly?

Omigoshi:  This cut is a bit panicked.  You have larger moves.  Remember, you can use W28 on Q8 to keep B's wall in check.  so you can just take some points along the side with the simple B8.  

Playing 36-38 is fine, but perhaps it even makes sense to just cut and then play elsewhere to use the stone as a sacrifice later.  You cannot capture or kill black and you don't want to create a running group you cannot let go yet.

Moves like D13 or G17 or O6 or K8 or O14 are very, very large.

The cut is not wrong -- probably right.  And 38 is not wrong, but let's look at 40 .  . .]
;B[ck];W[el];B[fm];W[ej]C[Now what?  Instead of a single stone to sacrifice, you have strengthened B with 39 and made it more expensive to lose your stones -- so you want to save them  -- and so 4 looks good -- but where can it run -- just to those strong, grinning black stones on the top.  

So 38 is pretty much wrong and 40 really is.  You are not yet behind --  it is about even now.

But in truth, many players would play as you did -- and I am probably one of them in an actual game -- it is playable.  But it induces great pain in the next few moves . . .]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg]C[No.  You must capture here and end the bad aji of the corner.  THen fight and run either to the top or to the right side with  your group.]
;B[cf];W[df];B[be];W[cd];B[di];W[ei]C[You should now thank black for giving you strength and not attacking your still not fully alive corner.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[nm]C[EmTom: Ok this is where i felt that i already lost the game... Blacks frame seems very nice and way too big. What can w do about it?

Omigoshi:  B got to this point first -- but B is not that far ahead.  Count the points.  B has 58 points on the bottom, 12 on the left, 15 on the top -- 85 points.  

W has 52 on the right, 8 in the left lower corner, 15 in the upper left corner -- 75 -- and a wall worth at least 15 points.  So it is very close -- with B a little ahead on the board, but with W having good prospects yet.

So what do you need to do?  Reduce B's framework while expanding your own.  What move seems to do that?

Well, a shoulder hit at H16 gives W a bunch of points.  A cap at J15 does so as well.  So do moves like O9 and O14.

But they don't affect the bottom.

So, something like G8, G9, H9, K8, K10, all look to expand W while limiting B.  

There are  nastier moves like K7, L5, O6, and so on, but those lead to complicated fights.  If you were really behind or futher behind, those might be needed. 

Here, I like K8.  Then wait and see what B does.  

YOu need to keep an eye on the big scale here.  B at K8 really does eliminate W chances to develop and solidify everything -- the go proverb -- my opponent's best move is my best move -- applies to this sort of situation.]
;W[lp]C[See prior analysis.  Too deep, too desperate.  The shoulder hit at L5 or, if you want to come in this deep, the attach at L4 are the right ways to play -- in this sort of situation, attach is best -- or the shoulder hit which is almost an attachment.  Now B can seal you in and ravage all W spaces . . .]
;B[ko];W[no];B[on];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[ll];W[oo];B[po];W[pn]
;B[ol];W[nn];B[om];W[lo];B[kq];W[kn]C[B should never have allowed W this much development -- and even now it is still dead.  But notice how even if W lives, W's prospects for points anywhere in the middle have evaporated.]
;B[kl];W[kp];B[jo];W[lq];B[kr];W[nr];B[or];W[oq];B[mr];W[np]
;B[ns];W[mq];B[pr];W[km];B[oh]C[EmTom: Ok Im alive here so I reduced blacks bottom a bit but black got quite a nice influence and has another frame. How to continue?

Omigoshi:  Look at your  points now.  B is now ahead by a good solid 10 points as a result of your "successful" invasion.  B should now get the points in the center and reduce W even further.

So you need to play a bit improperly to try to recover. This means tossing some stones around and hoping B plays too conservatively or makes some mistake.  So a forcing stone like at O9, H16, and then J10 gives W some chances.

Or what I would do -- Look to attack the new B group and the stone at P12.    Make B defend these two groups from the direction you want and you could get a lot of points back.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[pk]C[86 is ok -- but 88 makes a mockery of it o-- you must play P10 here to keep the pressure and to build complexity.]
;B[oj]C[Now B is completely settled in the middle and W's position is nearly hopeless.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gd]C[Again, you need to get every point -- so hane at G17  is proper here. Or even better, something lose, but big like K11.]
;B[ig];W[lr];B[ls];W[ii]C[Play the move K15 first -- to cut 93 from the upper group -- separate, separate, separate.]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf];B[if];W[ie]C[Since this was readable from the beginnin, 100 and 102 can't be too valuable -- unless you can rescue them.  So 100 maybe was in the wrong place --   consider the peep or K15 . . .]
;B[kf]C[Connect and say "thank you "  B has just made it a 10 point game . . . .]
;W[je];B[qi];W[rj]C[You need to hane here.];B[qh];W[rf];B[jn]
;W[jc]C[good.];B[jb];W[kc]C[What happens with the hane of L18 instead?  I think it works for W]
;B[kb]C[W];W[lb]C[if you are going to play here, N18 is the move . . .  But since nothing good comes of any play here, leave it for now.]
;B[mb]C[EmTom: I spent some time here. I thought maybe i can do sth useful but couldnt find the way. Thats why i defended the corner. Feels a bit passive though. Was there anything better?]

Omigoshi:  Let's look at the board globally right now.  Compare the success of your invasion with the points B got and W got in the center as a result of your "success."

B got 13 points plus the value of the walls extending further toward W power than they probably could have otherwise.  W got 20 points, plus lost 15 points (at least) on the right.  

The invasion reduced B by 25 points.  Just counting the 13 in the center and the 15 reduction on the right we have a loss for W of 28 points for a net loss of at least 3 points fo W.  Add to this the loss of the two B stones at J11 and J12 (that was a 12 point loss all by itself) and the lack of getting anything in the upper left corner, and you can see how close the game was.  Just htink if W stops b in the upper left corner and gets 5 points -- that is a good 12 point swing right there.

So, in short, W was closer than you thought you were and you could have even won in yose even with the ill-advised invasion.  (but yose is tough to handle, really).  And with just one earlier move on the right-center, you solidify yourself, reduce B and make B the one who must attack agressively.

This game shows many points where W (and, for that matter, B) could have played on just a bit larger scale and simplified his or her task immensely.

Add to all this that W should not live with that invasion, and the value of a simple move that reduces or limits B and expands W should be apparent.

Good luck on your future games.])
