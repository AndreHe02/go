C[Hello reviewer, please review for both sides. My main area of concern for this game is mainly in how I dealt with his Moyo, though the problem probably came from a weak opening. I got into a lot of trouble trying to reduce/invade his moyo. Though I won, looking through this game I realize I probably should have lost. Any other suggestions as to how to improve my game would be greatly appreciated.]

(;W[nc]C[I've never been good playing against the Chinese fuseki. I tend to approach here to delay the fighting in the lower right, which tends to get complicated.

XCM: Yes, the chinese opening is a tough nut, isn't it? But there are many ways to respond, and you don't really have to get upfront and personal. See variations.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[fc];W[hc]LB[od:A]C[XCM: Just a reminder that the cut at A is possible.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[dc];W[ed]C[Would it have been better to play C17 immediately?

XCM: I think this is good. You make yourself a little stronger, force black to choose between connections, and C17 reinforces the corner for you.]
;B[fd];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[jq]C[Looking back, my move here looks a little too passive

XCM: Whole-board wise, i don't think this is a bad move. It would obviously be bad if you allowed black to take this point. However, an high assault at P6 is still preferable in my view.]
;B[mq];W[jo]
(;B[fp]C[XCM: OK, since i'm reviewing for both sides, i'll start here. Black should probably play at D9 instead. K3-K5 formation is just a bit harsh on him to allow entry at F4.

(;W[ql]C[This was probably a blunder, but his moyo is starting to look a little too big.
