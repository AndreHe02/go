C[R: Hi, i'm Davide from Italy, i hope to be useful
My comments are marked by R:
For any question you can find me on KGS as Wiles

P.s. sorry for my bad English];B[ee];W[cg]
(;B[df]C[Attacking straight away, hopefully in sente, as I would then be able to take the top right corner.

R: Good idea, but maybe not the best move for this purpose
D4 is not bad in itself, but if you really want to take sente, you must be more forceful
Playing a contact play like D3 for example.
This may lead to a diffcult fight tough, so you must be careful]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[eh];B[fg]C[Helps me secure some of the right side while attacking.]
;W[be];B[cd]C[Of course, the hane at C6 would have been huge for White.]
;W[gc]C[He took sente, but I still had some attacks on the lower left.]
;B[gd]C[I felt that there was more potential for territory on the right side, and with G6 I was pushing him towards my stronger side (the two stones at C5 and C6).]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[R: Good move, forestalling W H6 is big];W[hb]
;B[hd];W[cb];B[fh]C[R: The top is more urgent
you cannot let white connect all his groups with B6

Simply playing B6 would be better, but there is a lot of aji, so pheraps there would be an even better move, its difficult to say]
;W[dg];B[eg]C[Got territory in gote.

R: Small. Playing at the top is still better];W[bd]C[R: Huge]
;B[cc]C[R: Bad, this let W connect all his stones with B8];W[dc]
C[R: B8 was the move, here W is giving a chance to B
There is the aji of a placement at E8 for B to aim at now
Now C7 has become a good move for B];B[bc];W[dh]C[R: W shoud have defended at the top...]

(;B[bb]C[R: Maybe the losing move...
Here Black had a way to crush white...
See var starting from E8];W[db];B[ib];W[ha];B[ad];W[af];B[ca]
;W[da];B[ba]C[Gote again, but what wasn't?];W[fi];B[gi];W[ei]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[gh]
(;W[bh]C[Was this needed? And if so, could I have invaded instead of Black 39 at G2?

R: I think this wasn't needed. It is worth only was point, since it allow White to answer A7 at A5.
But then W lose a point at F5 so the score doesn't change];B[fd]
;W[dd];B[de];W[fb];B[ac];W[ae];B[ic];W[tt];B[ia]C[Incase he saw a risk that I couldn't see.]
;TW[ea][fa][ga][eb][gb][bf][ag][bg][ah][ch][ai][bi][ci][di]
TB[aa][ab][id][fe][ge][he][ie][ef][ff][gf][hf][if][gg][hg][ig]
[hh][ih][hi][ii]C[White: 14 territories + 0 prisoner + 6.5 komi = 20.5
Black: 19 territories + 0 prisoner = 19
Result: W+1.5

R: I think there wasn't such a big difference in strengt between the two players
Black's only fault was his unability to punish W at E8, and pheraps this decided the game

My suggestion is to train as much as you can with Life & Death and Tesuji problems

I hope to have been useful to you
Best regards, Davide])
