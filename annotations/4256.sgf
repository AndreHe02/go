C[Hello, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I will review this game as requested by black. I'm only a 13k player myself so don't take my advice as absolute thruth.

I have marked my further comments with a J. If I use some terms which you do not know you can look them up at http://senseis.xmp.net/]
;B[qp];W[dc];B[pd];W[co];B[oq];W[dq];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[dd]LB[cf:A]C[J:The opening so far looks quite good. This move however leads to the very complicated avalanche joseki. It would be more simple to play at the point marked A (see the varation)]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[cc]
(;B[db]C[J: Your oponent has chosen a simple varation by connecting with the last move. However this move should really be at D14. See the varations for this move and the next.]

(;W[cb]
(;B[ea]C[Ellisdee: At some point in the last 3 or 4 moves, I feel I should have went for C 14, or perform a tesuji. However, I was stubborn and went for the wall. It still seems like it would have been stronger to move away.

J: If you wanted to play C14 you must do so before playing D16. D14 however still seems to be the right play right now (see the varation)

E18 is also a much better point if you want to defend the cut. Now there is a smalll weakness at F18.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[dg]C[J: your opponent could have been more forcefull with E13. But even this is also good for white. You still have to defend and by doing so you gave white quite a bit of territory.]
;B[eg];W[di]
(;B[eo]MA[jp]C[Ellisdee: I'm thinking now that I should have played closer to E8 or E8 itself in order to cut this, as I don't feel that move gained me much in retrospect.

J: This move is meant to reduce white's potential in this area. For instance if white would have a stone around the cross this move would be a good way to reduce white.

Right now you don't have to worry about reducing white. It is better to build something for yourself. Take a look at the varations.]
;W[dn];B[em];W[cl];B[dk];W[cj]C[J: Your last three moves have given your opponent even more territory while your three stones aren't doing a lot. Q10 is still an awesome point right now]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[ej];W[eh];B[fh];W[dl];B[ei];W[gq]
(;B[go]C[Ellisdee: Should I have cut at E3 or somewhere similar? I got a feeling of running and loss of control, and a loss of strength with my E5-E7 stones.

J: Cutting at E3 doesn't work. A two space extension on the third line such as G3 can't be cut normally (see the first varation).

It's true that your E5 and E7 stones aren't very strong at the moment. However your opponent can't simply capture them (see the second varation)]
;W[kq]
(;B[mq]C[Ellisdee: Am I correct in thinking I should have played at N4?

J: Your opponent took a good point with L3 but around Q10 is definatly the biggest area now.]

(;W[ko]MA[iq]C[J: Your move at N3 made the cross a good invasion point which white now defends. White should have played at R10 instead]
;B[km];W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[io];W[hp];B[im];W[jn];B[kn];W[jo]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[gp];W[jp];B[hl]C[J: You have now made a huge moyo but you can't expect such a big moyo to just turn into territory. White can easily live on both the top and the right.

There is a proverb which says "the corners are gold, the sides are silver and the center is grass". This proverb means that it's easier to make territory at the corners and sides then it is in the center. Therefor any of your last 8 moves would have been better placed at Q10.]
;W[ep];B[lo];W[jm];B[jl];W[gn];B[hm];W[en];B[fn];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[fp]C[J: You don't have to save all your stones. Try to take big points.]

(;B[fm];W[do];B[dm];W[cm];B[dh];W[ch];B[eh];W[ek];B[dj];W[ci]
;B[el]C[J: Again capturing this single stone isn't worth nearly as much as a play around Q10]
;W[qj]C[J: And now white beats you to it. This is an excelent move by white.]
;B[ql];W[qg];B[re]C[J: Defending the corner is a good idea.]
;W[rf];B[qe];W[pk]
(;B[ol]C[J: White's group isn't completly safe yet but your attack is probably from the wrong direction (see the varation)]
;W[ok];B[nk]C[J: you are leaving a scary amount of cutting points. See the varation on the next move]

(;W[nj];B[mk];W[kc]C[J: Another painfull invasion]
(;B[hc]C[J: This move is from the wrong direction. Your wall is very strong you should use it to attack white. Now you are just making a little bit of territory while white can settle himself. See the varation.]
;W[nd];B[oc];W[nc]
(;B[nb]C[J: You should try to split white apart. That way he has to make live for both groups seperatly which is harder. See the varation]
;W[ic];B[ib]C[Ellisdee: I'm thinking I should have went to J16 or H16 and protected my center moyo. J18 and O18 end up gettting cut and reducing the effectiveness of my stones (although I do connect them much much later)

J: The move you played tries to destroy white eyespace which is a good idea of course. But because white can easily connect his two groups around O13 they aren't in that much danger any longer.]
;W[jb];B[id];W[jd];B[jc];W[ke];B[je];W[ic];B[cg]C[Ellisdee: This ko started a long series of kos that would form along that center line. I win most of them by threatening white's C11 group repeatedly; did I lose points during these kos?]
;W[cf];B[jc];W[kd]
(;B[kb]C[J: It might be better to play at K15. This protects your cutting points in case white wins the ko aswell as seal of the center.]
;W[lb];B[ja];W[oe];B[mj]C[J: K14 looks better because of the weakness there]
;W[jf];B[if];W[ie];B[he];W[ig]C[J:This is a very dangerous ko for black. But white hasn't got that much to lose. Those kind of ko's are the ones you should avoid.]
;B[je];W[kg];B[hg];W[ie];B[bj];W[bi];B[je];W[ih];B[hh];W[ii]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ij]C[J: Good, you can't let white get away with everything of course.]
;W[jj];B[ik];W[nh];B[ji];W[ki];B[jh];W[jg];B[kj];W[kh]C[Ellisdee: There was no way to make that cut work at that point in the game, and I'm thinking playing at L11 from the start would have been a much better move.

J: Yes that is definatly the case.];B[kk];W[mi];B[rj];W[rk]

(;B[ri]C[J: Cutting is normal in these cases. See the varation]

(;W[qi];B[qk]C[J: even though you got away with this there is still a big weakness left at Q8. See the varation.]

(;W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[qh]C[Ellisdee: This was definately too greedy; if I had played S12, or even more conservatively, S8, he wouldn't have as much strength for when white played R6

J: patching up the weakness of Q8 looks like a good idea.];W[rh]
;B[ph];W[sj];B[rl];W[si];B[pf];W[pg]
(;B[ni]C[J: huh? P10 catches a single stone. See the varations for a couple of ideas on the endgame]
;W[oi];B[qf];W[oh];B[sf]C[J: You have missed a good chance here to poke inside white's territory. See the earlier varation and the varation on the next black move.]
;W[sg]
(;B[rg];W[pi];B[sh];W[of]C[J: This is a big point.];B[sg]C[J: Connecting the ko is gote and not worth a lot of points. N18 ans C19 look like good plays.]
;W[qn]C[J: This is a complete overplay by white.]
(;B[rn]C[J: however this move isn't a good attacking move. This move is a contact move. Contact moves tend to make both sides stronger. Therefore contact moves are great for defence but not so good for offence.

If you want to attack you normally should do it from a little distance. That doesn't strenghten white and makes the eye space smaller.

You should simply patch up your weakness at Q8 now and white will have no chance of living.]
;W[ro]C[J: Look, with this move white really hurts your S6 stone and becomes stronger while doing so.]
;B[sm];W[on];B[qo];W[po]
(;B[qm]C[J: better fix your weaknesses.];W[pm];B[pl]C[J: Now white forces you around because of your weak points.]
;W[op];B[pq];W[nm];B[om];W[no]
(;B[mm]C[J: You could still have killed the white group here. See the varation]
;W[lp]C[J: Again you can still just cut of white. The atari that will follow won't hurt you. See the varation]

(;B[mo];W[mp]
(;B[pn]C[J: you still had a final chance to get it all. Look at the varation.]
;W[np];B[nl];W[mn];B[ln];W[nq];B[or];W[nn];B[pp]C[J: This move is really small. N18 is worth much more.]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[lm];B[kl];W[ml];B[mm]C[Ellisdee: I think white missed the snapback, but it was too little too late. There should have been a way to defend the white attack, but I'm not sure what path would have worked better for that. I'm still not very good with deep invasions like that.]
;W[oo];B[la];W[ma];B[mb]C[J: playing N18 first is better.];W[ka]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[la];W[lc];B[na];W[mc];B[bl]C[Ellisdee: From here, even rough counting, I thought I was at least 20 points short, if not more. I wouldn't say this cut was desperation, but I wasn't entirely confident that it would work]
;W[aj];B[bm]LB[bn:A][cn:B]C[Ellisdee: White's response to this surprised me, I expected whut to connect with C6

J: Yes connecting is the right move. White probably missed the atari.]

(;W[bn];B[cn];W[am];B[cm];W[al];B[bo];W[an];B[ao];W[ak];B[cp]
;W[dp];B[bq]
(;W[fo]C[J: White gave you a chance here.  C2 would have killed you. See the varation]
;B[cr];W[cq];B[bp];W[dr];B[bs];W[ds]LB[ar:A][cs:B][ms:C]
(;B[ar]C[Ellisdee: I'm worried that here another move may not have been necessary, it could have waited, or maybe I should have played C1. Regardless, keeping life here made me feel confident I would win now. Playing it out now; I realize I had enough liberties to keep life in gote.

J: No this move is necessary, see the varations.];W[gn];B[gm]
;W[go];B[cs]C[Ellisdee: This is a useless move, in retrospect; but I was fearing losing that small group.

J: Yes C1 is answered by B2. This move does make that extra point at B2. However it is a very small move. C19 looks like the biggest move.]

C[J: B+18.5


Well this is the end of the game and my review. Here is my overall advice.

In the opening it is important to remember that the corners are biggest next sides and then the center. Your game was focussed on the center to much but you made your moyo so big that your opponent lived easily. Try to look at the whole board and find the biggest point to play.

When dealing with invasions there are a few things to remember. You should try to keep your opponents groups separated if he invades at two points. This way both groups will need to make to eyes seperately instead of togther. Also remember that contact plays make your opponent stronger and that attacking from a distance is often better.

In the endgame also try looking for the play which is worth the most points. You should play sente moves before gote moves.

My final advice is to do lots of tsumego (go puzzles). Those really help when it comes to killing or making life for groups. You can go to www.goproblems.com and solve tsumego online. Doing tsumego frequently can really improve your game.


I hope my review has been helpfull.])
