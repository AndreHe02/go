C[This is my game icedrake (13k) against isuy (13k) on IGS. I played white.  I made some major errors in this game and finally lost.  Apart from my  beginning which was terrible, I would like to know where else I went wrong.

Thanks];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq];B[jq]C[B should approach the corner at Q5 or R5, corner is theoretically  bigger than side.]
;W[pf]LB[qf:C][qk:D][qn:B][qo:A]C[This way of approaching the star-point is  usually disadvantageous.

Many possibilities for this move, you can consider -  point A or B (to  secure the corner), or approach at C if Black replies with O16/O17 then you  play D or just D alone to form a moyo.]
;B[qf]LB[nc:B][nd:A]C[Black should consider A or B instead.]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[rg]LB[pg:A]C[Personally, I think White A is better, S13 is like end-game  move to me.

Reason why S13 is no good: you have put a stone where you are not sure of  getting the points, lower right is sort of your influence but not territory  yet.]
;B[pe];W[of];B[nd]TR[pf]LB[rd:A]C[Although there is still some aji at A, Black's corner  is still bigger the side White is getting to get.

This is why I say Q14 (the marked stone) is usually disadvantageous.]
;W[qn]C[Maybe R9 or Q9 would be better?

R6 is good move to me.];B[qk]LB[om:E][pk:C][pm:A][pn:D][qm:B]
C[Black to reduce at A is better.

If White B then Black C or if White D then Black E.];W[pi]LB[ok:A]
C[White should have attacked at A.];B[ok];W[ni];B[ri]LB[mk:A]
C[Black A better (very urgent here).];W[fq]TR[jq]LB[mk:A]C[Would E3 be a better idea?

No, White A the most urgent.

You should be able to get sente after the attack, plenty of time to play E3  or F3...

You may even form territory at lower side and gobble up the marked Black  stone in the process of attacking.]
;B[mq];W[cf];B[be];W[ci]LB[dj:A]C[White A better, form a nice moyo on the left side.]
;B[bf];W[cg]TR[cf]C[Slow move, the marked White stone is "light" thus can be  sacrificed.

Imagine if Black were to play C13 to capture the marked stones, it is very  inefficient...]
;B[cm]LB[cl:C][cn:A][cq:B]C[If Black were to invade, A is a better point,  Black have B as the next move if White play somewhere around C.]
;W[dl]LB[ck:A]C[White to attack at A better, Black will have less  eye-shape.]
;B[dn];W[eo]LB[ep:A]C[White can consider A, more solid.];B[en]
;W[fn];B[el];W[dk];B[fm];W[gn];B[gm];W[jc]LB[hn:A]C[Again, White A is very urgent.

White K17 is off the main battlefield (lower left).];B[gc];W[je]
LB[mb:E][mc:A][nb:C][nc:B][ob:D][pb:F]C[Maybe M18 would be a better  move?

You can consider White A, Black B, White C, Black D... There is still aji at  F to survive at the corner...]
;B[lc];W[me];B[ne];W[nf];B[md]TR[md]LB[mf:A]C[Helping move (the marked move), Black should cut at A,  or just leave it, waiting for chance to cut.]
;W[le];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[kf];B[jf];W[if];B[lf];W[jg];B[mf]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[lh];B[ld];W[kh]C[Black gained only 4 points here, while making White very thick  outside.

A bad deal indeed for Black.];B[kg];W[jf]LB[hn:A][mk:D][pk:C]
[pl:B]C[White can ignore this move.

Attack at A, or play White B, Black C then White D.

In this position, Black has more points but 2 weak pieces, White have to  attack and profit to maintain the balance.]
;B[jh]C[Well, not wise to cut now, already 2 weak pieces, now 3...]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[mi];B[ii];W[hh];B[hi];W[gi];B[hk];W[gj];B[ik]
LB[ml:C][pk:B][pl:A]C[White should play A, Black B then White C.

A/B exchange making Black heavy and more vulnerable.];W[mm]
LB[qm:A]C[Black can play A and settle easily.];B[pn];W[po];B[qm]
;W[on];B[pm];W[lo]LB[qo:A]C[White A is huge.];B[qo];W[qp];B[ro]
;W[rp]LB[oo:A][pp:B]C[Black should make the exchange of A and B before  playing S6.]
;B[rn]LB[no:B][oo:A]C[Now, if Black play A, White may reply with B.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[jn]LB[iq:A][jp:B]C[White should continue with A... Black B then White cap  at K6...]
;B[iq]LB[or:A]C[Well, Black is alive because J3 and A are miai.]
;W[hr];B[or];W[pr];B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[no];B[lp]C[Good moves by Black.]
;W[mo];B[ko];W[mp];B[lq];W[nq];B[nr];W[kn];B[jo];W[io];B[ip]
;W[ho]LB[bl:G][bn:D][bo:C][cn:F][co:E][dm:A][em:B]C[Slow move again. White  do not have to connect here as both pieces are alive, cut at J6 is not  important at all.

White A, Black B, White C, Black D, White E, Black F and White G, remove eye  shape, take the points at the corner and side, force Black to make 2 eyes in  the center...]
;B[do];W[dp];B[bk]C[Black is very alert here...];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[cl]C[Bad exchange, just play C10, later you may have the chance to play  B8...]
;B[bl];W[cj];B[ek];W[dj];B[dm]LB[bn:A][em:B]C[Eye-shape is at A, B is false eye anyway.]
;W[gk];B[im];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[in];W[hp]LB[fo:A]C[White should protect cut at A.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[fo];W[gp];B[ep];W[eq];B[kk];W[mk];B[km];W[ln]
;B[ll];W[ml]LB[hn:A]C[Last chance for White, A is so urgent...]
;B[gl]LB[go:B][hn:A]C[Black should exchange A with B to make sure...]
;W[ej];B[hn]C[Black has won the game at this point.];W[ce];B[cd]
;W[fe]LB[fd:A]C[Black A will do.];B[ee]LB[fc:A]C[White can play A, however no impact on the result.]
;W[ef];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[gf];B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[de];B[bh]
LB[sf:A]C[Black A is the biggest point not B12 because of the bad aji  in the corner.]
;W[bg];B[ag];W[bd];B[bc];W[fk];B[ch]LB[go:A]C[This is gote 1 point, A is 4.5 points if I am not wrong.]
;W[dh];B[ah];W[sf]LB[rd:A]C[Why not try your luck at A... Maybe a ko at the corner.]
;B[re];W[fl];B[em];W[hj]C[Now comes the part where I try to kill the center stones if its  still possible]
;B[ij];W[kj];B[ki];W[lj];B[li];W[jj]LB[go:A]C[big mistake here

Black A can make 2 eyes, impossible to kill actually.];B[mh]

Let me know if you have any further questions.
