C[Hi,
I'm Jason. I would try to help you in this game. Let's go ! 



Hi, thank you for reviewing this game.

I play as Moltao here and i'm on white.
I've been playing Go for about 2 months now so needless to say i'm learning the basics. I think my rating is something of 29-30kyu, but i don't know for sure. Maybe you could give me an indication after having seen this game?
At the beginning of the game i felt like i wasn't doing too bad, but after that it went wrong somewhere (or maybe even before that).
I think i have some good moves every now and then but lack the strength to back them up.
So my main question would be, what are the biggest mistakes i made and what i have to think of in the future.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[jp];W[je]C[:should i have played on K16 there?

Yes. In the begining of the game, we usually play on 3 or 4 line. so k17 or k16 will be better.

By the way, q10 is good, too.];B[md];W[pj]C[:perhaps this move was too aggressive

This move is good! You stop black from make a big moyo.];B[pg]
;W[mg]TR[pm]C[Here, q7 to make your stone alive is more important.]
;B[lf];W[kg];B[mf];W[ld];B[le];W[kd];B[lg]C[i think i should have connected that spot sooner

There are some other bigger moves, like d10, r6 or q7.
If you lose some stone, try get them back at other place.];W[lh]

;B[ih];W[jh];B[ji];W[jg];B[ij];W[ei]C[:that one should've been more to the side i think

black can easily make alive at your side. so d10 or d9 will be better.]
;B[dk];W[ek]LB[ci:a][cm:b]C[:here is the attack that i dont quite know how to deal with

a and b are both good. Attack the black and make a moyo at the same time.]

So, do not care about them.];B[gi];W[gh];B[hh];W[dh]C[:was this right? or should i have played at G13?

G13 is better.];B[gg];W[hg];B[ig];W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[jf];W[he]
C[:i completely overlooked the four stones that are about to :be captured, i think i should have played on L15 here

In fact, h15 is better than l15.
If you played on l15 instead, black can invade your territory. You would lose more than 4 points.]

You can stop him before black played on p8 invade his corner at r3.]

It was too late to do this way. There was no space for you to make alive. Try earlier next time.]

Played on 3rd or 4th line in the bigining of the game.
Try to make every of your moves useful. Do not play useless one. This is good for you.

I might lose something important in your game. So, I'd be glad to discuss with you if you find any problem.




well that was a masacre, altho i think i have to mention that i normally play on 13x13.
I wanted to try 19x19 to see how it would go......not good apparently.
