;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[de];B[pj];W[nc]LB[nq:A]C[[wund\] I would prefer to play the  other kakari, at A, but this is also  possible.]
;B[jd]LB[ne:A][pc:B][qc:C][pb:D][qf:E][pf:F]C[How to handle this as white?

[wund\] Principally there are three  ways of answering such a  'pincer'-play, apart from ignoring it  (playing tenuki).
1) Playing towards the center (A,  typically).
2) Settle your group immediately in  or around the corner (B, C, D).
3) Playing another kakari (E or F)

please see the variations.]
(;W[pf]C[[wund\] I would have preferred to  enter the corner at the 3-3 point,  because that is very clear-cut (no  space for variation possible), and  white can't possibly get a bad result  that way.

This is not necessarily a bad move,  but it is a fighting move. Because  this is black's sphere of influence  (HIS sanren-sei) white is, in a sense,  looking for trouble :-)]
;B[of];W[og];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pg]C[[wund\] I think this is a good cut. I  really don't know all these joseki  (they do exist, though), but black  should play agressively in this kind  of position.]

(;W[qg]LB[qg:B][qf:A][ph:C]C[[wund\] This is the first really bad  mistake of this game. Look at it this  way; since you will have to connect  at A anyway, there is no need to  exchange B, which is nothing  special, for C, which is quite a large  move in the center.

[variation 4\]];B[ph];W[pb]
(;B[ob]C[[wund\] It feels quite natural to  block here, but I think it is a bit  slack.

[variation 5\]];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]C[Q: Any views on how things  unfolded in upper right?

[wund\] All things considered, I think  it is fairly equal. Black missed a  chance, though :-). If anything it  might be slighly better for black.]
;B[ep]LB[gd:A][dc:B]C[Is this the correct direction of play?  What about F4 instead?

[wund\] A moot point. Had black built  the solid thickness of variation 5,  this would have been spot on.  There is a lot of aji, potential  trouble, left on the upper right,  though. He might try to exchange A  for B, then play as he does now.]
;W[gq];B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[gp];B[hn];W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[co]
;W[bp]C[[wund\] This is one joseki.];B[ec]MA[ip]LB[gd:A][dc:B]
C[[wund\] This is a mistake in direction.   The marked point is THE way to  make all black stones work  together. As said, it would be nice  to exchange A for B, but the marked  point is so good that I would play  there with no hesitation  whatsoever. It does build a pretty  moyo :-)]
;W[cc];B[dj]C[D10 was considered slack in the  post game discussion. C11 seems  better.
Any views on this?

[wund\] I think D10 nor C11 are very  interesting for black. If u want to  play on the left side, extend all the  way up to C13. Black should not try  to make territory on the lower left  side, because he is both open at the  side and has a weakness in the  form of the cut at F6.

Anyway, locally black should react  to white 36 and play keima or such.  The play at J4 is also very very big]
;W[rj]C[[wund\] Now white has made a  mistake in direction. The big point is  still around J4.

Imagine black playing there; this  move on the second line isn't going  to be much help in reducing the  central moyo.]
;B[qh]C[[wund\] These 'kikashi' (forcing  moves) are unnecessary. Better to  play R9 immediately.]
;W[rh];B[qe];W[rf];B[pe];W[re]
(;B[qk]C[[wund\] J4 is still much more  important [variation 6\].]
;W[ch];B[gd]MA[ip]C[How to judge/evaluate the game as  it stands now?

White has more territory; black has  made a lot of central thickness.  Both have made some mistakes, so  I think the game is roughly even.  The vital point (marked) has been  ignored for some time by both; the  first to play there will be ahead, I  think.]
;W[cl]C[[wund\] Not such a good invasion,  because black is open at the side  anyway.   When you are ahead in territory, as  white is here, try to concentrate on  reducing the opponents' thickness  instead of grabbing more territory.]
;B[el];W[fh]C[[wund\] Not bad, but I think that  reducing the bigger moyo (eg, J16)  is bigger.]
;B[mq]MA[ip]C[Is N3 okay? Black said he did not  like white O3.  Corner can be taken,  right side still open and Black needs  another move
around K4 to seal off a moyo, no?

[wund\] Indeed, i agree, N3 is not ok.  Black should play the marked point,  forcing white to invade.]
;W[qq]C[[wund\] This is a bad mistake in  direction, though. Invading the  corner is 'gote', losing the initiative,  so after black can take the vital  point at J4 for an impressive moyo.

white should play around J4  himself; black cannot spare a move  to secure the corner at this point  anyway.]
;B[qp];W[pq]
(;B[oq]C[[wund\] Black could consider playing  at P4 (see the variation).]
;W[or]
(;B[nq]C[[wund\] I think this is slack; u want to  play the double 'hane' here, at O2.  Variation 8:]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]C[[wund\] Black has taken 'gote', lost  the initiative, so white has got away  with his mistake in direction  (invading the corner).]
;W[jp]C[[wund\] Excellent. I think white is  ahead now.];B[nr]
;W[pr];B[hg]C[
 jahy started observation.];W[hf]C[[wund\] Strange move]
(;B[he]C[[wund\] Black should cut (variation  9)];W[gf];B[if]
;W[hi]C[Aiming at reducing moyo and encircling black's left group.]
;B[ig]MA[ji]C[[wund\] Heavy. I'd consider playing  at the marked point.]
;W[jn]C[[wund\] OK move];B[ko]C[[wund\] Not a good kikashi. The  white 'ikken tobi'  (one point jump) is  just slighly loose, so later u might  want to peep on the other side.]
;W[jo];B[dh];W[cg];B[bo];W[dk]C[[wund\] Better to play at C10  immediately.]
;B[ek];W[cj];B[di]C[[wund\] Good. This fight is  dangerous for both.]
;W[ci]
(;B[eg]C[[wund\] This is difficult; I would make  a hanging connection at F10  (variation 10).]
;W[ji]C[[wund\] good];B[kh]C[[wund\] The problem for black is that  if he protects his moyo above, he  will hurt his territory below, and  vice versa.]

(;W[gl]C[[wund\] What happens if white  connects at J11?

I tried some variations; I think black  cannot live without losing  something.]
;B[fm]C[[wund\] Check again what happens  if white connects at J11.]

If that hadn't happened, it would have been a close  game. Black's chance to win was to play the kosumi  in the upper left corner (instead of black 175); White  could have secured the game through securing the  lower side with w126.
