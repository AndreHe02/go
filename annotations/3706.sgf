RE[B+Resign]

C[Henk: My first remark/question about the game is at move 10. But generally I would like to remark that this is the first time I submit a game for reviewing. I read about is in the latest number of the journal of the Dutch Go-society. I am very grateful for this opportunity. The game was played on Dragongoserver from 23 September 2005 till 24 October 2005. So it was not a 'hasty' game.

Hi Henk:

My name is Manuel, nick rosecroix, and I'll review your game. My comments will be preceded by "r:" 
I hope my comments are useful to you :-)];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp]

(;W[qk]C[Henk: Probably move 10 at F7 is better but I was afraid of facing a black wall after the fuseki. Is my fear justified?

r: It is justified in the case you are terrified by walls :-) In any case, sanrensei (Q16, Q10, Q4) isn't strictly a "wall", because there's still a lot of space between the stones. What are you going to do if black plays the so called "sanrensei" fuseki (See this fuseki in the first variation)? My advice here is that you finish the joseki :-) (see variation), and to don't be afraid of sanrensei, because there's a lot you can do between those stones.
Another possibility is to choose a joseki in which you finish sente and then play around r10]

(;W[cp];B[kp];W[cl]CR[ch][dk]C[Henk: After W 22 I won three stones but I felt already squeezed in between two black walls.

r: Although this point is big, because it's not just 3 stones, but almost half the lateral and it makes the black marked stones to start looking weak (so you can plan to attack them afterwards), you could have played otherwise after wC4 (which was a good play), bC12. But having in mind to play this stone later ;-)]

(;B[md]C[r: I don't like N16, because it tries to grasp too much, but doesn't succeed in protecting anything in a good way. There are lots of invasions in the upper side.]

(;W[qr]C[Henk: W P4 instead of R2 would have been better maybe?

r: maybe...because you can cut s4 stones from the rest of the group. See variation for a possibility.]
;B[op];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[nr];B[lq];W[os];B[rn]C[r: Careful with the R6 stones now!!!]

(;W[eg];B[eh];W[fh];B[fi]
(;W[nk]C[r: Ok, but you left the attack unfinished :-S];B[ok]

(;W[nj]C[r: You are leaving your q6 stones defenseless! Here black wins a LOT of points. It is very important that you protect groups like this.]
;B[ol];W[pf]C[Henk: In the end I lost all white stones on the right side (and gained some points in the middle) but I clearly should have made some plan at this point (or ealier). I thought I could maybe capture the four black stones at R12 and P9 but in retrospect that was much too ambitious.
This is my last remark about the game.

r: I agree with you];B[of];W[nl];B[om];W[gd]LB[hc:A][hd:B]C[r: A and B are also possible for invasion]
;B[gc];W[mn]C[r: I think it is better to continue with your idea in G16, try to get away in sente and then play N6]
