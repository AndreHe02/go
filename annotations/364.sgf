(;B[hq]LB[jd:A]C[Good. Also possible of course is A.];W[ql]
;B[qj]LB[ol:A][qi:B][pi:C]C[Good idea but the location of the stone is not optimal.
When you pincer white will jump out to A and then
the stone at r10 is too close to white's stones. So usually
this move is played at B or C.
The rule of tumb is: distance = hight of the wall.
In this situation white's wall has height three so
you play three points from the wall (B or C).];W[ol];B[nn]C[Good.]

(;W[mp]LB[oo:A]C[This move protects the bottom and aims at the
weakness at A. See diagram.]
(;B[ln]LB[oo:A][oq:B][oj:C]C[The normal move to defend against A is to play B.
But in this game black C is very interesting.
See the variations.];W[oo];B[on];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]
(;B[qp]C[Black is too focused on the corner here.
Basically, when having a choice between
the outside and the inside black should
in a handicap game always choose the
outside since the handicap stones will
work better in that case.];W[rn];B[pr];W[op];B[rr];W[qf]TR[qj]
MA[qo][qp][pp][pr][rr]C[sita: All in all I am not stisfied with this result. My corner group is shut in, four stones are floating in the center and I have gote! But I cannot find a mistake, so what went wrong?

jansteen: If you evaluate this position then two things are noteworthy:

1. The marked black stone on the right side is badly placed.
2. The black group in the lower-right is shut in.

So black didn't play consistently. The triangle stone aimed at
the outside, the square stones played from the inside.]

to avoid that white becomes stronger.];W[nk];B[ml];W[ok]

very complicated. Usually not wise in a handicap
game but of course by fighting you will gain
experience and become a stronger player.];W[of];B[nh];W[mk]

has become very complicated with four unsettled
groups fighting with each other.
Alternatively black could have settled for a compromise
as shown in the variation a few moves back.];W[mf];B[lh];W[kk]

(;B[gq];W[gp];B[fp];W[fo];B[eo]LB[iq:A][fq:B][ep:C]C[sita: Mistake? Better e4?

jansteen: yes, locally shape is e4 to prevent that
white A will become sente. Another reason is
that now white B, black C will give black very
bad shape.]
(;W[fn];B[iq];W[ip];B[jl]C[Good.];W[jk];B[il];W[jh]C[Painful for black. White is in the controling seat.]

(;B[lf]LB[kg:A][mg:B]C[Normal shape here is A since the move in the game
leaves a weakness at B for white to aim at.

in the variation.];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg];B[lj];W[lk];B[kh];W[kg]

;B[ko]C[sita: I feared for the life of my group, but in retrospect this move seems to be contra productive.

jansteen: black is happy to live here by any means.];W[jq];B[mo]
C[sita: This one should be sente, but even if I can capture the three cutting stones, now my group is alive and they seem to be quite worthless.]
;W[fq]C[Now we understand why white should have played
this move immediately before. Black can play as in the
variation.]

(;B[dr]LB[cq:A]C[Good style is to play this move at A.];W[gr]
;B[rd]LB[cf:A][cg:B][df:C][dg:D]C[sita: This should make a bit territory and furthermore help the lower group a bit (cut at q14). But was it to small anyway?

jansteen: It's very big but the left side is more urgent.
For example, black A, B, C or D to prevent a white move around there.]
;W[cf];B[fd]LB[fc:A]C[sita: Not good I think, but I didn't found a good pincer either.

jansteen: the direction is ok but better low at A since
the top is not very interesting to play more moves.
The focus in this position will be the left side.];W[hc]LB[kb:A]
C[A bad move since white is making territory
where he's open (black A). As said before
the focus is the left side.]
(;B[gc]LB[ec:A][hd:B]C[This is always a bad move since it strengthens white
and doesn't help the corner a lot (still a weakness at A left
after white answers with B).];W[hd];B[ce];W[df];B[bf];W[bg]
;B[be];W[cm]LB[cq:A][bp:B]C[Extremely large since this move has follow-up
moves with A or B as well.];B[dm]C[Good move to try to complicate things.]

sita: My last try...];W[dh];B[fg];W[di]C[Vulgair.];B[dj];W[ff]

with A here (black B is sente).]

;B[fe];W[gg];B[hf];W[eh];B[fh];W[fi];B[dg];W[gh]C[sita: Ok, that was the last mistake I allowed myself, so I resigned.

jansteen: Your game will improve when you concentrate on the
outside and less on the corners. If you see the final position then
black has four corners and seven groups while you started with
four handicap stones. So the task for you is to focus on connecting
your groups and concentrating on the center. You should overdo
this at first, give away all corners to the opponent and only play
ikken-tobi's to the center. When you experimented with this
style for a while try to find a balance between territory and a
center oriented game.])
