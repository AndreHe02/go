C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing!

I played black. I saw me in front after the middle game, but
an invasion in the upperside goes wrong. So, my main question
is: How to win such a won game, like this? Or: Was my estimation,
that i am in front wrong? There are some detailed questions in
the sgf, too.

REVIEWER COMMENTS BEGIN:

Greetings and thanks for the chance to review your game. Set
your SGF file viewer to show the upcoming move as the character
"a".  (i.e. toggle next move on). When I refer to "a", I mean
the upcoming move. If your viewer is set as I have asked, then
you should see the character "a" in the upper right corner at
Q16.

Please keep in mind that only higher ranking pros know the truth
about go. Amateurs like myself merely have occassionally interesting
random opinions. The value in any review is to stimulate your
own thinking about and enjoyment of your game.

John Stephenson 11/5/2001];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[Black plays the high Chinese fuseki pattern. The theme is to
build a moyo forcing White to invade, and gain benefit from attacking
the invader.];B[pk];W[nc];B[pf]C[Normally White continues at b to build a counter moyo and exercise
patience. White a seems too early, (since the middle game starts
before the opening is done.)]
(;W[qh]C[Black may play at b to make White heavy, then squeeze. See variation.
Still, a is not too bad.]
(;B[me];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[Pushing at a is not necessary. In general, don't push if you
cannot cut.];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc]C[Black may try to confine White to a small life on the right.
See variation.]
(;B[qj];W[oh]C[Next at b may be a better direction, because it forces White
into a narrow area, and Black shall naturally build territory
on the right.]
(;B[nj]C[White next plays an endgame move in the middle game. This cannot
be
right. The two White stones must run out.];W[qb]C[Black b is easier.]

(;B[ng]LB[mh:A][cj:C][jp:B]C[Better at A? Or is this play to small and i should play at B
or C?

ANS: Your Black 21 is better at A. I think White will die for
sure. Both B and C are big points, but, A is an urgent point.
The principle is   Urgent points before big points.];W[re];B[rf]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[rc]C[A is in the biggest general area. Good. But since Black got stronger,
playing at b is right.]
(;B[jp];W[po]TR[nj][pk][qj]C[An possible idea is Black at b (unusual move) to make White heavy,
thereby trying to use the marked stones, which are stronger than
the normal
Chinese pattern. See variation.]
(;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]C[Black a is a mistake; it looks like a tight defensive move useful
if this area were a White zone. But Black is stronger
in this zone. Black must play b to pressure the White's stones.]

(;B[or]C[White must try to make a base with b. In the enemy zone, living
right away is best if possible.]
(;W[no]C[Maybe Black at b gives White less forcing moves? On the other
hand, a is better if you do not have to go back and fix it later
with b.]
(;B[mo];W[nn]C[Black next at a is good! Now White is a floater.]
;B[qn]C[White a is not helpful or necessary.];W[op];B[nq];W[mn]
C[Play b is put more pressure on White?]
(;B[lo];W[ln];B[kn];W[ll];B[km];W[nl]C[Black next at b forces White into a narrow area. The flow will
cause Black
to naturally cover the two White stone on the right.]
(;B[lj];W[kl];B[jl];W[kj]C[Continue with b first to punish the White shape.]

(;B[fq]C[I was very happy with this white invasion.now i think i am in
front in both, territory and influence. is this true?

ANS:
Up to now Black is winning the game. But Black 51 (f3) is not
right. It is taking a big point before an urgent point again.
White a is too nice for White.];W[jk]C[Black a next is very fast. Interesting. But Black lost the pressure
on White's middle group. Black b seems necessary.]
(;B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo];W[ep];B[fr];W[dn];B[dm]C[i thougt about an play at c3 at some time in this sequence, but
i decidet not to do. was this wrong?

Take care of the outside first. If White survives in gote and
sealed in the corner, White is losing.

White could have cut at b instead of a.]
(;W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[ck];W[er];B[hq];W[bp]C[Black a is small. The black stones on the left are weakened after
White did B4 and need some help. Simply playing at b is patient.]

(;B[fn];W[em];B[dl];W[fm];B[gm];W[gl]C[Black's next play at a could be an overplay if White pincers.
If the Black stones on the lower left were stronger, than going
all the way to
a would be okay.];B[cf]C[White a may be passive; White could try something with b.]

(;W[fc];B[bd]C[The pincer with b is more interesting.]
(;W[cc]C[Now Black is settled nicely. Black's result on the left is good.]
;B[dh];W[mi]C[Black b seems like the proper tactical defense.]

(;B[nh];W[ni];B[oi];W[oj];B[pi];W[ok]C[A may not be necessary; how about b?]

(;B[ph];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[qk];W[li]C[here white gains some profit in gote. that was ok for me so far.
but now ...

White gained more than expected in the game sequence.];B[hc]
C[this is the invasion which leads to much trouble. maybe it was
to greedy? just play an reduction move at the fourth line? or
extend territory at the left?

Black can do this invasion. Because Black doesn't have any weak
group to worry about and Black has enough nearby friends to support
it. If you are not confident, then it is possible to play the
4th line.

White a is the honest answer to Black 93, since White cannot
easily see a way to take advantage of Black 93.];W[bc];B[he]
;W[le]C[Maybe b helps more, but it requires a deep reading.]

(;B[hh];W[di]C[Playing at b may be severe instead of at a. It helps Black on
the outside and could swallow White 98. But again, it requires
a deep reading.]
(;B[ci];W[ch]TR[dh][ci][di][ch]C[This is a cross cut. So, the first thing Black should ask himself
is, can he catch one of the cutting stones right away? If so,
probably do that. How about simply catching a stone by playing
at b? See variation.]
(;B[cj];W[dg]C[Now Black does have trouble. If Black gives White a ponnuki capture
by playing B12 to save his two stones on the upper left in gote,
his middle group becomes much weaker and dangerous.];B[eh]C[maybe i made some tactical errors in this sequence?

ANS: Yes, see previous comment and variation.];W[cg]C[White gained a lot. This is how Black lost. Black cannot really
rescue the left stones.];B[df];W[eg];B[ef];W[fh];B[ei];W[ff]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[gf];W[fg];B[fi];W[fd];B[ge];W[bf];B[be];W[ce]
;B[bg];W[de];B[gi];W[bh];B[gb];W[fb];B[jb]C[it looks like i played some ugly endgame-moves...]
;W[kb]C[A is small. B is huge (double sente).]
(;B[pc]C[this one for example];W[id];B[gc];W[ib]C[Black a does not work. You misread?]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[qd];W[pe];B[od];W[rb];B[oe];W[se];B[sf];W[sc]
C[B, c and d are all better than a.]
(;B[hj];W[ro];B[rn];W[rr];B[qo];W[pp];B[rp];W[rq];B[so];W[oq]
;B[pr];W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[nr];W[jm];B[il]C[here i saw me behind, so i want not to give up this stone.

It is too late.];W[gn];B[go];W[hm]C[B is better than a.]
(;B[hn];W[im]C[b is better than a.]
(;B[gm];W[ik]C[benni [8k\]: thx for the game
ytak [7k\]: thank you
benni [8k\]: i saw me in front, but you played a better endgame

*** LESSON FOR THIS GAME:

In general, to handle the cross cut, think like this:

 1. Can you catch one of the opponent's cutting stones? If yes
do it. Otherwise...
 2. Can you save both of your stones? If yes do it. Otherwise...
 3. Decide which of your stones is most important. Then, use
the
other stone as a sacrifice to get forcing moves that helps the
more important stone survive.])
