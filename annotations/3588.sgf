C[C: Hi, my name is Stefano and I wrote this review, which I hope will be useful for you. I marked my interventions to the following moves of this game with the string "C:". My go strength is about 5 kyu.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df]
(;W[gc]C[C: I have to start the comments with this move your opponent made. This move is weak. This kind of move kind of misses the point of the particular joseki, which is building a strong position in the corner. Now pretty much any move is sente against the corner, otherwise black gets a superior result (see var)]

(;B[dj]C[C: Good, but, after seeing all the trouble it got you in the game, since it's so high, this move was better played at C10.

I'm not saying that D10 is not a perfectly good move, just that the idea behind D10 is to complete the formation via a low (third line) approach on the lower left corner around C6 (if the opponent lets you, that is if he doesn't play C8 first)]
;W[po]
(;B[pl]C[C: Good idea to pincer, but maybe I would want to complete the left side formation with an approach move near C6 so as to stake out the left side as black area of influence. (see var.)]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[This isn't a joseki, should be favorable for me but doesn't seem so in my games.

C: In this game the problem was you didn't harass the underdeveloped white group. Once your opponent's group if in a goofy position, play moves that threaten to kill it! But be assured: your position is really favourable right now.]
;W[qm];B[ql]C[OK?

C: Yes! Also good strategy to deploy in handicap games: always block!]
;W[gq]C[C: This move doesn't make sense. The W group to the right is not strong enough and you should attack it now.]

(;B[cn]C[C: This was bad. You look like being afraid that the corner become W territory. But you forget you should attack the W group on the lower right side. See var.]
;W[dh]C[This is why I don't really understand D10 move. Did I do something wrong? The result was horrible.

C: *This W move* IS an horrible overplay. Playing in the middle of a proper extension (3 spaces from a 2 stone wall) fails. The fact that you regard the game's result as horrible indicates you attach too much importance to territory. True, it is startling to find that even with bad moves such as this one, the opponent can take away pretty much any territory he wants from our possession. But that must be weighted against the changed overall situation. In the game you got to make a 6 stone wall facing the center, while W made maybe 5 points of territory while destroying  maybe 10 pts of your t., so let's say gained 15 pts territorially, but a 6 stone wall is worth *at least* 30 points. If you didn't, you should read "Attack and defence", where this kind of balance (power vs. territory) is very well explained.]
;B[ch]C[C: A good move, keeping the connection of your groups is the best strategy.]
;W[ci]
(;B[di]C[C: Yes.];W[cg];B[eh];W[bh];B[eg]C[C: Very good! Now I would be very happy to have such a wall in sente! (W must connect!)

Anyway, also atari at D13 is possible (harass W more, but leave some bad aji for a possible cut in the wall... )]
;W[cj]C[C: White wants to crawl, and you must second him];B[dk]
C[C: Excellent. Let White push you all he wants (as long as he isn't pushing on the fourth line).]
;W[bf];B[mp]C[Too small?

C: No, the idea (to attack the W group) is still good

But... (Forgive me if I sound obvious: just to be absolutely clear) Remember not to play this move if you intend to make some territory on the south side. That doesn't make sense: not with the G3 third-line stone in place.]
;W[jq]C[C: I don't like this one, just thinks about territory. Fuseki and middle game is mostly about safety of groups. If you want to believe it, play against a stronger player a high handicap game.]
;B[jd]C[What about this one?

C: The idea is pretty good. In this case, it makes good balance with your wall on the left, your komoku and the Q8 wall. 

More generally, I like this kind of high, "i don't care about side territory" extension -- and there's a bonus: usually they turn out to get a lot of side territory, since it's painful anyway for your opponent to slide under such a stone on the second line! (usually if your opponent wants to steal the territory he will slide to K18 for example, but that's so low! On the second line!)]
;W[qh]C[C: Pretty place to invade, but I personally would have played one line higher (Q12) since with the R16 and R8 stones in place it will be hard to make a base anyway. Now a capping play (P12) seems possible.]
;B[pi]C[Right side?

C: Yes, a move like P10 or Q10 by White would be painful, if you had pushed from the north side.]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[pe];B[oe];W[md]C[I have no idea how to handle such situations, I'm really bad at killing as well as giving my weak stones life.

C: To improve that, play many high-handicap games against weaker players.
 It's always a good idea playing teaching games: you learn *at least* as much as you teach, if not more!

But returning to the white move. This is a bad W overplay. Of course he's trying to confuse you, but the best course of play in such cases is just to close your eyes and finish off the abandoned W group -- P14 would be normal, now you can play there.]
;B[of]C[C: Very good];W[ph];B[oh];W[qi];B[pj]C[C: Very good sequence for B]
;W[re]
(;B[kf]C[C: Maybe this move is a bit vague, and besides it leaves unfinished business on the right side - S16 is still sente (W cannot play elsewhere or his group dies, see var), and would give black better aji in the corner. Otherwise, the cut at P16 is still an issue: I would have protected it (with something like O16)]
;W[oc]C[C: This is the classic bad move (it peeps where he could cut)]
;B[pc]C[C: Ouch, this way W will split your group and force you to live in the corner. Better connect.]
;W[od];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[rd];B[rc];W[oa];B[pb];W[kc];B[jc]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[mb]C[C: Yes but you left a cut behind (at J17) so if W is shrewd he will give up 4 stones and link to his main force to the left (via H18 for example)]

(;W[mc];B[hc]C[C: You were lucky here.];W[gd];B[hf];W[he];B[if]
C[I think I have no chance but try to make central territory.

C: Yes. Or kill the weak lower right W group. If you're afraid you can't, then just deny access to the center to that group, and he will have to spend a move or two living, while you complete your center moyo. (Move like O6 or P7 I'm thinking of)]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[ng];B[nh]C[C: Sacrifice feels good.];W[og];B[hm]
;W[nn]C[C: This is the price for not having sealed W in, which you could have done in sente!]
;B[lm];W[jm]C[C: What a horrible overplay! I really dislike this way of playing, so jealous and inconsequential!]

(;B[jl]C[C: This is too passive - you shouldn't think only about defending, even if it's natural protecting your only big territory. Be creative! W has weaknesses, too, and you must exploit them. What about cutting off a big chunk of W's group with J4 instead? (See var.)

This is not the last comment -- see the last move of the game for my last comment and some highlights.]

;W[gm];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[fj]C[It seems hopeless for black to make enough at this point.
The game went on for some moves until I resigned.

C: Too bad, because your style is far superior than your opponent's. Unfortunately you played too passively in this game, and made some big mistakes too, but you have a big potential for improving if you correct a few small but important details. Practice tesuji to improve in killing and attacking groups, and improve your feel for attacking playing high handicap games against weaker players.

My general opinion and final piece of advice:

You are a more of a territory-oriented player, so when your opponent steals territory from you, even in unfavorable-for-him exchanges, giving you superior thickness, that makes you unhappy and you lose control of the game. In this game a way to avoid that could be to play a lower extension from the left-side joseki wall (C10 instead of D10 at move 11 would make things a lot easier). Since you played D10, you came off with a magnificent wall. You showed good judgement in choosing the consequent, moyo oriented line of play (I'm thinking of moves like Q8 and K16), but you got tricked into losing much territory by playing passively where you could, and should have, counterattacked. 

So if you want to try, I suggest you to play a few influence-oriented games, starting with high stones in the corner (4-5 or even 5-5) to have a better feel for attacking. If you don't think about territory (which you will get anyway in the end if you play correctly, using thickness to "stare down" at your opponent and attack him, not to surround territory in front of it) it's a fun way to play! 

If you want to avoid the fighting, nothing wrong, but then choose low approach moves to the corners, and also try to play low extensions (where possible), that is choose josekis that have you extend on the third rather than on the fourth line. If you stay tight, it will be impossible for your opponent to come in. But then you must be prepared to face large moyos, and then to invade them if you want to win -- either way, if you build or try to destroy them, you need to learn how to deal with them.

All said, keep up the good go and good luck!])

(;W[iq];B[jp]C[C: K7 dies naturally])
(;W[jp];B[iq]C[C: Now B tries to capture the three W stones to the right, and if he fails, he uses J3 and J4 to threaten the corner. In either case, you win!]

(;W[fq];B[pl])
(;W[qq];B[fp])))
(;B[ic]C[C: This kind of move need not be played necessarily now (of course B must extend from his three stones on the left). Once a weakness is in a formation, it doesn't just go away. So that gives you time to wait for the best opportunity to attack. Once a weakness like this is in a position, sooner or later it will start to ache.]
