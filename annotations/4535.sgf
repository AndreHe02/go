Everything is quite standard up to this move. This is not good.

One problem with this move is that it is too early.  An extension along the bottom would be bigger, or an approach on the top right.

The other problem with it is that it is too close. This strengthens what is being attacked. It should be at E10 or E13.]
;B[eg];W[qo]C[Is it possible for black to play P5, or should play black at Q5?

*********************
White's move here is unusual. Typically its one line higher at Q5. White will be at a disadvantage in the coming fight.

I think Q5 is OK. P5 is too loose. See variations.]

Make some terretory at A
or Invade with B

******************

A is too close to thickness - Black would be forced.

I am not sure that B is necessary yet. White cannot close off this area with one move. There is always the 3-3 point. If White D3, then H4 might be good.

Up top looks bigger, to prevent Black's corner from being sealed in. O17?]

3-3 is probably safest and best. D3 is another option, more tricky.

b+R (black wins by resign)

Do you have a last tip for both players to improve their gameplay?

Thanks for commenting this game.

*************************
The game is over.

White generally suffers from over aggressive play. White needs to invade less and expand/strengthen his own positions more.

Black was too tentative on the bottom, and then the invasion was not successful. Black needs to use other stones to help him when he invades, and not just run out.

Both players would benefit from working through life-and-death problems, which were mistakes made by both sides.

Both players showed good ability when on the attack. These moves were generally well placed and resulted in a lot of dead stones. Black was especially good with right hand group.

Good luck with your future play
