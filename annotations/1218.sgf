C[[icepick\] My second submission to GTL.

Both
my opponent and I agreed that this was one of the best games we've played
in a while. We'd both appreciate any comments, tips, or suggestions you
can provide.

I played black, but feedback for both sides would be great. I've lightly anotated from my point of view.

z:
Hello.  I play on IGS as "zenjutsu" (10k*).  I will preface my comments with "z:".

I'll try to give lots of commentary for both sides.  However, remember that I'm a low-rank too, so take all my comments with a healthy dose of skepticism.

I found that this game was generally well played on both sides, considering rank.  My one general comment is that both players may want to focus on "what is urgent" vs "what is big".  There were many plays made that appear neither urgent, nor big.  ...and a few big plays made when an urgent one remained.  Overall, an excellent game.  Thank you for letting me review it.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[nq]TR[ic][qn][pn][pm][qm][id][jd]
[jc]SQ[ep][eq][fq][fp]C[z:  Not certain I like this play.  I think the best way to attack this corner is more in the R6 area.  Or, if you feel you must play in the bottom, then play in the E3 area.  Personally, I prefer the Chinese opening (J17 area).]
;W[pn];B[pr];W[qf]SQ[qj][pj][qk][qi][qh][pi][ph]C[z:  Not certain I like this white play either.  What if black pincers around one of the square-marked spots?  That would put great pressure on both of white's right-side groups.]
;B[nc]C[z:  I still like the pincer better.];W[pj]C[z:  Right side looks big, but it will be easy for black to invade it.  Very loose framework.]
;B[jp]C[z:  Good.];W[ec];B[ed];W[hc];B[dc];W[eb];B[db];W[fd]
;B[ee]TR[fe][ep][eq][fq][fp][jc][qd][qh][ql][pl][ph][cm][dm]
[cn][cl][dl]C[z:  Not urgent (group would live without this stone, and it does not threaten the death of white.  Perhaps playing any of the marked points would be bigger?]
;W[fe]TR[gq][fq][lq][lp][qq][rd][ph][qh][ql][lc][cj][dj][dk]
[ck][ci][di]C[z:  Also neither urgent nor big.];B[ef]C[z:  Neither urgent nor big.]

(;W[ch]C[z:  Good idea.  Big reduction, and threatens to make large territory also.  However, I wonder if there are some sente moves out there to be played first.  See alternative move tree for possibility.]

(;B[dj]TR[di][ei][eh]SQ[cn][cm][cl][dl][dm][ck]C[z:  What is goal of this play?  Capture, or force to live small? I don't think you'll be able to capture.  To force it to live small while you make a wall, perhaps triangle-points better? Personally, I prefer attacking both this stone and bottom corner at same time with a square-point, or conceding side while acquiring bottom, such as in alternative move tree.]
;W[eh]C[z:  Good.  Escape, and seperate out weak black stone.]
;B[dn];W[eq];B[cg]C[z:  I think this stone is wrong.  Attaching will make him stronger. Right now, your corner is quite secure.  However, your two stones on the left are weak.  I prefer strengthening those two stones, not strengthening white's two and making them into a wall.]
;W[rd]C[z:  Good.  This play is big, and sente.  If black d/n respond, he risks a HUGE fight to survive with his two top stones.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[jd]C[z:  No.  Too high.  White can sneak under this stone.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[lb]TR[jb]C[z:  What would have happened if black had atari'ed instead?]
;W[jb];B[ld];W[he];B[gg]C[[icepick\]
I was trying to keep his groups seperated, as well as jump out in the middle.

z:  Keeping his two stones seperated is a good idea.  However, you need to ask "how will the ensuing battle impact my two stones on the left?"  Also, jumping into the middle does not seem either urgent or big.  White would be hard pressed to make territory in the middle.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[qa]TR[hq][qq][ql][qh][lq][lp][fi]
[ci][dl][cl][iq]C[These plays in the corner were significant, however I think other plays may have been larger for white.]
;B[pf];W[ej];B[ek];W[cj]TR[di]C[z:  I'm not certian I'm playing out the possibilities correctly, but this white play appears to leave black a natural play at D11.]

(;B[fj]TR[di];W[ei];B[dk];W[dg];B[cf];W[fg];B[ff];W[gh]TR[ci]
SQ[hh][gi][hi][hg][gj]C[z:  Now white looks quite strong.  Also, white can either continute running to center (squares) or build a base (triangle).]
;B[eg]C[z:  Bad move.  This only forces white to become stronger.  Furthermore, white can afford to ignore it.]

(;W[fh];B[gf];W[hh]TR[ci][gj][ih][hi]C[z:  No.  If you wish to strengthen this group, there are better plays.  This play just feels too slow]
;B[gq]C[z:  Good.  This seems a reasonable time to move away from the left.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[hp];W[cn];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm];W[fo]C[z:  This feels like an overplay to me.]

(;B[fn]C[z:  Try F4 to punish the overplay.  I'm not confident of my readings in the alternative move tree, but give it a whirl.]
;W[en]C[z:  I believe this is also an overplay.  Again, I'm not certain my suggested move trees are at all accurate.]

(;B[em];W[eo];B[gn];W[ij]C[z:  Good.  This eliminates the risk of black making significant territory in the center, while also strengthening your left group's escape route.]
;B[hk]TR[qq][qg][no][qh][ph][ql][pl]SQ[fm][fl][gl][fk][gm][hm]
[hn][in][hl][im]C[z:  This protects very few points.  10 at most (square).  Perhaps a triangle point is bigger, and maintains sente?]
;W[gj]TR[ql][qq][no][pg][qh][qg]C[z:  Very small.  This almost (in terms of territory) feels like an endgame play.  Perhaps a triangle point instead?]
;B[gk]C[z:  Again, very small.];W[hj]C[z:  Again, small.];B[if]
TR[pg][og][lf][mg]C[z:  ?  What does this do?    If you want to threaten white's top group, try F18 first.  It's guaranteed to be worth points, whereas this only provides a minute threat of being surrounded.

If you are trying to capture the left group, give up.  It is alive.

If you are trying to build territory on your top group, try a triangle instead.

If you are seeking to connect your top and upper corner groups, don't bother.  Both are alive.

If you are trying to prevent white from making center territory, don't worry about it.  There are larger plays.]
;W[do];B[dm];W[ci];B[ig]C[z:  Again, what does this do?];W[ik]
;B[nn]C[z:  Good!  This is an excellent play!  It does many things at once.  It threatens to attack white's right side. It builds your bottom territory.  It prevents an invasion at M3/M4.  It reduces risk of white making center territory.  It is an excellent move!]
;W[hl]C[z:  Black can ignore this.]
(;B[gl];W[pl]TR[ql]C[z:  Good, but I'd go third line.  All 4th line still risks a black invasion.]
;B[nl];W[mi];B[oh];W[ph];B[mh];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[il]TR[qq]
[pg]C[z:  Good, but I think I prefer marked spots first.  They appear to be sente.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[lh];W[lf]
(;B[jg];W[ki];B[li]C[z:  Risky.];W[lj];B[jl]C[[icepick\] Mistake, P13 kills my stones now. P13 would have been much better.

z:  Yep.  You see it.  This was a very painful mistake.];W[og]
C[icepick [24k\]: Darn it.

z:  Yep.];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf]C[z:  Good use of your stone's aji to build up what wall you can. However, these last two plays are neither urgent, nor as large as other sente plays on the board.  Also, they could be saved for ko threats.]

[ks][js]C[[icepick\]
This starts up a big fight, up until this point, I think that it's very
close, maybe a slight edge to white due to the loss of those 5 stones.

z:  Well, let's count.  I'm not the best at counting, but it looks like white has about 19 in the lower left, 7 in the top, 41 on the right, 5 prisoners, and 0.5 komi (total of @ 72.5). Black has 15 in upper left, 13 in upper-right, and 38 in bottom (total of @ 66).  Game is quite close.  If black takes bottom right corner, he's probably in the lead _even_if_ white stays alive with his L8 reduction.]
;B[km];W[lm];B[ll]C[z:  Good.];W[kk]
(;B[ml]C[[icepick\] Trying again to keep him seperated.

(;B[jr]C[[icepick\] He connected, so I elected to take what I could. Would have attempting to cut at P4 been better?

z:  Well, firstoff, N3 is better for a "safe" method of "take what I could".  However, I think P4 would be too aggressive.]

(;W[op]TR[lr]C[z:  Safe.  I sometimes play a little risky, so I might give M2 a shot.  It looks like it could be good.  But then it might not be.  I'm not entirely certain.]
;B[mq];W[oq];B[or]C[[icepick\]
Greedy in retrospect, I should have played M2, though I think I would have
lost because of the huge territory on the right.

z:  No.  This play is okay.];W[lr]
(;B[qq]TR[nr]C[[icepick\] Decided to abandon the two stones, and attempt to live in the corner.

z:  NO!  No no no no no!  Did I mention "no"?  Just connect at O2.  : >]
;W[nr]C[z:  Good.  Take advantage of black's generosity.];B[qp]
;W[ro]C[z:  Oops.  This is a bad play.  Black could damage you.]

(;B[rp]C[z:  Empty triangle.  Continue to extend first.];W[js]
;B[ir];W[os];B[ps];W[ns]
(;B[so]C[[icepick\] Fatal mistake. S2 lives. (see variation)

z:  True, S2 would live.  Sorry  :(]
(;W[sn]TR[rn]C[z:  Too aggressive.  What if black S6?]
(;B[sp]TR[rn];W[rr]TR[rn]C[z: Good.  ...however, black can still live.]

(;B[qo]TR[rn]C[[icepick\] S2 kills the group. I was attempting to live by killing the white stones to the left.

z:  Good play.  This gives your corner another liberty to use to make life in corner.]
;W[rn]
(;B[po]C[z:  Ack!  No.  Make life in corner.  I think my alternative move tree works.]
;W[oo];B[on];W[pm];B[qn];W[rm];B[qm];W[rl];B[ql];W[qk];B[pq]
;W[mr]C[z:  It is now quite clear that both white groups in the lower right will live, and the black corner will die.  ...unless black makes a ko or a seki.]

(;B[df]TR[fb][pa][pg][an]SQ[id][bh][la]C[[icepick\]
I tried to see a throw in or something to kill white's lower group, but
I don't think it's there. I loose the corner, and the game as a result.
I kept playing to work on my yose skills.

z:  You are right, there is nothing there to kill white's lower group.  It is very alive.  Regarding the corner, it is not dead yet.  You can still make a ko or seki, I think.  Last, for yose, remember the value of sente.  This play is worth one point in gote.  Instead, play a sente play such as one of the triangles. ...or even a gote play worth more points, such as one of the squares.]
;W[bl];B[am];W[al]C[z:  Overplay.  Black should punish this.]
;B[bk]C[z:  Good job.];W[bj];B[ak];W[aj];B[ck];W[bg];B[bf];W[ag]
;B[dh];W[di];B[af];W[bh];B[ok];W[pk];B[jk]C[z:  White doesn't _have_ to respond to this.  There are still sente moves available for more points.]

(;W[jj];B[lk]
(;W[kj]C[z:  No!  White should not play here.  This is a one point play. Play elsewhere.]
;B[mj]C[z:  This play does nothing.  You won't gain a point... white can easily put you in atari.  Plus, it reduces liberties in this area, thus risking the possibility of a "slip up" that enables white to capture a group.  Stick with sente moves that do not risk you own security.]
;W[nj];B[mk];W[nk];B[jh]TR[sr][fb][ol][qe][ea][an][la]C[z:  Again, a one point play, in gote.]
;W[ol]C[This play is worth three to white (1 prisoner, 2 territory). If you had P8 on last play (as an example of options) it would not happen.  K12 gained 1, but P8 gained 3 for white.]
;B[om]C[z:  Ouch!  If white plays right (N6) you'll lose these 4 stones.

Also, even if white does not play right, this is only worth 1 point (the O7 liberty) while there are more valuable plays yet to be made.]
;W[mn]C[[icepick\] Ouch. Missed this.

z:  Yep.  :(];B[lm];W[nm];B[id]C[z:  Good.  I prefer other sente moves first (F18, A6, Q19), but this is much better direction for your yose.  Stick with sente moves in yose, and you will improve a few stones!]
;W[hd];B[ie]C[z:  Hrm.  Don't like this one.  The previous move (J16) was to destroy white's two points at J17 and H16.  This play doesn't do anything... white can L14 to invade this minor "territory".]

(;W[hf]C[z:  No.  Black does not need to connect to live.  These are dame (neutral, meaningless points).  This play is worth 0 points in gote.  Furthermore, if you are trying to connect your group to ensure life, you are better off ensuring life in a manner that increases your territory.  See alternative move tree.]

(;B[hg]C[z:  I'd rather let white connect.  He _should_ be able to make life on the top without any problem.  Instead, take F18.  He connects to live, but you damage his territory.]
;W[ge];B[ic]C[z:  Good.  This is a sente attack.  White must respond.  It does not reduce white by much, but he _must_ respond.  Basically, this is a free 1 point reduction in white's territory.]
;W[ib]
(;B[ea]C[z:  Good.  F18 also an option.];W[fb];B[fa];W[ga];B[da]
;W[hb]TR[gb]C[z:  I prefer G18.  H18 leaves black G18 as a ko threat.]
;B[ka];W[ja];B[la];W[of];B[oe];W[qe];B[pe];W[pg];B[pa]C[z:  Good.  Sente play.]
;W[rb];B[an]C[z:  Yes!  I've been waiting for this one for a long time.]
;W[bo];B[ao];W[ap];B[is];W[ks];B[fp];W[ep];B[gs];W[fs];B[hs]
TR[fi][kf][ih][ii][fq]C[z: No.  This stone is worth 1/2 point in gote.  Treat ko-points like this as 1/2 point, because it could get captured back and forth all game long.  There are other plays worth more than 1/2 point.  I think L14 is 3 points, F3 is 2 in sente (therefore should be your first play), the other triangle points are each 1.]
;W[ss]C[z:  Yes!  The corner is now officially dead.  Excellent play!]
;B[fq]C[z:  Good!  You saw that this was a sente play!  It gains you one point, and costs him 1.  A good play!]
;W[er];B[ii];W[hi];B[fi];W[ih];B[ji];W[gi];B[fk];W[kf]C[z:  Yes!  Excellent play white.  Black may have wanted to play here before the gote 1-pointers in middle.]
;B[ke];W[jf];B[je];W[tt]C[z:  White could have D13 instead of passing.]

[or][pr][qr][sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ls][ms][ps][qs][rs]C[z:  White won by a wide margin primarily because black erred in the lower right.

For future improvement, I recommend:

(1)  life-and-death problems.  This will help you see when you are alive/dead, and when your opponent's stones are firmly alive (therefore your attacks being gote, not sente).

(2)  focusing on playing urgent plays first, and then big plays. Often in the early game, both players play non-urgent, small plays.  There were bigger plays to be made.

(3)  focusing on sente plays in the end game.

Again, thank you for letting me review your game.  It was a fantastic game, and I am certain both players have risen in rank since submitting this game, as the quality of play felt much higher than 23 and 24k.
