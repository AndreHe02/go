C[Dear reviewer, I was really astonished when I saw the result of this game, because I thought I was in the lead.
My weakness is Fuseki I think so it would be great if you could have a closer look at it.
Thanks.

Review by J Lindblad (JL),  Finnish 1 kyu.

JL: there is no one best move here. Many possibilities, but a move on the upper side is preferred. I'd probably make a shimari most of the time or might even extend to 'A'.]
;B[ep]MA[ic]C[JL: I would prefer putting some pressure on the marked stone first. After all, if white makes this shimari, black can extend on the side down from his own shimari.]
;W[dn];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[hq];W[nc]C[JL: feels like a good light move.]
;B[pc]LB[pf:A]C[JL: this is territorially big, but  also you basicly force white to strenghten his position. Also there isn't really any really good continuation for black here. Maybe better to play faster down the side, 'A' or so. This way you may still retain the option of invading white position if he does not protect it, while if he does, you are developing faster than in the variation you played. Still, I can not critisize this move much.]
;W[ld]C[JL: white's got a solid shape there now, which is a pity since it used to be black's sphere of influence.]
;B[pf]LB[gc:A]C[JL: The reason why I think this is an ok move, is that otherwise white might play surprisingly close to this corner from this side. Another option would have been 'A' to develope the corner and harass the three white stones a little. I think 'A' would have been better as it would indirectly made it harder for white to play an agressive approach on the right hand side by weakening the top white group.]
;W[fc]C[JL: as black extersion instead would have been at least almost sente, this is quite big. Black almost has to answer as his corner is not at all solid.]
;B[nq]LB[fd:B][ec:A]C[JL: instead 'A' or maybe 'B' to protect the corner. Black should not mind strenghtening white here as he is strong already. Simple 'A' would make black corner a bit stronger while white would become a bit over concentrated.]
;W[pn]LB[ql:A]C[JL: probably better to play one line lower (keima). Hard to use the extra influence as black is solid everywhere and also can (and should) now play 'A'.]
;B[pr]LB[ql:A]C[JL: wrong direction and aji-kesh - white is happy to answer at 3-3. The lone black stone is ok, no need to strenghten it - if white plays a hasami (pincer), black can escape to the corner, while if white plays a kosumi-tsuke, black's lower left group will be of help (and the corner will remain open). Proper move instead was 'A' - extension from one's own position that also attack's the weakness of the two white stones.]
;W[qj]C[JL: white should have just played at 3-3 and then extend as black would play M4.]
;B[qh]C[JL: very bad move. This is slow, and black group is now over concentrated. There was no need to protect this group. Also territorially this is not too big. Instead 3-3 in the white corner is much much much bigger and would secure the black group there while gouging the base of the white group.]
;W[qq]C[JL: white is now happy.];B[kp]C[JL: a greedy move leaving weaknessess. The standard move one line to the right is just about always better and much more solid. Black tries to do too much with one move leaving himself thin.]
;W[ch]C[JL: a big move and just about absolute sente.]
(;B[df]LB[fd:A]C[d14 looks kinda slow, is there a better way to andwer c12?

JL: it's a passive move aimed at defending? I probably would have played 'A' or so. Though, This move you played makes it impossible for white to secure the side with one move, so can't critizise it much. It is passive, that is it's only problem, solid, but passive.]
;W[dk]C[JL: white is now thin and black should be able to reduce this side quite abit.]
;B[ql]MA[kp]C[this was too early, wasn't it?

JL: no, it's a good move. What else was there to do now? You are solid above, though you now wish you'd played the marked stone one line to the right, right?]
;W[pk]C[JL: agressive attack.]

JL: One line above the point you played would be better. You need to break into the center somehow, but I don't value 'A' too much either. Probably better to play from the other side of the board, 'B' or so. The kosumis on the sides are also getting big now (moves like 'C'.]

;W[fh]C[JL: not sure what white tries to accomplish with this move. Doesn not make terrirory at all and it's been endgame for a while.]
;B[fl]LB[ko:A]C[JL: 'A' better.];W[jn];B[im]C[JL: maybe no good, hard to say. I'd never find this kind of move i am sure.  if you'e worried about white getting center territory, maybe a move that would have a miai-connectio to either the group down or to the group on the right might be good. However, what is the best move in the center is impossible for me to say.]
;W[kf];B[jm];W[km]C[JL. no real reason to play this stone.]

;B[ob]C[JL: finally a big move.];W[nb]LB[fb:B][cr:A]C[JL: answering to opponent's moves won't win games. Better to fight fire with fire and play a similar endgame move elsewhere. After all black can still make a sente-hane making this defencive move small. Maybe 'A' or 'B' instead.]

Thanks for reviewing.
Is my opinion that my weak point is the fuseki right? When I went over this game again, I didn't find any moves of mine, which i would call mistakes in middlegame or yose. If you do (you sure will ^^) please mention them.

Thanks again.


JL: oh, I did find some bad moves in middlegame/yose too :-) don't worry though, I make at least as many in my games too ;) I would say, that in fuseki, you play too passively - you don't put pressure on the opponent stones. Also you are too preoccupied by the security of your lone stones - playing lighter will help.]
