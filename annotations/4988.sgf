You played a nice game.
You like to fight (more than me ;) ), and that is good.
You really have good ideas and you are not afraid to swap some 30 points.

problem:

If you want to invade, do not damage your own groups
(better not invade C17, H12)

Try to forget your stones, when they are useless
You tried to use H9, that didnt work

In the early endgame, you did not see the sente-moves
You missed S2 and A6, really big ones!

I hope I could help
