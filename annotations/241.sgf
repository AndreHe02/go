C[Hi Goran

I am only 4dan, so I am not much  stronger than you, but I will do my best to  give you some tips and new ideas.

francy


PS: i had some problems with hibiscus  because sometimes my comments are  erasured (maybe the was wrong :-))]
;B[pd]C[Hi!

Although I lost this game by resignation I
wondered a lot why it happened so I
decided to sent it to GTL. I was faced with a
5d (And I've been promoted to 2d for this
tournament) so I decided to put up a fight.
I highlighted my main points of interest but
please feel free to add comments wherever
you feel they are needed.

I use Hibiscus go for reviews.

Thank you.

;B[cf];W[cd];B[dn]LB[dn:13][pj:A]C[At this point I wondered a lot about A.  White
answered my kikashi's but still I couldn't
let them go.

Q: Any thoughts?

I would prefer your move too];W[fq];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[white makes it easy for black; black got a  good formation.
I think white is very certain to win and  plays secure];W[qj]

(;B[qm]C[Q: Should this have been one space
higher?

no];W[qg];B[mc]LB[mc:21][qe:B]C[I thought about B but it seemed my  marked
stone was to far from white group to make
an attack successful. Anyway I thought  this
was o.k.

Q: Is this correct?

Yes; I think this too
B is a very big point later, but it is not  urgent now];W[rd]
LB[qc:A]C[white loses his chance to play A; so I  would not play this way now]
;B[qc]LB[qc:23][rf:A][kq:B]C[black can play at A later so this variation  is ok for black
black can also play a big move at B now];W[nq]
(;B[pq]LB[pq:25][kp:C][ql:D]C[A pincer around C didn't appeal to me so I
began to wonder about my marked stone.

Q: Should I have played it at D? Is B25
correct?

If you played D; maybe white would not  play this way, so there is not need to  think about it now; if you played a bad or  doubtful move, forget it during the game it  only makes you nervous


C is not so dubious; a good thickness  works well with blacks position on the left.

but I would prefer an other variation];W[no]LB[no:26][kp:E]
[go:F][mp:A]C[My opponent didn't like E as I could have
erased with F and start to build my mojo  on
the left, but this seemed like an invitation
for me to invade.



I think black must attack the two white  stones. E is ok but I would play kikashi at  A first.]

(;B[lq]LB[or:A]C[Q: Was this correct?

for my feeling this is to low; black can  come under attack.

black has the possibility to connect  underneath, but this should not be  necessary. White A can then become  painful.]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[jp];B[jo];W[hp]
(;B[nm]C[I didn't want to connect the cut so I
decided to make an inducing move here.

The game is close; I think black is slightly  ahead. So it is very important what will  happen with this two weak groups.

Blacks plan must be to build a moyo on  the left side. Black should drive the white  stones on the right side and make a  splitting- or leaning - attack

B33 seams to become a neutral point.];W[mn];B[kn]C[Tough choice. I thought the hanging
connection will help more with the fight in
the center but my shape seems thin now.

Q: Was B35 correct?

yes];W[mm];B[nk]C[Things look o.k. to me this far. I do  wonder
about B37 though.

Q: Should it be a normal extension (1
space below 37 at w 38)?

yes; I think this look better
but your stones to fare away to have a  effect of the white group on the right]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[ml];B[ok]LB[ok:41][om:G]C[Now white is left with aji at G.

not so terrible];W[nr]LB[nr:42]
(;B[kr]LB[kr:43][mq:H][ho:I][lr:A]C[Now I couldn't find a good move. I would
have liked to answer this at H but couldn't
because of the hanging connection  (marked
stone) So I began to doubt that choice too.

Q: What do you thing about B43 at I?

A is correct shape

If you like to play I see the variation from  move 33

I think you should play a move in the  centre first.];W[qo]
C[This seems premature but it did a lot for
white's security on the right and it
weakened my group here a lot.];B[po];W[qn]
(;B[pn]LB[pm:A]C[is A not possible?];W[rm];B[rl];W[ql];B[pm]
;W[rk];B[rn];W[sl]LB[sl:54][ro:A][ho:B]C[Now A seemed to small but again I  couldn't
find any good moves against the white
group in the center.

Later-on I though I should have played  B.
white would be forced to flee in the  center
with his group but I'm not sure.

Q: Any suggestions here? How should
black continue his attack?

black lost his good position, with this  combination; the main disadvantage is  that the white group on the right is now  completely save while black is not  absolutely alive.]

;B[ho]C[I thought I can use this to connect but  white
turned out to be much stronger here.


I find really no good way for black, white  breaks into blacks sphere of influence,  this very terrible]
;W[im];B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[gp];B[gn];W[gm];B[hl]C[I didn't feel like letting white
waltz out directly.

Q: Is this o.k.?

it is not, but for the time being there is  no resist.];W[hm]
;B[fn];W[gl];B[ij];W[gk];B[hj];W[el]LB[el:80][dl:C][dk:A][cl:B]
C[White group has a lot of aji to live on it's
own now so I thought white will play C.
When he didn't I answered quickly at C.

Its hard to say if white can be killed, I  would say no, so black must to  something on the left side. White B will  be dangerous for black.

C is not the best choice; A or B looks  better]
(;B[dl];W[em];B[ep];W[eq];B[hq]C[why?];W[gq]C[I think this was an error by white...

yes; but not so terrible];B[hr];W[ir]C[Now white has a harder time living with  his
central group.

hart to say; i think white is alive];B[dp];W[dk];B[ck];W[ek]

(;B[bn]LB[bn:93][cq:D]C[Big mistake.

Q: I should have played D immediately
right?

D is big but its endgame];W[cj];B[cl];W[di];B[ej];W[fi];B[ci]
;W[bj]LB[bj:10][ei:D]C[I wondered about this too. I expected  white
D.

yes it lose some points];B[ei];W[eh];B[dh]LB[dh:10][fj:E]C[Q: Should I have pushed at E first?

It is usually a bad idea but it does create
cutting points so I may get sente here.

yes thats right];W[fj];B[di];W[ro]C[It is certainly big and at the time it did
scare me so I made a mistake.]
(;B[mk]C[to small]
(;W[ll]C[I wonder that white connects]
(;B[cq]LB[cq:10][hc:A][jc:B][ph:C][rc:D]C[Because of W106 I decided to take these
stones to make up some territory. But now
I think it is too small. My suggestions
range from A-D but I just can't decide. I do
feel I fell behind already and I don't see a
good way to attack the white center group.

Q: Any ideas for B109?];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[ni];B[oi]
C[Since I'm behind I didn't want to answer
submissively.

:-)];W[oh];B[pi];W[ng]C[But I guess white read it out better.]

about white E but I decided to go for it
anyway...

(;B[lc]C[I felt I was behind so I decided to put up  a
fight but...

Q: This should have been at w138 right?

I think this lost the game.

My territorial assessment was:
white 45 pts +komi
black 40 pts

Q: Does that sound right?

This move was a big mistake and I  would say it loses the game.
For the territorial question see the  variation.];W[nc];B[nb]

went wrong. I'd appreciate your  comments
on these issues.

Thank you.

I see only one of your games, but I have  the feeling that the different of strength  is not so great.
I know some players which lose there  games because the can not wait to win  and play more risky than necessary.
You can not expect to finish you  opponent with one blow.

I hope you can use something
