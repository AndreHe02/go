C[I want you to comment some moves wish I defined after & some other moves wish you want because i dont know what some move mean. and thank you [sorry for my bad english, I speak french : ) \]

-----

No problem, I understand very well!

This game is a bit odd for me to review for two reasons.  First, your opponent is a computer, which makes it harder to figure out what it's trying to do at any given point.

Second, you won by a substantial margin, so it may be harder to find good places to explore variations.

I'll give it my best shot!  General comments on the game as a whole follow, and then I'll add additional information at various points throughout the game.

--------

I noticed that there were no large group captures in the game, which indicates black has reasonably good fighting skills.  Against a computer opponent like white this is good, particularly for a beginner.  Black played overconservatively in spots and did not always play the largest move on the board which cut the margin down a bit.

White's play was erratic.  Several opportunities it had (some of which you pointed out) it squandered on very inferior moves.  The exchange in the late midgame in the middle of the board might have come close to losing the game right there.  White's fighting skills were weak although it made good shape when given a chance, which made it pretty easy for it to survive.]

C[At this point it seems that black could make good inroads against white by playing in the corner.  Some possible variations follow...]

(;B[cd];W[cc]C[Good shape for white.];B[bc];W[cb];B[ef];W[fe]
C[_Very_ good shape for white.];B[ff];W[ge]C[White is very content to take fifth-line territory here.]
;B[cj]C[With Black's wall and shimari a play on the fourth line might be just as safe and slightly more profitable.]
;W[qe];B[hq];W[mq];B[oq]LB[qj:A]C[This seems small.  A might have been larger.]
;W[qm]C[Now black is hard pressed to make an invasion live on the right.]
;B[qo]C[I think the corner is still vulnerable even with this move.  I can't read out a variation that works but a good white player would certainly have room to set up a ko and maybe get life outright.  This is not a recommended configuration for black in the corner.]
;W[qj];B[jc]LB[kc:A]C[Too close to white's massive wall.  I'd have tried A.]
;W[lo];B[nc]TR[qj][qm]SQ[jq][mq]C[that move

This is too far of an extension on the third line.  In general, a two-point extension (like the marked stones) is safe on the third line.  In other words, the opponent cannot cut it.  A three-point extension is too far.  The opponent can cut the stones apart by playing in the center, as you see.]
;W[lc]C[The cutting move.];B[lb]LB[ld:A]SQ[jc][nc]C[that move

One of the other of these stones is going to die if white plays intelligently.  Playing below the cutting stone says that you are preparing to play low with the survivor and try to live against the edge of the board.  You could also play at A, above the cutting stone, and try to build an outside position with the surviving stone.  Note that if white gets the outside here he will have a large moyo to try to build territory with.

See variation for how I might play as white.]
(;W[kc];B[kb];W[jd];B[ic];W[ke]C[White apparently decided not to try to cut you apart, but rather to get strong on the outside.  I question this decision.]
;B[fb];W[hd]C[White's position in the upper left is unkillable, so he lets black take it.

White's move here is dual-purpose, which is good.  It helps to connect white's groups, and it also threatens to cut upwards to isolate black.]

I might have played at A instead.  It looks to me as if black is alive anyway and can attempt to cut down to try to escape to the center.  See last turn's possible variation.  The move as played will work though.]
;W[fq]C[White cuts black's three-point extension here as well.]
;B[fp]C[that move

-- 

Playing on top tries to establish center strength.  It's a reasonable move here.]
;W[ad];B[bd];W[no];B[qh]LB[rg:A][oh:B][ri:C]C[that move

-- 

Black cuts white's position on the side.  White is pretty strong here so normally I would try to push black up into the center and make territory on the side and in the corner, or cap and try to kill.  I would likely try for A, B, or C.]

;B[pg]C[Black pushes out and has a chance to either escape into the center or live.]
;W[of];B[db]C[This move is pretty small.  There are many more moves that would stake a claim to much more territory.  Also, the black group on the right side is not fully secure yet.]
;W[dc];B[ca];W[bb];B[ac];W[gd]C[Very weak move for white.  There was no urgency there at all as far as I can see.]
;B[ri]LB[rg:A]C[Good, black should be pretty secure now.  There may still be a weak spot at A but if white plays there black can escape into the center.]
