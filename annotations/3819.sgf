C[* Hello, I'm white in this game. What I'd really appreciate is multiple move suggestions along the way marked with A, B, C, etc. and then some details about the flaws or virtues about each choice (some even intentionally inferior but "looks good" to trick me?). Kind-of like whole-board multiple choice problems, if you know what I mean. Thank you. :)

[DLW\]
Game reviewed by DimitriLW (5k* on IGS).  Comments will be preceeded by "[DLW\]".

I will do my best to provide move suggestions.  While I cannot promise perfectly correct suggestions (who can??), I can offer ideas and food-for-thought which will hopefully help you in your quest for an improved go game.

[DLW: copy of closing comments\]
My thought is that W could not decide if he was invading, or reducing.  When placing a stone, it is ideal to place a stone that both invades and reduces, however be ready to make a decision which role the stone falls into when pressured by the opponent.  If W feels uncomfortable with flat-out invading B's moyo, then life-and-death problems can make a significant improvement in understanding how to invade and survive the process.

Also, W consistently over-extends.  There are too many stones that are placed in awkward situations, thus giving B a "free" play.  Along with the over-extended stones, there are a few stones that are flat-out "gimme" stones.  Gote play is dangerous; B has sente too often.  Just remember the value of sente and always ask yourself whether a play is sente or gote prior to placing the stone.

Overall, I believe that W demonstrates great potential for improvement, and I look forward to the day when W is offering game reviews to me.  :)]

;B[jq]TR[pd][qj][po]C[* Which one is best? Is black already ahead at this point?

[DLW\]
I think I prefer a W stone around R10.  Is this correct?  I am too weak to know, but it is my personal preference.

Q5 is too close to B's side, and invites a pincer which will allow B to push W around while building strength.

Q16 feels like it merely forces B to secure territory, without developing a solid group for W.]
;W[pd];B[qf]SQ[re][qe]C[* How in the world is white supposed to play here? Of course I naively expected R16 or Q17. I don't really know any joseki.

[DLW\]
I am also weak in joseki.  I looked in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, and did not find this play anywhere.  Kogo's does list B plays at either R15 or S15, but not at R14.  

Again, I am not the best person to answer joseki questions, however I feel that B has extended too far.  W can divide these two stones with a stone at R16.]

(;W[pc];B[qd]C[[DLW\]
Now B's R14 appears perfectly placed, and W's two stones look very weak.]
;W[lc]C[[DLW\]
I think this is one space too far.  You are too deep in B's strength to allow the threat of a peep.]
;B[ne]C[[DLW\]
...and there's the threat of a peep.];W[qb];B[nc]C[[DLW\]
B has opted to give W the corner, realizing that it will be very small and contained.  This hurts W very much, as B ends up with a very strong presence on the outside.]
;W[rc];B[ob];W[rd];B[qe];W[pb];B[re];W[sb];B[of]C[[DLW\]
Now we can see that W's corner is complete, but for minimal territory.  B's wall is significant, both on the right side of the board, and on the top.  This has played out very well for B.]
;W[le]C[* Should I just sacrifice? (And play on the right side?) I really hate ending up in this kind of situation. Usually I try to get the other guy to invade me first.

[DLW\]
I think W is correct, in hindsight, to think that it would be better to work on the right side.  In time, the M17 stone can be treated as a sacrifice, and you can threaten to give it life, thus reducing B's area.  However, placing the stone at M15 makes the two stones heavy, and forces W to commit to them.  This allows B to push the stones around, and build a solid framework for a large territory.]
;B[je];W[lg];B[qn]C[[DLW\]
I would prefer to see B continue to push the W stones for another stone or two.  However this is very big also.]
;W[oo]C[* I'm at a loss. I already feel like I'm losing (only one moyo plus a weak group to worry about) and everything is spinning out of control, so I do weird things like this.

[DLW\]
This play does feel desperate.  It reduces B, however you are forcing him to solidify his group while simultaneously offering another weak group to attack.  It looks like B could opt to divide the two weak groups, and seek to capture one of them, should the game play out in that direction.]
;B[om]C[[DLW\]
Nice.  Now B's right side is looking large and the W stone looks very vulnerable.]
;W[nq]C[[DLW\]
I do not think that this works.  If you want to commit to saving the P5 stone, then it requires something around N5 as a run for freedom.]
;B[gq]C[[DLW\]
Since the two W stones in the right corner are weak, I would prefer to see something around M3 first, that will force a W response, then this stone (or something completely different) is still available.]
;W[jo]C[[DLW\]
Over extended.  B can easily seperate the K stone from the O&P stones.]
;B[go]C[[DLW\]
B is timid here.  This stone should be around the M line, dividing the K stone from the O&P stones.]
;W[jm];B[mh]C[* Definitely losing now.

[DLW\]
It appears so.];W[jg];B[kf];W[lf];B[kg];W[lh];B[kh];W[li];B[ni]
;W[ok]C[[DLW\]
Another deep placement.  If you really want this one, go for life inside the black walls by playing on the third line.  While I am only a 5k, I believe that it is possible, although at what price to the rest of the board, I am uncertain.]

[DLW\]
Yes.];B[do]C[[DLW\]
B also plays a silly gote stone.]
(;W[cr]C[* Gote and unnecessary?

[DLW\]
Correct.  See what could happen locally if you play elsewhere.]

C[* Gonna discard the rest as it isn't interesting. Black's engame is much more careful and deliberate than mine so he ends up winning by more than 30 points.
