C[CaeZaR: I haven't played many games (<20) but I'm starting to get the feel for things. A review would be appreciated. I chose this game because the fighting was interesting and I don't know if I handled it correctly.

Overall play is ok, focus on choosing your battles.  Don't fight everywhere there's a possibility; fight when the result will be good for you.  Every few turns, take stock of the board and ask "Where are the moyos?  Who controls what?"  I hope my comments help, please email me if you have any questions.

THN];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[jp]TR[fq]C[Try F3 instead.  It's a little more aggressive.]
;W[jj];B[dj]TR[fc]C[C: I was willing to exchange hoshi with my opponent considering I would get the last one.

Hoshi usually refers to the 44 point, not any handicap point.  In most games, the handicap points have no special significance; they're not necessarily good moves just because they're on the handicap points.  Here I'd rather play F17.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cf]TR[dm]C[This split doesn't help you.  You create two weak black stones for one weak white stone.  Play D7 or somewhere similar.  This helps your black stone under attack, and forces white to play C14 instead, leading to cluttered stones.]
;W[bf]
(;B[df]C[C: Good/Bad?

Bad, but this cut has already made things bad for black.  I've put down variations closer to what I would play from here.  White let's black off easy.]

;W[ce];B[de];W[be];B[bd];W[ed];B[cc]C[C: Is a move in the corner necessary (I think yes)? Is this the right choice (I'm not sure)?

Yes, a corner move is necessary.];W[ej];B[di];W[bg];B[fj]LB[bi:A]
C[C: This should be at 'A' correct?

Yes.];W[gh];B[ek];W[gj];B[jc];W[aj];B[bi];W[ai];B[bj];W[bk]

[eg:B]C[C: Threatening 'A' and 'B'.

White doesn't need B, so you're really just threatening A.]
;W[fe];B[eg]TR[fd]C[No, play F16 and try to take the corner.  Or if you are afraid of losing the fight, be safe and play D17.]
;W[gf];B[fh]C[Very small move.  Worth 2 points in gote, and has almost no effect on the rest of the board.]
;W[gi];B[ff]C[Same as move 53.];W[dc];B[fd];W[cb];B[db];W[ec]
;B[bb];W[eb];B[ca];W[ea];B[da]C[C: Not necessary, right?

Nope.  You're very lucky White didn't play F17.]

;W[jb];B[kb];W[ic];B[jd];W[jf];B[ie]LB[hd:A][gg:B]C[C: I'm trying to exploit cutting point 'A' in order to use the weakness at 'B', but I don't really have a plan.

That is a plan.  It's ok just to push enemy stones around if it strengthens your wall, as it does here.]
;W[hd];B[gg];W[hg];B[fg];W[if];B[kf];W[le]C[C: This stone starts a big fight. Any insight would be appreciated.

You're too greedy here.  Start with N16, connecting your stones.  Then the fight moves to the right side.]

Neither your group nor his is unconditionally alive.  You will probably win the capturing race though.]

You are both neglecting the right side of the board.A play at Q10 or R6 could be very big for either player.]
