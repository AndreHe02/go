Hi -- I am black in this game.  My opponent is 2d* on IGS, which
is at least two stones stronger than me.  I feel I played well
in the opening but fell apart in the middle game.  I have included
comments where I thought they may be useful to you.  Thank you
for the game review.];B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[jp]C[[chingu\]:
I would prefer a direct approach move at one of white's corners.]
;W[cf];B[dj]C[[chingu\]:
Possible, but this move does not have a strong pincer effect due to his distance. Thus it is easy for white to settle things here.]
;W[fc];B[ee]TR[fd]C[[chingu\]:
This looks like a handicap game move. More common is to attach at the marked spot (F16).]
;W[ch]
(;B[cj]C[[chingu\]:
Blocking here immediately feels too early. White will seperate the corner which then is difficult to settle effectively. Better play as in the variation (see last move).]
;W[fh];B[fk]C[
Choosing between this and G15 was tough.

[chingu\]:
G15 is more important. White should not get the opportunity to shut the black group in. This shows the weakness of black C10.
F10 is better shape localy.];W[id];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg];W[dh];B[cg]
;W[bg]C[[chingu\]:
This kind of moves is usually not good for black, he takes his own liberties. If he plays this way, he should cut with his next move.]

C[[chingu\]:
Wrong direction. Always play from your weaker side (e.g. L11). Now black pushes white against his own weak group.]
;W[ki];B[mi]C[[chingu\]:
Just playing at N13 looks better.];W[lh];B[ng]C[[chingu\]:
Attacking here looks couragous as long as the black corner group is not settled.]

;B[nd];W[of];B[nf];W[og];B[ke]TR[ie]C[I did not like making this move but felt it was necessary to
proect against a splitting move like H13.

[chingu\]:
Defending at J15 is almost  sente for black.];W[oi];B[nq]C[
I was happy to have the opportunity to get this move in, but
perhaps I should have just invaded on the right?

[chingu\]:
Hm, difficult to say. This move seems natural enough.];W[np]
;B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[pq];B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[lm]C[
This move by white surprised me.  I thought it was an overplay
but I did not manage to get anything from it.

[chingu\]:
Looks tough but black also has to be very careful. Cutting will cause black a shortage of liberties so exploiting white's thinness is not easy.]
;B[nn];W[mm];B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[on]C[[chingu\]:
Have a look at the variation for a possible follow-up.]
(;B[pn];W[om];B[mq]C[[chingu\]:
This is certainly a move one would like to make, but settling the two stones on right side looks more urgent.]

the entire lower left to be in the game -- hence the aggressive
move.];W[co];B[bn];W[bp];B[dr];W[cr]
(;B[ar]C[
In retrospect this looks to be a mistake -- maybe D6 is ok.

[chingu\]:
This move is not necessary now. White has one eye at most in the corner.
It is important now that black plays solidly on the outside to prevent a second eye.]
;W[aq];B[br];W[do]C[[chingu\]:
Please note that white still has one eye in the corner. (see variation).]

Here I sadly resign, knowing that if I had an opportunity it
went away after my play in the lower right.

[chingu\]:
You played quite well throughout the game. Have a look at the variation I presented for the lower right.
All in all it is most important that you defend your weak groups earlier.]

If black really wants to attack he has to play this way. Otherwise his two last moves  lose much of their meaning.]

The fight becomes more difficult but white seems to have the better position since black will soon have to defend his corner group to ensure life.]
