;B[pd]C[Hi
I'm white and I'd like to know more what went wrong in this game.
I can hardly find big misstake.
I guess more likely the strategy failed.
I end up with too many weaks groups while black was quite safe.]
;W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq]C[Playing at K4 as you did next is to small.]

(;W[jp]C[White should have played where black played next ( I would assume
when you where playing Black played there without hesitation)
The reason is is at this point R10 is HUGE..];B[qj]C[You see how R10 is so huge? Go back a couple moves and look at
the difference if you played here first.];W[nc];B[lc];W[qf]
;B[nd]C[This is a good move by black!];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re]
;W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[nb]C[This was a foolish move.. This is like giving white a handicap
stone.];W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[lb];W[na];B[jc]C[Already at this point the game has become difficult for white
as he has allowed black to build this enourmous moyo at the bottom.
I think if I was W I would have played P10 next (see variation)]

(;W[le];B[pf];W[ec]C[spaciane - I didn't see better option even if I knew black would
easily  stabilise his group with g17.
I thought d4 would then be a good folow up.

E17 is okay but look at the moyo black is building at the bottom.
There is a GO proverb not sure of the exact wording but the basic
gist of it is, "Never let your opponent perfect his moyo" You
have time and time again in this game allowed your opponent to
perfect his moyo];B[gc];W[dj];B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp]
;W[er];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[cg];B[eg];W[id]C[spaciane- I had to try something,]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[gd];W[hc]C[spaciane- this move would have been better at h14 , I think.Keeping
the option of a peep at h18 later.];B[hb];W[jd];B[kc];W[jf]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf]C[spaciane - this is probably too defencing]

C[spaciane- At that point I was a bit desperate.Going for desperate
try.

Well this might have worked if you could have attacked the 3
marked black stones. But black can simply connect to his group
on the right.   White you must remember that in go you cannot go outright and
take territory. You must make your stones work more efficent
than that. The only way to do this is to make territory while
attacking. If you practice this idea you will lose many games.
But in losing you will learn to get the more subtlke ideas of
making territory while attacking.   You should learn what splitting attacks, leaning attacks are.
These two simple concepts are very important and are covered
in many go books. I would suggest Attack and Defence.];B[qm]

;W[ej];B[dh];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi]C[Why didn't you block here instead? This would have saved you
a larger headache.

Though not directly applicable here you must remember to "Force
before you defend" i.e the idea is if you must make a defensice
move. If there is a forcing move that you can make before you
defend in the local situation you should force. Otherwise your
opponent may be able to fix his position and you will lose the
forcing move.];B[bh];W[bg];B[ah];W[bl];B[bm];W[bk];B[el];W[gi]
;B[ii];W[hi];B[ih];W[ij];B[kh]TR[fi]C[Ignoring the white atari on the Black stone was wise of black.
You must learn to see when a stone is important or not. Sometimes
(many times) putting atari on a stone is useless. If that stone
is not a cutting stone and does not have any strategic or tactical
merit your opponent can afford to lose it. Think if you take
that stone it is only worth two points. Can your opponent make
a move elsewhere that is larger than two points?];W[lg];B[lh]

cost you mush as black responed to them each time so mathematically
it worked out to the same. But you destryed any aji you may have
had. Don't play moves just becuase you can you must have a strategy
in go at all times. No stones can ever go to waste. Yo must get
the most out of every stone you play.];B[jh];W[jj];B[jq];W[cs]

;B[ao]C[The biggest mistake white made in this game is not following
the proverb of attacking your opponent by attacking his strategy.
Here black strategy was to make a moyo on the bottom. White kept
in lettting black make his moyo get stronger and stronger.

They key mistake in this game in my opinion was letting black
play R10 early on in the game. Had white played this point the
game would have been wholly different.


Sorry it took so long to get this review to you. I got called
out of town for a few days. To make it up to you you can send
another game to me and I will review it must quicker. Take care
and rememember some basics..

Make territory by attacking

Learn splitting and leaning attacks

frustrate your opponents game by attacking his strategy

don't let your opponent perfect his moyo

don't play aji-keshi moves (don't ruin potential)

be flexiable

don't take territory directly all the time

study the book Attack and Defence.. You will gain 3 stones guaranteed,]
)
(;W[oj]LB[ph:a][pl:b][mj:c]C[Now black could play at a,b, or c (there are many other moves
but lets look at these)   If black plays at a that is just what white would love. This
would be a totally overconcentrated position

If black plays at b he builds up some nice territory at the bottom
but w can play lightly in this area and reduce some of the power
of this moyo

if black plays at c (A move I would play) then white is in for
a difficult fight but I think should do okay if he doesn't get
to attached to all his stones in this area i.e he uses a sacrifice
strategy to make sabaki.

The point of the matter here is so important for white to understand.
He missed a very basic fuskei point early on in the game. Now
the rest of the game will be a struggle becuase of this.]))
(;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]C[You see now black doesn't get that perfect moyo. Get out of this
variation go back to the main line and look at another variation
stored there. It is in this variatio  where I show why letting
B get this point is so bad.  Black could play many points at
this point but if I was black I think I would play E16]))
