;B[nq];W[pq];B[np]C[Good result  for black or overconcentrated ?

klin: B OK.];W[nc];B[ro];W[qo]C[klin: W R5 should simply S4.  In the future W may have Q5  R6.]

;B[df];W[eb]C[klin: W E18 should E14.  It is complicated.];B[fb]
;W[db];B[fe]
(;W[fd]C[I've seen the variation as joseki. What about this ?

klin: I have not seen this before.  I will say B can take at E14.  Giving up the F18 stone is not bad.]
;B[fc]C[Good choice ? Black gets ponnuki, but the corner is very big.

klin: No, the corner is too big.];W[ef]C[klin: B can fight by E13, W F14, B D13.  W has the advantage, but B has some chances.]
;B[gd];W[eg]C[klin: I will say W is better here.];B[ob];W[nb]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[qh]C[Not so good for white I think. Eliminates all possibilities in the corner.

klin: The corner is B's anyway.  Nevertheless, W is too greedy.]
;B[qf];W[qk];B[kc];W[lc];B[le];W[ld]C[I didn't know how to attack best any further, so switched to other place on the board.

klin: B M15 peeks at N15 a little bit better.  B could play at S10 to chase out the right side W group, and double-attack.]
;B[be]C[How best to exploit the aji in this corner ?
 I was afraid that if white gets to play around C 10,  nothing will be possible any more on the upper left side.

klin: B could play at C11, If W C12, B B12, B13, then C8.];W[bd]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh];B[ci];W[bf];B[bi];W[ag];B[cl];W[dr]
;B[bn];W[co];B[hq]C[H4 better ?

klin: Yes, or G4.];W[bo];B[nf];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf]
C[klin: Now W is alive easily.  This is the reason that M15 was not as good as N15.]
;B[ne]C[Aji Keshi or not ?

klin: O15 no need.];W[ke];B[pi];W[qi];B[pk];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh]
;B[ni];W[rl];B[pl];W[rj]C[klin: B let W get off too easily.  B Q11 should come from below (S10, for example).]
;B[jl]C[Always the difficult question: is this the right place to take some profit in the center ?

klin: Too conservative. (but safe :-))];W[kk];B[kl];W[mk];B[lk]
;W[jn];B[in];W[io];B[jo];W[im];B[hn]C[This turns on to be an overplay. From here on things go wrong for me.]
;W[jm];B[ln]C[klin:  Even with B's conservative move, W still tries to come in. :-)]
;W[kn]
(;B[lm];W[ko]C[klin: B losses points here.  However, If B plays at G8 or H9 now, W group may be killed.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[gl];W[hm];B[gm];W[ik];B[il]C[klin: This apparently doesn't work.  Should attack from further away.  For example, K12, or F11.]

(;B[lo];W[ll];B[lj];W[lm]C[klin: B should attack from out side.  For example, G8.  W has no time to connect at L7.]

(;B[km];W[jk];B[il]C[klin: It is a ladder.])
(;B[jk];W[km];B[gm];W[ik];B[jj];W[hm];B[gl];W[hk]C[klin: Keep chasing at F10.  Now you can see how bad was O15.  B would have L13, the atari at K14, W's group may not be able to conncet.]
