Hi and thanks to whoever is going to review this game!! :)
I've had a little break from GO but in my opinion this game was ok.
I'll point out some points i want you to comment (well.. not so many anyways :P)
And also i'd like a comment if my play in the beginning is ok.

(;B[ph]LB[pf:A]C[Is this okay? Or Q11 better?

[Broege: A very natural move here is A. See the variants for typical continuations.\]]
;W[ql];B[rj]LB[qj:A]C[[Broege: Playing at A would attack White stronger while protecting Black group more.\]]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[pj];B[dj]LB[rk:A][pm:B]C[I thought that this would be a good move and there wouldn't be much to lose in the right side group. Well not sure about it anyways :P

[Broege: The right-side Black group is quite safe now. Perhaps a move chasing White right-side group into the center (like A or B) should be played first.

The general idea of leaving right side and creating influence elsewhere is correct.\]]
;W[pi];B[rh];W[fq]
(;B[hp]LB[fo:C][eq:A][hq:B]C[Any better moves here?

[Broege: Third line moves seem better here.
Playing at A would aim at closing the corner and making White live between Black D4 and L4 stones.
Playing at B would force White into the corner or into the center.
Playing at C would force White to live small while taking profit on the left side. See the variations.
After White C Black cannot do much - White can slide in both directions and run into the center if needed.\]]

(;B[cq]LB[fo:A]C[[Broege: Perhaps playing at A and cutting off White group from the center would be better. Black begins to create a big moyo and White has to live in the corner - see the variation.\]]

Well that would leave an option for him to play P3 or around that :O

[Broege: Yes, it's a tough choice as Black would like to play on both of these points.
Personally I would choose A but that's only a matter of individual preferences.\]]
;W[nc];B[ef]LB[ee:A]C[Dunno about this move... quess it seemed good at that moment.

[Broege: This move does not threaten White. The move only forces White to play A (as in the game) which removes any weaknesses from White wall.\]]

C[[Broege: This move is not necessary (as were a few other moves which over-secured Black territory).
It is very important that one knows which securing moves are necessary (and makes them) and which are not - as making them not only does take a point from own score but also gives initiative to the opponent.\]]

[Broege: Overall it was a good game. Both Black and White played on the large scale and tried to create huge territories.
Many actual moves played while making these territories were incorrect - but what counts is a plan for the game.
Of course one has to try to play all the moves better and better - I hope that few of the more straigthforward errors I marked and sequences accompanying them will help you to play better.\]]
