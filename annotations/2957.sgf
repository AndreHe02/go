C[-hi my name is lect, i will be reviewing your game. i currently play on KGS
- comments are made for black];B[pc];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[qe]
;W[jd];B[qn]C[- this stone is played on the wrong side. O3 would be better as it works with D4 stone and offers a more interesting option(s)]
;W[nq]
(;B[pk]C[- not the best move. this is why R6 was not the right choice, because you will have to end in gote to form a decent shape.

- in this situation, S4 is joseki];W[jp];B[gq]C[- wrong direction, play C6 or C7. now is not the time to provoke fights, plus C6/C7 prevents white from dominating the left side]
;W[cn];B[co]C[- contact plays in this situation force W to form a strong shape. avoid contact plays. your shape is still very open to attack because of G3. it should be one line closer at F3]
;W[dn];B[ci]C[Maybe C10 is better or perhaps D10 for "easy" escape to the center?]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc]C[- ok];B[lc]C[- overplay. N17 much better]
;W[jc]C[What about this move? Wouldn't it be best to tenuki?
Is there a better move for this respond?

- N17 would've been better than M17. this move allowed W to fix some weak points. you can tenuki here, but for now M17 is a floating (and wasted) stone]
;B[di]C[- rule of thumb: dont attack until your groups are settled. this is a wasted move because W can reply at C3 or E3, or just escape. also, W does not have much (if anything) in the center right now.]
;W[cq];B[bo];W[er];B[dq]C[- best not to force W to connect. also, be wary of ladders in this type of situation]

(;B[qh];W[pb]C[- you're in a dilemma now. this is a result of the weak stone at M17. if your stone were at N17, then killing it wouldnt have been a problem. now you should cut your losses and consider M17 expendable]

(;B[oc]C[Here I went wrong, was there a way to kill that stone? Or maybe M15 or M16 would prove a very nice follow-up move.
