;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qi];B[qo]C[Of course, there are alwas arguments wether this should be played here or not.The point is : now B has 25  undisputable points, and W none.

: And?

: You prefer to get point in the begining?

: It's a strategy, but there are plenty others];W[kq];B[cn]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[I did not want to enter the corner, since this is too good for WNeither play E6, which seems to be despised by good players.]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[fp];B[mq]C[The left stones can be left alone now with C9 pendingN3 afterwards looks bad, because the exchange favors W too much.Probably a play at H3/J3 was better ?

: the black group on the left is not settled: it can be the key point of the game: if white get sente and attack hardly this group, black can have hard time]
;W[ip];B[qg];W[ql];B[ck]C[again, this was stupid.I offerd a splendid drive to W !]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[bj];B[bl]C[: Play atari E9 before B8

: Play atari E9 before B8];W[dj];B[fc]C[: I don't like this move because with the white 3 stone on the middle left the pincer seems natural. So black will have hard time here.

: I prefer to play K17 to extend the black corner. The 3-3 in the upper left is still open so there are yet possibilities]

;W[rj];B[ri]MA[eh][ho][lg]C[I think this is a fault :in terms of territory,B has  45 points5 upper left15 bottom left (included sente on the white stone)15 bottom right10 upper right before S11W has 45 points18 top10 left17 bottom5 rightIn terms of influence, B has the advantage, and the sente now.My understanding of how to use influence is not very firm now, but I thinks I should have "used" it, instead of S11 (10 points gote, with S9 follow up)The point is : how ?There is no weak W group now.My ideas com to the marked points, with the follow ups consisting in continuing to build something in the centre.or is the game already settled, because my influence is now worhless ?

: has you must know, points in the center are very expensive: many stones for few points

: Here it will be hard for black to get point in the center because all the white groups are strong (alive) and some black groups can be attacked in the upper and right side

: it seems it is time to yose. At the moment of thz game nobody can say who will win.]
;W[jf]C[This surprised me.Normally, there should not be any problem to cope with this stone, because B support is more efficient than W.Am I wrong ?on the other hand, the B top gourp is not yet settled.

: Strong move, white may have prepared with G14 before

: just one thing to understand: black is not alive!];B[if]C[I did not put the variations I surveyed, but none is satisfactory.Any better idea ?]
