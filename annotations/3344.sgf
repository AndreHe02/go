C[Hello,

I'm playing here as black. I won the game but I was losing until the very end. It represents the problems I seem to have in many games, opponent getting the center and my groups getting chased. I have to improve my tactics and reading, but strategic choices are what I find the hardest to improve.

Thank you for all your comments.

david> I will do my best to guide you :-)];B[pd];W[pp];B[cp]
;W[dd];B[eq];W[pj];B[jc];W[cj];B[jq];W[mq]C[Often my problems start when the opponent plays first to the sides and create a moyo.]

(;B[fc]C[david> I would try to play C14 or D14 instead, a black stone at C8 later makes a pincer on the C10 stone (see variation)]
;W[dg]C[unleash: Now C17 is very tempting but I find it not urgent.]
;B[cl]C[unleash: I was thinking about being able to invade around C11 so I did this.

david> This move isn't really sente, you give white the initiative, you could play first a move like D18 which attacks white corner and defend your top at the same time]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[pm];B[qp]C[unleash: Difficult strategical choice for me. Was it too early?

david> no invasion of bottom right corner is a good thing to do at this time I think]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[po];B[rq];W[qr];B[rm];W[rl];B[qm];W[ql];B[rr]
;W[hq]C[unleash: Now white has thickness and K3 seems bad. Maybe helping K3 was urgent? However, I chose something else.

david> trying to reduce ennemy territory by playing right in the middle of his framework is not very good, I would say h3 was a white mistake, and you responded by a mistake with playing r12. h3 invades your territory you have to respond and attack his stone! your left group is strong, and you have ther initiative]

;B[oj];W[pk];B[mj];W[ml]C[You helped white to secure his right side, make his bottom right stronger, making the white h3 stone even more a priority. your 3 stones in center aren't safe yet as well, your mistake was R12]
;B[cc]C[I would play k4, but with what just happened earlier the fight will be more difficult for black]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[kj]C[unleash: This seems horrible for black. It attack the P10 group, k3 stone and probably helps making territory. So I think I already made a mistake somewhere. Or what do you think?

david> yes, I think this is not good for black, however white should have played L10 at L9, black can go through at M9, but, it is very difficult to do so without hurting k3 more, so I don't advise you to play M9. I would play O12 (see variation)]

(;B[mh];W[kh];B[mf];W[of];B[ng];W[og];B[ip]C[david: you can consider yourself very lucky white didn't play this before you... white should have ignored your O13, and play J4]

;W[pr];B[ps];W[os];B[rs];W[or]C[at this point you are a bit ahead... maybe you should play a move like l14, if you have the chance to cut white at l9 next you have very good chance to win the game]

(;B[bd];W[be];B[ed]C[better to simply play B17];W[bc];B[de]
;W[ce];B[bb];W[ad];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[lq]C[david: you should have played m3 right after m2... menacing white to enter his framework and defending at the same time. White should have attacked at L2, not M3

A this point, sacrifice m2 stone, and play L13 or K14]

;B[fl]C[david: white really played desesperate moves (not working), he should focus on reduce territory in a way that works instead of playing suicide moves like that :-)

;W[sj];B[si]C[unleash: But there actually was something for black. White resigns.

david: you were not losing all alone, you were in trouble after play R12, but white didn't take his chance on the bottom side... after that.. black has been ahead until the end, and even had chances to make this game an easy wi,.

I hope my comments helped you.])
