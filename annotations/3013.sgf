C[I'm white in this game.  Thanks for reviewing!

[Hi! i'm wjzz and now i'm 10k at KGS. i will try to answer your questions, mark some bad moves, and show you thing you might know ;-) I'll also comment some of blacks moves, maybe you'll find it useful \]]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[nq]LB[qk:A]C[usually white plays a, become black move at A would be a double extension. it'd be like to have two moves in one.]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[jq]LB[lq:A]C[this move leaves a weekness at A, which black can exploit, lets say, 15-25 moves later]
;B[fd]LB[ce:B][de:C][ci:A]C[i guess there's no need to play like this. pros and dan players use this move when there is a white stone at A, which makes b or C a bit dangerous.]
;W[de];B[jc];W[qi]C[good move];B[qg];W[ql];B[qm];W[oi];B[og]
;W[no]LB[ci:A][mi:C][pl:D][eq:B]C[i would choose a,b,c or d instead, but in my opinion its not a bad move.]
;B[cj];W[cm];B[cg];W[cf];B[dg];W[fq]LB[cd:A][qk:B]TR[fb][kd]
[dk]C[So at the end of fuseki, I think it's about even.  Maybe I'm a little ahead.

[well, now u have two week groups, black a can become troublesome, becose later A can become very hard to catch\]

[i marked some places, where i'd like to play in chuban\]];B[cq]
;W[bq]TR[cp][fq]C[I probably should have gone to d3 instead

[well, i'm not good at ogeima shimari (the triangled formation) but when u have played this shimari you can't consider it as a sure teritorry. if it was everyone would use it ;-) \]]
;B[dq];W[dp];B[br];W[bp];B[eq];W[ep];B[fr]C[I think at this point there isn't anything I can do to kill it, so I decided to build up thinkness instead and seal in black with as little territory as possible.]
;W[cs];B[dr];W[bs]
(;B[ds]C[its a mistake, A2 works for example];W[ar]
(;B[cr]C[second mistake, its only two or 3 stones!];W[es];B[er]

(;W[gr]C[this leaves too many weekness. if u had played like in the varation you;d killed it ;-)]
;B[fs];W[gs];B[as];W[gp];B[aq];W[ap];B[ar]C[This wall becomes vital later on.]
;W[fl]C[I was just trying to claim some territory, but this allowed me to prevent black from getting into the middle since he didn't really respond to this.]

(;B[bl]C[I think a black move at f10 is a lot better?

[well, i think black should concerns on the right side and then at white center\]]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[bf];W[be];B[bg]
(;W[df]C[Not sure why I did this.  Maybe I was paranoid that I wouldn't have enough space in the corner to live.  I think a move at p8 or O7 would have been good.]
;B[ej];W[fj]C[That f8 stone I played earlier now lets me push upwards and prevent black from getting into the middle.]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[mh];B[mf]C[lo];W[kh]C[black is in big problem]

(;B[qr]C[A black keima at O7 seems vital to get something in the middle.]
;W[ol];B[eb];W[db];B[ec];W[nm]C[I think after this move, the game is pretty much over.]
;B[jf];W[gh];B[jh];W[ji];B[kg]C[probably too passive for black]

[go][jo][hp][ip][jp][lp][mp]C[[black is playing a bit desparately. but white has a solid lead :

white:
left upper corner  11 points
center : about 97 
prisoners 3 
komi 6,5

all = 117,5

black
down left = 3
down right= 21
left middle = 15
upper side = 64
prisoners = 5
all = 108

its only an estimate, there maybe a slight differnece, but white is leading, as for me the game should end like in a varation
white has got sente during the whole later yose (in my varation) and wins by more than 10 points]

(;W[kj];B[gk];W[fk];B[em];W[dm]C[perhaps I shouldn't have prevented the cut and instead   eliminate the eyespace he's trying to make.  But it's the first time I've seen anyone try to invade like this, so I wasn't sure what to do.

If he had extended into the middle from any number of places, I probably wouldn't have won.  I think I'm getting better at fuseki, which was my weakest part before.
