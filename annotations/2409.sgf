AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am Thorre. This is a 5 stone game against a friend with 4kyu-strengh.

Finally I lost this game, cause I failed right timing to close the last corner. But away from this there were lots of mistakes that I made. So it would be nice to hear / read your advice. Thanks a lot!

At some points you will find my questions. Perhaps it would help to look at these questions, cause you can check my wrong logic.

Thorre (KGS 10.Kyu)

Hello, I'm Tyrus (Thomas), playing as 2k in Germany and I'm your reviewer for today. ;) 
I marked my comments with a "T" so you should be are able to identify them.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[cf];B[fd];W[jc]C[Should I attack now or prepare a black whole board moyo?

T: Both is possible.];B[dj]C[I decide for san ren sei formation. Its a pincer too. Was it right?

T: This is ok I think.];W[jq];B[ce]C[Whites tenuki here is an invention to attack...

T: Good idea. I probably would play there too.];W[df];B[ci]
C[But how to attack the right way?

T: Looks a little odd. W is already overconcentrated, so you might take the initiative and attack another white stone.]
;W[fg];B[he]C[I want to split all white forces.

T: This kind of splitting seems like an overplay to me. W can live at the top easily after this. So prefer H17. Even if white connects, he will have not much points.]
;W[hc]
(;B[gc]C[Probably bad, I want to kill two birds with one stone - save the corner territory and the connection into center, but I failed. Are there better ways?

T: Yes, you can't expect to get all the areas you defined for sure. H13 instead does a better job, because if white mus run away for a while. This way you can enclose the left side maybe, even if w gets a part of the upper terretory.
Otherwise you could think about a move like G10 to close white in on the one hand and build a wall to the bottom left side on the oher hand.]
;W[hd]
(;B[gd]TR[ge]CR[gc][fd]C[T: This is the empty triangle, bad shape. The cut remains, because the ladder works for w.]
;W[ge];B[hb]LB[he:A]C[T: This move is small and rather pointless. It only gives white a base. It's more important to extend the A-stone.]
;W[ib]
(;B[fb]C[T: This is a really small endgame move. Don't cover this minor cut, the H15-stone is very more important.]
;W[hh]C[What is the strongest way to attack these 4 white stones at the top? Should I extend my cutting stone?

T: Yes. H14 threatens to catch the white cutting stone at A.
After that you can attack white's eye-shape at the top while running out with the 2-stone-group.]

(;B[ef]C[Splitting up white forces...

T: This is too agressive I think. You should not attach a group with several stones, becaue its you who becomes weak after that, even if a cut works.]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[gf]C[T: W plays rather defensive.];B[eg];W[dh]
C[T: Shouln't work.];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[cj]
(;B[dg]C[T: Wrong direction. See my variation.];W[ch];B[bi]
;W[dk];B[cg];W[bh];B[ej];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai]C[What about that result? Had I could do better?

T: The variation shows how it's possible to kill all of white stones.]
;B[ie]C[Are there better moves? Diagonal move?

T: If you find it necessary to rescue the stone this is a good move to reach that goal, bi]
;W[kd];B[jf];W[jh]
(;B[id]C[Destroying white shape...

T: K16 is far better, see my possible variation.];W[ic];B[lf]
;W[md];B[me];W[mc]
(;B[nf]C[Probably bad, but I feel uneasy with the move o17 to shut white in, cause I fear my center troops cutted of...

Yes, you should cover the cut sooner or later, but it's not so urgend, because the upper white stones aren't completely alive at this moment. So O17 is surely better.]
;W[ob];B[nc]C[T: white gets only stenghtened with this move. You shouldn't attack every weakness of the enemy immediately, because you lose other opporturnities in the later midgame this way.]
;W[nb];B[lh]C[Attacking whites center group.

Good strategy.];W[ki];B[pj]C[Bad, I think. I failed to block whites escape into the corner.

T: You shouldn't expect to gain much terretory in the upper right, because white has potential with P18 or R14 to the corner no matter what you do. But a more severe pincer around R12 sets white under more pressure.]
;W[rd]
(;B[mi]C[T. M10 looks normal.];W[kj];B[ii]C[T: This peep is not good here, white gets stronger, and you get weaker.]
;W[ih];B[jk];W[gj];B[ek];W[hk];B[gh]C[Hoping for cut whites troops, but failed. Are there better ways?

T: In only very little cases you can cut by attaching a strong group. In most cases your stone (group) will become weaker or does even die.]
;W[fh];B[hg];W[fi];B[gi];W[hi];B[gg];W[fj]C[T: As you can see white is connected solidly now and your stones in the middle are under a bit pressure.]
;B[hf];W[gn]
(;B[cm]C[T: D7 is better.];W[dl]
(;B[cp]C[Closing the corner to save territory. Too early?

T: This play overconcentrates your stones. Have a look at my variation.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[T: This is bad, white exactly gets what he wants, save terretory]
;W[fp];B[dm];W[el];B[er];W[np]
(;B[pn];W[ql]C[How to answer that move?

T: The attach from above is common or maybe R6.]
(;B[qm];W[pl]C[T: W is strenghtend.];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[qj]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[qi]C[T: This cannot work. Hane is too agressive here]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[qh]C[T: It's better to push from the other side.]
;W[pg];B[ol];W[ok];B[oj];W[om];B[nl];W[pm];B[on];W[nm];B[ml]
;W[kg]
(;B[kf]C[T: Not necessary, white can't cut your stones.];W[km]
;B[kh];W[ji];B[jg]C[T: Small endgame. What is with O3 or G2?]
;W[mn];B[qe];W[re]C[T:  Why not simply R17? but I think O3 is still much bigger.]
;B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[pe];B[og];W[qd];B[oh];W[pc];B[pf];W[qg]
C[I failed to close last corner.];B[qe]C[T: One-point-ko...]
;W[pq]C[How to answer that move?

T:This move had not been necessary... You failed to take initatiative. But see my later comments.]

(;B[oq]C[T: This is not so good.  W can cut your P3 stone of and gets more then should be allowed. But you have to fight now, so it might be ok in this case.]
;W[op];B[qq];W[pr];B[or]C[T: You cannot catch the white stones if white plays correctly. Fortunately to you he didn't. Look at my variation.]

(;W[qr];B[rp];W[po];B[qp];W[oo];B[rr];W[nr];B[ps];W[nq];B[qs]
C[T: This is a good result for you.];W[qo];B[ro];W[fr];B[fs]
;W[gs];B[es];W[gr];B[cl]C[T: B8 is better.];W[bk];B[fk];W[gk]
;B[fl];W[em];B[bl];W[fm];B[ak];W[ck];B[gl];W[hl];B[lm];W[ln]
;B[kl];W[jm]C[T: Quite good endgame.];B[ij];W[mm];B[ll];W[hj]

;W[od];B[ld];W[lc];B[le];W[ns]C[T: Big!];B[ga];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk]
;B[ia];W[ja];B[ha]C[T: Filling ko should be one of the last endgame moves. E4 for example is bigger.]

;W[lb];B[ep];W[fo];B[nn];W[no];B[if];W[ik];B[ne];W[oc];B[os]
;W[aj];B[al];W[lk]C[T: Recapitulating remarks: 

1. Don't play attach-moves if you want to attack a weak group! It only becomes stronger this way.

2. Try to read out carefully if an enemy move really is sente. I saw several points in this games when you lost initiative while white got crucial points.

3. Try to blay good shape-moves. Have a look at http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/shape_up . This is an interessting article about many  aspects of good shape and maybe it helps you to avoid empty triangles and similar moves next time. :)

I hope you are able to improve your skill a bit with my comments and suggestions. Regards,
