C[[Reviewer, please comment on my general style, such as playing too unsafely, heavily, or not playing big or urgent moves in proper sequence. This game is not typical of my playing style, however, since I tend to do better at large scale strategy and poorly at close tactics. I normally tend to make and let territory be made. Playing somewhat aggressively was more fun. Also point out any relatively obvious mistakes made by either side that were not converted. I've made some comments where something unexpected happened.\]
kk1 [13k\]: hi




I try to show you some mistakes in the beginning and some wrong direction of play. There are also some misread sequences. For this last kind of errors the only solution is to read better :)]
