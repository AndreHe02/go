C[This game was played on KGS on Nov 1th 2006.

I (bschmitt, white) have spend some effort on learning fundamentals as well as doing most of the "graduated go problems". Now I want to improve my opening skills, so I started reading Otake's "Opening..." book, here trying to take his advice into practice. There I encountered some problems. This is what most of my questions are about.

Finally, I could win the game by a rather large difference, but before, I felt some large dangers and I am not sure if my first moves were suitable. I would like to ask you the reviewer to concentrate on the Opening and beginning of mid-game. Thank you for this service in advance.

Reviews can be in English, German or Spanish.

*** Overall, I think the lower right region is where all of your problems in the game came from.  The weak right white group dominated a lot of your later plays.  By reversing that effect and putting black in danger (something that was possible), I think you'd be able to have a game that left you with the opposite feeling of this game.  There are a number of points in the game where moyos on the right and top could have been greatly effected and may be of interest.  i hope my comments are helpful.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[nd];W[ce]C[I know that the upper left enclosure usually tends to look at the upper edge, but I thought that black would still prefer the right edge.


*** I don't paricularly like this situation.  I feel like any white extension along the top will have reduced effectiveness because of black's presence.  I think I'd likely respond along the top (to spoild white's potential framework).  Then, if white does enter the right side, I could shove him around a bit.  The top extension may work well with chasing around or enclosing white.]
;B[pj];W[jc];B[ck]C[I think this prevented a w framework on the left...

*** I'd recommend checking black toward the top.  See variation]

(;W[jq]C[...but I felt content with another sphere of influence on the bottom.]

(;B[ch]C[This move didn't seem big to me, destroying black's miai, so I ignored it temporarily.

*** Yes, black chose the wrong direction to extend.  Playing toward thickness is a bad idea.]
;W[nq]C[to extent the bottom.];B[oq]C[I am generally not sure what to do with this response to the w lower approach.]

(;W[no]C[I tried this one not to play to heavily. Is this move ok?

*** Not really.  Given the fairly long extension from K3, and the even larger gap after that, I feel the bottom is overall rather weak.  There's a lot of potential attacks for black and that can only lead to bad things]
;B[pn]C[wondering why b didn't cut me at once,];W[nr]C[I wanted to stabilise my position. I think this move was to small/slow, but I didn't see a better one.]
;B[or]C[like this, I thought the lower right w wall was heavy enough and wanted to stabilise the left side of low edge/the low left corner.]

(;W[dn]C[*** Consider C6 here.  Black's 3rd line stones on the left can pressure this shape (forming a nice base for black if needed)]
;B[jo]C[I wanted to catch or hunt away this stone. I didnt succeed at all - that's why I asked for a review.

*** In many cases, I'd play H4 in response to an attack like this.]

(;W[nm]C[*** I think this move is very big, but not because it attacks K5.  Consider what would have happened if black had played there... White would start to fold in on itself and black would start building a very large framework on the right hand side.  Look at the variation showing an alternative move.  Black starts looking really impressive afterwards.]
;B[ol];W[lc];B[mc];W[kf];B[ld];W[kd]C[before, I wanted to enlargen the top territory/infl.]
;B[mp]C[My opponent frequently used efficient peeps I had not seen before...]
;W[np];B[lr];W[gq];B[lq];W[lm];B[hp]
(;W[kp]TR[ch][ck][mh][oh]C[Somehow I thought I could divide the black invasion, catching both.

** I think the idea is sound enough.  I think you later allowed this pair of stones to get cut (leading to trouble for you).  I'd also consider H3 as an alternative... leaving white rather stable and giving black a delicate floating shape in need of repair.  Note that simply chasing black may be enough.  the (black) areas marked with triangles are likely to get damaged by any kind of chase.  I did make a variation showing one alternative.]
;B[jp]C[*** Consider L3 here]
(;W[ko];B[kq];W[iq];B[kn];W[lo];B[mn];W[mo];B[ln];W[nn];B[jm]
;W[in];B[mm]
(;W[nl];B[jn];W[ml];B[ho];W[nj]C[mistake by me. I had not seen:

*** While the bottom turned out poorly, note that the chase (sadly of your group instead of black's) did lead to an effect on black's right side. What could have been a very large black area is starting to become an area for easy invasion/reduction.]
;B[hq]C[that here,];W[hr];B[gr]C[I would be cut.

I had not expected this. For 10 seconds, I thought of giving up.]
;W[fr];B[ir];W[jr]C[then I tried to catch the black M3 group, but I had counted the liberties wrong.]
;B[hs];W[kr];B[ls];W[mq];B[js];W[lp];B[ks];W[eq];B[bn]C[*** This attack is exactly why you should consider C6 instead of D6 earlier.]
;W[bp];B[co];W[do];B[cm]
(;W[el];B[ej];W[oh]C[the w right group still had to escape for another eye. I tried to do this in sente.

*** Even if the white group was secure, a play in this area is correct.  If you look at the territory potential on the board, this is a huge region for black.]
;B[qh];W[dg]TR[eh][fh][gh][hh][ih]C[to avoid another large invasion...

*** I feel this is a bit of an over play.  White looks too wide open.  I think that it's easy for black to trim the area a bit with a nice set of forcing moves.  the resulting center thickness may be enough for black to exchange enough top territory for middle territory to preserve a win in this game.  (That's based off a probably incorrect reliance on the score estimator feature of cgoban3)]

(;B[le];W[jf];B[pf];W[fh];B[id];W[ke]LB[je:A]C[I had learned a little and connected solidly and not at A not to leave to much aji.]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[di];W[cg]C[I think I was lucky around this corner and it could have come worse for white. Don't you think?]
;B[ci];W[lb];B[mb];W[lf]C[not to be cut from bottom group.

*** See variations of a different black response.  Black can do some reasonable reduction]

(;B[gg]C[*** See comments on variations];W[gh];B[ig];W[ji];B[hh]
C[Now a fight began and I still think I only won it by luck.
Couldn't black have lived/run away/caught anything?

*** By this point, I think black has already lost this fight.  They played too heavy trying to save all their stones and none will live.  I show one variation with a bit more resistance by black (following your response here)]
;W[hi]
(;B[kh];W[jh];B[jg];W[kg];B[lh];W[ih];B[hg];W[hc];B[fg];W[eh]
TR[gi]C[*** I'd consider protecting that cut instead of connecting directly.  A play at G10 may build toward a connection at the bottom]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[fi];W[ij];B[jj]C[interesting move.];W[ki];B[fd]
;W[he];B[hd];W[ie];B[ge];W[gc];B[gd];W[ee]C[destroying eyespace.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[fc];W[hb];B[jd];W[kb];B[dd];W[cd];B[de]C[*** See variation for some alternate follow up.  It may leave you feeling better about white's position.  Look carefully at what potential eyespace black can possibly have and you'll notice you can secure yourself a bit without much worry.]

(;W[ed];B[df];W[ec]C[Finally I had enough liberties. But I still don't lose the feeling that black could have won the fight somewhere around here.]

;B[bk];W[bh];B[bi];W[ag];B[aj];W[bq];B[dr]C[Endgame. There will be one mistake by black, responsible for the nice result for white.
