;B[qd]C[Hello and thanks for  taking the time to review my game.

I seem to have a weak playing style and I'd like to know how to improve it. In the beginning I tried to grab a lot of territory, but I ended up losing most of it. 
Mostly I'd like to know how to improve my defence and how to attack better.

Hi! my name is Jérémie and I am 15k on KGS. I'll try my best to answer your questions and offer you some variations for different situations. I tried to focus on the most important ones.]
;W[dp];B[jj]CR[dc][cd][dd][pp][qp][pq]C[This is a rather unusual move and it is probabibly not good. Normally the first moves are played in the corner. You do sometimes see people opening their game at the tengen (center point) but I wouldn't go for it until you get a lot better.

Better options would be one of the marked points.];W[dc];B[pq]
;W[ce];B[nc]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[I would prefer to play at A or B to prevent the white shimari to get the best extention.]
;W[oc]C[Wrong move for white];B[od]C[Good answer. Black can keep white in a tiny corner and get a lot of inluence.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[nb]
(;B[pb]C[This is probably not good. You should not try to kill white (it is not possible here) but try to get influence by letting it live small.]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[ob];B[qb];W[qc];B[rc]C[not good, white can still cause some trouble]

(;W[jc]
(;B[lc]C[Not a good move. You should always attack from far away. Contact moves are almost solely for defense purpose. White did not answer correctly, but this should not have worked.]

(;W[ld];B[mb]C[Well played. Threatening two groups with one stone is very good.]
;W[lb];B[md];W[ma]
(;B[qj];W[mc];B[le];W[kc];B[kd]LB[ke:A]C[Atari is always tempting, since it looks like the ultimate sente move. But it often is not a good move. You should only play atari when there is a very good reason to do so. Here A would be a lot better. (Not to mention the south-west corner has still not been approached).]
;W[lc];B[iq]LB[fp:B][fq:A]C[Better a A or B to force a white answer.]

C[This is not good I think. The white group has no hope of living on its own so the only thing to worry about is to ensure the black group marked will not get into trouble. That group has already one eye and can make another one so you should drive white to it. However this sequence includes a not-so-easy fight so you should be prepared for it.]

There sure is room for a lot of improvement but improvement will come fast ;-) I gess by the time you read this review you will already have improved a lot. I still hope it will be of some use.

I would suggest going to http://www.goproblems.com and solve as many problems as possible (play the 30k time trial and try go go as far as possible) over and over again. That helped me a lot. 

As far as attack and defense go, just remember attacking is from afar, never at contact. Defense however often implies contact play. That is because when you play in contact with an ennemy stone, you almost alwas reinforce the ennemy group which is not what you want to do if you are attacking but is something you will not care about is the group is already strong and you are reinforcing your position.

Also I would recommend not to play too much with people as strong as you. Especially in the 30k-20k range, you should spend as much time as possible playing 9-stone handicap games with stronger players. You will learn a lot from that.

If you have any further questions or comments feel free to email me or to contact me on KGS (http://kgs.kiseido.com), I go by the nick iPiou there.]
