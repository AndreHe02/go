;B[qp]C[Overall, this game I made a few live groups,
but wasn't able to make much territory with them. Usually, I get drawn into
little contact fights at the expense of making territory, while my opponent
makes large territory gains. I tried the opposite this game, but with limited
success.];W[dp];B[pc];W[dc];B[pj];W[nc]C[White attacks early, I respond by extending to Q15.]
;B[pe];W[pl];B[oq]TR[ce][cj]C[Instead of P3 for move 9, should I have played Q12 or Q13?
Making this wall would be more valuable if Q8 wasn't there.
The
problem with this play is that B is already concentrated on the right, and
W is everywhere else. This corner can be defended later if W attacks again.
Playing between the W stones on the left or top edges, would establish B's
presence and distribute influence.];W[qn];B[jp];W[gq];B[lc]
;W[ne];B[hc];W[jc];B[jb]LB[jd:A]C[This
sequence, I tried to make the larger territory grabing moves, but white had
me constantly on the defensive.
It is not worth taking territory below
the third line. The outside influence is worth more than the amount of territory,
which requires as many stones to seal, as if it were on the third or fourth
lines. So by that reasoning, B should play K16, letting W live, but small
and gain influence.];W[fb];B[gb];W[ga];B[hb];W[hd];B[ic];W[jd]
;B[kc];W[ia];B[ha];W[fa];B[lb];W[ka];B[ja]C[W should have assumed B lives and sealed it against the top edge, rather than trying to kill.]
;W[pg]LB[qg:A]C[Maybe I should have played under move 32 at R13?
The under move would be good now, because it can either connect with Q10 or extend top corner territory.]
;B[mj];W[ml];B[mn];W[qk];B[jj]LB[qj:A]C[Shouldn't ignore R9. W can join up with Q13 and take right side.]
;W[di];B[kl]TR[lk][lm]C[Last
two plays by B, K10 and L8 don't secure territory. Get corners and sides
first, running to centre to escape. Killing W will be difficult and overcontrate
B in one area.
However, if you wish to seal in W, M8 seems better, which closes two escape routes M7 and M9.]
;W[qj];B[nl]C[Overcontrating
plays in one area. Don't play to capture or kill unless threatened by capture
or death. Get in between W stones on left side on the third line 'C' before
W plays there.];W[nk];B[nm];W[ok];B[mk];W[oo];B[op]LB[np:A]

60-72, how could I have prevented white from making a live group in the corner.
Is that a standard sequence to invade inside an occupied corner?
With B stones already at P3,4 W should not live in the corner.]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[pp]LB[pq:A]C[Playing that at Q3 would've put more pressure on W, while B is still safe.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[rs]LB[sr:A]TR[rs]C[The
key to killing in the corner is often the 1-2 point at S1 or T2, since it
prevents the extra eye at T1.]
(;B[sq];W[sr]LB[ps:A]C[W already has
a living shape. For future reference, note that you can skip defending T3
since W doesn't gain a real eye by capturing it.]

;B[js]C[A
small move. B wasn't in any danger and W's loss of K2 doesn't pose a significant
further threat. W can ignore K1 and take big territory elsewhere.]
;W[ir];B[ks]C[If defending after being attacked is safe enough, play elsewhere, rather than defending prematurely.]
;W[io];B[kq]C[Way
too defensive. Even if you were to lose those three stones, playing elsewhere
now (e.g. left side) would be worth more.];W[pn]
(;B[ld]LB[le:A];W[gc];B[le];W[fd];B[lg];W[re]TR[of]C[P14
is very good for B (or O13 or W) as it pretty much determines the life/death
of O15,17.];B[rd];W[qd]LB[qe:A]
(;B[pd]C[Try to find a 'forcing move' which is delays need for defense, like the alternate shown.]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[rc];B[pb]C[This defensive move is not necessary, but good in that it allows connection below at O18.]
;W[ng];B[li]C[Not needed. Already pretty solid. Note that B still hasn't played on the left side of the board!]
;W[nb]C[There goes the chance to connect below.
Your
best area for improvement is in timing. Think about open areas you want to
play in, or urgent moves (like P14 or O18 were), and only defend W's advances
if the threat is bigger than the gain where you next which to play.]
;B[na];W[ma];B[mb];W[oa];B[la];W[jg];B[jh];W[ih];B[kh]C[This
appears to be overcontrated. Either way W attacks B's defenses hold. Perhaps
better to cross-cut at J13. Or of course, invade new territory on left side.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[ol];B[oi];W[qi];B[hm]C[OK,
finally, a play into new territory. Try not to play the entire game as a
single string of stones. Play near the corners and edges, and connect them
up along the sides to form territory, or toward the centre to escape and
connect with other living groups.];W[dm];B[fl];W[hk];B[hj];W[gj]

(;B[ij]LB[gk:A]C[The cross-cut at G9 may have been better, since atari of H10 either way does not pose immediate capture.]

didn't need to be played, since it doesn't really threaten W and N8 can be
captured later to connect the N group with rest.];W[fo];B[jk]

threats, but in this case there would be no more possible threats, since
playing 'A' makes two eyes.]

played by either B or W doesn't change the score. Play elsewhere like H11,

takes 1 from W.];W[ro];B[me];W[kg];B[hi];W[hh];B[gi];W[ad];B[qo]

- B lost all four corners
- B did not stake much claim on the sides
- B played much in the middle, where it takes more turns to secure the same territory as near edges
Your

play in, or urgent moves (like P14 or O18 were), and only defend W's advances
if the threat is bigger than the gain where you next which to play.
Don't play too much in one area (invade open area early between opponent's stones), or as a single continuous string.
Sometimes
you defend before a threat is upon you. If it is safe to defend after being
attacked, play elsewhere. It is good to solidify and not leave too many weaknesses,
but this is usually away from the edges for groups not yet connected to a
living one.])
