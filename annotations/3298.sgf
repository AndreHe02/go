;B[qd]C[Hi, I'm endgame on KGS and IGS.  In this game I played as black and lost by
 5.5.  I fought a ko from a "well thought out plan to fight ko for some extra 
points in the top left" i.e., "misclick", but I don't think it would have made
 a difference.  Comments on the fuseki would be helpful, because I rarely open
 on the 3-4 as black, but have been having a little luck with it lately.  I al
so have the feeling I lost the game around move 55 so any comments you have fo
r the middlegame would be good. Thanks for the review.

M:  Hi, I'm Munisai.  Do take all of my comments with a huge grain of salt; I'm only a few stones stronger.  I think you are correct; the game was largely lost in the fuseki.  Black gained back a lot on white's mistake (L6) but played catch up from there.]

C[M:  This is usually played at C14 or D14.  By playing the 5-4 point in resp
onse to a 3-4, you gave up some territory locally and committed to a more infl
uence-oriented game.  Playing this move closes the "open skirt" but allows whi
te to play D14 and nullify black's influence.  In exchange, black C17 becomes 
useful.];W[df];B[fd];W[od];B[oc]C[M:  Before playing this move, consider the joseki that can result.  P17 is 
a territorial move, and in exchange, white will build up influence toward the 
center and on top.  If white gets K17 or K16, black's wall at the top left wil
l no longer be a fair trade for the territory white obtained in the top left c
orner.  

M:  So, instead of P17, play a move that works well with the top left.  A pinc
er of some sort would work well (N16 or N17, M16, L16) and be an extension fro
m black's wall, too.];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc];B[je]C[M:  The cap is a moyo-reducing move.  If you are worried about F16 getting 
space for a base (or moving out to the center), H17 works better.  This move w
ill cause white to solidify his base.];W[id];B[le];W[ld];B[kd]
;W[lc];B[hc];W[kc];B[pi]TR[dp][pp]C[M:  This move is in the wrong area.  Both marked 4-4 stones want a large extension, so the area between them is contested.  In addition, Q11 is close to an already strong black position (in the top right), so it is an inefficient use of the stone.  Q9 or Q10 are possible, if you really want to play on the right side.]
;W[nq]C[M:  This is where black really wants the Q11 stone to be at Q9 or Q10.  The one space pincer (M3) would be a perfect response if Q11 were a little closer.]

(;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[qk]CR[df][dp][kq][nq][pr]TR[pi]
C[M:  The two triangled stones are working very inefficiently.  

M:  In contrast, look at the white stones.  They are spread all over the board and will make territory when black plays on the right side.  White has no white groups (M17 is quite stable) and has sente, so I think white has come out of the fuseki with a huge advantage.]
;W[cj];B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[M:  For white to place this way, the stone at L3 should be a little closer -- maybe at K3 or so.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jp]C[M:  J3 is probably better, in that it start to secure a base for black.]

(;W[kp];B[jo];W[ir];B[hp];W[kn]C[M:  M6 is more secure.];B[ko]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[mo];B[jm]C[M:  Great result for black.  White lost a lot with L6.  H4 is no longer floating.]
;W[fn]C[At this point white looks ahead to me.  I was eyeing D8 but w54 made that l
ook scary.  What now?  O14?  I think I lost the game here.

M:  Black isn't in such bad shape right now.  Both sides have half a board "under control."  Black has spent more stones on the right side, and as a consequence, it is more secure.  The left side has weaknesses around D8 and D12.  The top left corner has a weakness at C17/C14.  The bottom left corner can be reduced a little with C3.  

M:  The center is wide open, and black has a somewhat unstable group at F16.  If white attacks it, he could get a lot of central influence, so black needs to make a move on the top left to secure eyespace or move it into the center.  J18 seems okay (afterwards, G18 makes two eyes), as it threatens white's space.  F14 is also worth consideration.]
;B[em]C[M:  Two things about forcing moves (like this peep):  
1.  It is light -- be prepared to discard it while using it.  
2.  Don't play a forcing move unless you're sure it's good.  In this case, playing E7 removes the chance to play E5.  Which is better?]
;W[en];B[fm]C[M:  Too heavy.  Just pull away.  E10 seems good, but E10 was good without E7.  A move at the top left is still important, as white can force black there to build thickness toward the center.]
;W[gm]C[M:  I think white should just have taken territory with C8 or D8.  Black has to play another move to keep running.]
;B[ek]C[M:  Again, too heavy.  Jump out faster and sacrifice some stones.  White is making territory and building influence while chasing this group.]
;W[dl];B[gl]C[M:  White is in a bind here.  H7 is weak because G6 cuts.  G5 threatens to take a few stones on the bottom, but then black just connects with H7.]

(;W[hf]C[M:  White should have continued with R13.];B[ph]C[M:  Good!]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[ih]C[M:  White had a lot of other choices.  the center is pretty much dame points, so C17, E15, E14, F2, and R2 (for example) are all better plays.]
