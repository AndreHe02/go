Hello archimed!

You only asked a few questions, so it's hard for me to find interesting answers for you. I will try to point out the things you should work on.

Severe fighting took place on the board, which must be expected after the "great wall" opening. It seems you are obsessed with killing. You must learn to gain from attacks without killing. The first objective of a good attack is gaining influence or territory. If it turns out later, that your prey can be killed, even better.]
;B[jj];W[pd];B[jd];W[dd];B[jp];W[dp];B[ig];W[nc];B[qo]C[This is the first strange move in this game. If you play against the great wall opening, you MUST interupt it, before it is completed. Otherwise it will be much too strong.

Here you had the chance to complete it, but you went for the corner? You let a great opportunity slip through your fingers.

R5 is not consistent with the first 4 moves. Try to keep them connected with L7.]
;W[op];B[pq]C[This is a great move. It stops White from getting a base and takes a lot of territory in the same turn.]
;W[oq];B[pp];W[lp]
(;B[or]C[This helps your oponent building good shape. The corner is perfectly alive without P2. If you want to undercut the 3 stones and chase them, I would prefer L2.

But undercutting doesn't seem very good anyway. I would prefer the "hane on the head of 2 stones" like the proverb suggests. The hane at P5 force White into a pityful life, while you gain strength towards the right side. (see variation)]
;W[nr];B[pr]C[Terrible to end here in gote];W[oo]C[White gets the good point]
;B[mq];W[nq];B[lq];W[mp];B[kq]C[Well... You stole his base, but in gote. He must run out in the center. Now your objective is hunting him in a way you can gain from.]
;W[pm]C[Permitting this good point to White is bad. There isn't much development potential left on the rigth side for Black.]
;B[pf]C[a leaning attack seems to be a good idea here... but the Problem is that W need not answer, because there is no good follow up after Q14. He could simple jump to a point like Q10 and ensure life. You lose your target before exploiting it.]
;W[qf]C[You are lucky and he answers. If you can manage to end the sequence in sente, you can get a good result.]
;B[pe]C[Wrong direction. You still want to attack the P5 group. the only move is R13, to build a wall. After you exchanged territory (for White) against power (for Black) you can continue the chase. that way you gain nothing, you only force W to take territory.]
;W[qe];B[qd]C[Too Aggressive.];W[pc]
(;B[rd]C[This attack cannot succed. You should take your last chance here to take R13 (see variation)]
;W[qg];B[qb];W[qc];B[rc];W[pb];B[sb];W[qa];B[ra];W[rb]C[Very small life in ko. Even if you win the ko, White will get a good point in exchange elsewhere.]
;B[on]C[Good threat.];W[sa];B[pn]C[I wouldn't have ignored it as White. You lost your corner, but that's no problem, is was little anyway. now you are in a good position to attack.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mn]
(;B[mm]C[Wrong side to attack from. I say it again here, because it is important. DON'T try killing this group. Chase it to build strength in a direction you can use it later.

The R14 stones are already alive, so building influence in their direction doesn't do you any good. Attacking from the other side instead gives you strength towards the whole left side. You can fight there more severely afterwards. (see variation)]
;W[kn];B[lm];W[ln];B[pi];W[ri];B[rj]C[This is an overplay. A move at R9 will do the job much better.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[rk];B[rh];W[sj];B[qh];W[re];B[pk]C[Good, letting White live small again is perfect, your center looks good.]
;W[qk];B[rm]C[You're trying to kill again. Here it might be possible to kill White. But I wouldn't take this risk without reading all the variations out before. Sealing him at Q10 force him to live again small in goto. Humiliating for W.]
;W[pj]C[Of course white tries to flee. While doing this he destroys all your prospects in the center.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[oi];W[nj];B[mh]C[White seems trapped in the black net, great move.]
;W[pg];B[og]C[I would suggest a stronger connection here, O12 for example.]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[rl];B[sl];W[qn];B[om];W[nk];B[ql]C[Again you should play more solid. Solid play is the key if you want to capture. Here you don't leave cutting points, but you give White a big ko threat. Playing P8 is proper.]
;W[ni];B[nh]C[If you had played O12 instead of P13 before, O11 wouldn't be sente for White.]
;W[lk];B[kl];W[kk];B[jk];W[li];B[kh];W[lh];B[lg];W[ki]
(;B[mi]C[If you permit K11, white is out. so there is no need to play N11. K12 or K11 would make pretty shape and force white to live in gote. (see variation)]
;W[ji];B[mj];W[mk];B[ii];W[jh];B[kg];W[ih]C[White escaped.

Could Black seal White?

---

Yes, a few times. Playing more solid should do the trick. Here you end with many cutting points. Sealing him in and make him live small would be a much better option.]
;B[hj];W[hh];B[fc];W[cf];B[fq];W[cn];B[dq]C[This attaching joseki is usually for living. Your F3 stone is secure, so you should leave it and decide later, how to handle the white corner.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[eq];B[dr];W[ep];B[cp]
(;W[bq]C[B3 is a terrible mistake for White. (see variation)]
;B[bp];W[er];B[br];W[ck]C[White should connect his lose group with the shape move at E6.]
;B[ch];W[dc];B[mc]C[M17 would secure a bigger piece of territory.]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kc];W[ne];B[mf];W[kb];B[jb];W[fg];B[bn]
;W[bm];B[co];W[dn];B[do];W[en];B[eo]C[this cut is a every good idea indeed, but your L3 stone is too weak to support it fully. A result from the mistake at N7 at the beginning.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gq];B[iq];W[go];B[fn];W[in];B[dl];W[cl];B[em]
;W[cm];B[bj]TR[ch][bj]C[Another killing attempt. but the marked stones are very weak. You should strengthen them before you think about attacking.

You must also consider that your L3 group is pretty dead without suport.]
;W[bk];B[cj];W[dk];B[ek];W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[fi]TR[ei]C[Terrible cutting point. This is very bad aji for later.]
;W[fk];B[el];W[ei];B[eh];W[fj];B[fh]C[You are permitted to secure the cutting point, but your stones are still far from being secure.]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[hl];B[il];W[hm];B[hp];W[gn];B[fm];W[gp];B[mr]
;W[jm];B[hg]C[H13 doesn't do much. Connecting the cut at K8 seems much bigger. Or saving the D11 group.]
;W[hi];B[pl]LB[po:A]C[There is no reason for that. If he saves his 3 stones, you can still connect at A. Instead of this small capture you should save your D11 Group.]
;W[jl]C[What happened?
---

You lost your K10 group, that happened.];B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[ef]
;B[ae];W[bd];B[gf]C[G14 is horrible. your group isn't alive. You must play B11 right away, or White will kill it.]
;W[me];B[le];W[jg];B[jf];W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[kr];W[dg]C[It's not too late yet, B11 saves most of the group. (see variations)]

C[Black died
When did Black die?

Black resigned here

---

Black died after D12.



Your main problem at the moment is attacking. You think a successful attack ends with a kill. But that's seldom the real goal of an attack.
I tried to explain how to use an attack efficiently. A good reading suggestion I can give you is "attack and defense" from Davids. The principles of attacking are made very clear in this book.

If you can overcome your bloodlust, you surely will improve sooner than later. I hope you can gain from this review and apply my advices in your games.

Keep enjoying this great game,
Bommel])
