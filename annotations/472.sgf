C[I can see several small misstakes I did, but I can not see the big ones. Most times I lose a game I can see what went wrong, where I could have played better. I cannot see that in this game.]

youre right to respond by comming out at e6];B[en]C[Maybe a reducing move around G4 and treating C6 lightly?

C[mtthomas> for the most part you're sense of direction was good but there were several tactical mistakes that cost the game. You could have made up the difference, or at least most of it, with a better engame as well. Sente is really important in the endgame and can easily make a 10 point difference in the game.

The only other comment i would have is that its ok to ignore moves every once in a while and give your opponent a couple useless stones. There were 2 times during the game I would have given up the o9 stones.]
