C[Despite the errors in the opening and middle game, Black was
still leading but lost in the endgame.

If you are going to play hoshi stones, you have to play bolder
and more large scale.  Hoshi stones are for influence and you'll
have to make territory indirectly (for example by attacking).

Another thing I've noticed is you make unnecessary forcing moves
(B37, B57) which are wasteful and give up ko threats.  Do not
play such moves unless you absolutely have to.];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[nq]LB[qn:A][cn:A]C[Unusual move for an even game.  It's not my style and I don't
like it.  The A points are usual and work well with W's hoshi
stones.];B[oq]LB[pn:A][qn:B]TR[pd]C[I don't like this move.  I prefer A or B which reduces the influence
of W's hoshi stone.  You are also inducing W to strengthen his
stone within your area.  This move seems better suited in a handicap
game.];W[np];B[pn];W[kq];B[jq]C[Is this OK for black, or should I be more aggressive?

This is OK since W did not play at M3.];W[kp];B[ko];W[lo];B[kn]

(;B[dj]LB[km:A]C[I realize the rush to get this big point but a W move at A puts
a cramp in your moyo.  See vars.];W[cn];B[cp]C[Is this move OK?

Yes];W[ck];B[cj]TR[ck][cn]C[Not aggressive enough?

Looks OK.  W's stones are weak.];W[dk];B[cg]C[Why not C14?  Or hane at E9?  B23 is not very bold or productive.]

B.];W[ej]

to back you up in a fight.  See variations.];W[fi]
(;B[fj]C[E12 seemed too passive, but this didn't work out very well so
was E12 better?

B29 is bad - the cut at E9 is the move to play.  You have to
keep W's stones separated!];W[ek]C[W's group is getting strong.]
;B[fh]C[Maybe I could still play E12 here?

B31 is bad, E12 would be better.];W[di];B[dh]C[??];W[ci]TR[ei]
C[????

W should just capture the marked stone - it is unlikely for B
to get a good result after the capture.];B[gi]TR[dd][gc][pd]
C[This ponnuki is not worth so much considering W's marked stones.
But at least this group is strong.];W[bj]C[Wasted move, equivalent to passing]
;B[ee]TR[qf][nc][cg][dh][fh][ei][fj][gi]C[Another wasted move which is almost a pass.  W has just given
you a free move and there are much bigger points on the board
(such as the marked points).  Your marked group not in danger.
B37 is a thank-you move for W.];W[ed]C[W is thankful.];B[fe]
C[Another bad move - way too slow];W[jd]C[The right side is bigger]
;B[qf]C[Good];W[ce]C[Bad.  At least play o17 or pincer.];B[nc]
C[Was this a reasonable response to white ignoring R14?

Very much so.];W[qe]C[Thank-you move for B.];B[pf]C[*Thanks*]
;W[oc];B[nd]C[Thanks again];W[qc];B[pi]C[??  You should be extended at least three spaces.]

[lo][ln]C[This didn't seem like the right move.  What would be better?

Too direct, no need to attach.  The best would be to somehow
engineer a double attack on W's marked stones as his lower group
is not fully safe yet.  Perhaps A, B, C, or D would be a place
to start but the variations are plentiful and difficult to work
out.

Or more simply and better would be R7];W[rl];B[qm];W[ok]
(;B[qj]LB[nm:A][rk:B]C[Bad move.  Either split them up at A or cut at B.

W - 67 + 2 + 6.5 = 75.5 points
B - 63 + 1 = 64 points

At this point W has the better position and B profit somehow
by attacking W's marked group and take most of the bigger endgame
points (which is always easier said than done).]
(;B[lh]LB[mi:A]C[Cut at A!! See var.];W[mi];B[lg];W[kj]
(;B[hc]C[Should I have instead kept up the pressure on white's center
right group?

Yes.  B85 is too direct.  It is better to harass that group and
try to have the fight spill into W's territory and destroy it.

See var.

The rest of the game goes back and forth because of tactical
mistakes by both sides.  I've made a few more comments throughout
the game and I think you can answer most of your (tactical) questions
by playing through what will happen so you can see for yourself.
My style of reviewing is to point out strategic concepts and
mistakes, rather than going through tactics, unless I see moves/tesujis
which a player may have missed.];W[hd];B[gd];W[fc];B[id];W[he]
