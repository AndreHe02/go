;B[pp]LB[qr:A][qp:B]C[Az: This is a strange move, I would consider it a trick move since if W answers correctly the result is distinctly underwhelming for black. 'a' or 'b' would be more normal]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[oo];W[pn];B[qn];W[or];B[om];W[op];B[pm]
C[Az: This is at best a mediocre outcome for black. W's mistake is that he captured next when he should have tenuki'd. If W tenukis then the result favors him, since although black has some thickness W has a rock solid corner with profit in sente]
;W[oq]C[bad outcome for b?

Az: Distinctly better now that W answered, but this is still good for white in my opinion.]
;B[cn];W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[dm]
(;B[dn]TR[pn][po][op][oq][or]LB[do:A][ep:B]C[Az: Pushing and cutting is not inherently unreasonable, but W has a lot of stones on the right that make this dubious. I would suggest 'a' since W has a serious defect in his shape at 'b' afterward, see var]
;W[en];B[em];W[dk];B[fm];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[bn];W[go];B[dr]
;W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[Az: Blacks play locally has been good, but the two stones are difficult to move now.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[jc];W[qf]C[i wasnt sure what to do
r15 looks bad for me

Az: R15 would be terrible, since now only does it allow W to extend along the right, but your own stones there aren't 100% alive. The pincer was natural.]
;B[qh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[le]C[looks like a bad move so i decided to play g15 to isolate

Az: This feels vague, G15 seems reasonable.];B[ge];W[ff];B[ed]
LB[lg:A]C[Az: Huh? This is severe aji-keishi (a move that kills aji). Later you have probes around 'a' that you can use which this moves. Don't push like this unless you intend to cut (which wouldn't work). This would be best unplayed and move straight to 'a']
;W[df];B[pb];W[qb];B[qa]LB[lg:A]C[Az: Too early! W can tenuki after S19 and live since you don't have S12 yet. Better to attack with something like 'a', since although it would be great if W answered and you got this in sente, that's hoping for too much]
;W[lc];B[qe];W[re];B[rb];W[rh];B[ri];W[qi]LB[rc:A][sc:B][rd:C]
;B[qg];W[rj];B[rg];W[si];B[sg];W[ph];B[pg]C[Az: W's play here was weird, the result is good for B]
;W[sh]C[Az: So slow!!];B[qk];W[ni];B[oi]C[good result?

Az: Yes, W is in very deep trouble];W[pj]
(;B[pi]C[Az: This is a mistake, black can be much more severe...]
;W[oj];B[oh];W[qj];B[nk];W[rk];B[nj];W[mi]C[Az: W got off too easily, the result is not great for black since the lower group is thin]
;B[lg];W[je];B[rl];W[sk];B[db]LB[kc:A]C[Az: Doesn't make sense, B should be attacking W. If you want to defend your group while putting a little pressure on W you could try 'a']
;W[cb];B[eb];W[ic];B[id];W[jd];B[hc];W[kc];B[ib];W[kg];B[on]
TR[oj][pj][qj][qi][rj][rk][sk][si][sh][rh]LB[pp:A]C[its gote but it looks important

Az: If you're going to play here play 'a' first. This is important, but only because black made a mistake in his attack on the W group that left him thin.]
;W[jq];B[hn]LB[jo:A][kh:B][jg:C][hg:D]C[Az: This doesn't make sense, the two stones aren't serving an important purpose any more, so why try to save them so bluntly? Something like 'a' seems more reasonable.

I would prefere to try to reduce the center by pressuring W on top with B 'b', W 'c', B 'd']
;W[ho];B[in]LB[jn:A]C[Az: Heavy, jump to 'a' instead];W[jo]
;B[bk]LB[km:A]C[Az: B has more urgent matters like preventing W 'a' by playing there himself.]
;W[ck];B[al];W[bj];B[cl];W[dl];B[lh];W[ig];B[gf];W[gg];B[fg]
;W[de]C[here f13 probably overplay
c15 fixed the aji];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[lf]C[Az: This is a timid move by W that lets B do a huge amount of damage to the left]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[ej]LB[ci:A]
C[Az: Good squeeze by B, W 'a' is correct now];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh]
;B[cj]C[Az: B gets an early Christmas ;) W would have avoided this, he has only himself to blame. The game is now close]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[fn];B[fl];W[gl];B[gk];W[hi];B[ih]LB[lo:A][li:B]
C[Az: I think B is a little uncertain what his goal is here. Are you trying to kill the W group up top (that's not going to happen), are you trying to take the isolated 2 stones (fairly small on their own), ... ? It seems like B is attacking for the sake of it, but I don't see a clear purpose. I would take the first chance to tenuki and play a big yose move like 'a'. If you are worried about the safety of your lower group just play 'b'.]

;W[lk]C[i made a mistake which lead to this?];B[jk];W[jj];B[ik]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[nd];B[oe]LB[lo:A]C[Az: Small and unncessary, you have enough liberties you do not have to fear W pushing through. 'a' instead]
;W[ne]C[Az: W can live w/o this, so I don't understand his thinking]
;B[if];W[jg];B[rp];W[nb];B[es];W[fr];B[io]C[Az: Not good, this reduces a liberties when you're already a little short on them for 1 pt. Play this later in the endgame.]
;W[ip];B[fs];W[gs];B[ds];W[gq];B[kp]LB[lo:A]C[Az: Overplay because B lost a liberty, a more moderate move around 'a' is ok]
;W[jn]TR[io][ip]C[Az: If W played here first, would you exchange the two stones now?]
;B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[lo]C[Az: Ouch];B[ko]C[Az: Overplay, the stone is lost, don't make it worse]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[lp];B[rq];W[mm]C[big loss];B[ll]
C[Az: Doesn't make sense, this just compounds the loss];W[kl]
;B[ml];W[nl];B[ok];W[mk];B[ca]C[Az: Much better, B needs some big moves to stay in the game after the debacle in the middle]

[aa]C[I think  i missed a lot of moves here
thank you

Az: All in all not bad. I think the biggest mistakes of the game for B were in the attack on the T10 group and the failed reduction around L4. Black was saved by his endgame, if W had played a better yose he should have won. If you have any further questions feel free to stick them in the sgf and send it back.]

;W[ep];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[Az: W's shape is ugly and you have sente to reduce or take a bit point elsewhere. I think this is better than pushing and cutting when W is well positioned for a fight]
