C[what to do?

Walk with white along the edge, building a wall, and be happy.]
;B[hd];W[ic]TR[id]
(;B[jd]C[I think it's one step too early to jump, white will still walk you, but now the defect in your wall is pretty glaring.]

(;W[kb]C[White could have been more agressive; this is giving away a perfect wall for you; even just connecting at F18 would be preferable here.]
;B[kc];W[lb];B[lc];W[mb];B[mc];W[fb]C[nice result for me, or not?

Very, but because of the opponents mistakes.];B[co];W[ep];B[dk]
;W[hq];B[pj]C[any comments?

I like to play like this, but you have to remember to use the influence you are building. You can't think of a central moyo and putting all your eggs in one basket.]
;W[pn]TR[np]C[hm...and now? ^^'

Be happy white is giving you something to chase, for free.]

(;B[nq]C[This is too low when white has played high. If you absolutely want to stake out territory, N3 or even just R4 is better.]
;W[ql];B[qn]C[Too close, chase white, don't try to kill her.]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[ol]C[Good shape for white.];B[nj]C[Nice move, white should be worried here.]
;W[rj]C[Mistake];B[ri]C[Wrong focus; you don't want to kill white, you want to chase her, and build your own territory. Even a slow move in the center like M10 or L10 would be better. The edge is endgame.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[mg]TR[pi]C[It's entirely obvious what white is doing here. Protect the cutting point, and whites stone is stranded.]

(;B[ml]C[tenuki ok? I wanted to attack the weak group...];W[kg]
TR[nm][nn]C[This is bad form for white; she has nowhere to run to, and can't hope to build a living group in the center without losing out bigtime.]

(;B[om]C[This is much too close. White does not have an eye here anyway, so simply close her off from the center.]

(;W[pm]C[White has no reason to protect the one stone, when she does not gain an eye anyway.]
;B[nm]C[Look at the situation if you remove P7 and Q7; would you really make that exchange?]

(;W[pf]TR[ph]
(;B[qd]C[Again you fail to protect your cutting point, even when you are on the verge of killing white. Play super solid when killing!]
;W[rf];B[rk]C[this does nothing, focus on how white would save the group; she has at most one eye on the edge, and will have to cut you.]

(;B[pk]C[You know that white will answer at S6. If you play at S6, you know white will answer at Q9. Ergo, white is very much alive, and you should not waste valid ko threats. When you want to make a move on the group to threaten it, S6 is a better move, as it threatens just as much, but gains points at the same time.]

;B[fj]C[two weak groups to attack; but unfortunately it didn't work so well.. :\]

When attacking, have a goal. At this point, a goal could very well be to kill one of the groups, if so, play to secure any weaknesses first of all; you can always press the groups towards eachother and then split when you are solid.

Another goal could simply be to secure the left group, which is looking kind of thin here. You are well in the lead if you just secure everything.]

;W[ij];B[km];W[mi];B[mh];W[ng]TR[mj]
(;B[nk]C[unneccessary?

No, you need to protect here, to have any chance of harming the white middle group (you lose O11 or N12 if not)]
;W[ji];B[ki];W[ih]TR[fp]
(;B[iq]C[just experiments ^^'  where to play better, or how to do the best out of this situation?

The vital point here is F4, which would cut white to shreds.]

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 12k)

You miss moves on the edge a lot, and you do not seem to have any long range plans. When you attack weak groups, at least have a rudimentary plan for how to profit from it (and never expect profit from a kill), and make a new plan if it doesn't work out. It would probably be good to count more as well, to know if you are in the lead and can play safe, or have to push harder.


It must be said that it is a while since I played go very actively, and some of my advice might be wrong. If you see anything obvious, know that I probably just missed a variant, and that I haven't seen anything deep you missed. Anything I think was non-trivial, I have played out.
