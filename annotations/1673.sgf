RE[W+10.50]

C[mystic: Thanks for reviewing my game.  Any comment is very much appreciated.  Arigato Gonzaimasu!
Tilo: Hi mystic, let me give a general comment at the beginning. 
Your comments show that you really try to play as efficiently as possible - that's good, go on like this! 
However, your playing style is very aggressive. Compare moves 6, 10, 12, 14, 34, 84, 94. This didn't do too much harm to you because your opponent played very timidly, as you remarked yourself. He could have led you in much more trouble.
So, I'd suggest that you try to play more solidly. Remember that the best base for an attack is a strong position of your own! So, solid moves can be very efficient moves.
I wish you much fun with go in the future!];B[cp]C[khankin [18k\]: hi
mystic [17k?\]: hi];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[eq];W[mp]TR[cp][eq]
LB[cj:A][jp:B]C[Tilo: The marked black enclosure tends to a development on the left side rather than to the bottom, so here you might play around A. Your move has the disadvantage of entering an area where black is strong. An attack at B would do fine for black.]
;B[cf];W[di]LB[di:8][mp:6]C[mystic: Just like w 6, I play w 8 to avoid giving my opponent any moyo is key to mid-game development.  Is that right?
Tilo: In general, it is not obligatory to hinder an opponent moyo but if you don't like moyos, there is no problem to play like this - a question of style.
There is no rule "Don't let your opponent get a moyo" but there is one "Don't let your opponent perfectionate his moyo" - you only have to invade before it's no longer possible.
Here, Black around A would form a very good position so 8 is probably a good move. Only, B could perhaps take profit in attacking this stone because he is strong here.]
;B[bh]LB[ef:A]C[Tilo: Very bad. Black *must* separate White around A. White should now try to link up.]

(;W[ce]LB[ce:10][df:C][di:8][dl:D][ef:B][fd:A]C[mystic: I was thinking that A was more "standard" than w 10, but I felt I needed to apply pressure on the 2 black stones in order to "support" my w 8 stone.
Tilo: The most important here is to link up your stones or at least to threaten it at B - see the variation. 
10 is bad - it induces Black C (which luckily B didn't play). This weakens 8. Attaching strengthens both sides - that's the opposite of what you wanted.
And 10 is on the wrong side. It would be more important to add a stone to 8 - e.g. at D, to avoid being pincered.]
;B[cj]LB[df:A]C[Tilo: Weakhearted. Should be at A. Like this, it turns good for W.]

(;W[cg]LB[df:A]C[Tilo: An interesting tesuji but the normal move at A is really good enough - see var. B can make difficulties with an response at A.]

(;B[bf];W[bg]LB[df:A]C[Tilo: Risky. Still, A would be better.]
;B[ag];W[df]
(;B[ch]LB[ch:17][dg:A]C[mystic: I was so afraid b 17 would played at A instead.  I could be in deep trouble.
Tilo: No trouble at all - see var.];W[dg];B[be];W[bd];B[dh]
;W[af];B[ah]LB[bg:A]C[Tilo: This result is a little doubtful for W because a b moyo starts to rise on the left. This is the failure of (mainly) W A.]
;W[iq]C[Tilo: Good - it strengthens the weak stone and prevents B from extending his moyo.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[nr];W[qn];B[qo];W[op]LB[pn:A]C[Tilo: The normal continuation is A.]
;B[oq];W[oo]LB[qn:A]C[Tilo: The last two stones are gote and don't apport too much. A is weak now.]
;B[qf];W[qh]TR[pd]LB[nd:B][pi:A]C[mystic: It took me awhile to play this move.  As b runs toward center, he can attack either my lone stone Q16 or my other lone stone R12.  However, I was hoping I can run out faster than he does.
Tilo: If you want to pincer, you should do it further away from Black - e.g. at A. A counter-pincer would then be less efficient, and it combines nicely with the influence you have at the bottom to form a moyo.
But a move at B, reinforcing the w moyo at the top, is also possible.]
;B[of];W[nd];B[qj]LB[qh:34][qj:37]C[mystic: b 37 is what I worried about when playing w 34 tone. But...]
;W[oh]SQ[qj]TR[of][qf]LB[oh:38][qn:A]C[mystic: ... I was thinking that w 38 serves to attack both the 2 b stones (P14, R14) and the lone stone R10.
Tilo: Right, but the problem is a) the weakness of A and b) that Black can link up his groups (see later on).]
;B[oj];W[mh];B[mf];W[lj]TR[oj][qj]LB[lj:42]C[mystic: So here, I decided to "take profit" and go for the 2 / stones below.
Tilo: The problem is that they can still link up (see var.). This is the problem of the one-space low pincer.]

(;B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[Tilo: Now, the weakness of A becomes clear.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[po];B[qp];W[pm];B[ro]C[Tilo: Bad kikashi - the fight is now more important than the size of the corner.]
;W[sn];B[pl];W[sl];B[ql];W[sm];B[om];W[rk];B[rj];W[pn]LB[on:A]
[pn:58]C[mystic: I feel that if I don't fill in w 58, he won't let me take it back in ko.  Otherwise, A maybe a stronger move.  comment?
Tilo: 58 is totally right - A would not be of much use, and a ko very dangerous.]
;B[nm];W[mn];B[nn];W[lm]C[Tilo: Good - there's no need to defend.]
;B[mm];W[lo];B[rh];W[rg];B[qi]LB[qg:A]C[Tilo: B could link up with A (try it out yourself!).]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[si];B[sj];W[sh]LB[sg:A][sh:72]C[mystic: w 72 was a difficult move too.  The alternative move was at A.  Later on, when I failed to capture the targetted black group, I can't shake the feeling that w 72 instead of A was the reason for the failure.  comment?
Tilo: This doesn't make much difference. See the comments later on.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[ll];W[kl];B[ml];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[nk];W[ol]
;B[pi]C[Tilo: B threatens to cut through.]
(;W[qk]LB[pg:A]C[Tilo: Here is your mistake: you attacked too hard. Don't fix yourself on killing your opponent - rather try to get some profit on the outside while attacking.
You should have connected at A - threatening to capture a part of the upper group if Black saves his lower one. See var.]

(;B[pk];W[oi]
(;B[sf]LB[og:C][sf:87][sg:B][sh:72]C[mystic: b 87 probed my weakness at B.  Had w 72 been at B instead, I would've been able to defend at C instead.  Or maybe I was dead anyway.  Comment?
Tilo: See var.];W[sg];B[ph];W[pg];B[og]C[mystic: At this point, I lost the fight.  I got almost nothing out of this, as my center wall is too thin to be effective for future development.
Tilo: Right. You should learn from this that it's very hard to kill a group - so rather than being fixed on killing it, it's better to gain something on the outside while attacking.]
;W[jd]LB[ld:A]C[Tilo: A would be the normal move. You];B[dj]
LB[dm:C][ek:B][hp:A]C[Tilo: This is really too small. Best is probably A. Other possibilities are B and the very solid C.]
;W[dm]LB[dm:94][fm:A]C[mystic: w 94 was scary for me.  This is either an invasion for me or a target for b since my center wall is very thin.  Had b's next move been attacking my thin wall first, my 94 would immediately become a sitting duck.
Tilo: It's true that you have to invade but if B caps at A, you are in trouble. Perhaps it would have been best to play one to the right of 94. B secures the edge, then you expand your moyo on the top. This would give B some territory but you can't get all! Go is a game of exchange.
So the problem with 94 is that it is too deep, rather than the thinness of your wall.]
;B[bm]C[mystic: Luckily for me, b defended instead.
Tilo: This is a small move.];W[cn]TR[dm]LB[cn:96]C[mystic: With w 96, I was pushing my luck.  b can still turn to my thin wall first, and then attack my 2 / stones.]

[bo:0][bp:1][br:5][ck:8][cl:6][cn:96][co:98][dm:94][dp:99]C[mystic: Up to this point, I felt that b's sequence from b 95 to b 109 was too timid.  I consider this sequence to have cost b the game.  Comments?
Tilo: B lost much here indeed - your stones are strengthened while he got only minimal territory.]
;W[eo];B[ei]LB[hc:B][jf:A]C[Tilo: Again too small. The white stone isn't important, and B can't get much territory here. He should have reduced or invaded your moyo on the top - e.g. at A or B.]
;W[fh]LB[jf:B][jm:A]C[mystic: Isn't there a proverb that says, "do not peep where it cannot be cut?"  I think this was a bad move.  Comment?
Tilo: The proverb says, "do not peep where you can cut" - that is, do not lightly waste a cutting possibility. A b move at A would be bad, for example.
Your move is no peep but an expansion of your moyo. It would be more effective around B - there's it's real weakness.]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[eg];W[ef];B[fi];W[hh]C[Tilo: With the last three moves, B "forced" you to secure your moyo without gaining much.]
;B[ek];W[el]LB[fl:A][fm:B]C[khankin [18k\]: bathroom break
Tilo: This is not the time for a contact play. A or B are better.]

[fh][hh][lj][lk][mh][ni][nj][oh][oi]LB[ff:B][jm:26][kk:C][km:A]
[li:D]C[mystic: Come to think of it, even with w 126 covering the defect at A, I still have major defects at B, C, D that could've cost me the game.  My center / stones could've been targets.
Tilo: A b cut at B would be unreasonable because you are strong there. But Black could perhaps exploit it to help invading. C and D are not really dangerous because you have the option to link up to two sides - at least if you are ready to give up some stones.]
;B[hm];W[hn];B[ld]LB[ld:29]C[mystic: i wasn't afraid of b 129.  In fact, I was expecting it.
Tilo: Nonetheless, it is a very big point.];W[pe];B[pf];W[rd]
;B[sd]C[Tilo: ???];W[sc]
(;B[md]LB[hc:A][kf:B]C[Tilo: Now B could have tried the invasion at A. The outcome is not sure, but he should have a good chance to live.
Another possibility would be B, to secure the connection of his stone while threatening your moyo. See var.]
;W[kc]C[Tilo: Good to protect against the moyo invasion.];B[nc]
LB[md:35][nc:37][oc:A][qc:B][sd:33]C[mystic: b's 133, 135, 137 seem timid to me again.  I think I had bad aji at A and B that b never exploited.
Tilo: Yes, but the fight would have been difficult and the outcome not very clear. Black chooses the easy way.]
;W[oc];B[ne];W[nb];B[mc]C[Tilo: B might have tried harder to separate W. Several possibilities.]

C[mystic: Did w come out better in this sequence of exchange?  I thought b could've done a lot more harm.
Tilo: Yes.];B[mi];W[lh]C[Tilo: It's the right decision to discard the stones.]
;B[nh];W[kf]LB[kf:48]C[mystic: With w 148, I felt my victory was secured.

;W[mr]TR[kr][ks][lr][ls]LB[mr:64]C[mystic: w 164 was a gift.  Before this stone, I did not expect to get the 4 / points because of the open skirt.
Tilo: I don't know whether it's a gift - B gained much in gote with the last moves. Btw, 64 is worth much more than 4 points.]
;B[is];W[jr];B[so];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[pr];W[ep]LB[ij:A]C[Tilo: This is probably not sente, and small. Around A is worth more.]

[gk:88][hj:B]C[mystic: I felt the peep with w 188 was another mistake.  Again, I'm peeping where it cannot be cut.  With this move, my / group lost an extra liberty, which I needed a few moves later.
Tilo: Yes, B is better. But not because of the peeping rule but because of shortage of liberties. That's what is important now.]
