AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jd][pj][dj][jp][jj]C[
I am a beginning player. I have played many games on smaller boards, and can
do life and death problems in books at about a 15 kyu level. This was my
first game on a full-sized 19x19 board. I played black with a nine-stone
handicap game against a much stronger player. Of coures I lost, but it was
not such a blowout as to be embarrassing. Therefore, I'd be thrilled to have
the game reviewed. Perhaps you can recommend some direction for my
studies to take?

Thanks so much,

Eric];W[qn]C[Hi,  I'm richard hitier playing 10 kyu,
hope my review will please you.

I'll try to comment your moves the best way I can, but never forget I'm not that strong:
my advices could be wrong ;)];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[ql]
(;B[pl]LB[qk:A]C[well,
the first moves where good,
but here you should play A instead (look at variation)];W[pg]
;B[qf]LB[nd:A]C[I would like to say: to aggressive;
this looks like a defensive move.
'A' seems better to me (but I'm a kind of scary guy ;)];W[fd]
;B[gd]LB[df:A][jc:B][jf:C]C[same comment:
you play close for defense, when your weak

The academical move is A, but if you want to protect your middle edge stone,
consider playing B or C];W[gc];B[ge];W[fe];B[ef]C[to close, to weak: D14]

C[unusfull: your edge is still opened: what intended you to do ?
protecting your hoshi stone doesn't look necessary.
I would protect my territory: A];W[gp]C[yep, white is obliged to play there:
black's influence is to wide here ;)
sorry ... how do you feel ?
I always begin to panick in those case:
lets hope to get stronger enough to be able to defend our rights some day ;)]
;B[hq]C[I like this answer.];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[I don't know ... It's always a pain to know what side to chose.
Here, I would say that black is now over concentrated.
Of course, this seems to weaken the edge white stone (G13) ...But what does really gains black?
Look at variation to see if getting more influence isn't worth  ?]
