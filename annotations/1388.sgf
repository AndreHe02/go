C[I played white. We were about the same strength. I lost with a few points. Please find my general weaknesses, so I know what to practice, joseki, fuseki, yose, score calculation or life and death. I have mad a few comments along the game, especially where I didn't know what to do and paused to think for a couple of minutes. Thanks in advance.


Commented by Jarkko Lindblad (JL)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]C[mans [8k?\]: hi
rockston [8k\]: hi];W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb]
LB[eb:a][jc:b]C[JL: the usual move here for white is [a\] as it allows white easily to take sente (very valuable this early in the game) while still giving white a comfortable position. The move white played leaves white a bit thin and it is best for him to make his group stronger and play [b\] or something like that.]
;B[ci];W[po]LB[jc:a]C[JL: I guess this move is possible, but certainly white must first play at [a\].
Now black can play the variation at any time.]
(;B[qo]LB[pk:a]C[JL: I would have played hasami of somekind instead, probably [a\], in order to begin forming a moyo around the top right corner.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[ql]N[Interesting move]C[JL: A novel move designed to form a moyo around the top right corner.]
;W[rn]SL[ql]LB[rm:a]N[Wrong shape]C[JL: The proper shape is [a\] as it has more effect on the marked stone and the area above it.]
;B[qj]C[JL: a thick move];W[qh]SL[rn]C[JL: Now the position of the marked white stone is clearly wrong. This move is rather agressive, but I guess it can be played.]
;B[oj]LB[op:a][nq:b]C[JL: If this is the proper direction of play, then this is the best play, but I think black should have played at [a\] or [b\] instead.]
;W[re]LB[oh:a][np:b][oq:c]C[JL: no need to help black take a big corner here, simply a jump at [a\] is much better. A kikashi of [b\] or [c\] first sounds even better.]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[qd];W[of];B[pe]N[aji keshi];W[pf];B[mc]LB[jc:a]
[oq:b][hc:c][np:d]C[At this stage I stopped and thought for a long time. I considered all alternatives in the variations.

JL: There are three relatively weak groups on the right side of the board - any move over there can tilt the balance of power favourably.
For white the only "big" move is [a\], but  even though it needs to be played very soon now to protect against black [c\], I think white should first force at [b\] or [d\], and then continue at [a\]. After that white must remember that he has two weak groups to take care.

I did comment your variations as well.]
(;W[pi]LB[pj:a]C[I settled for a boring move, putting force on the weak black stones and defending my weak white stones.

JL: most of the alternatives you were thinking were much better moves. This move forces black to enforce his weak group while it does little for white.]
;B[pj];W[nl]LB[ol:a][mj:b]C[JL: white must remember that there is now a cutting point in his shap if black plays [a\] at any time. Now black should probably just jump at [b\].]
;B[rh]C[JL: aji keshi];W[rg];B[qi];W[ph]C[JL: Now white almost has eyes here already. Black did not play well here.]
;B[si];W[sd]LB[op:a][nq:b][hc:c]C[This might seem odd, but if he responded my situation would be settled in that area.

JL: it is too early for this move. Black can ignore it as your move is not severe, just about some territory. Black desperately wants to add a move at [a\] or [b\] and after that attack at [c\]. Go is not won by answering to all moves.
   Also white still would not have 100% two eyes if black aswered.]
;B[sc]C[JL: I see black is happy to take the corner. This is simple and nothing wrong with that. Now there will be no aji for white left there.]
;W[se];B[rc]SL[dp]LB[nh:a][mf:b][sg:c]C[Here is the next time I thought about all the big moves explained at move 30. I chose to fight the black group. I don't know why but none of the big moves seemed like nice shape.


JL: Before you attack, check if you have weaknesseess yourself. At the moment, all the white stones except for the marked stone are either weak or thin, and none of them really yet does anything else but exists - where is white territory, where is white moyo?
   The center black group can be attacked, and should be attacked, but not yet as it can escape rather easily, and because neither of the groups surrounding it are solid. Think for example of how much eye shape white has if black stones at [a\], [b\] and [c\] were to appear on the board - some of them might be played to defend the weak black group from a misdirected attack.
   I would play the variation now.]
(;W[sk]LB[rk:a]C[JL: When attacking, one should also consider where to attack, not just which group to attack. By attacking the eye shape of the black group here you force it to either to escape to the center where it is safe while white will have accomplished little, or you force it to make itself eyes as black [a\] is bad for white.
   Whenever considering an attack, always consider why to attack. Killing a single group is hard, and killing can always fail, so usually the reason for an attack should be something else.]
;B[rk];W[sl];B[nq]C[JL: playing in this neighbourhood was important and possible as the center group is not in danger.]
;W[pl];B[rl];W[rm]LB[sm:a]C[JL: [a\] is better];B[sj];W[sm]
LB[mj:a][pk:b][jc:c]C[JL: Silly move. You wanted to attack black by taking away the eyes, but now you change your plan and let black have the eyes just for the sake of three points? This is a very bad move. Instead [a\], or if you insist on killing attack, [b\], or as I would have played, [c\].]
;B[pk];W[sg];B[sh]C[I was especially frustrated with the formation on the top of the board. I didn't know how to extend. Please guide me to the best of the variations.


JL: The top is most important right now, good that you see that. I commented your variations.]

(;W[kc]C[I knew this was daring.

JL: you are asking for a complicated battle with this move. It is greedy and often being greedy is asking for trouble.]
;B[ic];W[ke];B[kb]LB[ie:a]C[JL: a big mistake for black - simple [a\] much better.]
;W[lb];B[lc];W[jb];B[kd];W[jc];B[jd];W[id];B[ie];W[hd];B[mb]
C[JL: this was a local disaster for black. A promising game is now much more even.]
;W[ka];B[je]C[So far so good. Now I contemplated what to do, and I think I decided to make the wrong move.]
;W[me]LB[lf:a]C[This seems stupid afterwards.

JL: shapewise [a\] is better, is it not? The timing of the nozoki is bad anyhow.]
;B[le];W[lf]LB[cn:a]C[JL: it is better to not play this move but to swallow the pride and admit the mistake and tenuki now. [a\] is my move.]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[he];W[gd]C[Is this too conservative?

JL: perhaps, but leaves no aji. Too bad black got sente because of your bad nozoki.]
;B[cn]C[JL: the biggest move.];W[co]SL[ci]LB[bp:a][dk:b]C[The idea with this move was that I could invade below anyway at A15 for example, and that his extensions was not going to be optimal.

JL: if there is the marked stone present, the almost always is it a bad idea to play this tsuke - you help your opponent too much. If you want to corner territory, then [a\] seems better as it creates aji instead of destroying it. The other move to consider is a hasami, perhaps [b\].]
;B[dn];W[gq]C[I chose this lower move since I had the feeling that I was getting behind on territory.

JL: this move is just too loose - the corner is wide open with aji. However, if you get to play one more stone in the corner it will be yours and quite big, but now black has for example the variation. It is almost always better to play more solidly here.]

(;B[eq];W[dq]C[Please give me some alternatives here.

JL: your move is the proper move here.];B[ep]C[JL: You have lots of moves to pick from, hard to say what is best.]
;W[bo];B[do];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[fq]LB[bn:a]C[JL: now white got a large corner in sente, but black got good influence. Please notice that black [a\] is sente. Your next move is important.]
;W[mo]C[Hard to say how good or bad the move is. You have the right idea here - make the group stronger and reduce at the same time.]
;B[gp]LB[bn:a][lp:b]C[JL: very bad move - too slow. First [a\], then [b\] instead.]
;W[iq]C[JL: this seems rather close to thick black wall. Black may attack this group now - it is better to play lighter.]
;B[mp]LB[kq:a][bn:b]C[JL: perhaps [a\] instead. But definately the block of [b\] first.]
;W[hp];B[gr]C[JL: small];W[go];B[hq];W[fo]C[JL: this is a big mistake - too many cutting points already. See variation.]

(;B[ho];W[ip];B[eo];W[hn]C[I thought this was a weird, but alright, trade-off.

JL: white gained a lot. Black blundered badly. See variations of move 98.]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[no];W[nn];B[kp]C[rockston [8k\]: net lag. happens alot here]
;W[fl]LB[bn:a]C[rockston [8k\]: especially to me


JL: White made a mistake and now black should play the variation. Anyhow [a\] is a must move for black now. See the variation.]

(;B[ek];W[el];B[dl];W[fk];B[ej];W[ln];B[kn];W[jo];B[ko];W[km]
;B[jm];W[jn]LB[bn:a]C[I think he was misstaken here.

JL: yes, instead of the hane black should have played a nozoki of [a\] and then a tenuki.]
;B[kl]SL[fk][fl][el][fo][go][hn][jn][jo][hp][ip][iq]LB[jl:a]
C[JL: perhaps better to retain the aji and just play [a\]. This was more aji against the marked stones would remain if white were to protect against the cutting point.]
;W[lm];B[jk]LB[ji:a]C[JL: perhaps a bit slow. The normal way to attack is the boshi of [a\], but your left lower center stones are still slightly weak. Hard to say what to do.]
;W[il];B[jl];W[ik]LB[im:a][hm:b][in:c]C[JL: even though your idea was to strenghten your group, these moves were not optimal - a simple black push of [a\] followed by white [b\] and black [c\] already caaause harm to white eyes giving black potential sente moves later in the game.]
;B[ji];W[ni]C[I decided I couldn't kill the group in the center. Would that have been possible?

JL: probably not. Instead of this move something bigger and/or more threathening is in order. Moves near the sides of the board or usually big now. It has been endgame for a while already so one should count points and think of the value of sente a lot.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[hi];W[gj];B[oo]C[I thought this was small first, realizing later it could have been big.

JL: had you played here, black might have ignored it.];W[fg]
SL[km][lm][ln][mn][nn][mo][nl][pl][pm][po][qn][rn][rm][sm][sl]
[sk]C[JL: hard to say much of the move. The marked white stones are now a bit weak, so at the very least black is now able to make some sente yose plays against it. I can not see a way to kill them, but black should be able to make some small profit in sente.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nj];W[mk];B[mi];W[mj];B[li];W[ro];B[rp];W[so]
C[I fought for my life and got it.

JL: and you will be much stronger when you will avoid tough life and deathhh struggles.]
;B[ir]SL[el][fl][fk][gj][hj][ik][il][hn][go][fo][hp][ip][iq]
[jo][jn]C[Now was another time where I stopped and thought. See variations of thoughts. Please guide me here.

JL: What you want is moves which are as severe as possible - you should do lots of point calculating now and seek to maintain sente. Also consider your opponents sente moves.

I did some commentary on your variations.

Also, you should realize, that there is still some aji left against the marked stones. If white is careless, he sufferes damage.]

(;W[sp]C[JL: Smaller than it looks, and less sente. The variation is how the empire strikes back. Or at least one    or two variations.]

(;B[rq]C[Submissive.];W[dg];B[cg];W[bm];B[bl]C[JL: black plays rather passive yose all the time.]

C[I made this move to make sure that A9 would be sente later.

JL: can you not play this move later? It makes no difference to play it later other than you would have one more ko-threat.]

JL:
    Summary:

You leave too many weaknessess behind when running after the big point or attack. Play more solidly and patiently. Also you need to study the value of sente. The earlier in the game it is, the more sente is worth, but still in the endgame you must seek for those severe sente moves. Avoiding cutting points and learning to sacrifice may also be benefical skills for you. Also improving your reading skill is important - reading is a fundamental skill in the game and everything else in go is based to it.]
