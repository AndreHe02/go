C[Hi! I am SÃ©bastien Moulin, 1k on the French and European rating lists. I will do my best to analyse your game. My comments are introduced by "SM".]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[qk]LB[qi:A]C[B5 It's new move for me. I want play sanrensey...

SM : This move is rather unusual. Black wants to play a game with small groups. But a move one line higher (r10) woud be more natural then. Here white can press with a checking extension at A and black is a little short of space.]
;W[fq];B[qn];W[qo]C[W8 I want to do black overconcentrated.

SM : The r9 stone will indeed end too close to the two-stone wall and the r5 move which induces black q6 is usually good. On the other hand this exchange reinforces black so it is always difficult to know weither r5 is good or bad.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[qf]C[B11 Now I think b5 is not in good place

SM : I agree. It would be better located at q10.];W[nd];B[cn]
;W[dr];B[md]C[B15 It's surprise for me

SM : This move is highly unusual. There is no reason to attach the white group, which should end reinforced. Black will lose the opportunity to attack it later. Moves like n16 are usually played to reduce a moyo, but here there is no moyo and no reason for this move.]

(;W[mc]LB[me:B][ne:A]C[W16 Now I think better at A (O15).

SM : Besides the game move, white can play at A or B. B is the severest but can be a little difficult. A is simple and strong, I'd like to play it here. The game move may be slightly submissive (white answers under black). See a variation for A.]
;B[lc]
(;W[me]LB[ld:A]C[SM : This move is doubtful. The reason is that black has a cutting point at A that he'd like to connect. And white's move just helps him to do that. See variations.]
;B[ld];W[ne]C[W20 Now b17-19 works to left top and has cutting at O17

SM : The cutting point is a burden on white indeed : as black can capture one stone anytime, his three-stone group is not weak.]
;B[hc]LB[hd:A][le:B]C[B21 I think it's low. May be better at A (H16)

SM : This is very flat indeed. A is better, but still too small. Black should rather play at B which is a key point, and aim at attacking white if he plays around A.]
;W[de];B[fd]C[B23 I think it is again overconcentrated. B21 is not in good place

SM : Right, h17 now is nearly useless. Black should have pincered the white stone.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb]LB[bb:A]C[B27 I think it's better at A (B18)

SM : I agree. Black is overconcentrated at the top. His move is overly defensive, there is no need for eye shape here.]
;W[ci]LB[ef:B][ch:A][cl:C]C[W28 Now I think it's better at A (C12)

SM : Both c11 and c12 are joseki. The game move gives black a forcing move at B, but on the other end, it has a severe follow-up at C to attack black. If white plays at A instead, black has no forcing move on the outside but the checking extension of white C is less good because it leaves a weakness behind it. All in all, I think I prefer c11 here.]
;B[dg]
(;W[ef]LB[cg:A]C[W30 may be better at A (C13). Some variants are added.

SM : Yes, I think too that just playing at A to connect your stones is best. Your variations are correct. With the game move, white will have two separated, non alive groups, and e14 may well be the losing move.]
;B[eh]C[SM : Now the connection underneath no longers works. White has two groups to settle and is very busy.]
;W[gf]LB[cl:A][cq:B]C[SM : Maybe checking at A, threatening B and unsettling the black's bottom group, is necessary in this fight. The problem is that g14 has no effect on the strong upper side. On the other hand, I understand thaht white is not confident to live if he is enclosed at the top. So maybe he must sacrifice the bottom stone. Then it would be painful and quite a big loss, anyway.]
;B[dj]
(;W[jp]LB[qe:A][cj:B][rn:H][lp:D][cq:G][hq:C][lq:E][qq:F]C[W34 Now I think it's bad move. May be better at A (R16) or B (C10). Some variants are added.

SM : This move is indeed big but not urgent. The proverb says : "the urgent moves before the big ones". White is still unsettled on the upper left and should play here before all. See the variation. Moreover k4 is not as big as it looks, because it doesn't enclose any sure territory. There are still invasions points at C, D or E, F. The big territorial moves at the bottom are rather G or H to enclose a corner. But the fight in the upper left has top priority.]
;B[lp]LB[cf:A]C[SM : Black proves the lower side is not territory yet. He could also play at A which is a very severe attack.]
;W[lq]LB[qi:C][nn:A][mo:B]C[W36 Now I think it's better at A (O6)

SM : It is not good to attach a weak stone (remember n16), it will only helps it to settle itself. The usual shape move here is at B to separate the black stone frome its allies on the right and to chase it. Maybe this will make the invasion at C attractive a few move later. Note that m3 can't preserve the bottom territory, in fact the bottom was NOT territory.]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[mq]
(;W[mp]LB[lr:A]C[W40  Now I think it's better at A (M2)

SM : If white plays at A, black connects at the marked stone and white's corner is greatly weakened. The game move is therefore correct.]
;B[lr];W[lo];B[iq]C[SM : Usually black connects the ko. White can exchange k3 for k2 and then take the ko in sente here, and black would be forced in a low position.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[hp];B[or];W[qr]LB[qe:A][cj:B]C[W48 Now I think it's bad move :((( and bad idea - to play in the corner - it's small now. Again A (R16) or B (C10) is better.

SM : Yes this is small. Play the k3-k2-m3-l2 sequence in sente to be stronger and then you may consider defending the upper left as shown earlier.]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[fr];W[eq];B[pr];W[qq]LB[qe:A][cf:C][cj:B]C[W54  Again A (R16) or B (C10) is better.

SM : My choice is again C, B is very greedy considering the weak group above.]
;B[lq]C[B55 And now I try to make analysis of position :(((
Black have now 10 points in bottom + 15 points in top + near 15 in left and right = 40 points.
White have no territory only 10-15 points on the full board + komi. It's not enought :((( But white have thickness in cetntre.
And what I can to do???

SM : I agree white is behind. Having two weak groups without points instead of one stable group with a little territory in the upper left is the reason. Now white must find complications to win, maybe invading the right side to use his thickness. But first he must be patient and settle the d15 group, in my opinion.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[dk]LB[cl:A]C[W58 :))) A half-bambo

SM : Weird moves. The usual shape for white 58 is A, to separate efficiently.]
;B[cj];W[bl]C[W56-60 I try to separate black];B[fm];W[fk];B[bk]
;W[cm]LB[bm:A]C[W64 Now I think it's better at A (B7)

SM : I'm not sure as A leaves a cutting point.];B[bm];W[cl]
;B[en];W[ej];B[di]
(;W[bh]LB[bi:A]C[W70 May be better at A (B11)

SM : I think both A and b12 are heavy. White can't save every stone in this fight. He has a weak group on the upper left, and has just created another one around f9. So c11 is best sacrified.]
;B[bi];W[ch];B[cg]
(;W[bf]LB[bg:A]C[W74 Now I think it's mistake. May be better at A (B13). But what after b75 at w74???
Some variants added.

SM : A is indeed the usual shape to gain liberties, but it is difficult to say what white can do with these stones. Trying to save c11 was not a good idea.]
;B[bg];W[ai];B[bj];W[ag];B[be];W[cf];B[df];W[ce]
(;B[dh]LB[ee:A]C[B83 Thanks :) What to do if b83 at A (E16).
I found only ko for white group in corner :(((

SM : Indeed black wasted a move completely here. White is not alive if black cuts, this demonstrates how unreasonable saving c11 was.]
;W[ee];B[aj];W[qh]LB[qe:A][qi:B]C[W86 May be better at A (R16)

SM : B is more severe against the bottom group which is the target to press aginst white's thickness here. The r14 stone maybe be treated lightly and sacrificed, so A may not be so good.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[pg]
(;W[pi]LB[ph:A]C[W90 May be better at A(Q12)

SM : Yes A is usually the correct shape, pressing harder.];B[rc]

(;W[ni]LB[rb:A]C[W92 Probably I must play at A (S18)

SM : I like the game move. If black spends a lot of second line moves to live at the top right, white should be happy and will attack the bottom right group in return.]
;B[qb];W[mb]C[W94 ??? Imho my only chance is attack black 5-7-9

SM : It is very strange to try to save the n17 now. Why not blocking at q18 to make life difficult for black?]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[qd]C[SM : Black got an easy life because of n18.]

(;W[nn]LB[rm:A]C[W98 Imho attack must be stronger - A (S7) for example

SM : Your move is good shape but your variation starting with A seems interesting. You read well overall.]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[ri];W[rh];B[qi];W[ph];B[nk];W[pk]C[SM : Good, o9 was risky.]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[ol];W[jb]LB[jc:A][nl:B]C[W110 I want at A (K17), but ...
May be better cut at B (O8)

SM : Yes, q9 and p9 make sense only if you cut at B. The black group is still not clearly alive (what happens if white plays at s7?).]
;B[jc];W[lb];B[ib];W[kc];B[kd];W[kb];B[id];W[cq]C[W118 I want some terr

SM : Big, besides territory, it gives life in case of cut at f4, and attacks black.]
;B[el];W[ek]LB[fl:A]C[SM : A is more efficient to protect the cut (it is toward the center, and destroys an eye).]
;B[gi];W[hk];B[cp];W[bq];B[bn];W[je];B[ie];W[jf]C[SM : Heavy, white is nit alive in the upper left so it is dangerous to be enclosed and not the time for creating another groupe nearby.]

;B[gj];W[gk];B[bc];W[gg];B[ad];W[hh];B[ig];W[gh];B[fi];W[ii]
;B[ij];W[ji];B[li]C[SM : White has many groups, he seems on the verge to collapse.]
;W[jd];B[kh];W[kj];B[al]C[B155 - last recorded move. I'm behind near 20 points :((( and beyomi

SM : The fight is still unfinished but indeed the game is difficult for white.

My general impression about this game is that you are strong tactically, you provided your game record with many interesting sequences. But you may lack of some global view sometimes. Remember how it is important to respect some basic principles like connecting your stones, separating the opponent's stones. For instance white 18 (o15) helps black to connect, white 30 (e14) fails to connect white groups. Remember also that it is usually not good to attach to a weak stone, it helps the opponent to settle it (white 36 at m3). Finally, in a difficult situation give some way and don't try to save every stone (please compare the sequence starting with white 70 (b12) that leads to disaster to the suggested variation for white 34 at c14 that saves almost everything).

Have fun playing go!])
