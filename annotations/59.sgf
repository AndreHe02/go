C[Comments by Black player, RazorBrain, will be proceeded by "RB:"     
RB: My questions about this game center around what I can do differently in the center when I have outside influence . I just made a huge mess out of the center in this game. Help!]
;B[pq]C[Hello,    I want to concentrate on the two topics which I think are most important.        1. aims and overview    2. mojos        If you have any other questions on this game, please ask. This is the easiest way to improve !]
;W[dq];B[pc];W[cd];B[co];W[cp];B[cl];W[ec];B[qf]C[Until here there are only quite usual moves and the result is even.      Nevertheless you can debate about which move is a little bit more effective almost every time.    It is not to interesting for us now, because there are more basic problems to deal with. Keep it for dan players :-)]
;W[qp]C[This one is very close to 1, so it could easily get under presure .    It압 better to play one line higher.]
;B[qq]C[Now you decided to take the corner. That압 o.k., but I would prefer to play on the 4-4 point to get influence to the left.    If W then takes the corner, you can push him very low with R5 and get even more influence.]
;W[pp];B[rp]C[Youre consequent, but again getting to open space and building up influence on the lower side would be more interesting.    If you play P4 your corner would become bigger and stonger too.]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[qj]C[Difficult situation!    Sometimes it압 obvious in which area you have to play (e.g. 9 or 11) .   
But after 16 there is no urge.   
Now you can pause and think about your strategy.   
The important questions are     
1. what is the standing   
2. what must I do to have more territory than my opponent in the end   
   
This sound verry easy, but it isn앖.   
*You have to ask you this questions as often as possible during a game.   
*You have to know who is leading to decide if you must play more aggressive or you can concentrate on the security of your areas.     
*You have to decide which part of the board is most important now and how you can profit most from your next move.   
   
What I want to say is try to get an overview und ask you about your aims almost every move.]
;W[oq]C[17 is no verry strong attack on the W group and as an extension to make territory K16 would have been better.    If you use 17 to strengthen your lower right corner, it becomes stronger (saver), you get points and influence and the pressure on W increases.   
   
I think you should play in the lower right corner or on the upper side.]
;B[jq]
(;W[lq];B[fq];W[bo];B[bn];W[ao];B[cn]C[Better D5 to threaten to connect your groups, what should be an aim (!) of high priority now.]
;W[eq]C[W can cut at D/ E/ F 4/ 5 or E3, as played.];B[dp];W[bq]
C[Atari on 27 cuts. W then no longer is sealed in and can easily afford to give up 22 and 24.]
;B[ep];W[cg]C[There is still a cutting point at F4.    This means 27 and 29 don앖 reach the aim (no other move does).   
Therefore you should concentrate on another aim and keep this connection for later as a threat.]
;B[ci];W[ic];B[kc];W[gd]C[Now it압 time to say something about mojos.    There is a difference between influence and territorry.      Until the connections between your stones aren앖 really tight, you should look at these areas as spheres of influence.    This makes it difficult to deal with big mojos, because to build them up you must accept looser connections between your stones, e.g. if you play now K10 or L15 or something like that.    So you have to decide wether you want to build up smaler areas to extend from or you build big influence and take the risk to be invaded. It압 a matter of taste.        W now can play J14 or 15 .]
;B[eh]C[You can try to build up mojos around the lower left or/and the upper right corner.    This move bases on the good idea to build the wall you want anyway by pressing on whites potential area. Even better would be L15 because of the greater distance the white areas have from the upper right (this makes it more difficult to invade) and the cut at F4.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[fe];B[gf]C[What did you want with this ?    If you want to protect 37 and 39, what isn앖 important now, play F/G 12. If you want to build a mojo (better) jump to some point on the right or elsewhere, but this move is much to slow.]
;W[qc]C[W cannot give you the whole upper right quarter of the board, but it would be much easier just to walk trough the gap between 42 and 33.    If W anyway wants to invade this deep, he should do it at R16 because this is the weak point of the connection between 3 and 9.]
;B[qd];W[rc];B[qb]C[good!];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[This invasion usually dies and you played well.    W cannot reach the 4th line because of 9, so it would be better to prevent him from taking the corner by playing S18.    But 49 isn앖 bad and W still dies...]
;W[rb]
(;B[ra]C[When youre not sure wether you can kill a group, have a look at the situation and think about your aims.    In this situation Q18 would be good even if you think W can live then. You then have a strong influence on the upper side with no weak points left in your wall. Only a move that kills W surely would be better.]
;W[pb]C[Now W lives.];B[ob];W[qa];B[se];W[oc];B[pd];W[nb]C[RB: I really screwed this corner up. I'm just not sure what I should have done differently.        MG: As I said you played well, but at one point you weren앖 sure how to kill W but tried it anyway.    If youre not sure don앖 be greedy, try to play as if the opponent lives and make the best of it. If he dies later it압 even better.]

;B[oj];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[mm];B[mj];W[ll];B[lk]C[This sequence was good because it consequently followed one idea.]
;W[kl];B[lm]C[After the invasion in the upper right W has a "small" lead (if you count the lower right corner as living), so you have to play a bit aggressively.   
   
First estimate the standing. I would say you have to make about 30 points more in the middle than W to get a close match. But you have big potential, too.   
The 41/67 and 19/77 gaps are to big to get the middle completely. If this is your only chance to win you must cut with 79 and fight, even if your chances are low.   
But you don앖 have to!   
Making points in the lower left quarter (by playing now e.g. K5) and some more in the upper half is still ambitious but easier and more realistic and thus the better plan.]
;W[kn];B[mn];W[nm];B[ln]SQ[kk][jk][go][im]C[RB: I thihnk this last series was a mistake. I just through these stones away. Looking back i think I would have been better off playing one or the marked points.        MG: Right, see my comment to move 79.]
;W[km];B[ko];W[lo];B[lp];W[mo];B[kq];W[mp];B[mq];W[kp];B[jp]
;W[jo];B[io];W[in]C[RB: Now I've let white out into my middle area. Ouch!        MG: It would have been better to take less risk and play around 94 much earlier.]
;B[hp]C[Why not H5?];W[ho];B[ip];W[go];B[gp]C[After you gave up your cutting stones (around 79) till now you don앖 seem to have a new plan.   
Especially 99 and 101 are much to slow.];W[lr];B[or]C[Verry good, verry urgent!]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[kr]C[To slow, youre behind!    You won앖 catch up with endgame moves like this. If you see no more chance better resign and play a new game - you will learn much more of it!        I would try to close 41/67 in sente and then extend from 77 to the left. If this is unsuccesful it압 time to resign.]

;W[hh];B[ji];W[ij];B[fj];W[gj]C[RB: I'm not even sure what I was thinking here. I just know I made a mess in the middle. :-(   
   
MG: 113 to 121 look quite desperate. You can do things like that as a last try but if they fail better resign.]

;B[hf];W[id];B[jd];W[if];B[je];W[fh]C[RB: I just feel out of control in the middle. (I was playing a little faster than I was comfortable with. I'm sure this was part of my problem.   
   
MG: Of course it could be, so play slower :-)   
   
Your problem was that the situation in the middle started when you were behind in points at the edges.   
So you tried to get more out of your influence than it was worth it and because of getting desperate you lost almost all your strategy.   
Mistakes like 167 will happen in every game, nobody will ever play perfectly. It압 only important to be concentrated and make the best out of every situation.]

;W[dg];B[ng]C[RB: Paranoia?        MG: Yes!    There is much to less space to make two eyes.    If there would be a weak point in the surounding walls it would be better to eliminate this weakness, but there is no one.]

It is difficult , even more for beginners, to estimate the value of influence and to use it efficiently.

Perhaps you should concentrate more on the edges of the board .



That압 it. I hope you find my comments helpful.
