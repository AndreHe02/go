C[Dear Daniel,

As I'm not a big tactician, I'll focus on the strategy in this game by pointing out a few places where you missed a good opportunity to take the game in your hands. I pointed out some variations, but by trying yourself you can sometimes find other and maybe better ones.

In general it seems to me that you play a (sometimes too) solid game and that you should try to take the initiative a bit more.

I hope you'll find my comments useful.
Frank];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[nc]C[Frank: I prefer to play at the bottom against the Chinese opening, but that's a question of taste.]
;B[pf];W[ic];B[jp]C[Frank: Good point.];W[qh];B[fq]LB[oh:a]
C[Frank: Undoubtful a good point, but white might ignore it to play at a (p12) and take the initiative]
;W[fp]C[Frank: This strenghtens black and loses the initiative since black has a stone on k4.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq]
(;B[dj]C[Frank: Mistake. Black wants to establish a group on the left side in whites sphere of influence. Black should do this by playing on the third line. See variation. After white 18 it's very difficult for black to do something on the left bottom side.]
;W[dl];B[cf]
(;W[dh]C[Frank: Overplay. Usually the right invasion point in this shape is C12. See variation]

;B[bf];W[gd]C[Frank: Good, connects his stones];B[ck]C[Frank: Very slow.. This strenghtens white. Black is not in danger, so he can tenuki. If he's afraid better immediately on F10.]
;W[cl];B[fj];W[eb]C[Franks: This prevents a black sente move on E18 or D18, but...]

(;W[ko]C[Frank: Overplay. A more reasonable way of playing for white is in the variation.]

(;B[kp]C[Frank: Missed opportunity 3.  Since the white group right under is still very weak, white can't afford to invade so deep as with 82. This is the moment to play a splitting attack. See variation.]
