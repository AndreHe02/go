(;W[dd]C[will d17 be a better move?

Well, I think it is too early for you to try to push throu like this, there is no hope to cut this group yet so why do you want to force him to connect? Think like this, this move is useless, it does not acomplish anything for you but it strenthes you opponent, I cannot say that it is totally bad, but I am sure that there are other places in the board you can explore before turning back in this point in particular

D17 is worse, have a look at the variation!];B[ed];W[fe]C[this is to create a bad shape for the opponent.
but at this moment, is it an acceptable move?

after reviewing, i feel that it makes the opponent stronger.

Yes, I think it is too early for this, Imagine if black gets to play at Q10, you will not be pleased will you? So I think this move is not good at the moment, specially  because black does not worry about this cut. If black let white cut, he can live in the corner first playing at G17, and then he can jump either to J18 or C18.]
;B[ee];W[dg];B[eg];W[je];B[ic]C[White stones are going to suffer an attack because of the strong position they have by the E15 group that you helped become strong.]
;W[gh];B[fh]
(;W[jg]C[should i still strengthen here, or move somewhere else, say the lower right corner?
Well, the game is open and so is the center, I think K13 is not necessary at this moment, the group seem to be safe without it, so you could try to occupy another big point could't you? It would be very healthy to your territory balance if you could take either K4, Q10, or folow the joseky in the variation that I showed!]
;B[me];W[po]C[Nice!];B[qm]C[Yes, it is difficult for black to play the other joseki, specially because, doesn't matter what happens in the bottom corner, black will try to build a good wall growing towards the center hoping to turn the right side into territory, you will have to be carefull not to let this happen!]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[rq];W[qr];B[ro]
;W[oq];B[rm];W[on];B[pm];W[qh]C[i feel that i should drop in, but is this too deep?  would somewhere in the q line be better, say q12?

Well there are other ways to try to invade this moyo, like your Q12 or P12

I think this move wass too deep, an overplay];B[qj]C[You were lucky, you opponent played wrong:

"Drive your opponent towards your thickness"

What wold have happened if he played the capping move at P12?
 White would be in trouble, right?];W[qf];B[oe];W[oh];B[mh]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[rh];W[ri]C[sacrificing one stone to gain sente.

You have to be careful with these moves, make sure that you have read out the whole sequence, have you thought the possibility that black not giving atary to these stone? Playing something like S13? Take a look at the variation]

(;B[rj];W[rg];B[si]
(;W[pk]C[i think i misuse my sente; jumping towards the centre, say o10,  would be better, right?

Yes, this move is too slow, you can jump as far as N10 withou being cut! See variation]
;B[fq]
(;W[jp]C[i was thinking of expanding from the right, and pincing the black at the same time.  would j4 be better?  i was worried about the breaks at p4 and p5.

Well, Can I give you an advice? Read the whole sequence before placing a stone! Go is like LIFE! You always have to make decisions that will turn you in one way or another, after you execute the act, there is no turning back and you will either enjoy your winnings or will face the consequences. That's why we have to always think before oppening our mouth or placing a stone. That's why professionals take a lot of time! 

White can extend as far as H3! I would even consider missing this spot!

Let's see what would happen? See variation];B[dn];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[eq];W[do];B[cr];W[ei]C[is this a good move?

i have to purpose in mind for this move:
(a) to create bad shape for the opponent,
(b) to support the next move at d8.

Yes I liked the way you thinked, if your opponent follows your plan it will be very nice to you, just remember two things:
The G14 group is not safe yet!
What would happen if black plays D11 to connect to the D6 stone, or even F11 preparing to attack the G12 group?

Always be sure to read the whole sequence out!];B[eh];W[dl]
;B[cb]C[It ended up being good for you!];W[bc];B[go];W[hq]C[should i have move somewhere else instead of here?

No, I think it was a nice move, it strenthens the bottom side in sente!]
;B[gq];W[fn];B[lp]C[I think Black invaded too deep now, it must be punished! How about L6 driving your opponent towards your thickness?]

(;W[np]C[i feel that this move is more secure than n4 or other position.

Very bad move, there is no need for this! See variation];B[kq]
C[Here the black group is becoming strong too, remember that you have thickness but so does black!]
;W[mq]C[was thinking of securing territory and attacking.  is there any better move?

First, the territory you are securing is very small!
Second, if you are gong to attack, try adding a stone to the K4 group (how about K3? Try to save your group and at the same time you push your opponent agains your wall!]
;B[kn]C[Now the two white stones are in trouble!];W[ko]C[A fierce and unecessary fight is going to take place!]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mn];W[lm];B[no];W[oo];B[om];W[jn]C[i was choosing between k6 and n7.  in the end, i feel that if i take n7, the three stones on the left would be in danger ground.
I think you chose correctly];B[nn];W[pr];B[nm];W[nd]C[looking at the situation, i don't have much territory, whereas black has a huge one on the upper right.  so i decided to invade there and chose this point.
will o17 be better?

I don't think that Black is so muck in your front!
You have a lot of potential for making territory if you start by playing at F11 for example

You can invade by attaching at R17 or even just jumping to T16 in sente, then turning your attention to H17 and attacking the black E12 group!]
;B[od];W[ne];B[nf];W[mc];B[pf]C[black made use of the oppontunity and attacked my group.]
;W[pg];B[qe]C[I think that this blakc move is a mistake, he could just have killed you by playing N16 first and then turning to R5 or so...]
;W[kc]C[insteading of securing at s15, i tried to cause disruption in the black camp.  i feel that if i don't do it now, the game will be lost.

That's the spirit!];B[md];W[nc];B[lc];W[lb];B[ld];W[jc];B[hb]
C[i think this is a bad move for black.  i think h17 or k16 might be better.
K17 is a much better move! it aims at L18!];W[jd];B[kb];W[pb]
C[trying to survive.]
(;B[mb]C[This is a mistake, black shold have played at P17 first! See variation!]
;W[nb];B[la];W[qc]C[trying to find more space to form two eyes.]

(;B[jb]C[i find that this is a bad move for black.  i would have attacked the upper right if i were black.

bad mistake! Should have played at S17, see variation!];W[oc]
;B[rf];W[og];B[of]C[forming one 'true eye' and at the same time attacking black.

Good combination! But remember that if your opponent has a chance of playing P11, your "real" eye will be turned into a false one!]
;W[qg]C[no choice but to fill in, but also aim at s15.
however, it seems to be a wrong move.  escaping towards the centre would have been better.

Good move, it is sente, if he doesn't respond to your move you will get two eyes, but if he respond you can still go back and jump to the center!]
;B[ni]C[this was a very serious threat.

Indeed!];W[re];B[rd];W[sf];B[rb]C[Bad mistake, he should have played at P11 and made your eye false!]

Black's next move has to be O13];B[mf]C[i feel that this move was not necessary for black.]
;W[nh]C[at this point, white seems to have escaped.

is there any sequence after this move where the white group on the right is still dead?  i have tried a few, but seems to manage to escape.

No, white has managed to poke his head off and resurected a dead group!]
;B[lg];W[mi];B[oj];W[lh];B[hn];W[im];B[hm];W[ij]C[to gain some territory in the centre.  would a move on the left be better, or on the lower left?

No, this is the one];B[dc];W[bn]C[i'm not sure about this move.  any better one?
 the D4 group is not yet alive and the two E11 stones might come under heavy attack one time or another, so why not connect them with E9?]
;B[em];W[dm];B[fm];W[gn]C[aim at breaking g7 or h5.];B[in];W[jm]
;B[ho];W[gm];B[fi];W[ek]C[this seems to be a wrong move.  it cannot trap the two black.  even if i managed to rescue the two white, the whole white group is still in danger.

I said that earlier didn't I? Well the best you could do is to take the two black stones and let black take the two white stones, and you would end up in sente to play somewhere like H2]

;W[am];B[ao];W[co];B[aq];W[gl]C[this seems to be a very bad move to me.  don't know why i make this move at that time.

thanks in advanced for taking your time in making the comments.

Well, it would do a lot of good to your game if you try to read the sequence througthout before playing, take your time. If the time you have set is not enough then you should seriously consider increasing the time set for your next games.

Remeber to use thickness to attack, no to surround territory!

Keep on playing, and enjoying, that's the main point in playing Go!

Good luck!])
