;B[pe]C[hello reviewer.];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[pc];W[cf];B[df]
;W[dg];B[ce];W[ef];B[de];W[eg]C[f16 here?

yip:
Right now, white's development seems to be superior to black's.  Black's stones seem to be a little redundant, and focused only on the upper side.  It would probably have been better to make a pincer instead of D14 to leave more options.

As it stands, F16 is a major point; if white gets to play there, then black will be practically sealed in on the top, with no place to develop.  If black plays there now, though, white will be able to take an even bigger point (probably around R10).

I'd say that the best course right now would be for black to leave the upper side, but start to develop another area of the board, hoping to come back later to fix the upper left.  Also keep in mind R10 as a good extension from the upper right.

The best place to not disrupt any of the potential in the other areas, and still try to keep sente looks like F3 to me.  F16 is just too slow.]
;B[jc]TR[fd][je]C[yip:
Again, black is putting a lot of emphasis on the top side, with little potential anywhere else.  Not only that, but the top is still thin.

Reducing or attacking at F16 would both be difficult for black to respond to, and would still leave weak points even after black defends.]
;W[md]C[yip:
...but this is a poor play by white.  It's too close to a solid black position, and results in an open invitation to be attacked.  Black is extremely happy to play K15, as it harrasses the white stone, and helps the upper left.

White should reduce at K15, or just extend along the right side.  F16 would be good, too.]
;B[mf]C[yip:
Wrong direction by black.  Black should attack while reinforcing the weak stone.  That would also help to make territory in the top left; N14 does nothing for territory.]

(;W[kc]C[yip:
White should focus on escape, not strengthening black's weaknesses by attaching. M14 would be better here, also leaving some potential in the upper left..]
;B[jd]C[yip:
White forces black to do what black desperately wants to do anyway.]
;W[lf]TR[kc][jd]C[yip:
Now the marked exchange is terrible for white.  Why strengthen the weak black stone before fleeing?]
;B[nf];W[gd];B[jf];W[lg]C[did I handle this ok?

yip:
K14 seems fine; black can settle at any time by cutting, so isolating the weak white stones is good.]
;B[le]C[in hindsight (tewari) this is mybe better elsewhere?]

;B[lh];W[ng];B[mg];W[ec]C[to tenuki here by white is a bit bold?

yip:
Not really; white should've let those stones go a long time ago.  B14 was the sign that white gave up all hope of rescue, and O13 removed the last slim chance of doing something by cutting off the N12 stones..  There's no way the N17 group can escape now.]
;B[cc];W[ac];B[bd];W[ad];B[be];W[ae];B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[dc]
;B[ab];W[af];B[bc];W[da];B[cb];W[ci]C[i manage to live! but now what is best?

yip:
Black has a small life in the upper left, and a large upper right, but white has a huge potential moyo over the rest of the board.  A light move around K4 would be interesting, to see how white responds.  Then, black can go after the opposite side.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq]C[e3 just feels all wrong

yip:
It's a solid move.  White should respond, otherwise black gets the corner as well as the ability to poke out into the center.]
;W[lq]
(;B[pn]C[is q6 good? what could be a better move?

yip:
F4 would be good (variation).  White is still thin, but black needs thickness to be able to invade effectively.]
;W[pl]C[how do i handle this q8 move?

yip:
I'd attach at R8, towards white's stronger side.]
(;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[op];B[rq];W[qr];B[or]C[yip:
This isn't a good move; white is too strong down here, and will be able to connect or escape easily.]

(;W[pm];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[qn];B[po];W[mo]C[i played this wrong somewhere. now white has a big advantage in bottom. help!

yip:
First, there was no reason for black to play P2.  Looking there now, it's clear that it's a wasted stone that just helped white become stronger.  S5 was also slow; black can't make two eyes there, so the only option is to escape.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[nl]C[yip:
O8 isn't very good; black has basically escaped now, so the left side now becomes much larger.  The bottom also has some aji left, though it's not as urgent right now.]
;B[fp];W[fn];B[fo];W[eo];B[jq];W[jp]C[how should i play here? i waspushed for time but h4 doesnt seem the best move. mybe j4?

yip:
H4 seems fine.  J4 allows white to push and separate the black stones.]

(;B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jr];B[jo];W[kq];B[ko];W[cl]C[yip:
H6 seems more interesting.  Black shouldn't be able to invade the left side anyway, so this move is redundant.]

C[i counted that black was ahead by 20 points mybe here. so mybe a less risky move than g10

mybe l7? h10? j10?

yip:
G14 is interesting.  When you're ahead, play conservatively.  Don't give the opponent a chance to catch up by attacking something vulnerable.]

even though this was a big win.
how could i have improved my bottom right and bottom left approaches taking into account the whole board position?

any help would be appreciated,

thanks in advance.


yip:
Black seemed to be too focused on territory, and not on making the stones work together.  This was most apparent in the opening, when black was confined to the top.

The best advice would be to play lightly in the situations where you don't have much influence, and try to get a base without solidifying the opponent too much.

Just as a side note, generally it's more useful to submit a game that was lost, but for an unknown reason.  That way, the reviewer can give indications as to what went wrong, and help to improve those areas.

I hope the review was helpful.])

This is painful for white; it threatens the D4 group with a followup at B4, as well as weakening the H3 stone.
