C[Hello reviewer

this game i kept counting and the score was close all the game.


your comments are appreciated.

Thanks,

Neil

Nathan:

Hi there,

I found the tone of this game to be very leisurely, especially the middle-game when there were opportunities for fighting (move 43).  Instead, there was passivity.  Go is a fighting game and it is best to practice fighting skills as much as possible (especially if your opponent commits makes overplays).  Look for leaning attacks whenever possible and remember to lean on strong groups/stones, not weak ones.

Moves 123 and 125 were like passing - considering the close final score, they may have been losing moves.

Because you were behind going into the endgame and the game continued to be leisurely, it was difficult to catch up without big mistakes from the opponent.]

;B[ce];W[jd];B[oc]C[N: Two enclosed corners is really good.]
;W[mc]
(;B[qk]LB[gc:B][hc:A]C[N: A or B is better, as letting W play around here gives him a good base for his stones.  Also, B can then aim at C.

R9 looks too far away from the upper right corner.];W[fc]LB[gc:A]
[hc:B]C[N: Good for W but I would've play at A.  B is certainly a weak spot to aim for.]
;B[qn]LB[dq:A][eq:B]C[N: I prefer A or B];W[fe];B[nq];W[oo]
;B[qq]LB[lp:A]C[N: I prefer A.  When W blocks at Q3, B O3 is weakened (but this is ther trade-off for jumping into the corner with R3 and making lots of profit).]

(;B[ph]LB[qf:C][qi:D][hq:B][iq:A]C[N: A or B is honte - make sure your groups are safe from attack.  B Q12 is greedy and doesn't even do a good job of securing territory (weaknesses at C and D).]
;W[pr]LB[jp:A]C[N: This should have been A];B[hq]C[my opponent paused a long time after this move

N: Your lower group is rather thin]

N: This looks too narrow.  I prefer A.];W[cj];B[ch]LB[mm:B]
[nn:A]C[the fuseki seems to end now and i think black is quite good]
;W[cm]C[N: Game looks about even.  W has the one eyeless group in the lower right but it is very thick and hard to attack.

This game has been very leisurely so far.];B[rm];W[jp];B[jq]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[lo];B[mp];W[mo];B[dj]LB[gn:A][ko:B]C[N: I think a move around is A is better as it diminishes any hope of centre territory for W.  Also, B has the cut at B to aim for.]
;W[dk];B[di];W[pf]
(;B[qf]LB[md:A]C[N:  Not only has the fuseki been leisurely, so is the middle-game!  This move is quite passive.

A leaning attack at A is what I'd consider playing.];W[pd]
(;B[pc]C[N: B is trying to keep all of the territory here but that is not possible after playing R14 and Q17.]
