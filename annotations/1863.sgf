Rich - Hi there.];B[dd];W[pq];B[cp];W[pc];B[jp];W[jc];B[ec]
C[Ben: C10 might have been more productive?
Chris:  Definitely would have given me more territory.
***

Rich - This is an unusual move; a play on the 4-4 point is never a territorial move anyway, as on its own it can be invaded at the 3-3 point. If you want to make territory from it, a play at D17 is much more solid; this neither makes territory nor upsets white's plans. 

I think a play at Q10 (or R10), or an approach around R5, would have been more productive. Black has the advantage of first play - he should keep white on the back foot.]
;W[pj];B[lq]C[***

Rich - Again, a move that doesn't upset white's plans or do much to extent your influence. An attack, or a mid-side point, would be effective.]
;W[cj]C[Chris:  Here I saw the mistake by not playing a stone on the side there.]
;B[cg];W[cm];B[eo];W[ch];B[bg]C[***

Rich - This is a play for much later on, after the groups are more settled. If you try and make territory too early, you end up with small areas. Compare black's top and bottom left with white's large, influential framework.]
;W[bh]C[***

Rich - generally in the early game, you should move out to the centre if you get to close fighting. Especially with white's influence at the top and right, this move answers a small point with another small one.]

(;B[df]TR[cg][bg]C[***

Rich - this makes little territory, really - the two /\ stones are safe enough. If you want to get territory, how about H17? Better yet, invade before white starts turning that influence into territory. See vars.]
;W[qo]
(;B[mc]C[Ben: would R15 have been a better place to invade?

***

Rich - Depends on your plan. :) This is a good point - if you are chased out into the centre you can turn and attack the weaker of K17 and Q17. If white goes for a steady defense at Q15, he gets a big corner, but you can maybe make a lot of profit at the top. See vars.]
;W[md];B[nd];W[ld]C[Ben: i probably should have played R15 to protect my corner better.]
;B[pd];W[qd];B[oc]C[Chris: Q15 might have been a better way to go at this point.

***

Rich - Maybe; this isn't bad, though, it leaves you with lots of chances to make eyes for your invading group.]
;W[gc]C[Chris:  This is what gave black the corner.

***

Rich - Yes, black potentially gains at least twice as many points in the corner as white makes on the side.]
;B[qc]C[Chris:  If white had played here, I don't think I'd have made life.]

(;W[qe]C[Ben: what about R18?

***

Rich - see var.];B[rc];W[pe];B[pb];W[nf];B[oe]C[***

Rich - This makes white play a move he wants to play anyway, to build a wall...]
;W[of]
(;B[lc]C[***

Rich - and again, forcing white to connect. If you could have cut and had a ladder breaker for the stone, this would be a better move. See var.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[mb]C[Chris: M19 would have been better.]
;W[mo];B[nq];W[op];B[hn];W[km];B[np];W[no];B[sf]C[Ben: This is where things start to get interesting.  I knew that i was vulnerable to a monkey jump like this, but i wasn't expecting it so soon.

Chris:  It was looking bleak on that side, so I thought I needed to invade soon.  This probably was more of an endgame move.

***

Rich - yep, it's endgame. The invasion needed to happen before the lower right got started. Now any invasion can only escape to the upper left - right across the board! - unless you can capture or kill something. Using the monkey jump just to reduce territory will also make the territory left even stronger.]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[sg];B[se];W[qg]C[Ben: after this move i pretty much figured the attack was over. If i had played at S13 instead, i might have avoided the second wave.]
;B[sh];W[rg];B[qi]C[Chris:  I must have been tired when I played this because I don't think I would have tried this otherwise.]
;W[qk];B[rj];W[pi]C[Ben: I had never seen an invasion of this sort before.  it was very low, so i tried to pin him against the side.]
;B[rk];W[rh];B[si];W[ri];B[fk]C[Chris:  E8 instead?

***

Rich - with groups on the third line, it is often hard to really press the attack. E8 would be a more stable shape for your group, but white may have ended up with more central territory.]
;W[em]
(;B[fm]C[***

Rich - You don't need to defend here... Stone 63 is a ladder-breaker for the cut at L16. See vars.]
;W[ek];B[fi];W[ei]C[Chris:  Had I played on the 5th line instead, he'd have been smaller.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[hd];W[hc]
(;B[fb]C[***

Rich - Cut at L16!];W[id]C[Ben: G18 might have been better.

***

Rich - No, this is better; it defends the cut, and allows you to go into the centre. G18 is a only couple of points.]
;B[gb]C[Ben: i think now i realized that i wouldn't be able to make any livable eye-space there.  so i decided to give up on it and just connect them with the center.]
;W[jj];B[jl]C[Chris:  K13?

***

Rich - better - this makes white build a big wall around a lot of territory; K13 could have let black build a wall into the territory.]

(;W[jf]C[***

Rich - same goes for white - sitting back and surrounding territory stone by stone is a very slow way to play. See var.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[hh]C[Chris:   I should have played somewhere else.  The whole string leading up to here just encouraged white to build a nice wall]
;W[jh];B[ql]C[Ben: the third wave.   :)]
(;W[qm]C[Chris: Q9?

***

Rich - Black should die anyway. I'd prefer S7 for white. See var.]

;W[rp]C[Ben: is there a better defense than this?  possibly because S7 isn't connected to a living group?

Rich -Black's dead - what better defence do you need? :) The monkey jump only makes territory, not eyes.]

;W[oo];B[jo];W[im];B[hm];W[kk];B[el]C[***

Rich - B6 would be a bigger move to reduce white's territory here. If you push at weak boundaries, you make them stronger.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[co];B[do];W[cn];B[bo]C[***

Rich - This leaves you weak and having to defend when white responds... B4 would leave you with the threat of (yet another!) monkey jump later in the game.]

;W[ej];B[fj];W[hb];B[fc]C[***

Rich - This is not worth any points; worse, it costs them because white keeps attacking. At the end of the game you need to try to take and keep the initiative.]

Rich - there is a ko here, where you have fairly little to lose...]
;B[lb];W[ne];B[od];W[gf]C[***

Rich - This is a move that should be saved until you have to make it; it's not even a ko threat at the moment.]
;B[fh]C[Ben: Smart move.  i filled in at G14 because i was planning on attacking the group at G12.

***

Rich - G12 is safe; D12 or E13 would at least give to potential to pick up a point for black.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[re];B[kp];W[kn]C[***

(;B[io]C[***

Rich - J6 would also be a safe move, and get an extra point for you. See var.]
;W[ps];B[or];W[dn];B[fp]C[Ben: I think this was a very good move.  at this point in the game i was not looking to attack majorly, but if i had, that probably would have been my invasion spot.]

Rich - This should come after A13 - see (long) var.];B[fa];W[ha]
;B[rq]C[Chris:  Another wasted stone...];W[qq];B[cc]C[Ben: another good invasion point?

***

Rich - You would have to rely on black making a major mistake in defending to get a white living group in this space.]
;W[so];B[cq]C[***

Rich - Two moves after each other playing in your own territories... it balances out in the end, but it's not necessary. :) Under time limits, though, it's easy to think 'better safe than sorry' - and often correct!]

Ben:  That's it.  Chris played very strong.  i think if he changed his opening strategy slightly, he would have beaten me.  that big invasion on the right side cost him a lot of points.

Chris:  Yes, the invasion was a bad bad bad idea.  Also, white shouldn't have been able to have such a large group on the right side.  There wasn't a lot of fighting in this game.  Had Ben played more aggressively on the top right, he'd have really clobbered me.

***

Rich - Even after the invasion, there were only a few points in it; Black also had a large territory (moyo) at the bottom. Some people have a style that's more suited to claiming and developing large areas and some to taking and defending solid territory - in this game, it looked like white and black respectively.

However, I think where black's strategy suffered was from claiming territory too possessively. Even by move 12 the game looked very good for white - especially with komi! If you look through the game, in trying actively to cut off small areas in the top corners and bottom right, black gives white a couple of strong walls to build a large moyo. 

Playing moves that *only* seal off territory is something best left to the endgame, when the areas have been more or less established - and certainly out of the opening stages. Try to look for moves that not only build your territory, but also attack or pressure your opponent; playing move 17 two spaces lower, for instance.

I thought black and white were fairly evenly matched for fighting skills; black may even have had an advantage, judging from the top-right situation. If you prefer fighting to moyo-building, take the fight to your opponent!

If black plays a little more relaxed, more assuredly, rather than taking smaller territories very securely, the game would be decided on which player can improve fastest at the endgame. Take the time to look at each move, particularly to consider whether you'll end up keeping the initiative or not. 

Good luck and keep at it!
