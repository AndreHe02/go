C[I don't really know what I should have changed in my way of playing (generally speaking) to win that game ! The result is close and I don't see real bad move ?
thx];B[pd];W[dp]C[hello];B[dd];W[po];B[oq]LB[pq:A][qq:B]C[Comment: This is a rare move.In this situation,black would usually play at A or B.For me,I would play A]
;W[pq];B[op]LB[pr:A][qq:C][nq:D]C[Comment: Black may consider to play A,then white plays 8,black plays C or D]
;W[pp]C[Comment: After white connects, the two stones of black are too close to the thickness]
;B[lp]LB[jq:A]C[Comment: The shape of black seems very heavy. Black can consider to play A and abandon the two stones if necessary.]

(;W[jq];B[fq];W[jo];B[kq];W[iq]LB[jr:A]C[Comment: it's better for white to play A, keep pressuring the bottom black group]
;B[ln]
(;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn];W[jm];B[co]C[Comment: This is a overplay. Black is too weak outside, and balck cannot just give up this stone either, white will get a lot of territory.]
;W[do];B[cq];W[er];B[cp];W[cn]C[Commet: The corner had some aji, but now,it's a secured terriytory now.]
;B[fl];W[bn]LB[cl:A]C[Comment: I think A might be better, white cannot let the corner be sealed by black]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[bl];B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[bj]LB[di:A]C[Comment: This move is kind of meaningless, there is no way for black to separate white, white can play A instead]

[qg:B][jc:C]C[Comment: Even though this is not a bad move, but it's kind of too passive in cut situation. black is behind in territory now, black needs to find a way to keep territory in balance, so I might play at A, B , or C]

C[Comment: This is a very bad move, black secured the corner after this exchange, and white lost the sente and the chance to play A also]
;B[cg];W[ch];B[bf];W[bh];B[ff]C[Comment: There is no specific purpose for this move. the 4 white stones are top are not weak. black needs to expand the moyo at right hand side now.]

(;W[of]LB[qd:A]C[Comment: White may want to play A first and see how black answer]
;B[rd];W[mf];B[ld]C[Comment: white didn't gain anything and black secured another corner]

;W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[id];W[hd];B[if];W[hb];B[oh];W[jj]C[Comment: From this point of view, white's 133 and black's 152 exchange were not unnecessary.]
