AB[pd][dp]C[Thank you for your help. I played with the black stones.

Hi, I'll try to do my best.];W[dd];B[pq];W[pj];B[cf];W[fd];B[ch]
;W[jq];B[hq]C[So far so good, but with both C14 and now h3 your q3 stone is being a little bit isolated. Time to defend]
;W[nq]C[Too long. N3 would be better for white, now M3 is a good target for black.]
;B[ql]C[Too long. Instead of one solid group - a base to attack from - you've two stones... let's see.

You're quite aggresive, aren't you? :-)];W[qk]C[Is this the right answer?

No, not at all. This move induces q8, wich makes black stronger, and white need another move to stabilize.]
;B[pl]C[Correct!];W[kd]C[This move is big, but now you could easily attack  the q10 group, for example, playing r13. Don't forget your (now lesser) weakeness in the lower rigth.]

(;B[lc]C[Why don't attack the q10 group? You can do it while making territory, one of go's best strategy.  Look at var.

Also, avoid the urge to answer every opponent's move. Sometimes it's better just to play away  (tenuki)]
;W[kc];B[ld]C[After this sequence it is white who has made the best part.]
;W[le];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[qc]C[Or better C6?

It's difficult to say. Anyhow, this 3-3 invasion is quite right now, and white retains the sente (initiative). The only problem is his q10 group, he'll damage it]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
;B[qf];W[qh]C[Ah, now white has induced problems in his isolated group.  Again you could make a lot of profit by chasing it.]
;B[cc]C[San-san envy? :-)];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]C[Not bad, but you'd better played away.

One of the misterys of go, IMHO, is to learn to left risks behind (sometimes!) making a bigger move somewhere else.

Bigger moves now: c8, making a double-wing, P12, attacking...]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[Again, very aggresive, not necessarily bad, but now white can take the corner. From this side, i'd prefer one line up, c9, to make a solid connection. Now there's c10 open to invasion.]
;W[bl]C[I think, this was a mistake. Better B4?

Maybe he plans to expand a little bit before going to the corner. I won't say this is bad...]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[dn];W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[dq];W[cq]C[I had a lot of luck to survive, or?]
;B[cr]C[While not bad, I'd left this unplayed. Now you can expand attacking k3-o3, or r9]
;W[br];B[ds]C[This is one of the situations, I do not know what to play.

In the upper part? J13? (Now this seems to be the best alternative for me.)

Or extend from group R10?

Or the move I played?

I won't have played d1, but after c2 it makes sense. Anyhow, J13 seems a little bit far fetched. The upper left moyo of white is the biggest, and need to be reduced, but i''d play something like f14 to avoid losing the control.]
;W[nn];B[nl];W[ol]C[A mistake !?

I believe so.];B[om];W[ok];B[nm];W[rl];B[rm];W[rj];B[sl];W[rk]
;B[pm]C[You don't need this until he plays q9!];W[sk];B[sm]
;W[qg];B[pg]C[He'll make life behind (to the rigth). He's almost alive already...]
;W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[ng]C[He had to take the stone. Am I right?

Yes, but why didn't you q12, to cut him away..?? Or easier, just take q14?
It's you who should be attaking him, your group is (was?) strong]
;W[ph];B[pe];W[pg];B[mh];W[rf];B[qe]C[This is a 4 point's move, I'd rather defend at o15. He's alive already]
;W[oe]C[Problems...];B[nd];W[se];B[od];W[nf]C[Is there a possibility to catch this stone-mass?

Difficult, now, your group had a lot of weaknesses.];B[nh];W[ni]
;B[mi];W[nj];B[mj];W[lg];B[mg];W[hf]C[I try to make territory in the upper part and in the middle. Not very efficient, I think.

Yes :-)  After a local battle, it's time to look the whole board to find the best next move. Now you're very strong in the lower part, why don't you attack the 3 white stones? Don't forget to make territory while attacking!]
;B[hh]C[It'll be difficult to make big territory in the middle, more even if the 3 white stones below scape. Anyhow, it's not a bad idea to limit the expansion of the white moyo.]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[eh];B[ei];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[hi];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[ff];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[kj];W[ij]C[All the next moves I was afraid of K12. The cut was a mistake.

Better K12 and later K6?

I don't understand, you speak as if you were playing white. Why afraid of k12?]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[gi];W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[im];W[hp]C[Ok, ok, the 3 white stones are surrounded, and he's started to defend them. I'd try an all-or-nothing attack, maybe m3.]

;W[qn];B[qm];W[po];B[oo];W[no];B[pn];W[np];B[qo];W[kh]C[I believe you're now sligthly behind, but nothing a good endgame cannot solve.]

;B[ln];W[lo];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[kb]
(;B[lb]C[This is quite small! Now it's of paramount importance to keep sente and make the moves in the best order.

Look at var to see a sequence where you keep sente and play in a (more or less) correct order]
