C[Hi reviewer.
I took white in this game and won by 2.5 points.
It was an interesting game for me because looking back on it there aren't any obvious mistakes (that I can see except D11 area)
 
Therefore the mistakes that you can point out will be twice as valuable to me as they are mistakes I don't know I'm making.

Also general comments on where I should be spending my time to improve will be greatly appreciated. I'll be working hard on go over the summer :D

Thanks for taking time to help me! :)

C[MR: I would not choose this pincer here. Instead, M17 or Q14 seem to be "normal".]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kb];B[ng];W[nq]C[MR: Good. As far as I know, there is no good and urgent continuation on the top for white.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[jq];B[mo]C[I was unsure how to answer this. I figured calmly defending probably forced black to go back and protect the cut so I could get the oba at D10. This worked in the game but was it correct thinking?]
;W[lp];B[qn]C[MR:This move feels also strange after N5 for M4. I would have expected that black continues building a moyo around L6 ...]
;W[dj]C[MR: Good.];B[lf];W[kc];B[jd];W[kj]C[MR: Personally, I would have preferred to play at C16. Your move limits the scope of the black moyo, but also invites fighting. If black manages to chase your stone at L10, he will get some black stones in the middle area, which will make it much easier for him to invade the white framework on the left.]
;B[cd];W[df];B[bf];W[cc]C[MR: In my opinion, the is a questionable move. Where do you want to take territory? In the corner? If so, you should have played L10 on C16 or C17 instead. Now the corner seems to be rather small because of K16.]
;B[bc];W[dd];B[ce];W[bb];B[bd]C[MR: Now you got a wall with D16, D14, but you cannot build territory with it because of K16 etc. I think that your strategy starting from C17 failed.]
;W[mg]C[Too early? Maybe now was the time to play D3?];B[mf]
;W[nf];B[nh];W[lg];B[kg];W[lh];B[kh];W[li];B[md];W[nd];B[mj]
C[MR: Wrong direction.];W[kl];B[ml];W[kn]C[MR: Ok, now you at least got a wall that fits with your moyo on the left side ...]
;B[ih];W[ic]C[MR: Again, what is your goal? Build territory on the top? In my opinion, this move is too small. I would use it to extend my moyo at the bottom left or to turn part of it into territory (J10 or C5 would be some ideas).]
;B[id];W[hc];B[hi]C[MR: Now the black group in the center is rather strong. So your cutting strategy with N13 etc. did not work out well - you got 10 extra points on the top, but your moyo on the bottom left feels weak with living black groups in the center and on the top left.]
;W[dq]C[I feel lucky I got to play this. But looking now I am not sure wether C4 is better?
MR: I would have played C5 if I had played in this area. The reason is that for black invading on the left side is easier that invading in the bottom, because from the left side he has two options to connect - to his middle group or to his left side group.]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[cm]C[MR: This invastion is difficult to handle for white ...]
;W[em];B[en]C[MR: This black move rather strengthens white and allows him to close the corner and to take part of the bottom as territory.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[cn];B[cj];W[el];B[ck];W[cg]C[MR: Seems strange to me as it strengthens black and helps him to connect.]
;B[bg];W[hk]C[MR: Good idea to turn the bottom left into white territory.]

;B[on];W[ln]C[I was happy I found this sequence but I am not sure it was played in the correct order. Was it? Or was there even a better one?]
;B[qb];W[op]C[This looks ugly now - I played it to make Q2 sente but then though N17 more important. Even if not locally Q2 is better first right?]

;B[os];W[mr];B[ms];W[ls];B[ns];W[nr];B[ps];W[lr]C[MR: It seems that black gets nearly all large endgame sequences - R18, top left cornder, Q2 etc. You only caught two stones M7 etc. in the center. 

So I think that watching out for large endgame sequences at the edges of the board would be an idea to focus on in your next games.]

MR: Matthew, from the game I think that there are two main areas where you could focus on in your next games

1) Strategic decisions in the (early) middle game (this is in my opinion the most difficult part of the game): You made some very good decisions (e.g. the fuseki, turning the bottom left corner into territory, turning the whole bottom left quarter into white territory etc.), but there were also areas where I had the feeling that you did not ask yourself "what do I want to attempt" resp. "where do I want to get territory / influence after this sequence" prior to the start of the sequence. Examples are the black invastion on the top left side and the handling of the fight with the black middle group.

2) Large endgame sequences at the edges of the board: Black got mainly all large endgame sequences at the edges. This is a topic that is rather easy for you to turn your attention to - this will give you some 10 points plus in your games :-)]
