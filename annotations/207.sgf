;B[oc];W[cp];B[pq];W[qd];B[qg];W[pe];B[lc]C[Usually one does not pincer at R13 if t's going to extend at the top, trying to play
at both sides it's a bit greedy.];W[nd];B[nc];W[pc]C[Forcing with O16 to build thikness to attack the black stone at R13
seems resonable, but then shifting to to Q17 is contradictory, and ...]

(;B[md]C[... although N16 is obviously a vital point to protect, P16 is a still more
vital point, so black should have take the oporunity to strike now, showing
white the inconsistency of the last two moves (see variation).]
;W[dd];B[eq];W[dn];B[hp];W[po];B[oo]C[Instead of making a moyo at the lower side, playing Q9 that is
pincer plus extension is another possibility.];W[on];B[op];W[pm]
;B[kq]C[I think black coul play higher here.
Or still R10 or Q10. As black has not played R5
to take the corner, at least R10 would give him
S7 as a follow up if white plays first at the corner.];W[cj]
C[Black has neither played R5 nor R/Q10, so white should do
something now: first pincer R13 stone seeking sente to play R3 then.
C10 is a big point, but not so urgent because white can still atach at
D3 in the corner.];B[fc]C[Again a good point, but I think that the right side is more urgent.]

(;W[hc]C[Beeing black so strong at the upper right it does'nt look as
a good idea to pincer.
More normal would be the variation.];B[fe];W[df];B[id];W[db]
;B[eb];W[fg];B[hd];W[qi]C[White gets F13 and the atack on the right, but black's
territory is 1 line higher and not having answered E18
leaves lots of aji in the corner];B[qk]C[Very interesting move. While simply jumping to P13 would threaten
to enclose white in the corner, which also looks interesting for black,
this aproach makes thinks a lot more difficult for both: for white to
get something in return from the attack if both stones survive, for black
to get compensation if finally one of the stones has to be sacrificed.]
;W[oi]C[The drawback of the jump at P11 is that black is left with the atachement
at S11. It can be played even right now.];B[ok];W[pg];B[ri]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[rg];B[qj];W[mn]C[White has not gained many points capturing R13, neither will
make many at the lower right, while the black stones look almost
settled. I think that black come out slightly better from the fight.]
;B[qf]C[Decing now between R14 or S14 looks premature.];W[rf]
;B[mk]C[Instead of jumping,  S7 that affects both groups base is
more interesting: making (and stealing) points while attacking.]
;W[qn]C[Undeniably steady, but I think white can play R3 now and get most
of the corner points away from black.];B[rm]C[Instead of S7, now that N9 is already in place, S4 is far
biger in term of points.];W[rn]C[After R6 white can answer this way.]
;B[rl];W[qq]C[And finally get R3. Having played N6 and R3 is a big boost for
white on the right.];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]C[Instead of S2 maybe M5 or M4 are better.]
;W[mp]C[Even assuming that the black stones in the corner are alive is difficult
to find a good way to resist white here.];B[mq];W[nq];B[np]
;W[no];B[oq];W[lq];B[mr];W[kp];B[lr];W[lp];B[jq]C[This is terrible for black.
White is ahead.];W[fl]C[Strange looking move. It doesn't mean it's bad.
But the continuation makes it look bad.
Probably just playing C17 is better.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[cd]
;B[da];W[ec];B[fb];W[bc];B[bb];W[go]C[Even if we assume later white can connect at B16 and black plays A18,
the difference with white protecting the corner instead of F8 would
be of 14 points, if it's black that captures at B16,  it's over 20 points.
Was F8 worth 20 points ?
G5 and the following will make it look even stranger.];B[ho]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[hq];B[fq];W[hn];B[jo];W[nl];B[oj];W[hl]C[White could, instead of F8, played this same sequence, maybe
changing H8 to G7 for safety reason, and G8 is unnecesary; if
black takes the corner now, white can play at H10 or H11.
Changing F8 and H8 positions like this makes a big difference!]
;B[cr]C[Enormous!!
A white move at D2 would ensure white of  about 10 points, while if white
doesn't want to end in gote ...];W[hg]C[... so playing at the other big point ...]
;B[bq]C[... not only white has lost 10 pints in the corner, black has now
7 points more than if black had played D2, for a grand  total of
about 17 points.
This makes a difference of more than 35 points in the corners.
Of course white has gained points in the center while denying
black the possibility of making anything big  there, but black  keeps sente. So I think oaverall black gained here. The game gets closer.]
;W[bp];B[gh];W[gg];B[ii]C[Would F8 and H8 have been played as comented, black
could not reduce this way.];W[hi];B[hj];W[gj];B[hh];W[gi];B[ig]
;W[fh];B[ih];W[ij]C[Small, N12 of O11 look better.];B[ng];W[oh]
;B[mi]C[Beacause of the aji at the right and the forcing moves at the center
toward the left black is able of making some points in the center.
Now the game is again very close.];W[jj];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[ne]
;B[me];W[nf];B[mf];W[pb]C[This and B16 are the bigger points remaining on the board. For white
to connect is almost sente as then A18 would be 4 (actually 5) more  points in sente. But Q8 threatening O19 in sente is about the same
size.];B[oa];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa];B[bd]C[Good decision, even if finally black has to allow white to
play O19 in sente.];W[be];B[ac];W[na];B[mb];W[in];B[jp];W[sh]

C[White still have 2 outside liberties, there's no need to protect now.
Sente is all important in such a close game.];B[do];W[cn];B[of]
;W[oe];B[og];W[pf];B[rq]C[Not so big as white will prove immediately.
But big enough to win.];W[ge];B[gd];W[if];B[jf];W[ff];B[fd]
;W[ie];B[je];W[jh];B[jg];W[he]C[White regained the tempo losed by playing at D13 too
early.  It'll be a half-point, but I don't know which is
the optimal play in the center now.
 Actually playing now S4 for black, that threatens S5 and
connection is pretty big, but then maybe white is able to
make enough points in the center despite the eyes problems
with the sotnes at the rigth ...];B[km];W[rp];B[ml];W[ln];B[nm]

White can atack the right side now or ...];W[hd];B[hc];W[fd]

(;B[od];W[oe];B[qj]C[Now black has efectively played on both sides, even if white builds up
more thickness in the center protecting the O15 cut it will be of small
use and Q16 remains, so the corner will be pretty small as black  S13, S14
and S15 all trhee threaten things.]))
