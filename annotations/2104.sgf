C[benjamin: I am a new player, have been playing online for a month. My opponent was also fairly new, though more experienced than me I think. Playing black in this game.

I am looking to understand from your review the most basic errors in my game, what should I do differently?

Thanks for your time.

PNH: You will improve quickly if you avoid contact play and catastrophes that can result from it, especially in the opening, (except when trying to make eyes)

Also be aware of the strength of your walls and play away from them to make profit.

Happy playing.];B[dp];W[dd];B[pp];W[qd];B[oc];W[pb];B[df];W[gc]
;B[jd]LB[nb:B][jc:A]SQ[ob][oc]C[PNH: Playing lower (at A) would have been better. You shouldn't give your opponent the opportunity to slip under your positions and rob you of points and a base (to make eyes) on the border.

White is now in a position to slip easily at K17 and O18.

This would also have been a reason to follow up your play at P17 with a play at P18 earlier.]
;W[pg];B[mc];W[ob];B[nb]C[PNH: Good.];W[ic];B[id]SQ[jc]C[PNH: Much better to block at K17 here. The border is much more important than the center at this stage early in the game.]
;W[jc];B[kc]C[PNH: Good.];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mb]TR[be][pe]
[cj][pj][jq]C[PNH: That's useless. Only worth one point maybe. Any of the marked points (with triangles) would be worth much more. In the opening you must first secure the corners and then the borders before answering any threat that is not very serious.]

C[PNH: The space it too tight for black to live in this corner.]
;W[fa]C[PNH: But white blundered. He should have connected at G18.]
;B[gb];W[da]C[benjamin: white wouldn't give up here, was there a way I could have killed this white group at F18 more effectively?

PNH: Yes. See variation.]
(;B[bb];W[hb];B[ha];W[be];B[ia];W[jb];B[dj]TR[cd][dd][be][ee]
[fe][ge]SQ[bg][ci]C[PNH: I prefer something like B13 to prevent white from slipping under, although it is risky to play close to a strong wall. So you could have played C11 as well.]
;W[fq];B[fp]TR[cn]SQ[dj][dp]C[PNH: That's playable. Your marked stones (with squares) work well together. You could also consider C6.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[eq];W[dr];B[cp]SQ[dj][dp][fp][cq][eq]C[PNH: Very good. You now have a wall that works very well with D10.]
;W[er];B[gq]SQ[ep]C[PNH: This creates a weakness in your position. I would rather block at E4.]
;W[fr]C[benjamin: Again I had trouble keeping this group at E2 from spreading along the bottom...

PNH: That's not a problem as long as white creeps along the second line. 

In Go the third line is called the line of territory.

The fourth line is the line of victory...

...and the second line is the line of defeat.

This is because running along the side on the second line makes only one point of territory for each contiguous stone laid down. This is not worth the influence the other player gets while constructing a wall on the outside.]

;W[fg];B[gg]SQ[eh]C[PNH: Better to avoid contact in fight.]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi]SQ[df]C[PNH: Contact strengthens both players but as you can see, your stone at D14 feels lonely now.]
;W[dh];B[fj];W[ie];B[he]TR[mb][nb][kc][lc][mc][oc]SQ[je][kf]
