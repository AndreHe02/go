AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,

When I was playing this game,after 30-40 moves, I thought, that I can't win it. And I was very surprised when the score showed, that I won by 9,5 point.
I would be very greatful if you could show me what allowed me to win the game. I think that the ko gave me this chance, I played it  on purpose, because I've never played ko before seriously.
This was my first game on 3 stones, so I didn't know, how to play that too.

Thaks for review.
Paul

==================

Hello Paul ^__^

Basically, we win a game because our opponents make more mistakes than we do. Therefore, in this review, i will show you where/what are your mistakes.

KO fighting is a difficult issue! even for a dan player. So, if possible, i would suggest you to avoid playing it. What you should focus is the fundamental of go.

Hope it helps
Jane

=================

Hey Jane and Paul,

Just a different view on the opening and early fighting that went on.  I am sure this will offer some futher insight on how to use the handicap stones.

I added some objective views to some of janes review.

I must say, in the endgame, with the mistakes that white made, that is why black won the game.  There were a few areas that jane did touch on that would have changed the outcome of this game in favour of white.

Overall, this game well well played and well reviewed.

--allfather];W[cd]LB[ec:B][ed:A][cj:C][jj:F][pj:E][jp:D]C[Jane:

The concept of a handicap game is for black to stress on building up influence and playing a fighting game as black's already had more stones on the board. So the key is to attack (not kill) white. Keep white groups seperated and make them live as small as possible. 

Normally, b approaches at A or B is natural. I will show you some simple josekis here.

Allfather:

good analysis

B/A are great for attacking on the 1st move, as a handicap game is supposed to teach us.  Taking a large move at E-F is not bad either.  Tengen will be very helpful later on.

D and E are MIAI]
(;B[cj]LB[pj:A][jp:B]C[Maybe better move would be Q19 or K4.

Jane:

I don't understand Q19.. i think probably you mean Q10 and K4. Both are ok and better than C10.

Allfather:

Turning the lower handicap games into a higher handicap games is a great thing to do.  In this situation  K4 and Q10 are miai.]
;W[ec]LB[pj:B][jp:A]
(;B[pj]C[Jane:

Q10 is ok. IMO, K4 is a bit better. It works together with C10

Allfather: 

This would be better, as the influence is all black now.];W[jq]
LB[hq:B][lq:A]C[A and B are almost miai.  With the white stones in the top left, they can be used to fuel at attack on c10.

H3 would be the better stone to attack from.  

When attacking it is often better to drive your opponent into your influence.]

(;B[hq]C[I decided to attack him from left, because this group looked weaker. But maybe I should attack from right side?

Jane:

I would prefer attack from the right side]
(;W[mq]LB[pn:C][ho:A][oq:B]C[C would be best.]
(;B[nq]C[Jane:

Don't attach against a weak stone!

Contact plays will help the opponent to strenghten himself.

Allfather:

Agreed.];W[mp];B[mr];W[lr];B[or]C[Jane:

This is ok. BUT w group became stronger. W can think of attacking b H3

Allfather:

a living group is always good to have, how will you attack with this?]

(;W[nc]LB[lc:B][pf:A]C[Jane:

Black at A is good. It works fine with your moyo.

Here I will show you another idea by attacking w at B]
(;B[pf];W[jd]LB[hd:D][ld:A][cg:C][io:B]C[Allfather:

There are many good moves on the board for black now.  

A: directly agressive and attacks whites influence.

B: is a great attack on an already weaked white group, this will make your opponent run, while you get more territory.

C: is purely territory, and will then aim at the invastion at D.]
;B[cg]C[Allfather:

Great move.];W[dm]LB[cm:A]C[As long as your stones are alive, they do not ALWAYS have to stay connected.]

(;B[cm]C[I tried to keep my stones connected, but it didn't work.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cl]LB[bm:A][co:B]C[Allfather:

A: would show how to keep life and territory while causing most damage to your opponent.]

(;B[co]C[Jane:

This move looks ok here.

Allfather: 

I disagree.  Best to not give your oppoentn life, when you are done with the variation, you can attack his weak groups and make life/territory.]

(;B[ol];W[om]
(;B[jp]C[Jane:

Bad move. White is stronger there. So again what you should do is attacking D8 group.
