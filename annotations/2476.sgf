C[Hello, I am White in this game against another 3k on igs server. I have written down my thoughts on many places during the game and I would very much appreciate if you could point out where I played bad moves or had the wrong thoughts about how to approch the situation.

Thank you very much for taking the time to review this game for me! :)

-Henrik

I tried to make the commentary so you can read through the main line of the game without looking at all the variations. The variations are provided to illustrate the points I try to make with the comments. So don't get hung up in studying the variations too deeply if you think it is tiring, I know there are a lot of them and some are very long...

- Morten];B[pp];W[dp];B[pe];W[cc];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[cn]
(;B[dr]C[This is a bad move, because after the normal joseki there should be the possibility of invading on the 3-3 point - I will show the normal variation to explain:]
;W[cq];B[cr]
(;W[lq]LB[jq:A]C[this move leaves a glaring weakness at A. I think it is better to hold back to L3 or play B2.]

(;B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[el];B[cm];W[dn];B[ch];W[fn];B[go];W[jp]
C[This might be slow, i just thought that I would make that group a little stronger in order to not get problems with it after G5.

This is the correct move - after this you have both R6 and B2]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[dq];W[cp];B[aq]
(;W[pc]C[I figured I would manage to live in lower left anyway, so went to prevent a shimari here

This is a big move, but R6 is bigger -- if he ignores you now and plays R6 the M3 strength goes partly to waste...]

(;B[nd];W[nc]
(;B[od]C[this move is bad];W[mc]C[I dont know how any joseki here would go, but wanted to go out since he didnt play N17

This is absolutely right - P16 is a big mistake by B];B[oc]
;W[ob];B[dd];W[cd];B[de];W[eb]
(;B[fc]C[this move is not joseki and for good reason...];W[ec]
;B[fd];W[ed]C[cutting here is too early.. explanation follows in next comment]
;B[ee];W[fe]C[This cut mainly to see how he responds and see if I can get an attack on one of the groups

It is very dangerous to create a new group (the cutting stones will have to run to live) when you are not alive in the lower left. You should not initiate this cutting sequence before you are thick across the board. The best strategy seems to me to play in such a way that B ends up spending a move to connect on a dame point.]
;B[hd];W[ce]C[Partly to secure corner, and was meant to pressure D16 to an extent too]
;B[cf]
(;W[df]C[this is a bad move, you should play F14 to keep the F17 group weak.]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[cg];W[eh]
(;B[fg]TR[df][dg][eh]C[now your cutting stones are cutting two alive groups, so they are just a big burden for you. Also, B had a better alternative for this move.]
;W[ej]C[I couldnt find any good moves to attack blacks left side from this position so went for a connection with my other group

if you created a cutting group and end up having to spend a move just to connect it while your opponent lives easily on both sides, the cut was bad. Usually you should only cut when your opponent has weak groups on _both_ sides on your cutting stones - if only one side is weak it's likely your cutting group will be in as much trouble as his weak group.]
;B[ek];W[cj]C[this is a really nice move!];B[dj];W[di];B[ci]
;W[fk];B[ck];W[fj];B[gf]TR[fg]C[you can clearly see now that F13 has become a wasted move...]

(;W[qd]C[I thought Black R17 would be a little too painful for me, so i played this with the intention to make something on the right side after his response

Normally strengthening the opponent like this is bad. I provide a variation where you leave this exchange unplayed and just directly play the splitting move - you can judge for yourself...]
;B[qe];W[qk];B[qi];W[qn]C[R6 is an excellent point!];B[qo];W[pn]
;B[nq];W[qq]C[This is just test his response, but it might have been bad if he had responded at S5?

If there is really only one answer it cannot be called a probe...]

(;B[qp];W[oj]C[Im not sure if i like this move of mine, but just wanted to see if it would be able to do something with his right side group

It's a good move];B[rq]C[This is a bad move from black at this point?

if he doesn't play here, you can live in the corner. If you live in the corner after you strengthened with P10, his corner group might die. So it cannot be helped - it only shows what a terrible move R4 was.]
;W[nr]
(;B[mr]C[this move is not good, since you get to close the center]
;W[mq];B[or];W[np];B[oq];W[oo]C[I was happy that he let me seal him in here

you should be ^_^];B[kc];W[ld]C[Another move to prepare for attack on right side

This is a bad move because of the cutting sequence in the game. See next comment.]
;B[pb];W[qb]C[I didnt mind being cut here. i thought i had to do something since i didnt have much territory so mad corner safe and let him cut so that I could jump out and try to take advantage of his right sides weakness

I don't agree at all - you having a running group will _help_ him settle his right side. You have the same amounts of secure territory, but your center can be expanded a lot.

By the way, maybe you see the value of playing R16 at R18 now?]
;B[nb];W[pa];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kd];B[jc];W[lg]C[I wanted to attack the side now, but wouldnt do it too directly now that m16 is so weak.

exactly - so getting cut was very bad for you, closing the center is now next to impossible.]

(;B[mi]C[I was happy with this move since it would let me try to attack by seperating that move from his group

your bad moves turn out good after he fails to deal with your (inevitable) counterattack. He should play N11 one space to the right, that way you cannot counterattack so easily.]
;W[og]C[this is a very good counterattack... The fight here is very difficult, I spent a long time to research it. I will give a few variations:]

(;B[ph]C[this move is very bad - it does not take advantage of the thinness of the two W two-space jumps at all, but in fact removes the thinness completely.]
;W[oh];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[nj]C[Im also happy with this, but of course my moves may be very bad, please tell me if so :)

his moves were bad - now his side is weak, your stones are strong and the center is closed, a complete reversal of fortunes...]
;B[nk];W[pg]C[Now i move in for the attack

this is a little impatient. you should move N10 to make yourself completely safe first.]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[ri];W[qh];B[pi];W[qf];B[rg];W[rf];B[sh]
(;W[rj]LB[re:B][oi:A]C[I didnt want that group to live, even if this might be risky for my corner and or center stones

Do you want to kill this group or win the game? only by making yourself safe here can you collect the win. Now there is bad aji both at A and B, so it's to be expected that he can pull off something.]
;B[re];W[pf];B[sf]C[I didnt mind that connection

this connection gives him many possibilities for making trouble..]
;W[pd]C[I thought this move might my corner a little safer if he jumped in there

the bad aji lies in the P11 cut, not here -- at this point he could completely destroy you by playing P11 as shown in the variation.]

(;B[oe];W[mj]C[to prevent Black p11

playing P11 would be safer -- see the variations]
(;B[rc];W[rd];B[rb];W[sd];B[ra]C[I was very uncertain here, but went for a cut, thinking I might kill his outside stones before he could destroy my corner]

(;W[se]
(;B[sg]C[He should have taken the KO here right?

connecting means certain death, yes...];W[of];B[mo]C[Seems he gave up top/left groups now, i didnt mind that move of his, thinking i would get a target to attack

again you seem to underestimate the value of the safety you get by being connected]

(;W[mm]C[I thought his cut wouldnt be too bad so instead wanted to prepare to attack his stones while reducing the chances of O9 group getting anything done. I dont think this move is any goodnow though]
;B[mp];W[lr]C[I wanted to make lower group as safe as i could before attacking]
;B[ns]
(;W[nn]C[I wanted to pretect a little more before attack since my right side isnt too strong (i think so at least...) and his group still has a lot to do to be safe.

your weakness lies to the left (as you found out...) so this is the wrong direction.]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[kp];W[kq]C[Is this move ok

yes, you want to remove a liberty so K3 seems too soft (and also leaves L2 tesuji)]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[km]
(;W[jr]C[I didnt really like my L3 move, in case white m1 etc, so went for further security since I have the lead. It seems like a bad move to me though

this move is definitly too slow - if you run out, your group should make life by connecting while killing B.]
;B[jn]C[now you can no longer kill B here -- only by realizing this can you safely collect the win.]

(;W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[gn]C[Now i misread

.. but you still did not have any better move than protecting the F8 cutting point]

(;W[gl]C[Now I misread, because I thought i could cut after black h7

if you don't protect this cutting point you will get in big trouble]
;B[hm];W[hp]C[But of course I couldnt, i didnt see that, sloppy of me.]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[dm];W[em]C[I didnt want to play this move, but I had very short time, I thought i should play E6 instead, but wanted to be safe since i was in a hurry

this removes a liberty, so it is probably better];B[eo];W[en]
C[I didnt like this and see that my group might be in danger now]
;B[gi];W[ap];B[bs];W[bm]C[To make a little room for an eye or two]
;B[bj];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[gj]C[Now I have eye (I think)

yes, but you can already live by B5, so if he reduces you to one eye there, _then_ you can play this move to make the other... in fact you could already tenuki]
;B[ii];W[li]C[That move was of course bad, I was getting too sure of victory here i think.. The eye I just made disappeared

you're still alive, and you've removed all chances of P11 ever working -- I think it's good.]
;B[hk]
(;W[hl];B[hj];W[il]C[I plyed that move because I thought It needed a reply and might help me that he couldnt capture those stones right away

but now he destroyed your eye with sente, so you are in trouble! you should play differently at move 170.]

(;B[bl]C[I was happy that he didnt play k8 here

you could still live];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[kn]C[his moves here were bad I think

yes, he's dead ...];W[kk];B[lk]C[And then Im safe];W[kj];B[ml]
C[I Saw that i might be able to capture more so I didnt want to defend if I instead could kill his group and at the same time reinforce my weak right side

I think it would be more prudent to capture the two stones and hope he can't kill you on the right...]

(;W[om]C[I Saw that i might be able to capture more so I didnt want to defend if I instead could kill his group and at the same time reinforce my weak right side]
;B[ji]
(;W[mn]C[Wanted to take his eye

This move almost lost you the game... if he plays M10 now it's over.]

(;B[rl];W[rm];B[rk];W[qj];B[pl];W[ql];B[sj];W[qm];B[sk];W[ol]
C[I didnt feel to sure here

I don't think he had a way to kill you, you have S5 or O8.. and after you got P8 his M10 move doesn't work]

(;B[nl];W[ro];B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[no]C[Needed that second eye

now he can never win the semeai with your big group -- you have at least 7 liberties, he has no more than 5.]
;B[dh]C[I didnt want to gamble at all there, i had bad time again, so just sacrificed those stones

you can also start reducing liberties with M4 directly...];W[bn]

Again, thank you very much taking the time to do this for me! :)

-Henrik

You are welcome -- I think your biggest mistakes lie in picking bad fights, you need to be more scared of the opponent and be aware that creating a new group always carries a big cost as either it has to make life or you will have to sacrifice it. Good luck with your Go, I hope to see you at the Norwegian Championship in the fall ^_^
