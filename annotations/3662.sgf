C[Hello,

my name is Helmut, I am MaiTai on IGS and still trying to determine my rank. I play black in this game.

This game was very close with some obvous mistakes on both sides (don't be misled by the score - my opponent overlooked a big atari near the end)

I would be very interested in comments about bad habits / bad strategy / systematic weaknesses, but especially on how I lost the large area on the top side I already had walled in (move 79 ..)

my comments have <**H**:>

thank you very much for taking the time!

Helmut

W:Hi, My name is Irfan, nice to meet u.. I am a high school student and i am from Indonesia, so i am sorry if my english is bad.

W:My comment is starting with "W:" signing my user name in KGS, "Waton".]

;W[ro]
(;B[ck]C[**H**: I did not _KNOW_ the LR corner could live but I felt it was safe enough so I could take a big point. maybe later attack C14 by an extension

W: Corner is safe, but i think some pressure for white C14 is better for tennuki now]
;W[nr];B[or]

(;B[eh]TR[db][eb][fb]C[**H**: I was indeed worried about the open belly around E18 but decided to reinforce the wall instead

W: Yes, your idea absolutely better than close some territory above, but maybe E11 is little better because it`s terminate white aji`s]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[fb];B[gc];W[qf]
(;B[md]TR[pf]C[**H**: build an extension for my wall.

maybe the attachment at Q14 would have been even better? but I was worried about all the open space and feared a white invasion of the top side


W: Joseki is Q14, but ur move is okay..]
(;W[rd]C[W: I think black invasion in right side now is perfect timing]

(;W[qi]C[W: bad];B[pj];W[ql];B[po]C[**H**: I am not happy with this move. I even knew that Q5 could be captured in a net.


W:  so, why? lol ^^.];W[pn];B[oo];W[nn];B[pi];W[qh]
(;B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[nj];B[ni];W[oj]
(;B[oi];W[mi];B[mj]C[**H**: this is where bad things start to happen. the cutting stones get into trouble and my territory (?) at the top gets devastated.

I thought W N11 could not live with all the black walls left and right and my N10 would make life somehow in the open space. boy was I wrong.

on the other hand: to let white wall off the lower side is out of the question. pls advise on what to do and why in this situation.]

(;B[lj]C[W: this is fighting shape.];W[kj]
(;B[ll];W[nk];B[ml];W[ji]
(;B[fq]MA[hq]C[**H**: probably better at H3 but I thought stay away from thickness (wall O1-4). actually I was expecting a pincer and to live in the corner starting with C3 (not a great strategy now that I think of it)

W: F3 is ok locally.. But why u ignore ur M10 now? with white`s L10 group that still weak, black can help M10 first in sente]

(;W[km]
(;B[mn]C[W: You must commit to your previous move, now u don`t need to try to help M10 since u ignore it before.]

(;W[mo];B[ln];W[kn];B[kl];W[jl];B[lo];W[ko];B[iq]C[**H**: at least make a base and take some territory. M8 and company are a lost cause. or aren't they?

W: you can make base from 4 move ago, so it`s cost less prisoners]
;W[kq];B[io];W[eq];B[fp];W[fr];B[gr]C[W: Let`s do some count...
White: UL=16, UR=14, BL=18, around N7=42

potential territory in center is about 30pt

black is back in the game..];B[ho]C[W: too small];W[lp];B[jg]

W: it`s okay, the center is hard to make point, remember?];W[lf]

(;B[ke]MA[lg]C[**H**: I tried to read a few variations starting with M13 but none worked. would it have been possible to cut off W M14?]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[le];B[ld];W[je]C[**H**: at this point I was confident K15 was an overplay and it would die naturally]

thanks for your time !

W: Sure, Your welcome... this was fun game.

Your weakness here is ussually about looking right time for tenuki, and for invade. and it`s will naturally improved when u are more experiented. so, don`t worry too much.
