Hello,

I played black here. My rank is 7 kyu in Finland. I would to like have some advice about tactics. I have lately started playing white in all kinds of handicap games and it has affected my game so that I feel in even games I overplay a lot like in the large handicap games, and I usually end up with small living groups everywhere. This game is typical example of my recent style. Even thought I won the game I still feel that I am missing something. Also, I feel that I am playing submissive moves.

Thank you,

Teemu (teemu.leppanen@oulu.fi)

The "problem" is that you seem to spend most of your effort on preventing the opponent from getting anything, instead of building anything of your own. This in itself is not necessarily a bad strategy, but the games tend to develop this way then. I didn't think you played particularly submissively, but you might get that feeling because you tend to play a lot in the opponents sphere of influence; and you can't play more aggressively there.
But stronger players usually prefer to get a position that can be developed in the future; a group enclosed in the corner has no further influence on the game; a group that has to make life within the opponent's influence easily get attacked and gives the initiative to the opponent. (That it actually lives doesn't matter.)
You should also pay more attention to the importance of sente in the early stages of the game. It's a huge difference between ending a corner sequence in sente and gote when there are still large opening moves to be made.

  /pem];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[Low chinese opening is my favourite since I have a book about it.]
;W[po];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[no];B[mp]C[This is good for Black. /pem]
;W[pl]
(;B[ql]C[I would prefer to push up at Q9 instead... /pem];W[pk]
;B[pj];W[qm];B[oj]C[...although this is not bad for Black either. White had to continue at P10. /pem]
;W[pf];B[qh]C[This was too early since I have S7? Perhaps O17 or O16 first?

Yes. When White approach high (instead of R14) he can't slide into the corner. Black O16 seems ok. /pem]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc]C[P15 was option here but I didnt want to give white the corner.

Why not? If White tries, Black gets a quite good result. /pem]

(;B[ob]C[This looks odd. Simply connecting at Q17 seems better.]

(;W[nb]
(;B[qd];W[oe];B[rf]C[So I have the corner and my groups connected. But there's K16 for white to play so this doesnt look too good.]
;W[jp]C[A mistake. This is an uninviting area for White to play in, and if he plays here, K3 or L3 is better. K16 ist the big point on the board. /pem]
;B[mo]C[I think this is the correct response? Later I can attack from H4 etc?]
;W[nn]
(;B[hc]C[I didnt want to play closer to the corner so invading would be an option. Perhaps try to double approach the corner by playing F17 first? What other options I have here? H4? I feel I had to prevent white playing here.

Since White failed to play here, Black has to play here now. H17 is probably ok, but I might have gone for J17 instead. /pem]

(;W[id]C[This is a strange move. White wants to attack the Black stone, not strengthen it. /pem]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[jc]C[Perhaps H16 instead of this?

It's possible, but this is ok too. /pem];W[hd];B[gd];W[ge];B[fd]
;W[kc]TR[he][kd]C[This was bad since white has E17.

I don't think so. Black can run into the open with F15 instead. This entire sequence was bad for White, since the black stone at P10 reduces the effect of White's influence, and White has two cutting points to worry about. /pem]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[eb];W[fe];B[cj]C[This seems absolutely necessary because of the white wall and also I wanted to keep it possible to invade C3. Strategically this seems bad since in the top I had to play H17 and now again I have to play against a wall.

Well, if you insist on make life in corners and along the sides instead of getting out into the open, that is what happens. It's not necessarily bad, but it is a natural consequence. /pem]
;W[dl];B[cg];W[ck];B[be];W[ce];B[bf];W[bd];B[cq];W[dj];B[ci]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr]C[I played this joseki in wrong order?

The stones at C9-D8 changes what is joseki and what is not. Better not to worry about joseki and play moves that make sense instead. ;-) /pem]
;W[er];B[bo];W[bn]
(;B[do]C[Another possibility is to play E3 and give up the corner. /pem]
;W[cn];B[cr];W[eq];B[bp];W[ln]C[H4 doesnt work anymore? White could answer H6.]
;B[hm]C[Probably good to reduce White's moyo, but difficult to say where the best point is. This is possibly too deep though. Perhaps J8 is better? /pem]
;W[mk]C[A good response. /pem];B[hj];W[eh]C[I feel I didnt have time to play this move.]
;B[bh];W[ni]C[White is pressing to hard on Black's strength. Better to play H5 for instance. /pem]
;B[ho];W[hp]C[White is playing a contanct move again, when he should be attacking. /pem]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[ip];W[hq];B[jo];W[kp]C[I was lucky here.];B[iq]
;W[kr]C[White should play L5 instead, and keep Black separated. /pem]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[lp];W[ir];B[kq];W[jr];B[jq];W[go];B[gn];W[fo]
;B[ji]C[Anything better? This move caused problems later. What about R4 instead?

R4 is big, but reducing the center is too. K11 seems a little aimless, but nothing seriously wrong with it. It shouldn't cause problems. /pem]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[ij];B[ii];W[il];B[kl]C[I didnt see white L9 here. :-(

Black is ahead at this stage. The only important thing now is to stay connected, so G11 is the only move. /pem]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[gi];W[in];B[im];W[fm];B[gm]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[fk];B[jg]C[How can I be stupid enough not to connect here. The move looked so hamrless. :)

A blatant blunder. Of course Black must answer the peep and connect. /pem]
;W[gk]
(;B[jl]C[Now Black has an eyless group floating in the center. It should to be natural to do something to help it. This move is hardly doing that. /pem]
;W[kj];B[lh];W[nj]C[I think M14 is better. It may still be difficult to kill Black (which White has to do to win), but there is at least hope. /pem]
;B[fh];W[eg];B[ke]C[Any comments about this fight? I felt that if I have time to play H13 or H14 then I would live.

After White O10 it seems difficult to really kill Black. /pem]

;W[me];B[mf];W[le];B[oh];W[nh];B[of]C[Lucky me.];W[pg];B[pe]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[fg]C[Small and not important. /pem];B[qp];W[qj]
C[Good move from white. I cant play S10 here.];B[qi];W[rj];B[ph]
C[I wanted to save P9 since I could put pressure on white's O10 group.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[mr];B[nr];W[mq];B[nq];W[mn];B[sm]C[This is big, but (as we will see) it's also aji keshi... /pem]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[gb];W[ro];B[so];W[rl]C[...because of this. /pem]
;B[ok]C[The point here is O8. However, it would have beem even more efficient if White hadn't played S8 (which is why T7 ended up being aji keshi, since it provoked White S8). /pem]
;W[ml];B[ol];W[pm];B[ad];W[oi];B[pi];W[bc];B[bk];W[bl];B[bj]

No, this Black corner is alive. /pem];W[ds];B[ar];W[kn];B[jn]
