;B[cl]LB[dk:A]C[Is A better?

Yes, A is much better, because white can cut at C4 and take away the corner, the current move is quite small.]
;W[lp];B[pj]C[K16 is bigger];W[cj]C[Black can play C5 to respond, If White play D8, then Black C7, this way White no longer has a cut in the corner.]
;B[el]C[This move seems to be the only way to response, but in fact not a good move.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[ef];B[fd];W[di];B[ce]C[B16  is better in protecting the corner]
;W[bf];B[fh]LB[dh:A][eh:B][ei:C]C[This is a bad move, Black lost the possibility of B[A\], W[B\], B[C\] cut.]
;W[dh];B[ff]C[Is this move right timing?

No, This is again a bad move, White group is already stable and it is not necessary to seal it. If there is a Black stone at K16, then it is a good move.]
;W[kc];B[nc]C[N17 better];W[hc]C[Now you can see B[F14\] and B[F12\] are not very useful.]
;B[jn]LB[oq:A][np:B]C[Black probably shoud do B[A\] first to take away the base of White. Then B[k6\] is attacking. Otherwise, It is only a escape move.]

Sure, B[B10\] is important for both sides.];W[ar];B[am];W[bk]
;B[hk]LB[jl:A][hj:B][fj:C]C[Not very good, you can consider B[A\], W[B\] and B[C\] connect.]
;W[il];B[gk]C[Too afraid?

It is solid];W[ln];B[km];W[jk];B[ll];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[rr]
;W[or];B[lj]LB[qs:A][pr:B][qp:C][ji:D]C[Is tenuki in the lower right corner ok?

It is ok when you can effective attack the other white group. Otherwise, you should R1 atari and then R4 connect.

To attack, you should consider B[D\] instead of the current move]
;W[ji];B[hh];W[jg];B[hf]LB[jd:A][jc:B][hd:C]C[Can I attack White in a better way and keep the black ones connected?

This is why I suggest K11 earlier, Now you can probably consider B[A\] to B[C\]]
;W[qp];B[rq];W[po]C[This is large];B[rp];W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[pm]
LB[qm:A]C[Is A better?

This way is better.];W[om];B[pl];W[qd];B[qe];W[mk];B[lk];W[lh]
;B[ni];W[re]LB[qc:A][pe:B]C[A real continuation, mistake
B correct answer, according to recent teaching of Hwang In-Seong 7D

Yes, B is common, and I agree with the variations you showed]

C[should extend];W[qh];B[ri];W[pc];B[od];W[qb]LB[kd:A][jd:B]
[je:C]C[B lost a lot here.

So far, I think the situation favors W. However, B still have chance to attak the center group, for example, you can play B[A\] to B[C\] to threaten White. If Black do not attack well here, then chance is not high.]
