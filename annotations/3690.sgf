;B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[oe];W[sb];B[qb];W[qg]C[B: This is joseki, isn't it? Where did I go wrong?





I think nothing wrong till now.];B[ph]
(;W[qh]C[B: The joseki I thought I knew about this said that White can play l17 now. But I was scared I'd get seriously attacked, so I made this move. But I got seriously attacked anyway. How badly would I have done if I'd have played l17?



You not getting seriously attacked, it's even till now.
Black S18 group need to make eyes after white l17.];B[qf];W[rf]

Not quite good, but not quite bad either.];B[jd];W[mb];B[pa]
C[L17?
Black need to make eyes the same as this after white L17, while L17 helps white more than N18.]
;W[na]C[This is a bad move.];B[ra]C[This stone adds pressure to right side white group.
Say Q13 connect is probably sente now.];W[me]TR[od][oe][pf]
[qf][qe][re][ph][pi][pj][pk][qi]C[B: Should I give up on these stones, or play a move like this one?



You doing right, there is no reason to give up these.
Does the black group have 2 eyes??? Let's try kill black group!]
;B[mf];W[le];B[sd];W[lf]C[B: Those 4 stones aren't worth saving, are they? It's not like they're cutting stones.




They are cutting stones anyway, worth something.
This white move is big too.];B[mg];W[lg];B[sf];W[dd]LB[hd:A]
[gd:B][hc:C]C[B: What's the best way to use the thickness I just built up? I want to attack k16, or capture it on a large scale, but I don't know what is the best way.


Places like A,B,C are reasonable.];B[ep];W[pp]C[B: Is this a good way to work with r8?




Not bad.];B[nq];W[lq]C[B: Is the pincer good? I didn't want hime to have a moyo on the bottom side.



not bad.];B[qq];W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[rr];W[ps];B[qr];W[oq];B[rn]

;B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[no];B[nn];W[mn];B[pm];W[lo];B[qm]C[B: Was I right to lose these two stones?



I cannot determine, you lose something. But not a very big loss, and you have sente, so looks not too bad...]
;W[cp];B[dn]C[B: Now I'm scared. I don't want to do as badly as I did in the top right.



I think needn't get scared, and you were not too bad in top right.]

(;W[cn]C[B: This is the other option, right? But I still did so badly. Why?



Either choose simple solutions, or
do not think about "I did so badly.... $*&^%$%&$&" and use the time to think about how to scare and kill your enemy, does all his groups having 2 eyes?]
;B[cm]
(;W[dm]C[B: Anything else would be meek, wouldn't it?



This is fine.];B[en];W[bn];B[cl]
(;W[dl]C[B: Surely I have to save this stone. Otherwise I've given Black the whole of the outside.



This is an option, but not have to.];B[dk];W[el];B[ck];W[ek]
;B[fm];W[ei];B[cq]C[B: In hindsight, I'm not sure I could do anything good about this. And I so wanted to attack those Black stones above. It looks like I had no good response to Black c7.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[dq];B[cr];W[dp];B[eq];W[dr]C[B: I just want enough liberties to attack the above stones. Then I'll be okay.]
