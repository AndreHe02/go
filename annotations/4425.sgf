C[Hi Rahtol,

B got out into a sizable lead and lost it in the middle game. I've put a lot of comments throughout the game, and also a summary at the end.

As you mention, reading is very important, and a few moves here and there would have changed the outcome of the game. In addition, I think it's important for you to always be aware of what is important and what is not on the board, so that you avoid making really small moves.

This game was very interesting and fun to review - so thanks for turning it in! Don't hesitate to e-mail me if you have any more questions about the game, or my comments.

Best,
John];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[ed];B[qo];W[jq];B[do];W[fp];B[dl]
C[usual response is C3, W C4 now gives W the advantage];W[ce]
;B[ci]C[I'd still go for C3 since W left it alone. You're not making much points on the side, but W will in the corner.

> All seems pretty normal to me but please advice.];W[qf];B[nc]
C[This is fine

> To meek ?Better to play a pincer ?];W[qi];B[jc];W[fc];B[ql]
C[I like pressuring from the other side (S16) since you are grabbing a lot more points that way. Also, now you are letting W slide into the corner for easy life.

A W R8/R11/R14 formation may look nice, but it is NOT easy life.]
;W[rc]C[looks like W overplay.]
(;B[qc]C[Weak response.];W[rd];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[cp]C[Pretty big.]
;B[co];W[fn];B[jo]C[This move seems fine. Board has reached sort of a steady state.

I also like M3. This may cause W to build a competing moyo but B's looks bigger.

> still not sure about this move.];W[lp]
(;B[ip]C[I don't like this - you are begging W to reinforce himself, without gaining much in return. The variation should be more likely to lead to good things.

The key when going into opposing territory is keeping your stones 'light', or easy to sacrifice. Your sequence essentially leads you to create a weak group that is too large to sacrifice.]
;W[iq];B[hp]C[Same thing.];W[hq];B[gp]C[This is especially bad because you are hitting the F4 stone, giving W the "step ahead" and creating bad shape for yourself.]
;W[gq];B[of]C[As you say, you have created a weak for yourself. At the same time, you've forced W to secure his territory!

> my bottom group looks awful weak now luckily w doesnt really attack it.]
;W[jp]C[This is a pretty poor/slow attack move.];B[hn];W[ho]
C[?? Must be misread.

If I were W I would continue to split the D5 and G4 black groups with something like F8. B would then have to choose between saving his weak group and reinforce his side group.]
;B[go];W[fo];B[ko];W[gn];B[io]C[This actually turns out pretty well for B.]
;W[fl]C[This is now slow, since the middle B group is no longer weak.]
;B[je]C[B seems to be dominant in this area so no worries extending to K14 instead.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[nq]C[Oof.. W overplay.

Better for W to omit P4 and play O3 directly.];B[no];W[mp]C[W should salvage with N3.]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[nn];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn]
;B[qn];W[km];B[kp]C[No point taking two stones anyway. B should be looking to attack middle W group. I like something like P11, which extends B moyo and cuts off the W middle group's access to the W right group.

> reading mistake. Cost me a liberty.];W[lq];B[lr];W[kq];B[jm]
C[This is pretty slow. Remember B is totally alive because of O3 capture.

I still like the P11, but if you want to attack from this direction, H8 seems better.]
;W[ok];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph]C[Ugh... this pattern again (the same one B used after K5). In general it's pretty bad! You first force W to reinforce his territory, and to top it off you didn't even cut W.

So unless you see an explicit advantage to this pattern, I would avoid it in the future.

Instead of Q13 a couple of moves ago, I would have liked the more obvious Q10.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[rh];B[cc]C[Actually, this is probably what I would have done. B has a solid lead in territory. A safe, successful invasion into W's already low territory will lock up the game for B.

> seems like the wrong tactics now.];W[dc];B[bd];W[cb]C[I think moving B18 first will get you even more.]

(;B[be];W[cd];B[cf];W[bc];B[df]C[payed off though.];W[jl];B[kl]
;W[im];B[jn]C[Yeah, I'm not sure what you guys are fighting over.

A territory grabbing move like K12 might be best here, instead of responding to W at L8.

> I guess forgot that my group is connected to the right hand bottom group. It allowed w to build up in the center quite nicely.]
;W[lm]
(;B[il]C[Bad - is that single W stone (J7) really that important?]
;W[jk];B[hl];W[ij];B[kg]C[Can be a bit more ambitious];W[dm]
C[Yeah, from here things really get complicated - it's hard for me to say with any confidence what the "right" move is.

Instead, I'll just give you the move that I would play, and also some comments on why I wouldn't play yours.

> I totally mishandled this move and lost the game.];B[cm]C[I like E7.

> E7 would have been so much better. But I should have protected my group better in any case.]
;W[cl];B[ck];W[bl]
(;B[em]C[I think B7 instead might work (see variation).];W[dk]
;B[dn];W[cj];B[el]C[You need E9 and then E8 so you can get outside.]
;W[ek];B[bm];W[bk];B[en]C[As you learn later this does not give life. B6 instead gives you E6 and B4 as miai for life.]
;W[bg];B[cg]C[I like B14 directly.];W[bi];B[bf];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[di];B[ff]C[too slow. G13 would've been better.];W[hf];B[ge]
;W[he];B[gd]C[here i tried to bluff w.];W[hd];B[gc];W[gf];B[ee]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[gh];W[eh]C[W should really connect.];B[fg]
C[Yeah, should try to cut even if you can't read it all out.

> It would have been better to cut white off. But i couldn't read it all out.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[ji];B[gg]C[I like cutting.

> also here cutting at K12 would have been better. It shows however how saving this group ruins all of my game.]
;W[jg];B[gj];W[hj];B[eg];W[gi]C[W F11 kills I think.];B[fd]
C[?? Don't see the point of this move.];W[fb]C[No response needed. F11 instead kills again.]
;B[ei]C[B lucky to get ko.];W[dg];B[ag];W[bh];B[dh];W[hm]C[Small.]
;B[gm]C[Whoa! ignore this!];W[dg];B[hg];W[if];B[dh];W[fm];B[gl]
;W[dg];B[ec];W[eb];B[dh];W[ga];B[fh];W[bn]C[this literally kills me.]
;B[bo];W[am];B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[cq];B[an]C[Not good C2 would have saved me.]
;W[ao];B[rj];W[aq];B[ri];W[sg];B[re]C[Hindsight is a beautiful thing.  T15 would have killed the group.]
;W[rf];B[pe];W[qe];B[kf];W[oi];B[nh]C[The rest are endgame moves. I'm too far behind too make a difference.]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[fe]C[This was a lot bigger than the moves you guys were playing. Also K18 area is medium sized.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Reading is obviously very important - a single move would have let you save your C5 group or kill W's S14 group. You should definitely continue praticing life and death situations.

Another thing that you should keep in mind is to avoid playing small moves. Move 65 and 87 are examples, as well as you not ignoring some really small ko threats somewhere in the middle. Just get into the habit of looking at the entire board often and asking if your moves are really making a difference.

> Please advice: how could I have prevented the mistakes made ?
Where should I pay attention ?
Reading is obviously one of my flaws.

Many thanks,
