C[samtregar: Hello.  I played this game on KGS as black.  White seemed to play a very strong game and I found myself falling behind during the middle game.  By the time endgame came I was pretty sure I would lose, and sure enough I did.  I would appreciate pointers on big moves I missed as well as answers to my questions.  If you have questions for me you can find me on KGS as samtregar or email me at sam@tregar.com.  Thank you!


Hello, I'm Danthekyu on kgs];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[samtregar: I play the chinese openning frequently.  As I understand it I should wait for white to try to invade before playing again on the right side.  Is that correct?

Dan: yes and no
you have to extend next either on top or bottom side and if the other still doesn't come in your corner, it is a strong move to close you bottom corner (at Q5)]
;W[jp]LB[po:A][mq:B][jd:a]C[samtregar: I expected A or B on the bottom.  This move didn't make sense to me.

it is a good and perfectly ok move: you could either close at A but that doesn't suit the chinese opening, or play on the top at K16 (C) which is logic with your chinese opening choice.
attacking the other side can be postponed until later]
(;B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[cd];W[cc];B[cj]C[samtregar: too far?  It seemed to work out ok, but looking at it now I want it to be at C11.

i agree
some players even play c12];W[fc]C[samtregar: what is the meaning of this move?  It looks heavy to me.  Is he worried about the cut at D16?

yes, it is a common play by black at handicap games, a bit heavy as you rightly say, but strong]
;B[dn]C[samtregar: Trying to enlarge my territory and attack white at the same time.  I thought this would work better than C6 since C10 is low.

c6 is more common but it seems playable as you say

in fact given what you do next, in the invasion, it would have been better to play d6]
;W[fp];B[jc]C[samtregar: I judged this to be the biggest point on the board.  Was I right?

yes, i even told you before you should have played here or on the 4th line earlier]

(;W[qf]
(;B[nd]LB[qh:A]C[samtregar: I also considered a pincer at A.

no, the pincer is wrong since you have invested k17 already : the variation is better  still]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[white has established a base in blacks territory too easily, which is the sign of a misplay from black]
;B[po]C[samtregar: I was happy to play this.  I thought it made a good shape with R9.  There's a weakness around R7 but I can fix that later, and even if I don't the corner is safe.

yes, ok];W[mq]C[now black ha around 20 point in 3 spots ie 60 in all

white has around 35 in the bottom+10 on the right and 10 at top left + 5.5 komi ie 60 also

no need to do something desperate now
look at variations which all leave you in a better situation than in the game]

(;B[cq]C[samtregar: maybe this was too early?  I thought I needed to do something to keep white from getting the corner and most of the side.

now this move somewhat contradicts d6, you are going to weaken your left side for little profit]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq]C[hum, see variation];W[eq];B[bp];W[bo]
(;B[ap]C[no!];W[cn];B[do]C[samtregar: bad move for me.  I don't know what I was thinking here.

right];W[co];B[cm]C[bad also, but playing in this area is only playing badly because of your bad invasion]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[eo];B[er];W[fr];B[es]C[no, again]
;W[ao];B[br];W[fs]C[you see why it was bad?
allows white to close you in in sente];B[dr]
(;W[ef]C[bad move , losing move];B[dg];W[eg]C[bad];B[eh]C[? hum, maybe extending once more is better

compare with white initial invasion in variation:
pushing instead of invading right away has strengthened black weak position this is good to remember]

(;W[bc]C[hum? not bad but not so good compared to other moves]
;B[ok]C[samtregar: this seemed big to me.  It expands my territory in the lower right corner and looks down at white's moyo for a later invasion.  Was I right?

yes, you should have played here instead of the invasion in bottom left corner]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pb];W[pe]
(;B[oe];W[of];B[nf]TR[oc]C[samtregar: this felt good for me.  I get a nice solid wall that I can use to put presure on the opposite side.

but you are left with a weak spot in delta p17];W[og]
(;B[ie]LB[gb:B][hd:A][jf:C]C[samtregar: looking at this now, it looks too small.  Maybe at A or B?  Or perhaps C?

i do not like the idea of b, too low; a not clear enough;
c too high therefore k15!]
(;W[en]
(;B[lp]LB[mo:B][kp:A]C[samtregar: I decided that I would lose if I didn't do something about white's bottom moyo.  Is this my best chance?  I though about A too.  Maybe B would have been better.  The ensuing fight was too hard for me to read out but in the end I think I did ok.

i am too weak myself to know well, but i think this is not good enough
you missed a weakness by white which would have helped you
on the other end your are not behind to play foolishly]
