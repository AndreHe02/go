C[Dear reviewer,
i played black in this game, i'm quite a beginner and i have especiall troubles with:  proper fuseki play,  using the power of my stones, forming a good shape, estimating the future progress of the game ... well a lot of it :))
Anyway, thanks a lot for sparing time upon my game and helping me to get better.T.

pajaro: Hi. I'm going to review your game. I'll start my comments with "pajaro" ans I hope you can learn something from them.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[pl];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[qn]C[T: How properly shall i handle this ? In game i started fighting ...

pajaro: The invasion is premature. Black is strong below, so to punish white, you should attack that stone, making Q8 stronger and then invade white above.]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[nm];W[nn];B[om];W[on]C[pajaro: This P7-P6 exchange didn't really help black very much. Also, now black has a defect at Q7. If white plays there, black will have 2 cutting points.]
;B[lp]C[T: i wanted to attack white together with creating territory ...

pajaro: Good, but this jump seems too much. N4 also takes profit, and is ahead of O6. On the other hand, don't forget your other black group. Dont' let white counterattack.]
;W[nq]C[T: this seemed strange to me in the game ... but it might have helped white to settle his group a bit

pajaro: This is why M4 was too much.];B[np];W[op];B[pp]
(;W[oo]C[pajaro: White saved the wrong stone. See a possible variation.]
;B[mq]C[pajaro: Success for black.];W[nr];B[or];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[mm];B[ln];W[mn]
(;B[rn]C[pajaro: Is black trying to kill white? He can't. White is already out so he can run into the center easily. Also, with S4 there, black can't connect his group to the corner. Black should make shape.]
;W[ro];B[sm]C[pajaro: NO! This is a very bad shape. Sure, you protect S7 and don't allow a white hane at T6. It's also sente if white want to save S5 and prevent black from connecting. But this should be S7, because white can peep at S8 and make his group stronger.]
;W[qo];B[ml];W[lo]C[T: shall i develop the lower side or protect still unsettled group around p7 as i did in the game ?

pajaro: When white escapes, you will have to help your p7 group, because it has a lot of potential cutting points.]

(;B[ll];W[kp];B[kq];W[mr];B[lr];W[kn];B[fc]C[T: this was mistake that cost me much :( ...

pajaro: Not the best moment to tenuki. Your p7 group still needs help.]
;W[pm]C[T: What now ?

pajaro: Finally. Black is going to lose something. Try to cut your loses to minimun. Defend P8 and save what you can.]

(;B[ql]C[T: I played this and thought : ,,i can live with group r8 and escape with n8 after he cuts me on p8 "

pajaro: R8 alive? I'm not sure. If he can, this can be good. But anyway, n8 will be floating, so white will have another target to attack.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[qj];W[qi]

pajaro: If there is no other way, go on. But in this case, I'm not sure...]

;B[of];W[pf];B[mi];W[rf];B[sg];W[mh]C[T: now i decided to sacrifice 5 stones on n8 and try to gain an influence on the top ...

pajaro: It may be correct, if you get enough compensation.]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[ng];W[mj];B[li];W[lj];B[lh];W[kk]
(;B[id]C[T: is this correct ? I wanted to use my wall and capture some territory ...

pajaro: Walls shouldn't be made to take territory. In this case, perhaps I'd play E15 to make the moyo bigger.]
;W[dj]C[T: i was aware of white's influence in g8 area but i hoped to get to play there first ...]
;B[cf];W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[ch];W[dg];B[cd];W[cg];B[bg];W[dh]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[dc]C[pajaro: As black is already alive, this is small. Take sente and attack D4. F3, for example.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[db];W[bh];B[bf];W[bi];B[gq]C[T: i was glad to play here first and try to reduce white influence here coming from his massive structure around m8 ...

pajaro: F3 is better, you are too close to your strength.];W[jp]
;B[jq];W[kd]C[T: when i played j16 i hoped i will be able to eliminate invasions like this ... what now ?

pajaro: Attack! You can't prevent any invasion only with J16. Don't rely on your opponent's fear.]

pajaro: Resign? Let's see..];W[lm]C[pajaro: B+15.5

Well, I'd say that you both were a bit careless. You have to read what can happen before playing and also check the status of the groups (alive/dead/unsettled). You both missed may chances to kill something. Also, have always an eye on the board. There might be better places to play instead of getting one point or two in a small fight. And enjoy, of course!]
