C[Hello, I play black this game and my rank is about 23k and my opponent is 23k.  This is the first game I've asked to be reviewed so I hope I provided enough information.  I commented where I have specific questions, but please feel free to point out my other mistakes =) Thank you!

Hello,

I hope you will find this review useful.
I have included many variations.
Enjoy!

[pp][nq][oq]SQ[jd]C[I think this move was too defensive.  Would around R10 be good?

--

R15 doesn't really secure the corner, and the corner isn't attacked. So it is pointless.

A would be better, because it promises territory. Maybe a bit difficult because black has to think he must not weaken the trianguled stones, which could get attacked.

But the most important thing, by far, is B. It encloses white's corner, and attack white squared stone. 

If white plays at B, he is going to have it very easy.]

Let's count (all the values are very approximate, and will vary depending on the yose, but it gives an idea).

Black has at best 18 points in the upper right corner, 20 in the right side, about 10 in the left side, and maybe 15 more in the middle. Total: 63.

White has 10 in the lower right corner, 11 in the lower left corner, 22 in the the upper left corner, 17 in the upper side, about 15 in the lower side, and 5 in the right side. Plus komi: 6.5. Total: 86.5

So, you have to make up for about 25 points. It is going to be very difficult, and, except if you manage to play a dirty trick and kill something, I don't think you can win now.

I would try things like S2, or S12 (instead of S14), and, if they fail (which is likely), resign.]

Thanks again =)

I think your biggest mistake is to focus too much on strength (thickness) and not enough on territory, and then forget to attack white's weak groups. 

You gave white enough time to stabilize his groups, which is a bad idea as one can't attack a live group...

To sum up, I'll say one more time:
Thickness is useful not to make territory, but to attack. (and attack is useful usually not to kill but to make profit).

If you have any more question, you are welcome to email me.
