C[Dear reviewer

Thank you for your time.

I played white against a san-ren-sei opening and lost badly. I think my biggest mistake was that my choice of joseki in the upper left corner gave my opponent thickness in the centre which worked well with his san-ren-sei formation. When I played a slow move to counter the thickness, the san-ren-sei formation became very big. I invaded, but the group became heavy and the game was over quickly.

MR: I think that your main problem is having own weak groups you have to live with. In that situations, you play very passively, only looking for your own safety and not noticing that your opponent also has weaknesses you could use.
Also, you do not find the correct shape and tesuji moves in this situations.

I know this phenomenon from my own games. Even today, I sometimes fall back into this mood and play moves worse then necessary only to 120 percent connect my weak stones to the center or to 120% make two eyes locally.

What can you do about it? If you have a KGS account, playing rengo games with a stronger player might be helpful. Watch out for the moves your stronger partner makes in this situations! It might also be helpful if you replay some (uncommented) pro games just to get a feeling for tesuji moves with potentially weak groups.]

(;B[oc]C[MR: In my opinion, the choice of joseki is not good for black. It gives white the opportunity to block at L17, which fits well with the top left corner. For an alternative for black see variation.]

(;W[ed]C[danzhu: I think this is my first serious mistake. The variation would have been better.
MR: I don't think that this is a "serious mistake" - it is just one possible choice of joseki. Most likely, black will not follow your plans as given in your variation ...]
;B[ff];W[df]C[MR: Although cutting is a standard continuation that gives white a big corner, you need not cut here if you do not like giving black a strong outside wall.
However, the best way to avoid giving black thickness here would have been to pincer instead of E15.]

(;B[hf]C[danzhu: Now my top side is flat, and my opponent has thickness in the centre which works well with his san-ren-sei formation.

MR: This move feels very strange to me, black should play an extension on the lower left side.
I agree with you that the white formation on the top looks overconcentrated, but I do not agree with you that the black group on the left is "thickness that works well with the sanrensei". The black stones on the left do not have a base and can potentially become weak in the course of the game.]
;W[cm]C[danzhu: I feared an approach at D6.
MR: Yes, good move. See comment at move 29.];B[jp]C[danzhu: Now my opponent has a nice framework.
MR: ... but not much sure territory ... This is not the type of position I would be too much worried about.
I would continue with R6 or R3, see variations.]

(;W[mn]C[danzhu: My group is heavy, and all my opponent's groups are strong. The game is essentially over.
MR: Urghhh. I would not want to play this kind of move. If you want to connect your stones, L5 is better (although one also does not like to play there as the ladder (K6) is favorable for black). 
You should think of less passive moves. For example, you need not keep your stones connected if you live with the lower part anyway (M3 threatens to live as seen before). In addition, there is also aji in the black formation on the right side, e.g. O7 and P5.]
