AB[pd]C[o the Reviewer:
Hello, and thanks for reviewing my game. I played white in this (my second handicap game\] ever. Although I won in the end i seem to have problems with invading or reducing moyo. Is it possible to get any tips on that field of study?
But also other comments are very welcome!!
KGS might rank me at 22k, but i've only been playing a few months, so I don't feel that high up...so many fields of study :-)

Thanks!]PL[B];B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[qf]LB[ce:A]C[JT: Preventing the shimari with A seems bigger - this seems more like you're trying to build a moyo to the right.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[jc]LB[ce:B][pj:A]C[JT: Although it is a handicap game, I'd play A here. Your stones will be working well together. Also, I think an attack to the top would be better at B.]
;B[lc];W[gc];B[de]C[JT: now your opponent gets a shimari, and your stones are still not completely safe (although they do have a nice base).]
;W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[cj]LB[cd:A]C[Would this move be served better around K4 or thereabouts?
JT: this is fine, as it stabilizes your group and also aims at A.]
;B[dh];W[dj]LB[pj:A][cl:B]C[JT: this move seems too slow. Although there's aji at B, I'd take A now.]
;B[fn];W[el]C[JT: unnecessary. The right side is big now.];B[np]
;W[oq]LB[lq:A]C[JT: I'd rather play a pincer at A. This move, when answered, only makes your opponent stronger, and you'll have to defend at Q6. Also, this doesn't protect against a 3-3 point invasion. Low pincers are one basic technique for making living groups inside the opponen't moyo.]
;B[jp];W[nq]LB[lp:A]C[JT: why not invade at A? Black would have to run, and his lower side moyo would be reduced.]
;B[no]LB[qc:A][pj:D][hp:B][kr:C]TR[pf][qf]C[Probably not the right time to go invading, but if so, where would I best go ?

JT: there aren't very good places for invasion here. The invasion at A should succeed, although damaging the marked stones a bit. Also, an invasion at B should  be able to escape, but I'm not sure it's worth it - you could always slide to C. I'd play D now.]
;W[pn]C[JT: solid, but a bit slow.];B[lq];W[ch]LB[cg:B][pj:A]
C[JT: too slow, your stones are basically alive already. I'd take A. Also, If you really want to go here now, I prefer peeking with B.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[cf];W[pk]LB[pj:A]C[I was more focused on trying to get my own territory going, then reducing his I'm now seeing as I replay my game... This must be a too passive move ?
JT: I think it's just the right direction, but I prefer A (which is the "right" amount of spaces to extend according to the proverb)]
;B[pi];W[oh]C[JT: good.];B[oi];W[nf]LB[ni:A]C[JT: I'd rather play A. This seems too passive.]
;B[lf];W[qi]LB[mh:A]TR[nf][pf][qf][oh]C[JT: I prefer A here, to your opponent from connecting. Also, this doesn't really help your marked stones as your opponent can cut.]
;B[nh];W[ph];B[lh]
(;W[re]LB[qc:B][ni:A]C[JT: I think you should cut at A now. Your opponent will be very thin no matter what he does. Also, this hane makes it impossible to invade at B.]
;B[rd];W[rg];B[se];W[rf];B[ok];W[pj]C[JT: right, connecting these groups is important.]
;B[oj];W[om]LB[ni:B][ol:A]C[JT: I prefer simply A, as it also takes a liberty of the black group, aiming at B.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[mn];W[nm];B[mk];W[mm]LB[cq:A][fr:B]C[JT: I think this is bad because it makes your opponent stronger. There's still aji at A - I think I'd like to try invading with B.]

(;W[bf]LB[fe:A]TR[ge][gf]C[JT: since this exchange ends in gote, I think it's too early to play it now. I'd rather play A now, to cut off and attack the marked stones. See the variations.]

;W[km]LB[ih:A][hk:B][fr:C]C[I kept thinking i had to get to the center.. basically no matter what.. It must be a terrible mistake..I practically gave the territory over to black...
JT: it's not bad, although it's maybe too early to go there now as A and B are still open for you. Anyways, I think around C might still succeed.]
;B[jm];W[ke]LB[mg:A]C[JT: small. I'd play the doublepeek at A.]
