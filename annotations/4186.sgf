C[S: Mostly i want advice on my opening and early middle game, but any other tid bits you feel will help me will be appreciated

A: Hello, my name is Andreas. My rank is about 1d in Europe and 3k on KGS. I marked Your comments with S: and mine with A: . 

A: My first impression in the game was that Your opponent played very territorially while You took advantage of his low moves to build two big frameworks. Your main problem was that Your shape instincts and tactical reading were not strong enough to defend the frameworks properly and punish whites invasions.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce];W[jc]C[A: so far, no difference from a professional opening.]
;B[ep]LB[eq:A]C[This move is also played by professionals, but most professionals play the low approach at A instead. The reason is probably that the left side is not very interesting since c15 is already low.]
;W[gq]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[A common Joseki here starts with black A, the shape move to keep white seperated (and another joseki) is B.]

(;B[en]C[A: Very bad shape in the local situation, white can connect under and black gets almost nothing in exchange.]
;W[eq]C[A: the only move];B[co];W[dp];B[do];W[fp];B[pn]C[S: i feel like this is an unfinished joseki
q6 might have been better around d10

A: Black should play on the left to prevent a white attack on the lower left group. The right side is the biggest open area, but probably not as urgent. Also, a high approach is rather unusual.]
;W[np];B[pj];W[ro]LB[qn:A]C[A: if w wants the corner, he should just attach at A]
;B[rn];W[qo];B[mc]C[S: same thing i feel its unfinished

A: of course black should sooner or later play r6, but playing elsewhere is probably bigger at the moment. White cannot do too much damage in the lower right.]
;W[gc];B[di]C[A: finally supporting the left side...];W[kq]
C[A: this is a bit too low by white. A move on the 4th line or an invasion of blacks formations would be better.]
;B[ko];W[ip]LB[lq:A]C[A: B can now cut at A, damaging whites side but probably creating a weak group. This would not be too bad because black has no other weak groups yet.]

(;B[no]C[This sequence allows white to strengthen his weakness while not gaining black too much.]
;W[mp];B[mo]C[A: Black still has many defects and ends in gote.]
;W[in];B[fe]C[S: is this move too slow?

A: Its very big, an alternative would be R15];W[pg]LB[qd:A]
C[A: an idea would be to attach at A instead.];B[qe];W[qj];B[qk]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[pi];B[oj];W[rj];B[oi];W[qh];B[rg]LB[oh:A]TR[in]
C[A: maybe play A yourself instead, aiming to seal in white. But the marked stone reduces blacks prospects in the center too much.]
;W[oh];B[mj]LB[mi:A]C[A: playing one above at A would be more normal]
;W[nc]C[A: looks like an overplay, the right side is not alive yet.]

C[A: the two catastrophes that happened to You in the game, the lower left corner sequence and the attack on the invasion on the left side, were both related to incorrect shape. Work on Your shape and your game will improve for sure. What I liked about your game was the ability to ignore small threats in order to take big moves.]
