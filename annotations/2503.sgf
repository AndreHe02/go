RE[W+Time]

C[Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game and lost by time so my last few moves were played in complete panic. I find i have great difficulty estimating territory and my fighting is quite horrible. Not much fighting in this game though. I think that i wasn't doing badly until before the last sequence, though white was probably winning. I'm submitting this because i'm interested in your general opinion of my play and because i must have made lots of mistakes which i failed to notice. I sometimes find i have no ideas about which move to play, and that cannot possibly be good. Also, any variations would be welcome. Thank you very much for reviewing my game.

Joonas Tyystjärvi: Black got a very favorable position in the beginning and was winning before the mistake in handling white's invasion. After that, black still had chances by attacking the weak white group, but missed that by trying too hard to make territory in the center. I've added some variations and comments in the game file, please look at them.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq];W[hq];B[en]LB[do:A]TR[hq]C[JT: this is good - another possibility is A, giving a somewhat stronger attack against the triangled stone.]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dq];B[ep];W[lq]
(;B[qo]LB[po:A]C[D: I thought about playing D7 first, but i was afraid of white playing q5. After closer examination i don't think white can tenuki if i play D7.

JT: A is nothing to be afraid about. I like making a shimari here, but I'd prefer A - stronger against the white stones.]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[co];B[dm];W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[de]C[JT: the game is already favorable for black - although white has some territory in the lower left, he also has a weak group.]
;W[cg]
(;B[ec]TR[cg]LB[be:a]C[JT: I think simply A is best now - after that, the triangled stone is weak because of black's thickness. Letting white connect is too mild because of black's thickness in the lower left.]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[ce];B[df];W[cf]LB[ee:A]C[JT: now black has bad shape because of the cut at A.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[fg]LB[ff:A]C[JT: A is better shape ("play at the middle of the three stones")]
;W[kc];B[mc]LB[ic:A]C[JT: correct! A would be overconcentrated and let white settle.]
;W[hc];B[eh]LB[pj:A]C[JT: this is not really necessary - white can't hope to attack this wall with his weak group. I'd prefer to take the big point at A now.]
;W[qc]LB[qf:B][qi:A][ql:C]C[D: I think this invasion is bad for white.

JT: I agree - white A, making miai of B and C, would be better.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa]
LB[od:A]C[JT: joseki has a cut at A here.]
(;B[le]LB[ne:A][pf:B]C[D: Would the cap at L15 be a better move than the game? i was afraid of the cut at P16, but later found i have nothing to fear.

JT: the cut is certainly annoying - so much so that I'd prefer a closer move (possibly A) to fix it. Black's shape on the right has a nasty defect at B if white gets to cut.]
;W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[lf]C[JT: the cut still has a bit of bad aji (shown later).]
;W[fb]C[JT: now, this is just silly.];B[eb]C[JT: correct.];W[db]
;B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[cb]C[JT: white has now damaged his own position in gote.]
;B[mn]LB[lo:A]C[JT: this is a good point! However, I'd prefer A here - that move applies more pressure on white.]
;W[pj]C[JT: this is quite unreasonable.]
(;B[mj]LB[ql:a]C[JT: I'd prefer to start with A here. Black's walls are so high that white doesn't really have anywhere to run.]
;W[qm];B[qk]C[D: I have no idea if this is good or not. I make a mistake later on, so white gets stabilized, and if i didn't make it white would be eyeless.. now that i think about it, would i be stretched too thin to contain (or kill, but hardly a chance of that) white after the eye-stealing sequence?
JT: white's chances to live are still pretty small.];W[pk]
(;B[qj]LB[ql:a]C[JT: I'd prefer just A here - if black connects, this point is meaningless for white.]
;W[qi]
(;B[ri]LB[ql:a][rm:b]C[D: S7 much much better?
JT: starting with A is still better. B lets white live on the edge.]
;W[rh];B[qh]C[D: S9 or S10 now?

JT: it's better to cut first.];W[pi]
(;B[rg];W[rj];B[sh];W[rk];B[jq]LB[ip:A][kp:B]C[D: About time to attack this group i thought. i was happy with the result, but is there a better variation possible, or is this move bad?

JT: this is the only attack that can work. Black is strong on both sides, so a reduction (like A or B ) would be much too slack.]
;W[jr]
(;B[iq]LB[kr:a][ir:b]C[JT: this is a pretty vulgar move, and black gets bad shape. I think the hane at A is best (B is worse).]
;W[ir];B[hp];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[JT: this cut forces white to patch his shape.];W[hr]
;B[ho];W[kq];B[kp];W[lp];B[ko];W[ig]C[D: I noticed my time was running very short here so my next moves are absolutely horrible. after this last sequence i would resign even if i didn't run out of time. Also this white move hurts my position badly.]

(;B[jg]LB[jf:a]C[JT: I think the vulgar cut at A gives a better result.]
