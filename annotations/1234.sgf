C[Info for reviewer:

This game was played in KGS without time limits. Players were (with KGS ratings):

White: seppos (that's me!), 1 dan
Black: Antti, 2 kyu

We live in the same city so we knew that handicaps were not necessary even we have some gap in KGS ratings.

This was quite a long game, it lasted at least one and half hour, probably more. Quite peaceful also, and in the end white won by 2.5 points. Komi was 5.5 points.

I wrote my thoughts during the game and also some questions. I'll send the review to Antti too so also comments for his moves are welcome (he didn't had any special questions about this game but surely is interested in comments).

So this was not a fast game, every move was given some thought.

I've played go quite a long time without significant improvement. I hope this review could show some weaknesses in my game, and maybe even get some suggestions how to improve my game.

Antti is totally different, he has played go only about half a year and is already a tough opponent.

Many thanks to the reviewer in advance!];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp]
;B[de];W[fc]LB[fd:A][ce:B][dh:C]C[reid: White F17 is usually considered a special purpose move, perhaps even a trick play.  There doesn't seem to be much reason for it now, so perhaps white should simply play a normal joseki with any of A, B, C, or perhaps in one of the other corners.]
;B[ci]C[reid: Nonetheless, black gives white the chance to make his trick play into a good move.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[reid: Black C11 should now be at A or B, so white's F17 has become a good move.]
;W[jq]LB[cn:A]C[reid: This feels a bit slow.  Rather like what black might do in a no-komi game.  With this kind of relaxed pace, white could easily lose the advantage he gained from the upper left corner.

In the early part of the game, taking and approaching the corners are usually the biggest moves.  Whte has three corners to consider.  How does he choose?

You always need to consider all the stones that have already been played.  Each stone affects the overall judgement.

In this game, white should look at what's wrong with the black shape at C11 and take advantage of it.  Since  C11 is too close to C14, black wants to stretch out with a move like A or D6 to make his formation work better.  White can prevent that with A, taking the corner and making it difficult for black to get full use out of his D14 stones.

Going one further with C7 might seem bigger, but since the black D14 formation is overly strong, white C7 leaves too much weakness in the corner.  Besides, C6 leaves another extension to C9.]
;B[nq];W[qj];B[cn];W[fp];B[en];W[co];B[bn]C[reid: Oops.  Now it looks like black C11 is a good move!  If it were at the joseki position of D10 or C10, it would be too close to the new C6/E6 wall.

We can see from this that white should have done something different than F4.  Black E6 is too good.

White needed to do something like D6 instead of F4.  See variations.

Of course, if white had played C6 instead of K3, none of this would have happened.]

(;W[nc]LB[qf:A]C[Quite uneventful fuseki so far. This move is really not spectacular but I didn't find any bigger moves.

reid: Uneventfull perhaps, yet filled with missed opportunites :-)  But that's the way amateur games are, of course.  My own personal goal is to get through my first 10 moves without making a move my teacher considers a mistake.   White O17 is a problem in direction.  Since white is low at F17, the entire top side is unimportant.  White should approach from A to help his lone R10 stone and try to make black play at O17.]
;B[me]LB[pc:E][ne:A][oe:B][pf:C][qf:D]C[This is Antti's 'special' move. I'm not sure what will happen (and if it is really reasonable for black) after white O15 but Antti has some positive thoughts about that. :)

Anyway, in this position I was quite satisfied to invade the corner, though. After that, N15 is not positioned very efficiently I think.

reid: Well, I'll say this: I've never seen it before :-)

Looks to me like all of A-E lead to good results for white.]
;W[qc]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[reid:  This would be good if black answered at A.  But if he blocks on the other side at B, N15 looks like it could turn into a good move.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[lc]LB[qg:A]C[reid: Too small.  Again, the top side is small because of F17.  Continuing with A is better - make white crawl.]
;W[pb]LB[qg:A]C[reid:  This is a joseki-type move when black has already captured O17 and there's no hope of using it, or if white needs the R18 connection in sente.  Neither is true in this shape, so Q18 is aji-keshi.  Simply hane at A looks better (black Q18 and R18 are not sente).]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qg];B[pg]
(;W[qh]C[reid: So passive!  Why not hane again?  See variation.]
;B[mg]LB[ge:B][qm:C][cq:A]C[In my opinion black is hugely overconcentrated and there's still some aji left. So I think I got better result here.

However, Black did get influence to the center.

I was quite lost how to handle that influence. I have almost always problems with handling opponent's moyos (and here it's clearly emerging). So I'd like to get some comments the way I played next and maybe to see some better moves for that 'influence handling'.

reid:  Then let's make this the core lesson for white in this game:  your statements here are exactly correct, and if you study your own words, I think you'll see that you *can* reach a higher level - you just need to listen to your inner voice.

I agree - if all black got out of this exchange was the outside influence, this corner would be a big loss for him.  But, his new influence is beautifully placed to cooperate with his left-side formation.

To counter this, white has only small territories in the two upper corners.  The lower-left corner is vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion which would make the bottom side a net loss for white (counting in the lower right black corner)

However, all that said, black N13 is too slow.All of A, B, and even C would be bigger now.  Black should not worry about a white cut at Q15 - he can always give up R15/R14 if he needs to.]
;W[ej];B[dj]LB[dk:A][ek:B][dl:C]C[reid:  If black wants to simply defend his territory (probably reasonable in this game), A is more natural.

I like to tell students: "you touch me, you help me".  In this case, black touches E10 with D10 and therby helps white to get a few more forcing moves in this area.  If instead black plays A, white might play B forcing black C and white is really too heavy (and black ends with more territory).]
;W[el]C[This is probably too heavy but fortunately black answered it peacefully.]
;B[dm];W[dk];B[ck];W[di];B[cj];W[gj]LB[hj:B][ij:A]C[So, was this reduction sequence even semi-sensible? :)

reid:  Given that black defended at D10, white did OK.  But G10 is a bit awkward.  If black caps at A now, white will have some hard fighting ahead.

Playing lightly with B (instead of G10) would be an improvement.]
;B[hq]LB[hc:C][ij:A][qm:B][cq:D]C[reid: This invasion seems a bit premature.  Since black still has the 3-3 invasion, he doesn't need to rush for H3.  Attacking the center white group, perhaps with the capping move at A, would be a more positive approach.  Or B, C, and the 3-3 invasion at D all seem possible.]
;W[fq]LB[hp:A]C[reid:  Now it's white defending territory.

Given the weakness of the white center stones, I think white would be better off trying to enclose black with A.  There's not much territory to the left of F3 (because of the 3-3 invasion), so F3 doesn't do much for white.]
;B[ho];W[jo]
(;B[go]C[I think this is mistake because there is still connection in H2 and black misses the opportunity to attack two weak groups?

reid:  Yes, black can do better.  How about the variation?]
;W[hr]LB[im:A][fn:C][gn:D][fo:B]C[reid:  Just because white *can* connect doesn't mean that he *should*.  Connecting on the second line should be a last resort.  In this shape, white must consider if he can keep both groups alive if black does complete the seperation with a move around H2.  If white plays A instead of H2, he threatens to cut black with white B, black C, white D so he doesn't need H2 just yet.

In any case, blocking at B5 to make the corner safe is a much bigger move than H2.]
;B[gr];W[gq];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hs];W[jr]C[reid:  Does white prefer the K2 side to the F2 side?  I think I'd rather try to keep the corner, forcing black along the second line to the right.]
;B[fr];W[er];B[fs];W[gp]C[Now G5 is quite obsolete so I should be satisfied with this result? Although I have no eyes nor territory there..

reid: No eyes, and look at the F4/G4/F3/G3 formation.  Four stones doing the job of two.  Not very good.]
;B[ql]LB[gl:A]C[reid: This looks too far.  Black is ahead at this point, so he shouldn't give white the obvious opportunity of invading at R6.

I'd like to see black think about attacking the center to finish off the game.  Black A looks like a good attacking point.]
;W[nb]C[reid: If white loses these stones, he has just donated about three and a half points to black.]
;B[oa];W[jc]C[This was maybe overplay, better in J17?

reid: J17 may not be sente.];B[kb];W[qn]C[I think I must have stone here in R6 before invasion in R3 succeeds. Am I right?

reid: I don't think that's quite the right question to be asking.  R3 might work (or Q3 which looks a bit easier), but if you look at the whole board situation, is an R3 invasion (which will certainly cause black to get thick on the outside) going to get a good board result for white?  With two weak groups on the board now (F10 and F4), I would not tempt fate by trying a deep invasion right now.]
;B[pn];W[qo]C[So I abandoned the invasion after all and started to make life in the side instead. :)

reid: allowing black to get thickness where it could do some real damage to your two weak groups.]
;B[po];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[rm];W[rn];B[sn];W[so];B[sm];W[qm]
;B[pm];W[ro];B[rl];W[qr];B[pr];W[rs]C[Afterwards I thought It would be better just to play s2.]
;B[ol]LB[pk:A]C[reid: black asks white to peep at A.];W[pk]
C[reid: white obliges.];B[pl]C[reid: So now we ask ourselves "is the exchange of black P8 for white Q9 better for black or for white?"

Black should simply connected with Q8 instead of the hanging connection at P8 (remove both P8 and Q9 to see the difference).]
;W[gm]C[I would like to hear something about this move. Personally I thought this was the only 'clever' move in my game.. I usually play just simple and safe. :)

reid:  Simple and safe?  Where's the fun in that? -:)

Hmmm, I think black should have gotten to this area first.  Like about 40 moves ago.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[fn]LB[in:A]C[reid:  This move is a perfect demonstration of what both players need to work on to improve!

Black has strength all around, white has two weak groups, and yet black meekly connects two stones.

If black doesn't want to use these two stones for anything, then they aren't even worth connecting - take a big point somewhere else, if you must.

But black needs to see the 6 center white stones as being weaker than the two H5 stones.  Why?  Because white cannot cut them in sente, they have lots of friends to run towards (O8 and N13) and they are splitting two weak groups.  Black *must* continue to split these groups with A!

Connecting at F6 is pure gote.  If black runs at A instead, then depending on how the fight goes, he may never need to play F6 at all.  In any case, he always has F6 to fall back on if he needs to connect (although F5 looks like it would have a bit more effect on white).]
;W[jm]LB[hl:C][in:A][jn:B]C[reid: A would be more like a connection.  With K7, A is still a good peep for black (if white B, black C is a good continuation).]
;B[hc];W[jg]C[Well actually I also liked this move. :) I can't wait to get some negative comment about it...

reid: Hmmm, ok.  I'm not sure what this move is doing?  It doesn't seem to be defending the main white weaknesses or attacking any black stones.  And it doesn't seem to take any territory.

White still has about 35 points.  Black has at least 40.  White needs to start gambling before black walks off with the game!]
;B[ie]LB[hh:A][ii:B]C[reid:  Black is thinking too small here.  He seems to be saying he'd be happy if white lets him take K17.  And besides, white K15 is too good (and too easy) an answer.

I think black should take the white weaknesses on the bottom and in the center into account.  Something around A or B might be interesting.

My teacher likes to say "if you're going to eat chicken, make sure it's a big chicken - fatten it up first".  Black threatens to take *both* K17 and K13.  Or maybe part or all of the G10 stones.

Black is thick all around.  He can play with a free hand.];W[je]
;B[jf];W[if];B[kf];W[id];B[he];W[hd];B[ib];W[gd];B[ke];W[jd]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[hg]C[reid: black gained nothing from the sequence since 101, but white is getting enough stones in place to finally be comfortable with his center stones.  He may even get some territory there.  This looks like where black lost the game.]
;W[hh]C[During the game I got the feeling that both of us were quite satisfied with this result.   But again in my opinion this was better for me. But how in earth can this game be so close if I (supposedly) got better results everywhere. :) Maybe I'm just an overly optimistic go player or my positional judgement is really crappy.

reid: Indeed, this result is good for white.  But white has been playing catch-up, so the game is back to even now.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[im];W[il];B[kl]C[Actually I was afraid of black's cut here. So I criticized this move to be aji keshi.

But after game I started to think that maybe this is Ok, cutting here now could be easily overplay. Still wasting the aji this way feels bad.

reid:  Yes, cutting would be better.  But probably too late after white gets H12, etc.  Still, forcing white to remove his last weakness is terrible.]
;W[jl]C[So, now I'm thick, I have profit in center and no problems with any my groups.]
;B[ln]C[Ok, also black got profit :)

Now endgame starts. Personally I'm not very interested in endgame (and it probably shows in the game..) and no doubt there is some grave mistakes by both players.

So, dear Reviewer, if you have some comments for the endgame I am pleased to hear them, but I am more interested for the fuseki and middle game comments.

Now position seem to be quite even and that was also the result.

No further comments in this sgf by seppos. I hope the game is not too boring to go trough...

reid:  No endgame comments by me, either.

I hope both players get some ideas on how to improve their play, and at the same time, work more excitment into the game.

To me, the spirit of go is all about fighting.  Which is not to say that you should hack and slash heedlessly, but the real subtlety and joy of the game lies in the threats and counter-threats that come from a whole-board analysis.   Think big, and don't get too distracted by small fights.  Taking 20 points in gote is hard work.  Taking 1 point in sente is easy.  Attack to make those small sente gains, and defend to deny your opponent the same opportunites.]

Grabbing the corner with A might occur to one, but there's a lot of space for a black invasion around B, so it's a bit dangerous.  Tsuki-nobe (and variations) is always something to consider, but it doesn't seem to work too well.  See the first variation.  And of course there are pincers at D and E.   If white D, black jumps to F, white B (or F4) and black E is a terrible result for white (because of black C11).  So the high pincer at E is left.  See second variation]
