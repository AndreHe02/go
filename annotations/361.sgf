PL[B];B[pd]C[Hi!

I hope you like this review and that you will  send it to  your opponent too. I always comment for both  sides as  it is easier for me. I hope the text isn't too  boring and  that variations are helpful.

Don't forget to read the comments at the end.

P.s. I use Hibiscus Go for making review. If  you have  any problems with the sgf, any questions  etc... contact  me at goran.siska@kiss.uni-lj.si]

(;W[hc]LB[hc:8][df:a][cf:b][id:c][dj:d]C[No problem up to this point.  White 8 seems a bit off the mark. The  usual idea here is to play a or b (See var.).  You should notice white is missing a stone  at d which means a pincer at c is more  attractive (See var.).]

1. To fully utilize white marked stone white  should extend to black 15
2. The correct direction of play with black  15 on board is white b - this would drive  black toward whites strong group
3. If white insists playing from this side it  should at least be at a, this makes a lot of  difference later...]
;B[cn]LB[cn:17][ch:a][cm:b][cl:c]C[With white at a black couldn't extend this  far - black would play at b. Longer  extension leaves a weakness at c but  because white stone is not at a the  weakness is not so dangerous.]

(;W[fq]LB[fq:18][fp:a]C[With the marked stone in place a is a  better shape to achieve a high-low balance  on the side.

C[Well I hope I did my job on this one.
I hope tewari and jose miru are new  concepts that you understand now. I  recommend you read "The direction of play"  by Kajiwara (I think). That should help a lot.
You went wrong in the opening and your  opponent took full advantage on it. Locally  you both need to work on your shapes. I  hope this helps...

As always questions, thx., hellos send to:

Note that  if white played 18 first and then invaded at  16 black would surely just defended the  corner. In that case whites efforts would  overlap (strengthening the shape and  playing 18).
