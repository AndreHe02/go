C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.  I'd especially appreciate any advice you have not just on specific moves, but also the reasoning process behind them.  Thanks!

Arend: Exciting game! Very close throughout, and the lead changed a few times. 
The only mistakes in direction you made in this game was in the way you delt with the white invasion at K17 (first attacking the stone from the wrong direction, then trying to continue to attack when you had too many weaknesses). I think these two mistakes are instructive, and very typical of the bad habits you have to get rid of on your way to 2d or so.

Later, you fought back well in the lower left corner, and lost only due to some imprecise endgame moves.]

;W[co];B[fq];W[go];B[gq];W[ci]C[Arend: This may be a little slow.]
;B[qn]C[Arend: Right direction.];W[nq]C[Arend: Since the lower side is uninteresting (as Black has a very solid and low group in the lower left), White should think about a pincer.]
;B[pj]C[Arend: Kakari in the upper left seems biggest for White now.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qf]
(;B[oe]C[I didn't want to give w a solid group by b o16 --> w r17, etc.
Arend: I think both are possible. If you don't like White getting a solid group to the right, you can use one of the alternatives I show in the variations.]
;W[qi]C[Arend: This seems bad. 3-3 is the only move.];B[qj]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[Arend: This exchange gives away a lot of territory.]
;W[rc];B[qg]LB[rb:C][pc:B][qd:A][ri:D]C[I just felt like trying this -- probably not a good move.
Arend: It is interesting shape-wise. But if you mentally add the White A - Black B exchange, it looses some of its appeal. Probably one of the boring moves at C or D is best.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rg]LB[dc:B][ic:A][fd:D]
[hd:C]C[At least I got p 14 in sente.  Now the question is -- what is the best move on the top/top left?  I thought about a shimari at d17, or a conservative expansion at j17, but that seemed to slow.



Any advice for next moves and follow-ups  would be greatly appreciated -- I felt a bit lost for the next move. 

Arend: You can be happy about this position. White's mistakes on the right side means that you are leading now.

One helpful guideline here is that you should play a move where it is not obvious where White should enter your moyo next. Of course weak points will remain, but if there is no obvious weakest, then your move probably has a good balance.
If you play at J17, then it is obvious that White should enter the corner. (In fact, J17 makes you overconcentrated on the right.) A shimari at B leaves lots of space for White to enter between your positions. (see var.).
With your game move at C, I think it is still too easy for White to enter the corner at B.
I would try the less orthodox shimari at D. It makes it difficult enough to enter the corner, and you will get a good attack on any invasion move along the top.]

(;B[hd];W[jc]C[Arend: Wrong invasion point.]
(;B[kd]TR[jc]C[Arend: But this Black answers makes it a good move. Play away from thickness! The marked white stone now has become a good kikashi...]
;W[fc]C[Here I thought about just h17, but w could expand the left and attack the corner in sente at the same time, making it easier to reduce my top anyway.  Or so I reasoned.  Should I have just played h17 anyway?

Arend:...and White does well to treat it as such. There is no good move for black now. I think the shimari is the best you can do now, for exactly the reasons you give.]
;B[dc];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[gd];W[ec];B[db];W[ee]
(;B[eg]LB[jd:A][df:B][dh:C]C[Was there a better attacking/splitting move or strategy?

Arend: You must not try to attack here. The hole at A is a VERY BIG weakness in you position. (Excuse the all-caps, but it is really that big. You should be horrified of this weakness after looking at this position for half a second :)
Such a capping move creates even more weakness in your position. And White has good shape and almost two eyes. Besides you have no good answer to B. See variation for the result Black can dream of in this position.

(If you were stronger on the top, the attacking move here would be C. Either you can weaken the position below (if White defends the top), or if White replies locally, you gain strength to attack the top group more seriously. A "leaning attack".)]
;W[fe];B[hg];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[ei];W[jd];B[je];W[lb];B[md]
LB[ke:A]C[I hated playing this.  Better moves?
Arend: As you have read out, you cannot prevent White from connecting. I think A is best, as it (almost) cures the annoying weakness for good.]
;W[mb];B[jk]LB[ke:A]SQ[md]C[This was probably the hardest choice in the game for me.  Protecting around n10 seemed safer, but I thought the drawbacks were 1) a bit slow/defensive-minded  and 2) it would  allow white to expand his own territory on the bottom left while.  So this was my best guess for expanding my own moyo or else, if he doesn't defend, doing more damage to his.  Are there better moves/ways of thinking about what to do here?  I would really appreciate seeing a variation or two.

Arend: First of all, this choice would be easier now if the marked stone was placed at A. A lot less defects in the top to worry about.
Secondly, when building a moyo first try to play all kikashis against opponent's stones that might be useful. Here you should exchange D9 for C9. 

Finally, I think K9 is a fine decision. N10 would be a bit too small. You have to be prepared that White will entersomewhere. But it is better to accept this fight and try to gain from the weak group, than to build the moyo too small from the very beginning.]
;W[jf];B[if]LB[ie:A]C[Arend: Better at A.];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni]
;B[mh];W[ke];B[ie];W[oi];B[og];W[qh];B[mi];W[qo]C[White got to this key point first, but at the time n11 seemed too big for both to omit.  Should I have played s4 or something else?
Arend: I think N11 was too important to omit.];B[pn];W[ol]C[I was frustrated by this move.
Arend: No reason to be frustrated.];B[ql]LB[rl:D][rm:B][rn:A]
[ro:C][qq:E]SQ[ol]C[I thought if I ran, white would just increase territory and I would be playing on dame points.  So I protected.

Arend: Yes, this is the only move. If white gets to play here, you are in trouble. In fact, the marked exchange is a clear gain for black. The marked white stone is almost useless, a neutral point. On the other hand, the black stone makes the black shap extremely stable. Imagine the sequence White A - Black B - White C - now the marked black stone is very useful. White D was also an option before this exchange, which does not work anymore. Also, Black has better eye shape, and thus a better chance to invade the corner at E.]

(;B[bm]C[Just c7 or even b6 would be better?
Arend: Yes. The problem with this move is that you cannot cut after White 8. B6 is the most severe move, and I think it works. C7 is better shape than b7.]
