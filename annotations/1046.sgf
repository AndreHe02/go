;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[qi];W[ok]C[klin: K17 is the big point now. P9 is slow.]
;B[jc]C[i considered playing at c10 or d10, but this seems to give black an easy game.

klin: B gets K17, in good shape.  Now W can play either C10 or D10.]
;W[je]C[I tried this approach move. What other options do i have ?

klin: K15 playable.  the problem is the next few moves.];B[lc]
C[klin: W K15, B M17 exchange is good for W.];W[le]C[I tried to limit black moyo with M15, but i'm not sure this is a good idea. Would H16 have been better ?

klin: M15 is a very bad move.  After K15 M17 exchange, B moyo is flat.  No need to keep going.  H16 is better.  Or go back to play C10 or D10.  It is a good time for R17 too.  If B Q17, W S16.  (Those are more advanced moves.)]
;B[hd]C[Here i think i made a big mistake (i played P11) , although i didn't notice anything during the game.

I tried to work on variations starting with White P11 at R13.

Could you tell me if these variations are ok ?

klin: W M15, B H16 excanhe favors B.]
(;W[oi]C[klin: P 11 is not bad.  The problem was M15.];B[qg]
C[klin: After P11 R13 exchange, W still has R17.];W[fc];B[cj]
C[klin: C10 is bigger than F17.];W[cl];B[cf];W[bd];B[dh];W[og]
C[klin: P13 is not good.  You have to stop playing moves like P13 and M15.]
;B[ne];W[mf]C[very painfull for me to play n14....];B[fq];W[dq]
;B[iq];W[kq]C[L3 seemed to be the only way to get back in the game. What other moves should i play ?

klin: L3 is not good.  W has a moyo in the center.  The invasion creates a group being chased to the center and destroying the moyo.  W could play at H4, B H3, W F4.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[nn]C[I don't like to play M6, because it induces a black reinforcement at K6, so i cut directly. Good idea ?

klin: Either is OK.];W[jn];B[io];W[mq]C[klin: N3 very bad.  After the cut, W has to do something to get out.]
;B[nq]C[klin: B O3 bad too.  B should M6 or M7.  W is bad even if it can make two eyes.]
;W[jm]C[klin: K7 a dangerous move.  Are you sure W can make two eyes?]
;B[km];W[kl];B[mn];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[eo];W[lr];B[do]C[klin:  You see the results now.  Even if W lives here, it is bad.  All because of the L3 invasion and K7.]

C[klin: W still needs Ko to live.  It is a disaster.  My comments stop here.]

Maybe it's better for white not to make the O12/O11 exchange ?]
