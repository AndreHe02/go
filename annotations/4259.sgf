C[Reviewer:

Thank you for taking a look at this game.  I felt that both sides played their best.  White made a couple mistakes in the middle game (a deep invasion and a bad response to a reduction), and black played a sloppy endgame.  We'd both be interested in hearing your comments about direction of play and the exchanges we made in the middle game.

Thank you!

C[M:  Is there a better joseki choice here?  I was willing to take a loss to end in sente and attack the bottom right, but I ended in gote.]
;W[cb];B[dd];W[bc];B[ec];W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ee];W[df]C[Instead of this white peep at D14 which strengthens black and doesn't stablize white, I'd rather see white play something like C9 which makes territory and stablizes white.]
;B[de];W[qj]C[M:  Better for white to attack the corner?  Or is this fine, what with the shimari in the top right?


Now the two D12 white stones can be attacked by a black stone somewhere around D9 .]
;B[qo]C[M:  What joseki is a better choice?  I ended up fixing white's shape.


I don't like black R5 since if white r6 and black r4 and white q6, then if black plays the normal o3 extension, white can take sente since the r10 stone is already there.

Also, it looks good for white to answer this r5 move by playing q4 and then if black r4, white cn play p3, and start building a position that works well with d4.

so, maybe instead of black r5, I'd consider black o4 .  I'd think abou p5 for black instead of o4 or r5, but I'm not sure.  ask a stronger player !  (i'm 5k on kgs)]

now white gets sente, since r10 already there.];W[jq]C[
i'd be a bit nervous about playing w k3 because when black plays h3, white is caught between a strong black position and black' s stone.

maybe w j3 is safer because it allows an extension to either m3 or f3.]

;B[dn];W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[cj];W[ld]C[M:  This seemed too deep to both of us, when we reviewed after the game.]

;B[kd];W[le];B[kf];W[mf];B[me];W[nf]C[

i'd think about atari at o15 for white instead of o14.];B[ne]
;W[oe];B[mc]C[M:  Is this an equal trade?  White got a lot of forcing moves, and R12 doesn't have much aji that I can see.]
;W[od];B[nc]C[
this is why i liked the possibility of the white atari at o15.  white doesn't give up so much on top.]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[qf];B[lh]C[M:  I couldn't see much useful aji from R12, so I thought it better to get out in sente and let it be captured.]
;W[nh];B[lq]C[M:  I think I made a bad choice here.  I wanted to jump out to N6, but I saw later that white could just reinforce both sides.  My other choice was to undercut D12 (hopefully stabilizing the bottom right group).   What do you think the biggest point is?]
;W[jo];B[mn];W[bg]C[
instead of white b13, how about an invasion at c8 ?  the b13 move would be ok if the black stones above were attackable but they're not.]
;B[pl]C[M:  This seemed too good to pass up.  I want to end in sente and stabilize the bottom right.]

(;W[ql]C[
instead of w r8, can w play p7 and capture black ?

but black left big hole at c8 (even bigger now that white played b13) .

So I like black e10 instead of q8.  black e10 both protects black's fort and attacks all the upper white stones.]
;B[pk];W[pj]C[
instead of white q10, i'd consider white r9, then if black pushes at q10, then block which threatens w p8, so black has to protect which lets w protect if necessary.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj];B[qm]C[

not good for w !  black got away with way too much here.];W[nn]
C[
instead of this o6 for w, how about p7 which threatens s6.]
;B[nm];W[no];B[mo];W[rn];B[nl];W[cl]C[
black took huge profit in lower right.];B[dl]C[M:  Aiming to get out to the center.  I am hoping to get in at H3 or H4 later.


i would think about black d9 instead of d8.];W[dm]C[
how about w c7 instead of d7 ?];B[cm];W[dk];B[em];W[ck];B[ek]
;W[dj]C[

black got too easy a position here];B[ej]C[
this b e10 doesn't do much.

how about g12 instead, threatening te g14 or f14 ataris ?];W[ei]
;B[bm];W[fl]C[
this is the time to count.

w is behind, so w needs to think about how to catch up.

various moves that look large for w.   L2 since it's big for b also !

some reading is necessary.   if a b move at g12 can't be captured, then i white plays something like g11 first, that makes a big diference.

t8 looks like sente also.
