AB[pd][dp]C[hi

this is my first request for a review, so all kind of comments are welcome. the game ended up quite close, and it felt like being one of the few where I like how I played. I could not find any big mistakes, except for the failed invasion in the lower part of course. I'd like to thank you in advance for any hints you might give on what to do better (in strategy or tactics).

[gromit\] Hi!
I'll do my best, but if there are remaining questions, please don't hesitate to ask me, either online (on KGS) or by e-mail.

P.S. Why is it a 2 stone game?];W[pp];B[ed];W[cd];B[df];W[ec]

[qq]SQ[jp]C[[gromit\] Hmm, up to now was quite reasonable, but R11 seems a bit strange to me.
It is a bit far from R6 (if W P8 no underneath connection) and doesn't help it much.
P6 or R3 are more common.
Here, P6 to avoid W making a big wall in front of K4 would seem quite simple.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[po];B[qm];W[pm];B[qp];W[qq]TR[pq]C[[gromit\] Q3 was probably better for W (leaving no weakness in the wall)]
;B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[oq];B[pl]
(;W[ol]TR[pk]C[[gromit\] Since W chose to add P3, his wall is solid enough to resist and play Q9 instead, see var.]

(;B[fb]C[N17 right away?

[gromit\] yes, W should have invaded at L17 to have a possible extension on both sides.
Here checking at M17 leaves very little room for W.
Moreover it will allow B to build in the top right, see var.]
;W[nc];B[pc]TR[lc]C[[gromit\] solid but a bit passive: W overextended a bit and left a weakness around M17.
Invadind straight away seems possible and more severe.];W[ne]

useless? L10 would help W at least as much.];B[lc];W[ld];B[nb]

(;W[mc]C[[gromit\] W could have cut.];B[mb];W[kc];B[lb];W[ke]
;B[cf];W[eb];B[dj]C[[gromit\] good];W[cl];B[cn]TR[dl][cq]C[[gromit\] bad :(
The corner is open anyway so protecting it is useless, now W will jump into the center where he is strong.
Better cap W off (D14), force him to live small and use the gained strength to reduce W lower side territory.]
;W[el];B[gp]TR[go][hq]C[[gromit\] good idea, but a bit far from the 2 white running stones, and a bit disconnected from B lower right.
Either play G5 to force W answer around H4 and attack the E8 stones, or invade at H3.]
;W[gq];B[hp]C[F4 would have been better...?

[gromit\] yes, H4 probably abusive.
Moreover F4 almost forces W to answer (H4?) and B can keep the pressure.]

;W[tt];B[tt]C[[gromit\] Well B ends up losing by very little.
To summarize, I'd say that the beginning was ok, that R11 was a little dubious but turned to B's advantage when W gave up R8 stone.
That B missed a *big* opportunity when W invaded the top, an M17 (or even N17 as suggested) would have changed things a lot. However B was still quite ok, but when W invaded left side, B missed twice the opportunity to separate W from his lower side group. After W capturing H4 the game could have ended if W had killed lower left corner, but W and B both let their opponent live in the two left corners, to end up in a quite close game (B's endgame being a little superior to W's).

I think that B showed a good capacity to build territory and a strong will to attack, but must be careful about direction choices (whether on the top or left side). Caring about life and death would also benefit to *both* players :)

B didn't leave many weak groups, which is a standard problem around 10k, so I guess B will improve quite fast.

The best I can say is that B should continue playing that way, but think twice before answering any invasion move from his opponent.

I hope this review helped, if some things are left unclear, please ask me about them, online or offline.]
