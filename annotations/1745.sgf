RE[W+6.5]

C[Thank you for reviewing my game.  this game was played on the dragon go server.  at the start of the game i was about 29th kyu and my opponent, Rabi, was a self proclaimed 30 kyu.  Due to the length of the games played on Dragon, by the end of the game i was a 27 kyu, and Rabi 22 kyu.

Since he was new to Dragon, we played an even game.  At the start of the game, i was a little unsure of my opponent's skill.  But it became apparent that he was much better than 30 kyu.  All in all, i think i played well and it was an interesting game for me.

thanks again!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
(;B[jd]C[So far so good, altough it is usually better to just make a huge moyo by playing at Q10.]
;W[ci];B[pj];W[nq]
(;B[jp]C[looking back now, this move seems like too much of a stretch.  just asking to get cut off.  but i think it turned out ok in the end.

Yes, usual moves when you pincer are:

M3 or M4];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[Not the best solution, always try to cut your opponents stones.

Possible variation starting with P3.];W[pq];B[no];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[rf];W[se];B[sf]
;W[rd];B[oa];W[pa];B[nc]C[that corner played out pretty standard i think.

Yes at your current level it was good playing and should combine well with your other stones.]
;W[hq];B[fc];W[ce];B[jj]C[i think F14, H6, or N3 would have been better choices than this.

Perhaps altough taking the point in the center is always big when playing for influence and center game.]
;W[jm];B[lm];W[io];B[gg]C[You are still streching out to much...]
;W[hi];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[qm]C[i felt way too open for attack at R7.

Bad Bad... you left your group to die a horrible death... :P]
;W[lp]C[i should have moved there instead ov R7.];B[lo];W[ko]
C[i think at this point i just figured i would loose my stone at K4.  so I did not fight to keep it. 

You can still use the stone as aji. Or try to save it... white as some cutting points.]

(;B[kn];W[jn];B[kp];W[jo];B[lq]C[but now it looks like i might be able to keep it alive, even if it is isolated.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[np];B[mo];W[ik];B[iq];W[fr];B[es];W[fs];B[dr]
;W[bq];B[br];W[aq];B[ar]C[another standard corner?

Not so standard... but you did well, the last stone is  not really necessary.]
;W[bo]
(;B[cs]C[i am not too sure i had to play there.  i did it just to be safe.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[op];W[fe];B[ge];W[fh]C[i am not sure why white did not connect at P3.  I guess he thought an invasion in the upper left was of bigger importance.  i was glad he diddn't though.]
;B[oq];W[so];B[nr];W[ir];B[jr];W[ip];B[jq];W[hr];B[sn];W[sp]
;B[rn];W[pr];B[or];W[rr]C[this move seems odd to me.

Yes it is odd, altough it assures the eyes.];B[ed]C[i was feeling a bit over confidant i think.  perhaps J12 or L9 would have been better?

if you count your moyo is strictly bigger, you can play more conservatory sice you are ahead.]
;W[ee];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[db];B[eb]C[i was trying to be sneaky and cut in to his group.

That move really does next to nothing...];W[ih]C[but i left myself open to a big invasion.]
;B[jh];W[ig];B[jg];W[if];B[ie];W[jf];B[kf];W[je];B[ke];W[he]
;B[id];W[gd];B[gf]C[if i didn't have that stone at G13, i probably would have played H16 then G17.]
;W[hd];B[fd]C[G17 instead?];W[hf];B[hc];W[gc];B[gb];W[hb];B[ic]
;W[ga];B[fa]C[i had to set up this ko in order to survive.  winning this ko fight means life for my poor stones.

Thats true and you do have some ko threats];W[fb];B[de]C[after long deliberation, i decided on this ko threat.  is there any better ones?]
;W[ef];B[gb];W[od];B[oc];W[km]C[i am not sure why he did not take the ko back.]
;B[mn];W[kk];B[ha]C[i decided that the life of my stones was more important than his invasion.]
;W[kj];B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[gh]C[white should have escaped at h12]
;B[hh]C[by not escaping, he basically gave his stones to me

That was good thinking];W[mk]C[but his invasion cost me a lot of territory]

(;B[hg]C[You didnt have to capture outright, it was a snapback. If he captured, you would do it back.]

That invasion could only work if near the side with some luck...]
