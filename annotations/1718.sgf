C[*X*: (all my comments beginning with *X*: for Xopods, do distinguish from the reviewer's)

Dear reviewer,

Here is a game I lost, even though I was sure I was winning.  It was a very interesting game, with a huge ko fight (that ended up with me killing the opponent in the corner, which was why I assumed I'd be winning), an enormous moyo (which is why I lost) and a cool tesuji to reduce it, although apparently not enough.

Anyway, I felt that I was playing well, and I'm not even really sure at which point it went wrong.  I guess I just let his moyo get too big.

My opponent wants to get a copy of the review, so please review for both sides.

Thanks in advance.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]LB[jc:B][ce:A]
[ck:C]C[*X*: I don't like playing against Chinese.  I guess C9 is more normal for combatting it, but I didn't see anything wrong with this.

---  Since you take black, you have the initiative.  Play your own fuseki and your opponent have to intefere, not the other way around.  For example, a move at 'A is a common opening and it forces white to respond at 'B'.

'C', as you suggested, isn't good at this time.  Making a corner enclosure at 'A' or approach your opponent's corner with the game move is bigger.]
;W[dn]
(;B[jq]LB[bq:C][cq:B][dq:D][gq:E][iq:A]TR[ep]C[*X*: I'm not sure what joseki is when answering this knight's move, but this looked okay.

--- Please see variation for a common joseki.  The game move is too far away from the marked stone.  'A' is better.  After the b 'B', w 'C', b'D' sequence, white can still invade at 'E'.  If the game move is at 'A', the invasion doesn't work unless white has surrounding stones for support.]
;W[ce];B[qn]LB[ed:A][ch:B][dh:C]TR[dn]C[*X*: Tenuki seemed okay, but I guess letting him get two moves in the upper left helped him with the game-winning moyo.

---  Black can play at  'A' with the intent to push white down low on the left side.  That will make his marked stone inefficient.  Normally white will response at 'B', but in this case he might play at 'C' to balance with the marked stone.

When black tenukis here, white can play at 'A' to build thickness on the left side.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[qj];W[mp]LB[np:A]C[--- This is thin.  The proper move is at 'A'.]
;B[mr]LB[ed:A]C[*X*: I figured he'd answer this, since it threatens his eyespace, but he ignored it.  Maybe too early.

---  This is way too early.  Since white can easily run out to the center, this move is not threatening.  Besides, playing on the second line at this early stage of the game is usually an indication of bad play.  Play at 'A' instead.]
;W[fd]C[*X*: The taisha.  I've never bothered to try to study it, since it's too complicated.  I rely on my instincts.  Tell me if I made any mistakes.]
;B[de]C[*X*: Living in the corner gives him too much thickness for his moyo.  I figured I'd lean on this stone to attack F16, but he just sacrifices it, and I feel the end result was too good for him.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[cd];B[ec];W[ef];B[fe];W[jd];B[cc]TR[fd][jd]C[*X*: Swallowing F16 seemed too small, but I didn't want to risk being left without eyes, so I do this, but then he completes his moyo.  Maybe I should have regarded C17 and capturing F16 as miai and played e.g. D10 myself?

---  This looks small, but it is actually a huge move.  Not only does it have more than 10 points (maybe 15) in profit.  it changes the balance dramatically.  After this move, black's corner group is thick, and the two marked white stones are weak.  Black can attack them to gain profit.  On the other hand, if white plays the game move, black's group becomes weak and now white can attack black.]
;W[dj]LB[bi:E][ci:D][cj:C][cl:A][el:B]C[*X*: Very nice for White, but still, White only has one territory, while I have the right, top left and bottom.

---  Can't count the left side as white's definite terrority.  Black can invade at 'A'.  If white caps at 'B', black can use the 'C' to 'E' sequence to live.  Please note 'E' is a tesuji, and it is common in this shape (attach at 'C' and hane at 'E').]
;B[hd]LB[ld:A]C[*X*: Too small.  N17 better?  Or D8?

--- Yes, too small, and it overlaps with the black's group at the corner.  Attack white on a large scale.  'A' is good, and it prevents white from approaching the upper right corner.]
;W[nc];B[pc]C[*X*: Decided to close the corner and aim at M17.]
;W[qf]LB[ne:A]TR[nc][jd]C[*X*: Seems bad by White.

--- White is too greedy.  Now he has two weak groups (marked stones).  Simply play at 'A' to reinforce his upper side group.]
;B[nd]LB[lc:C][rd:A][rh:B]TR[qf]C[*X*: Forgetting about M17 for the moment, because I feel like a leaning attack is better.  If I can kill R14 or chase it into his moyo, that's good enough.  Maybe I should have capped at P14 instead.

---  It's not easy to decide which group to attack.  The marked white stone is easier to live because of moves like 'A' and 'B'.  I will attack this stone to make it strong since it is hard to kill.  Then aim at an invasion at 'C' .]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[og]C[*X*: R14 looks like it's in big trouble to me, but it ends up living.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[ph]C[*X*: Bad move.  Black can cut (see variation).  Too bad I'm an idiot and don't see it. :-P

---  Your variation is good.  White can be cut.]
(;B[oh];W[pi];B[oi]LB[pj:A]TR[jd][md][me][df][ef][dj]C[---   Black should push at 'A' and chase white to the center.  Black is building thinckness with the game moves, but it isn't all that useful given the marked white stones.  When you decide to build thickness by sealing white in or chasing his group to the center, look at the whole board.  Is the thickness useful?  If not, then don't seal his group in.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[nk];W[pl];B[ql];W[om];B[qm];W[nl]C[*X*: He connects out... don't see how I could have avoided that, except to have cut when I had the chance.]

(;B[kb]C[*X*: I thought ko was the best option, but maybe connecting would have been good.

---  Yes, connecting is better.  Also, I have put in some comments in your variations.  Please check all your variations.]
;W[kc];B[ok];W[ol];B[jc];W[id]
(;B[ib]C[*X*: I think continuing the ko is correct.  See variation.

---  Please see my comment in your variation.  Fighting the ko is good.]
;W[kc];B[po];W[jc]C[*X*: White calls my bluff.  I wasn't bluffing, it turns out.  But killing the bottom right ends up not being quite enough.]

---  It seems to me all your variations show white is alive or seki if he plays at 'A'.  Actually, it can be killed.  Please see my variation.]
;W[hc];B[gd];W[gc];B[fc];W[mk]C[*X*: White realizes that there's still a threat of an attack to this group.]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[ni]C[---  This is small.  Saving these two stones doesn't threaten white.]

C[*X*: Too small for sure.  F10 is probably best right now.

;W[nn]C[*X*: Two eyes... barely.];B[hl]C[*X*: Tesuji, baby.  I was very proud of this one, and the ensuing reduction was almost enough to win.  Almost.]
;W[hk];B[hm];W[im];B[hn];W[ik];B[in];W[lg]C[*X*: Slack move by White, I think. It's worth some points, but probably G8 better.  Or M12 kikashi, then G8.

;B[am];W[al];B[an];W[bk];B[fn]C[*X*: Another failed attempt to kill something.  Any way it could have worked?  I don't think so, but I get something out of the deal anyway... connecting two groups so I don't need to play in my own territory later.]

C[*X*: Game over.  Black winning on the board, but with 6.5 komi, it's White's game by 1.5.

Very interesting game, I found.  Many close calls, and some interesting moves.  Where oh where did I go wrong?

---  Move 111 is probably the losing move.  It's small.  At that time the urgency is to reduce white' s moyo.]
