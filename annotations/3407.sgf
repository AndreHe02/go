C[Black: Hello. Thanks for the review. This is a new kgs account so my rating is not stable yet. I believe I'm around 20k. This game was pretty close. I think we are both about the same strength.
I especially would like your comments on how to handle moves starting at 80 where w takes a large part of b territory.

See move 17

Corners are generally speaking moves that shouldn't be played until everything else has been played

;W[kb];B[jb];W[ic];B[lb];W[ib];B[ka]TR[km]C[Let it go and close up your area!]
;W[km]C[At this point the territory is almost even.  White has a better in than black does at this point but black ends up exploiting the corners.  If white had handled the bottom left corner differently as we will see the game would have been a blow out.

Regardless both sides did their best to exploit weakness when they found it... now both sides need to learn to cover their asses so as not to allow for the other side an opening to exploit.  

This is a skill that takes time and practice.  Handicap games can be great for this; both learning how to better exploit weakness (playing white in handicap) and cover weakness (playing black in handicap)]

It seems that black is too weakend in this area to limit whites damage...

I am not advanced enough to immediately see a solution that will result in the smallest amount of territory being lost...

I think both sides need to look at a move and say:
"Is this the biggest move currently on the board"

Both players were playing very locally and not taking into account the entire play area.  This is natural at the level these two players are at and is the difference between someone at 20k and 10k and I'm sure even to dan.]
