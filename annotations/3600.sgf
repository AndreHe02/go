C[This game was played on DGS and I estimate that I spent about 40 hours in analysis.

I have included a few questions and my main thought process. Please feel free to comment on my thought process as well as my direct questions. Any and all comments are welcome.

Thank You in advance for your time!
CTC

Kakashisan:  hey CT.   i'm very glad you included your thought process, b/c that's always a great thing to do.  let's get started!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]C[I have a joseki question after White plays 6. F16.]

(;W[ce]LB[fd:B][ce:A]C[k-san: i didn't quite understand what you meant by the last comment fully, but if you mean w's choice in response to the approach, the joseki resulting from b shown in the variation i provided is played very rarely now, and (if i remember correctly) is now dead in professional play.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]
(;B[cj]LB[dj:A][pj:E][qj:B][cl:D][cn:C]C[I do not understand playing 11 at A. The explanations that I have read state that it makes miai of B and C. I don't see this as an accurate assessment. After White B I see Black C as urgent but not equivalent! After the solid extension to 11 Black scores better statistically (after ruling out apparently inferior lines of play and games played where the winning player was many grades stronger than his opponent), 66% vs. 50%, and the correct direction of play is to approach the bottom left corner from the other side developing the stone in the bottom right corner. What am I missing? Playing 11 at A is vastly more popular.

Most importantly to me, I like the type of game that I get after the solid connection. If it is only a matter of taste I will stick with Black 11 as played.

k-san: let me try to tackle that piece by piece.  first, about the difference between 3rd and 4th line at A.  here, A is always played, b/c you don't have to spend another move later. please see the variation.  but if w plays D here, b not only doesn't have the time to spend another move here, but c12 is a more severe invasion than if c10 were at A. 

as for the direction of play, and follow-up, f3's a big move, but either that or E'll do, but C is wayyy too small, and very slow for the speed of the opening right now, when b has much faster options available.]
;W[qj];B[fq];W[cn];B[ql]LB[dr:A]C[The usual play is at A.
I think White 14 is best but it doesn't place much pressure on the Black stone at 13. I think this gives me the freedom to play tenuki at 15 and to come back to the bottom left a bit later.

k-san: w doesn't have much of a choice there, b/c he decided to deal with the right side, the compensation for b is that his options (and space) is limited after f3. i like the tenuki.]
;W[qg];B[qe]C[White 16 isn't a very forceful move so Black 17 could be played tenuki and the lower side is screaming for a play. I think keeping pressure on the white stones on the left will compensate me for any losses at the bottom.

k-san:  yeah, 16 isn't forceful, and allows b to enclose the corner, but the extension's more solid in compensation.]
;W[oj];B[dr]LB[ol:A][cq:C][hq:B]C[Black 19 seems best locally but as I would be happy if White pincered at B perhaps 19 at A would be stronger.

k-san: i think this is fine, b/c if b gets C, then w's going to have no base whatsoever. this is applying a lot of pressure on w.]
;W[hq]LB[cq:A]C[White 20 seems like a mistake when Black already has the 11 stone in place. This seems to create two weak groups for White. He very much would like to play at A to defend the corner but he also needs to play on the lower side.

k-san:  ouch. this is a big overplay.  B should look forward to taking the corner away, and trying to start an attack.]
;B[fo]LB[cq:A]TR[hq]C[Playing at A seems to give White time to develop his marked stone.

k-san: this is an interesting thought, rather than simply take A, *but*, b won't have any base after w takes A, so it's critical that B get it first. don't worry about giving w time, b'll still have fun dealing with those weak stones.]
;W[cq];B[jp]LB[kl:C][ip:A][jq:B]C[Plays at 23 or A were my primary alternatives. I chose 23 over A because of the White stone at 18. It seemed wrong to drive White along the third line, trading territory for influence with this stone in place to support a play around C that would erase much of my influence with one move.

Perhaps B should have been considered.

k-san: unfortunately, now b has a problem, b/c his stones have no base, so b must be careful. a is the only move.  if you order chain this, it's like w one-point low pincered, and after the jump and c6, b made the d2 exchange, which is bad, b/c it removes the 3-3.]
;W[ho];B[iq]LB[cr:A][jr:B]C[The choice seems to be between 25 and A. Threatening to connect first seems to be the best move as it makes the white stones a bit heavy and more prone to attack. B seems to miss the mark when White plays at 25.]
;W[gq];B[pq]TR[fo][fq][dr]C[I decided to treat the marked stones lightly for the time being. White 26 was completely unexpected.

k-san: taking the corner's too early, i think. b should play e-3, and continue attacking.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[hp];B[ol]C[k-san: connecting at k5 is huge for the bottom right. i don't think p8 is the biggest, or best move yet.]
;W[nc];B[nd]LB[oc:A]C[In a similar position I tried playing at A, mistakenly thinking that I would get sente! As a play at A does not get sente for Black it seems to make more sense to build up my position with contact plays against White's position at the top to strengthen my position in preparation for an attack against the white stones on the right side. If I can induce a passive defensive move by White there are a lot of places to improve my positions on the bottom or left sides.

k-san: attaching at a is bad for two reasons here specifically:

1.) it helps w strengthen the top, there's no b stone already there to pincer.

2.) if b plays A, the corner may have some bad aji.

anyway, you can look forward to attacking the stones below.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[jo];W[eo]TR[dr]C[This contact play appears to let me escape although I may still need to let the marked stone go. If I can still escape this seems like a big loss for White.

k-san: maybe w should just jump out with h7?];B[ep];W[fn];B[en]
;W[do];B[gn];W[fm];B[go];W[hn];B[gm];W[em];B[mk]TR[qg][oj][qj]
SQ[hn][ho][hp][ip][gq][hq]C[k-san: now w has a major problem, i.e. two unstable groups]
;W[og];B[ir]TR[hn][ho][hp][ip][gq][hq]C[After this move I think it is the White group of marked stones that is in danger.

k-san: yeah, w is really feeling pressure and pain here. at this point, b has a won game. all w can do now is reduce from the outside, and get free moves from the sacrifice. but even there, b's still won. great job!]
;W[fr];B[er];W[gr]LB[hm:A]C[k-san: A is the only move. after connecting, b can kill.]
;B[gl]C[k-san: i prefer h8, to make the kill as quick and secure as possible.]
;W[im];B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[km];B[il];W[mm];B[ml]LB[ge:A]TR[io]
[jo][jp][iq][ir]C[This was my idea starting back at move 59. I wasn't able to read this out completely but I was able to determine that I could make life for my group of marked stones while containing the White invaders. The worst case senario, which I think is unlikely, is that White is able to keep connected and to live small in gote. I estimate the loss at about 35 points. I think my thickness combined with sente to play at A should more than compensate me for my loss if this event came to pass. Is this a good assessment and a valid furikawari play or should I have had us both running out into the center because I couldn't read it out to my opponent's death?

k-san:  back at move 59, you don't have to worry too much about reading. w's dead. as for the marked stones, they won't have any problem, b/c w can't counterattack.]
;W[mo];B[lp]C[k-san: i'd prefer n3.];W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[mp]
C[From here on I am certain that White is dead. As killing this group gives me an insurmountable lead, about 50 points, I don't see any reason to court disaster by trying for more and just play to keep it as simple as possible from here out.

k-san: i think w should've never pulled these stones out in the first place, but now that he has, the mistake as deadly. w only has about 25-30 points from a rough estimate (the right side is still open for b to remove the base, that's w's next worry).  i think your lead's pretty accurate, rough estimate for b is around 70-80 points.

as for your plan for the rest of the game, that's absolutely correct. there's a chinese saying "simple is beautiful," and that's exactly what should be applied here.  excellent thinking.]

No laughing please! I think this is my best game to date.

Again, thank you for taking the time to help me improve my game!

CTC

k-san:  *grabs tape, puts some across mouth*
*muffled* okay, good, can't laugh now. i think you did very well in this game.  the big turning points as around k5, b/c b that helped the bottom right moyo a lot, and the overplay at move 20 (h3), which allowed b to invade the 3-3.  

anyway, you're very welcome, i really enjoyed looking through this.  hope you enjoyed this, and found it helpful! have a great day/night!

J]N[RESULT])
(;B[dj]C[this is the correct extension, this way, b can move out into the center more easily, but most importantly, he doesn't have to spend another move here.]
;W[cl]LB[pj:A]C[if w extends, then b will tenuki, and switch to A.  the speed of the opening is very fast for b.]

[cg:C]C[I had an opponent play this against me in another game. This is like a 3-3 invasion with White playing at 6 instead of A.

The cutting point at A seems to be a problem. The best I could come up with was to play at either B or C maybe after trading Black D for White E.

Black C after trading Black D for White E is where I am leaning. I think White needs to make an extension along the top, probably at H, after which I have sente to play elsewhere. Am I even close? If White gets to play at F before I do, G seems forced whether I have played at B or C. It feels like I should get more, but I can't see any good alternatives. Is there something clever that I am missing with a play of Black 11 at E? Is obtaining sente my bonus here? I had sente when I got here and White seems to have obtained more than I have.
Another question:
Is White's position at the bottom left relevant to this discussion?]
)
(;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ci]C[this joseki is very slow for w, and he has to spend another move here (if k17/16 were already there, then it would be a little better, but overall, i don't like this variation at all).]
