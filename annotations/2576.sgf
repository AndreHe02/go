C[my teacher said that we are 1 or 2 k, she is going to give us 1 dan in jun if we pass her 7 handicape game^^


Hello Eric,

I reviewed your game and added my comments (preceded by "ug:"). Since black gained a big advantage in the lower right, early in the game, this was an easy game for black.

Kind regards,

;W[pb];B[pn]C[is this move ok?

ug: It is not bad, but I think other areas are more important now; M17, F17 and D5 all look more interesting to me. F3 is also possible.]
;W[qc];B[me]C[ug: This is to vague - it does not threaten white, neither does it help black very much.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[op]C[white this move is a bit strange...]
(;B[or]C[is this the correct answering to 16?

ug: This is a complicated situation. I am not really sure myself what the best way to play is. See the variation. In any case, your move is all right (and the end result is very good for black).]

C[ug: R7 or S8 may be better.];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn];W[ro];B[rl]
;W[sn];B[pl]C[ug: Good. However, since white lives, I think he should play elsewhere now. The black territory at the right is still open from the top, so white can abandon the stone at R8 for now.]

(;W[qk];B[rk];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[sk];B[pk];W[sl]C[ug: Since white answered black's Q8, black gets an excellent result.]
;B[fq]C[will f4 be better?

ug: I think this is fine.];W[do];B[gn]C[ug: I do not like this move very much. You are trying to make territory with your thickness at the right, which is often not a good thing to do. I would prefer to play in the upper left. Locally, F5 looks more solid (and thus better) to me.]
;W[ne]C[ug: What is white trying to do here?];B[nf];W[mf];B[le]
;W[mg];B[nd];W[kg]C[ug: White is getting himself into trouble ... he created a weak group in black's sphere of influence.]
;B[ek]C[will m11 be better?

ug: I think black's aim should now be to put pressure on the white L13 stones, maybe using the black wall.
How to do this is not so easy to say, though. By playing M11, black secures his moyo below, and attacks the white group. However, in this way black uses his wall to make territory, not to attack. This would probably suffice to win this game, since black gained an advantage in the lower right, but the natural thing to do is to use your thickness by attacking the weak white group. Hence I think black should try to force white's group to run against the black wall, by playing around J4, maybe. One could see E9 as a preparatory move for this attack, which attempts to build up some strength at the right.

In any case, black should keep the weak white group in mind.]
;W[lj]C[ug: Good.];B[ll]C[ug: I would prefer to follow up on E9, by playing C10.]
;W[jk];B[lh]C[is this a correct moveof invation?

ug: This is not really an invasion, since white does not have any sizeable territory here, but rather an attempt to attack the white group. Although this move could prevent white from making two eyes, black should first play from the outside. Now there is still so much space that white can easily run out.]

;B[gp]C[ug: Now the game is basically over; black's center is huge.]
;W[qe];B[oe];W[er];B[gr]C[ug: Too small. There are much bigger moves left in the upper right. For example, C17.]

ug: Yes, of course. The ko is not a big risk for black, but it is very dangerous for white.]
