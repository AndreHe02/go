AB[dp][pd][dd][pp][jj][dj][pj][jd][jp]C[Dear reviewer

I played this game recently On igs againt a 3 dan japanese.There is no komi and i am black in this game:)

This was my first game against such a strong player.];W[pg]
C[Mattias> Hi, my name is Mattias and I will try to give you some
guidance on how you should try to play. I would probably loose
against a 3d player even with nine stones hcp but I'm sure that
I can teach you something.];B[qf]C[I played this move to attack him and To securise the corner,but a friend told me That i should tenuki and play at the opposite to let him take the corner.What would you do in that case?

Mattias> I would try to keep presure on whites stones. In that
way I can try to keep sente. The best thing is to chase the white
stones and build territory in the process. I think the move is ok.]
;W[qg];B[nc]C[Just a question ,is this move prevent from a San San Invasion.If yes ,could you Show me how to kill it if he plays 3-3 point,or if no,could you show me how to live in this short space?

Mattias> No, this is not safe. Se variation. You need to have one
stone at O17 and one stone at R15. Then it is secure.]
(;W[lc];B[md]C[Mattias> This is good. Preasure on white and separate him.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[le]
(;B[hc]C[A slack move i think.What would you play instead of?

Mattias> I think it is ok. It is harder for white to build a base.
Other moves I would consider are L14 or O14. L14 builds
central influence for later fights while keeping preasure on
the M15 group. O14 separates the M15 and the Q13 groups.];W[kf]
;B[jf];W[mf];B[pf]C[at this time my goal was to try to keep them separate and in the same time to get a bigger territory. I wanted to play O14 but as i am not good at reading,i played cautionly.]
;W[og];B[ne];W[nf]C[Mattias> As you see you did not separate the white groups.
You should have tried O14.];B[kg];W[lf];B[lh];W[nj];B[ni];W[oi]

(;B[mi];W[oj];B[pi]C[Now i see this move,i realize this is a big mistake.Q9 seems better to me.What would you play?

Mattias> If you want me to shoose between Q11 and Q9 I would
play Q9.];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]
(;B[qn]C[I abandonned this group because i thought it was already dead,But Now i d like to ask you if it was possible to live and How

Mattias> See variations.];W[ql];B[oq]C[Again the same question:is it possible to live here in 3 3 point?could you show me te the sequence.

Mattias> As far as I know, there is not possible to live att 3-3
without help from friendly stones.];W[lq];B[kq];W[lp];B[kn]

;W[nl];B[kl];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk];B[jk];W[jh];B[jg];W[ki];B[kj]
;W[ih];B[hi]C[What would you play here to kill him (because i think it s possible)

Mattias> A play at G12 had made it harder for white.];W[hh]
;B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[ec];W[fe];B[fb]C[Mattias> You should not have let take your stone.
I think it is better to connect at E16.];W[ed];B[gc];W[de];B[dc]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[fg];B[eh];W[hf]C[Damm the move after i would cut him.what a shame]
;B[ii];W[ch];B[cn];W[gp];B[fq];W[iq];B[jq];W[gl];B[ho]C[Was G6  better?what would you play?

Mattias> Depending on what you are planning.
If you believe that you can chase white so he gets no eyes
this is ok. If you are trying to keep white down you can play
G6 but that will be a tougher fight.];W[go];B[hn];W[gn];B[il]

at F16. This is ok.];W[fd];B[he];W[if];B[gf];W[ff];B[ig];W[hg]

C[It s the end.I finally won by 7 .as i said,this was my fist game again such a strong player and even if i made mistakes,i think i did a good game.We played another game after and i won by 2.

Thanks you for reviewing this game.

Mattias> I think you are a lot better than 22 kyu. Else you would
have no chance against a 3d player. You opponent might even
not be a 3d but maybe a strong kyu player. I think you played
good in the whole game. Just some minor misstakes.])

(;W[qc]C[Mattias> It is a good thing is white invades the corner this
early in the game. You will get strong influence and white
will live small. So usually white will wait to invade.];B[pc]
