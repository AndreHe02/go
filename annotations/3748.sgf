C[JS: Hello Nicholas! My name is Jürgen Suntinger and I am a presumably 6 kyu national Austrian go player. This is my first review I am doing for the GTL and I am hoping that you can learn something from my comments. While commenting your game I've done a lot of analysis for myself, because I am often a player who just feels a good move without thinking the reason behind. This helps me too, especially in the opening.]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[jc]LB[fc:A][nc:B]C[Is this ignorable?

JS: The aim of thie move is to circumvent a moyoplay by white and makes the moves A and B miai. In my opinion one should not attack this stone directly but look how things develop on the overall board, as you have done in the beginning.]
;W[po];B[np];W[qk];B[qf]LB[jc:B][qk:A]C[JS: Here the marked black stone is already loose pincered by the white stone at A, so it should be attacked from the cornerside which also builds up strenght against the black stone at B.]

(;W[qh];B[nc];W[pf];B[qc]
(;W[qd];B[pc]TR[pd][qd][pf][qh]C[did I let black get too much territory+influence? At the time I thought it was balenced out with my territory on the side, but in retrospect I'm not so sure.

JS: In this situation the marked white stones seem to be overconcentrated and still need one move to really secure the right hand territory. So black is very happy to sacrifice this one stone to gain territory and tempo.]

(;W[cq]C[Was it worth playing this now? would making a one point extention at f6 be more worthwhile?

JS: Without  a strong outside position the 3-3 invasion is not possible in this case. It just strenghtens the black corner, because the white stone is certainly dying.]
;B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[dr];B[er];W[ds];B[br];W[dh];B[cf];W[bd]
;B[ef];W[fh];B[fc];W[fd]C[I was thinking about separating the two black stones from the top stones, was this too bold?]
;B[gc];W[ff];B[fg];W[eg];B[fe];W[gf];B[ed];W[df];B[ee];W[de]
C[I personally thought that this was a good exchange. Perhaps it could have gone wrong. I'd like to hear a second opinion on this though.

JS: This exchange was very good vor white. First of all the inital invasion stone of black is not living which is a sign of success in most cases. The second advantage is your great influence in the center. So the black invasion just strenghtens both sides, although he was strong anyway, but you have much better influence now.]
;B[dc];W[ge];B[gd];W[mn];B[lp];W[kn];B[iq];W[fn]C[Perhaps I should have jumped into the center instead of letting black have the pleasure of getting there first?

JS: Here the white center is openskirted anyway, so trying to make territory direct out of it is a difficult task.]
;B[jj];W[hi];B[jh];W[jf];B[ke];W[kf]LB[mi:A]C[should I have played around A instead? As the game goes on, black makes a few points in there.

JS: The move of the game seems to be correct. Now the two black stones are fully separated from the rest of the the black secure stones. So you can cut in them wherever you want because every ladder is good for you. Just try to separate them into smaller groups and play the vital points for eyes.]

(;W[pn];B[nm];W[ok];B[ol];W[nk];B[ml];W[nj]C[I know that this was a bad situation for me. could I have afforded to play in a different way, or was this the only course?

JS: This course is loosing as you see in the variation. You should have haned at Q7 as I have showed you some moves before.]

(;B[mm];W[oi];B[mk];W[ni];B[mj];W[nh];B[ne];W[mh]C[JS: This cut in the black bamboo joint is bad style. You do not really think, that black will oversee that he could be cut, do you? The second reason to not playing this move is, that it gives away a ko-threat which later could be very important in a ko-fight. However black didnt has to connect anyway, because the center group has already two eyes, so black could have ignored this move and play somewhere else.]

[gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[JS: You seem to be a player who preffers influence to territory, which is basically a good idea, but you should not try to hard to get some territory directly out of your recently build strength. You should use this strength for fighting instead. So you should always weight the balance of territory and the balance of influence against each other, which is one of the hardest tasks of Go. I wish you a lot of fun in playing this very interesting game and remain respectfully yours Jürgen Suntinger.]

(;B[ar]C[JS: This is the right move for black to kill white without any trouble.]
;W[aq];B[cr];W[dq];B[ap]C[JS: White is short of liberties here. Here black could ignore the move C1 or A1 because the three in a row are not able to live. However white could play C1 or A1 as a ko-threat, because if black ignores this threat black has captured 3 stones with only putting to more prisioners into blacks territory.]

(;W[ld]C[JS: It is much more important to get into blacks teritorry than simply capture one black stone in the main variation. It is only worth 2 points and doesn't make the white group more stable.]

If you compare this to 6 points for white in the other variation then you see, that the difference is exactly 8 points! But you have to consider, that this sequence is sente for black and the other is gote for white]
