(;B[op]C[In relation to the 4-4 stone i didn't particularly like this move, but it's certainly not a crude move since it's still very early in the game.]
;W[dd]
(;B[hp]C[You might as well pull a little further, see variation]
;W[eq];B[dm]C[Good move, pitty that you expanded on it badly.]

(;W[dj]
(;B[hd]C[The d7 stone isn't secure yet and neither is white's formation in the corner. See variation. Again you could have gone in deeper with f17 or f16.]
;W[fc];B[pj];W[fm]C[Now the d7 stone can't escape];B[fo];W[en]
;B[el]C[msaari: this situation here is something I really didn't handle quite well]
;W[fk]C[Even now, black is still ahead, you should have secured some territory with m16.

Hint: When you're leading (in score), play defensively, attack only when behind.]

;W[fj];B[hi];W[ge];B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[ef];B[hl]C[msaari: I was thinking about connecting the upper group to the stones below and perhaps even to the stones on the left side]
;W[jp];B[lp]C[msaari: is this even near the correct response?]
;W[jn];B[jl]C[msaari: I felt this direction was the most critical to protect]
;W[hn]
(;B[jq]C[msaari: previous move was well expected, I felt this was the best response, trying to save those two stones (in which I succeeded) - M6 might have been a good move otherwise

M6 is not too good, as seen in variation. M7 would have been more suitable.

Saving the two stones however doesn't sound like a bad thing to do, however k3 isn't the move to do this. See variation. J5 much better.]

I like it :) Does the job well and secures some territory.]

No not all. R5 now instead white wouild live. See variation.]

It's not really a ladder, you aren't continously putting white in atari. White still has 1 liberty.]

Yes, 3-3 point invasion much better choice now (although still pretty useless since you're ahead anyways.)]

;W[bj];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[dn];B[dl];W[fn];B[al]C[msaari: last desperate attempt - creating live groups from nothing is a skill I don't have, but I often find I need it. Any suggestions how to improve my skills? Or should I just concentrate on playing better game territory-wise - my opponents often end up holding vast territories, thus the need to create live groups in them to make them smaller.

Focus on influence and territory simultaniously during the entire game :) If he badly wants them, let your opponent have vast territories, just make sure yours is bigger :P]
