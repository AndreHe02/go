C[I was black. I ended up winning, but i still feel that I made some really bad mistakes and was only lucky that my opponent made some larger ones. My questions are mostly with reguard to a couple variation of joseki and basic extentions.

thank you for reviewing my game.

Hi , my name is Neil mclean and I will review your game

The first thing I noticed when gpoing through your game quickly was.
Try not to follow your opponent's moves unless they are urgent. try find bigger moves elsewhere.]

;B[br];W[er];B[cs]C[I felt that this corner exchange, me taking the inside and having a stone on the outside in sente was acceptable b/c he had played in this corner first, but could I have done better when he played c2?

I looked this up using moyogo and it found 2 games on CyberKiwon between strong 5d+ players with this c15 move.

I have sent them to you also.

I would perhaps attach at f16 but it is not joseki,
I really dont know what is best,];W[ce];B[cd]C[black D15 would be possible in a handicap game or to develop thickness.

it was mainly your bad start , the top left exchange that was bad and made weak groups 

you were lucky not have l18 killed.
direction of play - i gave an example of how to time attacks and direction. q7 was very good. yes, white did make some big mistakes.

it is important not to have weak groups in the opening, and to try attack your opponents weak groups to get an advantage , uasually some thickness that can be used to attack later on.

I hope you find something useful to work on.
If you have any questions contact me.
