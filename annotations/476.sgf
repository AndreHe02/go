AB[dd][pp][dp][pd][jj]PL[W];W[nq];B[kq];W[mo]C[I guess tobi is better for white here:
 more strong and simple.];B[np]LB[pn:a]C[what is black intending to do?
cutting white stones?
It perhaps possible: enough blackforces.
However, he should have played security on east edge:  tobi from corner stone on 'a']
;W[mp];B[no]C[If black wanted to cut he had to do it know:
 more coherent with preivous move.
But remember:  "attaching to stones only to strenghten ones weak position."

Here black makes white more solidfor free.];W[lq];B[mr];W[mq]
;B[lr];W[kp];B[kr]C[no need to connect:  better playing on third line  -> making points.]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[ip];B[lo]LB[jl:a]C[this _is_ a good move,
as it destroies black's influence towards middle of game.
For the same kind of purpose,
it would have been better to play tobi from middle board stone:
on 'a'];W[lp]LB[ln:a]C[not very pretty: 'a' would also disable black to cut

allowing capture of black stone,

and rebuilding lost influence.];B[ln];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[oo]
LB[po:a]C[bad move for many reasons:
1- no need to save those 2 stones:
there don't serve any goal; unusefull move is bad move.
2- it is a bad shape:
connecting would have been nicer whith the bamboo knot: 'a']
;W[on];B[pn];W[lm]C[yeap: white shows how weak is black's position.
here the move captures one or two of the 3 stones.];B[km];W[ll]
;B[ml];W[kn];B[kl];W[ko]LB[lk:a]C[no: white should have played once more.
the two white stones are still captured yet:
better playing on 'a' for white.];B[lk];W[ln];B[jn];W[iq]C[very good move:
should have been played earlier by any of the two players.]
;B[jo]C[what is this for?];W[nr];B[io]C[dead angle is bad shape.]
;W[jm];B[im];W[jl];B[kk];W[ho];B[in];W[il];B[hl];W[ik];B[hm]
;W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[gk];W[gh];B[hi];W[pq];B[gj]C[good white move: destroyes black's corner.
But, black's move is very good to:
very much power on middle of board for black now!   why did white abandonned that?
I don't think the corner is better at that time.

White move is localy good. But globaly it looks bad.];W[oq]
;B[qq];W[op];B[po];W[qr];B[qp];W[go];B[ns];W[os];B[ms];W[ps]
;B[rr];W[qs];B[rq];W[ir];B[js];W[is];B[oj]C[good move (better on 4th line)]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[pf:a]C[that move should be played when black
yet has a stone on the oshi on white move's edge.

here, it's better playing tobi on east edge 'a'];W[kc];B[nd]
C[good: white should have played ther first.];W[mc];B[lc]LB[md:a]
[ld:b]C[ouch: isn't black looking for some complication?
'a' looks stronger,
even 'b' could have been played,
allowing black to build nice influence.];W[ld];B[lb];W[md];B[kd]
;W[jc];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[gc];B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[kb];B[fc]
;W[gd];B[ge]C[why not.
But since those 4 white stones in the upper right corner
are still able to connect,
capturing the two black ones,
that black wall isn't very powerfull.];W[fd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fb]
;W[dc];B[gb];W[mb]LB[ob:a]C[dead angle:
not very nice shape.
White wants to capture, secure his position..
 Ok.
Perhaps he'd better play hane on 'a'];B[fe];W[ib];B[cc]C[yes!]
;W[ne];B[od]C[not important stone.];W[mf]LB[lf:a]C[better shape on a]
;B[pb];W[oe];B[pe];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[qf];W[oi]
;B[qg];W[pg]LB[of:a]C[not very nice:
white can connect securely with the bamboo knot:
'a'];B[qe]LB[pj:a]C[no: 'a' or by there is more important.

for securing a very nice amount of points.];W[ke];B[ni];W[nh]
;B[nj];W[mi];B[qj]C[it was time! ;-)  black should have also played there before.]
;W[mh];B[mj];W[om];B[pm];W[ol];B[pl]C[what is white looking for:
he doesn't earn any point but constructs  very secure territory for black.
this is not good for white.];W[pk];B[ok];W[jg];B[qk];W[hh];B[nb]
C[Look now:
why is that huge part of the goban so empty?

:-) do you see it?

One of the 2 players should have played there a while ago!

There is especially big danger for black's hoshi
with that very powerfull white Wall.  
I'm speaking about southWest corner.

It's important to see it.];W[na];B[ob];W[la]C[those are yose moves: it is not time yet.]
;B[oa];W[gi];B[jk];W[ii];B[hj];W[ji];B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[lh]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[gf];B[fg]C[very good from black.
But once again,
all those yose moves are very little money
in front of that empty West Edge.];W[ff];B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj]
;B[ej];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek]C[don't understand:
white doesn't know about ladders? ;-)];B[dk];W[el];B[em];W[ef]
;B[db];W[cg];B[dg];W[df];B[dh]LB[ch:a]C[don't understand that move:
better downstairs to block black's invading.
'a'];W[ce]C[Black is winning here.

you can see it easily:
east edget any group, while white doesn't have much territory.

Things are still possible with that lonely hoshi
in front of such frightning white wall.];B[jf];W[je];B[kf];W[lf]
;B[ie];W[le];B[dl]C[why? this is a lost move!];W[ch];B[ci];W[cd]
;B[bf];W[cf];B[bg];W[bh];B[eb]C[here too:
why capturing?
even if there is some aji,
those stones are done yet.];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ac];W[ad];B[ab]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[cj];B[di];W[bk];B[ck];W[aj];B[ha]C[no:
black has to close the border line on b8.];W[ia];B[ga];W[bl]
;B[bm];W[eq]C[there we are,
a bit late and in the wrong direction imho:

white's policy should be to push black's stone toward the wall,
making some money (points) by the way.

That is, playing around the san-san.];B[dj]C[black makes tennuki?
for the less value move:
half a point.
No,
here black _has_ to answer to white move.];W[dq];B[bj];W[ai]
;B[cj];W[ak];B[cl];W[cp];B[do];W[bp];B[ep]C[Black lost very much points not defending his corner in time:   perhaps is it a 30 points difference...]

This is my first review, and i liked it.

Thanks.];C[Black: 58 + 21 = 79

White: 33 + 26 + 0.5 = 59.5

Black wins by 19.5])
