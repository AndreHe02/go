;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]C[Sarge: Instead of the contact play, you might want to try the pincer or a simple extension here. The contact play is ok, but you seem to have a problem with playing too close overall.]

(;W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[ed]TR[dc]C[Sarge: Eliminating moves like these will go very far in strengthening your game. The move at E16 is pretty much useless; in fact it helps black more than you. The first thing to note is that it creates an empty triangle at D17. Empty triangles are a bad shape and you should try to avoid them at all costs. Before you play at e16, your stones are still connected. If black plays at e16, you can connect at d17, so you arent in any trouble. Again, dont play so close and either attack his stones or defend your own.]
;B[fe]C[Sarge: This is a very slow play by black, you should be able to punish him for it.]

;B[cj]C[Sarge: Now that you let him make that two stone wall below, he can jump up and steal most of the left side]
;W[ci];B[jc]C[Sarge: ditto for the top, he has a strong framework now]
;W[fb]C[Sarge: this isnt really worth it at this point, just strengthens his position up top more while only giving you a few points.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[hc];W[ga];B[jq]C[Sarge: moves like k3 are the big moves that you should be playing instead of g19.]

(;B[bj];W[ah];B[ha];W[fa];B[le]C[Sarge: Black is poised to break into the center, which is all you have at this point. You need to protect it and put your giant wall at p10 to good use.]

Sarge: thats exactly the key. The bad news is that right now, as long as you continue playing so many contact plays, you wont be able to improve much. The good news is that this seems to be your only big mistake at this point. Fix that and you will do much much better. All you need to do is play more open moves. Instead of playing your stones touching, try a knights move or a one or two stone jump. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please email me.]
