C[Hi,

my name is Peter. Unfortunately I don't know your ranking, so I will tell you all things of my interest, hoping you to get me right.
If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq]
;W[cd]
(;B[eq]LB[oc:A]C[You know Shusaku?!
The key to this opening is to get the shimari in the upper right (UR) corner. So if white (W) rejects to play at A, B is glad to do so. See Variation.]
;W[qo]
(;B[mq]C[There's no need to play on the third line. It's too flat and puts no pressure onto the white stone. Better at A. See variation.]
;W[oc];B[md];W[ec];B[cj]C[Good, but the move would've been much stronger, if played from the position of the last variation. Compare it.]
;W[pc];B[nb];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[qg];W[qk];B[hc];W[nh]
(;B[hp]C[The marked stone stands alone. Put him under pressure. Not to catch him, but to take profit of it. See variation.]
;W[qi]C[Too slow. W has to play in the LL corner.];B[qb];W[nf]
C[As before: LL];B[rh]C[Also. Better LL.];W[qc];B[rc];W[ep]
C[Good.];B[fq];W[cm];B[cf];W[ef];B[bl];W[dh];B[ch];W[cr];B[hf]
;W[bm];B[lf];W[ph];B[sk]C[That is an endgame move. There are bigger plays at hand. Think about marked positions.]

;W[ri];B[si];W[rq];B[op];W[il]LB[lm:A][ln:B][jq:D][kq:C]C[Unnecessary invasion. W shall push from the outside, maybe at A or b, leaving only few points in the middle, instead of sacrificing his invasion group. By the way, A and B look at the weak points C and D.]

;W[od];B[nd];W[mh];B[sj]LB[sh:A]C[No! Wrong connection. Always connect first at the nearest connection point, which would've been A.]
;W[rk];B[sh]
(;W[rg]C[Extremly bad by W. See variation.];B[sg]C[That's it. Nice game. You handled the invasion well. But if W had pushed from the outside instead of invading it would've been hard work for you to win. Go through the game again and think about the beginning. If you learn to get profit while putting pressure onto the opponent, you will get greater and stronger positions to work with.
I hope, this helps you in enjoying the game and get stronger.

Bye, Peter])
