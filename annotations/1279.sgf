C[Comment: Andre Bergholz, 2K in Germany, berge on IGS (Comments marked with AB)
AB:  Hi, I'm glad you like my style of reviewing, though I'm not sure I'm the right guy for complicated fights :-). Usually I try to avoid them.

johnmeyer [8k\]: hello
johnmeyer [8k\]: enjoy the game];B[pp]C[RickMott [7k?\]: Hi, please to meet you. :)]
;W[dc];B[cp];W[ce];B[pd];W[eq];B[dq]LB[ep:A]C[AB: Not so good in my opinion, only induces White 'A', which helps White more than it does Black. I'm not a joseki expert, but I would guess there are few if no joseki's starting with D3. I think D6 or a pincer around J7 would be good for Black.]
;W[ep];B[iq]LB[dn:A]C[AB: Better at 'A', then White J3 for instance.]

(;W[nc]C[AB: Big, but I think you cannot tenuki in the lower left. Attaching at C5 gives you the advantage (see variation, the difference between this and a Black stone at D6 is enormous).]
;B[lc];W[qf];B[oc]C[AB: Black seems to like this :-). In this case it's maybe not so bad but still I would prefer attaching at one stone or the other.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[od]LB[pg:A]C[AB: Aji keshi. This move doesn't gain you much, but helps Black to make his corner solid. For instance, the invasion at 3-3 is no longer possible, a high price to pay. Better just answer at 'A'.]
;B[pc];W[le]TR[od][pc]C[AB: You see that the exchange of the marked stones didn't really help you.]
;B[ic];W[qe];B[pe];W[pg];B[rc]LB[nf:A]C[AB: Normally I advise to play safely, but here I feel that Black's play is slack. Separate White and run out with 'A' is the minimum Black should do.]
;W[gc];B[ie];W[og]C[AB: The sequence G17 P13 has a good feel to it.]
;B[dm]LB[co:A]C[AB: Too far, there is a lot of aji around 'A'. But the area is important, your two stones at the bottom are weak now.]
;W[ck]LB[io:A][qn:B]C[AB: 'A' may be an alternative for helping your stones, but your move may be good, too (at least you probably gain some points on the right in case you lose the stones). In terms of size 'B' seems very big to me.]
;B[ch]LB[gn:A][io:B][qk:C]C[AB: Seems unnecessary for the moment. Enclosing the two stones at the bottom is good (a little difficult because of the bad move D7, but 'A' or just 'B' seem ok to me). If not, something like 'C' is big, too.]
;W[ek];B[eh];W[co]
(;B[cn]C[AB: The variation seems to be more common to me.]
(;W[bo]C[AB: This is an overplay. Drawing back is good enough (see variation).]
;B[do];W[dp];B[cq];W[eo];B[dn];W[al]
(;B[bn]C[AB: Bad (see variation). Even if Black can't read it out, this is an obvious case of aji keshi again. Leave it unplayed if you can't figure it out.]
;W[an];B[bp];W[ao];B[ap];W[am];B[fm]
(;W[br]C[I can't kill here, but I can wind up with a ko threat in sente.
Probably the variation is better, though.

AB: Yes, play outside first.];B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[gq];B[ar]
;W[bq];B[bs];W[cs];B[cr];W[ho]LB[go:A]C[AB: 'A' seems to be better shape to me.]
;B[lq];W[gj]C[Aiming to pressure white's group and maybe also separate black's
groups at the top center and top left.

AB: Right idea.];B[gg]LB[hm:A]C[AB: I think Black needs to jump to 'A'. This is the weaker and the more important group. Forces White to make life at the bottom.]
;W[hl]C[AB: Very good.];B[hm];W[im];B[hn]LB[gl:A]C[AB: Bad shape, 'A' is better, but doesn't really help either.]
;W[in];B[go];W[gp];B[hp];W[io];B[fo];W[en]
(;B[fn]LB[em:A]C[AB: Block at 'A' seems better (variation).]

(;W[hq]C[This sequence was a mistake -- could have killed black's group
by pushing at D7.  See variation.];B[ip];W[ir];B[gl];W[hk];B[bl]
;W[bk];B[bm];W[ak];B[cl];W[el];B[em]
(;W[fl]C[RickMott: This is a blunder, should kill with throw-in at G7  The latter
seems to lead to a ko for the group, though, so black gets two moves
elsewhere.  Would you see if I missed anything in the variation?  Am I
better off to kill it (40 points) or keep sente?];B[gm]C[samael [?\]: h7 would've killed]
;W[jq];B[jp];W[kp];B[pj];W[ko];B[pq]C[AB: Big plays by both sides.]
;W[qn]LB[ql:A]C[AB: You could think about 'A', it's closer to your group and not so near Black's strength.]
;B[ql]C[AB: Good answer.];W[po];B[qh]C[AB: Aji keshi.];W[qg]
;B[oo]C[AB: It's better not to attach, O4 for example.];W[on]

(;W[mq]C[Oops, I decide to make my own empty triange to match black's.  Dumb.

AB: Yup, you could have captured. Now your stones on the right are even weaker than in the beginning. Still N7 is a good point for you afterwards.]

the eye, but keeps weak groups from getting in trouble.

;B[be]TR[je][ke][le][me]C[RickMott [7k?\]: Thanks --- I have to go, got a call from my wife.  Sorry....
johnmeyer [8k\]: thanks f

AB: I think Black is about ten points ahead, and the game is pretty settled now, so Black should win. The loss of the four marked stones was the last big one and decided the game. There was a lot of fighting going on, and fighting means there is a lot of chance. If you win one fight it does not necessarily mean you will win the next one as well. I think both of you should move from the all-or-nothing approach to a more balanced approach. Often you can make as many points with a simple risk-free move. Also, study heavy shape vs. sabaki (that's very difficult, I don't get it either :-)). But it teaches you to make the target big before attack and vice versa to make flexible shape and sacrifice when in danger. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to contact me under Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com.]
