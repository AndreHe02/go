C[Cadrach [15k\]: hello
Ebyzz [14k\]: hi];B[qd]C[[lf\] Hello, I iwll prefix all my commentsd with [lf\]. 
I intend to comment for both sides, and if anything is not clear, please get back to me

lefrog06@gmail.com];W[dp]C[[lf\] I have a tendency to always respond to that move with a move in the upper left corner. I must be too predictable :)]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]LB[oc:A]C[[lf\] Here, black is willingly letting one of his corners open (I'll come to this here below). White would have his eyes on P16 or P17, as after white responds to the bottom left corner, as black should logically reinforce the lower side (see variation) and then white can press on the upper right corner. 
No matter what, it should be important for white to end whatever sequence happens now in sente, in order to be the first to play the upper right corner. 

For black, this doesn't seem such a good move. The important thing to remember when playing the fuseki is: play urgent points before big points. 
For me, the enclosure at the top right is the most urgent move. I would have played at A. Approaching a hoshi is not urgent. Sometimes, it can be left out for a while. Making a shimari (corner enclosure) is always more important.]

(;W[hq]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[[lf\] this pincer is not so good, because the lower right corner is occupied by a black stone, but can be played. I would have answered simply at A or B]
;B[cq]C[[lf\] yes, definetly];W[dq]C[[lf\] this is the good direction for white to take. But I do not like the pincer.]
;B[cp];W[do]
(;B[co]C[[lf\] I would not have played it like that (see variation).]
;W[cr];B[br];W[dr]
(;B[bs]LB[cn:A]C[[lf\] THis would be for making life in a life-threatening situation. Letting white play at D6 (A) is not good.]
;W[cn]C[[lf\] Yes, exactly, white is exactly on top of things here.]
;B[bn]LB[bm:A]C[[lf\] White should play the double hane (nidan bane) here. See variations.]

(;W[cm]C[[lf\] the nidan bane is customary.];B[jd]LB[bm:A]C[[lf\] Now white can play B7 in sente, and should without waiting. White can then approach the undefended corner (lower right). Urgent before big.]

(;W[pg]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[[lf\] big move, yes, but not urgent. Approaching the lower right corner should be preferred, as then if white plays here, his stone is backed up by something else, see variations.]
;B[pj]C[[lf\] Good answer];W[od]C[[lf\] equally logical and good.]
;B[pd];W[oe];B[qh];W[lc]C[[lf\] This looks very good to me. However, white is not in the best situation. I prefer black, reifnorcing his open lower right corner while threatening white.]
;B[cf]LB[fd:A][qg:B][qo:C]C[[lf\] This seems off topic to me. Defending the marked stone, pressing further on the white group, or making a shimari at the bottom right would all seem more interesting at this point.]
;W[ch]LB[gc:A]C[[lf\]I would let black settle on the left and threaten his stone at the top, The interesting thing in having the top stone weak is that this can, when black defends it, help white settle his upper right group, which is not very strong right now.]
;B[fc]C[[lf\] This is very good from black, defends K16 and threatens the corner.]
;W[df]LB[hc:A]C[[lf\] I would know what to do. H17 seems interesting too, but complex, and the corner might be hurt. Maybe this is better, less agressive;]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
(;W[de]C[[lf\] This is a strange move to me. I think playing at A would force black to have a shape with big cutting points, probably sente. See variation. But this is not a certainity;]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[cb];W[db];B[eb];W[da];B[fe]
(;W[qo]C[[lf\] Once white has played all these moves at the top left, C15 now seems inevitable.

White appraoch move: at last...];B[qm]
(;W[op]C[[lf\] THe problem, as the variation will show, is that this is not so good for white. The best would be to pincer the stone around A]
;B[oq];W[np]
(;B[qp]C[[lf\] As black, I would push further. Black is making territory in white's influence zone and white isn't making anything. See var.]
;W[pp];B[rp];W[nq]C[[lf\] This is a very good move from white that hurts black a lot. Progressing to the left on the third line would have been preferrable for to this. This works very well with the white stones at the left.]
;B[pn];W[nm]C[[lf\] That shows a good vision from white, not playing the obvious move, but taking into taccount the whole situation.]
;B[fg]C[[lf\] I like this move too, forcing white, and making progress in white's zone of influence.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[dh];B[kc]LB[fj:A][gj:B]C[[lf\] Unfortunately here, I think this is the opposite direction as the previous moves. Black must prevent white from making a huge moyo by playing around A or B.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[kd];B[jc]
(;W[lb]LB[ld:A]TR[cm][nm][cn][do][dp][np][dq][hq][nq]C[[lf\] I prefer playing A here. The reason is that if black wants to pplay M18 himself, thiw will be gote for black. And it is better for white to go towards the center rather than be attacked from here. Again, if black attacks white fro mthe center, this reduces the influence of the marked white stones.]
;B[ke];W[ld];B[lf]C[[lf\] Same as previously, black is countering the white influence at the bottom. White must defend, or risk his stones being lost, so this looks good for black.]
;W[gl]LB[bh:B][gj:A][bm:C]C[[lf\] I see the intention here. White challenges black to capture his stones, and wants to secure his moyo. However, for securing themoyo, this move is a little lukewarm. A would look better. And the sente moves of B and C must be played too. THey are both sente.]
;B[ml]C[[lf\] a good reducing move.];W[nl]LB[mm:A]C[[lf\] THe problem here, is that the natural instinct is rather to play A and secure territory. Will this put the white stones at the top at risk? I think not, so white should play there. Playing here just invites black to wreck havoc in white's moyo.]
;B[kl];W[ln];B[il];W[in];B[hm]C[[lf\] Black is having his way here.]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[gn];B[kn];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[mn];W[lm];B[nn]
;W[mm];B[on];W[ll];B[mj];W[kk]LB[lk:A]C[[lf\] A looks good to me too.]
;B[jk];W[km]LB[hj:A][jj:B]C[[lf\] this one doesn't look good. the expected gain is very small, and it is damezumari for the white group (and will lead it to bad shape in the followup). Black could let the 3 stones be captured and get away simply. at A or B]
;B[lk];W[mk]C[[lf\] Not too bad given the circumstances.];B[kj]
;W[jm]C[[lf\] Yes, worth taking gote for this.];B[ok];W[fm]
;B[fk]C[[lf\] Too bad white hasn't closed the moyo previously. This is a good move from black, allowing to get into white's sphere of influence.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[gj];B[fi];W[fl];B[dk]LB[hh:A]C[[lf\] However, black should think abot the potential territory that playing around A would allow him.]
;W[bk]LB[bh:A][bm:B]C[[lf\] Again, A and B are sente.];B[bl]

(;W[cl]LB[bm:A]C[[lf\] No! B7 is sente!];B[bm];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[hh]C[[lf\] Very good for black. BLack has played this part very well, and with white's inappropriate responses, has taken a firm lead. From this point, black should not lose.]
;W[hl]C[[lf\] White should attack the weaks spots for black, upper and lower right corners or the top left. This is not where the points are yet. It is just sente, and worth 4 points.]
;B[ik]LB[ij:A]C[[lf\] Good judgement. A would be even better. The weak spots left for black are the top and bottom right corners, and the upper left corner.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[ih];B[ig];W[gh];B[jh];W[fh];B[gi];W[hj];B[gg]
C[[lf\] Another good sequence for black.];W[qg]C[[lf\] Attacking the upper right, good idea.]
