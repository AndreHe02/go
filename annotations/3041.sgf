C[[Rich\] - Hi Jose, I'll add comments through the game and put a summary at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[ed]
(;W[ce]C[i find this too timid, maybe a 2 space jump.

[Rich\] - better yet, a knight's move up to the fourth line, white gains good territory, black good influence. See variation.]
;B[df];W[nq]C[i didnt find Bd14 a threath and find it slow, so i feel free to play o3.

[Rich\] - good choice, your corner can go out along the top or the left side, so there's no urgent response there.]
;B[lq];W[qq]C[i usually see players playing r6 with this pincer but i dont feel sure enough to play it, so i always enter at the 3-3.

[Rich\] - This is a perfectly good move - it's better to play moves you understand and can back up!]
;B[pq]TR[ed][pd][df]C[isnt this the wrong direction considering the marked stones?

[Rich\] - With a stone on Q10 or R10, you could say for sure that this is the wrong direction. Midsides are important when looking at direction from a 3-3 invasion, more than corners.

This way his influence counters development for the lower left stone - it will be hard for white to build a moyo now - so it's good.]
;W[qp]
(;B[qo]C[[Rich\] - this is an overplay by black. When white has the approach stone (O3) then the cut that this leaves behind is too dangerous; it's joseki if white jumps straight in to 3-3 with no supporting stones.

See var.];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]
C[[Rich\] - white doesn't need to play here; the corner's alive, and he's crawling on the second line which is almost always bad so early in the game.]
;B[ql];W[nr]C[i think i could do save this stones and damage (locally) B.

[Rich\] - this is a bad idea. One of the first steps to getting stronger, I think, is to know when and how to give up stones. Three points to bear in mind:

1) If you leave the stone and play elsewhere, black will not spend another move capturing it, and if he does, you get two moves elsewhere! It will sit there, waiting...

2) If you leave it, you have the choice of how to use it later. you may sacrifice it to build influence nearby, or pull it out, or use it for ko threats. If you play now, before you know how it can best be used, you destroy the later flexibility.

3) As it stands, you make a weak group. Black can chase that weak group and build a group of his own on the lower side. This hurts the D4 stone  even more.]
;B[os];W[no];B[oo];W[mo];B[iq];W[fq]
(;B[io]C[[Rich\] - Black should extend on the other side and pressure the weak group. See var.]
;W[nm];B[cj]C[[Rich\] - I don't understand this move. A play on the top side or in the top right would be bigger for influence, and there's a weak group at O5 crying out to be attacked! :)]
;W[cp]C[is good to make territory but somehow i feel B playing everywhere.

[Rich\] - This is a fairly timid move. If you want to take the corner, play C5; however, there are more important plays than that. There's no threat to the corner,and black is building up influence.]
;B[cm];W[nc]TR[ed][df]C[[Rich\] - this is the right side to approach.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[pi]C[i think this sequence favors me having an open skirt at the right.

[Rich\] - Correct. A move at S8 would have been better, to my eyes.]
;W[rk]C[i think i play it too soon

[Rich\] - I think so... you're making him build strength while your lower group is still weak.]
;B[pk];W[lm];B[fn]C[[Rich\] - The next few moves by Black should have been more aggressive. The lower white group gets strong quickly.]
;W[jm];B[kn]C[[Rich\] - this peep does little for black, and a lot for white.]
;W[km];B[lo];W[ln]C[[Rich\] - Good shape for white!];B[ko];W[kj]
C[i think im winning here

[Rich\] - Your groups seem stable, and black's influence less than influential.]
;B[dc]C[Rich\] - If black's going to threaten with this stone, he should follow up on the threat if you play elsewhere as you do.]
;W[cf]
(;B[dg]C[Rich\] - see var.];W[cg];B[ic];W[cb];B[db];W[ri]C[Rich\] - I think this is small, only a few points; a move in the centre (around L15, maybe) would strengthen your upper group and threaten the top left for black. Look for moves that do two things at once.]
;B[rg];W[rb]C[[Rich\] - Nicely seen by white, but still a few points.]
;B[qb];W[qa];B[rc];W[ob];B[sb];W[ra];B[ne]
(;W[md]C[i dont think this was neccesary, maybe i should expand at the center with the center group which i dont feel is secure enough.

[Rich\] - Good move; you should defend this group, it's vulnerable. You have no eyes until the O column at least, and a strong settled group either side.

However, butting up against a stone means you both build solidness, and black's is more effective here - by building up you're getting territory at the top, while he's ganing territory and threatening your lower centre group at the same time. A lighter play, like L15, would be better, making him choose between territory on the left or right. See var.]
;B[me];W[le];B[lf];W[ke];B[ie]
(;W[gg]C[i think this is the part where my downfall begins but i didnt like how this part of the board was looking for B so i reduce.

[Rich\] - This was definitely the losing move, given the follow-up; the problem was that it was an invasion, not a reduction. It's a very good choice of game for review - a great example of how, by chasing your weak stone, black can build up power *and* territory.

Go is a game where you can't have everything; you can't take lots of territory and prevent your opponent getting any. Reducing moves (ones that can't easily be cut off, as opposed to an invasion that attempts to live inside) would have been better here. See Vars. - they're complicated, but the idea is you don't make any more weak groups.]
;B[ig]
(;W[gi]C[[Rich\] - at this stage, you just have to read a few moves ahead. If you jump, black will jump with you, and you're heading for his stones below. However, there's a cut you can use... see var.]
;B[ii]C[how weak that center group looks now

[Rich\] - Playing moves between two weak groups is one of the nicest feelings a player can have :)]
;W[gk];B[ik]
(;W[hl]C[is this too slow?  is h7 better? from this point on i lose all rational thinking.

[Rich\] - The two groups are already split . The only hope would be to start a fight to rescue them, or give them up in such a way that you gain points elsewhere. But it would have to be A LOT of points :P

See vars.];B[il];W[im];B[hm];W[gl];B[jj]
(;W[gm]C[do u see a way out? can the left bottom group help this stones?

[Rich\] - Nothing strikes me... pushing with atari certainly doesn't work. See var. for my best attempt, which fails.]

;B[fm];W[dm];B[dl];W[dn];B[el];W[ej];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[eh]
;B[bh]
(;W[ge]C[[Rich\] - Now is your chance to sacrifice the stones and pick up a big corner instead... see var. Even so, you'll still be quite a few points behind. The middle's too big.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[gc];W[fd];B[fe];C[Result: B+Resign

could i have avoid all this things?

[Rich\] - In every go game, you could have avoided anything :) Before you'd given up, you could have pressed at L14, maybe a couple of times, connected at G16 (black has to respond on the left or you play at D15 and connect out) and then played at H16, and had a capturing race with black's thin centre group. I *think* you'd have won. See vars.

However, if you could play that strongly, you'd be, um stronger :P Specific tactical points like that don't help so much as general points, apart from to let you see that there's weakness there, so here are a couple of points that might help:

Firstly, you don't have to save every stone, or settle everything immediately. You can leave non-urgent things for later - did you ever get the feeling that you really wish that an opponent didn't have an otherwise dead stone just where it's most inconvenient to you? :) If you want to learn more, read about 'aji'. It means 'taste', something that lingers.

Secondly, use contact plays to settle weak groups (like you did at the bottom, very well), and not like you did at the top, where black got influence *and* territory. 

Thirdly, much of go is about connecting your stones and separating your opponent's. If you have several separated groups on the board, chances are good that one or more will die. at the end of the game, there were *six* separated white groups, and three or four black groups (the lower side and lower left can join if black wins a favourable ko). If each one of those groups has to spend as much effort making life, black will easily kill one of white's. 

So in summary, don't be afraid to give up stones to stay connected, or to leave stones behind and look to see how you can use them later! 

Thanks for sending a good example of a game for review, good luck in improving!]
