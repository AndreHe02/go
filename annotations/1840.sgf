C[// This is the first game I've played on KGS after I reached 3d.
It was a slow game ( 50 min, 10x1 min byo-yomi ) and with no handicap.

I think you played very carefully and read a lot, therefore didn't make any big mistakes. your reading is very good as a 4k.]
;B[pd]C[black played very well in fuseki and middlegame, but lost in endgame period.

There aren't big fightings in this game, this kind of game is called "Shu Fang Qi" in Chinese, which means a game played in a study room ( but not a boxing room ).  ;-)

I suggest you play fighting games a lot, that will improve your reading faster.]

Now black has about 20 mo on the right side, 15 mo @ TL corner, 15 mo @ left side and bottom side; -- totally about 50 mo, and it's black's sente now.
