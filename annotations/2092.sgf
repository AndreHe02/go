C[I'm not sure where I went wrong in this game.  I let some of his formations get a little out of control and misread a few of his moves.  Other than that I'm at a loss.  If you see any weakness I should work on (Joseki, shape, Life or Death, etc...) please make a note of it.  Also, if you see any major moves I missed please point those out as well.

Thank you for reviewing my game....

JL: No, the shimari is very strong and you should be careful about playing close to such strong stones.

Incidentally, note how white's shimari is stronger than yours (Q16 and O17) because he opened on the 3-4 point.

You could play R16 and Q3 in the opening (Shuusaku opening) if you intend to make a shimari near O17.

F3 seems ok, A or B are options too.];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn]

How can you just leave your marked stones like that?

If you wanted to play a big move somewhere else try A.

B might be a slightly better play than K17.

See alternatives];W[io]LB[dr:A]C[White should probably close the corner first]
;B[cj]TR[fo][fq]C[Shouldn't have ignored his J5 move

JL: shouldn't have ignored D6!

This move still doesn't help the marked stones, even though it does break up the left side (which is good)]

[on][qn]C[these last few moves are really just looking for a mistake from your opponent.

Don't play this way unless you have a specific plan of what you want to achieve

Playing contact moves will strengthen your opponent.

What purpose are the marked stones serving now? Are they taking territory, are they threatening an enemy group, are they making life?]

C[Why do you bother to connect here?

Even if you lose these stones, they are only worth a few points. It is perhaps better to play a big move elsewhere

You group in the lower right is also not absolutely alive (see variation)]

Anyhow, as I stated in the beginning If you see any weakness in my game feel free to point them out.  And once again thank you for your time...

JL: I hope my comments were helpful and not too critical.

A key point in this game was that you did not make your groups safe enough. Try to concentrate on making strong living groups in future games.

Once your own groups are strong you are free to attack your enemy, but with weak groups it will be him chasing you all over the board.

The reading mistakes you made in the bottom right and on the left are the kind of mistakes that become less with experience. 

When you play your next few games try to find the key places in the game where it is necessary to slow down and read deeper than normal to find the move that gives you the advantage.]
