C[Hello, my name's Nathan and I will be commenting your game.  I will try to introduce my notes by initial NA-]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[dj]C[I wouldn't normally have done this, but I felt that if I went for a kakari now then I'd have fallen behind, if I were to have no influence to match black's last move.

NA-Really this decision is not that important in some ways though in others it is.  Either way of handling this situation is generally ok.  It just depends on the kind of game you are trying to play.  The Sanrensei (or 3 stars) opening that you have both played here is a well respected opening.  It is generally valued because it is a very rapid form of development.  On the other hand it is also not meant to build any territory.  Because the stones are high (4th line) and spread apart, this opening does not secure territory but only influence.  This is a decision.  One does not have to play sanrensei against sanrensei.  One can choose to play a different style of opening instead.  It just depends on your taste.  I suggest trying different openings.  Try to keep track at least just in memory of which openings you have tried against what openings and what KIND of results you have gotten.  Not wins losses so much but the charachter of the game that resulted.]
;B[fq];W[cm]C[I felt that this was a bit too far (instead of C6) but wanted to make the gap between the three stones even.

NA-In general this is not considered too far.  In this situation it might be overconcentrated.  If you were to attack black you might be getting a more efficient result.

I think this is a reasonable response though and the result you get seems fine.  I don't think there is too much to worry about here.  You seem to play the opening fairly intelligently which is something to be proud of as this is the most abstruse portion of the game.  In chess it is the opposite but in go pro players spend by far the majority of their time thinking about the opening.

I guess my only comment might be that it seems a more passive type of reply.  This is not neccessarily bad but overall there seems to be too much passivity in this game.  Territories a little too large, walls built with too much ease.  I haven't commented alot of specific moves because of this but I think you can profit from thinking about these brief points as you scroll through the game yourself.  I would encourage you in the future to try to put alittle more commentary to the game yourself before you send it in as in my opinion this helps reviewers to get a better grasp on why you made the moves and to give more concrete replies.

As I said I don't think this is a bad move but another option to keep in mind and try sometime is to make what's called a pincer.  This would be to play at H3 or in that vicinity.  This is an agressive attacking move.  This also has it's positives and negatives but is another option.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[jc];B[fc];W[ec]C[In hindsight C14 might have been better, but as I already had the stone at K17, I wanted to stop black from stretching into the corner.

NA-I think this is a strong reply because of the K17 stone.  Blacks next move is not good because it only makes their stones heavy (too many stones clumped together without options)  Normally the black reply at F16 would be made in a situation where black can extend to K17  but because of your stone there is no room to do so.  This shows misapplication of ideas on Blacks part, but is a good lesson to pay attention to.  You must remember to adapt sequences to fit the actualities of your game.  Sequences from books etc. are guidelines and not rules.]
;B[fd];W[mc]C[NA-I feel mixed about this move.  On the one hand I like the idea of extending here which keeps this group strong and reinforces your position here at the same time threatening the corner.  Because you are making this group stronger you are keeping the pressure up to some degree on the black stones at F16, 17 but at the same time not that much. C13 might have been better.  You make the proper extension though which is also good but you are making a choice you don't follow through on.  If you play C13 you will still be forcing black to make another move to save these 2 black stones and that one move will probably not kill the K17 stone so you should be able to come back to it.  I guess maybe I would say either wait a move or two for this or be willing to trade the top left for the top right corner.  In other words it's no use saying one thing (N17) and then doing another (C15-13)]
;B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[fb];W[hb]C[NA-Defending the corner (E18) would have been much better.  The two white stones are fine even if black gets another move attacking at H or J because 1your stones are low on the 3rd line so hard to get under and 2you can extend toward the corner in sente (forcing a reply) which will give you a good base and then you can extend outward or reply more directly.  As it is you end up letting your top group get hemmed in and also losing the left corner.]
;B[db];W[cb];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[cd];B[dc];W[eb];B[ca];W[ed]
;B[ea];W[be]C[This probably should have been B16, but I had some mad idea that this would help form an eye, forgetting that I'd have to defend the B17 stone.


NA-This move should not be made at all.  You can easily use this move to big advantage elsewhere such as invading the lower right which ends up turning into a huge territory for black or taking the top right, though of these two invading would be much better right now.  Even if black plays B16 you reply at B15 and if Black is so committed to wasting moves on the very small point of capturing one stone you simply let them.  All told replying in top left costs you ALOT.]
;B[ac];W[bd];B[ee];W[dh];B[ff];W[oc]C[NA-Q18 probably better.]

;B[id]C[NA-See all this to here has been quite passive.  You make an invasion but you accept small life which allows black to make walls which reinforce his position.  The goal should have been to escape outward.  You let black push you around up top also.]

;W[af];B[ab];W[nk]C[I thought that I could get away with not defending at B14/13 here.

NA-This move is weak though because you don't get anything.  It is not very theatening because even if you do cut you don't accomplish anything that can't be remedied so you have given up a move.]
;B[ok];W[gb];B[fa];W[jb];B[ag];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[ci];W[bi]
;B[cj];W[ah];B[bj];W[ck];B[gl];W[bk]C[Probably unecessary, but I was worried that more attacks were to follow and wanted to be able to capture if needed.

NA-My advice on stuff like this is to read it out (specifically looking out and following the best sequence.  The Ishi Press book "Tesuji" by James Davies has an excellent chapter at the beginning teaching the best method to read situations.  You can try to get it through interlibrary loan if you cannot afford to purchase it (like me)) and make a decision based on reason rather than fear.  It will be very good practice.  Situations like this are good because the options are quite limited.  If you read out the situation you will know whether you should make a move here or not.  Efficiency is one of the most important qualities to cultivate as a go player.  The most efficient player is bound to win.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[gd];W[id];B[hn];W[go];B[bs];W[ig];B[hg];W[gp]
;B[fr];W[oi];B[nm];W[aq]C[NA- I think in the end this game is not very close.  You have lost by 15 points and Black easily could have avoided losing the group of 6 stones at O13 which would have meant an additional 14 points of difference (you gained 1 point for each stone and one point for each point of territory so if this doesn't happen that's 12 points, then there will be 2 points for the stone of yours that would have been captured and that one point of territory it would leave).  This is roughly a 30 point difference.  I think the biggest reason for this is passivity.  For the most part you just ignored the huge territory black built in the bottom right and didn't offer much resistance to the walls black built hemming you in, keeping you small, and allowing him to surround some territory that should have been yours.  This is a common difficulty for beginners, and one that I still struggle with.  I think particularly in the early game you would profit by following your opponent less and making independent moves to prevent things like the bottom right from developing so large or to make sure you have something large enough to balance it.  The idea of an exchange for example is that you will accept a small local loss for larger gain elsewhere.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment your game.  I hope it has proved useful to you!
