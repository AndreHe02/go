C[Hello, I'm Tilo and play as a 2-3k in Germany. Some general remarks on your game:
1. It seems that you were too fixed to your stones at the top and on getting something out of them, probably because you felt that you didn't come out well in the top left corner. You played several moves there which were not very big so you got overconcentrated. Think flexible! If things go bad at one point, don't stick on it - you can still make it up elsewhere.
2. You tried to develop a moyo in a situation that didn't suit it very well because it was still open at one side. This is ok if your stones have another meaning which justifies them even if the moyo is erased but in this particular case the stones you played were just too slow. Not every situation suits for a moyo. Here too, be flexible!
3. In the end you played some moves which were to aggressive. Don't overdo things! Solid moves sometimes have great benefits.

I hope this helps you to improve your skills.

Good luck and have fun!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]LB[jq:A]
C[Now the lower edge is important - a stone around A would be an ideal extension for black and a good one for white. It should have been occupied at an early stage.]

(;W[gc]LB[cc:A][df:B][fc:C]C[This seems to be a bit off the point. You should attack the black stones, e.g. at A, or seal them in at B.

There is a joseki which leads to the position when white plays C - perhaps you had this in mind. 
If so, be warned: don't play moves you don't understand, especially if they are on first sight unnatural like this one.]
;B[dc]
(;W[ec]C[What about the var.?];B[db]
(;W[qk]TR[gc]LB[ed:A][qi:B]C[Leaving the top left for 18 was a bad decision in retrospect

I'm not sure. Black doesn't gain much here because the triangled stone holds him up. A play at A would only be good if black answers which is not sure.

So it's good to tenuki. But the stone you played can be attacked at B, then it gets weak and could be a problem for you.
So the bottom is in my opinion still more important than the right side.]

(;B[ed]LB[qi:A]C[I think this is not really a big move. It's good that you didn't answer at the top.
The really important move for black would have been at A, attacking white's invasion stone while making territory. It was a major mistake by black to enable you to play above A.]
;W[dl]C[Perhaps a bit loose on both sides.];B[fq]C[Finally, it's black who gets the first stone on the bottom.]

(;W[ge]LB[cc:C][eb:A][ed:B]C[What is the sense of this move? Build up a moyo on the top? But you need still another stone, and it's a flat moyo. So your move doesn't accomplish much.
Locally, A seems to be the best move, securing the edge and threatening either to capture B or to cut off at C.
But I still think that the bottom and the right side are more important now.]
;B[fc]
(;W[fd];B[eb];W[ee];B[ec];W[qh]C[Good - Black shouldn't have allowed this move.]
;B[qb];W[rf];B[nd];W[nb];B[gb];W[hc];B[de]
(;W[kq]C[It is a good idea to pincer the black stone. But your stone lets black too much space - he can get an ideal shape. A pincer is usually played at three spaces distance maximum.
The variation gives an alternative which seems better to me.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[nq]TR[kq]LB[dn:A]C[Now black has an ideal shape, while the triangled group is weak, and the cut at A is possible. Not really a good position for white.]

(;B[dn];W[em]LB[eo:A]C[The wrong side - you should keep the stone separated from the group at the bottom to be able to attack him properly and make profit out of this.]
;B[eo];W[cr];B[ep]
(;W[ef]LB[df:B][eh:A]C[E14 or E12 was my dilema

You want to build a moyo in the middle - but it's still far too open. You can only expect to get something out of this if your opponent fails to reduce it now.
A would have been better as it strengthens the weak group on the left while threatening to build a moyo - so it has a double meaning which is always good.
But the atari at B seems still better to me.];B[dj]C[Now it shows out that your stones are weak. This should have been your main concern, not making a moyo. You are in a very difficult situation now.]
;W[gl]C[perhaps 48 was too greedy or hopeful. maybe F10 instead

I'm very unsure what is best now. This is a good flight move. For the further development of the game it showed up to be the right move. F10 might be too loose, you can be cut.]
