C[hi,
i'm playing white here and will mark my comments with H:

long live the reviewer!

Thanks!
Your comments show some insight into your game and I hope that my comments add some more.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[pi];W[nq]LB[jd:D][pi:A][dj:B][jp:C]
C[H: i don't like this move now, as he is forved to defend in the direction of A where he already has enforcement.
just playing B or inhibiting one of his side-extensions (C,D) would have been better.
by the way: is the high chinese opening aiming at C and D just as the low one?

Nothing wrong with this move. It is one of the book lines for the high chinese opening. The other moves that you mention are also reasonable.
Yes, C and D are important points for both b and w in this opening.]
;B[lq];W[no]C[
If you don't like b's response to this move, you could think about invading at the 3-3 point instead of this move.]
;B[pn];W[jq];B[lo];W[gq]LB[no:B][jq:C][nq:A][nm:D]C[H: after realizing how sad the A and B stones look like, i headed for giving at least C some sense

I am not sure that C is absolutely wrong, but it is not a move I would make and if you are not happy with the position after b's move, you shouldn't have made it either. You virtually forced b to make the move he did. That said D is probably a reasonable move in this position to split b and move to the center with your 2 stones. C will then be weak because it is close to b, but something has to give.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[id];W[pe]LB[lc:A]C[H: was it the right choice, to invade here instead of somewhere near A?

Either point is probably reasonable, but I think it is more urgent to pull your 2 stones at the lower right out.]
;B[pg];W[ne];B[nc];W[kd]LB[kd:B][pe:A]C[H: now i likes my invasion at A because the B-invasion has some enforcement now

There is some truth in that.];B[md];W[me]C[H: all i had in mind here is "don't get cut". would some other move (probaly on another part on the board) have been more valuable?

No,  having invested the stones that you have in this invasion, you need to follow thru to make sure that you keep a viable position here.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[mc];B[nd];W[mb];B[nb];W[ic]C[H: i wonder whether there would have been a sequence where white lives here. but then i would have probably get enclosed which could have been worse than the clumsy-but-open-to-the-center formation i got in the end.

Yes, there would be, and given the cutting points and weaknesses in b's resulting position I think it might be better.]

(;B[jc]C[
Not b's best move. See alternate.];W[jd];B[hc]
(;W[ie]C[
See alternate, lots of fighting possibilities here.];B[lc];W[hd]
;B[ib];W[kc];B[id];W[je];B[lb];W[ic];B[jb];W[id]C[
This is not a good move. saving the ko stone in gote is worth not much more than 1/2 point]
;B[gc];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr]C[H: could black have killed me here?

No, as long as you move first you should be able to pick up one eye against the bottom and you are not so contained that you shouldn't be able to get another by running to the center.]
;W[op];B[po];W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[mn];W[or];B[oo];W[nn];B[nm]
;W[om];B[on];W[mm];B[mo];W[nl];B[pm];W[ql]LB[ql:A][pl:B]C[H: i was so happy with that ponnuki that i seem to have lost control. A is stupid.

Yes, it is like you slipped. B wouldn't be bad.];B[pl];W[ol]
LB[jn:A]C[
This is a small move. If b atari's you can always connect. You already have 2 eyes. I like A to attack b's stones at the bottom and build a framework toward the left.]
;B[ok];W[jo]LB[jn:A][in:B]C[
Right idea, but A or B is better placement.];B[mp];W[np];B[lm]
;W[kn]LB[ll:A]C[
b isn't going to let you cut him here and the peep doesn't have any other meaing as far as I can see. I like A to keep your nose well out in the center. You will still be able to harass b from the left.]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[ln];W[ll];B[kl];W[mk];B[km];W[ci]LB[im:A][km:B]
C[H: i should have played that more early, instead of fighting, right?
attacking round A would have been another idea, hopng to get strong as he tries to get away with his B-group

I really like the idea of A. The game move is good by itself, but you should finish harassing b's group in sente and then have time to play this move.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm]
;B[gl];W[hl]LB[ei:A][hm:B]TR[dn][en][fm][gm]C[H: in retrospect i like A (expanding my upper left corner-territory) better

I like A too, but the triangle wall is weak with cutting points. An play at B might be needed.]
;B[lk];W[nk];B[lj];W[ni];B[ng];W[oh];B[og];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi]
C[H: useless

b should have read out the ladder before he play so many stones.]
;B[lh];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[li];W[mh]LB[qd:A][co:B][cb:C][jm:D]
[jr:E]C[
I guess this move threatens to cut black, but I would save it for a ko threat or something. Better moves are A-E.]

i would be happy to hear that it was just this mistake that made me lose but i fear that it wasn't :-)

thanks again to the reviewer!

You know, if you got even a few points of komi, you would have won, so you did OK.]
