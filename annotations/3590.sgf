C[Nathan:

I thought you played this game pretty well and I didn't see too many mistakes or really bad moves.

The exception of course, is the loss of your lower right group which cost you the game.]

**** this is not the right side to attack the corner? r6 better, is that right?

Nathan:

There is nothing wrong with this move, in fact if B plays D10 after it is known as the Kobayashi Fuseki]
;W[fq];B[cj]TR[cd][cn]C[C10 is preferable as all your stones on this side are low.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pg];B[nc];W[qk];B[nq]TR[ed]C[I'd prefer to enclose the corner at E16.]

I agree, B looks good.];W[ic]
(;B[kc]TR[nc]C[** as i see this move, it would be better to attack from g17, is that right?

I agree, B G17 would be better as it extends from your corner and forces W to play towards O17, which is a very strong stone.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[ff]TR[hf]C[H14 would be more severe but I worry about cutting points.]
;W[kd]
(;B[lc]C[looks submissive, why not M16?];W[hf];B[hg]C[*** instead of this move e10 would be great.....

I like this better than E10.  H13 puts pressure on W's group and expands your moyo at the same time.]
;W[ej]C[looks deep and my first instinct would be G10, but this would lead to a difficult fight.]

This ko is very big!  If W wins it, your marked stones will be weakened significantly.]

(;B[kp]C[I don't like this move.  You create and then are committed to taking care of a heavy group.  If it dies, it is game over.

I'd prefer to harrass the top group with the idea of chasing it into W's areas, which should be enough to win the game.]
