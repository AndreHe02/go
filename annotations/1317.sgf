C[buckyyowza: hello!  comments by Mark Fyffe.  I am currently 5k on IGS, so please only take my advice for what it is worth ;-)  I hope you enjoy this review and find my comments to be useful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[qf]LB[nc:A][nd:B][np:C]C[buckyyowza: though not unheard of, this play is bit unusual. i'd expect white to approach from the outside with a(o17), b(o16), c(o4), or similar. white wants to invade your sphere, but has only the two hoshi as thickness to invade with. after your opponent starts like this, you can almost certainly count on a fight. this can be good news for you if you keep your play solid and geared toward building territory.]

(;B[qe]LB[fq:C][mc:A][nc:B]C[buckyyowza: although r15 is a perfectly acceptable play, i'd prefer a more efficient joseki, a(n17) or b(o17) for example, to aim at development along the top, which does plenty to counteract any gains for white on the right side.  another good choice could be f3, a common approach from this sort of opening (see var).]
;W[qi];B[pf];W[qg];B[ok];W[qm]TR[qf][qg][qi][qm]LB[oh:A][pn:B]
C[buckyyowza: white marked stones are all ill-fated now.  if it were white's turn, he'd have to choose between a jump to center at a(p12), or following up r7. since it is black's turn, you have been handed a good opportunity ;-)  try playing something like a(p12) or at b(q6) to cause trouble for white.]
;B[rk];W[oh];B[pm]LB[pn:A]C[buckyyowza: attaching to a stone is best left for sequences that you are very comfortable with or for tesuji to save a weak group. by thinking of things from white's perspective (aka in tewari), black's stone increases his chance of finding tesuji.  i'd prefer to play the upper shoulder hit at a(q6) now, as it is simple and efficient.  black's play may work, but things become complicated now.]
;W[pn]
(;B[om]LB[qn:A]C[buckyyowza: consider a crosscut at a(r6) here instead. black's stone at q7 is of little importance, and is not in much trouble. see var]
;W[qo]
(;B[qp]LB[np:A]C[buckyyowza: both players seem eager to have their groups broken up into little pieces ;-)  why not consider a play like o4 to keep white closed into the side (see var)... alive, but small and in gote.  your corner claim is definitely worth some points, but side moyo is worth at least as much, and white can choke black's right side group if allowed to extend through here into the center.]
;W[no]TR[ok][om][pm][qk][rk]MA[no][oh]LB[kl:A]C[buckyyowza: here is the reason for playing o4 on the previous move: the (triangle) marked stones only have the potential for one eye, and are trapped behind the sector line between o5 and p12 with no black thickness to back them up.  black can make a big jump into the center like a(l8), but has no groups to run to.  most likely black will get another eye and live in the center, but such play is heavy. white's play at o5 also minimizes black's influence over the lower side and the size of the corner group.  see var on B19 for how o4 could have changed this situation.]
;B[mq];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[rn];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[ql]
;B[pl]LB[pk:A]C[buckyyowza: a(q9) is more efficient at protecting this shape... it only takes one move to do it.  in the game it takes two.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[po]LB[cn:B][dg:A]C[buckyyowza: an overplay by white! now is a good time to start building a base for black's dragon to run to.  try an approach such as a(d13) or b(c6) to start developing a group on the left side.]
;B[lk];W[qc];B[qd]TR[oh][pj][qf][qg][qi]LB[pc:B][re:A]C[buckyyowza: white's invasion will live no matter what black does. i'd prefer to play a(s15) here to weaken the base for white's marked group while still cutting. another joseki play, b(q17), would close white's influence at the top, but would help white to settle his group, which may not be the best choice since his group is thick in the center.]
;W[pc]
(;B[oc]MA[od]LB[ne:B][rc:A]C[buckyyowza: this hane is bad shape, it allows white to easily cut at p16 destroying eyespace and squeezing black's group. black would be better off to counter white's advance by claiming the corner with a hane on the other side at a(s17).  when white extends further along the top, black could jump to b(o15) keep the white groups separated. see var]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[rc];B[sh]LB[re:A]C[buckyyowza: white can connect or live in sabaki with a(s15), and that is black's best play here as well. not only is a(s15) reverse sente, but it threatens white's base more than t12. the long monkey jump (t12) is better saved for the endgame because it is gote and only worth 6-8 points. in this case, it even helps white out quite a bit.]
;W[rh];B[si];W[sg];B[rj];W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[rf]C[buckyyowza: black misreads ;-)]
;W[se];B[od];W[jq];B[cf]LB[cn:C][dm:B][fp:D][mo:A]C[buckyyowza: a(n5) would be a suitable followup to white's play as it puts pressure on his not-quite-settled group on the right side and eliminates some of the thickness white is trying to build.  other suitable responses would be b(d7), c(c6), and d(f4) to take your share of the territory around the LL corner.  c14 is not a bad play, but the timing feels awkward to me ;-)]
;W[ce];B[df]LB[cc:B][fc:A]C[buckyyowza: i'd be more inclined to aim at the corner or upper side because of what happened around the upper right corner. that is, black's thickness is closer to the upper side than to the left so the upper side is easier for black to develop quickly. consider a double-approach like a(f17) or go right for the corner invasion at b(c17).]
;W[gc];B[dj];W[ck];B[cj];W[cq]LB[cc:E][dn:B][fq:A][ge:D][mo:C]
C[buckyyowza: black's last few plays are solid and effective, but a little underpowered.  lets take a moment to take stock of the board:

a) white has two solid corners, the upper right and lower left. the upper left corner is still open for invasion, but that invasion would have little chance of extending to the outside. white also has two (mostly) settled groups along the right side that haven't yet been developed to their full potential. all in all this is worth about 60 points.

b) black has a nice group in the lower right corner that will be quite an asset comibined with a black stone at c(n5).  black also has two "dragon" groups in the upper right quadrant of the center, which although worth little in points are worth quite a bit in influence.  there is also a nice settled group on the left side that balances black's influence.  while this only amounts to 30 points or so for black, there is plenty of attacking potential and very little reason to worry as long as black's play becomes more aggressive from here on.

black now has several options, most of which are invasion. a(f3), b(d6), and e(c17) are nice invasion points to consider. d(g15) is another option, capping white's upper side influence and continuing the nice center moyo black has already started to build.]
;B[cc];W[cd]
(;B[db]C[buckyyowza: see var for the correct sequence.];W[bc]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[fd]MA[gc]LB[ed:A]C[buckyyowza: a(e16) is more effective here.  it takes one of white's liberties and more effectively cuts him off from the g17 stone.]
;W[cb];B[gd]LB[eb:A]C[buckyyowza: the upper side is currently black's best chance for big points. a(e18) is urgent here to prevent white from breaking through and taking over.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[fc]LB[mg:A]C[buckyyowza: black has got to try pretty hard now to get some points. some forcing plays around the upper side ending with a center jump around a(n13) may get black a nice center territory (sometimes called a "belly").  such a territory is very difficult to defend, though! see var.]
;B[ed];W[eb]
(;B[kd];W[lh]LB[mh:A][ph:B]C[buckyyowza: white is not stable enough to pull off this long jump and this area is where black has the most potential. consider stirring things up with a(n12) or even with b(q12) now.]
;B[jc];W[fb];B[hq]MA[dj][lk]LB[hp:A]C[buckyyowza: consider playing this stone at a(h4) instead. h3 openly threatens white, but does not carry much weight. a(h4) uses black's stones at m9 and d10 to reduce white's moyo in this area while retaining a strong presence in the center.]
;W[jo];B[eq];W[gr]
(;B[gq]LB[hr:A]C[buckyyowza: this is too easy on white. it would be better follow through with the invasion with h2. see var.]
;W[hr];B[hn];W[fr];B[fq];W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[cm];W[co];B[em]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[cn];B[bl]LB[cl:A]C[buckyyowza: this stone is better at a(c8). b6 is less important than keeping white out of the center.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bo]LB[dk:A]C[buckyyowza: again, it is more important to keep white out of the center than to push through here.]

;W[fm];B[gm];W[fl];B[hk];W[fo];B[gn];W[go];B[ho];W[ej];B[di]
;W[ei];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[jk]C[buckyyowza: white's position is now very strong, he is ahead by about 25 points, and most of the board is now settled.  unless white makes a large mistake, black has little hope of winning at this point, so i will end my review here.

thank you for an opportunity to look over this exciting and fast paced game ;-)  especially considering the relative difference in strength between you and your opponent, you played this game very well!  your reading skill is sufficient, and your endgame (past this point) is strong.  there are, however two things that i'd suggest that you pay particular attention to:

1) the status and value of the areas of the board.  every few moves, or at least each time your opponent plays in gote, take a moment to evaulate the entire board.  what areas are controlled by white? by black? which areas are still in dispute?  how many eyes does each group have? how many liberties? can any groups be reduced or killed at this time?  don't take too long on it or stress your brain too hard ;-) but you could benefit from paying more attention to these details.

2) thickness.  white had a slightly better handle on what groups influence which parts of the board in this game, and that is what made all the difference.  a good way to start thinking of thickness a little more naturally is to ask yourself "where can my weak groups run to?"  if you take some more time setting up bases earlier in the game, you'll find that your battles are easier to win later on.  a rule of thumb: if you'd like to invade an area, but have nowhere to escape to, don't invade.  i've tried to focus most of my comments throughout the game on thickness, i hope they are effective at illustrating this important concept.

thanks again for this opportunity, i always enjoy a chance to review a good game.  please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or difficulty reading the game.  you may reach me via email (mark@accessidaho.org), or look for "bucky" on IGS.]
