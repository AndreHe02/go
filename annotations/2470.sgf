C[This is my second game at the 8k level on IGS.  I'm Black.

I'm Dan Sweet
daniel@danielsweet.com

I've recently been playing more for territory but sometimes feel like I develop too slowly.

I'd appreciate any comments on this game.

Thanks

DRS: Hi, I'm Dan Stromberg, KGS 3 kyu.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]
;B[cn]C[DRS: FWIW, my teacher would like E17 or E16 before this move.  Are you familiar with kombilo?  It's great for studying the frequency with which pro's make various (opening) moves.]
;W[gp]C[I don't really ever know how to respond to this move

DRS: This is a strange move.  Given that it helps W's corner so little, perhaps a 3-3 invasion would be a good way to punish it.]
;B[dj];W[df];B[ec];W[ci]C[not sure how to respond to this

DRS: when stone attaches stone (this is "a little bit" of an attachment), extend.  In this case, if you play C10, you end up with C6 ideally placed, and if W plays D11 similarly, W ends up overcontrated and D14 is too high.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[cj];W[bi];B[bj];W[cg];B[gi]C[also considered J16 ?

DRS These stones are fine, and W isn't that weak anymore.  I like R10 - at the midpoint of the widest area.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[nq]C[looking back i feel like i should have gone E7 and then jumped into C3

I didn't want him to strengthen this lower side much more though so wanted to break it up a little first...any thoughts on timing of this?

DRS: E7 maybe doesn't help that much. B5 protects the cut, and opens W's corner.  I like this move.  Diving for the 3-3 can be expected to damage B's middle left group - sure, you can run, but it's nice having a base.]
;W[lq];B[no]C[I'm not sure if this is good or not here.  The usual play is muddled by the presence of G4.  But if you dive for the 3-3, W gets a wide area.  I've chosen this kind of move, just like you've played here before, but not on a pro's advice - just muddling through.]
;W[pn];B[kp];W[mp]C[this moved really stumped me--yet another one of those its not joseki but it really screws me up moves.

(;B[pr]C[DRS: According to a Piotr article I read, this is most likely just going to make you heavier.  I believe it was a "what's so bad about that move" column.]
;W[mm];B[qq]C[felt like W prob shouldn't have let me get this point

DRS: Not that bad for White.  B is shut in, and W is swallowing L4.]
;W[qp];B[rq]C[maybe now should have switched to H3 or H5...but this is sente so its cool?

DRS: Sente is contextual.  A move is sente only if it is part of a sequence that ends with you ready to start another sequence elsewhere.  A move that is absolute sente in the endgame, often isn't remotely sente in the middle game, and a strongly sente move in the middle game is most likely not sente in the opening.  I don't think this move is necessary, but if it were a move that protected the L&D of your corner while at the same time creating a sente endgame move, that would be a good combination.]

;W[nc];B[qh]C[I like R13 better.  It helps Q16 more, and since it is a bit of a long start on a shimari, W is forced to choose between making the 3-3 invasion the long start (long keima) almost asks for, and making an ideal extension from W's wall in the LR.]
;W[kd];B[qk]C[was this a good move--i don't want W extending and making big territory on the right side but it seems a little slow based on what W is later able to make of the top side....
H17 or J18 instead?

Q 18--not sure that'd be safe wit hsuch a wide extension to R12--corner might still be vulnerable?

DRS: I like this.  W's wall, which used to look powerful, is beginning to look attackable, starting with N6.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[was this the wrong direction...i always see people better than me play a sequence following this that goes somethign liek W Q18, B R16, W S18...

is that only when the surrounding situation is different than this one?

Why would W choose that sequence over the more traditional thing he plays here?  Only when he doesn't have something liek the L16 stone already in place?

DRS: Usually we want to block on the wider side.  This move gives W a choice]

Whats better at this point?

a peep like L14 followed by this? could i have invade at L18? C8 has seemed somewhat important for a while--I've also got my whole heavy group in the center to deal with.  But I did a rough count before this move and felt like i needed to play aggressively...K17?

DRS: At this stage, I like moves that help you, while they are also sente against a somewhat weak group, like: B15 (threatens an eye stealing tesuji), S16 (threatens to kill).  It may be premature endgame, but that's what I would do - especially B15, because the UL isn't all that strong with so many nearby white stones.]

C[I've been tryign to take a little more time to think in the endgame..

I was happy to find this "sente" sequence...however it doesn't really seem like "sente" as he could just let me have the one stone and take "sente" elsewhere right?

DRS: Some books say that 1 point in sente as equal to 2 points in gote.  This appears to be 1 point in sente.  At a quick glance, I believe there's also at least 1 2 point in sente move.]

DRS: Agreed.];B[on];W[om];B[po];W[qo]C[i was debating how to do this...i feel liek what i played was a decent sequence in sente but not sure if a better one exists?

;B[da];W[eb]C[W E19 would have been fine too right?

DRS: E19 is a ko in Black's favor.];B[ea];W[fa];B[ca];W[fc]
;B[kg];W[lg];B[sf]C[this trips me up..why play this versus T 15...sente versus gote right.  playing this way gives white one more point of territory which i make up for by playing at D8 and also making one point in gote..so we're even right?

I could jsut as well have played T15 in gote?

DRS: I think this has to be looked at in the context of the other moves on the board.  O1 appears to be two points in double gote.  E1 is 1 point in sente, but it's your privilege, but then it has a 1 point sente followup.  D8 is 1 point in double sente (I'm simplifying) with 1 point sente followup with a 1 point gote followup.  F11 is but a half point, but it has an interesting followup if you can get J13 and E13 - but that's trying to sneak up, usually not the best idea.  This (T14) is potentially double gote, but if you're lucky, it'll be sente.  Then there's M16, which is one point in gote.  It's good to look at each end game move, estimate what it's worth, and pick the biggest one.  Sente and extra followups are good.  Big gote can be good too, but you may lose something sente in the process, especially if there are double sente points on the board.  I think D8 is probably biggest here, and you don't need to worry about W T14 much as it's gote.]
;W[se];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[ms]C[W does the same thign here? is that good or why do it?

would a W sente push at N11 first be a better choice for him?

;B[tt]C[i missed one point by playing at B8 i saw later.

So basically I lost by the komi.

Itseems like my invasion into the lower right and not knowing how to deal with his "non-joseki" response kind of got me off balance and left me with a heavy group to manage later.

I also didn't seem to have any very effective ways to combat W's devlopment in the top center of the board.

My getting into time trouble combined with the trouble G18 created for my H15 stone was also somewhat of a disaster and came back to haunt me later.

Whether or not it was actually a well played endgame --it was pretty good for me.  I'm finding the 8k players on IGS often seem to be better than me at the endgame.

The around C6 is also dissatisfactory...i didn't want to play out he normal joseki moves and give W such a powerful high position as i wanted to retain the 3-3 invasion option--was there a better way to deal with this?

What seem to be my biggest weak points?
