;B[pc]C[B: i am B, W usually gives me 2 stones.

----------------

Hi! I hope I can give you some hints :)];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]C[B: ?

-----------

Normal move...];B[pd];W[qf];B[re]C[B: seemed small, but...

--------------------------------

no, you have to play there. It's big!];W[pj]C[Instead of q10, I would prefer a move in the lower right corner.]
;B[dp]C[B: should i have gone to the LR corner?

-----------------------------

Both are good moves, I think.];W[pp];B[dd]C[B: because he's got lots of outside influence]
;W[gp]C[B: no idea how to do anything to this stone];B[dn]C[This is a fine answer :)]
;W[jp];B[np]LB[lq:B][nq:A][qq:C]C[B: this didn't work out well

I think this is a bad move, choosing from BA, BB, BC would have been better.]
;W[pn];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr];B[nn]TR[np]C[B: i thought about m3 but i didn't want to build on an open skirt...

----------------------------

Making a base may still be best, but since the marked stone is high, running seems to be the natural thing to do.]
;W[lq];B[pm];W[qm];B[lp]C[B: ithought his group was already ok, so no problem strengthening it.  but that turned out to be wrong later.

------------------------------------------------

But you couldn't know about that right now :)];W[mq];B[kp];W[kq]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[ql];W[pl];B[om];W[qn];B[pk];W[ol];B[ok];W[nl]
;B[nk];W[nm];B[on];W[qk];B[ml];W[mm];B[lm];W[rl];B[mn];W[ql]
;B[ll]C[B: awful.  for some reason i didn't want to play m9.  this really hurt later.

-----------------------------

Again: At this point, it's impossible to say what will happen later on... M8 look like good shape to me :)]
;W[fc];B[jd]LB[cf:A]C[B: seemed good to extend from the right

----------------------

Isn't this the wrong direction? The joseki in the upper right is a territory oriented one, so... I would prefer a move at A.]
;W[cf];B[fd]C[B: I would E15 now.

-------------------------

d14, maybe?];W[gd];B[fe];W[cc];B[ec];W[cd];B[gc];W[me]C[B: i thought this was just big, not urgent, right?  maybe i should play n17 now.

----------------------

N17 doesn't look right... there would be still holes in the black position.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[ck]LB[dh:B][cj:A]C[B: i just wanted to ruin the left side.

-------------------

A? B?];W[bh];B[eq]LB[cq:A]TR[bh]C[Very big. As White I would have invaded at A instead of the marked stone.]
;W[mc];B[ld]C[B: is this good?

---------------

I can't see the point of it :)];W[md];B[ge]LB[hc:A]C[B: necessary?  i was afraid he'd f17.  maybe i should s14

-----------------

S14 is very big! Locally, BA was also possible?!];W[co]C[White tries to hard here...?!]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[cn];W[bn];B[bq];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[aq]
;B[bk]C[good move!];W[cq];B[br];W[cr];B[ar];W[ap]
(;B[do]C[I think White is dead if Black plays at A instead? (See Variation)]
;W[bo];B[bm];W[bs];B[an]C[There is no need for this move.];W[as]
;B[er]LB[op:B][qp:D][rp:E][nq:A][or:C]C[B: maybe i should have waited.  i regret not being able to attack on the right now.

--------------------

Yes... White is in no danger, and if there is some future danger, he can still connect with WA, BB, WC. If Black cuts at D then, White will give way with E.]
;W[br]C[D1 is better for White here?!];B[dh]C[B: it was either here or h6.   now this seems pretty wrong.

-----------------------

Why? D12 is big...];W[hn];B[hm]LB[hl:A]C[This doesn't look right.... is there anything wrong with the normal move at A?]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[im];B[hl];W[jn];B[jk];W[kf]C[B: uh oh.  now it all depends on making points in the center...

Is that so? Please think about moves like m17 and s14 - can White destroy as much points in the center with one more move?!

Please bear in mind that a move like s14 creates black territory AND destroys white territory!]

;B[hh];W[ig];B[hf];W[fm];B[il];W[fl];B[fk];W[ek];B[el];W[rf]
C[Very very big....];B[db];W[cb];B[hq];W[gq];B[gr];W[ko];B[kn]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[io];B[ln];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[ik]C[B: ugh.  lost sente]
;W[rc];B[qd];W[jb];B[jr];W[ir];B[hr];W[iq];B[is];W[kr];B[jc]
LB[sf:A]C[I think White would have answered BA?!];W[se];B[sd]
;W[sf];B[rd];W[ob]C[Terrible for Black :(];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb]
;W[pa];B[ra];W[ib]C[B: this was a gift

----------------

Yes :) White is ahead, so he should play normal moves.];B[kb]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gb];B[fb];W[bi];B[sb]C[B: to stop the ko];W[lb]
;B[ka];W[ic];B[ja]C[B: awful, awful, i paid for this later.  should just l17 right?

-------------------

L17 looks indeed better :)];W[nj];B[mj]C[B: i thought this was a little better]
;W[oj];B[mi]C[nice idea!];W[mk];B[lh]C[good thinking by Black :)]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[lj];B[li];W[lg]C[B: n13 almost works for me now, but not quite, because of k19]
;B[ki];W[nh];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[ci];B[di];W[da];B[ea];W[ca]
;B[lc];W[mb]C[in the end, W+8.5

This was an interesting game! I don't understand it too well, but obviously, Blacks failure to kill White in the lower left corner made the game very difficult for him. I also objekt the single  minded way Black concentrated on making territory in the center.... But all in all, White had a hard time :) The way Black played his attack in the lower left and the black moves in the right center were something to see :)

Good luck with your next games!])
(;B[bo];W[ao];B[bm]C[I don't see a way for White to live.]))
