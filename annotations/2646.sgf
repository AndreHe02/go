C[Dear  Reviewer,



I played this game with White on KGS and lost by 10.5 points, allthough it

didn't feel this way during the game. The game has no fighting scenes in it, so

win or loss depends on size assessment - I must have played some small moves

when there were bigger ones. There must be huge positional blunders on my

part, given the fact that my opponent missed so many chances later in the game.

Maybe by your experience, you could point out the most drastic ones to me.



Many thanks,

Christoph

KKMD:  I would say your biggest mistake were 46 at Q14 and 54 at 013, or at least the idea behind the moves. As you say, there is a general problem of size assessment, sometimes you should simply count.]

C[KKMD: This move is not usual, since it is not well-balanced with any of your corners.]
;B[jp];W[pj];B[qm];W[jj]C[I always found it hard to play against the tengen. Trying to give Black a hard time.

KKMD: OK, but be careful about territory, black is already ahead.]
;B[bd];W[cn]LB[cc:A][ch:B]TR[bd][cf][di]C[KKMD: A is big too, and you need to make territory. Besides, the marked black formation on the left has a weakness around B, and your move allows black to fix it.]

(;W[en]LB[ck:C][dk:B][fp:A][cq:D]C[KKMD: This is usually a good idea when dealing with a black moyo on the bottom to play this move. In this case, I'm not sure, since the usual continuation A-B-C is not suitable because of the D11 stone. So, as white I would rather play D.]

(;W[hj]LB[cc:B][pf:A]C[probably better played at the edge of the board, but looks big.

KKMD: I like your third proposition, A. B is still doable too.]
;B[qf]C[OK now Black gets territory on the right side.

KKMD: He will probably get some, yes, but you went too easy on him.]
;W[pf]LB[qe:B][of:A]C[KKMD: No. You want to attack R14, but Q14, as an attachment, strengthens it. I understand you want to build the top side, but to do this the move would be A ; I think that would be a possibility in this position. A natural move would be B, with the standard attacking joseki following.]

(;B[qj]C[he could have even further reduced me with O13.];W[ng]
LB[qi:A]C[KKMD: This is probably bad direction. You give black to much territory, and you don't use your P10 stone. I think you should play A instead, and try to keep black groups separated. If you can't, then OK, you can be happy with a large reduction, anyway anything is better than just throwing this stone to garbage.]

;B[rr];W[pq];B[qp]C[KKMD: I count about 73 points for black, and you have  about 15 points in the bottom and the bottom left, so you need nearly 60 points on the rest of the board. I think C17 would still be a good start.]
;W[gi]C[probably the most obvious blunder, just look at Blacks response.]
;B[hd];W[gf];B[gc];W[ic]C[with territory in mind.

KKMD: If black now lives, you will only have ~35 points in the upper right, so you would still need points in the center, and considering black would probably make points in the upper left, I don't think you can win this way. I think you should put your last hopes in the killing. Then again, I saw you played this game rather fast, so you may have not realized that.]
