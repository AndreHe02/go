C[I played White in this game and lost by 8 points. This was a very enjoyable game for me in that it felt like both of us were really giving it all we had. I felt it would make a good review because I was really focusing on giving my moves purpose when I played them. I will try to give comments in relation to my frame of thought on some key moves to help you review this game.

Thanks for your time and help,
Talaer

M: Hi there.
 I hope you enjoy the review. I will start all my comments with M: (for matt) so they are easily distinguishable from yours. Please excuse my poor spelling :) and remember I am only kgs 5k ^^

(;W[rd]C[M: this move is odd, see the variations for more common options.]
;B[qh]
(;W[pi]C[M: This move give black a choice between two rather nice looking options. 

 The variations on the previous moves show options you had open to you.]

(;B[ph];W[of]C[Here I know I can settle when I want with R17, so I use this group to keep his group weak.

M: You have two weak groups and black has 1 so black should be happy. whichever you defend, the other will be in trouble.]

(;B[oh]C[M: Fortunately for you  black moves out very slowly]
;W[nj];B[nl]
(;W[qc]C[Since his R12 group can no longer connect in one move, I opt for settling one weak group. Also I feel this serves as a potential attack against the Q16 group later.]
;B[nf]C[He seems to gain the connection that I thought he could not with this move, perhaps I should have run out one more time.

M: Running out looks better black doesn't seem to have time to play R17 anyway now his P12 stones are looking so heavy (see variation).]
;W[oe];B[mh];W[ni];B[nh]
(;W[nk]C[M: I don't understand this move. You are connected to Q11 already your main job should be getting eyeshape. As there is none down the side you need to jump into the center where there is space.]
;B[ne];W[ec]C[I feel he can't harshly attack me enough now in one move so I take one big point.

M: M10 is severe see variation]
(;B[ml];W[lj];B[fp];W[dn];B[ip];W[jc]C[Extension from enclosure while pressuring his group, hopefully removing some of the value of its influence.

M: now you have M10 in place this is big should be easy to see now that M10 was the key point earlier.]
;B[ci]C[Seems bold but not unplayable, I use it for solid profit in the meantime.]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[ek];B[ei];W[od]C[Starting to launch attack against his group, perhaps I should have pushed FROM my weak group, rather than letting him lean against it.

M: agreed :) that could also stop E11 from helping out with the N12 group]

(;W[kg]C[M: Moves like this should come after getting safe, blacks roup looks like it can manage by itself now.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr]
(;B[kq];W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[pm]C[I think I should have followed up this sequence with R9 and taken the possible gote, seeing as how he was able to gain the vital connection for his group later through this area.

M: Its probably best not to play this at all. you have gained a few points but your two stones have been haned on both sides. You have also made blacks territory stronger stopping moves like S8 which works well in conjunction with a probe at S4.]
;W[dh]
(;B[di];W[ch];B[eh]
(;W[df]C[I think B12 here would be better.

M: agreed :)];B[bh]C[He takes B12 instead,  forces me into bad shape, and practically ends the attack.]

(;B[pk]
(;W[ok]C[M: see variation];B[qk]
(;W[oi]C[Now he has the S10 connection that I did not see available to him. 

M: Connecting with a bamboo jont is better nine times out of ten. Except in semeia (liberties) and late endgame (ko threats to disconnect). Although in this case you have to be careful of the sequence given in the variation to connect.]

M: I hope my review has been helpfull. If you have any questions feel free to email me. Your analysis of your game was pretty good and you seem to know where most of your mistakes were I hope the other ones I have pointed out will be of use.
