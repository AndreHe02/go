C[My name is Tim and I go by Talaer on KGS. Currently my rank is fluctuating a bit, but I'm somewhere around 2-4k on there (even though right now it says 1k). I'll look over this game and give comments where I can. Hopefully they will be helpful for you. If you ever want to play or talk, try to find me online on KGS. I am online pretty frequently.

Thanks!

PS - I very much apologize that this review has taken so long. I usually get them done same-day, but between the holidays and food poisoning I recently acquired, I've been a bit busy. :)

Hi,

I've submitted this game because it was an, for my style, unusual one. There was no serious fighting going on, so the game centered on peaceful reductions and tradeoffs and I ended up winning by half a point.
So, what I'm looking for is some comments on where I could have played more effective moves and, also, where the moves I played were particularly good ones. I sometimes have a hard time distinguishing between a move that is too small or counterproductive, and one that does its work quietly and without a fuss, and it becomes particularly evident in a game like this.

I played as white.

C[** I did a pattern search for this on gobase.org and it did not come back with any results. I believe this move when B is on a 3-4 point is not as good. I did get matches for both A and B though. You'll find W more often plays this way when B is on the 4-4 point instead and cannot easily secure the corner.

-----------

So far it's usual fuseki stuff.];B[jc]C[** I agree. It would seem B would rather harass your W stone on the right side. I do not know a lot about fuseki, but I know typically if on one side both players are already down on the 3 line that it is usually an 'uninteresting' spot to play. Here he doesn't seem to threaten anything, nor make a moyo, or really much of anything else.

--------

But this one baffled me. Extending from the low side of a komoku towards the low side of another komoku seemed too small.]
;W[cf]C[But I had to prevent him from turning that komoku into a shimari, so I opted to extend towards that one rather than take territori in front of the shimari.]

(;W[ef];B[kp];W[qe];B[qj]
(;W[gc]C[** I'm honestly not sure about this myself. Something about it feels wrong to me though. I think it is because of what you've said. You are spurring a weak group of your own in order to induce his to devalue your shimari and become stronger. His corner cannot be attacked very harshly. Again E14 hurts you here because he can play B14 and you can't block with B13 as you would like to. If we look at you pushing from the other direction, I'm not sure which player is getting more, but it seems like W has a better chance of developing points.

-----------

I'm a bit unsure about this one. I played it to calmly keep him from connecting at G16 and getting a large corner.
It provoked an extention towards my shimari though. Even though he had already prevented me from making the ideal extension from the shimari, I'm not sure if that was too steep a price to pay.]
;B[mc]C[And this is where the game started to look unusual. I rarely play games that get this far without any fighting or center focus at all. So I was a bit lost as to where I should go next. I considered extending towards the middle, extending from my hoshi corner, but I ended up extending towards his shimari.]
;W[cm]C[This is actually a nice move. If B was instead allowed to play C8, he would be threatening to invade your position as a followup and therefore be developing his shimari area in sente. This is a good multi-purpose move. The balance of the game still also feels strange to me, but I feel W has a bit more control over it than B does.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pq]C[** This feels a bit slow to me. It seems to encourage B to strengthen his R10 stone while threatening to go under the territory that you try to develop here. A hoshi stone is very versatile and you shouldn't worry about it becoming de-based unless it is also surrounded on the outside. You should use this move to instead strengthen your corner more, and put pressure on his R10 stone.

----------

Another move that I'm not so sure of. The normal move would be R6 I think, but that would leave my two stones in the corner looking kind of weak if he decided to go into the corner at R3]

[hs][is][js][ks]C[Very close game. It seems it came down to your ability to get some points in the center which helped your score pretty significantly. That, and the seki at the end. I think earlier in the game there should have been some more aggressive moves, because everything basically settled out very quickly and there was not much attacking or anything to be done. Maybe a reduction of the bottom side before B secured it would have been the keypoint to get a better point advantage, but I'm not sure. I apologize again for the timeliness and quality of this review. If you ever want me to look at something else, just find me on KGS as the name Talaer.

Thanks,

(;W[lc];B[gd];W[le]C[After this, B can still be invaded at H17. If he plays low at G17 instead, then his position will be flat and you will be able to build influence across it. So, this seems likely to be better.]

(;W[df]C[** After this, you end up with a typical joseki shape on this side. B usually plays F17 after this move, which obviously feels bad here given the position otherwise.  I think E14 here leaves too many possibilities for later.]
