;W[qf]LB[qc:A][jd:C][ne:B]C["I didn't want to play in the san-san, because black could have made a big moyo on the right"

In that case to original approach was probably the wrong idea.  The pattern in the right occurs in pro games frequently and W almost always plays either A or B.  I do not recall ever having see this move in this situation. Perhaps W should have played C instead of playing an approach move.]

(;B[pf]LB[oc:A]C[This is an awful move. Apart from the fact that is it overconcentrated, an attachment is used in a defensive position.  B should be attacking.  See variation at 'A'.]

;W[re];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[nb]C[If B has played these first then he would have got to the hane on the second line first.]
;B[gc]LB[jp:A]C[Wrong direction completely. B is undercut at the top right and so has little prospect at the top. He should play 'A to increase the moyo and play a consistent strategy.  If he must play at the top left then an approach from the opposite side is required,]
;W[md]LB[pg:A]C["I wanted to cut : I thought it was important"

It is definitely an important point.  But I would hold of a little while and secure my own position first.  If B protects this point there is also the cut at 'A' to aim at.  As it stands W now has 3 isolated stones on the board and B has tremendous thickness so it is hard to imagine W being successful.  At the moment it is not appealing for B to take gote to protect the point to W can anticipate being able to play here later.]

;B[mf]C[Nice point.];W[kh];B[ne];W[le]C[This is not so big.  Only reason for W to conenct is if he expect to be able to attack one of the B groups which he keeps split.  This seems unlikely here so this is nothing more than a 5pt gote yose play.]
;B[nj];W[nq]LB[rg:B][jp:A]C["Don't play close to thickness"  - W already has two isolated stones on the board.  This creates a third one at a time when the group at the top is still not secure.  This is a recipe for defeat.  W should hold back to 'A' and try to threaten a moyo on the lower left quadrant.  As long at the 3-3 invasion and the move at 'B' are available to W then the B moyo on the right can be controlled.]

(;B[jq]C[The wide pincer anticipates a 3-3 invasion and a block on the side of the pincer.  This is not desirable for B in this position as he should be amain at territory on the right.  A one point pincer is better.  See the variation.]

;B[pm]C[Way too timid.]
(;W[cj]C[This is too lose.  Also, being low it is open to being capped, a move which will help B attack the group at the top.  W should be looking at the two B stones at the bottom.   Several alternative sequences have been show (without comments) for evaluation and consideration.]

;B[cl];W[do];B[ci];W[di]LB[dj:A]C[It is hard to see how B can respond to a move at 'A' instead of here.  That move would be a double threat against the single stone and the 3 stones below.]
