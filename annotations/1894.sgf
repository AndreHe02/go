C[In this game, it seems that white plays a better fuseki and quickly gains a strong position. I'd appreciate any advice on how I should have played quicker and more efficiently to develop my own position, and how I could have gone about reducing his position in the midgame.

- Hello, I'm Tom. I'll be reviewing for black.
- First, I agree that a stronger opening would have done much to help black's position in the game. So, it's good that you recognize this in your own play. I'll make specific comments as we go along.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[np]C[AcidCasual [23k?\]: I think it's gone
penguin [19k\]: k];W[pl];B[dp]C[Good! With influence in three corners, black has many options open to steer the opening in a profitable direction.]
;W[jd];B[jq];W[cj];B[cm]C[While this is not a bad move locally, I think it is not well balanced in regards to strategic development. I think the Q16 stone needs development before white attacks and forces a purely defensive position in this corner. Without a black presense in the upper part of the board, white stands to profit greatly in the middle game.]
;W[pf]C[White's attack begins. . . . I think this is the game. Your lack of serious influence at the top and right at this point will translate into white territory at the end. You lost by about 20 points. I think more black influence in this area earlier could have made the difference. Go to the end of the game now for a moment and see the end shape of territory. It is striking!]
;B[mc];W[re]C[Here white continues to threaten the corner while beginning to make territory on the right side.]
;B[rd];W[ne]C[he builds thickness here while I struggle not to get walled in]

(;B[md]SQ[me][le]C[You saw the threat of white sealing you into the corner. But trying to breakout with this move was too slow. White was able to seal off large portions of territory while black managed only to snake out a ways very profitable for white on the top and right.]
;W[me];B[le];W[lf];B[ke];W[nd];B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[kc]C[White L17 threatens to cut. This gives white an opportunity to both contain black on the outside and now start to build territory at the top.]
;B[ld];W[nn];B[kh]TR[hd][hc][fc]C[the next few moves make this seem like the wrong direction...should I have tried to move out towards top left, or left the situation as it was and played elsewhere?

The top is still invadable. Try practicing invasions in situations like this. You will succeed as often as you fail! In this case, I would look towards one of the marked points.

By invading you force white to a defensive stance. the white stones at k16 and L17 are weak. By getting influence here now, you will also gain a base to attack the upper left corner and eventually the upper left side.  Your move at L12 serves mostly to encourage white to defend what is becoming a huge piece of real estate on the right. Try not to induce moves that make your opponent stronger. Make your opponent send his initiative to gain that territory. He is only too happy to have you force big defensive moves.]
;W[mh];B[kf];W[if]C[Now invasion at the previously marked spots becomes more difficult, though it is not impossible.]
;B[dh]C[first attempt at reducing....

You say reducing. Yes, playing here on the fourth line leans more towards reduction than invasion. You should not be scared of going deeper here. The white stone at c10 can be effectively squeezed. And besides, you still have the option of invading the 3-3 point to counter nay attackes on your invading stone.]
;W[cf]C[Now you must play down to cut the c10 stone off. playing at c12 would have done this with one move. Your second move could have been a move toward the middle.]
;B[bh];W[ci]C[Whote peeps to build a base for an extension.   . .]
;B[ch];W[fj]
(;B[df]C[What about c15. Again going a little deeper would help your situation here. See variation.]

(;W[de];B[ef];W[gd];B[fh]C[At this point white has sealed off the top with g16. Invasion will be dificult now. Also black's shape is heavy. There is little eye shape. This black group is ripe for attack.]
;W[ei]C[This peep helps white left-side stones while doing nothing for black.]
;B[eh];W[hh];B[gi];W[em];B[ek]C[Good!];W[dl];B[ej]C[this move did me no favours...D9? C9? F9?]

;B[lo]C[maybe around J8 would have been better but W gets little in that area in the end

I think you are okay here. without this I think white could have invaded.]
;W[il];B[in]
(;W[hn]C[White should have prepared a cut by playing L6. h6 is too passive! See Variation.]
;B[im];W[hm];B[jl];W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[jm];W[mk];B[qi]C[I'm clearly behind at this point....seems like invasion is the only option]

[so]C[probably there are words to say about my endgame play also....

I wasn't too dissatisfied with the result but it's close enough that I feel that a couple of moves better chosen could have swung it my way. Hopefully you can give me some idea what they would have been. Thanks in advance for taking the time to look at this.

Hopefully, the comments have helped a bit. It's hard to play diferently when you cannot "see" different outcomes. I recommend using an editor like Cgoban or Many Faces of Go to review your games and try variations of your own at key points in the game! Try going deeper with your invasions. Try putting pressure on your opponent that you might not feel comfortbale risking in a game. Try to do this with as many games as you can. Also review games of stronger players, 10-15 stones stronger. Even pro games can help at your level. Just don't expect to understand it all at first. Do this will help you learn to see the board differently and strike at points that really pressure your opponent and deny him sente! 

Good luck to you. Please let me know if you have additional questions.

(;B[me]C[New variation];W[mf];B[le];W[lf];B[ke]C[I think this is better. White still gets some thickness but black is in a much better position. The main difference between this position and the game is the lack of the cutting point at m16. Without this white is staill able to contain black on teh outside but can't build territory at the top and right side. The white stone at k16 is now attackable.]
