C[Marc Hamelin : hello I'm reviewing your game
commentary are beginning by (MH)

(dada) I'M Arno from the GTL - I corrected some typos plus added my $0.02 on some places.


hello and thank you to the reviewer.

This is a game I think I should have won if it wasn't for two mindless and huge blunders. Nevertheless, even if I had won this would have happenned because of my opponent's mistakes and not because of my good moves :) I can't wait to play well enough to say: I won because I played better, and not because I played "not so bad" as the opponent. But I guess 90% of all the wins are based on the other's mistakes, which is a pity.

I would very much apreciate some ideas on how to deal with black's opening, as I got scared and treated it badly (even though I managed to nullify the thickness I gave him - but I guess it would be more apropriate to say the opponent did this to him/herself).

Anyway, this is the game. Thank you again for your time and effort.]
;B[pe]C[well, the question is: how should one deal with this kind of opening?
(MH) try the 4-4 point. When you understand all joseki on this point, try other points :-)]
;W[dp];B[op]C[again, the same?
(MH) if you want, but what is your plan ?
4-5 point are for an extension on the side plus center];W[dc]

(;B[jc]C[why this side ?

(MH) your move 1 is up and this one is low.]
(;W[pc]LB[jp:A]C[this looks bad now, as it is easy to be isolated in the corner

(MH) White fears a large Black corner. But it's not good now

(dada) 'A'(k4) instead is a good alternative];B[nd]C[(MH) ok, you turn off the corner and play for influence]
;W[od]C[I meant to cut the black stones in two. Not very wise, this wouldn't really put significant pressure on them. but if they were cut, their outside influence would suffer
(MH) White forces Black to make a wall - this is not a good move

(dada) the cut is not an option - black is stronger than you in this area]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[nc]LB[md:a]C[ok, 'a' is also good];W[qd]LB[qc:a]
C[guess it should have been A? this looks as bad shape, but I wanted to avoid empty triangles. Haven't thought of A at the time of playing. But I don't know if it would be any better.

(MH) 12 is ok. 'A' is less good because it's too small.];B[oc]
C[(MH) no, without interest];W[qe]C[very inconsistent of me; I get some territory in the corner but no cut.
(MH) ok, good, break the wall];B[pd];W[pb];B[pg];W[de]LB[ce:A]
[rg:B]C[I was "hurt badly" in the UR corner so I try to build something.

I think the only good thing about the UR corner is that black is a bit overcrowded there. is it so?

(MH) this move is not ok because Black has a stone on K16/17

(dada) B's K17 is indeed too close to B's thickness on the right
I would play your move low on c15 (A) - better for fighting, when B invades on the left
'B' (s13) is also worth considering];B[qf];W[pp]LB[jp:A]C[this is attempt to deal with the black opening; just as bad as the previous one; some territory but black gets a lot of outside influence/thickness

(dada) I would play at 'A' (k4)];B[po];W[qp];B[qo];W[oq];B[np]
;W[rp];B[ro]C[(MH) Black has a big moyo now];W[jj]LB[nq:A]C[this seems very necessary to prevent black from building a huge territory on the right

(MH) ok
(dada) I would argue that playing on o3 (A) is more urgent]
;B[nq]C[but I'm imprisoned in the corner.

(MH) create a weakness in the white structure is always interesting.]

(;W[or];B[nr]
(;W[qr]C[is this necessary? I guess I have to work a lot more on life and death problems. I just played it to be safe.

(MH) see variations]
(;B[iq]C[(dada) compare this outcome with the variation];W[dj]
LB[nj:a]C[(MH) no! limit the moyo ('a' for example)];B[pk]LB[nj:a]
C[(MH) too low, 'a' is better.];W[qi]C[I tried to use the fact I had nearby stones; but I was just trying.

(MH) no, you don't have the right to invode so deeply]
(;B[rf]C[(MH) not necessary];W[oi]C[I read on David Mechner's go web page that one should do what seems right, not what is comfortable. this move looks big (and even more, uncomfortable for my corner). but if the corner died, i don't know if it's bigger than the corner.

(MH) good move after a big mistake. Your corner is not dead

(dada) I think the corner can be killed (see variation later)]

(;B[sd]C[(MH) mistake];W[sb];B[qa];W[ra];B[ob];W[pa]LB[rd:a]
[rb:b]C[at this point I guess I managed to live in the corner. I don't think I would have lived if black A would have been at B]
;B[oa]C[sort of a "passive blunder": I didn't see the atari and I even thought to myself: what a wasted stone!]
;W[nj]C[(MH) oups ! and R18 ?];B[nl]C[(MH) too small now];W[hc]
C[This is an attempt to build a moyo while preventing black to do so. But it feels quite fragile. I wonder if it should feel differently; after all, it's just a moyo.

(MH) ok];B[fq];W[fo]LB[eo:A]C[the same

(dada) 'A' (e5) instead is worth a thought too];B[cq];W[cp]
;B[dq];W[io];B[im]C[(MH) too late]
(;W[ch]C[is this to defensive? probably so.

(MH) yes, see variation];B[gm]C[(MH) ok, timid stone];W[dm]
MA[cp][dp][dj]LB[em:a]C[is A better? this one looked more solid as it was aligned with the marked stones. does this alignment really provide more strength?

(MH) 64 is ok, but you loose contact with your central stone]
;B[hj]C[(MH) good attack];W[gh]C[I guess I'm still moyoing (building a moyo :) here; my stones on the right side start to look weak, but I think I can save them (am I overconfident?)

(MH) the danger is your central stones, not the left side];B[ii]
C[(MH) good move];W[li];B[jh];W[lg];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[qb]C[very painful because it was a complete and unpleasant surprise
anyway, I don't understand why black played this move at this moment

(MH) !!!!];W[fe]LB[ge:a]TR[nj][li][jj][lg][oi][qi]C[ok, so I'll try to secure some territory; is A better? it looks fragile

(MH) no, have a look at what is strong and what is weak.
So, help your weak group in the center (marked) or attack the opponent's weak group.
F15 is stupid because he win 3pts of territory, but black with the central moyo can win 50 pts.]
;B[gf];W[ff]LB[km:a][lm:b]C[(MH) same mistake. 'a' or 'b' are better.]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[hh];W[gi]LB[fj:a]C[is A better here?

(dada) I think so];B[hi];W[mf]C[time to try and live; maybe it's too late

(MH) too late];B[ng];W[mg]LB[ml:A]C[(dada) empyt triangle? (ouch)
If you are trying to live here, then expand your eyespace and force B jinto answering by attaching to his stones.
How about 'A'(n8)?];B[ic]LB[nh:a]C[seems wasted to me; A would be a lot of trouble for me.

(MH) ??];W[nh];B[og];W[ko];B[jq]C[(MH) no, close the center

(MH) ok, the game is going into the endgame
For me black has a little advantage. Fight and mistake are difficult for all players. but don't forget :
see the entire goban and find your weakness and those of the adversary.
Find your strong points and use them in fights.
For example a wall does not make territory directly, but it can make a pressure on an unfavourable group.
Connect your groups and cut unfavourable.

C[... and I saved the stone I was worried about :))]
(;B[kl]LB[kk:a]C[black doesn't see A which is the new vital point (is it?) for the center group. The problem is that I don't see it, too.

(dada) yes 'A' kills W's center group - see variation];W[ik]
;B[hk];W[no];B[oo];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[ei];W[eh];B[kk]C[i'm killed in the center but I still try to do something in the next few moves...

Anyway, sorry for asking for comments on a game with so many mistakes, but I'm really interested in how to deal efficiently with black's opening. And another question: how black could have used better the influence it had on the right side? It seems weird to me that if it wasn't for my 2 stupid (great) mistakes (I made a lot of smaller mistakes, of course :), black wouldn't have had any territory on the side of the board he seemed to possess.

(dada) well, B made many small moves throughout the fight, which gave you enough time to patch your weaknesses.
If B would have attacked without remorse I don't think you would've come away with your deep invation.]
