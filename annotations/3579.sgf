Enjoy the review.  Word of caution I'm rather blunt.  I will discuss moves for both sides so that you can get all the information possible from this review.  I always compare openings to professional play because I feel professionals have the basics down far better than we do and it's a means to really understand good play.]

LB[nd:B][qj:A]C[These two points are also possible.]
(;B[qj]LB[pj:A]C[In professional play this stone is at A.  The reason is...]

(;W[jp]LB[nq:A]C[This move is usually at A.]
(;B[jc]LB[fc:B][jd:A]TR[qj]C[A is the point for the same reasons stated before.  I really like B better although now the two marked stones make a double wing formation.  You're a bit too territorial in your approach.]
;W[nq];B[pn]
(;W[cq]C[This is slow for white and simply a grab for territory.]
;B[fc]C[Good point.  Do you see how if k 16 were higher you'd have a great mix of high and low stones?  You always want an even mix of high and low stones.  You're top moyo is too flat.]

(;W[cg]C[Weak.  The corner is still open.]
(;B[db]LB[ic:A]TR[jc]C[I hesitated here to play directly the center K10 which seems big to me. Then I thought that D18 was big if not replied but I guess that I was wrong.


Don't be enamored with the center stone so much.  This is not the best response because you are simply saying "okay White, let's just split up the corner nicely" instead of just taking it.  Besides K 17 is too far, J 17 is the distance this stone should be.]
;W[cc]
(;B[jj]TR[hc]C[I have the feeling that the fuseki is good for me. Is it correct ?
The tengen isn't as big as you think.]
(;W[pg]LB[rd:B][oe:A][nf:C]C[This is a bad point, normally when W wants to come into b's strong moyo, he might play at A or B.  A is called the ear of the shimari, and B is a special sabaki move.  C is an extremely special case move that I wont go into.  Sabaki (in Go) means to try and gain a strong position in your opponents realm of control by making use of any little weakness or opening.  Do not expect to overpower your opponent because it is his area of control, all your expectations are to be is that you develop part of it for yourself.]
;B[oi]C[nice.];W[ng];B[mi];W[lg]
(;B[ki]C[Now I thnk that I am over concentrated with this move. Maybe I should have play P15 instead  to build a larger territory on the top edge?

It's not a matter of overconcentration, this move is weak.]

(;W[me]
(;B[mc]C[I am happy to make territory by chasing his group. But maybe is is too small ?

This is fine for you, if W is going to make weak moves just for the sake of living profit from it.]
;W[ke]LB[lq:A]C[Let White live in gote, jhe's not making many points and you've used the attack (albeit not to its full efficiency) to make points.  Now we need to turn towards whites moyo and see what gains we can make there.]

(;B[qf]C[My idea here is to build territory on the right edge and take away his life base there. Is this correct or is there anything better?

This is still pretty small.  Again, invasion is very big especially since you have the N11 wall to back it up.]
;W[qg];B[ri];W[pf];B[qe];W[oe]
(;B[ie]C[I keep chasing but J15 has maybe not such a big interest. Maybe 05 would had been better?

First off you are not chasing anything, the W group is alive and has two eyes.  05 is not a good point, here is why:]
;W[jf]C[Move onto the bigger points, this is slow.];B[if];W[ld]
;B[lc];W[ig];B[pq]C[Solid.];W[no]C[But now W defends.]
(;B[nm];W[go]C[Again you're letting W complete his moyo and turn it into territory.]

(;B[lp]C[This is too deep.]
(;W[lq]C[This is far too nice.];B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[kp]C[W is being very kind.]
;B[ln];W[kn]
(;B[hg]C[Can you see the N15 W group is perfectly alive and that this point does little in the way of increasing your territory?]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[kl];B[il];W[dm];B[io]C[I guess that my move is bad here since it indces White to build esaily big territory

Again, too deep.  You need to keep mental track of what types of connections your stones have.]

(;W[ip];B[ho];W[hp];B[ch]C[I wanted here to invade his territory butr I had no idea how to do it. Is there a better way?  

You waited too late to invade and instead let W consolidate his power.  Your chance to invade was a lot earlier.  Playing here and trying to make sabaki will be difficult.]

[po][qo][so][qp][rp]C[Yose is not my forte, sorry ;)  So i could only comment on the beginning moves and middle game.  It was a good game all in all and I hope you learn something from the review.

How to get better:

You absolutely must get better acquainted with living/dead shapes.  If a group you are chasing is totally alive, you are no longer chasing it ;)  You wasted many moves trying to attack a living group in the center.  Also keep in mind high/low mix of stones in the opening.  Lots of Tsumego will clear all these problems up.]

I think you're worried about W taking root in the top somewhere (I always fear this as well) however this is almost impossile when W is sealed in around strong positions.

Now after you read the rest of the review I want you to come back here so I can make a very important point.  By atttacking and sealing in this W group you develop power in the face of W's moyo.  By attacking to gain power, you can now make invasions and reduce W's moyo with impunity while holding onto the territory you've solidly made.]
