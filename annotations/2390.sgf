;B[qd];W[dp];B[ee]C[L: this looks like a strange combination: 5-5 goes straight for influence, while komuku is a more steady, slower move.]

;W[fe]LB[ff:a][ef:b]C[cyrsolix: I did not know how to treat this situation. How should I reason?

L: white plays a contact move on top of your stone so it is a good idea to react. Your options ara 'a' or 'b'.

You played 'a' but left the possibility for white to cut you at 'b'.
Maybe 'b' was better because this leaves no defect and gives you the possibility to cut white in the future.]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[fq]LB[cn:a][nq:b]C[this is the wrong direction. A normal white response 'a' would reduce your influence on the left side. If you want to stabilize this stone Bb is better i think.

Also the upper right corner is now a hotspot.];W[gf];B[fg]LB[nd:a]

;W[fl];B[il];W[im]C[cyrsolix: A running battle. Who is before? Which are the strategies?

L: If possible enclose white, second keep the white groop separated from allies. Third: while trying this try to make influence or profit.

In this concrete situation you can check the variation and see that white can live. This means it is the most important  to stabilize your center group.
 
Who is better is difficult to say, this is determined by the running battle and who is first in playing in the upper right.]

;W[pl];B[nm]TR[hn][lm]C[In this running battle it is remarkable how many forcing moves you have played. Some where good for making your opponent heavy but some like this and the triangled where only to make white stronger.
Sometimes by leaving the situation, later in the game you get the opportunity to make a cut, it is important to keep future options open.]

=================
Dear reviewer,
thank you in advance for your thoughts and teachings.

Please make this a review for a wider audience than me. I do not know which pat of my play, I need to develop the most so I choose not influence your review with my thoughts of the game.

The only thing I know for sure is that white owned me completely in the endgame.

Best regards,

Cyrsolix.

It is difficult to say which part of the game you should develop. Maybe your sense of good direction (playing from the side of the weak group) Also not playing tenuki at move 122 costed you a lot.]
