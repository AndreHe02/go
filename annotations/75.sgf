C[Review by Dan Schmidt, NNGS 6k*, AGA 5k.];B[dd];W[pp];B[dp]
;W[pc];B[dj]
(;W[pi]LB[fq:A]C[It's a little slow for White to play all his moves on one side without approaching, as Black will get the last good point.  Playing at A would be more usual; see the variation.]
;B[jp];W[jd];B[gc];W[lq]LB[fq:A][cn:B]C[If White keeps pushing gently on Black's moyo like this, it will get more and more solid, and harder to invade.  Already playing at A or B is harder than an approach at A back at move 6 would have been, but you're going to have to do it at some point.]
;B[jr];W[lo]C[Black is getting more out of this exchange than White.]
;B[jn];W[he]LB[dq:A][dn:B]C[Slow -- this isn't making territory for you, or taking much away from Black.  Playing at a 6-3 or 3-3 point is called for.  If black gets to play A or B, almost that whole quarter of the board will be his.]
;B[df];W[jj];B[lm]C[This is a weird game to comment because both players are playing so tentatively.  They're making little feints in the center while there is still a lot of te rritory to be scooped out on the sides.  K10 and M7 are both reasonable moves as far as the balance of power goes, but there' s more important places to play.]
;W[pn];B[nn];W[ol];B[np];W[nq]C[Black has only made it harder for himself to invade the corner.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[mq];W[nr];B[mp];W[mr];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp];W[cn]
C[Finally!  But now it will be tougher than it would have been a lot earlier.]

(;B[cl]LB[co:A]C[A is usual here; see variation.]
(;W[en]C[I would just dive into the corner and live; see variation.  Now W is going to be under attack for a while, while B takes a big corner.]
;B[fp];W[gm];B[il];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[cp];B[cr];W[bm]
;B[bl];W[do];B[ep];W[pe];B[qg]LB[qi:A]C[B also has waited too long.  R13 is unreasonable.  Attaching immediately at R11 has a better chance of living.]

(;W[rh]LB[qi:A]C[Making an iron pillar at A would be very strong.  B would have nowhere to go.  By playing contact moves you strengthen B.]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[re]LB[qd:A]C[B will not live taking baby steps like this.  R16 looks most promising.]

(;W[rc]LB[qd:A]C[This leaves a weak point at A.  I would just play at A in the first place; see variation.]
;B[og];W[pg];B[pf];W[ph];B[oe]LB[of:A][qf:B]C[This is weird.  A would protect against the cut at B.]

(;W[sg]C[The worst move W has made so far.  See variation.]
;B[pd];W[od];B[qe]LB[qc:A]C[Now B is almost totally safe and W's stones in the corner are weak.  Wedging in at A could be nasty at some point.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[ng]C[Nice shape-spoiling move.];B[mg]
;W[nh];B[nf];W[le];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd]C[Now Black has one eye for sure, and another eye in gote at S14 when he wants it.]
;W[ob];B[sf];W[kg];B[lh]C[There are much more interesting things to do than this.]
;W[lj]LB[dc:A][di:B][dh:C]C[This is practically playing on a dame point.  Any of the marked invasions are much bigger.]
;B[dh]C[Now things are harder.];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[bd]
;B[be];W[eb];B[fb]C[I believe this is unreasonable.  There are too many cutting points.]

;W[ef];B[ed];W[eh];B[ff];W[di]TR[ef]C[Good; the marked stone is not that important, and you may end up capturing the three black stones on the left.]
;B[ch];W[eg];B[ci]
(;W[ei]TR[di]LB[gg:A][ge:B]C[D11 is also not worth saving.  I'd move out quickly instead of making yourself heavy.  See variation.  On the other hand, you are probably already pretty assured of connecting to something.]
;B[ge];W[ba]C[Save it for a ko threat.];B[cb];W[ej];B[cj]LB[dk:A]
C[This could be at A.];W[hb]C[Too close. You're certainly not going to kill Black, and he's a lot stronger here than you are.  J18 would be fine.]
;B[hd];W[ie];B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[ia];W[gg];B[fg];W[fh]
;B[gh];W[gf]LB[hg:A]C[In retrospect this should be at A.  You're filling up your liberties too much.]
;B[fe]

(;B[dl]LB[fk:A]C[Black must play A instead and start the ko.  White has much more to lose in the ko than Black.]
;W[fk];B[fn]LB[dn:A][co:B]C[I'd play A first, which is sente and makes B a false eye.]
;W[fm];B[gn]LB[fo:A]C[This move and A are miai; no rush to play either one of them.]
;W[hm];B[im];W[fo];B[in];W[eo];B[dn];W[gp];B[gq]C[Unreasonable.]

C[Now that's a ko threat. Too bad there isn't a ko any more :)]
;B[ad];W[da]C[-1 points in gote.];B[mn];W[oo];B[rl]C[I doubt this is necessary.]
;W[sl];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[I guess the main points that come to mind from doing this review are:

 - Don't wait too long to approach your opponent's territory, especially as White.
 - Contact moves are generally for defending.  Be careful using them when attacking, as they strengthen the opponent and reduce your liberties.
 - Always look for opportunities to make better shape.
 - Don't forget about your groups and let them be killed.  The group on the left would have died if Black played accurately.  The group in the middle did die.  Black had the same thing happen to him in the lower left, so it evens out. :)]
