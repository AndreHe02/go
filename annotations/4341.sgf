[jc:O]C[(Rev): this move(black 5), isnt a bad one, but since you are still learning i suggest you, that you try more conventional moves for the fuseki(opening), when you understand the reason behind those move you can move to more complicated ones. The letters A to O are some posibilities on the opening.]
;W[jp];B[jf]LB[dj:A][jc:B]TR[cf][fc][cj][ci][cc][jd][ej][lc]
C[(Rev) this move (7), its not the best on this scenario,  you are not protecting territory cuz you still have holes on yours positions.
The triangles show you the holes on the position.
while the letters show some others posibilties that you should try insted of 7(try it yourself, you will see the difference)]
;W[dj];B[pj];W[jd];B[ie];W[je]C[(Rev) : the next move its too risky, black can be cut anytime and can be seriouly attack. I suggest more moves like the options i give.]

(;B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[ld];B[kf]C[(Rev) :  good move for black, you protect the cutting point on the shape.]
;W[me]C[(Rev) :  a very good move for white, the hane on this group gives more advantage on the framework of the territory.]
;B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[of]C[(Rev): the move that black do, on N13 form the shape known as the empty triangle, i suggest that you should try avoid doing this kind of shape.]
;B[mg]C[(Rev): empty triangle, cuz  there its no stone on O13. White gain a lot of territory with the forcing move of P13.]
;W[og];B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[qj]C[(Rev) : This isnt a real threat black doesnt need to protect the cutting point now.]

(;B[ni];W[qh]C[(Rev) : White protect the cutting point, its a good move in the board, but dont forget that ther its still a lot of territory and black doesnt have much, so he is still behind, the lack of territory its not compensated with the outside influence in this game.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[rl]C[(Rev) : its better to connect S10]
(;W[ri];B[sk];W[rj];B[sl]C[(Rev) : This move its too small maybe the variation will be better.]

(;W[sj];B[ql];W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[gc]C[(Rev) : Here the double atari at H14 will be a better move for white and for black the G15 will be better.]

(;W[hb];B[gb];W[he];B[gd];W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[ge];W[gf];B[ff]
;W[fg]C[(Rev) : Good moves for white, the ponnuki left by the capture of the J15 stone its very powerful.]
;B[gh]C[(Rev) : I suggest to both that you dont need to do this forcing move, because you only keep the sente(initiative) but after you only left a weak stone.]
;W[gg];B[ga];W[ha];B[fe];W[eh];B[ef];W[di];B[eg];W[fh];B[dg]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh]C[(Rev) : This its better, the hai at the end of the groups.]

(;B[ag];W[ah];B[hh];W[gi];B[ih];W[hi]C[(Rev) : This is not a cutting point, black shoul answer at J11(see variation)]

(;B[jg];W[ij];B[jk];W[ik];B[ii];W[jl]C[(Rev) : Good move for white, the hane at the two stone gives a lot of influence on this game. Black need to answer at L8(see variation) because as i said early there is no danger of cut.]

(;B[ji];W[kl];B[lm]C[(Rev) : Another empty triangle, this its not the best move for white.(see variation)]

(;W[km];B[ll];W[kk];B[kj];W[ln];B[lk];W[mn]TR[kn][il]C[(Rev) : As you can see, white its destroying the black territory but it has a lot of cutting points like the triangles, so he has to protect some of thems.]
;B[nm];W[cq]C[(Rev) : Good move.];B[no];W[mo]TR[mp][lp]C[(Rev) : As i say, in this game i see a lot of empty triangles, this make your territory too unstable. The triangles are better moves.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[mm];W[np];B[op];W[mp];B[mr];W[lr];B[ls]C[(Rev) : Punishing black for being greedy its a must here. (see variation)]

(;W[ks];B[ms];W[nr];B[lq];W[ns]C[(Rev) : Big mistakes of Black.]
;B[kr];W[kq];B[oq];W[gq];B[nn];W[cm];B[jr];W[ir];B[js];W[lp]
;B[ls]C[(Rev) : White doesnt know how to manage this stones, even if they doesnt have eyes, the solution its simple, just take the space to make eyes (see variation)]

;W[dn];B[ho];W[gm];B[fm];W[en];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl]C[(Rev) : The next move its not a threat.]

(;W[in];B[gk];W[hn];B[fl];W[cc]C[(Rev) : Remember that a player can always invade, the matter its that is a mistake or not.]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[hk];W[il]C[(Rev) : The next black moves, only give white more stones to capture.
I suggest the next moves.]

;B[io];W[jo];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[bc];B[ae]C[(Rev) : Interesting moves for black, but doesnt kill the group yet.]
;W[ad];B[bf];W[af];B[cb];W[bb];B[ae];W[db];B[bd];W[ca];B[eb]
C[(Rev) : White is alive but he can see it. The solution its simple.]

(;W[cb];B[ba];W[be];B[cf];W[ks];B[bd];W[ls]C[(Rev) : Black doesnt need to take the stones they are already dead.]
;B[aa];W[jq];B[tt];W[im];B[dr];W[dq]C[(Rev) : The next move diminish black territory, remember that in japanese rules the territory to count its the sorrounded one.]
;B[gs];W[gm]C[(Rev) : good move for white.];B[go];W[gl];B[or]
;W[cs];B[os];W[gq]C[(Rev) : This move doesnt make damage to black, i guess that a invasion could be better.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[jc]C[(Rev) : White only needs to continue.(see variation)]

(;W[kc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ia];W[ka];B[tt];W[ja]C[(Rev) : Again, black doesnt need to cover, there its no weakness(see variation)]

(;B[ib];W[qp]C[(Rev) : The cutting point in P5 its not endangered so you need to diminish the posibilities of white live.(see variation)]

(;B[oo];W[qq];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp]C[(Rev) : This crosscut its a good idea, but i recomend that you do it only when the corner its not cover like this one, more on the beggining, try to look the josekis(corner paterns) that use this moves.]
;W[rq];B[rn];W[sp];B[sn];W[so];B[pq];W[qr];B[qs];W[rs];B[ps]
;W[sr]C[(Rev) : black its ok here, cause doesnt need to protect the cut its not too good.
instead it can try an invasion at R17.]

[br][mr][rr][as][bs][ss]C[I guess thats all.
As i was requested, i can give you some advice on the fuseki. i suggest that you try to build more, playing on the corner a few moves and on the side, so you can ensure you a better framework.
On the middle game you need to polish some of your skills with the fight, i suggest you that you review some pro games like the ones of Otake Hideo(they are very difficult to fully understand but seeing them will help you to improve). On the Yose (ending of the game),i guess that making some Tsume go of life and death can help to understand when a invasion will be succesfull or not.

I hope that this review will be of any use to you.
