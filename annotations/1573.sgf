C[my main question is what dan level play this is for Dummy(b)


QianJiang 4d, 200304:
Hello,
I'll try but It's hard to determine the level by one game. And you may get different local ranks in different places.
English is not my first language, so sorry if there is some spell / grammer mistakes.]

;B[cr];W[br];B[cs]C[Black should have been more aggressive in the upper right corner? Black believes he couldn't have surpassed the komi. Please try to give a good guess at the dan level black is playing.


QianJiang 4d, 200304:
To me I cannot find strong moves for black there.
I think w is much stronger than b. See maybe he can handicap you 3 or more.
B can be ameteur dans. I do not think 1d* is too much underrated. But it's hard to say these by only one game. I think internet is a good place to know your rank, IGS or other servers are good. Play 20 games on IGS then you will know your rank, which maybe more accurate than your local rank.
