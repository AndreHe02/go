;B[pd]C[Hi, I'm mostly interested in learning fuseki. Thanks for your work.

 gbohus 15k*: hi

<tomjk> Hi, I hope my comments will be useful. My comments will be preceeded by <tomjk> (which is my name on KGS)

<tomjk> Summary:
White played too many stones on the left side and Black got the lead by taking the important points on the other three sides.

White then invaded to early in the lower right corner giving Black a tremendous outside strength.

White had then to invade into strong Black spheres of influence and a small misstep decided the faith of a big group and the game.

Hint:
Try to balance better your presence on the board in the first 10-15 moves, then you should not need to invade into strong enemy territory and struggle uphill to get your groups out of trouble.]

(;W[df]LB[hc:A][ic:B][jc:C]C[<tomjk> White should consider playing a "pincer attack somewhere at A, B or C. See variation.
With a move like the actual one, it seems that White is playing too many stones on one side of the board. In the fuseki it is important to try to use your stone most efficiently.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[jd]LB[hc:B][ic:A]C[<tomjk> normally played at A. This move leaves a weak point at B.]
;W[dm]LB[bj:C][jq:A][nq:B]C[<tomjk< this should be at A or B now. With the actual move White has played all stones on one side.
Black instead has covered two sides of the board. Black has played more efficiently!
Also White has all of his stones except  one played on the fourth line. Beware, Black can play later underneath at C (see variation) and create trouble.
D10 would be better at C10 here to balance the position on the left side.]

(;B[fq];W[hq]C[<tomjk> good!];B[cq];W[cp]C[<tomjk> this seems to be the right side to block (I think), but with D7 in place, White is overconcentrated on the left side (i.e. has played too many stones there at this stage of the game.]
;B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[eq]LB[fr:A]C[gbohus: I know very little joseki, but of what I know B diverged from the standards which should be good for W. I kept going to close B in. Did this make sense?

<tomjk> Yes, good thinking. Normal play by Black would be not at "A".

See also variation for standard joseki.];W[fp]C[<tomjk> very good!]
;B[jq];W[gq]C[<tomjk> very good!. That is where Black should have played instead of K3.]
;B[mq]C[<tomjk> Black should not give up his four stones. Must play at B4.]

(;W[bq]C[<tomjk> good!];B[br]
(;W[bp];B[ar];W[qq]C[<tomjk> this is little bit early.  Now Black gets a lot of outside influence and you have no stones on the outside to counter this.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rr];B[pr];W[qr];B[or];W[sq]
C[gbohus: W is alive but it feels terribly small compared to the B's outward influence. Is this true? Should W have left this corner alone completely? At least W has sente.

<tomjk> this invasion is a little bit too early at this stage of the game.
A probing move at S4 or R4 would have been maybe better Also simply Q7 would be ok I think.
We see now that White has trouble since he has played all of is beginning stone on the left side. It is an uphill struggle.]
;B[oo];W[qg]C[<tomjk> good. This move on the other side would have been better than the plain 3-3 invasion you played.]
;B[qf]
(;W[rg]LB[og:A]C[<tomjk> not good. This creates a heavy group. Black has easy time to attack.
White should immediately jump out to A. See variation.];B[rf]

;W[lj];B[ki];W[kj]C[gbohus: W is probably going to live but B built some pretty strong stuff in the meantime. Where should W have abandon this group?

<tomjk> White can not abandon this group. White played too slow in the beginning, creating a heavy group here.
When invading a strong enemy position you must play "sabaki", i.e. light and flexible structures.
The result here favours heavily Black. It is hard to see how White can win this game.]

 gbohus 15k*: this is silly. even without this you win by far.
 gbohus 15k*: thanks for the game.

gbohus: And so W resigns.

<tomjk> in this kind of games you should resign earlier (I konw it is not easy). This way you can play another game and get more from it than to hope on some error to come back in the game.]
