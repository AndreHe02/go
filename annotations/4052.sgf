C[dksk: hello dear reviewer. i am black... i have some questions at some moves. i would be glad if you can give me the main reason why i am not a 1d but a 5k. thanks :)

prana: You have good fighting skills, and you showed good positional overview.
But, in this game white clearly dominated the game with an impressive style. 
(Chapeau, he is probably much stronger than me, the reviewer)

However, if I may give you an advice how to improve your Go technique:
- Try to avoid bad shape
- keep in mind the direction of play
- don't invade too early

(;B[gd]LB[cc:D][ec:B][fd:C][pj:A]TR[di]C[prana: the w pincer is wide, so you have plenty of choice to play.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[ec]
(;B[ff]TR[di]C[prana: this  exchange is a little questionable, since the w marked stone is in good distance to your wall.]
;W[ge];B[cc];W[fc]C[prana: w plays very solid.]
(;B[bd];W[nc]LB[kc:A][lc:C][id:E][jd:B][kd:D]TR[ge]C[prana: since the distance between the white stones is huge, you easily can separate them, if you don't want white to have a big territory here.]

(;B[qf];W[kd]C[dksk: after this move should i worry about white territory on the top? try to invade or make some forcing moves? or was R14 already wrong? i just didnt like the strong white territory...
prana: Do not invade too early, there are a lot of other big moves to play first.
I agree, the white stones fit together well. R14 is slow.];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[fo]LB[cn:A][cq:B]C[prana: I would have prefered b A or B.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[hp]C[prana: bad shape, wrong direction. Don't push from behind...]
;W[ip];B[ho]C[dksk: when i got that H3 pincer i always become so small between white stones. is it a good way of playing D6 or C6 after white H2?
prana: yes. Or c3 see variations.
b is overconcentrated, and white is establishing a group on the buttom.]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[fr];B[io]C[prana: expensive. w is making territory on 4th line.]
;W[jp]TR[io]C[prana: exchange is good for w.];B[er];W[gr];B[dq]
C[prana: The b group still has no secure base.];W[nq]C[dksk: thought that white had too many territory. tried to break one...
prana: I would answer on Q6. 
The bottom territory is not that big. Furthermore, the K4 group is not weak, so there is nothing to attack.]

;W[jn];B[km];W[jm];B[lm];W[qp];B[qo];W[rq]C[prana: you succeeded in invading the small bottom territory, but you lost territory in the corner and on the right side. That is why I think, it would have been better to defend on the side first.]

(;B[pj]C[dksk: before this R5??
prana: S5 is certainly big.
But the b mojo is hollow, w can reduce it easily.];W[ro];B[qn]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[pg]TR[oe][of][ng][mh][mi]C[dksk: could not find a good answer at all
prana: b is very thick in this area. Try to attck the w stone.
In my opinion, the w move is played a little too deep.
Normally, w reduces near the border line of the mojo]
(;B[qg];W[pi];B[qi];W[oj];B[ph]C[prana: you are strengthening w. (pushing from behind)]

(;B[nj];W[og];B[qh];W[ni];B[ok];W[li]C[dksk: at this point white is ahead. right? i just dont understand why am i too behind... was i too slow? even my territory is less than white's i dont have more power too. what is the point? i hope you have given some examples from preview moves.
prana: yes, w has a safe lead.]
(;B[ki]C[dksk: seems like this is too agressive. what can be the alternative?

(;B[id]C[dksk: thought i could live in it with some forcing moves
