;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[qd];B[oc];W[pf];B[ld];W[de];B[dg]C[E15 is also OK, perhaps? This joseki try to take advantage of B's M16 - ie, if B played L16, E15 joseki is not so good because N17 is a weak spot.]
;W[ec]C[Simply F15 is sufficient. W worrys about W F15, B F17 that gives B too many territories at upper side? The W should choose C17 to live D15 stone ASAP then try to reduce the upper side.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[ce];W[cd]C[Huh? W has less stones (therefore, strength) is this area - clearly an overplay. E15 then K16/K17 is better. If desires corner, ought C14 then make the cut.]
;B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[hd]C[W become stronger, should expand forward to K line - say K17. If B L17 W K16 - perfect for W and too narrow for B.]
;B[ic];W[id];B[jc]C[Now B is solid on the upperside - which defeat the purpose of playing E17 at the beginning. W gains too little after these sequences.]
;W[hc];B[fb];W[gb];B[ck]C[Wrong direction - O3 is the move. B has strong background (C15 group) should let W invade left and attack it.]
;W[fq];B[iq]C[Good idea to pinch, but should go for H3 (W C3 B C4 then take O3 or E9) or K3 (W C3 B D3 then take O3 - if W choose to fight, say C6; use F4 and B has the upper hand).]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[fo]C[H3 to live might be better. Because W could still invave at C7/C13 at left side (settle each gropp before invade; otherwise, very high chance been double-played. F5 helps B D6 thus helping B gain territory at right - not a good idea while invading points are still available.]
;B[cn]C[What's wrong with D6?];W[ip];B[nq]C[H3 then G3 - B is in position of attacking, shouldn't let W K3 settle so easily.]
;W[oq]C[K3 might be better - secure F3 and put presure on O3; also, it make F5 at a much better position.]
;B[jq];W[jp]C[H3...];B[hp];W[ho];B[kp]C[G4 - no matter what would happen. B was attackint using H3, yet try to live using L4? Since B didn't O4, O3 stone is 'light' - disposable.]
;W[gp]C[It's hard to attack W now. O2/N3 would be excellent next move.]
;B[hq];W[ko]C[N3, threat the root of K3 group. Because of J5, L5 is not a strong move at all.]

C[Do W really need H2? If B H2, W G2 - W is alyays one liberty ahead.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qn];W[qp];B[qh];W[pc];B[pj]C[Q6 right away. Q6 threat corner and B P12 next. If W invade at R10, B P12 - as W try to live at right, lower-right corner become more danger and B's upper side is OK as well (B has the sente for P16).]
;W[nc]C[Q6. Judging by R12-Q10, B value the moyo at right more; so W should prevent it from happening.]
;B[mc];W[nb]C[O16. B is forming a moyo. Besides, P17 is dead (if B O18, W has P18, right?).]
;B[nd];W[od];B[mb]C[Should have P15 then P13 - W is sealed at the right.]
