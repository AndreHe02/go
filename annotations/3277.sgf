C[Hello,

In this game I think I had a huge advantage at the beginning, but I bungled it in the midgame.  My advantage was slowly cut away until the end where I barely won.

Thank you for reviewing my game,

thecloudz


Hi, all my comment will be preceded with double hash (##)

## this joseki is not good, as white will build wall, facing your shimari, and devalue it. C15 (triangle) is usually not good as it leaves cutting point for white, which can be exploited later (as it is too closed to 'A']

(;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[de]C[<thecloudz> I think white makes a couple of mistakes in response to this cut, but is this the right move?

and was this an okay choice of joseki, given my top right position?

## as I said, this joseki will lead to a wall by white, which devalues your shimari on the right.]

## There was not much to say about your game. It entered endgame quickly. You have to watch for attacking moves in the opening. If your weak group has some options, don't worry too much about it. that's all.....
