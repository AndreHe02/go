;B[kj];W[dd];B[jc];W[dk];B[ci];W[cj]C[for white - you could have  pincered at c8, and if black at b3 then white at g3]
;B[cf]C[on a 19x19 7 would be at d5, here you need to think about eye space at B10 or running out to connect at centre]
;W[bd];B[di];W[hk];B[fk];W[gc]C[now white has a strong group - lots of space for eyes - at top of board, white's stones d3 and c4 are able to create a living shape; black has no stabilised group yet, though k11, l4 are OK, B has two weak groups - should ring warning bell - white has only 1 weak group at h3]
;B[fc]C[here Black might have played e4 to stabilise his group on L or f10 to get response w at f11 and black then plays e9]
;W[fd]C[Is F12 better? I would say no, but beware of cross cut at g10, if he doers this then black builds a powerful moyo on right]
;B[ec]C[white to play c12 to get eyes?];W[dc];B[gb];W[fb]C[A blatant mistake. G10 instead? definitely, or the double hane at h12?]
;B[eb];W[db];B[gd];W[ed];B[hc]C[attack from your weak side (stone h3) by playing g2 or play e4]
;W[jk]C[why not attach B weak stone at f3 by playing e4 - even though the shape is considered by professionals to be vulgar? stones h3 and k3 don't have much eye space. L3 not k3!]
;B[kk];W[kl]C[still play e4];B[ll];W[jl];B[ek]C[white to play e2 to make corner group  live,]
;W[dl]C[white now has two weak groups and black none.];B[dj]
;W[ck];B[gl]C[f5 would attack black - threatens to cut at e4; k7 would be useful. if black plays l9 or l6 he's practically won.]
;W[gk]C[is g3 making eye shape / space? NO, h5?, trying to link to group at top lh corner.]
;B[hl];W[il];B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[hi]C[white is building black's strength - can you feel the strength of black's wall c5 through to g5?]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[ig];W[hg]C[no - k6 to get eyes];B[gh]C[now k7 is white's next move]
;W[if]C[whoops, white now in danger.];B[jg];W[jh];B[jf];W[ge]
C[NO ! need to get rh sude group alive - l6 .];B[kh];W[ji]C[doomed- dead three shape.]
;B[jj];W[ki]C[are you counting your liberties?];B[li]C[one eye - J5 only move]
;W[kg]C[liberties, liberties - one must be able to count liberties.]
;B[ii]C[very dead white group, white resign?];W[hd];B[gc];W[ij]
C[self atari - count liberties. PLEASE];B[he];W[id];B[gf];W[fe]
;B[ie];W[ic];B[ib];W[jd]C[more dead stones (moves 58, 62, 66, 68)]
