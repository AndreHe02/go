C[I am a new player. And, I believe my opponent was a beginner as well.

I am looking to understand from your review the most basic errors in a beginner game. What can I do most differently to raise my ability in Go?

As this is my first ever review I ran this past a friend of mine (1Kyu)  to ensure I was not giving bad advice.  His comments are marked as TJ]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp]C[fairly standard opening, it is well worth learning joseki for the 4-4 point as a lot of games use this point (not to mention handicap games) be sure to learn how to take advantage when the joseki move is not played though - don't just learn the moves, learn the reasons behind them.

TJ: Excellent advice];B[fq];W[eq]C[TJ: This move works better when White has a stone at K4 or J4 (or thereabouts). Why? Because after Black adds a stone with F4, White can play D6 taking potential territory while attacking Black's group.

The real purpose of E3 is _not_ to take corner territory, but to force Black to play F4, creating a "heavy" group, i.e., a group which cannot easily be sacrificed.]

(;B[ep]C[this is a fairly weak move, which white does take advantage of.

TJ: Yes, this is a mistake. Correct is F4. Black should not ignore E3 under normal circumstances, as a White play on F4 would be very big.]
;W[fp]C[This completely destroys any shape you had, very bad news.]
;B[gp];W[eo];B[go];W[gq];B[fr];W[gr]C[TJ: Black should now play elsewhere and save E2 for use later on. This is a tremendously important concept: an idea which does not yet work, but may be useful later is called "aji" -- potential. You should try to hold on to your own aji and to reduce the opponent's; don't use up aji until you can get some real gain from it. In this case, E2 does not rescue the stones, and instead uses up a play that could have been used to affect later fighting, for instance as a ko threat. Therefore, the move E2 is a loss.]
;B[er];W[dr]
(;B[lo]C[This is the right idea, however you dont have the strength on the G / H line to do this.

TJ: The thinking behind this move is pretty good, as Al says. By playing M5 you are lending the G4/5 group a hand, but from a distance. This means that if White wants to capture the G4/5 group, she will have to take it "on a small scale", since it would be very difficult to come up with an attack on M4 as well, since it is so distant.

Nevertheless, there are better moves. It's still the opening, so there are plenty of bigger plays than either defending or protecting the G4/5 group. For example, an enclosure at C13 or C14 would develop your star point while blunting the effect of White's "thickness" (strong group) in the lower left. Again, an approach at R6 would also be good.   If you want to get strong in the opening and fast, then prioritise like this:   CORNERS FIRST,  ENCLOSURES and APPROACHES (equal in value) NEXT, EXTEND to the SIDE in FRONT of an ENCLOSURE (either your own or the opponent's),  EXTEND TO THE SIDE ANYWHERE ELSE,  lastly, JUMP to the CENTRE.]
;W[nq];B[pj]C[good.
This is a big move

TJ: Agreed.];W[hp];B[ho];W[jp];B[jn];W[ip];B[io];W[ko];B[kn]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[mp];B[dj]C[good again.
played at the right time.
The board is looking favourable for black at this stage

TJ: Agreed. White has spent too many moves in just one part of the board ("korigatachi" or "over-concentration), which has enabled Black to build up over the whole board.]
;W[no];B[ln];W[mn];B[nn];W[mm];B[nm];W[lm]
(;B[kl]C[this seems orentated to capture.  Another great lesson is that the game is about teritory , not capture.

TJ: This advice is absolutely right, but in this position White is virtually begging to be captured. Black should be able to kill or at least torture the White group for a long time: if he kills, then the resulting thick (i.e., strong) shape will decide the game instantly; if White gets away, she will have to make too many concessions over the rest of the board. Either way, White is in trouble.]
;W[nl]
(;B[ml];W[om];B[fn];W[on];B[en];W[dn]LB[gn:B][fo:A]C[if white takes A then black takes B and the other way round]
;B[fo]C[This was not urgent.];W[ep]C[sometimes it is best to leave things like this as the last 2 stones didn't achieve anything, however this may have been vital to you later on.
Dont play a move unless you have to, or it achieves something]
;B[dm];W[cn]
(;B[cr]C[This seems unreasonable

TJ: It simply does not work. White is so strong in this part of the board that the only conceivable way in which a move like this might be worthwhile is as a ko threat.]
;W[es];B[cp]C[TJ: Don't flog a dead horse. This move reduces still further your slim chances of pulling anything off here. Just leave it as it is, and perhaps try C3 as a ko threat in the event of a ko fight.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[bo];B[bq];W[dq];B[bn];W[bp];B[cm];W[do]
(;B[br]C[This is definately a wasted move.
learning the difference between an urgent move and a big move is vital.  This is neither.

Everything on the board is in a fairly settled state.  Big moves are left (which should have gone long ago), now is time to take one.]
;W[bm]
(;B[hm]C[This seems an odd response to whites last move.
now white can invade along the left side.

;B[sh];W[sg]C[Hawkeye [30k?\]: i wish i would not make moves like that

It is just a lapse in concentration - don't dwell on it otherwise the game will suffer.

TJ: Happens to everyone. A couple of minor errors won't cost you the game, but getting annoyed with yourself and losing your calm perspective on the position as a whole _will_ cost the game.]
;B[rg];W[sh];B[sf];W[rf];B[sj]C[jdumonti [29k?\]: Doh..it was my turn to make those moves 8)

TJ: Again, don't worry about it. You will make far fewer mistakes as you get stronger, but nobody stops making them altogether -- even Cho Chikun makes blunders now and then!]

C[The game has gone much better for the last few dozen moves.  Better direction and thought.
There are still big moves left and these should be taken.];W[sm]

(;B[ek];W[cj];B[dk];W[al];B[el];W[bl];B[cg]C[good!

;W[ch];B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[bg];W[dg];B[eh]
;W[df];B[ce]C[TJ: Incidentally, this 1-point jump is correct shape. Don't confuse it with the other 1-point jump to B15, which is NOT correct shape. Similar positions crop up frequently in mid-board fights, it's usually best to make the 1-point jump which results in the opponent's stone peeping (as D14 peeps at C14). If you don't understand what I mean at the moment, don't worry -- it will come to you when you've been fighting for a bit longer :-)]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[ff];B[ef]C[TJ: Magnificent! This is a spendid move that should initiate a "throw-in and squeeze" tesuji.]
;W[eg]C[TJ: Black now misses the chance to capitalise on E14. The squeezing move at F13 would allow Black to map out a huge centre.]

(;B[ee]C[F13];W[fg];B[bh]C[TJ: This and the next few moves are far too small and should be saved for the endgame. Black should try to attack White's weak group at F13 with all his might.]

(;B[pb];W[ra]C[white now has 2 eyes and is alive in the corner.
this could have been prevented, however this will come with practice too

TJ: Agreed, but with the reservation that it's normally better to seal the opponent in before hitting a vital point. After all, White cannot get out and is not forced to live very small. If Black had play S19 first, then White might have been able to escape with O18 or similar. (See previous variation.)]

before playing a move ask 'do I NEED to play here?'
if not ask 'where will secure me the most territory?'

Urgent moves, then big moves.   Never waste a move.

TJ: May I add the following things?

1) Read James Davies's _Tesuji_ and copy out examples of each kind of tesuji in a note book. This really helped me.

2) Read either or preferably both Otake Hideo _Opening Theory made Easy_ and Ishigure _In the Beginning_.

3) Play lots of games and try different ideas out. Put learning ahead of winning. Ask stronger players in your club or online (KGS is best for this) for advice -- they are often glad to help, since they, too, were beginners once.]
