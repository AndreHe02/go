C[Hi,

this game was played on KGS between me (hlksi) and Painless.  We're both

at 25k.  There were many parts that I was uncertain of, and I hope you'll

be able to help me out.  (I was white in this game)



Thanks for taking your time doing this.

I'm Andre 14k KGS. I've made lots of variations for you to study. Hope my comments help you both in studying go]

(;B[rn]LB[mn:1][lp:2]TR[np]SQ[on]C[This is the beginning of black's mistake. White is weak right now and black touching it.
The result is white's weak group becoming stronger, this should be avoided by black.
Besides, there is an opening at O4

The focus of black's opening is to make a huge early territory just like san ren sei, while white's opening focus at disrupting black's attempt and create framework for bigger territory in order to cover black's sente

Normal respond to white's P6 is O4, after that these sequence may follow

B M4];W[ro];B[rm];W[qo];B[np];W[qq];B[pq];W[qr]TR[np]C[Q :
I think it's better if I had gone Q2 here instead?

A :
playing this move at Q2 only squezees a little of black's territory and black might tenuki to attack white's unsecured corner. The O4 stone is the one that make black's tenuki possible]

(;B[cb]SQ[cd]C[Black is weak right now, so he should touch white's stone. the question is which to touch ?
I recommend touching C16 stone];W[bc];B[gf];W[eg]C[Here,

I tried to drive him to the center while having the potential to get a nice

chunk of territory on the left side later on

A :
This is an invalid respons by white. black can get a huge territory (bigger than white may get at left side) by attacking white's lonely stone at G17.]
;B[gh];W[hg]TR[ee][gf]C[White sould not peep now, coz it helps black strengthen its shape, black's shape has weak point : the keima E15-G14 can be cut with some preparation first. The preparation needed are make base for G17 and securing C16 shape]
;B[gg];W[ie]SQ[jd][qh][dl]C[Trying to build moyo

Comment :
The usual approach in building moyos are : corner-side center, there is some unusual case at shin-fuseki that people build at this pattern : center-side-corner. But at these case, both player should play at the usual approach. Left, right and upper side is not secured yet. Besides, the best way to build moyo is by chasing your enemy's weak groups

This move is bad, white loses sente, and white's upper position can be invaded at N16 to reduce or M17 to take territory. At this point, white has less terrotory than black so white should secure some territory. Instead of H13&J15, I recommend playing at the points I marked]
;B[gb];W[fb]C[Q : H18 would be better I think?

A :
Right, this is a bad respond by white. Because of this mistake, black gains eyes needed to live and white's upper side is treahened]
;B[hb];W[hc];B[fc];W[eb]SQ[fb]C[White should give up F18 stone and play at somewhere else]
;B[db];W[ei];B[gj];W[ff];B[bb]C[Black safely ignored the cut threat by white, why ? because black's upper left corner lives and its G14 group can safely connect to black's lower gorup]

Comment :
This move is better at K17, black can still sperate J18 group and Q17 group]
