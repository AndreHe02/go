C[I played Black in this game and lost by 2.5 points. It was a very enjoyable game to play but I would like to know which things I could have done better at. Thanks for any help you can provide!

I have provided brief comments in some parts describing what I may have been thinking during the game.]
;B[pd]C[windmill [10k\]: hi];W[cp]C[Talaer [11k\]: Hi, have a nice game]
;B[qp];W[op];B[oq]C[B: I would prefer to play Q6 here. Q6 fits better with the black stone on Q16 and the white stone on C4. After the standard joseki you are playing here, you get a low position, which doesnt fit to a black stone at Q16 (it would fit to a white stone on Q16). On the other hand, the white stones will fit together well after the joseki. (you will want to have a black stone at D4 after the joseki)]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[mp];B[qn]C[B: you should play Black O5, white O4, black Q5 here. This gives you a higher position, which fits well to your stone on Q16.]
;W[ip]C[B: I would say white has a tiny advantage from this opening. But: Dont  worry to much about this. The more important things happen later in the game.]
;B[dc];W[de];B[ce]C[B: Playing the same joseki again is not good for black.]
;W[ec]C[I was not expecting this and I have not seen it before. I'm not sure if it is a joseki but I felt the result I got was ok.

B: I find it strange that white doesnt play the standard joseki. The standard joseki looks good for white! I dont know this move either.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[df];W[ee];B[cf];W[db];B[cb];W[jd];B[pj]TR[cj]
C[Maybe I should have used this stone as one more on the left side after the corner exchange.

B: You have choosen the correct side to play. Q16 is your only stone which wants a little help. So playing on the right side is correct.
I would have played R13 here. Reason: white will find it hard to find an invasion point on th right side. His best point would still be R10, but from there he cannot make a good extension in either direction.

Your move Q10 is still ok. But the white invasion points R14, Q14 and Q13 are a little better for white (compared to the position after black R13 white R10)]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[qg];B[qe];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rk]
;W[pi];B[oj];W[qh];B[ol]C[B: You played this sequence very well! I would have played the same. (Except: Right now, I would have played the forcing move S10, before playing P8. If you wait with S10 for later: white might not answer later.)]
;W[oi];B[ok]C[B: Here you certainly have to play O10. P9 looks a little overconcentrated.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[ne];B[of]C[B: Good move! This might lead to an attack against the white stones on the right side later.]
;W[nf];B[og];W[ng];B[lq]C[B: No! You have to continue your attack by playing O12! This is very important! The white stones on the right side will find it very hard to live (they would have even no chance to live by themselves if you would have let slip in the forcing move S10 earlier).

The most likely outcome would be: The white stones would run out into the open on line 11 and you would run beside them on line 12, and would nullify the white moyo on the top in the process.

Even if white would somehow be able to live small on the side, you would get an advantage from that.]
;W[nr];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[lr];B[io];W[jn];B[hp];W[in];B[ho];W[km];B[ln]
;W[mq];B[lm];W[ll];B[nm]C[I felt happy with this result on the bottom. I sacrificed a couple stones to get a solid position within his framework and gave him a somewhat weak group. 
B: You are right: Locally the result is good. The more natural point to start this invasion would have been E4 (instead of your M3) .
There is one problem with that result though: It will not be easy anymore to attack the weak white group at the right!  white has now a lot of influence in the center. His stones J6,K6,L7,M8 will all help, if white has to run out with his weak group. Also: Those stones are light. white can easily sacrifice them, and give a few points to you, if there is need to do so.]
;W[jl];B[eq];W[dn];B[cm]C[Later I felt I played this too close.
B: You are right. Playing C8 is better.];W[dq];B[ep];W[cj]C[B. The right point for white is C9. After white C10 your stone at C7 looks good again!]
;B[dk]C[B: Good! White is in a difficult position now!];W[ck]
;B[dl];W[dj];B[cn];W[ek];B[co];W[bp]
(;B[cr]C[B: Your moves here are a good idea! You get the move D4 for free and you get a wall down to E2. I still think D2 would have been better here. It is hard for the white corner group to live.]
;W[dr];B[dp];W[br];B[er];W[cs]C[B: Well played!];B[el]C[B: This move is not good! It helps black to defend his defect on E10. You might want to cut at E10 later (not now). A good move would have been F12. it has two aims: either reduce the white moyo  with G13 or to cut at E10. white cannot defend against both.

your move E8 helps your stones a little, that is true. But in reality: they dont need the help so much. the white stones D10 C10, C9 need help much more. 

The exchange black E8, white E10 helped the black stones a little and the white stones a lot.

This type of move is called "thank you move". I think it is rather hard to understand why E8 is bad. Earlier in my life it took me a year to understand this. But its worth thinking about.]
;W[ei];B[fh]C[B: Still a good move!];W[ch]C[B: I think white can still play G13, but this is complicated. lets look at a variation.

The way the game went there might be no difference between playing G13 now or later.]

(;B[dg];W[fk]C[Now white has 3 separate weak groups, but they are all close to each other and I couldn't find a way to attack them very harshly at this stage. Finding the score so close at the end tells me it may have been best for me to just begin grabbing the large endgame plays first.

B: The trouble is: white has so much strength in the center. so he really is nearly impossible to attack now.
In terms of territory black has the lead. In terms of influence: white has the lead. white will probably get a lot of territory at the top. I would say: the game is rather even now. blacks main concern should be to reduce the white moyo at the top.]
;B[gg]C[B: Good!];W[ff]C[B: The way the match went, you still got your forcing move at G13. So it would not have made a difference if you would have played G13 before.]
;B[oh]C[B: Rather late, but still: Good!];W[ni];B[nh];W[mh]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[li];W[nj]C[B: Do you see, how the white stones M8,L7,K8 help white now?]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[kk]C[B: Good!];W[lj];B[kl]C[B: good!];W[gh]
(;B[jm]C[B: This is to slow! White will hardly defend his single stone at L7. Especially as he still might lose the whole group and you will keep your 2 stoneas anyway as you can also play M9 and catch M8. (you have two options: catching at K7 or playing M9, so you can wait...)]
;W[gi];B[il]C[B: now all groups are settled, the endgame begins.]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[rc];B[rd];W[pe];B[qf];W[qc];B[qd];W[rf];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[ob];W[qa];B[pb];W[nb];B[sc]C[B: This is a wasted move. your group has so much more liberties then those stones. Also: white doesnt have a good move here. so you can still play this move much later. 

E18 is big!];W[kj];B[jk];W[ii];B[fi];W[gj]C[B: White should play F10 here. After black G10 he could play H9 and catch the cutting stone.]
;B[fj];W[ej]TR[gk]C[For some reason during the game I feared that if I cut here I'd simply press him into my bottom side territory and still have him live somehow. I decided to not be risky.

B: cutting would have been the right move. You are not risking so much territory. Maybe about 12 points on line 6 and 7. But the way you play you end in gote! If you loose those 12 points but get to play B13 in sente, and still can play E18 then, even if he lives, you get those 12 points back elsewere.

Besides: White will probably never have time to grab those 12 points, as he has to make a living on the side.

Dont look to much to keep your territory! Make attacking move if it brings your oponent into difficulties!
For developing a strength in Go, I think this is very important.

I know there are situations, were you shouldnt try to kill a group, if it runs into your moyo. But this here is not like that.

Even if you dont kill, playing G9 will be good.]
(;B[fl];W[gl];B[hk]C[B: bad forcing move.
you should just play G7. Later you might want to play Atari at H8 instead of your H9]

;W[ps];B[rs];W[os];B[eb]C[I try not to get too pushed around in the endgame this game.

B: Very good move! If you want it is a refutation of whites monkey at the bottom. Your move is far bigger then answering at S2]
;W[fb];B[da];W[hm];B[hn];W[fm];B[gn];W[hl];B[im]C[B: This move is not as big as it might look.
Moves at F19, O19, S10 and B13 are all far bigger.];W[cl];B[dm]
;W[bg];B[rj]C[B: Good!];W[ri];B[af]C[B: No! why dont you play R11? white is in a difficult position then: either he plays Q12, then the exchange was very good for you. or he gives you a very big Ko (as he might loose all his stones on the right side).]
;W[bf];B[be];W[ag]C[B: small move!];B[na]C[B: good!];W[ma];B[oa]
;W[mb];B[ae]C[B: No! Play F19 or R11, give him the few points.]

;W[rg];B[tt];W[pg];B[sa];W[tt];B[tt]C[Again, thanks for any advice you can provide me on how to improve my game overall.

B: my overall impression: you play very well. you sort of start the attacks well: you play so that your oponent gets weak groups. but you never really attack those groups. your oponent never really has to be afraid of you.

you played your endgame better then your oponent. that made the result so close at the end. with an even better endgame you would have won.

At some point you write:
"Finding the score so close at the end tells me it may have been best for me to just begin grabbing the large endgame plays first."
In a certain sense you are right. In a certain sense it is even exactly what you did. If you would have done it a little bit more efficient, you would even have had success.

But: I think for you, to become a well balanced Go player, the main thing you should learn is, to attack.

I think you have choosen the game very well. Looking at it closer, you might be able to learn a lot.]
