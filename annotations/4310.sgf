C[hi thanks in advance for the review

Any general comments would be appreciatedand i have a couple questions throughout, thanks again.  Im espesially interested in opening and early middle game.  i think they're my weakest areas

Dakre: hi Jack. This was a difficult game for both sides it seems. And white was somehow lucky that she won the game. there are many moves which could have make you win this game and some of them you have already seen for yourself. Very good. Also you have a good sense for the situation for example when to tenuki. But maybe it is the fighting, when the stones are very close to each other, which you could improve on. I hope you have fun reading this commentary.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc]LB[cd:A]C[Dakre: this isn't too serious but a slight mistake... because the 3-4 point has a direction it wants to develop... and this is facing in this case the left side where a 4-4 stone is sitting with good influence neglecting you a decent development. so maybe A would have been better]
;W[pp];B[ce];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd]LB[rd:A]C[i believe the joseki is ws16, b r17 but wasnt sure how to finish, can you show some variations? (i know thats for white but i was curious)

Dakre: White at A would be a great mistake... see the variation for a common joseki in this situation and why A is a mistake ;)]

(;W[mf];B[qk];W[qm];B[pg];W[pf];B[ng];W[nf]C[should i have saved these peeps for later?

Dakre: no, very good timing... first peep then defend!!! a general rule... now it is ideal for black to defend at the top, because it is even more worth after white became stronger]
;B[kd]LB[ld:A]C[Dakre: but this one is a bit too loose... better play at A... there is too much aji around... especially with the corner...]
;W[rd]C[Dakre: bad move for white... gives you the opportunity to save the corner... and white almost doesn't make any territory!!]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[dn]LB[cn:A]C[Dakre: nice tenuki here! but the high approach on a 4-4 is rarely correct ;) better play at A]
;W[dj]LB[cg:A][cl:B]C[i think d8 might have been better (drive d10 towards my stong stones) but a one space extension seemed so small, what are your thoughts?

Dakre: D10 doesn't have a good continuation. A and B would be too near to the stone. Pressing D10 against your top and strong corner may be a good idea... you could achieve this with a double approach and strengthen yourself by leaning against the 4-4 stone]
;B[dh]C[Dakre: this seems to be a bit overconcentrated for black on the top, but possible]
;W[dl];B[fn]LB[dl:B][fq:A]C[maybe you could abandon D6 and play at A... it has done it's job and white made a small defensive move at B]
;W[fp];B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[dm];B[em];W[cn]LB[ej:A]C[Dakre: good result for white!! groups connected and the whole corner is whites... what did you get? some influence but you'd still need to play at A... and it's facing nomans land :/ at least a ko in the corner for later...]

this was a reading err on my part

Dakre: you're very right!!! C2 is the move now... white's E1 was a big mistake, too... white instead should have played D1... see the variation]

;W[pk];B[pj];W[ol];B[nk]C[Dakre: you're defending the wrong side... in the middle to the left... there is the black territory... and you don't need to maintain a connection when you can live at the side...]

C[looking afterwards  i didnt reaaly like this move cause of the gap at e13, but everyothwer move in the area seemed too slow (like e13 or e14 i was thinking) your thought?

Dakre: i think F14 doesn't do any good... it doesn't make territory because white has already a foot under your skirt at A. it is too late now... a bit earlier you had chances to make some territory in the marked area.]

well thats the game, thanks again for the review bye

Dakre: a few things you should remember in your future games... one of them is shape... this is a topic all the time and becomes especially important, when stones touch each other like at E8... 
Another thing is the order of moves, which was important at p2... there you could have done a lot better. Don't pay too much attention to the endgame, that was quite ok and doesn't seem to be as value as to improve on your middlegame and your positional judgement.
I hope the commentary was helpful for you. If you have any questions left, mail me.]
