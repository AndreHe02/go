C[Hi, I will try to answer your questions and show you other possibilities but I am only 4k* in igs so dont take my suggestions as absolute truth.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[laver: Chinese Opening. I like it. This period I'm trying to carefully study and exploit it.

I also play it many times. I think it lets black have the iniciative though the opening.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[laver: I felt white's joseki a bit overconcentrated in this situation.
Anyway, I didn't know how to get advantage of that, so I reluctantly went to the lower-left corner

I think the joseki that both had played is very usual and good for this situation.
I you play a pincer against w o17, you destroy your right side moyo when white invades at r17.]
;B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[laver: Chinese Opening theory reccomends K4 rather than D2, but I was fearing H3...

True, b K4 is the usual move, but j3 or d2 are played often also.

K4 has a good balance with all the black right side stones. H3 is a weak spot for black but there are counter measures. Look at variations.]
;W[cq]LB[cq:A];B[iq];W[cj]
(;B[fc]C[laver:
I thought it was better to invade on the top now, taking advantage of white's
joseki I felt a bit overconcentrated before...

I think white is not overconcentrated at top, but a bit too low with o17 and l17 on the third line.

Another possibility is to invade directly at c17]
(;W[hc]LB[ec:B][hc:A]C[laver: What do you think about white's move? What about something like E17?
See
my variation

Look at my commentary at the end of the variation.];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[ed]
(;B[bc]C[This is not the usual move for black. Look at the variation. It is not bad in any case.]
;W[ec]C[laver: White here is deviating
frokm the standard joseki. I think this move is a bit aji keshi, even if
I was unable to gain anything in that sequence.

You could have done an exchange, giving him the top while destroying the left side.]

(;B[eb]
(;W[bd]
(;B[fb]C[laver:
Is this a wasted move? My idea was to definitely strengthen my group while
giving black the big endmove J19...

I think it is not mandatory after b17 is played. But if you dont play it white could attack you while making a really big moyo on the left. So probably a good move giving you options for later as the actual game showed.]
;W[dg]C[This is very small for white, because he is not in danger.]
;B[mp]C[laver: Trying to follow
Chinese Opening's strategy, I didn't do shimari, but I made more and more
difficult any possible invasion in the lower-right corner, while developig
a large scale mojo.

The game now is a moyo fight, so the player that could get the bigger part of the center will surely win. Now the boundaries of the moyos are the biggest points, f5, o15 for example.]
;W[pn]C[laver: very light move, perhaps it's even possible not to reply and play something like F5?

yes, but i prefer to attack from the distance while making my moyo bigger with p9.]
;B[ok]C[And that is what you played. Great :)

Now white has a weak stone and must secure it. Black can attack it and get points and influence in the center that is the most important area of the board now.]
;W[qq]C[laver: My thoght was that R3 is too wide, so I cut. What do you propose here?]

(;B[qp]C[I think this is the only big mistake you did in the whole game.

White is weak so it is looking for sabaki. You should not give him an easy way to live.

He will live, because there are enough room, but he should pay a big ramson for it.]
;W[pp]C[laver: Aaargh! What to do next?

Now it is too late. No good continuation.

When you hane, r4, you must be ALWAYS prepared for the cut.]
;B[oq];W[qo]
(;B[rp]C[s4 is also very bad for black. Look at variation.]
;W[rq];B[op];W[po];B[nm]C[laver:
I was not completely satisfyed about my moves in the corner. My idea, with
moves like N4, was to make hard for with any attempt to invade...
With lived without problems. My only advantage was that now white had been sealed in, but in gote...

I dont like o7, it is gote and dont make anything for black. e10, f5, n15 ... are much more important now. It is a fight between moyos so the first to play get the opportunity to make it bigger.]
;W[jp]C[this is a very good move for white. It helps his moyo while makes blacks moyo flat on the bottom.]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[kq]C[laver: my way of playing has been rather passive, but I had no idea about how to avoid that...]
;W[fo]C[laver:
Aargh! That would have been my next move! Too late! I could do something
like O15, but my feeling was that white's mojo were a bit bigger, thanks
to the successful invasion in the lower-right corner...
So I tried to reduce white's mojo. But how to do that?

Now white is leading because he is threatening to get the whole center.

I would have played at f10 to reduce it.];B[ej]
(;W[gj]C[laver:
White here was really aggressive. That should be a good time for making a
nice sabaki, but I always have no idea about how to do that...

Only very strong players know how to play sabaki. But the main idea is to get away not letting white to take everything. You should remember that you are under strong attack so dont try to save every stone you played.

In this position i would have played e12]
(;B[fh];W[fi]C[laver: Ok, let's sacrifice E10, but which is the best way? No idea...]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[dh];W[di];B[ge];W[ch];B[gh];W[he]C[laver:
white takes the left side, and it has still great influence on the bottom.
Not
a success for black, I thought. But I welcome this move of white, that gave
me the opportunity to set my group in  the center

White territory is quite large at bottom left but black has managed to run away. Not bad.]
;B[hf];W[ie];B[if];W[je];B[ih]C[laver: at that point I felt black's group much safer...

Yes, he has many possibilities to connect.];W[kg]C[laver: but white was making territory everyhere and there!

L13 is a move in the right direction and with a good, bad for you:), idea behind.

It makes two things, attacks black and get into the center.]
;B[ij];W[ne];B[ng]C[laver:
I decided to respond to that move to try to keep my mojo, even if that could
make more pressure on my group in the center. Anyway, if attacked, I thought
that F16 and  L11 were miai.

Without o13 white could have devastated black right side with r12 or q11.]
;W[qb]C[laver: Finally, a move I didn't have to respond to!
I began my attack from the lower side. Probably white L11 was enormous...

Yes, it is very important to keep the iniciative. r18 is quite big, but attacking has priority always.]
;B[ho]C[Very good move, probably the winning move.];W[gp];B[gq]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[in];W[hn]C[laver:
here whites leaves any hope on the 2-stones group. Is that the wise choice?

I think he has not other choices now so he tries to make his left side moyo as big as he could.]
;B[jo];W[go];B[hm];W[io];B[jm]C[laver: Perhaps J7 would have been better. What do you think?]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[cr]C[I would have played g7 instead of c2, big but gote again.]

(;B[dq]C[laver:
I think to respond to that move has been a great error in my match. What
do you think about something like F8, or F7? (especially having played J7
rather than K7...)

I think j7 is very very big. It is a pity to "see it" after the game is played.]
;W[gm]C[laver: Too late:(];B[hl];W[gl];B[lh]C[laver:
A move to make mojo become territory. I was unsure about where to play that
move. I think here white has great opportunity for reduction.

Good move, I dont think white has many posibilities for making trouble here, because black is very strong at bottom.]

(;W[rl]C[laver: I think black in S7 would have been a great sente move, but I didn't see it during the match...

Yes, it is sente for both, double sente, so it is a urgent move.]
;B[rk];W[ql];B[ep]C[laver:
only now I did realize that jose had been started (:)). From this point on,
I was trying to keep sente

Sente is always important but at the endgame decisive.];W[do]
;B[mf];W[sk]C[laver: I'm not sure whether
N14 was a bad move. The idea was to strongly reduce L13's aji, in order not
to let white reduce black's mojo, while reducing white's one at the same
time. But white got sente...

Not bad, but it has no strong threath behind it, so white get sente.]
;B[sj];W[sl];B[rj];W[pl];B[ol];W[pc];B[rc];W[od];B[pe];W[pk]
;B[pj];W[hk]C[laver: To me white did not make a big move. I continued my attack.]
;B[le]C[So white go on with his :)]
(;W[il]C[In my opinion is better j9];B[jl];W[im]C[laver: What I didn't notice is that white's attack does not end in gote. Shit...

When you dont answer an opponent move, you must read carefully the position so to be sure there are no nasty surprises.]
;B[ho];W[ld]C[This is another opportunity lost by white. There are many sente moves.]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[jf]C[laver:
I think this has been great for black. The situation was a lot of aji for
white to reduce, and now black has increased territory!

Yes, black has almost all the center and that is where this game was to be won or lost.]

the final 1-point ko. That was a mess to me. Are you able to find out further

I dont see any more. Anyway that ko is half point, and you were winning by more so there is no need for fighting it.]

In my opinion your style is very unbalanced toward making territory and  you avoid fights (at least in this game) but it is very solid for your level.
I recommend you that you try in your games to invade a bit more so you have to fight and this way improve your style. You have a good sense of iniciative also.]
