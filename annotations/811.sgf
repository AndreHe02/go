AB[jd][jp][pj][dj][jj][pp][dd][pd][dp]C[This is my first win over a pro :)
Well, I know _I_ made mistakes, and as to the pro moves, I am
not so sure he played so flawlessly as well, and in any event
there are several points I totally baffled by his move, for example
move 107 (I thought the group was just dead).

I'd like to hear you opinion.
JW.

I am happy to comment your game. However, keep in mind that only
a high ranking pro can know the truth about go. My comments are
merely opinions that may help stimulate your thinking.

C[Of course the black stones perceive that his stones are weak
and need help; whereas, they white stones are always fearsome.
Suggest you visit www.wingsgoclub.org book section and freely
download the English language translation of "How To Play Against
The Stronger Player "vol. 1 and vol. 2

In the game, generally help the more inside stone get out. That
is the corner one. The side one still has multiple directions
to move.]
(;B[lq]LB[nn:D][np:C][oq:B][dn:A]TR[jp]C[B4: This common error among K players is incorrect for two reasons;
namely

1. It breaks the guideline of corner, side, center, and
2. It squeezes a white stone already squeezed (by K4).

A is the orthodox move.

or, the sequece B, C, D instead of B4 is an agressive way, since
Black does not have to absolutely answer G4, but may accept a
potential dbl attack in the corner for gaining the initiative.]

to attack. See variation.];W[fp];B[gq];W[hq];B[ep];W[ip];B[jo]

would be doable.];W[df];B[fd];W[md];B[pf];W[hd]
(;B[jf]C[B22: instead, better move inside stones to outside with F14.]
;W[gf]C[Now white is still thin (after all black has 9H).  May some vulgar
moves to simply separate white? See variation.]
(;B[cd]C[Defense first. Okay.];W[gj]C[In a case like this, typical, you have 3 choices:

run, live, sacrifice.

If you aren't confident you can just make w as small as possible
via sacrifice, see variation. I'm not saying you should do this,
only pointing out an option.]
(;B[cl];W[cm]C[So, you decided to make a living. Then think this way. Play as
many FORCING moves as you can, ending with a fast gote move to
live.]
(;B[bl]C[B28: this is not much of a forcing move, so it's slack.]

;B[qc];W[pg]C[Black must help Q14 stone get more liberties; black has cut points
among stones upper right. How about just P14 now? Get liberty
and move to outside.

liberties
