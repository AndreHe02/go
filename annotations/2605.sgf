C[Hi, this was a game i've played recently against a friend and i generally thought it was a good game. I'm not really thinking anything we did was generally wrong most of the time (apart from the obvious mistakes ;p), i'm just wondering if there was anything that could of been better.

Cheers,

(;B[gd]C[derek83 [3k\]: should be F16
derek83 [3k\]: theres aji around that area that can be exploited later... so F16 or F17 area usually]
;W[dj]LB[nc:B][nd:C][qf:A][dg:F][rp:E][fq:D]C[derek83 [3k\]: A-F are good possible plays here]

(;B[pg]C[derek83 [3k\]: black not care about white moyo?? :)
derek83 [3k\]: plus Q14 is too close to Q10, it should be placed elsewhere]

(;W[jd]C[derek83 [3k\]: hmm this move is the right idea but should be a little lower, K17 area makes much more sense]

derek83 [3k\]: nono you just ignored shoulder hit so pay the price :P]
