C[Anton: Dear reviewer, in this game I didn't even notice how I lost the beginning. It is probably my weakest area, and so far I do not even know what my mistakes are. Could you please comment on specific moves, and also give general pointers as to where I should concentrate my thinking when playing fuseki. Thank you for your time and patience!

Hi, my name is Darrell, Snip (6k) on KGS.  I'll do my best!  Please feel free to ask any followup questions.]

(;W[dp]C[Anton: Now I think that I could probably play d2 instead, since connection between c3 and d5 looks unbreakable at this point.

D:  D4 is not a good move.  It's not terrible, but it leaves your stones overconcentrated -- too many stones too close together, not really doing much.  Black's on the other hand have very nice shape.  See variation for an example of a normal response.]
;B[cp];W[eo];B[dn];W[qf];B[nc];W[fc]C[Anton: May be I should have secured a base for r14 before switching to another area with f17?

D:  A matter of taste I think.  I would be inclined to play a move around Q10 at this point.  You are not behind, so an invasion just picks a fight where your opponent is stronger than you are.  I generally prefer to stake out a moyo (potential territory) and try to force my opponent to invade where I am stronger.]
;B[hc]
(;W[fe]C[D:  The usual answer to this pincer is to jump into the corner.  That is what I would do here.  See previous variation.

It is possible to jump out this way when you are afraid of giving black too much outside influence.  I also show the usual sequence for that here.]
;B[cf]
(;W[gf]LB[id:C][rd:E][pj:A][em:D][jp:B]C[Anton: Or should it have been f13 and running away instead? I didn't make this move at the time because it didn't look threatening enough for black. Still doesn't look threatening enough.

D:  I agree.   This move really doesn't do anything.  You don't actually have to run away any more right now if you don't want to.  Any of these moves look good to me.]
;B[kd]
(;W[qj]C[Anton: Is r10 too far? This was later exploited by black to build a big wall.

D:  It is a funny spot.  Q10 works out better.  If you just want to make a territorial extension along the right side, do it as shown in the variation.]
;B[dj];W[jp]C[Anton: Now I think m3 would be better to strenghten the lower-right corner a little.

D:  I don't know.  I think this is fine.  There is no single move that is going to turn that vast side of the board into territory.]
;B[mp];W[kn]LB[kq:A]C[Anton: Another option was r6 - yet I was worried about the f15 group and getting it sealed off from the main forces.

D:  This is a funny move.  There is much more territory potential along the side than in the middle.  Just play at 'a' and black has a hard time making a base, plus you take profit along the bottom.]
;B[pq]
(;W[op]C[Anton: Or r4, may be even r3 - though I am not comfortable with cross-cuts at all.

D:  This move simply gives black the entire corner.  It is very bad.  R3 would be fine.  See variation.]
;B[oq];W[of]C[Anton: I feel that this was a mistake - I should have strengthened lower-right before pressing to the center. Then I wouldn't be so forced with the next move by black.

D:  Agreed];B[pi]
(;W[pm];B[pg];W[qg]C[Anton: Here (and for most of the game) I was more worried about territory than anything else.]

(;W[rd]C[See variation];B[rc];W[rg]C[D:  This move was not needed.]
;B[mi];W[fj]LB[db:C][lq:B][qq:A]C[Anton: Looking at how the board developed after this, I think that it could be wiser to use the p14 stone (sacrificing it though) and try to erase some of the moyo in that area by quickly escaping.

D:  P14 has become worthless.  I like these moves.  They all expand your territory while reducing blacks.]
;B[el]C[Anton: It is almost as if white's f10 forced black to increase its moyo.]
;W[eh];B[ch];W[lq];B[mq];W[nn]C[This move doesn't do anything.  There is no possibility of terrritory out there.]
;B[qq]C[Good move by black.  Expanded his territory and reduces whites.]
;W[qp];B[kg]C[Anton: After this move I was scraping for at least some more points, yet even I realized that the game looked completely lost. I resigned only when the territories were much more defined, when I could certainly see the score and there were no chances for black to make significant mistakes.

D:  You did a good job of keeping your groups alive and not getting surrounded.  Really, you only made a couple of poor moves, but black took good advantage of them.  I hope this review helps.  -Darrell-]

The go proverb is, when crosscut, extend.

You can extend to any of the marked points.  Let's try 'D' do see how it goes.]
