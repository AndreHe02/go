C[Hello Ronald,
     My name is Yimeng Huang and I am about 7k AGA (9k* on IGS).  So bear in mind that my comments and suggestions below are what I see at my level and may not be the "correct" answer.

     My comments will be mostly from the white's point of view since white has requested the game review and white payed against a much stronger player.

      Here are some general points I want to emphasize for white about the game.  I can tell you are still a beginner player.  You have the good basic ideas about getting territory, reducing the oponent's moyo but often you waited too long to do it effectively.  W needs to improve basic life and death reading skills; the two w groups on the left should not have died.  Get a book on life and death.  You also should do some reading about beginning.         W should learn to play "light" earlier in the game.  Try to position yourself on the whole board at the beginning.  Think of big point moves.   Try to avoid playing your stones too close to each other (too slow, not effective).  It's a common weakness among beginner.            Each time when you play your move, think of where your oponent would play in response.  If his response move is going to give more benifit for him than your move to yourself, you need to think twice.  See example during the game.

    Before you start reviewing the game, please turn on the "Show Next Move" option in your game viewer.  If you have already done so, you should see a letter A on Q4 as the first move.  I will refer to A as the next move below.
     I hope my comments will encourage (not discourage) you to continue to play and enjoy this wonderful game!

[rm]LB[qq:B][qc:C]C[w's playing at A is a "thank you" move for b, forcing b to make a solid shape at the bottom right. Before playing A, it's probably time for white to get in to the corners at B and/or  C before it's too late.]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[ql];B[rm];W[rl];B[om];W[qe]LB[qc:B]C[Same thing, w A is forcing b to secure the big top.  Should be B.  It's sure to live since b is still pretty open there.]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf]C[W got something but look what HUGE territory black has got!  As a principle, when you play a move, always think how your opponent is going to respond to your move.  If by his response, he is going to make more profit for himself than your move for yourself, then it's not a good move (unless it's urgent, to make yourself alive for example).]

;W[ci];B[dh];W[bi];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[em];B[fm]C[At this point, white should be aware that you could be sealed in.  Important question to ask yourself, do I have two eyes? can I be sure to make two eyes.  A doesn't really help with making two eyes.]
;W[dl];B[fl]C[This A doesn't help much either and it's small.  Should play the crucial point to make two eyes, be a live and transfer the focus to somewhere else on the board where there are bigger points to be made.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[bn];B[bm];W[bl];B[bo];W[am];B[an]LB[bk:B]C[W should play B to ensure two eyes.]
;W[al];B[bk];W[ah]C[This is too bad for white;  A is a common way to take away to two eyes. However, there might be a way that white could make a seki out of it.  In case you are not familiar with it, seki is a situation where both b and w stones are alive .  See Variation.]

(;W[dj];B[eh];W[ap];B[lg];W[cm];B[bn];W[fn]C[There is a ladder bad for white.  Should see that.]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[fp];W[ag];B[af]LB[cc:B][bc:C]C[Know that there is a bad peep that black can play at B, my instinct would be for w to play at C to create eye shape.]
;W[ae];B[cc];W[dc];B[de];W[cd];B[bc]LB[fb:B][bb:C]C[A doesn't help much to make 2 eyes.  Two thing w could think of trying:  play B to try to get out and also increase eye space. Or play at C to try to kill b 2 stones and make two eyes to live.  See V.]

[kr]N[Final Result]C[I strongly suggest that white at this stage work on two important aspects: basic life and death problems, and "get stong at beginning".  There is a good book by this title.   I benifited greatly by reading this book.  It teaches you how to position yourself strategically at the beginning, how to find the biggest moves on the board.  It really helped me to correct my beginner's bad habbit of making small point moves at the beginnning.  Even when a situation doesn't look settled yet or there is three stones you can catch, just leave it there for now, there might be MUCH BIGGER moves on the board that you should play first.  It's so important at this stage to improve your strength.   Good luck!  Hope you don't give up but continue to enjoy Go and improve your skills.

(;W[bj]LB[dj:A][ak:C][bj:B]C[Black instead of playing at A, can play at B to threathen to play at C to be a live.  If W responds by playing at C instead to kill the two eyes, W can then play at A, making a seki.  Continue to see the result.]
;B[ak];W[dj]LB[ai:A][ck:B]C[Once the situation is like this, it's a seki. Think about it.  W cann't kill the b stones; will kill himself if he tries.   B cann't kill white either.  Imagine if there is no more liberties on the white's outside, b still cannot play A or B to put w in atari, because then w can take the b stones (a shape called L-4) and still make 2 eyes however b plays.]
