(;B[dq]C[There is no rush to invade here.  I think it is better to see how white tries to develop the bottom before coming in.  Since there are a lot of places you can play (C3, D3, E3, F3) you can't know right now which is the best.  After white makes another move in this area you can make a better judgement about where to play.  Later in this you play J17 to form the chinese opening.  I think it would be better to just play there now.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[ep]
(;B[fq]C[Since white has a ston at R4, I would probably play more the solid connection here.  When you play as you did it gives white a lot of options.]

(;B[hp]TR[do][qp]MA[hq][iq]C[What is honte here, considering R4 / D5 ?

I would just play J3 to make a base.  When white has R4 and a strong group at D4, fighting in this area will be good for white.  After H4, you will need another move in this area to make a strong group.]
;W[ck]
(;B[ic]TR[ck]C[is the chinese still relevant with C9 ?

This would have been a better move earlier, but I don't think it is terrible now.  What will you do if white plays D16?

Personally, I would make the group on the bottom stronger, say with M3.  Now white has about 15 points on the left, and black has about 15 points on the bottom.  White has R4 and black has C16, which are about the same, plus black has Q16, but white has the move.  Looks like an even game to me.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]
(;B[np]C[Is this too soft ?

I did not want to get closer, in order to avoid a pincer, because I thought bottom left still not stabilised.

I think P3 would be OK in this position. See the variation.  it is difficult for white to pincer here because of the stone at R11, which is on the third line.  It will be difficult for white to make a bigger area on the right than black can make on the bottom.]
;W[pm];B[kq]C[I think it would be better to play here before O4.]
;W[ed]
(;B[dd]C[Why do you want to make this stone stronger?  If you want to touch the E16 stone, why not play E17 so you get the corner. 
There is a proverb "Dont touch a weak stone" that applies here. You don't have to touch this stone at all.]
;W[ec];B[cg]LB[cg:A][ch:B]C[Over concentrated, but C12 too risky (I think)

I think the ths three space extension is OK.   if white plays C14 there will be two weak whit groups. It will be difficult to save both of them when playing inside blacks area.]
;W[cb];B[ee];W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[fe];B[ef];W[gg]
(;B[eh]C[This is not that important.  The E15 group is already alive, so it can't be attacked, and this doesn't really make the E14 group much stronger.  I think something like p13, expanding the top right would be bigger.]
;W[lf]
(;B[nf]C[I preferred this to M16, because of W follow-up at O14, and because it is better to have the ladder when invading at R9 later

I would just defend the top territorry.   You don't want J17 to become a weak group that white can attack.  If white gets something in the center out of M14/O14 it will be less than if your stones come under attack.]
;W[ld];B[lb];W[mc]C[You territory on the top is seriously damaged now, and white has a significant lead.]
;B[nc];W[mb];B[kc];W[lc];B[jb]C[Now black has two weak groups.  The game will be difficult now.]
;W[lh];B[nh];W[ig];B[pq]C[Do you really have time to do this?  What if white plays H18? Are you sure the black group can live?  If not, the game is over.]

(;W[qq];B[gb]C[This "should" end in sente for B

Why do you say that?  White is connected to the outside and can make a base in the corner with B17.   How does the play go after white takes the big point at S17?]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[hc];B[hb];W[fd]
(;B[qk]C[Is this the correct timing ?
If not, a White play at P10 seems dreadful.

Hmmm.  How does this prevent white from playing P10 or Q9?  Even if you can live with the R9 stone, your top right group will be in trouble.  This invasion deprives white of about 10-12 points on the right side, but doesn't threaten to kill anything, so it is only worth the 10-12 points.  S17 makes the top right group more secure and is worth at least 10 points.

You need to count the score.  Suppose you take S17 and white takes Q10 as you fear.  That gives white about 30 points on the right, 15 points on the left and a few in the top center for a total of maybe 50 + komi. You have the move, and about 20+ points on the bottom, maybe 10 in the upper left,  5 in the upper center and at least 5 in the upper right, for a total of  40.  You are a little behind, but you have the move, so the game is still playable.

Any other big point ?

I think R2 is pretty big right now, even though it loses sente.]

(;W[qm]C[White is very nice to you!!];B[pj];W[rc]C[This is a really big point for both sides.  A pro once told me it is worth about 17-18 points.]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[pg];B[og];W[oq];B[nq]LB[op:B][nq:A]C[The problem here was caused by the R9 move.  Black had to maintain the connection to the outside, and lost sente, allowing white to take this big point.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[op];B[oo];W[po];B[no]TR[kq]C[I think W got enormous profit in this exchange.

Now L3 achives nothing.

Any good way to have prevented this, by attacking somewhere at earlier stage  (like, play Q2 after W R2) ?

I think the invasion at R9 was the problem.   In any case, there is no reason to play O5.  Take a big move somewhere else, like C11.]
;W[on];B[rj];W[ri];B[rl];W[rm]
(;B[ek]LB[ek:A][cm:B]C[was an invasion at C7 possible, and how to deal with  (I tried to see possible paths) ?

I don't think C7 is possible without some support from the outside.  Maybe C11 would make it it workable, though, and that also takes some points for black.  The D9 move doesn't make any points.


>From here on out is just endgame fighting.  I think white is a litte ahead.   Both players made mistakes in the endgame.

I think the biggest mistake in this game was the invasion at R9.   If white encloses this area it is worth about 10-12 points.  I think taking S17 is just as big, and if white defends against R9, then black can save Q3 for and additional 10 points.  You don't always have to invade big area's like this, sometimes just reducing them is big enough.]
