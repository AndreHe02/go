;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pq]C[A diagonal opening is very rare, since both player must agree on it. It strikes me a bit as a psycological game to invite a diagonal opening; "I think I am good enough at the diagonal opening, but if you think you're better, go ahead and play it" and when black takes the challenge, a tight fighting game tend to follow.]
;B[mp];W[po];B[pj];W[de]C[Seems a bit small and slow to me, but it's solid enough. If you get to chase one of blacks groups around, you can probably win it easilly.

An alternative is answering black and taking immediate profit with r8.]
;B[qm];W[qn]C[This is almost always a bad idea; it strenghtens the lone stone, and does not add anything significant to your group compared to the alternatives like s5 q7 o5 etc.]
;B[pm];W[jd]C[I thought the bottom right was secure enough to leave alone. This seemed to me to be a big point (extension in front of a shimari)

it is big, but blacks n4 stone should be exploited while it is weak. Black can now play on a large scale with n7 or o6, and keep your corner closed in.]
;B[qp];W[pp];B[rn]
(;W[ro]LB[qo:B][ro:A];B[qo];W[pn];B[rp]C[This is a standard sequence, it's well advised to read up on (or study alot of games to see) the various combinations that occur in the corners.]

(;W[rm]C[doesn't really add any aji, more likely removes it, as black now lives on the inside and can crawl into the corner. I suggest s3 if you feel you must play in the area.]
;B[so];W[qq];B[rq];W[rr]
(;B[sq];W[nq]C[better to jump into the center with a move like o6; you're just making black strong where he needs to be with a move like this.]
;B[mq];W[om]C[better];B[ol];W[nm];B[ld]C[Black now has a double wing formation. Already here I would consider invading the corner, perhaps with r14 first.]
;W[cn]C[Should I have invaded at the bottom instead of this pincer(?)? I think black get's too much territory at the bottom in the end. Maybe first F3 and then C6?

Don't be afraid of giving your opponent territory or influence, as long as you make sure to grab the same amount for yourself. This move can help build a moyo on the left side stretching into the center.

Another alternative is to answer blacks m16 aproach by playing k14]
;B[dl];W[cq]C[If you wanted to invade the corner, the c6/d8 exchange only hurts your position; play the 3-3 point immediately. Besides, invading the corner here is too early, and lets black (again) get strong where he wants to be.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]
;B[co];W[bn]C[I would sacrifice this stone, what you do is force black to threaten your corner, and create another group you must narrowly save while your opponent build up influence.]

;B[ar]C[I didn't see this seki being formed, however, I think there are bigger points on the board, so even if I had seen it, I wouldn't have played differently.

Well, black is wrong for making an 8 point seki in gote, but you shouldn't have left the option open in any case. If black was smart he'd played elsewhere, and would have taken the seki later anyway, when 8 points was big enough. If you'd seen the seki and still played to induce it, you'd be relying on tricking black to give up sente.]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[fk]C[With this move I intended to expand my territory on the left while keeping black's territory limited. I think my mistake at the top spoiled it in the end.
Yet, even now it seems a bit small perhaps when looking at the territory black gets, considering my left side seems still open to invasion.

No, this is a huge move, and correctly placed. Blacks "territory" on the bottom now has two open sides (from the top with f9 and from the left with o7), while your territory is almost secure, black can only hope to reduce it or expand his on similarilly by playing m10]

General advice would be to avoid making your opponent stronger. Play away from aproach moves, escape to the center instead of blocking off territory-grabs on the edge,and generally avoid weak stones until you see a good way to exploit it.

Also, don't be too concerned about your opponent making profit. Don't try to kill your opponent, or try to make sure he has no territory, as in most cases, you can't, and create weaknesses for yourself.  Try to win by 10 points or so, by always being just a bit ahead in territory and influence. Don't reduce in the middlegame, save it for the endgame, and instead play where you both have potential to create influence.

Most moves that look huge aren't; you take alternating turns, and go is a game of give and take.]
