(;B[ci]C[[Vador\] I see what you are trying to do, but it looks a bit small. B16, and then C11, would be better, I think.]
;W[ck];B[gq]C[G3 looks small now but I have a generel problem about living at corners, you'll see later :)

[Vador\] Problem is G3 doesn't seem to protect the corner very well. E4 or maybe F4 would be better, I think.]
;W[pc]C[I have planned to move R17 before but didn't expect this from white. This must be a punishment for G3

[Vador\] this is a completly normal move from white. You can't have everything on the board. The main idea is to SHARE it. If you protect more some place, you have to let your opponent play some moves of his own in another part of the board.]

(;B[kc]C[[Vador\] Typical : you don't like what opp builds, so you try to invade.]

(;W[mc];B[hc]C[[Vador\] This is really too small. And it would be even more if your opponent had pushed you the other way.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[qi]C[I couldn't be sure about this move, should I play somewhere else?

[Vador\] Joseki is O3, but it looks a bit overcrowded. Problem is, you didn't play before on the east side, so now your opp is doing it. So you have to "invade" from nothing.]
;W[oq]C[[Vador\] this is going too far from W. You should punish him.]

;B[ld];W[md];B[le];W[me]
(;B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[gd]C[[Vador\] now W is protecting himself by forcing you. If you play contact moves, thats what you induce your opp to]

(;B[ql];W[oi]C[I am not sure but R 8-11-14 must live somehow?

[Vador\] R14 is quite alone. Better to move first towards center, and later establish a living base for the group.]
;B[ol]C[May I have a general comment about my opening?

[Vador\] My impression is that your stones are not fully working together. There are too many small, unsafe groups. But that doesn't mean it's bad. You have to do something with your east group, and maybe your north group. And look at your opps groups too. Which are safe (NE), which are not (NW, W, S).]
;W[nn];B[om]C[[Vador\] this is meaningless (I think)];W[on]
;B[ml];W[lo];B[pf];W[of]C[[Vador\] and THIS must be answered. Or you'll have lost TWO stones instead of one.]

;B[nj]C[I thought white is going to have great potential in the middle O10 looks a good move but I couldnt use it

[Vador\] the general impression over the last few moves is "hey, buddy, why don't you reinforce your groups, so that I won't be able to attack ANY of them. Then we'll concentrate on my weak ones, and have a lot of fun trying to kill them". See what I mean ? Look back at all your plays in the 20 last moves, you'll see what I mean.]
;W[oj];B[mj];W[nl];B[nm];W[ok];B[pl];W[mm]C[[Vador\] I don't understand. O9 means "defend, or I'll cut you". And you do EVERYTHING (including reinforcing this stone) but protecting the cut ! So, after forgetting for a moment about the cut, your opp can do just nothing interesting but CUT !

So this is the answer to your last question : O10 is BAD ! Don't complain if you lose your east group.

(mind you, I sympathise, having lsot quite a few big groups like this in some of my own games ;-)]
;B[mk];W[lm];B[jk]C[is K9 too far from my wall?

[Vador\] no, it's just not the place to worry about right now.]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[fl];B[gk];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn];W[mh];B[jl]
C[this (K8) looks necessary but again I am not sure

[Vador\] I don't think so. Your stones are quite safe, having several ways to escape.]
;W[pg]C[[Vador\] See what I mean ?];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[pk];B[rn]C[[Vador\] this is premature, I think : first protect the E group, then threaten to link. Now you undanger both groups.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[ro]C[[Vador\] Brrr !];B[rp];W[sn]C[[Vador\] Now (I think) SE corner is UNSAFE, and E group is NOT SAFE yet.]
;B[gc];W[fd]C[[Vador\] "Let's reinforce yourself, please" !]
;B[fb]C[I can see now that this move isnt so big now and I lose sente]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[rr]C[those invades are killing me !BIG PROBLEM!

[Vador\] This is because your groups don't work together. Think about LINKING THEM together towards the center.]
;B[qs];W[rs];B[sq];W[qr];B[ps];W[sr];B[sp]C[[Vador\] DEAD : your opp has an eye, you have not, and the form of the stones is a dead form.]

Thank you very much for your precious time.

[Vador\] Think about making your stones work together. This is the main point in "escaping towards the center". If all your groups are connected, you can't lose.

This is particularly important in the beginning. What move makes the stones work best together ? Don't think of several groups. All the local situations influence the global situation.]
