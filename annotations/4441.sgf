AB[pd][dp]C[hello I'm a french 6 kyu and I will try to comment your game. Please make more questions in your submits in the future.

P];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[np];W[qq]
(;B[oq]C[too heavy, you go back when you have to go on. You risk to lose the corner if white play R2 now (see variation)]
;W[qp];B[qm]C[a bit agressive in my opinion. you let the same for white (white at M3).]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[pm]C[I think my move was bad. i should have played where white played. is that true? but i think the basic idea to attack from that direction was right. do you agree?


white is happy to play here. your group is very unstable. image white playing around R11.

You attack the white group with a week group and a second group which could be attacked.]
;B[qj]
(;W[cn]
(;B[ck]C[you'd better have to enforce the lower side now (you have a weakness here). a pincer will push white to flew away, and to attack you when the timing will be good.]

(;W[cq]C[better to go to the center in my opinion (var)];B[cp]
C[here i expected my opponent to attach from below, which is joseki i think. was my extending move good or should i have attacked right away?

It is joseki too (the same result see var)]
(;W[dq]
(;B[fp]C[error in the joseki. you have to push one more]
(;W[eq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[hr];B[fq]C[useless. you have to go in the big points on the board. white can ignore it.]
;W[fr];B[cf]C[okay, good direction];W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[very gentle. black could do better (var)]
;B[fc];W[ee]
(;B[cc]C[was my approach to the corner right? or should i immediately have played the 3-3 hand?

yes, you can do this, but with D17, white take the upper side easily]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ge];B[ff];W[ef]C[hu?? white have to connect !!!!! never let passing through a tobi or a keima!!!!!!]
;B[fe]TR[ge][ef]C[a keima cut (not funny at all)];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[ed];B[hd];W[fg]C[push a little more (var)]
(;B[he];W[gf];B[hf];W[nf]
(;B[kd];W[jc];B[ne];W[me];B[le];W[md];B[lf];W[mf]C[was this a good extension or would it be better to attack the upper left group more directly?


Bad. you make territory with your wall. you have to push white on it. And why attacking the white group in the upper left? it certainly alive.]

;B[hi];W[gh]C[i think i was quite lucky here that the opponent didnt attack the two lone stones. would it have been a better descision to connect them to the upper group instead of exchanging for the center?

yes i think. less problematic after];B[nm];W[pk]
(;B[jo]C[i tried to form a moyo here. should i have played this stone lower? i didnt dare because i was not sure if it would be possible to connect?]
;W[jp];B[io];W[ip];B[lr]C[to early now]
(;W[ho]C[wrong direction (var)];B[hn];W[ko];B[jm];W[kq];B[hp]
C[i think my last several moves are not aggressive enaugh.

if you play aggressively, you let weaknesses. your about to win, so play firmly, and softly.]

;W[lm];B[ll];W[nl];B[ch]C[i was under time pressure here. though it is a big move, do you think that i was lucky that i didnt get my lower right group killed or is that a living shape?


It is very bad for your group]

yes but you don't play the yose, you respond to your opponent and you don't take sente. you have to ignore your adversaire to take sente with a play bigger.]
