(;B[pq];W[qd];B[cp];W[ec];B[dd]C[Jay: This approach is not too good for B.  W's next move makes this move awekard.]
;W[dc]C[Jay: This makes B D16 like attaching to a 3-4 stone, althoug normally, W would then respond by C16.  But, E17 is not bad.  This leaves B's stone in a bad position. 

The joseki approach include san-san, knight approach, etc.]

(;W[bd]C[Is that I use small or big snow joseki better here?

Jay: This W's move is not proper.  If wants to play here could play B15 (see variation).  Either snow joseki would produce unclear results for both side.  For small scattered-snow, B would end up taking the upper side, without much potential to extend to the right, and W would end up taking the left without potential to extend downward.  But, given the positions of the two stones for each side.  B is lighly favored.  Thus, W should simply connect at C17, or double hane at B15.]

;B[di];W[qo];B[qj];W[ql];B[qg];W[kc];B[od]C[Jay: This will lead to complicated fighting.  I prefer to secure LR first, before starting a fight. Of course, it is a matter of style here. But, because W's UL is solid, starting a fight is unnecessary.]

(;B[rh]C[Jay: Trying to live here only strengthen the two stones at R5, and is not too good for B.  Later, W will attack Q3 stone, or approach LL corner.  This also weakends the UR group as developed in later game.  B should avoid this.  

B could play lightly by bending at K15 in sento, and then jump out at P12, or simply answer W's invasion by Q13.]
