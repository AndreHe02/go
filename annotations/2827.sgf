C[Hello, my name is Kevco and I am playing black. Thank you for your help in advance.

I lost the game on time, but it was in the endgame. I probably would have come up about 5 points short anyways.

I am concerned with my opening and middle game foremost.

Velirun (3d AGA):  I'll do my best  :-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]
;B[np]C[Velirun:  If I were playing, I'd have taken the top left star point for a speedier opening.  In my opinion, this knight's move can be just a tiny bit slow sometimes.]
;W[dd]
(;B[qp]C[I could use any feed back on wether R4 was a good play or not here.

Velirun:  A more proper play would have been a pincer.  You want to constrict the Q5 stone while developing the right and top sides.]

(;W[qo]C[Velirun: Too slow!  He should extend lightly along the side.]
;B[qj]C[In response to white R5 was this an OK pincer or should I have been more aggressive?

Velirun: The normal place is two spaces high.  This pincer allows for a decent extension on the side.]

(;B[cj]MA[jc]C[I almost played black K17 slightly concerned that white might use K17 as an extension and a ladder breaker for a cut at Q10. but I didn't think it had enough value.

If I had chosen K17, would K16 have been better considering the stones on the right?

Velirun: Yes, emphasize the center now - K16.  Extending this direction is probably more important than splitting the side.]
;W[ro];B[nq]C[Velirun: Trading slow moves... but I think your move is good and honest.]
;W[jd]C[Velirun: If I were white, I'd have extended low.];B[cg]
;W[ce];B[fq];W[cl]C[Velirun:  Too far...];B[jp];W[dq];B[fo]
C[Velirun:  Good!  Dual-purpose move.];W[dn];B[fm]C[I don't like my black F7 move, but didn't really know a better one. Probably I should have stregthened the two weak left side stones, but where?

Velirun: Jumping to E13 is a good dual-purpose move.  It aims to get to the center and to invade the top.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[Was O16 appropriate here?

Velirun:  Short answer - I don't think so.  But... thanks to previous missed maneuvers, it is difficult to find a great move.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[me]C[I wish I had played joseki here and played black Q17.]
