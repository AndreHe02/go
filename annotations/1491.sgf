C[Hello - I (Darwi) play white in this game.

Although we both lost fairly large groups i have a feeling that the game was not decided by the fighting but by more strategic points regarding when and how to turn influence into territory.

Thanks in advance for your comments.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]
C[opening seems good.];B[ec];W[dj]C[should have been closer to the shimari?]

(;B[dm]C[this move got a little too extravagent for me maybe something like q 10 would have been nicer.
this move is just asking for a beating. So  you should have attacked the hell out of it]

(;W[cf]C[this is still good but why did black answer the way he did]

(;B[be];W[bf];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[ep];B[eo]C[white is gaining good here but black is weakening the middle left group and white could cut here and take 4 points and kill 4 points]

(;W[bj]C[thought i could leave the corner for now and establish a base there]
;B[ck];W[qf]C[i am not sure which direction is better. in the end black got all the upper side. i think this move started it]
;B[nc];W[rd]C[this move was ok
but you can take this further];B[qc]C[instead of taking the right sed you should attack in my opinion with the movements of s17 black may block is not it dosent matter then black goes s18 then white m17 then black will probably go k17 then white goes q18 then black may go either r 18 or q17 let's go with r18 then p17 black blocks then o18 the rest  you can work out but first off you might just want to extend but that's up to you]

(;W[qj]C[take the right side];B[jc]C[you might have want to attack by going somewhere in blacks territory say h or g 17]

(;W[ee]C[try to get out to the center];B[fe];W[ff];B[ge]C[but black builds a big territory]
;W[gf];B[de];W[df];B[ed];W[ef];B[ce];W[nq]C[try to go for the big points]
;B[pm]C[at this stage black has good top area and is now trying to make more points so he can win so I would say white would be winning now but not for long]
;W[qm];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[op];W[pq]C[now the corner looks good although black is starting a wall]
;B[oq];W[or]
(;B[mq];W[np]C[so i move to the center too];B[oo];W[mo]
(;B[nn];W[mn]C[blacks wall is gone. many cutting points, though, in my position lower right]
;B[fp]C[to lose the corner here was a sad mistake
comment: here I think you should have gone f3 and you would have livedbut you still lose alot of influence on the bottem of the board]

(;W[eq]C[was this already losing it?];B[fq]
(;W[kq]C[should at least have extended to e2 or secure the eye with d2. dont know why i didnt see it then. i really thought i should be able to live in the lower left and could play elsewhere
comment try not to be so protective. comment: many possiblilties at c5 for white]
;B[er]C[i was wrong ...];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[fr]C[you should have cutthat was your only hope to destroy territory]

(;W[ap];B[bo];W[bs];B[ar]C[that was - how much? twenty points?]
;W[nm]C[try to squeeze black];B[pk];W[pj];B[ql];W[nj]C[now i thought maybe i have him - if not captured then at least strong influence to center and right side]
;B[nk];W[ml];B[rm];W[rk];B[rl];W[rn];B[qk];W[rj];B[sn];W[rp]
;B[so];W[sp]C[all this time i was sure i had one more liberty than black]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[oi];W[oj];B[pf]C[how could i have kept this group connected?
comment: see veriation at q13]
(;W[qh]C[somehow i got separated];B[ph];W[pi];B[qe];W[re];B[qg]

(;W[rf];B[rg]C[and the top right is lost];W[oh];B[pg];W[ni]
LB[fl:a][ho:b]C[it seems i cannot turn my advantage into territory. now i think a move at 'a' or 'b' would have been much bigger]
;B[rh];W[qi]C[should just have ignored this move and go for bigger points]
;B[hf];W[mk];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo];W[kn];B[im];W[ik];B[hh];W[fh]
C[better attach?];B[fj];W[ej];B[ek];W[gi]C[try to connect left and right]
;B[gj];W[hi];B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[ki];B[fi];W[ei];B[gh];W[hj]
;B[jk];W[fk]C[that was stupid];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[jj]
(;B[kj]
(;W[kk]
(;B[il];W[jl];B[hk];W[jk];B[jm];W[km];B[kh];W[li];B[lh];W[he]
;B[hg]C[i was hoping he'd atari at h16];W[ie]C[but even so i try to surround his group]
;B[je];W[jh]C[i was sure this plan to capture the h12  group would work.]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf];B[kf]C[unfortunately it also builds black's territory]
;W[if]C[now it is 3 liberties vs. 2];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[fd]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[fc]C[i think at this point we have more or less reached the final position - except for the lower side i do not see big points]
;W[ng]C[try to reduce. too small? but i thought the keima at o14 could too easily be cut off]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[mf];W[bk];B[dk];W[cj];B[bl];W[dl]C[not much chance for success]
;B[cl];W[iq]C[k3 better?];B[jq];W[jr];B[hp];W[hr];B[hq];W[ke]

;B[in];W[al];B[am];W[bm]C[a 9 definitely better but i thought just maybe i can connect the dead b3 group]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[al];W[rc]C[could this group have been saved?]
;B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe]C[i dont know why we fought this ko. in the beginning (this move) i thought that together with o15 i had a nice hole into his territory]
;B[ro];W[qp];B[qe];W[el];B[fm];W[ne];B[me];W[pe]C[dont know why he didnt just take with o16]

;B[ri];W[ae];B[ad];W[af];B[sj];W[sk];B[lp];W[lq]C[sorry I if I couldn't help you very much 
reicat 8kyu];C[this is it. even though most everything (except losing the lower left corner) went according to plan, i lost, but how? lower half of the board seems about equal: left side black , right side white. must be the top which i could (did) not get into

I would very much appreciate your telling me where i made the crucial mistakes that led to this result.

thank you


I can't really comment you game it was good just a couple of mistakes that if you didn't make you would have won sorry I could be of much help]
