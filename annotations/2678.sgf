Final score
BLACK 162
WHITE 194

Lingering questions:
- where were my mistakes? (I've caught a few of them, mentioned in the comments - anything else I've missed?)
- where were my good plays?  (I consider the trapping of the h17 group, the k14 group, and defense and slight expansion of the b10 group good plays - but perhaps they were at the expense of something else?)
- how could I have got another 32 points or so? (:  In particularly, what could I have done to reduce the huge white territory on the bottom?
- was there anyway to reduce or kill the bottom left to top left groups?

Hi,

   I'll review the game based on per move, and answer questions or comments as I see them.   If my English is a bit bad I am sorry.  But I'll try to give verations for what I am saying as to give you an idea why a move should be or should not be played.   My comments will be marked by "*:"

;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[*: This move is too soft, you should perince O3, or it will be too each for white to develop below and maybe make the entire bottom his. Also Q6 doesn't help you as much as you might think, there is still aji at R5, R3, and even checking extention at R8.  So you have lots to defend, the perince will make the game hard for you, but if you don't it will make the game too easy for your oppenet.]
;W[df]C[*: Seems like you guys have a copycat go going on, well either way, white is making the same mistake, it would become easy for black to get the top his if he fellowed up with a move around J17.]
;B[id]C[I wouldn't recommend this move because it creates bad aji for white to attack you.  So instead of this move consider K17.]

(;W[kp]
(;B[pj]C[Not really idea, you are asking white to make his moyo big, this is too nice. Please look at some of other suggested moves.]
;W[jj];B[dk]C[Good idea, but wrong line, if you are going to go deep to invade, you have to think about life, before anything else.  If you try to run the move at K10 is there to hinder you, so better to play C9 and expand eithr way to make a SOLID base in white's space and then reduce him from with in.]
;W[dm];B[dh]C[Even thou you how have two space apart stones its still not a base, white can hurt u you and make you heavey while helping himself]
;W[eo];B[fh];W[eb];B[fb];W[ec];B[fe]C[No, don't play moves like this you are giving white some threats to use later on might it be F16 ush or a peek at G16 it could come back to hant you.]

Lessons to be learned from this game ....

1) Don't be too scared ><  You let have white what he wanted without fighting for it.  

2) Always keep your eyes open for tesuji like G8 to help you out.

3) Don't let white come into your moyo and make easy life like at Q13, make him work for it.

4) When an approch is made, look at the options of perince vs, extention, if whtie is apprching from his own corner most of the times it's bad idea to extend, you should perice, unless you have some other plan (aka you need sente or something)

5) Life and death problems, your bottom left was ALMOST alive, if you saw that move, so work on life and death problems on gobase.org, http://gobase.org/studying/problems/academy/ these are Korean go problems, do set 1 again and again, until you can get all right.  I do that at least onces a week.  And i still get about 10 problems wrong.  Just comes to show you how IMPORTANT it is to keep doing these life and death problems.  That would also have helped you attack white's bottom. :D  Well best of luck, if you want to ask questions email me or tag me down on KGS :P Tata ^_^]
