AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[samtregar: Hello.  My name is Sam Tregar and I'll be reviewing your game.  I play on KGS as samtregar at 12k and at the New York Go Center at 5k.   Please feel free to contact me by email (sam@tregar.com) or on KGS if you have any questions about my review.   I've commented moves that I think are particularly good or bad.  At the end of the game I try to sumarize the biggest issues of the game for both sides.

samtregar: As a general note, in a high handicap game like this black starts with just one thing: influence.  All your stones are on the fourth line (except for the one in the middle at tengen), and that means that these stones are for fighting.  If they were one line lower, on the third line, they might be useful for making territory.  This means that when you play black with a handicap you must be looking for ways to attack your opponent in order to make territory.  I think you know this because you do a lot of attacking.  However, when you attack your goal isn't usually to kill.  Instead you must look for ways to use your attack to form solid territory.  I'll try to point out ways you could have done that in this game.]
;W[nq]LB[pn:A][lq:B]C[samtregar: This move aims to attack your corner, or possibly make some territory on the lower side.  The usual response is at A.  I played B recently and my opponent (8d) told me later it was a terrible move.  So don't do that.  ;)]
;B[np]C[samtregar: This is not a good move.  When you want to attack a stone it is rarely good to attach to the stone.  It feels like a strong move but actually all it does is make your opponent reinforce the stone and get stronger.]
;W[mp];B[no]LB[op:A]C[samtregar: I think A would be more stronger here.  It would form a wall facing up that would be more useful than this shape.]
;W[pr]LB[oq:A]C[samtregar: this feels like an overplay to me.  There's a big weakness left around A.]
;B[oq]C[samtregar: good.];W[or];B[pq]LB[mq:A]C[samtregar: I think I would have played the cut at A now.  Your move doesn't put any presure on white.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[rq];B[rp];W[mo]LB[mq:A]C[samtregar: A still looks good.  Splitting your opponents groups is usually a good idea.  See the variation for how I would expect it to go.]

(;B[mn];W[nn];B[mq];W[nr];B[on]LB[lq:A]C[samtregar: I think you need to follow up the cut by extending to A.  Otherwise white can play there and capture your cutting stone.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[om]LB[pn:B][oo:A]C[samtregar: I guess you know now that you needed to do something about the double atari here.  Playing at A or B would be good.  I think B is better.]
;B[lp];W[oo];B[lo]C[samtregar: good choice.  His groups are separated now.]
;W[pn];B[op]LB[po:A]C[samtregar: very defensive move.  I don't think it was really needed.   A is better if you want to defend against the cut.]
;W[ql];B[nl]LB[pg:B][qj:A]TR[pj]C[samtregar: I don't understand this move.  I would prefer to reinforce the marked stone with a move at A or B.  The move you played doesn't put any presure on white and it doesn't help you make territory.]
;W[pk];B[ok]LB[oj:A][qj:B]C[samtregar: A would be more solid.  B is also possible.]
;W[nk];B[pl]LB[nj:A][oj:B]C[samtregar: very bad move.  I think you try to give atari too much.  In this case you're just asking for trouble.  I would prefer a move at A or B.]
;W[qk];B[mk]LB[ol:A]TR[pl]C[samtregar: now you must connect at A.  Why did you play the marked stone if you didn't want it to live?]
;W[ol];B[nj];W[fp];B[fo]LB[cn:B][dn:A][dq:D][eq:C]C[samtregar: Just like before, the attachment isn't a good attack.  A move at A or B is good here, I think.  C or D are also possible.]
;W[go];B[fm];W[eq];B[ep];W[gq]C[samtregar: look what a nice shape white just built!  You made him build this shape, which is why your attack wasn't a good one.  Moves that force your opponent to do things he wants to do anyway are called "thank you" moves.  White should be thanking you now!]
;B[dq];W[fn];B[eo];W[gm];B[en];W[fl];B[gn];W[hn];B[el];W[fn]
;B[em]C[samtregar: I like this sequence for black.  You've built a big wall and secured quite a bit of territory.  In exchange white is alive between your two groups, but he had that before anyway.]
;W[cf];B[eg]LB[fc:D][fd:A][ce:C][ch:B]C[samtregar: I think this is the worst move of the game.  It serves absolutely no purpose that I can see.  It's too far from the corner to be a response to the invading stone.  It's too far from the stone at D10 to be an extension.  It's just sitting out in the middle, all alone, doing nothing.  Instead, a move at A would be fine.  B might also work, but it looks a lot like the move I mentioned earlier that earned me abuse from an 8d.  C and D are also possiblities.]
;W[ci]C[samtregar: white is trying to make a base.];B[dh]C[samtregar: good forcing move.]
;W[ch];B[di];W[bk];B[cj]LB[cl:A][bm:B]C[samtregar: No! You must limit white's invasion into your territory on the lower left.  Maybe A or B, but the last thing you want to do is let him ruin your largest area!]
;W[bj];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[gj]LB[gh:A][hi:B]C[samtregar: white is trying to nullify the wall you just built.  To stop him, a play around A or B should work.]
;B[fk]C[samtregar: why play atari here?  Is it to try to cut the white line?]
;W[gk];B[gl];W[hl]LB[hk:A]C[samtregar: if you want to try to cut, you must play A next and fight the Ko.]
;B[gn];W[hm];B[gi]C[samtregar: again, attachment is not a good way to attack.  This just asks white to get stronger.]
;W[fj];B[ek];W[fi];B[gg];W[hi];B[gh];W[ji]LB[fc:B][cd:A][qj:C]
TR[jj]C[samtregar: ignore this move, it's no threat to you.  Even if you lost the marked stone you don't need it.  A play at A or B would be big now, I think.  C looks right too.]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[kh];W[jf];B[kf];W[ke];B[kg];W[je]LB[hc:B][id:A]
C[samtregar: White is aiming for the top.  You should play at A to stop him.  Or possibly B.]
;B[jg];W[hh];B[hg];W[id]C[samtregar: big move.];B[jc]LB[kd:A]
C[samtregar: I would prefer A.];W[hc];B[ib]C[samtregar: Wasted move.  This does not threaten white and it doesn't make any territory for you.]
;W[ec]C[samtregar: this was a great sequence for white.  He managed to steal a big chunk of territory that could have been yours.  Notice how your stones on the fourth line didn't allow you to defend against the attack all alone.  They are too high to be defensive positions.]
;B[fb]C[samtregar: I don't like this move.  I don't think it gains you much and it forces white to become stronger.]
;W[fc];B[ic];W[he];B[hb];W[eb];B[gc];W[gd];B[hd];W[ie];B[ld]
LB[md:A]C[samtregar: good move.  It could be one line further, at A, but this is very strong.]
;W[le];B[nd]LB[qc:A]C[samtregar: feels a little too slow, but you are making good use of your thickness here to secure territory.  Note though, that white can still come in at A.]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[ne];B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[kd];B[kc];W[qc];B[re]
C[samtregar: ouch.  This doesn't attack the white stone.  Instead you just gave away a good sized piece of what you just made.  (or you should have.  Later white makes mistakes and loses the corner)]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[nb]LB[rc:A]C[samtregar: This should have been at A.  There's no reason white should give up the corner here.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[rc];W[rb];B[sb];W[qb]LB[qa:A]C[samtregar: would A have saved white?  I'm not sure, but I think so.  At best I see that black can get Ko after that.]
;B[pa]C[samtregar: good play];W[ra]LB[lb:A]C[samtregar: terrible.  White might have tried to live with a play around A.  I don't think it would work, but this certainly won't!]
;B[mb];W[nc];B[od];W[mc];B[lb];W[lc];B[kb];W[ig];B[ii];W[ih]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[ea];W[of];B[oe]LB[lf:A]C[samtregar: A would have been more severe..  White might be dreaming of killing here, but you don't need to worry.]
;W[nf];B[sc]C[samtregar: huh?  White should have thanked you for the free point.]
;W[qg];B[sa]LB[pf:A]C[samtregar: again, what's going on here?  A play at leaves you obviously alive.]
;W[qi];B[rg];W[rh];B[rf];W[er];B[dr];W[bn]TR[cj]C[samtregar: ouch.  This is what you should have prevented back when you played the marked stone.  This is a huge move.]
;B[br]LB[co:A]C[samtregar: this is very weak response.  You're giving white all your territory for free.  A would be better.]
;W[bp]C[samtregar: Now the game enters endgame.  I don't have much to say about the endgame here, but I will include some notes at the end of the game.]

samtregar: no, these two groups are definitely alive.  I don't think they were ever in any serious danger.  Certainly by this point they are securely connected to the bottom group which has numerous eyes.]

[ll][dm][lm][ln][ko][mo][kp][mp][ar][as][bs]C[samtregar: White played a good game here, in my opinion.  He made a few mistakes, the biggest of which was dying in the upper right when he should have lived.  If he hadn't made that mistake he would have won.  Playing white against 9 stones is very hard, even if the handicap is appropriate for the player's strengths.

samtregar: Black on the other hand made many questionable plays, particularly in response to white's invasions.  Attachment moves proved ineffective at stopping white's advance.  Black's biggest mistake though was allowing all his lower left territory to be taken away.  If black had properly protected that territory white wouldn't have come close to winning.  Similarly, black lost a chance to make territory on the top left when white was allowed to invade.

samtregar: Thank you for allowing me to review your game!])
