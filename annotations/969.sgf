RE[B+R]

C[I played this game on www.itsyourturn.com, a sort of play-by-mail web go server. My opponent is a 2-dan member of the club I go to, but because of the format of the web server, I ended up playing white.

I would appreciate any and all comments about the game, strategic, tactical, or whatever.

My opponent said that it was a close game, with "no terrible mistakes" although he thought he should have played more agressively. (!)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[po]LB[qn:a][pn:b][qo:c]C[Is this the right kakari to play?

JL: This is fine. You can also try [a\] and [b\] in your games. Low kakari of [c\] is bad as black has excellent R9 as answer.]
;B[qo]C[Is this the right joseki to play for black? Or is it too passive? I was worried about the hasami.

JL: It is usual to play a hasami with the thickness in top left, but black can play this way as well.]
;W[qn]LB[pp:a]C[Another option would have been [a\], but that would easily lead to complications.]
;B[qp];W[pm];B[nq]LB[op:a]C[Black kosumi of [a\] would have been a bit more active than this slightly passive move.]
;W[qi];B[cj]LB[qf:a]C[As black I would have approached the white group on the other side of the board. Now white extendion of [a\] would be very large and solid.]
;W[jc]SL[oc][nq]LB[cg:a][cm:b][ql:c][qf:d]N[Wrong direction]
C[JL: As the marked black stones as both low, there is little hurry in these directions. Also as [a\] and [b\] are miai, there is no real reason to play either direction yet.

However there is a weakness in white shape at [c\], and it is this weakness that makes the solid two space extension of [d\] so big. Also it reduces the influence of the solid black corner group.

I would even go to so far as to say that [d\] is the only move for white in this position.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[fq]SL[nq]LB[bd:a][cc:b][dh:c]C[This is wrong direction for black. Black should simpy play [a-b-c\]-sequence as the two black stones should now become thin. Also notice how the marked stone is low making this side of the board rather small in scale.]
;W[cn]C[Good.];B[dr];W[cq];B[hp]
(;W[qf]LB[jp:a][jq:b][mp:c][ch:d][mc:e][bd:f]C[Should I have invaded instead? If so, where?

JL: For invasion or redusion the points from [a\] to [c\]  are most usual.

I think you played a possible move - however black can make a lot of territory enclosing the bottom. If he does that, white should probably immediately invade at [d\] and aim at playing [e\].

Other possible moves are [f\], however as white top is still open, it is not that attractive, and [e\], almost forcing an answer.

Still, I myself would probably have played something like the variation of the previous node.]
;B[kp]SL[cf][cj]LB[ql:a][cc:b][hc:c]C[The bottom is huge and white territorial frameworks are still open at [a\] to [c\].

White must however take advantage of the thinness of the two black stones and attack.]
;W[mc]C[Quite big, but now black can stabilize his only weak group on the left side. If white plays this move he needs to have a special plan because of this.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[dh]
(;W[je]SL[oc][qd]N[Bad move]C[This move is very slow. Instead white should put pressure on the two marked stones - see variaton of previuous node.]
;B[cr]LB[oe:a]C[More important to play [a\] now. Important moves before big ones.]
;W[cl]LB[pc:a]C[This is too slow and small. White can not really make any territory here, so ignoring the black move would have been natural as life is not in danger. Also this move has absolutely no other meaning that securing the life of a group that needs no securing of life.

Harassaing the two top right black stones would be correct. Actually now white [a\] looks promising as after that black has no eyes in the corner.]
;B[bc]LB[oe:a]C[Again the wrong direction of play. [a\] would have been proper.]
;W[ne]SL[qd][oc]N[Wrong spot]C[Black [a\] gives him a very strong shape. Also white should have attacked the two marked stones instead of forcing them to live a comfortable life. It also looks like black is going to get sente here, so the white moyo will be vastly reduced.]
;B[nb]N[Mistake in direction]C[Now white can (and should) play the variation. Black is too preoccupiend with territory - the center is now important; compared to moves in the center this move is rather small yose move. And very gote.]

(;W[rd]LB[pd:a][mn:b]C[An overplay, I think

JL: well, really the wrong tsuke. The center moyo is what counts now, not some small corner points. First [a\] instead of the played move, then [b\].]
;B[re]LB[qe:a]C[[a\] might have been better to allow black an acces to the center.]
;W[qe]C[The original play was to invade the corner, but afterwards I thought it was better to stay on the outside.

JL: First you should have attacked the corner severely earlier on, now the outside is the only chance you have.]
;B[rc];W[mb]LB[pd:a][qc:b][mn:c][nm:d]N[Small]C[Also there is nothing wrong to play [a\] first as black must answer at [b\].

Move played prevents a monkey jump - that is about 8 points. Is an 8 point gote move in order now? Moves like white [c\] or black [d\] are central points of influence in the center with far higher value: usually the moves that not only enlarge your territory to limit opponents are inferior to those which do both at the same time.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[ma]LB[la:a][na:b][mn:c]C[Too early? Endgame? Should I tenuki and find a bigger play elsewhere?

JL: small. I would play from [a\] to [c\], however if [c\] is not enough to win the game then I would play it one line further to the left.]
;W[la];B[na];W[kb]C[Small. Black could only make little damage here.]
;B[mj]C[I didn't know how to respond to this.

JL: Black played in rather deeply - you can not defend as black will then win. Either you should attack this stone directly or indirectly. I would probably play like in the variation.]

(;W[mn]LB[jp:a]C[At this time, I think this move lacks in severity. Although, it may make it possible for white to play at [a\] now at some point.]
;B[ko]LB[ql:a]N[Odd move]C[I would have just escaped with the lone stone. What one needs to notice now is the slight thinness of white stones. Black [a\] may help black in the future in some way.]
;W[ni]LB[ml:a][lk:b]C[What is the purpouse of this move? No reason to play close to thickness no matter to whom it belongs to. [a\] looks nice, making white stronger and chasing black. Also kata-tsuki of [b\] seems ok. White must take agressive stand now.]
;B[mi];W[ef]LB[ql:a]C[Rather novel change of direction. Also this is not too good move. It does not have any effect of the black group next to it, and now black can make shape to his weak group and aim at invasion of [a\].

White made things hard for himself by playing the marked stone - attacking the two stones is now much harder.]
;B[bk]C[Black has decided that the center black stones are alive and moves way too far ahead in territory.]
;W[bl]C[It is painful to play this submissively.];B[br];W[bq]
C[...and again. Instead of being concerned with making eyes with territory white should have played more lightly here early on, forgetting all about territory here.]
;B[ro];W[jg]SL[mi][mj]TR[mn][pm][qn][po]LB[ql:a]C[Again white is making slow moves from thickness. No good - you should have been driving the marked stones against your thickness, not away from it.

Also black [a\] will soon be very severe as the triangulated stones are weak.]
;B[qk]C[this looks like an overplay.];W[pk];B[pj]C[Unreasonable?

JL: Black tries too much here, and too early.];W[qj];B[nj];W[ql]
SL[nj][mj][mi]N[Wrong.]C[you should be attacing the three marker stones, this move helps the critical black stones the most.]
;B[rk];W[rl]SL[nj][mj][mi]LB[oj:a]C[JL: Is this move needed? Perhaps better to play [a\]. Side side is small anyhow, so the aim should be at the marked stones.]
;B[ok];W[pl];B[nn]C[Black should play more relaxed now. The game is over.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[no];B[ln];W[mo];B[mp];W[lm]C[Finally white attacks, but this is way too little way too late.]
;B[ll];W[km];B[kl];W[jm];B[ik];W[hm];B[gk];W[fm];B[ek];W[ck]
;B[em];W[en];B[dk];W[dm]LB[bj:a]C[I don't think I should have ataried this way. I forgot why I did, though. I thought I read out a bad cut somewhere...

JL: in this case this atari may be a good move as it makes eyeshape. Black [a\] looks gote now.]
;B[el]C[Bad move - white should try to find an indirect way of protecting the cut in sente.]
;W[fn]SL[lm][km][jm][hm][fm]C[Solid but slow. None of the marked white stones is important - they only have point value, no other value, so playing more creatively here would have been ideal.]
;B[bb]N[Huge];W[fh]C[I should have answered instead, I think

JL: yes. the topleft corner is "double territory" - both sides win/lose each move.]
;B[db];W[dj]LB[bj:a]C[White tries to attack a living group with this aji-keshi - for example white [a\] may become less severe.]
;B[ej]LB[ci:a]C[Blunder - simple nobi fo [a\] is better. Big groups never die.]
;W[di]C[Very bad.];B[ei]C[White gets a birthday present.];W[ci]
;B[ch];W[bi];B[eh];W[jk]C[Oops, one line lower];B[jl];W[il]
C[The score, the way I see it:

B 50 bottom, 15 upper right, 15 upper left

W 20 left, 10 right, 5.5 komi, and the moyo

I think I need 45 points out of my moyo.



JL:

Black:

White: left = about 15, right = about 12, 15 to 20 upperleft + komi.

Black: about 58.

White is about or over 10 points behind with no realistic way of catching up.]
;B[ij];W[pd]C[Endgame to firm up my moyo

JL: I would not call that a moyo, but "badly flattened something that gives me only very little territory".]
;B[qc];W[nc];B[pb];W[cb];B[ca];W[kh]TR[jk]C[This was to start closing off my moyo, as well as threaten to rescue the marked stone.]
;B[kj];W[fb];B[dc]C[Wrong direction - white will not be in a hurry to play here, so neighter should black.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[ed];B[fc];W[gc];B[hg];W[ji];B[jj];W[hh];B[gb]
;W[gd]C[You can not afford to give up territory like this. The cut of g16 was not dangerous as you cant make anything in the center anyhow.]
;B[hb];W[hc]LB[gh:a][mh:b]C[The score, the way I see it:

B bottom 50, upper left 18, upper right 14, center 5
W left 20, 10 right, 12 upper left, up to 20 right framework, 5 komi

I'm down by 20 points.


JL: and this is yet another slow move. It is better to for example play [a\] or some other such move, or [b\].]
;B[mg]C[I resigned.   Was I right to resign? I didn't think I could salvage much out of the middle, and I didn't see any invasion points (or 20 points of keshi) in the bottom territory. The monkey jump on the left would be countered by the one on the right (or blocking on the right would result in blocking on the left.)


JL: Well, after the move 48 the game was pretty much lost, so after that any time was good for resignation :)


There were two major issues:

1. Direction of play
  - Study this - a move played in the wrong direction is often totally or almost wasted.
  - Study what is thick and what is thin, and try to play away from thickness.
  - One idea about thickness: if one group becomes stronger, all the other groups become stronger as well, while the enemy groups become weaker - the relative positions of the groups shall then decide where to play.


2. Endgame and counting score
  - You play small endgame too early
  - Constantly count the score during the game - otherwise you will have little clue of the proper direction of play.


For a 12 kyu your game was very good.])

(;W[oe]C[This would force black to protect the corner - ignoring this move would practically kill the corner, yet no good answers excist. I have no clue what the proper way for playing for black would be.

The key would no be which player would manage to play a moyo enlarging/reducing move in the bottom right corner.]
