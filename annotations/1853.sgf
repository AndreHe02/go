k and I, I'm between 17-23 k I guess, may be u can tell me my level...

I'm black and Hal is white

I would like some comment, please

Especially on my yose which is very bad.
And how could i reduce W territory on the south

----

Overall, your problem was not in your yose, it was in your middle game which makes your yose difficult.

You will need to learn how to keep your stones connected, and also, make sure you don't leave so many cutting points behind.

Your reviewer.];W[nq];B[pn];W[no]
(;B[nm]LB[pr:A]C[If you want to prevent white from taking the corner, consider playing at A. See variation.]
;W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[don't let W live easily and take the corner.

Is it the best move?

---

It is a good move.  Very standard.  Prevents white from playing from the same spot. See variation.]
;W[ln];B[jn]LB[kr:A]C[don't let W escape

---

Well, K6 is ok, but not because of preventing escaping. It is good because it keeps pressure on white and starts building a moyo.

White can easily live now by playing A at any time, so W is not really very worried anymore.]
;W[ll]
(;B[lj]LB[jl:B][lq:A]TR[dj][jj][jn][dp][jp]C[again, but i feel that's not good

Maybe k8 or n10 better

---

Problem with M10 is that it does not really do anything, it just pushes white into your moyo.  With K6 you build your moyo, with M10 you break it again.  M10 does not even threaten to kill the white stones.  It would be better to play at A.

Your marked stones make a moyo. It would be better to reinforce it with B.

See variations.];W[kk]C[HAL9000 [16k?\]: Yes :)]
(;B[jk]C[Wrong direction. You should connect.

White will ooze out of your walls anyway; but you are able to choose which way he must go.  Now you're trying to block both ways, and that is simply not possible.

Blocking from this way means that you will be getting cutting points later on, and since white is a better player, he can probably make them work better for him than for you.]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[ji];B[lk];W[kl];B[li]C[Good move, otherwise B in trouble.]
;W[jl]
(;B[il]C[not good.
k12 better?

----

Yes, far better. But you will lose your lone two stones anyway, and the bottom two stones start to look lonely.  See variation.]

he top right area.

Is p8 better?

---

Well, since the top right is still open for attacks at A, B, C, D, E, F and so on, it is not yet solid area.  It is better to protect what you have on the right.

See variation.];W[ol];B[pl]C[See?  You played Q8 anyway =).]
;W[om]C[Mistake by white, B should connect at Q7 and be very, very happy.

White is playing very small moves here.]
(;B[on]C[Huge mistake.  This allows white to basically damage black area to the right. Simply protecting at Q7 works far better.]
;W[ok];B[oj]C[Another mistake, though consistent with your idea of protecting the top. However, your nearly secure area which you created with R3, Q4, Q6 is now gone.]
;W[nn]C[It is a good thing that white makes a mistake here. Now b should absolutely connect at Q7.]

(;B[nj]C[HAL9000 [16k?\]: Making them look pretty.

There is no point in protecting against this cut.  See variation.]

I showed it earlier.];W[rl];B[rm]C[It looks like B gets two moves here because of undo; I am not certain what is happening.

At any rate, S7 is a mistake =)]

Yes, B now has to try and live. The R10 cut looks dangerous to black, it is possible he has to sacrifice a lot of stones.]

It's okay. You would lose a few points (likely the G11 stones) if white cut, but since W played at F15 he now has to live in this area.]

E15 connect and the whole B live, is taht correct?

Yes.E14 is better, though - it leaves less useful forcing moves for W.

But at any case, remember the old saying "CONNECT THE BLOODY STONES!"  Tattoo this to your eyelids and remember it every time you play.  If in doubt, connect your stones. This is what my teacher always tells me :-)]
