C[Dear Reviewer, thankyou in advance for completing this review, I am very grateful. I hope the comments I have left are clear, just e-mail me iif there are any problems.

The major mistake I feel I made in this game was allowing one of my groups to become very weak. White attcked this group and as a result made a lot of territory on the left and lower left side. Your comments on any area of the game would be greatly appreciated - Terence

[cf][de]C[I felt this was the best direction to approach, works well with D17. Lota of options here though

PC: This looks good. The other option I'd consider would be a shimari at one of the marked points.]
;W[fp];B[ci];W[cp];B[oq]C[I like my position here a lot more than whites.

PC: White's previous move was a little slow, so I think you're slightly ahead here.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[pn]TR[op][pq]LB[ql:A]C[3rd line better for white?

PC: Not significantly. White's mistake was to play the marked exchange; a pincer would have been a better option.]
;B[kq];W[iq];B[ko];W[io];B[ql]C[Is a move on the top better here? I wanted to approach this group straight away because of Q6

PC: This is fine: it's big, and threatens to cut White into two groups.]
;W[nn]
(;B[pp]LB[qo:A]C[PC: Usual here is 'a'. In the game your move ends up giving the same result but gives White the option of playing 'a', sacrificing a stone to stay connected. See variation.]

;W[ps];B[no];W[om]
(;B[on]LB[mn:A]C[PC: This is too optimistic, expecting White to respond with a bad move. Playing 'a' is better, after which the throw-in is more of a threat.(See variation)]
;W[pm];B[mn];W[oo];B[mp]LB[np:A]C[PC: Probably better at 'a', avoiding some of the shortage of liberty problems.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[ln];B[mo]C[I allowed my group here become heavy and and tried to play larger moves, this was a mistake I think.]
;W[nm];B[lm];W[ml]
(;B[pj]LB[km:A]C[PC: Probably better to complete the capture of the marked stone with 'a'. That leaves White with the problem of what to do about the centre group, which still needs another move for two definite eyes.]
;W[kn];B[oc];W[mr];B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[ns];B[lr]C[PC: Good, no point answering the atari.]

;B[hm]
(;W[ik]LB[dm:A]C[PC: Not necessary. White could start a leaning attack with 'a' here - see variation.]
;B[fm];W[jc]
(;B[de];W[cg]LB[ce:B][eg:C][ei:A]C[How to deal with this? I wanted something like A but that seemed to give up too much of my top left corner.

PC: If you want to defend the corner then just play 'b'. If White jumps out to 'c' you can answer with 'a', strengthening the lower left (which is your main weakness) and leaving White with a couple of weak stones plus the single stone at K17 to worry aobut.]
;B[dg];W[ch]
(;B[cf]TR[ch][dg]LB[dh:A][di:B][ei:C]C[PC: Usually when you start with the marked Black stone you're aiming to connect up by continuing with 'a'. If you wanted to play C14 it would have been better to do so without the exchange of the marked stones - if White had answered with C12 you could have played 'b' rather than D13, while if White had answered with D13 you could have attacked with 'c'.

See the variation for the usual move at 'a' - that seems to work out pretty well for you here.]
;W[dh];B[cl]SQ[ci]TR[cn][fm]LB[ck:A]C[tried to make shape

PC: Your main problem in this area is that the C11 stone is weak because it's lost a liberty; your move doesn't really help with that. Playing a little closer with 'a' would help.]
;W[cj]
(;B[di]LB[bi:A]C[Wrong move? what do you suggest?

PC: 'a' is the other option - see the variation.];W[bi];B[dj]
;W[ck];B[dk]
(;W[bk]
(;B[qh]LB[gc:B][lc:A][nj:C]C[PC: This is rather unambitious,, so you only want to play this way if you've calculated that it's enought to win. White's territory is about 50 points (including komi); you can expect about 12 in the top left, 5 from the lower left and maybe 30 from the right, leaving the game very close but probably in White's favour. I'd want to play on a larger scale, e.g. Black 'a', White 'b', Black 'c' to build a substantial moyo on the right.]
;W[eg];B[df];W[ei];B[hc];W[mc]
(;B[oe]TR[qh]LB[dl:A]C[PC: This makes the marked stone look even more over-concentrated. Protecting the cut at 'a' is pretty big.]

(;W[bl]LB[dl:A]C[PC: White can just cut at 'a' - see variation.]

(;B[qb]TR[kc][kd][ld]LB[ib:A]C[PC: I think you get a better result by saving your stone with 'a'. White takes the corner, but you end up with more territory in the top left and your central influence is stronger because the marked stones have the option of capturing the lone White stone.]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[pc];B[pd];W[qc];B[rc];W[pa];B[ni]LB[jd:C][qa:A]
[rb:B]C[PC: It's worth playing 'a' first, as if White gets to play 'b' then you'll lose this move. 'c' is another forcing move you should get in first.]
;W[hj];B[kr];W[ir];B[fo];W[eo];B[go];W[en];B[gp];W[fq];B[gq]
;W[gr];B[fn];W[ej];B[li]C[White allowed me to take a lot of territory which I unfortunately lost by a simple mistake.

PC: At this stage White has: 32 pts bottom left, maybe 5 bottom right, 10 centre, 8 top, 6 komi = 61, plus sente. You have:
20 top left, 6 bottom left, 36 right & centre = 62. You do have reasonable chance to expand the top left and the centre, so this looks OK.]
;W[nk]LB[cm:D][jd:B][jg:A][rb:C]C[PC: This is small. Any of 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' would be bigger.]
;B[jd]C[PC: Good.];W[ja];B[kj];W[kk];B[ih];W[cm];B[fk];W[ek]
;B[el];W[gk];B[fl];W[gl];B[gm]LB[nr:A]C[PC: Taking the ko with 'a' is better; you'll at least force White to use up a ko threat.]

;W[jg];B[jh];W[jf]
(;B[kh]LB[id:A][ji:B]C[PC: Good shape, but unfortunately leading to trouble. If you play 'a' and White answers at L12, the strange-looking move at 'b' appears to work - see variation.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[id];B[je]LB[hd:B][lf:A]C[PC: Oops! Even if you defend at 'a' here, you still have the problem of White pushing through at 'b'.
