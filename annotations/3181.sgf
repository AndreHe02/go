C[Hikertrash [21k\]: Hi ... have fun

Erithid: I hope that I can help! Thank you for letting me review your game. I put some variations in when I thought they would be useful.]
;B[qd];W[dp]C[VincePL [21k\]: hi have a nice game];B[pq];W[cd]
C[Something about this move bothers me. I dont think it works well with the stone at R16. I think it would have been better placed at hoshi, or personally I would have attacked at q5, and then tried to end in sente and take d16. I think even d17 is better here than c16.]
;B[oc]
(;W[pj]LB[pj:A][qo:B]C[Erithid: I dont like this move. I understand why you did it, but I think its trying to do too much. I think that r5 would have been better

See variation]
(;B[qh]LB[qh:A][qo:B];W[ph]C[This move is "pushing from behind."  You dont really get much from this exchange and black secures real territory. I think r5 would still be a better move here.]
;B[pg];W[qi];B[rh];W[ri];B[si];W[sj];B[sh];W[rk];B[ec];W[jd]
;B[oh];W[qo];B[jq];W[qq]C[same here, you are pusing the q stone from behind and because of that are at a disadantage. You end up over concentrated. There are still much bigger moves on the board like c10, g17 would be fun, n17 maybe.]
;B[qr];W[pp];B[rq];W[qp];B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[gd];B[ee];W[cf]
;B[eg];W[ch];B[dj]C[Black is over playing here i think. If you can seperate his e13 stones from his d10 and attack either, you would be at an advantage.]

(;W[cj]LB[dh:B][cj:A]C[watch the conatct plays, they are not as strong as you would think they would be]
;B[ck];W[bj]C[Move 38
I'm wondering if my fuseki strategy is the root of my problem. I seem to create many living groups, yet lose by 10-20 points.

you do create living groups, but you play too tight. I think that if you played lighter you wouldnt run into a lot of the problems you do.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei]C[this cannot work :-(];B[fi];W[ej]
;B[ek];W[ci];B[fj];W[nj]C[I think that m17 might have been bigger here or h3 even]
;B[pi];W[qk];B[oj];W[ok];B[oi];W[nl];B[nn];W[on];B[nm];W[om]
;B[mo];W[mm];B[mn];W[ll];B[lm];W[ml];B[jn];W[fq]C[This invited the invasion, may have been better to attack UR and then if you end in sente grab c3. The downside to a 3,3 invasion is that the oponent gets influence, but the dominance of black at e9 and k6 pretty much nullifies that, even though you wont get much in the corner, it would prolly be best to get something if you can, but i think not this way.]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[VincePL [21k\]: you have good fuseki];B[bp];W[co]
;B[bo];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[fr];B[cn]C[I think you need to be looking at the UR still, even a big move like n15 might be possible.You are quibbling over crumbs here.]
;W[bk];B[cl];W[bm];B[bn];W[cm];B[dm];W[dn];B[bl];W[em];B[dl]
;W[en];B[me];W[mc];B[nb];W[le]C[again, the attachment move is not what you want here you end up way over concentrated. i wonder if o16 would work here, m16 would be safe and a little lighter i think too]
;B[md];W[ld];B[nc];W[lb];B[mb];W[lc]C[Move 100

The Middle game always confuses me. I have trouble prioritizing which extensions are more important.

Also I tend to approach too closely to thickness and end up losing stones in an attempt to erase the power of opposing thickness.]

Hikertrash [21k\]: Later ... we should play again 


Erithid: You played a good game, and it was pretty close. I think that you need to play a little lighter. Avoid contact plays unless you think through their consequences, they tended to work against you. Dont push from behind if you can avoid doing so, you almost always lose more than you gain. The hardest advice is what I have to work on myself, try to forsee where you will want to be and step in before the problem is out of hand. The UR in this game was going to be pretty big and I am sure you thought that you would want to cut it down, when the oppertunity to engage your oponent comes up, take it. Try to weigh the local moves against the big whole board moves. Think globally, constantly assess the strength of your groups and your enemies, and you will get much stronger. Also, I really dont think the stone at d4 was what you wanted. You never used it. You might want to study fuseki and look at pro games to get an idea of where you want the game to flow so that your initial bases will be more effective. I hope that I have helped you a little. This is my first review. Take care and good luck with your studies! ~Erithid]
