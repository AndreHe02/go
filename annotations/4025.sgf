C[In this game I tried different opening tactics, such as invading early to disrupt moyo as well as trying to play globally, not just playing local moves. This is the first game where I've really tried to pay attention to these aspects, so any comments on when I should have played locally, or elsewhere would be appreciated.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[pd];W[dp];B[jj]C[SC: This center stone will be difficult to use effectively.  Unless Black has a specific plan in mind for this stone, playing standard opening moves on either the third or fourth line would be better.]
;W[jp]C[SC: White's stone will be of more immediate use than Black's center stone]
;B[qn];W[jd]C[SC: Good, the white stone at K4 makes it less important to respond locally to Black's approach move. So, playing somewhere other than the lower right corner is best for White.]
;B[ke]C[SC: Black's move starts a contact fight.  Usually, a contact fight allows both players to build up walls.  White should decide on a general direction for the wall to go.  Two choices would be to build a wall along the top side to make a more secure group, or towards the left side with the intent of later attacking the Black stone in the upper left corner.]
;W[kd];B[le];W[md]SQ[mc]C[SC: Black can cut at M16 if white plays here.  Playing this white stone at the square instead makes it harder for black to cut.
See the variation starting next move.]
(;B[nf];W[me]TR[le][nf]SQ[mf]C[SC: This move threatens to cut black's stones.  Don't bother doing this unless white really plans to cut.
When black has two stones that are a small knight's move apart (triangles) then white playing on either spot between them (squares) is a threat to cut.]
;B[mf];W[ne]SQ[md]C[SC: White didn't cut, so the previous move was wasted.  If white had only the two marked stones, rather than the current three stones, white's position would be equally secure.  So, the stone at N15 doesn't serve a useful purpose.]
;B[oe];W[ld];B[if]SQ[hc][hd]C[SC: This move will help block white out of the center.  Playing on either of the squares would help keep white from extending along the top side.  Since it is easier to make territory on the sides than in the middle, I think it is more important for black to protect the upper side than to protect the middle.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[he];B[fe];W[cc]SQ[dj][cg][co][pk][qj]C[SC: There are still large areas of the board with no stones. White will gain more by playing some more opening game moves. Any of the squares would be reasonable options for white at this time.  The approach move in the upper left corner is played one line farther away from the corner than normal because of the black stones at F15 and H14.]
;B[ce];W[dc];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[cd];B[cf]SQ[be]C[SC: Playing this stone at the square will put more pressure on white.]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[hc];B[gb];W[fa]SQ[eb][ea]C[SC: Playing at one of the squares would be better.  With the current move, white still has to connect at E18 as soon as black plays on G19.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[ga];W[eb];B[gd];W[id];B[ge]C[SC: This is an important move for black.  Black's stones are now all connected and stronger.]
;W[pj]C[SC: Good];B[oj]C[SC: Black starts another contact fight.]
;W[pi]C[SC: If white is going to move along the side, moving towards black's weaker stone in the lower right is better.  Black will have to spend some moves defending that stone and so black won't be able to contain white along the side as well.]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[pm];W[pl]C[SC: This is another threat to cut and should only be played if white intends to follow through with a cut.  If white just wants to move towards the lower right corner, then play this stone at R8 instead.]
;B[om];W[ol]C[SC: White did cut, so the pevious move was useful.]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[on];W[oi];B[mj];W[nk];B[nj];W[ml]
C[SC: White is keeping blacks groups seperate and white's own stones in one group.  This is very good]
;B[ll];W[lm];B[mn];W[lk];B[kl]TR[lm]SQ[lk]C[SC: White has more than one vulnerable stone.  You need to think carefully about which one to save.  Playing to the right of the stone marked with a square will connect it to white's main group and put pressure on the "L" shaped black group at P10.  This black group can run towards the black wall around N14, however, so putting pressure on it doesn't do a whole lot.
Playing at L6 helps connect the stone marked with a triangle to the white stone at K4.  This threatens to surround the 2 black stones at N6.  These two black stones are more vulnerable so this is the better area to play.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[km];B[no];W[nl];B[np];W[mp];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[mq];B[kr]TR[kn]SQ[lm]C[This move seemed like a mistake on black's part, what would have happened had he responded differently?

SC: I think that these black stones have been dead since white played at the triangle to save the stone marked with the square. Black is probably hoping that white will make an error and allow black to escape, but as long as white is careful, these black stones can't survive.
I think that black played this particular move to avoid making bad shape with an empty triangle.]
;W[kq];B[co];W[fq];B[do];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[fp]C[SC: This just allows black to connect his stones without wasting a move.
The area around D10 is starting to look like a very large area of black territory.  White should do something to prevent all of this area going to black.  
An invasion around C9 would reduce black's territory the most, but only if white can make a live group on the left side.  
White could also push in through the large gap at H7.  This won't reduce black as much, but is also less dangerous for white.]
;B[eo];W[hp]C[SC: White doesn't need to connect the lower left corner with the stones around K4 since both groups are strong.  Playing here now allows black to start closing the gap around H7 and possibly secure a huge amount of territory around D10.]
;B[ho];W[io];B[gp];W[gq];B[go];W[ip];B[in];W[cj]C[SC: Since white allowed black to close off the gap around H7, an invasion is the only option left.]
;B[dj]SQ[cl]C[SC: This is not the best way to kill white.  You don't kill with contact fights.  Generally, the best way to kill a group is to play about one space away in a direction that cuts off eye space. The square is a good example of this.  White will want to expand along the left side to make eye space. A black stone at the square would make it very hard for white to expand that direction and helps keep white from connecting to the stone a C4.  Black should worry less about white expanding into the center since there are no white groups to run towards.]
;W[ci];B[dk];W[ck];B[cm]C[SC: This is a better move by black.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[di];B[ei];W[bm];B[bn];W[am];B[an];W[bl];B[ch]
;W[bh];B[dh];W[bg];B[bf];W[ag];B[af];W[cg]C[SC: This doesn't really help white make a live group.  Either way, white has to connect at B11.  If white doesn't play here now, white can play here later as a ko threat.]
;B[dg];W[ai];B[bd];W[bc];B[ac];W[ab];B[ad];W[ba];B[je]
(;W[qr]SQ[oo]C[SC: Playing this move at the square is better since it would cut black into two weak groups.
See one of the variations for an example of this.
Also, white can still reduce black's center territory by pushing in at K8.  
See the long variation for an example of how this might happen.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[op];W[pq];B[or]C[SC: Now that black's stones here are all one group, white will have to make 2 eyes in the corner before black kills this group.]

;W[rq];B[sq];W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[sn];W[so]C[SC: Slow down and play more carefully.]
;B[rp];W[sr];B[sp];W[rs]C[SC: Now white is alive, but black has only 1 eye]

(;B[pn]C[SC: Black needs to focus on making a second eye.  Black is better off allowing 2/3 of his stones to be cut off and captured in exchange for making a second eye than if he keeps all of his stones connected into one large dead group with only one eye.
See Variation for a better black move.]
