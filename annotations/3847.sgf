C[[Way*\] Hi, this is an IGS game, and I am WayFarer, playing black.  Thanx in advance for reviewing my game.  I think I know the parts I made mistakes at, but I would like a higher level analysis beyond what I did in my self-review.

[Way*\] I had put in a lot of comments that might be unnecessary, as they are simply my thoughts on the game.   If they are wrong, please point them out.

Ben: Hi. I've tried to put "Ben:" in front of my comments. Also, I should mention that there are some variations in the game that aren't referenced in the comments in the main line, so keep your eyes open. Apart from that, have fun! I hope this review will be useful.]
;B[od];W[dd];B[oq]C[[Way*\] I wanted to experiment with a new opening style.  I've used the 5-3 point often, but I've rarely used the 5-4 point.

B: That's fine. There's nothing wrong with experimenting in the opening.]
;W[dp]C[Ben: White makes it hard for you to figure out how to use the right side. F3 and f17 would be okay, in my opinion. Also r4 or something similar in the top right would be fine too, but perhaps not as interesting if you're trying to experiment.]

(;B[jp]C[Ben: Feels a bit overconcentrated, inefficient on the bottom side. Like you are asking White to push you in from both sides (assuming he gets the corner, which he can have now if he wants).]
;W[qp]C[Ben: He thought so too, perhaps :)];B[po]C[Ben: Good.]
;W[qo];B[pm]C[[Way*\] I prefer this over the Q6 point.

Ben: I don't know joseki, but this seems okay to me. I'd be worried about W q4, etc., but... see variation for White's next move.]

(;W[qn]C[[Way*\] This is not joseki.  White crawls an extra space on the third line as compared to the normal joseki where black moves at Q6 instead of the move in the game (at Q7).

Ben: Like I said, I don't know joseki. But... this move doesn't seem so bad given your response. White must do somthing here - Black at r6 would be wonderful.]
;B[pn];W[ql]C[Ben: And of course, after r6, this jump seems reasonable.]
;B[fq]C[Ben: Good. You gotta use that great strength you built up.]
;W[dn];B[fo]C[Ben: I'm not so sure about this one. White's ultimately going to want to invade or reduce the bottom side, and at the moment, neither is going to be hard to achieve.]
;W[pr];B[or]C[[Way*\] I thought this move that I made was sente b/c I could follow up at R3.  However, I did not realize White had a response at Q4, so this move is not sente.  Honestly, I don't know if it is worth making this gote move.  There are lot of other big moves on the board.

Ben: You're right, but I think this exchange is good as it stands for White (not that you played wrong - just that q2 was a reasonable move).]
;W[fm]C[[Way*\] White limits Black's moyo, and this move works well with the White stone on the upper left 4-4 point.

Ben: I'm not convinced that this works well on the left. Black can easily break up the whole side with an invasion at c11 (which I think you did later on). And as I said, invasion and reduction of the bottom side should still be easy.]

(;B[ci]C[Ben: This is good. White will have to make moves to solidify the bottom left, but the White stone above has no support either.]
;W[ck]C[Ben: This doesn't feel like it works well with f7. Now f7 feels like it should be at e9, or not played at all. And White c13 instead would be worse, giving Black a chance to aim at cutting off f7.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd]C[[Way*\] Black claims what I think is a liveable position on the left before White can make a framework.

Ben: Yes. Black's fine, and there are weaknesses at c17 and h17.]
;B[qd]C[Ben: Good. But wouldn't you rather p16 was at p17? ;)

The top and the right side are both big now.]
(;W[jc]C[Ben: I think it's better to play n17 straight away - challenging Black to stop White from getting the whole of the top side. I suppose White plays here because he has a good follow-up at n17. But r10 is a really big move too.]

(;B[lc]C[[Way*\] I think this is a mistake.  R11 is a bigger point in relation to the P16 shimari, and it lets me use the aji created if I wedge in at R7.  However, I was thinking tihs might be sente b/c it allows me to invade at H17.

Ben: The right side is definitely bigger than h17 right now. M17 secures the corner, but you can indirectly achieve the same by playing on the right side, making enough strength there not to have to worry about an attack into the corner.]
;W[qh]C[[Way*\] And I lose the opportunity to take the huge point in this area.

Ben: Yes, but frankly, I think this goes to far. Let's see if an invasion can work straight away...]

(;B[ok]C[[Way*\] This was in preparation for Black to move at R3.  As I said before, I didn't see that white could respond by moving at Q4.

Ben: R3 just isn't that big, because it is gote (see variation). If you want to play a big move, play h6, h7, k7, or p9 as a forcing move first, and then one of the others.]
;W[be]C[[Way*\] I'm not sure if I should've answered this.  I did lose this group eventually...

Ben: No, this is no great attacking move. We'll look at why you lost this group later. In the mean time, it protects the top left corner, but Black r10 looks pretty good now.]
;B[qq]C[[Way*\] I try out the sequence.

Ben: It's just not that big.];W[pl];B[ol]
(;W[qr]C[Ben: Why doesn't he just play q4? It's not like you'd be able to play q3, right? (see variation) In fact, I think even s3 would be better than this.]
;B[pp];W[rq];B[pq];W[rk]C[[Way*\] I solidify my wall in sente.

Ben: White has given way with this sequence. R3 could have been captured, and safely.

[Way*\] Positional Judgment: White has two corners and a side (40 points), and I have a moyo (23-32 points).  My upper right corner is still invadeable, as is White's left corner.  My upper right corner is a bit more secure than the lower left corner.  White has a target to attack: the black C14 group.  In conclusion, I felt I was behind, and had to play more aggressively.

Ben: It's hard to say. White is big in the top left and bottom right, but your moyo is big (I'd say about 30 points). D2 is really big, though.]
;B[ec]C[[Way*\] I begin an invasion on the upper left.  I'm not sure if this was strategically sound.  White would gain power attacking my invasion, and use that power to attack the C14 group.  I wasn't sure if I was winning, though.

Ben: You should feel that this is a tad too late, because White has already played b15. d2, h7 (or thereabouts) are big moves. Also, I couldn't say it would be a bad thing to protect the group on the left with a move like e11. The move played, on the other hand, with give White more thickness with which to attack the group on the left. I'm guessing this played a part, but more on that later.]
;W[ed];B[hc];W[gb];B[he];W[hb]C[Ben: The Black stones are light now - you needn't protect them.]
;B[co]C[Ben: You must have realised that d2 was big sente. C3 looks like big gote, too, if you're inclined (though I'd go for d2). But if you're going to play a move like c5, you need to be sure you know where you're going with it.]
;W[do]
(;B[cq]C[[Way*\] I think this is a bad move.  I should've played F14 or G13, which would've loosely connected me.  This sequence here ends in gote for me, which I could not afford.

Ben: Actually, you should still be able to ignore the left, I think, but we'll see later. Incidentally, f14 is a little better than g13 - the one point jump is never wrong, right? Oh, and wouldn't d2 instead be sente (or at least threaten to save c5)? (see variation) This way, White gets the option of closing you into the corner and getting thickness with which to attack the Black moyo.]
;W[dq];B[dr]
(;W[cp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr];W[gp]C[Ben: I think it's a little aji-keshi. The weakness at f4 would still be useful in the reduction of the Black moyo.]
;B[fp];W[ff]C[[Way*\] And now I get cut - two weak groups.

Ben: h17/h15 are still fairly light (it would take enough moves to capture them that it wouldn't be worth it). The left side, on the other hand, needs worrying about.]
;B[dk]C[Ben: e11 would be okay, but this turned out okay (short term) too.]
;W[cj];B[dj];W[bi]
(;B[gi]C[Ben: Too far. My general rule is: don't jump two spaces (in the centre) unless you have support on two sides. In this case, you'v only got support from one side (left), and there are White stones bearing down on you from two sides (f7 and f14, below and above).]

(;W[ch];B[di]C[[Way*\] I had considered sacrificing the C11 stone and make shape by going at G9 or something around there, but that would induce White H7, and then White has a foothold into my moyo.  I also thought I could cut off the D6 group and do something with that.

Ben: Yes. There are good prospects here. White is sort of thin.]
;W[bg]
(;B[cl]C[Ben: See variation.];W[dl]
(;B[bl]C[Ben: Even e8 is good (White has a hard time with f7).]
;W[bj];B[dm]C[Ben: e8 was still an option! When there are two ways to atari, you should ALWAYS consider both, and only play one when you are sure it's better than the other.]
;W[el];B[em];W[en];B[cm];W[fl]C[[Way*\] I had expected White to go F6 instead of F8.]
;B[fn];W[cn];B[bo];W[bn];B[hm]C[[Way*\] I end up losing the C7 stones, and my group at D11 is still weak.

Ben: You get to make your moyo really big, so the game's not over yet. But all your stones in the top left quarter of the board are weak, and you could have done much, much better (if you'd cut off f7).]
;W[hl]
(;B[im]C[Ben: Maybe j8 would be okay?]
(;W[il]C[Ben: White needs to attack stonger, like j11 perhaps.]
;B[ge]C[Ben: White has too many good ways of responding to this. Consider White f12.]

(;W[fg]
(;B[jh]C[Ben: Too thin. The one space jump (j11) should be okay.]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[kl];B[gk];W[gl];B[kn];W[jm];B[jn]
(;W[bp]C[Ben: What? Why isn't White attacking? Surely he doesn't think you'd ignore a move that attacked the floating Black group? (see variation)]

(;B[fe]C[[Way*\] I thought I had a chance at capturing these two stones.

Ben: White playing gote in the bottom left is a really good time for you to start playing forcing moves. k9 would be a really good start.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[hg]
(;B[hf]C[[Way*\] This was a huge blunder.  I thought I could use the slapping tesuji, and so I instinctively answered it without reading out the followup sequences.

Ben: Instinct is good, but it's best not to let it run rampant. In fact, most go problems are situations where the obvious move is wrong. The move you should have played was g13, I think.]
;W[gg];B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[kc]C[[Way*\] This was also a mistake.  I assumed White would play J18 in response.

Ben: Assumption is even worse than instinct :) In this case, the obvious j17 looks okay.]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[ig];B[jg]C[[Way*\] I decided to sacrifice the H15 group b/c I needed to save the D11 group.  This is the price I pay for having two weak groups.

Ben: Yes, it looks hard to save both.];W[if];B[ib];W[ic];B[jb]
C[Ben: You're trying to force White, but you get practically nothing in return, and actually damage your own position - k15 is not the sort of move you want to force White to play!

What's worse, it doesn't look like White has to play k15 anyway! See variation for White's next move.]

(;W[je];B[ii]C[[Way*\] I end up losing the original C14 stone, as well as my invasion at H17.  I also failed to reduce much territory around the C5 area.]
;W[pe]C[Ben: This is aji-keshi. White had prospects in the top left.]
;B[pd];W[kj];B[jf]
(;W[ie]C[Ben: Neither of you read this out. White does not need to play j15, for the same reason he didn't need to play k15 earlier.]

(;B[oe]C[[Way*\] Is this bigger than R15?

Ben: My instinct would be to play s14, but if you want to be severe, you should consider q14.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[qf];W[pf];B[sf]C[[Way*\] Another blunder.  I thought I had a ko tesuji here.  Turns out I need a black stone at R17 in order for the tesuji to apply.

Ben: Yes. Don't make that mistake again. Truly, you should always read these things out to make sure.]
;W[qg];B[ps];W[rd];B[sd]C[Ben: You still didn't read?];W[rc]
C[Ben: Ouch, that really hurts.];B[qb];W[qc];B[pb];W[rb];B[ra]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[sg];B[sb];W[se]C[[Way*\] This whole sequence cost me about 12 points.  Combined with the failures on the left side, the game is lost.

Lessons from this game:

- The knight's move is thin! It is strong when played along the side (3rd to 4th line), but don't let that fool you. It can be very weak when played towards the centre, and any weakness should be kept in mind. In this game, you could have cut off f7, and it would have solved all your problems.

- Don't jump two spaces unless you have a lot of local support. The one space jump is a very good way to jump out, and should be underestimated. There is a saying, after all, that "the one space jump is never wrong".

- Don't play forcing moves, e.g. g15, j18, unless you're sure they leave you in a better position or you're sure leaving it another turn will give your opponent a good way to remove it.

- Do take the opportunity to play forcing moves when your opponent takes gote in the middle game (e.g. White b4).

- Instincts are good in the opening and in running fights, but don't trust them in tactical situations - always read it out (e.g. the slapping tesuji, the ko tesuji).

That's all for now. Email me at ben.bildstein@gmail.com if you have any questions. Similarly, if anyone else is reading this review, feel free to e-mail me with any questions about it, even if you are a really low rank, or corrections if you're a higher rank :)]
