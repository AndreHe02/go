;B[dp]C[Dear Reviewer!

I am particular interested in the opening of this game. I found
tons of mistakes my opponent made, nevertheless I came out with
a great disadvantage. Sadly enough I cannot find any mistake
I made....


f: Hi Matthias

opening theory is very difficult; if you ask 100 players you
get 100 answers, so do not believe everything.
anyway I will do my best to help you.

PS: Go-players never make mistakes!!!; maybe they are unlucky
or the opponent is ....];W[po];B[dc];W[pd];B[nc];W[qf];B[jd]
;W[ce]C[f: D15 is better to avoid a black mojo; but that will not loose
amateur games.];B[ed];W[dh]C[f: I would play C12; now C10 is a very good attack]
;B[cj]C[f: I think: exchanging E10 for D8 is ok; an invasion on the black
left side is an illusion anyway.]
(;W[fq];B[ej];W[ci]C[sita: Well, disregarding what I said in the beginning, this might
be a mistake I made. I am in an uncomfortable position there
and cannot really say what to do...

f: Yes this is to small; you should run into the centre (F13
or F12)];B[bi];W[bh];B[di];W[ch];B[eh];W[bj]C[sita: I was happy getting this in sente and making live.]
;B[bk];W[ai];B[ck];W[eg]C[f: You talk about sente? your group is alive!  this gives you 5 points, but black gets big thickness in the
centre!];B[fg];W[fh];B[ei];W[ff];B[gg];W[ef];B[ge];W[cq];B[cp]
C[sita: Again I was happy getting the corner and I had the feeling
of making him overconcentrated...

f: You are right black D3 would show more fighting spirit, but
is not so easy.];W[dq];B[ep];W[gr]C[f: why not G3?];B[pq]
(;W[np]C[f: Playing for influent seems not wise in this situation, because
black is strong in the centre and you can not expect much territory.
I would play for side territory with R3.
Black can not get much on the lower side because of your strong
position in the lower left corner and the black centre is still
open.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp]C[f: one move to much? Q11 would make nice territory. The lower
side is very small.];B[qh]
(;W[pb]C[Do not let black make a base in your sphere of influence! You
have to fight with R10.
The corner is not in danger now.];B[qd];W[qe];B[pc];W[qc];B[oc]
;W[rd]C[sita: And again, getting a secure corner for free.

f: Yes; funny sequence!];B[qk]C[sita: But now, as I look around the board, I have nothing and
he has everything. I could as well resign now.

f: Yes; so it makes no sense to fix up this result with moves
like this. You must play more aggressive. L16 or M17]
(;W[go];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[lq];B[gm];W[ob]C[f: do you think this is a double sente?

This is a endgame move! It helps black to protect his aji at
M17. The white  corner is strong and black will have no sente
move.];B[nb];W[cc];B[cb];W[fd];B[fe];W[ee];B[gf]C[f: it looks dangerous, but I see no better way to play for white]
;W[bc];B[fc];W[jc]C[f: to late, you can play this move before exchanging P18-O18
and B17-F17; L16 is better now];B[kd];W[eb];B[db];W[id];B[ie]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[gc];B[gb]C[sita: Mh, no comments needed on this one :) Now I definitly should
have resigned.];W[hm];B[hl];W[il];B[im];W[hn];B[jm];W[hk];B[gl]
C[sita: I deleted the further moves, because it was really not
go, what I played there. Somehow I managed to capture quite some
stones and win the game, but I don't want to bother you with
the details. Anyway, the first moves were decent go. How could
I came out with such a disadvantage?

f: I hope, I could gave you some answers. If you really won this
game your a good fighter ;-)])
