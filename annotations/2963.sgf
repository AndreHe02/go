C[I (black, stlWill) feel like I have a really weak opening, but I'm not sure where to improve on it.

SC: I will preceed my comments with my initials like this.  Be sure your SGF viewer can show you the variations I have added.]
;B[qd];W[oc]
(;B[pf]C[SC: An important part of the opening is spreading your stones all around the board to "sketch out" areas.  You fill in the details later.

This move is not bad, but playing in another corner is also a good idea at this time.  See variation.]
;W[oe];B[pd]SQ[pf][qd]C[SC: This move is bad at this time.  This is a perfectly good middle game move, but we are still early in the opening.  Even without adding this stone, the two marked black stones are safe enough.  I don't think that White can cut them apart, and they have room to extend down the right side or to move farther into the upper right corner.
Don't play middle game moves until the middle game.  Black should play in another corner now.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[qf];W[jd];B[cd]C[SC: Good.];W[og]TR[pf]
[qf][qe][qd][pd]SQ[qh][qb]C[SC: Black is safe enough for now and should ignore this white stone and play in an empty corner.  
One way to decide that the black stones are safe is to count their liberties.  These black stones have 8 liberties.  A group with 6 or more liberties is generally safe enough to leave and play elsewhere.
Another way to decide is to note that this group can extend in 2 directions to make eyes.  Either of the squares is a good extension for black.  So, even if white blocks one side, black can still extend the other direction.  Black should not play on either of the squares now.  Instead, black should wait until after white plays on one square, and then black responds by playing the other.]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[pb]C[SC: This is bad.  Again, black is safe and should play in an empty corner.]
;W[pc];B[qc]SQ[pb]C[SC: Black will gain more by playing in an open corner than by connecting to the marked stone.  Since playing at Q18 was a bad move, Black should not waste more moves trying to save it.  Instead, let white spend 1 or 2 moves "finishing it off" while Black plays in the two open corners.  Black's main group around R15 still has plenty of room to make eyes against the side even if white plays at R17.]
;W[ob];B[qb]C[SC: Black would still be better off playing this stone in a open corner and letting white kill the Q18 stone.]
;W[cf]TR[db][ec]SQ[ee][de]C[SC: The black stone in the upper left corner can extend to safety in two directions.  Playing either of the squares extends into the center.  Playing either triangle takes the corner.  So, sort of like the situation I mentioned at move 12, black should not play on either area now.  Instead, take Sente and play in an empty corner.  Once white has played on one of the marked spaces, then black responds by extending in the other direction.]
;B[ec];W[fc]C[SC: Black has solid control of the upper left corner now.  So, black should not waste more stones securing a secure group.  Instead, ignore this white stone and play in an open corner.]
;B[fd];W[ed]
(;B[dc]SQ[ee]C[SC: E15 is better.  See the variation.];W[ef]
;B[ee];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[fb]TR[ee][fe][fd]SQ[de]C[SC: D15 is better.  Playing D15 connects the three marked stones to black's corner stones and makes the whole collection of black stones in this area secure.  Once they are secure, black can go back to playing in the empty corners.]
;W[gc];B[gb]C[SC: This is an endgame move, so don't play it now.  Almost all of your opening game moves should be on the third or fourth line. Think carefully and look for better options before playing an opening game move on the 1st or 2nd line.]
;W[ff];B[de];W[df];B[ce]SQ[fd][fe][ee][de]C[SC: Black doesn't have to connect here yet.  Black can connect these four stones by playing at either C15 or D16.  When you have two ways to connect, then there is no urgency to play either one right away.  Playing C15 increases black's score by 1-2 points over what it would be if White plays C15 and black connects at D16.  There are lots of places black can play that are worth more than 1-2 points.  So, playing any place worth more than 2 points is better than playing this stone.  Playing anywhere in the lower half of the board is worth a lot more than 2 points.]
;W[hg];B[dp]C[SC:  Good!  Notice that we are up to move 39 before any stones at all are played in the entire lower half of the board.  That is at least 34 moves too late.
The opening is all about spreading your stones loosly over the whole board.  In fact, a good way to decide where to play in the opening is to look for the largest open space on the board and play in it.  This rule works until there are no spaces wider than about 4-5 lines between stones.  Once the open spaces are fill up to this degree, the middle game will be starting.]
;W[dl]C[SC: This in not the largest open space, so this is not white's best move.  Eventually, extending down the side from white's wall is a good idea for white, but not while an entire corner is still open]
;B[pp]C[Perhaps I should have moved closer to W?

SC: No, this is the best area for either black or white to play right now.  This is the biggest open space.]
;W[jp]SQ[fq][nq]C[SC: Right now, the largest open space is between black's stones at D4 and Q4.  White has made a good choice by playing somewhere between these two black stones.  White could play an approach move at either square and it still would be considered playing in the largest open space and still be a good move.]
;B[pn]SQ[pp][pi]C[Larger encloser? Perhaps at R7?

SC:  The largest open space is between Q11 and Q4 currently, so this is the right area to play.  There are several good choices within that area.  Playing closer to the Q4 stone, like black did here, is good for securing corner territory.  Playing closer to Q11 will increase the chances of a fight breaking out.  So, if you want a fight, then play Q9.  If you don't want a fight, then Q6 or R6 is better.]
;W[pl]SQ[fq][nq]C[SC: White should play around one of the squares since those open areas are larger than the space between Q6 and Q11.  Similarly, black should  play his next move in one of these two largest open areas on either side of K4.]
;B[mq];W[gq]TR[hg][ff][ef][df][cf][og][oe][od][oc][ob]SQ[di]
[mc]C[SC: The opening is now over and the middle game begins.  I say that the opening is over because we have run out of large empty spaces between stones.  Playing between any stones now will be close enough to other stones to count as some sort of invasion or attack.

In the opening, you sketch out the broad outlines of territory you would like to have.  So, in this game, black seems to want territory in all four corners and some on the right side.  White seems to want territory on the top and left sides as well as some on the bottom.  Black's position looks the best.  It is very hard to win a game when you don't control any of the corners.

The middle game is about trying to make adjustments in the areas you have sketched out.  This means invasions and attacks designed to enlarge one player's area while reducing the opponent's area.
Attacking a strong group won't accomplish much.  Both of black's top corner groups are strong.  So, White will not accomplish much by trying to invade either of these corners.  White has two strong walls marked with triangles.  Black will not accomplish much by invading around N17 or D11.
Black could try attacking the  two white stones on the lower side.  Black shouldn't expect to kill them.  Instead, black's goal is to expand his lower side territory while white is busy defending these stones.  Black could also try to drive the D8 stone up the left side toward white's wall.  Playing F8 would be one way for black to start.]
;B[cn];W[bl];B[fq];W[gp];B[fp];W[gn];B[ln]C[I kept feeling it was necessary to jump towards the middle. This seemed the best oppertunity.]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[nn];B[mn]TR[ln]SQ[mo]C[SC: I think that N5 is better.  N5 keeps the marked black stone connected and makes it harder for white to extend down from O6.]
;W[on];B[no]SQ[op]C[SC: P4 would do a better job of keeping white out of the corner.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[po];B[qp]SQ[pn]C[SC: This move sacrifices the marked stone to secure the corner. I agree that securing the corner is more important right now.]
;W[qo];B[ml]TR[ic][lq][qi]SQ[mn][ln]MA[bn]C[SC: This move doesn't do much for black.  Black has already created a defect in white's center.  The two marked stones already do a good job of preventing white from claiming the center.  
Some better moves for black are marked.  Each of the triangles extends black's territory and reduces white's. The X makes the lower left corner secure.]
;W[km];B[mj]TR[ln][mn][ml]SQ[ll]C[SC: Playing M8 makes a bamboo joint when added to the three marked stones.  This would be a solid way to connect black's stones. You don't want white to cut off some of your center stones from the lower right corner group.]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[dn];B[cm]SQ[co]C[SC:  C5 connects your stones and secures the lower right corner. So, C5 is the calm, solid sort of move you make when you are winning.  C7 is an attack which could get black more left side territory, but could also result in white taking some or all of the lower left corner.  C7 is the sort of move to use if you think that you are losing.
I think that black is winning, so I would go with C5.
The reason I think that black is winning is:
Black has a lot of very secure territory in all four corners. Black could only loose this territory by playing really badly. White can't take it away as long as black defends reasonably well.
White has some potential territory on all four sides, mostly on the top and left.  White's territory is not very secure yet. Black should be able to reduce white substantially even if white plays really well.
If you look ahead to the actual end of the game, this prediction worked out.  Black did get all of the corners and did dramatically reduce the amount of white territory on the left side and in the center.]
;W[do];B[co];W[fr];B[er];W[fo];B[gr]SQ[eq]C[SC: E3 is better for protecting the corner.]
;W[ep];B[fs]SQ[eq]C[SC: E3 is still better since it helps keep white out of the corner.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[fq];W[fp];B[ir]SQ[lq]C[SC: This is not bad, but I think that M3 is a better way to reduce white.]
;W[hr];B[hq]C[SC: this is an unusual ko.];W[fr];B[hs];W[dr]
;B[fq];W[cp];B[cq];W[fr];B[es];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[cs];W[ao]
;B[bm];W[dm];B[cl];W[am];B[ck];W[bp];B[an];W[kr];B[lq]C[Should this have been at L3?

SC: N2 is best for securing the corner.  Again, play a secure move like N3 if you think you are winning and play an aggressive move like L3 if you think you are losing.]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[lo];B[mo];W[kn];B[nh]TR[ic][dk][bh]SQ[ll]C[At this point, I think I was less interested in territory and more interested in invading and neutralizing as much W area as I could.

SC: M8 is a better choice since black is strung out and at risk for being cut off in the center.  If you want to focus on reducing white, then the triangles are better choices]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[nl];B[nm];W[om];B[nk];W[ol];B[ok];W[mm];B[ll]
C[SC: The last ten moves or so in the area around N7 have not really changed the score much at all. This means that these stones have not done either player any good and were essentially a waste. Since the whole point of placing your stones is to change the score in you favor, be sure to pause and think about how the stone you are about to play is going to improve your score.]
;W[bn];B[ch]C[SC: Good.];W[ak]C[SC: This is a bad move for white.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[cj];W[bi]SQ[mf][ib]C[SC: White is crawling along the second line, which is almost always bad.  White would be better off playing one of the squares to secure the territory he does have.]
;B[ci];W[bh];B[bg];W[cg];B[bf]TR[bs][ar][ap]SQ[an][al][aj][ah]
C[SC: White would have to play on all four of the squares to save this whole group of stones.  Black shouldn't allow this, so there is no real way for white to save all of these stones.  Once white realizes that, then he should quit wasting more stones here and play elsewhere.
If White could play on all three of the triangles, he would live in the corner.  Black shouldn't allow this either, however.
White can reserve all of these marked spots to use as ko threats.]
;W[ag];B[be];W[jj];B[fj]SQ[hb][qi][ph][rp]C[Again, less interested in territory...

SC: If you think you are winning (I think that you are winning by a large margin) then you should focus on securing what you do have.  The squares are all examples of the conservative sort of moves that a winning player should make]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[dh];B[ek];W[gk];B[fi];W[fl];B[hi];W[jh];B[ik]
;W[jl]C[SC: Now black has loosly connected stones strung out across the middle of the board.  Black can probably keep them all connected, but it will take a lot of thought and effort.  Since black is winning already, why make things complicated when complicated just improves your chances of making a mistake?]

[sh][rh][pa][af][ga]SQ[oa][ja][jb][jc][kd][ld][ne][sl][rl][ql]
[so][ro][ip][hp][el]C[White resigned here.

I can't tell who's in the lead, especially with the possible invasion I was working on from the center, as well as any oppertunity I had from the top left.

Thanks for taking the time to review.

SC: lets look at the current score.  First, count your secure corner territory by imagining borders that run straight down to the edges around your groups.  I have placed triangles where we will imagine the borders of your territory to be.
Top left: 20 points
Top right: 15 points
Bottom right: 21 points.

I have placed squares where we will imagine white's borders to be.  White's borders, particularly on the top, involve more guessing. I have intentionally been generous in placing white's borders since I would rather somewhat over estimate white's territory rather than under estimate it.
Top: 14 points
Right: 9 points
Center around G6: 20 points
Center around E13: 6 points

So far things are even.  black has a firm 56 points and white has 49 less firm points and 6.5 points komi.

Now we need to look at the lower left corner and left side.  since the score on the rest of the board is very close, this area will be the deciding factor.  
If you feel that all of those white stones are dead, then black has 26 more points of territory and 14 more prisoners.  Black wins by 40 points.
If you are not convinced that the white stones are dead, then you need to focus on doing everything you can to finish killing them.

Since white resigned, white must think that all of his left side stones are dead.  As long as white has some hope of these stones living, then he should keep playing.

We never did get to the endgame.])
(;B[ee];W[dd];B[dc];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cb]TR[fc]SQ[ee][fd]
C[SC: Black has sacrificed the two marked stones but has secured about 12 points of corner terriotry.  The marked white stone is also weak, which will limit white's ability to attack the two black stones.]
))
(;B[dp];W[pf];B[pp]C[SC:  Now, black has stones in 3 corners and White only has stones in 1 corner.  The black stone at R16 is not in real danger yet, but black will probably have to work to save it.  Even if it dies, however, black is still ahead by losing 1 corner and gaining 2.]
