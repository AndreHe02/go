--- Siegoman is requesting the review ----
thank you for the review.

it is not clear to me if white was going easy on me, or if I stumbled on some reasonable attacks.

Please help me see when to focus on end game clean up, and when to attack.  I basically never shifted to end game.

my comments start with "S:"

---------------------------------------------------];B[pd]C[intangir [5k\]: Have fun.

Before even looking at the game, if your
ranks are anything like accurate, you should have
played with a large handicap.  It makes a much
better game if the handicap is set appropriately.];W[dd];B[pp]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp]C[
this looks superficially ok, but it doesn't really do it.  It hands white Sente,
and doesn't secure any territory - just leaves a weak and attackable side.

J4 instead of K4 is much better.  It still gives up sente, but at least it leaves
a defensible shape.  C2 is more common.];W[qj]
(;B[ci]C[Right idea, but the wrong place. 
See variation.];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce]C[Black's play is superficially OK up to this point,
but do you get the feeling that black's left side
is very constrained, and white's is expansive?];B[ei]C[Correct, given the poor position, black has to escape.  But consider that black's
position would be better without C14/C15.  Black would not have a cramped
side group, and white would not had 3/4 of a corner.];W[dh]
;B[di]C[I think you really have to connect at c12. instead
of here.];W[df];B[em]C[S: here I was aiming to use D11 to push C9
I got frustrated that C14 was under attack.

You really can't afford to tenuki here.  C13 is the
most obvious followup.];W[nc];B[qf];W[qn];B[nq]C[trying to secure your territory here is less important than using sente to
get your fair share elsewhere.  M17 comes to mind.  Even at face value,
as a consolidating response to R6, it doesn't really secure anything.  Trying
to do too much can be actually doing not much.];W[rp];B[qq]
;W[pl]C[S: again, getting frustrated, white has territory on right, black is squished in Q16]
;B[cm]C[this doesn't work.  D7 would be better, but the undeveloped top side is more important.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[ek];W[fl]
(;B[ld]C[S: mistake, I thought E9 might get caught in a ladder, M16 is meant as a ladder breaker, E11 stops ladder...  I wanted something more up top, this gave me excuse to move up there.

If you want to save c8, you have to stay ahead in liberties. 
B9 would be huge, because it not only saves the stones,
it reduces white's corner.];W[bk]C[now it's too late for black.  All the rest of the moves
in this area should be futile.];B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[cp]C[white: 5 black:4, looks very grim for black.]
;B[bl];W[ej]C[this is a big mistake for white.  By stretching d9 he
sacrifices e8, and indirectly gives black back the
dead attacking group.];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[dj];B[fm];W[ip]C[siegoman [13k\]: I think your ladder breaker is a bit more usefull than mine at M16. :)
siegoman [13k\]: I don't know what I was thinking.]
(;B[ho]C[S: tough move to decide on, taking with BG8 seems to let white out with WF5 or WG5, so I wanted to break ladder and separate J4 from D column.  However, taking with BG8 makes G9 much stronger to push against F10
hard for me to judge if chasing around F10 would give more profit than D5 J4 invasion would lose.

Playing  a ladder breaker this way is precarious; any white stone in a huge quadrant
of the board threatens to mess it up, because you really can't afford to lose this ladder.
It would be much better to just capture the 2 stones and get it over with, after which
you can deal with J4 from a secure position instead of a precarious one.]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[dg];B[fg];W[hh];B[fc];W[ge]C[S: I probably should have let E12 die and build up top, threatening from ouside to rescue it.]
;B[hg];W[fh];B[eg];W[gf];B[gg];W[ie];B[cg]C[
Lets reconnointer here.  Black group C11 has 
no eyes.  Why are you adding  more stones to 
it?    This tardy connection has some potential
to make 1 eye, but that 's not enough.

If anything, escape first.];W[ig];B[gh];W[hi];B[gi];W[gj];B[gl]
C[S: if taken earlier then G10 is capped... but white would not have allowed it.]
;W[ij];B[il];W[br];B[ch]C[S: hoping to rescue E12 and make life, B9 is so low maybe too late.

Right, one eye at best.  Trust your instincts in situations like this.  If there is an
escape possibility, or another eye somewhere, develop it first.   C12 now
is just wishful thinking.];W[ee];B[hf]C[here again, black is just adding to a dead group.]
;W[he]C[could be a mistake.  j14 is better.];B[if];W[jf];B[ih]
C[This looks pointless to me, but I suppose
the stakes are high enough that it's worth a try.];W[jg];B[ii]
;W[hj];B[ji]C[S: using urgent moves to threaten cap of H10 and attack on K13, maybe silly plan.]
;W[jj];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj]C[S: feeling upset that H10 escaped, want to try and trap again, but now it is leaning more towards friends at Q8.]
;W[li];B[lh];W[mi];B[kh];W[lk];B[je]C[S: thinking C11 group is dead, trying to rescue.  K13 seems dead if M12 can live.  also E14 F15 combo may get G15 group]
;W[mh];B[lf];W[ic];B[mg]C[S: probably too risky, but I thought I could escape on right if K14 lives, better to stop expanding white right side.]
;W[ke];B[jd];W[kd];B[jc];W[kc];B[jb];W[kf];B[ib]C[S: L12 has escaped, but L14 has also escaped.  fall back to secondary plan of killing G15 group with E14 F15 combo, if I can atari with G16 when he stops at F16 then G15 dies in snapback

Your fixation on chasing and killing groups, plans and fallback plans, etc. is misapplication of mental resources.  Once this kind of ugly fight starts, anything can happen,
but the most likely thing, by far, is that the weaker player
gets killed.

You should focus on sound development of a fair
share of territory.  If you're scrambling to keep your
groups alive, you've probably already lost.];W[lc];B[le];W[pc]
;B[od];W[ng];B[nf];W[md]C[S: white is making much profit attacking M14 group]
;B[nh];W[lg];B[kg];W[og];B[mj]C[S: but there are a few urgent moves to make a lower escape plan possiblel  O12 was a throw in, and he helped twice.  happy with that.]
;W[ni];B[nj];W[oi];B[of]C[S: I wanted to pull out O10, but P14 is needed to help M14 escape.]
;W[jh]C[S: at this point white has one minute to make 5 moves]
;B[lg];W[mf];B[me];W[ne];B[mf];W[pf];B[oe];W[pg]
(;B[qc]C[S: can I buy two eyes please?  N15 heavy group is becoming a pain to tend.  maybe P17 first is better.

O16 is my immediate choice.  It pretty much seals
white's fate in this vicinity.];W[pb];B[qb]
(;W[nd]C[S: white seems better with P17 now.];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]
C[S: I got lucky on this combination, M13 group lives.
at what point in past can black think of attacking L17.  I feel I just got pushed into killing rather than actively pursuing it.]

(;W[qd];B[mc];W[qe]C[S: white gets big right side, black gets some territory, but nothing compared to R11 moyo / territory]

(;B[id]C[S: now was my chance to help O10 escape, and kill F11 group.  but I was fixated on the E14 F15 G16 combo.  bottom is too thin to win battle with O8.

I think O10 is beyond help, and therefore hope
of killing f11 is delusional.];W[ml];B[hd];W[db]C[S: and he cooperated. but again, I kill G15 and he gets a large corner.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd]C[intangir [5k\]: Dito.];W[jq]
C[
Ok, so here you have a large chunk of territory
where your preponderance of influence should
be decisive.  If white is going to live, where will
his eyes be?  J3 is the key point.  Peek
at H3 to force an empty triangle, and it is very
hard for white to make eyes.  It's still iffy, but
the damage will be a lot less even if white survives.]
(;B[jo];W[hq];B[gq];W[lq];B[oj]C[S: bad idea, this battle will only build up N8 to attack below.  black seems to have a lead, stabalize.]

;W[gs];B[iq];W[jr];B[iq]C[S: I never seem to enter "endgame" mode, and keep trying to attack.]

figured that out.];W[qr];B[pr];W[rs];B[kl];W[rc]C[S: again, he beat me to a double sente move.]

off by killing everything, but got careless.  At
