AB[pd][dp]C[Hi Jago,

I think you did well in the middle-end game part. you have alot of advantage in the middle game than you think. you were thinking that you are behind in points but however, perhaps it's not that clear that you actually are not too far behind.. with the weakness black left behind. you could easily catch up the points in end game. This game end quite early because black mis read a crucial part and allow you to capture a group. But even without it.. I think the winner will be decided from the end game.]

(;W[og];B[rg];W[nd]C[so far this is a joseki,];B[nc]LB[kd:B]
[qi:A]C[I don't like the feel of this move,, seems like black just want to take territory.. I think this is a little bit of bad attitude.  by doing this it solidfy white.

If i were black.. I would want to play at A.. and later pincer at B]

(;W[mc];B[oc];W[md]LB[ld:A]C[Connect with A is slightly better.]
;B[gc]C[although black taken quite a few territory.. but I think white is fine.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[ip];B[po];W[pm]
(;B[qq]C[bl should jump first, i think.

yes normal move for black is to one space jump at O5 first then see what white does.]

(;W[pp]C[this is not good though for white.
 
see variation.];B[qp];W[oo]C[black here settle quite easily.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[qo]
(;W[op]C[at the end.. white only get some thickness but no good target to attack. this is not satisfactory.]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[mp]C[bad move?

This is shape.. if white does not defend here.. white can find himself in trouble later on in this area.]
;B[dj]C[good move for black.. this move help to reduce white's potential. also expand black's framework.]
;W[rn];B[ro]C[this exchange has been made here (i forgot it)]

(;W[bd]LB[cd:A]C[this invasion is kind of tricky. I would suggest maybe just A to invade is better.
see variation.];B[cd]C[standard and correct];W[be]
(;B[cf]C[this move is questionable for black,, this allow white to live too easily. black should just B17 and take the corner territory and keep on the attack.]

(;W[bf];B[cg];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb]C[locally this is very good for white.. white live in the corner and in a reasonable size.
 
now white pull the game very close.];B[db];W[da];B[bg]C[slow? wh gets another corner

yes this move have no meaning. against white's corner.];W[cq]
C[I think this invasion is too early.. maybe white should consider the center]
;B[er]C[very strange move, how to punish it?

 The way you play in the game seems fine.];W[cp];B[do];W[bn]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[dq];W[cr]C[this variation is not bad for white. white get alot of cash.. also because there is a cut at C7,, black is not happy.]
;B[dm]C[White have sente is very nice.. now white gets the corner for free. black's move at E2 certainly not work.]
;LB[rn:1][ro:2]C[(this exchange has been made at move 34). My feeling was: bl has made some mistakes, has still 20 points more than white, but white's influence works better, and at this crucial point white has sente.]
;W[hk]LB[jl:A]C[is this a good point?

 I think this is too close to black's influence,, and too far away from white's framework.

maybe better off with moves around (A)];B[jj]C[black dives right in . this is good reducing move.. white have no hope of catching this stone.]
;W[ii];B[kh];W[jg]C[white put on a huge pressure on black.. but white's shape here have many weakness.. black can live easily here.]
;B[kl]LB[lj:A]C[this is a bad shape.. black should play at M10(A)]
;W[il];B[om];W[ol];B[mm];W[mn];B[nm];W[ok];B[ln];W[lo];B[qk]
C[good probing move.]
(;W[pl]C[connect is too passive.];B[ni]C[Black challenge you a fight.. like the variation you provided.. this is diffcult for both side.. but in the game, you just simply connect which lead to black live too easily.]

(;W[oi];B[nj];W[oj]C[white is force to connect like this and black live in the center.. now the game looks good for black.]
;B[kn]C[black done a good job at the center to live.. now white cannot have good attack on this gorup.]
;W[rh]C[too early, upper side is more urgent? 
this taken alot of territory.. I think is not bad.. helps white to keep the territory in balance.]
;B[qh]C[this was a mistake i think 

yes.. this move is not good. black's corner is not safe yet.]
;W[qg]C[black is force to retreat.];B[rf];W[qi]C[white have a small bonus here.Territorywise.. both white and black is pretty balance.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[jo];W[kq];B[hn]C[now white's center group under attack.. this is very good for black.]
;W[hg]C[not very beatiful, but i didnot find a better move to defend the cut at J10]
;B[kg];W[jf];B[jc];W[nh]C[to defend the cut at p15, and aim at N9

I think this move is quite good..];B[gi]C[.];W[hi];B[hq];W[hp]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[fr];W[ir];B[kf]C[at this point i think something has gone wrong for white: bl is still ahead in territory, and white's influence has become a vulnerable group. Where are the wrong moves from white? H9? K13? should white have cut the keima?

it seem like black is ahead in territory.. however, white have not lost yet.. look like black's group still have some weakness.

but overall to your question, i think H9 is main cause of this.. if white have gone around around K8 then black's invasion could not be this successful.]

;W[kc];B[nb];W[jb];B[mb];W[ic];B[ld];W[jd]C[i am not quite sure about this sequence, but it was something like this. black is messing about a little bit.

yeah, I don't understand this sequence too.];B[rm];W[rl];B[cl]
C[i am again not quite sure about the timing of this move.

this is definitly wrong timing..];W[fh];B[eh];W[gj];B[ej];W[eg]
;B[dg];W[mk]C[this is good move.. now black group in danger.]
;B[lj];W[ml];B[gl]C[no good move, i think, and bl must defend the center group

it's very difficult for black in the center. black cannot make two eyes  in the center group so he must try to connect out..]
;W[ef]C[bad move, not sente];B[os]LB[jm:A]C[black didn't realize itself in danger,, very bad mistake. if black have defended himself at A.. then the game is very close. I roughtly estimate white lead yb little bit.. if black defend at A.


End of commentary];W[kk];B[lk];W[ll];B[ne]C[black mis read.]
;W[me]C[bl thought he could capture white

perhaps. because black misread this part,, that is why black did not defend the group.]

I think white should try to do this even though this is risky. because in the game, black have a easy settlement and with that settlement. black leads quite easily.]
