C[> This was a frustrating game. I think I played a terrible opening and then afterwards I may have been overly conservative. I would appreciate suggestions for alternate strategies. Thanks!

Hi Eric!

The opening was not as bad as you think. You made a mistake in the joseki, but your opponent couldn't punish you correctly, so you gained a fairly good result.

Your loss was because you didn't attack your opponent's huge moyo bravely enough. You don't have to invade, but you should reduce enough. You ended up waving your hand in front of his nose, which only let him secure the whole moyo. See the first variation.

In any case, you have some very good ideas, but you should try to gain some courage - you usually played too conservatively, didn't attack when you could have, defended when you didn't need to. In the long run this will cost you points and games. Try playing more aggressively for a few games. Maybe you will lose, but with the experience you will learn to fight better, and when you gain skill, you will also gain the courage to use it.

Thanks for the game!

(;B[pj]C[> At this point I realized I played this opening terribly. Any suggestions as to how I could have best handled his opening?

O15 was a mistake, but so was Q10. See the variations.]
(;W[rc];B[qb];W[rf]C[At this point N16 was the only move.]
(;B[rg]C[A mistake. See the variation.]
(;W[jd]C[> I was unsure about this move. Was it a good idea? I felt it was somewhat urgent to give my stones an escape route, try to surround his stones, and hope to receive help from the influence of the stone in the upper left.

The idea was correct, but this move allows black to cut and attack. You should still play N16 to get an easy escape and put some pressure on black. See the variation.]

(;B[lc]C[Too defensive. See the variation.];W[le]C[Good move. Now the white group is practically safe. Black missed his chance to attack.]
;B[qm]C[Very small. Black should play on the left side, as there is most space to be gained in there.]
;W[dj]C[> I thought this was the biggest spot on the board, and I didn't see anything urgent

Yes, very big point.];B[lp]C[Still small! Black should play closer to one of the white corners now.]
;W[co]C[> I considered moving where my opponent moves next, but I figured this would work better for me because it secured the corner and brings the bottom stone a bit closer to the one in the middle of the side.

The white stones are a bit overconcentrated on the left now. It would be bigger to play somewhere around N10 and build a huge moyo.]
;B[iq];W[gq]C[Black and white both miss the point. The center is huge now, whomever gets it first will be the one with the moyo, and the other will have to try to break it.]
;B[jj]C[Very big! Note that the top-left corner is not yet secure.]

(;W[ho]C[This is going too easy on black. White should try to break the black moyo instead of letting him secure it - the white thickness works well in this. See the variation.]
;B[jo];W[hm]C[White should still invade. The black territory will be lot bigger than the white one.]
;B[jm];W[hj]C[The most urgent area now is around N10, which is the last wall for black to close up.]

Indeed - A play at somewhere around D13 or E13 would put black in trouble. Now he gets away too easily.]

That was your mistake.]
