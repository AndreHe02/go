AB[jj][jp][jd][pj][dj][pd][dp][dd][pp]C[Standard 9h game from a 2d+
i have blanked out my rank because it says i am 17k which is probally not true.]
;W[gc]C[DC: Hi, My name is Dylan Carter; I'll try to give you some advice where I can.]
;B[fd]C[i like this move forces white to want to get out if he doent then he traped to one side when i get a wall to the middle.

DC: Yes but why not simply playaround d14 making the area white occupies dame points, if white lives.]

(;W[gd]C[i dislike this move see varation i would like to know which is better.

DC: Getting out is standard and this move is solid.];B[fe];W[db]
;B[dc];W[eb]
(;B[cb]C[this side is still worth alot best take the points now.]
;W[ge]
(;B[dg]C[solidfy what i have];W[md];B[jf]C[2d+ is alot stronger then me id rather stay away from his white stone if possible and keep both groupd seprate.

DC: Good strategy.];W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[DC: what were you expecting white to do after this?]
;W[mc]C[DC: TYhe exchange harms the K14 stones slightly. Better/Stronger to just come out of the corner.]
;B[qd];W[nb]
(;B[ob]TR[nc][mc]C[DC: White is taking advantage of the bad exchange, drawing back is possible.]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[pb];B[pf]C[if he wants top ill take side.

DC: You have given the toip away and now have no 'attack' on white stones.

The idea of a 9 stone game is to use the stones to attack.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[oa]
(;B[qe]C[DC: In this situation black would normally cut.];W[qg]
;B[og];W[qi]
(;B[qj]C[top gorup is plenty safe p 16 is very small and dont ever intend on playing it.

DC: The problem is not here, it was earlier. The diagonal move is very distinct and strong.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[mf];W[ni];B[mh];W[qn]C[i could run with my 2 b stones but im afraid life or a recconect might be hard and would damage me alot.

DC: See var. for a meaning ful solution. White gets a few points you get quite a few.

DC: White is allways looking for complicatiuons in such a handicap game, it is up to you to simplify the situation.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[om]
(;B[mq]C[o 9 is still large and most around 15k would miss recconect
even though 2d+ wont its still a reduction with sente.];W[qp]
;B[pq];W[qq]
(;B[cp]C[very important move
this move allows me to be able to attack eithier saide that w enters.

DC: A territorial move, one should seek the oppertunity to attack.]
;W[gq]
(;B[fp]C[DC: This is a move you should try to avoid as it will generally strengthen White.]

;W[nk]C[DC: eliminates the aji.];B[hr];W[gr];B[go];W[ip];B[gl]
C[DC: Interesting idea but avoid playing the h2 g2 exchange, as this reduces ko threats]
;W[cj]C[here i know c 9 is a very badmove i need to play c 11 but i might not kill it...]
;B[ci];W[cl]
(;B[ck]C[DC: See Var.];W[dk];B[bj];W[bk];B[cj];W[dl];B[dm];W[fk]
;B[bl]C[i decide to let white go and take the ter its bigger then whites side and by chasieng maybe even killing white i should be able to win.]

;W[nn];B[no];W[mn];B[jl]C[white should be dead but hes alot stronger then i am so seems there a chance he lives]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[gi];B[gh];W[ii];B[ij];W[hj];B[hg]C[white has 1 eye and most recconect somehow]
;W[ig];B[hf];W[fh];B[gg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ji]C[hm still only 1 eyel 10 and white lives
have to l 11];B[ki];W[jg];B[jh]C[DC: Again not necessary.];W[kh]

;W[jr];B[kb];W[jb];B[hb];W[gb]C[DC: Try to think, "I will make the move with th most awesome follow up".

This way your moves will be slightly stronger in general, though your moves will be subtle.]
;B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[ha]C[there was a few tricks here for b but white saw through everything.

he didnt win even if he had it but was a fun game would like to know how i could get him at 8 next time? :P

DC: You won but, you could have attacked using the "moves with good follow up" idea to a more devestating potential.]
