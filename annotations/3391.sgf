C[Hi,
here is a game I woukd like you to review, I am playing black, during the game I was feeling I was doing good, however I lose by quite a lot (20.5), I wrote comments about what I was thinking and questions I have.

Thanks.

David.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk];W[ec];B[cn]C[I'm not sure if it was the right direction, I was hesitating with F3, but I felt it's maybe too simple

Per: Continuing at F3 or K4 would be the normal moves, but C6 is OK too.]
;W[cl];B[en]C[Per: Good choice. Entering the corner would not work well with Q3]
;W[fp];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[ck];B[dj];W[co];B[dn];W[cj];B[di]
;W[bn]C[Per: A mistake by white. It hurts the C10 group and black still has H3]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[cm];W[ch]C[White mistake?

Per: Yes. If white hadn't played B6 it would be joseki, but now white has to play C11]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[bk]C[I am pretty happy with the result, what do you think?

Per: Black has a solid lead now.];W[kq]C[I feel it was a mistake from white not to play at d12

Per: D12 is very small. 
If white plays there black dosn't have to answer and white only makes 3 points D13-D15. 
If black plays there white dosn't have to answer and black gains additional influence worth about 2 points.
All in all the move is worth about 5 points in gote.];B[dh]
;W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qm];B[hq]C[here I was hesitating with P9, I thought it was better to attack, by bottom right group is strong, and this H3 move can also give me a chance to invade at E3 later

Per: All though H3 is a good invasion point it would be to slow for white to defend there now. 
I would play P9. White would have to answer. A black followup move at P7 would just be to painful.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[mr]C[White mistake? I expected white to jump at L5

Per: Yes. When black plays L5 white will have a hard time to find a good answer.]

(;B[mq]C[I'm not totally sure about this move, another possibility is to play M4 or M5

Per: There is general rule that say. Don't touch what you are attacking. Black is strong all around so don't worry about a white cut. (see variation)]
;W[lq];B[nr];W[ko];B[lp]C[Per: This peep is not good the correct shape is O5. It protects against the atari and seperates whites groups.
Black can then peep from the other side later.];W[kp];B[hn]
;W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[im]C[better at K6?

Per: There is a nice attacking technique you can use here. 
If you play at N6, white plays L7 and black H7. Then you have succed in playing the moves you want on both sides. If you play H7 directly the white can play first against your right group. 
Such opportunities come often in running battles like this.]
;W[gm];B[mn];W[lo];B[mp];W[km];B[ik];W[qi]C[Per: White is playing with the fire. Black N8, white L9 and black Q8 would make life difficult for white.]
;B[ok];W[qf]C[Per: ???. What is white planing to do when black plays S8.]
;B[lc]C[At this point I am pretty happy, white have 5 separate groups and I have few moves for later at E3, C13/C14, the white group in bottom center is not alive yet.
Do I already lack about territory? Did I make serious strategic mistakes so far?

Per: Besides from N3 your play is fine and you are still leading. 
Playing M17 is however a seriuos mistake. White has taken territorie at the expense of leaving weak groups around the board. If you don't attack them and exploit whites mistakes it will be just like white has never made the mistakes and you will lose.
You have to play either L9 or S8. One of the white groups will most likely die and even if the don't you will still gain so much from the attack that you have a sure win.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[nn];B[mm]C[Per: Good fighting spirit.];W[on]
;B[nl];W[rr];B[rs];W[sq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ms];W[kk];B[ll]C[Per: This peep is not needed. Play S8 to prevent white from connecting at S9 and follow up with L11.]
;W[kl];B[mi];W[ij];B[jn];W[lm];B[hk]C[shouldI try at K9? I was afraid to make my black group die trying to kill white

Per: Yes, Cutting seems a little too dangerous.];W[kh];B[li]
C[black mistake? where should I play instead?

Per: Yes this is a mistake. You can cut at L11 if you get a stone at P11 later.]
;W[lk];B[nj];W[mk]
(;B[nk]C[Per: Black can protect the cut with Q11.];W[ml];B[ph]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[rl];W[rm];B[rj]C[Per: O7 first. Black can the start a ko later with T2.]
;W[pf];B[ng];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[oc]C[Per: S18];W[ic];B[of]
;W[kd];B[cg];W[bg];B[cf];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[ef]C[at this point white got his lead of around 20 points, and I couldn't change anything until the end of the game... my questions end here, however please point eventual mistakes I made or white mistakes I failed to punish in the following.
Thanks.

Per: Your main mistake is playing to passive and failing to exploit your opponents mistakes in the middle game. 
In fact you can still turn this game around by playing O7.]
