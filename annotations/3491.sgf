RE[W+45.5]

;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]C[I figured this was good as it set up for potential on the top, but is it too expensive?  Maybe something like Q13 instead?  I never feel great when I try to fight san ren sei.

paul: o16 is actually very nice.  The p17 move is misplaced.  It's not so bad in some situations, but in this situation it gives you k17/k16 as a thank you move -- which I noticed you quickly fill.]
;B[od]C[paul: p16 is terrible  It would normally go at q14 or r14 or ... well, anywhere but forming an empty triangle.]
;W[jd];B[dj];W[ch]C[this was a shot in the dark... it's a kakari/shimari, so I figured it looked good.

paul:  It's not so bad, but it doesn't do very much.  Watch out for trying to form too much 3rd/4th line territory off that 4-4 stone though.  Even with stones at c14 and f17, they can still invade the corner -- robbing your stones of purpose.  In fact, since black can play either way from d10 it's probably best to leave it alone for now.  Instead, consider using your d4 stone to build more sides like you did at the top.  o3 is still an excellent move as you can play back toward that hoshi at m4 or l4 even if black plays something passive.]

;B[di];W[fg];B[cq];W[cp]C[I blocked this way to neutralize his wall.  Does this make sense?


paul: yes.  That makes sense, however, then your influence is also neutralized. And he's already got eyes, so you can't exactly kill the poor thing.]

[hb][be][bd][bc][bb]C[I didn't want to lose that.

paul: yes, that works.  I wonder if it would have been bigger to try to break up that still intact san-ren-sei over there though.  With this move, you secure 3*6+3*4=30 poitns or so.  How much is your lower left worth?  I count 0... And he's got a lot to work with over there.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[ie];W[id];B[je];W[fe];B[gf];W[ff];B[ne]C[paul: That was odd.  g15 might have worked better for him a little deper.  He just helped you build some nice territory...]
;W[oh]C[if black lets me get too strong, I can attack his k15 stones, and if he saves those stones, I can dive into the left side.

paul: The thinking may be correct.  p12 is probably a little unusual though.  If you wish to threaten to cut off the stones, maybe p14 (aka peep) or perhaps n15?  I'd also recommend looking at o3 or q7.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[og];W[pi];B[qh];W[ng];B[of]C[I clearly blew this.  How could I have done that better?

paul: see move 50.  I also think, instead of o13, you might want to try p11.  More or less the same result, but at least you can use the stones for something and keep sente.]
;W[ni];B[qi];W[nf];B[oi];W[me];B[oe];W[gg]C[Since he let me, I was able to salvage the back up plan to that attack.  I think this move should have been at H12.  At any rate, I don't think this attack should have worked.]

paul: looked pretty good to me.  Well, if I were black I might have lived, but your thinking was correct.  Attack the weak group.  That's a winning strategy at any level.]
;B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[fr];B[es]TR[ml][nl][pl][ql]
[rl][ll]C[look for territory on the bottom.


paul: perhaps.  However, you're losing your chances to get into the lower right.  You helped him build that enormous thickness (triangles) pointed at his hoshi stone.  It makes it harder and harder to get in there.  (variation in answer to question at move 111).]

(;W[fs];B[cr];W[jp];B[nq];W[lq];B[no]C[that's a mighty territory on the left... What should I have done?

paul:   K4 is awfully slow.  It does work, but you might have been better off trying an aproach like o3 (that he's likely to answer).  Also consider q2 (unusual) and q6 (trickey because of the thickness).  The idea with o3 would be to make territory using your new thickness on the left.   I threw in a variation at move 105.]
;W[qq]TR[qn]C[What the hell, thinks I... Maybe I can make a ko.

paul: theoretically, white can *always* live there.  In practice it depends on the skill level of the players, but in theory, you can always live.  Even with a black stone at r6, you can still live!  In fact, that corner has a special name:  kannon bakari (butterfly).]
