C[Hello Mr. Hirsch. Thanks for the chance to review your game.
FYI, my strength in IGS terms is about 2k*. As far as my comments
may be useful,  please consider the following caveat.

Only a high ranking professional can know the truth about go.
Higher level amateurs merely have more sophisticated random opinions
than their lower level brethren. I tested this notion by showing
an identical SGF record to a well known and quite successful
amateur rated 4d* as well as to a well-known pro 7-dan, independently
asking each for their full commentary. What a difference. A few
(critical) things that the 4d* thought were so were, indeed,
not so. However, I did find both sets of comments worthwhile.
That's because anyone's commentary, even a weaker player's comments,
are valuable if they help us think deeper about go and thereby
enjoy the game more. I merely advise you to be humbly suspicious
of any amateur's comments.


To view this game, please set your viewer to activate the "show
next move" feature. If your veiwer is set that way, you should
see an "a" at coordinate Q16, which is the move that shall be
played next. When I refer to "a", I mean the next move to be
played. When I refer to "b" or "c" I refer to other possible
moves I have marked. If there is a variation connected with them
I will write "see variation." Also, I refer to black as b and
white as w. The difference between "b" for black and "b" for
an alternate move should be implicit from the context.

Please enjoy.

SQ[qj]C[It would be normal for b to play a pincer off the star stone
when b already has a stone around R10. Lacking this, the pincer
may be less effective. Of course it's still doable.];B[kp]C[W's a is ok, but b may be better. Since there is nothing special
going on, w should take cash. See variation.]
(;W[no];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq]C[The joseki calls for w to play at b. A is too early.]

(;W[hp]C[B immediately punishes the w omission. Good.];B[mp]
;W[np]C[Oops. B must continue with forcing moves to make w heavy. See
variation b. Instead, the b stones become heavy.

Side bar:
Light, is something that can be easily sacrificed or partly sacrificed
with flexible compensation gained elsewhere.
Heavy, is something that cannot be given up or flexibly managed.]

(;B[lm];W[nm];B[pl];W[lq]C[B may consider changing direction with b to build a nice moyo.
It's a light style. See variation.]
(;B[mq];W[mr];B[lp];W[kr]TR[kp][lp][mp][mq][lm]C[W got stronger and the black lower middle group got a bit heavy.
B now takes a big point, but its possibly an overplay, because
it breaks the strategic concept that URGENT points take precedence
over BIG points.

Side bar:
A situation is URGENT if a group is not settled or is uncomfortable.
A group is not settled to the degree it has any of these fundamental
problems; namely, liberties are short, cuts are possible, or
there is no base.

In this game, the marked group is out toward the center meaning
its liberties may be ok, but it really is not yet comfortable
because w may attack or pressure it. Perhaps strengthening it
first at b is good enough. See variation.]
(;B[pf]C[W may be too early with a. Perhaps the cap at b is more effective
to directly punish the heavy group.]
(;W[qi]C[B makes a direction error. B should approach from b instead.
It closes definite territory, whereas the top is still open.
Also, it may be more helpful to the b stones in the center.
See variation.

Side bar:
When there is a choice of direction, pick the direction with
the best secondary benefits.]
(;B[qg];W[qm];B[pm];W[rl]C[Playing at b may be severe.]

;B[qo];W[rm];B[ro];W[rg]C[This is an illustration of the proverb that, on the 2nd line,
six die and eight live. Here w has seven but with sente survives.]
;B[rf];W[sg]C[Play b instead to help the weaker stones.]
(;B[nk]C[I see no reason why w cannot just push out at b, putting pressure
on the b group and reducing naturally.]
(;W[ob]C[This is another direction error I think. Sometimes the center
territory looks bigger than it is. Since b has a weak point at
N8 and has a very wide doorline between M7 and K16, the center
cannot be confident. Better to use the center power to attack
the w invader, which may produce some territory naturally as
well as indirectly help the lower b stones. See variation b.]

(;B[nc]C[Now w plays at the weak point of a to try to force b.

Side bar:
When the opponent tries to force you, better if you can force
him right back. Of course, its not always possible, but always
look for it.];W[qe]TR[rf]C[The marked b stone is not an important stone, especially since
the right side w group is alive. Therefore, block at b. See variation.]

(;B[qf];W[qc]C[Suddenly b is concerned about this defect of a. It reveals
that O9 was not good, since, after b plays at N8 he would not
then
play at O9 at this moment.   However, b should not TENUKI from an URGENT situation. The upper
right is urgent since the w stones are not yet settled or comfortble.
B must continue there, forcing w to live as small as possible
and in gote. Black should play at b, etc. He will end in SENTE
and then can fix up at "a" if that is his judgement. (It's too
slow and passive, IMHO.)]
(;B[ml]C[W should take his SENTE moves at b, etc. See variation. Points
like b are the biggest in go, because they are DOUBLE SENTE moves.
Whoever gets them gets free lunch.]
(;W[oc];B[od];W[dk]C[Yes, a may be urgent, but b is still double sente.]
