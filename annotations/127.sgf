Comments for the GTL in May 2000 by Erik Ekholm,

Swedish 3 dan.];B[cq];W[pd];B[pp];W[de];B[qf];W[qj];B[of]LB[qc:A]
[nc:B]C[EE: Invading at r17 (a) or double kakari around o17 (b) are more normal.]
;W[nd];B[rd]C[EE: The main drawback with this exchange is that it spoils your chances to invade the 3-3 later. That means your group has less flexibility; it is heavier.]
;W[qc];B[qm]C[EE: Right, this way p14 gets a purpose.];W[oj]

(;B[ri]C[EE: This could end up strengthening the group you want to attack. See variation for the usual flow.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[pg];B[pf];W[nh]LB[mf:A]C[EE: After White's move we have a shape where it makes a big difference if White gets to play n14 (a) to shut Black in,

or if Black comes out at n14 (a). I feel Black 'a' is strongly called for.]
;B[lc];W[mc];B[oc];W[od];B[mb];W[nb];B[nc]C[EE: Trying to capture White's stone now is dubious. White's territory is small; let him have it. (Explanation will follow in the variation to move 27.)]
;W[md];B[ob]
(;W[rc];B[re];W[ld]C[EE: White misses his opportunities.];B[lb]
;W[dc];B[hc]C[EE: As the m18 group is safe, this move isn't urgent. Playing on the left side, for example, would be bigger.]
;W[fc];B[kd]LB[mf:A]C[joose: K16 or K17 better?



EE: All are the wrong direction. You would rather attack from the other side, around N14 (a), to divide the two unsettled white groups.]
;W[jc];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[hb];B[kc];W[ib];B[cg];W[ci];B[eg]
;W[cl];B[cn];W[ep];B[gq];W[eq];B[jq];W[nq];B[pq];W[lq];B[jo]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jr]
(;B[kq]C[EE: Misses an opportunity to keep him separated! (See var!)]
;W[kr];B[gr]C[EE: Fine, but ...];W[ir]LB[cp:A]C[EE: ... White should ignore this for now and play at c4 (a) and cross-cut to make eye shape.]
;B[do]C[EE: Really good. Now you will get an attack.];W[fo]
;B[go];W[fm];B[dl]C[EE: Leaning attack. Very good!];W[dk];B[el]
;W[en];B[ek];W[dj];B[ej];W[ei];B[fi];W[ch];B[eh];W[bg];B[cf]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd]C[joose: this is serious mistake. This at H7 or somewhere around would have been very nice



EE: Yes, this is merely endgame.];W[gn];B[hn];W[hm];B[fp];W[fq]
;B[gp];W[eo];B[gl]C[joose: bad move. J6 right?



EE: Agree. If you play j6, you might still get a chance to play g8 later.]
;W[in];B[ho];W[gm];B[im];W[hl];B[gk]LB[jm:A]C[EE: Too slack. Remember that you can capture E11, so there are no cutting points. K7 (a) looks better.]
;W[jm]C[EE: This capture makes White thick and hard to attack. Black's group below is weakened.]
;B[mj]C[EE: You could also leave the ladder as White's worry. If he leaves it, you might find a better ladder breaker later.]
;W[il];B[mf]C[EE: Very good! Double attack.];W[lh]C[EE: It seems both of you overlooks the fragility of the white corner (variation). Being worth around 40 points in gote, it remains the biggest area to play in for a while. :-)]

(;B[kj];W[jh];B[ij];W[dm];B[cm];W[bl];B[em];W[dn];B[bm]LB[bo:A]
C[EE: Black's shape in the corner makes me nervous. I would play b5 (a) instead.]
;W[cr];B[di]MA[dj][dk]LB[br:A]C[EE: Not surely sente! White might discard the marked two stones, since they aren't cutting stones. As the variations show, Black has a problem in the corner. Black b2 (a) might do the trick.]

(;W[cj];B[br];W[dq];B[cp];W[dr];B[fr];W[bo];B[co];W[bp];B[bq]
;W[bs];B[ar];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[ap];W[cs];B[jn]LB[lp:A][lo:B]
MA[jm][nq]C[EE: Slow. You are weak too. Your group is behind an imaginary 'sector line' between the marked stones, and it lacks eyes. Perhaps m4 (a) or m5 (b) to get out quicker?]
;W[jk];B[jj];W[kn];B[ko];W[ln];B[lo];W[lk];B[lj]C[EE: You have no time for this!]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[lp];B[mn];W[no];B[kp];W[mq];B[mm];W[ll];B[lm]
;W[km];B[kk];W[kl];B[ik]C[EE: Black has only 5 effective liberties so this is pointless.]
;W[im];B[er];W[hr];B[ml];W[gs];B[es];W[io];B[mk];W[ol];B[om]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[og];B[qh];W[ph];B[qk];W[pk];B[oi];W[ni];B[pi]
;W[mg];B[lf]C[EE: Finally Black kills the 40 point corner (by coincidence? :-) ).



Game summary:

Keep an open eye for weak groups of both colours. Don't play close to thickness and settled groups. Good luck with your go!
