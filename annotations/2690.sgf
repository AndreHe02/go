AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

this game was played, when I was 10k on KGS, against a 5k. I want to get better at handicap games. I read in "The Second Book Of Go", that one should play aggressive as black in a handicap game. But I often find, that people a couple of ranks above me are often much better fighters and it is difficult to be aggressive against them. That is probably, because I often overestimate the stability of my positions. So I try to play more solidly.

Any hints about what I need to practise or concentrate on to improve efficiently are very welcome.

Thank you in advance!

JR: Fair enough but are you particulalry worried if white does paly here? White would still be fairly thin and with strength up either side you might expect to invade reasonable easily

Personally, since black cannot reasonably excpet to stop white getting any territory I'd leave the bottom. Playing elsewhere will make it harder for white when it becomes necessary to play away from the bottom]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]C[JR: Over the next 4 or 5 moves black follows white around responding every time.

With the centre handicap stone I think black is better to play for outside influence. When white invades the centre stone should prove an advantage - white is running towards it!]

JR: And the marked stone give great potential up the side. I hate to let this move be sente so I'm thinking about less passive responses.]
;W[nm]
(;B[dj]C[JR: White's move  is looking

a) to shut black into the corner
b) to connect the two groups

I would be tempted to keep white split apart, or to play more aggressively]

;W[en];B[el];W[fo];B[gn];W[ep];B[eq];W[go];B[gm]C[I think it was worthwhile - this position seems good to me.

JR: White did well here. The initial C6 stone played deep in a black sphere of influence and it has managed to connect out.

Black gained very little.];W[ho]
(;B[jc]C[JR: This is neither one thing nor the other.

It is too far from the right corner, there is room for an invasion.

It is not close enough to the left to be the strong estattack]

This lets white jump into the gap. OK yopu can connect along the top but so much nicer not to have to]

I think these last 2 moves were weaker than the rest of your play so far.

They suggest too much emphasis on defence. At the right times cutting and attacking is the best defence.]

JR: BUT it lets white connect. Simply defending is not always enough. This helps white far too much]
;W[hh];B[hj]C[JR: Again this is simply defending a small bit of potential territory]

JR: This is fairly standard invasion when black plays the attachment joseki at C5 . White does not expect to life, simply to eat awat much of the corner]

Greetings

JR: You made no blunders but a number of moves in the opening and middle game were very slack. This is how white caught up.

I think you are too defensive. Attack is not the same as picking a fight.

In handicap black has more strength so white tend to be playing in areas where black has more stones - so is at an advantage.

Rather than try to defend everything as territory try to let white have a little, in exchange yfot you gaining even more strength. Thi sallows you to make bigger attacks on white's weak positions.

Chase stones, don't kill them. You should make territoy while chasing and let white run away making nothing.

Good Luck])

a) I think black can cope with the 3-3 invasion by taking the outisde.

b) I think this  can put pressure on the wohte stones above as well as attacking the stone at R8


It all depends how you feel about fighting.

 I feel  it is important to consider the game as a series of exchanges. Yes white may get the corner but iff black gets to capture above or below, or to split up the position on the bottom then I would judge black gets the best of the exchange.

All this is gut feel, the variations I show may well not be perfect.]
