;B[pd]C[Dear Reviewer:

Thank you for taking the time to review my game.  I played white
in this game and even though I won by a good margin, I still
would like some pointers on how I can improve my game.  It seemed
to me that black made a few silly mistakes and I did not know
best how to take advantage of them.  Any and all comments are
appreciated.

Thank you];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[jd];W[ne];B[pf];W[qn]
TR[pp][pj]LB[nq:a]C[This move is kind of questionable.  You are invading at about his strongest point, which means you are going to fight at a disadvantage.  You are already in a pincer and it's black's move.  A move around 'a' is probaby better.  Just make a moyo of your own rather than jumping to invade his moyo.]
;B[pn]
(;W[qo]C[more usual is to play out at 'a'.  See variation 2.]
;B[rq];W[ql];B[pm];W[pl];B[mm];W[jp]C[This is a huge move for white.  You will have to be careful that your group on the right doesn't get killed though.]

;B[bp]
(;W[hc]C[Should I have played another move in the bottom left?


A:  Yes.  See variation 2.];B[jf];W[hq];B[fn];W[em];B[gm];W[jm]
;B[hl];W[jk];B[hj];W[mq];B[mk];W[dh]LB[cm:a][pb:b]C[This move looks big, but is only taking points.  No sente.  A move that defends a weak group or attacks or threatens  while making points is *much* more valuable.    "a" continues to be very very big.

Your two white stones at the top left are in big trouble, so a move at "b" is huge.  If black plays there first, your stones probably die and he gets the entire top right corner.

Even after your move at D12, black can easily invade the top left, so it doesn't yield all that much profit.]
;B[cm]TR[em][dn][do][dp][eq]C[This is a very big move for black.  Now his group is difficult to contain.  Your marked group is weak and must be defended.]
;W[bl];B[dm];W[en];B[dl];W[el];B[dk];W[ej]C[White is living dangerously with this move.  Black can cut white off and white will probably die.  It's a tough fight, so I can't say for sure, but if I was black, I would cut and fight.  See variation 2.]

(;B[di]LB[dj:a]C[??  Just extending at 'a' is better.  White has too many weaknesses to cover them all.]
;W[dj]C[Black is helping white fix his weaknesses with these moves.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[bi];W[bn];B[bm];W[cj];B[ek];W[fk];B[cq]LB[fj:a]
[ei:b]C[This black move was really what saved white.  Black was alive and didn't need to move here.   Black could cut now at 'a' or even just extend to 'b'  White has many weaknesses, so black should kill something.]
;W[fr];B[dr]LB[gr:a]C[Again, black is too kind.  Black *had* to keep white's two weak groups separate.  Instead, he forces you to connect them.]
;W[er];B[bh];W[bf];B[al]C[???  Wasted move.];W[jc];B[ei]TR[nc]
[jc]C[Why did black not attempt to stop me from connecting my marked
groups?

Agreed.  Letting you rescue the top left stones was enormous.]
;W[fi];B[ii];W[kd];B[je];W[gg]TR[bf]C[What is the best way for black to invate my moyo at this point?
A 3-3 invastion?  Is this critical for black at this point?

I think 3-3 is best, and yes, it is huge.  It may be a difficult fight because of your marked stone, but black should live there.]
;B[ak]C[From this point on, black's game really falls apart leaving white free to devour points.]

(;AW[cm];B[fc]TR[cm]C[A simple move here does a lot.  If black ignores it...    If black doesn't ignore it, then you have extended your center group and closed off his lower left corner in sente and you still get to make your move on top.

The weakness in your groups left by not making this move could have cost you a great deal.]
;W[bn];B[cr];W[dr]TR[fp][fq];B[br]TR[fp][fq]C[If black ignores it and you capture, you are now extremely thick (strong) in the area, which makes the two marked stones pretty worthless for black.]
