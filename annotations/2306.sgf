GC[This is the second time 
i have played Ian with 8 stones, the first time I lost by 30
points (b33 w63). Previous games have been with 9 stones.]

AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello Ian.];W[cm]C[This is an approach move that im not used to, which has happend to 
me twice now.];B[gp]C[I decided to play this move instead of something more aggressive, 
although i would have liked to know how to put pressure on the stone, 
perhaps at c6?

crazyd - not C6, but C5 seems okay [don't contact weak stones is usually 
good advice\]];W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[do]C[crazyd - Maybe B3 would be better than D5.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np]C[I feel this gives me a good frame work on the lower part of the 
board, perhaps with a weakness around m4

crazyd - I agree];W[pf];B[of]C[crazyd - maybe too ambitious.  R8 or E7 better [same contacting weak 
stones problem\]];W[og];B[nf];W[ph];B[ng];W[nh];B[pe]C[i feel i had created some outward influence and also developed good 
potential teritory around the upper right hand side.];W[pl]
;B[oi]C[I decided on the peep to help q10 and also to give me a set of 
forcing moves which would give white bad shape - as shown in my variation.]

(;W[pi]C[I didnt expect this.]
(;B[ni]C[my opponent mentioned that he didnt expect my o11, and expected p12 
instead. I felt that p12 would be a bad move due to w o11.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nj]C[I dont think my opponent seen this ladder.]
;B[mj];W[qj]
(;B[nk]C[should i have connected at q9 instead of capture at o9?

crazyd - difference seems small this early in the game, black is doing 
fine.];W[oh];B[qf]C[looking at this move and the sequence that followed i feel i should 
have played n12 and blocked white. I was trying to force.

crazyd - N12 seems like the bigger move];W[mh];B[qk]C[here i wanted to put pressure on the q6 group and try to split them 
from the r10 group

crazyd - you must have expected the cut at Q9.  Could you read that R9 is 
overplay?];W[pk];B[oj];W[rj];B[dl]C[i wanted to put pressure on the c6 group and felt i could leave p9 
where as it was, happy that i had created a potential moyo

crazyd - okay, but O6 area looks huge.];W[bq];B[dr];W[bk];B[cl]
C[trying to split c7 and b9

crazyd - how can they be split? [don't peep at a knight's move if you can't 
cut\]];W[bl];B[dm];W[cn];B[cg]C[i felt this was around the correct time to take c13

crazyd - looks good for black, but since C17 is still option for white, C14 
might be better.];W[mm];B[nm]C[i was hoping to try and push n7 into my wall, on hind sight perhaps 
p7 would have been better?

crazyd - you seem to have a bad habit of contacting isolated enemy stones 
and making them stronger];W[nn];B[mn]C[crazyd - did you think about P7, a double peep?]
;W[om];B[nl];W[mo];B[ln];W[no];B[mp];W[lo];B[km]TR[ni][oi][mj]
[oj][pj][nk][ok][nl][nm][ln][mn]C[i wasnt sure about 
this move, but i thought it would give good shape incase my n10 group fell 
into trouble later on.

crazyd - it's hard to pass up fourth line territory with M4 unless you 
thought N10 group would die [it shouldn't\]];W[lq];B[lp];W[kq]
;B[jq];W[kn];B[lm];W[kp];B[jn];W[ko];B[nr]C[I played o2 as i was worried that my corner was too open and i could 
lose it, with an invasion, i thought it would be better shape than a play at 
n3 or o3];W[qq]C[as i thought. I got a bit worried here];B[oo]
C[i played that for shape, and i was hoping it was a forcing move,]
;W[po]C[unfortunatly i was blind to q5];B[qp];W[mq];B[nq];W[jo]
;B[rq]C[i was still conserned about the corner at this point, so i played s3

crazyd - defending because you are nervous keeps you weak, like me.  The way 
to get strong is READ IT OUT and if it looks safe then don't defend.  If you 
are wrong you might lose some stones or even the game, but you will learn 
something and your reading ability and your game will get stronger.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[io];B[hq];W[hm];B[op]C[i felt this was a forcing move,

crazyd - but why play it now?  save for ko threat.];W[on];B[fc]
C[i felt closing the corner was the biggest point at this time.

crazyd - yes, looks very big];W[mc];B[nc]C[crazyd - again touching a potential target of attack [it is like 
getting into a fight and handing your opponent a strength potion]
;W[le];B[lc]TR[mb][md]C[not sure why i did that. I wanted to put pressure on n17, 
ive marked my other thoughts];W[md];B[ld]TR[mb]C[Triangle was the other move considered, but i felt m15 was 
stronger - threating the cut at n15];W[mf];B[ne]C[a forcing peep]
;W[me];B[lg]C[crazyd - bad, he gets to cut you instead of you cutting him.]
;W[mg]C[again a forcing peep - trying to add to my frame work]
;B[jf]C[the follow up i had in mind to m13];W[nd];B[oc]C[um, i was worried about my corner again and felt that i could give 
up the three stones. was this wrong?

crazyd - the FOUR stone capture is still small];W[oe];B[rh]
C[i wanted compensation for my three stones

crazyd - but N18 is big [think of white N18 with a monkey jump in either 
direction\]];W[qg];B[rg];W[qi];B[qh]C[crazyd - you saw that 4 stones was small but are now fighting over 
one stone?];W[mb]C[this is where i felt gutted that i hadn't played n18 myself]
;B[lb]C[the wrong direction perhaps? i felt the upper left was more open to 
invasion

crazyd - left is bigger and right is weaker, depends on your reading 
ability];W[pa];B[pb];W[oa];B[ob]C[crazyd - not good, this is common pattern [worth learning\]]
;W[na];B[od]C[i think that was foolish, i wanted to set up a multi-step ko, but 
should have played r19

crazyd - R19 doesn't work now.  You seem to have good sense of direction and 
strategy, but you fail to back it up tactically.  And later in this game you 
comment a couple places where you want to kill white groups.  "Wanting" 
isn't an issue if they can't be killed and READING TACTICS [best move 
sequences for both players\] will tell you which groups can be killed, both 
yours and your opponents.  You had good ideas, but did not read if they 
would work.  Play slow games where you imagine your opponent's best response 
to your imagined next play before you make it and see if you like the result 
FOR EVERY MOVE.  The next level is to have 3 or 4 options for each move 
which you compare the imagined best sequences.
