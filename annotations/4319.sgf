Enjoy :o)];B[qd];W[qp];B[dc];W[ce];B[cp];W[eq]C[janr: In this kind of opening, I usually find it difficult to decide what is the biggest point.]

(;B[do]C[Good move. Simple and effective. After this move black has pince on both left side and the bottom side. See variations.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc]C[janr: I know i have to jump.  However, the result seems only slightly worse than the joseki and afterwards the aji for complications seems much smaller.

Indeed this is not necessary. The principle is if we don't need to play on the third line, we better not.]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[cj]
(;B[oc]C[since black h17 is low, the upper side is less interesting. I think black should play at the bottom side, especially white e3 is still weak. After white got c10, normally we would like to attack e3.]
;W[qi]C[White got the bigger side, good game white.];B[np];W[pq]
C[Nice calm move. The problem for black now is black does not have a good move at the bottome side.]
;B[hq]C[this move attacks the white stone, but leaves a big hole at L4, but if black plays at k3 as joseki, white e3 will have enough space to live.]
;W[fp];B[dq]C[janr: The keima in the corner seems sente for white while settling the white group.  So I try to prevent it, but this results in a complicated fight with both sides having two weak groups running.

This is the only move. As you said white c2 is sente, that would be too easy for white. Actually I do feel white f4 is little bit heavy, I would invade at L4 directly.]
;W[kp];B[ho];W[fn];B[hm];W[fl]
(;B[mm]C[janr: I tried to read out a lot of variations to attach the white stone, but could find nothing better than trying to attack grom a distance.

You right, there is no way to attack white severely. sv];W[ip]
;B[hp];W[km]C[Now black has two groups to run.];B[kr]C[janr: Mr. Lazarev said this is maybe a bad move.  I played it with the intention of making at least one group strong, and then reduce the resulting white on the right.

I agree with him. In Chinese we say: two brothers should not fight for the same road. Because one is happy but the other one not. 

On go board, it is when two groups both need eyes, they should keep distance, don't fight for the same area for eyes, because one gets eye the other will be damaged. 

H9 would be still the best move in this situation.]
(;W[jr]C[I do not agree white this move. It helps black. sv]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[ir];W[lr];B[js];W[mq]C[Now black lived with one group, white lost sente. Black has time to escape with n7 stone.]
;B[pj]C[Very nice move.]
(;W[qj]C[Wrong direction. sv];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql]
(;B[em]C[janr: it seems up to now the game follows the plan, but maybe the plan is bad.  Now everyone is settled, black wants to erase the white territory on the left.

I like your idea very much. The game is good for black now. white has about 20 points on the right side, if black gets out from the left side, white has almost nothing left around this area. black has 10 in upper left, more than 10 in upper right, 10 in lower left and plus a few at the bottome. So if black breaks through from here, the game would be very good for black.

But I do not agree with this move.];W[gn]C[Good move. Follow up at h6 will solve all the problems for white. And black has no time to defend at h6.]

;B[dh];W[ei];B[eh];W[hn]C[janr: I entered  this record after the game.  I'm not completely sure of the order of moves (upper left vs center bottom)

Black destroyed white territory, but the price is quite high. Upper left corner is been damaged and h7 stone is been cut off. Plus black group is not alive yet.]
;B[jp]
(;W[io]C[feels too early. sv];B[jo];W[in];B[ko];W[mp];B[ln]
C[So black is safe here.];W[bf]C[huge.];B[bg];W[ae];B[hh];W[cc]
;B[ic]C[White is little bit ahead now. 

The fighting from black e7 did not give black much, actually white still has his points and black becomes weaker.]

;B[om];W[pn];B[qg]C[Good move.];W[er];B[dr];W[on]C[Painful for black. After this move white has more than 30 points around this area.]
;B[nl];W[pi]C[Lazarev is very good in this kind of situation. Very solid and good end game.]
;B[oi];W[je];B[jm]C[Making the center is not the best. I would play  at L15.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[jl];B[im];W[hl];B[kl];W[il];B[lm]TR[hl][il][jl]
C[Black did not gain enough, lost sente and with the marked white stones the black group on left side does not look so happy.]
;W[kd];B[kc]C[janr: I considered the cut, sacrificing three stones in the upper left, but it looked too dangerous.  

You are right, it is too dangerous.];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[nc]

(;W[mo]C[Huge. White has at least 42 points here!

Black does not have enough anymore.

C[I finally lost the game with about 13 points.

Black lost too much from the fight, starting with move 45. It looked like black distroyed white territory, but white gained very much in upper left corner, black stones there becomes weak and almost no points after white 78. And with move 50 the black lower left corner is much smaller, white also cut 25 off. 

In the begining because of move 15 little problem with direction, black had trouble at the bottom side. White gave black chance by playing at 32 which makes very easy for black, white lost sente too.]
)
(;W[jj]C[I would jump out first, this move attack the group too, black can't take sente.]
))
(;W[gc];B[gb];W[cc];B[ib];W[bf];B[bg];W[ae]C[I may choose this way. White is safe and gains many points, at the same time keeps black weak. There is a risk that black group at the right side will be in danger too because black has two groups again.]
))
(;W[di]C[looks good enough. White just needs to connect from the left side or pushes through at h6.]
))
(;B[dk]C[I would directly walk out. The black corner is strong enough that we do not need to worry if white walk in between.]
;W[dm];B[ck]C[White will suffer much more this way.]))
(;W[pi]C[I would push from this direction, to keep the black group weak.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[rk]))
(;W[lq]C[I would just cut black into two pieces. The black shape is not really safe, white has j2 for example.

This would be much harder for black.]))
(;B[hk]C[I would just jump out, this move helps black group a lot. Normally with suchy groups we should run to the center very fast. And it is very painful for white too. white position at the left side is been reduced. Moreover black has a severe follow up at d9.

In the lower right corner, if you look closely you would find out white does not have severe attack either. 

Therefore we don't need to hurry at all. This is also the reason I think white f4 is a bit too heavy.]
))
(;B[hq]C[for example this kind of moves.];W[oq];B[qk]C[just let white play the upper side.]
))
(;B[gp]C[This is another way. Black makes his position higher on the left side before pincer white c15.]
;W[eo];B[dn]
(;W[ip];B[gn];W[gq]C[Up to here is a joseki.];B[cg]LB[do:A]
C[Now black has high position to pincer the white c15 stone. If black pince the white stone without the variation in the lower left corner, white has A to press black down.]
)
(;W[dl]C[Of course then white has this kind of resistance.]
;B[en];W[fo];B[fm];W[cq];B[bq];W[dp];B[co];W[cr];B[di]C[This will lead to a more complicated game.]
