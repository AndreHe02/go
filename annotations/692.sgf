AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello Reviewer!
Thanks for taking the time to look at my game.  I play black and am ranked 21 kyu on KGS.

I was very unhappy with my opening and endgame play in this game.  I lost by 8.5 points that could have been easily made up in the endgame but for a few wasted moves.  I also have some life and death questions at various points.  I appreciate any help you can give me!  Thanks!

Well there are a number of big mistakes which swing the game both ways, which is what makes it fun. As you gain experience you'll see the mistakes and avoid them so not to worry about those.

I think you might work on a couple of general ideas to good effect;

a)  Don't think so aggressively about attacking and killing. Your questions were often of this nature. Be  more placid and consider that its about sharing. Usually with a sequence of moves Black gets one thing White will get something else. If Black gets something worth a little more from each "sharing" Black will accumulate enough to win.

b) Think more about the whole board and look for the biggest move. (One of my weaknesses ) Responding to a sequence started by your opponent means they are controling the game.  Think more about sente. If your opponent is forced to reply to your move you get another go!

c) Its good that  you remember you've been told a move achieves something - but when studying its better to have worked out / understood why.  As you found in this game your opponent may play the move anyway.]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[d: My first mistake?  Looking back, would K4 or Q10 been a better strategy?  i.e. build on my strength versus attack early?  I'm not used to playing with a handicap lately.

J:  Not a mistake. I might tend to play something like Q10 to expand my area of influence and wait for White to approach me - but that is purely a personal preference. I don't see that your move is wrong in any way.   By the way I'm not sure you should be thinking of F17 as an "attack". Black is approaching a corner where White has a spehere of influence because of playing first. It's not an "attack" since White can happily play elsewhere without this stone  being in any danger.]
;W[df]
(;B[ee]C[d: Another mistake?  I was hoping for W d15, and then I was going to jump out to K16.  I think B f15 or B f18 would have been better here.

J: Well you've learnt that your opponent may not do what you want but will do what's best for them.

Secondly would your plan have been a good one anyway? See variations to white's move]

(;W[ed]
(;B[fe]C[J: The fact that you have poor choices in response to white pushing confirms that E15 was a mistake.

I think this move was also a mistake. black gets left with all sorts of cutting points but luckily white doesn't take full advantage.

I would make the best of a bad job and try to sacrifice 1 stone - see if I could salvage something.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[ge]C[J: Again Black would rather have blocked the move before.

Now do you stand to lose 2 stones instead of 1
There's a cut at G17 instead on 2 stones connected together]
;B[fg];W[de];B[eg]
(;W[he];B[hd];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[jc];W[ig]C[d: I felt lucky here, because I thought white could have punished me much worse, but I still felt very vulnerable.

J: Yes Black was let off. However its not as vulnerable as it was a few moves ago. I think black gained a little over the sequence.

The top is relatively OK and there are ways for the bamboo joint to escape by running. White has created a group inbetween Black groups which might become vulnerable to attack in the future.]

(;B[kd]TR[jf]C[J: My thinking at this point would go a bit like this.

I would first note that K14 seems an important point in White's shape. If Black gets that and runs away safely White hasn't any eyes.

This interests me because if White is running Black might get to play stones around F/G 10/11. IF that happens D13 or C12 suddenly gives Black a nice shape on the side. Black's weak stones  become useful.

On the other hand L16 is OK in itself. Its a nice shape when combined with the marked point, gets onto the 4th rank and hanes at the head of 2 stones. The trouble is it invites White to strengthen this group. I'd prefer to avoid this because the 4 black stones are suddenly stuck next to a strong corner under the shadow of a strong group. They will have to run away or die.

So if I "attack" the white group from the top I might be forcing my own group into bigger danger. Therefore at some stage I'll have to stop and think about defending it.

Where would all this thinking get me? Well I might play as in the game - but thinking I was defending  and making the top solid before I defend the side.

Or I might simply defend the side straight away with F10];W[ke]

(;B[je]C[d: Hoping to gain (a tiny bit of) ground towards the center.  It worked as planned, though it was in gote and didn't actually gain me much.  Would a simple B m16 have been better?]
;W[ie];B[le];W[kf];B[lc];W[dg];B[fj]C[d: What's the best move to escape here?

J; I think this is OK];W[dj];B[el];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[d: I am told this play prevents C3 invasion, but...

J: nobody told white :)]
(;W[cq]C[d: ...white is bold.];B[dq]C[j: Good];W[cp];B[co];W[dr]
;B[er];W[br]C[d: Now, how to respond to this to kill white?]
;B[ds];W[cr]
(;B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[eq]C[d: ouch... at this point I was very frustrated with myself.. :)]
;B[pj];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[d: after being burned in the lower left, I tried something that felt safer.]
;W[np];B[jp]C[d: This has got to be a bad move.  I think I was worried about white getting the bottom, but I should have been worried more about the left and the corner.

j: Well the standard moves would be Black Q6 and White extending to K4 which does give white a lot. Taking White's move away is often a good idea. But you have to accept that since Black has not extended on the side White will have opportunities to cause trouble by playing there.   By playing K4 you are accepting a fight in the corner.]
;W[rp]C[d: white is playing moves I never expected.]
(;B[qq]C[d: saving the corner... should I have saved the left instead?  It's probably bigger.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[qn]
(;B[po]C[d: not good, I'm guessing.

j: Well black's taken a small corner which isn't alive yet.  Getting out into the centre and keeping White separated is good so I'd not be too critical of this move but i think Q6 would be better]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ok]C[j: yes generally good thing to do when you get the chance]
;W[pn];B[mq]C[d: now my stone at K4 felt weak.

j: Well its out on its own but this stone becomes something white threatens so it has to time to help K4 out.

I'd prefer something around N5. This is aiming to develop a central moyo as well]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[nr];B[mr]C[d: I'm not sure why I played this.  Looking at it now, it looks like a very bad move.  Maybe I was trying to ensure life on the bottom.

j: it looks horrible shape and it doesn't achieve much.   White is aiming to kill the corner, or link this group to the live one on the side.  Both are bad for Black.

R1 is a good point for living. P5 is a bad shape but looks to keeping the White group from connecting to the live side. (It also lets Black poke a nose out towards the centre)]

(;W[mm];B[mk];W[oo];B[or]C[d: was I right that this was necessary to live?

j: I think so];W[lf];B[me];W[rd]C[d: another approach I never expected.  At least I learned some new moves in this game... if I knew how to use them!

j: White has a number of ways to jump inside the 4-4 point so Black should expect something. For example the 3-3 invasion would also take the corner away from you.

If you want to think of the corner as territory you need to reinforce before this happens. It is usually a matter of timing. White has jumped in just in time. A black move at, say R15 or R16 would have been big.

With S16 White is giving Black a choice. In general you can let White live in the corner or  you can protect the corner and let white move out down the side.

I've shown a variety of possible sequences, some better than others]

(;B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pb]C[d: not so good of a result for black... could I have done better?]
;W[qg];B[rh];W[rg]LB[cc:D][rk:B][rm:C][hr:A]C[j: Black always has the option of looking at the whole board and deciding there's something more worthwhile somewhere else. Black is secure at the top so there may be many moves better than trying to kill this shape.

A lives oat the bottom
B and C hit weak points in White's shape
D may even be possible, fun to check it out]
(;B[qe]CR[nf][ng][oh]C[d: as you can tell, I was unsure about how to approach this shape...

j: The shape does not have 2 eyes yet.

To kill it you have to achieve 2 things. Firstly you have to stop it connecting to anything alive. Secondly you will probably have to build up a 3,4 or 5 stone single eye shape inside it.

Compare to your bottom corner. Its alive but cut off with very few points.  White got more than you on the outside. Therefore I'd start by thinking about cutting it off.

Imagine you attack this shape but it lives however you get stones where I've marked. Do you think this will help you pressure the white group in the top middle - or connect your side group to the living top?]

;W[oi];B[oj];W[nh];B[mi];W[mg];B[jj]TR[mm][fq]C[This next sequence gave me enough of the middle to stay close, thankfully.]
;W[ep];B[do];W[ho];B[jn];W[kl];B[il];W[fn];B[gm]LB[eb:B][cl:A]
[iq:C]C[j: All the marked points seem good moves for white. Correspondingly black should be thinking about them, or their equivalent. There's not that much to be gained in the middle compared to what can be had around the edges.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[ml];B[kk];W[ll];B[nk]TR[ck][rm][hr]C[d: a weak point at K9 that will haunt me later.

j: As mentioned earlier there are all sorts of big moves both players are missing. Suggestions for black are

H2 - sente for Black and secures a lot on the bottom
S7 - followed by S9 eats a lot of what white probably imagines is territory
C9 - fairly simple but taking a bit on the side];W[iq]C[j: white plays it first. See what a differences it makes, wouldn't you like to have played in this area first?]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[kr]C[d: ouch, this fallback hurt at the time.]
;W[ir];B[hp]C[j: Unless you're sure this sort of thing works simple moves like C9 are better. The game sequence lost 1 stone and solidified white's position]
;W[ip];B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[hn]C[d: not white's best move, perhaps?  I expected G5 or H3.]

(;B[gr]C[j: again this is a wasted move];W[gn]C[d: this move surprised me... but maybe I shouldn't have been.]
;B[hq]C[d: I didn't think I could connect to the E2 group and still kill the J3 group and/or live at G2.  I still don't think I could have.]

(;W[fr]C[j: white could do better, see variation];B[hr];W[gs]
;B[is];W[fs];B[fo]C[too late for this, I think, but it saved a few points, I guess.

j: Black gained out of the exchanges in this area but its still better to play the big points around the edges elsewhere.

Read your comment two moves on. The worries you consider there would not be so strong if this move had not forced white to strengthen here]

j: Yes. See comments in your variations.];W[ch];B[eh]
(;W[hm];B[hl];W[jk]C[d: here's my weak point...

j: Well not really. Black doesn't really have much left in the centre. So long as everything lives this isn't that much damage.   White could still have done damage with H11 if  this "weak point" was not there]
;B[kj];W[jl];B[jm]C[d: J9 is better here... or J10 even.  not sure why I picked K7... if I was trying to cut the two white groups, I didn't need it yet.

j: i'm not sure why  you play this move. Black's group is alive on the bottom. The danger is more to the group above, or on the right side. Yes the alternatives were better]

;B[kq]CR[kq]C[j: for example])))
(;B[eq]TR[fj][el][dn][co][dp][dq][eq][er]C[J: simply connecting seems correct

J: When  there is a 3-3 invasion its usual to give up the corner. You give up a small life but gain a strong outside wall.

Here Black need not be thinking so much about killing the corner - look at the lovely wall. Those stones originally played simpy running away at the top suddenly make a huge wall and potential framework. The wall has good potential for making eyes for itself so its pretty much safe.

So if  White tries and live with the F3 stone Black plays on the right  but does NOT try to kill. Black aims to push White towards the strong wall. While White lives Black builds up strength along the right side, and perhaps a little territory on the bottom.

As a result White moves are struggles to live but Black simply switches his strength from the bottom to the side.   Thats the game plan. As for specific moves it depends on how White plays next.

Firstly - is White alive in the corner?]

My feel is that A and B are too close. E is perhaps leaving White too much room so I'd choose  C or D. They threaten a bigger framework so White is under more pressure to do something about it.

OK it leaves white room for a 2 space jump but since one stone is touching the black wall I feel white's got lots of trouble getting this stone out to safety.   I think I'd pick C. The reason is I want to be sure White cannot live on the bottom but has to run away. Its along run because of the big wall so Black can hope for a large bottom corner. Also during the chase Black might get to play somewhere like J10. This has the bonus of putting a little more pressure on White's top group - a chance to kill it might even emerge.

I'll illustrate the sort of thing I mean but don't assume these moves are always  "the best"]

The white cutting stone at G15 is not dead yet and is also a problem for Black.]
;B[he]CR[he]C[J: White can take sente to start operations in another part of the board or keep on expanding along the top.

H13 would even threaten to help the stone escape splitting Black into 2 groups so its probably sente. Therefore White could support it and nullify any outside strength Black has. This means black got nothing from the corner at all]

;W[fg]CR[fg];B[hd]CR[hd]C[J:

OK White has gained some territory which can expand nicely since it is so high.

Black has a good shape and is developing nicely on the top. The wall works well with the Q16 stone]

(;W[de]CR[de];B[jd]CR[jd]C[J:   Firstly - If you wanted K16 you could just play it straight away.  (See next move comment)   So what did  E15 gain you? The black stone is stuck against a white wall and more likely to be threatened than to cause White to worry in any way. It is a bad exchange for  white having played D15 and got this nice wall.

Black would now much prefer to see E15 at F15];AE[ee]LB[cj:A]
[pj:B][jp:C]C[Suppose that White plays D15 in response to K16.

Black has all sorts of good options.

A limits the growth of white's area and threatens to cut it out underneath.
B and C expant black's sphere of influence nicely.

All these look nice for Black yes? White plays 3 stones in one small corner while black is playing all over the board.  Therefore Blac]
