C[A no-komi game played on KGS (post-rank adjustments).  I was black.

I felt that  the opening lost me this game, as I felt as though I was  doing better than my opponent during the later stages.  Most likely, the catastrophe in the upper right corner was my biggest mistake, but I would  like to get  the opinion of a stronger  player.

I am particularly interested in general comments about my playing.  I do not currently know where my weaknesses are, and I'd like to know what to work on.

Thanks in advance!

u: Hi, i'm unstable from kgs. I had fun reviewing this game.

Several things you need to practice. Among them:

- Know when to fight and when to back down from a fight.
- What's big in the beginning.

 Let me know if you have any questions.];B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]
;B[oc];W[cf]LB[qj:A]C[This is fine; however when black makes a corner enclosure, the area around A is very urgent.]
;B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[di]LB[ch:A]C[This is a bad shape. It has weakness at A. This is the reason why C11 is normal. If white had a wall around c6, then w can consider D12. But D11 is rarely played.]
;B[fq]LB[hc:A]TR[fd]C[The weakness of triangled stone is A. For this reason, black around K17 is very big. It's hard for me to judge, but I think it's preferable to F3. Also R10 is very urgent. That extension from the corner enclosure is similar in value to playing first in the corner.]
;W[cm];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[l]
(;W[oe]C[This is usually played as a reduction if black has some stones say at r10. In this case, there is nothing to reduce. So just a simple approach at r10 is more usual. See variation.]

(;B[kd]C[This one is alittle far from p15. See variations.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nb]C[This is too submissive. See variants. The point is, you have alot of soldiers around, so it's embarassing to croll like this! When you have strength around, then cut and kill something.]
;W[ob];B[mb]C[Simply playing Q18 seems best to me now... I don't know what I was thinking.  The result is terrible for black, I think.

u: I agree.];W[pc];B[od];W[pd];B[nd];W[ne];B[md];W[qe];B[pb]
;W[qb];B[oa];W[qc];B[pn]C[I had to interfere with the development of the right side, I felt...]
;W[ql]C[u: I'd prefer a calm move like p4. After upper corner disaster, white is comfortably ahead. So no need to complicate things.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[pi];B[ck]C[I feel I am behind, so I am trying to play actively.

u: s6 is your sente. You should do that first. But c9 is not bad. White's shape has weakness at c12.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[ej];W[cl];B[ci];W[bk];B[dh];W[ic];B[he]
C[This is half-measures. Simply e11 is best. Most importantly, it prevents connection at b11 and almost kills c14 in a single blow! Black would have been back in the game...]
