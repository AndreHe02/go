AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello, I'm ZNemesis, taking black on IGS. I'm a fairly new player. I'm looking to understand what my strength is, and wondering what would be an appropiate kyu rank for myself would be.

White is a friendly player who helped me learn along the way. Some of the game time was spent talking, but I was still under a lot of time pressure trying to think my way through moves.

I'd really like advice on what moves are appropiate near the start of the game.

Hello, I'm Gregor. I'll try to be of help. thank your for letting me review your Game!]

(;B[dm]TR[pd]C[In a non-handicap game, I know it is usually best no to play near your opponents first move, instead playing a "big" move

In a handicap game, I always wonder wheter I should defend the stone just attacked (triangle) or just make a big move
Gregor: I thint to play tenuki (elswere) is possible. I'd prefere ot play it on the 3rd line - at c7, but perhaps c6 is even better.
To defend in teh upper rigth corner see vaiants:];W[pf]C[Gregor: now the b stone is in difficulties! Here ot ply in the corne seems very impurtant for me. for example:]

A difference of 56 points.

To me, the only very major blunder I made was allowing the Q3 group to die, which cost me about 14 points which is still a large victory by white.

How many points did moves 74 & 80 cost me? Where else did I go wrong?

Gregor: To loose a corner one has already is heavy indeed. I connot say, what the moves 74 & 80 are worth. but I tried to give some hints.
If you look at your terrytory, you see, that b hasn'got any on the left side - but played in the beginning there - too high. you should concetrate on the corners first, then extend to the sides and go to the center from a secure basis.

I hope, my hints are of some help. thank you again for letting me review your game.
greetings and good luck!])
