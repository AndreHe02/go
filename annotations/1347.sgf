C[ferter [18k\]: hi
Malachar [19k\]: hi];B[pd]C[all undo's and chat have been removed , the undos were black trying to stop my attack in the top right (the seki) i was nice and let him keep undoing till he got it into just a seki instead of a right off kill for me :D

im white, and im about 19-20k ? (i think the reason kgs says im 18k is because of the bug (sort of a bug) that makes your rank rise if you dont play for a while.
*continued next on pg 2* <-- lol kgs client does not let you write very much on a pg]
;W[dc]C[i cant wait to find out if what i thought was true or if its not ... well the enlightenment will be just as pleasing :)
ive included the moves i really have problems with..., please tell tell me about any other really bad moves :P
kind regrads - Jonathan Bartlett];B[pq]C[hi Jonathan,

nice to meet you. yes, some go server encounter this kind of bugs :) maybe you can try those server that rise your rank according to your results and number of games you've played and record your mark accordingly. Sorry, i've digress a bit :p
i'll try my best to help you, but i have to tell that i also make mistakes. Please correct me if i'm wrong and do not hesitate to discuss with me.i like discussion and welcome critical comments. Have fun!

[eq]C[this joseki did not gain me much and im not sure if D6 was the best move available to me. could i have extended further, say to d8 or c8?

what i think is you can play at d7 if you want. you can also play at d8, at this time, you still can't differentiate who is in better situation. but c8 too low, as you had play 3 stones at second line, you should not be too repeating.]

;B[ci];W[ck];B[ei]C[i kind of like this branch off more *see branch off :P* because it gives me more centre strength. and my orginal play had too many bad plays in them (i was trying to to do some inside moves which i have seen better players play and have had played against me) if you could give an idea of a good way to attack... ?]

(;W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[dh];W[bg];B[bi]C[i don't know i'm correct or not, there are some possible outcomes that i've think of, for white next move, please see the variation below]

(;W[cf];B[bf];W[cg]C[32 is wasted. playing here does not stop black from capturing your white stones inside.]
;B[be];W[dj];B[di];W[bj]C[white 36 should play at E14 first, although this pass the initiative to black, but to play safe and avoid more attacks from black, you should consider here first.]
;B[ef]LB[fe:a][fg:b]CR[fh]TR[gh]MA[pq]C[black breaks through.now he has 2 sides to play, see the two marked point on the board.if balck play at point 'b', white would not be saved by playing at 'red dot' as black can capture white easily by playing at 'marked triangle' point, and moreover, black stone at Q3 helps in capturing white. please check it slowly.]

;B[mq];W[oo]C[i think i should of played r8 not p5 because p5 gains me no territory...
any other moves which would serve the same purpose as r8(making room to live).
or should i have played a more forcefull move that would mean he has to reply then play the r8 move?

What i'm thinking is play at R3 now can let you make room to live.as you invade the corner, black must reply you. then you cound extend your room of living in next few moves.]

as in the variation before this. actually you don't need to end up with ko.]

was black jumping at ghosts.. or was there a threat here ?]

Black leads by 10.5 points. actually you can play better in this game if you reply correctly and try to minimize mistakes, and of course, count every move you and your opponent play, and decide which is the better solution for the problem you encounter. Again, if you find that i'm wrong in anywhere, please tell me, as i'm also learn as i play or review games. Wish you improve more in this brand new year :) cheers!]
