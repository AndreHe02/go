C[Hi, this is a close game. I lost by 3.5 moku. I think i am not very good at joseki (or maybe fuseki). I am not very sure what's the difference yet  :)]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[Ah, one more thing, I seldom play white, that's why I am not very sure where I should put my stones in the beginning of the game.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[pj]C[I am not sure how to respond to my opponent's move, because I seldom face an opponent who uses defensive move such as this.]
;W[fc]C[Since my opponent is using defensive move, so i thought that maybe I need to strengthen my teritory too.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]C[I am not sure how I should respond to black's movement at D2. Should I defend the corner? or play somewhere else?]
;W[kq];B[nq];W[mr];B[or];W[cq]C[I was scared that the whole corner will be taken by black, so I played at C3

BramGo: C3 is a big move indeed. you secure the corner, but more important : the black group remains unsettled. Now it looks like black has no choice but adding another stone.]
;B[ic]C[BramGo: Black did not add a move at the bottum; you could add several forcing moves now, and try building thickness while playing them... see variation for an example (not joseki, just something that looks ok to me)]

(;W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]C[This is a wrong movement i guess? I think I should placed my stone at R18 first?

BramGo: This move is fine. It is the most natural move to play. Normally black will continue as seen in the variation.]

(;B[qb];W[rb];B[ob];W[qe];B[oe]LB[pg:A][ph:C][qh:B]C[BramGo: instead of Q15, one of these moves looks better imho. Q15 was a bit slow.]

(;W[qh];B[qm];W[dj];B[ed];W[ec];B[cf];W[de]C[Do you think D16 is better than D15? or is there a better move?]

;B[ad]
(;W[cg]C[Do you think that I would do better if I had move at D14 instead of C13?

BramGo: the situation looks pretty safe for me. There is a bit of aji though. But I would tenuki and attack the bottum left group (see variation).]
;B[df];W[fe];B[ef];W[dg];B[ip];W[iq];B[jr];W[jq];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[mq];W[gr];B[cl]C[BramGo: this black move is very agressive ... the best way to play this is split up the f5 and c8 stone. This makes it easy to attack both sides. So ... D8 looks fine to me.]
;W[bn]C[Initially I wanted to place my stone at D8. But I was afraid that black might be able to survive and find its way to the center, so I placed my stone at B6 instead.]
;B[co];W[cn];B[do];W[eo];B[ep];W[en];B[dq];W[cp];B[cr];W[el]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[bo];B[hp];W[bj]C[BramGo: this looks a bit paranoid. This move in the center and you have a bigger chance to win this game ...]
;B[jj]LB[if:A][oh:C][kp:B]C[At this point, I was kind of terrified by black's movement in the center. I really had no idea where I should move next. It seemed to me that black has took most part of the center board.

BramGo: The score is about even. But at first sight i would say black is at an advantage ... he can easely make additional points with a move like A B or C. Before making a move here it is worth reading this out. And keep in mind that it is better to make light shapes here, do not play too defensive.]

(;W[il]LB[ie:C][jl:A][km:B]C[Didn't want to give the center board to black, so I tried to place my stone as near to the center as possible.

But I think that my movement is not very good.

BramGo: It is very hard to find the right move here ... But maybe a move at A or B is better ... the problem is that k14 is probably enough to get black ahead in points, and A or B will not really help you to score points yourself in that case ... So maybe C is not a bad idea after all.]
;B[eg]
(;W[eh]LB[gg:A]C[Bramgo: wrong side imho. I would have played wG13(A) without thinking.]
;B[fh];W[ei];B[gl];W[ko];B[lm];W[km];B[jl]C[BramGo : no good move for black ... contradicts m7]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[jn];B[in]
(;W[jo]C[I thought of placing my stone at J7, but I am not very confident, so I defend at K5 instead.

BramGo: This move is too heavy and has no function actually ... (see variation) maybe a good moment to switch sides and play g14 and j15.]

Its quite an important spot isn't it?

BramGo: Thank you for letting me review it.
during the game you played a lot of good moves. The most important advice I can give you is to pay a bit more attention to weak groups of your enemy that are not prepared to live locally. And then try to attack them in a way that gives you an advantage in points.]
