C[[Zef\] I don't know what to think about my game start (before stone 40). If you could give me some "alternate" moves in this part.  I also added some questions in the SGF file. Thanks a lot

[dwheeler\] Hello, I hope my review is helpful. If you have any questions, you are welcome to email me

I'm sure my thoughts and suggestions may not be the best, and other players of my own strength or stronger might disagree or have better suggestions, but hopefully there will be something I've said that will help you keep progressing to the next level.

You had a good game with a strong opening. Playing on 4-4 is more of an influence/moyo game than a territory game. But then playing in opposite corners will be more of a fighting game. I'm not so sure that these two different strategies work well together.

Overall, I think you had trouble using your influence to create territory, and then allowed white too easily to secure his territory. (I often have the same problem myself)

Some things to work on:
 1) watch for wasted moves. Ask youself what happens if I play somewhere else first? Will I have time to then come back and protect? Or do I even need to protect at all? Can I safely tenuki?
 2) be careful not to push your opponent the wrong direction, and try not to sacrifice your stones too early. Its good that you're not afraid to sacrifice them, but be sure to make full use of them first to make trouble elsewhere.]

TR[qp][oq]C[[dwheeler\] look at the direction of white's two stones. They want to extend up along the right side. So its bigger if you take that point first instead of the lower side.]
;W[pk]
(;B[gc]LB[fc:A][ci:B]C[[dwheeler\] Too far away really (which makes you later corner invasion awkward.

B would have been good also. Works well with your other stones.]
;W[ef]
(;B[dj]LB[dh:A]C[[dwheeler\] too far away, invites white to invade there]
;W[jd]
(;B[cc]LB[ge:A]C[C: Was it a good choice ?

[dwheeler\] I would have jumped out at A myself. Your G17 stone is too far away to support this invasion. With this move, you're saying that you want the corner (one side or the other), and in return giving white more outside influence

Jumpping out instead, you keep the pressure on white by separating his groups.]

(;W[cd]C[[dwheeler\] I think white went to the wrong side here]
;B[dc]
(;W[ge]LB[ed:A]C[[dwheeler\] this is a mistake by white. White should have finished this joseki, so...]

(;B[mc]LB[ed:A]TR[ge]C[[dwheeler\]... I think you could have punished white for this mistake]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[bd]
(;B[db]LB[ec:A][dh:B]C[[dwheeler\] I don't think this move was necessary]
;W[ch];B[bi]LB[qi:B][dm:A][mq:C]C[[dwheeler\] I think this helps white do what he already wanted to do anyway in sente. Black at A would be good. B and C are also big moves.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[dh];B[rf]LB[qd:B][qe:A][qi:C]C[C: it seemed me to shy, but hope prevent invasion by this way ... good choice ?

[dwheeler\] playing on the second line is not the best (especially this early in the game). Black at A or B would be good and would help prevent an invasion in the corner. C is also big.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[ph]
(;B[qg]LB[og:A]C[[dwheeler\] myself, I'd be tempted to go the other way]
;W[le];B[me]LB[jb:A][ng:B][rh:E][dm:C][mq:D]C[[dwheeler\] Attaching to white's stone helps white become stronger here.  A might have been better, threatening to link up your two groups.

maybe a one space jump toward the center at B. Or a big move at C giving you "cash in the bank" (lots of territory)]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[md]C[C: Here, I choosed sacrifying N15 and O14 (if necessary),
to take territory in center ...
I was afraid by a White stone around ~ J9 creating a big W moyo

no idea if it was silly

[dwheeler\] I like your idea. but probably not necessary to sacrifice them yet.

If you're afraid White is going to make a big moyo with J9, then just tenuki and take it first yourself.]
;B[mg];W[ne];B[mj];W[lg]TR[of][ng][mh]C[[dwheeler\] don't forget to keep counting your liberties]

(;B[mh]LB[ng:A][og:B]C[[dwheeler\] black at A or B would have been much stronger]
;W[ng];B[of];W[oh];B[od]LB[nc:A][ji:B]TR[mc]SQ[pd]C[[dwheeler\] strengthened the wrong stone. The N17 stone is the weak stone.

Black at B would be good now -- remember your earlier concerns about a large center moyo? Pick a plan and stick with it.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr]LB[gq:A]C[[dwheeler\] extending one more would be best, because it helps eliminate cutting points]
;W[bp];B[bo]TR[co][ep][gq]C[[dwheeler\] move 53 played one line higher would have helped eliminate these cutting points]
;W[br];B[cn];W[ap]
(;B[ao]C[[dwheeler\] Black passes his turn :)
(sorry, I mean that move was unnecessary - see variation)];W[nl]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[mn]LB[ji:A]TR[ml][mm]C[[dwheeler\] this stone is already weak, don't leave room for more weaknesses

you should move out into the center instead];W[mm]
(;B[fo]TR[ml][mn]C[[dwheeler\] where are you going? now you left two weak stones (not to mention an entire weak group).]
;W[ll];B[jl]LB[li:A][kj:B][qn:C]TR[mg][mh][mj][ml]C[[dwheeler\] now you are forcing white to capture your 4 stones. No need to sacrifice them yet, nor can you afford to let white have such a huge corner/side. I think this is where you lose the game.]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[kj];B[jj];W[ki];B[ih];W[kg];B[ji];W[kh];B[qc]
LB[lc:C][fh:A][rh:D][qn:B][mq:E]C[C: Maybe good time to play tenuki and prevent hoshi invasion ?

[dwheeler\] perhaps you're right :)
but white is ahead now, so he has need for a corner invasion. In that case you have time to invade white instead of defending your corner.]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[ko];B[jo];W[lq];B[kq];W[lp];B[jr];W[fi]C[C: I knew that I needed a play at ~ F12 before W played here but ... to late

After F11 could I hope surrounding this stone and take this territory ? (F12 G12 ...)
I prefered not allow W to enter my territory and play in defense.

I don't know if one or two stones can create quickly a threat in this kind of shape.

[dwheeler\] your next move was probably the best considering the circumstanses. But you could consider a trade - if white invades you, then you invade white. might work, might not. But you're behind now, so you need to take a few chances]

(;B[oe]LB[ob:A]C[[dwheeler\] ... that move wasn't necessary. Still need to prevent white from coming into your corner.]

maybe in pure Tsumego was I dead ?

I was confident because of G17, but maybe a better player could have taken this group without using to much stones ...

[dwheeler\] I don't know, I suck at tsumego. It looks to me like its safe for now. Black at A would sure help it alot, plus its sente as it threatens to capture the white stone. But you are so far behind now, its probably a good place to resign.]
