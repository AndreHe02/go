C[I'm white, I lost by 4,5 moku.

I don't have any questions about single moves, but I'd like to have some comment on the direction of my play, and which moves were bad.

Thank you in advance.];B[pd];W[co];B[pp];W[ec];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[ch];W[kc]C[Let's take stock of the position.

White has a nice position on the upper side, which he hopes to expand and consolidate in the future.

In exchange, Black has a secure territorial position in the upper left.]
;B[dq];W[fp];B[do];W[dn]C[Going in the wrong direction -- trying to develop close to a strong opposing force (Black's secure group above).  Thus White is tilting the balance in the upper left in favor of Black.

In the exchange, Black develops on the lower side, which expands the influence of his star-point stone to the right..]

;W[oi];B[ng];W[qi];B[lb]TW[pf][pg][oh][ph][qh][pi]C[White captured 6 black stones, with sente.  A major victory!

Who is winning the war?

White has about 50-55 points (the door at L18 is open).
Black has about 50-55 points.

Territory is about even.  But white's weak groups give black much more potential for further territory.]

(;W[cc]C[This looks a bit odd.

In the result through move 96, black gains moch more
territory in the corner than White gets in the center
and left side.];B[dd];W[ed];B[dc];W[cf];B[bf];W[db];B[bd];W[dh]
