Hi, my name is Fagner Fernandes and i'm your reviewer for this game.

I'll try to clarify all your doubts here and give you some tips during the game.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[id]C[This is a classical joseki. I don't know the name (because my memory is really bad) but I recognize the shape.

First, I need see what your opponent is trying to do. After J16, you can see that he wants to secure his base in upper side of the goban. You can respond...]

(;W[pj];B[dj];W[jp]C[Good. Now everything is quite well distributed.]
;B[cn]C[Hmm... Yo can see that he wants a piece of your territory in the corner, so you should defend.]

(;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[en];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn]C[Hmm... Quite well played here.]
;B[gm];W[hn]C[But you're concentrating too much your game.

See that he's build a HUGE territory in the right side. This is called moyo (what means 'potential territory').]
;B[hm]C[Now you can change the focus tring to reduce his territory.]

(;W[im];B[eo]C[Hmmm... i think you were a bit afraid here. you can play in]

(;W[eq];B[fp];W[ep];B[go];W[gp];B[ho]C[Remember this: sometimes you should lose the tail in order to save the body.

If you try to capture F4, you'll lose stones in F6.];W[fo];B[in]

(;W[io];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip]C[mmzzcc2 [30k\]: can we review at the end?]
;W[iq];B[jo]C[mmzzcc2 [30k\]: u fight very well....can u teach me?]

(;W[qn]C[This is too defensive. You have already lost too much territory.

Now it's time to fight!! I know that can be difficult if you don't know how and where to start.

i'll show you one possibillity. You should study more about fuseki and live and death. you can to this in www.goproblems.com]
;B[qf];W[mq];B[nc];W[ec];B[dc]C[You can spread one space further.]

(;W[gc];B[db];W[ee];B[cf];W[eg];B[kp]C[Thi is a force move. I must answer there.]

(;W[qh];B[jq]
(;W[ir]C[You're telling him to cut apart your groups. Stay calm and connected.]
;B[ib]C[mmzzcc2 [30k\]: no undo
mmzzcc2 [30k\]: i'll think more];W[gb];B[if];W[gf];B[pg];W[pi]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[lo]
(;W[on];B[mp];W[op];B[lq]C[mmzzcc2 [30k\]: will u help me at the end?]
;W[nq];B[oh]C[You can extend to center.]
(;W[oi]TR[pi][pj]C[This position.... It's called empty triangle, it's a bad shape.
you can ask me: what good and bad shape means?

Well, a shape is considered good when it helps you to make territory fast and safe. It's bad when you can't live or you lose too much time trying to make him live.]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[mh];W[li];B[mi];W[mj];B[lj];W[lk];B[kj];W[nk]
;B[ml]C[This is called peeping... You should answer in N9. Otherwise, you'll suffer a bigger pain in future.]

(;W[lm];B[mm];W[mn];B[ln];W[nn];B[mk];W[nj];B[kk];W[ll];B[km]
;W[nm];B[kl]C[You see? Now you lost your possibility to jump to center and some stones either.]
;W[nl];B[hg];W[gg];B[gh];W[fh];B[fi];W[hf];B[ig]C[mmzzcc2 [30k\]: thx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In F11 you can gain more territory.]

(;W[qc]C[I think there is no space to live here. And you should defend your group in F13.]

Well, I hope you apreciatte my comments. I think your should study this points:

1- Life and dead (this way you'll know when play in the groups who were in great danger)

2- Fuseki and Joseki (here you'll know more about where and how  to play)

And play more, of course!!! And have fun!!! If you can join pleasure and study you'll grow really fast. Consult goproblems and others sites to study.

See ya and if you have any doubt, write me a email.])
