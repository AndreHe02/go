C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for the review.  I have no idea where I'm going wrong, except that it seems I fall badly behind very early in the game every time I play.  In this game, I think the fatal error was playing a pincer attack in the bottom right corner.  I immediately ended up with a weak group, and this seemed to spread all over the board like a virus.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

Hi, my name is Emiliano Bacci (laver on KGS).
I will do my best for making this review suitable to you.];B[qd]
;W[dp]C[Ted: I thought about playing at D16 instead, to prevent my opponent from playing a Chinese fuseki, but I don't think it makes that much of a difference.

I think perhaps just a very strong 9 dan pro is able to
aperceive the difference... Don't worry about this.
Your move is a good one.];B[dd];W[qp]C[Ted: I thought about approaching in one of the corners (more likely at P17) to prevent Black from getting his choice of fuseki, but stronger players insist that the right idea is to take the last corner.

Approaching the komoku is considered equal to taking
the remaining corner (see Shusaku's fuseki, for instance).
There is no preference on that. Just play what you prefer.
The important thing is not to make moves you don't feel confident about.
If you prefer to approach the komoku, do it. Not only go theory , but also your joy and pleasure of playing will be supporting you:)]
;B[nc];W[qj]TR[nc][qd]C[Ted: I've been told that something around this star point is the best way to respond to Black's enclosure.  I played R10 instead of Q10 because the last time I had such a game, I played on the fourth line and ended up with an extremely weak group that had no way to make two eyes.

Your move is a good one. Q10 also good. By the way, it seems to me that you evaluate how good moves are depending on the final outcome. That's not always true: mistakes can happen later in the game, making the previous good moves to seem bad ones...]
;B[oq];W[mq]C[Ted: Here's where everything goes wrong.  Pincer attacks work for my opponents when they play them against me, but for some reason they never seem to work when I try them.

I guess the moral is that I should work more on building large moyos than attacking my opponent.

The pincer is an attacking move. The idea is make it difficult for the opponent to make a base. Especially after R10 (Q10 would bettere following this strategy), pincer is a good choice. White has 3 stones in the lower right, Black just one. So attacking seems to be natural, ain't?]
;B[oo]
(;W[qn]C[Ted: Would it have been better to play at Q7 or R7 here?  I was worried that Black might respond with R5, isolating the R4 stone and taking the entire corner.  In light of Black's later splitting attack at R8, I think Q6 here would be pointless.

No, your analysis is incorrect this time. Q6 is the only move, following the joseki theory. And here is the reason why. Tha pincer is an attaking move, so why to play calmly R6 after a severe attack such as N3?
Q6 makes more territory, and White has a very nice shape on the right. Q7 or R7 are very bad here. White becomes too weak, so that Black will have no trouble in getting good shape. See variations]
;B[qr]
(;W[jq]C[Ted: I thought this was a great move.  I didn't see what Black was going to play next.

Clearly, I have to do something with the N3 stone.  It would make no sense at all to play a pincer attack if one were intending to sacrifice the stone that's doing the pincering.

Disagree. If the purpose of the pincer is to let you make huge territory on the right (but note, this is not the case in this match), that stone culd be sacrified.
Moreover, it is hard to kill it. 
I would have played P7 first, then K3. If Black responds to P7 with a pincer, White has a nice backup when jumping out with N5. Sew variations.]
;B[ql]
(;W[pl]C[Ted: If I understand correctly, the strategic object here is to keep the two groups of black stones separated, and try to make territory while Black is shoring up both of them.  With that in mind, I guess I should have played at Q7, with the intention of jumping out to O7 and putting pressure on the lower group of black stones on my next move.

Your idea is correct, but you did the opposite!!!
Q8 is rather passive. The correct way to attack here is Q7 (see variation)]
;B[pk]
(;W[pm]C[Noo!. Cut!
See variation.];B[qk];W[nm]C[Ted: I get to play at O7 anyway, but it doesn't seem to put any pressure on Black's group at the bottom, *and* I end up losing the R10 stone.

The top right is enormous, now...];B[qh];W[gq]LB[ok:B][mn:A]
[rq:C][nr:D]C[Ted: I guess this is the wrong move.  But I don't know what I should have played instead.  N6?  P9?  S3?  O2?  Or should I have played a tenuki in some other part of the board than G3?

Fuseki theory: first urgent moves, then big moves.

Despite the loss of R10, which was really important, now you have the chance of attacking on the lower right. The goal is not to kill, but to seal in and let Black live small.
Then you will have the chance of building up a moyo.

Second urgent point is at the top right, where a reduction is vital before Black perfects his moyo.

Therefore, I would play first N5 to seal in Black, threating the kill.
Then after the response, probably either C or D, I would switch around P15. Next huge target for White will be D10, to build up a huge moyo.

For all of what I said, G3 really bad. Just 10 points in gote.
Just a nice endgame move...];B[dj]C[Good point for Black. Now White will have a hard life at the top...]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[Ted: Note that for my opponent, the pincer attack works wonderfully well.  I end up with a terribly weak group, and my opponent ends up with no apparent weaknesses.  Why do these things work every time my opponents try them, but never when I try them?  I know there's a proverb about not being too greedy at the goban, but this is really ridiculous.  Is it too much to ask that what works for my opponents work for me, too?

:)) Pincer was good in your case, too.
But errors like Q8 rther than Q7, and than Q7 rather than R9 make at least a 30 point difference.]
;W[fe];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[dh]C[Ted: I figured that since this sort of splitting attack worked for my opponent in the opposite corner, I'd try the same thing.  I try it, and it doesn't work.  Big surprise.

:)) Why don't you follow joseki? 
After the pincer, either you invade at the 3-3 point, or you jump out (as you did) and then J16 to build up some influence, or you fight immediatelt with H16. All other variations are not joseki, as far as I know.]
;B[cn]C[Big mistale for Black. White E13 connects, and is sente for tha Black corner. Black lives small, White has esaped out.]
;W[cp]C[No, bad choice. You are falling into Black's trap...]
;B[cj];W[fh];B[kd];W[mo]C[Ted: I thought I was going to be able to connect the White stones, thanks to the White stones in the opposite corner serving as a ladder breaker, and make Black weak in the corner.  It doesn't quite work that way.

Your move is great, and you id it finally!];B[rq];W[rp];B[oi]
C[Bad move of Black, this time.
What can you do with R10?];W[en]C[Ted: I had sente, and absolutely no idea what to do with it.  I think I should have played at C12 or C13 and put some pressure on the group in the top left.

That would have been a great idea!!!
So, why to play little gote moves as S4????
Play N5 (great) and then around C12 and then, after Black is alive, without losing sente, E6, which also great. After C12, the Black group on the lower left maybe is going to have troubles, so E6 will double its effect.]
;B[dn];W[eo]C[Noo! Play E7. If Black cuts, his cutting stone will be inside a White sea...
The right move is E7];B[nn];W[mn];B[mm]C[First, P6. This is vital. Then seek life with R3. See variation.]

(;W[ml];B[lm];W[nl]C[Ted: I still have to figure out how to get two eyes for the group on the right.]
;B[km];W[mj];B[mh];W[kk];B[im]C[Ted: I think I'm lucky Black didn't play M9 here.

No, you are far from being lucky.
Black's cut was really a bad move.
Your group on the lower right is alive, so N12 is vital for 
stopping white from erasing black' moyo. 
You should take advantage of that.
After C12, Black has 3 weak groups: upper and lower right,
and the silly L7 group.
You should be able to torture them all, maybe to kill one.]
;W[ki];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp]C[Kill Black!!! See variation.]
(;W[fq];B[gn]C[Kill him again! G5!!];W[do];B[go];W[el];B[fj]

and the game is pretty over when looking at the top right...]

;B[dm];W[fn];B[fl];W[bh]C[Ted: I said earlier I should have tried something like this, but in the game it doesn't put as much pressure on the Black group as I think it should.  Indeed, it puts pressure on *my* group at the top.

Yes, now it's too late. Black strenghtened all his groups: at the lower left and at the top (with L16, great move, by the way).]

;B[cd];W[ed];B[ee];W[gb];B[hb];W[eb]C[Ted: At least I'm certain to get two eyes on the top now.]
;B[gc];W[fb]C[Ted: I get my second eye on the first line, although H19 would probably have been marginally better in that I end up with sente.  Not that it would make much difference -- I fear the game is already lost.

Yes it is.];B[gd];W[fd];B[gi];W[gh];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[qf]
C[Ted: This was played out of desperation.  When my opponents play splitting attacks against me, I have difficulty keeping everything connected.  See the attack at R8.  It doesn't work when I try it, though.

You have to improve your fighting abilities :)

;W[pb];B[pc];W[oa];B[mb];W[qq]C[Ted: I realized that I wasn't going to get two eyes at the top, so I tried playing on the bottom to see if I could kill that group.  I was really quite desperate, and of course it was pointless.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[pq];W[or];B[nr]C[Ted: I resigned here since I realized I was so terribly far behind that there was no way to catch up, or to kill Black's group in the corner.

Yes, this is a good time for resigning.
Since it seems to me that you are interested in opening
and fighting, let me tell you what follows as a final comment.

You did not play bad joseki or strategical points.
BUT: it seems to me that you don't know why those are good points. Knowing by heart correct sequences is
worthless if you don't know how and when and why they work.
Consider pincer joseki, as an example. 
Pincer is an attacking move, made to put pressure on
enemy stones. So, you have to continue in this strategy.
Therefore, moves like Q6, K3 in your match are completely out of the question, since they are slow and don't put any pressure.

On the other side, when you are pincered, your major 
concern should be how to settle your group, and not
to play moves like D12. Unless you plan that you can sacrifice the pincered stone...

Second point: reading. I have very few hint to give you on that. But this one is really crucial. 
I remeber your comment at move 51. It is true that M9 destroys you eye shape, but then what? You are alive!
Don't learn shapes by heart and play them thoughtlessly.
In other words, either you read before than placing your stone, or it is likely that the sequence you have in your mind is meaningless.

Finally, the latest comment.
In strategy and fights don't lose your miond and remember:
1) survive/kill
2) stay connected/cut
3) seal in/don't get sealed in.

Those principles may seem to you obvous, but you
didn't respect them a plenty of times during this match.
For instance you let black easily connect L7 and C10 groups, or you let black cut R10, and so on.

Hope this comment will serve to you.])

There are very many variations, but the idea is that Black has two weak groups to take care of, so he has to let you take some advantage, somewhere.
Therefore, the , black invasion is not good, unless Black uses the aji of the invading stone to settle his group. See the other variation.]
