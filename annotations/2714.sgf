C[hannes: Hi, I'm playing white here and luckily won this game but felt as being behind throughout the whole game.
Thanks to the reviewer in advance!

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game for you.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I agree with your feeling that you were behind for much of the game.  I think you played some rather small moves early on -- especially in the lower right and on the top -- but won because Black failed to punish you]

C[Ted: It's usually best to respond to a shimari like Black's by playing at C10 or D10, the reason being that if Black can play there, such a stone would work very well with the shimari.  With such a shimari, extending so that the third stone faces the empty line (in this case, line D), is much better than extending in the other direction (eg. K16/17).  By the same token, if the stones in the shimari were at D17 and C15, the better play would be in the K16 area.

Also, playing at C10 or D10 works well with the stone at D4.]
;B[pc];W[kc];B[pj];W[pg]LB[hc:A]C[hannes: Better extend to A ?

Ted: I don't think that's necessary yet; as I pointed out at White 6, it's more important to play at C/D10 to prevent Black from extending from the shimari.

However, I think the move you played is even less desirable than A.  Black can extend easily from the Q10 stone, and at best you'll end up with thickness that doesn't do much for you.]
;B[dj];W[nq]C[hannes: I remember reading somewhere that this extension is "safe" (whatever that means). But I was happy that black didn't made me prove it. I know that I shall look it up in a joseki-dictionary, but can you write just a few words on it?

Ted: I'm not certain what you mean by "safe", except that it wouldn't be profitable for Black to try to play between the two stones.  If you were to jump further, to N3, Black might try to play at P4, which could reduce your territory.

I think I would have played at L3 here.  That gives you the basic formation of the Chinese fuseki.  Black can still play P4, but the reasoning behind the Chinese fuseki is that you let your opponent reduce you on one side, while making a nice amount of territory on the other.]
;B[jp];W[gq];B[cn];W[cp];B[jj];W[hc]C[Ted: I think this is too small.  You'd be better served to play something that prevents Black from building his moyo; something like D13.]
;B[dg];W[jq]C[Ted: There's an adage that attaching moves like this are defensive.  And to be honest, I'm not certain I like this move, even though in the end it worked out for you.]
;B[kp];W[no]LB[qm:A]C[hannes: Would A have been better? I wanted more contact to the middle of the board.

Ted: I think your desire to get to the middle of the board is the right idea.  There's a go proverb stating that the third line is for territory, and the fourth for influence.  You've already got quite a number of stones on the third line, and if you allow Black to seal you in the corner, things will be difficult for you.  Because Black has already played in the center, letting him get thickness would be especially good for him.]
;B[pm];W[qn]C[Ted: I'm not sure I like this move.  You already have three stones in the corner that work well together, and Black doesn't have *any* in that corner.  This allows Black to seal you in the corner and get thickness that works well for getting territory in the center.]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[on];W[oo];B[nn];W[go]C[hannes: Again I aimed at not giving him all of the middle. But moves on the upper half could have made more territory. What is more important here?

Ted: I think G5 is a good idea.  Consider the situation for White if you put a Black stone there instead.

Later, you should aim for reducing Black by playing either N10, or something like D8.]
;B[en]C[Ted: This makes it difficut for you to play D8.];W[gm]
;B[fl];W[gl]C[Ted: I don't think this move was needed.  I probably would have played around N10 here.]
;B[gk];W[oe]LB[jf:A]C[hannes: Here I tried to build a moyo in the upper half. That worked, but now it seems to me, as if black could have destroyed it easily by playing around A.

Ted: You're right.];B[jm];W[hf];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf];W[jh];B[gd]
C[Ted: I think this move from Black is too small.  Blach should have played around N11 or N12.  The point is that this is around where both of your areas on the right will meet, and each side should want to play there first.]

;W[lk]C[hannes: Try to make his territory smaller.

Ted: Good idea, although I think N10 would be a better way to do it.]

(;W[ji]C[Ted: You had a good chance to reduce Black here by playing S11, which connects to R13 regardless of what Black tries.]
;B[ii];W[kj]C[Ted: This move is very bad.  It does nothing to reduce Black's territory, and even forces him to do something that's good for him.]
;B[jk];W[lm];B[kn];W[kq]C[hannes: I must have overlooked that point. Otherwise I sould have played it more ealy, as it saves my lower side.]
;B[ln];W[nl];B[lp]C[Ted: Black should have played M3 here.  Black doesn't have to worry about the crosscut at M4.]

;W[in];B[ij]C[Ted: Black plays an unneccessary move here, and you follow it up with one of your own.  :-)

Black could have played N3 here];W[ml]C[Ted: I don't like this move.  It's not necessary, and there are bigger moves on the board.  Black's next move (G17) is one example, as is B5.]
