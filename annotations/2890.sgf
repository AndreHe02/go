Firstly, I'm going to comment on the game, move by move, as I read through it the first time. Then I'l come back for some serious analysis.]
;B[qd]C[You haven't asked for any fuseki comments, so I'll skip any fuseki comments that don't relate to a clear advantage or disadvantage.]
;W[dd];B[dq];W[co];B[pq]C[You really like those 3-4 points, eh? :)]
;W[qo]C[I think if I were White, I'd play in the bottom left. Now I think the game will get complicated.]
;B[po];W[pp]C[I have no idea whether or not this is joseki. To me, the obvious response looks like r4. Q6 might also be doable, trying to get influence on both sides. I'll put in some variations later.]
;B[qp]C[Next move for White *is* obvious];W[op]C[Now what? Obviously not R3, because the ladder favours White. P3 perhaps?]
;B[qn]C[Seems to capture r5, but... Wr3 Bs5 Ws4 Br5 not great, or Wr3 Bs4 Wq5 Bq6 Ws3 Bs5 bad. I'll add variations.]

Oh yeah, very nice for Black, given sente.];B[eo]C[Seems to lack support on the right. White is very strong there, and you may end up being attacked.]
;W[nc]C[A give-away. White should take the big point on the bottom, around k3. I think Bk4 or there abouts would be good now.]
;B[cf]C[Man, you guys are mixing it up!

I don't like c14. It's bad direction. The top left is really uninteresting, with the stone on the 4-4 point. You should take the big point that the Black and White thickness is facing at the bottom, make a moyo on the right (r13 perhaps), or attack the bottom left with d6, c4, or perhaps c6.

The bottom side is still the biggest. White should play there next.]
;W[ch]C[Fair enough, locally, but later there might be the possibility of a splitting attack on both c12 and c5.]

(;B[cc]C[I think I'd have gone e14 (I'll put in a variation to show the most common joseki), but c17 is fine.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[fe]C[Joseki for White here would have been g15, d14, perhaps f16 or tenuki. F15 is very inefficient, and aims at no weakness in Black.

Still, White has good thickness, which is already helping c5.]

;B[pf]C[Nice. I didn't consider this move, but it seems to work well on the right side.]
;W[ic]C[Bad by White. One stone closer, at h17, would have threatened e18. E18 is really something you have to be mindful of, from either perspective, when you have played the joseki in the top left. Also, notice how much better a potential h17 play would have been if f15 had been at g15.

I think Black can take a big point now, with something like o6 or f7, or start a leaning attack with l4, for example.]
;B[gd];W[ec]C[Useless. White still had the potential to threaten e18 later on, but this move wastes that potential.]
;B[eb];W[gb];B[fb];W[pb];B[kc]C[I think k17 or n17 would have been better.]
;W[ie];B[ke];W[nf];B[pi];W[qj]C[Attacking Black's top center would make more sense - it is still weak, so an attack would give profit in sente. Also, White's top right corner is still a potential target for Black, and Black will surely gain strength in the coming fight against r10, which will give support to the l17 stones and put pressure White's three top-right stones.]

This is my last question. If you see anything later of interest please do tell me, but for me the most important part of the game is over after this sequence is finished.


Thank you for reviewing this game


Chris


You didn't need to stop it from happening. Just accept it and play a decent end-game. In the variation for the next move, I play out what I consider to be a reasonable end-game from here on in. Black has sente for now, and can use it to make a lot of profit until there is only gote left.

More specifically, exchanging third line plays for second line plays was leaving you short of liberties straight away, and this combination (l16 and m14) worked as soon as you cut with o15.]

Major problems:
Giving White a moyo, with c17 and c4
Not extending far enough, with j3
Making small gote end-game moves long before their time. Remember, if a move is gote, you should be happy about your opponent taking it first, because it gives you sente when you didn't have it!
Invading too deep, and ultimately unsuccessfully, with c12
Not accepting your loss, with m16])
