;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cg]LB[ce:a][cf:b]C[is there much difference for white to spread two or three squares from hoshi?

TA: Yes, there is. In general, you can say, playing at a (diaogonal from hoshi protects against 3-3, with b 3-3 lives with ko and at 6, the invasion at 3-3 just lives.  But nevertheless, this is OK as well. If you let black invade at 3-3, you surely get a strong wall facing the outside. This is OK.]
;B[id];W[gq];B[jp]C[is this a gd attack? or is it not time yet?

TA: I think, it is OK, since the white attack on the corner is not so strong, you can afford to play from the other side. Ususally, white would invade into 3-3 now, but this doesn't look good here.]
;W[go];B[dn]C[too defensive?];W[jr];B[nq]TR[jp]LB[qn:a]C[felt under threat, is this a "right " move at such time?

TA: I would prefer the other side (a). Your marked stone might be a bit weak, but since it still can easily step out, don't care so much. White needs anyway at least two more moves to attack. a does much more for your right side.]

TR[qq]C[attempt to save the weak grp not sure if there is a better move

TA: It is much better to save the group with the 3-3 move. This move is a big territorial difference, or white answers , but the you keep sente.]
;W[nc]LB[pr:a]C[TA: I think, a is much bigger...];B[qg];W[qi]
LB[kc:a]C[TA: No. This move is too small. Better easily make a base with your weak stone at the top, eg. at a. This also weakens the top left black group!]
;B[lc]C[TA: YOu see the difference: Now black has a base and presses white!]
;W[ne];B[og];W[mg]LB[mf:a][ng:b]C[TA: Either a or b keep the connection and are better.]
;B[nf];W[mf]LB[me:a]C[TA: No. this will be cut. So better white gives in and draws back with a]
;B[me];W[le]C[TA: This move shows that white gives in after playing the two stones at the top. But this corner is too big (although white can get a bit, starting at 3-3). White should have crawled out.]
;B[md];W[ng];B[of];W[ld];B[nd]LB[mc:a]C[TA: No! this leaves too much aji. a is essential!]
;W[mc];B[oe]LB[od:a]C[TA: again, a leaves much less aji and helps at the top.]
;W[kc]C[TA: this gets desastrous now, since all the white stones are alive again!]
;B[lb];W[oc]LB[kb:a]C[TA: This is an error: Now black can walk out with a. 44 doesn't threaten anything.]
;B[od]C[TA: This looses the top stones again. A pity!];W[kb]
;B[pc];W[mb];B[db];W[cc];B[ib]LB[cj:a]C[TA: Too small. Don't go for territory here. a (C10) is much bigger!]

;W[gc];B[gb];W[gd];B[ec];W[he];B[ie];W[fg];B[eh]LB[hg:a]C[TA: black should try to keep the weak groups connected before destroying white territory. White a (H13) would nicely seperate black and put him into deep trouble.]
;W[dh];B[gh];W[kf]LB[hg:a]C[TA: Still a (H13) is crucial! I think, the center black group would suffer too much...]
;B[nn]C[TA: I think, in this area, 3-3 is still the biggest point! Compare it.]

C[TA: Good move! Trying to connect the weak groups.];W[oh];B[ph]
;W[pi];B[kr]C[i think i might had gone wrong with this move.

TA: I think, it is not too bad, but maybe the continuation is wrong.]
;W[kq]
(;B[jq]LB[lr:a]C[TA: What about a here?];W[lr];B[kp];W[lq]
(;B[lp]LB[kn:a]C[TA: this is not good. If connecting, the bamboo joint is correct or even a.]
;W[ir];B[mr];W[ks];B[ms]LB[qr:a]C[TA: If you are scared about the bottom group, betterplay at a]
;W[ls]LB[jn:a][rh:b][bk:c][cq:d]C[TA: Too small (1point). Much bigger are a to d.]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[kn]C[after this move is the two white seeds dead? i just feel by playing here nailed them down.

TA: I think so.];W[ji];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki]
(;W[li]C[TA: What about the variation?];B[kj];W[ih];B[jg];W[hg]
;B[ii];W[jj];B[jk];W[ij];B[hi];W[ig];B[hf];W[gg]LB[jf:a];B[gf]
;W[ff];B[eg]LB[hj:a]C[TA: If both play correctly, these stones are dead so you sould rather try nto save them, e.g. with a (H10). You are lucke that white messes it up and your group escapes!]
;W[ef]LB[df:a][di:b][dj:c][ck:d]C[TA: No, 1 place lmore left is correct shape (at a). this eliminastes also the bad aji at b, c, d which helped black.]
;B[dg];W[df]LB[jf:a][ch:b]C[TA: Since white is alive with capturing at a, he can still afford to play b. This definitely kills the left center group.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[dj];W[dh]C[TA: This stone is worth nothing, so why go for it at all? Its a pity.]
;B[ck];W[em];B[dl];W[eo];B[do]LB[dq:a]C[is it necessary for me to respond here or should i be trying other worthy of more value places... but it seems that this piece of territory is large and needed to be guarded....

TA: What is the proble, if white gets this piont? He still cannot enter the left border, so I think, closing the corner is much bigger! E.g. a
This also implies that instead of the white move, the 3-3 invasion would have been much better (at least 15 points). Of course you know that 3-3 bbites out a pretty big part of the corner, so it is more than urgent now.]
;W[en]LB[cb:a][rh:b][cq:c][dr:d]C[TA: No. These moves are not urgent. The upper left black group is surely not yet alive, so attacking here (at a) will give you sente profit (i.e. its free!). Other good moves are  b to d, which all are sente and gain some points. Please try to look out for sente moves. This will make you 2 stones stronger!]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[gj];W[hh];B[gi]C[TA: All these moves are worth 1 or 2 points. So why not take the points mentioned above, which can gain more than 10 points (e.g. 3-3). In the beginning you feel good when you can gain one point while feeling that your opponent has to answer. This feeling is suddenly lost, when you come to an opponent who does not defend this single point, but grabs away your whole corner in the meantime. Can you agree?]
;W[dr]C[Aha!];B[cq];W[ep];B[dq];W[eq]C[TA: 1 point lower makes the sequence sente, because white will not answer after black closes the corner. another example, where it is worth thinking about sente...]

;B[im];W[hm];B[in]LB[cb:a][rh:b][ob:c][rr:d]C[i think this move might be too small any where better?

TA: You are right, most of theses moves are tto small, because they make a difference of one point. It is not difficult to see, that this is too little unless the board is really full. Better moves are e.g. a to d.]

;W[fa]C[TA: Until now, the black group was dead, (and it still is, as you will see). Since the area around the last move is only one eye anyway (check it out!), the last move could have been used to prevent the outside eye.]
