C[Hello,
my main problem is that I still haven't got the right feeling when and where to invade or not.

Hi,
My name is Daan and I'm about 7k. My comments will be marked with 'D:'.]

(;W[dn]C[D: This play by white is unexpected. It is a very heavy play, leading to chunks of heavy stones, both for white and for black which will bother you both for quite some time.
White is also too slow in developing his two stones in the bottomleft corner. Black should try to take advantage of this.

I have included a common joseki for this approach+pincer. More info can be found on senseis.xmp.net.]

(;B[do]C[D: I'd say this is too heavy, though others will undoubtedly disagree with me. Some alternatives have been listed.]
;W[fp];B[fn]C[not sure if this is correct but my intention was to keep the white groups separated

D: This is in principle a good idea. If you keep white from solidifying her groups you can profit while chasing her around. However, your black stones are looking a bit weak and heavy. You lack good shape and you don't have a lot of room to make eyes on the side. So in this situation you have to remain aware that you too have to be able to get two eyes somewhere. So while keeping white seperated is good, it wouldn't hurt to make some good shape (first).]
;W[el];B[cq]C[trying to make a base

D: Sound thinking.];W[cr];B[bq];W[hp]
(;B[jq]C[Not sure if this move is too aggressive!?

D: Your group on the left is still a little weak. You can still run with it though, so puttting pressure on white is not necessarily bad. Also keep in mind that white has a weak group on the left as well. You might be able to use that weakness to your advantage at some point in the game, or to save your own stones.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[dp];B[bn];W[lq]C[D: White is playing very aggressively here. White gets into a lot of trouble with the marked stone later.]
;B[jo];W[iq]
(;B[jr]C[I'm trying to keep the one white stone separated from the rest

D: Good. If the white stone on the right was a little stronger it might not have been such a good idea, though. This move effectively cuts off the white stone on the right, but it does make your own group heavier. See the variation for a more peaceful approach.]

(;W[kp]TR[lq]C[D: too heavy. The two marked stones have no base at all.]

(;W[ir];B[jm]C[By making a one point jump I'm trying to keep  this group "mobile".

D: Good choice.];W[pr]TR[kp][lq]C[I think this move was too aggressive by White or am I wrong?

D: white needs to do something in this corner. The two marked stones seem lost, but maybe white can use them as a threat. I think white should try to live in the corner by sacrificing the two marked stones.
However, you can profit from that greatly.];B[nq]C[would have keeping the corner with R3 been better?

D: I like this better than R3. Giving white a small corner in exchange for a lot of influence seems like good play.]

(;W[nr]TR[kp][lq]C[D: I think White should sacrifice the two marked stones and move into the corner.]

D: the idea is good. you shouldn't let white make a base here.]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[kr];B[kq];W[ls]C[was this the best respones White could make or would have saving the two lonely white stones been better?

D: Saving the two stones was probably a hopeless cause. White should never have let it come this far, but she should have played less aggresively much earlier (see variations)
You can now have a strong wall, a lot of influence and the potential to get a lot of territory.]

;W[jf];B[ke];W[je];B[kd];W[jd];B[ch]TR[jd][je][jf]C[Not sure if this was the right invading move. Maybe I should have played closer to the corner with C14 or C15.

D: I think this is well possible. Probably most moves are possible. This move allows you to extend to both sides reasonably well, and you should be able to get a good base here. The three marked stones do not help.]
;W[dh];B[di]C[I think extending to C11 would have been better

D: C11 is more firm. It is also less agile and gives you less room to wriggle around. Maybe D13 would have been nice as well, or else a 1 point extension to either side.
When invading, keep in mind that you probably have to sacrifice some stones.]

D: If the invasion on the left had succeeded you would have won with a big margin. The rest of your play was good and solid. You made very good use of your strength on the right, you got most of your territory there, thanks to the two walls white let you build.
Please note the great use of the white wall down the middle. The territory you gained with the three marked stones is compensated by white's territory on the other side. I think you should have invaded earlier, before white got to strengthen her position.
