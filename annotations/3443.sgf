This was a fun game, and I think we're about the same in strengh. We decided to pass after a certain point because we lacked time, and honestly it sort of showed what was goin to happen at our levels over at the left side.

Even so, we played seriously and would both like comments on our gameplay. Im the only one commenting, cause we're online friends and I cant reach him any time soon :-\]

NA-Hi, my name is Nathan and I will be reviewing your game.
  I will try to precede my comments with my initials like here.  
      One point of concern, the game record I recieved to review has white making the first move but there are no handicap stones.  Was this an error in the record or intentional?  Following conventions such as black moving first makes it easier to communicate with others and prevent confusion especially if you intend to send the game into the teaching ladder for example.  Not a huge problem but just something to remember in the future.]

he attacked and I defended. Was that a good move? should I have been attackin?

NA-Defending or attacking would both be acceptable.   There is a great variety especially in the opening available to go players.  If and when you are ready to start delving into the issue maybe you can read something about joseki.  You will learn that you can do alot of different things in situations like this but that you have to think carefully about how the choices you make in one place will effect and be effected by other parts of the board and the game as a whole.
      One particular concern with this position is simply that blacks move isn't technically incorrect but it is not used very often.  The point I've marked by "A" is MUCH more common.  This basically has to do with the flexibility of that move.  It has alot more different options that it opens up.  Of course if black likes the move they have played here (or white : ) then by all means continue with it, experiment etc.]
;B[nd];W[pf]C[W:
again....];B[je]TR[fd][nd]C[NA--I know alittle bit about joseki but not alot.  I remember reading that one of the major times when the triangled approach moves are appropriate is when black (in this case) is trying to build moyo (moyo is just a large potential territory.  It's not solid and is still subject to invasion but it's clear whose staking a claim).  I don't really know anything beyond that but this seems to be an example of this strategy.
             One concern might be that this isn't the best place squeezed between the two white corners.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to play one of these approach moves if the other corner was black.  Then black would really following the idea above and staking out a large territorial framework.  See the variation to move 4.]
;W[jj]C[W:
After playin his weird move, i thought maybe center could make up for it somehow. Not sure.

NA--Blacks move here makes alot of sense.  If he doesn't make a move like this then a white move around K16 would seperate them both and very likely one of them would die.  This moves makes one position that is not necessarily immune to attack but is at least a good foundation.  White though should follow the general rule "Corners first, then the Sides, and the Middle last"   In this case there is still a corner open and extensions from your corner positions such as C10 or R10 would be big.]
;B[jn]C[NA--This move seems too high and the lower right corner is still open.]
;W[dk]C[NA--This move is more the right idea but that corner is still calling to be taken!]
;B[gq];W[en];B[np];W[jp]C[W:
I rushed in without thinking too much, and caused the havoc to come :D I think i should have attacked from the other side to gain more territory. (like O8)


NA--Yah, given that the right side is open it feels to me like this is uneccessarily deep.  You are invading a fairly restricted space.  Invading the top also seems like it would have been better.  In that case you would have something to run to on either side and plenty of space under the black stones and in either direction, even if you don't actually connect with the white stones.  H5 looks to me like a pretty severe response for black if they had chosen it.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn]C[NA- You wedge into this tight spot which could be a good move but doesn't really get a follow up.  See the variation for instance.]

at this point i should have attacked at M4, correct?


NA--No.  At this point, that group has 2 eyes and playing inside it anywhere is a waste.]
;B[lp]C[NA--This move is also wasted.  No reply is needed.]
;W[hp];B[mo]C[NA-Wasted.]
(;W[jp]C[NA-Wasted. J3 has the value that if you convince black to connect  then you can connect also and you are into the lower side.  See variation.]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[kp]C[NA-Wasted and at this point this is actually a bad move because letting white get into the lower side just should never have been a possibility after how the fight turned out.]

Now, the next few moves were a real joy for me! I had to think real hard, and finally came to the conclusion that by playing here I can save this group and not do somethin that would let him take over areas.]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[oo];W[kl]C[W:
all i could think about was disconnectin those 3 from the group. even back when they were 2.

(;B[kj]C[NA-This move is bad for black because it forces white to make his own position stronger.  M11 would allow the black stones to escape, because white must respond and then black connects/extends.  See variation.]
;W[ki];B[pk]C[W:
black doing this move was really tough for me again. I wasnt sure what to do here. really complicated at this point when im tryin to save myself from more losses.]

I never saw it comin lol

NA-Good job black!];W[nj]C[NA-I can't understand this move.]
;B[ol]C[NA-Or this one.];W[oi];B[qj]C[NA--This is exactly the right idea here.  This black stone in atari is irrelevant..   White could have saved their stones already if they wanted to and losing this stone can't hurt black at all. (Notice that this is still true even if P8 had been ommitted.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh]C[NA--This is an akward move which allows black to capture the 3 white stones.  Playing on the edge of the board is rarely useful, unless it's absolutely necessary or at the end of the game.]
;B[rn];W[qo];B[ro];W[qh];B[sm];W[sl];B[sk];W[rl]C[NA-This move is giving stones away and shouldn't be replied to.]

I attacked here, but im not sure its the best thing i could do about this situation. I was scared of his K15 stone.

(;W[bs]C[W:
my thoughts were that this is the correct place to play to stop him from gettin his group to live there and keep it as my territory.

NA--This is indeed a good spot but playing here now isn't necessary.  See variation.]
;B[cs]C[NA--There's some lively fighting in this game which is a good thing.  There were alot of basic mistakes though too.  I guess the thing for both players to focus on is to think more about the moves you are making.  Alot of the mistakes are wasted moves you are both clearly good enough to recognize you shouldn't be making.  You both at times show comprehension of what's going on to a degree that makes many of the mistaken moves surprising for seeming to not pay attention.                This is a problem I also struggle with so I know how it is to get caught up in things and lose sight of basic principles but this is a bad habit which has cost me many a game despite doing my best to study the game and try to improve.  That makes it all the more frustrating.  I guess I would say I think this skill, to simply but seriously think through every move you make is more important that any other skill in this game.  The  point is to have a specific intention and to have thought out why the move you choose helps you to accomplish your goal.  You may not always find the best possible means but you will be playing at the best level you are capable of playing at and that's really what makes go fun.  I can tell that white already has this spirit from some of the comments he made, just more application is needed.
           I would say in my experience the second most important skill is the capacity to economize your moves.  To not waste them and to make moves that represent the maximum possible efficiency and possibility.  This can often look strange in practice because it means that you often have to let go of things like small groups of stones for bigger profit elsewhere.  In go it seems to be true that often things that seem abstract or intangible like influence and even-distribution are more important than tangible but small gains such as saving/taking a couple stones or taking a corner but letting the opponent seal you in.  Of course you have to be able to capitalize on those advantages if you choose to pursue them and that takes practice but that's what the really good players do.
           My last comment along these lines is just to do with the opening.  I think you both did a pretty good job there.  I would just suggest focusing more on building positions and less on plunging right into conflict.  At the point where white invades the lower side right at the beginning of the game, white recognized they should have tried the right side first.  Black  could have ignored that invasion stone and built a position on the left side for example, which he was trying to do at the end when it was too late.  Since Black already had plenty of stones in the area white rushed into, he could easily have let white live but still come out with more total territory in the end.

         Ok that's all I've got.  Hope it wasn't too much!  Keep playing and thanks for letting me comment.
