Thanks


Hello Fausto,

my name is Christian Reiling - German 1 dan.

I hope I will be able to help you with this review.


Greetings

;B[po]LB[nc:B][fc:A]C[Kato Masao: "The Chinese Opening" (TCO) says:

Better at A instead.


Maybe this move is a bit to slow - Black is flat on the right side,
if W plays B next.];W[nc]C[Yes!];B[pf]LB[kd:A]C[Black "flattens" himself.

Better some pincer around A instead.];W[qc]LB[jd:A]C[It's too early this?

Yes, I think this is far too early.

Better at A instead.];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[cn]
LB[ck:4][cq:3][bp:2][fp:1][cf:A]TR[jq]C[I think A is better here, because the left upper star point is thinner.

If W responds with 1, B 2, W3, B4, White has sente and
the marked W stone is ideally placed!];W[cj]C[Hmmm, maybe playable.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[dq];B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[df]C[Better on 3rd line.]

;W[fi];B[fe];W[hd];B[lq];W[ok]C[Maybe I've to play move like G13 or H12?

H12 is too soft - G13 is better.

But I think you do not have to attack immediately.];B[pi]C[Could you comment the following sequence?

;B[kn]LB[lm:A]C[this is a dangerous situations for me could you see some other way to play this following sequence(I've to avoid this situation maybe)?

A would be far less risky.]

Well done!];B[kh];W[ld];B[bq];W[nq];B[fq]LB[nr:A]C[Strange, shouldn't B play A first?!]
