RE[W+R]

;B[cp]C[I got crushed in this game, but the question is, do I have serious strategic wrong ideas, or do I just blunder too often. I know from my chess experience that tactics always trump strategy and have always gotten beaten up by tactical "bullies." .. I'm wondering if this game is a similar case, or if I'm actually going about things in the wrong way, or if I just need to expand my knowledge of patterns somehow.

The nice thing about Go is that you can get quite far without the kind of detailed tactical reading that is necessary in chess, but then you have to build up a store of pattern-recognition so that you can recognize specific bad and good shapes.  You already commented on the empty triangle as bad shape.  Every bad shape is an opportunity to look for better moves.  Ask yourself "If I'm not going to play the empty triangle here, what alternatives do I have?" and try to read one or two promising looking ones two or three moves into the future.  It is also a good thing to do even when you don't see bad shape.  Just now and then when you are about to play the "obvious move", see what alternatives you have, and explain to yourself what is wrong with them.

Go well!

David];W[pq];B[dd];W[pc];B[eq];W[qj];B[pe]C[This is a reasonable attack, as I see it, but I'm sure the dan players would be able to make more informed comments as to how well it works with your other stones.]
;W[qg]C[An appropriate response.  I can't find a good reference to this situation in my joseki dictionary, because the supporting stone affects the situation quite a lot, but then I only gave a cursory look.  If you want to find out about what you should have done in joseki situations, look for kogo's joseki dictionary at http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm.  An excellent downloadable resource.  Free, too, last time I checked.  However, one should not just memorize joseki.  That is the way to ruin.  Better to try and understand them, and if possible, get a dan-level player to explain the reasoning to you.]
;B[pg]C[I don't know the joseki here but my goal is to establish some influence and press White down to the side.

Well, this might be a reasonable response, but your final situation has you ending up with little influence.  I'll explain why when we get there.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe];B[ph];W[qi];B[qh]C[This is a wasted move:  White counters easily, strengthening his position.  Better to leave the aji there.  This (I think) is aji-keshi.]
;W[rh];B[dj]LB[md:A][ke:B]C[This is a good move, but you have not yet finished your attack on the other side of the board.  You have a heavy group which will need defending.  I would consider something like N16 or L15. (A or B).]
;W[fc]
(;B[cg]LB[ec:A]C[This response should have been at E17 (A) in my opinion.  (see variation.)]
;W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[jp]C[I feel as though I did well in this opening.

You did do better than white, but watch out for your heavy group.  A group is just influential if it is easy to defend.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[kp];B[qo]LB[jn:A]C[Or perhaps A?

A is also a strong move, but the one you played is interesting.  It has an option to jump into the corner if white doesn't defend.]
;W[cl]C[At this point, white is behind, so he has to do something to reduce your territory.]
;B[dm]LB[cm:A]C[C7 (A) looks better.  Less chance for white to expand.]
;W[bj];B[ci]C[A safe response.];W[bi];B[bh];W[dk];B[ek]LB[cm:A]
C[This worked out OK for you, but it looks a bit ambitious to me.  I would rather play C7 (A), so that white has to fight for eye-space.  Then you can gain territory by chasing him around the board.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[cm];B[dn];W[cn];B[co];W[cj];B[ei]C[White can live but I am happy with my influence; did I deal well with this invasion?

It turned out OK, and I don't have any major complaints.];W[bk]
;B[jn]LB[qo:A][rq:B][ql:C][oo:D]C[This move is a good one as it stands.  Making terrotory, putting a little bit of pressure on the white group.  However, remember that you were considering it as a possible alternative to R5 (A).  After having played A, you must defend it.  I would suggest S3 (B) or R8 (C).  P5 (D) is also good.]
;W[ko];B[jj]C[Right now I think this was a little ambitious.

Not so much ambitious, but you should be thinking about your invading stone, and the heavy group at the top right.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[jr]C[Ouch - I missed that; things start to go sour.]
;B[iq]LB[hq:A]C[Empty triangle. Was there better??

There is always a better move than the empty triangle in a situation like this...

I would suggest H3 (A).  It is a stronger defense.];W[ir];B[hr]
LB[hq:A]C[Oops.
Quite right.  Better to play H3 (A).];W[hq];B[ip];W[gr];B[gq]
;W[hs]C[Phew! He definitely didn't have to do that, so I get a chance again.

Agreed.];B[hp]C[Another empty triangle!!  Maybe G4 would be better?]
;W[fr];B[fq];W[er];B[dr];W[po]C[This should by now come as no surprise.]
;B[qp]LB[qq:A][pn:B]C[Good?
It's OK, R3 (A) and Q6(B) are other options.  This is basically a joseki position, which you can look up at leisure.]
;W[pp];B[qq]C[Good?

This is a good move.  going for the corner will certainly help your group to live.]
;W[qn];B[rn]LB[pr:A]C[Maybe Q2 (A) instead to make sure of the corner.]
;W[qr];B[rr]C[Good?

OK, given that you let him get R2.];W[pr];B[pn]LB[qm:A]C[Here I think A was better - at least safer.
I agree.];W[qm];B[pm]C[Mistake. I had to crawl.
I agree.];W[rm]C[Can Black live now?
It certainly looks dire.  However, the important, and hopeful, thing, is that you saw for yourself some of the moves that would have avoided this situation.]

(;B[so];W[rp]C[Ouch. The game remains interesting though because of the fight that follows.]
;B[rq];W[rs];B[sr];W[sp];B[kn];W[ln];B[lm];W[mm]C[This looks loose. Is it possible to combine threats somehow of (1) invading White's territory, (2) counterattacking on the right, and (3) cutting and linking up to the two stones on the right? This is what I tried to do, but either this is impossible or I lacked the skill to do it. If the latter, how does one best acquire such skill? I'm studying tesuji problems just about every day but haven't seen any improvement in results.

Maybe a good go-player could suggest a better way to handle this, but I think you did as well as could reasonably be expected out of this situation.]
;B[mn];W[lo];B[ml];W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[mo];W[mp];B[om];W[no]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pj];W[hi]C[Whoa! With White's position I'd have played much more modestly after the big kill in the corner. But with Black .. since my group on the lower right is dead I am obliged to try and kill this stone. On the other hand I think I should have good chances to do it. Where's it going to run? Where will its eyes be? My understanding it that confining a stone like this (from above) without playing too close to it should be sufficient to kill it providing there aren't too many weak links in my walls. Are there? What sort of guidelines are there to know such a thing? How many cutting points, and how long should the segments be between those cutting points? In the game my wall fell apart like papier-mache and this happens distressingly often.

I agree that the white stone should have died.  However, white was playing far above his stated level of 21k here.  I will make such suggestions as I can, but if you are unsatisfied with what I have to offer, please submit my review for a second opinion at GTL.  If you do that, please also send me a copy of the review.]
;B[hg]C[A good response.];W[jh]LB[ih:A][ii:B][hg:C][jj:D]C[The white stones here are what is called a "keima".  The proverb says "strike at the waist of the keima" (points J11 and J12, A and B).  This is (except for special cases) a successful cut.  In this case, I think that would have stopped the invasion from getting out of hand, especially as your stones at H13 and L10 (C and D) are so well placed to support the cut.]
;B[jf]C[But this also seems reasonable to me.];W[fj]C[This cut doesn't intimidate me so I block from below.

In hindsight, you might reconsider your lack of intimidatedness?]
;B[hk];W[ej];B[di];W[gh];B[ff]LB[gg:A]C[This move might have worked better at G13.  (A) This looks to me like a case where you would rather not give him too much space.  Also, G13 is good support for H13, making a much more solid wall.]
;W[if]LB[hg:A][jf:B]C[Is this good? Should it have been allowed? How should play proceed?

This is an example of white "striking at the waist" of the keima at H13 and K14 (A and B).  Although the cutting stone is not unconditionally alive, the threat gives white some wiggle room:  To kill the cutting stone and keep your stones connected, you will likely let white off the hook.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[kf]TR[ff][hg][ig]C[As long as I connect the marked stones and keep White cut off I feel like I should have the upper hand out of that sequence.

This was the right move to keep the white group confined to the centre, but as you noticed, your stones are now cut off from each other.  Notice that the two marked groups are separated by a keima, and are therefore vulnerable to cutting.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[gf]C[Two rather strange moves by white, I would rather have tried to save the cutting stone, or cut the black stones.  White does neither.]
;B[fg]
(;W[lg]C[This is the right extension.  If white played one stone further down, you would have good shape by playing the clamp (see varition.)]
;B[me]C[This may have been too loose? (since White drives through this)

Another keima.  Easy to cut...];W[gk]LB[em:A]C[Now the cut at A makes me nervous so I have to hane though I'd rather not.]
;B[gl]TR[ek][el]LB[gk:A][hl:B]C[This move is bad shape.  I say this because if you had the stones marked with triangles (E8-9 and G8), it would be good shape for white to play G9 (A).  Maybe a better player would give better reasons for this, but I always remember this shape from the fact that black would like to play "A" to complete his bamboo joint.  In this case, white is also threatening another cut at H8 (B).]
;W[ki];B[gj]C[I was rather relieved to take care of this situation but maybe I should have played on the right?

I must say, I rather like this move.  Remember that you also have the cut at J11 still lying around...  That cut would be a way of defusing the situation by splitting the white group, making it less of an "all or nothing" fight.]
;W[lf]C[Big move by white, continuing on the "keima" theme ;-)]
;B[le];W[ke]C[At least psychologically this cut ends up being a big turning point. During the game I couldn't believe it could succeed.

But in retrospect, knowing about the waist of the keima, you will now see that it is quite reasonable ;-)]
;B[je];W[kd];B[jd];W[kc];B[ge]C[Here I was pleased with myself for seeing this in advance, and expected to clean up.]
;W[ll]C[Yikes. I don't know what's going on anymore.];B[km]
;W[ne]C[Holy cow. Did it have to get this complicated?];B[nf]
;W[oe];B[mf]C[That seemed to be a priority but I didn't like what would follow.]
;W[of]
(;B[ng]C[I really didn't like what was happening but didn't see anything better - was there?

I put down a sort of random variation, but I don't claim that it is anywhere near optimal play.]

;W[nk];B[mk]C[At this point, since I had solidified a big chunk of my wall with an eye, I thought I was doing OK again.

This was a big, necessary move.];W[kk];B[oi]C[That was a rather ambitious move - in retrospect I guess, it have been better to play defensively?

I see this as a defensive move.  If you let white have this move, you are somewhat badly cut up, and I see no future for the big group on the right hand side!]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[hj];B[fk];W[hl];B[gk];W[in]TR[hp][ip][io]C[Egad - I underestimated this. Now it's getting really scary.

Your empty triangle at H4 (marked) now comes back to haunt you!]
;B[im];W[hn];B[go];W[jl]C[Now I get the impression Black is done for.

;W[nd];B[md];W[nc];B[qd];W[mc];B[qc];W[rg]C[Some good stuff here.  You removed a huge chunk of corner territory here.]
;B[pb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[bn]C[Not that it matters at this point, but what good endgame moves are there in the upper left corner? I wanted to play C18 but thought that wasn't the most urgent point. Obviously I mangled this section of the board.

C18 is about the best you can do there, in my opinion.];W[bm]

Well, you have to look a couple of moves ahead here, but it is pretty clear.]
;W[da];B[ba];W[dc];B[ed];W[bc]C[Well at least that last blunder got things over with.

In conclusion:  White did quite well to steal your centre territory, but I think you were aware of most of your blunders without being told.  Good luck in future!]
