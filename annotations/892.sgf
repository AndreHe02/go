White won by resign];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[jd];W[qf];B[qd]
;W[qi]LB[of:A]C[this is really too small a move for white - aiming at a small
side group.   Jumping out at A is much better.];B[qm];W[of]
C[black has started very well.  White's group on the side is cramped
and ineffecient.];B[lq]C[Florreke: Had to play N16 first ?
N16 would probably have been answered, but I don't think it is  strictly necessary.
M3 is a little too big an extension, white should probably invade at r3.]
;W[nc]LB[nd:B][ne:A]
(;B[oc]LB[nd:B][ne:A]C[this move gives black a very cram[ped shape, and makes life easy for  white.  Black should separate white at A or maybe B]
;W[kc];B[lc]C[not good.  the objective should be to keep white's two groups separated]

;B[fq];W[do];B[fo];W[nq];B[pq];W[no];B[jq]LB[lo:A]C[this is too passive.  A would keep up the pressure on white
and make territory more effectively too.];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo]
;B[om]C[this isn't the big move (which is somewhere over on the left side).
Black can't reasonably expect to kill white, who has too much running room.
This move doesn't improve black's territory, and forces white to make
a solid group out of a weak one.];W[mm];B[nr]C[same here, this bridge is too weak, and in any case is unnecessary.  Territory is elsewhere.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[mq];B[lr];W[ko];B[jo];W[nk]C[Florreke: from here on I try to kill the white group underneath.]
;B[nl]C[this is way too small a move.  Even if white can be separated, both sides will live.
The big play is for the left side.];W[ml];B[mk]C[this cut just compounds the error.  Black cannot hope to catch any white
stones with this cut, and so is "born to run" but with nowhere to go.]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[ok];B[dm];W[en];B[dn]C[same thing here - black wants to cut, but white will never permit it
so this move is wasted and makes black heavy.];W[eo];B[co];W[cp]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[fn]LB[ck:A]C[As white I would capitalize on black's poor shape, by attacking at A]
;B[cj]C[good idea for black];W[cg];B[ll]LB[kl:A]C[the capture sequence at A works perfectly well.]

C[black has two huge cut off groups, but is still fixated
on saving every stone.   Black's main hope of salvaging anything
at all is to kill the white cutting group, abnd he has a fair chance
if he starts at A  Of course, the same reasoning applies to white's
move.  Black is already cut off, but won't stay cut off if the white group
near A dies.];B[gn];W[hq];B[ms];W[po];B[oo]C[Florreke: I think Black R5 instead of P5 was better
Exactly.  Just a little effort reading was required.];W[on]

;C[Florreke: Black resigns

Good Move!
Overall, black needs to pay attention to "where will they live" before
committing lots of stones to an attack.  If the attack fails, black's attacking
stones have to live somwhere.    Black got into touble by making forcing moves
that only strenghened white's position.])
