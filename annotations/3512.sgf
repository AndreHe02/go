now judge, what is bad about if you live?
what is good about when you live inside?

Bad, you are locked inside for getting outside.. unless you have stones/ strong groups outside... then you can attack in.

Good, you steal points.. get corners..

direct 3-3 attack is very bad. only when you have stones eg: A to G those areas.
