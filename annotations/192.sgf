;B[pd]C[Dear reviewer,

I'm actually most interested in some comments on fuseki, which i've not played well. as for the middle game, please give some advice on fighting strategy.  (ignore some rather embarrassingly dumb moves, if you please! :))    Thanks for your time and patience!

Cheers,
Ken   In the san ren sei opening it is generally white worrying about black's moyo rather than vice versa.

I think you worry too much about what your opponent is getting. Your opponent is always going to get territory. That is the nature of the game. It is better for you to focus more on expanding your own prospects rather than limiting your opponent's prospects.

It is important to assess the balance of territory a few times during the game. You did not realize that you were way ahead at one point. As a result you fell into unnecessary fighting - a recipe for disaster.   Changing your mind-set about these two issues will lead to an immediate jump in your playing strength.  -Brad]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[i haven't used sanrensei in a long time.  tried it out in this game because i've recently lost a couple of games playing w against b's sanrensei.  was curious to find out how w'd respond.  if possible, please give some advice regarding the sanrensei fuseki in general, for both sides.]
;W[nq]C[Q6 and N3 are both playable.]
(;B[pn];W[jp];B[jd];W[dj];B[fq]C[not sure about the invation.  thought this side's better because i'll mabye have a chance to attack k4-o3 later.  but would it be better to first go for k10?

K10 or thereabouts seems consistent.  F3 is ok too, but your follow-up is incorrect (see next comment).]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq]C[You should play C4. A third line move is better than a 2nd line move.  You should treat F3 as a sacrifice stone. There is a good chance that H3 will become overconcentrated.]

(;B[dr];W[cp];B[br]C[White should play B3 since it is forcing now (but not protect it).]

(;W[fp];B[bp]C[Good.];W[bo];B[eq];W[ep]C[Black is alive. Further moves are "thank you" moves because they increase white's thickness without compensating territorial increase for Black.   Note that Black does not have to answer White G3.]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[hr];W[iq]C[C12 and K10 are alternatives.]
(;B[fc];W[df]C[C12 is not consistent with F17. You made White stronger on the left and then gave him a target.

C17 and K10 are natural. White seems short on territory. When you play K10 it is hard to see how white can make more than 50 or so points on the left even if he answers K10. But you have an imposing structure looming at the top right.]

(;B[ch];W[eh];B[cj];W[ck]C[You cannot afford B10. It would be better to tenuki. Look at the sacrifice strategy with B9.   Strategic concept:
When you are in your opponent's area it is ok to sacrifice LOTS of stones to maintain good shape and forcing prospects. Merely living is usually not enough because your opponent gains both thickness and sente.]

(;B[bj];W[dl]C[If you are going to play B14, just do it now. D13 just becomes a gift.]

(;B[dg];W[eg];B[bf]C[is this a reasonable move?  thought i could either get some eye space *or* go further into the corner.    B14 is ok, but you should not have played D13.

White forgives D13 by taking two moves to capture it. He should play C15 to keep the pressure up on black.]

(;W[cg]C[Here white forgives you for playing D13.];B[bg];W[dh]

(;B[ce];W[ec];B[cc];W[fd];B[gc];W[cd];B[bd];W[cb];B[bb];W[db]

(;B[di]C[bad gote.  should've taken k10 myself?

Right.   Black is alive on the left and in sente! This is a great result considering what could have happened. K10 or N16 are both reasonable.]
;W[ei];B[ci];W[jj]C[You need to protect your top. You cannot handle a white invasion there easily.]

(;B[mo]
(;W[qf]C[would b

N17 is better defense.]
(;B[nc]C[r12 instead of o17?  played o17 because was concerned about the three stones on top.

Good reason though N17 is a little better defense.];W[rd];B[qc]
C[White S17 is poor. White should play R12.]
(;W[rc];B[jn]C[is there another, better place for reducing the w moyo?  (even though i think things turned out well for b here).

Yes, things did turn out well, but I think your move is a little dangerous because white can cut. Since he is strong on the left he should cut to maximize his values.]

(;W[hn];B[im];W[hm];B[ik];W[ij];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl];B[hj]
C[At this point Black has a "won" game. He has more territory AND more power than white. Note that white has two weak groups - the upper right and the two stones in the center.   You should exploit this.]
;W[pr]C[Q13 cuts white off from the center. A follow-up move will limit white to two eyes in the corner in gote.]

(;B[qq];W[ri]C[M3! You should punish white for not completing his shape.  There is a good chance the lower right corner stones will die.]

(;B[rj];W[qi];B[qj];W[mp];B[lo];W[lp]C[The center is huge. Note that white has defended both the top right and the bottom while you have answered all his moves. Now you must attack his remaining group to get compensation. R2 is gote worth less than 10 points. You can play it 100 moves from now.

Note that White R2 is also gote.]
(;B[qr];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl];B[il];W[kk];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[mk]
C[N8 is an eye-stealing tesuji that you should investigate.

The turn at G16 is very large because it helps both the top and the center.]

(;B[nl]C[what'd be a better way to attack this w group, if any?]
;W[mm]C[How about N8 now? O5 is also good shape and denies whithe the tiger's mouth.]

(;B[hh]C[thought about o4 or o5, but decided to grab territory in the center instead...bad idea?

Yes, it is a bad idea. You must harrass the six stones in the center. You will get even more center territory as a result.]
;W[nm]C[Since you went for the center, G4 is more consistent. Locally, P8 is better than P7.]

(;B[om]C[p7 better at p8 (since b can't really cut off w anyway)?

Yes.];W[no];B[pf];W[qg]C[R15 is bad shape. You should view Q14 as a sacrifice stone.]

(;B[qe];W[re];B[lg]C[any suggestion for alternative to l13?  wanted to expand the center, but was a worried about w mobilizing the j10-k10 stones.    See previous comments. G16 is a way to discourage white from running the two stones. Actually, you would like it if they ran, because that would be bad for white. :-)]
;W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[od];W[me];B[nd]C[bad move.  don't think it was byoyomi pressure.  just thoughtless.  b at o13 better?]
;W[mg];B[ne];W[og];B[lm];W[ml];B[ld];W[ol]
(;B[nk]C[would've played q8 and cut my losses had i not fallen to illusions...

O9 could be considered a game losing move. Even if it worked, it is not where you want to play. See the follow-up sequence to Q8 from the previous move. Black is way ahead with no need to fight at all.

This is my last comment. Please re-read my beginning notes at this point.]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[oj];B[ni];W[oi];B[li];W[mi]C[ooooooops!  misread...  had thought n12 would work....]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[ql];W[lf];B[kg];W[kc]C[winning move for w?  (or b's next move the losing move?)  all the way downhill for b after the next move, even though i think b's still comfortably ahead at this point?]
;B[lc];W[ic];B[id];W[hc];B[gd];W[hd];B[he]C[wasn't sure whether f15 first could get the group out to connect to the center and capture the w throw-in stones...]
