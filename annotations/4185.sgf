RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[I am Amygdala, 2k IGS and will mark my comments with "A:".
I will mark the comments of the black player with "B:".
It goes without saying that I can only offer my humble opinion and cannot claim that they render the absolute truth...

B:
I played black in this game, and resigned when things got too complicated to see a way out - even though I had a vague feeling that there were still things to be done, I just couldn't see through all possible variations.

What I am interested in hearing a qualified opinion about are:

- Was my assement right, at the point of resignation, that some kind of miracle was required to get black off the hook? The reason I have to ask is that I have, in the past, at several  times, been able to read myself out of situations that, not just initially, looked completely hopeless.

- #18: White had groups at the lower right corner and the upper right side, that black should have been able to attack more successfully - but how? Not necessarily to capture, but also to leverage for general benefit.

- #53: One grave mistake on black's part - I believe -  was to attack the white invasion at J3 too softly. Black should have played at K4 instead of L5, I think. Is that correct, or was the problem that the previous black move, M3, was too wide?

- #87: Black K18, as an answer to white M17, also feels like a mistake, although at the time I was worried that white would get too much territory at the top. Comments?

- #31: Also, a stone like F17, kind of a leftover from the joseki in the corner - how to use that best? Abandon totally, for aji later, or semi-attach somehow for better effect later?

Of course, comments about other things in the game are appreciated as well.

Thanks for taking the time to review this game!];B[pd];W[pp]

A tasuki fuseki, the basis of a fighting game.];B[qn];W[nq]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[pk]TR[qn][rp]C[A:
The joseki move is Q9. There is no need to vary it here. The shape of the three marked stones looks a little queer.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[A:
This move helps to strengthen the invador. If you want to keep the white stone weak, try not to touch it so early. Instead, the ikken basami at R12 or something like O16 looks better to me.]
;W[pf];B[nc]C[A:
I would prefer the higher move at O16, as it puts slightly more pressure on the white stones.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[pi]
(;B[jd]C[A:
Feels a little lukewarm. Probably you think of the four white stones on the right when you play this, but it does not have any immediate effect on them.
Do you know archery? In this art it is important to keep the string stretched to the very end (the shot: i.e., the end of the game). Try to think similarly of the game of go. K16 is a move without appropriate tension, in a way.
Try to play moves with an immediate impact on the partner, play moves with a purpose. Do not give him time to breathe and to fortify his position.
The variation might be an alternative. In abstract, the rhythm should be: attack the white stone in the upper left corner from the left side, when white extends along the upper edge check that extension from the right side and split the white groups.
Try not to let go the initiative.];W[dj]LB[ql:A]TR[pp][nq][qq]
SQ[pf][qf][pi][qi]C[B:
What are the weaknesses of the marked white groups and how could black use them?

A:
The triangled white group in the lower right corner is not to be called weak. It has a good, resilient shape.
The squared white group at the right side is overconcentrated and vulnerable to attack.
White can, however, still use the aji of A to help his squared stones. Black has to be aware of that option, but he cannot defend there without losing the initiative. Covering the defect with an active approach like that in the variation would erase potential and contradict the proverb  "Do not touch weak stones."
Of course, in the end you have to touch them, e.g. if you have to kill them, but it is good advice to threaten weak stones from a distance.
Sooner or later, the four square-marked stones will become a burden four white anyway.]

(;B[fc]SQ[pf][qf][pi][qi]C[A:
I like this move. It has an immediate impact on white, extends the upper black moyo and threatens the four squared white stones from a distance. Very good!]
;W[hc]
(;B[cc]C[A:
It is better to keep the white stones separated as in the variation. H17 is unreasonable and you have to prove it.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de]C[A:
Joseki is the variation.]
(;B[ce];W[cf];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
(;B[fe]TR[fc]C[B:
In hindsight, F15 at H15 instead would have been more efficient. But in general, how to make best use of the F17 stone?

A:
H15 instead does not look good either, white could ignore it. Once more, I would leave it for later and not use it immediately. In a sense, the triangled black stone is a weak one, and as you have already learnt, you should not touch it. 
Instead of F15, I would probably have played the variation first.]
;W[ef];B[he];W[gd];B[cl]C[A:
Fine. The option of a white invasion at san-san should not bother black, because he will gain a lot of influence in return. There is even a proverb that says "Welcome the invasion at the three-three point!".]

(;B[fq]SQ[dn][do][dp][dq]C[A:
With a wall like that of the squared stones, such a docile defensive move is unnecessary. I would prefer the variation instead.]

(;W[bm];B[cm];W[bn];B[lq]C[A:
Very good. This is the right distance to the black wall and is sente against the white group. Due to white's mistake with B7, the result for black is better than could be expected.]
;W[iq]
(;B[ko]LB[jp:A]C[B:
Better for black to attack at "A", or was the M3 stone wronlgy placed?

A:
The M3 stone was fine. The white invasion is unreasonable. It is too close to the black wall. Whatever happens will be good for black. I would prefer the ikken tobi like in the variation. That is both simple and strong. The black move L5 does not look like the proper shape here. The keima with K5 would be correct if M3 was at L3.]
;W[io];B[jm]C[A:
Now the keima is fine. "Chase with the keima, escape with ikken tobi!".]

White knows his proverbs as well.];B[il];W[hm];B[hl];W[jl]

Better at K6, because that threatens a cut.];W[gl];B[gm];W[fl]

(;B[ik]C[A:
Black will never play that again, please: the empty triangle, epitome of bad shape. In 999 out of thousand cases, do not even think of it. Very rarely, of course, it can be the only move. Everything depends on circumstances. In the case of the black player: never do it again. Bad shape will always haunt you for the rest of the game. I would prefer H10 instead.]

Would not be possible if there had been played a black stone at K6 instead of L7.]

Looks a little helpless and has hardly any effect on anything. I would prefer O14 as in the variation.]

Better placement of the black K18 stone? At "A" or "B", perhaps?

A:
My choice would be K17! That is strong and leaves no aji. See the variations. In fact, the white invasion is unreasonable again.]

Well done, good shape.];W[lg];B[nf]C[A:

Indeed, you are behind in territory and you cannot make the difference up in an ordinary endgame. In the game of Go, resigning is an art of its own. When did you last listened to Mozart's 40th symphony, for instance? It does not just end - it offers a lot of tension before the last accord. Before the resignation, you shoul try something spectecular, even if you have already read out that it does not work. The last remaining white group that is open to attack are the squared white stones. Attack them before resigning! I suggest the sequence which I added as one of many branches.

I think I tried to answer all your specific questions in the course of reviewing the game.
In the end and as a summary some few specific inspirations for you:
1. Never ease the pressure on your partner (#17,61).
2. Never play moves without immediate impact (#17,61).
3. Separate the other's stones (#21), link your own groups.
4. Never play the empty triangle (#65).
5. Do not touch weak stones and groups (#11,31).
6. Attack weak groups from the outside first (#119).
7. When you have decided to resign, always try something spectecular first.

I enjoyed the review very much and I hope that it will help you. If so, I would be glad to hear about it.]
