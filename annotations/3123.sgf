C[Both players are ranked 18k on KGS.

By the end of the game it was clear that black was much stronger than 18k (actually closer to 10k, according to his profile).

I thought my play was OK, without major mistakes, and yet I lost. Perhaps the reviewer can help me understand why.  I've commented and questioned a few of the moves myself.  Thanks for your help!

Xif: Hi I am David (Xif on KGS), I hope I can answer all your questions. I will proceed all my comments with Xif:. If you have any questions please feel free to email me back.]

C[Black 7 was not a good move (not big enough, and too easy to pincer).  In hindsight c10 or r10 would have been better, maybe even n3 or o3.

But I was really surprised by white's  capping move.

Xif: I wouldn't say black seven is a bad move and is still quite big however its about an 7 out of 10 move versus a 10 out of 10 move. Personally I would of played Q10, but that is beside the point. You responded quite soft to white which makes it a bad move. Generally you want to hane (definition here http://senseis.xmp.net/?Hane ) a touched stone as a response.]

Black 39 looks a lot bigger to me now than it did at the time. Perhaps I should have pressed into the center instead of playing on the right side?

Xif: no this move is quite good becuase A: it limits whites territory a B: it develops the center a by allowing you to have two stones instead of one to work with. C. It forces white to respond to your move]

But maybe I should have invaded at c3 instead, hoping either to connect with my left-side group or expand towards the f3 area.

Xif: Definitly C3. It reduces white and increases your own territory. It is about a twenty point swing since your adding about five points to your score and taking away 15 of his.]
