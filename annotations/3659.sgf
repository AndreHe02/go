C[Hi!

Here, late as usual, some comments on your game. I hope they are of some help!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[po];B[np]LB[pl:C][qm:B][qo:A]
C[For starters, here.
Which move should have been the best for black? The one I played? Or some other?

Could u show me a joseki if I played a move around q8 ?

----

There are very few professional games with your move. Much more popular is the move at A; The pincers B and C are also possible. If you have some time, how about searching in a database like www.gobase.org for some examples?!]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk]LB[ce:B][on:C][fq:A]C[Instead of B (your move), A also looks interesting now. That move is a good continuation from your joseki at the bottom right, and because of the wide extension (the marked white stone), Black can develop the lower side further by playing at C which is almost always sente.]
;B[ce];W[dh]LB[bc:B][df:A]C[Now, BA is better than your move at B (see Variation).]

(;B[bc];W[gc];B[qi]C[A good point!];W[ok];B[pl]C[Hm... I can't reject this, but it feels like Black tries to hard here?!]
;W[pk];B[on]LB[ql:A][oo:B]C[Now, Wa is alt least simpler (if not better) than the actual move at B (see variation)]

(;W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[nm];W[mn];B[ol];W[pn];B[ql]C[A courageous move!]
;W[om];B[nk]LB[oi:C][pi:B][nj:A]C[Now, the White move at A is a mistake. Sometimes B is a possibility, but I don't think it works well here; so, White should play the simple move at C (see variations).]

(;W[nj]C[This just don't work.];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[pi];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[ni];W[qh];B[pg];W[ri];B[rk]C[Game over.... Basically, there is nothing more to comment now, so I will give only some short comments on the remaining moves.]
;W[qj];B[rj];W[qi];B[qg];W[mj];B[rh]C[This was of course worse than playing for example on n11

Of course :)];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[si];W[mf];B[cn];W[cl]LB[en:B]
[bp:A]C[The game move A is bad now; After that, it's hard for Black to make a base. I would prefer B immediately.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[en];W[fp];B[hq]C[too hard.];W[fn]LB[go:A]C[better at A.]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[fm];B[ck]C[wow :) But the black stones are still quite weak.]
;W[bk];B[dk];W[bm];B[dl];W[cj];B[ci];W[di]LB[dj:A]C[bad, white should play at A instead.]
;B[bj];W[dj];B[bh];W[ch];B[bi];W[bn];B[co];W[bg];B[bf]C[now black has more territory and no weak stones.]
;W[cg];B[ag];W[ah];B[ai];W[ak]
(;B[bl]LB[af:A]C[This is very bad, allowing White to live. Connecting at A instead kills White, I think?! (see variation).]
;W[al];B[af];W[cm];B[cp];W[bo];B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[ep];B[cr]
;W[jq];B[cb]C[This was a bad move ?

---

I don't think so; May be it's not best, but making a base for not-so-secure stones is never bad :)]

Hard to say, both are big . but  I think I would have played f17.]

;W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[ne]C[B won by resign.

I know i did 2 mistakes killing the big white group in the bottom.  Can you review please(especially the opening)? Thanks !

This was a game with many tactial mistakes, often involving life and death, but nonetheless Black earned are well deserved victory.

Good luck with your next games!])

(;B[df];W[fd];B[bc];W[jc]C[This is a time honored joseki. Compared to the game, the black position is not so low, and White can't shut in Black easily, which also means he can't connect the white positions easily.]
