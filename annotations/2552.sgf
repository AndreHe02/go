C[crux: Hi, my name is Bernd Schmidt; I'm around 2d at my local club.  Please use an sgf reader that clearly shows which moves have variations.  I recommend qgo, gGo, cgoban1 or jago.  There are some problems with cgoban2, the KGS client.]
;B[pd]C[Hi!
As this is my best level of playing, I would appreciate any comments on my game style and where I could play better. I've lost about 20 points in gote - that's why I've lost.]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[jd];W[qi]C[crux: Here, I'd consider an approach move in the lower right corner - see example variation.]

(;B[co]C[crux: Maybe a little overaggressive.  No need to go invading that early; while you succeed in making this stone live, you also damage the left side in the process.]

;W[di];B[dh];W[ei];B[bh];W[bg];B[bj];W[eh];B[ek]C[crux: This may be a bit premature.  This move says "I'm going to move out", but in the end the two stones are just swallowed up by White and become wasted.]

(;B[qk]C[crux: I don't think this is a very good invasion.  White isn't threatening to make that much territory there.  See variations for some suggestions.]
;W[qn]C[crux: Very good answer.];B[pr];W[or]C[Could I win the corner?

crux: Not exactly a standard life-and death problem after W T2, but I think Black has little to worry about.]
;B[qr]
(;W[sr];B[rn];W[rm]
(;B[sn]C[crux: This move seems a little dangerous, but even so I can't imagine the worst case being anything other than seki.]
;W[sp];B[rq]C[crux: Now White can kill.]
(;W[sm];B[ro];W[sq]
(;B[rr];W[ps];B[qs];W[nq]C[crux: This is now a tricky situation.  If there was a white stone at P1, it would be a standard thousand-year ko.  This means: whoever starts the ko is at a disadvantage, since the opponent gets to take the ko first (having to find the first ko threat is a burden), and because he has to ignore a ko threat to fill an internal liberty.  Hence, there is a good chance that no one will start the ko.  

Without the stone at P1, it seems like Black can live in double ko.

In the variations, ko threats go into the upper left corner for illustration purposes.  (Note, there are two variations, one starting with a Black passing).]

(;B[rp]C[crux: Bad, because the exchange of this move for P1 turns the corner into a better ko for White, and Black needs to add another stone.]
;W[os]C[I didn't want to start komi at T1 and I didn't want to give a chance to W

crux: "ko", not "komi".];B[rs]TR[rp]C[crux: The marked stone now serves no purpose.  Black loses a full move.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]
(;B[ok]C[crux: It seems like these two stones are going to be weaker than the white groups surrounding them.  It may not be such a good idea to pull the lone stone just now.  The group on the lower side doesn't have two clear eyes yet either.]
