C[In this game I sacrificed a many stones and gave my opponent a lot of territory in order to build up a big moyo. I would be particularly interested in hearing which of these sacrifices of stones and territory where appropriate and which not,  and which moves  I missed that would have suited my strategy of building a big moyo. Also: after the opponent invaded at the end, should I have given him a small territory in the corner instead of trying to kill all?

Jay: I will be happy to help.];B[dc]C[Tana [5k\]: OK];W[qp]
;B[dq];W[pc];B[oq];W[jc];B[pn]C[would D5 have been bettter here?

Jay: It's hard to say.  Personally, I would prefer D5 rather than Q6. Playing Q6 develops into the center quickly, while the D3 stone is not as helpful in this development.  Also, the wide deployment of D3 and D17 invites W's invasions and complicated fighting situations.  There would be too many groups for B to take care.]
;W[op];B[pp]C[Is this move allright?];W[po];B[pq];W[qo]
(;B[np];W[oo]C[This result seemed much better for white

Jay: Certainly, B's Q6 stone is poorly positioned. See variation.]

(;B[pe]C[would R12 have been a better idea?

Jay: R12 is not as good as your play.];W[ph]C[I felt very uncomfortable here.

Jay: B needs to settle quickly.  Your next few moves are ok.]

;B[md];W[mb];B[of];W[na];B[ne];W[od];B[oe];W[oa]C[This result seemes locally much better for white, but black has sente to go elsewhere, so was the result ok for black? What should he have done to get a locally decent result?

Jay: It is not as bad as it appears.  What's important is the sente you have gained.  Locally, better result can be achieved as shown by variation.]
;B[co];W[pk];B[jq]C[Here I felt comfortable again. But what is the status at this point?

Jay: To my taste W's earlier move at Q9 is a bit slow. It should be played at D11 or an invasion at L4, etc.  But, at this point the game is about even. One could envision that B has taken one solid corner and somewhat the lower side plus a few stones at P15, and W has taken two half corners and one solid side, and B just played a move at D17.  Now it's W's turn to move.    From the overall situation, B has slight burden with a few stones at P15 potentially at risk.  

B's K3 is a bit strange though: As an influence move it is clearly better at K4.  As an extension it is one space too far from D3.  As a protection for the cut at O3, it is two space too far from O3.  For lack of better result, it would be better to play lightly at D15 to take LU corner.  When invaded or attacked B can strengthen its weak group at P3.]
;W[qq]C[Jay: W did not hesitate to explore B's weakness at O3.]
;B[no]C[This move seems far too small.  D15 was probably much bigger.

Jay: This move develops into the center, and helps to protect the cut at O3. D15 should be played a bit earlier.]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[nn]C[Somehow the sacrifice of the three stones seems allright. Was it?

Jay: It is ok under the circumstance.  The game is still pretty even up to this point.]
;W[de];B[dh]C[This move I thought was very good. Was I mistaken?

Jay: This is bit too loose.  B's D17 stone needs urgent help.  I would play C13 or D13.]

(;W[dg]C[Jay: W's this play is not good.  It strengthens B's position at D12 for no apparent reasons.  If W had played C17, or even jumped at F15, B would be difficult to handle at UL.]
;B[cg]C[I considered C12 for a long time ...

Jay: This move is better than C12.];W[cf];B[eg];W[ef]
(;B[cd]C[was I too timid? Should I have played C12 first? Or E12?

Jay: Definitely, you should not avoid the ko fight. See variation.]

Jay: W could'v done better as shown by variation. You are lucky here.]
;B[oi]C[Probably not the right spot?

Jay: This is a good and timely help for P15 group. This group has always been a liability for B so far.]

;W[ml];B[nl];W[om];B[ll]C[I could probably have played M7 here. But the sacrifice of the three stones was deliberate. Was the sacrifice allright?

Studying life and death problems should help you get stronger.  This is reflected by your lack of desire to get involved with fighting unless forced.
