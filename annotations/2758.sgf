C[Dear reviewer! Thank you in advance for helping with this game. My name is Anton and I play as black in this game. This one was lost by a few points because of several mindless mistakes that I made. Nevertheless, it represents my "average" game, that is why I would like to see it commented, for what thinking and moves are not correct, and what is good in it. I have added some comments of my own, mostly commenting on what I think are errors, with questions on what would be better. Thanks!

REV: I will do my best to point out what I think you could have done better.  Some of the questions you posed, I was not sure about.  If you decide to have the review reviewed (yes, you can do that!), please send me the review, so that I can also learn.

C[Anton: In this case, would c10 be better in the light of stone on upper-right hoshi?

REV: Actually, according to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, C10 is not joseki.  I am very bad at
openings, but I guess it's because of possibility for attack around C8.]
;W[lq]
(;B[pj]C[Anton: This feels both too high (r10 better?) and unrelated to the rest of black's stones. Would securing the corner with p17 be too slow and unambitious at this point in the game?

REV: I agree that this stone looks high, but let's have a look at your options.
I don't think there is anything basically wrong with P17, except that then your shimari is looking at white's strength, leading white to a natural extension around R10.  This is then exactly where you played, which fits with the principle of playing where your opponent wants to play.  Another possibility would be somewhere near K16, leading to a nice sente pincer if white decided to play a kakari against R16 (see variation).  Note that you don't have to know the joseki to see this.  There are a whole slew of variations, I just picked two to demonstrate what some possible reasonable lines might have been rendered unreasonable with an extra stone in place.]
;W[ql];B[qj];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cg]C[REV: I'm not quite sure why I don't like this move.  Maybe because it looks like a compromise between responding to the local situation and attending to strategic questions.  But I still can't say directly why it's bad, so maybe it's all right.  Sorry for the waffle!]
;W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[pf];W[kc];B[gc];W[dk];B[cj];W[di];B[ch]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[jj]C[REV: Now you seem to be behind, so you have to make sure that white doesn't get all the territory that he is trying to claim.]
;B[nq]SQ[ql]LB[pn:A][qq:B][iq:C]C[Anton: This one looks a total mistake -  a desperate invasion by placing a stone into the pincer with the next move being white's. Where would be a mere realistic invasion spot? or should black start erasing white's moyo by something like k15 or o9?

REV: I would consider Q6 (A), as it puts pressure on Q4 (square), looking at attacking the corner.  
The 3,3 invasion at B, of course, is silly, as it builds up white's influence nicely.  I would guess that a move around J3 (C) might make sense, but I wouldn't know how to follow it up.]
;W[oq];B[no];W[pn];B[ol]SQ[pj][qj]LB[lp:A]C[REV: I think you are trying to forge a connection to your stones at Q10 (squares).  This is a mistake, as you can't be sure that you can make it.  Rather build up influence by playing something like M4 (A).  The threat of a connection to the outside is still there, and you might use it later, but there is plenty of room to live in the center if you can make white's stones weak.]
;W[nn];B[nf]C[Anton: Now I would play somewhere along m14 or m13 and connect to the left or escape to the right depending on reply.

REV: I'm not sure exactly what you mean here.  I don't think your stones at the bottom are dead yet, and if white manages to kill them, you're in trouble.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[ne];W[nd];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[dj]
;W[ei];B[ml]SQ[ci][di][ei]C[REV: After you played D10, I would expect you to continue at E10.  If white considered D10 to be sente, he must surely respond to E10?  If you attack the three white stones around D11 (squares), you will either kill them or at least get a large attack on white's moyo at the bottom.]
;W[jl];B[mn];W[on];B[jn]SQ[nq][no]LB[lo:A][mo:B]TR[mp]C[Anton: Not sure what I was thinking here, though this does end up connected to a live group.

REV: After white lets you connect your stones at O3,5 (squares), I think it would be wise to secure the connection by playing M5 or N5 (A-B).  N5 looks better, as it connects O3 without leaving white the peep at N4 (Triangle)]
;W[mo]C[Anton: I would play o7 if I were white, yet that would probably mean potential of black's bottom centre surliving on its own... Not sure which is best for white.

REV: I think it is good for white to kill your stones at O3,5.  He can still play the 3,3 invasion at C17, so he should still win.]
;B[lo];W[mp];B[lm]C[Anton: m6 better?

REV: How about N7?
Anyway, any connection there is big for black, as you are threatening something around K4.]
;W[ej];B[dn]C[Anton: silly me...
REV: This was expensive, indeed.];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[bq];W[cr]
;B[br];W[bj];B[ai]LB[bh:A]C[REV: Maybe better to just connect at B12 (A).  Then white's sagari is not sente.]
;W[aj];B[bg];W[en];B[cp];W[do];B[jc]C[Anton: This is probably a good place for an "urgent before big" remark.

REV: Play urgent moves before big moves. :-)];W[co];B[bo];W[am]
;B[bs];W[bn];B[ar];W[ao];B[ap];W[jp];B[jm]C[Anton: k6 looks solid enough, so black could have gone further left instead.
REV: I agree.];W[hm];B[hn];W[gn];B[ho];W[hp];B[qq]C[Anton: Most of my recent games show me that I can't always live by invading san-san. Is white p3 the reason, or did I make a mistake at some point in this corner?

REV: This looks like a tricky invasion, because, as you say, of P3.  I think it should die, but I guess only a stronger player than myself could say for sure.]
;W[qp];B[rq];W[rp];B[pr];W[or]C[Anton: r1 - s2, or s1-t2 - all looks bad by now. Was there a chance at all?
REV: Seems bad.];B[rr];W[qs];B[ps];W[rs]C[Anton: actually would t3-t1 turn this into a seki? I didn't see this at the time (though I understand that black Q2 is also needed for it to be a seki).
REV: If I understand it correctly, this is the famous bent four in the corner shape.  See the variation:  Assume that white first removes all your ko threats at the end of the game.  You obviously can't attack, as you simply die, and white can attack to make a ko that you can't win.  This is judged to be dead under Japanese rules, otherwise white is forced to play some stones to show that it is dead, and black gains.  I am not sure what the current opinion is of this ruling, but the fact remains that black can't live.]

Anton: Apparently, game result isn't added to SGF on little golem. Score:
  White: 78 (area) + 23 (prisoners) + 6.5 (komi) = 107.5 points
  Black: 85 (area) + 20 (prisoners) = 105 points
  White win by 2.5 points.
So it was decided by the mistakes that I made, yet this game is "averagely" my style, this is why I wanted to get comments on it.]
