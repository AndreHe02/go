RE[W+Resign]

C[Alex: Hi, thanks for reviewing my game.  I was playing black.

After move 56 I had given up a lot of territory, in exchange for being able to attack a weak group.  I thought this was a fair trade, but I lost because I didn't know how to attack properly.  Can you tell me whether you agree with this?

;W[eo]LB[fo:a]C[Alex: I've never seen this move before, and I'm sure it can't be joseki!  What is the best response?  I thought about playing 'a' (F5), but chose something different instead...

-----
klin: Play at a is normal.];B[dn];W[ep];B[cn];W[dq];B[ch]C[klin: Not too bad.]

;W[jd]TR[qo][po][op]LB[qm:a]C[Alex: Here I wasn't sure of the right direction.  I wanted to attack the white stones at R5, but 'a' (R7) felt too small.

-----
klin: To attack, from N5 direction is better.  If W R8, B P11 and be happy.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[ln];W[mr];B[ko]C[Alex: Things got a lot messier than I expected!  Is there a better move instead of L5?

-----];W[mo];B[mp]C[klin: B N4 not good. Should M5 simple.  B can fight if W cuts.]
;W[mn];B[jo];W[ip];B[km];W[pq];B[pp];W[np]C[klin: Now B still should connect at N3. W cannot cut at M5 now.]
;B[mm];W[mq];B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[or];B[ro]C[klin: This result is acceptable.  But B lost the target of attack.]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[nr];B[qn];W[ml];B[lm];W[om];B[pn];W[oj]C[Alex: This is where I think things started to go wrong for me.  I was happy to give away the corner, because I thought I had a lot of potential on the outside, but then I wasn't sure of the best way to attack the white stones in the centre.

-----];B[nk];W[nl];B[ph]C[klin: B should P9 now.  W's O8 connect made the group haevy.]
;W[ok]C[klin: W is off the hook by geeting P9.];B[kj];W[mj]
;B[lk];W[mk];B[ni];W[nj]
(;B[pl]C[Alex: I wondered if I should have played M12 instead.  See variation.

-----
klin: B's attack is too anious.  It is a good time to play at M16.  If W reinforce the center, B H17 invades.  I think B has the advantage in territory.  If W plays on the up side, now B Q8 attack is more serious to W.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[oi];B[oh];W[lh];B[nh];W[lj];B[ki];W[ll];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[mh]C[Alex: I feel as though this is still a close game.  Black's right side is about the same size as white's lower side (maybe slightly smaller, as white has more chances to reduce or invade), so if I can find a good way of reducing the top then I can still win?

-----
klin: B is not bad.];B[ec];W[jg];B[dd]C[klin: B D16 at D18 better.]
;W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[hc];W[ed];B[fc];W[od];B[pc];W[qi]C[Alex: I think I made some mistakes responding to this move.

-----
klin: This where B pays the price of attacking too aniously.  Now that W has escaped, B can give up Q9 Q8 two stones.]
;B[pj]C[klin: See the comment of the last move. B Q10 should play Q11.]

;W[bb];B[ba];W[ab];B[ee]LB[ei:a]C[Alex: This seemed like a good idea at the time, but it didn't really achieve much.  What would you play instead?  Is 'a' (E11) too slow?

-----
klin: No,a is not too slow.  Now that the center W becomes stronger, B should protect its terriotry.  But E15 is playable.]
;W[de];B[fe];W[gb];B[hb]C[klin: B this move is bad and leaves an obvious double peak at G16.  B should G16 connect, or B 14 attack directly.  W has no time to play on the up side.]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[fd]C[klin: B failed completely here.];B[fb]C[klin: and gote]
;W[di]C[Alex: I've achieved my goal of reducing the top, but my stones on the left side turned out to be weaker than I expected.  White's move at D11 was a surprise.  What is the best response?

-----
klin: D12 absolutely.];B[ci];W[ek];B[gi]LB[cj:a]C[Alex: I think G11 was a mistake--this is where everything starts to collapse.  Would 'a' (C10) have been better?

-----
klin: I don't see G11 that bad.];W[fi];B[gh];W[cj]TR[ch][ci]
[en][dn][cn]C[Alex: Now I can't find any way to avoid losing either the C11 or the D6 stones.

-----];B[dh];W[ei];B[bj];W[ck];B[dk]C[klin: This is a typical bad move.  Should reserve.]
;W[dj];B[bk]C[klin: Now, after D9, B should play at C8. W B9, B E13.  B can fight.  You cannot alway think you can kill your opponent's group.

klin: No comment beyond this point.];W[cl];B[el];W[fk];B[bo]
;W[bm];B[eg];W[bn];B[co];W[bp]
(;B[ao]C[Alex: I considered G7 instead, but I don't think it works.  See variation.

-----];W[gm]C[Alex: From here on, it's very ugly!  You don't need to comment on the last few moves...

(;C[klin: B not bad this way.  But the reason is W Q8 too passive.  W may play at P12 and see what B does.]
