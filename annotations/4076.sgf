C[I played black. I put some comments, overall I think I should have played more solid.

[teabing\]: I answered your questions and also added some other sugestions.]

LB[fp:A]C[[teabing\]: White didn't play A. This may not be necesary now, but at some point this is dangerous. I showed a variation later in the game.]

(;B[id]TR[fc][fe]C[[teabing\]: I'm not sure of this move. It turned out OK, but it could be realy bad. I would play D18 to strenghten the two stones. You probably didn't want to leave L16 alone, but I think it's too early too decide what to do with it. It might be worth to sacrifice the stone to gain influence.]

(;W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[hd];W[nq];B[pm]LB[qj:B][pn:A]TR[qi]C[[teabing\]: This is considered too loose. You probably played if instead of A because the marked stone wasn't at B.]

(;B[dh]LB[kr:A]TR[kp]C[I though I could break the ladder or at least make some influence to the center.

[teabing\]: It is possible. See the variation

[teabing\]: another way to use the marked stone was by playing at A. See the variation.]
;W[ch];B[ko]C[[teabing\]: This is a mistake but i'm sure you know that. The ladder works. This mistake is worth many points. When these two stones will be killed white will have much more influence then if just L4 was killed. It's important to read as far as you can in such key moments.]
;W[kn];B[dg];W[cg];B[ef];W[de];B[di];W[jo]C[[teabing\]: The influence you gained here can be only turned to territory. You won't be able to use it to attack because white doesn't have any weak groups.]

Now I would use it to strenghten the upper left stones.]))
