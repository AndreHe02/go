C[Hi,

this is my last game on the Frankfurt GO-Tournament 2004.

I'm mainly interested where my biggest mistakes where.

My GO-Pals tell me that i'm not playing aggresive enough, so it would be nice, if you could point out some moves that should/could have been more aggresive. ;-)


Ness - Well, I'm not a big fan of aggressive play.  Certainly it's important at times, but I think that an aggressive attitude leads one away from *balance* which is the key to go.

Now that I've reviewed the game, I think your main problem is like most players at your strength: watch out for little groups that determine the fate of larger ones, like the key stones at G13 and the little stone at S15.  Notice what's dying :)]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq]C[white: i decided to attack the san-ren-sei from the outside. Securing the lower left corner felt too slow.

n - Don't think it matters much :)];B[pn];W[kq];B[jd];W[dj]
;B[ep];W[dn]C[white: as always i was afraid of loosing my large scale mojo on the left.

n - you have no moyo, just some outward-facing stones.];B[cq]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[eo];B[fp];W[hq];B[fo];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[ho]
;W[pr]C[white: i prepared an attack in the upper right corner and wanted to make the base of my lower stones a bit bigger. i thought making more base in sente was a good idea.]
;B[qq];W[qf]C[white: i decided to attack from the right, because i was afraid of a large black mojo there.

n - sure.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[qi];B[qj]
;W[nf];B[gc]C[n - B should keep attacking, the W group is not stable]
;W[lc]C[white: getting nervous and having the sayings of my friend in mind of being a passive player, i decided to do something crazy. Because i'm not so experienced in invading an reducing, i thought even if it doesn't work, i could sacrifice this "invasion" and build some influence to the center.

n - You are inviting a splitting attack, which is something never to do.  When you have a weak group, the last thing you want is another weak group (a sacrifice stone is different).]
;B[ld]LB[mc:A]C[n - I think A is better];W[md]C[white: still unsure if the invasion works, i prepared to slip to the outside.

n - You're in trouble.];B[mc]C[n - wrong side, now you have a chance to get the initiative back.]
;W[me];B[kc];W[lb]C[white: i heard adding a sacrifice stone helps to keep my opponent busy while i could make some forcing moves on the outside.

n - This is not the situation for adding a sacrifice stone.  You are just inviting B to grow strong.]
;B[nc]C[n - W is far behind.];W[le];B[kd];W[ec]C[white: preparing for an invasion on H17 oder J17 and adding more security to the corner.

n - You should strengthen your weak center group, it is almost dead.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[rf]LB[rh:A]C[n - too fancy.  If B plays A instead, W is in bad trouble.]
;W[rg];B[pi];W[oh]C[white: didn't want to get shut in.

n - Good shape.];B[rh];W[qg];B[ri]LB[re:A]C[n - Because of the bad move at A, you have gained an eye in sente.]
;W[dg]LB[hc:A][ic:B][lc:C]C[white: still preparing to jump into H17 or J17.

n - These are bad moves because your two stones at C are dead.]
;B[bp]C[white: actually i wanted to get this big point. missed the right timing. :-(

n - This is smaller than the center.];W[co];B[oq];W[ic]LB[or:A]
C[white: i played J17 because i wanted to make use of the aji of the M17-stones.

n - too aggressive :)  A is a big point I think.];B[hd];W[id]
;B[ie];W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[kf]C[white: noted that my invasion was a miscalculation :-(]
;W[jg];B[hc]LB[he:A]C[n - I think A is better.  You can cut at A and play the ladder.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[hf]C[n - Just take the stone.  You don't have an eye anyway, and you let B connect below.]
;B[gf]C[n - but he missed the chance.];W[ib]C[n - Good.  This is huge, maybe 60 points.  Now your group is safe and B is in trouble.]
;B[kb];W[fd];B[hg];W[if];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[gd]C[n - B is toast.]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[de];W[cd];B[ce]LB[gd:A];W[bd];B[eh];W[dh];B[ei]
;W[di];B[ej];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[ek];W[dk]C[white: played to fast. as soon as my fingers left this stone, i realized that i could have played it on D8. :-(

n - It seems fine like this.];B[el]LB[hi:A]C[n - If you play A, how will black live?]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[cl];B[hk];W[gm];B[hm];W[in]LB[hh:B][hi:C][hl:A]
C[white: a kakashi-experiment. :-)

n - You are wasting the potential at A, which separates the B stones in the middle.  A black move at B would be huge now, so you should play C.]
;B[hn];W[ip]C[white: i thought it was a good idea to secure the lower mojo, while threatening to connect to my kakashi-move on J6.

n - slow move.  What you have on the bottom is not a moyo, it is about eight or ten points of territory.]
;B[io];W[jo];B[jn];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[ln];W[hi];B[jj];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[bf];B[jh];W[kg]LB[re:B][hg:A]C[white: i was obsessed to shut in the black L16 group. Afraid that it could push itself into the center. While i'm reviewing this game right now, i think it might have been much better to advance into the center by myself.
Maybe with O10 or even deeper?

n - you must kill the cutting stone at A, and hope that black does not think to kill your group by taking at B.]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[ih];W[lg];B[mi]C[n - W should resign.];W[hh]
;B[ig];W[ij]C[white: there must have been insufficient oxygen in the tournament room ;-)
I have absolutely no idea what i had in mind with this move.]
;B[ik];W[kh];B[ji];W[gk];B[gj];W[fj];B[gl];W[fl];B[fk];W[ni]
;B[nj];W[ki];B[kj];W[lj];B[lk];W[mj];B[mk];W[li];B[oi];W[mn]
;B[mo];W[mp]C[white: again one of my passive moves. could have played O5.

n - yes, that's big.];B[no];W[or]C[n - This is almost as big though.]
;B[np];W[mr];B[qr];W[mh];B[cf];W[cg];B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[bm]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[fr];W[hr];B[hp];W[jq];B[be];W[ae];B[em];W[en]
;B[oe];W[eg]C[white: lucky me ;-)];B[fh];W[ff];B[gi];W[fs];B[er]
C[white: now i thought winning should be easy and tried to play the big endgame moves in sente.

n - score estimator has you +3.5.];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps];B[rr];W[ja]
;B[la];W[ka];B[mb];W[pq];B[hj];W[fe];B[ii];W[gf];B[jb];W[ia]
;B[of];W[og];B[es];W[gs];B[se]C[n - very big move, B is now ahead.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[sg];B[sf];W[op];B[oo];W[sh]C[white: i didn't see the danger that was lurking here. :-(]
;B[ng]C[white: :'-(];W[nh];B[si];W[pg];B[mg];W[oq]C[white: now i totally lost my nerves. Didn't see the opportunity with R4]
