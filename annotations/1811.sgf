C[forfun (ff) - Thanks for providing an interesting game for analysis.  In this game White builds a large framework at an early stage.  Black does not manage to keep the game balanced and gets pushed around just a bit.  As a result White builds up an early lead.  Black's last good chance is to attack strongly when White invades the upper side.

Black would benefit from developing a better sense of the overall balance of the game (who is ahead and which directions hold the best prospects).  It also felt like Black played some standard moves at times without realizing that White could take advantage in the particular position of the game.  To improve this Black should strive to give more careful consideration to what answers are available to White and what sorts of uncoventional replies might be used against the standard play.  In this case at least, Black played a rather reactive game.  While this is not unusual in facing a stronger player, we have to learn to overcome the tendency to accept the opponent's ideas.  We have to remember that Go is fundamentally a competition.  Generally if we are in a quiet game, someone isn't pushing hard enough :-)]
;B[qd];W[pp]C[domi [2d\]: well 14p behind];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[jp]C[ff - A little unusual.  More typically the pros as White choose to approach the upper right at P16.]
;B[kd]C[ff - More usual is to enclose the upper right corner with P17 or P18 but this type of larger-scale play is certainly possible.  When Black plays on the upper side in this position, the low move at L17 instead has been played by the pros.  L16 seems a little inconsistent with the enclosure in the upper left.  It looks like the stone at C15 would be better at D15 in order to fight harder on the upper side.]
;W[dj]C[ff - There are a couple of pro games with the L16 stone on L17 where White plays this move at Q13 and after Black answers at P16 White plays Q10.  Since Black has the low stone at C15 in the upper left, this play feels slower than playing on the right.]
;B[pj];W[jj]
(;B[qn]C[ff - This is one of the rare occasions when the high approach move at Q6 looks better than R6.  The usual move at R6 is begging to be pushed down.  See the variations.]
;W[on]
(;B[pl]C[ff - This is a terribly slow looking move.  If the White stone at K10 and the Black stone at Q10 were not on the board, this would be one standard reply to P6.  However, in this situation it is way over-concentrated with Q10 while White is quickly building a huge framework.  See the variations.]
;W[qo]C[ff - White immdeiately makes the Q8 stone over-concentrated and walls off a large corner territory.  However, Black has to cooperate to make this as successful as it was.]
;B[pn];W[po]C[ff - The exchange of Q6 for Q5 seals the corner for White.  There is still the aji of the cutting point at P5.  Black should be thinking how to utilize that aji.  Meanwhile the Black stones are secure.  They can still be threatened from around R12 but White needs more support in the upper right before that becomes a serious threat.]

(;B[om]C[ff - This is not a good idea.  Black pushes out from strong stones, forcing White to build five lines of solid territory in the bottom right.]
;W[nn];B[ml];W[lm]
(;B[od]C[ff - This looks slow.  White's framework is very large.  It looks like Black must limit is somehow.  If we look at the board as a whole the clump of Black stones on the right side look overcrowded and do not seem to be achieving much.  See the variations.]
;W[ll];B[cn]C[ff - This is again too conventional.  By now I think that Black has nothing better than G10 with an eye on C3 or D3 later.]
;W[en]C[ff - White walls off 5-6 lines of territory to the right.]

(;B[bp]C[ff - It is better to play C3 immediately.  White will not choose to play C4 in reply in this position.]

(;W[dm]C[domi [2d\]: yes I don't know well the difference

ff - A big question here is whether White can kill Black on the left if Black plays something like K3 now.  Exchanging C3 for D3 next makes it virtually impossible for Black to invade the bottom (as we see leter in the game).  This might be Black's last chance.  On the left side C3 and B8 (or B9?) look like miai for some kind of life.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cm]C[ff - This also looks unnecessary.  White's response strengthens the center further.]
;W[dl]C[danoontje [6d\]: you think the lower side is safe now?
domi [2d\]: was M8 a point I should have taken ?
danoontje [6d\]: well yes
danoontje [6d\]: but as i said i think h16 now is not good
domi [2d\]: he already has 80p sure
danoontje [6d\]: and you have?
domi [2d\]: well I don't know
danoontje [6d\]: also about 80?
danoontje [6d\]: lets say 60 on top, and 10 on both sides
domi [2d\]: can say if he invades at the right I will get the left and ...
danoontje [6d\]: i think nothing is lost yet
domi [2d\]: ok
danoontje [6d\]: but k12 is very important
domi [2d\]: K12 now ?
danoontje [6d\]: yes
domi [2d\]: so he plays E15 ?]
(;B[hd];W[ee]C[ff - Too optimistic perhaps.  Black need not answer this.]

(;B[fd]C[ff - This move is quite passive.  It only protects a small space between the D17 and H16 stones.  This can not be the largest point on the board.  Black has been forced here.  White leaves the E15 stone behind for now and turns away.]
;W[md]
(;B[kf]C[ff - This play looks loose.  I think that M15 is natural here - see the variation.]
;W[mf]
(;B[pg]C[Seigen [1d?\]: wouldnt it be very hard to kill?

ff - At this point it looks like Black really needs to kill White.  Just taking some territory while White escapes will not be enough to win.  Therefore the question is not "can" Black kill it, only "how".  :-)]
;W[kc]C[danoontje [6d\]: yes, maybe you should count before you do it]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[jb];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob]C[ff - This looks like a mistake.  I think White might have had an easier time by playing O16 here.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[mb];W[lb]
(;B[pb]C[ff - This looks like a mistake in reading.  It does not look like White can make two eyes on the side even if Black plays away here.  See variations.]
;W[ne];B[of]C[ff - Since Black played Q18, he should not be concerned about Whte breaking into the right side as long as there is no escape in the center.  M15 instead?]
;W[oe];B[pd];W[pe];B[rf];W[qf];B[qg];W[re];B[qe];W[pf];B[nf]
C[ff - This kind of play is not a good idea.  It forces White to connect a weakness (Black M15 would strengthen Black's stones).  At the same time it leaves behind new weaknesses in Black's position.]

C[domi [2d\]: oh the right is more large
danoontje [6d\]: eh domi try to ask questions so that i can understand them ;-)
danoontje [6d\]: yes right is more open]
(;W[iq]C[danoontje [6d\]: this is the wrong direction though]
;B[kq];W[ir];B[mn];W[mm]C[danoontje [6d\]: i think you played a bit too slow
danoontje [6d\]: defending all over.
danoontje [6d\]: but you know im too aggressive :-)
domi [2d\]: but after he played D8 do you think I have still a chance ?]

(;B[nq];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[op];W[pq];B[mr]C[domi [2d\]: yes cause with the san san I have some chances ?]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[np];B[jo];W[ip];B[kk];W[lk]C[ff - I will end the commentary here.  White looks to be safely ahead.  Although there are a lot of big plays left on the board, both sides will get their share.

Basically in this game Black started out a little slowly and was not able to stop White from enclosing a large framework.  White was able to push Black around a bit.  Black played a little too safely on the right side initially and later when White invaded the top.]

(;B[li]C[ff - If Black plays something like this, what will White do?  Suddenly Black is threatening to turn the whole upper right into a giant territory.  If White tries to get in behind this stone, Black can aim at setting up a double attack against both the new invader and the White stone on E15.  

When Black answers at F16 as in the game, the stone on E15 becomes light.  Even if it is captured in later fighting, the net investment is zero because of Black's reply.  In the present situation (M11 instead of E15) any future loss of E15 would represent a dead loss for White.]
