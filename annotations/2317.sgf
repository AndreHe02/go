C[Hi :-) I usually submit games where I lose, but in those games I usually make a really big mistake. I thought from a game where I won I might be able to get some pointers abt my style and smaller mistakes. Thank you very much for your help ~Erithid]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ed]C[I think this is considered slow, but i thought it would give me a little more strength on the left and top fights]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[dh];W[nq]C[in this instant i think it's ok because beginning game it's important to take points in corners]
;B[lq];W[qn];B[pn];W[qp];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qr];B[np]C[for same reasons it's ok in this corner]
;W[cj]C[making pressing good!];B[ci];W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[jd]
;W[ic]C[for me J17 is defensif too turned on making territory i should have played G15 to make pressing on the left for a future attack and more important to cut link between stones left-right then i should have put a stone on O17 to attack the right corner and also to attack the black stone K16.

but J17 make points ! perhaps and surely you had  right and you won the game !]
;B[jc];W[id];B[je];W[ie]C[J15 important!];B[pj];W[ql]C[R8 : for these reasons for me this stone is too defensif and forget to cut links between black stones . perhaps P6...]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[pm]C[I wouldnt normally crawl up the 3rd line like this, but i thought because of my stones in the left I would be able to reduce the effect of the black moyo]
;W[oe]C[Here I tried to get some presence to stop black from closing off this whole corner by playing tengenish]
;B[od];W[ne];B[nd];W[pe];B[me];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc];W[qf]
;B[pg];W[qg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[qi];B[ph]C[good for the idea to reduce black territory but ...]
;W[qj]C[R10 was a mistake for me because black
should have played S13 to take S12 and certainly the whole white group! because another black stone on Q14 may kill a white eye]
;B[pi];W[qk];B[rj];W[rg];B[rk]C[I wasnt sure w b played this stone, later one it worried me, because i thought maybe he saw something I did not]
;W[rl];B[pk];W[jj]C[Here I thought i significantly reduced the influence of the bloack moyo and assured myself something in center, or at least a good fight]
;B[ig]C[K10: good];W[jp]C[K4: perhaps a little high because black can attack in H3

...but the principe is good

But a white stone in K3 may give possibility to go out  O3 (it's  sente) for this reason  white should have add a second stone in F4 for example

i repeat more important it's you won and go it's difficult, another player will not tell same thing...

A REMARK:
it's important before playing a stone like K10 if there is not a threaten move(sente) for adding a second stone in this area like H12, G11,H11 etc... and reinforce K10]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir]C[good];B[js]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[lm];B[mn];W[mm]C[black is too nice to let u reinforce like this]
;B[nm];W[mj];B[ng];W[nl];B[ol];W[nk];B[li];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[hh];W[gh];B[gg];W[fh];B[fg];W[gj]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[ei];W[fj];B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[cd]C[Here I thought I should attempt to settle top and maybe reduce black in the area as well.]
;B[dd];W[db]C[I thought this was a neat move, in my head it protected both cuts]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[cq]C[stop pesky 3,3];B[ad]C[attention

C3 this move arrive in late black should have play earlier!]
;W[ac];B[ae];W[bc];B[ib];W[hb];B[ja];W[mi];B[mh];W[nh]C[N11: good]
;B[ni];W[mg];B[oh];W[nf];B[mf]C[small mistakes, but oh well, misread]
;W[gn]C[Here i thought my area was too big and i got scared, so i took teh chance to put something roughly in teh center]
;B[qs]C[G6 not necessary T17 for example or Q1,J14...];W[rs]
;B[ps];W[rr];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[sk];B[re]C[ok i wasnt sure how effective this attack would be, so i was really careful
I got nailed by damezumari in a couple games earlier in teh day, i was trying to stop it at all costs]
;W[qe]C[R15 no but T15];B[sd];W[si];B[se];W[sf];B[sc];W[rf]
;B[pb];W[if];B[jf];W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[eh];B[eg];W[is]
;B[ak];W[bl];B[al];W[am];B[aj];W[bm];B[ha];W[gb];B[ga];W[fa]
;B[ia];W[fb]C[F18 no necessary];B[kb];W[of];B[og];W[oj];B[nj]
;W[mk];B[ok];W[sj]C[T10 not necessary];B[nn]C[was this b stone neccessary? no]
;W[kl]C[i dont think i needed this either];B[lg]C[unnessessary too right? just making sure i didnt miss some great tesuji or something]

1) Any general remarks you have
2) was my fuseki ok?
3) Is my area in lower left secure and were the plays at g6 and l8 neccessary?

Thank you very much for your time and help. I always learn a lot from these reviews. ~Erithid]
