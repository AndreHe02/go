;B[pd]C[Thank you for reviewing my game, as well as your help in improving it!

Here I play as white on an IGS game. I've never been officially ranked, though i estimate my strength somewhere around 25-20 kyu.

My opponent was not rated when s/he challenged me.

In the end, black won by resignation. I knew where it was going by mid-game ^_^().

Olof: Hi, I hope you will enjoy my review and learn something.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[ce]C[Olof: This move is a little strange, responding to f3 looks natural. But it's still ok to play here.]
;B[cn];W[nc]TR[dn][fp]SQ[eo]C[I'd like to know how my opening went, and any suggestions on how it can pe improved. I've never actually studied any josekis so are there any suggestions in that sense, like how I should have responded, possible reading material?

Olof: Now you really need to play either e5 or f4 or d6, if you allow black to play e5 he has a very good opening.
If not counting the lower left corner this is a good move, an approach on q16 and an extension from your upper left shimari at the same time. Moves that do two or more things at the same time are always good.]
;B[nd]LB[md:B][qf:A]C[I believe this to be the beginning of a fight on the upper right side. I'm just wondering if there was a way for me to have profited more from it, then the end result of it.

Olof: This is the start of the so called attach and extend joseki. There are several variations but I'll show the most used one. See variation.]

(;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[qe];W[qk]LB[pf:A][rf:B]TR[qj]C[Olof: This feels misplaced. R10 is more natural as it threatens to connect r10 and r14. S14 also needs to be considered as it is now black can easily connect r12 and r15]

(;B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[qg]C[Olof: A little strange playing by black here. See earlier var]
;B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[mc];W[qn]TR[nf][np]SQ[og][oh]C[Olof. Black is very happy now, got a large corner and outside strength. 

This move is too slow, black is happy to play o4 for example. O14 looks like the only thing white can do to damage black here, it cuts off p13 and p12.]
;B[pn]C[Olof: Black if very fond of the attach and extend joseki I see, but after seeing how you played in the upper right corner I guess he tries to trick you again.]
;W[pm]C[Olof: Good, only move.];B[qo]LB[ql:A][on:B]C[Olof: This is a variation of the joseki, it is not used as much as it gives white a little to much outside strength and black ends up with bad shape.]

(;W[ql]TR[qk][on]C[Olof: This is bad in several ways. You already have a stone at r9 that is now unneccecery it is also to easy for black. You need to play p6. See var]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[on]C[Olof: Now white becomes over concentrated and has very bad shape while the black stones has perfect shape and work very nice together.]
;W[eo]C[Olof: Finally];B[cq]LB[cp:B][dq:A]
(;W[dq]C[Olof: Block on wrong side. See var];B[cp]LB[dm:C][em:B]
[co:A]
(;W[co]TR[dm][em]C[Olof: E7 or if you like to fight D7. See vars]
;B[bo];W[nq]TR[jq]C[Olof: There is a go proverb that says: "Don't play close to thickness. Black has a think position in the lower right corner and this is way to close to it. Black will pincer this without a doubt.

I would never get closer then k3 here.];B[lq];W[no];B[np];W[oe]
TR[nf]C[Olof: Why do you abandon your lower stones?

This can't do anything o14 if you want to play here.];B[od]
;W[md]C[Olof: uh?];B[me];W[ld];B[lc];W[jc]C[Before I realize it, i find myself hopelessly trapped by my opponents stones.

Olof: A lot of strange moves by white here starting with o3, you play one or 2 moves and then abandon the stones. Often you play a stone like that to see how your opponent responds before going to action in another part of the board. This is called Yose Miru (peep) but none of your moves here can be classified as such.

Here for example you NEED to play L16 to save your two stones other vice your last two move have been totally wasted (had been almost better to pass.]
;B[kd];W[le];B[lf]LB[em:B][gp:A]C[Olof: This is a ladder, there is no way you can get out of it but at least you can profit some from it. You do this by playing a ladder breaker. E7 for example, if black responds to the move locally you can suddenly save you stones in the ladder, if black captures the ladder then you get another move around e7 for free.]

(;W[gp];B[gq];W[ch]C[Olof: A little to close to your shimari, C11 or c10 looks better.]

[ep][dq]C[Any suggestions you have for my mid-game? ^_^()

Olof: Have a plan with each move, always think of at least one follow up to your move before playing it. If the move doesn't have a follow up then perhaps you should consider another move.
Second identify your week stones you need to make them strong BEFORE you can use them to attack. For example moves like g12 and j10 aims to attack the 3 black stones in then center but with you bottom group as weak as it is you can't attack, you need to save that group first.]

;W[bg];B[hj];W[er]TR[ik]C[Olof: The black stones you attacked earlier are still weak but by playing here you let black save them without even trying. J9 is the only move here.]

Olof: No problem. Some overall tips: You play tenuki a lot, there is a saying that goes "Always consider tenuki" but there is another saying that you should think about "Urgent moves before big moves". You often abandon you groups then they need the most attention and by the time you get back to them it's too late to save them.

If you have any more questions you can contact me either by mail: mcgreag@ludd.luth.se or on KGS, my screenname there is Mcgreag and you can find me in the romm "Svenska rummet".]
