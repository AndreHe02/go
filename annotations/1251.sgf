RE[W+3.5]

C[This was a pretty close game I won by 3.5 points.  I'm not convinced a did a good job reducing the low Chinese opening my oppponent played.  I felt I got lucky in some sense -- points I thought were significant weaknesses in my position weren't taken advantage of by my opponent.  Since this review will go to him too, please feel free to comment on play by both sides.

Thanks in advance.
Kirk

You played a couple of slow moves, and so black got a good start on expanding his moyo.  But black got timid about the life of his group on the left, and didn't defend a peep, so he gave you a chance to destroy his main territory.  You played a bad ladder, giving him too much of the moyo as territory, and the game was very close, and was finally decided by minor endgame mistakes.

The key to this game was how much terriory black could get from his lower side moyo, and you each had an opportunity to lock up the win there.

David];B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[iq];W[qn];B[np];W[pj]C[Some players hold back to q9, but both are good.]

(;B[cf]C[Professionals prefer to approach the upper right corner at this point.  Nornally, you should make a shimari first, then extend. In this game, white has extended on the right edge from the upper right corner before making a shimari, so approaching the upper right is important.

But this move is fine.];W[fd];B[dj]
(;W[ep]C[What other viable options are there at this point?

The black framework is loose, so you can ignore it for now and make your shimari in the upper right.  If black make a shimari also, you can plan in the center to reduce.

If you want to come in now, you hit the right spot.]
(;B[dq]C[Most players play at d6 now rather than d3.]
(;W[dn]C[I figured this separates the left from the corner -- allowing black to play here would make things very tough.  I figured e3 makes me too heavy -- I need to stay light here in black's sphere of influence, right?

I like this move.  This is where black should have played, so it's probably good.  But black can cut and start a fight, or take territory on the left edge.

I would have played at c5.

I think e3 is still playable.]
(;B[cl]C[I'd prefer to play directly in the corner.  I show a few alternative moves, but I don't know what is best.]
;W[dp]C[Expecting c3, which black did.  If black c5, I cut at c3 and cause trouble (hopefully, see variation).

c3 looks a little strange to me.  I would play c5 or e3.]
(;B[cq];W[co]
(;B[fr]C[I might have jumped on the 3rd line instead, but this move is also good.]

(;W[bn]C[This seems misguided.  I guess I was looking for eyeshape, but it is gote.  Is it better to press black at g3?  Or maybe just tenuki altogether -- p17?

How about c7?  It gains as much eye shape, and is sente.  But it also strengthes black.

I don't like g3, since you will get cut.

p17 eems reasonable.  I don't see a severe attack on your lower left group.]
;B[od]
(;W[pf]C[Odd-looking white formation on the right now.  Probably a pincer would have been more consistent with the rest of the board.

Yes.  this moves gives the right side a strange shape.  You should try something else.

I like the 3 space high pincer best, since it puts the q10 stone in a reasonable place.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[rb]
(;B[kc]C[Black should consider extending one space less.  This move gives white a sente extension at j17, which makes good shape for him. Holding back one makes white's extension less urgent, and less good, so it is more likely that black will get another move on the upper side.]
;W[ic];B[om]C[Excellent.  Expand the lower side moyo.]
(;W[io]C[Hmm.  I guess I ignored p7 because the corner is still open, but playing q8 is good as it solidifies me and the corner remains open...  Of course, I'm not sure what I'm trying to do with j5. It's not really connected to the white group in the lower left, which will be a problem later...

I don't like this move.

You have threatened an invasion on the upper side, and black ignored you, so invading is big.

Defending the right side is big.

Your move doesn't do much.  Black is already reduced by your group in the lower left.  Your move might get cut from the lower left, causing you problems.  And there is no white framework behind it, so it doesn't help make a moyo.

You do prevent black from expanding on the lower side, but after you invade the corner, it is not so big.  In the game this stone gets cut off.]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]C[Is it better here to play q2 instead?]
;B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[or];B[nr];W[pr];B[ke]C[Black takes sente, but white gains in the lower right and black is overconcentrated there, so I didn't have any complaints.]
;W[qk]C[Concerned about a black play at r12, but this three-space jump (q14 to q10) will be a concern for a long time to come...]
;B[pl];W[bd]C[Black's territory is open at the lower edge, so I'm okay with giving him the left side.

Good.  This is very big.];B[go];W[ch]C[I don't like this invasion.  Black just split your stones on the lower side, and you have to do something to prevent a huge moyo from developing.  This black areas is undercut on both sides, so it will never be very big.]
;B[dh]
(;W[di]C[The other variation is worth more territory, but leaves black thicker.]
;B[ci];W[ei];B[cj];W[dg]C[Perhaps this would be better at b12.  It seems like it should be possible to completely separate black here...]
;B[bh]
(;W[cg]C[
This move is not good.  It gives up sente for no gain.  You should capture the one stone instead.  Giving black  a second move on the lower side is too good for him.]
;B[bg];W[eh]C[Black is (somewhat) pressed down, but it is again gote for me.

Only because of c13.]
(;B[gm]C[Excellent move.  Close white in and expand the moyo at the same time.

White made two slow moves at b6 and c13, so black should be able to start something.

It seems later that black is worried about the life of the black group on the side.  If so, you should play a move a little closer that helps that group more.]
;W[el]C[The next moves seem inconsistent , on both sides.

Here, white is clearly trying to escape.]
(;B[dm]C[Since there is no cut, this is not a good move.  It strengthes white and weakens black.  Only make this kind of move if you can follow it with the cut at e6.

Also, playing across the knight's move (at e7), usually works better.  In this position it looks like you can use e7 to get a unreasonable ko to seal white in, so e7 is not so good either, unless you like complicated fights.

I like f9 best, to be consistent with closing white in and further expanding the moyo.]
;W[em];B[ej]C[Black continues to cut.];W[fj]C[But now white gives up on getting out.  I was expecting f9 or g8, to escape with the white stones.

Of course, escaping will help black make a big territory on the lower side, so it would better if white just lived rather than running.

So it looks like white's goal now is to enclose the black stones on the left, and make them live in gote, while getting strong on the outside.]
;B[fk]
(;W[fn]C[But now white doesn't cut, letting black get out.

Black should be trying to make a big territory on the lower side. This would give him a win.  If black answers this peep, his territory gets very strong.   
As white, I would keep this peep, since I might need it on the other side (at h6) to do something inside black's moyo.  The white group can live easily with c7, so if you want to make eye space, I would start there instead.]

(;B[ek]C[Black must answer the peep.  There is a huge terriory to be made. If white cuts, the black group won't die.

After this move, black must lose most of the lower side.  SInce that is black's only big territory, he should now lose.

If black does need to connect out, the atari at g10 is better than this move.]
;W[gn]C[Now black's moyo will be greatly reduced.];B[hn];W[ho]
;B[gp];W[hm];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[gl]C[The black group is in no danger.  I would expand the territory instead.]

(;B[gk]C[Again the atari is the better way to connect out.]
;W[jm];B[gj]C[Very slow.  Defend your big territory.

Moves 67, 77, and 79 served no purpose but to connect your group out to the center.  But that group was not in danger.  In exchange you gave white 3 moves to destroy your big territory.]

(;W[kn]C[I played this sequence as a ladder since it was a sure continuation. In retrospect, I probably could have simply played n3 directly.

Usually playing a ladder that doesn't work loses points, so there should be a better way.  Playing n3 first is much bigger (about 20 points).  Black's territory will be completely destroyed. This way he keeps most of it.]

(;B[ib]C[Too small.  You can invade instead.];W[gc]
(;B[lg]C[Small again.  This move doesn't increase any black territory, and hardly reduces white.  You can make a much bigger reduction.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[mc];W[jf];B[le];W[jd];B[kd]C[What are you afraid of?  There is no white cut here.  Play something big rather than just answering the white moves.]

(;B[ga]C[Monkey jump is sente here, so do it.  Hold back one line like this only when the monkey jump is gote.

There are a lot of small endgame mistakes.  At this point the game is very close, so you should pay careful atention to the size of the moves.]
