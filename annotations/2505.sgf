C[I am Black in this game. I would like to know what my most important errors are, so I can improve on them.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pq];B[od];W[po];B[ep];W[dj];B[qj]SQ[jc]
[jq]C[rehn: playing around the squares are now the biggest moves]
;W[ql]C[rehn: so I would say that this is a misstake by white]
;B[jq]C[White would like to play here, so it should also be big for me.

rehn: correct. The next big move is around k17];W[lq]C[rehn: white is playing to small. But lock out for the invasions he is preparing (around h3 or r13)]
;B[jc]C[rehn: so far I think black has played well];W[hc]C[rehn: white just answers black instead of taking the corresponding next big point. He should have ansered black k3 with k17.]
;B[cl]SQ[je][oj][jo]C[Is this too close to my corner enclosure?

rehn: Since white d10, you cannot go much further in that direction. I would have protected against invasions by playing at one of the squared points, but I don't think this is very bad either.]
;W[cj];B[oj]C[rehn: good!];W[cd]C[rehn: white is playing too slow. Black has no reason to play faster at this point.]
;B[ie]C[Move on the line of separation of two frameworks.

rehn: and more important, protect against invasion by white close to m17]
;W[ge];B[ig];W[lh]C[rehn: white has to do something, but this is very dangerous. Black can take advantage of this. Even if black cannot kill white, black can build influence and maybe even territory by hunting white.]
;B[jj];W[lf];B[ng]C[Should I have played m10 and try to kill the two white stones?

rehn: I would have done that, but I am not sure if it had been wise. The chances would have been quite good I think. M12 was too deep and without prober preparations. An invasion at h3 is much more natural for white. If white is killed now, black wins huge]
;W[jf];B[if];W[jd];B[id];W[ic];B[kc];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld];B[mc]
;W[jh];B[ih];W[kj]C[rehn: I would probably have continued hunting him. See variation]

(;B[fg]C[rehn: Protection from invasion at k5 would have been bigger, but look out for the cut at j11 or j12.]
;W[mj];B[dg]C[rehn: It seems as you two don't play on the same board. Build strength by attacking your opponents weaknesses.]
;W[cg]C[rehn: as you said before: "Move on the line of two frameworks" (or something like that). The big point here is around k5. It is also important to take control of the center.]
;B[dh]C[rehn: this is to small at this point. Just look out so you don't get isolatet. Remember: connect and cut!]
;W[ch];B[fj];W[dl];B[dm];W[el];B[cm];W[hq]C[rehn: Here comes the invasion. This is the turning point of the game.]
;B[jo];W[ho];B[gm];W[jr];B[kr]C[Perhaps this move is wrong? In the end I lose a few stones?

rehn: white is playing a common tesuji. Black cannot stop white from connecting. see variation. The only thing black can do here is to run out in the center. Now it would have been very advanteous to have had control of the center that you could have got by pressing on his stone on L19.]
;W[kq]
(;B[iq];W[ir];B[gr]C[rehn: this is bad. Black forces white to make a move that white would like to do anyway and strengthens white but get no equal strength in return.]
;W[hr];B[gp]C[rehn: the same with this move];W[hp];B[gq]C[rehn: at this point, white is no longer behind]
;W[in];B[ji];W[nk];B[ok];W[nl];B[jm]C[rehn: too late];W[jn]
;B[im];W[kn];B[km];W[lm]C[rehn: and at this point black is maybe 15 points behind]
;B[ol];W[om];B[ki]C[rehn: what are black trying to achieve. Better to take big endgame points along the edge.]
;W[li];B[kk];W[lj];B[ll];W[mm];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[fd];B[gf]
;W[de];B[df];W[cf];B[gd];W[gc];B[hd];W[di];B[ei];W[bk];B[bl]
;W[pl];B[ck];W[ej];B[fh];W[ne];B[oe];W[nf];B[of];W[mg];B[nh]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[rk]C[rehn: now white is a little bit behind again (not sure how that happened). From now on, black lets white controll most of the endgame. Instead of just defending, black should try to find corresponding weak points.]

;W[aj];B[al];W[ik];B[hj];W[jk];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[White wins by 0.5.

Try to make moves that have at least two purposes. Never just defend and never just attack. See how you can win something in an other part of the board while attacking. Build your strength and defence while attacking. In this game you could both have got center influence and defended your lower left while attacking the white stones that invaded your framework in the upper right.

Think: where is my opponent weak? how can I gain something while attacking him even if I don't manage to kill him?

If the urge is great to defend, think: how can I defend while attacking something? 

Try to take controll of the game!])
(;B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[kp];W[ko]C[rehn: something like this]
))
(;B[jk];W[kk];B[jl];W[ml];B[ol];W[mn];B[ko]C[rehn: I have not put a lot of thought into this variation. Just want to illustrate the general idea of build a large framework in the lower left by hunting white. Black also get important center influence.]
