C[I play Black (Stepenwolf). I have no ranking, and these are my first 19 games.

I would like some analysis about the
opening and my major errors in the
middle game. The fight on the lower
side (moves 74-108) that I lost cost me 40 points.
What should I have done ???

In the endgame, I modestly think I have given sente in a clumsy way, costing me about 15 points or so. Now I have understood that I need to prioritize my endmoves according to that.

Michel.

jorg: Hi Michel. I try my best to review the game. Please take my comments only as suggestions - verify them for yourself and adopt what suits your own style.

My English is not really good, so please write me an email if something should not be clear. :-)

By the way: a loss with over 100 points is quiet common at the beginning of a go career. Don't be discouraged. Enjoy the game and be amazed how fast you are improving.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[jc]MA[op][oq][dp]C[----
jorg: This point is not too bad, because White might want to play there too. But the timing is not good and it is a little bit too timid.   After playing in the corners making an corner enclosure or playing an approach move is regarded as a good play - unless you have a special stretegy in mind.   In this case I would prefer a play at one of the marked points (P3 or P4) because a White approach there would be good in relation with D4. It also secures some points and may become the base of a big moyo.]
;W[nc]C[----
jorg: White is looking for trouble. ;-)]
(;B[qf]MA[jc]C[----
jorg: K17 limits the space of White. I think it is best to punish White more severely. A contact play is the way to do this in this case. (see var)]
;W[pb]MA[qf]C[----
jorg: With your play at R14, White can now make a base.];B[qc]
;W[ne]MA[lc]C[Michel: Please, what should be the shape there, this black moyo looks horrible...

----
jorg: in fact it is no moyo at all. :-) But White has still a very bad shape. Playing at the marked point instead would be the correct play for White - it makes a base.

In my opinion your position is much better than White's.  -Your group in the upper right is save and makes some points.  - There is not much to say about the other corners - everything is open there.
- The white group in the upper right still has no base and is pincered by a black stone.   When you develop your game, don't try to "see" territory. First of all, evaluate the safety of the groups on the board and accordingly defend or attack. Weak groups are always a burden.]
;B[fc]C[----
jorg: I like this move very much. It is flexible. You might develop a base for the two stones or take the corner and still isolate and attack the white group to the right, etc. It now depends on White's answer...]
;W[ec]MA[jc]C[----
jorg: This is maybe the worst answer. Do you remember what I said about this kind of contact play? The idea is to make the other player's stones over-concentrated, but in this case the marked stone (K17) is ideally placed. AND you will have sente after the next two moves. :-)]
;B[fd]C[----
jorg: very good.];W[df];B[dn]C[----
jorg: I would play one line to the left. It is easier to make a base. On the other hand - a white pincer is not so easy now. Maybe a matter of taste. But I'd rather play this high when trying to reduce a moyo.]
;W[bo]C[----
jorg: White is really concerned about his corner. This is not really consistent with the play at the starpoint (D4), which emphasizes fast development.]

(;B[cn]C[----
jorg: I regard this move as the first real mistake. It is so slow and haevy. What is the purpose of it? It is not a threat to the white corner. It does not secure territory. It does not develop your position.

It is not a standard position, but developing a light presence on the side seems to be the best idea to me. (see var)

Imagine a white play around C10 now (see next white move).]

(;W[fq]C[----
jorg: White is still concerned about the corner. With the 4-4 point you need 2 more moves to secure a corner. That's why you usualy play e.g. the 3-4 point if you want to play a territory-oriented strategy. White's strategy is not consistent.

And he made a big mistake as well. He should have evaluated the security of the groups on the board. With your heavy black group here an attack would have been best. (see var)

Remember that it is best to develop the own positions whilst chasing the opponent. Very important rule!]

(;B[fo]C[----
jorg: Now you missed the second chance to secure your stones.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[di];B[ei];W[dh]C[Michel: After White d12, I didn't know what my best option was.   I don't know what to do:
see my questions in variations...

Instead I fell into passivity by
playing m17 instead of right side r9 ?
or perhaps p4 to enclose corner, or
r11, q11 ?

----
jorg: White made a lot of points here, while your position is still thin.]

(;B[lc]MA[cn][dk]C[Michel: So.
Black:
upper : 10 points ?
right : 5 points ?
lower right corner : ???

White:
right up: 30 pts
right low: 20 pts

Black has missed completely the opening...


----
jorg: That is not really true. You made some good moves and White some mistakes. But you made a very big mistake with the play of C6. Then you forced White to take territory on the left side. Try to avoid this.

This play is indeed very small, but not too bad, because it attacks the white group by taking away the base of it.   R11, Q11: I would not play there. Too passive in my eyes.

P4: good idea. Enclosing a corner is big and maybe should have been your third move in the game. It also forces White to do something about the right side. You would definitely have the advatage here and make a lot of points. A fight could easily affect the white group in the upper right as well.   R9: I don't know. A little bit low and not with a real purpose? Making a moyo would not be possible.

Your variations: I would not play here at all. The two black groups here seem to be save for now and there is not a really big play for White here. As you found out in your variations White would only become stronger. You should treat the black group in the lower left as light and be prepared to give something away. But it is too big to be captured as a whole and still can run away or make two eyes.

I would prefer P4 and try to catch up in points and shift the battle to the right where you have the advantage.]
;W[dl];B[el]CR[cn][dn][fo]C[Michel: Please some comment about the contact fighting here.  Later on in the game, it will turn out that I will not have been able to keep the marked stones alive.

----
jorg: This is all about reading. I suggest to solve some problems (tsume-go). There are a lot of books and also some sites on the internet.   But let's see...

This move is ok, I think.];W[ek]
(;B[ej]C[----
jorg: Ah, this may be a mistake. Important: Don't try to save every stone. Especially ones with no purpose. By giving away these two, you could have saved all the rest. There would not have been a big follow-up for White as well.

This is an important concept. Playing lightly means to be prepared to abandon some stones on order to save others or gain some speed, strength, etc...

All the variations look much better. try it for yourself. I am sure, that there are other moves as well. The key is: Do not try to save every stone!]
;W[em]
(;B[fl]MA[cn][dn][fo]C[----
jorg: you try to save a single stone as well. This was maybe your last chance to save the marked group.

Now you are in big trouble and will loose a lot of points. Even if you manage it to get away with the marked group White will get territory and strength to both sides of it. Simply by chasing it. If you try to run away, the burden will only become more heavy for you.]

(;B[ho];W[eo]TR[cn][dn][en]C[Michel: now triangles are definitively cut, h5 was a mistake, as I will try without success to keep circles alive, fail, and loose about 40 points in the disaster...

----
jorg: true. Maybe the game is over. And remember: this bad situation developed from the heavy move of C6 and your effort to save every single stone of the group. Now you lost all. That should make clear, that it is best to think about the concept of sacrifice techniques. ;-)]

 Stepenwolf 30k : Increase naked's time by 5 minutes];W[sg]
;B[sf];W[sh];B[pg]C[----
jorg: summary

- In the opening try to play big moves as soon as possible - like makeing a  corner enclosure or an approach move

- The fight in the lower left started to get ugly because of two main reasons: a heavy play and your try to save unimportant stones. Become more relaxed and play lightly. Try to sacrifice stones to gain an advantage.

- A couple of times White invaded in your positions. You tried to attack the invader with kind of contact moves. A contact move is a good idea to make White overconcentrated in some positions, but usualy the invader becomes only stronger. Attack more from a distance of one space or more and try to prevent the invader from making a base. Secure territory while you chase him out to the center.

BTW, did you know that White can make a seki in the lower right? You would loose another 7 points... ;-)

jorg: The general idea is good: making a base. The ideal extension is three though. (see var). If you have a wall of 2 stones make a 3-space extension, if you have a wall of 3 stones make a 4-space extension. From 1 stone make a 2-space extension. These extension can not be cut by the opponent.

Don't worry about a follow up. It depends on White then. (see var)]
