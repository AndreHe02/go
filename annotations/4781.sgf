C[Hello,

thank you for commenting this game, please feel free to show anything you think might be better move than played. I added some comments myself, so if you find them incorrent, pls tell:).

Btw, I'm white in this game:).

Dakre: Hello, even though you were ahead early in the game it was interesting to analyze... in the middlegame you were giving some points to black, which is ok, because you were ahead and probably wanted to play a bit more careful to keep the points until the end, but on the other hand you made some agressive moves and engaged in fights which you shouldn't or better: did not need to... ;)]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[oc];W[qn]LB[qj:A][pp:B]C[Experimental move, trying to reduce black's expansion possibilites from shimari

Dakre: interesting idea ;) may be a good move. i think only pro's can distinguish moves in the fuseki so close together, but imagine Black playing at A... it would be a nice extension in addition to the shimari in the upper right and maybe you need a move in the corner now to assist your stone? if black would take the corner after A with B for example your stone does not have a good continuation, because you can not make a decent two-point extension as usual for example...]
;B[dp];W[fq]LB[dc:A][de:B][cn:C]C[Dakre: this is the wrong direction. the "open door" of your stone A is at B... the left side is the one important for you... therefore you s hould play from the other side at C]
;B[cn];W[kq]LB[jp:B][fq:A]C[Dakre: i think this is an imbalanced move. It is too far away to help the other white stone at A much and it doesn't do well in combination with the stone at R6... imagine you closing the corner... then this stone would better be on B. imagine black going into the corner, you can princer and have a nice down-up-down structure... 
So i would prefer this move at B];B[de]C[Dakre: nice for black ;)]
;W[ce]LB[pq:A]C[Chose this to get sente to close bottom right corner


Dakre: very nice thought! bottom right is the only corner left and you are going to play there first. a white stone at A would be a nice shimari in combination with your stones on the lower side.
This is a nice move];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[pq]C[Dakre: nice... most important side now is the right side... black want's a extension to it's shimari and you want a double wing framework]
;B[qj];W[pi]LB[oj:B][kq:A]C[Too early? Top side looks big.

Dakre: yes top side is big, but you're strengthening black here... even though it looks interesting, because white builds a lot of influence facing the middle and with the stones at the bottom makes a nice moyo... but now the white stone at A would better be on the fourth line!! another idea would be not to touch the black stone and play at B to limit the black moyo as well. but the direction you chose seems good]
;B[qi]
(;W[pg]C[Dakre: this, however, is the wrong direction... you should want to maintain a connection to the lower right... look at the variation]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[ok];W[qg]C[Seems bit dangerous.

Dakre: yes, you're driving black into your moyo-prospects... :>]
;B[oe];W[mh]C[Dakre: i'd prefer a one space jump more, here... if black defends thick, you have to spend another move here to make sure you stay connected... ;)]
;B[jc]TR[qh][qi][qj][ok]C[Dakre: overplay by black... black should worry about his marked group... now you have a good opportunity to use this weakness to build your lower side]
;W[ql]C[Dakre: good move];B[qk];W[pl];B[oj];W[li];B[nh]C[From 33 to 38, I think this exchange gave nothing to black, only made me stronger.

Dakre: yes, very true!! maybe misread by black...];W[ng];B[ni]
;W[mf];B[mi];W[lj];B[mk];W[mm]C[Dakre: good sense of direction here... ;) your upper group is weak but should be able to handle it... with this you keep black weak and build territory...]
;B[lk];W[km];B[sf];B[lh]C[Dakre: i don't understand... two black moves here? T14 seems odd, too... so i guess T14 should not be here?]
;W[mg];B[kh];W[kf]C[I was prepared to sacrifice 32, 38 stones after the cut

Dakre: yes, first pull this group out...];B[of];W[og];B[ld]
;W[md]

TR[li][lj]C[I'm very happy

Dakre: you should be ;) very nice result for white... White is definitely ahead now!! your group is secure and you still could start moving the marked white group.]
;W[ji]C[Dakre: and you do apparently... ;)];B[jk];W[jh];B[mj]
;W[jj]C[Sacrifice was not needed after all :)];B[hq];W[dq];B[ep]
C[Seems weak

Dakre: yes, black should take the corner to keep the seperated white group weak]
;W[eq];B[go]C[Dakre: blacks influence is not worth much here, because white is strong at the top]

;W[mq];B[nn];W[oo];B[nm];W[mn];B[lo];W[nl];B[ml];W[kn];B[ol]
;W[jo]C[Dakre: bad trade for black ;) white is even more ahead at this point]
;B[fo];W[gp]C[Terrible cut..];B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[jp]C[Dakre: ... but your decision here was right ;) even though the ponuki hurts a little]
;B[hn];W[ge];B[gg];W[gi]C[Dakre: same as before... even though you reach further with a two space jump... carefully consider the defense of it... if black plays near it you need an additional move to maintain the connection!]
;B[hg]C[This was painful

Dakre: yes ;)]
(;W[gk]LB[ie:A]C[Dakre: i would have taken the top with A for example... look at the variation...]

;B[he];W[pk];B[pj];W[ie];B[jd];W[jf];B[he];W[bf];B[bg];W[ie]
;B[on]TR[oj][ok][ol]C[Dakre: this is a bad threat... because if white reacts here, white gains a lot... three stones and an additional threat to kill the marked group]
;W[ig]C[Dakre: you chose to ignore this threat... the top is bigger than loosing the three marked stones, but it is at least something black gets. It is a good trade for black and white may have gotten more out of this... but considering that white is still well ahead it was the right decision to end the ko here ;)]

;B[qo];W[so];B[sn];W[sp];B[rm]C[The result seem even...

Dakre: yes, the ko at the top was bigger, i think, but black can be sattisfied]
;W[cl]LB[be:B][bh:C][ei:A]TR[gi]SQ[gg][hg]C[Overplay I think

Dakre: definitely... because you don't need this move to win the game!! just reduce black and play carefully... don't engage in fighting when you're on the winning side... ;)

big for example would have been something like A or B... A threats cutting of the two marked stones... B is threatening to play C next and pull that one out to the triangeled white support. You can however play C directly and reduce blacks territory, but then black can reduce your's aswell after capturing B14.
The move you chose is not bad... it is creating aji and black must be careful in answering. but to win you don't need such an agressive move. anything can happen. black may capture it and become stronger, then you can not reduce anymore... so if you're ahead, just reduce... if you're behind, this is a very good move ;)]
;B[el]LB[ek:A]C[Dakre: black leaves flaws behind... the lower side is not the weak one... it is the upper side... so i'd like A for black more than the move played. It strengthens blacks upper side more and white should not be able to escape with C8 anyway.]

(;W[ff]LB[dg:A]C[Misread, connection at d13 lives..

Dakre: true ;) playing A yourself would have been better of course ;)]
;B[dg]LB[mh:3][gi:3][cl:1][kq:2]TR[gg][hg]C[I managed to get big endgame and win by few point, can't remember how many anymore:). I like this game,although there are many mistakes.

Dakre: at this point black managed to secure the two marked stones AND your upper left corner is open for black to jump in... you lost some points in this sequence, but you're still a little ahead.

There are a few things i want to point out so you can remember in your next games beginning with the most important:
1. counting
you should always know who is ahead and roughly by howmuch. And when you count you should do this objectively... not count more points for your opponent than for yourself. if you miscounted and you discover at the end of the game it is just a matter of training... but your strategic decisions based on a good count can give the game another pace. if you're ahead you don't need to fight. Just give away some points to be on the safe side and don't risk too much. A good example for you doing this is the ko fight. You made the right decision there ending the ko even though you may have gotten more out of it. An example for a wrong decision is the stone marked with 1 ;) reducing is the way to go if you're ahead... if you're behind 1 would be a good move, because almost anything can happen... if the opponent blunders or you play a very good move you can still turn the tide... but if you're ahead the risk is too big.

2. fourth vs. third line
Your opening was already quite good and you like to experiment, which gives even a better understanding of the opening. But if you place a move and ask yourself: "Fourth or Third line?" then try to answer the question: "Is this a moyo based game or a territory based?". Fourth line is for influence and third line for security (and cash in hands territory).

3. two space jumps
Two space jumps are fast and good to get ahead of your opponent. But remember that they may need additional defense when the opponent plays near them... and beware any double threats this way ;)


I hope this review was helpful for you.])
