C[Both of us are beginners, we played at most 100 games on the 13x13 board. Almost every game we play looks similiar - we divide the board, and then somebody tries to invade and reduce the area of the opponents half.

In this game I was playing black.
We appreciate any advices and hints.];B[jj];W[dd];B[id]LB[kd:A]
C[Does not secure any territory , i would prefer A(L10)];W[dj]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[fd];W[fb]LB[dg:A][jg:D][ch:C][kh:E][fk:B]C[You have a few options that would work well B or C to attack the left corner, A - black intends to split white in 2 and D or E  which secures your territory , at the moment D or E would be my choice]
;B[gb]C[Maybe I should play somewhere else, D7, or G4?];W[ed]
;B[fe];W[ee]LB[dg:A][kh:C][fk:B]C[Not big enough A or B would do more , or attack at C which stops black from creating a big wall on the side.]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[fg];W[eh];B[fh];W[fi]C[After that move I've lost pretty much points at the bottom side]
;B[gi]LB[kh:A]C[Now would be a good time to play and create life before blacks wall at the bottom is too solid.]

(;B[jk]C[Not needed , see variations , the push at E13 is in sente so even if you really feel like defending , first play the sente move and then return to the block.]

(;W[ea];B[ga];W[jg]C[Invasion begins

When invading , start on the 3rd line as it will be easier to create eyes using the side.]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[jf]LB[lf:A][li:B]C[A and B aim at running out along the side , thus making space for the eyes.]

[mk][kl][ll][ml][km][lm][mm]C[A hint on invasions , when invading try to jump both ways of your stone as to create as much space along the side to create eyes, when being invade try to half the space in which invasion is happening.

Hope it has helped, play as many games as possible in the beginning thats what helps you improve the most :-)]
