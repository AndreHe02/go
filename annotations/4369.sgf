C[This was a game I can learn a lot from. It would be good to learn
something about what was really going on and who stood better.
Where can I do better in the fighting and in looking after my
groups? Looked like I had lots of chances before I finally fell
apart. Also there may have been chances to sacrifice.



Hi, I'm Darrell.  Hope you enjoy the review.  Rough game.

Main lesson:  Keep your groups strong.  And a bit of life-death study would be good.  But mainly, keep your groups strong.]

(;B[be]C[This move got you in trouble.

The problem with this move is that you have to play twice here.  Just keep your stones strong and surround white and you will end in sente and white will get almost nothing.  And if white's not careful, he will die.

This is a very important concept when you are attacking.];W[bd]
