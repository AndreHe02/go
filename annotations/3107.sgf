C[I played this game at the CyberOro server. I got totally sluaghtered, due to my inability in fighting.

I believe I had a few good chances at attacking profitably, but I made blunders. Please comment specifically on those blunders. Thank you.

djna: my comments inidicated by my initials.

W says he  doesn't fight well. I'm not sure that's true. W made one very large mistake - move 102 - I don't think that the rest of W's play indicates that that mistake is typical. B played very solid go, and did well in the opening.

More summary at the end.];B[po];W[dd];B[cf]C[djna: interesting move by B. Normally we should play an empty corner. 

When someone plays a move like this. ask whether it needs a response. What's the most severe thing B can do to follow up?
See variation.]
(;W[fd]C[djna: the variation explains why I think that W should not reply in this corner]
;B[bd]C[djna: also B should be keen to play the other corner, so playing here is probably a bit slow too]
;W[dq]C[djna: OK so W plays away, good.

Choice of 3-4 though encourages B to apprach.];B[co];W[ep]C[djna: this seems to yield the side to B , so I'd prefer to pincer, but the B side is not solid so maybe this is OK]
;B[cl];W[iq]TR[ep][dq]C[Here, I was thinking  of a longer extension at K3. However, I was worriex about a direct invasion at G3 or H3.

So, which is the better move? This or the longer extension?

djna: If you think of  the two marked stones as a wall of height 2 ( Pretend D3 is at E3) then an extension of 3 lines is right, so J3 is OK.]
;B[pc]
(;W[pq]C[I thought this move was maybe too hasty, especially after my opponent responded. I was thinking of an approach at Q14 or Q15 first.

Which would be better?

djna:  see the variations - I do agree that this doesn't seem the best move]
;B[oq];W[pp]TR[pq]C[I was considering P2 instead, which one would be better?

djna: I can't see a good way for W after this move.

P2 is the joseki move, B will have the choice of a large corner or walling W in.

Perhaps the marked approach is not good.];B[op];W[qo];B[qn]
SQ[po]C[This position didn't look good for me. At any rate, I would be shut in.

The series of moves I made affter this one just worsened the situation.

djna: the original marked stone entitles B to outside influence, you would expect to be shut in when you invade.

So accept what B is entitled to, rather thean look for the unreasonable]
;W[oo]LB[qh:C][pn:A][qp:B]C[djna: You can play this move for three reasons:

1). You have read very carefully and*know* it works.

2). It feels like a reasonable fight - sometimes you do have to play by feeling.

3). You are so desperate thet you are prepared to try anything. This is called hacking. It's fun, but it's not a good way to get stronger.

I find this so hard to analyse even with stones and a board that I could not figure it out. I don't reckon that you have reason 1.

You know B will connect at A. Imagine the sitaution after that. You have 4 stones mostly disconnected  and weak. B has two quite strong groups. Intuition says that that W would not have a good time.

So either you need to improve your intuation or try to avoid playing "hacking" moves"!

Better, just connect at B and live. then play  C to break up the side.]
;B[pn];W[no];B[pr];W[qr];B[or]TR[oo]C[djna: Now it's very difficult for W. I think that the marked cut is an overplay.]
;W[rq]C[djna: I think that this fails,]
(;B[lq];W[mq]C[djna: Not sure it works, see variation]
(;B[mr]C[djna: B conceeds];W[mp];B[kr];W[ro];B[ko]TR[pn][qn]
[po]C[And this is the result...

djna: you are right to dislike this result.

W has damaged his left side, now an invasion may work and B can pressure the left group. The 4 w  stones are isolated, but there is a little hope: B has a flimsly group marked]

(;W[pf]C[
djna : I think this makes life easy for B];B[qh]TR[no][oo][mp]
[mq]C[djna: compare with the variation.

Here B is strengtheneing his weak group and surrouding the marked stones on a big scale]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[mc]C[I thought this move by my opponent was a bit insecure, but I don't know how to attack it properly....

djna: you can't really attack it until your own group is strong. Some weaknesses must be left for attacking later.]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[cp];B[bo]TR[no][oo][mp][mq]C[
djna: the problem for W now is finding a plan.

How valuable are the 4 white stones? 

Well they cut two B groups apart. If either can be attacked then we want to keep the 4 stones alive.  

The bottom B group is alive,  so it's the right side we need to think about. If you can really attack those stones then setting the the W group into motion is good. Otherwise W would be better sacrificing them.]
;W[om]C[
djna: so if this works it's good.];B[ql]LB[qj:A]C[djna: big question now for W, what's next? If B plays A then he's pretty much alive and W is left with a large group to look after,]
;W[qj]C[djna: so, I can understand why W plays here, but B has lots of possible answer. See variation for one possibility. 

My overall conclusion is that W has too many groups to manage to do well in this fight.]

(;B[oh]C[
djna: now we see the problem. The upper  W group is also weak.]
;W[oj]LB[oh:4][qj:3][ql:2][om:1]C[I think this is what cost me the fight here...

Would a move at Q9 have been better than this one?


djna: yes, I think that this gives B too much to work with. Q9 is better.
it's very hard to be sure it works, but is it doesn't then the original plan starting at the marked stone was flawed.]
;B[ol];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[on]
(;W[nn]C[I also think blocking here immediately was a mistake, Would extending one space then blocking have been better? (that is, O7 first, then block)

djna: see variation, I think B can handle that too. The overall result is kind of "fair" B gets a little life, W gets the outside. Each side got what they were entitled to, but overall it favours B.


Q9 instead of P10 would have been better.];B[pk];W[nm];B[qk]
;W[ok];B[pj]LB[oo:B][pp:A]TR[cc][jc][rf][eg]C[
djna: overall result is bad. If I were B I would be looking forward to attacking the whole W group later. Also, it looks to me that the top right W group is in severe trouble.

Fundamentally, W is in a losing position now.

The reasons: moves A and B in the corner.

The probem now is that W urgently needs to play in at least 3 places: To save his to right group, strengthen his top left group, and to stop B growing a moyo on the left.

I would play K17, hoping that B will answer in the top right and then E13.]
;W[cc]C[djna: certainly big, but not so easy to follow up.]
;B[hc]LB[cc:A]TR[bd][cf]C[I also thought this move by my opponent is a bit too daring, since the left group is still unstable. However, what I tried, turned against me.

djna:  Well at first sight i it's something of an overplay. He didn't defend against A so the marked left group should be weak and the marked stone is quite a way from the group at the top.

Normally we would now lean on one weak group in order to gain strength and then attack the other. I've looked at several different  approaches to doing that and haven't found anything very good.

The difficulty is that the C5 and Q17 groups are both pretty solid so that they support the weak groups.

I would play as shown in the variation - stabilise my weaknesses and hope to get get a chance to be more active later. This really reflects that W has a pretty ropy position.]

(;W[ch];B[ef];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd];B[eb]C[
djna: problem now is that W has too mant groups to look after,

proverb: if you have six groups on the board one of them is dead.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[fc];B[fb];W[jb];B[id];W[jc];B[ha]TR[id]C[
djna: what now? How to deal with the threat of B setting the marked stone in motion?]
;W[db];B[gb];W[eh];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh]TR[pb][qb][mc]
[pc]C[This built a wall, but drastically weakened my stones on the left...

djna: we should expect this kind of thing. We make strength for ourselves in one direction by conceding it somewhere else.

The marked group is now quite a bit weaker. So W needs to find a way to put some pressure on it.]

(;W[nd]C[
djna: this looks like a decent guess, but doesn't seem to work as well as we might expect.]
;B[md]LB[jd:B][me:A]TR[nd]C[djna: a very powerful response by B. The problem is that is the B wall gets higher at A then black can play B and B will be safe.

I can't find a good answer to B's move. So I just don't think that whites's marked move works. Could we tell that at the time we played it? Probably not. Sometimes all we can do is play the best guess we have. The marked move was one such guess.

Conclusion:  W's position was just too insecure, we need B to make a mistake - and he doesn't.

The variation shows a different guess.];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob]C[
djna: nice idea. But it assumes that B will be accommodating. Look at the variation for the next move.]

(;B[oc];W[mb];B[oa];W[lb]C[
djna: nice idea, but B too many weaknesses in W's possition something is going to break]
;B[ne];W[od];B[pd];W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[qe]TR[mc][md][ne]C[
djna: A little irritating to see B take a solid corner, but if W can capture the marked stones his position solidifies, so this is potentially a pretty nice result.]
;W[lg]LB[mf:A]TR[nc][nd][od][oe][of][pf]C[
djna: Usually, playing on a big scale like this is good, here it goes horribly wrong but I think that's because you make a mistake later.

A would be an alternative];B[mg];W[mf]C[I was unsure about this move, I thought it the only way to keep the black stones.

djna: it looks ok - cut across the knight's move];B[nf]
(;W[ng]C[Cut here, or at N15?

djna: This is the losing move. N15  works.];B[me];W[lf]C[I wasn't sure about this move, since Black could still cut even after I capture the stone....

djna: the possition just falls apart, one bad move caused it.]
;B[og];W[mh];B[qf]TR[bd][cf][ef][gf][gg][gh]C[After this (before this one rather), I thought the time was right to resign...(However, my opponent urged me to continue with the game, but that's a different matter)

djna: yes I would resign. The only way to win now is to attack the marked group. but it's clear that the two W stones on the left are just too weak.]
;W[dk]C[A desperate attempt, aiming at a large scale attack on Blak's floating group.

djna: a good way of undertaking the attack];B[bj];W[dl];B[cm]
;W[hi]LB[fi:A]TR[lf][mf][lg][ng][mh][oj][ok][pl][nm][om][pm]
[nn][no][oo]C[
djna: this is an important mistake in direction.

If the attack has any chance it's because W is now strong in the middle

So W must strengthen the weak group on the left by driving B towards strength.

I would play near A.];B[hh];W[ih];B[gi];W[hj];B[di]LB[ch:A]
TR[gf][gg][gh][gi]C[After this one, I knew the game was over.

But, is there any response to this move, that would actually enable me to capture the group?

djna: no, stone A is pivotal, once B built the wall W cannot expect to save it.]

;W[eg];B[ck]C[I'm very sure, this time without hope, that after this one, it was game over. No more chances...

djna: yes.];W[gj];B[fi];W[fl];B[ee];W[be];B[bf]C[I resigned here.

From what I played, I concluded that I'm not good at fighting.

However, I am not sure whether I -should- have resigned. I thought that if I got the center territory, the game would be rather close, though I am not sure....What would you think?

Thank you for your review!

djna: The W centre could make 50 points at most. The left and right sides are each 30 or 40 points and B has lots of sente yose. I think game over.

Overall W's problems began early when he made a rash cut at move 18.

To improve fighting : I suggest that W make a point of looking for two responses by the opponent to his moves. The proverb says "there are always two way to give atari" one meaning of this proverb is that we must avoid expecting the opponet to play the "obvious" move.

Good luck, and keep playing!])
