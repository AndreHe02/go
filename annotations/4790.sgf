C[This game was round 2 of the Kisei Tournament in the W and Y study group. Waya5field [10k\] happened to be the person running the tournament, and since my first opponent didn't show up, this was my first game. Both players made incredible mistakes, and the only reason I won, was because my mistakes were a little less devastating. The game was a fight from start to finish, which isn't really my style, so I wanted to review all my mistakes.

>> Hi, my name is Leon Geerdink and I will review your game. I'm around 3k on KGS. My nickname is Creslin. I will start my comments with >>. I will try to show you my ideas in this game.]

(;B[qg]TR[qc]LB[co:a][ec:b][oq:c][ic:d][id:e]C[My usual oogeima [large knight\] extension from the hoshi towards the white side. It's to avoid an invasion at R14 and having to respond at O17 and letting white have too much influence over the rest of the board. [See Variation\]

>> This is inconsistend with traditional Fuseki theory. According to theory, Black should either make a shimari (B), approach with a kakari (a and c) or play the chinese opening (d and e). The reason for this is that the Black corner in the upper right is still open to the 3-3 invasion.]
;W[nq]LB[ec:a]C[>> Because Black made the top interesting by making a corner enclosure I would prefer to approach at A.]
;B[id]C[I decided to do the chinese opening late]
(;W[ec]LB[co:a]C[>> This kakari in Blacks sphere of influence is too early. White will face a difficult fight.]

(;B[df]LB[dc:a]C[I thought a D17 move would have been better.

>> I agree. This move makes it easy for White to settle his stone at E17. See variation for standard Joseki. (a)]

(;W[hc]LB[cc:a]C[>> Without a Black move at D17, White can easily settle his stone at C17.
H17 will only help Black to become strong on the right side.]
;B[ic];W[hd]
(;B[do]LB[ie:a]C[>> To me the top still feels very urgent.]

(;W[co]LB[cm:a][dm:b][cl:c][dl:d][ck:e][dk:f]C[>> This helps Black to build his left side, which is the interesting side. My feeling tells me white should play a pincer, but I don't know which one is best.
A low pincer seems in order, because the D14 stone is high.]
;B[cn];W[cp]
(;B[dm]LB[dn:a]C[>>I would prefer the variation, because of the balance of high and low.]
;W[gq]TR[eq]LB[fq:a]C[>> Joseki mistake. White should play at F3.
This leaves a weakness at E3. (Aji(]
(;B[dj]C[A bit too conservative

>> Black could play Tenuki, but I think the real problem is that Black choose the wrong variation.]

(;W[jq]C[But white does the same thing

>> Very slow move by White. The top looks urgent, and the big point is on the right side. If white absolutely wants to play at the bottom K4 would have been better.]

(;B[qm]LB[qj:a]C[Only possible move in my opinion

>> This move is in the right direction (although I feel the  top is still urgent) but, this feels like an overplay. Black 21 is too close to the strong White possition at R4.]

(;W[qi]C[pretty odd invasion

>>White missed the invasion point at R9.];B[qk]C[I felt this was pretty slow, but if I didn't play it  I think my R7 stone would have been in some trouble]

(;W[nc]TR[ec][hc][hd][oi][qi]LB[ol:a]C[>> Feels like an overplay. White now has three weak groups]

(;B[lc]LB[pc:a]C[>> This looks best. Black Q17 is the usual play, but White will take the initiative on the top.]

(;W[ne]C[>> Difficult. This looks like an invitation for a splitting attack by Black, but Black also has two weak groups now. Fighting skill will determine the outcome here.  White could also invade the corner. If white invades the corner he settles one of his weak groups.]

(;W[pf]C[Even if White did not make this second mistake of filling in an inside liberty, I still would have won the race. O18 would have been better for white here. [See Variation\]]
;B[nb];W[sf]C[Useless];B[rf];W[sd]C[I'm betting he was hoping for a move at T15, which would have been a huge snapback.]
;B[mc]C[>> Very difficult game now for White. T17 will kill his corner group, but if W plays T17 Black will attack P10 for an easy victory.]
;W[mj]C[Probably necessary, since a black move there would have seriously endangered that group.]
;B[li];W[ib]C[Endgame move, but big if I ignore it.

>> Lower right still urgent. B can mount an attack, and it will be very difficult for White to live. B can still kill at T17.]
