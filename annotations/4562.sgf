C[Hello reviewer.

I find sometimes I play a game and I feel like I am ahead the whole game, only to find that in fact I have lost. Usually, in these cases, I have trouble understanding what went wrong. My position seems to slowly become worse, though probably it could have been better from the begining.

I'd like to understand where I am loosing my advantage, or where I am not understanding that a position is actually not as good as I think it is.

Thank you,
-Dave Felcan.


Empiror: in weiqi, feel is the subtle but important factor. even 9ps can have different feels about the same situation before the game ends. the accuracy of your feel indicates your strength. computers don't have decent feel about weiqi, no suprise they do poorly:). u can improve your feel by reading go books, playing and reviewing games and most of all, adjusting your feel at all time. you need to have doubt about your judgement and the courage to correct it when it turns out wrong. I will try to talk more about feel in this review.]

;W[og];B[ng];W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg]C[I felt this was good top territory for me.

Emp: ya, becos w didn't gain anything during the process. if u got 5 points, ur opponent got 8, that's bad, if u got 2 points, he 1, that's good. that's how to see the trade. but, were u worried about the life of ur group at the right side?]

Black is behind? Only seemed like one mistake - p3 - and that was compensated for.

Emp: w leads with much more than 5 pts. u missed w's lower right points.

"only one mistake"? I doubt even if Master Wu Qinyuan can say that about any of his games... on the contrary, i heard that some 9ps say that weiqi is all about making mistakes in turn, only when u make smaller mistakes than your opponent does, u win. i don't think they were being modest, they were just being realistic.]

Emp: b didn't lead for the most of the game. you need to improve your appreication of situations and the balance of exchanges. and u must increase ur threshold of feeling good during the game.
