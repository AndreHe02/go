C[Hi,
Thanks in advance for reviewing my game. I played B in this game and made some dreadful errors particularly at the top half of the board it what might otherwise have been a close game. I would greatly appreciate some comments on my opening play and also how I should have handled the battle at the top half of the board]

(;B[hj]C[Is this enclosure a bit too awkward?

It depends on your motive. This kind of pattern indicates that black is aiming for center territory. To get territory at the sides, K3 would be a better move as this configuration still allows white to cut in below.

Usually, people will try to claim the territory at the 4 sides before turning their attention to the center.]
;W[hc];B[jk]C[I think B should have played this earlier

Indeed. If you B played this earlier, the next move could be at G3 which would give you the entire bottom. Now, there is a space at F3 for white to penetrate. Also, the lower right is overconcentrated.]
;W[lg];B[mi]C[NEVER play on the first line except during endgame.]
;W[hg];B[gf]C[Actually, you should play somewhere at the bottom. C3 is still a good point for white to attack.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[ff];W[ee]
(;B[eh]TR[ff][gf]C[In retrospect I think this was a mistake. It allowed W to cut off the 2 marked stones with the next move. The battle would probably have progressed in a totally different direction

Yes. B should play at G7 instead. This will give B a chance to penetrate W territory. (see variation)]
;W[gg];B[if]C[This is no good. W can crush B and strengthen his own territory at the same time. A better move would be at K7 where W has to defend.

Also, remember that the bottom left is still not secure.];W[ig]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[id]C[There is no way B can live here.];W[ic]
;B[jd];W[je];B[kf];W[kg];B[le];W[jh];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc]
(;W[jc]C[This is a mistake by W. (see variation for correct play)]

(;B[hd]C[This is not the way. (see variation for the appropriate method)]
;W[ke]C[Now the chance is gone.];B[gc];W[gd];B[jb]
(;W[hb]C[This is not a good move by W. It forms an ugly shape. (see variation for correct move for W)]
;B[ed]SQ[ee][ef]C[I think this move made up for Black's earlier mistake of permitting G7. Capturing the 2 marked stones would allow the 2 stranded black stones to  reconnect]
;W[fd];B[de];W[fc];B[fe];W[hf];B[cd];W[dd];B[ec]C[This is small move. C11 would be better.]
;W[eb];B[ee];W[ge];B[db]C[C11 still better as it allows B to get the left side.]
;W[cc];B[fb];W[gb];B[bf];W[be];B[cb];W[bc];B[fa]C[Go straight to E13 for the kill. This wastes 1 move.]
;W[cf]
(;B[bg]C[Another bad move here. Allows W to penetrate. (see variation)]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[cg];W[dh];B[di];W[gi];B[fi]
;W[fj];B[fh];W[gh];B[ei];W[cj];B[ch];W[bb]C[Now the open space at the bottom left give W the opportunity to cause trouble.]

(;B[ek]C[Cutting at G4 is a better move as it cuts off penetration by W. (see variation)]
;W[gj];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[bl];W[cm];B[al]
;W[dk];B[fl];W[gl];B[gm]C[Don't play at the first line. Connecting at E4 is more important.]
;W[ej];B[hl];W[fk]
(;B[el];W[gk];B[fm];W[hk];B[jl]C[I think B managed to prevent further encroachment at the lower right with this move

B could have prevented it a long time ago. (see variation at move 83)]
;W[ij]
(;B[md]C[In the post game discussion, it was pointed out that this was a dreadful mistake. How should I have secured the corner?

see variation for the answer];W[lb];B[ba];W[ae]
(;B[kb]C[I think B made another dreadful mistake here, and should have concentrated on killing W at the top left

You are correct.];W[mb];B[mc];W[la];B[mg];W[lh];B[mf];W[mh]
;B[ha];W[ga];B[ea];W[ia];B[li];W[ab]C[I think this was the last nail in B's coffin]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[il];B[hm];W[ik];B[im];W[aa];B[ca];W[af]
;B[ag]C[I think B made some dreadful errors at the top half. Allowing the top right group to die and failing to kill W at the top left were more that enough to seal B's fate

Mistakes were made by both W and B. However, both sides also failed to capitalize on the mistakes by the opponent. In my review, I have included variations that shows how both sides could have played.

If you have any other questions, feel free to drop me an email.
