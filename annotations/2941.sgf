AB[pd][dp]C[I'm playing black in this game.  I was rated 2k at the time and playing against a shodan.  I am slowly but surely outmaneuvered and my move 100 I'm probably already lost.  Where did I go wrong?]
PL[W];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc];B[df];W[jd];B[nq]C[Is this right?  Perhaps I should play m17 instead?  How bad is it to let white play both f17 and o17?
JH : 6 is playable but M17 or N17 are perhaps a little better.]
;W[nc];B[pn]C[Trying to make the most of o3.  Perhaps I should just play r14 instead, then if white r6, black k4 and I still have a nice formation.
JH : still OK. R14 is good also];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[pq]
C[13 : Overplay. Black shoul cut.];B[kq];W[po]C[Exchanging 14 for 15, you lost  some points]
;B[qi]C[Trying to do two things at once.  Is it efficient or is it ineffective?
It looks OK for me];W[qn];B[qm]C[r7 should tenuki.  Perhaps c6?
JH : You can tenuki abd play C10. I think it easier to win with this move]
;W[rn]C[Black should be happy with this kikashi and play elsewhere]
;B[pm];W[rm];B[mo]C[No need to play here];W[nm];B[mn];W[om]
C[Now I've weakened my own three stones, and for what?  Perhaps n5 should just be s8?
N5 should be C10. S8 is not a good point];B[pf]C[Not bad];W[ch]
;B[ck]C[Not sure why c9 instead of d9.  I think I'm playing fearfully...
JH : Both are OK];W[dc];B[cc];W[db]C[W31 : Strange move.];B[cd]
C[Is this proper shape?  Should it be c15 instead?
JH : It looks OK];W[bf];B[eh]C[34 : the shape is not so good.
I think playing E13 or C13 and D12 are better];W[di];B[ek];W[ei]
;B[bi]C[Is this premature?  Should be at f12?
JH : Yes. F12 is normal];W[fh];B[eg];W[fi];B[cb]C[42 : Black should go out now.G14]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[dn]C[White is pushing it a bit now, I think.

White is trying too much. I agree];B[co];W[cn];B[gk]C[No!  The corner is much weaker and the line-9 group is further into the center than white's three stones.  Should be e5, probably.
JH : Or simply F4, the regular move.];W[ep];B[eo]C[50 : This is where you loose the game. Should be simply at E3]
;W[do];B[cp];W[eq];B[dq]C[Ugh];W[dr];B[cr];W[er];B[cs]C[B58 : B3 look better]
;W[fn]C[ouch];B[fo]C[refusing to admit defeat!
JH : Ok it is a mistake];W[go];B[hq]C[finally admitting defeat!]
;W[gq];B[hp]C[gote.  Should tenuki to...h16 or h17?

H17 is the point there but it is not possible with Black weak group.]
;W[ii];B[gf]C[now the line-9 stones are becoming weak.  g14 just let's white defend the weakness at h16.]
;W[fe];B[fg];W[hd];B[ik];W[in]C[W71 is not so good. H5 is simple.]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[hn]C[74 : Good You recover.];W[fl];B[fk];W[ig]
;B[if]C[May be playing at C14, B13 and B15 is easier.];W[hg]
;B[hf];W[gg];B[ff];W[ee];B[cg]C[84 : Bad shape : should be played at C14. May be the loosing move.]
;W[bh];B[lc]C[In light of future events, this should probably be a connection to the UL corner...
JH : Yes you have to connect your stones and be more patient.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[be];W[bg];B[jf];W[ld];B[lf];W[md];B[oc]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[qk]C[For White 014 is a sente point.];B[nd];W[ne]
;B[od];W[mc];B[me]C[taking gote again to connect -- but not securely.  Probably just playing o14 is more solid, although it is also gote and threatens nothing.
JH : O14 looks better];W[oj]C[It looks close, but white has a lot of sente endgame plays...]
