C[Hello,

I will try to provide usefull comments.
I will also make comments on black moves if they have some importance.

I'ts good that you reviewed your game before posting it.];B[pq]
C[ ===================================
bluenight [25k?\]: I will begin my comments here
 ============================
bluenight [25k?\]: I played as white. I wanted to fight early on because I'm not good at it. I'd like to get better. I also wanted to agitate the other player.]

should have been at F4];W[ck]MA[dk]C[good, D9 also good.];B[oh]
C[This black move achieves nothing efficient :
- no territorry
- no effect on the white stones];W[qe]C[excellent];B[kj]C[same comment ...
should have been K4];W[qh]C[good as well.

you may think to invade the black formation soon];B[qi];W[ri]
;B[pi];W[rh]MA[jq]C[this is not needed yet.
you could play elsewhere.];B[ph]TR[oh][pi]C[yuck again : an other empty triangle]

should have been M3];W[hp]SQ[jo][kj][pi][pq][qi][qo]MA[lp]C[Since you have plenty of space for living, I would have pushed the other way, within the black formation.

the way you play it, black can start sealing its 'moyo' with a play at L4]
;B[kp]
(;W[kq]C[hmmm, K3 better, because B cannot atari on K4 then ... (see variation)]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[iq];W[ko]C[good reading if you fully read it ...
(so you are not that bad at fighting)];B[lp];W[io];B[jn];W[hq]
;B[ir];W[hr];B[jr];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[js];B[ln];W[fo]
C[ah, first mistake :

this does not do anything :
- your H3 group is alive, so there is no need to connect it to an other group
- same with the D5 stones : they don't need to be defended now (they are not attacked, andif they are later, they can either be connected with F5, or live with the C9 stone)
- this does not provide any additionnal territory to white.]
;B[ho];W[is]SQ[cp][dp][dq]TR[ko]LB[nr:D][qj:A][qk:B][rk:C]C[bluenight [25k?\]: Here, I think I should've extended the stone in atari instead of capturing group J3. At this point, it looks like black has alot of territory in the bottom right and towards the center. I didn't look at this at all when I was fighting on the bottom.

==================================
yes, you could have extended the J5 stone.

at this point, you are *largely* ahead.

the black territorry can be invaded very easily with a move at A, B or C.
Even, if you can read it, you can also invade at D because of the triangle stone (but as an exercise, I'll let you find out how).

further more, the square marked stone are beginning to feel very weak.]
;B[in];W[go]C[again, useless];B[ip];W[iq]C[not needed.];B[io]

Any point on the goban is more interesting ...];W[mq];B[nr]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[rk]C[aahh : good !];B[qk];W[jd]MA[ql]C[this was a very big point.

However, you shoud have continued you idea first (at go, it is not a good thing to abandon a plan in the middle).

So you can keep putting the pressure, and keeping the initiative with a play at R8]
;B[ep]C[double yuck : 2 empty triangles in the same shape !]
;W[fm]MA[ce][ec][ql]C[ok, but small];B[gm];W[gn]TR[fo][go]C[common ...]

;B[no]MA[db][fc][jc]C[small];W[rm]MA[ql]C[ok, but I prefer Q8]
;B[rj];W[sj]C[bluenight [25k?\]: I tried to agitate black again by invading. I think I should've focused more on how the outside wall black was building (in response to my invasion) was giving it enormous influence combined with the black stone near the center star point.
=====================================

that is true, and that is why you should have been much more severe when invading, and also protect your top side with a play at E17]
;B[qj]
(;W[rl]C[R8 more severe];B[qm];W[rn]SQ[jd]MA[mh]C[too small

The black moyo is still open to invasion and you have a supporting stone, so you can (you probably need) to play around N12]
;B[qn];W[ro];B[rp];W[jg]SQ[gm][kj][oh]MA[hl][ik][il][jj][jk]
[li][lj][mh][mi][nh]C[good, but you can go further.

The rule says that you should be on the line between the B extreme stones.]
;B[jh];W[ih]C[bluenight [25k?\]: From here on I really tried to prevent black from gaining anymore territory or expanding

====================================

ok, but the top is still invadable, so a play at E17 would be more efficient.
(there is more to protect by white than to prevent by black).]

Furthermore, the M11 stone has some aji ...];B[em];W[dm]C[bluenight [25k?\]: I think I should've connected at F6. I'm not sure... I didn't connect because I thought it was a bad shape.
===================================

eh, it was 'already' a bad shape (empty triangle)];B[fn];W[en]
C[this is a very good shape move - (though it is small).

the reason is, if B connects, he has a lot of bulkt stones, and if he does not, you take 2 stones and get a wonderfull shape.]
;B[fm];W[eo]C[not needed, but ok];B[ek];W[dl];B[ej]MA[ei]C[slow]

(;B[fj]C[black can take this stone by playing at G10];W[gk]

;B[gj];W[hk];B[hj];W[gi]TR[ej][ek][fj][gj][hj]C[bluenight [25k?\]: I gave up on trying to connect.

=====================================

yes, better give up than letting B enforce himself.
However, this achives almost nothing.];B[ik]C[useless, the stones are dead as they are]

====================================

no, atari at P18 does the job];B[ka];W[jb];B[ic];W[ja];B[dc]
C[bluenight [25k?\]: in the next few moves, black makes life in the corner. I would really like to know how I could have stopped that. I would also like to know if I could have destroyed the black group in the bottom left corner (A1-E4)

======================================

1) D17 is a standard attack to try to make life.
It is difficult to stop.
This is why an earlier play at E17 would have been necessary.

2) the bottom left group is alive as is]
(;W[ec]C[ok, this is rather difficult :
you should get where black has the most chances to live, and push him where he has few chances to live.

a corner is easier to live in, so a play at C17 is better (see variation)]

;W[sk];B[sm];W[si];B[gr];W[hs];B[tt];W[dk];B[tt];W[tt]C[bluenight [25k?\]: In most of my games, it looks like I try to take only the safe positions (corner and sides). I think I'm afraid of venturing into the center, or entering what looks like black territory.

Ok, you won and that is a good thing, because if not for the last B blunder, you might have lost a game that was so largely in your favor that losing it would have been a scandal ...

Basically, getting for sides and corners is not a bad thing.
However, it is not normal that with such a difference of skills (B played very ugly shapes, and a bunch of useless moves), the score is so tight.

You should not have let B make this big moyo in the centre, and be more aggressive when trying to get in (moves 56, 68, 72,  98, 140).

Also, a couple of unefficient moves (42 46, 48, 60,104, 108) did let B take some ease.


Overall, you played fairly well and nicely balanced stones, you as you say, you sould not be afraid to venture in the centre, or within black formation *when and only when* you have support for it.


Hope this helped.
