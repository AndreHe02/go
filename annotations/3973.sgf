Game m23413-onesickpup(B) IGS
Both players 6k IGS
Reviewed for Black

I am Amygdala, 2k IGS and will mark my comments with "A:".
I will mark the comments of the black player with "B:".
It goes without saying that I can only offer my humble opinion and cannot claim that they render the absolute truth...
This will be my first review for GTL and I will try to do my very best.
I hope you will enjoy it.

A:
The commentary is expected to focus on the fuseki.
It is a good idea to experiment with various fusekis and try to find out what suits you best.]
;B[pp]C[A:
An old custom demands that you play your first move in the upper right corner. That way your partner (the putative cocreator of a piece of art rather than an opponent) does not to have to reach out far with his right hand to play his stone, but has the option of placing it in the corner next to his hand with least effort.
Kobayashi once ignored that custom in a contest with Takemiya, which was understood as a subtle offence and raised quite an uproar.
The custom was developped at physical boards, but it seems nice to transfer it into the virtual world.]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pd]
(;B[cg]C[B:
To understand this move you have to be aware of the ongoing debate between the  traditional Kobayashi fuseki and the newer version.  Im trying to get a good version of both at the expense of a large and secure white corner.

A:
It looks strange, though. The traditional move c14 puts more pressure on the corner stone while yours can be ignored
(the variation shows one example of the traditional Kobayashi fuseki).
It is correct to play on the left side (instead of e.g. r14), as black can get an ideal formation with a shimari on e3 or e4.]
;W[ep]C[B:
I think c15 is simple and puts black to the test.

A:
I do not think so. c15 would feel a little submissive. 
Try tewari: if white had a stone on c15, would he answer black c13 with d16?
White uses the fact that c13 does not put much pressure on the corner and takes the initiative.]
;B[hp]
(;W[cq]C[A:
This move is considered to be unfavourable for white and therefore it is not joseki.
e6 would be nice enough, since black does not feel good when he is forced to add another stone on the third line on the left side with c6 (see variation).]
;B[bq];W[dq];B[bo]C[A:
This result is considered bad for white, as white f5 next does not have the double threat potential which it owns when h4 is replaced by g3 (in the variation white cannot extend towards the right side and does not threaten the high h4 stone).]

(;W[cn]C[A:
Hits the vital point of the black group indeed.
I tried to work out several variations resulting from the black answers at d5 or e5.
Things get really complicated, and for the variations given I can claim neither completeness nor correctness.
Apart from d5 or e5, you could consider a sequence which is borrowed from the corresponding ikken basami joseki, given in the variation (starting with c7).
Summarizing, I think that black d5 is the strongest answer and white e5 the strongest resistance in response to that.
All results are better for black, and that is why c3 is not joseki.]

(;B[cj]C[B:
Probably the result of a hallucination.  I thought my group would be cut off and in an unfavorable semeai if I played on e5.

A:
e5 really ends in complicated and unfavourable positions for black. c10, however, is bad in any case. It comes from the wrong direction. As you already found out, d5 instead would have been best.
Try a new strategic approach: do nothing but keep your groups connected.]
;W[bn]C[A:
This white move manages to separate black's groups along the left side.
Neither d5 nor e5 next work properly anymore. B2 also does not work (see variations).]

(;B[co];W[do];B[br];W[ao]C[A:
The cut at d2 next does not work for black (see variation).]

(;B[ap]
(;W[an]C[B: 
a2 and a6 are miai.

A:
You are right.];B[ar];W[dm]C[B: 
I think this actually qualifies as a joseki now because of our mutually bad moves.

A:
Well, it is not really to be called a joseki, since white has come out much better than deserved and absolutely better than black. The black corner group comprises a territory of three points maximally and is completely inactivated, whereas white has connected all his stones, deleted black's left side and devaluated the h4 stone. The seven black corner stones have hardly any influence on the following game: it is almost as if you had passed seven times!]
;B[fc]C[A:
Good.]
(;W[df]C[B:  
Im not sure what white's best move would be here, tenuki maybe.  I think most pro's make an effort not to get in this situation.

A:
It is funny that pros hardly come into these situations that trouble us poor amateurs... Probably they have the better yomi... So what do we have instead (see variations)?
My favorite is c17: It settles the situation and does not strengthen black in the surroundings.
But it is gote.];B[dg];W[ef];B[db];W[cf];B[ej];W[cc];B[ic]
(;W[mc]TR[jp][kp][lp][mp][np][nq]C[B:
I would have gone for something in the triangled area.

A:
I would have approached from the other side
(see variation).]
(;B[kp]C[A:
The wrong side. R10 or a kakari against the North-Eastern corner look nice (see variations).
I prefer R10.
If at all in the region you chose, than on the third line.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[pn]C[B:  
I was thinking r15 as being an interesting move.

A:
That would be too passive. A kakari feels right, but I would have chosen the low one at r6.]
;B[np]
(;W[pj]C[B:
I think r4 is the move here.

A:
White thinks of q6 as a forcing move, which is good. But the low move a r10 would be more flexible.]
;B[rd];W[qf]C[B: 
r16.

A:
That would be stronger, indeed.];B[qc]C[B: 
I actually wasn't sure how to respond to r14.

A:
San-san is alright.];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob]
(;B[qb]C[A:
Usually at s18 (see variation).];W[nn];B[qn];W[qm];B[qo];W[ln]
C[B: 
s7 had to be played, or find a better tenuki.

A:
q7 leaves less aji.];B[ql]C[B: 
Maybe cutting on q7.

A:
No, the clamp is fine.];W[pl];B[rm];W[pm];B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[rk]C[B: 
I admit this looks strange by I am trying to be conscious of his growing center.  I'm aiming at r11 some day.

A:
You do not have to hope f√ºr r11 in the future if you can have s10 right now!]
;W[jd]C[B:  
He makes a lot of contact plays like this which I think more times than not just worked out badly for him.

A:
White is far behind in territory and he stakes his hopes on a center moyo and he choses the right direction. That is not bad.]
;B[id];W[ie]
(;B[je]C[A:
Risky. Black will have to fight within white's sphere of influence, and such a fight is what white needs.
A reducing move from your strong side first would be safer. You can jump in as far as k10 (see variation).]
;W[kd];B[jf];W[he];B[cb]
(;W[bb]C[A:
I am asked to do the commentary for black, so I will not focus on how white could have done better. Just one hint: think about k12 (see variations).]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[hf];W[gf]
(;B[gd]C[A:
The proverb says: "Do not peep at a cutting point." Rather cut there later on if you can! Instead of g16, try something more dynamic. L5, for instance (see variation).]
;W[ge]
(;B[ji]C[A:

;B[jk]C[A:
Well done, black is out and white can hardly hope to get much center territory.]
;W[kh];B[jh]C[A:
Bad shape, an empty triangle. Cannot be avoided in the long run and is the successor of the previous bad shape move. Bad shape is like an avalanche... Once you got it, it will haunt you.]

Here I felt a lot of relief because I felt sure I could make both of my groups  (on c13 and j12) live or connect.

A:
You are ahead in territory and you can afford to play safe.]

C[B: 
I was surprised the score was as close as it was.  I think white could have come very close if not for some really careless moves.

A:
We should not scold white. Amateurs all make careless moves all over, and often enough only luck decides which direction the game takes.]
;W[bc];B[tt];W[tt]C[A:
So black wins with a margin of 10.5 points (he had to give 6.5 komi).
In the end, a short summary:
1.
If you hold black, always play the first move in the upper right corner.
2.
Go on and try different fusekis to find out which one suites you best. It is fun to play different fusekis against partners you know. I can only encourage that.
3.
I do not think that c13 in that game is a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on the Kobayashi fuseki. What is the opinion of  your local sensei or your local sempais?
4.
Try to improve your feeling for the proper direction. If you have not already done so, read Kajiwara's "The direction of play". Very difficult sometimes, but probably a nice inspiration that will increase your awareness for the problem.
5.
Learn more about good shape. Studying josekis is useful for that. On the other hand, it might be as easy as to "Avoid empty triangles!".

It was great fun for me to review your game! Thank you very much for the opportunity to do so!]
