>> most interested in strategic errors

MR: Hi David,
please find my comments in the sgf below.

As you already indicated yourself, "strategy" appears to be one of the main problems in this game. 
I found many "not ideal" moves already in the very beginning of the game and tried to give you an idea why other moves with other ideas might be better.

In the game, the main topic was your weak group in the lower left. In your attempts to save this group, white got strong with all of his weak groups and could set the path to victory for him. 

I put some strategic considerations into the comment that might give you an idea of some - easy - strategic considerations. My suggestion is that you try to take pauses in your next games when coming into similar situations and to try to take similar strategic considerations yourself.

I only made very short comments to the life and death problems that appeared move 100 to 200, as I feel that they were not the topic of the game and not the main area for improvement.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]
(;B[qm]C[MR: Correct direction, but not the ideal place. 
Better R8 to attack the white stones.
In situations when it is more important to secure the corner, R6 is better.]
;W[lc];B[of]C[MR: Most people would probably pincer with J17 or K17.]
;W[ic]
(;B[fc]C[MR: If you want to attack the white stones, then you need to play G17 locally. However, the white stones cannot be attacked strongly because white can slide to O18. Therefore, better play at another area of the board. One idea would be to follow up P14 by attacking the white stones on the right side. Second idea would be to build a bigger area of influence on the lower side with K4.]
;W[qi]
(;B[le]C[MR: What is the reasoning behind this move? 
If you want to attack white, you have to reduce the base with N17, M16. But it is anyway a strange plan as the white group is rather strong and black lacks good continuations.]
;W[ie];B[ce]C[maybe too slow?

MR: Not topic of the game now. I would suggest K4 to build a larger area of influence. If you absolutely want to close a corner, P3 is better.]
;W[fq];B[jq];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm]
(;B[co];W[en];B[do];W[cm]
(;B[fp]C[MR: A calm (and a little slow) continuation would be D2.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[er]
(;B[ci]C[MR: Black should first play in the corner with D2. This also serves as an attacking move against the lower white group.]
;W[cq]C[MR: What is the current status of the groups in the lower left?
- The black group is floating eyeless.
- The white group on the left side is weak.
- The white group on the lower side is (nearly) alive.

So black needs to find a way to settle himself and at the same time attack the white group(s), preferably the white group on the left side. 

G6 is an easy way for black to poke his head out into the center and at the same time to keep the white groups separated. G6 has threats to both sides as shown in the variations.

It is definitely *not* a good idea to play in the corner if you cannot read that you definitely get two eyes there (here, you do not even get one eye, but strengthens white considerably).]

(;B[dq];W[dr];B[bq];W[br];B[bn];W[bm];B[bp];W[an]C[MR: What is the status of the three groups in the lower left now?

- Black is even weaker than before.
- The white group on the lower side is (nearly) alive.
- The white group on the left side is alive when capturing with B5.

This situation is worse than the situation was before you played D3 ff.
This shows why D3 ff were bad.];B[io];W[hn]
(;B[go]C[MR: Do not push into a knight move if you do not want to cut!

Instead, think about playing F7 directly (alternatively, think about G6). I inserted some variations for F7.]
;W[ho];B[fm];W[hp]
(;B[gm]C[MR: Unneccessary. The cut does not work anyway.];W[pq]

;B[op];W[ei]
(;B[ek]C[MR: What is the meaning of this move?

In my opinion, it only invites white to play D10, a move he wanted to play anyway. 
The only sensible reason for playing in this area of the board is in my opinion that you want to separate E11 from the left side white group. In this case, think about E10.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[il];W[em]C[MR: This white move is very strange as black already jumped to the outside with J8.]
;B[jm]C[MR: Good.];W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[ip];W[jo]C[options for black?]

(;B[hq]C[MR: ???
You need to separate with J6!];W[in]
(;B[kq]C[MR: ???];W[iq];B[ir];W[gk];B[hl];W[gq];B[lo]C[MR: ???
You should hold in for a moment and think about what you want to reach strategically. Your center black group is still not alive while all white groups are rather save. Instead of pushing white towards your weak group you should stabilize this group directly (as most bad developments in the game came from you under attack, you should think about ways so that your groups do not come under attack so often).]

;W[nm];B[ok];W[mj]C[her black decides to sacrifice 3 stones for safety.  but maybe he should fight with S9?

MR: Why do you only *now* think about the status of your center group? Think about it *before* you start fights with P8 ff.

MR: I stop the comment here as there were already many strategic faults up to here where you can work on. In the remainder, I will only answer your directly posed questions.]
;B[kj];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[nj];B[kh];W[cc]
C[unexpected.  how to reply?

MR: D17 is ok. The result of the corner invasion depends on the surrounding. White will most likely try to reach a ko with D18, B18.]

;B[ob]C[again, black decides to give up corner in return for outside.  but maybe this is not a good strategy unless he kills the M17 group?

MR: Yes, this is *not* a good strategy. Q18 is better.];W[oc]
;B[nc];W[pb];B[mb];W[oa];B[mc];W[qc];B[kc];W[kd];B[ld]C[mistake? descending at L18 better?

MR: I do not think so. But you have to read in detail. Be aware that W M16 might have implications to the center black group!]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[ke];B[kf];W[gb]C[now white lives and black has given up the corner for nothing. or is there still an attack?

MR: Difficult. Looks like 6Dan go problem. 
I will not try to work it out now as this kind of life and death problem are not the main area of improvement for you in my opinion.]
