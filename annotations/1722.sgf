RE[B+Resign]

C[hi!

Thank you for reviewing this game. I played white. I think i played to aggressive and to unflexible. I think the whole time about attacking and did not see the large territoy for black. finally the week black group live and i lost.


Hello, I hope you can profit by my comments. Comments will be preceeded with [chingu\].]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[dc];W[ep];B[jp];W[de];B[gd]LB[cc:a]C[kosekis joseki-dictionary does not know this move.

[chingu\]:
I have not seen this move either but it looks ok. The normal response at a (C17) is enough.]
;W[cc];B[dd]LB[cb:a]C[[chingu\]:
Bad style. Better hane at a (C18) to leave the possibility to extend into the corner.]
;W[cd]
(;B[cf];W[ce]C[better for white or for black?

[chingu\]:
Much better for white! A cut is always a potential threat (aji). An example is given in the variation earlier, but there are many ways how this cut can be effective for black later in the game.
Furthermore, the black shape is horrible.];B[cn]LB[cp:a]C[[chingu\]:
Playing at a (C4) is possible too.];W[cp];B[ck];W[pj];B[oc]
;W[pe]LB[ld:a]C[[chingu\]:
Maybe a bit too slow. I would like to play a pincer around a (M16) and try take advantage of the bad black shape in the following fight (but this seems to be a matter of taste).]
;B[ld];W[qn];B[nq];W[on]LB[ci:a]C[[chingu\]:
Another idea is to play at a (C11) to both threaten the two black stones and to prepare an invasion of the upper side. The value of the white move is not clear. Try to play moves with concrete meaning.]
;B[ph]LB[gq:a][qb:b]C[[chingu\]:
Is this necessary? Black can keep the game simple with the big moves of a (G3) and b (R18). An invasion is always a risk.]

(;W[nh]C[maybe to aggressive?

[chingu\]:
Difficult to say. See the variation for the previous move for another idea.]
;B[oh];W[ng];B[oj];W[pk];B[oi]LB[ni:a][of:b]C[[chingu\]:
A (O11) is better shape. The follow-up at b (P14) becomes very severe then.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[mn]LB[ll:a]C[[chingu\]:
This move has the drawback of weakening the white center stones. Attacking further with a (M8) looks better, white gets stronger in the center.]
;B[ml];W[lq];B[qp]LB[lp:a]C[[chingu\]:
Trying to connect with a (M4) is usually better than accepting to be shut in.]
;W[lo]
(;B[gq]C[[chingu\]:
Black creates another weak group. This is not very good.];W[eq]
LB[fo:a][ci:b]C[[chingu\]:
Better at a (F5). Black then has three weak groups and the move at b (C11) becomes even more forceful. White's move here is purely defensive, although white thinks about attacking - try to be consequent.]
;B[kl];W[jn];B[go];W[il];B[lj]LB[of:a]C[[chingu\]:
Due to white's attack from the wrong side the three white center stones become weak. A (P14) becomes a threat.]
;W[en];B[gm]
(;W[hn]C[this move leads to a sequence where i catch one stone in the end, but this was maybe to small? better to play as in the variation?

[chingu\]:
Catching one stone is definitely too small. The varation is much better, attack the whole group.]
;B[gn];W[hp]LB[el:a]C[[chingu\]:
There is still the possibility to play at a (E8) and continue to attack.]
;B[gp];W[ip];B[ir];W[hr];B[hq];W[jr];B[iq];W[jq];B[hm];W[in]
;B[em]C[now black has settled his week group.

[chingu\]:
Black now has settled TWO weak groups! White lost much with this sequence.]
;W[pr]C[stupid move.

[chingu\]:
Premature.];B[or];W[of]C[to slow? better at A?

[chingu\]:
This move is slow indeed, but covering this weakness becomes necesseray. A (O15) seems to be better shape, though.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[kg];B[ji];W[ig];B[gi]LB[hi:a]C[[chingu\]:
When being attacked, play solidly! A (H11) leaves less weakness.]
;W[ki]LB[jc:a][jd:b][fc:c]C[this was wrong, i think. i removed most of the cutting aji. i did not see the obvious answer.

[chingu\]:
I would rather break up the upper side with a (K17) or b (K16). Black's stones in the upper left become weak due to the weakness at c (F17), so white can reduce in sente.]
;B[jj];W[gg]C[a bad move again. i played to single-minded about attacking the black center-group. but maybe  there is no way to attack it profitable now?

[chingu\]:
There is no way to gain here immediately. If you encounter such a situation, play somewhere else (tenuki). Do not try to kill groups.
Splitting the upper side is very important now.];B[jc]LB[ic:a]
C[now black has a big territorial lead.

[chingu\]:
This is very big! But white at a (J17) looks interesting.];W[dh]
LB[bh:a][ch:b]C[[chingu\]:
Too easy for black, a reduction at a (B12) works very well. Better take the territory more firmly with b (C12).]
;B[ch]C[maybe an error. the single black stone is not worth to rescue it.

[chingu\]:
This is not small. If black is confident that he can live in the center, this move is good.]
;W[ci];B[bh];W[cj];B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh];B[ee];W[ef];B[fe]
;W[fg];B[bj]C[[chingu\]:
Strong move!];W[dk];B[cl];W[ej];B[db];W[bf];B[bi];W[gk]LB[qi:a]
C[now i have again an opportunity to attack, but now i have to kill the large group to win, because there is no way to profit from the attack. right?

[chingu\]:
White can maybe profit on the right side, taking black's eyespace with moves like a (R11). White is behind, but there is still a chance.]
;B[li];W[lh]LB[kh:a]C[[chingu\]:
Better connect solidly at a (M12).];B[jl];W[ik];B[fk];W[gj]
;B[mi];W[jk];B[kk];W[mk];B[im]LB[jm:a]C[[chingu\]:
Black should not play such moves until the center group is definetly alive. Maybe a (K7) becomes curcial for life later. This potential is now destroyed and the gain is not clear (aji-keshi).]
;W[jm];B[hk];W[ij];B[hi];W[hj];B[fj];W[fi];B[nm];W[nn]LB[ol:a]
C[[chingu\]:
Better play flexibly at a (P8) and take some profit while attacking.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[pl];B[qm]
(;W[pn]C[wrong? better at A? can black live with the center-group, if white plays A? see variation.

[chingu\]:
I don't think white can kill black, but the move in the variation is still better since it captures the two black stones more firmly.]
;B[rm]C[[chingu\]:
Now black can use his stones to build his second eye.];W[rn]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[ri];W[qi];B[sj];W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[qj];W[pi]
;B[rh];W[pg];B[qf];W[rf];B[qk];W[pf];B[ok];W[qe];B[mm]C[now black is alive.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[rr];B[pq];W[sq];B[qr];W[mc];B[md]C[at this point white resigned.

[chingu\]:
In this game, two principles were the most important:

1. Always attack from your weaker side, drive the opponent towards your strength.

2. Attack with a purpose. If you can not profit from your attack, leave the situation for later.]
