C[Hello, and thanks for reviewing this game!

Because this game was very close, I feel that I lost it in the endgame. However, I do know that I am not very good at reducing and invading my opponent's moyo, so this may be a more fundamental flaw with my play.

Any comments on mistakes or things that I could do better would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again,
Edward Ceaser


LF- Hello, I am Remi, nicknamed lefrog. My comments will start with LF. I'll try to show you that endgame is prepared right from the start, or at least, is something one has to think about right from the begining, with a few examples.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep];W[gq];B[er];W[eo];B[fo];W[fp]
;B[do];W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[en];W[jp]C[LF - This seems to be Ok]
;B[co]LB[bq:A]C[
LF - I'd play A because then white can have a way into black's area (later - endgame), see variation]

(;W[bp];B[bo]LB[br:A]C[LF - I think here A is better as It doesn' allow the variation, later (endgame again)  a gote/sente relationship]

(;W[cr]C[LF - See the variation for an endgame sequence]
(;B[dj]C[LF - I think this move is not good, too close to black's thickness. One plyas away from thickness (his own or his oponent's). Here, C14 would be appropriate. or C13.]
;W[cf]LB[cg:A]C[Although I came out of the previous exchange with the corner and influence on the bottom side, the entire left side ends up becoming territory for my opponent. I think that i was much too conservative with this move, and should have instead played at a much bigger point such as at Q10 or somewhere on the upper side

LF - I disagree.The area is important, and I might have played one line lower, at C13. The aim of this move is to counter the black influence, which it does quite well. Black was too conservative in playing D10.It is in my eyes, the most important point on the board.]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[pc]TR[jd]C[LF - I wouldn't attach as this settles the corner for good. I think K10 would be very nice here. Unless you know that you will end up with sente, and so can play at the bottom first.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[qd]
(;W[oc]LB[ob:A]C[LF - To make good shape, on usually plays at A (P18) here.]
;B[ic]
(;W[ld]C[LF - I find this move mild. It doesn't threaten black at all. The sequence in variation would be interesting for white.]
;B[fc]
(;W[eb]C[LF - I don't like this move too much,forcing white to an overcrowded position is better.]
;B[fb]C[LF - This is not so good, because of variation]
(;W[jc]C[LF - Attaching makes the oponent stronger. In this situation, black needs to be stronger, you're just helping him.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[jd];W[kd];B[kc];W[lc];B[jc];W[gd]TR[fe][go][nq]
C[LF - I think black is ok. no need for white to play here, it doesn't really help. I'd play at one of the marked points.]
;B[gc];W[ie];B[je];W[kf]C[These last three moves didn't do much but to strengthen my opponent's position. Perhaps I should have played elswhere instead.

LF - it didn't really strengthen him, as he answered when he didn't need to, but I agree, I'd play elsewhere. You can still wonder whether these "forcing moves" (forcing because he answered) were useful to you. if not, don't play them.]
;B[jf];W[nq]C[LF - There, this is better :)];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq]
;W[pl]C[LF - Maybe a bit early. I might play O5 and G5 first.]
;B[ql];W[om];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[dh]C[LF - I don't like this shape... black C13 or D13 leads to complications.]
;B[di]C[LF 6 I find black to be too cooperative, D13 was more interesting. Complex fighting.]
;W[dg];B[gp];W[go]C[LF - I think this is a mistake, white must play F3]
;B[fq];W[fr]
(;B[gn]C[LF - I think black should play H3 (see variation)]
;W[fp];B[ho];W[hp];B[fq];W[hr];B[io];W[ip];B[ne]
(;W[od]C[LF - This move doesn't help white. White lives with S18]
;B[oe];W[nf]C[LF - I don't understand this move.];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[og]
(;W[pk]LB[qk:A]C[LF - I would cut black in 2. R9 does that.]
;B[qm];W[qk];B[qj];W[oo];B[po];W[rr];B[rq];W[rl];B[rm];W[rj]
;B[ri];W[qi];B[qh]C[LF - I think here white must play atari. (see var)]

(;W[rh];B[pi];W[si];B[rg];W[qi];B[qg];W[jn]LB[fh:A][kn:B]C[At this point I figured thatthe left side and center was looking dangerously open, so I decided to use the influence I had towards the center on the right side to start building a large moyo.

LF - The top left corner is still undecided, yet your intention if good.I don't know whether this move or L6 or F12 is best, but the important is that you've seen something important and are trying to get to it.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[il];W[jl];B[ik];W[in];B[hm];W[gj]C[LF - Quite nice.]
;B[gh];W[ei];B[ej];W[fi];B[fj];W[gi];B[gk];W[hh];B[gf];W[he]

;W[db];B[bb];W[bc];B[ee];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[eg];W[fh]C[Although I was never really worried about coming out of this exchange in the upper left with a dead formation, I did have fairly significant amount of territory cut away from me, partly due to the original looseness of my formations that allowed my opponent to make many sente moves.


LF - Yes, and also due to E18];B[op];W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[ok]
;W[oj]
(;B[oi];W[nj];B[ni]
(;W[mh]C[LF - I don't understand this move. Once again, S18 lives. Taking territory with N10 seems better.]
;B[mj];W[nk]
(;B[mi]C[LF - Again, black is afraid of pushing first. See variation.]
;W[mk];B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[lj];B[lk];W[ll]C[I decided to play it safe by playing at M8 and allowing my opponent to connect, but, in hindsight, I might have been able to force him to struggle for life on the upper right side and use this to my advantage.

LF - I think the upper right side is ok, on eye at Q15, one at Q12.LEtting him come in your territory would have been worse.]
;B[ki];W[lh];B[li]C[LF - Black is playing useless moves, connecting two living groups together.]
;W[jg];B[ii]C[LF - WHite and black avoid the big point at S18 (or E12). Your moves are almost dame points.]
;W[ih];B[hj];W[kh];B[eh]
(;W[gg]C[LF 6 This is unnecessary.];B[cg]C[LF - Here white must let go the stones or he's dead.]

(;W[df]C[LF - White is dead, black must not fail here.]
(;B[bf]C[Now the game is beginning to enter into the endgame, and here the many places where I chose to ignore gote defense moves, such as at M18 and B14 come to haunt me.


LF - White can only live in gote. M18 was ok, it wasn't worth taking gote because M18 is gote for black. so ou should never play it until it is very late in the game. B14 was a matter of life or death.]
;W[be];B[ag]
(;W[ab];B[da];W[ae]C[LF white is dead here, see variation. White must play C16.]

;B[nd];W[of];B[pe];W[ba];B[ea];W[cd]C[I think that this move was necessary to protect the corner, because a play at C16 would have put the D14 group into atari, allowing my opponent to eliminate eyespace.

LF - Yes, you were lucky.]
(;B[oq];W[nr];B[or];W[os];B[qr];W[qs];B[pq];W[ps];B[qo]C[LF - I prefer S5 here]

(;B[ke];W[le]C[My opponent's continuing sente really pushed me around here

LF - You must keep calm, this move, for example, might be sente, but it doesn't really get points ( it prevents pushing at N13, see variation).]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[ap];W[af]C[I decided to gamble and to see if I could grab sente back, but I think that I made a mistake by not protecting at A3, seeing as that cost me the two stones at B4.

Better keep lost opportunities like this as ko threats... or use them as such earlier.]

Thanks again for any comments!

LF - Having a close game is ok, after all, you just need one more point to win. But yes, there were opportunities, and no, it's not just black + 2,5 as black can enter the bottom right. Also you said that you had seen t, so you can be ok :)he snapback, if so ,then you should play S1.
Anyways, that's quite a good game and you do have good ideas. Maybe you need to care a little more for your groups ? 

Let me know if you need more information.])
