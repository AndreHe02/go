C[Dear reviewer,

I play black in this game. I won, but i'm not happy with some moves I
played. What can be say about them?

Thanks for the help!

Nicolas.];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[cn];W[cl];B[cq]LB[en:A]
C[I would be
more inclined to come out at A instead of this move.
White wants you to come into the corner here.  But this is not bad
either.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[bn]C[White 14 is a bit of a funny shape.  Simply
connecting at C5 would be better.];B[fq];W[fp]C[This is a bad move for
white.  Black is strengthened and gains territory at the bottom, while
white doesn't get anything big at the top.  At least white should play the
knight's move instead of directly pushing.];B[gq]C[Black is correct to
answer simply.  Black gains from this exchange.];W[eq]C[White makes another
bad exchange; white loses a liberty and gains nothing.];B[er]
C[White keeps
going anyway!];W[gp];B[hq]C[Each move here is profitable for black.]
;W[hp];B[qn]LB[ip:A][iq:B]C[Tenuki
seems like a bad idea; black should read out whether the hane works (what
happens if white cuts?) and then play at either A or B.  White's next move
at B will hurt black.];W[pn]LB[iq:B][hr:C]C[White should probably play at B
right away.  If black ignores that, then C is a huge sente play on the
lower side.];B[pm];W[qo]C[Attach and block looks like a bad
choice of joseki for white, since white will get gote and the lower side is
small.  Black will get a big right side while white gains just a
corner.];B[on];W[po];B[qm];W[iq]C[Here white punishes black for the earlier mistake.  Black should
have played here instead of approaching on the
side.];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[jq];B[pj]LB[qg:A]C[This move is too close to your
strength.  Move farther away from those solid stones, perhaps at
A.];W[om];B[nn]TR[pj]LB[mm:B]C[It's a good idea to fight; then the stone
that was too close might still be useful.  If that stone was farther away,
the strategy would be to sacrifice when white cuts.

If you were really concerned about the lower side, which maybe you should
be with all that outward white strength ... then you might have tried
playing the marked stone at B earlier to protect the
cut.];W[ol];B[nq]LB[ml:A]C[This looks like an overplay.  You're not going
to get eyes on the lower side, and white's not going to die in the corner.
Run the other way, toward A, to attack the weak white stones.  This move
looks like an overplay.  If white plays at A next, it will be very hard to
make life for your stones.

This is an absolutely crucial move; the next several dozen moves look bad
for you because you missed the play at A.  Your move (diving into white's
strength) is the wrong direction; attack white's weakness!]
;W[qk]C[White goes the wrong direction here.  White should attack your weak
stones!];B[pq];W[qq];B[op];W[pr];B[oq]TR[iq]LB[ip:A]C[Perhaps you should fight the
ko here.  Your stones look heavy now.  Where are their eyes?  It feels like
a weak black group swimming in a sea of white.

The key mistake was playing away in a pushing battle.  Black had to play at
the marked stone or at A originally.

Now black is a move behind in two fights, on the right side and the lower
side.];W[qj];B[qi]C[Giving up the three stones on the right is a
pretty big loss.  And your lower side stones are still weak.  You haven't
gained any compensation for these losses.];W[ri];B[ro]C[These three stones
are dead; adding another stone to a dead group is not such a good idea.]
;W[rp];B[rh]LB[qh:A]C[This is a little thin; are you still trying to save the dead
stones?  Extending at A would make much stronger
shape.];W[pi];B[qh];W[pk]TR[pi]C[This is probably the wrong
direction for white, because it hurts the important stone (marked).  On
the other hand, taking away the aji of the black stones on the side is
pretty large, and black's stones at the bottom are still weak.  White has a
big lead at this point, and all white's outward-facing strength should
increase the margin as well.];B[oj];W[ml]TR[pi]C[This is an excellent move
for white.  Black's stones below and above are in trouble now, and white
aims at saving the marked stone.];B[lq];W[ln]LB[or:A][qr:B]
[mr:C]C[This move is good for white,
hurting black's shape.  It also aims at making territory to the left.  A
black move at A next might be sente, though, so I might consider playing
there first if I was white.  Black moves at A (forcing B) followed by C
make an almost living group, so it is an important point for both
sides.];B[lo];W[ko]TR[iq]MA[om]C[As white encloses, black may die.  Even if black lives, white
gets a lot of territory in the center.  This game looks very bad for black.

The key mistakes up to this point: letting white play the triangled stone,
and choosing to fight when white cut with the X'd
stone.];B[mo];W[kp]LB[or:A][oh:B]C[This is a small move for white.  It doesn't
destroy black's shape and it doesn't take much more territory in the
center.  I would play at A, worth a few points on the side and very bad for
black's eye shape, or I would play at B to start the next
fight.];B[oo];W[qp];B[mj]TR[pi]C[This is an excellent move
for black, though it might be a bit embarassing if white could kill the
bottom group.  But this point makes the upper side big for black and makes
it hard for white to move out with the marked stone.  Here I start to sense
how you might have ended up winning this game after the painful
opening.];W[kk]TR[pi]LB[nc:A]C[This is very slow for white.  "Don't use thickness
to surround territory" is a good proverb.  White needs to use the strength
to attack, which is why moving out with the marked stone was so important.
But now it's too late.  Still instead of this move white should play at A,
perhaps.];B[ec]C[This takes away another place for white to start a
fight, so it is another very strong move.  White needs to use the strong
outward stones to attack, and now there aren't many places to do
that.];W[nc]TR[pi]C[This is a good move for white if he is aiming at moving
out with the marked stone later.  Black needs to be concerned about that
cut!];B[jd]LB[nd:A]C[Pincering is definitely a good idea.  Attaching on top might
be even better.  The top side is uninteresting to white since black is
already low there, and attaching on top will prevent white from using the
cutting stone.];W[ne];B[pb]C[This is a fine move too, taking territory and taking away
white's eye space in the corner.  However white now has several weak points
to aim at.  Still, black is far enough behind that this risk is probably
appropriate.];W[pf]LB[li:A][ni:B]C[This seems a little deep into black's area.  Perhaps
white could play at A or B instead.];B[qf];W[pe]C[White makes
things too easy for black here; black can easily connect and now there is
no more weak point.  Black is gaining!];B[qe];W[od];B[qd]LB[pc:A]
C[This should
probably be at A.];W[ph]C[Now white has achieved the aim of pulling out the cutting
stone, but the white group here is weak too, so black shouldn't feel too
bad about this fight: black got territory on the side, and now has a
reasonably fair fight to look forward to.];B[ng]C[THis looks like a good
shape point for both black and white; a pretty move for black.]
;W[pg]C[White answers solidly, hoping for a big attack.];B[di]
LB[kf:A]C[This move
is very bad.  It ignores the important fight on e right side!  White plays
around A and the game is over.];W[fk]LB[hj:A]C[Instead, white simply
defends territory.  Now white is committed to enclosing this area in the
center, so you get a lot of free sente moves here.   And even though white
surrounds about 40 points, all the black sente moves around A will gain
quite a few points for black too.  So this move is white's big mistake.  In
fact, black made a bad move but then white's answer here is even worse.
Black gained from this exchange.];B[lc]TR[fk]C[Now we're talking: attack
white, take territory on the top, and escape with your weak stones, and you
have a good game going.

White doesn't have much room for eyes and it's not so easy to get out.
White's marked stone may turn out to be the losing
move.];W[mf];B[kg]C[White is sure in trouble
now!];W[lg];B[kh];W[kf];B[jf];W[lh];B[li]C[Black is going to escape one way or another, so this looks
good for you.];W[jg];B[ki]C[good move, saving the important
stones.];W[je];B[if];W[ke];B[ie]LB[id:A]C[This move might work better at A, taking
the territory on the upper side while white runs
out.];W[kd];B[jc]C[A fine safe move.  Blocking and letting white
atari might get ugly fast.];W[kc];B[mb]C[This looks like funny shape.  Choose one side or the other;
don't try to save everything.];W[kb];B[nb]C[OK, you chose this side; that
looks consistent.];W[mc];B[lb];W[ld];B[jb]LB[ij:A]TR[jg]C[Now you're trying to take both
sides.  If white is already alive here, then this move is not so big.  A
move like A, which makes it harder for the marked stone to escape and
threatens to reduce white, is much bigger.

If you think white might still die, then this is a fine
move.];W[ja];B[ia];W[ka];B[hb]LB[ij:A]C[Black gets gote here, which is why a move like A would have
been bigger.];W[fi];B[ii]C[Now you find it;
good!];W[ik];B[fh]C[That looks like an overplay.  Cap white one line
farther away, perhaps.];W[gh];B[fg];W[ei];B[dh];W[dj]LB[hi:A]
C[White's shape is too weak; white should have played around A
instead.];B[hj]C[A nice way to take advantage of white's
weakness.];W[hk];B[gi]C[Do you see how many points black has gained as
white concentrates on preserving the territory below?  This is the major
flaw in white's strategy in this game.];W[gj];B[hi];W[cj]C[A big move, but
gote.  Still might be worth playing at this point.];B[rr]C[Ouch.  White is
going to have to work to make eyes.  But since black's stones above are
going to die ... hm, or are you going to try to make it a capturing
race?];W[qr];B[or];W[rn]TR[or]C[White wisely plays it safe.  Black gained a little bit by
playing the marked stone in sente, but black would have done better by just
playing this move and not wasting a stone in the corner
first.];B[bh]C[Another big endgame
point.];W[eh];B[eg];W[bi];B[ch];W[ah];B[ag];W[ai];B[bg];W[lp]
;B[mp];W[ms];B[mr];W[qg]C[Usually white should save this kind of move
till the late endgame for a ko threat.

Why didn't white continue on the lower side?  It's better not to
have moved at all than to make that exchange and leave it.

Looks like the rest from here is a normal
endgame.];B[rg];W[rj];B[mm];W[lm];B[ls];W[ks];B[ns];W[sh];B[sf]
