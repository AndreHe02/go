C[Hello, I'm Kevco and playing white without a komi.

 I really felt I played well this game, which is why I am sending it in. I don't know where my mistakes or questions are. If you find something wrong you will help me see where I was blind before. ;-)

Thank you,

Kevin

Goran:

Hi!

It is a custom of GTL to send in the games you have lost and not games you have won. The rationale being you have more to learn from the games you have lost. But seeing the score was quite close (0.5 - rather then what the game info said) I guess it's ok.

Hope you find the review interesting...];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]
;B[jp];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md]LB[ic:A][jd:B]C[Is one connection or another better here?

--------------
Goran:

A matter of preference. Hanging connection lets you extend to A while the other lets you play B. With hoshi I would prefer to get B.]
;B[qf];W[jc]MA[nd][jd]C[Perhaps playing O16 first and then K16 would be better?

--------------
Goran:

Yes. With the hanging connection you should move at j17.];B[fq]
;W[qn]LB[dn:A]C[--------------
Goran:

It's understandable you wish to play here but go is about balance. Playing tenuki means d4 will suffer later. You could play A first.]
;B[ql];W[on]LB[qq:A][qf:B]C[--------------
Goran:

I'd rather take the corner with A. Jumping out here will let black take the bottom side and probably the right. His stone at B is helping him with this fight.]
;B[np]
(;W[rp]C[--------------
Goran:

Not in joseki books. Without this exchange there is aji in the corner. Enough for a small life! And now it is gone.

See variation.];B[qq];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[pm]LB[rp:A][qq:B]C[--------------
Goran:

Again the effects of a bad move are showing up. Consider the variation  at move 18. With the A-B exchange you settled the situation in the corner but then had to come back and fix your shape with 28. Black gained while you lost.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[lp]LB[ol:A][mo:B]C[Too early? Is there a better play? D10?

--------------
Goran:

Do you think your group around A is safe?
Do you think you can gain more points here then you will lose while black attacks your group?
What if black simply plays B and splits your forces appart?]
;B[lo]C[--------------
Goran:

A mistake.];W[ko];B[kp];W[mo];B[mp];W[ln];B[lq]C[--------------
Goran:

Black let you off with an overplay.];W[nh];B[ng];W[pg];B[qh]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[mh];B[pf]C[--------------
Goran:

Another error.];W[nf];B[of];W[ne];B[lf]C[--------------
Goran:

And another error. With three bad moves black has let you get back into the game. On the bottom he took territory and let you build thickness. Around n14 he let himself be cut. And now he is running with a VERY weak group.

This group has no meaning, it cuts two living groups so it does not serve an attack. It is small so it can be sacrificed. If you get anything from this review it should be that m14 is a very bad move.]

;W[nn];B[lo];W[kn];B[mn];W[mm];B[cn]C[My next play worked out fine for me, but I really was at a loss as to which direction to choose. How do I evaluate this corner?

--------------
Goran:

You tenukied so you must be ready to give here. You can live in the corner if the situation calls for it (in such cases however black will be jumping at 3,3). Usually you try to go for the outside and let the corner go.]
;W[fp]LB[hq:A]C[This worked out fine for me, but I really was at a loss as to which direction to choose. How do I evaluate

--------------
Goran:

This is a good direction. Contact plays make you and your opponent stronger. But you are weak here so thats ok for you. Your opponent is very strong here so making him even stronger is not a problem. Actually this will make him overconcentrated.

The rule of thumb in such situation is play toward your opponents stronger stone. You had no chance invading at A. This was practicly his territory. So if you force him to take it while you make your group stronger you have lost nothing and gained some strenght.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go]LB[ep:A][do:B][gq:C]C[--------------
Goran:

I hope you planed on answering black A with B.  In this situation I would consider playing C. Depending on the way black answers this move you may be able to play A in sente or hane at the head of 73.]
;W[dn]C[--------------
Goran:

This is a move you wish to avoid at all costs. This is not attacking black but making his lone stone stronger.]
;B[co];W[dm];B[cm];W[cl];B[bl];W[gn];B[ck];W[ek]LB[do:A][dl:B]
[fn:C][lf:D]C[--------------
Goran:

I must say these moves confused me. You leave a weakness at A you do not defend at B and you create another weakness at C. You are loosing points here. It makes up up for black D so black is now ahead.]
;B[dl];W[el];B[hq]LB[hn:A][cf:B]C[--------------
Goran:

No need. Should be at A then B.];W[hn]C[--------------
Goran:

Good.];B[do];W[ep];B[df];W[eg]C[--------------
Goran:

Interesting. A nice move.];B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[fj];B[eh];W[gh]
;B[fg]C[--------------
Goran:

Slow.];W[ce];B[ef]C[--------------
Goran:

You could say black spent the last 6 moves taking a single white stone. This puts white ahead again.]
;W[bg]C[maybe f16 here first?

--------------
Goran:

Yes. f16 much bigger.];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[hd]C[--------------
Goran:

Lets count.
Black: (ur)30 + (b)30 + (l)10 = 70.
White: (c)55 + (ul)15

So the game is quite close.];W[ge];B[if];W[je]LB[jg:A][hg:B]
C[--------------
Goran:

Should be at A. Black can now play B.]

Goran:

Your opponent made bigger errors in the endgame. At this point you are loosing the game yet at the end you win by 0.5.]

A is double sente so you should play it now.];B[rr];W[sr];B[qr]
