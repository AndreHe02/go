C[Thank you for taking time to review my game. In this game, I play as Black. I will comment on particular spots of question and hope that you will comment on my moves and make recommendations throughout.

Thank you for your time and I appreciate your teachings.

RazorBrain >>> Hi, I'll try to answer your questions and throw in a few miscellaneous comments for you to think about.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[cp];W[pc];B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[Probably should have played at A.

RB>>> Your play or A are both good. No problem here.];W[qe]
;B[of];W[oe];B[pj];W[jd];B[pm]LB[jp:A][cf:B]C[Was this too slow? I'm wondering if I should have played at A or B.

RB>>> Yes this was slow. And yes, either A or B is better. At least you have good hindsight :-) Now you must focus on applying this during your games. Think about why you chose this move under the pressure of the game. what were you worried about that brought you to make this move.  After you identify this play the move for white you were worried about and go through a few variations. It will help you aviod the same mistake in the future.]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[eo];W[dq];B[cq];W[gp];B[jp]C[I wanted to secure as much of the right corner as possible, is there a better move?]
;W[cm];B[cn];W[dm];B[dn];W[gn];B[ho]LB[ec:C][em:B][hq:A]C[This may have been the wrong move, in the end of the game I don't think it mattered too much but I'm wondering if I should have played at A, or do you have a suggestion?

RB>>> I don't think either move is the right one at this point. A solidifies territory and your move peeps. But I think there are bigger moves on the board.  Perhaps B or C. I like B as it separates  the two white groups.]
;W[go];B[mo]C[This move leaves room for a later invasion. While white might not be strong enough to try something like that, it is better not to form habit you have to break later when encountering stronger players. (See variations)]

(;W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[hn];W[dj]
(;B[hl]C[RB>>> I think a pair of hanes would do nicely here. See variation]
;W[gl];B[jh]LB[ec:C][ne:B][gk:A]C[This seems like a stretch, is this too big of a moyo?

RB>>> the gaps are too wide to call this a moyo. It is a nice formation though and should worry white. But likewise white's upper left has good potential. When you compare your bottom right and white's upper left, your corner is stronger. Rather than trying to wrap up a huge piece of territory with this one move I think some turning moves would do more for you. (A and B.) You might also think about jumping into the upper left before white makes it stronger.]
;W[ij];B[jj];W[hk]C[RB>>> With the turning move mentioned several moves ago, white would have had a harder time here.]
;B[il];W[kq];B[jq];W[jr];B[lq];W[lr];B[kp];W[kr];B[ik];W[gj]
;B[mq]C[This felt like an urgent move, my hopes were to close off the enter right corner.]
;W[mf];B[jf]C[I remember wanting to push into white's territory here, I thought that the game would be too close or that I am behind in possible territory.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[gf];B[hg];W[ii];B[ji];W[gg];B[ke]TR[mf]C[Trying to push into whites territory more, hoping to cut off the marked stone.

RB>>> You end up getting two stones, but you let white snake into your territory. Not sure you gained a lot.]

;W[pf];B[og];W[pg];B[ng];W[od]
(;B[lg]C[This geta (net) is not necessary. THese white stones aren't going anywhere. Better to have used your move to stop white's thrust.]
;W[pi]C[This move is disturbing and causes me problems. I'm not sure what my response was, let's see.

RB>>> Yes this is a big move for white. He is glad to sacrifice the two stones for this. (See comments of previous move.)]

(;B[qh]LB[oh:A]C[I think I probably should have played at A. Your thoughts?

RB>> I like a more direct cut. I think A here can black into a lot of trouble. (See variations.)]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[lf];W[ni]C[RB>>> B or C is better at this point.]

(;B[qg]LB[nj:A]C[This move seems wrong, maybe better at A?

RB>>> I think A is too close. Contact is not the way to stop an incursion like this. You need to place a little looser. You'll have to give up a bit more int he short term, but in the long run it will work out better. See Variation.]
;W[mi];B[li];W[mk]C[RB>>> Now white is off an rund running again in the middle. A looser net could have prevented this.]

;W[fd];B[gd];W[ed];B[gh]LB[dc:A]C[I was trying to capture the marked stones, I didn't feel good about the stones in the left corner, I thought they might die. Is there a better move? Possibly at A?]

(;B[hh]C[RB>>> This play was wasted. It would have been good to use it instead to turn white and limit further damage inthe middle. You had no possibility of a cut here. If if you did 6-8 points isn;t worth passing up a chanse to stop white.]

(;B[mm]LB[os:A]C[Now this move seems wrong, is it possible to kill the lower right corner? Should I have played at A?

RB>>> THis is move ir right! And no, white's corner is safe unless he blunders. (See variation)]

RB>>> Ooops! White didn't see that one.];B[rp];W[rq];B[sp];W[mr]

(;B[hj]C[I estimated the score and it felt like I need to secure a few more points or else it would be too close so I played the snapback.

RB>>> Okay but continuing to push into the corner whould have yielded as much. Either one is fine.]
;W[sq];B[fn];W[dk];B[bm];W[el];B[oi]C[I felt like I had to force the KO battle back to me.]
;W[oh];B[dl]C[So I got it back.];W[bl];B[di]C[I don't remember what I was thinking here, it certainly seems like a wasted move.]
;W[ci];B[an]C[Wanted to secure the lower left corner.];W[al]
;B[ef]LB[ce:A]TR[ge][fe][gd][gc][fc]C[This turned out to be a fantastic move. I was hoping that white wouldn't notice the weakness (marked as A) plus I felt like I might make use of the marked stones to try to get more territory in the corner. Was this a bad idea in most cases or a fine thing to try?

RB>>> Never hurts to try! :-) But I wouldn't have expected it to work!!! What was white afraid of. SHould have played C14.]

(;W[dh]C[I got lucky, he didn't notice! Attack!];B[ce];W[cf]

;W[de];B[cg]C[I thought if he filled I could capture even more.]
;W[bg];B[ce]C[I didn't think I could push it anymore so I capped his stones.]
;W[bf]C[RB>>> Obviously, this was the game for white. Until the blunder at D12, he had a lead.]

;B[kk];W[pe];B[km]C[and cap the end off for security.];W[rf]

Result: B+2.5


It was close, I won, my prize was a very good lesson in middle game fighting.

RB>>> Yes this was a fun one to win. It could have gone the other way. This type of game makes you glad your opponent isn't perfect, eh. I played one of these games today :-) Luckily my opponent had a few weaknesses to match my own :-)

RB>>> It's good that you took the time to work through  your variations!!! This will make you strong much faster than just playing game after unreviewed game! ALso try working life and death  problems. Lots of them. Work them daily if possible. Work some easy ones. Ones that you can solve almost instantly. They may seem too easy, but they will build instinct. Also try some harder ones eah day. Should tak eno more than 2-3 minutes to solve. THis will build reading ability. Both will help you a lot. Good luck!!! Keep playing and reviewing!
