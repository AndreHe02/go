AB[pd][dp][dd][pp];W[qf];B[qe]C[RM: This play is normaly only made when black has support at
K16 or K17.];W[pf];B[nc];W[qc]C[is it right move?
I use to think that my tokens in corner protect it well enough
- as you see later I lost all corners because I was overconfident
about strength of my tokens

RM: This area should be left for later. White should make Q14
alive. R10 would be the normal move for white. Attacking the
corners, from the inside should not be done early in the game
as it helps the defender to become strong on the outside.];B[pc]
C[RM: Wrong. Black must separate whites groups - this is an important
concept when attacking.
S15 seems simple and good.];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[pa];W[re];B[rd]
C[definitevely bad move - isnt it?
RM: Yes. Played elsewhere would be the right idea here. This
region is not urgent.];W[qd];B[pe];W[sd]C[RM: Should be at S13.]
;B[qb]C[RM: The worst move. This sort of thing is just a bad habit. Although
it looks like a harmless sente move, it is not. Later in the
game there may be a ko fight. It is really important not to waste
ko threats like R18.

RM: Important! Worse still this move removes the possibility
of black S14. In summary the "dead" black stone at S16 is very
valuable. It has a lot of "aji" (it causes potential problems)
whilst it is on the board. Once the stone is removed black can
never threaten this group. With the stone in place the prospect
of black playing S14 will worry white. Black may choose never
to actualy play S14, but might approach around R12, forcing white
to defend. There are many possibilities - but all are lost once
S16 is removed.];W[rc];B[of];W[pj];B[qn];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[fc]
C[RM: Not a bad move, but I think black should pincer at k3 or
similar. That way gaining terratory (between K3 group that will
form and D4) whilst attacking. Note however that black's lower
corner is not safe.];W[jd];B[ld];W[cf];B[ce]C[RM: The same bad shape. This shape does very little without support.
It does not take the corner, it does not make an effecient moyo.
It is not alive.];W[df];B[ff]C[what do you make of that move
I played it also in lower corners and it seems it worked well

RM: Yes this is a sensible move. You are separating white's groups.
Also you are making a large potential terratory at the top.]
;W[dj];B[cn]C[RM: There is no need to defend the corner stones like this. If
the corner stone is attacked more closely, then a resonce may
be required. Consider pincering at k4 for example.];W[fq];B[eq]
C[RM: Argh ;-)];W[fp];B[eh];W[dh];B[ej];W[eg];B[fg];W[ei];B[fi]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[eh];B[fj];W[jp]
(;B[fn]C[RM: This move seems meaningless. Black needs to make the most
of the upper region I believe. How about P13?];W[cl];B[dl];W[dk]
;B[el];W[ql];B[nn]C[RM: Again this move seems motiveless.];W[oo]
;B[jn];W[lp];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq];B[jo];W[ko];B[ln];W[ph]
C[RM: This move is not urgent. White should play K14 to erase the
large upper terratory.]
(;B[jf]C[RM: Good idea, but this leaves a weakness at L15. This capping
type move is often good, but the small knight's move L14 is often
more suitable when chasing a group/stone.];W[hd];B[hc];W[if]
;B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[gf];B[hg];W[je];B[ig];W[ic]
(;B[ge]C[RM: No need to play here. White could not play G13 anyway, so
cannot attack the two black stones. H18 will stengthen black
whilst stopping white living at the edge.];W[gd];B[fe];W[hb]
;B[gc];W[kc]C[it's bad to
reduces my possibilities and is gote];B[fd];W[id]
(;B[kf]C[RM: No need to defend this stone, M17 is the crucial place.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[gb];B[fb];W[mb]
(;B[oh]C[how should I stop white
this sequence that starts right here
it's my repeating error in many many games
I let enemy crawl but rarely happen to use it up as a chance
to consolidate my territory

RM: I see. Your attachment at P12 is a defence move. You should
not typically use this type of move to attack, or secure terratory.

Try playing further away from your opponent, so that as he tries
to attack you, you become stronger instead.

For example N11 or O12 or N10.];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[mi];W[mj]
;B[li];W[lj];B[kj];W[ll];B[kl];W[qq]C[RM: Black's weakness is clear. White cannot fail here.]

(;B[on]C[RM: Trying to connect out the weak group in the corner is not
the best option here. Q2 and Q3 look interesting.];W[cq]C[once again I'm loosing corner - is there a way I could avoid
it?

RM: Not after C3. You have accepted the invasion by making this
shape in the first place. Remember that the idea of the 4/4 opening
is to welcome white to take the corner and end up surrounding
them, giving influence to the sides and center. The 4/4 opening
is NOT about keeping the corner!

RM: Note that if black plays E2 before white invades, he might
be able to secure the corner and still keep sente. See the endgame
sequence variation (move 108, Q3 variation).];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo]

the move I made would have endangered all my tokens i lower right

(and to avoid!). Actualy I think black is alive in the corner
anyway. Please see the varaition beggining b L6...]

short of liberties to attack.]
(;W[rn];B[so];W[bn];B[ap];W[bs]C[RM: At this point the game is even. Black should look for sente
moves, failing that the biggest gote move. Remember one point
in sente is usualy better than 10 points in gote.]

RM: Yes you were winning for most of the game. Note what a big
difference the engame moves make. The score changed by 14 points
(see variation from move 194), that equivalent to a BIG GROUP
(same as white's left hand group)! It demonstrates that the endgame
is very important.])
