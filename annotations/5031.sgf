C[please review for both sides];B[qd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[cc]C[an experiment, not knowing the joseki

CG: Well, this is an overplay - white has the first move in a symetrical position and should get an advantage. The normal move would be E17, which could lead to the avalanche (nadare) joseki.]
;W[ec];B[cf];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[bf];W[be];B[ae];W[bd];B[fd]
LB[df:A]TR[cb][cc]C[is this ok?

CG: This tries to make use of the marked stones, but the problem is the cut at A. This is ok if  you can handle the ensuing fight.]
;W[df];B[ch];W[ef]LB[ed:A][fe:C][dg:B]TR[fd]C[CG: This is a bad move. White has several possibilities - capturing the marked stone with A, attacking the left side (and threatening a ladder) with B, forcing with C - the cutting stone has a lot of aji which is a burden for black.
By moving out immediately, white eliminates these possibilities and burdens himself with a heavy group. 
This does not necessarily lead to a bad result, but usually it's better to play elsewhere first and use the aji later - when the position is such that one can decide which of the possible continuations is the best.]
;B[fe];W[eh];B[di];W[ei]C[CG: Now white is pushing from behind. Black gets territory on the side while white just settles his group.]
;B[fc]C[CG: Not really sente - white could continue on the left side.]
;W[fb]C[CG: This is a bad move as black can block with sente.]
;B[gb];W[db];B[fa];W[eb]LB[ej:A]C[as black, where would you play now?

CG: First of all, the white move is bad (too small and gote).
Now A is an urgent move for both sides.];B[od]C[CG: Big, but not really urgent.]
;W[hc]TR[df][ef][eh][ei]C[comment?

CG: If the marked white stones were strong, this would be a nice attacking move. But here it looks like an overplay.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[gf];W[kc]
(;B[mc]C[CG: This is the wrong direction.];W[if]C[CG: Good!]
;B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[fj]C[CG: Good! Now black has two weak groups.]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[hj];W[dk];B[ck];W[cl];B[dj];W[ek];B[bk];W[bl]
;B[bi]C[just drawing back would be safe, but black had ideas of cutting something.  comment?

CG: I don't see how this move helps black to "cut something"?
Black barely lives on the left side where he could have made territory while attacking white if he had play 33 at E10.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[hk];B[ij];W[jl];B[ik];W[il];B[fl];W[fk];B[hm]
C[CG: This is a vulgar aji-keshi. At some point (with reduced liberties or after F6) H8 might work.]
;W[hl];B[fn];W[cp];B[cq];W[do];B[ep];W[bp];B[bq];W[jq];B[hq]
;W[jo];B[jd]C[too early?

CG: This move is very similar to white H17 - you should not attack with weak groups.]
;W[jc];B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[jg];B[le];W[kg];B[ih];W[ig];B[ki]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[fi];B[gi];W[li];B[lj];W[lh];B[kk];W[ji];B[jk]
C[CG: This is a strange move - white can't cut anyway, so why not O10? If black wants to attack the white group, J11 would be better.]
;W[ii];B[kl];W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[kn];W[jm];B[jn]C[CG: Again, I don't get the purpose of this move. Black still has to settle his large group, so it's not the right time to start another fight here.]
;W[in];B[ko];W[kp];B[lo]
(;W[io]C[CG: This lacks fighting spirit. J6 is affordable, M6 is an important cutting stone.]
;B[mn];W[go];B[en];W[mp]LB[ml:A][qo:B]TR[lm][jn][kn][mn][ko]
[lo]C[A obviously needs defending, but if A then B black would lose his territory advantage.  what do you advise?

CG: What about a move like Q10? Why should black defend around A? The marked stones are not very important as white is already alive.]

(;B[mo]C[CG: This move helps white to make territory.];W[np]
;B[qq]C[CG: "When fighting starts, forget about territory" - this invasion is too early. By playing on the right side (e.g. Q11), you can make territory while threatening the white group.]
