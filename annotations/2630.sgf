C[Hi !
I'm glad to review your game.
You played well, but I think you overestimated your territory or underestimated white's. 
You were ambitious at the beginning and then you stopped attacking white. Neither did you try to enlarge your territory.

I have shown you some moves to reduce your opponent's territory.

I have categorized my comments under the following topics :
-shape,
-tactics,
-whole board thinking,
-direction of play.

I hope they will be useful. I think you played well enougth that you can understand them.

Have a good review :))];B[pp]C[Traditionally, the first move is played in the upper right corner for politeness reasons :)]
;W[dc];B[dp];W[qd];B[de];W[fd]LB[cc:A]C[Tactical:
White's answer to your approach move leaves opened the attachment at A which is a big point because it removes the corner form white.
[var\]]
(;B[dh]LB[cc:A]C[If you play here, you should not forget that A is a big move later.]
;W[qn];B[on]LB[nq:A][np:B][ql:C]C[Tactical:
Normal is to answer at A or B or pincer at C.
This shape has a weakness around A.];W[pl];B[pi]C[Shape :
Invasions should be played on the third line.
The fourth line doesn't give a base of life.];W[qj];B[pf];W[oe]
;B[of]LB[of:A][ne:B][ni:C]C[Tactical :
A-B exchange is called "pushing from behind". This kind of play usually helps your opponent and thus should be avoided.
Here it helps build the table shape (with C) which is good shape when under attacked.
You can also jump a C directly because your two stones are attacked from both sides and they may need to run.]
;W[ld]LB[ne:A]C[Tactical :
Should be at A.
One should try to keep ahead of one's opponent's stones.];B[id]
;W[ie];B[he];W[jd];B[if];W[jf]LB[je:A]MA[hd][hf]C[Shape:
This is bad from white. white gives black a ponnuki which is a very strong shape.
Simply connecting at A would create two cutting points (X).]
;B[je]CR[id][he][if]C[Shape :
"the ponnuki is worth 30 points"];W[ke];B[ie];W[kg]
(;B[jg]C[[var\]];W[kf];B[jh]LB[jg:A][jh:B][ni:C]CR[of][pf][pi]
C[Whole board analysis :
While locally good, the A-B combination hurts the marked stones.
You are helping white to surround them which is dangerous since those stones don't have a base of life yet.
They are under heavy pressure now. C, which completes the table shape, is vital.
Imagine a white stone there :)];W[fq]LB[ni:C]C[White should attack at C]
;B[fp];W[gp]LB[fo:A][eq:B]C[Shape:
There are two better moves for black after this attachement : A or B.]

(;B[ep]LB[dr:A]C[Shape :
This move is not efficient. 
The three stones do not protect anything.
White can still slide at A to take the corner and the left side remains open to an invasion.
The other variations prevent that.
[var\]];W[jp];B[lp]LB[np:B][lq:A]TR[pp]C[Shape:
Up to now, very few stones have been played on the 3rd line.
It is however an essential line to secure a base of life.
Thus, if you want to attack the three white stones, you should remove their base.
White can answer your move by attaching at A which give him a base, therefore a better move was A. Moreover, A makes it easier to make territory with your lower right corner.
The relation with the marked stone is also stronger.]
(;W[kq]C[White is a really nice guy :)
[var\]];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[ls];B[ms]LB[cc:A][ni:B][dm:C]C[Strategy :
You should keep this kind of forcing moves for the endgame.
The reasons are :
 - there are bigger moves to  play right now (A,B,C for instance)
 - you an use them as ko threats];W[jr];B[dm]TR[dp][ep][fp]
C[Shape: 
A good point. Makes the three stones stonger and more useful]
;W[ff]LB[cc:A]C[Tactical :
I think A is still big.
[var\]]
(;B[gh];W[cd]C[Too late for A now];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[ee];B[dd]
;W[ed];B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[fg];B[fh]LB[go:A]C[Full board analysis :
After this very good defense, a black move at A becomes huge !]
;W[gg]LB[go:A][fm:B]C[Direction :
This part of the board is not important anymore. White should attack the black moyo at A or B.]
;B[hg];W[nf]LB[ni:A]TR[jh][on][lp]C[Direction :
At last your weak stones come under attack, but from the wrong direction. A was a better move being the vital point of the table shape. Moreover it pushes black against white's strong group. Instead white is attacking from a strong group.]
;B[ng]C[Direction :
You should rather try to escape to the center with a move like A. You will have a lot of help from the black stones in the center and on the lower side.]
;W[qf]TR[qj][pl][qn]LB[qg:A]C[Direction :
You should try to keep these stones weak (triangles).
A play at A would keep them separated.];B[pe];W[od];B[pd];W[pc]
;B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[qh]LB[rg:A]C[A was correct];B[qg];W[rg]
;B[rf];W[sg];B[sf]LB[ph:A]C[Startegy :
Endgame move again. 
A is more important ! The two white groups are already alive so you need not keep them separated. White can sacrifice his two stones and shut your group in which would not be useful anymore.
[var\]]
(;W[ri]C[So the white group lives now.];B[ph]C[the only move.]
;W[qi]SQ[be][ce][de][df][eg][fh][gh][hg][if][jg][jh][dp][ep]
[fp][go][hn][im][jl][jk][jj][ji][cq][cr][cs][ae]LB[go:B][oh:C]
[ib:D]C[Full board analysis:
There is potential for a lot of territory on the right side + center (squares), therefore you should play a point like B.

B is the vital point for your moyo. It prevents white from anihilating the territory in the center. B would be my choice. It is critical.

(You need not worry about your group of stones in upper right, it can evade a white attack and connect either to the left or to the bottom right. Moreover, you only need one move at C to make two eyes so this group is alive as it stands.)

If you make an appreciation of the balance of territory now, white has the whole upper side (with the two corners), while you have only the left side minus one corner.
Your territorry in the lower right corner is roughly equal to white's territory on the right side + bottom.

So white is a bit ahead (he has one more corner than black) and you must either enlarge your territory into the center (B) or reduce white's territory at the top (D)]
;B[ol]LB[go:A]C[Full board:
A was better.];W[ok];B[om]LB[pm:A]C[Shape:
A is better.];W[lo];B[mo];W[ko];B[mn]LB[go:A]C[Full board :
A still better :)];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[po]LB[rq:A]C[Tactical:
A is normal.
White can take the corner now.
[var\]]
(;W[qo]C[White is too submissive.];B[rq];W[fo]C[Full board :
So white starts reducing black's potential in the center. Hopes for a large center territory are disappearing. 
Unless you reduce him later at the top white will stay ahead.]
;B[eo]TR[fo]MA[do]LB[fm:A][go:B]C[Shape:
Useless move.
This stone protects one point of territory (cross), that's inefficient. You should play away from your strong stones.
I would recommend A instead.
Depending on your mood, you can also cut and fight with B];W[fn]
;B[en]LB[eo:A][fn:B][en:C][fm:D][fl:E]C[Shape:
Again, bad defense. You are "pushing from behind" (A-B, C-D exchanges) which is only helping white to make a very strong wall.
This wall will prevent you from building a very large territory and solidifies white's position at the bottom. All hopes for a big center territory are now gone.
E was better.];W[fm];B[ek]C[Shape:
At last, this is correct defense.
however, it seems you didn't see you were able to enlarge your left side by taking points into the center. You were only defending the left side. You need more 3D vision :)
Once you have a moyo, try to make it as big as possible !];W[eq]
LB[dr:A]C[Tactical:
Slide at A is correct];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[ds];B[cs]C[Startegy :
Now it is endgame, so this move is good :))];W[fr];B[hk]SQ[ei]
[ej][fi][fj][gi][gj][hi][hj][ii][ij]LB[go:A][fm:B]C[Also good, but will this be enough ? This is 10 points (squares).
Had this intention come earlier, with a play like A or B, the territory would have been bigger.]

;W[jl];B[jn]LB[lm:A]C[Tactical :
Very dangerous !
You have to be careful and watch the connection at A.];W[jo]
;B[in];W[kk]LB[lm:A]C[Take care, this move threatens to cut at A]
;B[mk]LB[ll:A]C[Too far, A was enough.];W[lj];B[ho];W[go];B[hp]
;W[hq];B[kp]LB[ln:A]C[Still time to connect at A];W[lm]C[too late now :)
White sacrifices a stone...];B[ln];W[kn];B[ll];W[jm]C[... and cuts.]

[nn][nm][mm][ml][nl][lm][qf][pg][og][oh]C[Now you have sente, so it should be time for a full board analysis.

Black : 63 (left) + 28 (lower right) + 4 (right) = 95
White : 28 (bottom) + 18 (right) + 53 (potentially at the top) + 2 prisonners + 6,5 komi = 107,5

So white is leading.
Since you cannot expect to get more territory, you're only chance to win is to reduce white's territory at the top.]

 - cut white,
 - connect black,
