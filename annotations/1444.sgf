C[Hello.  Thank you for reviewing our game.

 I (Ben) am black and Paula is white.  We are both a little under 30th kyu.  T
his game was played on the Dragon Go Server.

Being new to the game, we don't have many specific questions except "how could
 we have captured more teritory?"

Llywelyn:

Hey! Hopefully this review can help you to become stronger players.  I'll admit up-front that I am not that familiar with 13x13 games, but hopefully you'll find my comments to be of some use.  If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to email me at dclement@mines.edu.

Actually, it seems that your main problems are worrying too much about territory: you are both making greedy plays that, while they protect territory in the short run, fail to gain larger amounts of territory in the longer game.]
;B[dj];W[jd];B[dd];W[jj];B[gj];W[gd];B[gg]TR[kf][kh][dg]C[Llywelyn: This move, while not poor, is just a touch small at this stage.  
Remember the proverb: "Corners, then sides, then middle."  I've marked a few m
oves that would probably be better.]DO[];W[fd]CR[gd][jd]SQ[jg]
TR[cf][ch]MA[ec]C[Llywelyn: Very small play--it develops slowly and doesn't build too much of
 a wall or expand your influence.  I've marked a few options...

The X develops well with the circled stones, the triangles are fairly standard
 approach moves and would make good invasions, and the square is a *big* point
 right now and would help fortify the right side.]GB[1]BM[1]
;B[fc]MA[jg][jf][jh]CR[jj]C[Llywelyn: Smallish, an invasion would be better at this point, or attemptin
g to split off the circled stone by playing at the one of the Xs.]
;W[gc]TR[jg][cf][ch][ef][ff][hk]C[Llywelyn: Also small--too defensive, you (both of you) are worrying too much about territory at this stage of the game: sometimes a lot of influence counts for more than a little territory.]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fe]TR[ef][jg]LB[ee:a]C[Llywelyn: Risk.  White playing at "a" right now could cause a lot of damage
, better plays are at the triangles.];W[ge]LB[ff:a]SQ[ee]TR[hf]
[gf]C[Llywelyn: Small. Both triangles develop better and help emphasize your othe
 stones.  Playing on the square would also be highly destructive.]
;B[ii]TR[gg]C[Ben:  Knowing how the game turned out, I think I should have played at E9 h
ere.  I was trying to grab a big piece of territory with this move, at the tim
e.

Llywelyn: Yep :-)  An invasion would also have been good here.  The shoulder hit (your move) is premature.  This also doesn't play well with the marked stone--the one space diagonal jump is weak and it will come back to haunt you later if you are not careful.]
;W[ji];B[ik]C[Llywelyn: The other direction is more important right now ;-)]
;W[jh];B[ig]LB[hh:a]C[Llywelyn: "a" would have been stronger and defended yourself better.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[he];B[gf]LB[ff:A]C[Llywelyn: While your stones on the lower side are weak enough that a white play here (or worse, one over at "a") would be a concern, this move is somewhat awkward if not vulgar.

"a" provides even better protection and reinforces that lone stone.]
;W[ij];B[ih];W[jk]TR[cf][ch][ck][ee][hj]C[Llywelyn: Wrong direction--the other way is more important ;-)  Also, black is ripe for an invasion anywhere along the left side right now--with so many invasion possabilities...  Black 
may be able to jump into your territory, but you are risking only a handful of points compared to what you could take through invasion.  You are behind at this point,
 so taking some risks is probably a good thing.];B[il];W[jl]
C[Llywelyn: Conservative.];B[hj]
(;W[jm]LB[jg:a][fi:b]C[Llywelyn: A strong endgame move, this is only worth about one or two points even then, there are other invasions inside of black's territory that are worth 20 or more points.  See the variation for a possible invasion.

Also, "a" is looking vulnerable--black could take many more points from you there then they can if you do not play this move.]
;B[im];W[ee]C[Ben:  This is the start of Paula's invasion into my territory.  I would l
ike to know how to better handle this kind of situation.  And i am sure Paula 
would like to know how she could have made her invasion more effective.]
;B[df]C[Llywelyn: Good read not trying to save the one stone.]

(;W[ff]C[Llywelyn: This move looks okay on the surface, but in truth it is greedy: small
 and too focused on capturing.  Note that in the variations this stone is never captured--not to say that there aren't times when capturing it is a good idea, only that there are bigger fish to fry.]
;B[eg]LB[fg:a]C[Llywelyn: One closer to your wall, at "a", would have been a stronger play.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gb]LB[fb:A][jg:B]TR[fc][ec]C[Llywelyn: Small and ill-timed.  In general, for a move like this you want to wrap around the other stones at "a"--this will simultaneously attack the marked stones while defending against further incursion.   That being said, a better move from the point of view of attacking and defense would be "b," since it would repair a hole in your wall.]

(;B[fb]TR[db]LB[jg:A]C[Llywelyn: Ack! An empty triangle!  ;-)

The marked move producinges better shape, though at the moment an invasion at "a" would probably be much better (see variation)]
;W[de];B[ce];W[ef];B[dg]
(;W[jg]C[Llywelyn: Good :-)  That being said, I've presented an alternate invasion considering the places of your stones that, had this weakness not been there, would have cinched the game.]
;B[cc];W[ga]LB[fa:a][gh:b]C[Llywelyn: Small on two fronts. First: As an endgame play, it isn't bad 
(sometimes its very useful), but the play at "a" is a bit more traditional and
 gets you one more point (and there is no pressing need to keep sente right now--beyond the move discussed below).

Second: Now that you have set up such a pretty trap at "b" , now is a great time to play it--it is worth about 7 points of their territory whereas this is worth only 2 (the number you would lose if black played here first).]
;B[fa];W[gh]C[Llywelyn: This move won white the game.];B[hi]
TR[gi]C[Llywelyn: Nice read! Falling for trying to save your stones immediately
 would have been a big mistake.  That being said, I think one over (marked) would have worked better with your other stones and left about the same effect.]
;W[hg];B[fi];W[hh];B[gi]C[L];W[gf]LB[gg:a][hf:b][gf:c]SQ[ck]
C[Llywelyn: Overplay.  This move isn't necessary--black can't attack successfully (though I know it looks that way)--the points "a" and "b" are miai with "c":  if black plays a or b, you can play c, and if black plays c, you can play a or b.

If you were behind in points at this stage, you could also still attempt a 3-3
 invasion, but considering that you are ahead and he passed first, taking the 
sure thing was the wiser route.

In Summary:

Both of you:  How to get more territory? Worry less about territory ;-)

Paula: You are focusing too much on building an impenatrable wall and not enough on taking territory.  Don't be afraid to throw something into black's territory, particularly if there is a lot of open space.  You'll get a feel for when you can find life under his stones.  When invading,don't be in a rush to capture if there are better moves. 

Ben: Focus on your shape.  There are six basic hangema--the creep (extension), the diagonal, the 1 space jump, the small knight's move, the 2 space jump.  There are also other shapes to be aware of: bamboo joints, tiger's mouths, and other ways of connecting stones.  Learn these and, by themselves, you will go up in strength.   Finally, watch for bad shape: empty triangles, "crippled horses," one space diagonal jumps, &c.    Practice with them and see how they make sense, and see which ones apply in which circumstances.]

(;B[cd]C[Llywelyn: It may seem better to try and throw in a ladder breaker, but this simply makes the left side ripe for invasion, see the variation for a way it can play out.]
;W[eb]C[Llywelyn: Now black has those two stones caught in a ladder, which is *very* good for white.]

(;B[db]TR[fc][ec]C[Llywelyn: Black should *not* attempt to save the marked stones--it is better at this point to recoup one's losses than continue in a lost cause.  See the variation for what happens if black plays through with the ladder.]
;W[fb];B[cc]C[Llywelyn: This has helped black to fortify the left-hand side and protect it from further incursions.]

(;B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dd];B[db]TR[be][cf][bc][cb]C[Llywelyn: This last stone is a bit questionable as to where it should be played--it might be better to try and protect black's weak wall, though there is too much to hope to defend.  I've labeled some of the bad aji (weaknesses) that white can take advantage of.]
