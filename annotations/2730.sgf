C[Thanks so much for reviewing my game!  My postgame comments will be the ones preceded by [MK\]

[MK\]This was a pretty close game.  I know both of us made mistakes.  I'm guessing that the biggest reason I lost this game was my inability to get a good chunk of the center and/or my opponents' getting the territory in the middle/top.  Please let me know anything you think would help in this regard, or of course anything else you see.  Thanks again!

-- 
Hello,

Not really - I mean it wasn't a close game (although it ended quite close), and "there's no point in the center" as the saying goes...

Anyway, I hope you'll find my comments useful; I included many variations.

-- 
Yann, aka linfir on KGS];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dc]C[[MK\] I must admit that I really have no idea what I'm doing in terms of the opening.  Any comments would be appreciated.

--

So far it seems ok to me.];B[ce];W[fd];B[ch];W[cj]C[[MK\] I was thinking he'd jump out to the middle here, and I could play around D7 to try to map out a bit of territory.  Obviously, that is not what occurred...

-- 

He would need to jump to the center if his stones were weak. Here, they can get an easy life in the corner (B17 or C17) ; and the 'attacking' triangled stone is a bit alone to really attack.]
;B[co]
(;W[gp]TR[cm]C[
-- 

Maybe it's a bit passive, and it would be better to play C7 (see variation).
This way, black would definitely be separated and under heavy pressure.]
;B[cl];W[ej]CR[di][dk]TR[cj]C[
-- 
It is a good idea to jump out because you don't want your stone to get caught, but it is not the right way, because here black can connect (see variation).

It is better to play a kosumi (D11 or D9) to really separate black.]

(;B[mq]
(;W[jq]C[
--
I think it is a bad move. You should use your sente to force black to make his two groups live while taking territory in the corners
(of course, it would be more true if black were really separated...). See variation for an example.]
;B[hc]
(;W[gc]C[
-- 
No. I think you should play C16 instead (see variation), because the exchange G17-H16 doesn't really make you alive, and it helps black a lot.]
;B[hd];W[pj]CR[cl][co]TR[hc][hd]SQ[ce][ch]C[[MK\] Should I have done something different here after he did not extend from standing up? Or was this a good time to grab this spot?

-- 
It is indeed a very big point, but you should look for urgent points first, as the saying goes.
If you wait too long, you will lose the opportunity to attack black. Right now, you could attack either of these three groups.]
;B[lc];W[pm];B[qf]
(;W[qh]CR[oc]TR[qc]SQ[lc][pd][qf]C[-- 
No. Firstly, there is no need to defend ; your two stones are quite safe.
Secondly, where a black hoshi has his two extensions, you should invade at once, usually at the san-san (see variation). 
Here, if blacks adds only one more stone, for example at P17, look at how big a secure territory he has !]
;B[qn]C[
-- 
Black is really overplaying. Both his corners are not safe against invasions, and he has two weak groups (assuming they really are separated). You should play more aggressively and punish him for overplaying, otherwise he'll map much more territory than you do.]
;W[qm]C[
-- 
There is plenty of aji in both black corners. The problem with playing moves like R7 is that you help black getting stronger, hence erasing the aji ; that's not a good idea, especially as your stones are not that weak. If you absolutely wish to defend, better to jump out to the center, keeping the aji for later.]
;B[rn];W[rm]C[
-- 
Same here. It is too slow. You should keep sente and attack.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq]TR[cl][co][ep][cq]SQ[cj][ej]C[
-- 
Now, black's group is very safe. Hence your two stones are getting weaker...]
;W[dp]C[
-- 
You're not doing much with that.
At worst, black can afford to give you that stone.];B[eo];W[do]
;B[dn];W[qc]C[[MK\] Bad idea?

-- 
No, it's a good idea, but maybe a bit late.];B[pc];W[qd]C[-- 
I'm really not sure, but I think white dies here.];B[qe];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[od]C[-- 
I think black doesn't really need this move, that's why white dies (see variation). But it's quite complicated.]
;W[re];B[rf];W[rd]C[-- 
Now white lives.];B[rh]C[-- 
Too small, best left for the yose (endgame).];W[ri];B[qg];W[qi]
;B[cp]TR[sh]C[-- 
Here you should atari at T12 first (it make a one point difference in the yose).]
;W[fp]TR[eo][ep]C[-- 
You threaten to capture two black stones with E6, but there are much bigger points (the top left corner for instance).]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[dd];W[ec];B[kr];W[jr]TR[cj][ej]C[-- 
Let's make a quick summary of the situation:

Almost every group is settled, except maybe for the two white stones, but they can run to the center (at a cost, of course, because black can make some territory at the same time). And there might be some aji in the lower right corner.

For black: about 30 points for the top, 25 for the lower left corner, two times 10 points on the left side. That's about 75 points.

For white: 8 points in the upper right corner, a bit more than 10 in the upper left corner, a bit less than 20 in the lower side, and about 10 in the right side. That's about 50 points.

So, at this point, I'd say black is ahead by about 20 points (including komi).

White can't afford to play too passively.];B[kq];W[jo]C[-- 
Maybe a bit slow.];B[gn];W[fo]
(;B[en]TR[fn]C[-- 
Black could have played F6 (see variation)];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[fk]TR[cj][ej]C[-- 
White is in a tight spot. You can't afford to lose these stones.]
;W[eh]C[-- 
Good shape.];B[eg]TR[ef]C[
-- 
It would be better to play at E14. Contact moves are usually no good for attacking.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[fi]C[-- 
A bit strange.];W[fh];B[ei]
(;W[dh]TR[di]C[-- 
I think you should have played D11 (see variation).]
(;B[di]C[[MK\] Would he have been better off playing F15 here (or earlier)?

--
F15 doesn't work, see variation.];W[ee];B[df]TR[cg]C[-- 
Bad shape. Better to play at C13.];W[bd]TR[ci]C[-- 
That's way too small, this is for yose.
Or maybe you intended to wake the aji of the cut at C11 ? That seems interesting, but I don't see how to make it work.


White is behind, and must find a way to make some points. You have a lot of influence in the center, but that's fairly hard to use, for two reasons :
 - there are no black group to attack
 - the center is quite open for black too, by the top and the left, and a bit by the lower right.

So, you can't really hope to make a lot of points in the center.]
;B[be]C[[MK\] Should he have played A16?

-- 
I think it works.];W[ac];B[cd];W[ad];B[ae];W[ab];B[if]C[[MK\] I'm assuming I should have gotten here (or around here) sooner...

-- 
Yes, instead of playing B16 for instance.
Here black is mapping territory. If you had come here, you might have had a hard time making a lot of territory, but at least black wouldn't have.]
;W[jj]TR[og][hl][oo]C[-- 
It isn't precise enough. This move kind of stands in the open. I suggest these other points.]
;B[ik];W[hk]C[[MK\] This didn't turn out well...

-- 
Right, beware of the double-ataris ! ;o)];B[hl];W[il];B[im]
C[-- 
Ouch.];W[hn];B[jl]TR[ci][qq]C[-- 
I think the game is almost over now. 
Unless something spectacular happens, black is far ahead.

Personnaly, there are two things I would try with white before resigning:

- first, the san-san invasion at R3.
- second, the cut at C11, but it seems hopeless now.];W[ij]
;B[hj];W[jk];B[il]C[-- 
Better to take the stone.];W[kl];B[km];W[ll];B[oh]C[-- 
Good move. Black is expanding his moyo, while white is merely connecting his groups.]
;W[nj];B[on]C[-- 
Another big point taken by black, but he should defend the san-san first.]
;W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[in];W[ho];B[io];W[ip];B[ko];W[qq]C[[MK\] Again, good or bad idea?

-- 
It depends on what you get :o)

If you can live unconditionnaly, it is huge, and should have played it way before (something like move 32). 

If you can get a ko, it is only big, and it could probably have been played a bit earlier.

If you die, too bad...

Anyway, it's a good idea. 

I think you should have died, but I'm really unsure about the result. There are too many variations for me...]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr]
(;W[qs]C[-- 
It's a bad idea to hane here. Hane doesn't give you eyes.
It's better to play at S1, because this way black cannot place a stone at S1, preventing you to make an eye at T1.]

(;B[qo]C[-- 
Black could play T4 instead (see variation).];W[rp]C[-- 
Good try, but it's still dead.]
(;B[ps]C[-- 
Bad move. White can't get eyes that way.
Black should kill cleanly at T3 (see variation)];W[rs]C[-- 
White is dead. White could have lived by ko playing T3 instead.]

(;B[sp]C[-- 
It works (to kill), but it's simpler to play at T3 (the vital point).]
;W[so];B[sq];W[sr];B[ro];W[rq];B[sn]C[[MK\] He could have killed me by playing at T4, right?  Could I have made this live by playing differently before this?

-- 
Yes, black T4 kills.

I don't know if you could have lived if black had played correctly. Probably not.]
;W[sp]C[-- 
All in all, this invasion gained 22 points for white. That's nice, but black is still a lot ahead.]

(;W[mj]C[-- 
Black has more to lose than white here. You should answer his pushing by pushing yourself, see variation.]

;B[hh];W[hb]TR[br]C[--

For instance A2 is quite big (5 points sente-sente I think).]

Here, black played a 1 point gote move.
But:
- There are bigger yose points elsewhere (B1 for example).
- He is leading by about 40 points.
- It is clear that there is a lot of aji in the left side area
- In the few last moves, he lost a liberty there.

He should definitely have taken one move to erase some aji, like E8 for example.]

The sequence white played from here is very nice, insofar as dirty tricks can be, of course ;p)]

-- 

To sum up, I'd say that your biggest mistake in this game was to play too softly. You didn't attack at all black, although he was quite overplaying, having several weak groups.
That's why black was winning by a large margin, at least until you tricked him :o)

I hope I haven't been too confuse, especially in the invasion of the lower right corner, and that you will benefit from my comments.
