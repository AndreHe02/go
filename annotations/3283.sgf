C[I'm playing black.
I chose this one game because it showes how I play normaly, what mistakes do I make.
I lost this one badly, but I think I could win or make it a close game if I wasn't careless (suicidal;) in the end game.

PS: Sorry for my english. I hope you will understand most of it:)

JL: I will try to give you the best advice I can

JL: I hope you can see how to improve in the opening and middle game. There were many chances for you to win the game easily.]
