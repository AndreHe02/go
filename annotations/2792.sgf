RE[B+R]

C[First of all, thanks for your review or reading.

Since I say too many, you don't need to reply/answer everything I say/ask. You may choose to answer some which you feel it is most valuable.

Since I am very weak at Go, more in-depth explanations is very welcome.

Sorry for the typos I might make.

JM: Thanks for letting me review your game.  I think that the most important lesson that can be learned from this game is the benefit of keeping things simple.  This game is full of situations that are incredibly complex and difficult to read/analyze.  Professional players often comment that this is symptomatic of amateur games.

Both players had opportunities that they missed and each needs to be careful of overplays.  In the case of black, being too greedy for a large moyo can cause problems, whereas white seemed too eager to tenuki in several places.

After the white group on the left died (or appeared to), white seemed to lose concentration and played several terrible moves that made the game even more lopsided.  I made little comment about those moves.

All of my comments are marked with 'JM:'  I am a 1kyu on IGS, so please take all of my comments with a grain of salt.  Only professionals can say with any certainty the best move in a position.]
;C[I just know a jot about japenses terms, so when reviewing, it is best to avoid using them (or explain them if use).

When you make your last comment, please indicate that it is the last one. (eg using label "last comment")

Result B+R

Reasons why wanna reviews:
- to improve my Go capibility. I think I am weak at:
 + positional/situational judgement (often don't know where to play)
 + territory calculation (very confused at estimating which party is ahead)
 + life and death (especially the ones which the enemy will play a stone insde my territory to kill all my stones)
- I don't really know how good I am. It would be good if anyone can tell me approximately what ranking I am by reading it


About me:
I think I am 10k only.On one hand, I can defeat even 7k-6k. On the other, I even get a headache to play with 9-10k.
What's more, sometimes the opponent resigns unexpectedly (they said they lost already.) But I haven't realised that. Occassionally I feel I lag behind when the enemy resigns.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pp];W[qd];B[jp];W[qn];B[on];W[pl];B[qo];W[nq]
C[JM: This may be white's first mistake, although it may be playable.  Invading here (fearing a moyo) creates a weak group, although neither side seemed to notice it.  The normal joseki continues at Q6, instead of here.  If white fears a moyo this much, perhaps he should have played R3 instead of Q8.]
;B[oq];W[or]C[Why white plays P2?
To me this seems to jeopardize/compromise itself?

JM: White is struggling for a base here.  P2 is ok, but it may have been better to play more lightly.]
;B[mr]C[It is used to obstruct white's expansion. Good?];W[nr]
;B[pr]
(;W[mp];B[dj]C[Is it good to play D17, or should I play somewhere near the warzone of right bottom corner (eg L2/L3/M3, or R6/R7)?

JM: While this move is rather large, keeping the white bottom stones weak should be your first priority.  A move like D10 is a good example of being "too busy." Don't leave a situation until it's more settled.

The move that comes to mind for the bottom is M5.  This becomes even more clear after the upcoming exchange.]
;W[lq]C[I think white playing N4,M18 is too slow.

JM: White recognizes that his stones are weak.  Settling them is a good idea.]
;B[kr]SQ[mr]MA[jq][kq]C[L2 seems better to me.
It is because:
- I can defend if white plays L3.
- Also L2 ensures the possibility of linking N2 at a later stage (eg endgame).

JM: L2 is a good move to keep white with only 1 eye.];W[oc]
C[I think I did something very wrong after w20. Actually I think I should be ahead of white to play P20.
White can secure at least 12 points for this move.

Q: When is the most appropriate time for me to play P20?

JM: In reality, white played P17 too soon.  In my opinion, the bottom of the board still requires immediate attention.  In this respect, you never had a chance to play P17, because white took it before its time had come.]

(;B[df]C[JM: The bottom stones are terribly important.  You should play there.  See variation.]
;W[fd];B[ff]C[Is this move (F14) too submissive? Any suggestion?

JM: The normal follow-up move to the high approach is C16, which you eventually got to play.  In that respect, there was just a transfer of move order, although white missed a good opportunity.]

(;W[he]C[It makes me feel being ahead here... hmm...];B[cd]
TR[be][ce]MA[bc][cc]C[Better attack the corner first because:
- I don't think there's chance for me to invade deep into the corner, so it is no hurt to strengthen white ("X" mark) by this move.
- The exception for the above is playing 3-3 might be one way. But I think I will escape hardly for life and help white to further strengthening. Not a good idea.
- It seems good to invest for strengthening my side ("triangle" mark).

JM: Yes, this is the right move.];W[cc];B[de]C[JM: Bad shape.  Much better to play C15.  If you should lose the C16 stone, this corner will have been a major victory for white.]
;W[dc]CR[ce]C[The weakness at C15 (red dot) should not be a big problem at the opening stage. I wish to be sente, so I don't fill this up.

And it seems good to me if white really exploit my weakness instantly because I can strengthen my side (and secure my territory).

(see variation2 for details)

What do you think?

JM: See previous comment.  While you're right that capturing c16 is too small right now, it never should have been an option.]

(;MA[hg][je][jf][ji][jj][jk][jn][ke][kf][km][kn][ld][le][lf]
[lm][ln][md][me][mf][mm][mn][pi][pj][qi][qj]C[It is a hard time for me to think where to play. It seems I am weak at positional/situational judgement.

I think fo several moves/areas to play (see the "X" marks).

JM: The most important area is still the bottom and M5 is still my favorite choice there.  Playing in the area will eventually allow you to get plays close to your center marked points, hopefully with sente.  After that sequence is played out, then a move around R10 would probably be called for.]
;B[ji]SQ[ie][jd][je][jf][kd][ke]TR[fo][fp][go][gp][hg][ho][hp]
MA[fg][gh][hi][ii]C[I finally choose here because:
- if white invades by playing at H13, I can defend in the "X" boundaries (but I don't think white will be that unwise to do so).
- if white invades deeper than H13 (upper triangle mark), I can cut its connection at H13 (upper triangle mark) and invade at (square marks).
- it seems K11 can also support sparsely the areas below it.
- Also it might help to play ladder later on when white invades at the left bottom side (lower triangle mark)

JM: This move is very vague.  The Black bottom moyo is large, but still can be invaded.  Remember that the center is always smaller than it seems, and therefore is not as valuable.]
;W[fq]C[Bad move(?). Invade too deep.

JM: Not a terrible move, although it runs the risk of hurting the N4 stones.  Because of this, it may have been better to come from the other side, or simply invade at the 3-3 point.]
;B[fp]SQ[jp][kr][mr]MA[bp][cp][ep][gp][hp]C[I try to lure white to attack my corner. Advantages:
- avoiding the mid bottom stones (square mark) from being disconnected.
- strengthen my "X" boundaries.

[PS: But I don't think white will be trapped so.\]

JM: This is good because it forces white to play towards his weaker stones, allowing K4/L2 to be the perfect splitting attack.]
;W[gp]C[As expected, not attack my corner]
(;B[go]C[I won't let you go.

JM: This is probably an overplay.  See variation.]
(;W[dn]C[hmm... it causes me a while to think over the next move.

JM: As it should.  Here is another case of making things too complex.  White should simply play the variation and punish black's overplay.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[eq];W[fo];B[ep];W[ho];B[gn]
(;W[hq];B[ip]C[I think white's sequence of attack is an overplay.

JM: Not an overplay, but a simple mistake.  White has no hope of capturing G5/G6 and has instead created more trouble for N4. H3 was the critical error, see variation at previous move.]
;W[hn];B[ko]C[JM: This let's white off the hook too easily.]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[nm];SQ[ko][lm]CR[hn][ho]TR[lq][mn][mp][nm][nq]
[nr][or]MA[hp][ip][jp]C[The move at L5 and M7 (square marks) plays 3 roles.
- attack right-hand white stones (triangle marks)
- besiege left-hand 2 white stones (red dot)
- avoid white to re-besiege my 3 black stones ("X" marks)

JM: Yes, moves like these have been begging to be played for the last 30 moves.]
;B[en]C[JM: This move seems a bit odd.  The G5/G6 stones are already safe.  If your goal is to remove more aji from D6, then I suggest either C6 or C8.]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[JM: This move makes it likely that white will live small on the side.]

[ag][bf][bg][cf][cg]C[How to stop this move (B11) from further expanding to upper left  (square marks)?
Confusing?!?

JM: This is why C10 was needed.  At this point, there is little you can do to turn the marked area into territory.]

[ne][nk][pf][pg][pi][pj][qf][qg][qi][qj]C[Hard time again. I don't know where to play.

Several locations (see marks)
Any ideas?

JM: In situations like these, my usual choice is to play the probe of S16.  The variations from there can become complicated, but with no weak groups on the board, Black can afford to try it.  There is also a very important question to be answered about the status of the D9 group.  White took a big risk to play here, and was eventually punished.]

[fo]C[Are white at D6; wF6,5 dead?

(;W[nj];B[lj];W[bm];B[bn];W[bh]TR[ae][af][ag]C[Why not white play A13-15 instead?

JM: White knows he needs the eye space.  Besides, after either B16 or C15, Black cannot make territory there, so A13-15 would be dame.]
;B[bg];W[am];SQ[am][bh][bi][bm][ck][cl]C[Could I kill all whites (square marks) in mid-left side?

JM: I believe the status of this group is determined by who plays the next move.  If black plays, it's probably dead.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[ak];W[ah];B[aj]C[White responds so weirdly?!

After the game, I made a deep think here.

It seems if white had played correctly, I had been suffered.
(see variation2)

Is it really true I could NOT kill all whites (square marks) in mid-left side?

JM: No, white was dead from this point (in my opinion)  I show why in your variation.  Dan players may prove me wrong though.]

(;W[lr]C[Inefficient move to me. White hardly achieve anything great with this move.

I am not going to respond it. Do you think I do right?

JM: Yes, white is better off to pressure the lonely Q10 stone with something like R12.  However, as an exercise you should make sure you know how to defend if white plays K2 next.]
;B[qf]SQ[oc][qd]TR[mc]C[I would like to attack upper right corner. I know white at R16, P17 (square marks) is safely guard the corner.

One I can think of is playing N17 (triangle mark). But since white is so strong on its upper left. It seems unwise to do so.

So what's the best way to undermine white to the max?

JM: The key point to remember is that you don't need to undermine white very significantly at all.  Black already has a won game, so long as he lives on the right side.  Trying for too much could lead to trouble.]

But I played O19 anyway at that moment which is not a bit behind O18 in my view.

C[The super capture race starts.
In fact, I get a real headache about it.

Is there any system to know if I can win the race?

Did I do the best in the race?

JM: In a capture race (semeai) the only way to know if you can win is simply take the time to count how many moves each side needs to capture the other.  Make sure to take into account sente when counting.  In this case, the sequence goes something like this:
bA15
wA14
bA16
wOther
bB1
wB8
bA1
wA11
bA9
wOther
black then needs 2 more moves to capture.

This means white must capture black stones within 3 moves, which cannot be done.  Black will win the race easily.  The important thing is that you started this race.  Had white begun the race, it could have changed the game.  (see variation at move #197)]
