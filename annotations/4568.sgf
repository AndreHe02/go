;B[dd];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp];B[dj];W[jp];B[ko]C[Good opening up until this move, which will allow W to get territory on the bottom side, while B isn't ensured of much.]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[io];B[lo]C[This sequence is definitely better for W. B should play closer to the edge, no farther out than the 4th line.]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[nq];W[nr]
(;B[or]LB[mr:A]TR[mq][nr]C[Unsafe moves by both W and B. If B had played A instead, then it could capture either of the marked stones. Even better for B would be to safely play P3 to allow making large territory on the right side then into the middle using the big wall of stones across the bottom.]
;W[np];B[oq];W[mo];B[ln]C[Flieg [27k?\]: good luck];W[mp]C[This move was not necessary and could have waited until attacked. Playing first in a new area is worth much more, especially in the early stages like now. Don't miss these opportunities.]
;B[op];W[ns];B[os];W[mr];B[lm]LB[pj:A][mn:B]C[This group was quite safe and it would be better to play somewhere around A. Playing at B is also better than what was played since it is solidly connected and limits the expansion of W while moving toward joining with the rest of B on the right.]
;W[pj]C[Excellent. What's good for B if played first by W is usually also good.]
;B[ok]LB[pl:A]C[Again B plays too high. If played on the 4th line such as at A, black could simultaneously make territory on the right side while putting pressure on the single W stone.]
;W[pk];B[ol];W[om]LB[pl:A]C[This move doesn't really make much territory for W or reduce much from B. Better played at A.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[pn]LB[qm:A]C[Similarly here, make territory along the sides before middle areas. Making territory in the middle needs 4 sides and takes more moves, so take corners first, then sides, then middle. Any extension of the W group at N5 will effectively reduce any potential territory of B.]
;B[qn];W[on];B[qm]C[B has now secured the bottom right corner and part of the side.]
;W[oj];B[qo]C[This move wasn't really needed yet. W couldn't really break through while staying connected.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ml];B[mm];W[mj]C[Good move, known as a trumpet connection. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?TrumpetConnection . Now the upper right side is mostly controlled by W and any activity in the centre has support from the right.]

(;B[nm]LB[nn:A]C[If B played at A instead, it could have cut off the three stones and captured them.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[sl];B[sm];W[jd]C[W again plays in a new area first.]
;B[ie]C[B again plays too far from the edge.];W[id];B[he];W[hd]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[fe];W[fd];B[ee];W[ed];B[de]C[Allowing W to make territory along the top side, while B still only has one wall and needs three more to make territory in the centre.]
;W[md]C[Excellent move outlining lots of territory above.];B[cc]
C[The best suggestion for B is to think about playing in a new open area whenever possible, and not just where W played or connected to where B has already played.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ec];B[cb];W[db];B[da];W[ea];B[ca];W[eb];B[ig]
LB[qc:A]C[Good move to make lots of territory for B on the left side. The fight that ensues also makes large territory for W. B would do better to first invade in the top right corner.]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[ji]
(;B[ih]LB[jh:A]C[Play at A is better.];W[jh];B[hj]LB[ij:A]C[Why not at A?]
;W[ij];B[hi];W[il];B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn]
;W[go];B[fn]LB[dn:A][en:B]C[Playing out from a wall is faster at outlining territory and still will eventually become connected by defending when attacked.]
;W[en];B[em];W[eo];B[dm];W[dn];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm];W[am];B[al]
;W[an];B[bl];W[cn];B[jf];W[kf];B[if]C[Not necessary.];W[je]
;B[fm]C[Not necessary. They were already effectively connected since if W tries to play that same move results in self atari and could be captured. It's known as a hanging connection. http://senseis.xmp.net/?HangingConnection]
;W[fo];B[gj]C[Not necessary. If W cut by playing there, B could just atari W upwards until it runs into a black box.]
;W[hm];B[jg];W[kg];B[fg]C[Not really necessary. B is fully connected and W only has a chance of making life near the edge and there's not enough space here to really do that.]
;W[no];B[po];W[ll];B[kl];W[kk];B[km];W[jl];B[jm];W[im];B[jn]
;W[qk];B[oo];W[nn];B[mn];W[in]C[Flieg [27k?\]: end?
mpan [26k\]: Not quite yet.];B[hb]C[Now B starts to attack. Better where there's more room, like in the top right corner or bottom or right edges.]

C[Good kill.];B[ip];W[ir];B[fq];W[hs]C[Flieg [27k?\]: aren't your groups dead?]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[cg];W[rf];B[rg];W[sf];B[sg];W[rf];B[sf];W[rf]
C[W played quite well, showing more initiative than B. B needs to play more loosely, not always solidly connected, outlining territory in the corners, followed by sides, running into the middle when attacked and there's no room to live along the side. Enjoy your future games and try applying what you've learned.]
