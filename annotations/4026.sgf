I'm not completely sure, but I think this is okay. You could protect the cut and ignore [tenuki, or play elsewhere\] if he turned at P7. [see variation\]]

;B[cf];W[ch]C["Good pincer?"

Yes, I think this is a very good move. Your group at the top is in no danger, and this is a pincer/extension from D4. It really limits Black's eyespace, so Black has to run out.]
;B[ef];W[eh];B[gf]
(;W[id]C["Here i just threw the dice because i did not know where to play from my wall to the left. To near? To high?"


Too far, perhaps. Play one stone closer to pressure Black a little more. [see variation\]]
;B[kc];W[jc]C["Perhaps too territory oriented?"

It's okay, but not the best move. You should have moved on the right somewhere. Black is getting large there. On the other hand, however, this makes it harder for Black to connect up top, I think. You may gain more by chasing Black around the board and gain territory on the bottom by doing so.]
;B[kd];W[dl];B[fq];W[eq]C[This is a good move, I think. It either makes Black heavy if he extends [and leaves him with no base\], or too light if he moves too far away [like he did\]. [see variations\]]

This is okay. It presses him down and gives you some territory on the left. [see variations\]]

It seems like the only choice at the moment. Black has blocked you out from just reducing and you have to invade. [see variations\]]

This is mostly direction of play. Also, think about what your moves are going to do after you play them, how they effect the whole board. [For example, the lower right and upper left corners\] The middlegame is mostly reading skills and life and death, so I'd work on that. Also, when invading/reducing it's good to check and see if you could live in the space..if not, run out. If so, go ahead and reduce some more. Run out and get more eyespace by pressuring your opponent, either threatening his own groups or threatening to connect out to your own. And remember good shape, always important in general, fighting more specifically. You have to have a good framework to work with. Your endgame seemed pretty good, judging by your moves. You can usually eat up a lot of points by chiseling away at the edges of the groups.]
