C[I think you played a nice game here. Your opening was a little bit shaky, but you played a good middle game, and could have turned the game.]

TR[rd][qf]C[I dont like the idea of leaving the marked stones alone :)
I think, that if you want to play fast, then you should omit s16.]

(;B[qm]LB[qh:A]C[I would attack immediately with A. (See Variation)]
;W[pq]LB[po:A][op:B]C[I think I made a mistake here : I helped black close me in the corner

Yeah, well A and B are the joseki, but i think this is not losing too much points, really]
;B[op];W[pn]LB[po:A][qo:C][or:B]C[I have never seen this move ^^;;
A is most common and B is if white is desperate for life.
Black should punish with C (see variation)]

;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[nn];B[mp]C[it was good for black, but I had to play it to get  my group out

The game looks good for black, yes.];W[ic]C[gepay [3k\]: allo]

(;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[ch]LB[cc:C][cl:A][fq:B]C[I prefered to play for moyo rather than attack (the lower black group)

Okay, if you like moyo, then i will recommend a few things, if its ok. Try playing large scale, for exmaple A instead of B (See Variation)
In this position i think you should try making some territory, because blacks territory is quite solid, so you cant attack with  strength, thats why i would prefer territory from moyo.
C is wide open and if black gets to invade he takes a solid lead]
;B[rc];W[re];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[ed]LB[cb:A]C[isnt  A the normal move for white?]

(x is whites territory mark and square1 is blacks)
White = 48.5
Black = 45 

so actually white has more points, but.... Black is very thick, so almost surely he will make more points, but its still a fairly close game]

Yes! you should maintain the attack on the black group! And you dont lose that much]
