grrr [8k\]: hi




hi,
i am mainly intrested in strategic mistakes i made(black),
and the direction of play];B[pd]C[gono55 [6k\]: hi];W[dp]C[grrr [8k\]: have a good game]
;B[pq]C[gono55 [6k\]: to];W[dd];B[jp];W[dj];B[pk];W[nc];B[nd]
C[AB: Possible. I would prefer a pincer, the attach-and-extend josiki is not often seen in even games. 


s this a good joseki choice?];W[md];B[ne];W[ob];B[pb]LB[me:A]
[oc:B][pc:C][qc:D]C[AB: Many moves are possbile here. Your move is one of them. Others are indicated.

i improvised whith this move  is it the correct move?];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[oc];B[qe]LB[qb:A]C[AB: You should connect at 'A' here.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pa];B[me]C[AB: This is a good move, but you see that the loss in the corner is not small. A white cut at s17 will cause more problems. A success for White.]
;W[ld]C[AB: The move you play is good. Another idea which is consistent with the moyo focus of the game is to go for the center with a move like L10.

what is the biggest point on the board now?];B[fq];W[dn];B[fc]
LB[fo:A]C[AB: I would follow up with 'A'. This is an important juction point and consistent with your previous play.]

(;W[df]C[AB: In the end, Black gets a solid base too easily. There must be a better way for White. I add some variations.]

(;B[db]
(;W[cc];B[ic]C[AB: Success for Black.];W[po]
(;B[qo]LB[np:A]C[AB: Not so good. You want to attack the White stone, so attaching is not an option here. 'A' would be normal. It makes points by attacking (see variation).]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]
(;W[or]LB[pn:A]C[AB: Mistake. 'A' is the only option (see variation).]
;B[pn];W[no];B[on]C[AB: Good.

any alternatives?];W[mp];B[dr]LB[kq:A][hq:B]C[AB: I think 'A' is more interesting as it has an effect on both weak groups on the lower side. Your move does not protect against an invasion at 'B'.]

(;W[cq]LB[hq:A]C[AB: Good opportunity to tenuki. A direct invastion at 'A' seems possible (see variation).]
;B[lr]LB[kq:A][mm:B]C[AB: I would still prefer 'A', as it helps your group as well. A play on the second line at this early stage is not so advisable, only if you are sure you kill with that move. But White is not so weak, can probably even live locally and has space to run away as well. An alternative may be 'B'. You force White to live locally and you may be able to get a lot of points on the right. Your own group at the bottom may be too weak for this option, though.

what is the best way to attack white?];W[kq]C[AB: You see that your own weaknesses get exploited very well by White in this sequence. White has good shape and can go all out. Your stones were too loose. M2 was clearly an overplay.]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[lp];W[lo];B[jr];W[jq];B[iq];W[ip];B[jo];W[ir]
;B[hq];W[kr];B[ko];W[js];B[hr];W[mr];B[ln]C[AB: Good forcing move!]
;W[mo];B[ho]C[AB: Correct.];W[kn];B[jn];W[km]
(;B[dl]C[AB:: The fight for the right hand side may be more important. You might want to close your wall (see variation).]
;W[ck]LB[mm:A]C[AB: White 'A' is big. The White move is not so good as it will isolate the corner in the long run.]
;B[cm]LB[cl:A]C[AB: Not good, just descend to 'A'.];W[cn]LB[cl:A]
C[AB: Now White can still connect at 'A'.];B[fl];W[bm]TR[cm]
[dl][fl]C[AB: Big success for White. No more problems, territory more or less secured, the three Black stones are more a burden than anything else.]
;B[lb]LB[lm:A]C[AB: Now is the time to close the wall with 'A'.]
;W[qn]C[AB: There is some aji, but I don't see anything that works right away.]
;B[rq];W[ql];B[qm];W[pl]
(;B[qk]LB[ol:A]C[AB: The overall result you get from this sequence is bad. But it's hard to point to any specific mistake. Under all circumstances you must prevent White from connecting to his other group, so I guess here 'A' would have been a better option (see variation).]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[rk]
(;B[rj]LB[ol:A]C[AB: Last moment for 'A'.];W[qj];B[ri];W[qi]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm]C[AB: Painful.]
;B[mm]LB[ni:A]C[AB: Useless. Play 'A' instead, which is the key point between the two weak groups.]
;W[mk];B[ni]C[AB: Good.];W[ph];B[qg];W[nh];B[mi];W[lk]TR[ml]
[mm][ln]C[AB: The loss of the stones is painful, but it was too late.]
;B[mh]C[AB: Very good! Proper move.];W[gm]TR[cm][dl][fl]C[AB: I told you, these three stones are nothing but a burden... :-)]
;B[jm];W[kl]LB[dh:A]C[AB: It is time to evaluate the board. Intuitively, I'd say the game is promising for White. Black has a good 30 points in the centre and ten each on top and bottom left and right for a total of 60. White has ten points on the left, more than 20 on the bottom and a little less than ten on top plus komi for a total of 45. Ah, no komi, so 40 then. On the left there is however easiliy 20 more points to be made. There is only one conclusion: You need to invade on the left now. 'A' is the way to go.]
;B[gk]C[AB: The stones are light. It is not absolutely necessary to save them.]
;W[jl];B[fm];W[gn];B[gi];W[mg]LB[dh:A]C[AB: I think if White plays at 'A' now, the game will be very difficult for Black.]
;B[ng];W[oh];B[lg];W[he]LB[le:A][ji:B][dh:C]C[AB: Bad, just in the middle of nowhere. If White wants to prevent a Black centre, there are better options: 'A', 'B'. Still, this is not urgent, so 'C' is still the way to go. Attacking Black's center group willl be difficult.]
;B[fe];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[id];B[gd];W[hd];B[jd];W[je]
;B[kd];W[ke]C[AB: Much ado about nothing.];B[jb];W[lc];B[le]
;W[kb];B[if]C[AB: Big mistake! These are the things that must be avoided under all circumstances!]
;W[jc];B[ib]TR[if]C[AB: You wasted one stone, lose points, and end in gote!]
;W[ge];B[fd];W[ff];B[cb];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh]LB[jg:A]C[AB: 'A' is better.]
;B[kf];W[jg];B[jf];W[kc];B[ji];W[ki];B[lh];W[ii]
(;B[jj]C[AB: The Black middle group must not be forgotten! A save way to connect them is the variation.]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[gh];B[ih];W[hi];B[ik];W[im];B[io];W[ij];B[jk]

(;W[il]C[AB: A 'Thank you'-move on White's part. He can play much more aggressive than that (see variation).]
;B[hj];W[fi];B[gj];W[gg]C[AB: Black has about 75 points, I think. White has a little more I think, thanks to the left-hand side, which is now big.]

(;B[bc]LB[ce:A]C[AB: I think 'A; is possible. You need to reduce big, if it is possible. Otherwise the game is lost (see variation).]

;W[ek]C[AB: The losing move. White loses his biggest asset. Connecting was absolutely necessary. The first thing is to avoid catastrophes like this. Only afterwards is it useful to study opening and direction.]

(;W[mn];B[mq];W[nq]C[AB: Funny situation at the end. I think the most important thing for you is to evaluate the relative strengths of groups at every moment of the game. Also, try to anticipate problems ahead of time. First save your own weak groups, then you can go all-out in attack.
