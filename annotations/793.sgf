C[Dear reviewer!

I (black) was a bit outplayed in this game. White played some uncertain moves and suddenly had a magnificant moyo in the middle of the board. White plays look not like standard moves, so where did I fall into his trap? I have no clue...]

;W[ed];B[dp];W[pp];B[qn];W[np];B[pj];W[gp];B[eq]LB[dn:a]C[Ba is the standard answer.]
;W[cm];B[bp]LB[en:a][jp:b][cj:c]C[sita: Maybe this is not best, but I feard that w played b4 if I play e6 or something.

eek: Running out to 'a', dividing him, seems better. You can then aim at a pincer at 'b' or 'c'. Don't spend too many moves in the opening passively defending corner territory!]

(;B[ec]C[The variation is better.];W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[pc];W[bf]
C[eek: Good exchange for W. B should have crawled once earlier.]
;B[bd];W[nj];B[ph];W[nh];B[kc]C[eek: Too low - at least play on the 4th line to reduce the moyo better.]
;W[ke]C[Of course I saw the magnificiant white moyo, but at this time I could not think that it would become a real territory threat.

eek: W's stones are cooperating well.];B[lf]LB[hk:a]TR[cm][fm]
[gp]C[sita: Nevertheless, this looks like an emergency measure. What would be a cool play in this position?

eek: Right, this will hurt your position at the top, but, splitting his position, it is not too bad. Maybe somewhere around 'a'? If you build a group here, you may be able to exploit the thinness of the three marked stones.]
;W[le];B[nf];W[og];B[pg]LB[qf:a]C[eek: 'a' might be better.]
;W[of];B[me];W[oe]LB[md:a]C[eek: I think you have to play 'a' now and suffer a bit in the corner.]

;B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[pk];B[hj]C[eek :Good!];W[qj];B[qi]LB[fj:a]
TR[cm][fm]C[eek: Small, instead you walk in with 'a', which is huge in itself and also threatens the thinness of the marked two stones.]

;W[jn];B[gh];W[eh];B[gr]C[eek: Fairly big!];W[nc];B[hf]TR[eh]
[fj][fm][jn]C[eek: No need to play here, it is gote and if he threatens your group you should be able to make eyes by leaning on the marked stones.
The bottom is big.];W[ir]C[eek: Big - now Black has less than 70 points and W seems to have more.]

;W[pm];B[ob];W[sn];B[mb]C[sita: At this point I was a bit lucky, I think. n18 seems to be bigger than r8. If I had not got this, I could as well resign by now. But still w is leading.

But seki was too much, so I resigned two moves later.
