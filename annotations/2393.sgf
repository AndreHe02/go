C[I played black in this game.
I'd like to hear from you what I should do to improve my skill.]

(;W[bo]C[gawron: C7 seems to be more popular currently.];B[fo]
;W[jq];B[cn]C[Is this stone at the right place?
gawron: Yes, is the right move. Actually, I think white B5 was a mistake (if he intended to answer F5 at K3).]

(;W[bn]C[gawrn: Oops. Another mistake by white.];B[cm];W[br]
C[gawron: I would not change any of black's move. Black is doing very well.]
;B[lq]C[gawron: This is not a bad move, but since white has no urge to extend to N3, playing a kakari in the upper left corner or playing around K17 might make the game easier for black.]
;W[jo];B[lo]C[gawron: Now that you ended in gote, white can take the initiative.]
;W[ce];B[ic];W[qf];B[nd];W[qi];B[qk]C[gawron: before R9, exchanging R15 for Q14 is usual, in order not to allow white to stabilize by skiding in the corner]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qo]TR[lo]SQ[qk]C[gawron: Now you have to proof that M5 was a good move. 
Of course, white's move is dangerous since he's outnumbered locally. But if he could somehow launch a counter-attack on R9, the game would be open again.]
;B[qp];W[ql]C[gawron: Ouch. This actually helps black.];B[pk]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[nm];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[lm]LB[pf:A][pi:B]
TR[qf][pg][qg][ph][qh][qi]C[gawron: I think you should add another stone at A instead - I would not like the bad aji.]
;W[ml];B[mk]LB[mj:A]TR[jo][gq][jq]C[Is this the right direction?
gawron: Yes!
- It strengthens the right side
- It induces the following black moves, preparing an attack on the marked white stones.
However, N10 is better technique, N9 is "tooth paste technique", squeezing white to the outside :-)]
;W[ll];B[km];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[ip];W[jp];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr]
;W[jr];B[hq];W[in];B[gp];W[il];B[jl]C[gawron: Just playing Q5 would be sufficient.]

(;W[jk]C[gawron: Another bad move by white.];B[im];W[hm];B[jm]

;B[mr];W[kq];B[lp];W[ks];B[is];W[fh];B[gh]C[gawron: Bad shape - H11 is better.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[eh];B[hh];W[hj];B[fk]C[gawron: This might have been your losing move - G11 is the only move!]

(;W[el]C[gawron: Are you two reading at all?
Of course, G11 is the only move for white, capturing the black stones!]
;B[hi]C[Is it better at G11 instead of H11?];W[gi];B[gj];W[hk]
;B[gi];W[hg];B[jh];W[ih];B[ii];W[ig]
(;B[ki];W[jj];B[ji];W[mg]C[gawron: You should play M11 to create aji.]

SQ[mg][pg][ph][li][hj][jj][lj][mj][hk][ik][jk][lk][mk][ok][pk]
[qk][il][ll][ml][pl][ql][nm][qo]C[gawron: Now the position has changed - both black and white have two problems. You should not have allowed white to play M11! What would you do if white played Q14 now?]

(;W[ge];B[gf]C[Can I capture this 4 white stones?
I made many mistakes here.
What should I do in this kind of situation?
gawron: You pulled out the cutting stone too early. 
Wether you can capture the 4 white stones is a difficult but maybe not the most important question - white Q14 is still troublesome.]

;B[ee];W[ec];B[nh]C[gawron: At last, you decided to defend the important left side. But this move still leaves aji (as you saw in the game). P14 would have been the proper move.]

(;B[pj]C[Is it ok to place at P10 instead of this Q10?
gawron: White could still capture N9 and N10, so there is no big difference.]

(;B[id]C[gawrn: This is a very bad move - K16 would get more liberties. Actually L19 is best.]
;W[hb];B[oj]C[gawron: As long as there is the ko aji, you should not try to kill white as you are losing important liberties.]
;W[nj];B[ol];W[om];B[pn]LB[ja:C][kg:B][mh:A]C[gawron: This is an overplay as long as A and B are more or less sente and black can start a ko at C.]
;W[po];B[on];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[ko]C[I think it's better simply placed at M6, am I right?
gawron: Yes, but the game is already over - one point more or less makes no difference. Avoiding the ko on the upper side would have been more important ...]
