C[I am a beginner. I
have played GO for about 6 months.

I played this game in BEGINNER ROOM in YAHOO.

I used black. My opponent went away after my last move.
I don't know why. Is black at a very good condition?
Also I would like to know my rank.

Thank you for your attention.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[dc]
;W[np];B[nq]C[this is a passive
response, but not too bad.  Attaching at Q5 is more interesting, but very
complicated.];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[lq];W[pj];B[ce]C[After W12 at Q10, the right side is very
important, so R12 or R13 is big.];W[jc];B[oc]C[The moves flow more
naturally here if you play H17, white answers at N17, then you block with
this move at P17.  Alternatively you could start by playing all the way to
M17, then white G17, and you play R12 or R13.  P17 doesn't attack white's
lone stone at K17.];W[qg];B[lc];W[gc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq]
;B[ck]C[Black now has low positions everywhere, and white
has very valuable stones in front of black shimari at G17 and R13.  White
should have an easy game.];W[nd];B[nc];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[md]
;W[me];B[mc];W[ne];B[jb];W[ic]C[White gets even more strong control of the
center while black gains only a few points on the edge.];B[iq]
C[Another
fairly small move by black, low and close to the edge.  The big issue now
is the large center white is getting.  K4 or K5 is more like the right
direction, and perhaps M10 or thereabouts would be the real key
point.];W[bq];B[dh]C[A slow defensive move, taking a few points of
territory but leaving white to control the whole center right
still.];W[pd];B[qc];W[jj];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko];W[kn];B[ln];W[mo]
;B[jo];W[km];B[im];W[hj]C[This white move goes a little too far.  Better to strengthen the
connection, at K8.  Black can't get much territory here anyway since white
can come in from F4 or
G17.];B[ik];W[ij];B[kl];W[jl];B[jm];W[lm];B[jk];W[ll];B[kk]
;W[mj]C[White's territory is much smaller
now.];B[qf];W[pg];B[qp];W[po];B[pf];W[of];B[rg];W[rh];B[rf]
;W[qi];B[bo];W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[ci];W[eh];B[dg];W[fi]C[White is holding
black down to a minimum on this side.  The score looks close but white
seems to have the lead still.];B[ff];W[hf];B[fr];W[er];B[eq]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[dr];B[eo];W[ep];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[ec];B[db]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[ee];B[ef];W[eb];B[od];W[kj];B[lk];W[mk];B[lj]
;W[li];B[dk]C[At this point, black has 30 points in
the lower right, 40 on the left side, and 30 on the upper right, roughly
100 total.  White has 10 in the lower left corner, and 82  in the big
center.  White seems to have fallen just a bit behind, but then it's
white's move to play, say, J18 next.  If black answers that, and black
answers D19, and white then gets to play T5, I think that ends with white
having a slight lead.  ANyway a very close game, and based on what little I
see here, I'd say black is in the mid kyus (10k or so) by AGA rating.
It's hard to tell, though, since there's no real fighting in this game (no
weak groups to attack or defend).  Black seems to be a fine defender but a
weak attacker.])
