C[[arnauld\] I won with black by resign but it was a tight game and I feel very unconfortable with it. I certainly made plenty of mistakes, but I can't figure exactly where.

[Migeru\] there are both strategic and tactical mistakes, on both sides.]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[dq];W[pc];B[oq];W[pn]LB[nn:C][pn:1][lp:B][lq:A]
[qq:D]C[[arnauld\] I was very surprised by that. I hesitaded a lot between a, b, c and d.

[Migeru\] see the variations.]
(;B[nn]LB[op:A]C[[arnauld\] I played here not to let white gain major influence on the right side. But with white playing 'a', I think that I mess something...

[Migeru\] a long knight's jump is not really a solid connection so you are not really containing white.]

(;B[co]LB[co:B][do:A]C[[arnauld\] I hesitated between there and 'a'. I wanted to build a moyo on south and to secure left corner.

{Migeru\] 'Moyo' is playing for influence, and 'securing the corner' is territorial play. B secures the corner, A works better with your stones on the right to make a moyo.]

SQ[oj]C[[arnauld\] a or b ? I would like to connect square stone with triangle one.
I decided to play 'b' to try to link by attacking white.

[Migeru\] white is playing low and leaving weaknesses behind. I don't recommend playing A. B is ok, but C is probably best because it works well with the squared stone.]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[qj]
(;W[ok]TR[pi]C[[Migeru\] this is bad because it forces black to protect against white's play at Q11.]
;B[pj];W[rk]
(;B[ml]LB[mk:A]TR[nk]C[[arnauld\] Mistake I think. 'a' was the good one.

[Migeru\] this definitely leaves you open to (and almost invites) a cut at the triangled point.]

[pk]SQ[pc][qe][qg][qh]C[[arnauld\] It's a mess...now, triangle stones are very vulnerables !

[Migeru\] black needs to make some eyespace fast. Nut white's group is very weak, too.]

(;W[dj]LB[cj:A]C[[Migeru\] White should attack black's group instead.

(;B[kq]LB[lp:C][lq:A][nq:B]C[[Migeru\] But I think I made a big mistake by playing there. I still hesitate between 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
