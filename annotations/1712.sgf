C[bucky:  hello, I am Mark Fyffe (bucky 2k on KGS), and played white in this game.  i felt that I got off to a good start, but got roped into a big fight and ended up losing.  I have noted places that I am specifically curious about, but any advice is welcome :-)  Thank you in advance for looking over my game.

So the main pieces of advice are:

1) when you are a log way ahead, don't get involved in a big fight. Instead, work out where your dangers are, and defend those groups. You are already ahead on territory, so it does not matter if you opponent makes a little bit more while you defend.

2) Try to play moves that had a purpose. Both players in this game make moves that are pretty much irrelevant. You need to keep track of what is going on and therefore where the important moves are. You should always have a definite plan. You should know what your moves are trying to achieve.

3) If you are in a big fight, don't miss the tesuji that saves you endangered group ;-) Or to put it another way, you can never study too many life and death problems.]

;B[jd];W[mp]C[bucky: i played this opening five games in a row today, and each time had a very interesting game.  i won all of the games but this one quite easily despite black getting a huge moyo on the upper side.  any comments on my opening play and the early middle game would be more than welcome ;-)

Well, it is a reasonable idea. Quite similar to O3, but you have put less pressure on the corner. On the other hand you won't get pincered. Swings and roundabouts.]
;B[on]C[This is a little odd. Q6 would be normal.];W[qf]C[This is OK. You could also think about the wedge at R9 or 10 or 11, which mightly make P6 look like it is in the wrong place.]
;B[qh]C[Of course.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[jj]
C[bucky: at a loss for what to do, I play tengen.  what other choices do I have?

Well, you are playing on the boudarly between two moyos, which is reasonable enough. You could also consider F13 and N6.

If you want to invade deeply, R8 is probably quite safe.

Also, a shimari, say at F3 must be OK.];B[mn];W[jp]
(;B[lj]C[This fells a bit timid by black. I would have played K6. See variation.]
;W[qq]C[bucky: the play from here to move 48 seems a preview of how black wants to play the game.  I think I came out of this with the better deal, but cannot be sure.  I wanted to get this corner in sente and start building a big moyo in the center left to counter black's big spaces, but what happened is quite different.  Should black let the right side be erased so easy, is there a misread here?

I think that this invasion is a good idea. You want to make it look like black's last move only surrounded a small amount of territory, and taking away the corner is a good way to do that. The other place you want to play is S12, which is a big sente endgame move for you. Black has to answer at R11 (or you cross-cut). So really, the black area on the right side is not very big.

Of course, finishing in sente might be a little bit optimistic, becuase black has the extra stone at P6 in place, so living is harder than normal for you.]

;W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[rn];W[pn];B[oo];W[rm];B[np]C[I think that this is a good exchange for you. Mow M10 looks silly. It was meant to be surrounding territory. What territory? In comparison, you had not invested so much at the bottom, and anyway, your stones ther are still worth somehing.]

(;W[pl]C[bucky: is this overplay?  i want to completely erase the right side, but this is clearly gote. is it too slow?

Yes, it is too slow. If you leave this move out, I can't see a way for black to make much territory. I would play something like D9.]
;B[cn]C[Black could also consider C9, leaving an extension either way.]

(;W[co]C[Definitely wrong.

You should only play this move if there is a white stone around C or D, 9 or 10, already acting as a pincer.

Probably you should pincer in this position. See variation.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj]C[Look, white has a perfect "extend three from a two stone wall", and you helped him to get it.

That is why you should only play the diagonal attachment if there is already a stone in the middle of the side to get in the way of back's ideal extension.]
;W[dh]C[This is not very good.

It does not surround any white territory. It does not defend any weak white groups. It does not invade any black territory, and it does not attack any weak black groups (it just encourages black to defend, and to  make his group really safe).]
;B[ej];W[gg]C[This is also not very good, for the same reasons as you last move. 
Admittedly, you are slightly helping the white stone in the middle, and stlightly threatening black at the top, but only very slowly.]
;B[jh];W[ki]C[What is the point of this?

If you want a suggestion, try K14 instead.];B[kh];W[li];B[lh]
C[The stones at L and M 12 seem to make a positive contribution to black's position. I am not realy sure what the white stones at L and M 11 achieve.]

(;B[mi]C[bucky:  now i am very happy with my position, but still i lose the game.  where does the trouble begin?

Yes. White top left is bigger than black at the top. Black doesn't really have any other territory, but white has the bottom.

So, how can you lose? by getting a big group into trouble.

So a good move for you now might be K6. Then black probably can't capture more than 3 stones, and so you have won.

I don't like black's last move. See variation.];W[jl]C[Good.]

(;W[df]C[Why? Surely connecting at H13 is much more important.]
;B[hi]
(;W[hj]C[This seems to be the wrong direction again, but perhaps it is necessary.

My first impression is to play J11 to try to connect, or capture a stone for one eye. But that does not work terribly well, see variation.]

;W[fl];B[ep]C[Now you should count: do you need to save the corner?

Probably yes, but it is dangerous.];W[dq];B[eq];W[lm]C[bucky: from here to the end of the game is a big fight.  How could this have played out differently?]

;B[dr];W[cr];B[fr]C[Good moves by black the threaten both the corner and the outside. This is why saving the corner was so dangerous.]
;W[cs];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[lp];B[kr];W[io];B[in];W[ko]C[Since what you cut off gets two eyes simply, cutting may not be the most important thing. H6 to capture the pottential cutting stones while making an eye pretty much leaves you alive, and you still have more territory.]

C[Now, black has an eye and white does not, and there are lots of shared liberties. Not good.]
;W[jn];B[ip]C[This costs liberties. Before the last two move you had two liberties here. Now you only have one. Admitedly there is now a ko, but I doubt that there will be any ko threats big enough by the time you are in atari.]
;W[rg];B[gk];W[fk];B[hk];W[gj];B[fq];W[gq];B[em]C[Now white has 5 outside liberties (black F6 is sente so assume that it has been played). Black has at least 7 liberties. Actually, I think it is 9 once you count the approach moves. It can hardly even be called a semei when you are that far behind.]
