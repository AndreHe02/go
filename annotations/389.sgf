;B[dq]C[Dear reviewer, thanks for your time.  This game I played black (22k*).  My principal concerns during the development were with moves related to attack and defense.  I have the feeling that during the biggining and middle game my play was well oriented, but later it messed up. :)]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[ck];W[jd];B[cf];W[fd];B[nq]C[I played o3, think now it was perhaps too early or defensive now.  Where would you recomend?

Perhaps a move around K3 or Q10... This breaks the board into two even moyos, and, as black, you might want to be a bit more agressive.]

;W[mk];B[hd]C[I doubted between n7 (building framework), o17 and h16.  I thought h16 divided more and related better with d14 group.  Advice?

Well, N7 would have solidified your moyo, but white's top right as well (W would probably play around N16). Your attack is too weak, there is too much W strength around you. You have more room on the top right, say N16 or Q14.]
;W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[nc]C[Played o17.  But looking back, I didn´t have clear wether to attack corner or try to link h16.  But I don´t see well.  perhaps o17 not good move.

You're a bit far to link to H16. You want to live here, to reduce W's moyo.]
;W[pf];B[ne]C[L17 would have given you a base to try and get eye space on top. Here you are running right into white's strongest area.]

(;B[oh]C[I tried to kill o13 and p14 groups but failed.  was it possible, or better not play p12?


You got some good out of the attack, but I have the feeling you could have done much better.

Instead of P12, try   B - O 10
W - O 9
B - P 11
W - P 12
B - Q 11
W - Q 12

I've tried to do this as a variation from the previous move. I'm not sure you will be able to read the variation in the file.]

In that last sequence, it seems you were playing blindly, trying to save a few stones, rather than looking ahead to see what you could save by a sacrifice. Learn to let go of your stones when you need to, to sacrifice a few in order to keep many.]
