Josh Larson <joshual000 10k on kgs>

I haven't played too much 9x9, hopefully my comments will help.]
;B[gc];W[gg];B[cc];W[cg]
(;B[ee]LB[ed:B][ee:A]C[In my first three moves I was attempting to capture the star points in a usual opening-gambit fashion

Josh: Star points really aren't incredibly signifigant - not nearly as much as good shape.

E5 creates weaknesses at F6 & D6.

E6 (variation) is a similar idea, but avoids the weakness axploited by white.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ec]LB[ec:A][fc:B]C[On move 6 (W F6) white takes advantage of a poorly-attempted connection.  E7 is in preparation to connect the stones:  whatever white plays next, I have a stone somewhere that E7 can connect to.

Josh: a shoulder hit  (as F6 is to G7) should almost always be defended by a solid connection (see F8 variation)

Also the corner is worth more than the center influence, this was one of the themes of the game (not taking the corner territory you initially carved out)]
;W[fc]
(;B[dc]LB[fb:C][dc:A][gd:B]C[Josh: This side is not as threatened as the corner. Defend the corner!!

(G6 or F8 variations)]
(;W[eg]LB[gb:C][gd:B][eg:A]C[Josh:White should attack the corner here]

(;B[ef]LB[gd:B][ef:A]C[Here I wanted to try to stop white from expanding to cover the whole bottom half of the board; one of my most common mistakes is missing the forest for the trees, concentrating on a tactical battle in one part of the board while my opponent sketches out or solidifies territory elsewhere.

Josh: once again the upper right corner is more urgent (see 2nd G6 version)]
;W[fe]
(;B[ed]LB[ed:A][ce:B]C[Just securing the connection between the two groups.


Josh: this connection is quite thick, your stones gain more when they are further apart (upper-right corner ignored) C5 or C4 look bigger and more profitable than E6 (they also keep you connected)

See variation];W[ce]C[Josh: white takes the points as profit]

(;B[cd]LB[fb:B][cd:A]C[Again, wanting to keep white ouf of the top side of the board.


Josh:Defending your territory is a good theme, however the point at F8 is probably worth more (variation)]
;W[ff]C[Josh: again white doesn't attack the corner];B[fb]C[Just thought I'd cap white off while I still could, before he played at F8 and began to expand.  Under more favorable circumstances it might have been the beginnings of shi-cho, but here white's formation was too much developed.

Josh: good move];W[gd]
(;B[hd]LB[hc:B][hd:A]C[Attempted isolation of White continues, although in retrospect I should have felt more ill at ease with a relatively loose connection and enemy stones knocking at my door.

Josh: this double-hane is unstable (as proven later) better is H7
(variation)];W[he]
(;B[be]LB[hb:B][be:A][df:C]C[Josh: more urgent is defending the double-atari @ H7


However, if attacking white is your goal, better in this area is D4 (variation)]
;W[bf];B[cf]C[I accidentally play into atari going after the white stone at C5.  I'll make this mistake several more times throughout the course of the game.

Josh: it's been said that the player who makes the least mistakes wins (hard for me to find any mistakes in pro games, or even dan games, but the quote seems to fit here)

B6 or H8 may have been better...];W[df];B[de];W[cf]
(;B[bb]LB[bb:A][bd:B]C[An attempt to prepare for a future second eye.

Josh: not necessary, better is to keep white out @ B6 (variation)]
;W[hc]C[Move 28 kicks off something of a miai for white.  Even I know better than to play at J6, which as far as I can tell would only cause my death...]

(;B[ic]LB[gb:B][ic:A]C[...but I do try vainly to cut off the white stone at H7, only dimly realizing he has my other stone (H6) in atari anyway.]

(;W[id]LB[gb:B][id:A]C[Josh: as you said, white was better with G8]
;B[gb]C[Securing the second point to a greater extent.  Still hoping to connect to the main group at E8.]
;W[ib]C[The play at J7 (move 29) ends up not only failing but gaining white another capture and a great degree of security.  (Methinks J7 is a false eye since black stones at J9, H8, and J7 again would capture white J8, but a white connection at J7 could secure a major potential second eye.)

Josh: at this point things are pretty settled.  J7 could become a false eye, but it's of little matter since white really owns one mega-group spread across the board.  plenty of space for eyes elsewhere.]

(;B[ha]LB[ha:A][bd:B]C[Vauge threat towards J8.  Just played for instinct and not distinct purpose.

Josh: B6 is more urgent as in the upper-right is more settled]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[dh]C[Attempted invasion into White's territory in the lower board, although at this point I should have realized he pretty much has the lower half of the board secured.

Josh: invasions tend to be more fruitful before the area has been as established.]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[fi];B[di]C[A brief but depressingly futile attempt to save the black group.]
;W[gh];B[ac];W[ad];B[hb]C[Trying to claim at least some of the territory for myself with a couple of connections (A7 and H8).]

[eb][dd]C[evat [21k\]: thanks for this game
Lothe [24k?\]: Nicely played :)

Josh: Basically after the first 2 moves, your focus changed from corner & side secure territory, to central play (which usually only amounts to influence on other areas of the board)

Obvious mistakes aside, there were several missed opportunities to take secure territory or to secure your corners/side.

A common theme in go is making a secure base and then extending from it into the center.

As the proverb states: make a fist before attacking.  

Also a few opportunities to attack were missed, (previous variations) but they were not as critical as defending your territory.

Otherwise, just keep playing!  You'll start to notice some common corner/side play.  Recognition of these patterns will come with experience.

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game.  Best of luck with your go career!
