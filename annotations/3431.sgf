C[itso [2k\]: hi there!
Javaness [5k\]: did I get the time settings right?
Javaness [5k\]: hi
Javaness [5k\]: enjoy the iwamoto game
itso [2k\]: yes I think so....];B[qc]C[itso [2k\]: enjoy, and good luck]
;W[po];B[eq];W[dd];B[pq]C[is this too soon? I didn't really know where to play here. Perhaps the shimari is better?
MR: I think that your move is one of several possibilities. I guess it is more a matter of style whether you prefer Q3 or C14 or C4 or ... Usually it is not too urgent to play under 5-4, as you have the option of 3-3 (usually with simpler josekis than 3-4).]
;W[np];B[nq]C[MR: As far as I know, the joseki starting with O3 is only played when the ladder after cutting at N4 is favourable for black (which is not the case in this game).]
;W[mq]
(;B[nr]C[is this a joseki mistake?
MR: The standard joseki after O3 is the variation just shown, but it does not work with the ladder being good for white. Therefore, R5 instead of O3.]
;W[mo];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro]C[MR: Why not R4?];W[pp];B[qq];W[nd]
;B[pf]SQ[qf]C[1 point too high, or just wrong?
MR: Mirroring at the 45 degree line is one standard technique for the 3-3 point. Of course, the right side is now not very interesting for black and Q14 is open to R12, so maybe R14 is better.]
;W[ph];B[qm]C[i think this fails to white's cut, but perhaps the aji is usable, in any case i didn't see a good alternative. Where is biggest for Black now?
MR: My feeling is thet R7 is not an urgent area of the board. I personally would play C14. The idea would be to take the left side and to open a fight when white invades the lower left corner.]
;W[pn];B[rn];W[pl];B[cf];W[fd];B[ci]C[MR: I would prefer a wider extension to make a better balance with E3.]
;W[cp];B[cn]SQ[cq][eq]C[I also considered the atachment, but I felt this worked better with the two stones above and it was okay to treat 3-5 lightly and the lower side is open to the right
MR: I agree with your choice. Attaching at C3 only strengthens white, as he has enough space on the left edge, as C11 is rather far away.]
;W[ep];B[dq]C[MR: Why not F4? White would be weaker afterwards than in the variation in the game.]
;W[dp];B[fp];W[fo];B[gp];W[en];B[go]C[MR: The variation is, in my opinion, good for white. Black cannot hope to kill white!. And the black wall that you start to build around G5 does not help black, as white has stones around N5. 
I think that instead of D3 the "normal" attach joseki starting with F4 would have been better.]
;W[gn];B[hn]C[does this sequence just hurt me?];W[hm];B[gm]
;W[fn]C[Javaness [5k\]: back in a minute];B[in]C[Javaness [5k\]: sorry about that
itso [2k\]: np];W[hl];B[bd]SQ[cl][cq]C[mistake? - maybe one of these [\]?
MR: I think black has to defend around D8. C3 is big, but gote. As the lower black group is not in danger, it is rather a follow up to D8.]
;W[eg];B[nf]C[I guess this was wrong? but where is best?];W[qe]
C[czepiec [3k\]: java is doing very well !
czepiec [3k\]: actually, where is white's territory ?];B[pe]
;W[qd];B[pd];W[rc];B[pc]C[czepiec [3k\]: S18];W[rg];B[rb];W[rd]
C[how should i play now? I didn't know where to go here.
MR: I would play a pincer on the upper side. Maybe M17.];B[lc]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[jc]C[MR: Why not N17? K17 gives white the opportunity to split black into two groups.]
;W[kb];B[md]C[MR: I think that the ataris mainly help white.]
;W[le];B[mc];W[me];B[nc];W[jd];B[ke];W[ic];B[kf];W[ip];B[ho]
C[MR: H3 is better. You can also think about K4 or J3. With H5 in the game you are totally forced by white and the black group starts to look weak.]
;W[cq];B[lp];W[mp];B[jp]C[MR: What is your exact plan? Seperate the white stone at J4 from the other white stones? Then you should be sure that it works ...]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[kr];B[iq];W[hq];B[ir];W[hr];B[hp];W[is];B[io]
;W[jr];B[gr];W[jm];B[ip];W[lr];B[gq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[im]
;W[il];B[km];W[jl];B[hs];W[ck]C[MR: It feels that black was tricked in the fight with the black group on the lower side. The black shape looks horrible. And white gets stronger on the outside and can play the invasion on the left side. 
I think that the problem started with K4.];B[dj];W[dk];B[ek]
C[MR: Is black strong enough for this move? 
And: What should be blacks goals? Big points are the upper left corner at C17 and the lower right side that white can close with S8.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[dl]C[NTT [7k\]: hallo
MR: ?];W[el];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[em];B[fi];W[gj];B[pm]C[MR: What is the goal? Kill the lower white group? I think that black can only hope to prevent S8, but then R8 would probably be better.]
;W[om]C[NTT [7k\]: t is druk maar niemand zegt wat?];B[ol];W[ql]
;B[rm]C[NTT [7k\]: it s crowded but nobody says something?]
;W[nm];B[oj]C[Kuudee [15k\]: i just like to whach :)
NTT [7k\]: oke :) this game is between 2 dutch players :)
MR: ?];W[qj]C[Drimgere [5k\]: javaness is british >_>
Kuudee [15k\]: irish :)
NTT [7k\]: oh ^^ well he s always in the dutch windmill :)]
;B[oh]C[I think i am lost, now, i tried to split some potential white moyo, but i haven't got enough points.
MR: Yes, I indicated in some places that I could not see your strategy. See my comments there.]
;W[pi]C[NTT [7k\]: if he can tenuki
NTT [7k\]: that s the place];B[cj]C[MR: ? When you want to play in this area, you should read whether you can play B9. Maybe white can capture your stond at D10 and you get the left side edge as return?]
;W[bk];B[cd]C[Kuudee [15k\]: ?
MR: ? C17 is the correct point in this area.];W[dc];B[dg];W[oi]
C[Kuudee [15k\]: i would like prefer play to that c-17];B[nh]
C[MR: ? This move demonstrates ideally that the moves Q7, P8, P10 were bad.]
;W[ni];B[rl];W[rk];B[ln]C[NTT [7k\]: well this gives black a solid teritory at b 15
Kuudee [15k\]: true
NTT [7k\]: don t knpow what s worth more];W[mh];B[mg]C[NTT [7k\]: but c17 looks better to me ^^
Kuudee [15k\]: ^^];W[lb]C[MR: This move would have been sente for you most probably.]
;B[lh];W[mi];B[ml];W[nl];B[ef]C[Javaness [5k\]: thanks
itso [2k\]: thx for the game
itso [2k\]: I was thinking abuot O18
NTT [7k\]: nice games guys
itso [2k\]: well it seemed like a good game for black
itso [2k\]: but lat 30 moves it turned
Javaness [5k\]: i think i should have had C3 or D8 instead of B16

MR: I think that the game was decided by some strategic mistakes in the middle game. I indicated that in some places I did not at all find your strategy. I think that you should step back from the board more often and ask yourselve what goals you want to achieve next. You should ask yourselve which groups you want to chase (and if this is a realistic plan) and in which directions you want to build your walls. Maybe "The Great Joseki Debate" would be a good book for you, as it asks for the choice of joseki from the direction perspective.

In the "end game" there were some major tactical mistakes, like C10 and C16.
Maybe a tesuji book helps to find alternatives for C10 and H5 :-)

I hope you find at least some of my comments helpful.
