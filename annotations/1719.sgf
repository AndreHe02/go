C[*X*: As usual, my (reviewer's) comments prefixed by "*X*" for "Xopods," my IGS/KGS/DGS username

---

This is a game where I won several battles but still badly lost the war; I
think from the fuseki. I would appreciate your comments.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[dq];B[ce]C[*X*: See, this is what I told you to do last game.  Black knows where it's at.]
;W[jd]C[*X*: Good.  You remember that a response around here is urgent (actually, K17 is more usual, making miai of extending left or right to make a base, but this is playable, I think).]
;B[lc]C[*X*: I don't like this.  It's hard to attack a fourth line stone this early in the game, and this move doesn't do much for either territory or influence because of invasion points at O17 and R17.  I would prefer to take a big point (e.g. K3 or R10) or, more likely, kakari at C5 or D5 in the lower left.]
;W[gc]C[This carves me some space to live on the top, but leaves me with an easy
jump in above K16. I suspect it's a mistake.

---

*X*: Yes, this is bad, for the same reason that M17 is bad.  Fourth line stones are hard to attack, so they are meant to be treated lightly.  If settling quickly was what you wanted, K17 would have been better than K16.  Since you played K16, the correct way to play is to leave this stone alone for the time being.

If I was playing White here, I'd make a shimari at C5 now.  And that's what Black should have played (C5 kakari) instead of M17.]
;B[le];W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[*X*: Wrong (see variation)];W[qc]C[*X*: Right.]
(;B[qd]C[*X*: Hard to say which side Black should block on.  Either way makes him overconcentrated, which is why R12 was wrong and R17 right.

However, I would personally play Q17 instead of R16.];W[rd]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[od];W[nb]C[*X*: Without M17, O17 is the right move, instead of O18.  But with M17, this might be right.  I'm not sure.]
;B[oc]C[I believe this is a mistake by my opponent, using up aji

---

*X*: Yes.  Do not push into keima unless you can cut.  At the very least, this wastes a ko threat, and gains very little for Black.]
;W[ob];B[mc]C[*X*: Very slow by Black.  This isn't necessary (in fact, it just worsens Black's overconcentration) and White can now tenuki.  Locally, Q14 is more important for Black, to remove the aji of R14... but I would now tenuki as Black.  R6 looks good, and C5 is still desireable for both players.]
;W[kb]C[*X*: Slow.  C5 shimari or something on the right like R7 to prevent Black making a wide extension from his thickness.]
;B[lb]C[*X*: Bad shape, slow, unneccesary.  Both of you are adding too many moves to this area of the board.  It's no longer urgent.]

(;W[jb]C[now I think my group at the top is pretty secure

*X*: Yeah, but it could still have run out or lived without too much trouble, so I would have taken sente.  Locally, I think L17 is better than K18.]
;B[jq]C[*X*: Big point.  I still prefer R6 or C5 for Black though.]

(;W[dk]C[*X*: Hmm. I like C9 better.  If Black eventually extends from his shimari to C12, you're left with an open skirt.  Generally, if an opponent has nearby stones to extend from (especially third line stones like C15), it's adviseable to play low yourself.]
;B[ci]C[*X*: See? :-)];W[ck]C[*X*: Consider tewari analysis here.  If you had played C9 first, would you choose to play D9 in answer to C11, giving this result?  No.  You would have wanted to play C5, giving you good coordination with D3.  This shows clearly why D9 is bad.  Same problem with K16 on top, right?  If you're planning on making some territory or a quickly settled group somewhere, the third line is the place to play.  Fourth line stones are for influence and should usually be left alone until later.

See variation for the D9 move to see the shape I'm talking about.]
;B[co]C[*X*: This is probably too deep.  You should be able to get a good result here.  Maybe.  At the very least, you can probably link up and force Black to live in the corner while you build outward influence... however, that influence is reduced by the presence of K3.]

(;W[cp]C[*X*: Hmmm... if C9 and D9 were stronger, this would be good.  You're going to end up forcing Black to run out though, which will hurt them.  I would prefer a combination knight's move/capping move, aiming to link C9-D9 up with the corner and force Black to live small.  See variation.]
;B[do];W[fp];B[cm];W[bo]C[*X*: Bad, because it gives Black good shape and ends in gote for you.]
;B[bn];W[bp]C[*X*: You only strengthened Black, and gave away the initiative as well.]
;B[fn]C[*X*: Again, the relationship of Black K3 and White F4 leaves you with an open skirt, so the corner is not as big as it looks.  However, H3 is a checking extension for you... if you play there, it will force a response, as Black must extend to O3 (inviting invasion and threatening the corner) or N3 (stabilizing).  Still... you'll then have to do something in the lower right, so it isn't really sente.

Meanwhile, your two stones C9 and D9 are under serious attack, all because:

a) You played D9 instead of C9 to begin with, then played C9, making yourself heavy and letting Black play to attack you on the other side

and

b) B5 let Black become strong in sente so he can move out and attack your two stones at the same time.]

(;W[cg]C[probably this is a mistake; I was thinking the best defense is a strong
offense, but it didn't seem to work out. Looking at the board, I think I am
significantly behind.

---

*X*: Yes, you are.  And yes, this is a mistake.  That invasion is severe, but only later, once C9 and D9 are safe.  You attack WITH a weak group to make it stronger... attacking from the other side just gives you two weak groups.  There is a proverb "Don't create two weak groups."  It just begs for a splitting attack.  If you want to go for the "offensive defense," see the variation.]

(;B[ch]C[*X*: Bad by Black.  D12 the only move, IMHO.]
(;W[dg]C[*X*: Gotta treat this stone more lightly.  Jump to E13 probably better.]
;B[ei];W[bj];B[bh];W[bg]C[*X*: Bad.  Black G9, you're dead.]
