C[I played white in this game.   I generally have trouble playing white, since I feel behind and rush in whenever b looks good, as I did in this game.  There were several moves where I felt a bit lost -- "direction of play" comments and variations would be much appreciated.  Thanks for reviewing this for me.]

(;W[qn]TR[qe]C[CG: Cho Chikun played this joseki two times against a black san-ren-sei (having two 3-3 points on the upper side), but I would not like the moyo black gets at the bottom (and you were afraid of it, too). 

If you don't like the black moyo, don't play the second kakari and play another big point, e.g. Q17 or R9.

You should also take R15 into account. The purpose of the move is to build thickness - preferably to the right side. What is the value of this thickness after Black 13? 
The longer I think about the position, the more am I convinced that R6 is a bad move here.]
;B[ql]
(;W[qq]C[Maybe you should play P6 here - that would give R15 a purpose (see variation).]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[om];W[jq]C[Here I was just testing for a response.  My aim was to play a reducing move around k6/7 and get b to answer below, not above.  Was this a reasonable idea?  If so (or not), any better ideas for execution.  I was worried about b taking c2/r2 sente first and really hurting me....

CG: I think this is too deep. If you feel oblieged to enter the moyo, something went wrong before - you should not play R6 in this case. 

If you just wanted to reduce the moyo, why did you play here? There is no need to play a "probe" to prepare K7.]
;B[iq]
(;W[ip]C[CG: This is not what I would call a "probe" - it looks more like hamete.]
;B[ir]C[I would rather play H3 ...]
(;W[jr]C[This is an overplay. The variation is much better!]

[kp][hq][iq][jq][hr][ir][jr]C[Ouch! I think the position got better for black with the exchange of the marked stones - J4 turned out to be an aji-keshi.]
;W[ij]C[Good!];B[pc]C[So far I feel like b got a bit more out of the exchange, but I've still kept his bottom from becoming too big...

CG: Yes - but just J7 or K7 would have been better.];W[nd]TR[ql]
[om]C[CG: Do you really want to play taisha in this position?
I'm not an expert for 3-5 joseki, but I would prefer N17 or O17 in this case.]
;B[pe]
(;W[pf]C[CG: I do not know this move. O16 gets too weak if you induce P15 - this cannot be good.]
;B[oe];W[qd];B[oc];W[qi]TR[nd]C[I wanted to develop the top, but this seemed important.

CG: Yes, R11 is the right move now. But why did you play O16? This stone looks rather meaningless in this position.]
;B[ld]C[This may be too tight - L16 or maybe even F17 would have been even better.]
;W[jd]
(;B[hd]C[This feels, well, ambitious on b's part.  If you could show me a few alternative responses and the results after a few moves, that would help a lot.

My other thought was to  l15 or something to keep them separated?  I was worried about solidifying b while encouraging him to come out into the center, while still leaving the ul relatively open.

CG: I am not sure if this is an overplay or not - black is not weaker than white.]
;W[jf]C[Good - this _does_ keep black separated.];B[jc]C[CG: The connection only works on the 3rd row.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[kc]
(;B[jb];W[kd]C[Good.];B[ib]
(;W[gc]C[I think this is aji-keshi. Since you must go back to M15, black gets G18 and is satisfied.
Are you really afraid of F17? That would be a very bad (overconcentrated) move.]
;B[hc];W[le];B[gb]C[Good!];W[qc]C[This is a very big (and good!) move.]

(;B[mb];W[gf]
(;B[cc]LB[dm:A]TR[cl]C[Wrong direction for black?!
There is a cut at A ...];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[di]C[Good! Getting points in the center is your only chance.]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
(;W[ee]C[Yes, I should just defend the bottom to keep B11 away.  But I wanted to keep b from breaking in from the top...

CG: I think you must play at E15 or E16 - else the cut C15 is too dangerous.]
;B[bi];W[of]C[Good! This was blacks sente ...]
(;B[ne]C[Here we play -- "oh yeah, well if you tenuki I'm gonig to do this," for a few moves.  I felt that if B sealed the bottom while reducing my top the game was over.

CG: By answering black makes P14 a double sente - so he should have played here before playing B11.]
