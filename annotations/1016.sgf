C[LungChing: Hi
LungChing: Have a good game];B[po];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[jp]C[DRS: At all reasonable?  I"m hoping to turn this into a moyo game, because a need practice at playing moyos.

Comment: yeah,it works];W[jd];B[pf];W[dn];B[qp]LB[pq:A]C[DRS: How's this?  Somehow Q3 seems kind of too easy to invade.

Comment: A is the correct position];W[jj];B[ci];W[ck];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[qi]C[DRS: Too low?  I feel pressed low now that W has tengen.

Comment: The move is ok,because white already got the tengen,it is hard for black to expand.Black need to keep the territory in balance now.]
;W[ef];B[be]LB[ei:A]C[Comment: This is not a good move,black only make white stronger.Play at A is more usual.]
;W[bd];B[bj];W[bg];B[bf]C[DRS: Proper?

Comment: It's proper play to live,however,white will have a moyo if black only wants to live inside.]
;W[bk];B[bh];W[eh];B[fq];W[nc];B[od]LB[nd:A]C[Comment: Black needs to push white's moyo to minimum size,a move like A would be better,and it also help black's own moyo]
;W[me];B[kk];W[mh];B[nj];W[hq];B[iq]LB[jq:A][ho:B][cq:C]C[Comment: this move would be much better at A,because when white play,black can play C obviously.]
;W[hp]C[Comment: Black's moyo becomes weak all the sudden];B[cq]
C[DRS: Is there a corner sequence from here that will maintain sente, so I can go defend around K6?

Comment: It is hard to maintain the sente because black has to live]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er]LB[cr:A][eq:B][bo:C][fr:D]C[Comment: In this situation,this is the correct sequence.After this,black can play D at any time]
;B[br];W[ds];B[cr];W[eq];B[bn]C[DRS: Appropriate choice of joseki?  I was aiming for large damage to W's territory, but I didn't even think about keeping sente until the sequence was over.  Then I thought maybe the corner invasion was too small.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[kq];B[lq]LB[kp:A][jq:B]C[Comment: Black cannot just give up the two stones.Play at A or B sounds more reasonable]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[kp];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[mr];B[nr];W[jk];B[kl]
;W[im];B[kn];W[jn];B[ms];W[kr]C[Comment: Black lost alot over here]
;B[id]LB[gc:A][lc:B][lf:C]C[Comment: this seems like a suicide move.White is too thick all over,if black really has to play inside,black can consider A or B.Howver,making an exchange at C first might be helpful]
;W[ic];B[jc]C[DRS: Is this an appropriate crosscut?  I guess I don't really know when to crosscut and when not to.]
;W[hc];B[kc];W[kd];B[lc];W[mc];B[ld];W[oe];B[pe];W[le];B[nd]
;W[md];B[ne];W[mf];B[ob];W[nb];B[kj];W[ki];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[pg];B[qg];W[pj];B[pk];W[qh];B[rh];W[ph];B[ri]
C[DRS: Bad shape.  Would S10 have been better defense?

Comment: S10 is better.Howver,black is lossing about 30 point right now......]
;W[ni];B[oj];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[bm];B[cs];W[di]C[Comment: After this move is played,it is time for black to resign]
;B[cg];W[cj];B[aj];W[dh];B[ch]C[DRS: Clearly this is too small.  I should have gone for B17.  Is there anything even bigger than that?

Comment: B17 is the biggest now];W[jl];B[km];W[cp];B[bp];W[bc]
;B[es];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[ds];W[gr];B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[mg]

;B[an];W[ls]LB[ns:A][nq:B][or:C][pq:D][oq:E][np:F][mo:G][op:H]
[pr:I]C[What's the best way to handle this?  I was worried W would cut at O3 if I played O1.

Comment: O1 can result this sequence,Black seems fine to me.If black is still afraid,then just play at C]
;B[nq];W[ns];B[or];W[os];B[ps];W[ms];B[pr]C[Comment: Black didn't have a good strategy while playing a moyo game.A moyo game has many things need to beware,such as do not play too deep in opponent's moyo,try to shrink opponent's moyo as much as posible,don't bring bad effect to own moyo while inviading opponent's moyo,the sequence of expanding moyo has to be correct]
;C[LungChing: Thanks for the game])
