C[My coments will be preceded by DS:  I will also include a few variations when it seems important. However, I will say that my comments may be challanged by a stronger player, but I will try to help you see your weak points.


To the reviewer: first of all, thanks in advance for your comments.
It's a game I played against a computer and to my surprise I won, but I think it's very chaotic and not very good one.  My friend (13k) gave me this program lately and he said its strength is around 12 kyu and that he didn't manage to win against it. That's why I am so surprised because my friend is stronger than I am and I won by 13,5 points.
Of course, it's a computer and it makes stupid moves sometimes, but I make them too :) I hope you don't feel offended with commenting a game with a computer program.]
;B[qd];W[qp];B[op]C[DS: This is agressive. Standard to play in open corners first. This is not a bad move, just unusual.]
;W[cq];B[qo]C[DS: standard would still be to move upper left.  The 3-3 point by W really is only about territory, not about the rest of the board.  The proper direction of play would be in the upper left, which works well with the stone in the upper right.]
;W[ro];B[qn]C[DS: Standard move is Q5.  W then will play R6.]
;W[pp];B[dp]C[I guess this was too early, I should finish with the lower right corner first, am I right?

DS: Right.  Really D4 is unimportant move at this time.  Even C16 is bigger, but answering a contact move like Q4 is almost mandatory. P5 would be ok, i think.]
;W[oo]C[DS: W gets to cut B into two groups.  Bad for B.];B[po]
C[Empty triangle bad in this case?

DS: correct.  really bad move.  You can't really fight well this way.]
;W[on];B[np];W[rn];B[qm];W[ol];B[dd]C[DS: Difficult to abandon the fight in the lower right.  I would think that R9 is only move.]
;W[pr]C[DS: I think if W R9 B's group is dead.];B[ci]C[After making this move I felt it's a bit too far (?)

DS:  Distance is ok.  but more urgent to move at  P16 or even better to strengthen one of your two weak groups at the bottom right.]
;W[cp]
(;B[gc]C[DS: No.  Contact plays demand a response.  D5 is the only move here.  You should learn this simple joseki.  PRLV (Please review last variation)      W can still invade with ease at C17, so this move is loose.  Protecting the corner would be a move like E17, but bigger would be simply K16]
;W[do];B[co]C[DS:  no.  Too much fighting.  calm down here.  You are out numbered 3 - 2 here and cannot get a good result.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dn];W[bo];B[eo]C[DS: W is thick and B has lots of cutting points.  This is a bad result for B.  It might have been better to descend to B5 then let W get D4.  You would then capture the C6 stone and it would be an even exchange.  See the variation starting with B's descent to B5.]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[kp];B[mq];W[kq]C[DS: ???  M5 seems the only move before connecting.  M5 would make B heavy and eyeless.]
;B[or];W[lo]C[Now I thought myself: my group is dead here. Later it turned out that it's alive and that it is white lower-right group  which is dead, I've got no clue why. Probably white made some major mistakes?

DS:  I agree.  W should be ok here.  Even if W just played P3 there would be no problem.]
;B[gp]C[DS:  the only move here would be connecting at E6 or so  but anyway, B creates a heavy group.]
;W[od]C[DS:  Dumb computer. R9 better i think]
(;B[oc]C[DS:  Joseki move, but does not consider whole board. PRLV]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[pf];W[jc]C[DS: standard Joseki.  However, considering the upper left, this joseki is to W's advantage.  PRLV]
;B[qk]C[DS: Good move.  W should have played here long ago.]
;W[be]C[DS:  Again really dumb.  C17 the only move here.];B[bc]
;W[ck]C[DS:  This is the problem with playing computers.  They jump around without a plan or overall strategy.]
;B[bi]
(;W[cg]C[DS: I would think a light move like D14 would be better for W.]
;B[dg]C[DS: Be careful.  Contact plays generally make your opponent stronger!  IF W were to play lightly here, and give up a stone or two (B15, C13) then escape is no problem. The computer can't  "see" light moves and generally tries to save any group of move than a couple stones.]
;W[df];B[ef]
(;W[eg]C[DS:  I think D12 would have been better.];B[dh];W[ee]
;B[ff]
(;W[de]C[DS: W makes itself heavy and attackable.  A lighter move would be R15 sacrificing the other stones if necessary.]

;B[af]C[DS: you handle this well.  W loses a lot here.  It was a mistake to try to save the whole group.]

(;B[og]C[DS: umm, I think S12 is only move.  The ko at Q12 is too big for B to risk losing the whole right side group.]
;W[rh]C[DS: Huge move.];B[ph];W[di];B[ch];W[cj]C[DS: computers don't understand ko at all.  This is a ko threat.  Playing it now wastes it's potential (aji)]
;B[bj];W[cl]C[DS: not only that but Now B can and should have connected the ko at Q13. Never play a ko threat that makes you end in gote! (DUMB computers)  THis is not a sente move.  W has only 4 liberties to B's 5.  So B will win the capturing race.]

(;B[bd]C[DS: Not needed.  just connect the ko.];W[pg];B[pq]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[oq];B[ps]
(;W[nr]C[DS: Ditto.  That is why you won the corner. computers can't seem to determine whether a ko is advantageous or not.  These two kos are enormous.  W seems to have many more ko threats than B here, but loses the ko with a weak, local move.  I don't understand why W didn't just connect. This ko is too big. PRLV]
;B[pq];W[mr]C[DS: ??? Dumb computer.];B[nq];W[rr];B[ns];W[lr]

;B[rm];W[ms];B[sn];W[so];B[sm];W[kd];B[dq];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[hq];W[kh];B[ho]C[DS: B can easily jump to H6. This move is a little slow.  W is trying to make a moyo in the center.  B needs to be aware of that potential and try to reduce W's center. At this point in the game W has little territory other than the left lower corner. B is Way ahead in points now.  In a normal game, W probably would have resigned about now.]
;W[jj]C[DS: Too slow.  J6 seems more consistent with center moyo strategy.]
;B[dl]C[Now I see no reason for this move, do you see any?

DS:  I agree. small move.  Playing H8 seems better.];W[dm]
(;B[co]C[DS: this leads to disaster.  Just play solid at E6 .  B is so far ahead now that fighting will only lead to giving W chances to catch up.]

(;B[mg]C[DS: Bad move. Especially with the cut at P14.  Again, B is so far ahead just play solid calm moves now.  Remember to defend, not just attack all the time.]
;W[mi];B[ph];W[in]C[DS: W catching up now.];B[nh];W[pg];B[nb]
;W[mb];B[ph]C[DS: No, just connect at P18. remember, calm!]
;W[gr];B[hs];W[fr]C[I felt a little cold after this one. Eventually my group lived, but could white kill it somehow if it played better?    DS: I think B is alive.]
;B[cr];W[fq];B[er];W[br];B[ds];W[pg];B[mc]C[DS: No, just P18]
;W[ob];B[ph];W[pb];B[lb]
(;W[lc]C[DS: unbelievable. W should just capture O18. B's corner then is in jepardy.  PRLV]

C[DS: Small endgame move. Not even sente. B's possible moves include: O11, O5, G7 but even better may be J18 for B to make the best endgame moves.]

;B[jg];W[ld];B[qa];W[kb];B[oa];W[nb];B[jp];W[jd];B[pn];C[I have one more request to you. I am not really sure if my strength is 16 kyu or 20 kyu or some other, I've just played one game with my friend (13k) and I won by 1 point (I played black with no komi, so 1 handicap) and he said that I could be even 13 kyu. I don't think it is that good :), so I wrote 16 kyu here which I think is a "safe" assumption. If you could tell from my game if I am right or wrong, that would be very helpful...


DS:  I'm not good at evaluating one's strength, especially with veiwing only one game.  However, you seem to read ok, but need to play more solidly.  Your stones need to work together.  The secret to GO is that the player whose moves are more effiecient, generally wins.       Also remember, whether you win by 1 point or 50 points, it does not reflect on your "rating" level.  The best way is to play a series against a rated player and adjust the handicap until your win/loss record is 50%.  Then you can have a better idea what your relative rank is.

    Play moves with more than one purpose.  ie.  A pincer that is also an extension down the side.    To get a better feel for your level, play someone who has a rating on IGS or NNGS or such.  If you play a series of 3 - 5 games and lose 3 in a row, go down one handicap stone. However, ratings in the "teen" kyu's is highly variable, even against the same opponent.    Play more games against humans.  Playing computers can be fun, but is NOT a good way to learn GO.  It is a good way to learn bad and sloppy play.]
