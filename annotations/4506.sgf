(;B[cn]LB[qe:C][qf:D][op:B][oq:A]SQ[dp][qp]C[N: Strangely this pattern gives only five hits from professionnal games on gobase, all won by white! The reason might be the following alternatives:
- Peronally I would play at 'A' or 'B' instead of your move. If you looked at the four sides of the board, only the bottom was flanked with two cornerstones in a high position(fourth line), meaning that this was the most devellopable side. (for example q17 is low in the direction of the upper side, and c16 high)
- The two other frequent moves are C and D to make a shimari, wich also makes the topside more valuable again.

All this said, your move is ceartainly not bad, at least not that we amateurs could notice. I didn't want to make such a comment on such a normal move, if later there weren't more mistakes against direction of play.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[dq]C[N: this is a terrible mistake in the direction of play. Apparently white doesn't have a clue about this joseki.]
;B[cp];W[do]
(;B[dn]C[N: they say this is a move for special circumstances, but I don't know which. My advice would be: keep it simple, certainly if your opponent makes such a mistake of direction.]

;W[fn]
(;B[op]C[N: wrong];W[lp]C[N: this is an ideal extention for white. If you see that white can make such an excellent pincer, 'maybe' your previous move was not so good]

(;B[on];W[qn];B[ol];W[ql];B[pj];W[oq];B[pp]C[R: Here I understand that Q3 would be better... I don't know why I chose Q4.

N: maybe you played too quickly? It is really a terrible move.]
;W[pq]TR[qp]C[N: hane at the head of two stones, and white has a nice corner. On purpose, this shape happens only under certain circumstances, ex. the avelache joseki.]

(;W[df]C[N: horrible move];B[ce]C[N: good, vital point.];W[ef]

(;B[jo]C[R: I decided to invade before my opponent builds up this moyo completely (a usual result in our games...). Any better suggestion?

N: A reduction is a good move, however your move looks a bit deep, it is difficult to predict the result of the battle if white doesn't answer submissively. So one line higher looks more prudent]

(;W[ip]C[N: what you hoped for];B[lo];W[jp];B[io];W[hp]TR[ip]
[jp]C[N: this is a great result for black. The marked stones are played submissively. Black has sente moves against the bottom, so it really is not big at all.]

(;B[jj]TR[jc][pc]C[N: what you need to keep in mind now is that the low position of the marked stones will make it harder for you to construct a moyo.]
;W[je]C[R: Now I was confused, and wasn't sure what to defend first.

N: hmm, this shouldn't be a reason to be confused. Your biggest growing potential is on the upper right, so you need to defend that side.]

(;B[hd]C[N: so not like this.]
(;W[jh];B[hf]C[R: This is probably a mistake. Playing around M16 would be better?

N: i wouldn't go as far as saying that this was a completely won game. You had several opportunities to take the lead, but missed many too. Overall the two players looked equall.
If i can give you one advice from this game, it would be to always pay close attention at wich areas of the board can be developped, as well by you as by your opponent, and play accordingly. If an area can be developped by you as by your opponent, obviously this is a big place to play.
This way your game could improve a lot i think.
Also the josekimistake in the lower left is very important, and you should punish it in the future.

good luck,
