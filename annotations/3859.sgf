AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, it's the first time for me to give handicap stones - I would be thankful for every kind of help.

I put my questions as comments into the file.

Thanks a lot for your help.


P.S.: All the time I suffered from to much cutting points - how to prevent them?


Hi, I am David, I am your reviewer. My handle is Xif on KGS,IGS and Oro Baduck, feel free to email me or contact me.  To answer you PS first is your approach to cutting points; you don't have them you leave them. Cutting points are from lack of solid play, this isn't a bad thing. Its the choce to be flexable over having thickness.]
;W[dd];B[mc]
(;W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[D: This is a good idea although I prefer A becuase it is easier to make a base that way when black attacks]
;B[pg];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[qo];B[qp];W[jq]C[D:This the wrong time to play elsewhere becuase of the varation]

(;B[gq];W[mq];B[nq];W[nr]C[Is it right to defend territory or would it be better to move towards the center?

D: I wouldn't say its a bad move but I prefer just to play up on N4]
;B[oq];W[np]C[D: This move is bad I creates anotehr cutting point and doens't accomplish that much. If you want that direction you can play at N4 but as of now you have to way to much bad potential in lthe lower right side]
;B[or];W[mr];B[jo]C[D: This is a little to slow right now when you can approach the upper left corner.]

(;W[kp]C[D: This is the wrong direction I belive];B[jp];W[ko]
;B[iq];W[jr];B[ir];W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[qr];W[op]C[D:This move is bad, black doesn't need to respond]

(;B[pq];W[rp]C[I think it is a gote move - I make this kind of moves to often and lose the initiative

D:It is, you need to play more on the the bigger picture these moves are considered endgame and with the cutting point at R7 this is really unplayable]
;B[rq];W[so]
(;B[kn];W[ln];B[km]C[Now i have a very small territory around M3 but black has a lot of influence towards the center and the left side - how could I habe prevented this?

D: Well getting gote was part of the problem and playing the wrong direction didn't help. Black did effectivly use its opening stones.]

It looks like you can live but not without sacking some side terrirtory although at my strength I would say this is beyond my ability to answer for sure but I would say you went the wrong direction with  D3]

Your attack is good for you level although I would read through your cutting points and double check to see if the cut is brutal. If you want to ask me any questions don't hesitate to bug me.]
