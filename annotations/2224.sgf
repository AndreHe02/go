AB[pd][dp]C[I think in general I had stronger whole board strategy, and B had stronger fighting technique whcih took this edge off.

The 2 stone handicap just came because my opponent misunderstood the ranks, although it ended up pretty tight!

I need hints in just playing more economical moves i think - im sure its close quarters fighting thats runing my game! my opponent kept seeming to come out with genius moves i just didn't spot.

Thanks!];W[dd];B[pp];W[qc]LB[nc:D][jd:C][qf:E][dj:B][pj:F][cn:A]
[qn:G][jp:I][fq:J][nq:H]C[This moves is too early. Other (better moves are shown)

Why is R17 bad?
If B will protect the corner he will create a wall exterting influence on one of the sides. + he has D4 and Q4 stones.

you will end up with 1 corner (B can't kill) + 1 stone at D16.

This setup is very bad for W]

Well, you are fighting a fight you can't win due to all the cuts, take a look at variations for better way to make terr.

remember you should not fight just to fight. if you are fighting you should assess whether you can kill a big group (you can't here) or make solid terr (you are not doing that here) or make your opponent uncomfortable (kind of sort of, but not really)]
