;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn];W[de];B[cg];W[cf]C[kilroy [6k\]: this is not joseki, is there a better way to counter than what i did?

Jay: Your response is fine. This contact move is usually attacking move.  But, W starts to attack the wrong stone. It only makes it stronger.]
;B[dg];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[fc];W[fe];B[dk]C[kilroy [6k\]: is this move bigger than the one jump extension at the top (H17)

Jay: This is fine.  This makes a strong group to prepare attacking the W's UL weak group.]

(;W[gq]C[Jay: W has no time for this move.];B[hd]C[Jay: Now W is squeezed.]

(;B[bg]C[Jay: Slow move for B.];W[bb];B[db];W[ba]C[Jay: Letting W settle is too easy for W.  B lost an opportunity. Now the game is back to even pace.]

;B[rk];W[qi]C[kilroy [6k\]: how would you respond to this move?

Jay: What you did was fine. Attacking these two lonely stones is a good way to get ahead.]
;B[qg]
(;W[nk]C[kilroy [6k\]: and how about this one, i didn't see much for be by jumping out, but maybe that is a mistake

Jay: This is a slack move.  The three stones form a poor shape.]

(;B[rm]C[Jay: A mistake by B. See variation.];W[pn];B[po];W[pm]
;B[qo];W[oo]C[kilroy [6k\]: because now he has a wall and a likely center]

(;B[iq]C[kilroy [6k\]: better choice of invasion? after the invasion is over I feel like i have the short end of the stick

Jay: Yes, B is struggling. This is not a good invasion point.  It's more like an desperate attacking move.  One may not need to invade this deep now. Be cool headed and play a big point.]

;W[hl];B[kk]C[kilroy [6k\]: better reduction possible? where did i go wrong in the fight

Jay: W played very safe up to here, may be a little too soft.]
;W[kl]C[Jay: W is too conservative now.]
(;B[ll]C[Jay: B is fighting impulsively.];W[lk];B[jl];W[km]
;B[ml]C[kilroy [6k\]: I wanted to use the aji provied by J3 and P6 for something but i couldn't find anything

Jay: I wouldn't fight too hard here.  The top moyo looks promising.  You need a lot of patience here.]

;W[fm];B[fl];W[li];B[fk]C[kilroy [6k\]: from here on it's bad reading so you don't really need to review the rest of the game

Jay: Insisting on fighting produces no results here. This latter sequence is rather impulsive for B, insisting on destroying W's bottom.  It might work if the opponent is weaker, but with equal strength, it is not advisable.  No more comment beyond this point.]

(;B[ne]C[Jay: Let's say that B made this big move.  Let's count the territory for each side. 

B: UR,25pts+Top, 10pts+Left, 15 pts+LL, 7pts. + right 5 pts. = 63pts+moyo on the top. 

W: UL 8 pts., +Bottom, 46+sente, pts.+ komi, 6pts.=66pts. 

I am sure that B's top moyo is worth more than 3 pts. Thus, it is still a closely tied game. There is no need to be impulsive. Now, the urgency is to build the center.]
