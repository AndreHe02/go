AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[jantiff:

Dear reviewer, hello !

I am White in this 5-stone game, played on Dragon Go Server.

My style emphasizes thickness and attack. This Black, a friend of mine is very keen on territory, with a steady style and often sharp tactics.

This being a slow game (30 days per player) made it a real challenge to my usual style, and as you'll see I failed to overcome his steady play.

So I wonder, what went wrong ? What are the flaws in my play - technique, direction, timing ? How to play effectively against such a steady style ?

Thank you very much for your time, patience and insight.]PL[W]

(;W[dm];B[fp]SQ[jq]C[jantiff: this exchange seems too good for Black.



In which case you might have considered playing F3 instead.  You get attacked, but since it's a 5-stone game, you're 5 stones better at defending than he is.

One of the reasons to invade an area is at the last possible moment before one more move by the opponent will make it uninvadable.

The most common example of this technique is the timing of 3-3 invasions.]

(;W[gc]C[jantiff: probably wrong direction.];B[cf]LB[lc:A][rd:B]

(;W[lc];B[rd]C[jantiff: again the exchange is good for Black, White is thin on both sides.]
;W[ph]LB[qn:A]C[jantiff: real slow isn't it ? Black has not yet checked around A.




Yes, in a high handicap game as white i want a faster development.]
;B[cj]C[jantiff: now Black seized the initiative, nice pincer... In the sequence following I passively set to settle the stone, making poor shape and pushing from behind. Any alternative ?]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[do];B[dq];W[bo]C[i like C5 better for white due to the raw spot at C6 .]
;B[eo];W[en]TR[ch][cn]C[jantiff: aiming at the invasion, but actually helping Black's framework and leaving a double peep that later cost me dear.]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[gn];W[mp]C[jantiff: gently erasing.


i like o3 better];B[qn];W[jo]C[
looks better for w to play q3 than k5];B[hp];W[ch];B[ej];W[eh]
C[
since b can connect under with b12, how about w d11 instead of e11.  if b connects then w runs with f12 next.]
;B[gj];W[gh]C[
g12 doesn't do much.];B[gm]C[jantiff: I get badly shut in, Black's group is safe.]
;W[fl];B[db]C[jantiff: good timing from Black isn't it ?



too bad w didn't play c17 invasion earlier.];W[nb];B[ob];W[nd]
C[
i like w n18 better];B[oc]C[

seems like black could have done atari at n8];W[pq]C[jantiff: to limit the last corner. Black is thick all over the board. I'm not happy without a target.]

black was too nice to white, letting white connect all his stones together.]

white was already connected here, so it seems to be a black loss to give up these two stones.]

seems unnecessary because black already only has one eye here.]

yes, white should have at least tried to limit black to only one eye.]
