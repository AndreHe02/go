C[Druft [-\]: hello
Druft [-\]: have a nice game
AndreyL [2k\]: hey have fun];B[pd]C[thanks for reviewing my game
I played against 1d-1k lvl player and my biggest problem was his moyo.
in the middle of the game i made really bad mistake but i felt behind even before.
in the end i tryed to kill his group and failed.
i feel i missed the key moves near his moyo];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[eq];B[lp]C[i wasnt sure here
f4 looked bad so i decided to jump to m4

f4 isn't bad, it gives the invasion to the corner although  that way j4 becomes alittle close. but giveing him f4 in sente at some point is bad, which is why u need to play f4.]

looks like his wall taking potential of m4 stone

m4 stone lost potential when u played underneath white ;p.

R8 is slow, i undertsand no one wnast to let somone hane to a stone like that but in the opening but id prolly play r 13 instead of this stone if he hane again 2 space jump form top.]
;W[nc]C[bad move]
(;B[pf]C[Cant play here, wrong direction.];W[jd]C[w has alot of the big points now but q8 is still huge but less so now because q14 is over thick, c14 prolly my move.]
;B[pl];W[nm]
(;B[cf];W[ch]LB[cc:A][ef:B][fd:C][fc:D]C[i felt corner is bigger but now i am not so sure.
maybe jumping out works better here

Jumping in is very brave, but also alittle foolish most variations give w a wall towards his thickness makeing the top very large and deystroying ur right side. also the attack on p3 gorup will become more difficult.

C and d are also good options here, i wont bother playing them out, but if ud liek to see them grab any dictionary, i reccomend kogos joseki dictionary, just google it.]
