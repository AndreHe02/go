AB[pd][dp]C[samtregar:
I played this game as black with 2 handicap stones.  I felt like I played
well and can spot few mistakes in my play.  When the final score came in
I was surprised to see that I'd lost by 9.5 points!  I've added some comments
and questions to the game, prefixed by "samtregar:".  I'm hoping you can
point out problems in my game that will help me improve.

samtregar:
jollyroger is also interested in seeing the review, so if you have any comments
for white please feel free to add them.

Interesting game, hope to be useful
to you and jollyroger.
I noticed you play on KGS so if you need
more help you can find me there, nick "Michele"

(;B[qo]C[* it is ok but for my taste i would have played Var2]
;W[op];B[ql]LB[pl:B][pm:A]C[samtregar:
Maybe A would have been better?  I also consider B but figured I would just
get into trouble by creating bad aji.

* I think it is ok.];W[kq];B[dd]C[samtregar: I felt good about this trade.]
;W[qp]C[samtregar: I think this is small for the openning, so I ignored it and took a big point.

* Playable by white, black tenuki is also ok];B[jc]C[* i prefer d10-side for black.. white is strong in the lower part of the goban.]
;W[dj];B[cl];W[be]C[* This move seems a bit slack, new to me also]
;B[df]LB[bc:A][fd:B]C[samtregar:
White's last move confused me and I didn't know how best to respond.  I considered
A and B.  Looking back, they both look better than the move I chose.

* You answered well];W[cc];B[dc];W[cg]
(;B[ge]C[samtregar: trying for territory, which I did get in the end...

* you should think bigger.. see var];W[re]C[samtregar: another unexpected move.  White is using the second line in ways I've never seen before.]

C[samtregar: at this point I thought I had the upper right under control and decided to enlarge my framework on the right

* P17 for black make the right part of the mojo "real" but it is
not too big now to be played (perhaps 15 points)];B[pi]C[* this is a good move
white is alive but closed in the corner.

I do not think white as obtained something good with his two
strange moves, perhaps he tried to trick black but samtregar answered quite well.
Kakari on the second line may be used in high handicaps games and not in the fuseki
but in the middle game, in my opinion.];W[pn];B[qn];W[po]
(;B[pm]C[* see var2];W[fq]
(;B[hp]LB[jp:B][hq:A]C[samtregar:
I thought this would be a good reducing move.  I was afraid he would get
a huge area on the bottom.  Well, I was right!  Maybe A would have been more
successful?  Or B?

* I do not like to invade for black is going to weaken himself on the left, but perhaps i am not a good fighter :)
See var2 please];W[hq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[gq];B[ip];W[iq];B[eq]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[er];B[dr]C[samtregar: misread this one!
* this is a "trick" to invade the corner];W[dq];B[ep];W[cr]
C[* you have accomplished in some ways to stop white making a big mojo.]
;B[bq]C[samtregar: much too small

* really , ! :) if you remove small moves from your game
you can improve your play greatly.];W[fi];B[ek]C[* e9 is not really dangerous now, white could reduce black with K15]
;W[ej];B[fk];W[br]C[bad move for white,small];B[ap]C[samtregar: again, I should have ignored this and played a bigger move

* yes :)];W[pk];B[qk]LB[ok:A]C[samtregar: I strongly considered A, but decided to play it safe

* good!];W[nk]
(;B[in]C[* i prefer var2];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn]C[* you are helping white building territory and solidifying it

;B[ml];W[nl];B[nm];W[nn];B[om];W[lj];B[mk];W[mj]
(;B[nj]C[* O10 is not so good, cutting to get 3 stones, because it is better attacking the white group while making points in O13-zone

See var2 for example];W[kk];B[ll];W[ni];B[oj];W[ki];B[jk];W[ii]
;B[jj];W[ji];B[kj];W[je]C[samtregar: this was a big move.  If I had played there I might have won, I think.

* Yes crucial point, but the game is still open]
(;B[if]C[* This try to capture the reducing stones
but it is too difficoult

losing by 9.5 points show that you was ahead, considering white's
better endgame.];B[id]C[* better later than never :)];W[mc]

;B[tt];W[fl];B[el];C[samtregar:
Game over, white wins by 9.5.  It still amazes me how few mistakes I found
in my playing.  Aside from a couple bad reads and small plays, I don't know
what went wrong.  Thank you for helping me find out.

* You suffered expecially the better endgame played by white
you find out yourself answering most of the time his attack (endgame), this is not good
try always to find an alternate big move to counterattack.
The middle game was quite nice, you should have valorized
better the upper influence , see variations,
For sure you lost in the endgame, but from what i have seen you are not so far from jollyroger level.
I hope to have helped you with my comments (biggest error where noticed by yourself) but remember i
am not a strong player so you may find something wrong in my analysis
Sorry for my poor english.
Cu on Kgs, tell me there if something is not clear!
