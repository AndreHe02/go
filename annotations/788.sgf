GC[Hi! This is my first game request to review. I am a go newbie, playing for about 3 month, and will appreciate comments from any player!]


;B[pd]C[My name is Sharon Fridman (Fridy).

I played black in this game, and lost... (the smallest lose and
also the biggest disappointment :-)

I'm a newbie, playing for about ~3M and enjoying a lot !



Thanks for whoever will review this game.     I inserted comments in some places I had some thoughts, but by
all means please do not restrict your comments to those moves,
as I probably had mistaken few moves before (and after...).



A general comment: a 5D player advices me to play rather quickly
and  a lot of games, and review them - and plan / think a lot/
count / learn game sequences - joseki only when I approach higher
kyus. What is your opinion?

shusaku : That's true. When you're in low kyu, you should study
all fundamental knowledge of the game such as, Tesuji, Life&Death
problems and play lots of games. These will help you read the
positions and make good shapes. Afterward, you will have to study
about the openning and joseki. But in your level I'll recommend
studying Tesuji and L&D problems (lots
of them) because in this level not many people know much about
opening, everything decided in middle game fighting.     Thanks again!]

I felt it may be so - and now I had the time.

I also felt is it far enough from the white wall below, and I'll
be able to connect right.

However, is there an urgent move in priority?

Is there other important location ?

shusaku: Play at A would be bigger since W moyo wasn't solid.
B can play at X marked to reduce W moyo anytime.];W[ep]
(;B[eq]LB[ej:A]C[E3 or san-san C3 now?

Have I helped W in stabilizing the lower left corner before I
approached D4 group with C6?

shusaku: If you really like to play in that area, just play at
D2. In this case that area wasn't important. How about neutral
W moyo at A (see variation).

It wasn't a good idea to play around C6 at all since W  was very
strong, remember 'don't play too close to the thickness'.];W[dq]

I save the c6 group (see following moves)?
