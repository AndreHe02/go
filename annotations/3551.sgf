AB[pd][dp]C[Hi! I'm 24-25 kyu. I play go from few weeks. I want somedoby stronger to review my game. I played white. I know i made few mistakes, but probably i made more ;) Thx!


Ps. sorry for my english grammar ;)

Hi! I'm about 10 kyu ; if you have any more question about this game, please feel free to ask me by email. I also hang around on KGS sometimes, as 'linfir', or 'silk'.

I hope this review will help you.];W[pp];B[cd]C[skalpel [23k\]: hi]
;W[qf];B[np];W[pn];B[nn];W[pj];B[md];W[oh]LB[of:A][qj:B]C[I wanted to avoid black cut off my stone at R14.  I'm not sure if it was a good move.

It looks strange ; A is probably what you were looking for. Or you could play at B, also preventing the cut and securing the right side.]
;B[re]LB[ec:A][cn:B][fq:C]C[
--
I think this is much too early to play this move, which is nothing but big yose (endgame). White should tenuki and play something like A, B or C next.]
;W[rf];B[qe]C[
-- 
Compare with the situation a few moves back : black made quite a lot of profit]
;W[of]C[
-- 
Useless ; there was no need to defend here, and this doesn't really expand white's territory/moyo.]
;B[jp]C[
-- 
Good.];W[cj]LB[ec:A][ed:B][cn:C]C[
-- 
Too slack. White should play at A or B ; and if black answers, there should be time to play at C later.]
;B[ch];W[cn]LB[cm:A]C[
-- 
The two space extension at A is safer. Or maybe you thought about the continuation black C8 - white F3 ? It is quite complicated...]
;B[co];W[bn]LB[dn:A]C[
-- 
A would be better, because now if black plays at A, he will clearly dominate the lower side.]
;B[bo];W[dl]LB[en:A]C[--
The shape is not very good. Maybe A would be better ; tenuki (playing elsewhere) is probably okay too.]
;B[go];W[ec]C[-- 
Finally.];B[dc]
(;W[hc]LB[ed:A]C[--
It is possible, but maybe a bit too passive ; I like A better ; see variation for a possible continuation.]

(;B[kc];W[jc]LB[ed:A][ee:B][he:C]C[-- 
Not good - why play a contact move ? 
A is still better. B or C are also possible.];B[jb];W[jd];B[kd]
;W[ed];B[eb];W[fb]LB[ce:A][ch:B]C[-- 
A is better, because you can aim to cut off the stone at B, like in the previous variation.]
;B[cb]C[-- 
And now it's too late.];W[jf];B[pl];W[ql]LB[om:A]C[-- 
I'd play A first : here black will cut white, but you can cut black too.]

--
Here, black missed something big. See variation];W[pm];B[ol]
;W[rk]LB[rk:B][qm:A]C[-- 
It seems okay, but you need to check that black A is harmless.

Playing at A instead of B leaves less aji.];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq]
;W[fq]C[-- 
Why not ? It is quite complicated, but I think white can live.

I won't comment much on this because there are simply too many variations, and I'm not certain about them...]
;B[gq];W[dq];B[fp];W[eq]C[-- 
It looks a bit strange to me, but it seems to work, so I guess that's a good move !]

LB[cf:B][df:A][qr:C]TR[kh][lh][ki][li]C[-- 
What is this move about ? 

Do you want to make some points around the triangled area ? I don't think there are much point here, because it's fairly open in the bottom.

Or is it just to connect your groups ? The top group is already quite safe.


Now, the game is almost in big yose - I mean, the territory are quite delimited. Counting secure territory, I'd say black lead by maybe 10 points. So, I see a few options :

- play white A, black B and try to make more points than black in the center.

- try something fishy in the upper right corner (but I don't really see this working)

- start yose right now : C is *huge*, that is maybe 25 points for both sides !]
;B[hb]C[-- 
This is too small.];W[gb];B[ic];W[id];B[ib];W[he];B[df];W[ef]
;B[de];W[eh]C[-- 
Here, black has been exceptionnaly kind, letting himself being shut in. White now has a good chance to make profit in the center.]
;B[dh];W[ej]C[I'm not sure if D11 wouldn't be a little better move to play...

-- 
You're right, it would be more solid.];B[fm];W[dg]LB[hk:A]SQ[ch]
[dh]C[-- 
Too small ! What is bigger, in your opinion:  the center (with a move like A), or the two black marked stones ?]
;B[cg];W[eg];B[kl];W[jj];B[hl];W[hk]LB[hj:A]C[-- 
Why do you play a contact move ? Better to stay at distance, with something like A.]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii];B[jk];W[kj];B[nj]LB[qr:A]C[-- 
You don't need to answer this move. Ask yourself : how much damage can he make if I don't answer ? Here, maybe 5 points ? Hence, better play elsewhere. A is probably the biggest move.]

Yes.];B[ke];W[ie];B[gm];W[fl];B[mf];W[mg]LB[se:C][bi:B][qr:A]
C[maybe M14 to reduce black territory?

-- 
You mean M15 maybe? Well, this is only worth a few points.

You should play sente moves first (or really big gotes moves).

-- 
Well, this is not an "attack" - this is merely yose...
But yes, C14 did not work now, so you should not have played it. And in a few moves, if black doesn't see it coming and doesn't defend (sweet dream), you can punish his carelessness.

There are many technical mistakes, but this is not really a problem - this area will improve naturally as you play more games.

I think your (and your opponent's) biggest problem is that you play small moves too early. 

So, in your next games, try to count (or rather roughly estimate) how much a move is worth, and how much effect it has.
This way, if your opponent plays a small move, you can confidently ignore him - yes, I know this is difficult...

Well, that's about it.

White has to protect because if black S4 he threaten to either connect or capture the two white stones.
