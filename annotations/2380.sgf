C[This is a game played between me and Tome in KGS with 6.5 komi. There was no timelimit. I am a 14 kyu in Finland.

The reason I am requesting a review for this game is that I am seeking the mistakes I do in planning out my moves and deciding the direction of the play. I would feel very welcome if You would show in your review the way a higher-level player thinks.

I have included in the sgf comments showing the mistakes I understand I have done and questions regarding suspicious parts in the game.

Thank you in advance for taking on this review request.

/Y
Hi, my name is Yannick and I am currently 6k on KGS. I'll do my best to provide useful comments, but I'm not really an expert.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec]C[I was considering ni-ren-sei but I thought playing something more rare would have better chance of producing a good result(I'm trying to shake off this way of thinking).

the reason I prefer ni-ren-sei start is because I feel it is symmetric and thus I cannot make a mistake playing it against almost any opponent fuseki(I know this is bad thinking too, but I have no choice as I understand very little of the early game)

/Y
The 5-3 point (mokuhazushi) empasizes influence. I think playing an unusual move can lead to a better result if you're better at reading than the opponent. Anyway it never hurts to experiment a rare move, since it is an opportunity to learn.

It's true that the ni-ren-sei is symetric, but you should rather see it as a quick and flexible way to build influence.]
;B[de]C[/Y
This move indicates that Black is ready to suffer a loss locally, by letting the corner territory to W. This way of playing prevents W from building influence with the mokuhazushi stone.]
;W[dg]C[/Y
Now W insists on getting the outside. It's not joseki, but it seems ok to me since there is a good relationship between D13 and D4.]
;B[dc]C[I feel this is very good for white.

/Y
B is settling his stones in the corner. The attachment is a common technique for this. If W can seal B in the corner it will be very good indeed.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ed];B[db]C[Is placing the E18 stone a "proper" move or was I right continuing the attack on the other side?

/Y
There is no need for E18 yet. However it seems to me that D18 is an overplay. What happens if W cut at C17 ? (see variations). B should have connected at C18.]

(;W[cf];B[ce];W[ef];B[qn];W[qf]LB[nc:D][qf:C][qi:A][ql:B]C[I was very lost in placing this move... I thought about placing it on the side to either K4/K3 or around top side star point and giving up sente back to black but decided against it.

What principles I should apply when presented with a position like this? After a black enclosure should I rush to remove the possibility of forming a double wing or just reply his side extension with mine on the other side later?

/Y
Here you can separate the Black enclosure from the Q16 stone by playing A for instance. It is better than R14 because it cannot be attacked so easily (if black plays B, white can extend to C, and if black C, white extends to B). Playing A leads to a small scale game with a tight score (usually).

Alternatively, you can develop the D4 stone by playing at K3/K4. This is good because this move would limit the development of the black enclosure as well.

Finally if you want to approach the Q16 stone, playing at D is better than C, because of the W stones on the top left.]
;B[qh]C[/Y 
Now B gets an ideal pincer that works also as an extension from his enclosure.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[nc];B[pb];W[qd]LB[qc:B][rd:C][ne:A]C[Should I have connected the O17 stone to the weak group to create a nice wall or is there a way to live in the corner(probably is)?

/Y
Yes playing A is a good idea, since it seals the corner while turning the top into a W moyo.

Attacking the corner is another possibilty, but I'm not really sure how. Maybe B or C.]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[og];B[qc];W[ph];B[qi];W[rg]
;B[rd];W[oc];B[rf];W[pc]C[This was to prevent black the possibility to cut my remaining stones in half. Best use I could imagine to the lost stones..

/Y
Actually, this result is good for W, since the top is now a W moyo, while B has crawled on the third line in front of his enclosure.]
;B[rb];W[be]C[A sente exchange I felt would kill blacks corner if ignored.

/Y 
ok];B[bd];W[bf];B[bb];W[jq]C[This or invasion to R9? I quess invasion since by looking at the ended game black had the whole side as territory.

/Y 
This is good. The invasion would be reckless. It would be useless anyway because the territory black has on the right side is small.]
;B[lq];W[gq]LB[jo:A]C[Any comments about this response?

/Y
This move is submissive. It is solid but it has no potential for further development. A more positive alternative would be at K5.]

;B[eo];W[bq];B[br];W[bo];B[aq];W[bp];B[bn];W[ap];B[ar];W[cr]
;B[dr];W[cs];B[do];W[es];B[el];W[dm]C[I should've strengthened the c8 stone first : / now it's wasted aji.]
;B[en];W[dj];B[em];W[jd]LB[oj:B][jo:A]C[Should I have reduced the nasty large corner or invaded instead? Again what are the principles to be considered here, make a moyo although black has a bigger one or invade and possibly let black place the big topside star point stone first?

/Y 
I'm not sure about this move. It may not be a good idea to try to make territory at the top because the left side is open (B can jump to F18). Also there is a weakness at E15 (what if B pushes and cuts ? see var)

Maybe A is better, since it threatens both the eyeless B group on the left and to reduce the B corner.

B is another big point, at the boundary of the moyos.]
(;B[ko];W[nn]LB[oj:A]C[Comments? too far in? too far out? I felt that R9 invasion would be too difficult to get through this late. If I had invaded black would have had a wall from R6 to O6 most likely and such almost 100%sure large corner.

/Y
It's seems too far in to me. A is better in my sense (boundary of two moyos side-by-side).]
;B[nj]C[/Y 
now the route of escape of the O6 stone is closed.]
(;W[nh]C[Bad, unthought move >_<
Should have placed Q11.

/Y
Q11 is not better since B still closes the way (see var).];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[kp]C[I was not sure what this move would help(I quess it did later on) but I played anyway as black ignoring it would be quite big. Possibly a thank-you-move.

/Y 
I think this is a thank you move, since W did not cut anyway.]
;B[lp];W[ln]C[If you have any comments about the techniques(right or wrong) or direction of play  used in the following escaping phase it would be great to hear them]

/Y

Is it normal to play like this or do I need to tone my aggressiveness and desire to kill down abit?



/Y 
The problem is that when B plays at A, the three W stones are captured (normally, see var). However the result is ok for W, since the invasion was successful.]

I have not much idea how this new, more fighting than moyo-based style(comparing to the previous style of mine) should be played out. Any general comments will be welcome.

/Y
Fighting can occur in moyo-oriented games, it all depends on the way the opponent deals with it (invasion or reduction). In this game you did well because you used the influence you created to attack the large group on the left. Unfortunatelly it didn't work out because of a small reading mistake. You should see this game as very encouraging for your future progress !]
