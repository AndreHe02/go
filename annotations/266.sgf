;B[pr];W[qp]C[This is not the joseki move. Joseki is R5 with the continuation at S8.]
;B[mp]C[i];W[qr];B[nn]C[This is a bit strange and seems to be the wrong direction. The natural move is a kakari at F3. White can still separate the groups by playing at P7, so the last black move has no real meaning.]
;W[no]C[White is unnecessarily looking for trouble. The cutting stone becomes very weak, and white just helps black in shutting him in.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[nm];W[ln];B[kp];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[jq];W[hp]
;B[io];W[jn];B[in]C[Wrong direction? I would rather play at M8. Just pushing white does not help you getting territory, while M8 aims at building a moyo with O16.]
;W[kl];B[cc]C[Tenuki is strange. Your stones on the right look very weak now, even weaker than whites stones in the center.]
;W[pj]C[Good.];B[nk];W[il]C[I would have played an extension (R13 or R14) on the right side.]
;B[gn]C[Not urgent. Black should play a pincer on the right side around R13.]
;W[gl];B[jm];W[km];B[jl];W[jo]C[This move is not necessarily sente, so you should just play K9.]
;B[jp];W[jk];B[im];W[lk];B[ni];W[hl]C[Definitely not the important place to move. Blacks bottom group is already alive, so white should play on the right side. The stone at J8 is affordable, the stone at Q10 not.]
;B[ph]C[Now I would prefer playing black.];W[ql];B[qk]C[Usually, the hane on the other side is correct. I hope you read the following sequence carefully before you decided to play this hane ...]

;B[lp];W[fn]C[Wrong direction.];B[go];W[fq];B[fo]C[This just helps white.]
;W[en];B[jr]C[Not necessary since you can connect at P5.];W[ir]
;B[df]C[I would play at C3 or C4 now. Since your group is alive and you are thick, taking away white's corner is good enough. But your move looks ok, too.]
;W[ch];B[jd]C[Very good.];W[jf];B[ld]C[Ok.];W[qc];B[pc]C[Wrong direction. The right side is bigger, so I would block at R16.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf]C[Once you blocked at Q17, you must play the nidan-bane at S14. This way, you can get sente in most variations.]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[rg]C[You must usually connect at O17.]
;W[id];B[ie]C[Because the shicho is bad, you must play at J17.]
;W[je];B[jc];W[hd]C[Unnecessary. Just capturing at H15 is easier.]
;B[dh]C[what to do? ok?];W[di];B[cg]C[The aim was to pull out J15, right? Therefore, you must play at E12.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[ci]C[Now I would prefer playing white.];B[cq]
C[C4 looks a little bit bigger.];W[dq];B[cp]C[B4 is the sure way to live.]
;W[bo]C[that was rude! Yes, but white is strong in the lower left, so he can afford to play rude.]
;B[co]C[anything else? No, you don't have a choice.];W[bn];B[do]

(;B[fk]C[Your group is in big trouble. The best variation I could find is a ko by plying at D2. Note that your move removes the aji of capturing the three stones around E6.]
