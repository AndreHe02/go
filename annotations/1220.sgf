C[exswoo:

Hi and thanks for taking time out to review my game.  This was one of my better games in recent memory and I felt good about this game afterwards even though I lost.  I'm hoping for tips on my opening and my early mid-game tactics, although I definitely want to improve my yose as well.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp]C[TJ: Since D16 is "high", an acceptable alternative would be a pincer around C8. Had D16 been at D17, then a pincer would be a bad choice, since after Black C3 W C4 etc, White's thickness would be facing the "low" and strong side of the upper left corner.

F4, however, is also perfectly good.];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]C[This a very common opening for me.

TJ: Black is developing harmoniously. The hoshi stone at D16 supports C9 very elegantly.]

(;W[iq]C[TJ: A bit conservative. K3 is normal -- Black cannot get a good result by invading at H3 straightaway. The chosen move gives Black a bit more space to operate in around O3.]

(;B[jd]C[TJ: A very good move, although R6 is possibly just a shade better, since approaches are usually better than extensions.]
;W[qf]C[TJ: Good. Both sides are playing well in this fuseki.]
;B[nd]C[TJ: My personal preference would be a pincer here, since this looks slightly overconcentrated (four stones in one part of the board). OTOH, I've seen pros make this formation, so I cannot criticise it! :-)]
;W[qi];B[qn];W[qo]C[TJ: This move is strong - the idea is to make you heavy by forcing Q6 and then to attack you, R11 being a pincer stone.]

(;B[qk]C[TJ: This is your first mistake. Of course you should play lightly, but Q6 is just too good a point to give to White.]
;W[pn]C[TJ: This is an excellent shape for White. Black can hardly sacrifice this stone since that would also involve the loss of the potential 3-3 invasion yet defending it is hardly easy either.]
;B[qm]C[Not exactly a good invasion....

TJ: The reason being that you allowed White the vital point of Q6. "Vital point", I think, means not only those points which determine life or death for groups, but also points such at Q6 which are essential for making or destroying good shape. A good shape move is usually even more valuable than a territorial one since it frees your hands for fighting later. Put it another way, if you get into bad shape because you want to grab a big point, then you will probably be forced to give back the territory - plus interest - during the fighting later on.]

(;W[rd];B[qc];W[ok];B[ol]C[TJ: Black should be able to escape with this move.]
;W[pl]
(;B[pk]C[TJ: This is a serious error, giving White a golden opportunity to seal you in. Q7 is essential.]
;W[pm];B[ql]
(;W[nk]C[TJ: Why not P10 extending White's moyo and assisting the only White group which looks weak (R11 and company)? This move would also remove escapological tactics based on a hane at P10 or contact play at Q11 or S11.]

(;B[jj]C[TJ: A terrible mistake since Black can live along the side still (please study the variations) using either S11, Q11, or even P10.]

(;W[cf]C[TJ: White should complete the sealing-in process with Q10. I'm sure Black should then die or at best get a horribly constricted life. The previous comments regarding this area of the board will continue to apply for the following moves, too, until somebody does something...]
;B[ch];W[bd]C[TJ: White should simply invade at 3-3. She won't get a better result by inviting Black to attack her.]
;B[cc];W[ef];B[fd];W[bc]
(;B[mp]C[TJ: B18 is essential. Black wants to keep White's group here unsettled so as to attack it; this move also has considerable yose value. Please see variation and comments.]

(;W[nq];B[mq];W[np];B[mn];W[nm];B[jo]C[TJ: Good shape. Black has done well here.]
;W[lo]
(;B[mo]C[TJ: Connecting is heavy...you can defend more fleet-footedly with moves such as L4. Capturing a single stone or even a small group won't usually be worth spending a move upon until the endgame. Remember when you play White in a high handicap game and you're offered small sacrifices, but when you take it you lose time or give the opponent strength elsewhere - well, this is what "sabaki" is all about, being prepared to sacrifice small in order to stabilise and develop your forces on a large scale.]
;W[ro];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[hd]
(;B[hc]C[Is this the correct way to defend?

TJ: H15 is the way to get a connection _underneath_, which is what I think you want here. H17 will get a connection over the top, which may be slightly less good because you forfeit territory at the top.  However, you go seriously wrong in the follow-up. Also, I think you should consider B18 followed by G15 hoping to attack two weak groups at once.]
;W[ic]
(;B[gc]C[TJ: This is terrible for Black.];W[id];B[jc];W[ib]
;B[hb];W[cb]C[TJ: A really bad result for Black. You will be sorry if you allow White G14 to seal you in.]

;W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[rj];W[nj]C[TJ: Defending the three stones is worth 6 points in gote, likewise, taking them is 6 points in gote for White. There are better points. First, T5 is pure sente - if White ignores it to get her 6 points with Q10, then you can destroy more points with S4. If she answers, you can then play O2. If she then takes the stones, you can play P1 in pure sente followed by S18. Both O2 and S18 are individually worth more than capturing the three stones, so you should be happy. I will make a variation to show you.]

(;B[pj]C[TJ: A mistake: this move defends 6 points in gote. It is much better to leave either defending or capturing here until you have no sente moves left.   RULE OF THUMB for YOSE: First of all double sente (points that are sente for both sides), then sente (moves which force a response and which end in sente!), then gote (choose the biggest or those with best follow-ups first!), finally reverse sente moves. Beware of moves which look like sente (because they force a response) but actually end in gote because you then need to defend them. Remember to take into account the "mutual value" (total value) of each play (that is, add the gain that you get from it to the gain he _would_ have had, had he played there).]

Thanks for your time :)

TJ: Both sides played quite well in the fuseki, but some vital points were missed. You both need to work on the endgame. Have the courage to sacrifice stones ("Sacrifice the plum for the peach"). I enjoyed reviewing this game. Good luck!]

(;B[bb]C[TJ: Not only very big but vital. If White played here, she would live unconditionally, while if you play here, then you will get to attack White's group for the rest of the game, which should be profitable. The reason this move is bigger (and bigger than it looks) is because it has territorial value to both sides, which must be added up to give its real value: if White plays here, then she gets an extra 3 points or so while Black loses 2 or 3 points, plus there are follow-ups to consider (White at B18 creats the chance to play D19 later in sente for 2 more points, while playing here gives Black the chance to attack this group, thereby gaining points). Therefore, this move has a total value of about 10 points at least, I would argue.]
