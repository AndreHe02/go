(;B[oo]C[very bad. you seem to be focused on killing too much.  but remember the game is about making territory, not
killing stones. When an attack fails, the attacker is often  left with a very weak shape. like you in this case:)

the correct attitude is to use weak groups of your opponent
more indirectly.];W[mp];B[mo]C[angwen> I wanted to build a wall and contain White close to the corner. I even finally did...

there is nothing wrong in building thickness. professionals do
this all the time. but you should know that the correct use of  thickness is one of the most difficult things in go. for beginners  i recommend a more profit oriented style of play. so better  try to make safe territory in corners and on the sides.]
