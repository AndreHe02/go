C[Hi!

My game was heavily centre-based. I lost large territories on the sides. Where I went wrong?

   Hi! My name is Zoran Rilak, I'm a student from Belgrade, Serbia; I also virtually exist as 'wayward' in the KGS community. It is an honour to me to be given a chance to review your game. 

   Although my KGS rating is 9k, please take everything I say with a grain of salt: mere difference in rating does not in any way guarantee that I have better understanding of _all_ the concepts of Go than you or your opponent do. Just look at this as another man's opinion, no more, no less -- 'munch' everything you see here on your own goban, and see if anything makes sense to you. If it does, then we've found a common tongue. ;)

   I hope you will enjoy reading this review at least half as much as I have enjoyed making it!

Have fun!
---
P.S. I have addressed both Black and White in masculine throughout the review ('he'), but that doesn't bear any chauvinistic intention; it's just a convention with no rational explanation whatsoever. ;) If any player in this game is a female and offended with this, please email me and I will send a corrected version.

This W G16 aims for a quicker development than F16 does, but the drawback is that it doesn't secure the corner completely. There is good reason why this is played one line closer to the 4-4 stone, either at 'A' or 'B' (depending on whether Black has a stone at K16 or nearby; a Black stone on a fourth line there will make you play B, and a lower stone means you want to go 'A', for influence). See variation for a somewhat deeper analysis. This move, as it stands, gives you only a bit more influence on the top, at the expense of the corner territory/shape. Bad :)
* * *]
(;B[di]LB[cc:A]C[* * *
OK, Black wants to play lightly. For the reference, check variation to see what would have happened had Black chosen to invade right away.
* * *];W[dl]LB[bd:A][fg:C][ck:B]CR[dn]C[* * *
   Hmm, let's see if white really wants to attack this group? As a rule of thumb, one doesn't attack opponent's groups if they can easily make shape/life -- such an attack will just make them settle and, perhaps, able to counterattack. Also, an attack is futile if there is no actual profit in it for you, for the same reason: attacking always makes defender stronger, and *sometimes* it makes the attacker stronger as well.

   This move seems to violate both of these rules. Black can easily settle by playing 'A' or 'B', or even run away with 'C' (not an option here, though). White doesn't really gain much with the D8 stone, since it is too far away from the D4 stone and a play at D6 or one line lower is still required to collect the cache, so to speak.

   If you *really, really* want to attack, do so by playing *under* Black's stones! There is a proverb saying 'if your opponent goes low, you go high', and vice versa. White 8 at 'B' would be more like it, but still I don't think there is any need to attack this Black group. Much better would be to concentrate on yet-unclaimed parts of the board. In the opening there are no big moves, only urgent moves (corrolary: 'there is no ko in fuseki'), so a play at the bottom, right side or even a top approach look much more positive to me.
* * *];B[ck]C[* * *
Now Black is being nice to you: he gives you the ideal 3-space extension of D4 from the two-stone wall at C8. Better for Black to tenuki.
* * *];W[cl];B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ed]C[* * *
Fine, so it all comes out into a quite peaceful division of territory. The position looks equal to me.
* * *];B[jc]C[* * *
Ha, so Black wants to provoke you? He should be punished for his rudeness! Just kidding :) I believe the purpose of this move was to make you defend your corner, and let Black jump back to his friendly Q16 stone, mapping out quite a large piece of territory. But!: White has nothing to fear, as his corner is safe, and Black has jumped just a bit too far away so he can be attacked. Consider the variation for a possible aggressive approach.
* * *]
(;W[ie]TR[jc]CR[ef][dg][eg][fg][dh][eh][fh][gh][ei][fi][gi]
[hi][ej][fj][gj]C[In retrospect this was probably a mistake. While this move certainly creates influence towards the middle of the board, black gets large territory in the top right corner. What would be a better approach to get some influence towards the middle, but also preventing black from forming such a large area in the corner?

* * *
   To answer your question, let's take a look at the overall board position. So far White has created some influence in the top left and bottom left parts of the board. Black group separating White's position is safe and ready to jump toward the center, so it doesn't make much sense in trying to gain influence which would overlap with Black's shpere (conveniently marked with circles). I think I've partly answered your question in my last remark: either separate and attack K17, or develop your own personal moyo at the bottom. Yes, there is no real justification in J15: it gives away too much while promising only very, very little.
* * *];B[md];W[ke]LB[gh:A]C[* * *
Following your idea, but bear in mind that all of what you've gained in those two moves can be erased by a Black stone at G12 or similar.
* * *];B[kd]C[* * *
Now Black is solidifying his positions while you fill in the gaps in your wall which cannot give you more than 5 points or so, if properly erased by Black. Ouch.
   For influence to materialize into territory, you mustn't push it: let it slowly build itself, never underestimating the importance of cash-in-hand, territory-taking moves as a way to cope with your opponent who builds up his score. Remember that to build a territory in the center it will take you *four* strong walls, and that is simply too much to rely your game on. Think of influence primarily as a source of attacking and reducing threats, and as a way to save your weakened groups which are forced to retreat.
* * *];W[le];B[ld];W[ne];B[nd];W[pf];B[qf];W[ph];B[qg];W[pg]
;B[pe];W[oe];B[pj]C[* * *
By now Black must have realized your center plan, but he doesn't show much effort to reduce it.
One of the reasons might be that he is already ahead in territory by 20 points or so...
Still a moyo strategy at the bottom, combined with some mistakes by Black and good endgame, might save your day.
* * *]
(;W[oi]LB[qn:A]C[* * *
This is simply too slow. It lets Black connect underneath and collect the prize. Check out the variation for a possible continuation.
* * *];B[qi];W[pm];B[ql]
(;W[qo]LB[qp:A]C[* * *
Attaching at R4 and the crosscut is the standard joseki continuation.
* * *];B[mq];W[kp]LB[rq:A]TR[pm][qo]C[* * *
Your two marked stones are still weak, so you need to settle them as soon as possible. Another reason why it is better to play 'A' is of more strategical importance: if your opponents goes in one direction, *don't* try to stop him; you will *always* make less territory than him (he's the one to play there first, after all). Instead, play in another direction and take a roughly equal amount.

No big mistakes in yose by both players, so the game ends as expected.

   Looking back at the game, it seems that White has made a bit more than Black had to give. There were many points at which Black was able to destroy most of White center territory, but he didn't do it, either because he was content with what he was gaining or due to his lack of experience.

   It seems to me that your biggest problem weren't your tactical or fighting skills (might want to work on your life and death a bit more, though), but your strategical approach to the game. Let's leave this as it is and go to a new goban, I want to show you something!

   You might have seen this already, but let's keep it here for the reference. As you might already know, this diagram depicts a highly idealized situation where Black keeps all the corners and sides, while White creates a huge center territory. It may seem as an easy win for White, but actually White is just one point ahead! (Not counting the komi, of course.) Count it out (or 'estimate score') if you don't believe me. ;)
   The moral is: don't put all your eggs in one basket - in this case, in one moyo. Don't think of a moyo as of big territory, because that's all a moyo is *not*. A moyo is just a huge area of influence which your opponent will come to invade sooner or later, and what you need to do is get prepared for his invasion and greet him warmly with artillery guns when he dares to do so. 
   If you feel insecure about making and estimating corner/side territory, I can recommend you to study some basic 4-4 josekis. There aren't many and they are not hard; plus, what I'd really like you to do is to find and read an excellent book on san-ren-sei ('three-star' fuseki), written by... umm... I forgot who :) - ask around. San-ren-sei is just great if you play black and love influence (and you're starting to get a hold of it, judging by this game), and if you're white, you will know how to stop your opponent from playing his game from the start.

   Well, I guess that would be all. If you have any questions or remarks regarding this review, I'd be happy to help. My e-mail is bruce@tesla.rcub.bg.ac.yu.

I am unsure of the prospects of this for any of the players, but White has certainly been given a target to attack and the marked group is in very little danger, considering its shape and eye potential. I'd say I'd prefer it this way in the game, had I played White. Also a high approach to the lower-right Black corner stone is very positive for White now, as it would show some progress in developing the bottom as well as aiding the marked group.

OK, here are the reasons why this move is superior over G16:
a) making Black's 3-3 invasion nonsense at this point (see continuation);
b) giving you a firm start in developing the top;
c) preparing an attack on the C14 stone at 'A' or nearby.

This c) is the urgent matter for Black, so he mustn't disregard extending C14 or woe and peril be upon him.
