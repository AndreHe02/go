;B[dp]C[C:  You had a very good sense in this game of when your opponent was trying to get away with something he shouldn't have been able to do.   But a few too many tenukis at critical times, and a bit of hastiness to jump at weaknesses before strengthening your own groups cost you a lot in this game.]

C[Unusual move in this situation.  See variation.

C: comments in variation.]
(;W[oq]C[I chose this move because it seems to negate the left side and kee
p me the corner.  I think the variation is a better reply.

c: Agree. There's no left (I assume you mean bottom? side really to negate, either.  Both right and bottom are same for black -- wide open.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[rp]LB[ro:a]C[This gives white an eye.  I think (
a) is better.

c: White's already alive -- this gives b the push (S6) in sente so he can fix his terrible shape.  But of course, B should have just played S6 directly and taken the entire corner if you didn't respond, instead of giving you a stone...]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[pm];W[nc]C[This seems to be a good extension from my t
op left stone.

It is, but it also encourages black to expand toward his thickness on the fourth line.  Invading will be more difficult.  It's not a bad move, but maybe better to attack the lone b stone in the bottom corner first and then decide what to do with top or right?  This might be just a matter of style, too, but I think playing where your opponent is weaker first is usually a good strategy.  I would C6.  B can't get much expanding on the bottom since you are strong there.]
;B[pf];W[jd];B[gd]C[I ignored this move because I thought it would be bette
r to play in the lower left first and deal with the double approach later.  

C: a reasonable decision.];W[dn];B[df];W[ee]LB[ef:a]C[Not quite the split I was hoping for.  Maybe an
 attachment at (a) is better.

C: Hard to say -- your move is fine, though, IMHO.  there are a lot of ways this fight could turn out.  If you want to emphasize the top, A might be better, but if your opponent didn't play as aggressively as he did,  you would have had a hard time killing either of the b stones with so much space to move.]
;B[ff];W[ge]C[C: attaching to a weak stone like this is usually not the best idea.  Pushing and cutting might have given you more options.]

(;W[fn]C[C: I'm a little too reckless often, so take this with a grain of salt, but I would consider a long extension from my strong group to h3.  This will force b to encourage w to extend and make a base in B's left side territory, and either leave the potential for erasing the corner or making territory on the right side, depending on how B plays.]
;B[hp];W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[cl]
(;W[dj]C[C:  The position of your stone is a bit aimless.  Before you make an invasion like this, think about how it will affect your neighboring group.  Your D6 group is not strong yet -- free, yes, but between two strong b groups, so not strong enough to attack from yet.   Make sure you're connected!  

Better to make a safer move and be satisfied that you got to reduce the scope of his territory in sente WHILE strengthening your own group.  

E9 much more effective -- B must defend, making mostly only third line territory between his two strongest groups (a loss for b) and then you can set up for more fun.  See move variations for one way of doing things.  

Just remember, B gave you twelve captured stones and a wall on the top for his strength on the left side, so forcing him to defend some 15-20 points in gote while you strengthen an invasion is a victory.]
;B[el]C[B splits, simultanesouly attacking two groups with an ideal move.]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[fh]C[C: Too soon.  First strengthen your running group -- you seem a little too eager to save stones -- they are probably better left for aji, though -- strengthen your group while *threatening* to save them.]
;B[gh];W[eh];B[dg];W[fj];B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[di]C[C: This only asks B to strengthen himself.  Better to take sente on the outside strengthen the running w stones.]
;B[ei];W[ql];B[pk];W[pl];B[ol]
(;W[om]C[C: A little small-minded.  Keep B from building a wall!]
;B[qk];W[rl]C[c: You took three B stones but let him rebuild the wall! Now his top corner stones are effective again.]
;B[nk];W[jq]C[Nice extension.];B[nm];W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[nl]
;W[gq]C[You are too short of liberties to Tenuki the bottom right corner here -- you cost your top left a lot of points tenuki -ing to get Q5 black stones earlier -- don't just give them up!  Also, remember B can rescue them in SENTE, and they will build thickness to help the group you are trying to attack with G3, worst of all worlds. So don't tenuki here!]
;B[no];W[qm];B[oo];W[pm];B[lo];W[mp];B[mo];W[jo];B[lm];W[kn]
C[Pointless peep not sure what I was thinking.

c: yup, this hurt you a lot, too.  H3 or H6 both big right now -- this might have cost the game.   But not as conceptually important as would have been E9 earlier.]
;B[do];W[cm];B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[eo];B[gm];W[gn];B[hm];W[hj]
;B[fi];W[ig]C[C:  Bad.  H6  G4 are WAY too important to tenuki.  Plus, J13 builds little territory (facing b strength) and does not connect to dying G9 stones.  Now you can see why E9 was so important....  

But you are trying to accomplish too many things at once -- killing the  bottom left and saving the few surrounded center stones are virtually incompatible goals.  Take the bottom; it's bigger!  Plus, you can erase the center from the top or bottom later.]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[in]
(;W[im];B[io];W[jm]C[You are creating a weak group nestled in strong black stones, in gote!]
;B[jn];W[ko];B[km];W[hl];B[fl];W[ik];B[ep]C[At this point I was thinking the group in t
he middle was alive.  I'm not sure were I thought the second eye was, but I
 was certain it was there.  This hurts me later as we will see.

Yes, giving up sente for the center, even if it lives, is a bad idea.  You can always reduce the center, but you only had one chance to kill the bottom. (though your opponent actually gave you a few chances]
;W[gp];B[go];W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[bq];B[cr];W[kq]C[Might as well try H3 here... you make it too easy for B.  

Also, B left a big yose move at B11, using the aji from C10,  Not the time to play it, of course...]
;B[hq]C[You can see now how important it would have been to strengthen your D6 group -- you gave up a lot on the bottom right to attack the bottom left, but because of D6's thinness, you instead got split, created a weak center group, had to make life on the left in gote. and lost your attacking stones (G4),   You had great instincts for attacking it, but not enough strength in your stones.]
;W[pc]C[Attachment gives B an awful lot (strength and territory) if you are going to just connect at P17.   Maybe slide to Q18 in sente, then S9, then reduce starting with a peep at P10?  You can help your center group too, maybe, that way.  

If you are hoping to invade, keeping B loose is good.];B[qc]
;W[od];B[pb];W[oc];B[pe];W[nf];B[nh]
(;W[mq]C[Good to spot this, but too early for it.  Wait until the endgame, because it's not as big as other moves: invasion of right,  K12, etc..  If you're willing to give up N4 all other stones are safe.  See var.]

ad and I resign.  I lost so much in trying to live I can barely hold on to 
what territory I had.  Perhaps at some point I should have given up on the 
middle group.

C: yes.  You fought hard and well for them, but B was too strong around you.  If you'd given them up from the start, built top/center territory threatening to save them, and then used that strength to invade the right side, you might have done better.  I'd say the biggest thing for you to work on is not leaving weak groups, even it it looks like there are bigger areas to play in first.  Once you've invested a number of stones in an area, tenuki-ing there can lead to gote weakness that might even affect the area you tenuki--d to play in!  Be a little more patient and willing to give your oponent some territory in exchange for strength, since he's going to get territory in the end no matter what.  Overly aggressive moves can end up getting swallowed and just increase your opponent's territory and thickness like D10&D11.]

Plus, B's high corner extension is totally negated -- he'd much rather have R14 than Q14 at this point -- you can make territory attacking there, too.
