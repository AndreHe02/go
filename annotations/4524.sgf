;B[qd]C[-- Hello,

my name is Zoran Rilak aka wayward[2k\] @ KGS.  I'll be doing the review for White as requested.  Please use my e-mail to ask any additional questions you may have!]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[pj];W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[qg];W[kc]LB[kd:A]
TR[pc][qd][qg][qp]C[-- Black has a very low position; only one of his stones lies on the fourth line.  This is generally not considered a good idea because whoever has control of center gains the upper hand in any invasion or fight anywhere on the board.  To make use of this, White needn't fear to boldly play L17 stone one line higher at A.]
;B[jq]LB[dj:B][jo:A]TR[dd][od][dp]C[-- Black maps out a moyo.  If Black wants to play a moyo game, White has nothing to fear; with three corner stones planted on 4th line, White will surely be the one to build a bigger one.  There are several possible continuations that lead into a moyo game; for example, a play by White at A or B would pretty much set the course.

However, if you don't feel at ease in a game with huge competing moyos, you can still play A or B and then switch to lower plays.]
;W[mq]LB[dj:A][mp:B]TR[jq]C[-- This is a wrong "point of insertion".  You are basically jumping into Black's jaws!  Letting Black attack your stone from the ideal point of P3 is just too good to be tolerated.  However, invading at P3 itself is also very bad, because Black would then play N3 and the result would essentially be the same.

When facing a situation such as this, the correct move tends to be neither one.  Note that even if White played something else (A) and then Black played B, Black would still be very much open to an invasion.  The point is that there is no rush to invade since there will still be time, considering that White builds up some support in the center.  Without such support, an invasion in this area is just as likely to fail with a Black stone at B as it is now, so just hold back and bide your time.]
;B[oq];W[gq]
(;B[lr]LB[lp:A]C[-- a slack move by Black.  Better to play above at A and push White from below; see variation.]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[mp];B[lp];W[op];B[pq];W[on];B[qm]
(;W[ho]LB[ln:A]TR[gq]C[-- You need to push from the weaker side.  This is a principal rule: whenever two weak groups are poised one against the other, it is imperative to push from the direction of your own weak group.  In this situation it is pretty clear which White group is weaker.  White should cap this Black group at A, gaining space for himself and chasing him towards his marked stone.  See variation.]
;B[ln];W[cj];B[nl]C[-- Now White is in real trouble :)];W[cc]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[jd];B[kb];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[mb];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[fe];B[fc]C[-- An excellent result for White.]
;W[db]LB[ij:A][cp:B]C[-- However, instead of this which is relatively small at this point in the game, play a bigger move such as A or B.]
;B[kd];W[mc];B[ke];W[ge]LB[kg:A]C[-- No need to protect here; Black cannot cut successfully.  Instead try capping him at A.  It is risky, though, because he might wriggle into White's large moyo, but then again if Black manages to save these two stones and captures White group on the top, the game will be as good as over.]
;B[lg];W[ga]C[-- That group is alive :)  See variation.]
(;B[ia];W[la];B[ja];W[qe];B[re]
(;W[og]LB[qf:A]TR[qe]C[-- Don't just leave this stone.  It can't be regarded as a mere forcing move since it is very important to White in terms of eye shape.  Push once at A and then play p13.  See variation.]

;B[se];W[le]LB[jg:A]C[-- White is alive, so there's no need to be squeamish and play slowly.  Play A for example, to build up moyo and put some pressure on Black.]
;B[kf];W[ih]C[-- Good, only one move too late; luckily Black felt obliged to respond.]
;B[kh];W[cn]C[-- To completely close off the corner, play at a 3-4 point.  This way Black can still muster a ko.  See variation.]

(;B[cg]
(;W[cf]LB[eg:A][dh:B]C[-- No need to attach here; we usually attach when we defend, and your stones on both sides are strong.  So play a cap at A or lean at B.  See variations.]

(;W[kn]LB[mm:B][dq:A][jr:C]TR[ln][lp][jq][lq][lr]C[-- Black is now safe because he can cut at A at will and either capture or get a favorable ko, or just connect at C.  This marked Black group is in no peril as well since it can connect at either B or C.  Therefore, White should push through at B and attempt to salvage the lower right group.  See variation.]

;B[mf];W[me];B[po]C[Erwin has resigned the game.

-- Good game overall.  You seem to try and not respond to your opponent's every move, which is a good thing, but do not overdo it.  You lost the game because you let Black connect the top group which was otherwise dead.  Even answering their moves one after another can be a good thing for you, if they are wasting their ko threats or stabilizing your weak groups -- in such situations we do want to follow on whatever plan they have, as long as it helps us too :)  Your style seems balanced, with the exception of endgame.  Try counting the territory once you reach the endgame; that will help you determine if you can win anyway by making ordinary endgame moves, or if you need some extra tesuji-crazy combinations in order to balance the score.

Have fun playing!
