C[JMiller: Thank you for reviewing this game. I'm black and AGA 5kyu.

srjh: Hi Jeff, I am Sami Halonen 2 kyu from Finland. In the review I tried to focus at invasions much as possible  though I have not studied invasions very much. I am not very strong at endgame so I left it mostly uncommented, but hopefully my advises will be helpful to you.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[op];W[dc];B[eq]C[srjh: Right direction.];W[do]
;B[gp];W[cj];B[jq]LB[kq:A]TR[op]C[srjh: Joseki move is at A. Would also work better with marked stone.]
;W[qo];B[qq]LB[kq:A]TR[jq]C[JMiller: Was this a good move? Should I have played at Q6?

srjh: This is only move, Q6 is bad. Now you can notice how much better would be to have the marked stone at A.]
;W[ql]
(;B[ce]TR[cj]C[JMiller: This seemed the biggest point, though I think a high approach would have been better.

srjh: This is the correct direction. High approach is lighter way to approach then this so it would haven been perhaps better because w has marked stone as pincer already. Also in this kind of positions it is not necessary to approach from the side pincer stone is positioned. See variations.]
;W[cg]LB[gd:A]C[JMiller: Playing somewhere near A is still possible. See variation.]

(;B[df]C[srjh: This is not very good move. Usually kosumi is played to separate opponents stones and after high approach. See variations.]
;W[fd];B[bc];W[bf];B[dg];W[dh]LB[gg:A]C[srjh: Better to move out at A.]
;B[cb];W[jc];B[mc];W[qf];B[qd];W[ph]LB[hc:A]C[srjh: Correct place to invade is at A. See variations.]

;B[ld];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[oc]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[JMiller: I didn't think I could get away with p18. Too many cutting points.

srjh: You were right p17 is the proper move here. Black is strong and can aim invading at A or B.]
;W[qa];B[eb]C[JMiller: I decided to take compensation.];W[fb]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[ed]C[srjh: Not sente...];W[gf]C[srjh: W decided to answer anyhow.]
;B[qb]C[JMiller:: I think this was slow, but my intent was to strengthen these stones so that when I invaded around p10, I wouldn't come under counter attack.

srjh: P17 group is not weak. R18 is small as was r19.  Better just invade now and play r18 later on if needed.]
;W[pb]C[srjh: This is a nice move for w use in this position.]
;B[ob];W[qc];B[rb];W[rc]C[srjh: S19 was possible but not better then the game.]

(;B[rd];W[sb];B[ra];W[sa]
(;B[qj]TR[ph][ql]C[JMiller: Better at P10?

srjh: I think q10 is also possible, r10 is still better. Usually this is the best spot to invade between stones positioned as marked. Though here  w has so supporting stones at r14 and r5.]
;W[pk]
(;B[pj]C[JMiller: Better at r12?

srjh: Yes. See variation.];W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[rg]C[srjh: Not working.]
;W[ri]C[JMiller: Better at p9?

srjh: I could not find a way for B to live. Perhaps better leave b stones as aji and continue at proper time.]

(;B[qk];W[pl];B[qm]C[srjh: This is not working.];W[rm];B[qn]
;W[rn];B[pn]C[srjh: B destoys some aji left behind, gets bad shape and annoying clumb of stones to manage, luckily w decides to pass few times...]
;W[nk];B[nn];W[ni]C[srjh: More important to do something about whites left side...]
;B[oh]C[srjh: Not working.];W[nh];B[og];W[ki]C[srjh: W decided to aim building moyo.]

(;B[ng]LB[pg:A]C[srjh: Cut at A is working now.];W[gn]C[srjh: See variation for invasion.]

(;B[cl]C[JMiller: I think this was too deep, but I got away with it.

srjh: Yes, this was too deep invasion. When planning to invade you have to think about few things:

1) What is point difference, how much can opponent gain territory here, is just reducing enough

2) Invading usually gives opponent influence so you must be careful about not having any too weak groups around also you have to consider that by gaining influence opponent can gain territory elsewhere

3) Does opponent have any weaknesses that you can use when you invade, having weaknesses does not allow play strong moves and makes living easier for invader

4) Are there any probes you should play before invading]
(;W[cn];B[bj]LB[dj:A]C[srjh: A is better, no way to make two eyes here]
;W[bi];B[ci];W[di];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[bk];B[bl];W[aj]C[srjh: W is squeezed yes, but B hasnt gained much eye shape here]
;B[el];W[en];B[cr]LB[fj:A]C[srjh: You should take care of d10 stones. W move around A would be very painful.]
;W[bq]C[srjh: luckily w decides to answer];B[gk];W[io];B[ip]
;W[fh];B[gm];W[fm];B[fl];W[hm];B[gl]C[srjh: Better play elsewhere instead of connecting]
;W[im];B[ik];W[kl];B[hh];W[hi];B[gi];W[gh]C[srjh: H10 lives, see variations.]

(;B[ii];W[hj];B[hk];W[gj]C[srjh: good idea to squeeze here]

LB[mq:A]C[srjh: W gains very much influence at price b living and p17 group is in big danger, also invasion somewhere near A is also possible.]
;W[mf]C[srjh: I did not way to live unconditionally here for b.]

(;B[ne];W[qg];B[rf];W[me];B[md]C[JMiller: I believe a move at p15 would have killed me.

srjh: P15 kills.];W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[qe];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp]

[ss]C[srjh: The biggest reason for black to lose this game was invasion failing on the right side also invasion at left side was too deep. Perhaps the best way to learn from invasions is just to play much also I would recommend reading some tesujibooks and learning some joseki. This is my first review so feel free to email me or contact me at KGS- server for more questions or feedback from this review.]
