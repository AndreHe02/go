C[To the reviewer:

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

This game is from the first round of a tournament, the "Vilnius Go Cup 2001".   I would like to ask you to make comments for both players because I want to discuss this game together with my opponent at our next club meeting.

I'm also asking your permission to publish a Lithuanian translation of your review on the homepage of our Lithuanian Go Federation.

(;W[eq]C[I feel this is a little early.  Perhaps white wants the option to invade later (see var).  After this exchange, black can still aim at the 3-3 point, but white will have more problems to invade.]

As black chooses influence and has given white territory on the left, white could now choose to neutralise the influence black is building. (see var)
