C[Hi there!

This is a game I just played in a German team tournament via the internet.
When playing on the internet, I don't consider me to be the second kyu I claim to be in RL, but I guess it's one of the better games I played on the internet so far. 
I reckon there were some serious oversights by both my opponent and me, and I'm afraid my strategy wasn't too good either. 
In fact I felt that my opponent got quite an advantage close after the start, with me having only a weak group for him to chase. Maybe he didn't use this opportunity properly, at least I felt not that much behind anymore after the dust had settled a bit.
Nonetheless, it seems to me that I still had less territory and only caught up in the endgame win by two points in the end. (That makes me feel rather happy after all, because I usually consider the endgame to be the weakest part of my game.)

I've gone over the game myself briefly, my own comments are preceded by "fey". 
Anyway, fell free to comment on everything you notice, any remarks you can make are welcome and will be thoroughly studied :)

I took the white stones here, both my opponent and me play as 2-kyu.

Best wishes,

=======================================================

Two general points:

Don't panic or guess about the score! Try estimating it as carefully as possible, then you really know what is going on, and can use that to plan a sensible strategy. It is difficult at first, but you need to learn how to calculate the score accurately to become a strong player, so the sooner you start practising, the better.

I don't know of a good online description of the method for estimating the score. The elementary Go seriese book "The Endgame" talks about it a bit. The best reference is the book "Positional Judgement" by Cho Chikun, but it is quite hard work.


The other comment is that a couple of times, you play 'forcing moves' that help your opponent. In fact, for a move really to be a forcing move, it must make the position better for you than for your opponent, as well as forcing him to answer. My favourite Go book is "Beyond Forcing Moves", and it explains this with some really good examples. You are probalby at about the right level to really enjoy it.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[oc];W[dp];B[pp];W[qj]C[Good.];B[fq];W[dn]C[fey: I wonder if a pincer would have been better here, but this early in the fuseki it seems merely a matter of taste, though I kind of dislike the position he finally got on the bottom.

I think your move is good. You have the potential to make a big territory on the left, so this is natural.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]
(;W[qn]C[R13 looks better to me. See variation.];B[pn];W[pm]
;B[on];W[qo];B[qp]C[fey: This result looks a little strange for black, with him being low on the left and high on the right. Maybe I should have played a reducing move against his bottom moyo now instead of my K17?

Right, you should be happy to finish around here in sente.

K4 next is possible, as is H4 (these are both standard moves). However I don't think you have to play at the bottom. K16 or 17 are fine too.]
;W[jc];B[qh];W[dj]LB[qf:B][oj:A]C[fey: I wonder if defending my right side would have been better, but still it seemed quite slow, so I decided to play D10 instead.

Defending at P10 (A) now would have been sensible. 

It is good to keep your group strong, so that you have the option of invading at the bottom without ending up with two weak groups. Also, A threatens to invade at R14 (B) later.

A is the sort of move that looks slow to kyu players, but dan players realise that it is worth it :-)]
;B[ql]C[fey: Hm, I totally misread the whole following sequence. I wonder if I thought at all... ;)]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj];W[ri];B[qi];W[pj];B[rk];W[qm]
(;B[oh]TR[oc][qd][qh]C[fey: As black, I'd possibly have attacked from the other direction, maybe as shown in the var.

No. I think that this is good for black. The four marked stones make an excellent formation. Also, white still has to defend the weak group, so there will be a chance for black to defend the bottom too.]
;W[ml];B[mn];W[km]
(;B[lm];W[ll];B[kl]TR[lm]C[fey: I don't quite like this for black, in my opinion, L8 creates a weak group for black too, in the end, and gives white the opportunity to reduce his bottom moyo. Maybe L6 was a possibility for him here?

Black M7 was a strange move. Pushing into a knight's move like this is normally bad. The right shape to cut is the 'strike at the waste of the knight's move' (proverb) at M8, but the outcome is unclear here. As black, I would just play L5]

;W[lk];B[ki];W[jk];B[mh];W[ni];B[ik];W[jl]C[Did you also consider J8?]
;B[ji]C[This is not a good result for black. White's weak group is now safe; black has damaged his area at the bottom, and the black thickness in the centre is not all that thick - there are cutting points.]
;W[kp]C[fey: At least I felt this let me recover a bit from my loss on the right. :)

Yes, good.];B[kn];W[jo];B[gn];W[ip];B[jq];W[po];B[op];W[oo]
;B[no];W[nq];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr]TR[kq][jr][kr]
C[This move may not be best. All the marked move threaten to capture the two black stones. one of them might be better. It may be better to leave your options open.]
;B[nr]
(;W[mc]C[fey: I considered this to be quite a big move during the game, but I'm not to sure anymore in retrospect. later, black got quite a lot of territory in the center, therefore, I should have probably played something near his center group first to prevent this, but that gives some aji-keshi feeling as well...

If you do nothing at the top black can launch an attack as in the variation. I think it is good to prevent that.]
;B[dl];W[cr]C[Good.];B[en]
(;W[dm]TR[cr][lr]C[Have you missed a chance here? With the two marked stones, the black group may not be completely alive, so if you cut it off, black may have to make a worthless defensive move. That might be better for you than just connecting along the edge.]
;B[em];W[cl];B[ck];W[dk];B[el];W[bl];B[bk];W[ci]C[Probably better to reduce the black stones to 2 liberties.

Did you think about a white play at G4? Black may not be completely connected. (It is probalby too soon to play this now.)]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[do]
(;W[co]C[It is better to capture the black stone, I think.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[hp];W[cc]C[fey: I actually became quite panicked about lacking territory here...;)

You should never panic about territory. What you should do is estimate it as carefully and as calmly as possible. Being able to estimate territory well is just as important in becoming a strong player as being able to fight well.

Let's try:

White territory:

Bottom left: 25 points. (Up to and including line 11)
Bottom right: 5 points.
Top right: ??? (very vague, deal with this later)
Komi: 6

Black area:

Bottom right: 18
Bottom left: 10
Top right: 35

So, it seems you will win if you can make 30 points or more at the top. Do you think you can do that. If so, your last move was probalby right. If not, you should have tried to find another plan.

I think you are probably OK. If black invades in one of the two gaps G17 or C13, you should be able to turn the other one into territory while he runs away, which is about enough, but it is close.]
;B[jn];W[in];B[ic]C[fey: Hm, I don't think I handled this well, plus, J17 was quite an unusual move to me.

I think black is thinking "I want to settle myself if white's area of influence." Contact moves are often the right way to do that (make sabaki). Generally, contact moves end up making both players stronger. Since your two white stones K17 and N17 might become weak, you should probably be happy about this.]

(;W[ib]C[I don't like this move. See variation.];B[hb];W[id]
;B[hc];W[jb];B[db];W[cb];B[jd]
(;W[kd]C[I don't like this. Your next few moves just seem to help black connect out solidly to the centre, without making your group much stronger. I would like to try putting more pressure on black as in the variation. It is quite dangerous, but I think it ends up OK for white.]
;B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[nb]
(;B[dg]C[This may be too greedy by black.];W[fe]C[Good.];B[ge]
;W[gf];B[he];W[cf]C[fey: Again, a kind of timid move. Enclosing with something like F12 was my first thought, looking at it again now it truly seems better. I wonder what I was afraid of. ;)

Yes!];B[ff];W[ef];B[fg];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh]C[Let us see what this exchange has done to the score:

WHITE

Bottom left: 25 (up to, and including line 11, as before)
Top left: 25
Top middle: 8
Bottom: 6
Komi 6

Total: 70


BLACK

Bottom right: 18
Bottom left: 12
Centre top: 20
Top right: 35

Total 75

So black probably is a little ahead.];B[fd]C[fey: He told me that this protected against wF11, but still it seems small regarding the fact that I feel that white is behind in territory and absolutely *needs* sente to still make a game of it.]
;W[pb]C[Yes. Black should have played P18 in sente at some point.]
;B[ob];W[oa];B[nc];W[lb];B[qb];W[pc]C[E15 is a very big move. It threatens F11, so it is proably sente, and Black playing at E15 is also sente. Play there while you have the chance. (It also gives you a nice follow-up at F18).]
;B[pd];W[qc]C[E15 is definitely bigger than this.];B[rc];W[pa]
;B[ee]C[fey: Possibly the bR19-wO19-bS18 sequence would have been bigger for black, though it is gote?

No, this is bigger, and sente.];W[df]C[You should play D15.]
;B[kr];W[ne];B[oe];W[od]C[Better just to play N16, since it does not create a cutting point in your shape, however, it only threatens to make 7 points in gote, so it may be too small.]

;W[rb];B[me];W[nf]
(;B[lf]C[fey: N14 would have worked for black, wouldn't it?

Well, it captures the two white stones, but it lets white capture S17 is sente, I think, so it may not be a gain for black.]

(;W[mf]C[I think you should play as in the variation, then you caputure S17 in sente, which is a gain compared to the game.]
