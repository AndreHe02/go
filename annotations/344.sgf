C[i won this game, because my opponent made some silly mistakes in the end, probably thinking that he was behind.

in general, i have a serious fuseki  problem, usually ending up in moyo games where i am behind right from the beginning. this is not so obvious here, but still bad enough. i'm not sure which points i would like to have addressed in particular, because i don't feel realy comfortable with my game right now, and i can't figure out what it is that i don't like, apart from the fusekis.

therefore i would appreciate any comments  ...




hello Tobias,

let me first say that fuseki is not really my strong point either. but i like moyos ;-)

it stroke me that you sometimes play (very) slow moves. i'll point the most important ones out.
since you didn't ask particular questions i'll point out things that jumped into my eye.


greets.
Steffen];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[pn]MA[qo]C[if you don't like moyos why do you play an the fourth line here? ;-)
R5 would be the standart move.

but this one is fine also...];W[mq];B[kq]MA[jp]C[right direction but too close. around k4 would be better.   the idea should be to you use your influence in the right buttom corner to attack this stone.

K4 would have two possibilities implemented:
a) attack the white stone by pushing it against your buttom right corner.
b) building a base by extending to the left.];W[op];B[pp];W[mn]
;B[ko]C[why not first settle this group and attack the white stones afterwards?
you could play much more relaxed then ;-)


here it is no good to chase white because your stones don't have a base themselves.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[on];B[pm];W[po];B[qo];W[oo];B[nr]C[this is an endgame move. there are bigger points on the board. this one is not important now.]
;W[mr];B[or]C[and it leaves you in gote...];W[hq];B[jo];W[ip]
;B[io]MA[km]C[now there come some slow stones. also consider other direction. L7 e.g. would put the white group to the right under pressure again.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[im]C[this one is particularly slow.];W[ml]
;B[pl]MA[ok]C[your buttom right corner is secure territory so this move is too slow.
it is not severe on white either.
e.g. with P9 you would push white and at the same time open up your right side territory.

if a group is already settled (like this one) try to find a move away from such a group.
try to find moves that have more than one meaning.];W[km];B[jm]
;W[fm];B[gm]MA[jm][hk][jj]LB[jm:a][im:b]C[where K7(a) was a good move since it created eyespace, this one is too low and lets white contain you too easily.

conlusion: wrong direction. escape towards the center. e.g. H9 or K10.

the idea is: this group is weak. perhaps you'll lose it. so it is not a good plan to connect too much stones directly to it (like (b) some moves ago). better spread your stones so that you will not have to discard all stones when time comes. you will get "faster" and less heavy.
after having added too much stones you will have no choice but get this clot to life.]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[kk];B[co]LB[fc:a][cf:b]C[your L4 group is still weak and you are going to get another weak group.


if you don't want to flee with your L4 group better play around (a) or (b).]
;W[cp];B[do];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[fn];W[en]MA[gn]C[white should keep the two black groups separated with G6, e.g.


idea: don't let two weak groups connect!

cutting opponent's weak groups (keeping them separated) and connecting own weak groups is a very important concept in Go.]
;B[fo];W[eo];B[gn];W[fp];B[gp]C[very tricky now ;-)];W[hp];B[ep]
;W[fq];B[em];W[eq];B[dp];W[el];B[dn];W[bn]LB[dl:a][hi:b]MA[co]
[gl]C[nice tactical sequence.


there are two things (actually three) i'd like to pull your attention to though:

1. white got a wall towards the top around D8(a).

2. the buttom left is now secure territory for white.

3. you got two prisoners and made life sure for a group that was in danger but could live some other way (e.g. by further escaping into the center (b)).



this sounds quite unfavorable, doesn't it? ;-)

let me explain what went wrong:
the move that initatied this sequence (C5) was too deep into whites territory already (back then i mentioned that you get two weak groups) and white could use his influence to put this stone under pressure.
as 3) indicates, you managed the situation but Go is always a give and take and you gave white more than you got in return (i think) ;-)

the idea would be to play in the top left corner instead of N5 in white's influence.
but pay attention to get your group around G8 out there later on!]
;B[bp]MA[bo]C[not necessary.  play somewhere else and keep B5 for later (B5 would be sente then. B4 gives you gote.)

the top is very empty!];W[cq];B[bo];W[bq];B[nc];W[qg];B[qd]
;W[qj];B[oj]C[quite good, attacking two white groups (R10 and N8).]
;W[rl];B[rn];W[pk];B[qk];W[rk];B[ok];W[pj];B[nl]C[well done keeping the two white groups separated!]
;W[nm];B[mk];W[lk];B[mj]C[tenuki, this one is too slow.];W[dg]
;B[jc]C[your top right corner is settled so better play further away.
you invite white to expand his top left corner.  risk something!


the idea here is that a settled group radiates power. playing close to such a group does not add much to that power.
so one playes further away inviting the other player to do something so that this power can work.]
;W[gc];B[of]MA[cc]C[this one makes just a few points (the white group around R10 is almost settled, so no attack). a corner-invasion would be big now.]
;W[cc];B[hg]MA[ji]C[consider this:
white's N8 group is still weak. you could exploit this weakness by attacking from the right direction.
playing K11 e.g. you could force white to escape to the left while building territory around the place you intended.]
;W[kh]
(;B[le]MA[cl]C[this, again, just makes little points.

perhaps an invasion into white's left side territory is possible. consider its weakness at C8.

[rr][rs][sa][sb][sn][sq][sr][ss]C[here is my conclusion:


i didn't find your fuseki to be bad. just make better use of your influence.

you'll have to look not to get weak groups in the very beginning though. your opponent could easily exploit this. so consider what is worth more: settling or attacking a group. (this is case-sensitive ;-))

after having settled a group don't play to close to it. use the influence a settled group radiates.

try to avoid slow moves. i hope by my comments you now have a picture of what slow moves are!?

moves with more than one meaning are good. try not to go just for territory or just for influence, try to connect these two (or other) concepts. (this does not necessarily mean "miai").

keeping opponent's groups separated and connecting own groups will make them weaker/stronger.


i hope this helps improving your play!
