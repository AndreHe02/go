C[D:  Reviewer, thanks so much for taking a look at this game.  It's a good example of the kind of game I have been playing lately, where I find myself playing territorially against a moyo strategy.  In almost every game, I have difficulty determining when and how to move my groups into the center, and I invariably end up with at least one group that must scramble desperately for life.

Comments: Andre Bergholz (3K, marked with AB)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]
LB[cd:A]C[D:  Better at A?

AB: Doesn't matter. At our level things like these make no difference.]
;W[dc];B[oc];W[pj];B[qn]C[AB: Good, two shimaris, that cannot be bad for Black.]
;W[di];B[fq]LB[ph:a]C[AB: Good, but you could also attack the Q10 stone, at R12 for example.]
;W[jp];B[cn]C[AB: Good.];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[ck]
;W[jd];B[ph]C[AB: Good again. So far, I think Black has a slightly superior position.]
;W[rj]C[D:  I considered an extension from the bottom right, continuing to press the white stones on line 10, and approaching the top left corner.  Which would you do?

AB: I think the White move is a little abusive. He  should seek stability for his stones. A move like R12 or Q7 would have been more reasonable for White. You should profit from White's mistake by trying to surround him, for example with O10.]
;B[ce]LB[bi:a][nj:b]C[AB: A good point, although locally B11 is good as well, you can afford to play safe. Globally, the attack on the two White stones on the right is urgent, I think O10 is the way to go. White will live small, but you will have considerable influence in the center afterwards, no way that White can get control there later on.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[dd]LB[cb:a]C[D:  Mistake?

AB: Yes. C18 is normal. Now of course you connect, and the exchange D16-C16 is clearly beneficial for Black. Black is stable, and C15 "sticks out", that's bad for White.]
;B[cd];W[ef];B[ek]LB[bi:a]C[D:  I felt like I needed to get that group into the center.  Is this a good impulse?  Are there forcing moves I should take first?  Is there a better way?

AB: Mmh, your intuition is good, but the move looks indeed a little slack. B11 is an alternative, but that risks to be confined to the side, so maybe your move is not so bad after all.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[po];W[op];B[pr]C[AB: Very good variation for Black again.]
;W[jq];B[nn]LB[nj:a]C[D:  What moves are bigger here?  Again, I felt like I needed a presence in the center, and I wanted to threaten the stones on line 10 a bit more.

AB: Yes, this move looks a little slack. Still, O10 looks like a good attack to me.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[em];B[dl];W[mc]C[AB: Big. But White really needs to do something about the two stones on the right. So I consider White's move an overplay.]
;B[qi]C[AB: Not so good. What if White ignores this move? Will you then cut at R10? You invest two stones for not much profit...]
;W[pi]LB[pl:a]C[AB: White needs to be flexible now. A light move like Q8 is more appropriate.]
;B[qh]C[D:  I couldn't read a good result with the push at R10 or the hang at S12.  What move would you select?

AB: Your move is good. At least, you have no more problems now, and can go all out.]
;W[pm];B[qm]C[AB: Risky, the cut at P5 remains for White.]
(;W[ql]
(;B[pl];W[ol]LB[on:a]C[D:  "Oops."  :(

AB: Yup, these are the things that decide games at kyu level. They need to be avoided. Right away White is more or less alive, so you don't get compensation from the attack. Instead, it would have been better to just connect at P6 for example. Then White is not settled, and  you have some options at the bottom as well, so there won't be many points for White there.]

(;B[cb]C[AB: Big, but I think the most important region is now the bottom. You F3 stone is by no means dead. You could cut D5 directly. Or move out G4.]
;W[pk];B[ho]C[AB: Ok.];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo];W[ep];B[gl]LB[in:a]
C[AB: Problematic. The two groups cannot be linked easily. It's hard to recommend something here. Maybe just running out with J6?]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[gn]C[AB: Painful for Black.];B[hn];W[fl];B[il]
LB[fk:a]C[AB: F9 looks necessary.];W[me]LB[gk:a]C[AB: White should atari at G9.]
;B[nh]C[AB: Not absolutely necessary. The focus is the lower left.]
;W[mj];B[cg]LB[gk:a]C[AB: No. Still F10.];W[gk]C[AB: Very big. Now Black's group on the lower side is isolated.]
;B[kn];W[pn]LB[oo:a]C[AB: That doesn't cut. Lucky Black! P5 cuts.]
;B[oo];W[mo];B[mn]LB[mq:a]C[AB: Well, if your group was not so isolated, you'd have much more liberty now to play more interesting moves, such as N3. As it is, you are at White's will and have to answer.]
;W[no];B[lo]C[AB: No! White will cut.];W[on]C[AB: Clearly.]
;B[qo];W[mq]C[AB: Now Black is somewhat in trouble. The whole development at the bottom was in White's favor. First, Black's group is isolated, and second, White's not so stable group is now completely alive. White gained significantly here.]
;B[or];W[lp];B[ij];W[ih];B[fr];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[go]C[AB: Unpleasent indeed.]
;W[er]LB[hr:a]C[AB: I think the other side (H2) was more interesting for White.]
;B[hr];W[ir];B[gs];W[jn];B[jm];W[ko];B[ln];W[lg];B[kj]C[D:  Once upon a time, I played C13...and it was greedy.  I feel lucky to come out with this result.

AB: C13 was not necessary. Finally, Black is alive at the bottom, but barely so. The price was high. Letting White cut with Q6 was a big mistake. Also, White G9 was where the trouble started.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[qc];W[sh];B[si]
LB[rg:a]C[D:  Misread.

AB: Yup. Reading is unfortunately the single-most important ability for progress. It's hard work, but necessary. A mistake like this can easily cost you the game, even if you played a good opening. That's why it is important to first learn how to fight, how to evaluate the relative strength of groups, etc. Then study fuseki afterwards.]

(;W[fb]LB[ga:a]C[AB: Mistake by White. G19 is correct.]
(;B[ea]LB[ga:a]C[AB: You can extend to G19.];W[hb];B[gh]LB[eg:a]
C[AB: A little vague. E13 is better. You threaten to enter White's zone or capture D11.]

LB[rl:a][hl:b][bp:c]C[AB: Not so interesting. Still S8, connecting H8 is sente as well. B4 is big, too.]

C[AB: Now you all of a sudden lost the initiative for not much. If White S7 now, the difference is enormous.]

[sr][ss]C[D:  B+2.5

AB: Altogether this game was very good. I think your strength is the opening. Later, in fighting you seem a little timid, and then you run into trouble. You need to evaluate the relative strengths of groups and act accordingly. If you position is strong you need to attack. If your position is weak you need to settle the stones quickly by playing vital points or escape or play lightly, accepting the possible loss of some stones in order to settle the rest. Then thee are some things in the endgame, but that is quite normal. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me (bergholz@gmail.com). Good luck!]
