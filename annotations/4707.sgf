LB[dp:1]C[Hi,

I played this game at the London Open.  I am a bit confused with how this game turned out, so I'm looking forward to your comments.

Thanks,
Simon

df: the main issue with your play is that is is not efficient. Your stones are not working together to enclose the maximum territory for each stone.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[de];B[dh]C[Usually black would play first in the last open corner, but this pincer is also OK since you have a stone below.]

(;W[dg]C[This is not good since it strengthens black.  The popular joseki at G16 will let black play in the open corner first.  White wants a move that will leave him with sente to take the open corner.]
;B[ch];W[fe];B[fc];W[pd];B[dl]C[I felt this was good so far for black.

df: agreed.  This move is well palced between your two positions.]
;W[iq]C[Usually it is better to enclose the corner before extending. This stone could end up in the wrong place after black approaches the white corner.]
;B[po]C[good];W[np];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or]C[The white extension on the lower side is too wide.]
;B[qk];W[fq]
(;B[fo]C[I want to build a moyo

df: I don;t like this move.  The left side is too small to be a moyo, and white doesn't have to answer this move.  It gives up too much in the corner.  I would attach at f4 and try to make white overconcentrated.]
;W[dr]
(;B[gp]C[I thought this was sente

df: even if white answers, it doesn't help your center much. The corner is big, so I think you should answer at C3.

White won't play around here, so you can try this move later.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[cq]
(;B[gq];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[cm]C[df: think about blocking here since white can't cut.  It leaves you better endgame.]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[kp]C[White gains much more in the corner and left side than black gains at the bottom.  This is a bad exchange for black.]

(;B[qf]C[df: since there is a group to attack in the upper left, you should think about approaching from the upper side.]

(;W[qe];B[pf];W[nc]
(;B[pj]C[df: This move is overconcentrated.  You spend too many moves to get too little territory on the right.

I would leave this move off and try to find some way to defend the right side while attacking the stones in the upper left.]
;W[oh];B[qh];W[ol];B[pm];W[nn]TR[fo][dp][co][cn][cm][dl]C[df: In this position it is easy to see how black is overcontrated. There are many stones in the lower left center surrounding a very small area. 

There are many stones on the right side - too many for the amount of territory.]

(;B[fh]C[I want to threaten the D15 move and expect it simply to run

df:Attacking from this side is good, since it expands your territory below.  Since black and white both have low stones on the top side, there is not much territory to be made there.

The key point for shape is one line higher.];W[gj]

(;B[cb];W[cd];B[bb];W[hf];B[hh];W[ik]
(;B[if];W[cg];B[bh];W[bf]C[I expected to be able to kill this group once it was surrounded, but I couldn't find any moves from here

df: killing a big group like this rarely possible.  A better plan is to attack it and take territory while you attack.  So you need to look where you can play to get territory.  Your stone at J14 is unlikely to help you make territory in the center, so it was better to take away the base and get some territory while you chase it away.]

(;W[qb]C[I was afraid white would force me to crawl on the second line, but the result in the game wasn't too bad for black it seems]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[ld]C[df: this is agood result in the corner.  you made a lot on the upper side.]
;W[ie];B[he];W[jf]
(;B[id]C[df: I don't like this move.  it gives white a lot of power in the center and makes his upper left group safe, to gain only a few points.]
;W[ig]C[df: now it looks like white will make much more territory in the center than you saved on the upper side.]
;B[hr];W[ir]C[I am ahead in definte territory at this point, but white has a lot of potential to make points in the centre.  I go about trying to reduce the centre, but not very effectively.  I think from here, I play very badly.

df: to reduce, look first at the widest way in, and play along the line connecting the white stones, or just outside it.

The upper center won't be big since you have several ways into it, so the lower center is the area you want to reduce.]

(;B[ii]C[df: this is not so good.  you need to reduce the lower area.]
;W[in]C[df: this move makes the center huge for white.];B[ml]
TR[ol][ik]C[df: this move is a little deep for a reducing move since it is inside the line connecting the marked stones.]
;W[nk]
(;B[mj]C[df: this invites white to push through.  you need to save your original reducing stone.]

(;W[oj]C[df: you don't need to answer this.  You have a chance now to reduce the center again.]

(;B[pi];W[kj]C[df: this is a little greedy, trying to capture the two black stones.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[oi];W[mk];B[mi]
(;W[gm]TR[ml]C[df: again a little greedy, assuming black can;t rescue his marked stone.]
;B[jk]C[df: good move];W[jj];B[ij];W[il];B[lk];W[kk];B[ll];W[nl]
;B[lj]C[df: excellent for black.];W[km]
(;B[dj]C[df: this is much too small.  If you want to play gote here, you can get much more.  Or you can block the monkey jump on the right side.  That's much bigger.]
