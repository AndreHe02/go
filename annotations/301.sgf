;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[qn];W[oc];B[pf];W[qh]C[w setting himself up for trouble.  b can make strong position in
corner, and then attack one of the two flanking w stones];B[qj]
C[i would
have strengthened b's corner instead of pincering here, since this pincer
allows w to jump out which strengthens one of w's two flanking stones while
weakening b's corner.    i would have played q17 for b instead of this
pincer, then assuming w answers at p16, i would then pincer at r9 instead
of r10 due to irritating gap at r8];W[jq]C[w should have jumped out in upper right.  both players are bouncing
around the board without finishing stuff.  it makes things dangerous for
both.];B[ce];W[ch];B[ee];W[kc]C[when b jumps to e15, it feels so important
for w to do something like f16];B[gc]C[this leaves bad gap at f16.  better
would be f17.];W[oh];B[nf]C[b needs a base first.  play something like s13
instead of o14.  assuming w answers s13 at s12, then b can play q7 or q18
to guarantee life and prepare to attack the upper w stones.  always make
base first.];W[mh];B[lf];W[ic]C[w leaving serious weakness at n17.  i would
play w n16 instead];B[cn]C[there's too much important at top to turn away to lower left now.
i would play b g15 to remain stong here.  both continue to claim upper left
corner and attacks the w c12 stone.];W[gp]C[w missed opportunity here to
make both a base and pincer simultaneously with c9.];B[cj];W[eh]
;B[hf]C[b's
position still not secure at upper left.  i would be more comfortable with
something simple like f16.];W[bf]C[how about w b15 instead.  if b blocks it
at b14, w extends into corner at b16 and b needs to then protect outside,
lest w connect through with b13 wedge, and if b does protect outside, w
lives in corner with b18. if b responds to w's b15 by blocking on inside, w
extends back to b14 and b needs to fix corner at c16 and w has
sente];B[be];W[gh];B[cc]C[as b, instead of c17, i'd feel compelled to play
d8 which both stabalizes b's left side position and attacks the w stones
above it.];W[cb];B[bc];W[fb]C[again, w still had f16, which might have been better than f18.  all
this goes to show that b's original corner move of g17 was inadequate, as
so many extra stones (b15 and c17) were needed to completely kill
w];B[gb];W[db];B[fc];W[md]C[it's really painful that b didn't get an
opportunity to play n17.  note that if be had prevailed in this entire
upper right and killed the w stones here, it's much more profit than the
small life w could make in upper
left.];B[qb];W[je];B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[rf];B[re];W[ec];B[fa]

;W[ie];B[lq]C[again, b isn't following up what he started.  instead of m3, how
about pushing at k12 ?  it attacks both middle group of b stones by
splitting them.];W[if];B[ig]C[again, i'd push at k12 instead of j13.
attack large stuff .];W[hi]C[now w is both connecting his 2 groups plus
attacking w's left side.];B[ii];W[fh];B[ji];W[lj];B[hj];W[rg]
;B[hh];W[kk];B[dh]C[this d12 wedge is attempting to separate two w pieces when b would
really like to attack the whole thing !  instead, perhaps just quietly play
d8 to make safe.  that prepares b to attack the w group above.  if w
protects the w group above, b slides nto corner at b3 which gives enough to
win the game.];W[di];B[dg];W[ci];B[ei]C[b going after small piece while
b's entire left side is still at stake.];W[dj]C[in general, i'd say pay
more attention to making groups safe before attacking, and then attacking
wholesale rather than piecemeal.  [end of comments by Eric Osman
