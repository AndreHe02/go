C[plasma: Hi, and thanks for reviewing this. I've added a few  comments along the way, but I'd still like to have all my mistakes pointed  out.

It's not so much that I feel I played badly, but there were a few times,  especially near the start, and also in the middlegame, where I wasn't sure  how to play.

I'd appreciate a few pointers, though the game wasn't particularly violent  so I guess the review doesn't have to be too in-depth.

Many thanks.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cj]LB[oc:a]N[Black should play
somewhere around  'a'.];W[po]LB[od:a][pl:b]TR[dd]C[plasma: Perhaps 'a' instead works better  with my marked stone?]
N[Yes, 'a' is slightly better I would say. Black  should pinch around 'b'
in this  position.];B[qj];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql]N[White got a nice
extension  here.];B[mp];W[od];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb]
;W[lc]LB[ld:a]C[plasma: Is there a  better move? Perhaps 'a', since I'm not getting territory here anyway?]
N[Not  really, if you got a nice moyo on the left then 'a' would be  better.]
;B[fq]LB[cn:a][fp:b]N[White 'a' is better, 'b' is helping Black to  strengthen
the bottom moyo.];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo];W[ep];B[go];W[gq]
;B[hq];W[fr]LB[gr:a][hr:b]N[Black  should play 'a' to protect the land.
White probably can't start a ko at 'b'  that early as there are no effective
threats  now.];B[dn]LB[hr:a][cn:b]N[White 'a' is very big and if you want
to play on  the left, 'b' is a better point.];W[co];B[cn];W[qh]
C[plasma: A good idea or not?]N[Yes, it is a good  invasion.]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[rj];B[qg]LB[pj:a]N[White 'a' better, more  land and
thicker.];W[qk];B[pj]LB[cg:a]N[White should play somewhere around  'a',
remember to stay a distance away from thickness.];W[dk]LB[ej:a]
[dh:b][rg:c][rk:d]C[plasma: I wanted to reduce Black's central  influence. I considered the cap at 'a' as well, but I thought 'b' was a good  response.]
N[Exchange of White 'a' and Black 'b' is to Black's advantage, so  White
should avoid doing so. On the right, Black still got 'c' sente or some
 aji after cut at 'd'.];B[ck]LB[dj:a][ek:b][bl:c]N[Weak respond from Black.
 Black 'a' to 'c' better. This way, White 2 stones in the center can be
 heavy.];W[dl]LB[dj:a][fk:b][ej:c][gl:d][cf:e][cl:f]N[Black should play
'a'  to 'e' here, point 'f' is like a dame move.];B[cl];W[dj]

;W[ke];B[bg];W[hr]LB[bf:a]N[Good move, this is definitely bigger than 
'a'.];B[iq];W[bf]LB[ir:a][jq:b]N[White should exchange 'a' and 'b', it
is 2  more points for  free.];B[bn];W[bo]LB[af:a][ae:b][ag:c]

[mj:e][lj:f][li:g][kj:h][gl:i]N[If  you can restrict Black's moyo to about
20 points, you can win, so I would  play 'a' to 'i'.];W[jm]
LB[il:a][jl:b][jk:c][kk:d][kj:e]C[plasma: An erasure move, but was it well  placed?]
N[Too deep an erasure. White will be  in danger if Black to play 'a' to
'e'.];B[je]N[Wrong direction + helping  move again.];W[kf];B[ne]
;W[nd];B[hl];W[jk];B[rr];W[rq];B[lh]LB[ij:a][qb:b]N[White 'a' better, you

N[Peep at 'a' is  better.];W[kj];B[rg];W[lk]N[Good move, Black should play
here also.];B[mj];W[hk];B[il];W[jl];B[hg];W[ig];B[if];W[hh]

LB[ap:a][an:b][bp:c][aq:d]N[Bad  move, should play 'a' to 'c' to protect
the lower left corner. Black 'd' is  at least 5 points if not more.]

here.];W[ap];B[af];W[an]LB[bm:a][ad:b]N[Black got a choice here, 'a' to
defend,  'b' to erase some points at top left corner.];B[am]

C[plasma: This move lost Black the game, as it gave  me an extra prisoner.]
