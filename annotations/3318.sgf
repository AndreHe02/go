C[Hello! Thanks for looking on my game :)


Daedin: Hello!
Daedin: I am Daedin, aka Kyoshinai on KGS.
Daedin: My pleasure :)];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[jd];W[jp]
;B[pj];W[dj]
(;B[cf]C[Daedin: Wrong side by Black]
(;W[df]C[Daedin: When you have a stone at D10, a good answer to bC14 is wC15 (see var.)]
;B[bd]
(;W[de]C[Daedin: Too slow, and White doesn't settle himself.

Daedin: Try avoiding line play. Even if you fear being cu, there are better ways to connect; for instance C15 keeps you connected too, and puts pressure on Black.]
;B[cc]
(;W[cd]C[Daedin: Take a look at White's shape here. There is an empty corner in C16-D16-D15, that is to say a corner with no Black stone at C15. Though that is not always true, usually you should try to avoid that kind of shape - which is called 'bad shape'.

Daedin: A possible answer to bC17 could simply be wD17];B[be]
;W[cg];B[bg]
(;W[dg]C[Daedin: No need to fear the cut - yet. D12 is better I thnk, since it puts more pressure on Black.]
;B[bi];W[ch];B[gc]C[Daedin: A bit risky I think. Black still is a bit thin on the left.]

(;W[bc]C[Comment: This was a bad mistake i think. How had i should react?

Daedin: Here you had better block simply at D17. 
Daedin: Black left group isn't safe yet, and if he doesn't pay attention he might get killed.]
;B[bb]
(;W[ac];B[ab]
(;W[cb];B[dc]C[Daedin: Be careful, the two white stones at B17 are in atari, so the ladder won't work here.]
;W[ec];B[db]
(;W[da];B[eb];W[fb];B[ca];W[ea];B[fa];W[fc];B[gb];W[ed];B[jj]

(;W[hc]C[Daedin: Better cap at G16.];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[id]
;B[he]C[Daedin: Generally speaking, try and avoid playing scattered stones like that - unless you are in a life and death situation.
Daedin: The main goal when attacking a group is either
(a) to kill that group - which obviously can't be done here
(b) to gain enough strength during the attack, and then either settle your group or use that strength to attack another group.]
;W[fd];B[ie];W[ic];B[jc];W[je];B[ib];W[fp]C[Daedin: Not the point here.

Daedin: Moreover this is still small. If you want to change places, then an approach at O3 seems better.]
;B[mp];W[dn]C[Daedin: Small again.];B[cl];W[dl];B[ck];W[bh]
;B[ah];W[cj];B[bj]
(;W[ci]C[Daedin: Better block at C7];B[dk];W[ek];B[dm];W[el]
;B[cm];W[ej];B[cp];W[do]C[Daedin: Connecting like that is seldom useful. Better play C5, which both prevent the cut and threaten the C4 stone.]
;B[bq];W[cn];B[dq];W[em];B[bm];W[bn];B[al];W[an];B[bk];W[ep]
C[Daedin: Again, E3 better.];B[dr];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[md];W[es]
C[Daedin: Good point in not answering Black move.

Daedin: This a life and death problem. If you are trying and kill the Black group, try and find its vital spot. That is some exercice that is difficult to improvise out of the blue, but needs training.

Daedin: I suggest that you visit www.goproblems.org for instance, and try some basic Tsumego (life and death problems).]
;B[ds];W[bo]C[Daedin: What is the point of that move ?

Daedin: When playing a stone, always ask yourself: what do I want to achieve through that ?]
;B[br];W[bp];B[aq];W[ap]C[Daedin: Same here];B[bs];W[co];B[fs]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[cp]C[Daedin: You won't lose much if you have that stone captured. So it is not the time to fill at C4.]
;B[gr];W[fq];B[ir];W[hr];B[hq];W[gq];B[hs];W[jq];B[hp];W[ip]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[io];W[jn];B[in];W[im];B[jo];W[ko]C[Daedin: Same remark here as before about scattered stones.]
;B[kn];W[jm];B[kp];W[lo];B[lp];W[ln];B[km];W[kl]C[Daedin: Try and read the ladder to its end. First it will provide you with one of the best exercises to begin your training in reading. Second you will avoid starting a ladder that does not work :)

Daedin: Here White is lagging behind. In order to catch up, you need to make some territory, and so invade the left side.R6 could be a way, though Black is quite strong everywhere.

Daedin: No comment beyond this point.];B[lm];W[mm];B[ll];W[lk]

;B[ob];W[nb];B[na]C[Here i left the game. im a bloody beginner ^^'''

Daedin: Being a beginner is no problem, since everybody is one at a time ^^
Daedin: At first, you should play quite a lot of games (around 50-100), keeping nothing but a few things in mind: 
(a) try keeping your groups connected
(b) avoid "line play", that is to say forming groups that are long lines of stones. A group that has "volume" is better that a long one in quite a few cases.
(c) do not scatter your stones (see a :p)
(d) when playing a stone, ask yourself why you play it
(e) lastly, try some easy tsumego, such as ladders or so, to improve your reading skills. Playing with feeling may work in some situations, but it is clearly not enough.

Moreover, when submitting a game for review, the best way to benefit from it is to review it yourself. You already know how the game went, so you can use that to try and see where you made big mistakes that led to that situation.
You can also use this opportunity to ask the reviewer of question that arose during the game or during the time your were reviewing your game. This will also help them to see how you were thnking, and then they may be able to provide appropriate commentary on specific points.

All in all, keep on playing, and play simple moves. You will progress little by little, and then you will be able to do fantastic things as seen on TV :p

Good luck for you in the future.])
