Dear reviewer,
i play black in this game against Igowin.
I know that I would have win very easily, but I have started playing Go a week ago!
Sorry if this game is boring, but I would like to improve, so, please tell me what colossal mistakes I have made in this game.
Thank you a lot!

(phi) Hello, I will do my best. phi@gressly.ch (http://go-winterthur.ch.vu)]
;W[gg];B[dd]LB[cc:A][dc:B][cd:C]C[(phi) On a 9x9 board is this a bit risky. The 3x3 Point (C7) can still be invaded. To play directly on A (C7) (or B or C) makes more secure territory.]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[(phi) good: let white live in the corner, but let him live small.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[bb];B[bd];W[eb];B[fb];W[da]
(;B[fa]LB[ed:A][ge:C][eg:B]TR[fa]C[(phi) Here white has no chance to make a great territory. This move (F9) is too deffensive. Even the cut at A (E6) should not frighten you. I would play at B (E3) or C (G5) instead and secure some territory at the bottom. See variations on the previous move.]
;W[bc]
(;B[ad]LB[eg:A]C[(phi) same as before. White can not invade, even if you don't play this move. (See variation on the prevous move.) I would have played at A (E3)]
;W[eg]
(;B[df]LB[ge:A]C[(phi) Playing at A (G5) makes lot more territory. See variation on the previous move. A move like A makes your territory bigger and your opponents smaller. It is allways a good strategy to have moves with multiple purposes.]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[dh]
(;B[ef]LB[ch:A]C[(phi) The edge is much more than the center. Better play at A (C2) to secure the corner.
You could still win playing at A. See variation on the previous move.]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[ch]
(;B[bg]LB[bh:A]C[(phi) play directly on the 2x2 point A (B2) to make some more points. See variation on the previous move.]
;W[bh];B[ag];W[fd];B[ed];W[ac];B[ea];W[db];B[fc];W[aa]C[(phi) White is already alive in this corner. This move was not necessary.]

(;B[ca]LB[ie:A]C[(phi) You can not kill a group with 2 eyes. This move was wasted. Better play at A (J5) and make 4 Points in sente. See variation on the previous move.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[ie];B[ff]C[(phi) good.];W[hg];B[gf];W[hf];B[fg]
;W[fh];B[ah];W[dg];B[cf];W[bi];B[ai];W[tt];B[tt]C[(phi) The game was calm. Neither of you tried to take too much. With a little training you should be able to win against Igo for Windows. But remember the following.
As soon as you win against a computer program, stop playing against it immediately!!
Never ever give handicap stones to a program!
Otherwise you train a lot of moves to trick the program which will not work against human opponents.]
