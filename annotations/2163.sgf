see the branch here.]
(;W[ej];B[ei];W[fk];B[gk]C[One thing I have noticed this game is that you suffer from weak shapes. If your shapes are too weak, they are easy to break though and cut apart. Remember, getting cut apart means many weak groups, which are hard to defend.

See the branch for an example of weak shapes]
(;W[gl];B[fm];W[gj];B[fi];W[hk];B[hm];W[cj];B[bj]C[Good hane or bad hane?

Well, not really a big move now because white has a ponuki at G9 and is obviously going to live. C4 probably better to get the corner (30 points or so).]

you have to anticipate it before it happens (like some of the suggestions I made earlier). This is where experience really helps.]

I wouldn't bother with the L5 group. Better to take something like M13.]

(;B[lk]C[Was this move good or bad?

well, it doesn't really connect, and black is suffering from a weak shape again. See the branch in the tree.]

(;W[lj];B[kj]C[This was played to keep the connection between upper and lower groups. Was it a good or bad idea instead of defending at N11?

Cutting apart is a bad idea when it is you getting cut. Defending at N11 would be my move here.]

;W[rc];B[pk];W[ol];B[qk];W[rk];B[go];W[kp];B[ik]C[Bad move. Should have defended at O12.

yes, black is suffering from weak shape a lot. This is an area I would work on. weak shapes are created by having several 1 stone and 2 stone groups "connected" with many cutting points and few liberties for each group. Often it is better to withdraw slightly and make a 1 stone or 2 stone group stronger by adding a stone (and typically 3 more liberties).]

No, J8 connects black to J5 group, and white stones at N16 are dead (but be careful).]
