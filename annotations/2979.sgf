C[[Hikaru79\]: Hello! =) I'm Adrian Petrescu, around 10k when I played this game. Guo Juan 5p was kind enough to play this with me over the Dragon Go server; however, it was not a teaching game, so no review was provided. Therefore, I'm turning to the GTL to find out what was going on this game =) Thanks for reviewing!

csh: It's a little intimidating to review a pro game, but I'll do my best! :) I don't know if my advice will help you beat Guo Juan, but perhaps it might help you think about new ideas.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]C[csh: Fuseki theory says that the empty corner or making a shimari (corner enclosure) in the lower right is bigger.]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[dp];B[po]LB[qm:A]C[csh: The one-space jump shimari has a weakness at A. If White gets a play at A, she threatens to slide into the corner and take away your base.]
;W[kd]
(;B[mf]C[csh: This move only runs out to the center of the board. You might be able to play the kosumi (diagonal move) to keep the stones separated. See the variation.]
;W[mc]C[csh: White connects underneath, and now has no problems in the upper right of the board.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[od];W[pc];B[qc];W[pd];B[pe];W[ld];B[of];W[qk]
C[csh: This invasion looks to split up your right side and make a viable group. The group can expand up or down the right side of the board, depending on your approach.]

(;B[qi]C[csh: I like the idea of pushing the white group towards your thickness, as the group in the upper right should have little trouble making life. See the variation.]
;W[ro]C[[Hikaru79\]: I was caught by surprise here. R7 seemed logical, but after the game, I checked some databases and R7 is never played in response to S5. What would have been a better reply?

csh: Well, part of the problem is that your corner still isn't solid. Because the corner isn't solid, White can play a little more loosely and expect to not be attacked as hard. R7 doesn't split the white stones apart. It's not good to solidify White's position.]

(;B[qm]C[csh: See the variation.];W[rm];B[qn];W[rn];B[ql];W[rl]
C[csh: Now White has a base, and is harder to attack. Black lost an opportunity. This is a bad result for Black.]

(;B[pk]C[csh: I think you should try to get something out of the wall you created. Instead of this move, perhaps an extension along the bottom of the board would be better. See the variation.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[jp]C[csh: This move eliminates the thickness you got from the wall.]
;B[fq]LB[cj:A]C[csh: Interesting idea, but I think this stone will be a liability. Maybe just splitting the left side at A is better.]
;W[fo]C[csh: White presses on the stone, looking to build a moyo on the left later.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[hq];W[ho]C[[Hikaru79\]: I wasn't anticipating this. When it happened, I realized that perhaps my original approach at F3 was not ideal. How best to salvage this situation?

csh: Salvaging the situation is always hard. I think you do okay by sacrificing a stone, but you have to realize that you are falling behind in territory relatively quickly. I'd look at invading the left around C10 to try and keep White from getting all the lefthand side.]
;B[io]C[csh: I don't know that I like this move, as K4 is already peeping at the cut. If K4 wasn't there, this move would be fine. I have a lot of problems finding a better move locally, though.]
;W[gq];B[ir]C[csh: This shape is weird. It doesn't really protect the cut at J4, which I think is more important than connecting to the F3 stone.]
;W[gr];B[jo]C[csh: So now you have to spend another move...]
;W[hn]
(;B[jj]C[[Hikaru79\]: Is this move appropriate? I played it hoping to build a strong central moyo, but it didn't quite work out that way.

csh: The center is always looks bigger than it really is. I think establishing a base on the left is more important. That'll keep White from getting a huge amount of territory on the left.

I also think there are issues with the K4 stone. If White attempts to pull it out, there are problems with the J5 group later... (Note that trying to pull the stone out directly is a bad move, but the possibility of White playing move in the vicinity of L4 later makes the J4 cut worrying. Black cannot fight as hard in the vicinity until the J4 cut is taken care of.

I was considering playing L4 to solidify the bottom, but then Black falls behind in potential territory. I added this as a variation.]
;W[jm];B[lo];W[lm]
(;B[im]C[[Hikaru79\]: Probably my biggest mistake in the game. I panicked when I saw the K7/M7 stones jumping so freely into my framework. How else could I have dealt with this?

csh: I don't think you can hold onto the center. I would look at salvaging the situation by playing at M10 or so and looking to invade the left. See the variation.]
;W[in];B[jn];W[jl];B[il];W[ik];B[ck]C[[Hikaru79\]: Is this too close to the white strength along the bottom?

csh: I think so. Just out of curiosity, why did you play here? I would have thought one move higher, maybe at C10.]
;W[ci]C[csh: White pushes you towards his strength.];B[cn];W[bo]
C[csh: Then White sweeps the leg, and doesn't give you a lot of room to live.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[bp];B[ej];W[hl];B[qq]C[csh: This move is big in yose, but I think there are more urgent parts of the board. Assuming that your left group will live (which I am not sure about) I think you need to look to invading the upper left 3-3 point next.]
;W[qj];B[df]C[csh: This move is bad. When White splits, it creates another weak group for White to attack.]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[hi];B[eh];W[fi];B[di];W[dh];B[dj];W[dg]TR[df]
[eh]C[csh: The marked stones have effectively been wasted moves.]
;B[eg]
(;W[ef]C[csh: I was really surprised at this trade. I thought White might play the hane at C14.]
;B[cf];W[fg];B[ch];W[fh];B[cg]C[csh: Black lived on the left, but in gote.]
;W[be]C[[Hikaru79\]: I was pretty happy with the exchange I made here (taking C11 in exchange for E12/13). But I started becoming very distressed by the formidable white territory on the top edge. I dove in at F17, but what other alternatives did I have? D17 perhaps?

csh: I suspect that White made the exchange to make a lot of territory at the top. :)

I don't see a good invasion point at the top of the board, as White is really thick in the area. (I suspect this is another reason that White made the trade... White is left with few weaknesses in the area, and can fight hard against an invasion in the upper part of the board.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[pj]C[csh: It's a little strange to invade, and then tenuki (play elsewhere.) The sequence on the right ends up being gote for Black.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[rj];B[qh];W[de]C[csh: Now White gets another move in the upper left, making the invasion even harder.]
;B[hd]C[[Hikaru79\]: This seemed like the only way to save this stone (and it did work), but were there any better ways to make life here? Perhaps by diving in the corner somewhere?

csh: Actually, the F17 stone isn't saved. It gets cut off later. I also don't think there's a corner invasion anymore. I think you make a good showing here, though, of sacrificing stones and connecting out, reducing White's territory in the process.]
;W[ic]C[csh: White just takes territory with a solid shape.]
;B[gc];W[eb];B[id];W[jd];B[if];W[gd];B[fe];W[ie];B[hf];W[he]
;B[gf];W[jg];B[ih];W[jf];B[hh];W[fd];B[ee];W[gj];B[ii];W[ij]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[mh]TR[lg][lm]C[[Hikaru79\]: Still trying desperatly to cling to *some* center territory.

csh: With White peeping in with both marked stones, I think it's highly optimistic to think you'll get any territory in the center.

That being said, I still think this move is the right idea, as it helps your H14 group connect out.]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[lh];B[li];W[mi];B[mj];W[nh];B[lk];W[nj];B[nk]
;W[bi]C[[Hikaru79\]: What does this move accomplish?

csh: This is an endgame move. It forces you to take the two stones, playing four more moves inside your own territory.]
;B[bh];W[bf];B[bj];W[mo]C[[Hikaru79\]: Where everything else started falling apart. How to deal with N5?]

(;B[mn]C[csh: I think the hane above is too aggressive.];W[ln]
;B[lp];W[mp];B[nn];W[lq];B[ko];W[ip]C[csh: Ouch! The J4 cut! :(]
;C[Result: W+Resign

[Hikaru79\]: I thought I had something going here, but Guo Juan just completely tore into my center. Except for J7, I can't see any large oversights or blunders, simply a failure for me to find any counter to her moves. I was barely able to reduce her top side territory, I failed to keep my center, not because of mistakes I can see, but because of a general failure to find anything else.

I'm hoping you'll be able to come up with some different ideas for how to deal with this game =) Thanks!

csh: Well, playing an even game against a much stronger player is really a good experience. I think you did well.

I think one of the problems in this game is that Black made too many weak groups. Weak groups are usually a liability, allowing the other player to chase them while making territory. Even if the group doesn't die, the territory that your opponent makes while chasing you might be enough to win the game.

For example, look at the invasion in the upper left. The group managed to connect out, but only made five points or so. White, on the other hand, made about twenty.

I hope some of this advice helps you in your games. If you win the rematch, please let me know. :)]

(;B[ne]TR[oc][kd][md]C[csh: When the marked stones are in this shape, this kosumi (diagonal move) threatens to split the stones. It's a move worth considering. With a stone at P15, though, it looks a little odd.]
