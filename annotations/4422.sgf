C[Given that both players here are absolute beginners this review may seem a bit harsh. It is not intended to hurt anyones feelings, rather to point the players in a direction that will help them improve. That being said neither white nor black played well in this game. Infact this hardly resembles a go game, this is nothing to feel bad about, as most of us who start without teachers start out this way. Go is different from other games like chess, where players can "teach themselves" the proper moves and stratedgies.... go has been played for thousands of years by millions of people who are a billion times better at understanding the game than most of us will ever be and we are lucky enough to be able to profit from the experiance of these great players. That being said I would like to start out by recommending some resources that both players can use to improve thier games:

1.) Keseido Go Server... has a more community oriented approach to playing online. It is relatively easy to find stronger players willing to comment, review, and play teaching games.
2.) Shygost's "The List" which can be found here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost
3.) 9x9 games are very appropriate for beginners and lead to a more firm grasp of the basics of the rules of go
4.) Beginners go books can be especially helpfull as they approach the game from an easier to understand perspective. I recommend "learn to play go" series volume 1
5.) senseis.xmp.net has quite a bit of information suited to begining players.
6.) gobase.org and goproblems.com are great sites for studying games and tsumego (go problems)

Ok so for the review.....]
(;B[po]LB[pp:1][qp:2][qq:3]C[No one could say this is a bad move. It is near a corner so its in the right area. but the 5-4 point and how to play it properly is more advanced, and I would not recommend playing any move that you don't understand, until you understand the basics as mentioned in "The List" (link at the begining)

Maybe a better move here would be the 4-4 (marked 1), the 3-4 (marked 2) or the 3-3 (marked 3) corner play; as these moves are easier to understand and work with later in the game (see variations to see what these look like) Within variations 1 and 2  there are tracks about the opening and fighting, I recommend finishing the main reveiw of the actual game before looking at these examples the review ends on the last move of the game.]
;W[do];B[pe];W[jj]LB[cc:3][cd:2][dd:1]C[This again is hard to call a "bad move" but it is one. it is important to remember the saying: "Corner first, Side Second, Center Last" this means playin the corners before playing on the side, and the side before playing in the center. this is center play white should play somewhere in the empty corner at 1 2 or 3]
;B[ji]C[again this is a mistake for black playing in the center while there is an empty corner is a waste of a move. especially this early in the game please follow the opening variation to see a more traditional opening and explanation. This move is bad for another reason: it touches a weak stone something you almost never want to do see "The List"]
;W[jh]C[This and the following moves are fighting and bad fighting at that these contact plays and ataris are wasting a lot of moves on the LAST territory anyone should want remember (Corner first, Side second, Center LAST) See the second variation from the beginning to see some examples of a basic fighting shape.]

;B[ja]C[this capture happened because white was not paying attention to two things 1.) how many liberties do I have, if a group has less than 5 liberties and is touching or being threatened by an opponants group, this group needs to be examined for weakness which leads us to 2.) reading... i dont see white reading here. when running toward the side you should be considering your move, how your opponant will respond to your move, and your next move. This is the very least amount of reading that should be done on EVERY move.]

;W[tt]C[In general both players need to remember the following:

1.) go is not a game about capturing stones, it is a game about surrounding territory
2.) Atari is generally a bad move and creates future weakness for the one doing the atari
3.) making actual eyes is not important, but having the space to make them is.

White needs to read ahead at the very least whites next move, how black will respond, and how white will respond to that, this should be done on EVERY MOVE. White also needs to pay careful attention to making sure his groups have enough liberties you should know how many groups you have on the board, and how many liberties each has before every move, also it is important to surround enough space so thatyour territory can be split in two (making two eyes)

Some of the things i said, and some of the terminology i used may not make very much sense right now, but if both players explore the links and other resources recommended at the begining of this review. Things will start to become clear. The main message here is dont get frustrated with only a small amount of study the concepts I presented here will see quite basic and easy to understand.]

C[As you can see black and white have played an almost even game up to this point. These are just loose projections of the territory each "could" possibly take in the future as well as the territory that each could possibly gain from thier influence on the center area of the board. Meaning this is most definately not marking actual territory that one controls "for sure"  if you try the "guess score" command under edit or the "score estimator" feature of your sgf viewer it will probably say white is ahead by a little...This is what the game of Go is all about.....  trying to  change this map in your favor for example.....]
;B[le]C[now the guess score sees black as ahead by a little or at least caught up to even... black did this by taking away a little of whites potential and increasing or solidifying his potential at the same time. eventually one side or the other pushes a little to hard and then you have a fight, sometimes this happens earlier in the game. in fact some pro games start out as one big fight, but for us amateurs who cant read 100s of moves ahead it useful to avoid direct confrontation and and look at the bigger picture. I hope this makes some sense.]

(;B[qp]C[fighting.... we are going to look at a very comon fighting pattern called the crosscut and some basic fighting principles for when contact fights do occur]
;W[pp]C[we are going to ignore some of the basic rules and look at this local situation only. Normally white would play in the empty corners first, and normally it would not be a good idea to touch the stone you are attacking etc...... but here we are just pretending like the board is 9x9 and all this is happening in the center]
;B[po]LB[qo:1]C[this is a hane, it is a very strong move when your stone is touched as now it is two black stones  with three liberties each against one white stone with only two liberties...... but the hane has a weakness (1) white can cut appart blacks stones]
;W[qo]LB[op:D][pq:C][qn:A][ro:B]C[white cuts and  now its two stones of each color with only two liberties each. but black moves next...... black might want to play at one of the points marked A, B, C, or D to put a white stone in atari but he doesn't right now. because black knows that in a contact fight you want to attack from strong shapes and neither of his stones are strong.... so black makes one stronger by.....]

Next is whites turn and he might be tempted to Atari at 1 or 2 but he doesnt because he wants to attack with a strong shape. White also notices stone B is in danger of being put in a ladder. If black were to play move at 3 he would capture this stone. If you are not familiar with the ladder, it is covered in the site senseis.xmp.net, just search for ladder.

So white decides to make B strong....];W[op]LB[op:3][po:A]C[so white plays at 3 doubling the liberties of this group. and threatening to put the black stone A into a ladder. (if you cant see the ladders..... its very important to look at the page about them and study the shape until you recognize it instantly. Anyway black must respond.....]
;B[pn]C[and now white must do the same....];W[ro]C[this shape is called the pinwheel from here  the groups that manage to gain liberties while taking away the opponants liberties will win the fight. The important thing to remember when fighting is it is usually more important to make sure your groups are safe than it is to try and hurt your opponants group. I hope this made some sense.]
