C[Dear Commentator,
although i won this game at the end of the midgame by killing a large group i felt this was a good game against me, because i was behind all the time. Black did in my eyes quite a good game and only gave me at very few points an easy game, but im not even sure about them.
I was very concerned about allowing the opponent to get (too much) influence at the wrong points of time maybe,  actually failed and came into trouble by having 3 weak groups.
 I would appreciate if you could name the general ideas that i missed or what the hints of the stones are to set ones priorities right when i failed to do so. I commented many of my moves to show what i thought of, i felt i did not control the game and am upset about it, thats why im critizising many of my moves (and i want to know where im right or wrong ;)

Thanx very much in advance, Martin  (im new to igs and just became 10k* there (only 22 rated games), im 7k* at kgs and consider myself as a solid 8-7kyu in germany)]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[pq];W[po]C[1st. thought: i think this is not standard move and probably not really good, but i saw moves like this in dans games and did not really understand when to play moves like this.
2nd thought: i chose this by accident because playing the same moves all time is boring ;)

This is a standard move, and is good.   If you take the other corner, black will make a shimari here.  Since he answers and
lets you take the 4th corner, it is as if you had played in the 4th corner on this move, and he had played next at n4 and let you approach.  This is clearly better for you than letting him have
the shimari.];B[mp]C[hm, i did not see a  forcing follow-up on lower right for me good enough and finally felt upper left to be more urgent again.

This black move is bad.  it must be in the open corner.  Once white plays in the open corner, he has a clearly better position than the common opening where white takes the 4th corner on his 2nd move.  This position is better for white since he has prevented the simari and made a nice extension from his upper right stone.]
;W[dd]C[somehow just hoshi. not good ?

This is fine.  It's a matter of taste to play here, or at c16, the
3-3 point.];B[nc]C[Not good.  Black should attack the white stone in the lower right, since it is outnumbered already 2 stones to one.]

(;W[jd]C[pincer to prevent too much influence. if this is the wrong side please say why, i had no feelings against that white move

The main idea here should be to end in sente, so you can go back and add a stone to the lower-right.   With a distant pincer, there are more variations, so it is more difficult to predict who will get sente.

Your move is fine though.];B[pb]C[a little submissive, i was happy.

yes, this is not good for black.  Usually he will play 3-3 or make a double approach.]
;W[nd];B[mc]C[Submissive again.]
(;W[oc]C[This move is not good.  usually it is bad to push into a knight's move unless you can cut on the next move.  A move like this strengthens black, with little compensation for you.

You should play at N16 to make a wall.];B[ob];W[qc]C[here,  R17 or N16 were the choices to me, but r 17 for black too good i felt and  white N16 is the move i normally play,but i wanted to try to play more safe. u might laugh now ;))
if you have a strong feeling and argument for N16 please say why and what dictates that move

N16 is better, since it make a nice wall of outside thickness.
When he plays at n16, is splits your wall, and it is sente besides. R17 is not safe, since he can atari and cut.  If your gorup is on the outside, and makes a strong wall, you are very safe already.]

(;B[md];W[ne];B[me]
(;W[pg]C[maybe i should have pushed once more with O14 but i feared to become too open and giving black an easy territory-erasing move around  Q12.

I would play at o14, or make a much longer extension on the side. Extend 2 points from a single stone, but you have a small wall here, so you can go further.]
;B[cj]C[damn, black looks good, i was too slow somehow maybe.

Your moves at p17 and r17 were slow.   They gave you very little benefit and let black push up into the center with sente.

Playing first on the big left side is very big, compared to the small territory you got with Q13 and R17.]
;W[qq]C[security first

right];B[qr];W[qp];B[oq]C[This is bad.  It should be at P2, to make the move
at S2 less good.];W[rr];B[fq]C[again big, i have no time to extend my right like kinda joseki and need to cut black and prevent him to get too strong

Very good for black, not to answer S2.  Black is getting a big potential territory in lower left.

The usual joseki extension in lower right side is to stablaize the group so it won't be attacked.  Since S2 was not answered,
this group is already stable, so the move on the side is just a big move, not so urgent.  Urgent moves have to do with attack and defense of big, unstable groups.]

(;W[do]C[i thought about how to reduce and was quite happy with this move, the worst case for me i thought would be black C5, white D4, black D3, then white lightly somehow.

This shoulder hit is unusual.  It should end up with black having a solid corner, and you with a weak group in the center.  It might give black too much territory.

I would prefer to invade and attack the group in the lower right, or to probe the corner, or to make a more distant shoulder hit.]
;B[co]
(;W[dp]C[This move is heavy.  Should skip up instead.  If black plays at d3, you only have 3 liberties, and black has kept the whole corner.]

(;B[cn]C[Black should block to keep the big corner territory.  Blocking also reduces white's liberties.]

(;W[dq]C[oh i was happy a little, black stronger but splitted

This is good for white in the corner, but white is also very heavy, so should come under severe attack.]

(;B[hp];W[kq]C[i thought again splitting the only move for me.

This is very dangerous.  You will end up with two weak groups on the lower side, and a splitting attack will come.

Your 3 stones on the left are extremely weak, and heavy, so your position on the lower side is bad.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[lp]C[that was too nice to me (white) , i thought at first, later i found myself only floating around weakly and began to like this black move

This black move is not good.  He should play L5.];W[jo]C[i was happy - i splitted black.  at a second thougt i see white much behind and lacking any base in both groups. but what did i do wrong ?

But black is also splitting you, and the black groups are stronger than the white groups.  What you did wrong was create a heavy group in the lower left, then make a second weak group without fixing up the first one.  The 3 stones in the lower left are heavy because they have no eyes, it is hard for them to run away and connect, and the corner is too big for you to sacrifice them.]
;B[hn]C[good.];W[cq]C[i became scared, black attacks both groups with that move  and i need to search for a base for life for at least one group to fight with the other.

black E2 woud be painul forcing move, good luck for me black omitted that .
black k3 secures large lower side i thought, but much aji for me and gives me some nice forcing moves. black omitted k3 also, i would have played it immidiatly if i was him. is black right ?

E2 is a good move that keeps you from getting 2 eyes in the corner, so it is a good attack.  I like j3 better than K3, since cutting at k3 just lets you get strong.]

(;B[pl]C[again much faster than white];W[qj];B[qn];W[pr]C[i chose this slow and gote securing move, i thought white needs to secure himself in lower right and any leaning against blacks Q8 R6 would make him stronger (i did only think of Q6 or O5 as an alternative to Q3) . again black  defines the game

When you have weak groups, your opponent will have the initiative. If you want to take the initiative, make strong groups, so you can attack.

Q6 would be bad since it strengthens black, without helping you much.]
;B[or];W[qs];B[pi]C[arrg

no, you like this move, since black is forcing to to take secure terriory in exchange for a bad wall, since you can come out in front of it at p6.]

(;W[qi]C[the only move for me  i thought, please correct me ;)

Once you play here, you have to continue with the next move to defend terriotry as well.  If you want to split black, you have to do it now, not wait a move.  Splitting right away leaves black weaker.]
;B[ph]
(;W[pj]C[no, i thought , i cannot play that easy and submissive with just R 12.
i felt i would lose the game when just playing R12, although black R12 would be great loss of territory

This is not good.  It gives up a lot of territory and leaves you with a very weak group.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[rh];W[nj]C[escape first];B[nh];W[rg]C[then save territory and stay secure in upper right.
at least ensure life neccessary, but now again a  run started. i felt not very well.

Very dangerous to take some territory when you have 3 very weak groups on the board.  With 3 weak groups, one should die.]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[ol];W[lj];B[mi]
(;W[nk]C[i hoped this was better than N 10, trying to prevent to play too simple. but actually its not better i think.

This is not good.  It makes an empty-triangle shape, and leaves a cut behind.  Just connecting is best, so you are out.]

(;B[ll];W[lk]
(;B[kl]C[Good splitting move, but peep first on lower side is better.]
;W[iq]C[damn, im too slow again, now i really felt bad. i thought that black could enclose at least one of the groups and since they are both in bad shape i need to rescue at least one
( and i wondered all the time why black did not play tha cut at K3 earlier )]
;B[hq]C[Sinve white's gorup above is also very weak, white should try to live on the edge first rather than running.  If white lives, then there is no double attack.]

(;W[jm];B[li]C[outch, now i became really afraid.

Yes.  One of your groups should probably die.  Black has a good double attack going on.]

(;W[ki]C[maybe wrong move.


Not a good move.  it leaves a cut behind, and it doesn't attack the stones above.]

(;B[jl];W[im]
(;B[hm]C[Black has a better move.];W[il];B[ik]C[Nice double attack for black, threathening to kill the two white groups.]
;W[hl]
(;B[fm]C[oh my gosh, both groups escape, that was close, he could have cut me off with L10.

but  F7  keeps blacks game simple and im still on the run,]
;W[jj]C[that was the move to escape, as i said, that was close. black could have ended the game by taking M10 instead F7 i thought.

Yes.  You put yourself in great danger by leaving 3 weak groups on the board.  Luckily black did not attack them very strongly.]
;B[jk];W[hr]
(;B[fc]C[well, black still in better position, but i became a little more confident to make it a close game when i find some good points in the infight. i did not attack strongly this stone at first because i did not see a real good point for attack and my groups still not save

i thought ignoring H2 and not playing G2 was mistake

Yes.  You will probably answer G2 to strengthen your lower side group, then your lower corner should die.]
;W[fe]C[This is good, since if black plays here, it attacks your stone at K16.]
;B[hd];W[jf];B[db]C[huu, black H 14 would have been real trouble for i thought, but blacks goes for profit.

H14 would be much better.  You probably have to make a move in the center, so black still gets to play at d18.]
;W[hf];B[nf]C[right, that cut for white was a danger for black, but i was too thin before and black chose the right point of time to secure
i saw the glance of a chance to calmly attack that whole black group]
;W[of];B[ng];W[lf]C[good peep.];B[mf];W[hi]C[well, i needed to take some profit and had to choose between somethin around C 12 C13 D 13 and this move (so that is what i thought)

my groups now more stable and blacks P8  and P3 N4 group could become a good target to attack after this calmer move, thats why i chose it]
;B[cg]C[well, admittedly big


Very big.]
(;W[cf]C[
This white move helps black strengthen himself.  Better to try to attack the group in the lower center.  I've shown a few possibilities. Your group in the lower left is weak, so the attack probably won't kill black...]
;B[dg];W[ej]C[black strong shape with D13, i hoped to destroy or cut off D13-group. but it did not work. Is here a good tesuji or something for white ?   i became more and more confident, although black could take easily large territories and with white calm plays black wins easy, but now all my groups stable and time to attack began. late, but not toooo late.  i was in the search of good tesujis,but, hmm, i felt black had strong shapes, though he should secure his center group]
;B[dl];W[gr];B[fr];W[er]
(;B[lq]C[ha, that was a securing move for his center but F1 just too good for white i thought.]
;W[fs]C[necessary to attack strong later on i thought

Good move.  This connects your stones and makes you strong.
And it worth a lot of points.];B[bc]C[again big

diagonal at c17 is better, to keep sente.];W[cc];B[cb];W[bd]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ac];W[ad];B[ba];W[ck]C[good luck that black played gote sequence]
;B[dk];W[ci]C[i hoped this was tesuji

is :)];B[dj];W[di];B[ei]C[damn

You can still capture the two stones with sente.]
(;W[fj];B[bi];W[eh];B[dh];W[fi];B[ch]C[left side big for black, but my turn now]

(;W[gc]C[I think just a diagonal move is bigger than this sacrifice.]
;B[gd]C[well, i did not see a good dan-tesuji, this did now work fully but black not too big afterwards]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[hb]C[This is not good if you are going to give up the two stones anyway.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb]C[The last two whie moves were excellent, making thickness to threaten the group in upper right.]
;B[ia];W[lb]
(;B[qb]C[ha, mistake.

If black answers correctly, he can live, but white is still a little bit ahead.]
;W[mb];B[nb];W[rb];B[pc];W[qd]C[haha];B[ra]C[wrong];W[sb];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[lh]C[too slow
now he almost dead, only chance around S12 maybe, but i did not see a chance for him]
;W[qa];B[og];W[pf]C[Black can try something inside the big white group, but it probably doesn't work.]

(;B[pk]C[now he dead.

This black move doesn't help any.];W[oi];B[oh];W[rl]C[attack both]
;B[kh];W[jh];B[ke]C[of course this cannot work];W[kf];B[je]
;W[ie];B[le];W[id]C[black resigned
he was also a little close in time right at this point, but dead anyway i think and resigning ok.

well. i won the game, but only by accident and because i calmly killed.
finally black still played the better game i think, without losing that group he would have won with save plays  i think,  still aji left with profit for white probably around N7 and a litte with the F3  F7 .. -group,  but black controlled the game most of the time in a solid and fast way and i somehow missed something very basic in the fuseki and middlegame. i became dangerous much too late.  Thanx for following this game, im sorry if i annoyed you with so many comments on my own.

Killing a big group is usually good :)  You made a good attack
on this big group.  In the beginning of the game you played thinly. You left several weak groups to be attacked.  And black got most of the big points.  So this left you behind.  But once you connected all of your groups together, you were thick, so you could make invasions anywhere, and finally you were able to use your thickness to kill a group.  The lesson is that it is good to be thick, even if you are a little behind in territory.  The group died becasue your surrounding stones were so strong that he had no forcing moves or counterattack.]
