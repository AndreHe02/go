AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Note for the reviewer :

The result fo the game is of litle matter.
My opponent probably played it soft on me. He did not debrief
the game afterwards.

I think overall, I did not play a too bad game, but relative
to my level, I don't see it as a "good" game.

What I tried to achieve here was to show some "spirit", and to
have my opponent enjoy the game as well.
I'm not sure I suceeded.

What I would like to know is :

1) where I missed important plays (like the ko in the bottom
rithg)

2) the rationale behind W moves, when a reviewer can see wht
I did not.

N: To begin, you opening moves should have more "spirit" - do
not let W dictate the flow of the game.  Many of your opening
moves are too defensive and W is able to take initiative and
slowly catch up.  If you attack and give W a hard time from the
beginning (Go is a fighting game), W will be hard pressed to
catch up and win the game.

I will say if your true strength is 11k, you played exceptionally
well!];W[jj];B[nq]C[Too slow for me.  A large scale move such as K4 or K16 is better.

W's first move radiates influence from the center and K4 or K16
will help reduce it.

BO3 doesn't even secure the corner yet.];W[cf];B[fc]LB[fd:X]
C[This is a classic mistake that weaker players make in handicap
games.  F16 is the move to play here - it is a fighting move
whereas F17 is defensive.];W[dm]TR[jj][cf][dj]C[White has his eye on the D10 stone - notice the large-scale net
W is making with his three stones.

W naturally wants to start fights and complicate the game seeing
as he is the stronger player.  W's tengen stone definitely will
come in handy with all the fighting that'll take place.];B[fp]
C[Good move...];W[jp]
(;B[cp]C[..not so good move.

Too slow and lacks initiative.  This is how W is able to catch
up in handicap games.

See variations];W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[Again, too defensive.  See vars.];W[ql]
(;B[qo]C[Not enough "spirit" :)  It is a weak attacking move and weak
at defending the corner territory (as you later found out)

See Var];W[fm]C[This would have been a nice place for B to play.  W is strengthening
his net.];B[kc]C[Why not M17?];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[qd]C[P18 is better - the area around R12 is open, so this side is
not as valuable.  It also allows W to get settled too easy. 
See var.];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb]
(;B[cl]C[Note for the reviewer :

This is probably bad. I strenghen W

Correct, and you weaken yourself too.  See vars];W[cm];B[dg]
;W[df];B[eg];W[ef]
(;B[ff]C[Wow, now that's spirit!  You're asking for a big fight with this
move :)

I think B F13 or G13 is good enough. See var];W[fg];B[fh];W[gg]

(;B[cg]C[You could also keep pushing at G12];W[cd];B[cc];W[be]

(;B[bg]C[my concnern here was to find a living shape for B

See Var.  B shouldn't worry about living shape yet];W[bc];B[cb]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[de];B[fd]C[B should just connect at D17];W[dc]
;B[db];W[fe];B[ge]C[Just play H15 right away];W[gf];B[he];W[ne]
;B[nj]C[I would play R9 first to make W heavy, then O10.  It also helps
defend against W's future move at R12];W[ck]C[W is seizing initiative by attacking B's weakest group.]
;B[cj];W[dl];B[bk]C[Not necessary at this time.];W[bl];B[ak]
C[not good at all.  B should not be playing on the first line this
early in the game.  W has also made some profit in sente.];W[qh]
C[W is now attacking B's other weak group]
(;B[of]C[Better to play at Q12 right away.  See var.];W[qj]
;B[ph];W[pi]
(;B[oh]C[Not good, see var];W[oj];B[oi];W[pk];B[li]C[W now has strong shape while B is a little heavy.]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[gq]C[W is getting to all the big points first.  B should have been
able to get to J3 first.];B[fq];W[gp];B[fr];W[lq];B[ol]C[Wasted forcing move]
;W[ok];B[lk]C[I do not understand this move - it is almost equivalent to a
pass.];W[le];B[mb];W[nb];B[mf]TR[mb][kc]C[another wasted move.  The marked stones are weak and need strengthening
such as K15];W[jd]LB[ni:X][mi:X][nh:X][mh:X]TR[lk][ol][mf][mb]
C[B's last four moves have made ~ 4 points total];B[ic];W[id]
;B[hd]C[Bad.  H17 instead];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb]C[Painful result for B]

(;B[rd]C[S16 looks very gote, but I was thinkng of a sequence begining
with N16.

Way too small at this point.  Unfortunately, B's only hope to
take control is to harass W's lower group.  See var.];W[qg]

S16 was not worth it at all]
(;B[od]C[M16 does not work now];W[ld]
(;B[mn]C[note :

I want to enter H7 zone where W will want to build territory

Then you should play around there.  B finally gets sente and
N6 is not good.  see var];W[if]C[W has essentially caught up.  I'm not sure the meaning behind
this move but there are bigger points for W such as Q6];B[kn]
C[You can play K7 instead];W[pn]C[antic [7k\]: see];B[oo];W[on]

;B[jn];W[go]C[No further comments made as the game is essentially even at this
point and W continues on, taking advantage of B's tactical mistakes.

not having a large group killed :)];B[hr];W[gr];B[gs];W[jr]
