C[A: Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and lost.
Any comments are welcome - especially general mistakes which I need to learn from for the future.

My questions are prefixed with "A:"

Thanks! Avi.

Jay: Glad to help. I will comment on both side, but focus more on the B side.]

(;B[dn]LB[dn:A][er:B]TR[do]C[Jay: This move is a bit slack. 

AA: My main questions are regarding this formation. 

1. You claim D6 is a bit slack, yet by looking into Gobase I found pros playing only this move and not E2.

2. Later you commented that H4 is too conservative, because E4 is protected by the ladder. My general question is that such protection could easily be removed by the opponent if he plays a ladder breaker - so should not H4 be regarded as 'honte'?

Thanks!

Jay: Joseki should always be judged by the whole board situation.  A (D6) is a joseki move. The question is if commiting another stone at A is interesting.  If UL corner were a B stone, then the D6 move would be more interesting.  As it is now, it is a W stone, thus developing this side is less intereting to B.  

The consideration here is to play consistently with a plan. When B played the marked approach, the intention is to stir up some fight here. If playing a normal joseki to settle peacefully, then the game is inconsistent.]
