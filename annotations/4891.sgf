C[Hi, thank you very much for reviewing my game! In my opinion, the beginning was good for me (Ba_alza). What i am especially interested in is how i should have played the Yose. I think i lost the game there...]

TR[mc]SQ[dj]C[You played A here, but since the triangled stone is low and the squared one is high, I would prefer to develop the left side instead (B).]
;B[hc];W[cf]C[Maybe its better to play at 3-3 at once!?];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[fe]LB[cc:A][cd:B]C[Since I don't like the result after WA, how about WB instead?!]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[gc];B[dc];W[eh]LB[dg:A][ch:B]C[BA seems to be what White wants. How about BB? It's not so easy to settle the white stones after that.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[cg];W[ch];B[cj]LB[bg:B][eg:A]C[Instead of WA, I would prefer WB.]
;W[eg];B[df];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[gf]C[Very optimistic :)]
;B[ge];W[hf];B[he];W[ie];B[if];W[kd];B[kc];W[hh];B[jf]C[This fight should be good for Black.]
;W[ke];B[jh];W[hj]LB[ii:A][jj:B]C[How about simply jumping out at B here instad of WA? Keeping White seperated should be enough.]
;B[ii];W[fj];B[hi]C[Too early.];W[gi];B[mg];W[md]LB[nc:B][nd:A]
C[WA should be at B, no?];B[nd];W[ne];B[nc];W[mf];B[ng];W[pe]
LB[od:A][qd:B][oe:I][pg:C][qg:D][ph:E][qh:F][oi:G][pj:H]C[I don't understand BA now. First of all, it's bad shape. Then, it forces White to connect.

If Black play just B instead (which is big in terms of territory, the cut remains. Maybe Black can play something like BC, WD, BE, WF, BG, WH later on, and cut with BI?!

Of course, the black stones in the center are weak... But still, if you want to play there, I think it's better to do it without playing the BA / WI exchange first.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[jl]LB[jk:A]C[i wonder if this move should better have been one point up.

Yes, A looks like the normal shape :)];W[jk];B[kk];W[ik];B[kj]
;W[kl];B[ll]LB[jm:A]C[Better to omit this atari and play BA instead, I think.]
;W[km];B[im]C[i shouldnt have tried that probably...

And giving up the cutting stone?? Never :)];W[lm];B[ml];W[mm]
;B[nm];W[nn];B[om];W[on];B[ok];W[mp];B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[lq]
;B[mr];W[lp];B[lr];W[jp]LB[gk:B][gm:A][en:C][iq:D]C[Your move at A seems to hard now. I think you gained already something at the right side, so it shoud be ok to play more safe, peeping at B and that jumping out at C. Or simply playing at D.]
;B[gm];W[el];B[en];W[fn]LB[em:A][ep:B]C[I didn't read it, but BB instead of BA looks interesting ;)]

;B[qk];W[og];B[lf];W[le];B[kf]C[This looks very small. Isn't the group alive without it?]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko]LB[io:A][gq:B]C[BB, not BA, seems right here?]

;B[fp];W[eq];B[hr]TR[fp]SQ[fr]MA[rr]C[this move better at x?

Yes. And, if you want to protect the squared stone, you shouldn't atari with the triangled stone.]

C["Take the ko once"! But there is nothing spectacular White can do here (If WA, Black fights the ko), so Black can fight the ko for real and try to win it.]

[ms][ns][os]C[You lost by half a point, but I don't think your endgame was weaker than White's... Of course, there were some small slips, but...

So, to sum up the game, I thing you could improve your game by not playing out the local situations too fast, and by looking on the whole board a little bit more, focussing on territory. My impression is, that during fighting, you don't think about territory?!

Anyway, tis was a fascinating game and I had fun commenting it :)

Good luck with your next games!])
