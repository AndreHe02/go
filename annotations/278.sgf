AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][dj][pj][jp][jd]C[Even though I won quite  comfortably, I am
wondering about a few things (that are
indicated at the respective moves).
However, the more comments I get the
better ... (thanks in advance)
one of the problems i usually have is
finding the big moves ...



Hi Tobias,

After a quick review of the game, I have the following comments. They will  be discussed in depth within the commented moves.

+1. You have a good taste for katachi (shape).
+2. You have a good sense of tenuki as well.
Playing elsewhere at the right time is very annoying for white, since he  wants to retain the initiative.

-1. You are not aggressive enough. You play defensive moves, which make it  very hard to kill your groups, but once the handicap goes down, you will  notice a lack of speed in your game, if you apply this passive style in  those games as well.

At times one has to defend, at times one has to attack. I will indicate at  which move your defence was rightly timed, or when it was overly passive.

-2. The most important principle in Go, as far as I'm concerned, and the  advice I give to all ('weaker') players, is :"Connect your stones".  Especially in handicap games, the hoshi stones are intended to be connected  and, once connected, influence the whole board. This doesn't mean you should  disregard territory, or slowly connect your stones, but it means that your  first intention should always be to connect your (important) stones (on a  large scale), and to cut your opponent's stones (on a large scale).


Some terminology:

D: means "Dieter starts his comments"
Var: variation

TL Top left
TR Top right
BL Bottom left
BR Bottom right
T,B,L,R sides accordingly.

If at move n, I say "Black 'a' would have been better, look at the  variation", a variation starts after move n-1

If at a move n I say "Black 'a', 'b','c' are now good answers" then the  variations start right after move n.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[dr]C[Probably too low. White should adopt a strategy based upon  'influence' and disregard territory in the opening  stages.]
;B[cq];W[cr]C[Crawling on the second line at the 3d move is a losing  strategy for white. In a handicap game, the jump into the center, the corner  approach (kakari) and the invasion are white's first moves, attempting to  split black's forces, hoping to get the upper hand in the fights or that  black will defend overly passively, so that white can wrest the advantage  away slowly.

Black on the other hand, tries to stay connected on a large scale, and  attacks the weak white groups, in order to get territory in a natural  way.]
;B[br];W[fo]LB[hq:a][nq:b]C[White doesn't have a base yet. You can  prevent his making a base now with black 'a', which is a good agressive move  . Black 'b', is a more quiet move, protecting the stone at k4, linking it up  more or less to q4 and already mapping out territory in the BR corner.



As for white, the jump at 7 should come first, leaving the 3-4, 5-6  exchanges for when it is necessary. Without them, white has still the option  to invade at '4']
;B[en]LB[dn:a][hq:b]C[Too passive. Your group is not in  danger at all.
2 and 8 could be replaced by 'a'. This one move would give you the sente to  attack the white group with 'b'. 'a' is the common move, instead of 2. It is  the move with the strongest capacity of connecting your hoshi stones.]
;W[mp];B[pm]LB[jn:a]C[You can also split white into two with 'a'. The double  kakari will prove not to be that dangerous.]
;W[jn]C[Good. White builds  influence and connects his stones on a large scale.]
;B[qf]C[White has  invested a lot in the bottom. You are mapping out territory quietly. This is  a nice way to win the game, but you are letting white have the initiative.  When you play more aggressively, you will learn more about go.
But 12 is more than OK. It shows that you can appreciate the value of  'tenuki' which distinguishes you of much of the 15 kyus in my  club.]
;W[nc]LB[fc:a]C[White 'd better approach at 'a' which is the widest  side.]
;B[pc];W[kc]C[Since making a wide base strengthens black,  white must  either make a small base with 'a', jump with 'b, or play  elsewhere.]
;B[jc]C[Very good !];W[me];B[of]LB[pf:a][cc:b][ji:c]C[The shape is good, but you invest a lot of  stones to secure your position.  With 8 stones it will indeed be difficult  to lose this way, but with a lower handicap you should speed up more. Again,  'a' would almost reach the result of 12 and 18 by itself.

'b' for instance, prevents white forever to take the corner. Globally, a  move around c cuts off the white weak group at the top from his bottom  group, and builds a moyo in the top left .]
;W[kd]C[Bad move. White is  heavy.];B[fc]LB[ke:a]C[Again, a slow territorial move. The proverb says: at  the head of two stones, hane. You should play at 'a' almost without  hesitation.]
;W[je];B[hd]LB[ie:a]C[You're too kind for white. With 20 as a  backup, you have no reason not to play at 'a' instead of 22.]
;W[qn]
(;B[qp]LB[pn:a]C[Connect at 'a' instead ! You let your stones be separated.  Against a stronger player, you'd better not seek the fight, but you take  your chance when it's possible to connect.]
;W[pn];B[no]LB[np:a][on:b]C[the  idea of this move was to stay
connected, conscious of the fact that j4
would become very weak. i guess at that
time i had to (or thought i had to ...) decide
whether to save (or try to) j4, or to connect
those stones on the right and keep w
small on the edge. would n4 have been
better?

D: Both of the moves 26 and 'a' strengthen white 9, and as such weaken your  stone at k4. With 24, you should have connected at 25, strengthening your  position and influencing the center, weakening white 9. With 26 you can  consider a hane at 'b'.]
;W[mo]LB[om:a]C[White should play the hane at 'a'  instead.]
;B[on]C[Good. Due to black 24, white will have a hard time  living.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk];B[qj];W[ro];B[rp]LB[oo:a]C[There is a weak point at 'a']

(;W[sm]C[T];B[nm]C[Good. Protects te weakness. Now white still has to make  an second eye.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rr];W[nq]LB[sk:a]C[You can now kill the  white stones at 'a'. Look at the var.]

(;B[oq]C[No need to defend. you are connected. A pity that you didn't take  the opportunity to kill white. The game would be over.]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[ql]
(;B[dg]LB[cc:a][cd:b][jg:c]C[With 20 and 48, you already invested a lot in  the TL corner, and still it is open for invasion, with a and b.

You should attack the group at the top now. While white is desperately  seeking life, you will make territory in a natural way.

That's one of the difficult parts of go:

Do not take territory when you can attack
Do not (always) attack to kill
Attack to make territory !

(;B[oi]C[The atari is wrong. 51 and 53 are cutting stones, but what do they  cut ?

;B[pb];W[cd]C[Now. These are the moments at which black sighs: "I  wanted to play there right now, and right at this moment he plays there."  That's why protecting the corner should have been done long  before.]
