AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[[tartuffe\]  To the reviewer:  I was just rocked in this game vs. a 6k.  I felt my opponent played a solid game without overplays whereas I created and left too many weaknesses which were then exploited by white.  This is the ideal type of handicap game to play, in my opinion, so I'd thought I'd ask for a review.  If you could point out shape problems, small moves, bad direction, mishaps during the fuseki, or anything else that makes you wince I would sincerely appreciate it!  Thanks for your time!]

(;B[qk]C[[tartuffe\] Is the following sequence acceptable?

Olof: Joseki is for black to push on more time before jumping.
See var];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[rl];W[ri];B[sk];W[rh];B[pk]C[[tartuffe\] My reaction was that white turned out better... black's corners still aren't safe and white has sente.

Olof: Yes as you jumped a little early white got a good result. But considering the initial error this is probobly the best black can do. Maybe you should have taken sente here, Q9 is not important, the black tenuki can take care of it self.]
;W[lc];B[mc]TR[kc][nc][me]C[[tartuffe\] N17 normal here?

Olof: If you watch high dan players they will mostly play n15 to make sure they are not sealed in the corner, if you want to attack the stone (not possible here) you play a pincer at k7, if you want to remove aji then the honte move is o17. If you are not afraid of the aji in the corner then this is a good move.]
;W[ld];B[ic]C[[tartuffe\] My idea here was to prevent a nice extension for white.   In hindsight I think F17 or G17 would have been better.

Olof: yes this is probobly a little too close to white. As he is more or less connected to the thick group on the right you could say that his two stones also are thick and the proverb is to stay from thickness.]
;W[fc]LB[dc:A][ie:B][df:C]
(;B[dc]C[Olof: I think you should consider jumping to j15 directly or first play d14 then jump. d17 is very submissive, it is sometimes seen but only then it is a severe attack in the white stone.]
;W[fe];B[ie];W[ig];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[kg];W[df]C[[tartuffe\] Two of my corners are almost sealed from the center.  I feel like my 4-stone advantage is quickly slipping away.]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[ce]C[[tartuffe\] Too submissive?

Olof: it's ok.];W[dg];B[dj];W[hf];B[lg];W[nf];B[jp]TR[kj]C[Olof: I think you need to jump into the center with the running group first. m13 was a nice move that made it possible for you too jump all the way to l10. This also puts a little pressure on the white group on the left as it still lacks defenitive eyeshape.]
;W[ji]LB[li:A][lj:B]C[Olof: Now it is white that attacks instead.]

(;B[li]C[Olof: You could probobly play m10 here. See var];W[kk]
;B[nj];W[qg];B[nl];W[cn]LB[en:C][cp:A][fp:B]C[[tartuffe\] I wasn't sure how to react to this stone.  I didn't want to pincer, since that seemed inefficient.  However, my D10 stone looks awfully lonely and swiftly comes under attack.

Olof: yes the problem here is that by attacking you white has made his group thick and 10 is now located too close to this thick white group. It's a hard call what to do. Maybe e6 or just f4]

(;B[cp]C[Olof: This is a very submissive move. It is almost only used then it's an sever attack on c6 (black being strong in the surrounding area). See same shape in upper left.

Note, an initial hoshi stone is aimed for influence not terr]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[ek];B[en];W[fk];B[gl];W[jr]LB[hq:A][jq:B][ir:C]
C[Olof: there are several different ways to answer this probe. The ones used most are attachments on either side and a push down to k3]

(;B[hq]C[[tartuffe\] Not sure what to do about K2 probe...]

LB[fq:B][fr:A]
(;B[fr]C[Olof: This hane is probobly a little premature. White will not have any problems living now anyway so extending one more time before playing the hane looks like a lot better shape.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[fq];B[er];W[jq]LB[bo:A][lq:B]TR[jn]C[[tartuffe\] Black has some weaknesses in the lower side.  When would it be prudent to play a solid move around there?

Olof: Hard to say. A move like k6 might be enough to remove most aji and could be made early as it isn't that overconcentrated. Perhaps you should induce it by playing m3, white l3 (who is now stronger) so defending at k6 becomes good)]

(;B[bo];W[bn];B[an];W[am];B[ao];W[bl];B[qd]C[[tartuffe\] What move best protects the corner here?

Olof: This looks very good. The corner should be safe now. Most other move leaves aji.]

C[[tartuffe\] Should have been R18.

(;B[od]C[Olof: Q17 is probobly correct];W[rb]TR[qc]C[Olof: tough  situation but I think r17 works better here, can't read out every followup.]

C[Olof: A little sad you lost the corner, I think you were a few points ahead before it happend. I think it's moves like d17 and c4 you need to work out of your system. This move is almost only used then you are strong enough in the surrounding area that it could be considerd a sever attack on the white stone. Also that extra jump into the center to make sure your running group is safe is often a good move. Even if it's not neccecary to live it will stop your oppnent from keeping up the attack while he is securing terr or building power.

I think you played ok most of the time. The joseki error in the upper right corner and the submissive play in the upper left (d17) was probobly your largest misstakes (sure the upper right corner dying was very big but things like that happens all the time for everyone.]
