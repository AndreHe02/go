C[Hello, I'm Thorre, playing around 9k in Germany and I'm your reviewer for today. I marked my comments, so you should be are able to identify them.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qe];W[nq];B[fc]LB[pn:A]C[Comment: This move I would take as hint for your opponents wish to seize initiative. Normally one would expect a black answer  around A, so this tenuki here emotionally could serve as first advice for your strategy: Play solid, dont expect quick victory, wait for your opponents overplays...]

(;W[jd]LB[cf:B][df:A]C[to stop the influence of the other two black stones

Comment: Answers at a A or B would be sente - so you could attack with double-kakari on the right black starpoint. Check variations.

Your answer lead to gote - since your opponent is probably an attacker u should fight for initiative.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[lq]C[Comment: Away from the point, that your opponent now was able to take initiative on the bottom, you are also faced with a unsatisfactory position at the top. Your stone at K16 is splitted from his allies.]

(;W[no];B[oq]LB[mq:A]C[Comment: This is a bad move you could answer at A. Check theoretical variation.]

(;W[op];B[pq];W[po];B[nr];W[qo];B[qp]
(;W[qj]LB[mc:A]C[too big jump?
i think i should have played at N17 first

Comment: Your extension seems good. Check variation if you had played at A.]
;B[qh]C[if i was black i would attack at M17 or J17]
(;W[mc]LB[hc:A]C[Comment: Seems wrong direction. The left black group is vulnerable, so it should be possible to gain power by attacking here around A. Check variation.]
;B[ic]C[Comment: The problem here is, that black now can stabilize his weak position while attacking your group. After securing his top left stones he will continue attacking your top left corner from below. This will weaken your left bottom star point too.]
;W[id];B[hd];W[jc];B[hc];W[if]LB[cj:A][gq:B]TR[jc][mc][id][jd]
C[bad move!
i should have put at D10 or G3

Comment: Really, since your marked stones are not in acute danger, you could decide for A or B. The move (white j14) seems slow. On the other hand, your tenuki here would probably invite further black attacks at the top...]
;B[cj];W[cm];B[cg]
(;W[cf];B[dg];W[ef];B[ff]C[now i was thinking of whether to move at E13 to come out of the corner or play a big move.]
;W[iq]LB[el:B][jo:C][cq:A][dq:D]C[decided to play a big move..hope this was correct.

Comment: Since the corner remains open for an invasion at 3,3 the point (A) and white´s potential influence could be reduced with moves around B and C, the move marked seems doubtful to me. I had probably decided for closing the corner at D.]

Comment: As explained black had reducing moves around A and B. So it is impossible to defend against both.]

;B[kn];W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[im];W[lo];B[ko]LB[oj:A][pl:B]C[what should be the next best move for white after this?

Comment: You could try to stabilize your side position with moves around A or B.]
;W[ln]LB[pl:A][rm:B][on:C]C[Comment: This move seems unreasonable. What doya want to accomplish? You cant hope securing much territory this way, cause your side position remains open for invasions at A and B or even vulnerable for attacks against your weak point at C.]

Recapitulating remarks: 

1. Always ask yourself for sente moves while attacking or defending.

2. Try to attack while defending.

3. Dont waste time playing small points

I hope you are able to improve your skill a bit with my comments. Regards, Thorre]
