C[Erik:
I was black in this game.
I am 4k my opponent 3k and the game was fought without komi.  I lost this game by resignation.
The game was dominated by a running fight between two dragons, where white got the oppertunity to start attacking my dragon first, ending in a ko that allowed him to settle his dragon while taking territory.  I feel that it was this that cost me the game.
Thank you for reviewing this game.];B[pd]C[Erik [4k\]: Hi

(;B[qh]C[N: I don't like this move as you already have a stone at Q9 which is sort of a loose pincer.

Attacking at S15 is better];W[qc]C[Black forces W into the corner and gives him instant profit - compare this to B playing S15 where it is B taking profit while attacking.]

N: It is a bit slow.  I'd play N15 if you're going to play in this area.  Otherwise I'd play F17]

Extending to N14 would be quite painful.];W[mf];B[ne];W[kd]
