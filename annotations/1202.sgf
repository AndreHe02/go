C[davec67:
I have only been playing for a few weeks and I didn't really know what I
was doing. Felt like I was mainly following black around the whole game responding
to him. It was a close game. I was white and Black wins by 3.5 points at
the end.  Would appreciate any hints/comments. Thanks

*A*: Hi!  I'm Alex Weldon, your reviewer.  This is my first review, so if I leave something out, don't hesitate to email me to ask a question.  Also, I'm double-digit kyu, so take all my comments with several grains of salt.  All my comments will be prefaced with *A* to distinguish them from your own.  Hopefully, they'll be of some help.  Now, let's see what we've got here...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[cf]C[*A*: This move is not wrong, per se, but it isn't what I'd play.  I would just play K4, because san-ren-sei vs san-ren-sei is supposed to be good for White in a game with komi.  Actually, just about any symmetric opening (Black and White have the same position) is good for White, because of the komi.  Black must break the symmetry in order to win, since he has to overcome the komi.]
;B[be]
(;W[dh]C[*A*: Kind of a strange sequence of moves.  I don't know many joseki (having taken the advice that studying joseki LOSES 2 stones strength), but I'm pretty sure this isn't one.  Black B15 seems odd, but I'm not sure how I'd punish it.

You end up losing a lot of potential territory on the left because Black pushes in under your stones, so maybe keeping him out with B14 or B13 would be better.

In cases like this, where the best play is not at all clear, maybe following the proverbs is the best idea.

Relevent proverb #1: Never ignore a shoulder hit (diagonally adjacent play, e.g. Black B15).  Nobi (firmly connected extension) is the usual response to a shoulder hit.

Relevent proverb #2: Pushing into keima is almost always wrong.  So C15 would be bad.

That leaves B14.  See variation.];B[pj];W[pl]C[*A*: This move is a little vague.  Because of Q16 and K16, Black is stronger here than you are.  You're threatening a combination splitting attack and moyo invasion around R13 or Q13, so if I were Black, I'd just play Q13 myself.  The result would be that you haven't gained all that much, have strengthened Black's moyo for him, and you'd still be left with a weakness at Q6 (and your san-san (3-3) point R3 is still wide open for invasion).

This game is quickly turning into moyo vs. moyo.  In such a game, you should look to see whose moyo is bigger.  If yours is bigger, keep expanding.  If his is bigger, try to reduce it.  Here, yours is looking bigger, so maybe you should have expanded and strengthened it with a move like K4.]
;B[ok];W[qn]C[*A*: Here you're spending a move to fix the Q6 weakness you created with the previous move.  This lets Black expand his moyo "for free".  Compare your territory in the bottom right with Black's potential in the top right and it's clear that these moves were not good for you.]
;B[rl]
(;W[jp]C[*A*: A big point, to be sure, but  Blacks last move created a weakness.  You might consider cutting at R9.  See variation.]
;B[bg]
(;W[dk]C[*A*: See, now Black can creep into your left side because you didn't block his shoulder hit.  I'm not sure what the best way to respond is, but I think this move is too high.  If you're letting Black in, you want to press him low and build thickness so you can start a fight around G17.  Maybe C11 is a good move here.  See variation.]
;B[ci]C[davec67:
at this point I thought I was doing quite well. Then I get stuck into a fight
with black around d12. Think I spent too long in it - how should I have played
differently ?

*A*: I'm not sure you're doing as well as you think.  Black has destroyed most of your territory on the left, and his top right looks HUGE.  Your three stones C14, D12, D9 are very thin... you should have managed to get some thickness here.]
;W[ch];B[bh]
(;W[cg]C[*A*: Empty triangle is almost always bad.  If you feel you realy need to connect, a bamboo joint (D14) would be better, but I don't feel that your C14 stone is really that important.  D11 would be a much better move, and might even be sente.  See variation.]
;B[di];W[ei]C[davec67: was trying to build a wall and lock him in the side

*A*: Much too thin.  Black can cut at E12.]
(;B[bj];W[fh]C[*A*: Good... fix the cut.  Maybe a solid connection at E12 would be better though... I don't know.  Black can peep at E13 and force you into yet another empty triangle.]
;B[fg]C[*A*: Strange move by Black.  Invites White to improve his shape at E13.]
;W[ej]C[*A*: ...or just ignore F13 and play here.];B[bk];W[cm]
;B[hh];W[ce];B[cd];W[bf];B[af];W[bd]C[*A*: Almost works, but not quite.  At your level, you could try to make a living group in the corner... could work if Black makes a mistake, but the variation shows Black's correct response.]
;B[ae]
(;W[ef];B[gg];W[fd];B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[ee];B[ge];W[ed];B[ec]
;W[fc]
(;B[bc]C[*A*: You gain a lot here, because Black plays some totally unneccessary moves, like this one.]
;W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[gb];B[ad]C[*A*: Another totally wasted move.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ie]
(;W[hc]C[davec67: this was a mistake - should I have played at k18 instead ?

*A*: Empty triangle is indeed bad.  K18 is better locally, but might be gote.  This is the time to tenuki.  His san-san point R17 is wide open.  It should look like a big red bullseye to you.  See variation.]
;B[jb];W[he];B[hf];W[hd];B[jf];W[gh];B[hi];W[pg]C[*A*: I like the aforementioned san-san invasion better.]
;B[ph]C[*A*: Terrible move by Black.  Never attack a stone by playing contact against it.  The standard follow-ups to contact plays make both sides stronger.  Remember this proverb: "Attack from a distance."

I would play R15, probably.  Makes san-san invasion less profitable (maybe impossible?  I can't remember what happens to a san-san invasion when the hoshi has a kosumi) and steals eye space from the Q13 stone.]
;W[oh]C[*A*: Hane is a standard response to a contact play, but here it's rather risky, and leads to getting cut apart.  I would play nobi at P13 or R13, or hane under the stone at R12, instead of over.  Keep in mind that the edge of the board is where you can make eyes most easily.]
;B[oi];W[og]C[*A*: Connecting is good.  If I were Black, I would have crosscut as soon as you played the hane.]
;B[li];W[qh]C[*A*: Another good move.];B[pi];W[qj]C[*A*: Not so great. See variation.]
;B[qi]
(;W[pk];B[oj]C[*A*: Possibly the worst move of the game by Black.  Why on Earth would he play that?]
;W[rh];B[qk];W[rj];B[ri];W[si];B[sj]C[*A*: Stupid move.  Black plays terribly in this exchange.]
;W[sk];B[rk];W[sj];B[sl];W[sh];B[qg];W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[re]
;W[qe]C[*A*: Good!];B[pf];W[rd];B[qd];W[se];B[pe]
(;W[re]C[*A*: You will need to do something here soon, but not quite yet!  Play S17 first and let him capture, but be careful...]
;B[ng];W[nh]C[*A*: These stones are probably dead.  Trying to save them just lets Black get stronger, so that you can no longer try to reduce his territory.]
;B[ni]C[davec67:
I sort of lost my way here - didn't know where to play. Wanted to try and
claim some territory in the middle and secure bottom right but somehow didn't
manage it - how should I have played ?

*A*: Build a gigantic moyo and force Black to invade.  K7 looks promising, but keep in mind that your san-san points are still open for invasion..]

(;W[mh];B[mi];W[ql]C[*A*: I don't think this move is necessary.  I think the black stones were already dead.  I may be wrong, though.]
;B[mg];W[mk]C[*A*: The eye-stealing tesuji.  Can be a good move, but not here, since Black's stones are already pretty much alive.  They don't NEED an eye.  It doesn't accomplish anything in this situation.  Black should ignore this move and invade C3, G3 or N3.]
;B[ol]
(;W[pm]C[*A*: Another empty triangle (actually, a farmer's hat here).  Totally unneccessary.  See variations.]
;B[nm];W[qc]C[*A*: Too small at this stage.];B[pc];W[pb]C[*A*: Obvious overplay.]
;B[qb];W[rc];B[ob];W[qa];B[pa];W[rb];B[ra];W[kk]C[*A*: What is this intended to accomplish?  Trying to save the N9 stone?  N9 isn't doing anything useful, so don't bother with it.  Don't throw good stones after bad.]
;B[on];W[oo];B[pn];W[po];B[rm];W[qm];B[rn];W[ro];B[om];W[qo]
C[*A*: This sequence was a bunch of "thank you" moves by Black.  Your san-san Point R3 is no longer open for invasion, and Black has not gained anything.]
;B[no];W[np]C[davec67: black creeps across my territory here - how could I have stopped it best ?

*A*: By strengthening your moyo earlier, instead of playing small moves elsewhere.   Since you didn't, Black can reduce considerably.]
;B[mo]
(;W[lo]C[*A*: Very bad.  Just invites Black in.  You should push along the fourth line for a while.  See variation.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[ko]
(;W[ln]C[*A*: Again, trying to save stones that should be sacrificed.  See variation.]

;B[im];W[il];B[hm];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[ik]
(;W[hl]C[*A*: Just capture him.  See variation.];B[jk]
(;W[fj]C[*A*: Again, empty triangle is bad.  Also, you MUST defend the cutting point at K8!  See variation.]
;B[jl];W[hj];B[ij];W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[bm]
(;W[cn]C[*A*: He has no stone at C8, so you can hane.  See variation.]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[fp];W[kq];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[pq];B[fo];W[fq]
;B[eq]
(;W[gq]C[*A*: Right.  Unfortunately, you do have to connect here.  See variation for what happens if you cut.]
;B[ep];W[dq]C[davec67: I feel I should have done better in this corner.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[fr];W[gr];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[ap]
;B[gs];W[hs];B[es];W[fs]C[*A*: This ko is too small to be played at this point.  Leave it for later.]
;B[ao];W[an];B[gs];W[bl];B[do];W[co];B[al];W[am];B[ak];W[dn]
;B[eo]
(;W[en]C[*A*: Very small gote move.  There are much bigger moves available.  See variation for what happens if you don't make this move.]
;B[nn]C[*A*: Black's move is -1 point in gote.  In other words, worse than passing.]
;W[gi]C[*A*: Okay.]
(;B[ii]C[*A*: I don't think Black has to defend.  See variation.]
;W[ib]C[*A*: Good!  Should have been taken much earlier though.]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[fs];W[hr];B[cs];W[bs];B[er]C[*A*: Black sees the connect-and-die.]

(;W[ds]C[*A*: This is what's known as a half-point ko.  Half-point kos are the smallest non-zero endgame moves there are, and so should be played last.]
;B[ia]C[*A*: This hane, for instance, is much bigger, especially since White K19 would probably be sente.  See variation.]
;W[ha];B[ja];W[cs]C[*A*: Again, filling a half-point ko is a tiny move.  You've now spent two gote moves to get one point.]
;B[de];W[df];B[da];W[ea];B[ca]
(;W[fb]C[*A*: Totally unneccessary.  -1 point in gote.  Worse than passing.  You should recognize that a point surrounded on 3 sides can't be used as a cutting point, because a stone played there will just be immediately captured.  See variations.]
;B[dg]C[*A*: Dame.  Zero points in gote.  There are still non-zero moves at G16, C9 and C10.  Actually, I realize now that C10 is better than C9.]
;W[cj]C[*A*: Good!];B[ck];W[dj];B[bi];W[cl];B[ig]C[*A*: Another -1 points in gote.  Terrible.]
;W[gd]C[*A*: Good!  The last non-zero move on the board.];B[sa]
;W[sb];B[qa];W[lh]C[*A*: Nonsense.  Black should just pass and your move would be -1 points in gote.]
;B[kh]C[davec67:
I knew that this sequence was doomed but I thought I'd see if my opponent
would make a mistake - probably cost me the game considering black only won
by 3.5. Is there a way I could have survived here ?

*A*: No way to live.  But as long as your opponent answers every move you make in his territory, you aren't losing any points.  Still, bad to play this way because a) if you play something that your opponent can ignore, you lose a point and b) it's rude to try something that shouldn't work because your opponent might make a mistake.  Everyone does it, though, at least at the beginner levels.]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[md];B[le];W[ke];B[ld];W[fn]C[*A*: Dame.  Zero points.  There aren't any moves left on the board.  Both players should have passed a while ago.]
;B[mc]C[*A*: Minus one point in gote again.  Worse than passing.]
;W[jr]C[*A*: Same.];B[nd]C[*A*: Again.];W[or]C[*A*: And again.]

[ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]TB[aa][ba][ab][bb][pb][ac][cc]
[bd][md][if][ag][hg][ah][ai][aj]C[*A*: Game over.    You seem to understand some of the basic concepts of the game, but you are lacking in other areas.   First: Know when to tenuki.  Many times, you get caught up playing small moves when you could have been taking a big point elsewhere.  As soon as a situation stabilizes, and there's no danger that you're going to lose a large number of points, you should start looking around the board to see if there's somewhere better to play.

Second: Don't defend things that don't need to be defended.  Doing so is -1 point in gote, and therefore worse than passing.  Both of you did this painfully often, as my comments show.

Third: Learn the san-san invasion: how to do it, and when to do it.  Both players this game had ample opportunity to jump in at the other player's san-san point, and neither did it, which probably indicates that neither knows it's even possible.  Read about it in a joseki dictionary, or on Sensei's Library.  It's really a valuable technique, and a well-timed san-san invasion would easily have changed the outcome of this game.  I gave a variation showing the basic san-san invasion, but you'll also have to learn to do it in the presence of other stones.

Fourth: Understand that most of the territory is along the edges.  The centre is deceptively small.  If your stones are high up (fourth line or above), be aware that the opponent can slide in under them, like Black did to you on the left.  Learn when to play a low (second or third line) stone to defend your territory from this kind of reduction.

Anyway, I hope this has been useful to you.  Again, if you have any questions, just ask.]
