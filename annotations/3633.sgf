C[Dear reviewer,

This game I played recently as part of the German Bundesliga. I played black in this game. I tried to play reasonable moves and use thickness. But that doesn't work well.
In the beginning I thought of a reasonable game with slightly better prospects for me. But during start of the middlegame all what I thought of prospects slipped away.
Did I make completely wrong assumption? Or is it because of my lack of reading ability. Or anything other?
Every comment is welcome.
I added some thoughts, which I had during the game.
I hope you can enjoy it a little.

regards
Peter (go4fun)];B[pd]C[[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked as [EV\]..]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[nc];B[pf]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[qk]LB[pn:B][op:A]C[[EV\] This move strikes me as a bit odd.  If you envision a straight-forward exchange of white A for black B, it would be better placed one space higher.  This would also make better shape with the upper group.]
;W[op];B[mp]C[[EV\] Good.];W[qq]LB[on:A]C[[EV\] The most common move for W is at A.  This move tries to settle the W stones quickly.]

(;B[rq]C[[EV\] Good.  See variations for other possibilities.]
;W[pq]
(;B[pn]C[[EV\] S5 would actually be a stronger attack on W, since now W can live anytime with S2.  See variation.]
;W[on];B[po]C[[EV\] I prefer Q7 or P7, to stay ahead in the pushing battle, despite the awkward position of R9.  B does not need to worry about a W clamp at R5, which can be answered at S5.]
;W[oo];B[cf];W[ch]
(;B[cl]C[g4: I was prepared to play this if white pincered, as he did.

[EV\] I don't like the strategy behind this move.  Picking a fight here is not likely to go well for B, since he is outnumbered 5-2 and will clearly soon have two weak groups. 

Breaking up the side is not urgent, since there is little W potential there anyway -- even an extra W move at D9 makes only 15 points with 3 stones, nothing to get concerned about.  

Note how W stays in control of the game from here on.  B never even gets a chance to come back to attack the P6 group.]
;W[bd];B[ef];W[fd];B[cr]C[[EV\] Better to settle the side first.  The W corner is not so weak, and this just provokes W to get stronger toward the side and center, where the main fight is located.]
;W[fo]LB[en:A]C[[EV\] A would be better shape and stronger, both for attack and defense.]

(;B[eh]LB[di:A]C[[EV\] B could try enclosing at A instead, to link the two weak groups and attempt to settle the side.  See variation.]
;W[cj]
(;B[ck]C[[EV\] This move helps W split the two weak B groups, making W play easy.]
;W[dj];B[el];W[fj];B[gl];W[ho];B[gp];W[fm];B[ek];W[ej];B[gk]
;W[dg]LB[hi:A]C[[EV\] I would prefer to run into the center, continuing to split the B groups, to attack on a larger scale.  Note that W has a connection at B14 as an alternative to  this sequence, so jumping as far as A is possible.]
;B[df];W[eg];B[fg];W[ff];B[fe];W[gf];B[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[fc]
;B[ge];W[gg];B[ie];W[hd];B[he];W[ig];B[ke];W[jd];B[je]C[[EV\] Even though B managed to break through, W made territory while attacking, and the B group is still a liability.]
;W[hm];B[ik]
(;W[kp]C[[EV\] I think it would be better for W to continue to play thick attacking moves.  B gets a good chance to counter-attack now.]

(;B[jo]C[[EV\] Good.  B must fight back.];W[lo];B[jm];W[jp]
;B[ip];W[io];B[ko];W[lp]
(;B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[ep];B[go];W[gn]C[[EV\] F6 would be safer, capturing two stones cleanly, giving up two stones on the outside.]
;B[fn];W[fp]
(;B[gq];W[dn];B[bo];W[bm];B[bj];W[br]LB[kk:A]C[[EV\] Let's assume B defends the center around A and pause here to count.  W has 16 pts lower left, 14 pts lower right, 28 pts top, 10 pts center.  B has 6 pts lower left, 14 pts lower right, 12+ pts upper right.  To win, B would have to make an extra 30 pts on the right side, which seems impossible.]

;B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[mf];B[le];W[eb];B[kh];W[pi]LB[og:A][ol:B]
C[[EV\] Given our earlier count, W has no need to risk invading this deeply.  Simple reductions around A and B would win safely.  S2 is worth around 20 points in gote.]
;B[oh];W[pk];B[ql]C[[EV\] This was the last chance for B to try to capture these stones.  W seems likely to connect or live, but why not try anyway?  Once this invasion succeeds, the game is over.  No more comments.]
;W[ol];B[qh];W[qi];B[gh];W[fh]
(;B[fi];W[gi];B[hh];W[ei]C[g4: I think there is nothing interesting byond this move. I tried to fight, but I had had clearly no more chance.]

(;B[gm]C[[EV\] B could go for this exchange.];W[hn];B[dm];W[gq]
;B[hp];W[gr];B[hr]C[[EV\] B captures the center but loses the corner.  However, the corner still has a lot of aji (B3 leads to a ko?), and B gets sente to make territory on the right side.]

(;B[bo]C[g4: This came into my mind

[EV\] This would be a much stronger attack on W, gouging out his eye space.]
;W[co];B[bn]LB[bp:A]C[[EV\] B could also play A, breaking W shape, and still connnect on either side.]
;W[bp];B[bm];W[dq];B[eq]))
(;B[kq]C[g4: T thought of this but the reasonable continuation didn't look appealing to me. White would have connected all his weak groups.]

(;B[di];W[ci];B[dk]C[g4: I thought about this

[EV\] This would be a better sequence, making use of all the stones.  I guess W will still cut and have an easier time in the fight, but this gives B some fighting chances.]

(;B[di];W[dh];B[eh]
(;W[ci];B[dj];W[bf];B[dg]C[[EV\] W can connect underneath, but B settles his weak stones nicely.]

(;W[ei];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[ej];W[fi];B[fh]C[[EV\] This leads to a complicated fight, with reasonable chances for B.]

(;B[cc]C[[EV\] This is the simplest choice, and the continuation looks OK for B.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[eg];B[jd]C[[EV\] B has a nice reduction move.]
))
(;B[ro];W[on];B[pm]C[[EV\] This would be normal without the stone at R9, which again looks a bit awkward.  Still, if W keeps pressing, I think B turns out all right.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[pn];B[qm];W[nl];B[ok];W[mm]C[[EV\] This result might be fair for both sides.  W is nearly settled, but B has a nice territory above.]
