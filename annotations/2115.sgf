(;B[ph]C[Bramgo: white plays a bit agressive but still very solid. The mistake you made is not being solid enough.

(;B[mj]TR[pg][nh][nj][pk]C[Bramgo: It looks as if you tried to get both sides but both sides look really weak. Especially those 4 cutting points look really dangerous. Playing a little more solid would be better

BramGo: 
Letting white access the center is unavoidable. But still both sides p12 and q10 look really weak I think O12 would be a big move or somewhere around Q7]

;B[rb]C[BramGo: good job];W[qe];B[pe];W[od];B[rc];W[nh]C[i did not think that playing at o13 would have helped, seeing that he could then just constantly cut and atari splitting my stones apart, that's why i played the next move]

A: Seal the center. Is very big
B: White will propably reply with C8 after that you can play  D9 again and build a little bit of influence and maybe even cut at c10.... (see variation)
C: gain some territory there
D: looks very good . Makes the white group unsettled reduces his territory and extends your territory.]
