C[This is typical of a lot of my games lately. Vital reducing groups become=
target of attack and it all gets out of control!

Paul,
 I will try and comment on what I see as errors in direction and overplays.  Certainly a stronger player may have other insights I don't, but that is the nature of this game!

My comments will be preceded by "DS:" I assume from the info I recieved from the GTL that you, Paul, are white.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[qp]C[DS:  First off, this looks wrong to me.  A play at Q3 or Q4 seems better as Black can easily play at P4 now and it is an ideal move being both an extension and an approach move on the corner.]
;B[ce];W[oq]C[DS: Ok.  it is playable, but I like K16 or K17 better.]
;B[dj]C[DS: B misses a chance to play a big move at K16.];W[fq]
C[DS: K16 bigger.];B[hq];W[fo]C[DS: In principle, jumping out here is not recommended.  Usual joseki here are C3 or H4]
;B[dn];W[dr]C[DS: Usual move is J4 first.  Playing D2 now eliminates the possibility of jumping into the corner at C3 if needed later.]
;B[cq];W[ip];B[hp]C[DS: Usual is to play J3 first.]
(;W[ho]C[DS:  See previous variation.  I think W should play J3 here and punish B.]
;B[io]C[I wasn't quite sure what to do with this variation from the joseki. This stone (17) turns out to be real trouble!

DS: I agree.  This creates a lot of confusion and immediate fighting.  The usual move for B here is J3.]
;W[iq];B[go];W[hn];B[gp];W[hr];B[fp];W[gr];B[gn];W[hm];B[gm]
;W[hl];B[qj];W[gl]C[DS: Ok, good. But I think W can't ingnore B's cutting move at J5.]
;B[fl];W[cj]C[DS:  This seems much too deep.  W has weaknesses at J5 and has not answered B's R10 move yet.  Too early for this kind of move.  I might think more of a move at Q9 or cap at P10.  However B plays after that W will get a nice wall and power for later use. Anyway, C10 is bad now.  At the most I would consider F9 amining at D11 or E11 later.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[cl];W[ci];B[bg];W[bh];B[bk];W[cg];B[bf];W[bj]
;B[bl];W[di]C[DS:  now you will see why this move was wrong.  W had sente and wasted it on trying to live on the left.  The old proverb " Live in gote, die in sente" applies.  W can live a small life here, but B then gets sente to move on the right side. I think B clearly gained the advantage now.

However, this group actually still is not settled.  B can remove W's eye at the edge by playing A11 and then W will have to run away toward the center.]
;B[qf]C[DS: Big play.];W[nd];B[oh]C[DS: odd move.  S16 stablizes the group better.]
;W[ql]C[DS: I'm not sure about this.  I am very nervous about B's J5 cutting stone.  W needs to play K5 to protect that cut, and this would firm up the territory at the bottom too.]
;B[nl]C[DS: another odd move, though it does seem to work with J5.]
;W[jc]C[DS: Big move, but as before there are major weaknesses for W while B is pretty secure.]
;B[jo]C[DS: This is a good move too.  It cuts off the white H8 group now.  K5 would have been better than playing R8 earlier.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[lo];W[hh]C[DS: a little too far.  I think a move jumping out to H11 or G11 would be better here.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[pl];W[qm];B[pm];W[je]C[DS:  The H8 group is still not secure.  F8 or G11 would secure it I think. Also, a move like K15 does little for the top. It think a move at G17 would be stronger. However, W also still is weak in the upper right corner.   A move at S15 or R16 would really be nice now.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[jp];W[jq];B[qc]C[DS: B invades.  Good timing.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb]
;W[sb]C[DS: Unless you are sure you can kill this group, (which you can't) it would be much better to play safe at G17.  Reseve moves like this to use as ko threats later if needed.   W is seems ahead on the board, and securing the top territory would help the lead.]
;B[rb];W[db]C[DS:  too agressive.  Just G17 would be ok i think. Be very cautious of contact moves like this.  Contact plays almost always create walls, as you will see shortly.]
;B[cb];W[eb];B[ec];W[fc];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[he]C[DS:  B gets to drive right through W's top. Furthermore, B's wall now threatens to attack W's weak group C11.  Now you can see that D18 was wrong.  It just helped B and did very little for W.]
;W[id];B[ee];W[km];B[lm];W[kl]C[At this point I didn't think things looked too bad. I just needed to make the left group (around 36) and the middle group (around 98) live.

DS:  It seems pretty close now.  If there is komi, W is ahead i think. A move to secure H8, would be important, but I think moving at C2 would be huge now.  Also W can play at S12 or T12 and erase any potential territory for B on the right side.  Also a move at J15 would be big for both sides, but I think moving at C2 followed by J15 or something on the right would be better first befor this move at L8.    More importantly however, is that W has two very weak groups H8 and D11.  So the balance of territory is in danger for W.]
;B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[hi]C[DS:  W's H8 group now coming under attack.  Difficult for sure.]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[gh];B[ij]C[DS: B creates a double attack. Very powerful move.  It is this that wins the game.]
;W[kj];B[ih];W[hf]C[DS:   W must run for it now.  peep at K 11 then jump to L13 would be the only way i can see to save the H8 group.  But as both groups are weak, W will certainly lose one of them.]
;B[kh];W[ji]C[DS: This peep now is too late.];B[jh];W[ii]C[DS: :nonsense.  This does nothing at all]
;B[hj]C[At this point I realised that t=
hings were looking very bad for the middle group, and things started going =
pear shaped!

DS:  yes, W has little hope.  Now both groups are very weak and certainly one will die.]
;W[op];B[no]C[DS: I don't see why B doesn't play P5.  I don't think W can do anything afterwards because of B's M7 and O8.]
;W[oo];B[nn];W[mh]C[DS:  nonsense.  W cannot escape now.];B[li]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[ni];W[nj];B[oj];W[ll];B[jk]C[DS: This move is silly.  But, W is trapped and I do not see any way to make 2 eyes.]
;W[jj]C[DS: nonsense.];B[ik];W[kk];B[mk];W[jl];B[fk];W[mm];B[ln]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[pk];W[qi];B[qk];W[nm];B[on]
;W[qg];B[oe];W[od];B[pf];W[mf];B[rf];W[mn]C[Now I pretty much knew the game was over and made desperate attacks on black groups.

DS:  It is bad to play hoping only for your opponent to make a mistake.  You should always try to find the best move.  At this time I agree, the game is over.]
;B[mo];W[cr];B[br];W[bp]C[DS: nonsense.  B1 would be the only move.]
;B[bq];W[co];B[cp];W[do];B[bo];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[dq];W[cn]
;B[dm];W[cc]C[DS: again. nonsense.];B[bb];W[bc];B[bd];W[dd]
;B[ed];W[cd];B[de];W[ca]C[DS: very bad move.  When B plays B19, W cannot connect at D19 or he will lose it all with F18.]
;B[ba];W[ge];B[se];W[bn];B[ap];W[bs];B[ar];W[er];B[rl];W[rm]
;B[sl];W[sm];B[rj];W[il]C[DS: nonsense.  W can do nothing.]
;B[ne];W[me];B[kf];W[ke];B[mg];W[lg];B[ng];W[lh];B[lf]C[DS: W just gave away 6 points.]
;W[le];B[jf];W[if];B[ki];W[fj]C[DS:  these moves are worthless. Only good as ko threats.]

;B[ri];B[as];W[cs];B[ca];W[he];B[fe]C[DS: Over all, both sides missed key points, but B won because of the double attack at the center.   W's main weakness was having two weak groups that B could attack at the same time.  That is clearly where you lost the game.    You may play desperation moves hoping your opponent will blunder, but you will not improve your strength by doing so.]
)
(;W[iq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[kq]C[DS: W may lose the three stones but W has firmed up the bottom nicely and B's H4 group is weak.]
