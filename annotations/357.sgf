C[I played white in this game.  I lost by a fairly large margin,
but I felt that my opponent and I were more evenly matched than
the result suggests.  Please comment on specific good and bad
moves as well as suggesting general areas to study.];B[pd]CR[pd]

;B[cp]CR[cp]LB[cq:A]C[This black move is not good, as it lets white take the corner in sente.
Better move would be A.];W[cq]CR[cq];B[dk]CR[dk];W[nc]CR[nc]

[kb:C]C[This move is bad, as it helps black to split the two white groups apart.
The sequence white A, black B white C is most common in this situation.]
;B[pc]CR[pc];W[kc]CR[kc]C[now white has no basis for his group and has to struggle for life.
This makes black stronger and helps to get a large framework at
the upper left side.];B[jc]CR[jc];W[lc]CR[lc];B[jd]CR[jd];W[qd]

;W[ng]CR[ng]C[This exchange doesn't seem to have come out well for White.

Yes, now black has a solid corner at the upper right side and  a large framework at the upper left side.
The game is allready difficult for white.];B[qi]CR[qi];W[ql]

CR[oi];W[cg]CR[cg]LB[cc:A]C[Is this the best spot to invade?

In my oppinion the best would be to invade at A.
There is a good chance to keep sente and then attack the  black group at the lower side.
Attacking at the lower side immediately is also ok.];B[ci]CR[ci]

Better attack at A or B.];B[jb]CR[jb];W[ld]CR[ld];B[kg]CR[kg]
C[Now blacks area enlarges.];W[no]CR[no]LB[or:A][mr:B]C[Better at A or B to keep black without a basis.]

;W[mp]CR[mp]LB[lp:A]C[Is this the best way to keep pressure on this black group?

Well, the black group now is allmost alive.
The best way to get profite while attacking seems at A.];B[mq]

;B[mm]CR[mm];W[nm]CR[nm]C[I was very pleased that I got to run up the side like this and
make territory.

Seems ok for both sides. Black mustn't be enclosed at the lower side.]

Well, this seems to deep. But maybe it is whites  last chance.]

CR[jj];W[ii]CR[ii]LB[hl:A][il:B]C[Should I have played here or given up the four stones and played
around h8?  Is it already too late to save the center stones?

No, just give the 4 stones and play at A or B to save the rest.
But anyway, even if you can rescue all stones black has more
territory.];B[hl]CR[hl];W[ik]CR[ik];B[il]CR[il];W[jk]CR[jk]

;W[in]CR[in];B[kk]CR[kk]C[White resigns
Black wins by about 80 points.

Well, there was not much to say about blacks moves.
Whites almost every time played stones that were more
helpful for black than for himself.

The only difficult position for black was at the lower side.
If he plays there earlier and stabelizes the stones there,
he will have no problems within this game.

The white stones are quite scattered over the board.
The 4 groups are just making territory be themself and
do not work together in any way.

This is a point white should work at.])
