C[Up to that game I mainly played 13x13 games. I'm still rather lost on 19x19 and I'm seeking for comments about my game, mainly during the opening of the game.
my main impression is I (black) was lucky at the initial balancing of territories during the begining of the game.
Usually, I often get into troubles by getting pinched or having to fight an heavy fire at every stone I put.
Why in this game was the begining so balanced for me ? this is my main question about that game, maybe white's play has the answer, but I don't understand when and where.]
;B[qd]C[Hello, my name is Darrell.  I am about 6 kyu AGA.

I have read your opening question and other questions throughout the game.  You ask repeatedly "why did white do this?  Why did white let me have a peaceful opening.  Why did white let me cut..."  I can't answer these of course.  You would have to ask white.  

Rather, I can review the game as played.  Which I will do as best I can.  Since your primary interest is the opening, I will concentrate there.

You may send me any followup questions you might have and I will try to answer them.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]LB[oc:a][od:b][qo:c][po:d]C[Ordinarily, since you have placed your first two stones on the 3-4 points, a move at a,b,c or d would take priority over approaching a stone on the 4-4 point.  This is not a major point, but worth noting.]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[oe];B[pf];W[md];B[ld];W[me];B[jd];W[nh];B[ph]
;W[nj];B[pj];W[nl];B[oo]LB[gc:a]C[this is a rather unusual stone from me. a thin step toward the center whilst trying to claim for territory... on both side ?
when reviewing the game I even wonder if it wasn't a false click !

White has been very passive, letting you build territory on the 4th line.  At this point, your group on top is rather weak and subject to attack.  Rather than this vague move that doesn't really attack or defend anything, I would move around 'a' and strengthen this group.  It also puts some pressure on white's top left.]
;W[dn];B[fo]LB[jp:a][dr:b]C[Another very strange move.  'a' or 'b' are normal and better.]
;W[hc]C[Good move by white.  Attack's your weakest group and profits in the corner.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[hb]C[I've had so many sides killed those last time that I rather prefer building some wall quickly than trying to get some air from the middle (that might never come)

It is very early in the game to have to play on the second line.  This is a losing strategy you have outlined.  Getting surrounded and then having to make life is strategically very bad.]
;W[gb];B[ib];W[pl]LB[le:a]C[White should continue to surround and punish your little group.  You can't ignore such moves lest you die, so white will still get to make the first move elsewhere.]
;B[qk];W[eq]LB[jp:a]C[White helps you here.  More interesting would be to jump in and split your groups.]
;B[jp]C[up to there I played rather conservatively, I still wonder if a shorter move wouldn't  be more interesting (closer to F3-5) ?

No, this is good.];W[mo];B[mq]C[I even feel lucky it seems to work ?]
;W[eb]LB[le:a][fm:b][cj:c]C[??????  White doesn't know what do do, so basically just passed.  Some ideas are marked.]
;B[cf];W[be]C[here I still wonder why I haven't been pinched ? I'm usually very bad when pinched]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[bd];B[dh]LB[cj:a]C[again : strong walls rather than blury territory, but the price is
 - smaller territory
 - steady walls also for the oponent

This is much too narrow.  Should be played at 'a'.];W[cj]C[Good.  White takes the spot and squeezes black into small life.]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[fr];B[ep]C[I'm trying to push for a conservative answer at D2 or somewhere behind this diagonal of white stones...

You were very fortunate in this corner.  Look at variation 2 for a more sensible line of play for white.  White simply handed you the corner for no reason.]

(;W[gr];B[do]C[I insist, though I'm loosing a lot of territory at G2]
;W[co];B[eo];W[cl];B[dq];W[er];B[cp]C[I still don't
really get why I could go toward the corner here

You shouldn't have been able to.  This is my last comment in the game.]

;B[fj]C[this another "right in the middle" move (that I usually don't play), I played here mainly because I felt white would play here after...]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[mk]C[Another "pass" move from white.];B[di]C[here againg, I don't understand why white accepts the cut]

shall I thank the L5 stone that brought me initiative when white had to defend at M7 ?]
