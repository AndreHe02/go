C[yip:
C7 isn't a good choice for black.  It seems indecisive, as though black doesn't know which direction to continue in.  White can take control here...]

(;W[dq]C[yip:
This is a bad followup for white.  The corner is small here, and the white stones aren't weak, so there's no need to play a completely defensive move like this.  Imagine the order were changed, so that white played D3 in response to E3, and then black responded with C7.  White surely wouldn't play D5 in that case!]
;B[ep]LB[eo:B][iq:A]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Would it be better for white to play at E5 here and then attack the stone at C7 with a pincer?


yip:
That's the right idea; keep the black stones separated and weak.  Playing at A right now is too soon, since there's not enough white support to put together an effective attack.]

(;W[iq];B[dp];W[cq];B[eo]C[yip:
Black would have been much better off not even playing D4 in this case.  If you're not going to cut, there's no reason to take away one of your own liberties - white's certainly not going to take D4.]

(;W[mp]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Here I thought that a white kakari against the Q17-stone might have been bigger than what I actually played (N4). On the other hand, a black invasion against my J3 stone would have been unpleasant.

yip:
This play doesn't really do anything for white. The corner is still completely open, and black can also invade at L3 if the E4 group gets a little stronger.  It's a move that tries to solve two problems, but each only halfway.]

(;B[jd]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I guess making a shimari would have been better for black here.]
;W[qe]C[yip:
This play doesn't seem right.  The bottom left is still unsettled, and this invites black to play P15, which expands the upper moyo, flattens white against the side, and leaves all of the previous invasion points available for black.]
;B[qd]C[yip:
Very bad; why strengthen this stone?  It also allows white to naturally make an angle play against black's group.]
;W[pe];B[nc];W[qi]C[yip:
White can be quite happy with this outcome.];B[qq];W[qp]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I decided to block from this side, because that forced black to invade my right side moyo. I was hoping to gain some profit in the ensuing fight.

yip:
Correct.  This is a major mistake by black, since now the R11 stone will be in the perfect position!]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn]
;B[pi]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Here was the invasion I was hoping for. At first it seemed to be quite challenging to take advantage of it, but black played some helpful moves and I was able to make something out of it after all.

yip:
You could even consider attacking on a much larger scale, since you're so strong here.  O15 is one possibility that not only attacks indirectly, but also cuts down black's potential on the top.]
;W[ph]C[yip:
This isn't so good, since white leaves a cutting point to aim at.]
;B[qj];W[oi];B[pk]C[yip:
I'm not sure what black is trying to do here.  Maybe it was a misclick?]

(;W[oj]C[yip:
White should just capture; the exchange is totally in white's favor up to this point.]

(;W[oo];B[pn]
(;W[no]C[yip:
The last two white moves were extremely submissive - what did they really accomplish?  The thickness white had is now totally wasted...]

(;W[nl];B[pj]
(;W[nn];B[rh];W[rf]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I don't know why S13 seemed so dangerous during the game. I think black would have been in serious trouble if I had played S13 instead of S14.

yip:
Black's been dead for several moves now...];B[qg];W[pg];B[rg]
;W[rd]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I thought it best to let black live and try to invade the corner instead.

yip:
But black's dead here.  Q8 is only an eye after black plays R9 and then wins a ko.  And there's no place to get a second one in sente...]
;B[qf]
(;W[qc];B[qk]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Considering that it is not possible to shut black in without an additional white stone at Q14, I think it would have been wiser for me to play there and let black make eyes on the side.

yip:
Even now, black's not alive with another play.  White should've killed earlier, but if it comes down to a ko fight, white should just capture at Q16 to get rid of any threats there, secure a large profit, and at least get some compensation.]

(;W[sj];B[pf];W[pd];B[oh];W[og];B[of];W[ng];B[ne]C[[Tuhkelo\]: At this point I decided to attack the four black stones at the bottom. I thought that if black pushes himself into safety through the center, I might make territory on the left side.]
;W[dn];B[cn]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Black threatened to cut me off, but I didn't let that stop my attack. Now I was seriously after the four stones below.]
;W[en];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[fn];B[go]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I guess connecting at C5 would have been best at this point, that would have put more pressure on the two stones at C6 and C7. Black would have been in trouble on both sides.


yip:
Black gets several forcing moves against the corner as well after C5, which help both groups.]

[Tuhkelo\]: I think it was far too early for black to resign, considering the sequence A6, B5, A8, and the ensuing ko-fight. Both sides have lots of ko-threats, so the continuation would have been interesting.

By keeping the groups separated, white doesn't give black the chance to do anything.  Whichever way black tries to extend or push weakens the other position.  If black invades around O3 at this point, then that gives white another weak group to go after.]
