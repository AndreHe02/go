C[toiminto [26k\]: hello
Hicaru [26k\]: hi


At first I'm no good in English

My question is
   Why i lost i think i play well?
   please give me some tips of attack

** Hello Hicaru, I'm Paul your reviewer. ("illume" on KGS.)

I liked your game because neither side made obvious mistakes. I think you lost because you tried to save all of your stones instead of making a lot of points.
In my opinion it should be easy for you to learn that you don't have to rescue one or two stones if you don't need those stones.

When you start to see which defense-moves aren't necessary you'll be able to make more attacking moves. I pointed out some opportunities that you missed but I'm afraid that this won't improve your attack-skills in other games. It's very difficult to see which groups are weak and can be attacked. I suppose everything you need right now is more experience.

Just try to avoid attacking moves that give up the initiative. If your opponent can easily find an answer that gives him the initiative back,  then consider other moves first.]
;B[dd];W[pq];B[dq];W[qd];B[dn]LB[oc:A][pl:C][qo:B]C[** Now the corners on the left side are relatively safe but the corners on the right side are still important areas. I think A an B are "miai". (If white play A black takes B and if white playes at B black plays at A.)

I would play at A in this position because after a black move at B a white stone at C would be a good continuation. (It corresponds nicely to the upper right corner and the black stone is weakened.)]
;W[qj];B[oc];W[jq];B[gp]
(;W[pc]LB[oe:B][qo:A]C[** This move is too defensive. You shouldn't play it while black has room along the border.

If you would play at A instead you would get a very stong position.

If you want you can play at B which is better than your move, but if black invades at A later white will end up with only two half corners ... and I wouldn't like such a game.]
;B[md];W[od];B[nd];W[nc]C[** Good. Black should have played here.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[oe];W[pd];B[mc];W[oa]LB[mb:A]C[** If you play at A instead then black's position will be a bit weaker.]

how to stop Q13 attack? i' think
R 13 is good but.....

** R13 can "stop the attack" but it's not necessary to "stop" it. Neither side can make much points in that area so you have to play somewhere else.

Your group in the corner is safe but the stone near the right border is a rather weak. As white I would play at A because this strengthens your stones and weakens the black stones at the same time.]
;W[qg];B[qh]
(;W[rg]LB[qf:A][ph:B]C[** There's no reason to play on the second line. When you play at A your stones are safe and black has to worry about his weakness at B]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[qe];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[pj]
(;W[rk]C[** There is no reason to play on the second line.

Note that your attempts to make territory near the border gave black a lot of influence in the center area. And since you're playing on the second line your territory is very small.]

C[** It's not necessary to defend a single stone. The stone is only worth one point while a wasted move is worth (perhpas) 15 points.]
;B[pm]LB[nm:B][qo:A]C[how to kill Q7 group before he make a room?

** Don't allow him to make a base near the boarder by playing at A. Then make sure he can't run to the center by playing at B. Don't start with attachments because the opponent will get stronger that way. If you make moves that make you stronger while he defends you don't even have to actually kill the black group to make profit.]

** It should be too late now. It would most probably die.

- how can i get beter?

** You just have to play more games. Try to sacrifice stones sometimes, and try to understand why you played each stone. After a few dozen slow games you could start learning with go problems. Don't think longer than a minute on a problem ... you will need a better intuition and not "superhuman" calculating skills to get stronger.

- if i 4-4 how to defend 3-3's attack?

** Visit <http://senseis.xmp.net/?33Invasion> You can't kill the 3-3 group but you can get other advantages.

thank for review my game
