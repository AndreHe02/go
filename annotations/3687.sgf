C[I was white. I won this game by resign as I was really far ahead, but what puzzles me is why I did so well. In most of my games I usually do bad in the opening and I come back in life death situations, dragon chasing, middle fights, and endgame. But in this game I seemed to just be taking complete control of almost every situation. Was it that I was making excellent moves or was my opponent was just not responding correctly or making too weak of moves? What major things did I do right and what major things did my opponent do incorrectly? Thank you.

Helllo,
My name is Avi Ben-Nun and I am a 3K player on IGS. Thank you for the opportunity to review your game. You played well and won - but of course you can still improve.

As you see from my rank, I am not a too strong player, so some of my comments may be wrong - do not take all of them for granted.  My comments will start with "A:".

In general, I do not write many comments on a game I review, because I believe a person can really learn just a few things from each game - so there is no point in adding comments that will distract the player from the main points. I added a small summary in my final comment to highlight the main points you should learn.

I would like very much to get your feedback for this review, so please email me back your comments.

Thanks, and Regards, Avi.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[co];B[cf];W[dq]
;B[jd];W[jq]C[A: I feel this move is incorrect because of 2 reasons: 
1. It is rather low (on the third line) in an area which is supposed to provide you with most of the points
2. It is in the wrong direction. It is better to extend to the right (like around R7) or approach at R14. R7 for example will threat to extend upper on the right side, increasing your area and reducing Black's.  If Black invades at the bottom he will probably live, but you will be able to press him from the two sides and get more points.

Since you also mention later that this is a point which is repeated in your games, I think you should consider my comment seriously here.]
;B[pj];W[ck];B[qn]C[By now I was afraid of how this would turn out because recently, letting my opponents get large, though weak moyo's has been my down fall when I fail to invade them but my opponent invades mine. So, I usually try to keep things broken up.

A: See my comment on your move K3.];W[ql];B[qq]C[A: Pincer here is the right move.]

(;W[qp]C[A: In my view this is the worng direction to block - White should have blocked at Q3. The rule is simple: Block such that your moyo is maximum. See the variant.

Once you play on one of the corner start-points, this situation is going to occur many times in your game - you this is another point you should take from this game to the future.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[rq];W[rp];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[pn];B[nq]C[that exchange didn't turn out as well as i'd hoped but I saw an opportunity to make some use of it by playing at r14 and use my group as influence.

A: Letting Black ltake large area like that in the corner is certainly not good; Moreover, Black has access to the center so it will be difficult for White to build a moyo there.]
;W[qf]C[I think my opponent would have been better to play a pincer at r12 instead of defending his corner.

A: May be you are right, although it leaves two weak Black stones (R12 and Q10) and starts a big fight. Right now Black is leading so his move is OK.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj];B[qi]C[A: I doubt if Black's line of play here is good. He may live small and reduce White's area, but White would get in return  big influence towards the center which is much bigger.]
;W[pi]
(;B[ph]C[A: Black continues the wrong direction. See the variant.]
;W[oi];B[qg];W[ri];B[qh];W[oh];B[rj];W[qk]C[At this point, I was rather happy with how the whole right side had turned out, but what I got after this was much better. Was it because I played the right moves to make use of what I had, or was it just that my opponent did some stupid things?

A: With S14 Black may save his 4 stones, but in any case White has achieved good position towards the center.]

(;B[rh];W[rk];B[si];W[rf]C[I thought I was going to kill his group because i already realized that I could escape my r14 group into the middle and I should be able to prevent him from getting two eyes.]
;B[og];W[pg];B[of];W[pe];B[qd];W[oe];B[ne];W[od];B[oc];W[pc]
;B[pb];W[nc];B[qc];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[rg]C[at this point I was a little disappointed that I wouldn't be able to kill it, but I almost think he would have been better off to let me kill s12 instead of letting me kill o13 and o15 as happenes.

A: I agree, the result is much better for White now. Black had several chances during this sequence to give up the S12 group and block White, taking control of the center - which is much better for Black - but he was locked on saving his group.]

;W[jp];B[ko];W[kn];B[kq];W[jr];B[ll];W[lm];B[jl]C[A: I do not like this move. What is Black trying to do? Save M8 stone? This is too small. Capture K2 group? This is not realistic.]
;W[il]C[here I expected j7 and then I would run my j8 stone out into the middle hoping to capture one of k8 or h7, but he let me connect, should he have cut?

A: Now that Black played K8, cutting is the only option. Letting White connect is awful: It leaves K8 and M8 deep behind and weakens H5 group.]
;B[jk];W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[ep];W[eq];B[ik];W[hl];B[gm];W[en]
C[A: This is an important turning point. White has connected his K2 wall with his stones on the right side. Black has weak stones on both sides of this wall. Now I think E6 is the wrong way to press Black - E8 is better. To arrive to that conclusion we should first agree that killing Black is difficult - so it is better to contain him and force him to live small while taking territory around. 

This is another important point you should take from this game - do not insist on killing your opponent's group - even if you can. Sometimes it is much better to let his live small!]
;B[em];W[fn];B[fm]C[A: White would not be able to kill Black with F9 (see variant on next move)]

(;W[fp];B[cm];W[dn];B[dm]C[A: Look at the outcome: Instead of Black fight for life, it is the White C9 stone which is in trouble...]
;W[ch];B[dg];W[ek];B[fk];W[fj];B[ej];W[dj];B[ei];W[gk];B[fl]
;W[gj];B[bg];W[bl];B[bm];W[di];B[dh];W[ig]C[I think he just didn't see that j13 made the ladder work. I realized taht if he guarded against the ladder that I might not be able to make my d10 group live, but I figured it would be a profitable exchange since j13 would also probably allow me capture k9 and get a very large moyo in the center.

A: If Black play correctly White group D10 will die, true. However, White's moyo in the center is not so big and Black can reduce it in several ways. For example: consider the moves M15, M13 and H12. On the other hand, by pressing White's center Black will gain large territories at the  top and top left. Playing this way, overall Black will take the lead.]

(;B[bh];W[eh]C[A: Now the game is over and White has a decisive advantage.

Summary: Look at moves 8, 14 and 88. These are the points you have to improve on - if you do, you will certainly get stronger by 3 stones at least.]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[gi];W[hi]C[kmashu has resigned the game.  I can see why he resigned, since I had a very large moyo in the center, many captures, and a lot of his moyo's could still be invaded in various places.]
