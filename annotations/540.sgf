AB[pd][dp];W[ce];B[pp];W[dc];B[gc]C[g is too close to white position k16 is better]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[A! I decided to pincer rather than defend on the right to try
to protect my stone at G17.

k17 is probably better];W[md]C[M! I wish I hadn't done this. I wish I had:
1. played a one point jump
2. gone into the corner at Q18, or
3. played a second kakari at R17
As it was, I strengthened Alan's stone at M17 making G17 an almost perfect extension from it.
Q18 remained open for ages afterwards - a 1kyu sitting next to us observed afterwards that I should have taken it fairly early on.
o16 is good solid move for handi game];B[ld];W[me];B[qf];W[cn]
C[white can keep the pressure on black by playing j17 or j16]
;B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[dj];B[pi];W[nq];B[pq]C[q3 is too slow for black
gives the initiative to white];W[kq];B[iq]C[A! I responded at J3 rather than secure at P/Q7/8 to reduce W's
base on the bottom.
A? Was this the right move?

j3 is good if white plays r6 seal white
another option is o5];W[pn];B[oo];W[om];B[ql]C[better for black to keep white separated with n5]
;W[mn]C[M! I should have replied with R6 but at this point I mistakenly thought that R8 and Q4 were still disconnected. They would have been had it not been for P5.]
;B[pm]
(;W[on];B[qn];W[pr]
(;B[qr]C[A! I chose R2 rather than P2
A? Which is the right move?

r2 keeps sente];W[or];B[no]
(;W[nn]C[o6 is bad shape];B[po];W[fb]C[A! At this point I feel comfortable about my groups. I am concerned
about the size of the W moyo developing on the left.
A? How do I go about addressing this?

there is a running battle between the white stones at n15 and the black stones at m17 and g17
black should play l14 to attack white and making its own group safe]

(;B[gb];W[ge]C[M! I wish I had played this one point to the left. As it was Alan snipped it off and  made a bigger dent than necessary in the area I was aiming for.]
;B[fc];W[eb]C[better for white to play j16 to keep or m15
then for black was better to jump to l14 or connect with  j16]
;B[fe]
(;W[ee];B[ff]
(;W[ef];B[he];W[gf];B[fg];W[ni]C[A! I was surprised by this move as the W group at G14/15 could
prove difficult to deal with if extended to H14.
M! I was conscious that the three stones at n15/16 and o17 were vulnerable. A hangover from not having played the right move back at move 7 or thereabouts. I was reluctant just to go into Q18 as I was unsure that I could live if disconnected from the outside.

o11 is an overplay that makes three weak white groups
and one is bound to die or else black will make a lot of profit. Better to play m15 to attack black]

(;B[gd];W[le];B[hf];W[pl];B[qm];W[pk]C[M! pressing while trying to get closer to my three (now four) stones in the top right. Still a liability.]
;B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[qi]C[it would be simpler to play
 k15];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri];W[oi];B[qi];W[eh]C[f6 is another option]

(;B[gg]C[c8 maybe bigger];W[en];B[pb];W[mb];B[jd]C[better for black to invade white moyo with h10 or so]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[ke];B[kd]C[l15 is not necessary
better again to invade white moyo
then for white is better to play g11 instead of l15];W[of];B[pg]
;W[og];B[pf];W[gp]C[M! Running out of ideas here. All my eggs in one basket - the moyo on the left - I'm just hoping to press it outwards and relying on Alan to fall back...

g4 is an overplay should be g5];B[gq];W[hp];B[ip]C[A! Trying to secure an escape path.
A? Does it work with what follows?
M! I don't think you need an escape path. A way in to spoil, maybe.]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[er];W[gr];B[fr];W[ir];B[gs]
;W[jr]C[M! I was happy with this because I was sure I had these two white stones. I was wrong, as it turned out. Walking through the next twenty-odd moves I just see Black bubbling out and me playing stones that soon after turn out to be in the wrong place...there's some principle to trapping groups in big space that I haven't grasped. Perhaps it's not doable?!?!

the black stones should die or help white close the moyo];B[kp]

drastically reduced my territory.];B[rs]
(;W[ps];B[rq]C[A! After playing this I said that I thought Matthew had missed
a good  play at R3 instead of Q1.
A? Was I right?

M! I think it's a ko fight for about 10 points. I felt very threadbare in the corridor running up the right-middle and didn't want to even think about it. I was happy just to keep sente. A bit cowardly I guess.]
;W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[jb];W[ga]C[M! oops, not the biggest move
