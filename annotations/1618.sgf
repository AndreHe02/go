C[Hello
I am 5k* on IGS and I have White in this game.
Black is at least 2 stones stronger then me.
Please provide any comments that you wish and when appropriate, add variations.
Thanks...

SD : hi, i made comments untill  move 96.
In this game, your opponent took the lead because you let a weak group at the beggining, that gave him a chance to launch a severe attack. 
I'm sure you'll make signifiant progress if you try in the future to focus on 2 topics : 
- not creating another group or attacking if you have allready  a weak group in the neighbourhood.
- always play the urgent moves (reinforcement of a weak group, attack of a weak group) before the big moves (moves that makes big territory but threaten or reinforce nothing).

Hope this will help.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[op]C[I am trying  to prevent black from having a big moyo
SD : this seems possible.];B[lp];W[on];B[qn]
(;W[qq]C[SD : i think this attachement is a little bit early.]
;B[rq];W[pq];B[rr]C[SD : black S2 move limits the white area, and white still need to stabilize his group.
If you want to play fast in order to split the 2 black stones, i recommend you the variation beginning with white p8.]
;W[hq]SQ[lp][fq]C[This may not be good but I do not know how to handle this situation. My aim is to separate the  marked stone at M4 from F3
SD : it's a good idea to split, but you need first to reinforce your p4 group for 2 reasons : 
1) it's hard to deal with 2 weaks groups in one area. First reinforce, then create another one.
2) Giving strength to your P4 group will help you to split black.

Another thing : it seems dangerous to split with a move in the third line. Also, why not playing at the very middle of the position (line J)?]
;B[nq];W[kq]LB[ol:B][pl:D][ln:C][fp:A]TR[lp]C[SD : L3 doesn't seem very good to me : it gives black 2 forcing moves (M3 or L4).
I would prefer to catch F3 with A, or adding a move to stabilize the white group (B, C or D)]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[jo];W[ip];B[kn];W[fp]LB[ol:A][mp:C][lq:B]C[SD : now F4 is not an urgent move, because your J4 group is almost alive : better play at A , maybe playing first the exchange B-C.]
;B[cn]LB[ol:A]C[SD : black is approaching a strong group. It's urgent for both player to play at A !]
;W[co]C[SD: 
1) P8 is far bigger.
2) locally, i prefer C5 at C4.];B[dn];W[eq]LB[dk:C][dn:B][co:A]
SQ[cq]C[I wanted to stabilize the white groupe in the bottom left and to prevent C3
SD : yes but you helped black to build a position on the left board !.
So simply play C4 allows you not to play E3.
If you play A-B, you have to play a pincer at C, otherwise you should play C4 wihout playing the exchange A-B.]
;B[pl]LB[co:1][fp:2][eq:3]TR[on][op][pq][qq]C[Severe move; The marked group is in trouble
SD : yes, black lets you three times the opportunity to play P8. You would have a far better game :)]
;W[mo]C[SD : too slow. Imagine black playing a capping move...(see variation).]

(;B[lq];W[ol];B[pk];W[lo]C[forcing move to get some strength before running out]
;B[ko];W[mm];B[ci];W[cg];B[ei];W[nc]LB[kl:A]SQ[mk]C[should this have been at N9 instead? or somewhere else?
SD : maybe a move at A will put some pressure on black group, but black may not respond (because of black K3), so O17 seems ok.]
;B[ok];W[nl]LB[kl:A]C[SD : too slow. Escape the other side with A.]
;B[mj];W[kl]C[Unfortunately, this group has to run];B[jl]
(;W[km]C[I am not sure this move is necessary, it seemed to make B stronger
SD : yes this is helping black enclosing you :-)
You should simply play at K9 (see var.).];B[jm];W[in]C[This is probably bad. I was expecting it to be a forcing move,
Where should black play? L10?
SD : yes l10 better. But the first mistake is L7.];B[io];W[ho]
LB[kj:A]TR[in]C[SD : forgt this stone, the important is to run out with your group.]
;B[hn];W[jk]C[Probably, should not hane! Where should W play?
SD : L10.];B[kk];W[hm];B[gn];W[im];B[il];W[gm];B[go];W[hp];B[fm]
;W[gl]C[
White is getting in trouble here
SD : yes big trouble. You cannot fight in this position.];B[ik]

;W[nk];B[nj];W[lk];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[li];B[ji];W[nh];B[ph]
;W[qf]LB[ne:B][mf:A]C[SD : too dangerous. you still need to reinforce your white group. maybe A or B.]
;B[pf]TR[pd][ph]C[SD : Now black has a wall that will help him to enclose the center white group.
The position is very comfortable for black, you should'nt invade at R14.]
;W[rd];B[qg];W[qc];B[pc];W[qe];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[nf]C[SD : white is cut. better at N13.]
;B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[qi];W[pe];B[og]C[SD : P13 wasn't necessary. Black should try to kill white. See variation.]
