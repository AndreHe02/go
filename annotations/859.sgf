C[To the reviewer:

I'd like to thank you in advance for reviewing this game.  Recently, I seem to have hit a hurdle in my play: I seem to have a distressing tendency to fall far behind fairly early on, and don't realize this until too late.  As the game is progressing, I don't actually see myself falling behind; then, all of a sudden, I look at the board and it looks as though I'm trailing.  And when I look at the game afterwards, I can't see where I'm going wrong, or what I should be doing differently.   All I can see is the result at the end -- which is that I'm trailing badly.  Since things are getting out of hand so early, I'm guessing that there must be something quite fundamental that I'm doing wrong, but I can't tell what that something is!

I've been told by other reviewers that  I need to count the score and let that be my guide as to what to do, but I find that I have great difficulty assessing whether I'm actually ahead or behind, and by how much.  Sometimes when I win I'm quite surprised, as I thought I was trailing; I've also had games where it looked to me as though I was winning comfortably, only to find out when the score is counted that I've actually lost by 10 points!  In this game, I hope I didn't mis-count and resign too early.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger
Fedya on KGS];B[dd]C[hello
i also play on KGS as Danthekyu
i'm not good at counting so i will not lecture you on this!]
;W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[ep]C[so far so good];W[dn]C[ok]
(;B[dq]C[this is a mistake];W[cq]C[ok];B[iq]
(;W[cf]C[Fedya: This isn't premature, is it?  I thought the group in the bottom left was settled.

it is ok
you might also think about harassing a little the black group]
;B[di]C[possible for black but i think this is not the best for him]
;W[cc]C[ok]
(;B[dc]C[now, that is completely bad because there is no black stone at k16]
;W[cd];B[de];W[bf];B[ce]C[Fedya: I haven't seen this move before, and it isn't in the joseki dictionary I've got.  I think I should just play naturally here, but I didn't feel as though I got a very good position out of it.

it is another black mistake reinforcing white for no reason]
;W[be]C[ok];B[cb];W[bb];B[db]
(;W[dg]C[Fedya: Is this move a mistake?  I thought it was a good idea to try to split the D11 stone and the group above, but after Black's next move, I wonder if I should have employed a different strategy.

in fact, what you need is to take advantage of black mistake in playing an inappropriate joseki

big mistake n°1];B[cl]C[Fedya: Now my group in the bottom left looks weak.  Black can attack with B6, taking away eye-space for White.

your white group is not that weak specially since the 2 black stones are weak themselves]

(;W[bn]C[Fedya: I don't like this move, but I think I need to settle this group.  The problem is that this gives Black sente

group is already settled (at 90%), therefore bad move big mistake n°2]
;B[bi]C[allows black to settle himself];W[lc]C[Fedya: So far, so good, I think.  Right now the game doesn't look like it's gotten at all out of hand.  Here I wanted to stop Black from getting a large moyo on the top.

the idea is right but better at a k16 prevents black extension
big mistake n°3];B[ic]C[too nice with black! (who should not be allowed to be so happy so easily!)]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[od]C[Fedya: This was more or less what I expected.  I'd get some territory on top and reduce Black's potential for getting a moyo.]
;B[qf]
(;W[qj]C[Fedya: I think this was the mistake.  I wanted to limit what Black could get in the top right corner, but after Black's next move, I end up with two weak groups.  Things quickly spiralled out of control from there.  As for the best move here, I'd have to guess something like R8 or M3.  I've included a few variations to show why I don't like either of those moves, though.

I think playing like that is not a mistake];B[qn]
(;W[qm]C[Fedya: There's a proverb about defending from the weak side.  But in this case, which side is the weaker side?  Both ended up being weak.

that is a mistake
you should try to avoid contact plays in general which in general reinforce the other

it is probably THE losing move big mistake n°4];B[pm];W[ql]
;B[nq]
(;W[oq]C[Fedya: It wouldn't be better to play at R5, would it?  My thought originally was that Black could play at S6, but I don't think this works for Black because White can cut at Q6.  Is *this*, and not my earlier move at R10, the losing move?

I think r7 is the biggest mistake
here the immediate cut would be better, but your proposal loks good too (better than the game)
big mistake n°5];B[np];W[rp]C[Fedya: I *really* didn't like this last move.  It gives up sente, and allows Black to continue to attack me.  But I can't give up the corner.  I'm amazed at how quickly I went from being in a relatively even game to being terribly far behind.  I think I should have played at R5 instead.

NEVER try to live in the corner by allowing the other to cut you from the center when you can avoid it]

(;W[fg]C[Fedya: I didn't know what to do here.  I felt I had sente, and had to do something with it to reduce Black.  My point here was to try to reduce Black at the top, but I'm not certain as to how best to go about that.  But Black's next move just seems to make his territory stronger.  Would the cap at J15 have been better?

yes for j15];B[ge];W[qg]C[Fedya: I wanted to play something that would get me more territory, since I already thought I was behind due to the large amount of territory Black has at the bottom.

white group still unsure
your move reinforces black (contact plays always do so!)];B[pf]
C[yes];W[pg]C[worse];B[of];W[jc]TR[lc][oc][od]C[Fedya: After Black's last move, I was quite worried about Black leaving my three stones at the top isolated.  This move was designed to help them get some more eye-space, as well as prevent Black from playing a reducing move like L16.

the move (contact play) is acceptable since it reinforces only a black group that is already strong
i approve it];B[id];W[jd];B[je]
(;W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg]
(;W[ib]C[Fedya: I thought quite some time about this move.  I was also thinking of playing at F6.  I decided to play here first as I thought it was sente.  It turns out not to be, however.]
;B[hb];W[jb]C[in fact all the previous moves are more yose plays than middle game]
;B[fn]TR[fn]C[Fedya: I had thought on a couple of occasions about playing this move (back at White 58, 60, and 72), but I couldn't tell whether it reduces Black enough to make it worthwhile.  How big would it be for White to have played here instead of Black?

very big (i do not count, i told you ;-) )]
(;W[hc]C[Fedya: I misread this sequence.  I thought I'd be able to capture either the H18 stone or the group at J17.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[gb]C[Fedya: Now I can't play at F18 because the G16 stone serves as a ladderbreaker for Black.  This is why J18 isn't sente.]
;W[em]C[Fedya: Looking for something more to do to reduce Black.  This also puts pressure on the Black group on the left side.
ok];B[ek]
(;W[gh]C[see variation];B[gk]C[good];W[fl]C[Fedya: I took a long time on this move as well.  I think I've had sente on each of my last several moves, yet I don't have any idea what to do with it.  This has been a repeated problem in my games.

not so much NOW than previous moves

(;W[fo];B[eo]
(;W[fp];B[gp];W[fq];B[eq]
(;W[gq];B[hq]C[Fedya: This was a move I didn't see coming.  I thought that Black would have to do something to save the two stones at H4 and H5.]
;W[hr]C[Fedya: I looked at the position for quite some time to see if there was any way to save my group.  But Black has too many liberties for me to win any semeai.  Never mind that Black could also cut at G7.]
;B[ir];W[er];B[dr]C[Fedya: Here I realised that I was going to lose the capturing race, and that I would be so far behind that there was no hope of catching up.  By my reckoning, what Black gets in the left center will be about equal to what White gets in the bottom left; Black's two groups at the top are larger than White's two top groups put together, and the Black area at the bottom is much bigger than what White has on the right side.  Black is probably ahead by about 50 points, right?  Or did I resign too early?

i am not good at counting but you were right to resign, you are a lot behind.
the main point is you gave black the control of the center without even realising what you were doing.
that was in the "small fight" that occured on the right.

never hesitate to exchange something the other wants badly against something else (bigger!) you can take in exchange]

This is the only result I can see from playing at R8 or M3, and I don't think it's good for White.  (Indeed, I've had a number of games where my opponent invades the corner when I've got a formation like the three marked stones.  This would imply that I shouldn't be playing so lightly.  But if I don't play lightly, I'll only get a small corner, while my opponent gets a large moyo on both sides.)

in fact this situation is not bad for white who is bound to get thickness on the outside]

who is weak?

in fact black cannot attack white NOW as far as his group is not settled
this does not mean he will not attack later
