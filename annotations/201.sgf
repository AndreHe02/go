C[RazorBrain is Black.   I feel like I did several things wrong in this game.

First, I fail to finish off a white group caught in a ladder early on. This comes back to bite me with amaizing ferocity.

Second, I got complacent and let white have way too much territory on the left. I'm just not sure when and where I should have done something different to get a better esult.

What I would like from this review is your comments on what I did right and wrong.

I'm currently trying to play more games, as I find that I prefer study to playing. I guess I hate feeling completely ignorant game after game. I do however realize that I need to play more.

I'm also studing openings, attack and defense and I'm trying to work a few problems every day. Any suggestions?

Thanks!

;B[pc];W[dq];B[qe];W[oq]LB[kc:a]C[In the opening, you should try to play "big" moves. Big moves offer the possibility to gain territory or to restrict enemy territory.   BIG =  a) Approach moves
b) Enclosures
c) Extensions along the side

The approach here is certainly a big move,  but there was an even bigger one: a play at the top to prevent Black from extending from his enclosure.   VERY BIG=
a) Extension from an enclosure
b) A play to prevent an enemy extension from an enclosure];B[mq]
C[Better than playing at q6, which would leave Black with all his stones on the same side of the board.

I would seriously consider playing at the huge point k16, extending in front of the enclosure although that would probably result in White playing the Taisha at q6 (a joseki I thoroughly enjoy, but also full of danger).]
;W[qq]C[I haven't studied much joseki yet. I must admit I just go by feel in situations like this.

--

This is not a bad move, since it should lead to White settling in the corner. But better would be the one-point jump to get outside.

Why is that? Well, if a group gets sealed into a corner or into the side, then it is more likely to die. If it lives, it gains little territory (perhaps two points--one for each eye), whilst giving the opponent "thickness" (strong powerful formation) which influences the fighting across the board in his favour.

If, however, you preserve a link to the outside, your group can affect fighting over a wide area and thereby be useful.

So, make life if you have to. But if you can get out into the open without risking death, do so.]
;B[pp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[sp]
(;B[pj]C[Black veiws his wall as thickness, and extends from it, which is a pretty good idea.

BUT!
Black has NOT finished his wall off, and leaves it with glaring tactical weaknesses.]
;W[qo]C[This is painful to Black.]
(;B[qn];W[po]C[The ladder does NOT work (as I indicate a little later). It is broken by c16.]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[pm]C[Black is destoying his own position by playing out the ladder. It is reckoned by master players that every play in a ladder which doesn't work costs you at least seven points. Black, by this calculation, has already given up a whopping 28 points by making four plays in a bad ladder.]

(;W[co]C[Since playing this game I have read that leaving ladders unattended is not wise. I learn later  this in this game. :-)

--

OUCH! White would have won the game here and now by playing out the ladder.

If you want to get strong, follow the advice given by Kageyama in his wonderful, fantastic and altogether brilliant book "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go." Practice reading out ladders in your head, again and again, until you can read them confidently. Set up a short ladder, then read it out in you mind on stone at a time, visualising each stone in the sequence. DON'T try to make shortcuts with diagonal lines and by tracing patterns with your finger. This won't tell you what effect an apparent "ladder breaker" will really have--sometimes a stones in the way of the ladder only diverts it and does not really break it. Only reading it properly will tell you. As you exercise, REPEATEDLY, make the ladders longer and longer until you can read one right or down the board like this one. It is not as hard as it seems, since a ladder has NO VARIATIONS. It either works in its basic form, or it doesn't. Practice reading long ladders, and you will find that you can handle ladders with much more confidence and avoid losing golden opportunities such as this one. Practice reading ladders, and your visualisation skills will improve greatly, and this will help you to read better in all situations on the go board (and not just ladders).

--];B[ec]C[This moves is a kind of "reverse ladder break". If White tried to pull out of the ladder now, the ladder would reach this stones first and enable Black to capture.

See variation.]
(;W[dc]C[This does NOT break the ladder. The ladder would still work.

In another way, this move is not too good. Sure it defends the corner, but in general, making contact with a weak stone is not the way to attack it, since it only encourages Black to add a stone to strengthen it.]
;B[ed];W[db];B[eb]C[Poor. Black should leap out to h17 or h16 to control a wider area. White can now happily invade at around L16.]
;W[cj]C[Not bad, since this is a big point. But it now gives Black time to play an even bigger point at the top.]
;B[jd]C[I'm feeling pretty good at this point. I have the beginnings of a powerful framework and I'm still eyeing the bottom.

--
Black takes this huge point, setting up a framework stretching from d18 to s5.   White's framework is much smaller. With his thickness at the lower right and the top, Black has influence enough to go right into White's territory and shred it to ribbons.]
;W[jq]C[Or I was!];B[kp]C[Now would have been a good time to take the three white stones.]
;W[gq];B[cf];W[df]
(;B[ef]C[Black enables White to make territory on the fourth line, but gets a strong position in conjunction with the top and right side. This is a good plan here, but one should be wary about allowing the opponent fourth line territory--it's much easier to hold on to than the centre territory you get in return.

d15 is worth considering as an alternative. See variations.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[eh]C[At this point I am content to play along with this creeping wall. I still feel okay about this even though he is making territory on the four line. It's a little later on that I feel he gets too much.]

(;W[kc]C[White is obviously feeling the pressure I wanted him to feel.

--
This is an execrable move. White is jealous of Black's framework and dives right in deep, just begging to be attacked. As a rule of thumb, the bigger and stronger the framework, the more shallowly one should enter it. It's just not reasonable of White to expect a good result playing right into the middle of Black's strong position like this.

MUCH better is g12, breaking the ladder and threatening to descend further into Black's territory.

LEARN to play lightly in strong enemy positions. You will be surprised at how much damage you can do using "gentle" erasing moves.]

Yes, you killed White very nicely there :-)
But I have to say, I think White only got his just desserts there. He was all envious and dived in deep into your strong area, and got duly swatted.]
;W[kb];B[ma];W[ei]C[Okay, now he startes to come out on me and threatens to begin making greater chunks of territory. I play along for a while because I get greedy and can not pass up building a strong wall facing the center all down the left side.   What could I / should I have done different to avoid weaknesses that he later exploits to take territory in the middle???]
;B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[gj]
(;B[gi]C[This is a mistake, because it pushes White out into the centre, whilst weakening Black's group at g8. Much better was h10 keeping White pressed tight to the wall. It gets trickk, but it all seems to end up in Black's favour.]

C[Here I give up on the ko fight as I feel I don't have enough good threats. As he onl beat me beat me by only a few points, I now wish I had tried harder. But, I was feeling fat and happy and thought I could let it slide. Laziness never pays.

--
You must read and read and read. You must count territories carefully too. Only patience and working hard on your positional judgement will gain the victory.]

C[Is there something I could have done to hurt white's lower left corner?

--  If the were not so many White stones around the corner or there were already some Black stones there, you might have been able to cause trouble by playing at d2, but here White is pretty much secure over the whole left-hand side.]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[nq];B[nn];W[hk];B[ip];W[jl]C[I was planning on cathching white's middle group to finish off my great victory. Ha! Now he starts to make a living shape . .]

;B[jf];W[jj];B[jg]C[No need. You'd be able to take back straight away if you really wanted to, but these two stones are worthless anyway. Urgent now is to play k4 to get connected.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[ll];B[il];W[ik]C[I'm not good at killing groups like this. Was there a way I missed?

--
I don't know, but you should play k4 to secure your own central group. White could cause you real trouble by poking through at k4. Always make sure your own position is secure before you look to kill; conversely, when defending, look for weak points in the enemy shape that you can exploit in order to assist your escape.]

Get a book on tesuji, preferably James Davies's book, and study it until it hurts. But don't try to play tesuji for their own sake--learn them so well that they become obvious to you, and then use them WHERE APPROPRIATE to get the desired results. Remember, tesuji are not just about killing, but also for purposes such as securing life, making shape, escaping, reducing enemy territory, building thickness, starting ko and so on.

Read carefully.

Try to estimate the size of territories, remembering to include komi and prisoners, and plan your strategy accordingly.

The stronger and bigger the enemy framework, the less deeply you should go into. Remember that you can cause surprising amounts of damage by using "keshi" ("gentle" erasing moves like the shoulder hit). White's invasion at L17 was totally unreasonable and was punished in fine style.

I hope this all helps.
Best wishes,
Tristan Jones

(;B[so];W[rq];B[qn]C[Black has finished his wall and has a strong outside position. White will have to defend his corner at some stage. In the corner, even quite larger areas can be killed or turned into ko.   To be sure, White could probably get away with leaving the corner alone right now, but as it stands it has potential to go very bad very quickly ("bad aji"). I would give serious consideration to settling it right now.

See continuation.];W[mr]C[This hit underneath on the second line is a good general technique for settling weak stones: learn it.

In other words, the hit underneath is a "tesuji".

I would like to say something about tesuji now.

Tesuji are special moves, but they are NOT inspirational bolts from the blue. Rather, they are skilful techniques which enable a player to achieve specific results. The emphasis here is on TECHNIQUE. You should study and memorise as many tesuji of all kinds as possible, so that you can spot them and use them--or prevent the opponent using them--as a matter of routine.   Tesuji include not only spectacular placements and sacrifices for killing, but include all kinds of special-purpose moves such as the "hit underneath" illustrated here. There are tesuji for setlling stones, for creating possibilities ("potential" or "aji"), for improving one's shape or for spoiling the opponent's shape, for escaping tight positions, for generating ko fights, for making life or for settling weak stones. A good vocabulary of tesuji will help you play much more strongly in local situations, and therby enable you to gain control on a wider scale.

How to learn tesuji? Read "Tesuji" by James Davies. Try hard to get it if you don't have. Dig it out if you do have it and have got frustrated with it. Then study each tesuji again and again until you understand it. Try the exercises. If you struggle with them, set out the positions on the board and play out possibilities, then look at the answers and try to grasp the principles. Copy out examples into a notebook. Make flashcards. Try to construct your own examples of them. Look at them again and again. Then look at them again. Get your friends or spouse to test you. Repetition and determination enable you to learn--it certainly is helping me!

And when you have learned some tesuji? DON'T try and play them in all your games; use them only when APPROPRIATE. Make tesuji a means to an end, not the end itself!]
;B[nr]C[As you get stronger, you will find players will almost automatically draw back (in this case, to m2) in response to a hit underneath instead of cross-cutting as here. Cross-cutting looks good, but enables White to force his way out into the middle.]
;W[nq];B[lr]C[Better would be to admit the mistake and play at o4 to keep White as tight as possible to the edge. But you need to know how to deal with this kind of crude play at m2.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[np]C[Voila! White has got into the centre, and Black's wall from p4 to t6 is looking rather less impressive. Don't worry too much about getting your corner territory reduced at this stage--there was only about 10 points in it at most anyway, and getting into the centre is worth far more than that here.]
