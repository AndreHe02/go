C[This
game was played on the KGS server between me(10k) and constins (9k) and I
played black. Although in the record, I won by 2.5 points, I didn't consider
myself to have won since it was a last minute mistake by white that allowed
me to move into his territory. I think my main question is how did I go wrong
in the upper right corner? Any other comments or pointers would be welcome.

Thanks];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fc]C[Wrong placement.  If you are going to approach W here, better would be F16 which plays better with both B stones.  W should attach at F16 and build a wall that looks down at W D4.  B would get stronger too, but W would be bigger.
G16 would be even better.  But since BQ3 is low, any stone in this area is hard to make work well.

I like K16 here, or even better the very simple p17.  There is plenty of space and time to do something on the left side or top.]
;W[ed];B[fq]C[You cannot ignore E16.  This is a gift - make your steel post at F16 and now you are starting to build something that makes sense of F17.

Continuation - W should crawl to E15

B can push once more, or extend to K16 immediately -the move I prefer.  B is building on a larger scale.

An even simpler option for B was G16 - avoids making W stronger while making B stronger.  THere is no urgency at the bottom - and the low B stones on the right will not support an approach here.]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[cn];B[hn]C[I believe the "honte" or right move here is J4.  That is a joseki and works well here.  So does H5.  H6 is just "off" a bit.

To settle things, you can attach at D3 or slide to D2.];W[od]
C[W 12 is reasonable here - it exploits the weakness of the single B stone on the top which is now outnumbered 3-1.

You really need to pincer here to support that black stone.

Otherwise, attach at P15 to play better wtih Q3 and to make some sense of G6.    Locally, attaching at P17 works, but it wouldn't be the best whole-board move here.]
;B[pg]C[If you are going to play this direction, the two proper plays are R13 or Q14.

When white approaches with a one-point space, you should extend a one by a one-point jump.  If W approache one line further away, you can play more loosely too.    The exception is for the base-shape of the two-point jump on the 3rd line which is almost always solid enough.]
;W[qc]C[W has given you an underserved gift.  You can now make Q13 a good, proper, joseki move if you play the proper joseki here.]
;B[pd]C[OOPS.  This move is wrong on nearly every level.

One ought not willingly and unnecessarily butt one's head on an opponents stone.  This is almost as strong a rule as avoiding empty triangles.

The proper move here would be S17,  w-pulls back to Q17, b makes shape with S15, w extends to around M17 or N16.  (M17 is superior here)

Now you have a classic joseki which makes Q13 a good move.

There is not a particularly good continuation for B from this point on in this corner - W gets the corner and some on the side, B gets heavy.]
;W[po]C[Oops.  W should not have left the battle in this shape.  You must now punish this immediately by the simplest move - Q17.  A huge, huge gift.

Notice how not only R17 seems useless after Q17, but P16 is terribly lonely - and F17 is starting to come into play again.]
;B[mp]C[Same over-extentsion as in the upper right, only worse because of the weakness underneath B17.  Therefore B17 must be at N3, if in this direction at all.

The pincer at Q7 plays well with the stones at the top here.]
;W[kq]C[W immediately sets up to exploit the weakness under the B stone at N4, while building a stable base.]
;B[qm]C[Very inconsistent play.  First one direction, then another.  Also, this should be at Q7 to make sense of all the stones on the board.]
;W[pp]C[An interesting move - but it butts its head again -as you did.  W is outnumbered in this area 3-2.  So W should not play to get heavy.  There are many, many, many better moves here.]
;B[nq]C[Ok.  But actually, better is R3.  It plays better with R7 and supports the stone at N4 while making things harder on W.  W still has some chance for an eye on the side or in the corner now.]
;W[ci];B[nn]C[Right idea, but either P7 or O7 is better.    Actually, I would play to make W run and then make points chasing W.  So R3 still works.  And if W lets them go, you can come back and grab them anytime later.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[qn];B[om];W[ql];B[rm];W[pn];B[qk];W[rn];B[rl]
;W[qq]C[Ok.  You built good outside strength - but note how W has good chances here due to the weakness of Q3.

And note how your massive wall seems just a bit overconcentrated with the two b stones in the uppr right.  If you had this wall, you would much prefer Q 13 to be at P15.]
;B[jd]C[Take your points at Q17.  Then look to doing whatever is needed at the top.]
;W[pc];B[nc]C[OUCH.  Don't peep at a cutting point.];W[pe]C[getting ugly for both now.]
;B[qe];W[qf]C[Ya gotta read this all out.  As I read it, though I might be  missing something, the better cut is at p15.  B ends up with the corner two stones captured and w has a heavy group floating in the middle.  Cutting at Q14 gives b a compressed territory on the right and the top b formation is still loose and facing what will be strong w shapes on both sides.

And if W plays it right,  b ends up very small on the right and w gets some stones and shape in the center.]
;B[pf];W[re]C[yep.  there it is.

you now need to decide what to give up.  the connection to the center or the side or a largish corner.]
;B[rd];W[oe];B[rf];W[qg];B[qh]C[Giving up the corner, I see.  If you were going to do that, you should have captured Q15 early and just given up the space rather than space plus about 6 stones.

If you want to save the corner group, the only move is B S13.]
;W[rg];B[se];W[rh];B[qi];W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[pj];W[ri];B[oi]
C[This was well played by W - a bit high-level sacrificing and reading - unless W more or less stumbled into it.

B must now immediately cut at P17 to salvage anything here.]
;W[sc]C[Cut now.  This allows B to squeeze the 3 w stones in sente thereby strengthening B's center power and the top stones.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[oc];W[sb]C[You can still squeeze.  The issue is to squeeze now or save it.

This is the time of game to estimate your points and assess options.

You can take points at hte top now if you want.  You can cap on the left at F11.  You can attack the two w stones on the bottom in a number of ways. You can attack the W group on the lower right - to solidify yourself further.]
;B[jo]C[not a bad choice of area to play in.  not the best move.

The shoulder hit at K4 is better.  So is L5.

There are other more complicated choices too.];W[mr]C[Remember that comment earlier about the weakness under your move at N4?  Here it is.]

;B[kn];W[lo];B[ln];W[mo];B[no];W[mn];B[mm];W[jn];B[jm];W[jp]
;B[io];W[lp];B[ob];W[sd]C[You've now lost the squeeze play on the three w stones - the squeeze is bigger than the empty triangle descent.]
;B[jh]C[Seriously wrong placement.  Right idea to use the wall somehow, but this is altogether wrong.

Note how lame it becomes if W jumps to n15 - because you didn't squeeze at O15.

Note how W can snarf stones at H17 or H 16.

Note how W can build territory with two simple moves - G15 followed by F11.

So this needs to take all of these things into account.

It should be either at G15 - to make sense of P18 and F17 and K16, or it should be at E or F11 to make sense of the moves on the right and lower sides.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[fd];B[gc];W[ic];B[id];W[jc];B[nf]C[Poor timing and placement.

Connect at G16 first.  this leaves the 3 w stones at the top still vulnerable and gives you chances to make even more strength toward the center.

Also, this does not take a liberty and so does not even yet threaten the squeeze.]
;W[gd];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[ld];W[ec]C[Very painful for B.

Notice how you would now play the B stone at K12 at the very least somewhere around G11 or even H12 - certainly not where it is.  So W has exploited the weakness of that move effectively.]
;B[cq]C[OK.  but you would rather leave here with sente.];W[dq]
;B[dr];W[cp];B[cr];W[ei]C[And this is why.];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm]
;W[cm];B[dj];W[di];B[be]C[Desperate.  Are you that far behind?  I don't think so.  I think something simpler around E13 may be sufficient.]
;W[bc]C[Well, W gives it to you anyway.];B[ef];W[cf];B[gf];W[he]

C[W is pretty good at sacrificing and reading.  But gets caught at times.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[pr]C[This was the right move here.];W[qr];B[eo]
;W[dn];B[fl];W[gp];B[go];W[de];B[pb];W[re];B[gq]C[no.  connect at E3.  B4 is large too.  D4 is attractive, but not just yet.]

;W[aj];B[ak];W[cj];B[bm]C[good seki - but w error in letting it happen]
;W[qb];B[pa];W[qa]C[The problems in the upper right all started with the mistake of butting your stones right into W instead of playing joseki for shape.

Or it maybe even started earlier with the large knights move leaving weaknesses that kept being exploited by W.

In the fight itself, you simply had not read out far enough to see what was going to happen.  Then the failure to set up the squeeze cost more and more points.]
