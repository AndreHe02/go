AB[pd][dp][pp]C[G : hi, I noted my comments with this nice "G". I hope it will be useful for you.]
;W[dd];B[jp]C[G: good point, you could also approach the white corner.]
;W[qn]
(;B[no]C[G : this move is weird, but I'm not telling you it is wrong.
O4 woulf be the standard answer. But if you want to apply more pressure on white, maybe P6 is good. Another standard possibility would be the variation shown. But then again, playing a "standard way" is not very funny. You should just take note that this variation is a good idea, then play it if you like it.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[G : I believe this is the wrong direction. You should play the variation.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo]
C[G : now if you look, at black's position, it is obvious that the  O5 stone is not needed. Black is overconcentrated in the area.]
;W[pj]LB[qg:A][qh:B]C[zwom: better to extend/pincer both stones here?  At a or b perhaps?

G: they both look ok. Black is strong in the area, so B looks a little better as it is more severe.]
;B[ql]C[this seems like I'm rekilling a stone now.

G : yes. And Black is really overconcentrated. You should use your thickness by attacking the Q10 stone, with A or B you mentioned just before.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[qf]C[and now look at him.

G : yes, and look at you! So many stones in one single area, they're not useful at all. But now you're really strong here, so maybe you could try to attack by playing R12 or something annoying for white.]
;B[nd];W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[fo]C[G : F5 better, more calm. This move can possibly reinforce white and damage your lone stone.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[dk]
(;B[dm]C[G : this move is aji-keshi. You lose the potential cut here. Better to play at C10]
;W[dn]
(;B[el]C[G : ouch, bad move, see variation]
(;W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[ci];W[dl]C[G : well, here it comes];B[em]
;W[cm];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[ei]
(;B[gl]C[would this be pushing from behind, would the variation be better?  Or can this be justified giving white has to worry of the cut?

G : I added a few moves to your variation.. it leads to a bad squeeze.
It's bad to push from behind like this, but you are somewhat forced to do it because of your moves at D7 and E8]
;W[fn];B[il];W[hm]C[G : being forced to flee in the center, you reinforce white. He can now aim at invading the bottom. The cause of this is the combination of D7 and E8 moves. The issue of the fight is of course unclear, but i feel that white has the upper hand thanks to these moves.]
;B[hl];W[go];B[gq];W[fp];B[fq];W[ep];B[eq]C[G : good defense. If you tried to save this F5 stone, you'd have lost big. But now white is settled, and he can try to attack.]
;W[ho];B[jn]C[G : good move. White's move was sooo slow, you take the opportunity to connect.]
;W[eh];B[di]C[G : this is not useful right now : White is connected. You lose a possibly useful forcing move for later, and a ko threat. Better to simply extend at C14]
;W[ej];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ee];B[kc]C[G : good direction of play. I prefer K17, going one point further, though. If you play this one, you're stronger, so you should use it to invade at R12.]
;W[hc]
(;B[kf]C[would a move in the upper left corner be better?  I'm gravitationally pulled towards the center for better and for worse but would like to know which actually is the best move..

G : invading at C17 would be a very nice territorial move. But if you're attracted by the center, it's ok, play in the center. But you should do it whit a more specific purpose, because it's hard to play for center.
Right now, my attraction would be drawn by the white right group -R9-Q10 and R14). One nice possibility, but a bit difficult, would be to encircle white and make a center moyo. I try to whos this in the variation.
Another possibility is still to play R12.];W[bd];B[ce]C[G : aji-keshi again. his move accomplishes nothing but to reinforce white's corner :  this is a "thank you move". If you want to play there, at least play B15, which would avoid the monkey jump.]
;W[cd];B[ki]C[G : you're obviously attracted by the center, but you need a prupose. This move, is just putting a stone in the center. It does not sketch a moyo, it does not attack, it does not apply pressure on white's right group. Well, it does nothing.
Better to play around P10, to apply pressure on white while extending from black's central wall.]

(;W[mk]C[G : now, what could have been black's moyo, is totally wiped out, even though white is going a little far.( O10 is sufficient). And L11 is not going to bring you any territory (at least it should not).]
;B[oj]LB[qh:A]C[I thought this sequence ended well, when white invaded the black moyo I thought it was totally unfounded given the weekness at A and the nasty power of the black stones in the area.

G : well white did go a little far, but if it was at O10, you couldn't play P10 anymore, and R12 would look difficult. see variation two moves ago.]
;W[nj];B[ok]C[G : yes, play solidly. white is very thin.];W[oi]

(;B[ni]C[G : i'm not sure about that. I'd prefer the variation.]

;W[kj];B[lj];W[lk];B[mj];W[jk]
(;B[ij]C[I think both the adjacent variations had better results for black then white.

G : i tried to continue a bit the variations.];W[ik]

;B[jl];W[fk];B[gh];W[fi];B[ff]C[G : yuck You only force white to connect. better to play P13. then S16.]
;W[ef]
(;B[be]LB[fc:B][ge:A]C[I thought that a monkey jump could threaten the life of the entire group and hence pushed down to the second line, irregardless of the silly shape.  But now as I'm looking at it, A or even B are more appealing moves, perhaps only in retrospect to the damage white ensues.

G : the monkey jump is only annoying yose (see var.). I still find P13 better. Or maybe you can find something fishy around R13.
I don't find any good in the A move. it is worth close to 0. And i don't think that B would work (white answers with G16). Maybe G17 or H16, if you want to play in this area.]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[ge];B[fg];W[eg];B[hf];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[je]
;W[of];B[nf];W[qc]C[G : the move P13 then S16 would have avoided that.]

;B[rk];W[rj];B[pk];W[qj];B[sk]C[G this will en in gote anyway. You'd better leave the S8 move as gote for white and play elsewhere. B3 for example.]
;W[sj];B[rl];W[io];B[ip];W[jo];B[ko];W[kp];B[lo];W[kq];B[gp]

;W[jr];B[lq];W[cp];B[ap];W[do];B[dq];W[ao];B[aq];W[es]
(;B[gs]C[G playing the variation would avoid the ko( which is very difficult for white to win, anyway). And as you can see, if you had not played L2 before, G1 would be forcing, threatening H1.]
;W[cs];B[er];W[fs];B[cr];W[bs];B[ds];W[dr];B[pr];W[qr];B[ds]
;W[oc];B[fr]C[G : you should take the ko back. White must win it like 4 times in a row before he can capture your group. And you still have interesting ko threats at :  O1,  E9,  H1, P13...]
;W[od];B[nc];W[oe]C[G : now that hurts, and you can probably lose the game after this, if white does well.]
