There were already some variations in the file at the end of the game. I have not added any variations (I am not too sure how that works through different clients - I use Jago myself)

Remember, what I say is not necessarily the truth (due to my limited skill) but maybe something you can learn from by proving me wrong :)

Hello!
I've played for black, and I want to know where is my weak points and how should I improve.
My opponent wants to know the same.
That game wasn't easy, and it's a pity, that there were made some obvious mistakes (like white losing in right bottom corner, or dying at topleft corner).
I've commented some of my moves after the game and found, that some of them could be better

Thanks in advance, I hope we would be able to use your advices and improve.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[ro]C[al> As far as I have seen, common joseki seems to be W R4, possibly to avoid ending up with an open triangle if black plays Q4 at this point.

al> Further, things get pretty messy - at least for my taste - if black would play R4. W R4 instead of S4 also makes for an easier extension leftwards along the bottom for white.]
;B[pp];W[qp]C[al> This is an open triangle (white's stones). It is not a good shape when the opponent has stones on the outside - it is easy to get short on liberties, something that also happens to white later in the game.

al> W R3 is probably a better answer, as it strengthens the stone at Q3 while maintaining a connection between white's groups.]
;B[pn]C[al> Black gets a very solid wall that gives influence towards the center. Walls are good, if you know how to use them. This also makes the white stone at Q3 to look even more vulnerable.

al> By attacking Q3 black can get the chance to get strong both along the bottom as well as along te right side, because white will be busy defending the corner. Now picture the white R4 stone at R3 instead, and see how much more solid it would look like.]
;W[nq]C[al> W O3 does not help much. in terms of aiding the Q3 stone. The vulnerability is still there - B R3 followed by either W P3, B S3, or W S3, B P3 would give white trouble.

al> W P3 would give white less worries about the corner and also begin to make it possible to neutralize black's wall.]
;B[qh]C[al> This move is reasonable if black aims to get strong in the center. Another possibility is to play S6 first. White would have to answer that, or risk losing the R4 group. leaving black time to play R12 anyway, but without leaving white the opportunity to jump up along the right side, destroying potential territory for black.]
;W[jp]C[al> This move is a little high (fourth line). Black can play at M3, F3, J3 and maybe live, or split white's stones.

al> F3 would be better, if the aim is to prevent black from invading the bottom. This would make the space too narrow for black to make a good 3x2 box along the line. Also there would be no white groups to split.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[mo];W[cn]C[al> An alternative to W C6 is W M3, or M4. It would be interesting to try to isolate the black H3 and G4 stones. Chasing those stones could get white both territory in the bottom left as well as influence in the middle of the board, where black is beginning to create a moyo.]
;B[hp]C[al> Black likes solid connections, which is good because they are, well.. solid. No worries about having to go back later to patch it up.]
;W[fp];B[hn];W[fm];B[fn];W[en];B[fo];W[ep];B[lp];W[lq];B[kq]
;W[lr];B[jq];W[dj]C[al> I think this is pretty good play for 26k (and I notice there is no star on either of you). White has a huge corner down left. It is not quite settled, but it would be hard for black to invade it. In the lower right corner, something like R3 is a necessity for white to avoid losing sleep. White still has the opportunity to jump to T8 or S7 in order to destroy potential points for black. Black has the beginning of a large moyo in the middle right.]

;W[ri]C[al> To be safe, white should have played at M12, the same point that black should play to kill the white group in the middle. W S11 looks like it can threaten the black R12 group, saving the middel group in the process...]
;B[qj]C[al> ...but black does the right thing and defends well.
Now, M12 is crucial for white to svae the middle group.];W[qi]
C[al> well, ok, black has to answer here, but white has better come out in sente.]

C[al> Should be at M12.];B[jm]C[I was too greedy i think, M7 looks better now

al> M12 to kill the white group and get an overwhelming lead.]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[jn];B[im];W[hm];B[gn];W[in]C[al> The white group lives. Black still leads, but needs to count carefully. looking at places on the board where white can destroy potential territory for black. Such places are S7, T13, B13 and around M14.

al> There is also the possibility  that white can invade the top left. It is not that easy, but the corner is not settled yet.]
;B[mm];W[ln];B[mn];W[lo];B[ko];W[jm];B[jo];W[io];B[ip]C[al> J4 should be at L4, appearantly.]
;W[kp];B[mp]
(;W[jr];B[ho]C[Why not to make an eye?

al> Because there are bigger points elsewhere on the board: S6, B12, T13, C17 to name some.]

(;W[ir];B[qq]C[I've expected white to protect R5 group (S3 for example) and then black P3, but..]
;W[pr];B[mc]C[al> then why didn't you play P3? N17 looks very funny to me - it should rather be at N14 to be useful. The only reason to play at N17 would be if white could cause some danger by playing there, but I cannot see that that is the case.]
;W[iq];B[fh]C[al> It was not necessary to kill the white stones yet. Better use you rmoves to make more points instead. If you are leading, try to expand your territory; if you are behind, try to destroy your opponents potential territory.]
;W[cc]C[Now white want to take another corner];B[cd];W[bc]C[al> W D17 would be better. If white can live here, he might win the game.]
;B[db]C[al> good play by black. white should not be able to live now.]
;W[bd]C[al> maybe better if white had played b14 to try to make use of the c12 group.]
