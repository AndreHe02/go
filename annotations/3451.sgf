thanks for review. I'm black here.

Reviewed by Shadow (2k* IGS)];W[pp]
(;B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc]C[shadow: this is not joseki.  White normally backs off to R11 and then S17 and L17 are miai for a base for black.  White skips this and takes blacks base out right away.  So Black should get a base first.]

;W[iq]
(;B[qr]C[$ in fact no need this play, right ?

shadow: It secures a base for black, and takes whites away.  It's sente and you can come back and attack J3 strongly.  It's a very good move  R8 and G3 are miai]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[cl]
(;B[cm]C[$ contact is no good here, no ?

shadow: No  contact is for emergencies or for situations where the opponent is really strong anyway and you don't mind overconcentrating them.  E3 overconcentrates the white stones on the bottom.  C7 just make a weak stone stronger.]

(;B[cp];W[cn];B[dm];W[bo];B[bp];W[bk]
(;B[jd]C[shadow: ACK!  Black misses a golden opportunty.  Neither of whites groups are settle on the left, and  black lets white patch.]
;W[pj]C[$ despite my mistakes, at he end of fuseki a keep a small lead, right ?

shadow: black had a bigger lead when the game started.  handicap games are about small catch up by white.  And he's caught up a lot.]
;B[cj]LB[dk:C][ek:D][dl:A][el:B][ao:E]C[$ i wanted to avoid white making eyes, after white A, black B, W C, Black D seemed good for me,and I had black E later (one eye less then)

shadow: see previous variation];W[dl];B[el]C[shadow: You touch too much, you are trying to kill these stones rather then trying to take territory.  Take territory first leaving the weaknesses behind to kill later.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[dj]C[shadow: what is the purpose of C10?  You just made white alive.  Now white only has a semi weak group on the board]
;B[hr];W[ir];B[fr];W[hq];B[gr];W[fn]C[$ now how to keep attacking ?
