C[My comments are marked "Frank:"

Hope this review helps.

I'm playing black this game and while I have marked locations where I have questions, further review on things I did not catch myself are appreciated.]

[de:A][cg:C][qg:F][do:D]C[Frank: In this situation, I'd personally like to play in the top left around A or so.  If W chooses to play around B, the development of that direction is hindered by the B influence at E.  Further, the D stone will be in a nice position.  If W pincer, D will once again become quite effective.  

If W decides to tenuki and play in the lower right, you can continue to do damage to the top left.  It seems that B might have more to gain from getting a second move on the top left because of E and D while W only has the stones at F.]
;B[qj]C[Frank: I think R13 is very very difficult to attack because it basically already has an eye and can easily run into the center.  Making a move like R10 doesnt put much more pressure on it...think of the situation as if you were W.  I feel like R10 is a bad move because it opens up the possibility of splitting R5 and R10, or its a gote move later to protect it.  There is a fine line between attacking and being attacked.

I am unsure where I should move here but It seemed like a good idea to make a loose extension from R5 and attack R13 at the same time.]

(;B[ko]C[Frank: I think the first problem was that H4 seemed a bit indecisive. Had it been at E7 or so, you could play J3.  Given that, J3 might be a possibilty here too..

Probably not the best move, white eventually lives... Unsure of the correct place to play.]

C[Frank: These pushing moves arent always good..You've done them a lot this game.  Theyre typically called ajikeshi, meaning they kill potential.]

;B[fg];W[al];B[bl];W[aj];B[al];W[an]C[Frank: In summary, I dont think you played that bad.  What you should look over to improve is perhaps some basic fundamentals such as connecting and disconnecting.  There seemed to be lots of situations where instead of disconnecting, you simply pressed softly.  If anything, I would say that is the main reason for the outcome of this game.

Another thing you should look into is how to utilize influence.  You had a great deal of influence in this game that you failed to capitalize on.

Anyway, if you have any questions about this game or in general, feel free to contact me.



Nothing I could do...])
(;B[ch]TR[eg][hh][dj]C[Frank: I somehow like this move better.  W has to worry about connecting the triangles.  If you manage to cut any one of them off, its huge profit.  If you dont, at least there is basically no territory for W.]
