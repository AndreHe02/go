upper left and 20 point on the UR.  Next, you have a weak group at R11 to look at.]

the top gorup and left side group.

tk: top black group is alive. All groups on the board are now
settled, your teritory on the top is secure, you should now try
to reduce B teritory. Maybe something like a, b or c?];B[hf]

i coudl have gone around h11 to stop any connection between those

about the connection.];B[hg];W[ih];B[ii];W[hh];B[gg];W[ff];B[gh]
