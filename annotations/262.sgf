then (a) is the next move. B usually only plays (b) next, if the marked W stone is at (a). Then, after (b), white (c), and black can play (d). However seeing as the marked white stone is where it is, black cannot play (d), and so playing (b) next is weak.]

white stone too much, playing (a) would have split white in two, and given black some good attacking potential.]

C[This helps white settle themselves, if Black wants to protect the corner, then (a) is better. However, I prefer (b) to this move - it moves black out of the corner and splits white, thus putting pressure on both the top white group and the marked stone.]

is better - as it destroys some of Bs eye potential and is sente]
;B[qj]LB[pi:a]TR[qk]C[I prefer (a) - black is still linked, but is stronger towards the outside, and does not strengthen white's marked stone]

[oe:h][jm:i][cr:j]C[White's major errors were the way they responded to the threat and event of invasion. To begin with, black played (b) contacted under white's stone
at (a) - this thickened white - instead black should have agressivly split white in two with (c). Secondly white did a full extension to (d), this extension was weak because white was secure in the bottom right - instead black should have played a more restrained extension at (e). When white again invaded at (f), black again contacted underneath at (g). Once again black should have been more aggresive and should have tried to split white with (h).

White was then reasonably safe, but failed to protect the bottom left corner when black became more solid in that area - this  lead to a ko fight.   So for black, the major point is to not overextend towards positions of Black strength, and that when invaded the possibility of moving toward the center, splitting the opponent should be considerd.

For white, the major point is to be careful of groups when your opponent becomes thick near them.]
