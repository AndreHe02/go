C[Hello Reviewer.  I am white and this is my round five game from the Fourth Iwamoto Tourney on KGS, and my first loss of the tournament.  The variations were all put in the game record by my opponent or his friend, quickly and with no comments - so make of them what you will or just ignore them.  I have added a few questions and comments on the game that might help you to help me.  Thanks, in advance, for taking time to review this game for me.

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt.  At 2dan I'm not strong enough to know correct play, but I hope I can give you some ideas what to think about.

I've removed some of the variations and marked the ones I've added with "(*)".

This game appears to have been lost due to shape problems, and one or two slow moves in the middlegame.  Early on, there was also a futile attack that cost you points in the end.  It's important to have a goal while attacking, as killing is usually not feasible.]

(;W[eo];B[cq];W[dq]C[crux: I'm not sure I like this without having an extension in place already.  In my eyes, the lower side looks slightly too wide for White to keep.
Tenuki is possible instead of this move.];B[cp];W[dm];B[dn]
;W[en];B[em];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[bn];W[ck]LB[dk:A]C[crux: This probably needs to be at A instead, to put more pressure on Black's cutting stone.  It doesn't matter if Black cuts off a single stone on the second line.]

(;B[dr]TR[fq]C[crux: Black probably shouldn't weaken his stone on the side.  See variation.]

C[crux: Let's try to look at the board and decide what's important.  This is the kind of position where I tend to get lost, but I'll try to evaluate it anyway.

Black has two large corners, and a nice setup at the top.  White has two areas with potential; the left side and the bottom, but both have weaknesses.  My feeling is that the right side, while it is the largest open area, is relatively uninteresting for the moment.  Black has a low strong stone, and there doesn't appear to be a way for Black to turn the side into territory quickly.

Black would like to find a way to use the triangled cutting stones which are floating.  An attack on the marked white stones doesn't appear out of the question, e.g. starting with an attachment at A.  On the left side, the corner invasion is also an option for Black at some point.

Black could also think about finding a way to deal with the lower side to prevent it from becoming white territory.  There are a few resources such as the descent at B or the threat to pull out a stone at C, but they don't look attractive to play immediately.

Trying to find a plan for White, I wonder if it's possible to enlarge/secure the bottom side moyo by attacking the marked cutting stones.  Maybe an attack at D would work.  If needed, there are potential moyo-enlarging moves such as a and F, but as they give Black more territory (if answered), I'd hesitate to play these now.

To deal with the top side, it might be best to keep the invasion points G and H in reserve, rather than approaching the top right corner right away.]
;W[qf];B[nd]
(;W[rd]TR[qm]C[crux: I'm not sure I like this move.  White sets up a group on the right side, but that side seems uninteresting to me due to Black's strong stone below.  Maybe directly a corner invasion (variation)?]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[fe];W[ec];B[eb]LB[fb:A]C[crux: Better at A, it leaves aji in the corner unless White adds a move.]
;W[db]C[At this point white looks fine to me.  Your assessment?

crux: Which side I'd like to take seems to vary every couple of moves, which probably means it's evenish.]

;B[hp];W[gn];B[in];W[io]LB[gm:A]C[I come out badly in this attack and feel I should have been able to do better, but how?

;B[ie];W[of]TR[jl][kl][lm][mm]LB[oi:A][qk:B][rn:C]C[crux: This is playing near strong stones.  You could consider A instead, which threatens Black's marked stones a little more and stays away from his strong ones.  B would threaten C.]
