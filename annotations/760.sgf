C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I can't tell where I'm going wrong, but in this game, I felt like I was on the defensive the entire time and never had the chance to go on the attack.  I also seem to have a tendency of falling behind at the beginning of the game and having to attack in the middle game to make up lost ground, whether I'm playing Black or White.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

no2k: Hi Feyda. I enjoyed this very interesting game. It was fun for me to comment this one. You both played a good game. Black followed a clear plan, expanding his right side moyo. White seemed not to notice that, and let black do so. In my opinion that was the main mistake. If white had reduced blacks right side, the game would have been in white's hands. For counting, which is a problem not only for you I recommend a good book by Cho Chikun which is called Positional Judgement.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[qk];W[fq]C[Fedya: I'm not certain whether I should actually respond directly to Black's last move, or just continue developing normally.

no2k: It is ok to play this move. This is because of one main reason. The black stone cannot be attacked strongly. Black can defend it easily with R6 or R12. But white does not know now, which of the moves around R6 or R13 will be better for him. So white waits, how the game develops.]
;B[cn];W[ip]C[no2k: Normal is first sliding with D2 if white makes a 2stone extension. But this move is also good.]
;B[qn]C[no2k: Not a good move. This stone is secure. In the beginning corner moves are most valuable.]
;W[fc]C[Fedya: I think this move was a mistake.  I think I should have played something in the area of O4 instead to settle my group in the bottom right.  After that, however, Black would be able to play something around R12.  This is why I wonder whether I should have responded immediately to Black's play at R9.

no2k: Again, your decision was of F3 was quite right. And this move at F17 is good too. Your Q3 stone cannot be attacked severely.]
;B[df];W[id];B[ec];W[fd];B[cc]C[no2k: Big move, but slow. The shape move for defendig the corner is at E18. This secures the corner too.]
;W[qf]C[Fedya: Looking now, I think I should have played at R13 or maybe even R12.  But I was afraid of Black splitting that stone and the one at Q16.

no2k: Don't hang too much on one stone. It is possible to play at R12 or R13, see var. But I think there are bigger moves on the board. I would prefer a move like N4 or perhaps Q5.]
;B[qh]C[no2k: Bad move. This move runs into white. There is no follow up. This move is big (12 points), and has to be played when the opening ends. Far bigger moves are at R17 (if someone wants to invade) or D2 (if someone wants to defend territory) or O17 (to split white's top) or G5 and G14 (to create a moyo).]

(;W[cj]TR[cj][pq]C[Fedya: A stronger player once gave me the advice not to have more than one weak group on the board at any one time.  The problem here is that while C10 probably gives me two weak groups (C10 and Q3), I feel as though I have to play here before Black does, or else Black will take the entire left side.

no2k: This advice is very good. But your feeling is not quite right. Black cannot close the left side with one move. See var.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[fr];W[gr];B[ch];W[cm]C[no2k: Good. Attach to defend. An alternative is C8.]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[nq];W[lq]C[Fedya: This is another mistake.  I've been told that when faced with the choice of playing from two sides, play from the weaker side, since the extra stone should shore up your weaker group.  In this case, I should have played around R5 or P5, I think.

no2k: Play from the weaker side. I would prefer R5. Black is already strong there. It is a good idea to make strong stones even stronger. White gets a lot more territory then. Suppose w R5, b Q5, w R4. But there is a slight problem with this, black can slide with L3. So your move is not bad. If you are sure that the Q3 stone can look after itself, this is a good way of playing.]
;B[oq]C[no2k: Bad move. Simply O5 or P5. and white must defend.]

(;W[pp]C[no2k: Heavy. I prefer Q5. See var.];B[no];W[mc]C[no2k: Bad move for 2 reasons. You cannot tenuki. The white corner stones will probably die. The second reason is that you cannot defend much territory there, because the white corner is still open. Black can invade there (R17).]

(;B[jc]C[Fedya: This looks like it should be too deep to survive, and whenever I try to invade this deep, it always seems to end in disaster.  However, I don't know how to refute this move.

no2k: I don't hink, that this black stone can be killed. See next move var.
First of all black should kill the lower right. S4 seems very severe. But S2 is also possible. But before doing so he should reduce white at the top. I would prefer M16. See var.]

(;W[ic]C[no2k: Good move. You cannot kill black. An alternative is to connect your stones. with K16. See var.]
;B[jd];W[je]C[no2k: Good.];B[ld];W[md]C[no2k: Good Now your corner is nearly secure.]
;B[ke];W[jf]C[no2k: White is stronger than black here. Perhaps a stronger attack gives a better result. But white must be careful.]
;B[me];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[kf]C[no2k: Better at N12.];W[jg]
C[no2k: Very good. White secured a big corner, and black is not quite alive.]
;B[lc]LB[jj:C][pj:D][dl:B][bn:A][dn:F][ln:E]C[Fedya: I think this move of Black's finally gives me sente.  But I don't know what to do with it.  I know this may sound odd, but I can't even tell where the biggest points on the board are.  I've marked a couple of guesses, but I wouldn't be bale to tell you what makes any of these moves bigger or smaller than any of the others.

no2k: First of all look at all the stones. If they seem all secure, you can think of making big moves. But they are not. The black M17 and O3 groups are not quit alive. Your J17 group is not too, and your Q3 and C8 stones are not. The weakest group is Q3. So I would try to defend with Q6 cutting black into two.   A is a big endgame move. Its not endgame now.  B is a good defending move. I would test blacks respond on F.  C virtually connects two of your groups but makes no territory.  D is a good reducing move.  E is a good moyo move, which restricts blacks moyo on the right side.   But first of all count, count and count once more. You should know, whether to play aggressively or secure.
Black: UL 20, LL 15, top 4, right 10, makes 50 secure points.
White: UR 30, top 4, left 4, bottom 10, makes 50 secure points too.  So white is leading slightly. If you secure the bottom right corner, you have a comfortable lead.]
;W[dl]C[Fedya: I think this weak group needs strengthening.

no2k: Good.];B[bn]
(;W[bm]C[Fedya: I know the empty triangle is bad shape, but if I don't play here, Black is going to play the monkey jump at A9 with terrible consequences for me in terms of eye-shape.  I guess I should have played A6 instead of D8 on my previous move?

no2k: The monkey jump is a big endgame move. White can easily connect to the bottom with F7. See var.]
;B[em];W[el];B[oo]C[no2k: A proverb says: First force, then defend. For example with S4. Then black may play this move. It aims at building a big moyo.]
;W[ro]C[no2k: So white is lucky.];B[rn];W[qo];B[po];W[or]C[Fedya: I think I probably should have played from the other side (in the area of N2).

no2k: No this is a good move locally. If you do not want to hurt the M3 stone you should play Q2, but I would prefer S3.]
;B[nr];W[pr]C[Fedya: Now, Black could respond with something like M2 or L1, which is worse for me than what Black actually played, I think.

no2k: You nearly secured 12 points, so let black reduce your side by 8 points (the monkey).]
;B[rg]C[no2k: Good move. This is sente for both sides.];W[rf]
;B[sf]C[no2k: Perhaps overdoing things. You can tenuki and play another big move.]
;W[se];B[sg];W[rd];B[lb];W[mb];B[ma];W[na];B[la];W[ob];B[oi]
C[no2k: Now black tries to expand his right side territory.]

(;W[qg]C[Fedya: This move doesn't do much for me, but because Black is forced to respond, it doesn't hurt, either.  The problem is, I don't know where I should have played instead.  The question that I asked after Black 47 remains.

no2k: First count. Black has 20 (UL)  15 (LL)  20 (right). White has 25 (UR), 10 (LR) 10 (bottom). So black has 5 points advantage regarding the komi. Therefor white has to look after the big moves for both sides. Black threatens a move around M11. That would be very big, so white has to reduce there. An invasion seems impossible. What about P7 aiming at the cut, and then P9. Or perhaps N13. Blacks group is not alive there. Or K18 for the same reason. You can attack black while securing territory. See some vars.]
;B[rh];W[fm]C[no2k: Good.];B[dn];W[fk];B[jp]C[Fedya: Black seems to be able to reduce my territory with no problems whatsoever, while I can't find the right moves to reduce my opponents.

no2k: This is a prblematic move. You can cut. When black escapes, you run into his territory. See var.]

(;W[jq];B[jo];W[io];B[lo];W[mg];B[lf];W[mh]C[no2k: Too slowly. What if black plays N10 or M10.]
;B[nk];W[dh]C[Fedya: Is this a good idea?  I'm thinking that with the territory Black's gettin on the right side, and the central influence Black is also gettine, I'd better do something to make certain the group in the top left doesn't get central influence as well.  On the other hand, I don't like the shape of my group on the center-left, which seems to be making far less territory than Black's group on the right.

no2k: Influence is only a concern when you want to attack. Now nearly all groups seem secure, so territory is the main concern (nearly). It is a good move territorily. Better seems K6 to me. This move plays on the border of two moyos. You should alway play the moves where black's and white's territory meet.]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[ff];W[eb];B[db];W[fb]C[no2k: Slow. You are alive.]
;B[fg]C[no2k: Unnecessary. This stone is connected.]
(;W[dr]C[Fedya: I figured I was behind, and was looking at the 3-3 invasion, which I didn't think would work.  So I tried this instead, figuring that either I'd get to play E2 as well, or Black would play there, allowing me to play the 3-3 point which might work then.

no2k: You are behind. Are you sure? Count a third time.
Black 20 (UL), 15 (LL), 30 (right), 4 (upper) = 60 points.
White: 25 (UR), 10 (LR), 10 (bottom), 10 (left), 5 (top) = 55 points, and white has komi.
So you will win, if you play sente moves and then reduce blacks right side. See var.]
;B[dq];W[er];B[cr];W[br]C[Fedya: This ends up being a slight mistake.  I didn't read out the sequence properly.

no2k: There is no problem. You loose nothing.];B[cs];W[cq];B[bq]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[fs]TR[dr][er]C[Fedya: D5 would have been better, I think.

no2k: Only slightly. Much bigger are N2, or C11or K6. The 2 marked stones cannot be caught.]
;B[jm];W[fh];B[hf];W[he];B[in];W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[lj]C[no2k: Black expands his moyo.]
;W[bh]C[no2k: What will you do, if black plays C11?];B[bg];W[ci]
;B[cg];W[bi]C[Fedya: I think A11 might have been better for shape.

no2k: You are secure. The solid connection is the best move. But you can tenuki, and play sente moves on other parts of the board first.]
;B[ed];W[hg];B[jj];W[lr]C[no2k: N2 is better. It threatens to connect.]
;B[gf];W[if];B[rq]
(;W[qp]C[Fedya: A terrible mistake!  I should have tried S4 or R3 for eye-shape.

no2k:  See vars.];B[rp];W[so]C[no2k: Why not T6. This is nearly sente.]
;B[sn]C[no2k: So white is lucky.];W[ns]C[no2k: That hurts the left side. What about S2. Try to imagine a black stone there.]
;B[ms];W[os];B[mr];W[ls];B[rr]C[no2k: That does not look pleasing.]
;W[qr]
(;B[rs]C[no2k: I think R1 would win the semeai for black .]
;W[qs];B[sp];W[sr];B[op]C[Fedya: At this point I resigned.  Since the position in the bottom right is seki, I can't get any points there.  I'm probably behind by about 40, and there's absolutely no way I can make it up.

no2k: If you think about the result of the last 20 moves or so, you should come to following conclusion:
You lost 10 points of territory in the corner. Black lost the possibility of the monkey jump on the lower side. It is worth 8 points. So black gained 2 points in gote. That is not enough.
I do not think that there are 40 points. It is of course good style to give up, if you don't see any possibility. I would have tried to reduce, and get some big points. See var.]
