;B[pd];W[dq];B[op];W[dd];B[qp]C[Quite unusual for black to play like this. If he wanted a shimari at bottom right, should have played R4 first.]
;W[jp]C[Of the two sides (lower and right), I think right side is more urgent.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[ep];B[cp]C[The correct sequence for black should be R7.]

(;W[fn]TR[dn]C[This is not good enough. Should cut immediately at D6. Black will be in trouble. See variation.]
;B[em]TR[dn]C[This is helping black to defend the cut at D6.]
;W[fm];B[cq]C[Small move for black. Should have extended at E8.]
;W[el]TR[cq]C[Good punishment against black weak C3 move.];B[cm]
TR[dl]C[Good shape. Many would have played D8 without thinking.]
;W[mq]TR[el][fm][fn][eo][ep][dq]SQ[qj][qf]C[This extended knight move feels small, given the thickness of  marked stones. Should consider region near R10 or R14.]
;B[pl];W[dl]C[JR: I think this was not too important at this stage

You're right. Doesn't threaten black group and doesn't seal black into corner.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[dp];W[eq];B[cr]TR[cl]C[Black is very kind to let you off the hook this way. Now C8 could be used at appropriate time to lock black into small corner.]
;W[jd]TR[qf]C[R14 looks bigger.];B[cf];W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb]
(;W[ec]TR[cb][cc]C[This is small. It only save the 2 marked white seeds. If black cuts at D17 ...... (see variation).]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dh];B[cg];W[fh];B[ei];W[fi];B[ej];W[fj]
;B[cj]C[Bad shape. Should play C11 instead.];W[nc];B[hc]C[Way too deep.]
;W[he]TR[ib][ic]C[Wrong direction. When attacking, should try and force black to move towards white's wall. I think you're probably worried about the cuts at F13 and E14. But black is in white's area of influence, any fight will favour white. Therefore should attack from the right, either J17 or J18.]
;B[ld];W[ne]C[JR: Was this good or bad? It important no to passivly make small teritory from my thickness and I feared Black building his own moyo.

This is ok. black's 2 seeds are still not connected. Any fight will favour white because of the wall on the left.]
;B[pf];W[kc]TR[jc]C[JR: This now seems inconsisten with White's last move

Not true. This prevents black from uniting the 2 seeds by playing at K17.]
;B[lc]C[Wrong direction. should be played towards the center.]
;W[lf]TR[ng]C[Correct direction,but I would personally prefer O13.]
;B[ke];W[je]TR[jg]C[Wrong direction. Push him towards your stronger left instead of your weaker right. K13 would have been ideal.]
;B[kf];W[le];B[kd]TR[le]C[This exchange of M15 with L16 is exposing your own weaknesses.]
;W[ng];B[kg];W[qh]TR[ph]C[Better at Q12. Black then cannot separate it from the top white group which is still not secured yet. At the same time, can aim for a good opportunity to attack black's big group on top which still do not have two eyes.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[of];W[nf];B[oh];W[qe]TR[re][qj]C[This peeping is not good, as you can see in black's response. Simply playing S15 or R10 is better.

But that besides the point. The big white group is now in danger.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[qd]TR[mi]C[This black move is small. Should have attacked white group by playing around N11.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[qk];B[pk]SQ[nc][nd][ne][nf][ng][lf][le]C[The previous few moves have all ignored the weak white marked group.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[jc]
(;W[kb]C[This white seed cannot be saved. White should have sacrificed it.... see variation]

(;B[lb]TR[jb]C[Miscalculation. Black can capture two stones at K18. see variation.]

Yes. Similar to an variation earlier.];B[ic];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]

;B[gl];W[fl];B[jm];W[in]TR[ll]C[Weak response. black invaded too deeply and should not be left off the hook so easily. Can consider M8 to cut black's way home.]

;W[pn];B[hj];W[ra]C[No point fighting for the ko because there are 2 ko's. Black and white will each take one. There is a difference only if a particular ko forces the opponent to response one more time within his territory, which is not the case here.]
