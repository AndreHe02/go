C[Hello to who ever is reviewing this and thank you very much.  I am BobSmith and I appreciate that you have taken time out of your life to review my game.

CH:  The game was basically decided as early as move 52.
Decisive errors were at 26 and 48. 
Don't worry too much about the blunders and opening issues. You need to develop
your sense of big and small, and urgent moves. 
Try to understand why 34, 38, 41 are good moves, and why 22,26,48,52,66,72 are bad.
If you're having trouble, mail back to me.];B[qd]C[I am white, and this is a game for an internet round robin.]
;W[dp]C[I hope to learn as much as possible from this review.]
;B[pq];W[dd]C[First question: Could you explain generally what the good and bad points of this opening are?

CH: Up to move 6, it's a normal opening for both sides. Just keep playing like this, but
        have a look at the details later.];B[oc];W[po]TR[oc]
[qd]C[Another general idea question: Which approach moves should be done in certain situations and why?

CH:  this seems OK, allthough I would prefer R10. R10 is too good to let Black have it.
         With the marked stones, it would make an ideal shape for Black, mapping out territory. 
         So White should intervene.];B[qo];W[qm]C[Here I thought that if I played R6 he could play some pincer move to take the side but with R7, I might be able to get some of the side before running to the center.

CH:  Bad move, see the variations. They all leave Black terribly strong. But by the way Black reacted,
        he made it turn out in your favour.]
(;B[qn];W[pn];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[rk]C[I think here my opponent could have cut me off with R9, so S9 was a very bad move.

CH: Agree. The normal move is White R9. If your opponent chooses to crawl along the second line
      ("the line of defeat") you can happily follow along the third line for as long as it takes.]
;B[pp];W[qj]C[Becasue of that I guarded here

CH:  This is OK.  So S9 resulted in loss of a move.];B[fc];W[hc]
C[I usually don't play pincers becasue i don't understand them very well, but I like to try them out some times.  Unless it's too much trouble, could you explain the basics of pincers?  The way I understand it, a pincer tries to take away the base of the opponent.  But beyond that, I don't understand.

CH:  It puts the Black stone on the run, so maybe you'll have time for L17 and implant a group into
        Black's sphere of influence. But after B F15, W L17, B D14 Black can settle his group and leave
        you worrying about D16.  To be honest: I don't know myself when to pincer and when to 
        just extend (to D14 or C14). A third option is attaching at F16 (attach-and-extend joseki).
        To make it even more complicated, Black could now consider the counter-pincer at K17.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]C[CH:  I'd prefer D15, leaving no cutting points. Planning to make your group strong enough to
        tenuki and play L17, grabbing the upper side.];B[cb]
;W[db];B[de];W[df]C[E15 I think would have been better.

CH:  much better.];B[ee];W[fb]C[Now I'm looking to save my stones.]
;B[ed]
(;W[eb]C[CH:  G18 is the better shape here.];B[cf]C[CH:  A very good result for Black, caused by your D14. His group is strong and connected to the upper
        side, while yours is not even fully alive and makes almost no territory.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[dg]C[Here I think was an unnecessary move.

CH:  Not bad, really. Connects your otherwise useless stones, giving you influence in two directions.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[be]C[CH:  Here Black is wasting a move.];W[cn]
C[Could I have played something like C7 or C8 to secure the side?  This move seems small, but the others seem to leave too much of a gap from the D4 stone.

CH: I think it's the best move. It threatens to follow up in either direction. Shimaris like this are often
        good. C7 / C8 are inferior:  Neither do they secure the corner nor the weakness at C12.
             Black cannot play C12 immediately because of the ladder (variation). What he might do 
        is something like M3,  breaking the ladder and forcing you to defend the weakness.
        If he plays around C10 now, you answer at K4, taking the lower side.]

(;B[pk];W[qk];B[jc]C[CH:  Good black move.];W[jb];B[ib];W[ic]
;B[kb];W[hb];B[ja];W[gc]C[Here was another unnecessary move I think.  I think i should have played K3.

CH:  Yes, K3 is best. Bigger than G17 (which only threatens to make life) is running at J15,
         casting an eye at Black's emerging moyo.
         By playing at K17 etc., Black has gained both territory and power. Together with
         his left upper group, he is clearly ahead now.];B[jq]
;W[gq];B[jo]C[CH:  With his three strong groups and a lead in safe territory, Black has a winning position. 
         You still got the weakness at C12 to defend. Do this now to secure the left side.
         Or play at R14 to reduce Blacks territory  while expanding your own.]
;W[ho]C[CH:  Not much to be gained here. D11 is urgent, and C/D3 is bigger.]
;B[cq]C[CH:  It's hard to survive here after W  D3.];W[dq];B[dr]
;W[er];B[br]
(;W[bp]C[CH:  This way, Black lives unconditionally. Correct is D1, going for a Ko (see variation).]
;B[cp]
(;W[co];B[bq];W[bo];B[cs]C[Was there a way to kill this group?

CH: just the Ko at 58.];W[es];B[ds];W[im]C[CH:  This revives the ladder, but...]
;B[fi]C[I think my previous move should have been in this area.
CH: yes.];W[fg];B[hi];W[hg];B[ji]C[CH:  Now that your H17 group is secured, it's enough. Making life at G19
         and connecting at G15 are miai now. Play at 
        - D11 to have it all safe and connected and your territory secured (best move !)
        - R13/14 to bring trouble to Black's sphere of influence
        - N5 with the same reasoning.];W[jg]C[CH:  Heading toward a neutral area - not much to gain here.]
;B[jk];W[jl]C[I tried to trap all those stones...greedy...

CH:  They cannot be captured - too many options.];B[kk];W[kl]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[no]C[I had wanted to play N3 or N4 before this move.

CH: N5 / O5 was big for both sides. N3 is too deep.];W[nm]C[CH: Black can get away easily. How about R13 ?]
;B[mn];W[lo]C[Too deep.  Maybe R13 or R14 instead?  Or something else?

CH:   O9, making some territory while forcing  Black's group to react, so you'll have time 
          for R13 / 14, too.
         The best attack on Black's lower territory is at J2, making also some territory for White.]

;B[hk]C[CH: He doesn't even bother to run, with a group as strong as this. Rather attacking your territory !]

CH: he's thinking about life now, as he should.];W[gi];B[dk]

;B[oj];W[pi];B[re];W[rf];B[kd];W[je]C[CH:  Defending this area is pointless, since Black can still come from the opposite side.
         J2, E7, O15 are all larger moves.];B[jd];W[id];B[ge]
;W[fd]C[I don't know...
CH: little to gain, since your group is still secure (G19 and H15 being miai)]

C[CH: not here, at B8.];B[en];W[bl]C[CH: proves that C7 was wasted.]
