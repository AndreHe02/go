;B[dp];W[dd];B[pc];W[pp];B[qe];W[fq]LB[jc:b]C[Usually, the extension in front of a shimari (X) is the biggest
move (e.g. b), although attacking with 6 is not bad at all.]
;B[cm]LB[cn:c]C[When extending like this, which is absolutely OK, you have to
be aware that White still can easily invade the corner. Extending
only to c makes this much more difficult.];W[jp];B[ic]C[Now you see, why extending first around 9 would have been more
urgent. it is now quite difficult to invade this extension without
suffering a lot on the outside.];W[gc];B[lc]LB[pj:c][ie:b]C[Definitely too small. In general:  You should use your moyo to build up influence, not to make small
territory.
Black has used 4 stones to make about 25 Points. In order to
extend your moyo, b would be much better. This way, White has
the choice to invade and really get attacked quite hard, or just
reduce the influence slightly. but this will leave Black with
far more than 25 Points.
Onother idea to extend the moyo is around c, which gves a good
two-wing formation.];W[qm]LB[pj:c][qq:b]C[Too modest.
First remember, that this moves does not close up any territtory
at all. An invasion at  b easily lives.
And if white wants to extend his influence and limit Black ones,
c is the perfect point. this makes it also much easier to invade
in the top right part of the board.];B[qh]LB[pj:b]MA[se][re]
[sf][rf][sg][rg]C[Again, too low. Each of these moves adds about 6 points of territory
(marked X), which is at this stage far too little. Search for
influence at b!];W[nc]LB[me:e][oq:d][pj:c][ci:b]C[Sorry: No!
The board still offers so much space where you can easily get
a bigger part of the cake. White invades, where black is strong
all around. If black is so strong there, just give him this territory.
he has spent so many moves to get this bit, so why not let him
be happy with this. Moves like b,c or even d, which really closes
the corner, are much more worth.

Whats wrong with invading at 14? First of all, I think an answer
aound e would either kill white or at least, if white manages
to get live somehow, will get a superb black influence in that
quarter of the board.
Please: Try to let your opponent get something, as long as you
can profit more from the situation.];B[mb]C[Wrong direction. The black position is so strong on both sides,
that you should really attack.
By the way, the meaning of attacking is not to kill the enimy
stones (although this is a lot of fun), but to get series of
stones onto the board, where your stones make a lot of profit
(territory or influense) while your enemy stones only serve the
purpose to make two eyes or run away. this is good enough, isn't
it?];W[nb];B[pb]LB[me:b]C[Black still uses his stones to sorround territory. Why not let
white play there? He would not have any time for this anyway.
Still, a move around b would have been much more severe and profitable!]
;W[mc];B[ma]LB[lb:b]C[If you want to save the black stone, then b does a better job,
since it makes black stronger to the left.];W[na];B[kb]C[The exchange 20/21 only helped black, so why did white force
it?];W[nf];B[qk]C[Adding (only) another 6 points of territory.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[pf]LB[cf:c][nh:b]C[This move is too slow. It does not help much for territory and
also not for attacking.
A better point to attack the white group is b. But since this
is not urgent, black could still use sente to play on the left
like c.];W[ke];B[jd];W[cg];B[cj];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[Since black has only a close extension along the left side, he
could also consider seperating white by the shown variation.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fp];B[bp];W[bq]LB[oq:c][fn:b]C[these are endgame moves. Until now, there are much bigger points
on the board. Compare to: White b or c!];B[eq]C[Moves like this usually give you 1 point in sente, but you eliminate
a huge ko threat you may need some other time. So avoid moves
like this!];W[er];B[mq]LB[nq:b]C[Good idea to play here now. White has such a big moyo here  that
this was uregent. A move one more to the right (b) would give
black better ways to wextend.];W[oq];B[mo];W[jn];B[kr]LB[jr:a]
C[Have you also considered to extend to a? This is a standard extension
which gives black much more potential to live easily. It is worth
remembering! In the game, white can easily take territory while
attacking.];W[jr];B[kq];W[jq];B[nr];W[or]LB[mm:b]C[If you are in such pressure, better just run away (like b). Usually
this gives you the two options, either you really just get oof
or you have prepared to get more eye-space, since some of your
stones are closer to the freedom in the middle of the board.]
;B[kp];W[om];B[oj]LB[nk:b]C[This move only seems to look for some more points of territory.
If played at b, it could serve two other purses, too: May provide
a helping hand for the lower black group and maybe reinfoce an
attack on the white group above, which is not yet really alive.
Moves, which serve more purposes should be adventageous.];W[ni]
;B[oi];W[nh];B[nk]C[Still Good.];W[jh];B[cc]C[Good timing! Latest chance to invade this corner!]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[da]LB[bd:b]C[No. b would simply kill the corner now.]

(;W[fc]C[Was this necessary?Black could not cut, because of a ladder.
So why not take profit with the shown variation?];B[bd];W[be]
;B[el]LB[ej:b]C[There is a wording that says, you should build box-like moyos.
This would lead to the idea of playing around b.
the idea behind is that you have much more possibilities to extend.
71 does not leave so big follow-on moves.];W[he];B[ie]LB[rl:b]
C[there are bigge moves on the board. what about b? This move is
sente for both! Such points should be grabbe whenever possible!]
;W[hf];B[if]LB[fh:a]C[Again too small. White starts to make territory in the upper
left, so why not play there? E.g. a];W[fh];B[ej]MA[el]C[Now the box is quite small. X should nave been there immediately.]
;W[fn]C[Aha, you see, how boxes work?];B[eo]LB[aq:d][rl:c][os:b]
C[Still make empty triangles? This is not really sente. Why not
play the sente moves of b, c (double sente!!), or even d?];W[fo]
;B[ko];W[jo]C[Also for white t is much bigger to take one of blacks senste
moves than to play one point gote moves.];B[js]C[good!];W[is]

;B[bk];W[ch];B[ei];W[eh];B[ig];W[kg];B[hg];W[gg];B[rl]C[OK, finally. But it is worth considering, why this move is so
much bigger than the other usual sente moves: If it is sente
for both, playing there makes a double profit. Please try to
really understand this. It will make you at least one stone stronger!]
;W[rm];B[ik]LB[sm:b]C[Why not just go on with b? At this stage you sohould look hard
for each sente move. If you can play 5 in a row, maybe you have
already gaines more than 10 points. 105 plays on neutral ground
only];W[hi]C[As 106 does as well...];B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[ff]

If you try to concentrate on two things in your next games, you
should easily improve:

1. Try to extend a bit further and get influence, not only territory.
2. In the middle- and endgame: Look for sente moves. Even though
tey might make only a few points, these points are for free,
so take them!])
