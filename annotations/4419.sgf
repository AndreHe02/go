C[Hello. My name is Mika.
In this game I played as good as I can and it is hard for me to say what moves was played right or wrong. Someone has said to me that don't always think of your territory and in this game i tried to reduce my opponents moyo.
Thank you in advance.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[gq];W[ck];B[oc]

(;B[er]C[mite> This feels just wrong. I'll show you the basic idea why.

mite> I very very seldom play G3 to 4-4 because the corner is so easily closed. Not reacting to C9 made it worse.]

(;W[mq]C[mite> White shouldn't have ignored E2.];B[nr]C[mite> Still playing below 4th line and under your opponent. Your chances to ever get out to the middle is starting to look terrible. Fortunately White isn't very well positioned, either.]
;W[kq]C[mite> Not good, connects two stones who don't have anything to protect.]
;B[hr]LB[de:B][pj:D][go:C][po:E][cq:A]C[mite> Way too small a move. My preferred moves from A to E.]
;W[qj];B[qn];W[qg];B[jc]C[mite> I'm starting to wonder about how you said you tried to play not so territorial, because every move of yours so far seems to aim at ready-made territory. Do play higher.]

;W[eb];B[dd];W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[hc];W[hb]C[mite> From this point on White's moves are bad because they play off all that's left of aji. Many of your moves were the same way, playing out areas that would have better moves, possibly later.]

(;B[lk]C[mite> This move aims at making M7 sente. Instead, you should simply play M7 because it's sente already since M9 is open. That way the result is the same, but it doesn't play out possible aji. Take this as a principle.]

(;B[go]LB[cm:2][cn:A][cq:B][dr:1]C[mite> With something as simple as this you put pressure on J3, and if white now chooses to close the corner you're free to cut in between C9 and D4. You could, of course, just forget about G3 for now and jump on the other side with A. B is also possible but G3 isn't much help.]
