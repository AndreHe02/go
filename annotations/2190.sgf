C[Dear reviewer,
I played this game as black as 1kyu on IGS.  I felt I played the initial portion of the game poorly, but managed to bring the game close towards the late middle-game.  However, many of the positions, especially the endgame plays were simply too complex for me to completely read out.  I've been told in the past that my direction is often wrong as well, so any pointers there would be greatly appreciated.


Hi!

As you mentioned, you started quite badly into this game, so I will focus my commentary on the opening stage. Your endgame looks okay, at least it's in no way inferior to that of your opponent. So, the last commented move is W116.
The (V) in a remark like "WA (V) is better" means that there is a variation covering this move, so please take a look there.

Looking back on the game after commenting, I think you can improve your game a lot if you try to "justify" the stones you already played. That means, if it's your turn, please look over the board and try to confirm that the move you plan take into consideration all the moves you played up to that point.

I hope this is of any help. Please excuse my poor english!

Good luck with your games

Andreas];B[pd];W[nc];B[qf];W[dd]LB[oc:C][cp:B][pq:A]C[I think BB (V) and BC (V) are better moves than your BA.]

(;B[pq]TR[qf]C[The low position of the marked stone makes it difficult to develop the right side, so Black shouldn't concentrate his forces there.]
;W[eq]LB[oc:B][cp:A]C[BB instead of your BA ist still a good move.]
;B[cp];W[cn];B[do]LB[dn:B][cr:A]C[Now White played WA, but the common  joseki continues with WB.]
;W[cr]LB[dn:A][fp:B]C[Instead of your BA, playing BB immediately is much better.]
;B[dn];W[cm]C[Black pushed White from behind, which is almost always bad.]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[fq];W[fr]LB[er:B][gr:A]C[BA as in the game, cutting at the outside, is wrong - Black should play BB (V).]

(;B[gr];W[hr];B[er];W[gs];B[dq];W[gp]LB[dk:C][fo:B][es:A]C[I didn't actually foresee the sequence that eventually followed here.

Switching to the top as in the game is bad. Although it hurts, Black should add another stone in the lower left corner to eliminate the different kinds of bad aji there. So how about defending at BA or BB, or some kind of mild attack like BC?]
;B[fc]LB[jc:B][cf:A]C[Instead of WA as in the game, White should play WB.]
;W[cf]LB[db:A][jc:B]TR[fc][nc]C[BA, the game, is bad.  BB instead would be a extension from the marked black stone, and pincer the marked white stone as well.]
;B[db];W[gc]C[Interesting!];B[fd]C[Is this right? I feel awkward here.

Sorry, I don't know this joseki too well myself....];W[gd]LB[lc:A]
C[Black played BA now, but settling his three stones at the left first looks more natural.]
;B[lc]LB[fb:B][fe:A]C[Instead of WA, the game, White should play WB now, ruining Blacks shape.]
;W[fe];B[cc];W[cd];B[fb]C[Very good! Black settles himself in good shape here.]
;W[ep]LB[fo:A][dr:B]C[Capturing the two black stones would only turn a strong white group in an even stronger one, so defending with BB (instead of the game move BA) still seems possible.]
;B[fo];W[dr];B[eo];W[es]LB[ge:A][dk:B]C[Now Black played BA, but that is overdoing things. His eight stones in the lower left are crying, so he should help them - BB is still a good point.]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[he]LB[el:B][hn:A]C[Now White played WA, but WB, making profit while attaking, seems simplest.]
;W[hn]LB[el:A][fl:B]C[Now Black has to run. BB instead of your BA looks like a faster way out.]
;B[el];W[dk]LB[ic:A][hh:C][pk:B]C[Your move, BA, is bad. You should defend your group, but even if you tenuki, BB or BC are better moves.]
;B[ic];W[fj]LB[hj:B][gl:A][hm:C]C[I get pushed around a lot here.  Was there a better way to run or am I simply paying the price for the greedy J17?

With a group as heavy as this one, the best idea is to give it up  - did you think of something like BB (V) or BC (V) instead of your BA? On the other hand, It doesn't look that easy to capture the group, so BA is not out of the question.]
