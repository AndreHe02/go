C[Dear Reviewer,
In this game I played Black, and lost
(in fact, White resigned at the end simply because he suddenly had to go, but on the board White had decisive advantage).

My main question is on a critical position during the early middle game (see later), but any comments are welcome.

Thanks!

Hello,

I am not much stronger than you (1d* on IGS) but I have been studying fuseki recently and I hope I can provide some useful information for you.

I think your main problem in this game was moyo envy.  You started the game with a great moyo but then made three (!) invasions -- C6, F16, and D14.  Even with two of the three invasions living, you ended up giving up much of your moyo as a result.  For instance, if you had played passed instead of playing D14, then I expect F16 would have lived. More usefully, had you simply sat back and protected for one more move in each case, then I think the game would have been much closer.

Also, when white invaded I think you got your priorities wrong slighly.  White invaded on the lower side, so you should have turned the upper side into territory.

I hope the review is useful to you];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[pj];W[di];B[jp];W[jd];B[jj]C[I guess so far nothing is special...

You're right, but since this position has been studied so much, we know a lot about what pros say to play next.]
;W[de];B[fq];W[fo]
(;B[cm]C[I thought that White F5 is a bit of overplay, and I did not want White to secure the whole corner area, so I invaded.
--
F5 is not an overplay, the extra moyo white develops is counteracted by the bad aji left.  The best response is simply to play H4 and be patient.

At some point you can consider C3, C6 or C7, but first stettle F3.]
;W[gq];B[bp]C[Good, I would also consider C3 or C4.];W[cq];B[co]
C[--

C5 feels like a mistake, it seems too cramped.

I would play towards D11 first.  Perhaps C11, perhaps B10, B11, C11, C12, C10 but the second sequence gives white a lot in the top left.]
;W[ck];B[en];W[fn]
(;B[fd]C[Now this is the critical point. In my view, the Black group on the lower left can live, so the focus now is on the upper left part of the board. If Black does not do anything, White will secure this area, so I decided to invade here as well.
What is your opinion? Is it the right point to invade?
--
Initially I thought this was the loosing move.  On later reflection I decided D14 was the loosing move, and this move just made things harder.

Firstly, it is too deep, and secondly I think it is premature to invade.  Since you have tengen, white will not win a battle of moyos, so play this to your advantage.  You could lightly reduce (K14 perhaps, or F15), but I would simply play M16, inviting white to turn it the moyo into territory with K17.  If white does, M15 should win the game.

Do you have a copy of 'Enclosure joseki'? It covers sitautions very similar to this, and suggests a play of F15.  It also gives a slightly less similar situation and shows how to use C16.]
;W[nc]
(;B[ne]LB[lc:B][ne:A]C[--
If you were to play B instead (M17) then white will come out, you strengthen the corner, and then white will attack M17 very severely, and you will have to use it and F16 to make sabaki.  I do not that that would be good, but if you are good at sabaki it could be ok.

You could also consider not defending the corner after O15, but white would do a lot of damage.

Finally, playing R14 is not normally best with Q10 already played, but it does settle very fast which would allow you to take sente and assist F16.]
;W[ld]C[--
Given F16 I would play the non-joseki move of M17 instead of the M16 joseki move here as white.]

(;B[hc]C[--
You are going to be very hard pressed to get two eyes, I would jump instead.  Alternatively, you could play either C16 or C17 and make sabaki.]
;W[ic];B[he];W[if];B[gg]C[--
I would have played the C17 joseki first.  I expect white would C16 and then I would clamp at E17, finishing with  F14 for shape, but sabaki is always hard.]
;W[em];B[bq];W[dn];B[cr];W[dr];B[cp];W[dq]
(;B[cs]LB[hf:B][cs:A]C[Thinking about it now, Black C1 seems to me a slack move and Black could use it better to ensure life for the group around F16. Do you agree?
--
Question is, can black tenuki and live? Because it is too much to give up. (See variation)

There is something I see all the time in pro games: If a group cannot escape then the goal is to live but nothing more.  If black can tenuki and live, then black will.]
;W[eg];B[df]C[Here I think Black invaded the upper left side prematurely, before the group F16 is safe. I though first this group can run away and live, but I was mistaken...
--
D14 seems the wrong point to me, white can find many moves that strengthen the side and attack black.  I would have played H13 myself.

After this, it is going to be very hard to win.];W[ef];B[cd]

I think white believes they are ahead and are playing simply.]

(;W[bj];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[dg]C[--
white played this exchange to fix the E15 cutting point in sente, now your four stones are almost dead.  It is also a pity that you have to take gote (see variation)]

(;B[ad];W[hh]C[Is there a way for F16 group to live here?
--
My reading is not that good! I have tried to live and obtained ko, but I could easily have made an error.]

(;B[hg];W[ig];B[gh];W[gi]C[--
I would force at J18 first.  Letting you live big on the edge and killing H15 etc is bad for white, so white will block, and then you can use J16 and J15 in sente.]

(;B[hi]LB[fi:B][hi:A]C[--
This seems bad to me.  By playing here you make J15 less effective which might be critical to turning H16 into an eye.]
;W[ih]
(;B[ie]LB[ie:A][fi:B];W[je];B[ib];W[jb];B[id];W[jc]C[--
Right, so we come to a similar point except that H11 may have hurt your chances in the ko.]

(;B[hf]LB[fb:B][hf:A]C[--
H14 seems to have very little eye shape, 
I believe you are dead now];W[gb];B[fb];W[gc]C[This seems like the end of this group...

Right.  So the choices are resign, or continue.  Roughly, if you turn the _entire_ right into territory, you win by 20 points.  A R3 invasion would be worth 20 points to white, so your chances of winning now are slim at best.  I personally would resign, but if it was a tournament game or similar, you could try.

Perhaps the best chance is to make a massive moyo, tempt white to invade and then somehow kill.]
;B[lf];W[gj];B[kh];W[ql]
(;B[qn]C[--
Often R10 is best.

If you play R10, white will have a very hard time in the top right]

There is no chance for black to win now.  Black may 'only' be 20 points behind but all of white's territory is safe.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[ds];B[ar];W[gr];B[om]C[At this point, I think Black loses, let us count:
Black:
- Lower Left: ~10
- Upper Left: ~5
- Upper Right: ~25 at most
- Lower Right and center: 30 at most, taking into account reduction by white
Total: 70 at most

White:
- Middle Right: ~10
- Lower Left: ~12
- Upper Right:~13
- Upper Left: ~50 + extra points by invading the open space in the center and Lower Right
Total: 85 at least.
