XCMeijin: Hi! Whoever is reviewing this game, many thank-you's for taking t=
he time to do so. It would REALLY help me along in my experiments in Go!

Also, could you possibly point out some good yose/endgame moves to me? I'm =
still kinda lost in that area of play. Thank you!];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[oq]C[XCMeijin: 5-3 move. I know it's not a very common openi=
ng, so i'd like to know more about its potential.

(Also, i'd like to hear your thoughts about playing 5-3 when I'm white.


Hi,

5-3, its ok, if you know the josekis for this move. i don't use this move for my game. If my opponet use this move i try to set a ston on 3-3 at a suitable opportunity.]
;W[dd]
(;B[lq]C[XCMeijin: is this right? I reasoned that if i made base immed=
iately, then an assault at R4 wouldn't be as painful.

I mean, it is to small

look for my other ideas];W[qj]
(;B[qg]C[XCMeijin: I've read that the point of 4-4 is to expand quickl=
y. Is the large keima appropriate here? is there a better place to go?

the lage keima is ok. You can make a other move bevor, if R10 isn't a attack.]
;W[qm];B[qp]C[XCM: i think im doing fine. Corner and side is mine. Thoughts=
?


Ok, it is a big corner. You can attack the two with later. But the black game is a little passive. In this time the game is white.]
;W[jd]C[XCM: Hmm, he just took a big point. Should i have followed suit or =
was my response ok?

big moyos against small areas, it is very dangeros for black.

now you must attak the white corner!]

(;B[mc]C[this is a very bad double wing. korrect is p17. but in this situation it looks afraid too.

Or You can play k17 , whithout w of k16.

In the actually game the b corner is open and you has not area on the side in order to kompensate the attack.

looks for my alternatives.];W[qc]C[very good];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd]

this move is to near on your own wall.];W[co]C[to narrow]
(;B[cj]C[XCMeijin: I reckon =
this was a resonable move. Thoughts?

a attack in the corner is better, I belive

the next moves are unavoidable and th e result is better vor w.]

(;B[ei]C[XCMeijin: As you've probably noticed, I'm a centr=
e-oriented kinda guy. Either i grab centre territory, or I destroy it. Whta=
 do you think?

I think it give no big area in the centre in this game now.

You must into the white area invade in the upper left corner. Look for the examples.]

please point out some variations of this situation? I find it very fascinat=

ok, the corner was open to long, it was a wery big move. the example bevor (d17) is not playable now, becauce w is to strong in line 13.]

ever since it's been used on me about a month ago. Points-wise, are there b=

in this situation it is ok,  only the upper right b corner to kill is bigger.]

You must counting bevor. Actually the game is small black. then it is better you make points in sente and save your result. If You mean, you lose the game, you can make attack with more risk.


i think, b can't live in the w area.]
