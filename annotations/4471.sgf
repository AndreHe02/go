(;B[qm]C[a compromise..looking for an inner wall and a secure corner]
;W[pq]C[unsure how to respond to this

kk> from your move on O4 is prefer since don't forgot you have "strong influence" on handicap GO. play consitently for the influence. On general principle, play black aim for influence (back with 9 stones of influence). As long as white can't enter into center and wrost secure to live there, black should be ok to play what ever move he want, as long as play "influence".]

;W[ro];B[qn];W[mm]C[And this is something I need to learn how to handle. I 'feel ' that this move was suicidal for W against best play..but i do not have the fundamental principles on how best to respond.

I felt that B had a max of 6 groups BUT was B&F really connected and hence 1 group? Were C,D & E virtually a single group?  Not recognizing potential danger at A, and having noted Q5 weak point but countered by potential connection of R7 to Q10, I felt that B had zero weak groups.
White meanwhile had 7 groups of which 1 and 5 were strongand the others had running potential.
So what should be B strategy?
Options considered were O14 aiming to hem in Q14,
N5, pressing that O6 group

We have limit resources, chose either one. And be consitent in the play for inflence or territory.
