R: Hello!
I will mark my comments with "R:" (reviewer).

Dear reviewer. I'd like to thank you in advance for reviewing my game. I played white in this game and even though I won by a small margin, I know I have made many mistakes. I have added a few questions in the SGF.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[dd];W[cd];B[dc]C[My opponent appearantly doesn't know the normal 3-3 point josekis.

R: It will only matter if you know how to exploit it :-)];W[de]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[fe];W[cf]C[Is D13 better here?

R: not really. D13 will leave a very bad aji at c15. and a later attack about c12 would be a real pain.

Your move is ok.];B[dj];W[cm];B[dg];W[df];B[cg];W[nq];B[cl]
;W[dm];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
(;W[bo]LB[bo:A][fq:B]C[This was a mistake. Is the variation a good way to play?

R: sure that is better. (Despite  the weakness i marked) 
W has no need to kil the corner. The outer strength is good enough.]
;B[eq]
(;W[ep]C[R: The corner is weak. you might try your chanche and pull out the weak stone (and fight)]
;B[fq];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[bl];B[ck];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm]
;B[qo];W[on];B[po];W[qm];B[np];W[qi]C[R: it seems to me little bit slow]

(;B[oq];W[qf];B[qd]C[This move is played against me often and I don't really know what to do about it. What might be a good idea here?

R: Your next move is usually good against the corner, however in this particular case double attack might be better. (var)]

(;W[nc]TR[jc][kc][lc]C[R: now Black may play a pincer and make a good extension for his/her wall. W stone and black corner is equally weak, so black is not in trouble.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[kc];B[ic];W[ne];B[md];W[nd];B[kd];W[ld]
C[R: it seems to be a little bit overplay. its better to simply connect and next  attack the corner]

(;B[ke];W[le];B[jc];W[kb]C[R: Attack on the corner is bigger (sente)]
;B[oc]LB[bg:2][bk:1]TR[bi]C[R: if W want to take B's base, W can try this. After that 1 and 2 are miai. However its better to close in black group, and if (s)he doesnt answer, kill 'em all.]

(;W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[ci];W[jq]TR[fp][gp][hp]C[R: White can push on the 3rd line. B must answer. Then W can use this outer strength to create a large moyo. (and of course, w's group will be secure)
 This plan would be more effective before attack on the middle left group.]
;B[fr]LB[dp:A][er:B]C[R: slow for black. If B wants to play here, (s)he should extend or attack the A group. B is dead anyway.]
;W[mq]LB[kf:B][mo:A][gp:C]C[R: Thats definitely big move. However, let see the whole board. White has a nice framework on the right side. Another plan (instead of living in 5 separate groups) would be, let black to capture some of the bottom side, make a huge center territory.

W can push A-B-C  all of that is somewhat sentes and get a terrific moyo.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[fp];W[en];B[lo];W[kp];B[mn];W[kf];B[ie];W[ml]
;B[ol]LB[bj:A]C[This move gave me a lot of trouble. I was prepared to sacrifice P6 after a cut but wasn't expecting this peep. The following fight didn't go well. Could you please give me some advice on it?

R: interesting move. I think there is no way to keep the whole moyo. Especially if we consider the weakness at the top side. W should cut & chase the stone, make some territory and build outer strength. Plz notice , playing at 'A' will weaken left side group, and this way B will have 2 weak groups to worry about.]

(;W[om];B[oj];W[mj];B[nl];W[nm];B[nj];W[mi]C[The invasion looked too deep for me so I tried to kill it instead of chase it out.]
;B[pi]
(;W[ph]LB[qj:B][mm:A]C[From what happens in the next few moves this doesn't 
seem to be such a good move. Is R12 better?

R: Definitely. However, considering the cutting point at A (can be played in sente) its not a good plan to so hastly try to kill black.  I think secure connection at B is the best. Black will have hard time.]

;B[mg];W[pj]C[R: Small too. B should ignore. There are much biger moves.]
;B[oi];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[pc]LB[qb:A]C[R: strange move. There is a nice opportunity for W at A. See var.]

Thanks again for reviewing this game.



R: nice game. In general my advice is try to be a little more flexible. You dont have to invade everywhere and struggle to make living groups. (See, U have 5 groups!)
Sometimes its better to let your opponent to get some points, build (outer) strength and harvest later.]
