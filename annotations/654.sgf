C[To  the reviewer:

One of the big problems I have when I play is that I seem to have a "blind  spot" when it comes to attacking or reducing my opponents' moyos.  I can  face a position where it's clear that the right idea is to play something to  reduce my opponent's moyo, but I can't find any good moves to do it no  matter how much I look.  This game is an excellent example of this.  Black  develops a large moyo from his shimari in the bottom left (largely because I  don't know how to go about attacking an opponent's shimari), and because I  have no idea how to reduce the moyo, the only strategy I can come up with is  to try to engage my opponent in risky attacks elsewhere on the board in a  desperate attempt to make up the territory.  I ended up with weak groups  that my opponent could attack, eventually losing one outright.

Thank you in advance for reviewing the game!

As an aside -- this is not such a good move for black.  It doesn't really  acomplish anything, except force w to conect at c17.  This is exactly what w  wants to do. :-)

d16 destroys all potential in the corner, and gets absolutely nothing for  black.  Blacks two stones don't even gain a liberty!

You should sing with joy when you see this move! :-)];W[cc]
C[
Excellent! Punish b for his foolishness!];B[ic]C[
Better for b just to move here first, and forget all about d16!  :-)]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[op];B[eq]C[Fedya: I'm not certain how I should respond to  this, if at all -- should I just continue what would be White's normal  development?  Black's shimari looks big to me, especially in light of  Black's next move.]
;W[kq]C[
I see what you mean!

To start with, l3 isn't the right move.  I think w needs to play around c10  now.   This blocks the extension from b's shimari, and begins to make some  profit.

The fear of playing at c10 is that you feel the p3 stones are heavy. No  fear! Remember, b missed a move in the joseki to play e3 -- that means you  have some aji somewhere in the lower right.  I don't pretend to know the  best sequence -- I do know the joseki would be over if there wasn't  something left for w.

if i were w i would definitely c10.  if b approched closely to my p3 stones,  i'd r5 to seal him in the corner, building thickness to attack the approach  stone.  if b jumped up the right side, i would extend to l3/l4.]
;B[iq]C[Fedya: The problem I have is that I couldn't really play any  furthre over than L3, or else I'd risk a splitting attack from Black.  As it  is, Black's beginning to build a nice moyo that I just don't know how to  reduce.

traveller: I think this is probably a mistake for b.  If I was b, I'd extend  to d10.  It makes a bigger moyo, and limits the development of the d14  stone.  j3 does take some territory, and limits the development of l3 -- but  the scope of territory is smaller than c10.  Also, l3 can't expand further  than h3 safely, so it's not attractive extenstion for w at this stage.]
;W[qk]C[Fedya: I'm not exactly certain how to play here.  After a lot of  thought, I decided to try to confine Black to a small amount of territory in  the bottom right.  Should I have played a shimari in the top right instead?


traveller: Right idea! Wrong move. :-(

r5 works nice.  makes the corner very very small, and w makes some nice  thickness.

r9 is far too kind to b.  b can still make r6 for a large corner + threat to  break into center, tearing w in two.]
;B[qe]C[I think b should r6 or q6 here.    that would make r9 just look silly.  it slices his upper and lower groups  in half, creating potential for mischeif later.  it also creates a  respectable amount of territory in the corner.

if w then protects his upper corner, b is happy to take d10 (still huge) or  jump out from r6.]
;W[mc]C[im not sure if this is correct.

the problem is that be can still come into your corner at s17, and you've no  more room for extension on the top.  this seriously limits potential for  profit.  also, the b stone can extend down to r12, make some territory and  start putting pressure on r9.

my inclination would be to s13 here.  if be jumps up, then make n17.  if he  takes the corner, the seal him in.]
;B[qi]C[Good for black.

Needs to worry a bit about r13 invasion, If w had another stone at r5, the  invasion at r13 would probably be a great move.  as it is, w has to worry  about counter attack on r9.

still, if i were black, I might prefer to play s17 first.];W[qn]
C[why not  r5?];B[qo];W[pn]C[
got him sealed in! this is good!];B[cl]C[Fedya: Now I'm in much bigger trouble, I think.  I've looked, but I  can't figure out where I should play to reduce Black's moyo.  The best I can  think of ar G3 and C6, but I don't think either works.

traveller: b makes the wrong move here.  he should extend further out to c10  i think.  this formation is a bit cramped.  c10 has been looming in the  background for along time. :-(

c10 makes bigger moyo for b, it also makes it hard for w to get a decent  extension from his d14 stone to take territory on the side.  this  relationship is why c10 was so important.  after b made the shimari, a play  by either side at c10 is a good move.

for reduction -- you're right, c6 and g6 are not so hot.  e5 is one  possibility.  the idea is to play lightly and slip away.

h4 is another possibility.  threaten to cut off the j3 stone, and make some  formation that can jump out.  maybe w h4, b h3, w g4, b g3, w h6? this would  probably come under attack though.

b4 is an interesting move that i don't understand.  it sets up possible  forcing moves for later.

anyway -- the idea with reducing this moyo is to find a way to escape to  some of your other stones, without weaking your other stones.  don't be  afraid to leave stones behind, either! (for example, if you found some  forcing combo starting with b4)]

(;W[ci]C[reasonable move.  this makes some territory for your w stones.  it  also gives you an anchor point to run too if you reduce the b  moyo.]
;B[rc]C[Fedya: And Black attacks on the other side of the board too.

traveller: yes, this is a good move for b.

let's counf points.  w has

upper left: 22 solid points.

lower right: about 15 points on both sides of the b corner.  decent  thickness potentially worth another 30.

upper right: weak group, needs immediate attention.  about 10points.

So -- you've got about 50 points, plus komi, plus some promising thickness  in the lower right.

black has

upper left: maybe 10 points.  not much potential once w settles n17 group --  w is to strong all around.  needs one more move someday to be absolutely  alive.

upper right: ~12 points.  potential for another 5 more in corner.  probably  no signifcant territory by jumping out -- but maybe can limit w territory  below and above.

lower right: ~12 points.

lower left:  ~30 points + a great moyo.

black has 64 points, plus potential at least as good as w.  this is an  uphill battle. :-(]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[pe];B[qc];W[pd];B[qf]C[
this is a pretty interesting idea.  it seals threatens to seal b in to the  side, makes w stronger.  im not sure if this is good or not -- but it's got  the right spirit!]
;W[pg]C[Fedya: I'm pretty much lost for ideas here.

traveller: this is not so good.  it just pretty much begs b to cut you in  pieces.

things could be interesting if you came from the other direction though --  maybe q11? q10? the idea being to increase your thickness below.  make a  moyo of your own to compete with blacks.

if you play at q11/q10, b gets no new terriotry by jumping out from the  q11/q14 group because w can attack from below.  so you make thickness below,  and b has to play moves that gain no points, or you get thickness across  entire right side!]
;B[qg];W[qh]C[Fedya: I felt like I needed to do  *something* to reduce the amount of territory Black can get on the right.   As it stands, White and Black appear to be about equal on the top of the  board and on the left side, but it looks like Black has a big lead at the  bottom and on the right side.

traveller: again -- right spirit! wrong technique. :-(

i'd say q10 or p10 at this point.

I'd still suggest];B[pf];W[ph];B[of]C[. . . now you're starting to get into trouble big time.  :-(]
;W[jb]C[Fedya: Since Black is beginning to jump out into the center with  P14, I think I need to do something to get more territory someplace on the  board.  This was my guess, but I don't think it's very good.  Then again, I  don't think I can come up with anything better.

traveller -- well -- your q15 stones are starting to feel pretty weak.  i  think a better move at this point is s12.  r12 stones are also very weak --  to win both r12 and q15 must live.  r12 is weaker, plus descent to s12 cuts  off r11 and makes some territory for w.

q15 could still probably either extend for life, or play n15-ish to run for  the center.]
;B[rh]C[
r12 is the right idea -- but it's a bit soon for b.  if b plays q10 first, w  has real difficulties.

after q10, b either chops w by catching a stone, or escapes to the center,  erasing w thickness.  as it is, r12 immediately sets up a weakness that you  take advantage of brilliantly!]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[pk];W[rk]TR[pk]C[Fedya:  At first I thought I was going to lose one of my groups, but eventually  found this move that saves all of my stones on the right side.  Because  Black is forced to respond in the S11 area, I'm able to build a net to  capture the Q9 stone.  However, Black is able to use the aji of the Q9 stone  later on in the game.  This makes me wonder whether I should have attacked  at R12 in the first place.

traveller: great move! s9 is not the problem -- the problem comes later when  you q4 instead of p5.

this is good move! with this sequence, i think you again have chance to win.    you're still behind, but if you could convert the thickness on the right  to territory, and reduce bs moyo some, you'd have it made.]
;B[ri];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol];B[ql];W[rl]C[ . . . still good!];B[po]
C[
this is pretty silly move for b actually.  basically, he's asking you to p5,  which is what you really want to do anyway.

not, if you p5 and b p6, o6 kills p6 no problem.];W[pp]C[Fedya: I think P5  would have been better here, in order to prevent Black from running out into  the center.

trav: this isn't actually that bad.  p5 is simpler, but q4 gives b some  pretty bad aji.

i think the ideal sequence is w p5, b j18 and play around the top for  awhile. this leaves you the possibility to hane at q2 or invade the corner  later, depending on how things turn out.]
;B[pr];W[or]C[
take note! if you get p5 someday, r3 kills the corner!

w p5, b elsewhere, w r3, b r2, w s3, you've got three liberties, w has two  liberties to either side of you.  killing this corner is worth 30pts! more  actually, because p5 gives you oodles of thickness too.

if you ever get sente, then p5 is the only move!];B[ib]C[good for b - shores  up his last weakness.  attacks your stones.  anything but an attack on this  group, and w would p5.]
;W[jc];B[jd]C[
not so good for b i think.  can't put my finger on it and i can't find a  sequence that goes bad -- but it feels like this might give some forcing  moves to w against b's group.

b should probably just j16 for life, and then if w misses p5, b should take  it.]
;W[kd];B[nd]C[pretty worthless move for b.  forces w to live, which is  exactly what w wants to do.

the idea in a situation like this is to wait.  maybe some ladder will come  up later, or be will get some more stones somehow that lets him kill w.  or  maybe he can just use moves against the group for ko.  point is, w can't get  points by moving out, black gets none by sealing w in prematurely, so he's  just losing potential and sente.

if b does want to do something against w here, q18 is the right direction.   b q18, w p18, b r18, w p17.  b picks up points in sente and reduce w  territory.]
;W[nc];B[od];W[oc];B[oe]C[
this is just an absurd move for b.  he should play p5, without question.   p15 connects two stones out -- p5 breaks into the center, and destroys w's  only hope for significant territory outside of the upper left.]
;W[je]C[
p5 is the only move here.  it's sente against the cornere (r3) and it gives  great thickness.

k15 just invites b to do what he wants, protect his j16 cut.

if you want to make  move here, j16 is the move, not k15.

w j16, if b k15 then w h16, b g17, w h14 and you've got a splitting attack  going.  if b doesn't k15 you, take the stone and are happy.

so -- the proper sequence is probably
w p5, b r3, w j16.];B[ie]C[b should j16 here.

if then w j15, b h15 is sufficient because it's sente due to cut at  l15.]
;W[id]C[
good! :-) punish!];B[hd];W[if]C[
connect at k16 is better.  then you either get cut at h15, or you get to  play h15.

also, you protect cut at l17 forever.];B[jd];W[kf]C[
i would connect at l15 here. if the b k14 the ladder works for you.  even if  the ladder didn't work, w h15, b j16, w h14 is a reasonable combo.]
;B[le]
(;W[ld]C[Fedya: Here I probably should have played at L15 instead.

traveller: probably . ..  l14 is what screwed you worse though.  and before  that failing to cut at j16.]
;B[ke];W[id];B[pm]C[
. . . this is a ko you can't  win.];W[om];B[jd];W[me];B[jf]
;W[lf];B[je];W[md]C[
p5 is much bigger than this.  even after he cuts at n16 and you protect your  k18 stones, b still needs another move to completely kill m14 stones.]
;B[jg];W[mf]C[Fedya: And now Black should be able to use the stone at K13 to stop  me from getting much territory with the central "influence" I have.  But I  don't think that sacrificing the L14-M14 group would have helped either.   Should I have just tried to connect J14 out to D14?

traveller - l14 is miniscule.  instead of n14 imagine . . .

w p5, b r3, w m11.  you're threating to connect the l14 stones out two ways.    you're making something out of your moyo.  even if you lose the l14  stones, you'll get two moves elsewhere while b does it.  after m11 if  . . .

b n14, w l8, b n12, w l5 would you really miss those two white stones? i  don't think so!

you must learn to let little stones die! :-)];B[hf]C[
a pretty big move.  p5 is bigger though,  i think.];W[eb]C[
p5! :-)

m11! :-)];B[fb];W[db];B[de];W[ce];B[ef];W[dg];B[oo];W[no];B[mq]
C[Fedya: This  is why I should have played at P5 when I had the chance.  I didn't see this  move coming.]

(;W[gq]C[Fedya: I recognise that this is a simple blunder, and that I had to  save the group at P4, probably by playing at O4.  I doubt it would make much  difference in the outcome of the game, however.

traveller: yeah -- if you o4 then b m4 and you l3 stone is dead.

you're right -- games was pretty much over.  :-(];B[np];W[mr]
;B[nr];W[nq];B[os]C[Fedya: At this point I resigned because  I knew I was terribly far behind and had no chance of making it up.  Black  and White appear to be about even on the left; and White has a small  advantage at the top (depending on who plays at Q18 or R18), but Black has a  small advantage on the right, and has the entire bottom.  Combine all this  with Black's apparent ability to attack/reduce much better than I can, and  it looks hopeless.


traveller: good analysis!

i think you're main problem in this game was that you are too timid.  you're  not willing to play close enough to black positions (like sealing at r5  early in the game) and you're not willing to sacrifice small stones.

missing moves like the big play at c10 are mistakes that experience will  probably fix -- not mistakes of attitude.  the timidity is a mindset that  will really hinder you in the longrun if you don't fix it.  i think you'll  be able to get over it though, when you're in

a good goal at this point in your career would be to quickly count the score  every 10 moves after say, the first 40 moves.  regardless of where the last  move was, ask yourself "what is the biggest point on the board?" then play  that, even if it means getting up close to the enemy stones, or letting a  group die.  even if it's nowhere near where the last several moves have been  played.

if you do this -- you'll probably lose ten or fifteen games in a row. :-)   but if you do it consistently for a hundred games or so, you should break  into the low teens, high single digit ranks. :-)

finally -- you should be proud of the sequence that ended in the descent at  r16 and capture of black stones.  this is great spirit, and great reading!]
