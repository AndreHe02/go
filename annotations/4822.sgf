C[Hi my name is Alfa.
This one is my game in IGS.
I know I play some bad moves and not using some chances, but I think this game is great, because it recovers my confidence bout igo.
I play as black here.];B[pd]C[Zander: Hi, I'll be reviewing the game.  I'm not that high level, so I don't know some answers (and some that I give may be wrong) but I'll try to address your questions and give advice where I can.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[dj];W[pj];B[de];W[cd];B[nj]C[Hmm... Acttually I don't really think this move is needed, but I think I need to play here ^^

Zander:  This stone may be useful later, but I don't see the purpose at this point.  I think playing towards one of the corners or around K4 or K16 would better both offensively and defensively at this stage.]
;W[po];B[pm]C[or should I R5?

Zander: R5 is more common, and this is probably harder to play, but I think it's OK to experiment.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qh];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[jd]TR[fd][gc]C[or K17? I hope this move can gain points ahead, but lately it's not very good.

Zander: I think this is a good extension from the marked stones, and because black is strong on the right, too, it's better to play high here for the influence.]
;W[no];B[mq]C[or O3?

Zander: According to Sensei's Library O3 is expected here.  But I'd say don't worry too much about the details of standard joseki early in your Go career.  For beginning players, your opponent is unlikely to play along the standard lines, and the subtleties of the difference between N3 and O3 here are not likely to make a significant difference to the outcome of the game.]

(;B[lo]C[is this move right? I hope this move can safe those 2 stones.

Zander: Those 2 stones don't need saving, because I don't think white can attack them.  To me this move looks like an attack on the three white stones.  The threat is probably enough to let you extend into the middle, but you can't really kill or even cut them off, and this move doesn't create any territory, so I don't think it is good.  M7 is better to contain white in the lower right and claim the middle, or play elsewhere for territory.]
;W[lm];B[kn];W[ol];B[km];W[om];B[qo];W[kl];B[jl];W[kk];B[jj]
C[or at K9 better?

Zander: I'm also not confident, but I think your move (K10) is better to cut White off.]

(;B[cl]LB[fo:E][hn:D][gn:C][fn:B][en:A]C[This is too passive I think.

Zander: Yes, I think so, too.  You secure a small territory on the side, you could use this move to mark off a bigger piece.  I think any of the marked moves ABCDE would make a good gain for either Black or White at this point, good offense and defense for whoever plays there first.]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[cg];B[dh];W[ch];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]
;W[bg];B[ai]C[Zander: Unless you think you can kill the group at C13, then this is a very small move.  If White ignores it, it only costs about 2 points...]
;W[bh];B[aj]LB[qn:D][oh:C][jk:B][fn:A]C[Zander: And this move is entirely unnecessary at this point.  It is not worth any points - at best it will mean you don't have to respond to a white play at A12.  There are dozens of places to play that would clearly be worth more, e.g. F6, K9, P12, R6.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[cp];B[bo];W[pn];B[ce];W[be];B[ag];W[ee];B[fe]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[de];B[ah];W[ff]
(;B[gd]C[Zander: Black can save the stone at E14 and also save the stones at F16.  It will cost about 15 points along the top (see variation), but letting White take E14 will cost a lot more (about 25 points, I'd say) in the middle.]
;W[eg]C[I don't know why, but my feeling said it'll be dangerous if I safe E14]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[fh]
(;W[qm]C[Zander: If white continues into the middle here, Black will pay a big price for giving up E14 (see variation).]
;B[qp];W[ir];B[js];W[ll];B[fn];W[jm]
(;B[jn]C[Zander: It's better to shut White off from invading your territory in the middle, which is only loosely marked off, but is worth about 30 points.]
;W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[hn];W[gm];B[gn];W[jk];B[gj];W[il];B[fm]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[kj];B[ki]C[I think should J11

Zander: I think L11 is better.  There's some territory to be claimed around N14, and White can invade through L11.  White can separate your groups by extending through J11, but there is not much risk, and neither White nor Black should be able to make territory around H12 now anyway.]

;B[na]C[Zander: This move is gote, since to gain the point you need to respond after White plays P19.  Since it's only 1 point, it is better to leave this move until there are no sente moves left for you to play.]

;W[ko]
(;B[io]C[Zander: For no real reason, you force White to strengthen its position.  You could save this threat for later, and White can't gain a point anyway if you play elsewhere (see variation).]
;W[ip];B[ln];W[nq];B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[np]
(;B[pr]C[Zander: White cannot cut at Q2, so Q4 gains at least two points.]
;W[pp];B[qq]C[Zander: White cannot reasonably attack the lower right corner now, so this move is unnecessary.]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[mr];B[lq];W[lr]C[Zander: Both black groups are safe, so this move is just a sacrifice by White...]
;B[ms]C[Zander: And Black gives back the point and sente with this unnecessary move.]
;W[mn];B[gk];W[gl];B[fl];W[fk]C[Zander: White does not have a reasonable threat here.]

(;B[fj]C[Zander: White's threat is not credible, so it's best to ignore it and play S10 for a decent gain.  If you feel the need to respond, however, G11 and H12 are better ways to save your three stones, since they also defend the groups at F12, G13 and J11.]
;W[ek]
(;B[el]C[Zander: Again White's move doesn't require a response, but if you must, then it's better to secure the stones that may come under threat.  C9 or E10 would be better. The adage "Play away from strength" could apply here.  The big group at F8 is strong, so let White play towards it.]
;W[hg];B[gh];W[jg]
(;B[ig]C[Is this right?

Zander: This is sufficient to save your stones, but it leaves White with two threats at K14 and H11, which would be valuable if a ko fight were to arise in the game.  H12 is better, since it removes the threat at H11 right away.]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[ja];B[ka];W[ia];B[kb];W[kc]
(;B[jc]C[Zander: Once again, White's move was no immediate threat, so play elsewhere.]
;W[ri]
(;B[hk]C[Taking away 1 point, but I think too soon. Don't know why....

Zander: Yes, too soon.  This move is gote (white doesn't need to respond).  You should look for sente moves first, like T11, which lets you keep control and is also worth 2 points (see the variation).]
;W[si];B[mk]C[Taking away 2 points.

Zander:  This is only taking 1 point (M9).];W[pi];B[hi]C[Feel like useless, but my feeling... (for the 3rd time!)

Zander: This is not entirely useless, because it takes away a sequence of threats for White which might be of value in ko fighting.  But at this late stage in the game it's not necessary, and compared to A14 at this point, it loses 2 points.]

But it's ok because I got so many things from here.

Please review my game.
Thanks in advance.

Zander: A good game.  Thanks for the opportunity to review it.  I hope I gave some good advice and not too much bad advice.  Two general comments: 1) try to determine if your opponent's moves require a response, and ignore them when you can to make bigger plays elsewhere; 2) keep the score in mind and try to make the plays that claim the most territory even if it means letting your opponent get away with a small invasion.]
