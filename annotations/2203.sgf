C[Hello, my name is Fernando Grant, Kokorini in Kiseido, I'm 6k or 7k depending of the weather.
I have seen this game and I will say what I think is most important, for black who is the player I was to review, and for white also, becouse the level is near so it can be usefull for black too.

Any questions or sugestions are more than wellcome.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[ic];W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[fd]TR[pd][ie][qf]C[So far so good

Kokorini: Is not bad, but I like more at J15, is more agressive for the white stones and is I think it play better with Q16 and R14.]
;W[gb]C[Kokorini: I think this is a overplay, and even if it isn't, is too soon for this move.]
;B[eb]C[Here I think I should have played J18, allthough this seemed allright untill I got greedy

Kokorini: I think this move is fine.];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[jc]
C[Kokorini: At this point, black is better, white have 2 weak groups and black only one, witch isn't very weak.]
;W[gd]
(;B[gc]TR[fc]C[this is a mistake (greedy)

K: indeed, if you are worried about your corner, then play at F17, see var.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[fc];B[ge]C[K: this bad. E17 is better.];W[ed]
C[This is a mistake from White I think White should have played G17 first and then use the atari (w E16) to break out or attack the corner.

Kokorini: Black have too many cuts, black should play more solid.]
;B[gc];W[dc];B[ec];W[fb];B[dd];W[ee];B[db];W[kb];B[ka];W[id]

(;B[jd]C[This is a mistake by Black, there are enough liberties to play G16.

Kokorini: no, is fine, see var.];W[gd];B[kd];W[he];B[lc];W[ne]
;B[nd]C[Black was now determined to make white pay a price for this ;-)

Kokorni: your idea to balance the board, is not bad, but if white doesnt make any misstake then you can't cut here. So, Dont try to kil him, chase him, and make profit of it.]
;W[md];B[od]
(;W[ld]C[Mistake by White, N17 would have been better.

Kokorini: yes, is true. the var show it.];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb]
;W[pb]C[Impossible I think

Kokorini: yes, white is adding dead bobys,];B[oc];W[nb];B[ob]
;W[oa];B[ma];W[qc];B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[re];W[rb];B[qa]
;W[ra];B[pa];W[qb];B[pa]C[dead

Kokorini :)]
(;W[fe]C[Kokorini: this move is not good, black can't scape there. That is a ladder for white, see var.

even If white want to avoid the ladder, then should play at F14]
;B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[lf]
(;B[nf]TR[jf][mg]C[I didnt want any trouble there!

Kokorini: You dont have nothing to worried about there! your corner is very VERY strong!
So si much better  to play at N13 or K14 see vars];W[qi]
(;B[qn]TR[qi][qk][ql]C[If this is a pincer, then this move is too far from R11.
R8 or R9 is much better, see var.];W[ql];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq]
C[mistake by white

Kokorini: yes.];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[rn];W[so];B[op];W[oo]
;B[np];W[on];B[nq];W[jq];B[kp]C[questionable.... But I wanted access to the center

Kokorini: Yes, but you have to kwon that white will make territory around G3.]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[jp];B[lp];W[jo];B[ln];W[gp];B[cj]C[Kokorini: this move should be made earler.]
;W[cf];B[cm];W[cn];B[dn];W[co];B[bg]C[too risky ? I half and half expected white to cut at D7

Kokorini: D7 cut is terrible for Black. See var]
(;W[bf]C[white didnt so it was good for black];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[be];B[df];W[de];B[eg];W[ce];B[cc];W[gf];B[bm]
;W[bn];B[el]TR[fm]C[Good shape ?

Kokorini: yes, but I prefer F7];W[rg];B[qg];W[rh];B[jf]C[Any other moves to play here ?

Kokorini: I like it.];W[lg];B[mh]TR[nh]C[too close, O12 is better.]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[lh];B[ni]C[may be better to ply N11 ?

Kokorini: the problem is that is you touch a weak group, you will make it more solid.]
;W[li];B[jh];W[mi];B[oi]C[Here I think I should have tried to kill white group by playing O10 instead.

Kokorini: Mmhh.. O9 is better than O10. but any way, you have to try to enter to the white's land, that's the profit you want from this chase.]
;W[nk];B[qh];W[pi];B[ph];W[oj]C[not good, white is happy and black has small territory

Kokorini: that's becouse you are not chasing that group, You have to make something to worried about to your opponent.]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[nj];W[pk];B[mj];W[lj]C[Black got out though]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[nl];W[ll];B[ok]TR[mm]C[Since there wasnt much territory to eat away I decided to take O9

kokorini: is very small, you can eat that later N7 is better]
;W[mm]
(;B[pj]C[Here black should have played  Q7 but i missed the opportunity..

Kokorini, I think Q7 doesnt helps too much, but P7 use R6 stones and cut whites, see vars.]
;W[pl];B[gh]C[Kokorini: nice];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[ih]C[Kokorini: very nice.]
;W[hj]C[Kokorini: this looks as an overplay, is a step too long]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[ik];W[ij];B[ji];W[il]C[mistake by white, should have given atari the other way. The ladder doesnt work.]
;B[hk];W[gj];B[gk]C[K: why not G8?];W[fj]C[Black is getting happier all the time.

Kokorini: yeah.];B[fk]C[Kokorini: why not F7?];W[fh];B[fg];W[di]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[gg];W[eh];B[dg]C[Black connects at the expence os one eye.

Kokorini: that is already connected, C11 is better.];W[dj];B[ci]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[ej];B[ek]C[better safe then sorry, but it seems there was room to play C8.]
;W[en];B[jl]C[Should have played D7 first];W[kk];B[im];W[dm]
;B[cl];W[em];B[fm]C[mistake, H6 is much better or even K13 or any other attempt to kill white's centre group.

Kokorini: I think that white center group is connected, so, you have to reduce white's land.]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[gn];B[hn];W[jm]
(;B[hl]TR[ho]C[Kokorini: Many times, moves like H6 in this case are much more important, and is Sente (you will have the move after this)]

;W[hf];B[ie]C[Kokorini: this is small, think a ko like a half point.]

;W[hs];B[js];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[tt]C[Well that was it, pretty easily won even though I made the big mistake to try to capture white's group right in the beginning.
Things are bothering me are:
- White's large and uncontested moyo in the left corner.
- Good and bad shape
- connections and cuts
- unnecessary moves (quite a few I think)
- any other stuff that you think I need to work on.

Many thanks,
Lothar.

kokorini: Well, leavenig behind moves like F4 (witch white defend late at F3) Whites moyo was made for 2 important things:
1) When you access to the center with M4 I think, you made it becouse you haven't suport in the left side becouse.....
2) your upper left corner haven't a nesessary extension to the side when you play M4.

I don't see any particular thing that you have to work on but...
-try to looking more around the board when a fight finnish.
-and in the most of cases, when you chase a weak group, dont try to kill him, make profit of his pain making new lands or enterin into enemy's lands.

well, any questions mail me.
and sorry for taking too much time for the review.];B[tt]TW[ga]
