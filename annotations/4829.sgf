Hi, my nick is aleten and I'm 9k on kgs, I think my weakest point is fuseki, I always start the middle game from a bad position... sometimes I manage to turn the game into my favour, but sometimes I fail...
I've made some questions on several points.
And I'd be glad to hear comments on anything I could improve.

Thanks for the review!!!];B[pc]C[aleten [9k\]: hi

I was looking for a chinese opening...];B[oq]
(;W[qj]C["But was afraid of black playing here. How should I have approached this situation?"

This seems fine.  Perhaps Q10, or an upper corner approach might achieve similar results.  And I think you can even tenuki (ie play somewhere else on the board).

See variations for some of these options];B[qh];W[qm]C[Well you can't prevent everything.  This is one of the likely ways for black to preceed after R10.  So if this is not how you want thing to go, then you should really explore why you needed to play R10.  It seems it was to prevent an even bigger moyo, so this might even be a success for white despite the gain of potential by black.  Always remember komi.

"This creates good moyo potential for black on the upper right corner.."]

(;W[ce]LB[fd:A][gd:B]C[Your move and A are joseki moves.  I couldn't find anything on B, nor have I seen it played before.  I think B is essentially trying to do what A is doing, ie reach out along the side, but leaving some big weaknesses that A does not.  See variations for the A joseki, and weakness of B.

(;W[ch]C[What cut at c14?  See variations.

"Maybe played too near from my group, but I didn't want to be cut at c14."]
;B[oh]C[Nice big moyo for black.  The choice of joseki in the upper left corner(and the slack move at C12) basically set black up for this.  Its a hard one to invade, but it musted be invased as it is game winning as it is.]

(;W[kc]C[Perhaps try attacking E17.  See some variations.

"Another attempt to avoid black creating a huge moyo.  I thought of this position because I was afraid of being played a pincer on the variation."]
;B[ic]C[Black knows which side he is weakest on, and so plays to protect it.]
;W[ke]C[L17 is a third line play; it is meant to make life on the side, not run to the centre.  O17 is probably the best continuation.  If you wanted to play this way, you should play L17 at L16.]
;B[md];W[kg]C[This is too meek.  Black just fixes all his weaknesses, and get territory for it.  White is just stopping black from getting the whole upper side.  not a good trade]
;B[mf];W[mc]C[Too late for a base here.  These are likely end game moves, unless your group ends up needing one eye.  Even then, these could wait until its demonstrated that black can cut you off from the rest of your groups.

"I attached in order to make a base, but I still think that black could have answered better by playing at m16."]
;B[nc];W[mb];B[nb];W[ld];B[me]C[You've said, this sequence barely gets you an eye, and firms up black's territory considerably.  Best to avoid such sequences.  

"Black creates a nice wall... and I got almost nothing"]
(;W[hf]C[This is very forgiving.  E17 is a weak group; white can really press down on it now that L15 is so much stronger.  You need to make it earn its keep not that you traded making it stronger for black's huge corner.  See variation]
;B[he]C[Black just solved all the problems I found in the variations of move 32, and made some points doing it.  

Now to reveal one of the prime reasons you made the L17 type move, though you didn't know it.  The main reason was to split up Black's left and right upper side groups, so that you could attack one or both.  It was not completely about reducing Black's moyo.  
White played out this sequence as if his stones could have no impact on the life or death of either of black's groups.  White meekly ran out to the centre, and made some meagre attempts to connect, and make life.  White needs to more actively attack black where possible.  H16 looks like it maybe good, but maybe there are other moves to try.  They shoudl be tried out though.]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[gf];B[cc];W[bc];B[db]C[Black gets huge profit here where he should have been fighting just to live.]

;B[bb];W[ad]C[??  B18 has nothing to do with the life or death of either black's group or your group.  It is an extremely early end game move.  Ignore it.  Use this move to catch up on black's lead.]
;B[pk]C[Well, A16 might have been better used at P10 to prevent htis.  

"I should learn what to do in this occasion, it's a situation I encounter myself quite often."]
;W[pj]C[I also think this is wrong.  R9 is probably the best.  Maintain connection between the stones.  Muvh easier to make life.]
;B[oj];W[ok]C[Not sure why white cuts here.  That stone can go nowhere after black defends, and R9 still needs to be played.  If black plays R9, white is split in to three weak groups, and all three will like get caught.  Make sure you are living before you start attacking back.]

"Bad ko threat"];B[ge];W[hj]C[O4 is not worth saving.  It is a mistake.  Mistakes happen all the time in go, but the key is to realize that they are mistakes.  When you do realize that amove was a mistake, then you try to exploit it as much as possible, and failing that, leave it alone; add no more stones to protect it.  

O4 did nothing for you when you played it, so it was a mistake.  Exploiting it is an option, likely by connecting at P4, but I think you are right in thinking that H10 is probably more important.  

-discussion continued on the next two moves.

Continue with the ko threat or just defend as I did?"];B[op]

O4 did not, and is not doing anything for white.  It shoudl be left to its fate in the later end game.  

Saving it also doesn't make any territory in the process, or help L3 secure life.  White has to spend another move to do anything with N4, and black is not threatened by N4 at all.

C[Alright, white wins, but it is a win that is almost despite himself.  I feel white follows black around and responds as black wants him to.  White can not get ahead if he does exactly what black wants, because black wants to win.  It shoudl be telling that white had to kill a group that was worth 50 some points to win by a mere 20.  That is, white was behind in this game by 30 pts, and only won because black missed an opportunity to save G4 at the end of the game.  Through out white graciously gave up points and sente in the ways that I have discussed, and it should not be a surprise that he came out 30 points behind.
  
White needs a better understanding of what stones are important, and what stones are not.  This understanding would come from better understanding of life and death; life and death threats are what make moves important or unimportance.  That is, moves that threaten to take life away are important, moves that keep life for your groups are important, moves that threaten to make dead stones alive again can be important (often as ko threats).  Other moves are important in go, but in this game it was demonstrated to me that white was missing a majority of moves that had to do with missing the importance of life and death in game.

In particular, better L&D understanding would have made G5 a very obvious move much earlier in the game to white, and would have highlighted the fact that S7 was not as secure as it looked.  Black could have easily killed white right hand side group, and it is of equal size to the one white killed.  Black's overall advantage would have been way more important than the death of either group due to the equal size.

Hopefully this all helps.  Please let me know your comments on my review, especially if you have questions about what I mean.  I can be reached at salvor7@gmail.com, or on KGS as salvor7.]

It is also minor sente, in that I think black could ignore this move, and still live in the lower right corner via connection.  

Thsi also demonstrates a potential use for the bum move at O4.  If white gets R3, and plays out a sequence that prevents black from making life in the corner, then black must connect to his centre group or he loses the Q3 group all together.  That means that O4 is situated perfectly to make a cut to prevent that connection.  This means of course that black must spend a move protecting that cut, and white gets sente back in the process.]
