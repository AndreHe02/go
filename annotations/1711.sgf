C[ras: i ask for a comment substantially because
i cannot understand white's moves
I mean, i can see what white did, but how obstacolate him? How i can do better?
simply question... :)

<tomjk> Dear ras. My comments will be preceeded by <tomjk>.  I hope my comments will be useful.
Here is a short summary of my comments:
I expected to see a game with big moyos and invasions (as your question seemed to indicate this). What I saw was a strong player creating confusion with local fights, making some big errors and finally winning the game by taking profit from errors made by the weaker player.
Seeing this game I suggest that instead of trying to understand advanced concepts of how to handle crosscuts and how to handle moving groups of your opponent to go back to the basics and master the concept of connection and cutting stones. In many occasions you let white cut your position without need and in one occasion you tried to connect your stones (move 89) without really connecting.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp]C[probably i'd better not to start a diagonal fuseki
i'm noto so able to work with that

<tomjk> this is a matter of taste. If you don't like diagonal fuseki, just don't play it. On the other hand we as amateurs just play for fun, so there is nothing wrong with experimenting - winning should be not so important ;-)]
;W[pp];B[nc];W[jj]C[ras: i'm too young to understand this move...

<tomjk> a move this early on "tengen" (center of board) indicates that white wants to have a fighting game. Your diagonal fuseki also indicated that you want to cut the board into many small fights, rather than developing "moyos" (big potential territories).
The stone in the center assures (for the moment) that all ladders into the center are favourable for white, so black has less options when defending.]
;B[qj];W[pj]C[<tomjk> white starts fighting.]
(;B[pk]LB[pi:A][qi:B]C[<tomjk> I would say this looks like the wrong direction of play. To me it looks better to play  from the other side to develop his position with the "shimari" (corner enclosure) on top.
Options I would consider are A and B. See variations.];W[qk]
C[another question
what i have to contrast this crosscut?
<tomjk> general rule is to extend after a cut. Here extensions R11 or Q8 look ok. It depends what black wants to do. See variations.]

(;B[ql];W[rk];B[pi];W[pl]C[<tomjk> this is good for black. It would be good for white to extend at P10.]
;B[oj]C[<tomjk> very good!];W[qm];B[ol]C[<tomjk> excellent! Black has a big advantage now.]
;W[pm]C[i thnk this reseult is better for me
it's wrong?
<tomjk> no, you are right. If white were not 4 stones stronger than you in this even game, then it would be very difficult for white to win from now on.]
;B[fq]C[<tomjk> with the result on the right side, I would probably play around J4 now, but I think also your move is good.]
;W[fp]LB[gp:A][gq:B]C[<tomjk> this is a test move to see how black responds. I would consider to play A or B. This would reduce the possibility for white to make a big framework on the lower side.]
;B[ep];W[eq]C[another crosscut
i never play like him
<tomjk> you can avoid crosscut by playing before the extension at E3 or G3 when white attaches with F4. G3 looked good.]
;B[dq];W[er]LB[eo:A];B[gq]LB[dj:C][eo:A][gq:B]C[<tomjk> A  looks like the natural move here. White will play B and black has sente to play at C for example.]
;W[eo];B[do]LB[dp:A]C[<tomjk> must connect at A . There are no ko threats on the board to play a ko now.]
;W[dp];B[cf]C[probably this is a mistake
i allow him to make a base in lower left
<tomjk> the mistake was earlier to play ko and before that playing G3, which lead to the bad situation for black.
Playing now at C14 is not a ko threat big enough for letting white respond locally.]
;W[ep]TR[do][cp][dq][fq][gq]C[<tomjk> this is quite a desaster for black: two separated groups of stone and more cuts than he can handle ...]
;B[dn]
(;W[cq]C[<tomjk> white gives Black more than he should get (see variation).]
;B[bq];W[cr];B[bo]C[<tomjk> this is not so bad  for black, if black later gets to use the two stones at F3 and G3.]
;W[df];B[dg]
(;W[cg]C[uff...
<tomjk> again you can just extend and see what white does. But here your move (hane) was correct. White does not want the result from the basic joseki (see variation) and so he plays cross-cut.
Also white is 4 stones stronger, so he starts complicated fights and hopes for errors from black.]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[ef]LB[bf:B][bh:A]C[<tomjk> this is the wrong direction. However the fighing evolves later, black must play in this situation A which threatens immediately B (white must come back at some point and protect there.]
;W[de];B[eh]C[<tomjk> this looks nice, but is not so good for black. Just immagine white playing the peeps at A and B and black has an eyeless group floating the center to look after. Also white gets more then 20 points here and black is open to invasions at the left side. See variation as an example.]

(;W[be];B[en]LB[id:E][bi:A][di:C][aj:B][ck:D]C[probably not the best..
i would ensure my moyo on left side
<tomjk> this is a common misconception to consider this as big territory to defend. Unfortunately white can play anytime at A or B, also white can play at C first and then A or even D and black remains with 10 points or less here.
I would say the most urgent move is now at E.];W[di]C[<tomjk> white starts immediately with the peep, good.]
;B[ci]C[stupid move?
he could cut me another time
<tomjk> I think the connection is a must here. Else you get a weak group on the top in gote (you will need to connect now when white gives atari - so why not connect right away?]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[dj]C[<tomjk> remember the basics: keep your groups connected.]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[bk]C[bad for me
<tomjk> yes, after the cut at D12 the game is difficult for black.]
;W[cl];B[dk]C[<tomjk> not possible here]
(;W[bl]LB[ek:A]C[<tomjk> big error, black can come back into the game. Why not A? See variation.]
;B[ej]C[<tomjk> good!];W[bj];B[bi];W[ak];B[dl];W[ai];B[ei]C[<tomjk> huge success for black. now the white stone in the center looks quite silly.]
;W[bh]LB[fd:A][jd:B]C[i played a
b was better?
another move will be better?
<tomjk> now black is very strong on the left side. A move a point abore A looks good., but also B is very good. Now as all your groups are safe, you might consider playing at D and see what white does (you might use your stones at F3 and G3 to your advantage to reduce any territory white might expect on the lower side.]

(;B[fd];W[jc];B[id]C[<tomjk> A looks more severe. It keeps white from making a base and later black can attack the upper left corner.]

;W[ib];B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[gc];B[jd]
;W[kc];B[ed]LB[fe:A][lh:B]C[<tomjk> this is a strange move. If you want to connect your stones, why not at A? Anyway you are overextended there. A move at B looks more urgent now.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[nd];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg]
(;B[kh]C[white escape
what i have to do?
<tomjk> let white escape and use his escape to reduce the lower potential territory of white. See variation.]
;W[kg]C[oh no another time i cannot control situation
<tomjk> too many cuts in the upper wall ...];B[jf];W[jg];B[if]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[fe];B[he];W[ee]C[bad result
<tomjk> yes indeed. It seems you tried to build a wall to make center territory, but did not realize how weak your wall was. Then in the end you defended a few stones on the upper left instead of securing parts of your wall ...]
;B[ff];W[gg];B[gh];W[lh]C[now i see the importance of tengen
<tomjk> yes tengen is important for fighting.];B[gp];W[go];B[ho]
;W[gn];B[kp]C[i want to make points

;W[kr]C[stupid sequence..
<tomjk> ...];B[lo];W[js]LB[hp:A]C[<tomjk> I don't understand this move. Why not A?]
;B[hp];W[gs];B[im];W[kn];B[np];W[ko]C[<tomjk> don't let your opponent cut you like this. Connecting is a must in these situations. Now you have two weak groups to look after. It is likely that one group will die.]

<tomjk>First: you were playing an even game against a player who is 4 stones stronger than you, so from the start you could not expect to win this game.
Second: your opponent is one of the sort of players who makes unreasonable attacks to confuse the opponent and hopes for your error (not very pleasant situation).
Third: instead of being depressed at the end of this game you should be proud of yourself, because in some occasions you played better than this player who is much stronger than you (the sequence on the right side and the left side.]
