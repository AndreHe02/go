;B[pn]C[I don't have any real problems with either side up to this point.
Both sides have moyos, and Black's moyo looks larger.  In competing
moyo games, if your moyo is bigger, you should try to enlarge it, and
if your opponents moyo is larger, you should try to reduce it.  Now is
the time time for white to reduce, since black can start turning his
moyo into territory with one move somewhere near O17.]
(;W[pr]C[This move isn't urgent.  If white plays elsewhere black isn't likely
to seal off the corner, and this move can be made later.  If white
moves elsewhere, and black plays something like Q3 to seal the corner,
white gets sente and two moves in a row should be bigger than the
corner.];B[qq]C[Since black responded, there is still time to invade.]
;W[dj]C[Again, if both sides continue to expand their moyo's black will win,
since white's moyo is smaller.];B[cm]C[This should be somewhere around O17.  White now has a chance to
attack this stone and reduce the black moyo.];W[co];B[em];W[dl]
;B[dm]
(;W[fk]C[I think this is the wrong side.  After the peek at D8, white is
already strong here. it would be better to take profit at F4.  Black
still needs another move to get the E7 group out of trouble.]
;B[gm];W[nd]C[While invading the black moyo is important, I think a white move on
the bottom is bigger. It will be difficult to settle the O16 stone and
keep sente to come back to the bottom. There is still more profit to
be made attacking the E7 group which will go away if black gets
another move there. Finish what you started out to do before moving on.]

C[too slow.  If this is really the right area of the board to play in,
then R2 is bigger.  Since black is getting thick, perhaps L4 would be
better, too, since it threatens to cut off J7.];B[kn];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[if]C[These moves look like white wants to take territory around G12.
Unfortunatly, that will be difficult.  The area around G12 is open on
too many sides for white to make much profit there. It would be better
to start with something like K9 to reduce black's potential before
sealing off your area];B[fd];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff];B[ef];W[ee]

;B[ji];W[ih];B[nh]C[Now white has 15+ points around G12, but black has expanded even
more.  Lets assume that the bottom remains white territory, about 50
Points and about 15-20 points in the upper middle.  Black has about 10
in the upper center, about 20 in the upper right, and about 50 in the
center right.  That makes it 80-70 in blacks favor.];W[lh];B[li]

;B[fp];W[fq];B[bo];W[cl]C[At this point, Black has about 10 points in the upper center, 20 in
the upper right, 50 in the right center and 10 in the lower left.
White has 30 in the lower center and about 50 in the center left.
That make is 90-80 black.];B[bl];W[bk];B[he];W[hf];B[hd];W[gf]
C[too small. This move is only worth at most 4 points. Big moves now
include M18, Q13, R2 all of which are worth more than G14];B[qr]
;W[eb];B[fb]
(;W[ea]C[Better to connect. This move loses sente.  Actually, the push at Q13
or The descent to M18 are much bigger.];B[fa];W[db];B[hb];W[jn]
;B[jm];W[mh];B[mi];W[ng];B[bm];W[ni];B[nj]
(;W[mb]C[It would be better to just descend straight down.  Then later you
can jump one way or the other.];B[nb];W[kb];B[jb];W[ka];B[ja]

(;W[pe]C[I would be better to just push straight down from P13]
;B[qe];W[pg];B[qh];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg]C[Black has kept most of the right side terrotory. Black still has a
weakness, though.  This move should connect at S15 or descend at S12.]

(;W[ko];B[lo];W[kp]C[The game is probably over at this point.  Black has 30 on the top,
60 right center and 15 left bottom = 105. White has 65 left center and
30 at the bottom + 5.5 komi make white behind by 10.

I think the main points of interest in this game are the competing
moyos at the beginning.  The think to remember is "if my moyo is
bigger expand, if opponent is bigger reduce."

Also, play more solid moves in the end game.  It is better to retain sente than to gain a few extra points.]

attack possibilities agaist the E17-J16 group.  If Black defends the weak group, white
get sente.  If not, the attack should make up for whatever move black makes.]
