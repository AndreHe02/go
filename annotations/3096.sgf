C[BotanyBoy [18k\]: Hi


Comments from the reviewer:

First of all, I've marked all my comments "Shaydwyrm" and yours "David".  A few other comments on my comments: I am not sure of the level of my commentary.  If it seems confusing, you can feel free to send me a message on KGS or email me and we can discuss it further.  Also, my commentary may seem rather harsh at times - please don't be discouraged.  In many cases you are on the right track, but aren't yet familiar with the moves to do what you want.  I have tried to point out better alternatives to moves wherever I can.

In general, I feel like you played too locally in this game.  After almost every move, you should ask yourself whether you can tenuki to play a more important or bigger move.  Most specifically I am referring to the white group that plowed through your moyo - you continued to throw stones at it even once it was completely alive.

Also, something to work on is developing a sense of where the aji is in your positions and your opponent's.  Ask yourself, "where is there enough space to invade?  How many moves would it take to eliminate the invasion?  What cutting points am I leaving behind?"  Then, after you answer those, decide whether you can or should fix/exploit them immediately.  Usually that's not a good idea, but keep an eye on them, and find the ideal time to play them.  The 3-3 invasions in the top right, bottom right, and bottom left corners are all good examples.

Finally, remember the proverb that there is no territory in the center.  This is not to say that you can't make territory in the center, but rather that if you play a move whose only purpose is to take territory, it is best spent on the sides or in the corners.  Usually, if you get to make a big territory in the center, it will come from attacking and getting moves to surround it in sente.]
;B[pd]C[rasa7 [17k\]: hi];W[pp]C[BotanyBoy [18k\]: have a good game]
;B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[Shaydwyrm:  Thus far you could be a professional :-)]
;B[ci]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move is a little bit tight.  According to Yang Yilun 7p, a 5 space extension is ideal in the opening.  I would rather think of it in terms of where you would want this stone to be if you get to play next here, and if your opponent does.  See the variations.

Another option for this move would be to play on the bottom side, which is just as big.

Note that I like analyzing opening positions to death like this.  Whether you follow it all or not is not so important; more important is the "feeling" that this move should be one or two lines lower, in terms of developing your moyo on a large scale.]

(;W[cl]LB[ck:B][cn:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is not a good move for white.  It doesn't help the aji of the invasion in the corner, and it leaves another invasion point at A, and in exchange it doesn't threaten an invasion as severely as a move at B would.  As the game progresses, you should look for ways to make this move look bad, i.e., look for a good chance to invade the corner, or invade at A.]

(;B[gq]LB[fq:B][jq:A][nq:C]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is the big area, but not quite the right move.  I guess your idea here is to avoid a pincer attack, which you might provoke by approaching at B.  In that sense you have the right idea - white's moyo on the right might get imposing after a pincer.  However, the problem with this move is that it helps white too much to eliminate the aji in his position in the lower left.]

(;W[mq];B[jq]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is a reasonable move.];W[eq]
TR[mq]C[Shaydwyrm:  And this is why your last move is good - now white would like to have the marked stone one space closer, to attack your two-space extension more severely.  As it stands, you can probably get away with not defending here.]
;B[fo]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move is no good - you are forcing white to fix his problems in the bottom left, which he wants to do anyway, and you leave yourself with a potential cutting point.  If you want to strengthen yourself, better to play one space to the right.]
;W[dn]C[Shaydwyrm:  After this white has gained a lot of solid territory.]
;B[fm]C[Shaydwyrm:  Especially in the opening and middle game, you should always try to have two purposes for a move.  If you feel you have to strengthen this group, try and do it in such a way that it has some effect on white.  Thinking about this move in that way, you should be playing on the other side - white is already thick and solid on the left, so any more moves you play here won't have any effect on him.]
;W[pm]C[Shaydwyrm:  Now might be a good time to invade the bottom right corner - white will look very overconcentrated.]
;B[kn]TR[fm]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is small.  Your group is safe enough, and there's not much territory here.  Invade the corner instead, or make an enclosure in the top left corner (which is worth much more in the way of territory).  Note that if the marked stone had been played here, your shape would be more efficient, since this stone has a bit more effect on white.]
;W[qq]SQ[gn][hn][in][jn][go][ho][io][hp][ip][hq][iq][hr][ir]
[hs][is]C[Shaydwyrm:  Good spot for white, although it still looks a bit overconcentrated, it's much better than letting you invade.  Now white is getting solid territory in two corners, while your only real solid territory is what I've marked.  White's shape is a little overconcentrated, but your shape on the bottom is inefficient too, so it balances out.  You will now have to depend on getting a lot of territory from your sphere of influence at the top.]
;B[kk]LB[ed:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  Building territory in the center like this is never fast enough.  A is worth ever so much more in terms of pure territory.  For building a moyo, this stone should be closer to the top side, where you have more potential.]
;W[lg]LB[ed:A][ie:B]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is a bit vague, but maybe ok considering the size of your sphere of influence.  I would have probably tried A or B.]

(;B[kf]LB[og:A][pg:C][qh:B]SQ[ec][ed][cf][cg][dj][ej]C[Shaydwyrm:  Your moyo is still so open in the marked areas, it seems too slow to defend directly like this.  One idea would be to play A and cut off white's stone if he defends the right side.  Another is to invade directly at B and take a chunk of the right side in exchange for white's bite out of your moyo.  You could also play a shoulder hit at C and try to build a little thickness, then attack white's isolated stone.]
;W[og]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is a bit odd - white should be pushing into your sphere of influence.]
;B[kg]C[Shaydwyrm:  Good!  This shifts the balance of power in this area far in your favor.  Now a real moyo is starting to form in the top left.]
;W[ld];B[lc]LB[me:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move is very submissive.  You have to try and cut this stone off.  "A" springs to mind.  In fact, if I had to pick a losing move, this would be it - white is trying to penetrate too deep, so you have to punish him here.  Attack, attack, attack - this is the only way to use all the power you have built up here.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[je];B[lf]LB[me:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  This isn't good enough, since you need another move to separate white.  A may still be possible.]
;W[if]LB[he:A][me:B]C[Shaydwyrm:  Now your moyo is gone.  In all likelihood white will live.  White can also jump to A here.  Incidentally, A is probably the vital point for attacking white, but as long as the link-up remains at B, you can't play like that.]
;B[me]C[Shaydwyrm:  You found it, but too late.  White is too strong now.  You might be better off just defending territory now.]
;W[id];B[gd]LB[hc:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  Too thin.  A is good enough.  White can play the variation immediately.]

(;W[he];B[ig]LB[fe:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move doesn't really have an effect on white.  Remember, don't touch stones you want to attack!  You still have some attacking chances, though white is very strong now and you have no chance to kill.  At this point though, you want to be taking profit with every move.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[hh]C[David:  What (was) is the right way to limit this invasion?
This group cost black the game, I think

Shaydwyrm:  See my comments earlier on.];B[ff]LB[hc:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  In combination with the weakness I pointed out earlier at A, this move is too thin.  White can cut you to ribbons at his leisure.  It's hard to find a good move in this area while A remains, so maybe you should play there yourself now - it takes some territory, and maybe aims at an attack on white again later.]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[fg];B[ef];W[jc];B[jb];W[hc];B[jd];W[ib];B[jc]
;W[hd];B[hb];W[gc];B[fd];W[fc];B[ke]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is pretty small now, since these stones are no longer important; that is, they aren't adding to white's eye shape.  That means this move is only worth the 4-6 points of the capture.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[dc];B[cc]TR[cb][rd][cq]C[Shaydwyrm:  After this move, pretty much, the endgame begins.  Every group on the board is safe.  The biggest moves I can see for black are marked.]
;W[gb]LB[rd:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  You should probably ignore this, since white is alive anyway.  That stone is only worth 4 points or so.  A is much bigger.]
;B[ia];W[eb];B[hj]C[Shaydwyrm:  Too small - if white plays here, you only lose maybe 6-8 points.]
;W[cb]C[Shaydwyrm:  Big endgame.];B[bb]LB[ba:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  Big, but gote, and there are bigger moves.  White should play A next to get sente.]
;W[ca];B[eg]LB[de:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  I think A is the bigger hole to plug here, but this is ok, these stones need a bit of help.]
;W[fh];B[fi]LB[rd:A]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is like throwing a pebble at a tank.  One line lower is better if you want to defend territory, but if you're just defending territory then play at A.]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[ei];B[fj];W[hi];B[eh];W[ii];B[ki];W[de];B[ce]
;W[df];B[dh]LB[cf:A][bg:B]C[Shaydwyrm:  Careful - if white plays A now, you may be in trouble.  The best move here may be B - note that white is not yet threatening to capture your stones.]

(;W[dd];B[cf];W[bj]C[David:  All these moves of mine (black) are attempting to make white live small
but it seems to have been at the cost of allowing him to get big sides.

Shaydwyrm:  The key point is that white has been alive for some time now.  You should be looking elsewhere on the board.]
;B[bi];W[aj];B[cj];W[ai];B[ah];W[bk];B[ck];W[bm]TR[bh]C[Shaydwyrm:  The cut...but you know that now >_<]

(;B[dl]C[David:  d8 is too small, isn't it?

Shaydwyrm:  Yes.  See my comments elsewhere for bigger moves.  Your variation shows you considered R16 - that's definitely the biggest area.  S16 is slightly better, since it aims to jump into white's right side, but R16 is still a huge move.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[qc]C[Shaydwyrm:  This is undoubtedly the biggest move on the board.  However, you should definitely block on the other side.  I have shown a few possible continuations, all of which are better than the game line.]

(;B[pc];W[qd];B[nn]TR[ba][qb][cq][er][lr]C[Shaydwyrm:  Small.  It's not efficient to take territory in the center, especially in the endgame.  The marked points are all bigger.]
;W[pe]C[Shaydwyrm:  Small and gote.  Ignore it.];B[oe];W[of]
;B[nk]C[Shaydwyrm:  It took two moves to surround 4 points - was it worth it?]
;W[pb]C[Shaydwyrm:  I've extended the variation you left on your response to this move.]

(;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[np];B[lq]C[Shaydwyrm:  One point lower is the better endgame play.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[lp];W[jj];B[jk];W[kj]C[Shaydwyrm:  Don't bother defending against this - what is he threatening?]
;B[li];W[lj];B[ni];W[oi];B[ng]C[David:  I'm having doubts about some or all of my moves in here

Shaydwyrm:  All these are fairly small.  See my previous comments for big moves at this point.]
;W[nh];B[mh]C[David:  I'm starting to doubt this];W[oh]
(;B[mg];W[bh]TR[mg]C[David:  no discussion nec. here.  ooops

Shaydwyrm:  This is a nail in the coffin.  A quick count says that you're behind by about 20 points if the marked stone was used to protect here.]

(;B[er]LB[co:A]TR[cq]C[David:  I thought (playing this) I would connect.

Shaydwyrm:  It doesn't connect, but it's still a good move.  In fact, this is a fairly common sequence - the marked stone is played as a probe.  If white blocks as played, then hitting under like this is big - black sacrifices his stone to make a big endgame play (or even middle game if his group is weak).  If white cuts black off, often black can live in the corner with the peep at A, though that may not be true here.

Note that I've tinkered with your variation for living in the corner, and I think I found a way for white to kill.]

Shaydwyrm:  It's not a question of speed here.  If you live, you are back in the game.  If you die, you should have resigned long ago.]
