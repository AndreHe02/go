C[one of my games that I lost against Mats Hjalmarsson (16kyu IYTGG).
I am 21 kyu IYTGG  (It's Your Turn Go Guild) .    I played this game on the site It's Your Turn, without handicap. I had the  white.   I think that the main reason of my defeat it is that I didn't know how to  develop me, in time, toward the center and then, I didn't know how to invade  this center. Are you able to analyze this game and to give me reasons of my  defeat and in particular, to explain me how I would have been able to develop  me toward the center?

well...first of all, I wish to tell you that it has been a long time I don't touch Go, but I will try to review this game with my past experience. I wish I still can help you a little bit. Should you have any disagreement with my review,please write to me at xinhai1911@hotmail.com

Xinhai1911];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[cf]LB[ce:a][di:b]C[I normally focus on the whole game, therefore, please forgive me to comment start from opening.
If i were you, my preferable next move would be 'a'. Why? When I play a, black would probably play around 'b'. Then I can play around G16, isn't that better?]
;W[df];B[cc];W[cj]C[Since we are amateur players, therefore opening is not quite important, but always bear in mind that even though we are free to choose how we are going to play in the opening, but that doesn't mean that we can put our stones anywhere we want, tha's too dangerous....]
;B[cm]C[See variation for white next move.]
(;W[cd]C[Since you've invade at C10, then you should play around C13 first.]
;B[dc];W[cg];B[ed];W[iq]LB[lq:a][mq:b]C[Why?Since your upper left stones haven't settled down yet, you should't have try this move. If you really want to, then move nearer to stone Q4, such as 'a' and 'b'.]
;B[lp]CR[lq]C[try to secure your lower right first.];W[fq];B[dq]

(;W[nc]CR[lq]C[M3 is better. Or you can try L17. See variation.]
;B[lc];W[qc]C[Should try O15 or N16.];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb]
;B[ob]C[See variation.]
(;W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[pf];W[qe]C[Since the corner is secured now, there's no need to play white 30. Try playing elsewhere instead.]
;B[pj];W[qn]C[white 32 should play R7 or R8.];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh]
C[Do not let your stones lowered down by the opponents, white 34 is painful for me.]
;W[ql]CR[qk]C[R9 is better, it squeeze the space and ask for black's response.]
;B[nq];W[pr];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr]
(;W[er];B[dr];W[ee]C[Try F16 instead.];B[ge]C[black moyo become more and more bigger in size now.]

;W[qj]C[no use to play here now. should try to push and squeeze his moyo in the center.]
;B[qi];W[pk];B[oj];W[bl]C[Because you are just trying to secured your territory, therefore you lost the chance to play in the center.]
;B[bm];W[gc]C[62 should move at C8 to prevent later invasion by black.]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[id];W[gg];B[hg];W[gf];B[hf];W[hi];B[hh];W[gh]
CR[ff][gi]C[too many weak point for black to break through your defence.]
;B[cl];W[bk];B[dj]C[shoulld try D11.];W[ci]C[I think that's all I want to say, just have a look on the board....I can say that it's hard for white to compete with black now. You should resign here or maybe next few moves later, this is what I can sense from the whole game. But don't give up..play more....and do more live and death questions can help you. buy some books to study is also essential. Perhaps you can try to find professional go game reviews to study. This is really a good way to learn go. If you trust me, you can e-mail to me, we shall discuss further more if you want : )

;W[fb];B[da]C[Yes, from what I see, you don't grasp the chance to invade the center and maybe you don't know how and where to invade,right?
Study my comment and consider those alternative moves. This is what I think should be all right for you to consider about it. Try not to follow where your opponent play. Always make sure your territory is secure before moving to other places unless it's important for you to reply there. If you gain little by playing that move,then you should not try there.Try to compare how much you gain and lost for each move you make. And...don let your opponent take the initiative, you should try to take the lead, force him to follow you in order to gain more territory for yourself. I only focus on white moves and comment are not very thorough and deep enough, because i'm recently busy with my work, i'm sorry about this. But this is really a review that I put in many efforts, I hope these help you.   That's all, work hard and you will play very well.   All the best!
