C[z: This game is from IGS.  White is 'jonyu', 17k*; black is 'deedee',
19k*.  White won this game by resignation.

z: I ('zenjutsu', 17k*) observed this game.  With the permission
of black, I added some commentary (mostly for black) and I am
submitting it to GTL for comments.

NM: Comments added by Niall (5k* igs)];B[pp];W[ei]C[z: This opening is surprising to me.  I am so accustomed to playing
corners -> sides -> middle.  I would greatly appreciate the perspective
of the GTL reviewer on this fuseki.  Fuseki and joseki are items
I am interested in, but this move is new to me.

NM: The difficulty is ensuring afterwards
that this move ends up in the right place.
I find this very difficult, so I don't
like this sort of move - especially on the
5th line like this. If B simply answers
C11, he seems to have come out ahead on
the exchange.];B[dq]C[NM: I would prefer C4, but this is OK]
;W[pc];B[dc]C[NM: Again I would prefer C16. The idea is
to minimise the chance that E11 will turn
out useful to W.];W[do]
(;B[fp]C[z: I think I prefer black playing at B instead of 7 (see alternate
move tree).

NM: Yes, although the move tree proposed
is not in my view optimal. This move would
allow, after the classic continuation (W C3,
BC2, W C4, B B2), W to play round D9,
which makes E11 useful.];W[np];B[lq]C[NM: Good!];W[ip]C[NM: Strange. But now it becomes important
for B to split up these scattered W stones.
I think I would play M6 next.]
(;B[nq]C[z: Attaching at 11 seems difficult to win, and led to being confined
to the very bottom to survive.  Perhaps an extension at B instead?
See alternate move tree.

NM: This is perfectly possible. B can linnk
up, and cannot be properly confined, while
the W stones will be heavy and short of
liberties. But I agree that a splitting
move would be better.];W[oq];B[op];W[mq];B[nr];W[mp];B[mr]C[NM: and there we are: the W stones are
heavy and short of liberties. W's best
move now is probably M4, to give him
thickness on the outside, but B has a
huge amount of territory and excellent
prospects on the R side.];W[kr];B[kq]C[z: I like that black blocked at L3, not at M2.  However, are
there alternate options that the GTL reviewer might offer?

NM: I disagree. B will probably have to
come back and block at M2 anyway, so
he might as well do it now. But I think
B should start off by attacking the 3
W stones at M4.];W[jq];B[lr]C[NM: B has had to come back. Think tewari:
If B had played M2, and W then played K3,
would B have played L3? I doubt it.];W[eq]C[z: White's cut really hurt black.

NM: As B, I wouldn't feel hurt. More  strengthened.];B[ep];W[dp]
;B[er]C[NM: B is nearly alive.];W[cq];B[dr];W[gq];B[gp]C[NM: Excellent!]
;W[fq];B[hq]C[z: When I was observing the game, at this point it appeared that
white's groups were being seperated.  I tried to explore options
to exploit this seperation while adding comments.];W[gr];B[hr]
;W[de]
(;B[fd]C[NM: OK. I would be inclined to try  something like C11 or D8 now, but it's a  matter of style.]
;W[cc]C[NM: just right];B[dd];W[cd]
(;B[jc]C[z: I feel this stone may have been a play or two premature.  See move variations based on B.]
;W[pj]C[NM: Good.];B[pl]C[NM: possible, but I don't like it. It
still doesn't get full value from the strong
corner. I would prefer Q15 or C10.];W[pn]C[NM: too agressive, with the 3 stones at N4
still in difficulty (unless W proposes to
sacrifice them).];B[on]C[z: This attachment assumes capture of w's lower stones.  I feel
that future moves need to confine and capture those stones.

NM: Future moves will be needed, but that's
OK. But I would be more agressive in my
response here: I would play P7.];W[pm];B[om];W[ql]
(;B[ok]C[z: This stone does not threaten w on either the right, or bottom
center.  Perhaps now is a time to firmly capture that area.  See alternative moves at B and C.

NM: The alternatives suggested by "z" are
OK, but I would start off with P8, which
is sente. This hanging move is appropriate
when you need to make defensive shape:
B should be attacking here.];W[pk];B[ol]C[NM: N had to play P8 eventually: if he'd
done it at once he would have kept sente,
and W would be a line lower.];W[qp]C[z: This move, combined with white surviving on the bottom, is
very painful.

NM: It's a reasonable move, but if B replies
properly he has no problem.];B[qq];W[qo];B[po]C[z: Empty triangle.  This stone led to great pain for b.  Perhaps
at one of the square points instead (to secure that corner) or
one of the triangles (to work in whole new directions).

NM: A terrible move - it makes Q3 sente,
which gives W the corner in sente  (W Q3, B P5, W S3, B R3, W S2). Should
be simply P5.];W[oj];B[in]C[NM: Trying to surround is right, but I think
the R side needs support more urgently than
the L - I would play M8.];W[mk];B[qe]C[NM; No! This is not the moment! Should be
M7, or if B is really convinced the W stones  are dead, O17 or C10 or similar.]
;W[pg]C[NM: this is too easy on B. W should tenuki,
or play O16. Or if he really wants to
attack from this side, R13.];B[oe]C[NM: B is not likely to take this
suggestion having played R15, but even
now I would leave it and go back to the
bottom.];W[nd];B[ng]C[z: Stone 61 is running for the center too soon, and does not
put pressure on either top-right white, or right-side white.
Perhaps a square point instead?

NM: If he wants to run (and I wouldn't),
then O15 or P13 are the moves.];W[ne];B[of];W[hd]C[z: This is a painful stone.  Had the right side of this group
been built up (earlier alternative move) then this peep would
have been much more difficult for white.

NM: I don't like it: it's likely to  reinforce the B stones and not make any
significant territory: and the influence it
will make is of dubious value.  As W now I would: first take the
bottom R corner in sente; then  an attack at R16; and then
something like L7 to get the maximum  out of the 3 N4 stones; and then C9 to take
50 points on the L side. At that point I'm
in the game again. That is a matter of  style, but H17 is not good.]
;B[hc]C[z: I've often heard that attaching too soon builds your opponent's
strength.

NM: Yes, but also your own. This is the
best response - look at the result.];W[gc];B[gd];W[ic];B[hb]
;W[ib]C[NM; W should have played J16, but he still
ends up with a poor result - just like N4.];B[id];W[jb];B[he]
;W[kc]C[NM: OK, W has taken 10 points in gote -
but he's left B solid and with excellent  access to the centre. The only good
thing for W in this sequence is that it's
improved the prospects of attacking the
R15 stones -];B[rc]C[NM - which B promptly, and correctly,
defends.];W[ln]C[z: It is quickly becoming too late to secure the capture of those
bottom stones.

NM: Hmm. I think they can still be taken,
but certainly it's got much more difficult.
I think that as B at this point I would  play Q3. Once I've done that I'm not too
bothered about the3 stones - the R side
is much bigger.];B[lm];W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[mo];B[ml];W[km]
;B[ll];W[jn]C[NM: Should be L8 - if B tries to cut  there's a lethal squeeze sequence.]
;B[jl];W[im]C[NM: Should be L8.];B[jm];W[io];B[hn];W[ho];B[go]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[il]
(;B[hl]C[z: Instead of 97, perhaps playing where white plays 98 (see alternative
move tree).];W[kl];B[ik];W[kk]C[z: Now white lives, and b's right group is becoming seperated.

NM: True. But this should be M9, which takes
the 3 B stones.];B[fn]C[z: Appears unnecessary.  Bottom b group lives via capture, center
via extension to top or via invasion (both in squares) followed
by making eyes/connection to top, or via playing this stone later.
However, most important, this stone ignores danger to right side.
Perhaps one of the triangle points instead?  I like Q3 the most--
no nonsense.

NM: Yes, Q3 is necessary.];W[lk];B[nl]C[NM: Catastrophic! B must sacrifice these 3
stones and play Q3.];W[pq];B[pr];W[oo]C[z: Ouch.  Game now appears to be over.

NM: agreed.];B[dk];W[cr];B[gs]C[NM: Not necessary.];W[ci];B[dj]
C[z: Perhaps a square instead?

NM: Certainly not where the game is to be played. B needs to stir things up. R2?
(I think it doesn't save the corner if W
answers correctly, but may be worth trying.)
C7? Q18?];W[cl]C[NM: Good. Simple and not trying to fight.]
;B[fl];W[jd];B[rq];W[rp]C[NM: Bad - should be P2.];B[rh]C[NM: Having played S3, B must play P2
to hold the corner.];W[rd];B[qd];W[rf];B[qf];W[rg];B[qg];W[re]

(;B[ph]C[z: This stone does not secure eyes, nor attack white.  Perhaps
playing at R17 is better?  See alternate move tree.

NM: Undoubtedly.];W[qc]C[z: Now, b can still get a ko (I think) by playing at S18.  GTL
reviewer's input?

NM: Yes, that looks right to me. But he
doesn't have to do it straight away.]
(;B[od];W[oc];B[nj]C[z: White shouldn't capture yet.  Could maintain capture, and
expand presence with stone at square points-- I like O11 the
most.  Black could have played at another point to make gains--
perhaps a triangle?  I think I like K5 and P2 the most.  GTL
reviewer input?

NM: You're right that W doesn't have to
capture yet, but - particularly because he
is so far ahead - I think it's reasonable for him to remove all the aji by doing so.]
;W[nk];B[ni]C[NM: B still hasn't got two eyes: he should
play out first, say at M13.];W[jf];B[lf];W[or];B[os];W[qr];B[ps]

(;W[rr]C[z: White could have done a aggressive stones (played in a few
moves) from B prior to this stone, see alternative move tree.

NM: I find the whole sequence a bit odd.
W can killed the entire group.
See my note in the alternative move tree.];B[jr];W[ir];B[ks]
;W[ns];B[jo];W[jp];B[iq];W[ko];B[ms];W[qs];B[ns];W[rb];B[di]
C[z: Perhaps a square instead.  GTL reviewer input?

NM: This is not unreasonable. B could  reasonably resign, but if he plays on he
has to make something sizeable. This just
might give him 30 points in the centre
(assuming he can save the Q15 group).];W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[db]
(;B[ee]C[z: I think I prefer e17 (see alternate move tree).]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[eb];B[eh]C[z: This stone seems to achieve little.  To secure the death of
e11, perhaps a square instead.  Or, an attack around same area
with a triangle?  (I made an alternative move tree from c15.)
GTL reviewer input on best move here?

NM: The necessary move here is D14,  followed by a move such as R11 to
save the TR group. But B has lost the game.
No further comments.]
(;W[df];B[ef];W[hg];B[me]C[z: Perhaps at square instead?];W[md]

shows.  Perhaps a square?];W[mf];B[le];W[mg];B[nf];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[kh];B[kg];W[li];B[nh];W[lh];B[rj]C[z: Following sequence shows that both black and myself were wrong
about usefulness of S10.  Perhaps a square instead?];W[qi];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[qj];B[qh];W[rk];B[sg];W[sc]C[z: This move of white's seems unnecessary.  Black could not threaten
white's S15 group (or at least not that I could see), nor could
black get a second eye here, as a white stone at S11, T12, or
T10 closes that eye shape.];B[ri];W[jg];B[sj];W[sh];B[gi];W[hi]
;B[gh];W[hj]C[z: Black resigns.  I sincerely enjoyed observing this game, and
I thought that both black and white made many good plays.  I
learned a great deal both observing the game, and providing initial
commentary.

z: Black also received this sgf from me, and I will forward the
GTL reviewed sgf to them also.

z: I thank you for your time reviewing this game, and I look
forward to receiving the review.])

is certainly OK; but there's the

the top still survives at the triangles.]))
