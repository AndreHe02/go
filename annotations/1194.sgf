overall comments:
try to make sure that your moves are worth at least 10 points until the end game. you play a lot of 2 - 5 point moves when much bigger stuff abounds. especially take care to not play moves near your strength. play away from strength. if you have a super strong group, don't extend a small ways from it. play in a different place.]
;B[dp];W[cd];B[qd];W[qq];B[oc];W[qg];B[qi]C[good move. white approached too closely, and it's appropriate to attack directly in this fashion]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc];W[rd];B[rc];W[qe];B[pd];W[of]C[white has achieved some semblance of shape on the side]

(;B[ql]TR[qi]C[this move is a bit slow. it'll be hard for white to attack the marked stone with a weak group above]
;W[qn];B[re]C[first really bad move.  this is a gote sequence. what value does it have? since your group in the corner is already impregnable, it doesn't help it. it also doesn't really hurt white. and the points you gain are way too small to lose sente.]
;W[rf]
(;B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[pe]
(;B[lc]C[pretty small. this is on the third line, and you're extending from a group that's alreayd strong. better to take a big point somewhere...]
;W[mc];B[md];W[ld]
(;B[nc];W[me]
(;B[nd]C[i've noticed that every time your opponent ataris, you connect instead of taking. while this can be the right move, this is not always a good idea. right now, it's a bad idea, because you give white an extra atari on the outside to seal you in.]

(;W[le];B[kc]C[lucky to get this];W[fc]
(;B[rh]C[pretty slow. you won't be able to attack these white stones. to strengthen your own group, it's better to jump out]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[nq];B[cj];W[kq]C[for some reason, your opponent is trying to make a moyo along the third line.]

(;W[bq];B[bp];W[bs];B[fr];W[ds];B[fj]C[this seems reasonable]

[hm][go]C[playing close to strength again. let's look at the marked stones here. three moves you've made to extend your territory, which do little else. in total, these stones give you maybe 15 points of territory. but three moves should give you about 40. this is inefficient.]
;W[ii]
(;B[ne]C[small but probably sente. the big area on the board is the bottom right. you should be reducing white.]
