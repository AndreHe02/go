C[Hi gomaniac1,

W
played too nice in this game.  B made several reckless tenuki's in the
opening stage of the game, and W just followed B in playing elsewhere
without punishing him for the tenuki's. 

Also, at some point,
W should've taken a rough count.  W could not have afforded to allow
the game to proceeed peacefully at an even pace.  He should've tried to
complicate things by making some invasions, especially on the right
side, where B was very thin but was allowed several moves in a row to
turn that side into solid territory.

Finally, remember to take all the comments with a grain of salt.  I'm only 2k (IGS/KGS) 

Best,
Ken];B[qe];W[dq];B[dd];W[pq]C[Q4 is better.  See next note.]
;B[qo]C[Q5
might give B a better overall position because playing on the 4th line
would fit in well with D16 for B to aim to dominate the center,
especially after W played two stones low on the same 3rd line.]
;W[np]C[W
should consider a high pincer instead, either Q7 or Q8, to disrupt B's
intentions on the right side (B's R15 shows he's interested in building
up the right side.)]
(;B[lq]C[B is too hasty here.  He can afford to just pull back on the right side, I think.]

(;W[lp]C[i
don't know if this or n3 was better. i chose this one because i wanted
to cut off the escape to the middle, but i think i lost territory on it.
----

Neither
M4 nor N3 seems right.  Alternatively, W should probably consider
driving B out into the middle and aim for a bigger attack.]

(;B[cf]C[Interesting
choice.  It's not most efficient to use 4x4 stones for corner
enclosures alone.  B should've played either on the top, or, better,
D5.];W[od]C[i think that is the correct kakari.];B[pc];W[pd]
C[This is a very poor continuation for W.  W P17 is the proper move.]

(;B[co]C[Not
sure what B is aiming to do by tenuki in the upper right corner.  C5 is
of low value anyway, after B has played C14 on the low, 3rd line
already.  Here W should just take the upper right corner.]
(;W[do]C[W
just helps B to consolidate the left side with this move, with little
in return.  Again, M3 stone is not 100% dead and done yet.]
;B[dn];W[en]C[Risky.]
(;B[jc]C[Interesting strategy by B.]
(;W[qc]C[Taking the corner is too small here.  See var. of blocking on the other side.]
;B[dm]C[B got to play on both top and left sides!  W has been too nice.]
;W[em];B[dp];W[eo];B[cp];W[ep];B[dl];W[el]C[Pushing
from behind, when you are on the 5th line and the opponent on the 4th
line is generally too costly to be good.  And pushing from behind is
also just generally not a good idea.  Also, again, W has to realize
that M3 is not dead yet.  So, trading B a lot of territory on the side
with a W wall is not necessarily going to be profitable later.]
;B[cq];W[cr]C[W C2 is reckless.  Next, either B B2 or D2 or even E3 (helping out M3 perhaps?) is excellent follow-up.]
;B[qj]C[B
might be better to play 2-space extension at R8 instead.  He's clearly
ahead, and can win if he makes solid positions and doesn't leave any
weaknesses for W to exploit.];W[er]C[that whole battle i think i
lost out because i wanted to trap him into the corner while he got 2
major points.  i did make some thickness, though.
---------------

Not
sure what you mean by "trap into the corner".  B got not only half the
corner but a huge left side, too.  See above comments.

And losing sente at this point is painful.]
(;B[gc]C[B should play on the right side instead.  Or just come out with L4.]

(;W[mc]C[This
is too slow for W.  W is far behind and cannot afford to simply follow
B in grabbing up small slices of territory one after another.]
;B[cj]C[D9 is better.];W[hp];B[pl];W[jq]C[was that move neccesary?
---------

Probably.  But it then makes H4 unnecessary.

At
this point, W's more than 20 pts behind, even after K3.  W should've
tried to (1) muddy things up more by going for some invasions on either
left or right side or (2) try to build up a super moyo at bottom. 
Matching B at the same pace now simply isn't enough to win.

seems to know he is comfortably ahead and is thus content to just trade
territory with W.];W[hh]C[this battle i think came out to mutual
profit, so i think i did pretty well. on this last move, was that the
best spot, or should i have gone in deeper?];B[mp];W[mo];B[mq]

(;W[ko]C[O5 better.  B can hardly do much if he continues to put more stones to the left, in the middle of W's thick formation.]

this right, or should i have defende the cuts? i think that this gave
me more territory in the end, but he probably could have taken it apart

think that i read this wrong.  i thought blacks play there would cause
problems. i should have used it to place a stone at j8 or nearby.  it
would have prevented the invasion later on.];B[if];W[hg];B[qf]

A
3x3 invasion at this point, with B thickness all around, likely will
not work.  That is, B can just root out W by taking away the base, and
then W's have nowhere to run out to.];W[tt];B[bd];W[tt];B[hb]
