C[Ken : Hello teacher , please comment for my game with "GNU go" software. I choose white chess. Thanks


Hello,

I'll provide the comments.
This is funny because I also started Go with computers ....]

(;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf]C[Ken : is this ok , any better suggestion.

no, this is fine
There are other moves, of course, but this is the most current.]
;B[db]
(;W[pj]C[here you should finish the joseki (see variation)]
;B[dn];W[fp]C[ok];B[cp]
(;W[dj]C[again, there is a joseki here (see var)];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[ic];W[pf]C[good];B[nd];W[kp]MA[nq]C[you can go further, but your move is ok]
;B[qe];W[qf]CR[pg][ph][pi]LB[pf:1][qc:A][qf:2]C[this exchange favors white, because the shape is perfect :
you maybe have heard of the rule : extend 1 more space than the number of stones

Also, as you may see in many other games, white still has an invasion at A]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[ok];B[mq];W[lq];B[mp]
(;W[pm]LB[qn:A][qq:B]C[again, you can aim at A, or even invade the corner at B, because of the marked stone which will prevent Black from using its resulting wall (see variations)]
;B[oo]C[this is not very good. 
White can still invade the corner];W[cm]C[good, but beware of approaching too much.

this is an other rule : don't touch stones you attack.];B[qn]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[co]C[hmmm.

It may reveal costly to leave S7 open.
Black has already an enormous corner here ...

Unless you can kill the bottom left for sure.

I would play C5 later, but is locally it is a good move];B[cn]
;W[do];B[bm];W[bo]C[ok];B[bk];W[cl]TR[cm]MA[en][lc][rm]C[don't try to save the stone, because the more stones you add to it, the more it will cost if they die.

Rather sacrifice it and play bigger points on the board.]
(;B[bl]C[The variation shows what a stronger player (as black) would do once you defend your stones]
;W[ck]C[Ken : Is it ok ? Any other suggestion ?

no, fine since gnugo did not take the severest line.];B[bi]
;W[bj];B[aj];W[cj];B[bn];W[en]C[good];B[bg];W[ci];B[bh];W[cg]
;B[nf];W[pe]MA[oh][qc]C[no, you help black keep his corner]
;B[re];W[og]TR[oh]MA[re][rn]C[ok, some "advanced tactics" :

I said earlier thant it was better to defend at S7.

Now you may want to have me say that you should defend at S14 ...
But this time it is not true, because of an other proverb :
don't defend a skirt open on both sides ...

The thing is : the stones at S6 and S15 "overlap" their function.

So it is not necessary to defend here.

Nevertheless, P13 could be at P12 for better shape];B[rf];W[rg]
;B[ln];W[pn]MA[jn][lc][mh]C[useless.

This stone does nothing in terms of attacking or making territorry.

You have plenty of bigger ponts on the board]
(;B[rm]C[oh, this is bad !

This should be at T9, and cost you 15 points (see variation)]
;W[rl];B[qo]C[B loses a move here];W[dc];B[jn]C[interesting move by black (it is an important point, for both players)]
;W[cb];B[hn];W[ho];B[io];W[hp];B[sg];W[sh]
(;B[gf]C[strange : gnugo usually does not miss the variation ...]
;W[sf];B[rc];W[eb];B[lg];W[ng];B[ip];W[iq];B[jq];W[ir]
(;B[jr]TR[kp][lq]MA[hn][jn]C[eh ... it accomplished what I predicted earlier, but from the other side ....

Unfortunately, it does not work !

it happens that the white stones can live ...];W[jp]C[by cutting, the black sones are deprived of their liberties.

I don't know if you actually "read" this, but this is difficult "life and death" problem :-)]
;B[is]C[useless];W[hq];B[js];W[jo]
(;B[in]C[better variation for black];W[hs]
(;B[gh]C[gnugo has seen its stones are lost (see variation)]
;W[gj];B[hk];W[ij];B[ih];W[hj];B[sl];W[sk];B[oe]C[again !];W[rd]
C[?];B[sd];W[kn];B[km];W[ko];B[ml];W[nl];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[kq]
;B[sm];W[qk];B[nm];W[om];B[gl];W[gk];B[nj];W[nk];B[mj];W[mk]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[ik];W[jj]MA[bf][gb]LB[ji:B][jk:C][ki:D][kj:A]
C[Ken : Is "A" or "B" better than this move. I think now is too conservative.

in order :

D, C, B, A, the move in the game
D is better, because it threats a move at M12, capturing the 2 black stones

This is locally.

you have better moves elsewhere];B[mh];W[nh]MA[mg]C[don't play "empty triangles"]
;B[lo];W[ks];B[mr];W[qq]C[Ken : Is there any steps to get the corner . I failed after the trail.

not at this stage, with all the black stones around.

This can be done (usually) only in the early stages of the game, where you have no black stone in the immediate vicinity of the Q4 stone]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[pq];W[qp];B[ro]CR[qn][qo][rm][rn][sl][sm]MA[po]
C[Ken : I should cut at "X" and kill the marked chess .

one say "stone", not "chess" :-)



yes ! it works.

But this version of gnugo must be fairly old, or be set to a weak level, because it normally would play at Q5 instead of S5, which is a big blunder.]

;B[lh];W[ji];B[fn];W[an]CR[aj][bg][bh][bi][bk][bl][bm][bn][cn]
[dn]C[Ken : Is the necessary to place any chess in order to kill the marked stones , or they are already dead , since I didn't any response from the openent .

Before B14, they were alive, but now they are dead.

You should explore it];B[of];W[am];B[fh];W[pk]C[no necessary before B has played H11]
;B[gg];W[di];B[hf];W[ag]C[Ken : this is not necessary . excess move.

yes];B[hi];W[im]C[??];B[tt];W[ak];B[tt];W[so];B[tt];W[rq];B[tt]
;W[ss]C[Ken : I have one question , if I put chess into oponent area , even if they will be certainly dead in future , but it will reduce their point ( Japanese counting method ) , cos oponent need to add stone to response , like I am doing now , am I correct ?

no, this is wrong, because you are adding stones as well., and they will count as prisonners.

So the result remains equal];B[tt];W[ps];B[tt];W[or];B[tt];W[np]
;B[nq]C[Ken : add black stone will reduce the "point" , correct ?

no, as stated before];W[oq];B[op]C[Any comment of the whole game ?
I don't have any "kyu" , do you think 30 kyu is appropiate for my skill , since I must mark KYU in the request form.
Thanks .



Let's start by the end :

judging from you play, you would be largely stronger than 30k
However, it is fairly impossible to provide a fair ranking, but I think you may claim 25 to 20 kyu.

The only way to know is to confront to other players, and that is one of the advces I would like to provide.

There is not much more to say about the game itself, because you are playing against a computer, and they suffer from some lacks.
Obviously, your style is trained against the computer, which grants some results.
However, if you came to play against more "agressive" players, you may encounter some difficulties.

Therefore, I cannot give good advices regarding the playing itself (apart from getting some very basic josekis, just the first 5 or 6 moves of 2 or 3 main josekis).

The rest will come from playing, either at your local club, or on internet servers.

One last thing : it is usually very profitable to do a self review of your game *before* sending it to a reviewer.

Hope this helps.
