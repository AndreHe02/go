;B[pi];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[cq]TR[ho]C[Maybe a little early to jump into the corner.  You could have put some pressure on the H3 stone instead, maybe with a move at H5]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[kq];B[di]C[Splitting attack.  These are more common on the 3rd line, as it's easier to establish a base.  Still a good move.]
;W[dg];B[dl]C[Your stones don't really have a base with this move, it might be better one line lower at C3.]

C[Slow.  Both of your groups in the bottom left are fairly strong, so there's no need to try to connect them at this point.  Bigger points are around K16 and O17]

(;B[kb]C[You don't usually want to give your opponent a ponnuki (shape formed from capturing 1 stone) so easily.  Letting him capture the L16 stone may have been unavoidable, but in this case you forced him to capture and didn't really gain any benefit (the L18 stone isn't doing you much good).  

It would've been better to extend to O16 so that you could connect to your upper right group.  This would have the added benefit of pressuring his upper right corner group, which is starting to look a bit vulnerable.]
