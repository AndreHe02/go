C[I've been playing a lot better recently (10 wins in a row) but I was clearly outplayed here.  Even if I had not lost the big group I was over 20 points behind.

 lakeland 11k*: Hi

Hi lakeland!

I'm Michael (Schnoffos[6k\]@IGS). I'm not sure wether I'm strong enough for my advice beeing
useful to you, but I'll try my best ;-)];B[dp];W[pd]C[
 Jungko 12k*: Hi];B[qp];W[dd]C[
 Jungko 12k*: I see you can win all player.];B[kq]C[
 lakeland 11k*: heheh, yes, yesterday was good];W[jd];B[qf]
;W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[cn]C[
 Jungko 12k*: oh i know...];B[co]C[I thought C5 was supposed to be bad here, but I wasn't sure if I should respond C9, D5 or F3.  I decided D6 was the simpliest.

S: I'm not sure if c5 is bad, at least it's good if B has a stone around d10. If the continuation is wD6,
bF4, wC/D10, then white has the advantage to dive into b's corner at c3 later. You'll know about that.

In this case (no b stone at d10) black has no compensation for wc3, so this is at least suboptimal
for b.];W[dn];B[ci]C[Again, I'm not sure, but I feel like bC11 is not good.]

(;W[fp]C[S: I think you played along the "enemies key point is your own".

I would have probably played c9, see the variation for what I expect would happen thereafter.

Do you like this result better?];B[cq];W[ep]C[I felt my shape was too weak, but because this was gote I think it was bad.

I think still C9 is good to settle your shape. Maybe also C14.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[hc];W[ck]C[I was worried about the split round D5 and wanted to assure life if it was going to split

S: Then you should have played E4 f.g. at E5?

In general, it's a good idea to finish a shape before playing elsewhere. If you want to play
elsewhere instead, make sure you get out in sente and then finish your shape. Are you sure
you can do it? No? Then don't.  Do you think that playing tenuki and then selecting a sequence
which ensures you a sente (or equivalent adantage) and then ending up in gote to fix your
shape is after all an advantage?

For me it's very hard to decide how I can get out a sequence in sente, so I try not to play moves
which leave groups in a weak state.];B[eq];W[hd]C[I expected b to live here but hoped to gain good influence]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[ec];B[jc];W[kc];B[id]
(;W[jb]C[S: This is a mistake (I believe).

If you first block at j15, you probably get a ko for the live of the black group.

Please take a look at the variations, and tell me if I'm wrong. (that last variation is the ko).

(Again you have to verify, I'm not absolutely sure if i'm right)]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[kd];W[je];B[kb];W[lc];B[ja];W[lb];B[ib]C[I'm quite happy with that.  I wasn't sure about M18 (nice ko threat) but I wanted to avoid playing M15 quite yet so decided I needed it for the liberties]
;W[iq]C[S: I think there are better points to play.

black is happy to play o4, since it both stakes out a moyo at the right and prospects for territorry on the lower side. You on the other side, did not make territory between f4 and j3. Your shape at e4d6 is still not really strong.If you dont like to play p3/4 then how about e10?

I think somewhere at p4 is urgent now.];B[np];W[qm]C[S: Well you had to do something there.  You are behind now, as your stones at the lower left are inefficient and do not accomplish much. To put them to use, you have to attack the b formation at the upper left, but I don't know how to do this efficeintly myself. I'ld be interested what a stronger player
would say to this position here.];B[qk]C[I wasn't sure about R7, I was told to not have too many weak groups and I consider E4 weak, but at the same time I think B would be too far ahead after R7

S: You're right. But R7 asks black to make his r15 group save (it is now). While attacking your stone at R7 black will secure his lower right territory (probably) and this is also enough to win the game.

Hard to say what to do here.

In the next variation some ideas, but none of them is thought out. Maybe you can profit from this "brainstorming". I'ld be glad about comments...]

(;W[om];B[pn]C[
 lakeland 11k*: you are winning

S: I sometimes play moves like this, but they are probably not good. At least I nearly never see them played in dan games.]
;W[pm]C[
 Jungko 12k*: Why?];B[ko]C[
 Jungko 12k*: Why do you think that?
 lakeland 11k*: more settled, and equal moyo];W[io]C[
 Jungko 12k*: oh..];B[fq];W[gp];B[ef];W[bo]C[
 Jungko 12k*: you are 11k real

S: It's not yet time to fight for 3 points, i'ld say];B[do]

(;W[bc]C[I'm starting to get a little desperate

This move would have had an effect before E14 has been played. Now it doesn't thread b much.]
;B[eo]C[so black ignores you and destroys the influence you had before.]
;W[bj]C[
 Jungko 12k*: E5 is big than B 18...I think];B[bi]C[
 lakeland 11k*: yeah, I wanted to get sente but you ignored it :-)]
;W[bp]C[
 Jungko 12k*: yes :-)];B[bq];W[jm];B[jn];W[in];B[km]C[I considered sacrificing the three stones, but they represent 1/4 of the board so I decided I couldn't.  I"m looking greedily at the top though

S: Well, after b cut you to pieces, he may easyly invade the bottom left anytime. playing along the j-line only weakens you 3 stones, but you do not get anything good yourself. Should not be played]

;B[nl]
(;W[ol]C[now it is clearly ko for life.  I don't want to play the cut now because I suspect it will kill M11 and that will lose everything for me on the top]

 lakeland 11k*: yes, the best I could see
 Jungko 12k*: i don't like it...:-(
 Jungko 12k*: oh...no...];W[lp];B[kp];W[nk];B[jj]C[Since I didn't have enough ko threats to win the ko I think I should have sacrificed here.  I know dan players keep ko fights going for a long time but I didn't think I could afford to lose]

 Jungko 12k*: i make ko...]
(;W[kh];B[mf]C[
 lakeland 11k*: not even ko
 lakeland 11k*: you kill if I capture
 Jungko 12k*: :-) Oh..

S: Well this was expensive :-) Better give away 3 stones at q14, if it got that far]

 lakeland 11k*: well, I live, but...];B[ig]C[
 lakeland 11k*: hmmm, nice

 lakeland 11k*: but I've lost all my territory
 Jungko 12k*: oh...you are good... i know...
 Jungko 12k*: Catkun tell me you stronger.than he...

S: Now again, you not only lost group@k12, but also 2 stones@h12]

S: Too late to fight, now, with this move they are already dead.]

S: Well after all it's clear that what happened N15 is absolutely fatal to a game, so that's for
about 50 points I guess?

I think the first loosing move was to let black O4.

You will not gain much from my comment, I guess. Maybe you ask a stronger player for additional hints.]
