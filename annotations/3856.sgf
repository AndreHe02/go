Sirkut> Thank you for submitting this game for review.  I hope you find my comments helpful.  Here are three keys to keep in mind while reading this review:
- Don't touch your opponents stones unless necessary
- Play away from your opponents strength
- Be more aggressive];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[oc];W[jd];B[nq]
;W[fc];B[pj];W[qh];B[qj];W[pm]
(;B[ph]TR[pg]C[Sirkut> Try to be as indirect as possible with your moves by making them serve more than one purpose.
Touching white gives him something to push against and will make him stronger.  I like the marked positions better.  See variation.]

Sirkut> I believe where you played would have turned out even better if white had played P13.  I've added to your variation.]

;B[fq];W[od];B[jp]TR[iq]C[Sirkut> Here the marked position would have been better because it establishes a stronger connection to the stone at F3.]
;W[lq];B[mo]TR[jq]C[Sirkut> This is an example of a response that is not aggressive enough.  You know white is going to fight for the life of that stone because he's been a big fighter so far.  So you have the option of letting him fight into the center (which you may not be able to stop anyway) or fight for life under you.  Since it's easier to get points along the edge, K3 would have bought you more.]

(;B[mm]CR[rl][pm][kn][ko][qo][ro][kp][jq][lq][jr]TR[jk]C[Sirkut> Both of the marked white groups are weak.  You could use a large net to put pressure on both of them.  This is an example of how you can effectively attack by being very indirect.  See the variation.]

;W[lr];B[js];W[ks];B[lp];W[jm];B[ql]TR[cf][cj]C[Sirkut> It's good that you're pressuring white's group, but it's a bit early.  I would focus more at getting more potential territory for yourself before starting to chip away at white.]

C[Sirkut> Nice invasion.];W[cj];B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[dn]
(;B[co]C[Sirkut> Here you force white to take one of your liberties.  A 3 stone group like this is weak.  As you find out, you can't afford to just leave it that way.  It was a great idea though.  See the variations for other ways to take care of it.]
;W[cp];B[ch]C[Sirkut> Nice extension, though it leaves your three stones stranded.]
;W[cl];B[dj];W[dk];B[di];W[fe];B[cb];W[db];B[kc];W[jc];B[jb]
TR[lc]SQ[nf][lh][ki]C[Sirkut> I think this was a mistake.  You don't have much room to make life by pushing under.  You do however have a strong group that you can connect to.  M17 would give you a base to push from.  This is a great way to use your influence and give you plenty of options to work with in the end game.]

;W[ck];B[lj]CR[bj][bk]SQ[bi]C[Sirkut> Great idea, but again you needed one more stone.  The marked stones that you just put down are in trouble if white plays B11.  The move you played instead was not urgent because either way you push white (or whichever way white moves on his own) the results are about the same.]
;W[kj];B[li];W[fm];B[fj];W[hm];B[gn]C[i think i'm losing most of my games at the end
what do you think considerring this game?
thank you

Sirkut> I think you actually did quite well in the end game and actually ended up reducing white's moyo in the center quite a bit considering white's large wall of influence at the top of the board.  Other than that, the end game is all about keeping sente and playing the largest move before your opponent; First gaining a point or two here or there, then reducing your opponents territory a point at a time...]
;W[gm];B[hn];W[in];B[io];W[im];B[cf]TR[df][fg]C[Sirkut> The marked positions would have given you a few more points.]
;W[ef];B[jh];W[if];B[lf];W[me];B[hj];W[ik]
(;B[eg]TR[fg]C[Sirkut> Again, you would have had an easier time turning the center moyo into territory by not touching white's stones.  See variation.]

;W[lk]SQ[ho]C[Sirkut> Another key mistake of white's.  Fortunately you saw it before he did! :)]
;B[ho];W[mh];B[mi];W[og];B[se]TR[sd][sf]C[Sirkut> Here you could improve by a few points by playing T14 or T16 instead because they let you keep sente.  Keeping sente is key in end game because whoever has it can walk along taking all the end-game points.]

a) Influencing your opponents position as much as he influences yours
b) Claiming large strokes of territory before completely resolving fights over smaller ones
c) Attacking more indirectly and with moves that serve more than one purpose
I hope you found my advice clear and the suggested tactics helpful.  If you have any questions feel free to contact.  Good luck and have fun!]

The difference is that because black didn't start out by touching white, white isn't nearly as strong in the center so there are still options open.]

C[Sirkut> The point of this example is that white had two weak groups sandwhiched between 3 strong groups of yours.  Use that strength then to make white scramble.  Chances are at least one of the groups will live or escape, but while white is trying to decide which one to save you can make sure that you get something no matter which he chooses because you're in control.]
