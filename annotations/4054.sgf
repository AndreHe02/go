C[RW> Hi there I am your reviewer, my name is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS and IGS. I will review for white. My comments start with RW>

RW> In this game, white has been playing for one month. He played very well, apart from overlooking one big move (N11) that black did not see either. 

RW> For white to increase his current level of 25k to 20k, he needs to understand and implement in his play three main issues. In this game i expressed them as go proverbs.

#1 : there is no territory in the center
#2 : touch your opponent and you make him stronger
#3 : defend before attack];B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dq];B[fc];W[db]
;B[fe];W[eg]C[I played this move so that black would not simply run me down the board--was there a better course of action?

RW> White "pushes" black and that means taking charge of the game. This is good. The downside of this move is that the move is on the fifth line (the E-line). As a rule of thumb, you should never play outside lines 2,3 and 4 during openings of the game (first 25+ moves). This rule of thumb follows from proverb #1 -- there is no territory in the center

RW> Later on in the game, black will be unable to create life at the left upper side of the board, because he has no "roots", no firm grip on the side or corner. And without roots any tree will fall down easily.]
;B[fp];W[do];B[gg]C[RW> this is move 11 for black. White will capture this stone at move 32. Hence you see that this move is obsolete (too far from either side of the board) and should not be played at this moment of the game.]
;W[fm]C[RW> this is too far away from the side of the board. Black can easily infiltrate behind enemy lines and then white is rootless, that is to say, white misses base contact with the side or corner of the board. 

RW> this move does less harm than black's last move, simply because there are more white stones on the left side already. The distance between white F7 and E13 is much less than the distance between black G13 and R16.]
;B[gn];W[gm]C[RW> as a rule of thumb, you should avoid to touch the opponent stone during the opening. When you touch the opponent stone, both you and the opponent are affected (proverb#2). Instead, seek the free space. 

RW> H4 would be a great move for white];B[hn];W[im]C[This move allowed a damaging cut.

RW> just this simple rule... that you do not move beyond the 4th (in some cases 5th) line (proverb#1). J7 is 9th line from the left and 7th from the bottom. 

RW> Fact is that black pushes (= hunter's view) against white and makes terrritory (= farmer's view) at the bottom of the board. Note that these two views always go together. You will drastically improve your kyu (from 25k to 20k) ranking when you learn to apply both views hunter AND farmer at the same time. Which means that you achieve multiple goals with one move. If you can't , then farmer before hunter, or defense before attack (proverb#3)

RW> Choose an area where the territory is not yet claimed by any player. What if you played L16 here?]
;B[hm]C[RW> in the next 30 moves or so, white will try to save this J7 stone. By focussing on saving this misplaced stone, white tends to loose sight of what is really important. Best is to admit loss of one stone, here and now, and get on with the game. (proverb#1)]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[gl];B[il];W[hi];B[jj];W[gh];B[ih];W[hg];B[hf]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[gf];B[ge];W[fg];B[if];W[ig];B[jg];W[ed];B[fd]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[ik];B[jk];W[fo];B[gp];W[io]C[This was my thought of how to make life on the other side of black's wall, but I have a feeling I should have attacked sooner--black has a lot of influence in this part of the board now.

RW> you can make life, you can make territory, you can attack, you can defend. In go, doing multiple things with the same one move, is the way to win. The goal of Go is to minimize the number of moves you need to "win" the game. And the game is a dialogue between your opponent (what does he want?) and you (what do you want?). The player that takes responsibility for both is the player who is entitled to win. You will notice this as soon as you are ready to see from the opponent's view.

RW> Go is like dancing with your partner. When you start out on 30kyu, you're not looking after your partner. Your feet , the music, the other people on the dance floor, your partner's feet, these are all overwhelming in their demand for attention. There is no other way. This is how we learn.

RW> i came to think that you mention a black wall. When you look back into the game, you will notice that you "saw" this wall long before it was erected. In fact, by fearing the emerging wall, you effectively help to create it. Think about this... then you will see that what is really needed is to leave the fear of loss and enter the fun of playing.]
;B[ip];W[go];B[ho];W[in];B[jl];W[jp]C[I thought that black had a potential net, but I think I could have played directly at L6.

RW> yes, the J5 group is dead for the moment. Go back to the point where you wanted to create life. Did it succeed? What happened to black's territory while you were creating life? Did black profit in any way?

These are important questions to ponder upon. Answering these questions is totally irrelevant; what matters is that you use these questions as a tool.

There's a difference in dancing between making the right moves and the actual dancing. When you use the questions as a tool, in effect you pay attention to your dancing partner. You view the game from your opponents perspective AS WELL AS from your own perspective. 

It is said that in go, the best move to do is often the move that your opponent would have done if it were his/her turn. So just walk the path from I to WE to US. Focus on having fun, because having fun is learning.]
;B[iq];W[kn];B[kr];W[mn];B[om];W[qm]C[Was this a good way to attack?  It seemed that black had left plenty of space to be cut.

RW> Yes the right side is still wide open. Black has not touched base anywhere on the right side of the board. You are free to start the dialogue there about "who owns this place?"

RW> Watch the left side of the board, the same goes for white, especially around  the C10 area]
;B[pn];W[pl];B[qq];W[no]C[RW> This move O5 is on the fifth line twice (O and 5). That is really hard work to touch base from there. Yes you can make life with this move. But it takes many moves... while at the same time there are so many other places on lines 4, 3 and 2 (Q, R and S) where you can place stones without black interfering, and gain equal or more amount of territory. (proverb #1)]
;B[nq];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[mk];B[nj];W[oo];B[po];W[oj]
;B[ni];W[nc]C[Was this sensible?

RW> sensible no, but it is a brilliant move !  It shows you play with your heart - that is wonderful. 

RW> If your opponent were a computer, then it would probably be a bad move. The J5 group is still not alive, black might just strangle the emerging P10 group with P11, or black might just allow white to create a minimal living group O17 while black creates a much larger territory for himself.

RW> In this case however, your opponent will be touched by the "brutality" of your move. I could not imagine how an opponent would not be affected by a move like this. And therefore you have his attention.]
;B[oc];W[od];B[pc];W[qg]C[RW> this is a GREAT move. now you are connecting the dots.]
;B[oi]C[RW> black is great at countering the emerging white wall]
;W[pi]C[After 77, I felt that life for this group was unlikely--would I have done much better by blocking the cut at Q9?

RW> I think Q11 much better than Q9.];B[pk];W[pj];B[qk];W[qe]
;B[rd];W[pe];B[rf];W[qf];B[rg];W[rh];B[re];W[ob];B[pb];W[oa]
;B[pa];W[sg]C[This was a mistake--93 was sente, yes?

RW> just remember this : that there are very few occasions where it makes sense to play 1st line.

RW> white wants to save P19 group and black threatens with O18 move to kill the P19 group. Therefore white T13 was a mistake - i can see that. 

RW> By white playing P19 and the triggered black response of Q19, the white P19 group is dead. I dont know if this situation is sente / for who the sente is.]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[na];W[md]C[Protecting some cuts.

RW> very good.];B[sf];W[sh];B[qh]C[I had read that I could protect this cut, but black O13 surprised me.  I am not sure I understand all of the threats that took place, or whether either of us could have played better.

RW> again, not playing T12 (first line move) but instead on the exact position where black plays now (R12) keeps you out of trouble.]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[oh];B[ng];W[pg]C[RW> very good move !];B[og]
;W[nh]C[Poking through to deprive black of territory, but leaving less space for white to develop there.  I think that this move was poor, but I am unsure. (it may not be important)

RW> have no doubt, you did the right thing :-)];B[mh];W[ph]
;B[mg];W[lf]C[RW> white N11 kills black O11 group. This is the overlooked move during the rest of the game. I might add : overlooked by both players.]
;B[lg];W[je];B[jd];W[jf];B[ie];W[id]C[I could tell that this was going to be a serious fight--I played mostly by instinct in this area.

RW> wonderful move. double attack on black J15 group AND black K16 group.]
;B[he];W[kg];B[jh];W[ic];B[ke];W[kf]C[.This group seemed weak to me throughout the game.  Could black have taken it at some point?  It would have totally changed the outcome of this corner.

RW> white N11 still wide open. With the capture of black O11 group, white could bring the dead N6 group back to life and white wins.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[le];W[kd]C[RW> great move. double attack again (K17 group AND L15 group both under attack by one single white move)]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[me];W[mf]C[I had to think for a bit to make sure that black could not escape after this move.

RW> yes both groups are dead (K17 and L15)];B[ql]C[Was this move necessary for black?

RW> yes. if white gets to play R8 first then black group R9 is dead.

RW> however, black N11 much more urgent.];W[fr]C[This point appeared to me to be the largest territory grab I could make.  Did it belong elsewhere?

RW> you should first play E4 and seal off black. (proverb #3 - defense before attack). Not defending will hurt white bad in the next part of the game.]
;B[gr];W[fq]C[RW> E4 is required here.];B[fn]C[Trouble is stirring.  I am still learning how to contain these situations once they get out of control.

RW> look at comment on previous move. advice is  to look after defence before attacking (proverb #3)]
;W[eo]C[RW> to prevent the black invasion that starts after this move, you need to give up on the F5 group and stay a little further away from black. 

RW> Best move i think is D6];B[en];W[dn];B[em];W[el];B[dm];W[cn]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[ek];W[dj];B[fl];W[gk]
;B[bk];W[fj];B[bj];W[bh]C[RW> this move is the best. here you do not touch black, and that gives you the space that you need to stop the invasion. (proverb #2)]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[ah];W[bg];B[ai];W[ag]C[In the end I seal off the invasion, but I've lost a lot of territory, and the fact I am still alive at all seems more coincidence than intention.

RW> you played this sequence very well. the bottom left corner is now yours. playing E4 (and later D6) was the proper way to effectively prevent the invasion in the first place. So the lesson here is to prioritize : defense first, attack second. (proverb #3)]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[am];W[an];B[al]C[Both this move and 171 seemed completely unnecessary to me.

RW> yes this is true];W[ej];B[ak];W[fk];B[el];W[hb]C[More fighting.]
;B[hc];W[ga];B[gc];W[ec]C[I think that this is where I decided that I could probably kill black's large group here, knowing that my group to its right could not be taken.

RW> black O15 could be a major problem for white. See var on the next move]

(;B[ef];W[df];B[de];W[ff];B[ee];W[ce];B[cf]C[Black's unreasonable(?) invasion.

RW> black does not see that his group is dead. so it makes sense to me that he keeps on fighting.]
;W[dg];B[cd];W[be];B[hh]C[Black forces a connect.];W[gg];B[kh]
C[Black forces me to take his group.. aren't these very small moves?

RW> this one is urgent, as is N11.];W[ne];B[ma]C[RW> black still does not see the N11 threat.]
;W[lb];B[kb]C[Black still thinks that this group is alive.]
;W[la];B[oa];W[pd];B[ep];W[dp]C[I try to play out this corner the best I can.

RW> this is the right move for white];B[gq];W[eq];B[fs];W[es]
;B[gs];W[er];B[jq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[lq]
;B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[kk]C[I decide that I'm making life in the center.

RW> N11 still possible and kill black O11 group.];B[lk];W[lj]
;B[ll]C[I am under the impression that I have captured black at this point.

RW> more chances with M8. Best is N11 still possible.];W[kl]
;B[ml]C[This double atari takes me off guard.];W[nm];B[mj];W[kj]
C[Futile.];B[km];W[jm];B[lm];W[li]C[Also futile.];B[lh];W[ln]
C[I misread the capturing race.];B[ki]
(;W[mm]C[RW> here you can play a sente move (P6) before playing N7. If black does not respond then you capture the black P7 group. See var.]
;B[mi];W[kp]C[RW> same here : first P6 = sente move];B[jo]C[I think of bent fours and fail to see that this is an atari. Since I only get one eye out of this space, this is a stupid move and should be at K6.]
;W[ko];B[jn];W[on]C[White makes life.

RW> yes that was close.];B[pm];W[rj]C[RW> good move !];B[rk]
;W[sj];B[qj];W[ri];B[sk];W[of];B[ij]C[The four-minute gap is due to distraction, not overthinking.]
;W[hj];B[hd]C[I wondered if there was any conceivable reason that black would play this.

RW> yes. if you overlook J18 then black can escape. In the heat of the game this sometimes happens. See the N11 example in this game.]
;W[gd];B[ja]C[This move further demonstrated to me that black still felt the corner was rightly his.]

RW> All in all , great play , two rules only and then you can be 20k. One is to stick to the lines 2,3 and 4 for as long as possible. Two is to defend before attack. The rest is cosmetic ... just forget about it. Enjoy !
