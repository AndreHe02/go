C[This is a game played recently on the Dragon Go Server.  Both white and black enjoyed the game, mainly because we talked about it through the whole game.  The endgame was played out so both players could get some more experience in that aspect of the game.

The game is being submitted by black, with a few questions that white had after reviewing the game.

We wish to thank the reviewer, we appreciate the oppurtunity to learn.

Hello, I'm Tom, and I'm reviewing your game.  In general, focus on the oppening, and on consiously building space for your self while taking it away from the opponent.  Many moves from both players seemed too nice.  I hope my comments are helpful.  if you have any questons, feel free to email me.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do]C[Black:
  Opening thoughts are very tough for me.  Was this the appropriate corner to approach?

This seems fine to me.];W[fp]
(;B[ck]C[these opening moves seem passive for black. See variation.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn]C[Black:
   Here I realized C9 was a mistake in response to F4 because my stones were too close together.  I have since looked up the joseki moves starting with the knights move.  My question is would the standard responses work with the way the whole board was configured?  My guess is yes, because of the limited amount of stones on the board.

Yes, the variations I showed are pretty standard and appropriate for this situation.]
;W[jd]SQ[cf][qf]C[maybe slow.  As White I'd approach at C14 or R14.]
;B[qn];W[np]
(;B[pj]C[I prefer s4 here, although that may be a personal preference.  See variation.]
;W[fc]
(;B[df]C[I think F16 works better with the influence of black's left side group see variation.]

(;W[cc]C[white questions involving this local situation:

1. is c17 (move 18) ok? What is the best sequence for both?

This seems ok, but I think d18 is maybe a little more solid.  Your group on top is tenuous right now, so you want to support it.  See variation.  An invasion like this is best if you have a pinser stone on the left side.

1.1 Because white eventually invaded the corner, f17 (move 16) looks like a redundant move later; should f17 just have played c17, invading the corner straight away?

Sometimes there is still aji in the F17 stone after an invasion, so it isn't always a waste.  However, the best way to keep it from being wasteful is probably not to invade.  Save 3-3 invasions for situations where an approach seems too dangerous.

1.2 For black's move 17, is d14, c14, or other, better in this case? If black had played c14, white would probably not play c17. Is bc14-wf15 for moves 17-18 acceptable to both?

Black should either play D17 or C16.  The advantage to D17 is it threatens the F17 and K16 stones, whereas C16 does a better job of building territory on the left.  I think either is ok, but I'd probably play D17 to stay aggressive.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[eb]
(;W[cb];B[ec];W[be]LB[fd:A][bf:B]C[A and B are good options for black.]

(;B[cd]C[White:
1.3 For move 25, could black play b14 to enclose white and make thick walls both at the top and left, making the white corner invasion bad, or is it not possible? If possible, what are the alternatives for white c17 if white were to avoid that corner enclosure? o17, d18, f15?

Yes, black can play b14.  The only other option for white is to play B18 instead of C18, I've put up a variation for that also.]
;W[bd];B[lc];W[ge]C[A move around L17 or M16 is probably better.  Look for opportunities to attach; it often gives shape in tight spaces.]

(;B[dh]LB[hc:A][rp:C][jq:B]C[black:
  Looking at the game now I feel this move was too conservative.  But I am not sure about alternatives.

a,b and c are good options.  In general, always look for attacks.]
;W[rd]SQ[kc]C[white:
2. (move 30) Is white's invading the right at s16 appropiate now, or is it better to strengthen the center group first? It seems, black l15, for example, might put the center white group in defensive. But the upper right also looked attractive. Which is better? Is center really in danger? How should white invade the top right area?

White does not control the bottom middle yet.  But this invasion is pretty strong, and turns out well.
I'd say the most important move for white is L17.];B[jp]SQ[jq]
C[black:
   I felt if white played here I'd be in real trouble.  However, this stone looks very lonely down there by itself.  Was there a better way to aim a stone into this area with more support?

should have been lower];W[iq]
(;B[jn]C[bad move.  See variations.]
(;W[ko]C[bad move.  Play L3 to cut off base.];B[jo];W[ql]C[white:
3. (move 36) white r8: what should be done here? white wanted to defend the corner, but wr3 looked too soft and giving black p6 or s4; wr5 was not fully secure and give black q6 good shape; r4 was also not secure(?). Therefore, wr8 was intended to start some activities and play accordingly.

S4 is a nice way to secure the corner in sente, because then black has to protect against the R8 invastion.  L3, R17, and L17 are all also big moves for white.

black:
   Even though black was fairly stable/secure after this fight I felt white gained much more.  Were there better responses?

Black's best response here is probabply q7.]
(;B[pl]SQ[pm];W[pm];B[qm];W[pk];B[ol];W[qj];B[ok];W[qk];B[on]
;W[qh];B[qc]C[black:
   This looks way too conservative now.  Perhaps playing at white's next choice (r14) would be more interesting?

This is probably the best you can do here.];W[qf];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[le];B[hc];W[ie];B[jc]C[black:
   I felt black gained more than it should here.  Could white have stopped the territory gain by playing atari at h17 and forcing black to capture?

Yes.];W[qo];B[oo];W[op];B[kq]C[black:
  This was simply the wrong move.  I see moves now that I find more interesting.
Whites next choice (g6), or a line lower at g5.  Maybe getting out to the center in the top with g13.  Are the other choices better, out of those 3 which feels best?  Also, are there other plays black should consider?

The floating black stones need to either connect or make eyes to be of use.  I think a move around M7 might be your best bet.  White should have tried harder to kill these stones.]
;W[gn]C[4. (move 60) black is building up some moyo, so white g6 was to prevent it, but white's lower right corner still look somewhat insecure? Is it better or necessary to play an extra move at lower right? If so, where is best? And can black do anything as it is now?

Black can play n3, and take a little territory, but an invasion around R3 would probably fail.]
;B[fm];W[hh];B[md]SQ[bg][kk][bn][mq]C[black:
  Again, now this feels conservative

N3, L9, B6 or B13 are all solid choices.];W[mq];B[kn];W[fi]
;B[ei]C[black:
   The stone at L6 was placed there to aid an extension to the center (either K9 or L9), should white G11 have been ignored to play that area first?

No, this is ok, there aren't too many points in the center.

Frome here, white pretty much has the game under control.  These are the end of my comments.]
