C[Thanks for reviewing this game. My general questions are:

I often don't know what is the best move -- in the opening and in the middle game.

I
have weakness toward the end of the opening and at the beginning of the
middle game -- I don't know how expand or develop my territories. I
find myself constantly fighting to keep my own space, while the
opponent has happily secured a large chunk of territory by the start of
the middle game.

Thanks.

Ed];B[pp]C[Ed:

My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game for you.  My comments should be prefaced with "Ted:"

I believe the reason you lost is because you didn't attack White in the upper left of the board.  Also, I think you should look more for points to cut your opponent.  You missed a big one toward the end of the game.

Hi, I am Javier Mugica and I will review your review the best I can. I will used my nickname of HARTZ. I will comment mostly your commentaries and the main game when I think you overlooked something really important.]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[fc];W[db];B[ic]C[I
 thought this was necessary; otherwise White could play at H17 and
pincer my F17 stone.

Ted:  Extending from the F17 stone is generally the continuation in situations like this.  White does have a threat at G19, but right now that's really too small for either player to worry about.

HARTZ: you are right, but a interesting posibility here is to make and approach at the other side, at c14. F17 stone is quite strong because it can extend or jump into the center.]
;W[fd];B[gd]MA[ep]C[Is this necessary?  Is it better to develop elsewhere, like E4?

Ted: I think maybe you should have played at G17 here.  If you don't respond to White's move at F16, you have to worry that White will play at G17 next.  In any case, a response here is necessary.

HARTZ: the g16 is a natural move here and it is quite good. Another possibility is to exploit white weaknesses playing at e17.]
;W[fe];B[ep];W[fb];B[gc];W[ec];B[dq]C[I am told the corner is important, so I head toward it.

Ted:  Well, yes, the corner is important.  But right now, I think you don't need to play a second stone here.  If White plays some sort of extension from the C4 stone next, the corner will develop like some sort of standard joseki.  And joseki are "standard" for a reason -- they generally give roughly equal results to both sides.  After all, professionals wouldn't knowingly play sequences that give them inferior positions!  :-)

I'd look at playing Q10 instead of D3.

HARTZ: It is a good idea to try to attack white corner while reinforcing black e4 stone but d3 is not the proper move for that. Much better are c3 or c5. C10 is very big also.]
;W[cq];B[cr]MA[hp][jp]C[I think I was too concerned about grabbing a piece of the corner.  Probably H4 or K4 is better?

Ted: C2 is premature.  H4 looks like a good idea.  If you play at K4, you'll have to worry about White attacking later on with a move like H4 himself.  This also gives up sente.

HARTZ: C2 is a end game move and thus not urgent. Also gote so less interesting. The usual idea here is to make a big extension at k4 or k3. If white invade later he will have a hard time for living.]
;W[br];B[dr];W[hq]C[I didn't like that he was able to play here.

Ted: When you played at C2, you gave up sente!  That's one of the reasons why C2 wasn't such a good move.

HARTZ: Black is weak because he doesnt have an extension on the side, so white get the chance and attacks. Well done ¡]
;B[lq]C[HARTZ: I am not sure about what is the reason behind m3. I am afraid it is for getting territory at bottom right corner and if so it is a bad move. The right idea is to attack white with a counter pincer, but instead a m3 a k3 or l3 move would be better. White should run then and black would run also while reducing somewhat white left side territory.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[kq];B[mc]MA[dj][qj]C[Is this too slow? Black is doing OK upper right, is it better to play R10 or D10 ?

Ted: I think that R10 or D10 are both bigger than N17 right now.

HARTZ: True, any move at any of the sides would be FAR bigger. The question is if white could kill the g17 black group and that, right now, is very difficult.]
;W[pj];B[qg]MA[dj]C[Looks like Black is too concentrated on the top and to right; something like D10 is better?

Ted: Not only may Black be overconcentrated; White should be able to invade at R17, which will take away a lot of what Black would like to have as territory right now.

HARTZ:  You make the very right comment in this position :)]
;W[qm];B[qn]C[Ted: This isn't such a good move.  R5 or S5 would be better.

HARTZ: You are right again, but I would like to add a go proverb "dont touch the stones you are attacking"]
;W[rn]
(;B[ro]MA[qo]C[Now
that I know he played R5 next, maybe R5 is a better move here?  I
probably played S5 to 'block' him from the corner.

Ted: I think you should have played R5 or S5 a move earlier, instead of R6.  But in this situation, I do believe that R5 is probably better than S5.

HARTZ: very good commentary. The problem is not s5 but r6 before.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[pn];B[po]MA[dj][go]C[Too small?  He ignored it.  Maybe D10 or somewhere around G5 to harass the H3 group?

Ted: I think it's okay for White to ignore this move.  C10 is big enough that you can sacrifice the S5 stone, too.

HARTZ: You are right.];W[ri];B[qn]C[Ted: You didn't need to play this -- it only gets you one point, and the left side of the board is still much more important!

HARTZ: this black move is really a disaster. I would like to emphasize now the topic of  "sente" or iniciative. Black is losing it again and again. So Maybe this could be a good example to teach him what sente is, and how important is always at go.]
;W[pm];B[qo]C[Ted: Oh, dear!  You're still fighting over one lousy point

HARTZ:  Well, this is even worse ....];W[rl];B[sn];W[rm];B[kr]
;W[jr];B[lr];W[iq];B[dn]TR[dq][cr][dr]SQ[cp][cq][hq][br]C[I was trying to move toward the left but was not sure how.

Ted: A simple move like C10 should help you, although you will likely have to worry about the bottom group eventually, too.

Alternatively, you might want to look at what White did after playing at H2 and how it affected your group.  You might be able to do the same thing to White in the corner.  You don't necessarily need to kill White of course, just make White get a small life while taking more territory on the other side.  Playing further to the left puts pressure on the White group by threatening B1 as well (which serves to take away eyespace from White).

HARTZ: Well done by explaining him how the white reinforcement at h3, have an effect on the black stones at the corner.]
;W[cn];B[rh]C[HARTZ: Again a "gote" or move that lose the iniciative. I think black is not used to invade so maybe an explanation about invasions would be good. The idea is to explain him that he would be quite safe if he play at c11 for example because he could extend either side. It is very simple and easy to understand]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qh];B[rg];W[qj]C[HARTZ: by the way, this white move it is not necessary at all.]
;B[dm];W[cj];B[cm];W[bn];B[ko];W[lo]C[HARTZ: This is a good situation to explain that playing a hane is very good usually. But be ready for the cut ¡¡¡]
;B[mo];W[jo];B[ln];W[kn];B[lo]C[HARTZ: Another go proverb " dont play go if you are afraid of kos"]
;W[jn];B[dk];W[qc];B[qd]C[I never know which side is better: Q17 or R16?

Ted: I think Q17 is better here, if you can get sente.  I believe that having a wall facing towards the left, which would combine with the G17 group, is better than having two parallel walls in the Q/R16 area and the Q/R13 area.  Also, the Q/R13 group should make it harder for White to live if he should play a wrong move.

HARTZ: Good explanation. There is a problem because the s13, the important stone, it is a bit far from the corner to be of full use. At any case it is usually quite difficult to choose at what side block.]
;W[pc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[sb]
(;B[sc]C[Ted: This move is unnecessary.  So what if White gets to play T17 later?  White would benefit by just one point.  This allows White to play in a way that makes it easier to secure the corner.  I think I'd play P17 right now.  In a situation like this, the object isn't to deny your opponent liberties, but to play on the points where your opponent would want to play in order to make eyes.

HARTZ: Black now has to "squeeze" white all he can. White will survive but black will secure some territory in "sente". The main idea is not to try to kill always, but to make as many points of territory as you can WHILE attacking. That is a very important concept.]
;W[qa]C[Ted: Which is precisely what White does here!];B[oc]
;W[ob];B[nc]C[HARTZ: It is better for black to play at o18 instead.]
;W[nb];B[mb]
(;W[nh];B[od]C[I thought it was important to keep all the white stones cut off at the corner.

Ted:  The White stones in the corner are cut off right now.  I think it's better to play at O13 now.  Also, if White were to cut at P16, Black can still capture the stone in a ladder.

HARTZ: Again the only important area for both players is the left side. Black or white should play around c13. If black dont want to invade there, he better resign right now. White should reinforce his very weak c10 stone and grabbing almost the whole left side.

Another thing. If white cut at p16, much better than a ladder for black is a net. Look at variation on move 81.]
;W[mf];B[na];W[pa];B[ke]C[I don't know how to play the early middle game, so I play stones "slowly" toward the center.]
;W[ml];B[mm]C[Ted: I don't think this move is necessary at all.  White can't benefit much from playing here or at M7 next move.  I think I'd try to go toward the center from the group in the bottom left (ie, by playing a move like F8), or possibly by jumping from L15 to L13.  The latter, however, may allow White to cause problems by trying to cut at L14.

In the area where you played, M7 might be better for Black.

HARTZ: The white left side is still open, and that is the ONLY area worth playing. L13 is not bad, but the second idea should be to reinforce black d3 group with something like g5.

N7 is very small. I would probably have played at m8 at that area, not m7.]
;W[ll];B[ng]MA[cg][dh]C[Is D12 or C13 possible invasions?

Ted: I believe either is possible.  The worst that can happen in a situation like this is that you learn where *not* to invade.  :-)

More seriously, I believe that you have a good chance to get one eye along the side, with the opportunity to run out into the center, either making a second eye in the center or connecting to D9 or L15.  Plus, there may be some aji in attacking the weak stone at C10 you can use to help to get an eye.

HARTZ: If you think that an invasion is possible you SHOULD be shouting it from long ago .... like me :)]
;W[og];B[of];W[mg];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[lh];B[kg]C[My attempt to "throw more stones in the middle".]
;W[ej]C[Ted: Now, invading in the top left will be much more difficult]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[fi];W[fk];B[gg];W[gf];B[gl];W[gk]
;B[fl];W[hk];B[hl];W[ik];B[ek];W[fj];B[ck];W[bj];B[ge]C[HARTZ: This is a very slow, small move. Black should try to save his center group. And it is not so difficult, just h13.]
;W[fg]
(;B[fh]C[Ted: I think you should play G12 here instead of F12, or else try H14 and hope that White responds by saving the stone in atari.  See the variations.]
;W[gh];B[hg]C[White
has a lot of territory upper left and on the left in general. I felt
hopeless because he has such a big area secured, while I have to fight
to defend mine everywhere else on the board.

HARTZ: He is right, so the question is to try to "see" it earlier. And take the proper actions, of course :)]
;W[hf];B[ig];W[hi];B[jh];W[jf];B[if];W[kf];B[je];W[lf];B[ie]
TW[ra][sa][pb][qb]C[HARTZ: Again, this connection is not necessary, so maybe a variation would help him. Try to make him think about "What happen if I dont play there?". It is clear that after white j15, black h15 is a double atari.]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[kh];B[nl];W[nk];B[ni];W[mh];B[oj];W[pi];B[ok]
;W[mj];B[nj]C[Ted: I think this is a big mistake.  You need to play at P7 to keep all your stones connected.

;B[in];W[go];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[hn];B[io]C[Ted: Sacrifice the H5 stone and play F5 followed by J7.]

;W[fr];B[eo];W[kl];B[jk];W[dp];B[eq];W[kj]C[HARTZ: Black has now the possibily of saving his ef11 stones by playing g11. Not very easy to see but beautiful.]

;B[gb];W[ga];B[he];W[ff];B[ij]C[Ted: As I pointed out earlier, the correct play here is at G11.]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[eh]C[HARTZ: Another worthless move because he has two move for connecting.]

HARTZ: I think that it is very valuable to make a final commentary on the overall strenghs and weakness that we have found in the game. I would have talked about "sente" and not having to answer each move of the opponent and about not being afraid of  invading and fighting.

So to your review. I think that most of your comments were to the point but maybe  "whole board" commentaries were scarce. Probably a few variations of the corners possibilities would be of help also.]
