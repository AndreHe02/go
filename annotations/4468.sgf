C[Dear Reviewer:

Hi! Thank you for your time!

I am white in this game and my questions probably are focused most on the direction of attack and the efficiency of the attacks. Of course, My Fuseki is also not good so please give me some comments. And I also have some problems regarding the two-space extension. Thank you again!]

(;B[ec]C[w: slow move for black?

janr: black needs a protective move in the joseki. Though this is not exactly the joseki, the aji of the variation may be annoying.
The joseki is commonly in dictionaries];W[kc]C[w: was this a good point? or did it just create a problem?

janr: there is more empty space on the lower side.
First try to take the biggest empty places.
In the game, white has a weak group without a clear compensation.]

(;W[kb]C[Usually white wedges in to get cutting points in blacks shape, get stronger and hope for sente]
;B[fe];W[qj]C[w: was this tenuki alright? or unacceptable?

janr: I dont know. Personally, I would run out to avoid getting enclosed in sente.]
;B[ge];W[fb]
(;B[jd]C[janr: this is probably not the best way for black to get sente]
;W[eb];B[db];W[lb];B[mb]C[janr: this looks a bit endgame.  If blocking would be sente, it would be big, but here it is gote.]
;W[jp];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe]LB[og:B][oj:A]C[w: does white need to respond to this?

Janr: yes, normally white plays A or B now.  Tenuki is possible, but white can be attacked easily.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro]
(;W[rq]LB[nr:A]C[janr: this order is not so good i think.  Black A is sente now]

(;B[qn];W[nr];B[mq];W[ck]LB[ch:D][oj:A][dn:C][fq:B]C[janr: this move looks quite slow.  A move around A is urgent to reduce the influence of the two black walls.  If white plays on the left or bottom, I would prefer B or C. At least, on the left side I would like to play on the 4th line as D is already low and very strong.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[cn]C[w: at this point, I believe the game is quite even considering black has sente. However, as white, I feel comfortable and in a lead, and the only uncertainty is the 2-space extension on the right, so thats where the battle should be. so, how should black attack white?

Janr: I think one way is to make a wall as in the game; and then try to make territory in the center.
On the other hand, black can also first play in the center and then choose to build a wall or take away white's base.  Maybe white overestimates the value of a two-space extension: usually, these groups are alive but do not make a lot of points.]

;W[ml];B[dj]C[janr: this is quite deep];W[cj];B[di];W[eg]C[w: How about these few moves? was white 82 slow or was there a better move?

janr : white 82 is ok as it splits off the two black stones that invaded too deeply.]

;B[la];W[ia];B[hd]C[janr: if this move is not sente, it is very slow.]
;W[ig]C[janr: indeed, this was originally the area where black could make territory.]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[gl];W[hj]LB[kg:A]C[
Maybe white A is a simpler way to reduce black.];B[gc];W[gb]
;B[kg];W[il]C[w: do you think I have been attacking an alive group all along, so I wasted chances to decrease the upper black influence?
janr: until now whites moves reduced black territory.
However, for the last move, it seems that white has played dame, or at least white is chasing black into his potential territory]

;W[gr];B[gj];W[mg];B[mh]C[janr: It may be better to just give up the few points in the center and try to avoid that white makes point in the center]
