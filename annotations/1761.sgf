Hicaru [19k\]: hi

At first i am no good in english
please tell me
where are my wrong move?
Thank for review my game.

yoyoma:  Hi, hope my review is helpful!  I think overall you play pretty well.  You can improve several stones by just knowing when a fight is over and only small endgame points are left.  If you see this and you can ignore an opponents small endgame move to take a big point, you will gain a large advantage.]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[nc]C[any suggestion at this move


yoyoma: No problem.  There are many choices, this one seems fine.]
;B[oc]LB[jd:B][pf:A]C[yoyoma: This is normally only played if black has a stone already around A or B.]
;W[nd]
(;B[od]C[yoyoma:  Very slow move by black.];W[qf]C[or Q14

yoyoma: This move seems ok.  You could also consider just playing K17.]
;B[qe];W[pf]C[or p 14

yoyoma: Again either way is probably good.  I think maybe Q14 is better than P14 though.]
;B[oe];W[qj];B[mf]C[how to respond that move]
(;W[nf];B[ne];W[of]
(;B[le];W[ld];B[ql]C[hmmmm
how to defend it

yoyoma:  This is a good move for black, attacking your group that has invested many stones (5) but is still very weak and not getting you many points.]

(;W[op];B[pq]
(;W[qn]TR[nf][of][pf][qf][qj]C[or p 3

yoyoma: R6 is very aggressive, and I don't think white can afford to start a fight this way since the triangle group above is already weak.]

yoyoma: yes Follow him for a little to defend your group.];B[mk]
