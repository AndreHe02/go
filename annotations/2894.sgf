AB[cc][gc]C[Hello, this is ilan, AKA ilanpi at the GTL reviews.
I won't be giving too many comments on this game, because I feel that Black made most of the errors, but he will be improving so quickly, that he will stop making simple blunders by just playing more, instead of having to bear my tired commentary on specific bad moves.
In any case, I don't believe you can improve just by having one move corrected, you must think in terms of your whole approach to the game.
From this point of view,  White played very well: his strategy was to separate Black, and it worked. Black's failure was that he let White separate his two groups on the right, and one of them died as a result. 
In the future, Black should think more about keeping his groups connected. Black still hasn't gotten his "range" right,  that is, judgeing  how far to play stones so that they are still connected.  As I write in the review, that is something that can't really be taught, I'm afraid,  you need a lot of experience to gain a feel for it.
White played very well and had a good consistent  strategy backed up by solid moves. White only showed some weakness in the end in which he played incorrect or superfluous moves to ensure life. It is possible that the superfluous  moves were played with full knowledge that he was well ahead and that he  wanted to avoid complications. However, the situation was simple enough to indicate that the aspect of the game that  White needs to work on is  the endgame.
 I will only analyse in some detail the end of the game, in which White could try to kill Black.]
;W[ec]C[The separation strategy is a good idea];B[cf]C[This move is a little "thin", which means that it is not  solid enough to bear the harsh attack that White is no doubt planning.  Otherwise, it is not too bad.]
;W[ee];B[ff]C[On the other hand, this is much too thin. Unlike the left side, the connection between the two right stones is not ensured, as White proves.
Black's strategy is clearly to capture as much territory as possible, but Black's idea of a move which takes territory is incorrect. A move at the 4-4 point doesn't do this.]
;W[ef];B[db]C[White's play is good. Black's response ignores the attack on his stone on the bottom right, which is not a good thing.
The general principle is that you should play at your weakest stone or group, which is now the 4-4 stone on the right. The left side is strong, so you shouldn't play  there.
As I said at the beginning, this advice is basically  useless. I have known  the principle "play from your weakest stone" for over a year, but I never think of it in the heat of battle. The second reason my advice is useless is that the reason I know that the left side is strong is because I have played over 10,000 games of 9x9. I wouldn't expect someone at your level to be sure.]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[dc];B[cb];W[fe];B[gf]C[OK, you can't connect as White shows, but this ends up not too badly, as Black ends up living at the bottom.]
;W[ge];B[fg]C[Empty triangle, which is generally regarded as a bad move. However, in the  heat of battle, it is often a good move. Go figure.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[eh]C[Once again, I can't fault White's moves.]
;B[fh];W[ei];B[hd];W[he];B[hf];W[ie]C[This move does not generally occur to someone weaker than 10K, who would usually try to gain time by playing  at J4. However, White's move is better because playing at J4 essentially forces Black to play at J3 and then H2, which allows him to live.  In other words, J4 does the same as this, except it ends up letting Black live.]
;B[hh];W[ce]C[Black lives anyway, but not as solidly as if he had also played J3.]
;B[be]C[Good move];W[cd];B[bd];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg]C[Good move]
;B[bf];W[dg];B[ag];W[af]C[This is a very good move, as it reduces Black's liberties, forcing eventually to connect at B7. Actually, with this move, Black's group is more  vulnerable to later attack.]
;B[ah];W[bh];B[ae];W[id]C[This is the first questionable move by White. It is clear that White is afraid that  Black will live, or will make an eye and get a seki. However, Black cannot live, and since White has an eye at C3, all he needs to prevent any kind of seki is to make a second eye by playing D4.]
;B[de];W[dd];B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[fb];B[df];W[gd]C[White is being careful.]
;B[if];W[bi];B[af]
(;W[fi]C[This is a good move. But White could have tried to kill his inexperienced opponent by playing at B8.]
;B[gi];W[fc]C[This is not necessary since White can always make this eye or another one by capturing at H6.]
;B[bb]C[As shown above, this move will be necessary once White fills in Black's last outside liberty.]

There are two variations: Black A9 seems to lead to Black death, while Black B9 lives.]
