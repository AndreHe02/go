C[I didn't find any big blunders. My impression is that you fell behind early and almost caught up. You needed to invade or reduce the upper right much earlier.]

C[squeeze];B[go];W[jo]C[is this the right side? i wanted to create thickness to attack the B moyo

Yes, I like this side. It helps to stabilize your lower right group. The lower left is already strong, so playing on that side would not be as good.]
;B[eo];W[cn];B[gm];W[jm];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl]C[By this point, the black group is fairly strong. This move (and the next) make some nice territory but don't really threaten the black group. Since it is only a territorial move, look around and see if there are bigger territorial moves (upper right).]
;B[dk];W[ck]C[I think C9 is slow. Worth some points but not a big deal. This would be a good time to do something about the black moyo. Standard possibilities are R14, R17, and P9 (P9 prepares for invasion or followup at P6). I would probably go with R14.]
;B[nn];W[jj]C[I think the center can be reduced either from this direction or from the left side (F14, F11), so the the center is the wrong area to focus on. It is hard for black to make something in the center. The right and upper side are problems here. An invasion is needed. I'm not sure what the right spot is, though.]
;B[mj]C[...but B seems to get a decent one anyhow, and I don;t really look too thick.

Yes, I think white is behind here, but black is still invadeable. This is a good time.]
;W[fk]C[Black can probably ignore this move. The black group is not really very weak. Imagine a black play at j3 for example if the black group were trying to get eyes. F9 is purely an attack move (doesn't help to build anything) and is not a strong attack. I don't think there are any strong attacks available here.]
;B[fl];W[dj]C[ This is a little better. It has some territorial value. Upper right is much more important though.]
;B[gk];W[fj]C[Why save that stone? If your goal is to make a wall, play h10 and aim to sacrifice the f9 stone.]

;B[qc];W[od];B[pe];W[nc];B[pb];W[oc];B[nf]C[i guess there was no way to stop this

Probably not. It is almost guaranteed when you invade one part that another part will get stronger.]

N12 is too deep. I'm not sure about M12. 
I don't see any really good alternatives in the area. If you want to do this, maybe make a preparatory move around K13 first, threatening to save the h15 stone? Alternatively, you might try protecting your own territory with N5 or B16.]
