;B[cp];W[eq];B[do]C[mattn: A pincer here is appropriate.  You want to activate your Q3 stone by extending from it, so a pincer is natural.  D5 is locally OK but doesn't take black's development into account.]
;W[qo]
(;B[jq];W[hq];B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[pk];B[pe];W[qh];B[nd]C[mattn; I don't think black has the luxury of this play.  The wall black gets from pressing can no longer affect any white stones since the Q9 area is safe.  Q17 seems better.]

;W[qf]C[mattn: Much to slow for W.  J15 is a huge point for both players, as is C10.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[og];W[qc];B[rc]C[mattn: B should tenuki and play D15 or so.  This corner is very small, the left side is worth quite a bit.]

(;W[qb];B[re]C[mattn: No need for this, unless maybe you are trying to attack the Q13 group.  Don't try to attack that!  Take the big points along the side, force white to scramble for territory.  THEN you can start attacking things to finish the deal.]
;W[rf];B[ie];W[hd];B[de];W[fd]C[mattn: Black was very lucky to get the last two big moves of the fuseki.  Both players missed many chances up to here.]

C[mattn: The last few moves were good for black, preparing for what should be a strong middlegame full of chasing weak groups.]

(;B[qi]C[mattn: Nice idea, but white sees through it.  See the variation for a similar idea.]

(;B[hm];W[co];B[dp];W[es];B[gr];W[bo];B[br]C[mattn: Even if this works, did black read it out when he played F3?  Much better to play the simple, solid moves.  Then you can predict the outcome and choose moves that will win instead of moves that "probably" will win ;)]
))
(;B[fo]C[mattn: In situations like this you want to find the most solid move for the kill.  Often this means starting with some strong restricting move from the outside before playing a vital point.  White seems to have no answer for this move and dies.]

(;B[ks]C[mattn: B can play here first to prevent the white connection.]
;W[ms];B[ip];W[iq];B[jo];W[is]))
(;B[jo]C[mattn: As you saw, the net doesn't work because of wN5.  Because of this, you shouldn't play M5 at all.. instead, just try to get your groups out and safe.  N6 is better than O6 for running since wM5 is a forcing move if you play O6.]

(;B[iq]C[mattn: This is probably better, puts a little pressure on the white group while otherwise being the same as K2.]
