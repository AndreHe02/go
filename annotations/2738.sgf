C[Dear reviewer
I played black in this game and I lost by resignation.
I tried to play very solidly. After 25 moves I realised  that had won territory at the left side but my opponent was very strong outside and had build a huge moyo. I tried to reduce this moyo but obviously not found the right way.
In fact I believe the main error already must have been in the beginning were almost all of my stones were at the four right lines.]

C[Here black loses sente by playing b18. I'd prefer keeping sente at this moment.]

Which of my first 25 moves were strategically wrong?
How can I now encounter the white thickness towards the center yet?

White is really very thick. So black must patiently counter the thickness. See variations.]

(;B[hl];W[ij];B[io]C[I tried to confuse white as much as possible because I saw now other way to reduce  whites moyo.

Confusing might turn against you. You should try to reduce in such a way, that you stones are always connected to a living group.]

It looks better for black. Black got much stronger. But white has sente. Now playing in upper right corner is important.]
