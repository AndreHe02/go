AB[pd][dp]C[<W> Hi, I will be marking my comments like this. I play as 3kyu on KGS, and very much enjoy making reviews to teach go. Feel free to ask me for reviews directly.

If you do not know an expression I use, I suggest http://senseis.xmp.net (Sensei's library) as a resource to look them up.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[nq];W[qn]C[<W> All pretty standard so far. You have three consecutive stones on the third line, but here they give you a strong base.]
;B[pq]C[<W> Not usual, not good for black, he gets too heavy]
;W[qq];B[or];W[op];B[qr];W[oq];B[pr];W[np];B[rq];W[qp];B[rp]
;W[mq];B[nr]CR[mr]C[I liked the way this series went, I like to play for center influence, and I thought him living small in the corner and I having a healthy wall was a good trade.

<W> It is, but you can do even better, playing n2 now cuts black off from the lower side.]
;W[fq]CR[mr]C[<W> Now black can play M3 M2 N4 or a number of plays to get the upper hand and perhaps even eliminate the influence of your wall.]
;B[dn]CR[mr]C[<W> Perfect opportunity to N2, you can even the game here already.]
;W[dr]CR[mr];B[cq]CR[mr];W[iq]CR[mr]C[<W> This seems a bit too loose, black can easilly play L3 and put preasure on you, or close you in from above. I would have played F5 or J4, to get out towards the center, a goal that harmonizes with your O4 wall.]
;B[jd]CR[mr]C[<W> N2 remains unplayed for much of the game, and you could have and should have played it at almost any time. You see later when black plays on the lower edge why it is so big.]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[ci]TR[cf][qf][qi][qn][fq][iq][mq]C[I like the way the board looks at this point.

<W> This is a bit too low, get up on the fourth line, so you are harder to surround, and can get more territory. A good rule of thumb is to not put too many stones on either the third or fourth line, but to alternate them as much as possible. Your right and bottom sides suffer the same symptoms so it seems it's an area where your play can improve alot.]
;B[ck];W[eo]C[In hindsight my opponent ended up with huge territory at the top of the board, would an invasion  at this point be worthwhile?  If so where, or is it too late?

<W> You stand to gain as much territory in the center. There's a saying; if black gets all the corners, white wins. But a move around E14 is very useful in that it both reduces blacks territory on the top, and makes you harder to surround. Always try to let all your groups have atleast one arm "in the air" so to speak, ie towards the center.]
;B[fe];W[do];B[co];W[cr];B[br]CR[cm]C[<W> Now you can play C7, and black has no choice but to C6, which enables you to cut off his C9 stone.]
;W[dq];B[el]C[<W> Here alarm bells should go off. You are getting surrounded, and must do something about it.]
;W[bq];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp]
(;W[ep]LB[ep:A][cq:B]C[<W> Here you should just fill C3 instead.]
;B[aq];W[en];B[cq];W[dm];B[cm]CR[dl];W[cn]CR[dl]C[Would D8 have been better?
<W> Yes. You have massive influence in the center, and can easilly cut away more of black.]
;B[bn]CR[dl]C[<W> You can still play D8.];W[dn]CR[dl];B[dl]
;W[fl]TR[cf][ci]C[<W> Too close to black thickness, play away. You are also forcing him to capture your already weak group.]
;B[fk];W[gl];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[me]C[Something I haven't done much, and was trying here, was to use sente moves to build a wall.  Was this a bad idea at this point, did I help him make the top impenetratable?

<W> This is good, you are getting a huge moyo in the center.]
;B[lc];W[if]C[<W> This is too far, as you will see. You should pull back here, take L14 perhaps even play somewhere around tengen.]
;B[kf]C[<W> Black cuts trough to your center. Fall back, N12 or L11]
;W[gg];B[eg];W[gi];B[jh]C[<W> Black just walks further into your moyo]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[gj];B[ch];W[bh]C[<W> This is a waste, you are already dead here. Better to use your sente elsewhere, and save this area for ko threats.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[be]C[<W> Here black makes two approach moves, and you answer both, in effect dying in gote. When black approaches from one direction, an often overlooked option is to extend in the other direction. This is what happens in the often repeated opening pattern of Q16-R14-O17. At this particular point it usually would not matter, you could abandon your dead group and play elsewhere. But there is a trick here if you can spot it... See the variation.]

;W[mg];B[lk];W[ji];B[kh];W[ii]C[<W> This move does little. Your stone is unimportant, connecting it does not serve any purpose but saving a few points.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[ol]
(;W[kj]LB[kj:A][mj:B]C[<W> Don't threaten to cut, just cut. See variation. A rule of thumb for these situations is to never threaten the opponent unless it is with some purpose (beyond hoping he won't answer). You just make him stronger, and remove your own options.]

C[Foolish mistake, something I still do with regularity.

<W> By now it is not a moyo, now it is territory. Practice looking for real moyos, big areas you might turn into territory.]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[<W> I'l repeat the main points I think will help your play:
* Alternate the third and fourth line for maximum influence, territory and stability.
* Always let your groups on the edge or the corner have the option to run to the center.
* Look for where you surround a big area, that's a moyo. It is not territory, but it can become it, if you are willing to pull back a bit.
* Try to let every move on the board have a big purpose. Never save single stones if they do not play an important part, and don't peep where you might be able to cut at some future point. The very end of the endgame is the exception to this rule.]
