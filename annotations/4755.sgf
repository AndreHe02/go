C[Hi. My name is Go Newbie and this is my game in Pandanet. I play as white here.

CZR: My name is CaeZaR on kgs.  Not been online for a while.  Glad to review your game for you.  I'll post general thoughts as you are new.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dj]C[This is unusual. What should I do if
I caught in a play like this next time?];W[qd]LB[pc:A][pd:B]
[dp:C]C[CZR: 'A' or 'B' is preferable over the marked stone, although this is the right corner to play in.  If you had played around 'C', a black stone would be natural at 'A' or 'B'.]
;B[dq];W[pj]TR[jc][jd][jq]C[CZR: You should think about playing in the marked areas.  White should not mirror black as black will then be always one move ahead.]
;B[jp];W[jd];B[he];W[jf]C[CZR: I think that was a good exchange for you.]
;B[hg];W[jh]C[CZR: Another good exchange, the territory you are gaining outweights that of your opponent.]
;B[hi];W[jj];B[im];W[nj]TR[lq][mq][nq]SQ[cn][co]C[CZR: This move gains nothing; it is too small in that it claims no territory.  Your strength in that area makes other areas better alternatives.  Either you should strengthen Q4 with a play in the triangled area.  The other (probably better) alternative is to invade Blacks area by the squares.]
;B[ln];W[pn]C[CZR: With the last two passive moves on your part, blacks moyo (RTM, if you don't know any terms I'm using) is getting larger and yours is getting smaller.]
;B[mp];W[pl]TR[nj][pj][cn][pn][co]C[CZR: Far to passive, this area has to many of your stones and is crowded.  You have no stones on one half of the board and this is a problem.  The marked area is still a good alternative.]
;B[nr];W[hd]LB[hc:A]C[CZR: Touching your opponents stone usually starts a fight.  More gain would be seen in this area by playing lightly at 'A'.]
;B[id]C[CZR: This is a mistake.];W[ic]LB[ie:A]C[CZR: You followed up on the wrong side, allowing black to connect to weak stones at 'A' and making them much stronger. 'A' is the right move for you, keeping the two stones seperate and weak.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[hc]C[CZR: This is a natural cut for black.];W[gc]
LB[hb:B][gd:A]TR[cn][co]C[CZR: After black plays 'A', this move is awful. 'B' would be an improvement over 'A' in that it won't make for a stranded stone after black 'A'.  The triangled area is still badly needed.]
;B[gd];W[hb];B[hd]C[CZR: Black shouldn't care this much about a single stone.]
;W[gb];B[ib];W[jc];B[fc];W[jb];B[ia];W[ha];B[ga];W[ja];B[fa]
C[CZR: Black has made some bad moves and that has gained you some territory on the upper side, but blacks presence on the whole board is still bigger.]
;W[fb];B[nn];W[lj]C[CZR: See comments on move 20.];B[ml];W[nl]
TR[oj][ok][pk]SQ[cn][co]C[CZR: This move secures the triangled area for you, which is very small.  A move by the squares potentially takes 15+ points away from your opponent.  This is probably enough to think about for one game; the comments from here on will be spotty.  Look to make larger, more framework building moves at the beginning of the game.  Don't fight for 2-4 points unless it is urgent (groups might die).]

;B[fo];W[le];B[oc]LB[qb:A]C[He is invasing my area and I do wrong thing to prevent
his invasion. Please give variation to prevent enemy's
invasing here.

CZR: White 'A' in response leaves no where for black to go in the corner (and the invasion would fail completely); taking the corner away is the best idea as it is the easiest to defend.]
;W[nc];B[qc]LB[rc:A]C[CZR: 'A' is still a better idea, securing the corner for yourself and moreover so that black does not get it.]

Please review my game.

Maybe this game isn't very good, but I sure enjoyed
a lot.

The komi is 6.5. If I change the komi and then save
this game, it'll error. Also if i write the point it'll
error again. so please understand.^^

Thx before.

White wins 34.5 points

CZR: Black lost the game when bad tactics allowed your invasion on the left hand side.

I'm glad you enjoyed the game. I trust you'll think about my comments.  I hope you gain strength.]
