C[First off, thank you for reviewing my game. I thought that I would play a stronger player. I am ranked 29k on KGS and my opponet was 27k. I have gone through the game and made notes where I thought I could have done something different. I think that at times I am too conservative in my moves.


Hi Aaron,
I'll try my best :) I'm currently listed at 20k at kgs. So please take my comments with care.  

Feel free to contact me if you have any  questions. 
/Axel];B[pd];W[cp]LB[pj:A]C[Your next move at A was very timid.  Players usually take the corners in the first moves because making territory this way is very efficient and easy.  

Taking corners as the first moves also upholds the overall balance on the board.  Or - in more understandable words -
playing at A gives you influence on the upper right side but white can lay out much more territory by playing at a corner.
Furthermore, playing at A doesn't secure territory as good as you might think. Remember, stones on the fourth line give influence, stones on the third territory. The most prominent example of this is the 3-3-Invasion (http://senseis.xmp.net/?33Invasion).

So, which corner to take when playing at A is not so good?
And by which move?]
(;B[pj];W[cd];B[qq]LB[pp:A]C[This stone stands in complete contrast to your other stones because it is low (taking territory) which neglects influence. You are basically offering to white 'A'  as  a good starting point to counter the influence of the stones above.]
;W[ec];B[dj]LB[dh:A][dl:B][ep:C]C[I played D10 because I thought it might have some influence latr on in the game.
------------------------------------------
D10 is good because it denies white the chance to make a very good extension from the upper right corner.  White would have liked to have a stone at D10. White can now only extend to A which is too near the corner (in other words: the stones C16, E17 and A claim too little territory in this stage of the fuseki. Just compare what they stake out to what the three black stones on the right stake out). It is definitely the correct direction to approach the upper left corner if(!!!) black had a stone at the lower left corner. But....
D10 is misplaced because 
- when white extends to from B black either gets a weak group or loses the initiative when he has to make a base
- there are bigger points on the board left, I would have played C

Regarding your motivation: You played in the lower right corner a stone which emphazises territory over influence. If white would play properly at that corner,  a lot of the influence you expect out of D10 would be negated.

I want to emphazise a point here: If you - instead of white - have a stone at the lower left D10 is the perfect place to play for you to play.  Why? Because it is a very good extension from the upper left corner and at the same time a good extension from the lower left. Playing there would serve a double purpose, extending from your position and denying white a very good extension]
;W[cl]LB[fj:A]C[First, this is the correct side to approach D10, but take a look at the whole board. What is the problem with this move? (See variation).
Anyway, I remember situations like this in my own games. Usually it ended up me running (not a good idea because your enemy makes cheap profit while you achieve nothing) or living small on the side.

Your next move (A), i.e. running, was not a good choice. If you have the opportunity to make a base, do it (see variation). A base won't relief you of all problems but it will make life easier. 

Running for the center should be the last choice. You basically accept that your stones can't live on the border and therefore they provide an excellent target for your enemy to attack.]

(;B[fj];W[jc]C[Same problem as earlier for white. A lower-kyu player could give you a cool variation how white loses the game by a lot of points. Furthermore it is not the biggest point. Any idea where on the board better positions are located?]

(;B[of]C[This move was not good!

First, there are a lot of big points on the board to take, instead you chose to increase your territory by a very small amount (4 or 5 points?).  If your intention really was to secure territory, remember that the corner is still open for a 3-3invasion.]
;W[gq]LB[eq:B][fq:A]C[Not very ambitious by white. Furthermore it invites a black extension from the lower right corner, which would create a moyo for black (well, it would create a moyo if the stone at R3 would be on the star point.). The extension also lacks connectivity to the corner. Usually the extension is played one line closer to the corner (A) or a proper corner enclosure (B) is done.]
;B[pn]C[Again, very very timid. It took you five moves to stake out the right side. Three are sufficient. Furthermore you gave white the opportunity to take hold of the rest of the board.]
;W[kq];B[nq]C[I think that I am not being daring enough here at  O3.
------------------------------
You could have extended one more line, say N3, but it is way too late for a good extension from the corner.  All the good points have been taken by white while you only took care of the right side of the board. 

It seems like your intention in the first moves was to ensure at least some territory while neglecting any questions relating to your long-term profit. By doing this white was able to stake out much much more than you.

Take a look at the whole board. The black stones on the left are floating around. They are much more important (in terms of profit) than the enclosure at O3]
;W[ch]C[This was definitely the best point for white (well, if it would have been on the fourth line). Now the black stones don't have anymore the opportunity to form a base. You are now in a situation you don't want to get into: A weak group under attack.

The whole center is empty so living should not be a problem, but white makes easy profit while threatening you all the way.]
;B[hj]LB[eg:B][em:A]C[Your stones form an eyeless string.  A move at A or B instead would have given your stones good shape.]
;W[jj];B[fl]LB[eg:C][gg:B][em:D][gm:A]C[Good, you saw that you have to live in the center instead of trying to run further. Nevertheless this is not a good move to build eyes. I know that at your level it is hard to see how to make life in the center. Take a look at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shape . I would have taken A,B,C or D, probably C or D because white is overextended at the side.]
;W[il];B[hl]C[I wanted to form a good shape, so I could fight confidently here and preoccupy my opponet.

----------- 
First, it is a situation you should have avoided in the first place. Second, you were able to play at the vital point of the shape because white didn't play it.]

(;W[im];B[gl]C[Absolutely no need for this move. You should have started building a second eye instead.]
;W[hh]LB[eg:B][gg:C][eh:A]C[Again not a point to deny black some eyespace. Furthermore it doesn't secure territory. A, B or C are better moves for this purpose.]
;B[gj]C[I think that I focussed too much here on making good shape rather than making more meaningful moves elsewhere.
-----------------
You're not making good shape. Instead both of your last moves destroyed some of your shape.  Your stones provide an even better target for white now.
When white hits the vital point of your shape now...]
(;W[nc]C[Not the biggest point.]
(;B[oc];W[nb];B[ob]C[Way too early for black.  White had to play at O18 in order to connect to K17 (a three point extension from two stones is a good extension). But for black the move at P18 secures only some marginal territory.  Making shape for your stones at the left is more important because it would deny white of making cheap profit while attacking your stones. Also at the lower right either white or black can create a small moyo.]
;W[oa]C[I should have started to extend from P14. I think.

-----------
Yes, white plays a typical yose move, worth about 2-4 points, which is negligible at this moment.]
;B[pa];W[na];B[nd]C[good move!
you limited white possibilites while expanding your territory]
;W[pb]C[again, not a big point. When you didn't protect against the cut you created a liability which you had to handle in the yose.
Both of you are finishing a small border while the rest of the board has bigger territories waiting to be taken.]
;B[pc];W[qa];B[qb];W[pa];B[qc]C[again unnecessary.  Try to play the yose with and without a stone at R17. White should gain a few points in difference so this is just another yose move.]
;W[md]
(;B[ne]C[too defensive (see variation) ...];W[me]C[and white is therefore able to extends his moyo and minimize your prospects.]

(;B[nf]C[way to defensive (see variation)];W[mf];B[mg];W[lg]
;B[mh];W[mj];B[nj]C[Again overly defensive. In the last twenty moves or so you were following white actions. You defended wherever white played. With this strategy you won't win a single game. It is important that you take the initiative yourself. For example play some shape moves on the left and when white has defended its territory there, come back to defend.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[nl];B[gm]TR[im]SQ[em][fn]C[Ouch. Not a shape move at all. You created two empty triangles (== bad shape) by one move. The marked spots are the vital points of the left empty triangle, the right empty triangle can't form an eye because there is already a white stone on a vital point.

There is enough room above and below your stones. Use it.];W[hn]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[go]TR[dl][em][en]C[Again, you played some moves but didn't get an eye. White can play any of the marked vital points and thereby attack you and secure territory as well.]
;W[hp];B[ol]C[Again overly defensive. White needs only one more stone to secure the territory it surrounded in the last thirty moves. The group on the left still lacks eyes, which is more important for black than anything else.]
;W[nm];B[om];W[no];B[cj]C[Not a shape move. And if your intention was to reduce whites territory: That is normally fatal for a not-yet-living group. Furthermore there are better points to reduce whites territory, but this is not an issue if your group has not enough eye space.]
;W[fh]C[white secured a huge territory and limited your eyespace. An excellent move.
A shape move is now urgent!];B[eh]C[Not a way to make eyes because white can play without any danger at the vital points.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[eg];B[dh];W[di];B[dg];W[df];B[cg];W[bg]C[I let myself get laddered here.
----
That can happen. But remember to use the aji left in the stones!]
;B[ej]C[which you did..];W[ci];B[ii]C[Too late to escape];W[jh]
;B[ji];W[ki];B[ih];W[ig];B[fo]C[Not a shape move.  Remember shape is about efficiency. Your stones are getting heavier and heavier.

I'm not quite sure, but your group seems to be dead right now.]
;W[bj]C[but white doesn't take the opportunity..];B[bk];W[ck]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[aj]C[a false eye];W[bl];B[fg];W[cf];B[dk];W[dl]
;B[el]C[Now your group is dead.]
(;W[em];B[dm]
(;W[cm]C[White lets you off the hook this time...

Maybe there is a way to live for black two or three moves earlier even if white plays optimal. Nevertheless you should know by now that your group was without eyes for around 70 moves and white secured a lot of territory while you merely survived. A good deal for white and the reason why you don't want weak groups.]

[kg][gh][kh][lh][li][kj][lj][jk][kk]SQ[ig][hh][jh][ki][jj]C[You played at A, not using the (major) defects the white stones have. Which move would have exploited the defects?]

(;B[ik]C[a move worth one or two points. Removes also some bad aji for white.]
;W[jk];B[ij]C[Unnecessary. Worth one point and you lost the initiative to white.]
;W[kg]C[But white doesn't want to have the initiative either...]
;B[oo]LB[lr:A]C[Again worth a few points and loses initiative. Playing at A is worth much more and you don't lose the initiative. Having the initiative during yose is worth a lot of points!  Either you get all the moves where your opponent has to respond to or your opponent gets them!]
;W[np];B[op];W[mq];B[nr];W[mr];B[kn];W[jn]C[white should have ignored your move. You can't expect to live with your stone. 

Actually you have a few yose moves left. Do you see them?
After which do you still have the initiative? Think about the last sentence twice. Playing yose moves in the correct order is worth quite a few points.]

[pq][rq][sq][pr][qr][rr][sr][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Aaron,  a very quick overview over the game:
By move 14 white had a large lead. This happened because you were overly defensive. Claiming two corners in the first moves and then the sides is a basic and good fuseki strategy. From move 16 to move 100, when yose began, the game was mainly about your group on the left. You have a tendency to play heavier moves instead of light ones.

Adapting a better fuseki strategy and a lighter style will improve your strength by a few stones. And if you don't know whether a move is too defensive or not, just try a more aggresive move and look whether your opponent shows you that is was an overplay or not.

Hope you enjoyed the review and learned as much as I did
