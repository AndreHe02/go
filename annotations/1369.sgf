AB[dp][pd][dd]C[z:  This game was played on IGS between FUKUBEN (14k*) as black and zenjutsu (11k*) as white with a 1/5 time limit.  The review is requested by zenjutsu.  I will try to preface my comments and questions with "z:" (as above).  I am not accustomed to playing handicap games, so I suppose that I tend to play them like I would a normal game where I find I'm falling behind.  Please give any commentary you view will help me improve my overall go playing skills.

o: So to make te comments readable to you, i'll begin them with "o:" (Olaf). My first comment will be: 1/5 is a rather short time to play. :-)]
;W[qp]C[z:  I really have no idea what corner play is best when playing handicap.  I thought a 3-4 would be secure.

o: every move in the corner is fine. But perhaps playing for security is not the preferred strategy for play, if you are fallen behind. Does that mean you lost your initial plan right with your first move?]
;B[oq];W[np];B[op];W[oo];B[nq]
(;W[pp];B[mp]
(;W[no]C[z:  Small.  I should have played elsewhere, right?

o: hard to say, see the variation. If you are not pleased with either this move nor the variation, there must be a mistake earlier.]
;B[lq]C[o: slow too.];W[cn]C[o: what i think is urgent now is the right hand side. You just have build a wall facing it. The black hoshi at Q16 is facing it too, so both want to play there. Now it would be your chance to play there.]
;B[cp];W[fq]C[z:  Too aggressive?

o: no, keep in mind that you are "fallen behind". You have the possibilities to make a base with J3 or jump into the center, so it is not too aggressive.]
;B[eo];W[iq];B[ln];W[ck]SQ[go][em][dr]C[z:  Should I have played elsewhere?  I was considering the marked spots, and opted to stick with a touch of caution.

o: You should be happy to be able to play on both sides. Because of M6 the righthandsite looses importance a little bit.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[em];W[dn]C[z:  Bad.  I regret this stone, because the only real thing it did was strengthen my opponent.
o: I could not say it better. :-)];B[en];W[io];B[ep];W[qf]C[z:  I really wasn't confident where to play.  I don't think this is right, but I'm not the best at picking where to play in this situation.  Where should I have gone?

o: some move ago i would say this is the best point on the board. Now because of M6 you can't get a moyo easily on the side, so its value has fallen a bit. But still i think thats a good move. :-)]
;B[qm];W[qj]C[o: good.];B[qe]C[o: this way black helps you. :-)]
;W[pf];B[pl]
(;W[oj]C[o: this move makes it too easy for black to escape. With the R15/Q14 exchance your group is stable enough so you should try the cap at O8 instead.]
;B[nl]C[o: even if your corner group is alive, it doesn't contribute to your further play anymore.]
;W[mm];B[km];W[ll];B[mk];W[kk]
(;B[im];W[li]C[z:  I'm not happy with the results of my "enclose him and make a moyo" strategy.  I don't feel that I got much out of the moyo I started to build.
o: its the best you can do.];B[mi];W[mh];B[lj];W[kj];B[mj];W[lh]
;B[ro];W[qn]C[z:  This stone is a misread.];B[rn];W[rp];B[pn]
;W[po];B[qo];W[mo]SQ[nm][nn][mn]C[z:  I should have just gone straight to one of the marked spots, right?
o: i cant see your marks.];B[lo];W[nm];B[pk];W[pj];B[om];W[nc]
C[z:  I thought I could apply some pressure and make good profit.
o: the exchance on the right is a success for white. With the new influence in the center, your move seems to be exactly in the right direction. :-)]

;B[mc];W[ld];B[pc];W[mb];B[mf];W[of]C[o: too slow.];B[pb]
(;W[lc]SQ[gc][ne]C[z:  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  I think that play was time-crunch.  After playing it, I realized that I should have played elsewhere.  ...but where?  One of the marked spots?]

(;B[ne]C[o: these 2 stones are nearly valueless];W[fc]C[o: good.]
;B[cg];W[fe];B[ec];W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[rl]C[z:  Too small, right?
o: at least it is sente. Try to count an this point. Look at all groups, which are strong, which aren't. Than again decide where it is urgent to play.]

zenjutsu vs FUKUBEN : W 59.5 B 66.0

z:  Overall, I think I played "okay".  However, I'm quite unhappy with my uninspired play.  Usually, I have a play or two I'm really proud of in a game, and I just never felt that I made a really good play all game long.  Thank you for taking the time to review my game,  I look forward to receiving your comments.
o: there was no need for an extraordinary move. Count from time to time (hard in a 1/5 game), look at the status of your groups and avoid bad mistakes. That would be enough at least for this game. :-)]

(;B[lj]C[o: this would be necesarry. White is still not alive in the corner and with every move to help the corner you will induce a move to strengthen the black stones too.]

- you corner-groups reaches the center
- your side-group will be driven into the top, that area in which black wants to create a moyo.]

(;W[qf];B[no]C[o: if you play elsewhere, black gets a very powerful ponnuki in sente because i wood feel to answer now.]
