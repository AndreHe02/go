C[Commented by Rafael Caetano dos Santos, rafa 9k* IGS.];B[dp]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[qd];B[nc]C[This move is not incorrect per se, but it is usually played in special situations.
I'm not strong enough to tell you which situations, but I guess the current
position is not one of them.  It gives W the opportunity of enclosing the corner.

This approach is not very common nowadays, and it may be simpler to play the
one-point approach at P16, or P17.

Not a big deal, though.];W[oc]C[This helps B.  It is simpler and safer to play the kosumi at Q17.]
;B[ne]C[Extending at o16 is better.];W[oe];B[db]C[Your stones at the top right are a bit weak, so you should take care of them
before switching to another part of the board.   Forcing at P16, W Q16, B O16,
followed by W defending one of the cutting points, and B extending to K16,
may be satisfactory.

Besides, D18 is too defensive a move. You should bear in mind that a stone
at the 4-4 point is not intended to take (immediate) territory. You should
use it to take influence in the center.  This is not a simple matter, though.]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[fc];B[gd]C[This sequence strenghtens W, and so weakens B at the right.
A general principle: play from the weaker side.];W[gc];B[fd]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[cc];W[eb];B[cj]C[This point is big, but the situation at the top is urgent.  The B group at the top left now has 2 cutting points.
You could link at C18, threating the W group, which is not alive yet.
This would also protect against the cut at C16.

Or maybe running with the group at the right.];W[cb];B[cd]C[If you can, force before defending.  In this case, B18, then W captures, and B links
at C16.];W[bb];B[id]C[Good, trying to link up your groups. But note that W could break through at K16.]
;W[dg]C[This is dubious, since it is too near the strenght of the B group above, and it is
pincered by the B stone at C10.  It has little space to make eyes, and it doesnt have
W influence to back it up when it tries to run away.];B[cg]
C[You should grap the opportunity and attack the lone W stone.   I think this is not to the best way to do it.  Maybe the knight move at E11
would be better.   Another general principal: when attacking, you should avoid playing
contact moves, since they usually end up strenghtening the enemy.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[The cross-cut leads to complications. In this case, B can afford to cross cut, since
there is a strong wall above to back up, and the stone at C10.   Even so, it would
be enough to draw back at C12.];W[ch];B[bg];W[di];B[bf]C[Unnecessary.  C10 is alone, so B should link it up with the group above by
playing B12.];W[ef];B[de];W[eh]C[Although W invasion was a bit premature, W is fairly good now.]
;B[bh];W[ci];B[dj]C[Just link it: B11.  Then W could play a severe move: D10, but at least your groups
would be connected.];W[bi];B[ei]C[You are trying too hard to kill W.]
;W[bj];B[bk]C[Now there are 2 cutting points, C9 and E10.];W[ej]
;B[fi];W[dk];B[ck];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hh]C[Another overplay, another cutting point (h11).]
;W[hg];B[ek];W[ih]C[See?  B gave W the chance to play this atari.]
;B[hi];W[if];B[jc];W[ib];B[je]C[Good. Very important move, keeping your groups connected.]
;W[qn];B[kp]C[Big.
But you still should play at the upper right corner.  You could even keep sente.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[oh]C[Now W is forming a big territory at the right side.]
;B[nh];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[gf];W[hf]C[This is a bit awkard, but it threatens H15.]
;B[ii]C[You should cut at G13!
Then W could play H15, B G15, W H16 cutting B groups and linking his, but
both B groups live, and W group at G12 dies.];W[ji];B[lh];W[lg]
;B[mg];W[le];B[lf];W[kf];B[ke];W[mf];B[ld];W[ge]C[B loses the chance to cut.]
;B[he];W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[fe]C[The capture is very small itself.  B can only play this way if it is to kill
the W group. But this is a bit hard, since that group is out in the center.]
;W[jj];B[fk]C[Unnecessary.  The W stone at E10 cannot escape.  If you are worried
about the group at e11, it would be better to play something like H9.]
;W[dm]C[Unreasonable.];B[dl]C[Unnecessary.   Think what W could do if you had ignored D7. Would
W link at D8?  The B stones at D10 are linked anyway, so linking would be useless for W.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[em]C[You should care about D4.];W[cq];B[dq]
;W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[bo]C[This position is a bit complicated (for me) because of the surrounding W stones.
Even so, I think it is best to play the  "traditional" E2, keeping W split.]
;W[eq];B[eo];W[ep];B[do]C[W gained substantial territory in sente.]
;W[il];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[kl];B[jm];W[lk];B[kh];W[jh];B[oi]
;W[ph];B[on];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[mi];B[mh]C[Wrong.  B should give away 2 stones, and connect at O11 to save the stones
around P9.];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj];B[li];W[lj];B[pi];W[ki];B[ng]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[mm];B[lm]C[Better force at Q5 and attach at P3.]
;W[ll];B[nm];W[mn];B[qi];W[qh];B[km]C[The situation hereafter is a bit complex for me to comment, and both
sides made mistakes, but suffice to say that B's mistake was letting W cut its groups apart
at O11.   B could even steal the second eye of the big W group in the center, but its group at P10
does not have an eye, so B would probably lose the semeai (capturing race).]
