C[buckyyowza: Hello. Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed by "buckyyowza". This was quite an interesting and challenging game to review, so I used a lot of variations in this game to help illustrate the commentary.  Please don't take these to be examples of the best possible play (or even to be correct!), but as a different way to look at the board position at several points.  I hope you enjoy reading my review and find the comments to be use.  Final comments can be found at #161.

Hello,

I'm most interested in the direction of play in the opening and
middle game. In particular, I would like to know how to think
about the game, ie. why plays are made. Also, I would like to know if my logic is correct.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

- Russ (chimchim)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ce];W[gd]LB[gc:C]
[fd:B][de:A]C[Russ: This doesn't seem like joseki. Too wide?

buckyyowza:  too wide... or too high.  This works for white if black played the high approach (D15), but now it is better for white to play F16 or G17.  The reasoning is that the long knight extension is not a very strong shape and the low approach takes more of the corner, making it more important for white to develop a strong shape on the upper side.]
;B[dg]C[buckyyowza: since you approached from within white sphere of influence, a tight solid play such as this is definitely apropriate.  Since white's last play is poorly placed, you can settle easily in this direction while saving the weakness in white's group for later.

Russ: Better response? After next W move this seems to be too
narrow. Maybe I could have gone further.];W[cd]
(;B[cn]LB[dj:D][dk:C][cl:B][fq:A]TR[ce][dg]C[buckyyowza: D15 is imporant, as it retains sente (see var).  C6 is a poorly placed stone at this point: it invites white to play an easy pincer at C8 or D9, either of which weakens your stones in the upper left.  It would be better to approach from the other side (see var), or to extend to D10... after playing D15 of course ;-)

Russ: I didn't want to extend at D15. My stones would seem too
close together and W would get another good move somewhere else, so I approached
the lower left.];W[dk]C[buckyyowza: yes, this is why C6 was not well timed.

Russ: This looks like a good point as it pincers C6 and puts
pressure on stones above.];B[cq]LB[gf:A]C[buckyyowza:  I actually prefer this to E6 because it takes the action more toward the lower side, and away from the weak stones in the upper left.  If you put pressure on the pincer stone, it will in turn put pressure on D13/C15, which is bad since it is nearly impossible to fight on two fronts at once.  Black should try to retain sente here and then play something like G14 to make the best of the situation in the upper left... after D15, of course.

Russ: Jumping at E6 looks like it might be better as it would
separate W and put pressure back on W's pincer stone.];W[cp]
;B[dq]
(;W[eq]C[buckyyowza:  White cannot play like this because of C6 (should be E4).  See var for how to cut at E4 now.]

(;B[bq];W[bp];B[ep];W[do];B[fq]C[buckyyowza: This is an OK result for black since it is quite big, but loses sente.  Since white actually blundered this sequence (see #14), this would be a good result if not for the bad situation on the left side for black.  Imagine if white plays E5, then at F10 (see var).

Russ: Is this proper sequence? Not too familiar with this set
of moves. Thought that I should make sure corner was secure by
capturing stone. E5 seems good too but not sure if W has to answer it.]

(;W[er];B[fr];W[aq];B[dr]C[buckyyowza: yes, this should be at A2.

Russ: I could have blocked and connected at A2, B2 and result
would have been better. This move seems too passive.];W[eo]
;B[fp];W[dm]C[Russ: Seems slow.];B[gn]LB[gf:A]C[buckyyowza: Yes, this is a good play, though again only if the situation on the left side is resolved, which it isn't.  G14 is therefore bigger at this point.

Russ: Right move? It seemed big. Also thought of enclosing the lower right.]
;W[ch]LB[de:A][gf:B]C[buckyyowza: This area is not so big as it looks.  What is most important is to get your stones out into the center so that they might live and keep the right side thick for black.  A play at C10 or C11 would still be too small to make life on the side without giving up a lot of moyo to white.  Besides, C12 is a lower shoulder hit, which is almost always bad - here it could be considered overplay (gote uchisugi) since white doesn't need it to settle the lower left stones and it doesn't affect black's most imporant plays: D15 and G14.

Russ: This seems very good for W. It makes me think that my previous
move should have been in this area (at C10 or C11 maybe).];B[dh]
C[buckyyowza: I agree, see #37.

Russ: Seems slow to me. Only strengthens W without getting much
in return.];W[ci];B[bd]C[Russ: I felt I needed to help out these stones in this sequence.
Feels urgent.];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[ed];W[ec];B[po]LB[ef:B][fg:A]
TR[bd][dd][ed][ce][dg][dh]C[buckyyowza:  Actually the last few plays have hurt black's position in the upper left:  Black still has no eye space and a white stone at F13 all but kills all of black's stones.  black still needs to take this group more into the center to keep it in the game.

Russ: Felt I had settled upper left for now and got this big
point.]
(;W[nc]C[buckyyowza: As white, I would prefer a high approach or an approach from the right side to develop thickness against the lower side.  At this point, white hasn't got enought aji to do much of anything about that big moyo except keep sente and build thickness.

Russ: Would a W play on the right or reduction on bottom be better?]
;B[nd]C[Russ: I felt this would keep W low and build a thick position
facing bottom area, making a big moyo.];W[oc];B[pc];W[md];B[ne]
;W[kc];B[qj]LB[qf:A]C[buckyyowza:  This is a good result for black, and also a good choice of joseki.  Personally, I would have played at R14, as you cannot expect to keep all of both the right and lower side and R14 takes a more secure area.  Otherwise, R10 is perfectly all right.

Russ: Too far? I thought one space higher (Q10) might also
be ok. Q14 better? I also thought of N15 as a forcing move to press W down low, expand the moyo,
and prevent W from expanding further.];W[pf];B[pe];W[qf];B[of]
C[Russ: This move doen't seem to do enough. S16 looks much better.
It would take territory, secure the group, and take away W's
base making potential. A W move here (P14) doesn't really affect B enough.
S12 and R12 also seem possible.];W[ph]LB[oj:A]C[buckyyowza: As with anytime your moyo is invaded, it is best to assume that white's invasion here will succeed and that you should minimize it's ability to extend into black areas before trying to kill it.  Then if white fails to settle his stones once enclosed, you can kill them.  Black's best play is now P10 to preserve the big lower and right side moyos and to keep this invasion small and difficult for white to perserve.]
;B[og]LB[oj:A]C[buckyyowza: this is not bad, but I'd still prefer P10 since this essentially pushes white into black's moyo.

Russ: Too slow? I was expecting W to come out into the center
and in the process help me solidify the lower right. Also trying
to prevent W from getting good shape. S16 seems to be good. How
about R12?]
(;W[qi];B[pj];W[rd]C[buckyyowza: yes, but if black plays P12 now, he is much better off, and retains sente.

Russ: W gets good point.]
(;B[ld];W[me];B[mf];W[le];B[kd];W[lf];B[mg];W[je];B[lg];W[ic]
;B[gl]LB[kp:A]C[buckyyowza: this is OK.  I prefer L4 here as it practically ensures enough points to win.  Though white is still not thick in the center, a successful invasion on the lower side would be a big loss for black.

Russ: Too much?];W[hp]SQ[eq][er]C[buckyyowza: Right, it looks like white is blinded by some bad aji.

Russ: Seems like wrong point of attack. Too deep and close to
B thickness.];B[jp]LB[mo:B][kp:A]C[buckyyowza: this is almost too close, though still effective.  All you need to do is prevent white from getting two eyes; keeping him small doesn't matter as long as the group dies.  Since it is the right distance from Q3/Q5 and also the F3 group, I prefer L4.  K4 still leaves a potential invasion around N5 if white manages to get a center presence.

Russ: Right way to attack stone?];W[go];B[fo];W[hn]
(;B[jn]LB[fn:A][iq:B]C[buckyyowza: It is better to protect at F6 now.  Even if it looks like white will survive or connect out, black still has J3 to seal a large area on the lower side.]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[fm];B[en];W[dn]C[buckyyowza: the following sequence hurts black.  See var for a better idea.]

(;B[io]C[buckyyowza: this peep is ajikeshi; it helps white solidify his shape without and clear purpose on black's part.]
;W[ho];B[hm];W[im];B[hl];W[in]
(;B[il]LB[jm:A]SQ[gl][hl][hm]C[buckyyowza: this is wrong direction, since it pushes white into your big moyo.  The aji around E7 is all that you need here, and the marked black stones are weak, and best used as a sacrifice so I'd rather play at K7]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jl];B[jk];W[ll];B[kk];W[lm];B[mo];W[jq];B[kq]
;W[ip];B[kp]C[buckyyowza: L2 seems to work, but I think L4 is a more stable and sensible play.

Russ: L2 maybe?];W[fi]LB[ni:B][ik:A][qm:C]C[buckyyowza: yes, this is a good point for W, and this has been a problem for some time.  Black should try now to connect to the M13 group, perhaps starting at G14.  Yes, the bottom white group is still a threat: black has weaknesses around J9, O11, and R7.  Although none of these are exactly gaping holes in black's position, they seem enough for white's dragon to be able to survive.

Russ: Seems like good point for W (or B). Splits B.

Is bottom W group a threat? If W tried to live it seems like
it would benefit B more than W.]
(;B[ei]LB[gf:A]C[buckyyowza: Black has virtually no potential for eye space here and cannot live without connecting to another group.  White can simply play F10 now to block this play and strengthen his offense.  Black's best bet is still G14

Russ: Helping B upper left group feels urgent. This doesn't seem
good though. Make eye space with B13 or B14 maybe?];W[fj];B[hi]
;W[fh]TR[bd][dd][ed][ce][dg][dh][ei][jl][ll][im][jm][lm][hn]
[in][go][ho][hp][ip][jq]C[buckyyowza: these stones are now dead, see var #103.  White makes several mistakes through the next several plays, so I will point them out.  Black should focus his efforts here on killing white's big dragon in the lower center, and then reducing the J13 area. using the aji of these lost stones.]
;B[fd];W[gc];B[ff]
(;W[bf]C[buckyyowza: this allows black to connect out at G13. White should play G13 instead to kill black.]

(;B[cg];W[cf];B[be];W[df];B[de];W[ef];B[ge];W[hh]LB[hg:A]C[buckyyowza: This is poorly placed; as a rule it is better not to touch your opponent's stones while attacking unless it is part of a clearly read sequence.  This play should be at H13 instead to prevent black from connecting.]
;B[if];W[jg]LB[if:A][jf:B]TR[je][le][lf]C[buckyyowza: another misread by white.  The black stone at J14 is a tewari peep against the normally strong shape formed by white's stones.  White should play at K14 instead to avoid a severe weakness in the upper side group.  Previous mistakes have already allowed black to connect out.]
;B[kf]
(;W[jf]LB[ke:A]C[buckyyowza: should be L15 - white cannot afford to allow black this upper side invasion.  This alone is resonable compensation for black's losses on the upper left, and that situtation is not fully resolved yet.]

;B[pb];W[jh];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[jc];B[mb];W[jb];B[la];W[mj]
;B[lj];W[lk];B[li];W[oi]
(;B[nj]LB[oj:A]C[buckyyowza: P10 is still an effective cut, and prevents white from breaking in to your right side.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[ni];W[pk];B[ol];W[qk];B[oh];W[pi]
(;B[qm]LB[rj:A]C[buckyyowza: black can play S10];W[rl];B[rm]
;W[br];B[hr]C[buckyyowza: Things seem pretty much resolved at this point, so I will end my commentary here.  Black has a comfortable lead (about 10 points), and should have no trouble maintaining that margin through this endgame.

In closing, I'll just say that you need to be more careful to solidify your groups before moving on.  Strong shapes are quite an asset in the middle game, but a weak shape is always a liability.  If you're sure to cover all your bases then you'll spend less time fighting for your life and more time looking for the best play considering the whole board.  However, you'll notice that even though you made a pretty large blunder in the opening by leaving the upper left stones in a bad state that white staked the whole game on making sure those stones stayed dead and ended up giving up enough points for black to win.

Thank you for a chance to review this exciting game. It presented quite a challenge to analyze, and I hope that I haven't confused you or led you astray ;-)  If you have any further questions about this game, please don't hesitate to contact me by email or look for 'bucky' on KGS.]
