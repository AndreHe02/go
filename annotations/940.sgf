C[Hello, reviewer of the game is jean, and all comment will be preceded by  j>

j> so as to avoid any confusion with comments made by the players during the game
or in the pre-review stage ..];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd]
;W[jp]C[I think one or other player should have made an approach move by now?

j> this white move is not good, in my view ... (see var)]
(;B[qn]C[j> as B, I'd rather play this at D10 or Q10];W[np]
C[B keeps sente

j> and W is only helping B. What if B now simply plays Q10 ?]
;B[qp]C[I hate this being done to me :-(

j> then you have to choose between two options :  1. learn how to play against it :)
2. don't play o4 but a pincer instead];W[qq];B[qo]C[j> this is awful ... S3 or Q5 are the standard moves for black here

j> W must exploit B's poor shape, eg playing at s2];W[qf]C[j> if W must play on this side, i'd suggest approaching the corner further away (r13)

this R14 only helps back building on the side, with a pincer]
;B[qh]C[j> see ? ... W is in trouble cause all black stones are strong,  and W can't make an
extension on the side (which would be possible if W first played at R13 or R12)]
;W[of];B[nd];W[cf]C[j> q11 (joseki) first, or r10 maybe to try and expose B bad shape
but W must not leave the right side as it is.
If B gets sente on the left, W will have lots of trouble, after for example B P12]

;B[di]C[j> Why not connect ? if you meant to give c10 to black, then a 2 space jump would
be better];W[fc];B[ee];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[dj];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh]
;B[eg];W[ed];B[df];W[bd];B[fd];W[ec];B[de];W[gd];B[be];W[bc]
C[j> this is yose play
looks sente, but what if B decides to give you c14 back ?
B is not forced to reply here, having enough room to live near c10,
so he can cause trouble in the center];B[bf];W[fe]C[j> doesn't work, cause B is too strong on the left

h12 first, to expand in the center
f6 first, to expand lower side , reduce B's left side and begin  running for your stone
would be better moves];B[ff];W[gf];B[he];W[fg];B[ef];W[ge]C[This felt good, but I've got a lot of cutting points]
;B[gg]C[oooooo help!];W[gi];B[hg];W[hf];B[ig];W[ii];B[hi];W[hj]
;B[hh];W[if]C[j> don't chase pushing B on your weak group ...  it can only lead to disaster

secure your stones first, then attack if B fails to connect]
;B[jg];W[ji];B[ek]C[j> Kaboum !
W position in the center collapses
W should forget about capturing B H13 and sisters, give 2 stones to black
and save the rest];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[fn];B[fj];W[fi]
C[I don't like the look of this];B[gj];W[dk];B[el];W[em];B[fm]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[dl];B[ck];W[dm];B[cm];W[en]C[j> White will have a very hard time making up for the losses

Black has more territory, and is more powerful in the center, while
White still has lost stones without any base or friends in the center]
;B[ep]C[j> this is small move ...
B @P12 definitely settles the game];W[eq];B[fp];W[gp];B[bp]
;W[bq];B[bo]C[j> very small yose play ...];W[fl]C[j> what is this W move ??
It must be reserved for a ko threat
in order to improve, you must definitely change attitude regarding your moves.

of course, if B fails to answer this, W will save stones.
But, if B answers correctly, is your situation getting worse or better ?

Answer is rather obvious, since at the end of the sequence, your stones cannot link]

;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc]C[I now know that this should be played @P18

;W[lg];B[ki]C[j> L15 first,so W can't link to the upper side
(W can live on the right side, playing at s10, but will have to do it gote
if B keeps the pressure on)
(or W may die very big if B manages to play s10 himself first, and W can't link up)]
;W[lf];B[ld]C[j> this is maybe a misclick ...
B L2 is mandatory, to avoid W linking his groups];W[ke]C[Phew - B should have stopped that

j> yes. but it was a few moves before. also, don't forget W could always live with s10]
;B[kd];W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[gc];B[sj];W[kj]C[j> K9 better
you give the three stones away, if B wants them, but in exchange you get points around m6)]
;B[jh];W[jk];B[ij];W[jj]C[j> again, k8 good
if b takes the 3 stones, you can continue with n8 or such];B[il]
C[j> m8 now, if you want to save your stones];W[jl];B[im];W[hl]
C[j> bad move, reducing your liberties];B[hk]C[How can I keep that black group (J7) under control?

j> what do you mean by 'control' ?
if you meant keeping points over the 4th line, it is unreasonnable
if you want to secure your K10 group, M8 should do the work, but before you played this sequence ...]
;W[in];B[jn];W[gn];B[io];W[ip];B[jo];W[ho];B[ln];W[lo]C[I'm glad B hasn't spotted the Life & Death Ko (H6)
but looking at the gam am aware that K8 etc needs rescuing

j> h6 not real ko ... if B plays, you connect g5 and it is done. B can then connect
at either j6 or k7
Think it is too late to save k8 and friends.  But not too late for upper corner :) s18 lives (and other moves too)]

correct is p19, to play sente yose and make your group live, then you win game]
