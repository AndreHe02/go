C[this is a game where i invested a lot of time and tried to play "better" than usual.
i had thought i was ahead by a fair margin, and was surprised i had won by only 4.5 points.
it probably means i did not pay attention to some suboptimal plays by me.
hope you can help me discover them!

EE: Yes, looks like pro moves to me. :)];W[nn]C[is it ok for white?

EE: Yes.];B[nk];W[ln];B[lp];W[ci];B[fq];W[jj]C[very bold by white

EE: Slightly bold by white.];B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo];W[ep]
;B[go];W[gq];B[hq];W[fr];B[gr];W[co];B[dn];W[ll]C[hum???

EE: It is a good idea to strengthen this group
now that black got thicker.];B[ck]C[is it ok or should i have invaded earlier?

EE: This is black's first really dubious move.
Black is strong here and this extension is far
too narrow. Better invade somewhere above
c11 and try to squeeze c11 against the thickness below.];W[dj]
;B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[dg]LB[fe:a][gj:b]C[black is in a difficult situation

EE: Yes, maybe black should lean at 'a' to
get stronger. Black's aim should be to try and
reverse the attack, so that white's stones
below get attacked from the direction of 'b' (maybe too much to hope for? :-) )]
;W[ff];B[eh];W[fj];B[gh];W[hj]C[but white plays moves that can become worthless if black is not captured

EE: It is true that they don't surround territory,
but it nice to connect two potentially weak groups together. White is also neutralising black's wall below.]
;B[ei]C[is it ok?

EE: No, don't play moves like this without a
clear tactical aim, to make some particular
variation "work". They have a big price in  that they strengthen the opponent, so make sure
you get something really worthwhile back, like
eyeshape, for example.];W[ej];B[gi]C[is it ok?

EE: Same comment as before.];W[gj];B[ih];W[kh];B[he]C[EE: Black may be a bit too thin for such a long jump.]
;W[hd];B[ge]C[i was expecting var2]
(;W[ie]C[i was surprised and liked that
was i wrong?

EE: It takes pressure off your weak group so
it seems too easy on black.];B[fe];W[ed];B[ee];W[gd];B[me]LB[pb:a]
C[i decide my group can live on its own
is it a big risk?

EE: Seems safe enough. 'a' may be bigger.];W[ld];B[oc]C[i believe this to be a mistake

EE: The next black move is more dubious.];W[nd];B[ne]TR[me]
[ld]LB[ob:a]C[EE: The marked stones are a kikashi exchange, so saving the marked stone is not very important. L12 is already reducing black here.  P18 (a) seems much bigger.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qe]LB[rd:a]C[EE: If white played a, it could be hard to stop
him from living.];B[qd];W[qf];B[qg];W[qj];B[qk];W[oj];B[pj]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj]C[EE: White's moves seemed aimless and slack, and black defended well enough. White got very little from this.]

at q15 (see var.).];W[if];B[hf];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs];B[ip];W[is]
