C[hi i'm 15k kgs, thanx for reviewing my game, i made a few comments myself, but if u see anything else pls don't hesitate to comment

Hi. There were some interesting situations in this game. Thanks for the oppurtunity to recall some fundamentals ;)

Please note, that I am not a dan player. Therefore, my comments are my own opionion. Think about them - don`t imitate ;)

BTW, English is not my main language. If you have questions regarding this review don`t hesitate to write an email.

Hava fun,

;W[pc];B[od]MA[nb][rc][nd]C[was dis peep normal?since my opponent did not answer, i guess it wasn't really threating

-----
This is a standard joseki move. The books say that this is the vital point. Your fellow-player should have answered at O18 or S15. O16 is an old move and not very popular anymore.

Let`s see what happens next...];W[rd]C[-----
This is a little bit risky. Just down with S17 would be better. I think White gives you a good opportunity to close the side.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[fd]LB[fb:A]MA[de][ce][fq][me]TR[rd]C[i questioned myself about this move, it might have been too high, suppose the opponent just slide in at A?

-----
That`s true. This move is not a real threat to White and it does not help to improve your positions. Better moves are C15 or D15. F3 is a good move in relatino to Q4.

There is a proverb saying "Urgent moves before big moves"

You really should not leave the situation in the upper right.  N15 looks like the move to close the side. White helped you with S16 - you should take your chance and build a thick wall. Of course there is a slight weakness at R15....

You startet a moyo game with your sanrensei (three starpoints) opening. Building a thick wall is a good strategy.]
;W[ee];B[ec]C[was dis a good tsuke?

-----
Hm, I think you force White to take a lot of points in the corner. The problem is, that your first move at F16 was not very strong.]
;W[ed];B[eb]LB[gb:A]C[i realized this wasn't a good move since white could've went to A..dunno..pls comment

-----
It is not immediately possible for White to attack at A. Your move is good in a local context altough the whole sequence favours White.]
;W[db]MA[gb]C[-----
NOW, G18 is a threat. But White should wait to play there, because there are bigger moves.]
;B[gd]MA[gc]C[was dis a good move?

-----
I don`t think so. If you want to cover the cut at F17 a move at G17 would be better. This would also prevent White from playing at G18.

Please have a look at this corner. Regarding the sequence starting with your play at F16, who do you think gained more?]
;W[ci];B[ce]MA[fq][jp][me]C[i think  dis was a bad invasion..where do u think is best?


-----
I think you should expand your moyo and at the same time prevent White from expanding his.

It is not necessary to invade imediately. If White wants to make his corner save - fine! One big free move for you.

If you are playing a moyo game. First expand the moyos. And welcome a White invasion.

In this kind of situation a move at F3 or K4 is best. Of course in this particular game you may want to play at N15 first.]
;W[cd];B[de]MA[dh]C[-----
There is not a lot of space down there for you. You may want to get out fast... e.g. with D12

Ask yourself what you expect from an invasion. Or is it better to just reduce Whites position? It was too early to invade, there were bigger moves in the first place. But look at the situation. You can not live there (At least you should not ;), so you should not hesitate to run out and be willing to let White capture some stones.]
;W[dd];B[ie]MA[me][fq][jp][dh]C[-----

Ah. This is not consistent with your invasion. What about the two lone stones now?

This move is not very big either. I think you have better options. (marks)]
;W[eg];B[ih]C[----
This would be noce if there wasn`t the weakness atround N15. Still F3, K4 are bigger]
;W[jp]C[-----
It is a good move for White.

The biggest plays are always the points both sides want to have...]
;B[fq]LB[hq:A][nq:B]C[was dis a good move?since white could easily pincer at A and  after black extends to 3-3 den move to O3(b)

-----
It is one move too late ;)

I woukd prefer C6 to approach, because there is a little bit more space there.

But do not worry about the above sequence. If White neglects to defend his position you just take the lower left.]

;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[lr];W[np];B[op]C[i dun think dis was a good move allowed the aji of the O2 and P3 cut..


-----
You are right. Just play P3];W[on];B[ln];W[ll];B[nn]

You do not have to give that much way. Play at S5.

I will not comment much on the following moves. They are mainly endgame moves. You could improve by training your reading abilities, for example by solving problems.]

Never ever steal your own liberties! Capure White now.];W[qs]

(;B[kr]C[i believe dis was the game losing move, instead of going after the S6 stones like in variation, tell me wat u think


-----
The whole seuqence was not very nice.

But I think you are right. Your only chance would have been to seal White in with a dead shape.

The game is lost now.];W[ri];B[ms];W[qi];B[pi];W[rf];B[qf];W[se]

;B[kk]C[this move was made in attempt to destroy white's eyespace, any  other way to do it?


----
The white group is big... Hm, I think it will be difficult to capture...

But looks like a sort of vital point];W[lk];B[kj];W[li];B[ki]
