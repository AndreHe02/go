C[I've done my own analysis of the game and my comments are included. I'm particularly interested in knowing whether or not my conjectures about invading Black's territory are on the right track.  This was only the second game that I'd ever played as White: it's pretty obvious isn't it?

> Hi Ron. You've already done a good job with your comment. I will try to answer your questions.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[jp];W[pj];B[dj]C[> Yon-ren-sei Versus San-ren-sei.  Usually, the sanrensei put emphasis on influence rather than territory. So sooner or later, you will have to deal with Black moyo. Usually, An invasion / reduction will be in order for BOTH side.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[eb]LB[jd:A]C[Moving to A would have better secured White's position here.  The given move simply opens White to a Black invasion around A.

> You're right. Jumping right now would just give white a very good wall to exploit his san-ren-sei. (see variation for an example of what black should not do. )]

(;W[fb];B[eg];W[jd]TR[kc][kd]C[> Since you decided to play F18, a play at White14 feels a bit overconcentrated and should (at least) reach the triangled points.]
;B[he]
(;W[hc]LB[id:a][de:b]C[The contact move in the variation is, I think, stronger as Black's cuts at G16 and J16 are not particularly bothersome.  As it is White set the stage for further reduction moves by Black.

> You don't have to worry so much about this stone.
> If you want to avoid contact, just play A. It seems better.
> You can also force black by playing something like B (see variation)]
;B[fe];W[mq]LB[dm:A][gp:B]TR[lp][lq]C[This was too slow.  White surrendered the initiative with this move and Black siezed it.  Better would have been to move around A or B and then played as either reductions or invasions depending on Black's reply.

> I don't find this move so slow. Sure, you can go one step further, treathening  an invasion around B. If black defend, you can expand your moyo
> Also observe that the game is more or less Right versus Left. Usually, both side will aim for invasion.]
;B[pg]C[> Here comes black invasion.];W[nc]LB[qf:a]C[> I find this too easy on black. you should be ready to fight with something like A]
;B[pm]LB[nj:a]
(;W[ql]LB[nj:a]C[> This is too submissive. Here the weak stones are the black ones. If you simply jump to A, Black will have to work hard if he want to save both stones. (see variation at A)]
;B[nm];W[qh];B[qm]
(;W[rm];B[qo];W[qp];B[np];W[nq];B[kr]LB[dm:A][gp:B]C[White is now severely restricted in the lower right.  An invasion/reduction is still possible around A or B.  White's given move is too small and hands Black still more territory.

> true];W[jf]LB[if:a];B[cq]LB[gp:A][dm:B]C[By moving at C3 Black greatly reduces the power of any White invasion at A or B.  Even if White moves to one of those points there is no longer any threat to Black's rear.  Thus, both moves are left as reductions.]
;W[oh]LB[ph:A][qg:B][kh:C][mg:D]TR[mk]SQ[dm][gp]C[Too timid.  A direct contact move at A or B would have been stronger.  Also, as White's moyo needs expanding a move around C or D would have influenced more territory and put further pressure on Black's Q13 stone.

> You're absolutly  right. C and D are even slow. You can give a try around  the Triangle point. But playing a reduction move
 toward black thiness (square) seems to be even better. Anyway , Black Q13 should die naturally when expanding your moyo.]
;B[jj];W[kh];B[jm]
(;W[hg]C[> This is a reasonable move. But black is more than 10 point ahead so White should'nt be reasonnable. You can try an unreasonnable reduction and fight.  Or try an invasion (and also fight).]
;B[gj];W[hi]LB[lk:A][dl:B][cn:C]C[See the variation at move 37.  This move is not big enough.  More could have been acoomplished at A, B, or C.]
;B[hj];W[ii]C[A "thank you" move on White's part.  This only strengthens Black's influence towards the lower left an area that White must invade to have any chance of success.]
;B[ij]LB[lk:A]SQ[gj][hj][jj]C[White continues compounding his problems  The move at A would have been better and, of course, the invasion is still calling.

> As you said before. An invasion would have a hard time with the marked wall going around]
;W[ji]C[> This is a 1 point move that gives away sente.];B[rp]
;W[rq];B[op];W[oq];B[po];W[sp];B[ro];W[lr]C[White has now abandoned any attempt at offense.]
;B[kq]C[White now has sente and should have siezed it with both hands.  The given move is far too small.  If an invasion of the lower left is ever going to succeed now is the time to launch it.]

(;W[mp];B[mo];W[fh];B[ej];W[eh];B[dh];W[lj]C[Ronald D. Morley: A close game, though I think you have a slight edge.  (This in-game comment was an understatement if ever there was one. ;( )]
;B[gq];W[dn]LB[cn:A]C[The long awaited invasion, but one line too high.  Should have been at A to keep Black from playing under it as happened in the game.]

How has your summer been?  Mostly hot and sticky over here.

Later,

Is my opponent correct about the lower right?
