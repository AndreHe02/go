Hello, I am Vincent Cantin, also known as "karmaGfa" on KGS. I am your reviewer. I am not very specially good in opening, but I hope that my advices can help you anyway.]

Black started the chinese opening with Q16 and Q3. The usual next move is R9 instead of K4.

However K4 is still not bad, and unless you are a top Go professional player, you cannot bannish k4 from your playing style ... Go have many faces.]

My global feeling is that white waited too long before he attack the black's framework. In fact, black was also too slow to develop his game.

Even if black expended too slowly, its directions were ok.

Both players need to learn that to sacrifice a stone doesn't mean lose points.

Both players need to learn what are the move that really change the score in the end game, and stop to simply fill the center just in case the opponent would have 1 or 2 points there.

Black needs to learn that to tenuki can be good when you just leave a few points to the opponent. It is not a good idea when you leave your big framework opened to the invasion (i.e. with the move in C6). Don't be too greedy, your opponent will also have a territory, it is the game, you need to accept it. Please see any pro game, you will see that the winner never play like what you did. Both players have territory, and there is still a winner.


PS: I don't know if the submitter is the black or the white. Please inform the reviewer next time, and also please send this review to your opponent, it might help him as it may help you to make progresses.

Regards, Vincent.])
