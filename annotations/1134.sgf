C[Ankh:

This is probably my first true fighting game, When things started getting intense in all parts of the board, it seems that I spectacularly lost control over what was going on and lost, though I thought that I had an overwhelming advantage in attack. While a good part of my loss can be attributed to making a mistake in enclosing the top, I seemed to have difficilty keeping my attack going on all fronts with stable groups. Any advice on how I should think in these sorts of positions would be vastly appreciated. Thanks, for the review, and I hope that you enjoy the game.]

This didn't look overly big to me, so I tenuki.]

(;W[nd]C[Ankh:
I don't know any joseki, but after some thought, this is what I came up with. I want to either build influence or positions along the side.

jl: white must connect (see variations). Even if you don't know josekis, letting black cut at Q14 is too severe.]
;B[nc]C[Black should have cut immediately at Q14. Since black is strong in the corner, the fight will be good for black.]
;W[pd]C[Ankh: I was thinking that the cut at san-san is threatening, Is this founded?

jl: yes, black must defend. But making a forcing move is not always beneficial. Sometimes the opponent gets more than you do.]
;B[qc];W[oc];B[ob];W[mc]C[White shows fighting spirit but must be careful because of the weakness of the two stones D4-F4 which give many ko threats to black.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[ne]C[Black shows good fighting spirit too...]
;W[oc]KO[];B[cq]C[Black could also play H4 instead, this would work well with Q4.]

(;B[qk]C[Black should take advantage of the shisho which doesn't work (see variation).]
;W[qi]C[White should still capture O15 instead to connect all the white stones there and make a strong group.]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[oh]C[black overplays.]
(;W[oi]C[Ankh: This turns out badly. O13 intead?

jl: actually, it turned out very well for white. white was not strong there as long as O15 could escape. As long as white is willing to sacrifice some stones in exchange for a strong wall this can give a good result.]
;B[pj];W[nh]
(;B[pf]C[B cannot escape at P13 (see variation).];W[of];B[pg]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[og]C[All white stones are now connected, white has a strong wall, and black has captured a single stone in gote. This is a good result for white. See variation showing that O15 can no longer escape.]

(;B[rg]
(;W[kf]C[Ankh: Here I want to connect. Is one line lower better?

jl: O15 can no longer escape. D12 would be better (see variation).]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[Ankh: This pincer seems to be the only move.

jl: it is a bit too close to the very strong white wall, but it is not a bad move.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[hd];W[ec]C[Ankh: Now it gets messy...

jl: white can simply play J17 to keep the pressure on black.]
;B[ed]
(;W[ee]C[The atari is not good. black gets stronger and white gets nothing in exchange. Just play D17 (see variation).]

(;B[oq]C[Black D12 would still be severe (see variation).];W[np]

(;W[cg]C[This is not good. White must not let black isolate D9.]

(;B[bh]C[Black should play D12 instead (see variation)];W[dh]
;B[af]C[It is too early to play this.]
(;W[qn]C[This invasion is not urgent. The corner is still open at R3 anyway. White should strengthen D9 and attack the black group on the left (see variation).]
;B[qo]C[R5 is not very good because black will be cut in two groups and the corner is still open at R3.]
;W[pn]
(;B[cd]C[black could simply cut at D17.];W[cc];B[ce]C[white is in trouble now. This shows that the invasion at R6 was a bit premature.]
;W[bf];B[be];W[bg]C[This is bad because whites removes its own liberties.]
;B[ag];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj]
(;W[bk]C[white is probably too agressive here, because of the potential cut at d15. white could be more patient and play B17, waiting for an opportunity to attack to the top black group (see variation).]
;B[de];W[dc];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[ad]C[B could play A18 to get at least a ko (see variation). white would then be in big trouble. This is why B9 was too agressive.]
;W[ab];B[di]C[Nice move, but this can put the top black group in danger.]

(;W[dj]C[D10 is a very big mistake. White should play E12 (see variation).]

(;W[kh]C[Ankh: Whon I played this, things looked fairly good, despite the mess that I made. I'm looking toward what seem to be three weak point in the black position. This move, however, seems to fail utterly. What should I have played instead?

jl: white should be more patient, and just connect his top and right groups (see variation).]
