C[[lozenge\]: This game was played on August 17th in KGS. I played Black. It became my 6th loss in a row.
Thank you in advance for comments!

Hallo Matthias,

F: You played an interesting game. Since you say strategy is not your strongest part of the game, I'll comment mainly on the strategy in this game. One main point, you and your opponent overlooked, is the importance of the black stones D11-F11.  Up till move 110 you're winning the game (you've got the four corners), but you threw it away in the endgame.  Although it as your 6th loss in a row, I'm sure there is no reason to despair.
Frank];B[qc];W[dd];B[eq];W[pp]C[[lozenge\]: Lately, I've tried to play opposite corners 3-3 and 3-5. I have liked the character of such games since they tend to become small in scale, but is there something else I should take into consideration?

F: I don't think so.  You can pretty much play what you like as first moves.]

;B[fc];W[do];B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo]C[[lozenge\]: I gave a large framework for White and took some territory. Is a reduction urgent and is D11 a correct choice?

F: I don't think a reduction is urgent right now.  First of all, you have a weakness in your lower left corner (which comes apparent later in the game).  If you don't play there a move like Q10 is an alternative: it develops from your san-san stone, prepares a kakari against the lower right corner, and makes some influence to the center.]
;B[di];W[dh]C[F: This way white is getting overconcentrated, but I'm not sure what to do else for white]
;B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[dq];B[dp];W[ep];B[fp]C[F: Better capture the stone D3 immediately. This is aji-keshi.]

(;B[fo]C[[lozenge\]: I felt this tenuki is big even though it leaves the upper left unfinished. Should I have continued there or perhaps approached the lower left? Moreover, after a few moves I have ended up with an unsatisfactory shape. Is there a way around it or was it a mistake to allow white D3?

F: White is playing a center-oriented game, so now it is time to get worried about your three reducing stones D11-F11. Pushing with F5 is not the good direction. It gives white the possibility to play a splitting attack. 

You should not have white allowed to play D3 indeed.

If you want to play in this region now, you should first defend the weakness at F3. See variation]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[gm];B[hn];W[fm]C[F: Now black weakend his three middle stones a lot and still has a weakness in his lower group]
;B[fh];W[jp];B[hm]C[F: Risky. After playing K4, white could cut now. See variation on next move.]

(;W[hp]C[F: If white doesn't cut, chasing the black stones with H8 would be better]
;B[gq];W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[[lozenge\]: I think there should be enough room to approach from this side, but I got into some trouble. Could you point out my mistakes and perhaps clarify the whole fight that emerges in this part of the board? Also if there was a better way (R9?) to break this side or something more important to do, I would appreciate comments.

F: I think that you still should do something for your four black stones on the left side in the first place. H9 for example would almost connect these stones with your group on the lower side. It also threatens to attack the white stones in the lower left, so it's almost sente.

Your actual move is not bad. But you should know how to handle white 54 later.  An alternative would be R4, or S5. R9 is not so good because the right side  is  still open (your stone at R14) See variation]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[pk]C[F: I think this is an overplay.]
(;B[ln]C[[lozenge\]: I felt I had to play here because of the cut at G5 and the weaknesses at M3 and J3. Is this a bad idea?

F: There is a weakness at M3 right, but this is to far fromQR6.Now you get cut yourself. See variation.]
;W[nn];B[qk];W[qj];B[qq]C[[lozenge\]: I was a bit desperate to get something.

F: First you should do something for your QR6 stones. Now there is a chance that you get killed on both sides.]
;W[ro]C[F: Very good];B[pl];W[ok];B[nm];W[om];B[on]
(;W[ol]C[F: Too greedy. See variation];B[no];W[lp];B[mn]C[F: Now, this is a succes for black]
;W[hc]C[F: White should defend the weakness in his lower position. 
This is also the wrong diretion. White can't hope to make much territory on the upper side.]
;B[fd];W[kc]
(;B[jd]C[F: Too direct, I think. See two possible alternatives in the variations]
;W[jc];B[nc];W[id];B[jf];W[hq];B[oq]C[[lozenge\]: Here I think my opponent did some careless reading.

;B[so];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[cl];B[qg]C[[lozenge\]: Afterwards, I began to think S13 might have been better?

;B[hg];W[jj]
(;B[jl]C[F: There are bigger moves on the upper side.  See variation]
;W[jh];B[de]C[[lozenge\]: Since I could make an eye in sente I thought it was worth it.]
;W[ag];B[ec];W[bj]C[[lozenge\]: Soon, however, the K14 & K16 stones end up captured. This gives White too much, right? I would also appreciate brief comments on the endgame.]
;B[he]C[F: you make it too easy for white. Simply connecting your stones here would be enough. Very big moves are G18 and M18 (double sente)]

(;B[pi]C[[lozenge\]: This is a stupid endgame mistake of a little less than 10 points. Even without it, White had done a little better than me (komi 0.5 => W+5.5)?

F: More then 10 points. You lost the game here. See variation]
