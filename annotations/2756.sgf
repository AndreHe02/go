C[pto:
Hello, I am Tuomas from Finland (pto in KGS). 

When commenting I don't use variations so you need to do some work yourself.

Let us begin.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[nc]LB[nd:C][of:A]
[pf:B]C[A would most likely have been better use of the Q9 stone

pto:
I don't like A.  The trouble is that it leaves some openings on the corner. I would prefer B, or perhaps C. Check the standard sequences from your joseki source.

After B white would have to play another stone in this corner. After that black could enter the white left side or build moyo at the lower left corner.]
;B[ne];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]C[-];B[de]LB[ph:A]TR[pd][qd][ne]C[missed urgent point, A protects side between R16 and Q9

pto:
'A' would be overconcentrated. Look at the board after black 'A': six stones on one side!

But if you think that your shape requires 'A' then the mistake was either O15 or R16.

Final remark: how strong is the marked black shape. Think about sequence WP16-BP15-WQ15. Is it something to worry?]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[di]LB[df:B][ff:C][dg:A]C[pto:
This shape is thin. Joseki dictionary of gobase.org suggests 'A', 'B' or 'C' instead. Now this shape offers all kinds of possibilities for white, I can't really enumerate those, but anything can occur later in the game.

The key here is that black should settle this group as fast as possible so that it is rock solid later in the game.]
;W[po]LB[np:A]SQ[pk][pq]C[variation is most likely better choice

pto:
Entering into the chinese enclosure (marked stones) like this is usually considered a bad move. You play along your opponents plan.

Both tsuke at Q4 or keima at R7 will leave white plenty of room to run without giving much for black.

Keima at 'A' is the vital point agains white. It makes the running a lot more difficult for white and it builds some territory for black. Marked black stones make it difficult for white to live.]

(;B[pp];W[oo]C[pto:
Touching makes you opponent strong and/or heavy. 

Here white group is heavy, but after it has settled weaknesses in black upper right side will become imminent threat. And white has clear way to run so no troubles ahead.]
;B[lq]LB[nq:A]C[pto:
This move has idea to build territory and keep presure on the white. For this plan, the keima earlier is a lot better.

And this is too far from the black wall and white keima to 'A' might prove difficult later.]
;W[co]TR[oo][po]C[pto:
This is one of the key locations for both, but white canot really play this now. Marked white stones are dying.]
;B[qm]LB[mn:A]C[too late, should've protected bottom

pto:
In situation like this you should apply presure on the opponent to force him to defend. This is my style, and it does not suit for everyone, but I would go for a capture with ogeima at 'A'. Capturing would be finishing blow but the main aim is to put so much presure that you can build something else while fighting.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[lo];B[iq]LB[nq:A]C[pto:
This is nice, it limist the growth of the corner, applies presure on the running white group and protects agains white 'A'.]
;W[gq]LB[ld:3][ml:2][np:1]C[pto:
One plan for this situation might be attack agains the running white group. 
First  '1' is sente that protects and build the lower corner and makes the white group heavier. Then '2' would  put even more presure, and protect protect the right side and build a moyo. The last stone could then be used to prevent white framework and further enlarge the moyo.]
;B[kc]LB[ld:C][md:B][ph:A]C[would be much safer if I had protected at A

pto:
The best way to protect is to attack, and here you can do it.

This move has definite flaw, that is 'B' which will cut black badly. 'C' is still possible, but dangerous. But this direction is good, if white gets 'C' black will be in trouble with the white framework.]
;W[md]C[pto:
This move is must, it splits up black shape, prepares serious attack on black framework and it is sente because black has to protect the lonely stone.]
;B[hc];W[fc]C[pto:
I would consider this white group as strong group that does not need to be defended yet, but that is my oppinion. Good thing in this is that now it would be very difficult for black to live on the upper side.]
;B[cl]TR[de][ef][di]C[pto:
This is big because it would be nice expansion for black and white. And it if white gets it, black would propably want to protect the weak shape.]
;W[ph]C[pto:
This is kind a splitter attack. Here it is extremely dangerous for both sides. Trouble for white is that he has a running group at the bottom. But for black this means that in worst case he ends up with three running groups. There is trouble ahead. 

If the white group at the bottom right were alive game would be over.]
;B[oi]LB[ro:A]TR[pd][qd][ne]SQ[pk][qm]C[pto:
Think about the direction. Clearly this white stone has to be attacked but from where?

Remember that the direction where you attack is likely to get stronger while the other direction will propably suffer.

Then note that there is possibility for connection at 'A'. And the 'square' group has better base for eyes than the 'triangle' group.

And finally note the running white group at the bottom. One nice attack plan is to chase one weak group toward another, and just before they connect strike between. That is classical splitter attack. Force you opponent to choose which one to defend, and kill the other.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[mf]C[any advice on this series would be helpful

pto:
Black shape is crumbling: run and leave things as open as possible. So play N15 now. That allows white to perform splitter attack agains two running black groups though but may allow counter attack agains white groups at right side.]
;W[nh]LB[me:A]C[pto:
White cut at A migh be anoying.];B[oh];W[mg];B[me];W[pi];B[oj]
;W[qf]C[pto:
Solid move that settles the white group and allows black to connect.]
;B[kf]C[pto:
The first phase of white splitter has been partial success. White has removed the framework and can now attack the other half of it. But the price has been high, now the black groups at upper part are difficult target for further attacks.]
;W[nq];B[or]TR[iq][lq]C[pto:
Again a splitter type attack. Here black cannot counter attack like in the previous. He can only defend.

With this move black defends the stronger group. Only reason why marked shape is not completely dead is that also white has some weaknesses.]
;W[mp]LB[mq:A]C[pto: white tries to remove those weaknesses, but this move allows black to connect. Perhaps 'A'.]
;B[mq]C[pto:
Wrong, black can connect. This is simple and huge mistake that would cost you the game if you were agains me.]
;W[nr]LB[ro:1]TR[oh][oi][oj][pk][qm][lo][oo][po][qo][mp][iq]
[lq][mq][nq]C[pto:
Observe the situation! There are three groups that do not have eyes. White '1' will win the game for white.

First it should kill the corner if black does not play inside the corner group (try it out). And it cuts the one weak group from this corner.

After black has lived in the corner white can start killing the weak groups. Proverb: "weak group between weak opponent groups is strong group".

Go back to the beginning of the game and observe carefully how things got to this point.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[mb];W[nb];B[mc]C[pto:
White should go all out agains the bottom and leave this petty stone to black.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[nd];B[rj]C[pto:
This is good, black starts to fix things. This is defending while attacking. It threatens to turn the white group weak. But white can ignore this, if he has some guts.

Black shape is not perfect, but good enough.];W[rh];B[ro]TR[iq]
[lq][mq]C[pto:
Worst is over. But marked black stones are almost dead.];W[qp]
C[pto:
This sequence is end game. How about capturing the weak group?]
;B[qq];W[oq];B[pr];W[op]C[pto:
White is slow, inefficient and lost just his sente. 

Now black can rescue his weak group and perhaps even attack the weak white group.]
;B[qn]C[pto:
And now black is slow, inefficient and lost just his sente.]
;W[go]LB[ho:A]C[pto:
This is propably not the best move to attack the black. If I just knew what the best was...

'A' perhaps.];B[jo];W[ks];B[kr]C[pto:
Starting here comes the worst moves for black in this game. They always say that one should not say negative things in comments, but quality of following black stones are clearly below of the other.]
;W[ls];B[lr]C[pto:
What is the meaning of this move? Note how it creates simultaneusly two empty triangles.]
;W[ms];B[mr];W[lp];B[kp];W[jr];B[kq];W[ir];B[jq];W[hr]C[pto:
Here black has terrible shape, and worst of all white has connected his weak group to safety.

What to do differently? Don't let white to connect and calmly run towards the center. Black has more influence so he might be able to attack white.]
;B[jm]LB[df:A]C[pto:
Now white should forget this weak black group for a white. With black influence in the center there is no point in attacking this group. Instead white should attack the left side to remove as much black territory as possible.

I have no idea what is the best way to do this. Perhaps it is 'A'. Black influence makes it difficult for white.

If white can build some central influence, then he can start attacking the weak black group.]
;W[jj];B[lm];W[nm];B[hm];W[fm];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[ij];B[hk]
;W[li];B[mk]LB[le:A]C[pto:
White attacked too stragforwardly and now the weak black group at bottom should be ok. But how about the one black group at upper right corner? 

What about sequence starting from white 'A'? Where did this come from, has white central influence anything to do with it?]
;W[he]C[pto:
Here is no territory for black or white. Of cource black has set of weak points to worry about.]
;B[id];W[gd];B[bd]LB[df:A]C[pto:
This fixes some of the weak points in this black shape. 'A' is still annoying. There might be better alternatives but they are slow.]
;W[bb];B[jf]C[pto:
Black connects. No more weak groups in the game. Unless that one white group at the right side becomes one.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[cn];B[gi];W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh]
;W[lg];B[lf]C[pto:
This is not necesary, try to find out a way for white to cut without this (and tell me if you find one).]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[ib];W[cc];B[cd];W[bn];B[bm]
C[pto:
It is almost time for end game and this is too passive. Worst thing is monkey jump that will take max 10 points. You might first want to ask if that white group at the upper right corner wants to be captured.

It requires some heavy reading but I hope you have time for it. Life and death in real games is different from those problems you face in the books. There are all kinds of moving parts around.]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[qi]C[pto:
Even now reading this is worth some practice. I think I will go through this situation myself, but only after I have sent you this commentary ;-).

You really need to do these yourself, if you want to get strong. Remember that even cutting the tail is worth something.]
;B[gf]LB[ff:A]C[pto:
Solid 'A' might be better.];W[ej];B[ei];W[hf];B[hg];W[na]LB[lb:A]
C[pto:
'A' would have been end game tesuji for white.];B[lc];W[bc]
;B[om];W[on];B[lh];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni];B[kg]C[pto:
Useless stone.];W[ng]C[pto:
Useless. Ok this is worth one point in gote, but that is synonym for being useless.]
;B[ji];W[lk];B[ll];W[lj];B[kk]C[pto:
This shows some killer instincs, but in bloodlust way. This is gote, white should not respond. Instead white should create eyes for good.]
;W[kj];B[kl]C[pto:
Almost useless, white is almost ready to die. Perhaps if you ask really politely instead of rescuing this single stone. 

Read it! 

There are less that 20 starting points but most points should easily lead to living white group. Eliminate those first and then concentrate on the rest ;-)

Ps. Don't forget that white might also try to connect out.]
;W[pf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg]LB[gc:3][sc:1][od:7][fe:4][gn:5][mn:6]
[os:2]TR[ff][pj]C[pto:
And thus begins the endgame. Rule for the end game is that you first play the sente moves. And then play either a big move or reverse sente (a move that removes a sente from opponent).

I suck in end game so take my advice with a grain of salt.

I have enumerated  sente moves in order you should play them. The last is barely a sente but it removes one sente from you opponent and gives you one definite sente.

Of course you opponent might find even bigger sente so that instead of responding to you stone immediatelly he first plays some sequences, but sotime later he has to respond and then you continue on your end game path.

There are also fairly big moves that you might want to take yourself. That is you might want to end you sente sequence with taking one of these (the triangles for example).]
;W[sc]LB[ad:3][od:1][ff:A][dj:2][pj:B][sj:4]TR[bd][cd][de][fg]
[fh]SQ[oh][oi][oj]C[pto:
Fot white things are a bit different. Stones 1 to 4 are sente but the last two should perhaps not be played straight. This is because they are also ajikeshi, they may remove some better opportunities.

Think about white 'A'. This is sacrifice stone that tries either to invade the small teritory or to capture marked black stones.

Another similar is 'B'. It is direct capture attempt agains marked black stones but it also makes '4' much more efective (black canot play atari agains '4' after 'B').

So correct order is '1', '2', 'B', '4', 'A' and '3' if black cant block it while defending agains 'A'.]
;B[sd]C[pto:
What should really happen in end game depends on how big damage would happen if such sente is not responded.

In this situation my mind might just and just be good enough to track everything. And perhaps I try to do it, but again only after I have submitted this to you. You will learn nothing if I would just tell you what will happen. 

Try to figure it out yourself, but be prepared to do some work.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[sj];B[sk];W[si];B[rl];W[nj];B[nk];W[pj];B[ok]
;W[re];B[qe];W[an];B[am];W[hq];B[hp];W[gp]LB[ho:A]C[pto:
Playing 'A' might be better for white. Even if it is worse in territory it really criples black shape for good.]
;B[ho];W[ii];B[ih];W[mm];B[ln];W[mn];B[ol];W[gn];B[hn]TR[in]
[jn][io][ip][jp]C[pto:
Cripling the black would have reduced most of the marked teritory.]

This was a good game. Both players had good attitude and great fighting spirit. And skills in different aspects were pretty well balanced. 

Difficulty in this is that you have to improve in all aspects to get better. Think about the attacking techniques I have mentioned, and when needed take your time and read the variations.

I have the feeling that even small improvements in the sense of correct direction and positional judgement would give black a lot more strength.

Thank you.])
