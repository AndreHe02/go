(;W[qm];B[kq];W[qj];B[jd];W[og];B[md];W[mc];B[lc]C[So far so good?
as for shape yes but there are alot of holes where white could invade]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[nd];B[me];W[ne]C[latters can be good, but this one is better left for later]
;B[mf];W[no];B[hq]C[Right answe to White O5 ?
there isent really a right or wrong answer to this.  he just wants to get more tarratory so he is expanding]
;W[nj];B[jj]C[Here I really didnt know what to playbut this seemed like a logical next move for White.

yah, but it dosent really stop him from making more moves to get out for example L-5]
;W[cf]C[you should have played at C-15.
another play would be like this]
(;B[cd];W[ci];B[di];W[dh]C[Here I chose thickness but now it seemed better to cut at C12 ?

thickness is a concpet that beginners shoulednt think of i dont even think about it.  you should have played at B-11]

(;B[dj];W[bi]
(;B[df]C[seems too close .. alternative move ? 

yah i would have played some where else.  you dont have to worry about closing this off yet.  wait tell the middle game to do that.]

dont worry about attacking white.  you should build terratory not try and take it.  its easyer to play when you build it.  you make less mistakes]

C[Here may be I should have sacrificed N4 and play P8 or around there or may be L13 ? In anyway take sente]

yes];W[ck];B[dk]C[Only one eye for white];W[el];B[fm];W[ap]
C[Here comes nice play from White which I didnt see cominf at all]
;B[aq];W[bq];B[ao];W[gj]C[great Ko set up by White and because I didnt saw a way out I took B5]
;B[bn];W[fk]C[and A6];B[am]C[but I overlooked that White could connect the C6 group and thus gain liberties, lucky for me White also overloooked this.

However I should have stayed calm and played G9 instead of taking the B5 stone ...please comment! :-)]
;W[jh]C[playing at C-8 was to early.  those stones arnt going any where]

(;B[fc]C[Good thickness or unnecessary ?

it was unnecessary ill show why..];W[kd];B[ld]C[Good thickness or unnecessary ? I must admitt that i became a little paranoid after the previous adventure.

again i dont even think about thickness.  its just to an advanced level for me.  but it is a good idea to start to think.  yah paranoia is good for the person your are playing.  if you can use it for your advantage it will make you a better player.  because they will think that you will do something that you know is totaly pointless.]
;W[ke];B[kg];W[kf];B[kh];W[jg];B[lg];W[ki]C[This is a situation which I found difficucult to over looked and where i choose safety so I played K11 where now I now I could have played M11 safely, please advice.]

[hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[Not a great game because of the mistakes concerning White's invasions. For me this is still difficult to handle (as shows ;-) ) Also advice how to play more effectively. And some tips regarding counting would also come in handy.  All comments and advice is highly appreciated!

Many thanks,
Lothar.

um, even now i dont really know how to count fast.  i just cover a section with my hand and count how many hands that each person has.  that is a rough estimet that you could use.
but you really could have handled the group at E-13 better.  and have broken in to the right side earlyer to get more terratory when the walls wernt that set in stone.
so work on building your houses before attacking whites.  
when you get greedy, though, you make big mistakes.  this is why you take a life time to learn how to play your best.  not to just randomly throw the stones around like candy.
so work on that
