C[I'm struggling since I've been studying  really hard without playing.  Thank you for  reviewing the game.

*Hi Keith.  I'm David and my first  suggestion is that you review slower, more  thoughtful games than 5 minute byo yomi.   The advice I hear from really strong  players is; if you play one or two slower  serious games per week then you can play  as many fast games as you like.*]

C[I tried this...];B[op];W[mp]C[Magic dirk that I read about...fun to try new stuff]
;B[on];W[pq]C[*This seems smaller than right side (R6 or  Q7 maybe).  Black P3 would look good  now*]

C[It'd be interesting to see a move more  fitted for this situation

*This is a nice idea:  white has territory in  bottom left and bottom right, while black  has territory in upper left and upper right.   You get influence and limit black's  potential.  I like your playful/experimental  attitude.*]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[pk];W[qi];B[rj];W[ph]C[*Isn't O10 a better way to protect the cut?*]

C[Ladder to the c5 stone doesn't work...I may  have bluffed B into thinking it did, though.

*If both players screw up at the same  location it clearly indicates the game is too  fast for learning experience.  What about  the area around K17?  Looks huge from  here.*]
;B[bo];W[br];B[do];W[mo];B[nn];W[jq];B[jo]C[How to respond to this?

*Proverb is respond with knight's move to  cap (H4), but locally I think K4 and J4 are  good options to prevent black L3 aji.  But I  still think white splitting the top is bigger  than preventing black splitting the bottom.*]
;W[jp];B[io];W[hp];B[ko];W[gn]C[*Useful - reduces left side and threatens  cutting off three black stones.*]
;B[jl];W[ln];B[mn];W[lo];B[km];W[lm];B[mm]C[This sequence seemed really bad for B

*I agree.  Having a small knight's move cut  straight through is worse shape than an  empty triangle.*]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mj];B[lk];W[kk];B[mk];W[kl];B[jm];W[lj];B[jk]
;W[mb]C[*K17 or M17 look better to me.  Second  line moves are for special purposes.*]
;B[nb];W[mc];B[nc];W[ic];B[hc];W[jc]C[This move looks weird to me...

*Why not choose from usual multiple  choice (hane top, hane bottom, extend top,  extend bottom)?*]
;B[hb];W[hd];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[id];B[fe];W[gf];B[fc];W[if]
;B[ma];W[mf]C[*Doesn't black's potential for territory on  the left side seem bigger than this area?*]
;B[md];W[kb];B[lb];W[lc];B[ld];W[la];B[na]C[Was n14 worth it?

*No - see previous comment.*];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[kf];W[kd]

;W[kg];B[qb];W[lg];B[gl];W[cj]C[*Hooray*];B[cl];W[cg]C[*Now it is an easy win for white.*]
;B[bf];W[pa]C[This is wrong...Is there a way to kill the  group?

*If it can't be reduced to less than six  spaces from outside it usually can't be  killed by placements inside.*]
;B[pb];W[oe];B[el];W[od];B[oc];W[dk];B[dl];W[fj];B[kp];W[lq]
C[*Isn't L3 better?  Even if the aji of the black  stone at P4 scared you, white has K10 or  L10 or S4 to prevent any funny business.*]

;B[en]C[This seemed really bad for B, and was the opposite of what I didn't want him to play]
;W[fn];B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[kn];B[fm];W[ef]C[*Learn to like solid moves like F14.  See  variation for black's next move.*]

(;B[ee]C[The variation shows the most  simple-minded path for black.  A better  player would punish white E14 more  severely.]
;W[ff];B[ji];W[hi];B[ih];W[ij];B[jj];W[hh];B[jf];W[jg]C[*Can you see white is weak because of  H15?  J13 is stronger than 148.*]

;B[sh];W[sg];B[si];W[rg];B[qe]C[Could I have played r16 here?

*No - see variation next move for simple  gain for black.*]

(;W[re];B[qd];W[bj];B[aj]C[b12 was best here, right?

*B12 is better than 173.*];W[bg];B[bi];W[ck];B[bl];W[ci];B[bh]
;W[ch];B[ag];W[cf];B[be];W[fk];B[ek];W[gm]C[The game would have ended up pretty  close without this, right?

*All amateur games have huge swings  back and forth that pro games don't have.   In kyu games anything can happen.   Witness the upcoming silliness in lower  left.  My two generic comments are:  1)  slow down and think, and 2) learn not to  leave weaknesses when a solid move  works.*  END OF REVIEW]
