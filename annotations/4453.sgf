C[al> Dear Reviewer, thanks for taking the time to analyse this game. I play white, and won, but as it turned out, the result hinged on the situation in the top left corner, which we agreed on being a seki. So, one question is: was this correct?

al> Another issue is how to play when you are in the lead. I am not used to that, as I most often take chances and end up fighting for my life all over the board. I would appreciate some pointers on how to think, besides the basic "if you are in the lead, prioritize enlarging your own territory, instead instead of reducing the opponent's".

Fernando (from now kokorini): hi, I will make the review of this game. I will try to answer your questions, but allways take it just as an opinion.
i was 7-8 kyuu in KGS before the admins re sort the ranks... I guess now I´m about 5 or 6 in kgs... so dont take my word very seriusly, only pro players can say thing "seriusly" for the rest of us... well we are just guessing :)

Any questions please feel free.];B[dd];W[pd]C[Allan Wickberg: Enjoy!]
;B[eq];W[qp];B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[pq];W[qq];B[no]C[Kokorini (reviewer): weird move. I feel like black is forcing white to make territory.]
;W[pm]TR[pl]C[Kokorini: perhaps to close I prefer Q9. another reason is that white is leaving too much space free between Q7 and upperleft corner to do things like.........]
;B[qf]C[Kokorini: ........this.
but anyway this move should be played later I think];W[qh];B[qc]
;W[qd];B[pc]C[K: I think black is making white too strong on the right side]
;W[oc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[ip]

(;W[cl]C[al> I thought I needed a ladder breaker here, so I did not play closer to the corner, in case black would pincer.

Kokorini: no need... look variation];B[ci];W[co];B[cp];W[cf]
C[Kokorini: white should remember later the weakness that he just left behind at D5 and...
I dont like this side right now... is better the other I think. May be if C5 group was stronger this is very possible]
;B[ce];W[df]C[K: now C11 stone is right there, where it hurts]
;B[fd];W[cc]C[al> This is initally just a throw-in to create some future possibility, but it evolved into a full out corner invasion. I was not expecting it to survive, but I had to find out if it could.

al> Would it have been better to come from the other direction, maybe, to make use of the N17 group?

Kokorini: as I say... before was better in the other direccion, now if you play on top you will put in danger C14 stones.
be aware for the sente becouse black have 2 very "hurts" move: something with C5 stone like playing D5 and just a dobble step extention at E11]
;B[cd];W[bc];B[dc];W[bd];B[be];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ab]C[K: ouch]
;W[ea];B[fb];W[fa];B[gb];W[da];B[ba];W[ad];B[bf];W[bb]C[al> Seki, or so I think. I read somewhere that this turns into a bent four in the corner, but I cannot make it get there. It looks like something that has to be classical, though, so I guess there is a "right answer"?

Kokorini: yes... white group is dead and it is not seki. It simple will end in a ko that Black can decide when start.
I will show you why.... se variation.]
(;B[bg]C[ok... lets continue with the game....];W[gq];B[hq]
;W[kq]C[Kokorini: for those that doesn´t saw the game before like I did, you will see that white like fighting :)]
;B[ko];W[mq];B[nq];W[nr];B[or];W[lr];B[lp]C[K: Mmhh....  I think is better to remove base.. like K2]
;W[ir];B[hr];W[jp];B[jo];W[iq];B[hp];W[kp]
(;B[lq]C[K: white should be very happy....  black move is K2]
;W[jr];B[mp];W[el]C[White is playing with fire, his group need another move on the base and will be running between 2 forces.
well played, white could live but right side could end very small  after some chase. I think]
;B[fi];W[pf];B[kc]C[K: black should attack white C5 group];W[dp]
;B[cq];W[ep];B[fq];W[io]C[K: I dont like thi one.... black is strong enoght to ignore this move]
;B[gl];W[gj]C[al> I wanted to pick a fight in the center, hoping to get strong towards the right side, in order to increase the potential real estate there. It felt too meek to play around R9.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[ii];W[hi];B[hh];W[ih];B[hg];W[jh];B[jj];W[mr]
C[al> I did not want to make it too easy for the black group to live. I was hoping to be able to push harder from the right down onto this group to build my moyo.

Kokorini: Ok, I understand your idea, but if it works is becouse black isnt punishing you for your overplays.
simple by playing F9 black is save.]
(;B[jl];W[ji];B[ij];W[dq]C[al> I was about to play around N8 when I decided I should settle my lower left group first.

K: better than never :P];B[dr];W[cr];B[br];W[bq];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[aq];W[fp];B[er];W[gr];B[gp];W[hs];B[gn]C[al> This came much as a suprise. Might have been a typo on black's part.

K: ouch.. black misstake];W[go];B[in];W[ho];B[hn];W[ke]C[al> By now, black was so solid in the lower center, that I thought it better to tighten my upper center instead.

Kokorini: Center look like the most important area I think. and more after this white move]
;B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[he];W[kd];B[fj];W[ln]C[al> Looking back, this seems overly aggressive. Maybe I was expecting black to try to play around N7, in which case I could have faked a "rescue attempt" that could have helped me build the right side moyo.]
;B[lo];W[nn]
(;B[km];W[kj];B[kk];W[lk];B[ll];W[lj]C[al> I believe I am letting black reduce much too much here - or am I just greedy?


Kokorini: I was analizing this situacion and I really cant tell you be sure but...
I think you are too greedy, not now but before.... for example for the variation a made to the move b129, you are too greedy there becouse you are not keeping in mind the idea that black can do something like that. (or getting much more in)]

[ar][cr][pr][as][bs][ds][ps]C[Allan Wickberg: Any thoughts on the top left corner? I have been reading up on the "bent four", but this really looks like a seki to me.
Jürgen: All things are alike to me. We can define the corner as seki. I think that is correct in this game. OK?
Allan Wickberg: OK, then. Of course, I gain from it, but I think I submit the game for review on the GTL. That may possibly shed some light om this position. I will keep you posted.

Thanks for the game - it was interesting!

White: 75 territories + 7 prisoners + 3.0 komi = 85
Black: 59 territories + 13 prisoners = 72
Result: W+13

Kokorini:
for white: try to be a little less agressive, don´t forget to do important moves.
for black: try to be a little more agressive, dont forget to punnish forgotten moves!

for the game: black wins for the upper left corner.]N[RESULT]
